[00:18.240 --> 00:20.640]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:20.640 --> 00:22.400]  It's time for episode number 68
[00:22.400 --> 00:24.320]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.320 --> 00:28.220]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.220 --> 00:30.200]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.200 --> 00:32.000]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.240]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.240 --> 00:34.400]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.400 --> 00:36.060]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.060 --> 00:37.880]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.880 --> 00:38.760]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:38.760 --> 00:40.320]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:40.320 --> 00:42.200]  As always, I wanna send a big thank you shout out
[00:42.200 --> 00:43.120]  to the Mystic Roots Band
[00:43.120 --> 00:44.560]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[00:44.600 --> 00:48.960]  Big thanks to Kat Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:48.960 --> 00:49.880]  What's up, everybody?
[00:49.880 --> 00:51.200]  I'm not gonna do any ads this episode
[00:51.200 --> 00:53.360]  because I have a lot of stuff written down.
[00:54.560 --> 00:56.560]  I'm gonna drop that music out a little bit.
[00:56.560 --> 00:57.400]  I've been telling you guys
[00:57.400 --> 00:59.700]  that I'm gonna do a lesson on grow room scheduling.
[00:59.700 --> 01:01.260]  Well, I've started working on that
[01:01.260 --> 01:03.620]  and I have got a lot of information.
[01:03.620 --> 01:04.800]  Before I get to that part,
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.520]  I wanna talk about a couple of things.
[01:06.520 --> 01:09.440]  I went and got my medical marijuana card renewed
[01:09.440 --> 01:10.920]  a couple of days ago.
[01:10.920 --> 01:12.320]  I was thinking I should talk about that on the show.
[01:12.320 --> 01:13.920]  I'm gonna turn down the music real quiet here
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.360]  and just start the show right now.
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.320]  No ads this time, you guys, no ads.
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.000]  Quick shout out to Hygro and their growing supplies
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.120]  and super huge shout out to Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.580]  and Nature's Green Remedies.
[01:22.580 --> 01:24.180]  That's my ads for today.
[01:24.180 --> 01:25.640]  I got a lot to talk about.
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.640]  I got my medical marijuana card renewed.
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.760]  Dude, the process has gotten super simple.
[01:32.040 --> 01:33.520]  I pretty much called, made an appointment.
[01:33.520 --> 01:34.680]  I showed up.
[01:34.680 --> 01:36.840]  They got me in at my scheduled appointment time.
[01:36.840 --> 01:38.120]  That's the first time that's ever happened
[01:38.120 --> 01:40.440]  at a medical marijuana doctor.
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.280]  They got me in there.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.200]  They got me seen.
[01:42.320 --> 01:45.680]  They got my, it's not a license, you guys.
[01:45.680 --> 01:47.200]  It bugs me for some reason
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.200]  because nobody here has a marijuana license.
[01:49.200 --> 01:52.440]  It's a medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor.
[01:52.440 --> 01:53.280]  It's not a prescription.
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.240]  It's not a license.
[01:54.240 --> 01:56.200]  So he writes out a recommendation for you.
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.240]  And then, I was debating it
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.760]  if I wanted to talk about this or not.
[02:00.760 --> 02:02.380]  On the table in the doctor's office,
[02:02.380 --> 02:04.840]  there's just a little sign and it says,
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.160]  increased plant count will require records.
[02:07.160 --> 02:10.240]  And then there's a dollar sign and then an amount of plants
[02:10.360 --> 02:12.360]  and then another dollar sign and an amount of plants.
[02:12.360 --> 02:15.600]  And if you provide records and you tell this doctor
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.320]  that you are in need of a higher plant count,
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.280]  he will increase your plant count for a small fee.
[02:21.280 --> 02:22.760]  So if you're not a Colorado resident
[02:22.760 --> 02:24.480]  and if you're not familiar with all that,
[02:24.480 --> 02:26.200]  what that means is when you go to this doctor,
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.720]  when you get your medical marijuana card,
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.280]  you are now allowed to grow six plants
[02:31.280 --> 02:32.840]  in your private residence.
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.500]  These doctors are now able to write in recommendations
[02:36.500 --> 02:38.880]  that you are able to grow more cannabis
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.200]  and possess more cannabis than the original six.
[02:42.200 --> 02:44.000]  But to do that, you've got to bring a little bit
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.080]  of doctor note, some sort of history,
[02:46.080 --> 02:48.520]  some sort of records saying that something's wrong with you
[02:48.520 --> 02:50.840]  and you also have to pay a fee.
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.960]  So for a small fee, I walked out of there
[02:52.960 --> 02:54.080]  with a handsome plant count.
[02:54.080 --> 02:55.360]  I won't talk about the numbers on the show.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.560]  I don't really have a huge plant count.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.400]  I don't need that many.
[02:57.400 --> 02:58.800]  I just want it to be safe.
[02:58.800 --> 03:00.120]  So, and I went for what he would give me
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.360]  just to see if he would do it.
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.760]  And I got the highest he offered there.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.340]  So that was super easy.
[03:05.340 --> 03:09.100]  I wanted to talk about the benefits of doing that.
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.140]  The reason I did it is because of course I grow
[03:11.140 --> 03:12.660]  and I want to keep my grow protected
[03:12.660 --> 03:15.100]  with my medical marijuana card.
[03:15.100 --> 03:17.080]  That allows me, it gives me a little bit more safety
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.300]  I feel like, and also the recreational shops
[03:20.300 --> 03:21.580]  are really high priced.
[03:21.580 --> 03:24.900]  If you were to buy a gram of hash at a recreational shop,
[03:24.900 --> 03:26.900]  it would cost you probably twice as much
[03:26.900 --> 03:28.460]  as it would at a medical shop.
[03:28.460 --> 03:33.340]  So I keep my medical marijuana privileges intact
[03:33.380 --> 03:36.540]  a lot for that because sometimes I do run out of shatter
[03:36.540 --> 03:38.620]  and I have to go, I go up to Green and Healthy Wellness
[03:38.620 --> 03:41.740]  in Colorado Springs and I purchase grams of hash
[03:41.740 --> 03:45.180]  from our friends Hunt and the Jordans and the Johns
[03:45.180 --> 03:47.380]  up at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[03:47.380 --> 03:49.580]  So that's a good reason to keep my
[03:49.580 --> 03:52.700]  medical marijuana card intact.
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.940]  So I talked about the benefits.
[03:53.940 --> 03:56.140]  I talked about the process and I talked about the cost.
[03:56.140 --> 03:58.060]  I feel like it covered the medical marijuana card experience.
[03:58.060 --> 03:59.900]  It was super easy this time.
[03:59.900 --> 04:01.300]  I'm not going to say the doctor's name
[04:01.300 --> 04:02.260]  or anything on the podcast,
[04:02.260 --> 04:03.940]  but if you'd like his information, just email me.
[04:03.940 --> 04:05.340]  It's growfromyourhearthotmail.com
[04:05.340 --> 04:06.260]  and I'll get you that doctor.
[04:06.260 --> 04:07.880]  He is in Pueblo, Colorado.
[04:07.880 --> 04:09.900]  So if you're looking for a doctor in Pueblo,
[04:09.900 --> 04:11.660]  I've got a recommendation for you.
[04:11.660 --> 04:12.960]  Let's move on to my next topic.
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.260]  I really want to get to the grow lesson,
[04:14.260 --> 04:17.540]  but I've got a few things written down that I want to cover.
[04:17.540 --> 04:19.180]  This is just kind of a personal thing.
[04:19.180 --> 04:22.100]  I keep seeing a lot of people talking about
[04:22.100 --> 04:24.080]  the temperature of their e-nail.
[04:25.020 --> 04:27.920]  The e-nail is the little box that plugs into the wall.
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.760]  That's got an LED or an LCD display on there.
[04:32.760 --> 04:33.600]  It's usually an LED, right?
[04:33.600 --> 04:36.280]  Little LED light display, shows numbers,
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.800]  and then it's got an up and down switch on it.
[04:37.800 --> 04:39.560]  You can make the temperature hotter and cooler.
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.700]  And then the one I have actually has a USB port in it
[04:41.700 --> 04:42.720]  so that you can charge your iPhone
[04:42.720 --> 04:44.280]  or whatever kind of phone you got on there.
[04:44.280 --> 04:45.520]  But then it's got a little cord that comes out
[04:45.520 --> 04:47.060]  and it attaches to the nail
[04:47.060 --> 04:48.520]  and it heats up the nail for you all the time.
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.360]  So that's the e-nail.
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.080]  And then your dad nail is always hot, right?
[04:52.680 --> 04:55.260]  The temperature on your nail
[04:56.260 --> 04:59.700]  does not match what the numbers on that box say.
[04:59.700 --> 05:00.960]  That's what I'm trying to get to here.
[05:00.960 --> 05:02.740]  That's going to be my point.
[05:02.740 --> 05:04.940]  A lot of people say they've seen pictures of my e-nail
[05:04.940 --> 05:07.780]  and right now it's flashing at 852.
[05:07.780 --> 05:10.280]  It's jumping between 850 and 852.
[05:11.260 --> 05:12.900]  And honestly, if you tried to take a dab
[05:12.900 --> 05:15.520]  with that at 852 degrees, I feel like that'd be too hot.
[05:15.520 --> 05:17.720]  But that is not a representation of degrees.
[05:17.720 --> 05:20.460]  That is simply a setting on the box.
[05:20.460 --> 05:23.780]  I don't think that, and maybe there is one brand,
[05:23.780 --> 05:25.180]  maybe one or two brands that does this,
[05:26.060 --> 05:28.300]  but I don't think that that coil
[05:28.300 --> 05:31.300]  is sending the temperature to that nail
[05:31.300 --> 05:32.260]  and all the way back to there
[05:32.260 --> 05:34.380]  and telling it that it's 860 degrees.
[05:34.380 --> 05:38.220]  That is more of a setting like a,
[05:38.220 --> 05:40.620]  like if you turn your volume on your car stereo to 11,
[05:40.620 --> 05:42.380]  you're not putting out 11 anythings.
[05:42.380 --> 05:43.460]  You're just on 11.
[05:43.460 --> 05:45.860]  You know that 11 is, like I know that my car stereo,
[05:45.860 --> 05:47.140]  I can crank it up to about 28
[05:47.140 --> 05:49.980]  before the subwoofer starts sounding like complete crap.
[05:49.980 --> 05:53.460]  So I know that 26 is my ideal temp on my car stereo.
[05:53.460 --> 05:56.100]  It doesn't mean I'm putting out 26 anything in particulars.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.700]  It's just the level where it is.
[05:57.700 --> 06:00.100]  And that's what I think your emails are doing.
[06:00.100 --> 06:04.060]  We have established that the 860 I'm seeing on my screen
[06:04.060 --> 06:06.800]  right now on my LED is actually a frequency
[06:06.800 --> 06:08.460]  that is being put out.
[06:08.460 --> 06:11.940]  And that's what's being measured by that number.
[06:11.940 --> 06:14.620]  So you gotta keep in mind that that number
[06:14.620 --> 06:16.300]  has to travel all the way down the cord,
[06:16.300 --> 06:17.740]  and then it has to get to the coil.
[06:17.740 --> 06:19.860]  And that coil is the heating part.
[06:19.860 --> 06:22.420]  That coil has to heat whatever type of nail you're using.
[06:22.420 --> 06:24.780]  I'm using this new highly educated,
[06:24.780 --> 06:26.300]  it's the E-Nail Insert.
[06:26.300 --> 06:27.140]  Which one is it?
[06:27.140 --> 06:27.960]  It's got the name printed on it.
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.020]  Let me read it.
[06:29.020 --> 06:31.100]  I knew the name until I started talking.
[06:31.100 --> 06:35.700]  It is the HED adapter.
[06:35.700 --> 06:36.660]  So I'm using that one.
[06:36.660 --> 06:38.760]  So you've got to heat up this barrel shaped piece,
[06:38.760 --> 06:40.740]  and then the head of the nail heats up after that,
[06:40.740 --> 06:42.300]  because the heat's got to travel.
[06:42.300 --> 06:45.620]  So for it to know what the exact heat is
[06:45.620 --> 06:48.860]  on the head of that nail would be kind of ridiculous
[06:48.860 --> 06:49.980]  to ask of that device.
[06:49.980 --> 06:52.500]  So my point is, that number doesn't match
[06:52.500 --> 06:53.620]  the head of the nail.
[06:53.620 --> 06:57.140]  You guys, that is a frequency or a dial setting.
[06:57.140 --> 06:59.540]  So when you find the ideal number,
[06:59.540 --> 07:00.900]  just remember that ideal number,
[07:00.900 --> 07:02.500]  and that's kind of where you want to be.
[07:02.500 --> 07:05.160]  You're not actually getting at 856 degrees,
[07:05.160 --> 07:07.660]  or I've seen some of them set at perfectly 710,
[07:07.660 --> 07:09.740]  because people think that's the perfect temp.
[07:09.740 --> 07:11.780]  That number is not correlating to the nail, you guys.
[07:11.780 --> 07:14.260]  So when you see my pictures and it's at 850,
[07:14.260 --> 07:15.100]  quit bitching at me.
[07:15.100 --> 07:17.100]  I think that's my point here.
[07:17.100 --> 07:19.700]  All right, I have another topic written down.
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.540]  But the iPhone has locked me out.
[07:21.540 --> 07:22.460]  Here we go.
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.580]  The next one, oh, the pesticide issue.
[07:24.580 --> 07:27.220]  Man, we talked about this a little bit
[07:28.100 --> 07:29.300]  in a previous episode.
[07:29.300 --> 07:32.300]  I talked about some of the dispensaries that got in trouble,
[07:32.300 --> 07:34.260]  and I saw a quick article.
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.100]  Scroll through my phone here.
[07:35.100 --> 07:37.460]  I should have been a little more prepared.
[07:37.460 --> 07:40.540]  People are kind of upset about this pesticide issue,
[07:40.540 --> 07:42.420]  and here is what I saw.
[07:42.420 --> 07:43.880]  This was all over,
[07:44.780 --> 07:46.900]  it was all over social media websites today.
[07:46.900 --> 07:49.540]  It says, pesticide violations were issued
[07:50.380 --> 07:52.620]  to the following recreational marijuana grow facilities.
[07:52.620 --> 07:54.900]  And then it lists, Mindful, Green Solutions,
[07:54.900 --> 07:57.540]  Evolutionary Holdings, Green Cross Colorado,
[07:57.540 --> 08:01.500]  MMJ America, Organic Greens, Altitude East Treatments,
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.580]  RINO, and Sweet Leaf.
[08:03.580 --> 08:06.260]  All violators were using EGLE-20
[08:06.260 --> 08:07.940]  and petroleum-based fungicide
[08:07.940 --> 08:10.420]  that is harmful to humans and animals.
[08:10.420 --> 08:13.300]  Altitude East Treatments was also using Mallet and Avid,
[08:13.300 --> 08:15.660]  both harmful to humans and animals.
[08:15.660 --> 08:17.900]  Green Cross Denver was also using Mallet.
[08:17.900 --> 08:19.860]  Many of these violations are well-known.
[08:19.860 --> 08:22.460]  And then it goes on to talk about a lot more stuff.
[08:22.460 --> 08:24.020]  You know, I don't know the original source of that
[08:24.020 --> 08:25.360]  because I've seen it cut and pasted
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.380]  on so many different social media sites
[08:27.380 --> 08:29.300]  that I don't know who to give credit to that.
[08:29.300 --> 08:34.220]  But these guys were spraying EGLE-20 on plants
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.760]  and then selling those buds to people.
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.860]  And the weird part here is,
[08:37.860 --> 08:40.420]  MMJ America just won a cannabis cup.
[08:40.420 --> 08:41.620]  So what's going on with that?
[08:41.620 --> 08:44.500]  These guys are, did they enter their EGLE-20-laden buds
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.460]  into the cannabis cup,
[08:45.460 --> 08:48.500]  or are they growing separate cups or separate crops
[08:48.500 --> 08:49.320]  and entering that
[08:49.320 --> 08:51.500]  and not even giving the public a chance to go buy that?
[08:51.500 --> 08:55.040]  Because I suspect that that's what some of the shops do.
[08:55.040 --> 08:57.340]  So these plants have been taken off the market.
[08:57.340 --> 08:59.800]  Those plants will never make it to harvest.
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.700]  And those buds will never be sold to customers or patients.
[09:02.700 --> 09:06.440]  But I'm sure that there was medicine or product
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.460]  that did make it out of the door
[09:08.460 --> 09:10.260]  and has been treated with EGLE-20
[09:10.260 --> 09:11.900]  or whatever else they were listing here
[09:11.900 --> 09:14.440]  that we definitely should not be consuming.
[09:14.440 --> 09:15.920]  Now, if this were to happen to,
[09:15.920 --> 09:17.800]  if these were tomatoes and they discovered
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.240]  that these people had been spraying tomatoes
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.640]  with these products,
[09:20.640 --> 09:23.440]  the tomato farmer or distributor
[09:23.440 --> 09:24.880]  or whoever's in charge at that point
[09:24.880 --> 09:27.700]  would have to go make some sort of a press release
[09:27.700 --> 09:28.540]  and apologize.
[09:28.540 --> 09:30.180]  They'd have to be held accountable.
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.440]  This would have been a much larger deal
[09:31.440 --> 09:34.220]  if this would have been another agricultural product
[09:34.220 --> 09:35.840]  or a horticultural product.
[09:35.840 --> 09:38.260]  And what's ridiculous is the cannabis industry
[09:38.260 --> 09:39.800]  makes so much money
[09:39.800 --> 09:43.280]  that they should have been kind of on top of this
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.640]  and been doing the right thing anyway.
[09:45.640 --> 09:47.080]  Like we're getting illegal cannabis here
[09:47.080 --> 09:48.800]  and then we're trying to set the pace here
[09:48.800 --> 09:51.080]  and then they're gonna go and do shit like this,
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.360]  which really puts, I don't know,
[09:52.360 --> 09:55.260]  kind of a black eye on the legal cannabis industry.
[09:55.260 --> 09:56.100]  I don't know.
[09:56.100 --> 09:57.760]  I think that the people that were leading the industry
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.560]  should have been more responsible with our industry.
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.800]  All right, so I can't say to not shop at those stores
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.640]  or anything like that.
[10:04.640 --> 10:05.460]  Do what you wanna do,
[10:05.460 --> 10:06.600]  but I would definitely pay more attention
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.400]  to where my medicine is coming from.
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.380]  And I would pay more attention
[10:09.380 --> 10:11.480]  to what's going in my medicine.
[10:11.480 --> 10:13.760]  All the more reason you guys to grow your own cannabis.
[10:13.760 --> 10:14.800]  That's my solution.
[10:14.800 --> 10:15.840]  That's what I think.
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.940]  All right, I've got a couple of more notes.
[10:16.940 --> 10:19.160]  What else did I wanna get onto?
[10:19.160 --> 10:21.600]  Actually, we're gonna, let's just get right to it.
[10:21.600 --> 10:24.040]  I wanna talk about grow room scheduling, you guys.
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.600]  We're 10 minutes into the show already
[10:25.600 --> 10:27.920]  and I've got a lot of notes here.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.560]  So this is probably gonna end up taking us
[10:31.560 --> 10:33.800]  a couple of episodes here, honestly.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.960]  So we're gonna get through the veg process today
[10:36.960 --> 10:38.680]  and then the next lesson
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.280]  will be planning your flowering cycles.
[10:42.280 --> 10:44.880]  So I wrote a whole bunch of stuff and honestly,
[10:44.880 --> 10:46.560]  it took me a little bit to get this together
[10:46.560 --> 10:49.360]  because, and I'm gonna apologize right now.
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.840]  I know that the last few episodes have been a little wonky.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.480]  I seriously had a major concussion
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.440]  and I can't focus to write long things like I used to,
[10:57.440 --> 10:58.520]  long lessons and shit.
[10:58.520 --> 11:00.480]  It's coming back to me slowly,
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.880]  but it takes me a little more effort
[11:01.880 --> 11:05.000]  and a lot more time to focus and write down shit.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.600]  So please bear with me, but the lessons are coming back.
[11:07.600 --> 11:08.440]  Things are getting better.
[11:09.180 --> 11:10.020]  I know that things have not been
[11:10.020 --> 11:11.300]  the way they should be with the show,
[11:11.300 --> 11:12.700]  but I have not been the way I should be.
[11:12.700 --> 11:14.240]  So I couldn't bring you the show you needed.
[11:14.240 --> 11:15.620]  I'm getting my shit back together,
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.040]  which means the show is getting its shit back together too.
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.480]  I apologize for being kind of slacking off,
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.980]  but I didn't even know.
[11:22.980 --> 11:24.500]  When you get a head injury,
[11:24.500 --> 11:25.720]  you don't know what the hell's going on
[11:25.720 --> 11:26.760]  and it's crazy weird.
[11:26.760 --> 11:28.660]  So I'm getting back to it
[11:28.660 --> 11:29.740]  and the show's getting back to it.
[11:29.740 --> 11:30.800]  So let me prove that to you.
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.460]  Here's what I've written and I have got a lot here.
[11:34.460 --> 11:36.220]  I think I'm gonna try to read it off the computer
[11:36.220 --> 11:37.620]  because the phone screen is tiny.
[11:37.640 --> 11:40.160]  Let's pull up the same thing here on the phone.
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.160]  Same thing on the computer.
[11:41.160 --> 11:41.980]  Does it match?
[11:41.980 --> 11:43.360]  No, this one's not updated.
[11:43.360 --> 11:45.740]  All right, we're just gonna read it off the phone.
[11:45.740 --> 11:47.600]  It goes like this.
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.720]  So an average growth should take about 100 to 120 days,
[11:51.720 --> 11:53.560]  maybe 150 days total in the soil
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.680]  before harvesting, drying, trimming, and curing.
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.200]  Our goal is to provide our plants with optimal conditions,
[12:00.200 --> 12:01.960]  appropriate feedings, careful training,
[12:01.960 --> 12:03.960]  and selective pruning in order to produce
[12:03.960 --> 12:05.440]  the finest medicine we can offer
[12:05.460 --> 12:07.620]  to our patients or clients.
[12:07.620 --> 12:09.740]  I think that every day in each cycle
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.620]  is an opportunity to show the plant some love
[12:11.620 --> 12:13.740]  and help your crop reach its full potential.
[12:13.740 --> 12:16.220]  I feel like each feeding, each application of teas,
[12:16.220 --> 12:17.640]  bug sprays, foliar feeding,
[12:17.640 --> 12:19.700]  and any interaction with your plants
[12:19.700 --> 12:21.300]  is your chance to make sure your crop
[12:21.300 --> 12:22.900]  reaches your client's expectations
[12:22.900 --> 12:24.980]  and the plant's full potential.
[12:24.980 --> 12:26.380]  A great way to improve your crops
[12:26.380 --> 12:28.480]  is to start a solid grow schedule.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.420]  Today I wanna talk about two different schedules
[12:30.420 --> 12:31.860]  a grower should be on top of.
[12:31.860 --> 12:34.860]  The first schedule will be the basic planning of a crop
[12:34.880 --> 12:37.320]  from seed to clone all the way up to harvest time.
[12:37.320 --> 12:39.440]  I want to discuss the phases of growth
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.040]  from a small clone or seedling into vegetative growth
[12:42.040 --> 12:43.520]  into the flowering phase.
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.860]  I wanna break down the flowering phase into trimesters
[12:45.860 --> 12:47.320]  and talk about what the plants are doing
[12:47.320 --> 12:49.840]  and what they want through the flowering phase.
[12:49.840 --> 12:51.960]  I'll also talk about what you could be doing
[12:51.960 --> 12:54.100]  at each phase to improve your harvest.
[12:55.440 --> 12:56.600]  I wrote here that if I can get you
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.200]  through 120 day grow lesson in this episode,
[12:59.200 --> 13:01.880]  I'll start my discussion on planning a schedule
[13:01.880 --> 13:04.000]  that keeps your grow space producing as much herb
[13:04.020 --> 13:06.980]  as possible with as little downtime as possible.
[13:06.980 --> 13:08.620]  This of course will take multiple lights
[13:08.620 --> 13:10.660]  and at least two small grow spaces,
[13:10.660 --> 13:12.440]  but setting up a small perpetual grow
[13:12.440 --> 13:14.520]  to keep yourself supplied with head stash
[13:14.520 --> 13:16.720]  is probably easier than you think.
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.440]  I realize now that I've written way too much
[13:18.440 --> 13:20.140]  for one episode, so this is definitely
[13:20.140 --> 13:21.880]  gonna be broken down you guys.
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.400]  So here's where we get into it.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.440]  Before you begin your grow,
[13:24.440 --> 13:26.040]  I suggest getting yourself a planner
[13:26.040 --> 13:27.760]  and making a schedule in advance.
[13:27.760 --> 13:29.920]  You can be flexible because these are plants,
[13:29.920 --> 13:31.780]  but try to stick with your plan if you can.
[13:31.820 --> 13:35.060]  I also suggest taking a lot of notes, you guys.
[13:35.060 --> 13:36.100]  Take a lot of notes.
[13:36.100 --> 13:38.500]  Don't wonder what you did to that plant
[13:38.500 --> 13:39.860]  to make it so special.
[13:39.860 --> 13:42.780]  Write down what you did so that you know.
[13:42.780 --> 13:43.900]  All right.
[13:43.900 --> 13:47.820]  So here's where I'll describe the phases of growth
[13:47.820 --> 13:49.100]  and timeframes of our plant.
[13:49.100 --> 13:52.180]  I said that this grow is gonna take about 100 to 120 days.
[13:52.180 --> 13:55.540]  If you wanna go larger plants, you can go up to 150.
[13:55.540 --> 13:57.140]  I've seen people take a lot longer.
[13:57.140 --> 13:58.780]  That's the veg period is what's gonna make
[13:58.780 --> 13:59.620]  your difference there.
[14:00.220 --> 14:02.260]  We'll start off with seedlings or clones, right?
[14:02.260 --> 14:03.980]  And that's gonna take about 14 days
[14:03.980 --> 14:06.220]  to be in the seedling phase.
[14:06.220 --> 14:08.380]  I think about 14 days when you start germinating it.
[14:08.380 --> 14:10.880]  From the day you germinate it to the day
[14:10.880 --> 14:12.660]  it's like a little plant, it's about 14 days.
[14:12.660 --> 14:14.460]  We're gonna call that 14 days.
[14:14.460 --> 14:16.460]  A clone takes about 14 days to root
[14:16.460 --> 14:17.600]  and get ready to be a plant.
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.160]  So I'm gonna say seedling and clone phase is about 14 days.
[14:21.160 --> 14:23.540]  The veg growth depends on your goal, you guys.
[14:23.540 --> 14:26.200]  If you wanna veg, if you're going in small pots,
[14:26.200 --> 14:27.460]  you can veg for two weeks.
[14:27.460 --> 14:29.080]  If you're gonna go into larger pots,
[14:29.880 --> 14:32.120]  I've seen people veg for 30, 45 days.
[14:32.120 --> 14:34.400]  I've also seen guys veg for 60 days.
[14:34.400 --> 14:36.600]  Some of the outdoor plants that people veg
[14:36.600 --> 14:40.400]  for the early start of the year before the outdoor season,
[14:40.400 --> 14:42.260]  I've seen people veg plants for four or five
[14:42.260 --> 14:44.360]  or six months to put them outside.
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.920]  So what's gonna happen is your plants
[14:45.920 --> 14:47.320]  are gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.680]  the longer you veg.
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.160]  So we're just gonna go for a short veg in this one.
[14:52.160 --> 14:53.640]  So your flowering phase,
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.440]  I'm gonna go for a nine week flowering phase.
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.040]  Most of the plants I work with are about nine to 10 weeks,
[14:59.800 --> 15:00.640]  nine weeks is a good number
[15:00.640 --> 15:02.480]  because that gives us three trimesters
[15:02.480 --> 15:04.260]  of three weeks each to talk about.
[15:04.260 --> 15:07.260]  I can talk about my theory of the trimesters on the plants.
[15:08.780 --> 15:10.060]  So yeah, that'll help us out.
[15:10.060 --> 15:13.440]  So we got 14 days in seedling, 63 days in flowering.
[15:13.440 --> 15:14.880]  Are you looking at 77 days there?
[15:14.880 --> 15:19.240]  That gives us about 30 days to veg and fix any problems.
[15:19.240 --> 15:24.240]  So let's just basically start a short grow from cedar clone.
[15:24.360 --> 15:26.680]  This is kind of the grow I'm gonna talk about now
[15:26.680 --> 15:28.760]  is basically the type of grow
[15:29.440 --> 15:31.760]  I would do if I were searching through a 10 pack of seeds
[15:31.760 --> 15:33.480]  to find the keepers in the pack.
[15:33.480 --> 15:36.400]  So for this, I would usually use like a three gallon pot
[15:36.400 --> 15:37.800]  or a five gallon pot.
[15:37.800 --> 15:40.120]  And I would use, I don't know, probably
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.600]  like between nine and 16,
[15:42.600 --> 15:44.480]  just depends on how small I'm gonna keep the plants
[15:44.480 --> 15:45.980]  and how tight I wanna cramp them in the space
[15:45.980 --> 15:46.820]  under the light.
[15:46.820 --> 15:47.680]  And this is just one light
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.480]  is all I'm talking about right now.
[15:49.480 --> 15:51.640]  So if we start from seeds or clones,
[15:51.640 --> 15:53.640]  the only difference will be the first two weeks really.
[15:53.640 --> 15:55.880]  Once the clones root and the seedlings take off,
[15:55.880 --> 15:57.520]  everything I'm talking about is gonna work
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.160]  the same for seeds and clones.
[15:59.160 --> 16:00.320]  If you're working with seeds,
[16:00.320 --> 16:02.440]  you'll have to be sure that you eliminate the males
[16:02.440 --> 16:03.680]  before we get too far into flower,
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.760]  but that's gonna be your major difference.
[16:06.960 --> 16:08.000]  So let's start with this.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.840]  I will say this is like, if we're starting day one,
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.180]  we'll say start day one right now.
[16:11.180 --> 16:13.320]  So today we would cut our clones
[16:13.320 --> 16:15.760]  and start germinating our seeds.
[16:15.760 --> 16:17.640]  I'm not gonna do any lessons on germinating seeds
[16:17.640 --> 16:19.160]  or cutting clones because I'm pretty sure
[16:19.160 --> 16:21.680]  I've covered that in past episodes.
[16:21.680 --> 16:23.360]  If you need to refresh your course,
[16:23.360 --> 16:24.200]  go back and listen to those.
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.480]  Or if you guys want a brand new episode on that, email me,
[16:28.320 --> 16:29.160]  and I will go back and listen to the old episode
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.800]  and I'll try to do an update for you.
[16:30.800 --> 16:32.880]  But only if enough people ask for it.
[16:32.880 --> 16:35.120]  That episode's out there, so it should work.
[16:35.120 --> 16:37.840]  So we cut our clones and we started our seeds for day one.
[16:37.840 --> 16:39.280]  This is where you wanna mark the date.
[16:39.280 --> 16:40.760]  Get out your grow calendar and mark it.
[16:40.760 --> 16:42.480]  Today is day one.
[16:42.480 --> 16:44.840]  For clones and seeds, I recommend a 24-hour light cycle,
[16:44.840 --> 16:46.880]  you guys, to start the first couple of weeks.
[16:46.880 --> 16:49.280]  The first few days are just a waiting game pretty much.
[16:49.280 --> 16:52.000]  If you're waiting for seeds, they'll pop up.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.200]  They'll pop up from whatever medium you've put them in
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.680]  in like 48 hours hopefully,
[16:55.680 --> 16:57.000]  or maybe it'll take them a couple days
[16:57.520 --> 16:58.360]  to start growing to the light.
[16:58.360 --> 17:00.440]  I suggest putting your seedlings into,
[17:00.440 --> 17:02.600]  I use beer cups, like Solo cups.
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.320]  Put your seedlings into the cups with a light potting mix
[17:07.320 --> 17:08.960]  with plenty of drainage and holes in the bottoms
[17:08.960 --> 17:10.280]  of the cups, of course.
[17:10.280 --> 17:12.760]  Once your seedlings have developed a nice taproot
[17:12.760 --> 17:14.400]  of like about an inch to three inches long,
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.680]  that's when you wanna throw those in your dirt.
[17:16.680 --> 17:18.200]  So clones will be lazy,
[17:18.200 --> 17:20.120]  but they'll root around 10 to 14 days.
[17:20.120 --> 17:21.560]  Some of you guys are gonna take a little longer
[17:21.560 --> 17:22.920]  to get your clones to root.
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.280]  It's all about a healthy mother plant,
[17:24.280 --> 17:26.440]  a good rooting environment.
[17:26.440 --> 17:27.320]  Be patient.
[17:27.320 --> 17:29.240]  And if it takes you more time to get your clones rooted,
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.880]  just plan that into your next run.
[17:30.880 --> 17:32.880]  Give yourself an extra week or an extra five days,
[17:32.880 --> 17:34.120]  whatever it takes.
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.360]  And then you'll start learning
[17:35.360 --> 17:36.640]  how to keep healthy your mother plants.
[17:36.640 --> 17:38.120]  You'll start learning how to clone better
[17:38.120 --> 17:39.360]  and you'll speed up your cloning time.
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.800]  It'll get better.
[17:40.800 --> 17:42.240]  Take a lot of extra clones at first
[17:42.240 --> 17:43.080]  because they're gonna die.
[17:43.080 --> 17:45.280]  If you're not good at cloning, if you're new at this,
[17:45.280 --> 17:47.920]  take extras because you will lose some
[17:47.920 --> 17:49.760]  and don't be sad about it.
[17:49.760 --> 17:52.200]  So after several days, let's see, where was I?
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.440]  The seedlings are gonna start growing tall and skinny
[17:54.440 --> 17:55.760]  in the first few days.
[17:55.880 --> 17:57.880]  After several days, they'll develop their first true leaves.
[17:57.880 --> 18:00.320]  By this time, the clones are rooted and ready for cups
[18:00.320 --> 18:01.800]  and the seedlings will be small plants
[18:01.800 --> 18:03.800]  and catching up to the clones.
[18:03.800 --> 18:05.000]  So I wouldn't feed the seedlings
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.760]  until about seven to 10 days in.
[18:06.760 --> 18:09.000]  And when you do feed them, focus on root inoculant
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.400]  and building a good root base for the plants.
[18:11.400 --> 18:14.520]  I like a worm casting tea or something like that.
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.360]  Maybe something like great white.
[18:16.360 --> 18:17.360]  You can use OGT.
[18:18.440 --> 18:20.880]  Something that focuses on root inoculants.
[18:20.880 --> 18:22.640]  You want a trichoderma.
[18:23.800 --> 18:25.280]  Yeah, you guys, hopefully you've caught on
[18:25.800 --> 18:26.800]  to what I'm talking about by now.
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.400]  We've talked a lot about root inoculant with Sean.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.840]  So I would feed the clones the same thing
[18:30.840 --> 18:32.400]  when you put those into cups.
[18:32.400 --> 18:35.040]  I definitely like to feed my clones and my seedlings
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.160]  a lot of root inoculants to get that soil funky
[18:38.160 --> 18:40.160]  and get the roots fat, fat.
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.480]  The better roots, the better the fruits
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.640]  is what I say all the time.
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.040]  So by now, I feel like we should be putting our clones
[18:47.040 --> 18:48.480]  into cups and starting week three
[18:48.480 --> 18:50.640]  if everything went correctly.
[18:50.640 --> 18:52.480]  We fed the plants once.
[18:52.480 --> 18:54.360]  This makes me feel like everything is one lesson now.
[18:54.360 --> 18:55.360]  Now that we've gotten to week three
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.120]  and the clones and the seedlings are caught up,
[18:57.120 --> 18:58.400]  I feel like there won't be much difference
[18:58.400 --> 18:59.880]  between the clone and the seedling.
[18:59.880 --> 19:01.960]  Clone and the seedling, that was hard to say.
[19:01.960 --> 19:03.320]  The seedlings may grow more quickly
[19:03.320 --> 19:04.880]  because they have what we call seed vigor,
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.280]  but that's not always the case if you have good clones.
[19:08.280 --> 19:10.200]  I've seen some clones outgrow seedlings before
[19:10.200 --> 19:12.040]  and it's been kind of surprising.
[19:12.040 --> 19:13.320]  So all we've done up to this point
[19:13.320 --> 19:15.640]  is pretty much plant our seeds and clones.
[19:15.640 --> 19:17.800]  We've gotten our starter plants into cups
[19:17.800 --> 19:20.680]  and we've fed them some worm tea or some root inoculant.
[19:20.680 --> 19:23.400]  Maybe some great white, maybe some OGT.
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.080]  Something like that to get them started.
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.280]  And now I'm gonna call this the beginning of veg.
[19:28.280 --> 19:30.240]  Some people may call it pre-veg
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.440]  because we haven't gone into our big pots yet,
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.640]  but I'm gonna call it veg starting now.
[19:35.640 --> 19:37.080]  Now that we've gotten out of the cloner,
[19:37.080 --> 19:39.280]  now that we're not little baby seedlings anymore,
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.320]  I'm gonna say we're into veg.
[19:41.320 --> 19:44.120]  So the veg state can last as long as you want.
[19:44.120 --> 19:45.760]  The longer you veg, like I said earlier,
[19:45.760 --> 19:48.200]  the larger your plants are gonna get.
[19:48.200 --> 19:51.360]  The veg phase is where we do 90% of the topping,
[19:51.360 --> 19:54.040]  training and pruning of your plants.
[19:54.040 --> 19:56.000]  We kind of did a lesson on topping and stuff like that,
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.760]  but I plan to do another episode
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.320]  all about improving your crops
[19:59.320 --> 20:01.360]  and improving your yields and things.
[20:01.360 --> 20:03.360]  So that'll come in handy.
[20:03.360 --> 20:06.360]  Also, your plants are gonna take up 90% of the nitrogen
[20:06.360 --> 20:08.080]  that they use through their entire lives
[20:08.080 --> 20:12.060]  during the vegetative phase of their plants.
[20:12.060 --> 20:13.760]  People tend to really overlook the veg phase
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.520]  and they focus only on the bloom phase
[20:15.520 --> 20:17.000]  because that's when you can see your buds,
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.520]  but the veg phase is just as important.
[20:20.520 --> 20:22.080]  And so is your veg space, you guys.
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.440]  A lot of people don't spend the time
[20:23.440 --> 20:25.200]  building a proper veg room,
[20:25.200 --> 20:26.800]  and it really would help you out.
[20:26.800 --> 20:28.960]  If you teach those kids how to run
[20:28.960 --> 20:30.200]  before you put them on the track,
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.120]  they'd be a lot better performing kid.
[20:32.120 --> 20:34.040]  So I feel like if we use each day
[20:34.040 --> 20:36.160]  as a chance to prepare the plants for bloom,
[20:36.160 --> 20:38.820]  our crop will look much better at harvest time.
[20:39.880 --> 20:41.640]  My veg phase for my example of this grow
[20:41.640 --> 20:43.040]  is gonna be short, you guys.
[20:43.920 --> 20:44.760]  Gosh, give me one second.
[20:44.760 --> 20:45.880]  I'm gonna press pause and take a drink.
[20:45.880 --> 20:47.000]  I'll probably take a dab while I'm there.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.600]  Excuse me for one second.
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.760]  All right, guys, I feel like we are
[20:49.760 --> 20:52.240]  at the beginning of veg is where I left off.
[20:52.240 --> 20:55.000]  So I like to feed my plants the first day of each week.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.680]  Mondays are usually my feeding day for my personal crops.
[20:57.680 --> 20:59.160]  For me, starting everything on a Monday
[20:59.160 --> 21:00.960]  helps me keep track of everything.
[21:00.960 --> 21:02.960]  So on the first day of veg,
[21:02.960 --> 21:05.120]  I would feed my plants a nice base nutrient,
[21:05.120 --> 21:08.080]  a light humic acid, some potassium silicates
[21:08.080 --> 21:10.080]  to build strong cell walls,
[21:10.080 --> 21:13.080]  and I would also keep focusing on root development.
[21:13.080 --> 21:14.920]  We shouldn't need any cow mag or anything like that
[21:14.920 --> 21:16.320]  for the first couple of weeks.
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.280]  Everything should be cool.
[21:17.280 --> 21:18.840]  So for the first couple of weeks,
[21:18.880 --> 21:20.280]  your plant should be cool in the cups,
[21:20.280 --> 21:21.480]  but we're gonna have to plant them
[21:21.480 --> 21:23.320]  into larger pots pretty soon.
[21:23.320 --> 21:25.280]  You don't wanna see them get root bound in those cups,
[21:25.280 --> 21:26.480]  and they'll also get tall and skinny.
[21:26.480 --> 21:28.000]  We want them to bush out a little bit.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.320]  So when we put them into a larger pot,
[21:29.320 --> 21:30.640]  they'll start bushing out.
[21:30.640 --> 21:33.200]  So it's also a good time to adjust your lights
[21:33.200 --> 21:36.240]  from 24 hours to an 18-6 schedule.
[21:36.240 --> 21:39.440]  You want them on for 18 hours, off for six.
[21:39.440 --> 21:40.440]  Plants like a rest period,
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.520]  and it's also gonna save you money on your energy bill.
[21:43.520 --> 21:45.360]  So now you've got your plants into cups.
[21:45.360 --> 21:46.720]  They're nice and healthy.
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.320]  They're starting to kind of grow a little bit.
[21:48.800 --> 21:50.240]  They've got nice roots.
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.960]  We're about three weeks in.
[21:51.960 --> 21:54.080]  I think by the fourth week is when we should start
[21:54.080 --> 21:56.800]  putting everything into larger pots.
[21:56.800 --> 21:58.040]  If we leave them in the cups too long,
[21:58.040 --> 21:58.880]  they're gonna get root bound.
[21:58.880 --> 22:00.240]  They're gonna start getting stretchy.
[22:00.240 --> 22:01.960]  And also, when you put them into bigger pots,
[22:01.960 --> 22:04.360]  they can go a little bit longer without needing water.
[22:04.360 --> 22:05.880]  So that'll help you out too.
[22:05.880 --> 22:07.640]  So if you're gonna veg for a couple extra weeks
[22:07.640 --> 22:10.800]  and you have time and space, go for bigger pots.
[22:10.800 --> 22:13.040]  For my example, we're just gonna do a quick crop,
[22:13.040 --> 22:14.520]  and we're gonna use three-gallon pots,
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.760]  and they'll be just fine.
[22:16.760 --> 22:18.720]  So carefully put everything from your cups
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.600]  into a three-gallon pot or a larger pot,
[22:20.600 --> 22:21.960]  whichever you're gonna use.
[22:22.840 --> 22:24.760]  And I think I've talked about transplanting.
[22:24.760 --> 22:26.320]  I think I've talked a little bit about doing that.
[22:26.320 --> 22:28.120]  So if you guys need help transplanting, let me know,
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.080]  and I'll talk more about that,
[22:29.080 --> 22:30.720]  but I'm pretty sure I've covered it.
[22:30.720 --> 22:33.960]  So carefully put everything into a larger pot and feed them.
[22:35.120 --> 22:37.460]  We should be about week four, maybe into week five by now.
[22:37.460 --> 22:38.760]  You guys, I hope you started doing these
[22:38.760 --> 22:40.600]  into pots around week four.
[22:40.600 --> 22:42.560]  I hope you didn't wait too long.
[22:42.560 --> 22:44.560]  So feed them, and you're gonna feed them
[22:44.560 --> 22:46.760]  a strong dose of root inoculant, of course.
[22:46.760 --> 22:48.160]  We're always gonna do that through veg,
[22:48.160 --> 22:50.360]  right up to kind of the start of flour.
[22:50.360 --> 22:52.040]  Feed them a veg-based nutrient.
[22:52.040 --> 22:54.840]  I use, if I'm using bottled nutrients for this,
[22:54.840 --> 22:58.560]  I would recommend Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Soil Formula,
[22:58.560 --> 23:00.240]  the Grow Formula.
[23:00.240 --> 23:01.160]  They don't pay me to say that.
[23:01.160 --> 23:02.440]  It's just what I use.
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.060]  I would use some humic acid in there for this grow.
[23:06.060 --> 23:08.120]  For my recommendation, if you're using bottles,
[23:08.120 --> 23:10.500]  I would say Liquid Karma from Botanicare.
[23:10.500 --> 23:11.760]  I would use a fulvic acid,
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.460]  which Organicare sells a liquid fulvic acid
[23:15.360 --> 23:16.820]  that works great for this.
[23:16.820 --> 23:18.700]  I would use some CalMag at this point, you guys.
[23:18.700 --> 23:21.300]  You're going to start needing some CalMag in there.
[23:21.300 --> 23:23.300]  A very light dose of CalMag to start
[23:23.300 --> 23:27.060]  because your babies aren't ready for it just yet, possibly,
[23:27.060 --> 23:28.140]  and I don't want you to burn them.
[23:28.140 --> 23:31.380]  So be careful with that CalMag, but it's about to be time.
[23:31.380 --> 23:33.940]  I would also recommend something to feed the microbes,
[23:33.940 --> 23:37.260]  basic molasses or something like Humboldt Honey
[23:37.260 --> 23:38.820]  or something like that.
[23:38.820 --> 23:40.580]  Hybri would be good.
[23:40.580 --> 23:44.100]  Anything like that with a lot of molasses-y type stuff there.
[23:44.900 --> 23:46.620]  Now our plants are in their final pots.
[23:46.620 --> 23:47.660]  They've been fed.
[23:47.660 --> 23:49.580]  These plants can be topped or super cropped
[23:49.580 --> 23:51.260]  or manipulated into a screen of green
[23:51.260 --> 23:53.340]  or whatever you have planned for them.
[23:53.340 --> 23:54.780]  Just make sure that if you're going to do
[23:54.780 --> 23:56.980]  any topping or pruning,
[23:56.980 --> 23:58.820]  do that about 10 to 14 days
[23:58.820 --> 24:00.740]  before you start flowering the plants.
[24:00.740 --> 24:02.800]  Your plants need a little bit of time to recover
[24:02.800 --> 24:04.340]  after you've topped them.
[24:04.340 --> 24:06.860]  Plants are apical dominant, which means they want to top.
[24:06.860 --> 24:08.040]  So after you've cut the tops,
[24:08.040 --> 24:10.380]  the hormones have to move around.
[24:10.380 --> 24:11.540]  It's got to move hormones around.
[24:11.540 --> 24:12.840]  You want those hormones built up
[24:12.840 --> 24:15.200]  in the tips of your plants before you flower them.
[24:15.200 --> 24:16.400]  It's really helpful for your plants.
[24:16.400 --> 24:18.800]  If you start topping stuff and pruning things
[24:18.800 --> 24:19.640]  and then flower right away,
[24:19.640 --> 24:20.880]  you're just going to make little tiny buds
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.480]  and confuse the shit out of your plant.
[24:22.480 --> 24:24.240]  You'll be disappointed.
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.960]  So now that we are in our bigger pots and we fed everything,
[24:27.960 --> 24:30.240]  I'm going to say we are in full veg mode.
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.840]  We have our plants in the finishing pots.
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.360]  Things have been topped and super cropped.
[24:33.360 --> 24:35.760]  We've got our lights on a veg schedule of 18 on
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.120]  and six hours off.
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.320]  We should be feeding a solid veg recipe
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.560]  at the start of every week
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.440]  and watching for any signs of bug problems.
[24:43.440 --> 24:45.600]  It'd be a good idea to start a bug prevention regimen
[24:45.600 --> 24:47.820]  by now if you haven't already started spraying
[24:47.820 --> 24:50.240]  or doing something to keep the mites away.
[24:50.240 --> 24:52.120]  Neem oil is a great way to prevent bugs
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.200]  while you're in veg,
[24:53.200 --> 24:57.140]  but do not ever spray a flowering plant with neem oil.
[24:57.140 --> 24:59.400]  One application of neem oil on a flowering plant
[24:59.400 --> 25:00.800]  will ruin the entire thing.
[25:00.800 --> 25:02.720]  The flavor will be miserable.
[25:02.720 --> 25:05.560]  If you make extracts, they will taste like neem oil.
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.320]  Just please don't do that, you guys.
[25:07.320 --> 25:09.920]  Don't spray anything on your flowering plants.
[25:09.920 --> 25:12.440]  Any bug sprays or anything on your flowering plants.
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.720]  If you're gonna spray stuff on flowering plants,
[25:14.720 --> 25:18.400]  make sure it's a well, well thought out foliar feed.
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.240]  Please.
[25:21.600 --> 25:23.480]  Yeah, I think I can write a whole separate rant
[25:23.480 --> 25:25.520]  on pest management in another episode.
[25:25.520 --> 25:28.000]  I said that we should feed on Monday of every week.
[25:28.000 --> 25:28.840]  That's my opinion.
[25:28.840 --> 25:29.980]  I like to feed on Monday.
[25:29.980 --> 25:31.600]  I mix up nutrients.
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.000]  I mix up a nice reservoir of nutrients and feed the plants.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.640]  Every Monday, they get a nice healthy feed.
[25:37.640 --> 25:39.520]  And then usually by Wednesday or Thursday,
[25:39.520 --> 25:41.720]  they need more, they need a water.
[25:41.720 --> 25:44.420]  So I'll just feed them clean pH balanced water
[25:44.420 --> 25:46.000]  with no nutrients in it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.280]  I'll just feed them that.
[25:47.280 --> 25:50.760]  And then on Monday again, I will give them nutrients.
[25:50.760 --> 25:52.320]  And then the next time that they're thirsty,
[25:52.320 --> 25:54.320]  probably that next Wednesday or Thursday,
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.140]  they will get a fully organic worm tea
[25:57.140 --> 25:59.720]  that I have brewed for like 36 hours.
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.120]  I'll put worm castings in there.
[26:01.120 --> 26:02.800]  I'll put Grokashi in there.
[26:02.800 --> 26:06.280]  I'll put a little bit of Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
[26:06.280 --> 26:07.680]  the lush roots in there.
[26:07.680 --> 26:09.280]  Put a little bit of fish hydroslate.
[26:10.040 --> 26:10.880]  I'll put some sea crop.
[26:11.840 --> 26:13.000]  And then I'll feed my plants that.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.960]  And they get fed teas probably twice in veg
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.480]  and probably three times during the flower phase.
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.440]  And I think it makes a huge difference
[26:20.440 --> 26:22.260]  because I make a pretty awesome tea
[26:22.260 --> 26:24.080]  that Sean taught me how to make.
[26:24.080 --> 26:25.160]  I really think it makes a difference.
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.360]  So that's kind of my feeding idea.
[26:27.360 --> 26:28.940]  I don't think I've ever broken down
[26:28.940 --> 26:31.080]  my week to week feeding schedule.
[26:31.080 --> 26:33.440]  I don't want to be responsible for your weekly feeding.
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.000]  I kind of want to let you experiment
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  and find what works for you.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.240]  But if you've got questions about specific nutrients,
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.400]  let me know and I'll do my best to figure out
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.280]  how to incorporate that into your grow for you.
[26:44.280 --> 26:46.040]  That's gonna take a lot of work.
[26:46.040 --> 26:46.960]  So like I was saying earlier,
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.200]  we can veg as long as we want.
[26:48.200 --> 26:50.960]  For my example, we're gonna veg for about 30 days.
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.320]  You can top and manipulate the plants
[26:52.320 --> 26:53.880]  as much as you want while in veg.
[26:53.880 --> 26:54.720]  Did I already read this?
[26:54.720 --> 26:56.960]  No, but I would stop topping about,
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.840]  I would stop topping about two weeks before flowering.
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.640]  My short crops don't really get much
[27:01.640 --> 27:02.640]  topping and pruning, you guys.
[27:02.640 --> 27:03.800]  If I'm running a seed crop
[27:03.800 --> 27:05.640]  and I want to see what the seedlings are,
[27:05.640 --> 27:07.480]  I really don't top much.
[27:07.480 --> 27:08.800]  I take two clones from each plant
[27:09.320 --> 27:10.240]  just before I flower it.
[27:10.240 --> 27:12.640]  I clean up the bottoms just a little bit.
[27:12.640 --> 27:14.080]  And then once I flower,
[27:14.080 --> 27:15.640]  I clean up the bottoms once I flower,
[27:15.640 --> 27:18.120]  but my small crops really don't get much topping or pruning.
[27:18.120 --> 27:20.040]  I try to let the, get the test crops
[27:20.040 --> 27:22.680]  just in and out quickly so I can see what I'm working with.
[27:22.680 --> 27:24.720]  Because if I've got a bunch of boys in there
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.560]  or if I don't see the traits I'm looking for,
[27:26.560 --> 27:27.840]  then I just want to get that out of there
[27:27.840 --> 27:29.160]  and scrap it as soon as possible.
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.800]  I'm looking for specific traits at this point.
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.960]  So the next 30 days while we're in veg,
[27:34.960 --> 27:36.800]  basically we need to watch for bugs,
[27:36.800 --> 27:37.960]  watch for problems,
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.000]  and keep the plants as healthy and happy as possible.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.720]  So I suggest checking each plant every single day.
[27:44.720 --> 27:45.920]  I know that sounds ridiculous,
[27:45.920 --> 27:47.360]  but however many plants you've got,
[27:47.360 --> 27:48.480]  you should be in there,
[27:48.480 --> 27:50.800]  you should touch every plant every single day.
[27:50.800 --> 27:52.440]  That's how you know you're growing from your heart.
[27:52.440 --> 27:54.840]  That's how you know you've got solid medicine
[27:54.840 --> 27:57.160]  that doesn't need to be sprayed with Eagle 20.
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.040]  That's how you know that if you do see a problem,
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.200]  you'll be on top of it and you'll be able to cure it.
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.600]  You'll be able to solve the problem
[28:02.600 --> 28:04.360]  before it gets out of control.
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.040]  That's super important being a good gardener.
[28:07.040 --> 28:08.960]  So I suggest checking each day
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.920]  and make notes of what you see.
[28:10.920 --> 28:12.840]  If you see anything that stands out to you,
[28:12.840 --> 28:13.680]  make a note of it.
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.400]  If it's good, if it's bad, if it's weird,
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.040]  if you're not sure, if it's new, if it's questionable,
[28:18.040 --> 28:21.600]  make a note and don't forget
[28:21.600 --> 28:22.920]  because I know you're gonna say,
[28:22.920 --> 28:25.080]  I'll remember shit, the notes are in my head.
[28:25.080 --> 28:27.880]  Dude, we're potheads, we're pot growers, we're dabbers.
[28:27.880 --> 28:28.880]  You're gonna forget.
[28:28.880 --> 28:30.960]  You're gonna forget something, write it down.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.080]  And when maybe one day you're gonna want to run a business
[28:34.800 --> 28:36.160]  and the guy with the notes will get the opportunity
[28:36.160 --> 28:37.160]  to run a business over the guy
[28:37.160 --> 28:38.800]  with a head full of bullshit and ideas.
[28:38.800 --> 28:39.760]  You've written something down
[28:39.760 --> 28:40.840]  that shows you've done something.
[28:40.840 --> 28:43.240]  The other guy's like, I remember doing this.
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.480]  The people that are hiring you to be their master grower
[28:45.480 --> 28:47.080]  at their dispensary don't want your hopes
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.080]  and dreams in your head, they wanna see it on paper.
[28:49.080 --> 28:51.440]  If you take notes, you got something that's documented.
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.240]  And now that it's legal, you don't have to worry about it.
[28:53.240 --> 28:55.600]  I understand you old school growers didn't want any notes.
[28:55.600 --> 28:56.680]  I get it, but now you can.
[28:56.680 --> 28:59.560]  So set a date for your flowering cycle
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.200]  is what I think you should do.
[29:01.200 --> 29:02.520]  Decide how long you wanna veg,
[29:02.520 --> 29:04.640]  set a date for your flowering cycle,
[29:04.640 --> 29:07.640]  and then commit to that and veg for that long.
[29:07.640 --> 29:10.400]  Get your plants trimmed up, get them pruned, get them topped.
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.960]  If you're gonna put them in a screen of green
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.360]  like Spence taught us about, put them in the screen of green
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.920]  and get them nice and happy.
[29:16.920 --> 29:19.920]  And then we'll get them ready for the flowering cycle.
[29:19.920 --> 29:23.960]  I've gone for 30 minutes and I don't think I can get
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.200]  enough of the flowering cycle to make it worth your listen
[29:27.200 --> 29:29.080]  in to this episode.
[29:29.080 --> 29:31.640]  So I think we're just gonna start wrapping up the show
[29:31.640 --> 29:32.480]  at 30 minutes.
[29:33.320 --> 29:34.160]  I think you guys really listen a lot
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.120]  when I put out shorter episodes.
[29:35.120 --> 29:37.840]  You don't seem to get the attention deficit disorder.
[29:37.840 --> 29:39.320]  So we're just gonna do a short episode here.
[29:39.320 --> 29:40.600]  I appreciate you guys for listening.
[29:40.600 --> 29:44.600]  I will come back in a week and I will have a solid lesson
[29:44.600 --> 29:47.120]  about the flowering schedule for you.
[29:47.120 --> 29:49.200]  I hope to get Spence on an upcoming episode.
[29:49.200 --> 29:51.560]  I was talking to Sean and he'll be back in the future.
[29:51.560 --> 29:52.520]  I've got an episode coming up
[29:52.520 --> 29:54.200]  about how to improve your garden.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.440]  I've got a lot of things planned, you guys.
[29:55.440 --> 29:56.680]  I'm really getting back on my game.
[29:56.680 --> 29:58.800]  So I'm getting more lessons written down,
[29:58.800 --> 29:59.960]  getting more episodes planned.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.520]  I appreciate you sticking through my rough patch there
[30:02.520 --> 30:04.480]  while I had to do some sloppy episodes.
[30:05.840 --> 30:08.520]  Big thanks to everybody who sent me well wishes
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.720]  on taking care of my head, wishing me better on my head.
[30:10.720 --> 30:12.120]  I feel much better.
[30:12.120 --> 30:14.600]  I'd like to say I'm about, I kept saying I was 90%,
[30:14.600 --> 30:15.960]  you know, I'm about 85% back.
[30:15.960 --> 30:19.320]  I keep noticing, sometimes I'll say the wrong word
[30:19.320 --> 30:20.160]  in a sentence.
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.920]  The other day I told somebody that I was going to
[30:22.920 --> 30:26.320]  eat this banana and I was actually holding a burrito
[30:26.320 --> 30:29.000]  and I didn't even realize that I kept saying banana,
[30:29.040 --> 30:31.040]  but it was a burrito and they corrected me and I said,
[30:31.040 --> 30:32.440]  yeah, this banana is tasty.
[30:32.440 --> 30:34.440]  And they're like, it's a fucking burrito, dude.
[30:34.440 --> 30:36.000]  So I realized I was doing that.
[30:37.280 --> 30:40.240]  I was describing something that was purple
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.760]  and I called it orange and I know I did that, but I don't.
[30:44.760 --> 30:46.600]  Yeah, so there's stuff like that that's going on in my head
[30:46.600 --> 30:48.120]  that's still a little bit goofy.
[30:48.120 --> 30:49.800]  And sometimes I forget my password still
[30:49.800 --> 30:51.040]  when I try to log into my computer,
[30:51.040 --> 30:52.520]  but I'm getting it back together.
[30:52.520 --> 30:54.280]  So I do appreciate you guys sticking with me through that.
[30:54.280 --> 30:55.840]  It's been a really scary time,
[30:55.840 --> 30:57.880]  but I feel like I'm coming back together.
[30:57.880 --> 30:59.560]  So let's wrap up the show guys.
[30:59.560 --> 31:01.000]  I'm fucking rambly today.
[31:02.920 --> 31:04.240]  Where is that part that I read?
[31:04.240 --> 31:05.880]  Oh yeah, it says, thanks for listening to another episode.
[31:05.880 --> 31:07.400]  I'll be back in another week.
[31:07.400 --> 31:08.640]  Don't forget to check out the sponsors.
[31:08.640 --> 31:11.400]  I didn't do much ads because I wanted to get the show going.

[31:57.760 --> 31:58.600]  I could use a new microphone.
[31:58.600 --> 31:59.720]  I could use these microphone covers.
[31:59.720 --> 32:01.040]  This one's all grimy.
[32:01.920 --> 32:03.120]  Yeah, no begging.
[32:03.120 --> 32:06.400]  Just if it's something on your mind, I would appreciate it.
[32:06.400 --> 32:07.920]  We are on all the social media sites.
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.760]  Just search for us.
[32:08.760 --> 32:09.920]  It's growfromyourheart.
[32:09.920 --> 32:12.360]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[32:12.360 --> 32:13.960]  You can find me on Facebook.
[32:13.960 --> 32:16.160]  Please, you guys, follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[32:16.160 --> 32:19.360]  I post a lot of sweet cannabis photography there.
[32:19.360 --> 32:22.760]  I've recently joined, what's it called, Mass Roots,
[32:22.760 --> 32:24.240]  but I'm not getting much response,
[32:24.240 --> 32:26.600]  so I may quit posting there eventually,
[32:26.960 --> 32:28.640]  but definitely check me out on Instagram.
[32:28.640 --> 32:30.040]  You guys, huge shout out to my ninja spence.
[32:30.040 --> 32:31.000]  Thanks again for listening.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.800]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[32:32.800 --> 32:34.360]  and give your mom a hug for me.
