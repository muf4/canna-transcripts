[00:00.830 --> 00:20.320]  All right, here we go.
[00:20.320 --> 00:22.000]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  I'm your host.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.760]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.760 --> 00:29.920]  This is episode 702 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.920 --> 00:32.800]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of quick emails.

[01:45.760 --> 01:48.880]  to make that nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:48.880 --> 01:51.080]  Once again, thank you for the Patreon support.
[01:51.080 --> 01:56.080]  Oh, I am so excited that the holiday shenanigans are over.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.520]  I am done with the Christmas rush.
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.560]  I'm done hearing Christmas music everywhere I go.
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.160]  I'm done with the traffic.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.560]  My favorite part about Christmas, I love the family.
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.720]  I got to spend time with my two favorite people, my mama and my daughter at the same time.
[02:07.720 --> 02:08.720]  They live a distance apart.
[02:08.720 --> 02:11.400]  It was great to have spent time with both of them.
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.440]  My favorite part though might be other than the family, the part about outside there is
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.440]  the Christmas lights.
[02:16.440 --> 02:17.440]  I do enjoy the Christmas lights.
[02:17.440 --> 02:21.200]  That's kind of cool, but everything else other than the family and the Christmas lights,
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.600]  I'm glad it's over.
[02:22.600 --> 02:26.360]  I'm glad that it's a year away until we have to do that crap again.
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.640]  It is time to settle in.
[02:27.640 --> 02:28.640]  I'm glad.
[02:28.640 --> 02:29.840]  I hope you had a good time is where I'm headed.
[02:29.840 --> 02:31.080]  I hope you had a great Christmas.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.320]  I'm glad that crap is over.
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.920]  It's time to settle in, get back to business, get back to work, get back to normal schedules,
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.400]  less of the hustle and bustle for the Christmas holiday stuff.
[02:40.400 --> 02:41.600]  I hope you had a wonderful time.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.720]  I hope you got to spend time with your family, whoever it is.
[02:44.720 --> 02:48.920]  Like I said in the last episode, if it's not your blood family, maybe it's your ganja family.
[02:48.920 --> 02:51.000]  Maybe it's your other kind of family, whatever you're into.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  I hope you had a good time.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.120]  Hope you got to spend it with some people.
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.400]  If not, join us on the discord.
[02:55.400 --> 02:56.960]  You've always got a family there.
[02:56.960 --> 03:00.640]  The discord link is in the show notes and the video description.
[03:00.640 --> 03:02.560]  I'm obviously nice and rambly.
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.160]  You guys, I was hanging out on discord earlier, taking dabs with the friends.
[03:06.160 --> 03:09.280]  I think I smoked some stuff called a rainbow cheddar.
[03:09.280 --> 03:11.360]  I don't have the jar with me or I would show you.
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.360]  Got me well lit, well medicated, nice and talkative.
[03:14.360 --> 03:16.760]  So this will be a fun podcast.
[03:16.760 --> 03:18.200]  I don't want to stretch it out too far.
[03:18.200 --> 03:20.960]  I want to wish everybody a good holiday, good, safe, happy new year.
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.440]  That will be the next holiday.
[03:22.440 --> 03:24.960]  Then we settle in with a fresh start.
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.880]  Let's get into an email because I do want to answer at least one, maybe two emails here
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.320]  in this short one camera episode.
[03:31.320 --> 03:34.200]  Yes, we're only recording with one camera today.
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.880]  Still trying to figure out a tech issue.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.880]  We'll get it figured out.
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.240]  You guys aren't concerned with that.
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.240]  I do apologize.
[03:39.240 --> 03:40.240]  It's only one camera.
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.440]  I tried to deliver a two camera show.
[03:42.440 --> 03:43.440]  Let's get to this message.
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.720]  It comes from our friend who calls themselves, they did not even sign it.
[03:47.720 --> 03:49.000]  There's no name.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.760]  This one comes from Anonymous.
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.760]  Anonymous says, hello, Irie.
[03:53.920 --> 03:58.720]  Unfortunately, my last paper towel and seeds went dry for a few hours.
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.320]  I sprayed them around six and found them dry around two.
[04:02.320 --> 04:05.080]  The tap roots generally still seem healthy.
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.440]  Then the question, let me kind of talk about what happened here.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.480]  Our friend is germinating some seeds.
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.120]  They're attempting the fold up a paper towel and stick your seeds in their method.
[04:14.120 --> 04:15.920]  Put some water in it, keep it moist.
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.360]  Those seeds should sprout.
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.000]  Unfortunately, our friend got stoned, got tied up in a video game, got distracted.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  I don't know what happened.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  I'm making shit up.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.560]  They got distracted and those seedlings went dry.
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.600]  The question is, should I start over or will these plants be stunted in the future and
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.220]  or offer less yield, less ideal plants to breed and clone in the long run, or will they
[04:36.220 --> 04:39.200]  somehow recover and be worth keeping?
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  Thank you, Irie.
[04:40.200 --> 04:42.480]  Uh, this is a pretty good question.
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.720]  I don't have any scientific input or evidence based on what I'm going to support, what I'm
[04:47.720 --> 04:48.960]  going to say.
[04:48.960 --> 04:54.520]  This is just what I think and what I've experienced and how I think that, uh, the, the will to
[04:54.520 --> 04:58.920]  survive, excuse me, if you heard me get all choked up talking about the will to survive
[04:58.920 --> 05:01.720]  and life must go on, it got me all choked up there.
[05:01.720 --> 05:06.900]  So, uh, you say that the tap roots generally still seem healthy.
[05:06.900 --> 05:09.660]  Your concern here is, should I start over?
[05:09.660 --> 05:10.880]  Will these plants be stunted?
[05:10.880 --> 05:13.760]  Uh, will these plants not offer what they could have?
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.260]  Um, I don't think you, if they keep growing, if they survive, I don't think you cause them
[05:18.260 --> 05:19.260]  any problems.
[05:19.260 --> 05:20.260]  I think they will recover.
[05:20.260 --> 05:21.620]  I think they'll bounce back.
[05:21.620 --> 05:23.660]  They will give you their full potential.
[05:23.660 --> 05:25.500]  Possibly they may be a little bit stronger.
[05:25.500 --> 05:29.540]  I think anything that goes through a little bit of a struggle, a little bit of adversity
[05:29.540 --> 05:32.700]  and survives, it comes out stronger, better.
[05:32.700 --> 05:35.780]  I think the phrase is what doesn't kill me only makes me stronger.
[05:35.780 --> 05:38.340]  I think you may have done that to these plants.
[05:38.340 --> 05:42.220]  If they didn't die during your little drought period, if they didn't go too dry, they're
[05:42.220 --> 05:43.220]  fine.
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.340]  They're going to be a great plants.
[05:44.340 --> 05:45.460]  I would not start over.
[05:45.460 --> 05:46.900]  I would keep growing these.
[05:46.940 --> 05:52.900]  I would proceed as usual, business as usual on with the regularly scheduled program.
[05:52.900 --> 05:55.660]  I think you're going to get good, viable, usable plants.
[05:55.660 --> 05:58.540]  They will live up to their potential, their full outcome.
[05:58.540 --> 06:01.500]  You can clone, breed, keep a mother plant.
[06:01.500 --> 06:02.980]  I think you're going to do great.
[06:02.980 --> 06:06.300]  So nothing to worry about there as long as you keep them going, as long as they're still
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.460]  healthy, as long as they look happy.
[06:08.460 --> 06:14.020]  If they do give you any problems, once you get them past that tiny, delicate seedling
[06:14.020 --> 06:17.940]  stage, if you do have any problems, don't blame it on yourself for this issue.
[06:17.940 --> 06:19.180]  You do have to get them past this.
[06:19.180 --> 06:20.180]  They've got to recover.
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.660]  They've got to get cotyledons and turn into plants.
[06:22.660 --> 06:26.740]  If you have any issues after the cotyledons form and they're actually plants, that is
[06:26.740 --> 06:28.460]  not from this.
[06:28.460 --> 06:32.700]  So don't use this as like a reason later.
[06:32.700 --> 06:36.860]  This isn't the sprained ankle in training camp is not why you lost the fight six weeks
[06:36.860 --> 06:37.860]  later.
[06:37.860 --> 06:38.860]  Don't blame this.
[06:38.860 --> 06:39.860]  This isn't why.
[06:39.860 --> 06:41.020]  So if you do run into trouble, it wasn't from this.
[06:41.020 --> 06:42.420]  I think you will have success.
[06:42.420 --> 06:46.300]  I've rambled on more than enough about this episode or about this question.
[06:46.300 --> 06:48.060]  Anonymous, thank you for the great question.
[06:48.060 --> 06:49.060]  I hope I helped you out.
[06:49.060 --> 06:50.540]  I hope you keep those seedlings going.
[06:50.540 --> 06:51.540]  I hope they look good.
[06:51.540 --> 06:52.540]  Hope they're healthy.
[06:52.540 --> 06:57.220]  Uh, if they're anything from my line, I hope to see pictures of the kids as they grow up.
[06:57.220 --> 07:00.660]  I do enjoy, uh, people usually send me a lot of flower picks.
[07:00.660 --> 07:04.500]  I get big chunky bud shots, trichome shots, love all that shit.
[07:04.500 --> 07:08.500]  Also I do appreciate a veg picks, clone flower seed.
[07:08.500 --> 07:09.540]  I love the whole stage.
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.540]  Let me see your stuff.
[07:10.540 --> 07:13.940]  Uh, especially if there's something weird or interesting happening in your grow.
[07:13.940 --> 07:14.940]  I like baby pictures.
[07:14.940 --> 07:15.940]  I like adult pictures.
[07:15.940 --> 07:17.580]  That sounds weird when you say it like that.
[07:17.580 --> 07:18.980]  Uh, baby pictures of my kids.
[07:18.980 --> 07:19.980]  I like that.
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.580]  My seedlings, I want to see them in all stages.
[07:21.580 --> 07:26.460]  You guys, let's get my high ass back on track because obviously I'm rambling up a fucking
[07:26.460 --> 07:27.940]  storm over here.
[07:27.940 --> 07:28.940]  Let's focus.
[07:28.940 --> 07:33.500]  This message comes from our friend as I, am I supposed to say your name?
[07:33.500 --> 07:36.780]  Um, this one comes from our friend Dave in Ontario.
[07:36.780 --> 07:40.300]  I'm going to cut out part of the details, but big up to our buddy Dave in Ontario.
[07:40.300 --> 07:41.900]  Thank you for the great question.
[07:41.900 --> 07:43.780]  It goes a little bit like this.
[07:43.780 --> 07:45.380]  It says Rasta Jeff.
[07:45.380 --> 07:47.220]  It's your friend Dave from Ontario.
[07:47.220 --> 07:51.940]  Uh, it says you and I both have brain injuries, which may be why I'm so rambly today.
[07:51.940 --> 07:55.780]  Uh, it says I love, we both love growing cannabis and we love comedians, bro.
[07:55.780 --> 07:56.780]  We could be friends.
[07:56.780 --> 07:58.420]  Did we just become best friends?
[07:58.420 --> 08:00.840]  We grow weed, we got brain injuries and we like comedians.
[08:00.840 --> 08:02.280]  We could get along.
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.280]  We could work well on a car trip together.
[08:04.280 --> 08:06.520]  It says you are a cannabis hero.
[08:06.520 --> 08:11.400]  Um, I'm not going to argue if you think I'm your hero, but I in no way consider myself,
[08:11.400 --> 08:16.180]  think of myself as a hero that felt weird to read, but I can't belittle or discredit
[08:16.180 --> 08:17.180]  your label.
[08:17.180 --> 08:18.600]  So I am a fucking hero.
[08:18.600 --> 08:19.600]  Thank you, bro.
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.600]  I appreciate that.
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.820]  It says as well as a general hero to me, uh, I will definitely take credit if you call
[08:24.820 --> 08:26.680]  me a hero, I've got to be your hero.
[08:26.680 --> 08:28.540]  Be disrespectful not to take it.
[08:28.540 --> 08:33.160]  It says I was that guy talking about a Doug Stanhope strain one time.
[08:33.420 --> 08:34.420]  Uh, that's funny.
[08:34.420 --> 08:37.840]  In my Instagram lives, we chat about strain names and random chaos.
[08:37.840 --> 08:42.240]  I like to name strains after, uh, people that inspire me, things that make my life better.
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.440]  Uh, things that just are great.
[08:44.440 --> 08:47.600]  And I named strains after Tom Segura and Bert Chrysler.
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.300]  Uh, Bert Chrysler, Brent Chrysler.
[08:50.300 --> 08:51.300]  How do you say it?
[08:51.300 --> 08:52.300]  Bert Chrysler.
[08:52.300 --> 08:53.300]  That's the guy's name.
[08:53.300 --> 08:54.300]  I made strains after those guys.
[08:54.300 --> 08:59.200]  Uh, the Saka Souffle and the machine are named after those two, uh, Tom Segura and Bert Chrysler.
[08:59.200 --> 09:02.860]  And we were joking that there should be a Doug Stanhope name.
[09:02.860 --> 09:06.140]  And uh, I can't come up with a strain name for Doug Stanhope, but that'd be funny.
[09:06.140 --> 09:09.160]  Cause Doug Stanhope is one of my favorite comedians.
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.160]  He is great.
[09:10.160 --> 09:14.200]  I got to see him at the Oriental theater here just a couple of months ago.
[09:14.200 --> 09:15.900]  Honestly, frustrated myself.
[09:15.900 --> 09:18.600]  I caught myself too high and zoning out during the show.
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.360]  I took a vape pen into that show cause it was a theater show and I was hitting the pen.
[09:23.360 --> 09:25.200]  The opening act wasn't my favorite.
[09:25.200 --> 09:27.560]  No disrespect to, uh, I won't even say his name.
[09:27.560 --> 09:30.840]  The opener was boring and I was just hitting my pen to pass time.
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.720]  And by the time Doug came out, I was way too high for a comedy show.
[09:33.720 --> 09:36.080]  Uh, so I missed, I feel like I missed part of it.
[09:36.080 --> 09:38.000]  I realized this, I was like, you're zoning out.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.800]  You're looking around at the crowd and like paying attention to the wrong shit.
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.960]  I had to lock myself in and pay attention to Stanhope, but he was great.
[09:43.960 --> 09:47.320]  I did enjoy it once I kind of, uh, snapped out of my coma.
[09:47.320 --> 09:48.960]  But uh, Doug Stanhope is fucking awesome.
[09:48.960 --> 09:51.440]  If you guys haven't heard digging up mother, listen to that bit.
[09:51.440 --> 09:52.440]  It's a comedy bit.
[09:52.440 --> 09:53.440]  Um, it's dark, it's dark.
[09:53.440 --> 09:56.080]  So I hope you're into dark comedy.
[09:56.080 --> 09:58.480]  Anyway, Doug Stanhope strain name would be great.
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.480]  I digress.
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.600]  This message says, anyway, I have a couple of your strains in my veg tent from seed.
[10:03.600 --> 10:08.040]  I've got sun kiss and Raphael there about four to five weeks old.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.120]  That's good info.
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.560]  It says, I want to determine the sex of my son kiss.
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.920]  So I turned my veg tent to 1212 to get the plant to show sex.
[10:16.920 --> 10:20.840]  So in five to 10 days, I expect to see signs of it being male or female.
[10:20.840 --> 10:21.840]  That will work.
[10:21.840 --> 10:23.480]  That's going to do what you're thinking it's going to do.
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.320]  It says, now my question is how long do I have to run or how long do I have to run 18
[10:29.320 --> 10:34.520]  six again before determining the sex of the plant after determining the sex of the plant?
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.880]  Sorry, I misread part of that, but it sounded kind of weird.
[10:36.880 --> 10:38.200]  It was my fault, not yours.
[10:38.200 --> 10:40.040]  So then he does follow that up with an example.
[10:40.040 --> 10:46.040]  It says my example, uh, day one, I switched from 18 six to 1212 day 55.
[10:46.040 --> 10:48.080]  I determined sun kisses a female.
[10:48.080 --> 10:51.280]  So I switched from 1212 back to 18 six.
[10:51.280 --> 10:57.960]  Now, what day would sun kiss be safe to go back to 1212 and go through its normal flowering
[10:57.960 --> 10:59.320]  cycle?
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.120]  That is a very good question.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.280]  Um, I like the idea.
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.640]  I like the strategy.
[11:04.640 --> 11:05.960]  I like the approach.
[11:05.960 --> 11:09.840]  However, I would have done this a little bit differently.
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.520]  I would have put these plants into flower when they were a few inches tall.
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.880]  I would not have done this at what are we 45 days in now the hormones in those plants
[11:20.880 --> 11:23.920]  have spread and developed so much more.
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.320]  And when you put it into flower, those hormones are going to take a little bit longer to switch
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.560]  over to flower to show you that the plant is in flower.
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.880]  Depending on it may, it may be, uh, may have reached a sexual point in its growth that
[11:34.880 --> 11:36.400]  it could have some pre flower into it.
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.960]  It may be ready, which also could be a problem, uh, because then it's not going to want to
[11:40.960 --> 11:43.240]  go back to veg as quickly.
[11:43.240 --> 11:44.960]  So I would have done it much earlier.
[11:44.960 --> 11:48.720]  Your plants are 45 days in when you put them into flower, it is going to take you that
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.120]  10 to 12 day period to find out if you've got a male or female, then you can put it
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.000]  back into veg, but it's going to take a little bit longer because you've got a plant with
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.240]  much more hormones, much more stuff to work with that you've got to return all the way
[12:01.240 --> 12:02.480]  back to veg.
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.120]  I would give it two, three, at least three, maybe four weeks to veg before I went back
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.280]  into flower.
[12:08.280 --> 12:11.680]  At this point, you're going to have a big ass plant.
[12:11.680 --> 12:14.980]  What I would have done, and I'm not saying you can't do your method.
[12:14.980 --> 12:20.540]  You can do this, but it's going to be slightly stressful on the plant and on you.
[12:20.540 --> 12:25.020]  What I would have done, what would have been better next time, which you can do is either
[12:25.020 --> 12:28.220]  flip these plants when they are much, much smaller.
[12:28.220 --> 12:33.300]  Like I said, when they're an inch tall, I determine the sex before they find their forever
[12:33.300 --> 12:35.460]  home so I don't waste space.
[12:35.460 --> 12:36.460]  I don't waste soil.
[12:36.460 --> 12:39.020]  I don't waste even waste the time up potting them.
[12:39.020 --> 12:41.220]  I don't waste the electricity.
[12:41.220 --> 12:43.460]  They go from seed into a beer cup.
[12:43.460 --> 12:44.620]  I get some Caudalinas.
[12:44.780 --> 12:45.780]  I let them grow.
[12:45.780 --> 12:46.780]  I put them into flower.
[12:46.780 --> 12:48.140]  They'll show me in.
[12:48.140 --> 12:51.060]  When they're that little, they'll show you pretty quickly if they're male or female.
[12:51.060 --> 12:53.060]  You can toss them really quickly.
[12:53.060 --> 12:54.660]  Then you don't even transplant the boys.
[12:54.660 --> 12:56.660]  They don't even make it to that stage.
[12:56.660 --> 12:59.020]  I would have done it much earlier.
[12:59.020 --> 13:04.060]  Then you're going to take your small plants, veg them for a week, then flower them for
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.980]  seven to 10 days, put them back into veg.
[13:06.980 --> 13:11.900]  Now in 10 to 12 days, those plants will go back into veg because they're so little, but
[13:11.900 --> 13:14.620]  we're going to grow them out for weeks because we're just starting them.
[13:14.620 --> 13:17.420]  They've got all that veg time to recover.
[13:17.420 --> 13:22.100]  They're going to continue to grow while the hormones go back into a vegetative stage.
[13:22.100 --> 13:23.100]  It won't take long.
[13:23.100 --> 13:26.700]  Depending on how deep into flower you got them, 10 or 12 days isn't too far.
[13:26.700 --> 13:31.500]  They should revert fairly quickly if they're little plants without a lot of changes in
[13:31.500 --> 13:32.740]  hormones.
[13:32.740 --> 13:34.900]  That should work better for you.
[13:34.900 --> 13:38.060]  What I can recommend that you can do with these plants, since you're already at this
[13:38.060 --> 13:40.940]  point, I do have a great recommendation for you.
[13:40.980 --> 13:45.460]  To minimize the stress on yourself and these plants, what I would do at this time is I
[13:45.460 --> 13:50.380]  would take a few clones from the plant that you're trying to sex and sex the clone.
[13:50.380 --> 13:51.820]  You've got these big fancy plants.
[13:51.820 --> 13:53.860]  They've been going for 45 days.
[13:53.860 --> 13:55.220]  You should have pretty big plants by now.
[13:55.220 --> 13:56.380]  They should be a couple of feet tall.
[13:56.380 --> 13:58.420]  They should be nice and branchy.
[13:58.420 --> 14:04.700]  You should have at least two or three, maybe four or five viable clones available off of
[14:04.700 --> 14:05.740]  each plant.
[14:05.740 --> 14:10.580]  I would get a clone dome and a tray and some clone plugs or an easy cloner if you really
[14:10.620 --> 14:11.620]  want to make an investment.
[14:11.620 --> 14:13.980]  If you've already got it, set it up, get it running.
[14:13.980 --> 14:15.980]  I would invest in a cloning setup.
[14:15.980 --> 14:19.100]  Then I would take a clone from each of these sunkissed plants.
[14:19.100 --> 14:22.340]  I don't know how many you have in there.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.340]  Couple of them.
[14:23.340 --> 14:24.340]  It sounds like just one.
[14:24.340 --> 14:27.900]  I would take two or three clones from the sunkissed plant.
[14:27.900 --> 14:30.020]  One of them, if you can, turn it into a mother plant.
[14:30.020 --> 14:32.500]  That way you've got a proven female for next time.
[14:32.500 --> 14:33.500]  You already know it's a girl.
[14:33.500 --> 14:34.780]  You don't have to sex it.
[14:34.780 --> 14:38.980]  This is how we do a ... See, I would have done a proper pheno hunt first is kind of
[14:38.980 --> 14:39.980]  what I'm getting at.
[14:40.380 --> 14:43.420]  I'm not going to get you a pheno hunt out of this to find out if you've got a plant
[14:43.420 --> 14:46.100]  that's even worth growing after 45 days.
[14:46.100 --> 14:47.820]  What I would do, let me get my ass back on track here.
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.220]  I would take a clone.
[14:49.220 --> 14:51.660]  I would get the clone and a clone dome.
[14:51.660 --> 14:53.560]  You've probably got four or five clones off there.
[14:53.560 --> 14:57.140]  Take four or five clones, maybe designate one as a mom.
[14:57.140 --> 14:58.300]  Keep that around.
[14:58.300 --> 15:01.780]  I would put this clone dome into flower right away.
[15:01.780 --> 15:03.980]  Get four or five clones, put them into flower.
[15:03.980 --> 15:08.500]  You can cut the clones, dip them, stick them, put them under 12-12 lighting.
[15:08.500 --> 15:11.500]  While they are rooting, they will also flip to flower.
[15:11.500 --> 15:17.300]  They will then show you in 7, 10, 12, maybe 14 days if they are boys or girls.
[15:17.300 --> 15:20.180]  Those clones will be boys or girls just like the plant they came from.
[15:20.180 --> 15:23.300]  You've only got one plant, so if it shows you boy, that plant's a boy.
[15:23.300 --> 15:25.660]  If it shows you girl, that plant is a girl.
[15:25.660 --> 15:27.140]  I would cut clones.
[15:27.140 --> 15:32.020]  Oftentimes, I like to lollipop my plants right before they go into flower.
[15:32.020 --> 15:33.980]  That means taking off the bottom stuff.
[15:33.980 --> 15:37.420]  If you can get a couple of good clones off the bottom, pull that stuff off there.
[15:37.420 --> 15:40.780]  You can clean the plant up and create clones at the same time.
[15:40.780 --> 15:44.860]  If your plant is getting tall and it's getting unruly, you can always take that center top
[15:44.860 --> 15:47.180]  right out of the middle and use that for a clone.
[15:47.180 --> 15:48.700]  I love cloning that center top.
[15:48.700 --> 15:53.700]  I top my plants anyway, so that topping, that just becomes a beautiful, healthy, hearty
[15:53.700 --> 15:54.700]  clone.
[15:54.700 --> 15:59.740]  I label that one clone A, plant A, put that clone in the clone dome, put it under 12-12
[15:59.740 --> 16:00.740]  lighting.
[16:00.740 --> 16:02.580]  Right now in my area, I'm in North America.
[16:02.580 --> 16:04.060]  I'm in Colorado.
[16:04.060 --> 16:07.860]  We're experiencing less than 12 hours of light per day.
[16:07.860 --> 16:10.660]  I think we're headed back up in daylight hours at this time.
[16:10.660 --> 16:15.780]  We might be going more, but still currently, we do experience fucking about six hours of
[16:15.780 --> 16:16.780]  daylight it feels like.
[16:16.780 --> 16:19.920]  I think we might get seven and a half, eight hours of daylight right now.
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.820]  If you put a clone dome in a window sill, it just provided it daylight.
[16:23.820 --> 16:24.820]  It has to stay warm.
[16:24.820 --> 16:25.820]  Don't get it cold.
[16:25.820 --> 16:28.700]  In Colorado, it might fucking freeze to death right now.
[16:28.700 --> 16:32.900]  Oddly, it's not cold enough, but it will get cold for the plant.
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.900]  Put that clone under 12-12 lighting.
[16:34.900 --> 16:38.380]  If it gets 12 hours of darkness every day, it will go into flower.
[16:38.380 --> 16:44.460]  Then in 10, 12, maybe 14 days, you will know if that plant is a male or female, and you
[16:44.460 --> 16:48.460]  won't have to stress out your big plant by putting it into flower, putting it back into
[16:48.460 --> 16:49.460]  veg.
[16:49.460 --> 16:53.740]  At this point, I would almost just put that, depending on how much space you've got, you've
[16:53.740 --> 16:55.260]  got the ... What's your size?
[16:55.260 --> 16:56.740]  I think you told me the size of your tent.
[16:56.740 --> 16:58.220]  No, it doesn't say the size.
[16:58.220 --> 17:02.100]  I would just put that bitch in a flower and grow it at this point, and then find out if
[17:02.300 --> 17:03.300]  it's a male or female.
[17:03.300 --> 17:05.860]  45 days, what are you waiting for?
[17:05.860 --> 17:07.620]  That's about how long my plants veg.
[17:07.620 --> 17:09.540]  They don't get that much more veg time.
[17:09.540 --> 17:13.860]  That bitch would be running, turn it and burn it at this point.
[17:13.860 --> 17:15.300]  You do have an option.
[17:15.300 --> 17:17.300]  You do have a couple of options.
[17:17.300 --> 17:20.780]  I wouldn't recommend putting the big plant into flower and then bringing it back.
[17:20.780 --> 17:24.540]  I would just veg for two more weeks, and then put it into flower and send it.
[17:24.540 --> 17:25.540]  Don't even bring it back.
[17:25.540 --> 17:26.540]  Just let it go.
[17:26.540 --> 17:27.540]  If it's a boy, it's a boy.
[17:27.540 --> 17:28.540]  You cut it down.
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.540]  If it's a girl, finish it.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.540]  Let it go all the way.
[17:30.540 --> 17:35.420]  Or your other option is to take a clone and put that clone under 12-12 lighting right
[17:35.420 --> 17:39.280]  away, and it will show you sex within just a few days.
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.340]  In the future, I would recommend to either get a clone from it much earlier.
[17:43.340 --> 17:49.300]  As soon as the plant is big enough to clone, cut a clone, sex the clone, or sex that plant
[17:49.300 --> 17:54.660]  when it is real tiny so we don't get 45 days in and not know if that plant is a boy or
[17:54.660 --> 17:55.660]  a girl.
[17:55.660 --> 17:59.960]  I couldn't handle 45 days wondering, is that a dude or is that a chick that I've been hanging
[17:59.960 --> 18:03.040]  out with, like I'd really want to know by now.
[18:03.040 --> 18:04.840]  I find out much earlier.
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.480]  That way, it would have never even ... It's probably in a three, maybe a five-gallon pot.
[18:08.480 --> 18:09.640]  Do you tell me in this message?
[18:09.640 --> 18:10.920]  You don't mention that.
[18:10.920 --> 18:13.920]  It's in a pot big enough to sustain it for 45 days.
[18:13.920 --> 18:17.280]  It's probably a three-gallon at least, which means you got three gallons of dirt, which
[18:17.280 --> 18:22.160]  means it's taking up at least a one-by-one, maybe a two-by-two square foot space in your
[18:22.160 --> 18:23.160]  grow space.
[18:23.160 --> 18:30.360]  It is definitely taking ... What's most valuable to me in that equation is the plant number.
[18:30.360 --> 18:32.640]  I'm only allowed so many plants.
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.120]  If that's a dude that I don't need, that's a wasted fucking number.
[18:36.120 --> 18:40.160]  I could have done something way better with a plant that I do need.
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.160]  Sometimes I need a boy.
[18:41.160 --> 18:42.480]  Sometimes I need a female.
[18:42.480 --> 18:46.160]  If I don't need a boy and it's a boy, get rid of it so I can replace it.
[18:46.160 --> 18:47.960]  I can have 12.
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.960]  Every one of those 12 counts when you're a seed breeder trying to create new shit, trying
[18:51.960 --> 18:55.800]  to discover things, female hunt, keep moms, it gets hectic.
[18:55.800 --> 18:57.520]  It's a fun juggle.
[18:57.520 --> 19:00.520]  Let me quickly recap because that is my style.
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.000]  What I would have done is I would have flowered it much sooner and then put it back into veg.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.760]  When it was six inches tall, it would have gone into flower.
[19:07.760 --> 19:10.440]  Maybe even three or five inches tall, it would have gone into flower.
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.480]  We would have discovered if it was a boy or a girl, then put it right back.
[19:13.480 --> 19:14.720]  That way I don't have to take a clone.
[19:14.720 --> 19:16.320]  I don't have another plant count.
[19:16.320 --> 19:19.000]  That's a way to dodge another plant in the count.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.840]  Just flower that one, then it's still there.
[19:21.920 --> 19:24.000]  That clone just doubled my plant count.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.120]  If I clone everything to sex test it, I just doubled my fucking count.
[19:28.120 --> 19:29.120]  I would do that.
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.320]  Or there's another option I almost looked over, sex testing.
[19:32.320 --> 19:34.160]  You can do the mail-in sex testing.
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.200]  Order a sex test card, rub your weed plant on the card, mail it in.
[19:37.200 --> 19:39.280]  The lab will tell you if it's a boy or a girl.
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.640]  Let me get back on track where I was.
[19:41.640 --> 19:46.720]  What I would do, what I would recommend is the early sexing from a small plant or grow
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.720]  it and get a clone, sex test the clone.
[19:49.720 --> 19:52.160]  When you do the clones, also you can revert the clones.
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.680]  They'll go back quicker and you can keep a mom that way.
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.840]  Or you can put this bad bitch into flower and see what it does.
[19:59.840 --> 20:05.360]  At this point, I know it may sound crazy, but dude, you're 45 days in.
[20:05.360 --> 20:07.880]  How long do you really plan on vegging this plant?
[20:07.880 --> 20:09.520]  How big do you want it?
[20:09.520 --> 20:10.760]  You're already 45 days in.
[20:10.760 --> 20:13.040]  I would just turn it and burn it.
[20:13.040 --> 20:14.040]  Send it.
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.040]  See what you got.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.000]  If it's a boy, you've wasted 45 days.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.360]  If it's a girl, you're going to have a decent harvest.
[20:19.360 --> 20:23.720]  If you want to keep vegging it, it's going to get big.
[20:23.720 --> 20:28.760]  I think quicker veg cycles and more cycles per year is more productive in my opinion.
[20:28.760 --> 20:29.760]  I don't know your space.
[20:29.760 --> 20:33.280]  I don't know your situation, but my advice, fucking send it.
[20:33.280 --> 20:34.280]  Get her done.
[20:34.280 --> 20:35.280]  Get that bitch out of there.
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.280]  Get it going.
[20:36.280 --> 20:37.640]  Get more plants in.
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.280]  I would already flowered a crop by now.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.880]  I would have been ahead of you.
[20:40.880 --> 20:42.600]  Anyway, that's just what I would do.
[20:42.600 --> 20:44.920]  My buddy Dave from Ontario.
[20:44.920 --> 20:49.520]  I hope I did not break your heart by giving you, uh, by saying that, uh, I wouldn't do
[20:49.520 --> 20:50.680]  what you're planning to do.
[20:50.680 --> 20:53.040]  It will work, but it will be stressful.
[20:53.040 --> 20:54.280]  There are better ways to do it.
[20:54.280 --> 20:58.000]  What I did do was I set you up with strategies and ideas for the future.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.280]  We set you up for success for next time.
[21:00.280 --> 21:03.020]  So I hope something was helpful.
[21:03.020 --> 21:04.320]  Something works out for you.
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, real
[21:09.560 --> 21:14.760]  people, figments of my imagination, virtual reality, the metaverse.
[21:15.600 --> 21:16.600]  This beautiful universe we are in together.
[21:16.600 --> 21:19.800]  I want to thank you once again for listening, watching, joining me for another episode of
