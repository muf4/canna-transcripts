[00:16.700 --> 00:19.180]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.180 --> 00:20.300]  It's time for another episode
[00:20.300 --> 00:22.420]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.420 --> 00:25.880]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.880 --> 00:27.560]  If you're a new grower, a pro grower,
[00:27.560 --> 00:29.660]  if you're a new smoker, or if you're a veteran dabber,
[00:29.660 --> 00:31.480]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.820]  or if you're just someone who's curious
[00:32.820 --> 00:34.180]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.180 --> 00:36.140]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:36.140 --> 00:37.720]  I'm your host, Ross DeJeff,
[00:37.720 --> 00:39.460]  and it's time for episode number 53.
[00:39.460 --> 00:40.480]  I'm having a hard time breathing
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.380]  because we just took some fat dabs in this room.
[00:42.380 --> 00:44.700]  Everyone's looking at me like, yes we did.
[00:44.700 --> 00:45.580]  Thanks for joining us guys.
[00:45.580 --> 00:47.780]  Sitting to my left, we've got King Cola again.
[00:47.780 --> 00:48.860]  Welcome back bro.
[00:48.860 --> 00:49.800]  Thanks for having me man.
[00:49.800 --> 00:52.100]  And right kind of in front of me and to my left a little bit,
[00:52.100 --> 00:53.700]  I'm gonna say like the 11 o'clock position
[00:53.700 --> 00:54.660]  is my new friend, Alan.
[00:54.660 --> 00:55.480]  How you doing bro?
[00:55.480 --> 00:56.320]  What's going on man?
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.140]  Nice to meet you.
[00:57.140 --> 00:58.620]  And over here, the guy who I wanna call somebody else
[00:58.620 --> 01:00.540]  because I was told somebody else was coming,
[01:00.540 --> 01:02.180]  but my good friend Nick is over here.
[01:02.180 --> 01:03.580]  How's it going?
[01:03.580 --> 01:04.420]  Jay couldn't make it.
[01:04.420 --> 01:05.580]  I promised you guys Jay would be here,
[01:05.580 --> 01:08.900]  but instead of Jay, he sent three minions in his place.
[01:08.900 --> 01:10.060]  That's how important that dude is.
[01:10.060 --> 01:11.900]  He sent me three guys.
[01:11.900 --> 01:12.900]  And we've been sitting here at the table
[01:12.900 --> 01:13.860]  bullshitting for a few minutes,
[01:13.900 --> 01:15.940]  and these guys know their worms.
[01:15.940 --> 01:16.900]  We're ready to talk.
[01:16.900 --> 01:18.260]  Ready to talk wormage.
[01:18.260 --> 01:20.740]  They got all the worm puns figured out already.
[01:20.740 --> 01:22.340]  These should have heard the worm puns.
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.700]  Before we get too far guys,
[01:23.700 --> 01:26.900]  I gotta give a big shout out thanks to Koo and Kat
[01:26.900 --> 01:27.780]  from the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:27.780 --> 01:29.940]  They allow me to play their music at the start of the show.
[01:29.940 --> 01:31.660]  That is cool as shit because playing music
[01:31.660 --> 01:34.740]  on a podcast is expensive.
[01:34.740 --> 01:35.740]  I know that sounds weird,
[01:35.740 --> 01:37.560]  but you gotta pay to play people's music on your show.
[01:37.560 --> 01:38.980]  Why do you gotta do that man?
[01:38.980 --> 01:41.220]  Music should be free, free, free, free freedom.
[01:41.220 --> 01:42.140]  Royalties.
[01:42.140 --> 01:42.980]  Royalties.
[01:43.100 --> 01:43.980]  We are royalty.
[01:43.980 --> 01:45.700]  We're the kings of cannabis, aren't we?
[01:45.700 --> 01:46.540]  We should.
[01:46.540 --> 01:47.620]  Art is not free anymore.
[01:47.620 --> 01:48.460]  That's true.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.300]  Art is not.
[01:49.300 --> 01:50.220]  Well, the artist has got to get paid.
[01:50.220 --> 01:51.060]  I guess that's cool.
[01:51.060 --> 01:53.060]  Thanks Kat and Koot for letting me play their stuff.
[01:53.060 --> 01:55.260]  Ooh, you just pulled out a cool surprise.
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.500]  The solventless.
[01:56.500 --> 01:58.220]  That's gonna totally interrupt the show.
[01:58.220 --> 01:59.060]  Nice.
[01:59.060 --> 02:01.180]  Lemon headed stranger.
[02:01.180 --> 02:02.100]  Yeah, I forgot it was in the bag.
[02:02.100 --> 02:04.060]  Oh dude, that is terpidelic.
[02:04.060 --> 02:04.900]  Terpidelic.
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.060]  It's trichome heavy, so.
[02:06.060 --> 02:07.980]  Trichome heavy extracts.
[02:08.860 --> 02:10.500]  That smells, man, that totally derailed me.
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.140]  I was gonna do an ad for Hygro, but.
[02:12.140 --> 02:14.500]  It's like lemon paint thinner.
[02:14.500 --> 02:16.900]  Yeah, lemon paint thinner.
[02:16.900 --> 02:18.500]  Took a trip to Lowe's to get some Lowe's supplies.
[02:18.500 --> 02:19.860]  Came up with some more hash.
[02:19.860 --> 02:21.900]  Figure out a good way to dab that one.
[02:21.900 --> 02:23.180]  This podcast is brought to you by your good friends

[03:58.340 --> 04:00.540]  but he's got some fire for sure.
[04:00.540 --> 04:02.140]  Yeah, that's a good place to work with.
[04:02.140 --> 04:02.980]  Yeah, speeding.
[04:02.980 --> 04:03.980]  I don't have any other distributors
[04:03.980 --> 04:04.940]  because they're the only ones I need
[04:04.940 --> 04:05.940]  because they do it right for me.
[04:05.980 --> 04:06.820]  I think Yankee.
[04:06.820 --> 04:08.060]  Yeah, Yankee's the dude.
[04:08.060 --> 04:08.900]  Yeah, shout out to Yankee.
[04:08.900 --> 04:09.740]  I hope you listen.
[04:09.740 --> 04:11.620]  He listens sometimes, but we're 50 something in.
[04:11.620 --> 04:12.580]  You know, you can't listen to all of them.
[04:12.580 --> 04:13.500]  He's a real cool dude.
[04:13.500 --> 04:14.340]  Shout out, bro.
[04:14.340 --> 04:15.180]  Hope you hear us.
[04:15.180 --> 04:16.700]  Much respect to all the sponsors.
[04:16.700 --> 04:17.860]  We're gonna announce it right now.
[04:17.860 --> 04:19.020]  One of our new sponsors.
[04:19.020 --> 04:19.860]  What's the official name?
[04:19.860 --> 04:21.020]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company?
[04:21.020 --> 04:22.380]  Yeah, Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.420]  This podcast is now brought to you
[04:23.420 --> 04:25.260]  by the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.100]  I don't know what to say yet
[04:26.100 --> 04:27.420]  because I have not written a commercial.
[04:27.420 --> 04:28.340]  What you worming with?
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.940]  Do worm, son.
[04:29.940 --> 04:31.900]  We could go on forever with that, I think.
[04:31.900 --> 04:34.220]  There'll be some cool worm puns going on pretty soon here.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.700]  But yeah, those guys are gonna help me out.
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.540]  They're going to contribute organics
[04:37.540 --> 04:39.940]  and they're gonna, part of their sponsorship,
[04:39.940 --> 04:41.500]  they don't know it, but I'm gonna sucker them
[04:41.500 --> 04:43.540]  into teaching me how to throw away my bottles
[04:43.540 --> 04:45.300]  and we're gonna get me working with all organics
[04:45.300 --> 04:46.860]  that will be supplied by them.
[04:46.860 --> 04:49.100]  So all of my grow equipment will come from Hygro
[04:49.100 --> 04:50.740]  and all of my organic supplies
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.420]  will come from the worm company.
[04:52.420 --> 04:54.300]  We're gonna be killing it with the sponsorship help.
[04:54.300 --> 04:55.340]  Sounds like a plan.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.340]  Yeah, I like it.
[04:56.340 --> 04:58.740]  You guys are, you've changed my growing already.
[04:58.740 --> 05:00.500]  I've been using a lot more Growkashi,
[05:00.500 --> 05:01.820]  a lot of worm castings and stuff.
[05:01.820 --> 05:03.500]  And I've got a question about that coming up for you
[05:03.500 --> 05:05.100]  in just a couple seconds.
[05:05.100 --> 05:06.740]  I think we can almost get to that.
[05:06.740 --> 05:07.660]  Let's see.
[05:07.660 --> 05:08.600]  I said, thanks to everybody.
[05:08.600 --> 05:10.300]  I read the commercials.
[05:10.300 --> 05:11.820]  Yeah, dude, I wanna thank you guys for coming.
[05:11.820 --> 05:13.300]  These guys showed up early, dude.
[05:13.300 --> 05:16.320]  Three paw heads showed up to my house early.
[05:16.320 --> 05:17.420]  I was impressed.
[05:17.420 --> 05:18.740]  Yeah, that worked out really well.
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.620]  Yeah, it was like pulled up at the same time.
[05:20.620 --> 05:22.100]  Five seconds after we did.
[05:22.100 --> 05:24.140]  Nice, nice, punctual stoners.
[05:24.140 --> 05:26.060]  So this will be a perfect question
[05:26.060 --> 05:28.740]  since you guys are from the organic side of the growing.
[05:28.740 --> 05:30.260]  I've been talking about Growkashi.
[05:30.260 --> 05:31.900]  I actually gave some Growkashi away
[05:31.900 --> 05:33.700]  in a prize package recently.
[05:33.700 --> 05:35.060]  And one of my listeners,
[05:35.060 --> 05:36.460]  a lot of the listeners have been asking
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.980]  how to use the Growkashi.
[05:39.260 --> 05:41.980]  I read the instructions and it says to fill up your reservoir
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.340]  with however many gallons of water.
[05:43.340 --> 05:45.420]  And then you add a third of a cup of Kashi
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.240]  and then you mix in,
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.900]  I don't remember the specific amount of molasses,
[05:47.900 --> 05:51.820]  but you mix in a specific amount of molasses per gallon.
[05:51.820 --> 05:54.820]  And then you let it sit for 24 to 48 hours.
[05:54.820 --> 05:57.640]  And then that, I use that, excuse my cough guys,
[05:57.640 --> 05:59.300]  we took some gnarly dabs.
[05:59.300 --> 06:01.380]  After that's mixed, I use that
[06:01.900 --> 06:03.300]  and just water it into the top of my plants.
[06:03.300 --> 06:05.340]  And I noticed that they love it.
[06:05.340 --> 06:08.140]  Do you guys have other ways that you prefer or recommend?
[06:08.140 --> 06:09.220]  Do you guys want to take that?
[06:09.220 --> 06:10.780]  There's a ton of other ways.
[06:10.780 --> 06:12.460]  You can put it in your soil.
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.720]  You guys, this is Alan on the mic
[06:13.720 --> 06:15.620]  just so that you know who you're listening to.
[06:15.620 --> 06:19.380]  You can put it in your teas, top dress,
[06:19.380 --> 06:21.740]  you can get your mycelium going on the top layer.
[06:21.740 --> 06:24.340]  With that, sometimes you want to put a mulch down.
[06:24.340 --> 06:25.340]  You don't want it to get too dry.
[06:25.340 --> 06:26.820]  So you got to watch out with that.
[06:26.820 --> 06:30.280]  But definitely have seen results layering it in your pot
[06:30.280 --> 06:32.080]  as you transplant.
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.760]  Okay, so some dirt, then some kashi,
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.480]  then some dirt, then some kashi.
[06:35.480 --> 06:36.400]  You know, whatever you're doing,
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.960]  whatever your organic heart desires.
[06:38.960 --> 06:39.780]  And since you're in there,
[06:39.780 --> 06:40.840]  throwing some worm castings, right?
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.160]  Worm castings everywhere.
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.240]  Every time, everywhere.
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.400]  I've seen a difference in my plants.
[06:45.400 --> 06:47.040]  I've only been using them for a week.
[06:47.040 --> 06:49.640]  And my plants, they're more vigorous.
[06:49.640 --> 06:52.100]  They're wanting more water more often
[06:52.100 --> 06:53.800]  because they're growing so much more.
[06:53.800 --> 06:57.000]  It's because they're learning how to eat by themselves.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.080]  They're starting to cycle nutrients.
[06:59.080 --> 07:00.120]  Basically what you're doing
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.600]  is when you're growing synthetically,
[07:01.600 --> 07:05.960]  you're just bypassing this entire organic life.
[07:05.960 --> 07:08.560]  Yeah, I mean, you're just cutting everything out.
[07:08.560 --> 07:10.840]  So you're force feeding it.
[07:10.840 --> 07:11.680]  Exactly.
[07:11.680 --> 07:13.320]  Taking the shortcut through the rhizosphere.
[07:13.320 --> 07:14.160]  Okay.
[07:14.160 --> 07:14.980]  Exactly.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.680]  You know, that's actually why hydro growers
[07:16.680 --> 07:18.920]  have to supplement with so much CO2.
[07:18.920 --> 07:21.640]  There's no CO2 produced in the decomposition of the soil.
[07:21.640 --> 07:22.840]  In the decomposition of the natural soil.
[07:22.840 --> 07:23.680]  Okay.
[07:23.680 --> 07:24.880]  I don't have the number in front of me,
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.220]  but I've been doing some research lately.
[07:26.260 --> 07:28.980]  But yeah, there's actually a significant amount of CO2
[07:28.980 --> 07:30.900]  put off running like a no-till system
[07:30.900 --> 07:31.740]  in larger containers.
[07:31.740 --> 07:34.460]  There's a lot of importance to decomposition.
[07:34.460 --> 07:37.500]  You can't, we're taught science,
[07:37.500 --> 07:39.780]  but it's not science, it's all nature.
[07:39.780 --> 07:41.860]  It's been done for thousands of years.
[07:41.860 --> 07:43.580]  You know, Koreans and-
[07:43.580 --> 07:45.540]  And that goes back to the Bokashi.
[07:45.540 --> 07:47.660]  Yeah, Bokashi's been around forever.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.740]  It's nothing new.
[07:48.740 --> 07:49.940]  You know, it's not rocket science.
[07:49.940 --> 07:52.140]  What's the difference between Bokashi and Grokashi?
[07:52.140 --> 07:53.500]  I'm good on that joint, dude.
[07:53.500 --> 07:54.340]  Here, I'll take a hit
[07:54.340 --> 07:55.780]  because you looked at me like I'm a puss.
[07:56.300 --> 07:57.700]  I just don't need the cotton mouth on the show here.
[07:57.700 --> 07:59.660]  So it's kind of like a,
[07:59.660 --> 08:02.340]  it's like a band, you know, like the Band-Aid brand.
[08:02.340 --> 08:04.580]  Grokashi's kind of taken over the industry like that.
[08:04.580 --> 08:05.420]  Okay.
[08:05.420 --> 08:08.060]  So Grokashi is Bokashi.
[08:09.180 --> 08:11.100]  They are the same thing.
[08:11.100 --> 08:15.380]  It's just Grokashi makes their own mix of Bokashi.
[08:15.380 --> 08:17.460]  Bokashi is nothing but a-
[08:18.460 --> 08:19.300]  Brand.
[08:19.300 --> 08:21.380]  Yeah, basically it's a brand, or it can be any medium.
[08:21.380 --> 08:23.940]  You can use sticks or stems or oat bran,
[08:23.940 --> 08:27.020]  just any sort of carbon-based material.
[08:27.020 --> 08:30.620]  Then you're gonna inoculate it with typically yeast,
[08:30.620 --> 08:33.500]  photosynthetic bacteria, and a lactic acid bacteria.
[08:33.500 --> 08:34.820]  So that's an EM1,
[08:34.820 --> 08:37.300]  if you're familiar with your follower feeds and stuff.
[08:37.300 --> 08:38.140]  Yeah, and actually I got the-
[08:38.140 --> 08:38.980]  It's pretty important.
[08:38.980 --> 08:39.820]  Probiotic Farmers Alliance stuff that we do a lot about that.
[08:39.820 --> 08:41.660]  And then if I'm not mistaken,
[08:41.660 --> 08:45.180]  Grokashi actually adds in glacial rock dust
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.460]  for trace minerals.
[08:46.460 --> 08:49.900]  So that's kind of what makes up their mix.
[08:49.900 --> 08:50.740]  Okay.
[08:50.740 --> 08:52.940]  Rocky Mount Worm Company will actually start carrying
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.900]  their own Bokashi here soon.
[08:54.900 --> 08:57.100]  Yeah, you can add a lot to your Bokashi.
[08:57.100 --> 09:00.260]  And ours will actually be inoculated with humic acid,
[09:00.260 --> 09:01.100]  some local-
[09:01.100 --> 09:01.940]  Very cool.
[09:01.940 --> 09:05.140]  So basically you'll get a little piece of our gardens
[09:05.140 --> 09:06.540]  in yours, it'll be pretty neat.
[09:06.540 --> 09:07.900]  A little bit of love spread around.
[09:07.900 --> 09:08.740]  Yeah.
[09:08.740 --> 09:10.740]  And then we wanna try to keep it local.
[09:10.740 --> 09:13.180]  Rocky Mountain Natural Farm is trying to keep everything
[09:13.180 --> 09:15.500]  in Colorado, bring back to the community.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.340]  That's really cool.
[09:16.340 --> 09:17.180]  Yeah, cause it's important,
[09:17.180 --> 09:20.300]  especially in the cannabis community to give back to others.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.660]  And you see it a lot in other states
[09:21.660 --> 09:23.740]  that have been doing it a little longer.
[09:23.740 --> 09:27.020]  Their community is a little bit more integrated.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.700]  Up in NorCal, a lot of people-
[09:28.700 --> 09:29.780]  That's how farming should work.
[09:29.780 --> 09:30.620]  Exactly.
[09:30.620 --> 09:31.460]  And this is farming.
[09:31.460 --> 09:32.300]  Exactly.
[09:32.300 --> 09:33.540]  It's a specialized product, but it's definitely farming.
[09:33.540 --> 09:34.820]  It's an artisan product.
[09:35.740 --> 09:38.660]  It goes with anything, with wine, cheese, meats.
[09:39.900 --> 09:41.660]  It's just, you should have the best-
[09:41.660 --> 09:42.500]  Instruments.
[09:42.500 --> 09:43.620]  Instruments, yeah.
[09:43.620 --> 09:44.460]  Anything, yeah.
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.380]  Computers, cars.
[09:45.380 --> 09:49.260]  You should want the best in with organic practices.
[09:49.260 --> 09:51.100]  That's what you get in actual medicine
[09:51.540 --> 09:53.500]  and that's pure.
[09:53.500 --> 09:57.220]  You're not smoking anything that shouldn't be in your body.
[09:57.220 --> 09:58.180]  A map and dab.
[09:58.180 --> 09:59.260]  Yeah.
[09:59.260 --> 10:01.740]  Sean just gave me the, yeah, get away from the map and dab.
[10:01.740 --> 10:03.140]  It makes me want to get back
[10:03.140 --> 10:05.900]  to the how to use the Grokashi though.
[10:05.900 --> 10:07.580]  I don't want to leave them without some sort of answer.
[10:07.580 --> 10:08.980]  I was definitely going to come back around.
[10:08.980 --> 10:10.180]  I'd definitely try to do that.
[10:10.180 --> 10:13.820]  Yeah, so basically for me personally,
[10:13.820 --> 10:15.580]  if you just want me to tell you how I use Grokashi.
[10:15.580 --> 10:17.780]  Yeah, let's hear it, cause you're great at this field.
[10:17.780 --> 10:19.340]  Well, thank you.
[10:19.380 --> 10:22.860]  So basically when I do my initial transplant
[10:22.860 --> 10:27.140]  out of a red solo cup, I'll, the soil mix traditionally,
[10:27.140 --> 10:28.180]  cause I make my own soils,
[10:28.180 --> 10:30.060]  we'll have Grokashi in it already.
[10:30.060 --> 10:32.980]  Or my own form of Bokashi or Grokashi.
[10:32.980 --> 10:35.020]  So we'll, it'll have it in the soil mix,
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.300]  but I always top dress.
[10:36.300 --> 10:39.020]  Every time I transplant, always top dress.
[10:39.020 --> 10:41.820]  And usually it's with a cover crop,
[10:41.820 --> 10:45.180]  a little bit of Grokashi, a little bit of worm castings.
[10:45.180 --> 10:47.860]  And then I'll just water it in with a product we carry
[10:47.860 --> 10:49.620]  that's called C-Crop.
[10:49.620 --> 10:50.580]  I heard a lot about that.
[10:50.580 --> 10:52.100]  It's amazing.
[10:52.100 --> 10:55.620]  It's basically, it's kind of like fermented seawater.
[10:55.620 --> 10:56.580]  If I had to, yeah.
[10:56.580 --> 10:58.300]  Is that your fish?
[10:58.300 --> 10:59.900]  No, it's not a fish emulsion.
[10:59.900 --> 11:02.180]  I would say I use this in place traditionally
[11:02.180 --> 11:03.900]  of if you're familiar with full power.
[11:03.900 --> 11:04.740]  Okay.
[11:04.740 --> 11:05.900]  I kind of use it in the place of that.
[11:05.900 --> 11:08.180]  It's got a lot of fulvic acids, a lot of trace minerals,
[11:08.180 --> 11:11.060]  a lot of things that you're not going to get,
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.500]  you know, from your basic.
[11:12.500 --> 11:14.780]  What you see a lot of coastal growers use.
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.180]  We don't have a micronutrient bottle to use.
[11:18.180 --> 11:20.660]  So we use a C-Crop, but yeah.
[11:20.660 --> 11:23.260]  So I usually water in with a C-Crop right after that.
[11:23.260 --> 11:27.980]  And then we'll roll into, basically after that,
[11:27.980 --> 11:29.820]  it'll be every two weeks.
[11:29.820 --> 11:33.380]  I'll go through and do a Grokashi Dreg,
[11:33.380 --> 11:36.060]  which is basically what you're referring to.
[11:36.060 --> 11:38.340]  I do mine a little bit differently.
[11:38.340 --> 11:41.860]  So what I like to do is use a grinded herb,
[11:41.860 --> 11:45.860]  traditionally like a Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[11:46.820 --> 11:49.180]  So I'll use a, take basically,
[11:49.180 --> 11:53.980]  if I'm doing a 10 gallon thing of tea or Grokashi Dreg,
[11:53.980 --> 11:56.460]  so I'll take my Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[11:56.460 --> 11:58.300]  I'll mix it in there, depending on, you know,
[11:58.300 --> 12:01.420]  flower, veg, radiant green, or flat flower.
[12:01.420 --> 12:02.420]  Dump that in there.
[12:02.420 --> 12:05.180]  If you don't have those, you can use alfalfa or kelp.
[12:05.180 --> 12:06.020]  Okay.
[12:06.020 --> 12:07.260]  You know, so I dump that in there.
[12:07.260 --> 12:08.820]  Usually at whatever recommended rate
[12:08.820 --> 12:10.580]  you're going to run a tea with.
[12:10.660 --> 12:13.860]  Then I add in a fourth a cup of, you know,
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.380]  Bokashi per gallon,
[12:16.220 --> 12:18.620]  fourth a cup of worm castings per gallon,
[12:18.620 --> 12:21.220]  and then one teaspoon of,
[12:22.180 --> 12:23.740]  depending on what stage,
[12:23.740 --> 12:26.260]  I'll either use molasses or yucca
[12:26.260 --> 12:28.100]  in some sort of carbohydrate source.
[12:28.100 --> 12:28.940]  Yeah.
[12:28.940 --> 12:32.420]  And then I seal it up and then forget about it.
[12:32.420 --> 12:34.820]  They say like 12 to 24 hours,
[12:34.820 --> 12:36.900]  but in my personal experience,
[12:36.900 --> 12:39.660]  nothing's wrong with taking it 14 days.
[12:39.660 --> 12:40.500]  Wow. Okay.
[12:41.340 --> 12:42.180]  You're fermenting.
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.020]  So yeah, as long as-
[12:43.020 --> 12:43.860]  You want it to go a little longer.
[12:43.860 --> 12:46.580]  Rule of thumb, if it smells bad, it is bad.
[12:46.580 --> 12:47.420]  Okay.
[12:47.420 --> 12:49.940]  And if you're familiar with kombucha,
[12:49.940 --> 12:51.780]  probiotics, kimchi, things like that,
[12:51.780 --> 12:54.780]  you'll start to learn what good ferments are,
[12:54.780 --> 12:56.300]  what bad ferments are.
[12:56.300 --> 12:59.100]  So you want that almost sweet, bitter, and not funky.
[12:59.100 --> 12:59.940]  Exactly.
[12:59.940 --> 13:00.780]  Okay.
[13:00.780 --> 13:01.600]  Exactly.
[13:01.600 --> 13:02.440]  Kind of like a pickling.
[13:02.440 --> 13:04.300]  Yeah. Once the fish smell overpowers,
[13:04.300 --> 13:05.140]  then it's funk, right?
[13:05.140 --> 13:05.980]  Yes, exactly.
[13:05.980 --> 13:06.800]  Okay.
[13:06.800 --> 13:07.640]  That makes sense to me.
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.480]  When you can tolerate it in your mouth.
[13:08.480 --> 13:09.300]  And then as far as-
[13:09.300 --> 13:10.740]  You want to seal it up also, you said?
[13:10.740 --> 13:11.580]  Yeah.
[13:11.580 --> 13:12.620]  What I usually do is,
[13:12.620 --> 13:15.100]  everybody's probably got a bunch of panda film
[13:15.100 --> 13:16.420]  laying around somewhere.
[13:16.420 --> 13:18.100]  So what I usually do is cut a big square
[13:18.100 --> 13:19.780]  or have a big square of panda film
[13:19.780 --> 13:21.420]  that was left over from like a floor,
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.020]  a door, or something I made.
[13:23.020 --> 13:25.580]  And I just lay it over the container
[13:25.580 --> 13:28.100]  and wrap it in string and tie it tight.
[13:28.100 --> 13:28.940]  There you go.
[13:28.940 --> 13:29.780]  That's it.
[13:29.780 --> 13:31.220]  I mean, it doesn't have to be-
[13:31.220 --> 13:32.300]  Organics is not fancy.
[13:32.300 --> 13:33.140]  Yeah.
[13:33.140 --> 13:36.020]  You know, this is all in my basement at the home.
[13:36.020 --> 13:36.860]  It doesn't steal-
[13:36.860 --> 13:37.680]  If you really want to get-
[13:37.680 --> 13:39.560]  What happened by nature running down a hill
[13:39.560 --> 13:40.880]  into a big shitty puddle?
[13:40.880 --> 13:41.720]  Exactly.
[13:41.720 --> 13:43.160]  Yeah, so it's not fancy.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.320]  Yeah, so the idea is that we're going to try
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.880]  to balance out aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.280]  In nature, both exist.
[13:51.280 --> 13:52.800]  Like for the exact reason you were saying,
[13:52.800 --> 13:55.840]  things fall on the ground, they decay.
[13:55.840 --> 13:57.680]  You have puddles of stagnant water,
[13:57.680 --> 13:59.640]  animals dying, hot spots in the ground.
[13:59.640 --> 14:02.360]  So by introducing these things on a regular basis,
[14:02.360 --> 14:05.480]  I feel that that's where we're kind of getting
[14:05.480 --> 14:07.180]  a biological edge.
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.480]  I see a difference in my plants.
[14:09.480 --> 14:11.160]  And I know it's only been a couple of weeks,
[14:11.160 --> 14:12.980]  but just feeding them, they're more vigorous.
[14:12.980 --> 14:14.160]  They are ready to grow.
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.320]  It's basically, yeah, so you've got your
[14:17.320 --> 14:19.660]  protozoa cycle nutrients, your fungal hypha,
[14:19.660 --> 14:22.500]  the bacteria content, there's nematodes in there.
[14:22.500 --> 14:25.040]  So you're just getting this-
[14:25.040 --> 14:27.720]  I mean, it's funny because you go to the Hydro store
[14:27.720 --> 14:29.400]  and you see that they sell nematodes
[14:29.400 --> 14:30.920]  and you see that they sell great white
[14:30.920 --> 14:33.040]  and you see that they sell OG tea
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.480]  and they sell all of these things.
[14:34.480 --> 14:36.560]  And it's like, you take some time to go
[14:36.560 --> 14:38.760]  to Rocky Mount Worm Company's website,
[14:38.760 --> 14:40.280]  you can actually look it up and you'll see
[14:40.280 --> 14:43.640]  that all of these things are already in your worm castings.
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.200]  And you can make your own.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.160]  You take five small scoops of worm castings
[14:48.160 --> 14:49.960]  in a five gallon bucket of water,
[14:49.960 --> 14:52.320]  of good clean water, reverse osmosis clean,
[14:52.320 --> 14:55.120]  dechlorinated water, and bubble that shit for like 12 hours
[14:55.120 --> 14:56.520]  and you've just made great white.
[14:56.520 --> 14:58.520]  You've made all of those products on the shelf.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.600]  Exactly, and I will say that if you're new to making teas
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.780]  or even if you're familiar with making teas
[15:04.780 --> 15:07.300]  with worm castings, a lot of people will use
[15:07.300 --> 15:10.260]  like an Alaskan humus from General Organics
[15:10.260 --> 15:11.940]  or different things like that.
[15:11.940 --> 15:14.940]  Traditionally, they're using one cup per gallon.
[15:14.940 --> 15:17.420]  Please don't waste your, like you're just gonna be
[15:17.420 --> 15:19.540]  wasting money and you're gonna be creating a mess.
[15:19.540 --> 15:21.180]  They are very powerful worm castings.
[15:21.180 --> 15:24.180]  A fourth a cup per gallon is all you're gonna need with Jays.
[15:24.180 --> 15:25.420]  Nice, I'm gonna write that down
[15:25.420 --> 15:27.580]  because I think I used more to tell you the truth.
[15:27.580 --> 15:28.940]  I have it written down in the pro.
[15:28.940 --> 15:33.940]  And honestly, I would even go one cup per five gallon bucket
[15:33.980 --> 15:35.260]  just to keep it real simple.
[15:35.260 --> 15:36.100]  Nice.
[15:36.100 --> 15:37.620]  But yeah, you're gonna get every result.
[15:37.620 --> 15:39.180]  And you gotta leave some room for foam, you guys.
[15:39.180 --> 15:40.820]  Leave room for foam, because that shit's gonna foam up.
[15:40.820 --> 15:43.340]  And if you do have a problem with foam,
[15:43.340 --> 15:47.020]  you can always add in some sort of like fat, lipids.
[15:47.020 --> 15:49.820]  So you could use like a fish hydro slate will take it out,
[15:49.820 --> 15:53.060]  neem oil, karraja oil, coconut oil.
[15:53.060 --> 15:55.700]  If I put neem oil in there, how much would I use?
[15:55.700 --> 15:59.180]  Honestly, to take away foam, you would just kind of like
[15:59.180 --> 16:01.140]  drip it off your finger out of the bottle
[16:01.140 --> 16:02.340]  and it'll just kind of go away.
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.180]  It'll kill the foam.
[16:03.180 --> 16:05.700]  I would recommend more or less just throwing a,
[16:05.700 --> 16:07.220]  plants love coconuts.
[16:07.220 --> 16:09.420]  I mean, seriously, coconut water, coconut powder.
[16:09.420 --> 16:10.260]  If you can get into it.
[16:10.260 --> 16:11.100]  I love coconuts.
[16:11.100 --> 16:13.420]  If you eat them and you buy them at the supermarket,
[16:13.420 --> 16:14.540]  go ahead and grab an extra one
[16:14.540 --> 16:16.020]  and throw it in every so often.
[16:16.020 --> 16:17.060]  But yeah, I would throw a tea,
[16:17.060 --> 16:19.520]  like if your stuff's foaming up too bad,
[16:19.520 --> 16:21.220]  throw a little bit of coconut oil in there.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.300]  Your plants will like it.
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.140]  Foam will go away.
[16:23.140 --> 16:24.900]  Keep your floor nice and clean.
[16:24.900 --> 16:28.500]  If not, buy a drip tray twice the size of your brewer.
[16:29.820 --> 16:31.740]  Or brew it in like a Rubbermaid container.
[16:31.740 --> 16:34.060]  Organics can get hands on and a little messy,
[16:34.060 --> 16:34.900]  but don't be afraid.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.820]  That's the fun part.
[16:35.820 --> 16:37.580]  I used to, when I started,
[16:37.580 --> 16:38.860]  I've been through every nutrient line.
[16:38.860 --> 16:41.380]  I miss back in the day mixing 42 bottles
[16:41.380 --> 16:42.980]  of advanced nutrients.
[16:42.980 --> 16:43.820]  It used to be fun.
[16:43.820 --> 16:46.220]  I felt like the mad scientist looking for the perfect mix.
[16:46.220 --> 16:47.660]  And now I can do it with my organics
[16:47.660 --> 16:48.500]  with the help of you guys.
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.420]  That's how I first started growing was with bottles.
[16:50.420 --> 16:53.640]  And you know, my first grow, I'll admit it.
[16:53.640 --> 16:55.300]  I messed those plants up.
[16:55.300 --> 16:58.580]  I feel so bad and I wish I had went with organics,
[16:58.580 --> 16:59.540]  but I was nervous.
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.980]  But now after actually, you know,
[17:01.980 --> 17:03.900]  practicing it and going hands on
[17:03.900 --> 17:05.540]  and just kind of diving in
[17:05.540 --> 17:07.580]  and after reading a lot of the books, you know,
[17:07.580 --> 17:09.460]  they help, but you get to the end of them
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.580]  and it's like, this is just life
[17:11.580 --> 17:13.420]  and just what, you know, has been happening.
[17:13.420 --> 17:15.940]  And it's what you've learned in science class.
[17:15.940 --> 17:16.780]  It's nothing new.
[17:16.780 --> 17:19.260]  It's just, you know, going a little farther beyond.
[17:19.260 --> 17:22.500]  And that's where like the Korean farming comes into.
[17:22.500 --> 17:24.840]  And you know, that's a little bit more hands on.
[17:24.840 --> 17:26.940]  But once you, you know,
[17:26.940 --> 17:30.060]  start somewhere small with worm castings, you know,
[17:30.060 --> 17:32.460]  that's a big step in your gardening practice.
[17:32.460 --> 17:34.260]  If you're trying to get hardcore into it
[17:34.260 --> 17:36.340]  and you wanna be completely self-sufficient
[17:36.340 --> 17:37.580]  and we can help you do that.
[17:37.580 --> 17:38.420]  I mean, I'm serious.
[17:38.420 --> 17:39.820]  We can help you to where you,
[17:39.820 --> 17:41.300]  you'll never have to go to the hydro store.
[17:41.300 --> 17:42.940]  You'll never have to come to Jay.
[17:42.940 --> 17:46.580]  You'll never have to rely on anybody
[17:46.580 --> 17:47.740]  to grow your own plants.
[17:47.740 --> 17:49.800]  But in order to do that,
[17:49.800 --> 17:51.300]  you're gonna have to start somewhere.
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.140]  Right.
[17:52.140 --> 17:54.340]  And that somewhere is worm castings.
[17:54.340 --> 17:55.780]  Okay, I've jumped in.
[17:55.780 --> 17:56.620]  Exactly.
[17:56.620 --> 17:58.100]  And once you start with that base
[17:58.100 --> 18:00.220]  and then you'll start to understand, you know,
[18:00.220 --> 18:02.780]  okay, this is why I'm mixing it in with the soil.
[18:02.780 --> 18:04.440]  This is what they're doing.
[18:05.420 --> 18:07.420]  A lot of stuff starts to make sense.
[18:07.420 --> 18:08.260]  So you're gonna see like.
[18:08.260 --> 18:10.380]  You see root growth on your plants after you transplant.
[18:10.380 --> 18:11.580]  How beautiful everything looks.
[18:11.580 --> 18:13.260]  Root bags for this run.
[18:13.260 --> 18:15.500]  And they're coming out of the bottoms vigorously.
[18:15.500 --> 18:17.780]  And usually those roots that fall out of the holes like that
[18:17.780 --> 18:19.380]  they die off, but they're still reaching.
[18:19.380 --> 18:20.980]  They're crawling around the room on the floor.
[18:20.980 --> 18:23.140]  Like I can find some more, I'm sure.
[18:23.140 --> 18:24.580]  Like they're stoked about life in there.
[18:24.580 --> 18:25.420]  Yeah.
[18:25.860 --> 18:26.700]  That's it.
[18:26.700 --> 18:27.520]  Yeah.
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.360]  Yep.
[18:28.360 --> 18:29.200]  I got huge roots now.
[18:29.200 --> 18:30.020]  Awesome.
[18:30.020 --> 18:30.860]  Not a bad thing.
[18:30.860 --> 18:31.700]  And they're white.
[18:31.700 --> 18:32.520]  They're super, super white.
[18:32.520 --> 18:33.360]  So glad to hear that.
[18:33.360 --> 18:34.200]  Yeah.
[18:34.200 --> 18:35.020]  Nice and fuzzy.
[18:35.020 --> 18:35.860]  Just a little kashi and a little,
[18:35.860 --> 18:37.580]  two applications of worm castings is really all it is.
[18:37.580 --> 18:39.540]  And don't be afraid to use the worm castings
[18:39.540 --> 18:42.260]  in the soil mixes and you know, when you transplant.
[18:42.260 --> 18:44.500]  10% is what I typically go with.
[18:44.500 --> 18:45.340]  Okay.
[18:45.340 --> 18:46.340]  For my personal.
[18:46.340 --> 18:47.180]  I don't know what you guys.
[18:47.180 --> 18:49.740]  How long does it take for those worm castings
[18:49.740 --> 18:52.200]  to become bioavailable to my plants?
[18:52.440 --> 18:57.320]  I would say theoretically instantaneously.
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.160]  Okay.
[18:58.160 --> 18:59.000]  Yeah.
[18:59.000 --> 18:59.820]  So you're not.
[18:59.820 --> 19:00.660]  There's no breakdown time.
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.500]  There's no MPK.
[19:01.500 --> 19:02.320]  So there is a tip.
[19:02.320 --> 19:04.600]  There is an MPK value, but that's not why you're using them.
[19:04.600 --> 19:06.040]  It's minuscule.
[19:06.040 --> 19:07.080]  So when you're adding them,
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.160]  the reason that you're going to get,
[19:09.160 --> 19:10.560]  I'm not going to say instant results,
[19:10.560 --> 19:13.760]  but results so quick is because when you introduce those,
[19:13.760 --> 19:14.600]  you're not like,
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.560]  it's not like a fertilizer that you're waiting to be absorbed
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.400]  by the root.
[19:18.400 --> 19:19.240]  Exactly.
[19:19.240 --> 19:20.060]  It's life.
[19:20.060 --> 19:22.040]  You just dropped a spaceship in that soil.
[19:22.880 --> 19:24.160]  There are little worms in these worm castings.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.360]  You guys are little tiny baby worms in the package.
[19:26.360 --> 19:28.400]  You may get some worms in your castings.
[19:28.400 --> 19:30.800]  That tells you that that tells me that that shit is alive.
[19:30.800 --> 19:32.120]  If that worm was alive in there,
[19:32.120 --> 19:32.960]  it got shipped.
[19:32.960 --> 19:34.400]  They were packaged in Colorado Springs.
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.220]  As far as I know,
[19:35.220 --> 19:37.480]  I bought it in Pueblo at high grow.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.000]  I had it in my,
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.200]  in my car for a day before I even was able to bring it in
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.040]  the house.
[19:42.040 --> 19:43.560]  Cause you can't haul in all the gross shit during the day.
[19:43.560 --> 19:44.400]  You know,
[19:44.400 --> 19:45.240]  you got to kind of,
[19:45.240 --> 19:46.120]  I will say though,
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.400]  when purchasing worm castings,
[19:48.400 --> 19:50.200]  the first thing you want to do is seal them.
[19:50.200 --> 19:51.840]  You want to put them in a sealed container.
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.480]  Cause they will dry out.
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.320]  And that's,
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.520]  that's one of the worst.
[19:55.520 --> 19:57.280]  You'll waste a lot of money doing that.
[19:57.280 --> 19:59.400]  Cause once they dry out,
[19:59.400 --> 20:01.760]  then they're no better than anything off a store shelf.
[20:01.760 --> 20:03.560]  They're just that package stuff at the store.
[20:03.560 --> 20:04.400]  It's all dusty.
[20:04.400 --> 20:05.880]  And then I can see a difference.
[20:05.880 --> 20:06.720]  No one's bought it.
[20:06.720 --> 20:07.680]  And now someone came in.
[20:07.680 --> 20:08.520]  I like playing with it.
[20:08.520 --> 20:09.360]  You feel it.
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.180]  You smell it.
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.020]  You look at it.
[20:11.020 --> 20:11.840]  I said that on the last episode,
[20:11.840 --> 20:12.680]  I said,
[20:12.680 --> 20:13.520]  they smell so good.
[20:13.520 --> 20:14.340]  You could eat them.
[20:14.340 --> 20:15.180]  I don't think I would,
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.020]  but it's,
[20:16.020 --> 20:16.840]  I said,
[20:16.840 --> 20:17.680]  it smells delicious.
[20:17.680 --> 20:18.520]  And I said that people are going to make,
[20:18.520 --> 20:19.340]  think I'm weird.
[20:19.340 --> 20:20.180]  Cause I said,
[20:20.180 --> 20:21.020]  it smells good,
[20:21.020 --> 20:22.060]  but that's why I grow dirt still.
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.700]  It's cause I love the smell of good dirt.
[20:23.700 --> 20:24.540]  I'm just a dirt warrior.
[20:24.540 --> 20:25.360]  I know they smell great.
[20:25.360 --> 20:27.240]  I'm from the East coast.
[20:27.240 --> 20:29.820]  And when I came to Colorado,
[20:29.820 --> 20:33.460]  it like hurt my soul to not see dirt.
[20:33.460 --> 20:34.300]  You know,
[20:34.300 --> 20:35.120]  just the,
[20:35.120 --> 20:35.960]  it's just.
[20:35.960 --> 20:36.780]  Yeah. East coast.
[20:36.780 --> 20:37.620]  We have loamy soils.
[20:37.620 --> 20:38.460]  Yeah. Okay.
[20:38.460 --> 20:39.280]  Yeah.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.120]  I was going to say there's a lot of dirt here,
[20:40.120 --> 20:40.960]  but we got mountains.
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.780]  Nice coastal,
[20:41.780 --> 20:44.180]  nice coastal loamy soil.
[20:44.180 --> 20:46.180]  A lot of decomposition trees.
[20:46.180 --> 20:48.260]  All that water and vegetation.
[20:48.260 --> 20:49.100]  Yeah.
[20:49.100 --> 20:50.100]  A lot of deciduous forests that,
[20:50.100 --> 20:51.220]  that do not die off.
[20:51.220 --> 20:52.060]  Dust.
[20:52.060 --> 20:52.900]  Yeah.
[20:52.900 --> 20:53.720]  Pueblo.
[20:53.720 --> 20:54.560]  Pueblo dust,
[20:54.560 --> 20:55.400]  clay,
[20:55.400 --> 20:56.220]  I'm sorry.
[20:56.220 --> 20:57.060]  I don't get out of,
[20:57.060 --> 20:58.500]  I haven't been out of Pueblo much here lately.
[20:58.500 --> 20:59.340]  Oh,
[20:59.340 --> 21:00.460]  you got to get in the car and go to Manitou with us one day.
[21:00.460 --> 21:01.540]  We just go on random.
[21:01.540 --> 21:02.380]  Yeah.
[21:02.380 --> 21:03.200]  I take that back.
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.040]  I've been to Denver a lot.
[21:04.040 --> 21:04.880]  I just,
[21:04.880 --> 21:05.940]  I haven't had any time to stop and enjoy it.
[21:05.940 --> 21:07.660]  The best place I've been to was Estes park.
[21:07.660 --> 21:09.060]  And I think that's the closest that was.
[21:09.060 --> 21:09.980]  That's a beautiful place.
[21:09.980 --> 21:10.820]  It's really nice.
[21:10.820 --> 21:11.660]  It's a beautiful place.
[21:11.660 --> 21:12.940]  I am a Manitou junkie though.
[21:12.940 --> 21:13.940]  Anytime I get a chance,
[21:13.940 --> 21:15.500]  it's the Montay factor.
[21:15.500 --> 21:16.540]  Montay factor.
[21:16.540 --> 21:18.260]  And just a little walk on Manitou Avenue.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.340]  Go visit the poppy seed.
[21:19.340 --> 21:21.540]  There's a chiropractor up there that charges a dollar a
[21:21.540 --> 21:22.360]  minute,
[21:22.360 --> 21:23.200]  I think.
[21:23.200 --> 21:24.040]  Yeah.
[21:24.040 --> 21:24.860]  And he'll eat that.
[21:24.860 --> 21:25.700]  Yeah.
[21:25.700 --> 21:26.540]  He's awesome.
[21:26.540 --> 21:27.360]  He pops a,
[21:27.360 --> 21:28.200]  one of my favorite people.
[21:28.200 --> 21:29.040]  He pops her back once a week.
[21:29.040 --> 21:29.860]  We drive up there.
[21:29.860 --> 21:30.700]  I don't know.
[21:30.700 --> 21:31.540]  Maybe train them some workouts.
[21:31.540 --> 21:32.360]  He does.
[21:32.360 --> 21:33.200]  He talks about cool.
[21:33.200 --> 21:34.580]  He knows that we work at a dispensary.
[21:34.580 --> 21:35.580]  Yeah.
[21:35.580 --> 21:37.180]  He knows that that's where his patient works.
[21:37.180 --> 21:38.980]  Big fan of the arcade up there.
[21:38.980 --> 21:39.820]  Yeah.
[21:39.820 --> 21:41.740]  And that is better than when you can just cut loose,
[21:41.740 --> 21:42.580]  man.
[21:42.580 --> 21:43.420]  Shout out to the Manitou Springs.
[21:43.420 --> 21:44.820]  And for people who don't drink,
[21:44.820 --> 21:45.660]  keeping it real.
[21:45.700 --> 21:46.540]  For people who,
[21:46.540 --> 21:47.620]  like who don't do hard drugs.
[21:47.620 --> 21:48.700]  How do we cut loose?
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.300]  We go play penny video games.
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.140]  Yeah.
[21:51.140 --> 21:51.960]  Yeah.
[21:51.960 --> 21:54.700]  What our parents used to do in the day.
[21:54.700 --> 21:55.540]  Right.
[21:55.540 --> 21:57.380]  We are turning into old people.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.300]  I say it every day.
[21:58.300 --> 21:59.140]  I'm like,
[21:59.140 --> 21:59.980]  Oh my gosh.
[21:59.980 --> 22:01.140]  So my back hurts.
[22:01.140 --> 22:02.540]  My knees crack.
[22:02.540 --> 22:05.260]  Remember when you could get up without making sound effects?
[22:05.260 --> 22:06.620]  Every time I walk up the stairs,
[22:06.620 --> 22:07.500]  I'm like crack,
[22:07.500 --> 22:08.340]  crack,
[22:08.340 --> 22:09.160]  crack.
[22:09.160 --> 22:10.620]  I need just joint one in my hand all day.
[22:10.620 --> 22:11.860]  You aren't sneaking up on anybody,
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.700]  bro.
[22:12.700 --> 22:13.540]  Hey,
[22:13.540 --> 22:14.860]  Alan's coming up the stairs.
[22:14.900 --> 22:15.900]  Watch out.
[22:15.900 --> 22:19.020]  So aside from the drag,
[22:19.020 --> 22:19.860]  we go,
[22:19.860 --> 22:20.900]  I'm just trying to stay on track.
[22:20.900 --> 22:21.740]  No,
[22:21.740 --> 22:23.660]  I like to let it go a little bit.
[22:23.660 --> 22:26.220]  It's like jam band music.
[22:26.220 --> 22:27.220]  If you let it go for a minute,
[22:27.220 --> 22:28.580]  some gold may just come out.
[22:28.580 --> 22:29.620]  And if it doesn't after a minute,
[22:29.620 --> 22:30.460]  I'll put you back on track.
[22:30.460 --> 22:31.300]  You cannot,
[22:31.300 --> 22:33.940]  if since you're going to be recycling soil and organics,
[22:33.940 --> 22:35.780]  and you're going to want to stay sustainable,
[22:35.780 --> 22:37.820]  you can put it in your soil bins.
[22:37.820 --> 22:41.180]  When you're recycling your soil to help break down organic
[22:41.180 --> 22:42.220]  to matter in there,
[22:42.220 --> 22:44.100]  as such as leaves and stalks,
[22:44.140 --> 22:44.980]  as I said,
[22:44.980 --> 22:45.820]  roots,
[22:45.820 --> 22:46.640]  root balls,
[22:46.640 --> 22:47.480]  everything,
[22:47.480 --> 22:48.320]  put it in there,
[22:48.320 --> 22:49.140]  put a top layer,
[22:49.140 --> 22:49.980]  mix it in while you're covering it.
[22:49.980 --> 22:50.820]  And you know,
[22:50.820 --> 22:52.260]  the mold is my next step.
[22:52.260 --> 22:55.500]  The mold is as far as I need to contribute mixing Bukashi
[22:55.500 --> 22:56.340]  into your soil.
[22:56.340 --> 22:58.540]  Traditionally it's a 2% by volume.
[22:58.540 --> 22:59.380]  Okay.
[22:59.380 --> 23:01.020]  So two gallons for 200 gallons.
[23:01.020 --> 23:01.860]  Okay.
[23:01.860 --> 23:02.700]  Yeah.
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.520]  That goes a long way.
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.360]  So you,
[23:04.360 --> 23:05.200]  yeah,
[23:05.200 --> 23:06.020]  I mean,
[23:06.020 --> 23:07.420]  you're going to have to build like a trough or something or
[23:07.420 --> 23:09.900]  by a res or something to mix up your soil and you need
[23:09.900 --> 23:11.220]  something a tarp on the ground works,
[23:11.220 --> 23:13.500]  but it's low down and it's hard to go to low.
[23:13.540 --> 23:15.060]  Kitty pools are awesome.
[23:15.060 --> 23:15.880]  There you go.
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.720]  That's a good idea.
[23:16.720 --> 23:19.060]  And then buckets and then store it in buckets.
[23:19.060 --> 23:19.900]  See,
[23:19.900 --> 23:21.180]  they're made containers work really well.
[23:21.180 --> 23:22.300]  Big ass trash cans,
[23:22.300 --> 23:23.260]  27 gallons.
[23:23.260 --> 23:25.420]  When you guys see that white stuff growing on your soil,
[23:25.420 --> 23:26.260]  don't freak out.
[23:26.260 --> 23:27.080]  That's good.
[23:27.080 --> 23:27.920]  That's what you're aiming for.
[23:27.920 --> 23:30.340]  I've seen people open it up and see that white growth and
[23:30.340 --> 23:31.180]  throw their shit away.
[23:31.180 --> 23:32.020]  Don't do that.
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.260]  So it makes your soil,
[23:33.260 --> 23:34.660]  grab some grow Kashi,
[23:34.660 --> 23:35.500]  you know,
[23:35.500 --> 23:36.340]  it makes it.
[23:36.340 --> 23:37.160]  So if you're going to reamend your soil,
[23:37.160 --> 23:38.860]  make sure grow Kashi and put your amendments in there.
[23:38.860 --> 23:39.700]  Like you were saying,
[23:39.700 --> 23:40.900]  mix it up in a,
[23:40.900 --> 23:41.740]  you know,
[23:41.740 --> 23:43.060]  kitty pool or on a tarp,
[23:43.580 --> 23:45.380]  put them up in a rubber made container.
[23:45.380 --> 23:49.740]  And then what I would recommend doing is swinging by J's and
[23:49.740 --> 23:52.660]  picking up either cocoons,
[23:52.660 --> 23:54.020]  or if you really want to,
[23:54.020 --> 23:55.300]  like it's a lot of fun,
[23:55.300 --> 24:00.020]  but live worms and throw them in there and just let them go
[24:00.020 --> 24:00.860]  to town.
[24:00.860 --> 24:04.560]  Cause either they're gonna die or they're going to survive.
[24:04.560 --> 24:05.740]  They self populate.
[24:05.740 --> 24:07.100]  So they'll either get in there.
[24:07.100 --> 24:08.100]  They'll do well.
[24:08.100 --> 24:11.700]  If your soil is optimal and is running how it should,
[24:11.700 --> 24:15.420]  your worms will reproduce and you will have,
[24:15.420 --> 24:16.260]  you know,
[24:16.260 --> 24:18.660]  an active soil food web and they do help.
[24:18.660 --> 24:21.980]  But I know Sean's had experience with them kind of over
[24:21.980 --> 24:23.820]  flirting the plant with breaking down.
[24:23.820 --> 24:24.660]  Yeah.
[24:24.660 --> 24:25.500]  They find hot spots.
[24:25.500 --> 24:26.320]  So if you mix your,
[24:26.320 --> 24:28.460]  so let's say that she makes your soil and you're like,
[24:28.460 --> 24:29.300]  dang,
[24:29.300 --> 24:30.340]  I don't know if I did that good enough.
[24:30.340 --> 24:31.460]  Didn't stir that one spot,
[24:31.460 --> 24:32.300]  right?
[24:32.300 --> 24:33.120]  Throw some worms in there.
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.740]  And they tend to like find hot spots and they'll work their
[24:36.740 --> 24:37.580]  way through it.
[24:37.580 --> 24:38.420]  And they tend to break it up.
[24:38.420 --> 24:39.260]  But yeah,
[24:39.260 --> 24:41.580]  actually I was running a,
[24:42.460 --> 24:44.340]  I went into one of my rooms and saw some test plants with a
[24:44.340 --> 24:46.060]  little bit of nitrogen toxicity.
[24:46.060 --> 24:48.300]  And so the tips of the leaves were kind of pointing at the
[24:48.300 --> 24:50.220]  ground and they were a little dark green.
[24:50.220 --> 24:51.420]  I was like,
[24:51.420 --> 24:52.260]  this is weird.
[24:52.260 --> 24:53.500]  I don't feed them anything.
[24:53.500 --> 24:55.500]  How is this happening?
[24:55.500 --> 25:00.500]  So it was actually a alfalfa hay that I mulch or that I used
[25:00.500 --> 25:02.060]  to mulch with.
[25:02.060 --> 25:06.220]  But the worms went crazy and it started just eating the shit
[25:06.220 --> 25:07.060]  out of it.
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.500]  And I guess they cycled it and it burnt my plant.
[25:10.500 --> 25:11.820]  It didn't burn my plant,
[25:11.820 --> 25:14.060]  but it was taking up a lot of it.
[25:14.060 --> 25:14.900]  Yeah.
[25:14.900 --> 25:15.740]  I mean,
[25:15.740 --> 25:16.560]  it was,
[25:16.560 --> 25:17.400]  it was pretty amazing.
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.220]  So it really kind of,
[25:18.220 --> 25:19.060]  you can kind of overdo it with organics as well.
[25:19.060 --> 25:19.900]  Yeah.
[25:19.900 --> 25:20.720]  I mean,
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.560]  you don't,
[25:21.560 --> 25:22.380]  you really want to be less as more with organics.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.220]  You want to,
[25:23.220 --> 25:25.900]  you got to know what breaks down in what fashion and how
[25:25.900 --> 25:28.020]  long it takes to break down and,
[25:28.020 --> 25:28.860]  you know,
[25:28.860 --> 25:29.860]  knowing your plant,
[25:29.860 --> 25:30.700]  don't,
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.780]  don't run one plant,
[25:31.780 --> 25:35.140]  one cycle in organics and give up because you,
[25:35.140 --> 25:36.540]  you want to dial that in and it's,
[25:36.540 --> 25:37.900]  it might take one or two runs,
[25:37.900 --> 25:39.020]  but that's the beginning.
[25:39.020 --> 25:39.860]  You know,
[25:39.980 --> 25:40.800]  yeah,
[25:40.800 --> 25:41.640]  you got to start somewhere.
[25:41.640 --> 25:43.820]  And then whatever your best friend told you to mix your
[25:43.820 --> 25:44.660]  soil at,
[25:44.660 --> 25:48.300]  do it at half that rate because it's way easier to fix the
[25:48.300 --> 25:51.500]  deficiency than this to flush out some sort of something
[25:51.500 --> 25:52.980]  that you put in there way too high.
[25:52.980 --> 25:55.260]  For science does not work all the time.
[25:55.260 --> 25:58.820]  So do you carry any sort of dehydrated coconut water?
[25:58.820 --> 25:59.660]  Yes.
[25:59.660 --> 26:00.500]  Well,
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.460]  I don't want to say yes.
[26:01.460 --> 26:03.740]  So we've been working really hard.
[26:03.740 --> 26:05.780]  We kind of revamping inventory.
[26:05.780 --> 26:08.100]  We're carrying soon.
[26:08.100 --> 26:09.560]  We'll be a cover crops.
[26:10.260 --> 26:11.080]  We'll be available.
[26:11.080 --> 26:12.160]  All amendments will be available.
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.000]  Yeah.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.720]  We'll have herbal inoculants.
[26:14.720 --> 26:16.040]  So not just,
[26:16.040 --> 26:18.000]  we'll be able to offer things like alfalfa meal,
[26:18.000 --> 26:18.840]  crustacean meal,
[26:18.840 --> 26:19.680]  oyster shell powder,
[26:19.680 --> 26:20.520]  kelp meal.
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.340]  It's all food grade.
[26:21.340 --> 26:22.180]  It's all organic,
[26:22.180 --> 26:25.680]  but we'll also be carrying a aloe vera powder,
[26:25.680 --> 26:26.760]  free coconut powder.
[26:26.760 --> 26:28.000]  This is all organic,
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.080]  cold processed.
[26:30.080 --> 26:30.920]  You know,
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.680]  it's of the highest quality.
[26:32.680 --> 26:35.160]  We'll also be starting to carry a,
[26:35.160 --> 26:36.000]  I don't know.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.240]  I don't know if we can grind the herbs.
[26:37.240 --> 26:38.200]  Can we start saying that?
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.280]  Can we say that we're going to start powderizing our own
[26:40.280 --> 26:41.120]  herbs?
[26:41.120 --> 26:43.560]  Rocky mountain worm company in the next few months is
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.200]  definitely going to be changing a face.
[26:47.200 --> 26:48.980]  Nothing is set in stone yet.
[26:48.980 --> 26:50.600]  So I won't say anything definite,
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.320]  but the community is definitely going to have a lot more
[26:54.320 --> 26:57.120]  things available to them for their organic needs.
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.080]  So just keep an eye out,
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.400]  follow our Instagram,
[27:00.400 --> 27:01.240]  Rocky mountain worm company.
[27:01.240 --> 27:03.560]  How about some sort of like a feed chart or something to go
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.880]  with all the goodies you're offering.
[27:04.880 --> 27:05.880]  Is that available yet?
[27:05.880 --> 27:06.800]  Not yet.
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.320]  So basically we're trying to work out inventory first before
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.960]  we tell you what to use and not have it for you to use.
[27:14.960 --> 27:15.800]  That's a good idea.
[27:15.800 --> 27:16.620]  So yeah,
[27:16.620 --> 27:20.560]  we're really working on inventory right now where we've
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.200]  worked it out a couple of times,
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.080]  a couple of the products that we were had on our rock,
[27:25.080 --> 27:27.600]  we call it at the Rocky mountain natural farming schedule.
[27:27.600 --> 27:30.000]  A couple of things that we had on there initially are a
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.320]  little harder to source.
[27:31.320 --> 27:34.140]  And I don't think that we'll be able to keep the regiment up
[27:34.140 --> 27:35.920]  if people actually pick it on.
[27:35.920 --> 27:38.640]  So we're trying to make sure that if that occasion does
[27:38.640 --> 27:40.240]  happen, like I was saying, I mean,
[27:40.240 --> 27:43.120]  I guess we can say he already bought the damn grinder.
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.920]  So we're going to start powderizing our own herbs.
[27:45.920 --> 27:47.360]  Even if we don't start selling them,
[27:47.360 --> 27:48.200]  we'll start doing,
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.600]  we're going to start doing experiments of powderizing our
[27:50.600 --> 27:52.900]  own yarrow and alfalfa and stuff.
[27:52.900 --> 27:54.200]  But we will have,
[27:54.200 --> 27:57.400]  I would say April is going to be,
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.000]  is the big kickoff date.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.720]  We'll be at the cannabis cup some fashion.
[28:01.720 --> 28:03.480]  So you can't miss me with the beard.
[28:03.480 --> 28:04.880]  Come find me.
[28:04.880 --> 28:05.720]  It's Colorado, bro.
[28:06.520 --> 28:07.360]  There's a lot of beard.
[28:07.360 --> 28:08.180]  You can't trust me.
[28:08.180 --> 28:09.960]  I'll I'll have some type of hat on.
[28:09.960 --> 28:11.720]  And if I don't have my BMO hat on
[28:11.720 --> 28:14.800]  and then Rocky mountain worm company will be a, yeah,
[28:14.800 --> 28:15.960]  there'll be getting a booth.
[28:15.960 --> 28:19.560]  So, and then potentially around that time,
[28:19.560 --> 28:22.520]  they'll have some new info that they want to release.
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.440]  As far as like I said,
[28:23.440 --> 28:24.680]  us carrying a new product,
[28:24.680 --> 28:26.680]  us releasing feeding charts.
[28:26.680 --> 28:28.780]  There's going to be a lot of stuff out.
[28:28.780 --> 28:30.280]  So you can come and catch us at the cup.
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.000]  If you come by the Rocky mountain worm company booth guys,
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.560]  because I will be hanging out.
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.160]  We're going to schedule probably a good two hour block.
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.240]  Each day, the day, the cup is three days.
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.040]  I'll probably pick two hours at it.
[28:41.040 --> 28:42.920]  I'll try to do different times or maybe the same time.
[28:42.920 --> 28:43.760]  I don't know.
[28:43.760 --> 28:44.760]  I want to be able to meet as many people as I can,
[28:44.760 --> 28:46.120]  but that's a landmark for me to go.
[28:46.120 --> 28:46.960]  Yeah.
[28:46.960 --> 28:47.800]  Let them know.
[28:47.800 --> 28:49.920]  We'll try to come back on here one more time.
[28:49.920 --> 28:51.440]  But in the meantime, we got plenty of time.
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.280]  Oh yeah.
[28:52.280 --> 28:54.400]  Let Jeff know when you want them there.
[28:54.400 --> 28:55.240]  Yeah.
[28:55.240 --> 28:58.040]  Tell me, be like, dude, noon to two or like, well,
[28:58.040 --> 28:59.300]  it's I got to get into the cup.
[28:59.300 --> 29:01.560]  You got to stand in line for three hours before we can even
[29:01.560 --> 29:02.400]  get in.
[29:02.400 --> 29:03.220]  So after I get in the cup,
[29:03.220 --> 29:04.060]  I'll just go to your guys's booth.
[29:04.580 --> 29:05.420]  I'll just come find us.
[29:05.420 --> 29:06.660]  You're going to need a place to sit down.
[29:06.660 --> 29:07.500]  Dab out.
[29:07.500 --> 29:08.500]  I'll have some water for you.
[29:08.500 --> 29:09.320]  Yeah.
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.160]  Yeah.
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.060]  Dude, I started partying in the line last year.
[29:11.060 --> 29:11.900]  It was so much fun.
[29:11.900 --> 29:13.700]  I got out of the dab rig and started dabbing people out in
[29:13.700 --> 29:15.540]  line and the cops were standing there just looking at us
[29:15.540 --> 29:16.820]  like, well, okay.
[29:16.820 --> 29:19.020]  You got to just got to celebrate.
[29:19.020 --> 29:19.860]  It's a big thing.
[29:19.860 --> 29:20.740]  And it was 420.
[29:20.740 --> 29:21.580]  Yeah.
[29:21.580 --> 29:22.420]  Exactly.
[29:22.420 --> 29:23.240]  Yeah.
[29:23.240 --> 29:25.200]  The booth will potentially have some really cool stuff.
[29:25.200 --> 29:26.120]  We'll be able to,
[29:26.120 --> 29:28.540]  we'll have some example containers of all of our cover
[29:28.540 --> 29:29.380]  crops.
[29:29.380 --> 29:31.100]  We'll have example of all of the amendments and things.
[29:31.100 --> 29:32.580]  I'll have some flowers there.
[29:32.580 --> 29:33.420]  Yeah.
[29:34.100 --> 29:36.220]  We'll have plenty of flower.
[29:36.220 --> 29:37.060]  Yeah.
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.980]  This has been one of the stoniest episodes we've recorded.
[29:38.980 --> 29:41.260]  There has been a joint burning the entire show.
[29:41.260 --> 29:42.740]  These guys are rolling up cones.
[29:42.740 --> 29:43.980]  We're about to light up another one.
[29:43.980 --> 29:47.380]  That's one is the homegrown using the Rocky mountain worm
[29:47.380 --> 29:48.220]  castings.
[29:48.220 --> 29:49.340]  Nice.
[29:49.340 --> 29:51.340]  This is everything you guys show up with showed up with
[29:51.340 --> 29:53.060]  smells and looks and tastes delicious.
[29:53.060 --> 29:55.060]  We try to keep it, you know,
[29:55.060 --> 29:57.820]  keep it connoisseur quality and what you know,
[29:57.820 --> 29:59.060]  you should be smoking.
[29:59.060 --> 30:00.300]  I kind of cut you off a minute ago.
[30:00.300 --> 30:02.700]  You were about to hype out the Instagram for Rocky mountain
[30:03.220 --> 30:04.060]  worm company.
[30:04.060 --> 30:05.340]  Tell us how we can find the worm company and stuff.
[30:05.340 --> 30:06.660]  And we'll do that again at the end of the show too.
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.420]  But since you were almost there, I want to let you do it.
[30:08.420 --> 30:13.420]  It's Rocky mountain worm co it Rocky and then MTN worm CO,
[30:15.140 --> 30:19.140]  or you can check Sean out on Rocky mountain natural farming.
[30:19.140 --> 30:22.900]  I know there's a little, what's that called?
[30:22.900 --> 30:23.740]  Underscore.
[30:23.740 --> 30:24.580]  Yeah.
[30:24.580 --> 30:25.420]  Rocky,
[30:25.420 --> 30:26.260]  Rocky,
[30:26.260 --> 30:30.380]  MTN underscore natural farming or a King underscore Cola
[30:30.380 --> 30:31.220]  underscore.
[30:32.140 --> 30:33.660]  What we'll work a link out.
[30:33.660 --> 30:35.540]  So you can just find all of us after the show.
[30:35.540 --> 30:37.620]  When I post up a, when this episode goes out,
[30:37.620 --> 30:40.380]  I'll try to post up all of those in the listing with the
[30:40.380 --> 30:42.300]  show I post up to Instagram and Twitter and all that.
[30:42.300 --> 30:44.140]  So hopefully people will find you and follow you.
[30:44.140 --> 30:44.980]  Yeah.
[30:44.980 --> 30:45.820]  I don't have any parchment paper,
[30:45.820 --> 30:47.540]  but he wants a little fingerprint,
[30:47.540 --> 30:48.900]  fingerprint dab.
[30:48.900 --> 30:50.380]  We want to keep it real organic in here.
[30:50.380 --> 30:51.940]  I'll take a fingerprint dab.
[30:51.940 --> 30:52.780]  Why not?
[30:52.780 --> 30:53.620]  I ain't scared.
[30:53.620 --> 30:54.460]  We're bros.
[30:56.900 --> 30:58.620]  That stuff smells delicious.
[30:58.620 --> 30:59.460]  Yeah.
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.980]  That smells like some turkeys.
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.900]  Shout out to jibs and Ken from THE.
[31:04.900 --> 31:05.740]  Yeah.
[31:05.740 --> 31:06.580]  Jibs is an awesome dude.
[31:06.580 --> 31:07.420]  Yeah.
[31:07.420 --> 31:08.460]  They're out at the, Oh yeah.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.420]  Shout out at they just won second place at the cup.
[31:10.420 --> 31:11.260]  Yeah,
[31:11.260 --> 31:12.100]  man.
[31:12.100 --> 31:16.900]  And they'll be at the Denver cup for sure.
[31:16.900 --> 31:19.300]  I know that there'll be running some more of growing Kush
[31:19.300 --> 31:22.860]  one mile high stuff and he will be stopping by the worm
[31:22.860 --> 31:24.460]  company booth also.
[31:24.460 --> 31:26.100]  We'll, we'll come back with that.
[31:26.100 --> 31:28.500]  We're going to schedule hopefully some times for you guys to
[31:28.500 --> 31:30.820]  come by and meet some of your favorite growers and stand
[31:31.660 --> 31:32.500]  at the booth.
[31:32.500 --> 31:33.620]  There's going to be a lot of people in Denver,
[31:33.620 --> 31:35.740]  so it's going to be a real interesting weekend.
[31:35.740 --> 31:37.180]  Growing Kush one mile high, bro.
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.540]  Get in touch with me.
[31:38.540 --> 31:39.380]  Yeah.
[31:39.380 --> 31:41.580]  We'll have to try to talk to Jeff here one day, man.
[31:41.580 --> 31:42.420]  Yeah.
[31:42.420 --> 31:43.940]  The dirty low.
[31:43.940 --> 31:47.060]  You can meet us in Colorado Springs and mob down with us.
[31:47.060 --> 31:48.220]  There we go.
[31:48.220 --> 31:49.540]  I just got a gift for him.
[31:49.540 --> 31:51.900]  Oh, see, that's even more of an incentive.
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.820]  Gifts are always worth the drive.
[31:53.820 --> 31:55.740]  Speaking of gifts, I have to reach for a business card.
[31:55.740 --> 31:56.620]  Where did I put that business?
[31:56.620 --> 31:57.660]  I'm going to let you do it, bro.
[31:57.660 --> 31:59.420]  These are the kind of guests on the show.
[31:59.460 --> 32:01.700]  My new friend died to write down his name because I totally
[32:01.700 --> 32:03.420]  expected Jay and I wanted to call him Jay all day.
[32:03.420 --> 32:04.260]  His name is Nick.
[32:04.260 --> 32:05.140]  You guys, his name is Nick.
[32:05.140 --> 32:07.420]  He brought me a killer.
[32:07.420 --> 32:08.260]  It's a wire wrap.
[32:08.260 --> 32:09.620]  If you're a hippie, if you're a woke dude,
[32:09.620 --> 32:11.060]  this is the most killer wire wrap.
[32:11.060 --> 32:13.300]  It's some, I cannot identify the Jasper.
[32:13.300 --> 32:14.140]  I'm sure it's Jasper.
[32:14.140 --> 32:16.540]  It's a red, yellow Jasper, Picasso, Jasper.
[32:16.540 --> 32:17.420]  I'll remember that.
[32:17.420 --> 32:19.300]  Cause I'll remember the artist Picasso.
[32:19.300 --> 32:21.100]  It's red, yellow, and green Jasper wrapped
[32:21.100 --> 32:22.700]  in a really sweet wrap.
[32:22.700 --> 32:24.060]  I've never seen a wrap that style.
[32:24.060 --> 32:25.300]  It is dope.
[32:25.300 --> 32:27.580]  It is from clear sky creations.
[32:27.580 --> 32:29.060]  Check them out on Etsy.
[32:29.700 --> 32:30.540]  Can I say the artist's real name?
[32:30.540 --> 32:31.380]  It's on the card.
[32:31.380 --> 32:32.220]  Oh yeah, go for it.
[32:32.220 --> 32:33.260]  Is it Elise?
[32:33.260 --> 32:34.100]  Yeah.
[32:34.100 --> 32:34.940]  Okay.
[32:34.940 --> 32:35.780]  Check out this artist, Elise.
[32:35.780 --> 32:36.620]  Dude, Elise, thank you.
[32:36.620 --> 32:37.900]  I am wearing this with pride.
[32:37.900 --> 32:39.980]  Yeah, I think everybody in the crew's got like four.
[32:39.980 --> 32:42.220]  Yeah, everybody's got it, bro.
[32:42.220 --> 32:43.060]  It's a thing now.
[32:43.060 --> 32:46.900]  And I think all of us all have links to her on our Instagram
[32:46.900 --> 32:47.900]  if you scroll through.
[32:47.900 --> 32:48.740]  We've all got shots of her.
[32:48.740 --> 32:50.620]  Go through our pages, you know, check our stuff out.
[32:50.620 --> 32:52.900]  We put a lot of posts of what we're doing
[32:52.900 --> 32:54.140]  and how we're doing it.
[32:54.140 --> 32:57.180]  You know, we're not hiding anything from anybody.
[32:57.220 --> 33:00.020]  This isn't, you know, nothing that isn't already available.
[33:00.020 --> 33:01.740]  So why not tell someone how to do it
[33:01.740 --> 33:03.700]  as long as they're willing to learn?
[33:03.700 --> 33:07.420]  But you know, just check our stuff out and we're community.
[33:07.420 --> 33:09.460]  All right, it's time for this fingerprint dab.
[33:09.460 --> 33:10.620]  It smells fingerprinty.
[33:11.740 --> 33:12.700]  They get you like 10 times.
[33:12.700 --> 33:14.100]  I have to ask a question now
[33:14.100 --> 33:17.100]  so that somebody will talk while I dab this.
[33:17.100 --> 33:19.420]  I wanna know about, I wanna start a compost bin
[33:19.420 --> 33:21.740]  and I've got some worm castings now.
[33:21.740 --> 33:23.860]  And I don't have, obviously I live in the city.
[33:23.860 --> 33:24.740]  I don't have a lot of space.
[33:24.740 --> 33:25.860]  I wanted to use that little space
[33:25.860 --> 33:28.340]  right over there by the trash can maybe.
[33:28.340 --> 33:30.300]  Could you guys help me start my own little compost bin?
[33:30.300 --> 33:31.140]  Like that?
[33:31.140 --> 33:33.100]  Yes, we'll get you a bucotte.
[33:33.100 --> 33:34.420]  As far, I'll tell you what,
[33:34.420 --> 33:37.620]  as far as our first sponsorship agreement,
[33:37.620 --> 33:39.740]  I'll bring you down a bucotte bucket.
[33:39.740 --> 33:41.980]  So we'll start you some anaerobic compost
[33:41.980 --> 33:46.660]  and then we'll also get you set up on a actual compost pile
[33:46.660 --> 33:49.020]  for more of a traditional system.
[33:49.020 --> 33:51.780]  So you can finally start to recycle all your, you know,
[33:51.780 --> 33:54.700]  leftover avocados, your banana peels, eggshells,
[33:54.700 --> 33:55.540]  everything like that.
[33:55.540 --> 33:57.860]  And you, you're vegan, correct?
[33:57.860 --> 33:58.940]  Not vegan, but vegetarian.
[33:58.940 --> 34:02.220]  Vegetarian, so the worm castings are vegetarians as well,
[34:02.220 --> 34:03.660]  besides the minerals that they eat.
[34:03.660 --> 34:05.900]  So people that are worried about that,
[34:05.900 --> 34:08.380]  don't be afraid to put it in your garden.
[34:08.380 --> 34:09.220]  Right on.
[34:09.220 --> 34:11.100]  Yeah, definitely, that's important nowadays, I know.
[34:11.100 --> 34:12.940]  So shout out to all the vegans.
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.300]  Sorry guys, I was off mic for a second
[34:14.300 --> 34:16.220]  taking one of these delicious dabs.
[34:16.220 --> 34:18.260]  I kinda wanna trim the nail up to make it burn better,
[34:18.260 --> 34:20.340]  but I wanna turn it down to make it taste better.
[34:20.340 --> 34:22.260]  It's such a toss up.
[34:22.260 --> 34:23.980]  I forgot there's a slogan they have for that,
[34:24.300 --> 34:25.700]  waste it to taste it.
[34:25.700 --> 34:27.140]  Gotta waste it to taste it.
[34:27.140 --> 34:29.100]  I'm not a dabber, I'm a flower guy, so.
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.460]  They hate us cause they ain't us.
[34:30.460 --> 34:32.900]  Peanut butter and jealous.
[34:33.820 --> 34:35.620]  Yeah, yeah, shout out to my friend
[34:35.620 --> 34:38.100]  that watched that movie with me twice this week.
[34:39.420 --> 34:42.820]  Shout out to the interview, James Franco and Seth Rogen.
[34:42.820 --> 34:43.900]  They killed that movie.
[34:43.900 --> 34:45.040]  You know, for the first few minutes,
[34:45.040 --> 34:46.180]  I wanted to smack Franco.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.980]  I was like, oh, he's gonna ruin this movie.
[34:47.980 --> 34:50.140]  But then like the director must've pulled him aside
[34:50.140 --> 34:51.660]  and been like, tone it down to seven.
[34:51.660 --> 34:53.460]  You're on 11, let's just go to seven.
[34:53.900 --> 34:57.260]  I think now you just gotta let that man do what he does.
[34:57.260 --> 35:00.340]  Cause he, if no one's watched Freaks and Geeks,
[35:00.340 --> 35:01.540]  it's an older show.
[35:01.540 --> 35:04.220]  You know, I'm not too old cause we're not that old here.
[35:04.220 --> 35:06.980]  But it's a great show, check that out.
[35:06.980 --> 35:08.580]  It's old school Franco.
[35:08.580 --> 35:11.100]  I've never seen an actor spit so much in a scene before.
[35:11.100 --> 35:12.780]  He's got weird random.
[35:12.780 --> 35:14.540]  That was the movie though, you know?
[35:14.540 --> 35:17.100]  Just like they perfectly did
[35:17.100 --> 35:18.740]  the Lord of the Rings references.
[35:18.740 --> 35:19.740]  Beautifully.
[35:19.740 --> 35:22.320]  On King, that was needed in that movie.
[35:22.840 --> 35:24.800]  That was just a beautiful movie.
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.520]  So I was glad that Netflix put that on there.
[35:28.420 --> 35:30.040]  So like a Bokashi bucket?
[35:30.040 --> 35:31.720]  Yeah, so we'll get you a Bokashi bucket.
[35:31.720 --> 35:34.720]  We'll start you with an anaerobic compost
[35:34.720 --> 35:37.480]  so we can start recycling all of your kitchen scrap.
[35:38.800 --> 35:41.800]  And then as far as your plant waste,
[35:41.800 --> 35:43.040]  Navigate the maze.
[35:43.040 --> 35:44.460]  Different materials like that.
[35:44.460 --> 35:47.920]  We can also show you how to recycle those.
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.400]  Basically what I would recommend doing would be,
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.680]  so you wanna start a compost bin.
[35:54.680 --> 35:57.000]  Take a leftover pot from last season,
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.120]  start out with a nice soil base.
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.440]  Just dump it in there.
[36:00.440 --> 36:03.480]  And then just feel free to start adding stuff.
[36:03.480 --> 36:05.020]  Throw stuff in there.
[36:05.020 --> 36:08.320]  I keep a bucket, like a five gallon bucket in my back door
[36:08.320 --> 36:10.880]  and I'll just throw things into it.
[36:10.880 --> 36:13.340]  And then every couple of days I'll walk that out
[36:13.340 --> 36:16.120]  to the actual compost pile in my backyard.
[36:16.120 --> 36:19.040]  And then dump that in there, throw some worm cast.
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.800]  Typically I do, for like five gallon bucket full,
[36:22.800 --> 36:24.880]  I'll do like a handful of worm castings.
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.040]  And then the secret is brewer's yeast.
[36:30.280 --> 36:33.400]  So you throw brewer's yeast onto the pile.
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.280]  And then if you really want to, Bokashi grain.
[36:36.280 --> 36:40.240]  Yeah, if you look at, what is it?
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.280]  Buena Tea, the company, their compost accelerator
[36:44.280 --> 36:48.620]  is like a worm castings kelp and brewer's yeast.
[36:49.440 --> 36:51.920]  Yeah, you'd be amazed what you can find out.
[36:51.920 --> 36:53.480]  They're like, how do you know all this stuff?
[36:53.480 --> 36:55.520]  It's like, well, if you turn the bottle around.
[36:55.520 --> 36:57.360]  Yeah, just read the back.
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.680]  Read what's going on, don't be afraid.
[36:59.680 --> 37:00.520]  You know?
[37:00.520 --> 37:01.800]  And then if it says it and you're like,
[37:01.800 --> 37:04.360]  wait, kelp, brewer's yeast, alfalfa,
[37:04.360 --> 37:05.200]  all of this stuff I see at the store.
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.400]  I get that at natural grocers.
[37:06.400 --> 37:07.480]  Then go and buy it.
[37:07.480 --> 37:09.880]  Yeah, yucca extract, molasses.
[37:09.880 --> 37:10.720]  You can take that shit up.
[37:10.720 --> 37:12.200]  Try to source it from somewhere
[37:12.200 --> 37:14.560]  that is sourcing it naturally,
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.180]  whether they grow it sustainably
[37:16.180 --> 37:17.940]  or they've been growing it for a while.
[37:17.980 --> 37:20.580]  You might not be able to get it from where you are,
[37:21.760 --> 37:23.740]  but someone is making it somewhere.
[37:23.740 --> 37:26.860]  And if you want it, it might be a little bit to get.
[37:26.860 --> 37:28.700]  If you can't find it, you're not looking hard enough.
[37:28.700 --> 37:29.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:29.540 --> 37:30.360]  It's somewhere.
[37:30.360 --> 37:31.200]  Somebody's been doing it.
[37:31.200 --> 37:32.040]  We've got the internet.
[37:32.040 --> 37:32.860]  Craigslist, man.
[37:32.860 --> 37:33.700]  Yeah, Google.
[37:33.700 --> 37:37.620]  Backwoods, those people are your friends now.
[37:37.620 --> 37:40.480]  If you want barley straw, you want hay,
[37:40.480 --> 37:43.420]  you want manures, you want compost,
[37:43.420 --> 37:44.260]  you want any of those things.
[37:44.260 --> 37:45.620]  Find someone that's feeding their.
[37:45.620 --> 37:46.460]  People are looking.
[37:46.460 --> 37:48.500]  If you don't want Craigslist, people wanna get rid of it.
[37:48.500 --> 37:50.540]  They'll pay you to come and get it the hell out of there.
[37:50.540 --> 37:51.380]  Yeah, right.
[37:51.380 --> 37:52.200]  Come clean up my shit.
[37:52.200 --> 37:53.260]  That's how I got all of my alfalfa hay.
[37:53.260 --> 37:57.420]  It was the guy had to scrape his horse pins.
[37:57.420 --> 37:58.780]  I don't know if you're familiar with horses,
[37:58.780 --> 38:01.620]  but they scrape the pins and I went and collected that.
[38:01.620 --> 38:04.420]  So I got a lot of the alfalfa hay that I ran
[38:04.420 --> 38:05.460]  at my last grow.
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.300]  Nice.
[38:06.300 --> 38:07.380]  So it got repurposed.
[38:07.380 --> 38:08.860]  It didn't get thrown in a landfill
[38:08.860 --> 38:10.140]  and it got to grow some great cannabis.
[38:10.140 --> 38:10.980]  It wasn't wasted.
[38:10.980 --> 38:14.060]  Yeah, last grow, I was really motivated
[38:14.060 --> 38:16.100]  to make all of my own nutrients.
[38:17.180 --> 38:18.860]  Really motivated.
[38:18.860 --> 38:21.620]  So I learned how to kind of source it from everywhere
[38:21.620 --> 38:22.700]  for just about free.
[38:22.700 --> 38:25.180]  You've kind of murdered yourself trying to be so motivated.
[38:25.180 --> 38:26.460]  Did you sell yourself down?
[38:26.460 --> 38:29.220]  That means that basically all I had to pay for
[38:29.220 --> 38:30.620]  last grow was power.
[38:30.620 --> 38:31.780]  I didn't have any other money.
[38:31.780 --> 38:32.620]  Nice.
[38:32.620 --> 38:33.540]  So that's helpful.
[38:33.540 --> 38:34.780]  It was, it was, you know.
[38:34.780 --> 38:36.060]  Organics keeps your pocket.
[38:36.060 --> 38:38.220]  Yeah, the past, I'm not gonna lie,
[38:38.220 --> 38:40.060]  the past like half a year has been a little rough
[38:40.060 --> 38:42.700]  and I didn't have all the money to really do
[38:42.700 --> 38:43.540]  what we wanted to.
[38:43.540 --> 38:45.920]  So it was, let's buy fruits.
[38:46.360 --> 38:48.160]  Let's take the cores and the skins and the pits
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.960]  and let's make a plant juice out of it.
[38:50.960 --> 38:53.520]  And it's like, oh, I can grow micro greens
[38:53.520 --> 38:56.440]  and peas and sprouts and I can eat them in my sandwiches,
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.840]  but I can also ferment them and use them
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.320]  as a tea additive or a foliar spray.
[39:01.320 --> 39:02.600]  The same thing with my eggs.
[39:02.600 --> 39:04.440]  Like I'm buying eggs from the store.
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.140]  I'm gonna save my eggshells because I can use that
[39:08.140 --> 39:10.520]  with apple cider vinegar, which I'm already buying
[39:10.520 --> 39:13.120]  because I drink it for health reasons.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.040]  Wash my dreadlocks with it.
[39:14.040 --> 39:16.200]  Yeah, so you just mix that.
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.720]  So you brown eggshell, crush them up,
[39:17.720 --> 39:19.920]  brown some eggshells, mix it with apple cider vinegar,
[39:19.920 --> 39:21.400]  water soluble calcium.
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.600]  So you can make everything in your grow with nothing.
[39:25.600 --> 39:28.200]  And if you've done it, it's easy.
[39:28.200 --> 39:29.880]  Just gotta learn where it comes from, what it is.
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.360]  Learn where nature would have provided it.
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.000]  Go by the Oriental, if you're hungry and you need,
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.240]  so if you and your plants are hungry in the same,
[39:36.240 --> 39:38.280]  at the same time, what I recommend doing
[39:38.280 --> 39:40.160]  is cruising on down to your local Asian market
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.000]  and grabbing you some black fish, the darker, the better.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.480]  I don't know the exact reason, but I would just go with it.
[39:47.320 --> 39:48.160]  So yeah, you go and get you some.
[39:48.160 --> 39:49.000]  They eat better.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.240]  That's what Dr. Chow said.
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.720]  I mean, you gotta, you just gotta go with it.
[39:51.720 --> 39:54.600]  He's kind of the founder of natural farming.
[39:54.600 --> 39:55.440]  Okay, cool dude.
[39:55.440 --> 39:57.040]  But yeah, so you can take some,
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.500]  so yeah, literally go and buy you some fish, clean it,
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.760]  eat what you want, whatever's left over, blend it,
[40:05.760 --> 40:08.200]  typically with like a brown sugar,
[40:08.200 --> 40:09.440]  blend it all up together.
[40:09.440 --> 40:10.280]  That's important.
[40:10.280 --> 40:11.280]  And then seal it.
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.360]  And 30 days, strain it, add a IMO,
[40:16.640 --> 40:19.680]  which is an indigenous microorganisms,
[40:19.680 --> 40:22.080]  or EM1 or lactic acid bacteria.
[40:22.080 --> 40:24.480]  Any of those will really work in that situation.
[40:24.480 --> 40:27.000]  And that's the one thing about organic gardening
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.160]  and sourcing things locally.
[40:29.160 --> 40:31.480]  It's gonna help your plant fight off
[40:31.480 --> 40:32.920]  a lot of different diseases,
[40:32.920 --> 40:35.320]  pests that are found in your region.
[40:35.320 --> 40:37.240]  Especially if you're growing outside,
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.120]  use a lot of different IMOs.
[40:41.400 --> 40:42.920]  It's just indigenous microorganisms.
[40:42.920 --> 40:45.080]  Yeah, we will be having a,
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.440]  maybe we'll get into that a little more in another episode.
[40:47.440 --> 40:49.720]  We will be having a class,
[40:49.720 --> 40:51.520]  or I don't wanna say it's a class.
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.480]  We can go ahead and mention it on here.
[40:53.480 --> 40:55.580]  So we wanna start doing classes,
[40:55.580 --> 40:57.880]  but we need to know who wants to come to them.
[40:57.880 --> 40:59.000]  Yeah, let us know.
[40:59.000 --> 40:59.840]  Let us know.
[40:59.840 --> 41:02.100]  So we're gonna try to schedule a meet and greet
[41:02.100 --> 41:03.920]  before this month is over,
[41:03.920 --> 41:06.080]  maybe up in Colorado Springs,
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.560]  where if you listen to us, you follow us on Instagram,
[41:10.560 --> 41:11.960]  you've heard about the shop,
[41:11.960 --> 41:13.120]  you wanna talk.
[41:13.120 --> 41:13.960]  Try on what we got.
[41:13.960 --> 41:16.200]  Yeah, we wanna meet you.
[41:16.200 --> 41:17.760]  We wanna hear from you, wanna know who you are.
[41:17.760 --> 41:19.160]  You're important to us.
[41:19.160 --> 41:21.100]  So we'll get all of that stuff situated
[41:21.100 --> 41:22.360]  now that we're a sponsor.
[41:22.360 --> 41:25.360]  You'll hear from Jeff Show when that's ready.
[41:25.360 --> 41:26.560]  Yeah, we'll keep you guys posted.
[41:26.560 --> 41:28.480]  I like to announce when that stuff's coming.
[41:28.480 --> 41:30.080]  We're gonna do another night like that at Hygro
[41:30.080 --> 41:30.900]  also in the future,
[41:30.900 --> 41:32.120]  but Jesse's been booked busy.
[41:32.120 --> 41:33.520]  Yeah, I've actually talked to Jesse
[41:33.520 --> 41:35.520]  about the potential of us teaming up
[41:35.520 --> 41:37.680]  and maybe doing some classes together.
[41:38.800 --> 41:39.880]  Get hands on with everybody.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.640]  Jeff is so good at just articulating
[41:42.640 --> 41:45.400]  what needs to be done to basic,
[41:45.400 --> 41:46.240]  I mean really anybody.
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.760]  He can tell anybody how to grow.
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.360]  I was hoping he was gonna be here tonight.
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.600]  Yeah, but I know they're doing some really cool classes.
[41:51.600 --> 41:53.440]  I think they did cloning last time
[41:53.440 --> 41:56.120]  and some really awesome introduction classes.
[41:56.120 --> 41:57.920]  So I'm hoping we can team up
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.920]  and maybe do some more advanced classes for the team.
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.320]  Start off easy and then go into the heavy stuff
[42:03.320 --> 42:04.720]  and then people can leave if they get lost.
[42:04.720 --> 42:07.440]  Exactly, or if you come to us
[42:07.440 --> 42:09.880]  and you feel like maybe you need to,
[42:09.880 --> 42:10.720]  you know what I mean,
[42:10.720 --> 42:12.040]  maybe we're a little over your head,
[42:12.040 --> 42:14.120]  contact Hygro and Jesse.
[42:14.120 --> 42:15.800]  And they'll tell you,
[42:15.800 --> 42:17.000]  they'll walk you through the process.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.040]  They'll teach you how to clone,
[42:18.040 --> 42:19.600]  they'll teach you how to pH
[42:19.600 --> 42:21.000]  or whatever you need,
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.600]  they'll get you going.
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.760]  And then whenever you feel comfortable or you're ready,
[42:24.760 --> 42:25.680]  come to us.
[42:27.040 --> 42:28.120]  Yeah, I try to keep stuff,
[42:28.120 --> 42:29.800]  if you follow me on Instagram,
[42:29.800 --> 42:32.200]  the BigToka underscore,
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.680]  I kind of try to keep things simple
[42:34.680 --> 42:36.480]  so everybody can kind of grasp it.
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.880]  And then from there you can delve into a little bit more
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.040]  because a lot of growers,
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.720]  when they use bottle nutrients,
[42:44.720 --> 42:47.840]  they go to the Hydro store and they ask,
[42:47.840 --> 42:49.440]  what do I need to grow?
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.760]  What are you using?
[42:50.760 --> 42:51.600]  And it's like,
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.600]  you got to do some research to be a grower
[42:55.600 --> 42:57.920]  and your plants will appreciate that
[42:57.920 --> 43:00.640]  and you'll notice it in your results at the end.
[43:00.640 --> 43:05.560]  But I'll explain things
[43:05.600 --> 43:08.160]  but I'll let you open your mind to it more.
[43:08.160 --> 43:11.880]  So I'm gonna be running a lot of examples
[43:11.880 --> 43:14.200]  with products that we're gonna be carrying
[43:14.200 --> 43:15.480]  and research and development.
[43:15.480 --> 43:18.080]  So that's with Sean's page two
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.080]  and the Rocky Mountain Natural Farming.
[43:20.080 --> 43:23.200]  So just keep an eye out and just be part of the community.
[43:23.200 --> 43:24.440]  Especially when you're in Colorado,
[43:24.440 --> 43:26.960]  if you wanna link up and talk organics,
[43:26.960 --> 43:28.680]  we're always around.
[43:28.680 --> 43:30.200]  When is the shop open?
[43:30.200 --> 43:32.760]  The shop is open during the day.
[43:32.760 --> 43:35.000]  Get there before like two.
[43:35.840 --> 43:36.880]  It's a little earlier in the day.
[43:36.880 --> 43:40.200]  It's like 10 to four, I think.
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.560]  Jay is usually there.
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.840]  So flexible, the phone number's on the door.
[43:43.840 --> 43:45.560]  He's there basically every day of the week
[43:45.560 --> 43:47.280]  from about 10 to four.
[43:47.280 --> 43:48.800]  And then outside of that,
[43:48.800 --> 43:52.840]  just email or call or message him through Instagram
[43:52.840 --> 43:55.360]  and he'll meet you 24 seven.
[43:55.360 --> 43:56.920]  Or yeah, contact Nick.
[43:56.920 --> 43:58.280]  Cool, that's good to know.
[43:58.280 --> 44:00.280]  But if you want it, we got you.
[44:00.280 --> 44:01.680]  Yeah, we can get you what you need.
[44:01.680 --> 44:02.680]  And that's not just me, you guys,
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.520]  that's the customers.
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.840]  Yeah, exactly, that's the people, the growers,
[44:05.840 --> 44:06.680]  the patients.
[44:06.680 --> 44:07.920]  I didn't mean to call you customers.
[44:07.920 --> 44:09.640]  But the shoppers.
[44:09.640 --> 44:12.520]  No, yeah, we want them to know that the product's out there
[44:12.520 --> 44:14.120]  but the help's out there at the same time.
[44:14.120 --> 44:15.600]  Don't feel like you're doing this alone.
[44:15.600 --> 44:17.640]  These guys have put me on the track to organics.
[44:17.640 --> 44:19.480]  Like without a couple of conversations
[44:19.480 --> 44:22.400]  between Spence and Sean, I'd still be using the bottles.
[44:23.280 --> 44:24.120]  It's not worth it.
[44:24.120 --> 44:24.960]  Shout out Spence.
[44:24.960 --> 44:25.800]  And Nestor.
[44:25.800 --> 44:26.640]  Yeah, shout out Spence.
[44:26.640 --> 44:27.480]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with Nestor,
[44:27.480 --> 44:29.680]  but Nestor up in Denver, he's won a few cups.
[44:29.680 --> 44:31.640]  I forget the shop he used to grow for,
[44:31.640 --> 44:32.880]  but that dude gave a talk one night
[44:32.880 --> 44:35.480]  about soil recycling and reconditioning.
[44:35.480 --> 44:37.760]  Oh yeah, there's a lot that's on my brain.
[44:37.760 --> 44:40.000]  So hopefully we can definitely get on here again
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.960]  and have some more conversations
[44:41.960 --> 44:44.120]  and get into things a little bit more in depth.
[44:44.120 --> 44:46.480]  This is my one argument with organics,
[44:46.480 --> 44:47.880]  all right, with your plants.
[44:49.600 --> 44:51.680]  He sat up in the back, he's all serious.
[44:51.680 --> 44:53.520]  When you go to put it in your plant,
[44:53.520 --> 44:55.000]  I want you to freaking drink it
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.480]  before you put it in your plant.
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.520]  And if you don't feel comfortable doing that,
[44:58.520 --> 45:01.120]  then don't use it on your plant.
[45:01.640 --> 45:04.760]  I will eat anything in my garden right now.
[45:04.760 --> 45:05.920]  Just gonna throw that out there.
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.760]  Even the worm poop?
[45:06.760 --> 45:08.160]  Even the worm castings?
[45:08.160 --> 45:09.240]  Oh, you'll be perfectly fine.
[45:09.240 --> 45:12.000]  You will not have to pay me to ingest something
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.800]  in the garden that we have.
[45:13.800 --> 45:16.080]  Everything is how it should be.
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.480]  As a patient, you medicate in many different ways.
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.200]  And one of those ways is ingesting raw cannabis as a plant.
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.160]  Juicing the leaves, the nugs.
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.520]  There's a lot of beneficials for that with pain fibromyalgia
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.040]  just with antibiotics in the cannabis.
[45:35.040 --> 45:37.520]  So releasing a lot of more of those cannabinoids
[45:37.520 --> 45:38.360]  that aren't available,
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.120]  what you can smoke or ingest through edibles.
[45:41.120 --> 45:43.400]  And some people can't take edibles or ingest
[45:43.400 --> 45:44.560]  and that's not what they're looking for.
[45:44.560 --> 45:49.400]  So having a plant that you can actually chew,
[45:50.840 --> 45:52.960]  what should be, like any vegetable or flower,
[45:52.960 --> 45:53.800]  you should be able to eat it.
[45:53.800 --> 45:54.640]  It's ingestible.
[45:54.640 --> 45:57.640]  If it's for medicine, I believe it should be food grade.
[45:57.640 --> 45:58.960]  That's kind of how I look at it.
[45:59.920 --> 46:01.800]  If you're gonna be treating it as medicine,
[46:01.800 --> 46:02.840]  then it should be food grade.
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.720]  Recreational purposes, it is what it is.
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.160]  But if you're gonna be, for example, a medical dispensary,
[46:09.160 --> 46:11.640]  I'm calling you out, quit using the shit.
[46:11.640 --> 46:13.720]  If you wanna know how to grow proper cannabis
[46:13.720 --> 46:15.000]  for your dispensaries, get out of-
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.560]  Sick people don't need phosphates.
[46:17.560 --> 46:18.600]  I mean, they really don't.
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.960]  And there's even other companies-
[46:20.960 --> 46:23.440]  Eagle 20, oh, I had a conversation about that earlier.
[46:23.440 --> 46:25.000]  Take that off your shelf.
[46:25.000 --> 46:25.840]  People need to educate themselves.
[46:25.840 --> 46:28.160]  Take everything off your shelf and get some worm castings.
[46:28.160 --> 46:29.160]  I wouldn't even say that.
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.440]  Just people need to educate themselves.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.800]  Don't go jump into organics.
[46:33.800 --> 46:36.080]  Don't go and read every organic book
[46:36.080 --> 46:37.080]  and buy everything in there,
[46:37.080 --> 46:38.720]  because that's just as bad.
[46:38.720 --> 46:40.760]  I mean, there's reasons that you,
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.160]  I mean, I would almost say use synthetics
[46:43.160 --> 46:45.640]  instead of bone meal or blood meal,
[46:45.640 --> 46:48.880]  because those are more harmful than they are good.
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.720]  Same thing with glacial rock dust, soft rock phosphates,
[46:52.720 --> 46:54.320]  different things like that, azomites,
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.440]  they carry heavy metals and used in large quantities,
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.920]  like a lot of these super soils call for.
[46:59.920 --> 47:02.000]  You're putting the same, if not more,
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.400]  heavy metals into your plant.
[47:03.400 --> 47:04.880]  And you're using chelated nutrients.
[47:04.880 --> 47:05.720]  Exactly.
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.480]  So you really want to educate yourself, and that's key.
[47:09.480 --> 47:12.800]  I really want to emphasize that if it's for medical purposes
[47:12.800 --> 47:15.760]  and you won't ingest it yourself,
[47:15.760 --> 47:18.360]  if it's not food grade, it's not medical grade.
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.280]  Exactly.
[47:19.280 --> 47:20.600]  So I can eat worm castings.
[47:20.600 --> 47:22.360]  You can totally eat worm castings.
[47:22.360 --> 47:23.440]  I wouldn't recommend it,
[47:23.440 --> 47:26.520]  but the basis is you're not gonna get sick.
[47:26.520 --> 47:27.600]  It's not gonna hurt you.
[47:27.600 --> 47:28.440]  You're not gonna get...
[47:28.440 --> 47:29.280]  You're gonna get bound up a little bit.
[47:29.280 --> 47:30.120]  Yeah, and you know, I'm just,
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.600]  that's kind of where I'm coming from is that,
[47:31.600 --> 47:34.560]  you know, if it says keep out of reach of children
[47:34.560 --> 47:36.560]  and it has a warning label of like what to do
[47:36.560 --> 47:38.600]  when you get it in your eyes,
[47:38.600 --> 47:40.120]  that's not cool.
[47:40.120 --> 47:41.640]  I mean, if it's like, if I can't touch it,
[47:41.640 --> 47:44.040]  if it can't touch my skin, why can't it touch my plant?
[47:44.040 --> 47:44.960]  Right, exactly.
[47:44.960 --> 47:47.280]  And that's really where I'm coming from.
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.000]  I feel like people are just not aware.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.560]  Like I said, just educate yourselves.
[47:52.560 --> 47:55.360]  Not every organic option is the best, or you know,
[47:55.360 --> 47:56.680]  or what is said organic.
[47:56.680 --> 47:59.360]  Organic meal and bone meal, that's a slaughterhouse product.
[47:59.360 --> 48:00.480]  That's cow leftovers.
[48:00.480 --> 48:01.320]  No way you source it from.
[48:01.320 --> 48:03.960]  Exactly, and especially depending on where you source it
[48:03.960 --> 48:07.840]  from a feather meal, that's just as, that's even worse.
[48:07.840 --> 48:09.720]  Yeah, it's the McDonald's chicken farm.
[48:09.720 --> 48:12.160]  Cover crops, you know, barley and stuff like that,
[48:12.160 --> 48:14.000]  like that you're gonna use as a mulch, you know,
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.320]  watch out where you get that from.
[48:15.320 --> 48:18.240]  You don't want any dyes or any pesticides used with that.
[48:18.240 --> 48:21.040]  Like 99% of corn is all GMO.
[48:21.040 --> 48:21.880]  Yeah.
[48:21.880 --> 48:23.920]  So for your seed sprouted teas.
[48:23.920 --> 48:25.160]  Whoa, that was a weird noise.
[48:25.760 --> 48:27.640]  Wow, okay, that's what happens when that cord touches there.
[48:27.640 --> 48:28.720]  That was pretty neat.
[48:29.680 --> 48:31.640]  That's what happens when the email cord touches
[48:31.640 --> 48:33.680]  the microphone or the headphone jack, you guys.
[48:33.680 --> 48:34.520]  That was neat.
[48:34.520 --> 48:36.640]  Just dab my eardrums.
[48:36.640 --> 48:38.800]  Sounded like a weird heartbeat in my head.
[48:38.800 --> 48:39.640]  I'm taking a dab.
[48:39.640 --> 48:41.480]  Somebody say something intelligent.
[48:41.480 --> 48:42.320]  I don't know right now.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.320]  I'm saying, I forgot what we were talking about real quick.
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.520]  Cause that's sometimes how it goes.
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.200]  You're just sitting around the table taking dabs.
[48:48.200 --> 48:50.760]  Yeah, I don't know what we're taking a dab of right now.
[48:50.760 --> 48:53.920]  Yeah, I just, basically if you're really,
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.320]  yeah, we're still on starting, you know, running organic.
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.320]  There's so many avenues to go and you know, it's just.
[49:03.480 --> 49:04.800]  My head is still making that noise
[49:04.800 --> 49:06.760]  from the headphone jack after that dab.
[49:06.760 --> 49:08.360]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that was good.
[49:08.360 --> 49:13.360]  Start off slow and you know, don't read too many books.
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.360]  Go, like I said, source things that were written
[49:18.360 --> 49:19.200]  a little while ago.
[49:19.200 --> 49:20.680]  There's a really good website called
[49:20.680 --> 49:22.520]  The Unconventional Farmer.
[49:22.520 --> 49:23.440]  Yeah.
[49:23.960 --> 49:25.000]  Shout out Gil Cardigan.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.280]  Yeah, they are really cool dudes.
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.520]  They keep it real simple and fun.
[49:30.520 --> 49:31.680]  It's very hands on.
[49:31.680 --> 49:33.720]  S Squiggles WordPress.
[49:33.720 --> 49:34.560]  Yeah.
[49:34.560 --> 49:36.480]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with them.
[49:36.480 --> 49:38.160]  Cchar.org.
[49:39.000 --> 49:39.840]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[49:39.840 --> 49:41.040]  Mount Microbes.
[49:41.040 --> 49:45.200]  Don't go to dot coms, go to dot orgs or edus.
[49:45.200 --> 49:47.720]  But even then, you know, check where it was sourced from.
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.480]  But just explore.
[49:49.480 --> 49:51.120]  Don't be afraid to go to the library.
[49:51.120 --> 49:53.400]  Yeah, don't just stick to weed forums and stuff.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.520]  We're not growing just cannabis.
[49:56.520 --> 50:00.440]  You're growing a plant and this benefits you.
[50:00.440 --> 50:02.440]  Yeah, this benefits you in every way.
[50:02.440 --> 50:04.800]  Let's just, you want to touch on some books real quick?
[50:04.800 --> 50:06.040]  Since we're right here.
[50:06.040 --> 50:07.800]  This is Sean's apartment for sure.
[50:07.800 --> 50:08.640]  Touch my books.
[50:08.640 --> 50:11.560]  Okay, TLO, True Living Organics.
[50:11.560 --> 50:12.400]  Read it.
[50:12.400 --> 50:13.240]  Yes.
[50:13.240 --> 50:14.080]  Very good beginner book.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.240]  Don't follow it word for word.
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.400]  But it is an, I mean, it's one of the best books
[50:20.400 --> 50:21.240]  I've ever read.
[50:21.240 --> 50:23.120]  It teaches you what you can and can't use for sure.
[50:23.840 --> 50:26.320]  It was detrimental in creating who I am today.
[50:26.320 --> 50:27.640]  For the simple fact of that,
[50:27.640 --> 50:30.720]  it taught me what things were, where they were from.
[50:30.720 --> 50:33.520]  It really opened my eyes to how you can create
[50:33.520 --> 50:34.960]  your own nutrients and all that.
[50:34.960 --> 50:37.280]  You shouldn't just take everything at face value.
[50:37.280 --> 50:38.120]  The first time I mixed up my own tea,
[50:38.120 --> 50:39.760]  that's the book I grabbed for instructions.
[50:39.760 --> 50:41.440]  That was my first jump into organics.
[50:41.440 --> 50:44.200]  And that goes right back though to, you know,
[50:44.200 --> 50:47.240]  depending on how you personally want to garden
[50:47.240 --> 50:49.880]  and what level of organics you want to be on,
[50:49.880 --> 50:50.960]  you know, that's where you want to take things
[50:50.960 --> 50:51.800]  with the grain of salt.
[50:51.840 --> 50:55.040]  So you might not want to use all of the phosphate products
[50:55.040 --> 50:56.960]  or you might not want to use all of the animal-based
[50:56.960 --> 50:57.800]  products.
[50:57.800 --> 50:58.640]  Maybe more of a beginner.
[50:58.640 --> 51:00.160]  It's definitely a good, kind of a good guideline.
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.400]  And you gotta, and that's the thing with growing cannabis.
[51:02.400 --> 51:03.240]  You're doing it your way.
[51:03.240 --> 51:04.600]  It's like music.
[51:04.600 --> 51:06.600]  John Bonham might've played it, boom, cha,
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.440]  and you could play it, boom, cha,
[51:08.440 --> 51:10.120]  and give it your own flavor, you know,
[51:10.120 --> 51:12.960]  put open hi-hat somewhere and do your thing with it.
[51:12.960 --> 51:14.880]  Because your plants are in a different room.
[51:14.880 --> 51:17.200]  You could, we can mix up the same exact nudes
[51:17.200 --> 51:18.840]  and feed all of our plants that,
[51:18.840 --> 51:20.480]  and some of our plants are going to be pissed off.
[51:20.480 --> 51:21.680]  Completely different.
[51:21.680 --> 51:23.880]  Yeah, so you gotta perfect it.
[51:23.880 --> 51:25.280]  It's like having girlfriends, man.
[51:25.280 --> 51:26.800]  One of them is not going to like the same thing
[51:26.800 --> 51:27.640]  as the other one.
[51:27.640 --> 51:28.800]  That's not even the answer to that.
[51:28.800 --> 51:32.440]  You're probably smart.
[51:32.440 --> 51:33.680]  I try sometimes.
[51:34.880 --> 51:37.720]  Yes, I'd say that we were, you know,
[51:37.720 --> 51:39.760]  the TLO is a good place to start.
[51:39.760 --> 51:40.600]  Okay.
[51:40.600 --> 51:43.160]  And then you, while you're reading through that,
[51:43.160 --> 51:44.360]  or before you read through that,
[51:44.360 --> 51:46.640]  I would recommend everybody should just,
[51:46.640 --> 51:48.880]  it sounds stupid, but just make yourself read it.
[51:48.880 --> 51:51.760]  Everybody should read some sort of Jorge Cervante
[51:51.760 --> 51:53.760]  or Ed Rose, everybody should read it.
[51:53.760 --> 51:56.760]  If you haven't, read Ed Rosenthal.
[51:56.760 --> 51:57.600]  The Oaksterdam Course Guide.
[51:57.600 --> 52:00.000]  Marijuana Horticulture, yeah, that's the one.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.560]  The Oaksterdam Course Guide, it's marijuana horticulture.
[52:02.560 --> 52:05.440]  I highly recommend reading that one.
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.320]  Don't cut corners in your room.
[52:07.320 --> 52:09.120]  Sometimes you might have to in the beginning,
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.400]  but as you go, something to do
[52:11.400 --> 52:13.320]  is definitely upgrade your room.
[52:13.320 --> 52:15.800]  Dial it in, have an environment.
[52:15.800 --> 52:17.480]  With the organics, the one thing
[52:18.400 --> 52:21.920]  you're trying to do is mimic nature to your fullest.
[52:21.920 --> 52:25.320]  And when growing in a pot and using
[52:26.560 --> 52:29.200]  a chelated nutrient in a bottle,
[52:29.200 --> 52:32.400]  there's nothing living going on there, there's no nature.
[52:32.400 --> 52:35.440]  So by bringing those microbes into your pot,
[52:35.440 --> 52:38.720]  you're doing so much to your plant.
[52:38.720 --> 52:42.920]  You know, it's actually going back to what it should.
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.640]  And it might take it a little bit, some strains,
[52:44.640 --> 52:47.160]  you know, might freak out depending on where you get it from
[52:47.840 --> 52:49.040]  but if you're gonna do organics
[52:49.040 --> 52:51.440]  and you like to start from seed,
[52:51.440 --> 52:53.480]  definitely start from seed.
[52:53.480 --> 52:54.320]  Start from seed.
[52:54.320 --> 52:56.440]  Yeah, get some good quality genetics.
[52:56.440 --> 52:57.960]  Don't skimp on that.
[52:57.960 --> 53:01.240]  Cuts are good, but definitely a good way to grow
[53:01.240 --> 53:03.240]  is start some seeds, you know,
[53:03.240 --> 53:05.960]  jump in and even if it's bag seed, you know, it's.
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.880]  Yeah, I don't oppose growing a bag seed.
[53:07.880 --> 53:08.720]  No, it's not bad.
[53:08.720 --> 53:09.760]  Ken Dog was a bag seed.
[53:09.760 --> 53:12.040]  Yeah, you know, if you got a bag seed
[53:12.040 --> 53:14.880]  and it turns out to be a reg seed,
[53:15.640 --> 53:17.320]  you know, pollen happens and, you know,
[53:17.320 --> 53:18.520]  it might be beneficial for you
[53:18.520 --> 53:20.400]  to let it happen the first time, who knows?
[53:20.400 --> 53:22.080]  But that's a whole nother subject as well.
[53:22.080 --> 53:23.440]  As long as they're not all female.
[53:23.440 --> 53:24.520]  All right, more books, more books.
[53:24.520 --> 53:25.720]  More, let you back on track.
[53:25.720 --> 53:28.520]  Yeah, after I'd read TLO,
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.920]  would be one of the first ones,
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.760]  Marijuana Horticulture, Ed Rosenthal,
[53:31.760 --> 53:33.880]  some sort of basic book.
[53:33.880 --> 53:35.840]  His books are amazing just because they touch
[53:35.840 --> 53:37.680]  on so many different bases.
[53:37.680 --> 53:39.440]  It's a great gateway.
[53:39.440 --> 53:41.560]  And when you read books like that,
[53:41.560 --> 53:43.800]  if you're not familiar with like academia
[53:43.800 --> 53:46.240]  and like going to school and things like that,
[53:46.240 --> 53:47.720]  it really helps recharge you
[53:47.720 --> 53:51.400]  and teach you how to research and teach how to learn.
[53:51.400 --> 53:54.120]  And that's where I really recommend reading books.
[53:54.120 --> 53:57.200]  And that's where the Rev, like,
[53:57.200 --> 53:59.640]  I think pinpoints his book is getting hands-on
[53:59.640 --> 54:02.880]  to people that aren't necessarily, like Sean said,
[54:02.880 --> 54:04.960]  you know, book smart or can sit in a classroom
[54:04.960 --> 54:05.800]  and learn something.
[54:05.800 --> 54:07.400]  The Rev will tell a joke in the middle of a paragraph.
[54:07.400 --> 54:10.120]  Yeah, he'll go totally off, you know, off key.
[54:10.120 --> 54:11.880]  So if you, you know, if you think like,
[54:11.880 --> 54:13.200]  oh man, I hate reading,
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.040]  or if you're not like that type of guy, just try it.
[54:15.040 --> 54:16.120]  And I promise, and it's different
[54:16.120 --> 54:18.520]  when you want to learn something.
[54:18.520 --> 54:20.440]  But yeah, so I would go with those books.
[54:20.440 --> 54:22.640]  Those are great bases.
[54:22.640 --> 54:24.280]  And then when you want to start getting
[54:24.280 --> 54:25.720]  a little bit more advanced,
[54:25.720 --> 54:28.000]  obviously most people are familiar,
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.560]  have heard of Teeming with Microbes.
[54:30.560 --> 54:32.880]  So that one's, it's a little complex.
[54:32.880 --> 54:37.400]  That one I read over and over and over again.
[54:37.400 --> 54:39.880]  It's kind of, it's a quick reference book.
[54:39.880 --> 54:42.480]  When you, so you'll use the Rev's book a lot
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.000]  and you'll see when you, as a beginner
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.760]  and you're mixing soils and you're making teas,
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.600]  you're going to have that.
[54:46.600 --> 54:49.200]  It's going to, you're going to end up buying six copies of it
[54:49.200 --> 54:50.800]  because you're going to have it next to your brewer
[54:50.800 --> 54:52.680]  and you're going to leave it on the, you know.
[54:52.680 --> 54:54.120]  If you don't know how to do something,
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.520]  he starts you off and he lets you know
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.680]  that you might mess up, but you know, like I said,
[54:58.680 --> 55:00.520]  smell your teas or you're going to mess up.
[55:00.520 --> 55:03.000]  But yeah, the Teeming with Microbes book
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.040]  will eventually become like that for you
[55:05.040 --> 55:06.360]  once you kind of, you know,
[55:06.360 --> 55:07.800]  once you get to the next level,
[55:07.800 --> 55:09.520]  you're going to start getting there.
[55:09.520 --> 55:11.280]  But once you've covered your basis
[55:11.280 --> 55:13.800]  and you're a little bit more familiar with the,
[55:13.800 --> 55:16.400]  you know, soil food web and how things work
[55:16.400 --> 55:17.880]  as far as nutrient cycling,
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.160]  and you get a little bit more familiar
[55:19.160 --> 55:21.760]  with compost tea inputs, why you're using them,
[55:21.760 --> 55:23.320]  and you really like, oh, you know what?
[55:23.320 --> 55:24.640]  This is, this is cool.
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.440]  I'm using my, even if you're using
[55:26.440 --> 55:28.120]  your bottled organic nutrient,
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.000]  you got your earthworm castings in your mix,
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.280]  you're doing your weekly teas and you're rolling
[55:32.280 --> 55:33.880]  and you're like, man, this is cool.
[55:33.880 --> 55:35.280]  I want to take it to the next level.
[55:35.280 --> 55:36.800]  I've already read these books,
[55:37.640 --> 55:40.080]  especially if you live in a state to where you don't really,
[55:40.080 --> 55:42.680]  you know, not everybody's open about growing.
[55:42.680 --> 55:43.520]  Yeah.
[55:43.520 --> 55:44.360]  Don't be afraid to grow.
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.640]  Where I would go is, then where I would turn is,
[55:47.640 --> 55:49.800]  like where we were kind of talking about earlier,
[55:49.800 --> 55:51.360]  you know, there's a lot of PDF files
[55:51.360 --> 55:54.800]  about Korean natural farming,
[55:54.800 --> 55:57.880]  different things like that, natural farming inputs.
[55:57.880 --> 56:00.080]  That's where I would recommend going
[56:00.080 --> 56:02.120]  once you kind of get comfortable with your basis.
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.320]  And that'll tell you how you can actually
[56:04.320 --> 56:05.720]  make your own inoculates,
[56:05.720 --> 56:07.640]  how you can make your own fertilizers.
[56:07.680 --> 56:08.880]  And that's where-
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.400]  Things like that save all your money.
[56:10.400 --> 56:12.360]  Yeah. The unconventional farmer shows that,
[56:12.360 --> 56:13.960]  but the Rev, getting back to this,
[56:13.960 --> 56:16.200]  since this is like a beginning into organics,
[56:16.200 --> 56:17.800]  he shows you different ways to do it
[56:17.800 --> 56:20.360]  that might suit your grow style.
[56:20.360 --> 56:23.160]  If you don't want to necessarily do teas,
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.280]  but just want to use waters,
[56:24.280 --> 56:26.200]  he talks about like nutrient spikes
[56:26.200 --> 56:28.480]  that you can put in your soil that are beneficial.
[56:28.480 --> 56:30.560]  And that's how I first got into organics.
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.560]  I just, I couldn't have some plants inside,
[56:33.560 --> 56:35.320]  so I needed to put them outdoors
[56:35.320 --> 56:36.720]  and not have to check on them that much.
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.160]  So I said, why not try it?
[56:38.160 --> 56:40.040]  And it worked out pretty well.
[56:40.040 --> 56:42.680]  Don't overdo it, that's for sure.
[56:42.680 --> 56:44.200]  Cause you can really mess things up.
[56:44.200 --> 56:45.960]  I think I actually said on like what,
[56:45.960 --> 56:47.760]  maybe the first show about how I actually
[56:47.760 --> 56:49.080]  ran a lot of the Rev stuff.
[56:49.080 --> 56:49.920]  Yeah. Yeah.
[56:49.920 --> 56:51.960]  Yeah. It fucked my world up.
[56:51.960 --> 56:53.440]  But you know, you gotta learn somewhere.
[56:53.440 --> 56:55.000]  Animal proteins and-
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.440]  You could really overdo a lot of it.
[56:56.440 --> 56:57.680]  You can really burn your plants.
[56:57.680 --> 56:59.000]  They get super hot.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.440]  They need to decompose over time.
[57:01.440 --> 57:04.440]  You need to give them their moment to shine in your soil.
[57:05.360 --> 57:06.760]  I wouldn't try the Revs mix.
[57:06.760 --> 57:07.600]  Yeah.
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.320]  What I would do is if you really want to start
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.040]  mixing your own soil,
[57:12.040 --> 57:14.200]  and like you really, you're just fucking
[57:14.200 --> 57:17.280]  just determined on it and you go into the Hydro store
[57:17.280 --> 57:19.840]  and you're gonna pick up some amendments.
[57:19.840 --> 57:23.040]  Basically, if you're gonna go with the back soil,
[57:23.040 --> 57:24.040]  it doesn't matter.
[57:24.040 --> 57:26.400]  You can go Sunshine 4, you can go Pro Mix,
[57:26.400 --> 57:28.120]  you can go Happy Frog.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.520]  It doesn't matter.
[57:29.520 --> 57:30.760]  Just pick what you want.
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.600]  I personally would recommend you going
[57:32.600 --> 57:33.960]  with the sterile medium, something
[57:34.480 --> 57:36.080]  with no real nutrient pack to it.
[57:36.080 --> 57:36.920]  Yeah.
[57:36.920 --> 57:37.880]  Start from a laboratory standpoint.
[57:37.880 --> 57:41.840]  I would recommend like a Pro Mix or a base Sunshine mix,
[57:41.840 --> 57:43.720]  or even a Sunshine Advanced.
[57:44.680 --> 57:46.760]  Think those options are really great.
[57:46.760 --> 57:49.680]  If you don't even want to buy your own back soil,
[57:49.680 --> 57:53.240]  then just go and pick up a brick of peat moss from Lowe's,
[57:53.240 --> 57:57.720]  go and get you a bag of perlite from the Hydro store.
[57:57.720 --> 57:58.760]  Yeah, or the farming store.
[57:58.760 --> 57:59.600]  Or the farming store.
[57:59.600 --> 58:00.440]  Or the garden supply store.
[58:00.440 --> 58:02.600]  Just watch out, because sometimes when you source
[58:02.600 --> 58:04.200]  that stuff, things can come in it.
[58:04.200 --> 58:07.360]  So you might want to treat it naturally
[58:07.360 --> 58:09.880]  before you start using it, or keep an eye on it,
[58:09.880 --> 58:12.240]  because pests are everywhere.
[58:12.240 --> 58:14.320]  Little bugs, microbes are everywhere.
[58:14.320 --> 58:16.840]  Fungus, and you don't want to bring in-
[58:16.840 --> 58:18.680]  How much are my worm castings gonna help me
[58:18.680 --> 58:20.400]  keep away those pests?
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.080]  Well, that's gonna build up just everything
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.320]  in the soil around your rhizosphere that the plant needs.
[58:26.320 --> 58:29.080]  It's gonna start fighting the fight
[58:29.080 --> 58:31.440]  before your plant's even growing.
[58:31.480 --> 58:34.240]  So it's like an antibiotic.
[58:34.240 --> 58:37.800]  It's gonna help build your plant's immune system.
[58:37.800 --> 58:40.400]  Like you said, it'll start fighting it from the inside out.
[58:40.400 --> 58:43.520]  That kind of goes back down into chitin,
[58:43.520 --> 58:46.840]  eating bacteria and how that's cycled through the plant.
[58:46.840 --> 58:49.320]  I'd love to come to, we're gonna get some,
[58:49.320 --> 58:50.680]  tell Jeff you want classes,
[58:50.680 --> 58:53.080]  because I really want to get to talking about
[58:53.080 --> 58:55.960]  the different aspects, what is in our castings
[58:55.960 --> 58:57.280]  and why they work.
[58:57.280 --> 58:59.800]  Yeah, we'll do more episodes for sure.
[58:59.800 --> 59:01.200]  I'll have you guys back soon,
[59:01.960 --> 59:04.280]  because I want to do an episode about like,
[59:04.280 --> 59:05.120]  we can't have everybody,
[59:05.120 --> 59:05.960]  guys, we're not telling you
[59:05.960 --> 59:07.280]  throw away the bottled nutrients today.
[59:07.280 --> 59:08.240]  That's not what anyone's saying.
[59:08.240 --> 59:09.080]  Don't go just-
[59:09.080 --> 59:10.320]  We want to find a balance for you.
[59:10.320 --> 59:11.720]  So that'll be one of our next topic,
[59:11.720 --> 59:14.880]  is find the balance between the bottles and the organics.
[59:14.880 --> 59:16.080]  Yeah, in the meantime,
[59:16.080 --> 59:19.000]  yeah, just don't toss your bottled nutrients.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.640]  Don't throw anything away.
[59:21.640 --> 59:24.360]  Slowly get some worm castings,
[59:24.360 --> 59:27.760]  start making teas and then slowly start working things out.
[59:27.760 --> 59:28.880]  It's not like a,
[59:28.920 --> 59:32.200]  you're not just gonna magically become an organic gardener.
[59:32.200 --> 59:33.800]  Right, dip your foot in the water.
[59:33.800 --> 59:35.320]  Yeah, this could be the way to
[59:35.320 --> 59:36.720]  way improve your growing though.
[59:36.720 --> 59:38.880]  This could make your buds taste better.
[59:38.880 --> 59:39.720]  It'll make them grow bigger.
[59:39.720 --> 59:40.760]  The taste of your-
[59:40.760 --> 59:43.000]  Yeah, you can smell it in this room, it's just sweeter.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.800]  And who knows, there's a lot of growers
[59:44.800 --> 59:47.320]  who will actually go to make the transition
[59:47.320 --> 59:49.880]  and then find their nice little happy spot in the middle
[59:49.880 --> 59:51.720]  and nothing's wrong with that.
[59:51.720 --> 59:53.600]  If that's what you want as a grower,
[59:53.600 --> 59:55.560]  I know a lot of people who are really happy
[59:55.560 --> 59:58.040]  and just kill it growing synthetics
[59:58.040 --> 59:59.560]  and organics together.
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.400]  So yeah, like you said,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.240]  it can really improve your growing style.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.520]  And whether you wanna commit to going fully organic
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.760]  or you wanna run synthetics,
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.400]  I think that everybody could benefit from-
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.040]  Yeah, just a little bit of worm casting.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.520]  Some of the flower that we're actually smoking tonight
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.320]  was grown by a friend that works at the grow warehouse
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.600]  in Colorado Springs who uses Rocky Mountain worm castings,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.960]  but he integrates it with Nectar of the Gods,
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.160]  but he uses Nectar of the Gods in a very low dosage
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.280]  with teas and he uses cover crops and things like that.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.280]  So he does practice an organic style of growing,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.360]  but it's not full organic permaculture.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.680]  It's got that bottle kick.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.640]  Yeah, it's got that little boost that it needs, but-
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.480]  The training wheels.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.680]  Yeah, the training wheels, but he is actually an arborist.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.560]  I've been looking into that.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.160]  So one of the things that we wanna try
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.840]  to be able to present through Jay
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.920]  is if it holds any merit to anybody out there,
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.320]  we're gonna call it Rocky Mountain Natural Farming Certified.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.360]  So what we'll do is we're gonna try to start looking
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.960]  into some of these products for you.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.120]  Yeah, we will R&D everything before it's on the shelf.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.240]  We'll give it our stamp of approval.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.240]  And there is no OMRI listing for us, man.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.400]  There is no...
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.280]  I mean, there is an OMRI listing on certain
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.480]  bottled nutrients and stuff,
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.840]  but we have nothing to really go off of.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.040]  We need to create some sort of system.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.640]  And that's what we're really hoping to do.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.680]  Know where you source from.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.520]  Is take the time for you to look into
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.480]  where your products come from, how they're made,
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.040]  how they affect the final product.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.240]  So that if I'm in your store,
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.400]  I can buy that and know that I didn't just buy-
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.240]  I'll tell you who planted it.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.080]  Chopped up dead babies.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.920]  I'll tell you where it came from.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.760]  Exactly, nice.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.080]  I'll tell you how it was harvested
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.320]  and when it was harvested.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.160]  There you go.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.560]  And that's very important to us.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.000]  You guys are gonna have to hire more people.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.400]  Open your doors more.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.480]  After a couple of episodes,
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.920]  you're gonna get people knocking on your door.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.760]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.200]  And in the meantime, as we get things working,
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.100]  like I said, please contact us.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.140]  We're working really hard to make orders
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.980]  and keep everybody happy.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.060]  Do you guys ship?
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:58.900]  We do ship.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.300]  Nationwide, nationwide.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.140]  They're all like, oh yeah.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.320]  We have homies all over the place
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.540]  that use Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.040]  What's the website?
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.620]  Rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.580]  Or you can get in touch with any one of us
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.920]  through Instagram or our emails
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.660]  that we will leave with Jeff.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.980]  I would highly recommend
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.220]  if you want something out of the state of Colorado,
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.380]  I would recommend going online
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.660]  and then just sourcing it straight through
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.380]  rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.220]  As far as local growers,
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.860]  I cannot stress this enough.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.020]  We want to know who you are.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.620]  If you're in Colorado,
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.020]  stop by the store, let us know.
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.220]  Tell us, I talked to Jay a little earlier.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.380]  We're trying to work something out,
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.980]  but tell us that you listened to the show
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.860]  and that you heard about it
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.620]  and we'll give you a quarter pound of cover crop for free
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.460]  just for mentioning that, you know.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.340]  We'll figure something out.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.420]  We're nifty, so you can never know.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.980]  Just to repeat what he said,
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.620]  because the listeners were high.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.780]  If you mention, if you shop at the worm store
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.340]  and you say that you listen to the podcast,
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.100]  they'll give you a quarter pound of cover crop
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.660]  to start off your organics
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.820]  or to help out your organics.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.500]  It'll go on top, it'll keep everything moist
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.140]  so that your worm castings don't dry out.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:05.980]  So that your-
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.800]  Get your mycofungi going.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.380]  It does not die on you while it's growing
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.420]  and then when things dry out.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.780]  Because I think I let mine get a little too dry lately.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.100]  You want to use the natural enzymes of plants
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.340]  that are around you.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.100]  And that's one big thing with organics
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.260]  is with sourcing things locally.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.300]  We're gonna have to do like six episodes with you guys.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.380]  It's a lot of information.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.220]  Another thing is-
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.500]  What do you want to hear guys?
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.340]  What do you, tell us what you want to hear.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.780]  For the month of March, like I said,
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.060]  we're hoping to have some big things planned for April.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.140]  So we're hoping to have,
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.660]  we want to have a meet and greet this month.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.620]  We want to know who everybody's out there.
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.920]  Planning to have one or two classes in March,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.620]  all leading up to the cup with our booze and stuff.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.580]  But for the month of March,
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.540]  we're going to try to offer
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.380]  what I would call free consultation, basically.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.220]  We want to help you replace your nutrients.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:56.220]  So if you want to, direct message me, Nick, Alan, Jay,
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.180]  email us.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.340]  Or me, I'll put you in touch.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.100]  Yeah, or Jeff and get in touch with them.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.540]  And what we want to do is we want to know what you're using.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.380]  Yeah.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.220]  Okay.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.420]  And we're gonna, we want to help you out with that.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.620]  You'll say, but for this bottle, you could try this.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.440]  Exactly.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.280]  Throw away this bottle instead.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.380]  And then if, for example, even if you're, you know,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.340]  if you're in Nebraska or you're in Canada
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.740]  or you're in England.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.180]  If you're growing in a computer or a basement,
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.380]  we can direct you in the right direction.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.420]  Or, yeah, what I was going to say,
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.780]  or even we can, we can give you your product.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.780]  And then if we can't, if it doesn't seem logical.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.620]  It's just been no good.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.340]  My fingers, you know, it's, it's that jet life.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.700]  Alan's the joint monster.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.660]  I come from the East coast.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.140]  I'm saying I usually smoke blunts.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.380]  I was respectful in this situation.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.780]  Cause I didn't know if you smoked the blunts,
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.020]  but I am a blunt master.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.620]  Sean, I know is as well from the East coast with me.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.980]  So he is not afraid of the blunts as well as Spencer.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.860]  Probably smoke way more blunts than you would think.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.700]  So, uh, you know, I brought the Dutchies.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.620]  You showed up with the Dutchie.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.660]  Yeah, I brought the Dutchies.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.340]  So I just didn't, uh, roll on.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.700]  So maybe we have to roll on for a farewell.
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.260]  Some of us hate our lungs.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.100]  Yeah.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.300]  I love quality cannabis, but I love Dutch masters.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.100]  I'll take one or two off it just to be, uh,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:10.940]  just to celebrate with you.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.780]  That's all.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.600]  Yeah.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.320]  We can, we can, we can just not an everyday sort of thing.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.160]  Yeah.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.000]  I get so lit off the tobacco.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:17.960]  It just makes my head weird.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.480]  It's just a, it's a tradition.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.160]  And you know, I came out here and everybody smokes joints,
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.600]  but when I came out here,
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.720]  I couldn't find the Dutchies until one day I went to a
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.000]  little convenience store that had the Dutchies.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.960]  So shout out to that little convenience store in Colorado
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.800]  Springs.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.640]  He did a back flip.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.460]  Yeah.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.300]  I was all these Dutchies.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.360]  A homie told me about it.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.480]  He came into a session.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.640]  I was like, man, you just made my heart melt.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.240]  Cause like that is beautiful.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.120]  And they were fresh and it was a great night that night.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.880]  So shout out to them for always keeping the fresh Dutchies.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.520]  There you go.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.340]  All right.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.960]  So meet and greets coming up in March.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.800]  Yeah.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.620]  I was just going to say that too.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.320]  Sorry to interrupt you, but do it, do it.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.160]  I'm here all the time.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.000]  Yeah.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.040]  So we're up in the Springs.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.080]  Nick and I just kinda, we did a little side, uh,
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.640]  side meeting real quick and, uh,
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.280]  we might be having maybe like a barbecue.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.000]  So maybe we can do some organic, um, you know,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.720]  demonstrations there and get some little meet and greet
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.320]  sesh, you know, get hands on, uh, you know,
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.560]  just, uh, come up and we want to know the community.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.320]  You want to start a community and keep Colorado organic.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.520]  Like I said, we'll, uh, we'll keep in touch with you.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.360]  We'll let you know.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.880]  We're going to try to set a date for a nice little formal
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.720]  meet and greet.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.540]  Cool.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.440]  You don't have to come by for the whole show.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.160]  If you want to drop by and say, Hey, Friday night,
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.000]  this is going to happen.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.560]  We'll record you saying that.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.680]  I mean, there, there are phones,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.760]  we can text and things like that too.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.320]  I send a carrier pigeon.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.880]  I'll put your text on the show.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.840]  But yeah, if you just,
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.880]  like we'll get it to you to get out there and, uh,
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.320]  yeah, we'll just put a date out,
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.280]  but we're going to have a meet and greet this month.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.400]  Next month,
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.040]  we plan to have one or two classes leading up to the cup,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.440]  and then we're going to try to help everybody out as much as
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.520]  we can. And like I was saying before,
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.120]  if you want to change the way you grow, email us.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:06:59.960]  Yeah.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.120]  Email Jeff, email me, email Nick, email Alan, email Jay.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.640]  We'll, you know, tell us what you're using.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.920]  Tell us, you know, if you've ever done organics,
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.720]  give us a little bit of background about yourself.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.240]  How do you do things? You know,
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.840]  are you familiar with organics and let us help you let us help
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.520]  change the way you grow or at least change the way you source
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.360]  things.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.680]  We really want to shine some light on what you're using.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.120]  We want you to understand that's like, you know, okay,
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.680]  this is, you know, this is a better option.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.920]  Yeah. Not everything that's in a bottle is bad.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.000]  Some companies do care what their patients are putting into
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.520]  their plants and into their medicine.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.520]  So there are some good companies. So like I said,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.480]  nectar buying a lot of water. Yeah. There's a lot when you, yeah.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.240]  When you go to the hydro store and you're asking somebody a question,
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.560]  go to the bottle and read things.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.920]  A lot of companies put a face on their brand and that's marketing.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.480]  And that's not what organics is.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.640]  Organics is actually like having the product and it does what it does.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.240]  A lot of bottles put things on their labels to make you go towards the bottle
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.520]  that exactly the same thing as another nutrient line.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.720]  That might be a little cheaper and it's just, you know, it's the same value.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.840]  That's why some companies change their label every three months.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.360]  You have a big inside secret. You know what that 98% inert ingredient is.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.160]  You know what that water? Oh yeah. Water.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.560]  And you got to pay for that to be shipped. Water's expensive man.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.000]  Oh yeah, it is. You got to drive it across the country,
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.160]  put it in a plastic bottle and throw the bottle away.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.960]  Truckers don't like doing that. You know, kids in Africa need it. Yeah.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.240]  A lot of people could use that water. So, you know, get some organic.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.800]  Kids in Africa need the water from your nutrient bottles.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.280]  There's water coming out of your faucet.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.960]  So just make your own nutrients with the water coming out of your faucet.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.840]  All right. We've been going for a little bit over an hour.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.760]  We should start wrapping it up because the listeners get high as like we do and
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.840]  they start getting ADD.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.720]  Does anybody have anything they want to plug or anything that they really need to
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.000]  get off their chest here at the last couple of minutes of the show?
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.120]  I'll let you go around the circle.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.720]  Yeah, just a RockyMountWormCompany.com.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.640]  You can check us out on Instagram.

[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.440]  Well, like I said, we'll try to set up a link to all of us.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.400]  I'll put it in the show notes and I'll tweet that out.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]  We'll get it out there.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.840]  Sweet.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.520]  Yeah, just get in touch with us.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.520]  Let us know.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.840]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.080]  So this this was definitely a nice little intro to it.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.480]  This is number one. Yeah.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.920]  There'll be six or seven of these episodes.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.440]  Yeah. So what you guys want to know, like, let us let us know and, you know, hit
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.360]  us up and don't be afraid to, you know, let's discuss some things and, you know,
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.880]  let's talk organics and what really needs to be done and not spending, you know,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.440]  too much on what needs to be done and just getting it done.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.560]  You can really save some money and have a beautiful quality product.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.120]  So why wouldn't you want to why wouldn't you want to do that?
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.320]  So let us know and we'll we'll see you soon at a some type of demonstration.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.320]  Yeah. Barbecue sesh something.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.800]  So I'll keep you guys posted when those are.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.600]  Yeah, for sure. So just let us know.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.240]  And, you know, thank you for having us, Jeff.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.560]  Oh, for sure, man. Thanks for your time.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.600]  What's your Instagram?
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.680]  The big toker underscore.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.560]  All right. So follow him. He's got some good pictures.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.920]  Yeah, I check him out. I try to keep it real for you guys.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.720]  And it's my it's lifestyle.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.560]  He's the one that reached out to me and got him on the show and got this group on
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.320]  the show. Well, Sean's been here, but Jay was supposed to come.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  What's up, Jay? Where are you, bro?
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.560]  Yeah, we're going to get Jay on.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.000]  You hear how much fun this is, right, dude?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.840]  It's don't be scared. Don't be nervous.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.680]  Don't be worried. Don't buy another car.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.440]  Don't do inventory. Come hang out with us.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.080]  Do you mind?
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.400]  Smoke a dab. Chill out.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.040]  Yeah. Jay does not medicate like that.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.800]  So he will probably be floating on the ceiling just from the the aroma around
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.920]  us. Secondhand.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.200]  Yeah. We have to use the couch.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.320]  Yeah. We might have to put him in another room or something.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.560]  One time I gave Jesse a dab, a dab.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.480]  I said a dab. I gave Jesse a dab.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.640]  And he ended up on that couch for about two hours.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.520]  I can totally believe it. That's good.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.080]  I've had some of those. Any shout outs or plugs or anything over there, bro?
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.400]  Clear sky creation. Yeah.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.840]  Yeah. Clear sky creation.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.840]  Make sure to say the name of the wonderful artist that made this beautiful rap.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.600]  His wife. That's my wife, Elise.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.040]  Nice. Thank you, Elise.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.920]  It's awesome. I dig it. I'll wear it all the time.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.920]  I'm going to put her on a shorter chain so that it doesn't cover up my Irie logo
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.680]  and end up in all my food because at the length it is, it'll end up in my food, bro.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.240]  And we think you're a big guy.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.240]  So I love it. I love it.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.080]  I'm just going to shorten it up. I'll use the same necklace.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.480]  I'm just going to make it a little shorter.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.280]  I'll rock it every day. Every other day.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.640]  We're probably trade. I think mine's shorter.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.200]  Yeah, dude, I'm down. If you are, that looks just about the right length.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.480]  Yeah. Out of the like my food bowl goes right there.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.880]  For sure. She makes them all the time.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.480]  So nice. Thanks, man.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.240]  I'll just go have her shorten that one for me.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.720]  There you go. Final word.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.680]  Go buy some worms. Use your worms.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.880]  Yeah, do worm son. Worm castings.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.320]  If you're going to get worms from us, use the tag.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.840]  What are you worming with?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.320]  I just I'm going to coin that right now.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  So hashtag what are you worming with?
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.440]  And don't be afraid to let us use your like you said, we're a community.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.880]  So let's let's come together.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.480]  So one random question to you guys.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.880]  I'm adding OGT into my mix with my worm castings.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.920]  I'm just wasting money now.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.720]  I wouldn't use it.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.440]  Yeah, don't.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.520]  OGT is a soft rock phosphate
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.640]  trichoderma hyzarum, which has actually been taken out of like great white.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.080]  A couple of other products, they cycle nutrients too quickly.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.520]  I don't know if you're familiar with OG Bioar, but it's the same reason
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.280]  they recommend not using the new pack with a hydroponic system.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.480]  It'll actually cycle nutrients out of the plant.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.880]  OK, yeah. Be careful.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.640]  I just worm castings, man.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.280]  That you don't even need the molasses every time.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.000]  You just answered a question I had.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.960]  I have a few plants that are showing some deficiencies and they're fed.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.480]  And it's because I put so much OGT in there.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.960]  So just take that out.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.240]  Feed too much of a certain things, you know, it can lock out other things.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.120]  Yeah. But you never would think that OGT would cause you a problem.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.360]  No, I wouldn't assume so.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.160]  You know, that's one of the good I guess that's one of the good things about OGT
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.520]  is a little bit goes a long way.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.240]  They use a very aggressive, you know, form of.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.000]  It's like a third of a cup to 25 gallons of water.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.080]  They try to give you a plant that boost, you know, that you don't get with
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.040]  the organic sometimes because the plants, you know, still becoming itself.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.040]  But yes, bottom line with using Rocky Mountain worm castings.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.760]  No, don't you don't need to use OGT.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.440]  You're definitely not. You hear that, guys?
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.960]  And I'm not a hater of OGT, but these worm castings are ridiculously.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.160]  They are the it's retarded castings.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.240]  And then if you want to put soft rock phosphate or anything like that in there,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.600]  we also sell that at the shop.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.880]  And you can make your own instead of give you a little little, you know,
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.720]  a bump in the right direction. There we go.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.360]  These guys have already given me 20 new ideas.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.360]  I've got like seven products written down that I need to go pick up.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.080]  A couple new tricks I want to try. No. All right.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.880]  Did you get your shout outs? Yeah. We said thanks to your wife.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.240]  Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah, I'm high. Everyone's high at this table.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.480]  I'm feeling nice. All day. It's going to be a long episode.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.440]  So I'm going to read the part that I read at the end.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.200]  It says, thanks for listening to another episode, you guys.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.480]  Don't forget to check out our sponsors.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.440]  Nature's green remedies dot com and hygro indoor growing supplies.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.360]  And of course, we hyped them up a little bit on the show,
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.880]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.800]  Check out all my friends that came and joined us today.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.640]  Came and joined us. Yeah, that's a proper sentence.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.480]  Yeah. You follow them all on Instagram.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.360]  And now the show's over.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.400]  Please go to iTunes or Stitcher, go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher main page.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.120]  Search for agriculture or no search for a girl from your heart.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.800]  Man, I printed the wrong paper again.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.560]  Well, I said that.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.080]  I just say like that.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.400]  I was so upset about that.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.240]  And that is just something that they should, you know,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.240]  I don't know whatever Apple had to say, but hey, you should get in touch with us
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.520]  because, you know, this is something that you should have on your your station.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.640]  So there's actually some
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.320]  it's an educational agricultural entity that does courses and shit,
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.840]  and they didn't want cannabis associated with their school stuff.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.400]  So they're like, well, you got to change that.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.880]  If you if you don't want to use cannabis, we can go with hemp.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.080]  So hit us up and let us know.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.280]  We'll totally get to grow from your heart. Fits perfectly.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.120]  Yeah, I do like it.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.520]  Rings were about to grow from our heart.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520]  And that's true. You know what I mean?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520]  We're not growing from our wallets.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.520]  I do love cannabis. Yeah, we're growing from our heart.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.800]  So I'll correct myself.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.960]  I'll never say I grow culture again.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.920]  It's growing from your heart.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.040]  Find that review section in there and iTunes and Stitcher.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.840]  Give me a five star rating, please.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.320]  You can give me as many as you want.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.880]  But what happens is the more ratings I get, the more they move me up,
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.080]  the more I'm advertised in the show, the more people see us,
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.200]  the more people get to grow better cannabis, the more people quit using map
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.080]  and dap, the more people use worm castings, the more people have better weed
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.360]  and the more patients feel better.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.040]  And then your eyes are redder and things are better.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.000]  Yes. And it goes in circles like that.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  So type in a comment.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:06.640]  Let me see what you think.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.800]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.840]  If you think the show is awesome.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.280]  Tell me if you think the show sucks.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.200]  Tell me I'll try to improve what you say,
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.720]  but I'll probably just ignore you and keep doing what I'm doing because I like it.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.240]  Stitcher keeps changing the way the comments are handled.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.680]  So leave a comment wherever you can find the spot to do it.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.240]  And I'll read your comment on the show.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.440]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.200]  and every single episode is archived on iReedGeneticsColorado.com.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.560]  We recently added a donation button to the podcast page on the website.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.280]  If you feel like the show is worth a couple bucks, you can go to my website.

[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.800]  I do put a few hours into the show every week.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.880]  I'll buy new microphones.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.360]  I'll buy these new little covers for the mics.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.120]  Water bottles.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.840]  Water bottles. Yeah. Essentials.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.000]  Yeah. You know, just like that.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.200]  Every little bit counts.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.600]  Somebody told me that I should have the button and they would contribute.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.240]  So I put it up there, dude. So
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.080]  they have not done so yet.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.400]  It's only been there for a couple of weeks.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.360]  I'm not begging you guys.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.120]  If you want to do it, do it.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.160]  If not, then it doesn't happen.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.240]  Make sure you follow the podcast on Twitter.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.080]  There's a new Twitter handle I've been advertising.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.200]  It's a at GFYH podcast.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.160]  The old one.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.520]  I'm not going to use it anymore because it's the old word that we're not going to say.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.960]  Find me on Facebook. Search for a girl from your heart.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.120]  Make sure you follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.640]  That's the only Instagram I use for the podcast and for myself.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.880]  Lots of great cannabis pictures.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.200]  Lots of podcast photos.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.120]  Some contest stuff goes up there.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.320]  There may be another wire wrap to give away to you.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.040]  Looks in the future.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.160]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast

[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.440]  with lots of information.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.800]  They'll be back. You guys don't worry.

[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.840]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.480]  Thanks, man. Well.
