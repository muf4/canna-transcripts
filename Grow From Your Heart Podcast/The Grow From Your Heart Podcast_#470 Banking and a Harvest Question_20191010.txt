[00:00.000 --> 00:03.980]  Alright, here we go ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 470 of the Grow From Your
[00:03.980 --> 00:05.500]  Heart podcast.
[00:05.500 --> 00:09.200]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.200 --> 00:14.080]  If you need new regular, feminized or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:14.080 --> 00:21.840]  Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.460]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.460 --> 00:30.780]  Today I've been taking dabs of Halo Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.780 --> 00:33.820]  This is a blend of Headbanger and Infinity OG.
[00:33.820 --> 00:38.660]  On the package, the flavor is described as deconstructed sour diesel.
[00:38.660 --> 00:40.820]  They are getting really creative with these names.
[00:40.820 --> 00:44.700]  I don't know that it tasted like a deconstructed sour diesel.
[00:44.700 --> 00:50.860]  This concentrate definitely has a funky, dirty, deliciously disgusting, funky fuel aroma and
[00:50.860 --> 00:52.100]  flavor to it.
[00:52.100 --> 00:55.140]  My favorite part is that it makes me stupid.
[00:55.140 --> 00:58.420]  When I smoke this concentrate, it is full retard.
[00:58.420 --> 01:00.260]  I lose my keys when they're in my hand.
[01:00.260 --> 01:02.540]  I get lost when I'm not going anywhere.
[01:02.540 --> 01:06.460]  This concentrate makes me dumb and I fully appreciate it.
[01:06.460 --> 01:12.400]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and amazing Halo Live
[01:12.400 --> 01:13.860]  Batter.
[01:13.860 --> 01:17.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode I'm going to talk about a recent experience I
[01:17.060 --> 01:18.460]  had at the bank.
[01:18.460 --> 01:22.420]  I'm also going to read a message that came from YouTube.
[01:22.420 --> 01:26.100]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to some of our friends
[01:26.100 --> 01:28.100]  from Patreon.
[01:28.100 --> 01:31.220]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:31.220 --> 01:32.220]  to my friend Tommy.
[01:32.220 --> 01:35.220]  How about a big Giant Thank You shout out to JM.
[01:35.220 --> 01:39.580]  Of course a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you, a shout out and a hug to my buddy
[01:39.580 --> 01:40.580]  Stabby.
[01:40.580 --> 01:43.540]  How about a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you to Baked.
[01:43.540 --> 01:46.940]  Of course I want to send a giant shout out to my buddy Dick Goals.
[01:46.940 --> 01:50.080]  Always I want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and thank you to our
[01:50.080 --> 01:51.080]  buddy Victor.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.960]  I want to send a special thank you to our buddy Glenn G.
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.800]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.560]  shout out, fist bump, and a thank you to our buddy Todd K.
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.040]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who has supported the show on the Patreon
[02:07.040 --> 02:08.120]  campaign.
[02:08.120 --> 02:14.800]  If you would like to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com slash
[02:14.800 --> 02:16.160]  grow from your heart.
[02:16.160 --> 02:19.160]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.200]  Once again, big thanks, big shout out, big hug, and big fist bump to everybody who has
[02:24.200 --> 02:26.480]  supported the show on the Patreon campaign.
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.840]  All right, now let's work our way into the fun part of the show.
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.580]  I hinted that I wanted to talk about something that recently happened at the bank, so let's
[02:34.580 --> 02:36.360]  get right into that.
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.960]  I recently decided that it would be a wise move to have another business bank account.
[02:40.960 --> 02:43.100]  We don't need to get into any of those details here.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.100]  It was necessary.
[02:44.100 --> 02:48.280]  So I went to the bank and I explained to them my needs and what I wanted to do, and they
[02:48.280 --> 02:50.000]  were happy to help me out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.320]  A very nice lady took me to her office.
[02:52.320 --> 02:53.600]  I filled out some paperwork.
[02:53.600 --> 02:55.280]  She asked me a few questions.
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.920]  Then she started typing some details into the computer, and that was when she informed
[02:58.920 --> 03:05.760]  me that I would not be allowed to open a business checking or savings account with her bank.
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.400]  I feel like I immediately knew why, but I chose to play dumb.
[03:09.400 --> 03:11.480]  I said, well, why is that, ma'am?
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.000]  And she said, because you are currently a key holder and we cannot offer a business
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.880]  banking account to anybody who is a key holder.
[03:20.880 --> 03:23.040]  I said, what do you mean key holder?
[03:23.040 --> 03:24.240]  I don't work anywhere else.
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.480]  I have my own business.
[03:25.480 --> 03:28.640]  I just played dumb because I wanted to see where this would go.
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.880]  She informed me that her computer indicated to her that I have a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[03:35.880 --> 03:39.080]  Division key position badge.
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.280]  Now let me briefly explain this badge.
[03:42.280 --> 03:48.400]  Anybody who works in a legal cannabis facility in the state of Colorado is required to have
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.960]  a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division badge.
[03:52.960 --> 03:55.600]  That requires an intensive background check.
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.400]  It requires thorough fingerprinting, and it requires a lot of questionnaires and a little
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.040]  bit of money.
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.620]  Anybody who wants to work in the industry is required to have this badge.
[04:06.620 --> 04:10.080]  There are multiple badges available at different levels.
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.440]  Those different levels of badges give you different opportunities and availability for
[04:14.440 --> 04:17.240]  different positions in the facilities.
[04:17.240 --> 04:19.600]  Most folks will have what is called a support badge.
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.080]  That is for somebody who would be a trimmer or an assistant grower.
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.680]  If you are going to have keys or make decisions, you get what is called a key badge.
[04:27.680 --> 04:31.440]  If you are an owner, you've got a red badge, and it means you own the place.
[04:31.440 --> 04:35.800]  There are transportation badges and there are changes happening to the badging system
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.800]  as we speak.
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.680]  By the time this episode comes out, this could be inaccurate information, but at this time,
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.320]  there are three badges that I'm aware of, possibly a fourth transportation badge that
[04:45.320 --> 04:49.440]  I don't pay attention to, but the support, the key, and the owner badge are the main
[04:49.440 --> 04:50.560]  badges I think about.
[04:50.560 --> 04:52.000]  I hold a support badge.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.920]  I'm not the owner and I'm not a trimmer.
[04:53.920 --> 04:58.000]  I am somebody who is hands-on with the plants and I make decisions about what happens in
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.360]  the facility.
[04:59.360 --> 05:06.520]  Therefore, the bank has decided that they cannot offer me any type of loan or accounts
[05:06.560 --> 05:08.320]  with their establishment.
[05:08.320 --> 05:14.680]  Their reasoning for this is since my source of income, my legal employment, is federally
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.920]  illegal, they cannot risk taking my money and banking with me because they are insured
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.240]  by the FDIC, which is federal.
[05:24.240 --> 05:26.500]  My income is federally illegal.
[05:26.500 --> 05:28.480]  They are a federal institution.
[05:28.480 --> 05:33.440]  They don't want to mix my dirty, federally illegal money into their federally regulated
[05:33.440 --> 05:34.440]  institution.
[05:34.440 --> 05:38.760]  They simply smiled at me and said, thank you for coming, but we simply cannot and will
[05:38.760 --> 05:40.320]  not help you.
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.960]  I took the opportunity to ask them if they had any recommendations.
[05:43.960 --> 05:47.640]  Are there any other banks in the area that may be able to service me?
[05:47.640 --> 05:53.440]  They said that this new computer system flags everybody with a marijuana enforcement division
[05:53.440 --> 05:58.240]  badge in their computer system when they attempt to establish a new account.
[05:58.240 --> 06:00.440]  She said it is something that is linked to their computer.
[06:00.440 --> 06:03.480]  They are directly linked to the marijuana enforcement division.
[06:03.520 --> 06:08.160]  I don't think she was purposefully looking to find my badge, but it popped up and it
[06:08.160 --> 06:13.080]  did not take her two minutes of typing into that computer to have all of my information.
[06:13.080 --> 06:17.900]  And then when I played dumb about having the badge, she recited my badge number and told
[06:17.900 --> 06:20.740]  me the expiration date of my badge.
[06:20.740 --> 06:24.620]  Then she was kind enough to tell me that when that badge expires, she would be more than
[06:24.620 --> 06:29.700]  happy to open an account for me to come back in December and we can do business.
[06:29.700 --> 06:35.340]  She did also indicate that if I lower my level of my badge, that then they could write
[06:35.340 --> 06:40.440]  a letter to the bank and they would consider giving me the services that I require.
[06:40.440 --> 06:45.420]  But I don't want to reduce the level of badge I have got right now because I need that for
[06:45.420 --> 06:48.360]  my work in the legal cannabis industry.
[06:48.360 --> 06:54.500]  In a legal cannabis cultivation facility, to remain compliant, you must have a key badge
[06:54.500 --> 06:57.540]  holder on scene at all times.
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.760]  So if I am at a facility where I'm registered as an employee, I am on the employee roster
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.200]  list, I have got my key badge, nobody has to babysit me.
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.220]  They can say, go do your work, Jeff, go look at the grow, go inspect the grow, go make
[07:09.220 --> 07:11.500]  the adjustments you need to make, have a good time.
[07:11.500 --> 07:14.980]  They can give me free reign of the grow and nobody has to babysit me.
[07:14.980 --> 07:19.900]  If I only had a support badge, there would have to be somebody within visual distance
[07:19.900 --> 07:21.140]  of me at all times.
[07:21.140 --> 07:26.120]  I would not be allowed to roam around that grow or those grows or those cultivation areas
[07:26.120 --> 07:27.220]  at my own free will.
[07:27.900 --> 07:30.100]  I would need a babysitter, I would need some sort of an escort.
[07:30.100 --> 07:33.140]  I couldn't be in the cultivation facilities by myself.
[07:33.140 --> 07:38.160]  So at this time, I need that key badge so that I can function and do my job properly.
[07:38.160 --> 07:42.980]  So at this time, I am exploring more options because I am sure that there are other people
[07:42.980 --> 07:50.020]  like myself who are in the medical cannabis industry who also may own a small business,
[07:50.020 --> 07:55.740]  who also may need to get a bank loan for a vehicle, who also may need to get a bank loan
[07:55.780 --> 08:01.260]  for a new home, who also may just need banking services because we need banks in general.
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.260]  I have heard of many other people having similar experiences with banking.
[08:05.260 --> 08:07.500]  I have heard of friends having accounts shut down.
[08:07.500 --> 08:10.300]  I have seen friends have their business accounts closed.
[08:10.300 --> 08:15.300]  I have seen and heard of people being denied requests for loans and being denied the ability
[08:15.300 --> 08:17.460]  to open a new checking or savings account.
[08:17.460 --> 08:22.660]  But I have never been discriminated against like this since we have fully legalized cannabis.
[08:22.660 --> 08:26.500]  There were times when cannabis was becoming freshly legalized and people were still kind
[08:26.500 --> 08:27.500]  of weird about it.
[08:27.500 --> 08:30.780]  There were a few restaurants that would treat us weird when we showed up stinking like dank
[08:30.780 --> 08:32.460]  and paid in a bunch of cash.
[08:32.460 --> 08:37.060]  But since then, I haven't felt that kind of rejection or discrimination from a business
[08:37.060 --> 08:38.980]  and it was really uncomfortable.
[08:38.980 --> 08:40.980]  So I am looking into solutions.
[08:40.980 --> 08:44.160]  I did ask this lady if there were any other options.
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.460]  She said that credit unions may be able to help out with my situation.
[08:49.460 --> 08:53.780]  Now in many banking circumstances, people with a key badge or people with a support
[08:53.780 --> 08:57.980]  badge should be able to attain a normal checking or savings account.
[08:57.980 --> 09:02.820]  What I was trying to get was a small business checking account so that I can have a tax
[09:02.820 --> 09:06.700]  account where I just put money in for taxes and don't spend it when tax time comes.
[09:06.700 --> 09:07.940]  I've got tax money sitting there.
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.260]  It comes right out of that account.
[09:09.260 --> 09:10.640]  That was my intention.
[09:10.640 --> 09:14.300]  But this bank has refused to open my backup tax account.
[09:14.300 --> 09:17.320]  So I've just got to pay my taxes out of my normal business account.
[09:17.320 --> 09:20.920]  Not a big deal, but not what I wanted to do with my business, with my money.
[09:20.920 --> 09:24.400]  I feel like I should be able to put my money in the bank and manage my money just like
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.460]  anybody else because I worked for it legally, just like everybody else.
[09:28.460 --> 09:30.080]  It feels kind of shitty.
[09:30.080 --> 09:34.160]  This is one of the ancillary issues that we did not think about when it came to legalizing
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.200]  cannabis.
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.080]  This is going to be an issue in every new legal market.
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.440]  Until cannabis is federally legal, this will be a hurdle for everybody.
[09:43.440 --> 09:46.440]  This is a hurdle for businesses that are trying to open.
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.080]  This is a hurdle for people who work in the industry or who are trying to live a legitimate
[09:50.080 --> 09:51.080]  life.
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.200]  The people who work in these grows are not all stoner pothead bros.
[09:55.200 --> 10:00.080]  There are people of all walks of life, of all ages working in these facilities.
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.840]  There are cultivators, there are trimmers, but there are also lawyers and accountants
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.000]  and compliance managers and people who live a completely different life than anybody who
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.880]  has ever been in the illegal side of the cannabis industry.
[10:13.880 --> 10:19.080]  It is a legal business now and the majority of the people want to live like upstanding
[10:19.080 --> 10:20.280]  legal citizens.
[10:20.280 --> 10:21.620]  It's a little frustrating.
[10:21.620 --> 10:25.560]  It's a little bit of a slap in the face that we're able to go to work every day and they
[10:25.560 --> 10:28.200]  take employment taxes out of our check.
[10:28.200 --> 10:32.420]  Then all of those cannabis businesses have to pay their taxes, but when it comes to having
[10:32.420 --> 10:35.560]  a bank account, they don't want anything to do with us.
[10:35.560 --> 10:37.280]  I think that's kind of a slap in the face.
[10:37.280 --> 10:40.880]  I think it's kind of bullshit that we can't have a bank account because it's federally
[10:40.880 --> 10:44.880]  illegal, but you'll take my tax money even though it's federally illegal.
[10:44.880 --> 10:45.880]  You should pick one.
[10:45.880 --> 10:47.760]  You can't have my dirty money if it's dirty money.
[10:47.760 --> 10:48.760]  You shouldn't get it at all.
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.880]  I don't know why once you take it, it becomes clean now since it was dirty when I had it.
[10:52.880 --> 10:55.080]  That's bullshit, but that's just a side rant.
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.640]  This is going to be a problem.
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.320]  Everywhere cannabis gets legalized, so be prepared for that.
[11:00.320 --> 11:02.620]  Think about that if you were trying to open a business.
[11:02.620 --> 11:05.040]  Think about that if you were trying to be in the industry.
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.840]  Sometimes it may be challenging establishing and maintaining your credit and your bank
[11:09.840 --> 11:10.840]  accounts.
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.000]  Now, like I said a moment ago, I am looking for solutions.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.960]  Credit unions may be the option.
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.240]  I was told there are a couple of banks here in my area that will work with people in the
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.560]  cannabis industry.
[11:21.560 --> 11:26.640]  Again, most of the time it is easy to get an account if you only have the support badge
[11:26.640 --> 11:28.920]  and if you are looking for a personal account.
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.680]  My struggle is that I've got the key badge, which gives me too much access to too many
[11:33.680 --> 11:35.280]  things is what the lady said.
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.200]  She said, you've got access to everything, the safe, the money, the product.
[11:39.200 --> 11:44.120]  She said that I am too deeply involved is why they make the differential between the
[11:44.120 --> 11:45.840]  key badge and the support badge.
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.700]  But my key badge and the fact that I was trying to open a business checking account flagged
[11:51.700 --> 11:54.880]  my account and they refused to give me service.
[11:54.880 --> 11:56.840]  I left the bank unsatisfied.
[11:56.840 --> 11:59.960]  I sat there for probably an hour waiting for an appointment.
[11:59.960 --> 12:01.880]  It was a total waste of time.
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.080]  Now, there are rules and laws in the works and things are being discussed, but until
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.960]  those things are implemented, it is still going to be frustrating for some folks in
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.960]  this industry.
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.120]  All right, let's move away from banking and talk a little bit about cannabis cultivation.
[12:16.120 --> 12:19.520]  I was sent a very great message through my YouTube channel.
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.960]  Somebody commented on the YouTube channel.
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.360]  I'm scrolling through my messages right now to find it.
[12:23.360 --> 12:24.360]  Here we go.
[12:24.360 --> 12:28.200]  This one came from a person who calls themselves Real Rasher on YouTube.
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.880]  They commented on one of my videos and the comment goes like this.
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.440]  Wouldn't you harvest one branch at a time a week apart for several weeks?
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.400]  Wouldn't that also be a way to gauge a preferred maturation in one grow?
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.680]  Or would the stress of each harvest alter the remaining branches?
[12:46.680 --> 12:50.560]  So this was a question based on the Harvest Time podcast episode.
[12:50.560 --> 12:53.820]  We're talking about when to harvest and how to determine ripeness.
[12:53.820 --> 12:59.220]  This person is asking if we can harvest the plant in multiple phases, maybe taking one
[12:59.220 --> 13:04.900]  branch at a time for a week and then continuing that for multiple weeks until we have harvested
[13:04.900 --> 13:07.100]  the entire plant.
[13:07.100 --> 13:13.140]  That is an option that does work for people growing one or two plants outdoors.
[13:13.140 --> 13:17.140]  There is nothing stopping you from taking that top cola that's nice and finished that
[13:17.140 --> 13:20.100]  will allow light to get to some of those lower buds.
[13:20.100 --> 13:21.100]  It'll speed them up.
[13:21.100 --> 13:22.100]  They'll also get more light.
[13:22.100 --> 13:23.100]  They'll get fatter.
[13:23.100 --> 13:24.100]  They'll get more density.
[13:24.100 --> 13:25.500]  They'll have more overall bud there.
[13:25.500 --> 13:28.700]  It will also allow more time for them to ripen up.
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.180]  Then you can take those top buds again and maybe have a third harvest of some lower buds.
[13:33.180 --> 13:35.180]  I wouldn't really do it branch by branch.
[13:35.180 --> 13:37.140]  That's going to be a little bit too tedious.
[13:37.140 --> 13:40.420]  That's going to leave you too many days apart between your branches that are cut.
[13:40.420 --> 13:42.500]  You're going to have to be trimming a branch.
[13:42.500 --> 13:45.280]  Every day you cut, a few days later, there's more work to do.
[13:45.280 --> 13:47.420]  You cut a branch, you've got to defoliate it.
[13:47.420 --> 13:48.420]  It's going to hang.
[13:48.420 --> 13:49.580]  In a few days, it's going to dry.
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.220]  Then you've got to do work to it.
[13:51.220 --> 13:53.580]  A couple more days from there, you've got to do more work to it.
[13:53.580 --> 13:54.580]  You've got to trim it.
[13:54.580 --> 13:55.620]  You've got to dry and cure it.
[13:55.620 --> 13:59.420]  If you've got a bunch of branches that are three days apart, it's really going to make
[13:59.420 --> 14:03.140]  your drying and curing process kind of a staggered pain in the ass.
[14:03.140 --> 14:07.220]  I would do it in two, maybe three phases if you were going to stagger it.
[14:07.220 --> 14:11.660]  I would do that top, the main top section that's really done, then leave the middle,
[14:11.660 --> 14:15.300]  then take that middle when it finishes, then take the bottom if you're going to do it in
[14:15.300 --> 14:17.260]  staggered phases at all.
[14:17.260 --> 14:20.580]  I don't like this method for several reasons.
[14:20.580 --> 14:22.980]  Mainly because I am a commercial cultivator.
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.500]  When it's harvest time, I cut everything down.
[14:25.580 --> 14:30.140]  I clean the room and I refill it so there is zero downtime.
[14:30.140 --> 14:35.460]  Every square foot of space in my facility is worth dollars.
[14:35.460 --> 14:40.360]  Having plants that are just waiting to finish in some spots and not able to refill the entire
[14:40.360 --> 14:43.500]  room and start over completely gets frustrating.
[14:43.500 --> 14:49.140]  In a commercial environment, we grow plants that we know are going to be done at 63 days.
[14:49.140 --> 14:55.180]  At day 63 days, they all come down and I can refill it with more plants that take 63 days.
[14:55.860 --> 14:56.860]  I can stay on a cycle.
[14:56.860 --> 15:01.620]  I can pull 5.77 harvests per room per year on that rate.
[15:01.620 --> 15:05.980]  If I put eight week plants in there, I can pull six full harvests in there.
[15:05.980 --> 15:09.940]  But I need to stay on schedule because when I fall behind schedule, money doesn't come
[15:09.940 --> 15:11.340]  in at the time we need it.
[15:11.340 --> 15:12.940]  Then paychecks can't happen.
[15:12.940 --> 15:13.940]  Rent can't happen.
[15:13.940 --> 15:15.540]  Utility bills can't happen.
[15:15.540 --> 15:16.740]  Everything falls to shit.
[15:16.740 --> 15:18.720]  So I have to stay on schedule.
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.900]  That is my main reason for not doing this type of a thing in a commercial environment.
[15:22.900 --> 15:26.380]  I simply want to cut and clean and restart.
[15:26.380 --> 15:30.660]  And again, I also don't want my trim crew cutting half of a plant and having to deal
[15:30.660 --> 15:34.340]  with half of that plant and coming back a few days later and cutting the other half
[15:34.340 --> 15:35.340]  of the plant.
[15:35.340 --> 15:39.280]  And now we've got two different harvest batches that are one week apart and we've got to dry
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.000]  and cure these bitches a week apart.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.340]  It makes a problem when it is on a large scale.
[15:44.340 --> 15:51.240]  In your small personal grow, this would work beautifully, especially in an outdoor environment.
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.040]  Part of your question was, will this stress the plant?
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.240]  Possibly.
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.160]  Depending on the genetics of your plant, depending on how rough you are, depending on how late
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.520]  or early you decide to start chopping, this could very well stress the plant.
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.880]  If you take the top and you're a little bit too rough or you piss that plant off, you
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.920]  could cause some stress to the lower parts of the plants.
[16:13.920 --> 16:19.520]  But if all things go well, you're going to cut it down in 7 to 10, maybe 14 days anyway.
[16:19.520 --> 16:23.040]  So none of those problems will have a chance to present themselves.
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.280]  You may piss the plant off, but it's not going to hermaphrodite on you overnight.
[16:27.280 --> 16:29.960]  It's not going to spit out seeds on you overnight.
[16:29.960 --> 16:33.920]  And if it does herm on you overnight, it's not going to cause any problems that quickly.
[16:33.920 --> 16:36.960]  If you're paying attention, you'll see some hermaphrodite flowers.
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.120]  You'll be able to cut down the plant before any of those flowers cause any problems.
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.080]  And honestly, if you see hermaphrodite flowers that late into the grow, there's nothing to
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.240]  pollinate because it is way too late to pollinate that plant.
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.000]  There aren't any other plants that are available for pollen that late in the season, so it
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.680]  should not be a problem.
[16:53.680 --> 16:58.740]  So technically, yes, you could start harvesting the top and then you could wait a few days
[16:58.740 --> 17:02.120]  and you could take the middle and then you could wait another week and take the bottom
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.080]  or you could just do it in two phases.
[17:04.080 --> 17:06.480]  But I wouldn't do it branch by branch.
[17:06.480 --> 17:07.680]  That is going to be tedious.
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.380]  It's going to be frustrating and that will stress out the plant.
[17:11.380 --> 17:15.360]  But harvesting your personal outdoor crop in two or three chunks should not present
[17:15.360 --> 17:21.320]  too many problems if you have a big harvest that you can't manage by yourself in one move.
[17:21.320 --> 17:25.720]  Now I know most people are looking for peak ripeness out of their trichomes and they want
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.400]  every bud to be just perfect before they harvest.
[17:29.400 --> 17:34.280]  Unless your plant is gigantic, I don't think you're going to notice much difference in
[17:34.280 --> 17:37.660]  the buzz from the buds at the top and the buds at the bottom.
[17:37.660 --> 17:42.680]  If we cut the plant down on one day and we dry it and cure it and smoke a bud from the
[17:42.680 --> 17:46.520]  top and a bud from the bottom, even though those top buds are a little more done, I
[17:46.520 --> 17:53.720]  don't think you will notice much of a difference unless you were like an absolute super connoisseur.
[17:53.720 --> 17:56.480]  I really don't think you're going to notice much of a difference.
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.220]  And most of the time, once those buds make it to the bag or to the jar, they all mix
[18:00.220 --> 18:01.320]  up anyway.
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.360]  And then you smoke a joint and it's usually one or two buds ground up and mixed together
[18:05.360 --> 18:08.760]  or you smoke a couple of bowls and you will get the desired effect.
[18:08.760 --> 18:12.920]  So unless your plant is massive, I don't think you're going to notice much of a difference.
[18:12.920 --> 18:15.800]  I don't think it would be worth the staggered harvest.
[18:15.800 --> 18:20.080]  If that is something you want to do because you really want those trichomes dialed in,
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.240]  and if it's outdoors and there's nothing stopping you from leaving the bottom half for another
[18:24.240 --> 18:25.840]  week, go ahead and let it go.
[18:25.840 --> 18:27.080]  Have fun with it.
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.000]  Make sure you pay attention to the temperature because it is getting really cold outside
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.880]  and I don't want you to leave that second half out there and destroy it and not even
[18:34.880 --> 18:36.160]  get to harvest that.
[18:36.160 --> 18:39.640]  And also make sure that the thieves don't come and get that second half.
[18:39.640 --> 18:42.720]  When they see you take the tops down, they'll go, oh shit, he's going to take that plant
[18:42.720 --> 18:43.720]  down soon.
[18:43.720 --> 18:44.800]  We got to go get the second half.
[18:44.800 --> 18:46.360]  Pay attention for that.
[18:46.360 --> 18:50.240]  But the main reason we don't do this in an indoor situation is because we really just
[18:50.240 --> 18:53.580]  need to chop and clean up and get started again.
[18:53.580 --> 18:57.820]  And our plants aren't super massively large and an indoor cultivation facility.
[18:57.820 --> 19:01.080]  So the difference between the top and the bottom is very little.
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.160]  I don't think anybody would notice.
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.840]  And we've also selected cultivars that finish in the timeframe that we need our grows to
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.800]  run in, which is generally nine weeks in a commercial cultivation facility.
[19:12.800 --> 19:15.160]  So real rasher, I hope I answered your question.
