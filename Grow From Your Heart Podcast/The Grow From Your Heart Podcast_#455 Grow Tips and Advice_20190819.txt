[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.320]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.320 --> 00:06.160]  It is time for episode 455 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.160 --> 00:09.560]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.560 --> 00:14.080]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:14.080 --> 00:19.960]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.960 --> 00:23.440]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.440 --> 00:29.200]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia SHO Premium Rosin from our friends at Apothecary
[00:29.200 --> 00:30.200]  Farms.
[00:30.200 --> 00:39.200]  The label says that this product contains 73.2% THC and 85.5% total cannabinoids.
[00:39.200 --> 00:43.880]  Apothecary has recently started releasing the Premium Rosin, the SHO Rosin.
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.940]  I was reluctant to buy it because it is at a higher price point, and I did not want to
[00:47.940 --> 00:51.720]  fall in love with it, but I think I might be in love.
[00:51.720 --> 00:54.240]  The aroma is ridiculous.
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.320]  I always say that there is a strong aroma coming from these concentrates.
[00:58.440 --> 01:01.960]  There's something different about the Rosin concentrate.
[01:01.960 --> 01:04.480]  The aroma is more like the plant.
[01:04.480 --> 01:09.360]  It is more similar to the essence of the way that plant smelled while it was growing, and
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.080]  it's got a hint of that dried and cured plant smell as well.
[01:13.080 --> 01:16.960]  The ambrosias and the batters get the essence of the terps of what the plant smells like
[01:16.960 --> 01:19.520]  when it was alive, when it was growing, when it was fresh.
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.360]  I think the Rosin gets a fuller, more of a cannabis-flavored profile, something that
[01:24.360 --> 01:26.560]  a cannabis smoker is more familiar with.
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.680]  If you've never smoked BHO and you smoke the Rosin, you may say, what is the flavor
[01:30.680 --> 01:31.880]  coming out of that BHO?
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.260]  You may think it's fake because it is so terpy.
[01:34.260 --> 01:37.000]  The terps are so prevalent in a different way.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.640]  This Rosin has a cannabis-based flavor to it.
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.160]  Unless you've smoked a lot of concentrates, that may sound weird, but there is much more
[01:45.160 --> 01:48.440]  of a cannabis-dominant, familiar flavor to this Rosin.
[01:48.440 --> 01:49.440]  I really like it.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.100]  Of course, it's gotten me fucking rambly.
[01:51.100 --> 01:53.400]  It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.160]  Thinking about a BHO or a Diamond or a Sauce or an Ambrosia or a Shatterdab even, when
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.840]  I smoke that, it makes me feel like I'm kind of bug-eyed, like almost caffeinated off of
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.120]  the amount of THC that has entered my body so quickly.
[02:07.120 --> 02:12.320]  When I smoke the SHO, the Rosin, it makes my eyes go droopy.
[02:12.320 --> 02:13.320]  My eyes are heavy.
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.520]  My eyes feel red.
[02:14.520 --> 02:21.080]  I feel like I get really high from the BHO and I got really stoned from the SHO.
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.000]  I'm not sure if that's a good description for people that don't get to smoke every day,
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.360]  but the buzz is different.
[02:26.360 --> 02:30.560]  The feeling in my lungs are absolutely noticeably different.
[02:30.560 --> 02:33.720]  It feels a little bit thicker, a little bit heavier, which that makes sense because I
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.280]  can see the consistency of these products.
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.480]  This is almost like a heavier, thicker version of the batter that I smoke on a regular basis,
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.440]  but it is just thicker and it feels like I get ... I just need a little bit smaller of
[02:48.440 --> 02:52.440]  a dab of this and I get as much smoke and it really punches me.
[02:52.440 --> 02:53.440]  Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.480]  I didn't mean to talk about the new concentrate for two minutes, but I really appreciate the
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.920]  flavor, the aromas, the buzz.
[02:59.920 --> 03:01.040]  The flavor is crazy.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.040]  It's intense.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.040]  It just lingers on your mouth.
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.280]  It leaves that weed flavor.
[03:04.280 --> 03:06.880]  That's what I miss from the BHO.
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.740]  It leaves that cannabis that, when you used to smoke a joint, there was a flavor to it.
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.240]  That is back with the Rosin.
[03:13.240 --> 03:20.840]  Shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the Stardog Ambrosia SHO Premium Rosin.
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.560]  In this episode, I am going to answer a couple of grow questions, but before we get there,
[03:24.560 --> 03:28.520]  I would like to give some shout outs to some friends from Patreon.
[03:28.520 --> 03:30.360]  Let's start out with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:30.360 --> 03:31.360]  Shout out to Miss Mel.
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.160]  I need to send a big thank you shout out to Todd K.
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.800]  I also want to send a big thank you Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.880]  Shout out to Richard M. I also want to send a giant shout out to our buddy Steve F. Also,
[03:41.880 --> 03:46.420]  a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to my buddy Bafsta.
[03:46.420 --> 03:50.880]  As always, a shout out to our buddy Brian B. And last, but certainly not least, I want
[03:50.880 --> 03:55.160]  to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to my good friend
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.480]  Aldridge.
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.960]  I want to thank all of you for your continued Patreon support.
[03:59.960 --> 04:02.560]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to become
[04:02.560 --> 04:07.700]  a patron, all you have to do is go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[04:07.700 --> 04:11.160]  All of the information that you need will be right there on the screen.
[04:11.800 --> 04:12.880]  All right, podcast world.
[04:12.880 --> 04:16.480]  At the start of the show, I said that I was going to answer a few grow questions.
[04:16.480 --> 04:18.400]  Recently, I was asked a question by a friend.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.120]  He sent me a picture via email.
[04:20.120 --> 04:24.300]  I did not print out the message because I can cover it without printing that paper.
[04:24.300 --> 04:25.780]  So let's talk about his question.
[04:25.780 --> 04:26.780]  He sent me a picture.
[04:26.780 --> 04:28.360]  He is using a root pot.
[04:28.360 --> 04:29.760]  He's got a fabric pot.
[04:29.760 --> 04:31.520]  His plants look beautiful and healthy.
[04:31.520 --> 04:33.100]  The room looks nice and clean.
[04:33.100 --> 04:34.340]  Everything looks stellar.
[04:34.340 --> 04:37.760]  He's got his plants worked into a nice trellis, so he's developing a nice canopy.
[04:37.760 --> 04:39.640]  Everything looks real sexy in there.
[04:39.640 --> 04:44.880]  My friend's one major concern was, hey, Rasta Jeff, why do I have roots growing out of the
[04:44.880 --> 04:47.120]  bottom of my pots?
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.640]  My friend is using a root pot, like a fabric pot.
[04:50.640 --> 04:52.680]  There are many different types of them available now.
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.520]  It's just a giant fabric bag, basically, in the shape of a root pot.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.600]  So it's got a lot of breathing room for your root zone.
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.320]  It's basically a big potato sack that you fill with soil or soilless mix.
[05:02.320 --> 05:07.000]  You put your plant in there and it grows really happily because the plastic doesn't allow
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  as much airflow.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.200]  If you're using a plastic pot, you restrict a lot of airflow to your root zone.
[05:12.200 --> 05:13.680]  So your roots are growing through the medium.
[05:13.680 --> 05:15.640]  They're like, hey, there's oxygen this way.
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.680]  They go that way.
[05:16.680 --> 05:19.800]  They get to the edge of that root pot and they say, ooh, there's more air out there.
[05:19.800 --> 05:21.960]  And they grow right through that root pot.
[05:21.960 --> 05:24.080]  Those roots are looking for oxygen.
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.400]  While they're doing that, they're also looking for more food.
[05:26.400 --> 05:29.980]  Hopefully they find water and food at the end of their voyage.
[05:29.980 --> 05:35.560]  Those plants that have got the roots growing out of that bag are simply so happy that the
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.460]  roots have just grown right out of the bottom of that bag.
[05:39.460 --> 05:44.940]  You do have the possibility of those plants becoming root bound in the near future, but
[05:44.940 --> 05:49.240]  with the size of the plants that I saw and the size of the container that I saw, I don't
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.560]  think that is going to be a problem until late in flower, if not all the way to the
[05:53.560 --> 05:54.560]  end.
[05:54.560 --> 05:58.400]  I think you've chosen the right size pot for the length of which you were growing that
[05:58.400 --> 05:59.400]  plant.
[05:59.400 --> 06:03.600]  But what is happening is some of your roots are so happy and so excited that they're just
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.400]  outgrowing their space.
[06:05.400 --> 06:08.320]  They want to see what's on the other side of that wall.
[06:08.320 --> 06:10.760]  And that wall is just a little thin fabric line.
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.840]  So they were able to wiggle their way right through there.
[06:12.840 --> 06:15.520]  And now the roots are simply on the other side.
[06:15.520 --> 06:19.040]  Now the roots that I saw sticking out of the bottom of the pot were at the very bottom
[06:19.040 --> 06:23.960]  corner of the pot, where I would assume when you water that plant, a little bit of water
[06:23.960 --> 06:25.640]  stands in that area.
[06:25.640 --> 06:27.700]  You get some runoff out of the bottom of the pot.
[06:27.700 --> 06:31.320]  You probably have an inch, maybe a half inch deep worth of water just chilling there for
[06:31.320 --> 06:35.320]  a short duration of time until you either suck it up with a shop vac or it drains somehow
[06:35.440 --> 06:37.440]  or maybe you just let it evaporate.
[06:37.440 --> 06:39.240]  Whatever works in your environment works.
[06:39.240 --> 06:44.120]  But I'm thinking that those nutrients, that little puddle of water, that moisture, and
[06:44.120 --> 06:45.560]  then that dries up.
[06:45.560 --> 06:47.760]  You've got that very thin boundary for the roots.
[06:47.760 --> 06:50.680]  The roots just say, hey, this is a really cool direction for us to go.
[06:50.680 --> 06:52.600]  And they just start going that way.
[06:52.600 --> 06:55.240]  From the pictures I saw, it looked like these plants are very healthy.
[06:55.240 --> 06:56.240]  They're very happy.
[06:56.240 --> 06:59.160]  And it looks like that grow room is very well taken care of.
[06:59.160 --> 07:03.080]  So I don't think you're going to see any problems because of that root growing out of the bottom
[07:03.080 --> 07:04.080]  of that pot.
[07:04.080 --> 07:07.680]  So that is actually a sign that you were doing a very good job.
[07:07.680 --> 07:11.960]  Now if you were still in veg and the pot was smaller and the plant were larger and we knew
[07:11.960 --> 07:16.240]  that you had much more time to go in that container, that could be a concern.
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.320]  But since you were as far along as you are and those roots are that size, I think you
[07:20.320 --> 07:22.600]  were timing it just perfectly.
[07:22.600 --> 07:27.560]  When you were growing cannabis, part of your goal is to select the appropriate size container
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.520]  to be completely efficient.
[07:29.520 --> 07:31.680]  Too small of a container, you'll get root bound.
[07:31.680 --> 07:33.520]  You'll have to water way too frequently.
[07:33.520 --> 07:34.520]  It becomes difficult.
[07:34.520 --> 07:37.720]  If you're running like a one gallon pot and your plant gets big, you may have to water
[07:37.720 --> 07:39.320]  multiple times a day.
[07:39.320 --> 07:42.000]  If you've got an auto watering system, that's awesome.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.360]  If you're a home grower and you've got to water by hand and you've got multiple plants,
[07:45.360 --> 07:47.160]  that can be a pain in the ass.
[07:47.160 --> 07:50.680]  So selecting the appropriate size pot is very important.
[07:50.680 --> 07:54.080]  When you're growing in a home grow without an auto watering system and you're running
[07:54.080 --> 07:59.720]  in a soilless mix or even in cocoa, the idea is to choose the size of container to where
[07:59.720 --> 08:05.600]  when those plants are getting harvested, you want them to just achieve root bound status.
[08:05.600 --> 08:07.360]  You got to go, oh man, they're root bound now.
[08:07.360 --> 08:08.360]  Oh, it's okay.
[08:08.360 --> 08:09.360]  They're harvesting tomorrow.
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.600]  That's how you want that to time out.
[08:10.600 --> 08:15.200]  You want to fill that bottom container at the same time that the top part finishes.
[08:15.200 --> 08:19.080]  I feel like too many people overlook the importance of the root zone.
[08:19.080 --> 08:20.600]  The roots are where it all starts.
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.000]  Healthy roots, healthy fruits, fat roots, fat fruits, it all translates.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.000]  It all makes sense.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.800]  The root zone is where it's all happening.
[08:27.880 --> 08:31.760]  If you have a healthy active root zone that you're probably hopefully inoculating with
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.440]  some sort of beneficial funguses, some sort of root inoculant, that will help you reduce
[08:37.440 --> 08:40.680]  the risk of pathogens and pests.
[08:40.680 --> 08:45.440]  Those things want to go to weaker plants and healthy plants start at a healthy root zone
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.560]  that moves up through the plant and those plants don't get diseases and pests.
[08:50.560 --> 08:54.040]  And plants with a big fat healthy root system are much more forgiving.
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.120]  If you make a mistake as a grower and your plants have little shitty roots, they may
[08:58.120 --> 09:00.380]  die from a very simple mistake.
[09:00.380 --> 09:04.280]  If you've got plants with big fat lush healthy roots, you might be able to abuse them a little
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.400]  bit and they can still recover because they've got enough life source to survive.
[09:09.400 --> 09:11.960]  Now I do have a little bit of a follow up to this question.
[09:11.960 --> 09:16.840]  Somebody else said, are these mushrooms in my soilless mix a problem?
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.240]  Now I'm sure there are a lot of growers out there who have grown with sunshine mix number
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.800]  four or Fox Farms Ocean Forest, or maybe some of that 707 stuff or that roots organic stuff.
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.200]  And you have all seen those gold cap mushrooms pop up either on the top of the soil or they
[09:33.200 --> 09:35.840]  come out of the bottom of the pots where you got the little drainage holes.
[09:35.840 --> 09:39.080]  You just get a couple of smurfy looking mushrooms growing out of there.
[09:39.080 --> 09:42.640]  In my experience, those mushrooms usually pop up late in veg.
[09:42.640 --> 09:45.940]  It seems like they like the late veg environment.
[09:45.940 --> 09:48.540]  Something about the temperature, something about the humidity.
[09:48.540 --> 09:52.320]  Maybe it's something to do with the nutrients, but that is usually when I discover those
[09:52.320 --> 09:56.400]  little golden mushrooms popping up in the soilless mix.
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.180]  In my experience, those mushrooms have never been a problem.
[10:00.180 --> 10:05.300]  Those mushrooms have always appeared when my garden was at its peak optimal state.
[10:05.300 --> 10:08.820]  So if you were getting those mushrooms, you were probably doing something right.
[10:08.820 --> 10:11.660]  You have probably got a nice healthy root zone.
[10:11.660 --> 10:13.740]  You were probably watering properly.
[10:13.740 --> 10:15.220]  You're probably getting enough drainage.
[10:15.220 --> 10:17.120]  You've probably got enough oxygen.
[10:17.120 --> 10:19.440]  Your VPD is probably just right.
[10:19.440 --> 10:24.560]  I have always taken those golden mushrooms as a sign that I am doing a good job.
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.640]  I also like to let those mushrooms fall back into that soil and decompose.
[10:28.640 --> 10:31.600]  I feel like they give life back to that soil.
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.160]  And now that I'm watching that cycle happen in my head, that is probably where the mushrooms
[10:35.160 --> 10:36.160]  came from.
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.960]  There were probably just spores in that soil.
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.800]  We gave them the perfect environment.
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.160]  They decided to develop into mushrooms.
[10:42.160 --> 10:47.360]  And they are going to decompose and fall back into the soil and give our plants life.
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.600]  There is no competition between our cannabis plant and the mushroom that is growing on
[10:52.600 --> 10:53.600]  that soilless mix.
[10:53.600 --> 10:56.560]  They are using completely different things to survive.
[10:56.560 --> 10:59.600]  That mushroom will not cause any harm to your plant.
[10:59.600 --> 11:04.020]  In fact, that mushroom may actually help speed up the breakdown of some of the things that
[11:04.020 --> 11:09.080]  are in that soilless mix and make those elements more bioavailable to our plants.
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.240]  So they work sort of similarly to our little wiggler worm friends in a very different way.
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.840]  So if you've got those golden mushrooms, there is not a problem in your container.
[11:18.840 --> 11:20.040]  It is probably a good sign.
[11:20.040 --> 11:21.880]  It means that you are doing a good job.
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.160]  And those spores probably came free in your bag of soil.
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.680]  They're nothing to worry about.
[11:26.680 --> 11:29.200]  Let them keep growing until they fall over and die.
[11:29.200 --> 11:30.840]  Let them decompose.
[11:30.840 --> 11:33.440]  Then they will provide even more nutrition to your plants.
[11:33.440 --> 11:35.080]  While they're alive, they break down things.
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.040]  And once they die, they fall back into your soil, they decompose, and they continue the
[11:39.040 --> 11:40.280]  cycle of life.
[11:40.280 --> 11:43.760]  So if you've got some roots sticking out of the bottom, you're probably doing a good job.
[11:43.760 --> 11:47.040]  If you've got some golden mushrooms growing out of the top or growing out of your drainage
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.480]  holes, you are probably doing a good job with your soil.
[11:50.480 --> 11:51.480]  Keep it up.
[11:51.480 --> 11:54.180]  Now, here's another thing I should talk about while I'm on this subject.
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.220]  This was not on my notes.
[11:55.220 --> 11:58.760]  This is just something that popped into my head while I was ranting about this.
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.880]  A lot of people have begun making super soil or some sort of a living soil or a premix
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.720]  soil that doesn't require nutrients at every watering.
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.320]  Something that you just give it water and an occasional tea, and it keeps the plant
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.040]  sustained through most of its life.
[12:13.040 --> 12:15.120]  You may have to top dress at some point.
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.960]  It may be beneficial to give it specific teas to support specific phases of growth.
[12:19.960 --> 12:25.200]  But the main idea that a lot of people are heading for is a super soil mix that you premix.
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.680]  And then the idea is that you put a bunch of amendments and a base soil together.
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.500]  You mix it up and you put some water in there and you store it in a warm place.
[12:34.500 --> 12:39.360]  And that water, the air, all of those amendments and that warmth create life inside of that
[12:39.360 --> 12:43.360]  container where all of your stuff is mixed up and it becomes alive.
[12:43.360 --> 12:45.560]  That is called the cooking process.
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.160]  So when you make a super soil, basically you throw a big tarp on the floor, you'll put
[12:49.160 --> 12:53.880]  down a few bags of your base soilless mix, and then you will mix in various amendments
[12:53.880 --> 12:57.200]  based on what you want to do with your super soil.
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.700]  So whatever amendments you have chosen, we mix them up in the appropriate ratios along
[13:00.700 --> 13:02.800]  with that base soilless mix.
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.800]  Then you may sprinkle a little bit of water on it now, or you may scoop it into containers.
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.840]  Depending on how much mix you have made, some people will scoop it right into a large trash
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.840]  can.
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.160]  Some people scoop it into some of those like rubbermaid shipping or storage containers.
[13:15.160 --> 13:17.440]  Whatever container you put it in, that's up to you.
[13:17.440 --> 13:20.320]  You may need to add a little bit of water in there just to get it activated, just to
[13:20.320 --> 13:21.500]  get it moving.
[13:21.500 --> 13:23.200]  Then you want to seal it up.
[13:23.200 --> 13:25.460]  Then you want to put it in a warm place.
[13:25.460 --> 13:30.640]  The combination of the water, those live amendments, that warmth, the air in there, they all start
[13:30.640 --> 13:31.820]  creating life.
[13:31.820 --> 13:36.160]  That soil, all of those amendments start doing a process that we call cooking.
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.020]  All of the organic amendments start breaking down naturally and making themselves more
[13:40.020 --> 13:44.900]  bioavailable to our plants so that when we put a plant in this soil, we've got organic
[13:44.900 --> 13:46.620]  soil that is ready to go.
[13:46.620 --> 13:47.620]  It is enriched.
[13:47.620 --> 13:50.520]  It is well balanced, and the plants will love it.
[13:50.520 --> 13:51.900]  So you've got your stuff all mixed up.
[13:51.900 --> 13:52.940]  You throw it in your containers.
[13:52.940 --> 13:55.200]  You got just enough moisture in there to get everything alive.
[13:55.200 --> 13:56.200]  You put a lid on it.
[13:56.200 --> 13:59.880]  You throw it in a warm place, and you just leave it for a few days.
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.460]  Depending on your goal, depending on your mix, some people will let it sit for seven.
[14:03.460 --> 14:04.500]  Some will go 14.
[14:04.500 --> 14:06.000]  Some people like to go 30.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.520]  Some people like as much as a 60-day cook on their super soil.
[14:09.520 --> 14:11.400]  That is all about your preference.
[14:11.400 --> 14:12.880]  That is all about your goal.
[14:12.880 --> 14:14.240]  That is all about your amendments.
[14:14.240 --> 14:15.320]  There are many ways to do it.
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.820]  There's no wrong way unless your plants die.
[14:17.820 --> 14:19.080]  Do what works for your plants.
[14:19.080 --> 14:20.340]  Do what works for you.
[14:20.340 --> 14:21.600]  That is not the point here.
[14:21.600 --> 14:28.160]  My point is, during that cooking process, you need to check on your super soil occasionally
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.840]  to see the progress.
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.500]  Some people like to stir it.
[14:31.500 --> 14:33.360]  Some people prefer not to disturb it.
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.120]  I am not a super soil expert or a maker, so I don't have a preference on that for you.
[14:38.120 --> 14:39.680]  You have to learn that yourself.
[14:39.680 --> 14:41.200]  Read the recipe that you're working with.
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.800]  Maybe start at buildasoil.com and work your way from there, or check out Subcool SuperSoil
[14:45.800 --> 14:47.800]  Recipe and work your way from there.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.200]  See what you want to do with it.
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.400]  Add, subtract as you feel necessary, but whip up your super soil.
[14:53.400 --> 14:55.080]  Then check on it in a few days.
[14:55.080 --> 14:59.080]  Here is where people make a crucial fucking mistake.
[14:59.080 --> 15:06.480]  Your super soil should begin to grow a nice, fuzzy, white layer of funky, weird shit across
[15:06.480 --> 15:07.480]  the top of it.
[15:07.480 --> 15:09.880]  It should start off looking like maybe a little bit of a spider web.
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.960]  Then it should look like you almost have maybe powdery mildew or almost trichomes or powdered
[15:14.960 --> 15:17.880]  donuts growing across the top of your soil.
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.240]  A lot of people will freak the fuck out when they see that.
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.840]  They'll say, oh God, it's all moldy.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.080]  What do I do?
[15:24.080 --> 15:25.200]  You fucking celebrate.
[15:25.200 --> 15:26.520]  That was the goal.
[15:26.520 --> 15:28.000]  That is mycelium.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  That is the life source that we have been trying to create in that container.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.240]  You did it.
[15:33.240 --> 15:34.480]  Good job.
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.240]  The problem is a lot of people see that and they think that they have created a problem.
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.520]  They don't realize that that was the exact goal we were trying to achieve.
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.120]  If you are making a super soil, please do not freak out when you get that fuzzy white
[15:47.120 --> 15:48.120]  stuff.
[15:48.120 --> 15:51.040]  That is the magic we were trying to make happen.
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  Ta-da.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.040]  You did it.
[15:53.040 --> 15:54.040]  Good job.
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.120]  I know it sounds silly that I should even be talking about this, but you would be surprised
[15:58.120 --> 16:02.600]  at how many people I've heard say it in person, how many times I've read it in forums, and
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.880]  how many stories I've heard about people dumping out large containers of soil mix that they
[16:07.880 --> 16:12.320]  have made that they had intended on using for the next four or five runs in their garden.
[16:12.320 --> 16:14.520]  They spent an entire day mixing it up.
[16:14.520 --> 16:17.400]  They spent 30 days letting it cook.
[16:17.400 --> 16:19.280]  Then they opened it up and went, oh, I ruined it.
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.900]  They simply threw it all away or they just dumped it in the yard because they wanted
[16:22.900 --> 16:24.560]  to mix it out with yard dirt.
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.280]  They did not realize they had just created super soil, which was the goal.
[16:29.280 --> 16:30.420]  Don't be that guy.
[16:30.420 --> 16:31.420]  Don't freak out.
[16:31.420 --> 16:33.840]  If you see the mycelium, that is what you were trying to do.
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.440]  Boy, that really took longer than it was supposed to.
[16:36.440 --> 16:39.760]  Let's move forward with more grow questions.
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.200]  Another question somebody asked me about growing was, when I cut clones, why do I cut the
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.520]  tips of the leaves off of my freshly cut clones?
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.120]  When I'm taking clones to make fresh plants, I'll probably cut a six to eight inch section
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.120]  off.
[16:54.120 --> 16:56.120]  I'll get a bunch of those in a cup with some water in it.
[16:56.120 --> 16:58.520]  Then I will carry those to my cloning station.
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.480]  I will take one cutting out of the water and I give that cutting what I call a haircut.
[17:03.480 --> 17:06.360]  I will take the leaves and I will trim them down.
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.600]  The leaves are shaped like they get skinnier and then they get fatter and they get skinnier
[17:11.600 --> 17:12.600]  again.
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.720]  I cut them at the very thickest point is where I like to cut them, to where they get fat
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.800]  and then I cut them right there, to where they don't have a chance to taper back to
[17:19.800 --> 17:20.800]  skinny.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.800]  It tapers really wide.
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.200]  I cut it at the widest point.
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.160]  Now the leaves are only about half the length that they were when we started.
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.360]  Then I will cut the base of my stem at a 90 degree angle.
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.400]  I will trim that up a little bit, shave it just a little bit with my scissors.
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.680]  My point is to open up that outside flesh.
[17:37.680 --> 17:41.760]  Anything that is going to get dipped into cloning solution, if you're trying to stay
[17:41.920 --> 17:46.440]  all organic and you want to use aloe or if you're going to use olivias or if you're going
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.280]  to use clonex, whatever you choose, however far you are going to dip that clone into your
[17:51.280 --> 17:55.760]  cloning solution, I like to take my knife blade and just kind of scrape that edge of
[17:55.760 --> 17:57.640]  that clone up just a little bit.
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.440]  What I'm trying to do is open up that outside layer, open up that fiber so the roots can
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.320]  grow out of that more easily.
[18:04.320 --> 18:05.940]  They're going to grow from the inside.
[18:05.940 --> 18:09.720]  I just want to lightly scrape that outside skin off just a little bit.
[18:09.720 --> 18:12.960]  I don't want to go fucking it up and make it real rough and messy.
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.520]  That's going to give it an opportunity for problems, but I do want to scrape it and rub
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.720]  it just a little bit with my blade just to take that outside fleshy layer off.
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.000]  So I like to give them that haircut, cut them at the fattest part of the leaf, flip them
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.960]  upside down, give them a nice 90 degree angle, give them a little scraping.
[18:28.960 --> 18:30.840]  Then I put it in my clone solution.
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.720]  I use clonex most of the time in most facilities, in most applications that works for me.
[18:36.720 --> 18:39.080]  You do what works for you.
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.000]  Somebody's going to send me an email and tell me, I prefer this.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  Good job.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.400]  You use the product that is working for you.
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.200]  I love it that people have different options and that different things work for different
[18:48.200 --> 18:49.200]  people.
[18:49.200 --> 18:50.320]  You use whatever works.
[18:50.320 --> 18:52.120]  You dip your clone into that.
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.920]  Then you put that clone into, in this situation, we're going to go into a rapid rooter and
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.520]  that rapid rooter or a root riot or whatever type of plug you're going to use, they're
[19:00.520 --> 19:01.720]  all very similar.
[19:01.720 --> 19:03.380]  They will all work in my opinion.
[19:03.380 --> 19:04.380]  Whatever works for you.
[19:04.380 --> 19:05.600]  Again, you do that.
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.960]  I've got 50 rapid rooters in a tray and that tray has an insert that keeps the rapid rooters
[19:10.960 --> 19:11.960]  in place.
[19:11.960 --> 19:14.080]  They're in 10 rows of five.
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.200]  I like that amount of clones per tray because I can fill up two trays.
[19:18.200 --> 19:19.720]  I know that's a hundred clones.
[19:19.720 --> 19:21.760]  That's a really efficient amount of space.
[19:21.760 --> 19:23.080]  It works really well.
[19:23.080 --> 19:27.880]  The problem is those trays are designed to have those plugs really closely so they can
[19:27.880 --> 19:30.840]  fit 50 of them into one tray.
[19:30.840 --> 19:34.440]  The roots, the cubes work really well that closely together.
[19:34.440 --> 19:39.400]  The leaves up top kind of make a mess when you have too many of them that leafy that
[19:39.400 --> 19:40.800]  closely together.
[19:40.800 --> 19:42.500]  You get humidity issues.
[19:42.500 --> 19:45.680]  You get transpiration and respiration issues.
[19:45.680 --> 19:49.080]  Plants that are on top of each other, that are resting on top of each other really have
[19:49.080 --> 19:51.800]  a lot of potential to cause problems.
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.520]  Imagine if all day I just put my sweaty arm right across your sweaty chest.
[19:56.520 --> 20:02.440]  Just all day in the middle of the summer in a clone dome, just sweaty, sticky, stagnant.
[20:02.440 --> 20:06.440]  You're going to get pissed off at my arm in about five minutes, but you're a plant.
[20:06.440 --> 20:07.440]  You can't move it.
[20:07.440 --> 20:09.240]  You just got to sit there and deal with it.
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.600]  That's what it is like if you've got them too close together, if they're all crushed
[20:12.600 --> 20:13.600]  together.
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.400]  The first thing is they don't like being crammed together like that and it will lead to problems
[20:17.400 --> 20:18.620]  down the road.
[20:18.620 --> 20:23.360]  These clones are going to be in this dome for probably 14-ish days, maybe 10, maybe
[20:23.360 --> 20:27.120]  20, depending on your experience, depending on your cultivar.
[20:27.120 --> 20:30.280]  You've got a lot of options there, but they're going to be in there for a long enough time
[20:30.360 --> 20:34.600]  to where we need to put some care into this before we set ourselves up for failure.
[20:34.600 --> 20:38.040]  You've got the option to set yourself up for success from the beginning.
[20:38.040 --> 20:40.720]  Let's take all of the appropriate steps.
[20:40.720 --> 20:45.400]  I like to cut the tips of the leaves off because first, it prevents the leaves from resting
[20:45.400 --> 20:47.400]  on each other too ridiculously.
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.960]  There's enough foliage in there, even after I do the trim, all that excess foliage would
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.120]  just cause me problems.
[20:53.120 --> 20:54.480]  I'm getting that out of there.
[20:54.480 --> 20:57.160]  I am eliminating potential problems.
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.960]  There is another reason why I cut the tips off of those leaves.
[21:00.640 --> 21:06.040]  I feel like the less leaf there is on that plant is the less that there is to try for
[21:06.040 --> 21:07.800]  that plant to support.
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.360]  That plant doesn't have a root system.
[21:09.360 --> 21:11.360]  It was living off of the root system.
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.280]  Now, its only way to live is through the leaves.
[21:14.280 --> 21:17.400]  Now, I said that I want to cut a bunch of that leaf off, so you're like, wait, how is
[21:17.400 --> 21:18.400]  it going to live?
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.360]  Imagine if you had 12-foot arms and you had to hold the other six foot of your arm up
[21:23.360 --> 21:24.400]  all the time.
[21:24.400 --> 21:25.400]  Your arm's going to get exhausted.
[21:25.400 --> 21:29.160]  You're going to use all of your energy just trying to hold your arms out all day long.
[21:29.360 --> 21:33.360]  Now that you've only got probably two-something foot, my arms are long, so I'm 6'5".
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.240]  You probably got two-foot long arms, right?
[21:35.240 --> 21:37.280]  It doesn't take a lot of energy to hold those out.
[21:37.280 --> 21:38.280]  You can do that.
[21:38.280 --> 21:41.360]  You're not going to spend all of your calories, all of your life source, trying to keep your
[21:41.360 --> 21:42.360]  arms up.
[21:42.360 --> 21:45.640]  If you've got less plant, it's just less to sustain.
[21:45.640 --> 21:47.860]  It is less stress on the plant.
[21:47.860 --> 21:52.920]  That plant only has so much energy, so let's not make it spend so much energy keeping those
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.800]  leaves upright so it can survive.
[21:54.800 --> 21:56.480]  Let's just cut it to where they're short.
[21:56.480 --> 21:59.680]  You notice when they're shorter, they kind of want to stick up anyway, so let's trim
[21:59.680 --> 22:02.040]  them down a little bit and help them survive.
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.500]  We want to set ourselves up for success.
[22:04.500 --> 22:07.680]  By trimming those leaves, we kind of minimize transpiration.
[22:07.680 --> 22:10.520]  That gives us an advantage in the clone dome.
[22:10.520 --> 22:14.620]  I also think that when we cut those leaves, that the plant goes into sort of a panic mode
[22:14.620 --> 22:15.720]  and it sort of knows.
[22:15.720 --> 22:19.320]  It's like, hey, I better root because I'm getting all beat up up here.
[22:19.320 --> 22:22.880]  I better start doing something down here so that I can survive.
[22:22.880 --> 22:25.280]  Now there is a very fine line when cutting clones.
[22:25.280 --> 22:29.960]  We need enough leaf to keep a plant alive, but we don't want too much leaf to try to
[22:29.960 --> 22:32.420]  sustain while we don't have a root system.
[22:32.420 --> 22:36.700]  We need just enough leaf to keep the plant functioning to where it can survive without
[22:36.700 --> 22:41.320]  a root system until it develops roots, but we also don't need so many leaves that that
[22:41.320 --> 22:44.400]  plant can't sustain those leaves without a root system.
[22:44.400 --> 22:45.820]  It's a very fine line.
[22:45.820 --> 22:47.960]  We also need to think about hormones.
[22:47.960 --> 22:53.180]  Each of those leaves and shoots contain hormones that contribute to the function of the plant.
[22:53.180 --> 22:58.400]  If we leave some of the shoots and take off the leaves, we will preserve hormones and
[22:58.400 --> 23:03.620]  that will increase overall success rate of our clones in our domes.
[23:03.620 --> 23:08.300]  So it is a good idea to remove as much leaf as possible, but be mindful that you are also
[23:08.300 --> 23:09.940]  taking out hormones.
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.300]  There's a fine balance.
[23:11.300 --> 23:14.260]  Just like everything we do in cannabis, there is a balance.
[23:14.260 --> 23:15.700]  There's a pro and a con.
[23:15.700 --> 23:19.900]  There's always some kind of a balance and you always have to find the fine line.
[23:19.900 --> 23:24.420]  Most of the time it is phenotype specific, so you just have to develop a relationship
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.160]  with your plants.
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.460]  Some plants are really challenging to clone.
[23:28.460 --> 23:30.700]  Some plants will clone just by looking at them.
[23:30.700 --> 23:33.680]  You can knock a cutting off and set it in a cup of water and come back and the next
[23:33.680 --> 23:36.060]  day you got a whole fucking rooted plant.
[23:36.060 --> 23:37.580]  Some are not that easy.
[23:37.580 --> 23:42.500]  Some plants really like to be cloned in a rapid rooter and dome type of a setup.
[23:42.500 --> 23:48.580]  Some plants really prefer a turbo cloner or easy cloner, an aero cloner type of environment.
[23:48.580 --> 23:51.860]  Sometimes it is very clone specific, very strain specific.
[23:51.860 --> 23:56.820]  You may need to work on each specific cultivar and get them figured out.
[23:56.820 --> 23:59.840]  Sometimes in a commercial environment, I know which strains work well together.
[23:59.840 --> 24:01.260]  They go in this dome.
[24:01.260 --> 24:05.660]  Sometimes I'll have a dome that is only half full because it's a very specific strain that
[24:05.660 --> 24:07.460]  is just that I need 25 of these.
[24:07.460 --> 24:11.500]  I'm going to do them by their selves so that they have a better chance of surviving.
[24:11.500 --> 24:15.500]  I know they need to stay sealed up for a few more days or they need to be open sooner or
[24:15.500 --> 24:16.500]  whatever.
[24:16.660 --> 24:17.780]  Those need special attention.
[24:17.780 --> 24:22.340]  So I will fill one dome with just that one strain and treat it special on its own.
[24:22.340 --> 24:25.500]  That may be what you have to do to get your clones to root.
[24:25.500 --> 24:28.060]  That puts me off on another side tangent.
[24:28.060 --> 24:33.300]  Our friend Mr. Soul has recently reminded us to start taking the domes off of our clones
[24:33.300 --> 24:34.580]  sooner.
[24:34.580 --> 24:37.520]  Mr. Soul and I see eye to eye on many things.
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.660]  This is one of them.
[24:38.660 --> 24:44.140]  In commercial facilities, I quite often see clones in domes that the dome has been on
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.780]  there for far too long.
[24:45.780 --> 24:47.220]  We can get that dome off of there.
[24:47.220 --> 24:51.780]  We can get those clones acclimated to the environment, get them out of that clone situation
[24:51.780 --> 24:57.620]  and into some dirt much more quickly if we start burping the clones sooner and start
[24:57.620 --> 25:01.140]  gradually getting them used to that open environment.
[25:01.140 --> 25:04.700]  Then just remove the dome and let them live in that tray for a couple of days with no
[25:04.700 --> 25:06.960]  dome and they will be okay.
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.620]  So let's work on getting the clones off of the domes earlier and we will see healthier
[25:11.620 --> 25:12.980]  starting baby plants.
[25:12.980 --> 25:15.000]  What is happening is they're trapped in that environment.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  They can't thrive.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  They can't expand.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  Their roots are stuck.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  They're pissed off.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.360]  They're not getting the appropriate nutrients.
[25:20.360 --> 25:21.680]  They want to grow.
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.520]  They start getting nutrient deficiencies because they're just angry for being trapped in a
[25:25.520 --> 25:27.800]  little tiny dome in a little cube.
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.020]  So let's try to speed that process up, get them out of there.
[25:31.020 --> 25:36.300]  And once again, let's do what we can to set ourselves up for success.
[25:36.300 --> 25:40.920]  Every day of every phase counts in this new cannabis industry.
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.960]  Now since we're talking about clone domes, I've got one more great thing to add to that.
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.120]  If you were using an auto cloner, an easy cloner, a turbo cloner, whatever kind of cloner
[25:50.120 --> 25:56.080]  you were using that is an arrow cloner type machine, you do not need a dome on that clone
[25:56.080 --> 25:57.080]  machine.
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.280]  I find it really silly to put a cloner on that machine.
[26:00.280 --> 26:02.040]  I find it really detrimental.
[26:02.040 --> 26:03.400]  It kind of slows you down.
[26:03.400 --> 26:05.400]  It does more harm than it does good.
[26:05.400 --> 26:09.680]  If you were using a turbo cloner, an easy cloner, whatever brand it is, I don't care
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.560]  if it's spraying from the bottom and you're getting your roots misted from the bottom,
[26:13.560 --> 26:15.800]  you do not need a dome on that cloner.
[26:15.800 --> 26:21.160]  If you take healthy cuts and you can either cut the base of that cut at a 45 degree angle
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.160]  or for an easy cloner, what I like to do is cut that clone right up the center of the
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.160]  stick.
[26:27.160 --> 26:28.160]  I don't go too far.
[26:28.160 --> 26:29.160]  Maybe a quarter of an inch is all you need.
[26:29.160 --> 26:30.160]  Right in the middle.
[26:30.160 --> 26:31.160]  Boom.
[26:31.160 --> 26:33.360]  Now it looks like you just took your forefinger and your middle finger that are together.
[26:33.360 --> 26:36.560]  Now you just go zip and just put a little slit right between them.
[26:36.560 --> 26:39.980]  Now I think that when the water from that easy cloner sprays up there, it will start
[26:39.980 --> 26:44.260]  to roll those tips up and the roots will grow out of that little slit that you just
[26:44.260 --> 26:45.260]  made.
[26:45.260 --> 26:46.260]  It is beautiful.
[26:46.260 --> 26:48.660]  When you see it, you'll say, holy shit, that worked really well.
[26:48.660 --> 26:51.460]  So I like to cut a little slit right in the middle of it.
[26:51.460 --> 26:53.620]  Then dip it in my, I use clonex.
[26:53.620 --> 26:54.940]  We talked about this earlier.
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.580]  Use whatever solution you like.
[26:56.580 --> 26:57.580]  I use clonex.
[26:57.580 --> 26:58.580]  I dip it in there.
[26:58.580 --> 27:02.780]  Then I put it in a permaclone reusable clone collar.
[27:02.780 --> 27:03.780]  Permaclone doesn't pay me.
[27:03.780 --> 27:08.240]  I just think they're great because they're reusable and I can fit two cuts in one collar.
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.880]  So quite often you will find two clones per clone collar when I'm using a permaclone.
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.760]  So you put it in the clonex gel, you put it in your permaclone clone collar, you set it
[27:17.760 --> 27:20.320]  in the turbo cloner and you forget it.
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.260]  If you have got the nutrients in your turbo cloner dialed in correctly and you've got
[27:24.260 --> 27:29.680]  your pH in your turbo cloner dialed in correctly, you will not have to put a dome over those
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.520]  plants ever.
[27:31.520 --> 27:34.620]  That aero cloner should be spraying constantly.
[27:34.620 --> 27:39.260]  If you do run into heat issues, you can do a cycle where the pump is off and on for certain
[27:39.260 --> 27:40.260]  durations.
[27:40.260 --> 27:44.100]  Just give it time to cool so that the water doesn't heat up too ridiculously hot because
[27:44.100 --> 27:46.140]  those pumps will heat up your water.
[27:46.140 --> 27:50.060]  Depending on the size of your cloner and your environment, you may need to give it a break.
[27:50.060 --> 27:53.100]  I have had great success running it 24 hours a day.
[27:53.100 --> 27:58.540]  I have had great success running it for different intervals, maybe like 45 seconds on and 15
[27:58.540 --> 28:02.340]  seconds off, maybe 30 minutes on and 10 minutes off.
[28:02.340 --> 28:04.620]  A lot of different cycles have worked for me.
[28:04.620 --> 28:09.820]  If you've got to experiment to keep your water cool, do the experiments that are necessary.
[28:09.820 --> 28:11.180]  Let's get back on track here.
[28:11.180 --> 28:13.340]  You've got the water spraying up from the bottom.
[28:13.340 --> 28:17.580]  If you've got the pH dialed in, you've got your nutrient solution correct, you do not
[28:17.580 --> 28:19.420]  need to put a dome over those plants.
[28:19.420 --> 28:23.540]  They are going to be so happy about that water spraying up their little butt that they're
[28:23.540 --> 28:28.220]  just going to start dancing and they're going to develop roots in seven to 10 days and these
[28:28.220 --> 28:30.980]  plants will be vigorous and healthy.
[28:31.180 --> 28:37.340]  Keep in mind, I keep saying this will only work if your pH and your EC or PPMs are dialed
[28:37.340 --> 28:38.820]  in in your cloning machine.
[28:38.820 --> 28:41.460]  You have got to have the proper numbers in there.
[28:41.460 --> 28:46.220]  You have also got to maintain the proper numbers in your cloning machine.
[28:46.220 --> 28:50.700]  You have got water creating a bubbly mist all day long and spraying at the roots of
[28:50.700 --> 28:52.820]  these plants all day long in that machine.
[28:52.820 --> 28:56.060]  You can hear it from across the room.
[28:56.060 --> 28:57.340]  All day long, that thing is moving.
[28:57.340 --> 28:59.140]  The water hasn't stopped.
[28:59.300 --> 29:01.300]  You are going to get evaporation.
[29:01.300 --> 29:03.780]  You are going to get slight leaks out of that machine.
[29:03.780 --> 29:07.380]  Anybody that has ran that machine knows that there's going to be a drip from somewhere
[29:07.380 --> 29:08.620]  all the time.
[29:08.620 --> 29:10.140]  You're going to lose water.
[29:10.140 --> 29:14.100]  Also, your plants are going to be drinking some of that water.
[29:14.100 --> 29:20.020]  You are going to need to check on the water level of that machine on a regular basis.
[29:20.020 --> 29:23.700]  If you're in a commercial facility, the first thing you should do when you get there is
[29:23.700 --> 29:25.020]  check on the cloner.
[29:25.020 --> 29:26.220]  Is the pump on?
[29:26.220 --> 29:28.140]  Is it making a funny noise?
[29:28.140 --> 29:29.740]  Does it sound like it's spraying correctly?
[29:29.740 --> 29:33.700]  If it's spraying correctly, you've got to risk just a couple of seconds of your life
[29:33.700 --> 29:36.980]  and lift it up and look in there and see if any of the sprayers are clogged.
[29:36.980 --> 29:37.980]  I know it's a real bitch.
[29:37.980 --> 29:39.580]  You're going to get sprayed first thing in the morning.
[29:39.580 --> 29:40.580]  You're awake now.
[29:40.580 --> 29:41.580]  Let's get it on.
[29:41.580 --> 29:43.180]  Just lift that lid up and look and see.
[29:43.180 --> 29:44.780]  Are all the clones getting sprayed?
[29:44.780 --> 29:46.220]  If they are, you're good.
[29:46.220 --> 29:47.460]  Now you've got to unplug it.
[29:47.460 --> 29:52.580]  Now you get your EC meter or your PPM meter, whichever one you're using, and your pH meter
[29:52.580 --> 29:54.660]  and just stick them right in that nutrient solution.
[29:54.660 --> 29:55.900]  The machine is off at this point.
[29:55.900 --> 29:57.340]  You take the lid off carefully.
[29:57.340 --> 30:01.260]  Don't break the bottoms of any of those clones, but then you put your PPM or your EC meter
[30:01.260 --> 30:04.820]  in there and your pH meter in there and just test that solution.
[30:04.820 --> 30:06.140]  What are your numbers?
[30:06.140 --> 30:08.380]  Is your pH in the acceptable range?
[30:08.380 --> 30:11.160]  Are your PPMs in the acceptable range?
[30:11.160 --> 30:13.460]  If not, adjust that shit.
[30:13.460 --> 30:15.300]  Is the water at the correct height?
[30:15.300 --> 30:17.500]  If not, correct that shit.
[30:17.500 --> 30:18.500]  Write it down.
[30:18.500 --> 30:23.460]  I have a sticker on the front of my cloner that shows when my cloner was last checked
[30:23.460 --> 30:24.460]  and who checked it.
[30:24.460 --> 30:25.460]  We have little stickers.
[30:25.580 --> 30:29.500]  You just write your name, Rasta Jeff, at 420 on Monday.
[30:29.500 --> 30:30.940]  Put that little sticker on there.
[30:30.940 --> 30:32.180]  Now I'm accountable for that.
[30:32.180 --> 30:34.980]  I know that on 420 on Monday, I checked it.
[30:34.980 --> 30:36.180]  The PPMs were cool.
[30:36.180 --> 30:37.220]  The EC was cool.
[30:37.220 --> 30:38.420]  The water was cool.
[30:38.420 --> 30:39.860]  All the plants looked happy.
[30:39.860 --> 30:41.020]  Everything was fine.
[30:41.020 --> 30:45.260]  Also, I have another sticker on there that says ResClear.
[30:45.260 --> 30:47.660]  I like to put ResClear in my EasyCloners.
[30:47.660 --> 30:50.900]  That makes sure that I don't get any funky algae or anything happening in there.
[30:50.900 --> 30:52.300]  It keeps my plants nice and healthy.
[30:52.300 --> 30:55.100]  I put that in there every five days.
[30:55.100 --> 30:59.820]  I will write a little note, ResClear on Monday, January 1st.
[30:59.820 --> 31:04.380]  I know that on January 6th, I know I need to put some ResClear in there.
[31:04.380 --> 31:08.420]  My main point here is you don't need a dome on your cloning machine.
[31:08.420 --> 31:13.060]  That spray that comes from the bottom, if your nutrients and your pH and your EC and
[31:13.060 --> 31:17.300]  your PPM and your water is not too hot, if everything is dialed in, they're going to
[31:17.300 --> 31:21.540]  love getting sprayed from the bottom and they do not need a dome.
[31:21.540 --> 31:27.860]  You are only slowing yourself down by putting a dome on plants that are in an EasyCloner.
[31:27.860 --> 31:31.260]  Then you have to adjust them to the non-domed environment.
[31:31.260 --> 31:34.660]  If you don't ever give them a dome, they don't know what that life was like.
[31:34.660 --> 31:36.300]  They don't ever need it again.
[31:36.300 --> 31:40.340]  The reason we put a dome on the clones that are in the Rapid Rooters is because they're
[31:40.340 --> 31:44.620]  not getting sprayed in their little bums with constant fresh nutrient water.
[31:44.620 --> 31:47.380]  They've got to learn to develop roots to get the water.
[31:47.380 --> 31:49.020]  They've got to eat from the air.
[31:49.020 --> 31:52.940]  They've got to eat from that humidity that is kept in that domed environment.
[31:52.940 --> 31:54.220]  That is their only life source.
[31:54.220 --> 31:55.300]  They don't have roots.
[31:55.300 --> 31:58.500]  They're not getting a little bidet spray to get tickled and kept alive.
[31:58.500 --> 32:04.420]  That is why I feel it is silly and almost detrimental to your garden to put a dome on
[32:04.420 --> 32:08.060]  your clones that are in an EasyCloning type machine.
[32:08.060 --> 32:12.260]  I've got one more thing to talk about and we are going to start wrapping up this podcast.
[32:12.260 --> 32:18.100]  The last part of this episode is I do not find it necessary to put a dome on seedlings.
[32:18.180 --> 32:23.580]  I feel the same thing about clones in a clone machine as I do seedlings with a dome over
[32:23.580 --> 32:24.580]  them.
[32:24.580 --> 32:29.180]  I believe that putting a dome over a seedling will make that seedling a little bitch.
[32:29.180 --> 32:32.940]  I want that seedling to grow in the environment with the rest of the plants.
[32:32.940 --> 32:34.260]  It doesn't need a dome.
[32:34.260 --> 32:37.740]  I think putting a dome on it is like wrapping it up in bubble wrap.
[32:37.740 --> 32:39.260]  It's like nerfing my seedling.
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.700]  I want it to survive.
[32:40.700 --> 32:44.460]  I want to put a fan on my seedling so where it gets really strong and gets abused from
[32:44.460 --> 32:46.060]  the very beginning.
[32:46.060 --> 32:49.660]  I want my seedlings to grow and to know that they are not going to be babied.
[32:49.660 --> 32:53.140]  I want them to come out and go, ah shit, I better be strong or I just might not make
[32:53.140 --> 32:54.140]  it in this world.
[32:54.140 --> 32:58.180]  Now, that may be different for me because I've got experience and I have access to a
[32:58.180 --> 33:03.140]  lot of seeds and I understand that seeds are quite expensive so people really want to baby
[33:03.140 --> 33:04.900]  them and not destroy them.
[33:04.900 --> 33:09.080]  But I feel like by putting them in a dome or putting a bag over the cup with a seedling
[33:09.080 --> 33:11.780]  in it, you're kind of slowing it down.
[33:11.780 --> 33:15.220]  You're kind of giving it a participation trophy and making it a little bitch.
[33:15.380 --> 33:19.380]  So I think it would be better if we did not put domes over the seedlings.
[33:19.380 --> 33:23.500]  I also do not like to use heat mats when germinating seeds.
[33:23.500 --> 33:27.340]  I feel like that sometimes will make them too hot and you do have the opportunity to
[33:27.340 --> 33:28.420]  roast your seeds.
[33:28.420 --> 33:32.560]  If you've got them in a paper towel in the baggie and then you put them on a heat mat,
[33:32.560 --> 33:33.560]  you're going to cook them.
[33:33.560 --> 33:37.780]  I think that if you put them in a baggie and a paper towel on a plate and on top of the
[33:37.780 --> 33:41.700]  refrigerator, that is more than enough heat and you should have great success there.
[33:41.700 --> 33:45.820]  If you've got one of those old school TVs, a big box TV, who still has that shit?
[33:45.820 --> 33:50.140]  But if you've got one of those old Sony Trinitrons, the back of that bad bitch is the perfect
[33:50.140 --> 33:52.460]  heat to germinate your new seedlings.
[33:52.460 --> 33:55.140]  All right, Podcast World, this was a great episode.
[33:55.140 --> 33:58.460]  I feel like this rosin had me fucking super rambly.
[33:58.460 --> 34:01.480]  Once again, I want to give a big shout out to my friends over at Apothecary Farms for
[34:01.480 --> 34:02.820]  always taking great care of me.
[34:02.820 --> 34:06.420]  Big shout out to the entire Pueblo crew, big shout out to the Springs crew and big shout
[34:06.420 --> 34:07.860]  out to my friends up in Denver.
[34:07.860 --> 34:09.100]  I hope everybody's feeling iry.
[34:09.260 --> 34:13.740]  I hope you guys get to hear this big fist bump to the entire Apothecary family.
