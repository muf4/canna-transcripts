[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  This episode of the podcast is dedicated to my friend Zach Hayes.
[00:03.680 --> 00:04.880]  Happy birthday, bro.
[00:04.880 --> 00:06.680]  Welcome, Podcast World.
[00:06.680 --> 00:10.440]  It is time for episode 545 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.440 --> 00:15.040]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at seedsherenow.com.

[00:47.840 --> 00:51.280]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:51.280 --> 00:58.160]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Sour Best Lemons Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.880]  This is a blend of S-B-S-E and Lemon Tree Northern Lights.
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.120]  I'm not sure what S-B-S-E means, but it smells fucking amazing.
[01:07.120 --> 01:12.080]  On the package, the flavor is described as lemons, lemons, and more lemons.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.040]  Sometimes the descriptions are spot on.
[01:15.040 --> 01:16.640]  Sometimes they're questionable.
[01:16.640 --> 01:20.800]  This time, it's fucking lemons times lemons plus lemons squared.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.920]  That is accurate.
[01:21.920 --> 01:23.760]  Sour Best Lemons.
[01:23.760 --> 01:26.880]  Just opening the package and holding it a few inches from my face,
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.680]  I'm getting lemon candy, lemon pledge, and an astringent lemon punch.
[01:31.680 --> 01:34.400]  There's something real citrusy and kind of sharp getting to my nose.
[01:35.200 --> 01:36.320]  I'm putting it a little closer.
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.960]  It's got a gross, delicious lemon aroma and flavor to it.
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.760]  It is abundant and ridiculously lemon.
[01:43.760 --> 01:46.800]  I can't say lemon turps enough when it comes to this concentrate.
[01:46.800 --> 01:47.520]  It is delicious.
[01:47.520 --> 01:50.960]  When I take dabs of this, it makes my brain spin around in my head for a minute.
[01:50.960 --> 01:54.480]  There's something about the lemon turp in this that just makes my brain spin.
[01:55.040 --> 01:57.520]  Then the remaining buzz after that is tremendous.
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.200]  It keeps me nice and talkative.
[01:59.200 --> 02:06.080]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 64.61% total THC and zero CBD.
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.040]  I really dig this one.
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.680]  It is going to be a great concentrate podcast because it has got me stoned and rambly,
[02:11.680 --> 02:13.520]  and that always makes for a good show.
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
[02:16.320 --> 02:19.520]  I am going to talk about a thing I get asked quite a bit.
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.320]  In the last episode, we talked about feminized seeds.
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.440]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about male selection,
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.440]  selecting a male plant for breeding.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.520]  Many of the things I say when it comes to male plant selection
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.160]  also applies to reversing a female plant.
[02:34.160 --> 02:37.120]  I'll touch on that a little bit when it comes to the conversation.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.800]  Before we get there, let's do some shout-outs to a few of the friends
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.840]  who support the show on Patreon.
[02:43.920 --> 02:46.080]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:46.080 --> 02:46.480]  Thank you.
[02:46.480 --> 02:49.120]  Shout-out to my friend Mason662.
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.400]  I need to send a giant fist bump and a giant thank you shout-out
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.600]  to my buddy Lemur Priest.
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.160]  Bro, thank you again for the giant contribution.
[02:56.160 --> 02:56.960]  Giant fist bump.
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.000]  I'm glad I could help you out.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.680]  Thank you for helping me out.
[02:59.680 --> 03:02.480]  Let's also send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:02.480 --> 03:02.800]  Thank you.
[03:02.800 --> 03:04.560]  Shout-out to my friend Rasta K.
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.320]  Let's also send a big thank you shout-out and a fist bump to Grow Man Stan.
[03:08.320 --> 03:11.360]  I've always got a big thank you shout-out for Totally White Tops.
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.600]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Smoke What?
[03:14.080 --> 03:17.280]  Let's also send a big thank you shout-out to my friend Craig Compton.
[03:17.280 --> 03:20.160]  Also got a big thank you for North, North Terps.
[03:20.160 --> 03:22.560]  We've always got a big thank you shout-out for Vincent.
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.200]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:27.200 --> 03:27.600]  Thank you.
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.120]  Shout-out to my friend Sean23.
[03:31.120 --> 03:32.880]  Big thanks for all of the support.
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.560]  If you're not already supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how to do so,
[03:36.560 --> 03:42.640]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[03:42.640 --> 03:45.440]  All of the information you will need will be right there on the screen.
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.280]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.040]  to make it easy for all of my friends.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.520]  If you got your hands full, if you're busy, just click on that link.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.120]  It will get you right to Patreon.
[03:55.120 --> 03:58.240]  It will make it very easy for you to support the show.
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.080]  While we are talking about Patreon, I should make a short announcement, a disclaimer.
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.000]  Patreon is changing many things on their service.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.880]  One of the things they have changed is taxes.
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.040]  I don't understand completely how the taxes are going to work on Patreon.
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.680]  It is a really long thing that I need to read through and understand before I agree to anything.
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.520]  But it is something that is going to happen.
[04:21.520 --> 04:23.360]  I'm not going to stop being on Patreon.
[04:23.360 --> 04:24.480]  I have to pay them taxes.
[04:24.480 --> 04:25.840]  They've got to pay taxes.
[04:25.840 --> 04:27.680]  When money moves, Uncle Sam wants a cut.
[04:27.680 --> 04:29.360]  Somebody wants a piece of that pie.
[04:29.360 --> 04:31.680]  Every time a pie gets cooked, somebody wants a bite.
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.400]  So there will be some things happening on Patreon.
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.760]  You need to read on your contributor end and I will read on my creator end.
[04:39.840 --> 04:42.960]  We will read together and be clear of what's happening on Patreon
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.000]  so that there are no surprises at the beginning of the month.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.280]  They are making adjustments.
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.520]  While they were making adjustments, I adjusted some of the tiers and benefits to Patreon.
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.720]  Honestly, I was getting a lot of 420 contributors.
[04:57.520 --> 05:01.360]  When I say you contribute 420, they're expecting a shoutout on the show.
[05:01.360 --> 05:02.800]  I had to raise that tier.
[05:02.800 --> 05:06.160]  I moved everything up one tier because I could not keep up with the shoutouts.
[05:06.160 --> 05:07.600]  I feel like I'm falling behind.
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.280]  I did increase the tiers.
[05:09.280 --> 05:10.960]  Everything moved up by one.
[05:10.960 --> 05:15.760]  I will continue the shoutouts until I'm caught up and then I will change all of that next month.
[05:15.760 --> 05:16.480]  I'll get caught up.
[05:16.480 --> 05:20.240]  You'll get what you paid for, but in the future, some of the tiers will increase in price.
[05:20.240 --> 05:21.760]  I do apologize for that.
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.320]  It's fair to the audience because I couldn't keep up with all of the Patreon shoutouts.
[05:26.320 --> 05:27.360]  I was going to fall behind.
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.760]  People were going to give me money to say their name on the show.
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.320]  It was going to be eight episodes before I can give you a shoutout.
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.760]  That doesn't feel fair to me.
[05:33.920 --> 05:36.160]  I've just simply increased that cost.
[05:36.160 --> 05:39.840]  That will automatically slow down the amount of shoutouts I have to give.
[05:39.840 --> 05:45.200]  Maybe people will pay extra, which in turn, that will mean I have to do more episodes.
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.640]  Either way, it's going to work out for us.
[05:46.640 --> 05:49.200]  You guys, I don't want anybody to feel shortchanged.
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.800]  Since Patreon added taxes and I adjusted some things on Patreon,
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.480]  I felt that it was my responsibility to come and be straightforward about it.
[05:56.480 --> 05:57.680]  I edited some shit.
[05:57.680 --> 05:58.560]  Go take a look.
[05:58.560 --> 05:59.760]  There are new tiers available.
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.120]  There are new options.
[06:01.200 --> 06:04.240]  Thank you once again for all of the Patreon contributions.
[06:04.240 --> 06:05.920]  I do appreciate it, you guys.
[06:05.920 --> 06:08.160]  That's how I'm able to keep the show afloat.
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.560]  That's how I'm able to make sure that if this equipment goes weird,
[06:10.560 --> 06:12.720]  I've had to replace a few pieces of my equipment.
[06:12.720 --> 06:15.120]  The headphone amplifiers, they go out quite a bit.
[06:15.120 --> 06:17.360]  I try to make sure to have brand new microphone covers.
[06:17.360 --> 06:20.480]  If anybody, it's COVID times right now, so I don't have guests here on the show,
[06:20.480 --> 06:26.240]  but the Patreon pays for the Zoom account, the website account, my internet connection.
[06:26.240 --> 06:28.240]  That is the sort of stuff we're covering with Patreon,
[06:28.240 --> 06:30.160]  plus these little fuzzy microphone covers,
[06:30.160 --> 06:32.640]  so that I'm not spitting into the same one week after week,
[06:32.640 --> 06:34.800]  so that if Mike comes over, Jesse comes over,
[06:34.800 --> 06:36.400]  they're not spitting into the same one.
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.160]  Anybody I have on the show gets a freshie.
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.360]  I don't like to recycle those.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.480]  I've had a couple of pieces of equipment take a shit on me.
[06:42.480 --> 06:44.640]  We've replaced that with Patreon contributions.
[06:45.200 --> 06:48.800]  This computer, the old MacBook started making funny noises
[06:48.800 --> 06:50.960]  and I couldn't render video on that thing anymore.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.680]  I cleaned it out.
[06:51.680 --> 06:54.080]  I refurbished it as many times as I could handle.
[06:54.080 --> 06:54.880]  It was frustrating.
[06:54.880 --> 06:57.840]  It was making the show not as fun and easy to produce,
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.640]  so I used Patreon contributions to upgrade.
[07:00.640 --> 07:01.760]  I've got a fresh computer.
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.600]  This was about a year, maybe two years ago,
[07:03.600 --> 07:06.640]  but I've got a good firing up computer that works very well.
[07:06.640 --> 07:07.760]  We're on Zoom right now.
[07:07.760 --> 07:08.880]  I'm recording via Zoom.
[07:08.880 --> 07:11.600]  It's way easy for me to record and edit using Zoom.
[07:11.600 --> 07:12.960]  That's tech talk you don't care about,
[07:12.960 --> 07:15.280]  but it's real easy using the new computer,
[07:15.280 --> 07:18.800]  so the Patreon contributions are what keep the show moving smoothly.
[07:18.800 --> 07:23.760]  Also, sometimes you may help me out getting the extra four gram jar
[07:23.760 --> 07:27.040]  so that I can get nicely baked and produce a really good podcast.
[07:27.040 --> 07:28.800]  I think I do a good job when I'm nice and stoned.
[07:28.800 --> 07:31.600]  Some people, they don't work super well when you get them high.
[07:31.600 --> 07:33.040]  I've had some people that I've worked with them
[07:33.040 --> 07:35.680]  and I've taken them to lunch and allegedly given them a couple of dabs
[07:35.680 --> 07:37.840]  and I've had to take them back to work and set them in a chair
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.600]  and tell them, sit there and no fucking move
[07:39.600 --> 07:40.560]  because you're going to break something.
[07:40.560 --> 07:42.240]  It might be you or it might be some equipment,
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.320]  but don't touch anything because something will get hurt today.
[07:44.960 --> 07:46.960]  Some people like myself and like White Mike
[07:46.960 --> 07:48.720]  and like most of the crew that hangs out,
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.960]  we take a couple of dabs and we are able to function.
[07:50.960 --> 07:53.760]  I think keeping me stocked up with good dabs and good equipment
[07:53.760 --> 07:55.440]  will keep this podcast going.
[07:55.440 --> 07:59.200]  Boy, that turned into a long fucking ramble about Patreon.
[07:59.200 --> 07:59.600]  Thank you.
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.560]  That's the bottom line.
[08:00.560 --> 08:03.600]  There will be changes and I am not trying to abandon you
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.560]  or insult you or pull a fast one on you.
[08:06.560 --> 08:08.160]  I edited some shit, so go take a look.
[08:08.160 --> 08:10.560]  If you're contributing on Patreon, check out what I did.
[08:10.560 --> 08:14.480]  I simply moved the scale over one for most of the lower level tiers.
[08:14.480 --> 08:16.720]  If you're thinking you're going to get a shout out for $420,
[08:16.720 --> 08:17.520]  now they're $710.
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.760]  If you thought you were going to get your message read for $710,
[08:19.760 --> 08:20.640]  now that's $10.
[08:21.520 --> 08:22.800]  Just trying to keep up with myself
[08:22.800 --> 08:26.480]  so that I can provide the things I'm promising and not fall far behind.
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.680]  That's part of why I'm doing that.
[08:27.680 --> 08:28.160]  All right.
[08:28.160 --> 08:28.640]  Thank you guys.
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.440]  Let's move forward.
[08:29.440 --> 08:32.480]  I said that we were going to talk about male selection.
[08:32.480 --> 08:33.600]  Oh, before we get there,
[08:34.480 --> 08:37.280]  I also mentioned I am looking for music for the podcast
[08:37.280 --> 08:40.160]  and I've mentioned that I'm willing to pay and or trade or compensate
[08:40.160 --> 08:42.960]  on artist and or musician or a group for some music.
[08:42.960 --> 08:46.640]  I've gotten a couple of wonderful submissions and contributions.
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.160]  I've gotten so many that honestly,
[08:48.160 --> 08:50.080]  I can't sort through all of them right now
[08:50.080 --> 08:51.760]  and check which one I like the best.
[08:51.760 --> 08:52.960]  A couple of them got my attention.
[08:52.960 --> 08:55.200]  There's one guy that sent me like three or four options.
[08:55.200 --> 08:56.800]  I kind of like your style, bro,
[08:56.800 --> 08:59.360]  but keep them coming because I can use intros.
[08:59.360 --> 09:00.240]  I can use outros.
[09:00.240 --> 09:01.440]  I can use mid-show stuff.
[09:01.440 --> 09:03.600]  I could be playing music right now if I had a cool little,
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.600]  just something subtle that's not too much behind me.
[09:05.600 --> 09:07.520]  Just a bass line or a reggae drum beat.
[09:07.520 --> 09:08.720]  Maybe some chucking.
[09:08.720 --> 09:10.880]  If you're a musician, you know what kind of chucking I'm looking for.
[09:11.600 --> 09:13.840]  But keep the great music submissions coming.
[09:13.840 --> 09:14.800]  I will go through them.
[09:14.800 --> 09:18.640]  I've got a long appointment to get my dreadlocks worked on this week
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.160]  and I intend to take an earbud
[09:20.160 --> 09:22.160]  and just put that on while they're working on my dreads
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.120]  and listen to a bunch of shit
[09:23.120 --> 09:25.280]  and answer a bunch of emails while I'm sitting in the chair.
[09:25.280 --> 09:28.400]  I paid for three hours to sit in a chair and get my dreads twisted on.
[09:28.400 --> 09:29.840]  Also, random side note,
[09:29.840 --> 09:33.040]  a listener or a viewer on YouTube asked to see my dreadlocks.
[09:33.040 --> 09:35.120]  Bro, these dreads are a fucking mess right now.
[09:35.120 --> 09:36.000]  I've been in quarantine.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.040]  I can't get them maintained.
[09:37.040 --> 09:38.320]  I can't get them loved on.
[09:38.320 --> 09:40.800]  I can't work on them on the top of my head very well by myself.
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.200]  By the time I record another episode,
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.160]  maybe two, I will have been to the dreadlock salon.
[09:46.160 --> 09:48.400]  I have a very good dreadstress.
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.120]  I don't know what to call her.
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.240]  She's a very wonderful person.
[09:50.240 --> 09:52.240]  She does a really good job working on dreadlocks.
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.720]  She's going to do a great job fixing on my dreads.
[09:54.720 --> 09:57.920]  After that, I'll bust out the dreads and show you what they look like.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.040]  They're a fucking mess right now.
[09:59.040 --> 09:59.600]  They're real long.
[09:59.600 --> 10:00.720]  They go past my knees.
[10:00.720 --> 10:02.720]  It's tremendous, but it's worth waiting for.
[10:02.720 --> 10:04.000]  Let me get them fixed up.
[10:04.000 --> 10:04.720]  That was random.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.960]  What else are we talking about here?
[10:06.960 --> 10:09.760]  Music is coming, dreadlocks, breathing update.
[10:09.760 --> 10:10.640]  This is where we are.
[10:11.200 --> 10:14.320]  I like to share with you guys what is happening in my grow.
[10:14.320 --> 10:15.760]  If you've been following along,
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.360]  you know that recently I acquired some Jack the Ripper seeds.
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.000]  You know that I found a beautiful Jack the Ripper male within that pack of seeds.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.280]  Then you also know I found a couple of select Jack the Ripper females.
[10:27.280 --> 10:28.480]  They are in a room.
[10:28.480 --> 10:30.800]  They are successfully pollinated.
[10:30.800 --> 10:31.920]  The pistils have curled up.
[10:31.920 --> 10:33.360]  The pistils are brown.
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.360]  It looks like seeds are developing.
[10:35.360 --> 10:38.160]  There are a few other select females in that room.
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.400]  There's a golden goat.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.160]  I think I've revealed that.
[10:42.160 --> 10:44.800]  There is, of course, I put in a rise in there.
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.240]  I've got to pollinate the arise with the Jack the Ripper.
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.400]  What would I be doing if I didn't take one of Sub's best made creations,
[10:52.400 --> 10:55.600]  one of his best breeders, and put that to one of my most known creations?
[10:55.600 --> 10:58.160]  That was kind of the idea of the project, to cross those two together.
[10:58.160 --> 10:59.360]  That was the initial idea.
[11:00.160 --> 11:02.240]  Then, of course, I loaded the room up with a few others.
[11:02.960 --> 11:04.880]  I think I've revealed a couple on other episodes.
[11:04.880 --> 11:05.200]  Excuse me.
[11:05.200 --> 11:07.120]  I'm trying not to burp into the microphone here.
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.800]  I feel like I've revealed a couple of the other strains in other episodes.
[11:10.800 --> 11:11.600]  There's a golden goat.
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.720]  There's an arise.
[11:12.720 --> 11:13.920]  What else should we talk about today?
[11:13.920 --> 11:15.200]  I'm going to post a photo of it.
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.080]  There is a blueberry cookies female that has been pollinated by Jack the Ripper.
[11:20.080 --> 11:21.520]  That will be very promising.
[11:21.520 --> 11:26.800]  Both of those strains have a very beautiful shape, a very beautiful structure, great aromas,
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.160]  tremendous buzz.
[11:28.160 --> 11:29.440]  This should be a winner.
[11:29.440 --> 11:30.560]  There are a couple other things in there.
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.720]  Maybe I'll trickle out more names, more ideas as the show goes by.
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.640]  Also, I've said this before.
[11:36.640 --> 11:38.160]  Everyone's going to ask me for testers.
[11:38.160 --> 11:38.800]  Chill out, bro.
[11:38.800 --> 11:39.840]  They're just being made.
[11:39.840 --> 11:42.000]  The seeds are just forming within the calyxes.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.320]  I can see the calyxes swelling up with seeds.
[11:44.320 --> 11:45.120]  Just getting going.
[11:45.120 --> 11:45.840]  So be patient.
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.960]  I've said that before.
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.760]  I need several weeks, several, several weeks.
[11:49.760 --> 11:52.240]  They've got probably four to five more weeks to go.
[11:52.240 --> 11:53.280]  Chop them down, harvest.
[11:53.280 --> 11:53.920]  We've been over this.
[11:53.920 --> 11:56.000]  I'm not going to repeat all that, but be patient.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.120]  Testers will be coming.
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.600]  What I do like is excitement and eagerness for names.
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.800]  What do we call Jack the Ripper to blueberry cookies?
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.280]  What do we call Jack the Ripper to golden goat?
[12:07.280 --> 12:09.040]  If you've got name ideas, I would love to see them.
[12:09.040 --> 12:09.920]  You can send them to me.
[12:10.880 --> 12:13.040]  A great way to do it would be to just send them to me
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.240]  on an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.200]  or leave them in the comments on the YouTube video.
[12:19.200 --> 12:21.600]  I would love to see comments of strain names
[12:21.600 --> 12:22.960]  in the YouTube video.
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.000]  So it would be a blueberry cookies female pollinated
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.760]  by a Jack the Ripper male, a golden goat female pollinated
[12:29.760 --> 12:31.040]  by a Jack the Ripper male.
[12:32.000 --> 12:32.880]  And that's as far as we'll go.
[12:32.880 --> 12:33.920]  We'll just go for those two now.
[12:33.920 --> 12:36.000]  If you've got name ideas, throw them in the comments.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  In a future episode, I will talk about how
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.480]  I choose strain names because I'm sure you've noticed
[12:40.480 --> 12:42.800]  I've got a little bit of a theme, a scheme,
[12:42.800 --> 12:44.240]  an idea around my strain names.
[12:44.240 --> 12:46.320]  They aren't all consistent, but you can see where my mind is,
[12:46.320 --> 12:47.520]  where my brain is.
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.000]  And if you can't, I'll talk more about that in the future.
[12:50.000 --> 12:50.560]  All right, now.
[12:51.280 --> 12:53.280]  So in my breeding tent, I've got that going on.
[12:53.280 --> 12:57.200]  I think now it is time to talk about selecting male plants
[12:57.200 --> 12:58.320]  for breeding cannabis.
[12:59.520 --> 13:01.920]  I think the most important part about selecting plants
[13:01.920 --> 13:03.680]  for breeding is having a goal.
[13:04.480 --> 13:06.240]  Sure, maybe you grew some seeds and you ended up
[13:06.240 --> 13:08.160]  with a male and a female and you thought, I'll breed.
[13:08.160 --> 13:08.720]  That's fun.
[13:08.720 --> 13:09.360]  That will work.
[13:10.000 --> 13:10.960]  You're going to have success.
[13:10.960 --> 13:12.160]  You're going to make seeds.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.720]  The question is, are those seeds worth a shit?
[13:14.720 --> 13:17.040]  If you're just a hobby grower, if you're looking to supply
[13:17.040 --> 13:19.600]  yourself with some seeds to play with, that's a beautiful project.
[13:19.600 --> 13:20.480]  Have fun doing that.
[13:20.480 --> 13:21.840]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[13:23.120 --> 13:25.760]  If you want to be a little more serious about it,
[13:25.760 --> 13:28.080]  if you're somebody like myself who is putting seeds out
[13:28.080 --> 13:31.120]  for market, my seeds are available at seedsherenow.com.
[13:31.120 --> 13:33.120]  They're available at several other vendors.
[13:33.120 --> 13:35.440]  So I need to make sure that my seeds are reliable,
[13:35.440 --> 13:39.120]  that they have a reliable outcome, that they have a good germination rate.
[13:39.120 --> 13:41.680]  I need to have a goal in mind when I'm making seeds.
[13:41.680 --> 13:44.240]  Otherwise, you're just pollen chucking, which is fine.
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.240]  If that's your goal, if you want to fuck around,
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.800]  we're not all setting out to be professionals at everything we do.
[13:48.800 --> 13:50.960]  Some people just want to have a little fun making some seeds,
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.720]  growing seeds, doing it over again.
[13:52.720 --> 13:54.160]  You're self-sustainable that way.
[13:54.160 --> 13:55.280]  It's a beautiful project.
[13:55.280 --> 13:58.800]  But if you really want to lock down and get into the breeding game,
[13:58.800 --> 14:00.720]  if you really want to get serious about breeding,
[14:01.280 --> 14:03.360]  there are a few major steps you need to take.
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.200]  First of all, I really recommend,
[14:05.200 --> 14:07.120]  I didn't write this down, this is off the top of my head,
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.320]  something I thought I should include,
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.240]  read some books.
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.000]  There is a lot of knowledge just hidden in pages of books.
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.200]  And it's mostly free.
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.040]  You can get a lot of books available in PDF form on the internet now.
[14:19.040 --> 14:25.360]  If you type in breeding books by Greg Green or Mel Frank or Robert Connell Clark,
[14:25.360 --> 14:28.560]  any of those books will be filled with enough knowledge to blow your mind
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.320]  and make you a decent breeder,
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.040]  decent, well-educated person who could have a good idea of breeding.
[14:35.040 --> 14:37.280]  A lot of those books give you a lot of wonderful ideas,
[14:37.280 --> 14:39.520]  but you have to do the shit to actually understand it.
[14:40.240 --> 14:42.320]  Then once you've read some books about breeding,
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.880]  read about aleol charts and Mendel charts.
[14:44.880 --> 14:47.280]  Understand what Gregor Mendel had in mind.
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.640]  Understand what his goal was.
[14:48.640 --> 14:50.240]  Understand what he was doing.
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.520]  That will really give you more intuition on breeding.
[14:53.520 --> 14:55.040]  So read some books about breeding.
[14:55.040 --> 14:56.480]  Read about Mendel charts.
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.320]  Read, understand aleols.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.920]  Understand chromosomes.
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.800]  Understand the basic biology of plants.
[15:02.800 --> 15:04.720]  That will really give you a head start.
[15:05.200 --> 15:08.000]  Then once you understand all of that stuff and it comes time to breed,
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.120]  forget all of that shit and go with your intuition
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.400]  and take two plants that you know are going to make a positive outcome.
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.080]  I know that sounds like a lot of silly steps
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.960]  because I just told you learn a bunch of shit, then forget it.
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.560]  I am a musician.
[15:20.560 --> 15:21.600]  I'm a trained musician.
[15:21.600 --> 15:24.400]  This is a side rant that will make what I'm saying relevant.
[15:24.400 --> 15:26.640]  I understand how to read and write music.
[15:26.640 --> 15:29.120]  I can read a chart and play it while I'm breeding it.
[15:29.120 --> 15:31.920]  I can turn the page with one hand and keep the groove going and keep playing.
[15:31.920 --> 15:34.000]  I'm not bragging about my musical skill.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.320]  I'm saying I'm so comfortable at reading a chart that I can play it very well.
[15:38.320 --> 15:40.880]  When it comes concert time, we don't take the charts.
[15:40.880 --> 15:41.840]  We don't take the music.
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.560]  That's embarrassing.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.400]  You got to remember the songs on stage.
[15:44.400 --> 15:46.480]  You don't see any of whatever your favorite band is.
[15:46.480 --> 15:47.760]  They don't have music on stage.
[15:47.760 --> 15:48.720]  They're rocking.
[15:48.720 --> 15:50.160]  So I learned the music.
[15:50.160 --> 15:51.200]  I studied the music.
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.880]  I've got a very deep understanding of what each note means in that song.
[15:54.880 --> 15:57.440]  It's so ingrained in my heart that when I get on stage,
[15:57.440 --> 15:59.680]  it's intuitive and I don't make the wrong decisions
[15:59.680 --> 16:02.480]  because I've got the proper training to where my instincts
[16:02.480 --> 16:05.200]  and my education take over and the music comes out.
[16:05.200 --> 16:07.920]  Honestly, sometimes I fuck up on stage, but that's the beauty of music.
[16:07.920 --> 16:10.560]  Sometimes you can fall on your face and nobody gets hurt.
[16:10.560 --> 16:13.440]  You hope to catch the one when it comes back around and you keep fucking going.
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.600]  So now I compare that to breeding.
[16:15.600 --> 16:16.400]  Read all your books.
[16:16.400 --> 16:17.680]  Get a solid education.
[16:17.680 --> 16:21.360]  Have a solid foundation and then get out there and freestyle when the time comes
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.560]  and it should come out beautifully.
[16:23.200 --> 16:24.080]  Grow from your heart.
[16:24.080 --> 16:25.040]  Breed from your heart.
[16:25.040 --> 16:26.320]  Things will come out successfully,
[16:26.320 --> 16:28.960]  but have some sort of education and understanding what you're doing.
[16:29.520 --> 16:32.880]  With all of that being said, we need to have a goal when we are breeding.
[16:32.880 --> 16:34.000]  What is your goal?
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.760]  The goal and the traits you are seeking have a lot to do with the male plant
[16:39.760 --> 16:41.520]  you select for your breeding project.
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.160]  Your male plant is going to contribute at least 50% of his stuff to your breeding project.
[16:48.160 --> 16:51.840]  So if you're making a cake, the male is 50% of your ingredients.
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.360]  You got to have good shit to start with or this cake will never taste good.
[16:55.440 --> 17:00.720]  So let's talk about some good traits that we want to find in a male plant.
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.240]  The only way to find these traits is to grow the male plants.
[17:04.240 --> 17:07.680]  You've got to get some seeds, get a population of seeds.
[17:07.680 --> 17:09.120]  I don't know how many seeds you've got.
[17:09.120 --> 17:10.160]  I recommend a lot.
[17:10.160 --> 17:12.000]  If you can grow a lot, grow a lot.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.080]  A minimum of 10 if you're looking for a male, a lot more if you've got the space,
[17:16.080 --> 17:18.400]  the time and the legal means to do so.
[17:18.400 --> 17:19.840]  So grow a bunch of seeds.
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.520]  Then we're going to select a male out of that population of seeds.
[17:23.520 --> 17:25.520]  How are we going to select a male?
[17:26.800 --> 17:28.240]  Right away, I don't want...
[17:28.240 --> 17:31.360]  So if we take 10 plants, we pop 10 seeds, let's just say 10.
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.920]  It's easy to get your hands on a 10 pack of seeds, a 12 pack.
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.760]  A lot of breeders offer that at a fair price.
[17:35.760 --> 17:37.040]  So you've got a 10 pack of seeds.
[17:37.040 --> 17:37.760]  We grow them out.
[17:38.720 --> 17:40.720]  Most likely we're going to find out of 10,
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.440]  we're going to find somewhere between 4 and 6 males.
[17:43.440 --> 17:45.120]  We're going to remove the females from the room.
[17:45.120 --> 17:46.000]  That's another grow.
[17:46.000 --> 17:46.960]  That's another episode.
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.160]  That's another strategy.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.840]  Do whatever you want with that part of your brain.
[17:49.840 --> 17:52.240]  Right now I'm going to play with the males in this grow room.
[17:52.240 --> 17:53.600]  I've got 4 to 6 males.
[17:54.320 --> 17:56.880]  The first one that shows me it's a male
[17:56.880 --> 17:59.120]  is probably not going to be a breeding male.
[17:59.760 --> 18:02.160]  The one that is the tallest and the stretchiest
[18:02.160 --> 18:03.760]  and the proudest to get up there
[18:03.760 --> 18:06.320]  is probably not going to be my breeding male.
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.840]  Sometimes they're the same plant.
[18:07.840 --> 18:10.640]  Sometimes those are the first two males that I get rid of.
[18:10.640 --> 18:12.480]  And I'll tell you why they don't qualify.
[18:13.520 --> 18:18.080]  A minute ago, I said I want my male to be 50% of my breeding mix.
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.280]  Those big boys, they get too big right away.
[18:21.280 --> 18:23.520]  Those guys that start to pollinate immediately,
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.000]  in my opinion, they dominate the recipe too much
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.440]  and they don't show enough of the female that I use in my crosses
[18:31.440 --> 18:32.480]  when I do breeding.
[18:32.480 --> 18:34.880]  So let's say we took this male
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.520]  and I put it on a strawberry fields plant.
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.600]  We're going to say that I took a chocolate plant.
[18:39.600 --> 18:41.040]  I'm just picking two things that are different,
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.000]  chocolate and strawberry.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.960]  When I breed those, my goal is chocolate strawberry, right?
[18:44.960 --> 18:47.360]  I mean, hypothetically as a breeder,
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.720]  I'm partly chefing this.
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.320]  I want chocolate strawberry.
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.600]  If my male plant is too dominant in his genes,
[18:53.600 --> 18:54.800]  if he's too fucking raw,
[18:54.800 --> 18:57.520]  if we got a big caveman that's at the gym all the time,
[18:57.520 --> 19:00.240]  that guy is going to over dominate my mix
[19:00.240 --> 19:02.240]  and I'm going to make more chocolate.
[19:02.240 --> 19:04.000]  I'm not going to get enough strawberry out of there.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.680]  It's going to look like this guy.
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.720]  And maybe if that's what you were looking for as a breeder,
[19:08.720 --> 19:09.920]  maybe that's a success,
[19:09.920 --> 19:12.080]  but that's not what I started out for.
[19:12.080 --> 19:15.200]  So I want to find a male that flowers a little bit later.
[19:15.200 --> 19:17.920]  I want to find a male that doesn't show me flower right away
[19:17.920 --> 19:20.480]  and doesn't get real tall immediately.
[19:20.480 --> 19:22.560]  The reason the males are getting super tall
[19:22.560 --> 19:24.480]  is so they can get up above the canopy
[19:24.480 --> 19:26.560]  and drop pollen down on all of the females
[19:26.560 --> 19:28.800]  and they can be the dominant male that wins the group
[19:28.800 --> 19:30.640]  and their generations get to continue.
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.120]  So I don't choose the first or second male
[19:35.120 --> 19:36.480]  that will show me flower.
[19:36.480 --> 19:38.640]  Now we had somewhere between four and six.
[19:38.640 --> 19:41.200]  Now we're down to about four or two,
[19:41.200 --> 19:43.280]  maybe three males left to play with.
[19:43.280 --> 19:45.440]  I'm going to watch these guys grow.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.120]  I don't want any weirdo plants.
[19:47.120 --> 19:49.680]  If I've got a weirdo plant that's doing in veg,
[19:49.680 --> 19:51.840]  doing weird shapes, weird structures,
[19:51.840 --> 19:55.280]  that's not going to set myself up for success in future breeding.
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.040]  I don't want more weirdo shit.
[19:57.040 --> 19:58.560]  He's gots to go.
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.760]  Just think about it like people.
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.200]  If you see people out there,
[20:01.200 --> 20:03.440]  unfortunately, if you see some weirdo fucking people
[20:03.440 --> 20:04.640]  walking around scratching their head,
[20:04.640 --> 20:06.320]  yelling at the fucking telephone pole,
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.520]  you don't want to breed with them.
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.680]  If you see people that look like they got their shit together,
[20:09.680 --> 20:11.440]  their body is in line, they're healthy,
[20:11.440 --> 20:12.400]  they're fucking smiling,
[20:12.400 --> 20:13.680]  they got a good presentation,
[20:13.680 --> 20:15.120]  you want to breed with them, right?
[20:15.120 --> 20:16.640]  Plants should be the same way.
[20:16.640 --> 20:17.600]  If you're looking at a plant going,
[20:17.600 --> 20:19.040]  I don't know, things kind of fucked up,
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.080]  you don't want to breed with that.
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.760]  Why do you want to continue that gene?
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.120]  We're looking to make more tens.
[20:23.120 --> 20:25.120]  We don't want to make a bunch of fucking sixes.
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.560]  There are sixes out there.
[20:26.560 --> 20:29.920]  Your goal is to take maybe a six and a seven
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.440]  and make them into a 10 or make two eights into an 11.
[20:33.440 --> 20:35.280]  You got to improve when you're breeding.
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.160]  So I don't want weirdos.
[20:36.160 --> 20:37.200]  I don't want mutants.
[20:37.200 --> 20:38.640]  I don't want problematic plants.
[20:38.640 --> 20:40.720]  We'll talk about problems in a moment.
[20:40.720 --> 20:43.520]  But I want something, a male plant that isn't the tallest,
[20:43.520 --> 20:44.800]  not the first to flower
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.200]  and doesn't show me any weird growth.
[20:47.200 --> 20:49.200]  If he's got problems from the beginning,
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.520]  if he was a struggler, I may not use that one.
[20:51.520 --> 20:54.160]  I don't need struggles in my offspring.
[20:54.160 --> 20:55.920]  So before we get too far,
[20:55.920 --> 20:58.880]  make sure or I recommend to take a male
[20:58.880 --> 21:01.040]  or take a clone of your male plants
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.640]  before we go into flower.
[21:02.640 --> 21:04.000]  I found a really great male.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.360]  I call him King Solomon.
[21:05.360 --> 21:07.760]  I've also got a Jack the Ripper male that I'm playing with.
[21:07.760 --> 21:08.480]  He doesn't have a name.
[21:08.480 --> 21:10.160]  I just call it Jack the Ripper male.
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.360]  I have got clones of them
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.080]  so that when I make successful crosses with these,
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.400]  I can use them again and again and again
[21:16.400 --> 21:18.720]  because I'll keep cloning and having a father plant,
[21:18.720 --> 21:20.560]  same as a mother plant, but it's a dude.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.800]  I'll have that plant around for continued production
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.800]  so I can keep producing pollen from him
[21:24.800 --> 21:26.720]  and keep making more successful crosses.
[21:26.720 --> 21:30.640]  So I recommend that you get a clone of your favorite male.
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.800]  Now, here are things to look for,
[21:32.800 --> 21:35.200]  traits that we want to seek in our male,
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.720]  the shape and the structure.
[21:37.600 --> 21:39.760]  Do you want squat and bushy plants?
[21:39.760 --> 21:41.280]  Do you want tall and skinny plants?
[21:41.280 --> 21:43.360]  Do you want plants that make one main cola?
[21:43.360 --> 21:44.400]  Because that is an option.
[21:44.400 --> 21:46.880]  If you're running a whole bunch of plants on a table
[21:46.880 --> 21:48.240]  and you just want to turn them and burn them,
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.800]  you can put 64 plants on a four by four table.
[21:50.800 --> 21:52.560]  They grow up to make one main stock.
[21:52.560 --> 21:55.760]  You flip them real early, you get 64 10 gram buds.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.760]  It's 640 grams from one light.
[21:57.760 --> 21:59.520]  Not bad at all in my opinion.
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.120]  You can breed plants to do that.
[22:01.680 --> 22:03.680]  Do you want tall plants?
[22:03.680 --> 22:04.720]  Do you want skinny plants?
[22:04.720 --> 22:05.760]  Do you want bushy plants?
[22:05.760 --> 22:07.040]  Do you want big white leaves?
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.720]  Do you want little skinny leaves?
[22:08.720 --> 22:10.400]  You can breed that into your plants.
[22:10.400 --> 22:12.960]  It's all about the selection that you make with your parents.
[22:13.840 --> 22:16.160]  You want branchy and sturdy plants.
[22:16.160 --> 22:17.600]  Do you want branchy and sturdy plants?
[22:17.600 --> 22:20.080]  I want branchy plants with lots of good structure,
[22:20.640 --> 22:22.480]  close internodal spacing,
[22:22.480 --> 22:25.600]  nice beefy branches that will hold up big buds.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.960]  I want male plants that are going to make big fat male clusters.
[22:28.960 --> 22:31.120]  That will translate to big female buds
[22:31.120 --> 22:33.360]  when it comes down to the progeny in the future.
[22:34.080 --> 22:37.520]  So something I don't like is a hollow plant.
[22:37.520 --> 22:40.720]  If I've got a male plant and I top it and that center is hollow,
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.080]  you can feel them when you're working with them.
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.400]  I can look at them and see them from across the room.
[22:44.400 --> 22:47.040]  I do not select a hollow male plant.
[22:47.040 --> 22:48.320]  That is just something I don't like.
[22:48.320 --> 22:50.800]  I prefer it to not be the super hollow plant.
[22:50.800 --> 22:53.840]  So all about the structure and the leaf shape.
[22:53.840 --> 22:55.680]  Do you want short squatty plants?
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.840]  Do you want big branchy plants?
[22:57.840 --> 23:00.800]  Some people, I like those taller, longer branchier plants.
[23:00.800 --> 23:02.320]  I get a lot more production out of them.
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.360]  I work in commercial grows where we trellis them and work them around.
[23:05.360 --> 23:08.640]  I can manipulate those plants to give me a lot of flowers.
[23:08.640 --> 23:10.240]  So it's all about what you want.
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.080]  Find a male that represents the structure you would like to recreate
[23:14.080 --> 23:18.720]  because that male is going to give at least 50% of its structure to the offspring.
[23:18.720 --> 23:19.840]  So keep that in mind.
[23:20.400 --> 23:23.040]  Also think about odors, aromas.
[23:23.600 --> 23:24.880]  What does it smell like?
[23:25.920 --> 23:27.600]  It's only going to be half of the mix.
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.080]  And keep in mind, think about when you grow plants in veg,
[23:30.080 --> 23:31.600]  you rub the stem, it smells kind of weird.
[23:31.600 --> 23:34.160]  But when you dry it and cure it, it doesn't smell like that.
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.520]  But there is consistency in the way those aromas change.
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.920]  If it smells like puke when you're rubbing the stem,
[23:40.160 --> 23:43.200]  it's going to have gassy, skunky aromas toward the end of flower.
[23:43.200 --> 23:45.520]  If it smells like sweet feet and berries,
[23:45.520 --> 23:48.800]  it's going to smell like fruit and blueberries and shit toward the end of flower.
[23:48.800 --> 23:50.960]  These are just things that you'll experience as you go along.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.880]  I like to rub the stems.
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.400]  I like a male, personally, that smells a little bit like puke.
[23:58.400 --> 24:01.920]  I know it sounds horrible, but they make great breeders.
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.760]  I like a male plant that when I rub the stem early in veg or late in veg,
[24:05.760 --> 24:08.320]  it smells a little bit like the bar trash can.
[24:08.320 --> 24:15.040]  Fermented, funky, disgustingness always translates into a good breeding male, in my opinion.
[24:15.040 --> 24:19.200]  Also, a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of chem, and a little bit of skunk.
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.440]  I love that male plant for breeding.
[24:21.440 --> 24:24.000]  It's going to make wonderful fucking offspring.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.760]  But that is my goal.
[24:25.760 --> 24:28.480]  Maybe you want something that is the complete opposite.
[24:28.480 --> 24:30.560]  Maybe you want something that smells like peaches.
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.800]  Maybe you want something that smells like watermelons.
[24:32.800 --> 24:34.400]  I don't know what you're into.
[24:34.400 --> 24:35.760]  Find the one that works for you.
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.600]  That is a big part of breeding.
[24:37.600 --> 24:38.880]  A lot of breeding is science.
[24:38.880 --> 24:41.760]  I talked about read all the books, learn all the charts, do all that shit.
[24:41.760 --> 24:45.360]  Then I said forget it all because that is where it comes to an art form also.
[24:45.360 --> 24:46.960]  We are making a lot of decisions.
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.400]  They have to be educated, but they also have to be artful with a goal.
[24:50.400 --> 24:52.480]  There are a lot of things to keep in mind, you guys.
[24:52.480 --> 24:54.000]  So we're talking about aromas.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.760]  Let's talk about colors.
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.800]  I really like a colorful male plant.
[24:58.800 --> 25:02.960]  If your male plant is making purple, he's probably going to make purple offspring.
[25:02.960 --> 25:06.400]  If that male plant is making reds and golds and oranges,
[25:06.400 --> 25:08.240]  you've got to let them flower a little while.
[25:08.240 --> 25:10.720]  A lot of people cut down the male plants way too early.
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.200]  Let them go seven, eight, nine weeks.
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.440]  See what you've got there because that's when you're going to see the true traits of that male plant.
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.000]  You'll see colors that you never, ever imagined would be produced by that male plant
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.160]  when you cut it down at week five and six.
[25:24.160 --> 25:26.880]  You know, when you start flushing your females, they start turning gold.
[25:26.880 --> 25:28.720]  They get the yellow on the outside of the leaf.
[25:28.720 --> 25:30.800]  They get the red and the orange down the center of the leaves.
[25:30.800 --> 25:32.800]  They start making beautiful purples and shit.
[25:32.800 --> 25:34.560]  Your male plants will do that.
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.560]  If you don't give them the opportunity to grow that long, you'll never, ever know it.
[25:38.560 --> 25:39.600]  Look for colors.
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.680]  Reds, pinks, purples, different shades of greens.
[25:43.680 --> 25:44.800]  What do you like?
[25:44.800 --> 25:47.680]  Some of those different colors will translate in the offspring.
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.520]  You may get 25% of your offspring may show that color.
[25:51.520 --> 25:52.640]  Maybe 50%.
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.840]  Maybe up to 75% of your offspring will have that color depending on the traits of the female,
[25:57.840 --> 26:00.480]  depending on how dominant and recessive that trait is.
[26:00.480 --> 26:01.440]  Look for colors.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.160]  If you've got something that puts off some purples,
[26:04.160 --> 26:06.720]  it is very, very good to breed with that plant.
[26:06.720 --> 26:08.960]  In my opinion, if purple is what you're going for.
[26:09.680 --> 26:11.840]  Here is something you should really look for.
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.840]  If one of your male plants is putting off trichomes, that's a bad motherfucker.
[26:15.840 --> 26:17.440]  You should use him in breeding.
[26:17.440 --> 26:19.280]  The male plant is putting off trikes.
[26:19.280 --> 26:21.920]  That's kind of, it's not rare, but it's not super common.
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.520]  You'll find that in about three out of 10 keepers, they'll put off trichomes.
[26:25.520 --> 26:27.600]  If you've got a boy that's putting off resin,
[26:27.600 --> 26:30.800]  the female that he pollinates will put off resin.
[26:30.800 --> 26:34.000]  The seeds, I mean, the seeds that come from that, they will put off resin.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.120]  If you've got a good resin producing female and a good resin producing male,
[26:37.120 --> 26:38.800]  you put those together, guess what?
[26:38.800 --> 26:39.440]  Double resin.
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.680]  You just made a double resin Oreo right there.
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.200]  So if you've got a trichomed male, use that guy because it is going to work very well,
[26:47.200 --> 26:48.640]  in my opinion.
[26:48.640 --> 26:54.560]  Something else we should think about when it comes to selecting a male plant is flowering time.
[26:54.560 --> 26:57.040]  How long, let's also talk about veg time.
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.480]  How did the plant grow in veg?
[26:58.480 --> 27:00.000]  Did it explode with growth?
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.760]  Was it slow and shitty and lanky?
[27:01.760 --> 27:02.640]  Was it problematic?
[27:02.640 --> 27:04.080]  Did it give you any issues?
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.520]  Did it need support too early?
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.440]  Were the stalks nice and robust?
[27:07.440 --> 27:10.800]  But we should think about flowering time and veg time.
[27:11.600 --> 27:14.880]  And the amount of time you veg most of your plants, did this plant keep up?
[27:14.880 --> 27:15.680]  Was it smaller?
[27:15.680 --> 27:16.720]  Was it bigger?
[27:16.720 --> 27:17.920]  Was it average?
[27:17.920 --> 27:18.640]  Think about that.
[27:18.640 --> 27:20.720]  Then when you put it into flower, how did it react?
[27:20.720 --> 27:23.200]  How long did it take to show you that it was a male?
[27:23.200 --> 27:26.240]  Did it try to show you that it was a male way before you flowered it?
[27:26.240 --> 27:28.960]  Did it become root bound and start putting off male flowers?
[27:28.960 --> 27:30.480]  I would not breed with that.
[27:30.480 --> 27:32.240]  So think about flowering time.
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.200]  How long from the time you induced flower to the time you started seeing male parts?
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.320]  Then how long until those male parts started opening up?
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.440]  Then how long until peak pollination time?
[27:43.440 --> 27:47.680]  Pay attention to that stuff because that is going to correlate and relate to the flowering
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.360]  time of your offspring.
[27:49.360 --> 27:53.040]  That's why I like to let the males go for quite a while, seven, eight, maybe nine or
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.000]  ten weeks.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.840]  If that male plant keeps growing and stays nice and healthy and keeps getting huge towards
[27:57.840 --> 28:02.240]  eight or nine weeks, your offspring could take eight or nine, maybe 10 or 11 weeks.
[28:02.240 --> 28:03.920]  So pay attention to that male plant.
[28:03.920 --> 28:04.720]  Grow it out.
[28:04.720 --> 28:09.040]  I know a lot of breeders and a lot of growers do not grow out male plants far enough to
[28:09.040 --> 28:10.480]  see what they've got to work with.
[28:10.480 --> 28:11.680]  So please do that.
[28:11.680 --> 28:12.000]  Try it.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.160]  You may be amazed at what you see.
[28:15.440 --> 28:17.680]  How long does it keep spitting out pollen?
[28:17.680 --> 28:19.360]  As a breeder, it's got to spit out.
[28:19.360 --> 28:22.560]  If you're going to breed commercially and put the seeds out, it's got to spit out enough
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.400]  pollen to make it worth your time.
[28:24.400 --> 28:27.440]  That's why feminized seeds are so damn expensive.
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.440]  When you reverse a plant, you've got to be very careful about how you do it and you don't
[28:31.440 --> 28:36.160]  get near as much pollen as you do from a well-selected male plant.
[28:36.160 --> 28:37.680]  So that's a big difference there.
[28:37.680 --> 28:38.960]  Make sure you're getting enough pollen.
[28:38.960 --> 28:40.800]  How long does it continue to spit out pollen?
[28:40.800 --> 28:43.600]  And do you get enough pollen to make it worth your breeding time?
[28:44.720 --> 28:46.240]  Let's talk about issues.
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.880]  Things that would make me not select a male plant.
[28:48.880 --> 28:50.560]  I mentioned before a hollow plant.
[28:50.560 --> 28:52.320]  I don't like a hollow male plant.
[28:52.320 --> 28:55.040]  I don't like a slow, shitty grower.
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.600]  If it takes a long time to veg, if it's got issues, if it doesn't handle some abuse, I'm
[28:59.600 --> 29:00.480]  not going to breed with it.
[29:00.480 --> 29:03.280]  If it's weak and spindly, it cannot hang out.
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.320]  Also, I mentioned earlier, if it's too robust, if it's too dominant, if we got fucking Hulk
[29:08.320 --> 29:11.680]  Hogan or the Ultimate Warrior in there, I may not choose that one for breeding because
[29:11.680 --> 29:15.200]  I'm just going to make a bunch more Ultimate Warriors, a bunch more Hulk Hogan's, a bunch
[29:15.200 --> 29:17.680]  more testosterone-ridden fucking super beasts.
[29:17.680 --> 29:18.880]  That's not what I'm looking for.
[29:19.520 --> 29:24.080]  Also, does this male plant respond well to feeding and pH issues?
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.680]  I kind of abuse my male plants a lot like I do the females.
[29:27.680 --> 29:29.440]  Feed them poorly, see how they react.
[29:30.160 --> 29:32.160]  Fuck up the pH, see how they react.
[29:32.880 --> 29:34.240]  See if they get PM.
[29:34.240 --> 29:36.240]  See if they are attracted to pests.
[29:36.240 --> 29:38.640]  Some plants, the bugs just love to come around.
[29:38.640 --> 29:42.160]  As soon as you start growing some plants, the spider mites go, what's that new smell?
[29:42.160 --> 29:43.280]  Larry, this thing smells good.
[29:43.280 --> 29:44.080]  Let's go invade.
[29:44.080 --> 29:45.120]  And they all go get it.
[29:45.120 --> 29:46.720]  So see if it brings bugs.
[29:47.600 --> 29:50.720]  Something I mentioned earlier, does it auto flower?
[29:50.720 --> 29:55.360]  Does anything cause this male plant to go into flower before you have flipped the lights
[29:55.360 --> 29:56.560]  to 12-12?
[29:56.560 --> 30:00.800]  If it got a little bit root-bound and decided to auto flower, don't breed with it.
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.880]  If it got a little bit underfed and it decided to go flower on you, get rid of it.
[30:06.880 --> 30:07.520]  Don't breed with it.
[30:07.520 --> 30:11.600]  If it's auto flowering on you, that is going to continue over into the progeny and your
[30:11.600 --> 30:13.360]  customers will not be happy.
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.960]  Like I said earlier, if you're breeding for yourself, you can do whatever you want as
[30:16.960 --> 30:19.600]  long as you are aware of what could happen.
[30:19.600 --> 30:21.120]  You are making your own creations.
[30:21.120 --> 30:22.720]  You're not going to share them with anybody.
[30:22.720 --> 30:25.600]  But if you're putting them out to market, they need to be reliable.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.880]  They need to be more consistent.
[30:26.880 --> 30:30.320]  Let's make sure I'm still recording because my computer just did some weird shit.
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.520]  I'm not even going to edit this out yet.
[30:31.520 --> 30:32.000]  We're still going.
[30:32.000 --> 30:32.560]  We're cool.
[30:32.560 --> 30:33.200]  All right.
[30:33.200 --> 30:34.400]  I just got a notification.
[30:34.400 --> 30:35.760]  I've got my notifications turned off.
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.440]  So that was whack, but you didn't hear it.
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.400]  We'll keep moving.
[30:38.400 --> 30:40.000]  I apologize for the distraction.
[30:40.000 --> 30:40.800]  Where are we?
[30:40.800 --> 30:41.360]  Auto flower.
[30:41.360 --> 30:43.360]  You don't want one that auto flowers.
[30:43.360 --> 30:48.400]  Another thing to think about is were there problematic plants within that seed stock?
[30:48.400 --> 30:51.360]  Did you grow out females and find problems in the females?
[30:51.360 --> 30:55.440]  Because it's most likely that you grew a population of girls who were looking for that keeper.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.200]  What'd you see in those girls?
[30:57.200 --> 30:58.960]  Was there a hermaphrodite?
[30:58.960 --> 31:04.160]  Were there intersex traits amongst the female population which you found from the same seed pack?
[31:04.160 --> 31:09.520]  If so, that gives me a little suspect, a little question, a little apprehension to breed with
[31:09.520 --> 31:13.600]  that plant that tells me there is intersex traits within the seed line.
[31:13.600 --> 31:16.080]  Somewhere in that DNA, it is possible.
[31:16.080 --> 31:18.000]  I don't know that I want to pass that.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.360]  It could be a recessive trait.
[31:19.360 --> 31:20.720]  It could be a dominant trait.
[31:20.720 --> 31:22.800]  It may pop up in the next generation.
[31:22.800 --> 31:24.640]  It may pop up two generations from now.
[31:24.640 --> 31:26.240]  It may not pop up at all.
[31:26.240 --> 31:29.520]  I don't know that I would set myself up with that time bomb.
[31:29.520 --> 31:31.280]  That's kind of a problem waiting to happen.
[31:31.920 --> 31:35.040]  So were there problems in the rest of the seed stock?
[31:35.040 --> 31:36.080]  Did you have any trouble?
[31:36.720 --> 31:38.160]  Were there hermaphrodites?
[31:38.160 --> 31:38.960]  Were there freaks?
[31:38.960 --> 31:41.360]  Were there mutants in the other seed stock?
[31:41.360 --> 31:43.520]  That's just something to keep in mind as a breeder.
[31:43.520 --> 31:44.880]  That's something I like to think about.
[31:44.880 --> 31:48.080]  I also really like to know the parents of my breeding stock.
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.480]  Like I know what made King Solomon.
[31:50.480 --> 31:54.160]  I made King Solomon and I know what made the parents that made those parents.
[31:54.160 --> 31:55.920]  So I know far down the line.
[31:55.920 --> 31:57.760]  I know the grandparents of my breeding stock.
[31:57.760 --> 32:00.800]  I know the great-grandparents of some of my lines that are out.
[32:00.800 --> 32:02.880]  So I just really like to know what's going on.
[32:02.880 --> 32:05.040]  Then there aren't many surprises.
[32:05.040 --> 32:06.320]  Then I have less.
[32:06.320 --> 32:09.600]  I've got the more data you have, the less surprises you're going to have is what I think
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.320]  I'm trying to say.
[32:11.040 --> 32:14.080]  So where are we now on my list?
[32:14.080 --> 32:15.200]  Herms pollinate.
[32:15.200 --> 32:18.880]  The next step to do I think is to select qualifying females.
[32:20.080 --> 32:22.320]  Briefly, females that are not hermaphroditic.
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.760]  Females that are not problematic.
[32:23.760 --> 32:28.400]  Females that are resistant to pests and problems and pathogens and molds and mildews and issues.
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.800]  Plants that can take a beating.
[32:30.800 --> 32:33.120]  Plants that you've got a goal for breeding them to.
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.440]  Maybe you just want to make some new seeds.
[32:35.440 --> 32:40.560]  But if you notice in my breeding, I am using things that are very dominant in flavors.
[32:40.560 --> 32:43.680]  And then I'm using a male that is very dominant in potency.
[32:43.840 --> 32:50.000]  I put my potent male on flavorful odoriferous females and I get potent and terpy plants
[32:50.000 --> 32:50.560]  out of that.
[32:50.560 --> 32:53.040]  So select quality females.
[32:53.040 --> 32:54.480]  Then pollinate.
[32:54.480 --> 32:58.720]  Earlier I mentioned that a lot of this talk would work on a reversed plant as well.
[32:59.280 --> 33:04.800]  If you've got a female that fits this criteria, that grows well, has a good structure, doesn't
[33:04.800 --> 33:09.520]  hermaphrodite, smells great, branchy, sturdy, has the node spacing and the shape and leaf
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.920]  structure you're looking for, you can reverse that.
[33:11.920 --> 33:16.800]  That is a very good candidate for making a feminized seeds.
[33:17.360 --> 33:18.880]  Make sure it's not a hermaphrodite.
[33:18.880 --> 33:21.680]  Beat it up, abuse it, stress it, light stress it.
[33:21.680 --> 33:25.600]  In the last episode, I talked about how I stress test my fem seeds, my female plants
[33:25.600 --> 33:27.200]  before I make fem seeds.
[33:27.200 --> 33:27.840]  Do that.
[33:27.840 --> 33:28.640]  See if it herms.
[33:28.640 --> 33:33.120]  If it doesn't give you any issues, that plant will work very well as a pollen donor plant
[33:33.120 --> 33:33.920]  to be reversed.
[33:34.640 --> 33:37.360]  So we've got our male or we've got our reversal.
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.560]  Our next step is to get the plants to the right stage and pollinate.
[33:40.560 --> 33:46.000]  The females are going to need to be around day 18, 23, 25, depending on the cultivar.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.280]  I've got one plant that wants pollen like 27, day 30 sometimes.
[33:49.920 --> 33:53.360]  So it's all about the female when her pistils are nice and ripe, when she's ovulating and
[33:53.360 --> 33:54.640]  wants to get pollinated.
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.960]  The male plant, depends on the male plant you've selected, probably around day 14, 17,
[33:58.960 --> 34:02.400]  21 up to day 32-ish, you're going to be getting pollen.
[34:02.400 --> 34:02.960]  Pollinate.
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.680]  Keep documentation of pollination times.
[34:07.680 --> 34:10.080]  Write down when the pollen starts.
[34:10.080 --> 34:11.520]  I flipped on day one.
[34:11.520 --> 34:13.440]  On day seven, I saw male sacks.
[34:13.440 --> 34:15.360]  On day 12, pollen was coming out.
[34:15.360 --> 34:16.640]  Write that down.
[34:16.640 --> 34:19.200]  Then write down peak pollination time.
[34:19.200 --> 34:21.920]  When did this plant really start dumping pollen?
[34:21.920 --> 34:27.440]  Then also, if you can keep it around long enough, document when the plant stopped dumping
[34:27.440 --> 34:27.760]  pollen.
[34:27.760 --> 34:30.640]  That's also important to know your window.
[34:30.640 --> 34:32.320]  How long do I get to make pollen?
[34:32.960 --> 34:34.080]  So document that.
[34:34.080 --> 34:38.880]  Then also document the day you pollinate your plants so that you know how long you've got
[34:38.880 --> 34:41.520]  to grow these plants and how long those seeds take to develop.
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.200]  The more data, the more success you will have in the future.
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.760]  You can set patterns and you can set expectations and you can make corrections based on your
[34:49.760 --> 34:50.480]  data.
[34:50.480 --> 34:52.000]  Write down a lot of shit.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.360]  So get your females at their peak point for pollination.
[34:55.360 --> 34:56.640]  Pollinate them.
[34:56.640 --> 34:57.680]  It's very easy.
[34:57.680 --> 35:00.160]  If you don't do much, the male will pollinate the room on his own.
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.240]  If you've got a fan in there, every night his fucking flowers open up and pollen, he
[35:04.240 --> 35:06.880]  goes, and his little dusts of pollen fly out everywhere.
[35:07.440 --> 35:11.520]  If you haven't pollinated everything already, turn off the fans, take that male to the center
[35:11.520 --> 35:12.720]  of the room and just shake him.
[35:12.720 --> 35:15.520]  And it's fucking, it'll be ridiculous.
[35:15.520 --> 35:17.840]  If you've got a nice male, there will be a lot of pollen in there.
[35:17.840 --> 35:18.880]  You're going to have to clean yourself up.
[35:18.880 --> 35:20.720]  You're going to get green boogers from all the pollen.
[35:20.720 --> 35:22.000]  You'll sneeze for a couple of days.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.040]  It's well worth it.
[35:23.040 --> 35:24.560]  So we have pollinated.
[35:24.560 --> 35:25.840]  Continue to feed the seeds.
[35:25.840 --> 35:27.040]  Feed the plants as normal.
[35:27.600 --> 35:29.600]  I don't give them big bloom boosters.
[35:29.600 --> 35:31.360]  I reduce the bloom boosters.
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.200]  I'm not trying to make big fat buds.
[35:33.200 --> 35:35.360]  I increase my cow mag a little bit.
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.560]  I continue with nitrogen and I do add a little bit of amino acids when I'm making seeds.
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.040]  Amino acids are really good for starting life and getting those seeds nice and healthy.
[35:45.040 --> 35:48.080]  I also make sure to just take really good care of the plants overall.
[35:48.080 --> 35:49.840]  Their overall health is really important.
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.960]  Make sure they're pH and fed and watered and defoliated and fucking loved for properly.
[35:54.960 --> 35:56.480]  And you'll have happy seeds.
[35:56.480 --> 35:59.680]  I do a few other tricks that I've talked about in other episodes, but we're not going to
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.880]  delve too far into that.
[36:00.880 --> 36:02.880]  We're going to keep talking about selecting a male.
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.600]  So now the seeds are ready for harvest, right?
[36:05.600 --> 36:06.240]  Time goes on.
[36:06.240 --> 36:06.880]  We've got seeds.
[36:06.880 --> 36:08.400]  We chop them and we cut them.
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.560]  The next important thing to do is to grow these seeds.
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.640]  We don't know if this male plant we have selected is worth a shit until we grow these seeds.
[36:18.640 --> 36:19.760]  Now I'm going to branch off.
[36:20.800 --> 36:27.200]  Some people are going to want to try multiple male plants to the same female plant for breeding.
[36:27.200 --> 36:28.640]  I don't like that idea.
[36:28.640 --> 36:33.680]  I honestly don't see a way that you're going to stop pollen from male plant A and male
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.280]  plant B and male plant C from cross-contaminating your female plant.
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.200]  So when you grow the offspring, you never know which male plant was the champion.
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.960]  You just wonder who to baby daddy and you don't know which male plant to breed with
[36:44.960 --> 36:45.520]  again.
[36:45.520 --> 36:47.440]  And it's kind of a waste of time in my opinion.
[36:47.440 --> 36:49.840]  Pick one male plant, breed with him at a time.
[36:49.840 --> 36:51.040]  That is my advice.
[36:51.040 --> 36:53.600]  In my opinion, I think I've been successful.
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.400]  And so my words may have some weight.
[36:57.200 --> 36:58.880]  I've been successful with that advice, you guys.
[36:58.880 --> 36:59.840]  That's all I'm saying.
[36:59.840 --> 37:02.240]  But run the seeds that you've grown.
[37:02.240 --> 37:06.160]  You've got a batch of seeds from either one female or multiple females.
[37:06.160 --> 37:06.560]  Run them.
[37:06.560 --> 37:07.440]  See what you've got.
[37:07.440 --> 37:09.040]  Check the germination rate.
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.360]  How many seeds, if you can germinate 10 of them, how many popped when you put them in
[37:13.360 --> 37:14.800]  your germination method?
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.920]  Did you get 9 out of 10?
[37:15.920 --> 37:16.720]  You get 8 out of 10?
[37:16.720 --> 37:17.520]  Or are you a champion?
[37:17.520 --> 37:18.560]  All 10 germinated.
[37:18.560 --> 37:19.120]  Check that out.
[37:19.840 --> 37:21.600]  Germination rate is very important.
[37:22.240 --> 37:23.200]  Then grow them.
[37:23.200 --> 37:24.320]  Watch them grow.
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.240]  Do they look like fucking mutant plants?
[37:26.240 --> 37:28.800]  Do they look like they're going to have struggles the entire time?
[37:28.800 --> 37:30.080]  Do they look like good plants?
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.440]  Flower them.
[37:31.440 --> 37:33.520]  Do they make good buds?
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.000]  Are the plants that you just created better than both of the parents that you started
[37:38.000 --> 37:38.160]  with?
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.200]  Because if not, there's no point in continuing this line unless it is doing something magical
[37:43.200 --> 37:43.680]  for you.
[37:43.680 --> 37:46.480]  When you smoke it, if you feel perfect, keep it.
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.760]  But the goal is to improve upon the two lines that we started with.
[37:49.760 --> 37:51.280]  So you've got to grow them out.
[37:51.280 --> 37:52.400]  Look for hermaphrodites.
[37:52.400 --> 37:53.520]  Look for intersex traits.
[37:53.520 --> 37:54.800]  Look for problems.
[37:54.800 --> 37:55.680]  Are there mutants?
[37:55.680 --> 37:56.560]  Is it worth a shit?
[37:56.560 --> 37:58.160]  Does it take too long to flower?
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.600]  Are they very inconsistent?
[37:59.600 --> 38:00.960]  Are they very uniform?
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.400]  You can have positive and negative things to document at this time.
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.560]  But we've got to be sure that we have improved on the quality of the line of cannabis.
[38:10.560 --> 38:12.320]  That is our main goal here as a breeder.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.640]  If you haven't made it better, there's no point in breeding.
[38:14.640 --> 38:21.120]  So you either need to F2 these seeds to make them better or abandon the project altogether.
[38:21.120 --> 38:23.280]  If you're giving them out, let your friends know.
[38:23.440 --> 38:26.000]  These aren't the best seeds that I've ever made, but they are free.
[38:26.000 --> 38:26.880]  So you can have them.
[38:26.880 --> 38:27.600]  You can give them away.
[38:27.600 --> 38:28.640]  You can share them.
[38:28.640 --> 38:31.040]  But set the expectation when you give them away.
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.360]  Don't say, these are fucking amazing seeds.
[38:33.360 --> 38:34.880]  Go, hey, these are okay.
[38:34.880 --> 38:35.360]  They're good.
[38:35.360 --> 38:36.960]  I mean, be honest with yourself.
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.960]  I have made some okay seeds.
[38:38.960 --> 38:42.080]  You don't see them at any of the vendors because they are okay.
[38:42.080 --> 38:43.440]  I only put out the champs.
[38:43.440 --> 38:45.840]  And if they don't show to be champs after I put them out for a while,
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.200]  if I don't see a lot of great success, I will discontinue them for sales.
[38:49.200 --> 38:50.800]  And I will give them away as freebies.
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.400]  I'll pass them out to my friends.
[38:52.400 --> 38:55.680]  If you stop by the booth when I'm out somewhere in public and you say, hey, what's up?
[38:55.680 --> 38:58.800]  Maybe I'll just pass you a pack of them for freebies, but I don't sell them.
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.240]  I don't make a profit off of the B's or the nines.
[39:02.240 --> 39:06.480]  I put out 10s and 11, you guys, and that should be your goal as well as a cannabis breeder.
[39:10.710 --> 39:12.310]  If you're listening on audio, I apologize.
[39:12.310 --> 39:13.350]  I just took a long drink.
[39:13.350 --> 39:14.390]  I was getting real dry.
[39:14.390 --> 39:15.990]  If you're watching the video, big up.
[39:15.990 --> 39:17.110]  Thank you for sticking with me.
[39:17.910 --> 39:18.550]  All right.
[39:18.550 --> 39:22.150]  So the main important part is have a goal, have something in mind.
[39:22.150 --> 39:23.830]  Do you want to make endicodominant plants?
[39:23.830 --> 39:25.430]  Do you want to make sativa dominant plants?
[39:25.430 --> 39:26.950]  Are you aiming for a certain cannabinoid?
[39:26.950 --> 39:28.390]  Are you aiming for a certain terpene?
[39:28.390 --> 39:30.550]  Are you aiming for a certain growth structure?
[39:30.550 --> 39:31.590]  What is your goal?
[39:31.590 --> 39:33.270]  Have a goal in mind when you're crossing.
[39:33.990 --> 39:37.190]  Select a male that will fit your criteria for your goal.
[39:37.190 --> 39:39.430]  I understand we don't all have unlimited seeds.
[39:39.430 --> 39:42.790]  Find something that works the best out of the pack of seeds you've got.
[39:42.790 --> 39:45.430]  Pay attention for dominant traits or positive traits.
[39:45.430 --> 39:47.030]  Pay attention for negative traits.
[39:47.030 --> 39:49.430]  Decide if that's the plant you want to breed with.
[39:49.430 --> 39:50.070]  Do the work.
[39:50.070 --> 39:50.790]  Breed with it.
[39:50.790 --> 39:52.070]  Chuck that motherfucking pollen.
[39:52.070 --> 39:53.430]  Let those plants have their action.
[39:53.830 --> 39:55.270]  Then you've got to grow the seeds.
[39:55.270 --> 39:57.750]  That is where the real test of your work comes in.
[39:57.750 --> 40:01.190]  See if your progeny, if your offspring, if your children are worth a shit,
[40:01.190 --> 40:04.470]  or if you just need to get rid of that male and start all over again.
[40:05.190 --> 40:06.630]  That's not a bad decision.
[40:06.630 --> 40:09.030]  That is a very respectable and reputable decision.
[40:09.030 --> 40:10.790]  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[40:10.790 --> 40:11.430]  Get rid of it.
[40:11.430 --> 40:12.150]  Don't do that.
[40:12.150 --> 40:13.510]  Some things just won't work.
[40:13.510 --> 40:14.790]  That is the way the numbers work.
[40:15.510 --> 40:17.030]  Sometimes you get amazing crosses.
[40:17.030 --> 40:19.590]  Sometimes you get a whole bunch of bullshit.
[40:19.590 --> 40:20.470]  So it's all up to you.
[40:20.470 --> 40:21.510]  It's all about your goal.
[40:22.470 --> 40:23.830]  Try your best to reach your goal.
[40:23.830 --> 40:26.390]  And if you don't reach your goal, don't be afraid.
[40:26.390 --> 40:27.110]  Try, try again.
[40:27.110 --> 40:30.310]  Like I said before, when we're growing plants, when we're playing music,
[40:30.310 --> 40:33.110]  if we crash and fuck up, the best part is you don't get hurt.
[40:33.110 --> 40:35.750]  It may cost time and money, but you get to get up and try it again.
[40:36.630 --> 40:37.110]  All right.
[40:37.110 --> 40:41.750]  I think that concludes my male selection podcast episode.
[40:41.750 --> 40:44.390]  If I left anything out, if you've got any more questions,
[40:44.390 --> 40:48.070]  I do encourage feedback, questions, criticism.
[40:48.070 --> 40:48.950]  Send it my way.
[40:48.950 --> 40:50.630]  You can leave it in the YouTube comments.

[41:07.430 --> 41:09.590]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[41:09.590 --> 41:12.470]  friends and foes, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[41:12.470 --> 41:13.750]  all you bad motherfuckers out there.

[42:47.110 --> 42:48.470]  It goes up on Stitcher.
[42:48.470 --> 42:51.830]  I don't know why Spotify is blocking some of my episodes.
