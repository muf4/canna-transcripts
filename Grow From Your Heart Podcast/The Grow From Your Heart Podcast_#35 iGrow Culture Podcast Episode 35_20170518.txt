[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  What's up, cannabis community?
[00:01.960 --> 00:06.640]  My name is Ross DeGeff, and it's time for episode number 35 of the Agro Culture Podcast.
[00:06.640 --> 00:12.840]  In the last episode, I talked about a proposed regulation coming down in Pueblo, Colorado.
[00:12.840 --> 00:16.820]  We talked about going to a city council meeting to prevent these regulations, and city council
[00:16.820 --> 00:20.040]  has changed the date of their next meeting.
[00:20.040 --> 00:23.240]  The city's agenda did say the meeting was on Monday, but recently they've changed the
[00:23.240 --> 00:24.240]  date.
[00:24.240 --> 00:28.000]  The date is now on Tuesday, October 14th at 7 p.m.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.440]  So come down to One City Hall Place in Pueblo, Colorado, Tuesday, October 14th at 7 p.m.
[00:35.440 --> 00:38.200]  Public comment will be allowed during the public forum for those who sign up before
[00:38.200 --> 00:39.200]  the meeting.
[00:39.200 --> 00:43.520]  So if you plan to speak, show up around 6.30 and sign up.
[00:43.520 --> 00:46.040]  Please come and help fight these regulations.
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.680]  What they're trying to do is not allow us to grow in our homes or in our backyards.
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.680]  They're trying to require us to make an outbuilding to grow in, which I don't find fair.
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.960]  So please join us at a city council meeting Tuesday at 7 p.m.
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.200]  If you want to speak, please show up around 6.30.
[01:01.200 --> 01:02.200]  I'll be there.
[01:02.200 --> 01:03.200]  Mike will be there.
[01:03.200 --> 01:04.200]  Jesse will be there.
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.400]  There should be quite a few of us there.
[01:05.400 --> 01:06.560]  We hope to see you there.
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.200]  All right, let's get on with the podcast.
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.200]  Jesse came over.
[01:10.200 --> 01:13.280]  Actually, I'm waiting for Jesse while I record this, to be honest with you.
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.840]  Jesse will be here any minute now, and we are finally going to do the episode about
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.600]  drying and curing your cannabis.
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.500]  So hang on just a second while I do some ads, and hopefully Jesse will show up by the time
[01:24.500 --> 01:27.180]  I get done with this.
[01:27.180 --> 01:28.380]  Where do we want to start?
[01:28.380 --> 01:32.100]  This episode is brought to you by our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:32.100 --> 01:36.300]  If you're dabbing high-quality concentrates, you deserve a high-quality titanium nail.
[01:36.300 --> 01:39.500]  Don't trust a Chinese nail or an American knockoff made of cheap metals.

[02:36.420 --> 02:37.420]  I've got the message right here.

[02:52.580 --> 02:55.180]  What it says is, it's to help a homeless shelter in my area.

[03:11.500 --> 03:12.500]  I lost my rhythm.
[03:12.500 --> 03:13.540]  Don't know where I was in that read.
[03:13.540 --> 03:14.900]  So let's move on to the next one.
[03:14.900 --> 03:18.180]  This podcast is brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[03:18.180 --> 03:22.140]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.
[03:22.140 --> 03:27.900]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street or stop by the Pueblo location at 618 East
[03:27.900 --> 03:30.140]  4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[03:30.140 --> 03:34.260]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor growing supplies.
[03:34.260 --> 03:35.940]  Guys, I shop at Hygro.
[03:35.940 --> 03:38.060]  I wouldn't advertise something that I don't trust in.
[03:38.060 --> 03:41.420]  Speaking of not advertising something I don't trust in, I'm talking about this highly educated
[03:41.420 --> 03:42.420]  nail.
[03:42.420 --> 03:43.420]  I deserve a dab.
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.860]  So grab a dab with me and hopefully by the time I get done with that, our good friend
[03:45.860 --> 03:49.100]  Jessie will be here to talk about drying and curing your cannabis.
[03:49.100 --> 03:52.820]  All right, guys, I'm back after a couple of tremendous dabs.
[03:52.820 --> 03:54.020]  Forgot to do a couple things.
[03:54.020 --> 03:58.740]  I want to give a huge shout out to Joey Coco Diaz and also my good friend Clint.
[03:58.740 --> 04:02.700]  Clint and I went up to Denver to the Denver Improv on Thursday night, and we saw Joey
[04:02.700 --> 04:05.580]  Coco Diaz do an amazing set of comedy.
[04:05.580 --> 04:07.260]  Joey's one of my favorite comedians.
[04:07.260 --> 04:11.400]  He freaking crushed the Denver Improv, and it was awesome.
[04:11.400 --> 04:13.560]  After the show, he took a few minutes to hang out with Clint and I.
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.800]  Well, he hung out with everybody, but then Clint said something to him that got his attention,
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.560]  so he hung out with Clint and I for quite a while and bullshitted one on one.
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.560]  When he was walking away, he patted me on the shoulder, and he said, Ross the Jeff,
[04:25.560 --> 04:28.000]  you know I love you, right, cocksucker?
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.120]  For Joey Diaz to call you a cocksucker is actually an honor.
[04:31.120 --> 04:32.680]  So it was great, and I had a good time.
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.080]  So big shout out to Joey Diaz.
[04:34.080 --> 04:35.360]  Thanks for the great and amazing show.
[04:35.360 --> 04:37.360]  Thanks for hanging out with me for an hour after the show.
[04:37.360 --> 04:38.920]  Hey, Clint, thanks for going with me, dude.
[04:38.920 --> 04:40.040]  That was a good time.
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.360]  We need to go to more comedy shows together.
[04:42.360 --> 04:44.320]  Also make sure you check out the Wild Cousins.
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.760]  That's Clint's comedy group that he is a part of.
[04:47.760 --> 04:52.440]  So if you are a listener, a regular listener, you'll remember that around episode 30, I
[04:52.440 --> 04:57.040]  said that I would start paying a dollar every time I say the F word because I'm trying to
[04:57.040 --> 04:59.680]  not say the F word on the podcast.
[04:59.680 --> 05:04.120]  I need somebody to go back and listen from episode 30 to 34 and let me know how many
[05:04.120 --> 05:05.520]  dollars I owe.
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.000]  There's a sick child in need, and I had a conversation with one of his parents.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.680]  I think it was his uncle.
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.440]  And I said that I would help them out when the time came up.
[05:13.440 --> 05:15.800]  And so this is my obligation to them.
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.440]  I know it's only a dollar, but what I'm going to do now, starting on episode 35, every time
[05:20.440 --> 05:23.360]  I say the F word, it costs me $5.
[05:23.360 --> 05:28.400]  I will donate $5 to this sick kid, this sick child, and try to help out their life a little
[05:28.400 --> 05:29.400]  bit.
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.680]  What I'll need though, I need somebody to tweet me or email me or let me know when I'm
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.680]  doing it.
[05:34.680 --> 05:38.080]  So the way you can do that, you can tweet me at igrowculture.
[05:38.080 --> 05:41.080]  You can email me, igrowculture at hotmail.com.
[05:41.080 --> 05:43.200]  You can Facebook me.
[05:43.200 --> 05:44.200]  It's just igrowculture.
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.000]  And just let me know how many times I'm saying this.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.760]  And from 30 to 34, it's $1.
[05:49.760 --> 05:52.520]  From 35 on, it's going to be $5.
[05:52.520 --> 05:54.080]  And it does not count to the guests.
[05:54.080 --> 05:56.680]  The guests can come and they can say whatever they want.
[05:56.680 --> 05:59.720]  So somebody start tallying it up for me and send me a bill.
[05:59.720 --> 06:04.440]  I'm going to contact these people once I've got a total, and then I will let them know
[06:04.440 --> 06:05.440]  that I want to do this.
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.400]  And if they accept the donation, I'll send it to them.
[06:07.400 --> 06:12.360]  And also if they are willing or if they want me to reveal their identity, I will.
[06:12.360 --> 06:14.760]  And that way you guys can see who I'm helping out.
[06:14.760 --> 06:17.440]  All right, I got one more ad to do.
[06:17.440 --> 06:20.200]  This podcast is brought to you by our friends at TreeThugger.com.
[06:20.200 --> 06:25.160]  TreeThugger.com, live music lifestyle magazine for concert, festival, news, and reviews.
[06:25.160 --> 06:26.160]  Check out TreeThugger.com.
[06:26.160 --> 06:30.800]  I'm going to send a personal shout out to Ryan from Tree Thugger.
[06:30.800 --> 06:33.200]  Dude, I see what you're doing with yourself and I'm proud of you, man.
[06:33.200 --> 06:35.360]  I wish you the best.
[06:35.360 --> 06:38.000]  You guys, I am still looking for that theme song.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.040]  If anybody has made a theme song for me, please shoot it to me and send it to me at igrowcultureathotmail.com.
[06:43.040 --> 06:47.080]  If you just want to send an instrumental, I can do all the voiceovers and say the name
[06:47.080 --> 06:48.400]  of the show and all that stuff.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.960]  I would appreciate it and I'd definitely make it worth your time.
[06:50.960 --> 06:54.400]  You guys, I'm going to take a couple more dabs and when I get back, we'll do a lesson
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.120]  on drying and curing your cannabis.
[06:56.120 --> 07:00.520]  I just got a text message and it's Jesse and he says he will be here in five minutes.
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.520]  Hang on, you guys.
[07:01.520 --> 07:03.440]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[07:03.520 --> 07:05.040]  Guess who finally decided to show up?
[07:05.040 --> 07:06.560]  Our good buddy Jesse Grose is back.
[07:06.560 --> 07:07.560]  How are you doing tonight, bro?
[07:07.560 --> 07:08.560]  Pretty good.
[07:08.560 --> 07:09.560]  Fashionably late.
[07:09.560 --> 07:10.560]  Fashionably late.
[07:10.560 --> 07:11.560]  You got a lot of fashion in you.
[07:11.560 --> 07:12.560]  Tons of it.
[07:12.560 --> 07:13.560]  No worries, bro.
[07:13.560 --> 07:16.200]  I was just chilling out, putting together a really nice episode.
[07:16.200 --> 07:19.680]  The people have been asking for the dry and cure episode.
[07:19.680 --> 07:22.600]  I think they will be proud of what we bring them today.
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.600]  Awesome.
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.280]  Jesse actually said that he could use a little, what is it, a primer lesson?
[07:27.280 --> 07:28.280]  Is that what it's called?
[07:28.280 --> 07:29.280]  Yeah, sure.
[07:29.280 --> 07:30.280]  On how to cure some herbs?
[07:30.280 --> 07:33.640]  I've never been real happy with any of my cure jobs.
[07:33.640 --> 07:44.480]  I've been told they're great, but I feel like I have a lot of room for improvement there.
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.800]  Your standards on your own product are always higher than everybody else's, your own expectations.
[07:48.800 --> 07:49.800]  You know what I mean?
[07:49.800 --> 07:54.200]  I'm never satisfied with my herb or anything and everyone's like, that was amazing.
[07:54.200 --> 07:56.520]  Especially when I play music, I'm like, that could have been better.
[07:56.520 --> 07:58.920]  And they're like, no, dude, you nailed it.
[07:58.920 --> 08:03.680]  I can feel the same thing snowboarding as well.
[08:03.680 --> 08:08.040]  Me on a snowboard, it's like trying to put a telephone pole on a snowboard.
[08:08.040 --> 08:11.040]  It's just a lot of me rolling down a hill with my face.
[08:11.040 --> 08:13.480]  Oh man, I thought you snowboarded actually.
[08:13.480 --> 08:18.160]  I do, but I spend more time on the lift and on my ass than I do on the actual board.
[08:18.160 --> 08:19.600]  I can't do it anymore.
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.480]  The left knee disagrees with the snowboard now.
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.520]  It feels like my left knee wants to fly out of the socket the entire time I'm strapped
[08:26.520 --> 08:27.520]  in.
[08:27.520 --> 08:30.120]  I can't ski for a similar reason.
[08:30.120 --> 08:31.960]  They told me to move to skis.
[08:31.960 --> 08:33.760]  They said it wouldn't hurt as bad if I skied.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.760]  Possibly.
[08:34.760 --> 08:35.760]  Maybe I'll try that this winter.
[08:35.760 --> 08:36.760]  Case to case.
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.760]  My snowboard friends have moved away.
[08:37.760 --> 08:38.760]  Miss you guys.
[08:38.760 --> 08:39.760]  Hope you're listening.
[08:39.760 --> 08:42.960]  So we're here to talk about curing herb, not talking about curing ourselves.
[08:42.960 --> 08:45.200]  Actually, I guess curing herb will cure ourselves.
[08:45.200 --> 08:47.840]  I'm talking into a circle because I'm really dabbed out.
[08:47.840 --> 08:48.840]  Really dabbed out.
[08:48.840 --> 08:49.840]  Really, yeah.
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.720]  We are setting a new record for dabbing.
[08:51.720 --> 08:55.760]  We burned out the e-mail, I think, and had to switch over to the regular rig.
[08:55.760 --> 08:58.600]  The e-mail couldn't keep up with the puddles we were putting on it, and I think it took
[08:58.600 --> 08:59.600]  a shit today.
[08:59.600 --> 09:00.600]  So hey, Giddy Up.
[09:00.600 --> 09:01.600]  Remember what you're telling me?
[09:01.600 --> 09:02.880]  Shout out to Giddy Up.
[09:02.880 --> 09:04.560]  I ran into Giddy on Chat Roulette.
[09:04.560 --> 09:05.760]  That was amazing.
[09:05.760 --> 09:08.000]  And you said something about sending me a g-nail, homie.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.180]  So don't forget, because my nail just took a shit, so that'd be great timing.
[09:12.180 --> 09:13.180]  We want to cure some weed.
[09:13.180 --> 09:14.180]  That's why everybody's listening.
[09:14.180 --> 09:15.600]  You doing good, bro, by the way?
[09:15.600 --> 09:17.120]  I just kind of skipped right over introducing you.
[09:17.120 --> 09:18.120]  For sure.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.120]  You having a good day?
[09:19.120 --> 09:20.120]  You looked like you were working hard.
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.120]  Very, very hard.
[09:21.120 --> 09:22.120]  Take some dabs.
[09:22.120 --> 09:23.120]  Take a break.
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.120]  We'll record.
[09:24.120 --> 09:25.120]  It'll be awesome.
[09:25.480 --> 09:26.480]  So, let's talk about weed.
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.520]  You're going to need a few things.
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.080]  You should have a dehumidifier, maybe.
[09:30.080 --> 09:32.280]  You should have an air conditioner, maybe.
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.600]  You for sure need fans.
[09:33.600 --> 09:35.620]  At least one fan.
[09:35.620 --> 09:37.840]  You need what I call a hygrometer.
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.360]  That's a thermometer with a humidity reading on it, also.
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.360]  Then you're going to need some kind of jars.
[09:43.360 --> 09:44.840]  I prefer glass mason jars.
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.360]  If you're going a little bigger, there's a company, I think it's called Quick Vac.
[09:49.360 --> 09:51.120]  They're little suction vac lid jars.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.480]  They sell them at most of the head shops.
[09:52.480 --> 09:53.680]  Those are pretty chill to cure your weed in.
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.000]  A lot of people don't like them because those are plastic.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.400]  I don't think they leave any taste or smell.
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.400]  Those don't.
[09:59.400 --> 10:03.800]  If you're going bigger, I like to buy those Rubbermaid 32 quart containers.
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.800]  I think that's what it is.
[10:04.800 --> 10:05.800]  It's a big container.
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.800]  It's like a two-handed container.
[10:08.800 --> 10:10.960]  You could fit a lot of herb in one of those to cure it.
[10:10.960 --> 10:11.960]  Those work perfectly.
[10:11.960 --> 10:16.720]  So, you're going to need something to cure it in and a room to get it started to cure
[10:16.720 --> 10:17.720]  in.
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.480]  Ed Rosenthal actually taught me that curing begins at the start of harvest.
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.320]  I'm not sure how much I subscribe to Ed's teaching, but in a sense, that is accurate.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.000]  The minute you cut down that plant, you're starting the curing process.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.520]  You need that herb to dry uniformly, not too fast, not too slow.
[10:39.520 --> 10:40.760]  You don't want it in a hot room.
[10:40.760 --> 10:43.760]  You don't want it in a cool room.
[10:43.760 --> 10:47.560]  We're going to go from ... In one of our lessons before, we talked about harvest and
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.800]  drying.
[10:48.800 --> 10:52.680]  We ended drying as when where the sticks on your buds snap.
[10:52.680 --> 10:55.560]  That's pretty much where we decided we were entering cure.
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.600]  So if you've done everything right, you've got all your leaves off, your buds have dried
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.320]  evenly in a nice room that was temperature controlled, not too fast, not too cool, and
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.120]  now the sticks are snapping and the buds are a little bit damp, a little bit juicy.
[11:09.120 --> 11:12.560]  If you squeeze them, they kind of stick to your fingers, but they kind of spring back
[11:12.560 --> 11:13.560]  to life.
[11:13.560 --> 11:16.240]  You don't crush them when you squeeze them.
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.160]  You want them to have a little spring left into them.
[11:18.160 --> 11:19.160]  For sure.
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.160]  All right.
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.880]  So I guess I should really ... And don't be deceived by the crunchy layer.
[11:25.880 --> 11:30.080]  I guess it goes strain to strain, but sometimes there's a lot more leaf on the outside.
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.280]  Oh yeah.
[11:31.280 --> 11:39.720]  You know, you could get tricked either way by letting it over dry and also by thinking
[11:39.720 --> 11:41.480]  it's dry too soon.
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.480]  Right.
[11:42.480 --> 11:45.920]  So the weed dries from the outside or from the outside in.
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.240]  So even though the outside leaves are crispy and dry, the inside could be really juicy
[11:50.240 --> 11:51.240]  still.
[11:51.240 --> 11:53.520]  So you got to be careful.
[11:53.520 --> 11:56.560]  Little buds are going to dry quicker than the big buds.
[11:56.560 --> 11:57.560]  Right.
[11:57.560 --> 11:58.560]  I feel that's a ...
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.960]  I like to cut, when I grow a big bud, I actually cut that all down into the little golf ball
[12:02.960 --> 12:03.960]  sized nuggets.
[12:03.960 --> 12:07.360]  If you're one of my patients, you usually get a bag full of golf balls is what I give
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.360]  you.
[12:08.360 --> 12:11.840]  I do when I'm doing the final trim.
[12:12.360 --> 12:19.760]  When they're hanging, the bigger buds are a little harder to break down sometimes.
[12:19.760 --> 12:20.760]  Nothing to do with them?
[12:20.760 --> 12:21.760]  Yeah.
[12:21.760 --> 12:22.760]  You don't want to put them on a rack?
[12:22.760 --> 12:23.760]  Yeah.
[12:23.760 --> 12:24.760]  You don't let them hang?
[12:24.760 --> 12:25.760]  Okay.
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.760]  Well, right before we're going to cure, this is when the sticks will pop.
[12:26.760 --> 12:27.760]  So everything's all trimmed up now.
[12:27.760 --> 12:29.000]  We don't have any leaves left.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.160]  They look pretty.
[12:30.160 --> 12:32.040]  They're manicured the way you want.
[12:32.040 --> 12:35.160]  When you grab one of the buds, you pick it up and you bend the stick, it should snap.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.800]  You don't want it to bend like a straw.
[12:36.800 --> 12:38.800]  You want it to actually break, pop.
[12:38.800 --> 12:41.600]  You don't want to leave it until it explodes and breaks because then you're a little too
[12:41.640 --> 12:42.640]  dry.
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.800]  Too dry or too wet of cannabis will not cure properly.
[12:46.800 --> 12:49.880]  If you're too dry, you've already missed your point.
[12:49.880 --> 12:50.880]  You're going to get stale buds.
[12:50.880 --> 12:53.000]  You're just going to put it in the jar and waste time.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.880]  If you're too wet and you try to cure it, you're actually going to promote mold.
[12:57.880 --> 13:01.400]  So you want it about right where those sticks snap and that's when you're going to start
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.400]  the curing process.
[13:02.400 --> 13:08.240]  Let me read you what I wrote of what curing actually is and what the purpose of curing
[13:08.240 --> 13:09.240]  is.
[13:09.480 --> 13:12.040]  Just what I wrote down to give an actual reason.
[13:12.040 --> 13:18.120]  Curing is used to remove excess moisture to convert complex carbs back into sugars while
[13:18.120 --> 13:20.360]  removing chlorophyll.
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.600]  Chlorophyll is green pigment and chlorophyll makes your buds taste harsh and smell bad
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.400]  and it also makes your buds burn poorly.
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.560]  Have you guys ever smoked herb that kind of maybe tastes like you just stuck your tongue
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.180]  in a light socket and you just want to scrape your tongue off or you need a drink real bad?
[13:35.180 --> 13:37.700]  That stuff was not dried and cured properly.
[13:37.700 --> 13:41.980]  Probably not flushed properly either.
[13:41.980 --> 13:45.140]  Also as THC dries, the THC dries in your buds.
[13:45.140 --> 13:50.160]  If it dries more slowly, the more slower it loses its water moisture, the more psychoactive
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.380]  it will become.
[13:51.380 --> 13:55.460]  Once the water comes out of that THC, that's when it's ripe and nice and primed for you
[13:55.460 --> 13:56.500]  to smoke.
[13:56.500 --> 14:00.720]  So by curing it, you slowly let that happen and you don't destroy the THC, you don't destroy
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.740]  your terpenes.
[14:03.740 --> 14:08.820]  Essentially, curing allows aerobic bacteria to consume the chlorophyll in the plants.
[14:08.820 --> 14:11.860]  Chlorophyll is what we want to remove.
[14:11.860 --> 14:13.260]  Aerobic bacteria sounds like a bad thing.
[14:13.260 --> 14:15.700]  It's actually a good thing in this instance.
[14:15.700 --> 14:21.760]  Aerobic bacteria is made from air, light, and moisture being sealed inside of that jar.
[14:21.760 --> 14:28.300]  So what I do, I actually take my buds that snap, I fill my mason jar about 90% of the
[14:28.300 --> 14:29.300]  way full.
[14:29.300 --> 14:30.300]  I don't want to squish them in there.
[14:30.300 --> 14:31.740]  I just want to lightly set them in there.
[14:31.740 --> 14:34.820]  Then I seal that jar.
[14:34.820 --> 14:40.260]  As soon as that jar is sealed, the aerobic bacteria begins to form and that aerobic bacteria
[14:40.260 --> 14:44.140]  will start eating away the chlorophyll in there.
[14:44.140 --> 14:49.280]  So when you open that jar, that's when the reaction will restart.
[14:49.280 --> 14:54.500]  So what you want to do, what I do, is I put the buds in the jar, I seal it up, and then
[14:54.500 --> 14:56.420]  I wait about two hours.
[14:56.420 --> 14:58.580]  And then I go open the jar.
[14:58.660 --> 15:01.700]  And that first time I'll pour the buds out onto my little tray.
[15:01.700 --> 15:05.780]  And I want to feel the buds and make sure they haven't gotten really moist.
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.620]  If you can see sweat inside the jar, get them out of there immediately.
[15:09.620 --> 15:10.620]  You've fucked up.
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.620]  Get them out of there right away.
[15:11.620 --> 15:14.700]  So I take them out of the jar and I start squeezing them.
[15:14.700 --> 15:18.140]  And I want to feel a little bit of moisture at the edge because it's coming out of the
[15:18.140 --> 15:20.020]  middle on the surface.
[15:20.020 --> 15:23.620]  But I don't want them to be damp and sticky to where I'm afraid they're going to get mold.
[15:23.620 --> 15:25.060]  So I'll leave them out.
[15:25.060 --> 15:26.780]  This first time I dump them out and check them all out.
[15:26.780 --> 15:29.260]  I leave them sitting out for a couple minutes if I feel like they need it.
[15:29.260 --> 15:33.020]  Then I'll put them back in the jar and seal that jar up.
[15:33.020 --> 15:37.180]  If they're properly dry like I'm hoping they are at this point, I'll leave it closed for
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.340]  four hours this time.
[15:38.340 --> 15:43.500]  And I know this sounds tedious, but this is what separates the pros from the regular growers.
[15:43.500 --> 15:47.180]  This is where you get that super high-grade cured cannabis.
[15:47.180 --> 15:50.780]  That stuff you're getting at the dispensary that tastes kind of hay-like, and I don't
[15:50.780 --> 15:55.120]  mean to call out the shops, but they don't have time or space or manpower or the patience
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.740]  to cure herb.
[15:56.740 --> 16:01.320]  Your caregiver or your private grower or you are the only way you're going to get good
[16:01.320 --> 16:02.320]  cured herb.
[16:02.320 --> 16:03.320]  The dispensary is not going to do it.
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.360]  It tastes, you can taste the nutrients, you can taste the leaves, you can taste whatever
[16:07.360 --> 16:10.740]  other plant it was growing next to or hanging next to in the dry room.
[16:10.740 --> 16:13.540]  You can taste that in these dispensary buds, in my opinion.
[16:13.540 --> 16:18.380]  There are very few shops that are actually curing their herb, in my opinion.
[16:18.380 --> 16:20.180]  I don't work there, so I can't tell you what they're doing.
[16:20.180 --> 16:24.420]  I thought you were going to say there's very few shops flushing their stuff.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.420]  That too.
[16:25.420 --> 16:26.420]  That too.
[16:27.100 --> 16:29.600]  Wow, you're going to have to let me know when we ...
[16:29.600 --> 16:34.540]  That's where we'll go there and get some herbal in a day.
[16:34.540 --> 16:35.900]  You got to put your buds back in the jar.
[16:35.900 --> 16:36.900]  You seal the jar.
[16:36.900 --> 16:38.180]  You wait four hours.
[16:38.180 --> 16:40.260]  That's when I open it again.
[16:40.260 --> 16:44.420]  Then I want to check the buds and make sure that they're not getting too much moisture
[16:44.420 --> 16:45.580]  is not coming out of there.
[16:45.580 --> 16:49.940]  If I feel like it's really humid inside of the jar, I say humid.
[16:49.940 --> 16:54.540]  If it's not too humid inside of the jar, I'll put them back in there, seal it up, and let
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.820]  them sit for six hours.
[16:56.820 --> 17:01.580]  I pretty much increase the time just by a couple of hours until I get to about 12 hours.
[17:01.580 --> 17:06.980]  Once you're checking them twice a day ... I'll do six hours, and then I'll do 10 hours, and
[17:06.980 --> 17:08.540]  then I'll wait until about 12 hours.
[17:08.540 --> 17:11.940]  Then I'll usually open them every morning when I wake up, and then right before I go
[17:11.940 --> 17:12.940]  to bed.
[17:12.940 --> 17:14.780]  That's about 12 hours, usually, in my world.
[17:14.780 --> 17:16.620]  You pop open the jar, make sure it's not too moist.
[17:16.620 --> 17:18.940]  Let it sit open for just 10 or 15 minutes.
[17:18.940 --> 17:23.900]  You just want to exchange the air, and then seal it back up, and let it sit there.
[17:23.900 --> 17:28.700]  Once you've got it to a point where you know it's not going to get any mold in it, that's
[17:28.700 --> 17:30.540]  when I like to just seal it up and leave it.
[17:30.540 --> 17:32.020]  I won't open it anymore.
[17:32.020 --> 17:33.420]  Go ahead.
[17:33.420 --> 17:37.460]  It should burn really nicely at this point, correct?
[17:37.460 --> 17:41.940]  It should burn nice and smooth.
[17:41.940 --> 17:42.940]  You can tell.
[17:42.940 --> 17:45.380]  I don't know if you guys have ever had perfectly cured herb.
[17:45.380 --> 17:46.380]  It's hard to get, honestly.
[17:46.380 --> 17:47.380]  Very.
[17:47.380 --> 17:50.140]  You know that herb you can smell down the block?
[17:50.140 --> 17:51.480]  You're going, oh, man.
[17:51.480 --> 17:53.800]  That stuff was slowly dried and cured.
[17:53.800 --> 17:57.960]  It let all of the chlorophyll sneak out, and it let all of the flavor that should have
[17:57.960 --> 17:58.960]  been there.
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.920]  When the chlorophyll disappears, that's when the other colors, the reds and the purples,
[18:02.920 --> 18:05.200]  start popping up, and you can start seeing those.
[18:05.200 --> 18:07.520]  That's what gives you really pretty buds.
[18:07.520 --> 18:13.000]  That's when the THC is allowed to dry slowly, and that's when it becomes more psychoactive.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.400]  I'm not completely sure about the terpenoids, but it sounds like we need to give these terpenoids
[18:17.400 --> 18:19.680]  a little bit of time to cure, and they're also.
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.600]  If they're not getting destroyed or taken out along with the chlorophyll or with the
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.960]  moisture, if we let it go slowly, I think we're making it smell better because we're
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.640]  doing something to the terps.
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.640]  From what I know about them, they seem very fragile, too.
[18:32.640 --> 18:39.280]  This is mild to moderate temperatures and darkness, I think, are all very key to this.
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.960]  I think I read that terpenoids evaporate at approximately 85 degrees.
[18:45.960 --> 18:51.120]  We read on another episode about 106 degrees was, I think, where we said.
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.320]  I think it's right around 100 degrees, and some of your guys' drying and curing rooms
[18:55.320 --> 18:56.320]  are getting that hot.
[18:56.320 --> 18:59.320]  Excuse me, I need a sip.
[18:59.320 --> 19:03.200]  Nice, all those dabs got me all dried out and thirsty.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.240]  Dude, we took some monster dabs before the show.
[19:05.240 --> 19:08.920]  That was pretty killer.
[19:08.920 --> 19:14.200]  You need to keep opening those jars until you're confident that it's not going to mold
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.420]  up in there.
[19:15.420 --> 19:17.100]  You want a little bit of moisture.
[19:17.100 --> 19:19.060]  Kyle Cushman prefers a bud.
[19:19.060 --> 19:22.820]  He likes to open his jar and take out a couple of nugs and set them on the table.
[19:22.820 --> 19:25.900]  He would have sat here and talked for 20 minutes before he would have been able to roll them
[19:25.900 --> 19:26.900]  up.
[19:26.900 --> 19:29.580]  He would have had to give you a lecture about veganics.
[19:29.580 --> 19:33.540]  Then after that, the bud would be almost dry enough to roll up.
[19:33.540 --> 19:35.860]  Sorry, Kyle, I'm just picking on you, bro.
[19:35.860 --> 19:36.860]  You're great.
[19:36.860 --> 19:38.780]  Kyle likes his buds a little more moist.
[19:38.780 --> 19:43.220]  Our buddy Adam will take a nicely dried and cured bud that I've given him, and he'll set
[19:43.380 --> 19:46.180]  that shit out all day until it's crispy dry.
[19:46.180 --> 19:51.140]  He grinds it up in the grinder to where it's dust and takes heroic-sized bong hits out
[19:51.140 --> 19:54.980]  of it because that's what he likes to do.
[19:54.980 --> 20:00.240]  What you want to do is, I like to get it to where it's not fluffy, but it's got some squishy
[20:00.240 --> 20:01.240]  to it.
[20:01.240 --> 20:03.580]  If you've got a nice, hard, dense nug, you want to be able to give it a squeeze and it
[20:03.580 --> 20:05.140]  just pops back up.
[20:05.140 --> 20:07.260]  You don't want to crush it, and you don't want dust.
[20:07.260 --> 20:10.260]  You definitely don't want that dry, dusty buds.
[20:10.260 --> 20:13.140]  No, God no.
[20:13.180 --> 20:16.980]  How long do you try to store your cannabis?
[20:16.980 --> 20:21.580]  Some of it gets stored for up to nine months, I suppose.
[20:21.580 --> 20:24.540]  Some of the outdoor stuff.
[20:24.540 --> 20:29.340]  Some of my patients, I can give them their whole year supply at once, and they're fine
[20:29.340 --> 20:30.500]  with it.
[20:30.500 --> 20:33.980]  Some of my other patients ask me to hold onto it for them.
[20:33.980 --> 20:39.180]  Then some of them want indoor bud throughout the year.
[20:39.180 --> 20:42.580]  It's all a balance.
[20:43.020 --> 20:48.060]  The last couple of years, my stuff that's gotten nine, 10 months, I really wasn't happy
[20:48.060 --> 20:52.220]  with it by the time it was that age.
[20:52.220 --> 20:55.980]  Let's work on curing a little better, and I bet that those buds will store longer.
[20:55.980 --> 20:59.140]  I think I messed up in the beginning.
[20:59.140 --> 21:05.420]  I do pretty much what you do for the two hour, pull it out of the jar, then the four hour.
[21:05.420 --> 21:11.020]  But then it normally, it'll go 24 hours, 18 hours before I mess with it again.
[21:11.020 --> 21:12.300]  You got to set some alarms.
[21:13.020 --> 21:16.620]  I've got my iPhone full of alarms, just ridiculous beeps.
[21:16.620 --> 21:19.780]  People think I'm doing something crazy because every two hours I got to run away.
[21:19.780 --> 21:20.780]  I'll be back, dude.
[21:20.780 --> 21:24.420]  Got to go somewhere, go pop open a bunch of jars, and then go back and get them.
[21:24.420 --> 21:25.420]  For sure.
[21:25.420 --> 21:28.200]  If you're using larger batches, I guess I should have covered this.
[21:28.200 --> 21:32.580]  What I like to do is get one of those big, they're like purple Tupperware containers,
[21:32.580 --> 21:34.420]  rubber made containers.
[21:34.420 --> 21:37.440]  Fill that up with your, you can leave it on the sticks a little bit.
[21:37.440 --> 21:38.700]  If you have to, it's easier.
[21:38.700 --> 21:41.820]  I prefer it off the stick for this curing process.
[21:41.820 --> 21:46.060]  Fill those containers, and then I actually flip them upside down and take the container
[21:46.060 --> 21:48.740]  off the lid instead of taking the lid off the container.
[21:48.740 --> 21:53.460]  So you leave a more exposed area, and then just pop that container back onto the lid.
[21:53.460 --> 21:54.460]  Try not to squish any buds.
[21:54.460 --> 21:55.820]  I hope that makes sense.
[21:55.820 --> 21:58.940]  Pop it open, lift the container off, the lid's sitting there like a tray full of buds.
[21:58.940 --> 21:59.940]  For sure.
[21:59.940 --> 22:00.940]  Yeah.
[22:00.940 --> 22:01.940]  That gets a lot of air flow in there.
[22:01.940 --> 22:02.940]  Yeah.
[22:02.940 --> 22:08.980]  I like to use those, actually the same ones, or same year size, but they're like the size
[22:08.980 --> 22:09.980]  of a brownie pan.
[22:09.980 --> 22:10.980]  Yeah.
[22:11.140 --> 22:14.660]  And those work for short term storage pretty good.
[22:14.660 --> 22:15.660]  Okay.
[22:15.660 --> 22:20.860]  Now in the beginning I talked about we should have a dehumidifier, an AC unit, fans, a hygrometer.
[22:20.860 --> 22:25.420]  I'm going to back up and talk a little bit about how Ed Rosenthal says curing starts
[22:25.420 --> 22:26.420]  at harvest.
[22:26.420 --> 22:27.420]  Wait, hold on.
[22:27.420 --> 22:28.700]  I got one thing.
[22:28.700 --> 22:29.700]  Let's do it.
[22:29.700 --> 22:30.700]  I like it.
[22:30.700 --> 22:32.180]  How you pack your jar.
[22:32.180 --> 22:33.180]  Ah.
[22:33.180 --> 22:34.180]  Yeah.
[22:34.180 --> 22:36.780]  I don't like to overpack it.
[22:36.780 --> 22:45.180]  This is something I am learning, but I think there's a lot of validity to it.
[22:45.180 --> 22:51.740]  I think when you overpack it, you create possible different little microclimates in there.
[22:51.740 --> 22:56.300]  You almost prevent the aerobic acid from being able to form in there when you don't have
[22:56.300 --> 22:57.300]  enough oxygen.
[22:57.300 --> 22:58.300]  For sure.
[22:58.300 --> 23:02.820]  What creates aerobic acid, I think I said before, was oxygen, light, and moisture, and so we
[23:02.820 --> 23:06.180]  need plenty of that air in there.
[23:06.180 --> 23:07.180]  Don't worry about giving it light.
[23:07.180 --> 23:09.820]  You guys, a little bit of light will start it off, and once you get it started, it's
[23:09.820 --> 23:10.820]  going.
[23:10.820 --> 23:11.820]  I'm fixing the echoes in here.
[23:11.820 --> 23:15.540]  We are in a really small space that's real echoey today.
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.740]  There's a fan that we're fighting with, but I'm going to make it happen.
[23:17.740 --> 23:19.500]  I think I got it just there.
[23:19.500 --> 23:20.500]  Sweet.
[23:20.500 --> 23:21.500]  All right.
[23:21.500 --> 23:26.900]  So like I said, Ed Rosenthal says that curing starts from pretty much when you cut it down.
[23:26.900 --> 23:30.420]  So if your buds have gotten too dry, they're not going to cure.
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.420]  They're going to crumble.
[23:31.420 --> 23:35.260]  If your buds are too moist, you still have a chance, but hopefully they didn't dry too
[23:35.260 --> 23:36.260]  quickly.
[23:36.260 --> 23:41.100]  You got to cut down the plant and get all those leaves off and let it dry nice and slowly.
[23:41.100 --> 23:44.620]  That's why we're talking about a room with a dehumidifier, with an air conditioner, and
[23:44.620 --> 23:46.620]  some fans and a hygrometer.
[23:46.620 --> 23:53.660]  You want to keep your plants between 60 and 75 degrees at about 50% humidity until you
[23:53.660 --> 23:58.820]  put them in this jar, until they reach that stick snap in period.
[23:58.820 --> 24:00.820]  That's how you keep them from not drying too fast.
[24:01.220 --> 24:06.060]  I had a guy that a long time ago, I used to have to buy some herb, and this guy usually
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.460]  had the greatest bud.
[24:07.460 --> 24:10.340]  A long time ago.
[24:10.340 --> 24:11.340]  And I was bugging him.
[24:11.340 --> 24:12.700]  I was like, dude, you got any more of that LA Confidential?
[24:12.700 --> 24:14.460]  Do you have any more of that LA Confidential?
[24:14.460 --> 24:15.460]  And he didn't.
[24:15.460 --> 24:16.900]  And he kept telling me, I harvested it.
[24:16.900 --> 24:17.900]  It's almost ready.
[24:17.900 --> 24:18.900]  I harvested it.
[24:18.900 --> 24:19.900]  It's almost ready.
[24:19.900 --> 24:20.900]  And I was getting eager.
[24:20.900 --> 24:23.100]  And so I asked him and he's like, sure, man, I'll bring it to you tonight.
[24:23.100 --> 24:27.420]  And he brought it to me and it was a really weird texture.
[24:27.420 --> 24:29.700]  It felt like a pine cone.
[24:29.700 --> 24:31.620]  It was hard, but it was also squeezy.
[24:31.620 --> 24:33.220]  But the outside was really hard.
[24:33.220 --> 24:36.380]  And then you broke it open and the middle was soft and it was kind of fluffy on the
[24:36.380 --> 24:37.380]  inside.
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.380]  So I immediately called him.
[24:38.380 --> 24:40.180]  I was like, what the hell happened, bro?
[24:40.180 --> 24:44.940]  And he said that he dried it by opening the oven and setting it next to the oven so that
[24:44.940 --> 24:46.580]  it would dry it out all night.
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.580]  Oh, shit.
[24:47.580 --> 24:48.580]  Yeah.
[24:48.580 --> 24:51.460]  So that is a prime example of what not to do to dry your herb.
[24:51.460 --> 24:53.260]  I could taste it and smell it.
[24:53.260 --> 24:55.580]  I made the weed smell like spaghetti sauce.
[24:55.580 --> 24:58.060]  Like it smelled like marinara for some reason.
[24:58.420 --> 24:59.780]  That was the first thing that came to mind.
[24:59.780 --> 25:01.580]  Yeah, it's going to kill all the turps.
[25:01.580 --> 25:02.580]  Yeah.
[25:02.580 --> 25:03.580]  Yeah.
[25:03.580 --> 25:04.820]  You know, some sort of tomatoey paste or something.
[25:04.820 --> 25:05.820]  It was terrible.
[25:05.820 --> 25:06.820]  That sucks.
[25:06.820 --> 25:09.940]  So you got to get that herb dried properly and slowly.
[25:09.940 --> 25:11.460]  You don't want to dry it up too fast.
[25:11.460 --> 25:13.500]  You got anything to add to curing, bro?
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.820]  I feel like we went over that really super quickly.
[25:15.820 --> 25:16.820]  Yeah.
[25:16.820 --> 25:17.820]  I'm just really stoned.
[25:17.820 --> 25:18.820]  It's me too.
[25:18.820 --> 25:19.820]  Me too.
[25:19.820 --> 25:22.700]  It's hard to project a lot of my thoughts.
[25:22.700 --> 25:25.740]  Do you need crayons?
[25:25.740 --> 25:32.060]  So the dehumidifier, the AC unit, the fans, the hygrometer, you need that regardless of
[25:32.060 --> 25:33.060]  where you're at.
[25:33.060 --> 25:36.100]  Yeah, you got to keep, you need a proper room for drying.
[25:36.100 --> 25:38.460]  A lot of guys are just throwing it in their closet or something.
[25:38.460 --> 25:40.380]  You need a good area for drying.
[25:40.380 --> 25:42.700]  You want to keep the air moving.
[25:42.700 --> 25:47.140]  The reason for the dehumidifier, what we're trying to do is we are pulling water out of
[25:47.140 --> 25:48.140]  these plants.
[25:48.140 --> 25:50.900]  That water ends up in the atmosphere around your plants and then it has nowhere to go.
[25:50.900 --> 25:53.020]  So you got to suck that water out of there.
[25:53.020 --> 25:57.460]  The dehumidifier is a perfect place for that water to go and you can reuse that water to
[25:57.460 --> 25:58.460]  water your plants later.
[25:58.460 --> 26:00.460]  Oh yeah, that's some good water.
[26:00.460 --> 26:01.460]  Yeah.
[26:01.460 --> 26:12.380]  However, I do know if say you're drying not a lot of plants in a large room in the Southwest,
[26:12.380 --> 26:15.860]  you might actually want a humidifier to help slow things down.
[26:15.860 --> 26:16.860]  Right.
[26:16.860 --> 26:18.740]  I'm trying to kind of help out people regionally.
[26:18.740 --> 26:20.420]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[26:20.420 --> 26:25.220]  We're kind of talking about Colorado, but yeah, as long as you need to keep it about
[26:25.220 --> 26:30.940]  60 to 75 degrees that cool, actually I think will make your buds dry a little more dense.
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.460]  I think it hardens them up a little bit.
[26:33.460 --> 26:34.820]  Also I got to mention dark.
[26:34.820 --> 26:36.700]  You want that dry room dark.
[26:36.700 --> 26:39.420]  Drying and curing should happen in mostly a dark area.
[26:39.420 --> 26:46.100]  I feel like literally a room, exact two same climates, one that's dark and one that's light.
[26:46.100 --> 26:50.060]  The room with lights, the plants are going to dry faster.
[26:50.700 --> 26:55.980]  Yeah, just kind of experience I have with my dry room and keeping a window open sometimes
[26:55.980 --> 27:01.260]  and I know nothing else changed.
[27:01.260 --> 27:04.020]  So guys, it is going to take a little bit of practice to get your drying and curing
[27:04.020 --> 27:05.620]  method down right.
[27:05.620 --> 27:08.420]  You may have to ruin a jar or two.
[27:08.420 --> 27:12.620]  Seal that jar up, go to sleep, open it the next day and you open it and it smells like
[27:12.620 --> 27:13.620]  ammonia.
[27:13.620 --> 27:15.300]  You might've just kind of killed that crop.
[27:15.300 --> 27:18.900]  If it's not moldy, if you don't see any mold, break it open as small as you can get those
[27:18.940 --> 27:22.100]  buds, pour it out on a tray, let it dry.
[27:22.100 --> 27:23.860]  Taste it, give it a smoke, see if it tastes alright.
[27:23.860 --> 27:25.700]  It might be alright, it might be smokeable.
[27:25.700 --> 27:29.020]  If you left it in there too long and it molded up, throw it away.
[27:29.020 --> 27:31.100]  Remember what you did, fix it next time.
[27:31.100 --> 27:32.500]  Don't do that same shit again.
[27:32.500 --> 27:35.060]  Yeah, always start with clean jars.
[27:35.060 --> 27:36.060]  Clean jars, yeah.
[27:36.060 --> 27:41.740]  I spent a lot of time today cleaning jars and thinking, man, this really sucks.
[27:41.740 --> 27:47.100]  This isn't, you know, but it's, you know, every little thing counts.
[27:47.100 --> 27:50.540]  Has anybody tried to cut off their feet and stick cloning gel on their ankles so that
[27:50.540 --> 27:51.540]  we can clone ourselves?
[27:51.540 --> 27:54.200]  Because we need to make more growers.
[27:54.200 --> 27:56.220]  It's hard to be a good grower sometimes.
[27:56.220 --> 28:01.100]  There is so much, like you got to do the growing work, you got to do life and then you got
[28:01.100 --> 28:04.500]  to clean up after yourself and that's always the part that gets skipped and then you got
[28:04.500 --> 28:05.900]  to go start by cleaning tomorrow.
[28:05.900 --> 28:09.900]  You guys keep your grow rooms clean because it builds up quickly and then you got to clone
[28:09.900 --> 28:12.220]  yourself because you just can't keep everything going.
[28:12.220 --> 28:14.500]  I could, two of me would crush.
[28:14.500 --> 28:16.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:16.420 --> 28:22.060]  If you have a lot of money and you have no shame and you want to clean pots and scrub
[28:22.060 --> 28:27.020]  floors and all that and come to Colorado and learn how to grow weed, get in contact with
[28:27.020 --> 28:28.020]  us.
[28:28.020 --> 28:31.820]  Did you just make, did you just offer an apprenticeship almost?
[28:31.820 --> 28:34.020]  Yeah, but they got to pay to start the company.
[28:34.020 --> 28:38.060]  They're going to pay to start it and then they're going to be the employee that carries
[28:38.060 --> 28:41.100]  buckets and sweeps floors and mops up the shit for us.
[28:41.100 --> 28:42.100]  Yep.
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.580]  And someday they'll be the bombest dispensary owner there is.
[28:44.740 --> 28:45.740]  Yeah, we'll teach them how to grow.
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.740]  Definitely.
[28:46.740 --> 28:50.420]  I need to pass on these skills to people because one day I'm going to be not here.
[28:50.420 --> 28:54.660]  I was going to say get hit by a truck or something, but I didn't want to jinx myself.
[28:54.660 --> 28:57.020]  One day I'm going to get hit by a bus, you know, and I'm not going to be able to grow
[28:57.020 --> 28:58.020]  weed anymore.
[28:58.020 --> 29:00.180]  A bus just flies through the house.
[29:00.180 --> 29:04.260]  Isn't that a line in a sublime song or something like that?
[29:04.260 --> 29:05.940]  I don't know.
[29:05.940 --> 29:08.060]  Yeah, something bulletproof vest.
[29:08.060 --> 29:09.060]  Oh, okay.
[29:09.060 --> 29:10.060]  Ran over by a truck.
[29:10.060 --> 29:11.060]  Yeah.
[29:11.060 --> 29:12.060]  Yeah.
[29:12.060 --> 29:13.060]  I can't remember off the top of my head.
[29:13.060 --> 29:14.780]  I can't remember most things off the top of your head.
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.220]  Well, yeah, but I'm the second biggest blind fan in the world.
[29:18.220 --> 29:19.220]  The second, the second.
[29:19.220 --> 29:21.500]  You just try to take number one.
[29:21.500 --> 29:22.500]  Yeah.
[29:22.500 --> 29:23.500]  Yeah.
[29:23.500 --> 29:24.500]  Never do.
[29:24.500 --> 29:26.620]  All right, guys, I feel like we've covered curing.
[29:26.620 --> 29:28.940]  I don't know what else to add to this.
[29:28.940 --> 29:29.940]  You're going to mess up some stuff.
[29:29.940 --> 29:30.940]  That's where I was.
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.320]  It takes practice and patience.
[29:32.320 --> 29:34.140]  You're not going to get it right the first time.
[29:34.140 --> 29:35.140]  Yeah.
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.580]  What you can do is go.
[29:38.580 --> 29:41.220]  You can open it too often.
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.740]  That's a good thing.
[29:43.420 --> 29:44.420]  If you're keeping it closed too long, it'll screw you up.
[29:44.420 --> 29:45.580]  So go in there and open it.
[29:45.580 --> 29:48.340]  If you think maybe I need to open it, do.
[29:48.340 --> 29:51.460]  And then if you have another jar next to it, don't open that one and just kind of compare.
[29:51.460 --> 29:52.580]  Take notes.
[29:52.580 --> 29:56.700]  That's the best way to become a good grower and a good cure and dryer is to practice it
[29:56.700 --> 29:58.300]  and take notes.
[29:58.300 --> 30:02.620]  What's your thoughts on rehydrating dry weed?
[30:02.620 --> 30:09.780]  You know, I'm not sponsored by this company, but the Humidipax work great for rehydrating
[30:09.780 --> 30:10.780]  your buds.
[30:10.780 --> 30:15.180]  I've been wondering what they'd be like for long term storage as well.
[30:15.180 --> 30:19.540]  I've seen a lot of people throw their herb in a sea vault, which doesn't sponsor me either,
[30:19.540 --> 30:24.140]  with a couple of Humidipax and leave it for a really long time.
[30:24.140 --> 30:26.780]  Back to the dried out herb.
[30:26.780 --> 30:29.940]  Don't put lettuce or orange peels in your bags, please.
[30:29.940 --> 30:31.180]  That's kind of what I was getting at.
[30:31.180 --> 30:32.180]  I see.
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.180]  Yeah.
[30:33.180 --> 30:34.180]  Yeah.
[30:34.180 --> 30:35.180]  That'll make mold.
[30:35.180 --> 30:36.180]  Yeah.
[30:36.180 --> 30:37.180]  That'll make your stuff not taste right.
[30:37.180 --> 30:38.180]  It doesn't add flavor.
[30:38.180 --> 30:40.180]  It may will, but not the flavor you want added.
[30:40.580 --> 30:41.580]  Yeah.
[30:41.580 --> 30:42.580]  Yeah.
[30:42.580 --> 30:43.580]  It'll be funky flavor.
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.580]  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
[30:44.580 --> 30:47.780]  What else was I...
[30:47.780 --> 30:54.620]  Curing a herb that you've possibly purchased from someone, you know, just trying to help
[30:54.620 --> 30:56.100]  out listeners here.
[30:56.100 --> 30:57.100]  There you go.
[30:57.100 --> 30:58.100]  Ask them.
[30:58.100 --> 31:03.060]  So if you've got an herb that you don't feel is dry enough, if you've got some patience,
[31:03.060 --> 31:04.260]  you can cure it.
[31:04.260 --> 31:08.660]  If it's sticky, you can leave it in the jar and let it kind of dry real slowly in the
[31:08.660 --> 31:09.660]  jar.
[31:09.660 --> 31:12.340]  Leave it in there overnight, open it up, check on it in the morning and leave it open for
[31:12.340 --> 31:17.060]  like 15 minutes and just repeat that every day until it's good or open it every six hours
[31:17.060 --> 31:19.100]  and check on it if you're impatient.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.100]  Yeah.
[31:20.100 --> 31:21.100]  Yeah.
[31:21.100 --> 31:22.380]  Brown paper sack possibly.
[31:22.380 --> 31:24.860]  Brown paper sacks are great because they kind of...
[31:24.860 --> 31:26.220]  I did this when I was just starting.
[31:26.220 --> 31:30.060]  I kind of think that they kind of make a little bit of a flavor in my buds now.
[31:30.060 --> 31:31.060]  I do too.
[31:31.060 --> 31:35.900]  And I've also lost a nice amount of weed, a whole brown paper sandwich bag to mold.
[31:35.900 --> 31:38.340]  I feel like it sped up the mold process.
[31:39.020 --> 31:41.820]  I kind of feel like they may absorb oils as well too.
[31:41.820 --> 31:42.820]  Very true.
[31:42.820 --> 31:49.500]  But if you can time it right, it's a great step between the hanging process and the jar.
[31:49.500 --> 31:51.500]  It's that one, if you have to leave it out for...
[31:51.500 --> 31:54.860]  If you've got to be away at work all day, but you know it should be in the jar, but
[31:54.860 --> 31:58.660]  it's not dry enough for the jar, that bag is probably going to work for you.
[31:58.660 --> 32:02.580]  There's a company ideal for someone.
[32:02.580 --> 32:06.220]  Come up with a brown paper sack that doesn't have all those issues we just mentioned.
[32:06.220 --> 32:07.900]  It's a canvas bag.
[32:08.460 --> 32:13.780]  Those old vitamin cottage shopping bags, I've cured urban those before.
[32:13.780 --> 32:14.780]  Really?
[32:14.780 --> 32:15.780]  That's been great.
[32:15.780 --> 32:17.700]  I've seen it done in a five gallon bucket as well.
[32:17.700 --> 32:18.700]  Oh yeah.
[32:18.700 --> 32:20.660]  I've done and seen that too.
[32:20.660 --> 32:22.300]  I just prefer the glass.
[32:22.300 --> 32:24.860]  I feel like it doesn't give me any flavor.
[32:24.860 --> 32:25.860]  For sure.
[32:25.860 --> 32:32.300]  If you're doing five gallon buckets, try to find the good lids that have the rubber seals
[32:32.300 --> 32:37.620]  in them and black buckets from the grocery store or Sherwin-Williams.
[32:37.620 --> 32:41.140]  If your weed came in a turkey bag, it was not dried and cured properly.
[32:41.140 --> 32:42.140]  No.
[32:42.140 --> 32:46.820]  It was possibly dried and stacked in a corner.
[32:46.820 --> 32:47.860]  Yes.
[32:47.860 --> 32:49.700]  With all of the others.
[32:49.700 --> 32:54.860]  Before it got shipped off to wherever it's in Colorado Springs.
[32:54.860 --> 32:56.860]  So I mentioned this at the beginning of the episode.
[32:56.860 --> 33:00.420]  Guys, I'm going to say that we've covered the dry and curing for the most part.
[33:00.420 --> 33:04.740]  If you have any more questions, specific questions, please send me those questions.
[33:04.740 --> 33:06.860]  There's a listener that this episode was for.
[33:06.860 --> 33:09.620]  I don't know if she wants her name said on the air, but she just recently emailed me
[33:09.620 --> 33:11.940]  saying she was excited because I told her it was coming.
[33:11.940 --> 33:13.260]  She said she was excited.
[33:13.260 --> 33:16.500]  If I missed anything for you, please let me know.
[33:16.500 --> 33:17.500]  Anybody else let me know also.
[33:17.500 --> 33:19.420]  I want to make this work for you.
[33:19.420 --> 33:22.220]  Everybody needs to be a good dryer and cure.
[33:22.220 --> 33:24.020]  I know I skipped a whole bunch of grow lessons.
[33:24.020 --> 33:26.340]  We were doing grow lessons on the show.
[33:26.340 --> 33:27.620]  We got all the way through veg.
[33:27.620 --> 33:31.940]  We're in mid veg phase just before we were going to flower and we've jumped all over
[33:31.940 --> 33:32.940]  the place.
[33:32.940 --> 33:33.940]  We've harvested.
[33:33.940 --> 33:34.940]  We've done outdoor grow.
[33:34.940 --> 33:35.940]  We're now curing.
[33:36.020 --> 33:37.020]  We'll get back to the lessons.
[33:37.020 --> 33:39.540]  I've just been trying to do what's current and what's relevant.
[33:39.540 --> 33:42.260]  I'm not trying to mess you up, throw you around.
[33:42.260 --> 33:44.580]  We'll get back to the lessons.
[33:44.580 --> 33:49.200]  At the beginning of the show, I mentioned that the city council meeting has been moved.
[33:49.200 --> 33:51.060]  City council first planned the meeting for Monday.
[33:51.060 --> 33:52.220]  They knew it was a holiday.
[33:52.220 --> 33:55.780]  They still wanted to meet, but they changed their mind.
[33:55.780 --> 34:00.980]  The meeting will now be Tuesday at seven o'clock at city hall at one city hall plaza.
[34:00.980 --> 34:01.980]  I wrote it down.
[34:01.980 --> 34:02.980]  I said at the beginning of the show.
[34:02.980 --> 34:03.980]  It's on my phone.
[34:03.980 --> 34:04.980]  I better make sure, but go there.
[34:04.980 --> 34:05.980]  Jesse, are you going to be there, bro?
[34:05.980 --> 34:06.980]  Oh, you know, I will be there.
[34:06.980 --> 34:07.980]  I'm committing right now.
[34:07.980 --> 34:08.980]  I got a little posse coming with me.
[34:08.980 --> 34:09.980]  You got a posse.
[34:09.980 --> 34:10.980]  Nice.
[34:10.980 --> 34:11.980]  Yeah.
[34:11.980 --> 34:12.980]  Tuesdays are actually much better for me.
[34:12.980 --> 34:13.980]  Tuesday was kind of hard or Monday was kind of hard.
[34:13.980 --> 34:14.980]  So Tuesday is way better.
[34:14.980 --> 34:15.980]  So it's one city hall place Tuesday at 7pm.
[34:15.980 --> 34:16.980]  If you want to speak, you have to be there about 630 and sign up, please.
[34:16.980 --> 34:17.980]  If you're going to speak, I'm trying to have some education.
[34:17.980 --> 34:18.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:18.980 --> 34:19.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:19.980 --> 34:20.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:20.980 --> 34:21.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:21.980 --> 34:22.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:22.980 --> 34:23.980]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:54.040 --> 34:55.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:55.040 --> 34:56.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:56.040 --> 34:57.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:57.040 --> 34:58.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:58.040 --> 34:59.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[34:59.040 --> 35:00.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:00.040 --> 35:01.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:01.040 --> 35:02.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:02.040 --> 35:03.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:03.040 --> 35:04.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:04.040 --> 35:05.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:05.040 --> 35:06.040]  I'm trying to get some experience.
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.040]  I've seen people yell at city council before trying to prove a point and that doesn't help.
[35:07.040 --> 35:08.040]  And slowly but surely it fakes out as well.
[35:08.040 --> 35:09.040]  Just kind of, I don't know, I have some experience.
[35:09.040 --> 35:10.040]  I know.
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.920]  Deny the thing what they're looking for hasn't even been submitted to or what they're talking about hasn't been shown to them yet
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.120]  We're gonna preempt this so they'll be like oh shit, then maybe we shouldn't do that
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.160]  Yeah, they don't want to mess with all 60 of us sitting there at the City Council meeting telling them why it sucks
[35:25.160 --> 35:26.920]  They'll just go okay. You're right
[35:26.920 --> 35:28.920]  They're pretty easy sometimes sometimes
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.240]  Especially on a Tuesday after a holiday no one's gonna be in the mood to sit there
[35:34.200 --> 35:35.200]  I
[35:35.200 --> 35:36.600]  Hope this was a holiday
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.120]  So you guys come out please come out and support us at the City Council if you're in Pueblo, Colorado

[36:20.160 --> 36:22.160]  Sometimes it's awkward
[36:22.400 --> 36:24.520]  Sometimes I'm just too damn high for my own good
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.920]  All right guys. I really appreciate to him too. I can't even say appreciate I

[36:48.960 --> 36:53.340]  They'll be like you missed this part, bro. This episode will actually be posted in like three hours

[36:58.840 --> 37:03.120]  Pretty close my friend that's listening late at night. I hope you're doing well
[37:03.760 --> 37:06.400]  All right, we're gonna wrap up this part. You got any shout outs or anything
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.120]  What's up, baby

[37:36.080 --> 37:40.520]  Don't forget about the new coupon code at nature's green remedies
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.880]  Your purchase at nature's green remedies helps keep homeless people in the Detroit area warm. It's getting cold as shit up there
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.960]  Also, don't forget. I need somebody to go and count how many times I said the f-word
[37:51.960 --> 37:55.160]  I don't think I said it at all in this episode, so we're making progress
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.000]  Fuck yeah, see we talked about it earlier the guests can say whatever they want cuz I like you to be yourself
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.880]  But I gotta be a good host and be a good little boy. What was that coupon code again?
[38:03.880 --> 38:08.200]  Oh, yeah, I never said that did I it's coupon code helping hands nice

[38:44.120 --> 38:46.200]  End it, but there's no reason to take a break because we're on a roll
