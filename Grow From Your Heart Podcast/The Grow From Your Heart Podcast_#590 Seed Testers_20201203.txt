[00:00.000 --> 00:20.850]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 590 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:20.850 --> 00:24.850]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about what I expect from testers when I send them test seeds.
[00:24.850 --> 00:30.850]  But before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show on Patreon.

[01:14.850 --> 01:17.850]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so,
[01:17.850 --> 01:23.850]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:23.850 --> 01:25.850]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:25.850 --> 01:31.850]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:31.850 --> 01:36.850]  All right. I said I was going to talk about tester expectations, what I expect from testers.
[01:36.850 --> 01:38.850]  I'm not going to waste a lot of time here at the start of the show.
[01:38.850 --> 01:41.850]  Let's jump right into this episode.
[01:41.850 --> 01:43.850]  Tester expectations. What do I mean by that?
[01:43.850 --> 01:45.850]  As a breeder, maybe you're not familiar.
[01:45.850 --> 01:48.850]  I am, of course, the head proprietor, the breeder, the founder.
[01:48.850 --> 01:52.850]  I'm the only dude, the only person of Iree Genetics Premium Seeds.
[01:52.850 --> 01:55.850]  We make premium regular and feminized seeds.
[01:55.850 --> 01:58.850]  That is what I do also outside of the podcast.
[01:58.850 --> 02:00.850]  So check out Iree Genetics. Of course, most of you know that.
[02:00.850 --> 02:04.850]  But visit the website, ireegenetics.com for all the details there.
[02:04.850 --> 02:05.850]  Testers. What am I talking about?
[02:05.850 --> 02:15.850]  Testers as a breeder, I breed new creations and I need help testing those to make sure they qualify for the market before we put them out for everybody to play with.
[02:15.850 --> 02:17.850]  So I create a bunch of new things.
[02:17.850 --> 02:19.850]  I put my male plant in the room.
[02:19.850 --> 02:23.850]  I let him pollinate a bunch of familiar females so I can replenish my stock for the market.
[02:23.850 --> 02:26.850]  While I'm at it, I'll throw in a couple of new females in there.
[02:26.850 --> 02:28.850]  Then I don't know what those females are going to make.
[02:28.850 --> 02:33.850]  So I'll grow a few of them out myself to make sure they're good quality, make sure they pass my standards.
[02:33.850 --> 02:36.850]  But as the breeder, they better pass my standards.
[02:36.850 --> 02:38.850]  Right. I know what the mom plant was.
[02:38.850 --> 02:39.850]  I know what the dad plant was.
[02:39.850 --> 02:41.850]  I know all the ingredients to the pie.
[02:41.850 --> 02:43.850]  I should know how to bake the pie perfectly at that point.
[02:43.850 --> 02:45.850]  They better come out good for me.
[02:45.850 --> 02:46.850]  Sometimes they don't.
[02:46.850 --> 02:47.850]  I throw all those away.
[02:47.850 --> 02:54.850]  If they don't pass my germination expectations, if they don't grow well for me, if it doesn't reach my overall goal, I will throw the seeds away.
[02:54.850 --> 03:01.850]  If they do reach my expectations, reach my goal, my next step is to send them out to testers so that other growers can grow them.
[03:01.850 --> 03:05.850]  I'm going to talk about what I expect from the testers, who the testers are.
[03:05.850 --> 03:06.850]  We're going to talk a lot about that.
[03:06.850 --> 03:08.850]  So let's just get right into it.
[03:08.850 --> 03:09.850]  Tester expectations.
[03:09.850 --> 03:11.850]  How do I choose testers?
[03:11.850 --> 03:12.850]  That's what people ask me the most.
[03:12.850 --> 03:13.850]  How can I be a tester?
[03:13.850 --> 03:15.850]  How do you choose the testers?
[03:15.850 --> 03:16.850]  Testers are chosen.
[03:16.850 --> 03:20.850]  I've got a lot of notes here, so excuse me if I don't stare into the camera a lot this time.
[03:20.850 --> 03:21.850]  I've got a lot of notes.
[03:21.850 --> 03:23.850]  We're going to try to stay a little bit focused today.
[03:23.850 --> 03:25.850]  Tester expectations.
[03:25.850 --> 03:31.850]  Testers are chosen from social media, forums, and from mainly my gang of misfit friends.
[03:31.850 --> 03:34.850]  I've got a little group of friends that I hang out with, I grow with.
[03:34.850 --> 03:36.850]  They get first dibs at the seeds.
[03:36.850 --> 03:39.850]  If you're local and I can go see your grow, I can take pictures of your grow myself.
[03:39.850 --> 03:42.850]  I really prefer that you get the seeds first.
[03:42.850 --> 03:45.850]  So my local group of misfit grower friends get the seeds first.
[03:45.850 --> 03:48.850]  Then the social media people will get seeds after that.
[03:48.850 --> 03:53.850]  Instagram, CannaBuzz, some of the forums, definitely my Patreon supporters,
[03:53.850 --> 03:55.850]  definitely getting moved up when it's time for testers.
[03:55.850 --> 03:58.850]  I think of them because they're serious about it.
[03:58.850 --> 03:59.850]  They're contributing.
[03:59.850 --> 04:02.850]  They're listening to the show, so I know they're going to do it correctly,
[04:02.850 --> 04:04.850]  especially after this episode.
[04:04.850 --> 04:05.850]  They're serious about it.
[04:05.850 --> 04:06.850]  That's the bottom line.
[04:06.850 --> 04:09.850]  They're doing it correctly because they're serious, and they're doing the Rasta Jeff method,
[04:09.850 --> 04:12.850]  so I trust they're going to grow these seeds in a great way, and it's going to be reliable.
[04:13.850 --> 04:17.850]  So the testers come from social media, forums, and my friends.
[04:17.850 --> 04:22.850]  I choose testers for a few different reasons and with a few different criteria in mind.
[04:22.850 --> 04:25.850]  I don't need the same thing from every tester.
[04:25.850 --> 04:28.850]  That's why I choose different testers.
[04:28.850 --> 04:30.850]  The first goal of outside testing is to see what I've created.
[04:30.850 --> 04:32.850]  I've talked about that.
[04:32.850 --> 04:34.850]  I know what to expect in my grow because I know the parents.
[04:34.850 --> 04:35.850]  I've talked about that.
[04:35.850 --> 04:36.850]  Where are we in these notes?
[04:36.850 --> 04:37.850]  I skipped some stuff.
[04:37.850 --> 04:41.850]  Oh, so when I'm sending these out, I need growers of different skill sets,
[04:41.850 --> 04:46.850]  growing in different varieties of rooms, different types of nutrients, different mediums, different lighting.
[04:46.850 --> 04:49.850]  That's the word that wouldn't come into my head, and I'm looking right into these bright lights.
[04:49.850 --> 04:54.850]  I need people growing under LED lights, HPS lights, CMH lights, all the different kind of stuff.
[04:54.850 --> 04:56.850]  I want to see what my new plants do under there.
[04:56.850 --> 05:01.850]  So my goal is to see how these plants react in your environment, in different growers' environments.
[05:01.850 --> 05:03.850]  I expect some of you guys to abuse them.
[05:03.850 --> 05:06.850]  I expect some of you guys to treat them beautifully.
[05:06.850 --> 05:08.850]  I expect some of the rooms to not be perfect.
[05:08.850 --> 05:11.850]  I hope somebody gets spider mites in the middle of the grow.
[05:11.850 --> 05:12.850]  I'm not hoping you do.
[05:12.850 --> 05:15.850]  I hope somebody else gets spider mites in the middle of the grow while they're testing my seeds.
[05:15.850 --> 05:18.850]  That way we can find out how these plants react to spider mites.
[05:18.850 --> 05:20.850]  Are they mite resistant?
[05:20.850 --> 05:22.850]  Are they going to get invaded with mites?
[05:22.850 --> 05:26.850]  If you've got four different plants in the room, does one specific strain get attracted to the mites?
[05:26.850 --> 05:27.850]  Do the mites love that one?
[05:27.850 --> 05:29.850]  That's the kind of shit that I want to see.
[05:29.850 --> 05:32.850]  Then when you're growing them, I want to see if you see any issues.
[05:32.850 --> 05:34.850]  Are the plants just sloppy and shitty?
[05:34.850 --> 05:37.850]  Did we make a bunch of problematic plants?
[05:37.850 --> 05:38.850]  Are there any intersex traits?
[05:38.850 --> 05:41.850]  That's one of the things we are really looking for, intersex traits.
[05:41.850 --> 05:45.850]  If the plants throw nanners, if they're intersex at all, I want to get rid of those.
[05:45.850 --> 05:48.850]  In my opinion, those aren't good to give out as a breeder.
[05:48.850 --> 05:52.850]  I'm going to not pass that seed line on if we get a bunch of intersex plants.
[05:52.850 --> 05:53.850]  Did I make a bunch of mutants?
[05:53.850 --> 05:55.850]  That's always an option.
[05:55.850 --> 05:58.850]  When you're playing with genetics, two plants that come from different parts of the world,
[05:58.850 --> 06:03.850]  or nowadays, two fucking polyhybrid plants that have just been bred from things that have been bred from other things
[06:03.850 --> 06:05.850]  that not a lot of thought may have been put into.
[06:05.850 --> 06:08.850]  I got a hold of them now, and I like the plant, so I'm breeding with it.
[06:08.850 --> 06:12.850]  I've got the opportunity to make a bunch of shitty mutants, and I have.
[06:12.850 --> 06:16.850]  I've thrown those seeds away, but we've got to test them and find out if we grow mutants.
[06:16.850 --> 06:18.850]  Maybe under my lights, they grew beautifully.
[06:18.850 --> 06:20.850]  Maybe under your light, they express some weird shit.
[06:20.850 --> 06:23.850]  That phenotypical expression may be different in your environment.
[06:23.850 --> 06:28.850]  My main goal is to make winners that outperform both parents.
[06:28.850 --> 06:32.850]  I've got a female plant, and I say, ooh, there's traits to that female that I really like,
[06:32.850 --> 06:34.850]  and I've got a couple of males to choose from.
[06:34.850 --> 06:37.850]  I also can reverse things, so I can see a lot of different opportunities.
[06:37.850 --> 06:40.850]  My goal is to make something better than both parents.
[06:40.850 --> 06:45.850]  If I don't make something better than both parents, I don't feel like I should pass it on to you.
[06:45.850 --> 06:51.850]  There's already a bunch of level eights, so I take two level eights, and I try to make a level 10 or an 11 or 12.
[06:51.850 --> 06:54.850]  If I don't come out with at least a solid 9.5, I don't pass it on.
[06:54.850 --> 07:00.850]  We don't even play with it, so I feel like everything that I do put out is a solid 9.5, at least a 10.
[07:00.850 --> 07:01.850]  I'm aiming for 11s.
[07:01.850 --> 07:04.850]  Everybody wants those 12s, but let's be realistic.
[07:04.850 --> 07:09.850]  I'm looking for shit that outperforms the parents, and I'm hoping that I see that in your garden, not just in mine.
[07:09.850 --> 07:13.850]  Like I said before, in my garden, it's really easy to see what these plants are going to do.
[07:13.850 --> 07:14.850]  I can predict it.
[07:14.850 --> 07:20.850]  I know that when I put red and blue together, I should get purple, and if I add a little bit more red, I'm going to get more reddish purple.
[07:20.850 --> 07:23.850]  I don't know the tone that that's going to be, but you know what I'm saying.
[07:23.850 --> 07:24.850]  It's like being a chef.
[07:24.850 --> 07:28.850]  If I know I've worked with these ingredients so many times, I know how to put them together and make it work,
[07:28.850 --> 07:30.850]  so I should know how to run these plants.
[07:30.850 --> 07:32.850]  Let me keep going with testing.
[07:32.850 --> 07:37.850]  So what I expect from you, what I'm asking from you is to let me know what these plants are doing.
[07:37.850 --> 07:41.850]  How do they work in your environment, in your growth style, in your media?
[07:41.850 --> 07:46.850]  In exchange, you get super cool, new, free seeds.
[07:46.850 --> 07:47.850]  Not a lot of people get testers.
[07:47.850 --> 07:53.850]  I mean, plenty of people get them, but if you think about the overall seed market, not a lot of people get these testers right away.
[07:53.850 --> 07:55.850]  You've got the first drop of brand-new shit.
[07:55.850 --> 07:57.850]  Nobody else around you is going to have it.
[07:57.850 --> 08:01.850]  Hopefully only one or two people in your neighborhood got these, one or two people in your group.
[08:01.850 --> 08:07.850]  I encourage people to show off my testers, too, so that gives you a whole new, some Instagram clout, some shit to show off.
[08:07.850 --> 08:09.850]  So let's talk about who I need as testers.
[08:09.850 --> 08:11.850]  Let me get myself back on track on my notes here.
[08:11.850 --> 08:13.850]  Who? Who do I need as testers?
[08:13.850 --> 08:15.850]  I need photographers.
[08:15.850 --> 08:21.850]  A lot of what I'm doing with testers is I'm looking for photos to put on my website for advertising.
[08:21.850 --> 08:22.850]  I put them on my website.
[08:22.850 --> 08:25.850]  They end up on SeedsHereNow, seedsherenow.com.
[08:25.850 --> 08:29.850]  They end up on all the other vendor websites so that you can see what the plants look like.
[08:29.850 --> 08:36.850]  And I want multiple people to take photos so we can get a realistic view of the phenotypes, the bud structures, the plant structures.
[08:36.850 --> 08:42.850]  I could take the picture of the single finest plant out of a batch of 1,000 seeds.
[08:42.850 --> 08:43.850]  I could grow them.
[08:43.850 --> 08:47.850]  I could spend all year just growing seeds of one strain and find the perfect plant and take pictures of that.
[08:47.850 --> 08:54.850]  I could post it, and I could say, that's the most beautiful picture of lady marmalade or whatever strain we want to use in this example.
[08:54.850 --> 08:56.850]  I could say, that's the most beautiful picture ever.
[08:56.850 --> 08:57.850]  That's what you're going to expect.
[08:57.850 --> 08:58.850]  That's not cool.
[08:58.850 --> 09:00.850]  I should pick a realistic example of the plants.
[09:00.850 --> 09:04.850]  By letting other people post the photos and share the photos, it's very realistic.
[09:04.850 --> 09:05.850]  They're getting it.
[09:05.850 --> 09:08.850]  I didn't send them specially selected seeds.
[09:08.850 --> 09:13.850]  I sent them seeds right out of the batch that will go out for everybody else if the seeds do pass testing.
[09:13.850 --> 09:14.850]  So that's realistic.
[09:14.850 --> 09:17.850]  I want photographers that could take good photos of these plants.
[09:17.850 --> 09:19.850]  I'm able to take the best photos.
[09:19.850 --> 09:20.850]  Like I said, they're my plants.
[09:20.850 --> 09:28.850]  I've got basically unlimited seeds, so I could just grow as many of those seeds as I want until I find the perfect photo, and then post that one up and say, that's my prized photo.
[09:28.850 --> 09:29.850]  But that's not fair.
[09:29.850 --> 09:31.850]  I want you to see what's really coming out of these plants.
[09:31.850 --> 09:33.850]  So I want photographers.
[09:33.850 --> 09:35.850]  I need website and advertising photos.
[09:35.850 --> 09:45.850]  I need new growers who will grow the plants their full ability but also kind of abuse the plants.
[09:45.850 --> 09:47.850]  I've got some staggered notes here.
[09:47.850 --> 09:52.850]  The growers that are going to slightly abuse the plants are also the growers who are going to be buying these seeds.
[09:52.850 --> 10:04.850]  So if you're a new grower and you're going to kind of abuse them but you're going to try your best but you're going to accidentally make mistakes, I like that because then I find if the plants can handle stress, can they handle problems, can they handle resistance.
[10:04.850 --> 10:07.850]  Like I said, people are going to get powdery mildew and spider mites.
[10:07.850 --> 10:11.850]  It's often those new growers that struggle with that, and we'll find out how these plants react to that.
[10:11.850 --> 10:15.850]  Those stressful situations are also where we're going to find intersex plants.
[10:15.850 --> 10:17.850]  My environments are nice.
[10:17.850 --> 10:20.850]  I'm not going to find a lot of intersex problems here unless I ask for it.
[10:20.850 --> 10:23.850]  If I go messing with the light cycles and shit, then I see weird things.
[10:23.850 --> 10:31.850]  But my rooms are great, my environment, my temperature, anywhere I work, anywhere I've got a plant, I've got a lot of equipment where it stays nice unless the power goes out.
[10:31.850 --> 10:33.850]  We've talked about that before.
[10:33.850 --> 10:34.850]  But I'm not going to see those problems.
[10:34.850 --> 10:37.850]  You're going to see them in those weird rooms.
[10:37.850 --> 10:38.850]  So I need photographers.
[10:38.850 --> 10:42.850]  I need new growers who will try their best but may accidentally cause some problems.
[10:43.850 --> 10:45.850]  Then I need pro growers as well.
[10:45.850 --> 10:48.850]  Pro growers are going to push these plants to their full potential.
[10:48.850 --> 10:52.850]  We're going to see the potential harvest weight, the potential potency.
[10:52.850 --> 10:54.850]  Then I want people that can get them tested.
[10:54.850 --> 10:58.850]  If you can get them lab tested in a lab, the finished product, that's one of my favorite things.
[10:58.850 --> 11:07.850]  So new growers, pro growers, photographers, people enthusiastic about cannabis, and then people who can follow instructions.
[11:07.850 --> 11:12.850]  One of the things I really need is people that can follow instructions and communicate with me on at least a weekly basis.
[11:12.850 --> 11:17.850]  We're going to talk a lot about that in this episode, the communication that I expect.
[11:17.850 --> 11:24.850]  One thing that I should say is I'm not looking for people who want free seeds, people who want to give me a shout out on social media for free seeds.
[11:24.850 --> 11:29.850]  What I'm looking for is people who are going to test these seeds under the criteria that I'm asking for.
[11:29.850 --> 11:32.850]  I'll give a pretty clear criteria, and that's what I'm looking for.
[11:32.850 --> 11:39.850]  I want to establish growers that have got a routine or a new grower who's trying to develop a routine, some sort of system, not a bunch of experimental stuff.
[11:39.850 --> 11:41.850]  That's who I'm looking for.
[11:41.850 --> 11:43.850]  Now let's talk about what I expect from a tester.
[11:43.850 --> 11:44.850]  What do I expect?
[11:44.850 --> 11:46.850]  I expect quick grows.
[11:46.850 --> 11:54.850]  Some people want to get, and this is cool if that's your way to do it, but when you first get a seed and you grow that seed, you don't know if it's going to be a male or a female.
[11:54.850 --> 11:55.850]  You don't know if it's going to be a mutant.
[11:55.850 --> 11:57.850]  You don't know if it's going to be intersex.
[11:57.850 --> 11:59.850]  You don't know if it's going to be shit completely.
[11:59.850 --> 12:00.850]  It could be hemp.
[12:00.850 --> 12:01.850]  It could just anything.
[12:01.850 --> 12:03.850]  Even if I bred it, it could still be terrible.
[12:03.850 --> 12:06.850]  You're taking a gamble with genetics.
[12:06.850 --> 12:08.850]  So I want quicker grows.
[12:08.850 --> 12:10.850]  I see people grow these giant plants.
[12:10.850 --> 12:16.850]  They start off, they just grow this brand new seed, and they grow it in a seven-gallon pot and grow it five feet tall and top it eight times.
[12:16.850 --> 12:18.850]  Bro, what if it's a male?
[12:18.850 --> 12:20.850]  We don't even know if that's a boy settled down.
[12:20.850 --> 12:22.850]  So I want quick grows.
[12:22.850 --> 12:23.850]  These are tester plants.
[12:23.850 --> 12:24.850]  I want you to test them.
[12:24.850 --> 12:25.850]  Don't play with them.
[12:25.850 --> 12:26.850]  Don't spend a lot of time.
[12:26.850 --> 12:28.850]  Get them in there, turn them, and burn them is what I say.
[12:29.850 --> 12:31.850]  Don't grow them out and waste your time and your space.
[12:31.850 --> 12:32.850]  I don't know if they're any good.
[12:32.850 --> 12:34.850]  I don't want you to waste your time and space.
[12:34.850 --> 12:37.850]  Don't excessively top them and train them.
[12:37.850 --> 12:39.850]  Don't spread them out and do weird shit to them.
[12:39.850 --> 12:42.850]  Maybe get them big enough to where you can take one, maybe three clones.
[12:42.850 --> 12:47.850]  If you really want to take the top, if that's your style, take the top out, take two clones off the bottom.
[12:47.850 --> 12:50.850]  As soon as you see roots on those clones, start flowering it.
[12:50.850 --> 12:52.850]  That's what I expect.
[12:52.850 --> 12:57.850]  A lot of times, I don't even take a clone off of a tester because if it's that good, we can revege it.
[12:57.850 --> 13:03.850]  If you really get something that's amazing and you didn't take a clone from a tester, it's most likely that I will send you another pack of seeds.
[13:03.850 --> 13:05.850]  You can find that phenotype again.
[13:05.850 --> 13:09.850]  Maybe do one top to get the shape you need, but don't go crazy.
[13:09.850 --> 13:11.850]  The goal is to see what we've got.
[13:11.850 --> 13:12.850]  We just want to grow them out.
[13:12.850 --> 13:13.850]  See what they do.
[13:13.850 --> 13:19.850]  If you go topping and manipulating it and training it and twisting it, it's going to do different shit than it normally would do if you just let it grow.
[13:19.850 --> 13:20.850]  Let it grow.
[13:20.850 --> 13:22.850]  I want to see what these plants do.
[13:22.850 --> 13:24.850]  Almost be kind of scientific.
[13:24.850 --> 13:25.850]  Don't do any experimental shit.
[13:26.850 --> 13:29.850]  Use a familiar feed and a familiar light.
[13:29.850 --> 13:32.850]  If you're an established grower, don't change anything.
[13:32.850 --> 13:33.850]  Don't swap.
[13:33.850 --> 13:35.850]  For these, I'm going to try using this plasma light.
[13:35.850 --> 13:36.850]  Don't do that, dude.
[13:36.850 --> 13:39.850]  Do the same light you've been doing forever so that you know what you're looking for.
[13:39.850 --> 13:40.850]  No variables this time.
[13:40.850 --> 13:42.850]  The only variables should be my seeds.
[13:42.850 --> 13:44.850]  That's the variable in here.
[13:44.850 --> 13:48.850]  Then here's something I really ask for when you are running testers.
[13:48.850 --> 13:51.850]  When we talk about it, we'll have a conversation before you get seeds.
[13:51.850 --> 13:52.850]  We'll email.
[13:52.850 --> 13:53.850]  We'll talk on social media.
[13:53.850 --> 13:54.850]  We're going to talk about it.
[13:54.850 --> 13:58.850]  We will establish how many seeds are going to be sent.
[13:58.850 --> 14:02.850]  I prefer you to run all of those seeds at one time.
[14:02.850 --> 14:04.850]  Pop them all at the same time.
[14:04.850 --> 14:06.850]  Do the same thing to every single one of them.
[14:06.850 --> 14:11.850]  If you get 10 seeds, germinate the 10 seeds in your germination method.
[14:11.850 --> 14:12.850]  Grow them your way.
[14:12.850 --> 14:15.850]  Transplant them your way, but do the same thing to all 10 of them.
[14:15.850 --> 14:17.850]  This is a scientific approach.
[14:17.850 --> 14:19.850]  Do the same thing, please.
[14:20.850 --> 14:24.850]  Also, when you go doing things, not just run them all at the same time,
[14:24.850 --> 14:25.850]  do the same thing.
[14:25.850 --> 14:26.850]  Everything.
[14:26.850 --> 14:28.850]  I keep saying that, but that's important.
[14:28.850 --> 14:29.850]  Transplant them at the same time.
[14:29.850 --> 14:32.850]  If you put recharge on one of them, put recharge on 10 of them.
[14:32.850 --> 14:34.850]  Don't do recharge on half.
[14:34.850 --> 14:35.850]  Don't top half of them.
[14:35.850 --> 14:36.850]  Don't fucking do.
[14:36.850 --> 14:38.850]  Please do the same thing to all 10 of your seeds.
[14:38.850 --> 14:41.850]  If you get six, do it to all six.
[14:41.850 --> 14:42.850]  This is scientific.
[14:42.850 --> 14:45.850]  Maybe one phenotype is going to grow tall and stretchy.
[14:45.850 --> 14:46.850]  One will grow short and bushy.
[14:46.850 --> 14:48.850]  One is going to grow wide.
[14:48.850 --> 14:51.850]  How are we going to know that if you top them all excessively?
[14:51.850 --> 14:54.850]  How are we going to know the difference if you fed one a bunch of recharge
[14:54.850 --> 14:56.850]  and didn't feed this one recharge?
[14:56.850 --> 14:59.850]  The one with recharge is obviously going to root out harder, do more shit,
[14:59.850 --> 15:01.850]  so it's not going to be a fair test.
[15:01.850 --> 15:02.850]  We want a fair fight here.
[15:02.850 --> 15:03.850]  We're looking for the winners.
[15:03.850 --> 15:05.850]  We're looking to see what we've got.
[15:05.850 --> 15:08.850]  Give them all the same thing, the same environment.
[15:08.850 --> 15:10.850]  Keep it scientific.
[15:10.850 --> 15:14.850]  Then I can't release the seeds until they have been tested thoroughly by myself
[15:14.850 --> 15:17.850]  and by my testing team, and hopefully that is you.
[15:17.850 --> 15:21.850]  I'm relying on you to test them, take pictures of them, give me reports,
[15:21.850 --> 15:23.850]  so that we can get them to the market,
[15:23.850 --> 15:26.850]  to the other people who have been watching your photos who have been drooling over
[15:26.850 --> 15:29.850]  them because I don't put anything out until it is thoroughly tested.
[15:29.850 --> 15:31.850]  It frustrates the shit out of people.
[15:31.850 --> 15:34.850]  They see you running testers and are like, come on, I want that, I want that.
[15:34.850 --> 15:36.850]  I'm like, I'm waiting for three more people to give me results.
[15:36.850 --> 15:40.850]  Once I've got 10 people that say they were hot fire and zero reports of shit,
[15:40.850 --> 15:41.850]  they'll come out.
[15:41.850 --> 15:43.850]  So do it kind of quickly, please.
[15:43.850 --> 15:48.850]  If you do a good job, you become already added to the list of potential testers
[15:48.850 --> 15:49.850]  in the future.
[15:49.850 --> 15:53.850]  If you do a good job with this round of testers, the next time I need testers,
[15:53.850 --> 15:54.850]  I don't even send out the email.
[15:54.850 --> 15:57.850]  I go, well, let's find 10 people from this one and send it to them first.
[15:57.850 --> 15:58.850]  You get the first batch.
[15:58.850 --> 16:00.850]  The testers go out in waves.
[16:00.850 --> 16:02.850]  I let people get them in veg, get them going.
[16:02.850 --> 16:03.850]  I send out more.
[16:03.850 --> 16:05.850]  I go drop off testers at friends' houses.
[16:05.850 --> 16:06.850]  They go out in waves.
[16:06.850 --> 16:07.850]  Shipping is kind of expensive.
[16:07.850 --> 16:08.850]  I do it all on priority mail.
[16:08.850 --> 16:11.850]  It's also hard to keep up with everybody when you do it all at once.
[16:11.850 --> 16:14.850]  I do them in little waves, in little groups, and I can remember group one got this,
[16:14.850 --> 16:15.850]  group two got this.
[16:15.850 --> 16:19.850]  So if you do a really good job and you didn't keep clones, like I said before,
[16:19.850 --> 16:21.850]  you may get more seeds.
[16:21.850 --> 16:22.850]  You may get a pet.
[16:22.850 --> 16:23.850]  I'll give you more shit.
[16:23.850 --> 16:25.850]  If you tested stuff and you ran out and you didn't keep a clone,
[16:25.850 --> 16:28.850]  I'll give you more seeds, but I'd prefer to give you new shit.
[16:28.850 --> 16:30.850]  So just expect new shit from me.
[16:30.850 --> 16:34.850]  So now I keep saying I want – excuse me, I'm not even going to edit that.
[16:34.850 --> 16:35.850]  I feel like I'm flowing.
[16:35.850 --> 16:37.850]  I'll take a drink of water and keep going.
[16:37.850 --> 16:40.850]  I keep saying there are a lot of things I want you to report back to me
[16:40.850 --> 16:41.850]  and communicate with me on.
[16:41.850 --> 16:45.850]  Here are a lot of the things I want you to take notes on and communicate to me.
[16:45.850 --> 16:47.850]  I expect weekly communication.
[16:47.850 --> 16:48.850]  Send me pictures weekly.
[16:48.850 --> 16:51.850]  Even in veg, I want to know what they look like when they're little itty babies.
[16:51.850 --> 16:53.850]  I want to see my babies as they grow up.
[16:53.850 --> 16:55.850]  So send me germination pictures.
[16:55.850 --> 16:56.850]  How many seeds germinated?
[16:56.850 --> 16:58.850]  How many looked like shit?
[16:58.850 --> 16:59.850]  How many did you get?
[16:59.850 --> 17:01.850]  Let me know how many you got so we can know the ratio.
[17:01.850 --> 17:04.850]  If you got 100 seeds and 4 did not germinate, that's not bad numbers.
[17:04.850 --> 17:07.850]  If you got 5 and 4 didn't germinate, we've got to throw those seeds away
[17:07.850 --> 17:09.850]  or figure out what you did wrong.
[17:09.850 --> 17:12.850]  So here are some of the things that I want you to communicate with me
[17:12.850 --> 17:14.850]  and take detailed notes on.
[17:14.850 --> 17:17.850]  All right, so when you start emailing me or sending me your test strain report,
[17:17.850 --> 17:20.850]  always include what strain you are growing.
[17:20.850 --> 17:22.850]  I try to stay on top of it, know who's got what,
[17:22.850 --> 17:24.850]  but I've got multiple testers out there right now,
[17:24.850 --> 17:27.850]  so please remind me what strain you're growing.
[17:27.850 --> 17:31.850]  Then I like to know things like simply how are you growing your plants.
[17:31.850 --> 17:32.850]  Are you in hydro?
[17:32.850 --> 17:33.850]  Are you in soil or soilless mix?
[17:33.850 --> 17:35.850]  Are you in a no-till environment?
[17:35.850 --> 17:36.850]  Tell me about your medium.
[17:36.850 --> 17:37.850]  What's in your pots?
[17:37.850 --> 17:38.850]  Are you in big beds?
[17:38.850 --> 17:39.850]  Are you in small pots?
[17:39.850 --> 17:40.850]  Are you in 1 gallons?
[17:40.850 --> 17:41.850]  Are you in 3 gallons?
[17:41.850 --> 17:42.850]  Tell me everything.
[17:42.850 --> 17:44.850]  I want to know all about it.
[17:44.850 --> 17:45.850]  Are you in a big room?
[17:45.850 --> 17:46.850]  Are you growing in a tent?
[17:46.850 --> 17:47.850]  Then here are the fun details.
[17:47.850 --> 17:49.850]  Are you using LEDs?
[17:49.850 --> 17:50.850]  What kind of LEDs?
[17:50.850 --> 17:52.850]  What kind of lights are you using?
[17:52.850 --> 17:53.850]  What kind of cobs?
[17:53.850 --> 17:56.850]  I don't know a lot about LEDs, but tell me because I like to know all that stuff
[17:56.850 --> 18:00.850]  because people ask me in the future how do they do under these kind of LEDs,
[18:00.850 --> 18:02.850]  and I can go back and look and I can say,
[18:02.850 --> 18:05.850]  well, tester ABB grew them under those and they did a hell of a job
[18:05.850 --> 18:07.850]  or they didn't look so good under those.
[18:07.850 --> 18:09.850]  I want to know all the reports about it.
[18:09.850 --> 18:11.850]  Are you growing under high-pressure sodiums?
[18:11.850 --> 18:13.850]  Are you growing under ceramic metal halides?
[18:13.850 --> 18:14.850]  Are you growing under those?
[18:14.850 --> 18:16.850]  What are the other lights I can't even think of right now?
[18:16.850 --> 18:22.850]  Plasmas, ceramic metal halides, LEDs, HPS, high-pressure sodiums,
[18:22.850 --> 18:24.850]  ceramic metal, I said a lot of lighting.
[18:24.850 --> 18:25.850]  What kind of lights are you growing under?
[18:25.850 --> 18:26.850]  You get my damn point.
[18:26.850 --> 18:28.850]  What is the pH of your feed solution?
[18:28.850 --> 18:30.850]  How are the plants responding to those feeds?
[18:30.850 --> 18:33.850]  What is the temperature and humidity of your environment?
[18:33.850 --> 18:35.850]  That's something that always tells me a lot of stuff.
[18:35.850 --> 18:37.850]  If the plants look clawed out and it's too hot in there,
[18:37.850 --> 18:39.850]  or if it's too wet in there, that will tell me something.
[18:39.850 --> 18:41.850]  It's not just the plants, it's the environment.
[18:41.850 --> 18:44.850]  But how are they reacting to those environmental factors?
[18:44.850 --> 18:49.850]  Then also I want to know germination rates, male-to-female ratios.
[18:49.850 --> 18:52.850]  If I gave you regular seeds, even if I gave you fem seeds,
[18:52.850 --> 18:55.850]  what's the ratio of male-to-female plants out of the plants you got?
[18:55.850 --> 18:57.850]  Were there any intersex plants and how many?
[18:57.850 --> 19:01.850]  What is the ratio of intersex plants to non-intersex plants?
[19:01.850 --> 19:04.850]  What was the week that you found intersex plants?
[19:04.850 --> 19:07.850]  If you were growing the plants and some intersex plants came up,
[19:07.850 --> 19:10.850]  what week did you determine that?
[19:10.850 --> 19:13.850]  Let's see, how many plants made it to the flowering room?
[19:13.850 --> 19:16.850]  If you planted 10 plants and you eliminated some because they were males,
[19:16.850 --> 19:18.850]  you eliminated some just because you didn't like them,
[19:18.850 --> 19:20.850]  how many made it to the flowering room?
[19:20.850 --> 19:23.850]  Did you have any issues in the grow is something I always want to know.
[19:23.850 --> 19:24.850]  Was there powdery mildew?
[19:24.850 --> 19:25.850]  Did you have spider mites?
[19:25.850 --> 19:26.850]  Did you find boetritis?
[19:26.850 --> 19:27.850]  Did you get thrips?
[19:27.850 --> 19:28.850]  Did you overfeed?
[19:28.850 --> 19:29.850]  Did you underfeed?
[19:29.850 --> 19:30.850]  Did you have a power outage?
[19:30.850 --> 19:32.850]  Did something go wrong?
[19:32.850 --> 19:36.850]  All of those things will play a factor in the appearance and performance of your plant.
[19:36.850 --> 19:38.850]  So I need to know that stuff.
[19:38.850 --> 19:40.850]  Like if you're saying, hey, Jeff's acting really weird lately.
[19:40.850 --> 19:42.850]  I don't know what's going on with him.
[19:42.850 --> 19:45.850]  But then if you find out that like, if again, all day long these lights are in my face,
[19:45.850 --> 19:47.850]  you'd go, well, yeah, he's going fucking crazy.
[19:47.850 --> 19:48.850]  It's because of those fucking lights.
[19:48.850 --> 19:49.850]  So you'd understand it.
[19:49.850 --> 19:51.850]  But if you went, I don't know, man, everything seems fine with him.
[19:51.850 --> 19:52.850]  You'd just think I'm losing my mind.
[19:52.850 --> 19:55.850]  But these bright lights right here in your face all day would make you go fucking crazy.
[19:55.850 --> 19:58.850]  So if you knew that, that may play a different,
[19:58.850 --> 20:01.850]  you may know you understand the solution to why things are going on.
[20:01.850 --> 20:02.850]  So let me know what's happening in that grow.
[20:02.850 --> 20:03.850]  Let me know if you had any problems.
[20:03.850 --> 20:06.850]  Let me know if you're putting the bright light in the plant's face all night.
[20:06.850 --> 20:07.850]  Let me know what's going on.
[20:07.850 --> 20:08.850]  Then where are we?
[20:08.850 --> 20:10.850]  I want to find my spot on these notes here.
[20:10.850 --> 20:14.850]  How did the plants react to the issues that it encountered?
[20:14.850 --> 20:16.850]  If you got spider mites, did it love them?
[20:16.850 --> 20:17.850]  Did it hate them?
[20:17.850 --> 20:19.850]  Was it easy to treat for them?
[20:19.850 --> 20:22.850]  When you treated for them, how did the plants respond to that?
[20:22.850 --> 20:25.850]  Were there other plants in this grow with the testers?
[20:25.850 --> 20:29.850]  How did those plants look overall compared to my tester plants?
[20:29.850 --> 20:32.850]  Did they look amazing next to my plants?
[20:32.850 --> 20:34.850]  Did my plants look like shit next to them?
[20:34.850 --> 20:36.850]  How did my plants look amazing?
[20:36.850 --> 20:37.850]  You know what I'm saying, right?
[20:37.850 --> 20:38.850]  How did they compare?
[20:38.850 --> 20:39.850]  I want to know, bro.
[20:39.850 --> 20:41.850]  Is mine, do I look better than your other plants?
[20:41.850 --> 20:43.850]  Do my plants look better than yours?
[20:43.850 --> 20:45.850]  Then how did those plants, here's the important part,
[20:45.850 --> 20:48.850]  how did those plants react to the same issues?
[20:48.850 --> 20:51.850]  If you got spider mites, did my plants handle it better than the plants
[20:51.850 --> 20:54.850]  that you got from another breeder that you're familiar with?
[20:54.850 --> 20:55.850]  How did they react?
[20:55.850 --> 20:56.850]  Did they do it?
[20:56.850 --> 20:58.850]  Then I've got more questions here.
[20:58.850 --> 21:01.850]  How did they compare overall in your overall grow?
[21:01.850 --> 21:03.850]  Like just overall, how did they perform?
[21:03.850 --> 21:06.850]  How was the overall yield, the performance, the potency, the flavor?
[21:06.850 --> 21:07.850]  How was it?
[21:07.850 --> 21:10.850]  Then the main question that I'd like to ask my testers is,
[21:10.850 --> 21:12.850]  would you buy these seeds again?
[21:12.850 --> 21:14.850]  Had you not been gifted these seeds?
[21:14.850 --> 21:17.850]  If you had paid retail price for these seeds, would you have said,
[21:17.850 --> 21:19.850]  damn, that was a good investment?
[21:19.850 --> 21:22.850]  Or would you have said, shit, I just wasted that much money on seeds
[21:22.850 --> 21:24.850]  and nutrients and electricity?
[21:24.850 --> 21:27.850]  Because I understand as a breeder, as a fellow grower,
[21:27.850 --> 21:31.850]  I know that it costs money just to turn on the fucking light,
[21:31.850 --> 21:33.850]  to buy the light costs money.
[21:33.850 --> 21:35.850]  It costs money just to plug it in.
[21:35.850 --> 21:38.850]  Every second that light's running, there's money coming out of your pocket.
[21:38.850 --> 21:39.850]  You've got to buy nutrients.
[21:39.850 --> 21:40.850]  You've got to buy soil.
[21:40.850 --> 21:42.850]  It costs money just to have that plant in the room.
[21:42.850 --> 21:43.850]  I understand that.
[21:43.850 --> 21:47.850]  So I want to know as a breeder, would you have been happy to pay money
[21:47.850 --> 21:49.850]  for those seeds, or would you have just came back
[21:49.850 --> 21:52.850]  and thrown the fucking root ball at me and been like, fuck these plants, bro?
[21:52.850 --> 21:53.850]  I want to know the truth.
[21:53.850 --> 21:56.850]  Be honest with me as a breeder, as a grower, as a tester.
[21:56.850 --> 21:57.850]  What do I need from you?
[21:57.850 --> 21:59.850]  So where are we going to go from there?
[21:59.850 --> 22:01.850]  I know I have a lot more notes.
[22:01.850 --> 22:06.850]  I'd really like weekly updates and photos and as much data as possible.
[22:06.850 --> 22:07.850]  Don't be shy.
[22:07.850 --> 22:09.850]  Some people are like, I don't know if you want this info.
[22:09.850 --> 22:10.850]  I do want that info.
[22:10.850 --> 22:11.850]  Any info you've got.
[22:11.850 --> 22:13.850]  Some people think differently than me.
[22:13.850 --> 22:14.850]  They've got different ideas.
[22:14.850 --> 22:15.850]  I want your information.
[22:15.850 --> 22:17.850]  Let me know what you're thinking.
[22:17.850 --> 22:18.850]  How's it growing?
[22:18.850 --> 22:19.850]  Did you see anything weird?
[22:19.850 --> 22:23.850]  Then I would like a flavor and aroma and smoke report.
[22:23.850 --> 22:24.850]  Let me know what it was like.
[22:24.850 --> 22:27.850]  Did the flavors and aromas change throughout the growth?
[22:27.850 --> 22:29.850]  Sometimes it'll start off sweet and end up funky.
[22:29.850 --> 22:31.850]  Sometimes it'll start funky and end up sweet.
[22:31.850 --> 22:34.850]  Sometimes it smells like vomit, smells like poop in the end.
[22:34.850 --> 22:36.850]  Sometimes it smells like poop and it turns into vomit.
[22:36.850 --> 22:37.850]  I don't know.
[22:37.850 --> 22:38.850]  Let me know what happened there.
[22:38.850 --> 22:40.850]  Then send me photos.
[22:40.850 --> 22:44.850]  I want photos and more photos and then more photos.
[22:44.850 --> 22:46.850]  I want your style of photos, however you take them.
[22:46.850 --> 22:50.850]  Then try to get me that really cool bud shot photo that you see that I post
[22:50.850 --> 22:53.850]  for all the advertising and all my strains.
[22:53.850 --> 22:57.850]  If you give me that cool bud shot photo that looks amazing from the right angle,
[22:57.850 --> 23:01.850]  that makes it look perfect, that is going to work well in magazines and on the websites,
[23:01.850 --> 23:03.850]  I will use that on the website.
[23:03.850 --> 23:04.850]  You'll get credit for it.
[23:04.850 --> 23:07.850]  Then again, you always get gifts when I do that sort of stuff.
[23:07.850 --> 23:09.850]  Where are we?
[23:09.850 --> 23:11.850]  I got lost in my notes trying to find myself here again.
[23:11.850 --> 23:13.850]  Let me know how it smokes, flavor, aroma.
[23:13.850 --> 23:14.850]  How was the potency?
[23:14.850 --> 23:16.850]  How was the high?
[23:16.850 --> 23:18.850]  Were you able to get it lab tested?
[23:18.850 --> 23:21.850]  If you're able to get it lab tested, I really like that.
[23:21.850 --> 23:23.850]  Let me know if you can get potency testing.
[23:23.850 --> 23:25.850]  Let me know if you can get terpene testing.
[23:25.850 --> 23:31.850]  I will definitely trade you more seeds in return for your lab test
[23:31.850 --> 23:32.850]  because I know those tests are not cheap.
[23:32.850 --> 23:35.850]  They're expensive and it costs you some of your product.
[23:35.850 --> 23:37.850]  You got to sacrifice a little bit of your herb to give it to the lab.
[23:37.850 --> 23:41.850]  I will send you more seeds for your lab test.
[23:41.850 --> 23:44.850]  Then like I said before, my favorite question is,
[23:44.850 --> 23:47.850]  would you buy these seeds again or would you have been satisfied
[23:47.850 --> 23:50.850]  if you paid for these seeds out of your pocket?
[23:50.850 --> 23:53.850]  If I didn't send them to you to test, would you do it again?
[23:53.850 --> 23:55.850]  Would you have felt like you got ripped off?
[23:55.850 --> 23:58.850]  Those are a lot of the things I expect that I require from a tester.
[23:58.850 --> 23:59.850]  We're going to talk more about that.
[23:59.850 --> 24:02.850]  When we email back and forth, there will be some fine details.
[24:02.850 --> 24:09.850]  One thing that I do like to stress is please, please do not share
[24:09.850 --> 24:14.850]  or give away these seeds or clones until I decide if they are to be given away,
[24:14.850 --> 24:17.850]  shared, sold, or put out for the market.
[24:17.850 --> 24:21.850]  If you give out some stuff that is a tester, it may not meet my standards.
[24:21.850 --> 24:24.850]  That's why you're testing it. I've trusted you to test it.
[24:24.850 --> 24:27.850]  You can post pictures of it, but let's not spread it.
[24:27.850 --> 24:33.850]  Our job as a cannabis community, my job as a breeder, is to put out good shit.
[24:33.850 --> 24:38.850]  Let's set up our fellow growers, our friends, for success by giving them better genetics.
[24:38.850 --> 24:42.850]  If my testers don't qualify, let's not pass them out.
[24:42.850 --> 24:46.850]  Let's wait until I can send you some seeds that are 10s instead of fucking 7s
[24:46.850 --> 24:48.850]  and you can pass out those 10s.
[24:48.850 --> 24:50.850]  But just please wait until I've given you permission,
[24:50.850 --> 24:54.850]  given you the go-ahead to release clones or seeds of testers.
[24:54.850 --> 24:58.850]  They're testers. Test them yourself. Hoard them.
[24:58.850 --> 25:00.850]  You're the only one with them right now.
[25:00.850 --> 25:02.850]  If you're a medical grower, you've got the best medicine around.
[25:02.850 --> 25:06.850]  If you're a fucking black market or a free market, whatever you want to call it,
[25:06.850 --> 25:09.850]  if you're a profit grower, you've got the only batch of these seeds around.
[25:09.850 --> 25:13.850]  Set yourself apart from the market. Stand out. Don't share this shit.
[25:13.850 --> 25:16.850]  Hoard it. Do what you can to leverage the market with this product.
[25:16.850 --> 25:18.850]  That's how things go.
[25:18.850 --> 25:22.850]  You're auditioning these seeds to see if they make it to the fucking...
[25:22.850 --> 25:24.850]  This is the casting couch, bro.
[25:24.850 --> 25:27.850]  We're not going to put them in front of the camera until we've auditioned them.
[25:27.850 --> 25:31.850]  So we want to find out if they are worth introducing them to the community.
[25:31.850 --> 25:34.850]  So please don't share them. Please, please keep them close.
[25:34.850 --> 25:35.850]  Grow them the best you can.
[25:35.850 --> 25:39.850]  And you've been trusted with new shit, so don't spread the new shit until...
[25:39.850 --> 25:44.850]  Basically, I'm going to ask you to hold on to it until you officially see me release it on the websites.
[25:44.850 --> 25:48.850]  Once it's on seedsherenow.com or the other websites, then you've got the go-ahead.
[25:48.850 --> 25:52.850]  If it doesn't make it there, I'm probably going to ask you to not share it.
[25:52.850 --> 25:54.850]  Just keep that cut for yourself.
[25:54.850 --> 25:57.850]  Of course, when you say, please don't share that cut in the cannabis community,
[25:57.850 --> 26:03.850]  that's like French for give as many clones of this fucking plant out as you can as quickly as possible.
[26:03.850 --> 26:06.850]  But I love you guys and I trust you until I select my tester.
[26:07.850 --> 26:09.850]  Let's see. Where are we from here?
[26:09.850 --> 26:13.850]  I think this is the part where everybody says, now how do we become a tester?
[26:13.850 --> 26:16.850]  You've told us what we need to do. I told you what I expect.
[26:16.850 --> 26:18.850]  I told you how to communicate with me.
[26:18.850 --> 26:21.850]  I expect you to grow them the best you can. Take good notes.
[26:21.850 --> 26:24.850]  Don't do anything crazy. This is a scientific experiment.
[26:24.850 --> 26:25.850]  We're trying to see what you've got there.
[26:25.850 --> 26:28.850]  Then I expect you to communicate with me.
[26:28.850 --> 26:31.850]  Weekly reports. I want to know how many males and females you've got.
[26:31.850 --> 26:33.850]  I want to know how many germinated.
[26:33.850 --> 26:35.850]  I want to know if you've got any weirdos out of there.
[26:35.850 --> 26:39.850]  How many made it to flower? When they got it to flower, did you see any weird shit going on?
[26:39.850 --> 26:42.850]  How many got to finish? What was your harvest weight?
[26:42.850 --> 26:44.850]  Give me a smoke report. What's it smoke like? What's it smell like?
[26:44.850 --> 26:47.850]  What's it taste like? What kind of buzz did you get?
[26:47.850 --> 26:51.850]  Anything stand out. Then I want to know how it dealt with problems and issues.
[26:51.850 --> 26:54.850]  Anything you think I should know, tell me. Just let me know.
[26:54.850 --> 26:57.850]  Be like, hey, this happened and your plant did this.
[26:57.850 --> 27:00.850]  Just act like it's my kids and you think I should check on my kids and put them in line?
[27:00.850 --> 27:02.850]  Let me know what the fuck is going on.
[27:02.850 --> 27:05.850]  Then don't share the stuff. Build a relationship with me.
[27:05.850 --> 27:10.850]  Let me trust you and then you will be in line to get more and more and more tester seeds as time goes on.
[27:10.850 --> 27:15.850]  Now, here is how you're going to be able to get in line to be a tester.
[27:15.850 --> 27:17.850]  All right. I know a lot of people are waiting for this part.
[27:17.850 --> 27:19.850]  They want to know how they can become a tester.
[27:19.850 --> 27:24.850]  I talked earlier that social media and the forums and my group of friends are a great way to find testers.
[27:24.850 --> 27:26.850]  Here is how everybody out there gets a fair chance.
[27:26.850 --> 27:29.850]  The easiest way to become a tester is to email me.
[27:29.850 --> 27:32.850]  Email me at iRegenetics at Hotmail.com.
[27:32.850 --> 27:38.850]  Send me three photos of your grow that make you think I would be impressed by your grow
[27:38.850 --> 27:41.850]  and make me want to allow you to test my seeds.
[27:41.850 --> 27:44.850]  Then here is where we get specific with instructions.
[27:44.850 --> 27:47.850]  You've got to be able to follow instructions to be a tester.
[27:47.850 --> 27:48.850]  So here is where we start.
[27:48.850 --> 27:53.850]  Put the word tester application in the subject line.
[27:53.850 --> 27:56.850]  Tester application. That way I already know what I'm looking at.
[27:56.850 --> 28:00.850]  When I'm looking for testers, I can type in search word tester. It's right there.
[28:00.850 --> 28:04.850]  Then tell me a little bit about your grow and your grow style.
[28:04.850 --> 28:07.850]  Are you growing hydro? Are you growing in soilless mix?
[28:07.850 --> 28:10.850]  Are you growing no-till? What kind of lights are you using?
[28:10.850 --> 28:13.850]  Is it going to be in a commercial grow? Is it going to be in a tent?
[28:13.850 --> 28:16.850]  What are you doing? Let me know where these seeds are going to go.
[28:16.850 --> 28:18.850]  I want to know what kind of fish tank you're going to put my pets in.
[28:18.850 --> 28:19.850]  Tell me about that.
[28:19.850 --> 28:22.850]  Then tell me a little bit about your grow style.
[28:22.850 --> 28:25.850]  What do you do? Just how do you grow? What do you do in there?
[28:25.850 --> 28:29.850]  Then tell me a little bit about your grow history and your grow skill level.
[28:29.850 --> 28:33.850]  You're just auditioning, sending me a short brief resume about your grow.
[28:33.850 --> 28:36.850]  Then tell me why you qualify to be a tester.
[28:36.850 --> 28:39.850]  What makes you think that you qualify to be a tester for me?
[28:39.850 --> 28:42.850]  That sounded very, sounded worse than it was meant to.
[28:42.850 --> 28:44.850]  Why do you think you qualify to be a tester?
[28:44.850 --> 28:46.850]  It shouldn't sound as egotistical as it did,
[28:46.850 --> 28:49.850]  but let me know why you think you qualify to test my seeds.
[28:49.850 --> 28:54.850]  Then include your social media name and handles so that I can creep on all your stuff
[28:54.850 --> 28:57.850]  but not click like on anything so you never know I was there.
[28:57.850 --> 29:00.850]  Put your Cannabuzz handle up there. Put your Instagram handle.
[29:00.850 --> 29:02.850]  I rarely go look at your YouTube videos.
[29:02.850 --> 29:04.850]  A lot of people are like, look at my YouTube.
[29:04.850 --> 29:07.850]  Not going to do it. Put your Instagram and Cannabuzz up there.
[29:07.850 --> 29:09.850]  Very likely that I'll go check those out.
[29:09.850 --> 29:11.850]  Other things, I won't.
[29:11.850 --> 29:13.850]  YouTube, I got to watch the video scroll by.
[29:13.850 --> 29:15.850]  I've got ADD. I don't want to wait for your video.
[29:15.850 --> 29:18.850]  Instagram, I can look and I can scroll as quickly as I want.
[29:18.850 --> 29:22.850]  I can decide quite quickly if your photos are what I want for my seeds.
[29:23.850 --> 29:26.850]  All right. So I'll wrap that up one more time.
[29:26.850 --> 29:29.850]  Send three photos to iReadGeneticsAtHotMail.com.
[29:29.850 --> 29:32.850]  Put the words tester application in the subject line.
[29:32.850 --> 29:35.850]  Tell me a little bit about your grow and your grow style.
[29:35.850 --> 29:40.850]  Tell me a little bit about your grow history and your grow skill level.
[29:40.850 --> 29:42.850]  Tell me about your lights, your nutrients.
[29:42.850 --> 29:44.850]  I want to know what kind of nutrients you're using.
[29:44.850 --> 29:45.850]  That is definitely cool.
[29:45.850 --> 29:47.850]  Then tell me why you qualify to be a tester.
[29:47.850 --> 29:51.850]  Then include your social media credentials so I can creep on you.
[29:51.850 --> 29:53.850]  Again, not click like on any of your stuff.
[29:53.850 --> 29:56.850]  I'm just kidding, you guys. I do like all kinds of people's stuff.
[29:56.850 --> 29:59.850]  I like stuff. When you post pictures of other breeders' plants,
[29:59.850 --> 30:02.850]  I even click like on that because if you post cool pictures,
[30:02.850 --> 30:04.850]  you deserve a damn like and I click like.
[30:04.850 --> 30:06.850]  I'm not stingy with the likes, bro.
[30:06.850 --> 30:08.850]  All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[30:08.850 --> 30:12.850]  friends and foes, smokers and growers, new tester friends,

[30:55.850 --> 30:57.850]  The shows come out at midnight.
[30:57.850 --> 30:58.850]  It is Sunday night.
[30:58.850 --> 31:00.850]  It's Monday morning at midnight.
[31:00.850 --> 31:01.850]  It is 12 o'clock.
[31:01.850 --> 31:03.850]  Is that Monday or Sunday?
[31:03.850 --> 31:04.850]  Whatever, dude.
[31:04.850 --> 31:05.850]  It's midnight that turns into Monday.
[31:05.850 --> 31:06.850]  That's what I'm talking about.
[31:06.850 --> 31:10.850]  And the midnight that goes from Wednesday to Thursday, that 12 o'clock right there,
[31:10.850 --> 31:14.850]  I do the premiere of the new episode there on YouTube quite often.
[31:14.850 --> 31:17.850]  I hang out and I hang out in the chat and I troll you guys.
[31:17.850 --> 31:19.850]  And we tell jokes and talk trash to each other.
[31:19.850 --> 31:20.850]  It is a fun time.
[31:20.850 --> 31:22.850]  I invite you to be on the premiere.
[31:22.850 --> 31:23.850]  It's always fun.
[31:23.850 --> 31:24.850]  Check it out.

[31:32.850 --> 31:34.850]  I hope you get to become a tester.
[31:34.850 --> 31:35.850]  This was a fun episode.
[31:35.850 --> 31:37.850]  I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
[31:37.850 --> 31:38.850]  No, I'll be back in a couple of days.
[31:38.850 --> 31:39.850]  What the hell am I even saying?
[31:39.850 --> 31:41.850]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[31:41.850 --> 31:43.850]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend S. McAllen.
[31:43.850 --> 31:48.850]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
