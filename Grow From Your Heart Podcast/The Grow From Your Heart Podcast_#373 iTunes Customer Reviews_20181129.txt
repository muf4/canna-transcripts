[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Welcome to the show everybody! It's time for episode 373 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.000]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[00:13.000 --> 00:19.000]  and you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I am smoking.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  I'm kind of spoiling myself today. I've got a jar of pre-98 Bubba Kush batter
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  that just smells amazing. The aromas coming out of this jar are earthy.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  There is a hint of feet and a hint of fuel.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  And it definitely just smells exactly what you would expect pre-98 Bubba Kush to smell like.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  This is a beautiful run of pre-98 Bubba Kush. So I've got the batter of pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  Then I took some of the internally flawless diamonds and I put a couple of chunks of the IFS diamonds
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  right into the batter. So I've got a pretty chunky size dab of the batter with a couple of nice chunks
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  of the IFS diamonds in there. Then I took that and I rubbed it around in some of these
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  Stardog Fambrosia turps. When you buy a Fambrosia jar, it's a 4 gram jar of the Ambrosia.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  They give you a really nice portion of the crystals,
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  the HCFSE, the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  You also get a bunch of the HT, the high terpene full spectrum extract sauce at the bottom of it.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  I feel like I quite often have a lot of that terp sauce left over.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  So I took the battery dab that has the crystals in it and I just used it as a mop to kind of sweep up
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  some of those leftover Stardog turps. So that gives me this pre-98 Bubba Kush
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  battery base with a big internally flawless diamond sprinkled on top of that.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  The internally flawless series diamonds, by the way, are, let's see what the label says here.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  This says 82.5% THC and a total of 94% total cannabinoids.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  These look like little, kind of look like ice cubes or diamonds in the container.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  They are internally flawless diamonds and they are beautiful. They don't have much flavor,
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  but they do pack a serious punch with potency. So I chisel
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  off a little bit of the diamonds. I mix that up into the batter that makes the batter more potent.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  It also adds some flavor to those diamonds because they don't have a lot of flavor themselves.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  Then I mop up that Stardog turp with that little concoction there. The Stardog turps absorb right into that
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  batter. You can watch it all just become one nice little puddle in my giant dabber, which is basically a
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  shovel at this point. And the high from this dab, you guys is tremendous.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  First of all, when it hits you, you get a blast of Stardog turps. It's gassy.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  It is fuely. It is funky. There's a hint of maybe some sort of
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  candied fruit in the background, just a very faint hint. And then as soon as it hits your tongue real
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  well, that pre-98 Bubba Kush earthiness just takes over. So you have this
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  fuely, earthy, beautiful, savory flavor on your tongue. Then before you even
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  start exhaling, before you start blowing out that fat dab, I start feeling the Stardog get right in the middle
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  of my brain and start making my brain go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And it makes my eyes go, oh, yeah, here comes something.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  And then I feel that pre-98 Bubba Kush rest across my shoulders. And it just says, hey, relax a little bit.
[03:14.000 --> 03:24.000]  And it kind of, you know, when somebody comes up from behind you and they give you that little rub on the shoulders, the two thumbs right there in those little sore spots in the back of your shoulders, they push their fingers into your little neck muscles right there.
[03:24.000 --> 03:34.000]  And it's just like the pre-98 Bubba Kush just comes up and gives you one of those sweet massages, just like a little rub. And then your head's all high from the Stardog. And then you slowly feel the pre-98 Bubba Kush work its way down your spine.
[03:34.000 --> 03:45.000]  It relaxes your back, your spine, your muscles, your whole body just starts to chill out. And it feels really well. So the Stardog makes your brain go crazy. The pre-98 Bubba Kush hits the body beautifully.
[03:46.000 --> 03:59.000]  And then you get that beautiful taste of the Stardog and the beautiful flavor of that kind of coffee, earthy pre-98. It just kind of lingers on your tongue. It gives you a beautiful cotton mouth with such a great flavor. So it's a really great combo.
[03:59.000 --> 04:10.000]  Then it lasts super long because I'm putting that IFS diamond in there. I'm just pumping a lot of THC into my body all in one big hit. So it is a really great rush, a really great high.
[04:10.000 --> 04:24.000]  While I was talking about it, I was actually kind of building myself a dab. I usually don't dab on the podcast, but let's take a dab together on this episode. This is not going to be a grow lesson. In this episode, I plan to talk about my website.
[04:24.000 --> 04:37.000]  I plan to talk about iTunes and Stitcher and Google Play. And also we're going to read some iTunes customer reviews. Depending on how much time we've got after that, we may jump into some emails. We may just ramble a little bit.
[04:37.000 --> 04:52.000]  But in the meantime, let's take a dab together. I think I've got everything I need for a dab. I've got a rig, I've got a torch, I've got a fat dab prepared. Here is a carb cap. I'm going to do my best to take this dab and not bump the rig on the microphone and not do anything ridiculous like that.
[04:52.000 --> 05:05.000]  You may catch a couple of seconds of silence. I'm not sure what's going to happen when I start heating the nail with the torch. The torch may make the recording equipment go crazy. Let me adjust a knob here on the compressor. This may help us out just a little bit.
[05:05.000 --> 05:17.000]  All right, I'm going to heat the nail. I'm not sure what's going to happen when the torch comes on. Oh, it doesn't sound too bad in the headphones. I hope it doesn't sound like shit to you guys. I think if I keep talking, it will cut out the noise of that torch. So we only have to go for a few seconds.
[05:17.000 --> 05:39.000]  I hope you guys are taking a dab with me. I hope you guys are about to smoke something delicious. I hope you're hanging out with somebody beautiful. I hope you got a good day going on. I hope you're not stuck in a cubicle. But if you are, this dab is for you, my friend. I'm going to take a big old fat dab for you right now. I'm just heating up this nail nice and hot. Just letting it get hot, you guys. I know, be patient with me. We're going to take a dab together. It will all be worth it.
[05:39.000 --> 06:04.000]  Just cleaning it off a little bit while I do it. It still got a little crusty from the last dab I took. I feel like that's hot enough. All right, we'll hit a timer. We'll give it a countdown. And when we get to the right time, we will take a dab. I need to wait about 50 seconds with as much heat as I put on it. Usually, I could talk away for 50 seconds and it wouldn't feel like a big deal. But suddenly, since I have 50 seconds of time to cover, I don't have anything to say. Maybe this will work.
[06:04.000 --> 06:33.000]  If you guys would like to support the show on Patreon, I would truly appreciate that. You can do so by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart. All the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen. And I would appreciate your support. All right, that was almost 20 seconds worth of talking right there. That didn't take much time. But we're getting closer to dab time, you guys. I hope you're going to dab with me. Got a big old dab here, so we might go a little hotter than normal. A couple seconds. All right, let's take a dab, you guys. I'm going to move this mic out of my way and I'll take a dab.
[06:34.000 --> 07:28.380]  And we'll be right back. All right, that might have been more of a dab than I needed for a podcast. I feel like I am well medicated. My eyes are heavy. I've got some serious cotton mouth. My shoulders are nice and relaxed. I feel like we're going slow motion. I feel like maybe I should have brought a pillow for this part of the show. But I'm going to try to keep it moving. Let's see, what do we need to talk about? Let's jump right into it. The website. For a few days, my website was broken as shit. But guess what? Tony fixed it. Thank you, Tony.
[07:28.380 --> 07:55.380]  I appreciate it, bro. The website is back in action. You guys, if you're trying to visit the website, if you're trying to visit the store, those things are back in action. You can now check out the website, ireegeneticscolorado.com. You can also check out the IRE store while you're there. You can grab yourself a t-shirt or a hoodie. There are IRE Genetics t-shirts and hoodies available. There are also Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts and hoodies and the brand new IRE Army t-shirt, plus a nice line of stickers.
[07:55.380 --> 08:07.380]  So if you're trying to visit the store, if you're trying to do some Black Friday shopping or some Christmas shopping, I apologize that the website was down over that holiday, but it is fixed and it is back in action. Go take a look.
[08:07.380 --> 08:20.380]  And since the website is fixed, that means that Stitcher and iTunes are fixed. If you were missing the show on iTunes and or Stitcher, now all of the episodes are uploading properly. You are able to go listen on your favorite service.
[08:21.380 --> 08:38.380]  Also, I added the podcast to Google Play. I'm trying to get the podcast out there as much as I can, and I thought throwing it in Google Play would be beneficial. Google Play gives me a lot of good analytics, so I'll be able to watch that over the next month and we'll see how many people listen over Google Play.
[08:38.380 --> 08:49.380]  Also, don't forget that the podcast is always forever available on YouTube. Every single episode is available on the YouTube channel. You can find it by searching for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on YouTube.
[08:49.380 --> 08:58.380]  All right, I feel like that is most of the important business that I need to cover at the start of the show. Let's get into some iTunes customer reviews.
[08:59.380 --> 09:13.380]  These reviews come from the iTunes Store. If you are listening on an iPad or an iPhone and you would like to leave a review, it is very easy. Open up the podcast app, find the Grow From Your Heart podcast, go to the current episodes and keep scrolling.
[09:13.380 --> 09:31.380]  Scroll right past the current episodes. Then it will show you the best of the podcast. Then you will see ratings and reviews. There's a button that says, write a review. Simply click on that button. Then it will give you the option to give me a rating of one through five stars. Give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[09:31.380 --> 09:41.380]  Once you've clicked the appropriate amount of stars, you can type in your customer review. Let me know what you think about the show and I will read your review on a future episode.
[09:42.380 --> 09:54.380]  All right, Podcast World, let's jump into some of these most recent customer reviews. This one was left on November 11th by a guy who calls himself Tall Clint. Tall Clint gave us five stars. He says,
[09:54.380 --> 10:14.380]  I enjoy the show and I'm glad that I've turned my friends in the cannabis and hemp industries onto it. Keep up the great work. Then he signed it from Clint. Hey, Clint, thanks for listening to the show. Thanks for the great review. Also, thanks for turning your friends onto my podcast. I do appreciate it. Word of mouth is a great way to spread a podcast.
[10:14.380 --> 10:24.380]  You guys, we know who Clint is. Clint has been on the show before. Clint is my bro. So big thanks to Clint for all of the support. We may put Clint back on the podcast here in the very near future.
[10:24.380 --> 10:40.380]  All right, this next customer review was left on October 1st and it was left by a person who calls themselves Happy Atheist. The headline is, Most Knowledgeable Marijuana Podcast Out There. Then they gave us five stars. The review goes like this.
[10:40.380 --> 10:56.380]  I stumbled upon this podcast a couple of weeks ago and I listen to past episodes every day. Rasta Jeff is extremely knowledgeable about the topics he discusses. I always get a ton of helpful info and a good laugh while listening to him talk. Keep up the great work.
[10:56.380 --> 11:19.380]  Hey, Happy Atheist. Thank you for listening to the show. Thank you for the great review and thank you for all of the support. I hope you share the show like Clint did. And then I like that you said Rasta Jeff is extremely knowledgeable about the topics. Thank you. I try to do a little bit of research before I go on. I try to know what I'm talking about. And if I don't know a topic, I am happier just saying I don't know than trying to fake my way through it and teaching you some bullshit.
[11:20.380 --> 11:41.380]  So thanks for noticing that I am extremely knowledgeable about the topics I choose. And also you said that you get a good laugh out of listening to me. That means a lot because I think it's much easier to learn when you can laugh and have fun. When I went to school, I was not a very good student. I had a couple of teachers that actually went out of their way to educate me. They realized that I was a smart kid. I just didn't like learning the way most other kids learn.
[11:41.380 --> 12:10.380]  So I had a few teachers that did step out of their comfort zone and actually educate me. But most of the time, it just felt like I was being force fed some information so that I could pass a test to make the teachers look good. They weren't really teaching me anything that I needed to learn. So I'm here teaching something. I know how I hated learning. I hated being force fed information in a condescending tone. So I feel like if we laugh and if we have a good time and if we appreciate each other, I think you guys really learn a lot. That's why I kind of, I feel like I repeat myself and I reiterate things sometimes.
[12:11.380 --> 12:39.380]  People learn in different ways. Sometimes I can say the same thing three or four different ways. And the first three times I said it, a certain person may not get it. But on that fourth time, I may just word it just in a different order and it may all make sense to them. So that's why I kind of repeat myself a little bit. But also that's why I tell a few jokes. That's why I try to keep it fun. I'm not a super serious uptight guy when it comes to learning. I feel like we all can learn better if we can relax. You can let your guard down. You can smile a little bit. You want to learn more from your friends than some asshole preaching to you.
[12:41.380 --> 12:54.380]  So thank you for noticing that I know what I'm talking about and I've taken some time to actually understand what I'm trying to teach you. And also thank you for noticing that I'm trying to have a good time and keep it fun while educating all of my friends.
[12:54.380 --> 13:19.380]  All right. This next iTunes customer review comes from a person who calls themselves DaddyO45. The headline of the review says, Love the show. Of course, they gave us a five-star rating. They left this review on September 30th. And the review goes like this. Your show hits my ear just right. I love the tone and flow of the show. I always learn something. Keep up the good work.
[13:19.380 --> 13:46.380]  Hey, that is a great review. That is perfect. I'm glad the show hits your ear just right. Being a musician, being kind of an audiophile, that means a lot to me. Just those few words in a row right there. Your show hits my ear just right. That means I've got all the knobs dialed in. That means I've got all the equipment just right. That means a lot to me because I spent a lot of time dialing in the sound and making sure that it sounds great. I can't listen to a podcast with poor quality. So thank you. You're already starting off with a great review.
[13:46.380 --> 14:02.380]  Then you love the tone and flow of the show. Thank you. Like I said earlier, I'm trying to have fun while educating and keeping it real. So I'm glad you are always learning something. And dude, trust me, I will keep up the good work as long as you guys keep listening. So thank you for the great review, DaddyO45.
[14:02.380 --> 14:30.380]  Let's move into the next review. The headline of this one is Stay Irie. And they gave us five stars. This one comes from our friend Tommy. Tommy says, I couldn't be happier that I stumbled upon this podcast. The information is consistent. The material is new and engaging weekly. The personal touch he gives is top notch. The key to learning is being able to relate. With your vivid descriptions and examples, we are all able to relate.
[14:30.380 --> 14:35.380]  You are helping to eradicate the stigma surrounding cannabis. Walk good.
[14:35.380 --> 14:46.380]  Man, that is a great review. That means a lot to me. That tells me that I am hitting my goal. One of my goals when I started this show was to help eradicate the stigma around cannabis.
[14:46.380 --> 15:13.380]  Back in the day, part of the intro used to say, if you're a new smoker, if you're a new grower, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, I said that because I want everybody to relate to this show. I want you as a professional grower or you as a heavy consumer to be able to listen to this podcast with your mom or your grandma and say, hey, listen, this guy is fairly intelligent. He speaks fairly well. And he smokes a ton of cannabis and listen to the things he says.
[15:13.380 --> 15:41.380]  He's representing this plant in a positive light and he's taking the fear out of it. That was part of my mission when I started. So thank you. That is huge. Let's see. The information is consistent. Yes, I try to be consistent. I bragged a while back that I have not missed a Monday in five years. There was a technical glitch in the website. So I did technically miss a Monday, but I had a recorded episode. It was posted. It just would not make it to the internet. So I had an episode. It was on YouTube. So I'm going to say I didn't miss a Monday. But I try to be consistent.
[15:41.380 --> 16:05.380]  I think consistency is key when it comes to podcasting and developing an audience. The material is new and engaging. Yes, there is a lot of information to talk about when it comes to growing. I will never run out of growing info. So I will always have new and engaging material. Thank you for noticing that. The personal touch just comes naturally. I have a good time wherever I am, whatever I'm doing. So you're always going to get a little bit of Rasta Jeff flavor, no matter what I'm doing.
[16:05.380 --> 16:34.380]  If I'm doing a podcast, if I'm doing a YouTube video, if I'm doing a seminar, if I'm doing some consulting, you always get a little bit of Rasta Jeff personality in that. That's just how it goes when you're working with me. So I'm glad you enjoy it. I'm glad you appreciate it. And I'm glad we're kind of connecting. It feels like I'm making friends through the podcast. When I meet you guys at events and things, you'll walk up to me and you'll say, Hey, I'm T-Homie or Tommy, however I'm supposed to say it. I think it's Tommy. You'll say, Hey, I'm Tommy. And I'll be like, Oh, dude, I almost know who you are. It feels like we've been hanging out because we've corresponded so much through messages and I've read your reviews.
[16:35.380 --> 17:04.380]  And you know so much about me because I spill it all out right here on the show. So it feels like we've already broken the ice and we can just hang out when we meet each other. So that's a lot of fun. I'm glad we're connecting on that sort of level. I'm glad we're able to relate, which is the next word that you use in your review here. So I'm glad we're able to do that. Then you go on to say that my vivid descriptions and examples make it easy for everyone to relate. Thank you. That means a lot to me. I am obviously hitting my goal. I'm starting to see a theme here in these reviews. These reviews tell me that I am hitting my goal.
[17:04.380 --> 17:33.380]  You guys are able to relate with me. You're having fun and you are learning and we are dispelling the stigma around cannabis. So this is a good time. I'm hitting my goal. This means a lot to me. Thank you guys for all the support. Hey, Tommy, thank you for the great review. My friend. I've got one more iTunes customer review and it comes from a person who calls themselves IDead420. The headline of the review is great show. Of course, they left five stars. They left this review on September 19th and the review is short and sweet and it goes like this.
[17:34.380 --> 17:55.380]  Best cannabis podcast I have listened to. That's awesome. Thank you. I'm glad you used the word cannabis. That makes me happy. And you said best. I'm not out for any sort of competition or anything, but if you feel it's the best, that makes me proud and that makes me happy. So thank you. Thank you for listening. Thank you for the support and thank you for the great review.
[17:55.380 --> 18:24.380]  You guys, I want to thank everybody for the great iTunes customer review. If you want to leave a review, again, it's really easy.

[18:25.380 --> 18:39.380]  One sourpuss gave me a one star and another slightly less sourpuss gave me a two star review. So, so far we're doing really well in the ratings department. Thanks again to everybody who has left an iTunes customer review and a five star rating.
[18:40.380 --> 19:02.380]  All right, podcast world. I'm going to start wrapping up this episode. I know this was a little bit short, but it is a Thursday bonus episode. I have been putting out a lot of content lately. I've also been fighting off this little head cold in the throat thing. I'm not going to push my voice too hard today. I wanted to get these iTunes customer reviews out. I'm going out of town for a couple of days, so I wanted to get a nice, sweet Thursday episode ready for you guys.
[19:03.380 --> 19:19.380]  Before I go, I just want to remind you guys, it gets rough out there in the holiday season. Just be nice to one another. Don't forget that even though you're busy and it's cold and life is hard, you still got to be fucking nice to each other. Don't forget, simple shit goes a long way, especially around this time of year.
[19:19.380 --> 19:36.380]  That's all I've got for you. I would appreciate it if you follow me on the social media. Of course, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
