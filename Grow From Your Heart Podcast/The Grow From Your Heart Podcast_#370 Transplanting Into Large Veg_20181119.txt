[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.240 --> 00:05.840]  It's time for episode 370 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.840 --> 00:09.040]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.040 --> 00:13.920]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.920 --> 00:20.000]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.660]  You know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I've been smoking.
[00:23.660 --> 00:27.840]  Today I've been taking dabs of strawberry diesel ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:27.840 --> 00:29.040]  Farms.
[00:29.080 --> 00:33.520]  This stuff smells like skunky strawberries and just funky fruit.
[00:33.520 --> 00:37.680]  And if you dab it at a nice low temperature, it tastes like strawberries and cream with
[00:37.680 --> 00:40.560]  a hint of skunky gassiness in the background.
[00:40.560 --> 00:41.560]  It is very delicious.
[00:41.560 --> 00:45.200]  It's almost like eating some strawberry shortcake at the gas station.
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.980]  That's what it kind of smells like to me.
[00:46.980 --> 00:54.960]  The lab test on the front here says 72.3% THC with a total cannabinoid content of 83.9%.
[00:54.960 --> 00:56.400]  I really like this concentrate.
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.640]  It tastes delicious.
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.240]  The high is great and the texture and consistency are beautiful.
[01:01.240 --> 01:05.080]  There's just enough terp sauce in here and it's got some nice chunky crystals.
[01:05.080 --> 01:07.200]  I am really happy with that purchase.
[01:07.200 --> 01:09.960]  Great concentrate from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:09.960 --> 01:13.560]  All right, my next order of business is to give a couple of people some shout outs.
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.520]  I want to give a huge shout out to Brett Gorman.
[01:15.520 --> 01:18.040]  How about a giant shout out to Riley Hanson?
[01:18.040 --> 01:19.840]  A big shout out to Mike O'Panther.
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.640]  A big thank you shout out to Sam.
[01:21.640 --> 01:24.880]  And also a giant fist bump and a shout out to Aldridge.
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.200]  Thank you guys for the continued Patreon support.
[01:27.800 --> 01:30.800]  All right, Podcast World, this is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.240]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.920]  That series starts at episode 351.
[01:37.920 --> 01:41.640]  In this series of lessons, we started by setting a goal for our grow.
[01:41.640 --> 01:43.800]  Then we decided a good place for our grow.
[01:43.800 --> 01:47.120]  Then we acquired the appropriate equipment and set it up.
[01:47.120 --> 01:51.000]  Then we either acquired seeds or clones and we got those growing.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.880]  At this point in my grow lessons, we should have small plants that are approximately 8
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.560]  to 12 inches tall and they are in small pots.
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.520]  They are probably in either beer cups or 4-inch pots or maybe 6 or 8-inch net pots.
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.240]  But we've got small plants.
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.880]  They should be nice and healthy at this point.
[02:06.880 --> 02:09.320]  They should have nice branching coming out of them.
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.600]  They should not have any bugs or any powdery mildew.
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.400]  Hopefully at this point, we don't have any burned leaves or any signs of deficiencies.
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.640]  Hopefully we have got a nice, developed, thriving root system to work with.
[02:22.640 --> 02:25.600]  Now if most of those things are accurate, we've got a nice, healthy plant.
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.440]  It is growing, it's branching, it looks healthy, it's thriving, it's not struggling, and we've
[02:29.440 --> 02:31.400]  got a nice, healthy root system.
[02:31.400 --> 02:36.080]  It is time to transplant our small plants into our larger pot, our finishing pot, and
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.960]  start the large veg phase.
[02:37.960 --> 02:41.560]  Now these plants will probably finish out in these pots unless you want to transplant
[02:41.560 --> 02:43.880]  one more time into an even larger pot.
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.080]  I like to go from the small pot into my finishing pot.
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.760]  I'm generally going to go into a 3-gallon or a 5-gallon or a 7-gallon in an indoor garden.
[02:52.760 --> 02:54.520]  You guys may choose to go larger.
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.520]  You may want to go from the small 6-inch net pot maybe to a 1-gallon, then maybe into your
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.880]  20 or 30-gallon if you're going to do something like that.
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.240]  I talked in a previous episode about why it's a good idea to use a smaller container for
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.440]  smaller plants.
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.920]  We don't need to water this giant area when we've got a tiny plant right in the middle.
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.120]  So if you're going to go to a 20 or 30-gallon pot, you may want to go from the cup to maybe
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.160]  a 1-gallon, maybe a 3-gallon, then later on transplant that into your 20 or 30.
[03:22.200 --> 03:24.800]  But it gets challenging when you go to transplant larger plants.
[03:24.800 --> 03:27.120]  If you're not experienced with it, you can cause damage.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.360]  You need to lay that larger plant on its side.
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.360]  You need to remove that pot.
[03:30.360 --> 03:32.800]  Then you need to pot a much larger plant.
[03:32.800 --> 03:35.880]  It does get difficult, but I have faith in you that you can do it.
[03:35.880 --> 03:38.720]  If you choose to transplant twice, just be careful.
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.520]  In this lesson, we're going to focus on transplanting one time.
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.640]  We're going to go from this small beer cup or our 4-inch or our 6-inch net pot or maybe
[03:45.640 --> 03:51.400]  an 8-inch pot, and we're going to pot into a 3- or a 5- or a 7-gallon pot for my example.
[03:51.640 --> 03:54.800]  Alright, let's talk a little bit about pots and soil.
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.960]  I did a long episode about choosing pots and soil, but let's do a brief recap.
[03:59.960 --> 04:03.760]  I like to use the plastic nursery pots in a home grow.
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.800]  In a commercial facility, I like to use a root pot, one of the fabric pots.
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.420]  In most applications, I am using a 3-gallon pot.
[04:12.420 --> 04:16.680]  You can use whatever kind of pots make you happy as long as it's going to get you to
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.120]  your goal.
[04:18.120 --> 04:22.840]  The thing I find most important is to make sure that whatever container you use, that
[04:22.840 --> 04:25.640]  it has plenty of holes for drainage.
[04:25.640 --> 04:30.040]  Make sure that when you water this plant, the excess water has some way to escape from
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.920]  the bottom of that pot.
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.640]  The nursery pots have plenty of holes in them already.
[04:34.640 --> 04:38.080]  The fabric pots will drain naturally just because they're mesh.
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.360]  Those work perfectly.
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.440]  If you're going to use a Home Depot bucket or something like that, make sure you drill
[04:43.440 --> 04:46.480]  plenty of drainage holes in your container.
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.680]  Now let's talk briefly about soil or soilless mix.
[04:49.680 --> 04:52.680]  You don't have to buy a really expensive soil.
[04:52.680 --> 04:58.800]  If you're going to feed your plants with bottled nutrients, you can buy an inert medium.
[04:58.800 --> 05:04.600]  You don't need a soil or soilless mix with a lot of nutrients and a lot of stuff in there.
[05:04.600 --> 05:08.520]  You're going to be on top of fertilizing these plants with your bottled nutrients, so we
[05:08.520 --> 05:12.640]  don't need to pay extra money for a soil or a soilless mix that's got a bunch of stuff
[05:12.640 --> 05:13.640]  in there.
[05:13.640 --> 05:16.600]  If you're going to give us the opportunity to burn our plants because we're going to
[05:16.600 --> 05:20.880]  add them to a soil that's got nutrients in it, then we're going to add bottled nutrients
[05:20.880 --> 05:22.120]  on top of that.
[05:22.120 --> 05:26.240]  We do run the risk of over fertilizing the plants in that situation.
[05:26.240 --> 05:29.680]  We don't really need an over fertilized soil or soilless mix.
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.760]  We need something more inert, maybe something with some mycos or some beneficial fungus
[05:33.760 --> 05:34.760]  in there.
[05:34.760 --> 05:38.800]  That would be advantageous, but we don't really need a lot of nutrients.
[05:38.800 --> 05:43.120]  Whatever medium you choose to purchase, I recommend you get something with a lot of
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.160]  aeration in it, either a lot of perlite or a lot of persolite.
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.440]  If it doesn't come with plenty of aeration product already in it, buy a bag of perlite
[05:52.440 --> 05:54.320]  and amend it yourself.
[05:54.320 --> 05:58.480]  The amount of perlite or persolite you're going to need to add to your soil or soilless
[05:58.480 --> 06:04.120]  mix will depend on the fluffiness and the amount of aeration in that medium when you
[06:04.120 --> 06:05.120]  purchase it.
[06:05.120 --> 06:08.720]  I'm not sure what you're going to purchase, so I'm not sure what to recommend as a ratio
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.120]  of how much perlite.
[06:10.120 --> 06:11.760]  I like it fluffy.
[06:11.760 --> 06:18.620]  When I'm working with cocoa, I mix three bags of cocoa and one five-gallon bucket of perlite
[06:18.620 --> 06:21.840]  and one five-gallon bucket of persolite.
[06:21.840 --> 06:26.780]  That gives me about 25 to 30 three-gallon pots worth of material to work with.
[06:26.780 --> 06:30.360]  You guys can reduce that recipe as needed for your garden.
[06:30.360 --> 06:34.520]  If I were working with soil or a soilless mix, I might not use as much perlite.
[06:34.520 --> 06:38.200]  I may reduce that perlite by about half.
[06:38.200 --> 06:44.160]  In my opinion, I don't need as much aeration in soil and soilless mix as I do in the cocoa.
[06:44.160 --> 06:49.360]  I feel like the cocoa holds a lot more water, so it also pushes out a lot more air and it
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.000]  kind of crushes the plants a little more.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.560]  It gets heavier because it's got so much water in there.
[06:53.560 --> 06:57.880]  The soil and soilless mix doesn't hold as much water, so it doesn't get as heavy and
[06:57.880 --> 07:00.040]  it doesn't crush the roots as much.
[07:00.040 --> 07:01.500]  You don't need as much perlite.
[07:01.500 --> 07:02.980]  Maybe go half as much.
[07:02.980 --> 07:07.620]  Maybe if you're doing three bags of soil, do half of a five-gallon bucket of persolite
[07:07.620 --> 07:10.100]  and half of a five-gallon bucket of perlite.
[07:10.100 --> 07:13.380]  If you guys aren't going to buy the persolite, I understand it's more expensive.
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.540]  It's another product to buy.
[07:14.540 --> 07:16.860]  You will get by with just using perlite.
[07:16.860 --> 07:18.740]  Perlite is just fine for this situation.
[07:18.740 --> 07:21.780]  If you only want to buy the one product, that will be fine.
[07:21.780 --> 07:26.100]  Three bags of soil and maybe one bag of perlite for this application.
[07:26.100 --> 07:28.220]  I know I work in larger batches than a lot of people.
[07:28.220 --> 07:32.380]  If you want to reduce this recipe for a smaller garden, I think they sell the bags of soil
[07:32.780 --> 07:37.740]  in 1.75 cubic yards is what I think most of those bags of dirt are, or at least the bags
[07:37.740 --> 07:41.420]  of cocoa I was buying are 1.77 cubic yards.
[07:41.420 --> 07:49.260]  If you buy 1.77 cubic yards of dirt, mix that with a third of a five-gallon bucket of perlite.
[07:49.260 --> 07:52.980]  Just fill the bucket up about a third, maybe halfway if you want to go hard.
[07:52.980 --> 07:57.260]  Then mix that in really well with your soil so that it's nicely evenly mixed in there
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.860]  with everything else so that you just see the little white spots everywhere.
[08:00.860 --> 08:04.740]  Then you know you've got plenty of aeration throughout your entire root zone.
[08:04.740 --> 08:10.660]  Now while we're mixing up perlite into our soil, why not mix in some sort of root inoculant powder?
[08:10.660 --> 08:15.020]  In a previous episode, I talked all about mycorrhizal fungi.
[08:15.020 --> 08:21.260]  Let's add a mycorrhizal product to our mix right now and get it distributed all throughout the soil.
[08:21.260 --> 08:24.220]  Something like the Great White Granulars would work perfectly.
[08:24.220 --> 08:26.380]  You can use Great White Shark on its own.
[08:26.380 --> 08:27.820]  Just sprinkle it in there right now.
[08:27.820 --> 08:30.420]  You can use Plus Life right now.
[08:30.460 --> 08:34.980]  Any sort of powdered mycoproduct would work wonderfully right now.
[08:34.980 --> 08:37.580]  Sprinkle it right into the dirt as you're mixing it up.
[08:37.580 --> 08:43.340]  So I feel like that's a great way to segue into actually starting to do the transplanting process.
[08:43.340 --> 08:44.460]  We've got healthy plants.
[08:44.460 --> 08:45.780]  We've got a container.
[08:45.780 --> 08:48.140]  We've got a good soil or soilless mix.
[08:48.140 --> 08:49.380]  It's well aerated.
[08:49.380 --> 08:51.540]  We've put a mycoproduct in there.
[08:51.540 --> 08:53.660]  Now let's actually get to work.
[08:53.660 --> 08:58.020]  Step number one, you guys, is always find the Bluetooth speaker and put on the Grow
[08:58.020 --> 08:59.660]  From Your Heart podcast.
[08:59.700 --> 09:00.700]  It helps you grow.
[09:00.700 --> 09:05.100]  It makes the plants happy, and it puts you in a good mood to create a positive garden
[09:05.100 --> 09:06.100]  environment.
[09:06.100 --> 09:09.340]  So step number one, find the Bluetooth speaker or find your earbuds.
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.700]  Get your earbuds in.
[09:10.700 --> 09:13.020]  Get hooked up with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[09:13.020 --> 09:17.260]  That is going to make your garden grow so much more rapidly.
[09:17.260 --> 09:18.940]  It's going to make you grow more rapidly.
[09:18.940 --> 09:20.180]  It's going to make everything go better.
[09:20.180 --> 09:23.500]  So step number one, find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[09:23.500 --> 09:26.100]  Get it at an acceptable volume and get that going in the growth.
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.580]  Step number two, get some rubber gloves.
[09:28.580 --> 09:30.700]  I often overlook this step.
[09:30.700 --> 09:32.680]  We should always be wearing gloves.
[09:32.680 --> 09:36.620]  If we're coming in contact with the mycos, if we're coming in contact with the roots,
[09:36.620 --> 09:40.300]  if we're coming in contact with bottled nutrients, we should be wearing gloves.
[09:40.300 --> 09:45.100]  Also, if you're going to be sprinkling those mycoproducts over your topsoil just all willy-nilly,
[09:45.100 --> 09:47.540]  maybe you might want to consider some sort of a mask.
[09:47.540 --> 09:50.820]  We don't really want to breathe in microbe products.
[09:50.820 --> 09:52.220]  So we've got the podcast on.
[09:52.220 --> 09:53.220]  We're gloved up.
[09:53.220 --> 09:54.220]  We've got a face mask on.
[09:54.220 --> 09:55.700]  You've got your dreadlocks tied up.
[09:55.820 --> 09:59.380]  Hopefully you're nicely medicated if that's appropriate wherever you work or wherever
[09:59.380 --> 10:00.380]  you're growing.
[10:00.380 --> 10:02.420]  Now let's actually get to business here.
[10:02.420 --> 10:05.960]  We need to fill our container, whatever size container we chose.
[10:05.960 --> 10:08.880]  We need to fill it with our well-mixed medium.
[10:08.880 --> 10:09.960]  We've got our soilless mix.
[10:09.960 --> 10:11.500]  We've got our cocoa.
[10:11.500 --> 10:13.540]  Hopefully we've got a bunch of perlite in there.
[10:13.540 --> 10:15.520]  Hopefully we added a mycoproduct to there.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.520]  We've got it all mixed up.
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.740]  Now it's ready to go into a container.
[10:18.740 --> 10:23.340]  I like to fill my containers by using a smaller container just to scoop dirt out of the bag
[10:23.340 --> 10:27.580]  or whatever container it's in and just dump it right into the pot that it's going into.
[10:27.580 --> 10:28.700]  Just fill it up.
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.320]  Fill it up most of the way.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.740]  If you're filling up a three gallon, five gallon, or seven gallon pot, fill it up most
[10:33.740 --> 10:39.340]  of the way, but leave yourself about an inch and a half or maybe two inches at the top
[10:39.340 --> 10:42.900]  where you don't fill it all the way up, all the way to the brim.
[10:42.900 --> 10:46.900]  Leave yourself about inch and a half, two inches so that when we water, we've got some
[10:46.900 --> 10:48.900]  room to put water in the pot.
[10:48.900 --> 10:52.120]  You don't want to pour water on the pot and watch it run right off the top.
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.240]  You don't want to have to stand there and pour water really slowly to where you can
[10:55.240 --> 10:59.880]  get that whole quarter or half or gallon of water into the pot so you can water it appropriately.
[10:59.880 --> 11:03.540]  I like to be able to just splash a gallon of water on top of a seven gallon pot and
[11:03.540 --> 11:05.760]  just watch it saturate that whole top area.
[11:05.760 --> 11:08.460]  Then you can just walk away and do the next pot.
[11:08.460 --> 11:11.880]  If you fill it up too far, you got to just stand there and pour it slowly to where the
[11:11.880 --> 11:14.600]  water saturates into the medium and drains down a little bit.
[11:14.600 --> 11:16.840]  Then you can pour a little more.
[11:16.840 --> 11:17.840]  Leave yourself some space.
[11:17.840 --> 11:21.500]  Also, in the future, we may choose to top dress these plants.
[11:21.500 --> 11:23.320]  You may want to add some worm castings.
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.180]  You may want to add some bat guano.
[11:25.180 --> 11:30.000]  You may just add some fresh soil with some charged up nutrients in it to the top layer.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.840]  Leave yourselves some room so that you've got options and you've got watering space.
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.660]  As you are filling your container, pack your medium in there slightly tight.
[11:38.660 --> 11:42.200]  You don't want it packed real snug, but you don't want it fluffy and loose.
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.700]  We want to make the roots work to dig down into the dirt and have some more to grow and
[11:46.700 --> 11:49.020]  do a little exercise to get in there.
[11:49.020 --> 11:52.640]  We also don't want to suffocate them and make it so hard that the roots simply can't
[11:52.640 --> 11:54.300]  grow into the medium.
[11:54.300 --> 11:58.440]  You have to pack it a little bit, but don't crush it so tight to where the roots can't
[11:58.440 --> 11:59.440]  even grow.
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.620]  Now, if you packed it too loosely, you will notice on the first couple of waterings, you'll
[12:03.620 --> 12:05.300]  just get a giant hole in the center.
[12:05.300 --> 12:06.300]  All the dirt will just cave in.
[12:06.300 --> 12:09.300]  You'll create a hole in the middle, and then you'll have to repack it, put more dirt in
[12:09.300 --> 12:10.780]  there, then rewater it.
[12:10.780 --> 12:11.780]  That's okay.
[12:11.780 --> 12:12.780]  You didn't mess up.
[12:12.780 --> 12:14.960]  You just should have gone a little harder in the first place.
[12:14.960 --> 12:15.980]  You will learn.
[12:15.980 --> 12:18.440]  If you go too hard, the roots just aren't going to grow.
[12:18.440 --> 12:21.920]  If you go too soft, the water's just going to fall right through, and you will definitely
[12:21.920 --> 12:23.600]  get indicators.
[12:23.600 --> 12:24.640]  Fill your container.
[12:24.640 --> 12:26.040]  Pack it slightly tight.
[12:26.040 --> 12:28.800]  I usually just use the palm of my hand, and I give it just a few pats.
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.280]  I throw in just a few scoops of dirt just to give myself a few inches of dirt, and then
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.160]  I just pat it in, and then I throw in some more dirt, and then I just pat it in.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.600]  You can hear me just tapping on the table here.
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.600]  It's not that hard.
[12:37.600 --> 12:40.600]  I'm just patting it down, just getting the dirt nice and even in there.
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.080]  Then I just pour more dirt on top of it, just pat it down.
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.600]  I'd rather pour some in and then pack it down and then pour some in and pack it down instead
[12:46.600 --> 12:48.560]  of fill it up and then try to pack all that down.
[12:48.560 --> 12:53.400]  I feel like that's not really as productive as packing each little layer.
[12:53.400 --> 12:56.160]  Pour some dirt in there, pack it down, pour some dirt, pack it down.
[12:56.160 --> 12:59.600]  Get yourself up to about an inch and a half or two inches to the top.
[12:59.600 --> 13:01.560]  Now here's where it gets fun.
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.400]  We have got our three, our five, or seven gallon pot filled with our appropriate mix,
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.360]  and it is leveled off, and we've got about an inch and a half or two inches of space
[13:10.360 --> 13:13.640]  so that we can add water or top dress later in the future.
[13:13.680 --> 13:19.160]  Now in the very center of that pot, we need to create a space for our transplanted plant.
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.760]  We need to create a little hole in which to place our small root ball.
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.120]  The way I like to do it is find the middle of that topsoil and just dig out about a fist
[13:28.120 --> 13:29.560]  size worth of dirt.
[13:29.560 --> 13:30.560]  Just take out about just a fist.
[13:30.560 --> 13:33.800]  I've got a pretty big fist, so just take out about a fist size worth of dirt right in the
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.560]  center of that topsoil.
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.000]  Then whatever size pot my plant is already in, say I'm in a beer cup or maybe I'm in
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.800]  a six inch net pot, I will take a beer cup or a six inch net pot and I will dig a hole
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.440]  in my new potsoil right at the top, right in the center, and I will actually plant the
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.600]  cup in that hole.
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.880]  I will dig a hole perfectly to where that cup will fit, then I will backfill dirt around
[13:57.880 --> 14:00.440]  that cup, kind of snug.
[14:00.440 --> 14:04.800]  Then I will pull the cup or the six inch net pot out of that made hole.
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.160]  Now I have got a perfect template that is the exact shape of the incoming root ball
[14:10.320 --> 14:12.040]  from my small veg plant.
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.040]  So I basically leveled off the dirt, I dug out a hole, I put the previous pot in that
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.840]  hole, I backfilled it, then I just pulled that pot right out so I made an impression,
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.080]  a template, just a little gap for the next plant to fit perfectly into.
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.000]  So you've got a top layer of soil with this little round hole perfectly waiting, just
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.920]  chilling, waiting for a pot to go in it.
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.240]  Now our next step is to pot our small veg plant into that hole.
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.800]  But before we do that, you know what I'm going to recommend?
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.120]  Let's sprinkle a little mycopowder right into that hole.
[14:43.120 --> 14:45.980]  Our fresh exposed roots are going to go right there.
[14:45.980 --> 14:48.160]  Let's just sprinkle some mycopowder right there.
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.240]  Let's just give it some love, give it a boost, give it a head start.
[14:51.240 --> 14:53.580]  That's just like laying out some cookies for Santa.
[14:53.580 --> 14:54.680]  Just get it nice and ready.
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.440]  Put some mycopowder right in the hole.
[14:56.440 --> 15:02.440]  Now our next challenge will be to get the small plant out of that small pot.
[15:02.800 --> 15:08.040]  Hopefully it has grown really tight into your beer cup or really tight into your six inch net pot.
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.320]  It is nicely root bound.
[15:09.320 --> 15:11.800]  There's a lot of root mass in that container.
[15:11.800 --> 15:14.480]  So it's going to take a little effort to get it out.
[15:14.480 --> 15:18.080]  The way I do it is I make a Spock hand.
[15:18.080 --> 15:20.720]  I've got my first finger and my middle finger together.
[15:20.720 --> 15:23.320]  I've got my ring finger and my pinky finger together.
[15:23.320 --> 15:29.240]  I place the stick of the plant between my middle finger and my ring finger, sticking
[15:29.240 --> 15:31.900]  up the root ball.
[15:31.900 --> 15:33.760]  The soil is in my palm.
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.260]  Then I flip it upside down.
[15:35.260 --> 15:39.860]  So now the plant is hanging upside down and I'm holding on to the root ball with my Spock hand.
[15:39.860 --> 15:43.300]  I do that in my left hand because I don't need as much coordination.
[15:43.300 --> 15:44.300]  It can just stay there.
[15:44.300 --> 15:50.620]  Then I take my right hand and I kind of just squeeze the beer cup or the six inch net pot.
[15:50.620 --> 15:52.220]  Just squeeze it all around.
[15:52.220 --> 15:53.800]  Just squeeze it.
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.420]  If you've ever rolled a joint too tight and you're trying to loosen the joint, it's the same idea.
[15:57.420 --> 15:59.920]  We're just trying to loosen the dirt out of that cup.
[15:59.920 --> 16:01.780]  So just squeeze all around it.
[16:01.860 --> 16:02.860]  Squeeze it.
[16:02.860 --> 16:03.860]  It's all you really got to do.
[16:03.860 --> 16:04.860]  You'll feel it loosening up.
[16:04.860 --> 16:07.460]  Maybe squeeze it and work it to the left and right just a little bit.
[16:07.460 --> 16:10.260]  You'll feel how to loosen the dirt inside of that pot once you start doing it.
[16:10.260 --> 16:13.060]  All you're trying to do is loosen the dirt so that it will fall out.
[16:13.060 --> 16:14.740]  Give it a little shake and it's going to fall out.
[16:14.740 --> 16:18.440]  You're going to have an exposed root zone in your hand now.
[16:18.440 --> 16:19.900]  It's okay.
[16:19.900 --> 16:22.900]  Hopefully when it came out, it all stayed together in one big chunk.
[16:22.900 --> 16:24.000]  Hopefully you've taken good care of it.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.400]  You've properly watered it.
[16:25.400 --> 16:28.840]  You've given it proper dry time and the roots have developed nice and fat in there.
[16:28.840 --> 16:30.460]  So it's all just one chunk.
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.460]  If it came out as a mess, that's okay.
[16:32.460 --> 16:35.700]  We're just going to pot that whole mess into that hole that we already made and it will
[16:35.700 --> 16:37.940]  be just fine.
[16:37.940 --> 16:43.740]  Once you get the root ball out of the container, you already know what I'm going to say.
[16:43.740 --> 16:45.340]  Sprinkle a little mycos on it.
[16:45.340 --> 16:46.340]  Why not?
[16:46.340 --> 16:47.500]  We've got exposed roots.
[16:47.500 --> 16:48.900]  Those roots love mycos.
[16:48.900 --> 16:51.480]  Those mycos are activated by touching roots.
[16:51.480 --> 16:52.580]  Sprinkle them on there.
[16:52.580 --> 16:56.020]  Give it as much myco powder as you can afford to sprinkle on there at this time.
[16:56.020 --> 16:57.220]  Just give it a nice little coating.
[16:57.220 --> 16:59.980]  Just infect it with root inoculant powder.
[17:00.500 --> 17:05.220]  If it came out in a mess, you need to gently place it in that hole.
[17:05.220 --> 17:08.380]  Get as much of that original dirt as you can in there.
[17:08.380 --> 17:09.380]  Set the root ball down.
[17:09.380 --> 17:14.020]  Put some ... So maybe put the ... If they're dangling long roots, set the dangly roots
[17:14.020 --> 17:15.020]  in there.
[17:15.020 --> 17:16.020]  Put a little dirt on top of it.
[17:16.020 --> 17:17.420]  Lower the plant in a little more.
[17:17.420 --> 17:18.420]  Put some dirt on top of it.
[17:18.420 --> 17:21.540]  Lower it in a little bit more so that you don't bind those roots up.
[17:21.540 --> 17:23.100]  We're trying to give those roots space.
[17:23.100 --> 17:26.940]  We don't want to just drop them right in there and smother them with fresh dirt.
[17:26.980 --> 17:30.620]  If they came apart, keep them apart when you're putting them in there.
[17:30.620 --> 17:33.140]  Then backfill it with all the dirt from that container.
[17:33.140 --> 17:35.800]  You should have enough dirt there to level everything off.
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.140]  If you lost some dirt during the movement, just grab some more dirt out of your mix and
[17:40.140 --> 17:42.500]  just top it to where you have a nice even layer.
[17:42.500 --> 17:43.500]  Kind of pack it in.
[17:43.500 --> 17:44.500]  Not super tight.
[17:44.500 --> 17:47.820]  Just tight enough to keep that plant staying straight upright.
[17:47.820 --> 17:52.220]  Now if it came out nice and smooth ... Now we've got another option.
[17:52.220 --> 17:56.980]  If it came out nice and smooth and you feel like those roots are perfect and they aren't
[17:56.980 --> 18:01.420]  super bound but they're growing well, you can just set still, sprinkle some icos on
[18:01.420 --> 18:02.420]  it.
[18:02.420 --> 18:05.880]  Then you can set that perfect root ball right into that perfect hole.
[18:05.880 --> 18:09.620]  Maybe sprinkle a little bit of dirt on top of it and pat it in and you've got a beautifully
[18:09.620 --> 18:14.660]  transplanted plant that didn't get any shock or any stress whatsoever during the transplanting
[18:14.660 --> 18:15.900]  process.
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.340]  Our other option, when you take it out of the small container, if it is really bound
[18:20.340 --> 18:25.140]  up in there, if you see a lot of white roots and it is growing in a circle and it's getting
[18:25.140 --> 18:30.100]  spiraled, you do have the option to kind of break those roots up just a little bit.
[18:30.100 --> 18:34.240]  The way I do it is I hold it with my left hand and I take my middle finger and my ring
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.460]  finger on my right hand and I come straight up from the bottom of that root ball and I
[18:38.460 --> 18:41.620]  just plow my fingers through it and just pull it apart.
[18:41.620 --> 18:43.100]  Just spread it right in half.
[18:43.100 --> 18:44.260]  You're going to tear some roots up.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.820]  You're going to mess some stuff up.
[18:45.820 --> 18:50.220]  If you've got a nice, healthy root system, that is only going to encourage growth.
[18:50.220 --> 18:52.140]  You're spreading it out a little bit.
[18:52.140 --> 18:55.460]  Then when you set it in that template hole that you've got, the roots will spread out
[18:55.460 --> 18:59.140]  a little bit and instead of growing in a perfect spiral, they're going to take off a little
[18:59.140 --> 19:01.700]  bit for you and fill that pot.
[19:01.700 --> 19:06.340]  Either way, sprinkle mycos on the roots on that root ball that you pull out of the pot.
[19:06.340 --> 19:07.900]  Sprinkle mycos on there.
[19:07.900 --> 19:10.260]  Always sprinkle some mycos into the hole.
[19:10.260 --> 19:14.820]  Then gently place that small root ball into that fresh hole and just cover it with dirt
[19:14.820 --> 19:15.820]  gently.
[19:15.820 --> 19:19.540]  Again, don't pack it down too tightly, but pack it down tight enough to where you know
[19:19.860 --> 19:23.300]  it's not going to cave in when we water it and that it's tight enough to give that plant
[19:23.300 --> 19:25.460]  enough support to stay upright.
[19:25.460 --> 19:29.620]  You will know on the first watering if you did not do it tightly enough.
[19:29.620 --> 19:33.820]  If you didn't do it tight enough, you're just going to need to add more medium.
[19:33.820 --> 19:35.740]  Now that plant is basically transplanted.
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.220]  I recommend you label that plant at this time before you forget.
[19:40.220 --> 19:43.860]  The next step is to move that plant under the appropriate light.
[19:43.860 --> 19:48.620]  I should also mention you may need a saucer or some sort of a catch tray underneath your
[19:48.700 --> 19:49.700]  plants.
[19:49.700 --> 19:51.700]  When we water these plants, we expect to have some runoff.
[19:51.700 --> 19:55.620]  Now is a good time to consider placing your plant on a saucer or some sort of a catch
[19:55.620 --> 19:56.620]  tray.
[19:56.620 --> 19:57.980]  We've got the trays down.
[19:57.980 --> 20:02.300]  Let's talk about the lighting in which we are going to place these plants under.
[20:02.300 --> 20:05.100]  You can use T5s for your fresh transplants.
[20:05.100 --> 20:07.640]  You can get the T5s really close.
[20:07.640 --> 20:12.080]  You can get those T5 lights three, maybe four inches away from your canopy.
[20:12.080 --> 20:16.060]  Just make sure that you adjust them every day because the plants are going to grow rapidly
[20:16.300 --> 20:19.860]  and they will grow into those lights if you don't pay attention.
[20:19.860 --> 20:23.540]  You can also use ceramic metal halide for your fresh transplants.
[20:23.540 --> 20:26.140]  I like the 315s or the 630s.
[20:26.140 --> 20:30.220]  You need to keep those a little bit further away than the T5s, probably about a foot,
[20:30.220 --> 20:32.140]  maybe 18 inches away.
[20:32.140 --> 20:36.860]  LEDs are very brand and power specific.
[20:36.860 --> 20:41.540]  I would follow the recommendation from the manufacturer on your LED.
[20:41.540 --> 20:46.040]  I don't have enough experience with your LED to know what it's going to do to the plants.
[20:46.040 --> 20:50.320]  There are so many vendors, so many different makes and models that it is hard to give
[20:50.320 --> 20:52.360]  advice for LED lighting.
[20:52.360 --> 20:57.580]  But you certainly can use LEDs through the entire cycle and you can absolutely use them
[20:57.580 --> 21:00.260]  right now for your fresh transplants.
[21:00.260 --> 21:05.520]  You can also use metal halide or high pressure sodium, also known as high intensity discharge
[21:05.520 --> 21:06.860]  lighting.
[21:06.860 --> 21:11.400]  If you are going to use high intensity discharge lighting, pay close attention to how the plants
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.660]  are reacting.
[21:12.660 --> 21:18.740]  If you're using a 400, you can probably get 12 to 18 inches away and not have any problems.
[21:18.740 --> 21:23.940]  If you were using a 600, you could probably get 18 inches away and not have any problems.
[21:23.940 --> 21:27.980]  If you're using a thousand watt light, you may want to start off about two feet away
[21:27.980 --> 21:33.820]  from the canopy, maybe even more as you start introducing these plants to that larger light.
[21:33.820 --> 21:35.780]  As time goes on, you can get closer.
[21:35.780 --> 21:37.600]  They will grow closer to the light.
[21:37.600 --> 21:42.240]  But when you are introducing young plants to large lights, pay attention to how they
[21:42.240 --> 21:43.240]  react.
[21:43.240 --> 21:44.240]  We don't want to burn these lights.
[21:44.240 --> 21:45.400]  We don't want to stress them.
[21:45.400 --> 21:46.400]  I said lights.
[21:46.400 --> 21:47.400]  We don't want to burn the plants.
[21:47.400 --> 21:48.400]  We don't want to stress the plants.
[21:48.400 --> 21:51.520]  We don't want to put them into any kind of shock right as we transplant them.
[21:51.520 --> 21:52.520]  This is a critical time.
[21:52.520 --> 21:54.880]  We are trying to put them into turbo mode right now.
[21:54.880 --> 21:56.360]  We don't want to slow them down.
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.440]  We don't want to punish them and put them on timeout.
[21:58.440 --> 22:01.280]  We want to give them encouragement to take off right now.
[22:01.280 --> 22:03.560]  So we have our plants under the appropriate light.
[22:03.560 --> 22:07.120]  We've got our light the appropriate distance away from our canopy.
[22:07.640 --> 22:11.920]  Let's talk about the amount of light hours we are going to give these plants.
[22:11.920 --> 22:16.400]  I've talked earlier about lighting schedules, and apparently in a previous episode, I did
[22:16.400 --> 22:17.400]  make a mistake.
[22:17.400 --> 22:22.120]  At some point, I said something about 18 on and 16 off or something like that.
[22:22.120 --> 22:25.840]  Somebody said, your light cycle will always add up to 24 hours.
[22:25.840 --> 22:31.000]  If my light cycle I said didn't add up to 24 hours, I was too high to be doing a podcast,
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.440]  and I do apologize.
[22:32.440 --> 22:36.440]  Honestly, when you talk as much as I do, I think you're going to make a few mistakes,
[22:36.440 --> 22:40.920]  and I encourage you guys to let me know when I make a mistake so that I can correct it.
[22:40.920 --> 22:42.240]  And I do apologize.
[22:42.240 --> 22:44.960]  Somebody said I did make a light cycle mistake.
[22:44.960 --> 22:46.360]  I apologize for that.
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.920]  Allow me to correct myself in this part.
[22:48.920 --> 22:53.740]  There are several cycles that work very well for our veg plants.
[22:53.740 --> 22:57.600]  One common cycle is 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[22:57.600 --> 23:03.000]  I mainly recommend this if you have mother plants that tend to auto flower on you or
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.720]  when you were cutting clones.
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.440]  Our next option is 20 hours on and four hours off.
[23:08.440 --> 23:10.960]  I like to give the plants a few hours to sleep.
[23:10.960 --> 23:14.000]  This also gives my equipment four hours to rest.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.520]  When you're running a bedroom with 25 lights, that is 100 hours of lights that you don't
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  have to run.
[23:20.520 --> 23:22.200]  That's a lot of electricity that you save.
[23:22.200 --> 23:25.400]  You're also not paying for as much cooling and humidity control.
[23:25.400 --> 23:27.000]  It makes a big difference.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.120]  So the 20 on and four off is good for your equipment.
[23:30.120 --> 23:32.120]  Also, the plants get to take a nap.
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.240]  Who doesn't want to take a nap?
[23:34.280 --> 23:37.640]  I feel like the roots do a lot of activity in the dark cycle.
[23:37.640 --> 23:40.400]  I feel like the plants grow a lot in the dark cycle.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.880]  Sugars are processed in the dark cycle.
[23:42.880 --> 23:45.280]  So 20 on, four off is great.
[23:45.280 --> 23:50.440]  That will make any plants that may want to auto flower in a lesser cycle, that will prevent
[23:50.440 --> 23:52.040]  them from auto flowering.
[23:52.040 --> 23:57.160]  It will also give you maximum growth and it will keep your mother plants really happy.
[23:57.160 --> 24:01.560]  Another very common veg cycle is 18 on and six off.
[24:01.560 --> 24:07.640]  This is very common because it very closely mimics the outdoor cycle of the natural light.
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.420]  Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[24:11.420 --> 24:13.620]  This is very similar to outdoors as well.
[24:13.620 --> 24:19.320]  The reason people will adjust between the 16 and eight and the 18 and six is because
[24:19.320 --> 24:25.780]  some plants will try to flower on their own with the 16 hours of daylight once they get
[24:25.780 --> 24:28.040]  large enough and once they get root bound.
[24:28.040 --> 24:31.540]  Also, I feel like more light is more energy.
[24:31.540 --> 24:36.740]  Light is the number one desired source of energy and nutrient for our plants.
[24:36.740 --> 24:39.580]  So why not maximize the light input?
[24:39.580 --> 24:43.620]  Of course, some plants will only take so much light per day and they'll just shut themselves
[24:43.620 --> 24:48.620]  down but I don't think you're going to overload them with light in a small grow room with
[24:48.620 --> 24:49.860]  a grow light.
[24:49.860 --> 24:53.580]  So again, our options are 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[24:53.580 --> 24:56.860]  I wouldn't really recommend that for these large veg plants.
[24:56.860 --> 25:00.340]  The next option is 20 hours on and four hours off.
[25:00.340 --> 25:03.340]  In a commercial environment, that is what I would do.
[25:03.340 --> 25:07.140]  In another environment, you can go 18 on and six off.
[25:07.140 --> 25:08.920]  That is very acceptable.
[25:08.920 --> 25:11.700]  Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[25:11.700 --> 25:13.360]  That is very acceptable.
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.980]  Another thing I found advantageous of the 20 on and four off is when I do induce that
[25:18.980 --> 25:24.940]  12-12 flowering cycle, those plants really notice a change in photo period and they really
[25:24.940 --> 25:27.300]  go into flower really quickly.
[25:27.300 --> 25:29.980]  So that's something that I found has helped quite a bit.
[25:29.980 --> 25:33.260]  Any of those light cycles will work for your veg plants.
[25:33.260 --> 25:35.580]  Find what works best for you.
[25:35.580 --> 25:41.220]  You will find pros and cons to each of those options based on your environment, your location,
[25:41.220 --> 25:43.460]  your setup, and your overall grow.
[25:43.460 --> 25:47.700]  You're going to have to find things through trial and error when it comes to growing.
[25:47.700 --> 25:48.860]  Try some things out.
[25:48.860 --> 25:51.260]  See what works best for you and your plants.
[25:51.260 --> 25:55.260]  Ultimately, it's going to come down to what works best for your plants.
[25:55.260 --> 25:56.260]  They are the boss.
[25:57.060 --> 26:00.340]  All right, at this point, our small veg plants have been up-potted.
[26:00.340 --> 26:02.460]  They are now large veg plants.
[26:02.460 --> 26:04.260]  We've got them in their forever pots.
[26:04.260 --> 26:06.020]  We've got them underneath a good light.
[26:06.020 --> 26:08.180]  We've got that light on a solid schedule.
[26:08.180 --> 26:12.180]  We've got our pots sitting on a saucer or some sort of a catch tray.
[26:12.180 --> 26:16.420]  It is now time to water our new transplants.
[26:16.420 --> 26:20.800]  I recommend feeding these transplants with a strong vegetative nutrient.
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.460]  If you've got a bottle that says veg, that's the one you need right now.
[26:24.460 --> 26:27.060]  You need something with a good NPK ratio.
[26:27.060 --> 26:32.220]  You need more N than you do P and K. You need a high N ratio for this time.
[26:32.220 --> 26:34.900]  Also, I would recommend a myco product.
[26:34.900 --> 26:39.140]  If you haven't put plenty of powdered mycos in there, I recommend a mycorrhizal fungal
[26:39.140 --> 26:43.540]  product that is in liquid form that you can feed right in your nutrient solution right
[26:43.540 --> 26:44.540]  now.
[26:44.540 --> 26:45.540]  Mix that in.
[26:45.540 --> 26:47.700]  Also, a small dash of carbs.
[26:47.700 --> 26:50.500]  A little bit of carbohydrates will help feed those mycos.
[26:50.500 --> 26:53.860]  Also, it will give the plants a little bit of energy.
[26:53.860 --> 26:56.540]  I also recommend a little bit of CalMag at this time.
[26:56.540 --> 27:00.340]  The plants are big enough to take CalMag, give them a little bit of a boost.
[27:00.340 --> 27:03.660]  I would also recommend a little bit of enzymes at this time.
[27:03.660 --> 27:04.820]  That will speed everything up.
[27:04.820 --> 27:07.100]  It will help keep the root zone nice and clean.
[27:07.100 --> 27:09.620]  The myco products and the enzymes will work together.
[27:09.620 --> 27:11.380]  They will make a happy rhizosphere.
[27:11.380 --> 27:12.900]  Your plants will thrive.
[27:12.900 --> 27:18.660]  You may also want to add a little bit of potassium silicates at this time.
[27:18.660 --> 27:23.060]  Potassium silicates make for robust plants, and it will also help with any stress.
[27:23.260 --> 27:27.380]  If you have any environmental stressors, that potassium silicate will make the plants just
[27:27.380 --> 27:31.980]  a little more resilient and a little tougher for the mistakes that you may make.
[27:31.980 --> 27:37.220]  Now I recommend you adjust the pH of your feed solution to somewhere between 6.2 and
[27:37.220 --> 27:38.380]  6.4.
[27:38.380 --> 27:43.380]  If we were in cocoa in a commercial facility, I would tell the guys to adjust the pH to
[27:43.380 --> 27:44.380]  6.3.
[27:44.380 --> 27:50.900]  If we were in a soilless mix in a commercial facility, I would tell them to go 6.3 to 6.4.
[27:50.900 --> 27:52.460]  Mix up your nutrient solution.
[27:52.460 --> 27:54.020]  Put your pH meter in there.
[27:54.020 --> 27:57.500]  See what the value is, and adjust up or down as necessary.
[27:57.500 --> 27:58.500]  Write that down.
[27:58.500 --> 28:01.460]  Then, water the plants with that solution.
[28:01.460 --> 28:05.140]  Since we're talking about watering plants, I highly recommend you go back and take a
[28:05.140 --> 28:10.540]  listen to episode 337, which is titled 1-5 Watering Tech.
[28:10.540 --> 28:13.880]  1-5 Watering Tech will help all growers.
[28:13.880 --> 28:18.180]  If you're a new grower, if you're an experienced grower, if you're a professional grower, you
[28:18.180 --> 28:22.140]  will learn something from the 1-5 Water Tech episode.
[28:22.180 --> 28:26.780]  If you are an experienced grower, and you're trying to teach a new grower how to water
[28:26.780 --> 28:31.940]  your garden, 1-5 Water Tech is a great training exercise.
[28:31.940 --> 28:38.700]  I recommend everybody listen to episode 337 and learn about 1-5 Watering Tech.
[28:38.700 --> 28:41.380]  Now, before you water your plants, we talked about the pH.
[28:41.380 --> 28:45.020]  I did not talk about the temperature of the water.
[28:45.020 --> 28:47.860]  It's wintertime in Colorado, and it is really cold.
[28:47.860 --> 28:51.680]  If you're pulling water right out of the tap, it's coming out of the tap way too cold to
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.400]  apply to the plants.
[28:53.400 --> 28:58.400]  We need the water that we feed our plants to be right around 70 degrees.
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.960]  Maybe 65 would be acceptable, but I wouldn't go much lower than 65.
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.360]  Imagine sticking your feet in some 65 degree water first thing in the morning.
[29:07.360 --> 29:11.000]  That's what it's like when you water the plants with 65 degree water.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.560]  I wouldn't go any lower than 65.
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.560]  I would stay closer to 70, maybe up in the 75, not much warmer than that.
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.560]  Right around 70 degrees is just about ideal for watering the plants.
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.560]  In a home grow, you can always just turn the hot water on as you're filling up your container.
[29:25.560 --> 29:29.120]  In some environments, we don't have the option for hot water.
[29:29.120 --> 29:33.300]  If your water is coming out too cold, you can either get a bucket heater from your local
[29:33.300 --> 29:35.320]  tractor or farm supply store.
[29:35.320 --> 29:36.520]  They just sell bucket heaters.
[29:36.520 --> 29:40.160]  They also sell them at the farm supply store for troughs so that you can warm up the pig
[29:40.160 --> 29:43.700]  and horse water so they don't have to drink ice water in the morning.
[29:43.700 --> 29:47.400]  Or if a bucket heater is not an option for you, you can always fill up containers of
[29:47.400 --> 29:48.400]  water.
[29:48.400 --> 29:51.920]  You can always take them into the flowering rooms or the bedrooms the day before and let
[29:51.920 --> 29:55.480]  that light and that grow room environment warm up the water for you.
[29:55.480 --> 29:59.520]  Of course, that's only if you remember to do that the day before.
[29:59.520 --> 30:02.520]  My point is, don't feed the plants water that is really cold.
[30:02.520 --> 30:06.400]  We want that water to be right around 70 degrees.
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.120]  Now in this first watering, make sure you really saturate the medium.
[30:10.120 --> 30:13.340]  Make sure you have plenty of water coming out of those drainage holes.
[30:13.340 --> 30:17.200]  We want to make sure to soak every spot of the container.
[30:17.200 --> 30:21.120]  You don't want a dry spot because roots will not grow into dry areas.
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.760]  Nutrients aren't getting into those dry areas.
[30:23.760 --> 30:25.920]  So make sure you fully saturate the pot.
[30:25.920 --> 30:31.120]  I like to soak it every time I water, but it's mostly important this very first time.
[30:31.120 --> 30:34.560]  Water it till you get a lot of water coming out of those holes.
[30:34.560 --> 30:38.480]  Also don't leave the plant ever standing in stagnant water.
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.480]  If that water in the bottom of your tray there doesn't evaporate or get sucked up by that
[30:42.480 --> 30:47.040]  plant within a few hours, get a shop vac and suck that out of there.
[30:47.040 --> 30:49.920]  All right, so now our plants are all successfully transplanted.
[30:49.920 --> 30:52.320]  They have now been fed their big kid nutrients.
[30:52.320 --> 30:55.420]  Let's talk a little bit about the environment in which to keep these plants.
[30:55.420 --> 30:56.520]  We know where to keep the lights.
[30:56.520 --> 30:58.840]  We know what cycle to have the lights on.
[30:58.840 --> 31:01.080]  Let's talk about the temperature.
[31:01.080 --> 31:05.800]  During the day, I try to keep the temperature between 70 and 80 degrees.
[31:05.800 --> 31:09.440]  Then I try to keep the night around 65 to 75.
[31:09.440 --> 31:16.240]  I really try to have no more than a 10 degree swing in my temperature between day and night.
[31:16.440 --> 31:21.520]  Meaning if it's 70 during the day, I want it no lower than 60 during the night.
[31:21.520 --> 31:24.600]  I honestly try to keep about five to seven degrees in that swing.
[31:24.600 --> 31:26.640]  I know it's difficult in a home grow.
[31:26.640 --> 31:30.520]  Sometimes we don't have the appropriate equipment to monitor and or adjust things all the time,
[31:30.520 --> 31:35.440]  but do your best to keep it within a 10 degree differential between night and day.
[31:35.440 --> 31:40.280]  Now at this point in the large veg phase, I try to keep the humidity between 40 and
[31:40.280 --> 31:41.480]  60%.
[31:41.480 --> 31:43.200]  Right around 50 is ideal.
[31:43.200 --> 31:46.880]  If you want to understand more about why I keep the humidity and the temperature the
[31:46.880 --> 31:52.880]  way I do, I recommend you check out episode 314 and it's called Vapor Pressure Deficit.
[31:52.880 --> 31:57.540]  You can learn about VPD and why it's important to keep the temperature and humidity in the
[31:57.540 --> 32:00.440]  appropriate range for our plants.
[32:00.440 --> 32:03.480]  Another thing I like to add to our large veg is a fan.
[32:03.480 --> 32:07.880]  I like to have wall fans or those fans on stands depending on your setup.
[32:07.880 --> 32:11.320]  I like to have a fan just oscillating in the room, circulating the air.
[32:11.320 --> 32:12.880]  The idea is to circulate the air.
[32:13.560 --> 32:16.920]  I want to move the stale air around and move that fresh air around so the plants have fresh
[32:16.920 --> 32:18.280]  air constantly.
[32:18.280 --> 32:20.440]  You don't need to beat the shit out of the plants with the fan.
[32:20.440 --> 32:24.400]  I go in some grows and they're just terrorizing plants with fans and just beating them to
[32:24.400 --> 32:27.240]  death and wondering why the plants look like shit.
[32:27.240 --> 32:28.660]  We just want to rustle the leaves.
[32:28.660 --> 32:30.600]  We just want to move the air around.
[32:30.600 --> 32:34.960]  So I like to put a fan, about one fan every one or two lights, depending on the size of
[32:34.960 --> 32:39.000]  the room and the environment, but make sure that every area is getting fresh air in that
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.160]  room.
[32:40.160 --> 32:45.720]  At this point, I feel like we have officially entered the large veg phase.
[32:45.720 --> 32:49.880]  Our main goals and focus now are to keep the plants pest and pathogen free.
[32:49.880 --> 32:53.160]  We need to avoid nutrient and pH mistakes.
[32:53.160 --> 32:56.600]  Make sure not to overfeed our plants at this time.
[32:56.600 --> 33:00.960]  Also pay very close attention to the pH of your feeding solutions.
[33:00.960 --> 33:02.920]  We need to keep these plants healthy and vigorous.
[33:02.920 --> 33:04.760]  We need to work on the top part of the plants now.
[33:04.760 --> 33:07.240]  We focused on the bottom for the first half.
[33:07.240 --> 33:09.800]  Now we're going to focus more on the top half.
[33:10.440 --> 33:14.960]  That means in the upcoming episodes, we're going to work on shaping and structuring these plants.
[33:14.960 --> 33:17.440]  We're also going to talk about popping and twisting.
[33:17.440 --> 33:21.960]  Then we'll talk about bottoming and topping and lollipopping our plants, but that is all
[33:21.960 --> 33:24.000]  in upcoming episodes.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.280]  I've got two quick things to cover before we start wrapping up this episode and then
[33:27.280 --> 33:28.960]  we are out of here for this week.
[33:28.960 --> 33:32.740]  You guys, one thing I should talk about is pest management.
[33:32.740 --> 33:33.900]  Now is a good time.
[33:33.900 --> 33:41.860]  If you are going to apply pesticide sprays, today is a good day to start that IPM program.
[33:41.860 --> 33:43.700]  Those plants are moving into the bedroom.
[33:43.700 --> 33:44.900]  They're in their big pots.
[33:44.900 --> 33:48.460]  Let's go ahead and hit them with a light pesticide spray.
[33:48.460 --> 33:52.680]  Turn off the lights, douse the plants, give them a couple hours to dry off, turn the lights
[33:52.680 --> 33:56.700]  back on to the regularly scheduled program and pay attention to those plants.
[33:56.700 --> 33:57.940]  See how they react.
[33:57.940 --> 34:01.100]  Hopefully you wrote down exactly what you sprayed on those plants.
[34:01.100 --> 34:04.860]  You wrote down the product and you wrote how much per gallon you applied.
[34:04.860 --> 34:08.420]  You wrote down what time you applied it and now you have a good frame of reference so
[34:08.420 --> 34:09.700]  you can go in and look.
[34:09.700 --> 34:11.500]  You can see how the plants reacted.
[34:11.500 --> 34:15.040]  If they look angry, you need to reduce the application next time.
[34:15.040 --> 34:19.380]  If they look happy about it, you can do the same thing or consider increasing the application
[34:19.380 --> 34:21.420]  rate if necessary.
[34:21.420 --> 34:25.820]  I generally start my heavy pest management application right when I move them into the
[34:25.820 --> 34:27.600]  large pots.
[34:27.600 --> 34:30.820]  Another thing that will be important to think about is flip time.
[34:30.820 --> 34:34.340]  How long are these plants going to veg in this environment?
[34:34.340 --> 34:36.420]  How much space do you have?
[34:36.420 --> 34:41.020]  Depending on your genetics, depending on your lighting, depending on your overall environment,
[34:41.020 --> 34:43.800]  these plants could double in size.
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.700]  If you were working within a rise cross, there is a good likelihood that by the time you
[34:48.700 --> 34:54.460]  finish that plant, it will be twice the size it was when you started the flowering process.
[34:54.460 --> 34:59.060]  So if that plant is 24 inches tall when you induce flowering, there's a good chance that
[34:59.060 --> 35:03.020]  plant will end up 48 inches tall before it is done.
[35:03.020 --> 35:05.220]  So as a grower, you need to plan ahead.
[35:05.220 --> 35:09.500]  You need to make sure that plant does not grow up into your lights and burn itself.
[35:09.500 --> 35:12.860]  You need to save, depending on the type of light you're using, you need to save some
[35:12.860 --> 35:16.000]  space between the bulb and your top cola.
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.500]  So plan ahead.
[35:17.500 --> 35:20.720]  Now is the time to start thinking about how long we're going to veg.
[35:20.720 --> 35:23.220]  If you veg too long, the plants will get too tall.
[35:23.220 --> 35:24.740]  You'll have problems.
[35:24.740 --> 35:28.580]  We're also going to do things like topping and bottoming and lollipopping and twisting
[35:28.600 --> 35:32.020]  and cracking and trellising and manipulating these plants.
[35:32.020 --> 35:35.260]  So we're going to need to give them a little bit of time to recover from some of these
[35:35.260 --> 35:38.660]  techniques before we initiate the flowering process.
[35:38.660 --> 35:45.420]  So if we plan ahead and know how long we anticipate to veg, we can predict when to do these steps
[35:45.420 --> 35:50.260]  to increase production and flower at the ideal time and fill our grow space perfectly.
[35:50.260 --> 35:54.340]  We can end up with our canopy right about eight inches below that light and it'll be
[35:54.340 --> 35:55.920]  nice and even and it'll look beautiful.
[35:55.920 --> 35:58.300]  You won't have any wasted space in there.
[35:58.300 --> 36:02.380]  Once you're an experienced grower, your goal will be to fill your grow space.
[36:02.380 --> 36:07.020]  If you've got a five by five grow tent, you want a five by five canopy or at least a four
[36:07.020 --> 36:10.980]  and a half by four and a half canopy because when the air flows, it sucks in a little bit,
[36:10.980 --> 36:13.340]  but you want to fill most of that space.
[36:13.340 --> 36:17.980]  A very experienced grower, an older guy, he said one day, if you had a cooler and you
[36:17.980 --> 36:21.160]  could fill it with beer, would you fill it most of the way to the top with beer or would
[36:21.160 --> 36:23.220]  you fill that cooler all the way with beer?
[36:23.220 --> 36:25.540]  I'm not even a beer drinker and that makes sense to me.
[36:25.540 --> 36:27.620]  I want as many beers fit in that cooler.
[36:27.620 --> 36:28.620]  That's just the way you do it.
[36:28.620 --> 36:32.180]  So do you want your grow room to be halfway filled with buds or do you want to fill that
[36:32.180 --> 36:33.580]  fucker up with buds?
[36:33.580 --> 36:37.300]  The goal will be to maximize that canopy space.
[36:37.300 --> 36:40.860]  So in future episodes, we will talk about trellising, lollipopping.
[36:40.860 --> 36:43.180]  We'll talk about sticks and cages and cracking stems.
[36:43.180 --> 36:47.740]  We will go in depth in a lot of techniques like that on ways to fill up your cooler for
[36:47.740 --> 36:48.740]  maximum production.
[36:48.740 --> 36:52.020]  All right, podcast world, that is a podcast for this week.
