[00:15.610 --> 00:18.090]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:18.090 --> 00:19.970]  It's time for episode number 237
[00:19.970 --> 00:21.770]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.770 --> 00:25.650]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.650 --> 00:26.890]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.890 --> 00:28.170]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.170 --> 00:30.730]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.730 --> 00:32.210]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.210 --> 00:33.610]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.610 --> 00:35.370]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.370 --> 00:38.190]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.190 --> 00:40.010]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.010 --> 00:41.810]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.810 --> 00:43.910]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.910 --> 00:45.510]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.510 --> 00:47.990]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.990 --> 00:51.870]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.170 --> 00:56.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, maybe you can hear it in my voice.
[00:56.230 --> 00:59.430]  I just took a gigantic dab and it's got me all raspied up.
[00:59.430 --> 01:01.130]  I've been dabbing some lemon skunk
[01:01.130 --> 01:03.310]  with capeltin mixed into it.
[01:03.310 --> 01:04.630]  And then I just took a big dab
[01:04.630 --> 01:07.670]  of some Screamin' Tangerines batter.
[01:07.670 --> 01:10.830]  And I taste the tangerines and I can hear the scream.
[01:10.830 --> 01:12.590]  That is for sure, my head is spinning.
[01:12.590 --> 01:14.070]  I'm nice and dabbed out.
[01:14.070 --> 01:16.390]  It's got my voice in my throat feeling a little funky,
[01:16.390 --> 01:18.830]  but I'm sure that will correct itself as I go on.
[01:20.110 --> 01:22.390]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[01:22.390 --> 01:24.790]  I hope you guys saw the eclipse.
[01:24.790 --> 01:26.390]  A lot of North America got to witness
[01:26.390 --> 01:28.850]  a really cool eclipse on Monday.
[01:28.850 --> 01:29.790]  And it was super cool.
[01:29.790 --> 01:31.470]  You know, I'd kinda, I heard about it.
[01:31.470 --> 01:32.510]  I knew it was coming, but I was like,
[01:32.510 --> 01:33.830]  yeah, an eclipse, that'll be neat.
[01:33.830 --> 01:34.950]  I'm gonna be at work when that happens.
[01:34.950 --> 01:36.270]  But then everybody started talking about it,
[01:36.270 --> 01:37.870]  talking about how big of a deal it was.
[01:37.870 --> 01:39.430]  People were traveling to other states.
[01:39.430 --> 01:41.470]  People were going to Wyoming and Idaho
[01:41.510 --> 01:43.190]  to go check out this eclipse.
[01:43.190 --> 01:44.430]  And I wasn't taking it seriously
[01:44.430 --> 01:46.830]  until the morning of the eclipse.
[01:46.830 --> 01:48.790]  The eclipse happened, it actually happened
[01:48.790 --> 01:51.230]  at like 1147 in the morning.
[01:51.230 --> 01:52.590]  I didn't even really start thinking about it
[01:52.590 --> 01:53.430]  until about eight in the morning.
[01:53.430 --> 01:54.590]  Everybody was like, dude, the eclipse,
[01:54.590 --> 01:56.310]  the eclipse, the eclipse.
[01:56.310 --> 01:59.390]  So I walked outside to take out some trash around 11
[01:59.390 --> 02:00.790]  and I was like, what the fuck's going on?
[02:00.790 --> 02:03.430]  It was like middle of the day, basically,
[02:03.430 --> 02:04.490]  and it was dark outside.
[02:04.490 --> 02:07.030]  It was real overcast looking and the clouds had like
[02:07.030 --> 02:10.510]  a blue and pink sort of a tie-dyed tint to them.
[02:10.550 --> 02:11.870]  It was really cool.
[02:11.870 --> 02:13.070]  Looked like an old Grateful Dead shirt
[02:13.070 --> 02:14.710]  or something in the sky.
[02:14.710 --> 02:17.030]  So we went back outside around 1145
[02:17.030 --> 02:18.530]  when the whole eclipse thing was happening
[02:18.530 --> 02:19.630]  and it was pretty rad.
[02:19.630 --> 02:21.650]  You couldn't look directly into the sun
[02:21.650 --> 02:24.270]  because that's how you go blind and that sucks.
[02:24.270 --> 02:27.070]  But what I could see from, what I actually did was
[02:27.070 --> 02:28.790]  I held my cell phone in selfie mode
[02:28.790 --> 02:30.590]  so that I could see myself in the screen
[02:30.590 --> 02:32.490]  and I turned my back to the sun
[02:32.490 --> 02:34.510]  so that the sun was shining into my camera screen
[02:34.510 --> 02:36.230]  and I could see a picture of it that way.
[02:36.230 --> 02:39.390]  I got to snap pretty cool couple of pictures of myself
[02:39.390 --> 02:40.230]  and the eclipse.
[02:40.230 --> 02:41.950]  That was pretty fun, but it was really neat.
[02:41.950 --> 02:43.910]  What it did to the sky was kind of neat,
[02:43.910 --> 02:46.430]  but the way that it affected everybody was really cool.
[02:46.430 --> 02:48.950]  Everybody was in a really weird mood all day.
[02:48.950 --> 02:50.590]  People were just acting super strange
[02:50.590 --> 02:52.870]  and I was blaming it on the eclipse.
[02:52.870 --> 02:54.270]  I'm gonna turn that music down.
[02:54.270 --> 02:55.870]  I feel like I'm trying to yell over it.
[02:55.870 --> 02:57.770]  Anyway, I hope you got to see the eclipse.
[02:57.770 --> 02:59.030]  That was kind of cool.
[02:59.030 --> 03:00.710]  Maybe like a once in a lifetime sort of thing
[03:00.710 --> 03:02.970]  unless you live for a really long time.
[03:02.970 --> 03:04.670]  I didn't really give it enough respect
[03:04.670 --> 03:05.490]  when I heard about it.
[03:05.490 --> 03:06.670]  I didn't take it seriously.
[03:06.670 --> 03:09.950]  I'm glad that I did take a moment to pay attention to it.
[03:09.950 --> 03:11.670]  I don't know that I'll get to see another eclipse
[03:11.670 --> 03:12.750]  like that in my lifetime.
[03:12.750 --> 03:13.950]  I don't know when the next one will happen,
[03:13.950 --> 03:16.350]  but it doesn't seem to happen very frequently.
[03:16.350 --> 03:18.510]  I guess I'm pretty lucky because now I've seen several,
[03:18.510 --> 03:20.790]  I think I've seen a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse,
[03:20.790 --> 03:24.110]  and in my lifetime, Halley's Comet has passed through.
[03:24.110 --> 03:28.150]  So I get to see a whole bunch of cool astrological shit.
[03:28.150 --> 03:29.770]  All right, on the last episode, you guys,
[03:29.770 --> 03:31.870]  I was kind of bragging about getting to go see
[03:31.870 --> 03:33.550]  Greg Proops at Comedy Works.
[03:33.550 --> 03:38.190]  So Wednesday at Comedy Works, Greg Proops did not go.
[03:38.190 --> 03:40.710]  Mr. Proops was in London last week,
[03:40.710 --> 03:42.910]  and here's the story that he told.
[03:42.910 --> 03:45.790]  Greg Proops was in London, and he was at a hotel,
[03:45.790 --> 03:47.830]  and a light bulb went out in a lamp,
[03:47.830 --> 03:50.590]  and Mr. Proops attempted to replace the light bulb,
[03:50.590 --> 03:51.870]  and he says that when he turned it,
[03:51.870 --> 03:55.030]  the light bulb exploded, and it cut his thumb to the bone.
[03:55.030 --> 03:57.730]  He posted a photo of himself on Instagram
[03:57.730 --> 03:59.710]  with a really groovy pink cast.
[03:59.710 --> 04:01.470]  He looks pretty fucked up.
[04:01.470 --> 04:03.150]  I've never seen the man look so disheveled.
[04:03.710 --> 04:05.190]  He's usually a pretty sharp-looking man.
[04:05.190 --> 04:06.150]  His hair is always perfect.
[04:06.150 --> 04:07.710]  His glasses are always straight.
[04:07.710 --> 04:09.550]  His suit is always perfect.
[04:09.550 --> 04:10.550]  This picture on Instagram,
[04:10.550 --> 04:12.670]  he looked like he may have just woken up.
[04:12.670 --> 04:16.170]  So did not get to see Mr. Proops.
[04:16.170 --> 04:18.790]  They offered another comedy show in place of Mr. Proops,
[04:18.790 --> 04:20.670]  but it was a comedian that I've seen before,
[04:20.670 --> 04:22.790]  and I would not drive to Denver
[04:22.790 --> 04:24.430]  to see him again on a Wednesday.
[04:24.430 --> 04:26.270]  No offense to that comedian.
[04:26.270 --> 04:27.590]  It's 130 miles.
[04:27.590 --> 04:29.270]  It's two hours each direction.
[04:30.090 --> 04:32.110]  There's a two-drink minimum.
[04:32.110 --> 04:33.630]  So you're looking at least a tank of gas
[04:33.630 --> 04:34.470]  and a couple of drinks,
[04:34.470 --> 04:36.310]  and then dinner while you're out.
[04:36.310 --> 04:39.790]  And I'm not gonna pay that to see a backup comedian
[04:39.790 --> 04:42.310]  when I had plans to see Mr. Proops.
[04:42.310 --> 04:44.430]  So I chilled out Wednesday, did a few other things.
[04:44.430 --> 04:46.150]  Didn't get to see Proops.
[04:46.150 --> 04:47.550]  Oh, well, he's rescheduled the show.
[04:47.550 --> 04:51.010]  He will be back in about a month, maybe two months.
[04:51.010 --> 04:52.710]  I'll get to see him then.
[04:52.710 --> 04:54.510]  Another brag, Sunday night,
[04:54.510 --> 04:57.470]  I get to see Mr. Bert Kreischer, the machine at ComedyWorks.
[04:57.470 --> 04:59.270]  I'll let you guys know how that one goes.
[04:59.270 --> 05:01.230]  I'm sure it's gonna be a good time.
[05:01.230 --> 05:02.430]  All right, I'm gonna quit bragging.
[05:02.430 --> 05:04.350]  Let's move into some iTunes comments.
[05:04.350 --> 05:06.510]  I haven't read iTunes comments in quite a while.
[05:06.510 --> 05:09.190]  I think this comment here, yes, this was left August 8th.
[05:09.190 --> 05:10.350]  So I think this is new,
[05:10.350 --> 05:13.310]  and I do not think I've read this on the show yet.
[05:13.310 --> 05:14.670]  Maybe.
[05:14.670 --> 05:17.390]  Hey, if I did, I'm gonna read this one twice.
[05:17.390 --> 05:18.850]  This is an iTunes review.
[05:19.730 --> 05:20.910]  If you are an iTunes listener,
[05:20.910 --> 05:22.190]  I encourage you to go to iTunes.
[05:22.190 --> 05:23.530]  Go to the iTunes store,
[05:23.530 --> 05:25.430]  search for The Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[05:25.430 --> 05:27.630]  scroll down, it's about halfway to the bottom of the page.
[05:27.630 --> 05:29.770]  You'll see a picture of my lovely mug
[05:29.770 --> 05:31.570]  over a red, yellow, and green flag.
[05:31.570 --> 05:32.490]  Click on that.
[05:32.490 --> 05:33.730]  In the middle of that page,
[05:33.730 --> 05:36.850]  there will be a section that says Ratings and Reviews.
[05:36.850 --> 05:38.490]  Click on the Ratings and Reviews.
[05:38.490 --> 05:40.290]  I encourage you to type a little review.
[05:40.290 --> 05:42.130]  Let me know what you think of the podcast,
[05:42.130 --> 05:43.370]  and then click on the amount of stars
[05:43.370 --> 05:44.250]  that you think I deserve.
[05:44.250 --> 05:47.490]  So far, everybody has kindly given me a five-star review.
[05:47.490 --> 05:48.510]  Let's see what we've got up here.
[05:48.510 --> 05:53.310]  We've got 63 ratings, and all of them are five stars.
[05:53.310 --> 05:55.470]  So let's read the most recent review.
[05:55.470 --> 05:56.870]  The headline is very informative,
[05:56.870 --> 05:59.470]  and it's by a person who calls themselves
[05:59.470 --> 06:02.070]  Ray Straub is their iTunes handle.
[06:02.070 --> 06:04.350]  The comment goes like this.
[06:04.350 --> 06:06.950]  This podcast, no, let me start it with a different,
[06:06.950 --> 06:09.030]  let me put my inflection in a different spot here.
[06:09.030 --> 06:12.590]  This podcast and Stuff You Should Know are my two favorites.
[06:12.590 --> 06:13.510]  Keep up the good work.
[06:13.510 --> 06:15.210]  I love the Throwback Thursday episodes
[06:15.210 --> 06:16.730]  for those long road trips,
[06:16.730 --> 06:19.170]  just hard to take notes while driving.
[06:20.390 --> 06:21.450]  Dude, I hope you're not taking notes
[06:21.450 --> 06:23.710]  of the podcast while driving.
[06:23.710 --> 06:25.330]  Please press pause.
[06:25.330 --> 06:26.310]  Please have a passenger.
[06:26.670 --> 06:28.350]  Don't write while you're driving, please.
[06:28.350 --> 06:30.070]  And also, excuse me for all the throat clearing, you guys.
[06:30.070 --> 06:31.650]  That giant dab I took a couple of minutes ago,
[06:31.650 --> 06:34.790]  it's still working, and it's choking me up still,
[06:34.790 --> 06:35.630]  but we'll get past that.
[06:35.630 --> 06:36.850]  Don't worry.
[06:36.850 --> 06:39.710]  So he says that my podcast and another podcast
[06:39.710 --> 06:42.230]  called Stuff You Should Know are his two favorites,
[06:42.230 --> 06:43.990]  or this person, I don't know if it's a male or female.
[06:43.990 --> 06:44.870]  I've gotta stop doing that.
[06:44.870 --> 06:45.710]  I apologize.
[06:46.710 --> 06:48.630]  They say this podcast and Stuff You Should Know
[06:48.630 --> 06:49.470]  are their favorites.
[06:49.470 --> 06:50.870]  That's pretty cool,
[06:50.870 --> 06:53.070]  because Stuff You Should Know is a really good podcast also,
[06:53.070 --> 06:55.630]  and I always see that one in the top 50
[06:55.630 --> 06:58.190]  or top 100 podcasts for different categories.
[06:58.190 --> 07:00.030]  It's in the same categories as myself also,
[07:00.030 --> 07:02.430]  so it's cool to know that you're listening to both of us.
[07:02.430 --> 07:03.270]  Keep up the good work.
[07:03.270 --> 07:04.470]  Yes, I will.
[07:04.470 --> 07:06.190]  I will do my best.
[07:06.190 --> 07:09.270]  I am a busy man, and I have not missed an episode
[07:09.270 --> 07:12.630]  in it's been three something,
[07:12.630 --> 07:14.710]  almost four years now, I think.
[07:14.710 --> 07:16.350]  So yes, thanks for the encouragement.
[07:16.350 --> 07:18.670]  I will do my best to keep it going as long as I can,
[07:18.670 --> 07:21.630]  as long as I have a voice, a microphone,
[07:21.630 --> 07:25.710]  some sort of USB interface, and a MacBook,
[07:25.710 --> 07:28.870]  and some wifi, I'll do my best to get this show going.
[07:28.870 --> 07:30.750]  I love the Throwback Thursday episodes
[07:30.750 --> 07:32.190]  for those long road trips.
[07:32.190 --> 07:33.030]  Thank you.
[07:33.030 --> 07:33.850]  Thanks for that comment,
[07:33.850 --> 07:35.510]  because it's good to know people are listening
[07:35.510 --> 07:36.510]  to those long episodes.
[07:36.510 --> 07:37.830]  Making those takes a few minutes,
[07:37.830 --> 07:39.490]  because it ties up my computer.
[07:39.490 --> 07:42.030]  I have to drag an hour file
[07:42.030 --> 07:43.350]  into a bunch of three hour files,
[07:43.350 --> 07:45.150]  and once you get that three hour project
[07:45.150 --> 07:45.990]  on GarageBand going,
[07:45.990 --> 07:48.190]  it really makes everything go super slow,
[07:48.190 --> 07:50.190]  so there'll be times when I just get the spin,
[07:50.190 --> 07:51.870]  and I don't get to do anything else with my computer,
[07:51.870 --> 07:53.590]  and I just gotta sit here and stare at it.
[07:53.590 --> 07:55.230]  So thanks for listening to the Thursday episodes.
[07:55.230 --> 07:56.550]  I'm glad you appreciate those.
[07:56.550 --> 08:00.470]  Loading those things to iTunes takes forever.
[08:00.470 --> 08:01.670]  I'm glad you're listening.
[08:01.670 --> 08:02.750]  And if you don't know what he's talking about,
[08:02.750 --> 08:04.710]  ladies and gentlemen, every Thursday,
[08:04.710 --> 08:06.430]  I put out blocks of old episodes.
[08:06.430 --> 08:09.230]  What happened is, I got to 200 and something episodes,
[08:09.230 --> 08:11.850]  and old episodes started dropping out of the iTunes feed,
[08:11.850 --> 08:13.110]  and out of the Stitcher feed.
[08:13.110 --> 08:14.750]  iTunes and Stitcher, and my website,
[08:14.750 --> 08:16.590]  only hold 100 episodes.
[08:17.590 --> 08:20.870]  A lot of crucial and very informative content
[08:20.870 --> 08:24.550]  are in episodes, probably between 50 and 100,
[08:24.550 --> 08:26.070]  are some of the most educational
[08:26.070 --> 08:29.150]  and well put together podcasts I've ever done.
[08:29.150 --> 08:30.670]  I had a lot of stuff pre-written,
[08:30.670 --> 08:32.590]  and I was able to go back and use old material
[08:32.590 --> 08:34.630]  that I'd been working on for a long time,
[08:34.630 --> 08:35.590]  and use things like,
[08:35.590 --> 08:36.430]  there are episodes like,
[08:36.430 --> 08:39.210]  Scheduling a Perpetual Harvest.
[08:39.210 --> 08:40.550]  That's one of the best episodes
[08:40.550 --> 08:42.710]  I ever put out, in my opinion.
[08:42.710 --> 08:45.070]  That could have been a million dollar book,
[08:45.070 --> 08:46.270]  had I decided to do it that way,
[08:46.950 --> 08:47.950]  but I put it out there for free,
[08:47.950 --> 08:49.350]  and I wanted everybody to hear it.
[08:49.350 --> 08:50.810]  But then it got washed away from the feed.
[08:50.810 --> 08:53.910]  Once there was 173 episodes, or something like that,
[08:53.910 --> 08:55.990]  that episode was gone and no longer available.
[08:55.990 --> 08:58.030]  So I started putting together chunks of old episodes,
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.630]  like episodes one through five,
[08:59.630 --> 09:01.070]  and six through 10, or whatever.
[09:01.070 --> 09:03.230]  I started putting those back on Thursdays,
[09:03.230 --> 09:05.630]  so that you guys can listen to that old content.
[09:05.630 --> 09:06.470]  Now what's happened,
[09:06.470 --> 09:09.430]  is I've gotten so far into those old episodes,
[09:09.430 --> 09:12.310]  that old episodes are being knocked out of the feed.
[09:12.310 --> 09:15.310]  Like one through three, and six through whatever,
[09:15.310 --> 09:16.670]  those are all gone out of the feed.
[09:16.670 --> 09:18.910]  So what I've done, is I've made a YouTube page,
[09:18.910 --> 09:20.110]  and now you can go watch,
[09:20.110 --> 09:21.990]  I think it's one through 76,
[09:21.990 --> 09:24.430]  are now available on the YouTube channel.
[09:25.630 --> 09:28.310]  And I do promise to keep posting more videos.
[09:28.310 --> 09:30.370]  Like I said, my computer gets tied up,
[09:30.370 --> 09:32.230]  I can only do one thing at a time on the MacBook,
[09:32.230 --> 09:33.070]  but I can do a lot of things,
[09:33.070 --> 09:34.470]  but when you're doing something like a podcast,
[09:34.470 --> 09:36.670]  or a video, it just sucks everything up.
[09:36.670 --> 09:39.150]  You can only do one thing at that point,
[09:39.150 --> 09:40.310]  kinda at the computer's mercy,
[09:40.310 --> 09:41.970]  but I will get all the stuff going.
[09:41.970 --> 09:45.210]  My point is, the old episodes are up,
[09:46.050 --> 09:46.890]  in the feed, in chunks,
[09:46.890 --> 09:47.710]  and they're also up on YouTube.
[09:47.710 --> 09:48.850]  That's what this guy's talking about,
[09:48.850 --> 09:50.730]  the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[09:51.730 --> 09:52.810]  All right, Ray Straubona,
[09:52.810 --> 09:55.090]  thank you for the great iTunes review.
[09:55.090 --> 09:55.930]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[09:55.930 --> 09:59.770]  I look forward to reading your review on a future episode.
[09:59.770 --> 10:01.530]  All right, let's move forward into the podcast.
[10:01.530 --> 10:05.210]  On the last episode, I did what I called a glossary,
[10:05.210 --> 10:06.570]  and I kinda corrected some terms
[10:06.570 --> 10:08.050]  that people have been using wrong,
[10:08.050 --> 10:10.170]  and I haven't heard back from the person
[10:10.170 --> 10:11.610]  that I was aiming one message at,
[10:11.610 --> 10:12.670]  so I think we're all good,
[10:12.670 --> 10:13.670]  I think we're still friends,
[10:13.670 --> 10:15.190]  I think everything is cool.
[10:15.190 --> 10:17.810]  But, I've got a couple more things to add
[10:17.810 --> 10:21.390]  to the Rasta Jeff glossary of ganja growing.
[10:21.390 --> 10:23.830]  Something that I hear people use incorrectly all the time,
[10:23.830 --> 10:25.910]  and it drives me fucking crazy,
[10:25.910 --> 10:27.030]  and a lot of my friends mention
[10:27.030 --> 10:29.710]  that it drives them fucking crazy also,
[10:29.710 --> 10:32.190]  is the word strand.
[10:32.190 --> 10:33.910]  You're not growing strands,
[10:33.910 --> 10:35.710]  you don't have strands of plants,
[10:35.710 --> 10:37.350]  strands are hairs.
[10:37.350 --> 10:39.770]  You've got strains.
[10:39.770 --> 10:40.610]  You wouldn't say,
[10:40.610 --> 10:43.510]  hey, my favorite strand of weed is OG Kush,
[10:44.350 --> 10:45.190]  you would say,
[10:45.190 --> 10:47.110]  my favorite strain of cannabis is OG Kush,
[10:47.110 --> 10:49.630]  and that would be a completely correct statement.
[10:49.630 --> 10:52.230]  All right, so let's quit saying strand,
[10:52.230 --> 10:54.830]  and let's replace it with strain.
[10:54.830 --> 10:56.470]  Strain is more appropriate.
[10:56.470 --> 10:57.810]  If you wanna be technical,
[10:57.810 --> 11:00.390]  you can go with the word cultivar.
[11:00.390 --> 11:03.270]  Cultivar would be the same thing.
[11:03.270 --> 11:06.510]  All right, that moves me into another word
[11:06.510 --> 11:09.390]  that is probably going to get me off on a rant,
[11:09.390 --> 11:11.230]  but that's okay.
[11:11.230 --> 11:13.910]  Another word that I hear people mispronounce
[11:13.910 --> 11:17.830]  and misuse quite often is the word phenotype,
[11:17.830 --> 11:22.830]  and it's P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E, phenotype.
[11:24.690 --> 11:26.630]  I hear a lot of people mispronounce this word,
[11:26.630 --> 11:28.910]  they say phenome, or phenome,
[11:28.910 --> 11:29.850]  there are just so many other ways,
[11:29.850 --> 11:31.190]  I can't even think of the wrong ones,
[11:31.190 --> 11:32.230]  but we shorten it often,
[11:32.230 --> 11:33.070]  we say phenome,
[11:33.070 --> 11:35.030]  and I hear people say phenome,
[11:35.030 --> 11:35.870]  and stuff like that,
[11:35.870 --> 11:37.950]  it's just phenome and phenotype.
[11:37.950 --> 11:39.750]  The actual definition is,
[11:39.750 --> 11:41.950]  the set of observable characteristics
[11:41.950 --> 11:44.270]  of an individual resulting from the interaction
[11:44.270 --> 11:47.210]  of its genotype with the environment,
[11:47.210 --> 11:49.110]  and this is why I said it may get me off on a rant,
[11:49.110 --> 11:51.590]  there are a lot of things I feel like I should explain
[11:51.590 --> 11:53.610]  to be a good podcast host.
[11:53.610 --> 11:55.790]  The set of observable characteristics,
[11:55.790 --> 11:56.710]  so that could be,
[11:56.710 --> 11:58.510]  if we could talk about a lot of different things here,
[11:58.510 --> 11:59.350]  it could be people,
[11:59.350 --> 12:00.170]  it could be animals,
[12:00.170 --> 12:01.070]  or we could be talking about plants,
[12:01.070 --> 12:01.970]  we'll stick with plants,
[12:01.970 --> 12:03.170]  and we'll stick with cannabis plants
[12:03.170 --> 12:04.590]  to keep this relevant.
[12:04.590 --> 12:06.950]  The set of observable characteristics,
[12:06.950 --> 12:08.570]  so that could be,
[12:08.570 --> 12:09.510]  is it purple?
[12:10.230 --> 12:11.070]  Is it tall and stretchy?
[12:11.070 --> 12:12.550]  Is it short and stout?
[12:12.550 --> 12:13.750]  Is it red?
[12:13.750 --> 12:14.930]  I've seen cannabis turn red,
[12:14.930 --> 12:17.030]  I've seen cannabis turn yellow.
[12:17.030 --> 12:20.110]  Those are observable characteristics of an individual,
[12:20.110 --> 12:23.230]  the individual in this case being our cannabis plant.
[12:23.230 --> 12:26.390]  Those observable characteristics are results
[12:26.390 --> 12:29.590]  from the interaction with its environment.
[12:29.590 --> 12:32.170]  So a lot of times you see plants turning purple,
[12:32.170 --> 12:33.590]  that's because of its environment,
[12:33.590 --> 12:36.510]  so that is resulting from the interaction
[12:36.510 --> 12:37.390]  with its environment.
[12:37.390 --> 12:38.790]  If you see fox tailing,
[12:38.790 --> 12:41.990]  that's often a result of its interaction
[12:41.990 --> 12:43.230]  with the environment.
[12:43.230 --> 12:44.070]  Now genotype,
[12:44.070 --> 12:45.310]  I skipped the word genotype
[12:45.310 --> 12:46.990]  when I gave you a quick definition
[12:46.990 --> 12:48.110]  to break down some of these words.
[12:48.110 --> 12:49.510]  Genotype,
[12:49.510 --> 12:51.350]  the genotype is basically,
[12:51.350 --> 12:52.690]  you cannot change the genotype,
[12:52.690 --> 12:56.130]  that is the mom and dad made these genes,
[12:56.130 --> 12:57.310]  that's the genotype.
[12:57.310 --> 12:58.590]  So that's always going to be there,
[12:58.590 --> 13:02.950]  that genotype will have phenotypical expressions.
[13:02.950 --> 13:05.030]  And those phenotypical expressions
[13:05.030 --> 13:06.130]  will be things like I mentioned,
[13:06.170 --> 13:07.290]  like I've,
[13:07.290 --> 13:08.850]  so let's say you take the same plant,
[13:08.850 --> 13:10.890]  let's say I grow a plant from seed,
[13:10.890 --> 13:12.530]  I cut two clones of it,
[13:12.530 --> 13:13.650]  and I give a clone to you,
[13:13.650 --> 13:16.010]  and I give a clone to whoever else,
[13:16.010 --> 13:17.490]  and you guys take it to your grow,
[13:17.490 --> 13:18.410]  and you grow it,
[13:18.410 --> 13:21.550]  you're going to see different phenotypical expressions
[13:21.550 --> 13:22.610]  from different grow rooms
[13:22.610 --> 13:24.530]  because you have different environments.
[13:24.530 --> 13:27.250]  One guy may get more purple on the stems,
[13:27.250 --> 13:30.170]  one guy may get more turps and more aroma,
[13:30.170 --> 13:31.770]  one guy may get airier buds,
[13:31.770 --> 13:34.330]  one may get real dense rock hard buds,
[13:34.330 --> 13:36.050]  and that is a phenotypical expression,
[13:36.970 --> 13:37.890]  that could be based on how much light,
[13:37.890 --> 13:38.850]  how much air,
[13:38.850 --> 13:39.890]  how much water,
[13:39.890 --> 13:41.210]  what kind of nutrients,
[13:41.210 --> 13:43.650]  that could be based on so many factors,
[13:43.650 --> 13:47.390]  a lot of it could be based on one little factor,
[13:47.390 --> 13:49.210]  it just depends on what those things are,
[13:49.210 --> 13:53.050]  we talked in an earlier show about everything adding up,
[13:53.050 --> 13:55.570]  it could be any one thing that makes a difference
[13:55.570 --> 13:58.610]  in your phenotypical expressions.
[13:59.490 --> 14:02.090]  So let me talk a little bit more about phenotypes
[14:02.090 --> 14:03.730]  and maybe give a couple of examples.
[14:03.770 --> 14:06.690]  I like to talk about Jilly Bean on the podcast,
[14:06.690 --> 14:07.890]  I did not breed Jilly Bean,
[14:07.890 --> 14:10.610]  Jilly Bean was bred by Miss Jill,
[14:10.610 --> 14:13.130]  and it is put out by TGA genetics,
[14:13.130 --> 14:14.930]  which is ran by Subcool,
[14:14.930 --> 14:15.770]  team green Avengers,
[14:15.770 --> 14:17.090]  so you can pick up your Jilly Bean seeds,
[14:17.090 --> 14:19.210]  probably a thousand different vendors,
[14:19.210 --> 14:20.730]  but Jilly Bean is a great example,
[14:20.730 --> 14:22.610]  because Jilly Bean puts out
[14:22.610 --> 14:24.850]  basically three different phenotypes,
[14:24.850 --> 14:26.690]  and there are two that you're looking for,
[14:26.690 --> 14:29.050]  and since it's kind of an older strain,
[14:29.050 --> 14:31.250]  and it puts out three basic phenotypes,
[14:31.250 --> 14:32.370]  and there are two that you're looking for,
[14:32.370 --> 14:33.490]  it's kind of a known thing,
[14:34.330 --> 14:35.610]  if you're into Subcool,
[14:35.610 --> 14:38.170]  and if you paid any attention to Subcool and read forums,
[14:38.170 --> 14:39.850]  this is kind of a known thing that's talked about,
[14:39.850 --> 14:44.850]  Jilly Bean has one phenotype that's kind of not desirable,
[14:45.130 --> 14:46.050]  nothing's wrong with it,
[14:46.050 --> 14:47.170]  it's just not the one you want,
[14:47.170 --> 14:49.690]  there are two others that you'd rather get,
[14:49.690 --> 14:52.290]  there's one that smells like a bag of oranges,
[14:52.290 --> 14:53.930]  or maybe a glass of orange juice,
[14:53.930 --> 14:56.170]  with a little bit of pineapple juice put into it,
[14:56.170 --> 14:57.550]  is what I think it smells like,
[14:57.550 --> 14:59.210]  it smells delicious,
[14:59.210 --> 15:01.330]  it's the orange pheno is what it's known as,
[15:01.370 --> 15:02.730]  is because it's the phenotype
[15:02.730 --> 15:05.490]  that expresses a very orange aroma,
[15:05.490 --> 15:06.810]  wherever you take that plant,
[15:06.810 --> 15:07.730]  wherever you grow it,
[15:07.730 --> 15:09.370]  it's gonna smell and taste like oranges,
[15:09.370 --> 15:11.250]  because that's its phenotypical expression,
[15:11.250 --> 15:12.490]  that's what it does,
[15:12.490 --> 15:15.730]  I've never had that one that didn't taste like oranges,
[15:15.730 --> 15:17.490]  it's just what it does,
[15:17.490 --> 15:19.210]  there's another one that is known
[15:19.210 --> 15:21.210]  as the candy store phenotype,
[15:21.210 --> 15:26.210]  and it smells like jelly beans and Skittles,
[15:26.290 --> 15:29.930]  and then I think Easter candy that's real dry,
[15:29.930 --> 15:32.290]  has a sugary powdery sort of a smell to it,
[15:32.290 --> 15:33.970]  like a pixie stick,
[15:33.970 --> 15:35.170]  you can smell the powder,
[15:35.170 --> 15:36.970]  and that may sound weird to some people,
[15:36.970 --> 15:40.650]  but I feel like the candy store phenotype of jelly bean,
[15:40.650 --> 15:42.730]  smells like a candy store at the mall,
[15:42.730 --> 15:44.210]  it smells like jelly beans,
[15:44.210 --> 15:46.090]  it smells like powdered candy,
[15:46.090 --> 15:49.010]  and then it's got a hint on the bottom of white grape juice,
[15:49.010 --> 15:51.450]  or maybe peach juice is what I think,
[15:51.450 --> 15:54.610]  and those are very distinct phenotypes that are known,
[15:54.610 --> 15:58.090]  so if you were to buy a 10 pack of jelly bean seeds,
[15:58.090 --> 15:59.330]  and you grew them out,
[15:59.730 --> 16:01.850]  and hopefully you'd get five males and five females,
[16:01.850 --> 16:04.410]  or a ratio somewhere close to 60 40,
[16:04.410 --> 16:07.810]  maybe you got six girls and four boys or the opposite,
[16:07.810 --> 16:08.970]  when you keep flowering them out,
[16:08.970 --> 16:10.490]  you're gonna find one,
[16:10.490 --> 16:11.810]  so you've probably got,
[16:11.810 --> 16:14.490]  we'll say you've got six girls now to flower out,
[16:14.490 --> 16:16.090]  you're probably gonna find one,
[16:16.090 --> 16:18.170]  that is not the desirable phenotype,
[16:18.170 --> 16:19.290]  and then you're probably gonna find one
[16:19.290 --> 16:20.250]  that's the candy store,
[16:20.250 --> 16:22.010]  and you're probably gonna find one,
[16:22.010 --> 16:23.010]  that is the orange pheno,
[16:23.010 --> 16:24.370]  and then you'll have others to play with,
[16:24.370 --> 16:27.250]  that'll be in between and really close and whatnot,
[16:27.250 --> 16:29.010]  but you'll find that if you've got six seeds,
[16:29.690 --> 16:31.410]  I bet you'll find the candy store,
[16:31.410 --> 16:32.890]  and the orange phenotype,
[16:32.890 --> 16:37.650]  so those are really identifiable phenotypes,
[16:37.650 --> 16:40.010]  that you can find in a pack of seeds,
[16:40.010 --> 16:42.050]  I know that when I used to grow a heart of gold,
[16:42.050 --> 16:43.690]  there was the chunky girl phenotype,
[16:43.690 --> 16:44.570]  that I used to look for,
[16:44.570 --> 16:46.010]  and the mean girl phenotype,
[16:46.010 --> 16:47.850]  and then there was the golden goat phenotype,
[16:47.850 --> 16:48.790]  which wasn't my favorite,
[16:48.790 --> 16:50.790]  because it looked just like golden goat,
[16:50.790 --> 16:51.990]  and I'd bred it from golden goat,
[16:51.990 --> 16:54.370]  I didn't wanna reproduce golden goat,
[16:54.370 --> 16:57.610]  so chunky girl just grew big fat chunky buds,
[16:57.610 --> 16:58.450]  they were just chunky,
[16:58.450 --> 16:59.530]  so I called her a chunky girl,
[16:59.530 --> 17:01.210]  she stayed real short and got real chunky,
[17:01.210 --> 17:02.650]  the mean pheno,
[17:02.650 --> 17:04.290]  the buds looked real sharp,
[17:04.290 --> 17:05.930]  and the leaves were real jagged,
[17:05.930 --> 17:07.650]  they were super serrated,
[17:07.650 --> 17:08.810]  they were really long,
[17:08.810 --> 17:09.970]  it just looked mean,
[17:09.970 --> 17:12.350]  like for some reason it looked like an aggressive,
[17:12.350 --> 17:13.190]  like I don't know,
[17:13.190 --> 17:15.650]  it was just the bad guy looking one in the room,
[17:15.650 --> 17:18.250]  it looked like it had attitude in a good way,
[17:18.250 --> 17:20.730]  here's another good example, gorilla glue,
[17:20.730 --> 17:23.590]  there is gorilla glue number four is popular,
[17:23.590 --> 17:26.450]  but also gorilla glue number seven is popular,
[17:26.450 --> 17:28.930]  why do you see different numbers at the end of strains?
[17:28.930 --> 17:32.170]  That's because they were different phenotypes,
[17:32.170 --> 17:35.550]  what happens is a guy like me will grow a pack of seeds,
[17:35.550 --> 17:36.850]  I keep talking about a 10 pack,
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.890]  most breeders sell a five, a 10,
[17:38.890 --> 17:40.210]  or maybe a 12 pack of seeds,
[17:40.210 --> 17:41.850]  I've seen people doing 13s,
[17:41.850 --> 17:42.670]  but anyway,
[17:42.670 --> 17:44.530]  most of the time you run about 10 seeds,
[17:44.530 --> 17:45.970]  that gives you a good ratio,
[17:45.970 --> 17:47.210]  it gives you good numbers to work with
[17:47.210 --> 17:48.230]  if you've got a small grow,
[17:48.230 --> 17:49.090]  if you're a breeder,
[17:49.090 --> 17:50.090]  if you're doing commercial stuff,
[17:50.090 --> 17:52.450]  you wanna go much larger if you've got the opportunity,
[17:52.450 --> 17:53.270]  but what will happen,
[17:53.270 --> 17:54.690]  you'll run 10 seeds,
[17:54.690 --> 17:55.530]  like I said earlier,
[17:55.530 --> 17:58.530]  you're gonna get about a 60-40 ratio of boys to girls,
[17:58.530 --> 18:00.410]  then you're gonna flower the rest,
[18:00.410 --> 18:01.450]  some of the times you do that,
[18:01.450 --> 18:02.570]  one is undesirable,
[18:02.570 --> 18:04.170]  you just cut that fucker down and throw it away,
[18:04.170 --> 18:05.450]  you throw away all the clones,
[18:05.450 --> 18:07.890]  and then you keep your two favorites most of the time,
[18:07.890 --> 18:08.890]  and then you gotta narrow it down
[18:08.890 --> 18:10.370]  from either your two or three favorites
[18:10.370 --> 18:12.210]  to find that best one,
[18:12.210 --> 18:14.850]  however, Josie Wales is the person who bred gorilla glue,
[18:14.850 --> 18:16.610]  I don't know if that was on purpose or an accident,
[18:16.610 --> 18:18.090]  the legend says it was an accident,
[18:18.090 --> 18:19.450]  I'm gonna give the dude credit either way,
[18:19.450 --> 18:20.930]  it's a good fucking strain,
[18:20.930 --> 18:23.650]  he found two good phenotypes out of the seeds that he had,
[18:23.650 --> 18:25.010]  I don't know how many seeds the dude had,
[18:25.450 --> 18:26.410]  he could've had three seeds,
[18:26.410 --> 18:27.570]  or he had at least seven,
[18:27.570 --> 18:29.070]  because there's gorilla glue seven,
[18:29.070 --> 18:30.570]  so he had at least seven seeds,
[18:30.570 --> 18:32.770]  and out of that, number four and number seven
[18:32.770 --> 18:34.250]  were obviously the keepers,
[18:34.250 --> 18:36.890]  he took those and made clones of them,
[18:36.890 --> 18:38.450]  and obviously spread them out,
[18:39.370 --> 18:42.770]  now that's gonna wrap up my rant on phenotypes,
[18:42.770 --> 18:45.650]  and that's gonna segue me into a phrase
[18:45.650 --> 18:48.210]  that is called clone only,
[18:48.210 --> 18:50.590]  somebody asked me what does clone only mean,
[18:50.590 --> 18:54.330]  clone only means that the breeder bred it
[18:54.330 --> 18:56.050]  and never put seeds out of it,
[18:56.050 --> 18:58.650]  and released it in clone form to his friends,
[18:58.650 --> 19:01.970]  or through a forum, or online,
[19:01.970 --> 19:04.210]  or at a cannabis cup, or at a farmer's market,
[19:04.210 --> 19:05.550]  or however it's done,
[19:06.410 --> 19:08.570]  so the breeder just never let out seeds,
[19:08.570 --> 19:09.930]  so it was clone only,
[19:09.930 --> 19:13.410]  because you couldn't get it in any other way,
[19:13.410 --> 19:16.870]  now since cannabis has been so commercialized and legalized,
[19:16.870 --> 19:18.590]  and the revolution is happening,
[19:18.590 --> 19:20.530]  a clone only strain,
[19:20.530 --> 19:21.810]  they're getting adulterated,
[19:21.810 --> 19:24.250]  and they are getting what is called reversed,
[19:25.050 --> 19:27.530]  and they're making seeds from plants
[19:27.530 --> 19:29.850]  that only have a female plant,
[19:29.850 --> 19:31.770]  through asexual breeding,
[19:31.770 --> 19:33.610]  through a process called reversing the plant,
[19:33.610 --> 19:34.890]  so they're taking,
[19:34.890 --> 19:36.010]  let's go with a popular strain
[19:36.010 --> 19:37.470]  that we all know and love around here,
[19:37.470 --> 19:39.350]  let's go with golden goat,
[19:39.350 --> 19:42.530]  golden goat was made by a guy known as Mr. Dank,
[19:42.530 --> 19:43.850]  in Topeka Kansas,
[19:44.890 --> 19:47.170]  Mr. Dank pulled out seeds,
[19:47.170 --> 19:48.490]  so it was an accidental project,
[19:48.490 --> 19:49.330]  this was an accident,
[19:49.330 --> 19:50.730]  which is funny because a lot of the best strains
[19:50.730 --> 19:51.570]  are accidents,
[19:51.570 --> 19:53.450]  I think the gorilla glue was an accident,
[19:53.450 --> 19:55.610]  the golden goat was admittedly an accident,
[19:56.730 --> 19:58.690]  all the chem dog strains were accidents,
[19:58.690 --> 19:59.730]  but let's stick to the point here,
[19:59.730 --> 20:00.810]  golden goat,
[20:00.810 --> 20:03.250]  Mr. Dank accidentally pollinated some plants,
[20:03.250 --> 20:04.570]  he pulled the seeds out,
[20:04.570 --> 20:06.290]  he grew a couple of them,
[20:06.290 --> 20:08.450]  he found golden goat in there,
[20:08.450 --> 20:11.650]  he also found another one that was known as funky bitch,
[20:11.650 --> 20:14.050]  I don't know whatever happened to funky bitch,
[20:14.050 --> 20:16.210]  I've seen funky bitch on shelves,
[20:16.210 --> 20:18.330]  in dispensaries in Denver,
[20:18.330 --> 20:20.130]  but I don't know if that's the cut,
[20:20.130 --> 20:23.570]  because funky bitch is also a song that Phish covers,
[20:23.570 --> 20:24.450]  Phish didn't write that,
[20:24.450 --> 20:25.450]  you guys if you're into Phish,
[20:25.450 --> 20:27.370]  and you think funky bitch is a Phish song,
[20:27.370 --> 20:28.610]  they didn't write that one,
[20:28.610 --> 20:31.530]  but I wanted to name a strain funky bitch after that song,
[20:31.530 --> 20:32.450]  because I fucking love Phish,
[20:32.450 --> 20:33.290]  and I love that song,
[20:33.290 --> 20:34.250]  and I get down,
[20:34.250 --> 20:35.130]  somebody already done it,
[20:35.130 --> 20:36.270]  and then I did research,
[20:36.270 --> 20:38.450]  Mr. Dank is the one that fucking started that name,
[20:38.450 --> 20:40.530]  so he gets the credit,
[20:40.530 --> 20:41.730]  so there was funky bitch,
[20:41.730 --> 20:43.090]  and there was golden goat,
[20:43.090 --> 20:44.290]  he didn't put out any seeds,
[20:44.290 --> 20:45.690]  nobody else got any of those seeds,
[20:45.690 --> 20:47.410]  I don't know if he even grew any more of those,
[20:47.410 --> 20:49.170]  there's no info on that legend,
[20:49.170 --> 20:50.650]  so golden goat happened,
[20:50.650 --> 20:52.690]  golden goat's fucking awesome,
[20:52.690 --> 20:53.510]  he brought,
[20:53.510 --> 20:54.350]  I don't know who did it,
[20:54.350 --> 20:57.090]  somebody brought golden goat from Topeka Kansas,
[20:57.090 --> 20:58.490]  out to Colorado,
[20:58.490 --> 21:00.230]  it got cloned like a motherfucker,
[21:00.230 --> 21:02.730]  and it got put in every dispensary everywhere,
[21:02.730 --> 21:03.570]  I've got it,
[21:03.570 --> 21:04.390]  I breed with it,
[21:04.390 --> 21:05.230]  I love it,
[21:05.230 --> 21:06.490]  golden goat is an awesome plant,
[21:06.490 --> 21:07.330]  golden goat,
[21:07.330 --> 21:09.290]  until I got my dirty little paws on it,
[21:09.290 --> 21:10.970]  was a clone only plant,
[21:10.970 --> 21:12.690]  you couldn't get it any other way,
[21:12.690 --> 21:13.790]  except through a clone,
[21:13.790 --> 21:16.070]  because Mr. Dank would not give out seeds,
[21:16.070 --> 21:17.370]  nobody knows who Mr. Dank is,
[21:17.370 --> 21:18.450]  he kind of lives in the shadows,
[21:18.450 --> 21:20.570]  because he grew weed in Topeka Kansas,
[21:20.570 --> 21:21.610]  so it was clone only,
[21:21.610 --> 21:23.130]  that's what clone only means,
[21:23.130 --> 21:24.290]  it's only a clone,
[21:25.170 --> 21:26.650]  now let's jump forward,
[21:26.650 --> 21:28.770]  where everybody in the world is trying to start,
[21:28.770 --> 21:29.610]  a seed company,
[21:29.610 --> 21:30.810]  and everybody wants to make seeds,
[21:30.810 --> 21:33.150]  and everybody's got their own agenda,
[21:33.150 --> 21:34.210]  I'm guilty,
[21:34.210 --> 21:35.470]  that's why I'm talking shit like I am,
[21:35.470 --> 21:36.650]  I'm part of this crew,
[21:37.970 --> 21:39.390]  people like myself have learned,
[21:39.390 --> 21:41.090]  how to take a female plant,
[21:41.090 --> 21:43.090]  and treat it with a product,
[21:43.090 --> 21:44.990]  and turn it into a boy,
[21:44.990 --> 21:46.630]  now that boy plant,
[21:46.630 --> 21:48.430]  contains all of the chromosomes,
[21:49.270 --> 21:51.230]  of that genotype,
[21:52.350 --> 21:54.630]  but it does not have any male chromosomes,
[21:54.630 --> 21:56.630]  because it's a female plant,
[21:56.630 --> 21:58.530]  you've just stressed it in a way,
[21:58.530 --> 22:01.710]  to produce female parts,
[22:01.710 --> 22:03.110]  and it's going to produce pollen,
[22:03.110 --> 22:05.390]  that has no male chromosomes,
[22:05.390 --> 22:06.830]  I will take that pollen,
[22:06.830 --> 22:09.150]  from that golden goat male,
[22:09.150 --> 22:10.350]  that was a female,
[22:10.350 --> 22:11.430]  it's known as a reversal,
[22:11.430 --> 22:12.650]  and I will put that pollen,
[22:12.650 --> 22:15.270]  onto a true female golden goat,
[22:15.270 --> 22:17.070]  and the seeds that come out of that,
[22:17.070 --> 22:18.250]  the progeny,
[22:18.250 --> 22:20.630]  will be feminized golden goat,
[22:20.630 --> 22:21.790]  R1's,
[22:21.790 --> 22:23.310]  that's a reversed one,
[22:24.670 --> 22:26.290]  some people are going to say it's an S1,
[22:26.290 --> 22:28.030]  Colin and I have been talking about it a lot,
[22:28.030 --> 22:29.270]  we're going to call it an R1,
[22:29.270 --> 22:30.110]  we're sticking to it,
[22:30.110 --> 22:30.930]  that's an R1,
[22:30.930 --> 22:31.770]  it's a reversal,
[22:31.770 --> 22:33.810]  it's our R1 golden goat,
[22:33.810 --> 22:34.770]  all right podcast world,
[22:34.770 --> 22:36.270]  I do need to interrupt myself,
[22:36.270 --> 22:37.890]  and make a quick correction,
[22:37.890 --> 22:38.870]  I said some shit wrong,
[22:38.870 --> 22:39.750]  and I didn't realize it,
[22:39.750 --> 22:42.030]  until I listened back to the podcast,
[22:42.030 --> 22:43.550]  when I take that golden goat plant,
[22:43.550 --> 22:44.390]  and I reverse it,
[22:44.390 --> 22:45.710]  and I put that pollen,
[22:45.710 --> 22:48.310]  back onto the golden goat female,
[22:48.310 --> 22:49.830]  I am actually selfing something,
[22:49.830 --> 22:51.350]  I am making an S1,
[22:51.350 --> 22:53.910]  the first selfed generation,
[22:53.910 --> 22:56.010]  if I take that golden goat pollen,
[22:56.010 --> 22:58.430]  and put it onto a different plant,
[22:58.430 --> 23:00.510]  that is when I am making R1's,
[23:00.510 --> 23:03.410]  which is also known as a reversed F1,
[23:03.410 --> 23:05.190]  so I kind of said that backwards,
[23:05.190 --> 23:06.490]  but here I am correcting it,
[23:06.490 --> 23:08.670]  so let's get back to the current show,
[23:08.670 --> 23:11.670]  so until I put my grubby little paws,
[23:11.670 --> 23:12.950]  on some silver thiosulfate,
[23:12.950 --> 23:13.910]  and my golden goat clones,
[23:13.910 --> 23:16.550]  golden goat was a clone only,
[23:16.550 --> 23:18.250]  so that's what clone only means,
[23:18.250 --> 23:21.750]  now it's really fucking up the medical world,
[23:21.750 --> 23:25.150]  when people are growing seeds of golden goat,
[23:25.150 --> 23:26.590]  and they're finding phenotypes,
[23:26.590 --> 23:30.570]  that lean toward the island sweet skunk Hawaiian side,
[23:30.570 --> 23:31.750]  and then there are phenotypes,
[23:31.750 --> 23:34.510]  that lean toward the Romulan side,
[23:34.510 --> 23:37.370]  and that's people are growing those seeds,
[23:37.370 --> 23:38.730]  and putting them on the shelves,
[23:38.730 --> 23:41.250]  and dispensaries and saying golden goat,
[23:41.250 --> 23:42.590]  and that's kind of,
[23:42.590 --> 23:43.750]  that kind of fucks things up,
[23:43.750 --> 23:45.710]  for people who are expecting golden goat,
[23:45.710 --> 23:48.550]  to be reliable every single time,
[23:48.550 --> 23:49.870]  you hope and you expect,
[23:49.870 --> 23:53.430]  that when you go to dispensary number two,
[23:53.430 --> 23:54.990]  and dispensary number five,
[23:54.990 --> 23:57.110]  and you ask for an eighth of golden goat,
[23:57.110 --> 24:00.250]  you hope it smells, looks, tastes, smokes, burns,
[24:00.250 --> 24:01.350]  and medically affects you,
[24:01.350 --> 24:04.090]  exactly the same from every store,
[24:04.090 --> 24:05.730]  but it's very inconsistent,
[24:05.730 --> 24:07.070]  when people are buying seeds,
[24:07.070 --> 24:08.870]  and finding different phenotypes,
[24:08.870 --> 24:09.830]  and now it's great,
[24:09.830 --> 24:11.630]  I love that people buy seeds,
[24:11.630 --> 24:13.910]  and grow and find different phenotypes,
[24:13.910 --> 24:16.150]  because you may not want,
[24:16.150 --> 24:18.190]  the same phenotype of golden goat,
[24:18.190 --> 24:20.150]  that the next guy wants,
[24:20.150 --> 24:22.350]  but you're gonna want something very similar,
[24:22.350 --> 24:23.510]  but you'll be able to find the one,
[24:23.510 --> 24:25.230]  that grows in your garden the best,
[24:25.230 --> 24:26.790]  that grows to your style the best,
[24:26.790 --> 24:28.870]  that maybe does something,
[24:28.870 --> 24:30.590]  that a lab test wouldn't even pick up,
[24:30.590 --> 24:31.850]  it does it for you medically,
[24:31.850 --> 24:33.510]  maybe when you smoke that one,
[24:33.510 --> 24:35.510]  your diverticulitis chills out,
[24:35.510 --> 24:38.230]  or the pain in your fucking right eye stops twitching,
[24:38.230 --> 24:39.630]  and you there's no way we can see that,
[24:39.630 --> 24:40.510]  with the lab tests,
[24:40.510 --> 24:42.070]  that phenotype may be perfect for you,
[24:42.070 --> 24:44.470]  maybe the other nine feminized seeds,
[24:44.470 --> 24:46.310]  that you grew they don't do that,
[24:46.310 --> 24:47.150]  so that one phenotype,
[24:47.150 --> 24:48.730]  so that's why it's great to grow from seed,
[24:48.730 --> 24:49.830]  but that confuses,
[24:49.830 --> 24:51.950]  that causes confusion in the market,
[24:51.950 --> 24:53.470]  so I'm partly guilty of it,
[24:53.470 --> 24:56.910]  I've kind of stopped making us feminized seeds,
[24:56.910 --> 24:58.030]  partly because of that reason,
[24:58.030 --> 25:01.830]  partly because if we all made feminized seeds,
[25:01.830 --> 25:03.270]  there would be no future of cannabis,
[25:03.270 --> 25:04.950]  it would all be feminized seeds,
[25:04.950 --> 25:07.110]  that's like if we just wiped out all the dudes,
[25:07.110 --> 25:07.990]  it'd just be women,
[25:07.990 --> 25:09.910]  and there'd be no breeding,
[25:10.070 --> 25:12.070]  sorry ladies it's a 50-50 thing,
[25:12.070 --> 25:13.510]  but we need both of them,
[25:13.510 --> 25:15.230]  and I feel cannabis is the same way,
[25:15.230 --> 25:17.550]  so it's my responsibility to kind of make,
[25:17.550 --> 25:18.830]  I try to make two or three times,
[25:18.830 --> 25:20.990]  as many regular seeds as I do femcies,
[25:20.990 --> 25:23.270]  I haven't done feminized seeds in a long time,
[25:23.270 --> 25:25.150]  there's a huge market for them,
[25:25.150 --> 25:26.670]  but I'm getting way off topic here,
[25:26.670 --> 25:29.950]  clone only strains are things like Blue Dream,
[25:29.950 --> 25:30.930]  was a clone only,
[25:32.790 --> 25:34.670]  a lot of the stuff from California,
[25:34.670 --> 25:36.150]  that you hear about from way back in the day,
[25:36.150 --> 25:37.070]  is clone only stuff,
[25:37.070 --> 25:39.310]  the original sour diesel was clone only,
[25:40.230 --> 25:41.990]  there's a lot of great shit that is clone only,
[25:41.990 --> 25:45.310]  Girl Scout cookies was clone only,
[25:45.310 --> 25:46.350]  to the best of my knowledge,
[25:46.350 --> 25:47.830]  Swerve from the Cali Connection,
[25:47.830 --> 25:49.270]  was the first one to put out straight,
[25:49.270 --> 25:51.390]  Girl Scout cookies feminized seeds,
[25:51.390 --> 25:53.510]  so that's a clone only,
[25:53.510 --> 25:54.470]  it was a clone only,
[25:54.470 --> 25:56.430]  the breeder never put out seeds,
[25:56.430 --> 25:57.870]  but then we've kind of adulterated it,
[25:57.870 --> 25:58.790]  and fucked it up,
[25:58.790 --> 26:00.090]  guys like myself,
[26:00.090 --> 26:01.510]  guys like Swerve,
[26:01.510 --> 26:03.590]  were going out and spraying plants with shit,
[26:03.590 --> 26:05.810]  and making feminized seeds and putting it out,
[26:05.810 --> 26:08.090]  I feel like those should be labeled,
[26:08.090 --> 26:09.750]  a little differently when you see them on the shelf,
[26:10.590 --> 26:11.430]  at the dispensary,
[26:11.430 --> 26:12.250]  it should say Golden Goat R,
[26:12.250 --> 26:13.710]  or something like that,
[26:13.710 --> 26:14.590]  so a lot of times guys,
[26:14.590 --> 26:15.430]  if you see,
[26:15.430 --> 26:16.390]  if you go to the dispensary,
[26:16.390 --> 26:18.870]  or if one of your friends gives you a bag of medicine,
[26:18.870 --> 26:21.070]  and it says Screamin' Tangerines number five,
[26:21.070 --> 26:24.150]  or if it says Bounty Killer number six,
[26:24.150 --> 26:24.990]  or something like that,
[26:24.990 --> 26:26.270]  if it says Arise number eight,
[26:26.270 --> 26:28.270]  you guys my Arise number eight is the winner,
[26:28.270 --> 26:29.110]  I've got,
[26:29.110 --> 26:30.710]  I had multiple Arise plants that I went through,
[26:30.710 --> 26:32.510]  I went through a batch of letters,
[26:32.510 --> 26:34.510]  Arise E was the winner out of that one,
[26:34.510 --> 26:36.590]  and then I came across Arise number eight,
[26:36.590 --> 26:38.310]  and then I had Arise number four,
[26:38.310 --> 26:40.230]  and then there was one that I just called Arise,
[26:40.230 --> 26:42.790]  and then it was Arise F1 is how they were labeled,
[26:42.790 --> 26:44.390]  and I just kept running batches of seeds,
[26:44.390 --> 26:45.470]  and batches of seeds,
[26:45.470 --> 26:46.310]  and as I found,
[26:46.310 --> 26:47.470]  if I found one that was better than the last,
[26:47.470 --> 26:48.470]  I would throw the last one away,
[26:48.470 --> 26:49.830]  and keep that best one,
[26:49.830 --> 26:52.550]  but E and eight became the two keepers,
[26:52.550 --> 26:54.950]  and fucking Arise number eight is the champion,
[26:54.950 --> 26:56.590]  so if you see Arise number eight,
[26:56.590 --> 26:58.030]  on a dispensary shelf,
[26:58.030 --> 26:59.630]  or anything anywhere,
[26:59.630 --> 27:01.730]  that is my keeper that I chose,
[27:02.750 --> 27:04.150]  that's my favorite phenotype,
[27:04.150 --> 27:05.950]  so if you see different numbers on the end of a strain,
[27:05.950 --> 27:07.790]  it's probably because a grower,
[27:07.790 --> 27:09.070]  grew multiple of them,
[27:09.070 --> 27:10.750]  and kept the favorite phenotype,
[27:10.750 --> 27:12.430]  if you see two different numbers on the shelf,
[27:12.430 --> 27:13.550]  that's because the grower felt,
[27:13.550 --> 27:14.830]  that those two were worth keeping,
[27:14.830 --> 27:16.710]  and he's probably watching to see,
[27:16.710 --> 27:17.810]  which one come back,
[27:17.810 --> 27:19.610]  which one people come back and buy more of,
[27:19.610 --> 27:21.950]  so he can decide which one to grow more,
[27:21.950 --> 27:23.270]  or he's waiting on the lab test,
[27:23.270 --> 27:25.870]  to decide which one is the best,
[27:26.710 --> 27:29.270]  so just to attach this to the word phenotype,
[27:29.270 --> 27:30.750]  that is called a pheno hunt,
[27:30.750 --> 27:33.270]  if I were to buy a bunch of seeds,
[27:33.270 --> 27:34.110]  and grow them,
[27:34.110 --> 27:35.830]  and try to find the best one that works for me,
[27:35.830 --> 27:36.670]  or find the keeper,
[27:36.670 --> 27:38.670]  that's called a pheno hunt,
[27:38.670 --> 27:41.550]  and that is one of a growers favorite things to do,
[27:41.550 --> 27:42.790]  is to do a fresh pheno hunt,
[27:42.790 --> 27:44.350]  you get to find new shit,
[27:44.350 --> 27:47.150]  you've got the potential to find the next champion,
[27:47.150 --> 27:49.970]  and you may have some shit that nobody else has,
[27:49.970 --> 27:51.870]  so let me wrap up a lot of these glossary terms,
[27:51.870 --> 27:52.790]  in one sentence,
[27:52.790 --> 27:54.270]  let's see,
[27:54.270 --> 27:56.510]  I am going to create a new strain,
[27:56.510 --> 27:59.550]  and I will find my favorite phenotype,
[27:59.550 --> 28:03.230]  and I will pass that one around as a clone only,
[28:03.230 --> 28:05.990]  after I've tossed all of the other seeds,
[28:05.990 --> 28:07.630]  see, if there are no more seeds,
[28:07.630 --> 28:09.010]  that means it's a clone only,
[28:09.010 --> 28:09.850]  right now,
[28:09.850 --> 28:11.270]  space bitch number three,
[28:11.270 --> 28:12.110]  is clone only,
[28:12.110 --> 28:14.230]  there will be no seeds released to anybody but me,
[28:14.230 --> 28:16.230]  I think there's only like five seeds left,
[28:16.230 --> 28:18.070]  so space bitch is a clone only,
[28:18.070 --> 28:20.310]  if you ever get a chance to pick up a space bitch clone,
[28:20.310 --> 28:22.070]  know that that came from me,
[28:22.070 --> 28:23.830]  that was pheno hunted,
[28:23.830 --> 28:25.470]  from my breeding project,
[28:25.470 --> 28:26.290]  all right ladies and gentlemen,
[28:26.290 --> 28:28.350]  I've been going for close to 30 minutes now,
[28:28.350 --> 28:31.110]  I think it's time for me to wrap up episode number 237,

[29:32.510 --> 29:34.550]  if you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[29:34.550 --> 29:37.430]  you can visit patreon.com slash grow from your heart,
[29:37.430 --> 29:39.910]  and you can learn how to financially contribute
[29:39.910 --> 29:40.790]  to the podcast,
[29:40.790 --> 29:42.670]  I'm not trying to get rich off podcasting,
[29:42.670 --> 29:43.590]  I'm doing this for free,
[29:43.590 --> 29:45.290]  this will be free for everybody forever,
[29:45.290 --> 29:48.450]  but if you do want to make a donation or a contribution,
[29:48.450 --> 29:51.450]  you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart,
[29:52.350 --> 29:54.110]  and all of the information will be there,
[29:54.110 --> 29:55.870]  what I'm gonna do with those funds ladies and gentlemen,
[29:55.870 --> 29:58.350]  is I will pay for my web hosting for one year,
[29:58.350 --> 30:01.750]  cost me just a little over $300 to host my website,
[30:01.790 --> 30:03.830]  which is where I host this podcast,
[30:03.830 --> 30:05.190]  so I will use the funds to do that,
[30:05.190 --> 30:07.750]  also I will buy these spiffy little microphone covers,
[30:07.750 --> 30:09.750]  so that I don't have to make the guests spit into the same
[30:09.750 --> 30:11.270]  one over and over again,
[30:11.270 --> 30:13.470]  I usually buy these little quarter inch adapters
[30:13.470 --> 30:15.190]  for the headphones and water bottles and stuff
[30:15.190 --> 30:16.570]  for the guests that come on,
[30:16.570 --> 30:17.670]  but that's what I'll use the funds for,
[30:17.670 --> 30:19.590]  I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting,
[30:19.590 --> 30:21.670]  I know some people out there who are interested
[30:21.670 --> 30:23.430]  in sending some contributions my way,
[30:23.430 --> 30:26.230]  so I made an option for that to be possible,
[30:26.230 --> 30:27.270]  and if you'd like to do it,
[30:27.270 --> 30:28.090]  there it is,
[30:28.090 --> 30:29.450]  all right I'll quit begging that feels weird,
[30:29.450 --> 30:30.470]  don't forget ladies and gentlemen,
[30:30.470 --> 30:32.630]  episodes one through 75,
[30:32.630 --> 30:33.790]  maybe 76,
[30:33.790 --> 30:35.590]  maybe 80 by the time you hear this,
[30:35.590 --> 30:38.070]  are available on YouTube,
[30:38.070 --> 30:39.430]  just go to YouTube and search for the
[30:39.430 --> 30:40.830]  Grow From Your Heart podcast,

[30:43.270 --> 30:44.630]  listen to all those episodes,
[30:44.630 --> 30:45.750]  leave me some comments,
[30:45.750 --> 30:46.890]  let me know what you think,
[30:46.890 --> 30:50.590]  I love interacting with my audience,
[30:50.590 --> 30:51.650]  you know being from Colorado,
[30:51.650 --> 30:53.630]  we do talk a lot of shit about people from Texas,
[30:53.630 --> 30:54.910]  and most of the time we're just joking,
[30:54.910 --> 30:57.830]  so I'm gonna give a huge shout out to everybody
