[01:05.080 --> 01:06.000]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:06.600 --> 01:07.200]  Thanks man.
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.240]  What's up everybody.
[01:08.880 --> 01:09.960]  We are hanging out, bro.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.480]  Are you as freezing as I am?
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.440]  It is a cold fucking Colorado.
[01:13.440 --> 01:14.880]  It's so cold out right now.
[01:15.000 --> 01:15.440]  Oh man.
[01:15.440 --> 01:16.280]  I hate to break it to you.
[01:16.280 --> 01:17.240]  I looked over at the camera.
[01:17.240 --> 01:18.800]  Single digit madness.
[01:18.840 --> 01:19.920]  Yeah, it was seven degrees.
[01:19.920 --> 01:22.920]  Last time I looked, I just, the cameras before we pressed record
[01:22.920 --> 01:24.200]  and you're going to love this update.
[01:24.800 --> 01:26.720]  It's fucking snowing again.
[01:26.720 --> 01:29.000]  We've got at least seven inches out there in the yard.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.680]  It's going to be 10 or 12 inches by the time we wake up this time.
[01:32.520 --> 01:33.440]  I was not prepared.
[01:34.320 --> 01:35.600]  We got like 10 in my yard.
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.320]  At least it's over a foot in a couple of spots.
[01:38.320 --> 01:39.280]  I had to shovel it today.
[01:39.320 --> 01:41.120]  I'm intimately familiar with that snow.
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.360]  Our friend Tony posted a picture of a 16 ounce Mountain Dew bottle, and he posted
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.560]  a timeline over the day of that bottle getting filled up and by the end of the
[01:49.560 --> 01:52.720]  day, it wasn't filled up, it was just stacked up along the side of the bottle.
[01:53.240 --> 01:55.960]  It was about 12 ounces deep by the time of the end of the day.
[01:58.200 --> 01:58.920]  We got pummeled.
[01:59.280 --> 02:02.320]  I haven't seen this much snow in Pueblo since I moved here like a decade ago.
[02:02.520 --> 02:03.600]  Came out of nowhere.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.560]  It came out of nowhere.
[02:04.560 --> 02:06.320]  It was like, Hey, we might get some snow tomorrow.
[02:06.320 --> 02:07.960]  And then it was like, Hey, guess what?
[02:07.960 --> 02:09.320]  Here's all the fucking snow.
[02:09.600 --> 02:11.800]  So yeah, we expected on Halloween.
[02:11.800 --> 02:14.480]  Usually we say Halloween, we're going to get snow here where we live.
[02:15.080 --> 02:17.800]  We are just about a week early.
[02:17.800 --> 02:19.760]  So shout out to mother nature for kicking our ass.
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.440]  I hope you guys got your outdoor plants down on time.
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.960]  That was my first thought is, uh, I know two people that did an outdoor this year
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.800]  and I know they both got out of the ground this week, so they're all, they're
[02:32.800 --> 02:37.040]  all in drying care already, but I'm not, there are a lot of outdoor grows down
[02:37.040 --> 02:37.960]  this part of the state, man.
[02:37.960 --> 02:39.200]  I hope they got out of the ground.
[02:39.520 --> 02:41.720]  So many people growing from here to New Mexico.
[02:41.720 --> 02:43.040]  I know a lot of people growing.
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.720]  I have a friend who had to cancel his weekend plans to just harvest it.
[02:47.640 --> 02:48.480]  So we got pummeled.
[02:48.560 --> 02:49.520]  We were not expecting it.
[02:49.520 --> 02:51.840]  This is not the grow from your weather podcast.
[02:51.840 --> 02:53.080]  This is a cannabis podcast.
[02:53.080 --> 02:55.600]  I just wanted to talk about how freaking cold it is.
[02:55.600 --> 02:58.880]  It is a cold Colorado evening, kind of set the tone for the night.
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.760]  Another great way to set the tone is to talk about what we're smoking.
[03:02.760 --> 03:04.560]  Mike, what are you smoking on this evening, brother?
[03:05.440 --> 03:08.240]  Um, I've been enjoying some local flower.
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.720]  There's a shop in town that had some, I mentioned it the last time I was on the
[03:11.720 --> 03:16.280]  show, some really good golden goat that, uh, I'm enjoying some sensei star from
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.400]  that same shop there.
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.680]  They've been impressive lately.
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.080]  You said so much on the last show that I don't know if anybody remembers or cares
[03:24.080 --> 03:25.920]  about my herb recommendation.
[03:25.920 --> 03:26.120]  Yeah.
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.080]  If you can find some good golden goat, but grab you something real quick.
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.080]  It's delicious.
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.720]  I think we're going to move right on a forward about the last episode you were
[03:33.720 --> 03:33.960]  on.
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.000]  Um, we appreciate the feedback.
[03:37.480 --> 03:39.160]  What are you smoking on these days, buddy?
[03:39.400 --> 03:40.360]  A good toss, buddy.
[03:40.360 --> 03:43.080]  I am smoking some sour best lemons live batter.
[03:43.080 --> 03:45.200]  It's a blend of sour best shit ever.
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.200]  And Northern, uh, lemon tree, Northern lights on the package.
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.400]  They described the flavor as lemons, lemons, and even more lemons.
[03:52.400 --> 03:53.920]  I've talked about this on the podcast.
[03:54.160 --> 03:54.880]  I can agree to it.
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.200]  It's lemon tastic.
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.120]  Those are my friend, my favorite.
[03:58.120 --> 04:00.560]  They work with my, uh, I've got a brain injury.
[04:00.560 --> 04:01.360]  It still exists.
[04:01.360 --> 04:04.320]  It's still, I've got weird lingering fucking fuzzies from it.
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.200]  It was years ago, years ago.
[04:06.200 --> 04:08.200]  If you know the years ago joke, shout out in a fist bump.
[04:08.200 --> 04:11.880]  But years ago, I had a brain injury, some lingering effects.
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.320]  Occasionally I've noticed the lemony limonene type turps kind of correct some
[04:16.320 --> 04:18.280]  of the, in my opinion, I don't know.
[04:18.280 --> 04:21.080]  You may see differently on that from another perspective, but I feel like it
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.160]  kind of fixes my glitches, my skips.
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.800]  Like, uh, if your brain is a fucking record, I've got a little, little skip
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.440]  somewhere and occasionally some songs, it'll just, it'll just, it'll just, and
[04:30.440 --> 04:32.160]  you got to nudge the record player to get it going.
[04:32.160 --> 04:32.880]  That's my brain.
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.880]  I feel like the lemon, it wipes off the scratch on my CD or it fills in the
[04:38.880 --> 04:40.280]  scratch on my record or whatever.
[04:40.280 --> 04:43.200]  And it makes my, uh, my brain flow a little more smoothly.
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.560]  My beats don't have that weird skip.
[04:44.560 --> 04:49.280]  Remember when you would download music from a LimeWire and occasionally
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.680]  fucking boom and boom chat, camp, boom, chat.
[04:52.680 --> 04:55.080]  And then occasionally you're in the middle of the song and you're like, Oh
[04:55.080 --> 04:55.400]  fuck.
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.600]  And you have a little seizure from it.
[04:56.840 --> 04:57.720]  Uh, that's what my brain does.
[04:57.720 --> 04:59.840]  Occasionally you'll hear the beat will be smooth.
[04:59.840 --> 05:03.080]  And then in the middle of the beat, you get just this weird fucked up
[05:03.080 --> 05:04.200]  note that doesn't belong there.
[05:04.320 --> 05:05.920]  This makes those notes go away.
[05:05.920 --> 05:08.640]  This, the lemony turps makes that not happen.
[05:08.640 --> 05:10.680]  So that's where I'm headed with all that bullshit rambles.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.080]  This is your regular advisement to avoid head injuries.
[05:16.400 --> 05:16.680]  Yeah.
[05:16.680 --> 05:19.520]  That's a, that's the first piece of advice is don't bang your head.
[05:19.520 --> 05:22.040]  When at all possible, you should duck.
[05:22.440 --> 05:24.880]  Um, or don't be six foot five.
[05:24.920 --> 05:29.080]  That's what, some of us are just born to smash our faces into things.
[05:29.240 --> 05:31.280]  I was the moving object in that situation.
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.120]  I am to blame.
[05:32.600 --> 05:35.080]  It wasn't like something hit me.
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.320]  Streetlight didn't dive in front of your car.
[05:38.640 --> 05:44.120]  It was, yeah, it was a fucking, I was in a town, an older part of town where, um,
[05:45.080 --> 05:48.200]  there's a word that they use to describe the people, the descendants
[05:48.200 --> 05:49.040]  from this part of the world.
[05:49.040 --> 05:51.640]  I don't know if it's a derogatory term, but they call themselves that here.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.960]  But those people are very short.
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.200]  There are smaller people and the houses here were built for those shorter people.
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.760]  They were five, nine.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.600]  I'm six, five.
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.800]  I think their doorways are six feet tall.
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.040]  Uh, five.
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.360]  I went through that doorway and cracked the top of my head.
[06:05.360 --> 06:06.320]  Oh my God.
[06:06.520 --> 06:09.200]  Knocked myself out and fell down the stairs, slid down the
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.520]  stairs while I was unconscious.
[06:10.800 --> 06:13.240]  I woke up to my friends carrying me up the stairs, wondering what the
[06:13.280 --> 06:14.360]  fuck had just happened to me.
[06:14.800 --> 06:17.640]  Um, so don't be six, five, I guess.
[06:17.800 --> 06:21.200]  Six, five worth of human tunneling down some stairs makes a racket.
[06:21.440 --> 06:23.120]  Just go fuck out anybody in the house.
[06:23.480 --> 06:26.920]  My computer just told me that my internet connection is unstable, Mike.
[06:26.920 --> 06:30.000]  So if things go weird, I'm going to keep recording as business as usual.
[06:30.000 --> 06:30.720]  And we'll catch up.
[06:30.720 --> 06:31.720]  We'll make a good podcast.
[06:31.720 --> 06:33.120]  That sounds good in my headphones.
[06:33.120 --> 06:34.400]  So we'll keep rolling folks.
[06:34.400 --> 06:35.880]  If we lose you, we'll sorry.
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.720]  Got a lot of unstable shit in my life.
[06:37.720 --> 06:38.840]  This internet connection.
[06:41.600 --> 06:43.120]  Welcome to the play internet.
[06:43.520 --> 06:46.000]  I wondered with all the, uh, the snow, if we were going to have any issues,
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.160]  this has been a fun show already, Mike, we're not even to the Patreon shout outs.
[06:49.160 --> 06:51.920]  Let's jump into the part where we give shout outs to the members of the
[06:51.920 --> 06:56.200]  seven 10 club, of course, the seven 10 club or the who support the podcast
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.440]  at the $7 and 10 cent a month level or higher on Patreon.
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.120]  So let's just jump right into it.
[07:02.120 --> 07:05.360]  I want to give a giant shout out and a fist bump to my friend, to Mobius grows.

[09:49.760 --> 09:50.080]  Yes.
[09:50.880 --> 09:51.360]  Um, yeah.
[09:52.080 --> 09:53.880]  Uh, yeah, just one of me here.
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.160]  I got another one, but she's not here.
[09:55.160 --> 09:55.760]  It's easier.
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.960]  Uh, she's 17 year to deal with than the tiny ones.
[09:59.640 --> 09:59.880]  Dude.
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.720]  I can't wait until like long paragraph form explanations
[10:04.720 --> 10:05.960]  will fly with my kids.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.360]  Like they're, they're five and two right now.
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.480]  Like, because I said, so is, is elaborate as I can get without causing confusion.
[10:12.760 --> 10:15.280]  And I just said that there is a 17 year old female in my life.
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.120]  I'd like to clarify that that is my daughter.
[10:17.120 --> 10:18.360]  I just want his daughter.
[10:18.680 --> 10:20.400]  That sounded kind of creepy for a moment there.
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.480]  I'm just going to step in a 17 year old daughters are expensive, but
[10:24.480 --> 10:25.480]  there's just one or her and me.
[10:25.480 --> 10:28.200]  It's not like fucking the tribe that you've got fucking there.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.000]  So yeah.
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.040]  Yeah.
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.520]  Um, and I can explain no expensive.
[10:34.040 --> 10:36.200]  Like you were just saying, I can say, no, that's $900.
[10:36.200 --> 10:36.840]  You can't have that.
[10:36.840 --> 10:38.440]  And your kids are like, but daddy, why?
[10:38.720 --> 10:39.280]  So, yeah.
[10:39.640 --> 10:39.880]  Yeah.
[10:41.000 --> 10:41.440]  Yup.
[10:42.720 --> 10:44.640]  Um, snowed it is their first real snow.
[10:44.640 --> 10:45.520]  So we've been having fun.
[10:45.680 --> 10:46.920]  Oh, that is cool, bro.
[10:46.960 --> 10:47.560]  That is cool.
[10:47.560 --> 10:47.840]  Yeah.
[10:48.240 --> 10:50.720]  Good time for first time for everything with that little one.
[10:50.720 --> 10:51.400]  And that's awesome.
[10:51.840 --> 10:52.360]  Uh, yeah.
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.760]  Uh, the, the, the littlest one, the two year old, uh, first real time in snow.
[10:56.880 --> 11:01.200]  He didn't have gloves on for like five minutes and they came in and we
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.240]  knew it was going to happen, but he lost his mind when those poor
[11:04.240 --> 11:05.520]  little fingers started warming up.
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.880]  That was what my afternoon was right there.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.880]  Like anybody that's got a kid knows how my day went.
[11:12.120 --> 11:12.320]  Yep.
[11:12.320 --> 11:15.320]  They were fun and then they were wet and then they were exhausted.
[11:15.880 --> 11:16.200]  Yup.
[11:16.200 --> 11:20.280]  So a couple of dabs in a podcast seemed like the perfect way to wrap up the day.
[11:20.560 --> 11:20.920]  Okay.
[11:20.960 --> 11:21.120]  Bro.
[11:21.120 --> 11:23.560]  That picture of broccoli that you posted was awesome.
[11:25.280 --> 11:29.400]  I'm impressed for, uh, for the people following along with my COVID garden,
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.400]  the last thing we harvested was a stem of broccoli.
[11:33.400 --> 11:37.080]  The size of my five-year-old's head, literally massive.
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.480]  Basically he carries it.
[11:39.480 --> 11:40.480]  He's like hidden behind.
[11:40.480 --> 11:41.280]  I'm like, where's your boy?
[11:41.320 --> 11:42.440]  I was just walking broccoli.
[11:42.760 --> 11:43.920]  It was like an umbrella.
[11:44.680 --> 11:45.360]  That's yep.
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.160]  He could have fucking lived underneath it if it were a little smaller.
[11:48.400 --> 11:48.640]  All right.
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.120]  We've covered the basics of the, uh, we talked about it being cold.
[11:52.120 --> 11:52.960]  We covered Patreon.
[11:52.960 --> 11:53.720]  We did the commercial.
[11:53.720 --> 11:54.880]  We talked about what we're smoking.
[11:55.120 --> 11:55.880]  Mike is here.
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.360]  I'm here.
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.000]  You guys are here.
[11:57.000 --> 11:57.680]  We're all here.
[11:57.760 --> 11:58.440]  Jeff's here.
[11:58.440 --> 11:59.360]  Y'all don't sweat.
[11:59.800 --> 12:00.920]  I'm more here than usual.
[12:00.920 --> 12:01.720]  This is pretty great.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.840]  Um, I want to give a shout out to new office space.
[12:05.400 --> 12:06.080]  It's got me feeling good.
[12:06.080 --> 12:06.880]  You're focused.
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.600]  It was too cold to do anything today.
[12:08.600 --> 12:09.560]  So I got all this energy.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Um, I want to give a shout out to black sale market.
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.960]  A shout out to Keith, Keith personally.
[12:14.960 --> 12:17.120]  I know it's a company, but Keith is the person that did this.
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.200]  The one that stepped up a few episodes ago, I read an email from a combat
[12:22.200 --> 12:25.720]  veteran who had some money for a grow light and they were a little
[12:25.720 --> 12:27.320]  bit short of a quality light.
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.080]  They probably could have gotten a decent light for their money, but
[12:30.080 --> 12:31.400]  it's the grow from your heart podcast.
[12:31.400 --> 12:32.320]  We don't fuck with decent.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.480]  We fuck with high quality.
[12:33.480 --> 12:35.160]  We want to get the right stuff.
[12:35.400 --> 12:35.600]  Yeah.
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.040]  So, um, I was talking with my friend Keith on the embracing organic show.
[12:39.040 --> 12:41.600]  We had a little hangout after the show, shout out to embracing
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.680]  organics and the whole crew there.
[12:42.680 --> 12:43.800]  But Keith was on there.
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.320]  We were bullshitting a little bit and he's like, Hey, did
[12:45.320 --> 12:46.560]  that veteran ever get a light?
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.240]  And I was like, we got a couple of opportunities and a few options, but
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.320]  I'd love to hear your, what you've got to say, because I work with black sale.
[12:53.320 --> 12:56.440]  I run black sale lights in my, I've got a flower space with black sales.
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.560]  I've got a veg space, a veg space with black sale, cannon lights.
[12:59.840 --> 13:00.320]  And I love them.
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.160]  They work very well.
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.280]  And he looked at me and he goes, bro, I want to give that lady.
[13:04.400 --> 13:08.560]  He said that person, he didn't realize, by the way, that combat veteran is a lady.
[13:08.560 --> 13:11.520]  So all you people that were like, shout out, bro, a shout out, ma'am.
[13:11.520 --> 13:11.840]  Sorry.
[13:11.840 --> 13:12.840]  We got to correct that.
[13:12.840 --> 13:16.120]  That is a lady, a very nice lady to have spoken with them several times.
[13:16.120 --> 13:19.120]  But, uh, Keith was like, I want to give that veteran a light.
[13:19.160 --> 13:20.760]  And I was like, well, here's the info be in touch.
[13:20.760 --> 13:21.920]  And then I put them in touch.
[13:22.280 --> 13:25.800]  And today Keith sent that person a grow light.
[13:25.800 --> 13:27.840]  They've got a cannon on their way.
[13:28.240 --> 13:30.400]  I not to toot my own horn, but they're also going to be growing some
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.560]  irid genetics underneath that cannon led.
[13:32.560 --> 13:33.320]  We got to get them set up.
[13:34.880 --> 13:35.080]  Yeah.
[13:35.080 --> 13:36.280]  So shout out to Keith.
[13:36.280 --> 13:38.360]  He stepped up, uh, sent them a cannon.
[13:38.560 --> 13:41.000]  We let them keep the money that they had in the episode.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.200]  They said that they had a little bit of money for a grow light.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.520]  We didn't even ask for that funding.
[13:45.520 --> 13:46.520]  We let them keep that.
[13:46.520 --> 13:50.640]  Maybe they can get some nice or some soil or some nudes or some power bill
[13:50.640 --> 13:53.600]  or always more to be covered when it comes to building a grow.
[13:53.600 --> 13:54.520]  So shout out to Keith.
[13:54.720 --> 13:56.560]  Uh, Keith is also a veteran.
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.600]  Uh, he is, uh, uh, but I fucking, I should remember the branch of military.
[14:00.600 --> 14:02.200]  He's from, I feel disrespectful now.
[14:02.560 --> 14:04.480]  Uh, but, uh, that doesn't stick in my brain.
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.520]  I've got this weird brain injury.
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.840]  Some things go, some things don't.
[14:06.840 --> 14:09.920]  And that was the one that didn't, I'm sorry, but I at least respect him
[14:09.920 --> 14:11.040]  and remember that he's a soldier.
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.480]  So, uh, when he realized it was a soldier, he definitely felt, uh, some
[14:15.480 --> 14:16.840]  compassion and wanted to help out.
[14:17.760 --> 14:18.040]  Yeah.
[14:18.480 --> 14:18.680]  Yeah.
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.440]  So a soldier helping a soldier, uh, disabled person has been helped by a well,
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.800]  a younger fucking person.
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.000]  Keith is a young, healthy dude.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.800]  So it's really good to see something like that.
[14:26.800 --> 14:27.960]  We got people helping people.
[14:27.960 --> 14:29.440]  The podcast brought people together.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.320]  That doesn't mean we have to stop.
[14:31.720 --> 14:33.960]  Uh, there are other veterans out there that need lights.
[14:34.280 --> 14:35.800]  It is terrible that we have to do this.
[14:36.280 --> 14:39.640]  If you are a veteran in desperate need of a light, I know another person who has
[14:39.640 --> 14:42.280]  offered, there are several other people who have offered lights, they've got
[14:42.280 --> 14:44.280]  leftover lights laying around that are still usable.
[14:44.280 --> 14:48.040]  There's a guy that you and I know very well who offered brand new grow lights.
[14:48.040 --> 14:50.000]  And I want to get those two veterans that need them.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.520]  I hate that I have to do it this way.
[14:51.520 --> 14:53.760]  I would like you to kind of verify that you're a veteran.
[14:53.760 --> 14:54.760]  I don't know how to do that.
[14:54.760 --> 14:57.480]  Keith knew how to do it because he said, as soon as he spoke to another
[14:57.480 --> 14:58.600]  veteran, they would know.
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.560]  Uh, yeah, it's, it's like, if you don't know calculus, like you can't, it's
[15:03.560 --> 15:05.320]  something you can fake for more than a minute.
[15:05.520 --> 15:05.800]  Yeah.
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.080]  Like I know bros and I, when bros and I talk, we're bro, bro.
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.680]  And we bro out bro, but veterans, I don't know, veteran lingo and I
[15:11.680 --> 15:14.440]  couldn't catch it, but we need to vet these vets a little bit and make sure
[15:14.440 --> 15:18.440]  they're actually, because I hate to say it nowadays, people are not completely
[15:18.440 --> 15:20.040]  fucking on the whole world's belt.
[15:20.040 --> 15:20.560]  Got tight.
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.000]  Yeah.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.080]  Everybody's up in their scam game.
[15:23.360 --> 15:23.560]  Yep.
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.680]  It could be, it could be someone in a totally different country telling me
[15:26.680 --> 15:29.240]  that there's somebody that they're totally not trying to get free shit out of me.
[15:29.480 --> 15:31.920]  It's terrible that the world is that way that I even have to question
[15:31.920 --> 15:34.640]  somebody's claim that they're a veteran, but we need to vet a couple of people.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.120]  I would like to find a couple of people who are deserving and in need of some
[15:39.120 --> 15:41.400]  grow lights and the people that have offered to give out these lights.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.080]  And I told you, we got the one taken care of.
[15:43.280 --> 15:44.840]  This is where you guys are going to come into play.
[15:44.840 --> 15:45.320]  Thank you.
[15:45.320 --> 15:46.240]  I appreciate you.
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.880]  It's really cool that, um, I love that I can have this pool.
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.520]  I, all I did was talk into the mic.
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.960]  A bunch of people sent messages saying I have got
[15:54.960 --> 15:56.240]  equipment for these veterans.
[15:56.240 --> 15:58.280]  I love that we can create that sort of a community.
[15:58.280 --> 15:59.120]  Thank you guys.
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.120]  Uh, thank you so much guys.
[16:01.200 --> 16:04.280]  Everybody gals, literally everybody that's reached out.
[16:04.320 --> 16:05.440]  Thank you very much.
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.520]  Uh, the veterans that are going to get these lights and free
[16:08.520 --> 16:09.560]  seeds, definitely.
[16:09.560 --> 16:10.480]  Thank you very much.
[16:10.480 --> 16:12.760]  And I have another good friend with the nutrient company.
[16:12.760 --> 16:15.120]  We're going to see if maybe we can get some boxes of nutrients out to
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.280]  these people at the same time, uh, if they're running on the addicts, the
[16:18.280 --> 16:21.560]  nutrients I recommend and the lights that I recommend, they're set up for
[16:21.560 --> 16:23.080]  success and we'll get them taken care of.
[16:23.080 --> 16:25.400]  These people are blowed up and have PTSD.
[16:25.400 --> 16:29.000]  We've got to take care of the people that, uh, I don't even, I'm not a person.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.320]  I'm not for wool, but people had to do it and it's not his, his or her fault.
[16:33.320 --> 16:35.240]  That they can, so we got to help them.
[16:35.400 --> 16:36.720]  Like they're all family to us.
[16:36.720 --> 16:37.360]  We've got to pick them up.
[16:37.360 --> 16:38.960]  They're now they're fucking iry army.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  They're not only us army or us Marines are iry army.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.800]  Now it's our turn to take care of them.
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.800]  Uh, no soldier left behind here in the iry army, the iry army.
[16:48.800 --> 16:52.200]  We do more dabs before 9am than you do all day, bro.
[16:53.440 --> 16:54.080]  But shout out to Keith.
[16:54.080 --> 16:57.960]  I want to, I'm so, so pumped with how the community came together for this one.
[16:57.960 --> 16:58.920]  This is huge.
[16:58.920 --> 17:00.080]  Y'all thank you so much.
[17:00.280 --> 17:03.880]  It feels good that I don't like to think that I did that, bro.
[17:03.880 --> 17:06.080]  But I mean, it feels good that we did that, bro.
[17:06.080 --> 17:08.720]  Like I, I, and then people stepped up.
[17:08.720 --> 17:09.600]  All I did was say stuff.
[17:09.600 --> 17:12.400]  I talked into this mic that goes into a box that goes to the internet.
[17:12.680 --> 17:15.080]  And then people were like people in need will work people that help.
[17:15.080 --> 17:16.360]  So that's fucking cool.
[17:16.360 --> 17:17.440]  That's growing from your heart.
[17:17.440 --> 17:17.720]  You guys.
[17:17.720 --> 17:18.160]  Thank you.
[17:19.440 --> 17:20.160]  Talk a lot of shit.
[17:20.160 --> 17:20.880]  I giggle a lot.
[17:20.880 --> 17:22.400]  I tell a lot of jokes, but thank you.
[17:22.440 --> 17:23.200]  This one's serious.
[17:23.800 --> 17:26.080]  Um, where else are we going to go?
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.080]  We briefly glossed over this one a moment ago, but I want to go back to it.
[17:30.160 --> 17:31.520]  I want to send a big thank you.
[17:31.520 --> 17:36.760]  Shout out to everybody who sent a comment or a message or an email or any sort of
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.400]  feedback or reply to episode 579.
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.920]  I feel like Mike did a very good job.
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.040]  It was very well spoken, very well put together the past two shows.
[17:45.040 --> 17:46.000]  You've been on X pro.
[17:46.480 --> 17:47.200]  Awesome, bro.
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.160]  Um, I appreciate you.
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.280]  I appreciate what you're saying.
[17:50.520 --> 17:52.880]  People don't have to agree with us a hundred percent.
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.560]  There are adult ways and non-adult ways to go about agreeing and not agreeing.
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.840]  Shout out to everybody who replied in an adult manner, if you agreed or not.
[18:01.920 --> 18:04.480]  And that's, as far as I'm going to go with that, we don't need to address anything
[18:04.480 --> 18:04.680]  else.
[18:04.680 --> 18:06.720]  I think we gave everybody a shout out that deserves it.
[18:06.880 --> 18:07.480]  Thank you, Mike.
[18:07.480 --> 18:08.440]  You did a wonderful job.
[18:08.680 --> 18:09.600]  Always welcome back.
[18:10.040 --> 18:11.760]  No matter what the YouTube comments say.
[18:12.320 --> 18:12.840]  Oh, dude.
[18:12.840 --> 18:13.440]  Appreciate it.
[18:13.440 --> 18:13.640]  Yeah.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.480]  People suck on the internet sometimes.
[18:15.480 --> 18:15.840]  That's all.
[18:15.960 --> 18:16.360]  It's cool.
[18:16.680 --> 18:17.080]  Don't read.
[18:17.960 --> 18:18.880]  Don't read the comments.
[18:18.880 --> 18:19.840]  I read the comments.
[18:19.840 --> 18:20.840]  My skin is thick.
[18:20.840 --> 18:21.480]  I ain't worried.
[18:21.880 --> 18:24.480]  I check them on YouTube because I'm the host and producer of the show.
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.560]  I want some feedback, but, uh, I don't, I try to avoid the comments.
[18:28.560 --> 18:29.240]  It's not healthy.
[18:29.520 --> 18:30.480]  Like, Oh bro.
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.320]  We're so blessed.
[18:31.320 --> 18:35.480]  Like it's one of the reasons why I'm so pumped that the community was able to help
[18:35.480 --> 18:35.760]  out.
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.000]  Um, the vet that that's been doing emails with the show and get some lights out.
[18:41.760 --> 18:46.320]  Um, to a handful of people now it's, it's so cool that we can give back.
[18:46.320 --> 18:47.400]  Like we're so blessed.
[18:47.400 --> 18:50.800]  Like we live in the U S we're white males.
[18:50.840 --> 18:53.000]  Like no one's hunting us for sport.
[18:53.480 --> 18:54.720]  Like life is good, man.
[18:55.160 --> 18:58.000]  If I didn't have red locks, I'd be, yeah.
[18:58.040 --> 19:00.800]  The cops wouldn't even fucking herbs legal here.
[19:00.880 --> 19:03.280]  Like life is good.
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.720]  And we're, we're, we're fortunate.
[19:05.720 --> 19:08.040]  And to be able to give back is great.
[19:08.040 --> 19:11.440]  Like people being rude on the internet, like, Oh, please.
[19:12.840 --> 19:16.160]  I avoid most of somebody say get better shade from my toddler.
[19:16.480 --> 19:16.800]  Right.
[19:16.920 --> 19:20.640]  Somebody asked if I had noticed the negative comment on iTunes and I was like,
[19:20.640 --> 19:21.040]  the what?
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.480]  Because I know, uh, I know what content I'm putting out.
[19:26.480 --> 19:28.120]  I'm not going to be a different person.
[19:28.120 --> 19:30.760]  It's not going to be a different show because somebody says, here's Shelly socks.
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.080]  Go listen to the other free cannabis podcasts out there.
[19:34.080 --> 19:36.560]  If you don't like mine anyway, we've given them an attention.
[19:36.680 --> 19:37.200]  Thank you, Mike.
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.480]  I thought you did a wonderful job.
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.120]  I also want to send a shout out to everybody who hangs out in the premieres.
[19:42.560 --> 19:45.040]  Uh, I do the premieres of the show at midnight.
[19:45.080 --> 19:48.200]  Uh, if it's the show comes out on Monday morning and Thursday morning.
[19:48.200 --> 19:50.920]  So it's 12 o'clock Monday, 12 o'clock Thursday.
[19:51.040 --> 19:51.440]  Thank you.
[19:51.440 --> 19:52.480]  Those premieres are fun.
[19:52.480 --> 19:54.480]  We're getting more and more people in there every time.
[19:54.760 --> 19:55.600]  It's a fun chat.
[19:56.520 --> 19:58.000]  I don't have a loud chat sesh.
[19:58.800 --> 20:00.440]  I may not come in, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[20:00.480 --> 20:01.800]  I may not comment a whole lot.
[20:01.840 --> 20:02.920]  Both got dabbed throat.
[20:02.920 --> 20:03.240]  Sorry.
[20:03.240 --> 20:05.360]  Y'all right at the same time for both of us too.
[20:05.920 --> 20:06.760]  I am lurking though.
[20:06.760 --> 20:09.840]  If I'm not commenting, I'm lurking, watching the comments, watching you guys
[20:09.840 --> 20:10.880]  chat, and it's a good time.
[20:10.880 --> 20:11.240]  Thank you.
[20:11.240 --> 20:11.800]  I enjoy it.
[20:12.160 --> 20:15.800]  The funnest part is, uh, we do our chat there on the premier.
[20:15.800 --> 20:18.600]  You and I hung out last night and left some comments and chatted with the people.
[20:19.120 --> 20:21.520]  As soon as it ended, I was like, well, now what am I going to do?
[20:21.640 --> 20:24.400]  I clicked over to watch Eagle because Eagle gardens was live.
[20:24.800 --> 20:27.600]  Everybody from the chat just migrated right over to Eagle and we all
[20:27.600 --> 20:29.000]  went to Eagle together.
[20:29.320 --> 20:30.280]  So shout out to each one.
[20:30.680 --> 20:31.320]  That was fucking cool.
[20:31.320 --> 20:33.600]  Shout out to everybody that's been on Eagle lately.
[20:33.600 --> 20:34.560]  You guys are killing it.
[20:34.680 --> 20:37.400]  If you're not watching Eagle gardens, the name of the show is
[20:37.400 --> 20:39.080]  fucking talking shit with Eagle.
[20:39.440 --> 20:40.880]  Uh, it's on right now.
[20:41.040 --> 20:43.680]  I don't know what time you're listening to this, where you're watching.
[20:44.280 --> 20:45.400]  It's on the dude.
[20:45.400 --> 20:46.720]  Fucking doesn't log out of YouTube.
[20:46.760 --> 20:48.000]  I love him and respect him.
[20:48.480 --> 20:51.160]  Uh, one day he's going to need a fucking break and like, I'm proud of him.
[20:51.160 --> 20:51.600]  I'm excited.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.400]  He's gone the entire time of COVID.
[20:55.720 --> 20:58.960]  Uh, the entire time that the quarantine and COVID situation has been happening.
[20:58.960 --> 21:01.320]  He has not missed a single night of podcasting.
[21:01.640 --> 21:03.640]  They do at least an hour or three.
[21:04.720 --> 21:07.440]  He'll have a guest on like you and I do, and he'll interview the guest
[21:07.440 --> 21:09.840]  and then he'll wrap it up and it'd be like, I'll be back in two minutes, guys.
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.560]  And I'm pretty sure he goes and takes a piss and gets a drink and comes back
[21:12.840 --> 21:16.240]  and he does the rabbit hole and that's just whatever we're just going to talk
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.640]  about, whatever, go down the rabbit hole.
[21:17.640 --> 21:19.480]  And that goes until I fall asleep, dude.
[21:19.480 --> 21:23.000]  I never am able to end that show because they go forever.
[21:23.160 --> 21:23.720]  They go forever.
[21:23.720 --> 21:25.400]  So shout out to Eagle for keeping us entertained.
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.200]  Shout out to everybody putting out.
[21:27.680 --> 21:29.080]  All of this amazing content.
[21:29.240 --> 21:31.240]  When quarantine happened, people got stressed out.
[21:31.240 --> 21:32.560]  We didn't know what we were going to do.
[21:32.920 --> 21:35.480]  Uh, content providers have stepped the fuck up.
[21:35.480 --> 21:40.680]  I'm a consumer being self-employed and I basically live alone.
[21:40.680 --> 21:41.680]  I'm here by myself.
[21:41.720 --> 21:43.840]  90% of the time I'm hanging out.
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.520]  I've got Joey Diaz or Rogan in my ear, but a lot of the time I got Eagle gardens.
[21:48.520 --> 21:49.480]  I got Fumidor.
[21:49.720 --> 21:51.760]  I got all those guys that are our local friends.
[21:51.760 --> 21:52.840]  I've got them on the YouTube.
[21:52.840 --> 21:53.440]  I'm watching them.
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.160]  It's really cool.
[21:54.280 --> 21:55.880]  I've made a lot of cool friends through it too.
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.320]  So I'm not just on both sides of the screen, people that are on the shows.
[21:59.320 --> 22:00.680]  I'm friend, new friends with them.
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.160]  Um, family tree seeds, Cascadian grown, made friends with those guys
[22:05.160 --> 22:06.360]  through these kinds of shows.
[22:06.360 --> 22:09.880]  Also the audience, I've become really close with them over the COVID times.
[22:10.640 --> 22:11.280]  So shout out to them.
[22:11.280 --> 22:14.880]  I've gotten to chat and interact with a lot more viewers and listeners lately.
[22:15.200 --> 22:15.560]  Yeah.
[22:15.840 --> 22:17.560]  That's stepped away up the last couple of months.
[22:17.920 --> 22:18.480]  We've got time.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.840]  Thanks for reaching out to everybody.
[22:20.160 --> 22:20.440]  Yeah.
[22:20.720 --> 22:24.240]  Not only do we provide you guys content, but you guys recharge us.
[22:24.240 --> 22:26.640]  I say that you guys are like nutrients and recharge for us.
[22:26.640 --> 22:27.720]  We put these shows together.
[22:28.040 --> 22:29.280]  It doesn't seem like a lot of work.
[22:29.280 --> 22:30.920]  I had to learn equipment.
[22:30.920 --> 22:33.200]  I had a little tech issue fucking before we recorded here that
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.120]  had me scratching my head.
[22:34.360 --> 22:37.240]  I got to figure it out and we're going, but, and it took us a few
[22:37.240 --> 22:38.600]  minutes to write a podcast together.
[22:38.600 --> 22:40.720]  It's not all just fucking press record and go.
[22:40.720 --> 22:41.480]  You gotta have a plan.
[22:41.480 --> 22:42.240]  You gotta have a plot.
[22:42.240 --> 22:43.040]  You gotta know what you're doing.
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.280]  It's got to go to the internet.
[22:45.600 --> 22:48.280]  Sometimes it depends on what show I'm on.
[22:48.640 --> 22:51.120]  Uh, some shows we just fucking press go and hope for the best.
[22:51.720 --> 22:54.880]  But, uh, I don't even remember where the fuck I was, but yeah, we've had a lot
[22:54.880 --> 22:56.880]  more interaction time because of this COVID time.
[22:56.880 --> 22:57.560]  So thank you guys.
[22:57.560 --> 23:01.160]  It's recharging us all the feedback, uh, everybody that's been putting out great
[23:01.160 --> 23:04.080]  content, you keep me going, uh, the people that join us in the premieres.
[23:04.320 --> 23:05.280]  It has been really fun.
[23:05.280 --> 23:10.280]  I was worried about, uh, the possible depression with COVID times, especially,
[23:10.680 --> 23:12.680]  uh, and we didn't get a summer to play.
[23:13.040 --> 23:14.440]  That's like what recharge rain.
[23:14.440 --> 23:15.760]  And then it got dark and gloomy.
[23:16.120 --> 23:18.960]  And some people, myself included, I can get bummed out in these
[23:18.960 --> 23:20.280]  cold fucking depressed times.
[23:20.280 --> 23:21.560]  I'm from California, bro.
[23:21.840 --> 23:23.640]  I'm from sunshine and beaches and shit.
[23:23.640 --> 23:25.560]  And you brought me to this cold, snowy shit.
[23:25.960 --> 23:28.440]  It's hard for my brain to go, but I want to go outside and play.
[23:28.440 --> 23:29.320]  I need vitamin D.
[23:29.320 --> 23:30.600]  And it's like, no, it's cold and shitty.
[23:30.600 --> 23:31.440]  You've got to hibernate.
[23:31.800 --> 23:34.720]  And it makes me, I don't know if it's depressed or what, but it's a feeling.
[23:35.360 --> 23:38.520]  Do people are basically complex house plants with emotions.
[23:38.520 --> 23:40.600]  Like you need water and you need sunlight.
[23:41.760 --> 23:44.760]  If you take one of those away, the human ain't going to do so hot.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.720]  My opportunity for sunlight was about four hours today and it was
[23:47.720 --> 23:49.240]  seven degrees during that window.
[23:49.240 --> 23:50.720]  So it wasn't enjoying sunlight.
[23:50.720 --> 23:54.160]  It was outside working a snow shovel during that period, but my shoulders.
[23:54.960 --> 23:55.280]  Yeah.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.760]  It was not awesome.
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.240]  I would have tipped you fat to shovel my shit, but all of the people making
[24:01.240 --> 24:05.080]  the content, interacting, listening, participating, Patrioning, uh, they
[24:05.080 --> 24:06.640]  are keeping myself sane.
[24:06.920 --> 24:09.720]  Uh, my Instagram live audience helps keep me sane.
[24:10.040 --> 24:14.160]  I hung out an hour and several, like an hour and a half today on Instagram
[24:14.160 --> 24:15.280]  live, and that was a good time.
[24:15.520 --> 24:17.200]  Uh, that's like social interaction.
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.760]  And then the best part is you don't have to kick them out when you're done.
[24:19.760 --> 24:22.360]  You don't have to be like, all right, guys, I need to poop and get some food.
[24:22.360 --> 24:23.120]  You need to leave now.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.040]  You're like, all right, I'm done.
[24:24.160 --> 24:24.520]  Click.
[24:24.840 --> 24:25.840]  They're fucking they're out.
[24:25.880 --> 24:26.440]  It's over.
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.360]  They couldn't fucking linger if they wanted to.
[24:28.360 --> 24:30.240]  You don't have to kick any stone people off the couch.
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.000]  No, it's too fucking high to drive home.
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.120]  It's fucking awesome.
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.280]  So cozy, but thank you guys.
[24:35.480 --> 24:36.640]  I know I'm off on a ramble today.
[24:36.640 --> 24:37.800]  That lemon dab got me going.
[24:37.800 --> 24:39.400]  It's kind of a fun podcast episode.
[24:39.880 --> 24:42.160]  Uh, but really all of the interaction, all that support.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.280]  I've had a lot of fun.
[24:43.560 --> 24:45.640]  I know it's been a podcast filled with shout outs.
[24:45.640 --> 24:47.440]  We've been going for almost 25 minutes here.
[24:47.840 --> 24:50.120]  Uh, haven't really done a lot of cannabis related content.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.960]  After the last show that we did, people are, there's a couple of people out
[24:54.960 --> 24:58.680]  there with their cheeks clenched, wonder which direction the show's going to turn.
[24:58.840 --> 24:58.960]  Yeah.
[24:58.960 --> 25:00.400]  And I think it's going to be rambles.
[25:00.400 --> 25:01.840]  Are they going to do cannabis stuff?
[25:01.840 --> 25:04.040]  Is Mike going to do another politics rant?
[25:04.440 --> 25:06.160]  I think it's just going to be going to happen.
[25:06.800 --> 25:09.200]  And, uh, us getting your audience back.
[25:09.680 --> 25:12.480]  I feel like I may have lost a couple of people because that last episode,
[25:12.480 --> 25:14.600]  honestly, we lost the right people.
[25:14.880 --> 25:15.320]  It's fine.
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.360]  That's the thing about people who jump off the boat.
[25:18.360 --> 25:20.160]  Like they clearly didn't want to be here.
[25:20.600 --> 25:25.200]  If y'all made it to the 570 sub episodes and hadn't realized that I was a liberals,
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.560]  liberal, liberal, y'all ain't been listening.
[25:27.960 --> 25:29.000]  All right, let's pull this one back.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.240]  We're getting into that water again.
[25:30.560 --> 25:31.160]  No, no.
[25:31.200 --> 25:31.440]  Yeah.
[25:31.440 --> 25:32.600]  No, the show has a point.
[25:32.600 --> 25:33.920]  We're not doing politics tonight.
[25:33.920 --> 25:36.440]  Y'all it's just, it's been a fun, what?
[25:36.440 --> 25:37.520]  72 hours.
[25:37.960 --> 25:38.240]  Yeah.
[25:38.400 --> 25:40.160]  Uh, we're just enjoying the ride.
[25:40.560 --> 25:42.240]  And posted and then got back together.
[25:42.400 --> 25:44.520]  Well, the show has only been out for 12 hours at this point.
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.200]  Uh, 24 hours now while we're recording the show has been out for
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.520]  24 hours and I, you check them with Thunderdome bitches.
[25:52.640 --> 25:55.120]  There were seven comments before we recorded.
[25:56.280 --> 25:57.400]  Oh, so good.
[25:57.840 --> 26:00.600]  I had 200 and something emails when I woke up today.
[26:00.640 --> 26:03.720]  Most of them were comments and emails about the show.
[26:03.760 --> 26:04.520]  So that was interesting.
[26:04.720 --> 26:04.920]  All right.
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.400]  So I know that we're doing a bunch of shout outs.
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.000]  It hasn't, we haven't done any cannabis content, probably not going to do any
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.240]  cannabis content on this episode.
[26:10.240 --> 26:11.400]  We're going to hang out and have a good time.
[26:11.400 --> 26:13.240]  Cause Mike and I wanted to catch up and hang out.
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.040]  We missed you guys.
[26:14.040 --> 26:14.800]  Mike missed you guys.
[26:14.800 --> 26:16.120]  Mike had some free time, honestly.
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.280]  Um, but I do have a giant shout out to my friend Buzz Bros.
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.680]  Uh, make sure you follow Buzz Bros on Instagram.
[26:23.680 --> 26:26.080]  It's just like, it sounds B U Z B R O S.
[26:26.080 --> 26:27.560]  Give them a follow, give them a shout out.
[26:27.920 --> 26:31.480]  Uh, that nice guy has rebuilt my website.
[26:31.480 --> 26:31.840]  That's right.
[26:31.840 --> 26:33.960]  I've complained about my website for quite a while.
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.480]  Uh, the new website is iRegenetics.com.
[26:37.480 --> 26:39.400]  It used to have Colorado at the end of it.
[26:39.640 --> 26:42.360]  We're going to convert everything to the new website.
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.880]  iRegenetics.com.
[26:44.160 --> 26:45.440]  I'm excited about the build.
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.320]  It looks really good.
[26:46.320 --> 26:48.560]  Now we're putting, uh, we're sprucing it up.
[26:48.560 --> 26:49.320]  It's got the outline.
[26:49.320 --> 26:50.800]  The framework is in place.
[26:51.120 --> 26:53.120]  I'm going to do a lot of work on that over the next week.
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.360]  He gave me a three week deadline about two weeks ago, and he's
[26:57.360 --> 26:58.960]  already way ahead of schedule.
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.000]  I'm excited.
[27:00.000 --> 27:00.560]  I'm impressed.
[27:00.560 --> 27:01.400]  I'm pleased with what he's doing.
[27:01.400 --> 27:03.160]  It looks really good so far.
[27:03.320 --> 27:03.760]  Thank you, bro.
[27:03.760 --> 27:05.920]  We scroll through it for a couple of moments here before the show.
[27:06.200 --> 27:08.760]  Uh, I go looking for errors and things that we need to correct and
[27:08.760 --> 27:09.800]  update when I get a moment.
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.280]  And I'm really excited with the way that the website has evolved.
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.840]  So you guys, if you were looking for anything, iRegenetics related, sometimes
[27:16.840 --> 27:20.000]  I talk about my genetics, where to buy the genetics, where to buy t-shirts,
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.200]  how to join us on Patreon, how to listen to the podcast, how to contact me.
[27:24.600 --> 27:25.640]  One location.
[27:25.800 --> 27:28.120]  There's no more of the scrambling around bullshit.
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.960]  My email is this, my website's here.
[27:29.960 --> 27:30.920]  Patreon's here.
[27:31.400 --> 27:33.120]  Uh, it is all in one location.
[27:33.160 --> 27:35.520]  It is all iRegenetics.com.
[27:36.240 --> 27:37.800]  I like our connections, Wave Room buddy.
[27:37.800 --> 27:40.320]  Your, your voice just went all Ewokie.
[27:40.760 --> 27:41.080]  All right.
[27:41.080 --> 27:44.040]  As long as it is recording properly in one of our devices, I've
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.440]  got two recording devices here.
[27:45.720 --> 27:47.120]  Uh, we'll make that work, but thank you.
[27:47.120 --> 27:49.760]  By the way, when I saw your face, I definitely knew that it was spot for an edit.
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.000]  We'll just have to double listen.
[27:51.080 --> 27:51.760]  Sorry, folks.
[27:52.080 --> 27:52.200]  Yeah.
[27:52.200 --> 27:53.280]  We may not even take that out.
[27:53.280 --> 27:55.360]  They may get to see that little behind the scenes part.
[27:55.560 --> 27:57.000]  Uh, it's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[27:57.320 --> 27:59.240]  It's a six degrees outside.
[27:59.800 --> 28:01.200]  We're liable to get some tech issues.
[28:02.040 --> 28:04.920]  I think the first time we tried one of these Zoom podcasts, I
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.360]  call it a bunker session.
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.240]  And it feels more and more like that every, every time we do one.
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.520]  But I think we got the technology figured out mostly.
[28:13.520 --> 28:16.160]  Hopefully I sound really good in everybody's ears this week.
[28:16.880 --> 28:19.800]  Um, there's a new piece of tech that should be bringing my volume up.
[28:20.200 --> 28:20.920]  Learned some time.
[28:20.920 --> 28:21.280]  Yeah.
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.280]  It's snowing like a beast outside and we can't do anything
[28:25.280 --> 28:26.400]  about the internet connection.
[28:26.400 --> 28:28.200]  So we're trying folks.
[28:28.200 --> 28:28.760]  We really are.
[28:29.120 --> 28:29.920]  Oh, we're having fun though.
[28:29.960 --> 28:30.880]  We are having fun.
[28:30.960 --> 28:35.160]  I think everybody that's the, that listens to the show really likes the,
[28:35.520 --> 28:36.960]  the content we've been putting out.
[28:37.320 --> 28:38.560]  Cause your show has been crushing it.
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.480]  The grow episodes been so good lately.
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.240]  Thank you, bro.
[28:41.240 --> 28:42.560]  And it's only going to get better.
[28:42.560 --> 28:44.120]  I keep teasing stuff that's coming along.
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.080]  I've made a couple of hints of things that may happen.
[28:46.280 --> 28:49.840]  Uh, thank you for the compliments, but I know we can do better and it is time.
[28:49.840 --> 28:51.200]  Things are all in place.
[28:51.640 --> 28:54.480]  Um, I don't want to talk too much about it here because I just want to say
[28:54.480 --> 28:57.280]  that things are in place and Patreon we'll see at first.
[28:57.880 --> 29:01.880]  I can't, uh, I can't wait for us to be podcasting from the same space again.
[29:02.520 --> 29:08.320]  Like there is something lost when it's I'm staring at a screen with lights in my face.
[29:08.600 --> 29:11.520]  There's just that millisecond of social, like, is he done talking?
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.160]  Do I talk now?
[29:12.160 --> 29:13.000]  Do I talk over him?
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.520]  Like there's that one millisecond that we both hesitate.
[29:15.560 --> 29:20.920]  So yeah, I'm, it's a lot harder to do this over, over zoom than it is in person.
[29:21.240 --> 29:24.760]  And, uh, just hanging out with you for a brief moment the other day, as you were
[29:24.760 --> 29:28.760]  headed, uh, from the dispensary, just seeing you for that moment, uh, to human
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.040]  interaction was fucking golden.
[29:30.080 --> 29:30.600]  That was cool.
[29:30.880 --> 29:31.840]  Yeah.
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.320]  Like you forget what human interaction is like during COVID fuck.
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.600]  It's it's just the store clerk and the people in your house.
[29:41.920 --> 29:42.760]  I thought I was confused.
[29:42.760 --> 29:45.000]  I was like, someone's at the doorbell and I didn't order grub hub.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.080]  What the fuck is going on?
[29:47.480 --> 29:48.760]  Did not bring you a sandwich.
[29:48.760 --> 29:49.560]  No, it was better.
[29:49.560 --> 29:50.000]  It was better.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.880]  There was a human with concentrates.
[29:52.520 --> 29:52.800]  Right.
[29:52.800 --> 29:56.280]  I bought conversation in hash way better.
[29:56.640 --> 29:57.880]  I'm down to hang out with white Mike.
[29:57.880 --> 29:59.040]  I haven't seen you in a minute, bro.
[29:59.800 --> 30:01.320]  I felt like a dog is like, how you been bro?
[30:01.360 --> 30:01.840]  What's going on?
[30:03.240 --> 30:03.800]  How's everything going?
[30:03.920 --> 30:04.440]  How's the wife?
[30:04.560 --> 30:05.560]  Is that a new house coming along?
[30:05.560 --> 30:06.520]  Well, you want a podcast?
[30:06.520 --> 30:07.200]  What do you want to talk about?
[30:07.400 --> 30:08.680]  This is fucking excited, dude.
[30:09.280 --> 30:09.600]  Yeah.
[30:09.600 --> 30:15.200]  It, uh, uh, I'm happy to skip the odd social engagement because I'd
[30:15.200 --> 30:17.080]  rather stay home and avoid people.
[30:17.080 --> 30:18.920]  But man, it's, we've had enough of that.
[30:18.920 --> 30:23.360]  I just invite me to a fucking mixer and we'll chit chat for hours.
[30:23.920 --> 30:24.280]  Yeah.
[30:24.360 --> 30:25.160]  I'm, I'm torn.
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.000]  People want me to go to events and people are throwing events and I'm like, give
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.840]  me just a little bit more time, see how all this stuff plays out and then in a
[30:31.840 --> 30:33.080]  little bit, we'll go to events.
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.640]  Like I'm fighting the urge to just try to chit chat with people texting
[30:37.640 --> 30:38.880]  me random political stuff.
[30:38.880 --> 30:40.000]  Like vote no on this.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  It's like, okay, but like, how was your day?
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.440]  Oh, I told you send me a message like, Hey, have you voted on this?
[30:46.640 --> 30:48.280]  I tell them my views.
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.640]  And then I asked them weird questions.
[30:50.520 --> 30:54.280]  I was sending them, um, quotes from some of my favorite comedians and other
[30:54.280 --> 30:57.840]  podcasts, but I decided that maybe some of the things that we're saying might
[30:57.840 --> 30:59.600]  be lewd and could get me in trouble.
[30:59.600 --> 31:01.080]  And I might not want to do that anymore.
[31:01.560 --> 31:07.840]  Uh, sent a, uh, quote from one of my favorite podcasts to one of the political,
[31:07.880 --> 31:09.400]  uh, whatever they're called.
[31:09.400 --> 31:12.960]  And they reply with another quote from the same podcast.
[31:12.960 --> 31:13.720]  Nice.
[31:13.880 --> 31:14.800]  I told me to count on me.
[31:14.800 --> 31:16.640]  I'm going to vote for you just because you knew what that was.
[31:17.320 --> 31:18.000]  Nice.
[31:18.040 --> 31:22.880]  The one, uh, the one I had fun trolling was the, the, uh, we want to warranty your
[31:22.880 --> 31:23.320]  car.
[31:26.120 --> 31:27.480]  I had fun with those people.
[31:27.480 --> 31:29.600]  I was like, you really don't want to warrant to my car.
[31:29.640 --> 31:32.200]  I'll tell you about it and watch you hang up on me.
[31:32.760 --> 31:33.840]  That got me off their list.
[31:33.840 --> 31:34.400]  Quick.
[31:34.760 --> 31:41.960]  I worked at a telemarketing firm for a summer and they gave me Jedi training.
[31:42.240 --> 31:44.560]  Like that's behind a microphone.
[31:44.560 --> 31:45.120]  That's part of it.
[31:45.120 --> 31:47.120]  Also a stage presence and just so much time doing it.
[31:47.120 --> 31:48.360]  I was a musician for a long time.
[31:48.680 --> 31:51.320]  Uh, not the front man, but I was on the stage singing or playing the drums.
[31:51.320 --> 31:52.000]  I was never singing.
[31:52.200 --> 31:52.920]  It's playing the drums.
[31:53.280 --> 31:54.320]  I was just on stage.
[31:54.320 --> 31:57.120]  People are looking at you and that fucking, and then I worked, I've worked
[31:57.120 --> 32:01.640]  in the retail, uh, but, uh, yeah, I've totally lost my train of thought.
[32:01.640 --> 32:02.520]  So jump in with something.
[32:04.200 --> 32:04.480]  Yeah.
[32:04.480 --> 32:07.280]  You get a, you get comfortable in front of a camera in front of
[32:07.280 --> 32:08.880]  talking, doing retail Jesus.
[32:09.960 --> 32:10.320]  Yeah.
[32:11.120 --> 32:11.320]  Yeah.
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.480]  I just want to come in and buy some shit and you got to deal with them.
[32:13.560 --> 32:14.360]  What the fuck was I saying?
[32:14.360 --> 32:15.480]  Mike put me back on track.
[32:15.920 --> 32:16.720]  I don't even remember.
[32:16.720 --> 32:18.520]  This is a high ass Ramblecast man.
[32:18.520 --> 32:20.160]  That was the last two rips on my pen.
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.280]  Got me space coasting.
[32:21.760 --> 32:23.040]  Social places.
[32:23.080 --> 32:23.520]  Yep.
[32:24.240 --> 32:26.640]  Uh, my social places, dads, hoodies.
[32:26.960 --> 32:28.000]  Yeah, we lost it.
[32:28.080 --> 32:29.520]  And fucking shit, chat COVID.
[32:30.240 --> 32:30.640]  COVID.
[32:30.640 --> 32:31.720]  I sound like Mark Norman.
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.640]  Can you, uh, are you having trouble telling the length of time that has
[32:35.640 --> 32:39.200]  passed, like, when you think back of stuff that happened, can you tell if
[32:39.200 --> 32:41.400]  it was in March or if it was in August?
[32:41.720 --> 32:43.840]  Um, I checked in with you.
[32:43.840 --> 32:45.080]  I was like, bro, am I going crazy?
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.000]  Because this sweater thing that I bought this fucking, it's all wool.
[32:49.160 --> 32:51.040]  It's fucking for a complete warm season.
[32:51.120 --> 32:52.120]  I'm nice and warm.
[32:52.120 --> 32:53.160]  It's, I don't have the heater on.
[32:53.440 --> 32:54.840]  Uh, I'm warm because of this fucking thing.
[32:54.840 --> 32:55.800]  I bought this in like March.
[32:55.800 --> 32:59.160]  Cause I couldn't tell what season or month it was anymore.
[32:59.160 --> 33:00.520]  We got ripped off for a summer.
[33:00.800 --> 33:01.880]  I was like, well, we don't get to go out.
[33:01.880 --> 33:02.640]  It's not summer.
[33:02.760 --> 33:05.840]  I feel like in the summer I go to a concert and a comedy show every fucking
[33:05.840 --> 33:08.720]  weekend, that's how I roll comedy show, concert, comedy, concert.
[33:09.040 --> 33:09.720]  Didn't do that.
[33:09.800 --> 33:14.080]  Thought it was fall because of that found myself buying pants and sweaters and
[33:14.080 --> 33:16.320]  things online when I was doing online shopping.
[33:16.560 --> 33:19.600]  So now that the winter's here, I've got a whole new fucking fall winter out.
[33:20.880 --> 33:21.040]  Yeah.
[33:21.040 --> 33:23.400]  Because I was just like, you're saying I didn't know what the fuck
[33:23.400 --> 33:24.960]  season or time of year it was.
[33:25.400 --> 33:30.320]  And now that it's, uh, dark so early, I really have no concept of fucking time.
[33:30.640 --> 33:33.080]  Like I woke up at six 30 in the morning and looked at my phone.
[33:33.320 --> 33:35.960]  I looked at the clock and it said six 30 and I looked at the sky and I was like,
[33:36.040 --> 33:39.880]  am or PM dude, like I'm not even like, yeah.
[33:40.480 --> 33:40.680]  Yeah.
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.720]  It's, I had somebody asking me, um, it was basic stuff about like how long my
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.000]  kids been back in school and I was completely unable to give them an
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.680]  accurate, like it's been six weeks, it's been two months, it's been nine months.
[33:55.720 --> 33:58.520]  Like just no concept of time anymore.
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.160]  I would base my time off of events that happened.
[34:02.160 --> 34:05.640]  Like, well, it had to be in March because we saw Bobby Lee.
[34:05.840 --> 34:09.560]  It had to be in right on the way home from the Brennan Schaub comedy show,
[34:09.560 --> 34:10.720]  or it was between these two.
[34:11.120 --> 34:15.520]  Like, but none of that, man, none of that.
[34:15.520 --> 34:20.440]  And, uh, we're gearing up for the holidays and talking about like, well,
[34:21.120 --> 34:23.680]  we only want to have one or two people at a time.
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.360]  So we're going to do this and that person gets to come for this one, but not that one,
[34:27.360 --> 34:27.640]  man.
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.080]  Did the, it's going to be interesting window.
[34:30.080 --> 34:30.880]  That's for damn sure.
[34:31.280 --> 34:31.600]  Yeah.
[34:31.760 --> 34:33.440]  Uh, lots of podcasting.
[34:33.520 --> 34:34.000]  Stay tuned.
[34:34.000 --> 34:34.720]  Be prepared for some.
[34:35.960 --> 34:36.320]  Yep.
[34:36.360 --> 34:37.840]  More content coming at you.
[34:37.960 --> 34:39.240]  The one I'll be rebel cast.
[34:39.240 --> 34:41.600]  We did have a couple of good emails selected for this show.
[34:41.600 --> 34:42.600]  We'll do those next show.
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.680]  Those are definitely going to come up in another episode.
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.760]  They may have already happened in the episode before this, just because of the
[34:47.760 --> 34:49.840]  magic of the way that podcasting and editing.
[34:50.400 --> 34:52.240]  Different good emails for the next one.
[34:52.720 --> 34:53.760]  If that's how she go.
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.760]  We picked a couple, but I think we had so much fun just hanging out that we, uh, may
[34:57.760 --> 34:59.440]  have forgotten that there was a job to do.
[34:59.440 --> 35:00.800]  Mike, we had too much fun in the break.
[35:00.800 --> 35:01.440]  That's all right.
[35:02.320 --> 35:03.400]  Though we did the job.
[35:03.400 --> 35:05.360]  We, we, we chatted.
[35:07.560 --> 35:09.000]  We came, they saw, we went.
[35:10.040 --> 35:12.480]  Yeah, it's a, it's a COVID cast.
[35:12.480 --> 35:12.800]  Yeah.
[35:12.840 --> 35:14.080]  We're, uh, we're here.
[35:14.920 --> 35:15.560]  We're baked.
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.160]  Uh, ask us questions.
[35:18.400 --> 35:19.400]  Speaking of baked, bro.
[35:19.400 --> 35:22.080]  Let's wrap up this podcast and take some freaking dabs.
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.200]  How does that sound?
[35:23.760 --> 35:24.680]  I like that idea.
[35:25.160 --> 35:25.440]  All right.
[35:25.440 --> 35:25.920]  Podcast.
[35:25.920 --> 35:26.880]  I like that idea.
[35:26.960 --> 35:29.640]  Um, yeah, reach out to us, ask us questions.
[35:30.560 --> 35:32.040]  How can they get ahold of you, Jeff?
[35:32.200 --> 35:34.320]  If I wanted to send you an email, how would I go?
[35:34.320 --> 35:34.960]  It's about it.
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.480]  Uh, the best way to do it would be to send me an email at, uh, grow from your
[35:39.480 --> 35:42.160]  heart at hotmail.com that'll get to me.
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.920]  Mike, do you have a preferred method so that, uh, if this message garnishes,
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.160]  garners, garnishes, renders any fucking emails?
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.480]  Um, you can hit me up at, uh, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or Pueblo for
[35:55.480 --> 35:57.560]  sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.440]  Um, you could also just send an email to the grow from your heart podcast email
[36:02.440 --> 36:04.520]  and put forward to white Mike at the top.
[36:05.000 --> 36:05.360]  There you go.
[36:05.360 --> 36:07.200]  Jeff, do some clerical work.
[36:07.640 --> 36:09.240]  I was going to say, don't give them just the Twitter.
[36:09.240 --> 36:11.800]  Cause they may want to cuss you out in more than 140.
[36:12.280 --> 36:13.800]  That's what the DMS are for.
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.800]  So you can send your hand mail to my DMS and I won't look at it there either.
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.080]  Our Patrion's patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.400]  Patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[36:25.600 --> 36:26.240]  Help us both.
[36:26.760 --> 36:29.040]  Again, if you can only do one this month, do white Mike.
[36:29.240 --> 36:31.800]  Uh, when the fresh year starts, come back, hang out with Rasta, Jeff.

[36:57.920 --> 36:58.920]  I just want you to go look at it.
[37:00.520 --> 37:01.120]  Dot com.
[37:01.120 --> 37:02.320]  There's a link to buy seeds.
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.960]  A lot of people say, how do we get your seeds?
[37:04.240 --> 37:04.920]  Links are on there.
[37:04.920 --> 37:06.000]  All the vendors are there.

[37:09.560 --> 37:10.600]  There are more shirts coming.
[37:10.600 --> 37:11.920]  I got three designs up now.
[37:12.120 --> 37:13.400]  More shirts in the works.
[37:13.400 --> 37:14.080]  Does that rhyme?
[37:14.160 --> 37:14.880]  It's happening.
[37:15.160 --> 37:15.680]  I'm rapping.

[37:19.520 --> 37:20.000]  Thank you, bro.
[37:20.040 --> 37:22.120]  Uh, you got to come by and pick up your shirts.
[37:22.120 --> 37:23.400]  Cause yep.
[37:23.640 --> 37:24.760]  I placed an order.
[37:24.760 --> 37:26.160]  You should too.
[37:26.680 --> 37:27.040]  Yeah.
[37:27.080 --> 37:29.120]  All the cool kids are doing it, man.
[37:29.760 --> 37:30.440]  They are.
[37:30.600 --> 37:31.520]  I think that's all we've got, Mike.
[37:31.520 --> 37:34.040]  Let's wrap this up before we get too rambly again, because we can dig
[37:34.040 --> 37:35.840]  ourselves into a big old hole and never shut up.
[37:35.840 --> 37:36.640]  We are good at that.
[37:36.800 --> 37:37.880]  Thank you for hanging out, bro.
[37:38.480 --> 37:40.800]  If you're a listener, that's like, no dig.
[37:40.920 --> 37:41.840]  I want to hear from you.
[37:41.840 --> 37:42.400]  Reach out.
[37:43.680 --> 37:43.880]  Yeah.
[37:43.880 --> 37:45.120]  We'll, we'll just do more episodes.
[37:45.120 --> 37:46.200]  They're going to get more content.
[37:46.200 --> 37:48.800]  Maybe not today, but in the very near future, they will.
[37:48.800 --> 37:50.040]  Very near future folks.
[37:50.040 --> 37:50.840]  We're not going anywhere.
[37:51.720 --> 37:53.800]  Um, yeah, it's too cold to go anywhere, bro.
[37:53.800 --> 37:56.760]  We're too fucking cold and it's COVID-y.
[37:57.920 --> 37:58.080]  All right.
[37:58.080 --> 38:00.240]  I got to wrap this up before this song ends.
[38:00.360 --> 38:01.960]  So, uh, dude, thank you for hanging out.
[38:01.960 --> 38:03.440]  Let's hang out and take some dabs after this.
[38:03.680 --> 38:04.440]  Everybody else.
[38:04.440 --> 38:06.880]  I'll see you in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.280]  Let's give a giant shout out to my friend, the Canna Crat.
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.200]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
