[00:10.380 --> 00:11.380]  Heart podcast.
[00:11.380 --> 00:15.400]  In this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about setting up an auto watering system
[00:15.400 --> 00:16.800]  for our plants.
[00:16.800 --> 00:20.780]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[00:20.780 --> 00:25.800]  Of course, the 710 club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:25.800 --> 00:27.180]  level or higher.
[00:27.180 --> 00:30.720]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.720 --> 00:31.720]  Thank you.
[00:31.720 --> 00:34.300]  Shout out to my friend, Canna Reaper 413.

[01:02.040 --> 01:03.040]  Thank you.

[01:39.440 --> 01:44.160]  I want to start this episode by giving some congratulations to a few of my friends.
[01:44.160 --> 01:47.080]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:47.080 --> 01:50.540]  Congratulations to the entire state of New York.
[01:50.540 --> 01:51.540]  Congratulations to New York.
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.820]  You have some great friends out there.
[01:52.820 --> 01:55.140]  I'm excited for you.
[01:55.140 --> 01:58.100]  Also let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:58.100 --> 02:00.880]  Congratulations to everyone in the state of New Mexico.
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.160]  New York and New Mexico have both legalized adult use cannabis.
[02:05.160 --> 02:06.160]  That's right.
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.100]  If you're 21 and older, you will be allowed to smoke cannabis in those states without
[02:10.100 --> 02:13.560]  any fear of trouble, persecution, repercussion.
[02:13.560 --> 02:14.560]  Enjoy your cannabis.
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.260]  I'm not sure the rules, the regulations, the laws, I'm not sure when and where and how you
[02:18.260 --> 02:19.680]  can consume.
[02:20.060 --> 02:24.700]  We have got legal recreational cannabis now in the state of New Mexico and in the state
[02:24.700 --> 02:25.700]  of New York.
[02:25.700 --> 02:27.160]  Big shout out to all of my friends there.
[02:27.160 --> 02:29.780]  You guys know I've got a lot of good friends in New Mexico.
[02:29.780 --> 02:34.340]  They have had legal medical cannabis in New Mexico for quite a while now.
[02:34.340 --> 02:38.980]  They've got a nice legal medical industry going on down there and they have just passed
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.840]  recreational cannabis.
[02:40.840 --> 02:42.920]  Big shout out to all of my friends in the industry down there.
[02:42.920 --> 02:46.440]  If you need more help, more questions, more guidance, I look forward to driving down and
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.440]  helping you guys out.
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.980]  Get all those new recreational facilities up and running.
[02:50.980 --> 02:55.760]  I can't wait to get back down there, get a sunburn, get you guys growing like pros.
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.000]  Also big shout out to New York.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.460]  They have got legal cannabis now.
[02:58.460 --> 03:01.440]  That is going to make life a lot easier for a lot of people.
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.280]  New York had a lot of petty crime that resulted in cannabis arrests or stupid cannabis arrests.
[03:07.280 --> 03:08.840]  People were in trouble for dumb shit.
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.640]  This will make New York a lot more peaceful, a lot more relaxed, less tense of a place.
[03:13.640 --> 03:16.360]  People can smoke and not have to worry about it.
[03:16.400 --> 03:19.800]  People won't go to jail because they've got a little bit of cannabis on them just trying
[03:19.800 --> 03:21.040]  to enjoy their lives.
[03:21.040 --> 03:22.040]  So big shout out.
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.000]  I'm rambling about it because I'm excited.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.400]  Big shout out to our new friends in the legal cannabis club.
[03:28.400 --> 03:29.400]  Welcome to the club.
[03:29.400 --> 03:30.400]  Gang gang.
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.400]  Dab dab.
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.400]  Be careful.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.400]  Follow the rules.
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.480]  Don't get yourself in trouble.
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.400]  Even though it's legal, even though it's decriminalized, recreational allowed, whatever, there are
[03:38.400 --> 03:41.060]  still going to be a bunch of rules, a bunch of loopholes.
[03:41.060 --> 03:43.100]  There will be ways for you to fuck up and get in trouble.
[03:43.100 --> 03:45.400]  So be very careful with that.
[03:45.440 --> 03:46.840]  Don't get carried away too quickly.
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.840]  All right.
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.120]  So that wraps up the congratulations portion of the podcast.
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.600]  Big congrats to New York and New Mexico for legalized adult use.
[03:54.600 --> 03:57.200]  Can't wait to get back down to New Mexico and hang out with some of my friends.
[03:57.200 --> 04:01.200]  Take some dabs, go see some scenery down in the South.
[04:01.200 --> 04:02.200]  Always have a good time down there.
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.080]  Shout out to the New Mexico gang.
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.080]  Where are we going from there?
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.000]  We are going to talk about the main topic of this podcast.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.600]  I got two messages.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.960]  Both of them were on Patreon.
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.640]  Both of them were within a couple of days of each other and they were both about the
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.640]  same thing.
[04:15.640 --> 04:17.400]  So I'm going to read both of the messages.
[04:17.400 --> 04:20.920]  I'm sure the point will be obvious by then and then we will talk a little bit about how
[04:20.920 --> 04:23.440]  to do the tricks they are asking for.
[04:23.440 --> 04:24.440]  All right.
[04:24.440 --> 04:27.080]  So the first message in today's episode goes a lot like this.
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.540]  It came from Girls Grow Too and it goes just like this.
[04:31.540 --> 04:34.800]  It says, Hey Ross to Jeff, I've got a question for you.
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.600]  After the COVID lockdown, I'm ready to go on a real vacation, like far, far away from
[04:39.600 --> 04:40.600]  the house for a while.
[04:40.600 --> 04:42.920]  Yes, I know what you mean.
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.360]  It says the trouble is I can't be gone for more than three or four days max because of
[04:47.360 --> 04:48.360]  the grow.
[04:48.360 --> 04:49.960]  Oh, trust me.
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.600]  I probably more than anybody know exactly what you mean.
[04:53.600 --> 04:54.720]  I sympathize with you.
[04:54.720 --> 04:55.720]  I empathize with you.
[04:55.720 --> 04:56.720]  I feel for you.
[04:56.720 --> 04:59.160]  I'm in the same club in the same gang as you.
[04:59.160 --> 05:02.880]  I would like to go on a vacation, but I can't be gone for more than four days because I
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.880]  do know that by the end of that fourth day, I no longer have plants, which means I no
[05:07.880 --> 05:11.880]  longer have a business, which means I no longer, Oh, let's not go that route.
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.020]  Let's not think about that.
[05:13.020 --> 05:14.360]  But you are absolutely correct.
[05:14.360 --> 05:17.960]  Within three or four days of leaving, I have to come back and water the plants.
[05:17.960 --> 05:19.380]  That means I get a fish weekend.
[05:19.380 --> 05:22.200]  I can leave Friday, got to be back Sunday night.
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.720]  Maybe I can push it Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, if I'm lucky, but you are absolutely
[05:26.720 --> 05:27.720]  correct.
[05:27.720 --> 05:29.960]  It's hard to get away because of the grove does keep us locked down.
[05:29.960 --> 05:31.580]  It does need to be watered.
[05:31.580 --> 05:34.560]  So it says, sure, I could plan a trip and stop the grow and all that, but it would be
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.560]  a pain in the, in the ass and a huge production loss.
[05:37.560 --> 05:38.560]  Yes, absolutely.
[05:39.040 --> 05:43.240]  Shutting down for any amount of time can be a huge pain in the ass and a huge production
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.240]  loss.
[05:44.240 --> 05:46.720]  Uh, first of all, what would I do with my mother plants?
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.800]  If I were to shut down, I need those genetics.
[05:48.800 --> 05:49.800]  You need your genetics.
[05:49.800 --> 05:50.800]  We've done Fino hunts.
[05:50.800 --> 05:52.540]  We've selected plants.
[05:52.540 --> 05:56.880]  They work well in our grow well for our body, well for our customers, uh, well for our medical
[05:56.880 --> 05:57.880]  needs.
[05:57.880 --> 05:58.920]  Now we're going to get rid of that.
[05:58.920 --> 05:59.920]  That's bullshit.
[05:59.920 --> 06:00.920]  We can't do that.
[06:00.920 --> 06:01.920]  And then production loss.
[06:01.920 --> 06:02.920]  Yeah.
[06:02.920 --> 06:04.120]  I'm going to need medicine when I get back from my vacation.
[06:04.120 --> 06:06.960]  So plus I need extra medicine to take on vacation.
[06:06.960 --> 06:07.960]  So you're right.
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.960]  It's a huge pain in the ass.
[06:08.960 --> 06:13.320]  So it says, what are your thoughts on some sort of auto watering system?
[06:13.320 --> 06:14.320]  Yes.
[06:14.320 --> 06:16.280]  An auto watering system would be a great idea.
[06:16.280 --> 06:21.000]  I do work in commercial cultivation facilities and when I take over the commercial grows,
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  the first thing I do is get rid of the bug and mildew problems.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.040]  The next thing that I do is I go in and I build an auto watering system so that we aren't
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.600]  paying people to hand water plants all day.
[06:30.600 --> 06:35.520]  It can suck up the entire day and a commercial grow watering hundreds of plants, or we can
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.160]  spend two or three days building an auto watering system and then for the rest of that
[06:39.160 --> 06:42.320]  facility you press a button and all of the plants get watered.
[06:42.320 --> 06:45.440]  So yes, an auto watering system is amazing.
[06:45.440 --> 06:50.280]  It says I have severe trust issues, so I trust literally no one to do any of the work in
[06:50.280 --> 06:51.440]  my grow except for me.
[06:51.440 --> 06:52.680]  I understand that.
[06:52.680 --> 06:53.680]  Trust me.
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.800]  Uh, I have my own personal grow where nobody touches anything but me and then I'm in charge
[06:57.800 --> 07:02.760]  of commercial grows quite often where I have to trust people to control that grow while
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.760]  I'm gone.
[07:03.760 --> 07:07.480]  So if I'm going to go away for a week for a weekend and I've got to just trust the crew
[07:07.480 --> 07:10.480]  there, that is a little bit nerve wracking, a little bit sketchy.
[07:10.480 --> 07:12.160]  I know how you feel.
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.920]  It wraps up with a thank you.
[07:13.920 --> 07:14.920]  Rasta Jeff.
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.680]  I loved seeing white Mike on the recent episode.
[07:16.680 --> 07:18.640]  You guys are always a great time.
[07:18.640 --> 07:19.680]  Hey girls grow too.
[07:19.680 --> 07:20.800]  Thank you for the great message.
[07:20.800 --> 07:24.200]  I'm going to talk a little bit about building an auto watering system.
[07:24.200 --> 07:27.400]  I'll make sure that Mike gets a high five and a fist bump for you.
[07:27.400 --> 07:29.320]  Before we get to that, let's read one more message.
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.480]  This one comes from coach Steve and it says, I don't have a question, but I would like
[07:33.480 --> 07:38.560]  to hear your details on an auto watering system components timing.
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.840]  I'm a handy dude, so I've got a general idea, but your insight could help me get this right
[07:42.840 --> 07:43.840]  the first time.
[07:43.840 --> 07:46.680]  I like that you're trying to get it right the first time because when you're building
[07:46.680 --> 07:52.000]  an auto watering system, you absolutely could make a huge auto watered mess.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.320]  You could just auto water the floor.
[07:53.320 --> 07:55.080]  You could auto water the ceiling.
[07:55.080 --> 07:56.080]  Depends on how things go.
[07:56.080 --> 07:57.120]  You could totally fuck this up.
[07:57.120 --> 08:00.280]  So I'm glad you're trying to pay attention and get it right the first time.
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.920]  This one pops up with, I just finished my last run of organics and soil and I'm ready
[08:03.920 --> 08:05.960]  for a Ferrari.
[08:05.960 --> 08:09.480]  Cocoa and synthetics has me all excited.
[08:09.480 --> 08:13.080]  So much love and respect to you from coach Steve.
[08:13.080 --> 08:15.840]  All right, coach Steve and girls grow too.
[08:15.840 --> 08:19.640]  This is a great question, a great thing to get me ranting on here on the podcast.
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.120]  So I'm going to take a quick sip of some water and then we're going to talk about building
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.560]  an auto watering system for our plants so that we can sneak away for a couple of days
[08:27.720 --> 08:32.560]  or maybe use the auto watering system to more consistently water the plants.
[08:32.560 --> 08:36.920]  Also water those plants every day so that we can dedicate more time and energy and focus
[08:36.920 --> 08:42.600]  on other things like defoliation, popping, twisting, sweeping, vacuuming, cleaning, all
[08:42.600 --> 08:46.320]  the random shit that has to happen in the house and in the grow that kind of gets overlooked
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.240]  because we're more focused on the super important parts of the grow.
[08:49.240 --> 08:53.040]  I'm going to take a sip and then we're going to talk about building this auto watering
[08:53.040 --> 08:54.040]  system.
[08:54.040 --> 09:04.960]  All right, all right, all right.
[09:04.960 --> 09:06.600]  Thanks for being patient with me while I hydrate.
[09:06.600 --> 09:09.560]  I either edited that out or you watched me take a drink.
[09:09.560 --> 09:10.560]  Big thanks.
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.120]  Now let's talk about building an auto watering system.
[09:14.120 --> 09:19.560]  Building a system for auto watering will vary based on how many plants you have, how much
[09:19.560 --> 09:23.000]  water you're trying to use and how big your grow space is.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.080]  That's going to be the main deciding factor on building an auto watering system for a
[09:27.080 --> 09:29.520]  small grow, for a small personal grow.
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.640]  They do sell pre fabricated auto watering systems.
[09:33.640 --> 09:34.860]  It comes with a pump.
[09:34.860 --> 09:40.140]  It comes with all of the tubing you will need to get that water to your grow area.
[09:40.140 --> 09:43.860]  Then it comes with little extenders to get the water to the plants.
[09:43.860 --> 09:47.700]  If you have a small grow, that will work.
[09:47.700 --> 09:53.780]  However, I always recommend even with the homemade or the purchased kit for an auto
[09:53.780 --> 09:58.980]  watering system, I will always recommend having a backup pump on hand.
[09:58.980 --> 10:01.480]  Those pumps are designed to move water.
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.160]  Most of them aren't designed to move water with nutrients in them.
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.400]  Those pumps are going to burn out.
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.400]  They're going to get hot.
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.800]  They're going to get used a lot and they're going to cook one day when you least expect
[10:12.800 --> 10:13.800]  it.
[10:13.800 --> 10:16.680]  It's probably going to be at the worst time.
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.880]  No matter what auto watering system you choose to build, buy, purchase, work with, complete,
[10:21.880 --> 10:24.080]  I highly recommend a backup pump.
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.360]  Whatever pump you get, get another one just like it.
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.280]  If the package comes with a pump, buy another one that's just like it or better so that
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.080]  you've got a backup.
[10:33.080 --> 10:36.160]  If you're going to build one with a Mondi pump that I talk about, get two of the Mondi
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.160]  pumps.
[10:37.160 --> 10:39.040]  Let's talk about building a watering system.
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.720]  The main thing you're going to need, the main things you're going to need are a reservoir.
[10:43.720 --> 10:49.480]  How much water will your plants need for the duration of time you intend to be gone from
[10:49.480 --> 10:50.720]  your garden?
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.680]  How often do you water the plants?
[10:52.680 --> 10:55.480]  I water about every three days.
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.000]  I water about five gallons of water per light every three days.
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.240]  Now I know that if I'm going to be gone for a week, that'll be two waterings, I'm going
[11:05.240 --> 11:07.800]  to need approximately 10 gallons of water.
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.120]  I'll need a reservoir that will hold a minimum of 10 gallons.
[11:12.120 --> 11:13.640]  I'd like to be gone for a little longer.
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.800]  I'd like to buy myself a day or two on each end of that just so I can, maybe my flight
[11:18.800 --> 11:21.920]  gets delayed, maybe something terrible happens and I'm gone longer.
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.920]  I'm going to try to go for a 12 to 14 day reservoir, which means I'm going to need probably
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.660]  three, maybe four waterings in there, probably 20 gallons.
[11:30.660 --> 11:33.780]  This is where you got to decide what size reservoir you want to get.
[11:33.780 --> 11:37.540]  I like a rubber made trash can or a brute trash can.
[11:37.540 --> 11:38.660]  I get the 30 gallon.
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.500]  I think it's a 32 or a 30.
[11:40.500 --> 11:45.740]  I get the big trash can and they sell wheels for it at the hardware store.
[11:45.740 --> 11:50.260]  Right next to the trash cans will be wheels that snap onto the bottom of your trash can.
[11:50.260 --> 11:51.300]  The trash can sits on it.
[11:51.300 --> 11:52.420]  You turn the can.
[11:52.420 --> 11:54.860]  Now the wheels are secured onto the trash can.
[11:54.860 --> 11:57.940]  I would take some duct tape and tape that bitch on there just so you never have any
[11:57.940 --> 12:00.060]  accidents, but tape the wheels to there.
[12:00.060 --> 12:01.900]  Now you've got a reservoir on wheels.
[12:01.900 --> 12:04.100]  You can roll that to your water supply.
[12:04.100 --> 12:06.220]  I don't know where your water supply is.
[12:06.220 --> 12:07.220]  Maybe it's far away.
[12:07.220 --> 12:10.660]  Maybe it's right next to your grill, but now you've got a reservoir on wheels that you
[12:10.660 --> 12:14.540]  can roll to the water supply, roll it right back to where you need it.
[12:14.540 --> 12:18.820]  Another thing I'm going to recommend, I'm going to back up a step at the local hardware
[12:18.820 --> 12:19.820]  store.
[12:19.820 --> 12:22.580]  If you're growing in your home, you've probably got a shower or a sink.
[12:22.580 --> 12:24.820]  How do you get water to that big reservoir?
[12:24.820 --> 12:25.820]  You don't have a spout.
[12:25.820 --> 12:26.860]  You don't have a hose.
[12:26.860 --> 12:31.580]  I've discovered that is very friendly, very easy to install, very useful for many different
[12:31.580 --> 12:32.580]  reasons.
[12:32.580 --> 12:34.060]  I use it for a lot of different things.
[12:34.060 --> 12:38.980]  They sell a device that is used to wash your dog at the hardware store.
[12:38.980 --> 12:40.740]  So your shower comes out of the wall.
[12:40.740 --> 12:44.660]  It's got the normal shower spout and then the head screws onto that spout.
[12:44.660 --> 12:49.740]  To install this new hose, you unscrew the shower head, put in a coupler and screw the
[12:49.740 --> 12:51.280]  shower head back on.
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.220]  Now your shower is just like it was, except it's about three, maybe four or five inches
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.220]  longer.
[12:56.260 --> 12:58.260]  If you're a tall guy like me, now it's closer to your head.
[12:58.260 --> 12:59.700]  That kind of sucks, but you'll deal with that.
[12:59.700 --> 13:01.180]  It'll be worth it.
[13:01.180 --> 13:05.500]  So you add this device that adds a coupler and an extender.
[13:05.500 --> 13:10.060]  In that extender is a little piece that you screw in another hose and that hose has a
[13:10.060 --> 13:13.820]  long hose with like a shower head on it with an on and off spout.
[13:13.820 --> 13:17.580]  So now you've got a shower head that you can move around in your bathroom wherever you
[13:17.580 --> 13:18.580]  need to get it to.
[13:18.580 --> 13:20.900]  You can use that hose to fill up your buckets.
[13:20.900 --> 13:23.220]  You can use that hose to fill up your reservoir.
[13:23.220 --> 13:27.260]  You can use that hose to clean off things that you can't move around as well.
[13:27.260 --> 13:31.140]  You can get that hose to the things instead of getting the things to the shower if that
[13:31.140 --> 13:32.260]  helps you.
[13:32.260 --> 13:34.780]  Maybe you're a smart ass and you've already got one of the showers with the heads that
[13:34.780 --> 13:36.460]  comes off and you're using that.
[13:36.460 --> 13:39.640]  I don't want to shower with the same head I stuck in the five gallon bucket.
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.580]  So I bought the dog cleaning shower kit and it works beautifully for filling reservoirs,
[13:44.580 --> 13:46.620]  filling buckets and cleaning shit.
[13:46.620 --> 13:48.980]  Make sure you use the plumbing tape when you do it.
[13:48.980 --> 13:52.660]  Take off the shower head, put a piece of plumbing tape on the threads, put that new attachment
[13:52.660 --> 13:56.180]  on, put some plumbing tape on the shower head, put the shower head back on.
[13:56.180 --> 13:57.180]  You're almost ready to go.
[13:57.180 --> 14:00.980]  Now you've got a middle piece that receives that extra hose piece.
[14:00.980 --> 14:02.300]  You can just pop it off, put it back on.
[14:02.300 --> 14:04.060]  It will honestly just leave it there.
[14:04.060 --> 14:05.300]  It's dangling down all the time.
[14:05.300 --> 14:08.020]  I can fill a bucket, fill a reservoir just about any time.
[14:08.020 --> 14:10.420]  It's got its own off and on switch too, which I really like.
[14:10.420 --> 14:12.820]  That's a long ramble for that piece of equipment.
[14:12.820 --> 14:15.780]  Get that little bitch, then get your trash can, get your trash can on wheels, fill the
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.020]  trash can up.
[14:17.020 --> 14:21.620]  Now here's where we're going to start building an auto watering system.
[14:21.620 --> 14:22.900]  This is how I do it.
[14:22.900 --> 14:28.380]  This is going to be kind of vague, kind of generic, but I'm not there.
[14:28.380 --> 14:29.900]  I don't know what your grow space looks like.
[14:29.900 --> 14:30.900]  I don't know your budget.
[14:30.900 --> 14:33.020]  I don't know your skill level.
[14:33.020 --> 14:36.860]  This is just going to be a vague idea for everybody so that we can get a good start
[14:36.860 --> 14:39.820]  at building an auto watering system.
[14:39.820 --> 14:41.340]  It's going to start with a reservoir.
[14:41.340 --> 14:44.260]  Like I've said before, how often do you want to water those plants?
[14:44.260 --> 14:48.100]  How many waterings do you want to get out of this water and reservoir?
[14:48.100 --> 14:49.660]  Get the appropriate size res.
[14:49.660 --> 14:51.580]  I like the trash can on wheels.
[14:51.580 --> 14:53.300]  So I've got the trash can on wheels.
[14:53.300 --> 14:54.300]  I fill it up.
[14:54.300 --> 14:55.660]  I put my nutrients in there.
[14:55.660 --> 15:00.100]  I adjust the pH and I adjust the, I make sure the EC is where I want it.
[15:00.100 --> 15:01.980]  I've got everything right in my water.
[15:01.980 --> 15:07.940]  Now, another really good idea is to have a stir pump in the bottom of your reservoir.
[15:07.940 --> 15:12.060]  Imagine that nutrients are, that nutrient and that water is sitting in solution for
[15:12.060 --> 15:14.580]  five, 10, 14 days.
[15:14.580 --> 15:16.580]  All the heavy shit is going right to the bottom.
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.740]  All the light stuff is going right to the top.
[15:18.740 --> 15:22.700]  So when your plants get fed next time, they're going to get fed all the heavy elements, whatever's
[15:22.700 --> 15:25.140]  heaviest, calcium and magnesium are the heavy ones.
[15:25.140 --> 15:26.460]  They're going to fall to the bottom.
[15:26.460 --> 15:28.580]  Your plants are going to get all of that on this feed.
[15:28.580 --> 15:31.860]  And then the next subsequent feedings, it's going to taper off until they just get plain
[15:31.860 --> 15:34.060]  water and the lighter elements.
[15:34.060 --> 15:38.840]  So put that stir pump in the bottom of your reservoir, plug it in, have it constantly
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.500]  stirring your nutrients, constantly stirring.
[15:41.500 --> 15:47.360]  If you can, if not have it come on when you trigger the timer to pump the water, which
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.840]  we'll talk about in the future, I would recommend having that water moving constantly.
[15:51.840 --> 15:53.720]  You don't want it getting stagnant and stale.
[15:53.720 --> 15:57.840]  It will get funky and you're going to feed your plants just the bottom, the thick part
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.840]  of the Kool-Aid.
[15:58.840 --> 16:01.200]  You got to stir the Kool-Aid so all the drinks taste good.
[16:01.200 --> 16:07.320]  So you've got your, now you've got your fill method with your dog washing hose attachment.
[16:07.320 --> 16:09.240]  You've got your reservoir on wheels.
[16:09.240 --> 16:13.080]  We've got a Mondi pump to start in there, which is going to be the base.
[16:13.080 --> 16:15.560]  And now we've got a stir pump in there, stirring up our nutrients.
[16:15.560 --> 16:18.400]  Now the next thing, we're going to work with the Mondi pump I'm talking about.
[16:18.400 --> 16:20.760]  I like to buy the Mondi pumps.
[16:20.760 --> 16:24.360]  I cannot remember exactly how many gallons per water or what the horsepower is on that
[16:24.360 --> 16:25.960]  fucking thing.
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.480]  Find the pump that is appropriate for you.
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.920]  Too much water movement is better than not enough because you've got to push this water
[16:31.920 --> 16:34.680]  through a bunch of tubing and it's got to get through some emitters.
[16:34.680 --> 16:37.480]  If you don't have enough pressure when it gets to the emitters, they just trickle and
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.480]  dribble.
[16:38.480 --> 16:40.620]  We want it to kind of emit and spray and make a nice pattern.
[16:40.620 --> 16:44.400]  So get a pump that is a little bit bigger than what you think you're going to use.
[16:44.400 --> 16:46.160]  I like the Mondi pump.
[16:46.160 --> 16:49.120]  It's usually just about less than a foot tall.
[16:49.120 --> 16:50.120]  Just weighs a few pounds.
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.280]  It's got a long cord on it.
[16:51.280 --> 16:57.040]  So you're going to get the Mondi pump and then you need tubing to go from the pump and
[16:57.040 --> 16:59.880]  the reservoir to your garden area.
[16:59.880 --> 17:01.760]  I don't know where your reservoir is going to be stored.
[17:01.760 --> 17:03.200]  I don't know where your pump will be stored.
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.440]  You'll probably need to be near electricity because you're going to have to plug in a
[17:06.440 --> 17:09.200]  timer and a couple of plugs for this.
[17:09.200 --> 17:12.720]  So put your reservoir in a good spot.
[17:12.720 --> 17:14.320]  Then have it near a plug.
[17:14.320 --> 17:17.360]  You're going to need to plug in at least that stir pump and then you're going to have
[17:17.360 --> 17:22.280]  a timer with another pump on it and that timer will be set to water at the intervals in which
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.440]  you tell it.
[17:23.440 --> 17:28.080]  Maybe you've got one of those Amazon smart plugs that you can tell pump from far away.
[17:28.080 --> 17:30.340]  Maybe you've got something, there are a lot of ways to set this up.
[17:30.340 --> 17:34.680]  You can set it up on a Smart Bee unit with a moisture sensor in your pot.
[17:34.680 --> 17:37.960]  When that moisture sensor says, Hey, this is too dry, it will trigger the Smart Bee
[17:37.960 --> 17:39.760]  unit to actually water your plants.
[17:39.760 --> 17:42.640]  There are a lot of ways to set up the triggering of the watering.
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.960]  A real easy way to do it is to put on a timer and tell it every morning at nine o'clock
[17:46.960 --> 17:50.800]  water for 45 seconds or two minutes or however long it takes.
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.280]  They'll come on, they'll water, then it'll shut off.
[17:53.280 --> 17:56.760]  There are timers you can buy to do just about any sort of program you want.
[17:56.760 --> 18:01.100]  You can tell it every Wednesday, come on, every Wednesday and Friday, come on, set the
[18:01.100 --> 18:02.100]  timer how you want it.
[18:02.100 --> 18:03.100]  So you're going to need a timer.
[18:03.100 --> 18:06.400]  So you've got your main pump that goes inside of the reservoir.
[18:06.400 --> 18:11.720]  Then you've got flex tubing that comes from your main pump that goes up and out of the
[18:11.800 --> 18:14.440]  trash can or whatever reservoir you've used.
[18:14.440 --> 18:16.760]  Back down, I run it across the floor.
[18:16.760 --> 18:20.080]  If I'm using tables, I run it along the edge of the tables.
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.080]  Most personal growers are just going to do the floor or however your tables or your plants
[18:24.080 --> 18:25.080]  are raised.
[18:25.080 --> 18:27.080]  Anyway, I'm coming out of the trash can down to the floor.
[18:27.080 --> 18:30.160]  Then I've got a line that goes across the middle of the floor.
[18:30.160 --> 18:33.440]  Then it separates into, I make a loop out of it.
[18:33.440 --> 18:35.600]  Let me explain what I mean by making a loop.
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.640]  I don't want one straight line going down the room with lines coming off of that to
[18:40.640 --> 18:45.680]  water the plants because the pressure toward the end will start losing pressure and all
[18:45.680 --> 18:47.720]  the plants at the front will get the most water.
[18:47.720 --> 18:48.720]  The water will come out.
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.940]  It'll take the path of least resistance.
[18:50.940 --> 18:54.800]  So I make a loop and the loop will equalize the pressure.
[18:54.800 --> 18:56.880]  My line comes off of my pump.
[18:56.880 --> 18:59.240]  I've got a, I use thick flex hosing.
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.640]  I think it's a three quarters of an inch, maybe a half inch in diameter, but I'm watering
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.960]  a lot more plants than you.
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.000]  So get the diameter of tubing you think will be necessary to move the amount of water you
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  need to move.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.560]  That's how big your grow is.
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.480]  Get the flex tube, go from the Monty pump out of the reservoir across the grow room
[19:16.480 --> 19:17.640]  floor.
[19:17.640 --> 19:21.300]  Then I will cut it and make a T intersection at this point.
[19:21.300 --> 19:25.560]  So there's a cap that goes on it and it is a T. Now my main line is coming out of the
[19:25.560 --> 19:30.840]  reservoir and going straight across the floor to a T. Now I will build a square.
[19:30.840 --> 19:36.060]  I've got just a perfect square of tubing that lies right in the middle of my room and then
[19:36.060 --> 19:38.480]  that perfect square just loops back to itself.
[19:38.720 --> 19:41.200]  So you've got a T that comes out and a square.
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.880]  I can't describe it any more simply.
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.560]  My hose comes off straight and then it branches out to a T and then it goes up and then it
[19:47.560 --> 19:48.560]  comes back in.
[19:48.560 --> 19:50.900]  So you've got a straight line with a square at the end of it.
[19:50.900 --> 19:54.880]  The reason for the square, I've said this a moment ago, is to equalize that pressure.
[19:54.880 --> 19:59.000]  This way we're going to get this same amount of water flow through every emitter.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.360]  That way you don't get a couple of emitters that spray real hard and a few at the end
[20:02.360 --> 20:03.760]  that are not spraying very well.
[20:03.760 --> 20:06.320]  I like the equalization by building the square.
[20:06.320 --> 20:10.880]  It works very well for me and I've seen it work better than just the one straight line.
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.440]  So you've got your square that goes along the floor.
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.840]  Measure it to where you're not going to have to run a bunch of spaghetti string to every
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.160]  plant that's too long, but every plant will need at least one or two spaghetti emitters
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.980]  that we'll talk about in a minute.
[20:23.980 --> 20:27.520]  So you've got your pump in your reservoir.
[20:27.520 --> 20:31.480]  You've got your main line that runs out across the floor to get closer to the plants.
[20:31.480 --> 20:33.760]  You've got your big square laid out on the floor.
[20:33.760 --> 20:36.520]  The plants are now arranged around that square.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.040]  This is where I use...
[20:39.040 --> 20:41.080]  There are so many options for these products.
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.340]  I'm not sure where you're going.
[20:42.340 --> 20:45.360]  If you're going to shop at a local hardware store, if you're going to shop at the big
[20:45.360 --> 20:49.280]  orange box or the big blue box store, I'm not sure if you're going to order it online.
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.000]  There's a great online website to order all of your hydroponics parts.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.760]  But I like to use...
[20:55.760 --> 20:59.000]  There's a little tool that you poke a hole in the main tube with.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  You just puncture it.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.520]  And then there are spaghetti emitters that are already pre-assembled that I like to buy.
[21:05.520 --> 21:08.920]  They've got a barb on one end and a long skinny tube.
[21:08.920 --> 21:12.720]  And then at the other end, there is an emitter.
[21:12.720 --> 21:14.440]  It hooks to the...
[21:14.440 --> 21:18.120]  One end hooks to the tubing, and then it's kind of shaped like a question mark or a half
[21:18.120 --> 21:19.120]  moon.
[21:19.120 --> 21:23.080]  And what happens is the water goes up the question mark to the top, and then...
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.480]  No, the water comes out of the bottom and it sprays the top half of the question mark.
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.240]  And as it sprays the top half of the question mark, it makes the water spread into an umbrella-like
[21:32.240 --> 21:38.200]  pattern, which gives our plants a nice, wet, even consistency on the whole top of the pot.
[21:38.200 --> 21:39.840]  So I'm going to try to explain that again.
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.440]  We've got the Mondi pump.
[21:41.440 --> 21:45.960]  Then we've got main tubing that runs across the floor, goes to where the plants are, goes
[21:45.960 --> 21:47.000]  into a loop system.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.920]  I make a big square.
[21:48.920 --> 21:53.320]  Then from that big square, I will puncture holes with the tool that is sold.
[21:53.320 --> 21:55.640]  If you go to the hardware store, it'll be in this department.
[21:55.680 --> 21:58.080]  You'll be able to find the puncture tool.
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.600]  Then after you've punctured the holes, they sell little barbs that go into those punctures.
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.680]  They fit perfectly into that puncture.
[22:04.680 --> 22:06.840]  You pop that little barb in there, it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[22:06.840 --> 22:08.640]  Your fingers are going to be sore.
[22:08.640 --> 22:11.680]  Then attached to that barb is what I call spaghetti line.
[22:11.680 --> 22:14.640]  This is the actual emitter line that runs to the plant.
[22:14.640 --> 22:16.920]  Then on the other end of that is the emitter.
[22:16.920 --> 22:17.920]  The water...
[22:17.920 --> 22:22.000]  The emitter connects to the tubing, and then it's got kind of that C...
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  It's a C-shape.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  And it sprays out of the bottom.
[22:24.320 --> 22:27.720]  When it hits the top of the C, it's got a little cup up there that makes the water spray
[22:27.720 --> 22:29.680]  back down in a pattern.
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.680]  Also, on that emitter, there are several different types you can find and buy.
[22:33.680 --> 22:37.480]  A lot of them have a stake that will fit directly into the pot.
[22:37.480 --> 22:40.280]  It's just a metal barb that you push right down into the pot.
[22:40.280 --> 22:47.000]  I like the metal stakes, just a simple metal, real thin aluminum, fucking just a piece of
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  metal.
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.680]  You don't need the big, thick plastic pieces.
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.460]  They don't need to be super strong.
[22:51.460 --> 22:55.620]  It's actually easier and less damage to the plant, easier to get it in if you use that
[22:55.620 --> 22:58.500]  skinny, just fucking little thin, shitty piece of aluminum.
[22:58.500 --> 23:01.820]  It looks like it's about the diameter of a piece of a stick of incense.
[23:01.820 --> 23:03.580]  You can slide that really easily into your pot.
[23:03.580 --> 23:06.980]  It's a thick, fucking a thick paper clip, basically.
[23:06.980 --> 23:11.820]  So the emitter sits on that, slides down into the end of the pot, and now it's just held
[23:11.820 --> 23:15.140]  in place by the soil and by that stick.
[23:15.140 --> 23:20.260]  So the basic, you've got your reservoir with your Mondi pump.
[23:20.540 --> 23:23.300]  Then you've got your flex tubing that runs to the plants.
[23:23.300 --> 23:25.580]  Then you've got a T to build yourself a square.
[23:25.580 --> 23:27.820]  You're going to need a T and four corners.
[23:27.820 --> 23:31.620]  You can use PVC pipe for the big square, but I prefer the flex tubing because you're going
[23:31.620 --> 23:32.620]  to kick it.
[23:32.620 --> 23:33.620]  You're going to bump it.
[23:33.620 --> 23:34.620]  The PVC will break.
[23:34.620 --> 23:38.460]  The flex tubing is much more durable, much more forgiving.
[23:38.460 --> 23:40.820]  So you've got your tubing on the floor.
[23:40.820 --> 23:43.700]  Then you're going to use the puncture tool to make holes.
[23:43.700 --> 23:45.300]  Then you'll stick the barb in there.
[23:45.300 --> 23:47.940]  Then you'll run the spaghetti line to your plant.
[23:47.940 --> 23:52.580]  You can put one or two emitters in your plant depending on how much water you want to get
[23:52.580 --> 23:54.220]  to that plant.
[23:54.220 --> 23:57.820]  Sometimes I'll have plants with one or two emitters and then I'll have a big ass plant
[23:57.820 --> 24:01.580]  right in the middle with like four emitters just because I didn't plan well and that one
[24:01.580 --> 24:03.140]  plant needs more water.
[24:03.140 --> 24:05.220]  So I got to put more water in there.
[24:05.220 --> 24:10.900]  Now that is the very basics of setting up a watering system, pump to tubing to a cube
[24:10.900 --> 24:15.540]  or a square to equalize the pressure to your emitters, to the plants.
[24:15.540 --> 24:16.660]  That is the basic setup.
[24:16.660 --> 24:21.020]  There are many options for parts and materials for this, but you've got to get what works
[24:21.020 --> 24:22.020]  best for you.
[24:22.020 --> 24:25.820]  Honestly, during the pandemic, parts and materials are limited.
[24:25.820 --> 24:27.980]  So get what is at the store.
[24:27.980 --> 24:30.540]  I understand you're going to want to buy stuff and have it shipped.
[24:30.540 --> 24:34.500]  Do that if that's the way to go, but try to buy what's there so that it's in your hands.
[24:34.500 --> 24:35.500]  You know what you're working with.
[24:35.500 --> 24:36.940]  You see all of the parts.
[24:36.940 --> 24:41.060]  Now once you've got it built, and I know that was a very brief description on how to build
[24:41.060 --> 24:42.260]  it, but I don't know what you're going to do.
[24:42.260 --> 24:46.380]  You're going to have to kind of engineer the details to work for your grow.
[24:46.380 --> 24:47.860]  Here's what I can talk about though.
[24:47.860 --> 24:51.220]  Once you've got it built, you're going to have to test it.
[24:51.220 --> 24:54.060]  I said before, it's really easy to auto water the floor.
[24:54.060 --> 24:55.660]  It's really easy to over auto water.
[24:55.660 --> 24:57.140]  It's really easy to under auto water.
[24:57.140 --> 25:00.660]  So you're going to have to get this tested and dial it in.
[25:00.660 --> 25:05.340]  A good way to do it, pay attention before you even build the auto watering system.
[25:05.340 --> 25:08.640]  How much water does each plant get and how often?
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.860]  That shouldn't be too hard to figure out when you're watering your plants today or tomorrow
[25:11.860 --> 25:14.100]  before you build a watering system.
[25:14.100 --> 25:15.100]  Water the plant.
[25:15.100 --> 25:17.860]  See how much it takes just before runoff.
[25:17.860 --> 25:21.100]  Maybe fill up a one gallon container, pour half of it in there.
[25:21.100 --> 25:22.380]  See if you get runoff.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.500]  Pour three quarters in there.
[25:23.500 --> 25:24.500]  See if you get runoff.
[25:24.500 --> 25:25.860]  Pour the whole thing in there.
[25:25.860 --> 25:27.180]  See if you get runoff.
[25:27.180 --> 25:31.780]  See how much of that gallon it takes until you get some runoff inside of your pot.
[25:31.780 --> 25:32.980]  I'm having a weird microphone issue.
[25:32.980 --> 25:33.980]  Thing just started moving.
[25:33.980 --> 25:34.980]  Oh, there we go.
[25:34.980 --> 25:35.980]  That's where it is.
[25:35.980 --> 25:36.980]  All right.
[25:36.980 --> 25:37.980]  Anyway, I'm back on track.
[25:37.980 --> 25:38.980]  See how much water it takes to get that plant to runoff.
[25:38.980 --> 25:40.600]  Document that.
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.840]  And the next thing we need to do is set up the auto watering system, fill it up with
[25:45.840 --> 25:46.840]  water.
[25:46.840 --> 25:49.880]  Then you're going to have to put those emitters somewhere.
[25:49.880 --> 25:51.440]  I'm not sure how you're going to test this.
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.560]  Put them all in the plants if the plants aren't already soaked.
[25:54.560 --> 25:57.520]  Get one of the emitters and put it in your pitcher.
[25:57.520 --> 26:01.920]  Press go on that timer or just plug in the pump so that the pump starts spitting out
[26:01.920 --> 26:02.920]  the water.
[26:02.920 --> 26:06.200]  See how long it takes to fill up that gallon of water.
[26:06.200 --> 26:08.960]  That's how long you're going to want to leave or however much water.
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.080]  If it takes three quarters of a gallon, let it fill up to three quarters of a gallon.
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.080]  Time it.
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.080]  See how long that takes.
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.600]  That is how long you're going to want to leave the timer on to water your plants.
[26:19.600 --> 26:25.040]  If your plants need three quarters of a gallon, you put that emitter in an empty gallon, turn
[26:25.040 --> 26:27.040]  it on and see how long it takes to fill that up.
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.040]  Now we know how long it takes for your emitters to spit out three quarters of a gallon.
[26:31.040 --> 26:33.120]  Go and put an emitter in every single plant.
[26:33.120 --> 26:34.520]  Have them all set up and ready to go.
[26:34.520 --> 26:36.040]  Have the reservoir mixed up.
[26:36.040 --> 26:37.040]  pH balance.
[26:37.040 --> 26:38.880]  The EC is correct.
[26:38.880 --> 26:42.640]  Then when the plants are thirsty again, I would do it manually the first time.
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.400]  I would go in there and plug in that pump, hit go on the timer and watch.
[26:46.400 --> 26:48.760]  Maybe it takes a minute and 42 seconds.
[26:48.760 --> 26:51.840]  Maybe it takes two minutes and 17 seconds, but watch it.
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.080]  When the amount of time that you timed it is up, unplug it.
[26:55.080 --> 26:56.860]  Then go investigate the plants.
[26:56.860 --> 26:57.920]  Are they watered enough?
[26:57.920 --> 26:59.140]  Are they saturated?
[26:59.140 --> 27:01.040]  Are all of the plants equally watered?
[27:01.040 --> 27:02.220]  Are you happy with the work?
[27:02.220 --> 27:04.560]  Now it's time to make adjustments.
[27:04.560 --> 27:06.000]  Do we need to water longer?
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.620]  Do we need to water shorter?
[27:07.620 --> 27:11.540]  Now the thing to figure out is how long before my next water?
[27:11.540 --> 27:17.220]  You know that the plants need three quarters of a gallon of water every 72 hours.
[27:17.220 --> 27:21.780]  You set it up to water for two minutes and 17 seconds every 72 hours.
[27:21.780 --> 27:26.180]  They will get the most consistent, most even waterings those plants have ever had.
[27:26.180 --> 27:29.380]  They will show you their gratitude.
[27:29.380 --> 27:32.140]  They will start jumping on that schedule.
[27:32.140 --> 27:33.660]  You'll go, oh, the plants need water.
[27:33.660 --> 27:34.900]  Then you'll hear the pump click on.
[27:34.900 --> 27:36.980]  You'll go, man, we're so in sync.
[27:36.980 --> 27:38.100]  Everything's right on rhythm.
[27:38.100 --> 27:40.020]  It is a beautiful thing to set up.
[27:40.020 --> 27:41.020]  You've got to test it.
[27:41.020 --> 27:42.500]  You've got to dial it in.
[27:42.500 --> 27:45.140]  Don't build this system and then leave town.
[27:45.140 --> 27:49.740]  Build this system, run it for one or two weeks while you're there watching it, then leave
[27:49.740 --> 27:50.740]  town.
[27:50.740 --> 27:52.180]  It's going to need maintenance.
[27:52.180 --> 27:56.860]  If you're feeding big, thick, chunky, veg bloom, powdered nutrients, you're going to
[27:56.860 --> 27:59.740]  need a filter in your setup at some point.
[27:59.740 --> 28:03.980]  You've got your pump, and then you've got a little bit of flex tube going up.
[28:03.980 --> 28:07.900]  They make a filter that goes in the way that will catch all of the solids that haven't
[28:07.900 --> 28:12.740]  been dissolved properly because those things are going to clog up your emitters.
[28:12.740 --> 28:14.460]  You're going to need to clean the pump.
[28:14.460 --> 28:16.060]  You will need to clean the filter.
[28:16.060 --> 28:18.460]  You will need to clean the emitters.
[28:18.460 --> 28:23.380]  What I would do when I ran the commercial facility every couple of days, I'd get a brand
[28:23.380 --> 28:27.420]  new baggie of the emitters, or I would get the freshly cleaned emitters and walk the
[28:27.420 --> 28:28.420]  room.
[28:28.420 --> 28:32.540]  If I see one that's not spraying properly, I can unscrew it and screw another one in
[28:32.540 --> 28:35.540]  while the plants are getting watered and not mess anything up too badly.
[28:35.540 --> 28:38.100]  I would get wet and make a little spray, but it's a commercial grow.
[28:38.100 --> 28:39.100]  I'm at work.
[28:39.100 --> 28:40.100]  That's how it's going to go.
[28:40.100 --> 28:42.860]  I just walk the rows and replace the emitters as I go.
[28:42.860 --> 28:45.860]  I'd have a bucket full of deads and a bucket full of freshies.
[28:45.860 --> 28:50.660]  That bucket full of dead emitters would get thrown into a container of H2O2.
[28:50.660 --> 28:54.500]  When somebody's got time, they'll go through and use a little pokey and poke all the sediment
[28:54.500 --> 28:56.220]  out of all of those emitters.
[28:56.220 --> 29:00.020]  We just keep recycling them and recycling until eventually they do break when we poke
[29:00.020 --> 29:02.940]  them out because they get brittle from all the use.
[29:02.940 --> 29:05.580]  Maintenance, make sure you clean the filter.
[29:05.580 --> 29:07.340]  Make sure you clean the pump.
[29:07.340 --> 29:11.740]  Make sure you do clean those emitters because they will get funky over time.
[29:11.740 --> 29:16.860]  You're going to need to be mindful of the nutrients you feed through your auto watering
[29:16.860 --> 29:17.860]  system.
[29:17.860 --> 29:20.740]  Not all things are going to be good for your emitters and for your pump.
[29:20.740 --> 29:26.620]  I've noticed that some of the carbo load, carbonaria, will absolutely clog the shit
[29:26.620 --> 29:27.620]  out of those emitters.
[29:27.620 --> 29:28.620]  It's gooey.
[29:28.620 --> 29:29.620]  It's funky.
[29:30.100 --> 29:31.100]  Get that out of there.
[29:31.100 --> 29:33.620]  If you're going to run that, maybe run a little bit of clean water through the lines right
[29:33.620 --> 29:35.580]  after just to rinse them out.
[29:35.580 --> 29:38.820]  Also between grows, make sure you're cleaning all of your new equipment.
[29:38.820 --> 29:42.300]  You've got a whole new setup of stuff to clean out between grows.
[29:42.300 --> 29:44.420]  Flush it out with some clean water.
[29:44.420 --> 29:46.060]  Maybe run a cleaning product through there.
[29:46.060 --> 29:49.460]  Then make sure you clean it out really well before you feed the plants with that system
[29:49.460 --> 29:50.460]  again.
[29:50.460 --> 29:51.900]  It's going to require more upkeep.
[29:51.900 --> 29:54.620]  This is another step that you're going to have to clean.
[29:54.620 --> 29:57.300]  Let me look down at my notes because I haven't looked at the notes in a long time.
[29:57.300 --> 29:59.300]  I want to make sure I got all of this stuff.
[29:59.340 --> 30:02.020]  Barbed emitters, lines and emitters, a timer.
[30:02.020 --> 30:03.300]  You're going to need a timer.
[30:03.300 --> 30:05.060]  The timer is going to be critical.
[30:05.060 --> 30:06.420]  Learn how to set that timer.
[30:06.420 --> 30:07.800]  I mentioned it before.
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.900]  Maybe the plants want two minutes and 17 seconds worth of water every 72 hours.
[30:11.900 --> 30:16.420]  You're going to need a timer that will do that for you or one of those Amazon smart
[30:16.420 --> 30:17.580]  plugs.
[30:17.580 --> 30:19.300]  Maybe you've got a camera in the grow room.
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.440]  This would be ideal.
[30:20.440 --> 30:25.260]  You've got some sort of a monitor that tells you the VPD in the room, maybe a monitor that
[30:25.260 --> 30:29.620]  tells you the moisture level of the medium cocoa soil, whatever you're working with,
[30:29.620 --> 30:32.180]  and a camera and an Amazon smart plug.
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.620]  Then you can get a notification.
[30:33.620 --> 30:35.260]  Hey, you should water.
[30:35.260 --> 30:36.540]  You can look at the video.
[30:36.540 --> 30:38.520]  You can say, yep, it's right.
[30:38.520 --> 30:39.520]  It's time to water.
[30:39.520 --> 30:43.360]  And then you can press a button on your Amazon smart plug and those plants will get their
[30:43.360 --> 30:45.980]  required watering and you can watch it all happen.
[30:45.980 --> 30:49.980]  It is such a glorious feeling being away from the grow and watching shit happen.
[30:49.980 --> 30:53.580]  I love watching the commercial grow go when nobody is there.
[30:54.100 --> 30:54.600]  All right.
[30:54.600 --> 30:59.500]  So then make sure that you are adjusting pH before you leave and make sure that that pH
[30:59.500 --> 31:01.540]  is staying where you like it.
[31:01.540 --> 31:02.540]  Maybe experiment.
[31:02.540 --> 31:04.980]  Maybe before you go out of town, mix up the nutrients.
[31:04.980 --> 31:09.080]  Practice with this a bunch of times, but keep checking the pH and see how it swings because
[31:09.080 --> 31:12.180]  maybe it'll rise, maybe it'll fall while you're gone.
[31:12.180 --> 31:14.260]  Water is going to evaporate.
[31:14.260 --> 31:15.660]  Water is going to be used.
[31:15.660 --> 31:16.780]  The pH may swing.
[31:16.780 --> 31:21.940]  You may have to adjust your pH a point or two higher or lower than you normally would
[31:22.060 --> 31:25.700]  to compensate for what's going to happen over the next week while you're gone.
[31:25.700 --> 31:28.220]  That's something people don't think about.
[31:28.220 --> 31:29.540]  Adjust that pH.
[31:29.540 --> 31:30.620]  Mix up your newts.
[31:30.620 --> 31:32.860]  Get your pH in there, your EC right.
[31:32.860 --> 31:34.180]  Keep those nutrients moving.
[31:34.180 --> 31:37.780]  Have that pump down in the bottom of the reservoir.
[31:37.780 --> 31:43.740]  That pump can be attached to the timer that triggers the feeding.
[31:43.740 --> 31:46.060]  That will start stirring it while it's feeding.
[31:46.060 --> 31:49.980]  I would rather it be stirring all the time, but I understand that's another pump, another
[31:49.980 --> 31:50.980]  plug.
[31:51.780 --> 31:55.020]  Maybe plugging both of the pumps into the same timer will be beneficial, would work
[31:55.020 --> 31:59.700]  better for you, but still make sure you're stirring your stuff.
[31:59.700 --> 32:00.700]  Set your timer.
[32:00.700 --> 32:02.420]  Give it a couple of test runs.
[32:02.420 --> 32:07.140]  Dial in what needs to be dialed in and then let it rock and go on vacation with confidence.
[32:07.140 --> 32:10.380]  Hopefully, nothing goes wrong.
[32:10.380 --> 32:12.020]  Maybe I shouldn't tell you about the shit that I've seen wrong.
[32:12.020 --> 32:14.500]  I've seen emitters blow clean out of the lines.
[32:14.500 --> 32:17.500]  I've seen the pumps completely come undone and the water shoots straight up into the
[32:17.500 --> 32:18.500]  air.
[32:18.500 --> 32:19.740]  I've seen the pumps freeze.
[32:19.780 --> 32:25.500]  I've driven 45 minutes in the snow on a holiday because I watched a pump freeze up as it started
[32:25.500 --> 32:29.380]  and I knew that a whole section of plants at a commercial grow wasn't going to get watered,
[32:29.380 --> 32:30.940]  so I had to go rescue that.
[32:30.940 --> 32:31.940]  That's a fun story.
[32:31.940 --> 32:34.820]  Car broke down in the snowstorm during that one.
[32:34.820 --> 32:37.380]  That's how you know I'm a goddamn grow room hero.
[32:37.380 --> 32:43.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[32:43.220 --> 32:49.220]  growers, trimmers, packagers, the grow team, the lead growers, the home growers, I want
[32:49.220 --> 32:50.440]  to thank you guys for listening.
[32:50.440 --> 32:51.440]  This was a fun episode.
[32:51.440 --> 32:53.100]  I had a good time doing this one.
[32:53.100 --> 32:55.980]  I hope I gave you the info which you were looking for.
[32:55.980 --> 33:00.220]  I know that this was kind of vague, not a lot of super in-depth details, but you're
[33:00.220 --> 33:03.060]  going to have to build this project on your own.
[33:03.060 --> 33:09.620]  Pump, tubing, emitters, there are prefabricated setups available online.
[33:09.620 --> 33:13.340]  Maybe you can use those as a guide to give you a guideline of what you need to do, what
[33:13.340 --> 33:17.060]  you do and don't want, but I hope I gave you the info that you need.
[33:17.060 --> 33:18.520]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[33:18.520 --> 33:21.960]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know that my email
[33:21.960 --> 33:24.920]  address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
