[02:29.710 --> 02:33.350]  for leaving a comment on the Stitcher channel.
[02:33.350 --> 02:34.510]  Sorry, I'm coughing from a dab.
[02:34.510 --> 02:35.990]  It's got me all choked up.
[02:35.990 --> 02:38.030]  Brad, your comment has me choked up, bro.
[02:39.150 --> 02:42.270]  I met Brad at a dab festival at the Wright Event Center.
[02:42.270 --> 02:44.230]  It was either the 710 Cup or the Secret Cup
[02:44.230 --> 02:45.150]  or one of those.
[02:45.150 --> 02:45.990]  He's a photographer.
[02:45.990 --> 02:47.050]  He takes great photos.
[02:47.050 --> 02:49.710]  My current Twitter picture was actually taken by Brad.
[02:49.710 --> 02:51.470]  So thanks for taking good pictures, dude.
[02:51.470 --> 02:53.130]  Thanks for being a good member of the community.
[02:53.130 --> 02:55.990]  He comes all the way from New Mexico to Denver
[02:55.990 --> 02:58.270]  to all of the dab parties and the cannabis events.
[02:58.270 --> 02:59.550]  So that is fucking cool of you.
[02:59.550 --> 03:00.390]  Thanks a lot, man.
[03:00.390 --> 03:02.050]  I appreciate that.

[03:11.710 --> 03:13.190]  if you don't wanna leave your name in a comment,
[03:13.190 --> 03:15.350]  if you wanna be read on the show but remain anonymous,

[03:18.350 --> 03:20.390]  or send me a private message on Facebook.
[03:20.390 --> 03:21.470]  I won't say your name on the show,
[03:21.470 --> 03:22.630]  but I'll get your question out there.
[03:22.630 --> 03:23.910]  If you're in a place where people can't know
[03:23.910 --> 03:25.350]  you're a cannabis user,
[03:25.350 --> 03:26.430]  we'll go ahead and read your question
[03:26.430 --> 03:28.490]  without anybody knowing it came from you.
[03:29.590 --> 03:33.230]  We are going to do a grow lesson on this episode.
[03:33.230 --> 03:35.070]  I wanna talk about something real quick before we do that.
[03:35.070 --> 03:36.630]  I've been putting out these flyers
[03:36.630 --> 03:37.850]  for the I Grow Culture podcast.
[03:37.850 --> 03:39.030]  My friend Adam puts them out for me.
[03:39.030 --> 03:40.990]  Shout out to Adam, thanks a lot, bro.
[03:40.990 --> 03:42.110]  He puts these little flyers.
[03:42.110 --> 03:43.270]  They're just the size,
[03:43.270 --> 03:44.270]  a quarter sheet of paper says,
[03:44.270 --> 03:45.870]  listen to the I Grow Culture podcast
[03:45.870 --> 03:48.070]  for free grow lessons and cannabis news.
[03:48.070 --> 03:49.150]  Something funny that happened.
[03:49.150 --> 03:51.030]  We did that episode at the hookah bar
[03:51.030 --> 03:53.390]  and I left a few of those there on the table.
[03:53.390 --> 03:55.730]  And the police had been going to that hookah bar randomly,
[03:55.730 --> 03:57.550]  trying to bust people smoking weed there.
[03:57.550 --> 03:58.510]  And it's not happening.
[03:58.510 --> 04:00.230]  But the only thing they found
[04:00.230 --> 04:02.510]  are these I Grow Culture podcast flyers
[04:02.510 --> 04:04.270]  with a weed leaf on there.
[04:04.270 --> 04:06.750]  And they insist that that is some sort of code
[04:06.750 --> 04:09.450]  to like get weed or something somewhere.
[04:09.450 --> 04:10.550]  And it's not, guys.
[04:10.550 --> 04:13.410]  If you took the time to scan the QR code
[04:13.410 --> 04:14.910]  that is on that flyer,
[04:14.910 --> 04:17.150]  it brought you to this podcast.
[04:17.150 --> 04:18.230]  Oh God, sorry, I'm coughing
[04:18.230 --> 04:20.050]  because I took a dab in the privacy of my own home,
[04:20.050 --> 04:22.230]  like I'm allowed to do as a Colorado resident.
[04:22.230 --> 04:23.990]  But if the cops are listening to this show,
[04:23.990 --> 04:24.990]  the QR code worked,
[04:24.990 --> 04:26.790]  the flyer did exactly what it was supposed to do.
[04:26.790 --> 04:28.690]  It was an ad to get people to listen to the podcast.
[04:28.690 --> 04:30.190]  So I think it's really hilarious.
[04:30.190 --> 04:31.230]  They thought a little,
[04:31.230 --> 04:33.190]  it's just a flyer that says to listen to a show.
[04:33.230 --> 04:35.510]  They thought that was some sort of code
[04:35.510 --> 04:37.070]  to get you some free weed.
[04:37.070 --> 04:38.630]  That's really funny.
[04:38.630 --> 04:39.470]  Inaccurate, guys.
[04:39.470 --> 04:40.870]  Great police work there.
[04:40.870 --> 04:42.510]  All right, I obviously can't breathe
[04:42.510 --> 04:43.550]  from the dab that I just took.
[04:43.550 --> 04:44.750]  So give me a second to take a drink
[04:44.750 --> 04:45.590]  and I'll be right back.
[04:45.590 --> 04:47.670]  We'll read some news and we will get on with it
[04:47.670 --> 04:48.510]  with a Grow Lesson.
[04:48.510 --> 04:49.350]  Hang out, guys.
[04:50.750 --> 04:52.670]  All right, guys, I think I've recovered from those dabs.
[04:52.670 --> 04:53.710]  I got a nice drink of water.
[04:53.710 --> 04:55.070]  Got nice and comfortable.
[04:55.070 --> 04:57.590]  I wanna read you a news article that comes from Colorado.
[04:57.590 --> 05:00.050]  This is actually written in the cannabis again
[05:00.050 --> 05:02.510]  from our good friend, Ricardo Baca.
[05:02.510 --> 05:03.350]  The headline is,
[05:03.350 --> 05:06.430]  Edibles Recall, At-Home Baked Use of Washing Machine
[05:06.430 --> 05:08.390]  for Hash Questioned.
[05:08.390 --> 05:09.230]  And it says,
[05:09.230 --> 05:10.910]  the popular Denver-based brand
[05:10.910 --> 05:12.990]  of marijuana-infused edibles was recalled
[05:12.990 --> 05:15.790]  by Denver Department of Environmental Health on July 17th
[05:15.790 --> 05:17.550]  because of the possible contamination
[05:17.550 --> 05:20.390]  from unsanitary equipment and use of equipment
[05:20.390 --> 05:22.350]  not intended for food manufacturing,
[05:22.350 --> 05:23.350]  according to the department's
[05:23.350 --> 05:25.510]  Public Health Inspections Division.
[05:25.510 --> 05:27.790]  The manufacturer of the recalled edibles, At-Home Baked,
[05:27.790 --> 05:29.910]  operates on the same state marijuana license
[05:29.910 --> 05:32.830]  as dispensary group Advanced Medical Alternatives.
[05:32.830 --> 05:35.230]  We're really frustrated with the entire situation,
[05:35.230 --> 05:36.630]  said AJ Hashkar.
[05:36.630 --> 05:39.790]  AJ Ashkar, sorry, he's also known to me as AJ Hashman.
[05:39.790 --> 05:40.670]  That's what I would always call him.
[05:40.670 --> 05:43.510]  So I said, I saw Ashkar and I just said Hashkar
[05:43.510 --> 05:45.110]  because it seemed like it worked.
[05:45.110 --> 05:47.030]  But anyway, the co-owner of At-Home Baked,
[05:47.030 --> 05:50.230]  who is known in the Denver marijuana industry as AJ Hashman,
[05:50.230 --> 05:51.390]  they came in and the machine
[05:51.390 --> 05:53.190]  which we're utilizing to make water hash
[05:53.190 --> 05:56.510]  was not a food-safe machine.
[05:56.510 --> 05:59.590]  Food-safe machines to make water hash do not exist.
[06:00.270 --> 06:01.110]  They deemed the water hash
[06:01.110 --> 06:03.270]  that we were making unfit for human consumption,
[06:03.270 --> 06:06.470]  even though nobody has gotten sick from our hash.
[06:06.470 --> 06:08.430]  The Department of Environmental Health verified
[06:08.430 --> 06:10.870]  that there haven't been any reports of illness yet,
[06:10.870 --> 06:13.630]  but a food safety inspection was the reason for the recall.
[06:13.630 --> 06:15.910]  Ashkar has been using a modified washing machine
[06:15.910 --> 06:17.230]  to activate his water hash,
[06:17.230 --> 06:19.270]  a common practice in this industry.
[06:19.270 --> 06:20.870]  To get the centrifugal action
[06:20.870 --> 06:23.350]  that is essential to the water hash, said Ashkar,
[06:23.350 --> 06:25.750]  also known for his popular marijuana meet and greets
[06:25.750 --> 06:27.630]  in Denver, Colorado.
[06:27.630 --> 06:29.070]  Dude, AJ throws some great parties.
[06:29.550 --> 06:30.390]  He hasn't been able to do them anymore
[06:30.390 --> 06:31.790]  because the Denver police
[06:31.790 --> 06:34.390]  have actually been shutting those parties down
[06:34.390 --> 06:37.950]  because we're smoking cannabis and not drinking alcohol.
[06:37.950 --> 06:39.150]  Anyway, the article says,
[06:39.150 --> 06:42.510]  my business partner and I both have culinary backgrounds,
[06:42.510 --> 06:43.550]  food service backgrounds,
[06:43.550 --> 06:45.350]  and we look at water hash as a concentrate,
[06:45.350 --> 06:47.190]  not a food, Ashkar said.
[06:47.190 --> 06:50.390]  But they say, as soon as you start working with it,
[06:50.390 --> 06:53.590]  with a food as the intent or the end result, it is food.
[06:54.550 --> 06:55.590]  Which I kind of agree with that.
[06:55.590 --> 06:56.550]  You know, it's gotta be food.
[06:56.550 --> 06:57.750]  We're going to eat that hash.
[06:57.750 --> 06:59.990]  That's the active ingredient that we're searching for.
[06:59.990 --> 07:01.310]  So it's gotta be clean.
[07:01.310 --> 07:02.790]  It's gotta be food grade.
[07:02.790 --> 07:04.510]  In June, Ashkar received a variance
[07:04.510 --> 07:06.630]  from the state through September
[07:06.630 --> 07:08.350]  to find a food safe alternative.
[07:08.350 --> 07:10.190]  And he purchased a bubble magic machine
[07:10.190 --> 07:12.750]  he hopes will satisfy their regulations.
[07:12.750 --> 07:14.110]  In the meantime, the state demanded
[07:14.110 --> 07:15.670]  that he recall all products made
[07:15.670 --> 07:17.470]  in his old washing machine.
[07:17.470 --> 07:20.350]  At-home baked products were recalled on July 17th.
[07:20.350 --> 07:22.670]  The at, sorry, let me reread that sentence for you.
[07:22.670 --> 07:24.510]  The at-home baked products
[07:24.510 --> 07:26.230]  that were recalled on July 17th
[07:26.230 --> 07:28.430]  include its infused brownie mixes,
[07:28.430 --> 07:31.990]  blondie mixes, rice crispy treats, and sticks candy.
[07:31.990 --> 07:33.270]  Sorry, I'm fired up on this episode.
[07:33.270 --> 07:34.110]  I'm going really fast
[07:34.110 --> 07:36.150]  because I want to get to that grow lesson.
[07:36.150 --> 07:36.990]  He continues to say,
[07:36.990 --> 07:38.630]  please pull our products off your shelf
[07:38.630 --> 07:41.950]  and place in the back room and contact me to replace them.
[07:41.950 --> 07:45.070]  At-home baked published on its Facebook on July 16th.
[07:45.070 --> 07:46.590]  So sorry for the inconvenience.
[07:46.590 --> 07:49.030]  We look forward to restocking you ASAP
[07:49.030 --> 07:51.750]  once we have more info and a timeframe.
[07:51.750 --> 07:54.190]  At-home baked will replace all products in question
[07:54.190 --> 07:56.230]  or refund purchases, Ashgar said.
[07:56.230 --> 07:58.070]  The department of environmental health is saying
[07:58.070 --> 08:00.270]  that any of the above at-home baked products
[08:00.270 --> 08:01.910]  should be removed from the retail shelves
[08:01.910 --> 08:03.310]  and destroyed immediately
[08:03.310 --> 08:08.310]  pursuant to state medical and retail marijuana regulations.
[08:08.350 --> 08:11.150]  But what does this mean for at-home bakes business?
[08:11.150 --> 08:13.590]  It's an extremely difficult blow, Ashgar said.
[08:13.590 --> 08:17.270]  It'll be difficult to keep our head above water.
[08:18.310 --> 08:20.030]  Man, that's rough times for AJ Hashman
[08:20.030 --> 08:22.150]  and the at-home baked company.
[08:22.150 --> 08:23.550]  I want to give a big shout out to AJ.
[08:24.470 --> 08:26.030]  He's been a huge supporter of this community.
[08:26.030 --> 08:27.310]  He actually threw those meet and greets
[08:27.310 --> 08:28.790]  like they were talking about.
[08:28.790 --> 08:30.590]  If you go to an event in Colorado,
[08:30.590 --> 08:31.630]  AJ has got a booth there.
[08:31.630 --> 08:32.670]  They're giving out sticks.
[08:32.670 --> 08:34.710]  They're giving out free samples.
[08:34.710 --> 08:35.630]  He's done a lot for us.
[08:35.630 --> 08:38.750]  So when he does get his products back on the shelf,
[08:38.750 --> 08:41.150]  somebody, one of the dispensaries needs to send them over
[08:41.150 --> 08:44.070]  to Steep Hill Halent Labs, get them tested,
[08:44.070 --> 08:46.910]  get the profile printed out, post that online,
[08:46.910 --> 08:48.270]  show what he's got going on.
[08:48.270 --> 08:49.590]  And then we should all go buy those
[08:49.590 --> 08:50.830]  if it's a good product again.
[08:50.830 --> 08:53.070]  And we should support AJ to help him get back on his feet.
[08:53.590 --> 08:54.670]  Because this is a big blow for a small company
[08:54.670 --> 08:56.270]  like what AJ's got going on.
[08:57.830 --> 08:59.230]  I want to make the news real quick.
[08:59.230 --> 09:00.590]  There's only one news article this week
[09:00.590 --> 09:02.070]  because I want to get to the Grow Lesson.
[09:02.070 --> 09:04.470]  I have got quite a bit of information
[09:04.470 --> 09:06.470]  that I want to kind of cram into
[09:06.470 --> 09:08.870]  just a little bit of time here.
[09:08.870 --> 09:10.430]  So I'm scrolling through my notes.
[09:10.430 --> 09:14.470]  And before we do that, I need to give another shout out.
[09:14.470 --> 09:16.710]  This portion of the podcast, the Grow Lesson,
[09:16.710 --> 09:19.430]  is brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[09:19.430 --> 09:21.550]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[09:21.590 --> 09:22.470]  to serve Colorado.
[09:22.470 --> 09:25.670]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street, Unit F,
[09:25.670 --> 09:27.750]  or stop by the new Pueblo location
[09:27.750 --> 09:31.550]  on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[09:31.550 --> 09:33.550]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
[09:33.550 --> 09:35.910]  and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[09:35.910 --> 09:39.310]  Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver.com
[09:39.310 --> 09:42.030]  for current store hours and special sales.
[09:42.030 --> 09:43.750]  Go check out the new location in Pueblo.
[09:43.750 --> 09:45.430]  Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[09:45.430 --> 09:47.150]  They like to know that I'm sending people.
[09:47.150 --> 09:49.030]  And that means they know you're listening to the podcast,
[09:49.030 --> 09:51.270]  it knows their advertising dollars are going.
[09:51.990 --> 09:53.990]  All right, let's get down to a grow lesson.
[09:53.990 --> 09:57.550]  A few weeks ago, we cut some clones, we germinated seeds,
[09:57.550 --> 10:00.070]  and then we put those seedlings and clones into cups
[10:00.070 --> 10:01.110]  to let them develop roots.
[10:01.110 --> 10:03.790]  So it's probably, on the time schedule I've been on,
[10:03.790 --> 10:05.830]  it's probably past time to get those into pots
[10:05.830 --> 10:07.190]  and start the vegetative phase.
[10:07.190 --> 10:09.750]  So I apologize if I'm a little behind schedule.
[10:09.750 --> 10:12.510]  I've had a lot of podcasting to try to cram in.
[10:12.510 --> 10:15.790]  Anyway, let's talk about the size pots we're gonna use.
[10:15.790 --> 10:17.110]  I like to go straight into the pots
[10:17.110 --> 10:18.390]  that I'm going to finish in,
[10:18.430 --> 10:22.070]  like what I transplant into now from the cups
[10:22.070 --> 10:23.950]  is going to be our finished pot.
[10:23.950 --> 10:25.390]  So we were in cups.
[10:26.510 --> 10:27.350]  We're gonna go into pots.
[10:27.350 --> 10:30.150]  Choosing your pot size is an important thing to consider.
[10:30.150 --> 10:32.350]  I like to run my test plants in three gallon pots
[10:32.350 --> 10:35.230]  and my big plants in seven gallon pots.
[10:35.230 --> 10:36.630]  Some of you guys like to go even bigger,
[10:36.630 --> 10:37.470]  but for an indoor crop,
[10:37.470 --> 10:39.550]  I think a seven gallon pot is plenty large enough.
[10:39.550 --> 10:43.150]  If you're going outside, shit, you can go 50 to 100,
[10:43.150 --> 10:46.550]  or I've seen 250 gallon pots outside, earth pots,
[10:46.550 --> 10:47.870]  but if you're going that big,
[10:48.350 --> 10:49.790]  you should just go into the ground, I think.
[10:49.790 --> 10:51.870]  Anyway, I think I'm rambling.
[10:51.870 --> 10:53.950]  Three to five gallon pots are great for vegging plants
[10:53.950 --> 10:55.310]  for a few weeks and then flowering.
[10:55.310 --> 10:57.710]  I don't like to let them veg in three gallon pots
[10:57.710 --> 11:00.070]  for longer than like 45 days or so.
[11:00.070 --> 11:01.710]  Once the plants start to get too big for that,
[11:01.710 --> 11:03.510]  they'll get a little bit root bound.
[11:03.510 --> 11:05.510]  So if you want to veg your plants for more time
[11:05.510 --> 11:08.830]  to get bigger plants and bigger buds, use larger pots.
[11:08.830 --> 11:11.030]  If I want to run a fast crop,
[11:11.030 --> 11:15.390]  I run about 16 three gallon pots under a thousand watt light.
[11:15.390 --> 11:16.430]  These are usually from seed.
[11:16.430 --> 11:17.910]  If I'm running like a little tester crop
[11:17.910 --> 11:19.230]  is what I do that for.
[11:19.230 --> 11:20.630]  If I'm running a production crop,
[11:20.630 --> 11:22.790]  I'll put between four and six,
[11:22.790 --> 11:24.750]  seven gallon pots under a thousand watt light,
[11:24.750 --> 11:26.470]  depending on the strain.
[11:26.470 --> 11:29.270]  If they get taller and thinner, I'll put six of them.
[11:29.270 --> 11:30.670]  If they're like bushier plants,
[11:30.670 --> 11:34.150]  like I'll say the Grateful Dog, I'll only put four.
[11:34.150 --> 11:36.390]  Lemon Jeffrey, I'll put six.
[11:36.390 --> 11:38.830]  Just kind of, because the Lemon Jeffrey gets taller
[11:38.830 --> 11:41.190]  than it does wide, so I'll put six of them under there
[11:41.190 --> 11:42.830]  and pull a pretty nice harvest,
[11:42.830 --> 11:44.910]  about a pound and a half from six Lemon Jeffrey plants
[11:44.950 --> 11:47.790]  and seven gallon pots under a thousand watt light.
[11:48.870 --> 11:53.870]  Of course I can get that pound and a half from four of them,
[11:53.990 --> 11:56.070]  but I have to let it veg just a little bit longer,
[11:56.070 --> 11:58.070]  maybe like two weeks more.
[11:58.070 --> 11:59.230]  And then the, but that's just,
[11:59.230 --> 12:02.230]  that's the difference in the pot size and the veg times
[12:02.230 --> 12:03.310]  and how many pots.
[12:03.310 --> 12:05.670]  That's where you start doing that kind of math.
[12:05.670 --> 12:08.390]  But both of these methods will harvest me about a pound,
[12:08.390 --> 12:10.190]  pound and a half if done correctly.
[12:10.190 --> 12:12.470]  The smaller plants take less time to veg,
[12:12.470 --> 12:14.750]  but I like the production from a seven gallon pot.
[12:15.590 --> 12:16.430]  So if they're a little bit bigger,
[12:16.430 --> 12:17.350]  they seem like they're able to grow more.
[12:17.350 --> 12:18.430]  When they have a bigger root ball,
[12:18.430 --> 12:20.630]  they just seem to take off.
[12:20.630 --> 12:22.510]  They grow larger in flower.
[12:22.510 --> 12:24.830]  They seem like they keep growing a little bit taller.
[12:24.830 --> 12:27.910]  They don't cut off as early in their growth phase in flower.
[12:27.910 --> 12:29.710]  So we're also limited by plant count.
[12:29.710 --> 12:32.430]  So a fewer larger pots is better for the medical growers.
[12:32.430 --> 12:34.950]  If you have a small grow space, of course use smaller pots.
[12:34.950 --> 12:37.750]  If you have room for larger pots, go for larger pots.
[12:37.750 --> 12:39.430]  You can experiment and see what and why
[12:39.430 --> 12:41.150]  and how it all works best for your needs
[12:41.150 --> 12:44.110]  and your environment, how much herb you need,
[12:44.110 --> 12:46.950]  how often you need it, what strains you're gonna grow.
[12:46.950 --> 12:48.110]  Those are all things that are gonna
[12:48.110 --> 12:49.790]  kind of decide this stuff for you.
[12:51.310 --> 12:53.190]  Excuse my dab cough.
[12:53.190 --> 12:55.230]  I like to take a lot of dabs when I record a podcast.
[12:55.230 --> 12:56.670]  Adam was here watching me record and he's like,
[12:56.670 --> 12:59.070]  dude, how do you even record with that many dabs going on?
[12:59.070 --> 13:00.150]  I recorded some stuff with him.
[13:00.150 --> 13:01.350]  I'll make another episode out of that.
[13:01.350 --> 13:03.010]  We got a little out of hand and just started rambling.
[13:03.010 --> 13:05.030]  So anyway, I'm doing that again.
[13:05.030 --> 13:05.870]  Here we go.
[13:05.870 --> 13:08.750]  Once you've chosen your pot size, it's time for a good soil.
[13:08.750 --> 13:11.750]  I like a nice fluffy soil with lots of perlite in it.
[13:11.750 --> 13:12.830]  I had plenty of amendments.
[13:12.830 --> 13:14.590]  So I buy a fairly inert soil.
[13:15.590 --> 13:17.510]  If you have access to a good grow supply store,
[13:17.510 --> 13:18.750]  then I recommend starting with something
[13:18.750 --> 13:20.750]  like Roots Organic, Sunshine Mix number four,
[13:20.750 --> 13:21.790]  something similar to that.
[13:21.790 --> 13:23.710]  These are all great starters.
[13:23.710 --> 13:25.870]  I use a recycled and amended soil mix
[13:25.870 --> 13:27.110]  that can get a little complex
[13:27.110 --> 13:28.690]  and it can make it hard to diagnose problems
[13:28.690 --> 13:29.530]  if one comes up.
[13:29.530 --> 13:31.850]  So I recommend learning what the basic soil
[13:31.850 --> 13:33.230]  and organic bottled nutrients,
[13:33.230 --> 13:35.910]  unless you have experience with farming, horticulture,
[13:35.910 --> 13:39.310]  composting, or some kind of soil or plant education.
[13:39.310 --> 13:40.910]  Once you understand the basics of the plants,
[13:40.910 --> 13:42.270]  we can make a super soil mix
[13:42.670 --> 13:43.830]  and work on eliminating the bottle feeds.
[13:43.830 --> 13:45.550]  But for now, let's keep it simple
[13:45.550 --> 13:47.430]  and develop a good understanding of these plants.
[13:47.430 --> 13:49.510]  That's where we want to start.
[13:49.510 --> 13:50.990]  So you've got some soil, you've got some pots.
[13:50.990 --> 13:52.670]  Now we've got some small plants that are in cups.
[13:52.670 --> 13:55.350]  Let's get those babies into the big girl pots.
[13:55.350 --> 13:58.970]  And then we'll talk about feeding for the vegetation phase.
[13:59.870 --> 14:01.190]  So having the little babies in cups
[14:01.190 --> 14:02.030]  is really going to help out
[14:02.030 --> 14:03.750]  and make it easy to transplant.
[14:03.750 --> 14:05.110]  I fill my pots with soil
[14:05.110 --> 14:06.510]  and I pack it in there slightly tight.
[14:06.510 --> 14:07.770]  I just press it down with my hands
[14:07.770 --> 14:08.870]  and I don't pack it so tightly
[14:08.870 --> 14:10.350]  that the roots can't dig through,
[14:10.350 --> 14:12.070]  but I do want to pack it tightly enough
[14:12.910 --> 14:13.830]  to where the plant's going to have plenty of support
[14:13.830 --> 14:16.190]  once I bury that root ball in there.
[14:16.190 --> 14:17.390]  If the soil is packed too lightly,
[14:17.390 --> 14:19.590]  you'll know because as soon as you water,
[14:19.590 --> 14:21.070]  the water is just going to run right through the dirt
[14:21.070 --> 14:22.150]  and the soil is going to cave in
[14:22.150 --> 14:23.430]  and then you'll have to refill in there.
[14:23.430 --> 14:26.350]  But anyway, fill your pots about two inches from the top
[14:26.350 --> 14:27.630]  or more for bigger pots.
[14:27.630 --> 14:29.790]  We want to save some space for watering.
[14:29.790 --> 14:32.470]  A seven gallon pot will take a gallon of water or more
[14:32.470 --> 14:33.870]  and that needs some space in your pot.
[14:33.870 --> 14:35.230]  And a three gallon pot,
[14:35.230 --> 14:37.070]  you'll easily take half a gallon up to a gallon.
[14:37.070 --> 14:38.910]  So save yourself some space.
[14:38.910 --> 14:40.110]  So I get the pot mostly full
[14:40.110 --> 14:42.710]  and I dig out about a large handful of soil
[14:42.710 --> 14:44.350]  out of the center of the pot.
[14:44.350 --> 14:45.870]  I set the clone in the cup.
[14:45.870 --> 14:48.490]  It's still in the plastic cup right now for a minute.
[14:48.490 --> 14:51.510]  I set that cup in the spot where the clone is going to go
[14:51.510 --> 14:53.550]  and I backfill the dirt around the cup.
[14:53.550 --> 14:55.750]  This makes a perfect little spot for the clone to fit
[14:55.750 --> 14:57.370]  without disturbing the roots.
[14:58.310 --> 14:59.390]  But I don't leave the cup.
[14:59.390 --> 15:00.430]  Okay, I want to stress that.
[15:00.430 --> 15:02.230]  I do not leave the cup on the clone.
[15:02.230 --> 15:05.350]  Only for that one second while I was making an indention.
[15:05.350 --> 15:06.270]  I don't leave the cup.
[15:06.270 --> 15:09.590]  I only use it to make a little space for the clone.
[15:09.630 --> 15:11.790]  Once I've got the perfect little space in there,
[15:11.790 --> 15:13.230]  made for my clone,
[15:13.230 --> 15:15.590]  I pull that cup out with the clone in it
[15:15.590 --> 15:17.550]  and then I hold the cup upside down
[15:18.390 --> 15:19.710]  with my hand on top of the cup
[15:19.710 --> 15:21.150]  with the clone coming out
[15:21.150 --> 15:23.070]  between my middle and ring finger
[15:23.070 --> 15:24.730]  and I flip the cup upside down.
[15:26.110 --> 15:26.950]  Excuse me, sorry.
[15:26.950 --> 15:29.170]  I flip it upside down and give it a little squeeze.
[15:29.170 --> 15:30.990]  And then usually you could just squeeze it and shake it
[15:30.990 --> 15:33.830]  until the clone slides out of the cup.
[15:33.830 --> 15:37.150]  And then try not to disturb the roots
[15:37.150 --> 15:38.870]  and that soil ball that come right out of there.
[15:39.030 --> 15:40.550]  Just shake it and it'll come out
[15:40.550 --> 15:43.110]  and set that little soil ball perfectly
[15:43.110 --> 15:45.090]  into that perfect little spot that we just made.
[15:45.090 --> 15:46.630]  It should be the same shape as the cup
[15:46.630 --> 15:48.070]  since you just make it.
[15:48.070 --> 15:50.710]  So just set it right down in there.
[15:50.710 --> 15:53.990]  When the cup comes off, there'll be dirt falling out.
[15:53.990 --> 15:55.970]  It'll seem chaotic and messy, but just stay calm.
[15:55.970 --> 15:56.970]  You could drop dirt and shit.
[15:56.970 --> 15:58.350]  Just don't drop the plant.
[15:58.350 --> 16:00.830]  Just focus on getting that tiny little root ball
[16:00.830 --> 16:02.030]  into that hole that we just made
[16:02.030 --> 16:04.070]  and everything should be just fine.
[16:04.070 --> 16:05.670]  So now you've taken your cup,
[16:05.670 --> 16:06.950]  you flipped it upside down,
[16:06.950 --> 16:08.210]  that little baby plant's falling out.
[16:08.570 --> 16:09.490]  You got a handful of dirt.
[16:09.490 --> 16:11.010]  You're holding your new fucking life
[16:11.010 --> 16:12.250]  right there in your hand.
[16:12.250 --> 16:13.130]  You set it in that,
[16:13.130 --> 16:14.450]  like remember that little toy you used to have
[16:14.450 --> 16:15.290]  when you were a kid?
[16:15.290 --> 16:16.730]  You had to put the little peg into the whole thing.
[16:16.730 --> 16:19.210]  So what you wanna do, boom, just set it right in there.
[16:19.210 --> 16:21.130]  And now you gotta get some dirt
[16:21.130 --> 16:22.490]  and put it over the top of that.
[16:22.490 --> 16:24.850]  I just get it like a small handful of soil
[16:24.850 --> 16:26.530]  and I drop it over the top of the whole plant,
[16:26.530 --> 16:28.670]  like right where, not the whole plant, but all the soil,
[16:28.670 --> 16:31.290]  right where I just put the new freshly planted plant
[16:31.290 --> 16:33.830]  and all around the rest to kind of level it out
[16:33.830 --> 16:36.810]  so that you just kind of camouflage where the spot was
[16:36.810 --> 16:38.290]  and you kinda just wanna blend it in.
[16:38.290 --> 16:40.130]  You want all that to become one spot.
[16:41.130 --> 16:42.450]  Now I press it down just tightly enough
[16:42.450 --> 16:43.970]  to hold the plant upright
[16:43.970 --> 16:47.450]  and carefully label your newly potted plant.
[16:47.450 --> 16:48.290]  Label it.
[16:48.290 --> 16:50.650]  It sucks having a plant that's not labeled.
[16:50.650 --> 16:52.850]  If the cup was well labeled,
[16:52.850 --> 16:54.250]  also leave that cup in there.
[16:54.250 --> 16:55.730]  So that way if your label comes off,
[16:55.730 --> 16:56.870]  the cup is still in there.
[16:56.870 --> 16:57.890]  Sometimes that helps.
[16:57.890 --> 16:59.210]  Sometimes I just use the cup,
[16:59.210 --> 17:00.730]  but once in a while I knock the cup out
[17:00.730 --> 17:01.650]  and they get confused.
[17:01.650 --> 17:02.890]  So that sucks.
[17:02.890 --> 17:04.170]  So once I've got that potted,
[17:04.170 --> 17:05.050]  I set it under the light
[17:05.050 --> 17:07.570]  and I keep working until all of my new babies are in pots.
[17:07.570 --> 17:10.010]  Once everything is potted is when I'll feed them
[17:10.010 --> 17:13.090]  and make sure to get the pots thoroughly wet.
[17:13.090 --> 17:15.010]  So you've got a crop of freshly transplanted,
[17:15.010 --> 17:17.170]  planted babies under the lights.
[17:17.170 --> 17:19.070]  And now that's pretty much the beginning
[17:19.070 --> 17:20.730]  of the vegetative growth phase.
[17:20.730 --> 17:22.210]  It's time to mix up some nutrients
[17:22.210 --> 17:26.750]  and feed them their first full veg nutrients.
[17:26.750 --> 17:27.670]  I'm a soil grower,
[17:27.670 --> 17:29.930]  so I pretty much focus on a dirt garden.
[17:29.930 --> 17:31.410]  If you're running a hydro garden,
[17:31.410 --> 17:34.070]  we're gonna have to get a hydro guy
[17:34.070 --> 17:35.350]  on the show here in the future
[17:35.350 --> 17:38.190]  and have him teach you guys some stuff.
[17:38.190 --> 17:40.230]  Let's feed our new babies.
[17:40.230 --> 17:41.110]  If you're a new grower,
[17:41.110 --> 17:44.470]  I recommend mixing your nutrients in a five gallon bucket.
[17:44.470 --> 17:46.830]  Use an accurate measuring device for your nutrients.
[17:46.830 --> 17:49.390]  I use the shot glass that has milliliters
[17:49.390 --> 17:51.990]  and stuff marked on it for small applications.
[17:51.990 --> 17:53.990]  For larger stuff, there's a pint glass
[17:53.990 --> 17:56.550]  that is marked with milliliters and a few other measurements.
[17:56.550 --> 17:58.670]  You can find those at your local hydro shop.
[17:58.670 --> 17:59.770]  I found a half gallon pitcher
[17:59.770 --> 18:02.250]  that fits perfectly into my five gallon bucket.
[18:02.250 --> 18:06.490]  I've learned to mix my nutrients into that pitcher
[18:06.490 --> 18:08.230]  and add that to the bucket
[18:08.230 --> 18:09.730]  instead of mixing my nutrients
[18:09.730 --> 18:12.290]  directly into a five gallon bucket.
[18:12.290 --> 18:14.530]  You don't wanna pour out five gallons of water
[18:14.530 --> 18:16.490]  when you mess up mixing your nutrient feed.
[18:16.490 --> 18:18.770]  That's a lot of water to pour down the drain.
[18:18.770 --> 18:21.690]  So fill your pitcher three quarters of the way with water.
[18:21.690 --> 18:24.530]  Add your nutrients of choice to the pitcher.
[18:24.530 --> 18:26.090]  I would use a good base nutrient,
[18:26.090 --> 18:28.550]  a good root inoculant, and some good enzymes.
[18:28.550 --> 18:30.850]  Specifically, I would use 50 milliliters
[18:30.850 --> 18:35.130]  of Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Veg Soil Formula as my base.
[18:35.130 --> 18:38.130]  I would use OGT or Great White Shark as my mycos,
[18:38.130 --> 18:39.290]  which is your inoculant,
[18:39.290 --> 18:43.170]  and I would use 15 milliliters of Hydrazine as my enzymes.
[18:44.290 --> 18:46.690]  So in my garden, I would add a little bit of liquid karma
[18:46.690 --> 18:49.610]  and a few other supplements, but they're not required.
[18:49.610 --> 18:51.850]  I add sweet to feed my beneficials.
[18:51.850 --> 18:55.670]  I add vitamino for extra vitamins and amino acids,
[18:55.670 --> 18:57.290]  and vitamin B also.
[18:57.290 --> 18:59.370]  And what else do I add in there?
[18:59.370 --> 19:00.530]  It seems like I added something else.
[19:01.290 --> 19:03.570]  But if you're not looking to spend the extra bucks,
[19:03.570 --> 19:07.090]  those aren't required, but I like to spoil my plants.
[19:07.090 --> 19:09.370]  After about a week, or during the next week,
[19:09.370 --> 19:11.690]  I'll feed CalMag and potassium silicates.
[19:11.690 --> 19:16.050]  And then I run most of the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro line
[19:16.050 --> 19:17.610]  when I run bottled nutrients.
[19:17.610 --> 19:19.490]  Botanicare is not a sponsor,
[19:19.490 --> 19:22.330]  but I've been most satisfied with Botanicare
[19:22.330 --> 19:24.730]  and Organicare more than any other bottle feed.
[19:24.730 --> 19:26.750]  That's just my opinion.
[19:26.750 --> 19:28.130]  I ran advanced nutrients.
[19:28.130 --> 19:30.130]  I've ran the Auroracil synthetics,
[19:30.690 --> 19:32.650]  which produced some super tasty products.
[19:32.650 --> 19:37.430]  I ran Psycho, which was probably not my favorite.
[19:38.570 --> 19:39.610]  Yeah, I've ran a bunch of them.
[19:39.610 --> 19:42.530]  I've ran the Fox Farms basic stuff.
[19:42.530 --> 19:43.570]  I've done a lot of feeds.
[19:43.570 --> 19:45.850]  I've done so many, I can't even remember them all.
[19:45.850 --> 19:47.570]  Anyway, you can find a pretty good
[19:47.570 --> 19:50.310]  pre-made Botanicare feed chart on their website.
[19:50.310 --> 19:52.210]  I'll try to remember to post some of my notes
[19:52.210 --> 19:54.850]  on the feeding programs for that.
[19:54.850 --> 19:56.410]  Somebody tweet me and remind me.
[19:56.410 --> 19:57.410]  I grow culture.
[19:57.410 --> 19:58.710]  I've got this paper here in front of me,
[19:58.710 --> 20:01.150]  so hopefully that'll remind me.
[20:01.150 --> 20:02.510]  Let's get back on focus a little bit
[20:02.510 --> 20:04.710]  and talk about mixing stuff up.
[20:06.050 --> 20:09.430]  Mix up your bottled feeds in a small container of water,
[20:09.430 --> 20:11.670]  but don't ever mix your nutrients together
[20:11.670 --> 20:13.150]  without plenty of water.
[20:13.150 --> 20:16.390]  Don't pour a shot glass, the measuring device.
[20:16.390 --> 20:18.410]  Don't pour the veg stuff,
[20:18.410 --> 20:20.670]  and then don't pour enzymes into the same shot glass
[20:20.670 --> 20:21.790]  at the same time.
[20:21.790 --> 20:23.470]  Mix those to water.
[20:23.470 --> 20:25.470]  The bottled stuff is sold in separate bottles
[20:25.470 --> 20:27.670]  to prevent bonding of specific elements,
[20:27.670 --> 20:28.870]  so always mix into water.
[20:28.870 --> 20:30.510]  Once your pitcher is mixed,
[20:30.510 --> 20:32.510]  put that into the five-gallon bucket
[20:32.510 --> 20:34.510]  and fill it up the rest of the way.
[20:34.510 --> 20:35.470]  Once the bucket's full,
[20:35.470 --> 20:38.190]  you need to adjust the pH of your feed solution.
[20:38.190 --> 20:41.470]  Adjust your pH to 6.5 using pH down.
[20:41.470 --> 20:44.230]  It's unlikely that your pH is too low.
[20:44.230 --> 20:46.570]  And make sure you calibrate your pH meters frequently.
[20:46.570 --> 20:47.950]  That's always a good idea.
[20:47.950 --> 20:49.870]  So you've got a bucket full of nutrient solution
[20:49.870 --> 20:52.430]  that has been pH adjusted to 6.5.
[20:52.430 --> 20:55.190]  We've got our freshly transplanted babies under a light.
[20:55.190 --> 20:56.070]  The next thing we've got to do
[20:56.070 --> 20:57.830]  is pour the feed into the plants.
[20:57.830 --> 21:02.510]  So, oh, I hope you've got some type of saucer
[21:02.510 --> 21:04.870]  or something under to catch the runoff on your plants also.
[21:04.870 --> 21:07.790]  Like, sit your plants in a saucer or a tray.
[21:07.790 --> 21:09.710]  If you don't have something like that,
[21:09.710 --> 21:11.910]  sometimes I use a, I've got a Rubbermaid tray
[21:11.910 --> 21:14.870]  that'll fit three three-gallon pots in there perfectly,
[21:14.870 --> 21:16.350]  so I can just pour water into the plants
[21:16.350 --> 21:18.670]  and then it'll drain right into there.
[21:18.670 --> 21:20.910]  If not, you're gonna end up with water on the floor.
[21:20.910 --> 21:22.270]  So you need something to catch the runoff
[21:22.270 --> 21:23.510]  that comes out of your plants.
[21:23.510 --> 21:25.350]  So I kind of use the pitcher that I'm using
[21:25.350 --> 21:27.550]  to stir up the solution before I go right to the plants
[21:27.550 --> 21:28.990]  and try to mix up the water a little bit
[21:28.990 --> 21:30.430]  to stir up the stuff.
[21:30.430 --> 21:32.990]  It's always a good idea to stir everything thoroughly.
[21:32.990 --> 21:34.670]  Sometimes if I'm using a big batch,
[21:34.670 --> 21:37.870]  sometimes I mix my nutrients into a much larger batch.
[21:37.870 --> 21:39.990]  I throw an air stone in there to pump it up a little bit
[21:39.990 --> 21:41.510]  to aerate it, and then while it's doing that,
[21:41.510 --> 21:43.590]  I also use a big stick, like the kind that you'd use
[21:43.590 --> 21:44.590]  to support your plants.
[21:44.590 --> 21:46.190]  I use that to stir the water up.
[21:47.070 --> 21:48.150]  Just seems to be effective.
[21:48.150 --> 21:49.390]  I like stirring it, it's a good idea.
[21:49.390 --> 21:51.510]  So mix it up a little bit,
[21:51.510 --> 21:53.790]  then simply pour about a third of a gallon of water
[21:53.830 --> 21:55.750]  of the feed into each plant.
[21:55.750 --> 21:58.830]  If you're using larger pots, you're gonna need more.
[21:58.830 --> 22:02.110]  If the soil settles, then you need to add more water.
[22:02.110 --> 22:04.670]  You'll notice pretty quickly if it crumbles down in.
[22:04.670 --> 22:06.230]  Once we add the water, all the airspace
[22:06.230 --> 22:07.550]  is gonna get pushed out.
[22:07.550 --> 22:09.270]  It's gonna, yeah, the dirt's gonna move around.
[22:09.270 --> 22:10.590]  You may have to adjust some of your plants
[22:10.590 --> 22:12.030]  and some of the soil.
[22:12.030 --> 22:14.030]  So water everything and refill any pots
[22:14.030 --> 22:15.270]  that you need to fill with soil
[22:15.270 --> 22:17.110]  and get the plants under good lights.
[22:17.110 --> 22:18.630]  T5 lights are good for veg,
[22:18.630 --> 22:20.710]  if you have enough of them close to the plants.
[22:20.710 --> 22:23.470]  Metal halides are also ideal for veg growth.
[22:24.150 --> 22:25.110]  We wanna focus on getting those pots
[22:25.110 --> 22:26.950]  full of roots right now.
[22:26.950 --> 22:28.910]  So the blue spectrum is kinda what we want.
[22:28.910 --> 22:30.990]  LEDs seem to be really good for veg plants,
[22:30.990 --> 22:33.510]  but I personally don't have any experience with the LEDs,
[22:33.510 --> 22:35.710]  but I have seen some great photographs
[22:35.710 --> 22:36.990]  coming from an LED garden.
[22:36.990 --> 22:38.070]  Shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[22:38.070 --> 22:39.590]  She's growing some bounty killer right now,
[22:39.590 --> 22:41.390]  and it looks amazing.
[22:42.270 --> 22:46.590]  So try to keep your veg area around 72 to 77 degrees.
[22:46.590 --> 22:49.910]  If you're using CO2, you can let it get a little bit warmer,
[22:49.910 --> 22:52.510]  maybe low 80s during the light period.
[22:52.510 --> 22:53.710]  During your dark cycle,
[22:53.710 --> 22:56.270]  try to keep them about the same temp or no more,
[22:56.270 --> 22:58.390]  no more than 10 degrees cooler
[22:58.390 --> 23:00.470]  than your daytime temperatures.
[23:00.470 --> 23:04.870]  Try to keep your humidity around 40 to 55%, if possible.
[23:04.870 --> 23:06.910]  In Colorado, it gets hard to keep the rooms humid,
[23:06.910 --> 23:08.830]  so they get dry here.
[23:08.830 --> 23:11.110]  Honestly, you'd rather have it too dry than too humid,
[23:11.110 --> 23:12.710]  if you have the option.
[23:12.710 --> 23:14.110]  If you can't get it right where you want it,
[23:14.110 --> 23:15.590]  if your blowers are messed up
[23:15.590 --> 23:16.950]  and not the way you need them to be,
[23:16.950 --> 23:18.070]  if you can't correct it,
[23:18.070 --> 23:19.470]  I understand you're growing in a house,
[23:19.470 --> 23:20.430]  it's not gonna be perfect.
[23:20.470 --> 23:22.590]  You'd rather have it too dry than too moist,
[23:22.590 --> 23:24.430]  if you've got the option.
[23:24.430 --> 23:26.990]  So also remember to keep your air fresh.
[23:26.990 --> 23:29.590]  You don't want stale, stuffy air in your grow rooms.
[23:29.590 --> 23:31.190]  Your plants need plenty of CO2,
[23:31.190 --> 23:34.270]  and they deplete the CO2 in a room very quickly.
[23:34.270 --> 23:37.190]  Having stale air in a grow room can lead to powdery mildew,
[23:37.190 --> 23:41.230]  and it slows down the growth of your plants quite quickly.
[23:41.230 --> 23:43.470]  So I keep my vegging plants under 24 hours of light.
[23:43.470 --> 23:46.550]  I think they grow more quickly under 24 hours of light
[23:46.550 --> 23:49.350]  than they do with a dark cycle during veg.
[23:49.350 --> 23:52.110]  Most books will tell you to run a 16 hour day period
[23:52.110 --> 23:53.970]  and an eight hour dark period.
[23:53.970 --> 23:56.030]  I think it's great because it's how nature works,
[23:56.030 --> 23:57.530]  and you can't argue with that.
[23:58.510 --> 23:59.670]  I've experimented with both.
[23:59.670 --> 24:01.230]  Sometimes if I'm running a seed crop,
[24:01.230 --> 24:03.350]  I will run a 16 hour light cycle,
[24:03.350 --> 24:06.130]  and then go to a 12, 12 cycle.
[24:06.130 --> 24:09.910]  Sometimes I will run an 11, 13 cycle, which is odd,
[24:09.910 --> 24:11.310]  but we'll talk about that later on.
[24:11.310 --> 24:12.750]  I learned that from DJ Short.
[24:13.950 --> 24:16.830]  So that 16, eight light cycle's great.
[24:16.830 --> 24:17.970]  Like I said, it's how nature works.
[24:17.970 --> 24:19.370]  It also lets your equipment cool down
[24:19.370 --> 24:20.650]  and take a little bit of a break,
[24:20.650 --> 24:22.890]  and it lets your electricity bill chill out for a second,
[24:22.890 --> 24:24.090]  lets your meter quit spinning.
[24:24.090 --> 24:25.690]  So as long as your vegging plants
[24:25.690 --> 24:27.610]  are under 16 hours of light every day,
[24:27.610 --> 24:28.450]  they should be happy.
[24:28.450 --> 24:29.850]  You can experiment with it.
[24:30.890 --> 24:33.210]  I'll do another show with more info on light cycles
[24:33.210 --> 24:34.890]  and photo period later on.
[24:35.850 --> 24:37.010]  One thing I've really noticed
[24:37.010 --> 24:40.210]  is that when I flip my plants to 12, 12 to flower
[24:40.210 --> 24:42.430]  from this 24 hour light cycle,
[24:42.430 --> 24:45.090]  they show flower faster than the plants
[24:45.090 --> 24:47.130]  that had a dark cycle during veg.
[24:48.370 --> 24:49.530]  And that's just one thing I've noticed.
[24:49.530 --> 24:51.370]  So if you're really looking for a production crop,
[24:51.370 --> 24:53.030]  that's something to keep in mind.
[24:53.030 --> 24:54.090]  Since I just remembered that
[24:54.090 --> 24:55.650]  that's kind of what inspired that for me,
[24:55.650 --> 24:57.250]  I think I might switch back.
[24:57.250 --> 24:59.650]  And I also like to keep my mother plants under 12, 12
[24:59.650 --> 25:01.930]  just to keep them from even thinking
[25:01.930 --> 25:03.270]  that they may have the chance to flower.
[25:03.270 --> 25:04.450]  Once they get root bound and stuff,
[25:04.450 --> 25:06.450]  they sometimes, some of your mother plants
[25:06.450 --> 25:08.770]  may try to auto flower on you.
[25:08.770 --> 25:10.810]  So we've got our babies in new pots,
[25:11.930 --> 25:12.770]  and we fed them.
[25:12.770 --> 25:13.730]  They're under good lights.
[25:13.730 --> 25:15.770]  I put a fan lightly blowing over the canopy
[25:15.770 --> 25:17.570]  to keep the air circulating.
[25:18.170 --> 25:20.770]  And if the temps and the humidity are correct in the room,
[25:20.770 --> 25:23.490]  the plants won't need water for three or four days
[25:23.490 --> 25:25.530]  if you watered them enough right now.
[25:25.530 --> 25:27.030]  So this is a good time to start thinking
[25:27.030 --> 25:28.850]  about pest management.
[25:28.850 --> 25:30.030]  If you have neem oil on hand,
[25:30.030 --> 25:32.650]  give each plant a good spray when the lights turn off.
[25:32.650 --> 25:35.050]  You don't wanna spray them when the lights are on.
[25:35.050 --> 25:37.130]  That creates what I call little reflector bubbles
[25:37.130 --> 25:40.530]  from the, you know, the bubbles blind on your plant,
[25:40.530 --> 25:41.690]  the light hits it.
[25:41.690 --> 25:43.290]  Just like a magnifying glass did
[25:43.290 --> 25:45.010]  when you were a little kid and used to cook ants,
[25:45.010 --> 25:46.290]  it'll happen to your plants.
[25:46.290 --> 25:48.810]  The grow light will work as the sun,
[25:48.810 --> 25:51.010]  and the bubble will work like a magnifying glass,
[25:51.010 --> 25:52.970]  and you'll get a little burn mark, a little white spot.
[25:52.970 --> 25:54.450]  So spray when the lights are off.
[25:54.450 --> 25:56.810]  Always try to spray it when the lights are off.
[25:57.690 --> 26:00.110]  Yeah, that's, any book will tell you that.
[26:01.330 --> 26:02.810]  Neem will keep most of your pests away.
[26:02.810 --> 26:04.930]  Once you're in flower, you'll need to rethink the neem
[26:04.930 --> 26:07.930]  because you do not wanna spray neem on your flowering plants.
[26:07.930 --> 26:10.330]  Don't do that, it'll taste terrible.
[26:10.330 --> 26:13.290]  If you make concentrates with neem sprayed plants,
[26:13.290 --> 26:14.130]  oh, excuse me.
[26:14.130 --> 26:16.570]  If you make concentrates with neem sprayed plants,
[26:16.570 --> 26:18.110]  you can definitely taste the neem.
[26:18.110 --> 26:20.810]  So once you're in flower, stop spraying neem.
[26:22.090 --> 26:23.670]  I've got a new product I'm testing out.
[26:23.670 --> 26:26.030]  If it works for me, I'm definitely gonna share it with you.
[26:26.030 --> 26:28.290]  It's all organic.
[26:28.290 --> 26:29.750]  It was recommended to me by somebody
[26:29.750 --> 26:32.190]  in the horticulture industry, not the cannabis industry.
[26:32.190 --> 26:35.530]  So it's used for food crops, so it's completely safe.
[26:35.530 --> 26:37.210]  It didn't smell bad when I used it.
[26:37.210 --> 26:38.450]  I'm kind of testing it out now.
[26:38.450 --> 26:39.910]  I'll let you know what I think.
[26:39.910 --> 26:42.010]  So you're now officially in the veg phase.
[26:42.010 --> 26:43.410]  I feed bottle nutrients.
[26:43.410 --> 26:44.610]  If I'm using bottle nutrients,
[26:44.610 --> 26:46.570]  I only feed them once per week
[26:46.570 --> 26:48.690]  with plain pH water throughout the rest of the week.
[26:48.690 --> 26:50.750]  So I personally feed all my plants on Monday.
[26:50.750 --> 26:53.210]  So if you guys are listening to this on Monday,
[26:53.210 --> 26:55.290]  I'm probably waiting for the lights to come on.
[26:55.290 --> 26:56.890]  The flower room comes on at 10.
[26:58.250 --> 26:59.570]  It'll click on.
[26:59.570 --> 27:02.390]  I will actually have my nutrients mixed up already.
[27:02.390 --> 27:04.650]  I'll start doing that about 9.30.
[27:04.650 --> 27:05.930]  It's Monday, they're gonna get fed.
[27:05.930 --> 27:07.650]  I think these plants are in,
[27:07.650 --> 27:08.730]  they're gonna start week five today.
[27:08.730 --> 27:11.090]  So I'll start mixing up their week five stuff.
[27:11.810 --> 27:14.010]  Get the pH adjusted in there,
[27:14.010 --> 27:15.330]  and then I'll throw some air stones in there
[27:15.330 --> 27:16.690]  and let that stuff just bubble around
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.290]  and let the nutrients mingle for a little while.
[27:18.290 --> 27:19.370]  And then as soon as the lights come on,
[27:19.370 --> 27:21.170]  I'll go in there and feed them.
[27:21.170 --> 27:25.530]  So I'll need the water again, usually by Thursday.
[27:25.530 --> 27:27.090]  Once they get heavier into flower,
[27:27.090 --> 27:28.390]  it may step up to Wednesday.
[27:28.390 --> 27:29.730]  They won't go as long.
[27:29.730 --> 27:32.170]  So think about how tall you can let your plants get.
[27:32.170 --> 27:33.410]  That's something you gotta keep in mind.
[27:33.410 --> 27:36.090]  Think about how tall your plants can get.
[27:36.090 --> 27:37.850]  Think about if you wanna top them
[27:37.850 --> 27:39.210]  or let them grow naturally,
[27:39.210 --> 27:41.130]  because your plants, some sativa plants
[27:41.130 --> 27:43.050]  can double in size during flower.
[27:43.050 --> 27:45.070]  Like if you're growing the bounty killer,
[27:45.070 --> 27:47.050]  that thing is going to double in size
[27:47.050 --> 27:48.210]  during your flower period.
[27:48.210 --> 27:49.630]  So it's time to think about how tall
[27:49.630 --> 27:50.970]  and wide your plants can get
[27:50.970 --> 27:53.090]  before you need to flower them out,
[27:53.090 --> 27:55.570]  because that is going to be the next major phase
[27:55.570 --> 27:56.410]  of your plants.
[27:56.410 --> 27:57.370]  You gotta let them veg.
[27:57.370 --> 27:59.730]  You probably got another month to 45,
[27:59.730 --> 28:01.950]  maybe two months if you wanna go crazy.
[28:01.950 --> 28:04.910]  But I recommend about 30 days veg time from here out.
[28:04.910 --> 28:07.050]  So don't get any bugs.
[28:07.050 --> 28:08.210]  Don't burn them with nutrients.
[28:08.210 --> 28:09.050]  Take good care of them.
[28:09.890 --> 28:11.090]  That's super important.
[28:11.090 --> 28:12.850]  I think that gets us basically started
[28:12.850 --> 28:13.730]  through the veg phase.
[28:13.730 --> 28:16.050]  I plan to go in depth with each of these little topics
[28:16.050 --> 28:16.890]  in the future.
[28:16.890 --> 28:18.210]  We'll make little branches from everything
[28:18.210 --> 28:19.290]  that I've mentioned.
[28:19.290 --> 28:21.170]  I wanna get everybody up to speed with the basics
[28:21.170 --> 28:24.470]  before we go too deeply into specific stuff about growing.
[28:24.470 --> 28:26.610]  I've got tons of information to share with you guys.
[28:26.610 --> 28:29.010]  If you want more details on anything I mentioned,
[28:29.010 --> 28:32.130]  please just ask me because I would love to help you out.
[28:32.130 --> 28:33.250]  I'd love to elaborate.
[28:33.250 --> 28:34.070]  Tweet me.
[28:34.070 --> 28:35.170]  It's at I Grow Culture.
[28:35.170 --> 28:37.290]  Facebook me at I Grow Culture on Facebook
[28:37.290 --> 28:38.610]  or send me an email.
[28:39.130 --> 28:40.370]  It's I Grow Culture at hotmail.com.
[28:40.370 --> 28:42.490]  I feel like I say that all the time.
[28:42.490 --> 28:44.450]  I will answer almost anything you ask.
[28:44.450 --> 28:47.410]  I love to just interact with my social media people.
[28:47.410 --> 28:48.470]  It's fun.
[28:48.470 --> 28:49.930]  So I feel like that was a lot of talking.
[28:49.930 --> 28:53.210]  I'm gonna freshen up my throat here, probably take a dab.
[28:54.170 --> 28:57.610]  I'm gonna be right back and we will see
[28:57.610 --> 28:58.610]  what else we got for this show.
[28:58.610 --> 28:59.430]  Hang tight.
[29:00.610 --> 29:02.230]  All right guys, I'm gonna wrap the show up right there.
[29:02.230 --> 29:04.190]  You tend to listen to more of the show
[29:04.190 --> 29:06.050]  if I put out a 30 minute episode.
[29:06.050 --> 29:07.730]  It gets a better response.
[29:07.770 --> 29:10.810]  So now that the show's over, please go to iTunes,
[29:10.810 --> 29:13.350]  go to the iTunes store, search for I Grow Culture.
[29:13.350 --> 29:14.410]  Find the review section.
[29:14.410 --> 29:15.690]  Give me a five star rating.
[29:15.690 --> 29:17.010]  After that, type in a little comment
[29:17.010 --> 29:18.710]  and let me know what you think of the podcast
[29:18.710 --> 29:20.730]  and I will read your comments on the show.
[29:20.730 --> 29:22.770]  I love the interaction.
[29:22.770 --> 29:24.690]  Don't forget that the show is available
[29:24.690 --> 29:27.370]  on iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am,
[29:27.370 --> 29:29.470]  and also every episode is available
[29:29.470 --> 29:32.270]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[29:32.270 --> 29:34.130]  So if you wanna go back and listen to old episodes
[29:34.130 --> 29:37.130]  that aren't available on iTunes or Stitcher,
[29:37.530 --> 29:41.850]  all you gotta do is go to www.iRegeneticsColorado.com
[29:41.850 --> 29:44.770]  and you can click on the podcast tab right there
[29:44.770 --> 29:47.490]  and every episode should be available.
[29:47.490 --> 29:49.130]  Big shout out to Wyndon Juspence.
[29:49.130 --> 29:50.490]  Big thanks to Adam.
[29:50.490 --> 29:52.730]  Adam came and hung out with me for a little while
[29:52.730 --> 29:55.050]  and watched me record part of the show.
[29:55.050 --> 29:56.810]  Big shout out to everybody that helped me out this week
[29:56.810 --> 29:58.530]  with a few things I needed.
[29:58.530 --> 30:00.530]  It's been a busy week, so thanks for all the help
[30:00.530 --> 30:03.010]  in the iRegenetics family.
[30:03.010 --> 30:06.130]  I'll be back in seven days with a brand new episode for you.
[30:06.130 --> 30:08.390]  Probably have more grow lessons for you.
[30:08.390 --> 30:10.010]  And Jesse is getting married,
[30:10.010 --> 30:13.250]  so he won't be back for a couple weeks to do an episode,
[30:13.250 --> 30:14.370]  but he will be back.
[30:14.370 --> 30:16.450]  So you guys that keep tweeting me and asking me,
[30:16.450 --> 30:17.450]  where's Jesse?
[30:17.450 --> 30:18.430]  He's planning a wedding.
[30:18.430 --> 30:20.470]  We gotta give him some time and some space.
[30:20.470 --> 30:22.210]  He belongs to his wife now.
[30:22.210 --> 30:23.650]  He is not ours anymore.
[30:23.650 --> 30:24.490]  Shout out to Jesse.
[30:24.490 --> 30:26.210]  Congratulations on the wedding.
[30:26.210 --> 30:27.230]  That's not for another week,
[30:27.230 --> 30:29.650]  but it's coming up and we're proud for you.
[30:29.650 --> 30:31.810]  I need to give a huge shout out to DJ Nikiti.
[30:31.810 --> 30:33.490]  The music you heard at the beginning of the show
[30:33.490 --> 30:34.490]  was DJ Nikiti.
[30:34.490 --> 30:36.090]  The song that I'm about to play right here
[30:36.090 --> 30:38.090]  to end of the show will also be DJ Nikiti.
[30:38.090 --> 30:40.570]  So thanks for letting me play your music.
[30:40.570 --> 30:43.250]  Need to give a big shout out to my ninja spence.
[30:43.250 --> 30:44.610]  That was the end of episode number 20.
[30:44.610 --> 30:45.770]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[30:45.770 --> 30:47.290]  It really means a lot to me.
[30:47.290 --> 30:48.650]  Take a fat dab.
[30:48.650 --> 30:50.010]  Give your mom a hug for me.
