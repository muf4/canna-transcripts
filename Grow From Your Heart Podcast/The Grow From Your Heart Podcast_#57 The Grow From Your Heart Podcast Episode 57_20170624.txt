[00:32.090 --> 00:36.090]  a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.090 --> 00:39.930]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining
[00:39.930 --> 00:43.610]  me. As always, I want to send a big, huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band
[00:43.610 --> 00:47.250]  for letting me use their music on the show. Big, huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the whole
[00:47.250 --> 00:51.730]  Mystic Roots crew. How are you guys doing today, man? I'm hanging out by myself. Just
[00:51.730 --> 00:56.330]  me getting down to some reggae music, taking some dabs, dabbing on some chem dog nectar
[00:56.330 --> 01:00.970]  that I picked up at Nugs with Green and Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs. This is some
[01:00.970 --> 01:05.690]  delicious shatter. I really like this. Had me a little Twitter pated all day from this
[01:05.690 --> 01:09.690]  shatter. Digging it. It's just me hanging out. So we're going to turn down the music
[01:09.810 --> 01:14.850]  and we're going to read some news. I've got an iTunes comment to read, but before we get

[03:25.950 --> 03:30.130]  screw you over, if one of our sponsors fucks you over in any way, let me know and I will
[03:30.130 --> 03:33.470]  help solve the problem and I may even drop them as a sponsor because I don't need to
[03:33.470 --> 03:37.710]  advertise somebody that doesn't support the community. That's how strongly I feel about
[03:37.710 --> 03:41.790]  it. Support all of our sponsors. If you're interested in sponsoring the show, send me

[03:46.790 --> 03:50.750]  you need. All right, I'm going to turn down the music here. It's a little loud in my ear.
[03:51.350 --> 03:58.350]  I'm going to turn that down and let's go to iTunes and let's read an iTunes comment. Here it is.
[03:58.350 --> 04:03.790]  This comment is from WhiteTrike. The comment is, this show is great. Keep it up. Well,
[04:03.790 --> 04:06.930]  thanks a lot for the comment, WhiteTrike. I appreciate that. I like hearing that the
[04:06.930 --> 04:11.850]  show is great and I like the encouragement, so I definitely, definitely will keep it up.
[04:11.850 --> 04:14.390]  Thanks for that comment. Thanks to everybody that's left a comment in the past. Let's go
[04:14.390 --> 04:18.470]  to Twitter. I've actually got a couple of Twitter comments I want to read. I feel like
[04:18.470 --> 04:22.750]  I'm doing a Doug Benson stand-up comedy show because Doug Benson just stands there and
[04:22.750 --> 04:26.990]  reads tweets the whole time. That's kind of what I'm doing to you guys. I like supporting
[04:26.990 --> 04:29.910]  the listeners. There wouldn't be a podcast if there weren't listeners. It'd just be me
[04:29.910 --> 04:35.390]  talking into a mic for no reason. I appreciate you guys a lot. Scrolling through, looking
[04:35.390 --> 04:39.870]  for this notification here. Where is it? Mr. Omnio. He says, sitting in the garden in the
[04:39.870 --> 04:43.710]  sun while listening to Ross DeGeff on the Grow From Your Heart podcast, explain worm
[04:43.710 --> 04:48.970]  castings, benefits, and seed genetics. Hashtag good life. Mr. Omnio, dude, thanks for listening
[04:48.970 --> 04:51.990]  to me while you're gardening. That's what I'm hoping for. I hope you guys are in the
[04:51.990 --> 04:56.870]  garden learning stuff while you're playing with the plants. Maybe you're on the drive
[04:56.870 --> 05:01.070]  to or from work. Maybe you're at work. Hopefully, I'm in your ear entertaining you and teaching
[05:01.070 --> 05:08.590]  you something about cannabis. Also, let's see. Adrian Gee, the amazing Adrian. He said,
[05:08.590 --> 05:11.990]  at Grow For... It could be a he or a she. Let me check on your stuff here. I don't want
[05:11.990 --> 05:16.390]  to call you he if you're a female. I'm sorry. Adrian is kind of a unisex name. No, that
[05:16.390 --> 05:22.550]  is a dude in that picture. It's definitely a dude. He, Adrian, says... Now, I got to
[05:22.550 --> 05:26.990]  go back to your comment. Here we go. At Grow From Your Heart podcast, just started listening
[05:26.990 --> 05:31.350]  to your podcast. It's great. Lots of good info. Of course, I replied. I said, thanks
[05:31.350 --> 05:34.870]  for listening on Twitter. Dude, thanks for listening to the show. That's what I'm here
[05:34.870 --> 05:38.230]  for. I'm trying to teach you guys, trying to educate a little bit, trying to move cannabis
[05:38.230 --> 05:43.630]  forward. I think if we talk more positively about this plant, people will be less afraid.
[05:43.630 --> 05:47.310]  All we got to do is open the door to talk about it. Again, big thanks and big shout
[05:47.310 --> 05:52.350]  out to White Trike for the iTunes comment there. If you leave a comment on iTunes or
[05:52.350 --> 05:55.110]  Stitcher, I will read it on the show, you guys. If you don't want to leave a comment
[05:55.110 --> 06:00.550]  on iTunes or Stitcher, send me a tweet. It's at GFYH podcast, or find me on Facebook and
[06:00.550 --> 06:03.990]  I'll respond to you there. If you want to say something anonymously, you can send me
[06:03.990 --> 06:07.870]  a personal or private message and I will keep your name private. You can also email
[06:07.870 --> 06:12.950]  me. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I know that's a lot of contact information,
[06:12.950 --> 06:16.830]  but if you want to be in touch, I'd love to hear from you.
[06:16.830 --> 06:21.910]  I said at the beginning of the show that I had a bunch of news and stuff to talk about.
[06:21.910 --> 06:26.070]  Let's click on some stuff. Here we go. Clicking away. Click, click, click. I'm finding the
[06:26.070 --> 06:31.530]  first news article. The first news article is ... It hits home here because I actually
[06:31.530 --> 06:36.090]  am a medical marijuana caregiver. The way you become a caregiver, all you really have
[06:36.090 --> 06:41.850]  to do is have ... There's a patient. That's what we call the person that smokes the medical
[06:41.850 --> 06:45.810]  marijuana. There's a patient. That person goes to the doctor. They get their medical
[06:45.810 --> 06:51.230]  marijuana recommendation. Then when you send that into the state of Colorado, you can assign
[06:51.230 --> 06:57.150]  a caregiver. That's where my name goes onto that paper. My name and my address and a copy
[06:57.150 --> 07:01.710]  of my ID get sent to the state and I become a caregiver, which means I am now responsible
[07:01.710 --> 07:07.870]  for growing medical cannabis for my friend who signed me up. There is a limit of five
[07:07.870 --> 07:12.610]  people that you're allowed to be a caregiver for. You can have yourself plus five other
[07:12.610 --> 07:18.950]  people and you can grow cannabis for them. That's how it was.
[07:18.950 --> 07:22.070]  Before you were allowed to have six plants per person, but then there are doctors that
[07:22.070 --> 07:29.070]  are willing to write you an extended plant count. If you say, my back hurts a lot or
[07:29.070 --> 07:34.030]  I've got fibromyalgia and I don't smoke cannabis, I actually make oils out of all of this and
[07:34.030 --> 07:37.690]  I need a lot more plants, the doctors will be a little compassionate and they will write
[07:37.690 --> 07:42.350]  you what's called an extended plant count. Sometimes that costs you more money, but in
[07:42.350 --> 07:46.030]  the long run that's worth it because you need your medicine. That just allows you to grow
[07:46.030 --> 07:54.230]  more plants and possess more cannabis. The state has caught on that some people are going
[07:54.230 --> 07:58.230]  to the doctor and there are some doctors in Colorado that it just costs money. If you
[07:58.230 --> 08:03.790]  want the original six plants, it's cheap. You go in there and pay a cheap $45, $50 visit.
[08:03.790 --> 08:10.190]  If you want 12 plants, they double it. If you want 25 plants, they pretty much quadruple
[08:10.190 --> 08:15.190]  your price. If you're wanting 50 plants, you're paying five times what you did before. There
[08:15.190 --> 08:21.590]  are some doctors that will write a 99 plant recommendation for $500 flat. You can grow
[08:21.590 --> 08:27.550]  99 plants in your house for $500 for one year. That's how it was, but now they're making
[08:27.550 --> 08:31.110]  all kinds of rules because they've seen that. What happens is a lot of people sign up for
[08:31.110 --> 08:36.990]  99 plants and if you grow 99 seven gallon pots, hopefully you're pulling a whole bunch
[08:36.990 --> 08:41.430]  of weight and then that's hitting the black market and they're aware of that and they
[08:41.430 --> 08:44.510]  don't want that happening in the state of Colorado anymore. They're really trying to
[08:44.510 --> 08:48.590]  crack down and tax every gram of pot that's produced. I'm going to take a sip here and
[08:48.590 --> 08:55.740]  then I'll read you this news article I've got. I've got some yerba mate here. It's nice
[08:55.740 --> 09:01.740]  and hot. I've got to be careful with that. This news article comes from a website called
[09:01.740 --> 09:06.940]  The Cannabis. Shout out to The Cannabis. I pull a lot of news articles from this site.
[09:06.940 --> 09:10.700]  This was actually published February 26th, so I'm a little bit behind, but this is still
[09:10.700 --> 09:15.940]  relevant. The article was by Joey Bunch of the Denver Post. The headline is, Colorado
[09:16.060 --> 09:21.900]  MMJ Caregiver Bill Clears Senate Committee. The article says, a state Senate committee
[09:21.900 --> 09:25.700]  on Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would require medical marijuana caregivers
[09:25.700 --> 09:30.580]  to register and allow state agencies to share enough information to ensure pot grown for
[09:30.580 --> 09:35.820]  medicine isn't sold illegally. While pot sold for recreational use has been subject to a
[09:35.820 --> 09:39.940]  battery of tests and regulations since it became legal last year, medical marijuana
[09:39.940 --> 09:44.140]  has gone relatively unregulated, requiring only that caregivers be at least 18 years
[09:44.140 --> 09:50.620]  old and have significant responsibility for the care of a licensed medical marijuana user.
[09:50.620 --> 09:55.300]  There's actually a spot on the application that asks what services you provide for your
[09:55.300 --> 10:00.100]  patient. I write spiritual counseling. I write that I drive them to and from their doctor's
[10:00.100 --> 10:06.660]  appointments because a lot of that is true. I prepare meals for some of my patients. They
[10:06.660 --> 10:11.820]  ask for what you do, so you got to fill that in. Actually, they denied one of my caregiver
[10:11.820 --> 10:15.100]  requests. I had to refill out the paper and put better reasoning because they did not
[10:15.100 --> 10:19.940]  like my reasons why I was part of their significant responsibility. So they are paying a little
[10:19.940 --> 10:24.980]  bit of attention. I'll get back to the article. It says the regulatory bill was characterized
[10:24.980 --> 10:30.180]  by the state agency and law enforcement officials as a benefit to caregivers because those registered
[10:30.180 --> 10:35.140]  would not have to face arrest or a cost or a costly legal proceedings if they're registered
[10:35.140 --> 10:40.020]  with the state. The bill is supported by the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce. The
[10:40.020 --> 10:44.300]  medical marijuana supporters testified they were concerned about costs from regulations,
[10:44.300 --> 10:49.900]  patient privacy, and the risks of untested medical marijuana. This bill is really about
[10:49.900 --> 10:53.500]  assessing law enforcement, but it's doing so at the expense of the rights of patients
[10:53.500 --> 11:01.060]  and caregivers, said Colorado marijuana activist Robert Chase, who opposed the legislation.
[11:01.060 --> 11:05.380]  In 2009, when the US Attorney General's Office advised federal agents not to intervene in
[11:05.380 --> 11:10.180]  cases that are compliant with state laws, medical marijuana license have exploded in
[11:10.180 --> 11:17.620]  Colorado. In 2008, there were 4,819 licensed medical marijuana patients in Colorado, said
[11:17.620 --> 11:26.020]  Senator Irene Aguilar. As of last December, there were 115,467 license users, said Aguilar,
[11:26.020 --> 11:30.620]  the bill's Senate sponsor. But to keep federal regulators out of Colorado's pot business,
[11:30.620 --> 11:35.700]  the state must regulate it adequately, she said. The federal expectation is that states
[11:35.700 --> 11:39.940]  that have allowed marijuana to be legal and local governments will be implementing strong
[11:39.940 --> 11:44.860]  and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will protect public safety, public health,
[11:44.860 --> 11:49.580]  and law enforcement interests, she said. While the average age of Colorado medical marijuana
[11:49.580 --> 11:55.060]  user is 42 years old, the number of children has increased in the past two years on indications
[11:55.060 --> 12:00.900]  pot helps children with seizures and other illnesses. In March 2013, Colorado had 35
[12:00.900 --> 12:07.580]  patients younger than 18. By last December, the number of minors had grown to 462, Aguilar said.
[12:07.580 --> 12:13.900]  Sierra Riddle of Colorado Springs said she moved from Utah in 2013 because her son has cancer and
[12:13.900 --> 12:18.740]  needs medical marijuana. Big shout out to Team Landon. What's up? I didn't even know Sierra was
[12:18.740 --> 12:22.980]  going to be mentioned in this article. Those are people that we support in Colorado Springs. So,
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.620]  support Team Landon and Sierra Riddle if you can. Big shout out. The amount of children that are
[12:27.620 --> 12:31.380]  increasing on the medical marijuana registry needs to be considered because it's only going
[12:31.380 --> 12:36.060]  to increase more, she said. These rules and laws need to be put in place to protect our children,
[12:36.060 --> 12:41.740]  to protect their plant count, and to protect our rights to grow their plants. Now, this article
[12:41.740 --> 12:47.660]  kind of hits home because I'm a caregiver myself, and the local rules are changing here to where we
[12:47.660 --> 12:52.900]  are being reduced on the number of patients we are allowed to have, which will also reduce
[12:52.900 --> 12:58.100]  the number of plants we are allowed to have, and they have also reduced the amount of space we are
[12:58.100 --> 13:04.020]  allowed to use. So, that means the five people that I'm responsible for providing medical marijuana
[13:04.020 --> 13:09.380]  to, somebody is going to have to find somebody else to grow their medicine for them. And the
[13:09.380 --> 13:16.340]  state doesn't give a shit that I've been responsible for them for the past seven or eight years. It has
[13:16.340 --> 13:22.140]  been my responsibility and my duty to take care of these people. I have established a relationship
[13:22.140 --> 13:26.780]  with them, and I have a significant role in caring for these people, but the state does not care.
[13:26.780 --> 13:32.140]  They need to end that and find a new caregiver to grow their medical cannabis for them. I think
[13:32.140 --> 13:37.340]  that's bullshit because I know these people. I know what strains they like. I have bred strains
[13:37.340 --> 13:41.660]  for my patients. Yes, that's what I do. I have people that smoke medical cannabis,
[13:41.660 --> 13:45.500]  and I will breed strains for them. The night nurse was inspired by my friend Doug.
[13:46.700 --> 13:50.780]  He's an older cat, and his body hurts, and he has a hard time sleeping. When he smoked the
[13:50.780 --> 13:55.580]  Tora Bora, he said, holy shit. And when he smoked the Grateful Dog, he said, holy shit. Those were
[13:55.580 --> 14:01.900]  two of his favorite strains ever. So, I felt like it was my job to make a hybrid of the two and then
[14:01.900 --> 14:07.020]  find the right phenotype that worked for Doug. And when I grew those, he loved it. And now, guess what?
[14:07.660 --> 14:10.860]  Sorry, Doug. I don't get to be your caregiver anymore because the state doesn't give a shit
[14:10.860 --> 14:15.420]  about our bona fide relationship that we've developed over years. Not really, Doug. I'm
[14:15.420 --> 14:19.500]  keeping you, but that's my example. And Team Landon, there are little kids out there with
[14:19.500 --> 14:25.660]  brain tumors, cancers, seizures, lymphoma. Kids have all kinds of bad things that adults have.
[14:25.660 --> 14:31.180]  And now, we need to let these kids have their caregivers have plant counts. This is messed up.
[14:31.180 --> 14:35.820]  This is why I'm fired up because this is what medical... This is what started the cannabis
[14:35.820 --> 14:40.620]  movement in Colorado was medical cannabis and caregivers. Caregivers are what started it.
[14:40.620 --> 14:44.940]  The patients and the caregivers are ground zero. And now, guess who's being screwed right out of
[14:44.940 --> 14:50.300]  this deal? The patients and the caregivers because they want us to be forced to shop at recreational
[14:50.300 --> 14:55.180]  dispensaries where taxes are fucking ridiculous and we cannot afford it. How are we going to
[14:55.180 --> 14:58.700]  medicate ourselves that way? The reason we're medicating ourselves with cannabis is so that we
[14:58.700 --> 15:02.380]  don't have to jump through somebody else's hoops so that we don't have to go stand in line to pay
[15:02.380 --> 15:08.220]  ridiculous prices for medicine. You're fucking us over, guys. Sorry. End of rant. I'm passionate
[15:08.220 --> 15:13.020]  about this. It pisses me off because the patients that started medical cannabis are now the people
[15:13.020 --> 15:17.980]  that nobody... I can't say nobody. The people that most of this industry is looking over right now.
[15:17.980 --> 15:21.980]  We've forgotten them. It's all about the patients. Patients first. Without the patients, there would
[15:21.980 --> 15:25.580]  have been no medical marijuana movement. There would not have been caregivers. There would have
[15:25.580 --> 15:29.740]  not been home grows. And we would not have gotten as far as we've gotten today. We'd be years behind
[15:29.740 --> 15:34.220]  if we did not start this with medical marijuana. All right? So, think about the patients, you guys.
[15:34.780 --> 15:39.420]  I'm going to do the best I can. I'm going to have to register my grows with my city and with my
[15:39.420 --> 15:43.580]  state. They're going to come to my private grow, and they're going to look through my grows and
[15:43.580 --> 15:47.580]  make sure that I'm following all of the laws and that everything is done up to code. I'm going to
[15:47.580 --> 15:51.980]  sign up to do that because I'm well-known around here. And if I don't do it, I know they will come
[15:51.980 --> 15:57.740]  here and they will try to press some kind of legal charges on me. There are papers that I can fill
[15:57.740 --> 16:04.860]  out to have an excuse or an exception to have more patients, but I don't see... I'm going to really
[16:04.860 --> 16:09.100]  have to pull a lot of reasons out of the air because their paperwork, they don't have any
[16:09.100 --> 16:13.260]  compassion. They have check marks. You know what I mean? Does this, this, and this happen? Then no.
[16:13.260 --> 16:16.860]  And it's just like talking to a computer instead of a person with compassion. It sucks.
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.180]  All right. That's enough on that article. Give me a second. All right, guys, I'm back. I took
[16:21.180 --> 16:25.580]  a couple dabs. I calmed down. I'm not so pissed off about that last article anymore. But we have
[16:25.580 --> 16:30.700]  a whole new article coming up, and this could do a lot of things to us. The sub-headline is,
[16:30.700 --> 16:36.220]  another lawsuit has been filed in federal court over Colorado's marijuana legalization amendment.
[16:36.940 --> 16:43.500]  The headline is, new lawsuit, sheriffs from Colorado and elsewhere challenge Amendment 64.
[16:43.500 --> 16:49.500]  What makes the new suit unique is that it is also asking for a federal judge to overturn Amendment
[16:49.500 --> 16:56.860]  64's protections for marijuana use and possession. This article is written by Kirk Mitchell and John
[16:56.860 --> 17:02.780]  Engle of the Denver Post. Let's get right into it. Six Colorado sheriffs sued their own governor
[17:02.780 --> 17:07.420]  in federal court on Thursday, arguing that state laws legalizing marijuana require them to violate
[17:07.420 --> 17:12.460]  federal law. Joining the sheriffs in the lawsuit, the fourth to be filed against Colorado over
[17:12.460 --> 17:17.580]  marijuana legalization, are the sheriffs and prosecutors from Nebraska and Kansas. The suit
[17:17.580 --> 17:22.780]  argues that federal law supremacy means Colorado cannot allow people to possess or use marijuana
[17:22.780 --> 17:27.740]  for recreational purposes, and it cannot license stores to sell it. The law does not challenge
[17:27.740 --> 17:33.100]  Colorado's medical marijuana laws or stores. The suit is about one thing, the rule of the law.
[17:33.100 --> 17:38.940]  Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said in a news release, release, I said released, geez.
[17:38.940 --> 17:43.900]  The Colorado constitution mandates that all elected officials, including sheriffs,
[17:43.900 --> 17:49.980]  swear an oath of office to uphold both the United States as well as the Colorado constitutions.
[17:49.980 --> 17:55.260]  The suit names Governor John Hickenlooper as the lone defendant. Colorado's Attorney General,
[17:55.260 --> 17:59.100]  Cynthia Kaufman, will defend the state against the lawsuit, a spokesman for her said.
[18:00.460 --> 18:05.180]  The lawsuit, excuse me, the lawsuit has the backing of national anti-legalization groups,
[18:05.180 --> 18:10.220]  and its nationwide ambitions were apparent in the choice of where to announce the suit.
[18:10.220 --> 18:14.220]  In a news conference Thursday morning at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.,
[18:14.220 --> 18:19.580]  Smith told reporters that Colorado's passage of Amendment 64 created a constitutional shutdown
[18:19.580 --> 18:24.700]  in the state. The amendment, which voters approved in 2012, made it legal for people over
[18:24.700 --> 18:30.380]  21 in Colorado to possess limited amounts of marijuana and for licensed stores to sell marijuana.
[18:31.020 --> 18:37.580]  Cannabis. We think that what Colorado has done is illegal. We think it's unconstitutional.
[18:37.580 --> 18:43.180]  Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska Sheriff Mark Overman, who is also a plaintiff in the suit,
[18:43.180 --> 18:47.820]  said at the news conference, I believe my fellow plaintiffs believe that this case is going to have
[18:47.820 --> 18:54.380]  national ramifications, and if we win, then we can reverse what looks like a surrender to a pro-marijuana crowd.
[18:55.180 --> 18:59.820]  The lawsuit follows another legal challenge filed in December by Nebraska and Oklahoma,
[18:59.820 --> 19:03.820]  which asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the history-making law.
[19:04.380 --> 19:09.180]  Two lawsuits filed earlier this year by the anti-legalization group Safe Streets Alliance
[19:09.180 --> 19:14.460]  on behalf of several Colorado residents are also pending against the state over Amendment 64.
[19:15.100 --> 19:19.740]  Similar to the previous lawsuits, the new suit seeks to close all of Colorado's recreational
[19:19.740 --> 19:26.300]  marijuana stores, but it also asks a federal judge to overturn Amendment 64's protections
[19:26.300 --> 19:31.180]  for marijuana use and possession. The law enforcement officials' suit claim that local
[19:31.180 --> 19:35.980]  officers are breaking federal law and international treaties when they find marijuana, but they do not
[19:35.980 --> 19:41.900]  seize it. At Thursday's news conference, Yuma County Sheriff Chad Day said Colorado's marijuana laws
[19:42.860 --> 19:48.460]  now prohibit officers from seizing marijuana in certain circumstances, putting officers, he said,
[19:48.460 --> 19:55.980]  in an inevitable position. That's kind of funny. By supporting and upholding one, we're violating
[19:55.980 --> 20:00.700]  the other, he said. I'm excited to, at the very least, get an answer from the courts.
[20:00.700 --> 20:06.380]  Dude, these cops are not robots. They are people, and they know what they're supposed to do.
[20:06.380 --> 20:10.860]  These guys are acting like we've got droids out there acting as police officers, and we're going
[20:10.860 --> 20:16.060]  to flip their switch and make their computers crash. This is ridiculous, dude. Sam Kamen, I'm
[20:16.060 --> 20:20.540]  probably saying that wrong, Sam K., a law professor at the University of Denver, was skeptical of the
[20:20.540 --> 20:26.620]  sheriff's argument. He said no law requires local officers to act as de facto federal drug agents.
[20:27.420 --> 20:32.380]  Of the four lawsuits, this is the one with the least merit, Kamen said. They have targeted not
[20:32.380 --> 20:36.540]  just the marijuana store regulation piece, but they're also essentially saying Colorado can't
[20:36.540 --> 20:42.380]  legalize marijuana. No one has ever gone that far. Colorado plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit
[20:42.380 --> 20:47.980]  include Smith, Day, Elbert County Sheriff Shane Heap, Hinsdale County Sheriff Ronald Bruce,
[20:47.980 --> 20:53.740]  Kiowa County Sheriff Casey Sheridan, and Delta County Sheriff Frederick McKee. Of the six Colorado
[20:53.740 --> 20:58.140]  sheriffs involved in the lawsuit, only Smith is from a county that approved Amendment 64,
[20:58.140 --> 21:05.900]  with 55% of 8,000, or 86,410 voters approving the measure. The measure was approved in 33 of
[21:05.900 --> 21:14.060]  64 Colorado counties by a 55% margin. Also named as plaintiffs are three Nebraska sheriffs, Adam
[21:14.060 --> 21:19.340]  Hayward of Duell County, Mark Overman of Scotts Bluff County, and John Jensen of Cheyenne County.
[21:19.340 --> 21:25.020]  Cheyenne County Attorney Paul Schaub of Nebraska, and Sheriff Charles Mosier of Sherman, Wallace,
[21:25.020 --> 21:29.100]  and Greeley Counties in Kansas also signed the document. Sorry, I kind of stumbled on that last
[21:29.100 --> 21:34.940]  part there, but that was a lot of names, is really all. As in the, excuse me, as in the lawsuit filed
[21:34.940 --> 21:40.460]  in Nebraska and Oklahoma, the law enforcement officials from Nebraska and Kansas are arguing
[21:40.460 --> 21:46.540]  in the new lawsuit that marijuana flowing out of Colorado post legalization has led to more arrests
[21:46.540 --> 21:53.740]  and strain their budgets. I'm going to jump in here and say, so legalize pot in your states.
[21:53.740 --> 21:59.900]  Just legalize weed in Nebraska and Oklahoma and Kansas, and you won't have to worry about arresting
[21:59.900 --> 22:04.060]  more people and straining your budget. You'll be able to sell cannabis like we do here in Colorado,
[22:04.060 --> 22:07.980]  and you'll be able to fill up your cash registers at the stores, and you'll be able to fix your
[22:07.980 --> 22:13.820]  stupid ass roads that you guys have. Think about it. Come on, let's use our fucking brains, people.
[22:13.820 --> 22:17.260]  All right. It's actually taking money out of Sherman County taxpayers' pockets.
[22:17.980 --> 22:23.500]  Burton P. Nolto, the Sheriff in Sherman County, Kansas said at Thursday's news conference,
[22:24.220 --> 22:28.860]  in January, nine out of the 46 people booked into Sherman County jail were suspected of
[22:28.860 --> 22:34.220]  possessing or distributing hallucinogenic drugs, the category under which marijuana is classified
[22:34.220 --> 22:40.140]  in Kansas criminal law, according to an online booking log. Two out of the 15 inmates listed
[22:40.140 --> 22:45.420]  on Thursday as being currently housed in the county jail face charges related to hallucinogenic drugs.
[22:45.980 --> 22:51.340]  So more bullshit. They call cannabis a hallucinogenic drug, which is right in the same
[22:51.340 --> 22:58.540]  category as probably LSD, mushrooms, ecstasy. This is some cannabis, you guys. This is medical
[22:58.540 --> 23:03.580]  marijuana. It's funny to think that over an invisible line, that this is now a hallucinogenic
[23:03.580 --> 23:09.100]  drug, and you cross this invisible line, and now it's recreational cannabis. And then you can cross
[23:09.100 --> 23:15.260]  another line, and it's medical marijuana. This is so good. I love the time and place that we live in.
[23:15.260 --> 23:20.460]  This is so amazing to me. All right. Where was I? Colorado officials have not yet responded to any
[23:20.460 --> 23:24.140]  of the pending lawsuits. Previously, state attorneys have argued that Colorado's more
[23:24.140 --> 23:28.700]  permissive marijuana laws, both for medical and recreational use and sales, do not amount to
[23:28.700 --> 23:33.660]  legalization of marijuana. Instead, they contend that marijuana remains illegal in Colorado, aside
[23:33.660 --> 23:38.620]  from the specific exemptions allowed under the medical and recreational marijuana laws.
[23:39.340 --> 23:44.140]  When Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their lawsuit against Colorado last year, then Colorado Attorney
[23:44.140 --> 23:49.740]  General John Southers said in a statement that it appears the plaintiff's primary grievance stems
[23:49.740 --> 23:54.780]  from a non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the
[23:54.780 --> 24:00.940]  voters of Colorado. Mason Tvert, one of the lead proponents of Amendment 64, said if the lawsuits
[24:00.940 --> 24:05.740]  are successful in striking down the measure, it would lead to a system of marijuana chaos, which
[24:05.740 --> 24:09.100]  I would love to see what happened. I don't want it to happen, but it'd be really neat to see how
[24:09.100 --> 24:14.460]  it's dealt with, because there are dispensaries on every other corner in Denver, every other corner
[24:14.460 --> 24:20.700]  in Colorado Springs. Pueblo West has 12 or 15 dispensaries now in that small community. They are
[24:20.700 --> 24:24.860]  everywhere. It'd be hard to come clean. They'd have to go to California. They'd have to go to
[24:24.860 --> 24:29.980]  every state that's got medical cannabis. They couldn't just come here, because then they'd be
[24:29.980 --> 24:35.500]  singling us out. Says, this is just another case of the arrest and prosecution industry teaming up
[24:35.500 --> 24:39.660]  with marijuana prohibition groups to roll back the progress that has been made in Colorado, he said in
[24:39.660 --> 24:45.420]  a statement Thursday. U.S. Rep. Jared Polis said in a statement that the U.S. Department of Justice
[24:45.420 --> 24:49.820]  and President Obama have made clear that they will not interfere with the states whose citizens voted
[24:49.820 --> 24:55.740]  for recreational marijuana use. This lawsuit is a silly attempt to circumvent the will of Colorado
[24:55.740 --> 25:01.100]  voters, and it is a waste of time, Polis' statement says. Unfortunately, these frivolous lawsuits will
[25:01.100 --> 25:06.940]  likely continue until we pass my bipartisan Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act and finally
[25:06.940 --> 25:12.940]  end the outdated federal prohibition of marijuana. So these states have filed a suit, and they're
[25:12.940 --> 25:19.340]  trying to sue us to shut down our recreational marijuana program because they can't get cannabis
[25:19.340 --> 25:25.340]  to stop coming into their states. I think I said it the first time, stop fucking with us and do what
[25:25.340 --> 25:33.100]  you can to make respectable, responsible cannabis laws in Nebraska and Kansas and Oklahoma, and then
[25:33.100 --> 25:37.740]  the states bordering those will have to follow suit, and then eventually it'll just be a whole
[25:37.740 --> 25:42.220]  green map. Instead of having a red and blue map, we'll start having all green states. This will be
[25:42.220 --> 25:47.420]  great. All right. So here's another article that I keep seeing pop up on social media. I'm finding
[25:47.420 --> 25:52.380]  this article on the cannabis. I get a lot of my articles from there. This was written by Christopher
[25:52.380 --> 25:57.500]  Ingraham from the Washington Post. There's a cute little headline article here, or headline picture
[25:58.300 --> 26:03.180]  of a little bunny rabbit sitting on a digital scale, and the bunny weighs 93.2 grams. It's kind
[26:03.180 --> 26:10.060]  of cute. The headline says, Utah DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state passes medical marijuana
[26:10.060 --> 26:17.820]  bill. I'll say it again. DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state passes medical marijuana bill.
[26:17.820 --> 26:20.140]  I'll let you take that in. Now I'll read the article.
[26:22.140 --> 26:26.060]  Utah is considering a bill that would allow patients with certain debilitating conditions
[26:26.060 --> 26:31.260]  to be treated with edible forms of marijuana. If the bill passes, the state's wildlife may
[26:31.260 --> 26:36.540]  cultivate a taste for the plant, lose their fear of humans, and basically be high all the time.
[26:36.540 --> 26:41.420]  That's according to testimony presented to a Utah state panel last week by an agent of the Drug
[26:41.420 --> 26:47.180]  Enforcement Administration. Ideal in facts, ideal in science, said Special Agent Matt Fairbanks,
[26:47.180 --> 26:52.220]  who's been working in the state for a decade. He is a member of the marijuana eradication team in
[26:52.220 --> 26:58.300]  Utah. Some of his colleagues in Georgia recently achieved notoriety by raiding a retiree's garden
[26:58.300 --> 27:04.380]  and seizing a number of okra plants. Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating backcountry marijuana
[27:04.380 --> 27:09.260]  grows in the Utah mountains, specifically the environmental costs associated with large-scale
[27:09.260 --> 27:14.940]  weed cultivation on public land. Personally, I've seen entire mountainsides subjected to pesticides,
[27:14.940 --> 27:20.460]  harmful chemicals, deforestation, and erosion, he said. The ramifications to the flora,
[27:20.460 --> 27:25.500]  the animal life, the contaminated water are still unknown. Fairbanks said that at some
[27:25.500 --> 27:29.900]  illegal marijuana grow sites, he saw rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana. He
[27:29.900 --> 27:35.820]  continued, one of them refused to leave us as we took all the marijuana around him, but his natural
[27:35.820 --> 27:41.820]  instincts to run were somehow gone. It's true that illegal pot farming can have harmful environmental
[27:41.820 --> 27:46.780]  consequences. Of course, nothing about these consequences is unique to marijuana. If corn
[27:46.860 --> 27:51.820]  were outlawed, the cartels would start growing it on national forests. The per plant environmental
[27:51.820 --> 27:57.420]  toll would be about the same, which is kind of a neat fact. But backcounty marijuana grows are a
[27:57.420 --> 28:02.220]  direct result of marijuana's illegal status. If you're concerned about the environmental impact
[28:02.220 --> 28:07.100]  of the grows, an alternative is to legalize and regulate the plant so that people can grow it on
[28:07.100 --> 28:13.180]  farms and in their gardens rather than on remote mountainsides. Now, regarding stone rabbits,
[28:13.180 --> 28:19.420]  some wild animals apparently do develop a taste for bud. But I don't know that the occasional
[28:19.420 --> 28:23.980]  high rabbit constitutes for grounds for keeping marijuana prohibition in place any more than drunk
[28:23.980 --> 28:29.020]  squirrels are an argument for outlawing alcohol. And let's not even get started on the nationwide
[28:29.020 --> 28:36.220]  epidemic of catnip abuse. There was a time not too long ago when drug warriors terrified a nation
[28:36.220 --> 28:41.100]  with images of the devil's weed and reefer madness. Now it seems that enforcers of marijuana law
[28:41.100 --> 28:46.300]  conjuring up a stoned bunny, not scary enough for the Utah state, it seems. The panel approved
[28:46.300 --> 28:51.660]  the bill and sent it to the full Senate where it will be debated this week. Well, good luck to you,
[28:51.660 --> 28:56.780]  Utah. I hope that this bill passes. I hope that you're allowed to consume an edible form of
[28:56.780 --> 29:03.100]  marijuana. Outlawing cannabis in your state because the rabbits are going to get stoned would be a lot
[29:03.100 --> 29:08.220]  like outlawing roads because dogs and squirrels are going to get ran over. It's kind of a stupid
[29:08.300 --> 29:14.140]  ass argument. Come up with something better. We aren't buying that bullshit anymore because I've
[29:14.140 --> 29:17.500]  got one more news article that I want to read and then we're going to wrap up the show.
[29:19.020 --> 29:25.020]  This one is from the Tok of the Town actually. And this will be the final news article that I am ever
[29:25.020 --> 29:29.980]  going to read from the Tok of the Town and I will tell you why. This article comes from the Tok of
[29:29.980 --> 29:36.620]  the Town and it says, after five years, Tok of the Town says goodbye. Since 2009, Tok of the Town has
[29:36.620 --> 29:40.700]  brought you the biggest marijuana news and the loudest pop views from across the country and
[29:40.700 --> 29:45.020]  around the world. Along the way, we've covered the huge progress many states have made toward
[29:45.020 --> 29:50.700]  legalization and wondered why others are so far behind. This country still has a long way to go,
[29:50.700 --> 29:56.060]  but things are looking up and we have our fingers crossed that 2015 will be another big year for
[29:56.060 --> 30:02.780]  legalization. But the Tok won't be around to see it, at least not in its present form. This is the
[30:03.500 --> 30:07.100]  Tok of the Town's final day of publication. And this was actually written at the end of the year.
[30:07.740 --> 30:11.260]  Don't worry, we're not quitting the movement. We're just returning the focus of our marijuana
[30:11.260 --> 30:15.980]  coverage to our local voice media group papers. You can still read William Breed's weekly pot
[30:15.980 --> 30:21.180]  reviews and ask a stoner column at westward.com where they started and you can continue to follow
[30:21.180 --> 30:25.420]  him on Twitter and on Facebook. And you can keep following Tok on Facebook and Twitter too for the
[30:25.420 --> 30:30.300]  latest marijuana news from all of our papers. Many thanks for reading and supporting us for the past
[30:30.380 --> 30:35.260]  five years. We couldn't have covered the marijuana community without such a strong one reading us.
[30:35.260 --> 30:38.220]  Though the community itself is a strong one. I was thrown off by the way they worded that.
[30:38.860 --> 30:42.380]  And all of our archives will remain online because we wouldn't want you to lose access to
[30:42.380 --> 30:47.180]  our serious reporting on issues of medicine and our lighthearted coverage of stoner movies.
[30:47.180 --> 30:51.500]  Light one up for us, won't you? So this is a little outdated because this was put out at the
[30:51.500 --> 30:55.340]  end of the year, at the start of this year, at the end of last year. The Tok of the Town is not
[30:55.340 --> 31:00.300]  posting any more news. I used to pull a lot of news articles from there, but I will not have them
[31:00.300 --> 31:04.860]  as a resource anymore. So we will miss you Tok of the Town. You were a great resource for my little
[31:04.860 --> 31:10.780]  podcast here. You provided a lot of news articles. I'll do a dab for you later. I'll miss the Tok of
[31:10.780 --> 31:14.860]  the Town. All right, guys, that's enough news for one episode. I'm going to wrap up the show here.
[31:14.860 --> 31:18.060]  It's been about 30 minutes. Let's see how far we've been going. Look at that. I'm getting good
[31:18.060 --> 31:23.340]  at this. I did 31 minutes. I didn't even know how much time we'd done. I'm getting good. All right,
[31:23.340 --> 31:27.900]  let's see. Let's tease some next things. I think the Garden of Weeden will be here on the next
[31:27.900 --> 31:34.540]  episode. I have a phone interview planned with a cat known as Soil Grown on Instagram. Soil Grown
[31:34.540 --> 31:38.940]  is doing something he calls Rosin Tech. If you haven't seen that, we'll talk about that a little
[31:38.940 --> 31:43.980]  bit on the next episode. Garden of Weeden will be here. We're going to talk about canopy management.
[31:43.980 --> 31:47.740]  Big shout out to our friends Greenworks who got us started on this canopy management product,
[31:47.740 --> 31:53.980]  a project. In an upcoming episode, we will have Turpex and Hunt from the Grammy Gatsby to come
[31:53.980 --> 31:57.340]  talk about some things. I'm actually going to Colorado Springs to interview those guys.
[31:58.220 --> 32:02.860]  Also, big shout out to FastBerry. What's up, FastBerry on Instagram? Dude, you asked me a
[32:02.860 --> 32:07.420]  couple of questions today on Instagram, and then you asked me if you were bothering me. No, dude,
[32:07.420 --> 32:11.500]  you're not bothering me at all. I love the questions. I love that you listen to the podcast.
[32:11.500 --> 32:15.900]  I love that you support all of the iRegenetics stuff on Instagram. I love that you listen to
[32:15.900 --> 32:21.180]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. You're never bothering me, dude. Ask me more questions. I will
[32:21.180 --> 32:27.420]  use your questions as material for the show. You'll hear your stuff broadcasted to the whole world. So
[32:27.420 --> 32:30.380]  dude, you're never bothering me. And that goes for everybody. If you send me an email,
[32:30.380 --> 32:34.220]  if you send me a tweet, if you send me a Facebook message, whatever, however you hit me up,
[32:34.860 --> 32:38.060]  you're not bothering me. I will answer you. Sometimes it'll take a minute because you
[32:38.060 --> 32:41.180]  wouldn't believe how many emails and messages I get, but I will respond to you.
[32:41.660 --> 32:48.620]  The best way to contact me would be to join my forum on iRegeneticsColorado.com. Go to the forum,
[32:48.620 --> 32:53.260]  create an account, and go somewhere and ask me a question there. There's an ask the breeder part.
[32:53.260 --> 32:58.060]  Ask a question there, and I will answer you because that's my forum. I'm fully responsible
[32:58.060 --> 33:03.420]  for that. And I check that. I try to get on there every Monday. I can't do it every Monday because
[33:03.420 --> 33:09.420]  life goes certain ways, but ask a question. I'll answer it on the forum. And then if I ever need
[33:09.420 --> 33:14.060]  new testers for new seeds, that's the first place I go to look for testers. I look for your grow
[33:14.060 --> 33:18.060]  photos. I check out your profile on my forum because that shows me that you're interested
[33:18.060 --> 33:21.420]  in my brand and you're kind of loyal. So join the forum. I would appreciate that.
[33:22.140 --> 33:27.180]  Big shout out to my friend Judy. Also, big shout out to Hippie Nurse and a big shout out to Dreadful
[33:27.180 --> 33:31.980]  Jay. Look forward to seeing everybody at the Cannabis Cup. All right, let's wrap up this show.
