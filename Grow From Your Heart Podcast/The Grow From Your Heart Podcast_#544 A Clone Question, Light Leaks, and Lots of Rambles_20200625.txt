[00:42.700 --> 00:47.440]  Dot-com, you know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what i'm smoking today
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.800]  I've been taking little tiny dabs of purple starburst live batter from green dot labs
[00:53.280 --> 00:56.720]  This is a blend of purple punch and skittles starburst
[00:56.860 --> 01:01.920]  Og the flavor on the package is described as sponge sugar grape and shampoo
[01:02.160 --> 01:06.080]  We have talked about this concentrate on the show before I really love that sweet
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.800]  Uh sugary shampoo flavor it kind of tastes like cotton candy shampoo
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.240]  And I really like it show the camera there a little bit if you're watching on youtube
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.760]  You can see what the batter looks like that started off as a four gram jar. I have made a nice dent in the jar
[01:20.160 --> 01:27.520]  Uh, really quality concentrates. I really love the buzz and I really love the flavor so big shout out to our friends at green dot labs
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.200]  I'm sure some of you noticed I said I was taking little tiny dabs. That was not a joke
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.680]  I was not being uh facetious in any way i've had a little bit of dental work done
[01:37.760 --> 01:41.760]  So I must stick with little tiny dabs so I don't cause myself any problems
[01:42.080 --> 01:45.840]  If you're watching on the video, you may notice that one side of my face is a little bit puffy
[01:46.160 --> 01:49.040]  I feel like i'm recovering quite well and i'm ready to do a show
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.560]  The only thing you're going to notice is this red puffiness and some words don't come out right because i've had dental work
[01:54.720 --> 01:58.880]  And i'm adjusting to the new face, but I think we will be okay bear with me
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.280]  Make fun of me if you'd like to that's what we're here for but let's move forward to a podcast
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.560]  I just wanted to make sure you guys know why my face is all red on the right side
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.360]  Nobody punched me and if they did I fucking deserved it
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.800]  Uh, let's move forward. Let's do some shout outs to our friends who support the show on patreon big

[03:39.200 --> 03:42.320]  I talked about the dentist i'm red and puffy a little bit, but we're gonna live
[03:42.720 --> 03:49.040]  I've only got one more appointment and then we're done. Uh, let's move right forward to the breeding update. That's the next note on my list
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.760]  I'd like to keep you guys updated on what is happening in my gardens
[03:54.320 --> 04:01.280]  I'm sure if you've been following along, you know that I found a jack the ripper male and I have recently pollinated a few
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.760]  Select females in a small area with that jack the ripper male
[04:06.800 --> 04:08.240]  Uh, the pistols are brown
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.740]  The pistols are curled up on all of the females which indicates to me that I have got a successful
[04:13.420 --> 04:18.480]  Pollination i've made jack the ripper f2s from two different phenotypes of a female
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.500]  I've also made excuse me. I've also made a couple of jack the ripper out crosses. I have pollinated
[04:24.960 --> 04:31.280]  um a couple of very popular iree genetics lines and iree genetics, uh crosses with
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.840]  the jack the ripper male pollen
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.360]  It looks like the pollen has taken I said that the pistols have curled in when you pollinate a plant
[04:39.600 --> 04:46.160]  The pistols the hairs you guys the main function of those hairs on the plant. Those are to receive the pollen
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.480]  They're sticking out there. They're long and sticky. They're nice and thick when you got them nice and long and thick
[04:50.560 --> 04:56.560]  That's when they really want pollen. That's when the plant is really heavily ovulating the job of that hair is called a pistol
[04:56.560 --> 05:00.000]  Its job is to catch pollen and the pollen slides down that hair
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.000]  Into the ovule and that is where the magic happens. That is where the seed is formed
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.640]  That's where future generations come from. So those pistols are brown and crinkled up
[05:08.640 --> 05:14.320]  They've already been used up. Basically the ovule inside of there doesn't need pollination. So that pistol just curls up
[05:14.560 --> 05:19.600]  It tells me i've been pollinated. I've got a room filled a tent filled with brown pistols
[05:19.840 --> 05:25.280]  There are going to be so many fucking seeds in that room. I am excited. They are all brand new crosses
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.380]  I know that the females i've used produce quality offspring
[05:30.000 --> 05:37.200]  I know that the jack the ripper is a quality cross, but I do not know how the male I selected will play with the females
[05:37.280 --> 05:40.880]  I have pollinated so a lot of people right now are getting excited going man
[05:40.880 --> 05:45.600]  I can't wait to get some of those jack the ripper crosses. Please be very very patient
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.480]  I've still got four to six weeks to let the seeds grow. They've got to mature. They've got to harden
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.600]  They've got to get fat. They got to get shells on them. They got to finish up
[05:54.160 --> 05:56.560]  We got four to six weeks there. That's a month and a half
[05:57.040 --> 06:04.480]  Then i'll cut them down then they will honestly hang for two solid weeks before I do anything to them when I harvest seeded plants
[06:04.640 --> 06:05.980]  I let them dry
[06:05.980 --> 06:10.400]  Crispy crispy dry then I shuck the buds off the sticks into a container
[06:10.560 --> 06:14.960]  And I smash the buds up into small dust with my hands. I just kind of roll the buds in my hands
[06:14.960 --> 06:20.320]  It's so dry that it crumbles and as it crumbles you just hear the seeds rain out into the container ting ting ting ting ting
[06:20.720 --> 06:24.960]  Then I take that container filled with crumbled up bud. It's just dry shaky
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.280]  Bud it looks like you could just roll a bunch of joints out of it
[06:27.520 --> 06:31.920]  I run that through a machine that separates the material from the seeds and then i've got seeds
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.960]  What i'm saying is it's not going to be right away before these seeds are available. I've got
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.320]  Six weeks before they're harvested two weeks to let them dry
[06:40.640 --> 06:45.440]  Another week to pull them out and get the seeds sorted separated labeled and counted because I do count them all
[06:45.600 --> 06:48.640]  Before they go anywhere. I like to know how many seeds I made from each harvest
[06:49.360 --> 06:55.440]  Then once i've got them separated counted labeled all that stuff that's when I can think about testing them
[06:55.760 --> 07:00.880]  I will test them myself. I'll grow a batch of these seeds on my own before anybody gets to see them
[07:01.120 --> 07:06.480]  I will make sure we get good germination rates. I'll make sure that we don't have any hermaphrodites any weird mutants
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.320]  I'll make sure that the females that come out of this across are worth growing
[07:10.640 --> 07:15.120]  So there's a lot of work to be done before I can give any out before I can share any before I can sell
[07:15.200 --> 07:18.160]  Any uh before you can have them play with them test them
[07:18.800 --> 07:26.400]  Then once I have tested them, so you're looking at six weeks two weeks and then another uh, four or five week veg nine week flower
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.060]  we're at like
[07:28.060 --> 07:30.400]  22 weeks by now somewhere around there
[07:30.720 --> 07:34.080]  Then you may be able to see some testers because I want to grow them myself
[07:34.240 --> 07:36.240]  Then i'll send testers out to people
[07:36.480 --> 07:42.560]  Then we're looking at fucking 18 to 20 weeks before testers have results and finishers and photos and tests and all that shit back
[07:42.880 --> 07:46.960]  So we're like 40 something weeks before anybody is going to get to play with these seeds you guys
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.240]  I do appreciate the enthusiasm. I love the excitement for new crosses
[07:52.320 --> 07:54.160]  I'm just as excited as you are
[07:54.160 --> 08:00.000]  But when I start talking about it, it's going to be six months to a year before it is released to the market
[08:00.320 --> 08:01.200]  if
[08:01.200 --> 08:06.000]  If it even makes it to the market, there are crosses that i've made that will not go to market
[08:06.240 --> 08:10.320]  I'll share them with friends and i'll say hey, this isn't the best for this kind of environment
[08:10.320 --> 08:13.280]  But I know what you do this may work well for you and I give them a warning
[08:13.440 --> 08:17.840]  But there are some things I make that are just not going to go out to the general public
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.920]  I need experienced growers and veterans who can keep an eye on some shit to grow some of these
[08:22.240 --> 08:27.520]  So if they make it to the market, it will be what did I say? 40 weeks ish 42 weeks
[08:27.520 --> 08:30.960]  That's the better part of a year. Uh, we're cutting off 10 weeks of a year there
[08:31.200 --> 08:35.520]  So yeah, give me a year or so six months to a year before I get these testers out
[08:35.520 --> 08:39.680]  Let me get myself back on track the jack the ripper pollinated. It looks great in there
[08:39.840 --> 08:41.840]  Since you were so patient to listen to my ramblings
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.800]  Maybe I should be nice enough to tell you about a couple of the females that i've put in that room
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.960]  um, if you know me
[08:48.960 --> 08:52.320]  You already know that I put a female of one of my favorite cuts in there
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.000]  I threw a rise number four in that room
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.720]  So we will have a jack the ripper male pollinating a female arise number four
[09:00.720 --> 09:03.200]  Number four is the keeper that you guys see on social media
[09:03.440 --> 09:07.120]  There are others but number four is the stellar champion that i've fallen in love with
[09:07.600 --> 09:12.800]  Uh, so you'll have it's actually going to be a rise x jtr because you list the female first
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.480]  So a rise cross to jack the ripper. I also what else did I put in there? I can't even remember now. Oh
[09:19.280 --> 09:20.400]  Oh
[09:20.400 --> 09:23.200]  Um, there is a golden goat female in there
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.880]  What there's a golden goat female and they're about to get pollinated or pollinated by jack the ripper
[09:28.960 --> 09:33.360]  So we'll have goat ripper or jack the goat or somewhere around there. I don't know
[09:33.920 --> 09:38.160]  Um, send me a name idea for that one jack the ripper across the golden goat. What else do we have in there?
[09:38.160 --> 09:42.400]  I'll tell you about one more just while we're talking about it. We got jack the ripper f2s in there or f1
[09:42.480 --> 09:44.080]  We're gonna make f2s
[09:44.080 --> 09:47.120]  um, I don't know how much I want to share and how much I want to keep secret, but
[09:47.600 --> 09:53.680]  Uh, maybe there's a platinum tangy in there also, so we're gonna have some really orange jack the ripper turps. That's gonna be fucking awesome
[09:54.400 --> 09:56.720]  Anyways, that's what's going on in the breeding room
[09:57.280 --> 10:03.920]  Another thing in the breeding room, I am using canon led lighting from black sale market, please support black sale market
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.800]  They don't pay for advertising on the show. I am running their lights and I fucking approve you guys
[10:09.280 --> 10:11.920]  My plants look really healthy
[10:12.640 --> 10:18.640]  They grew with good vigor. They grew with really thick and robust stocks. The leaves are really thick
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.560]  They feel thicker than normal. They feel thicker than before
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.040]  I don't know if it's because of the vpd in that room or if it is because of the actual light
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.640]  I think it may be from the light i'm getting more. Uh, I think the better light is giving me chloroplast development
[10:32.720 --> 10:37.920]  Which is the building thicker stronger leaves? I don't know if that is accurate, but it's my assumption from what i'm seeing
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.360]  Um, I feel like they went into flower more quickly when I flip these plants into flower under the leds
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.760]  They really took off the male was like, oh you want pollen watch this and he just took off
[10:47.840 --> 10:52.000]  He's like i'll pollinate for you. I'll flip the girls were like you want me to flower i'll do that
[10:52.240 --> 10:56.240]  They had no problem flipping into flower. So i'm really impressed with the leds
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.760]  I don't have enough input on this seed development because seeds have not really gotten chunky or fat yet
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.220]  But i'm excited to see how the seeds develop under the leds
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.680]  I really like the colors
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.240]  I like being able to take photographs without having to turn off my lights when i'm growing under hid lights
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.120]  I turn off all the hid lighting to take photos or you get those shitty yellow washed out photos
[11:17.600 --> 11:22.480]  Underneath the leds they're putting out kick-ass bright white light. So I get really beautiful photos
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.480]  That white light combined with a phone flash. Oh, you can just kill it. So i'm really excited about the leds
[11:28.560 --> 11:31.760]  I'm, really excited about some jack the ripper crosses that will be coming out
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.120]  That's what's happening in my grow in my breeding space. I just like to keep you guys updated
[11:37.280 --> 11:44.080]  I feel like i've gone on long enough about that part. Where can we go next? Let's jump into patreon questions
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.640]  I have a lot of people supporting the show on patreon now
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.920]  I say that if you support the show on patreon and you send a question
[11:50.240 --> 11:56.080]  Those questions get sent to the top of the list. I just feel that uh, patreon contributors should get priority message reading
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.240]  So let's start off with some patreon messages for the podcast
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.640]  Like I said a moment ago if you're not supporting the show on patreon and you would like to do so simply visit
[12:05.180 --> 12:07.180]  www.patreon.com
[12:07.520 --> 12:12.560]  Forward slash grow from your heart. It is really easy to sign up and contribute to the patreon campaign
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.680]  Thank you for your help. The first patreon message for today's episode goes

[12:22.960 --> 12:29.440]  It is really appreciated. It has helped my growing keep it up white. Mike is a great ad from our friend vincent
[12:29.520 --> 12:31.920]  Hey vincent, thank you for the great compliments mike
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  I hope you're watching or listening to the show bro

[12:44.800 --> 12:48.100]  All right, big. Thanks to our friend vincent for the compliments on patreon
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.480]  Let's keep the show moving with another message from our friends on patreon
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.400]  This one goes a lot alike of this it says hey rasta jeff
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.320]  If you read this on the podcast, you can shout out my name. What's up victor?
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.080]  This one comes from our friend victor
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.440]  It says i've been a patreon supporter for quite a while now and i've been listening to your podcast for even longer
[13:07.520 --> 13:08.960]  Thank you for the support bro
[13:08.960 --> 13:13.680]  It goes on to say your lessons have helped me as a grower and reassured me on a lot of tips and advice
[13:13.760 --> 13:15.760]  i've already come across
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.360]  You know, sometimes, uh, you just need reminders and assurance and I like to remind people of the basics
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.240]  So i'm glad that my uh, my lessons are matching up with other shit that you have learned and i'm glad you're finding it to
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.680]  Be accurate
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.880]  So it says i'm very thankful for you sharing your knowledge and improving the quality of so many growers medicine
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.640]  Especially those that need this plant to have a better quality of life. That's what it's all about
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.380]  We need to use cannabis to improve the quality of our life if it's mentally if it's physically if it's spiritually
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.920]  As long as your life is better go for it
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.680]  Now it gets to the question part. It says my question for you is about alternating nodes
[13:51.920 --> 13:57.280]  I have a few grows under my belt now and i've always noticed the plants tend to alternate nodes when they begin to flower
[13:57.600 --> 13:59.600]  Which seems normal from what I can tell
[13:59.840 --> 14:06.480]  But I also noticed that my clones after a certain amount of growth began the same pattern of alternating their nodes
[14:07.120 --> 14:07.360]  All right
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.760]  So what I think he's talking about is when you grow
[14:10.640 --> 14:13.360]  A lot of times when you grow from seed the plant will go straight up
[14:13.680 --> 14:18.480]  And it will spit out a branch on the left and the right and they'll be parallel a couple inches later
[14:18.640 --> 14:21.120]  You'll get a branch from the it's left and right
[14:21.200 --> 14:24.400]  I guess we're going to say the up and down if you're looking at the plant from above
[14:24.640 --> 14:27.120]  It's a plus sign. You got north south east and west
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.600]  So most of the time it'll shoot out an east and west and then after that it'll show it up
[14:31.680 --> 14:34.400]  No, i'm it's not going to be east and west first i'm being hypothetical
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.720]  But you'll get an east and a west and then a north and a south and east and west and a north and a south
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.880]  So if you look at the plant straight from above it looks like you're looking at a plus sign
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.400]  So I think that's what he means by alternating nodes
[14:47.200 --> 14:49.200]  Now when you grow from clone
[14:49.200 --> 14:52.640]  you will notice that sometimes the nodes will go the
[14:53.280 --> 14:58.160]  East node and then it'll grow a little bit and then the west node and then it'll go up and then you get your north
[14:58.240 --> 15:00.240]  And then a little space and then a south
[15:00.960 --> 15:04.880]  I'm, not exactly sure what that caught what causes that in my brain
[15:05.040 --> 15:11.280]  I'm seeing the apical meristem of a plant from the main stalk of a plant that one grows the parallel branches
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.040]  The branches that grow off grow shoots and I think what you are seeing is alternating shoots
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.160]  I'm, not exactly sure that that's what i'm seeing from your interpret interpreting from your question
[15:22.480 --> 15:24.480]  But that's what I think you are
[15:24.540 --> 15:27.280]  Experiencing the shoots are alternating the branches will grow
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.600]  Side by side, but you said that that starts to happen with the clone after a while
[15:31.600 --> 15:37.040]  Yes, I have noticed that and I do not know what causes that phenomenon. So instead of the north south you'll get a little gap
[15:37.680 --> 15:40.320]  I'm, not sure what does that the golden goat makes?
[15:41.520 --> 15:46.800]  Six spins instead of north south east west it's got they're off kilter and there's another set in there
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.620]  So if you had north south east and west you'd have one that went southeast in there southwest
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.280]  Like yeah, it would go diagonal across and it just spins all the way up
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.120]  So it makes kind of a spiral staircase looking thing if you get it really happy
[15:59.760 --> 16:02.480]  So i'm not sure what causes that but there's more to the question
[16:02.480 --> 16:04.240]  It says due to space limitations
[16:04.240 --> 16:08.880]  I keep my clones in solo cups until they reach about one to one and a half feet tall now
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.280]  You're giving me hints of what's going on and then I clone them again to keep them small
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.200]  Could it be that the small solo cups are triggering the clones to auto flower?
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.960]  Or is it alternating nodes on clones or is the alternating nodes on clones a normal occurrence?
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.800]  I haven't been cloning for long
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.560]  This is my second set of clones totaling six clone strains and it's been fairly consistent trend in my tent
[16:30.880 --> 16:38.240]  I'm, also running my lights 20 hours on and four off as suggested one of your episodes to combat auto flowering tendencies in strains
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.440]  Thanks again for all you do take care and stay healthy signed from victor victor. This is a good question
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.280]  I think I understand what you're talking about here in the second part
[16:47.520 --> 16:50.320]  Um, you're letting the plants get too big in those solo cups, dude
[16:50.320 --> 16:55.280]  They are angry. They want to flower if they are too tight in those cups. They will begin to flower
[16:55.600 --> 16:58.320]  you're kind of taking clones from plants that may
[16:59.120 --> 17:04.720]  Uh have hormones that are ready to start flowering the hormones in those plants are a little bit pissed off freaked out
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.640]  They're going dude. We've been in a solo cup for way too long. Their shoes are way too tight
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.320]  They're getting angry about it. So they may be trying to flower on you because of that
[17:12.800 --> 17:16.400]  Um, man, I would definitely you can keep them in the cups if that's what you want to do
[17:16.400 --> 17:19.200]  But I would give them a bigger root zone. You can keep them small
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.040]  You can keep them short by topping them and training them and pruning them. You don't have to
[17:23.680 --> 17:26.240]  Punish them by keeping them in cups get them out of the cups
[17:26.560 --> 17:30.320]  You'll see much instead of just tall lanky skinny plants if you get them out of the cups
[17:30.320 --> 17:34.240]  They'll branch out a little bit. They won't go up so hard if you give them some space
[17:34.960 --> 17:40.400]  Um, I know that doesn't sound logical, but it is real if you give them more space a bigger pot
[17:40.560 --> 17:45.680]  They'll bush out more. I kind of think that a plant kind of works like this. Um
[17:46.880 --> 17:48.880]  if you only have let's
[17:48.960 --> 17:52.480]  Think about a person if you're real tall and skinny and you got your feet together and I push you
[17:52.720 --> 17:55.440]  You're gonna wobble because your gravity is all fucked up
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.080]  If you spread your feet and I push you you've got more a chance of not falling over
[18:00.720 --> 18:05.280]  I think the plant doesn't want to get too wide because it doesn't have a big wide root base
[18:05.360 --> 18:09.120]  If it gets too tall too wide up top, it's going to topple over and it knows that it's like
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.520]  My roots are only this fucking big. I better not branch out too far. Let's go up
[18:13.680 --> 18:16.880]  Let's just keep going up and so you're kind of punishing the plant
[18:17.120 --> 18:23.680]  You're not giving yourself as much success as you could get you're kind of limiting your options by having big tall lanky stretchy plants
[18:24.320 --> 18:29.360]  So I really think that you should up pot them sooner. I don't know your environment. I don't know your space
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.760]  I may be talking completely irrational bullshit right now, but that is what I would suggest
[18:34.480 --> 18:36.960]  So I do think that maybe having those
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.820]  Plants in those cups for too long may be leading to a lot of your questionable plant performance
[18:43.520 --> 18:45.120]  um
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.720]  That's pretty much my diagnosis there put them in bigger pots earlier
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.600]  And then I think that the hormones in the plants won't be trying to switch over to flower. Uh so quickly
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.800]  So they're in the part about 24 hours 20 hours on and four hours off. Yes
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.600]  That will help the plants not auto flower
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.680]  But it's not going to stop them if they are in too small of a pot
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.240]  They'll still get mad at you and they will still flower
[19:08.960 --> 19:14.560]  So there is a follow-up to this. Uh, victor did send a second email and it goes. Oh also regarding clones
[19:14.800 --> 19:21.280]  I had one clone grow all weird with only sets of three fingers on the leaves and super bushy and it flowered
[19:21.600 --> 19:25.760]  It kept growing in the same pattern and was a mess to keep under control due to the insane
[19:26.080 --> 19:33.280]  Amount of small branches growing everywhere. I took the clone during veg, but it looks like what i've heard described as monster cropping
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.760]  What happened to my clone? Thank you again rasta. Jeff. You are the best
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.640]  All right, victor this message gives me even more clues that your uh,
[19:43.040 --> 19:45.520]  Root bound clones are going into flower
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.640]  They are mad enough about being root bound that they are triggering the hormones in themselves to go into flower
[19:50.880 --> 19:54.480]  But I think your light cycle is barely keeping them from flowering
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.760]  So you took a clone from one of these plants was there was on the verge of flipping into flower
[20:00.080 --> 20:03.680]  And it rooted and it made roots, but it had already told itself
[20:03.760 --> 20:06.960]  Hey, i'm fucking flowering and you didn't stop it. You couldn't stop it
[20:06.960 --> 20:09.440]  It wasn't anything well, it was stuff you did but I mean it was doing that
[20:09.760 --> 20:15.840]  So then you flowered it and you basically did flower a monster cropped clone. The hormones were going crazy
[20:15.840 --> 20:20.320]  The plant was trying to figure out life. That's why you got weird shoots, uh crazy super branching
[20:20.560 --> 20:23.360]  It wasn't sure what to do with life. It was simply trying to survive
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.680]  So that does kind of support my idea that your plants are getting
[20:27.980 --> 20:34.160]  Frustrated at you for keeping them in too small of a pot and I think you could solve this issue by simply either
[20:34.880 --> 20:37.680]  The first issue is to or the first solution is to go to bigger pots
[20:38.400 --> 20:42.160]  Maybe you need to reduce the amount of plants you have to create more space
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.000]  They aren't going to get super tall as quickly if you give them a bigger pot
[20:46.080 --> 20:50.640]  Like I said earlier that doesn't sound like it makes sense, but it really will help they'll slow down the stretch
[20:50.800 --> 20:54.720]  They won't get as tall they'll start going wider and wider plants are always ideal
[20:54.880 --> 20:59.760]  We do a lot of work to make them wider. We really try to train them to give them wider bushes
[21:00.080 --> 21:00.960]  All right
[21:00.960 --> 21:04.960]  I'm gonna take a drink here. I gotta minimize my consumption of dabs and drinks
[21:04.960 --> 21:07.520]  I don't want to mess up the dental work, but my throat's burning out
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.760]  So let's take a quick drink and we'll get back to another message
[21:15.980 --> 21:18.780]  All right, you guys thank you for dealing with me, uh
[21:19.820 --> 21:22.380]  Well, i've got a uh puffy face and a messed up voice
[21:22.620 --> 21:25.580]  I just feel like the show must go on and I was hanging out and it's up
[21:25.900 --> 21:29.980]  I had the night to myself the house was free. I felt silly sitting here watching cartoons
[21:30.140 --> 21:35.660]  I thought maybe I should do a podcast. I watched that. Uh, the toys that made us. Uh, that was kind of cool, man
[21:35.660 --> 21:37.500]  I watched the ninja turtle episode since you know
[21:37.500 --> 21:42.480]  I put out the ninja turtle line that show brought back some super memories made me uh, super nostalgic
[21:42.620 --> 21:44.380]  I remembered where I was
[21:44.380 --> 21:47.820]  And what grade I was in and where I bought my set of ninja turtle toys
[21:47.820 --> 21:50.460]  Like I got all four turtles once it's like a I did good in school
[21:50.460 --> 21:52.940]  So I got all four of the turtles. I remember where I bought them
[21:53.100 --> 21:55.660]  I remember how excited I was at school
[21:55.820 --> 21:59.100]  Like I get to go home and play with my ninja turtles after school is all I could think about you guys
[21:59.180 --> 22:05.340]  I'm way off track. Um, let's get back into these patreon messages. This one says hey rasta jeff
[22:05.740 --> 22:10.300]  I've been a long time listener and I really appreciate what you do for the growing community. Thank you
[22:10.300 --> 22:11.420]  That means a lot to me
[22:11.420 --> 22:15.340]  It says i'm happy to be a supporter of the show and I look forward to every episode
[22:15.420 --> 22:18.140]  You're gonna love this one because I am reading your message
[22:18.620 --> 22:21.500]  It goes on to say I have got a light leak question
[22:21.580 --> 22:25.580]  I've been growing autos for a little over a year and I would like to try my hand at some of your
[22:25.900 --> 22:30.460]  Regular seeds for next season. So this person has been growing auto flower seeds
[22:30.940 --> 22:35.580]  Which I have nothing against but I do recommend trying some regular seeds just to see what it's like
[22:35.740 --> 22:39.740]  You get to control the veg phase you get to top pop twist lollipop
[22:39.740 --> 22:44.140]  You get to do all kinds of different shit that we don't do with autos. So I think you will have fun
[22:44.940 --> 22:48.540]  It goes on to say I have read and I have heard from a few sources
[22:48.700 --> 22:54.320]  That it's really important to prevent any light from getting into the grow during lights out while growing regulars
[22:54.620 --> 22:58.060]  I think that's also important when growing uh autos, but I don't know
[22:58.540 --> 23:04.220]  If it's equally as important as important it goes on to say I realize that keeping light out can prevent messing up your plants
[23:04.620 --> 23:07.180]  But to what extent do they really have to go?
[23:07.260 --> 23:11.020]  I've had people tell me that they go as far as to cover the led on the power bar
[23:11.500 --> 23:15.900]  And go to big lengths to make sure zero light never gets in during lights out
[23:16.300 --> 23:22.860]  How important is this plants that grow outside don't get messed up from lights with a full moon and a friend's outdoor backyard
[23:22.940 --> 23:26.940]  Grow wasn't ruined by car headlights that drove by once in a while. That's a very good point
[23:27.020 --> 23:29.020]  I've got a very good supporting argument for that
[23:29.340 --> 23:32.780]  It says I fully understand what can happen with lighting up your plants during lights out
[23:33.020 --> 23:36.240]  But where's the line between good prevention and paranoia?
[23:36.720 --> 23:42.960]  You can use my name as darren w if this makes it onto the show what up darren w thank you for the great question
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.360]  Let's dig in to this one
[23:45.840 --> 23:51.680]  Um, they want to know how important is total darkness during the night cycle in a flowering phase
[23:53.040 --> 23:59.780]  In my opinion in an indoor environment the dark cycle is very critical to not be interrupted
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.760]  Interruption of dark cycles or light leaks are the number one cause to trigger a hermaphroditic
[24:07.300 --> 24:13.560]  Or intersex trait in a cannabis plant light leaks are the number one cause for hermaphrodites
[24:13.860 --> 24:17.780]  You guys that is the number one trigger for a problem in a grow
[24:18.100 --> 24:25.140]  So in my opinion any light is a problem a speck of light for 30 seconds may be a problem
[24:25.380 --> 24:29.380]  I don't want any light in there when I put my hand over my eyes
[24:29.620 --> 24:34.600]  I want that much darkness in my grow room. I want it to feel like somebody's got me fucking blindfolded
[24:34.740 --> 24:36.740]  I want to feel like i'm lost in there
[24:37.460 --> 24:43.620]  I want to feel like like I just want to feel like it's total pitch black darkness almost scary darkness in that grow room
[24:43.780 --> 24:48.180]  When the lights are off no matter what it looks like outside, even if it is sunshiny outside
[24:48.420 --> 24:52.180]  I better not have any light shining through whatever i've chosen to block off the window
[24:52.580 --> 24:56.020]  No light shining through any gaps. No lights coming from underneath the door
[24:56.180 --> 24:59.220]  I don't want any lights in my grow room during the night phase
[24:59.220 --> 25:04.660]  Like I said that will lead to issues sometimes if you've got light leaks the plants will not even flower
[25:04.980 --> 25:09.380]  I did a consultation for a guy. He called me up. He's like, hey, bro, my plants aren't flowering
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.020]  I've been in flower for like six weeks. They don't look like they're doing anything
[25:12.100 --> 25:15.940]  I was like, well, this is weird and I went over to the grow and I looked at the grow and I was like your plants
[25:15.940 --> 25:18.420]  Are fully in veg. What do you mean? You're not in flower?
[25:18.420 --> 25:20.260]  And he's like my lights on 12 12
[25:20.260 --> 25:21.860]  And I was like, can you prove that and he's like well
[25:21.860 --> 25:24.900]  I mean I got a timer and it says they go off at this time and i've been in here when they go off
[25:24.900 --> 25:26.900]  And I leave and I come back the next day and they're on
[25:27.300 --> 25:29.620]  I'm, like, okay timer cycles. I go
[25:30.180 --> 25:35.380]  It's daytime right now outside. The lights are on do me a favor close the door turn off the lights
[25:35.460 --> 25:38.760]  You turned off the lights close the door. There was fucking sunshine
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.100]  Blasting through not just through the wall the thing he put up on the wall to cover the windows
[25:44.260 --> 25:47.060]  But also through all of the ducting that he ran through the lights
[25:47.060 --> 25:53.940]  He had vented hoods and there was light coming through the duct sunshine coming through the duct through the light shining right onto the plants
[25:53.940 --> 25:59.140]  It looked like he had the grow lights on so his plants were never getting a dark cycle because he was running that dark
[25:59.140 --> 26:03.780]  Cycle at like 5 p.m. So at 5 p.m. It's still fucking light outside the lights went off
[26:03.940 --> 26:08.420]  They were still getting plenty of light. It was summertime. I think we stay stays light to about nine o'clock
[26:08.500 --> 26:09.860]  He was getting four extra hours of light
[26:09.860 --> 26:14.980]  He didn't even know about those plants were not going to flower until it got dark outside a little earlier
[26:15.620 --> 26:21.220]  So my buddy was not getting flowering plants. My client was not getting flowering plants because of a light leak
[26:21.620 --> 26:26.260]  It was a major light leak, but it is why they did not flower light is what controls the plants
[26:26.740 --> 26:31.540]  Now you're going to ask the next thing you ask is why don't they fuck up outdoors?
[26:32.820 --> 26:35.460]  That is a wonderful question and i've got a really good answer
[26:35.860 --> 26:39.940]  I've got to think about it because I didn't research this I wasn't prepared but here goes my brain
[26:40.420 --> 26:44.500]  As the sun sets it puts off a spectrum known as far red
[26:45.380 --> 26:50.100]  Something in the sky the reflection in the sky turns that light to far red that far red light
[26:50.740 --> 26:52.180]  triggers a
[26:52.180 --> 26:57.780]  Response in the plant a phytochrome response in the plant that tells the plant. Hey, the sun's going down
[26:57.940 --> 27:00.980]  You should go to sleep. So that basically tucks the plant in
[27:00.980 --> 27:04.420]  It's like giving the plants a little bit of night quiller pulling the off switch for the plants
[27:04.900 --> 27:10.100]  That phytochrome red makes them go to sleep. So they are much more put to sleep than they are
[27:10.500 --> 27:14.820]  Uh without that phytochrome red. They're kind of tucked in. They've got a little blanket over them
[27:14.820 --> 27:18.660]  They got a couple ambient in them. They're doing just fine in a grow room indoors
[27:18.980 --> 27:26.500]  We don't get phytochrome red. We don't have that some people are installing far red lights in their lighting setups
[27:26.580 --> 27:28.820]  Now I can't remember the name of the company and they didn't pay me anyway
[27:28.900 --> 27:35.780]  But there are companies who are including far red lights in their led setups. Those plants will go to sleep more quickly
[27:36.340 --> 27:41.860]  They will be so a lot of times we see the sun go down and we get we get 14 hours of daylight
[27:41.940 --> 27:46.500]  But our plants go into flower that is because as they are setting as the sun sets that last couple of hours
[27:46.660 --> 27:52.580]  We're getting phytochrome red we're getting far red the plants are going to sleep so outside they're tucked in
[27:53.780 --> 27:56.660]  Indoors, they're not tucked in if you interrupt them indoors
[27:56.900 --> 28:02.900]  It is the same similar intensity of light that gets to those plants as they got during the day during their day
[28:03.140 --> 28:09.620]  They can't tell the difference. They go. Oh light bulb light bulb. I should wake up outdoors. Our plants got phytochrome red
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.860]  They got a couple of ambient in them. They had a couple of drinks
[28:11.860 --> 28:16.900]  They're fucking sleeping hard if you shine a flashlight on them, they go. Ah, bro. I had the sun all day
[28:16.900 --> 28:22.180]  That ain't shit. The sun is the biggest light you could ever imagine. We cannot replicate it
[28:22.340 --> 28:25.460]  It is the biggest ball of energy that there is that I am aware of that
[28:25.460 --> 28:30.100]  I think anybody else is fucking aware of we cannot copy that all day long when we're making grow lights
[28:30.180 --> 28:34.420]  We're trying to mimic the power of the sun. We cannot do it. No matter how good your grow lights are
[28:34.660 --> 28:38.820]  You can't copy the sun. So the sun shines on those plants all day
[28:38.980 --> 28:44.740]  It's getting the perfect spectrum the most umols lumens watts, but it's not getting watts
[28:44.740 --> 28:47.140]  But it's getting all the measurements of light that you can imagine
[28:47.300 --> 28:52.260]  It's getting soaked in them and it is getting the perfect perfect spectrum because it is nature
[28:52.260 --> 28:57.620]  It is the sun whatever you believe in whatever god you believe in the sun should be high on the list of things you appreciate
[28:58.180 --> 29:02.900]  Because the sun is the source of life sun and water without those I think everything else probably just fall apart
[29:03.300 --> 29:06.260]  So the sun is out there the plants are getting hit by sun all day
[29:06.420 --> 29:10.900]  When you shine some car lights on there the sun goes now you got a flashlight good job, buddy
[29:10.980 --> 29:14.740]  I've been in the fucking sun all day and I got a bunch of ambien and a bunch of drinks in me
[29:14.820 --> 29:22.120]  My fucking flashlight ain't gonna wake me up. So that is why the plants don't freak out outdoors when you get light interruptions
[29:22.500 --> 29:28.660]  Now sometimes the plants may freak out outdoors if you get small light interruptions, but they've got to be
[29:29.300 --> 29:31.300]  They probably got to be bigger than like a flashlight
[29:31.540 --> 29:34.180]  Maybe if you've got a street light above your house in your backyard
[29:34.260 --> 29:40.660]  Or maybe if you've got some sort of lighting above you maybe a security light that sort of stuff can disrupt your outdoor plants
[29:40.740 --> 29:43.060]  But it's got to be close and it's got to be intense
[29:43.540 --> 29:50.900]  But that far red light is why we don't have as many light leak issues outdoors and the sun and the moon
[29:51.140 --> 29:56.980]  Uh, that's nature, bro. The plants know that that moon is something good. They don't freak out about that. Um,
[29:57.700 --> 30:03.780]  They're they're sleeping from the phytochrome in the far red. So I think I explained that I think I rambled on quite a bit about
[30:03.860 --> 30:09.620]  That I want to thank my friend Darren W for the great message. I have got one more patreon message
[30:09.620 --> 30:13.300]  I want to try to read in this episode before my voice burns out completely
[30:13.700 --> 30:18.580]  This one comes from our friend northern turps. No north north turps. Sorry. Didn't mean to fuck that up
[30:18.900 --> 30:20.660]  It goes like this
[30:20.660 --> 30:21.780]  Hey rasta, jeff
[30:21.780 --> 30:27.060]  Just want to start by saying thank you so much for all you do and your show and I just want to give you a big
[30:27.140 --> 30:33.060]  Shout out. I appreciate all the information I get from you with that being said I was wondering about my
[30:33.840 --> 30:35.860]  recirculating deep water culture system
[30:36.500 --> 30:41.060]  Um, then honestly, there are a couple of typos here and I can't figure out exactly what it says
[30:41.140 --> 30:47.060]  But it goes on to say can I start my seedlings out the first couple of weeks of their life using half ro and half?
[30:47.380 --> 30:50.180]  Tap water we have talked about this in a previous episode
[30:50.660 --> 30:56.340]  I don't know why you would mix ro and tap water if you're using ro use ro if you're using tap use tap
[30:56.900 --> 30:59.940]  Uh, that's like cleaning the floor and pissing on half of it
[31:00.500 --> 31:06.580]  Maybe that's extreme, but I don't know why you would clean water completely clean and then add not clean water back to it
[31:06.740 --> 31:13.220]  Just use the dirty water. Don't waste the time and energy halfway cleaning it or use the fucking clean water. Uh, you got it use it
[31:13.700 --> 31:17.860]  Um, you can use half and half maybe maybe it's easier to i've got an idea
[31:17.860 --> 31:23.220]  Maybe it's a little bit easier to buffer solutions if you mix that non-ph or that non-ro water in there
[31:23.780 --> 31:26.020]  Uh, just use tap water if that's the route you're gonna go
[31:26.420 --> 31:33.460]  Um, and it says what do you suggest when transplanting my seedlings for my router to cubes and rockwool cubes
[31:33.700 --> 31:37.380]  See, I think you had fat fingers and I think you mistyped that one there
[31:38.020 --> 31:42.180]  But you're trying to go from rockwool cubes to hydroton media in the system
[31:42.900 --> 31:44.340]  um, so
[31:44.340 --> 31:49.300]  You can just take that rockwool cube fill your you probably have a basket that sits it hangs in the bucket
[31:49.540 --> 31:54.580]  Just fill that basket with your hydroton and just set that cube right inside there deep enough to where you know
[31:54.580 --> 32:00.420]  It's getting wet. It should start getting some roots hanging out of the bottom. Honestly, uh, deep water culture is not my thing
[32:00.500 --> 32:04.900]  I'm, not an expert. I don't know a lot about it, but you've got that rockwool cube in a clone
[32:04.900 --> 32:06.900]  It's got some uh the clone in the cube
[32:06.900 --> 32:11.780]  It's got some roots hanging out of the bottom when you put that in your basket with the hydroton clay pellets
[32:11.780 --> 32:17.700]  Just make sure it's low enough in there that the water is misting and contacting the bottom of those roots the bottom of that cube
[32:17.940 --> 32:22.580]  And I think it will be okay. I'm, not exactly sure what your question was because
[32:23.140 --> 32:25.780]  Um, man, I got nothing but love and respect but you kind of
[32:26.500 --> 32:30.580]  I think auto correct ruined your day on this one, buddy, but thank you for the great message
[32:30.580 --> 32:36.040]  It says i'm running general hydroponics and I have a full line of gh products as well as some great white bacteria
[32:36.580 --> 32:41.300]  I think you'll have great success with those products and with the great white just be very careful
[32:41.300 --> 32:47.300]  Make sure your ph stays in line check your ppms often keep in mind that in a deep water culture system
[32:47.780 --> 32:52.740]  Water will evaporate as the water evaporates your ph will change and your ec will change
[32:53.620 --> 32:57.540]  The nutrients are not going to evaporate. They are solids. They're salts
[32:57.540 --> 33:00.820]  They're heavy the water will evaporate the nutrients will stay in there
[33:01.060 --> 33:07.300]  Your ph will change and your ppms will rise as the water evaporates make sure to check that on a daily
[33:07.620 --> 33:10.980]  Basis write down the ppms write down the ph every day
[33:11.380 --> 33:14.100]  If you can check it every 12 hours check it when you wake up
[33:14.260 --> 33:16.580]  Check it when you get home from work or whatever you do all day
[33:16.820 --> 33:17.540]  Just check on it
[33:17.540 --> 33:25.460]  Make sure that shit is in line because very small mistakes in deep water culture can lead to very big disasters and they change rapidly
[33:25.700 --> 33:30.740]  Uh, if it's a warm day, you got a lot of bubbles going on you can bubble off a couple of cups of water
[33:30.980 --> 33:37.080]  No problem in that bubbling system all that air in there really creates a nice mist. It creates a lot of evaporation
[33:37.380 --> 33:40.420]  You'll get some loss, especially in a hot dry room. It'll be humid
[33:40.740 --> 33:43.140]  All your water from your buckets is now up in the air
[33:43.540 --> 33:47.620]  Make sure you check on that keep the humidity in line, but it sounds like you're off to a good start
[33:47.620 --> 33:51.620]  You're worrying about getting that little baby into the cubes or into the pellets
[33:51.860 --> 33:54.900]  I think you could just kind of get the basket put a small layer
[33:54.900 --> 33:58.420]  Maybe one layer of hydroton then put the clone in there and then just fill it up
[33:58.660 --> 34:01.460]  Uh, you're going to kind of cover the stock but make sure the plant's sticking out
[34:01.700 --> 34:06.500]  You won't drown it. You won't smother it because the the pellets have plenty of space in there and then eventually
[34:06.820 --> 34:09.700]  Uh that thing will just start to fill up that whole section with roots
[34:09.860 --> 34:14.260]  It'll be one big basket and a bucket filled with roots. It'll be fucking awesome
[34:14.580 --> 34:17.620]  All right. I hope I answered your question. There were some typos in there
[34:17.620 --> 34:21.940]  It was a little bit hard to read. I do speak stoner. I speak dabanese and turpanese
[34:21.940 --> 34:27.460]  So sometimes I can decipher your code if there is more to that that I need to decipher and reply to please
[34:27.780 --> 34:32.980]  Resend that message. I'd be more than happy to help you out. Uh next time don't type while you're driving. I don't know
[34:33.620 --> 34:36.500]  But my buddy north north turps, thank you for the great message
[34:36.580 --> 34:40.660]  I'm, not sure if i'm supposed to say your real name. So thank you for all of the patreon support

[35:05.140 --> 35:07.140]  Uh, thanks for putting up with this swollen side of my face
[35:07.460 --> 35:10.020]  It looks like it's swelled up a little bit more while I was talking
[35:10.180 --> 35:12.820]  I'm gonna go take a break put some ice on my face. I think we'll be all right
[35:12.820 --> 35:18.260]  Don't worry about me guys. Uh, the rough part is over now the extraction I heard and felt the fucking tooth come out
[35:18.580 --> 35:22.740]  That was weird, but we're out of that now. It's all over. Um, hope I didn't just gross you out
[35:22.900 --> 35:27.540]  But if I did you'll be okay. I fucking had to deal with it. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out
