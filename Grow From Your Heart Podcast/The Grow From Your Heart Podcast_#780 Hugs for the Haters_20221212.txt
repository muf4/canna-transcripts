[01:55.270 --> 01:59.230]  start this episode off by talking about some fun that I got to have this week
[01:59.230 --> 02:05.390]  just recently allegedly possibly maybe I was invited to attend a Green Dot Labs
[02:05.550 --> 02:10.910]  tasting event and party. It was mainly a bud tender educational event. I'm not a
[02:10.910 --> 02:14.710]  bud tender. I don't work for a facility but Green Dot knows who I am. They know
[02:14.710 --> 02:19.030]  that I enjoy and promote their products quite heavily so they did invite me to
[02:19.030 --> 02:22.830]  come to their party and enjoy their tasting and educational event. It was
[02:22.830 --> 02:26.230]  quite a great event. It was perfect. It was quite an experience. It was
[02:26.230 --> 02:30.350]  quite a terpy evening if I do so say say so myself. That's harder to say than it
[02:30.350 --> 02:33.190]  looks. I've got a lot of great notes here. Let me scroll to these notes and get
[02:33.190 --> 02:37.070]  myself on track. It was a great event. It was I can't even tell you where it was.
[02:37.070 --> 02:42.030]  It was in Denver. That's good enough. It was at a location that had non-alcoholic
[02:42.030 --> 02:46.750]  beverages provided. They provided pizza and then most importantly they provided
[02:46.750 --> 02:52.910]  plenty of dabs. They had a nice dab bar set up. A little educational pamphlets
[02:52.910 --> 02:56.030]  everywhere so you can read and learn about the products. They would have a dab
[02:56.030 --> 03:00.790]  multiple dab station set up and at those stations some had rosin and some had
[03:00.910 --> 03:04.110]  batter. They would have a little placard or a little sign to let you know what
[03:04.110 --> 03:08.630]  strains were at that table. So it would be like rosin or I would say live
[03:08.630 --> 03:12.230]  batter and then it would say like Fortissimo or Rainbow Belts or whatever
[03:12.230 --> 03:16.310]  strains were at that table. One table had batter, one had rosin, another table had
[03:16.310 --> 03:19.430]  batter, another had rosin. There are several tables so you never had to wait
[03:19.430 --> 03:22.990]  in too long of a line to get a dab. If you just went if you took a dab and then
[03:22.990 --> 03:25.550]  went and walked around for a minute and got in line you'd get another dab in
[03:25.550 --> 03:29.070]  plenty of time. There was no rush. It was a really great event. They did it very
[03:29.110 --> 03:32.950]  well. Everything was well organized. You did of course have to get an invite then
[03:32.950 --> 03:36.350]  you had to get a ticket then you had to show your ticket and ID to even enter
[03:36.350 --> 03:40.590]  the building which I thought was perfect. It was a private party but it was such a
[03:40.590 --> 03:45.030]  good time. There were several booths. Each booth I think was offering
[03:45.030 --> 03:49.350]  three different varieties of Green Dot products. I got to try a lot of great
[03:49.350 --> 03:52.990]  stuff that I've never had before and then I got to try things that I have had
[03:52.990 --> 03:57.070]  before in a different setting off of a different smoking device, off of a
[03:57.070 --> 04:00.710]  different rig perhaps through a Puffco but it was really good smoking
[04:00.710 --> 04:04.150]  concentrates I'm familiar with in a different environment with different
[04:04.150 --> 04:07.310]  people getting a different experience from the same flavors but then also
[04:07.310 --> 04:11.390]  being exposed to brand new things that are up and coming from Green Dot. Some
[04:11.390 --> 04:15.910]  I'm not even sure I can tell you about so far but I tried a lot of batters. I
[04:15.910 --> 04:20.990]  smoked a lot of rosins. I think my favorite of the evening was the Rainbow
[04:20.990 --> 04:25.630]  Belt V2. I think it was live rosin. It tasted like rosin. It felt like rosin. It
[04:25.630 --> 04:30.070]  was freaking delicious. I hit it kind of hot. The guy was kind of kind of confused
[04:30.070 --> 04:34.270]  why I like to go so hot but I like them hot and hurdy bro but it tastes really
[04:34.270 --> 04:38.470]  good. It was the Rainbow Belt V2 live rosin. Pretty sure it was my favorite. If
[04:38.470 --> 04:42.670]  it wasn't rosin it was batter. It tastes super good. It had all of the right
[04:42.670 --> 04:47.510]  terps, all of the right flavors. It was gassy. It was fruity. It had that diesel
[04:47.510 --> 04:50.550]  thing to it at the bottom. When you exhale it's like it leaves a thing on
[04:50.550 --> 04:54.550]  your tongue but then it left berries in my nose. Really beautiful, really good
[04:54.590 --> 05:00.790]  flavors from that. The Rainbow Belt V2. It was a good social experience. I don't
[05:00.790 --> 05:03.990]  go out to bars and things. I don't drink alcohol. The only reason I'm really at a
[05:03.990 --> 05:07.870]  show or at a club or at a bar or anything is for a show, a comedy show or
[05:07.870 --> 05:11.550]  some music. So to be invited to something social where there was not alcohol, it
[05:11.550 --> 05:16.230]  was not an alcohol-based event. We could actually go smoke and enjoy smoking
[05:16.230 --> 05:19.310]  concentrates in public. There were smoking flower in there as well but when I
[05:19.310 --> 05:22.550]  smoke too much flower in public or too much flower at all my throat gets dry
[05:22.550 --> 05:26.310]  and scratchy. I can't talk right. So try to stick with the dabs at public smoking
[05:26.310 --> 05:31.430]  and educational events. But it's a really fun... the bar was basically closed as a
[05:31.430 --> 05:34.910]  bar and it was just turned into a hangout establishment so there was no
[05:34.910 --> 05:38.830]  alcohol being served. It was all non-alcoholic cocktails, plenty of water,
[05:38.830 --> 05:42.150]  hydration. The restrooms were easily accessible. There was free pizza
[05:42.150 --> 05:46.110]  available, even vegetarian friendly pizza for the veggie heads over there. That was
[05:46.110 --> 05:51.150]  me. But it was a really great experience. One thing I did notice is that I made a
[05:51.190 --> 05:55.910]  joke about the Puff Co is the new Bud Light. Nobody had a beer in that event
[05:55.910 --> 05:59.230]  because it was an alcohol-free establishment but everybody was
[05:59.230 --> 06:03.630]  carrying a Puff Co. And I used to frequent alcohol drinking bars. I used to go to the
[06:03.630 --> 06:06.350]  bar all the time you guys and everybody's got the way that they hold
[06:06.350 --> 06:10.630]  their beer. Some guys hold the beer up here by their chest. Some guys do the
[06:10.630 --> 06:14.270]  arm curl in and kind of tuck it real close to their chest. Some guys just hold
[06:14.270 --> 06:17.430]  it here. Some guys hold it down here. We all have our place where we hold our
[06:17.430 --> 06:20.590]  beer. It was funny noticing everybody... I don't drink anymore so I don't hold my
[06:20.590 --> 06:24.310]  beer. I hold my Puff Co. It was funny noticing how everybody just where your
[06:24.310 --> 06:27.390]  Puff Co was placed in your holding position. I thought it was really
[06:27.390 --> 06:31.430]  entertaining. So the Puff Co Peak or the Puff Co Guardian or maybe even the proxy
[06:31.430 --> 06:35.990]  is the new Bud Light at Hangout establishments. I thought that was very
[06:35.990 --> 06:39.910]  interesting. That's enough rambling about the Green Dot event. I wanted to share
[06:39.910 --> 06:43.030]  that with you guys. I had a good time. I thought it was really great to go smoke
[06:43.030 --> 06:46.430]  concentrates and socialize. That's what I did. I took a couple of dabs. I went and
[06:46.430 --> 06:49.790]  talked to a couple of people. I talked to people I knew. They knew people standing
[06:49.790 --> 06:52.910]  there that I didn't know. Now I know those people. I made a bunch of friends.
[06:52.910 --> 06:56.830]  I made some Instagram friends. Got some followers. I'm following new people. Got
[06:56.830 --> 07:00.270]  some new bros to kick it and take dabs with. And I got to smoke and learn about
[07:00.270 --> 07:04.030]  some great Green Dot concentrates. So that was the event. It was a really good
[07:04.030 --> 07:08.110]  night. I got to walk around with the Puff Co and just rip that at will. You could
[07:08.110 --> 07:10.870]  walk up to a booth and they say what do you want to try? And say I want to hit
[07:10.870 --> 07:14.270]  the sex on the beach. They'd pass you the sex on the beach container and a dabber
[07:14.270 --> 07:17.590]  and you just put some in your Puff Co and then rip it as it was. They're really
[07:17.710 --> 07:21.110]  generous and really friendly about it. It was a great event. So big shout out to
[07:21.110 --> 07:24.870]  Green Dot Labs. Big shout out to Casey from Green Dot Labs. Casey is the one
[07:24.870 --> 07:28.430]  that invited me. Big shout out to the whole crew. I got to meet everybody from
[07:28.430 --> 07:31.790]  Green Dot. All the people that were there. So big shout out to everybody. I'm
[07:31.790 --> 07:34.430]  not even going to try to list all names. It would take me forever. So big shout
[07:34.430 --> 07:38.870]  out to the whole crew. I look forward to seeing you guys next time. And multiple
[07:38.870 --> 07:42.030]  people. The number one question there was what is your favorite Green Dot
[07:42.030 --> 07:46.190]  concentrate? I will say it again. It is Garlic Banger. Today I went to my local
[07:46.190 --> 07:50.070]  dispensary and I did pick up a four gram jar of the Garlic Banger because I
[07:50.070 --> 07:52.430]  cannot get enough. I'm going to turn this down just a touch. I notice it
[07:52.430 --> 07:55.750]  peeking out a little bit up there on the on the camera. Hope it sounds good. Not
[07:55.750 --> 08:00.030]  going to cut myself off. But I'm going to fix that since I notice it. Also I'm
[08:00.030 --> 08:03.590]  going to make a quick disclaimer here. Green Dot does not pay me for any of
[08:03.590 --> 08:07.510]  this advertising promotion. I simply think it's a good product. I really enjoy
[08:07.510 --> 08:11.750]  it. It hits well. It tastes good. It's at the right price point for me. It gets me
[08:11.750 --> 08:14.870]  high as giraffe pussy and eagle dicks and that's what we're all after right?
[08:14.870 --> 08:18.750]  It works well for my medical and recreational needs and it fits my budget
[08:18.750 --> 08:22.990]  and it's always fucking quality. The Green Dot Black Label is one of my
[08:22.990 --> 08:27.030]  favorite products and to get even closer to narrow it down the Green Dot Black
[08:27.030 --> 08:32.790]  Label, Garlic Banger, Fortissimo, Thunderdome. What's the other one? The
[08:32.790 --> 08:36.230]  Point Break. All that shit is super delicious. I prefer the live batter.
[08:36.230 --> 08:39.510]  Sometimes I get live batter and full spectrum extract and mix them together
[08:39.510 --> 08:43.790]  and take big dabs of that nastiness. Delicious nastiness and by the way. But
[08:43.790 --> 08:47.390]  they don't pay me for it. I go buy that shit. Sometimes they do kindly invite me
[08:47.390 --> 08:51.030]  to events like this to show love for all the advertising that I do. Once again big
[08:51.030 --> 08:54.630]  up to Green Dot Labs. Big up to my friend Casey. Casey look forward to seeing you
[08:54.630 --> 08:57.790]  again bro. Everybody else at Green Dot look forward to seeing you also. All
[08:57.790 --> 09:02.270]  right where do we go from here? I've been getting one question quite often. It is
[09:02.270 --> 09:06.750]  time to address this question. A lot of people have messaged on YouTube. They've
[09:06.750 --> 09:10.550]  sent me private messages. They say hey bro what happened to the clone episode? A
[09:11.310 --> 09:14.270]  while back there was a great cloning episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[09:14.270 --> 09:19.750]  podcast on YouTube. But guess what? YouTube took that bad dog down. YouTube
[09:19.750 --> 09:24.510]  thinks that me showing you how to cut clones and propagate plants is dangerous.
[09:24.510 --> 09:28.430]  They found that to be dangerous. They took down the video. They gave my channel
[09:28.430 --> 09:32.310]  a strike. They gave me a community guideline strike and if I get too many
[09:32.310 --> 09:36.230]  of those within a certain time they will shut down the channel. So they took down
[09:36.230 --> 09:39.710]  that one and they also took down the popping and twisting and they took down
[09:39.710 --> 09:43.710]  a couple other videos all in one. It's like a big swoop a big sweep if you want
[09:43.710 --> 09:46.630]  to call it. I'm not sure what they were doing. I just felt like somebody was
[09:46.630 --> 09:49.510]  bored over at YouTube. They wanted to find something to do to look busy so
[09:49.510 --> 09:52.830]  they went and took down a couple of videos of mine just to fucking have what
[09:52.830 --> 09:56.830]  is it a quota some credit for the day. Looked like they did something. But yeah
[09:56.830 --> 10:01.390]  apparently creating smaller plants from larger plants is harmful and or
[10:01.390 --> 10:05.230]  dangerous. It's a dangerous and harmful activity. So that YouTube took that down.
[10:05.230 --> 10:08.910]  If you guys are looking for specific videos of the podcast I don't take them
[10:08.910 --> 10:12.430]  down. I work hard to make them. I like them all up there. I think it's a it's
[10:12.430 --> 10:15.750]  kind of a timeline. What is it a fucking a timeline? What's the thing when you
[10:15.750 --> 10:19.430]  bury it? A time capsule. It's a time capsule and it's also historical. It's a
[10:19.430 --> 10:23.990]  historical document. The podcast is even if I take down episodes the things I
[10:23.990 --> 10:27.550]  said the opinions I had don't disappear. That's how I felt at that time. I don't
[10:27.550 --> 10:30.390]  take them down because I work hard. I want that to be up there. It's a timeline. A
[10:30.390 --> 10:35.070]  time capsule. It's history. I'm documenting the evolution of my
[10:35.070 --> 10:38.950]  experience in cannabis. I feel like I was at the right place at the right time
[10:38.950 --> 10:42.870]  to kind of have a voice in the cannabis world. And so I'm documenting my
[10:42.870 --> 10:46.710]  experience and I don't want to edit, delete, alter or any of that. That's why
[10:46.710 --> 10:51.030]  some people that aren't even in the crew anymore. Some people that I don't talk to
[10:51.030 --> 10:54.390]  anymore. They are on old episodes of the podcast and people say wouldn't you take
[10:54.390 --> 10:58.110]  that down? I said nah bro. If I took down that episode it doesn't change the fact
[10:58.110 --> 11:01.990]  that that person came here and did that show. We were friends. We were business
[11:01.990 --> 11:05.830]  partners. We were whatever at one point. We're still the world still happens. Just
[11:05.830 --> 11:09.470]  I can't delete an episode. So my point you guys I try not to change the
[11:09.470 --> 11:12.870]  timeline. Try not to change the archive if you will. I do believe in preserving
[11:12.870 --> 11:16.750]  that archive. Kind of that's one of my roles in cannabis is to keep that that
[11:16.750 --> 11:20.270]  archive that history true and accurate. I don't like when people mix up stories
[11:20.270 --> 11:25.190]  and shit and tell myths and lies and misconceptions of cannabis and the
[11:25.190 --> 11:29.390]  history of it. So that's why I try not to delete shit. But those episodes are gone
[11:29.430 --> 11:33.590]  because YouTube. I don't take them down. That's the short version of that. All
[11:33.590 --> 11:39.070]  right now let me respond to some other things. So many haters. Oh my goodness.
[11:39.070 --> 11:42.950]  It's okay. It doesn't hurt me. It doesn't bother me. But when I talk about running
[11:42.950 --> 11:47.350]  my light schedule on 18-6 at the end of flower. I've talked about this enough. I
[11:47.350 --> 11:51.950]  shouldn't have to recap really quickly. We will. The last 10 maybe 14 days of
[11:51.950 --> 11:56.950]  flower. I put my lights back on 18 hours on and 16 hours off. It is my belief that
[11:57.070 --> 12:00.390]  light is the number one source of energy for our plants. They'll finish a little
[12:00.390 --> 12:03.430]  more quickly. They'll get a little more dense. It does have benefits. I think it
[12:03.430 --> 12:07.790]  works very well. A lot of you out there hear me say this and you are really
[12:07.790 --> 12:12.270]  quick to get up on your keyboard and just start telling me I'm an idiot. That
[12:12.270 --> 12:15.750]  I'm stupid. That I'm ruining plants. That I've never grown a plant in my life. That
[12:15.750 --> 12:19.990]  I don't know what I'm doing. Which I don't talk about things on the podcast
[12:19.990 --> 12:23.950]  unless I've done it plenty of times. I'm not going to steer people wrong. But a
[12:23.950 --> 12:26.830]  lot of haters. So many haters are sending me documents. You're sending me
[12:26.830 --> 12:30.470]  charts. You're sending me graphs. That's fucking cool. I love it. Don't stop.
[12:30.630 --> 12:35.070]  Educate me. Inform me. Update me. But also guess what you guys. I got a lot of
[12:35.070 --> 12:39.310]  supporters. People that are actually doing it. That are sending me. What is it?
[12:39.470 --> 12:43.710]  Graphs, charts, reports. And also they're sending me pictures of their plants that
[12:43.710 --> 12:47.230]  look better. They're sending me reports saying my buds were more dense. I had
[12:47.230 --> 12:50.830]  more weight. I got more product. I'm more satisfied than I ever was because I did
[12:50.830 --> 12:55.870]  the little trick that you told me. So it's only people who are not doing it
[12:55.870 --> 12:59.590]  that are unhappy with my idea. The people that have tried it have all said,
[12:59.630 --> 13:02.990]  Hey, that works, bro. And if it doesn't work for you when you try it, then guess
[13:02.990 --> 13:06.630]  what? I apologize. Not all shit works for everybody, but so far nobody has
[13:06.630 --> 13:09.910]  complained. So the only people saying it doesn't work. And the only people
[13:09.910 --> 13:13.270]  telling me that I'm crazy are the people that haven't tried it. The people doing
[13:13.270 --> 13:17.430]  it. They seem to be liking it. So it doesn't matter to me what light schedule
[13:17.430 --> 13:20.190]  you run. It really doesn't. As long as you're happy with the way that the
[13:20.190 --> 13:22.670]  plants come out, it shouldn't bother you so much that I'm doing something
[13:22.670 --> 13:26.830]  differently. It seems to be working for a lot of people. Try it, try it, then
[13:26.830 --> 13:30.150]  bash me. If you try it and fucking hate it, then send me some hate mail, but
[13:30.150 --> 13:34.350]  don't, don't just send me hate mail because you think it is fun. Uh, but my,
[13:34.350 --> 13:37.550]  my, one of my points here is don't, don't be afraid to try new shit. You can
[13:37.550 --> 13:40.990]  call me crazy if you want to, but don't be afraid to try some new things. How do
[13:40.990 --> 13:44.070]  you know if it's going to work? How do you know if it's not? One of my favorite
[13:44.070 --> 13:47.710]  things about growing cannabis is that there's no one way of doing this. We're
[13:47.710 --> 13:51.830]  all doing this differently. I learned how to do this kind of before we had a lot
[13:51.830 --> 13:54.710]  of resources on the internet. I was doing this in different places where he
[13:54.710 --> 13:58.470]  had to, we had to be real quiet, real careful about it. So I was learning how
[13:58.470 --> 14:02.390]  to do this way back in the day. I was doing it way differently than the guy
[14:02.390 --> 14:05.390]  down the street doing it, than the other guy doing it, than all the other guys
[14:05.390 --> 14:09.150]  doing it. We're all doing it our own way. It's like music. We're going to do it a
[14:09.150 --> 14:11.830]  little bit differently. We're going to use different gear, different schedules,
[14:11.830 --> 14:15.030]  different ideas, definitely different genetics, different nutrients, but guess
[14:15.030 --> 14:18.110]  what? We're all going to make music. We're all going to make really delicious
[14:18.110 --> 14:23.030]  buds in the end. There's no one way to grow a ganja plant. If you have quality
[14:23.030 --> 14:26.390]  buds that aren't contaminated by some mold or pesticide at the end that you're
[14:26.390 --> 14:30.110]  cool with smoking, that the people in your circle, whether it's your patients,
[14:30.110 --> 14:34.190]  your friends, maybe it's your clientele, maybe it's your family, whoever smoking
[14:34.190 --> 14:37.430]  it, if they're happy with it, you're doing it right. You're not doing it wrong. We
[14:37.430 --> 14:43.630]  all have the same goal. So let's all be on the same team. Recently I accidentally
[14:43.630 --> 14:48.350]  got involved in a debate about drying and curing temperature and humidity.
[14:48.350 --> 14:51.310]  Somebody thinks, a friend of mine, bro, you're going to hear this. You're my
[14:51.310 --> 14:54.710]  friend. We disagree. And guess what? Still love you, bro. I'll fucking sit next to
[14:54.710 --> 14:57.630]  you and smoke a bowl with you. We'll talk about something different. I won't even
[14:57.630 --> 15:01.390]  care that we disagree. Who cares that we disagree? We do shit different. My point
[15:01.390 --> 15:04.670]  is I'm involved in a conversation about drying and curing. It's an argument. It's
[15:04.670 --> 15:08.990]  an ongoing argument between multiple people. I didn't make it an argument. I'm
[15:08.990 --> 15:12.750]  saying here's my opinion. That's fucking what I do. I don't, I'm not saying I don't
[15:12.750 --> 15:16.510]  care what you do, but it doesn't matter to me what happens in other people's
[15:16.510 --> 15:20.350]  garden. I hope you have success. I hope you do really well. It's none of my
[15:20.350 --> 15:23.030]  business what you're doing in there unless you ask for my help or you need
[15:23.030 --> 15:25.590]  some guidance. I shouldn't even be peeking in there. I shouldn't have an
[15:25.590 --> 15:29.350]  opinion. So my friend that dries and cures differently than me, bro, do you
[15:29.350 --> 15:32.790]  think, pimpin', dry and cure differently than me? As long as your weed comes out
[15:32.790 --> 15:37.710]  good, I don't care if it's different. As long as it's correct. My main guideline,
[15:37.710 --> 15:41.350]  the things I do care about is, is there mold in there? Is there a pesticide
[15:41.350 --> 15:45.710]  contamination in there? Is it funky? You know, if there's mold pesticides or if
[15:45.710 --> 15:49.470]  it's funky, do we want to smoke it? You've got ethics. I've got ethics. If
[15:49.470 --> 15:52.590]  it's cool, I don't care how it's dried and cured. If it longs, as long as it
[15:52.590 --> 15:57.350]  comes out trimmed, dried, cured and dank weed, I don't care how you did it. So my
[15:57.350 --> 16:01.870]  point here is let's learn together. My friend has a completely different idea
[16:01.870 --> 16:06.350]  of how to dry and cure weed than I do, but he grows great weed. We both grow top
[16:06.350 --> 16:10.110]  quality weed. I would smoke his weed. He would smoke my weed. We would argue for a
[16:10.110 --> 16:13.190]  minute about drying, curing. Guess what? I'll high five him, give him a hug, pack
[16:13.190 --> 16:16.990]  him up a fat bong rip, pass him a dab. He'd do the same for me. If I drank beer,
[16:16.990 --> 16:20.350]  I'm sure we'd crack open a beer together and do that. That's not my thing. But bro,
[16:20.350 --> 16:23.550]  you know who you are. Everybody in the community that was in that conversation,
[16:23.550 --> 16:27.150]  we know who we are. I'm not mad at you, but I love all you guys. If it has
[16:27.150 --> 16:30.230]  anything to do, if we're doing things different, that's great. That may inspire
[16:30.230 --> 16:33.870]  me. That may educate me. That may inspire, spark me to do things differently and
[16:33.870 --> 16:37.870]  learn some different shit. We're all on the same team here. We've all got the
[16:37.870 --> 16:40.590]  same goal. So before you go jumping down someone's throat because they grow
[16:40.590 --> 16:44.510]  weed differently than you, maybe just realize we're on the same team. We've
[16:44.510 --> 16:48.550]  got the same goal. Let's not fight about it. Let's teach each other. Also be open
[16:48.550 --> 16:51.830]  to learn something. Be open to teach something. It goes both directions.
[16:52.950 --> 16:56.390]  All right. After a brief distraction, I am back. Ladies and gentlemen, keep the
[16:56.390 --> 17:00.350]  conversation going in the comments. Keep the emails coming. The email address is
[17:00.350 --> 17:05.270]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Don't be shy. Also, the Grow Help tab on the
[17:05.270 --> 17:09.670]  website is now corrected. I did notice that the emails from the Grow Help tab
[17:09.670 --> 17:14.030]  were not being forwarded to my email inbox. That has been corrected. If you
[17:14.030 --> 17:17.310]  have asked a Grow question on the Grow Help tab recently and I have not
[17:17.310 --> 17:21.110]  responded to you or answered that question on the show, please do resend
[17:21.110 --> 17:24.990]  that question once again on the updated Grow Help tab. You'll find that at
[17:24.990 --> 17:29.630]  iRegenetics.com. There's a tab on the top that says Grow Help. Simply click on
[17:29.630 --> 17:33.150]  there. That will give you the Grow Help tab, ask you a few questions. That will
[17:33.150 --> 17:37.390]  send your message directly to my inbox. I will now. Before it was not, something
[17:37.390 --> 17:41.070]  got broken in the chain there. But now it will send that to my inbox. Big shout
[17:41.070 --> 17:44.630]  out to the web guy for fixing that. Thank you, bro. But please do send those
[17:44.630 --> 17:48.550]  messages to the Grow Help tab. I will get your Grow Help questions here on the
[17:48.550 --> 17:52.630]  podcast. Help me to build listener-generated content.
[17:53.070 --> 17:55.990]  All right. I do have more to talk about. Another common question I've been
[17:55.990 --> 18:01.230]  getting lately involving that 18-6 light cycle is, do I change the light intensity
[18:01.230 --> 18:06.030]  when I switch my lights from 12-12 to 18-6? Do I change the intensity of the
[18:06.030 --> 18:10.750]  bulbs at all? My answer is no. I've been spinning the entire flowering cycle
[18:10.750 --> 18:14.910]  ramping up from one point in my light game all the way up to the maximum light
[18:14.910 --> 18:19.950]  of my lights or the maximum potential of my lights. I let them go. They ride for a
[18:19.950 --> 18:24.030]  couple of weeks at full potential. Then I put them back on 18-6. I don't want to
[18:24.030 --> 18:28.670]  reduce the intensity in my room. I keep it the same. Your room may need reduction
[18:28.670 --> 18:31.870]  if you've got LEDs and you've gone all the way up and you're close to cooking
[18:31.870 --> 18:35.230]  them. Pay attention to the leaves. Pay attention to the plants. This is called
[18:35.230 --> 18:38.990]  the DLI, the daily light integral. The plants are going to look a little bit
[18:38.990 --> 18:42.950]  confused and frustrated, but I do not dial back the intensity. If the leaves
[18:42.950 --> 18:47.630]  start looking crispy or burnt, you may need to dial it back. I do not do that. I
[18:47.630 --> 18:53.150]  usually start when I go into flower. My LEDs are usually around 50-60% of their
[18:53.150 --> 18:58.030]  power. Then I slowly increase them. And by week 7, 8, or 9, I'm generally up to
[18:58.030 --> 19:05.070]  100% power. My LEDs don't have a real clear percentage dial on them. You put a
[19:05.070 --> 19:08.990]  screwdriver and turn a screw and it turns all the way this way is approximately
[19:08.990 --> 19:14.270]  50%. All the way this way is 100%. I start here when they go into flower and I
[19:14.270 --> 19:18.270]  slowly crank them up. I nudge them just a little bit every week, just a little bit
[19:18.270 --> 19:21.830]  of a percent. I can't tell you precisely how much it is, honestly, but I know I
[19:21.830 --> 19:26.790]  start at 50 and then I do end up at 100%. I do not turn that intensity down once I
[19:26.790 --> 19:30.830]  get it there. Now if I'm using a high-pressure sodium lamp in this room,
[19:30.830 --> 19:34.390]  which sometimes I do because in the winter it gets really cold and the LED
[19:34.390 --> 19:38.030]  doesn't keep the room warm, so I just use a high-pressure sodium bulb to keep the
[19:38.030 --> 19:41.950]  room warm and spread some light around. If I'm using the high-pressure sodium, I
[19:41.950 --> 19:46.270]  simply lower that light or raise that light to adjust the intensity. Most of
[19:46.270 --> 19:49.590]  the time it just stays in the one spot. I don't move it after I've done the change.
[19:49.590 --> 19:53.830]  LEDs, you do have to keep them kind of far from the canopy still. So if your
[19:53.830 --> 19:56.950]  plants have grown up real tall and flowered into the lighting, then you may
[19:56.950 --> 20:00.950]  need to do some height adjustments or possibly some intensity adjustments
[20:00.950 --> 20:04.150]  accordingly. I do plan ahead for that sort of stuff so I don't have to cut
[20:04.150 --> 20:09.030]  back intensity at all when it comes to that 18-6 flowering cycle toward the end.
[20:09.030 --> 20:13.710]  So in my space, in my grow, in my application, I do not reduce the light
[20:13.710 --> 20:17.750]  intensity. I do not raise it. I do not lower it. I simply plan ahead and know
[20:17.750 --> 20:21.630]  what to expect. I allow that extra space between the bulbs and between my lights
[20:21.750 --> 20:25.750]  and I slowly ramp it up. You guys, you should be, in my opinion, from what I've
[20:25.750 --> 20:29.110]  learned with LED lighting is we should not be just putting the plants under
[20:29.110 --> 20:32.070]  there at full intensity. If you've got a good strong quality light, if you've got
[20:32.070 --> 20:36.150]  a low intensity, low output LED light that's not putting out a whole bunch of
[20:36.150 --> 20:39.550]  spectrum, a whole bunch of light, maybe you can crank that bitch up. But when the
[20:39.550 --> 20:42.270]  plants are little, they don't need all that LED lighting. From what I've learned,
[20:42.270 --> 20:46.070]  get the plant or the light at the right height, dial it down low and as the plant
[20:46.070 --> 20:49.670]  grows, slowly increase that. Save some boosting for when it goes into flower.
[20:50.190 --> 20:54.150]  You want to add some lumen, add some intensity when it does go into flower. So
[20:54.150 --> 20:58.470]  slowly increase them from veg as they grow, as they grow into flower, increase
[20:58.470 --> 21:03.070]  it a little more so that around week 7, 8 or 9, then you finally reach your full
[21:03.070 --> 21:07.270]  potential. Some people go at week 6, some go later. That is up to you and your
[21:07.270 --> 21:10.230]  light, but it's easier if you ramp it up just a little bit. You'll notice the
[21:10.230 --> 21:13.910]  plants do perform a little bit better. All right, we're gonna talk about one
[21:13.910 --> 21:17.350]  more thing before we start wrapping up this episode. Another question that I do
[21:17.510 --> 21:21.070]  get quite often, this is a good question, this is a fun one, it's an easy one to
[21:21.070 --> 21:26.110]  answer. People often ask me, hey, Rasta Jeff, what are table seeds? If you buy
[21:26.110 --> 21:29.630]  seeds from iRedirect or if you've gotten seeds from me in the past, there's a
[21:29.630 --> 21:34.270]  good chance that you've received table seeds as a freebie, as a gift. Table
[21:34.270 --> 21:41.030]  seeds are simply table seeds. When I make packages, I will get my amount of
[21:41.030 --> 21:44.790]  seeds. Maybe I'll have an amount of, I'm just gonna say random strains. Maybe
[21:44.830 --> 21:49.270]  there's Strawberry Starburst, maybe there's Moontower, maybe there's Jack
[21:49.270 --> 21:52.950]  Tripper seeds that I'm packaging up today. So I'll get my packaging supplies,
[21:52.950 --> 21:55.910]  I'll get my seeds, I'll get my light, I'll get my little setup and I'll package
[21:55.910 --> 21:59.270]  up a bunch of seeds. I'll go through the Strawberry Starburst, I'll go through the
[21:59.270 --> 22:02.550]  Moontower, I'll go through the whatever other strain that I said, I'll package up
[22:02.550 --> 22:06.150]  however many packages I'm aiming to do. I'll clean up and then I notice that
[22:06.150 --> 22:09.790]  sometimes, maybe over here under the iPad stand, there's a couple of seeds and
[22:09.790 --> 22:12.630]  over here by the recording device, there's a couple of seeds that just
[22:12.630 --> 22:15.990]  rolled away or there's a seed over here by my phone that just got away and I'm
[22:15.990 --> 22:19.910]  not sure what it is. I can't sell you those seeds in a package because I can't
[22:19.910 --> 22:23.550]  guarantee which batch of seeds they came from. They could have been anything that
[22:23.550 --> 22:27.350]  I worked on today or maybe something from a couple of days ago that I didn't
[22:27.350 --> 22:30.790]  even see on the table. I didn't clean up well enough and I found seeds that are
[22:30.790 --> 22:35.790]  just sitting there. So those table seeds are random seeds from my inventory that
[22:35.790 --> 22:39.830]  could be anything from my lineup. They could be regular, they could be
[22:39.830 --> 22:43.670]  feminized, they could be testers, they could be unreleased beans that I was
[22:43.670 --> 22:47.270]  counting for myself and one got away. It could have been something I was sharing
[22:47.270 --> 22:52.030]  with a friend and one rolled off to the side. My table seeds could be anything.
[22:52.030 --> 22:55.910]  We do like to post the table seeds to the Discord. If you are on the Discord,
[22:55.910 --> 22:59.430]  find the table seed section, post the pictures in there. We have a lot of fun
[22:59.430 --> 23:03.630]  guessing and speculating what they could be but honestly, they could be anything
[23:03.630 --> 23:08.430]  from my vault. Old stuff, new stuff, future stuff. It could be shit that's not even
[23:08.430 --> 23:12.510]  thought of or released that you know of yet. It could be stuff I'm keeping secret.
[23:12.510 --> 23:15.710]  Maybe I was breaking off seeds to send to one of my favorite friends who's
[23:15.710 --> 23:18.990]  gonna test them. Maybe I was giving Dave's Not Here some seeds and I just
[23:18.990 --> 23:22.310]  accidentally spilled a couple. Who knows what it could be. So they could be
[23:22.310 --> 23:27.190]  anything from the iReed Genetics lineup. If you get table seeds, I encourage you
[23:27.190 --> 23:30.150]  to grow them. Those are gifts, they are freebies. I don't charge anything for
[23:30.150 --> 23:33.870]  those. I don't ask anything for those. They just come in your box randomly. So
[23:33.870 --> 23:37.750]  if you get those, grow them. If you have a winner or a gem, send me some pictures.
[23:37.750 --> 23:42.030]  Let me know what it smells like, how it grew, how it acted. Maybe just for fun, we
[23:42.030 --> 23:46.350]  can try to identify your table seeds. Alright, that is what table seeds are.
[23:46.350 --> 23:49.990]  That is this episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Ladies and gentlemen,
[23:49.990 --> 23:54.310]  boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen
