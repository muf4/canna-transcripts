[00:18.620 --> 00:23.000]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 201 of the
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.820]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:26.820 --> 00:30.500]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:30.500 --> 00:33.960]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:33.960 --> 00:36.820]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:36.820 --> 00:42.060]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call
[00:42.060 --> 00:45.740]  me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I want to
[00:45.740 --> 00:48.700]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:48.700 --> 00:52.940]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
[00:52.940 --> 00:58.660]  Mystic Roots crew. I also want to send a shout out to the new member of the
[00:58.660 --> 01:02.260]  Mystic Roots family. Big shout out to Little Lake, Little Lake Mystic Roots.
[01:02.260 --> 01:05.900]  Cute little kid you guys got there. Good work Kat and Ku. I'm proud of you. The
[01:05.900 --> 01:09.140]  baby looks super healthy and is super adorable. I knew that kid was gonna be
[01:09.140 --> 01:14.060]  cute. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize if you can hear it in my voice. I've got a
[01:14.060 --> 01:17.220]  little bit of a little bit of a sniffle, a little bit of a sore throat thing
[01:17.220 --> 01:21.140]  happening, a sinus thing going on. I might just be a little bit dehydrated. I may
[01:21.140 --> 01:24.700]  have taken too many dabs over the 420 celebration. I may have overindulged. I
[01:24.700 --> 01:28.340]  may have dehydrated myself and not drank enough water. So my message to you is
[01:28.340 --> 01:32.860]  drink some water and take some vitamins because I did not do that and I could
[01:32.860 --> 01:35.580]  tell. I could feel it on my chest and throat. I apologize if my throat and my
[01:35.580 --> 01:40.700]  voice sound like shit on this podcast but we will survive. So like I said, this
[01:40.700 --> 01:43.780]  is the post 420 episode. I hope everybody had a good 420. Hope everybody
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.300]  stayed safe. I hope nobody did anything stupid. Hope nobody got themselves in any
[01:47.300 --> 01:50.940]  sort of trouble. Let me know what you did for 420. I want to hear about it. Tweet me
[01:50.940 --> 01:54.500]  at GFYHpodcast or you can send me an email. It's growfromyourheart at
[01:54.500 --> 01:59.860]  hotmail.com. I want to know what you did for 420. Alright, I've got a correction
[01:59.860 --> 02:02.500]  to make. I've been saying that this podcast has been going for two years. A
[02:02.500 --> 02:05.840]  couple of people have informed me that they think the podcast has been going
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.340]  for closer to three years. Shout out to my friend Bag Seed Jesse and of course
[02:10.460 --> 02:14.060]  White Mike. They both pointed out that the show has been going for approximately
[02:14.060 --> 02:17.260]  three years now. I'm even more proud than I was when I thought it was two years.
[02:17.260 --> 02:22.020]  I'm 365 days more proud. It's fucking awesome. Thank you guys for listening to
[02:22.020 --> 02:26.420]  201 episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I've been putting out those old
[02:26.420 --> 02:30.260]  episodes of what used to be the iGrow Culture podcast and I hope you guys are
[02:30.260 --> 02:34.060]  enjoying it. I did not do one for the 420 week. I just put out a 420 episode.
[02:34.060 --> 02:37.380]  Kind of took a little break. I hope you guys missed those long episodes. I'll do
[02:37.380 --> 02:40.740]  my best to get one out for you this week when I get done with this episode.
[02:40.740 --> 02:44.580]  I will put it together for you. I can already feel my voice burning out a
[02:44.580 --> 02:48.020]  little bit so this may be a short episode you guys but I promise I'll do
[02:48.020 --> 02:52.100]  the best I can with what I've got. I want to apologize that my website looks like
[02:52.100 --> 02:57.060]  shit at the end of every episode or actually when I tweet the episodes out
[02:57.060 --> 02:59.700]  when a new episode comes out I like to send it out on Twitter and say hey look
[02:59.700 --> 03:02.960]  there's a new episode. I always like to say hey you can check out the podcast on
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.240]  iTunes on Stitcher and also my website I read genetics colorado.com. I went to
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.320]  I read genetics colorado.com the other day and I realized it looks like a piece
[03:11.320 --> 03:15.280]  of shit website that needs some love it needs some updating. I apologize my web
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.880]  guy has been distracted. I don't really put much effort or energy into that
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.000]  website so it's there it's gonna get fixed eventually but it does look like
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.400]  shit it's embarrassing I'm acknowledging that it needs love and I'm also admitting
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.160]  that it looks like shit and I know it I'm not proud of it so please don't
[03:30.160 --> 03:32.680]  judge me on that. Now you guys are gonna go there and fucking look at it but
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.480]  you're right it does look like shit I'm sorry that sucks. So I have got a few
[03:37.480 --> 03:40.600]  let's see we want to do the comments first or do we want to talk about
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.600]  replies let's talk about these replies. On the last episode I asked what you
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.240]  guys were smoking for 420. My friend Big John said he was smoking Chernobyl
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.200]  crumble. That sounds delicious. Chernobyl is a great strain it's always super
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.120]  frosty I like the flavor of it. I really enjoy the the slimer cut of Chernobyl. So
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.660]  Big John is smoking Chernobyl crumble dabs. Are you smoking that through a rig?
[04:02.660 --> 04:05.460]  Or are you smoking it on top of flowers? I want to know how you're doing that bro.
[04:05.460 --> 04:09.380]  Shout out to Big John I hope those shirts look good on you. Also my friend
[04:09.380 --> 04:13.020]  Astro Hayes. Oh man I was supposed to find a screenshot from you. I've got a
[04:13.020 --> 04:15.780]  screenshot here my phone I took a picture of it. I'm gonna search through the phone
[04:15.780 --> 04:18.380]  real quick I can find the screenshot really quick actually the iPhone has a
[04:18.380 --> 04:22.220]  thing that says screenshots. I've got a message from Astro Hayes that I want to
[04:22.220 --> 04:26.620]  read. I've got a lot of messages I have to go through super quickly here to find
[04:26.620 --> 04:31.540]  it. Man I'm kind of fucking up this part of the podcast huh? I might have to hit
[04:31.540 --> 04:38.100]  pause or something. This is very unprofessional feeling. Oh is this
[04:38.100 --> 04:56.240]  Astro Hayes? Alright I found it. I suck at podcasting sometimes I apologize for
[04:56.240 --> 05:00.680]  that long shitty moment of silence there but I did find it I had so much stuff in
[05:00.680 --> 05:04.200]  my phone you guys. So my friend Astro Hayes he sent me a message it says hey
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.040]  man love listening to the last podcast which I just started listening always
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.200]  love to know what peeps are digging on when smoking. You're like me back in the
[05:11.200 --> 05:14.680]  day I was a wrestler and used to listen to a lot of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Rush
[05:14.680 --> 05:19.160]  etc. Before getting into the dead I've seen them over 60 plus times with Garcia
[05:19.160 --> 05:23.040]  all over the country. I still listen by the way it's a daily ritual. Also love
[05:23.040 --> 05:26.920]  Panic and Moe. I'll actually be out in Denver for the three Panic shows in June
[05:26.920 --> 05:31.680]  pretty pumped. Peace and have a great day. Astro Hayes from Wisconsin. Astro Hayes
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.960]  we do have a lot of musical tastes in common. Much respect. You've seen the dead
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.560]  over 60 times with Jerry. I salute you my friend. I hate to say it I never got
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.160]  to see Jerry. I've seen so many incarnations of the Grateful Dead but I
[05:45.160 --> 05:49.800]  never got to see Jerry play on a stage. Bob wore a spit on me during Throwing
[05:49.800 --> 05:53.400]  Stones at a show at the Paramount Theatre one year the day before Halloween. I
[05:53.400 --> 05:58.240]  forget what year it was like 96 maybe ish maybe 97 it was a long freaking time
[05:58.240 --> 06:03.260]  ago. Rat Dog did a couple nights at the Paramount Theatre in Denver they did
[06:03.260 --> 06:06.900]  Halloween and I went to the night before Halloween that was the night that
[06:06.900 --> 06:11.020]  the spit landed on my face. I was front row it was fucking awesome but never saw
[06:11.020 --> 06:15.180]  Jerry. You're coming to see Panic this summer. I don't know that I'll go see
[06:15.180 --> 06:19.540]  Panic. I'm not huge into Panic like I used to be at all. Without Mikey and with
[06:19.540 --> 06:24.180]  all the changes I lost interest in Panic. I saw Panic that that's one thing I
[06:24.180 --> 06:27.460]  can't say I saw widespread Panic when Michael Hauser was still in the band. I
[06:27.460 --> 06:31.500]  shook Michael Hauser's hand. I was on Panic tour. I was on the tour when
[06:31.500 --> 06:35.460]  Michael quit actually when he resigned and stepped down and let George McConnell
[06:35.460 --> 06:38.980]  take over for him. I was on tour with Panic at that time so I got to see a lot
[06:38.980 --> 06:42.500]  of Panic shows. I saw Mikey's last show. I got to go to the Red Rock shows right
[06:42.500 --> 06:46.260]  after Michael Hauser passed away. So I was a huge Panic fan I just kind of lost
[06:46.260 --> 06:50.180]  interest. Mo is fucking awesome. Mo is always gonna be one of my favorite bands.
[06:50.180 --> 06:53.180]  If I'm on a road trip if I'm driving and I'm getting tired and I need to wake up
[06:53.180 --> 06:58.620]  put on some Mo. Plane Crash, 32 Things, anything in that realm. Some Rebubula,
[06:58.660 --> 07:03.420]  some Buster. I like that old-school Mo stuff. The really old stuff tin cans and
[07:03.420 --> 07:07.580]  car tires maybe even older stuff than that. But I've seen a lot of Mo shows. I
[07:07.580 --> 07:12.140]  used to wear light up devil horns to Mo shows and when Chucky would see me he
[07:12.140 --> 07:15.420]  would give me the devil horns with his hand. He'd be like what's up bro and he'd always
[07:15.420 --> 07:19.200]  give me the devil's. Yeah I was a huge I'm a huge Mo fan. Me and my buddy Rob
[07:19.200 --> 07:21.700]  the Dude used to go see a bunch of Mo shows. Rob I don't know if you listen to
[07:21.700 --> 07:25.860]  the podcast you fucking better bro. Shout out to Rob the Dude. Rob the Dude was my
[07:26.620 --> 07:30.460]  road dog for so many shows. We've seen so many Phish shows, widespread panic shows,
[07:30.460 --> 07:36.020]  Mo. We've seen a ton of shows together. Man I got really ranty when we started
[07:36.020 --> 07:39.140]  talking about music. Music's one of my favorite things. Listening to the
[07:39.140 --> 07:42.340]  Grateful Dead is sort of a daily ritual for myself as well. I listen to a lot of
[07:42.340 --> 07:46.020]  Grateful Dead. I've got the Sirius XM in the car so I got the Grateful Dead radio.
[07:46.020 --> 07:49.900]  As soon as I turn on the car Jerry comes on and starts singing. Can't get much
[07:49.900 --> 07:54.420]  better than that. I used to listen to a lot of Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Rush. I
[07:54.420 --> 08:00.300]  listen to a lot. I don't listen. I listened to a lot of Metallica. Lars is
[08:00.300 --> 08:05.540]  who I'm a drummer. I've played the drums since I was 14 years old. I played the
[08:05.540 --> 08:08.860]  desk at school. I played the buckets wherever I was. I played the fucking
[08:08.860 --> 08:12.780]  walls. I played the tables. I played whatever made noise probably from when
[08:12.780 --> 08:16.740]  I was like 7 years old until now. But I've been a drummer. I was born to be a
[08:16.740 --> 08:20.180]  drummer and Lars is kind of what triggered that. Now I know Lars is kind
[08:20.180 --> 08:24.140]  of a shitty drummer. I know that but he's still that's what started it all. I
[08:24.180 --> 08:26.460]  didn't know that he was terrible when I was 12 years old and thinking that he
[08:26.460 --> 08:29.860]  was the coolest shit in the world. Here's a cool weed related story. This
[08:29.860 --> 08:32.900]  is a good segue to make this weed related. Part of how I became a
[08:32.900 --> 08:37.060]  drummer. I have two uncles who are really cool guys. Shout out Ron and Eric. I have
[08:37.060 --> 08:39.980]  another uncle also but he wasn't in this story. Troy, love you too man. Love all
[08:39.980 --> 08:43.700]  three of my uncles. Cool fucking dudes. They are part of why I am who I am. I've
[08:43.700 --> 08:47.620]  got traits of all of them in me. They kind of helped raise me. So shout out to
[08:47.620 --> 08:52.020]  all my uncles. Fucking love you guys. But anyway Ron and Eric took me to my first
[08:52.020 --> 08:55.740]  real concert when I was young. I was probably 14 years old I'm gonna guess.
[08:55.740 --> 08:58.900]  And then you know what I was in California and I left California when I
[08:58.900 --> 09:02.900]  was 14 so I had to be 13 or 14 years old. Not much. I couldn't have been any older
[09:02.900 --> 09:08.140]  than that. So they take me to a concert. The bands were Jackal and the Damn
[09:08.140 --> 09:12.260]  Yankees. I know not the best bands ever but Jackal was fucking cool and the Damn
[09:12.260 --> 09:15.620]  Yankees they could play music whatever. Back in the day I was going to a concert.
[09:15.620 --> 09:17.880]  I didn't care. I was gonna go have some fun and see some boobs and hear some
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.200]  loud music. It was fucking epic. It was at the Long Beach Arena I think or the
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.840]  LA Sports Arena. Somewhere in LA or Long Beach in California. It was a small kind of a
[09:27.840 --> 09:30.840]  large place but they divided it in half by putting up a giant curtain so it
[09:30.840 --> 09:34.080]  could be a smaller venue for these not A-level bands to play. But on the way
[09:34.080 --> 09:38.760]  there my uncle had a Chevy El Camino so it's got seats up front but then in the
[09:38.760 --> 09:41.400]  back it's kind of like a truck bed but he had a camper shell on it. It was all
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.120]  carpeted and he had some speakers back there. And the Black Album from Metallica
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.400]  had just come out. So whatever year that was that's when this happened. And he
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.840]  played the Black Album from Metallica all the way to the concert and my two
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.240]  uncles in the front of the car smoked a fat joint during the drive. And I'm
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.800]  pretty sure I got pretty stoned. I'd smoked... I don't know that I'd smoked. Yeah
[10:03.800 --> 10:07.160]  I'd smoked a couple times with my buddy Chris and stuff by then but I wasn't
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.360]  really smoking a lot. So I got a nice contact high from their their joint in
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.680]  the front of the car. We got nice and stoned and went and saw Metallica. So yeah
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.160]  that's that's a good weed related. But that's part of what that trip in the car
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.800]  me in the back of that Chevy El Camino getting stoned off my uncle's weed
[10:22.800 --> 10:26.960]  listening to Sad But True is where something inside of me said I'm a
[10:26.960 --> 10:30.640]  fucking drummer. I am going to play the drums. And from then on all I did was
[10:30.640 --> 10:33.120]  walk around and air drum on everything and look like I was having a problem.
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.840]  Just air drumming everywhere doing big drum fills in the air all the time. Play
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.720]  the steering wheel, play the car seat, play it all man. But anyway that's part
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.000]  how I got addicted to the drums and it's cannabis related. I was never really
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.200]  into Iron Maiden. Doesn't really do it much for me. Not my thing. But all the
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.560]  other stuff you listen to bro I think we could totally link up on. So Astro Hayes
[10:52.560 --> 10:55.760]  from Wisconsin. Shout out for the email. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.520]  rant about music. Music's one of my favorite things ever. I want to know is
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.640]  Astro Hayes a White Zombie reference? I know White Zombie was an Astro creep. He
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.000]  has a lot of Astro Hayes sort of references in his music. Curious if
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.400]  that's where that came from. Maybe I'm missing something else. Anyway thanks for
[11:11.400 --> 11:14.880]  the long email. Thanks for the opportunity to talk about music. What
[11:14.880 --> 11:18.480]  else do I have on this list? Barry O. Barry O is a longtime podcast listener.
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.720]  He's been listening to the show since the beginning. Thanks for hanging out
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.960]  with us dude. Barry O says he listens to The People Under the Stairs and Most
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.440]  Death. Which honestly I know who Most Death is. Could not name a single fucking
[11:31.440 --> 11:35.640]  song. I'm pretty sure... I'm gonna sound racist because I'm fucking ignorant. I'm
[11:35.640 --> 11:38.240]  pretty sure that was Most Death in the car with Dave Chappelle and they're driving
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.480]  around rapping. It was fucking dope if that's who that was. If that's not who
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.960]  that was I'm fucking racist. I'll accept that. I apologize. I'm not trying to be a
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.160]  racist guy here. I just don't know who the fuck all the rappers are. I can't
[11:49.160 --> 11:53.040]  keep up. I had to drive around and listen to Kendrick Lamar this weekend with my
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.720]  daughter. She got the new Kendrick Lamar on her phone. That was
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.200]  interesting. That is not my favorite kind of music. But when your kid's in the car
[12:01.200 --> 12:03.800]  you just let her listen to whatever she wants to because she's fucking cooler
[12:03.800 --> 12:06.720]  than you guys and she wins anyway. Alright I am super rambly today you guys
[12:06.720 --> 12:10.200]  if you can't tell. I've got this little head cold thing and I took a bunch of
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.200]  dabs and it just made my brain fly out of my head. So I'm not all focused but
[12:14.200 --> 12:17.400]  who the fuck needs to be focused for a podcast right? This is a cannabis podcast.
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.480]  We need to be a little bit off the rails today. I see something happening in the
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.640]  recording software that I need to make a note of around 12 minutes and 20 seconds.
[12:25.640 --> 12:28.680]  I'm just gonna have to fix something. It's cool. You guys will never notice
[12:28.680 --> 12:31.840]  because I will have fixed it by the time this goes out. I think this is gonna be
[12:31.840 --> 12:35.800]  straight what we call live to drive in the recording industry. I'm just gonna
[12:35.800 --> 12:39.080]  record it put it out. Probably won't even edit this. It's gonna be a great
[12:39.080 --> 12:41.640]  show you guys get to feel the vibe feel like you're hanging out with me. Makes it
[12:41.640 --> 12:46.520]  easier. Alright what I want to do now I've talked about I apologize for my
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.360]  website sucking. I corrected the three years. I told you I got a little bit of
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.240]  cold. Told you what my friends are listening to. Now I think we should read
[12:54.240 --> 12:57.200]  some iTunes comments. I try to read the iTunes comments about once a month.
[12:57.200 --> 13:01.160]  People have been pouring in more iTunes comments. It feels like the more I read
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.360]  them the more people send them so that's awesome. So let's start just reading them
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.800]  instead of rambling about it. If you guys want to send a comment on iTunes all
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.600]  you have to do is go to iTunes. Go to the iTunes store. On the top right type in
[13:12.600 --> 13:15.320]  Grow From Your Heart. It'll bring up a little logo with the Grow From Your
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.720]  Heart podcast. Click on that. There will be a little section that says the Grow
[13:19.720 --> 13:22.480]  From Your Heart podcast hosted by Ross and Jeff of iRead Genetics. There'll be a
[13:22.480 --> 13:26.040]  little spot that says details, ratings and reviews and related. All you got to
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.040]  do is click on ratings and reviews and there's a little part where it says
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.160]  write a review. You can type in whatever you'd like. However you feel about the
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.160]  show let me know and I will read your review on a future episode. So far
[13:36.160 --> 13:39.440]  everybody has given me a five star review. You give me as many stars as you
[13:39.440 --> 13:44.000]  feel I deserve and I will appreciate it. I will take it. Alright this first
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  comment that I'm going to read was left on April 22nd by my friend Rachel Lynn
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.320]  and it says congratulation... no it actually says congratulations. That's a
[13:53.320 --> 13:56.840]  big word. Congratulations Jeff on your 200th episode. I remember being back in
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.340]  North Carolina listening to your podcast in the apartment while we were packing
[14:00.340 --> 14:04.700]  up for Colorado and now while I'm while I trim at work. I look forward to an
[14:04.700 --> 14:08.020]  episode each week and I thank you for all the shout outs to Will and Barefoot
[14:08.020 --> 14:12.540]  Extracts. It warms my heart. I hope you had an awesome 420. Thank you for
[14:12.540 --> 14:16.940]  everything you do for the cannabis community. Rachel thank you for the huge
[14:16.940 --> 14:21.260]  support on iTunes here. If you couldn't tell by the review you guys Rachel is
[14:21.260 --> 14:26.100]  the Barefoot Extracts. That's his lovely fiancee, soon-to-be wife. Congratulations
[14:26.100 --> 14:31.500]  on that you guys. She was in North Carolina. That's where Will... oh my
[14:31.500 --> 14:33.740]  something just went fucking weird. I don't know if that happened in the
[14:33.740 --> 14:38.060]  software. Let's check and see. I hope you guys didn't hear that but in my
[14:38.060 --> 14:42.020]  headphones it just went really wonky. That might be my whole not editing thing
[14:42.020 --> 14:46.780]  going to shit right there. Alright I fixed the problem. I know what it is. It's
[14:46.780 --> 14:50.460]  been identified and corrected. Let's get back to this review. Rachel is... where was
[14:50.460 --> 14:54.380]  I? Rachel is Will's fiancee. She used to... they used to live in North Carolina. Before
[14:54.380 --> 14:58.340]  they came to Colorado they were out in North Carolina and she was packing up
[14:58.340 --> 15:01.500]  the apartment listening to the podcast and now she lives here in Colorado. She
[15:01.500 --> 15:04.260]  is a trimmer and she still listens to me while she's trimming. That's fucking
[15:04.260 --> 15:07.300]  awesome. You must have been listening for a long time because you've been here
[15:07.300 --> 15:11.820]  for a long time. Dude I did have an awesome 420. I hope your 420 was as good
[15:11.820 --> 15:15.500]  as mine. I was at work but I was hanging out with some of my best friends. My work
[15:15.500 --> 15:19.080]  crew and I we have become really good friends so it wasn't too bad to be stuck
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.420]  at work and if you're wondering yes we did sneak away as promised at 420 and
[15:23.420 --> 15:28.380]  everybody was super medicated. We kind of made it a short day that day. Shout
[15:28.380 --> 15:32.100]  out to Steph for trying to pull it together. But yes I did have a good 420
[15:32.100 --> 15:37.300]  and Rachel you're completely welcome for everything that you have received from
[15:37.300 --> 15:41.180]  my podcast and thanks to you guys. You guys have been good friends. You came to
[15:41.180 --> 15:45.140]  my surprise birthday party and hung out and you guys always make me amazingly
[15:45.140 --> 15:47.980]  delicious extracts and I like it when you come too. You don't have to just send
[15:47.980 --> 15:51.540]  Will to come over and dab. Rachel come dab with us. Come sit at the table. Take
[15:51.540 --> 15:54.340]  some globs. I love watching you take dabs because you take bigger dabs than most
[15:54.340 --> 15:58.540]  of my guy friends. It's fucking funny. So come hang out and super huge thanks for
[15:58.540 --> 16:02.460]  the review. I appreciate it and of course Rachel gave me a five star rating. Why
[16:02.460 --> 16:06.060]  wouldn't she right? That's family. That's what friends are for. Alright thanks
[16:06.060 --> 16:09.340]  again Rachel. I appreciate it. I look forward to dabbing with you sometime
[16:09.340 --> 16:13.060]  soon. Come pick up some material so that Will can make me some more super good
[16:13.060 --> 16:17.900]  extracts. Also she ended that that review with a couple of multi-colored hearts.
[16:17.940 --> 16:22.340]  Thanks for that. I love seeing emojis. Emojis make my day. Alright I'm really
[16:22.340 --> 16:26.140]  rambling today guys. I hope you can deal with that. If not you probably just turn
[16:26.140 --> 16:30.020]  me off by now which is cool also. I still love you. Don't worry. The next review
[16:30.020 --> 16:34.100]  comes from somebody. Let me see if I can read your name because it's uh it's not
[16:34.100 --> 16:40.740]  clear. It's Jacob Ryan but it's spelled kind of funny. It's J-A-Y-K-U-B-R-Y-A-N
[16:40.740 --> 16:44.580]  Jacob Ryan. I hope I said that right. This review was left on April 11th of
[16:44.580 --> 16:48.780]  2017. Of course Jacob Ryan left me a five-star review and the review goes
[16:48.780 --> 16:53.580]  like this. The Joe Rogan of Marijuana. Amazing podcast. Can't wait to hear more
[16:53.580 --> 16:57.140]  of this. I'm moving to Colorado in October. Can't wait to meet and sesh with
[16:57.140 --> 17:03.740]  people like you. I'm just gonna take a moment. This dude just called me the Joe
[17:03.740 --> 17:10.140]  Rogan experience of marijuana. I'm fucking honored. Joe Rogan is my favorite
[17:10.140 --> 17:13.620]  podcaster. Joe Rogan is one of my favorite comedians. The Joe Rogan
[17:13.620 --> 17:18.180]  experience podcast is my most listened to podcast probably because he puts out
[17:18.180 --> 17:20.780]  nine to twelve hours of content every fucking week and you can't stop
[17:20.780 --> 17:25.700]  listening but to be compared to my podcast hero to one of my favorite
[17:25.700 --> 17:30.020]  podcasts to probably the number one most popular podcast on the planet to be
[17:30.020 --> 17:33.820]  compared to Joe Rogan that's a true honor so thank you. I could just
[17:33.820 --> 17:37.140]  turn off the mic right now. Mic drop. Thump. I could go home and be a satisfied
[17:37.140 --> 17:43.140]  podcaster. I won't do that to you but I could so thanks. This podcast is it's not
[17:43.140 --> 17:45.900]  a lot of work but it's work you know what I mean I got to sit here for the
[17:45.900 --> 17:49.180]  duration of the podcast and run my face and then there's a lot of preparation
[17:49.180 --> 17:53.340]  I've got editing to do I've got to post the show I've got a website to try and
[17:53.340 --> 17:57.780]  fucking maintain apparently there's some work that goes into it so to hear people
[17:57.780 --> 18:02.900]  say that I'm the Joe Rogan of marijuana and for all the people at the Dude Grows
[18:02.900 --> 18:06.900]  Cup that told me how much I helped their grows and helped them succeed and how
[18:06.900 --> 18:10.660]  much I've improved their gardens all of that shit makes it worth it. The Patreon
[18:10.740 --> 18:14.060]  contributions those are fucking awesome I really appreciate those but when
[18:14.060 --> 18:18.100]  people just say hey your words and your wisdom made my garden better and hey
[18:18.100 --> 18:22.180]  you're the Joe Rogan of cannabis that's fucking huge for me that puts some pride
[18:22.180 --> 18:25.700]  inside of my soul but you guys on Patreon I still love you too don't don't
[18:25.700 --> 18:28.860]  don't act like I don't love you that's awesome but but giving being given
[18:28.860 --> 18:32.320]  praise like that means a lot to me. Alright I've got one more review to read
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.280]  and then I think I'm all caught up this one was left by oh we've got another one
[18:36.280 --> 18:38.620]  of these long names it's a lot of letters pushed together let's try to get
[18:38.620 --> 18:44.180]  it. Tailored Gardens PDX Bud Brother yes I got it. Tailored Gardens PDX Bud
[18:44.180 --> 18:47.740]  Brother apparently this person is from the Portland area they left a review on
[18:47.740 --> 18:52.180]  April 10th of 2017 of course they gave me a five-star review and it goes like
[18:52.180 --> 18:57.380]  this. Dude Rasta I can't begin to thank you enough for all that you do you've
[18:57.380 --> 19:01.180]  made my brother and I excellent growers and continue to share your knowledge and

[20:05.340 --> 20:09.180]  brother excellent growers. That's really cool to hear there's at least two people
[20:09.180 --> 20:13.420]  that have learned something from me and I appreciate that. Alright you guys I've
[20:13.420 --> 20:15.740]  been talking for a long time it feels like I had to have been going for at
[20:15.740 --> 20:19.340]  least 20 minutes now my throat is indicating that it needs a liquid so I'm
[20:19.340 --> 20:21.980]  gonna press pause here for a couple of seconds I'm gonna take myself a drink
[20:21.980 --> 20:25.620]  you know I'm gonna take a couple of fat dabs and when we get back we'll get into
[20:25.620 --> 20:30.060]  a podcast. Alright podcast world I am back I'm well hydrated I'm well
[20:30.060 --> 20:34.300]  caffeinated and I am ready to rant for a few more minutes. I just took a couple
[20:34.300 --> 20:39.420]  of fat dabs of some Grateful Dog Shatter. It was bred by me, grown by me,
[20:39.420 --> 20:43.180]  and extracted by our friends at the Barefoot Extracts. Big shout out to
[20:43.180 --> 20:47.420]  Barefoot Extracts I appreciate you bro. Hey I've got more material come see me
[20:47.420 --> 20:50.940]  come say what's up come take some dabs and pick up some material let's get some
[20:50.940 --> 20:55.180]  more hash going. Yeah alright speaking of Grateful Dog kind of random there if you
[20:55.180 --> 20:57.740]  don't know about the Grateful Dog that doesn't correlate at all but speaking of
[20:57.740 --> 21:01.620]  Grateful Dog somebody was asking me about selecting male plants. Now I've
[21:01.620 --> 21:06.060]  done full episodes on male selection and how to select male plants for breeding.
[21:06.060 --> 21:09.700]  Something I did not mention before something that I thought was a trick up
[21:09.700 --> 21:13.460]  my own sleeve something I didn't know was so well known but I've seen it on
[21:13.460 --> 21:15.900]  Facebook a lot of people were talking about it so now I feel more comfortable
[21:15.900 --> 21:20.780]  sharing my knowledge. There are some things I do like to keep to myself but
[21:20.780 --> 21:26.340]  it is time to share this little secret. If you are looking to choose a male for
[21:26.340 --> 21:31.580]  breeding first of all I'm not gonna go over the whole criteria on how to select
[21:31.580 --> 21:37.140]  a male there are a lot of things to look for mainly shape, structure, aroma, does
[21:37.140 --> 21:41.540]  it produce trichomes, rub the stem, smell your fingers, see what it smells like.
[21:41.540 --> 21:47.500]  Also how long does it take to drop pollen, how long will it drop pollen, how
[21:47.500 --> 21:51.820]  long from the time it starts dropping pollen, how long will it keep dropping
[21:51.820 --> 21:55.020]  pollen. There are a lot of things I like to pay attention to. I could go on and on
[21:55.020 --> 21:59.500]  about male selection. There's another trick that you can use for selecting a
[21:59.500 --> 22:05.060]  male plant. You can so let's say you grow out of 10 pack of seeds and there are
[22:05.060 --> 22:08.300]  there's gonna be five males in there there's a good chance you'll get five
[22:08.300 --> 22:11.460]  males. I usually throw away the first one the first plant to show male I don't
[22:11.460 --> 22:14.860]  want it it's going to be too male it's going to pass on too much of its genes
[22:14.860 --> 22:18.620]  to the progeny and you're just gonna make a copy of that male so I toss that.
[22:18.620 --> 22:22.660]  If the second and third or fourth and fifth one look like look like candidates
[22:22.660 --> 22:27.420]  what I will do is I will reverse those males and turn them into females and
[22:27.420 --> 22:32.540]  flower them and see what they do as a female. I'm gonna say that again because
[22:32.540 --> 22:35.460]  I know a lot of people just scratch their heads and said what the fuck yes
[22:35.460 --> 22:41.300]  I will take a male plant and I will treat it with silver thiosulfate and I
[22:41.300 --> 22:45.500]  will continue to flower that plant until it turns into a female. That male plant
[22:45.500 --> 22:50.900]  will turn into a female plant that will happen if you treat it with silver
[22:50.900 --> 22:57.020]  thiosulfate appropriately and properly. Now I continue to flower it those male
[22:57.020 --> 23:01.860]  flower clusters will turn in to female flowers they will be calyxes and they
[23:01.860 --> 23:08.980]  will form buds. It will be 90% close to what that plant is going to look like if
[23:08.980 --> 23:11.420]  it were actually the female. It's gonna be a little funky because you just
[23:11.420 --> 23:15.700]  fucked it up but it's gonna give you a very good 90 to 99 percent I don't want
[23:15.700 --> 23:18.300]  to tell you it's gonna be a hundred percent exact it's gonna be super close
[23:18.300 --> 23:22.620]  to what that plant would be like if it were a true female and it will show
[23:22.620 --> 23:27.120]  you the traits. Now you can see does it produce resin? Does it smell? Does it make
[23:27.120 --> 23:31.580]  big chunky heavy buds? Does it make pretty colors? Is it something desirable
[23:31.580 --> 23:35.380]  to use in breeding? Does it have traits that I want to pass on to make another
[23:35.380 --> 23:40.460]  creation? So yes you can reverse a male cannabis plant using silver thiosulfate
[23:40.460 --> 23:44.540]  to turn it into a female and see what type of traits you are passing on to
[23:44.540 --> 23:50.740]  your breeding stock. I know I was quiet for a long time there I know a lot of
[23:50.740 --> 23:53.620]  people are gonna be blown the fuck away by this because when I started talking
[23:53.620 --> 23:56.500]  about it on Facebook and when I saw it on Facebook a lot of people had a lot
[23:56.500 --> 24:01.060]  of questions. Now people are gonna say how do you reverse a male plant or a
[24:01.060 --> 24:05.820]  female plant? A lot of people have used the colloidal silver method I do not use
[24:05.820 --> 24:09.780]  that I find that to be unreliable and not effective and that's that's
[24:09.780 --> 24:13.140]  redundant right? Unreliable and not effective whatever it doesn't work well
[24:13.140 --> 24:17.700]  enough you need to spray it too many times. I like to use silver thiosulfate I
[24:17.700 --> 24:22.300]  order powdered silver and I think it's powdered sodium thiosulfate I haven't
[24:22.300 --> 24:24.860]  ordered it in a long time so I haven't read it and it makes me feel dumb that I
[24:24.860 --> 24:28.500]  don't know what it is right away but I know what the shit is I've got them I
[24:28.500 --> 24:34.380]  order the two powdered containers I mix them into jars of distilled water you
[24:34.380 --> 24:37.780]  put so much of powder A into a jar so much of powder B into a jar you shake it
[24:37.780 --> 24:41.300]  with the distilled water so that it really dissolves in there real well and
[24:41.300 --> 24:46.820]  then you put 50% of part A and 50% of part B into more water you mix them into
[24:46.820 --> 24:50.940]  more water to make the dilution that you need and each plant is going to need a
[24:50.940 --> 24:54.260]  different concentration I have hit plants with straight-up undiluted the
[24:54.260 --> 24:58.340]  undiluted mix before they get real burnt up but they will reverse very quickly
[24:58.340 --> 25:04.100]  some plants prefer one heavy dose some plants prefer a few light doses some
[25:04.100 --> 25:07.740]  plants it's better to start hitting them with the silver thiosulfate before you
[25:07.740 --> 25:13.700]  even flower them this is going to take some experimentation on your part so if
[25:13.700 --> 25:16.660]  you want to do this if you want to reverse a male or a female you need to
[25:16.660 --> 25:20.860]  get the silver thiosulfate solutions I've talked about this before and I'm
[25:20.860 --> 25:24.300]  gonna say it again when you are playing with these chemicals they are chemicals
[25:24.300 --> 25:29.220]  please wear proper gloves not just little latex gloves you need thicker
[25:29.220 --> 25:32.300]  gloves you need the proper safety equipment so that you don't hurt
[25:32.300 --> 25:36.380]  yourself also you need eyewear anytime you're playing with any chemicals any
[25:36.420 --> 25:39.740]  pesticides anything liquid anything that can just end up in your eye by
[25:39.740 --> 25:43.580]  fucking sneezing or bumping something wrong please wear some protective eye
[25:43.580 --> 25:47.220]  gear your Oakley's your method sevens do not fucking count get yourself some
[25:47.220 --> 25:50.340]  laboratory approved glasses please protect your eyes they're the most
[25:50.340 --> 25:54.260]  sensitive organs exposed to the elements you only got two of them and you need
[25:54.260 --> 25:56.820]  them both you don't want to walk around like a pirate for the rest of your life
[25:56.820 --> 26:00.240]  because you made a mistake please protect your eyes so get the silver
[26:00.240 --> 26:07.560]  thiosulfate get it into the water the dilutions I can post it on I can post it
[26:07.560 --> 26:12.800]  on it'll be in the show notes I'm gonna write it down there we go I wrote it
[26:12.800 --> 26:16.800]  down put the dilutions in the show notes so you'll have to put silver thiosulfate
[26:16.800 --> 26:20.000]  powders into the liquids and you mix those together into one container and
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.800]  then you put that in a spray bottle and spray your male plant or your female
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.960]  plant whichever plant you're trying to reverse spray the shit out of it I soak
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.360]  it make sure to get the stocks not just the leaves get the stems you want to get
[26:31.360 --> 26:34.920]  the stocks of that plant also you want to soak the plant with the silver
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.520]  thiosulfate I would recommend doing it seven to ten days before you put it into
[26:40.520 --> 26:45.480]  flour hit it and then this is where you have to decide if you want to hit it
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.480]  with undiluted silver thiosulfate solution or if you want to kind of
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.520]  dilute it a little bit some plants like a 10% dilution some like 50 some need a
[26:52.520 --> 26:57.320]  90 if you hit it with the undiluted the plants are going to crinkle up and look
[26:57.320 --> 27:01.080]  like you kicked the shit out of them you will however reverse the plant you'll
[27:01.080 --> 27:04.160]  get the effect if you're going for pollen they will make pollen if you're
[27:04.160 --> 27:06.880]  trying to turn it into a female it will turn it into a female but it's gonna
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.880]  look like shit if you want to be more gentle use a lighter dilution and spray
[27:10.880 --> 27:14.080]  more frequently and start earlier I don't know how else to explain that you
[27:14.080 --> 27:16.920]  can go hard a few times you're gonna fuck up the plant and it will work or
[27:16.920 --> 27:20.520]  you can go light more frequently and you won't see as much damage but it will
[27:20.520 --> 27:26.320]  take more more sprays and more time to make it work you're gonna have to
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.600]  experiment with golden goat I had to spray that bitch every single day to get
[27:30.600 --> 27:36.320]  her to reverse I was using silver thiosulfate at about a 30% dilution so I
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.280]  would mix the two into the containers of water and I was calling that a hundred
[27:40.280 --> 27:44.560]  percent when I mixed them that was 100% of the solution then I would add water
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.800]  to it and dilute it and that's what I was calling my dilution rates my 50 to
[27:48.800 --> 27:51.920]  30% however much water I added to it that's what I was calling the dilution
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.800]  so if I had half water half my solution that was a 50-50 the golden goat really
[27:56.800 --> 28:00.400]  needed to be blasted a lot I learned that if I started blasting the golden
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.240]  goat early before I put her into flower like 10 days before I put it into flower
[28:04.240 --> 28:08.720]  spray it every single day until I start seeing male plants then it would really
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.280]  reverse if I wasn't aggressive with it the golden goat would not reverse what
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.760]  else did I try to try to reverse the the pure a fee the fucker reversed with like
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.880]  just one strong spray I just hit it right at the start of flower and the
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.400]  leaves curled up all weird and then like day 14 of flower you could see those male
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.000]  male plant are the male balls just building up so it didn't take much at
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.400]  all for the for the pure a fee that one just reversed right away you guys don't
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.000]  hear a lot about the pure a fee because it sucked it wasn't fun to work with I
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.200]  didn't like the progeny so it disappeared sometimes you got to throw
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.880]  shit away just how stuff works all right you guys my throat's burnt out my ADD is
