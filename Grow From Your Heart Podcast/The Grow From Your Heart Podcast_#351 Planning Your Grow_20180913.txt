[00:00.000 --> 00:02.360]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.360 --> 00:05.600]  It's time for episode 351 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.600 --> 00:06.600]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.120]  No long fancy intro today.
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.420]  We're going to get right into this podcast.
[00:10.420 --> 00:13.920]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:13.920 --> 00:18.960]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.560]  Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:24.560 --> 00:27.960]  You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:27.960 --> 00:30.880]  Today I've been taking dabs of Whammy Bar Nectar.
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.480]  This is a combo of lemon essence and papaya.
[00:33.480 --> 00:37.560]  The flavor is described as honeysuckle, lemon candy, and lemon candies.
[00:37.560 --> 00:39.740]  We've talked about this one on the show before.
[00:39.740 --> 00:45.240]  I think the dab I just took tasted a lot like kiwi strawberry Snapple.
[00:45.240 --> 00:47.000]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.520]  Let's move this podcast forward.
[00:48.520 --> 00:51.240]  I have got a lot to talk about today.
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.080]  I have been talking about doing a series of episodes that run my listeners from the very
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.200]  beginning of a grow all the way to the very end of a grow.
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.040]  I want to talk about selecting your grow space.
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.440]  I want to talk about sprouting seeds and cutting clones all the way through the veg phase,
[01:06.440 --> 01:08.400]  all the way to flower, all the way up to harvest.
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.080]  And then we'll talk about drying and curing.
[01:10.080 --> 01:12.640]  Once again, I want to go from beginning to end.
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.380]  I'm going to do a long series of detailed episodes and this will be the first episode
[01:17.380 --> 01:19.280]  in that series.
[01:19.280 --> 01:22.200]  In this episode, we're going to talk about planning your garden.
[01:22.200 --> 01:24.480]  We'll talk about setting goals for your garden.
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.640]  And we'll also give you a few tips on how to stay out of trouble and avoid common mistakes
[01:29.640 --> 01:32.480]  people make when setting up a new grow.
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.360]  So now that I've got a solid intro laid down, I'm going to press pause.
[01:35.360 --> 01:37.980]  I'm going to take a couple of dabs while you grab a notebook.
[01:37.980 --> 01:42.160]  And when we get back, we're going to talk about planning your cannabis garden.
[01:42.160 --> 01:44.280]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[01:44.280 --> 01:45.360]  I am well medicated.
[01:45.360 --> 01:46.480]  I am well hydrated.
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.080]  I hope you grabbed a pen and some paper because there will be a lot of information in this
[01:51.080 --> 01:52.360]  episode.
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.280]  Let's get into planning your new garden.
[01:55.280 --> 01:58.960]  Before we start shopping for lights and seeds and planning for your first harvest, there
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.360]  are a few things you can do to make your growing experience more enjoyable.
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.440]  The first piece of advice I have for anybody who is planning to start a new grow is to
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.600]  buy grow books from reputable grow authors.
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.920]  Authors I can recommend are Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert Connell
[02:17.920 --> 02:20.160]  Clark and Drew West.
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.320]  Now the second piece of advice is to open those books and read them.
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.280]  I recommend you read the whole book before you start growing.
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.000]  That way you know what to expect before problems arise.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.360]  That way if a problem does pop up, you know what you've got because you've seen it in
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.360]  the book.
[02:36.360 --> 02:37.440]  You know how to diagnose it.
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.520]  You know how to treat it.
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.600]  That way you don't make the problem worse by diagnosing a problem under pressure and
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.120]  making the wrong decision.
[02:44.120 --> 02:49.240]  So get yourself a grow book from a reputable grower and read that book.
[02:49.240 --> 02:55.840]  Once again, I like Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert Connell Clark, Drew West.
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.160]  There are a ton of great cannabis authors out there.
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.820]  Reading books will give you an idea of what to expect and you'll have an eye for things
[03:02.820 --> 03:04.040]  when they pop up.
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.740]  You won't have as many surprises.
[03:06.740 --> 03:10.540]  You can find books from most of the authors I listed on Amazon.
[03:10.540 --> 03:16.240]  You can also find a lot of great free PDF files if you do a quick Google search.
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.520]  Another great way to increase your cannabis knowledge is by listening to cannabis podcasts.
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.280]  If you're a new grower, I recommend shows like The Dude Grows and Free Weed.
[03:26.280 --> 03:31.320]  If you're an advanced grower, I recommend shows like Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.560]  and Shaping Fire.
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.600]  Another great way to learn about cannabis is through YouTube.
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.940]  There are a lot of great cannabis YouTube channels out there, but you don't have to
[03:41.940 --> 03:46.540]  watch cannabis-specific videos to learn about growing.
[03:46.540 --> 03:51.420]  You can watch basic plant biology and basic horticulture videos, and most of that is going
[03:51.420 --> 03:53.780]  to apply to your cannabis garden.
[03:53.780 --> 03:57.220]  So learn about the plants, learn about the way that they function, and learn why they
[03:57.220 --> 04:00.920]  do what they do through those YouTube videos.
[04:00.920 --> 04:03.700]  One thing I would avoid is cannabis forums.
[04:03.700 --> 04:06.460]  There is a lot of crap in cannabis forums.
[04:06.460 --> 04:07.860]  That's part of why I started this show.
[04:07.860 --> 04:13.220]  I saw people giving terrible advice on cannabis forums, and I wanted to come on here and correct
[04:13.220 --> 04:14.220]  that.
[04:14.220 --> 04:17.540]  So be really careful if you're taking advice from cannabis forums.
[04:17.540 --> 04:24.100]  I would recommend you avoid them completely and stick with books, podcasts, and YouTube
[04:24.100 --> 04:26.820]  channels from reputable growers.
[04:26.820 --> 04:31.380]  So my first piece of advice is to buy and read grow books from reputable growers, then
[04:31.380 --> 04:36.820]  supplement that education with knowledge from YouTube and podcasts.
[04:36.820 --> 04:42.140]  Now before we go too much further with our plans to grow, we've got some things to consider.
[04:42.140 --> 04:45.140]  An important thing to think about is legality.
[04:45.140 --> 04:48.340]  Is it legal to grow where you're planning to set up?
[04:48.340 --> 04:51.060]  If it is illegal, I can't recommend you grow there.
[04:51.060 --> 04:54.620]  I've got to tell you to obey the laws.
[04:54.620 --> 04:59.580]  If you do choose to grow in an illegal area, keep in mind that you are now committing a
[04:59.580 --> 05:05.980]  crime that could result in a life-changing experience for you, your family, and everyone
[05:06.140 --> 05:08.260]  in that household.
[05:08.260 --> 05:12.980]  If you are suspected of running an illegal grow in your home, the police, possibly the
[05:12.980 --> 05:18.860]  SWAT team, possibly the DEA, will kick in your door and drag you and your family into
[05:18.860 --> 05:23.380]  your front lawn in your underwear while they destroy your entire house.
[05:23.380 --> 05:25.980]  They go through everything.
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.860]  They will take all of your money.
[05:27.860 --> 05:30.100]  They'll take your firearms if you have any.
[05:30.100 --> 05:32.300]  They will probably shoot your dog.
[05:32.300 --> 05:34.260]  They may shoot you.
[05:34.260 --> 05:39.220]  If your family is home, they will be detained and possibly shot if they don't react properly
[05:39.220 --> 05:41.380]  to police instructions.
[05:41.380 --> 05:44.060]  Your house is now a drug house.
[05:44.060 --> 05:46.020]  They come in ready for war.
[05:46.020 --> 05:51.380]  Your wife and kids will never forget the morning the door came off and armed men came in and
[05:51.380 --> 05:53.900]  took you to jail and destroyed the house.
[05:53.900 --> 05:57.100]  Your life will never be the same.
[05:57.100 --> 05:59.420]  Think about this before you choose to set up.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.860]  I know that sounds dramatic.
[06:00.860 --> 06:05.060]  It is dramatic and it will be traumatic for you and everyone involved.
[06:05.060 --> 06:06.980]  I can't stress this enough.
[06:06.980 --> 06:10.860]  Think about this before you hang up your grow lights.
[06:10.860 --> 06:14.300]  Think about this before you order your seeds.
[06:14.300 --> 06:18.420]  Also keep in mind that you are producing a high-value product.
[06:18.420 --> 06:22.460]  Start thinking now about what you're going to do if somebody tries to come in your home
[06:22.460 --> 06:25.220]  and take that from you while you are there.
[06:25.220 --> 06:30.700]  Think about it now so that you know what you're getting into before the time comes.
[06:30.740 --> 06:35.740]  Now that I've made that important disclaimer, let's move forward.
[06:35.740 --> 06:37.540]  Let's think about why you are growing.
[06:37.540 --> 06:38.980]  Are you growing to supply yourself?
[06:38.980 --> 06:41.560]  Are you growing to supply a sick family member?
[06:41.560 --> 06:43.580]  Are you trying to be the next Neighborhood Hookup?
[06:43.580 --> 06:47.340]  Are you trying to be the next Pablo Escobar of cannabis?
[06:47.340 --> 06:52.160]  Think about the real reason for your grow and have a goal in mind.
[06:52.160 --> 06:57.140]  If your goal is to supply yourself, think about how much product you need every 60 to
[06:57.140 --> 07:02.980]  90 days and set up a grow that will supply that for yourself plus maybe a little extra
[07:02.980 --> 07:07.740]  in case you have an issue or a delay in your next cycle.
[07:07.740 --> 07:11.380]  Growing enough product to supply yourself should be an easy goal.
[07:11.380 --> 07:15.060]  Growing enough to supply the whole neighborhood is when it starts to get risky.
[07:15.060 --> 07:19.840]  Every time you hang up another light, you increase your chances of trouble exponentially
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.100]  in my opinion.
[07:21.100 --> 07:24.180]  So think about the risks involved before you expand.
[07:24.180 --> 07:30.780]  I always recommend starting small, learning how to grow, and then expand from there.
[07:30.780 --> 07:36.200]  So think about what you realistically expect from your grow and set a goal for yourself.
[07:36.200 --> 07:40.580]  Your grow is going to be limited by the amount of space you have, the amount of equipment
[07:40.580 --> 07:45.920]  you have, and also the amount of electricity you can provide to that space.
[07:45.920 --> 07:51.040]  One of your goals is to figure out how to maximize the yield from the amount of space
[07:51.040 --> 07:52.040]  you have got.
[07:52.400 --> 07:56.800]  A reasonable goal is 1 pound per 1000 watt light.
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.460]  And a 1000 watt light usually is good for about a 4x4 to a 5x5 space.
[08:02.460 --> 08:08.920]  So you would expect about 1 pound per every 4x4 or 5x5 foot space.
[08:08.920 --> 08:10.660]  Now don't expect that right away.
[08:10.660 --> 08:12.200]  You've got to learn how to grow.
[08:12.200 --> 08:13.760]  You've got to learn the genetics.
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.000]  You've got to learn your nutrients and you've got to dial in the room.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.020]  But to give you guys an estimate and help you design and set up your room and understand
[08:21.020 --> 08:27.260]  how to reach your goals, you can reasonably expect 1 pound per 1000 watt light once you
[08:27.260 --> 08:28.260]  get good at growing.
[08:28.260 --> 08:32.580]  Now once you really get good at growing, you should increase that goal to closer to 2 pounds
[08:32.580 --> 08:33.580]  per light.
[08:33.580 --> 08:37.180]  And if you move into the double-ended bulb technology, you can certainly increase your
[08:37.180 --> 08:40.380]  expectations much more with more lighting.
[08:40.380 --> 08:43.980]  Of course, all of what I'm talking about is with high pressure sodium lighting, high intensity
[08:43.980 --> 08:45.180]  discharge lighting.
[08:45.180 --> 08:51.100]  I do not have enough experience with LEDs to give you any estimates or expectations.
[08:51.100 --> 08:54.940]  And again, this is all just rough expectations, rough estimates.
[08:54.940 --> 09:00.540]  About a pound per 1000 watt light is your general goal once you learn how to grow.
[09:00.540 --> 09:03.700]  Don't focus too much on yields when you're getting started.
[09:03.700 --> 09:08.540]  Focus more on learning the needs of the plant, understanding the cycles of the plant, and
[09:08.540 --> 09:11.520]  learning how to see what the plants are telling you.
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.280]  Focus more on that when you get started, then the yields will come, the quality will
[09:15.280 --> 09:16.280]  come.
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.680]  When you develop a relationship with the plant, everything will fall into place.
[09:19.680 --> 09:20.800]  So learn how to grow.
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.080]  I'm just giving you a rough idea of what you can expect once you get dialed in.
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.040]  Now let's get back on track with things we need to think about when planning our grow.
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.000]  The next thing I've got written down is safety and security.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.440]  We're going to talk about that in detail in the next episode, which is going to be selecting
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.000]  and planning your space.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.360]  This is going to be overall planning your grow.
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.320]  The next episode will focus more in on your space.
[09:44.320 --> 09:46.980]  So for safety and security, we're going to go quickly.
[09:46.980 --> 09:48.320]  You need to worry about the law.
[09:48.320 --> 09:50.200]  I already talked in depth about that.
[09:50.200 --> 09:52.040]  You need to worry about thieves and criminals.
[09:52.040 --> 09:54.000]  I already talked a little bit about that.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.620]  So safety and security will be discussed more in the next episode.
[09:57.620 --> 10:00.120]  Another thing I have got is water.
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.280]  Is water accessible and affordable where you plan to grow?
[10:04.280 --> 10:08.800]  Also do you have an excuse for the extra water consumption?
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.340]  The next thing on the list is electricity.
[10:11.340 --> 10:16.500]  When you're planning your grow, keep in mind that you will be very limited by the amount
[10:16.500 --> 10:20.100]  of electricity you can pull from a home.
[10:20.100 --> 10:24.620]  Most homes have a one or 200 amp service depending on your location.
[10:24.620 --> 10:28.820]  If you've only got a hundred amp service, you will be very limited on how many lights
[10:28.820 --> 10:29.820]  you can run.
[10:29.820 --> 10:32.740]  If you've got 200 amps of service, you'll still be limited.
[10:32.740 --> 10:37.300]  In my experience, when they put the electricity in your house, they did not consider you adding
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.440]  1000 watt grow lights.
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.080]  They put just enough for you to run all of the appliances and things in your house and
[10:44.080 --> 10:46.800]  also plug in the blow dryer and the microwave.
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.580]  They don't give you a lot of extra amperage because they never thought you were going
[10:50.580 --> 10:53.920]  to plug in these high powered devices.
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.720]  So you're going to be limited by the amount of electricity.
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.840]  Before you go out and buy 4000 watt lights, maybe buy two and plug them both in and see
[11:02.840 --> 11:05.000]  if you start flipping breakers.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.360]  I'm sure you won't be able to plug in two 1000 watt lights into the same receptacle
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.600]  in one room.
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.160]  That little plug in right there, it's got the plug in on top, the plug in on the bottom.
[11:15.160 --> 11:17.880]  You got your phone plugged into one, you got the computer plugged into the other.
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.080]  You cannot plug in two 1000 watt lights into that.
[11:21.080 --> 11:22.080]  That will flip the breaker.
[11:22.080 --> 11:24.920]  You're going to run out to the garage or wherever, you're going to flip the breaker.
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.520]  You're going to make it come on again.
[11:26.520 --> 11:28.200]  It's going to start heating up the receptacle.
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.760]  It's going to blow the receptacle or it's going to catch the wires on fire.
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.760]  Don't try to plug in 2000 watt lights into the same plug in.
[11:36.760 --> 11:41.360]  You might not even be able to run two 1000 watt lights in the same room if both of the
[11:41.360 --> 11:43.960]  plug ins are on the same breaker.
[11:43.960 --> 11:50.880]  Most of the breakers in your house are going to be 10 amps, maybe 20 amps and maybe 35
[11:50.880 --> 11:52.400]  amps if you're really lucky.
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.460]  Older homes are going to have 10s and 20s.
[11:54.460 --> 11:58.300]  More modern homes, you may have up to 35 amp breakers.
[11:58.300 --> 12:02.500]  Most of our 1000 watt grow lights pull about 8 to 11 amps.
[12:02.500 --> 12:05.560]  When they fire up, they want to pull 11 amps to get started.
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.020]  As they're running, they'll drop down to around 7 or 8 amps.
[12:09.020 --> 12:13.340]  You have to keep that in mind when you're designing and thinking about your grow.
[12:13.340 --> 12:18.120]  How much amperage is available in the space in which you plan to grow?
[12:18.120 --> 12:20.860]  Don't expect to run a bunch of extension cords because they're going to get hot, they're
[12:20.860 --> 12:24.120]  going to melt, they're going to catch on fire, they're going to start flipping breakers.
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.040]  That's going to cause more problems.
[12:26.040 --> 12:30.160]  Just realize that you either need to upgrade the electrical or you need to settle for less
[12:30.160 --> 12:31.160]  lights.
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.120]  Also, keep in mind that for every light you hang, you probably need a blower or a fan
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.200]  or some sort of electricities.
[12:38.200 --> 12:41.640]  Allow extra amperage for your accessories.
[12:41.640 --> 12:42.640]  You've also got to run the house.
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.940]  You have to turn on lights in the refrigerator and what if somebody tries to run the microwave
[12:46.940 --> 12:48.540]  and it blows up the whole grow?
[12:48.540 --> 12:50.360]  Keep that sort of stuff in mind.
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.080]  Don't burn down the house with your grow.
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.520]  We'll talk more about electricity in the selecting your space episode as well.
[12:58.520 --> 12:59.520]  Also, airflow.
[12:59.520 --> 13:01.000]  You're going to need airflow.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.920]  We will talk in depth about airflow in the next episode.
[13:04.920 --> 13:05.920]  Trash.
[13:05.920 --> 13:12.240]  You guys, people don't consider how much trash they will create when they're building and
[13:12.240 --> 13:13.920]  running a grow.
[13:13.920 --> 13:17.960]  You're going to have boxes that say high pressure sodium grow light on them.
[13:17.960 --> 13:21.440]  You're going to have to think about how to get rid of that discreetly.
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.160]  You'll have empty nutrient bottles that you need to figure out how to get rid of discreetly.
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.640]  Then when we harvest, we've got to figure out how to get rid of that old root ball,
[13:29.640 --> 13:31.920]  all of the sticks and all of that dirt.
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.040]  That's something to start thinking about before we start buying grow lights and buying our
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.460]  seeds.
[13:37.460 --> 13:41.000]  Another thing to think about is the odor and aroma of your grow.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.140]  You don't want to snitch on yourself by having a stinky garden.
[13:45.140 --> 13:48.020]  If you do a good job, your plants are going to stink.
[13:48.020 --> 13:53.180]  You will need some sort of carbon filtration to prevent the whole neighborhood from smelling
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.320]  your grow.
[13:55.320 --> 13:58.980]  Something a lot of people don't think about is when you start cutting down your first
[13:58.980 --> 14:00.860]  grow, it really stinks.
[14:00.860 --> 14:04.400]  When you start chopping into those plants, you start breaking open the turps, that's
[14:04.400 --> 14:05.740]  when it really stinks.
[14:05.740 --> 14:09.620]  If you thought it smelled good around week six, seven, and eight, wait till you cut them
[14:09.620 --> 14:13.660]  down and you start chopping into them, that's when it's really going to stink.
[14:13.660 --> 14:16.340]  Be prepared for that harvest stink.
[14:16.660 --> 14:20.100]  Also, at harvest time, you've got to think about that trash.
[14:20.100 --> 14:22.100]  You've got to think about all that soil.
[14:22.100 --> 14:27.620]  Then you've got a lot of herb to learn how to dry and cure and store.
[14:27.620 --> 14:29.200]  How are you going to dry it?
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.200]  How are you going to cure it?
[14:30.200 --> 14:31.660]  Do you have space for that?
[14:31.660 --> 14:32.820]  Where are you going to store it?
[14:32.820 --> 14:34.420]  Do you have space for that?
[14:34.420 --> 14:41.300]  Those are things to start thinking about before you hang up any lights and buy any seeds.
[14:41.300 --> 14:44.780]  Here is a huge thing to think about when you're planning your grow.
[14:44.780 --> 14:47.100]  What kind of nutrients are you going to use?
[14:47.100 --> 14:50.860]  Are you going to go organic or are you going to go synthetic?
[14:50.860 --> 14:52.780]  Are you going to go a living soil?
[14:52.780 --> 14:54.560]  Are you going to go cocoa?
[14:54.560 --> 14:56.060]  Are you going to do no-till?
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.940]  Are you going to do hydro?
[14:57.940 --> 14:59.820]  All of that stuff is up to you.
[14:59.820 --> 15:02.860]  You've got a lot of decisions to make.
[15:02.860 --> 15:06.500]  Everything has its advantage and everything has its disadvantage.
[15:06.500 --> 15:11.720]  Through this long series of episodes, I will try to go over the pros and cons of organic
[15:11.720 --> 15:14.540]  and synthetic, of hydro and soil.
[15:14.580 --> 15:15.900]  I'll talk about cocoa.
[15:15.900 --> 15:17.140]  I'll talk about dirt.
[15:17.140 --> 15:21.780]  I will try to talk about all of that stuff and help you make those decisions.
[15:21.780 --> 15:24.100]  But now is the time to start thinking about it.
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.660]  Do you want to go organic?
[15:25.660 --> 15:27.220]  Do you want to go synthetic?
[15:27.220 --> 15:32.380]  Along with that decision comes pest control, integrated pest management.
[15:32.380 --> 15:35.700]  Do you want to apply spray applications of pesticides?
[15:35.700 --> 15:38.140]  Do you want to use predator bugs?
[15:38.140 --> 15:42.140]  All of these options have their pros and cons and they're all up to you.
[15:42.140 --> 15:47.700]  You'll need to find a pest management system that also works with your nutrient system.
[15:47.700 --> 15:51.860]  If you're running a full organic system, you don't want to go in there and apply a toxic
[15:51.860 --> 15:56.940]  pesticide that could disrupt the environment you've spent so much time creating.
[15:56.940 --> 16:00.260]  One of your major things to think about will be your medium.
[16:00.260 --> 16:03.900]  Do you want to run soil, soilless mix, cocoa, perlite?
[16:03.900 --> 16:05.860]  Do you want to run rockwool cubes?
[16:05.860 --> 16:07.900]  It is all up to you.
[16:07.900 --> 16:11.660]  Along with that decision, you get to decide what you're going to feed those plants.
[16:11.660 --> 16:12.980]  Do you want to go all organic?
[16:12.980 --> 16:14.340]  Do you want to go full synthetics?
[16:14.340 --> 16:15.860]  Do you want to do a combo?
[16:15.860 --> 16:17.580]  That is up to you.
[16:17.580 --> 16:21.940]  Then another major part of that decision is how you are going to prevent pests.
[16:21.940 --> 16:23.860]  It will all work together.
[16:23.860 --> 16:30.100]  Your medium, your nutrients, and your integrated pest management will all become one big unit.
[16:30.100 --> 16:34.140]  So think about that in depth before you make any decisions.
[16:34.140 --> 16:39.580]  And again, as this series continues, I will do a lot of discussions on most of those topics
[16:39.580 --> 16:40.660]  and try to guide you.
[16:40.660 --> 16:42.860]  I will try to remain unbiased.
[16:42.860 --> 16:48.540]  I will talk about how I grow, and I will also try to give you unbiased information on other
[16:48.540 --> 16:54.860]  options and other methods that will work just as well as the way I have chosen to grow.
[16:54.860 --> 16:57.420]  You guys, that's part of the beauty of setting up your own grow.
[16:57.420 --> 16:58.820]  Nobody can tell you what to do.
[16:58.820 --> 17:00.020]  There's no right or wrong way.
[17:00.020 --> 17:01.660]  The wrong way is when your plants die.
[17:01.660 --> 17:05.620]  The right way is when you are happy and you're getting what you want out of the grow.
[17:05.620 --> 17:11.700]  If it's producing the quality, the amount, and you're satisfied, you're doing it correctly.
[17:11.700 --> 17:15.140]  You could probably improve a little bit, but you're doing it right, and nobody can tell
[17:15.140 --> 17:16.380]  you you're doing it wrong.
[17:16.380 --> 17:18.460]  If you're happy with it, it's your grow.
[17:18.460 --> 17:21.800]  Like I said, you're doing it wrong when the plants die or when you get a bunch of bugs,
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.520]  but it's your grow.
[17:23.520 --> 17:24.520]  Make yourself happy.
[17:24.520 --> 17:30.500]  Now, once you put a lot of thought into your medium, your nutrients, your pest control,
[17:30.500 --> 17:35.380]  and if you want to go organic or synthetic, a few more things you should think about are
[17:35.420 --> 17:38.340]  Do you want to grow from seed or from clone?
[17:38.340 --> 17:43.600]  I will do in-depth episodes in the very near future on the advantages and disadvantages
[17:43.600 --> 17:46.020]  of starting from seed or clone.
[17:46.020 --> 17:49.980]  Then I will also talk about how to sprout seeds and we'll also do episodes on cutting
[17:49.980 --> 17:53.380]  clones, so I will go in-depth on that subject.
[17:53.380 --> 17:55.020]  But start thinking about that now.
[17:55.020 --> 17:59.700]  Do you want to grow from seed or do you want to grow from clone?
[17:59.700 --> 18:04.260]  Those are a bunch of great things to think about before you even buy a grow light.
[18:04.260 --> 18:06.660]  Buy a grow book and read it.
[18:06.660 --> 18:11.780]  Find more podcasts that you find educational and entertaining and listen to those podcasts.
[18:11.780 --> 18:16.500]  Then maybe find some YouTube channels that teach you about basic plant sciences and watch
[18:16.500 --> 18:20.900]  those in your free time and get a good understanding of the plant.
[18:20.900 --> 18:23.460]  Then you've got a lot of other things to think about.
[18:23.460 --> 18:27.780]  Legalities, safety and security, water, electricity.
[18:27.780 --> 18:32.220]  Do you have a good excuse for how much electricity you're about to start consuming?
[18:32.220 --> 18:33.620]  That's something to think about.
[18:33.660 --> 18:34.900]  Think about your trash.
[18:34.900 --> 18:38.020]  Think about the aroma you're going to create.
[18:38.020 --> 18:40.020]  Then you get to make that big debate.
[18:40.020 --> 18:45.780]  Nutrients, medium, organic versus synthetic and pesticides.
[18:45.780 --> 18:47.180]  That's something to think about now.
[18:47.180 --> 18:48.980]  Then you get to think about seeds or clones.
[18:48.980 --> 18:51.940]  That is a lot of stuff to have on your mind.
[18:51.940 --> 18:56.220]  The next thing is to think about where to put all of this stuff.
[18:56.220 --> 18:57.540]  Where are we going to put the lights?
[18:57.540 --> 18:59.020]  What room is this going to go in?
[18:59.020 --> 19:01.100]  I can already see the wheels turning in your head.
[19:01.100 --> 19:06.660]  In the next episode, we will go in depth about where to put your grow, planning your
[19:06.660 --> 19:08.260]  grow space.
[19:08.260 --> 19:10.700]  We'll talk more in depth about choosing the correct lighting.
[19:10.700 --> 19:13.060]  We'll talk more in depth about airflow.
[19:13.060 --> 19:17.600]  We'll talk more in depth about all of the specific needs you need to think about when
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.900]  planning your specific grow space in the next episode.
[19:21.900 --> 19:26.660]  I also told you I would give you tips on how to stay out of trouble.
[19:26.660 --> 19:32.140]  The number one tip to stay out of trouble when working in a grow is to keep your mouth
[19:32.140 --> 19:33.140]  shut.
[19:33.140 --> 19:38.360]  If you were in a legal area, if you're in an illegal area, keep your mouth shut.
[19:38.360 --> 19:41.740]  Why does anybody need to know you're growing cannabis?
[19:41.740 --> 19:46.480]  Why does anybody need to know you've got a high value product somewhere in your home?
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.680]  Why does anybody need to know you've got an extra stream of income?
[19:50.680 --> 19:53.140]  Keep your mouth shut.
[19:53.140 --> 19:55.620]  You might think, what about my best friend?
[19:55.620 --> 19:59.740]  What's the best way to turn your best friend into somebody you can't trust?
[19:59.740 --> 20:00.740]  What about your girlfriend?
[20:00.740 --> 20:04.300]  Bro, she might not be your girlfriend forever, and do you want to worry about that shit when
[20:04.300 --> 20:05.740]  you guys break up?
[20:05.740 --> 20:07.300]  Don't tell anybody.
[20:07.300 --> 20:08.460]  Your family is shady.
[20:08.460 --> 20:09.500]  Your bro is shady.
[20:09.500 --> 20:11.120]  Your girlfriend is shady.
[20:11.120 --> 20:15.580]  Everybody changes when there is a high value product sitting on the table and nobody's
[20:15.580 --> 20:16.980]  looking.
[20:16.980 --> 20:20.900]  The best way to keep yourself out of trouble is to not tell anybody.
[20:20.900 --> 20:26.300]  Another piece of advice is to not stink like herb all the time.
[20:26.300 --> 20:31.020]  Before you go places, take a shower, change your clothes, put on some non-herb stinking
[20:31.020 --> 20:32.020]  clothes.
[20:32.020 --> 20:36.100]  Also, don't always have a bunch of herb.
[20:36.100 --> 20:39.060]  Don't start selling herb and making a bunch of extra money.
[20:39.060 --> 20:42.060]  Don't start smoking excessively in front of people.
[20:42.060 --> 20:47.720]  Don't give anybody any obvious signs that you have got access to an excessive amount
[20:47.720 --> 20:49.900]  of cannabis suddenly.
[20:49.900 --> 20:53.900]  Don't raise any eyebrows and don't draw any extra attention to yourself.
[20:53.900 --> 20:56.140]  Just stay out of trouble.
[20:56.140 --> 21:00.860]  That's my quick advice on how to stay out of trouble when you are starting a new grow.
[21:00.860 --> 21:02.700]  Just don't tell anybody.
[21:02.700 --> 21:03.780]  Don't show off.
[21:03.780 --> 21:06.580]  Don't suddenly have too much money and too much herb.
[21:06.580 --> 21:07.960]  Stay low key.
[21:07.960 --> 21:10.820]  Stay the person you were before you started growing.
[21:10.820 --> 21:14.060]  Just stop paying for herb and start growing your own.
[21:14.060 --> 21:18.940]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that was the first episode in a long series of grow
[21:18.940 --> 21:19.940]  lessons.
