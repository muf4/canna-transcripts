[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.720 --> 00:02.920]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:02.920 --> 00:03.920]  I'm your host.
[00:03.920 --> 00:09.640]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 653 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:09.640 --> 00:15.120]  In this episode, Mike is joining me to talk about a new rule change here in Colorado.
[00:15.120 --> 00:16.120]  Welcome to the show, Mike.
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.120]  Thanks, man.
[00:17.120 --> 00:19.120]  And good to be back, everybody.
[00:19.120 --> 00:21.760]  Yeah, I'm glad to have you back, bro.
[00:21.760 --> 00:22.760]  Pandemic had things weird.
[00:22.760 --> 00:26.320]  I don't want to talk too much about the P word, but thanks for joining us, dude.
[00:26.320 --> 00:27.320]  Yeah, let's have a good show.
[00:27.320 --> 00:28.320]  Good, good.
[00:28.320 --> 00:29.320]  I'm glad you're here.
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.040]  I'm glad you're safe, glad you're healthy.
[00:31.040 --> 00:34.320]  Dude, I'm glad you are surviving the flood and the rain.
[00:34.320 --> 00:35.320]  Holy shit.
[00:35.320 --> 00:38.600]  I don't want to sound like an old guy talking too much about the weather, but dude, it is
[00:38.600 --> 00:40.640]  raining in town right now.
[00:40.640 --> 00:43.800]  If our connections look shitty on this Zoom video, you guys, we apologize.
[00:43.800 --> 00:49.680]  It is, I've never said the word deluge, but I think it may be a deluge outside today.
[00:49.680 --> 00:51.280]  That may be the official word.
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.920]  Yeah, there's been a lot of rainfall in the last couple hours, so it's been fine.
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.000]  The grow rooms, the grows are using all of the gear today.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.080]  We had the air conditioner, the dehumidifier, the fan, everything but the heater today.
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.080]  Who knows?
[01:06.080 --> 01:08.760]  Maybe by the end of the night, we'll kick on that heater for a couple of degrees.
[01:08.760 --> 01:10.840]  We're using all of the equipment in the grow room today.
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.240]  Shout out to the grow room gear.
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.160]  The dehumidifier is working for its fucking money today.
[01:15.160 --> 01:16.600]  It's gonna work.
[01:16.600 --> 01:18.240]  Shout out to the dehumidifiers.
[01:18.240 --> 01:21.760]  You're not the most important piece of the room, my face.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.760]  Yeah, today it is working.
[01:22.760 --> 01:24.760]  Today, you went up the list.
[01:25.360 --> 01:27.360]  That's the MVP today is that dehumidifier.
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.440]  Mike, I feel like it is a good chance to give you the opportunity to let us know how people
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.720]  can stalk you on social media and also maybe how they can find you on, what's that Facebook
[01:37.720 --> 01:38.720]  page you got?
[01:38.720 --> 01:39.920]  That's another one I'm thinking about.
[01:39.920 --> 01:45.840]  You can find me at Twitter at Nemopunk15 and you can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
[01:45.840 --> 01:47.560]  sensible cannabis laws.
[01:47.560 --> 01:48.560]  There you go.
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.920]  Give my buddy a follow, stalk him a little bit.
[01:50.920 --> 01:53.040]  Also, how about your Patreon, bro?
[01:53.080 --> 01:55.280]  You want to give a shout out to a few of the Patreon folks?
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.560]  Patreon, yeah, you can find me on Patreon if you'd like to support me and the show at
[01:59.560 --> 02:03.840]  patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.600]  Big shout outs to Tree Star Meadow, Farmer Z, Learning and Burning, OG Purple Thumb,
[02:09.600 --> 02:11.760]  and the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.760]  Really appreciate the support, y'all.
[02:12.760 --> 02:13.760]  Thank you.
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.760]  Glad to help you out, bro.
[02:14.760 --> 02:16.760]  Glad to be back on the show.
[02:16.760 --> 02:19.320]  Actually need to up my contribution to you.
[02:19.320 --> 02:22.800]  I feel like my tier has gone up, so I need to send a little bit more your way.
[02:23.560 --> 02:26.560]  Shit rolls downhill is what they say, right?
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.560]  Yeah, shit, rain, pretty much everything go downhill.
[02:29.560 --> 02:30.560]  Yeah, dude.
[02:30.560 --> 02:31.560]  All right.
[02:31.560 --> 02:32.720]  Let's not focus too much on the weather.
[02:32.720 --> 02:37.520]  I feel like such an old man talking about it's raining cats and dogs out there, but
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.520]  it is fucking tremendous.
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.560]  Someone in my life always says, is the only thing that goes uphill is money.
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.320]  And that's what I was trying not to say.
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.520]  We're just getting older by the minute on this episode.
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.800]  Big shout out to everybody that supports Mike on Patreon.
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.200]  His list is growing.
[02:54.200 --> 02:57.480]  Something I noticed is I've got a list here of people I wanted to give a shout out to,
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.680]  and you just hit half of them.
[02:58.680 --> 03:01.040]  So double shout out to all the people you mentioned.
[03:01.040 --> 03:04.360]  I think all of those people are also part of my Patreon campaign.
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  So thank you guys.
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.360]  Also want to send a thank you.
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.360]  Yeah, I love our supporters.
[03:07.360 --> 03:08.360]  They're the best people on the planet.
[03:08.360 --> 03:09.360]  Yeah, they crush it.
[03:09.360 --> 03:10.360]  Good people.
[03:10.360 --> 03:12.160]  And I'm trying to get this hair off my microphone here just so that doesn't show up for too
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.160]  long.
[03:13.160 --> 03:14.160]  You saw it.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.160]  It was there.
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.160]  I fixed it, you guys.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.160]  Professional show we got.
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.160]  Big shout out to my friend Danky Dave Brett C.
[03:18.160 --> 03:20.480]  Big shout out to my buddy Mike Guacamole Samurai Gardens.
[03:20.480 --> 03:22.280]  Big respect to my buddy Tonto.
[03:22.280 --> 03:28.600]  Farmer Z, Chicago Dabber, Grimbolded Druid, Tree Star Meadow, OG Purple Thumb, The Bafta.
[03:28.600 --> 03:29.600]  My list is longer.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.600]  I'm going to cut it short.
[03:30.600 --> 03:32.080]  I was trying to cover a lot of people today.
[03:32.080 --> 03:35.000]  Big shout out to all of those folks right there for supporting me on Patreon.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.660]  My Patreon is, of course, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:39.660 --> 03:41.360]  There's a link in the show notes video description.
[03:41.360 --> 03:45.920]  I will try to remember maybe when I'm listening and editing, hey, Rasta Jeff, this is your
[03:45.920 --> 03:46.920]  note.
[03:46.920 --> 03:47.920]  I will try to remember.
[03:47.920 --> 03:49.480]  There's a link to Mike's Patreon in the video description.
[03:49.480 --> 03:50.480]  There you go.
[03:50.480 --> 03:51.480]  That was for me, you guys.
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.400]  Also, it kind of programmed you to go support Mike on Patreon.
[03:54.400 --> 03:56.040]  Thanks you guys for the Patreon support.
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.040]  Check this out.
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.040]  This is one of the rare opportunities I'll be able to do this.
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.240]  I'm on a Zoom video using my MacBook for the camera.
[04:02.240 --> 04:03.320]  So look, Patreon.
[04:03.320 --> 04:04.720]  I've got two cameras.
[04:04.720 --> 04:06.800]  Thank you, you guys.
[04:06.800 --> 04:07.800]  Multicam stuff is coming.
[04:07.800 --> 04:10.720]  Editing multicams is going to be fun, but there you go.
[04:10.720 --> 04:11.720]  Multicam stuff.
[04:11.720 --> 04:12.720]  It's a project for later this week, folks.
[04:12.720 --> 04:13.720]  Yes.
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.120]  Multicam is coming.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.820]  Thank you, Patreon, for making that happen.
[04:17.720 --> 04:18.720]  That's your fault, you guys.
[04:18.720 --> 04:19.720]  Thank you.
[04:19.720 --> 04:20.720]  Multicam.
[04:20.720 --> 04:21.720]  I'm excited about it.
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.820]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:23.820 --> 04:27.980]  Also, you notice I'm rocking the grow from your heart podcast official t-shirt.
[04:27.980 --> 04:30.900]  Hit the iReed genetics website, iReedgenetics.com.
[04:30.900 --> 04:33.120]  There's an iReed genetics store.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.120]  Hit that.
[04:34.120 --> 04:35.120]  You can grab the shirts.
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.120]  There's a link there.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.060]  If you go to the website and sign up to the newsletter, there is a newsletter spot.
[04:40.060 --> 04:41.060]  You'll find it.
[04:41.060 --> 04:42.060]  It's easy.
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.060]  Put in your email address, hit send.
[04:43.060 --> 04:44.820]  It'll sign you up for my newsletter.
[04:44.820 --> 04:48.820]  Once a month, I will send you a coupon code for the Etsy store, perhaps a coupon code
[04:48.820 --> 04:50.980]  for a new vendor.
[04:50.980 --> 04:51.980]  Just special deals and stuff.
[04:51.980 --> 04:54.020]  I try not to spam you too hard with the newsletter.
[04:54.020 --> 04:58.060]  I try to go once a month, maybe every two weeks if there's something worth talking about,
[04:58.060 --> 05:00.820]  but you'll get a coupon code, save a couple of bucks.
[05:00.820 --> 05:01.820]  That's always really helpful.
[05:01.820 --> 05:05.420]  I feel like I'm advertising too much and rambling here at the start of the show.
[05:05.420 --> 05:06.940]  There is a point to this podcast.
[05:06.940 --> 05:07.940]  I did mention that.
[05:07.940 --> 05:09.500]  We do have a serious topic.
[05:09.500 --> 05:10.500]  Yes.
[05:10.500 --> 05:11.500]  There are a lot of rules changing.
[05:11.500 --> 05:13.140]  They changed some rules here in Colorado.
[05:13.140 --> 05:17.300]  Before I hit that part, I did have a couple of more bullet points.
[05:17.300 --> 05:19.260]  There are a lot of new legal states coming online.
[05:19.260 --> 05:21.500]  Mike mentioned that in the pre-ramble.
[05:21.500 --> 05:24.900]  Pre-ramble is such a good word, like a preamble, but it's the pre-ramble.
[05:24.900 --> 05:26.140]  I just made that up.
[05:26.140 --> 05:29.940]  In our pre-ramble, we talked about new states coming online.
[05:29.940 --> 05:33.480]  Virginia, I think Mike said, shout out to Guru.
[05:33.480 --> 05:37.460]  If Virginia is now legal, big up to Guru.
[05:37.460 --> 05:41.580]  As soon as you said it, it didn't sound right in my ear, so I'm going to check it again.
[05:41.580 --> 05:42.940]  I think you might be correct.
[05:42.940 --> 05:44.380]  It's one of those places.
[05:44.380 --> 05:46.940]  But New Mexico is definitely legal now.
[05:46.940 --> 05:52.020]  New Mexico had some controversy because they had a...
[05:52.020 --> 05:53.380]  Basically I don't remember the letters of it.
[05:53.380 --> 05:55.780]  They have a New Mexico medical marijuana program.
[05:55.780 --> 05:58.900]  A couple of my friends just got their medical marijuana cards renewed, and they paid big
[05:58.900 --> 06:01.220]  money to get certain plant counts and do all this stuff.
[06:01.220 --> 06:05.020]  Now they're allowed to grow so much product legally because the state of Colorado or New
[06:05.020 --> 06:06.620]  Mexico made these rules.
[06:06.620 --> 06:08.820]  Today, those rules changed on the first.
[06:09.060 --> 06:12.620]  All that money that my friend paid for his card to be valid for the next 18 months is
[06:12.620 --> 06:13.660]  no longer valid.
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.460]  He's trying to find some recourse with the state of New Mexico, and New Mexico is telling
[06:17.460 --> 06:18.460]  him to go fuck himself.
[06:18.460 --> 06:20.700]  That's going to be interesting.
[06:20.700 --> 06:25.700]  What I'm getting at in the long rambles here is just because your location may have gone
[06:25.700 --> 06:32.260]  legal doesn't mean that you can walk out in the streets with your bong and do bong rips
[06:32.260 --> 06:33.260]  for prosperity.
[06:33.260 --> 06:35.460]  There are so many rules.
[06:35.460 --> 06:37.540]  Yeah, there are so many rules.
[06:37.540 --> 06:46.260]  It's your responsibility, unfortunately, to know them before you go partake or participate.
[06:46.260 --> 06:49.420]  Don't be told the rules.
[06:49.420 --> 06:51.460]  Know them before you break them.
[06:51.460 --> 06:53.420]  Some of them are not intuitive.
[06:53.420 --> 06:55.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:55.080 --> 06:59.340]  Just because it's legal where you are doesn't mean that you can go taking bong rips in the
[06:59.340 --> 07:00.340]  streets.
[07:00.340 --> 07:02.020]  You can smoke joints in the car.
[07:02.020 --> 07:04.940]  Find out the rules and regulations where you are.
[07:05.900 --> 07:10.580]  If the thing was voted on today and it passed today, people think we can dab in the streets
[07:10.580 --> 07:11.580]  today.
[07:11.580 --> 07:13.500]  No, you got to wait for it to actually go into play.
[07:13.500 --> 07:14.860]  It's going to take a little time.
[07:14.860 --> 07:16.980]  Yeah, it's not just like, hey, we could dab now.
[07:16.980 --> 07:19.300]  It's like, nope, nope, we got to pass.
[07:19.300 --> 07:20.300]  The rule passed.
[07:20.300 --> 07:23.180]  Now, you got to make, there's a buffer time that you got to wait for.
[07:23.180 --> 07:24.300]  I love the excitement.
[07:24.300 --> 07:25.820]  I love the enthusiasm.
[07:25.820 --> 07:31.820]  I love all of that stuff, but be careful.
[07:32.300 --> 07:37.260]  Think that just because it's legal, you can overdo yourself and then end up in trouble.
[07:37.260 --> 07:40.140]  When I'm going somewhere else, I went to another state just recently.
[07:40.140 --> 07:42.520]  I went to another place to go visit and have a good time.
[07:42.520 --> 07:47.100]  Before I went there, I Googled the rules around cannabis because I knew the people I was going
[07:47.100 --> 07:49.940]  with, there was going to be cannabis in my group.
[07:49.940 --> 07:53.700]  I knew that somehow, someway, when I got there, there would be cannabis products involved
[07:53.700 --> 07:55.340]  and I knew we would be consuming cannabis.
[07:55.340 --> 08:00.580]  I Googled possession laws, possession limits, what happens if I get caught with concentrates,
[08:00.580 --> 08:03.020]  what happens if I get caught with concentrate gear?
[08:03.020 --> 08:07.620]  What if I have a rig and a torch and a carb cap and dabs in the car?
[08:07.620 --> 08:09.580]  What are my opportunities here?
[08:09.580 --> 08:16.780]  You can buy stuff in a store in Colorado that will get you years in prison in nearby states.
[08:16.780 --> 08:17.780]  Oh, Mike.
[08:17.780 --> 08:20.940]  You guys, I'm going to talk over Mike for a moment.
[08:20.940 --> 08:24.540]  Mike's connection cut out, so I'm just going to talk for a moment and let him catch up.
[08:24.540 --> 08:25.540]  Mike can't hear me.
[08:25.540 --> 08:29.140]  He's giving me the ear signals, but you guys, I'm just going to ramble till Mike's connection
[08:29.140 --> 08:30.140]  catches up.
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.980]  I hope he understands what's going on by now.
[08:31.980 --> 08:38.100]  The point is we could buy stuff here in Colorado and if I drive to Kansas, there we go.
[08:38.100 --> 08:39.100]  Mike is back.
[08:39.100 --> 08:40.100]  Yeah, Mike, you made a very good point, brother.
[08:40.100 --> 08:45.300]  I could buy some stuff here at a dispensary 30 miles from the Kansas border and drive
[08:45.300 --> 08:46.300]  that 30 miles.
[08:46.300 --> 08:49.740]  And as soon as I hit that fucking border, boom, I'm fucked.
[08:49.740 --> 08:55.180]  And there are so many state troopers waiting at the Utah border, the Kansas border.
[08:55.180 --> 08:56.180]  What's the one North?
[08:56.180 --> 08:57.180]  Wyoming.
[08:57.180 --> 08:59.020]  New Mexico doesn't have any fucking cops.
[08:59.020 --> 09:00.340]  So they're not sitting there waiting for you.
[09:00.340 --> 09:03.300]  You got to get a little bit more South, but no, honestly, you guys, there are some cops
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.300]  in New Mexico.
[09:04.300 --> 09:06.740]  A friendly medical marijuana state.
[09:06.740 --> 09:09.020]  Now they're recreational, brother.
[09:09.020 --> 09:10.020]  Today they are recreational.
[09:10.020 --> 09:11.020]  With reciprocity.
[09:11.020 --> 09:14.380]  Yeah, and they just went wreck.
[09:14.380 --> 09:20.940]  But Texas is the big one that I always think of because a grandma hash in Colorado is just
[09:20.940 --> 09:22.460]  a fucking good time.
[09:22.460 --> 09:27.860]  A grandma hash in Texas is hard drugs that your ass is going to prison for.
[09:27.860 --> 09:29.460]  The fucked up part about Texas.
[09:29.460 --> 09:32.700]  Well, I mean, the one of the many Texas, I love you.
[09:32.700 --> 09:33.700]  I pick on Texas a lot.
[09:33.700 --> 09:34.700]  I love you guys.
[09:34.700 --> 09:35.700]  I love you guys.
[09:35.700 --> 09:36.700]  Nothing but love for Texas.
[09:36.700 --> 09:38.580]  Shout out to Hempire Dave.
[09:38.580 --> 09:40.540]  One of the fucked up things about Texas.
[09:40.540 --> 09:43.080]  So this is my Green Dot Labs concentrate container.
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.180]  This was a jar of fat.
[09:44.180 --> 09:49.460]  So number two, I just scooped the last dab out of here for me in this jar.
[09:49.460 --> 09:52.860]  You could see there's for the people just listening.
[09:52.860 --> 09:54.220]  There are remnants.
[09:54.220 --> 09:57.760]  Like if I were a residue.
[09:58.660 --> 10:02.200]  If I were a youngster and I were fucking scrounging up for concentrates, I could get two or three
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.760]  of these jars and scrape that out of there.
[10:03.760 --> 10:04.760]  I could get a dab.
[10:04.760 --> 10:07.020]  I could definitely make a dab out of that.
[10:07.020 --> 10:10.520]  In years past when things weren't the way they should be, I've been known to fucking
[10:10.520 --> 10:11.520]  pull a couple jars out.
[10:11.520 --> 10:13.800]  I know there's a dab fucking in all of these and scrape them together.
[10:13.800 --> 10:14.800]  That's happened.
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.060]  I guess that's the old school.
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.880]  This is the new school version of scraping your fucking pipe.
[10:17.880 --> 10:19.840]  Let me scrape all my jars.
[10:19.840 --> 10:28.960]  In Texas, I would be charged with the weight of this jar and its lid, which this is a glass
[10:28.960 --> 10:31.700]  jar with a big dense plastic lid.
[10:31.700 --> 10:33.480]  This is at least an ounce.
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.400]  I would be charged with an ounce of concentrate because of this container.
[10:36.400 --> 10:39.160]  Any concentrate is in the same legal classification as meth and heroin.
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.840]  I'm going to drop it on the table and you can hear how damn heavy it is.
[10:42.840 --> 10:44.740]  You really need to know the rules, people.
[10:44.740 --> 10:49.200]  That's the tangent we're on is it is incredibly important to know the rules where you're playing.
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.720]  In Texas, they charge you for your container weight.
[10:51.720 --> 10:54.040]  If you got some shit in Texas, carry a parchment paper.
[10:54.040 --> 10:56.320]  That way it's lighter.
[10:56.320 --> 10:57.320]  Just don't fuck around in Texas.
[10:57.320 --> 10:58.320]  That's my legal.
[10:58.320 --> 11:00.640]  As your lawyer, I highly advise you don't fuck around in Texas.
[11:00.640 --> 11:01.640]  Behave yourself.
[11:01.640 --> 11:02.640]  All right.
[11:02.640 --> 11:04.920]  Know the rules where you are.
[11:04.920 --> 11:07.400]  It doesn't mean you can dab in the streets.
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.400]  That was my point here.
[11:08.400 --> 11:09.400]  I don't want people getting in trouble.
[11:09.400 --> 11:11.360]  People are like, hey, I can grow a bunch of weed now.
[11:11.360 --> 11:12.360]  Maybe.
[11:12.360 --> 11:13.360]  Be careful.
[11:13.360 --> 11:18.400]  The one that fucked everybody here was you can't grow weed in your backyard.
[11:18.600 --> 11:21.800]  It feels like you should be able to, but you definitely can't.
[11:21.800 --> 11:24.000]  I want to kind of segue.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.080]  We're going to get to the topic here, but I saw somebody post a picture the other day
[11:28.080 --> 11:32.600]  of their outdoor grow and there were like 24 plants in their outdoor Colorado grow.
[11:32.600 --> 11:33.760]  Hey guys, be careful.
[11:33.760 --> 11:37.600]  Your limit is six, maybe 12 if you've got medical credentials.
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.800]  No, you don't have credentials or medical recommendations.
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.400]  Two adults in a house, you can legally grow 12.
[11:44.400 --> 11:45.400]  Yeah.
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.400]  So 12.
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.960]  If it's a single adult property and only one person's getting mail there and you don't
[11:51.960 --> 11:54.640]  have a medical card, the limit's six.
[11:54.640 --> 11:55.640]  Do not.
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.360]  Which you can have up to 12 with you and a wife is what they're thinking.
[11:59.360 --> 12:02.960]  So do not post a photo of 13 plants.
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.440]  That's my advice.
[12:04.440 --> 12:06.880]  Post a picture of 11 plants.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.560]  Like don't even, yeah.
[12:08.560 --> 12:09.560]  Yep.
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.560]  Yeah.
[12:10.560 --> 12:11.560]  That's some of my friends out there.
[12:11.560 --> 12:18.080]  I mean, federally, like triple think about posting period because the powers that be
[12:18.080 --> 12:21.560]  still like to fuck with us any way they can because it can't.
[12:21.560 --> 12:22.560]  Yes.
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.560]  Yeah.
[12:23.560 --> 12:24.560]  Depending on your location, definitely a double, triple thinker.
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.120]  Even here in Colorado, it can fuck with your child custody cases.
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.720]  It can fuck with your job.
[12:29.720 --> 12:31.160]  It can fuck with your livelihood.
[12:31.160 --> 12:32.160]  Your banking.
[12:32.160 --> 12:33.160]  In a number of different ways.
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.160]  Your banking.
[12:34.160 --> 12:40.840]  I mean, there's sort of no end to the list of ways we have come up with to screw with
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.440]  people in an attempt to get them to not smoke weed.
[12:46.440 --> 12:54.680]  And during legalization, even here in Colorado where we really started legalization, there's
[12:54.680 --> 13:02.960]  just no attempt yet to go back and go, we shouldn't fuck with people's schools, school
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.280]  funding options because they got caught with pot or we shouldn't kick them out of federal
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.040]  housing because they're smoking pot or test positive.
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.840]  We shouldn't take them off transplant lists or threat to take their children away.
[13:18.840 --> 13:21.640]  All those things still happen even here.
[13:21.640 --> 13:22.640]  Yeah.
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.800]  So not to be Debbie Downer on the show, but that's kind of what we're playing.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.240]  So you can play safe.
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.440]  We know that's your role, Mike.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.000]  We know that's what you brought.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.400]  Every party needs a pooper.
[13:32.400 --> 13:33.400]  Yeah.
[13:33.400 --> 13:34.400]  This is Colorado.
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.040]  You can grow, consume.
[13:37.040 --> 13:38.800]  You can open up a fucking storefront.
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.480]  You can advertise on the radio, but there's nowhere really legal to go smoke.
[13:42.480 --> 13:44.640]  So you got to go home.
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.640]  I totally checked.
[13:45.640 --> 13:47.240]  Virginia did go legal.
[13:47.240 --> 13:49.040]  Nice shot to Virginia.
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.800]  The headline said it was squirrelly and you should read the article to understand it.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.800]  So do that.
[13:53.800 --> 13:54.800]  I didn't.
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.120]  I think it's funny that they said squirrelly in an article.
[13:59.120 --> 14:00.120]  That's awesome.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.800]  Oh, well, shit.
[14:01.800 --> 14:05.520]  I was hoping the reporter said the word squirrelly reporter Mike with the word squirrelly on
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.520]  the scene.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.600]  We have rambled for a long fucking time.
[14:08.600 --> 14:10.900]  We've promised the people a podcast here.
[14:10.900 --> 14:14.000]  There may be an editor seven to happen into this.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.360]  Mike, there are some new rules happening in Colorado that are going to affect myself and
[14:20.360 --> 14:21.360]  possibly you.
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.880]  You don't shop as heavily as I do, but this may affect me and you in the future.
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.520]  Affect myself.
[14:28.520 --> 14:34.640]  The people who wrote the bill that we're talking about hope it affects everybody.
[14:34.640 --> 14:36.600]  That's their goal.
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.400]  So the bill we're talking about, if you'd like to read along at home listeners, you
[14:41.400 --> 14:42.400]  can look it up.
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.400]  It's Colorado.
[14:43.400 --> 14:50.800]  So you can Google this by just typing the capital letters C for Colorado and then HB
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.600]  for house bill and 1317 is the serial number.
[14:55.600 --> 15:02.760]  So C O HB 1317.
[15:02.880 --> 15:09.000]  It's designed as a bill to add restrictions and regulations to Colorado's medical marijuana
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.120]  program and marijuana concentrates.
[15:13.120 --> 15:18.400]  The anti-cannabis powers that be around the country and here in Colorado have learned
[15:18.400 --> 15:27.160]  that the only two talking points they have that anyone still gives a fuck about are marijuana
[15:27.160 --> 15:32.600]  is way stronger now than it was in the 60s and you should be afraid of that.
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.960]  And teenagers getting ahold of cannabis is especially bad now because it's super strong
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.920]  like we told you about a minute ago.
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.600]  Longtime listeners of this show will know that I have rambled at length repeatedly about
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.760]  what nonsense both of those talking points are and I'm happy to do so again in a future
[15:52.760 --> 15:55.520]  show.
[15:55.520 --> 16:02.280]  So anyway, house bill 1317 with those two talking points in mind made its way through
[16:02.280 --> 16:09.840]  the Colorado legislature and was signed into law about a week ago by Governor Polis.
[16:09.840 --> 16:13.800]  Most of the stuff I'm going to be talking about takes place immediately or whenever
[16:13.800 --> 16:22.520]  they can figure out how to do it because some of it's not immediately possible in Colorado.
[16:22.520 --> 16:29.640]  So under the new law, they're changing medical marijuana rules, especially for people under
[16:29.640 --> 16:31.540]  the age of 21.
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.980]  So right now before this bill in Colorado, you can be a medical marijuana patient at
[16:36.980 --> 16:39.740]  any age.
[16:39.740 --> 16:47.580]  If you're 21 or over, you just go to one doctor, often a doctor that specializes in medical
[16:47.580 --> 16:49.100]  marijuana.
[16:49.100 --> 16:53.700]  You talk to that doctor in a doctor's appointment, they fill out your paperwork, you send your
[16:53.700 --> 17:00.780]  paperwork into the state, you get a thing back on your phone now, it's very easy.
[17:00.860 --> 17:03.700]  And that's all it takes to get your medical marijuana card.
[17:03.700 --> 17:05.660]  I believe that's 18 and over.
[17:05.660 --> 17:06.820]  Yeah, 18 and up.
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.820]  I'm sorry.
[17:07.820 --> 17:08.820]  Yes, sir.
[17:08.820 --> 17:14.180]  And there's a different group under 18 where you needed two doctors to sign off on your
[17:14.180 --> 17:15.540]  card.
[17:15.540 --> 17:20.580]  And most medical marijuana doctors didn't want anything to do with you.
[17:20.580 --> 17:25.560]  So there was this middle group of people who were 18 to 21 who were too young to shop in
[17:25.560 --> 17:33.640]  rec stores, but old enough to shop in medical stores who would get medical marijuana cards.
[17:33.640 --> 17:40.800]  And the bill supposes a large number of those people were then retail selling cannabis they
[17:40.800 --> 17:48.320]  purchased with their medical card and cannabis concentrates to their high school friends.
[17:48.400 --> 17:57.160]  And so they've come up with new rules requiring anyone under 21 to go see two marijuana doctors
[17:57.160 --> 18:03.520]  or not two marijuana doctors, two doctors to sign their marijuana paperwork.
[18:03.520 --> 18:09.080]  They've implemented a couple of other rules that the physicians will have to meet, like
[18:09.080 --> 18:17.640]  reviewing previous doctor's records, recommending dosage and potency limits, especially for
[18:17.720 --> 18:19.960]  patients under 21.
[18:19.960 --> 18:21.200]  My video is frozen.
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.640]  Your video is frozen.
[18:22.640 --> 18:23.680]  You sound perfect.
[18:23.680 --> 18:24.680]  You just now froze.
[18:24.680 --> 18:25.680]  Okay.
[18:25.680 --> 18:28.920]  As long as you guys, as long as you still get my audio, but I was blowing out my dad.
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.600]  You just came right back to us blowing out my dad.
[18:30.600 --> 18:33.200]  And I looked and I was like, is he frozen or am I that high?
[18:33.200 --> 18:34.200]  That works.
[18:34.200 --> 18:36.840]  I needed to take a breath anyway.
[18:36.840 --> 18:37.840]  So they're doing great.
[18:37.840 --> 18:45.640]  They make it a lot harder for under 18 year olds to purchase cannabis concentrates.
[18:45.640 --> 18:51.000]  One of the other things that freaked them out was recreational patients can only buy
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.160]  eight grams of concentrates a day.
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.840]  Medical patients could buy 40.
[18:56.840 --> 18:59.120]  I was surprised to learn that the number is 40.
[18:59.120 --> 19:05.080]  I was pretty sure it was like 50 something because 28 plus 28 and that's where the limit
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.080]  comes from.
[19:06.080 --> 19:07.800]  You know, I've been at a shop that sells me 56.
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.480]  Yeah, the limit should be 56 by the law, but all of the articles that I've read recently
[19:13.480 --> 19:16.640]  have specified the old limit was 40.
[19:16.640 --> 19:17.640]  Huh?
[19:17.640 --> 19:19.880]  I was getting 56 at one spot.
[19:19.880 --> 19:21.280]  Shout out to that place.
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.600]  That should have been the limit the way I understand the way the law is written.
[19:25.600 --> 19:29.600]  It's just literally 15 news articles in a row said the old limit was 40.
[19:29.600 --> 19:32.880]  I think the bill language even says the old limit was 40.
[19:32.880 --> 19:33.880]  Wow.
[19:33.880 --> 19:38.520]  But it's pretty clear by one of the other provisions in this bill that people that understand
[19:38.520 --> 19:44.640]  Colorado's marijuana laws and work kind of inside them were not involved really.
[19:44.640 --> 19:51.720]  This is a bill written by anti-cannabis people and people they've managed to scare.
[19:51.720 --> 19:56.880]  So they're requiring under 21 year olds to go to two doctors.
[19:56.880 --> 20:03.560]  They've made it really hard to be a cannabis doctor only.
[20:03.560 --> 20:08.320]  They're trying to push so that anyone with a medical marijuana card is getting that from
[20:08.320 --> 20:14.800]  their primary care physician or if they're under 18, a primary care physician and a recommended
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.280]  specialist that already has access to their whole medical history.
[20:18.280 --> 20:19.280]  Wow.
[20:19.280 --> 20:22.800]  Because again, this I really need to stress this listeners.
[20:22.800 --> 20:29.220]  This bill is not meant to do good or to make better or to improve.
[20:29.220 --> 20:34.440]  It is meant to hamper, hinder and destroy.
[20:34.440 --> 20:41.040]  Explicitly, the people behind this are gleeful on Facebook over the death blow they've served
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.280]  Colorado's medical marijuana program.
[20:44.280 --> 20:51.080]  This bill started out as a potency cap at 15%.
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.920]  We'll get to that in a second.
[20:52.920 --> 20:56.280]  So if you're under 21, you've got to go see two doctors.
[20:56.280 --> 20:59.800]  They made it way harder to be a medical marijuana doctor in Colorado.
[20:59.800 --> 21:03.040]  They're probably going to get incredibly scarce as well.
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.840]  And we're slowly going to start seeing other physicians who don't specialize in cannabis
[21:08.840 --> 21:16.680]  being forced to learn and catch up with the rest of us and then fill the gap that's created
[21:16.680 --> 21:21.600]  when the medical marijuana doctors start disappearing.
[21:21.600 --> 21:28.380]  It changes the purchase limits for medical marijuana period down to eight grams of concentrates
[21:28.380 --> 21:29.620]  per day.
[21:29.640 --> 21:38.320]  If you're under 21, so you're between 18 and 21, because if your parents are shopping for
[21:38.320 --> 21:42.840]  you, if you're under 18 and you can't go into the building, I believe those people could
[21:42.840 --> 21:46.460]  still get full eight grams of concentrates.
[21:46.460 --> 21:53.160]  But if you're between the ages of 18 and 21, you'll be limited to just two per day.
[21:53.160 --> 22:00.720]  So if you're an 18 year old with stomach cancer who's using concentrates as medicine,
[22:00.720 --> 22:04.460]  your life just got real fucking shitty.
[22:04.460 --> 22:05.460]  There's no other way to say it.
[22:05.460 --> 22:11.460]  You can't imagine if you had to fill your prescription medicine in a day or two or three
[22:11.460 --> 22:12.460]  or four days.
[22:12.460 --> 22:17.300]  If you had to go to the pharmacy six times a month to get your medicine and have stomach
[22:17.300 --> 22:21.440]  cancer at the same time, it's super unfunctional.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.440]  And that's the point.
[22:22.720 --> 22:26.240]  They want to make it hard and unfunctional.
[22:26.240 --> 22:28.640]  So those are the main changes to medical marijuana.
[22:28.640 --> 22:34.520]  They also want to, one of the big ones that I almost just forgot, bad mic.
[22:34.520 --> 22:37.920]  They're going to set up a statewide medical marijuana tracking system.
[22:37.920 --> 22:38.920]  Yeah, I was going to ask about that.
[22:38.920 --> 22:45.660]  So they want to add a function to our tracking system metric that tracks cannabis product
[22:45.820 --> 22:52.900]  from its seed stage or clone stage through moving out into the consumer world.
[22:52.900 --> 22:57.580]  So they track it to the dispensary and then as the dispensary sells it, there's just a
[22:57.580 --> 23:02.860]  form that says they sold that pound of weed, three and a half grams at a time all day long
[23:02.860 --> 23:04.580]  until it was gone.
[23:04.580 --> 23:10.040]  They want it set up so that it marks that Jeff bought three grams on Monday and three
[23:10.040 --> 23:11.560]  more grams on Wednesday.
[23:11.560 --> 23:16.240]  And I came in on Tuesday and bought four grams and then seven grams on Sunday.
[23:16.240 --> 23:23.160]  They want it all specific to the patient so that the state registry will kick out an error
[23:23.160 --> 23:32.480]  at a retail level if an 18 to 21 year old tries to store hop and buy more than two grams
[23:32.480 --> 23:34.680]  per day.
[23:34.680 --> 23:43.600]  They also want it set up so that the doctor's recommendation of you should have X amount
[23:43.600 --> 23:47.920]  of cannabis per dose, X amount of doses per day.
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.200]  So like when your other stuff, it's in milligrams.
[23:51.200 --> 23:57.560]  So 50 milligrams in the morning by mouth with food or whatever, or three times a day with
[23:57.560 --> 23:59.460]  just water.
[23:59.460 --> 24:03.040]  They want the same thing with marijuana or cannabis medicine.
[24:03.040 --> 24:07.320]  And they also want a potency attachment too, because one of the theories they've built
[24:07.320 --> 24:14.520]  into the bill is that the higher the potency number, the more problematic it becomes consumption
[24:14.520 --> 24:17.760]  consequence wise.
[24:17.760 --> 24:25.720]  The people behind this bill have an operating theory that cannabis concentrates cause schizophrenia.
[24:25.720 --> 24:28.440]  So like these aren't sane people.
[24:28.440 --> 24:33.480]  A lot of them are very tragic figures.
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.920]  I can get into that too, but I kind of want to stay focused on the bill before I get too
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.120]  slowed off and too ADD'd off into the corner.
[24:43.120 --> 24:45.960]  So that's the medical marijuana stuff.
[24:45.960 --> 24:50.720]  The tracking program, super unfeasible right now.
[24:50.720 --> 24:54.000]  The last time I worked with Metric, Metric was not capable of doing that.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.300]  It was barely capable of doing what we're asking it to do.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.100]  It was not getting it to track retail enough so that the state database knows how many
[25:03.100 --> 25:07.620]  grams of medical marijuana everybody bought last week is going to be really complicated.
[25:07.620 --> 25:09.660]  There's another state that actually does that.
[25:09.660 --> 25:11.100]  They used to, they don't anymore.
[25:11.100 --> 25:14.460]  They just changed that system to the, I think so.
[25:14.460 --> 25:17.860]  But they used to go by units and you were allowed so many units per month and the state
[25:17.860 --> 25:20.660]  would know how many units you have and it would be in your computer.
[25:20.660 --> 25:24.100]  As you shop, just like you would say, Mike's got a hundred units and you'd buy whatever
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.300]  and then it would take it out of your units.
[25:26.300 --> 25:27.300]  Yeah.
[25:27.300 --> 25:31.060]  Like a concentrate would be two units and a flower gram would be a unit or whatever.
[25:31.060 --> 25:33.540]  I don't know how they broke it down.
[25:33.540 --> 25:38.220]  The folks behind this bill really hoped this would kill medical.
[25:38.220 --> 25:44.220]  And I think that's a big reason they don't have any sort of tracking system for reg or
[25:44.220 --> 25:45.500]  for recreational.
[25:45.500 --> 25:51.260]  It's just specifically targeted on the med program.
[25:51.260 --> 25:52.780]  They're making it harder on doctors.
[25:52.780 --> 25:54.340]  They're making it harder on dispensaries.
[25:54.340 --> 25:56.460]  They're making it harder on med grows.
[25:56.460 --> 26:01.100]  The whole point is to squeeze the medical industry until it just shutters.
[26:01.100 --> 26:07.900]  And Colorado just has a recreational industry because people needing cannabis medicine is
[26:07.900 --> 26:11.100]  bulletproof politically.
[26:11.100 --> 26:14.340]  It's got support in the seventies and eighties.
[26:14.340 --> 26:15.340]  Yeah.
[26:16.340 --> 26:24.900]  Anyone who spent any time working in or around marijuana knows its healing potential.
[26:24.900 --> 26:31.780]  Sanjay Gupta is an incredible example of staunch prohibitionist who worked against us, spending
[26:31.780 --> 26:38.420]  time near us and having his eyes open wide to the point where he was a major advocate
[26:38.420 --> 26:43.140]  for years with those weed specials on CNN.
[26:43.140 --> 26:47.500]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, please Google Sanjay Gupta weed specials.
[26:47.500 --> 26:50.780]  It's four or five hours of wonderful television.
[26:50.780 --> 26:55.460]  If you're unfamiliar with medical marijuana, those will get you all caught up.
[26:55.460 --> 26:59.100]  So some other parts of this bill.
[26:59.100 --> 27:05.580]  Limiting medical purchasing down from 40 grams a day to eight is pretty brutal for a lot
[27:05.580 --> 27:08.740]  of med patients.
[27:08.740 --> 27:18.180]  It also sets money aside to study cannabis potency because you can't just give people
[27:18.180 --> 27:20.860]  concentrates and see what happens to them.
[27:20.860 --> 27:26.340]  That'd be wildly unethical according to modern psychology and modern medical studies and
[27:26.340 --> 27:30.580]  the DEA and NIDA won't allow it.
[27:30.580 --> 27:38.820]  So the odds that this money is used for actual research is zero or maybe 1%.
[27:38.820 --> 27:44.500]  So they'll probably pull articles and just compile the findings from other articles where
[27:44.500 --> 27:46.780]  they tried to look at this.
[27:46.780 --> 27:51.740]  Nobody's really done the research, which is funny because the original marijuana research
[27:51.740 --> 27:56.300]  where they discovered the THC and CBD molecule was done with hashish.
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.060]  And the researcher has a lovely story about going to the police station and picking up
[28:00.060 --> 28:05.160]  confiscated kilos and then riding on a public bus back to the lab with them.
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.460]  So hashish and concentrates have been part of marijuana research since the first day
[28:09.460 --> 28:10.980]  we started researching it.
[28:10.980 --> 28:15.700]  Mike, what if we try to transport some medical concentrates on the bus now?
[28:15.700 --> 28:17.700]  Like, hey, Mike, I'm just going to run this pound of concentrate.
[28:17.700 --> 28:22.460]  I would laugh really hard putting that in the directions portion of a manifest.
[28:22.460 --> 28:23.460]  That'd be so funny.
[28:23.460 --> 28:24.460]  Walk to bus stop.
[28:24.460 --> 28:25.460]  Get on bus 117.
[28:25.620 --> 28:28.620]  Ride to stop 74.
[28:28.620 --> 28:31.180]  Hey, you guys that work metric, I want to know if this works for you.
[28:31.180 --> 28:33.220]  I saw somebody in the directions.
[28:33.220 --> 28:34.220]  It said planned route.
[28:34.220 --> 28:39.320]  It said quickest possible route or most logical route or something like that.
[28:39.320 --> 28:41.260]  And they just type that as their whole travel guide.
[28:41.260 --> 28:45.100]  So that was my go-to for the last year I did manifests.
[28:45.100 --> 28:46.100]  Really?
[28:46.100 --> 28:47.100]  Did it work for you?
[28:47.100 --> 28:48.100]  I never had anybody complain.
[28:48.100 --> 28:49.420]  No, you're not in jail.
[28:49.420 --> 28:50.420]  So that works.
[28:50.420 --> 28:52.300]  My favorite thing, I submitted my MED badge.
[28:52.300 --> 28:55.300]  And there's a thing that when you submit it, it says, hey, just because you're submitting
[28:56.140 --> 28:58.900]  your badge doesn't mean you're relinquished of any crimes you may have committed while
[28:58.900 --> 28:59.900]  you had this badge.
[28:59.900 --> 29:00.900]  Yeah, it doesn't mean you're unguilty.
[29:00.900 --> 29:01.900]  That shit is so funny.
[29:01.900 --> 29:05.860]  Yeah, this isn't like you didn't just hit safe by fucking tapping out of a game.
[29:05.860 --> 29:06.860]  You could still be fucked.
[29:06.860 --> 29:08.620]  That was a great clause.
[29:08.620 --> 29:10.140]  They made sure I signed that little stipulation.
[29:10.140 --> 29:12.740]  I was like, yeah, I just need this because other stuff.
[29:12.740 --> 29:13.740]  No worries.
[29:13.740 --> 29:15.340]  All right, Mike.
[29:15.340 --> 29:18.140]  So they're going to limit our concentrate purchases.
[29:18.140 --> 29:24.100]  I want to ask, do you think that this is just going to send people to the black market,
[29:24.100 --> 29:25.100]  the free market?
[29:25.900 --> 29:26.900]  I'm sorry, though.
[29:26.900 --> 29:27.900]  What is it?
[29:27.900 --> 29:28.900]  There are so many words for it.
[29:28.900 --> 29:30.500]  I still say black market.
[29:30.500 --> 29:37.620]  I get that the cannabis market is such a weird space and the history of it is super interesting.
[29:37.620 --> 29:44.980]  And so it's very different than other illicit markets.
[29:44.980 --> 29:50.700]  In the late 90s, in the time when we were really involved, it was small home grows and
[29:50.700 --> 29:53.860]  friends and associates.
[29:53.860 --> 29:56.700]  And that's a reason that there weren't a lot of bodies.
[29:56.700 --> 30:02.900]  You know, like we just stopped being friends when somebody fucked up or we just didn't
[30:02.900 --> 30:07.060]  like that guy or maybe somebody got beat up, you know, like there weren't major shootouts
[30:07.060 --> 30:11.900]  over turf and shit.
[30:11.900 --> 30:16.240]  But it never fully went away.
[30:16.240 --> 30:18.940]  It just stopped having a point here in Colorado.
[30:19.700 --> 30:20.900]  It's just so easy to hit the dispensary.
[30:20.900 --> 30:21.900]  I don't have to call anybody.
[30:21.900 --> 30:25.220]  I don't have to arrange anything.
[30:25.220 --> 30:33.380]  The odds that what we grew up in has a major resurgence here is pretty slim.
[30:33.380 --> 30:39.540]  I think what's likely to happen is it's going to squeeze medical to death.
[30:39.540 --> 30:45.300]  And so there's going to be a slow turnover of all of the places that have med and rec
[30:45.420 --> 30:49.420]  are slowly going to convert their med to more rec.
[30:49.420 --> 30:55.260]  And the places that just have med are going to be desperate as fuck to convert to rec
[30:55.260 --> 31:07.020]  because med still, I'm 99% sure, requires patient signups for plant counts.
[31:07.020 --> 31:13.260]  My medical program function knowledge is a little rusty because I'm not even a med card
[31:13.260 --> 31:17.740]  holder for the first time in like 15 years right now because I've been so damn busy.
[31:17.740 --> 31:21.660]  Shit, I haven't even been on the show.
[31:21.660 --> 31:26.380]  So I've even let my med card lapse, but I'm 99% sure medical dispensaries here still need
[31:26.380 --> 31:31.900]  patients to sign up with them so that they can have a plant limit and grow it in their
[31:31.900 --> 31:41.620]  grow and when med medical marijuana doctors vanish, they're going to be way hard up for
[31:41.620 --> 31:47.620]  patients starting in a few months because patient numbers drop off every month.
[31:47.620 --> 31:53.340]  So this bill was designed to kill medical and it's probably going to do it.
[31:53.340 --> 31:57.180]  I was really surprised with how little the industry pushed back on this.
[31:57.180 --> 32:03.860]  As soon as they got the potency cap pushed to a potency study, they sat out the rest
[32:03.860 --> 32:05.420]  of the fight, which sucks.
[32:05.420 --> 32:08.260]  I didn't hear much about it.
[32:08.260 --> 32:11.420]  I hear a lot about a lot of these things and this one was kind of quiet.
[32:12.220 --> 32:19.540]  The couple of times I brought it up because there was a packaging requirement that was
[32:19.540 --> 32:25.140]  tied to this where they were going to have all cannabis concentrates had to be sold in
[32:25.140 --> 32:31.460]  one tenth of a gram containers, which would mean you could still go buy your eight grams,
[32:31.460 --> 32:36.420]  but instead of eight jars, you would have to buy 80 jars or they would have to figure
[32:36.580 --> 32:43.580]  out a way to divvy up what's inside the jar into 10 set easily identifiable segments.
[32:43.580 --> 32:48.420]  That got cut out, thank God, through an amendment.
[32:48.420 --> 32:57.380]  But instead they inserted like $3 million in funding for an educational campaign to
[32:57.380 --> 33:04.780]  talk to youth about extracted THC, another million a year to keep that program going
[33:04.820 --> 33:16.500]  through 2024, another $2 million for one of the local universities to research cannabis
[33:16.500 --> 33:24.500]  potency and the effects of potent cannabis products on humans, another $1.7 million to
[33:24.500 --> 33:34.860]  create a reporting system for coroners to report all violent deaths.
[33:34.860 --> 33:41.220]  So anything but died of old age, they want a tox screen run and those results reported
[33:41.220 --> 33:47.300]  to a statewide database because the people behind this bill are 100% sure that if you
[33:47.300 --> 33:54.020]  smoke cannabis, you commit suicide later, especially if you're dabbing.
[33:54.020 --> 33:57.980]  They write books about it, they go to conferences where they tell each other about it.
[33:57.980 --> 34:04.220]  I mean, it's I smoked a gram of concentrates while we've been sitting here on zoom.
[34:04.220 --> 34:07.100]  We've been on zoom for much longer than we've been recording this podcast.
[34:07.100 --> 34:08.860]  I've consumed a gram.
[34:08.860 --> 34:09.860]  This jar is empty.
[34:09.860 --> 34:10.860]  I showed the jar.
[34:10.860 --> 34:13.260]  I kind of want to go something I've never done on a podcast on my show.
[34:13.260 --> 34:14.540]  I've done it as a guest.
[34:14.540 --> 34:19.700]  I want to get up and go to my concentrate location and acquire another jar.
[34:19.700 --> 34:24.820]  And I have no desire to hurt myself or other people.
[34:24.820 --> 34:26.460]  It's fucking shenanigans.
[34:26.460 --> 34:27.740]  It's bullshit is what that is.
[34:27.740 --> 34:29.300]  It's fucking stupid.
[34:29.300 --> 34:37.740]  So between the ages of 12 and 30, all of the crazy happens.
[34:37.740 --> 34:42.200]  And like, that's when you leave the house for the first time.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.380]  That's when you discover who you are as a person.
[34:45.220 --> 34:46.220]  That's where you go on.
[34:46.220 --> 34:48.260]  Fuck, I can't believe we live through that kind of shit, bro.
[34:48.260 --> 34:50.460]  Type adventures.
[34:50.460 --> 34:53.540]  That's the and then the van started rolling type.
[34:53.540 --> 34:54.540]  That's the age group.
[34:54.540 --> 34:55.540]  Yeah.
[34:55.540 --> 35:02.980]  And if you look at all of the metrics, like that age group dies young the most like in
[35:02.980 --> 35:04.340]  that window.
[35:04.340 --> 35:05.620]  It's not 40 year olds.
[35:05.620 --> 35:06.780]  It's not 10 year olds.
[35:06.780 --> 35:11.420]  It's like 16 to 30.
[35:11.420 --> 35:14.480]  That's also when mental illness appears.
[35:14.480 --> 35:24.620]  That's also when other disorders like anxiety, bipolar, opposite defiant, those can really
[35:24.620 --> 35:28.660]  come to a head in the late teens, early 20s.
[35:28.660 --> 35:35.820]  And the other thing that happens then is you start experimenting with narcotics and alcohol,
[35:35.820 --> 35:38.060]  tobacco, pot.
[35:38.060 --> 35:40.780]  Those are the big three sex drugs and rock and roll, man.
[35:41.140 --> 35:47.540]  It's just not the same if you don't do all three.
[35:47.540 --> 35:49.540]  But got to go fast for a large part.
[35:49.540 --> 35:53.500]  The people behind this bill and the people that make up the anti-cannabis movement are
[35:53.500 --> 36:03.740]  people who had loved ones who died young and were using cannabis to some extent before
[36:03.740 --> 36:04.940]  they died.
[36:04.940 --> 36:10.060]  Some of these people were clearly experiencing mental illness.
[36:10.060 --> 36:15.300]  One of the things that you learn when you study depression and mental illness and psychology
[36:15.300 --> 36:23.460]  is that when people are in a state of mental anguish or anxiety, depression, you self-medicate
[36:23.460 --> 36:26.820]  with anything you get your hands on.
[36:26.820 --> 36:32.100]  And anyone who's known someone with mental illness or depression, especially when that
[36:32.100 --> 36:39.140]  was emerging in them, they self-medicate wildly because you think, oh, I'm not depressed.
[36:39.220 --> 36:40.220]  I'm tired.
[36:40.220 --> 36:41.220]  So you drink a lot.
[36:41.220 --> 36:42.780]  You start abusing caffeine.
[36:42.780 --> 36:44.620]  The caffeine starts taking its toll.
[36:44.620 --> 36:50.540]  So you start smoking pot or drinking at night to take the edge off so you can unwind.
[36:50.540 --> 36:55.420]  And that tends to make mental illness worse.
[36:55.420 --> 37:02.220]  And so there's definitely a cycle that can start when a young person starts suffering
[37:02.220 --> 37:07.100]  and starts self-medicating and then eventually commits suicide.
[37:07.100 --> 37:12.220]  And if you look at it objectively from the outside, you can see that, oh, it's not an
[37:12.220 --> 37:15.740]  A leads to B leads to C thing.
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.660]  It was all depression.
[37:17.660 --> 37:21.460]  And all of the steps you're seeing aren't steps.
[37:21.460 --> 37:23.220]  They're not dominoes.
[37:23.220 --> 37:27.260]  They're symptoms that all come from the middle thing.
[37:27.260 --> 37:32.220]  And when you're up close, all you see is the loss.
[37:33.220 --> 37:38.380]  And when we were kids, these people would, yeah, you seek to place blame.
[37:38.380 --> 37:43.420]  And when we were kids, these people ended up to some extent going from middle school
[37:43.420 --> 37:49.460]  to middle school to tell you not to smoke crack or whatever it was of the day.
[37:49.460 --> 37:50.460]  Don't drink.
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.460]  My kid died in a drunk driving accident.
[37:52.460 --> 37:53.460]  Don't do coke.
[37:53.460 --> 37:56.140]  My kid died coked out in a car accident.
[37:56.140 --> 37:57.340]  Don't do heroin.
[37:57.340 --> 38:02.100]  My favorite son who was a wrestler and a star athlete died of heroin.
[38:02.100 --> 38:09.660]  Now they have online anti-pot groups that they can get whatever from.
[38:09.660 --> 38:16.220]  These groups have been throwing everything they can at the wall trying to see what sticks.
[38:16.220 --> 38:21.140]  And the only two things that get any traction with anybody anymore are the potency argument
[38:21.140 --> 38:23.780]  and the think about the kids argument.
[38:23.780 --> 38:24.780]  Save the children.
[38:24.780 --> 38:25.780]  Yeah.
[38:25.780 --> 38:30.260]  And I mean, I was really disgusted to see that this gained traction.
[38:30.420 --> 38:34.220]  I was horrified when it got all the sponsors it got.
[38:34.220 --> 38:41.180]  I was horrified with how quickly it moved through the Colorado House and Senate.
[38:41.180 --> 38:45.060]  Jerry Polis is incredibly pro-cannabis.
[38:45.060 --> 38:49.900]  Had a big signing event where the people behind this bill went to the governor's mansion and
[38:49.900 --> 38:54.340]  hung out around him at the signing table while he signed it and then got to take home the
[38:54.340 --> 38:57.060]  ceremonial pens and shit.
[38:58.060 --> 39:02.860]  Some of that's just the pomp and circumstance that goes with bill signing.
[39:02.860 --> 39:04.660]  Ceremonial pens.
[39:04.660 --> 39:05.900]  That's just like.
[39:05.900 --> 39:11.580]  A lot of times they just five of them get signed and you read about it in the news the
[39:11.580 --> 39:12.580]  next day.
[39:12.580 --> 39:14.420]  These five bills got signed into law.
[39:14.420 --> 39:15.780]  Here's what they do.
[39:15.780 --> 39:16.860]  There's no ceremony.
[39:16.860 --> 39:18.620]  There's no ceremonial pens.
[39:18.620 --> 39:23.340]  There's just the process being fulfilled legally.
[39:23.340 --> 39:27.780]  And so the fact that there was a signing ceremony and ceremonial pens was disturbing
[39:27.780 --> 39:33.980]  in its own right because that pomp and circumstance isn't necessarily standard, even though it
[39:33.980 --> 39:35.700]  is common.
[39:35.700 --> 39:42.820]  And to see a pro-cannabis governor sign an anti-cannabis bill that's only thinly veiled
[39:42.820 --> 39:44.660]  as a regulation bill was pretty ugly.
[39:44.660 --> 39:46.140]  Did we just lose video again?
[39:46.140 --> 39:47.940]  I saw you glitch and then wave.
[39:47.940 --> 39:48.940]  You're back.
[39:48.940 --> 39:49.940]  Good audio?
[39:49.940 --> 39:50.940]  Yeah.
[39:50.940 --> 39:51.940]  The audio was beautiful.
[39:51.940 --> 39:52.940]  So you're back.
[39:53.540 --> 39:54.540]  Yeah.
[39:54.540 --> 39:55.540]  I'm recording on a backup source as well.
[39:55.540 --> 39:56.540]  So I'm thinking trying to do this right.
[39:56.540 --> 39:57.540]  Yeah.
[39:57.540 --> 39:59.540]  I always thought that dude was on our team.
[39:59.540 --> 40:02.020]  And then when I read what he had done, I was like, wait, what?
[40:02.020 --> 40:04.300]  But yeah, he did a couple other things that confused me, too.
[40:04.300 --> 40:06.980]  So I don't even want to talk too much about politics.
[40:06.980 --> 40:12.060]  I don't know enough, but I feel like I learned certain people because they represent us.
[40:12.060 --> 40:16.180]  I'm scrolling through the article on the Westward here just to make sure I'm hitting all the
[40:16.180 --> 40:17.180]  points I need to.
[40:17.180 --> 40:21.420]  And the paragraph right here is the recreational marijuana industry has stayed largely neutral
[40:21.420 --> 40:24.460]  or silent on the bill.
[40:24.460 --> 40:28.340]  The medical marijuana community, which means actual community members, or they would have
[40:28.340 --> 40:33.220]  said industry, voiced the loudest resistance.
[40:33.220 --> 40:37.500]  Over 100 medical marijuana doctors sent an opposition letter to the governor asking him
[40:37.500 --> 40:40.460]  to veto.
[40:40.460 --> 40:45.100]  I don't think the governor's veto would have done anything because it looks like they really
[40:45.100 --> 40:48.500]  did have the votes to force it through regardless.
[40:48.500 --> 40:51.940]  That's rough.
[40:51.940 --> 41:00.220]  This sets up a couple of studies that because of the limitations in the policy and law,
[41:00.220 --> 41:06.360]  the study can only conclude that concentrates are scary and we don't know enough.
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.380]  And I think that's going to be enough for them to try to push concentrates out of the
[41:10.380 --> 41:15.300]  rec market in two years.
[41:15.300 --> 41:21.580]  The people behind these bills, their goal is to cripple and to destroy.
[41:21.580 --> 41:26.580]  And they know that they can't, like if they just ran a straight up, let's repeal amendment
[41:26.580 --> 41:31.780]  64 and go back to prohibition, that they would get laughed out of the fucking state.
[41:31.780 --> 41:37.780]  Like maybe not even laughed, maybe run that on a rail.
[41:37.780 --> 41:44.500]  But they found ways where they can get in on the side conversation and they can bleed
[41:44.500 --> 41:45.940]  us dry.
[41:45.940 --> 41:52.700]  And one of them was let's keep adding taxes until there's no money left to pay the people.
[41:52.700 --> 41:57.540]  And they got real close to doing it that way and got stuck.
[41:57.540 --> 41:59.740]  Yeah, there's so many taxes.
[41:59.740 --> 42:00.740]  Yep.
[42:00.740 --> 42:03.380]  They came up with the let's do the potency bill.
[42:03.380 --> 42:08.220]  And two or three years ago, we were able to just, we hired all of the petition circulating
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.540]  companies and we made sure they were otherwise occupied.
[42:12.580 --> 42:17.940]  And the anti-pop people were just straight up about the fact that they didn't have a
[42:17.940 --> 42:25.460]  broad enough coalition to support to get the signatures anyway without a hired company.
[42:25.460 --> 42:31.300]  And then this year, they found a way to get the legislators to push it forward through
[42:31.300 --> 42:34.380]  them so they didn't need any signatures.
[42:34.380 --> 42:40.140]  They got a couple of sponsors to take their language and tweak it a little bit and throw
[42:40.140 --> 42:41.140]  it forward.
[42:41.220 --> 42:44.620]  And the original bill would have killed the concentrate industry completely.
[42:44.620 --> 42:45.620]  Yeah.
[42:45.620 --> 42:46.620]  Completely.
[42:46.620 --> 42:47.620]  Yeah.
[42:47.620 --> 42:48.620]  Things you were telling me the past-
[42:48.620 --> 42:49.620]  It would have shut the industry down for a couple of years.
[42:49.620 --> 42:51.660]  Some of the things you said the past few months had me worried.
[42:51.660 --> 42:55.900]  I was clutching my dab rig going, hey, wait, but what are they going to do with my dabs?
[42:55.900 --> 42:56.900]  Yep.
[42:56.900 --> 42:59.780]  And we're in one of those weird fluxes.
[42:59.780 --> 43:08.180]  Historically, society makes a bunch of progress and things get newer and better and more interesting.
[43:08.220 --> 43:13.620]  And then a period of conflict happens like an 18-month pandemic that shut everything
[43:13.620 --> 43:18.940]  down and then things go conservative for a while.
[43:18.940 --> 43:24.260]  Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's 10 years.
[43:24.260 --> 43:28.220]  And it usually the pendulum swings the other way for a bit.
[43:28.220 --> 43:34.980]  You can go back and pull some like WAP level lyrics from the 1930s because the 20s and
[43:34.980 --> 43:40.620]  the 30s had a big sexual revolution that was so far repressed, they had to fucking
[43:40.620 --> 43:45.140]  reinvent that shit in the 60s.
[43:45.140 --> 43:49.300]  Mike's over here making WAP references a couple of months late, but I'm still impressed.
[43:49.300 --> 43:51.740]  Life's different.
[43:51.740 --> 43:56.460]  It's just, this feels like something we're going to backslide on.
[43:56.460 --> 44:03.700]  And I really need the community to give a shit about this because it's not a good thing.
[44:03.700 --> 44:08.620]  The powers that be are pissed that they can't take away our voting rights because we like
[44:08.620 --> 44:09.780]  cannabis.
[44:09.780 --> 44:13.620]  They're pissed that they can't take away our property because we like cannabis.
[44:13.620 --> 44:20.580]  They're really pissed that we've made an industry out of buying, selling, growing, and consuming
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.060]  cannabis.
[44:22.060 --> 44:26.660]  And if they can find a way to put the genie back in the bottle and go back to kicking
[44:26.660 --> 44:32.980]  doors in because you might have a quarter ounce of weed in the table, they're gonna.
[44:32.980 --> 44:33.980]  And we can't let them.
[44:33.980 --> 44:38.740]  And this is them trying the best they know how right now to backslide.
[44:38.740 --> 44:44.980]  If you get online and look for like Project Sam or Smart Approaches to Marijuana, talking
[44:44.980 --> 44:50.020]  about this bill in Colorado, their language is explicit.
[44:50.020 --> 44:53.500]  Colorado's experiment with legalization has failed.
[44:53.500 --> 44:55.260]  Full stop.
[44:55.260 --> 45:01.060]  Proof of that is this regulation bill where we're finally going to hold those evil marijuana
[45:01.060 --> 45:02.620]  people accountable.
[45:03.260 --> 45:06.460]  And we finally fought and hard won regulations.
[45:06.460 --> 45:09.580]  They act like we don't have any rules.
[45:09.580 --> 45:13.020]  They act like it's people growing it in their basement and selling it on street corners
[45:13.020 --> 45:14.020]  to toddlers.
[45:14.020 --> 45:15.020]  It's insane.
[45:15.020 --> 45:20.740]  And they get away with it because people like me have two kids now and we don't make it
[45:20.740 --> 45:21.740]  to all the meetings anymore.
[45:21.740 --> 45:22.740]  Right.
[45:22.740 --> 45:26.500]  And I'm over here running a podcast and not doing my job, I guess.
[45:26.500 --> 45:28.780]  So Mike, how do we start wrapping up?
[45:28.780 --> 45:30.780]  Because we've been going for long enough.
[45:30.780 --> 45:36.260]  How do we make sure that shit doesn't happen like this to us in the future here in Colorado,
[45:36.260 --> 45:40.620]  but in places where they are working on legalization and building their foundation?
[45:40.620 --> 45:43.800]  How did we miss this and how do we make sure stuff like this doesn't keep happening and
[45:43.800 --> 45:44.800]  what can we do?
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.140]  I want to get some final moments from some some Mike's minutes, if you will.
[45:48.140 --> 45:53.620]  I think this happened because the industry grew complacent.
[45:53.620 --> 45:58.620]  Part of our legal industry has chased people like me out because we're annoying.
[45:59.460 --> 46:03.420]  We remind the boss that federal law says breaks are a fucking thing.
[46:03.420 --> 46:06.020]  We call the boss when it's 105 degrees in the building.
[46:06.020 --> 46:10.580]  And you tell me, hey, buddy, you're driving too fast with all the dabbering in the cup
[46:10.580 --> 46:11.580]  holder.
[46:11.580 --> 46:12.580]  You're that guy.
[46:12.580 --> 46:14.240]  That's why that's why we call him white Mike, you guys.
[46:14.240 --> 46:18.620]  That's his fucking job.
[46:18.620 --> 46:23.180]  I like the boss don't like it when you tell him you won't skirt the law for the same amount
[46:23.180 --> 46:24.180]  of money.
[46:24.180 --> 46:25.540]  They just don't like it.
[46:25.540 --> 46:27.860]  They don't like it when you call them on the shit.
[46:28.220 --> 46:33.700]  That's what advocates do is we see something that's wrong and it pisses us off and we stand
[46:33.700 --> 46:35.580]  up and speak about it.
[46:35.580 --> 46:37.420]  And it's it takes a lot of work.
[46:37.420 --> 46:38.820]  It takes a lot of dedication.
[46:38.820 --> 46:42.380]  It takes an endless amount of study and reading.
[46:42.380 --> 46:47.220]  I mean, just knowing this bill was a thing, you have to at least check the news regularly
[46:47.220 --> 46:49.300]  or you wouldn't even heard about it.
[46:49.300 --> 46:53.020]  Yeah, I wouldn't have known without you.
[46:53.020 --> 46:59.340]  When I asked when the packaging requirement for hash still said concentrates had to be
[46:59.340 --> 47:04.260]  served in tenth of a gram containers, when that was still direct language in the bill,
[47:04.260 --> 47:06.900]  I asked around every time I was in a shop.
[47:06.900 --> 47:09.500]  Do you all hear about the regulation bill?
[47:09.500 --> 47:10.500]  No.
[47:10.500 --> 47:11.500]  What do you mean?
[47:11.500 --> 47:12.580]  Oh, it's really fucked up.
[47:12.580 --> 47:13.580]  You should learn about it.
[47:13.580 --> 47:16.180]  One of the things is they're going to require packaging.
[47:16.180 --> 47:18.200]  Oh, they wouldn't do that.
[47:18.200 --> 47:20.180]  That doesn't make any sense.
[47:20.180 --> 47:21.180]  That would hurt us.
[47:21.180 --> 47:22.620]  They wouldn't do that.
[47:22.620 --> 47:30.740]  That was the take everywhere and getting people to understand that the world don't like us.
[47:30.740 --> 47:35.220]  Matter of fact, most of them grew up sitting in circle talking about how much they ought
[47:35.220 --> 47:41.340]  to hate us, to shun us, to chase us out of the room.
[47:41.340 --> 47:46.420]  There's still companies that are big, mad that we all smoke weed now.
[47:46.420 --> 47:51.280]  And if they want us to pass a drug test, they're going to have to pay us a lot because we'll
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.720]  take a more shitty job because we get to smoke weed there.
[47:56.720 --> 47:58.760]  Not add the job, but I mean, you were allowed afterwards.
[47:58.760 --> 47:59.760]  Yeah.
[47:59.760 --> 48:02.320]  Like, we shouldn't tell you what to do at home.
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.720]  As soon as the boss starts talking to you about what to do in your off hours, it's time
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.720]  to find a new boss.
[48:06.720 --> 48:07.720]  Yep.
[48:07.720 --> 48:08.720]  That's the truth.
[48:08.720 --> 48:10.140]  Or create a job of your own.
[48:10.140 --> 48:13.400]  And they don't like that they've lost that bit of control.
[48:13.400 --> 48:19.560]  And a lot of industries have their hands tied because in the full prohibition days, we used
[48:19.560 --> 48:25.640]  to pay people to think up ways to try to convince me and Jeff not to smoke weed.
[48:25.640 --> 48:31.840]  And so they were like, you can't ever hold a license operating heavy equipment or driving
[48:31.840 --> 48:41.400]  a truck or using a forklift or working in like the meatpacking industry.
[48:41.400 --> 48:46.880]  Like they get all those fucking people have to get drug tested constantly.
[48:46.880 --> 48:53.160]  The fast food employees and they got insurance companies to give the companies big discounts
[48:53.160 --> 48:55.600]  if they would just drug test their employees.
[48:55.600 --> 49:01.080]  And so one by one, all of these industries got a little thumb on their neck saying we've
[49:01.080 --> 49:03.160]  got a drug test.
[49:03.160 --> 49:09.440]  And places like Colorado, the company's forced to choose between eating that insurance discount
[49:09.440 --> 49:15.040]  or drug testing their people and not having a workforce.
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.840]  People got to stay vigilant and stay on top of this stuff.
[49:17.840 --> 49:21.080]  And we really need to start electing better people.
[49:21.080 --> 49:23.800]  Holy fuck.
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.600]  Predictably the sponsors of this bill, one of the main sponsors is a pediatrician, a
[49:29.600 --> 49:30.600]  pediatrician.
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.320]  And she's talking about 18 year olds cannabis habits.
[49:36.320 --> 49:37.320]  She's a pediatrician.
[49:37.320 --> 49:38.320]  Yeah.
[49:38.320 --> 49:40.000]  What do you think her take on this is?
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.680]  Do you think her patients are honest with her?
[49:42.680 --> 49:45.080]  Do you think 18 year olds are honest with their doctor?
[49:45.080 --> 49:46.080]  I fucking wasn't.
[49:46.080 --> 49:47.080]  Right.
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.840]  Doctors like you smell like cigarettes and I can see them on the floor over there where
[49:49.840 --> 49:50.840]  they thought your pants.
[49:50.840 --> 49:51.840]  You sure you don't smoke?
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.280]  Yeah, I don't smoke, dog.
[49:54.280 --> 49:57.240]  I certainly don't smoke weed, doc.
[49:57.240 --> 50:00.320]  You'll tell my mom I can't have her now.
[50:00.320 --> 50:01.320]  Yeah.
[50:01.320 --> 50:03.320]  Like it's just ridiculous.
[50:03.320 --> 50:07.840]  And then they fearmonger this shit in and it's really going to fuck with the industry.
[50:07.840 --> 50:15.400]  The potency study, it's set up in this bill so that a commission is formed to do the study
[50:15.400 --> 50:24.520]  and then whatever recommendations they make, the MED and the Department of Revenue have
[50:24.520 --> 50:27.680]  to figure out how to make them a rule.
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.160]  And so if they come back saying our research shows that anything above 15 percent THC is
[50:33.760 --> 50:40.000]  considered a hard drug, which if they just Google where does the Netherlands stop caring
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.360]  about cannabis, I think it's 15 percent THC.
[50:43.360 --> 50:44.360]  Oh, wow.
[50:44.360 --> 50:53.920]  And all of a sudden we've got that rule here where anything above 15 percent is a no go.
[50:53.920 --> 50:55.120]  That could happen in other states.
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.920]  I think there's one state on the East Coast that has a potency gap already.
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.000]  I think it's 60 percent for concentrates.
[51:03.840 --> 51:06.600]  So what if you make a concentrate that's over 60 percent?
[51:06.600 --> 51:07.600]  What do you do?
[51:07.600 --> 51:08.600]  You got to throw some other shit in there?
[51:08.600 --> 51:09.600]  That's the...
[51:09.600 --> 51:10.600]  With what though?
[51:10.600 --> 51:11.600]  Yeah, right.
[51:11.600 --> 51:14.440]  I don't even want to know what.
[51:14.440 --> 51:15.440]  That's gross.
[51:15.440 --> 51:16.440]  All right.
[51:16.440 --> 51:20.520]  Like I said, I was going to give you a Mike's moment and I gave you like an hour and a half.
[51:20.520 --> 51:21.520]  20 minutes.
[51:21.520 --> 51:23.000]  Yeah, I knew that's what I was going to get out of you.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.200]  We were going to try to wrap this up half an hour, folks.
[51:26.200 --> 51:27.640]  Thanks for listening to the rambles, folks.
[51:27.640 --> 51:28.720]  We appreciate it.
[51:28.720 --> 51:29.720]  Thank you for being on the show.
[51:29.720 --> 51:33.640]  Also, bro, you were saying how much dedication, reading time and energy it takes to be an
[51:33.640 --> 51:34.640]  advocate.
[51:34.640 --> 51:35.640]  Thank you, bro.
[51:35.640 --> 51:37.640]  Because without you laying all that groundwork, I wouldn't be able to do...
[51:37.640 --> 51:39.760]  I wouldn't be able to put the fucking seeds in it.
[51:39.760 --> 51:41.440]  That's the greatest way I could put it.
[51:41.440 --> 51:42.440]  So thank you, bro.
[51:42.440 --> 51:43.440]  We need you out there.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.440]  We need more guys like you out there doing it.
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.800]  So you guys, if you are curious on how to be active, how to get involved in the political
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.960]  side, not everybody's a grower, not everybody's a podcaster.
[51:51.960 --> 51:56.400]  If you want to do some behind the scenes work and get legalization going where you are,
[51:56.400 --> 51:57.400]  get it going.
[51:57.400 --> 51:58.400]  Contact Mikey.
[51:58.400 --> 51:59.680]  He will help you out, teach you how to do all that stuff.
[51:59.680 --> 52:01.080]  Give you some tips and tricks.
[52:01.080 --> 52:03.520]  He's a busy dude, but he will respond to you.
[52:03.520 --> 52:04.680]  I do promise that.
[52:04.680 --> 52:09.440]  And you can totally stay anonymous doing this also.
[52:09.440 --> 52:17.080]  It's harder, but in none of my advocacy has anyone ever checked my ID.
[52:17.080 --> 52:23.400]  So you could fully be any sort of pen name you want, as long as it's believable.
[52:23.400 --> 52:27.680]  And letters to the editor have a lot of weight to them.
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.560]  The powers that be still really like newspapers and they don't have an ability to check who's
[52:32.560 --> 52:34.560]  at the end of the email either.
[52:34.560 --> 52:37.680]  So you just submit an email, go to Outlook.
[52:37.680 --> 52:43.360]  You can create a new Outlook email in about four seconds and you can be anybody you want
[52:43.360 --> 52:45.240]  to be.
[52:45.240 --> 52:48.480]  Just the more people speaking out, the better it is for everybody.
[52:48.480 --> 52:49.960]  Mike is feeding the trolls.
[52:49.960 --> 52:50.960]  Yeah.
[52:50.960 --> 52:51.960]  Yeah.
[52:51.960 --> 52:52.960]  The more people, the better.
[52:52.960 --> 52:53.960]  That's definitely it.
[52:53.960 --> 52:54.960]  We need more.
[52:54.960 --> 52:56.680]  So there are a lot of people that are sitting around smoking, listening to the show, loving
[52:56.680 --> 52:57.680]  the show.
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.440]  Send an email.
[52:59.440 --> 53:03.240]  If you're working on some sort of legalization where you live, send an email.
[53:03.240 --> 53:04.240]  All right.
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.280]  We've done enough with the political talking about sending emails and stuff.
[53:06.280 --> 53:08.520]  Mike, I want to thank you for hanging out, bro.
[53:08.520 --> 53:11.600]  I need to go get some more concentrates out of my concentrate supply.
[53:11.600 --> 53:15.020]  It is time for us to bro out for a few minutes and just talk off camera here.
[53:15.020 --> 53:16.880]  You don't get enough time to adult and hang out.
[53:16.880 --> 53:20.360]  So we're going to abuse some of that privilege.
[53:20.360 --> 53:21.360]  Thank you again for hanging out, bro.
[53:21.360 --> 53:24.760]  Do you want to remind people how to stalk you on social media just because they all
[53:24.760 --> 53:28.480]  have ADD and they already forgot what you said at the start of the show?
[53:28.480 --> 53:32.040]  You can find me at Twitter at Nemopunk15.

[53:53.880 --> 53:56.160]  I hope I'm still recording all of that because it was fucking smooth.
