[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  I'm your host.
[00:08.000 --> 00:14.560]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 642 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:14.560 --> 00:18.120]  In this episode, I'm going to recap an event I recently attended.
[00:18.120 --> 00:21.040]  Then I want to talk a little bit about storing our seeds.
[00:21.040 --> 00:24.340]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks who support
[00:24.340 --> 00:26.160]  the show on Patreon.
[00:26.160 --> 00:29.960]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.000]  Nicholas A. Let's send a big thank you shout out to Canna Reaper and Froggle Rock.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.560]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Crazy Hand Grows and Riven Waters.
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.120]  Let's send a big fist bump to Thomas McGinnis and Lefty's Farm.
[00:40.120 --> 00:44.000]  I want to send a thank you shout out to the big sexy Dank and the Bafsta.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.280]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Pac Northwest Dan and Stash Drop.
[00:47.280 --> 00:50.640]  And then let's wrap up the shout outs with a big thank you shout out to my friend, the
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.320]  new old guy.
[00:52.320 --> 00:56.940]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[00:56.940 --> 01:00.520]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:00.520 --> 01:06.520]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.

[01:08.800 --> 01:12.640]  And of course, there is a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.400]  super easy for all of my friends.
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.840]  Once again, really thank you for all of the continued Patreon support.
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.680]  Also thank you everybody for the feedback from the last two episodes.
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.840]  The last two episodes were very video intensive.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.640]  I pulled some plants out of the garden.
[01:29.640 --> 01:32.920]  I put gloves on and went hands on with the plants.
[01:32.920 --> 01:33.920]  Cut some plants up.
[01:33.920 --> 01:35.760]  In one episode, we did some popping and twisting.
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.600]  In another episode, I cut some clones.
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.200]  I showed you guys how to get those clones all the way to in their cups and their starting
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.600]  homes.
[01:43.600 --> 01:44.680]  Thank you for all of the feedback.
[01:44.680 --> 01:46.240]  I got a lot of feedback.
[01:46.240 --> 01:49.240]  Those are two of my most watched videos already.
[01:49.240 --> 01:50.960]  Most commented on videos.
[01:50.960 --> 01:51.960]  Most praised videos.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.960]  Thank you.
[01:52.960 --> 01:53.960]  I do appreciate that.
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.600]  If you are listening to this show on an audio service, I do highly recommend that you go

[02:10.720 --> 02:12.400]  I do appreciate that.
[02:12.400 --> 02:14.760]  Where do we go from there?
[02:14.760 --> 02:15.760]  Thank you guys.
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.760]  I do appreciate that.
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.200]  All the comments, all the feedback.
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.200]  That is wonderful.
[02:19.200 --> 02:22.200]  Let's move right into talking about, oh, I want to mention one thing.
[02:22.200 --> 02:27.400]  A lot of the audio podcast services have been messed up.
[02:27.400 --> 02:29.280]  Long story short, my website got messed up.
[02:29.280 --> 02:31.080]  You don't care about the details.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.840]  A service provider changed a thing.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.320]  It messed up all of my things.
[02:34.320 --> 02:35.560]  Things got weird.
[02:35.560 --> 02:39.180]  My web guy is working diligently to solve the problems.
[02:39.180 --> 02:41.480]  We don't know that there is a problem until somebody tells us.
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.040]  I didn't know that the show wasn't on Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Spotify.
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.880]  It wasn't showing up in a lot of places.
[02:47.880 --> 02:50.040]  We are working to correct that.
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.200]  It should be corrected by the time this episode comes out.
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.640]  The thing is, every time we correct one thing, we find that something else is messed up.
[02:56.640 --> 02:58.480]  We're playing the fix the internet game.
[02:58.480 --> 03:00.320]  I do apologize if you've missed episodes.
[03:00.320 --> 03:01.840]  I did not mean to abandon you.
[03:01.840 --> 03:03.040]  I didn't ditch you.
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.560]  I am struggling just like you.
[03:05.560 --> 03:08.400]  Just like you want to listen to the shows, I want them to be available.
[03:08.400 --> 03:09.400]  Trust me.
[03:09.400 --> 03:10.560]  Sponsors pay for it.
[03:10.560 --> 03:12.920]  Patreon relies on the shows coming out.
[03:12.920 --> 03:14.780]  I do want the shows to come out on time.
[03:14.780 --> 03:19.020]  If the show is not on the service which you are used to, I recommend checking YouTube.
[03:19.020 --> 03:21.740]  YouTube seems to be fairly reliable most of the time.
[03:21.740 --> 03:22.980]  I put the shows up.
[03:22.980 --> 03:26.140]  It is 12 o'clock Sunday night into Monday morning.
[03:26.140 --> 03:28.980]  Then again, 12 o'clock Wednesday into Thursday morning.
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.100]  I do premieres on YouTube.
[03:30.100 --> 03:32.460]  I actually hang out and watch the video with you guys.
[03:32.460 --> 03:33.460]  Hang out in the chat.
[03:33.460 --> 03:35.300]  Talk shit in the chat room.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.300]  Join us for that.
[03:36.300 --> 03:38.580]  If you're missing something, please do find us on YouTube.
[03:38.580 --> 03:42.240]  However, I'm just realizing that if you're not finding the show, you're not even going
[03:42.240 --> 03:43.240]  to get the message.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.960]  I'm calling somebody who left their phone at your house.
[03:44.960 --> 03:46.120]  Hey bro, your phone's at my house.
[03:46.120 --> 03:48.160]  The phone is just ringing on my table.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.280]  All right.
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.920]  Let's move forward into something useful in this podcast.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.320]  I recently attended a great event.
[03:54.320 --> 03:59.800]  I attended the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed Exchange event in Denver, Colorado.
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.880]  That was a beautiful event.
[04:00.880 --> 04:01.880]  We had a great time.
[04:01.880 --> 04:03.520]  It was a low-key event.
[04:03.520 --> 04:04.520]  It was kind of low-key.
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.720]  I would guess there were somewhere between 300 and 500 people at the whole event, which
[04:08.720 --> 04:09.720]  was not bad.
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.200]  That was great for ... I was kind of calling it a practice.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.160]  I was calling it a practice run, like getting back into the environment, re-entry.
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.800]  I haven't been to an event, to a concert, to a comedy show, any big sort of gathering
[04:20.800 --> 04:23.800]  since March 12th or 13th.
[04:23.800 --> 04:28.120]  I was at the last comedy show that was at the Comedy Works downtown in Denver.
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.320]  The last show was Bobby Lee.
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.560]  They haven't had a big show in that building since.
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.080]  Then they have now, by the time you hear this, some socially distanced shows.
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.600]  But there haven't been any big shows, events, anything like that for me to go to.
[04:39.600 --> 04:41.040]  It was exciting to get out.
[04:41.040 --> 04:43.040]  This was just a small event.
[04:43.080 --> 04:45.800]  Most of the time I take two or three people to a big event to help me out.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.240]  This time it was Mike and myself.
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.360]  Big shout to Mike for helping me.
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.160]  Kind of a small event, but that was perfect.
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.160]  That's what I'm getting at.
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.920]  I needed a small event for re-entry to learn how to deal with people again, how to be at
[04:55.920 --> 04:56.920]  an event environment.
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.960]  It's been so long that I kind of forgot.
[04:59.960 --> 05:02.160]  Once we got there, we totally fell right into the rhythm, though.
[05:02.160 --> 05:03.480]  It was just like old times.
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.560]  The drive up was super smooth.
[05:05.560 --> 05:11.200]  It's about a three-hour drive from where Mike and I were to actually get to the event.
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.800]  Pretty uneventful drive.
[05:12.840 --> 05:14.120]  We had a good talk on the way up there.
[05:14.120 --> 05:16.200]  Mike and I just had a really good conversation.
[05:16.200 --> 05:17.200]  Probably should have recorded that.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.320]  You guys would have appreciated that.
[05:19.320 --> 05:20.600]  Drive up was smooth.
[05:20.600 --> 05:22.480]  Parking and load in were super smooth.
[05:22.480 --> 05:25.160]  There was a dedicated parking spot for us.
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.880]  Not a spot, but a parking lot.
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.600]  The lot was plenty of spots for us.
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.760]  We can get in there and get a good, clean parking space.
[05:30.760 --> 05:34.800]  I actually dropped Mike off right in front of the event with all of our merchandise,
[05:34.800 --> 05:37.040]  drove over, parked, walked back.
[05:37.040 --> 05:38.040]  Not a big deal.
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.040]  Short walk to get right to the event.
[05:40.040 --> 05:41.040]  Getting in was cool.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.120]  Setting up was cool.
[05:42.160 --> 05:46.240]  The flow of the event was super smooth.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.400]  Let's talk about how the event happened.
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.680]  We got set up.
[05:48.680 --> 05:53.080]  Then about 20 minutes before the doors were going to open, we were told, hey, the VIPs
[05:53.080 --> 05:55.080]  are going to be allowed to enter in just a few minutes.
[05:55.080 --> 05:58.080]  If you need to do anything, now's your chance.
[05:58.080 --> 05:59.440]  Mike got a drink and a snack.
[05:59.440 --> 06:00.520]  I used the men's room.
[06:00.520 --> 06:01.840]  We just got ourselves organized.
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.320]  Then the VIPs were allowed in.
[06:03.320 --> 06:07.200]  VIPs were allowed, I think, to hang out all day.
[06:07.200 --> 06:10.720]  If you bought a VIP ticket for this event, you were included all day.
[06:11.040 --> 06:15.440]  However, after the VIPs, there were time slots.
[06:15.440 --> 06:17.880]  The time slots went from noon to one.
[06:17.880 --> 06:21.120]  Then you were allowed to come in the building with your wristband or with your ticket.
[06:21.120 --> 06:24.920]  You were allowed entry from noon to one to shop at the booths.
[06:24.920 --> 06:28.320]  Then when your time slot was almost up, they would run around and there were a couple of
[06:28.320 --> 06:32.000]  guys just politely saying, hey, there's about 10 minutes left in your time slot.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.440]  Please wrap up your shopping and then head outside when you're done.
[06:34.440 --> 06:36.960]  Once you got done, you could go outside.
[06:36.960 --> 06:38.280]  There were other booths outside.
[06:38.280 --> 06:39.760]  I honestly didn't make it out there.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.640]  There were food trucks.
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.920]  There were a lot of people and a DJ out there I heard.
[06:43.920 --> 06:45.720]  I honestly didn't make it.
[06:45.720 --> 06:49.280]  There was a massage booth out there that people were coming back in and saying, man, that
[06:49.280 --> 06:50.280]  massage was fucking great.
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.800]  So shout out to the massage lady.
[06:53.800 --> 06:57.240]  You would come in, you'd get an hour to shop, and they would politely remind you that your
[06:57.240 --> 07:00.720]  time is up and you'd be escorted out to that back area, which was outside.
[07:00.720 --> 07:03.640]  Once you were outside, you could hang out and socialize and hang out.
[07:03.640 --> 07:05.360]  I don't know if there was consumption happening out there.
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.120]  I almost said you could consume.
[07:07.120 --> 07:09.080]  I don't want to snitch on anybody if that was not allowed.
[07:09.080 --> 07:11.080]  Allegedly, maybe people were smoking out there.
[07:11.080 --> 07:13.680]  So you were allowed one hour to shop, which was kind of cool.
[07:13.680 --> 07:16.680]  There were about 10 booths.
[07:16.680 --> 07:18.560]  I'm going to say 10 to 12-ish booths.
[07:18.560 --> 07:21.360]  I didn't do a real solid head count, obviously.
[07:21.360 --> 07:23.060]  There were about 10 or 12 booths.
[07:23.060 --> 07:25.280]  Most of those booths were breeders.
[07:25.280 --> 07:31.920]  Right in my little section where my booth was set up, it was Oni Seeds in the corner
[07:31.920 --> 07:37.360]  and then myself and then another group that was a seed seller.
[07:37.360 --> 07:40.240]  They were a retailer, so they had a lot of other breeders.
[07:40.240 --> 07:41.800]  They had Kallax Seed Company.
[07:41.800 --> 07:43.640]  They had some of my seeds.
[07:43.640 --> 07:46.440]  They just had seeds from a bunch of other vendors or other breeders over there, and
[07:46.440 --> 07:48.560]  they were a reseller vending other seeds, which is cool.
[07:48.560 --> 07:50.240]  Nothing wrong with that.
[07:50.240 --> 07:54.520]  There was also right across from me, looking straight at their booth all day, was Top Dog.
[07:54.520 --> 07:56.200]  So big shout out to JJ and Top Dog.
[07:56.200 --> 07:57.200]  Also shout out to Oni.
[07:57.200 --> 07:58.720]  Shout out to my booth neighbors to the right.
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.720]  I cannot remember their name.
[07:59.720 --> 08:00.920]  I had it written down on a paper.
[08:00.920 --> 08:03.920]  I'll bring that paper with me.
[08:03.920 --> 08:06.160]  Also down the row was Capulator.
[08:06.160 --> 08:09.560]  Capulator Seeds, and I think it's Rocky Mountain High that he rolls with.
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.560]  That crew was down the way.
[08:10.560 --> 08:13.560]  There were a few other great booths also.
[08:13.560 --> 08:16.320]  Tiki ... See, I wrote it down.
[08:16.320 --> 08:18.000]  I left that paper in another room.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.160]  Tiki something, Tiki Madness, Tiki Maniac, something like that.
[08:21.160 --> 08:22.160]  They seemed cool, good people.
[08:22.160 --> 08:24.080]  They had a lot of traffic at their booth.
[08:24.080 --> 08:26.200]  I think Crop King's new invention.
[08:26.200 --> 08:28.640]  By the way, let's mention that Crop King has changed their name.
[08:28.960 --> 08:32.960]  If you know about Crop King, beware.
[08:32.960 --> 08:34.800]  They've also changed their name to Rocket Seeds.
[08:34.800 --> 08:36.560]  Rocket Seeds is also Crop King Seeds.
[08:36.560 --> 08:37.920]  I do not work with them.
[08:37.920 --> 08:38.920]  I do not support them.
[08:38.920 --> 08:39.920]  I do not endorse them.
[08:39.920 --> 08:42.320]  If they are claiming to have my seeds, that is fraudulent.
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.840]  Be careful where you're buying your seeds from.
[08:43.840 --> 08:45.440]  That's all I need to say about that.
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.800]  But Crop King is also now Rocket Seeds, so buyer beware.
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.800]  I think they were there.
[08:50.800 --> 08:51.800]  They had a booth.
[08:51.800 --> 08:55.400]  I didn't realize who that was until later on when I realized they changed their names.
[08:55.400 --> 08:56.400]  But it was kind of cool.
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.400]  It was a cool setup event.
[08:57.400 --> 08:58.400]  So people got to come in.
[08:59.160 --> 09:02.040]  They got an hour to shop, and then they got moved out to the outside area.
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.040]  It wasn't rude.
[09:03.040 --> 09:04.040]  They knew that they got an hour.
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.400]  So there was from noon to one, got to shop.
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.000]  And then from one to 1.30, it was basically just VIPs in the building.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.720]  And the VIPs have already been to my booth a couple of times.
[09:12.720 --> 09:13.720]  They've shopped.
[09:13.720 --> 09:14.720]  They've chatted.
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.720]  They've gotten their fist bumps.
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.800]  So in that 30-minute break between groups, between waves, that would give us time to
[09:20.800 --> 09:21.800]  just regroup.
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.400]  I could take a drink of water, reorganize my booth, check my phone, use the restroom
[09:25.400 --> 09:29.600]  if I needed to, go get a bagel if I wanted one because they had bagels there for us,
[09:29.600 --> 09:32.200]  go get a coffee if we wanted one, just whatever you needed.
[09:32.200 --> 09:34.120]  You can get like a good 20 or 30-minute break.
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.020]  And that's kind of cool because when I go to an event, I am the Mickey Mouse of my brand.
[09:39.020 --> 09:40.020]  I know that.
[09:40.020 --> 09:41.640]  My face is on the package.
[09:41.640 --> 09:42.640]  People don't come there.
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.640]  No offense, Mike.
[09:43.640 --> 09:44.640]  Nobody came there to talk to Mike.
[09:44.640 --> 09:45.640]  Some people do.
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.160]  But 90% of the people that come to my booth want to talk to me, and that's understandable.
[09:50.160 --> 09:51.960]  So I don't get to leave the booth very often.
[09:51.960 --> 09:54.720]  But when you got a minute break there in the middle, you know that I can just go use the
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.840]  restroom and no one's going to come up to the booth and be disappointed that they didn't
[09:57.840 --> 10:01.720]  get to meet Rasta Jeff because I really do try to meet everybody, try to shake everybody's
[10:01.720 --> 10:05.320]  hands if you want a selfie, a high five, a picture, if you want me to autograph some
[10:05.320 --> 10:10.160]  shit, I'll do it because I understand without the people that support me, I wouldn't be
[10:10.160 --> 10:11.360]  supported.
[10:11.360 --> 10:16.600]  So I'm grateful and thankful and I like to oblige and be cordial to the people who have
[10:16.600 --> 10:17.600]  supported me.
[10:17.600 --> 10:21.800]  I'm successful because of those people, but they're successful with their grows because
[10:21.800 --> 10:22.920]  of what we're giving each other.
[10:22.920 --> 10:24.920]  So it works out.
[10:24.920 --> 10:25.920]  I really like that flow.
[10:25.920 --> 10:26.920]  It was a great time.
[10:26.920 --> 10:27.920]  It was really good.
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.520]  I keep rambling about this event because I was excited.
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.800]  It was good just to be at an event.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.760]  Standing at my booth is just a good feeling.
[10:33.760 --> 10:36.000]  I've got the iReed Genetics flag behind me.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  I've got the banner at the table that says the website and has my face on it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.500]  We've got shirts hung up.
[10:40.500 --> 10:44.840]  People are coming up and telling us how good of a job we do with the seeds and how good
[10:44.840 --> 10:47.000]  of a job we do with the podcast.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.720]  Somebody told me that they've been growing for several years, like maybe eight or 10
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.960]  years, I think they said, and then they discovered the podcast two years ago and they said that
[10:54.960 --> 10:56.800]  their crop has never been better.
[10:56.800 --> 10:59.000]  They're putting out a better product, better weights.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.760]  They're way more successful and they're having more fun and spending less time doing it.
[11:03.760 --> 11:10.080]  I told them, I said, honestly, bro, that statement means more to me than all of the sales I've
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.360]  made today because we sold some seeds.
[11:12.360 --> 11:13.360]  I'm not going to lie.
[11:13.360 --> 11:14.440]  We sold some seeds at that event.
[11:14.440 --> 11:15.760]  We did okay.
[11:15.760 --> 11:19.400]  I think that's what the compliments from the community, the people letting me know that
[11:19.400 --> 11:25.440]  this podcast is making your garden more fruitful, more successful, and also saving you time
[11:25.440 --> 11:28.460]  in there, but making it more enjoyable.
[11:28.460 --> 11:31.560]  Knowing that you're enjoying the garden and being successful because I sit here for a
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.320]  couple hours a day and put together a podcast that makes it all worth it.
[11:35.320 --> 11:37.480]  That fills me up inside.
[11:37.480 --> 11:39.680]  It's like recharge for my soul.
[11:39.680 --> 11:40.680]  It's like big plant nutrients.
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.520]  It's like a big HPS light for my soul.
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.080]  It just lights me up and grows me up.
[11:44.080 --> 11:45.680]  You guys, I do appreciate it.
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.080]  Thank you to everybody who gave me compliments on the podcast and then lots of compliments
[11:52.080 --> 11:53.080]  on the seeds.
[11:53.080 --> 11:56.440]  People like, bro, I've had better luck germinating your seeds than any other brand.
[11:56.440 --> 12:01.000]  I've had more vigorous plants, more potent plants, more heavy harvest than any other
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  brand.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  That stuff means a lot to me.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  Thank you guys.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.200]  Shout out to everybody who came up and gave me feedback.
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.040]  Then also some people were like, had a negative experience or you said something on the show
[12:10.040 --> 12:11.320]  I didn't like.
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.320]  Thank you.
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.640]  That stuff matters to me and I get to make corrections and adjustments because of that.
[12:15.640 --> 12:18.640]  Thank you for that criticism and feedback as well.
[12:18.640 --> 12:24.360]  Big thanks to everybody who came out to the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed event.
[12:24.360 --> 12:25.560]  That was a great time.
[12:25.560 --> 12:28.080]  I had a ton of fun.
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.320]  I want to give everybody that gave me a gift or a present, thank you.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.720]  You guys know who you are.
[12:33.720 --> 12:37.400]  I didn't bring them all to the table because I got a lot of great gifts.
[12:37.400 --> 12:38.400]  Thank you guys.
[12:38.400 --> 12:40.080]  Shout out to JJ for the pack of seeds he gave me.
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.320]  I'm looking at that at another table.
[12:41.320 --> 12:43.200]  I didn't bring that over here.
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.760]  I want to say a shout out to Wolfie.
[12:44.760 --> 12:47.200]  Wolf, bro, you threw up an amazing event.
[12:47.200 --> 12:49.320]  You looked stressed as shit when I got there.
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.520]  By the end of the event, you looked like a man who had accomplished something.
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.600]  I saw the look on your face of like, man, we did this and you did it, bro.
[12:55.600 --> 12:56.600]  It was successful.
[12:56.600 --> 13:01.680]  Shout out to Microbe Life Hydro for letting us have an event in their warehouse.
[13:01.680 --> 13:03.680]  That was super cool as well.
[13:03.680 --> 13:05.440]  Then big shout out to Mike.
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.440]  I was talking a moment ago how cool it was to be at my booth and just standing at the
[13:09.440 --> 13:12.360]  booth and people coming up.
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.480]  Being at the booth and standing there doing business and then looking over and my fucking
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.760]  best friend that's been hanging out and been my right-hand man for since fucking 2008,
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.480]  just looking over and seeing him nodding his head in success.
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.480]  He's like, we did it, buddy.
[13:25.480 --> 13:27.680]  I was like, we fucking did it, buddy.
[13:27.680 --> 13:30.400]  Just being there with my bro, that meant a lot to me.
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.240]  I don't know if he knows how much that meant to me.
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.740]  He was my first choice when I needed booth help.
[13:34.740 --> 13:35.740]  He nailed it.
[13:35.740 --> 13:36.740]  He was up early.
[13:36.740 --> 13:37.740]  He was on time.
[13:37.740 --> 13:39.280]  He pulled his weight and then some.
[13:39.280 --> 13:41.160]  He was fucking a good road dog too.
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.160]  It was a long drive home.
[13:42.160 --> 13:43.160]  You guys, that drive home was fucking exhausting.
[13:43.160 --> 13:47.800]  Might've been a little rainstorm on the way home, but Mike kept me awake.
[13:47.800 --> 13:48.800]  Mike kept me fucking talking.
[13:48.800 --> 13:49.800]  We had a good dinner.
[13:49.800 --> 13:50.800]  So shout out to my boy, Mike.
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.800]  Mike, come on the show, bro.
[13:51.800 --> 13:52.800]  I know you got the kiddos.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.800]  Things are chaotic in Mike's world.
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.600]  We're not going to talk too much about his private life, but he's doing some construction
[13:59.600 --> 14:01.560]  at home, some unexpected construction.
[14:01.560 --> 14:02.560]  So he's busy.
[14:02.560 --> 14:04.920]  His back is being put to the test, but Mike, I appreciate you, bro.
[14:04.920 --> 14:07.160]  Big shout out for all the help at the event.
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.160]  Bros for life, bro.
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.160]  Fist bump.
[14:09.160 --> 14:11.480]  And again, big shout out to my friend, Neil.
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.800]  My friend Neil gave me some lemon Jeffrey live rosin, and he also gave me some great
[14:16.800 --> 14:19.400]  compliments on the podcast.
[14:19.400 --> 14:21.960]  A lot of times I bash rosin.
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.280]  I'm really not a huge fan of most rosin and most of you guys are going to say, well, you're
[14:25.280 --> 14:27.640]  not smoking the right rosin or they're not doing it right.
[14:27.640 --> 14:28.640]  I know.
[14:28.640 --> 14:29.640]  I know.
[14:29.640 --> 14:30.960]  And most of you guys say that you give me rosin.
[14:30.960 --> 14:32.360]  It tastes like shit also.
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.340]  I think a lot of the times it tastes like a Popsicle stick or burnt popcorn.
[14:36.340 --> 14:38.500]  Let's recap and head back to my buddy, Neil.
[14:38.500 --> 14:41.060]  He gave me this lemon Jeffrey live rosin.
[14:41.060 --> 14:42.740]  Apparently I liked it because look at the jar.
[14:42.740 --> 14:43.980]  It is empty.
[14:43.980 --> 14:45.220]  It is zero.
[14:45.220 --> 14:49.020]  It is finito fin, the end, throw it away.
[14:49.020 --> 14:51.180]  I kept it because it still smells amazing.
[14:51.180 --> 14:53.880]  And this was my reminder to talk about it on the show.
[14:53.880 --> 14:56.740]  This lemon Jeffrey live rosin was tremendous.
[14:56.740 --> 15:01.300]  It didn't have the negative flavors, the negative things I usually experienced when I'm smoking
[15:01.300 --> 15:02.500]  rosin.
[15:02.500 --> 15:03.500]  This was delicious.
[15:03.500 --> 15:06.860]  I, uh, if I had paid money, I didn't, this was a gift.
[15:06.860 --> 15:10.180]  If I had paid money for this, I would go back and buy more.
[15:10.180 --> 15:11.180]  That's how much I enjoyed that.
[15:11.180 --> 15:14.980]  So Neil, if you're listening, bro, uh, had a great time talking to you.
[15:14.980 --> 15:16.320]  I feel like we made friends.
[15:16.320 --> 15:19.020]  You don't do social media, which blows my fucking mind.
[15:19.020 --> 15:22.560]  Um, send me a message, bro, because you're getting a big shout out on the show.
[15:22.560 --> 15:24.340]  Your concentrate was amazing.
[15:24.340 --> 15:27.460]  Lemon Jeffrey is quite possibly one of my top three favorite flavors.
[15:27.460 --> 15:28.700]  It's named after me.
[15:28.700 --> 15:30.860]  I am the Jeffrey in lemon Jeffrey.
[15:30.860 --> 15:33.160]  Uh, that's one of my favorites, bro.
[15:33.160 --> 15:34.180]  You did a really good job.
[15:34.180 --> 15:36.940]  I would, I'd probably, I'd buy that.
[15:36.940 --> 15:40.140]  I got lost and sidetracked on what I was saying, talking about how good that concentrate was,
[15:40.140 --> 15:41.300]  but I mean it, bro.
[15:41.300 --> 15:42.300]  Good shit.
[15:42.300 --> 15:43.300]  Good dude.
[15:43.300 --> 15:44.300]  Also hope we hang out.
[15:44.300 --> 15:45.300]  He doesn't have social media though, so that's weird.
[15:45.300 --> 15:50.420]  Then I was given another gift, um, by proxy, big shout out to my friend Jeremy, uh, for
[15:50.420 --> 15:56.020]  the, uh, delicious, uh, strawberry starburst number six and number five.
[15:56.020 --> 16:00.020]  And then also big shout out to Justin for being the facilitator of that product.
[16:00.020 --> 16:02.060]  Uh, Jeremy couldn't make it to the event.
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.940]  He was kind enough to send three jars of concentrate with our friend to make sure they
[16:05.940 --> 16:08.420]  made it to the booth.
[16:08.420 --> 16:10.420]  Um, same story here.
[16:10.420 --> 16:17.060]  I generally don't dab rosin, but this number six, the jar is empty, dude.
[16:17.060 --> 16:18.060]  It is empty.
[16:18.060 --> 16:22.220]  Oh, it smells, uh, it's got some tangy.
[16:22.220 --> 16:27.820]  It's got a little Clementine to it, but then it's got like a strawberry, like a fake strawberry
[16:27.820 --> 16:31.380]  candy, strawberry incense sort of thing going on to it.
[16:31.700 --> 16:32.980]  This one did not last long.
[16:32.980 --> 16:34.500]  You could tell that jar is empty.
[16:34.500 --> 16:35.660]  It's got scrape marks in it.
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.900]  I was trying to get the final dabs out of that one.
[16:38.900 --> 16:42.600]  There was number six, there was number five, and I think there was also number three.
[16:42.600 --> 16:44.300]  Number three is gone, non-existent.
[16:44.300 --> 16:49.160]  And then I think there might be just a little bit of the sap left in number five.
[16:49.160 --> 16:50.160]  So shout out to Jeremy.
[16:50.160 --> 16:51.580]  Dude, this stuff was delicious.
[16:51.580 --> 16:52.740]  Uh, good job.
[16:52.740 --> 16:55.540]  I would dab that all day long.
[16:55.540 --> 16:57.300]  Super turpy, super delicious.
[16:57.300 --> 16:58.980]  It didn't leave any weirdness on my nail.
[16:59.220 --> 17:01.740]  Uh, didn't make me cough, didn't make me choke.
[17:01.740 --> 17:05.340]  One thing I noticed about smoking rosin though, I smoke, uh, BHO.
[17:05.340 --> 17:08.260]  I smoke diamonds and sauce and primarily batters.
[17:08.260 --> 17:11.780]  Um, the rosins are heavy on my lungs.
[17:11.780 --> 17:12.980]  I don't need as big of a dab.
[17:12.980 --> 17:17.100]  I still take as big of a dab, but it feels like there's weight on my chest for a minute
[17:17.100 --> 17:18.100]  after I smoke it.
[17:18.100 --> 17:19.420]  I kind of enjoy it.
[17:19.420 --> 17:20.860]  Also it kind of fucking freaks me out.
[17:20.860 --> 17:23.240]  Getting older, I don't know if I like that weight on my chest feeling.
[17:23.240 --> 17:26.420]  I don't need a fucking heart attack or a stroke at this age.
[17:26.420 --> 17:30.540]  Anyway, uh, big thanks and big shout out to everybody for all the great gifts.
[17:30.540 --> 17:33.460]  Also, uh, big shout out to easy 057.
[17:33.460 --> 17:37.340]  I got to meet easy 057, take a picture, get a fist bump.
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.540]  I said, Hey bro, you've been a supporter for a long time.
[17:39.540 --> 17:40.820]  I want to give you some free seeds.
[17:40.820 --> 17:41.820]  What do you want?
[17:41.820 --> 17:43.020]  And he said, I've got everything.
[17:43.020 --> 17:45.340]  And I said, bro, you can't have everything on the list.
[17:45.340 --> 17:47.220]  And he's like, I got it all bro.
[17:47.220 --> 17:51.260]  So I was able to give my friend a shirt or a hoodie, uh, but he had all the seeds.
[17:51.260 --> 17:52.940]  So big shout out to easy 057.
[17:52.940 --> 17:54.180]  That was fucking cool.
[17:54.180 --> 17:55.900]  Also big shout out to my friend, Jake.
[17:55.900 --> 17:56.900]  Jake, you're a cool dude.
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.700]  He came to the booth several times.
[17:58.700 --> 18:02.380]  Uh, Jake would come and shop and then do a lap and then realize I've still got a few
[18:02.380 --> 18:03.380]  more bucks.
[18:03.380 --> 18:04.380]  I need to buy something else.
[18:04.380 --> 18:05.380]  Then he hit the ATM.
[18:05.380 --> 18:06.860]  He came back a few times.
[18:06.860 --> 18:09.220]  He left with bags and bags of iRi gear.
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.380]  We made sure to load him up.
[18:10.380 --> 18:11.380]  Jake's a cool fucking guy.
[18:11.380 --> 18:12.980]  iRi army, uh, through and through.
[18:12.980 --> 18:14.380]  I'm glad I met you, bro.
[18:14.380 --> 18:15.380]  Really cool guy.
[18:15.380 --> 18:16.380]  Look forward to chatting with you.
[18:16.380 --> 18:17.780]  I look forward to taking some dabs.
[18:17.780 --> 18:23.860]  Um, Wolf, Mike, Neil, Jeremy, Justin, easy Jake, uh, everybody else we met.
[18:23.860 --> 18:25.900]  I look forward to taking dabs with you in the future.
[18:25.900 --> 18:28.380]  Uh, also of course, JJ from top dog.
[18:28.380 --> 18:31.420]  It was great to finally shake your hand and tell you thanks for the inspiration.
[18:31.420 --> 18:32.420]  He gave me a pack of seeds.
[18:32.420 --> 18:36.500]  You guys, I'm not going to talk about that, but that may end up being a breeding project
[18:36.500 --> 18:37.500]  in the future.
[18:37.500 --> 18:42.060]  Also, I want to send a big shout out to DJ Nika T. I haven't seen Nika T in a long time.
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.860]  Uh, we used to be at all the same events.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.980]  When there were cannabis events, we would be there.
[18:45.980 --> 18:51.420]  Um, DJ Nika T is, uh, the, I think he's the owner and founder of essential extracts.
[18:51.420 --> 18:53.300]  At least he was at one point.
[18:53.300 --> 18:54.300]  That's how I knew him.
[18:54.300 --> 18:59.060]  He was DJ Nika T also that guy from essential extracts used to be the other guy with dreads.
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.100]  He's cut his dreads off now.
[19:00.100 --> 19:01.540]  I'm not following the trend.
[19:01.540 --> 19:02.540]  Don't do it.
[19:02.540 --> 19:08.540]  Uh, but DJ Nika T showed up and DJ Nika T set the vibe for the day.
[19:08.540 --> 19:09.540]  It was beautiful.
[19:09.540 --> 19:12.740]  Uh, Mike was like, I hope we don't have to listen to sublime all day.
[19:12.740 --> 19:13.740]  And I get it.
[19:13.740 --> 19:15.540]  Um, Mike's not really a reggae fan.
[19:15.540 --> 19:17.540]  Mike's not a sublime kind of fan.
[19:17.540 --> 19:20.500]  And when the DJ started playing reggae, Mike kind of looked at me like, Oh, it's going
[19:20.500 --> 19:21.540]  to be reggae all day.
[19:21.780 --> 19:25.300]  So he put a few songs in, he blended reggae with some other stuff with some good reggae
[19:25.300 --> 19:26.660]  with some other stuff.
[19:26.660 --> 19:29.620]  Mike's not a reggae fan and he actually enjoyed the musical vibes.
[19:29.620 --> 19:31.980]  It felt like they were playing a playlist for me.
[19:31.980 --> 19:36.020]  So big shout out to DJ Nika T, Kush and Coconut water.
[19:36.020 --> 19:38.340]  You guys, it was really exciting to be at events again.
[19:38.340 --> 19:42.340]  Um, I'm just rambling about an event because I wanted to recap it and talk about it because
[19:42.340 --> 19:46.740]  I haven't gone out and done something like that in such a long time that it was amazing.
[19:46.740 --> 19:50.340]  It also made me realize I need to update my booth.
[19:50.660 --> 19:53.060]  The booth looked good, but it could be better.
[19:53.060 --> 19:55.060]  Some of the guys have more professional booths.
[19:55.060 --> 19:59.060]  I saw a couple of things that inspired me, some ideas that I'm definitely going to, uh,
[19:59.060 --> 20:00.180]  I'm going to steal your ideas.
[20:00.180 --> 20:00.980]  That's how we do it, right?
[20:00.980 --> 20:04.580]  You see business that works and you copy things that work and you ditch ideas that don't work.
[20:05.300 --> 20:06.500]  That's what we're doing here.
[20:06.500 --> 20:11.620]  Uh, saw a great couple of ways just to improve the booth flow, improve, uh, the efficiency
[20:11.620 --> 20:13.780]  of the booth and lessen the environmental impact.
[20:13.780 --> 20:15.300]  I want to do less paper at the booth.
[20:15.300 --> 20:19.700]  I know that's some hippie shit, but there will be less paper, less takeaway stuff.
[20:19.700 --> 20:20.660]  It'll all be digital.
[20:21.220 --> 20:22.420]  The world's digital now.
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.380]  We don't need paper.
[20:23.380 --> 20:23.940]  All right.
[20:23.940 --> 20:27.220]  So thanks to everybody who came out to the event.
[20:27.220 --> 20:28.020]  I had a great time.
[20:28.020 --> 20:28.900]  Thanks for Wolf.
[20:28.900 --> 20:30.660]  Thanks to Wolf for throwing the event.
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.740]  Thanks to Microbe Life Hydro for hosting us.
[20:33.460 --> 20:37.300]  And then big thanks to everybody who was a partner in crime at the event.
[20:37.300 --> 20:40.180]  We had a great time and thanks to everybody who came up to the booth.
[20:40.180 --> 20:41.300]  I met a lot of people.
[20:41.300 --> 20:42.260]  It's good to see everybody.
[20:42.260 --> 20:45.940]  Big shout out to Katie Ann Peterson and your new, uh, and your partner in crime there.
[20:45.940 --> 20:46.740]  It's good to see you.
[20:46.740 --> 20:47.220]  All right.
[20:47.220 --> 20:48.660]  That's a lot of people to give shout outs.
[20:48.660 --> 20:51.140]  It felt like the BET awards or something here.
[20:51.140 --> 20:54.500]  Somebody did say that I do too many shout outs at the start of the show for Patreon.
[20:55.060 --> 21:01.460]  Um, those folks actually pay a Patreon tier where I promise to give them a shout out on the show.
[21:01.460 --> 21:03.860]  So if I didn't shout them out, I would be a dick.
[21:03.860 --> 21:05.460]  And I do it in the first minute of the show.
[21:05.460 --> 21:08.740]  If you don't want to hear the commercial and the shout outs, hit that skip button.
[21:08.740 --> 21:11.780]  When you don't hear music anymore, the shout outs are probably over.
[21:11.780 --> 21:12.820]  It's usually the way it works.
[21:12.820 --> 21:15.540]  The music and the shout outs last about the same time.
[21:15.540 --> 21:16.980]  And also the podcast is free.
[21:16.980 --> 21:18.020]  You're welcome.
[21:18.020 --> 21:20.100]  Um, where are we going to go from there?
[21:20.100 --> 21:23.860]  Um, once again, I wrote down, thanks for being patient while we fix and refix and
[21:23.860 --> 21:25.540]  refix all of the podcast servers.
[21:25.540 --> 21:27.300]  If you've missed episodes, I apologize.
[21:28.020 --> 21:30.740]  It's driving me crazy as well, but we're working on it.
[21:30.740 --> 21:31.700]  Shout out to my web guy.
[21:31.700 --> 21:33.220]  I think he listens to the show.
[21:33.220 --> 21:35.220]  If you hear this, bro, big thanks.
[21:35.220 --> 21:36.500]  Everybody appreciates you.
[21:37.060 --> 21:40.500]  Uh, not just me, the people listening, they all appreciate you.
[21:40.500 --> 21:44.180]  Now I do want to move on to the main topic of this podcast.
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.220]  I've been talking for quite a while.
[21:45.220 --> 21:46.340]  This is going to be a long show.
[21:46.900 --> 21:49.940]  Um, this portion of the show is brought to you by my friend, Kes Burton.
[21:49.940 --> 21:51.300]  Shout out to my buddy, Kes Burton.
[21:51.300 --> 21:54.660]  This topic is going to be seed storage.
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.980]  Uh, we sold a bunch of seeds at the seed event.
[21:56.980 --> 21:59.220]  I get a lot of messages about how to store seeds.
[21:59.220 --> 22:04.420]  I felt like this would be a great appropriate episode to segue the seed event into seed
[22:04.420 --> 22:04.980]  storage.
[22:04.980 --> 22:06.660]  Perhaps you went to an event this weekend.
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.260]  Perhaps you've been shopping online.
[22:08.260 --> 22:11.700]  Perhaps you're headed to the events that are coming up and you've got a bunch of seeds.
[22:11.700 --> 22:15.140]  What do I do with my seeds as a seed breeder, as a seed seller?
[22:15.140 --> 22:19.380]  My number one recommendation for what you do with your seeds is to guess what?
[22:19.380 --> 22:20.100]  Grow them.
[22:20.100 --> 22:22.500]  I didn't make seeds for you to put them in a fucking vault.
[22:22.500 --> 22:24.820]  I don't want those seeds in a fucking desk drawer.
[22:24.820 --> 22:26.820]  I don't want those seeds in your safe.
[22:26.820 --> 22:31.540]  I would prefer not to see them in your fucking junk drawer or your underwear drawer or wherever
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.140]  you keep them in your fridge.
[22:33.140 --> 22:35.060]  I want you to put them in the dirt.
[22:35.060 --> 22:39.940]  Um, depending on your location and your legalities, iRegenetics is not responsible for a violation
[22:39.940 --> 22:44.580]  of, uh, growing laws or rules or regulations, but if you're in a safe legal place, I really
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.980]  want you to get them wet and put them in the fucking dirt.
[22:46.980 --> 22:48.260]  I don't want you to store them.
[22:48.260 --> 22:52.820]  However, I do appreciate, love and respect and admire that people are buying my seed
[22:52.820 --> 22:55.140]  packages and keeping them like baseball cards.
[22:55.140 --> 22:56.740]  Uh, they treat them like a Pokemon card.
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.020]  I got to get them all.
[22:58.020 --> 23:00.420]  And as a seller of seeds that I have no complaints.
[23:00.420 --> 23:02.980]  If you're going to put those in a drawer, I guess I'm going to be excited about that.
[23:02.980 --> 23:07.620]  But let's talk about a way to safely and effectively long-term store.
[23:07.620 --> 23:09.540]  These seeds, seeds are not cheap.
[23:09.540 --> 23:11.220]  Uh, seeds do not last forever.
[23:11.220 --> 23:14.420]  I like to pride myself in being one of the more affordable seed breeders.
[23:14.420 --> 23:17.140]  Also, I saw some prices this weekend.
[23:17.140 --> 23:19.940]  I've seen some prices online and you guys are welcome.
[23:19.940 --> 23:21.700]  I'm, I'm staying very affordable.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.140]  I don't need to take all of your money.
[23:23.140 --> 23:24.500]  I just need to get paid for my work.
[23:24.500 --> 23:26.180]  I don't need, you know, we're not trying to get rich.
[23:26.180 --> 23:28.900]  We're just trying to live over here, make sure everybody's fed.
[23:28.900 --> 23:30.980]  Uh, maybe some, some sneakers will be all right.
[23:30.980 --> 23:34.340]  Anyway, I'm rambling, but, uh, you've got expensive seeds.
[23:34.340 --> 23:35.220]  You want to keep them alive.
[23:35.220 --> 23:35.940]  You want to keep them safe.
[23:35.940 --> 23:36.980]  You want to keep them stored.
[23:36.980 --> 23:40.260]  What is the best way to store these seeds for long-term?
[23:40.740 --> 23:43.940]  Uh, most of the seeds that you buy are going to be in a package.
[23:43.940 --> 23:46.580]  They should be in some sort of a sealed package already.
[23:46.580 --> 23:48.020]  I'm looking across the table.
[23:48.020 --> 23:50.980]  Uh, JJ sells his seeds in that like Mylar package.
[23:50.980 --> 23:53.780]  It seems to be vacuum sealed or at least heat sealed.
[23:53.780 --> 23:58.500]  I'm looking at, uh, Loving in her eyes has quite an extravagant package, but on the inside,
[23:58.500 --> 24:01.060]  those are sealed inside of a little vial.
[24:01.060 --> 24:05.940]  My seeds come in a disc with the foam padding on the inside, the disc to keep the seeds
[24:05.940 --> 24:07.220]  from rattling around.
[24:07.220 --> 24:09.380]  Those are inside of a baggie with the folded card.
[24:09.380 --> 24:11.380]  Insert that baggie is heat sealed.
[24:11.380 --> 24:14.980]  So most of the seeds are going to be sealed in a good package already.
[24:14.980 --> 24:17.860]  The first thing I would suggest is maybe putting your seeds.
[24:17.860 --> 24:21.220]  If you've got a lot of packs, you're trying to seal, get one box and put them all in one
[24:21.220 --> 24:22.660]  box that does seal.
[24:23.220 --> 24:28.180]  Um, I've got for my small personal stash that I know I'm going to, I think I'm going to
[24:28.180 --> 24:28.660]  run.
[24:28.660 --> 24:31.380]  I've got a, it's a grateful dead lunchbox.
[24:31.380 --> 24:32.820]  It's one of those metal lunchboxes.
[24:32.820 --> 24:35.620]  It doesn't seal super tight, but it seals enough for me.
[24:35.620 --> 24:37.220]  And all those seeds are already sealed.
[24:37.220 --> 24:40.580]  So I'm comfortable with that for my personal little storage stash.
[24:40.580 --> 24:46.340]  My, uh, my nostalgic seed vault, if you will, I would recommend something that is airtight.
[24:46.340 --> 24:50.420]  They make those little, uh, all the head shops used to have them in the late nineties, early
[24:50.420 --> 24:50.980]  two thousands.
[24:50.980 --> 24:51.780]  We were in high school.
[24:51.780 --> 24:54.900]  It's what we kept all our shit in just a little airtight stash box.
[24:54.900 --> 24:56.420]  It's just got a rubber grommet around it.
[24:56.420 --> 24:57.700]  It's a metal box.
[24:57.700 --> 25:01.860]  Uh, it's probably got lead Zeppelin or insane clown posse or something fucking printed on
[25:01.860 --> 25:01.940]  it.
[25:01.940 --> 25:03.220]  Maybe you got Tupac on yours.
[25:03.220 --> 25:04.100]  I don't know.
[25:04.100 --> 25:08.180]  Uh, but, uh, what we need to do is make an IRI genetics seed stash box.
[25:08.180 --> 25:08.740]  Just like that.
[25:08.740 --> 25:12.420]  If you know how to do that, if you were the person that does that, please contact me.
[25:12.420 --> 25:15.860]  Uh, we will hook you the fuck up because everybody out there is going to want to buy an IRI
[25:15.860 --> 25:17.380]  genetics seed stash box.
[25:17.380 --> 25:18.260]  Let's get back on track.
[25:18.260 --> 25:22.020]  We need a stash box, something that could be airtight, not super airtight.
[25:22.020 --> 25:22.580]  Isn't critical.
[25:22.580 --> 25:23.380]  I like the airtight.
[25:23.380 --> 25:26.020]  So we're going to put the seeds in the airtight boxes.
[25:26.020 --> 25:26.980]  The first step.
[25:26.980 --> 25:28.580]  Then where do we put that?
[25:28.580 --> 25:31.860]  I see a lot of people putting their seeds in the refrigerator.
[25:31.860 --> 25:35.380]  Let me talk a little bit about that because I'm going to say, put your seeds in a cool,
[25:35.380 --> 25:36.340]  dry, dark place.
[25:36.340 --> 25:38.980]  And people are going to say, that's the refrigerator or the crisper drawer.
[25:39.540 --> 25:40.260]  That is cool.
[25:41.060 --> 25:42.500]  Also, I don't like the freezer.
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.660]  That's going to fall into this category.
[25:44.660 --> 25:49.940]  Think about if you put, uh, anything in the crisper drawer, anything in the fridge, it
[25:49.940 --> 25:50.980]  makes condensation.
[25:50.980 --> 25:52.020]  It gets cold in there, right?
[25:52.020 --> 25:53.860]  It creates moisture inside that package.
[25:54.420 --> 25:56.100]  Then you take that out.
[25:56.100 --> 25:58.020]  Now that moisture has to go somewhere.
[25:58.020 --> 26:00.740]  That condensation is inside of that package.
[26:00.740 --> 26:05.220]  You've got moisture moving around inside of your package, possibly inside of your seed
[26:05.220 --> 26:05.700]  package.
[26:05.700 --> 26:08.340]  What germinates your seeds is moisture.
[26:08.340 --> 26:12.500]  So you can create a condensation issue by putting your seeds in the fridge and taking
[26:12.500 --> 26:15.780]  them out or putting them in the freezer and taking them out too frequently.
[26:16.420 --> 26:21.780]  If you do choose to store your seeds in the refrigerator or in the freezer, put them in
[26:21.780 --> 26:24.500]  there and leave them there for a while.
[26:24.500 --> 26:28.260]  If you're the kind of person that likes to pull out your seeds and marvel at your collection
[26:28.260 --> 26:32.260]  or show off your seeds to your friends, I don't recommend putting them in that deep
[26:32.260 --> 26:32.900]  of a cold.
[26:33.700 --> 26:38.820]  In that case, I recommend just a cool, dry, dark environment.
[26:39.460 --> 26:41.860]  Perhaps you live in Colorado and you've got a basement.
[26:41.860 --> 26:46.740]  Maybe you've got a back dark corner of that basement where you can put a safe, put those
[26:46.740 --> 26:48.340]  seeds in that safe.
[26:48.340 --> 26:51.540]  That will stay cool in the basement in Colorado.
[26:51.540 --> 26:54.100]  It stays about 75 degrees ish.
[26:54.100 --> 26:55.780]  It may get a little bit colder in the winter.
[26:55.780 --> 26:57.700]  It may get a little bit hotter in the summer.
[26:57.700 --> 27:01.620]  But if you got the normal house environment happening, it's going to stay about 75 down
[27:01.620 --> 27:04.900]  there in the basement because you got the heater upstairs running the house to keep
[27:04.900 --> 27:06.980]  it warm or you got the cooler keeping it cool.
[27:06.980 --> 27:08.580]  It's going to kind of adjust the downstairs.
[27:08.580 --> 27:10.100]  The house stays insulated.
[27:10.100 --> 27:11.300]  Pretty good temperature down there.
[27:11.300 --> 27:12.580]  Find that back secure corner.
[27:12.580 --> 27:13.940]  Nobody knows how to find.
[27:13.940 --> 27:15.540]  Put your safe with your seeds back there.
[27:15.540 --> 27:16.500]  That's nice and secure.
[27:16.500 --> 27:19.380]  Cool, dry, dark, safe environment.
[27:19.380 --> 27:22.660]  Also a safe environment, something that nobody could get to because you don't want people
[27:22.660 --> 27:24.580]  stealing your expensive freaking seeds.
[27:25.060 --> 27:31.060]  Heat, in my opinion, is one of the best ways to destroy and degrade the lifespan of a seed.
[27:31.060 --> 27:32.180]  So keep those seeds cool.
[27:32.180 --> 27:34.180]  The cooler, the better to a point.
[27:34.180 --> 27:36.900]  You don't want to get them so cold that they rupture and explode.
[27:36.900 --> 27:38.340]  That's another thing to talk about.
[27:38.900 --> 27:40.500]  Super dry seeds.
[27:40.500 --> 27:44.020]  I try to dry my seeds really, really dry before I send them to anybody.
[27:44.020 --> 27:49.940]  Something we did discover is that if you don't dry the seeds enough, I was having an issue
[27:49.940 --> 27:52.900]  that seeds going to one direction, I was getting complaints on it.
[27:52.980 --> 27:56.020]  Seeds I sent to another direction I didn't get any complaints about.
[27:56.020 --> 27:59.380]  And I was like, how come everybody on the East Coast is having germination issues with
[27:59.380 --> 28:00.660]  this new batch of seeds?
[28:00.660 --> 28:02.660]  Everybody on the West Coast, their seeds are just fine.
[28:02.660 --> 28:03.300]  I thought about it.
[28:03.300 --> 28:04.500]  It's the middle of winter.
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.260]  The seeds going that way are fucking freezing.
[28:06.260 --> 28:07.940]  The seeds going that way are just fine.
[28:08.580 --> 28:10.580]  Then I thought there's freezing and erupting.
[28:10.580 --> 28:12.740]  They're probably erupting in cargo.
[28:12.740 --> 28:13.860]  They're probably on a plane.
[28:13.860 --> 28:17.380]  They're getting too cold and they're bursting in the plane in the cargo.
[28:18.180 --> 28:20.980]  So I've started drying the seeds a little bit more.
[28:21.060 --> 28:23.140]  Just put them with, what is it called?
[28:23.140 --> 28:24.180]  It's not a Boveda.
[28:24.180 --> 28:27.380]  It's a silicate pack that just sucks up all the moisture.
[28:27.380 --> 28:29.780]  I've got the number written down at the point I want to get it below.
[28:29.780 --> 28:32.580]  Once I'm below that point, I know they won't rupture in the mail.
[28:32.580 --> 28:33.940]  I know they won't rupture in cargo.
[28:33.940 --> 28:35.620]  They won't rupture if they get too cold.
[28:35.620 --> 28:36.980]  Makes the seeds a little bit safer.
[28:36.980 --> 28:40.500]  This is how much thought we were putting into keeping the seeds safe and fresh to get them
[28:40.500 --> 28:42.100]  to the grower.
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.020]  We want you to have success.
[28:44.020 --> 28:46.580]  If you don't have success with my seeds, you can email me.
[28:46.580 --> 28:50.900]  And over time, eventually you will get a replacement pack if you've got a replacement pack.
[28:50.900 --> 28:53.460]  You've got a good reason if you didn't fuck them up being completely stupid.
[28:54.020 --> 28:58.020]  I'd rather have good customer service and eat a pack than you hate me and spread fucking
[28:58.020 --> 29:00.180]  shit on the internet about me because I do care about you.
[29:00.180 --> 29:02.340]  So dry seeds is the main idea.
[29:02.340 --> 29:03.620]  Keep them nice and dry.
[29:03.620 --> 29:05.460]  So I'm going to cool, dry, dark place.
[29:05.460 --> 29:06.660]  Don't freeze them.
[29:06.660 --> 29:07.780]  Heat will ruin them.
[29:07.780 --> 29:09.300]  I don't prefer them in the freezer.
[29:09.300 --> 29:11.460]  Extremes of either way, I don't think are good.
[29:11.460 --> 29:13.780]  If you got to go extreme one way, cold is the best.
[29:13.780 --> 29:15.780]  If you think about it, they probably fell out of the plant.
[29:15.780 --> 29:16.500]  They landed.
[29:16.500 --> 29:17.620]  They stayed in the snow.
[29:17.620 --> 29:18.420]  The snow melted.
[29:18.420 --> 29:19.700]  It became water.
[29:19.700 --> 29:20.980]  That water germinated the seed.
[29:20.980 --> 29:21.460]  It grew up.
[29:21.460 --> 29:23.460]  So I think the cold is preservation.
[29:23.460 --> 29:25.220]  That's not as bad as heat.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.460]  All right.
[29:25.460 --> 29:29.220]  So to recap, I really recommend a cool, dry, dark place.
[29:29.220 --> 29:32.820]  If you insist on putting them in the refrigerator, I do recommend you put them in that crisper
[29:32.820 --> 29:33.140]  drawer.
[29:33.140 --> 29:34.100]  Try to keep them dry.
[29:34.660 --> 29:37.220]  Put them in an airtight container if you're going to put them in there.
[29:38.340 --> 29:42.180]  Once again, I don't recommend the freezer if you're going to take them out and put them
[29:42.180 --> 29:42.740]  back.
[29:42.740 --> 29:46.660]  If you're the kind of person that wants to show them off, just a cool, dry, dark place
[29:47.300 --> 29:50.500]  like a corner in the basement, a shelf in the basement, something like that, something
[29:50.500 --> 29:51.380]  no one's going to get to.
[29:52.340 --> 29:54.420]  None of your pets are going to find them and eat them.
[29:54.420 --> 29:58.180]  Something else I want to talk about is when you're restoring these seeds, make sure that
[29:58.180 --> 29:59.700]  they are labeled.
[29:59.700 --> 30:00.660]  They have a name on them.
[30:00.660 --> 30:02.660]  Are they in the original breeder packaging?
[30:02.660 --> 30:04.260]  Did you write the name on a baggie?
[30:04.260 --> 30:06.980]  And every time you touch it, you're rubbing that name off with your thumb.
[30:06.980 --> 30:09.780]  And in a few years, you won't even know what those seeds are.
[30:09.780 --> 30:12.900]  Think about how well labeled and sealed those seeds are.
[30:12.900 --> 30:15.460]  Also write down the date of when you put those in there.
[30:15.460 --> 30:17.940]  So you know how long you've had those seeds around.
[30:17.940 --> 30:20.660]  Then also, are they regular or feminized seeds?
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.660]  I would write that down on the packaging as well.
[30:22.660 --> 30:26.260]  I try to include as many details as I can in a package of seeds.
[30:26.260 --> 30:27.940]  I like to be a little bit excessive.
[30:27.940 --> 30:31.220]  I claim to be sort of a cannabis historian or something like that.
[30:31.220 --> 30:32.740]  I'm documenting cannabis.
[30:32.740 --> 30:34.180]  I talk a lot about cannabis.
[30:34.180 --> 30:35.860]  I argue a lot about cannabis.
[30:35.860 --> 30:36.740]  I want to be correct.
[30:36.740 --> 30:38.580]  So I try to make a lot of details.
[30:39.220 --> 30:44.180]  In the future, this cannabis stuff is going to be talked about, the revolution of cannabis,
[30:44.820 --> 30:46.740]  how cannabis became legal in some areas.
[30:46.740 --> 30:49.380]  And we had medical cannabis and the growing and the breeding.
[30:49.380 --> 30:51.060]  And all this culture will be talked about.
[30:51.060 --> 30:51.540]  This will be...
[30:52.580 --> 30:53.300]  We're pioneers.
[30:53.300 --> 30:55.780]  If you're in this right now, you are a pioneer.
[30:55.780 --> 30:58.820]  And I was here from a lot of the beginning of this stuff.
[30:58.820 --> 31:02.100]  And so it's kind of my responsibility with the way my brain works,
[31:02.100 --> 31:04.180]  the way I talk to people with this show platform.
[31:04.180 --> 31:08.740]  It's kind of my responsibility to make sure that history and cannabis lore
[31:08.740 --> 31:10.260]  and all of that stuff stays accurate.
[31:10.260 --> 31:14.100]  I just had a baby lacewing crawl on my arm.
[31:14.100 --> 31:17.540]  So my IPM is working because it jumped from this plant onto my arm.
[31:17.540 --> 31:19.300]  A little baby lacewing freaked me out.
[31:19.300 --> 31:19.860]  I felt it.
[31:21.140 --> 31:22.820]  Yeah, beneficial insects are the way to go.
[31:23.620 --> 31:26.340]  Yeah, if you've ever seen a little baby lacewing, it looks like a little crocodile.
[31:26.340 --> 31:28.740]  It's like a little tiny dinosaur, one of the ugliest little bugs ever.
[31:28.740 --> 31:30.420]  And then it turns into a lacewing.
[31:30.420 --> 31:33.540]  I got totally distracted by feeling that bug climb up my arm.
[31:33.540 --> 31:37.220]  But I think I have made my point for most of this episode
[31:37.220 --> 31:39.460]  because I really do not remember where I was.
[31:39.460 --> 31:42.420]  So I think that is a good point just to start wrapping up the podcast.
[31:42.420 --> 31:44.340]  You guys, I want to thank everybody for listening.
