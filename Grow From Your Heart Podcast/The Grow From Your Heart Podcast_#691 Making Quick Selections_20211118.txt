[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.660]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 691 of the Grow From Your
[00:26.660 --> 00:28.380]  Heart Podcast.
[00:28.380 --> 00:31.540]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of Patreon questions.
[00:31.540 --> 00:35.040]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:35.040 --> 00:39.160]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.260]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:43.260 --> 00:44.600]  The Painted Lady.
[00:44.600 --> 00:49.120]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Grant M and 716 Vibes.
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.000]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Prospect and Steve F. Let's send a
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  big thank you shout out to Terp Goonie Farms.

[01:36.000 --> 01:40.160]  This is the part of the podcast where I do want to say that I did receive the message.
[01:40.160 --> 01:41.640]  I've been doing shorter episodes.
[01:41.640 --> 01:43.680]  I asked for feedback on that.
[01:43.680 --> 01:46.920]  Most of the people listening have said they want longer episodes.
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.200]  I will do my best to answer that request, fulfill that demand.
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.100]  Longer episodes are coming your way.
[01:53.100 --> 01:56.080]  This episode should be long, should be a good show.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.080]  Thank you for the feedback.
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.760]  I do appreciate the feedback, the comments, the questions, corrections, comments, concerns,
[02:01.760 --> 02:03.000]  emails, all of that stuff.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  It does mean a lot to me.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  So thank you.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.680]  The message has been received.
[02:06.680 --> 02:08.080]  I will do longer episodes.
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.360]  We'll start by doing that in this episode.
[02:10.360 --> 02:13.260]  Also let me remind you about the Black Friday sale coming up.
[02:13.260 --> 02:18.300]  If you are looking for iRee t-shirts, trays, grinders, stickers, maybe something like that
[02:18.300 --> 02:22.820]  for a gift, the Black Friday sale will begin on November 25th and that does go through
[02:22.820 --> 02:23.820]  the 30th.
[02:23.820 --> 02:26.540]  Hit the website, iReeGenetics.com.
[02:26.540 --> 02:28.700]  There is an iRee merch tab on there.
[02:28.700 --> 02:32.740]  That tab will take you directly to the store when you get there.

[02:39.740 --> 02:41.100]  And thank you for all of the support.
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.100]  All right.
[02:42.100 --> 02:43.100]  Don't miss that Black Friday sale.
[02:43.940 --> 02:47.620]  Also, seedsherenow.com will get a restock very soon.
[02:47.620 --> 02:48.620]  That's what I've been hearing.
[02:48.620 --> 02:49.620]  All right.
[02:49.620 --> 02:50.740]  We covered all the chatter at the start of the show.
[02:50.740 --> 02:53.420]  Some people say that I talk too long at the start of the show.
[02:53.420 --> 02:54.700]  We've got some business to cover.
[02:54.700 --> 02:57.420]  We do have sponsors and things like that that do help us out.
[02:57.420 --> 02:59.740]  I got to give shout outs to my friends from Patreon.
[02:59.740 --> 03:03.500]  So thank you for being patient getting through the first 30 seconds of the show here.
[03:03.500 --> 03:05.620]  Let's jump into some of the main topics.
[03:05.620 --> 03:08.580]  I do have a couple of great emails here in front of me.
[03:08.580 --> 03:09.580]  Big shout out.
[03:09.580 --> 03:11.900]  Big thanks to all the people that message me on Patreon.
[03:11.900 --> 03:13.660]  Thank you for the love.
[03:13.660 --> 03:18.860]  This one comes from my friend Mark and it says, I've got a question for you.
[03:18.860 --> 03:24.100]  After revegging a flowering clone and transplanting soon thereafter, what week of the vegetation
[03:24.100 --> 03:25.920]  phase are we now in?
[03:25.920 --> 03:27.740]  That's a really good question.
[03:27.740 --> 03:28.740]  Let's think about that.
[03:28.740 --> 03:30.660]  You've got a plant that went into flower.
[03:30.660 --> 03:31.660]  Then you revegged it.
[03:31.660 --> 03:33.020]  It is now revegging.
[03:33.020 --> 03:35.180]  You could cut a clone from that revegging plant.
[03:35.180 --> 03:36.180]  You've got that clone going.
[03:36.180 --> 03:37.940]  It is now a fresh plant.
[03:37.940 --> 03:42.220]  The real question that you are asking is what week of the vegetation phase are we now
[03:42.220 --> 03:43.220]  in?
[03:43.220 --> 03:49.980]  Honestly, technically, I don't really count veg weeks that critically.
[03:49.980 --> 03:54.280]  You can decide when you took it out of the cloner and put it into a container.
[03:54.280 --> 03:56.820]  You can say that that is officially day one of veg.
[03:56.820 --> 04:04.340]  If you need a real solid day of marking day one of veg, it doesn't really matter.
[04:04.340 --> 04:06.620]  The time for veg is kind of arbitrary.
[04:06.620 --> 04:07.620]  Why are you counting?
[04:08.300 --> 04:09.300]  If it's big enough, put it into flower.
[04:09.300 --> 04:10.300]  It's great to have a schedule.
[04:10.300 --> 04:12.380]  It's great to have a timeline.
[04:12.380 --> 04:16.400]  The reason we keep a good track of what day it is in flower is because we want to know
[04:16.400 --> 04:19.020]  how many days we typically flower this plant.
[04:19.020 --> 04:21.660]  Then we will cut it down on that schedule.
[04:21.660 --> 04:25.420]  For veg, it's not hypercritical to know what day, what week we are in.
[04:25.420 --> 04:29.540]  If you really need a day, like I said, you're going to cut the clone.
[04:29.540 --> 04:31.020]  You're going to have a revegging plant.
[04:31.020 --> 04:33.700]  Then you're going to cut a good shoot off of that revegging plant.
[04:33.700 --> 04:35.180]  That'll go into a clone dome.
[04:35.180 --> 04:40.300]  I think when it comes out of the clone dome into that cup or that first pot, that is what
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.500]  I would call small veg.
[04:42.500 --> 04:43.940]  That is the beginning of that plant.
[04:43.940 --> 04:46.660]  That is now the start of what I would say is veg.
[04:46.660 --> 04:50.920]  Then when it goes into a bigger pot, that obviously would be what I ... Maybe not obviously.
[04:50.920 --> 04:54.140]  That is what I would obviously to myself call large veg.
[04:54.140 --> 04:56.620]  I do a small veg and a large veg.
[04:56.620 --> 04:59.180]  Then they go into flower from there.
[04:59.180 --> 05:04.020]  Like I said before, it's not hypercritical to really have a week, a timeline like that
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.020]  of veg.
[05:05.020 --> 05:08.300]  I would know that when it gets this big, I should flower it.
[05:08.300 --> 05:12.980]  That's kind of more what I would pay attention to, that day of when to start the vegetation
[05:12.980 --> 05:13.980]  phase.
[05:13.980 --> 05:16.380]  If you really need that, you can invent a day that suits your needs.
[05:16.380 --> 05:22.020]  I would go from when it goes into the first initial cup or pot, when it hits soil, I guess,
[05:22.020 --> 05:26.940]  or cocoa or hydro, however you're doing it, when it goes into your main system.
[05:26.940 --> 05:32.300]  There's really no hard and fast rule on that because you can just veg as long as you want.
[05:32.300 --> 05:36.020]  Like I said a moment ago, I'm repeating myself at this time, but the reason we keep good
[05:36.020 --> 05:39.900]  notes in flower of what day and what week we are in is because we know that at the end
[05:39.900 --> 05:43.360]  of week nine or at the end of week 10, we can harvest these plants.
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.360]  That's a little more critical.
[05:44.360 --> 05:46.020]  I do appreciate the enthusiasm.
[05:46.020 --> 05:47.020]  That's a really good question.
[05:47.020 --> 05:49.980]  I also appreciate the continued Patreon support.
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.140]  I really do thank you for that.
[05:52.140 --> 05:53.260]  Big shout out to my buddy, Mark.
[05:53.260 --> 05:54.660]  You know who you are.
[05:54.660 --> 05:55.660]  Thank you, bro.
[05:55.660 --> 05:56.660]  I appreciate you.
[05:56.660 --> 05:59.660]  Look forward to hearing from you in the future because we do correspond a lot.
[05:59.660 --> 06:04.460]  I'm glad the I read genetics, Rasta Jeff and grow from your heart podcast coffee mugs
[06:04.460 --> 06:05.900]  landed safely.
[06:05.900 --> 06:06.900]  Big up my friend.
[06:06.900 --> 06:10.780]  All right, we are going to keep moving because I feel like I've got a good flow.
[06:10.780 --> 06:12.540]  I am nicely stoned.
[06:12.540 --> 06:13.700]  We got a good flow going.
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.300]  No need to slow down.
[06:15.300 --> 06:16.300]  Let's keep going.
[06:16.300 --> 06:18.020]  This one came from our friend B Bala.
[06:18.020 --> 06:19.020]  Shout out to B Bala.
[06:19.020 --> 06:21.800]  I also been corresponding with B Bala quite frequently.
[06:21.800 --> 06:25.300]  It's been fun interacting with the community more now that the outdoor grow is settled
[06:25.300 --> 06:27.140]  and some things have caught up.
[06:27.140 --> 06:30.060]  Things do get a little bit slower around here during the winter time, so I will be
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.060]  online more.
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.140]  You'll be getting more correspondence and interaction.
[06:33.140 --> 06:34.140]  I look forward to it.
[06:34.140 --> 06:35.300]  Here goes the rambling shit.
[06:35.300 --> 06:36.300]  Let's get me focused.
[06:36.300 --> 06:38.500]  It says, hey, bro.
[06:38.500 --> 06:43.100]  So I have purchased a bunch of your regular seeds, almost everything that is available
[06:43.100 --> 06:44.300]  in Canada.
[06:44.300 --> 06:46.540]  Big thanks for that and much appreciated.
[06:46.540 --> 06:49.580]  A lot of people have been asking if they can get I recedes in Canada.
[06:49.580 --> 06:50.580]  That is very easy.
[06:50.580 --> 06:51.580]  Visit the website.
[06:51.580 --> 06:56.420]  If you click on the seed vendor tab, there is a Canadian flag that Canadian flag.
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.860]  That's the magic ticket right there.
[06:57.860 --> 06:59.900]  Click on that one that will get you a Canadian vendor.
[06:59.900 --> 07:05.180]  Shout out to my buddy, the dude that is the dude's world that will get you going in Canada.
[07:05.180 --> 07:06.460]  Big up to my Canadian friends.
[07:06.460 --> 07:10.900]  It also goes on to say, I know you were saying something about running them in small pots
[07:10.900 --> 07:13.100]  and flipping them quickly to find a keeper.
[07:13.100 --> 07:17.860]  I was just wondering if you could talk a little more into detail about that, because that
[07:17.860 --> 07:22.060]  is something I would like to do with all of the regular seeds I just got.
[07:22.060 --> 07:23.060]  Thanks for everything, bro.
[07:23.060 --> 07:25.620]  I learned so much every time.
[07:25.620 --> 07:26.620]  Thank you, bro.
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.620]  Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[07:27.620 --> 07:29.180]  You've been throwing down pretty good on Patreon.
[07:29.180 --> 07:30.580]  You've been buying a lot of beans.
[07:30.580 --> 07:34.260]  I think I actually sent you a hoodie or something, because I remember seeing your name.
[07:34.260 --> 07:36.260]  Big thank you for all that support.
[07:36.260 --> 07:38.260]  Let's talk about that.
[07:38.260 --> 07:42.820]  When I am running a new crop, let's just say ... Recently, you guys know, maybe you don't
[07:42.820 --> 07:43.820]  know.
[07:43.820 --> 07:44.820]  We'll talk about it.
[07:44.820 --> 07:48.020]  If you've been following along with the show, you know that I just did an outdoor breeding
[07:48.020 --> 07:49.020]  run.
[07:49.020 --> 07:50.720]  We made some seeds in a greenhouse.
[07:50.720 --> 07:53.900]  Some of the seeds I made in that breeding run have never been made before, so I need
[07:53.900 --> 07:54.900]  to test them.
[07:54.900 --> 07:57.140]  I need to see what I've produced.
[07:57.140 --> 08:01.100]  It's unlikely that I've produced a bunch of garbage, but it is very possible.
[08:01.100 --> 08:02.660]  I may have made mutants.
[08:02.660 --> 08:04.420]  I may have made intersex plants.
[08:04.420 --> 08:05.780]  I may have made a bunch of hemp.
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.540]  I may have made a bunch of trash.
[08:07.540 --> 08:10.940]  I may have made things that don't fit the program for what I'm looking for, but may
[08:10.940 --> 08:12.260]  be good for somebody else.
[08:12.260 --> 08:16.100]  But still, I need to find out what I've made is the bottom line here.
[08:16.100 --> 08:20.180]  The quickest and most efficient way to do that would be to grow a bunch of small plants.
[08:20.180 --> 08:25.100]  Why do I want to run these plants in three gallon pots and put nine of them under a thousand
[08:25.100 --> 08:28.580]  watt light and waste a bunch of space and waste a bunch of time vegging them when I
[08:28.580 --> 08:30.380]  can put them into very small pots?
[08:30.380 --> 08:31.460]  I keep saying beer cups.
[08:31.460 --> 08:37.260]  I buy a bag of 50 Solo cups from the local store down the street, and I've got 50 pots
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.260]  to put plants in.
[08:38.260 --> 08:41.220]  It takes me a minute to stab holes in them with some scissors because I do need some
[08:41.220 --> 08:44.660]  drainage, but I can get a bunch of pots for a very affordable price.
[08:44.660 --> 08:47.100]  50 beer cups is very affordable.
[08:47.100 --> 08:50.620]  Again, when you're done, if the plant isn't any good, you can just toss that whole thing.
[08:50.620 --> 08:51.940]  You don't feel like you're wasting a pot.
[08:51.940 --> 08:53.180]  It doesn't feel like a lot of waste.
[08:53.180 --> 08:54.500]  It could just come and go.
[08:54.500 --> 08:55.780]  Or you can do small pots.
[08:55.780 --> 08:58.460]  But I don't really need to grow large plants to see what I've got.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.580]  So I'll get these plants going.
[08:59.580 --> 09:00.660]  I'll put a seed.
[09:00.660 --> 09:01.660]  I'll germinate a seed.
[09:01.660 --> 09:05.980]  I'll put that seed into the beer cup or into maybe a one gallon pot at the biggest, and
[09:05.980 --> 09:06.980]  then I'll get it going in there.
[09:06.980 --> 09:11.540]  I'll veg it until it is maybe six inches tall, maybe eight inches tall.
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.560]  Kind of just depends on what I'm going for.
[09:13.560 --> 09:18.300]  If it is something that I think I'm going to keep, I will veg it until it is just large
[09:18.300 --> 09:19.480]  enough to get a clone.
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.920]  Once that top node, that center branch creates a big enough shoot to get a clone from, I'll
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.120]  cut that clone.
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.720]  As soon as I am confident that that clone is going to root, I will flip my plants.
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.680]  There's no need to get it any bigger.
[09:31.680 --> 09:33.360]  Being the breeder, I've got plenty of seeds.
[09:33.360 --> 09:35.560]  I just want to see what I've created at this point.
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.440]  Those seeds came out of the greenhouse run.
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.560]  Nobody knows what we've made.
[09:38.560 --> 09:42.960]  We need to find out what they are, find out if they're, like I said, mutants, intersex
[09:43.360 --> 09:45.520]  mutants, pure trash, or maybe they're fucking magic.
[09:45.520 --> 09:46.960]  I've got to find that out.
[09:46.960 --> 09:50.800]  I just want to grow them as quickly as possible and discover what I've done.
[09:50.800 --> 09:53.320]  I'll get them going in a small pot, veg them up.
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.520]  I don't need the clones because I've got a lot more seeds and that's not my goal right
[09:56.520 --> 09:57.520]  now anyway.
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.200]  I'll just get them growing.
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.320]  As soon as they're ... Sometimes I'll do it four inches, five inches, maybe even just
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.600]  six inches tall.
[10:04.600 --> 10:06.240]  Then I'll flip them into flower.
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.560]  When I was working in a commercial environment and I could have basically unlimited plants,
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.680]  I have these little trays and those trays can fit 24 cups per tray.
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.040]  I could fit two of those trays comfortably under a 600 watt light.
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.800]  I would start 50 seeds and then by the time I was done pulling the males or whatever,
[10:23.800 --> 10:26.240]  I'd have one solid tray.
[10:26.240 --> 10:29.080]  Usually I'd use the two trays and spread them out, but I'd have one solid tray worth of
[10:29.080 --> 10:32.640]  females that I could grow out and see what I've got to work with.
[10:32.640 --> 10:34.240]  That worked really well under that light.
[10:34.240 --> 10:36.800]  Then I would just grow them and start taking pictures.
[10:36.800 --> 10:37.800]  Don't manipulate them.
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.120]  Don't do anything to them because I simply want to see what these plants are.
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.000]  I may grow them under different conditions, different environments.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  I may top them.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  I may trellis them.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.560]  I may scrog them out later in the future in different runs once they make the cut.
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.400]  Right now, I don't know what these plants are.
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.280]  I don't want to waste more than a few weeks, more than a few square feet, more than a few
[10:58.280 --> 11:02.120]  kilowatts, more than a few cups of dirt on plants that I don't know if they could be
[11:02.120 --> 11:03.720]  complete garbage.
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.800]  I'll put them in the cups, put them in a small pot, veg them out, flip them, then start taking
[11:07.800 --> 11:09.600]  pictures and a lot of, lot of notes.
[11:09.600 --> 11:10.680]  I just label them.
[11:10.680 --> 11:11.800]  I'll have rows.
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.920]  Plant A or sometimes I do weird shit like I kind of code it based on what I'm working
[11:15.920 --> 11:16.920]  with.
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.120]  If it was a rise, I would say a rise F3 number and then it would just be numbered down the
[11:21.120 --> 11:24.680]  row 1 through 12 or 1 through 25 or whatever.
[11:24.680 --> 11:25.680]  Then I would make a lot of notes.
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.040]  A rise number, a rise F3 number 22 really looks crazy good.
[11:30.040 --> 11:31.040]  Keep an eye on that.
[11:31.040 --> 11:33.240]  Number 36 is going to be a male at a super tall.
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.240]  I could tell.
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.120]  I'm going to keep notes and then react to how they get fed, feed everything exactly
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.720]  the same, treat everything exactly the same and then see what these plants do.
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.800]  What am I looking for?
[11:43.800 --> 11:46.920]  I'm looking for a number one thing is problems.
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.360]  I don't want to send out problematic seeds to customers.
[11:50.360 --> 11:53.520]  That's a good way to ruin a business, ruin friendships.
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.840]  That's just shitty to do.
[11:54.840 --> 11:56.560]  I'm all about making quality shit.
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.800]  So I want to make sure that we're not finding any problems is the first thing to look for.
[12:00.800 --> 12:02.600]  Do they germinate well is my first thing.
[12:02.600 --> 12:03.920]  Do they germ well?
[12:04.600 --> 12:05.600]  Once they germ, how do they react?
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.440]  Once I put them into dirt, do they sprout up?
[12:07.440 --> 12:08.440]  Do they damp off?
[12:08.440 --> 12:09.440]  Do they have any weird problems?
[12:09.440 --> 12:11.040]  Then we look for mutants.
[12:11.040 --> 12:12.680]  Do they do any weird shit as they grow?
[12:12.680 --> 12:17.720]  Look for growth anomalies, different ploidy features, different leaf shapes, different
[12:17.720 --> 12:18.720]  what's going to happen?
[12:18.720 --> 12:19.720]  Are they are they limpy?
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.720]  Are they wimpy?
[12:20.720 --> 12:22.280]  Are they wispy is the word I'm trying to say.
[12:22.280 --> 12:23.720]  Are they just weak plants in general?
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.640]  Do they grow like fucking crazy?
[12:25.640 --> 12:26.640]  What are they going to show me?
[12:26.640 --> 12:27.640]  I want to find out.
[12:27.640 --> 12:29.400]  Take a lot of notes and a lot of pictures.
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.880]  Start snapping those pictures around week three all the way up until harvest.
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.520]  Get a good catalog of photos of every phenotype that you find.
[12:36.520 --> 12:39.920]  Then if you've got a bunch of good stuff, you know, I know I've got good stuff, then
[12:39.920 --> 12:41.240]  I can send it out to you guys.
[12:41.240 --> 12:44.080]  Now you want to do this to kind of find your keepers.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.540]  I would recommend growing them maybe in a one gallon pot.
[12:47.540 --> 12:50.280]  Get them as big as until you can get a clone off of them.
[12:50.280 --> 12:51.920]  Like I said, cut that clone.
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.760]  As soon as you see that clone, take root, then flip your plants that are in the pot.
[12:56.760 --> 13:00.640]  Then that way you've got a clone going for backup and you've got a plant going.
[13:00.640 --> 13:02.680]  Immediately you can identify the males.
[13:02.680 --> 13:05.780]  About 10, 12 days away, you can identify the males.
[13:05.780 --> 13:08.520]  Pull the male plants out of there, unless you're looking for a male.
[13:08.520 --> 13:10.560]  Most people are not looking for a boy plant.
[13:10.560 --> 13:12.000]  Pull the dudes out of there.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.080]  Also go to your clone dome or your cloning machine.
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.160]  Get all the dudes out of there as well because you know that plant number 32 and clone number
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.160]  32, those are both boys.
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.160]  They got to go.
[13:21.160 --> 13:23.700]  Now you're just narrowing it down to the awesome females.
[13:23.700 --> 13:27.200]  Now once you get done removing all the males and sexing all these plants, probably by day
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.440]  14, hopefully by day 17, you've gotten all the dudes out of there, maybe even earlier.
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.200]  Now what we're looking for is stellar females.
[13:35.200 --> 13:36.840]  You've got clones of everybody.
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.320]  When you start seeing girls that really stand out, maybe there's one with an amazing growth
[13:40.320 --> 13:41.640]  structure.
[13:41.640 --> 13:43.640]  Maybe the one that's got the traits you're looking for.
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.040]  I don't know what you're after, but when you see that, start taking notes and be like,
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.840]  this one's going to finish way earlier.
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.440]  Plant 13, the one that I thought would be unlucky that's supposed to be the unlucky
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.900]  plant, that one's going to finish early.
[13:54.900 --> 13:58.980]  Take a note in your notebook over here and hope that clone number 13 is rooted well.
[13:58.980 --> 14:02.740]  By this time, you have got your clones out of your clone dome, your clone machine, however
[14:02.740 --> 14:03.740]  you do it.
[14:03.740 --> 14:07.820]  You've got them into the small cups and they're now vegging to be your next run.
[14:07.820 --> 14:11.740]  By the time you finish this first crop over here, these have been up potted and they are
[14:11.740 --> 14:12.860]  ready to go.
[14:12.860 --> 14:14.460]  You've got another run to go.
[14:14.460 --> 14:17.760]  You get to grow all the females one more time.
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.400]  Take clones of your favorite two.
[14:19.400 --> 14:21.260]  There will probably be two.
[14:21.260 --> 14:24.780]  There'll be one that you really like as the grower and one that a lot of other people
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.340]  like as the consumer.
[14:26.340 --> 14:29.880]  They don't realize that that one that they love was a pain in the ass to grow.
[14:29.880 --> 14:32.340]  They want a bunch of it and you're going to be like, I don't want to grow that shit again
[14:32.340 --> 14:33.340]  because it sucked.
[14:33.340 --> 14:35.220]  There's going to be one that you really love.
[14:35.220 --> 14:37.840]  Pick the one that you really like.
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.140]  Let me make sure I cover that because I didn't have any notes.
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.580]  I just freestyled that because I think I'm good at talking about this.
[14:44.580 --> 14:45.660]  Run them in small pots, bro.
[14:45.660 --> 14:46.920]  Just run them small.
[14:46.920 --> 14:48.620]  Get a clone as soon as you can.
[14:48.620 --> 14:50.340]  I don't know how good you are at cloning.
[14:50.340 --> 14:53.640]  As soon as you can get a clone off of that plant, snip a clone.
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.040]  As soon as you see roots on that clone and you are confident you've got a survivor, flower
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.440]  those other plants.
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.440]  Keep an eye on them.
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.760]  Pull the boys as soon as you can.
[15:01.760 --> 15:03.620]  Get the big plant and the clone.
[15:03.620 --> 15:05.480]  Get them out of there immediately.
[15:05.480 --> 15:06.560]  Keep an eye on the females.
[15:06.560 --> 15:07.740]  Keep a lot of good notes.
[15:07.740 --> 15:09.320]  Decide which one you like.
[15:09.320 --> 15:10.940]  Treat all of them exactly the same.
[15:10.940 --> 15:14.260]  How are you going to know which one is good if you treated one differently than the other?
[15:14.260 --> 15:18.300]  The one that you gave the other microbes to is going to come out better.
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.200]  So treat them all the same.
[15:20.200 --> 15:21.200]  Dry them.
[15:21.200 --> 15:22.200]  Cure them.
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.860]  Treat them all the same.
[15:23.860 --> 15:26.580]  You might want to, I don't know, this is up to you.
[15:26.580 --> 15:29.800]  Sometimes I cut down all of the plants at the end of week 10.
[15:29.800 --> 15:32.820]  Sometimes I kind of keep an eye on them and I let some go a little bit longer.
[15:32.820 --> 15:36.540]  Is that cheating testing or is that doing what needs to be done to each phenotype to
[15:36.540 --> 15:38.320]  maximize its potential?
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.320]  That is up to you.
[15:39.320 --> 15:42.620]  At the end, either decide do we whack them all at the end of week 9, at the end of week
[15:42.620 --> 15:45.640]  10 or do you pay attention to the trichomes?
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.480]  That kind of depends on if you're a commercial grower, like in a big facility, they've got
[15:49.480 --> 15:51.280]  to be done by the end of week 10.
[15:51.280 --> 15:52.280]  Usually week 9.
[15:52.280 --> 15:54.360]  If not, they're coming down by week 10.
[15:54.360 --> 15:56.960]  So we've got to cut them and see what they do at that point.
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.520]  If you're a personal grower that can manage, they can go as long as you want.
[16:00.520 --> 16:02.220]  You're in charge of that time frame.
[16:02.220 --> 16:04.960]  Maybe let them go and see what they do if you let them go to week 11.
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.480]  I generally like to let new shit go until day 70, at least 70 days because you never
[16:11.480 --> 16:12.480]  know.
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.960]  Maybe at the end that last week, if you cut it down to day 63, sometimes around day 65,
[16:16.960 --> 16:20.320]  67, plants really go shebang kaboom and really beef up.
[16:20.360 --> 16:23.240]  So I like to let them go 70 days that first run.
[16:23.240 --> 16:24.240]  That's up to you.
[16:24.240 --> 16:27.400]  That is up to your preferences, your garden, what you're looking for.
[16:27.400 --> 16:32.760]  If you've already made a determination by day 55 that that is not the plant you want,
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.480]  have no fear to cut it down and get rid of it early if that's what you want to do or
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.360]  finish it, dry it, cure it, smoke it and enjoy it as usable product.
[16:40.360 --> 16:41.760]  But it's only going to be...
[16:41.760 --> 16:44.360]  Now here's something I've got to mention.
[16:44.360 --> 16:50.200]  These first test runs are not meant to be big time cash crop, pay the bills, get rich
[16:50.200 --> 16:51.200]  runs.
[16:51.200 --> 16:52.200]  These are test runs.
[16:52.200 --> 16:53.480]  These are auditions.
[16:53.480 --> 16:54.920]  These are selector runs.
[16:54.920 --> 16:56.960]  These are pheno hunts is what these are.
[16:56.960 --> 17:00.400]  We are looking for the keeper in the pack that works the best with you.
[17:00.400 --> 17:02.160]  I kind of describe it like this.
[17:02.160 --> 17:05.280]  You know that there's something in that pack of seeds that is desirable.
[17:05.280 --> 17:08.840]  You read the description on the website and you scroll through a bunch of stuff and you
[17:08.840 --> 17:10.800]  decided on this one thing.
[17:10.800 --> 17:12.400]  This is the pack of seeds that I want.
[17:12.400 --> 17:13.680]  So you ordered that.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  You know there's going to be something in that pack.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.840]  Most of them are going to be close to what you want.
[17:17.840 --> 17:22.160]  Now you've just got to find the one that is in there that is really good for you.
[17:22.160 --> 17:24.560]  We've agreed on Italian food, right?
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.040]  Most of us can agree on Italian food or Mexican food, but today we're going to go with Italian
[17:28.040 --> 17:29.040]  food.
[17:29.040 --> 17:30.200]  We've agreed on Italian food.
[17:30.200 --> 17:31.560]  We've gotten to the restaurant.
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.560]  We know we're that far.
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.720]  The seed pack came.
[17:33.720 --> 17:34.720]  You've got the seed pack.
[17:34.720 --> 17:37.060]  Now when you get the phenotypes, that is the menu.
[17:37.060 --> 17:38.240]  Do you want the marinara?
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.240]  Do you want the alfredo?
[17:39.240 --> 17:41.080]  Do you want the eggplant?
[17:41.080 --> 17:42.960]  Excuse me for the scratchy throat.
[17:43.320 --> 17:45.800]  We've agreed that we want the Italian food.
[17:45.800 --> 17:46.960]  That's the pack of seeds that you got.
[17:46.960 --> 17:50.920]  Now you've got to open up the menu and see which menu item is perfect for you.
[17:50.920 --> 17:52.600]  Those are going to be your phenotypes.
[17:52.600 --> 17:53.920]  Hopefully you get the dessert.
[17:53.920 --> 17:55.120]  Just start with dessert, bro.
[17:55.120 --> 17:56.120]  That's the way to do it.
[17:56.120 --> 17:59.960]  Anyway, I hope you heard my stomach ramble, rumble as I was rambling about food.
[17:59.960 --> 18:02.480]  I was not hungry until I said Italian food.
[18:02.480 --> 18:05.480]  My mouth and stomach just totally growled into this microphone.
[18:05.480 --> 18:06.840]  That was funny.
[18:06.840 --> 18:11.440]  So I hope I explained that well because really run them quick, run them small so that we
[18:11.440 --> 18:13.960]  don't waste a lot of time, space, and energy.
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.560]  Like I said, this is not a cash crop.
[18:15.560 --> 18:17.480]  This is an audition crop.
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.880]  We're trying to find the keeper out of this pack.
[18:19.880 --> 18:24.440]  Then the next couple of runs, we're going to establish a relationship with the keeper
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.640]  in that seed pack.
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.040]  We want to find the perfect plant for us.
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.080]  I said before, pick two because there are always two.
[18:33.080 --> 18:37.320]  Most of the time, a lot of the times, it's plants number two and four for me.
[18:37.320 --> 18:38.880]  I don't know why it works out that way.
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.120]  Two, four, and nine are always the champs.
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.920]  If I number them one through 12 or there's a lot of times 12 seeds in a pack or whatever,
[18:45.920 --> 18:46.920]  I'll do 12.
[18:46.920 --> 18:50.720]  One through one, two, four, and nine are quite often the fucking champions.
[18:50.720 --> 18:52.760]  So you're going to find two or three that you like.
[18:52.760 --> 18:55.280]  Run them again because you've got those clones.
[18:55.280 --> 18:57.760]  Make sure you keep cutting clones every time you put them into flower.
[18:57.760 --> 19:01.080]  So you're going to cut a clone, put them into flower, cut clones, put them into flower.
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.480]  Keep those clones so you've always got a mother plant.
[19:03.480 --> 19:06.920]  But run them until you find the one that you really, really like.
[19:06.920 --> 19:10.760]  Then that is going to be your production crop, the one that supplies your medicine, pays
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.040]  your bills, whatever your goal is, you've got to find the perfect one.
[19:14.040 --> 19:15.320]  There's work to be done.
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.960]  A lot of people don't realize or don't want to do that early work to find the perfect
[19:19.960 --> 19:20.960]  phenotype.
[19:20.960 --> 19:24.040]  They think they're going to jump in and have a cash crop and have profitable product the
[19:24.040 --> 19:25.440]  first run.
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.040]  You can do that, but ideally, you would do an audition process, find the first one, especially
[19:30.040 --> 19:32.240]  if you're going to put this keeper outdoors.
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.800]  I would run it indoors through the winter and then have a clone ready in the springtime
[19:36.800 --> 19:40.380]  to put out there so you know what's going to do the best outdoors.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.380]  Find the one with the good structure to hold up from the wind.
[19:43.380 --> 19:45.700]  Find the one that puts out a bunch of good flowers.
[19:45.700 --> 19:49.300]  Find the one that's not intersex or a male so you don't put an intersex or a male plant
[19:49.300 --> 19:51.500]  outdoors and fuck up the whole neighborhood.
[19:51.500 --> 19:54.380]  But this is an audition process and it can happen very quickly.
[19:54.380 --> 20:01.020]  We don't want to waste lights, electricity, time, space, energy, soil, real estate, numbers.
[20:01.020 --> 20:04.380]  A lot of us are limited on plant count numbers.
[20:04.380 --> 20:08.620]  You've noticed that my breeding projects have slowed down because I am very limited on plant
[20:08.780 --> 20:11.380]  count numbers here in the state of Colorado.
[20:11.380 --> 20:14.580]  Back in the day for a little while, they let us just fucking put plants wherever you could
[20:14.580 --> 20:15.620]  cram them into the house.
[20:15.620 --> 20:18.020]  You could go to the doctor and say, my back hurts.
[20:18.020 --> 20:19.740]  I need 50 plants for my back hurting.
[20:19.740 --> 20:21.700]  Then you just say my arm hurts.
[20:21.700 --> 20:23.180]  They'd write you another 30 plants for that.
[20:23.180 --> 20:25.220]  They'd write you all kinds of recommendations.
[20:25.220 --> 20:29.820]  And then allegedly you have 125 plant count, which I would never go over 100 because that's
[20:29.820 --> 20:31.100]  when you get in huge trouble.
[20:31.100 --> 20:34.500]  But back in the day, we'd have 99 plants in some rooms at some houses.
[20:34.500 --> 20:39.260]  And now I'm limited to 12, which most of the time ends up as 11 because I've got a
[20:39.260 --> 20:43.460]  male plant that after he does his work around day 25, he gets cut down.
[20:43.460 --> 20:46.380]  So I'm kind of wasting a fucking plant count with that male plant.
[20:46.380 --> 20:48.820]  I've got an empty space half the time just because of that.
[20:48.820 --> 20:52.940]  Anyway, my ramble, the point is that numbers are big, so you can cut down plants that you
[20:52.940 --> 20:55.580]  don't need early and save on numbers.
[20:55.580 --> 21:00.340]  Because here in Colorado, I get my six medical cannabis plants because I have a medical cannabis
[21:00.340 --> 21:03.380]  card and then I get my six adult use plants.
[21:03.380 --> 21:07.700]  They're limited to 12 per household, per resident, per person basically.
[21:07.700 --> 21:09.580]  So that's what I'm allowed to do.
[21:09.580 --> 21:10.820]  That's why my breeding is slowed down.
[21:10.820 --> 21:14.980]  You guys used to see me put out a lot more shit until they changed the rules on us.
[21:14.980 --> 21:19.340]  And then COVID really slowed me down because I'm not doing the commercial contracting and
[21:19.340 --> 21:20.980]  consulting which I was doing.
[21:20.980 --> 21:25.140]  A lot of times I would trade commercial consulting for space in your grow.
[21:25.140 --> 21:28.860]  I'd be like, well, I need to test run a thousand seeds in here and then I'll come consult for
[21:28.860 --> 21:31.060]  your grow while that's happening and that would be a good trade.
[21:31.620 --> 21:35.460]  Not doing that now because COVID kind of put everybody on a skeleton crew.
[21:35.460 --> 21:36.460]  I am rambling.
[21:36.460 --> 21:39.140]  I'm going to skim this message and make sure I got it.
[21:39.140 --> 21:40.700]  Grow them small because we don't want to waste space.
[21:40.700 --> 21:42.240]  Get a clone, flip them.
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.980]  See if you like it before you grow a big.
[21:44.980 --> 21:49.940]  Then this will reloot me around to a podcast episode I did about outdoor plants.
[21:49.940 --> 21:54.700]  Then you won't be that person putting gigantic plants outdoors that you find out late in
[21:54.700 --> 21:59.420]  the season that you've been vegging this nine foot tall fucking plant and it's a boy.
[21:59.420 --> 22:01.220]  This is a good way to prevent that sort of stuff.
[22:01.220 --> 22:04.100]  Grow them small, turn them, burn them, get them out of there.
[22:04.100 --> 22:06.660]  Don't expect that first crop to be a cash crop.
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.460]  You will pay yourself back.
[22:08.460 --> 22:09.620]  You'll pay for your electricity.
[22:09.620 --> 22:10.620]  You'll pay for all your bills.
[22:10.620 --> 22:12.780]  You'll pay for the seeds over time.
[22:12.780 --> 22:15.020]  This is not going to be the last crop you'll ever grow.
[22:15.020 --> 22:17.680]  This is the first crop you're going to grow from these seeds.
[22:17.680 --> 22:18.680]  You're going to build a relationship.
[22:18.680 --> 22:22.220]  Then you're going to grow this plant like a fucking champion.
[22:22.220 --> 22:23.220]  Find a keeper.
[22:23.220 --> 22:27.120]  Then once you found the keeper, pop another pack of seeds until you've got a room full
[22:27.120 --> 22:30.040]  of keepers that max out your mother plant space.
[22:30.040 --> 22:31.040]  All right.
[22:31.040 --> 22:32.560]  I do have one more question here in front of me.
[22:32.560 --> 22:34.760]  This one came from our friend used to be cool.
[22:34.760 --> 22:37.560]  We hear from used to be cool quite frequently on this podcast.
[22:37.560 --> 22:39.700]  Big up to my buddy used to be cool, bro.
[22:39.700 --> 22:42.120]  You're messaging us and you're listening to the show.
[22:42.120 --> 22:43.760]  You must still be cool in my opinion.
[22:43.760 --> 22:46.040]  All right, let's get right to the point because I'm rambling.
[22:46.040 --> 22:52.000]  It says my recent bout with spider mites during flower and inability to completely get rid
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.920]  of the devils made me think of this as a possible remedy.
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.880]  I thought your vast experience, you may have heard someone trying this and you might know
[23:00.880 --> 23:04.080]  whether it would work or just be destructive to the plants.
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.080]  He's getting to a point.
[23:05.080 --> 23:07.080]  I'm the one rambling and stumbling through this.
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.080]  Not our friend used to be cool.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.520]  I didn't read this very well.
[23:09.520 --> 23:14.520]  It says, can spider mites be removed with a shop vac or other vacuum?
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.280]  I thought about trying it, but I was afraid it might remove the mites along with all of
[23:18.280 --> 23:19.280]  the foliage.
[23:19.280 --> 23:24.160]  Also, I had one arise plant, which was least affected of all of the plants.
[23:24.160 --> 23:28.440]  Thanks for any insight you can provide from your friend used to be cool.
[23:28.440 --> 23:33.080]  My favorite part about that is that the arise plant didn't get attacked by the spider mites.
[23:33.080 --> 23:35.760]  Something in there told those mites, I don't want to go there.
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.360]  Arise stood in the corner, not getting eaten up.
[23:38.360 --> 23:40.160]  Everybody else was getting a feast.
[23:40.160 --> 23:41.160]  Big up to arise.
[23:41.160 --> 23:42.160]  All right, let's talk about this.
[23:42.160 --> 23:46.760]  A shop vac for spider mites or any other type of vacuum.
[23:46.760 --> 23:54.240]  Yes, you can use a shop vac for spider mites, but think about when you get the shop vac
[23:54.240 --> 23:57.320]  running, there's that exhaust coming out of the other side, right?
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.360]  If you don't have proper filtration, are you just shooting those spider mites down the
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.560]  hall?
[24:01.560 --> 24:05.640]  We would use a shop vac in a commercial grow to just clean up the floor and shit.
[24:05.640 --> 24:08.320]  Then I could see that exhaust shooting the leaves.
[24:08.320 --> 24:11.560]  I thought, well, anything that's coming out of that vacuum is just going down the hall
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.620]  to all of the other grow rooms right now.
[24:13.620 --> 24:17.300]  You can see the leaves just rustling from that exhaust.
[24:17.300 --> 24:22.220]  Are you shooting spider mites just all over the place now from one section to the other?
[24:22.220 --> 24:23.360]  That would be my first thought.
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.820]  If you've got proper filtration, which it's got to be a small, tiny filter, a very tiny
[24:27.820 --> 24:31.380]  micron filter to catch a spider mite.
[24:31.380 --> 24:37.120]  You can definitely use it, positivity, you can use it to suck off webs.
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.380]  You can use it to remove the web.
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.700]  I should have said it that way.
[24:39.700 --> 24:43.380]  You can use the shop vac to remove the spider webs.
[24:43.420 --> 24:47.260]  If your spider mites have gotten out of control and you've got little tents happening, you
[24:47.260 --> 24:51.300]  can get up there and just put the shop vac or a regular vacuum right on there, suck those
[24:51.300 --> 24:52.300]  webs right off.
[24:52.300 --> 24:53.300]  That will work.
[24:53.300 --> 24:56.980]  Then use a rubber glove and a paper towel and just wipe the rest of that shit off of
[24:56.980 --> 24:57.980]  there.
[24:57.980 --> 25:00.980]  You're going to do some damage to the trichomes, but it's better than having a bunch of spider
[25:00.980 --> 25:02.240]  mites on there.
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.900]  The question about removing foliage, that just depends on how hard you've got the flow
[25:06.900 --> 25:08.580]  be turned up, bro.
[25:08.580 --> 25:12.380]  If that thing's really sucking and you've got a powerful vacuum with a smaller hole,
[25:12.380 --> 25:14.340]  it may suck off some of the foliage.
[25:14.340 --> 25:18.620]  It may do some leaf damage, but that foliage is where the spider mites are hanging out
[25:18.620 --> 25:19.620]  and living anyway.
[25:19.620 --> 25:24.180]  So you may be killing two birds with one stone and doing two jobs at one time.
[25:24.180 --> 25:27.220]  You're defoliating and getting rid of the mites.
[25:27.220 --> 25:30.460]  This is something that I have done with whiteflies.
[25:30.460 --> 25:32.660]  I had whiteflies in a grow tent.
[25:32.660 --> 25:36.180]  The grow was at a point where I couldn't treat it with any sprayed pesticides or anything
[25:36.180 --> 25:37.180]  like that.
[25:37.180 --> 25:42.340]  So I got my normal house vacuum and I put the long wand attachment on the hose and I
[25:42.340 --> 25:48.780]  had the shop vac on and I had a long stick and I would just smack the plants with the
[25:48.780 --> 25:52.420]  vacuum attachment and then use a stick to keep annoying the bugs.
[25:52.420 --> 25:55.160]  And as they flew out, I just fucking shop vac them off the light because they all went
[25:55.160 --> 25:56.260]  straight to the light.
[25:56.260 --> 25:57.700]  Just shop vac them right off of there.
[25:57.700 --> 26:01.100]  And then as they would land, I just rattled the plants again and just go shop vac them
[26:01.100 --> 26:02.100]  or vac them up.
[26:02.100 --> 26:06.100]  So this will be effective, but keep in mind that they have to go somewhere.
[26:06.100 --> 26:11.060]  If they're not getting caught in like a sort of a canister or a vacuum bag or something,
[26:11.060 --> 26:12.900]  are they getting shot out of the back of the vacuum?
[26:12.900 --> 26:15.180]  I don't know what kind of vac you're using.
[26:15.180 --> 26:17.220]  That is just something I would really think about.
[26:17.220 --> 26:19.900]  It does blow exhaust out of a lot of vacuums.
[26:19.900 --> 26:22.900]  Like a lot of shop vacs have an exhaust on the other end.
[26:22.900 --> 26:23.940]  Where is it going to go?
[26:23.940 --> 26:25.260]  But it could be effective.
[26:25.260 --> 26:29.380]  The other part about ruining your plants, if you got mites that bad, get in there and
[26:29.380 --> 26:30.380]  see what it does, bro.
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.180]  The vacuum is not going to be much worse than what those mites are doing.
[26:34.180 --> 26:37.100]  I think that answers this question.
[26:37.100 --> 26:41.900]  If you do this, get rid of the contents of that vacuum.
[26:41.900 --> 26:46.980]  If it's a bag, a canister, maybe take the whole shop vac out to the woods and light
[26:46.980 --> 26:48.500]  that thing on fire.
[26:48.500 --> 26:52.460]  Keep in mind that thing's filled with fucking problems.
[26:52.460 --> 26:53.460]  Get rid of it.
[26:53.460 --> 26:58.420]  If you can burn it, like seriously, if you've got a fire pit, burn that fucking thing because
[26:58.420 --> 27:00.780]  those bugs are going to scatter wherever they go.
[27:00.780 --> 27:05.380]  That place now has a spider mite infestation like level 12 because they're just in a little
[27:05.380 --> 27:06.380]  bag.
[27:06.380 --> 27:07.380]  You just put them in there.
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.380]  They're breeding in there.
[27:08.380 --> 27:09.380]  They're partying in there.
[27:09.380 --> 27:10.380]  There are boys and girls in there.
[27:10.380 --> 27:13.300]  Now there are babies in there and those babies are having babies.
[27:13.300 --> 27:15.500]  Spider mites reproduce quite quickly.
[27:15.500 --> 27:17.220]  Whatever you do, get rid of that canister.
[27:17.220 --> 27:20.300]  Do keep in mind that that vacuum is now filled with problems.
[27:20.300 --> 27:25.780]  Whatever happens to that vacuum, the canister, the vacuum bag, make sure you are very responsible
[27:25.780 --> 27:30.420]  and proactive with what you do with that so we don't spread those problems to our friends.
[27:30.420 --> 27:33.540]  You don't want to get rid of them in your grow and then just take them across town to
[27:33.540 --> 27:38.420]  another place and cause a problem there or across the yard, across the lawn, across the
[27:38.420 --> 27:39.420]  whatever.
[27:39.420 --> 27:40.740]  Don't spread those spider mites.
[27:40.740 --> 27:41.740]  They may just come back.
[27:41.740 --> 27:45.980]  If you just put them in the trash can outside, they'll find their way back to the grow eventually.
[27:45.980 --> 27:49.420]  Maybe not today, but they're going to go to the bushes outside, then to your shoes, then
[27:49.420 --> 27:51.180]  right back into your grow.
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.820]  Let's get rid of them as far as we can.
[27:52.820 --> 27:57.460]  I jokingly said burn it with fire, but if that's an option, burn it with fire.
[27:57.460 --> 27:58.460]  All right.
[27:58.460 --> 27:59.980]  I want to thank you, my friend.
[27:59.980 --> 28:01.660]  Used to be cool for a great message.
[28:01.660 --> 28:03.020]  Yes, be creative.
[28:03.020 --> 28:07.180]  Use that shop vac if that is what you've got to do, but make sure you get rid of all
[28:07.180 --> 28:10.020]  those mites and mite carcasses.
[28:10.020 --> 28:14.140]  This also works great for aphids, white flies, fungus gnats.
[28:14.140 --> 28:19.780]  You could do this with if you've got an abundance of bugs and bug mites, bug webs, this would
[28:19.780 --> 28:20.780]  work.
[28:20.780 --> 28:23.180]  However, I really hope you got to it before it got to that.
[28:23.180 --> 28:27.380]  The important part is that you learn why it got that bad and learn to never let it get
[28:27.380 --> 28:28.900]  that bad again.
[28:28.900 --> 28:34.500]  You get one pass at getting it that destructively bad, but next time we're going to make fun
[28:34.500 --> 28:35.500]  of you.
[28:35.500 --> 28:37.660]  Next time you got to think about what you're doing.
[28:37.660 --> 28:38.660]  Don't let it happen again.
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.980]  That's a scolding from Ross to Jeff, a polite, gentle scolding.
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.100]  You get one pass.
[28:42.100 --> 28:46.300]  Next time you're doing pushups in the iry army, you got to do a big dab and then try
[28:46.300 --> 28:48.020]  to do 10 pushups.
[28:48.020 --> 28:50.460]  I'm not sure if that's punishment or pleasure to some people.
[28:50.460 --> 28:51.460]  All right.
[28:51.460 --> 28:53.260]  I'm getting rambly, so it is time to wrap up this episode.
[28:53.260 --> 28:59.060]  Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,

[30:10.140 --> 30:13.780]  That will begin on November 25th and go through the end of the month.
[30:13.780 --> 30:15.260]  That is really all I've got for you.

[30:17.900 --> 30:20.940]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend Danny Potts.
