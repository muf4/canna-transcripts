[00:05.950 --> 00:25.300]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.300 --> 00:26.940]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:26.940 --> 00:27.940]  I'm your host.
[00:27.940 --> 00:29.740]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.740 --> 00:35.000]  This is episode 722 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.460]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of listener emails.

[01:48.460 --> 01:52.220]  stash seed exchange event in Denver, Colorado.
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.220]  That's right.
[01:53.220 --> 01:57.900]  Saturday, March 26, there will be a seed event in Denver, Colorado.

[02:22.980 --> 02:24.120]  seed event.
[02:24.120 --> 02:26.300]  I do hope you hope to see you there in Denver.
[02:26.300 --> 02:30.100]  I should have some great things with me some brand new stuff that hasn't been talked about
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.060]  has not been released.
[02:32.060 --> 02:33.060]  Come say hi.
[02:33.060 --> 02:34.060]  All right, where do we go from there?
[02:34.060 --> 02:38.420]  I do want to thank you for all of the great feedback on the past couple of episodes.
[02:38.420 --> 02:44.740]  I have gotten a lot of emails, a lot of feedback in general on the the STS mixing episode.
[02:44.740 --> 02:45.980]  I will do an update.
[02:45.980 --> 02:47.380]  There is more to be talked about.
[02:47.380 --> 02:49.180]  There were a lot of questions asked.
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.780]  There is more discussion to be had.
[02:50.780 --> 02:54.260]  I'm compiling all of those emails, all of those questions.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.980]  They're coming on YouTube, Instagram.
[02:55.980 --> 02:57.220]  They're coming from all over the place.
[02:57.220 --> 03:02.020]  It is easiest to send those to me in my email that I can find them, gather them in one place,
[03:02.020 --> 03:05.820]  print them, paperclip them together, bring them to the table, make it a podcast.
[03:06.420 --> 03:08.900]  The point is there is an update to be done.
[03:08.900 --> 03:14.500]  So in the near future, hopefully I can bang out part two of the STS video, answer some
[03:14.500 --> 03:19.940]  questions that were questions about storage, dilution rates, just a few random questions,
[03:19.940 --> 03:21.180]  how to collect the pollen.
[03:21.180 --> 03:23.580]  So we will discuss that in a future episode.
[03:23.580 --> 03:26.660]  Again, thank you for all of the feedback on that podcast.
[03:26.660 --> 03:30.860]  You guys did give me guys and gals, listeners and viewers gave me a lot of feedback.
[03:30.860 --> 03:32.140]  I do appreciate that.
[03:32.140 --> 03:33.140]  Thank you.
[03:33.140 --> 03:34.300]  That was well received.
[03:34.300 --> 03:35.740]  I do appreciate that.
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.980]  And thank you for all of the birthday love.
[03:37.980 --> 03:41.140]  I did mention that on a previous episode, it was my birthday.
[03:41.140 --> 03:42.140]  Thank you for all of the love.
[03:42.140 --> 03:43.500]  My inbox has been blowing up.
[03:43.500 --> 03:47.940]  It is still, it's a couple of days past the birthday now and the inbox is still going
[03:47.940 --> 03:48.940]  crazy.
[03:48.940 --> 03:49.940]  So I do appreciate that.
[03:49.940 --> 03:55.260]  I do also want to take a moment to send a big special thank you shout out to some fellow
[03:55.260 --> 03:57.340]  podcasters, some great friends of mine.
[03:57.340 --> 04:02.380]  There is a group of folks doing a podcast known as the Irie Army podcast.
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.380]  That's right.
[04:03.380 --> 04:04.940]  They are members of the Irie Army.
[04:04.940 --> 04:08.780]  The Irie Genetics crew has made their own podcast.
[04:08.780 --> 04:11.020]  They've got my blessing, my permission.
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.740]  There's no competition or anything like that.
[04:12.740 --> 04:14.940]  I love that they are doing a podcast.
[04:14.940 --> 04:18.940]  It's a bunch of my favorite friends, a bunch of my favorite people, a bunch of my community
[04:18.940 --> 04:23.500]  that myself and Graybeard and a few other people have really cultivated a nice community
[04:23.500 --> 04:26.180]  and they have put together a podcast.
[04:26.180 --> 04:31.660]  In that podcast, they feature a member of the Irie Army and interview them in a real
[04:31.660 --> 04:33.260]  friendly laid back environment.
[04:33.340 --> 04:34.340]  We're all friends.
[04:34.340 --> 04:36.180]  So it's not like a, tell me about your grow.
[04:36.180 --> 04:37.180]  It's like, what's up, bro?
[04:37.180 --> 04:38.180]  How do you grow, man?
[04:38.180 --> 04:40.620]  And it's, we're all just buddies and bros hanging out talking about the grow.
[04:40.620 --> 04:46.380]  I say we, because they have cordially and kindly invited me to be a guest on the Irie
[04:46.380 --> 04:47.900]  Army podcast.
[04:47.900 --> 04:50.900]  So next week, early next week, I will be recording with them.
[04:50.900 --> 04:54.740]  I honestly don't know if that show goes out live or if it is prerecorded and edited.
[04:54.740 --> 04:57.260]  I do think it's edited and put out at a later time.
[04:57.260 --> 05:03.420]  I will for sure let you know when my episode of the Irie Army podcast is available so that
[05:03.420 --> 05:05.980]  you can listen, you can watch, you can enjoy that.
[05:05.980 --> 05:11.140]  But in the meantime, please do go subscribe to my friends at the Irie Army podcast.
[05:11.140 --> 05:12.140]  They are on YouTube.
[05:12.140 --> 05:13.420]  They've got a great thing started.
[05:13.420 --> 05:15.380]  They're getting a good flow going.
[05:15.380 --> 05:20.420]  I want to give them a shout out and a thank you because every episode I get a lot of love.
[05:20.420 --> 05:21.740]  I get a lot of shout outs.
[05:21.740 --> 05:25.540]  My company gets a lot of love, a lot of shout outs, a lot of attention comes on myself and
[05:25.540 --> 05:27.220]  my company from that show.
[05:27.220 --> 05:28.460]  I do appreciate it.
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.540]  Thank you for the love.
[05:29.540 --> 05:33.900]  They talk about how I got them started and how I kind of inspired people and teach people
[05:33.900 --> 05:38.700]  and to hear so many people say such a wonderful stuff about me was, uh, it felt really good,
[05:38.700 --> 05:42.900]  especially right around my birthday to discover that there are about seven episodes of people
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.420]  just praising me for an hour.
[05:44.420 --> 05:45.420]  It was kind of cool.
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.420]  So I enjoyed that.
[05:46.420 --> 05:47.420]  It's not just them praising me.
[05:47.420 --> 05:50.540]  They talk a lot about their personal growth, their life, their style, but everybody does
[05:50.540 --> 05:52.740]  make sure to show me some love.
[05:53.140 --> 05:57.260]  Our boy lemur priest was on the show recently and he made sure to remind everybody that
[05:57.260 --> 05:58.500]  it was my birthday.
[05:58.500 --> 06:02.120]  Also a gray beard made sure to remind everybody that it was my birthday on the show.
[06:02.120 --> 06:07.380]  So I've been getting a tremendous amount of podcast, uh, love from the podcast community,
[06:07.380 --> 06:10.100]  birthday, love, birthday, shout outs, birthday inboxes.
[06:10.100 --> 06:12.420]  Uh, the PO box was stuffed with good shit.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.500]  My mailbox was filled with good shit.
[06:14.500 --> 06:15.580]  It's been a great week.
[06:15.580 --> 06:16.580]  So thank you guys.
[06:16.580 --> 06:17.580]  Uh, thanks.
[06:17.580 --> 06:20.860]  Uh, once the part of that was a shout out to everybody at the podcast over at the ivory
[06:20.860 --> 06:21.860]  army podcast.
[06:21.980 --> 06:26.100]  If you're behind the scenes behind the camera, behind the mic, if you're involved, good show,
[06:26.100 --> 06:27.100]  you guys, I'm proud of you.
[06:27.100 --> 06:29.500]  Um, people were like, Hey, can we do this show?
[06:29.500 --> 06:30.500]  Because we're going to use your name.
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.500]  We're going to use your people.
[06:31.500 --> 06:32.500]  And I was like, please do.
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.700]  That is awesome.
[06:33.700 --> 06:38.200]  But I think that the discord, the iry army discord is a great resource for new growers,
[06:38.200 --> 06:39.820]  for experienced growers.
[06:39.820 --> 06:42.740]  It's not only a place that I go for a grow information and grow advice.
[06:42.740 --> 06:45.180]  I go there for my social entertainment.
[06:45.180 --> 06:48.620]  Uh, during the pandemic, during the quarantine time, we couldn't go places.
[06:48.620 --> 06:52.020]  I would just jump in the discord and hang out and there would always be a dozen cool
[06:52.020 --> 06:53.020]  people in there.
[06:53.020 --> 06:56.460]  Some of my favorite people are hanging out in the discord right now.
[06:56.460 --> 07:01.340]  A couple of people that I seek guidance from a real adult advice are in the discord.
[07:01.340 --> 07:02.580]  I go there and hang out.
[07:02.580 --> 07:06.760]  So they've cultivated an amazing community for them to create a podcast from that community
[07:06.760 --> 07:11.300]  and share that and express their ideas, their views, their opinions, their experiences with
[07:11.300 --> 07:12.540]  the rest of the world.
[07:12.540 --> 07:13.980]  I fully encourage that.
[07:13.980 --> 07:17.580]  So I'm proud of my friends for creating a podcast.
[07:17.580 --> 07:19.000]  It's not even an offshoot of what I do.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.220]  It just says iry army.
[07:20.220 --> 07:21.740]  It's and it is the iry army.
[07:21.740 --> 07:22.980]  It's my friends doing a thing.
[07:22.980 --> 07:25.260]  They just happened to, and I respect the branding.
[07:25.260 --> 07:27.420]  I respect the, uh, and it's, it's community.
[07:27.420 --> 07:28.660]  I appreciate it and respect it.
[07:28.660 --> 07:30.320]  So shout out to those guys.
[07:30.320 --> 07:32.260]  And this all started with, I'm proud of you guys.
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.260]  And thanks for the birthday love.
[07:33.260 --> 07:35.700]  I went far, far too long with that.
[07:35.700 --> 07:40.300]  Uh, big up to lemur, big up to gray beard, big up to Billy, uh, big up to everybody behind
[07:40.300 --> 07:41.300]  the scenes.
[07:41.300 --> 07:44.620]  And once again, I will let you know when I'm on that show, I am scheduled to record, I
[07:44.620 --> 07:46.940]  think it's a week from yesterday or a week from today.
[07:47.300 --> 07:48.300]  I know when it is.
[07:48.300 --> 07:52.340]  Uh, but by the time this comes out, I will be, nope, I'll record the day after this comes
[07:52.340 --> 07:54.620]  out, I believe anyway, enough rambling.
[07:54.620 --> 07:56.520]  I do have some questions here in front of me.
[07:56.520 --> 07:59.620]  This podcast is already getting lengthy.
[07:59.620 --> 08:02.780]  Let's uh, let's jump into this first message.
[08:02.780 --> 08:07.240]  This one came from the man with no name that makes it easy.
[08:07.240 --> 08:09.140]  This one says hi, Ross to Jeff.
[08:09.140 --> 08:13.700]  My question is, have you ever thought about making and releasing auto flower versions
[08:13.700 --> 08:16.620]  of, for example, golden goats, sun kiss.
[08:16.620 --> 08:21.820]  He lists a lot of, uh, it says the man, he, the man with no name lists several of my strains,
[08:21.820 --> 08:23.660]  which would make great auto flowers.
[08:23.660 --> 08:28.300]  Then it says, I know, I know that with your experience, it would be a doable task.
[08:28.300 --> 08:31.780]  I am fervently, I don't know if I know what that word, I can figure out what it means,
[08:31.780 --> 08:34.460]  but I don't know if I've ever heard fervent fervor fervently.
[08:34.460 --> 08:36.500]  Yeah, that's what it says.
[08:36.500 --> 08:38.060]  Awaiting your next new drop.
[08:38.060 --> 08:39.060]  I love the show.
[08:39.060 --> 08:42.500]  I literally have listened to probably four or 500 episodes.
[08:42.500 --> 08:44.100]  Peace and love your pal.
[08:44.100 --> 08:47.300]  And then he does sign it with his name, which we will not reveal here on the show.
[08:47.300 --> 08:49.600]  Shout out to my friend, the man with no name.
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.380]  This is a great question that I do get asked quite often with all of the new States legalizing
[08:55.380 --> 09:00.580]  cannabis and all of the new growers coming on a recreational medically and even illegally.
[09:00.580 --> 09:04.620]  I do get an influx of requests for auto flower seeds.
[09:04.620 --> 09:10.740]  A lot of people teach that autos are the way, but I'm not going to discredit auto flowers.
[09:10.740 --> 09:14.060]  What I'm going to say is this, I am not into auto flowers.
[09:14.060 --> 09:16.380]  Auto flowers are not for me.
[09:16.380 --> 09:20.380]  The way I think about auto flowers is there is a time, a place in an end, an environment
[09:20.380 --> 09:25.820]  and a situation in which those plants are great for what I am doing for my goals, my
[09:25.820 --> 09:27.380]  desires, my needs.
[09:27.380 --> 09:30.020]  Auto flowers are not for me.
[09:30.020 --> 09:31.260]  They're great for other people.
[09:31.260 --> 09:32.940]  I always tell one of my favorite stories.
[09:32.940 --> 09:34.140]  I got some weird echo in the headphones.
[09:34.140 --> 09:36.720]  I apologize if that comes through in the recording, I will fix it.
[09:36.720 --> 09:37.860]  Maybe I'll just keep talking.
[09:37.980 --> 09:41.820]  I've got one of my favorite stories to tell about auto flowers because a lot of people
[09:41.820 --> 09:45.860]  do discredit and talk trash about autos, but this is a great thing that I've seen happen
[09:45.860 --> 09:47.180]  with autos.
[09:47.180 --> 09:50.420]  There was an illegal cartel grow.
[09:50.420 --> 09:52.860]  It was allegedly a Mexican cartel grow.
[09:52.860 --> 09:56.780]  They say it was a Mexican cartel because all of the food found at the campsites was all
[09:56.780 --> 10:00.500]  of the Mexican branded products.
[10:00.500 --> 10:03.540]  You could tell it was Mexican food and Mexican brands and things like that.
[10:03.540 --> 10:05.260]  I'm not even trying to generalize and be racist.
[10:05.260 --> 10:07.100]  It was a Mexican cartel grow.
[10:07.100 --> 10:11.900]  They found this grow in the middle of the national forest and they were running large
[10:11.900 --> 10:17.060]  patches of auto flower plants all through the warm season here in Colorado.
[10:17.060 --> 10:21.060]  They had, I don't even know the square footage, but we'll say hypothetically a quarter of
[10:21.060 --> 10:23.740]  an acre over here that they started today.
[10:23.740 --> 10:27.760]  Then like two weeks later, start another quarter of an acre and two weeks later, start another
[10:27.760 --> 10:30.980]  quarter of an acre and two weeks later, start another quarter.
[10:30.980 --> 10:35.240]  Then if they time it right, every two weeks, they're now pulling down a quarter of an acre
[10:35.240 --> 10:37.320]  of ganja because they're auto flowers.
[10:37.320 --> 10:38.320]  They'll grow.
[10:38.320 --> 10:39.440]  They don't have to change the sun cycle.
[10:39.440 --> 10:41.160]  The sun doesn't have to do anything differently.
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.160]  Those plants are just going to grow and flower because that's what they do.
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.120]  If they would have put photo period plants up there, they would have had to wait until
[10:49.120 --> 10:52.520]  nearly Halloween, maybe a little bit after Halloween here.
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.760]  Then they would have harvested all of it at once and it would have been a lot of work.
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.800]  Instead they threw those autos out, got them going, got those healthy, threw more out,
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.200]  threw more out, got a perpetual cycle going.
[11:02.320 --> 11:06.720]  I would assume that every time you cut down a crop, you immediately sow more seed, keep
[11:06.720 --> 11:07.720]  that pattern going.
[11:07.720 --> 11:11.600]  If you've got an eight or nine week crop and you can get those seeds reliable at eight
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.520]  or nine weeks and you can plant four squares, that turns out to about every two, two and
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.760]  a half weeks, you're pulling a crop down.
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.460]  If it's a Mexican cartel pulling down weed, they don't give a shit about that extra week.
[11:22.460 --> 11:26.600]  They want product to chop up, put in a fucking container and send it to wherever they're
[11:26.600 --> 11:27.600]  making money.
[11:27.600 --> 11:30.160]  They don't really care too much about that extra week of ripeness.
[11:30.160 --> 11:32.160]  Their customer isn't the guy going, ah, this is ... This
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.280]  could have gone another week.
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.280]  That's a different client.
[11:34.280 --> 11:36.080]  That's a different customer altogether.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.000]  They're probably pulling a crop every two weeks out there.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.440]  My point is auto flowers do have a beautiful time and place if the environment situation
[11:42.440 --> 11:44.440]  is right, but it is not for me.
[11:44.440 --> 11:46.100]  Now let me answer the main part of the question.
[11:46.100 --> 11:50.440]  The question was, will I ever consider or would I consider making auto flowers as some
[11:50.440 --> 11:52.280]  of my popular shit like the golden goat?
[11:52.280 --> 11:58.120]  They list the sun kiss, lemon Jeffrey, blueberry butcher, and more and many more it says.
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.960]  I do know how to do it essentially, but that's not for me.
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.120]  The quick answer is no.
[12:04.120 --> 12:07.680]  I will not make auto flowers of my stuff.
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.840]  Let me be clear that I said I will not.
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.960]  That does not mean that in the future I wouldn't work with another reputable breeder, big up
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.800]  to my buddy Daz at Night Owl.
[12:16.800 --> 12:19.200]  He'd be my first choice.
[12:19.200 --> 12:25.800]  That doesn't mean that I wouldn't work with somebody to maybe make an auto flower project.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.880]  All that Daz would have to do, Daz, you've got my blessing and my permission, bro.
[12:29.880 --> 12:33.720]  Maybe send me a few or let's collab and we'll do, but if you've got the seeds, you could
[12:33.720 --> 12:34.720]  do this.
[12:34.720 --> 12:35.720]  This is how cannabis works.
[12:35.720 --> 12:36.720]  This is the beauty of it.
[12:36.720 --> 12:40.920]  I couldn't stop Daz and I have no problem with Daz if he does this and I hope you hear
[12:40.920 --> 12:41.920]  this, brother.
[12:41.920 --> 12:43.240]  He could take one of my strains, anything.
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.240]  He could buy a pack of seeds.
[12:44.240 --> 12:45.480]  He could find a keeper.
[12:45.480 --> 12:48.960]  He could breed it to his autos and he could make an auto whatever I've got.
[12:48.960 --> 12:50.960]  He could make auto, I don't know, auto sun kiss.
[12:50.960 --> 12:52.040]  He could do it.
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.800]  He's got the ability, the skills.
[12:53.800 --> 12:57.560]  He's definitely further along in the auto flower game than I am so he would know how
[12:57.560 --> 13:00.880]  to breed it, what to look for, how to select it and get it there more quickly and be a
[13:00.880 --> 13:02.560]  marketable product.
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.320]  If you wanted to do it, he totally could do it and I'm going to say that I'm okay with
[13:06.320 --> 13:07.320]  that.
[13:07.320 --> 13:08.320]  I don't even need to be involved.
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.400]  If you want to cut or something, bro, I'll send you something good so that you could
[13:10.400 --> 13:14.160]  work, cut out some steps, but it wouldn't hurt my feelings.
[13:14.160 --> 13:17.080]  It wouldn't bother me because I don't make auto flowers.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.160]  It's not as a business.
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.320]  It's not going to take away from my business because I don't make autos.
[13:21.320 --> 13:24.960]  My customers don't, maybe they do want autos, but that's not, I'm not going to make them
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.720]  anyway so I'm not going to lose any sales if somebody makes an auto of my line because
[13:29.720 --> 13:31.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.520]  If I was making autos and somebody else made an auto of my line and just copied my shit,
[13:35.520 --> 13:37.480]  that's a dick move, but I'm not going to do it.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.880]  So if somebody else does, that's fair game.
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.560]  Another big factor of that is I'm not into auto flowers so I couldn't do it.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.760]  My theory, the name of the podcast is Grow From Your Heart.
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.360]  I always say grow from your heart and breed with love.
[13:48.360 --> 13:50.880]  I'm not in love with auto flowers so I would just, I wouldn't care.
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.440]  It would just be, is this good enough?
[13:52.440 --> 13:53.800]  Can we just put these out?
[13:53.800 --> 13:55.680]  And that's not what my brand is known for.
[13:55.680 --> 14:00.440]  I read genetics is known for putting out top quality shit that has been thoroughly tested.
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.720]  My testing is transparent.
[14:01.720 --> 14:05.920]  If you follow my discord server, there is a tab that says I read genetics testers and
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.600]  I encourage everybody that gets a test pack of seeds from me to go to the discord and
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.640]  post every picture you can on that server in the tester tab.
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.440]  That way we can see how many of your seeds sprouted, what they looked like when they're
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.520]  how long you veged them, what they flower like, how long they flower, the colors, the
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.920]  shapes, the textures, the trichomes.
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.000]  Like I encourage you to post everything if you're a tester.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.120]  So everything that comes from me is bred with love.
[14:30.120 --> 14:31.320]  It's thoroughly tested.
[14:31.320 --> 14:33.820]  I know that it is top shelf, top quality.
[14:33.820 --> 14:37.400]  If I were to make auto flowers, it would just be some shit that I slapped together so that
[14:37.400 --> 14:39.920]  all the people asking for auto flowers could send me their money.
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.040]  And that's not how, uh, that's not how I operate my company to be successful.
[14:44.040 --> 14:46.080]  I make things that I know are top quality.
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.080]  It doesn't go out unless it is going to be a winner, unless I want to grow it again and
[14:50.080 --> 14:52.400]  again and I'm proud of it and I want to show it off.
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.960]  And when people talk about it, they beam and they light up.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.960]  It doesn't leave here.
[14:55.960 --> 14:58.320]  It doesn't become a product in the catalog.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.920]  It gets tossed, it gets forgotten about.
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.960]  So my favorite way that I could describe it is if I were going to make auto flowers, it
[15:04.960 --> 15:07.400]  would be like playing in a country band.
[15:07.400 --> 15:08.560]  I could do it.
[15:08.560 --> 15:14.200]  I could hit the drums and it would sound like country music, but it wouldn't feel like good
[15:14.200 --> 15:15.640]  country music.
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.800]  If you got me playing some reggae music, if you got me playing some, some jam rock music
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.080]  or some straight funk, we could get down and it will feel like reggae music.
[15:24.080 --> 15:26.160]  It will feel like jam rock music.
[15:26.160 --> 15:28.560]  You got me playing rock and roll music in a rock and roll band.
[15:28.560 --> 15:31.040]  It will feel good and it will feel right.
[15:31.040 --> 15:33.340]  But if you want me to play real country, I'm not into it.
[15:33.340 --> 15:34.400]  My heart's not into it.
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.440]  I'll do it for the money, but I'm not going to do it a long time and it's not going to
[15:38.440 --> 15:39.600]  be the best it could be.
[15:39.600 --> 15:42.060]  There's somebody else out there that should do that job.
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.400]  That's how I feel about auto flowers.
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.840]  Country music is cool if you're into that.
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.400]  It's just not for me and that's how auto flowers are in my opinion.
[15:49.400 --> 15:52.560]  I often use this analogy.
[15:52.560 --> 15:55.120]  Cannabis breeders and selections are like music.
[15:55.120 --> 15:58.720]  I would obviously be the fucking reggae side of that coin.
[15:58.720 --> 16:01.060]  And then you got other breeders out there.
[16:01.060 --> 16:06.000]  Maybe one of those breeders has more of a death metal vibe and maybe another one of
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.200]  those breeders out there has like a B-52s kind of a vibe and maybe somebody out there
[16:10.200 --> 16:12.860]  is full on got that country music vibe.
[16:12.860 --> 16:16.660]  We all find a breeder that kind of speaks to us, that kind of connects with us, that
[16:16.660 --> 16:20.020]  talks in a way we enjoy and makes plants that we enjoy.
[16:20.020 --> 16:24.980]  And if I was making auto flowers, I honestly would be lying to you and ripping you off.
[16:24.980 --> 16:27.660]  I'm not the auto flower band if that makes any sense.
[16:27.660 --> 16:30.100]  I've talked enough about that.
[16:30.100 --> 16:31.740]  Big up to my buddy, the man with no name.
[16:31.740 --> 16:32.900]  I do appreciate that.
[16:32.900 --> 16:36.700]  Long story short, brother, I will not make the auto flowers myself, but that does not
[16:36.700 --> 16:41.060]  mean that somebody on my team, somebody in the crew will not make them.
[16:41.060 --> 16:44.980]  And we may one day, if they're thoroughly tested and they qualify and the consumers
[16:44.980 --> 16:47.720]  approve, we may put the Irie label on them.
[16:47.720 --> 16:53.940]  It will be transparent and well known that I didn't do it, that they were bred by a qualified,
[16:53.940 --> 16:58.660]  certified auto flower constructionist.
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.020]  I'm trying to find a fancy word for that.
[17:00.020 --> 17:01.020]  A breeder is where I'm going.
[17:01.020 --> 17:03.820]  All right, I'm going to stop talking for a minute, take a drink, then we're going to
[17:03.820 --> 17:05.420]  read the next email.
[17:05.420 --> 17:07.180]  All right, I am back.
[17:07.180 --> 17:08.180]  I am hydrated.
[17:08.180 --> 17:09.260]  My voice is lubricated.
[17:09.260 --> 17:11.780]  I'm ready to get this ramble fest going again.
[17:11.780 --> 17:16.460]  I've got an email here in front of me from somebody that who has become very familiar
[17:16.460 --> 17:17.460]  to me.
[17:17.460 --> 17:18.460]  I see your name in a lot of places.
[17:18.460 --> 17:20.700]  If I'm online, I probably see your name there.
[17:20.700 --> 17:23.640]  Big up to my buddy, Dave from Ontario.
[17:23.640 --> 17:25.300]  This message goes a lot like this.
[17:25.300 --> 17:28.500]  It says, I was just watching the thick shells episode.
[17:28.500 --> 17:32.340]  I did an episode a while back about seeds having too thick of a shell.
[17:32.340 --> 17:37.120]  It says, I thought I would contribute a question in case you thought it might make a good episode.
[17:37.120 --> 17:38.460]  This is a great question for the show.
[17:38.660 --> 17:39.660]  I do like this.
[17:39.660 --> 17:44.140]  It says, my apologies if there's already an episode on this subject.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.820]  I'm going to ramble on that.
[17:45.820 --> 17:49.540]  There's like 700 episodes and I often forget what I've done shows about.
[17:49.540 --> 17:52.820]  So if you have a question and you're like, you probably talked about that.
[17:52.820 --> 17:53.820]  Don't be afraid.
[17:53.820 --> 17:54.860]  I may have learned something.
[17:54.860 --> 17:56.220]  My opinion may have changed.
[17:56.220 --> 17:59.660]  I may have forgotten to say something on the last time I talked about it.
[17:59.660 --> 18:00.660]  Send me your question.
[18:00.660 --> 18:03.140]  Don't be shy because there are 722 episodes.
[18:03.140 --> 18:06.940]  I'm not going to make you search all the way back to episode five to find the answer.
[18:06.940 --> 18:10.220]  And if it's like a hundred episodes back, that's a year, right?
[18:10.220 --> 18:11.940]  Yeah, that's a full year.
[18:11.940 --> 18:15.260]  My education, my theory, my practices may have fully changed.
[18:15.260 --> 18:19.200]  So re-ask your new question and I may give you a completely different fucking answer
[18:19.200 --> 18:20.340]  than what I gave you last time.
[18:20.340 --> 18:21.340]  You can call me on it.
[18:21.340 --> 18:23.340]  You can see the growth experience.
[18:23.340 --> 18:24.860]  Don't be afraid to change.
[18:24.860 --> 18:28.740]  But yeah, so don't be worried if somebody's already asked the question that you've got.
[18:28.740 --> 18:32.660]  That's cool because most people I've learned don't really search through the catalog to
[18:32.660 --> 18:33.660]  find the old stuff.
[18:33.660 --> 18:35.820]  They just ask the question and hope for that I'll answer it.
[18:36.140 --> 18:37.980]  Let's get myself on track here.
[18:37.980 --> 18:40.740]  This question from my buddy Dave goes a lot like this.
[18:40.740 --> 18:44.060]  It says, I am growing Raphael and Sunkist together.
[18:44.060 --> 18:48.620]  My first iRegenetics run and I cannot wait until harvest.
[18:48.620 --> 18:49.900]  That's a great lineup together, bro.
[18:49.900 --> 18:52.020]  That's going to smell so good in that grow room.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.020]  That's going to smell like a smoothie.
[18:53.020 --> 18:56.540]  It's going to smell like a smoothie shop, a fruit stand.
[18:56.540 --> 18:58.620]  It's going to smell like a good fruit jungle.
[18:58.620 --> 19:00.380]  It's going to be beautiful in there.
[19:00.380 --> 19:02.600]  And you said, I can't wait until harvest, bro.
[19:02.600 --> 19:06.680]  Please wait until they're done, which is a good part of this, the question here.
[19:06.680 --> 19:08.880]  But a lot of people say, I can't wait, bro.
[19:08.880 --> 19:12.040]  Just wait, set your mind to, I am going to wait.
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.860]  Make it a game that you're going to wait even longer than you should.
[19:14.860 --> 19:19.320]  And then the psychology will work out to recut it down at the right time.
[19:19.320 --> 19:22.360]  A lot of people get too eager and cut down too early and disappoint themselves.
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.760]  They say, next time I'll go longer.
[19:23.760 --> 19:25.360]  Do it right the first time we'll figure it out.
[19:25.360 --> 19:26.360]  All right.
[19:26.360 --> 19:27.360]  There is more to this.
[19:27.360 --> 19:30.560]  It says, Sunkist says 50 to 60 days.
[19:30.560 --> 19:32.360]  Raphael says 65 to 70 days.
[19:33.120 --> 19:35.280]  My question is, and I like this question.
[19:35.280 --> 19:38.560]  How accurate would you consider your flowering times?
[19:38.560 --> 19:43.120]  Also, if you could comment on the flowering times versus flowering times of other breeders,
[19:43.120 --> 19:45.400]  are yours more accurate in your opinion?
[19:45.400 --> 19:48.240]  This is such a great question and a good topic.
[19:48.240 --> 19:52.800]  It says, I would be harvesting Sunkist on day, or would I be harvesting Sunkist on day
[19:52.800 --> 19:54.080]  60?
[19:54.080 --> 19:55.660]  Would it be approaching over ripeness?
[19:55.660 --> 19:59.680]  What about harvesting in the 65, 70 day range?
[19:59.680 --> 20:04.480]  And then similar question here, would harvesting Sunkist on day 50 considered harvesting too
[20:04.480 --> 20:07.160]  early even though it is in the range?
[20:07.160 --> 20:08.800]  All right.
[20:08.800 --> 20:10.000]  We've got enough of the question figured out.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.860]  I know exactly what you're asking.
[20:11.860 --> 20:14.400]  This is a really good question.
[20:14.400 --> 20:15.440]  There are two parts of the question.
[20:15.440 --> 20:17.260]  So let me jump up and get the first part.
[20:17.260 --> 20:19.400]  How accurate would you consider your flowering times?
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.940]  And I think that'll segue us into a good ramble to answer this whole question here.
[20:23.940 --> 20:28.480]  My flowering times, the flowering times which I print on my website and my official seed
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.520]  packaging.
[20:29.520 --> 20:35.160]  And you will notice that sometimes I do go and update the website because we learn through,
[20:35.160 --> 20:37.180]  let's say I put out a hundred test packs.
[20:37.180 --> 20:40.440]  That means I'm going to get 80 to 90 reports back.
[20:40.440 --> 20:44.560]  And if those people tell me it took nine to 10 weeks, we're going to put that on the package.
[20:44.560 --> 20:48.240]  But over time, people will buy the product now that we've released it.
[20:48.240 --> 20:52.680]  And now 500 people will grow it and we'll get the ratio, the options grow.
[20:52.680 --> 20:58.280]  Now that our test sample is larger, the options for more anomalies and outliers start popping
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.080]  up.
[21:00.080 --> 21:02.840]  And so sometimes with more test samples, with larger test batches, we get more data and
[21:02.840 --> 21:07.040]  we do have to adjust our flowering times.
[21:07.040 --> 21:13.060]  But I do really think that the flowering times I list on my website are mostly accurate.
[21:13.060 --> 21:14.840]  That comes from a few things.
[21:14.840 --> 21:17.140]  That comes from me growing the seeds out.
[21:17.140 --> 21:20.220]  That comes from, like I said a second ago, sending the seeds to testers.
[21:20.220 --> 21:24.560]  When I make new seeds, when I have a new batch of seeds, I'm doing it right now.
[21:24.560 --> 21:25.560]  You guys have heard me.
[21:25.560 --> 21:26.960]  I'm looking for testers.
[21:27.040 --> 21:28.560]  I'm auditioning testers.
[21:28.560 --> 21:30.820]  If you want to test seeds, let me say this again.
[21:30.820 --> 21:33.120]  Make sure you listen to the seed tester episode.
[21:33.120 --> 21:35.320]  I think it is number 590.
[21:35.320 --> 21:36.320]  Find that episode.
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.320]  Listen to that.
[21:37.320 --> 21:41.400]  Then the next thing is to join the Discord and let me know you're serious because I will
[21:41.400 --> 21:46.040]  require you to post photos on the Discord server if you are a tester.
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.040]  Where the hell was I?
[21:47.040 --> 21:48.040]  Oh, testers.
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.080]  Everybody likes to test things.
[21:49.080 --> 21:50.840]  I send a lot of test seeds out.
[21:50.840 --> 21:52.640]  I've got a lot of test seeds out there right now.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.840]  When I get new stuff, I send out testers.
[21:54.840 --> 21:58.400]  I'll probably send somewhere between 25 and 100.
[21:58.400 --> 22:01.600]  I know that's a random number, but it just depends on, honestly, how many of the seeds
[22:01.600 --> 22:04.040]  I've gotten.
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.580]  Sometimes I can see what I want right away.
[22:05.580 --> 22:07.280]  Sometimes I know exactly what I've made.
[22:07.280 --> 22:09.600]  Sometimes I'm like, I better run that a few more times.
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.640]  We've got one right now that I'm testing that I had about 20 people say it was looking good.
[22:14.640 --> 22:18.440]  One person came up with a weird anomaly that I've never seen before.
[22:18.440 --> 22:22.600]  I sent out 25 more packs just to see, like I said, numbers.
[22:22.600 --> 22:26.040]  Maybe somebody will see that again and then I have more research, more data.
[22:26.040 --> 22:27.920]  We do a lot of testing.
[22:27.920 --> 22:33.840]  My testers all have different levels of experience, different environments, different lights,
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.440]  different soil, different maybe not even soil, different cocoa, different hydro, different
[22:39.440 --> 22:42.800]  nutrients, different air conditioners, different filters.
[22:42.800 --> 22:45.600]  They've got different combinations of different setups.
[22:45.600 --> 22:49.680]  I let different people run the same seeds and then I put all of that data together.
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.760]  I get all of these grow reports and I'll put all of the ... We're just going to say
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.600]  that right now people are testing.
[22:55.600 --> 22:59.460]  Let's talk about one that finished testing just recently and that'll make it more easy
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.000]  for me to talk about a strain.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.160]  I recently was testing Bubba Cush Cross II Arise.
[23:04.160 --> 23:10.000]  It's the pre-98 Bubba Cush, the female pollinated by the male Arise King Solomon that passed
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  testing.
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.320]  It has been officially named.
[23:12.320 --> 23:14.080]  That is the Moon Tower.
[23:14.080 --> 23:15.320]  People were growing that.
[23:15.320 --> 23:17.080]  We sent out a bunch of packs of Moon Tower.
[23:17.080 --> 23:18.440]  Nobody knew what they had.
[23:18.440 --> 23:19.440]  They were growing that.
[23:19.480 --> 23:20.760]  I got a lot of feedback.
[23:20.760 --> 23:24.520]  People sent me ... Just a list of people sent me all their grow reports.
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.040]  I've got it all in an email, all on Discord.
[23:28.040 --> 23:31.680]  I just open up a little file that says Moon Tower and then I'll put your name and then
[23:31.680 --> 23:34.480]  I'll put all the details that you send me in a list.
[23:34.480 --> 23:40.800]  Then I can just see commonalities like, oh, tall, smells like pine cones, smells like
[23:40.800 --> 23:42.880]  gas, makes me lazy, gives me the giggles.
[23:42.880 --> 23:45.040]  I can find the commonalities in there.
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.920]  That's how we list our descriptions.
[23:46.920 --> 23:50.360]  It is also how I come up with flowering times.
[23:50.360 --> 23:56.720]  Cannabis is mostly going to be eight to 10 weeks, sometimes rarely less than eight weeks,
[23:56.720 --> 23:59.200]  sometimes 10, 12, 14, 16 weeks.
[23:59.200 --> 24:00.960]  Just depends on what you've got.
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.760]  I let a bunch of people run it.
[24:02.760 --> 24:05.880]  Most of the time, they give me very common reports.
[24:05.880 --> 24:09.600]  This one was done at 63 or this one was done ... A lot of times, getting a tester to go
[24:09.600 --> 24:11.600]  past 70 days is also a challenge.
[24:11.600 --> 24:12.960]  That's something that I've got to do.
[24:12.960 --> 24:15.360]  I've got to run those on my own sometimes.
[24:15.360 --> 24:18.120]  I get a lot of reports and then I just see.
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.120]  I watch the flavor reports, the growth statistics and characteristics.
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.760]  I watch for flowering times just like I do all those other feedbacks.
[24:26.760 --> 24:28.520]  Then I do a lot of averages.
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.480]  If a lot of people say this takes nine weeks, I will tell you that it takes nine to 10 weeks.
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.880]  I try to give you that extra week because, like I talked about earlier, people get eager
[24:37.880 --> 24:40.400]  and anxious and they cut shit down too early.
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.440]  If it takes nine weeks, I'll put 10 weeks on that package just sometimes to encourage
[24:44.480 --> 24:45.800]  you to go that extra week.
[24:45.800 --> 24:51.000]  Also, sometimes that extra week is where some of the stuff really bulks up and beefs up.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.600]  How accurate are my flowering times?
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.080]  In my opinion, in my experience, they are fairly accurate.
[24:57.080 --> 25:00.600]  I do offer a two-week range on most of the packages.
[25:00.600 --> 25:03.240]  Let's talk about something very important.
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.860]  These plants are being grown in different environments.
[25:05.860 --> 25:07.720]  They may be grown in a dry climate.
[25:07.720 --> 25:09.320]  They may be grown in a wet climate.
[25:09.320 --> 25:16.440]  They may get overwatered, underwatered, overfed, underfed, abused, loved, cherished, insulted.
[25:16.440 --> 25:18.600]  They could get a lot of different shit.
[25:18.600 --> 25:22.880]  Every one of those things I mentioned can alter the flowering time.
[25:22.880 --> 25:24.700]  Also, phenotype.
[25:24.700 --> 25:28.520]  Maybe you got the ... Let's talk about Sunkist because Sunkist is one that could really ... This
[25:28.520 --> 25:30.240]  could really happen.
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.440]  That tangy-leaning phenotype, that's done in 56, 55 days.
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.280]  If you get that more golden goat-leaning phenotype, that's a 65-dayer.
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.800]  You could have both of those from the same pack of seeds.
[25:42.800 --> 25:44.920]  It's just phenotype-dependent.
[25:44.920 --> 25:48.100]  A lot of people really like finding that golden goat-dominant phenotype.
[25:48.100 --> 25:49.840]  It's golden goat with oranges on it.
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.440]  A lot of people like finding that tangy phenotype because it's tangy with golden goat potency.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.280]  Then somebody's going to want the one right in the middle.
[25:56.280 --> 25:58.080]  It's all about finding the one that works for you.
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.040]  The point is the phenotypes are going to make a difference.
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.720]  A lot of people don't like the F1s because of the phenotype variation.
[26:05.720 --> 26:06.720]  I love it.
[26:06.720 --> 26:07.720]  A lot of people like that.
[26:07.720 --> 26:09.840]  You can find the plant that is for you.
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.480]  That is why I give you approximately a two-week window.
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.280]  There are always outliers.
[26:15.280 --> 26:16.280]  This is nature.
[26:16.280 --> 26:18.460]  This is science and nature coming together.
[26:18.460 --> 26:19.820]  There will always be outliers.
[26:19.820 --> 26:26.600]  If I say 55 to 65 days, there will be 50-day flowers and there will be 90-day flowers.
[26:26.600 --> 26:28.000]  That's just how genetics are going to work.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.440]  I'm giving you the best idea that I can.
[26:31.440 --> 26:33.040]  Always pay attention to the trichomes.
[26:33.040 --> 26:38.320]  Always go, in my opinion, if I told you 70 days, if I told you 65 days, in the first
[26:38.320 --> 26:40.360]  run always go to that last number.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.360]  That's what I encourage.
[26:41.360 --> 26:42.720]  I want you to see what it does.
[26:42.720 --> 26:43.720]  Let's watch it.
[26:43.720 --> 26:44.720]  Why are you going to cut it down too early?
[26:44.720 --> 26:45.720]  It might bulk up.
[26:45.720 --> 26:46.720]  It might get more potent.
[26:46.720 --> 26:47.720]  It might do some cool shit.
[26:47.720 --> 26:49.140]  It might get some cool colors.
[26:49.140 --> 26:51.260]  Always go to that last part.
[26:51.260 --> 26:54.120]  How accurate do I consider my flowering times to be?
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.680]  I like to think they're accurate because I do a lot of testing, a whole lot of testing.
[26:59.680 --> 27:00.920]  I'm making it very transparent.
[27:01.400 --> 27:04.600]  I'm having a lot of fun making the testing transparent because you guys can already see
[27:04.600 --> 27:08.240]  what's coming and it makes people super excited about it.
[27:08.240 --> 27:10.400]  It builds a little bit of hype and a little bit of mystery.
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.120]  I don't tell you what you've got when I send you testers, but I know.
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.720]  I've got a legend and I'm like, oh, our buddy Dave over here is testing product number five.
[27:18.720 --> 27:21.880]  Then I know that you've got Bubba Kush to arise and you don't know it.
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.600]  I'm just watching you grow and comparing yours to lemurs and lefties and fucking whoever
[27:26.600 --> 27:27.600]  else is growing, whatever.
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.760]  I'm just throwing out random names.
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.040]  Don't think I just told you what you've got.
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.080]  I made shit up just now, but I'm comparing notes and watching pictures and just getting
[27:34.080 --> 27:35.080]  excited for you.
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.960]  Then when everybody's close to finishing, I start telling you what it is.
[27:37.960 --> 27:40.920]  I'm like, everybody in this group has the same stuff and everybody in this group has
[27:40.920 --> 27:41.920]  the same.
[27:41.920 --> 27:42.920]  Then we reveal what it is.
[27:42.920 --> 27:43.920]  It's a lot of fun.
[27:43.920 --> 27:44.920]  I love the testing.
[27:44.920 --> 27:47.520]  That is how I determine what to write on the packages.
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.120]  I watch what the testers do.
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.600]  I use their feedback, kind of average that.
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.800]  I know by the male plant and the female plant what to expect in flowering time also.
[27:55.800 --> 27:57.720]  I have some anticipation there.
[27:57.720 --> 28:00.000]  I don't tell the testers how long to let it flower.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.520]  I tell them, let it go until it's done.
[28:02.520 --> 28:05.760]  Sometimes like I said, it's hard to let them go past 70 days for a tester.
[28:05.760 --> 28:07.640]  All right, so I've answered the first part.
[28:07.640 --> 28:09.800]  How accurate are my flowering times?
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.680]  Where do we go from there?
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.640]  My flowering times versus other breeders.
[28:15.640 --> 28:18.600]  I can't, I don't know.
[28:18.600 --> 28:22.200]  Honestly what the other breeders type on their packages, unless I'm buying that seed pack
[28:22.200 --> 28:24.720]  and running it, that's not my business.
[28:24.720 --> 28:25.720]  Literally not my business.
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.680]  I'm going to focus on what iReed Genetics does and we're not going to praise or bash
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.720]  any other company.
[28:30.720 --> 28:33.880]  Yeah, we'll just leave it at that.
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.840]  I don't know what other breeders, I don't know what they're doing.
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.720]  It's not my business quite literally.
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.920]  So then you're talking about would harvesting Sunkist on day 60 be approaching over ripeness?
[28:43.920 --> 28:49.560]  All right, this is where I'm going to say this is going to be plant specific.
[28:49.560 --> 28:50.560]  I don't know your grow.
[28:50.560 --> 28:51.560]  I don't know what you're doing.
[28:51.560 --> 28:56.960]  I don't know how hot, cold, dry, wet, humid, overfed, underfed, abused, loved, kissed,
[28:56.960 --> 29:02.560]  lollipopped, defoliated, overheated, stressed, dark interrupted.
[29:02.560 --> 29:04.080]  I don't know what you've got going on in there.
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.960]  So I really would say watch every single plant.
[29:08.960 --> 29:13.160]  You can't just, so if you've got a pack of Sunkist and a pack of Strawberry Starburst,
[29:13.160 --> 29:17.080]  you can't just say the strawberries are done at one day and the Sunkist are done at another.
[29:17.080 --> 29:20.960]  You've got to watch every single plant in there and pay attention to each one.
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.720]  I know that is probably not the answer you want, but that is the way it's got to be done
[29:25.840 --> 29:27.120]  if you want perfection.
[29:27.120 --> 29:34.080]  Now, in a commercial grow environment, I would take all these to 65 days, probably about
[29:34.080 --> 29:39.560]  60, 65 days, and then just chop them because in a commercial environment, most of the time
[29:39.560 --> 29:47.120]  we go nine weeks, 63 days, unless the owners are really cool, then you go 70 days to 10
[29:47.120 --> 29:48.120]  weeks.
[29:48.120 --> 29:50.880]  But in a commercial grow, these would probably all come down at the end of week nine, to
[29:50.880 --> 29:52.240]  be honest with you.
[29:52.240 --> 29:58.440]  What I would do, I would find, if you want to run these together, this is the inaugural
[29:58.440 --> 29:59.440]  run.
[29:59.440 --> 30:00.440]  This is your first date.
[30:00.440 --> 30:03.720]  I would find two that work well together.
[30:03.720 --> 30:05.360]  Something just went wrong with that fucking camera.
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.840]  We're going to have to finish the whole episode on this one.
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.840]  We're going to wrap it up quick.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.840]  That camera just took a shit.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.840]  Fuck you, camera one.
[30:09.840 --> 30:11.240]  I hope I got this.
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.840]  So let's keep going.
[30:12.840 --> 30:17.800]  I would find phenotypes that work well together and grow them together or find phenotypes
[30:17.800 --> 30:21.000]  that are completely opposite, that complement each other and run them.
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.280]  You can grow them at the same time.
[30:22.280 --> 30:23.280]  That's not a problem.
[30:23.280 --> 30:26.160]  You're just going to have to time it when it comes time to flushing, which will be cool
[30:26.160 --> 30:29.560]  because that will save you on the headache of trimming.
[30:29.560 --> 30:33.720]  If you've got the Raphael that comes down closer to day 70 and the Sunkist that comes
[30:33.720 --> 30:36.200]  down closer to day 50, that's hypothetical.
[30:36.200 --> 30:38.920]  That gives you nearly three weeks of dry, cure, and trim time.
[30:38.920 --> 30:44.600]  You could almost get one down, dry it, trim it, get it in the jars to get cured, then
[30:44.600 --> 30:48.500]  get it into wherever it goes for storage before you even cut down the other batch.
[30:48.500 --> 30:54.220]  You could have a nice perpetual harvest without having one harvest at one time and a perpetual
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.220]  grow.
[30:55.220 --> 30:56.220]  All right.
[30:56.220 --> 30:59.020]  This podcast got shorter than I intended it for it to be because I don't know what happened
[30:59.020 --> 31:00.020]  to that camera.
[31:00.020 --> 31:01.020]  Honestly, you guys, it's plugged in.
[31:01.020 --> 31:02.020]  Everything should be rocking.
[31:02.020 --> 31:03.020]  It flashed some shit on the screen.
[31:03.020 --> 31:04.020]  It went out.
[31:04.020 --> 31:05.020]  No excuses.
[31:05.020 --> 31:06.020]  We're going to make this work.
[31:06.020 --> 31:07.380]  Thank you for watching.
[31:07.380 --> 31:11.180]  The next episode will be better because this one was a fucking train wreck.
[31:11.180 --> 31:13.180]  Big shout out to my buddy Dave.
[31:13.180 --> 31:14.180]  Where are we?
[31:14.180 --> 31:16.700]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, please send me an email.
[31:16.900 --> 31:19.700]  Email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:19.700 --> 31:21.700]  Everything else is on the website, ieregenetics.com.
[31:21.700 --> 31:26.820]  I'm going to wrap it up because I don't want to ramble if this isn't even recording.
[31:26.820 --> 31:27.900]  You guys, thank you for watching.
[31:27.900 --> 31:29.460]  I love you every day.
[31:29.460 --> 31:32.180]  Big shout out to my buddy Billy Bong Smokin'.
[31:32.180 --> 31:35.460]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
