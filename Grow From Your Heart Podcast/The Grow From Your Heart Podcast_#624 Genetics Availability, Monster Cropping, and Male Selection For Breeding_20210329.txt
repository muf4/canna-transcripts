[00:00.000 --> 00:08.580]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this
[00:08.580 --> 00:14.060]  is episode 624 of the grow from your heart podcast. In this episode, I'm going to answer
[00:14.060 --> 00:18.360]  a couple of Patreon questions. Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few
[00:18.360 --> 00:23.480]  members of the 710 club. Of course, the 710 club are the folks who support us on Patreon

[00:51.440 --> 00:56.120]  the big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to my good friend North North
[00:56.280 --> 01:02.560]  turps. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.080]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so all
[01:06.080 --> 01:12.880]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.400]  you need will be right there on the screen. And of course I did include a link in the
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.440]  show notes and the video description to make it super easy for all of my friends. I want
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.480]  to start off the show by saying thank you for all of the birthday love and support the
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.680]  last episode was the birthday episode of the show. The show is now seven years old.
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.840]  I got a lot of feedback a lot of great responses a lot of birthday shout outs a lot of YouTube
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.560]  comments. Thank you for all of the support. Then I want to follow that up with a big thank
[01:38.560 --> 01:44.320]  you for all of the love and support and contributions from my friend Stoney scholar. A couple of
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.680]  episodes ago I talked about losing our friend Stoney to a drunk driver. I was pissed off
[01:48.680 --> 01:52.480]  I was angry I was upset I've moved on quite a bit from there we're recovering we're all
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.160]  getting back to the normal routines of life. But I owe you guys a big thank you for all
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.160]  the virtual hugs the digital hugs the virtual love and support the words of encouragement
[02:01.160 --> 02:05.600]  that stuff does help a lot. Thank you also thank you to everybody who reached out for
[02:05.600 --> 02:10.460]  contributions for Stoney's wife. We've raised a little bit of funding for her. I did try
[02:10.460 --> 02:15.600]  to include the link in the audio in the YouTube video description but they took down the video
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.080]  because of the description I had to repost that. Apparently you can't post GoFundMe and
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.160]  fundraising links and video descriptions anymore on YouTube. That's a no no. So I couldn't
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.240]  do that but I will find other avenues of posting those GoFundMes. Check on my cannabis my Instagram
[02:29.240 --> 02:32.720]  things like that you'll find a link to help out our friend Stoney. But once again thank
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.040]  you to everybody who reached out to me if you've contributed financially if you contributed
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.560]  with just words of kindness. Thank you that stuff does mean a lot it does go a long way.
[02:42.560 --> 02:46.840]  So thank you for all of that we're recovering we're doing well. You guys this community
[02:46.840 --> 02:52.160]  means a lot to me the iRi Army the Grow From Your Heart podcast crew just this weed community
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.920]  that we have created the DGC the Dude Grows crew whatever you want to call it the 420
[02:56.920 --> 03:02.000]  gang the 710 crew the cannabis community is fucking beautiful. It's impressive. I love
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.360]  you guys. I wouldn't be able to live the way I do. I wouldn't be who I am without this
[03:06.360 --> 03:12.640]  community that we have built. It feels great to be noticed in that community to be. I'm
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.280]  not trying to put myself as a leader in the community or whatever I'm saying now but to
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.040]  be noticed to be a noted figure in the cannabis community feels good to have to have this
[03:21.040 --> 03:26.320]  army behind me this team of support this bunch of friends. It is awesome. You guys are beautiful.
[03:26.320 --> 03:30.560]  You're amazing. So thank you. Big salute to the entire cannabis community. You've always
[03:30.560 --> 03:34.560]  we've always got each other's backs. There's a there's bad apples in every group but most
[03:34.560 --> 03:37.920]  of the time this community has got each other's back and it's fucking awesome. So shout out
[03:37.920 --> 03:41.920]  to each and every one of you. Then I want to send a special shout out to my good friend
[03:41.920 --> 03:46.880]  tree star meadow tree star knows why I'm sending them a shout out. Thank you. Big respect
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.440]  big support. Now let's move on to the main topics of today's podcast that music ended
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.080]  at just the right time. That was beautiful. I want to jump into some Patreon messages.
[03:56.080 --> 04:00.120]  Of course you can support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[04:00.120 --> 04:06.020]  heart. This one came from my friend caribou heart genetics. I like that a lot. It says
[04:06.020 --> 04:09.400]  and I'm curious the caribou heart you have the heart of a caribou or you eating caribou
[04:09.400 --> 04:13.960]  heart either way. I'm high and rambly this message says hey Ross to Jeff. I hope all
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.240]  is well with you. Things are great. My friend. Thank you says I just have a quick genetics
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.440]  availability question for you. It seems like every time I check seeds here now for your
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.800]  strains they are sold out or at least a couple of the strains I am looking for are sold out.
[04:27.800 --> 04:32.040]  I've thought of ordering them a pack at a time as they're available, but I'm up in Canada
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.800]  and I'm trying to avoid those extra charges for shipping over the border multiple times.
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.800]  Yes, that will add up quite quickly and just know just a disclaimer those shipping charges.
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.360]  That's not me. That's not seeds here now doing that. That is the Postal Service that charges
[04:46.360 --> 04:51.080]  you so much to get packages to Canada. It just costs a lot to ship over the border.
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.200]  No matter what you send it costs a lot of money to ship it. So we do apologize for that.
[04:55.200 --> 04:58.680]  There's nothing we can do about that shipping and I understand your dilemma of not wanting
[04:58.680 --> 05:03.200]  to ship a bunch of times over there. It's probably about 30 bucks, maybe 36 bucks just
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.520]  to send a pack of seeds to Canada. So I get it that adds up quite quickly. That's half
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.560]  of a pack of seeds at that rate or one pack if you're getting the under 25 packs. Anyway,
[05:12.560 --> 05:16.040]  let me keep going. It says I would much prefer doing one big order. Anyway, I'll get to the
[05:16.040 --> 05:21.200]  point now. I'm particularly looking for the morning dew lemon Jeffrey Golden Goat and
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.400]  orangegasm strains. Are they going to be restocked and in which case I'll be patient until they're
[05:25.400 --> 05:30.200]  back or are any of them going to be discontinued? Therefore, I should start searching through
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.320]  other vendors. All right, there are a lot of great things to talk about really quickly
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.360]  here. None of those strains the morning do lemon Jeffrey Golden Goat and orangegasm are
[05:39.360 --> 05:46.120]  going to be discontinued forever. However, the Golden Goat is sold out for a moment.
[05:46.120 --> 05:50.920]  Lemon Jeffrey is getting low and Golden Goat is not far behind in that trend. I will make
[05:50.920 --> 05:55.400]  more of those. They are in the next production run, but I don't know that I'll get to make
[05:55.400 --> 05:59.680]  more before I run completely out of those. So you'll have to be patient with me there
[05:59.680 --> 06:05.520]  or try to get them quite quickly. The others, the morning do the morning do will be around
[06:05.520 --> 06:08.480]  for a while. That's kind of a staple. Excuse me for the throat clearing there. That one
[06:08.480 --> 06:13.880]  will stick around for quite a while. Now let's touch on this Canadian shipping thing. When
[06:13.880 --> 06:17.840]  the seed vendors order seeds, they get them in a bulk order. They put them up on the websites
[06:17.840 --> 06:22.520]  and they sell out quite quickly. I can't control how quickly they sell. Honestly, I love that
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.840]  they sell quickly. That's what we want is vendors as seed sellers. We want our seeds
[06:26.840 --> 06:32.040]  to sell. So I honestly send them, they request them. I send them, they put them on the website
[06:32.040 --> 06:36.560]  and then they sell. Usually within a day or two of going up on the websites, they go out
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.480]  quite quickly. The things you can do, you can sign up for those websites mailing lists
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.020]  and when they put new things in stock, they will let you know, Hey, these products are
[06:45.020 --> 06:49.860]  back in stock. Or you can email the vendor directly and say, Hey, I see that you've got
[06:49.860 --> 06:53.180]  this one and this one. I'm also waiting for this one. Can you build me an order? They
[06:53.260 --> 06:56.900]  may put together a preorder for you. That way when the third item comes in, you may
[06:56.900 --> 07:00.620]  be able to get that item. They may request you to pay for all three of them at this time.
[07:00.620 --> 07:04.020]  When the third one comes, you get the first one that shows up, then they'll ship it all
[07:04.020 --> 07:08.900]  at once. I cannot guarantee you that any of the vendors do that. Some may do that. You're
[07:08.900 --> 07:13.500]  going to have to contact them. Just get creative. Uh, they're all ran by people and most of
[07:13.500 --> 07:16.540]  them are ran. Most of the vendors I work with are really cool people. They'll work with
[07:16.540 --> 07:20.380]  you and do what you need done because we like to make sales. We want to accommodate our
[07:20.380 --> 07:27.060]  customers. So, um, those strains are going to be restocked. Um, right now there are probably
[07:27.060 --> 07:30.620]  restocked by the time I'm recording. By the time this comes out, there could be sold out
[07:30.620 --> 07:35.020]  again. They will get restocked. So one of the other things you can do is to get myself
[07:35.020 --> 07:39.740]  back on track. Uh, you can sign up for the mailing list for the specific vendors. They
[07:39.740 --> 07:43.340]  will tell you when they get the stuff. You could email the vendors and ask to arrange
[07:43.340 --> 07:48.340]  a bulk order, or you can sign up on my website. There is a newsletter site where I try not
[07:48.340 --> 07:51.940]  to bombard you with too many updates and messages, but about once or twice a month
[07:51.940 --> 07:56.820]  I will say, Hey, I just sent an update to seeds here now.com or I just sent a restock
[07:56.820 --> 08:00.540]  to El Fuego seeds. And then you guys can be the first to grab that. You'll get a hint
[08:00.540 --> 08:04.540]  if you're signed up on the newsletter, but they go very quickly. And sometimes I don't
[08:04.540 --> 08:09.620]  even know there's a two or three, three to five day, maybe window of when the seeds leave
[08:09.620 --> 08:14.020]  my possession to when they're received by the vendors. And then I don't know when they
[08:14.020 --> 08:17.420]  list them on the website. They don't email me and say, Hey, we put them up. I don't even
[08:17.420 --> 08:22.940]  get a notification sometimes. So be diligent, keep looking, sign up for all the notifications
[08:22.940 --> 08:27.620]  that you can, and then just click on that site. Click refresh quite often. That's what
[08:27.620 --> 08:31.580]  it's like trying to get things on the internet nowadays. I apologize for that, but I'm excited
[08:31.580 --> 08:34.940]  that they're selling that quickly. Let me make sure I'm covering all the details in
[08:34.940 --> 08:39.100]  this. Every time you check seeds are now they're sold out. Yes, they sell quite quickly. I
[08:39.100 --> 08:43.560]  understand the shipping dilemma in Canada. It is expensive. That is not a, I can't do
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.220]  anything about that. I apologize. And I'm glad they make it to you because sometimes
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.780]  the packages get taken, go into Canada. Nothing will be discontinued. However, some things
[08:51.780 --> 08:58.660]  will be temporarily sold out. So you might want to act now. And I'm discontinued. No.
[08:58.660 --> 09:02.160]  And other vendors, other vendors are always an option. Of course, seeds here now is the
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.020]  preferred preferred vendor, but there are other options. Check my website for a full
[09:07.020 --> 09:12.860]  list of vendors on the website. I do not have hype seed bank and elf Lego seeds listed,
[09:12.860 --> 09:17.020]  but I'm in talks with one or two others. So stay tuned. We'll get them on there very
[09:17.020 --> 09:22.060]  quickly. Now this is more of a grow related question. My friend, a caribou heart genetics.
[09:22.060 --> 09:26.600]  Thank you for the great message and thank you for the Patriot support. I'm also working
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.060]  on other avenues of getting seeds to Canada safely. We'll work on that in the future.
[09:31.060 --> 09:34.800]  I'll keep you updated. Stay tuned for a Canadian update. All right, we're going to move forward
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.220]  onto these Patriot questions because this could be a long episode. It says this one
[09:39.220 --> 09:43.540]  came from, do they want their name said? I don't know if they want their name said,
[09:43.540 --> 09:46.980]  so I'm going to keep them safe and skip it. It says, good morning, Ross to Jeff. I just
[09:46.980 --> 09:51.580]  wanted to tell you that I listen to most of the cannabis podcasts from news to growing
[09:51.580 --> 09:56.500]  and you do the best job at explaining things in terms in which we can understand. And I
[09:56.500 --> 10:01.880]  like how you mostly stick to cannabis. My friend, that is a great way to start an email
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.660]  to me. Thank you. I appreciate that. Um, I do the best job at explaining things. Thank
[10:07.660 --> 10:12.460]  you. Sometimes I feel like I reiterate things and say things too many ways too many times,
[10:12.460 --> 10:17.140]  but that's how people learn. Some people learn visually. Some people learn, uh, from repetition.
[10:17.140 --> 10:21.220]  Some people learn from hands-on experience. I got really bored in school because I felt
[10:21.220 --> 10:25.140]  like the teacher was droning on. So I try not to, I try to be creative in my teaching.
[10:25.140 --> 10:29.780]  I try to paint a good solid picture of what I'm painting. Uh, I try to think that maybe
[10:29.780 --> 10:33.340]  you have no idea what I'm talking about from the start of the lesson and I want you to
[10:33.340 --> 10:37.460]  be able to get it from what I say. I find I've got a responsibility in that. So thank
[10:38.260 --> 10:41.140]  you for noticing. That's what I'm getting to. Thank you. Uh, and you like how I mostly
[10:41.140 --> 10:46.060]  stick to cannabis. Uh, yeah, it's a cannabis show. I try. Uh, sometimes we do, uh, sometimes
[10:46.060 --> 10:49.740]  I fuck up and put some political stuff out and sometimes I talk about comedy and whatever
[10:49.740 --> 10:53.420]  a little bit too much. Uh, but thank you. I'm glad that you're listening and thank you
[10:53.420 --> 10:57.220]  for noticing. I try to stick to cannabis. My life has other aspects going on, which
[10:57.220 --> 11:02.020]  I do ramble about occasionally. Uh, during COVID it's all cannabis. It's all podcasting.
[11:02.020 --> 11:06.180]  It's all chilling. So, uh, it's been different. I'm high and rambly. So thanks for hanging
[11:06.180 --> 11:10.980]  out. The message goes on. It says, I started breeding in 2018. Welcome to the club. It
[11:10.980 --> 11:16.620]  says I rented a room in Denver and this crazy lady's basement. I was so crazy. We named
[11:16.620 --> 11:22.140]  our one of our first cultivars alien struggle bus. Uh, that's a good strain name, dude.
[11:22.140 --> 11:27.860]  I was sour alien to wild tie. It goes on to say, anyway, we have since moved a little
[11:27.860 --> 11:32.060]  closer to home in Michigan. While that was a long move. I'm glad you made that safely.
[11:32.060 --> 11:36.500]  It says I've been working with the F one alien struggle bus and on the 11th phenotype
[11:36.500 --> 11:43.220]  I found a keeper. So you've got ASB F one number 11. It says after listening to the
[11:43.220 --> 11:48.380]  episode today about sub, uh, keeping sub cool alive, I figured why not ask you if it would
[11:48.380 --> 11:53.860]  be cool if I created a cross with the alien struggle bus number 11 and if so, which of
[11:53.860 --> 11:59.140]  your available packs do you think would go best with the heritage of the alien struggle
[11:59.140 --> 12:05.540]  bus? And we'll recap that sour alien to the wild tie. Uh, it says the phenotype is more
[12:05.540 --> 12:10.440]  Indica dominant in structure for bud and plant type. It is my favorite plant. So it is hard
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.020]  for me to say what I think would make her better. I know how you feel about that. I've
[12:14.020 --> 12:17.580]  got some plants. I'm just like, you can't even fix that. Can't add anything to it to
[12:17.580 --> 12:21.260]  make it better. I, and then it says, I feel like I'm rambling, bro. Don't worry. They
[12:21.260 --> 12:27.820]  like it when we ramble. Then it says, thank you for your time. Have a great weekend. So
[12:27.820 --> 12:30.420]  the gist of this, you have a great weekend too, my friend, you'll probably be hearing
[12:30.420 --> 12:35.180]  this on a Monday. Uh, so have a great week and a great weekend and enjoy your garden.
[12:35.180 --> 12:39.700]  Let's talk about this. I like a good breeding question. So our friend has an alien struggle
[12:39.700 --> 12:45.220]  bus, uh, F one and they have selected a phenotype. Um, they've got a male, let's see a cross.
[12:45.220 --> 12:48.940]  Oh no, they've got a female. They've got the number 11 and they want to find a good male
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.580]  from my lineup to cross this plant with. And just to recap the alien struggle buses, that
[12:53.580 --> 12:59.460]  sour alien. So I see probably sour diesel alien OG to a wild tie, which is probably,
[12:59.460 --> 13:03.940]  uh, got some chocolate flavors and some funk going on to it. So you've got the alien struggle
[13:03.940 --> 13:07.820]  bus. It's more Indica dominant in structure and plant type. It's your favorite plant.
[13:07.820 --> 13:12.040]  So I can understand why you'd want to breed to it. Now you want a male plant to breed
[13:12.040 --> 13:18.820]  to from my lineup. Breeding selection is all about your goal. What do you want to get from
[13:18.820 --> 13:25.540]  this cross? Um, is your plant mildew resistant? Is it pathogen resistant? Is it pest resistant?
[13:25.540 --> 13:30.340]  Uh, does it handle, uh, temperature swings? Well, does it handle drought conditions? Well,
[13:30.340 --> 13:34.580]  does it handle over watering? Well, does it handle under light over light? Does it handle
[13:34.580 --> 13:38.420]  shade? Does it handle, uh, if the LEDs are too close and too bright, does it freak out
[13:38.420 --> 13:44.060]  from that? Can it take overfeed underfeed? Can it handle grower stresses? Uh, what is
[13:44.060 --> 13:48.320]  this plant lacking? I would find what it's lacking and then find a male plant that can
[13:48.320 --> 13:54.640]  improve upon that. So without seeing, this is like setting up two people on a blind date
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.600]  and not knowing one of the people. So it's kinda, I've got a very minimal description
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.320]  about this. One of my date partners, uh, it's short and squatty and kind of Indica. So that
[14:03.320 --> 14:07.240]  gives me a lot of room that would breed well, honestly, to everything in my lineup because
[14:07.240 --> 14:12.400]  it's quite opposite. Most of my lineup is a skinnier leaf sativa type drug varieties
[14:12.400 --> 14:16.640]  that have lots of turps and get you a nice head buzz. Yours is this Indica. So it's probably
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.840]  more of a mellow cerebral sort of a thing. A lot of my stuff is going to work well to
[14:20.840 --> 14:26.920]  that. It is all about your goal. The male contributes a lot. Uh, the male is going to
[14:26.920 --> 14:32.200]  contribute a lot. Like I said earlier to pest resistance, to mold and mildew resistance,
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.640]  to just stress resistance. A lot of that is going to come from your male plant. So what
[14:36.640 --> 14:40.040]  do you want that fee, that new offspring? What do you want it to do? What traits do
[14:40.040 --> 14:43.960]  you want to carry on? So I know you asked specifically what plants you would breed with
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.920]  from my lineup. Let's talk a little bit about, um, strains in my lineup and what I think
[14:48.920 --> 14:54.920]  they would do if you bred to this alien struggle bus. Now, if you want to add potency, um,
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.480]  I know that a rise is one of the most potent lines in my lineup. Uh, arise test really
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.700]  high. I've got a 35.84% THC a test and arise. If you could find a male like my Solomon that
[15:06.700 --> 15:11.560]  passes that THC a trade along, that would be a beautiful breeder. You would almost be
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.740]  making a, maybe a better arise. It would be a rise to a strong Indico, which may bring
[15:16.740 --> 15:21.520]  out some new shit. That would be really cool. So maybe in a rise to your Indica dominant
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.560]  cross that would increase potency and give it a really cool cannabinoid profile. Also,
[15:26.560 --> 15:30.880]  if you want more potency, maybe the double dose, something about that dosey dough to
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.160]  the arise made some serious potency. You put that on your Indica, it's going to make chocolatey
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.160]  short squatty, super potent plants. It'll be covered in frost is what I would predict
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.240]  the flavor palette will be off the charts. I think that would be amazing. Um, if you
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.200]  want to make more potency, maybe the blue raspberry truffle, that one is known for making
[15:50.200 --> 15:55.700]  a lot of potency. So that would be a good idea. Maybe get Leonardo and reverse the Leonardo.
[15:55.700 --> 15:59.800]  That would be beautiful as well for potency. Now let's talk about flavor. I breed a lot
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.280]  for flavor. I'm a concentrate kind of sewer. Uh, I like the flavors. I like the turps.
[16:04.280 --> 16:09.740]  Uh, if I were going to be breeding for a flavor, I would go for the blue raspberry truffle
[16:09.740 --> 16:15.020]  as the male and find one that has a really sweet stem rub. When you rub the stem in the,
[16:15.020 --> 16:20.260]  in the veg and in the flower phase, it should have a sweet, almost a, a cereal milk sort
[16:20.260 --> 16:24.300]  of a smell to it. Uh, that's the kind of aroma and flavor I'd look for for a male in the
[16:24.300 --> 16:28.340]  blue raspberry truffle. Then I would go for the strawberry starburst. That one will give
[16:28.340 --> 16:32.940]  you some great flavors as well. Maybe, uh, there's a, like a throw up and strawberry
[16:32.940 --> 16:37.060]  milk sort of flavor from the strawberry starburst. That would give you a really nice breeding
[16:37.060 --> 16:42.660]  male. A sun kiss would be beautiful. Find a sun kiss plant that smells like vomit and
[16:42.660 --> 16:48.260]  orange rinds. That would be a beautiful male dad flavors. Uh, orange chasm would be a beautiful
[16:48.260 --> 16:52.400]  breeder. If you can reverse the orange chasm, create some orange chasm pollen and put that
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.820]  on your male on your female plant, you would make grapefruit, sour, funky, orange, tremendous,
[16:58.820 --> 17:03.500]  crazy, crazy plants. So those are some flavor and potency recommendations. What if you want
[17:03.500 --> 17:08.860]  to add weight for good weight? I would recommend the arise. Of course arise puts out big fat,
[17:08.860 --> 17:13.860]  heavy weighted plants. Blue raspberry truffle is a banger. If you need to pay the bills,
[17:13.860 --> 17:18.420]  that's one to grow. That'll put out fat weights. So also I assume, and I'm pretty sure that
[17:18.420 --> 17:22.640]  if you got a good male with good structure, a good shape, you could really pack on the
[17:22.640 --> 17:27.820]  weight from a blue raspberry truffle. Strawberry starburst does the same thing. If you can
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.380]  get a good strawberry starburst male that grows with a nice stout structure, big fat
[17:32.380 --> 17:36.940]  male cola buds, that one's going to give you nice offspring with big fat giant harvest.
[17:36.940 --> 17:42.280]  So it looks like kind of with my little chart that I've made here, arise strawberry starburst
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.420]  and blue raspberry truffle would guaranteed be good breeding male selections. I'm going
[17:48.420 --> 17:53.620]  to keep going because I do have a couple more criteria that work well for male selection.
[17:53.620 --> 17:58.540]  If you want to contribute to the mold and pest resistance, two of the plants I would
[17:58.540 --> 18:03.420]  consider breeding with from my line would be the prana and the morning dew. Prana is
[18:03.420 --> 18:08.700]  very mold, mildew and pest resistant. Something about the turps and the aroma of that plant,
[18:08.700 --> 18:12.620]  it doesn't get mildew, it doesn't get powdery mold, it doesn't get boitritis and it doesn't
[18:12.620 --> 18:17.180]  get spider mites. There'll be mites in a lot of the room and the prana plants, the plants
[18:17.180 --> 18:21.820]  that the prana was bred from, the flow, for some reason just doesn't get spider mites.
[18:21.820 --> 18:28.000]  A lot of the subsequent offspring carry that trait, that weird, uh, musty, incensy, dirty
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.320]  foot turps, something about that. The spider mites just don't like that. So you could breed
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.320]  to the prana and that would definitely help out with your mold and pest resistance. Morning
[18:37.320 --> 18:43.180]  dew has proven in many climates, many conditions, many environments, many places that it is
[18:43.180 --> 18:49.320]  very mildew resistant. You can put the morning dew in a greenhouse, you can put it in Maine
[18:49.320 --> 18:53.480]  in the wetness in Maine and it will finish and it will not get powdery mildew. I've seen
[18:53.480 --> 18:57.560]  it finish in Maine. I've seen it finish outdoors in Colorado. I've seen it finished outdoors
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.720]  in Oregon. It seems to work well everywhere. So the, uh, the morning dew is a good one
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.080]  to help you, uh, increase mildew and mold and pest resistance. So if you want to plant,
[19:08.080 --> 19:12.440]  if you've got a plant that is prone to getting problems like bugs and mildew, breed it to
[19:12.440 --> 19:18.520]  either the prana or the morning dew and the offspring may, just maybe won't be as prone
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.880]  to the problems you're seeing in the original female plant. Now, something we all want to
[19:23.880 --> 19:28.840]  do is reduce flowering time. Do you want these plants to speed up a little bit more
[19:28.840 --> 19:35.040]  quickly in the next generation? That's when I would find an early finishing prana male.
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.200]  I know there's some male plants in the prana line that start spitting out pollen sacks
[19:39.200 --> 19:43.880]  really early. There are some that build up big fat male colas really early in flower.
[19:43.880 --> 19:47.480]  I've let some of them go for quite a while. When you've got as many seeds as I do, and
[19:47.480 --> 19:51.600]  you're looking for males like I do, you let shit flower for a long time. I've posted pictures
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.640]  of breeding male rooms with like 10 and 12 male plants in there and they're just all
[19:55.640 --> 20:00.080]  fully blowing pollen. That's for me to do my male phenotype selection. So I've seen
[20:00.080 --> 20:06.200]  prana males make big giant colas with lots of pollen early on, which tells me the offspring
[20:06.200 --> 20:10.440]  from those will flower quickly and finish quite quickly. So if you want to speed up
[20:10.440 --> 20:15.960]  your flowering time, prana may be the little girl that you want to work with. So let's
[20:15.960 --> 20:21.520]  recap a little bit. Um, honestly, I think the one that we selected just by my little
[20:21.520 --> 20:26.840]  flow chart here, unless you've got problems, unless you want to add to the pest resistance,
[20:26.840 --> 20:32.440]  unless you want to add, uh, reduce the flowering time, I think a rise strawberry starburst
[20:32.440 --> 20:36.600]  and blue raspberry truffle are going to be your three hitters. If you want that strawberry
[20:36.600 --> 20:41.080]  flavor, use the strawberry. Uh, then you can make strawberry struggle bus. And that sounds
[20:41.080 --> 20:45.000]  fucking good right there. Uh, if you want to make blueberry struggle bus, you do the
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.440]  blueberry. Uh, if you want to make, um, I don't know, what do you, what would you call
[20:49.440 --> 20:53.720]  it to arise? That'd be the, uh, the arise struggle bus. That'd be the space bus, right?
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.240]  Something like that. You can make that one to the arise. So those are three solid recommendations.
[20:58.240 --> 21:02.200]  If you want to fuck around and make some feminized seeds, uh, I would cross it to the orange
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.920]  chasm. Um, and if you need to fix something, if you've got problems again, that's when
[21:06.920 --> 21:11.720]  I would go to the morning, do or the prana. If you're focused straight up on potency,
[21:11.720 --> 21:16.800]  um, maybe double dose and arise. I know that's a lot of info, a lot of details. I hope you
[21:16.800 --> 21:22.160]  had your notebook out. Uh, cause I spilled a lot of beans on that one. Uh, patreon.com
[21:22.160 --> 21:24.920]  forward slash grow from your heart. Thank you for the support. I'm not sure if you want
[21:24.920 --> 21:30.520]  your name said, but shout out and I hope your breeding project goes well. Also, once you've
[21:30.520 --> 21:33.900]  done that, send me a couple of seeds, bro, and I'll grow them and then I'll breed them
[21:33.900 --> 21:37.520]  back to something of mine and then I'll send them back to you and then we'll just keep
[21:37.520 --> 21:40.840]  doing that. And then we'll just keep breeding all kinds of crazy shit out of it. Make a
[21:40.840 --> 21:46.560]  whole bunch of cool new stuff. All right, where do we go from here? I've got another
[21:47.320 --> 21:52.120]  question in front of me. Do they want their name said? I don't know if they want their
[21:52.120 --> 21:56.280]  name said. Uh, we talk about this person quite a bit on the show. This message goes like
[21:56.280 --> 22:02.240]  this greetings Rasta Jeff. Your arise genetics are amazing. Thank you. I do appreciate that.
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.880]  I put a lot of time into selecting my arise mail that arise mail has been a champion.
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.200]  So thank you for noticing the hard work into there. It says now that I have identified
[22:10.320 --> 22:16.800]  the lady, I will be taking several flowering clones to re veg and enjoy again. So our friend
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.760]  grew some plants. Uh, they got into flower. They identified that one of these plants is
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.520]  a female and it's a keeper. So they have cut some clones, uh, from the plant that is in
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.320]  flower. That's where the question comes in. Can you dispel my myth? Yes, that's what I'm
[22:30.320 --> 22:35.140]  here for. One of my favorite things to do is to dispel cannabis myths. Today's myth
[22:35.140 --> 22:40.780]  goes like this. The taking of flowering clones and super cropping reduces THC potency of
[22:40.780 --> 22:48.020]  the offspring each time it is performed. That is the proposed myth. Let's talk about that.
[22:48.020 --> 22:51.860]  So our friend here who goes by, I'm going to say Alabama man is who this is from just
[22:51.860 --> 22:57.820]  cause I keep seeing it here. Our friend Alabama man, Alabama man is asking if taking clones
[22:57.820 --> 23:02.900]  from flowering plants will reduce the THC and potency of the offspring each time it
[23:02.900 --> 23:13.100]  is performed. I am not a qualified scientist to give you a real solid scientific science
[23:13.100 --> 23:18.460]  book answer. Okay. Let me say that straight off the bat. What I'm about to give you is
[23:18.460 --> 23:26.620]  100% bro science. This is all from what I know from doing, I've done this, I've seen
[23:26.620 --> 23:31.300]  this, I've experienced this, but I don't wear a lab coat and I didn't take enough notes
[23:31.460 --> 23:37.260]  and I'm not a scientist. So take what I'm saying with a grain of salt and this is my
[23:37.260 --> 23:43.740]  experience. I don't see any problem with those super crop clones if they are taken early
[23:43.740 --> 23:50.540]  enough and if they are given enough time to recover and be in a complete vegetative stage
[23:50.540 --> 23:55.800]  before you put them back into the flowering stage, let them a re veg, let them get back
[23:55.800 --> 24:00.540]  into a complete vegetative stage. Let them grow out of that. All that weirdness, let
[24:00.540 --> 24:05.140]  them develop an apical dominant top. Then when you flower them again, you will notice
[24:05.140 --> 24:11.100]  zero difference. I don't believe that there will be any degredate degre. I don't believe
[24:11.100 --> 24:16.540]  there will be any loss in quality. How's that for a bailout? If the clones are taken properly,
[24:16.540 --> 24:21.380]  if the mother plant is healthy, if the clones clones are taken properly and kept healthy,
[24:21.380 --> 24:26.500]  I do not believe there will be any degradation or loss of quality. This is a lot like re
[24:26.500 --> 24:33.500]  vegging. This is a lot like cloning. This is kind of a hybrid combo of re veg cloning.
[24:33.500 --> 24:37.180]  This is what a lot of people would do if they don't have enough space to sex a plant. If
[24:37.180 --> 24:40.500]  they don't have enough space to run a bunch of plants and take a bunch of clones, you
[24:40.500 --> 24:44.460]  run your plants, you find that keeper female and you rip a couple of clones right before
[24:44.460 --> 24:50.660]  it's too late. Don't go too late because then you may see issues. My disclaimer, you've
[24:50.660 --> 24:54.900]  got to have a healthy mother plant, a healthy clone donor. It shouldn't be too far into
[24:54.900 --> 24:59.740]  flower and then you need to fully re veg these cuts before you start messing with
[24:59.740 --> 25:04.180]  them and putting them back into flower or then you will see problems. So if it's done
[25:04.180 --> 25:11.940]  correctly, proper care, proper moms, good clean technique and everything is done with
[25:11.940 --> 25:16.860]  a standard operating procedure that is proven to work. I do not see any problems with this.
[25:16.860 --> 25:21.420]  Get the clones, cut the clones, put them under 24 hours of light, get them rooted. By the
[25:21.420 --> 25:25.220]  time they're rooted within that like 14 day rooting period, they're already starting to
[25:25.220 --> 25:29.860]  revert to go back to the vegetative stage. Once you pop them, get them under a bigger
[25:29.860 --> 25:33.900]  light. Once those roots take off, they're eager to get back into a vegetative stage,
[25:33.900 --> 25:38.240]  start feeding them strong vegetation, vegetative nutrients. Get them under the proper blue
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.780]  spectrum lighting, get them under the proper light schedule and they will re veg quite
[25:42.780 --> 25:47.860]  quickly depending on your feed, the amount and size of light you're running. But yes,
[25:47.980 --> 25:53.380]  those plants will be happy copies of their moms and no, if it is done correctly, you
[25:53.380 --> 25:58.140]  are not losing any quality. You're not reducing THC potency of the offspring each time it
[25:58.140 --> 26:04.540]  is performed. You're basically doing a hybrid combo of re vegging and super cropping and
[26:04.540 --> 26:09.820]  I think if you do it carefully, it will work magically. All right, Alabama, Alabama man,
[26:09.820 --> 26:14.460]  get an easier name to say, but thank you for all the great content, all the great messages,
[26:14.460 --> 26:18.460]  all of the great Patreon interaction. We message back and forth quite a bit. I do check
[26:18.460 --> 26:23.460]  Patreon not often enough, but when I do check, there's always a message from my friend Alabama,
[26:23.460 --> 26:29.060]  Alabama man, and I do look forward to it. Oh, he did send an update. It says correction
[26:29.060 --> 26:33.620]  to the above flowering clones. Yeah, we got that. We covered that, bro. We got that right
[26:33.620 --> 26:38.660]  on the first time. All right. How long have we been going? We are, you know what, let's
[26:38.660 --> 26:43.220]  just do this next one because because why not? Right. Nobody's knocking on the door.
[26:43.220 --> 26:48.900]  He's ringing the doorbell. Let's go to this message right here. This one says Rasta Jeff.
[26:48.900 --> 26:53.740]  I wanted to tell you belated happy birthday and I love the rants you go on. I love me
[26:53.740 --> 26:59.780]  a good rant. Thank you. You were in the right place because I've been taking dabs lately
[26:59.780 --> 27:03.460]  and I've been smoking some good shit and I've been on some good rants. I'm glad you're enjoying.
[27:03.460 --> 27:07.540]  I'm glad you're participating. I'm glad you're hanging out. Speaking of rants, I don't know
[27:07.540 --> 27:13.020]  if you watch the Monday night Instagram live shows where all I do is rant for a solid hour.
[27:13.340 --> 27:18.020]  I go on Instagram live. My account is I re underscore genetics. I invite all of you that
[27:18.020 --> 27:21.900]  are watching now to find me on Instagram. Give me a follow. Watch the Monday night live
[27:21.900 --> 27:28.660]  show every Monday around 7 10 p.m. Mountain Time. I log in and I take a few dabs and I
[27:28.660 --> 27:33.700]  hang out with my friends and just chat about life, talk about growing. Sometimes I end
[27:33.700 --> 27:37.780]  up on some super good rants. So I invite you guys to come check it out. See what kind of
[27:37.780 --> 27:42.500]  rants I get started this week. My rants are inspired by the things you type in the comments.
[27:42.500 --> 27:47.660]  So come join me. Everybody check it out. Monday night around 7 10 p.m. on Instagram.
[27:47.660 --> 27:52.420]  I look forward to seeing you there. I try to save the videos, but sometimes Instagram
[27:52.420 --> 27:56.340]  doesn't give me the option to save. Sometimes it pops up and says, do you want to save this?
[27:56.340 --> 28:00.380]  I click yes. If it doesn't pop up, I can't do it and they disappear. So I apologize for
[28:00.380 --> 28:03.820]  that. They have taken down all of the other videos I had saved as well. Don't know what's
[28:03.820 --> 28:08.620]  up Instagrams, but however, join me for the Instagram live show Monday night, 7 10 p.m.
[28:08.620 --> 28:12.780]  Mountain time. We'll hang out and rant about some shit. Anyway, this message did come from
[28:12.780 --> 28:17.740]  our friend girls grow too. And it goes on to say, I also wanted to tell you totally
[28:17.740 --> 28:21.580]  not cannabis related, but you've inspired me and given me some encouragement through
[28:21.580 --> 28:27.960]  your work that I could finally pull the trigger on starting my own podcast. This is not cannabis
[28:27.960 --> 28:34.300]  related, but I love hearing that I have inspired and encouraged other people to start a podcast.
[28:34.300 --> 28:39.060]  There are never too many podcasts in the podcasting space. I love it. I did listen
[28:39.060 --> 28:42.420]  to your show briefly and it sounds good. You guys are getting a, you ladies are getting
[28:42.420 --> 28:46.420]  very comfortable on the microphone and you'll only continue to get more comfortable. The
[28:46.420 --> 28:51.060]  sound will only get better. I think it sounds great and you're doing a good job for, especially
[28:51.060 --> 28:57.560]  for how early into the show you are. It goes on to say, um, I wanted for years and I've
[28:57.560 --> 29:01.580]  wanted to do this for years now and somehow never felt quite good enough to do so. Your
[29:01.580 --> 29:06.340]  latest episode with your expression of gratitude was so fucking inspiring and hopeful. Thank
[29:06.340 --> 29:11.220]  you for still talking to the camera and hopes to help someone. Uh, you've helped so many
[29:11.220 --> 29:16.020]  people keep, keep it kicking. You know, your legacy will be around in the cannabis and
[29:16.020 --> 29:21.860]  the history of cannabis from girls grow too. This is a great message. I know it's not cannabis
[29:21.860 --> 29:26.340]  related, but just knowing that I'm inspiring somebody to start a new venture, to jump into
[29:26.340 --> 29:30.020]  a new project that they may be of intimidated by or that they didn't feel like they were
[29:30.020 --> 29:34.260]  going to do good enough. Uh, that feels good to hear that this little show, uh, we've been
[29:34.260 --> 29:39.340]  doing it for seven years. Uh, not only are we inspiring growers and smokers and breeders,
[29:39.340 --> 29:44.300]  but we're starting new fucking podcasts and I think that's awesome. I'm going to add a
[29:44.300 --> 29:48.980]  link to our friends new show in the video description. If you guys want to take a look,
[29:48.980 --> 29:53.500]  check that out. I encourage you give it a quick listen, send them some words of encouragement.
[29:53.500 --> 29:57.420]  If it is not the show for you, keep your mouth shut. Don't send any negative feedback. Don't
[29:57.420 --> 30:02.580]  send any bullshit. Don't send any criticism. Nobody needs that shit. You guys send some
[30:02.580 --> 30:06.060]  positivity, send some love, send some words of encouragement, lift them up, encourage
[30:06.060 --> 30:09.840]  them to do more episodes because it's a good show and it's going to be very therapeutic
[30:09.840 --> 30:15.020]  for your relationship. So I'm glad I was able to encourage you to do a podcast. Keep it
[30:15.020 --> 30:20.120]  going. If I can provide any podcast help for you, it sounds like you've got it under control,
[30:20.120 --> 30:24.620]  but if you want some tips or recommendations, uh, equipment, uh, production, whatever I
[30:24.620 --> 30:28.260]  could do to let me know, I'd be happy to help you out because you've given me a tremendous
[30:28.260 --> 30:32.220]  gift that I see. It's over there. I see it almost every single day. I've got a great
[30:32.220 --> 30:35.260]  gift from you. We never talked about that on the show. I didn't feel like that was appropriate
[30:35.260 --> 30:38.740]  too much. Uh, but thank you for the gift here on the show. Thank you. It means a lot to
[30:38.740 --> 30:43.300]  me. I know what that is and I do appreciate it and respect it, but if I can do anything,
[30:43.300 --> 30:47.340]  you let me know. I will post a link in the description so that people could check out
[30:47.340 --> 30:53.540]  your podcast, support fellow podcasters, support fellow cannabis cultivators. All right, ladies
