[00:02.240 --> 00:05.160]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.160 --> 00:08.360]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.360 --> 00:12.220]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.220 --> 00:15.420]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.420 --> 00:17.640]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.640 --> 00:22.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.300 --> 00:27.640]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.640]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:28.640 --> 00:30.480]  It's time for a Thursday Quickie.
[00:30.480 --> 00:31.480]  Let's get on with the show.
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.640]  I like to start these episodes by letting you know what I am smoking, and it's a sad,
[00:34.640 --> 00:35.640]  sad day.
[00:35.640 --> 00:41.480]  I just finished this container, the last container of the Skywalker OG Live Batter from Garden
[00:41.480 --> 00:42.880]  of Whedon.
[00:42.880 --> 00:47.440]  Quick moment of silence to this empty jar.
[00:47.440 --> 00:49.040]  It was a trusty jar.
[00:49.040 --> 00:53.680]  It was a worthy jar, and it served a great purpose.
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.120]  Now this jar is empty, and it will be retired to the graveyard of empty hash jars.
[00:59.120 --> 01:00.120]  After OG, I'll miss you.
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.840]  That was some good shit, you guys.
[01:01.840 --> 01:04.800]  I bet Elijah's got a small tear in his eye also hearing that it's gone.
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.600]  We used to dab the fuck out on that Skywalker.
[01:07.600 --> 01:09.960]  It lasted a little bit.
[01:09.960 --> 01:11.760]  There's a lot of it, and now it's gone.
[01:11.760 --> 01:12.760]  All right, guys.
[01:12.760 --> 01:14.120]  The Skywalker was delicious.
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.320]  It's obviously got me in a good mood.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.600]  I'm nice and high, having a great day.
[01:17.600 --> 01:19.480]  Before we get too far, I want to make a correction.
[01:19.480 --> 01:24.760]  In the last episode, if you listened to number 300, thank you, but I said that Art Bell and
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.240]  George Norrie and Coast to Coast may have been the OG podcast.
[01:28.360 --> 01:31.960]  I know that that wasn't a podcast, but it was what I thought may be the first type of
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.280]  show to have that platform, that long extended platform to break the basic AM radio kind
[01:37.280 --> 01:38.280]  of a mold.
[01:38.280 --> 01:42.320]  But then when I was listening to the podcast and editing, it came to me that there is somebody
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.280]  else that I should give sort of a shout out, some tribute to.
[01:46.280 --> 01:51.480]  It's ironic because he did kind of pave the way for podcasting, and he was never a podcaster.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.800]  He actually despises podcasters.
[01:53.800 --> 01:56.000]  I'm talking about Howard Stern.
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.680]  Howard Stern was a radio DJ that broke all of his own rules, who pushed the limits, who
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.640]  ended up with his own show, who ended up with his own TV show, who ended up with a movie
[02:04.640 --> 02:12.040]  after him, who is still on SiriusXM making tons of money basically doing podcasting.
[02:12.040 --> 02:15.880]  In a way, Howard Stern may be the OG podcaster.
[02:15.880 --> 02:22.320]  I think it's funny that Howard hates podcasting, but it makes sense to me because he's OG.
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.520]  He had to bust his ass and get on the radio and fight with radio politics and business
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.520]  politics.
[02:28.520 --> 02:30.960]  And if you know anything about the radio, and if you know anything about Howard Stern,
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.480]  you saw all the stuff he had to battle to become Howard Stern.
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.500]  I was able to go buy some toys and plug them in and just run my mouth into a microphone
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.840]  and post it to iTunes and hope to get listens.
[02:40.840 --> 02:41.920]  It's so much simpler now.
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.760]  So I understand why Howie despises podcasts, but he is kind of the OG podcaster because
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.160]  he set the standard.
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.520]  He broke the mold.
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.300]  He showed us that we could do different things.
[02:52.300 --> 02:55.420]  So shout out to Howard Stern, even though you despise podcasters.
[02:55.420 --> 02:57.280]  I think you're the OG of podcasting.
[02:57.280 --> 02:59.980]  You definitely changed radio and broadcasting.
[02:59.980 --> 03:01.380]  So we owe a shout out to him.
[03:01.380 --> 03:03.620]  I'm going to keep going or this is not going to be a quickie.
[03:03.620 --> 03:05.620]  Holy shit, I'm talkative today.
[03:05.620 --> 03:12.620]  This episode is going to be about adapting and adjusting as a cannabis farmer.
[03:12.620 --> 03:17.500]  Now being a cannabis teacher and educator, I come on my podcast and I try to teach you
[03:17.500 --> 03:20.740]  guys how to grow cannabis in the best way possible.
[03:20.740 --> 03:23.940]  I try to teach you guys how to take care of your garden the best way possible.
[03:23.940 --> 03:27.980]  Sometimes that's hard because there are no instructions.
[03:27.980 --> 03:31.200]  Everything I say is basically a suggestion.
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.820]  You can follow my suggestions and it should work.
[03:34.820 --> 03:38.680]  Nine out of ten times it will work, but I don't know your grow room.
[03:38.680 --> 03:40.420]  I don't know you.
[03:40.420 --> 03:42.660]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:42.660 --> 03:47.820]  If you ask me a question, the only info I have is those two paragraphs you sent me.
[03:47.820 --> 03:49.580]  You may have left some things out.
[03:49.580 --> 03:51.540]  There may be things you didn't even think about mentioning.
[03:51.540 --> 03:54.980]  There may be something that I can't see because I'm not in the grow room that you don't see
[03:54.980 --> 03:57.300]  because you don't know to look for it.
[03:57.300 --> 04:03.660]  So helping you guys out, everything that I say is kind of just going on the fly by what
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.660]  you're telling me.
[04:04.660 --> 04:12.140]  Now, you have to be able to adjust and adapt to not having real instructions, but to suggestions.
[04:12.140 --> 04:14.180]  I don't know what strain you're growing.
[04:14.180 --> 04:17.460]  Every strain is going to require different treatment.
[04:17.460 --> 04:22.700]  I do recommend specific pH ranges and feeding ranges, but I try to give a range because
[04:22.700 --> 04:26.660]  each strain is going to want something different.
[04:26.660 --> 04:29.500]  That strain may want something different in a different grow room.
[04:29.500 --> 04:34.540]  If you've got an LED light, you may have to grow differently than if you've got an HPS
[04:34.540 --> 04:37.700]  light or if you've got a ceramic metal halide light.
[04:37.700 --> 04:40.740]  Everything that we're reading in the books, everything that we're reading on the bottles,
[04:40.740 --> 04:46.900]  all of the instructions should be taken as suggestions when it comes to growing cannabis.
[04:46.900 --> 04:49.220]  It's kind of like being a doctor.
[04:49.220 --> 04:51.260]  Doctors are always practicing.
[04:51.260 --> 04:56.060]  We are practicing growing cannabis because each plant we see is like a new patient.
[04:56.060 --> 04:57.620]  Your body chemistry is different.
[04:57.620 --> 05:01.060]  The next guy's body chemistry is different.
[05:01.060 --> 05:05.180]  How many people do you know that can smoke way more or way less than you and get way
[05:05.180 --> 05:06.580]  fucked up or not?
[05:06.580 --> 05:08.660]  And you're like, what's going on?
[05:08.660 --> 05:09.900]  That's because our bodies are different.
[05:09.900 --> 05:11.740]  Our plants are just like that.
[05:11.740 --> 05:18.700]  You're going to have to adjust and adapt to each plant, to each environment, to each situation.
[05:18.700 --> 05:21.180]  Different strains are going to want different feeds.
[05:21.180 --> 05:29.060]  OG Kush and Sour Diesel and Super Silver Haze, they're going to want completely different
[05:29.060 --> 05:30.740]  feeds, environments.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.900]  They want to be treated completely differently.
[05:32.900 --> 05:34.860]  You're going to have to adapt.
[05:34.860 --> 05:38.400]  Now sometimes at different stages of your grow, your plants are going to want different
[05:38.400 --> 05:40.660]  amounts of water.
[05:40.660 --> 05:42.500]  You're going to have to adapt and adjust.
[05:42.500 --> 05:45.540]  Maybe you're used to giving this plant a gallon of water.
[05:45.540 --> 05:46.540]  Maybe you see something wrong.
[05:46.540 --> 05:49.300]  You're going to have to figure out, do I need to give it a gallon and a quarter or three
[05:49.300 --> 05:50.300]  gallons?
[05:50.300 --> 05:51.300]  Adjust and adapt.
[05:51.300 --> 05:55.740]  Don't get stuck into your routines and patterns because the bottle says, the instruction book
[05:55.740 --> 05:57.860]  says, they don't have your plants.
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.180]  They don't have your eyes.
[06:00.180 --> 06:04.580]  Take all of the instructions as suggestions when it comes to growing cannabis.
[06:04.580 --> 06:07.560]  I said each different strain is going to want different things.
[06:07.560 --> 06:13.200]  Each different phenotype of that strain is going to want different things possibly.
[06:13.200 --> 06:17.920]  A lot of times you'll find a phenotype that is, this is kind of a typical thing when you
[06:17.920 --> 06:18.960]  get seeds.
[06:18.960 --> 06:20.560]  One will be taller and skinnier.
[06:20.560 --> 06:22.880]  One will be shorter and more dense.
[06:22.880 --> 06:25.920]  That's kind of a phenotypical expression showing mommy and daddy.
[06:25.920 --> 06:30.420]  They're going to want different things and you're going to have to adjust and adapt.
[06:30.420 --> 06:34.020]  Now when I run a pheno hunt the first time, those plants all get the same thing for the
[06:34.020 --> 06:38.220]  sake of science so that I can see what I've got so that every plant gets treated the same.
[06:38.220 --> 06:44.300]  I have a dialed in basic feed regimen, a good light schedule and a good room so that all
[06:44.300 --> 06:48.340]  those plants get the good basic treatment that I know works.
[06:48.340 --> 06:51.860]  So I run all of those plants under the same conditions in the same environment and I can
[06:51.860 --> 06:55.660]  see what performs ideally in the ideal conditions.
[06:55.660 --> 07:00.220]  Then I can select the keepers, the two, possibly three keepers out of that.
[07:00.220 --> 07:03.980]  Usually out of a 10 pack I find one to three that I like to keep and run again.
[07:04.580 --> 07:05.700]  I've seen what they do.
[07:05.700 --> 07:06.700]  I know they're keepers.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.700]  I know I can use them.
[07:07.700 --> 07:08.700]  I know that they grow well.
[07:08.700 --> 07:10.020]  I've seen them grow once.
[07:10.020 --> 07:11.020]  I took plenty of notes.
[07:11.020 --> 07:12.660]  I paid attention to which one stretches.
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.820]  I paid attention to which one stays squat.
[07:14.820 --> 07:19.900]  Now I can adjust and adapt my next grow to grow those plants properly.
[07:19.900 --> 07:22.680]  So you can't always follow what it says on the bottle.
[07:22.680 --> 07:24.740]  You can't always follow what it says on the internet.
[07:24.740 --> 07:26.660]  You can't always follow what I say.
[07:26.660 --> 07:31.260]  Nine times out of 10 I'm going to steer you the right direction.
[07:31.740 --> 07:34.620]  You have to keep in mind that I'm human and I may make mistakes.
[07:34.620 --> 07:39.100]  You have to keep in mind the only information I've got to go by is what you have told me.
[07:39.100 --> 07:44.260]  And also whatever I give you, the advice I give you, you're going to have to adjust and
[07:44.260 --> 07:45.780]  adapt it to your garden.
[07:45.780 --> 07:47.460]  You're going to have to use your best judgment.
[07:47.460 --> 07:48.460]  You're going to have to use your eyes.
[07:48.460 --> 07:49.820]  You're going to have to use your nose.
[07:49.820 --> 07:52.180]  You're going to have to use your sense of touch.
[07:52.180 --> 07:54.740]  Hell maybe even use your sense of taste.
[07:54.740 --> 07:55.740]  Use all your senses.
[07:55.740 --> 07:56.740]  What do you got?
[07:56.740 --> 07:58.740]  You got eyes, ears, nose, mouth and touching.
[07:58.740 --> 07:59.820]  So use all your senses in there.
[07:59.820 --> 08:00.820]  Get in there and smell it.
[08:00.820 --> 08:01.820]  Look at it.
[08:01.820 --> 08:02.820]  Taste it.
[08:02.820 --> 08:03.820]  Touch it.
[08:03.820 --> 08:04.820]  Listen to it.
[08:04.820 --> 08:05.820]  I don't know if there's anything to listen to.
[08:05.820 --> 08:06.820]  If your plants are making noise, you're doing something wrong.
[08:06.820 --> 08:07.820]  Listen to the equipment.
[08:07.820 --> 08:10.660]  Either way, you guys, you know what I'm talking about.
[08:10.660 --> 08:11.660]  Adjust and adapt.
[08:11.660 --> 08:13.860]  Pay attention to what's going on.
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.860]  Maybe the book says, give it a gallon of water.
[08:15.860 --> 08:18.460]  You poured in a gallon of water and that plant went crazy.
[08:18.460 --> 08:20.480]  You're going to have to adjust and adapt.
[08:20.480 --> 08:21.480]  Think about it.
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.480]  Go pick up that pot.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.480]  Is it too heavy?
[08:23.480 --> 08:24.480]  Is it too light?
[08:24.480 --> 08:26.420]  Does the plant look like it's too dry or too wet?
[08:26.420 --> 08:28.000]  You're going to have to think about it.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.700]  You're going to have to adjust and you're going to have to adapt.
[08:30.700 --> 08:34.200]  Let's talk about things like, I talk about popping the sticks.
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.320]  We call it super cropping.
[08:35.320 --> 08:39.480]  When you grab a portion of the stem and you grab it another inch above that and you twist
[08:39.480 --> 08:42.420]  opposite directions and it makes this noise.
[08:42.420 --> 08:43.820]  Your sticks will make that noise.
[08:43.820 --> 08:44.820]  It's a good thing.
[08:44.820 --> 08:46.420]  As long as it doesn't tip over sideways.
[08:46.420 --> 08:47.960]  If you're twisting, it's perfect.
[08:47.960 --> 08:48.960]  Don't break it.
[08:48.960 --> 08:49.960]  Just twist it.
[08:49.960 --> 08:50.960]  You want it to pop.
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.800]  When you're working with, let's say, Blue Dream.
[08:54.800 --> 08:56.520]  Blue Dream has tight node spacing.
[08:56.520 --> 08:59.040]  It grows really long, strong branches.
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.000]  Blue Dream, you can pop the shit out of it all over the place and it'll be just fine.
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.680]  Ghost Dog is kind of stretchy.
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.000]  She gets kind of tall.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.600]  You have to be careful where you crack her because if you do her too much, she'll start
[09:10.600 --> 09:12.800]  getting kind of droopy and get mad at you.
[09:12.800 --> 09:15.160]  You've got to adjust and adapt.
[09:15.160 --> 09:17.160]  Same strains, Ghost Dog and Blue Dream.
[09:17.160 --> 09:19.400]  Blue Dream supports itself like a champ.
[09:19.400 --> 09:22.400]  Blue Dream, you don't need a lot of netting, a lot of stakes, a lot of trellising.
[09:22.400 --> 09:25.560]  It's a good idea because the buds are going to get big, but if you don't have them, the
[09:25.600 --> 09:27.000]  buds will hold themselves up.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.400]  That plant's robust.
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.080]  Ghost Dog, you better have three layers of trellising because they're going to start
[09:33.080 --> 09:34.600]  tipping over at week five.
[09:34.600 --> 09:36.160]  Those buds are going to get floppy.
[09:36.160 --> 09:37.440]  They just can't support themselves.
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.840]  You're going to have to adjust and adapt because you've got different strains.
[09:41.840 --> 09:44.960]  It's not always going to be science, you guys.
[09:44.960 --> 09:45.960]  Plants are nature.
[09:45.960 --> 09:47.680]  They've got a life of their own.
[09:47.680 --> 09:49.200]  Don't try to fight it.
[09:49.200 --> 09:51.240]  Don't get sucked into your routine.
[09:51.240 --> 09:52.960]  Get sucked into the plant's routine.
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.200]  Be in the rhythm with the plants.
[09:54.200 --> 09:57.320]  Just because you get to the grow at eight in the morning, doesn't mean those plants
[09:57.320 --> 09:58.440]  need water at eight in the morning.
[09:58.440 --> 10:00.880]  If they're not dry, let them wait until noon.
