[00:03.260 --> 00:18.710]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.710 --> 00:20.210]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:20.210 --> 00:26.890]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 678 of the Grow From Your
[00:26.890 --> 00:28.450]  Heart Podcast.
[00:28.450 --> 00:32.010]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of Patreon questions.
[00:32.010 --> 00:35.410]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the great
[00:35.410 --> 00:39.250]  folks who do support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.250 --> 00:42.890]  Let's kick it off with a shout-out to a brand new supporter, my new friend, Rutrow.
[00:42.890 --> 00:46.250]  Let's also send a thank you shout-out to another new supporter, B. Bala.
[00:46.250 --> 00:49.570]  Then let's send a big thank you shout-out to the Dad Haze in Verbal Medicine.
[00:49.570 --> 00:54.170]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Johnny Appleweed in Alabama Man.
[00:54.170 --> 00:58.410]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Canna Organic Illinois in Chiefly 420.
[00:58.410 --> 01:02.090]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to a fellow podcaster, my buddy
[01:02.090 --> 01:03.930]  Caribou Heart TV.
[01:03.930 --> 01:07.050]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to a very long-time supporter, my friend, Glenn
[01:07.050 --> 01:08.050]  Gironi.
[01:08.050 --> 01:11.770]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to another good friend, Frugal Rock.
[01:11.770 --> 01:16.250]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to a great tester and a good photographer, my buddy AllMixedUp.
[01:16.250 --> 01:20.090]  And then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out
[01:20.090 --> 01:22.370]  to my buddy Guido7.
[01:22.370 --> 01:27.130]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:27.130 --> 01:30.810]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:30.810 --> 01:37.050]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:37.050 --> 01:39.690]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:39.690 --> 01:43.810]  And you do know I include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:43.810 --> 01:47.950]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:47.950 --> 01:52.570]  This is the part of the podcast where I cordially invite you to join us on the Discord server.
[01:52.570 --> 01:53.570]  That's right.
[01:53.570 --> 01:57.790]  There's an iRegenetics Grow From Your Heart Podcast Discord server with approximately
[01:57.790 --> 01:59.770]  1,500 members.
[01:59.770 --> 02:03.650]  There are about 1,500 people hanging out on the Discord server.
[02:03.650 --> 02:09.770]  We do actions, we do waffles, we do giveaways, we do prizes, we do hangouts, we do live chats.
[02:09.770 --> 02:14.010]  There's a sports section, there's a yoga section, there's a section for just about anything
[02:14.010 --> 02:15.050]  you're interested in.
[02:15.050 --> 02:16.730]  And I would hate for you to miss the party.
[02:16.730 --> 02:20.790]  So once again, I do invite you to join the party on the Discord server.
[02:20.790 --> 02:24.170]  There is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:24.170 --> 02:28.050]  I do look forward to seeing you on the Discord server.
[02:28.050 --> 02:34.610]  Speaking of show notes and video descriptions and links, I did add a Canadian vendor to
[02:34.610 --> 02:35.610]  the website.
[02:35.610 --> 02:36.610]  That's right.
[02:36.610 --> 02:40.750]  On the website, iRegenetics.com, I added an official Canadian vendor.
[02:40.750 --> 02:45.330]  If you go to the website, iRegenetics.com, you can either click on the vendor tab or
[02:45.330 --> 02:49.830]  scroll down to the vendors and it will show you a Canadian flag.
[02:49.830 --> 02:53.470]  That is an official Canadian vendor of iRegenetics.
[02:53.470 --> 02:55.130]  That is official, that is legit.
[02:55.130 --> 02:57.830]  I do endorse and support that vendor.
[02:57.830 --> 02:59.690]  They are real, so make sure you shop with them.
[02:59.690 --> 03:02.390]  If you are in Canada, that will help you out.
[03:02.390 --> 03:04.370]  Big up to all my Canadian friends.
[03:04.370 --> 03:06.670]  Big up to my friend in Canada for helping me out.
[03:06.670 --> 03:08.010]  So make sure you check out the website.
[03:08.010 --> 03:14.290]  Once again, iRegenetics.com for the iRegenetics Canadian vendor.
[03:14.290 --> 03:15.770]  There's also a new vendor being added.
[03:15.770 --> 03:17.570]  It should be up there by the end of this week.
[03:17.570 --> 03:19.930]  Hopefully by the time this episode comes out.
[03:19.930 --> 03:21.890]  Make sure you check out the list of vendors.
[03:21.890 --> 03:23.790]  All of the vendors do have different inventory.
[03:23.790 --> 03:26.330]  Some of them sold out of some things earlier than others.
[03:26.330 --> 03:27.910]  Some still have some stuff in stock.
[03:27.910 --> 03:29.530]  Some just got fresh drops.
[03:29.530 --> 03:30.530]  Check it out.
[03:30.530 --> 03:35.770]  The best way to stay updated is to go to the website and join the newsletter at iRegenetics.com.
[03:35.770 --> 03:38.030]  There's a spot to type in your email address.
[03:38.030 --> 03:39.030]  Join the newsletter.
[03:39.030 --> 03:43.310]  I do my best to send out a newsletter approximately the first of every month.
[03:43.310 --> 03:44.550]  Sometimes it's a little bit after that.
[03:44.550 --> 03:46.870]  Gotta get caught up, get some updates, get some things going.
[03:46.870 --> 03:50.470]  I try to get it out around the first, the first Monday of every month.
[03:50.470 --> 03:55.670]  Let you know where there are new seed drops, new coupon codes, new merchandise, new deals,
[03:55.770 --> 03:56.770]  maybe new events happening.
[03:56.770 --> 03:58.170]  I try to keep you updated.
[03:58.170 --> 04:01.170]  Do join the newsletter on iRegenetics.com.
[04:01.170 --> 04:03.170]  All right, I'm getting quite rambly.
[04:03.170 --> 04:05.290]  Let's try to keep me focused today.
[04:05.290 --> 04:06.570]  Outdoor season is wrapping up.
[04:06.570 --> 04:11.730]  I've seen a lot of podcasts already discussing it, but keep an eye out for bud rot.
[04:11.730 --> 04:15.090]  A lot of people are experiencing bud rot here in Colorado.
[04:15.090 --> 04:18.870]  If you've got an outdoor crop and you've not already taken it down, it may be time to go
[04:18.870 --> 04:20.570]  into hurry up mode.
[04:20.570 --> 04:21.650]  Hurry up and get that shit done.
[04:21.650 --> 04:24.470]  I know we can't make the plants ripen any more quickly.
[04:24.470 --> 04:27.730]  Maybe you can feed it a few products, but we can't get it to go much more quickly.
[04:27.730 --> 04:29.670]  But pay attention for that bud rot.
[04:29.670 --> 04:33.610]  You would rather cut down a little bit early than not get to smoke it at all because it's
[04:33.610 --> 04:34.810]  got bud rot.
[04:34.810 --> 04:38.530]  If you do experience bud rot, don't try to just cut around it.
[04:38.530 --> 04:39.690]  Don't just cut it out.
[04:39.690 --> 04:40.830]  Just throw that shit away.
[04:40.830 --> 04:41.830]  Don't smoke it.
[04:41.830 --> 04:42.830]  Don't extract it.
[04:42.830 --> 04:43.830]  Don't wash it.
[04:43.830 --> 04:44.830]  Don't blast it.
[04:44.830 --> 04:45.830]  Have some pride.
[04:45.830 --> 04:46.830]  Have some class.
[04:46.830 --> 04:47.830]  Just toss it.
[04:47.830 --> 04:49.330]  Learn from your mistakes and do better next year.
[04:49.330 --> 04:50.330]  That shit's gross.
[04:50.330 --> 04:51.330]  Let's not get anybody sick.
[04:51.330 --> 04:55.950]  That's supposed to be medical marijuana, not get you sick marijuana.
[04:55.950 --> 04:58.070]  That's not the way to do it.
[04:58.070 --> 05:00.890]  Another thing, I'm not even going to edit that big stutter there.
[05:00.890 --> 05:02.610]  Another thing that I should talk about.
[05:02.610 --> 05:05.290]  Some of your plants may be done at the top and not at the bottom.
[05:05.290 --> 05:08.290]  A lot of your big buds may be getting ripened and finished up.
[05:08.290 --> 05:12.330]  So if you're afraid of those getting any sort of bud rot or mold here at the end, because
[05:12.330 --> 05:16.210]  at the end is when the plants are very susceptible to most issues, if you want to prevent a lot
[05:16.210 --> 05:21.290]  of that, you can take the tops of the plants, the bigger, more ripened parts of the plant.
[05:21.290 --> 05:25.690]  You can take those and leave the lower parts of the plants to ripen further.
[05:25.690 --> 05:27.530]  There are a few advantages of that.
[05:27.530 --> 05:31.310]  One of the main advantages is that you get your product indoors earlier.
[05:31.310 --> 05:32.970]  You don't get the option for bud rot.
[05:32.970 --> 05:34.890]  You don't get the option for thieves.
[05:34.890 --> 05:38.630]  You don't get the option to maybe have somebody else find your crop if it's in an illegal
[05:38.630 --> 05:40.610]  area or on somebody else's property.
[05:40.610 --> 05:41.610]  Don't do that.
[05:41.610 --> 05:42.610]  Be a good grower.
[05:42.610 --> 05:45.570]  But I know there are some people out there doing their thing old school style.
[05:45.570 --> 05:50.770]  But you can take those top buds off, get them in, get them cleaned up, start drying those,
[05:50.770 --> 05:52.490]  start getting them ready for the trim.
[05:52.490 --> 05:55.530]  Then you can trim those, move them out of the way and cut down the rest of the plant,
[05:55.530 --> 05:56.530]  move that in.
[05:56.530 --> 05:59.050]  That way you're not overwhelmed with one gigantic harvest.
[05:59.050 --> 06:03.250]  And you can let those bottom buds finish if that's how it works out on your plant.
[06:03.250 --> 06:05.450]  Most of the time they do finish from the top down.
[06:05.450 --> 06:07.650]  You get those bigger buds at the top.
[06:07.650 --> 06:09.010]  That'll let the bottoms ripen up.
[06:09.010 --> 06:10.890]  Also you're getting all that big bud out of the way at the top.
[06:10.890 --> 06:14.210]  You can get more sunlight down there, get more airflow to the bottom.
[06:14.210 --> 06:17.090]  Once again, prevent your mold, your mildew issues.
[06:17.090 --> 06:18.210]  All right.
[06:18.210 --> 06:21.530]  So what did you learn this year in your outdoor garden?
[06:21.530 --> 06:22.890]  Did you take notes?
[06:22.890 --> 06:26.370]  What are you going to do differently to have a better outcome this year?
[06:26.370 --> 06:30.130]  Maybe you crushed it this year, but what are we going to do better next year?
[06:30.130 --> 06:31.330]  There's something you can do better.
[06:31.330 --> 06:35.210]  No matter how good you did, no matter how fat your harvest was, no matter how turpy
[06:35.210 --> 06:39.410]  that shit was, no matter how successful you feel like you are, the best way to be a good
[06:39.410 --> 06:42.850]  grower is to figure out how you're going to improve upon that next year.
[06:42.850 --> 06:44.970]  Maybe your dry and cure method needs work.
[06:44.970 --> 06:46.150]  Maybe your trimming needs work.
[06:46.150 --> 06:47.170]  Maybe your timing needs work.
[06:47.170 --> 06:49.250]  I know what I'm going to do better next year.
[06:49.250 --> 06:52.530]  I will plan ahead better next year.
[06:52.530 --> 06:57.810]  I did not realize I would have outdoor space until kind of the last day to put plants outside.
[06:57.810 --> 06:59.490]  I was like, they're going into flower today.
[06:59.490 --> 07:02.810]  Technically, if we think about other people's plants and look at theirs, we need to get
[07:02.810 --> 07:03.810]  them out.
[07:03.810 --> 07:04.810]  So I need to plan ahead.
[07:04.810 --> 07:07.370]  I'll make larger plants to go outside.
[07:07.370 --> 07:09.810]  But of course I couldn't do that because I didn't have the time.
[07:09.810 --> 07:11.450]  I will make better selections.
[07:11.450 --> 07:16.550]  I did good at selecting plants for outdoors, but I learned that a couple of things take
[07:16.630 --> 07:18.710]  way too long to even go into flower.
[07:18.710 --> 07:20.910]  So I've got one plant in a greenhouse.
[07:20.910 --> 07:22.030]  Most of them have been harvested.
[07:22.030 --> 07:24.150]  By the time you hear this, they've been chopped down.
[07:24.150 --> 07:26.730]  There's one plant out there that is not finishing.
[07:26.730 --> 07:27.730]  It is still going.
[07:27.730 --> 07:29.550]  It did not make pistils.
[07:29.550 --> 07:34.270]  It didn't get very many seeds because it was very late to go into the flowering stage.
[07:34.270 --> 07:37.630]  It was very late to go into the state where it can take pollen.
[07:37.630 --> 07:40.050]  So that plant is still flowering.
[07:40.050 --> 07:41.530]  Everybody else is cut down.
[07:41.530 --> 07:42.590]  That bad bitch is still out there.
[07:42.590 --> 07:44.710]  I won't run that one outdoors ever again.
[07:44.710 --> 07:46.190]  I learned my lesson there.
[07:46.190 --> 07:49.430]  I noticed that a couple of them went into flower really early.
[07:49.430 --> 07:52.370]  They finished really early and they banged out a ton of seeds.
[07:52.370 --> 07:53.910]  Some of them didn't give me as many seeds.
[07:53.910 --> 07:58.230]  I learned a lot of lessons on plant selection for outdoors.
[07:58.230 --> 08:00.190]  That's very, very important.
[08:00.190 --> 08:04.430]  We saw some issues and some things and I saw which plants experienced issues and which
[08:04.430 --> 08:05.430]  plants didn't.
[08:05.430 --> 08:06.830]  So I learned a lot of stuff.
[08:06.830 --> 08:09.790]  I will prep and prepare for issues better.
[08:09.790 --> 08:12.710]  I didn't know what to expect in a new environment.
[08:12.710 --> 08:13.990]  Now I know what to expect.
[08:13.990 --> 08:15.270]  I'll be able to prepare for it.
[08:15.350 --> 08:18.710]  I'll be able to treat for things that are coming because I know what is coming.
[08:18.710 --> 08:20.790]  I know, now I know when to harvest.
[08:20.790 --> 08:25.830]  Also I did not have any idea when my seeds would be ready when we put the plants outside.
[08:25.830 --> 08:28.550]  I thought we would be going until Halloween.
[08:28.550 --> 08:30.830]  We did not even go until the middle of September.
[08:30.830 --> 08:32.190]  We were cutting down.
[08:32.190 --> 08:34.590]  The middle of September we started chopping.
[08:34.590 --> 08:35.710]  It's October 1st now.
[08:35.710 --> 08:36.710]  We're almost done.
[08:36.710 --> 08:39.910]  So yeah, they got done much earlier than I had anticipated.
[08:39.910 --> 08:42.210]  So I learned a lot within that aspect.
[08:42.210 --> 08:45.690]  Plant selection and timing is mainly what I learned outdoors.
[08:45.690 --> 08:48.330]  I had people growing, doing a lot of the work.
[08:48.330 --> 08:49.970]  There were other people doing a lot of the work.
[08:49.970 --> 08:51.390]  They learned a lot.
[08:51.390 --> 08:55.090]  Something that I should say is that I could probably train the crew a little bit better
[08:55.090 --> 08:56.170]  next year.
[08:56.170 --> 08:57.170]  You guys did a good job.
[08:57.170 --> 09:00.530]  If you're watching, listening, you did exactly what I said to do.
[09:00.530 --> 09:03.330]  There were things I probably could have explained better.
[09:03.330 --> 09:06.890]  Could have said when, how, where, and why with a little bit more detail so that next
[09:06.890 --> 09:08.530]  year you're kind of able to do it.
[09:08.530 --> 09:11.010]  But I could have trained the folks that were working.
[09:11.010 --> 09:12.210]  They weren't even working for me.
[09:12.210 --> 09:15.170]  They did the work and it was a good relationship.
[09:15.170 --> 09:16.170]  Shout out to the team.
[09:16.170 --> 09:17.370]  They did a really good job.
[09:17.370 --> 09:18.770]  I feel like I guided them well.
[09:18.770 --> 09:20.530]  But I could have done better.
[09:20.530 --> 09:22.850]  It's been a minute since I've been in a big commercial environment.
[09:22.850 --> 09:27.250]  I'm used to running big grows with a lot of people and COVID kind of slowed me down.
[09:27.250 --> 09:30.530]  And then I was working with friends and I didn't want to fucking go in there and act
[09:30.530 --> 09:33.090]  like I was in a commercial grow telling my friends what to do.
[09:33.090 --> 09:35.210]  So there's a dynamic for me to learn there.
[09:35.210 --> 09:36.210]  But I did a good job.
[09:36.210 --> 09:38.570]  We're all still friends and the harvest is down.
[09:38.570 --> 09:39.570]  That's really important.
[09:39.570 --> 09:40.570]  But I was working with friends.
[09:40.570 --> 09:43.490]  A lot of times the grow with friends will ruin fucking relationships.
[09:43.490 --> 09:46.410]  And I told my buddy going in, I was like, dude, I don't care about the plants and the
[09:46.410 --> 09:49.810]  money as much as when the end of this comes out, we still have to be fucking friends no
[09:49.810 --> 09:50.810]  matter how this goes.
[09:50.810 --> 09:51.810]  Like I'm going to give you money.
[09:51.810 --> 09:52.850]  You're going to give me space.
[09:52.850 --> 09:54.330]  I want to be your friend in the end of this.
[09:54.330 --> 09:56.250]  This can't fuck up our relationship here.
[09:56.250 --> 09:58.050]  So that went well.
[09:58.050 --> 10:02.390]  But I could probably work on training my crew a little bit better next year.
[10:02.390 --> 10:06.450]  They did a good job, but some of the things we could have done better if I thought about
[10:06.450 --> 10:07.450]  things a little bit better.
[10:07.450 --> 10:08.890]  Again, I was learning.
[10:08.890 --> 10:11.090]  This was my first inaugural outdoor grow.
[10:11.090 --> 10:12.090]  So I learned a lot.
[10:12.090 --> 10:14.130]  I hope you learned a lot.
[10:14.130 --> 10:17.370]  I am kind of in the process of processing the outdoor harvest.
[10:17.370 --> 10:18.490]  Now it's all seeded.
[10:18.490 --> 10:20.250]  A lot of people are excited for those seeds.
[10:20.250 --> 10:21.810]  Give me a minute, you guys.
[10:21.810 --> 10:22.810]  It's taking, it's a while.
[10:22.810 --> 10:23.810]  It's just me.
[10:23.810 --> 10:25.130]  And there's a lot of plants, a lot of seeds.
[10:25.130 --> 10:26.930]  This shit's got to dry up.
[10:26.930 --> 10:28.170]  We got to get the seeds out of it.
[10:28.170 --> 10:31.490]  Got to get the seeds sorted, counted, packaged.
[10:31.490 --> 10:34.450]  I may have to order more packaging because I look like I might be getting low.
[10:34.450 --> 10:36.290]  They're going more quickly than I expected.
[10:36.290 --> 10:37.690]  So thank you guys for buying seeds.
[10:37.690 --> 10:38.690]  But give me a minute.
[10:39.490 --> 10:40.490]  I'll get it going.
[10:40.490 --> 10:43.410]  You guys, my point is, I hope you, the first point, I hope you learned a lot outdoors and
[10:43.410 --> 10:47.650]  I hope you took notes and I hope you made notes on what you can improve next year.
[10:47.650 --> 10:51.730]  I shared with you what I learned and what I will try to improve next year.
[10:51.730 --> 10:55.250]  And then the next point is that those seeds will be ready very soon.
[10:55.250 --> 10:59.610]  I was trying to save, honestly, I was intending to save some of them and use most of them
[10:59.610 --> 11:00.610]  for the Indo Expo.
[11:00.610 --> 11:07.970]  But right now I honestly have no idea if the Indo Expo is happening, if it still exists.
[11:07.970 --> 11:11.090]  Full disclosure, since they won't even respond to me, I'll tell you the truth.
[11:11.090 --> 11:14.730]  Everything I know about the Indo Expo, the owner of the Indo Expo passed away.
[11:14.730 --> 11:17.330]  They said that they were going to have a meeting and figure out what would happen with the
[11:17.330 --> 11:19.010]  future of Indo.
[11:19.010 --> 11:23.410]  Every email I've sent to every email address that exists that I know of for Indo Expo,
[11:23.410 --> 11:27.370]  either the employees have replied and said, we don't work there anymore, they fired us.
[11:27.370 --> 11:32.290]  Anything that ends in Indo, at IndoExpo.com comes back undeliverable.
[11:32.290 --> 11:34.010]  That email address does not exist.
[11:34.010 --> 11:37.570]  So right now it does not look good for Indo Expo.
[11:37.570 --> 11:41.170]  That is not an official statement from anybody but Rasta Jeff of IRE Genetics.
[11:41.170 --> 11:42.170]  It does not look good.
[11:42.170 --> 11:44.250]  I don't have any faith in that even happening.
[11:44.250 --> 11:49.290]  So the seeds that I was making that were intended to go out there, they may come out a little
[11:49.290 --> 11:50.290]  bit early.
[11:50.290 --> 11:51.810]  They may come out sooner than anticipated.
[11:51.810 --> 11:54.430]  You guys may get to play with them before we expected.
[11:54.430 --> 11:57.210]  So that may work out to your benefit.
[11:57.210 --> 11:58.770]  Let's figure out what happens with Indo Expo.
[11:58.770 --> 12:00.410]  We may just let them out early just because.
[12:00.410 --> 12:01.890]  We'll call it the pre-release or something.
[12:01.890 --> 12:03.010]  All right, I'm rambling.
[12:03.010 --> 12:04.850]  I'm good and stoned.
[12:04.850 --> 12:06.770]  Yeah, let's keep myself back on track.
[12:06.770 --> 12:08.530]  I was trying to figure out where else to go.
[12:08.530 --> 12:11.530]  Right here on this sheet of notes is where else to go.
[12:11.530 --> 12:14.130]  I do have some great topics here in front of me.
[12:14.130 --> 12:18.170]  Previously I did say that there are two types of podcast listeners.
[12:18.170 --> 12:22.250]  There are the kind of people that find the podcast and if they jumped in at episode,
[12:22.250 --> 12:23.930]  what are we, 678?
[12:23.930 --> 12:26.910]  This is going to be the one where they start and they will only hear the episodes that
[12:26.910 --> 12:27.910]  come after this.
[12:27.910 --> 12:29.850]  They'll never hear the back catalog.
[12:29.850 --> 12:32.830]  Then I also said that there are people that discover the show and if they like a couple
[12:32.830 --> 12:37.870]  of episodes, they go back to number one and listen all the way up to the current episode.
[12:37.870 --> 12:42.870]  I want to send a big shout out to my buddy David John in Johannesburg, South Africa.
[12:42.870 --> 12:48.790]  David has listened to every single episode at least once, maybe two or three times.
[12:48.790 --> 12:49.790]  Big fan.
[12:49.790 --> 12:50.790]  He supports the show.
[12:50.790 --> 12:52.670]  So I wanted to send a special thank you.
[12:52.670 --> 12:57.270]  Since David did make sure to reach out and let me know that David listens to every episode.
[12:57.270 --> 12:58.270]  Thank you.
[12:58.270 --> 12:59.270]  I do appreciate that.
[12:59.270 --> 13:01.710]  It's cool to know that people in South Africa are listening to the podcast.
[13:01.710 --> 13:07.470]  I do get some emails from services like Backtracks and a couple other analytic services.
[13:07.470 --> 13:11.390]  The podcast does get a little bit of notice, but it's really cool to find out that we've
[13:11.390 --> 13:16.150]  got a strong audience that wants to reach out and communicate in South Africa.
[13:16.150 --> 13:18.590]  So big up to my South Africa friends.
[13:18.590 --> 13:21.170]  Big up to everybody listening all over the world.
[13:21.170 --> 13:22.170]  Big respect.
[13:22.170 --> 13:23.670]  I appreciate it.
[13:23.670 --> 13:25.810]  Worldwide cannabis legalization.
[13:25.810 --> 13:27.130]  That's the goal here.
[13:27.130 --> 13:32.290]  Teach everybody on the entire planet how to grow the best ganja they can everywhere.
[13:32.290 --> 13:35.810]  That way everywhere I go, if I go travel the whole world, there's good ganja waiting for
[13:35.810 --> 13:36.810]  me everywhere.
[13:36.810 --> 13:39.450]  I just got to say, Rasta Jeff is coming to this city.
[13:39.450 --> 13:40.450]  What you got?
[13:40.450 --> 13:43.810]  And then somebody will probably, some cops will come arrest me in some places.
[13:43.810 --> 13:47.450]  But in most countries, in most places, somebody will find me and have some good ganja.
[13:47.450 --> 13:49.010]  There's that ramble shit I was talking about.
[13:49.010 --> 13:50.490]  Let me get back on track here.
[13:50.490 --> 13:52.150]  I do have a good Patreon message.
[13:52.150 --> 13:54.130]  This one came from my friend.
[13:54.130 --> 13:55.290]  How do they want to be addressed?
[13:55.290 --> 14:02.010]  They want to be known as Colin, CEO and Cultivation Director of Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[14:02.010 --> 14:04.250]  The message goes a lot like this.
[14:04.250 --> 14:05.530]  First off, big up to my buddy Colin.
[14:05.530 --> 14:09.250]  We've had a few, we've been corresponding I think is the way to say it.
[14:09.250 --> 14:12.530]  Good dude, great message, good vibe, and I'm happy to help you out.
[14:12.530 --> 14:13.530]  So this goes like this.
[14:13.530 --> 14:15.570]  Rasta Jeff, what's up brother?
[14:15.570 --> 14:19.090]  Check us out on IG at Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[14:19.090 --> 14:20.650]  Yes, do check them out.
[14:20.650 --> 14:25.850]  It says, we are a Colorado based, we are Colorado based but headed to Virginia to open
[14:25.850 --> 14:28.610]  our first dispensaries as licensing opens.
[14:28.610 --> 14:30.130]  Big up to Virginia.
[14:30.130 --> 14:31.130]  Something I've noticed.
[14:31.130 --> 14:36.930]  I do an Instagram live show every Monday, Monday at 7.10 PM Mountain Time.
[14:36.930 --> 14:38.010]  That's the Mountain Time Zone.
[14:38.010 --> 14:39.330]  It's 7.10 my time.
[14:39.330 --> 14:41.130]  I throw out my iPad on the computer desk.
[14:41.130 --> 14:43.810]  I take a couple of dabs and hang out with the crew.
[14:43.810 --> 14:44.810]  We bullshit.
[14:44.810 --> 14:45.810]  We talk about growing.
[14:45.810 --> 14:47.350]  I invite you to join us on Instagram.
[14:47.350 --> 14:48.970]  You might not get a notification.
[14:48.970 --> 14:54.250]  So you've got to follow me and then at 7.10 my time, open up Instagram, look at the top
[14:54.250 --> 14:56.330]  and see if there's a red dot that shows I'm live.
[14:56.330 --> 14:59.050]  If not, go to my profile, look for me.
[14:59.050 --> 15:03.050]  Sometimes it's like 7.15 because Instagram doesn't let me log in and do the live show
[15:03.050 --> 15:04.050]  right away.
[15:04.050 --> 15:06.450]  It makes me fucking jump through hoops sometimes.
[15:06.450 --> 15:09.530]  What I'm doing here is I am inviting you to the Instagram live.
[15:09.530 --> 15:13.250]  But what I was going to say is there's a lot of people from Virginia in the live lately.
[15:13.250 --> 15:15.410]  I'm not complaining, but where'd you guys all come from?
[15:15.410 --> 15:16.410]  Big up.
[15:16.410 --> 15:17.570]  It's so cool to see you.
[15:17.570 --> 15:18.970]  Big up to all my new Virginia friends.
[15:18.970 --> 15:21.610]  There are so many people popping into the Instagram live.
[15:21.610 --> 15:22.610]  It's confusing.
[15:22.610 --> 15:25.450]  I don't know where you came from, but I'm glad that you are there.
[15:25.450 --> 15:27.770]  Big up to the new legalization.
[15:27.770 --> 15:29.490]  Let's get myself back on track.
[15:29.490 --> 15:31.350]  Big up to the Virginia crew.
[15:31.350 --> 15:35.650]  My friend is moving to Virginia, wants to open as the first dispensaries and licensing
[15:35.650 --> 15:36.650]  opens.
[15:36.650 --> 15:38.370]  That is such a way to get into the market.
[15:38.370 --> 15:39.770]  Just get there right as it starts.
[15:39.770 --> 15:41.970]  Be in there as everything is developing around you.
[15:41.970 --> 15:43.310]  Be in the ground floor.
[15:43.310 --> 15:45.210]  You will know everybody in the industry.
[15:45.210 --> 15:48.650]  You'll know who to deal with and who not to deal with.
[15:48.650 --> 15:52.570]  You can be involved in making regulations, making rules, setting standards.
[15:52.570 --> 15:54.890]  It's great to get in at the ground level.
[15:54.890 --> 15:59.970]  It goes on to say, we are back as a patron and we want to shout you out for all the help
[15:59.970 --> 16:02.770]  and professional support you give to the community.
[16:02.770 --> 16:03.770]  Bro, thank you.
[16:03.770 --> 16:05.330]  I do appreciate that.
[16:05.330 --> 16:07.570]  Thank you not only for the Patreon contribution.
[16:07.570 --> 16:08.570]  That means a lot to me.
[16:08.570 --> 16:12.250]  I do like the funding and the support that way, but the compliments and noticing that
[16:12.410 --> 16:14.810]  professional support for the community.
[16:14.810 --> 16:16.410]  That that's fucking tremendous.
[16:16.410 --> 16:18.530]  That means as much as the Patreon funding.
[16:18.530 --> 16:21.010]  However, do not stop the Patreon funding.
[16:21.010 --> 16:22.730]  I love both of those.
[16:22.730 --> 16:23.730]  It goes on.
[16:23.730 --> 16:27.090]  It says, I have a question for you and hopefully it will give you enough to talk about for
[16:27.090 --> 16:28.090]  the show.
[16:28.090 --> 16:31.610]  Dude, with the mood I'm in and whatever I smoked, I think just about anything would
[16:31.610 --> 16:33.050]  get me talking for the show.
[16:33.050 --> 16:34.050]  So I appreciate this.
[16:34.050 --> 16:39.770]  It says, what past issues of Colorado's legal cannabis program expanding would you like
[16:39.770 --> 16:42.090]  to see other states avoid?
[16:42.090 --> 16:46.090]  So it looks like our friend is moving to Virginia to get going and he'd like to find
[16:46.090 --> 16:51.650]  some advice on some pitfalls that he can avoid in the newly emerging, newly developing legal
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.930]  market in Virginia.
[16:52.930 --> 16:54.410]  That's a very good question.
[16:54.410 --> 16:57.650]  Since we set a good framework here, we've been doing it for years.
[16:57.650 --> 16:59.090]  We've got just a regular industry.
[16:59.090 --> 17:00.770]  Now it just seems like something that happens.
[17:00.770 --> 17:04.530]  It's not even a fancy industry or a fancy place to go anymore.
[17:04.530 --> 17:05.610]  We do have a good framework.
[17:05.610 --> 17:09.650]  So we have seen the good and bad and the things to avoid.
[17:09.650 --> 17:14.130]  So what other states should avoid?
[17:14.130 --> 17:19.250]  The first thing I wrote down, and it's very simple, in Colorado, I believe that we use
[17:19.250 --> 17:20.810]  too much packaging.
[17:20.810 --> 17:28.250]  I agree with having a safe product that is tamper-free and kind of child resistant, but
[17:28.250 --> 17:32.290]  child proofing comes from parenting and that happens at home.
[17:32.290 --> 17:34.050]  That's my opinion.
[17:34.050 --> 17:39.370]  We waste too much plastic and too much shit in the cannabis industry, in my opinion.
[17:40.090 --> 17:44.490]  In a lot of instances, if you buy an edible, if one is to buy an edible, it will come in
[17:44.490 --> 17:46.930]  a multi-layered cardboard package.
[17:46.930 --> 17:51.530]  One that you have to push two pieces down on one end and pull a tab on the other to
[17:51.530 --> 17:57.290]  pull one cardboard sleeve out of another cardboard sleeve to slide out another cardboard sleeve,
[17:57.290 --> 18:03.010]  which will contain a plastic, like a shell casing, which then will probably have a plastic
[18:03.010 --> 18:08.450]  film over it, which underneath that will then have your small, tiny chocolate product inside.
[18:09.370 --> 18:14.210]  It's a product, the packaging is bigger than an iPhone for a product that is smaller than
[18:14.210 --> 18:15.210]  a Kit Kat.
[18:15.210 --> 18:19.650]  And in my opinion, that's a lot of fucking plastic, a lot of paper, a lot of packaging
[18:19.650 --> 18:26.410]  to go into a landfill to give the idea of child proofing, child resistant.
[18:26.410 --> 18:29.690]  I said it a moment ago, child proofing is something that happens at home.
[18:29.690 --> 18:33.250]  The whiskey bottles, all it takes to open a whiskey bottle is a good turn.
[18:33.250 --> 18:35.250]  We don't have to do a bunch of crazy shit for that.
[18:35.250 --> 18:37.930]  The kids could definitely cause more harm with the whiskey bottle.
[18:38.890 --> 18:40.930]  I think we waste too much fucking packaging.
[18:40.930 --> 18:44.370]  That's one of the things I really think is a problem.
[18:44.370 --> 18:47.970]  Not a huge problem, but it's something, if you're developing the rules, you could skip
[18:47.970 --> 18:48.970]  that.
[18:48.970 --> 18:54.570]  Just don't make us put a gram of concentrates in a container, in a box, in a bag, in a box
[18:54.570 --> 18:59.610]  with a seal, with a fucking other lock box on top of it with a combination code.
[18:59.610 --> 19:00.810]  Don't make us do so many steps.
[19:00.810 --> 19:02.970]  That shit gets ridiculous and it's very wasteful.
[19:02.970 --> 19:05.850]  I throw away a lot of shit.
[19:06.690 --> 19:08.010]  Limits on purchases.
[19:08.010 --> 19:13.130]  I do believe that there are reasonable limits, but I think that some of the limits that Colorado
[19:13.130 --> 19:17.770]  and other places have been trying to enforce on us are a little bit ridiculous.
[19:17.770 --> 19:18.770]  We are adults.
[19:18.770 --> 19:20.890]  I said it a moment ago, I compared it to alcohol.
[19:20.890 --> 19:24.290]  We can buy all the whiskey we want, pour it down our head, and if we die, that's our own
[19:24.290 --> 19:25.290]  fault.
[19:25.290 --> 19:28.850]  Why can't I buy enough cannabis to smoke myself into a stupor?
[19:28.850 --> 19:30.410]  I can't kill myself with cannabis.
[19:30.410 --> 19:34.650]  I can smoke until I'm hungry and need a nap, and then I'm going to wake up and be like,
[19:34.650 --> 19:35.970]  damn, I smoked all my weed.
[19:35.970 --> 19:39.010]  That's about the biggest problem I've ever really caused, smoking too much weed.
[19:39.010 --> 19:42.690]  I eat everything in the refrigerator, everything in the cupboards, and I don't feel good because
[19:42.690 --> 19:47.530]  of that, but I've never had a mean hangover and been violent from ganja.
[19:47.530 --> 19:49.250]  The limits are kind of silly a little bit.
[19:49.250 --> 19:50.850]  I understand some limits.
[19:50.850 --> 19:52.890]  Sure, why not?
[19:52.890 --> 19:54.090]  Why shouldn't you be able to buy a pound?
[19:54.090 --> 19:56.930]  If you want to go to the dispensary and buy a pound, maybe get one.
[19:56.930 --> 20:01.810]  I understand that's for redistribution purposes, but if cannabis was legal everywhere and there
[20:01.810 --> 20:04.610]  was a dispensary everywhere, nobody would be redistributing.
[20:04.610 --> 20:09.210]  All right, so some of the limits I do think are a little bit silly, although I understand
[20:09.210 --> 20:12.570]  the reason, but other rules make those reasons.
[20:12.570 --> 20:14.690]  It's all a chain.
[20:14.690 --> 20:18.370]  Something I would really would like to have seen, and I think I'm doing this different.
[20:18.370 --> 20:21.010]  You said issues that we could have avoided.
[20:21.010 --> 20:24.570]  I'm kind of talking about things like just small details, but something that we skipped
[20:24.570 --> 20:28.650]  ourselves on is a safe place to consume our product.
[20:28.650 --> 20:31.450]  I can buy cannabis.
[20:32.090 --> 20:33.410]  I'm just kind of viewing my city as I cruise around.
[20:33.410 --> 20:36.210]  If I come from the interstate, I pass one, two.
[20:36.210 --> 20:39.450]  If I keep going that way, there's one, two.
[20:39.450 --> 20:41.370]  There's Apothecary Farms.
[20:41.370 --> 20:42.370]  There's two out back.
[20:42.370 --> 20:49.210]  I could probably drive to 10 or 12 dispensaries within seven or eight minutes probably, but
[20:49.210 --> 20:52.930]  there's nowhere around here to smoke any of the product that I buy.
[20:52.930 --> 20:55.090]  There are two really cool parks.
[20:55.090 --> 20:56.090]  There's a state park.
[20:56.090 --> 20:59.970]  There's a skate park, but it's illegal to smoke at those places.
[20:59.970 --> 21:05.010]  You cannot consume cannabis at the city park, at the state park, at the skate park.
[21:05.010 --> 21:06.010]  You can't smoke there.
[21:06.010 --> 21:07.170]  It would be really cool if we could.
[21:07.170 --> 21:08.170]  I'd really enjoy it.
[21:08.170 --> 21:12.970]  Not to say we don't, but you're not supposed to, and if you get caught there, it's like
[21:12.970 --> 21:13.970]  an actual crime.
[21:13.970 --> 21:15.410]  You actually can get in trouble for it.
[21:15.410 --> 21:18.450]  Within the city, most of the time, they'll say, hey, you can't fucking smoke here, dude,
[21:18.450 --> 21:22.170]  but at the city park, the skate park, shit like that, they will definitely be a little
[21:22.170 --> 21:23.290]  bit more of a dickhead.
[21:23.290 --> 21:25.610]  There's no safe place to consume products.
[21:25.610 --> 21:30.650]  I've got to come home or I've got to go somewhere else and kind of hide and smoke in the car,
[21:30.650 --> 21:36.010]  which if you're a tourist, that's not cool because what if you're new and you can't smoke
[21:36.010 --> 21:40.370]  like I can and you go buy some dabs and you go park somewhere and you hit a dab pin and
[21:40.370 --> 21:44.090]  now you're sitting in your car just fucking roasted and you don't know what to do, where
[21:44.090 --> 21:45.090]  to go.
[21:45.090 --> 21:47.290]  The only safe place is that car right now.
[21:47.290 --> 21:50.010]  If you're at the park, you can fucking roll around in the grass.
[21:50.010 --> 21:51.010]  You can go down the slide.
[21:51.010 --> 21:52.090]  You're at the park.
[21:52.090 --> 21:54.770]  It's way more safe than just being stuck in the car.
[21:54.930 --> 21:56.010]  There's no driving to be done.
[21:56.010 --> 21:59.050]  If you're at the park, you could drive the bench and you're safe.
[21:59.050 --> 22:00.930]  You could feed the ducks and you'll be cool.
[22:00.930 --> 22:05.290]  But I think a place to consume would be really cool.
[22:05.290 --> 22:06.290]  I'm at home.
[22:06.290 --> 22:07.290]  I can smoke freely here.
[22:07.290 --> 22:11.270]  But if there were a place where I could go socialize and consume cannabis with my friends
[22:11.270 --> 22:13.470]  freely and openly, I'd go there.
[22:13.470 --> 22:15.530]  We would do the podcast from there occasionally.
[22:15.530 --> 22:20.530]  We'd have groups of people there, like just do shows there, have iRegenetics parties there.
[22:20.530 --> 22:21.530]  It'd be cool.
[22:21.530 --> 22:23.090]  It'd be just way.
[22:23.090 --> 22:25.290]  We have all those kind of drinking establishments.
[22:25.290 --> 22:27.890]  Why can't we have cannabis consumption establishments?
[22:27.890 --> 22:33.430]  I know I keep comparing this to cannabis, but in Colorado, we did do the regulate cannabis
[22:33.430 --> 22:37.030]  like alcohol model and we're still not following that.
[22:37.030 --> 22:38.030]  We treat it way different.
[22:38.030 --> 22:42.290]  I said before, I can buy all the whiskey that I can fucking load into the car at the liquor
[22:42.290 --> 22:45.090]  store, but I can't buy all the cannabis.
[22:45.090 --> 22:47.330]  So there are some silly rules.
[22:47.330 --> 22:50.090]  The next thing I wrote down is delivery.
[22:50.090 --> 22:51.470]  It's 2021.
[22:51.470 --> 22:52.690]  Everything gets delivered now.
[22:53.290 --> 22:55.050]  My food comes to my front door.
[22:55.050 --> 22:56.610]  All my Amazon stuff comes.
[22:56.610 --> 22:58.010]  Everything I want just comes to the front door.
[22:58.010 --> 23:00.810]  I barely have to leave the house to go buy any products.
[23:00.810 --> 23:02.570]  I can get my groceries delivered.
[23:02.570 --> 23:06.410]  I can rely on all that stuff to show up except my cannabis.
[23:06.410 --> 23:09.830]  In California and a lot of other places, you can just call a service and they will deliver
[23:09.830 --> 23:11.210]  your product to you.
[23:11.210 --> 23:16.290]  I think that delivery would be a great option, especially for a lot of people that don't
[23:16.290 --> 23:17.570]  have transportation.
[23:17.570 --> 23:21.770]  Maybe some people can't get on the bus, can't get an Uber, can't get a cab to go buy their
[23:21.890 --> 23:22.890]  tonja.
[23:22.890 --> 23:25.170]  It would just help them out just to get that stuff delivered.
[23:25.170 --> 23:30.130]  A lot of times, I already basically know what I want from the dispensary that I frequent.
[23:30.130 --> 23:31.330]  I know which brand I want.
[23:31.330 --> 23:32.690]  I know what type of product I want.
[23:32.690 --> 23:36.650]  I basically just need to see what's on the list and see what's available in those parameters
[23:36.650 --> 23:39.690]  and pick the strain or the flavor or whatever you want to call it.
[23:39.690 --> 23:42.050]  I already know because I've been to that dispensary so many times.
[23:42.050 --> 23:43.450]  I know my favorite product.
[23:43.450 --> 23:45.410]  I can online shop the shit out of that.
[23:45.410 --> 23:46.530]  I'm allowed eight grams.
[23:46.530 --> 23:51.210]  I just click two of these, two of these, four of these, 20% tip, 30% whatever they give
[23:51.210 --> 23:52.210]  me the option for.
[23:52.210 --> 23:54.730]  There's probably checkmark boxes in the app that I built in my head.
[23:54.730 --> 23:57.330]  It looks just like Grubhub, but it's Dabhub or something.
[23:57.330 --> 23:59.770]  Dubhub, they just bring you some dubs.
[23:59.770 --> 24:02.370]  You just fucking click it up and they show up just like Grubhub.
[24:02.370 --> 24:03.370]  They knock on your door.
[24:03.370 --> 24:04.370]  They check your ID.
[24:04.370 --> 24:06.970]  Make sure the person that fucking paid for it is the one showing ID.
[24:06.970 --> 24:09.410]  They go, high five, Ross DeJeff, take a dab for me.
[24:09.410 --> 24:11.610]  You go, here's fucking 20 bucks for a tip.
[24:11.610 --> 24:12.610]  Thank you for being fast.
[24:12.610 --> 24:14.770]  Be careful out there, bro.
[24:14.770 --> 24:17.290]  Bring them in and give them a dab, but that sounds really creepy because after you give
[24:17.290 --> 24:18.970]  people a dab, they don't fucking leave.
[24:18.970 --> 24:22.170]  I think delivery would be super cool.
[24:22.170 --> 24:26.170]  Another thing that we are really lacking here in Colorado, and you're going to think I'm
[24:26.170 --> 24:30.810]  crazy when I say this because I act like we're the most progressive cannabis state, one of
[24:30.810 --> 24:32.250]  the most progressive cannabis states.
[24:32.250 --> 24:38.690]  We've got the rules and all that stuff, but we lack heavily in education.
[24:38.690 --> 24:41.450]  Education is lacking in the consumer.
[24:41.450 --> 24:44.290]  Education is lacking heavily in the industry.
[24:44.290 --> 24:48.970]  Education is lacking heavily in legislature and council and people that make the rules
[24:48.970 --> 24:50.450]  and regulations.
[24:50.450 --> 24:52.970]  There's a huge lack of education.
[24:52.970 --> 24:57.890]  I feel like a lot of the people that are in the role of making the rules and deciding
[24:57.890 --> 25:02.910]  the future of legal and recreational cannabis are not involved in cannabis in any way.
[25:02.910 --> 25:05.810]  They don't understand the growing, but they're making the rules of grows.
[25:05.810 --> 25:09.450]  They don't understand the distribution or consumption, but they're making the rules
[25:09.450 --> 25:13.510]  for how it's distributed and who can buy it, how it's sold, what increments, what kind
[25:13.510 --> 25:14.710]  of packaging.
[25:14.710 --> 25:19.390]  They don't know what they're doing, and they're fucking up the profitability, the viability,
[25:19.390 --> 25:23.150]  the longevity, the enjoyability of the entire industry.
[25:23.150 --> 25:26.910]  You actually asked for something to avoid, but I think this is something that you definitely
[25:26.910 --> 25:32.590]  should try to see if you can include or something as some sort of education or include people
[25:32.590 --> 25:35.910]  that you know are good growers, good speakers.
[25:35.910 --> 25:40.230]  It'd be ideal to find a guy like myself to go talk to city council with you or be involved
[25:40.230 --> 25:41.790]  with the rulemaking committee.
[25:41.790 --> 25:46.950]  Whatever the committee is called, whoever has developed your state, enter your state's
[25:46.950 --> 25:53.270]  name here, the Southern Colorado Cannabis Law Invention and Establishment Committee.
[25:53.270 --> 25:54.550]  Be part of that committee.
[25:54.550 --> 25:58.310]  Whatever state you're in, get a grower like myself to be on the grow committee.
[25:58.310 --> 26:01.310]  Get a spokesperson like Mike to be on the rule committee.
[26:01.310 --> 26:04.770]  When it comes to building a team, we've got to do our best to get people that understand
[26:04.770 --> 26:09.250]  our goal, and our goal is to get real quality products to the people that desire them.
[26:09.250 --> 26:13.570]  If they're medical consumers, if they're recreational consumers, our goal is to get
[26:13.570 --> 26:16.370]  a high quality product to those people.
[26:16.370 --> 26:21.090]  If you have somebody on our team helping make the rules, make the regulations, helping make
[26:21.090 --> 26:23.490]  the guidelines, it will really help us out.
[26:23.490 --> 26:28.330]  Get quality products, easily accessible to people that need them.
[26:28.330 --> 26:30.250]  I think education is very important.
[26:30.250 --> 26:35.770]  Try to educate people, and then try to put educated people in the correct positions.
[26:35.770 --> 26:38.710]  If not, you end up with shit like we got here.
[26:38.710 --> 26:44.190]  We had things like an ex-sheriff, and an old PTA teacher, and a retired city council person
[26:44.190 --> 26:45.670]  making rules on cannabis.
[26:45.670 --> 26:47.830]  Guess how many of those people smoke cannabis?
[26:47.830 --> 26:48.830]  None of them.
[26:48.830 --> 26:50.750]  Guess how many people thought cannabis was the fucking devil?
[26:50.750 --> 26:52.350]  All three of them.
[26:52.350 --> 26:55.750]  Why are those people making rules on something they don't understand?
[26:55.750 --> 26:58.910]  Get people that understand, that know what they're talking about in there.
[26:58.910 --> 27:02.790]  Mike did his best to help, but sometimes Mike wasn't officially city council.
[27:02.790 --> 27:04.470]  Mike was just a citizen speaking.
[27:04.470 --> 27:06.730]  A lot of times, they gave him the cold shoulder.
[27:06.730 --> 27:08.130]  They fucking ignored Mike.
[27:08.130 --> 27:11.650]  Big up to Mike for doing everything you did for Colorado cannabis, bro.
[27:11.650 --> 27:13.970]  People don't realize what you did, especially for Pueblo.
[27:13.970 --> 27:15.370]  I know what you were doing.
[27:15.370 --> 27:16.370]  I see it.
[27:16.370 --> 27:17.370]  I know what you tried to do.
[27:17.370 --> 27:18.370]  I saw the struggle.
[27:18.370 --> 27:19.370]  That struggle was real.
[27:19.370 --> 27:24.570]  All right, so get somebody like Mike and I on your team.
[27:24.570 --> 27:28.130]  I'm the white guy with dreadlocks, so I kind of stayed back and just spoke.
[27:28.130 --> 27:32.370]  I told Mike speaking points, and Mike would come to me and say, hey, what do you think
[27:32.370 --> 27:33.770]  about this, and what would be better?
[27:33.770 --> 27:36.510]  I'd say, bro, this would really fuck up growing for everybody.
[27:37.290 --> 27:40.150]  I'd say, this would work, and then Mike would go to city council and explain my case.
[27:40.150 --> 27:43.510]  Mike's got the ... I'm wearing a collared shirt today, but it's a little chilly in here.
[27:43.510 --> 27:46.550]  Mike's got the button-up shirt and the tie and the glasses, and he looks real good for
[27:46.550 --> 27:47.550]  speaking.
[27:47.550 --> 27:51.070]  I look good in the growing on the podcast, but send the right person for the right job.
[27:51.070 --> 27:52.070]  That's a big part of it.
[27:52.070 --> 27:54.210]  Get some educated people.
[27:54.210 --> 27:55.990]  Those are some of the things that I would definitely change.
[27:55.990 --> 27:57.390]  Let me recap.
[27:57.390 --> 27:59.350]  Too much packaging.
[27:59.350 --> 28:01.750]  Limits on how much you can purchase.
[28:01.750 --> 28:05.630]  Something I overlooked in my notes, limits on potency.
[28:05.750 --> 28:12.030]  I see a lot of proposals to ban high-potency products in recreational and medical markets.
[28:12.030 --> 28:13.230]  That is nonsense.
[28:13.230 --> 28:14.470]  That is really silly.
[28:14.470 --> 28:15.470]  Try to battle that.
[28:15.470 --> 28:17.470]  Try to make sure that doesn't happen.
[28:17.470 --> 28:20.110]  We want highly potent products.
[28:20.110 --> 28:24.990]  Would you rather me ... If you were a medical professional, would you rather me take six
[28:24.990 --> 28:29.670]  inhales of smoke through my lungs, or would you rather me take two and get the relief
[28:29.670 --> 28:30.670]  that I'm looking for?
[28:30.670 --> 28:35.070]  I think higher-potency product, where I only have to smoke two drags of that product, I'm
[28:35.070 --> 28:36.470]  going to feel better.
[28:36.470 --> 28:42.790]  My lungs won't get as much stress than taking six pulls, six drags, six bong rips.
[28:42.790 --> 28:44.670]  Higher-potency product is how you achieve that.
[28:44.670 --> 28:51.870]  Potency levels, then smoke lounges, delivery, and education is something I would definitely
[28:51.870 --> 28:52.870]  try to work toward.
[28:52.870 --> 28:56.790]  Now, I know you said things that you would avoid, but those are the things that I would
[28:56.790 --> 28:57.790]  include.
[28:57.790 --> 29:02.390]  I'm not sure exactly what to avoid at this point.
[29:02.390 --> 29:04.350]  I think I included what I wanted to say for that part.
[29:04.870 --> 29:08.150]  I kind of just twisted your question and made it my own, but hey, that's how we do things.
[29:08.150 --> 29:09.470]  All right, there is more of this.
[29:09.470 --> 29:14.110]  It says, sacred tree organic farms would like to do everything possible to progress the
[29:14.110 --> 29:16.350]  industry for the Eastern United States.
[29:16.350 --> 29:17.870]  That's a really good mission statement.
[29:17.870 --> 29:19.630]  Don't ever forget that you said that.
[29:19.630 --> 29:23.990]  It says, what has been a successful approach to having these discussions with city council
[29:23.990 --> 29:26.910]  members, et cetera?
[29:26.910 --> 29:30.350]  I think I started really well by saying, send the right team member.
[29:30.350 --> 29:31.750]  Send somebody that speaks well.
[29:31.750 --> 29:32.950]  There's a person in our community.
[29:33.910 --> 29:35.470]  I'm not trying to be disrespectful to them.
[29:35.470 --> 29:40.070]  I'm not going to say their name, but at the end of every sentence they say, they say,
[29:40.070 --> 29:42.670]  use guys, you know?
[29:42.670 --> 29:44.430]  It's hard to take them seriously.
[29:44.430 --> 29:47.950]  They may hear this, love you, bro, but it's hard to fucking take you seriously.
[29:47.950 --> 29:51.430]  Use guys, you know?
[29:51.430 --> 29:52.430]  I'm not criticizing.
[29:52.430 --> 29:53.430]  I am.
[29:53.430 --> 29:54.430]  I am.
[29:54.430 --> 29:57.470]  He's a good dude, but he is not the fucking person to send to city council.
[29:57.470 --> 29:58.790]  Mike speaks well.
[29:58.790 --> 30:00.750]  Mike speaks with a professional manner.
[30:00.750 --> 30:02.470]  Find somebody with that approach.
[30:02.990 --> 30:07.710]  Find somebody that understands your goal, our goal, and then can convey that in a very
[30:07.710 --> 30:10.510]  professional well-spoken manner to city council.
[30:10.510 --> 30:12.150]  You don't want a hothead.
[30:12.150 --> 30:16.190]  You don't want somebody who is irresponsible, who looks disheveled, who is frazzled, who
[30:16.190 --> 30:17.190]  is late.
[30:17.190 --> 30:21.870]  You want somebody put together who can represent you in the light you want to be represented
[30:21.870 --> 30:22.950]  in.
[30:22.950 --> 30:25.950]  If you want to do it, if you can do it, go do it.
[30:25.950 --> 30:27.750]  Try to look good, smell good.
[30:27.750 --> 30:28.950]  Don't smell like ganja.
[30:28.950 --> 30:29.950]  Don't be high.
[30:29.950 --> 30:31.030]  Don't go in there red-eyed.
[30:31.030 --> 30:34.390]  City council, bro, I really think we got to legalize weed, man.
[30:34.390 --> 30:35.710]  Go in professionally.
[30:35.710 --> 30:36.910]  That's something really important.
[30:36.910 --> 30:38.410]  So pick somebody.
[30:38.410 --> 30:40.830]  Pick somebody that you think can be a very good representative.
[30:40.830 --> 30:41.830]  I keep saying Mike.
[30:41.830 --> 30:44.670]  Mike is the dude here.
[30:44.670 --> 30:50.270]  Then be open and honest about your goals and your ideas of what you want for the industry
[30:50.270 --> 30:53.270]  and for the future and for your business.
[30:53.270 --> 30:57.230]  The city council people, the people that you're going to talk to, although most of them are
[30:57.230 --> 30:59.750]  tainted by the devil, they are people.
[30:59.750 --> 31:01.550]  They'll hear what you're saying as a person.
[31:01.550 --> 31:03.550]  They're going to put that smug face on.
[31:03.550 --> 31:05.910]  They're going to do the smug shit that city council people do.
[31:05.910 --> 31:09.630]  But when they get home and they're chilling and they're thinking, it might hit them.
[31:09.630 --> 31:11.670]  That one guy spoke really well.
[31:11.670 --> 31:15.770]  The thing he said about the economy, making a lot of money and putting the money back
[31:15.770 --> 31:20.790]  into the schools and allocating a portion of our profit from the cannabis to educate
[31:20.790 --> 31:24.470]  the school, that really does work out because that school is losing money.
[31:24.470 --> 31:28.030]  All the potholes on that one street, we could probably fill those with the weed money too.
[31:28.030 --> 31:32.510]  If you speak clearly, honestly, tell them your objective and let them know that we're
[31:32.510 --> 31:33.510]  people.
[31:33.510 --> 31:34.510]  We're not drug addicts.
[31:34.510 --> 31:38.350]  We're not fucking crazy people out there trying to poison the kids and brainwash the neighborhood.
[31:38.350 --> 31:40.550]  We would like to contribute to the community.
[31:40.550 --> 31:41.610]  We offer a service.
[31:41.610 --> 31:43.470]  We offer a profitable service.
[31:43.470 --> 31:44.890]  We offer tax money.
[31:44.890 --> 31:46.030]  They want our tax money.
[31:46.030 --> 31:48.310]  When you talk about money, they really like that.
[31:48.310 --> 31:52.790]  When you let them know that the black market is selling and buying cannabis anyway and
[31:52.790 --> 31:55.990]  we can tax it, they start going, you know, they're right.
[31:55.990 --> 32:00.430]  You let them know that you can free up police hours by not having them fuck with weed growers
[32:00.430 --> 32:02.910]  and weed smokers and people with weed.
[32:02.910 --> 32:05.830]  The cops go, that'll give us a lot more time to handle real crime.
[32:05.830 --> 32:08.190]  They'll start seeing and realizing that stuff.
[32:08.190 --> 32:09.190]  Be open.
[32:09.190 --> 32:10.190]  Be honest.
[32:10.190 --> 32:11.550]  Have a real conversation.
[32:11.550 --> 32:14.250]  Then also be fucking persistent.
[32:14.250 --> 32:15.510]  They won't hear you the first time.
[32:15.510 --> 32:17.230]  They won't hear you the third time.
[32:17.230 --> 32:18.230]  They're like parents.
[32:18.230 --> 32:21.470]  You're going to have to just keep telling them and telling them and telling them.
[32:21.470 --> 32:22.930]  Cannabis is what our city needs.
[32:22.930 --> 32:24.270]  Cannabis is not a problem.
[32:24.270 --> 32:25.430]  Cannabis is the answer.
[32:25.430 --> 32:27.670]  With cannabis, we could have solved this.
[32:27.670 --> 32:30.030]  That deficit you're looking for, that way you're looking to make money.
[32:30.030 --> 32:33.950]  If we had opened dispensary six months ago, we'd be making enough money just from their
[32:33.950 --> 32:37.910]  licensing to cover the deficit we are experiencing this quarter.
[32:37.910 --> 32:42.830]  Find ways to spin it for them and show them that cannabis is the way to help your community.
[32:42.830 --> 32:45.390]  But be professional.
[32:45.390 --> 32:48.350]  Be open and honest and have conversations.
[32:48.350 --> 32:53.110]  Then out of nowhere, it happened here, one of the city council people will come up to
[32:53.110 --> 32:57.030]  you and secretly, privately be like, hey, I'm on your team, but I'm not sure how to
[32:57.030 --> 32:58.590]  fucking play the rest of my team.
[32:58.590 --> 33:00.590]  But just know that I've got your back.
[33:00.590 --> 33:03.030]  You'll make a connection within city council and they'll help you.
[33:03.030 --> 33:04.630]  They'll be your friend forever.
[33:04.630 --> 33:07.390]  Then you'll be able to get info and do things like that.
[33:07.390 --> 33:09.710]  Then build relationships.
[33:09.710 --> 33:10.710]  It's not a race.
[33:10.710 --> 33:11.710]  It's a marathon.
[33:11.710 --> 33:14.110]  At the beginning of this, everybody thought it was a gold rush.
[33:14.110 --> 33:17.150]  They wanted to get in, get rich, get out.
[33:17.150 --> 33:18.150]  Stick around.
[33:18.950 --> 33:19.950]  You're from Colorado.
[33:19.950 --> 33:21.150]  You know how to do this.
[33:21.150 --> 33:24.510]  Go in and realize you're going to be here forever.
[33:24.510 --> 33:26.190]  You've got good education.
[33:26.190 --> 33:27.190]  You've got good ideas.
[33:27.190 --> 33:28.950]  You probably have a good business structure.
[33:28.950 --> 33:30.230]  Go in and be an example.
[33:30.230 --> 33:33.310]  Set a standard and show them that you know how to do that.
[33:33.310 --> 33:38.430]  I really think that showing that we've got business plans and paperwork and backing and
[33:38.430 --> 33:41.510]  that we're not just a bunch of potheads and drug addicts, it's really important that we
[33:41.510 --> 33:46.070]  show that because that's their first ... Normally, when you go to a business meeting, the business
[33:46.110 --> 33:50.190]  people are like, how can we tell this motherfucker we don't want to give them our money?
[33:50.190 --> 33:51.390]  That's their main objective.
[33:51.390 --> 33:52.950]  How can we tell them no?
[33:52.950 --> 33:54.850]  What flaws can we find in their business plan?
[33:54.850 --> 33:58.430]  How can we tell them that they need to go rework their business plan because their numbers
[33:58.430 --> 34:00.070]  are wrong and all this shit sucks?
[34:00.070 --> 34:03.910]  That's what a business advisor and somebody, a financial advisor, that's one of their jobs.
[34:03.910 --> 34:06.470]  They're paid to be a dickhead and crush your dreams.
[34:06.470 --> 34:10.990]  When you go in there and you say marijuana first or cannabis first, they don't even get
[34:10.990 --> 34:15.550]  to the part about looking at your numbers, looking at your reports, looking at your
[34:15.550 --> 34:16.550]  performance sheets.
[34:16.550 --> 34:18.070]  They don't care about any of that stuff.
[34:18.070 --> 34:20.670]  They say, cannabis, get out of here, drug addict pothead.
[34:20.670 --> 34:23.110]  You've got to beat that before you even get in the room.
[34:23.110 --> 34:24.110]  You've got to look sharp.
[34:24.110 --> 34:25.110]  You've got to be clean.
[34:25.110 --> 34:26.350]  You've got to have white, bright eyes.
[34:26.350 --> 34:28.950]  You've got to brush your teeth, comb your hair if you can.
[34:28.950 --> 34:32.910]  See, I can't do that, so I'm not going to be the guy to go.
[34:32.910 --> 34:35.010]  Get somebody that can look good and build a relationship.
[34:35.010 --> 34:38.430]  Just know that you're going in there forever to build a long-term relationship.
[34:38.430 --> 34:40.790]  You're not trying to pull the wool over somebody's eyes.
[34:40.790 --> 34:42.230]  You're not trying to pull a trick on anybody.
[34:42.230 --> 34:47.030]  You want to let them know, hey, we offer a service for your community, and in return,
[34:47.030 --> 34:50.510]  we will also ... Money will go back into the community.
[34:50.510 --> 34:54.190]  Tax money will go back into the community and will also help to prevent crime, and we
[34:54.190 --> 34:56.070]  will contribute to education.
[34:56.070 --> 34:59.910]  That sounds like a great fucking deal for any city, especially in these times.
[34:59.910 --> 35:04.550]  All right, there's more to this, and I'm getting rambly and the podcast is getting long.
[35:04.550 --> 35:07.390]  Shout out to all the people that ask for longer episodes.
[35:07.390 --> 35:11.550]  One Patreon question, approximately 40 minutes, big up.
[35:11.550 --> 35:12.550]  Here we go.
[35:12.550 --> 35:17.630]  This part says, for a new brand coming into the market, what advice would you give to
[35:17.630 --> 35:23.390]  help us reach as many patients as possible other than social media and business cards?
[35:23.390 --> 35:25.870]  Well, that's a really good question.
[35:25.870 --> 35:28.670]  That's part of my consultation package, so you're going to get a freebie.
[35:28.670 --> 35:30.870]  Here, you guys take some notes.
[35:30.870 --> 35:33.790]  Social media is a big part of advertising.
[35:33.790 --> 35:35.230]  It is free.
[35:35.230 --> 35:37.990]  You can't utilize the shit out of free advertising.
[35:37.990 --> 35:41.510]  Of course, you've got to be careful because a lot of the big guys in the social media
[35:41.510 --> 35:45.270]  space don't like our products, but if you're smart about it and you learn how to dance
[35:45.270 --> 35:50.110]  around the algorithms and dance around the terms of service and not do anything too stupid,
[35:50.110 --> 35:54.430]  social media advertising is one of the best free advertising models there is.
[35:54.430 --> 35:56.670]  It's great because it's free to you.
[35:56.670 --> 35:59.190]  It's free to the consumer, which means everybody's there.
[35:59.190 --> 36:00.230]  I'm looking for sneakers.
[36:00.230 --> 36:01.230]  I'm looking at drum sets.
[36:01.230 --> 36:04.470]  I might be looking at butts, to be quite honest with you, but if you sneak your dispensary
[36:04.470 --> 36:08.030]  ad in there, I'm going to see it and it's going to hypnotize me because my brain is
[36:08.030 --> 36:12.150]  looking at all the shit that I really want to see and now you just snuck your dispensary
[36:12.150 --> 36:14.030]  ad in there and it's kind of programmed.
[36:14.030 --> 36:15.590]  It's in that, ooh, good stuff.
[36:15.590 --> 36:16.590]  Ooh, good stuff.
[36:16.590 --> 36:17.590]  Ooh, look, drums.
[36:17.590 --> 36:18.590]  Ooh, look, sneakers.
[36:18.590 --> 36:19.590]  Ooh, look, drums.
[36:19.590 --> 36:20.590]  Ooh, look, sneakers.
[36:20.590 --> 36:22.310]  Dispensary, it's hitting right in those good notes.
[36:22.310 --> 36:24.870]  You just got right in the mix on accident.
[36:24.870 --> 36:28.630]  It's like a subliminal thing that I'm going to enjoy now and that I'm interested in.
[36:28.630 --> 36:31.310]  That social media shit, don't overlook that.
[36:31.310 --> 36:34.350]  That's free and it's a great way of advertising, but you ask for other stuff.
[36:35.230 --> 36:40.870]  So, most cities have a local scene paper.
[36:40.870 --> 36:42.790]  It's probably named something cool.
[36:42.790 --> 36:46.270]  Like in Colorado Springs, it's called, no, in Pueblo, it's called the Independent.
[36:46.270 --> 36:48.050]  It might be the same thing in Colorado Springs.
[36:48.050 --> 36:49.950]  The Colorado Springs Independent.
[36:49.950 --> 36:52.770]  In the Denver area, they've got the Westward.
[36:52.770 --> 36:56.370]  In your area, it's probably called something cool also in HIP.
[36:56.370 --> 37:02.390]  It's a little, it's a thin paper magazine, local scene magazine.
[37:02.430 --> 37:06.070]  Basically in the back of that, you can find ads for all of the dispensaries, all of the
[37:06.070 --> 37:08.750]  weed doctors, all the tattoo shops.
[37:08.750 --> 37:12.830]  They advertise all the concerts that are coming up and the shows on the page right before
[37:12.830 --> 37:13.830]  that.
[37:13.830 --> 37:15.030]  I think that's a great place to advertise.
[37:15.030 --> 37:19.670]  A lot of people, when Colorado was new and the legal market, we would just go get the
[37:19.670 --> 37:22.390]  Westward and the Independent and just turn right to the back.
[37:22.390 --> 37:27.710]  You just start backwards basically and look for the dispensary ads and the weed doctors
[37:27.710 --> 37:31.110]  and the tattoo shops and the concerts because I didn't care about all the articles and shit
[37:31.110 --> 37:32.110]  in the front.
[37:32.830 --> 37:35.630]  I don't care what's going on in your city and in your art district and all that shit.
[37:35.630 --> 37:36.630]  Where's the dispensary?
[37:36.630 --> 37:39.390]  I'm just kind of joking, but that's the way we would do it.
[37:39.390 --> 37:41.070]  That's a good place of advertising.
[37:41.070 --> 37:44.070]  All that local advertising is great.
[37:44.070 --> 37:45.270]  Events.
[37:45.270 --> 37:46.430]  Go to events.
[37:46.430 --> 37:49.630]  That is something that a lot of companies forget.
[37:49.630 --> 37:53.310]  Events like the Indo Expo or whatever cup is in your neighborhood or whatever place
[37:53.310 --> 37:58.750]  you can go where there are consumers and vendors and companies meeting, go there.
[37:58.750 --> 38:03.190]  Find a good representative with business cards, with stickers, with samples, with something
[38:03.190 --> 38:04.550]  they can give away.
[38:04.550 --> 38:07.390]  Just cheap swag that when they're emptying out their bag on the table, they'll read the
[38:07.390 --> 38:09.070]  pen and they'll go, oh, I read genetics.
[38:09.070 --> 38:10.070]  I remember them.
[38:10.070 --> 38:11.070]  They'll go Google it.
[38:11.070 --> 38:13.230]  Maybe they'll find you on Instagram.
[38:13.230 --> 38:14.230]  Events are a great place.
[38:14.230 --> 38:15.830]  Go network and meet the people.
[38:15.830 --> 38:16.830]  Go shake their hands.
[38:16.830 --> 38:18.230]  Go see them face to face.
[38:18.230 --> 38:19.630]  That's how they remember you.
[38:19.630 --> 38:21.470]  That's how they find you.
[38:21.470 --> 38:25.350]  Word of mouth is really a great way of advertising.
[38:25.350 --> 38:27.270]  Have amazing customer service.
[38:27.270 --> 38:28.910]  Have quality products.
[38:28.910 --> 38:31.510]  Set the vibe and tone that you wish to set.
[38:31.510 --> 38:34.630]  Then the clientele that you want in there will arrive.
[38:34.630 --> 38:37.270]  If you want ... I don't know what kind of vibe you want to set.
[38:37.270 --> 38:41.470]  If you want to make a reggae dispensary, paint everything red, gold, and green, play Bob
[38:41.470 --> 38:46.070]  Marley all day, theme all your shit reggae, you will get the reggae crowd.
[38:46.070 --> 38:47.470]  You'll get all the white guy rastas.
[38:47.470 --> 38:48.830]  You'll get all the rastas.
[38:48.830 --> 38:50.270]  You'll get all the reggae fans.
[38:50.270 --> 38:52.070]  You'll get all the cool reggae girls coming in.
[38:52.390 --> 38:55.710]  It'll be all the hip crowd coming in, but you'll limit yourself.
[38:55.710 --> 39:00.230]  You will definitely get the reggae crowd, the rasta crowd, the vibes crowd, but you
[39:00.230 --> 39:04.990]  might not get the soccer moms that would come in and just grab a couple of grams every week.
[39:04.990 --> 39:08.390]  You might not get the older guys that don't want to come in there and listen to reggae.
[39:08.390 --> 39:11.630]  You might get the older ladies that are afraid of all the dreadlock white guys because they
[39:11.630 --> 39:13.910]  just don't understand what's going on.
[39:13.910 --> 39:16.950]  It's up to you to create the vibe and bring in the clientele that you want.
[39:16.950 --> 39:20.770]  Maybe you got the classic rock dispensary that's got guitars on the wall and pictures
[39:20.770 --> 39:24.610]  of Corvettes and shit everywhere and all the guys with mullets and long hair and leather
[39:24.610 --> 39:28.170]  jackets and Levi jackets and shit come and shop at your dispensary.
[39:28.170 --> 39:29.170]  That's great.
[39:29.170 --> 39:31.890]  Or maybe you've got this super swanky place that looks like a fucking Apple store.
[39:31.890 --> 39:33.090]  Those are always weird to me.
[39:33.090 --> 39:34.090]  I don't like those places.
[39:34.090 --> 39:38.610]  It's a little bit too much for a weed store, but set up the vibe that you like and the
[39:38.610 --> 39:41.590]  clientele will spread the word of mouth.
[39:41.590 --> 39:43.170]  Have amazing customer service.
[39:43.170 --> 39:44.970]  Go above and beyond.
[39:44.970 --> 39:47.330]  Don't nickel and dime your customers to death.
[39:47.330 --> 39:52.050]  I've seen dispensaries just charge a little extra for every fucking thing and it just
[39:52.050 --> 39:53.450]  feels cheap.
[39:53.450 --> 39:56.250]  Don't charge me for the container you're going to put my product in.
[39:56.250 --> 39:57.250]  I have to have it.
[39:57.250 --> 40:00.370]  It just feels like you're just like, just fucking give me that.
[40:00.370 --> 40:02.090]  You already charged me $100 for the weed.
[40:02.090 --> 40:05.490]  That $2 fucking container isn't going to hurt you, but it makes you look like an asshole
[40:05.490 --> 40:07.150]  charging me two bucks for it.
[40:07.150 --> 40:10.850]  So just throw my weed in the good container and smile and I'm going to say, oh, they gave
[40:10.850 --> 40:12.810]  me this nice container for my weed.
[40:12.810 --> 40:17.850]  It makes the experience fucking way different than two bucks for a shitty container or wow.
[40:17.850 --> 40:20.050]  Look at this nice container they gave me for my weed.
[40:20.050 --> 40:24.370]  And if they're selling it to me for two bucks, it costs them 50 cents and that's changing
[40:24.370 --> 40:29.090]  the entire customer interaction, the whole vibe of the experience.
[40:29.090 --> 40:32.950]  So don't nickel and dime your people, build the crowd that you want, but you have the
[40:32.950 --> 40:37.930]  ability to cultivate the audience and the crowd and the customers that you want at your
[40:37.930 --> 40:38.930]  dispensary.
[40:39.330 --> 40:41.890]  Use the kind of art that brings the crowd you want.
[40:41.890 --> 40:43.170]  Decorate the way you want.
[40:43.170 --> 40:47.410]  I wouldn't be a good person to decorate the dispensary, the waiting room, the dispensary
[40:47.410 --> 40:48.610]  area, the design of that.
[40:48.610 --> 40:49.730]  That wouldn't be for me.
[40:49.730 --> 40:51.090]  I'm kind of a streamlined dude.
[40:51.090 --> 40:52.090]  I like straight lines.
[40:52.090 --> 40:53.370]  I like a nice flow.
[40:53.370 --> 40:55.530]  I don't need a lot of distracting colors.
[40:55.530 --> 40:57.590]  If it were up to me, the walls would probably be gray.
[40:57.590 --> 40:58.770]  The floor would be fucking white.
[40:58.770 --> 41:01.070]  You just go in, you buy weed and you'd go out.
[41:01.070 --> 41:05.450]  If you let somebody with some flow and some experience and some ideas do it, it may be
[41:05.450 --> 41:07.330]  a more beautiful customer experience.
[41:07.490 --> 41:09.690]  They may go in and say, wow, this place is decorated so nice.
[41:09.690 --> 41:11.090]  I just want to go there to look at the art.
[41:11.090 --> 41:14.370]  And then they'll go in and they'll say, oh, the shopping experience is set up so nice
[41:14.370 --> 41:17.530]  that I just want to come here compared to other places.
[41:17.530 --> 41:20.170]  So have it set up well.
[41:20.170 --> 41:24.330]  Then cultivate the audience and the customer interaction that you want.
[41:24.330 --> 41:26.990]  They will share their experience there.
[41:26.990 --> 41:29.370]  Everybody will tell everybody the experience they had there.
[41:29.370 --> 41:32.970]  If the little old ladies enjoy it, they're going to tell the other little old ladies.
[41:32.970 --> 41:34.570]  If they're comfortable there, you will get them.
[41:34.570 --> 41:36.410]  If the bros like it, they'll go there.
[41:36.450 --> 41:38.370]  If the snobs like it, they'll go there.
[41:38.370 --> 41:40.970]  If the hash heads like it, they will go there.
[41:40.970 --> 41:43.410]  Try to have quality products.
[41:43.410 --> 41:47.770]  That's one of the main things to focus on is quality products at a fair price.
[41:47.770 --> 41:49.810]  Don't do any shady, shifty shit.
[41:49.810 --> 41:53.250]  Then have people with experience and education working there.
[41:53.250 --> 41:55.530]  That's something that we lack here in Colorado.
[41:55.530 --> 41:56.530]  We'll hire people.
[41:56.530 --> 41:58.550]  As long as you're cute, you can work here.
[41:58.550 --> 42:01.210]  We don't care if you know anything about weed or if you can make change.
[42:01.210 --> 42:05.350]  If you're cute, we'll fucking hire you and then figure out the rest as we go.
[42:05.350 --> 42:06.910]  That kind of sucks sometimes.
[42:06.910 --> 42:07.910]  Have quality employees.
[42:07.910 --> 42:09.650]  That will really help us out.
[42:09.650 --> 42:14.110]  Another thing, and this is kind of a random mention, creative advertising.
[42:14.110 --> 42:19.030]  Right now, my friend Jamiri Morgan, big up to Jamiri Morgan from the Morgan family.
[42:19.030 --> 42:21.430]  Jamiri is an up and coming reggae artist.
[42:21.430 --> 42:22.830]  I think he's getting quite popular.
[42:22.830 --> 42:24.490]  He's doing a lot of shows.
[42:24.490 --> 42:30.350]  The brand IRI Genetics is currently sponsoring Jamiri Morgan on a few shows of this tour.
[42:30.350 --> 42:35.830]  That IRI Genetics banner will be hanging on the side of the stage while the band plays.
[42:35.830 --> 42:37.470]  That is a creative way of advertising.
[42:37.470 --> 42:41.030]  My logo is on the stage while the reggae band is playing.
[42:41.030 --> 42:42.470]  They're wearing my shirts.
[42:42.470 --> 42:45.430]  They've got my stickers and my advertising at their booth.
[42:45.430 --> 42:46.950]  What more could you ask for?
[42:46.950 --> 42:48.570]  Things like that will really help you out.
[42:48.570 --> 42:49.950]  That is creative advertising.
[42:49.950 --> 42:54.230]  Of course, that sort of stuff takes ... You've got to cultivate relationships and there is
[42:54.230 --> 42:59.630]  a fee for stuff like that, but creative advertising is a good way for people to see you.
[42:59.830 --> 43:05.150]  Don't forget about the cliche and very common applications and websites that are very popular.
[43:05.150 --> 43:06.670]  They don't pay me to talk about them.
[43:06.670 --> 43:07.670]  They don't give me any love.
[43:07.670 --> 43:11.750]  They don't give me any fist bumps, but don't forget about things like Leafly and Weedmaps.
[43:11.750 --> 43:18.070]  A lot of people are big haters on those applications, of those applications, but so many people
[43:18.070 --> 43:22.470]  view those apps on a daily basis that if you don't put your dispensary and your products
[43:22.470 --> 43:25.350]  there, you're probably missing something.
[43:25.350 --> 43:26.350]  Big advice.
[43:26.350 --> 43:31.630]  If you don't put your dispensary on any of those services, please update the damn menu.
[43:31.630 --> 43:36.910]  If your menu is updated on maybe like every four hour basis, it shouldn't be that hard.
[43:36.910 --> 43:37.910]  I understand.
[43:37.910 --> 43:39.550]  I've worked at a dispensary before.
[43:39.550 --> 43:43.030]  You can have a person responsible for doing that, an assistant manager.
[43:43.030 --> 43:45.990]  There's somebody that loves to sit there and play on the fucking computer all day, make
[43:45.990 --> 43:47.510]  it their job.
[43:47.510 --> 43:49.070]  Update that inventory.
[43:49.070 --> 43:52.710]  If I can go on your Weedmaps and click and see that you have got the products I want
[43:52.710 --> 43:55.770]  in stock versus I wonder if they've got what I want.
[43:56.190 --> 44:00.010]  I'm going to the place where I can look on Weedmaps and it says we have got this in stock.
[44:00.010 --> 44:02.530]  I will go there first.
[44:02.530 --> 44:03.890]  Update your Weedmaps.
[44:03.890 --> 44:04.890]  That sounds silly.
[44:04.890 --> 44:08.530]  That sounds like a very minor detail, but as a consumer, I've worked on both sides of
[44:08.530 --> 44:09.530]  the counter.
[44:09.530 --> 44:11.530]  I've been a consumer and I've been a bud tender.
[44:11.530 --> 44:13.210]  I've been a dispensary manager.
[44:13.210 --> 44:14.730]  I've been a grower.
[44:14.730 --> 44:17.690]  I've been all over the weed industry.
[44:17.690 --> 44:19.290]  Part of my job was recon.
[44:19.290 --> 44:23.410]  When we were building dispensaries and getting started, one of the first places I worked
[44:23.490 --> 44:27.690]  on my day off, I would go to other dispensaries and just see what they're doing, how it's
[44:27.690 --> 44:29.170]  set up.
[44:29.170 --> 44:32.070]  What do I love and what do I not love about this dispensary?
[44:32.070 --> 44:35.090]  What can I borrow from this idea to make my place better?
[44:35.090 --> 44:36.290]  I've been to a lot of places.
[44:36.290 --> 44:37.970]  I've been on both sides of the counter.
[44:37.970 --> 44:41.010]  I think I've got a lot of experience.
[44:41.010 --> 44:42.810]  Cultivate the audience you want to bring.
[44:42.810 --> 44:44.570]  Create the vibe you want to bring.
[44:44.570 --> 44:46.970]  It sounds like you're a very smart person.
[44:46.970 --> 44:49.930]  Quality products and good customer service are the bottom line.
[44:49.930 --> 44:50.930]  That's what wins.
[44:51.450 --> 44:54.890]  If the people want to go there because you're cool and you're nice and the products are
[44:54.890 --> 44:56.530]  quality, they'll go there.
[44:56.530 --> 44:58.290]  If you've got one, you'll get some people.
[44:58.290 --> 45:00.010]  If you've got the other, you'll get some people.
[45:00.010 --> 45:04.250]  But if you've got quality products and great customer service, people will flock to your
[45:04.250 --> 45:05.250]  place.
[45:05.250 --> 45:08.530]  Word of mouth will make that happen very easily.
[45:08.530 --> 45:13.530]  Social media is almost word of mouth right now because people talk more on social media
[45:13.530 --> 45:14.930]  than we do in person.
[45:14.930 --> 45:20.770]  I talk to way more people on my phone than I do in public, in person on a daily basis
[45:21.610 --> 45:24.690]  which as I'm saying that, that sounds wrong and feels weird but that's the reality.
[45:24.690 --> 45:28.650]  I can post something and between all of the different accounts and services that I've
[45:28.650 --> 45:32.370]  got on Cannabuzz, I've got over 60,000 followers.
[45:32.370 --> 45:36.290]  I can post something and 60,000 people are going to see it and it's free.
[45:36.290 --> 45:40.850]  On Instagram, I've got 32,000 followers and I can post something and people will see it
[45:40.850 --> 45:42.610]  and it's free.
[45:42.610 --> 45:43.610]  That's word of mouth.
[45:43.610 --> 45:44.610]  That's social media advertising.
[45:44.610 --> 45:49.370]  Please do not discredit that even though you did say no social media.
[45:49.370 --> 45:51.610]  I think I've been rambling on this message for a long time.
[45:51.610 --> 45:54.610]  This actually may be the only message of this podcast.
[45:54.610 --> 45:58.490]  The last part of the message says, thank you for all you do and hopefully this can make
[45:58.490 --> 46:02.370]  it on the show to help spread our message and help other growers looking to start a
[46:02.370 --> 46:06.570]  cannabis business get solid information on what direction to go.
[46:06.570 --> 46:10.970]  Yes, my friend, I hope we did give you and other people out there looking to get into
[46:10.970 --> 46:13.050]  the industry some solid information.
[46:13.050 --> 46:14.610]  This is a great start.
[46:14.610 --> 46:18.050]  If you are really serious about getting into the industry, my friend Colin here knows what
[46:18.050 --> 46:19.050]  he's doing.
[46:19.730 --> 46:23.250]  He's going to give you this advice, but I am great at setting up and giving advice and
[46:23.250 --> 46:26.450]  doing consultations for the back of the house, the grow.
[46:26.450 --> 46:28.010]  I've got that all figured out.
[46:28.010 --> 46:30.370]  I can also help you set up the front of the house.
[46:30.370 --> 46:32.090]  I'll use Mike's help on that.
[46:32.090 --> 46:36.770]  Then when it comes to building your dispensary, I've got a friend who is a champ at building
[46:36.770 --> 46:38.290]  dispensaries.
[46:38.290 --> 46:41.170]  She's an amazing person and an amazing dispensary starter.
[46:41.170 --> 46:45.530]  She will design the floor plan, design the layout, train your staff, set everything up,
[46:45.530 --> 46:46.530]  get you started.
[46:46.530 --> 46:48.410]  She's a champ.
[46:48.450 --> 46:52.770]  One thing that I did not mention, if you'd like to be successful in the cannabis space
[46:52.770 --> 46:56.610]  right now, this is going to be the last ramble because I didn't write this down and I just
[46:56.610 --> 47:00.490]  thought that this was super important as we were talking about myself, Mike, and my other
[47:00.490 --> 47:04.810]  consultation consultant friend.
[47:04.810 --> 47:09.130]  Right now, something that I think is really important is owning or at least being in charge
[47:09.130 --> 47:15.050]  or probably owning, I guess, all aspects of your facility.
[47:15.050 --> 47:19.610]  You need the grow, you need the extraction, you need the processing, and the dispensary.
[47:19.610 --> 47:21.770]  That way, it's all your chain.
[47:21.770 --> 47:22.770]  It's from seed to sale.
[47:22.770 --> 47:24.330]  It is all yours.
[47:24.330 --> 47:26.610]  Vertical integration is what I'm trying to say.
[47:26.610 --> 47:33.530]  The best way to do it is to control all aspects of the entire system, the grow, the processing.
[47:33.530 --> 47:36.970]  If you can do the processing, that is the best deal, but I understand that's a whole
[47:36.970 --> 47:38.730]  other license, a whole other thing.
[47:38.730 --> 47:44.170]  If you can do the grow, the processing, the extraction, and the sales, you are going to
[47:44.570 --> 47:48.410]  If you can own as many pieces of that chain as possible, that is how you set yourself
[47:48.410 --> 47:49.810]  up for maximum success.
[47:49.810 --> 47:55.930]  It would be ideal to own the grow, the processing, the edibles company, and the dispensary.
[47:55.930 --> 47:59.690]  Sometimes I do understand we've either got to process or have somebody else make edibles
[47:59.690 --> 48:05.670]  for us or buy the edibles, but the idea is to get 70% of your own products on your shelf
[48:05.670 --> 48:06.670]  and be sustainable.
[48:06.670 --> 48:12.690]  You've got to get the grow operating at maximum speed to sustain you, to get 70% of your products
[48:12.730 --> 48:15.010]  from that grow onto your shelf.
[48:15.010 --> 48:18.650]  You've got to figure out how much you sell every two months, every three months, figure
[48:18.650 --> 48:22.570]  out how much that grow can produce every two or three months, get it up to speed, get a
[48:22.570 --> 48:27.130]  nice rhythm to where you've got product in the right areas at all times, there's no shortages.
[48:27.130 --> 48:31.370]  Keep in mind that 710 and 420 come up and you're going to sell record amounts of weed
[48:31.370 --> 48:32.730]  in those weeks.
[48:32.730 --> 48:33.730]  Got to plan ahead.
[48:33.730 --> 48:39.530]  I think I'm rambling now, but own everything that you can, the entire chain, vertical integration,
[48:39.530 --> 48:40.530]  that is the key.
[48:40.530 --> 48:43.890]  I do understand if you've got to have other people step in and help out with some parts,
[48:43.890 --> 48:47.410]  but the most profitable way is vertical integration.
[48:47.410 --> 48:51.610]  Control all aspects of your product, where it comes from and where it goes from seed
[48:51.610 --> 48:52.610]  to sale.
[48:52.610 --> 48:54.130]  All right, so let's get back to wrapping this one up.
[48:54.130 --> 48:56.370]  It does again say, thank you for all you do.
[48:56.370 --> 48:57.850]  Hopefully this can make it on the show.
[48:57.850 --> 48:59.250]  Bro it more than made it on the show.
[48:59.250 --> 49:03.450]  This was the entire show and I'm sure that we did help out some other growers because
[49:03.450 --> 49:08.050]  a lot of people will be moving to new states and there will be new states coming online
[49:08.050 --> 49:09.210]  that are legal.
[49:09.210 --> 49:10.370]  The team is getting stronger.
[49:10.370 --> 49:12.250]  The green team is growing.
[49:12.250 --> 49:13.250]  Welcome everybody.
[49:13.250 --> 49:15.970]  I'm so excited to have so many legal states.
[49:15.970 --> 49:18.570]  We're going to have the whole nation here before too long.
[49:18.570 --> 49:20.890]  All right, I'm getting rambly.
