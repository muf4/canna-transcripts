[00:00.000 --> 00:05.580]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is
[00:05.580 --> 00:10.640]  time for episode 593 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. You know I like to
[00:10.640 --> 00:14.500]  start this show off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking
[00:14.500 --> 00:21.360]  dabs of Chemdog D T-1000 live batter. This is a blend of Chemdog D and T-1000.
[00:21.360 --> 00:27.060]  On the package the flavor is described as gas, lavender, and grapes. You may know
[00:27.060 --> 00:30.800]  that I'm not a big fan of lavender flavors and aromas but luckily it comes
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.260]  through with sort of a perfumey floral sort of aroma and flavor and the mix is
[00:35.260 --> 00:40.020]  dominated by that gassy grape flavor and I do enjoy that. On the back of the
[00:40.020 --> 00:46.020]  package it says it contains 69.81% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[00:46.020 --> 00:52.200]  Perfect for a podcast concentrate so big shout out to the Chemdog D T-1000 live
[00:52.200 --> 00:57.240]  batter. In this episode I'm going to read an email about foliar feeding our
[00:57.240 --> 01:00.840]  plants. Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few of the folks in
[01:00.840 --> 01:04.760]  the 710 club. Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.320]  you shout out to a longtime supporter and a good friend. Let's send a special

[01:15.640 --> 01:19.000]  up with a thank you shout out to Matt. Then let's jump into a thank you shout
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.680]  out to my buddy Godfather Kush. I want to send a fist bump to my buddy Dave's
[01:22.680 --> 01:26.400]  not here. I've always got a thank you shout out for my buddy Terp Burglar.

[01:41.360 --> 01:45.600]  least let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my
[01:45.600 --> 01:50.560]  buddy North North Terps. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports
[01:50.560 --> 01:53.800]  the show on Patreon. If you are not already supporting the show and you'd
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.400]  like to learn how to do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:59.400 --> 02:03.120]  forward slash grow from your heart all of the information you need will be
[02:03.120 --> 02:06.520]  right there on the screen and I did include a link in the show notes and in
[02:06.520 --> 02:12.520]  the video description to make it super easy for all of my friends. Alright thank
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.840]  you guys for all of the continued patreon support it does mean a lot to me
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.520]  I've said it before without all the patreon support I wouldn't have all this
[02:19.520 --> 02:23.120]  fancy lighting I wouldn't have the fancy new camera wouldn't even have the fancy
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.280]  new computer and there is an even better computer on the way because when I bought
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.840]  a 4k camera this computer said that's cute I can barely handle that so there's
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.120]  a new computer coming so thank you to everybody for the patreon support it
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.160]  does mean a lot to me and it does keep the show coming to you for free there are
[02:40.160 --> 02:43.840]  a lot of folks who are not able to contribute to patreon that is completely
[02:43.840 --> 02:47.400]  understandable the folks who do contribute are keeping this show coming
[02:47.400 --> 02:52.440]  to everybody for free thank you all right where are we gonna go from there I
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.040]  did a recent episode about tester applications and tester expectations
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.680]  that's right if you want to run test seats for me there is a process to
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.760]  submit an application to become a tester big thank you to everybody who submitted
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.600]  a tester application I got an overwhelming response an overwhelming
[03:11.600 --> 03:16.200]  amount of applications were submitted I am trying to catch up on all of those
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.280]  with that being said do not stop sending them I am overwhelmed I'm overloaded but
[03:21.280 --> 03:24.880]  I want more keep me working keep me busy keep me digging through those
[03:24.880 --> 03:29.480]  applications please continue to send in your tester applications if you are
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.720]  interested in testing one of the main things in that episode was being able to
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.360]  follow instructions there were very specific instructions on how to submit a
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.240]  testing application if you did not follow those instructions I probably did
[03:43.240 --> 03:47.080]  not notice your application there was one way to submit that application make
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.600]  sure you do it that way all of the other ways will be ignored sorry to be rude
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.880]  about it that's just you got to be able to follow instructions and if I've got
[03:54.880 --> 03:58.440]  you in my email then it's easier to find you I'm not gonna look across all of the
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.920]  social media platforms to find tester applications send them to me in one spot
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.360]  or listen to the episode again you'll figure it out also that help tab on my
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.200]  website I've added a grow help tab on iRegenetics.com if you go to
[04:12.200 --> 04:16.600]  iRegenetics.com there is a tab that simply says grow help when you click on
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.160]  that grow help tab it will ask you about seven or eight key questions it basically
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.040]  asks what is the temperature and humidity of your grow environment what
[04:25.040 --> 04:31.800]  was the last feed and pH and EC of your last feeding so I can get a few details
[04:31.800 --> 04:34.600]  about what's happening in your grow before I even try to answer your
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.000]  question so you go to the grow help tab you'll fill out a little questionnaire
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.080]  tell me the temperature tell me the humidity tell me what you fed tell me
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.720]  the pH and EC of that feed then tell me what's wrong with your plants this will
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.640]  save us both a few steps a lot of people like to email me and they say bro here's
[04:50.640 --> 04:54.160]  what's wrong with my plants and then I've got like seven or eight follow-up
[04:54.160 --> 04:57.680]  questions just to go from what they asked instead of having to ask those
[04:57.680 --> 05:01.240]  questions they're already there on the sheet so you're gonna tell me so many
[05:01.240 --> 05:04.880]  key points you're gonna give me so many hints to help me diagnose your problem
[05:04.880 --> 05:07.400]  I'm basically just giving you a little checkup I'm like when you go to the
[05:07.400 --> 05:10.400]  doctor checking your temperature looking in your ears looking in your nose
[05:10.400 --> 05:13.360]  checking out your throat looking for obvious shit maybe I can diagnose
[05:13.360 --> 05:17.160]  problems from those small obvious details so I'm gonna ask you to fill out
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.560]  that questionnaire then you send me then there's a little part that says what's
[05:20.560 --> 05:23.880]  your problem what's going on when you grow fill that out send it to me it
[05:23.880 --> 05:28.000]  comes to my email I will read that I've gotten a lot of great questions and a
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.920]  lot of great content for the podcast from that grow help tab so thank you
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.880]  also if you feel like you have not been replied to or responded to in a timely
[05:35.880 --> 05:41.040]  manner I do apologize like I said a moment ago I have been overwhelmed in a
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.480]  good way with tester applications and grow help questions I love it I
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.800]  appreciate it it keeps me busy it keeps me working I will get to all of them
[05:49.800 --> 05:54.520]  please don't feel like I'm ignoring you I read genetics is a one-man operation
[05:54.520 --> 05:58.320]  the grow from your heart podcast is a one-man operation if Mike's not on the
[05:58.320 --> 06:03.160]  show if I don't have a guest this is just a solo one-man operation team Rasta
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.400]  Jeff is I do have the irie army I've got a lot of helpers doing things like that
[06:06.400 --> 06:10.720]  but packaging the seeds breeding the seeds doing the podcast it's all just me
[06:10.720 --> 06:15.400]  all of the emails are all me so please be patient that is what I'm trying to
[06:15.400 --> 06:21.220]  say but with all of that being said keep that tester applications keep the grow
[06:21.220 --> 06:25.180]  questions keep it all coming also one more thing to talk about on the website
[06:25.180 --> 06:29.700]  I read genetics calm there is a spot to sign up for a mailing list for a
[06:29.700 --> 06:33.300]  newsletter that's right it's very easy to find on the website scroll down
[06:33.300 --> 06:37.380]  there's a spot to type in your email address put in a good email address you
[06:37.380 --> 06:41.200]  will get an auto respond from my mail chip it basically says hey thank you for
[06:41.200 --> 06:44.260]  signing up that is how you know it worked that's how I know you signed up
[06:44.260 --> 06:49.540]  then when I do special deals at a vendor like seeds here now calm you will get an
[06:49.660 --> 06:53.860]  a newsletter excuse me for stuttering I've got a lot of my brain you will get
[06:53.860 --> 06:58.500]  a notification a newsletter for things like sales at seeds here now calm for
[06:58.500 --> 07:03.740]  new strain releases exclusive strain releases maybe I'll do I just put out a
[07:03.740 --> 07:07.220]  new strain that nobody knew was even coming I had showed up at seeds here now
[07:07.220 --> 07:11.220]  calm for the Black Friday sale the people on the newsletter knew that that
[07:11.220 --> 07:15.940]  was coming so you can stay tuned for exclusive drops re-releases a lot of
[07:15.940 --> 07:19.780]  people ask me when stuff will be restocked at certain places sometimes I
[07:19.780 --> 07:23.620]  include that in the newsletter I try not to overload you but I do try to keep you
[07:23.620 --> 07:27.580]  in the loop I'm doing about once a month right now it may increase to once a week

[07:31.260 --> 07:35.180]  becomes annoying let me know I'd rather settle down than lose you as a follower

[07:48.220 --> 07:52.660]  also the tester applications don't stop but also if I don't keep up with you
[07:52.660 --> 07:57.820]  right away I apologize it is just me where are we gonna go from there oh I've
[07:57.820 --> 08:02.260]  got one more thing to ask for before we jump into some of these grow questions I
[08:02.260 --> 08:06.380]  would like a cool little logo I don't ask you for a lot but I would like a
[08:06.380 --> 08:10.140]  cool little logo just to put right about here where is it gonna go right about
[08:10.300 --> 08:14.060]  there on the screen I'm not sure how I'm gonna edit this but right about here on
[08:14.060 --> 08:18.380]  the screen it would be cool if it just said GF YH TV and had a cool little red
[08:18.380 --> 08:22.780]  yellow and green Rasta colored logo maybe something like that maybe just
[08:22.780 --> 08:26.020]  something real simple that I can just drag into the video every time and put
[08:26.020 --> 08:28.780]  it right there on the bottom right corner I just think it would look cool
[08:28.780 --> 08:32.620]  make me look super official maybe I don't know it doesn't have to be red
[08:32.620 --> 08:36.500]  yellow and green you're the artist you get creative I'll pay you for it if more
[08:36.500 --> 08:39.500]  than one person submits it I'll rotate them out put them on the bottom of the
[08:39.500 --> 08:42.900]  screen give you some credit and the credits at the end of the show I'll give
[08:42.900 --> 08:47.820]  you a gift I'll pay you in cash whatever we gots to do GF YH TV I want a little
[08:47.820 --> 08:50.820]  logo for the bottom of the screen right here you know what I'm talking about you
[08:50.820 --> 08:55.100]  know exactly what I want if you do a red yellow and green Rasta colored logo it
[08:55.100 --> 08:59.460]  is traditional that the red goes on the bottom please let's just stay respectful
[08:59.460 --> 09:03.940]  to the Rasta tradition all right I did say that was it before we jumped into
[09:03.940 --> 09:08.780]  the grow question so let's work our way right into a couple of questions I have
[09:08.780 --> 09:12.180]  gotten this question from multiple people from multiple formats and I've
[09:12.180 --> 09:16.020]  seen this asked all over social media so it is time to address this one again I
[09:16.020 --> 09:19.660]  talk about this often probably once every three to six months I've got to
[09:19.660 --> 09:25.540]  remind people of this people ask quite a bit when I am growing from seed and the
[09:25.540 --> 09:30.380]  seed pack says that the seeds are going to take 70 days in flower is that or
[09:30.380 --> 09:33.780]  they're going to take 70 days is that going to take 70 days from the day I
[09:33.780 --> 09:38.300]  plant it or from the day that I put it into flower unless they're auto flower
[09:38.300 --> 09:43.020]  plants the 70 days is the flowering time that's how long you should expect
[09:43.020 --> 09:47.380]  them to be in flower you can veg them as long as you want you can veg them for a
[09:47.380 --> 09:52.580]  day you can veg them for three weeks six weeks you can veg them for nine months
[09:52.580 --> 09:56.060]  if you've got the space and you know how to do that what we are putting on there
[09:56.060 --> 10:01.180]  as the time on the back of the package is the flowering time unless you are
[10:01.180 --> 10:04.820]  working with auto flowers and that should be clearly indicated on the
[10:04.820 --> 10:08.460]  package if you're working with auto flowers that time that's listed on there
[10:08.460 --> 10:13.020]  is the anticipated predicted time from start to finish but if you were working
[10:13.020 --> 10:18.100]  with regular photo period or feminized photo period seeds that time that we
[10:18.100 --> 10:22.940]  list on the back the flowering time is from the day is the flowering time not
[10:22.940 --> 10:27.340]  the full grow time now here's another thing I want to clarify that flowering
[10:27.340 --> 10:33.420]  time starts from the day you turn the light cycle to 1212 not from when you
[10:33.420 --> 10:39.860]  start seeing bud development that's about day 12 day 14 day 17 the flowering
[10:39.860 --> 10:46.980]  cycle officially begins the day you or somebody else turns the light cycle to
[10:46.980 --> 10:51.220]  1212 and of course this is in an indoor grow environment you flip that light
[10:51.220 --> 10:55.500]  cycle to 1212 that's day one of flower you write that down on the calendar as
[10:55.500 --> 11:00.180]  day one if you're looking at a pack of seeds and they say we finish in 63 to 70
[11:00.180 --> 11:05.660]  days day one starts right there expect that pack of seeds to be done in 63 to
[11:05.660 --> 11:11.220]  75 ish days as breeders we really try to label the packages clearly and tell you
[11:11.220 --> 11:15.580]  how long to expect we give you a time frame these are plants there is nature
[11:15.580 --> 11:19.620]  we're putting plants in different environments I'm not exactly sure what's
[11:19.620 --> 11:22.780]  going to happen in your environment I'm not sure what you're going to do to them
[11:22.780 --> 11:27.140]  to speed them up or slow them down but from our testing from what we have seen
[11:27.140 --> 11:30.260]  through research with most of these plants that is the time frame we have
[11:30.260 --> 11:34.060]  seen so I'm gonna get myself back on track back to the point when we say
[11:34.060 --> 11:39.740]  flowering time is 70 days we mean that is from the day you turn your timer from
[11:39.740 --> 11:46.260]  if it's 24 on and 0 off or 18 6 or whatever your vegetative cycle is now
[11:46.260 --> 11:50.740]  when you put it on 1212 that is day one of flower that's when your 70 day
[11:50.740 --> 11:54.660]  flowering time begins not when you see the pistols not when you see bud
[11:54.660 --> 11:59.580]  development how then that's a guess there is no that could be you might not
[11:59.580 --> 12:02.860]  have seen it right away and then do you start flowering counting flower when you
[12:02.860 --> 12:05.740]  write when you see the pistols or when they're nubby or when they're growing
[12:05.740 --> 12:10.180]  out how do you fucking do that why not just do it we know when day one is it's
[12:10.180 --> 12:13.860]  because we changed the fucking light cycle ourselves let's not guess let's
[12:13.860 --> 12:17.980]  not put so much guessing into it let's narrow down what are they called
[12:17.980 --> 12:21.460]  variables let's narrow down the variables and know that day one was the
[12:21.460 --> 12:24.780]  day that we put that bitch in the flower and then start counting from
[12:24.780 --> 12:29.100]  there keep a mark of it know that it was maybe you've got five or six plants in
[12:29.100 --> 12:34.740]  their harvest one it if it says day 70 cut one down at 68 one at 69 one at 71
[12:34.740 --> 12:38.420]  at 71 and one at 72 and see what the difference is or go even more staggered
[12:38.420 --> 12:44.780]  with your harvest go 65 70 75 80 see what happens that stuff is fun to do but
[12:44.780 --> 12:50.260]  my main point is the flowering time day one starts when you flip the timer not
[12:50.260 --> 12:53.700]  when you start seeing those little fuzzies all right that was a great
[12:53.700 --> 12:57.540]  question I see it often trust me you will hear about that again on the show
[12:57.540 --> 13:01.900]  because it gets asked very very frequently all right let's move into a
[13:01.900 --> 13:07.300]  more advanced question this one is about foliar feeding this one comes from let's
[13:07.300 --> 13:10.340]  see they want their name said I'm not sure they want their name said we're
[13:10.340 --> 13:14.580]  gonna not do that part it goes like this it says hey Rasta Jeff on the breeder
[13:14.580 --> 13:19.140]  panel yesterday you sounded awesome and your mic was booming so what they are
[13:19.140 --> 13:23.740]  referring to is I was on a breeder panel on cannabis we did a live breeder
[13:23.740 --> 13:27.660]  panel you were able to chat with the the breeders while they were on the panel
[13:27.660 --> 13:31.500]  you could watch on cannabis check out cannabis you guys I'm going to be doing
[13:31.500 --> 13:36.580]  another panel on cannabis I think I don't know that I should announce this
[13:36.580 --> 13:39.940]  yet it's not set in stone but to the best of my knowledge I'm going to make
[13:39.940 --> 13:43.660]  it happen on December 19th here we go this is my commitment this is how we
[13:43.660 --> 13:47.540]  commit to shit JR I'm in dude I'm saying it now on a show can't back out now
[13:47.540 --> 13:55.340]  December 19th I will be doing a live panel a live show on cannabis JR and Q
[13:55.340 --> 14:00.500]  grows will be interviewing me there will be a question and answer panel and I may
[14:00.500 --> 14:05.820]  even bring a couple of my friends on from cannabis to join me on zoom and
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.020]  hang out we may let them ask questions we may do some chatting some bullshitting
[14:10.020 --> 14:14.380]  we may even take some dabs together so December 19th on cannabis it will be in
[14:14.380 --> 14:18.060]  the afternoon time I don't think we've set a solid time yet it should be a one
[14:18.060 --> 14:21.460]  to two hour show that's usually what we like to do if you're not already on
[14:21.460 --> 14:25.660]  cannabis you're fucking up you're sleeping get on cannabis it is a free
[14:25.660 --> 14:30.220]  application it's available on whatever kind of phone you've got it's available
[14:30.220 --> 14:33.140]  on your iPad you can get it on the computer I think it works best on the
[14:33.140 --> 14:40.860]  phone go to your app store download cannabis c-a-n-n-a-b-u-z-z log in create
[14:40.860 --> 14:45.140]  yourself a username I'm I re underscore genetics give me a follow click like on
[14:45.140 --> 14:49.540]  all my stuff that's all you got to do then pay attention Saturday December 19th
[14:49.540 --> 14:53.740]  there will be an I read genetics cannabis live show I think it's going to
[14:53.740 --> 14:56.900]  be a great time I don't know what they've got in store for me yet I'm
[14:56.900 --> 15:01.420]  going to be prepared no matter what happens as a breeder as a podcaster I'm
[15:01.420 --> 15:04.180]  ready ask me questions let's get it on I'm ready to be there and have a good
[15:04.180 --> 15:07.680]  time and I'm just gonna relax because I am not hosting the show so it should be
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.120]  great ask me questions let's hang out let's take some dabs cannabis December
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.640]  19th and the mic is booming yes thank you that was before I got this mic I
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.720]  think so we are double booming at this point it goes on to say you can always
[15:21.720 --> 15:25.120]  tell you put a lot of time effort and money into your sound quality and it's
[15:25.120 --> 15:31.480]  noticed and appreciated dude thank you there was a lot of funding to get this
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.080]  microphone all this equipment there is so many there are so many things in this
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.520]  chain to make all this work and I've said it before without patreon I
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.440]  probably would not have happened so thank you to everybody for the patreon
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.760]  contributions I'm glad you guys are noticing the increase in audio quality
[15:46.760 --> 15:50.760]  video quality production quality I want you to see that I care you guys
[15:50.760 --> 15:55.200]  definitely take good care of me on patreon you are you bought all this
[15:55.200 --> 15:58.360]  stuff and I want you to see that I appreciate it I didn't just take all of
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.840]  your patreon funding and buy a new truck you know I bought podcasting stuff with
[16:02.840 --> 16:06.360]  that and I'm also trying to put a lot more time and energy into the podcast
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.000]  because this is fun now that I'm learning all this gear I don't know and
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.680]  it's like when you have new toys when you get a new video game or you get a
[16:12.680 --> 16:14.960]  new toy you want to go play with your new toys and video games if you got a
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.680]  new rig you want to take extra dabs I just feel like I want a podcast more
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.280]  except got all this cool shit the only thing slowing me down is this computer
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.800]  and I've got a new one coming thanks to patreon so I am high on rambly shout out
[16:27.800 --> 16:32.840]  to the chem dog DT 1000 live batter it seems to be working take some dabs of
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.400]  that where were we we're in this episode in this email and it says thank you for
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.880]  all the information you put out there my question is what nutrients and
[16:41.880 --> 16:46.600]  supplements do you find more effective or effective as a foliar spray instead
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.920]  of the standard root drench that is a great question it says I've read that
[16:50.920 --> 16:56.760]  kelp humble honey and cow mag can be more effective as a foliar spray yes
[16:56.760 --> 17:00.520]  that is accurate and we're going to talk about why and how some of those
[17:00.520 --> 17:04.600]  things are more effective as a foliar spray before we do that let's talk about
[17:04.600 --> 17:09.760]  foliar feeding why would we foliar feed our plants what is foliar feeding foliar
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.280]  feeding is exactly what it sounds like you mix a light dose of nutrients into a
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.120]  spray bottle or a sprayer however you're applying your sprays my spray
[17:18.120 --> 17:20.920]  applications are much larger in a commercial grow than they are on a
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.080]  private grow and a commercial girl I mix up a five gallon bucket or maybe even
[17:25.080 --> 17:29.480]  larger of my foliar spray if it's a pesticide if it's a booster spray I mix
[17:29.480 --> 17:33.240]  up a five gallon bucket and I use a fucking paint sprayer to just douse all
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.640]  of the plants with that spray and my personal grow I use a small just a
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.400]  little like a little Windex looking fucking spray bottle it's a big
[17:41.400 --> 17:45.560]  difference so it's the same effect it's the same idea no matter where you are
[17:45.560 --> 17:50.520]  you want to mix up a light nutrient solution you need a strategy if you're
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.520]  going to feed the plants foliar Lee if you're going to foliar feed the plants I
[17:54.520 --> 17:57.800]  don't know the wordage there but if you're going to feed them by full the
[17:57.800 --> 18:01.120]  foliar method you need to have a strategy you can't just go mixing up
[18:01.120 --> 18:03.800]  newts and spray them in there because they're going to get on the leaves this
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.720]  is way different than feeding them to the root zone there's no buffer you're
[18:07.720 --> 18:12.200]  going straight on to the plant so you need a strategy but I basically mix up a
[18:12.200 --> 18:16.280]  light nutrient solution and I spray it onto the plants when I do this the
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.000]  lights are off that is a very important thing I find it very important to always
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.480]  spray with the lights off some products do say you can spray with the lights on
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.480]  I still don't do it I just like to turn the lights off when I'm full of your
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.480]  feeding I feel like those little bubbles that land on the plants on the leaves
[18:33.480 --> 18:36.760]  think about when you were a little kid and used to burn ants with the
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.520]  magnifying glass or you could catch shit on fire with the magnifying glass it is
[18:40.520 --> 18:44.720]  the same exact method the Sun or the grow light comes down it hits that
[18:44.720 --> 18:48.920]  bubble the bubbles got that little arc that arc creates some sort of refractory
[18:48.920 --> 18:52.600]  I'm not a light and Sun scientist but we'll get there I create some sort of a
[18:52.600 --> 18:55.440]  thing that makes it works like a magnifying glass just when you used to
[18:55.440 --> 18:58.920]  hold the fucking the Sun and the magnifying glass just right and create a
[18:58.920 --> 19:02.640]  hot spot on whatever that light will come down and do the same thing to that
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.640]  bubble of foliar spray and it'll put little burn spots on your plants those
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.080]  don't go away they look like other problems they'll make you panic you'll
[19:10.080 --> 19:13.760]  think you've got bugs or some sort of deficiency when really all it was was
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.320]  just a little water burn so foliar feeding is very important to be done in
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.280]  the dark now why would we do it because we can apply specific nutrients to the
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.360]  plant at specific times and sometimes we've already watered the plants and
[19:27.360 --> 19:31.480]  they may be wet if you've got a seven gallon pot when you water that plant it
[19:31.480 --> 19:34.880]  may be wet for three to four maybe five days depending on the size of the plant
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.600]  the environment of the room you may have a nutrient deficiency or chasing you
[19:38.600 --> 19:43.160]  can't water in more nutrients but we can foliar feed some nutrients into the
[19:43.160 --> 19:47.000]  plant there are a lot of nutrients that work very well being foliar fed some are
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.400]  more effective than others we will touch on that in just a moment I want to
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.520]  make sure that I am keeping up with my notes so we can provide nutrients
[19:54.520 --> 19:59.880]  directly to the leaves if we're chasing a deficiency we can absolutely provide
[19:59.880 --> 20:02.880]  most nutrients directly to the leaves and not have to feed it through the root
[20:02.880 --> 20:08.560]  zone it's more faster acting you can watch it work it also you won't walk out
[20:08.560 --> 20:11.640]  your roots if your plants are already wet like I said you don't have to keep
[20:11.640 --> 20:15.640]  watering shit in and you're not going to walk out the roots by over feeding it's
[20:15.640 --> 20:20.440]  just another opportunity to provide nutrients to our plants now you did say
[20:20.440 --> 20:24.560]  that you read that kelp Humboldt honey and cow mag were effective as foliar
[20:24.560 --> 20:28.680]  spray I'm going to leave Humboldt honey out of this mix because that is a
[20:28.680 --> 20:33.200]  product with a lot of things in it I think that would be safer to apply to
[20:33.200 --> 20:37.000]  the root zone it's got some things in there that may clog up your plants and
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.280]  it may be more problematic if you're doing it and it works keep doing it I
[20:40.280 --> 20:45.620]  just wouldn't do that as a foliar feed the kelp and the cow mag absolutely do
[20:45.620 --> 20:50.580]  and will work wonderfully as a foliar feed let's talk about why I believe cow
[20:50.580 --> 20:56.260]  mag is a great foliar fed nutrient cow mag is what is known and is as an
[20:56.260 --> 21:00.540]  immobile nutrient it can't move itself around in the plant normally if the
[21:00.540 --> 21:04.740]  plant since the deficiency in a nutrient up in one part of the plant older leaves
[21:04.740 --> 21:07.900]  that are kind of dying off and that are gonna expire would say hey we're gonna
[21:07.900 --> 21:11.260]  die let's send some of our mobile nutrients up to that other part of the
[21:11.260 --> 21:14.860]  leaves so that they can survive and be strong and healthy since I'm gonna go
[21:14.860 --> 21:20.020]  we'll just pass the spoon right on up so cow mag cannot do that cow mag does
[21:20.020 --> 21:24.420]  not have that ability cow mag is very a very heavy nutrient that is why it is
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.940]  sold in a different bottle than all of your other nutrients if you put the cow
[21:27.940 --> 21:31.780]  mag in the bottle with the other nutrients basically it's heavier it
[21:31.780 --> 21:35.220]  would fall to the bottom in solution it wouldn't stay in the solution it would
[21:35.220 --> 21:38.740]  always be that shit at the bottom of the jar you'd be stirring and shaking and it
[21:38.740 --> 21:42.580]  would just be the the coffee grounds in your nutrient solution all the time so
[21:42.700 --> 21:47.700]  cow mag is a non or an immobile nutrient is what we call that so we can foliar
[21:47.700 --> 21:52.180]  feed that directly to the plants and that will help you rapidly correct a cow
[21:52.180 --> 21:57.940]  mag deficiency so that is one thing that is great for a foliar feed cow mag
[21:57.940 --> 22:02.820]  calcium works as a great foliar feed it's hard to find it is harder to find a
[22:02.820 --> 22:06.700]  straight calcium product but cow mag works as an effective foliar feed
[22:06.700 --> 22:11.780]  whichever brand of cow mag you are using will probably work well kelp why does
[22:11.780 --> 22:15.580]  kelp work well kelp has a lot of hormones in it kelp has a lot of phyto
[22:15.580 --> 22:20.420]  nutrients and they are all bioavailable to the plant by foliar spray those
[22:20.420 --> 22:24.580]  nutrients are mobile nutrients so you'll spray those to the plant and the plant
[22:24.580 --> 22:28.300]  if you don't overdo it you'll spray that onto the plant and it'll go oh maybe
[22:28.300 --> 22:31.740]  this leaf over here doesn't have enough nitrogen let's move that over here and
[22:31.740 --> 22:35.220]  this new leaf over here needs a little bit of phosphorus let's move that over
[22:35.220 --> 22:39.660]  here so the plants will move those mobile nutrients around as needed so
[22:39.660 --> 22:42.980]  that's basically kelp there are a lot of things in kelp I'm not gonna dig too
[22:42.980 --> 22:46.500]  deeply into that could be an episode on its own as well as cow mag could be a
[22:46.500 --> 22:51.020]  full episode on its own I want to make sure to stay on track here where are we
[22:51.020 --> 22:57.380]  going from here nitrogen nitrogen works as a great foliar feed you can mix up a
[22:57.380 --> 23:00.500]  small amount of your base nutrient if your plants are getting a little bit
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.580]  yellow and you can't feed them enough that's called chasing the nitrogen
[23:04.580 --> 23:10.860]  golden goat golden goat crosses a rise crosses lemon Jeffrey sometimes will
[23:10.860 --> 23:15.380]  become nitrogen deficient early in flower like week two or three of flower
[23:15.380 --> 23:19.780]  you'll say why is that bitch going yellow on me already a really good easy
[23:19.780 --> 23:25.380]  way to correct that is a foliar feed of nitrogen take your vegetative base
[23:25.380 --> 23:29.620]  nutrient and mix up I don't know what brand you're using so I'm not even going
[23:29.620 --> 23:32.980]  to make a recommendation way less than what you would use when you're feeding
[23:33.140 --> 23:37.940]  it to the root zone maybe like a quarter maybe a fifth maybe even less mix up
[23:37.940 --> 23:42.340]  some of that base nutrient because your base nutrient is high in nitrogen mix up
[23:42.340 --> 23:45.820]  your base nutrient into a bottle give it a good shake so it's nice and not
[23:45.820 --> 23:50.380]  distributed in there emulsified might be the word I want and foliar feed that to
[23:50.380 --> 23:54.100]  your plant that will get the nitrogen into your leaves the leaves will say hey
[23:54.100 --> 23:57.620]  this is a mobile nutrient it'll move it all around to where it needs to be that
[23:57.620 --> 24:02.340]  will help you chase and correct a nitrogen deficiency you can do the same
[24:02.340 --> 24:07.980]  with phosphorus and potassium keep in mind that as you increase phosphorus you
[24:07.980 --> 24:12.940]  do run the risk of a CalMag deficiency they work together so just keep that
[24:12.940 --> 24:15.900]  sort of stuff in mind all right now let's talk about other things that I do
[24:15.900 --> 24:20.420]  foliar feed the plants kelp is great CalMag works beautifully to correct a
[24:20.420 --> 24:27.220]  deficiency you can absolutely feed the NPK through the leaves you can watch it
[24:27.220 --> 24:30.620]  move around I feel like if you spray it in the dark give it like two hours for
[24:30.620 --> 24:34.020]  everything to dry when you go back you can see those plants have greened up a
[24:34.020 --> 24:37.140]  little bit at least I feel like I can I've got a really good relationship with
[24:37.140 --> 24:41.140]  my plants I can see their reactions it's like watching the look on people's faces
[24:41.140 --> 24:44.720]  if you walk in the room and you just say a certain word if you just say
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.420]  cheesecake if you walk in the word say cheesecake people make a certain face if
[24:48.420 --> 24:52.140]  you walk in the room and you say fart they make a different face I can see my
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.340]  plants respond in the same way that's the kind of relationship I have got with
[24:56.340 --> 24:59.740]  my plants so I feel like after I foliar feed them I can walk in there and
[24:59.740 --> 25:04.380]  absolutely see results within just a few hours now let's talk about another
[25:04.380 --> 25:10.300]  product I really like a product called push push is a great product they do not
[25:10.300 --> 25:13.300]  pay me they don't give me anything to talk about it I think it's a great
[25:13.300 --> 25:16.460]  product it is from the same folks that make veg bloom they are called
[25:16.460 --> 25:22.340]  hydroponic research you can find them online hydroponic dash research it might
[25:22.340 --> 25:29.620]  be dotnet not calm anyway push is a great product product it contains kelp
[25:29.740 --> 25:35.540]  it's got silica in there and it's got another acid that I cannot remember the
[25:35.540 --> 25:39.980]  name of and I did not write it down however it works wonderfully for the
[25:39.980 --> 25:44.500]  plants I think recharge makes the plants go kaboom at the root zone level and
[25:44.500 --> 25:49.500]  push is recharge for the top of the plants that is push for the leaves or
[25:49.500 --> 25:54.320]  that is recharge for the leaves so I think push is a great product something
[25:54.320 --> 26:00.120]  about foliar feeding always use low doses you can definitely burn your
[26:00.120 --> 26:04.280]  plants by foliar feeding you can absolutely apply too much and unlike
[26:04.280 --> 26:08.960]  when you overfeed the root zone there's it's harder much harder to recover I
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.600]  said unlike when so unlike when you overfeed the root zone you don't have a
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.080]  lot of opportunity for recovery there's no chance to fix your mistake if you
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.360]  overfeed the root zone they start showing you they go I'm gonna kind of
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.640]  brown up over here I'm gonna get kind of my nails done and burn up at the tips
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.440]  you've got time to react you can flush that soil you can feed it something
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.800]  different when you sprayed it on there you just spray painted problems onto
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.000]  your plants if you overfed it so be very careful start with low doses you can
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.440]  work your way up but you can't work your way down from a burn maybe if you're new
[26:39.440 --> 26:42.840]  at foliar feeding don't go in there and spray the entire fucking crop all at one
[26:42.840 --> 26:47.600]  time maybe spray one plant see how it reacts maybe spray two plants see how
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.560]  they react learn on a couple don't destroy everything have a couple of test
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.080]  dummies in there experiment before you go hard on the entire room I've said it
[26:56.080 --> 26:59.240]  before always spray in the dark some companies will tell you that their
[26:59.240 --> 27:02.840]  product is safe to spray when the lights are on I don't believe it please don't
[27:02.840 --> 27:07.640]  do that I've seen terrible burns on plants I don't think you should spray
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.880]  people are going to argue with me over this and that is just fine this is my
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.320]  opinion I would not spray microbe products in an organic grow if you're
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.640]  doing a TLO system if you're running labs and other things like that do that
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.520]  stuff in your no-till and organic environment if you are running I run a
[27:27.520 --> 27:33.680]  very commercial style grow there's not a lot of TLO love happening in my grow
[27:33.680 --> 27:39.040]  it's cocoa and salts and pesticide sprays and foliar sprays for boosts in
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.120]  my environment I would not recommend microbe sprays that does give you the
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.200]  opportunity for more problems in Colorado we have to pass we have to pass
[27:48.200 --> 27:54.440]  microbe testing all of our buds not all of our buds a sample from every batch is
[27:54.440 --> 27:59.840]  sent to a lab those buds are tested for the presence of yeast and mold if we are
[27:59.840 --> 28:03.880]  spraying products like I'm never gonna say any specific products if we're
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.560]  spraying microbe products on our plants we are increasing the opportunity to
[28:07.560 --> 28:12.680]  fail those microbe testings so unless you are running some sort of organic
[28:12.680 --> 28:16.760]  no-till living soil you know what I'm talking about you organic hippies if
[28:16.760 --> 28:21.280]  you're running that sort of stuff then I do encourage you do your your crazy
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.120]  sprays if you're not familiar with that and you're not running that type of grow
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.440]  I do not encourage it I would not do that that will set yourself up for
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.640]  problems where are we when you follow your spray you're going to increase the
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.200]  humidity of your room that may not be the best idea maybe have your exhaust
[28:38.200 --> 28:42.640]  fans and dehumidifier on you're going to have to clean your dehumidifier more
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.160]  often if you're full you're feeding because some of that funky shit will
[28:46.160 --> 28:50.240]  end up in the air those nutrients will end up in your dehumidifier filter clean
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.120]  that where are we what am I going for mix well when you're mixing up your
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.120]  foliar feed I've said it shake the shit out of that spray or just shake it make
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.320]  sure it's all mixed up in there you don't want to feed the the bottom stuff
[29:03.320 --> 29:06.400]  is heavier the cow mag will be at the bottom the nitrogen will be up at the
[29:06.400 --> 29:11.520]  top you don't want to feed like that mix it up really well also use some sort of
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.160]  a wetting agent when you are applying foliar feeds and or pesticides something
[29:16.160 --> 29:20.400]  like cocoa wet works really well wet Betty works just fine if you want to use
[29:20.400 --> 29:24.040]  that brand or a couple of drops of organic dish soap would do the same
[29:24.040 --> 29:27.760]  thing what this does is this makes it spread and stick to your leaves a little
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.680]  bit better the longer the stuff spreads and sticks to your leaves the more
[29:31.680 --> 29:34.840]  available it is it won't just run off and drip onto the floor that way you
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.200]  didn't just foliar feed the floor and waste all your product it's stuck to the
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.600]  plants I feel like I've got something else I wanted to say on that I don't
[29:42.600 --> 29:47.240]  know where it went okay I'm just gonna act like I remembered what I was saying
[29:47.240 --> 29:52.520]  because I really don't you're gonna make small bubbles so I recommend that you
[29:52.520 --> 29:57.480]  wear protective equipment always wear personal protective equipment always
[29:57.480 --> 30:01.120]  absolutely wear goggles if you're gonna use a paint sprayer if you're gonna use
[30:01.120 --> 30:05.160]  a sprayer put some sort of mask on I recommend some sort of a respirator
[30:05.160 --> 30:09.800]  especially with the paint sprayer you're creating micro bubbles of what
[30:09.800 --> 30:14.080]  are we spraying phosphorus potassium cow mag do you want to breathe in little
[30:14.080 --> 30:18.080]  bubbles of cow mag I don't know that that's really good for any part of your
[30:18.080 --> 30:23.520]  body so please wear personal protective equipment when spraying anything if
[30:23.520 --> 30:26.880]  you're spraying a pesticide if you're spraying a boost if you're just spraying
[30:26.880 --> 30:30.960]  water put on some personal protective equipment I know that sounds silly we
[30:30.960 --> 30:33.680]  don't want to breathe in these bubbles you guys you don't want to breathe that
[30:33.800 --> 30:37.800]  stuff in we smoke this cannabis we want to keep our lungs healthy we smoke the
[30:37.800 --> 30:43.320]  dabs your lungs are important dude let's do what we can to protect those
[30:43.320 --> 30:49.840]  pesticides and foliar feeds there is nothing wrong with mixing a foliar feed
[30:49.840 --> 30:53.880]  in with the pesticide if you were applying a routine pesticide you can add
[30:53.880 --> 30:59.560]  push to that pesticide application it says on the bottle of push do not mix
[30:59.560 --> 31:03.360]  with any other products do not mix with pesticides guess what I've done it a lot
[31:03.360 --> 31:06.840]  of times I've done it countless times I've done it with a lot of different
[31:06.840 --> 31:10.800]  nutrients and I never see any adverse reactions I kind of feel like it's
[31:10.800 --> 31:14.240]  drinking it's kind of like drinking vodka and orange juice one of them is
[31:14.240 --> 31:17.760]  gonna fucking ruin my body but at the other time I got so much vitamin C that
[31:17.760 --> 31:21.520]  I feel good about it I don't really drink vodka and orange juice but I feel
[31:21.520 --> 31:24.400]  like if you're gonna spray a pesticide to the plant that's gonna kind of beat
[31:24.400 --> 31:28.200]  up the plant a little bit stress that plan out why not add some push to it and
[31:28.200 --> 31:31.520]  then you can kind of negate the damage give it a boost maybe we'll level out
[31:31.520 --> 31:35.520]  and get rid of the bugs boost the plants all at the same time so you can
[31:35.520 --> 31:40.720]  apply both at the same time many people will tell you to pH your foliar feed
[31:40.720 --> 31:45.800]  research that one you don't want acid rain on our plants that doesn't sound
[31:45.800 --> 31:51.040]  like any fun for anybody always have a strategy always have a strategy I've
[31:51.040 --> 31:54.720]  written that down a couple of times why are you foliar feeding don't just go in
[31:54.720 --> 31:58.640]  there and willy-nilly start spraying shit around have a strategy what are you
[31:58.640 --> 32:01.800]  spraying for what is your goal are you trying to give them a boost are you
[32:01.800 --> 32:04.560]  trying to correct something are you trying to prevent something if it's a
[32:04.560 --> 32:10.160]  pesticide spray if it's a foliar feed always have a strategy then as soon as
[32:10.160 --> 32:15.400]  you are done spraying write down exactly what you sprayed what was in the mix how
[32:15.400 --> 32:19.520]  much of it was in the mix how many gallons were applied which plants were
[32:19.520 --> 32:23.120]  applied did you only spray the veg did you only spray the flower did you only
[32:23.120 --> 32:27.440]  spray the large veg the small veg the pre flower write down everything you
[32:27.440 --> 32:32.000]  sprayed write down the time and date if you used a pesticide write down the re
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  entry time so you know when you can go back in there this should be standard
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.880]  for every grow this is required by law in a commercial grow environment by law
[32:41.880 --> 32:45.760]  by Department of Agriculture law by Department of Health law and I'm pretty
[32:45.760 --> 32:48.080]  sure there's some other people that would probably whip your ass and give
[32:48.080 --> 32:52.080]  you a ticket if you didn't do it you were required to keep documentation of
[32:52.080 --> 32:56.000]  everything that was sprayed on those plants every pesticide application is
[32:56.320 --> 33:00.240]  required to be documented by law and I think you have to keep it in a folder
[33:00.240 --> 33:04.640]  for two to three years so we use a Department of Agriculture approved
[33:04.640 --> 33:08.400]  spreadsheet we write down everything that was fucking sprayed the date the
[33:08.400 --> 33:13.600]  time the amount the product there is a number a an EPA number on the bottle
[33:13.600 --> 33:17.560]  that we have to include on that spreadsheet your initials your MED
[33:17.560 --> 33:21.160]  badge number your Department of Agriculture certification number what
[33:21.160 --> 33:25.360]  time it was sprayed what time the spring ended and the reentry interval all of
[33:25.360 --> 33:29.280]  that is required to be written on a sheet every time we spray something in
[33:29.280 --> 33:33.440]  any grow a pesticide not a booster I could spray push and not have to write
[33:33.440 --> 33:36.520]  it down but if I put a pesticide in there I would have to write that down
[33:36.520 --> 33:41.560]  for the Department of Agriculture anything I spray I write down in my own
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.240]  personal grow log that way if something goes wrong or if something goes right I
[33:46.240 --> 33:50.280]  can look back and say what the fuck happened in here if I spray something
[33:50.280 --> 33:53.440]  today and in like three or four days I walk in there and the plants look
[33:53.440 --> 33:56.680]  fucking decrepit I can look back in my notes and I can say everything that I
[33:56.680 --> 34:01.360]  fed was normal it was the new feed I fed them I sprayed them this fucking thing
[34:01.360 --> 34:06.120]  and they went ape shit or I can say why do my plants look happy those buds have
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.440]  never been beefier the plants have never prayed like that what did I do I can
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.760]  look back and say oh it's this new product I sprayed that every three days
[34:12.760 --> 34:17.160]  instead of every five days this time and the plants fucking loved it so keep good
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.280]  notes on what you're doing you can always adjust and change your strategy
[34:21.280 --> 34:24.360]  based on your research that is a scientific method that's building a
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.640]  relationship with your plants that's understanding the products you're using
[34:27.640 --> 34:33.080]  that is becoming a solid grower so do that stuff don't spray big chunky buds
[34:33.080 --> 34:38.400]  if the buds are getting big you may want to stop spraying I usually quit spraying
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.640]  around day 21 I may hit them with one final pesticide spray one final booster
[34:43.640 --> 34:49.800]  spray at day 21 just to get them going then I avoid spraying if at all possible
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.120]  understand that it does rain outside you've got chunky buds outside if you're
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.320]  growing outdoors the water the rain the mist the fog are going to hit those
[34:57.320 --> 35:02.000]  plants yes there's a lot of airflow and air moving out there but the plants are
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.960]  resilient to moisture if you do run into problems if you do have issues there are
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.960]  products that you can apply early in flower as buds are developing but be
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.280]  very careful be very specific do your research and understand what you are
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.800]  applying to these plants unless it is necessary please don't spray them keep
[35:19.800 --> 35:23.520]  in mind I said that they are resilient they are resistant the trichomes do work
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.240]  to keep the water off the plants but they also work like a sponge if you're
[35:27.240 --> 35:31.920]  gonna spray them just mist them get the the booster or the pesticide or the
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.400]  mildew remover whatever you have to put on there get that on there but don't
[35:35.400 --> 35:39.280]  saturate those buds we don't want to wet up the spongy buds cause ourselves more
[35:39.280 --> 35:42.680]  problems that's when you've got to weigh your options do I want to spray them or
[35:42.680 --> 35:45.680]  do I just want to accept the problem I've got that's when you've got thinking
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.960]  to do so foliar feeding is a really good way to provide specific nutrients to our
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.360]  plants without over watering or causing a lockout it is a good way to chase a
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.000]  problem if you see a nitrogen deficiency you can absolutely mix up some of your
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.560]  vegetative nutrients give it a foliar feed maybe apply it two or three days
[36:03.560 --> 36:07.440]  apart do it two or three times you'll absolutely see results if you need to go
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.720]  harder go harder like I said earlier start your foliar feed light use less
[36:12.720 --> 36:17.080]  than you think you need and increase you can't unfeed it but you can feed it more
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.080]  it's already deficient so feed it more if you need to but don't burn it by
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.800]  trying to fix it all in one spray it's like painting a couple of light coats
[36:24.800 --> 36:28.840]  may work better than one thick coat and it works great because you don't have to
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.680]  keep watering in you've already watered the roots are doing their thing moving
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.040]  the nutrients around now you got to just get that cow mag where it needs to be by
[36:36.080 --> 36:42.440]  spraying it so I think that is my my foliar feed episode I hope I answered
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.160]  your question I hope I gave you some useful information thank you for the
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.160]  great email if you've got any more questions I would love to hear from you
