[00:03.260 --> 00:19.240]  All right, here we go.
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.880]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.880 --> 00:27.680]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 686 of the Grow From Your
[00:27.680 --> 00:29.380]  Heart Podcast.
[00:29.380 --> 00:33.240]  In this episode, we're going to talk about Terps, but before we get to that part of the
[00:34.240 --> 00:38.640]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:38.640 --> 00:40.560]  on Patreon.
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.520]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.360]  Pac Northwest Dan.
[00:46.360 --> 00:48.620]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Ned Denver.
[00:48.620 --> 00:49.920]  Let's send a fist bump to Smoke.
[00:49.920 --> 00:50.920]  What?
[00:50.920 --> 00:54.440]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to two Canadian supporters.
[00:54.440 --> 00:57.200]  Let's send a fist bump to Tonto and Tartan Mike.
[00:57.200 --> 00:59.760]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Tropic Gardens.
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.560]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to a good friend and a longtime supporter,
[01:03.560 --> 01:05.500]  my friend Girls Grow Too.
[01:05.500 --> 01:09.040]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Mr. Mean Green and Big Sexy Dank.
[01:09.040 --> 01:11.280]  Let's send a fist bump to the new old guy.
[01:11.280 --> 01:15.200]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:15.200 --> 01:17.160]  to Yannick Bucci.
[01:17.160 --> 01:22.040]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:22.040 --> 01:25.640]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:25.640 --> 01:32.160]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:32.160 --> 01:34.720]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.740]  And you know, I do include that link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:38.740 --> 01:42.240]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:42.240 --> 01:45.720]  Before we get to the main topic of this podcast, I do have a couple of things I'd like to remind
[01:45.720 --> 01:47.080]  you of and talk about.
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.160]  Of course, the first order of business is the Black Friday sale.
[01:51.160 --> 01:52.160]  That's right.
[01:52.160 --> 01:55.240]  There is a Black Friday sale coming up on the iRegenetics web store.
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.560]  If you are looking for t-shirts, grinders, rolling trays and that sort of stuff, I will
[01:59.560 --> 02:02.280]  be doing a Black Friday Cyber Monday sale.
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.560]  The best way to stay updated on that sale is to join the newsletter.
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.780]  If you go to the website iRegenetics.com, there's a spot for you to type in your email
[02:09.780 --> 02:11.680]  address and join the newsletter.
[02:11.680 --> 02:12.840]  That will get you signed up.
[02:12.840 --> 02:16.600]  When I do post that sale, you will get updated, you will get a link, you will get all the
[02:16.600 --> 02:18.060]  information you need.
[02:18.060 --> 02:20.320]  Of course, there is a sale going on for the patrons.
[02:20.320 --> 02:21.720]  They got the notification first.
[02:21.720 --> 02:23.160]  They got a coupon code.
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.240]  Also, check out patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart to get early access to
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.080]  the Black Friday sale.
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.840]  The next thing I want to talk about is if you are sending seeds to somebody anywhere,
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.840]  if they are going in the mail and they are traveling in the mail, please put those seeds
[02:38.840 --> 02:41.520]  in some sort of protective container.
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.640]  You would not believe how many people allegedly, possibly, hypothetically, maybe send me seeds
[02:47.640 --> 02:51.400]  to test or just as samples or just as gifts.
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.760]  Ten out of ten times, they put those seeds in just some shitty baggy, some lackluster
[02:55.760 --> 02:58.400]  packaging and when they get here, they're crushed.
[02:58.400 --> 03:01.200]  A lot of the mail we get goes through rollers.
[03:01.200 --> 03:03.760]  I don't know exactly the process at the post office.
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.360]  I haven't gone back there and had a tour, but I've seen videos.
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.520]  I know a little bit of how it works.
[03:07.520 --> 03:09.800]  A lot of the packages go through two rollers.
[03:09.800 --> 03:12.080]  They just get moved down by little rollers.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.080]  It looks like two rolling pins.
[03:13.080 --> 03:16.200]  When your seeds go through those, they get flattened and squished.
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.280]  If you're going to send anybody seeds, please put them in some sort of protective container,
[03:21.280 --> 03:22.880]  little containers are very affordable.
[03:22.880 --> 03:25.800]  If you're going to send a lot of seeds, just order a couple of packages.
[03:25.800 --> 03:28.080]  They're not that expensive or make something.
[03:28.080 --> 03:31.720]  If you don't want to make a package, use a priority mailbox.
[03:31.720 --> 03:32.720]  They're boxes.
[03:32.720 --> 03:33.720]  They won't get crushed.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.960]  Please, let's protect these seeds.
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.520]  I love getting gifts, but it's really heartbreaking to open up my gift and it's just a baggy of
[03:40.520 --> 03:42.600]  seed dust with the label on it.
[03:42.600 --> 03:45.400]  It says, hey, these would have been amazing fucking seeds.
[03:45.400 --> 03:47.440]  It's this crossed to this, which is very rare.
[03:47.440 --> 03:48.560]  Nobody else has it.
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.760]  Here's all of the seeds I made.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.360]  You can have them and guess what?
[03:51.360 --> 03:52.360]  They're all crushed.
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.720]  They're all dust.
[03:53.720 --> 03:54.720]  That's heartbreaking.
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.160]  You wouldn't believe how many times I've opened up packages and found crushed seeds.
[03:59.160 --> 04:03.480]  Any seed that I send out, any seed that allegedly comes from me or gets shipped in any way is
[04:03.480 --> 04:05.540]  put into a protective container.
[04:05.540 --> 04:07.240]  It doesn't cost that much.
[04:07.240 --> 04:08.240]  Just a little bit of thought.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.240]  It shows that you care.
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.400]  It shows that you're thinking about the person you're either selling, sharing, giving to.
[04:13.400 --> 04:14.400]  Just think about that.
[04:14.400 --> 04:15.400]  Think about the seeds.
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.560]  We put a lot of time, effort, and energy, money, thought into this.
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.240]  Let's just protect the product.
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.240]  It doesn't take that much.
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.240]  All right.
[04:22.240 --> 04:24.200]  We will quit rambling about protecting the seeds.
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.600]  I just think it's really important, especially as a seed vendor, a seed retailer.
[04:27.600 --> 04:30.000]  I get a lot of seeds that are poorly packaged.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  Let's package them up.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  All right.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  Let's jump into this email.
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.680]  This one came from our friend.
[04:34.680 --> 04:35.920]  It doesn't have a name on it.
[04:35.920 --> 04:38.840]  If you wanted your name said on the show, I do apologize.
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.280]  If you want a shout out, send me a message.
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.920]  We'll give you a shout out.
[04:41.920 --> 04:43.240]  It goes a lot like this.
[04:43.240 --> 04:44.640]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.400]  I enjoy your podcast and your growing.
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.600]  And growing your wares.
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  I appreciate that.
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.600]  Thank you.
[04:50.600 --> 04:55.560]  It says, I was wondering if you could consider a podcast about terpenes and the effects that
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.840]  the presence, absence, or mixtures of the various terpenes in a plant are known to have.
[05:00.840 --> 05:03.680]  That is a very good question, a very good topic.
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.140]  We're going to jump into that.
[05:05.140 --> 05:08.520]  It says, most strains seem to have a number of terps.
[05:08.520 --> 05:14.200]  Yes, there's a combination in most strains, but it's pretty clear that the high limonene
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.640]  in a product gives me a bit of an edgy, heart racy effect as Lemon Sunrise demonstrates.
[05:19.640 --> 05:23.160]  Yes, that limonene buzz is what I really enjoy.
[05:23.160 --> 05:24.960]  I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[05:24.960 --> 05:26.920]  I'm not sure how much I've talked about this on the show.
[05:26.920 --> 05:28.840]  I'm not sure how many episodes you have listened to.
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.560]  I'll give you a brief update.
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.560]  In 2015, I suffered a traumatic brain injury.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.480]  I hit my head, not a big deal.
[05:35.480 --> 05:36.560]  I hit my head one time.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.120]  I was knocked unconscious.
[05:38.120 --> 05:40.040]  Then while I was out, I fell down the stairs.
[05:40.040 --> 05:44.160]  On my way down the stairs, I smacked the back of my head on the stairs several times.
[05:45.120 --> 05:47.920]  Things were really not good for my brain and for my body.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.000]  My brain and body were not sending the right signals.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.440]  I would forget that I was hungry.
[05:52.440 --> 05:54.080]  I would go two days without eating.
[05:54.080 --> 05:55.560]  My friends would hear my stomach grumble.
[05:55.560 --> 05:57.040]  They'd say, hey bro, are you hungry?
[05:57.040 --> 05:58.800]  I'd say, I don't know, maybe.
[05:58.800 --> 05:59.800]  They'd give me food.
[05:59.800 --> 06:03.560]  I would eat like a fucking savage, like I'd been a hostage for a week.
[06:03.560 --> 06:04.800]  I wasn't getting the right signals.
[06:04.800 --> 06:07.240]  I didn't know that I was hot and cold the right way.
[06:07.240 --> 06:09.840]  I would get really thirsty and not realize it.
[06:09.840 --> 06:13.000]  My lips and teeth and tongue would be all stuck together.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.360]  My friends would be like, bro, you look like Fire Marshal Bill over there.
[06:15.360 --> 06:16.360]  Drink some water.
[06:16.360 --> 06:18.320]  I'd be like, oh, I didn't even realize I was thirsty.
[06:18.320 --> 06:21.960]  I was having major problems with my traumatic brain injury.
[06:21.960 --> 06:26.680]  As I started to heal and come back around, I noticed that I had sort of a skip.
[06:26.680 --> 06:29.280]  If you're from the 90s, you remember we used to have CDs.
[06:29.280 --> 06:31.920]  We used to listen to our music on CDs.
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.120]  Sometimes those CDs would get a skip or a scratch on them.
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.240]  You would play it and it would just have a little skip or a little scratch in the same
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.480]  spot every time.
[06:39.480 --> 06:43.680]  You'd be listening to a song and it would be boom, chick, boom, chick, skip, boom, chick,
[06:43.680 --> 06:44.680]  boom, chick.
[06:44.680 --> 06:45.760]  It would just go right back to the song.
[06:45.760 --> 06:49.000]  You would almost remember that there's a skip in that one part of the song on your CD.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.560]  It would just be embedded in your memory as part of the song.
[06:52.560 --> 06:55.240]  Sometimes I experience that type of a skip in my brain.
[06:55.240 --> 06:58.600]  I'll feel like that there's just something skip, something skip, something is skipping
[06:58.600 --> 06:59.600]  in my brain.
[06:59.600 --> 07:00.880]  You got to kind of like give it a Fonzie.
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.480]  You just got to nudge it and then it'll jump right back in and get going again.
[07:04.480 --> 07:11.080]  I've noticed that high limonene flowers and concentrates will kind of help with that skip.
[07:11.080 --> 07:14.960]  I feel like it cleans off the scratch on my record or my CD or it takes off whatever was
[07:14.960 --> 07:17.880]  in the way and it makes me flow a little bit better.
[07:17.880 --> 07:20.160]  It takes out the ticks and the skips.
[07:20.160 --> 07:26.120]  So I absolutely understand that limonene can be very beneficial medicinally to a lot of
[07:26.120 --> 07:27.120]  people.
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.740]  It will give you that panicky, racy sort of a buzz.
[07:29.740 --> 07:32.260]  I enjoy that panicky, racy sort of a buzz.
[07:32.260 --> 07:37.580]  It kind of fixes me and then also I get high from it and it makes me forget that I've got
[07:37.580 --> 07:38.580]  a brain injury.
[07:38.580 --> 07:40.380]  So that's how limonene gets to me.
[07:40.380 --> 07:42.160]  It's going to get to people.
[07:42.160 --> 07:45.060]  Everybody is going to be affected differently by terpenes.
[07:45.060 --> 07:48.580]  That's something that is later in my notes, but let me, let me jump to that part.
[07:48.580 --> 07:53.500]  Now, terpenes are going to affect people differently just like any other medicine does, just like
[07:53.500 --> 07:55.700]  brain chemistry and body chemistry.
[07:55.700 --> 07:59.360]  I know some people that can drink four cups of coffee and act normal.
[07:59.360 --> 08:03.600]  If I drink one cup of coffee, I act like Beavis and I spin around for about 30 minutes
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.680]  and then I take a big poop in a nap and I got to sleep after that.
[08:06.680 --> 08:09.720]  It's just body chemistry, brain chemistry, the way that things affect us.
[08:09.720 --> 08:15.200]  So my experience with terpenes may be different than a lot of other people's experience with
[08:15.200 --> 08:16.320]  terpenes.
[08:16.320 --> 08:21.120]  It goes on to say, other than the limonene, it says, and any significant amount of mercine
[08:21.120 --> 08:22.960]  will soon render me unconscious.
[08:22.960 --> 08:24.320]  Yes, that is very common.
[08:24.320 --> 08:28.160]  There are a couple of terps that send you up and also there are a few terps that will
[08:28.160 --> 08:30.640]  send you down and mellow you out.
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.040]  In my opinion, in my experience, let me make a disclaimer.
[08:34.040 --> 08:37.240]  Here is something that I wanted to make sure to include in this.
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.600]  I am not qualified to give a scientific talk about terpenes.
[08:41.600 --> 08:42.800]  I don't want to fake it.
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.280]  I don't want to bullshit you.
[08:44.280 --> 08:45.560]  I am not qualified.
[08:45.560 --> 08:48.160]  I don't know about the scientific part of terps.
[08:48.160 --> 08:55.400]  What I do know is how aromas and flavors and cannabis benefit me and how I select my cannabis
[08:55.400 --> 09:01.560]  and my concentrates by aroma because I know that my nose knows and we're going to talk
[09:01.560 --> 09:02.560]  about that.
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.600]  But I want to make it clear that I don't have any sort of science education, any degree,
[09:07.600 --> 09:08.600]  any of that.
[09:08.600 --> 09:11.240]  Everything I'm talking about is from my personal experience.
[09:11.240 --> 09:13.840]  I can't tell you the compounds of terpenes.
[09:13.840 --> 09:15.480]  I can't tell you what makes a terpene.
[09:15.480 --> 09:16.960]  I don't know that part.
[09:16.960 --> 09:20.600]  I'm going to be completely honest with you that I don't have that education.
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.920]  I'm going to talk about what I do know and explain it the way that I do know it.
[09:25.920 --> 09:29.800]  Here's something I think is my experience.
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.600]  When I smoke, I think that the cannabinoid is, let's say it's a firework.
[09:35.600 --> 09:38.000]  Let's say that smoking is fireworks.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.360]  When I take a dab, the THC is how high I'm going to shoot into the sky.
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.960]  I take a dab and if there's low amounts of THC, I'm only going to lift off so high.
[09:48.080 --> 09:51.240]  If there's high amounts of THC, we're going real high.
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.200]  That's kind of my fuel, my rocket power in my dab or in my smoke is the cannabinoid,
[09:56.200 --> 09:57.200]  the THC.
[09:57.200 --> 10:03.040]  Now, I think that the terpenes are the colors of my fireworks.
[10:03.040 --> 10:04.760]  Are my fireworks going to be green?
[10:04.760 --> 10:05.760]  Are they going to be purple?
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.400]  Are they going to be red?
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.280]  Those colors are the effects, in my opinion.
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.280]  Do I get the munchies?
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.280]  Do I get the giggles?
[10:13.280 --> 10:14.280]  Do I get paranoid?
[10:14.280 --> 10:15.600]  Do I get pain relief?
[10:15.600 --> 10:17.320]  Do I get a panic attack?
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.440]  That's what the terpenes brings to my smoke, to my concentrate.
[10:22.440 --> 10:24.680]  The THC, that shoots me up.
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.720]  The terpenes are the type of buzz that I get.
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.440]  Sometimes you get the giggles, right?
[10:29.440 --> 10:31.000]  Sometimes you get paranoid as fuck.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.040]  I think that's all about the terpenes.
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.080]  I think that we think too much about indica and sativa and we don't focus enough on the
[10:38.080 --> 10:39.080]  terpenes.
[10:39.080 --> 10:42.720]  Now, I know that I just basically implied that we should focus more on terpenes when
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.520]  we are selecting our products, but at the same time, I don't know a lot about terpenes.
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.800]  I haven't bothered to learn what every terpene smells like, what the effects and qualities
[10:51.800 --> 10:57.760]  of every terpene are, because when I'm talking to people, most of the people I talk to don't
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.380]  speak terpenese.
[10:59.380 --> 11:01.400]  They speak normal languages.
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.500]  I can't say, hey, this product really smells like linolool or this product really smells
[11:05.500 --> 11:06.500]  like mercine.
[11:06.500 --> 11:08.160]  Most people are going to have to Google that.
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.920]  I'm not doing them any good.
[11:09.920 --> 11:12.160]  Then they're going to go to Google and they're going to say, oh, linolool.
[11:12.600 --> 11:14.920]  That probably smells like lavender, citrus, and laurel.
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.840]  I should have just gotten right to the point and said, this herb smells like lavender and
[11:18.840 --> 11:19.840]  citrus.
[11:19.840 --> 11:20.840]  That would have been more beneficial.
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.080]  So, I love terps and I love talking about terps, but I oftentimes skip all of that technical
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.200]  stuff because how many people out there want to hear, oh, it smells like linolool and it
[11:31.200 --> 11:33.680]  smells like this percent of linolool and this much mercine.
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.620]  They want me to say it smells like chocolate or it smells like gas.
[11:37.620 --> 11:40.300]  Everybody out there knows what chocolate and gas smells like.
[11:40.300 --> 11:43.180]  You get memories in your mouth and in your brain and in your nose.
[11:43.180 --> 11:44.980]  When I say chocolate, you go, hmm, chocolate.
[11:44.980 --> 11:48.500]  You can smell different types of chocolate and different textures of chocolate.
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.500]  That gives me options.
[11:49.500 --> 11:53.340]  If I say linolool, you got to Google it and figure out what that even is.
[11:53.340 --> 11:57.700]  Honestly, I've never had a machine come back and say, hey, can I get more of that high
[11:57.700 --> 11:59.100]  linolool product?
[11:59.100 --> 12:01.860]  I've had people say, hey, do you have any more of that herb that smelled like cherries
[12:01.860 --> 12:02.860]  and feet?
[12:02.860 --> 12:08.280]  So, I think it's much more just practical for me to talk in terms of flavors and aromas
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.400]  that are familiar instead of being technical about linolool, carofeline, and words like
[12:13.400 --> 12:14.400]  that.
[12:14.400 --> 12:15.400]  It does sound cool.
[12:15.400 --> 12:17.360]  It makes me look pro, but I lose a lot of people.
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.880]  All of those fancy terpene descriptions are great for the medical industry, but my nose
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.400]  doesn't care what linolool, mercine, any of that stuff is.
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.800]  My nose goes, oh, that smells good.
[12:28.800 --> 12:30.240]  I want to smoke that.
[12:30.240 --> 12:35.040]  And I think that there's something in us just primally that knows what our body needs.
[12:35.040 --> 12:37.000]  That's why poop stinks.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.760]  That's why oranges smell good.
[12:38.760 --> 12:40.000]  You're not supposed to eat poop.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.840]  So, nature, whatever you believe in, nature, God, Jah, sun, whoever you want to talk about,
[12:45.840 --> 12:48.720]  whatever you believe in made poop stink so that we don't eat it.
[12:48.720 --> 12:49.720]  That is waste.
[12:49.720 --> 12:50.720]  You're not supposed to put that in.
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.160]  You smell it from far away.
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.520]  The less healthy it is, the worse it stinks.
[12:54.520 --> 12:55.960]  You go, god, that shit smells so bad.
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.480]  I can smell it from 10 feet away.
[12:57.480 --> 12:58.760]  I don't even want to go over there.
[12:58.760 --> 12:59.760]  You're not going to eat it.
[12:59.760 --> 13:00.840]  You're not going to consume it.
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.240]  When you walk through an orange grove, you go, ooh, unless you're allergic to oranges.
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.320]  I do know people that are deathly allergic to oranges.
[13:06.640 --> 13:07.920]  I apologize for this.
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.520]  But if you're into oranges, you walk through the orange grove, you go, that smells so good.
[13:12.520 --> 13:14.800]  And you just want to eat them because oranges are good for you.
[13:14.800 --> 13:16.320]  They got some sugar in there.
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.320]  They taste good.
[13:17.320 --> 13:19.120]  They got vitamin C in there.
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.120]  Oranges are beneficial.
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.120]  They give you some vitamins.
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.120]  So, they smell good.
[13:22.120 --> 13:23.120]  Your body wants it.
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.040]  That's why when you smell good food, your mouth starts watering.
[13:26.040 --> 13:27.040]  You know.
[13:27.040 --> 13:28.800]  That's why when you smell poop, you want to go away.
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.440]  I think that the terps and cannabis do the same thing to us.
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.560]  When the bud tender opens a jar, your brain doesn't go, ooh, linalool, murcine, carofeline.
[13:37.560 --> 13:39.440]  Your brain doesn't do that.
[13:39.440 --> 13:40.440]  Some of you do.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.440]  Some of you nerds out there.
[13:41.440 --> 13:42.440]  And I love you nerds for it.
[13:42.440 --> 13:43.440]  No offense.
[13:43.440 --> 13:45.200]  There's always categories of nerds in the weed industry.
[13:45.200 --> 13:48.040]  But most people are going to go, I don't like that.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.920]  Ooh, I really like that.
[13:49.920 --> 13:50.920]  That's okay.
[13:50.920 --> 13:51.920]  That's how your brain is going to respond.
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.640]  And then you're going to go, hmm, berries.
[13:53.640 --> 13:54.940]  I want some of that.
[13:54.940 --> 13:58.760]  That's most likely the one that is going to give you the effects that you need.
[13:58.760 --> 14:00.920]  The one that you're going to enjoy the most.
[14:00.920 --> 14:01.920]  So I've said it before.
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.160]  I've actually got a full podcast that is titled follow your nose because I love the machines.
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.160]  I love the readouts.
[14:08.160 --> 14:11.120]  I love the graphs, but your nose knows what you need.
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.200]  Your nose is the boss.
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.640]  My nose and your nose are different because your body chemistry, my body chemistry are
[14:17.640 --> 14:18.640]  different.
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.320]  Our needs might be different.
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.080]  Our recreational and medical needs for cannabis might be different.
[14:24.080 --> 14:25.080]  I like stuff.
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.720]  Like I said earlier, I like to smoke myself into a panic attack.
[14:28.720 --> 14:31.960]  I have a lot of friends that like to smoke themselves into a coma.
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.320]  It's all about what you're desiring for the buzz.
[14:34.320 --> 14:35.320]  There is more to this message.
[14:35.320 --> 14:37.080]  I got quite rambly.
[14:37.080 --> 14:38.080]  Let me catch up on this.
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.800]  It says, I'm not asking for a biochemistry lesson or anything, just your own observations.
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.440]  That's great because honestly, like I said before, I don't have the qualifications to
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.080]  give you the actual chemistry.
[14:48.080 --> 14:54.680]  I just know through experience that the cannabinoids seem to make me go up and the terpenes seem
[14:54.680 --> 14:58.120]  to dictate the color and direction of my buzz.
[14:58.120 --> 15:00.320]  That is the best way I can describe that.
[15:00.320 --> 15:04.200]  I do have a few more notes here I want to make sure that I cover.
[15:04.200 --> 15:06.320]  Follow your nose is one of the most important parts.
[15:06.320 --> 15:08.360]  All right, there is one last part to this email.
[15:08.360 --> 15:09.360]  It goes on.
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.600]  It says, again, thanks for the genetics and the podcast.
[15:11.600 --> 15:13.860]  I look forward to my next seed run.
[15:13.860 --> 15:17.880]  It seems like a guy can't grow out a pack of seeds fathered by King Solomon without
[15:17.880 --> 15:20.760]  finding at least one keeper.
[15:20.760 --> 15:21.760]  That is awesome.
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.280]  I love hearing that you are finding at least one keeper in every pack of seeds that you
[15:25.280 --> 15:26.280]  run for me.
[15:26.280 --> 15:27.280]  That is a great compliment.
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.440]  Thank you for the great compliment.
[15:28.440 --> 15:31.680]  Also, thank you for the great email and the great question.
