[02:23.300 --> 02:25.300]  Fish is coming to Denver. That's right
[02:25.300 --> 02:30.140]  My favorite band on the planet is fish and they are doing four nights at Dick's sporting goods
[02:30.220 --> 02:34.340]  The giant soccer field and commerce are in. Nah. Yeah commerce city there in Denver, Colorado
[02:35.100 --> 02:36.660]  Commerce city just outside of Denver
[02:36.660 --> 02:37.140]  You know what?

[02:46.940 --> 02:50.380]  I really don't like it when after an event people email me and they say hey, bro
[02:50.380 --> 02:54.380]  I saw you at the fish concerts, but I did not come say hi. Why not dude come say hi

[03:00.380 --> 03:04.580]  That's a general rule. Don't talk to me while fish is playing save it for set break

[03:09.060 --> 03:13.620]  You don't have to say hey, bro. I saw you there and ignored you. That's not cool. I'm a community kind of dude
[03:13.620 --> 03:15.100]  I'm friendly say what's up?
[03:15.100 --> 03:17.740]  I may just may have some seeds in my back pocket

[04:57.160 --> 05:03.260]  I think I'm the only project he's had time to work on getting I redirect going and compliant with the credit card compliance setup
[05:03.520 --> 05:07.400]  Was kind of a challenge so we got that going web dude. Shout out, bro
[05:07.400 --> 05:10.680]  I owe you one. I know already sent you a gift pack, but that took longer than anticipated
[05:10.800 --> 05:15.200]  So I'll you another one bro, let me know what I could do for you. All right, let's move forward
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.780]  I've been rambling for quite some time. The show's getting long already
[05:17.780 --> 05:19.960]  We haven't even talked about the main topic of this podcast
[05:20.440 --> 05:26.680]  The main topic of this show is my new strain or one of my newest strains. It is called John Lemon
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.100]  I'm sure you've seen me post. Maybe you haven't I hope you have seen me post pictures of it to social media
[05:31.480 --> 05:38.480]  Follow me on Instagram. I re underscore genetics. Check me out on cannabis. Once again, I re underscore genetics join the discord
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.120]  I'm all over social media search. I read genetics. You cannot miss me
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.720]  I've been posting pictures lately of a plant that I am calling John
[05:46.320 --> 05:52.600]  Lemon, let's talk about John lemon for just a little bit a quick description. Is that John lemon?
[05:53.360 --> 05:58.800]  Smells like sour skunks and diesel feel the main thing. You're gonna hear me say a lot here is sour
[05:58.920 --> 06:00.920]  This one is stupid sour
[06:01.200 --> 06:06.240]  I'd almost got a lot of names with the word sour or sour in there shout out to my East Coast friends
[06:06.560 --> 06:11.100]  But I don't say sour and there's enough sour out there so I wanted to go with the creative name
[06:11.100 --> 06:13.100]  We will talk about why I got that name
[06:13.440 --> 06:18.040]  The aroma makes my eyes feel itchy. I've always talked about sour diesel
[06:18.640 --> 06:23.160]  It has this weird effect on my eyes the John lemon has that same like I don't know
[06:23.160 --> 06:24.520]  It's almost like an allergy effect
[06:24.520 --> 06:29.280]  But in a good way about like my eyes get I could tell when someone's got some sour diesel or John lemon in the car
[06:29.280 --> 06:31.560]  In the room that makes my eyes get this itch
[06:32.320 --> 06:38.520]  The real deal East Coast sour diesel stinks so bad that I said in the car it stinks so bad you can't hide it
[06:38.680 --> 06:42.520]  You could double bag it you could put it in a jar. You could put it in a bag inside of a jar
[06:42.520 --> 06:47.400]  You got a vacuum seal it or something or we are going to smell it that East Coast sour diesel
[06:47.400 --> 06:50.520]  The real deal diesel is a super fucking stinker
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.580]  You cannot hide that one and then when you do open the bag at a party or in the car
[06:54.680 --> 06:58.720]  Especially everybody knows what you've got right away like bro. He's got the fire and they all come
[06:59.440 --> 07:01.520]  Congregating so you got to be careful if you got that one
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.280]  Keep it double bag to be careful where you open it and you can't even open it in the car
[07:05.280 --> 07:11.040]  You cannot open the real deal sour diesel or the John lemon for that matter in the car because it will stink up the car
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.160]  So bad that it smells like you smoked in there for the next week
[07:14.160 --> 07:18.920]  Even if you don't light it just open the jar give it a smell at your friend smell it close it up
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.200]  That car is now stank. It's broken. It'll never smell the same
[07:22.200 --> 07:27.540]  You got to burn some hippie incense drop some ozium in there vacuum that shit out smoking a cigarette in there
[07:27.540 --> 07:29.760]  It's still gonna stank. It is not gonna work
[07:29.940 --> 07:36.580]  So East Coast sour diesel, it's a super stinky plant a lot of those stink traits definitely come through in this cross
[07:37.260 --> 07:38.260]  Let's see. Where are we?
[07:38.260 --> 07:43.820]  I do have some notes that I try to stay on track because I get quite rambly East Coast sour diesel grows tall with thick
[07:43.820 --> 07:48.300]  Dense buds. I'm talking about the parents of the plants. You're kind of giving you an idea of why I made this
[07:48.820 --> 07:49.500]  Let's see
[07:49.500 --> 07:51.500]  The buzz from sour D is super aggressive
[07:51.660 --> 07:54.900]  When I smoke that one my eyes get super heavy and I get this weird like
[07:55.300 --> 08:01.460]  Tunnel vision isolated sort of a feeling sometime I get of a sort of a heart racing sort of a feeling but it's definitely in
[08:01.460 --> 08:02.740]  My own head
[08:02.740 --> 08:05.220]  Introspective introvert kind of weed. I don't want to talk to people
[08:05.220 --> 08:06.540]  I just want to be left the fuck alone
[08:06.540 --> 08:10.580]  So I'm trying to figure out the meaning of life and a Rubik's Cube all at the same time
[08:10.580 --> 08:15.420]  So that's what that one does now. Let's talk about the lemon skunk mail that I used in this cross
[08:16.420 --> 08:17.220]  first of all
[08:17.220 --> 08:20.540]  I should mention this is not the lemon skunk that I used in
[08:20.900 --> 08:25.980]  Lemon Jeffrey and firefly and all the other lemon stuff that you've heard about in the past
[08:26.340 --> 08:33.660]  This is not the same lemon skunk. That is a lemon skunk female in this situation. I am using a male lemon skunk plant
[08:33.660 --> 08:38.580]  This is a BC lemon skunk. So this has been around for a while from the BC seed company
[08:38.940 --> 08:45.180]  I've got my hands on a great lemon skunk male that does great things. It adds great vigor. It adds great shape
[08:45.180 --> 08:47.740]  It adds great potency and most of all it adds a really amazing
[08:48.420 --> 08:54.220]  Lemon flavor to things you guys know how I like that lemon turp. This one is packed up with lemon
[08:54.220 --> 08:59.100]  It's got a beautiful structure. The node spacing is really nice on this one. My lemon skunk female
[08:59.100 --> 09:03.180]  The node spacing is kind of far. This one's more of a compact structure
[09:03.740 --> 09:09.260]  Compared to that lemon skunk. It's got a giant top flower. It makes really sturdy plants
[09:09.260 --> 09:12.660]  It can hold themselves up that other lemon skunk is kind of floppy and need supports
[09:12.660 --> 09:15.100]  The male is more sturdy more robust
[09:15.100 --> 09:21.440]  I can hold itself up and it makes offspring this lemon skunk makes offspring that reek of lemons and they are
[09:21.620 --> 09:23.780]  Stupid potent so I got the idea
[09:23.780 --> 09:30.380]  why not take the lemon skunk and the sour diesel the East Coast sour diesel and put those together and see what we could come
[09:30.380 --> 09:35.260]  Up with and the results. Let's talk a little bit about the results. No first before we get there
[09:35.260 --> 09:41.340]  Let's talk about why did I name it John lemon? That's next year on the notes. Why did I make it John lemon?
[09:41.860 --> 09:47.100]  Honestly, John lemon was recommended to some by me to me by somebody on social media
[09:47.100 --> 09:51.540]  I don't remember who did that exactly there were so many names given and so many things to keep track of if
[09:51.660 --> 09:53.660]  You recommended it and you think you were first
[09:53.660 --> 09:58.340]  Let me know I'll give you a prize shout out for the great name, but the name is awesome
[09:58.340 --> 10:05.500]  I am honestly not a huge Beatles or John Lennon and definitely not a Yoko Ono fan my buddy Chris in high school
[10:05.540 --> 10:09.560]  Shout out to Chris. I hope you're well brother. He's a huge Beatles fan
[10:09.840 --> 10:13.280]  I'd listen we got to listen to the Beatles all the time in the car with Chris
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.520]  He chose the Beatles Robbie chose Pink Floyd Greg chose the Grateful Dead and I chose fish
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.520]  That's kind of like how we picked our favorite bands
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.920]  Everybody got their own band, but I wasn't the Beatles guy. That was Chris
[10:24.600 --> 10:28.240]  But the Beatles are cool, dude. Don't think I'm saying that I hate the Beatles
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.480]  That's just not the one I would have chose
[10:29.480 --> 10:34.080]  I would have chose the Grateful Dead or fish over the Beatles any day and Pink Floyd's kind of boring to me to be honest
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.380]  With you. I know I'm gonna get hate mail send it have fun in the comment section get it on down there
[10:38.700 --> 10:41.060]  But when somebody said John Lemon
[10:41.060 --> 10:46.220]  I thought it was a great name because we've all seen John Lennon in front of the Statue of Liberty in New York that brought
[10:46.220 --> 10:51.400]  Me to the New York vibes. He's not from New York, but you know, he made it there and then we've got the
[10:51.940 --> 10:55.620]  Lemon flavor brings in the lemon. So it's John Lemon John Lennon
[10:55.620 --> 10:58.380]  It was just a beautiful play on words when I heard it could not resist
[10:58.380 --> 11:00.980]  I tried to resist for a long time, but I kept coming back
[11:00.980 --> 11:04.020]  I have a list of names and I kept going this John Lemon right here
[11:04.020 --> 11:09.080]  That's gonna be the one bro, and it's my decision overall. So I chose John Lemon now
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.060]  Let's segue into talking about flavor and aroma or turps if you will
[11:13.380 --> 11:15.420]  This one's got a lot of great flavor to it
[11:15.420 --> 11:20.740]  You're gonna hear me say the word sour a lot because this one is dominated by sour flavors
[11:20.740 --> 11:24.740]  There's a backup of a backup of lemon flavors. There's a backup of some skunk
[11:24.780 --> 11:28.200]  There's hints of maybe some cat piss some ammonia in there
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.260]  But let's talk about some of the aromas and flavors that will come from this
[11:32.260 --> 11:36.100]  It's going to be mostly sour the BC lemon skunk I use makes everything taste like
[11:36.620 --> 11:41.780]  Strong sour lemons that the lemon skunk on the other plants I use is kind of a softer
[11:42.420 --> 11:44.800]  Lemonade kind of a lemons. This one is more just straight-up
[11:45.220 --> 11:48.220]  non-diluted sour ripe lemons in your face lemons
[11:48.220 --> 11:52.260]  Like if you get that plastic lemon with the juice and squeeze it on your tongue you make that pucker
[11:52.340 --> 11:56.300]  That's this kind of lemon. Mm-hmm. Then the sour diesel adds a
[11:56.900 --> 12:00.260]  Definitely a diesel aroma to it. There's that diesel funk to it
[12:00.260 --> 12:06.900]  Then it also adds sort of a an astringent sort of a cat piss sort of a really sharp aroma
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.980]  Maybe ammonia to it to the mix
[12:09.460 --> 12:11.740]  Most of the phenotypes are very sour
[12:11.740 --> 12:14.500]  Some of the other phenotypes are going to have a little bit of lemon
[12:14.500 --> 12:19.580]  Some are gonna have some diesel some plants will even have a little bit of fuel and skunk turps to them
[12:19.580 --> 12:26.140]  You'll get a little bit of cat piss and ammonia in some but you're mainly going to get sour straight sour and lemons
[12:26.140 --> 12:32.700]  But you're mostly gonna get sour sour fuel sour ammonia, maybe some sour cat piss. It sounds disgusting
[12:32.700 --> 12:34.020]  But if you're a cannabis smoker
[12:34.020 --> 12:39.900]  You know that that sour diesel cat piss aroma with lemons mixed into it is going to be amazing
[12:39.900 --> 12:43.040]  And you know, the buzz will be high every time you smoke something like that
[12:43.040 --> 12:49.060]  The buzz is just straight to the brain. My eyes go crazy. I get kind of anxious. My heart starts racing the armpits get sweaty
[12:49.140 --> 12:50.860]  That's what I love when I smoke
[12:50.860 --> 12:56.400]  So now let's talk about the buzz a lot of times I feel like this one goes right to the face right to the head
[12:56.400 --> 13:01.540]  It's like oh gosh when I smoke it my eyes go. Oh, there it was. They get all droopy. My face gets warm
[13:01.540 --> 13:07.000]  I feel like I'm hot. I feel like I got my temperature raises the pits get sweaty the heart starts racing
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.780]  I can't remember where I put my sunglasses, but I'm probably wearing them
[13:10.780 --> 13:16.520]  I can't figure out where I put my phone, but I'm probably playing with my phone and can't find it
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.660]  That's the kind of buzz that the John lemon gives to me
[13:20.720 --> 13:26.480]  All right, we've talked a lot about the smoking effects. Most of you here are here to grow this plant
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.900]  So let's talk about the growing characteristics of John
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.040]  Lemon, most of the things I breed take a little bit to flower
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.280]  I would recommend letting these go for about 70 days. Maybe a little bit longer
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.620]  I say 10 weeks is average and standard for this plant. There may be some shorter
[13:43.620 --> 13:48.060]  There definitely may be some longer most of the best phenotypes finish around 10 weeks
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.300]  The plants that take a little bit longer are definitely the lemon skunk leaners and they definitely get super potent and super lemony
[13:55.300 --> 13:58.520]  But I don't want all that lemon. I want more of the sour in there
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.320]  I prefer the 10 weekers if you want to play with those longer finishers. I encourage you to do that
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.120]  Expect tall plants. These plants will triple in size before they are finished
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.940]  That's right triple if your grow space is only six feet tall start flowering around two feet
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.760]  Save some space for the light. Also that may mess you up
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.160]  The lemon skunk phenotype will get tall quickly and it gets taller and it's a little bit thinner
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.460]  The sour diesel phenotype will spread out a little bit more and knock it as tall as quickly
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.860]  You'll notice it does more branching more spreading out more lateral growth instead of just straight going straight up
[14:34.340 --> 14:40.340]  All those long arms do fill in with fat colas on both phenotypes if you don't clean them up too much a lot of us
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.680]  Do too much lollipopping and pruning
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.360]  This is one that I recommend pruning and lollipopping a little bit less if you let all those little balls grow
[14:48.360 --> 14:54.100]  They will fill in and that will make one giant nugget all the way up the branches will be big fat colas if you don't
[14:54.100 --> 14:57.340]  Take too much off. So leave a lot of that. That's my advice
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.680]  Even the bottom buds on these plants will get frosty and dense if they're getting just a little bit of light
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.900]  They'll fill in don't worry about that. I
[15:06.340 --> 15:11.700]  Usually most of the time when I'm talking about growing I recommend and suggest a heavy defoliation
[15:12.160 --> 15:16.780]  Not with these plants if you were going to defoliate your John lemon go medium
[15:16.780 --> 15:21.480]  Maybe just a little above medium, but do not go hard. They don't reply. Well, they don't react
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.080]  Well respond well to that you'll get hate mail. They'll tell you they're pissed off for the next week or so
[15:26.080 --> 15:33.480]  They won't recover. So go light with the defoliation go light to medium. Maybe medium hard medium at the most
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.200]  Popping and twisting is okay with these plants. They will take it very well and it does slow down that vertical growth
[15:40.280 --> 15:42.120]  So as soon as you throw them into flower
[15:42.120 --> 15:48.300]  Maybe even a week before flower pop and twist all those stems as soon as they recover about 14 21 days
[15:48.300 --> 15:54.600]  Guess what pop and twist again or do it in more spaces? They're growing. There's more space to pop and twist keep popping
[15:54.600 --> 15:59.120]  They will keep growing and it'll slow them down from going up. They'll keep growing out. They'll get wider
[15:59.120 --> 16:04.640]  They'll get stockier and they will recover from that before they start flowering. Where are we? I've got more notes
[16:05.200 --> 16:08.920]  They do react well to topping but I wouldn't recommend topping them too many times
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.680]  I think one top kind of low to make all those lower branches meet
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.560]  Because these plants will make one giant top Cola if you don't take it out take that out all the bottoms will meet they'll meet
[16:18.560 --> 16:20.800]  Right up to it. I wouldn't go more than one top
[16:21.200 --> 16:26.140]  These plants do not like the screen of green method very well
[16:26.140 --> 16:29.340]  They don't like to be trellised and manipulated and pulled around too much
[16:29.340 --> 16:34.960]  I usually do a screen when they're low to spread them out. So these plants like to go up
[16:34.960 --> 16:39.640]  I put a screen on them and pull them down to make them go out and then I can shape them the way I want
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.320]  After that, I don't do a lot of manipulation
[16:42.320 --> 16:47.360]  Most of the time I'll do some weaving and do that weave the arms in where I want them now with these plants
[16:47.360 --> 16:52.280]  I realize they probably grow better if I don't weave them into the net. So I do minimal trellising
[16:52.280 --> 16:56.720]  I do a spreader and I do a supporter a lot of your plants are gonna get really tall really quickly
[16:56.720 --> 17:01.720]  So I recommend at least that support net or maybe some sticks or tomato cages or something like that
[17:01.720 --> 17:07.520]  Because they are going to get tall a lot of the phenotypes will be very robust and turgid and be able to hold themselves
[17:07.520 --> 17:13.680]  Up, some of them will need supports, especially when they start developing big fat chunky frosty
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.760]  I'm just exaggerating big beautiful buds. You guys are gonna need some supports for that
[17:18.840 --> 17:24.840]  One thing I have noticed is that these plants do eat a lot of nitrogen and they do benefit from continued nitrogen
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.200]  Into the flowering phase a lot of times they'll run out of nitrogen kind of early
[17:29.200 --> 17:34.640]  So a good way to prevent that is to continue your veg feed a couple of weeks into flower
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.060]  A lot of times we just cut out that veg nutrient right away. We quit giving it nitrogen
[17:39.060 --> 17:41.620]  We switch right to the bloom newts on day one of flower
[17:41.860 --> 17:49.220]  These plants will run out of nitrogen or have the opportunity or are likely to run out of nitrogen if you do things that way
[17:49.220 --> 17:53.540]  I don't recommend giving them just a big hit of nitrogen right before you flip them
[17:53.540 --> 17:59.540]  They won't like that they will benefit and they will appreciate it and respond better if you give them lower doses of nitrogen
[17:59.940 --> 18:04.460]  Later into the flowering phase maybe all the way up to day 14, maybe even a little later
[18:04.860 --> 18:08.500]  They will start burning out of nitrogen and they do grow for 10
[18:08.500 --> 18:12.100]  Maybe more weeks be prepared if you do run out of nitrogen
[18:12.100 --> 18:15.700]  You can foliar feed them feed them your base nutrient that will help
[18:15.700 --> 18:22.100]  But once you start seeing it, it will be a chase and a race because they will eat a lot of nitrogen
[18:22.100 --> 18:27.300]  That's gonna start throwing everything else out of whack also, so give them some nitrogen early in flower
[18:27.300 --> 18:32.500]  Don't cut that out. Now. Let's talk a little bit about phenotypes. That's always everybody's favorite
[18:32.500 --> 18:34.500]  I'm going to give my disclaimer
[18:34.780 --> 18:40.180]  Everybody always asks not everybody a lot of people ask. What's your favorite phenotype or what phenotype would you pick?
[18:41.780 --> 18:45.460]  That phenotype popped up in my garden and it was perfect for
[18:45.860 --> 18:51.500]  Me it may not even pop up in your garden since you've got different lights air water soil microbes nutrients
[18:52.060 --> 18:55.060]  Different love different music. Everything is different in there
[18:55.060 --> 18:59.340]  and you may not even see the same phenotypes that I have because a phenotype is an
[18:59.500 --> 19:04.620]  Expression based on an environment if you don't have the same environment, you may not even get the same expression
[19:04.700 --> 19:11.020]  So that's step one of talking about phenotypes. The other part is when I select a phenotype. I am selecting it for me
[19:11.020 --> 19:14.700]  That's who I want to smoke grow breed
[19:15.060 --> 19:20.500]  Take pictures of smell it look at it for the next year or two. That's the plan. I'm working with
[19:20.940 --> 19:24.900]  It's kind of like picking your date. Do you want me to select your date?
[19:25.260 --> 19:29.980]  I like to describe phenotype selection kind of like this. I made a bunch of seeds
[19:29.980 --> 19:37.960]  There are several lines to pick from we have agreed you want lemons you want sour you want diesel feel so you pick John Lemon
[19:37.960 --> 19:43.120]  That's what you've got now in my mind. We've got it narrowed down pretty damn close to what we got
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.860]  I'm gonna compare this to we've all decided that we want Italian food. We've all now driven to the Italian restaurant
[19:48.860 --> 19:50.380]  That's what we're gonna call John Lemon
[19:50.380 --> 19:56.460]  It's just got weird and it became Italian food, but follow along this will all make sense in the end when we get to the Italian
[19:56.460 --> 20:01.060]  Restaurant, they're gonna pass us a menu on that menu is gonna be nine different kinds of pasta
[20:01.060 --> 20:04.220]  There'd probably be an eggplant dish. There'd be a bunch of other great shit in there
[20:04.940 --> 20:09.660]  You might want the white sauce. You might want the garlic sauce. I'm going for the red sauce today
[20:09.660 --> 20:14.220]  I usually do the white sauce, but I already assigned it to somebody else. We all want different sauces, right?
[20:14.220 --> 20:19.500]  So that is kind of what I think it's like when we're selecting phenotypes. We've all decided we want Italian food now
[20:19.500 --> 20:23.940]  It's up to you to pick if you want the marinara or if you want the garlic sauce or if you want the white sauce
[20:23.940 --> 20:28.980]  I've driven you to the Italian restaurant. I got you that far. So phenotype selection
[20:28.980 --> 20:30.900]  I don't want to choose off the menu for you
[20:30.900 --> 20:34.220]  You've got to open up the menu and see which one gets your opinion
[20:34.540 --> 20:40.500]  The phenotype I'm going to select is great for me. The meal I'm going to select is perfect for me. I'm a vegetarian
[20:40.500 --> 20:43.340]  I like this. I like this. I'm gonna order the right shit for me
[20:43.340 --> 20:47.040]  You may want to order totally different shit and that's how your phenotype may be
[20:47.040 --> 20:51.680]  I want the one that takes a long time to finish not in this case. I want that 10 week or but generally
[20:51.680 --> 20:59.180]  I want a long sativa dominant longer finishing longer flowering plant with a lot of flavor that gets me wrecked when I smoke it
[20:59.180 --> 21:05.560]  That's got a certain shape. I don't really care too much about the colors and the certain things. I'm not growing it for Instagram
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.960]  I want it to be potent. I need to be resistant to pathogen. I want it to not be intersex
[21:10.960 --> 21:15.620]  I really need it to handle problems and bugs well because I'm gonna breed to it make market seeds out of it
[21:15.620 --> 21:17.700]  So I've got a different criteria than you
[21:17.700 --> 21:23.680]  You may want one that grows short and squat and tastes like chocolate and has an indica dominant buzz and puts you on the couch
[21:23.980 --> 21:26.760]  So me telling you which phenotype to select
[21:27.460 --> 21:32.340]  Doesn't do either one of us any good in my opinion. We've driven to the Italian restaurant
[21:32.340 --> 21:36.820]  You've got the menu grow them out find the Italian dish in there. That is the best for you
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.420]  now with that being said let's talk about some of the
[21:40.020 --> 21:46.220]  Phenotypical expressions I have experienced in my test growers and my friends growing these strains have experienced
[21:46.700 --> 21:53.300]  There is the sour phenotype then there is the more sour phenotype. All of the phenotypes are sour
[21:53.900 --> 21:58.480]  The main difference some is gonna have more diesel than others. Some is gonna have
[21:59.500 --> 22:03.220]  So the main difference is the growth structure. We'll talk about the flavors and I've already talked about that
[22:03.220 --> 22:08.980]  We'll touch on that again in a second. The main difference is the growth structure the sour D phenotype kind of creeps outward
[22:09.060 --> 22:13.180]  It branches out it gets a little bit wider the lemon skunk phenotype gets a little bit taller
[22:13.180 --> 22:18.020]  It doesn't grow out as wide so you don't need as much space between plants, but it's gonna get taller
[22:18.020 --> 22:21.420]  So you need more vertical space for that one other differences?
[22:21.420 --> 22:26.460]  Like I mentioned before our flavors and aromas those are things that you'll notice as soon as you start flowering
[22:26.580 --> 22:28.580]  You may notice some of these differences
[22:28.960 --> 22:33.900]  One thing I notice is some of my favorite phenotypes if you give it a little stem rub and smell your fingers
[22:33.900 --> 22:37.780]  It is cat piss and ammonia and I love it, but let's stay on track here
[22:37.780 --> 22:43.380]  I've got notes in front of me of the background aromas the so it's sour and lemons. That is obvious
[22:43.380 --> 22:46.020]  That is the main ingredient the main aromas you're gonna smell here
[22:46.020 --> 22:51.980]  Sour is just overwhelmingly kind of gross sour and then you've got lemons just fresh ripe lemon
[22:51.980 --> 22:56.140]  So it's like oh, that's grossly good and lemons. Oh gross
[22:56.140 --> 23:01.060]  You make a pucker face and you smell it again, then there are background and backup aromas
[23:01.060 --> 23:04.580]  They come with that some of those are like diesel fuel or gasoline
[23:04.940 --> 23:12.420]  Then there's skunk in there some of them smell like sour skunk gas, but then we've got things like I've been talking about ammonia
[23:12.940 --> 23:15.380]  Cat piss and real astringent flavors like that
[23:15.380 --> 23:19.860]  There's one of them that randomly throws out a little bit of lavender turps and I don't know where that comes from
[23:20.220 --> 23:28.180]  One thing I've noticed though that I think that medium and feed really play a huge difference in the flavors and aromas of this cross
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.380]  When I grow it in soilless mix
[23:30.380 --> 23:34.780]  It tastes pretty pretty similar pretty much the same way when I put it in cocoa
[23:34.780 --> 23:37.540]  It tastes different when my friends grow it in living soil
[23:37.540 --> 23:39.860]  It really brings out that lavender sort of thing
[23:39.860 --> 23:42.300]  I brought out sort of a floral turf that I could not quite describe
[23:42.900 --> 23:47.660]  Still had that main sour thing to it, but there was something at the end. I've got a really sensitive palette
[23:47.660 --> 23:52.420]  I can really identify things. I like to think I like to believe I seem to have proven that theory
[23:52.420 --> 23:56.580]  But there was a lavender sweetness at the end of it and he runs organic living soil
[23:56.580 --> 24:02.540]  So that seemed to bring that out. Alright, ladies and gentlemen boys and girls. That is my report on John lemon
[24:02.540 --> 24:04.820]  I feel like I rushed through that one kind of quickly
[24:04.900 --> 24:09.380]  So if you need more details more information if you have any questions corrections comments or concerns

[24:39.700 --> 24:42.860]  It's good to be back from the other sickness the virus the plague
[24:42.860 --> 24:45.100]  I feel like I flowed pretty good on this one
[24:45.100 --> 24:50.620]  This was the first episode that I actually really felt comfortable on and natural again. So thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out
[24:50.620 --> 24:55.180]  I'm gonna wrap it up while it's still a good show. I'll be back in a week with fresh new content
