[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Alright, what's up podcast world?
[00:01.720 --> 00:03.520]  It is Rasta Jeff here taking a little break.
[00:03.520 --> 00:05.640]  I've been packing up seeds all evening.
[00:05.640 --> 00:10.860]  It is time to record episode 485 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.860 --> 00:14.560]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Hear Now.
[00:14.560 --> 00:19.000]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:19.000 --> 00:27.320]  Seeds Hear Now, and you can find them at www.seedshearnow.com.
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.960]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:30.960 --> 00:35.480]  Today I've been taking dabs of Fortissimo Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[00:35.480 --> 00:36.880]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:36.880 --> 00:39.720]  This is a blend of Crescendo and HSB.
[00:39.720 --> 00:46.080]  The flavor on the package is described as 98 octane and dumpster, and I completely agree
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.080]  with that.
[00:47.080 --> 00:50.800]  I say it smells like gas and dumpster and a little bit of bar trash can.
[00:50.800 --> 00:56.420]  I know that sounds disgusting, but it is definitely an appealing aroma when it comes to a concentrate.
[00:56.420 --> 01:03.540]  On the back of the package it says this product contains 60.85% THC and non-detectable amounts
[01:03.540 --> 01:04.540]  of CBD.
[01:04.540 --> 01:07.820]  I really enjoy the Fortissimo Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:07.820 --> 01:13.060]  This was a four gram jar, and when I cracked it open, it was all one big crystal.
[01:13.060 --> 01:18.740]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the impressive concentrates.
[01:18.740 --> 01:23.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,
[01:23.140 --> 01:27.460]  In this episode I am going to read an email about strains that I have bred.
[01:27.460 --> 01:32.060]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:32.060 --> 01:35.540]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:35.540 --> 01:36.980]  to my good friend Miss Mel.
[01:36.980 --> 01:40.820]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our buddy Paul A.
[01:40.820 --> 01:44.100]  Of course I want to send a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Tanner
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.100]  M.
[01:45.100 --> 01:48.500]  I always want to send a big high five and a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.740]  thank you to our friends at Hogan's Farms.
[01:50.780 --> 01:53.900]  Of course a big thank you to our friend Captain Mojo.
[01:53.900 --> 01:57.180]  I always want to send a big thank you high five to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:57.180 --> 01:59.700]  I always need to send a big thank you to BAFSTA.
[01:59.700 --> 02:05.860]  And last but certainly not least, a big Viking handshake to our friend Grimble the Druid.
[02:05.860 --> 02:10.540]  Big thanks, big shout out, and big love to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:10.540 --> 02:16.820]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:16.820 --> 02:19.260]  forward slash growfromyourheart.
[02:19.260 --> 02:23.540]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:23.540 --> 02:24.540]  All right, podcast world.
[02:24.540 --> 02:28.700]  I did say that I was going to read an email about strains that I have bred.
[02:28.700 --> 02:30.780]  Let's jump right into that.
[02:30.780 --> 02:35.420]  This message came from our friend Andrew in Massachusetts and it goes just like this.
[02:35.420 --> 02:37.060]  Hi, Rasta Jeff.
[02:37.060 --> 02:38.540]  Feel free to use my name.
[02:38.540 --> 02:41.060]  I'm Andrew from Massachusetts.
[02:41.060 --> 02:42.480]  Big shout out to my new friend Andrew.
[02:42.480 --> 02:44.180]  Thank you for the great email.
[02:44.180 --> 02:45.460]  The question goes like this.
[02:45.460 --> 02:49.940]  I was wondering if you could do an episode on some of your strains that are similar but
[02:49.940 --> 02:51.620]  different.
[02:51.620 --> 02:56.300]  Lemon Jeffrey is feminized, but how different is it from Firefly or Lemon Sunrise or Sonic
[02:56.300 --> 03:04.060]  Boom or perhaps Orangegasm versus Sunkiss, maybe Strawberry Starburst versus Pure Love?
[03:04.060 --> 03:08.740]  With some being so close genetically like cousins or aunts or nieces, I'm wondering
[03:08.740 --> 03:13.380]  if there will be noticeable differences between strains or should I settle for whatever I
[03:13.380 --> 03:15.380]  can find in stock?
[03:15.380 --> 03:19.100]  I just chopped down my first Arise and I could not be more impressed.
[03:19.100 --> 03:24.540]  I can't wait to run some more iRegenetics and I just would like to get as clear an idea
[03:24.540 --> 03:29.580]  as possible of the traits of anything that shares common ancestry.
[03:29.580 --> 03:31.980]  Then they sign it with much love from Andrew.
[03:31.980 --> 03:37.940]  Hey, Andrew, there are a lot of great questions in this email, so let's get right to it.
[03:37.940 --> 03:41.500]  Just to catch people up, just in case people are not aware, I am a seed breeder.
[03:41.500 --> 03:44.660]  I am the sole breeder for iRegenetics premium seeds.
[03:44.700 --> 03:46.660]  I make regular and feminized seeds.
[03:46.660 --> 03:48.700]  I work with a strain called Arise.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.540]  That is one of my most popular females.
[03:50.540 --> 03:54.140]  Of course, I use an Arise male plant for many other crosses.
[03:54.140 --> 03:57.180]  I also am known for the Lemon Jeffrey and a few others.
[03:57.180 --> 03:59.500]  Let's focus more on the strains this person asked about.
[03:59.500 --> 04:03.700]  I just wanted everybody to know what this message stemmed from.
[04:03.700 --> 04:09.780]  The first question is, Lemon Jeffrey is feminized, but how different is it from Firefly or Lemon
[04:09.780 --> 04:12.900]  Sunrise or even Sonic Boom?
[04:12.900 --> 04:18.500]  That is a very good question because all of those strains have very similar yet distinctly
[04:18.500 --> 04:21.260]  different characteristics in the description.
[04:21.260 --> 04:24.940]  Many of them have very similar parents in their lineage.
[04:24.940 --> 04:26.020]  Let's talk about that.
[04:26.020 --> 04:27.780]  Lemon Jeffrey, what is Lemon Jeffrey?
[04:27.780 --> 04:33.940]  Lemon Jeffrey is a female golden goat that was reversed to create feminized pollen.
[04:33.940 --> 04:37.980]  I use that feminized pollen on a female lemon skunk.
[04:37.980 --> 04:40.800]  That is what created Lemon Jeffrey.
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.520]  Lemon Jeffrey is a reversed golden goat to a female lemon skunk.
[04:44.520 --> 04:46.240]  I've done a full episode on Lemon Jeffrey.
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.560]  I go into great detail on that strain.
[04:48.560 --> 04:54.800]  For this episode, we will describe it as a tropical lemon candied flavored sativa dominant
[04:54.800 --> 04:55.800]  hybrid.
[04:55.800 --> 04:57.280]  That's a really quick description.
[04:57.280 --> 05:01.200]  But then how is the Lemon Jeffrey different from Firefly?
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.880]  That is a really good question.
[05:02.880 --> 05:04.760]  Let's talk quickly about Firefly.
[05:04.760 --> 05:08.520]  Firefly is a cross of Lemon Skunk and Arise.
[05:08.520 --> 05:13.400]  Lemon Skunk is the same Lemon Skunk as used in the Lemon Jeffrey cross.
[05:13.400 --> 05:15.440]  That is Lemon Skunk to Arise.
[05:15.440 --> 05:21.880]  It is very similar to the Lemon Jeffrey, but you are going to get some sort of funky, gassy.
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.560]  It doesn't have the sweet tropical flavor from the golden goat as much in there.
[05:25.560 --> 05:30.060]  It does have golden goat, but it has only got a quarter of the golden goat in its lineage
[05:30.060 --> 05:31.360]  as compared to half.
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.560]  We've watered down the golden goat a little bit.
[05:33.560 --> 05:36.520]  We've put some OG Kush and Kim D flavors in there.
[05:36.520 --> 05:38.600]  It's very similar to the Lemon Jeffrey.
[05:38.600 --> 05:41.220]  However, it is not feminized.
[05:41.220 --> 05:44.200]  The main difference is the flavor and the aroma.
[05:44.200 --> 05:46.960]  The Firefly will get a little bit funkier.
[05:46.960 --> 05:49.560]  It's got a little bit more of a lemon pledge sort of a thing.
[05:49.560 --> 05:55.340]  It also grows a little bit taller with a little bit more dense of a bud structure.
[05:55.340 --> 05:58.760]  The next one you ask about is the Lemon Sunrise.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.880]  That's a really good question.
[05:59.880 --> 06:03.280]  How is Lemon Jeffrey different from Lemon Sunrise?
[06:03.280 --> 06:11.200]  Lemon Sunrise was my non-feminized response to requests for non-fem Lemon Jeffrey.
[06:11.200 --> 06:16.220]  Many people fell in love with Lemon Jeffrey, but they did not like feminized seeds.
[06:16.220 --> 06:19.040]  Many people have a preference of feminized or non-fems.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.040]  That is up to you.
[06:20.040 --> 06:24.000]  Many people did not want feminized Lemon Jeffrey seeds.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.680]  I pollinated the Lemon Jeffrey with my prized Arise Male, and that made Lemon Sunrise.
[06:30.880 --> 06:36.080]  Let's backtrack and talk about the differences between the Firefly and the Lemon Sunrise.
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.800]  These are both regular seeds.
[06:37.800 --> 06:40.400]  These are non-feminized strains.
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.720]  Let's talk about these.
[06:41.720 --> 06:46.880]  Firefly, like I said earlier, has more of the skunky, dank, funky aroma.
[06:46.880 --> 06:50.360]  I say more of a stank lemon flavor.
[06:50.360 --> 06:55.800]  The Lemon Sunrise is going to have a softer, sweeter lemon flavor.
[06:55.800 --> 07:01.120]  If you're looking for lemon pledge, gassy, dirty feet, and lemons, lemons and funk,
[07:01.120 --> 07:04.540]  lemons and kush, the Firefly is the way to go there.
[07:04.540 --> 07:09.860]  If you want more of a softer, sweeter, lemon sorbet kind of a flavor, the Lemon Sunrise
[07:09.860 --> 07:11.120]  is the route for that one.
[07:11.120 --> 07:14.540]  The Firefly and the Lemon Sunrise will grow very similarly.
[07:14.540 --> 07:17.400]  The Firefly will make a little bit more dense of a bud.
[07:17.400 --> 07:21.320]  The Lemon Sunrise will make a little airier of a bud, but it's going to get a little bigger
[07:21.320 --> 07:22.600]  of a bud also.
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.640]  It will weigh the same in the end.
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.520]  Now let's backtrack even more and talk about the Lemon Jeffrey and how it varies from all
[07:28.520 --> 07:29.840]  of those.
[07:29.840 --> 07:35.800]  The Lemon Jeffrey is different from the Firefly because it is straight soft, lemon head candy
[07:35.800 --> 07:36.800]  flavors.
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.040]  I describe it as if you dumped out a box of lemon heads and smelled the box.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.040]  It's really soft.
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.200]  It is really smooth.
[07:42.200 --> 07:45.520]  It's kind of lemon sorbet, country time lemonade powder.
[07:45.520 --> 07:49.220]  It's more gentle is the way I explain it, but it is feminized.
[07:49.220 --> 07:52.640]  That's how that one really stands out from the rest of the crowd.
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.240]  Now there is another cross that is very similar in this mix, which you asked about, which
[07:56.240 --> 07:58.000]  is the Sonic Boom.
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.880]  Sonic Boom is actually Lemon OG Hayes Cross to Arise.
[08:02.880 --> 08:06.080]  Lemon OG Hayes came from our friends at Ethos Collective.
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.580]  Big shout out to my buddy, Colin.
[08:07.580 --> 08:09.200]  You're doing great work over there.
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.840]  The Lemon OG Hayes, I discovered her in a commercial facility and I fell in love with
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.640]  that plant immediately.
[08:15.640 --> 08:17.300]  It grows like a champ.
[08:17.300 --> 08:18.300]  You can't beat it up.
[08:18.300 --> 08:19.640]  You can't cause it problems.
[08:19.640 --> 08:20.640]  You can't stress it out.
[08:20.640 --> 08:24.160]  It doesn't like spider mites and it just seemed to eat like a champ.
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.680]  And no matter what we did to it, it put out giant colas that always smell like lemon lime
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.860]  Gatorade and I fucking love it.
[08:30.860 --> 08:33.400]  So that's where the Lemon OG Hayes came from.
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.020]  I crossed that to my Arise.
[08:35.020 --> 08:42.080]  My goal was to increase the vigor and potency of the Lemon OG Hayes and it absolutely worked.
[08:42.080 --> 08:47.800]  It is more of a Gatorade lemon lime sort of a flavor, more than the lemon flavor of the
[08:47.800 --> 08:50.400]  other strains we have talked about previously.
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.120]  The Sonic Boom does not have the lemon skunk as the Lemon Jeffrey, the Firefly or the Lemon
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.040]  Sunrise would carry in there.
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.880]  So that is going to be a vastly different cross from the other three.
[09:01.880 --> 09:04.460]  You will see very large differences.
[09:04.460 --> 09:10.120]  So I think that wraps up the talk about the Lemon Jeffrey versus Firefly, Lemon Sunrise
[09:10.120 --> 09:11.120]  and Sonic Boom.
[09:11.120 --> 09:13.960]  Just quickly, Lemon Jeffrey is a feminized seed.
[09:13.960 --> 09:15.720]  So that's why it stands out mainly.
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.640]  It produces that soft lemon, lemon head, country time lemonade flavor sort of a thing.
[09:21.640 --> 09:25.240]  Then the Firefly is that same lemon skunk crossed to the Arise.
[09:25.240 --> 09:27.760]  It's more of a cushy, gassy, stanky lemon.
[09:27.760 --> 09:30.920]  The Lemon Sunrise is the Lemon Jeffrey to Arise.
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.320]  That brings the sweet lemon.
[09:32.320 --> 09:36.320]  It brings a hint of the gas, but not nearly as much as the Firefly.
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.280]  Then we've got the Sonic Boom and that is a vastly different flavor profile, completely
[09:41.280 --> 09:42.720]  different bud structure.
[09:42.720 --> 09:47.360]  It lacks all of the lemon skunk traits because it does not have the lemon skunk in there
[09:47.360 --> 09:48.560]  at all.
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.440]  So now let's move forward to the second part of the question, which is Orangegasm versus
[09:52.440 --> 09:53.440]  Sunkiss.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.620]  I like that one a lot.
[09:54.620 --> 09:59.660]  The common parent in Orangegasm and Sunkiss is a platinum tangy plant.
[09:59.660 --> 10:02.640]  Platinum tangy came from our friends at Garden of Weeden.
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.800]  That is a female platinum Girl Scout cookies pollinated by a male tangy plant that was
[10:08.800 --> 10:10.320]  known as Julius.
[10:10.320 --> 10:11.680]  That makes platinum tangy.
[10:11.840 --> 10:15.680]  I really like the platinum tangy plant for a lot of reasons.
[10:15.680 --> 10:17.200]  It stays short.
[10:17.200 --> 10:18.840]  It grows nice and squat.
[10:18.840 --> 10:21.920]  Instead of getting tall and lanky, it makes a nice wide bush.
[10:21.920 --> 10:22.920]  I like the shape.
[10:22.920 --> 10:24.320]  I like the structure.
[10:24.320 --> 10:26.020]  It grows very easily.
[10:26.020 --> 10:28.020]  It does not have a lot of problems.
[10:28.020 --> 10:30.080]  It finishes fairly early.
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.180]  It has nice robust stalks, so it doesn't need a lot of support.
[10:34.180 --> 10:39.520]  It has a very nice leaf shape and structure, and the leaves that need to be defoliated
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.120]  are very obvious because of the size and shape of the leaves.
[10:43.120 --> 10:45.360]  I like how early it finishes.
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.440]  Then when you're done growing it, what stands out about the finished product is this amazing
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.060]  orange flavor.
[10:51.060 --> 10:53.440]  The oranges are super strong.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.160]  Then on the exhale, you get a hint of that Girl Scout cookie funkiness, and I really
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.740]  think it makes a beautiful balance.
[10:59.740 --> 11:03.200]  That is the platinum tangy that comes from our friends at Garden of Weeden.
[11:03.200 --> 11:05.880]  I fell in love with that one in a commercial facility.
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.320]  I acquired a cut, and I've been working with it for several years.
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.000]  I have made quite a few strains from that cut.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.240]  The Orange Gasm and the Sun Kiss, and also the Michelangelo come from that cut.
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.360]  Let's talk a little bit about the differences between Orange Gasm and Sun Kiss.
[11:22.360 --> 11:29.000]  Orange Gasm is the platinum tangy cut pollinated by that reversed golden goat that makes Lemon
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Jeffrey.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.180]  Those are made side by side.
[11:31.180 --> 11:35.600]  Orange Gasm and Lemon Jeffrey are made in the same room from the same reversed golden
[11:35.600 --> 11:36.600]  goat.
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.200]  A platinum tangy female pollinated by a reversed golden goat.
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.440]  That one brings out a lot of citrusy, sweet orange flavors.
[11:46.440 --> 11:49.000]  You will get a little bit of orange rind in there.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.560]  Some phenotypes may express a flavor of grapefruit.
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.080]  There will be a hint of grapefruit turps in there.
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.920]  That is not the most common aroma or flavor, but it will pop up in some phenotypes.
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.040]  Now let's talk about the Sun Kiss.
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.600]  Sun Kiss is that same platinum tangy female pollinated by the Arise.
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.600]  We are going to see a lot of similarities in the Orange Gasm and the Sun Kiss because
[12:14.600 --> 12:17.200]  the Arise also has the golden goat.
[12:17.200 --> 12:19.680]  Golden goat is the mother of Arise.
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.080]  We are also going to get a little bit of funk in there because it's also got Chem D and
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.440]  Joseph O.G.
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.400]  We're going to get some of the Daybreaker traits.
[12:27.400 --> 12:30.560]  We're going to get Arise traits, and we're going to get those platinum cookies and the
[12:30.560 --> 12:32.640]  tangy traits in there.
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.700]  Most phenotypes of the Sun Kiss stay short and squat and grow bushy.
[12:36.700 --> 12:38.840]  The Orange Gasm will do that as well.
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.520]  But the main difference you are going to see is that we may get a little bit taller phenotypes
[12:43.520 --> 12:49.360]  from the Sun Kiss, and we may get longer finishing phenotypes from the Sun Kiss.
[12:49.360 --> 12:55.800]  We also may get a hint of funkier, nastier, cushier aromas from the Sun Kiss.
[12:55.800 --> 13:00.120]  The main difference is that those are a regular and a feminized seed line.
[13:00.120 --> 13:03.640]  That is the main outstanding difference between the two of those.
[13:03.640 --> 13:06.040]  Let's talk a little bit about the Michelangelo since we're here.
[13:06.040 --> 13:08.080]  You didn't mention that one.
[13:08.080 --> 13:14.360]  Michelangelo is that same platinum tangy female pollinated by a reversed blueberry cookies
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.200]  female that made pollen.
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.200]  So we created the Michelangelo feminized line.
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.880]  Michelangelo generally has the same growth characteristics as the Orange Gasm and the
[13:25.880 --> 13:26.880]  Sun Kiss.
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.360]  Generally, short, squatty plants, about eight week finishers.
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.520]  You will find some outliers in all of these that are shorter and longer finishers.
[13:34.520 --> 13:40.140]  But generally we've got short, squatty plants with a very orange dominant aroma.
[13:40.140 --> 13:46.080]  The difference with the Michelangelo is that we bring a little bit of a grapey, blue raspberry,
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.400]  funky sort of a blue nerds, maybe those blue lollipops we used to suck on when we were
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.180]  kids that turned our whole face blue.
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.040]  It's got a hint of that flavor to it.
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.920]  It's kind of like we took some oranges and rolled them around in grape fun dip or something
[13:59.920 --> 14:01.880]  like that, or a blue raspberry fun dip.
[14:01.880 --> 14:08.160]  It is a really neat flavor combination, very candy, very orangey, very funky.
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.960]  Then sometimes you'll get a hint of that cookies from the Tahoe and the cookies in the background.
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.020]  So the Michelangelo is very similar to the Orange Gasm and the Sun Kiss, but it also
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.600]  has a little pizzazz to it.
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.280]  It's got a little bit of blue color on there.
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.440]  And I know it sounds crazy that I express flavors and colors, but if you think about
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.000]  it, when you see red stuff, you always think it's either fruit punch or strawberry.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.760]  If you see blue shit, you think it's blueberry.
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.760]  When you see orange, you think it's orange flavored.
[14:31.760 --> 14:34.840]  My brain works very much in that sort of a thing.
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.120]  That is why the TMNT line got named the way it did.
[14:38.120 --> 14:39.280]  I've explained that before.
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.520]  Let's keep moving here.
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.360]  Let's recap on the main differences on the Orange Gasm, the Sun Kiss, and the Michelangelo.
[14:45.360 --> 14:47.640]  Orange Gasm is feminized.
[14:47.640 --> 14:48.880]  Michelangelo is feminized.
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.360]  The main difference is Sun Kiss is a non-feminized version of these lines.
[14:53.360 --> 14:55.120]  It is a regular seed.
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.760]  Sun Kiss is going to be completely orangey, a little bit of funky.
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.880]  Orange Gasm, orangey, maybe a little bit more citrus, maybe some grapefruit.
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.520]  In the Michelangelo, you're going to get oranges with all those blue and purple flavors attached
[15:07.520 --> 15:08.520]  to that.
[15:08.520 --> 15:12.640]  Let's move forward and talk about Strawberry Starburst versus Pure Love.
[15:12.640 --> 15:15.000]  Those are very different crosses.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.600]  The Strawberry Starburst is Strawberry Fields from Crockett Family Farms.
[15:19.600 --> 15:22.040]  That one I acquired at another commercial facility.
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.600]  It grows giant colas that smell like strawberry candies.
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.720]  I was always satisfied with the harvest weight and the appearance, but I was never satisfied
[15:30.720 --> 15:31.960]  with the potency.
[15:31.960 --> 15:37.320]  My goal was to pollinate it with my King Solomon and increase the potency of the Strawberry
[15:37.320 --> 15:38.320]  Fields.
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.960]  That created Strawberry Starburst.
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.200]  I hit my goal spot on with that one.
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.560]  Pure Love is a cross of Zach Haze to Arise.
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.520]  Zach Haze is Killer Haze and Strawberry Cough.
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.800]  Strawberry flavors are very different than the Strawberry Starburst flavor.
[15:54.800 --> 15:58.160]  This is more of an actual strawberry aroma.
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.640]  The Strawberry Starburst is more like a strawberry gum, a strawberry candy.
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.240]  It's also been described as those candies that your grandma has in the candy dish.
[16:06.240 --> 16:08.360]  It's wrapped in the strawberry-looking wrapper.
[16:08.360 --> 16:10.120]  The Strawberry Starburst has that flavor.
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.560]  The Pure Love is more like an actual strawberry air freshener sort of a thing.
[16:14.560 --> 16:16.920]  There's a big difference there, in my opinion.
[16:16.920 --> 16:19.320]  The Pure Love has some haze in it.
[16:20.200 --> 16:22.680]  The Killer Haze traits are going to pop out of there.
[16:22.680 --> 16:25.400]  That is going to make the plants take a little bit longer to finish.
[16:25.400 --> 16:27.000]  They're going to get a little bit taller.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  They're going to have possibly more of like a psychedelic sort of a buzz.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.320]  The Strawberry Starburst is a little bit more candy, bubble gummy, possibly watermelon.
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.800]  The Pure Love, you're going to get more of the funky aroma from the Arise.
[16:39.800 --> 16:41.760]  They've both got the Arise parent in there.
[16:41.760 --> 16:43.800]  You're going to get some of that funk in there from the Arise.
[16:43.800 --> 16:46.240]  It comes more dominantly in the Pure Love.
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.680]  If you want strawberry candy, watermelons, if you want something to press and make rosin
[16:50.680 --> 16:53.480]  out of, Strawberry Starburst is the way to go.
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.000]  If you're going to make BHO out of it, Pure Love is the way to go.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  That one's got a little bit more of a real strawberry flavor as compared to the artificial
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.040]  candy and it's also going to bring a little bit of that dirty foot, gassy, cushy sort of
[17:05.040 --> 17:06.520]  a flavor.
[17:06.520 --> 17:09.600]  Another one we should include in there is the Raphael.
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.520]  Raphael is the Strawberry Starburst pollinated by that blueberry cookies that I talked about
[17:14.520 --> 17:15.760]  earlier.
[17:16.280 --> 17:20.960]  Raphael brings that really sweet strawberry candy flavor, but it's also got that blue
[17:20.960 --> 17:23.440]  raspberry funky wang to it.
[17:23.440 --> 17:26.120]  Those blue and purple flavors added on top of it.
[17:26.120 --> 17:30.320]  It really makes it really unique strawberry blueberry combination.
[17:30.320 --> 17:31.500]  It's really fruity.
[17:31.500 --> 17:33.120]  It's really bubble gummy.
[17:33.120 --> 17:36.120]  It can almost be a watermelon blueberry bubble gum sort of a thing.
[17:36.120 --> 17:39.320]  There are a lot of really unique flavors that come from that.
[17:39.320 --> 17:42.520]  The main difference between Strawberry Starburst and Pure Love.
[17:42.520 --> 17:45.320]  Strawberry Starburst is going to be more strawberry candy.
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.080]  Pure Love, you're going to get some of that gas and then Raphael is strawberries with
[17:49.080 --> 17:50.800]  a wang to it.
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.600]  And of course the Raphael is a feminized line.
[17:53.600 --> 17:56.640]  The other two are regular seeds.
[17:56.640 --> 18:00.280]  So I'm sure by now you've noticed that I'm using a lot of the same strains in a lot of
[18:00.280 --> 18:01.280]  my crosses.
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.440]  I'm just using different pollen donors on different females to create diversity and
[18:05.440 --> 18:07.160]  kind of branch out a little bit.
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.080]  I'm using several females.
[18:09.080 --> 18:12.680]  I am mainly using that King Solomon as my main real male.
[18:12.680 --> 18:18.640]  I'm also using several females and reversing them to create more crosses from proven and
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.480]  trusted females, which I know are reliable.
[18:21.480 --> 18:24.440]  I've been working with many of these crosses for several years.
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.320]  I've got a very verified stable.
[18:26.320 --> 18:29.360]  I know that everything I've got is exactly what it is labeled.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.360]  I know where it came from.
[18:30.360 --> 18:31.880]  I know where that person got it.
[18:31.880 --> 18:32.880]  I've bred with it.
[18:32.880 --> 18:35.040]  I've tested all of these things several times.
[18:35.040 --> 18:37.020]  So I've got a very nice stable to work with.
[18:37.020 --> 18:42.940]  My downfall or my limiting factor is that I am limited by the number of plants I can
[18:42.940 --> 18:45.180]  keep because of Colorado laws.
[18:45.180 --> 18:49.260]  I do have access to commercial facilities and I work with large grows, but most of my
[18:49.260 --> 18:51.540]  breeding happens in a personal grow.
[18:51.540 --> 18:54.180]  So I am limited to the amount of mother plants I can keep.
[18:54.180 --> 18:56.740]  I am limited to the amounts I can flower at a time.
[18:56.740 --> 18:59.860]  So that really makes my number of keeper plants limited.
[18:59.860 --> 19:02.740]  Yes, I do have friends that can keep plants for me.
[19:02.740 --> 19:06.300]  I do have plenty of other friends around here that do have gardens that maybe I can have
[19:06.300 --> 19:07.340]  them keep my mothers.
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.620]  But as a breeder, as somebody who relies on this as part of my life, somebody who I think
[19:11.620 --> 19:12.620]  I'm in love with these plants.
[19:12.620 --> 19:14.420]  No, I know I'm in love with these plants.
[19:14.420 --> 19:20.220]  I don't want to rely on anybody else to keep my genetics, my business, my passion alive.
[19:20.220 --> 19:26.180]  So I do my best to keep my very favorite mothers to where I can keep my selected moms, my selected
[19:26.180 --> 19:29.980]  males, and then I still have enough room on my plant count to do some pollination, to
[19:29.980 --> 19:31.420]  make some new crosses.
[19:31.420 --> 19:33.580]  Then occasionally I have to cull a few things.
[19:33.780 --> 19:37.060]  I have to sprout some seeds and I have to start fresh with lower numbers.
[19:37.060 --> 19:40.820]  So that's why you see a lot of repeats and a lot of things from the same sort of lines
[19:40.820 --> 19:42.660]  working in my projects.
[19:42.660 --> 19:46.860]  They are trusted, they are proven, and as a breeder, that is part of what you rely on
[19:46.860 --> 19:47.860]  me for.
[19:47.860 --> 19:51.420]  And that's what I rely on myself and my testers to test these lines for.
[19:51.420 --> 19:57.860]  The lines that come out in 2020 have been being tested since 2019 and possibly 2018.
[19:57.860 --> 20:01.460]  So sometimes it takes me a little while to get products out because I want to thoroughly
[20:01.540 --> 20:05.860]  test them to make sure that when you spend your money, you were getting a reliable seed
[20:05.860 --> 20:10.460]  pack that when you grow that you'll have something worth showing off, something worth consuming,
[20:10.460 --> 20:13.780]  something to make it worth all of your time, your energy, your effort, and your money,
[20:13.780 --> 20:17.900]  because I know how much effort and dedication we put into our grows.
[20:17.900 --> 20:22.340]  So my main limiting factor to keep my breeding from expanding is plant counts.
[20:22.340 --> 20:26.620]  I'm only allowed to have so many plants, but like I said, oftentimes I do cull things.
[20:26.620 --> 20:30.060]  I either get new plants from friends and I breed with those.
[20:30.060 --> 20:32.860]  Then I make sure that that offspring is worth using.
[20:32.860 --> 20:34.460]  I will send out those seeds to friends.
[20:34.460 --> 20:36.460]  I will grow those seeds myself.
[20:36.460 --> 20:40.020]  Sometimes I have friends in commercial facilities that will let me run a hundred seeds in one
[20:40.020 --> 20:41.020]  of their test rooms.
[20:41.020 --> 20:43.360]  Then I can really see what's happening there.
[20:43.360 --> 20:45.060]  Sometimes I scrap projects.
[20:45.060 --> 20:48.200]  Sometimes I say, no, we probably shouldn't give these seeds out to people.
[20:48.200 --> 20:51.620]  Sometimes I go, holy shit, I cannot wait to get these seeds out to people.
[20:51.620 --> 20:54.740]  But when I make a first cross, I don't make a lot of them the first time.
[20:54.740 --> 20:57.340]  I'll make a couple of hundred so we can test it.
[20:57.500 --> 21:00.740]  Then if it's good, then I go back and I make enough to where we can actually get it out
[21:00.740 --> 21:01.740]  to people.
[21:01.740 --> 21:04.900]  So it is a long process making, testing and verifying seeds.
[21:04.900 --> 21:10.140]  I am mainly limited by the amount of keepers that I can keep because of Colorado laws.
[21:10.140 --> 21:11.740]  But there were more questions in this email.
[21:11.740 --> 21:15.740]  It said, with some of your strains being so close genetically, like cousins or aunts and
[21:15.740 --> 21:21.260]  nieces, I'm wondering if there will be noticeable differences between strains or if I should
[21:21.260 --> 21:25.020]  just settle on whatever I can find in stock.
[21:25.020 --> 21:30.060]  Depending on which strains you were referring to, you may see very subtle differences.
[21:30.060 --> 21:34.020]  Some of them may be so close that you may just want to grab what is in stock.
[21:34.020 --> 21:38.380]  Since I am only able to keep so many mother plants and father plants, some strains will
[21:38.380 --> 21:39.860]  never be made again.
[21:39.860 --> 21:41.940]  So once they sell out, they are gone.
[21:41.940 --> 21:43.420]  I've got a jar of those seeds.
[21:43.420 --> 21:45.060]  I make a bunch of packages.
[21:45.060 --> 21:46.620]  They're requested by the vendors.
[21:46.620 --> 21:47.620]  They sell.
[21:47.620 --> 21:48.620]  Then that is it.
[21:48.620 --> 21:52.420]  I cannot make any more of those because I was forced or I chose to get rid of one of
[21:52.420 --> 21:56.460]  the mother plants or the father plant or part of that cross and I can no longer make
[21:56.460 --> 21:57.460]  it.
[21:57.460 --> 22:01.660]  So I would grab what is in stock when you can, if you can't find the exact strain you
[22:01.660 --> 22:03.140]  were looking for.
[22:03.140 --> 22:07.820]  The last paragraph of this email says, I just chopped down my first run of Arise and I could
[22:07.820 --> 22:09.540]  not be more impressed.
[22:09.540 --> 22:10.540]  That is awesome.
[22:10.540 --> 22:13.400]  I would love to see some photos of your Arise.
[22:13.400 --> 22:17.020]  If you didn't get photos while it was growing, I hope to see photos of your next grow of
[22:17.020 --> 22:18.960]  Irie Genetics seeds.
[22:18.960 --> 22:22.640]  It goes on to say, I cannot wait to run more Irie Genetics.
[22:22.640 --> 22:26.760]  Just would like to get as clear an idea as possible of the traits of anything that shares
[22:26.760 --> 22:27.760]  common ancestry.
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.200]  I think I did a pretty good job of giving you descriptions of things with very similar
[22:32.200 --> 22:33.580]  traits and similar parents.
[22:33.580 --> 22:36.980]  If you've got more questions, I would love a follow-up email.
[22:36.980 --> 22:41.720]  You know my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[22:41.720 --> 22:44.000]  You signed his email with much love from Andrew.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.600]  Hey Andrew, thank you for the great email.
[22:45.600 --> 22:48.640]  I do look forward to hearing from you in the future.
[22:49.320 --> 22:52.320]  I want to see photos of your Irie Genetics grows.
[22:52.320 --> 22:55.800]  All right, Podcast World, I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.120]  I need to get back to packaging up seeds for the Indoexpo.
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.760]  Don't forget that the Indoexpo is coming to Denver.
[23:01.760 --> 23:07.360]  Irie Genetics has a booth at the Indoexpo in Denver, January 25th and 26th.
[23:07.360 --> 23:09.320]  The 25th is Industry Day.
[23:09.320 --> 23:11.920]  The 26th is open to the general public.
[23:11.920 --> 23:17.360]  So check out the Indoexpo website, grab your tickets before they sell out because it will
[23:17.360 --> 23:18.360]  sell out.
[23:18.360 --> 23:20.400]  Make your travel arrangements early.
[23:20.400 --> 23:21.560]  Get yourself a nice hotel.
[23:21.560 --> 23:23.320]  Get yourself a sweet Airbnb.
[23:23.320 --> 23:26.840]  And I look forward to seeing you at the Indoexpo.
