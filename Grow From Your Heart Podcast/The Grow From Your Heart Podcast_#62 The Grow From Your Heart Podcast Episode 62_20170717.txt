[00:10.750 --> 00:21.940]  Yeah, what's up cannabis community? It's time for episode 62 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:21.940 --> 00:27.260]  podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're a new
[00:27.260 --> 00:31.060]  grower or a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're
[00:31.060 --> 00:34.780]  on probation and you can't smoke, if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just
[00:34.780 --> 00:38.980]  curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm
[00:38.980 --> 00:42.780]  your host Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. I want to send a huge thank you shout
[00:42.780 --> 00:45.600]  out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on the show. Big, huge thanks
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.980]  to Kat and Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Thanks for letting me play the music.
[00:49.980 --> 00:53.260]  The song you're hearing right now is called the Constant Struggle. So sitting at the table
[00:53.260 --> 00:57.340]  with me is our new guest, Mr. Paul Rosales. How are you doing my friend? Good. Should
[00:57.340 --> 00:59.900]  I say your whole name or is that not a good thing? No, that's fine. All right. I thought
[00:59.900 --> 01:03.220]  about it right after I said it. And across the table from me is a returning guest. We
[01:03.220 --> 01:07.660]  got Clint Stewart with us. How are you doing bro? What's up everybody? Hey everybody. Hey
[01:07.660 --> 01:11.300]  guys. I'm going to turn down that music so we can talk a little bit. How are you guys
[01:11.300 --> 01:15.940]  doing today? Doing good. I'm so high. My voice got higher. Everybody's high except
[01:15.940 --> 01:20.020]  me. Oh, well can we talk about why you're not high? Yeah, yeah, no, no. Go for it. Paul
[01:20.020 --> 01:24.340]  happens to be on probation because he was a bad little boy. I was. Got himself in trouble.
[01:24.340 --> 01:27.900]  We won't talk about what he did because I don't even know. I killed a man just to watch
[01:27.900 --> 01:32.580]  him die. Nice. I heard there's a song somebody wrote about you. I don't remember. Maybe Jim
[01:32.580 --> 01:34.780]  Cash. I'm not sure. Jim Cash? Is that who it was? I never heard of him. I thought it
[01:34.780 --> 01:40.940]  was Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey wrote a song. Okay. I like it. So before we go down this road,
[01:40.940 --> 01:45.260]  I want to warn everybody listening. These men are comedians and this could be a funny
[01:45.260 --> 01:48.540]  episode. You never know what's going to come out of these boys mouths. If you've listened
[01:48.540 --> 01:52.100]  to previous episodes with Clint, they've already got funny shit to say because I didn't see
[01:52.100 --> 01:56.140]  him already holding back jokes. If you've listened to any previous episodes with Clint,
[01:56.140 --> 01:59.420]  Clint is a jokester. This will be a very entertaining episode. I'll make sure of it. Clint will
[01:59.420 --> 02:04.140]  make sure of it. Paul will make sure of it. Since we're talking that you guys are comedians,
[02:04.140 --> 02:08.400]  let's just drop a plug right away. Where can the kind folks of Pueblo or Colorado see you?
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.440]  This will come out like the second week of April. So you're going to have to plan your
[02:12.440 --> 02:19.440]  plugs in advance. Well, you can see us every, every Thursday at the rainbow for the Wild
[02:19.440 --> 02:25.000]  Cousins comedy open mic. That's in Pueblo on Santa Fe. The rainbow bar. April 7th. We
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.080]  have a show also at the rainbow for $5. You can see Mary Mack who has been on a bunch
[02:30.080 --> 02:36.360]  of stuff. She's been on a last comic standing and a bunch of different comedy festivals.
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.760]  Apparently she did a voice on a Aqua teen hunger force. So what's she on Aqua teen?
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.240]  Do you know? I have no idea. Was she Carl? Yes. Yes. I think so. I think she, uh, that
[02:46.240 --> 02:53.240]  time they had rush on there. She played Getty league. Nice. Nice. That's April 7th. Uh,
[02:53.240 --> 02:58.240]  she's coming with her husband who has been on Letterman. I spacing the name right now,
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.760]  but you should just come check it out and come check us out every Thursday at the rainbow.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.800]  Yeah, this will come out the day before that. I think the, so I think those come out the
[03:06.240 --> 03:08.360]  sixth. I'm looking at my phone right now trying to find the calendar. So you have a seventh.
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.080]  You guys go tomorrow night. If you're listening to this on the sixth, go to the rainbow bar.
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.320]  It's in Pueblo. Um, I have a friend who thought that was in Colorado Springs that they drove
[03:16.320 --> 03:20.240]  to Colorado Springs. What up? They look for the rainbow bar. Yep. And they realized that
[03:20.240 --> 03:23.140]  it's in Pueblo. So they drove back home and by the time they got there, I think they missed
[03:23.140 --> 03:28.120]  your show. Yeah. Well that happens. It's all right. It's free every week. Come down. Um,
[03:28.120 --> 03:33.200]  it's, it's a really nice room to comedians get free pizza and a free drink. So that's,
[03:33.320 --> 03:36.640]  what qualifies me as a comedian? Do I open tell a joke? Yeah. Just get up there and tell
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.600]  a joke. Get some pizza. There we go guys. Come to open Mike night at the rainbow and
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.360]  a free beer. Uh, yeah, yeah. And a free beer soda. You can have my free beer if I go get
[03:45.360 --> 03:50.040]  one. Yeah. Cause I don't need the beer. Yeah. Awesome. Same here. Actually. No, you're drinking
[03:50.040 --> 03:54.200]  again. Aren't you? I don't drink. What? Two men in the room that three men in the room
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.400]  that don't drink. Alcohol does not agree with me. I do stupid shit and so I don't do it.
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.400]  I'm allergic to alcohol. I break out in handcuffs and fat chicks. Yeah. I just get real. I get
[04:04.400 --> 04:07.840]  really angry and I say stuff that I don't mean, but I do that sober so I don't know
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.920]  if that's how it just like multiplies. It gives it another level. Yeah. It's it all
[04:12.920 --> 04:16.040]  out. All right. Uh, before we go too far, I should do the commercials because we're
[04:16.040 --> 04:19.640]  going to get into this conversation. I can already tell a huge, huge shout out to burn

[05:22.000 --> 05:26.200]  going to let that fly and I want to say it was that one time we're flyering out of college.
[05:26.720 --> 05:30.560]  That makes you the red wiggler bro. Yeah. I'm down. It sounds like a wrestler name.
[05:30.560 --> 05:37.600]  That sounds like a, my dog on his back. That's a red rocket. That's a little different. I'm
[05:37.600 --> 05:42.440]  skipping this. Okay guys, this red rocket has been brought to you by the Rocky mountain

[06:27.000 --> 06:31.400]  stuff. We've just got fun and games ahead of us now. Woo. Woo. Your comedians tell me
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.240]  a joke. Just kidding. Don't you hate that shit? Did people do that to you? Uh, comedian
[06:36.240 --> 06:40.520]  make me laugh. It happens pretty regularly. It's silly. Cause I still consider myself
[06:40.520 --> 06:48.600]  an open Micah comedian. Comedian is something I aspire to be, but, um, I, I, I, I don't
[06:48.720 --> 06:52.720]  like it. Oh, you're a comedian. Not really. I'm making, I'm not getting paid for this.
[06:52.720 --> 06:57.880]  I'm still a steel worker. I'll also consider myself a comedian or like consider the years
[06:57.880 --> 07:01.800]  I've been a comedian as like as many times as I claim it on my taxes and shit like that.
[07:01.800 --> 07:06.160]  Nice. Okay. That's fair enough. Respectable. When you actually start getting like booked
[07:06.160 --> 07:10.760]  for gigs and stuff like that, like we're just local feature guys like open, but you've got
[07:10.760 --> 07:15.240]  a lot of hard dude and that's what takes a lot of, a lot of get a lot of it is a lot
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.280]  of heart and that's what you need. A lot of guys are, they just don't have the heart.
[07:18.280 --> 07:21.040]  They want to go up there and repeat the same shit every week and you can tell there's doing
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.800]  it to just do it. You guys got the heart. You're putting in work. It's a way for me
[07:25.800 --> 07:31.520]  to get all the negative shit I'm feeling about myself out. And if I can make people laugh
[07:31.520 --> 07:36.280]  from it, then it kind of validates all the shitty things that I've ever done. Well, Paul,
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.960]  that's kind of a self-righteous way to look at it. It's very personal. I'm not doing it
[07:41.960 --> 07:46.720]  for anybody else. The way, the way Paul does his comedy is self deprecatingly. Yeah. So
[07:46.720 --> 07:51.680]  like it, yeah, it might sound like, Oh, this is, he's doing it for himself and it is, but
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.800]  it's also like, I need to tell you this. Yeah. It's a healthy way to get shit out. It's way
[07:56.800 --> 08:00.080]  cheaper than a therapist. And if you're making me laugh, we're both getting therapy out of
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.280]  it. So that's pretty cool. And, and if, and, and a lot of the guys will, you know, we're
[08:04.280 --> 08:08.440]  all, we're always trying new stuff. There's only a few guys that, you know, kind of have
[08:08.440 --> 08:15.480]  fallen into a trap of not doing new stuff fairly regularly. But, um, it's, it's fun
[08:15.640 --> 08:21.080]  to see like when a joke can fail too. And you can see what he wanted to do with it. And
[08:21.080 --> 08:25.760]  it's like, damn dude, like if you'd have twisted this, that joke would have worked. It's neat
[08:25.760 --> 08:30.520]  seeing that stuff. So you get to see like the initial and like, why didn't that work?
[08:30.560 --> 08:34.520]  And then you talk about it and Oh, okay. And you get to see it the next time he does it.
[08:34.520 --> 08:38.680]  And he's got a little bit more confidence because he's done it once. Like open mic comedy
[08:38.680 --> 08:44.960]  is so fun to watch as an art form, not just the comedy that you're watching, but the comedy
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.920]  is like the reason you're putting butts in seats. But for us to watch guys evolve and
[08:50.920 --> 08:56.440]  get better and like, um, perfect case in point was Dan Rainey. Absolutely. I've heard a lot
[08:56.440 --> 09:02.720]  about Dan Rainey. He was, he was, he was really not good when he started and, but he went
[09:02.720 --> 09:09.480]  from not good and he was okay, but he just, now he's good. And it came fast. It went a
[09:09.480 --> 09:15.680]  lot easier for him to go from not good to like good. I think confidence had a lot to do
[09:15.680 --> 09:18.960]  with that. His, his material I thought was always funny. It's just when he told it, he
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.000]  was kind of unsure about it and you can't really be sure. It took a lot to get him started.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.200]  Didn't it? Just to get him up. Yeah. Just to get him on stage. Like he'd been coming to
[09:26.200 --> 09:32.240]  comedy shows since like six months. I first started doing comedy and he was just so scared
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.200]  to get up on stage and tell a joke. And then he finally did it. And for some people, once
[09:37.200 --> 09:40.640]  you do it, that just opens up the floodgates. You can't stop doing it. Well, I'll admit
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.800]  it. Uh, as I was a teenager, I've watched comedy. You can tell from talking to me and
[09:44.800 --> 09:47.840]  I've been into comedy as long as you guys have. I'm not, but I've been in that club
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.760]  and I would love to walk up on stage and throw down one good set. And I've got a podcast.
[09:52.760 --> 09:56.360]  I'm obviously okay with talking in a group. We do grow meetings where I just run my mouth
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.840]  and talk about growing. Dude, I get, I just thinking about going up there to do a set.
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.200]  No thank you. I want to shit my pants. It scares the shit out of me. That's the other
[10:05.200 --> 10:09.760]  part of it. I know I can't, I can't say I can't do it, but I know that that's not my
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.440]  wheelhouse. Yeah. It's just weird for me to even think about getting up there. But at
[10:13.440 --> 10:16.920]  the party or whatever, I'll, I'll tell everybody a joke all day long. That's the other part
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.160]  of it. When you get up there and you really feel like you have something to say and you
[10:21.160 --> 10:24.680]  want to tell these people something and they don't laugh at all. It's so heartbreaking.
[10:24.680 --> 10:29.540]  Yeah. Yeah. But that's all crushing. But that's, that's the thing that I like watching and
[10:29.540 --> 10:34.080]  other guys and in myself is you watch these guys. Like I was trying to get to with Dan
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.360]  is like he evolved and you could see that evolution every step and it was neat. And
[10:38.360 --> 10:42.440]  I think that, um, you know, there's guys that don't want to come out to shows all, they
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.040]  tell the same jokes or something like that, but it's like, no, like look at the new thing
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.240]  that he did to the end. I don't know. Like I know that we're probably getting pretty
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.440]  deep on like, Oh no, it's like writing. It's like getting tailoring that, that joke. It's
[10:54.440 --> 10:57.480]  I, well I understand what you're saying and it does, it's not something, it's like making
[10:57.480 --> 11:00.880]  a recipe. Perfect. The first time you make that recipe, it was too spicy, but you knew
[11:00.880 --> 11:04.680]  what you're aiming for. He took out a little spice, added more garlic. It's like watching
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.160]  and I've seen you do it. I've watched your joke telling evolve, not just your jokes get
[11:09.160 --> 11:12.440]  better, but your approach to telling a joke. You don't have to get naked to have a punchline
[11:12.440 --> 11:15.760]  anymore because your jokes have some body to them. Keep your clothes on. That was a
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.080]  long time ago. That was one of the best bits I've ever seen. Hey, thanks buddy. Yeah, that
[11:20.080 --> 11:28.000]  was amazing. Jesus. I'm going to do that joke for everybody right now. Yeah, I get it. Cause
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.440]  it's a visual bit and it works out. And that's how that's going to fail as a joke. I'm looking
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.880]  for Dan Rainey's Twitter feed so that we can get him some Twitter. Dan, at Dan champion.
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.640]  There you go. Look for at Dan champion. Just follow him randomly. He'll have no idea why
[11:42.640 --> 11:46.040]  he got a bump on Twitter. He's a really funny guy coming out of the springs. There's a few
[11:46.040 --> 11:49.960]  funny, funny people coming out of the springs, but I think he's one of the funnier ones.
[11:49.960 --> 11:54.840]  Definitely. And he's really working at it and it's neat to see that. So it's, it's definitely,
[11:54.840 --> 11:58.800]  uh, it's, it's like having a second job when you're not getting paid for it. You're not
[11:58.800 --> 12:02.280]  getting paid for it. Yeah. You're not getting, but it doesn't it. I'm a musician and I've
[12:02.280 --> 12:05.680]  gone and played free shows and just that, I know that feeling of just locking in with
[12:05.680 --> 12:09.960]  the bass player and getting the song right. That that was worth my setup time. My couple
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.800]  hours on stage. Yeah. Oh, for sure. To drive to wherever and go do 15 minutes is, is really
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.000]  nice. Sometimes five. Yeah. You'll drive up to go do five. You'll do 10, you know, you'll
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.840]  do 15 just because they're, they're like, Oh, you drove from Pueblo. Cool. Like, do
[12:27.840 --> 12:33.440]  you have 15 minutes now? Yeah, probably. I don't know. I think I can get about 15 with
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.400]  all of my material, but I don't use a lot of old stuff. Are you exploiting your jail
[12:37.400 --> 12:42.800]  experience for material? I have. Okay. I would definitely have some, a jail material and
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.240]  a recent breakup. You should write a joke about I did not get raped. I'm offended. Well,
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.160]  I did get raped. Okay. First of all, my comedy is very personal. Like I have to be 100% honest
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.760]  with my writing and my comedy because I feel like that's the only way that I can really
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.040]  find my own voice. Cause I'm still looking for it. I don't really know what I'm exactly
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.600]  doing yet. I just write from what I'm still confused if you did or did not get raped because
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.600]  you're a comedian and it's awkward over here a little. I didn't quit winking after you
[13:10.600 --> 13:15.680]  say I didn't. Yeah, this is weird. Surprisingly not touching my leg while you do it. Not a
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.200]  lot of rape in PCJ. Uh, I did, I did have a friend who was in there who was apparently
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.480]  someone's bitch and that made me feel a little weird just to like, just to see that. But
[13:25.480 --> 13:28.160]  guys, we are going to talk about weed in this show too. It's not just going to be prison
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.440]  sex the whole time. Nope. There wasn't, there wasn't any sex or anything, but he would give
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.040]  them like foot rubs and clean his clothes and like they would share commissary. Yeah,
[13:37.040 --> 13:43.080]  it was weird. There was like these weird family rules that are assigned to you when you're
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.440]  in jail for like a considerable amount of time. And I was only in there for 16 days,
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.360]  but I still got assigned a certain role for a thug like you. I bet that 16 days is just
[13:51.360 --> 13:58.360]  for a bitch like me. That 16 days was the worst 16 days of my life. Hashtag man boobs
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.920]  by, by a day six. He was the ad a BC. Oh, so you were, you were about to tell me which
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.960]  or what your role was. I want, I want to hear that. My role was a story time. I would, I
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.920]  would tell stories at night so people can go to sleep cause they couldn't sleep after
[14:13.920 --> 14:17.720]  a while without hearing some kind of story. And it didn't get raped. And when you talk,
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.680]  everyone falls asleep. Nobody liked you in jail. Oh, people loved me in jail. I had kosher
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.040]  trays that I would trade for paper cause I didn't have any money on my, on my, uh, my
[14:28.040 --> 14:34.840]  books or anything like that. So I found out a like Nazis will fucking give me their, you
[14:34.840 --> 14:40.720]  know, teenage daughters for some Jew peanut butter. They don't give a fuck. All right.
[14:40.720 --> 14:44.680]  And I got fresh fruit. That was cool. Yeah. That's what I need if I'm in jail. That's
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.720]  definitely what I want. I only did 15 days and that was almost 10 years ago. So that
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.720]  was a long time ago. I don't have any jail stories. Yeah, either do I. I'm proud of us.
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.400]  Let's behave ourselves. Yeah. No more jail. No more jail. That's why I'm doing it right.
[14:59.400 --> 15:03.320]  Not without the cannabis is legal in Colorado. I'm, I don't do anything that would even like
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.920]  make me worth being in trouble. That was the only thing I ever did was smoke too much weed
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.600]  and just dab out all day. No one can worry. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Come to Colorado. We'll
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.520]  see. We'll see. Or my, my advice since Colorado is getting full and it's getting expensive
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.840]  to rent a house here, uh, make cannabis legal where you are. You can do that there too.
[15:21.840 --> 15:25.320]  Yes. Don't have to come. Oh, you can. I mean, it's cool if you're hot and you wear yoga
[15:25.320 --> 15:29.240]  pants, come here. But like if you're just coming here just to grow some weed, if you're
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.840]  easy, if you're easy and you don't mind a fat chubby guy on top of you, definitely come here.
[15:36.360 --> 15:41.000]  That's a sales pitch. You cannot argue with right there. I like it. Fat chubby. I'll get on top of
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.080]  you. I'll smother you all night long. I won't get on top of you. If you're really scared,
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.600]  you can get on top of me. And it's like, it's like, you know, a fun air mattress with a penis.
[15:51.960 --> 15:56.360]  It's like the little blow up nub on the air. Exactly. All right. I want to read a news
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.920]  article because Clint actually told me that he had a question for me and I'm going to my text
[16:00.920 --> 16:07.240]  message to try to remember what that question was. Was it Jamaica? Yes. Yes. Um, and I also
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.880]  about using cannabis as a sacrament. We talked a little bit about Jamaica, uh, legalizing cannabis
[16:11.880 --> 16:17.640]  for medical use on a past episode. It was either the last one or the one before. Um, and they also
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.320]  have made it, it used to be, if you were caught with any cannabis in Jamaica, it would be a seven
[16:21.320 --> 16:27.000]  day sentence in a Jamaican jail. And it's nothing like the little luxury condo that you just spent
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.560]  some time in. It would be a Pueblo County jail. No, but I've heard some good stories.
[16:32.120 --> 16:37.160]  It's the, everyone in their trade stories of like where to get arrested. It's like,
[16:37.160 --> 16:42.760]  you got to go to Crowley County. They have carpet, but like apparently Pueblo County jail
[16:42.760 --> 16:47.240]  is the worst facility in the state. Wow. Well, I would believe that. Yeah. Well then the Jamaican
[16:47.240 --> 16:52.040]  jail is it's still going to be worse. Yeah, of course. But, uh, so, and now in Jamaica,
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.640]  if you get caught with cannabis, it's just a fine, you don't go to jail right away. It's like a $200
[16:55.640 --> 17:00.280]  fine if you have less than an ounce. So now guys like us can go. And also they've made it to where
[17:00.280 --> 17:05.320]  if you have a medical marijuana card in the States, you can go there and register your medical
[17:05.320 --> 17:11.560]  marijuana card for a small fee and get a pass to buy medical marijuana while you were in Jamaica
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.880]  from their stores. Yeah. I heard their weed sucks though. It's not going to now because a lot of
[17:15.880 --> 17:20.440]  people from the United States saw this coming, that cannabis was going to be legalized. And I
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.680]  have friends in the industry that have already flown down there and set up shops and testing labs
[17:24.680 --> 17:29.640]  and BC bubble man was down there teaching everybody how to make good hash. So it's going
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.080]  on down there. Yeah. So that's kind of, kind of what I can tell you about Jamaica without talking
[17:35.080 --> 17:39.480]  too much about what we said on another episode. But then you asked me, ironically, you said,
[17:39.480 --> 17:45.480]  how about using a cannabis as a sacrament? And then today I look at the cannabis and there it's
[17:45.480 --> 17:50.680]  the news page. I check out the cannabis. Their headline is new in Indiana, a cannabis church
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.320]  gets its chance. Yeah. I think that's where I got that idea for that question. Nice was
[17:56.040 --> 18:03.080]  because Indiana passed that law that allows people to discriminate against gays. Like now,
[18:04.280 --> 18:09.880]  like as a part of religion, is it okay to smoke weed there? And it has to be because they can't
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.360]  tell you what to do by that law. If you're going to uphold one, you got to uphold the other. I'll
[18:14.360 --> 18:17.720]  read the whole article here. The sub headline says, if someone is smoking in our church,
[18:17.720 --> 18:22.680]  God bless them. Church founder, bill Levin says, this is a church to show a proper way of life,
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.560]  a loving way of life. We're all called canatarians. I don't know how I feel about
[18:27.560 --> 18:31.320]  the word canatarians, but okay. They all wear Reeboks and drink the punch. That's really
[18:31.320 --> 18:35.880]  interesting. I actually have something cannabis related to add to that. Let's hear it before we
[18:35.880 --> 18:42.840]  get into the article. The, uh, a lot of Jews smoke pot and they smoke weed. And a lot of them,
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.920]  especially now with like the younger, like more alternative Hasidic groups that are coming up,
[18:46.920 --> 18:52.200]  like in New York, like the non-ox and everything like that. They, uh, they use it as a sort of
[18:52.200 --> 18:58.280]  way to go back to their cultural roots. Uh, the holy anointing oil had, um, uh, cannabosam in it,
[18:58.280 --> 19:04.680]  which is cannabis. And it had so much in it that it would have psychoactive effects in it. And in
[19:04.680 --> 19:11.240]  other cases, they think that when the high priest would go into a tent to speak to God, they would
[19:11.240 --> 19:18.200]  use, um, things like cannabosam, different other herbs and stuff and incense and olive oil and,
[19:18.200 --> 19:23.080]  uh, the THC oil and everything. And they would just basically hotbox themselves as a way to
[19:23.080 --> 19:29.080]  speak to God. And, uh, Paul's Jewish by the way. Yeah. Very, there's a, there's a book. There's a
[19:29.080 --> 19:34.040]  book about it called, uh, cannabis Hasidim that if anyone's interested, they should definitely check
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.400]  that one out for sure. Myself. I will read that. Yeah. A lot of religions use cannabis. I think,
[19:39.400 --> 19:45.320]  uh, not just the Rastafarians use cannabis. Uh, if, and there's something, even if you're not from
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.840]  part of the world where cannabis was, there is something very similar where you were. And
[19:48.840 --> 19:52.120]  actually cannabis seems to have made its way all the way around the world. So everybody was smoking
[19:52.120 --> 19:56.280]  cannabis, all of the religions, the Saudis have smoked it and the Saudis get overlooked a lot,
[19:56.280 --> 19:59.000]  but yeah, I'm going to read this article. I totally agree with what you're saying. I'm
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.160]  going to read the article. All right. So the article is by Sarah Pulliam Bailey from the
[20:03.160 --> 20:07.160]  Washington post. And it says the first church of cannabis incorporated has been approved by
[20:07.160 --> 20:11.320]  Indiana secretary of state. After the state's religious freedom legislation became law last
[20:11.320 --> 20:16.600]  week, the church's founder, bill Levin said he filed paperwork in a direct response to Indiana
[20:16.600 --> 20:21.560]  governor Mike Pence's signing the religious freedom restoration act into law last Thursday,
[20:21.560 --> 20:26.600]  secretary of state Connie Lawson approved the church as a religious corporation with all the
[20:26.600 --> 20:32.840]  stated intent to start a church based on love and understanding with compassion for all a cannabis
[20:32.840 --> 20:37.160]  is listed as the church's sacrament and its doctrine Levin said, and he will set up a church
[20:37.160 --> 20:42.520]  hierarchy. The church will plan to grow hemp. He said, though they will not buy or sell marijuana.
[20:43.160 --> 20:47.400]  If someone is smoking in our church, God bless them. Levin said, this is a church to show a
[20:47.400 --> 20:52.440]  proper way of life, a loving way of life. We're called canatarians. I wonder if they kind of
[20:52.440 --> 20:57.960]  linked that word from the Rastafarians a little bit. Unitarians, maybe Unitarians, any kind of
[20:57.960 --> 21:04.440]  Arians, huh? Big fan of the area. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure you are. I have a senior swastika tattoo.
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.800]  Oh yeah. I have two. It matches your Hitler mustache. One on each ball. Is that, is that
[21:09.800 --> 21:15.000]  something we're doing here in Colorado? Is there those sex up? Like there's actually green faith
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.960]  ministries, which is a cannabis related church here in Pueblo or it's in Denver. I think they're
[21:19.960 --> 21:25.720]  in Greeley or Gree. I think they're in Greeley. There was a group in Springs when my old band
[21:25.720 --> 21:29.960]  Stem Beach soul revival, check them out on Facebook. I think they're still doing stuff.
[21:29.960 --> 21:38.200]  They're doing stuff. We played a dab party at a hookah bar in Pueblo. Yeah. And there was a guy
[21:38.200 --> 21:44.120]  who was out there handing out like sacramental joints and stuff like that. Yeah. I actually took
[21:44.120 --> 21:50.680]  about an ounce of hash and dabbed everybody out. That was a fun night. Yeah. That was the first
[21:50.680 --> 21:56.200]  time I ever dabbed. Was it the last time? It wasn't the last time I dabbed a few times on here,
[21:56.200 --> 22:02.280]  but that was a long time ago. I got him so high here to get up and leave. And then John Bueno
[22:02.280 --> 22:06.680]  turned as wide as the walls. Yeah. Was it John Bueno? Yeah. I think John Bueno took a dab and
[22:06.680 --> 22:12.280]  turned his wife. No, I don't think he smokes. I think it was Luke Cowie. Wasn't it? No, Previn.
[22:12.280 --> 22:15.480]  It was Previn. There's been so many people at this table that we've dabbed out that have just
[22:15.560 --> 22:21.320]  calling people out. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Dabs. I don't know how I feel about dabs.
[22:22.840 --> 22:27.480]  Dabs do Jeff. Jabs look like drugs. Oh, it does. I'm sure when you break out a blow torch and you
[22:27.480 --> 22:30.680]  start heating that shit up, I'm sure it does. It looks like drugs. Yeah. Guys, when you're
[22:30.680 --> 22:33.640]  dabbing somewhere, just, just remember that, that you're using a torch and it looks like we're
[22:33.640 --> 22:38.120]  heating up some crack. It seriously does. So like if people are discriminating against you for doing
[22:38.120 --> 22:46.040]  dabs, I am too, because it looks like drugs. You guys are ruining weed. It's too much. It's too
[22:46.040 --> 22:52.680]  much for me. Like I know like it's supposedly cleaner, right. Then smoking the actual leaf.
[22:52.680 --> 22:55.960]  Yeah. There's less crap that you're smoking. You're smoking the more like pure form of it
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.200]  and all, but it just fucks me up so much. Well, don't they do it like a different method now?
[23:00.200 --> 23:03.480]  Yeah. There's no butane. Yeah. The method you're probably talking about is Rosin tech,
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.200]  where we're just using a pressing comb, like a straightening iron, squeezing the juice out of the
[23:08.200 --> 23:12.600]  bud by that way. But with the BHO, the butane, there's no butane left in our product. We're,
[23:12.600 --> 23:16.920]  uh, we're getting it clean. We figured out how to clean it out real well. That's good. You are.
[23:16.920 --> 23:21.560]  Yeah. I smoke cigarettes, so I don't really care about butane or anything like that. I put
[23:21.560 --> 23:25.960]  horrible things into my body. Yummy. And that's a shout out to cigarettes. I don't know if you
[23:25.960 --> 23:29.800]  guys ever smoked those before, but give them a try. They're fun. We had to talk about that on
[23:29.800 --> 23:34.040]  a previous episode. Uh, there were three guys in the room. I took like a half gram dab and didn't
[23:34.040 --> 23:37.800]  choke. And the other two guys are cigarette smokers and they took little tiny dabs and had to get up
[23:37.800 --> 23:41.720]  and leave so they could go hockaloogies and die for a minute. So if you want to take fat dabs,
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.160]  if you want to do big hikes, if you want to go high in elevation, if you want to live long,
[23:45.160 --> 23:49.240]  don't smoke. If you want to be a productive, good human being, don't smoke cigarettes. Yeah.
[23:49.240 --> 23:52.440]  I'm not one of those people though. They're nasty. Also, if you don't want to get old,
[23:53.160 --> 23:57.640]  smoke cigarettes. I don't really, I don't really care. No, I'm not. I don't want you to get old
[23:57.640 --> 24:05.080]  either. Well, yeah. Old saggy tits. Hey, I'm losing. I lost 38 pounds since I went into jail.
[24:05.960 --> 24:11.320]  Yeah. So I'm losing these, losing these man tits. There you go. Ladies, less fat. Come on.
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.960]  Still all the funny, half the fat. Still fat, but less this time, which is really like,
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.400]  I wish all my ex girlfriends would come back. Cause I think this is the, like the least amount
[24:21.400 --> 24:26.360]  I've weighed in my whole life. So I feel like Paul, uh, has a few things he needs to get off
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.240]  his chest because he keeps going back to a specific topic. No, no, no, no, no. That's three
[24:31.240 --> 24:35.960]  times. This is my, this is my, my entire spectrum of ex-girlfriends. I want to give them a chance
[24:35.960 --> 24:40.600]  to come fuck me again now that I'm better looking. So if any of you out there ever hear this and you
[24:40.600 --> 24:47.080]  want to come back, I'm, it's, I'm more active, I'm more attractive. So, you know, it's, it's really,
[24:47.080 --> 24:50.440]  you know, up to you. And he's kind of thug now. Cause he spent some time in the slum.
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.240]  A little thug. I met, I made a lot of friends in there who want me to do nefarious things for them.
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.320]  I'm sure. Oh yeah. Cause they can't wait to get out and get back into trouble. Yeah, exactly.
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.920]  His eyebrows say thug life. He's got a 13 tattooed on the inside of his lip.
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.400]  It looks good with your teardrop tattoo. I, uh, I heard a lot of fucked up stories from
[25:09.400 --> 25:14.760]  Mexican cartel guys. Like this one kid that I was in there with, he's not a kid, he's like 25,
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.080]  but, uh, he apparently fucked two chickens to death when he was like 13 in Mexico.
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.240]  All right. I'm going to keep reading this article from the campus. It says marijuana
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.320]  is currently illegal in Indiana for both medical and recreational use. So the church could test
[25:27.320 --> 25:33.960]  the application of the new law. Uh, RFRA prevents Indiana's government from substantially burgeoning
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.160]  a person's exercise, exercise of religion. If it can demonstrate that it is at least the risk.
[25:40.280 --> 25:43.880]  Let me try that again. Cause I'm still fucked up from what Paul just said. If it can demonstrate
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.600]  that it is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.840]  Just the best segue of ever. When we asked him why he did it, he just said, uh, cause it's Mexico.
[25:56.520 --> 25:58.600]  So Mexico, you have some explaining to do.
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.240]  Did he behead the chicken? No, if they ate him or what? He was like,
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.320]  that egg came out of that hole. That egg is about that. So look what I could do.
[26:09.320 --> 26:13.640]  It seems like a waste of chicken. It was all hungry when he was done. Did he eat it afterwards?
[26:13.640 --> 26:18.760]  That's what we asked when he said no, that was gross. That's what's gross about that story.
[26:21.160 --> 26:27.080]  He's a interesting character. All right. So 11 who spoke to the post by phone said the church.
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.240]  Yeah, this is from, is from Indiana. This part, Paul's part is from Mexico.
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.240]  Uh, 11 who spoke to the post by phone said the church has received $2,000 in donations and
[26:35.240 --> 26:40.600]  received more than $7,000 or 7,000 Facebook fans in the five days that it has existed.
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.640]  He hopes to build the first church or temple built of hemp Crete,
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.080]  a building material similar to concrete. Well, that includes hemp. That's cool.
[26:47.800 --> 26:51.560]  I've heard a lot about hemp Crete and I think it's amazing. Yeah, it'll work. We need to start
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.640]  using this more. Yeah. And industrial hemp is a good idea. And especially since we can now grow
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.640]  hemp in the United States. What are they doing? Just taking rocks out and creating, putting hemp
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.360]  in instead of concrete. You know, I don't know how they make concrete, so I don't want to sound
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.000]  stupid and try to act like that's exactly how they do it. I don't know. I don't know either.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.600]  I'm sure they're using some kind of cannabinole as like the powdery agent.
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.720]  It's apparently like extremely fire resistant. Like, so your houses won't burn down and if it
[27:19.720 --> 27:24.760]  does, it'll smell real good. Smell really good. I like, I like how we're two capable white men and
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.840]  we don't know how to make concrete. Like we should know. You should know you're a steelworker. I
[27:28.840 --> 27:32.920]  should know. I'm a little mad about it. I guess. Yeah. Like Ross DeFarian. All right. He might not
[27:32.920 --> 27:37.880]  know how to make concrete. That guy that makes rebar probably seems like a hobby of yours. Like
[27:37.880 --> 27:51.680]  I'll make concrete on the side. Just whip it up a batch of Crete. That's fantastic.
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.600]  Wait for Adam Carolla to come over so we can hang some drywall. Oh, we're he's, you know,
[27:57.600 --> 28:04.640]  we're looking at those choices and it is Adam Carolla. Fix your fucking eyebrows, bro. Oh God.
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.480]  What do you think he has tattooed under there? Oh man. You just threw him out.
[28:09.440 --> 28:19.520]  This is his love line. You know, I like, I like the thick eyebrows is in with girls today. Cause
[28:19.520 --> 28:24.080]  I love thick eyebrows. I hated the really thin, shallow eyebrows. Just pencil them in real good.
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.960]  Yeah. That's not how she's a sharpie. You know, by the, the, the, the prettiness of the girls I'm
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.400]  looking at, like the eyebrows is not what I'm concentrating on. I know that's not what you're
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.800]  concentrating on. I like, I like a nice face. If she doesn't have a mustache, Clint's excited.
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.520]  Hey, you shaved your arms. Sweet. I'm okay with a mustache. As long as it, you know,
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.560]  I can grow a better one. Then it's okay. I'm going to read some more of this article. So
[28:47.840 --> 28:52.160]  we are progressing. I don't don't ever stop. I just want to get through this one article through
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.800]  the whole 45 minute show. And I'll be happy with life. We're progressing to get a building property
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.600]  to be our Holy ground. He said, we're going to set up counseling for heroin service. And we have a
[29:01.600 --> 29:06.000]  huge epidemic in this country. We'll probably have alcoholics anonymous too. I'm not going to
[29:06.240 --> 29:12.400]  alcohol on the premise. Levin also wrote out the new DD dozen 10 commandments, like a,
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.440]  10 commandments like list with suggestions for better living. Sorry. I'm laughing at this article
[29:17.440 --> 29:22.560]  and you guys, while I'm trying to read the Bibles of other religious religions are yesteryear about
[29:22.560 --> 29:27.680]  the drinking out of goat skins. What about drinking out of goat skins? That doesn't relate
[29:27.680 --> 29:32.720]  to the people with GPS in their hand and 7,000 tunes in that same hand. He said, the church is
[29:32.720 --> 29:36.800]  very simple. The first good book we're going to ask partitioners to read and understand is the
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.480]  emperor wears no clothes. So it kind of feels to me like this guy's copying that church on weeds.
[29:42.480 --> 29:48.240]  Remember that church on weeds? Oh, I didn't watch weeds. I watched a TV show. Yeah. That's a good
[29:48.240 --> 29:52.720]  TV show. It was good. Well, I remember that up until Nancy got shot and then I was like, Oh,
[29:52.720 --> 29:58.400]  spoiler alert. Yeah. If you haven't fucking watched that, I'm going to spoil the whole thing.
[29:58.400 --> 30:03.200]  The last episode of weeds definitely made me tear up though. That was a really good season finale
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.160]  finale. I don't remember that part. That's really good. All right. More article. He says, I'm very
[30:08.160 --> 30:12.160]  faith driven. I'm very spiritual and I'm filled with love. He said, I find that most religions
[30:12.160 --> 30:16.160]  are misled into gross perversions of what they're meant to be. This path has led me to lead a
[30:16.160 --> 30:20.480]  religion that people in today's world can relate to. We don't have any guilt doctrine built in.
[30:20.480 --> 30:25.760]  We don't have any sins built in. Once the church is established, members will be asked for individual
[30:25.760 --> 30:31.120]  donations of $4 and 20 cents a month. He said, Indiana attorney and political commentator Abdul
[30:31.120 --> 30:35.840]  Hakeem Shabazz wrote the Indiana legislators may have put the state in a position to acknowledge
[30:35.840 --> 30:40.800]  those who profess to smoke pot as a religious sacrament. You see, if I would argue that under
[30:40.800 --> 30:45.280]  RFA, as long as you can show that reefer is part of your religious practices, you got a pretty good
[30:45.280 --> 30:51.200]  shot of getting off scot-free. He wrote, remember under RFRA, the state has to articulate a compelling
[30:51.200 --> 30:57.120]  interest in preventing you from smoking pot. I argue they can't. The church of cannabis is just
[30:57.120 --> 31:03.040]  one test in many under Indiana's new law, which has escalated a national prominence in the past
[31:03.040 --> 31:08.160]  week, raising questions about the future of religious freedom laws and gay rights. So I
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.520]  should recap a little bit. The reason that this is popping up is because in Indiana, they just
[31:13.520 --> 31:20.800]  tried to do some rude shit to gay people, citing the Bible as their reasoning. And then these people
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.760]  said, well, if you're going to cite the Bible for saying the Bible says, I don't even want to get
[31:25.760 --> 31:30.880]  into the Bible. Some folks interpretation of the Bible says that homosexuality is wrong. I'm not
[31:30.880 --> 31:34.000]  going to say if I agree or disagree, I'm going to say that that's what that one book says and what
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.880]  people have read. So since that is a thing, we're also saying that in that same book, they've said
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.800]  that all these herbs are here for us to smoke. We're playing by these rules on the gay thing.
[31:42.800 --> 31:46.240]  We're playing by these rules on the pot thing. Ha ha, we win. That's kind of what this church is
[31:46.240 --> 31:52.640]  trying to do. Sick. Yeah. So I think that's kind of cool. With two Q's sick, gnarly bro.
[31:52.640 --> 31:59.280]  Smoked some weed in church. I want to see a letterman top 10 of his, uh, of like his, uh,
[31:59.280 --> 32:06.000]  do's and don'ts like number one, thou shalt not spill the bong water. Thou shall not. Okay. I hate
[32:06.000 --> 32:13.120]  when people use the old Testament as their sort of, you know, guide to hating on gays and hating
[32:13.120 --> 32:16.720]  on anything. Cause that's where all the anti-gay stuff comes from. It doesn't come from the new
[32:16.720 --> 32:22.640]  Testament. Well, it's all about the cleanliness. And, and the reason why, um, a lot of, uh, people
[32:22.640 --> 32:27.840]  think that they're there, they put the, the anti-gay thing in the old Testament was you're
[32:27.840 --> 32:31.840]  living in a desert. You're living around people who are all trying to kill you. So every baby
[32:31.840 --> 32:36.000]  counts at that point. The old Testament is just a guide in how to survive in the desert.
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.760]  And some religions say that you're not supposed to jerk off because you don't want to waste sperm.
[32:40.160 --> 32:45.280]  Like that could have been re uh, carrying on our religion and our race. It's continuing on our
[32:45.280 --> 32:50.080]  people so we can continue to exist. You're not going to get that chicken pregnant and keep our
[32:50.080 --> 32:56.640]  religion going. We're not, we're not, we're not living in a desert around. We're not living in a
[32:56.640 --> 33:00.160]  desert around a bunch of hostile barbarians who are trying to kill us. We kind of are.
[33:01.120 --> 33:05.600]  In some ways. Yes. I guess. We kind of are just in a little bit different sense than back in the
[33:05.600 --> 33:10.880]  day. Yeah. Well, the world's grossly overpopulated so you can, you can have sex with a guy if you
[33:10.880 --> 33:17.440]  want. Yeah. Yeah. I think you should, you know, do it. Yeah. If you want to do that, go for it. I'm
[33:17.440 --> 33:22.480]  not going to stop you. It's not my business. I've never tried, but I'm open if a, if there's a
[33:22.480 --> 33:26.960]  handsome young guy who wants to take me on a date and Paul, you've put yourself out here a lot on
[33:26.960 --> 33:31.200]  the show. You've hoarded yourself out to the max. Come to my comedy show. My ex girlfriends come
[33:31.280 --> 33:36.720]  fuck me. New girlfriends come fuck me and dudes. I'm getting anyone, you know, I'm just getting
[33:36.720 --> 33:40.480]  weird with life now. Fuck. Sounds good. Live a little, right? Figured it out. Live a little
[33:40.480 --> 33:47.200]  secret to life. Live a little secret to the life. All right. Yeah. I don't know, man. If, if that's
[33:47.200 --> 33:52.880]  something that I don't, I guess I don't feel like it's a like weed sacramental to me, but it's just
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.080]  kind of like a hangout thing to do. I don't even do it every day. Yeah. Yeah. I would much rather
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.520]  go and hang out with somebody, but are you a religious or a spiritual person? Otherwise? No.
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.560]  Okay. No. Do you think it's kind of a way? Do you think it's kind of a way for people to just
[34:09.120 --> 34:14.240]  smoke pot and kind of abuse it in that sense? Absolutely. I think, uh, there are a lot of
[34:14.240 --> 34:20.720]  people. I do it. I do it. Uh, my first stab is medical. That first stab makes my shoulders not
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.600]  hurt. Did I knock myself clean the fuck out a few days ago? Like clean out and the first stab
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.120]  makes that not hurt. A second dab makes me good and high third dab. And I'm just dabbed and having
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.200]  fun. The fourth and fifth dab, that is just me abusing it because I've got a lot of dabs and I
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.160]  like to see how high we can get today. Yeah. But in the morning when I'm here by myself and I need
[34:40.160 --> 34:44.160]  some thinking to do, and I got to clear my head and I got a lot of shit on my mind and the world's
[34:44.160 --> 34:48.320]  going too fast for me to get away from it all. Uh, turn off all the lights, turn off the TV,
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.200]  turn off the phone, turn off the computer, get as silent as I can roll up a big fat spliff of just
[34:53.200 --> 34:58.800]  flowers, just buds, buds that I grew, uh, my own personal hidden away bud that nobody else has
[34:58.800 --> 35:03.840]  access to. Nobody gets to see and roll that up, smoke a big fatty middle finger size joint by
[35:03.840 --> 35:10.480]  myself and close my eyes and just see what I am really thinking. Because sometimes my head's just
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.440]  going too fast to even really hear what I'm thinking. And when I get nice and blazed and
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.960]  just close my eyes and just shut up for a minute and get into that quiet space, oh, that's, that's
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.320]  the truth. It's not, I didn't really, I'm not mad about some Facebook shit. Facebook doesn't matter.
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.960]  Once you close your eyes and go into that bubble, whatever she said on Facebook doesn't matter. That
[35:30.960 --> 35:35.200]  guy talking shit about your Instagram picture, you don't really care. You're, you're missing
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.720]  your favorite TV show. Oh, well you realize like what's inside and it just kind of, it shows me
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.160]  more what I really need to pay attention to. And it kind of calms me down a little bit.
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.000]  See, I felt like I had the opposite thing for me, especially since I haven't been smoking pot
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.440]  and smoking anything or doing anything really for the past like 40 days and 50 days, however
[35:53.440 --> 36:00.400]  many days it's been, is I was definitely abusing it. I smoked too much needlessly just to smoke it,
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.400]  just to see how high I could get, like you're saying. And, uh, I'm going to take a dab right now.
[36:04.400 --> 36:08.960]  It wouldn't, it wouldn't necessarily like clear my mind or help me think straight or anything.
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.800]  It would kind of just make me think in worse ways because I was always second guessing myself and I
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.040]  was just overthinking things and then my brain wouldn't shut off because of it. So now that I've,
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.280]  I haven't been smoking, I felt like it's greatly improved like my writing and just my, my overall
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.240]  sense of being, that was something I wanted to touch on. Uh, kind of changed the vibe a little
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.400]  bit. I know Clint's kind of a, I'm going to call you a lightweight, bro. You smoke weed like a
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.120]  little girl, but you're a cheap date. So I love it. He's a big man too. Yeah. He's so sweet.
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.600]  Bring my own weeds. So that way it's not even like imposing on anybody else. But he showed up
[36:41.600 --> 36:45.760]  with, I smoked your weed and it was tasty. That's some pretty tasty, uh, Bubba Kush. It didn't taste
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.240]  bad. It didn't make my mouth burn and it got me stoned. It was good weed. Good. Uh, he came over
[36:50.240 --> 36:56.480]  and he took one rip off of a pipe. So when you write some comedy, do you like write it when
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.480]  you're straight and then embellish it when you get lit or how does smoking affect your writing?
[37:00.480 --> 37:05.120]  Where does it come into play? No, there's, it's kind of like, uh, there's two clents in that
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.440]  aspect cause there's stone clents and then there's sober clents and, uh, and never the two shall meet.
[37:11.760 --> 37:19.360]  But, um, no, they, uh, stone clink can write some shit. It's fucking some of the shit that comes out
[37:19.360 --> 37:26.560]  that I find in my phone when I sober up is what the fuck was I thinking? Like, this is so weird.
[37:27.280 --> 37:31.680]  And then I see, and I remember what I was trying to do with it, but there's no way I would have
[37:31.680 --> 37:38.000]  ever written that sober. Okay. And, and I, you know, I've, I, I write a lot and in this last
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.160]  month I haven't written a whole lot. I just been taking some time away from comedy just,
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.080]  just to clear my head, trying to get my medications straight, you know, cause I'm
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.920]  on a couple of like antidepressants cause old happy Clint wasn't super happy here recently.
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.280]  So I'm doing group therapy and then seeing a one-on-one. Are you? Yeah. I've been seeing
[37:59.280 --> 38:04.400]  a therapist too. And it's, that's like my favorite time of the week. Like I go talk with the dude for
[38:04.400 --> 38:09.120]  like an hour and he's just like, dude, I got your back. I don't care what you say. Like, and I don't
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.360]  do anything that's terrible, but I don't do anything or I don't feel like I'm doing good
[38:13.360 --> 38:19.200]  enough. Anyway, what I was getting at is like, Oh, I, I feel both ways. I'll get real introspective
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.360]  like you do Jeff. And like, what, what is the problem that I'm feeling? And then deal with it
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.760]  right in that moment. But I've also gotten the way that Paul gets and where it's like, all right,
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.800]  why is that making me feel this way? It's because of this it's because of this, I need to like quit
[38:34.800 --> 38:40.080]  doing everything that I do wrong and only work because I got a 13 year old daughter and I'm
[38:40.080 --> 38:43.760]  afraid she's not going to get to college cause she wants to be a surgeon. Then I start dwelling
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.760]  on that and that freaks me out. Yeah. So, but I get like the super happy way to like, you know,
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.400]  this joke that I wrote this and maybe it's a little bit long, but you go and edit it when
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.120]  you're sober and it's great. And then you tell it when you're so I only, I don't like getting up in
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.640]  front of people stoned because I feel like that's my time to, to be on point. Yeah. Oh yeah, for
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.200]  sure. When you're on the spotlight, you need to be on the spot. I used to do a lot of Mike time high
[39:11.200 --> 39:17.120]  and now that I'm not high, it's I've it's so much better for me. I feel and Doug Benson, bro. I love
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.320]  you, but I'm going to say this out loud. I feel Doug Benson being so high really squishes his
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.960]  comedy. He could be a better performer if he weren't so high. Yeah. Like I could see it. It
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.360]  slows him down. I've seen him forget. I've, I personally have gotten Doug Benson so high
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.560]  before a show that he's just flubbed it complete bits and looked at me and said, Rasta Jeff,
[39:36.560 --> 39:42.480]  you got me way too high. Like he told me on stage that I got him too high. Yeah. Like that's,
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.880]  you'd never see a lot of other comedians. You wouldn't see Bill Cosby doing that. I'll tell
[39:46.880 --> 39:53.120]  you that much. I like the silence that you just brought to the show. I don't know. It's like
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.800]  picking on Bill Cosby. It's like picking on Michael Jackson. Like it's the people have
[39:56.800 --> 39:59.920]  chosen sides. And if you fucking decide which side you're on publicly, then the other side
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.920]  hates you. And I'm just going to stay impartial. I don't care. No, either do I. They're not going
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.680]  to, you got to do what you got to do. They're not going to hate me for hating a rapist, right?
[40:07.680 --> 40:13.120]  Hey, if, if, if him sexually abusing me and gets me a TV spot, I'm there. That's just me. You'll
[40:13.120 --> 40:15.760]  need a couple of, you don't even need to eat the pills. Right? Yeah. A lot of people are going to
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.640]  hate me for that one. Hey, April 7th. What's up April 7th. Come see comedy. Yeah. I'm see comedy.
[40:22.640 --> 40:27.520]  Yeah. I'm on there. And, uh, but don't come for me. Come for Mary Mack and her husband.
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.320]  They're really funny people. Yeah. We'll come for you too. His name is big. His name is big. Does
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.200]  he have a lot of words? A lot of letters in it? It's Tim, Tim something. Uh, they don't,
[40:37.200 --> 40:40.000]  they don't share the same last name. It's probably for entertainment reasons.
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.680]  I don't know what I don't know about all that change in your name stuff. Yeah. Go with your
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.120]  real name. I had a lot more to ask about that, but we got thrown off track and I have no idea
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.160]  what the fuck I was going to say. I got excited. No, I think we were talking about when we were
[40:52.160 --> 40:58.400]  writing and stuff. And, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's both ways though. Like I can be stoned and
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.880]  right, but it, my inspiration just comes from like the weirdest shit. Just man, like watching
[41:04.880 --> 41:10.000]  an infomercial and it's like, what the fuck? Why am I thinking about like this different way to
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.080]  watch YouTube all of a sudden? Yeah. Like it's, it's, that's kind of how I started out with just
[41:16.080 --> 41:22.000]  like trying to write comedy about funny situations or just like little things that I think of. And I
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  can't do that anymore. Now I have to, it's all written about my personal experiences and about
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.760]  like my personal feelings and stuff keeps it better. I think when you're telling like, listen
[41:29.760 --> 41:33.680]  to any artist that's written an album about themselves, it was real. That first album that
[41:33.680 --> 41:38.400]  most people come out with, it's their real life experience. Right. That second and third album,
[41:38.400 --> 41:41.920]  it's studio pressure. And they ran out of life experience because now they're just being a
[41:41.920 --> 41:45.920]  musician or that, or they really took something from that experience and they made another one.
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.000]  But a lot of times, and I'm not trying to say that Montesiyahu's first album live at stuff,
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.240]  blew his load, but you could tell he spent his whole life writing that. And then after that,
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.320]  he's like, Oh, I have to make another album. Shit. Yeah. Well, I feel that way about comedy too.
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.680]  Like you'll see some guys that like their first, like their first comedy special was like, whoa,
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.800]  that's cool. And you knew that they had worked like 12 years to get that just that one hour,
[42:10.800 --> 42:17.360]  30 minutes, 30 minutes. Well, even like they're like, uh, the first time I saw Dane Cook was,
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.800]  I tried so hard not to bring him into this. I mean, he was funny back in the day, back when we
[42:22.800 --> 42:28.560]  were in, in high school and middle school, he was the guy and, and you can't take that away from him
[42:28.560 --> 42:35.120]  for a minute. And I know people say, Oh, he stole jokes from people, but 90% of our dude, I don't
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.920]  know, man. You know, he's yeah, he sold out Madison square garden. So he made comedy blow up.
[42:41.920 --> 42:48.960]  We're still riding his coattails because of him is why like premium blend had him on. And I don't
[42:48.960 --> 42:56.320]  remember a lot of sets other than like him, but you you'll see like he blew up and now we're all
[42:56.320 --> 43:02.000]  riding that coattails. And I don't remember what my point was now. So that's fun. No, but like his
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.280]  first album, that's what I mean is like his first, like 15 minutes. It was like, Oh shit. And now
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.040]  you see him and he's not as funny as like going through the motions. I watched his last special.
[43:13.040 --> 43:17.280]  It was hard to watch, but I could still go back and watch his first special. We're talking about
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.320]  comedy. One of the best comedy specials I've seen in a long time is the bill Burr special. That's
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.800]  in black and white. Fuck. So you get to watch that Paul. I haven't, I haven't seen it. Watch that one.
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.920]  Um, and you guys, sorry, you feel that way? No, that's the name of the, okay. I was like, what,
[43:32.880 --> 43:35.600]  since we're on this, we're not even talking about weed today, guys. We're going to talk a little
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.840]  bit more about comedy. Something we've been watching. Uh, yeah, we're going to, I'm going to
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.160]  talk about Rostan stuff for a second too, on that we've been watching. This is not happening with
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.960]  Ari Shaffir on YouTube. I've watched like all 50 something episodes. You guys check that out.
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.120]  Really? This is not happening. Really funny. Yeah. It's all of it's on YouTube. Go, go to the comedy
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.680]  central YouTube channel. There's a playlist. Just go to number one and click play and watch them all.
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.440]  Uh, Joey Diaz's are the best. Joey Diaz is one of my favorite comedians ever. Uh, Joe Rogan does a
[44:03.440 --> 44:08.000]  couple of great ones on there. Uh, big Jay Oakerson will make you pee your pants laughing.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.120]  I thought Kyle cananes was really Kyle. Kyle canane fan. Uh, who's the guy that got in the
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.360]  fight in a phone booth? I don't remember. Yeah. Well listen, find that one. Clint's mother,
[44:17.360 --> 44:23.520]  I think Clint's mom, Clint's mom's on the show. She won. She won that fight in the phone booth.
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.880]  Since we're talking about comedy, I brought up the event page so I can give everybody the full
[44:26.880 --> 44:33.120]  spiel. Uh, Mary Mack has been on a comedy centrals live at Gotham NBC's last comic standing Montreal's
[44:33.120 --> 44:38.080]  just for last festival on the San Francisco sketch fest and her husband Tim Harmston has
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.640]  been on the Letterman. Oh wow. So we're going to have people that have been on TV. Yeah. There
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.400]  are actual people who have done stuff before and that's a April 7th, Tuesday, uh, the rainbow at
[44:48.400 --> 44:53.120]  9 PM for $5 Pueblo. You're really missing out if you don't go to this one. Yeah. Come on down.
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.920]  You guys, I, there's a good chance I'll be there. It's on Santa Fe. Uh, it's right near the green
[44:57.920 --> 45:02.240]  light. Right up the street from the green light. Cool. Just go check it out and have some laughs,
[45:02.240 --> 45:06.480]  get some drinks. It's a really cool bar. Come eat Paul. Cause we've really described him in a
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.080]  weird way. He's got a Hitler mustache and a teardrop tattoo from our description. I have
[45:10.080 --> 45:15.040]  thug life tattoo to my eyebrows and I'm just desperate, desperate for companionship. Yeah.
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.440]  He's thrown that out there. I wasn't going to remind everybody of that. He needs some,
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.760]  he needs a hug. That's really what he needs. A mouth hug. A mouth on my penis.
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.520]  No matter what you try to do with these boys, it always goes back to a dick joke.
[45:29.520 --> 45:36.720]  Okay. We're not comedians. That's the thing. We're open Micah. Yep. It's all about the mentality,
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.920]  bro. Well, I mean, we treat it serious, but we're not getting paid for this. Yeah. Even all that
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.840]  money that Paul's bringing in, like, yeah, $5 donation. That's not going to Paul. Paul ain't
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.480]  making shit. I'm not, I'm not getting paid at all for this show. Buying pizza and beer for the
[45:50.480 --> 45:56.800]  comedians. We, we actually get sponsored by Paul's pizza and in cannolis in Pueblo, which if you
[45:56.800 --> 46:02.400]  haven't had Paul's pizza, you should definitely go try it. It's on Norwood where the taco Casa is.
[46:02.400 --> 46:08.480]  It's really good. They have like two topping to look at the clock. I'm like large pizzas for like
[46:08.480 --> 46:13.440]  $12. It's really, really good. Guess how fat he is. If he knows the pizza specials guys, you get
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.840]  to guess his weight. They're my sponsor. Guess his weight on Twitter. I know it. Cause I tell people
[46:18.400 --> 46:24.880]  guess his weight on Twitter. And I'm a big fan of pizza. Hashtag 257. That's like what stops me
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.200]  from committing suicide is like, well, you're going to eat pizza again. So just, just make it
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.120]  through tonight. Do you watch, do you listen to that? Uh, Pete Holmes, do you watch, listen to,
[46:33.120 --> 46:39.200]  you made it weird. Uh, it's too long. And I can't, he had Henry Rollins on and he goes, Henry, why do
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.560]  you want people to live longer? And his, he goes two words, more pizza. Henry Rollins is a smart
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.880]  guy. I hated Henry Rollins until I read his book, get in the van. I have so much respect for that
[46:48.960 --> 46:54.960]  after reading that. Put in some work. Yeah. Created the DC scene. He was part of the DC scene. And
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.120]  then, you know, created the LA scene with SST records and black flag. That's crazy. Oh man.
[46:59.120 --> 47:03.360]  You guys should just do a punk rock podcast or some sort of punk rock. Yeah. Well, there you go.
[47:03.360 --> 47:06.960]  We'll do a whole episode. Not a, not this show, but we're going to do another podcast. It's just
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.600]  called punk rock. We'll do one episode. I'm down. It'll go away. Yeah. Like three minutes long.
[47:11.600 --> 47:18.080]  We'll just yell like a sweet punk rock song. No, it'll be a podcast. My favorite band is black
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.320]  flag. And then you scream something obnoxious too. And then we'll punch each other and drink a beer.
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.560]  And then that'll be the end of the show. Yeah. Sounds like a good show. Sounds like a black flag
[47:26.560 --> 47:30.400]  kind of show. Yep. Yep. Yep. Or just punk rock. Mike, when you need them steel toed sneakers
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.960]  steel, that's a cool ass band. I don't know if punk rock Mike can still have the moniker punk
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.440]  rock Mike when he's more of a hobo. I think he should just be hobo Mike at this point.
[47:39.440 --> 47:44.800]  Van by the river, Mike, we're going to put this show back on track. You know, I wanted to relate
[47:45.680 --> 47:51.760]  my ganja meditation to your writing session. Like when you're just being stoned and being goofy,
[47:51.760 --> 47:55.520]  that's you're doing, you're kind of doing the same thing, just in a different way. You're
[47:55.520 --> 47:59.840]  meditating and connecting with yourself the same way I am just still very new at it. Just on a
[47:59.840 --> 48:04.160]  different platform. Oh, that doesn't, I don't think that, I think that there's still more
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.760]  self exploration to do that, that I haven't been willing to do yet. Cause I'm afraid of it.
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.600]  Okay. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. You want to smoke some DMT? No, no, I like DMT. Nice. I would
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.760]  like to smoke some DMT. Paul just lit up. He got a whole new demeanor. His folk life went up on his
[48:21.760 --> 48:28.080]  face. They don't test for DMT. So now I'm just kidding. My probate crystal. I'm just kidding.
[48:28.080 --> 48:37.760]  I would never, I would never do that. Hashtag lighter sounds. Hey, I have to abstain from
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.320]  alcohol and marijuana. They didn't say anything about PCP dimethyltryptamine or ayahuasca was on
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.800]  that list. Now we can't kind of, uh, yeah, we can. I was going to say we can't promote or condone any
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.840]  use of any illicit or psychedelic drugs, but, uh, yeah, fucking, if you have real DMT smoke, DMT,
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.360]  learn about yourself. Get there. That's, that's all I'm going to say about that. We're not going
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.080]  to talk too much about it on the show, but yeah. Wow. Do that. Go there. I'm out. Go there. Do it.
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.600]  Clint. Do that. No, I'm not going to force anybody to do it, but if you're still lightweight, if
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.960]  you're curious, if you have, there's some shit inside yourself that you want to know about and
[49:08.960 --> 49:16.960]  you, you want to get inside your own head or figure out how to stop being such a shitty human being.
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.200]  Take a good blast of DMT and sit back on the couch and close your eyes. I've, uh, the bait,
[49:21.200 --> 49:25.360]  the debate lately has been open her eyes, open or closed eyes. Close your eyes, dude. Get the
[49:25.360 --> 49:29.360]  full experience. Definitely close your eyes. See the color, smell the smells, taste the tastes.
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.160]  Like, Oh yeah. It's like a whole starburst commercial.
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.800]  Yes. DMT flavored starburst. There's nothing like it. All right. Uh, we've got almost an
[49:38.800 --> 49:41.600]  hour guys. I'm not going to edit this at all. I'm going to put this out just like it was. I
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.800]  hope you didn't say anything too stupid. Uh, Oh, uh, you want to, uh, we did a few plugs.
[49:46.800 --> 49:51.760]  What's your Twitter handle? Paul, uh, VHS underscore nerd. I collect VHS tape. So if
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.840]  any of you guys out there want to get rid of your mom's old VHS collection, or if you have an old
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.160]  VHS collection, I definitely love to go through it and take what you don't want.
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.080]  There you go, guys. Do you have a PO box? We could ship those two. No, I'll just come out
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.440]  and take them. Paul will come pick up. He'll drive all the way to Pennsylvania to come pick
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.680]  up your VHS tape. Hit me up on Twitter. Check me out on Instagram, which is just VHS nerd to see
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.680]  all the stuff that I got. And you know, just drop me a line. Nice ladies. Is it hard to find a VCR
[50:17.680 --> 50:23.920]  to play that shit on now? Not really. It's it's the, the whole like VHS thing is starting to get
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.800]  really popular. Cause all the hipsters, I don't even necessarily think it's hipsters. I just think,
[50:28.800 --> 50:35.520]  uh, like a lot of new movies are coming out. Like maniac just got remade. Not recently with, uh,
[50:35.520 --> 50:39.760]  the fuck Frodo Baggins, whatever the fuck that guy's name is. Samwise Gandhi. No.
[50:41.680 --> 50:47.120]  Uh, the fuck's his name. Elijah Elijah would go. I could see him in fucking Wilfred, but I just
[50:47.120 --> 50:51.200]  couldn't think of the name. That was a new movie. That was like a, like a remake that he did that
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.400]  was released on VHS. So there's, there's new, uh, VHS releases. There's also reissues of a lot
[50:56.400 --> 51:01.600]  of old stuff. A company just got done reissuing cannibal Firo and a cannibal Holocaust, which are
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.800]  some Italian, you know, spaghetti splatter movies that are really good. I was waiting for the word
[51:06.800 --> 51:11.440]  of spaghetti splatter to come up. Spaghetti spaghetti horror. Italian horror is where it's
[51:11.440 --> 51:15.360]  at. There's really nothing better than that. Nice. In my opinion. So if you have any Italian horror
[51:15.360 --> 51:19.200]  movies on tape, let me know. I'll take them. Let's get them to Paul. Yeah. Don't you just
[51:19.200 --> 51:22.960]  have an internet connection where you're like, watch stuff? You don't have to. It's not the same.
[51:22.960 --> 51:27.920]  Okay. I agree. No, it's a lot of people like vinyl and they will not use the iPod. So I became a nerd
[51:27.920 --> 51:33.840]  in a video store. That was like my favorite thing to do when my parents would not want to deal with
[51:33.840 --> 51:37.360]  me and they just like, Oh, we'll just take him to the video store so we can rent a movie and a game.
[51:37.360 --> 51:41.920]  And that's where I became a nerd. And like, that's where I first saw my first horror big box and
[51:41.920 --> 51:47.440]  really got intrigued by the cover art by it. And that's really why I, when I go out and I searched
[51:47.440 --> 51:53.040]  through tons and tons of tapes at thrift stores, I see something that I've never seen before, but
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.200]  the cover art's really good, but the movie's fucking terrible. I love it because the cover
[51:57.200 --> 52:02.800]  art's so good and I just love shitty movies. What's the shittiest, what's the best shitty
[52:02.800 --> 52:08.160]  movie you've watched? The best shitty movie is definitely you're the hunter from the future.
[52:08.960 --> 52:15.920]  That is the shittiest fucking movie I have ever seen. It starts out kind of like a fantasy epic
[52:16.480 --> 52:22.240]  where they're fighting dinosaurs and barbarians. And there's a point when he uses, uh, he uses a
[52:22.240 --> 52:27.600]  pterodactyl as a hang glider to kick someone in the face as you do. And then it just segues into,
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.200]  now he's the hunter from the future. So I should have seen this coming. It segues into androids
[52:31.200 --> 52:35.520]  and spaceships and all kinds of shit. It's just the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen. Holy
[52:35.520 --> 52:40.800]  shit. It's amazing though. So if you can check it out, you can actually watch it on YouTube for like
[52:40.800 --> 52:45.680]  $3 is you're the hunter from the future. Or if any girls want to come over to my house or any
[52:45.680 --> 52:50.720]  dudes like we heard earlier. Or any dudes, you know, we'll get weird and it's fine. Come watch,
[52:50.720 --> 52:56.160]  come watch some tapes. Bring your own couch. But it's up there with that one. And then shopping
[52:56.160 --> 53:00.400]  mall. Oh man, I've seen shopping mall. Have you? Shopping mall is fucking great. Years and years
[53:00.400 --> 53:05.120]  ago, like on HBO or Cinemax. It's really bad. Dude, remember USA Up all night? I think that's
[53:05.120 --> 53:09.520]  where I saw shopping mall. That makes sense. I think that's where I saw that shit. It was clean
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.480]  enough to be on USA. Yeah. I was a little, I was a little guy. My mom would watch USA Up all night
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.200]  with me. Probably where we saw it. That's the first time that I saw toxic Avenger. Oh yeah.
[53:19.200 --> 53:24.800]  What's up Toxie? I miss that shit. Love the toxic Avenger. My hero. Nice. Monster hero. Nice. That's
[53:24.800 --> 53:30.640]  on Netflix. Trauma. Yeah. I have it on. I have two copies on VHS. I have an unrated copy and I have
[53:30.640 --> 53:35.600]  a, the edited R rated copy. I was just giving everybody a, an option to go see it. Yeah. If
[53:35.600 --> 53:39.840]  they want to go watch it. If you haven't seen the toxic Avenger and you love pot, you should
[53:39.840 --> 53:44.320]  definitely get really high and then watch the toxic Avenger. You'll laugh your ass off. There
[53:44.320 --> 53:51.200]  you go. All right, Clint, it's your turn. Plugs. Where do we find you? Uh, Instagram and everywhere.
