[00:01.660 --> 00:06.060]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for another episode of the
[00:06.060 --> 00:10.060]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:10.060 --> 00:13.420]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:13.420 --> 00:16.980]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:16.980 --> 00:19.940]  activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of
[00:19.940 --> 00:24.980]  cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me
[00:24.980 --> 00:29.220]  Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. This episode of the
[00:29.220 --> 00:32.740]  podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you
[00:32.740 --> 00:36.180]  need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[00:36.180 --> 00:41.700]  Company. You can find them at dankseed.store. Ladies and gentlemen, roll
[00:41.700 --> 00:45.460]  up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig because
[00:45.460 --> 00:55.220]  it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Welcome
[00:55.220 --> 00:59.020]  back podcast world. It's time for episode 328 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:59.020 --> 01:01.940]  Thanks again for joining me. You know I like to start the show off by letting
[01:02.060 --> 01:06.420]  you know what I'm dabbing. Today I'm smoking Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our
[01:06.420 --> 01:10.500]  friends at Apothecary Farms. If you know me, you know I love the Stardog. I love
[01:10.500 --> 01:14.580]  the aroma, I love the flavor, I love the high, I love the way it grows, and of
[01:14.580 --> 01:19.420]  course I love taking pictures of Stardog. She's a very photogenic strain. So today
[01:19.420 --> 01:23.540]  I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary.
[01:23.540 --> 01:27.300]  Now if you've been following the show lately, you've probably caught the
[01:27.300 --> 01:31.540]  episodes about determining ripeness of your cannabis plants. Then we did an
[01:31.540 --> 01:36.180]  episode about flushing your plants. Then we did an episode about harvesting. Then
[01:36.180 --> 01:39.620]  we did an episode about drying and curing your cannabis plants. Then we did
[01:39.620 --> 01:44.260]  an episode about trimming. Now it is time to clean up the grow room and get
[01:44.260 --> 01:49.820]  restarted for the next cycle. Let's talk a little bit about after harvest cleaning.
[01:49.820 --> 01:55.340]  It sounds pretty basic, but there are a few things you may overlook. Now if you
[01:55.340 --> 01:59.100]  had bugs or powdery mildew, you may want to step up your cleaning product. You may
[01:59.140 --> 02:03.020]  want to step up your cleaning regimen. But if you didn't have any bugs or any
[02:03.020 --> 02:07.220]  issues, I think a light bleach and water solution should work. Or maybe you might
[02:07.220 --> 02:11.860]  want to get yourself some Fizan and use 15 to 20 mils of Fizan per gallon of
[02:11.860 --> 02:16.220]  water. Use that to clean up your whole grow. Either way, whatever product you use,
[02:16.220 --> 02:21.900]  let's clean everything. Let's clean the walls. Wipe down every inch of every wall.
[02:21.900 --> 02:25.620]  Start at one section at the top and just work your way down and to the right. And
[02:25.940 --> 02:29.180]  then just keep going until you've covered every inch of that grow room.
[02:29.180 --> 02:33.580]  Also, if you can reach, scrub the ceiling. If you can't reach, find me. I can
[02:33.580 --> 02:38.300]  probably reach. If not, get a ladder. Scrub the ceiling. Let's clean it with
[02:38.300 --> 02:42.940]  either bleach and hot water or Fizan and hot water and just get anything off of
[02:42.940 --> 02:45.900]  there that may be hiding that we don't want in that grow room. Maybe you've got
[02:45.900 --> 02:48.860]  a spider mite up there chilling out. Maybe you've got a little bit of powdery
[02:48.860 --> 02:52.260]  mildew spore that you don't know about. Maybe there's a piece of pollen up there
[02:52.300 --> 02:56.540]  that you don't know about. Let's clean everything just to be sure. So clean the
[02:56.540 --> 03:02.220]  walls. Clean the ceiling. Clean your light reflectors. Clean the lights. The top of
[03:02.220 --> 03:06.700]  the lights, they're probably dusty up on top. The reflectors, they're dusty on the
[03:06.700 --> 03:10.940]  inside. Clean those things. Take this opportunity while the room's empty and
[03:10.940 --> 03:14.260]  clean everything, you guys. So take the light reflectors down if you think they
[03:14.260 --> 03:19.660]  need some cleaning. Clean them. Hang them back up. Clean your fans. Take the fans
[03:19.820 --> 03:23.820]  off of the wall. Take the little grate off the front. Unscrew the little thing
[03:23.820 --> 03:27.740]  that holds the blades on. Take the blades off. Clean the blades. I know they're
[03:27.740 --> 03:33.340]  dirty. Fans get disgusting. The grate on the back is filled with muck and hair
[03:33.340 --> 03:37.460]  and just weird random gunk that I can't even tell you what it is. Clean that
[03:37.460 --> 03:40.700]  shit out of there. You're probably gonna be disgusted that you've been blowing
[03:40.700 --> 03:45.320]  that shit around in your grow. Clean your fans. While you're cleaning the fans, look
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.680]  at anything that moves air or blows air. Look at the air return on your
[03:49.680 --> 03:53.160]  dehumidifier. That thing's pulling in a bunch of water and a bunch of air and
[03:53.160 --> 03:56.800]  then it's blowing air back out. Does that filter need to be changed? Does that
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.840]  dehumidifier need to be cleaned off? Is the water line that's draining water out
[04:01.840 --> 04:05.760]  of your dehumidifier, is it gunky? Does it need to be cleaned? Is the reservoir
[04:05.760 --> 04:10.520]  that you're draining your dehumidifier water into starting to develop slime and
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.200]  algae? If so, you need to clean that. Stay on top of those sort of things. So
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.280]  clean the walls, clean the lights, clean the fans, clean your dehumidifier, dust
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.280]  everything. The top of everything is dusty. The top of everything is funky.
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.160]  You've been spraying pesticides in there. Imagine you sprayed some sticky pesticide
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.800]  like Azimax in there. Then it got dusty. It's just sticking to the Azimax. It's
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.640]  funky. It's gross. Clean everything. Wipe it and dust the tops of everything. Clean
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.600]  your hydro tables. If you've got tables in the room, clean them. If you've got
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.080]  trays and you can take them outside, take them outside. Spray them down with
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.040]  the hose. If you've got a power washer, hit them with the power washer. If those
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.520]  tables are real dirty, scrub them down with some Fizan. Scrub them down with
[04:52.520 --> 04:55.920]  some bleach. Make sure you rinse them out real good and just get them real clean.
[04:55.920 --> 04:59.180]  You guys, the Fizan is gonna foam up. Be prepared for that. You're gonna make foam
[04:59.180 --> 05:02.360]  with Fizan. And make sure you clean everything out when you're done using
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.880]  cleaning products. Clean out your tables and reservoirs really well if you use a
[05:06.880 --> 05:10.760]  cleaning product. But rinse the shit out of those hydro tables. Rinse the shit
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.000]  out of all your tubing and all of your lines. Clean that stuff so that it's not
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.160]  clogged and so there's no algae in there. Here's something people don't pay enough
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.280]  attention to. Clean the floor. Yes, I know. We just walk on the floor all day, right?
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.760]  Sweep it. Mop it. Clean it up. If you've got some sort of poly film or panda film
[05:28.760 --> 05:32.960]  on the floor, some sort of subfloor, does it need to be replaced? Are there holes
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.880]  in it? Has your poly or your panda film started stretching and getting holes
[05:36.920 --> 05:40.760]  from the staples? Do you need to duct tape some spots? Check that kind of stuff
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.840]  out. Clean your floors. Everything lands on the floor. The floor is gross. Clean it
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.440]  up. Also, here's something I should mention. If you've got light reflectors
[05:50.440 --> 05:54.560]  with glass on them so that they're air-cooled, clean that glass. Take that
[05:54.560 --> 05:59.040]  glass out. Wipe that shit down with some Windex. Let it dry and put it back. Clean
[05:59.040 --> 06:03.920]  the reflector glass. Also, clean all of your air conditioner filters. Check them.
[06:04.080 --> 06:08.240]  Make sure they are clean. If you've got ducting anywhere, check your ducting. Make
[06:08.240 --> 06:11.960]  sure the ducting isn't bent in any weird places. Make sure there are no clogs. Make
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.640]  sure all of your duct is secured. Make sure it's duct taped or clamped
[06:15.640 --> 06:18.440]  somewhere so that the air you're trying to move away from the grow doesn't
[06:18.440 --> 06:22.520]  accidentally end up being blown right where you don't need it. If you've got a
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.280]  leak, that air is just gonna come flying out of there. You may just be moving the
[06:26.280 --> 06:29.840]  heat from the light right back into the grow room. Then your air conditioner has
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.720]  to work harder, and you can't figure out why the room isn't cooling down and it
[06:33.720 --> 06:37.440]  gets frustrating. So check all of your ducting. Check your carbon filter. Is
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.000]  that carbon filter still filtering? Can you smell the herb outside when you grow?
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.440]  Did anybody mention that your harvest stunk really badly? How long have you
[06:46.440 --> 06:50.420]  had that carbon filter? Did you write it down? You should know when that carbon
[06:50.420 --> 06:54.280]  filter needs to be replaced. A lot of the brands say they will last two years. I
[06:54.280 --> 06:59.760]  never believe in that. I've never had a carbon filter last two years. Also, that
[06:59.760 --> 07:03.160]  carbon filter cover. Maybe you're gonna leave that filter there for two years,
[07:03.160 --> 07:07.840]  and it's got that little dust cover on it. Take that ugly thing off, throw it in
[07:07.840 --> 07:12.200]  the washer with some OxiClean, and clean that thing. Nobody wants to see your
[07:12.200 --> 07:18.120]  pictures of your black and gray carbon filter dust cover. That is gross. Also, you
[07:18.120 --> 07:21.600]  guys, get in there and clean out the reservoir. If you've got a reservoir that
[07:21.600 --> 07:25.240]  you mix your nutrients in, or that you use as part of your hydro system that
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.680]  you're pumping your nutrients from right to your plants, clean that reservoir. Why
[07:29.680 --> 07:32.840]  wouldn't you want a clean fresh start? You don't want biofilm and funk in there,
[07:32.840 --> 07:36.800]  because that's going directly to your plants. Also, clean all of the tubing.
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.640]  I've already said that once, but clean it all, because all that gunk will end up
[07:40.640 --> 07:46.240]  into your plants. Another thing we should remember to clean is the emitters. If
[07:46.240 --> 07:49.800]  you've got a hydro system with some sprayers, or emitters, or sprinklers at
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.680]  the end of a line, make sure you pop those emitters off and clean them. They
[07:53.680 --> 07:58.400]  like to get filled with some gunky funk. Now is the perfect opportunity to take
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.720]  all those off and clean them up real well. Another really important thing we
[08:02.720 --> 08:06.400]  can do while we've got the room taken down, we can decide if we need to replace
[08:06.400 --> 08:11.600]  any bulbs. How long have your bulbs been in the grow? Depending on what type of
[08:11.600 --> 08:16.160]  lighting you're using, it may be time to swap out some bulbs. When bulbs get old,
[08:16.160 --> 08:20.400]  they still draw the same amount of electricity, but they do not put out the
[08:20.400 --> 08:24.000]  same amount of light. So you're paying for that electricity, and it is not
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.800]  making it to your plants. So check your bulbs and see if they need to be
[08:27.800 --> 08:31.880]  replaced. A good way to find out if they need to be replaced is to get a lumen
[08:31.920 --> 08:36.880]  meter. A lumen meter will measure how much light is coming from your bulb. If
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.520]  your bulb is putting out less than 75 or 80 percent of its maximum output, it is
[08:41.520 --> 08:45.280]  time to replace it. Now how do you know what the maximum output of that bulb is?
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.600]  The way to find that out is to buy a brand new bulb, put the bulb in your
[08:49.600 --> 08:53.440]  reflector, and turn it on. Then you've got to wait a few minutes and let that bulb
[08:53.440 --> 08:57.080]  get to its maximum brightness. It takes a little while for the bulbs to heat up and
[08:57.080 --> 09:00.560]  get to the right spectrum and get all the way bright. Once it's bright and all
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.240]  the way heated up, go about 12 to 18 inches from that bulb and measure what
[09:05.240 --> 09:08.800]  the lumens are right there and write it down. Write down the date and the amount
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.760]  of lumens. Then check it now when you're cleaning the room. Go the same distance
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.000]  away with that lumen meter and see how many lumens are popping up. If you're not
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.440]  satisfied with the amount of power you're getting out of that bulb, it is
[09:21.440 --> 09:24.960]  time to replace it. If you feel like you're paying for electricity that is
[09:24.960 --> 09:28.880]  not making it to your plants, it is time to replace your bulb.
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.680]  Lumen meters may be expensive, but a lot of times the grow shop will let you
[09:33.680 --> 09:37.960]  borrow one because they know that if your bulbs are bad, you're probably just
[09:37.960 --> 09:42.080]  going to come buy more bulbs when you return the lumen meter. So ask them at
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.760]  the grow store. They may have one available that you can borrow.
[09:44.760 --> 09:49.120]  Alright guys, most of the cleaning stuff should be fairly obvious. Clean the shit
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.800]  out of everything. Scrub everything. If you're gonna put plants in anything that
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.520]  had a cleaner in it, make sure you get that cleaner out. Replace the bulbs.
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.680]  Replace the filters. Some other things we may not remember to think about are
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.080]  check and reset your timers and all of your programs. If you've got your lights
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.240]  on a certain schedule, fix that schedule. If you've got your CO2 or your auto
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.080]  watering on a schedule, make sure you correct that schedule before you put new
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.040]  plants in here. Did daylight savings time happen? Check that. Is the timer on the
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.960]  right time? Is your timer on the right day? A lot of the controllers have a day
[10:22.960 --> 10:26.640]  that you can set. Is it Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday? Is it the proper day? Do you
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.920]  have a.m. and p.m. set properly? Make sure you check out all of your controllers
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.560]  before you put plants in there and you accidentally flower them way too early.
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.960]  Also, check out all of your CO2 controls. Another thing I like to do at this point
[10:40.960 --> 10:46.160]  in time is calibrate all of my pens and meters. I like to calibrate my pH pen. I
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.560]  like to make sure that my EC meter is working properly. These are all things
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.880]  that you should check on between harvests. I like to calibrate my meters
[10:52.880 --> 10:56.880]  about once every two weeks to tell you the truth, probably every 10 days. I just
[10:56.880 --> 11:01.960]  like to check on them and make sure that those things are accurate. Another thing,
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.520]  you should have a fire extinguisher near your grow. Check on that. Look at the
[11:07.520 --> 11:11.560]  little gauge on there. Make sure it's in the green. If your fire extinguisher gauge
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.440]  is not in the green, either buy a new one or take it to the fire department and
[11:16.760 --> 11:21.520]  it refilled correctly. I really hope you don't have to use that fire extinguisher,
[11:21.520 --> 11:26.440]  but if you need it, I really want it to work for you. Also, check the batteries in
[11:26.440 --> 11:32.080]  your smoke alarm. Yes, I said smoke alarm. Your grow should have a smoke alarm. You
[11:32.080 --> 11:35.200]  don't want to burn down the house because something went wrong in the grow
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.440]  room and you did not have a smoke detector and a fire extinguisher. So be a
[11:39.440 --> 11:44.400]  responsible grower. Make sure that the safety precautions are in place. Now,
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.320]  since we're checking on the fire extinguisher and the smoke alarm, it is a
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.520]  good time to check on your respirator. Are you using a respirator to apply
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.560]  pesticides? I really hope you're using something to keep yourself safe. If
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.320]  you're using a respirator, now is the time to check those cartridges. How long
[11:59.320 --> 12:03.440]  have they been on there? Is it time to replace them? Is that respirator clean?
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.080]  Maybe it's time to watch a Google video and learn how to properly clean and take
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.080]  care of your respirator. That thing is going to save your life over time. Take
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.400]  care of that. Also, it's a good time to replace your gloves. Do you need more
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.120]  nitrile gloves? Do you need more Tyvek suits? Now is a really good time to make
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.080]  a list and go to the grow store and stock up on those types of items. All
[12:26.080 --> 12:29.000]  right, so we've got the grow room nice and clean. We have checked all of our
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.480]  safety precautions. We've refilled all of the necessary supplies. Now is a good
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.560]  time to do a quick inventory of your pesticides and nutrients and any
[12:37.560 --> 12:40.440]  accessories you think you may need. If you're going to need pesticides or
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.200]  nutrients, start ordering that stuff now so that when you move your plants back
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.680]  into the room, you have got all of the nutrients and all the supplies you need
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.720]  so that you don't miss a day of the grow cycle. So we've got everything cleaned
[12:51.720 --> 12:54.880]  up. We've checked out all of our safety equipment. We've restocked all of our
[12:54.880 --> 12:58.980]  personal protective equipment. We've reordered all of our nutrients. Now, if we
[12:58.980 --> 13:02.880]  didn't have any problems with pests or powdery mildew, it is time to start
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.080]  running that room and get it prepared for the next cycle. Now if you did have
[13:08.080 --> 13:12.440]  pests or problems, there are a couple of more steps that we need to take. We need
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.080]  to clean this room thoroughly. We need to spray it with some products. We might
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.640]  want to go a little harder with the bleach water. We might want to go a
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.320]  little harder with some Fizan. You might want to get a product called Pro-Cure. If
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.200]  you had powdery mildew, you're gonna want to spray something to get rid of the
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.440]  spores in that room. If you had bugs, I would recommend spraying some sort of
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.360]  pesticide through the entire room. Just mix up your pesticide sprayer, your pump
[13:39.360 --> 13:43.640]  sprayer. If you don't have one, go get one from Lowe's. Get a good one. Get a deck
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.400]  sprayer that can handle bleach because you're gonna be putting some chemicals
[13:46.400 --> 13:49.720]  in here. They're not that expensive. You just need one that holds about a gallon,
[13:49.720 --> 13:55.280]  maybe two gallons of water. Fill it up with water. Put your cleaning product in
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.040]  there, whether it's Fizan, whether it's Pro-Cure, whether it's a bunch of bleach.
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.080]  Maybe you want to use granulated sulfur if you had a PM issue. Mix that up. Spray
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.160]  the shit out of the entire room. This is your best opportunity to spray
[14:08.160 --> 14:11.740]  everything and eliminate your problem. There are no plants in there, so you can
[14:11.740 --> 14:14.960]  use products that you wouldn't spray when you've got plants in there. So get
[14:14.960 --> 14:18.540]  in there and clean the shit out of the room. I would start with the normal
[14:18.540 --> 14:22.760]  cleaning I recommended. Take everything down and clean it, then put it back up,
[14:22.760 --> 14:26.740]  then set up the room, and before you put the plants in there, go in there with
[14:26.740 --> 14:32.000]  this extra hard commando cleaning spray and go really hard, you guys. You got to
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.520]  get all of the bugs out of there, or you're just gonna bring plants in there
[14:35.520 --> 14:38.360]  and they're gonna get bugs, or they're gonna get PM, and you're gonna have
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.560]  another struggling harvest, and nobody likes to struggle through a harvest. So
[14:43.560 --> 14:46.400]  now we've taken everything apart. We've cleaned the shit out of the room. We've
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.760]  replaced the bulbs. We've replaced all of our filters. We have calibrated all of
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.400]  our equipment. We've got new protective equipment. We have tested our safety
[14:54.400 --> 14:57.640]  equipment. We've put the room back together. We've gone in there and done
[14:57.640 --> 15:02.520]  another final spray. Maybe we hit it with Fizan. Maybe we sprayed Pro-Cure on
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.320]  everything to try to get rid of our problems. Maybe we just sprayed bleach
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.600]  water, real hot bleach water in there. Maybe we went in there with some H2O2.
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.920]  That would work really well also, but if you use any type of product like that,
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.040]  you guys, make sure you wear personal protective equipment, some goggles, and a
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.120]  respirator. You don't want to spray bleach. You don't want to spray H2O2. You
[15:22.120 --> 15:25.840]  don't want to spray Fizan without some sort of protective equipment. That shit
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.680]  will be terrible for your eyes, terrible for your skin. Please take care of
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.400]  yourself, and if you're using a sprayer to spray anything, please use some sort
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.720]  of respiratory protection. Please. Now once the room is put back together, here
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.880]  is something I suggest. I would turn on the lights. I would turn on your blowers.
[15:43.880 --> 15:47.560]  I would turn on the fans. I would turn on the air conditioner, and I would let
[15:47.560 --> 15:50.600]  everything run for a few minutes, and I would stand in the room and pay
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.200]  attention. Is there anything wrong? Is there anything you could dial in? Is
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.720]  there anything you could adjust? Do it while you're in there. Then go outside
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.120]  and walk around your grow space. If your grow is at your house, just go walk
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.480]  around the house. Just go pick up trash around the house or whatever, and see if
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.600]  you can identify any light leaks. Do you see light coming out of your grow room?
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.960]  If you see light coming out, there is light going in. We do not want and
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.380]  cannot have light leaks in our grow room, so walk around the house. Walk around the
[16:21.380 --> 16:26.660]  perimeter. Identify any possible light leaks. Also, listen. Do you hear the
[16:26.660 --> 16:31.060]  blowers? Do you hear the fans? Do you hear your air conditioner? Is anything
[16:31.060 --> 16:35.860]  outside making it obvious that you're running a grow in that house? This is a
[16:35.860 --> 16:39.380]  good time to discover that we've got light leaks or that we've got noisy
[16:39.380 --> 16:42.940]  equipment so that we don't get ourselves in trouble. You do not want to attract
[16:42.940 --> 16:47.700]  law enforcement. It may be legal where you grow. It is legal where I grow. I am
[16:47.700 --> 16:51.540]  still stealth because you know who's worse than law enforcement? Fucking
[16:51.540 --> 16:55.980]  thieves. You don't want people to know you've got a grow in your house because
[16:55.980 --> 17:03.140]  somebody may come and take your crop from you. That is a real thing. Keep that
[17:03.140 --> 17:09.420]  in mind. You have to be careful even in a legal state. Keep your grow stealth. So
[17:09.420 --> 17:16.260]  walk around outside. Look. Listen. Smell. Pay attention. See if anything is going
[17:16.260 --> 17:21.420]  wrong outside. Once you're sure that everything is fine outside, that's when
[17:21.420 --> 17:25.260]  you can go back in the grow room, turn off the lights in the grow room, and
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.940]  stand in there for about 10 minutes. Let your eyes adjust. Now is the time to find
[17:29.940 --> 17:34.700]  out if any light is leaking into the grow. Now is the time to find out if the
[17:34.700 --> 17:39.820]  sunshine from outside is coming through your ducts for your vented hoods right
[17:39.820 --> 17:43.340]  into your light reflectors into your grow room and shining light on your
[17:43.340 --> 17:47.380]  plants during a dark period. Now is the time to find that out. Now the catch to
[17:47.380 --> 17:50.820]  these last two things, you're only gonna be able to tell if you have a light leak
[17:50.820 --> 17:55.020]  outside if you go walk around the house and it's dark outside. The only way you
[17:55.020 --> 17:59.420]  can tell if you have a light leak inside is if it's light outside and you go in
[17:59.420 --> 18:03.460]  the grow room and you turn off the lights on the inside of the grow room. So
[18:03.460 --> 18:06.620]  you're gonna have to find the time of day to do that. You're gonna have to do
[18:06.620 --> 18:11.060]  some investigating and some inspecting, but these are very important details to
[18:11.060 --> 18:14.960]  not overlook. Make sure your grow room is lightproof. Make sure there's not a
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.100]  lot of noise coming out of there, and also find out if you've got too much
[18:20.100 --> 18:24.340]  aroma and correct it if you do. You don't want to attract attention that you don't
[18:24.340 --> 18:28.460]  need. Once you've been growing for a while, or if you're somebody who is
[18:28.460 --> 18:32.340]  looking for grows, so say myself, I've been growing for a long time. When I used
[18:32.340 --> 18:36.460]  to go walk my dog in my neighborhood, I would always discover a new grow. I would
[18:36.460 --> 18:39.340]  go a different route. I'd go two blocks that way, three blocks that way, a block
[18:39.460 --> 18:41.940]  that way, and then I'd come back and then the next day I'd just do a different
[18:41.940 --> 18:46.500]  pattern. I would always find a new grow about once a week because I know what
[18:46.500 --> 18:50.220]  I'm looking for, listening for, and smelling for. I know the details. I know
[18:50.220 --> 18:55.300]  the clues. If I hear your weird blower at 3 in the morning going from your
[18:55.300 --> 18:58.860]  basement window, chances are you got a grow in there. If you've got an air
[18:58.860 --> 19:02.820]  conditioner in your basement window in the middle of winter, chances are there's
[19:02.820 --> 19:07.180]  a grow in there. If you've got one window by the basement that has no snow and the
[19:07.180 --> 19:11.100]  rest of the backyard is snowy, there's a grow in there. If there's one spot on
[19:11.100 --> 19:15.180]  your roof above one bedroom that there's no snow on it, there's a grow in there.
[19:15.180 --> 19:20.100]  There are really easy signs that give it away, so pay attention you guys, because
[19:20.100 --> 19:24.820]  if I can see it, law enforcement can see it, and so can the thieves. So be careful
[19:24.820 --> 19:29.540]  with your grow. Try to stay stealth even in legal states. There's no reason to
[19:29.540 --> 19:34.380]  brag. There's no reason to set bait. Alright, Podcast World, I feel like that
[19:34.540 --> 19:39.260]  is a pretty good clean and reset episode. Hopefully I mentioned some details that
[19:39.260 --> 19:42.580]  you would have overlooked. Hopefully I rescued you through a couple of pitfalls.
[19:42.580 --> 19:47.540]  Now you don't have to make those mistakes. Hopefully everything was well
[19:47.540 --> 19:49.980]  in your grow and you don't have any problems. Hopefully you don't have
[19:49.980 --> 19:54.540]  anything funky to deal with. Also, now that the grow is nice and clean, let's
[19:54.540 --> 19:58.580]  fucking keep it clean. Let's get in there with a mop and a broom every day if we
[19:58.580 --> 20:01.940]  need to, and mop and sweep that bitch. Let's get in there with a shop vac and
[20:01.940 --> 20:05.140]  suck out, you know that shit in the corner you've been looking at? Get the
[20:05.140 --> 20:08.860]  fucking shop vac and vac that out. It's not gonna shop vac itself, and that's a
[20:08.860 --> 20:12.780]  great place for a spider mite to hang out. That's a great place for some aphids
[20:12.780 --> 20:16.180]  to hang out and breed. That's a great place for some powdery mildew to start.
[20:16.180 --> 20:20.540]  That is just a vector for problems. So now that you've got it nice and clean,
[20:20.540 --> 20:25.380]  don't be lazy. Get in there and clean it as often as you can. They say that
[20:25.380 --> 20:30.220]  cleanliness is godliness, and I think that most applies in kitchens and grow
[20:30.340 --> 20:33.740]  rooms, you guys. So clean up that grow room, give yourself a nice clean
[20:33.740 --> 20:37.300]  environment, give your plants a nice healthy start. I think your plants will
[20:37.300 --> 20:41.300]  be more comfortable, and I think you will also notice working in a cleaner, more
[20:41.300 --> 20:45.260]  organized environment will make you happier. It'll make you faster and more
[20:45.260 --> 20:49.420]  productive. And shit, now that you're done cleaning up the grow room, why don't you
[20:49.420 --> 20:53.740]  clean up all your supplies? Go organize your nutrients, go organize the pesticides,
[20:53.740 --> 20:57.380]  the measuring devices, your cleaning supplies. Go write down a list of
[20:57.380 --> 21:00.580]  anything that you can need, anything that you're low on. Go get yourself
[21:00.580 --> 21:06.780]  organized. Also, get a notebook and start making detailed notes. Start documenting
[21:06.780 --> 21:10.460]  when you changed your bulb. Start documenting when you changed your carbon
[21:10.460 --> 21:14.860]  filter. Start documenting the last time you changed your air conditioner filters
[21:14.860 --> 21:18.460]  and calibrated your meters. Start writing that stuff down so that when something
[21:18.460 --> 21:21.940]  comes up, you can look in there and go, oh, that's why my pH meter isn't working. I
[21:21.940 --> 21:25.660]  haven't calibrated the fucking thing in two months. You may find some things you
[21:25.660 --> 21:30.260]  were slipping on if you start taking more notes. Alright, podcast world, I feel
[21:30.260 --> 21:34.180]  like that pretty much wraps up my clean and reset the grow room episode. I want
[21:34.180 --> 21:36.500]  to thank you guys for listening. Thanks for hanging out with me for another
