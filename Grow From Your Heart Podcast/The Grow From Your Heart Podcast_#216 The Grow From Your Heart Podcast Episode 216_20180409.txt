[00:12.360 --> 00:15.360]  Let me make a couple of disclaimers before we get to the show.
[00:15.360 --> 00:22.360]  If I said any advertising, if I had any contests going on, anything like that, that's all expired. Doesn't count anymore. Don't get too excited.
[00:22.360 --> 00:25.360]  Also, all of the social media needs to be updated.
[00:25.360 --> 00:29.360]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast. On Facebook, it's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.360]  If you'd like to send me an email, it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.360]  Of course, I would love to hear from you.
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.360]  Let me keep this file nice and short.
[00:37.360 --> 00:41.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's 49, 50, and 51 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.400 --> 01:02.400]  What's up, cannabis community? It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.400 --> 01:04.400]  Welcome to episode number 49.
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.400]  I apologize in advance. I can already tell that my voice sounds all terrible because I've got a cold.
[01:09.400 --> 01:12.400]  But as a professional podcaster, this show must go on.
[01:13.400 --> 01:16.400]  I'm going to skip that long intro that I do, and we're just going to introduce everybody that's here.
[01:16.400 --> 01:18.400]  To my left, we got Adam. What's up, brother?
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.400]  Yo, what's up, man?
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.400]  To the left of him is White Mike.
[01:20.400 --> 01:21.400]  How you guys doing?
[01:21.400 --> 01:24.400]  Over here is everybody's favorite. It's Jesse. How you doing, bro?
[01:24.400 --> 01:25.400]  Pretty good. How's it going?
[01:25.400 --> 01:27.400]  I'm good, man. Thanks for coming, you guys.
[01:27.400 --> 01:29.400]  Yeah. Thanks for having us back.
[01:29.400 --> 01:30.400]  Oh, for sure, man. Thanks.
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.400]  These guys actually messaged me today, and they were like, podcast around 730.
[01:35.400 --> 01:36.400]  It's been a long Christmas season.
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.400]  About 830-ish, they all showed up.
[01:39.400 --> 01:41.400]  And now we're here to do a podcast.
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.400]  So, man, yeah, I want to apologize. I can tell that I'm going to sound stuffy.
[01:45.400 --> 01:47.400]  There may be a pause or two in this episode for me to take care of this.
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.400]  I got a broken pipe in my brain somewhere, and my nose faucet is just dripping, dude.
[01:52.400 --> 01:54.400]  Oh, my God. I don't know what I did.
[01:54.400 --> 01:57.400]  It's not real professional sounding. I apologize in advance.
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.400]  Made some plumbers crack.
[01:59.400 --> 02:02.400]  Yeah. No, wait. No plumbers crack in my face.
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.400]  Some plumbers putty or tape or some shit, but no plumbers crack in my face.
[02:06.400 --> 02:07.400]  Yeah, that's probably right.
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.400]  How about plumbers on crack?
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.400]  Okay. As long as I can get here on time and get my nose fixed, I'm cool with it.
[02:13.400 --> 02:18.400]  I think enough. I've been drinking lots of good hydrating liquids and shit.
[02:18.400 --> 02:20.400]  I should be cool. Shout-out to Coconut Water. That's been helping me out.
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.400]  Okay.
[02:21.400 --> 02:25.400]  I do owe a big shout-out to Koot and Kat from the Mystic Roots Band for letting me play their music on the show.
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.400]  That's awesome. Thanks, guys.
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.400]  So, can we talk about the project you boys have been working on?
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.400]  Are we allowed to talk about that?
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.400]  Yeah. Fuck yeah.
[02:32.400 --> 02:33.400]  These guys showed up here.
[02:33.400 --> 02:34.400]  They look beat, dude.
[02:34.400 --> 02:38.400]  All of them look like they have just been through the freaking ringer.
[02:38.400 --> 02:40.400]  Yeah. I run them pretty hard.
[02:40.400 --> 02:43.400]  It's been a long couple of weeks, but a good couple of weeks.
[02:43.400 --> 02:45.400]  Yeah. So, Jesse is apparently the boss.
[02:45.400 --> 02:47.400]  Yeah.
[02:47.400 --> 02:48.400]  That's scary.
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.400]  Yeah. That's a long story.
[02:52.400 --> 02:55.400]  I'm a full-blown consultant.
[02:55.400 --> 02:59.400]  Let me tell you what. I'll do anything you need to get your place going.
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.400]  Including accidentally start a construction company.
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.400]  Yeah. He'll build your grow out, and then he'll supply it with grow supplies.
[03:07.400 --> 03:11.400]  And then him and I will teach you how to grow, and then we've got a grow team on hand if you need employees.
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.400]  We'll sell you genetics. We can hook you up with start-to-finish folks.
[03:15.400 --> 03:17.400]  With oil producers.
[03:17.400 --> 03:18.400]  You got the right people.
[03:18.400 --> 03:20.400]  Yeah. We do have quite a team here.
[03:20.400 --> 03:23.400]  So, you guys have been saying that Adam has fucking found his niche.
[03:23.400 --> 03:24.400]  Yeah. We all thought.
[03:24.400 --> 03:25.400]  We found his wheelhouse, finally.
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.400]  We've been hunting for a while now, and we for sure found it.
[03:29.400 --> 03:30.400]  How long have you been here now, bro?
[03:30.400 --> 03:32.400]  It'll be a year in February.
[03:32.400 --> 03:34.400]  It'll be a year in February. Dude, you fell in pretty quickly.
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.400]  Yeah. I'm happy here, man. I was thinking about that today.
[03:38.400 --> 03:42.400]  Colorado has changed me for the better.
[03:42.400 --> 03:44.400]  I used to be a hermit and stuff like that.
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.400]  And just getting out. We all felt it today.
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.400]  When he asked me, let's go, and I'm like, yeah, I'm in.
[03:52.400 --> 03:57.400]  The other podcasts were great, but you felt it in you.
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.400]  You were like, I miss my friends.
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.400]  Yeah, dude. Sorry.
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.400]  It's fun doing those holiday shows without you guys were cool.
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.400]  I got to ramble.
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.400]  And you know what? I felt an evolution in myself.
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.400]  Because if my voice changed, I honestly just stuck a lot of toilet paper in my nose
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.400]  to keep my nose from freaking running because it's dripping and it's disgusting.
[04:14.400 --> 04:16.400]  So, if I sound weird, that's why.
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.400]  It's not puberty issues.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.400]  It's not me cracking.
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.400]  But no, it was fun.
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.400]  I felt the evolution because those earlier shows, when it was me on the mic by myself,
[04:25.400 --> 04:29.400]  it felt like I was reading this podcast is brought to you by nature's green remedies.com.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.400]  That's what it felt like.
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.400]  They did get a little stuff there.
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.400]  The last couple episodes, I flipped the papers over that I had on the desk and just started talking.
[04:35.400 --> 04:37.400]  I was like, fuck all the notes.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.400]  This is what I want to say.
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.400]  And it's fun.
[04:39.400 --> 04:41.400]  It was way more comfortable.
[04:41.400 --> 04:43.400]  It was good, man.
[04:43.400 --> 04:45.400]  I didn't too much at the beginning know how to put.
[04:45.400 --> 04:47.400]  Nobody cared about me.
[04:47.400 --> 04:50.400]  I didn't want to come out and be like, this is me and my podcast.
[04:50.400 --> 04:52.400]  I feel like I made friends with all my listeners.
[04:52.400 --> 04:54.400]  So, they do kind of care.
[04:54.400 --> 04:55.400]  I'm not cracking.
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.400]  Yeah.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.400]  So, we're saying that Adam's found his wheelhouse.
[04:57.400 --> 04:58.400]  This kid's a framer.
[04:58.400 --> 05:00.400]  He swings a hammer and frames like a champ.
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.400]  Kind of.
[05:01.400 --> 05:02.400]  Who would have known?
[05:02.400 --> 05:03.400]  Yeah.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.400]  I've done it for a while, man.
[05:04.400 --> 05:07.400]  I mean, I've had opportunities offered to me like, let's go start a business.
[05:07.400 --> 05:09.400]  And it's like, dude, you don't.
[05:09.400 --> 05:11.400]  I have problems, you know?
[05:11.400 --> 05:14.400]  And at this table, a lot of these people kind of understand those problems.
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.400]  So, you know, it's that stoner kind of mentality where, you know.
[05:18.400 --> 05:20.400]  Do you not play well with others on some of these?
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.400]  I may not.
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.400]  But who doesn't?
[05:23.400 --> 05:24.400]  It's a job site.
[05:24.400 --> 05:25.400]  It's not an office.
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.400]  You know, like you go off and cool off for 20 minutes.
[05:28.400 --> 05:30.400]  There's always one guy at work every day.
[05:30.400 --> 05:35.400]  That one person has a problem and that one guy's got a stick up his ass and it seems to rotate.
[05:35.400 --> 05:37.400]  That's just how job sites are.
[05:37.400 --> 05:42.400]  We're doing construction in unheated, sometimes poorly or unlit warehouses.
[05:42.400 --> 05:45.400]  So, I mean, tempers can flare quickly.
[05:45.400 --> 05:48.400]  But we've got the team pretty chilled out.
[05:48.400 --> 05:51.400]  And like, okay, go take a 20.
[05:51.400 --> 05:52.400]  Chill yourself out break.
[05:52.400 --> 05:54.400]  Chill yourself out break is pretty standard.
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.400]  Nice.
[05:55.400 --> 05:57.400]  We've learned to swing it correctly.
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.400]  No tools go flying at each other.
[05:59.400 --> 06:00.400]  We have fun.
[06:00.400 --> 06:01.400]  Regularly anymore.
[06:01.400 --> 06:02.400]  Yeah.
[06:02.400 --> 06:05.400]  So, that's part of the reason why I don't do construction.
[06:05.400 --> 06:07.400]  I'd rather just be a lone wolf growing.
[06:07.400 --> 06:10.400]  So, I kind of, sometimes I'm like, man, these guys are having fun all day.
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.400]  I want to go to work somewhere with them.
[06:11.400 --> 06:13.400]  And then I'm like, nah.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.400]  Or I could just maybe.
[06:14.400 --> 06:15.400]  Maybe one day.
[06:15.400 --> 06:21.400]  But as, you know, as for me, I got to get some money set up before I can lone wolf grow.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.400]  So, it's Tuesday night as we record.
[06:22.400 --> 06:26.400]  I actually have another meeting tomorrow in the morning at the spot.
[06:26.400 --> 06:29.400]  So, things are starting to definitely come together.
[06:29.400 --> 06:32.400]  I was in there checking out the grow a few days ago.
[06:32.400 --> 06:33.400]  It's kind of a mess.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.400]  They're getting a lot of shit done.
[06:34.400 --> 06:38.400]  The floors, the walls, and the ceiling are all the same material.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.400]  And it looks like one sheet of everything.
[06:40.400 --> 06:42.400]  I can't find the seams in this material.
[06:42.400 --> 06:44.400]  And these rooms are bigger than my house.
[06:44.400 --> 06:47.400]  I'm like, how the fuck did they do this?
[06:47.400 --> 06:48.400]  Dude, it's amazing.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.400]  So, when they get those finished, I'll be growing in there.
[06:50.400 --> 06:51.400]  But I'm going tomorrow.
[06:51.400 --> 06:53.400]  They're actually talking about sending me to.
[06:53.400 --> 06:55.400]  There's a company that built our grow.
[06:55.400 --> 06:57.400]  They're talking about sending me to their flagship grow.
[06:57.400 --> 07:01.400]  So, that I can go check it out and see what happens and learn from their grow a little bit.
[07:01.400 --> 07:02.400]  That'll be neat.
[07:02.400 --> 07:03.400]  Nice.
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.400]  Is that a cannabis grow?
[07:04.400 --> 07:05.400]  Yeah, it's a cannabis grow.
[07:05.400 --> 07:06.400]  I think it's by.
[07:06.400 --> 07:07.400]  I don't want to say the wrong name.
[07:07.400 --> 07:08.400]  I'm pretty sure.
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.400]  No, I was told that I was wrong about who made that.
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.400]  There was a company that made it.
[07:12.400 --> 07:13.400]  And then another guy kind of.
[07:13.400 --> 07:14.400]  He was part of that company.
[07:14.400 --> 07:18.400]  He separated from them and improved on it and sold them the improved ideas.
[07:18.400 --> 07:19.400]  Yeah.
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.400]  I've seen it.
[07:20.400 --> 07:21.400]  Go ahead.
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.400]  You've seen it?
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.400]  No, seeing it get built.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.400]  Oh, yeah.
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.400]  Is also a different perspective.
[07:25.400 --> 07:28.400]  We're not lights or anything like that.
[07:28.400 --> 07:31.400]  But just preparation for that.
[07:31.400 --> 07:32.400]  Yeah.
[07:32.400 --> 07:36.400]  Are they going to hire a grow specific company to come in there and do that?
[07:36.400 --> 07:37.400]  Or are you guys doing it all the way to the end?
[07:37.400 --> 07:38.400]  We're going to do it.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.400]  Nice.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.400]  With advice from.
[07:41.400 --> 07:44.400]  I have reps phone numbers in my.
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.400]  There you go.
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.400]  HVAC guys.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.400]  Electricians.
[07:47.400 --> 07:48.400]  Yeah.
[07:48.400 --> 07:53.400]  But we're having an HVAC company come in and put in specific units.
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.400]  Guys, if you're building a.
[07:55.400 --> 07:56.400]  Specifically set up.
[07:56.400 --> 07:58.400]  So if you're building a personal grow, get a real electrician.
[07:58.400 --> 08:00.400]  Just have him inspect everything.
[08:00.400 --> 08:04.400]  There's so many electricians on Craig's list and shit that are legit.
[08:04.400 --> 08:06.400]  They're not going to snitch on you for growing herb.
[08:06.400 --> 08:08.400]  If you're in Colorado, get an electrician.
[08:08.400 --> 08:11.400]  Don't be that asshole that burned down your house by trying to grow too many
[08:11.400 --> 08:12.400]  lights in one room.
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.400]  There was a story in the paper today.
[08:14.400 --> 08:17.400]  Some idiot brewing hooch blew his house up.
[08:17.400 --> 08:21.400]  And I saw the photo and I explosion in Pueblo County.
[08:21.400 --> 08:23.400]  I went, oh, shit, please.
[08:23.400 --> 08:24.400]  Fuck.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.400]  No, fuck.
[08:25.400 --> 08:26.400]  No, fuck.
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.400]  No.
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.400]  And I got down to alcohol.
[08:28.400 --> 08:29.400]  Yes.
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.400]  I don't want to give them the idea, but I strongly suspect they were making
[08:32.400 --> 08:33.400]  BHO in there.
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.400]  I don't, I don't see how alcohol would have.
[08:35.400 --> 08:36.400]  I mean, I don't know.
[08:36.400 --> 08:38.400]  No, that was a big thing during prohibition.
[08:38.400 --> 08:40.400]  This is why you can't make.
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.400]  Shines.
[08:41.400 --> 08:42.400]  Yeah.

[08:43.400 --> 08:44.400]  I don't know about here.
[08:44.400 --> 08:46.400]  I know a couple of guys from where I'm from.
[08:46.400 --> 08:47.400]  They do it up in the woods.
[08:47.400 --> 08:49.400]  Like, yeah, that's what I mean.
[08:49.400 --> 08:51.400]  They're not doing it in an apartment.
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.400]  Yeah.

[10:01.400 --> 10:04.400]  Just by saying that you're going to pay the same exact price that I pay.
[10:04.400 --> 10:05.400]  That's pretty cool.
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.400]  I wrote all these ads.

[10:10.400 --> 10:11.400]  Yes,
[10:11.400 --> 10:13.400]  I'm having even more people hit us up on that.
[10:13.400 --> 10:14.400]  That's awesome.
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.400]  That's great.
[10:15.400 --> 10:16.400]  It's good to hear people are local.
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.400]  People are listening to the show.
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.400]  Yeah.
[10:18.400 --> 10:20.400]  People from other States are calling the store in place and orders too.
[10:20.400 --> 10:21.400]  That's pretty sweet.
[10:21.400 --> 10:23.400]  We got a girl Kashi and two days ago.
[10:23.400 --> 10:24.400]  Oh,
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.400]  grow Kashi.
[10:25.400 --> 10:27.400]  I've seen more grow Kashi in the past few days.
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.400]  And I've,
[10:28.400 --> 10:30.400]  I've heard it on the show.
[10:30.400 --> 10:31.400]  I still didn't know what it was.
[10:31.400 --> 10:32.400]  And yeah,
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.400]  maybe I'll go pick up a bag.
[10:34.400 --> 10:36.400]  I need to go to hydro for a couple of things in the near future.
[10:36.400 --> 10:37.400]  Maybe I'll pick up a bag.
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.400]  We'll talk about it on the show a little bit.
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.400]  Speaking of grow Kashi,
[10:40.400 --> 10:41.400]  I'm going to kind of branch off here.
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.400]  I saw a box of prizes being donated to the show from high grow Pueblo.
[10:46.400 --> 10:47.400]  Yeah.
[10:47.400 --> 10:49.400]  There might be some grow Kashi.
[10:49.400 --> 10:52.400]  There might be some OGT and other no GT is not going to be.
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.400]  I'm going to jack that out of there.
[10:53.400 --> 10:54.400]  No,
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.400]  there's a,
[10:55.400 --> 10:56.400]  there's,
[10:56.400 --> 10:57.400]  there's actually a bag of grow Kashi.
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.400]  There's some OGT and there are some other nutrients in there.
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.400]  There are some really cool things in there.
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.400]  Grab bag or swag bags.
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.400]  Yeah.
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.400]  Our good friend task rocks sent us a highly educated t-shirt and size large.
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.400]  Uh,
[11:10.400 --> 11:13.400]  there are a couple few IRI genetics t-shirts.
[11:13.400 --> 11:14.400]  There are a couple of hat pins in there.
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.400]  There's an IRI sticker pack.
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.400]  Nice.
[11:17.400 --> 11:18.400]  Yeah.
[11:18.400 --> 11:19.400]  Um,
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.400]  Spence from the garden of Whedon may possibly have some prizes for us.
[11:21.400 --> 11:23.400]  I know there's a couple of garden of Whedon stickers.
[11:23.400 --> 11:24.400]  Cause I've got those.
[11:24.400 --> 11:25.400]  I'm hoping to get a shirt from him,
[11:25.400 --> 11:26.400]  but the man is busy.
[11:26.400 --> 11:27.400]  Um,
[11:27.400 --> 11:28.400]  uh,
[11:28.400 --> 11:29.400]  yeah.
[11:29.400 --> 11:30.400]  So guys check out episode 50.
[11:30.400 --> 11:33.400]  I'm hoping to have all three of these guys back plus Maddie and Spence,
[11:33.400 --> 11:35.400]  which means it's going to be crowded as I'm looking at the table,
[11:35.400 --> 11:37.400]  but we'll figure it out.
[11:38.400 --> 11:39.400]  A little bit more.
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.400]  Yeah.
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.400]  We've got more chairs over there.
[11:41.400 --> 11:42.400]  Yeah.
[11:42.400 --> 11:45.400]  I'll stand up the whole time and act like a game show host or something.
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.400]  Here we go.
[11:46.400 --> 11:47.400]  Um,
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.400]  yeah,
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.400]  there's not a whole lot to talk about in this episode guys.
[11:49.400 --> 11:50.400]  I felt like crap today.
[11:50.400 --> 11:52.400]  I didn't prepare and I just wanted to have these guys over.
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.400]  We're going to kind of bullshit and read a news article.
[11:54.400 --> 11:55.400]  Uh,
[11:55.400 --> 11:56.400]  before I do that,
[11:56.400 --> 11:58.400]  I got to say shout out to tree thugger.com.
[11:58.400 --> 12:01.400]  This episode is brought to you in part by tree thugger.com live music,

[12:15.400 --> 12:17.400]  the info that you need about that.
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.400]  I think that's all the show opening important part.
[12:20.400 --> 12:22.400]  I'm supposed to make sure I cover.
[12:22.400 --> 12:23.400]  All right.
[12:23.400 --> 12:24.400]  All right.
[12:24.400 --> 12:25.400]  You guys want to read a weird news article?
[12:25.400 --> 12:26.400]  Absolutely.
[12:26.400 --> 12:29.400]  There's four men sitting at this table and I'm about to say the word vagina
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.400]  a whole bunch of times.
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.400]  This article is from the cannabis.
[12:34.400 --> 12:35.400]  Uh, you know,
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.400]  what's cool about the cannabis when I open up the cannabis website,
[12:37.400 --> 12:38.400]  right on the top,
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.400]  there is an,
[12:39.400 --> 12:40.400]  uh,
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.400]  an advertisement for the spot.
[12:41.400 --> 12:43.400]  Southern Colorado's largest dispensary,
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.400]  no long waits,
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.400]  friendly bud tenders and new strains weekly visit us today at the spot.
[12:47.400 --> 12:49.400]  The spot did not pay for that ad,
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.400]  but,
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.400]  uh,
[12:51.400 --> 12:52.400]  I endorsed the spot.
[12:52.400 --> 12:53.400]  Dude,
[12:53.400 --> 12:54.400]  there's a cute little bud tender with dreadlocks over there.
[12:54.400 --> 12:55.400]  Go visit her.
[12:55.400 --> 12:56.400]  Say what's up.
[12:56.400 --> 12:57.400]  She'll sell you some dank herbs.
[12:57.400 --> 12:58.400]  Yeah.
[12:58.400 --> 12:59.400]  Go visit the spot.
[12:59.400 --> 13:00.400]  So,
[13:00.400 --> 13:01.400]  uh,
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.400]  the cannabis,
[13:02.400 --> 13:04.400]  the headline is that we'd infused sex lube for ladies.
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.400]  It'll be on Colorado shelves this month.
[13:06.400 --> 13:08.400]  That's what I said.
[13:08.400 --> 13:09.400]  Everybody in the room just looked at me like,
[13:09.400 --> 13:10.400]  what the fuck dude?
[13:10.400 --> 13:12.400]  I've heard about this.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.400]  I saw that this morning.
[13:13.400 --> 13:16.400]  I thought that was just some satire.
[13:16.400 --> 13:17.400]  You thought it was the onion.
[13:17.400 --> 13:20.400]  This is a product that's gotten a lot of press over the last year.
[13:20.400 --> 13:21.400]  Yeah.
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.400]  It's been in Kelly for a while.
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.400]  I think it has,
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.400]  I think that the same product.
[13:24.400 --> 13:25.400]  So it says,
[13:25.400 --> 13:28.400]  remember when we first wrote about THC infused sex lube,
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.400]  uh,
[13:29.400 --> 13:30.400]  Floria and it's quite,
[13:30.400 --> 13:33.400]  quite singular user instructions in June,
[13:33.400 --> 13:34.400]  2014.
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.400]  I remember it says apply four to eight sprays directly onto the,
[13:38.400 --> 13:42.400]  the clitoris and outer labia and inside the vagina.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.400]  I don't know.
[13:44.400 --> 13:47.400]  I always like counting the number of sprays in the middle of sex.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.400]  Didn't they used to do the same thing with Lysol?
[13:50.400 --> 13:56.400]  They actually said quite singular user instructions.
[13:56.400 --> 13:57.400]  So it's not during sex.
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.400]  This is by yourself.
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.400]  This chick sitting on the couch or somewhere.
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.400]  You do four and wait and see if you feel anything and then do three or
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.400]  four more later.
[14:06.400 --> 14:09.400]  Do you have to wait two hours?
[14:09.400 --> 14:11.400]  There's a mucus membrane.
[14:11.400 --> 14:12.400]  That's all a mucus membrane.
[14:12.400 --> 14:13.400]  It's going to happen quickly.
[14:13.400 --> 14:15.400]  That's going to be in a minute.
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.400]  I'm all for the product.
[14:19.400 --> 14:20.400]  I just,
[14:20.400 --> 14:21.400]  the number of pumps then come.
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.400]  That's what I want to know.
[14:23.400 --> 14:25.400]  Why is it always like I get it so easy.
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.400]  So I'm going to continue with the article before it goes on a porn rant.
[14:29.400 --> 14:31.400]  That interview with Los Angeles based and Foria founder,
[14:31.400 --> 14:34.400]  Matthew Gerson helps introduce the unique product to the masses.
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.400]  And now Gerson who originally hails from Boulder is debuting his special
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.400]  non-psychoactive lube outside of California for the very first time.
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.400]  Floria will make its Colorado debut at the native roots location in Aspen
[14:45.400 --> 14:49.400]  during the winter X games on January 21st through 25th.
[14:49.400 --> 14:50.400]  That's confused.
[14:50.400 --> 14:51.400]  What are they,
[14:51.400 --> 14:52.400]  what are they,
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.400]  what are they targeting?
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.400]  You're debuting your THC infused sex lube at the X games.
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.400]  Like I know I'm totally just heard all those words in the correct.
[15:01.400 --> 15:04.400]  I don't know if I want to cross the line of words.
[15:04.400 --> 15:05.400]  I want to say on this show.
[15:05.400 --> 15:08.400]  You got all beat up at the X games.
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.400]  Here's some lube to make it freaking feel.
[15:09.400 --> 15:10.400]  Oh,
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.400]  okay.
[15:14.400 --> 15:17.400]  So the article says I came out to LA from Colorado and I've been trying to
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.400]  get back ever since Gerson told the cannabis,
[15:20.400 --> 15:23.400]  I'm super excited to be bringing it to Colorado and native roots is a good
[15:23.400 --> 15:24.400]  alignment for us.
[15:24.400 --> 15:26.400]  So it'll be available at native roots.
[15:26.400 --> 15:27.400]  Uh,
[15:27.400 --> 15:30.400]  need a reminder on what Floria is per Gerson from my June interview with him.
[15:30.400 --> 15:33.400]  It's a sensual enhancement oil designed for female pleasure,
[15:33.400 --> 15:38.400]  a therapeutic aphrodisiac women have described it as relaxing and they've
[15:38.400 --> 15:40.400]  said it's heightened their sensations.
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.400]  They've associated it with warming and tingling localized in the sexual
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.400]  region.
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.400]  Well,
[15:45.400 --> 15:46.400]  that's where you're spraying it.
[15:46.400 --> 15:47.400]  You're going to feel it on your arm.
[15:48.400 --> 15:49.400]  Uh,
[15:49.400 --> 15:50.400]  Florida will be on sale at native roots,
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.400]  a native roots is new Aspen location at three Oh eight South hunter street
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.400]  throughout the X games and all other native roots locations.
[15:56.400 --> 15:57.400]  After the big event,
[15:57.400 --> 16:00.400]  native roots is Floria's partner in Colorado.
[16:00.400 --> 16:03.400]  And how have the last six months been for Floria in California?
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.400]  He says,
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.400]  we never could have imagined the impact it's having on the patient community
[16:08.400 --> 16:11.400]  in California and how it's spanned the spectrum of users from younger women
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.400]  who are looking to deepen,
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.400]  looking to deepen the level of intimacy of their own bodies to older women
[16:17.400 --> 16:20.400]  who are experiencing a reawakening of their own sexuality.
[16:20.400 --> 16:24.400]  Gerson said there are a large number of women who could benefit from cannabis,
[16:24.400 --> 16:27.400]  but who aren't interested in the psychoactive component.
[16:27.400 --> 16:30.400]  The products expansion into Colorado is only the beginning.
[16:30.400 --> 16:31.400]  Gerson estimates,
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.400]  Floria will be available in Washington state pot stores in the next few
[16:35.400 --> 16:36.400]  months.
[16:36.400 --> 16:39.400]  Does anybody else want to get this for a chick they hate and be like,
[16:39.400 --> 16:41.400]  I got this great perfume.
[16:41.400 --> 16:42.400]  Just like,
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.400]  here you go.
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.400]  I think it'd be funny to get you a bottle.
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.400]  And when you take a big dab and start crying,
[16:47.400 --> 16:48.400]  I can do that to spray.
[16:48.400 --> 16:49.400]  Absolutely.
[16:49.400 --> 16:51.400]  I would spray the roast beef sandwich down,
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.400]  dude.
[16:52.400 --> 16:53.400]  Non-psychoactive.
[16:53.400 --> 16:54.400]  Yeah.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.400]  Yeah.
[16:55.400 --> 16:56.400]  Okay.
[16:56.400 --> 16:57.400]  It's,
[16:57.400 --> 16:58.400]  um,
[16:58.400 --> 17:00.400]  I don't know.
[17:00.400 --> 17:03.400]  I know a guy that claims he made a lube using coconut oil and cannabis.
[17:03.400 --> 17:05.400]  And he says when he uses it on chicks,
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.400]  that they definitely enjoy it a lot more than when he doesn't use it.
[17:09.400 --> 17:10.400]  Um,
[17:10.400 --> 17:11.400]  I just wanted to,
[17:11.400 --> 17:13.400]  I thought it'd be fun to read this with four dudes at the table.
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.400]  So I cannabis a lot more when I use it prior than when I don't use it.
[17:19.400 --> 17:20.400]  The article was awesome.
[17:20.400 --> 17:23.400]  It was just fucking I've heard of puns and shit.
[17:23.400 --> 17:24.400]  Yeah.
[17:24.400 --> 17:25.400]  Yeah.
[17:25.400 --> 17:28.400]  I've heard a lot of placebo warnings about this,
[17:28.400 --> 17:29.400]  you know,
[17:29.400 --> 17:32.400]  where as in it's paid $80 for it.
[17:32.400 --> 17:33.400]  Yeah.
[17:33.400 --> 17:34.400]  Yeah.
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.400]  Better tingle.
[17:35.400 --> 17:36.400]  If she's gonna,
[17:36.400 --> 17:38.400]  if she's spraying it on her clit and inner and outer labia,
[17:38.400 --> 17:39.400]  it's working,
[17:39.400 --> 17:42.400]  it's already moisten and shit up and that's waking it up a little.
[17:42.400 --> 17:44.400]  So even if it doesn't work,
[17:44.400 --> 17:46.400]  but have you ever eaten like tincture or,
[17:46.400 --> 17:47.400]  um,
[17:47.400 --> 17:49.400]  I guess it just tincture that does it,
[17:49.400 --> 17:50.400]  but you get warm inside.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.400]  Like you feel warm and fuzzy.
[17:52.400 --> 17:54.400]  I can just imagine spending some tincture on my junk though,
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.400]  letting it get all sticky and gross.
[17:56.400 --> 17:58.400]  That's what I felt that night from that,
[17:58.400 --> 17:59.400]  uh,
[17:59.400 --> 18:00.400]  mountain bar.
[18:00.400 --> 18:01.400]  You know,
[18:01.400 --> 18:02.400]  that's,
[18:02.400 --> 18:03.400]  that's the whole feeling that I really got.
[18:03.400 --> 18:04.400]  Did you,
[18:04.400 --> 18:05.400]  did you run the mountain bar on your junk?
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.400]  No,
[18:06.400 --> 18:07.400]  no,
[18:07.400 --> 18:08.400]  I'll try that next time.
[18:08.400 --> 18:09.400]  That'll be $12.
[18:09.400 --> 18:10.400]  Well spent.
[18:10.400 --> 18:11.400]  I'll tell you how much right now.
[18:12.400 --> 18:14.400]  350 milligrams of action.
[18:14.400 --> 18:15.400]  THC right to my tank.
[18:15.400 --> 18:16.400]  Yeah.
[18:16.400 --> 18:17.400]  I'm done.
[18:17.400 --> 18:20.400]  I refrained myself from using taint early.
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.400]  This show just got really,
[18:22.400 --> 18:23.400]  really weird.
[18:23.400 --> 18:24.400]  Don't worry.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.400]  I've done ruin that for you.
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.400]  So I know a product that definitely does work that apothecary.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  Uh,
[18:30.400 --> 18:31.400]  pain relief.
[18:31.400 --> 18:32.400]  Yeah.
[18:32.400 --> 18:33.400]  With the juniper Arnica cannabis stuff.
[18:33.400 --> 18:34.400]  Dude.
[18:34.400 --> 18:35.400]  Uh,
[18:35.400 --> 18:36.400]  I didn't believe in it.
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.400]  It's like,
[18:37.400 --> 18:38.400]  it was definitely,
[18:38.400 --> 18:40.400]  I was skeptical about it because I'm a pothead.
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.400]  I think you got to smoke weed or consume cannabis somehow to get high.
[18:43.400 --> 18:44.400]  Right.
[18:44.400 --> 18:45.400]  But my girlfriend,
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.400]  uh,
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.400]  actually the Grammy Gatsby gave me a bottle of that,
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.400]  uh,
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.400]  apothecary and I rubbed my girlfriend down with it for like an hour and a
[18:51.400 --> 18:52.400]  half one night.
[18:52.400 --> 18:53.400]  And my,
[18:53.400 --> 18:54.400]  uh,
[18:54.400 --> 18:55.400]  to quote Pink Floyd,
[18:55.400 --> 18:57.400]  my hands felt just like two balloons.
[18:57.400 --> 18:58.400]  They felt,
[18:58.400 --> 18:59.400]  I felt like I had Mickey mouse gloves on.
[18:59.400 --> 19:00.400]  I was like,
[19:00.400 --> 19:01.400]  Oh,
[19:01.400 --> 19:02.400]  my hands are big.
[19:02.400 --> 19:04.400]  Like they felt all like fluffy and bigger than they were dream or
[19:04.400 --> 19:05.400]  something.
[19:05.400 --> 19:06.400]  Yeah.
[19:06.400 --> 19:07.400]  Kinda.
[19:07.400 --> 19:08.400]  Yeah.
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.400]  I also rubbed myself in the head a little bit because my fingers were
[19:10.400 --> 19:11.400]  there already.
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.400]  It's like,
[19:12.400 --> 19:13.400]  what is this?
[19:13.400 --> 19:14.400]  We it's like I had boxing gloves on.
[19:14.400 --> 19:15.400]  My mom used that.
[19:15.400 --> 19:16.400]  And,
[19:16.400 --> 19:17.400]  um,
[19:17.400 --> 19:18.400]  she said she got high shit from it.
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.400]  I don't know about getting high shit from it,
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.400]  but I definitely felt my mom's a very small smoke right now.
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.400]  Okay.
[19:25.400 --> 19:26.400]  And then maybe she did.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.400]  It definitely helps.
[19:27.400 --> 19:28.400]  Uh,
[19:28.400 --> 19:29.400]  I start off the massage with just coconut oil to kind of,
[19:29.400 --> 19:30.400]  uh,
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.400]  start a massage and get her loosened up and get her lubed.
[19:32.400 --> 19:33.400]  I didn't,
[19:33.400 --> 19:35.400]  I was trying to avoid the word blue.
[19:35.400 --> 19:36.400]  And then if I use that apothecary right away,
[19:36.400 --> 19:37.400]  it absorbs in too quickly.
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.320]  quickly and I don't think it spreads enough so I get her coconut oiled and
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.520]  then I put the apothecary in there definitely I can tell it she can I can
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.400]  see that she loosens up as soon as that apothecary starts getting in there
[19:46.400 --> 19:51.200]  it's what I had to use that word there was just nothing else that describe it
[19:51.200 --> 19:55.880]  he knew he gets it he didn't want to use Luke but I didn't want to use the word
[19:55.880 --> 19:58.760]  Lou but sometimes you got to take that job and say words that you're trying to
[19:58.760 --> 20:03.200]  avoid a lot of people don't like the word moist I've noticed moist like
[20:03.200 --> 20:10.120]  really it's the way some people say it moist like a properly like you've been
[20:10.120 --> 20:14.560]  using that spray like you've been using that cannabis spray maybe all right
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.440]  we're gonna try to put this show back on track here's another article from the
[20:18.440 --> 20:22.640]  cannabis this current can't I'm so fucking lost I can't even talk I still
[20:22.640 --> 20:28.120]  got this Kleenex in my nose to face stamp on this article is written by John
[20:28.120 --> 20:32.120]  Engle and Jordan Stefan from the Denver Post the headline is hash oil legality
[20:32.120 --> 20:36.440]  now questioned for Colorado courts and then the sub headline is by the end of
[20:36.440 --> 20:40.760]  Wednesday hearing Denver District Court Judge a Bruce Jones had concluded both
[20:40.760 --> 20:44.360]  sides were wrong though it was still unclear how he would ultimately rule
[20:44.360 --> 20:50.400]  side note students name is a Bruce Jones bad motherfucker if your first name is
[20:50.400 --> 20:56.200]  just an initial it's actually a type of graphical error let led me be called or
[20:56.200 --> 21:03.280]  led me being called D for like two and a half years during public school that's
[21:03.280 --> 21:09.120]  frustrating yeah this dude chose to do it he's a Bruce Jones he chose to do it
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.720]  or his parents just tagged so I guess if I wanted to be a poet or something my
[21:12.720 --> 21:16.200]  middle name is Scott so I'd be Jay Scott and then my last name I almost said it
[21:16.200 --> 21:21.440]  on the show but I ain't gonna do that Jayce Jay Scott Rasta
[21:21.440 --> 21:27.000]  you don't have to change your name that sounds really sophisticated is that what
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.840]  he's trying to do there is or is this first name just like 17 letters and
[21:31.840 --> 21:38.840]  starts with a it's so funny their little nickname for me at work and shit is what
[21:38.840 --> 21:43.520]  I used to get teased as as like five and I mean that's what used to hurt you know
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.760]  like when you're a kid and the kids find that one thing oh yeah like you go at it
[21:47.760 --> 21:53.280]  forever dude I mean I'm an adult now so it's fine but you know there's those
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.240]  times where it's both of them sitting in the corner listen you're trying to
[21:56.240 --> 22:02.240]  remember what year the Joe Dirt was released it was when you were five that
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.520]  was actually that was shot from afar they just followed me around so if I've
[22:06.520 --> 22:09.900]  killed dirt and if you guy don't know if you guys watch King of the Hill but if
[22:09.900 --> 22:15.240]  lucky from King of the Hill and Joe Dirt had a kid it would be Adam yeah and his
[22:15.240 --> 22:24.080]  name would be 44 44 dear D I've been calling him Joe Dirt lately for a whole
[22:24.080 --> 22:31.720]  another reason dang he's a handy little mother do you want to tell the story
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.200]  about what you did with your shatter the other day oh yeah anybody out there
[22:36.200 --> 22:39.520]  that's a little inexperienced I'm from the south I've not been dabbing that
[22:39.520 --> 22:45.880]  long but so I took shatter to work and I was like oh it's all cold and we we
[22:45.880 --> 22:49.200]  got in the car and I'm sitting there and I'm like let's let's do a dab let's you
[22:49.200 --> 22:54.400]  know yeah that doesn't work so I trying it's shattering everywhere and I'm
[22:54.400 --> 22:57.360]  spilling it I probably lost half a gram that way and I was like you know what
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.000]  I'll do I'll pick it up I'll hold the torch and I'll just you know waft it and
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  I'll use my thumb is like a guard to protect the heat and that worked fine
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.800]  that works great you were attempting to blowtorch the hash lightly to kind of
[23:09.800 --> 23:13.600]  melt it a little bit to make it more correctly in between two pieces of
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.840]  parchment paper all right this is some high-quality concentrates he's done yeah
[23:17.840 --> 23:26.120]  and this is Colorado it's definitely some of the best hash around you know
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.440]  town and stuff so I fucked it up I was like this is working I'll just set it
[23:31.440 --> 23:39.000]  down and do the same thing listen to me people don't do that hold it yeah I
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.680]  burned a bunch of money that day for nothing it just went up and flame it was
[23:43.680 --> 23:48.960]  way too late by that part you know like yeah it's like a match book I felt bad
[23:48.960 --> 23:53.360]  for you no nobody else did they all laughed I learned something so I learned
[23:53.360 --> 24:01.240]  yeah no it was told I laughed later it wasn't funny to him in the moment but it
[24:01.240 --> 24:06.480]  was great and we'll continue to be great break time really sucked at that
[24:06.480 --> 24:10.360]  point time and I break yeah I was like I was done with the day anybody bring any
[24:10.360 --> 24:16.560]  shatter no because I'm out because I'm broke because you burned it all yeah
[24:16.560 --> 24:24.440]  that was an expensive fucking day I've got some unicorn hash I'm actually
[24:24.440 --> 24:29.720]  dabbed up all my unicorn hash last night I got a little half-naked container for
[24:29.720 --> 24:35.080]  Friday I forget what we saw today but we saw a unicorn it was it was just
[24:35.080 --> 24:40.480]  rarity it was on the way to work I can't don't remember what it was now I'll ask
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.280]  in the morning what we saw of it you saw it was definitely unicorn status you saw
[24:45.280 --> 24:47.720]  something that was so cool you don't even know what the fuck it was no it's
[24:47.720 --> 24:52.840]  rare you know that's that's weird yeah I said I was gonna read a news article I'm
[24:52.840 --> 24:57.520]  gonna take a dab and then try that this is gonna be like my third dab of the day
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.680]  when it's 915 usually I start off the day with a couple of fat dads if that's
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.200]  okay anything about how I felt today I've been trying to get hydrated dude
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.360]  it's so hard to get hydrated once you're dehydrated don't drink that then don't
[25:11.360 --> 25:17.520]  drink this yeah the bong water just like yeah we're talking about being hydrated
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.080]  and pick up the rig that'd be great thanks for being a friend that would've
[25:20.080 --> 25:25.200]  been miserable there's probably like a good gram of reclaim just float on top
[25:25.200 --> 25:28.400]  of that shit that would've been the worst drink ever anybody out there would
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.360]  definitely pay money to just like scrape your your pipes you know and your
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.640]  reclaim there's I was on tiny chat last night and I showed somebody my hash no
[25:38.640 --> 25:43.760]  and he's like is that your dad and I was like no and he goes just dab it and so I
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.880]  weighed it and it was 0.5 and I was like well okay and so I typed it's 0.5 and he
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.200]  just nodded like uh-huh then I was like god damn it this guy knows me and so I
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.200]  did a half gram dab last night on tiny chat and it was fun and then I went to
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.360]  bed yeah sometimes I am on bong TV live guys that is me if you wondered but if
[26:01.360 --> 26:03.760]  you're ever cruising through bong TV live and you see that white guy with the

[27:36.160 --> 27:41.720]  of his hands yeah you probably pick them right here in front of my hair break bro
[27:41.720 --> 27:46.520]  it uh yeah it's on my as long as it doesn't have anything with me putting my
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.280]  hands over my head it can burn whatever that's the worst part of your guys's job
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.520]  from what I've heard is hanging drywall and metal beams above your head all day
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.360]  doing anything above your head everyone just went silent after that I'm totally
[27:59.360 --> 28:06.880]  down to carry soil or water or whatever because it's below my waist dude at the
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.120]  new girl at the spot there's no like carrion there are carts like you know
[28:11.120 --> 28:15.160]  the janitor cart I got one of those for all my shit like just push it around or
[28:15.160 --> 28:21.720]  I'm sure they'll be there eventually yeah yeah I'm just I'm so excited to
[28:21.720 --> 28:27.160]  have upgraded from my smaller facilities and I've gone from one of my first
[28:27.160 --> 28:32.960]  grows was in my mom's basement in the closet in a grow hut like a little tiny
[28:32.960 --> 28:39.200]  tiny and now I've got if you combine a bucket of water yeah that's all it took
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.960]  yeah flush the plants by carrying them to the bathtub and just rinse them out a
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.160]  little bit where do you guys getting that oil on you from or is it coming
[28:47.160 --> 28:51.960]  from on there I'll clean it up if you can identify the leak I think it's just
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.160]  coming out of the carb cap honestly I probably is the carb cap now that you
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.400]  say that everything over here is just dirty I had to you think you dirty yeah
[29:01.400 --> 29:06.400]  I know I cleaned yours the other day I need a cleaner monkey that just walks
[29:06.400 --> 29:09.920]  around behind me and cleans up after me all day let me tell you people if you
[29:09.920 --> 29:16.960]  think you smoke a lot of tabs like there are resin I mean there's fucking reclaim
[29:16.960 --> 29:25.880]  coming off the end of the torch here yeah that's true I've got five oil slick
[29:25.880 --> 29:30.200]  pads on the table all just stained to shit don't get it all stuck together
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.720]  carb caps in right in the middle of the table just sitting there a non picky
[29:33.800 --> 29:37.240]  person could get dabbed the fuck out of the claim stuck to my dude there's like
[29:37.240 --> 29:41.360]  beds I had someone asked me for the reclaim in my work rig the other day and
[29:41.360 --> 29:46.400]  you know it's pretty substantial it's just a cheap little rig and as long as I
[29:46.400 --> 29:51.520]  can suck through it it's cool but yeah I'd never even consider I was like I'm
[29:51.520 --> 29:56.680]  just like makes that shit with fucking 420 formula 420 or whatever get it right
[29:56.680 --> 30:00.800]  out of there gone I've seen a lot of people make edibles out of the reclaim
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.720]  yeah yeah that doesn't sound nasty all right all this BHO talk leads me right
[30:06.720 --> 30:10.120]  into this news article that I was attempting to read so that's perfect
[30:10.120 --> 30:13.320]  yeah you're gonna hear a couple of weird breaths for me I can feel my nose trying
[30:13.320 --> 30:17.720]  to run all right it says the court hearing Wednesday to determine the legal
[30:17.720 --> 30:21.920]  status of marijuana hash oil in post legislation Colorado resulted in the
[30:21.920 --> 30:25.960]  judge turning up his hands and shrugging his shoulders and exasperation likes
[30:25.960 --> 30:28.640]  pulling out his phone to take a picture of me because I got this big wad of
[30:28.640 --> 30:32.760]  toilet paper stuffed in my nose while I'm doing a podcast I wasn't but now I'm
[30:32.760 --> 30:39.400]  gonna the nasal tampon the hearing in Denver District Court was to decide
[30:39.400 --> 30:45.760]  whether a man named Paul Manny Oni Manny Oni Manny Manny Oni if this guy Paul who
[30:45.760 --> 30:48.920]  was one of the three people charged after an explosion at a southwest Denver
[30:48.920 --> 30:52.040]  warehouse can be prosecuted for the crime of manufacturing marijuana
[30:52.040 --> 30:56.280]  concentrate the man's attorney Rob Corey who helped write Colorado's marijuana
[30:56.280 --> 31:00.840]  legislation law said Manny Oni can't be charged because of Colorado's
[31:00.840 --> 31:04.160]  Constitution now protects the personal possession of marijuana and the
[31:04.160 --> 31:08.960]  processing of marijuana plants the court system is not to be used for marijuana
[31:08.960 --> 31:12.120]  regulation anymore Corey said I wish he would have said cannabis it would have
[31:12.120 --> 31:16.080]  made it a lot better the Colorado Attorney General argues Manny Oni can be
[31:16.080 --> 31:20.960]  charged because by virtue of a curiously placed comma in Amendment 64 the
[31:20.960 --> 31:25.120]  legalization measure the protection for marijuana does not cover cannabis oil
[31:25.120 --> 31:30.640]  like hash oil the measure says its definition for marijuana does not
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.360]  include industrial hemp nor does it include fiber produced from the stocks
[31:34.360 --> 31:39.680]  oil or cake made from the seeds of the plant the Attorney General's office
[31:39.680 --> 31:43.440]  which weighed in on Manny Oni's case even though it is not prosecuting the
[31:43.440 --> 31:47.760]  case has made a similar argument in a case in Mesa County by the end of
[31:47.760 --> 31:52.520]  Wednesday's hearing Denver District Judge a Bruce Jones had concluded both
[31:52.680 --> 31:56.280]  sides were wrong though it was still unclear how he would ultimately rule
[31:56.280 --> 32:00.480]  Jones said he plans to deny Corey's motion to drop the charge meaning the
[32:00.480 --> 32:04.800]  case against Manny Oni can proceed and here's kind of we're getting into the
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.100]  part where it's all technical hash oil is the potent goop left over after
[32:09.100 --> 32:12.200]  marijuana's active chemicals are dissolved from the underlying plant
[32:12.200 --> 32:21.440]  material that guy tried real hard he tried hard yeah yeah cash oil is the
[32:21.440 --> 32:26.480]  hash that we want that everyone involved in this story in this article
[32:26.480 --> 32:31.880]  is it best trying hard nobody succeeded yeah the cannabis often tries really
[32:31.880 --> 32:38.320]  hard but they need somebody they need a guy like you Mike contact the cannabis
[32:38.320 --> 32:41.800]  and be like hey you guys say a lot of dumb shit like they tell their stories
[32:41.800 --> 32:46.000]  right nothing is inaccurate here except the wording hash oil is the potent goop
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.480]  left over marijuana's active chemicals are dissolved oil I mean well the oil
[32:51.480 --> 32:57.800]  that the oil the sentence in question in the bill is about hemp seed oil if you
[32:57.800 --> 33:01.400]  take hemp seed and you gather it up and you press it sort of like you do grapes
[33:01.400 --> 33:06.960]  to make wine you get in oil that you can make everything you can make with oil
[33:06.960 --> 33:11.720]  oil like Texans haul out of the ground oil and that's what they're referencing
[33:11.720 --> 33:18.240]  in that part of the bill hash oil isn't oil oil or cannabis oil we just call it
[33:18.240 --> 33:25.760]  oil because it kind of looks like it's honey oil when it comes out yeah but I
[33:25.760 --> 33:37.160]  love watching it drip over a descriptive slang term yeah the judge isn't gonna
[33:37.160 --> 33:40.520]  drop the case because I'm pretty sure this fucking up blow up his house yeah
[33:40.520 --> 33:44.400]  there's more to the story let me read part of that blowing up your house has
[33:44.400 --> 33:48.440]  long been a crime in Colorado that was not legalized at any time and that's
[33:48.440 --> 33:52.080]  something that Rob Cory mentions and I'm gonna have an argument later on in the
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.360]  story and will do I think you agree with me now no I like it I like forward
[33:55.360 --> 33:58.800]  thinking people that's awesome we don't have to sit in the backseat of our minds
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.120]  and fucking let everybody else drive us think forward so a hash oil they
[34:03.120 --> 34:06.440]  describe it wrong and then it says a popular amateur production method uses
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.120]  compressed butane gas which can lead to dangerous explosions like the one that
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.440]  rocked the 1200 block of South Lippin Street last April man Ione is also
[34:15.440 --> 34:19.360]  charged with arson in connection with that blast during Wednesday's hearing
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.000]  Cory argued that home hash oil explosions are mistakes but not illegal
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.520]  I compare it to frying a turkey Cory said accidents don't mean a crime has
[34:29.520 --> 34:33.200]  occurred Jones didn't seem impressed calling some of Cory's arguments
[34:33.200 --> 34:38.080]  circular but Jones also criticized an attorney general's position I'm going to
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.240]  tell him he's wrong I'm going to tell him he's way wrong Jones said so he
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.520]  compared it to if I'm cooking a chicken and I burn the apartment building down
[34:46.520 --> 34:52.920]  or a turkey then I made a mistake but I think I'm still recklessly endangering
[34:52.920 --> 34:56.760]  people and I think charges are gonna be pressed on me even if I do burn down my
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.440]  apartment building right if you're frying a turkey in the living room of
[35:00.440 --> 35:08.120]  your apartment and you're a an idiot be violating the fire in the kitchen well
[35:08.120 --> 35:12.120]  no the kitchen too if you're gonna fry a turkey what if I'm just cooking dinner if I'm
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.080]  cooking dinner in the kitchen and I'm just cooking normal food I got veggie
[35:16.080 --> 35:20.200]  burgers and some fucking vegetables and some rice and some macaroni or whatever
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.520]  and I fucking I take a dab and I come back in the kitchens on fire
[35:23.520 --> 35:29.400]  whoosh right am I gonna am I gonna face charges for something now no as long as
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.800]  you were just it was innocent you might you might be legally liable for like
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.240]  damages okay I don't know it depends a lot of that depends on where you are at
[35:38.240 --> 35:41.280]  the time and Mike's not Mike's not a lawyer he just stated a holiday Inn
[35:41.280 --> 35:46.760]  Express last night that part of Cory's argument here is correct but the part it
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.280]  does that doesn't apply to to butane hash oil it's your venting cans of
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.320]  flammable gas into an enclosed space which is actually an OSHA crime I think
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.760]  that's a special thing in the fire code for sure when when I asked the fire chief
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.880]  down here cuz Pueblo outlawed making a BHO a while ago and when the vote passed
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.440]  I right after the it passed I stood up and walked back to the fire chief and
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.240]  jokingly asked venting cans of butane into your living room and lighting a
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.200]  match has been illegal for how long and he chuckled and went longer than I've
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.200]  been on the job I mean cuz that's a thing you can't dump gasoline around
[36:25.200 --> 36:29.520]  your apartment and light a match and if you're venting cans of butane inside
[36:29.520 --> 36:33.240]  you're venting cans of flammable gas into an enclosed space if your pilot
[36:33.240 --> 36:37.280]  light kicks on your eyebrows are kicking off all your windows are kicking out
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.200]  you're going to the burn unit yeah the burn and not the good burn unit but
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.680]  there's not a special charge for well yeah there used to be a place we called
[36:46.680 --> 36:52.080]  the burn units where we used to go some kind of endangerment place name for a
[36:52.080 --> 36:57.600]  spot I heard a dub band once called burn unit yeah all right so I'm
[36:57.600 --> 37:01.000]  sheltered I'm gonna finish the article caught almost on the sidelines was the
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.040]  Denver District Attorney's Office which is actually prosecuting the case a
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.920]  deputy district attorney said the hash oil qualifies as pot but he said there's
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.400]  a difference between amendment 64 is protection for processing marijuana and
[37:11.400 --> 37:14.680]  the state laws for criminalizing of manufacturing concentrated marijuana
[37:14.680 --> 37:19.600]  Jones is expected to issue his ruling in the coming weeks so they're saying that
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.880]  there's a major difference between processing which is properly doing that
[37:23.880 --> 37:30.640]  shit in a facility in a tested authorized MED approved lab that's also
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.860]  been state regulated by the Health Department and like there's like seven
[37:34.860 --> 37:37.240]  different agencies that want to come in and inspect your shit if you're growing
[37:37.240 --> 37:42.480]  and making concentrates and then manufacturing concentrated marijuana he
[37:42.480 --> 37:45.520]  was doing that at his house open blasting so that I think that's where
[37:45.520 --> 37:52.360]  the where the change happens yeah so I guess the point is don't fucking blast
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.080]  indoors don't open blast if you're gonna blast get a closed loop and you can
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.240]  still fuck up do that safely there's yet to be a news story about someone hurting
[38:00.240 --> 38:06.520]  themselves making BHO outside those news stories don't happen because people don't
[38:06.520 --> 38:09.720]  get hurt that way that's kind of a good point just take it to your backyard
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.840]  numb nuts everyone I know that's never blown themselves up does it that way
[38:15.840 --> 38:23.800]  it's not complicated I was taught how to make my extracts outdoors it's pretty
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.160]  much I knew that already but they're like you always do this outside was the
[38:27.160 --> 38:31.720]  first thing they said one check the weather I don't think there's any other
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.600]  news that we should talk about something's weird with this I wouldn't
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.240]  blew up a house with alcohol here in Pueblo the other day yeah that's
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.600]  hilarious in a certain way yeah in Pueblo that's funny this is one of the
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.920]  largest alcohol we were on one of the routes for the prohibition this was a
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.840]  huge prohibition town we have tunnels under this town where people used to
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.480]  move alcohol from private houses where it was made to clubs downtown shit death
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.680]  why does it scares you bro my kids are gonna grow up here and then my kids are
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.480]  wild they're gonna find that shit I would have found that shit oh no this
[39:09.480 --> 39:17.440]  real quick they're not hidden do they're I know they're not up now those are
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.440]  different those are different tunnels I lived in a house in an area I don't even
[39:21.440 --> 39:24.960]  know if I should talk about this oh there's a part of town called goat Hill
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.320]  many years ago I don't remember the exact year so I don't want to be wrong
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.680]  and try to say I have an idea in my head but many years ago this town flooded up
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.360]  to like the third story window of a lot of buildings downtown 1916 I think it
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.640]  could have been I'll agree with you that way Jesse can be wrong and I won't 29
[39:39.640 --> 39:45.000]  but I really have no idea so a long time ago when the pictures were yellow so
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.880]  when they took pictures 1944 that's about it could have been so but this
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.560]  town flooded there's a hill near it used to be first Street now it's fucking
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.680]  center center city Drive or some city center Drive that's so dumb it's first
[39:58.840 --> 40:03.040]  why'd you change that so right up there there was a hill and it was called goat
[40:03.040 --> 40:08.240]  Hill and that's where allegedly all of the Italians that lived here went and
[40:08.240 --> 40:11.280]  moved to that top of the hill and took all their livestock there and they had
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.840]  goats up there and that part of town became known as goat Hill in my house I
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.320]  had a hatch that lifted up in my bedroom like and you could lift up that and
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.040]  you'd end up in a hidden basement part and then there was definitely a hole
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.480]  that had been bricked over and I'm pretty sure that that hole was part of
[40:29.480 --> 40:34.000]  those tunnels and then I was in a band that did a show at the Damon Runyon
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.800]  theater downtown which used to be the chief and if you go to one of the little
[40:38.800 --> 40:41.960]  back areas by the kitchen there's a tunnel that's blocked off and the
[40:41.960 --> 40:45.120]  security guard wouldn't let me go past that area because I was just in the
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.880]  opening band and he's like you can't go back here I was like I'm in the band
[40:47.880 --> 40:52.480]  he's like oh you can't go back here like all right I tried so there those tunnels
[40:52.480 --> 40:55.800]  used to be used I bet that tunnel on the tunnel I found connect somewhere
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.080]  somehow like probably this I think and the hooch was made at the top of the
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.360]  hill up on goat Hill and then it was ran and money probably like if you want to
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.840]  know why Pueblo has people in it you can watch the two documentaries on public
[41:09.840 --> 41:14.680]  Netflix one of them's prohibition and the other ones the Great Dust Bowl Ken
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.400]  Burns is amazing Ken Burns is the shit but writing those down to watch him if
[41:19.400 --> 41:25.120]  you watch both of those there's a lot of stuff here where people that move
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.760]  here like what's with that it's you know a question they ask a bunch of their
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.420]  first year and the answer is either prohibition or the Dust Bowl yeah this
[41:32.420 --> 41:36.960]  town is old-school this was a stop on the Santa Fe Trail this was used to be
[41:36.960 --> 41:42.680]  called little Chicago three four last runners meet here going all different
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.720]  directions between here in the county two major highways meet here now so now
[41:46.720 --> 41:49.880]  you get a lot of weird shit here we got highway 50 going east and west all the
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.680]  way across the country and I 25 goes north and south almost all the way
[41:53.680 --> 42:00.240]  much of a Canada I think yeah so I don't know might stop somewhere
[42:00.240 --> 42:08.040]  El Paso Texas what even got us on that we're grant that's all right
[42:08.040 --> 42:15.000]  this weird rant was brought to you by shout out to the Garden of Weedon
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.160]  I love it when I see those little envelopes the my smile goes from big to just ridiculous
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.600]  oh yeah their new packaging is definitely stylish I like it I like it
[42:23.600 --> 42:26.200]  you guys made me feel a lot better thanks for coming over and making me
[42:26.200 --> 42:29.440]  snap out of my funk I've been moping around all day I did get a little bit of
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.280]  work done I put uh I've been talking about the black cherry chempheno hunt
[42:33.280 --> 42:36.600]  that I'm doing I don't know how much I talk about it on the show I sprouted uh
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.480]  I spread 40 seeds and 35 of them made it to the flower room which is actually
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.440]  pretty impressive when that many of them make it all the way to flower that means
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.120]  that there were five like maybe I don't I don't remember exactly but some didn't
[42:50.120 --> 42:53.720]  germinate some were runts and then some I just didn't feel like they were worth
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.840]  the space so 35 of them made it to flower today I moved 11 of them into
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.560]  another room because they are males my goal is to find a purple male and a
[43:04.560 --> 43:07.440]  green male hopefully the light went off I gotta go check that it's supposed to
[43:07.440 --> 43:10.440]  go off at 9 there in a new room that got started tonight we'll see how that works
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.000]  yeah hopefully I find a purple male and a green male and hopefully I find a
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.200]  purple female and a green female and I'm going to kind of collect pollen and sort
[43:20.200 --> 43:26.440]  of cube things and see if I can't make f2s that come out consistently purple
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.800]  and I want to work them to f5 honestly that sounds ridiculous but I want to
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.960]  work them to f5 to where they're purple clones of each other when they come out
[43:33.960 --> 43:39.880]  problem we're having with that one I want the same thing so if something
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.920]  ever happens I can't get I can't get it back that's what I want I feel you dude
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.280]  strong shit I'm not sure what any of that meant but that's why we bring out I
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.040]  know that's why I just ran right nobody else did either they're all
[43:53.040 --> 44:00.240]  I didn't know anything Mike's done Mike's done immune to it now he'll we're
[44:00.240 --> 44:03.880]  working together and he turns around and glares at me 30 seconds later he
[44:03.880 --> 44:08.840]  turns around and glares again you're like a black Larry Bird
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.320]  basketball gotta be awesomely out of place sorry Mike they just do my coconut

[49:00.000 --> 49:03.320]  have to be some rules on if you get on the show then I guess you can't win

[49:39.520 --> 49:45.280]  projects so I've sent so many seeds to so many people yeah guys I was promising
[49:45.280 --> 49:52.200]  more seeds natures green remedies I I might have fucked up I seriously didn't
[49:52.200 --> 49:55.760]  make enough seeds all my friends all my are sucking up all the seeds that I made
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.560]  and honestly I'm gonna get my crew around here seeds before I mail a lot of
[50:00.560 --> 50:05.520]  shit out to a distributor it just seems like grow from the heart is my my name
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.680]  of my show it's been my motto for years and I feel like my community is right
[50:09.680 --> 50:12.960]  here and I don't need to go sending stuff out to somewhere else it helps you
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.320]  produce a better product it does because I get to see clones I get to go to these
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.040]  people's gardens I get to see what's happening guys you'll get seeds from me
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.520]  I promise I'm always making more we're working on it yeah Jesse's on the team
[50:24.520 --> 50:29.720]  now he's making more I've got breeding space somewhere else now I promise I'm
[50:29.720 --> 50:32.560]  always making more just hard to keep up dude you guys are hungry for the seeds
[50:32.560 --> 50:39.520]  thank you and I apologize what I can yeah it's yeah it's hard to I've been
[50:39.520 --> 50:42.760]  one seed since I've been here I've just never had money but at the time you know
[50:42.760 --> 50:45.640]  he's like look at all these she's gonna hold table full seeds he's like so which
[50:45.640 --> 50:50.160]  ones you want I'm like the the ones that you're throwing away over there would be
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.840]  cool you know the ruts yeah maybe I'll get one of those to sprout but yeah
[50:54.840 --> 50:58.160]  everything is kind of a pain in the ass like I'm we know how to do it we've done
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.360]  it enough but getting your mail started and then if I put three or four or four
[51:02.360 --> 51:05.880]  or five females in the room with that male sometimes they have to go into
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.920]  flower four or five six or seven eight or ten days apart from each other to
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.440]  time up when the females are ovulating to take that pollen for sure and
[51:14.440 --> 51:19.520]  different males don't at different times honestly what I did I'll admit this I
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.280]  make my own silver thiosulfate and I tried a new method and I over applied
[51:23.280 --> 51:28.760]  and my male plants turned male super quick quicker than I've ever seen but at
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.140]  the same time they didn't make any pollen they made some but not nearly as
[51:33.140 --> 51:36.840]  much as I had anticipated not what I'm used to so I got about a quarter amount
[51:36.840 --> 51:39.920]  of the seeds I expected to tell you the truth I'm man enough to say that on the
[51:39.920 --> 51:43.800]  show I don't fucked up y'all but I learned from it not to do that again
[51:43.800 --> 51:51.120]  mistakes also high-level mistake too so yeah if you're making that you know yeah
[51:51.120 --> 51:55.360]  yeah I'm not even I don't think you're beating yourself up no I know not to do
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.680]  that I over and I sprayed too many times and I made it too strong and
[51:59.680 --> 52:04.440]  sprayed too many times we're back to the number of sprays I remember the issue
[52:04.440 --> 52:08.120]  you were going through and everything yeah yeah I solved that issue yeah
[52:08.120 --> 52:11.720]  created a whole new mess of problems for myself doing it don't spray your hash
[52:11.720 --> 52:17.000]  with the torch see we're all learning shit yeah yeah you don't learn or if you
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.600]  don't fuck up you don't learn that's what I think I taught you that yeah I
[52:20.600 --> 52:23.320]  think I've said that now if I taught you that but I everybody's taught me that
[52:23.320 --> 52:27.320]  life has taught me that yeah yeah but I fucked up on a big scale like I was
[52:27.320 --> 52:30.960]  going big and I kind of ruined some shit by doing it but we all do it made a lot
[52:30.960 --> 52:34.440]  of good hash learn those plants that did not get seeded made a hell of a lot of
[52:34.440 --> 52:41.120]  good hash so that works everybody get your cannabis cup tickets the Denver
[52:41.120 --> 52:44.760]  Cannabis Cup is coming I'm not endorsed by high times I'm not paid to say this I

[55:27.600 --> 55:30.440]  you're rocking shorts and a t-shirt and then you get in the car and you go eat
[55:30.440 --> 55:33.800]  dinner and you go to the hotel and you got to change into like pants and long
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.280]  sleeves and a hoodie and put some chapstick on your lips because we went
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.440]  out to Red Rocks for slightly stupid and I'm not dissing the shows guys we went
[55:40.440 --> 55:44.520]  out to Red Rocks and it was so windy go see slightly stupid at Red Rocks just
[55:44.520 --> 55:50.400]  not on 420 yeah yeah that's for sure I've never heard anyone say don't yeah
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.040]  I wouldn't go see them at Red Rocks anytime anybody seen anybody at Red Rocks
[55:55.040 --> 56:00.360]  oh yeah January 30th at Red Rocks is Damian Marley and a couple of other bands
[56:00.360 --> 56:07.560]  yeah man people are gonna freeze their dicks out there doing shows out there

[56:14.920 --> 56:20.200]  maybe after an aparka evil joke just had a whole bunch of cool running running
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.320]  smell that's probably coinciding with that X Games shit or something else
[56:25.320 --> 56:28.520]  going on you know I don't know for sure but I would just assume that's the way
[56:28.520 --> 56:31.520]  that's like to do it they piggyback on each other just to make money and they
[56:31.520 --> 56:34.760]  make it seem like it's just a nice casual probably gonna heat from breakage
[56:34.760 --> 56:40.440]  by now you know heated stage out there to Red Rocks is treacherous yeah yeah
[56:40.440 --> 56:45.120]  could you imagine all the fucking ice demelter shit they're gonna have to

[01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:49.670]  brought up a really interesting topic I saw it you guys might have seen it on
[01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:54.550]  TMZ I saw it online this morning Ralphie May came to Colorado it had himself a
[01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:59.950]  little accident with some edibles right before a performance apparently the
[01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:03.910]  police had to be called to quiet there of the pissed crowd when Ralphie was way
[01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:08.670]  too zonked to even finish a sentence they showed video of Ralphie May being
[01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:12.630]  escorted out of the back of the comedy club by the police because the crowd was
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.190]  so pissed off at him they were demanding their money back and he was just smiling
[01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:19.550]  and like I love you guys I don't know what happened you wouldn't let me do my
[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:23.670]  bits and he was waving like he was a princess or some shit was really fucking
[01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:27.990]  funny I've seen Ralphie May high as shit before and I have never seen Ralphie May
[01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:31.630]  that high he talked about doing a lot of drugs you got to read the labels people
[01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:37.670]  read the label yeah they didn't say small it's not I mean fun size read the
[01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.150]  label yeah well you know it's Ralphie May he probably ate something and went
[01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:44.590]  damn this is delicious and just started eating all of them did that happen
[01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:48.830]  sometimes the arm eats for you you don't even know you're doing it he's kind of a
[01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.990]  big dude so he probably thought a thousand milligrams ain't shit for me
[01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:57.270]  oops just the same size as everybody else's all right shout out to Ralphie
[01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.990]  May this episode won't be out for like two weeks so that'll be old news by then
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.350]  but we read it today we thought it was freaking hilarious Ralphie May you're
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:06.230]  the new Maureen O'Dowd I hope you work that into your next bit I hope that's
[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:12.150]  funny at some point that's good yeah tonight it'll be too late but the new
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:15.190]  Ari Shafir comedy special is on at midnight tonight I'm gonna catch that
[01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:20.750]  yeah paid regular with Ari one of my favorite comedians when Spence was here
[01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:24.990]  last time we talked about the best shit of the year 2014 and we left out
[01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:28.990]  something super duper freaking important what was that we didn't even mention
[01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:37.150]  live resin oh yeah yeah only reason we probably didn't talk about is because
[01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:44.310]  it's nothing new to us yeah but it was like the thing for 2014 we talked to
[01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:48.630]  people today that were like I still haven't seen any live resin and then
[01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.750]  just Joe Blow like pulls them out of his pocket like you know I got some right
[01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:57.510]  here you know and it's just like you guys it's like oh he's one you know to
[01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:04.070]  enter some shit to a competition and it's like you just won yeah yeah no live
[01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:08.590]  resin is definitely a big pickup on something new especially with you know
[01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:11.830]  the addition of closed loop it kind of really came about
[01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:16.590]  shout out to emo tech yeah shout out to giddy emo tech kind bill that whole
[01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:22.110]  crew that kind of you know put the put the forward push yeah live resin did a
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:26.430]  lot for you of course it did a lot for emo and giddy I did a lot for Hanky B in
[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:31.350]  the greener side kind of as a residual it actually your win in the secret cup
[01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:35.510]  boosted up my Instagram follow it made me more known so yeah live resin kind of
[01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:39.670]  boosted us all up in the in the scene a little bit yeah for sure I mean I can't
[01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:43.110]  believe we forgot about live on the year review episode yeah that was big yeah
[01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:46.310]  huge Maddie's shaking her head all flabbergasted I can't believe we did
[01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:50.150]  either that was such a big part of the end of our year especially with the
[01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:54.670]  secret cup so and it was awesome to win the secret cup regionals that was
[01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:59.630]  awesome we met a lot of people in Denver through that yeah then people
[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.190]  still talk to me like I'm part of your crew like you grew that well and I'm
[01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:06.950]  like I didn't grow it do that's they grow it they fucking pop the seeds they
[01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:11.070]  shatter it they blasted it's all them so I have to correct people and I let them
[01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:14.070]  know that you grew that I never take credit for your guys's girl I didn't
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:18.630]  grow that stuff you guys it was them soiled oil yeah actually the stuff for I
[01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:22.750]  may have grown a couple of theirs but I've taken credit for those so this is
[01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:27.310]  kind of a random note a lady messaged me on Instagram and kind of called me
[01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:31.430]  out she said that and I'm sure I said this but I don't remember the exact
[01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.310]  words in an older episode I kind of tried to cover my ass legally with the
[01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:38.670]  disclaimer like if you live in an illegal state don't grow weed follow the
[01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:42.910]  rules and all that shit I gotta say that kind of shit to cover my ass I don't
[01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.870]  know technically if I come on the air and I say hey if you live in Florida
[01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:48.790]  fuck all the rules girl the weed you can I don't know if I'm gonna get in trouble
[01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:52.350]  for that so to cover my own ass I just say follow the follow the rules you guys
[01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:55.590]  but I think that you should grow your own cannabis if you're smoking cannabis
[01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.770]  if you're consuming cannabis if you like it recreationally if you like it
[01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:02.350]  medically grow the fuck out of it everywhere that's my new stance on it
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:05.150]  overgrow the government they can't arrest us all they might arrest me for
[01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:09.030]  saying that but if they do somebody else make a badass podcast and keep this going
[01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:15.510]  for me and I mean if you are gonna do it illegally you know if you do it somewhat
[01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:18.930]  responsibly and you're willing to go to court for that then so be it I mean you
[01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:24.310]  may be the change that your state or your community yeah your community is
[01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.950]  needed so plant more seeds you guys grow more weed I can't be a hypocrite I grow
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.990]  a lot of cannabis I think you should too but also know the risks if you've got
[01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:35.430]  kids in the house you can lose the kids when the DEA comes they're gonna shoot
[01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.470]  your dog most likely when they come in the door think about that kind of shit
[01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.270]  it's gonna be traumatizing it's gonna fuck up your life if you're prepared for
[01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.950]  that if you can handle that if you're a man and or woman enough if you're a
[01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.350]  transgender enough I'm not trying to exclude anybody I'm trying to include
[01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:50.950]  all of you if you are a person enough and you can handle that shit grow
[01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.950]  cannabis do your thing just know what the risks are there we go I'm not being
[01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:59.550]  a hypocrite if you're yeah she also called me out for dabbing in the car and
[01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:03.590]  telling people not to I'm a professional lady I could dab in the car if you find
[01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:06.550]  yourself to be a professional dab in the car the people I'm talking shit to were
[01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:10.750]  not professional I'm a professional car dabber right yeah we've got a nice
[01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:14.750]  little system in my car absolutely I've been I've been there with him and it's
[01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:19.950]  always parked in very certain locations where it's like this is dab approved I
[01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:24.590]  know good spot yeah we're not pulling up next to the park like hey see those kids
[01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:31.670]  in the swing over there I understand certain places between here and like
[01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:36.350]  Boulder Longmont Broomfield Fort Collins that I know to pull off like I can pull
[01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:38.990]  off right here there's a little gas station with a car wash I love to go in
[01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:43.390]  the car wash at the gas station and get my car washed and take a dab while it's washing the car
[01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:46.390]  I've never done that before now that you've said that I have to try it
[01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.390]  nobody can see you the car is covered at all angles and you're just in there dabbing out
[01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.390]  you have the master shake too that's a perfect little car rig it's hard for the car
[01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:57.950]  master shake is a little 10 mil rig there's no way to hold it up in the car
[01:11:57.950 --> 01:12:01.270]  there's nowhere to put it it just falls over when you drive so this is mostly
[01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:06.150]  the hitman mini cake rig yeah it fits in the couple it's a pretty well okay yeah
[01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:12.390]  yeah so this is Colorado I've seen more than one email set up in a car
[01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:14.390]  shout out to Otis Dabs
[01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:18.390]  Otis is always driving with the Peli nail in the car
[01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:23.390]  you see that dude dabbing in strip clubs he also dabbed on an airplane did he really
[01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:26.390]  take the dab or did he just show off the rig I didn't see the dab part
[01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:29.390]  he took a real dab on the plane
[01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:33.390]  win winner winner winner vegan dinner
[01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.390]  with a torch or a dab?
[01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:38.390]  with a torch and took a dab in the bathroom and blew it out
[01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:43.390]  it was on Instagram I don't know if it's still there
[01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:46.390]  you have GSA on a problem with that one ejected it's security
[01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:50.390]  so shout out to that lady that called me out I guess I might have been hypocritical
[01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:53.390]  I don't encourage any of that though
[01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:56.390]  I was just trying to cover my own ass I'm trying not to go to jail and trying to keep this podcast going
[01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:00.390]  I can't tell people in Texas to grow weed and not think that I'm going to get in trouble
[01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:03.390]  but guess what if you're in Texas grow some weed dude grow it
[01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:08.390]  I would think it would be easy to figure out what her opinion was
[01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:12.390]  I don't think you really put on a role model vibe
[01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:16.390]  it's more or less you want to put the correct information out there for people
[01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:20.390]  yeah well she called me out and I guess she was right because I did say don't do this
[01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:23.390]  and I guess I can't be a bitch about it just want to man up to that one
[01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:26.390]  where was I going to go from there
[01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:29.390]  do we want to start this big old list of shout outs I'm only like 11 minutes into the show

[01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:36.390]  if you guys Mike if you got anybody that you want to shout out or say anything to

[01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:44.390]  everyone's looking at their phones like shout out to you bud 50's huge
[01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:49.390]  right well thank you guys for coming all of you guys are Clint and Sean should be here but there aren't enough chairs dude
[01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:53.390]  if I had two more chairs Sean and Clint would have been my next options to have here
[01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:57.390]  I want to save Sean for when it's just kind of focused we can talk about some shit
[01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:59.390]  and Clint would just derail the whole thing
[01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:05.390]  yeah that'd be kind of fun just to have them both on and Clint sit there and poke fun at him the whole time
[01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:06.390]  he not know what to do
[01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:08.390]  keep going bro I'm sorry I totally interrupted you bad host
[01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:11.390]  that's all I got right now it's yeti OG dabs
[01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:12.390]  nice
[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.390]  I wasn't expecting to
[01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:15.390]  to be put on the spot
[01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:20.390]  yeah definitely 50's huge man I've been looking forward to this for a while thanks for the microphone
[01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:25.390]  oh man thanks for coming on and you keep us updated with our local politics and the local shit that we need to be aware of
[01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:30.390]  and I think that reminding us about our local stuff teaches our listeners that they can participate too
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:32.390]  and it gets them off the couch which is what we need
[01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.390]  you can be an activist in so many ways but you gotta get off the couch to do it
[01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:40.390]  be ready to do local political work if marijuana is getting legalized in your state
[01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:46.390]  as soon as it's legal at the state level all sorts of nightmarish work begins at the local level with the city and county level
[01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:52.390]  if you don't have somebody in your crew ready to step up on that it's not gonna go the way you want it to
[01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:54.390]  and you're looking at local bands like Colorado Springs
[01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:58.390]  I'm impressed with how friendly you have become with some city council members
[01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:02.390]  we'll be hanging out taking dabs and the phone will ring and he'll be like oh that's this city council member
[01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:06.390]  excuse me for a minute and I'm like bro you're at my house taking dabs listening to reggae
[01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:10.390]  and you're gonna excuse yourself to go talk to the city council manager
[01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:15.390]  they're people too bro if you call them they call you back
[01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:20.390]  their job is to keep the constituents happy and it doesn't matter how often you dab you're a constituent
[01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:24.390]  it's pretty killer I like that you've developed that relationship for us because I know it's not my spot
[01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:28.390]  it's fully my cross to bear I can see why it's like my wheelhouse
[01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:34.390]  and honestly I don't see myself knowing what you know about growing or knowing what Spence knows about Blast
[01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:37.390]  and it's just I know about zoning
[01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.390]  so not sexy
[01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.390]  we need someone like that
[01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:42.390]  it's all good
[01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.390]  me doing your job
[01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:44.390]  speaking of zoning
[01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:48.390]  both of you looking at me going thank fucking god you're here cause I ain't gonna fucking do it
[01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:49.390]  everybody needs someone like you
[01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:54.390]  I go to city council meetings occasionally and I know I don't go enough but I'm intimidated dude
[01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:58.390]  it's like going in like hi I'm the pot grower and it just feels weird
[01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.390]  you get some looks
[01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:04.390]  some looks I got Jedi stared for half the session last time
[01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:08.390]  dude with the stars on his chest was like I don't like you
[01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.390]  burning holes in my shirt
[01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:14.390]  Jesse that's a killer shirt by the way shout out to Heavy 16 for all the goodies we get to give away from them
[01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.390]  do you got anybody to thank or any shout outs for the show?
[01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:19.390]  I know we're only like 11 minutes in
[01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:22.390]  Yeti OG, Live Resin,
[01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:24.390]  yeah there you go, nice
[01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:27.390]  my beautiful wife
[01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:29.390]  there you go, congrats on the wedding this year
[01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.390]  that was one of the coolest weddings and if not the coolest wedding I've ever been to
[01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:37.390]  that was by far the drunkest I've ever been at a wedding that was pretty weird
[01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:41.390]  Maddie and I got to give out Live Res dabs to everybody all night that was kind of fun
[01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.390]  full on dab bar
[01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:47.390]  full on dab bar she doesn't have a mic but most of you guys probably caught that from the echo in the room
[01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:51.390]  I had someone ask me to plan their reception for them the other day actually
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.390]  does that mean we get to go?
[01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:55.390]  you gotta hire us to check
[01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:00.390]  it's pretty easy you just show up with a bunch of hash, shit ton of beer
[01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:02.390]  you're starting another impromptu company now?
[01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.390]  oh Jesus
[01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:05.390]  hey, hash weddings
[01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.390]  alright
[01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.390]  so Maddie just grabbed the mic from Spence it looks like she's prepared
[01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.390]  you got any shout outs for the girl over there?
[01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:17.390]  I wanted to give a huge shout out to our crew from NC in Colorado
[01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:19.390]  they really stepped up their game this year
[01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:23.390]  and all learned how to grow some killer weed
[01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:27.390]  granted they have some good friends to help them learn
[01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:31.390]  but our friends really stepped up and started growing some amazing cannabis this year
[01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:35.390]  they deserve a big shout out for that
[01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:37.390]  good genetics go a long way also
[01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:39.390]  I've seen a lot I'm kind of going to brag on that
[01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:41.390]  yeah shout out to all those guys because a lot of them
[01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.390]  you guys have passed on iRegenetic seeds to a lot of that crew
[01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:48.390]  and they are freaking killing it on Instagram so you're totally right
[01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:54.390]  we love to suggest iRegenetics it's a great place to get reliable genetics from
[01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:56.390]  well thank you
[01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:57.390]  no problem
[01:18:57.390 --> 01:19:01.390]  I wish I could give unfortunately there aren't any seeds in the prize packages
[01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.390]  because of legal reasons
[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.390]  these prizes are available to almost anybody in the United States
[01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.390]  unless you're here at the table or you're too closely affiliated with the show
[01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:11.390]  by the way I make the fucking rules and they can change anytime I decide they change
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:13.390]  mad jealous for that
[01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:15.390]  these prize packs are sick guys
[01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:17.390]  I don't even remember where I was headed with that
[01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:19.390]  yeah anyway anybody can get the prizes
[01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:22.390]  so there can't be seeds in there that's what I was saying
[01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.390]  there can't be seeds in there I'm sorry
[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:27.390]  I will make a Colorado local contest where I can put some iRi seeds in there eventually
[01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:30.390]  I just got to figure out how to do that it'll just be a local thing
[01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.390]  so yeah big shout out to all those guys
[01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:34.390]  dude Maddie you sound great on a microphone
[01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:36.390]  you need to be podcasting all the time
[01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:37.390]  thank you
[01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:38.390]  yeah you're nice
[01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:43.390]  well I have a we have a discussion table every night when we take daps
[01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:48.390]  we usually just have a session sit down and talk for an hour or two and just bullshit
[01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:51.390]  and honestly it could be on a podcast so
[01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:55.390]  that's why I've said it before on the show that your table was part of what inspired this podcast
[01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.390]  your guys' friend I won't say his name
[01:19:57.390 --> 01:20:00.390]  he used to come and pick my brain for two hours at a time at your table
[01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:05.390]  and then I thought I should record all this or write it down and just refer him to my recordings
[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.390]  I wish I could just bring thoughts back that I have
[01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:11.390]  like I remember something we were talking about but I don't remember the specifics
[01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:14.390]  one time on an older podcast that I used to do
[01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:16.390]  shout out to 719 the blocks
[01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:20.390]  on that podcast we had a recording issue and our whole recording got lost
[01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:23.390]  and we decided let's just try to redo it and mimic it
[01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:27.390]  about 10 minutes in we're like this feels so fake there's no way to bring back those thoughts in that conversation
[01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:32.390]  so we just gave up we're like no so remaking a talk isn't it's not the most legit thing
[01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:37.390]  we've sat here and tried to make a podcast four or five times in one night and it just didn't work
[01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:42.390]  yeah it was about episode 13 or 15 ish around that area
[01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:44.390]  I don't know if it was dabs or just sleep
[01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.390]  everything's better when it's not forced
[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:50.390]  I wasn't feeling it like it was time to record and I just wasn't in the mood
[01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:54.390]  and now I'm way more comfortable at it so 50 episodes in on this show
[01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:59.390]  and then I did about 50 with another show also so I had some time to get comfortable
[01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:02.390]  I've only been a host for 50 episodes I feel like I've only been a host for about 30 episodes
[01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:05.390]  to tell you the truth it took me about 20-25 to get there
[01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:06.390]  it flew by
[01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:09.390]  yeah I'm thinking about doing more frequent episodes
[01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:13.390]  because we get more listens when they're more frequent but I don't want to bore people also
[01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:17.390]  I don't want to be that podcast that disappears for three months and then comes out with a show
[01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:21.390]  and then comes out and apologizes
[01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:24.390]  but then I also don't want you to have to listen to me four times a week like Joe Rogan
[01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:27.390]  because I don't even have time to hear all the Joe Rogan stuff
[01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:28.390]  Joe Rogan's a busy dude
[01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:29.390]  yeah yeah
[01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:32.390]  alright Spence just grabbed the mic from Maddie he smacked her with it violently
[01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.390]  it's acute violence when they do it
[01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.390]  how about you Spence you got any shout outs for the year?
[01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:41.390]  let's see
[01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:49.390]  shout out to all the people who breed seeds and give me free seeds to grow
[01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:50.390]  I appreciate that
[01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:56.390]  and the people that hook me up with legit genetics
[01:21:56.390 --> 01:22:02.390]  I've had genetics from California, Seattle so shout out to all the people out there that have passed on genetics
[01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:09.390]  now it's kind of something that should be done now is share the genetics for people
[01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:13.390]  there's always going to be cuts people are going to hold that's just how it works
[01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:15.390]  but you can still share at the same time
[01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:22.430]  sharing is great here
[01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:27.430]  it's all good I just tried to step in somebody had to do something here
[01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:31.430]  the host goes to take a dab and all this just looked at it awingly
[01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.430]  my carb cap was clogged so I was choking on it too
[01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:37.430]  that was weak
[01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:39.430]  I'm going to clean that out a little bit
[01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:41.430]  sharing is good here in Colorado
[01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:42.430]  gotta keep it clean
[01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:48.430]  try not to be a clone hoarder and I know that's hypocritical because I'm a breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder
[01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:52.430]  everybody's going to keep your special genetics but everybody's got those couple that
[01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:55.430]  if you got something that's high in CBD or is really good medicine get it out there
[01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:56.430]  if it's medicine share
[01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.430]  well cuts are one thing seeds are another
[01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:00.430]  yeah seeds are available
[01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:03.430]  I think seeds should be given out
[01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:07.430]  that's part of why you guys are frustrated with me there's not a lot of stuff at naturesgreenremedies.com
[01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.430]  it's because all my locals are getting it
[01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:14.430]  there is obviously a markup when you go through a dealer or distributor
[01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:19.430]  and I'm skipping that markup and getting the seeds to my locals at wholesale prices because it feels good doing that
[01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:22.430]  sorry that you guys didn't get a lot on natures green remedies
[01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:26.430]  you'll get the next whole batch will probably go to you because my locals are served up everybody's fed
[01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:34.430]  and I mean 9 times out of 10 that's a lot of times 90% you would say would go to natures green remedies and only 5% stays here
[01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:39.430]  yeah and then all my friends are like where are the seeds and I'm like you have to go online like everyone else and it feels rude
[01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:41.430]  that was kind of our Christmas this year
[01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:47.430]  sorry we're all going to take turns joking because the dads are going around in a circle
[01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:51.430]  was that your shout out you concluded with the sharers the people that share
[01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:52.430]  yeah
[01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:54.430]  your eyes are as red as your microphone
[01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:58.430]  everybody in this room is quite dad dad
[01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:02.430]  we showed up here everyone showed up right about 7 10 and it's just now 8 10
[01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:05.430]  so we took a little pre preparing session
[01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:07.430]  Adam how about yourself bro you got any shout outs
[01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:13.430]  man you brother like you've I've only been here a year and I mean I met you quickly
[01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:18.430]  but man you know like without you I wouldn't be in the scene that I'm in
[01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:22.430]  Jesse you know you fed my family brother like straight up
[01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:25.430]  Mike thanks for doing the work
[01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:28.430]  you man next year
[01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.430]  appreciate it
[01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:30.430]  he pointed at Spence for that one
[01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:36.430]  yeah sorry the microphone can't see it but next year I got your back I know what you're capable of brother
[01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:37.430]  thank you
[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:40.430]  man it's good to have you
[01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:41.430]  yeah definitely
[01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:43.430]  welcome to Colorado welcome to the crew like it's definitely
[01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:45.430]  we need a southerner
[01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:48.430]  and I mean my wife for putting up with
[01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:49.430]  my wife
[01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:51.430]  yeah dude she's struggling here
[01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:52.430]  this is my wife
[01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:53.430]  you know but
[01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:57.430]  Christy
[01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:58.430]  what's up Christy
[01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:03.430]  you'll be you'll be alright I'm doing everything for the fams so it's it'll come around
[01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:07.430]  it's gotta be hard you guys move from another state and she doesn't have anybody
[01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:09.430]  she's not just look at us we did it two years ago
[01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:10.430]  yeah I am dude
[01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:14.430]  but she's not a social butterfly like us she's really she's kind of shyer than we are
[01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:16.430]  so I understand why she's having a hard time
[01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:17.430]  she can't just talk to people like we do
[01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:20.430]  she just lost her job and shit so it's been kind of
[01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:23.430]  you know she I'm proud of her for quitting her job to tell you the truth
[01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:24.430]  I am too
[01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.430]  shout out for stepping away from a nightmare
[01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:28.430]  she grabbed her balls and she fucking used them and I'm proud of her for that
[01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:32.430]  she's been there for four years it's not like she hasn't put up with enough pizza hut's bullshit
[01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:36.430]  hey Christy I pick on you bro but I'm proud of you for quitting that job because that shit was treating you like shit and you deserve better
[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:42.430]  and not only that but like I said the other day in the in the Facebook post that she walks the kids to school every morning in snow
[01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:47.430]  you know she's never dealt with snow at all so you know props to her and everything that she does
[01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:48.430]  yeah
[01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:49.430]  shout out to all the moms out there
[01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:51.430]  shout out to all the moms what's up mom
[01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:52.430]  shout out to my mama
[01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:53.430]  yeah
[01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:55.430]  everybody here has got a pretty good mama
[01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:59.430]  alright I've got a big list of
[01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:01.430]  I've got a big list of shout outs I want to give here
[01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:05.430]  dude thanks all the people that said thanks to me thanks that makes me blush it makes me feel honored
[01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:07.430]  you can't be
[01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:13.430]  somebody taught me that you are the sum of the five people that you surround yourself the most on purpose
[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:16.430]  five people sitting at this table with me
[01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:18.430]  that's an honor
[01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:19.430]  for real
[01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.430]  yeah you know
[01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:21.430]  nice
[01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:28.430]  yeah so I don't remember who taught me that it may have been Cliff Ravenscraft is where I heard it but somebody else taught him
[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:34.430]  it might have been Michael Hyatt it doesn't matter but yeah that's the five people that you surround yourself with the most on purpose
[01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:41.430]  are who you become and there are five people sitting around me that I'm inspired by all of you everyday just a little bit
[01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:43.430]  Maddie's looking at me like you're inspired by me fuck yeah dude
[01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:46.430]  no your friends have a big influence on you so I completely understand that
[01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:47.430]  absolutely
[01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:53.430]  and I completely agree with that same statement I've never really thought about it like that before so that's why I was staring at you I was like hmm
[01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:57.430]  I'm sitting here trying to think of my five and most of them are at this table so
[01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:59.430]  friends have always been my family
[01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:02.430]  that's why I'm listening to Red Gate for the last two years
[01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:09.430]  yeah and of course Angela would be if there was another person to be here that would contribute to who I have been lately Angela would be
[01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:12.430]  if Maddie and Spence were a person
[01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:14.430]  we're just Garden of Whedon
[01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:20.430]  yeah if they were Garden of Whedon then Angela would probably be number five that shapes my stuff
[01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:24.430]  so I've got a huge huge freaking list of shoutouts that I want to give here
[01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:28.430]  I'm looking to see how much time I'm into this episode because I don't want to take like four minutes doing shoutouts but I'm gonna
[01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:30.430]  I just want to do prizes
[01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:33.430]  yeah right that's cool that's probably the next part here
[01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:41.430]  so let's see I said it first Angela she keeps me smiling and inspired Maddie dude you're the first woman on the show that's awesome
[01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.430]  thank you I'm happy
[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:48.430]  thanks for coming again Spence dude you keep me supplied with the dankest dabs I could ever imagine smoking
[01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.430]  I smoke a lot of hash you guys and Spence keeps me going

[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:30.430]  you are on a show saying that to people
[01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:31.430]  hey hey hey
[01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:32.430]  alright so
[01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:34.430]  man I want to thank all the listeners
[01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.430]  super huge shout out from my heart
[01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:39.430]  I grow from my heart and I thank you from my heart
[01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:41.430]  thanks for listening to 50 episodes
[01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:43.430]  we get like 6,000 listens on a huge episode
[01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:46.430]  when Sean comes on we get 6,000 people to hear this
[01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:48.430]  that's fucking insane people
[01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:50.430]  I had no idea it was that high of a number
[01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.430]  when you said that earlier I was hoping you were going to mention it now
[01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:55.430]  because I had no idea
[01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:56.430]  if you knew what my guess was
[01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.430]  it was nothing close to that
[01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:59.430]  that was awesome
[01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:01.430]  I thought maybe like 1,500
[01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:03.430]  that's what I was thinking
[01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:05.430]  but I don't think about the fact that
[01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:07.430]  it's the web
[01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:09.430]  anybody can listen to it
[01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:10.430]  anybody anywhere
[01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.430]  I sent print ads to Nature's Green Remedies
[01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:15.430]  and so everybody that bought seeds for like 3 months
[01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:17.430]  got my ad in the mail with their seeds
[01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:18.430]  that was very smart of you
[01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:19.430]  and that's around the world
[01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:21.430]  as soon as I get the new logo figured out
[01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.430]  I plan on printing up a new logo and bombing the world
[01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:25.430]  with new newsletter ads and stuff
[01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.430]  very nice
[01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:27.430]  we'll drop them everywhere
[01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:31.430]  I wonder what our crazy location listener is
[01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:34.430]  I can probably tell you by looking at the logistics on my website
[01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:35.430]  it tells me where
[01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:37.430]  I can see where everybody's IP address is
[01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:40.430]  but the problem is that people cheat on their IP addresses
[01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:42.430]  because they can't be looking at certain shit where they're from
[01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.430]  so they gotta go in somewhere else and then come back to your site
[01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:50.430]  we're listened to in Prague and Russia
[01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:53.430]  places where they don't even speak English
[01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:59.430]  anytime that I've done any kind of social media video chat
[01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:01.430]  I've always pumped that
[01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:02.430]  I've told Mike before
[01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:03.430]  those are my listens
[01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:04.430]  I'm glad you said that
[01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:06.430]  shout out to all the people on Bong TV
[01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:10.430]  I got a nice little group that I hang out with there on Bong TV
[01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:11.430]  the Stoner Army
[01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:13.430]  Doe, what up bro?
[01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:15.430]  I don't know why we've been arguing but it's a friendly argument
[01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.430]  shout out to Doe, Tripp
[01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:19.430]  I can't list them all, I forget people's D's
[01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:20.430]  all of them
[01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:21.430]  what's up guys?
[01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:22.430]  shout out to Bong TV crew

[01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.430]  that's me bro
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:25.430]  no no no
[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:26.430]  gin dread
[01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:27.430]  gin dread 420
[01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:28.430]  the other guy
[01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:29.430]  I think that's general dread
[01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:30.430]  oh ok
[01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:31.430]  I think
[01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:32.430]  shout out dude with the other dreadlocks
[01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:33.430]  there are a couple guys on with dreads lately
[01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:34.430]  you know which one I'm talking about though
[01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:35.430]  yeah
[01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:36.430]  alright so
[01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:37.430]  what I was getting at is that I love all the listeners
[01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:39.430]  and to show that appreciation
[01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:41.430]  we've got some killer prize packages
[01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:42.430]  and we want to give them away
[01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:43.430]  we sat around here for a few minutes
[01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:45.430]  trying to think about ways to give them away
[01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:47.430]  so I think this is what we're going to do
[01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.430]  I will post pictures
[01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.430]  and I'll read the prize packs here in a minute
[01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:52.430]  but I want to tell you first to keep you excited
[01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:55.430]  I will post pictures of the prize packages
[01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:57.430]  on Instagram and Facebook
[01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:59.430]  the prize packages
[01:32:59.430 --> 01:33:00.430]  there won't be
[01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:02.430]  there will be individual prizes
[01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:04.430]  the prizes that are on Facebook are only there on Facebook
[01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:06.430]  the prizes that are on Instagram are only available on Instagram
[01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.430]  so that people that are on different social medias
[01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:10.430]  have options to get in on this
[01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:14.430]  I'll post pictures on whichever site I'm posting it on
[01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:16.430]  what you have to do
[01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:18.430]  is follow
[01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:20.430]  on Instagram you have to follow
[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:22.430]  where is it? you have to follow irigenetics
[01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.430]  you have to follow hygro pueblo
[01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:27.430]  and you have to follow garden of whedon on Instagram
[01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:29.430]  if you want to be in the Instagram contest
[01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:30.430]  you have to follow those people
[01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:32.430]  then you have to comment on a photo
[01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.430]  of the prize package that you want
[01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:35.430]  because I don't want you
[01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:36.430]  if you want a t-shirt
[01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.430]  don't like comment on the nutrient packages
[01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:40.430]  because there are nutrient packages
[01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:42.430]  I want those to go to people that are going to grow
[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.430]  if you want a nutrient package comment on that
[01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:46.430]  if you want a t-shirt comment on that
[01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:48.430]  if you want this sweet ass pendant that Maddie and Spence brought
[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.430]  comment on that
[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:52.430]  so that we can give these prizes to people that want them
[01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:54.430]  comment on the prize that you want using
[01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.430]  hashtag grow from your heart giveaway
[01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.430]  on Instagram
[01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:00.430]  and then comment on that picture
[01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:03.430]  and tell me why you think you should win that prize
[01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.430]  so it's pretty easy
[01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:06.430]  you have three things to do
[01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:07.430]  three people
[01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:09.430]  you have to comment using a hashtag

[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:31.430]  I'll probably delete both of your comments at that point
[01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:33.430]  I'm just trying to keep it fair
[01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:34.430]  I just don't want a bunch of people
[01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:36.430]  spamming the shit out of my stuff
[01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:37.430]  follow the rules

[01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:41.430]  I'm going to try to be as fair as possible
[01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:43.430]  but I do have the right to change the rules
[01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:45.430]  if I feel like you cheated or you're being a douche
[01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:46.430]  I can just cock block you
[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:47.430]  that's my thing

[01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:53.430]  I would pretty much kill for
[01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:55.430]  Jesse and High Grow killed it
[01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:56.430]  when they showed up with
[01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:57.430]  they brought four killer bags

[01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:08.430]  Highly Educated T-shirt
[01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:10.430]  it's a size extra large
[01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:11.430]  and there is one
[01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:13.430]  IRI Genetics sticker pack in there
[01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:15.430]  which is a license plate sticker

[01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:31.430]  because I didn't put that part on the start
[01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:35.430]  so there will be four IRI Genetics T-shirts and sticker packs available
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:37.430]  there's a variety of sizes

[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:07.430]  I'm not shipping this stuff out of America
[01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:09.430]  you got to be in the United States of America
[01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.430]  if you win these prizes
[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.430]  and you want to pay for the shipping
[01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:15.430]  and you're in France or wherever else

[01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:25.430]  even if it goes to Denver
[01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.430]  that's coming out of my pocket

[01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:55.430]  I think it's a honeycomb
[01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:57.430]  it's made by the real ghost cat
[01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:59.430]  glass artist

[01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:03.430]  and they looked at me like I was a dick and told me I had to give it away
[01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:05.430]  so you guys are lucky

[01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:53.430]  so if you're in your grow room, the green light won't bug your plants
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:55.430]  yeah, those have been
[01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:57.430]  a favorite around the people

[01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:37.430]  I don't think that Bronco
[01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:39.430]  logo is used with proper licensing
[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:41.430]  it's a House and Garden T-shirt
[01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.430]  okay, there's that shirt in there
[01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:45.430]  and then there's probably stickers
[01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:47.430]  and there's gonna be other random stuff in that one
[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:49.430]  and then there's our big super number one bonus prize pack

[01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:01.430]  yeah, all you need now is a good pack of seeds
[01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:03.430]  and some soil and a good light
[01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:05.430]  and you'll be crushing it
[01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:07.430]  decent good living soil and shit, yeah
[01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:09.430]  yeah
[01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:11.430]  if you do it right
[01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:13.430]  that'll put you through the first one
[01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:15.430]  that'll teach you, damn, whatever I did that time
[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:17.430]  I'd do it again

[01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:21.430]  and I will use it on something really soon
[01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:23.430]  I've got so many projects coming up
[01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.430]  that I've started another perpetual cycle
[01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:27.430]  instead of doing large rooms all at once
[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:29.430]  I've got a perpetual
[01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.430]  and that gives me more options to run different newts
[01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.430]  so I really like the perpetual better
[01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:35.430]  it just keeps me going
[01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:37.430]  yeah, keeps me
[01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:39.430]  I don't know, it seems like I get stagnant
[01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:41.430]  when I just have a long grow
[01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:43.430]  alright, so guys, get in on these prize packages
[01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:45.430]  here are the rules again
[01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:47.430]  I'm going to take pictures of every prize package
[01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:49.430]  and I will try to show everything that's in the package
[01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:51.430]  in a nice little pile
[01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:53.430]  it's going to take me a minute to get all these up
[01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:55.430]  I will post the pictures to Facebook
[01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:57.430]  I will post some of the pictures to Instagram
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:59.430]  what you've got to do is go and follow
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:01.430]  oh yeah, I didn't say who you had to follow on Facebook
[01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.430]  you have to follow the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:05.430]  you have to follow Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies

[01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:09.430]  and then it's the same thing

[01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:13.430]  and you have to tell me why you should win the prizes
[01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:15.430]  so I will post the pictures
[01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:17.430]  on the at Iry Genetics
[01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:19.430]  on Instagram
[01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.430]  and the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:23.430]  on Facebook is where you'll find these pictures
[01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:25.430]  alright, I said that right, right everyone?

[01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:29.430]  I'm just making sure I'm not fucking anything up
[01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.430]  I just want everybody to be on the same page as me
[01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:33.430]  because my notes are really scattered on this page
[01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:35.430]  and I would imagine all this information will be in the post with the picture
[01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.430]  yeah, yeah, I'll put the rules there too
[01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:39.430]  and check the sizes for the shirts folks, we made sure to get a selection
[01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:41.430]  that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about
[01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:43.430]  so check the photo that you're looking at
[01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:45.430]  don't comment on the extra small shirt
[01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:47.430]  when you want the extra large shirt
[01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:49.430]  the extra medium
[01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:51.430]  the extra shmedium
[01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:53.430]  shmedium, tall and skinny
[01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:55.430]  yeah
[01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:57.430]  dude you look funny in a shmedium
[01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:59.430]  that'd be like a little mini halter top on you
[01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:01.430]  the smits is like 6'4, 6'5
[01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:03.430]  it's the curse of the tall guy
[01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.430]  you're also the skinny guy
[01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:07.430]  so you're doubly bad
[01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:09.430]  yep, yep
[01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.430]  I remember one time I went to, what was it, Big and Tall
[01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:13.430]  one of those, thinking I could get some just regular tall
[01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:15.430]  but no, you gotta be like
[01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:17.430]  size 40 and tall
[01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:19.430]  at the same time, it's like Jesus
[01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:21.430]  you can fit in one pant leg
[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:23.430]  it's big and, not big comma
[01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:25.430]  yeah, so it should be
[01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:27.430]  I forgot to do a shout out to Greenworks
[01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:29.430]  big shout out to Greenworks, they changed the game this year a little bit for a few people
[01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:31.430]  yeah, shout out to Greenworks
[01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:33.430]  I got
[01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:35.430]  indoor, outdoor
[01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:37.430]  tree trunks growing inside
[01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:39.430]  it's ridiculous
[01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:41.430]  check out Spence's Instagram, make sure you do
[01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:43.430]  if you're trying to win some prizes, you're gonna have to like some stuff on Spence's Instagram
[01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.430]  if you're listening to the show, go through there and check it out
[01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:47.430]  these follows, if you aren't already
[01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:49.430]  you will enjoy
[01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:51.430]  listen to episode 50
[01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:53.430]  I think that needs to be a rule
[01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:55.430]  it's not applicable to, you know, at this moment
[01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:57.430]  but once it's on social media
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:59.430]  they're definitely
[01:41:59.430 --> 01:42:01.430]  if they want to know all the rules, they probably listen to number 50
[01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:03.430]  yeah, please, just listen to the podcast guys
[01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.430]  tell your friends, we're getting
[01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:07.430]  we're definitely hitting 4,000 listens on almost every episode
[01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:09.430]  which is pretty cool, the better episodes
[01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:11.430]  get 6,000, the standouts
[01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:13.430]  are getting 5,000 listens
[01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:15.430]  there are some that are still like, the episodes with just me
[01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:17.430]  nobody listens
[01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:19.430]  they listen to about, and I can see on the website
[01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:21.430]  if you listen like for 40 minutes of the episode
[01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:23.430]  or 40% of the episode, it shows me how far
[01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:25.430]  you drop out, and people just get tired
[01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:27.430]  of me rambling by myself
[01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.430]  but tell your friends about the show
[01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:31.430]  if all 5,000 of my listeners told one per
[01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:33.430]  told two people about the show, because one person's gonna
[01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:35.430]  ignore you, and one person might listen
[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:37.430]  that'll probably get me at least another 1,000 listeners
[01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:39.430]  podcasting is still kind of new
[01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:41.430]  it's catching on very quickly
[01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:43.430]  but you tell people
[01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:45.430]  hey man, do you listen to podcasts?
[01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.430]  what's a podcast?
[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:49.430]  or they're like, yeah I do man, what shows are you jamming?
[01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:51.430]  they either know or they don't
[01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:53.430]  so if you tell people, when more people listen
[01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:55.430]  it moves my show up in the ranks in Stitcher
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:57.430]  and in iTunes, and then that shows, it makes it
[01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:59.430]  available to more people, they just see it, and then more people
[01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:01.430]  grow better cannabis, and that's my goal
[01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:03.430]  just more betta, mo' betta weed
[01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:05.430]  all over the world
[01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:07.430]  tell your dealer to listen to the show
[01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:09.430]  yeah, tell whoever's responsible for growing your cannabis
[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:11.430]  to listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:13.430]  and maybe we can get you some better weed
[01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:15.430]  no mids
[01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:17.430]  I tell people all the time
[01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:19.430]  all the time about it
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:21.430]  and we have kind of gotten way off topic on the past few
[01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:23.430]  episodes, because we had Christmas and New Years
[01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.430]  and then I was sick as shit, and these guys came over
[01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:27.430]  and did a rescue episode for me
[01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:29.430]  I don't know if that's even out yet
[01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:31.430]  no, that hasn't been posted as of this time
[01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:33.430]  so I don't know how many listens that got, but it was a great episode
[01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:35.430]  it was funny, the last episode
[01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:37.430]  stoners that are ahead of schedule
[01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:39.430]  yeah
[01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:41.430]  but we are going to get back onto the track
[01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:43.430]  of doing those great episodes, where there's a lot of grow lessons
[01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.430]  and a lot of great guests, you guys are going to learn more shit
[01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:47.430]  it's not just going to be my high ass rambling
[01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.430]  I've actually got
[01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:51.430]  the next like 10 episodes kind of outlined
[01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:53.430]  I know what the topics are going to be
[01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:55.430]  I could scroll through my phone and read off points, but I'm not going to do it
[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:57.430]  learning is what 2015 is all about
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:01.430]  remember that Adam said that, that was not my motto at all
[01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:05.430]  so, y'all going to learn from Adam
[01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.430]  yeah, no, not from me
[01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:09.430]  44
[01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:11.430]  get in on those contests guys
[01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:13.430]  man
[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:15.430]  I could, I would, but
[01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:17.430]  it's one of the smaller prizes, but it's so dope
[01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:19.430]  is that for me Miss Maddie?
[01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:21.430]  Miss Maddie just scooped me up
[01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:23.430]  what screen did you just give me?
[01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:25.430]  hey
[01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:27.430]  you are
[01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:29.430]  close to that mic
[01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.430]  alright, somebody's got to talk while I take a dab
[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:33.430]  yeah, go for it Adam
[01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:35.430]  you always have a good start
[01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:37.430]  well, we learned today
[01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:39.430]  that getting hit in the face with the ball
[01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.430]  pisses people off
[01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:45.430]  shout out to Fish, you know
[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:47.430]  he's doing it
[01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:49.430]  you'll survive buddy
[01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:51.430]  even if it's a total accident
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:53.430]  he really wanted to come, you know, tonight
[01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:55.430]  but he, I'm sorry bro
[01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.430]  the table is really full
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:59.430]  it's crowded, there's, yeah
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:01.430]  seats taken
[01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:03.430]  it's not us being a dick, there's literally, you'd have to
[01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:05.430]  Mike and Jesse are kind of cuddling
[01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:07.430]  Mike and Jesse are pretty damn close to each other
[01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:09.430]  just to make room for
[01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:11.430]  I don't have any more microphones
[01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:15.430]  the third time I hit him in the face with the ball
[01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:17.430]  was totally an accident
[01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:19.430]  it was clearly an accident
[01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:21.430]  it was clearly the straw that
[01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:23.430]  that throw me
[01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:25.430]  but I think taking out of that job site
[01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:27.430]  as fast as you can
[01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:29.430]  with all wheels spinning
[01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:31.430]  towards that very very thin
[01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:33.430]  steel frame gate is just gonna be
[01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:35.430]  something we all do at least twice
[01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:37.430]  I've done it several times
[01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:39.430]  sounds like you guys have fun at work
[01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.430]  we do
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:43.430]  zero fun is allowed at work
[01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:45.430]  looks like you're breaking rules
[01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:47.430]  when a bunch of males of the same age
[01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:49.430]  are left to just stand around
[01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:51.430]  for 15-20 minutes somewhere
[01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:53.430]  yeah, bizarre shit happens
[01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:55.430]  that dab just made my face
[01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:57.430]  today it was t-ball that do weird shit
[01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:59.430]  yeah, like made my eyes get
[01:45:59.430 --> 01:46:01.430]  injuries and property damage
[01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:03.430]  yeah, sorry
[01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:05.430]  softball
[01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:07.430]  that was the
[01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:09.430]  that was the kind of
[01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:11.430]  fun of today, you know
[01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:13.430]  I've been made fun of a couple times but I can't even remember
[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:15.430]  who, you? yeah, they make fun of you at work?
[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:17.430]  it's funny
[01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:19.430]  these guys didn't work together
[01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:21.430]  until recently, I think it's partly my fault
[01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:23.430]  that these guys all kind of built a construction company
[01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:25.430]  together on accident
[01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:27.430]  and it's fun to see all my bros just hanging out
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:29.430]  talking about what they did
[01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:31.430]  because before they were all off doing their own separate shit
[01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:33.430]  and now they all have a good story together
[01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:35.430]  now we all mingle pretty much
[01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:37.430]  it makes for an interesting conversation sometimes
[01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.430]  right
[01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:41.430]  so Adam said that 2015 is the year of learning
[01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:43.430]  does anybody else have something that 2015
[01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:45.430]  is for them? the year of what?
[01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:47.430]  um
[01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:49.430]  cashing in, hopefully
[01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:51.430]  I knew that answer
[01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:53.430]  I'd like some of my really hard work
[01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:55.430]  to pay off and it will
[01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:57.430]  it will, fo' sho'
[01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:59.430]  right, I was thinking the 2014
[01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.430]  is the year of like getting the construction
[01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:03.430]  and the foundation in 2015
[01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:05.430]  is actually seeing some shit
[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:07.430]  succeed and get finished
[01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:09.430]  sounds nice, I finally got hired on
[01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:11.430]  at a large facility so I've got over
[01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:13.430]  200 lights to work with now
[01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:15.430]  that's kind of what my year is going to be about
[01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:17.430]  you're going to have fun with that buddy
[01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.430]  blowing it up bro, blowing it up
[01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:21.430]  get more shirts made, get them on the shelves at the spot
[01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:23.430]  get more hoodies made, get them on the shelves at the spot
[01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:25.430]  some hats
[01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:27.430]  dude I'm glad you said it because Robert if you're listening to this episode
[01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:29.430]  bro, some hats are necessary
[01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:31.430]  we need spot hats and we need
[01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:33.430]  Irie Genetics grass roots hats
[01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:35.430]  I will prepay for my hat

[01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:43.430]  shout out to Hunt
[01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:45.430]  me and Gatsby
[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:47.430]  have relayed messages
[01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:49.430]  five or six times

[01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:53.430]  I've never said that

[01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:03.430]  we'll protect you
[01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.430]  Hunt can take care of himself
[01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:07.430]  he ain't worried about shit
[01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:09.430]  it ain't that bad
[01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:11.430]  it is a dangerous city in Colorado
[01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:15.430]  isn't that funny though
[01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:17.430]  I live here on my hands everyday
[01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:19.430]  I haven't seen a damn bit of it
[01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:21.430]  I actually kind of love this place
[01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:23.430]  people are like why do you still live there
[01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:25.430]  I didn't grow up here but I became who I am
[01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:27.430]  I feel like I kind of owe it to this town
[01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:29.430]  to stay here and be who I am
[01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:31.430]  and support the movement here
[01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:33.430]  how many times have we defended it in Denver
[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:35.430]  and then we beat the shit out of the people
[01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:37.430]  that were talking shit about Pribal
[01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.430]  we fucking stabbed them with switchblades
[01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:41.430]  took all their money
[01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:43.430]  and their Nikes
[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:45.430]  one of the least violent people I know
[01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:49.430]  we've gone almost 50 minutes
[01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:51.430]  we should put another 10 minutes into this show
[01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:53.430]  anybody got anything smart ass or great to say
[01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:55.430]  what are some of your favorite moments
[01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:57.430]  that you've had on this podcast so far
[01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:59.430]  remember that night we sat here
[01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:01.430]  you sat across the table from me
[01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:03.430]  we tried to do a show for like 3 hours
[01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:05.430]  I don't know if it was the dabs
[01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:07.430]  or if it was just the unfocusedness of the group
[01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:11.430]  we had somebody pop in
[01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:15.430]  in the middle of the podcast
[01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:17.430]  he just walks up in the room
[01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:19.430]  starts yelling and screaming
[01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:21.430]  it was weird
[01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:23.430]  it didn't really happen but it kind of really did happen
[01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:25.430]  that was definitely a funny moment
[01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:27.430]  I had a recording error
[01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:29.430]  where I didn't delete one of the pre-recorded tracks
[01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:31.430]  from another recording session
[01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:33.430]  and when it came around to that
[01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:35.430]  that recording dropped in while we were talking
[01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:37.430]  it was perfect
[01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:39.430]  the guy goes, hey it's me man, what's going on
[01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.430]  and just starts talking
[01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:43.430]  but you're not even in the room
[01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:45.430]  how the hell did you just do that
[01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:47.430]  I thought Jeff was a ventriloquist at that point in time
[01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:49.430]  and I was like wow
[01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:51.430]  3am, I think I need to go home man
[01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:53.430]  that's like some 4 track shit
[01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:55.430]  a moment that I really really remember
[01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:57.430]  is when I ate the 350 mg edible on the podcast
[01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:59.430]  I remember
[01:51:59.430 --> 01:52:01.430]  I don't remember the whole
[01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:03.430]  hour show
[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:05.430]  I sat here holding onto my chair
[01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:07.430]  just tapping my feet as hard as I could
[01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:09.430]  woo I'm flying right now
[01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:11.430]  those things
[01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:13.430]  you do not want to come to Colorado and eat
[01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:15.430]  maybe that's what Ralphie ate
[01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:17.430]  maybe brownie
[01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:19.430]  but that's 350 mg of sit the fuck down
[01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:21.430]  read the damn label
[01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:23.430]  if you guys come to Colorado and eat edibles
[01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:25.430]  be careful, please
[01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:27.430]  luckily that's a medical only
[01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:29.430]  I think they can only sell 100 gram edibles at the rec site now
[01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:31.430]  but I mean, you know what incredibles are
[01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:33.430]  yeah they're 100
[01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:35.430]  you can buy like 7 of them
[01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:37.430]  it's still greened out
[01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:39.430]  70 of them I don't remember
[01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:41.430]  like it's
[01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:43.430]  read the fucking label
[01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:45.430]  that was the big lesson
[01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:47.430]  of 2014
[01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:49.430]  what happens if you legalize weed
[01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.430]  oh as it turns out people don't read labels
[01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:53.430]  for fucking anything ever
[01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:55.430]  people that don't even take pot
[01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:57.430]  they don't even smoke
[01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:59.430]  do y'all remember the chips that gave you anal leakage
[01:52:59.430 --> 01:53:01.430]  like they were looking for fat free and it made your asshole drip
[01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:03.430]  that had to be on the front of the bag
[01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:05.430]  and they still sold everywhere
[01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:07.430]  and it's because people don't read labels
[01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:09.430]  and with edibles
[01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:11.430]  that leaves you to
[01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:13.430]  hugging a pair of weird jeans in a hotel room
[01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:15.430]  and then writing about it for the New York Times
[01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:17.430]  or Ralphie May trying not to shit himself on stage
[01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:19.430]  you know the meme
[01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:21.430]  with the little black kid that always says
[01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:23.430]  you mean to tell me that blah blah blah
[01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:25.430]  but you mean to tell me there was some
[01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:27.430]  fucking chips that caused anal leakage
[01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:29.430]  and people were still buying it
[01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:31.430]  I forgot that y'all were probably on
[01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:33.430]  fish tour when this hit the shelves
[01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:35.430]  because those timelines line up
[01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:37.430]  but O'Lestra I think was the special oil
[01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:39.430]  they found a special oil and you could eat
[01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:41.430]  chips that you didn't get any calories from
[01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:43.430]  the side effect was
[01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:45.430]  your butt was leaking
[01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:47.430]  all that fat your body didn't absorb
[01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:49.430]  was dripping out your ass
[01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.430]  I'll pass, I will pass
[01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:53.430]  America was all about it
[01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:55.430]  I don't need a snack I have to eat on the toilet
[01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:57.430]  Jesse's a fellow
[01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.430]  to eat anything at the gas station kid
[01:53:59.430 --> 01:54:01.430]  you know what the fuck's up
[01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:03.430]  I remember making fun of my cousin for eating those
[01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:05.430]  I remember reading the package
[01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:07.430]  it's right on the front of the bag
[01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:09.430]  may cause anal leakage
[01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:11.430]  and they still sold all over the country
[01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:13.430]  this is definitely a record time for the word anal
[01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:15.430]  being sold on the front of the bag
[01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:17.430]  350 milligrams
[01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:19.430]  people just don't even see it
[01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:21.430]  they think 350 milligrams
[01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:23.430]  that seems like a lot for a fun sized snickers
[01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:25.430]  is edible
[01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:27.430]  they chew that shit back and 20 minutes later they think they're in space
[01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:29.430]  they're really just sitting
[01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:31.430]  in the hot tub of their hotel room
[01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:33.430]  just splashing in 3 inches of water
[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:35.430]  35 to 45 minutes isn't enough time
[01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:37.430]  seriously give it 2 or 3 hours
[01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:39.430]  give it some time
[01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:41.430]  it takes a long time to kick it
[01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:43.430]  it's gotta be broken down and processed into your blood
[01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:45.430]  and it takes a while
[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:47.430]  bad Ralphie
[01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:49.430]  every person is different
[01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:51.430]  hey Spencer are you going to enter any contests in 2015?
[01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:53.430]  um
[01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:55.430]  hopefully
[01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:57.430]  I'd like to
[01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:59.430]  travel to Oregon
[01:54:59.430 --> 01:55:01.430]  and Seattle
[01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:03.430]  again this year and go enter up there
[01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:05.430]  maybe California
[01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:07.430]  high times cannabis cops?
[01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:09.430]  hopefully
[01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:11.430]  maybe
[01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:13.430]  what next
[01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:15.430]  next November
[01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:17.430]  maybe
[01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:19.430]  the best thing about going to cups
[01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:21.430]  is it's like vacation
[01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:23.430]  but there's weed
[01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:25.430]  yeah
[01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:27.430]  you don't have to worry about trying to find weed
[01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:29.430]  because you're going to a weed event
[01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:31.430]  so it's there
[01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:33.430]  you guys got your Denver Cannabis Cup tickets yet?
[01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:35.430]  don't know what we're doing yet
[01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:37.430]  we're going to buy tickets or go through the vending route
[01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.430]  oh yeah
[01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:41.430]  I got my 3 day pass
[01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:43.430]  I'm just working on booking a hotel room
[01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:45.430]  I've actually got a ticket to see Doug Benson
[01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:47.430]  on 420 at 9 o'clock
[01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:49.430]  it's just me
[01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:51.430]  I just roll solo and do the backpack thing
[01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:53.430]  it's so much easier
[01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:55.430]  get in the car and leave when I want
[01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:57.430]  go where I want
[01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:59.430]  it's just going to be me doing the backpack and the car
[01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:01.430]  yeah
[01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:03.430]  as soon as I get extra money
[01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:05.430]  I like going
[01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:07.430]  I like going with the crew
[01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:09.430]  especially me when I'm trying to talk to people
[01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:11.430]  it's kind of hard having
[01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:13.430]  15 people
[01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:15.430]  when you're trying to all go
[01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:17.430]  you get tired of hanging out with me at the Cannabis Cup
[01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:19.430]  I'm not even trying to be egotistical
[01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:21.430]  but people walk up and want to talk to me
[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:23.430]  they know who I am
[01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:25.430]  so if you're hanging out with me you're just hanging out by yourself
[01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:27.430]  so I roll solo
[01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:29.430]  it's easy
[01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:31.430]  you can do a lot of shit by yourself
[01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:33.430]  Mike do you want to do this?
[01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:35.430]  are you hungry Mike?
[01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:37.430]  these events are so crowded and so well attended
[01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:39.430]  I'm just trying to picture one of you walking with like 15
[01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:41.430]  I'm going to call them ducklings
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:43.430]  it's not intended as insulting as that sounds I guess
[01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:45.430]  trying to walk down the aisle like that
[01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:47.430]  you got to lose all your ducklings
[01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:49.430]  you end up at the end of the road going
[01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:51.430]  well fuck them I got business to do
[01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:53.430]  yeah pretty much
[01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:55.430]  that's the big thing for me this year is business
[01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:57.430]  I'm trying to take care of business
[01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:59.430]  no more playing games and being nice
[01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:01.430]  none of that
[01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:03.430]  I'm trying to come out and take some cake
[01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:05.430]  there you go
[01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:07.430]  I'll be trying to talk to somebody
[01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.430]  hanging out with Mila and the people with me don't even know who Mila is
[01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:11.430]  you have no clue who she is
[01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.430]  you know who that was?
[01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:15.430]  no I'm fucking bored
[01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:17.430]  you should have got in on that conversation
[01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.430]  you should have said hello
[01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:21.430]  you should have got your picture taken
[01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:23.430]  you should have given her a hug
[01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:25.430]  give her some oil or something
[01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:27.430]  yeah yeah
[01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:29.430]  I think that yeah there's something
[01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:31.430]  I should be paying attention to
[01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:33.430]  and even if I don't understand right now it'll probably be explained later
[01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:35.430]  with this guy even
[01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:37.430]  lunch can be a mild adventure
[01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:39.430]  where famous people just appear
[01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:41.430]  you just got to accept it
[01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:43.430]  it's bizarre
[01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:45.430]  you just got to know how to put yourself in the position
[01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:47.430]  and line yourself up to meet the people you want to meet
[01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:49.430]  without being creepy and realize they're just fucking people too
[01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:51.430]  and if you open with the right lines
[01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:53.430]  they're just humans too and they realize that you're not a stalker
[01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:55.430]  and they want to talk to you
[01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:57.430]  I'm a nice dude I'm nobody perfect
[01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:59.430]  and I'm sure I'm not everybody's cup of tea
[01:57:59.430 --> 01:58:01.430]  but I'm a nice dude that
[01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:03.430]  tells the truth most of the time
[01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:05.430]  I felt giddy when DNA genetics walked up to me
[01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:07.430]  and shook my hand because they recognized me
[01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:09.430]  and my logo from Instagram
[01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:11.430]  they're like hey I know who you are man
[01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:13.430]  and they said what's up to me and gave me props for my work
[01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:15.430]  that kind of put a smile on my face
[01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:17.430]  I got a hot nail somebody talk while I dab
[01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:19.430]  I mean you got a great email set up for him
[01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:21.430]  from him you know
[01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:23.430]  and shout out for that
[01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:25.430]  we use it every day we used it right before the show
[01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:27.430]  oh just shout out to the g-nail
[01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:29.430]  I thought that earlier and then I forgot it again
[01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:31.430]  oh yeah I'm sorry
[01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:33.430]  shout out to the a-o-g
[01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:35.430]  but yeah the g-nail is a beautiful invention
[01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:37.430]  these dabs are available that are on the table
[01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:39.430]  anybody can dab out of that
[01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:41.430]  I'm not trying to be stache but
[01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:43.430]  yeah here go for it
[01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:45.430]  Matti will start helping out too
[01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:47.430]  big shout out to dabs
[01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:49.430]  yeah big shout out to dabs
[01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:51.430]  a lot of those early podcasts
[01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:53.430]  might not have been put together at 3am
[01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:55.430]  yeah don't tell everybody
[01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:57.430]  those happen at like sunrise and shit
[01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.430]  half asleep trying to do a podcast
[01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:01.430]  no we weren't half asleep
[01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:03.430]  I'm so much more comfortable
[01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:05.430]  on a mic now I just swing the mic in front of me
[01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:07.430]  I don't even edit the shows anymore
[01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:09.430]  I'm just like what's up podcast time
[01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:11.430]  I feel better putting some of me into the show
[01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:13.430]  instead of just being all information
[01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:15.430]  I feel like I've made a lot of friends now
[01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:17.430]  and from listening to
[01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:19.430]  I listened to the Nerdist and I listened to Doug Benson
[01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:21.430]  and now when I see those guys
[01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:23.430]  I saw Nerdist, Chris Hardwick at Red Rocks
[01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:25.430]  and it was like watching one of my friends achieve a goal
[01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:27.430]  so I feel like maybe my
[01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:29.430]  listeners feel like I'm one of their buddies
[01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:31.430]  especially the people that interact with me on Twitter
[01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.430]  I know I'm their friend
[01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:35.430]  like if I met Mr. Omnio, he lives in the UK
[01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:37.430]  if he showed up
[01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:39.430]  he'd bring the doorbell, he'd come in and take dabs
[01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:41.430]  and hang out, I'd make a cup of yerba mate
[01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:43.430]  and we'd chill out and he'd be my bro
[01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:45.430]  and just because I have a podcast
[01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:47.430]  so that guy's my friend now from that
[01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:49.430]  Fred Garvin would probably show up and come take dabs
[01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:51.430]  we just killed Mike with the dab
[01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:53.430]  there he goes, shout out to Mike
[01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:55.430]  I'd really like for you to get
[01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:57.430]  uh
[01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:59.430]  Addison
[01:59:59.430 --> 02:00:01.430]  who was on show number two
[02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:03.430]  Addison DeMora
[02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:05.430]  get him back
[02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:07.430]  you've been asking and asking and asking
[02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:09.430]  big shout out to Addison, I should have given a shout out to that guy
[02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:11.430]  he's been on the show, Addison, Big D
[02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:13.430]  Hunt, all the Denver crew, Nick Atee
[02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:15.430]  shout out, shout out
[02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:17.430]  oh don't do that, that would be the most horrific thing ever
[02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:19.430]  I know he's been beating up
[02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:21.430]  the microphone, Matty's about to blast
[02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:23.430]  Spence's natty beard slash
[02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:25.430]  dreadlock mess, torch to the dome
[02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:27.430]  torch to the dome
[02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:29.430]  uh, somebody should
[02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:31.430]  hold on, I'm gonna yell you guys so it'd be cool
[02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:33.430]  hey Mike, are you alive?
[02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:35.430]  Mike is alive, you guys
[02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:37.430]  we did not kill him, very borderline
[02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.430]  but he made it
[02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:41.430]  alright, does anybody else have anything to say?
[02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:43.430]  we're down to two minutes, or we're down to a minute
[02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:45.430]  try to keep this about an hour
[02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.430]  do your stuff
[02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:49.430]  alive and well, people
[02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:51.430]  nice, we did not kill Mike
[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:53.430]  I've said it a couple times, but I sincerely want to thank all you guys
[02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:55.430]  for coming to the show
[02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:57.430]  you guys are, Adam's made jokes about A team and B team
[02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:59.430]  and shit, but this is my crew right here
[02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:01.430]  and I know if something went wrong in my life
[02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:03.430]  this would be the first five people I could call
[02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:05.430]  to help me out
[02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:07.430]  I really appreciate everything you guys
[02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:09.430]  taught me this year
[02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:11.430]  and all together throughout the times that I've known you
[02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:13.430]  especially Jeff, especially you
[02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:15.430]  taught me a lot since I moved here from North Carolina
[02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:17.430]  now I feel like I'm from Colorado
[02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:19.430]  yeah, welcome home
[02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:21.430]  good, thank you
[02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:23.430]  I didn't realize I taught you so much
[02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:25.430]  I didn't realize you absorbed so much of what I taught you
[02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:27.430]  I learned from you guys too
[02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:29.430]  it's not just me teaching you guys
[02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:31.430]  I come and parrot a lot of shit that Spence says
[02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:33.430]  just in my own language, you know what I mean?
[02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:35.430]  I learn shit from you guys every day
[02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:37.430]  so thank you guys too, thanks for having me
[02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:39.430]  no problem
[02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:41.430]  I'm so proud of you guys
[02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:43.430]  and Spence
[02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:45.430]  and Sean, and even Clint
[02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:47.430]  and Mike, Mike's taught me to grow shit on accident
[02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:49.430]  just refreshing your mind
[02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:51.430]  not everything about growing
[02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:53.430]  is about growing, there's simple shit in your grow room
[02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:55.430]  that Mike may go
[02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:57.430]  why is that turned that way? if you turn that way
[02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:59.430]  you'd get better air flow
[02:01:59.430 --> 02:02:01.430]  I'm just giving random examples
[02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:03.430]  there's physics and shit to be done in the grow room
[02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:05.430]  shout out to Tony also, sorry I skipped that one
[02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:07.430]  he keeps the website going
[02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:09.430]  he's one of the, when I said physics
[02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:11.430]  I thought of Tony right away
[02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:13.430]  he knows about air flow and a lot of that shit
[02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:15.430]  even if your friends aren't the best growers
[02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:17.430]  you can learn accidentally about HVAC, you can learn plumbing
[02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:19.430]  all that shit comes in handy
[02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:21.430]  so don't ever take anybody for granted
[02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:23.430]  shout out to Vaughn
[02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:25.430]  and Scott, they'll never listen to this probably
[02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:27.430]  but they at least deserve the big love
[02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:29.430]  my wife listens to it actually
[02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:31.430]  and Ralph, just while we're listening people
[02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:33.430]  I learned to drywall already this year
[02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:35.430]  you're a learning shit
[02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:37.430]  way to fucking name it
[02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:41.430]  big shout out to Ralph who taught me how to drywall
[02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:43.430]  44's method of learning will get you
[02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:45.430]  far places alright
[02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:47.430]  yo Fish I'm sorry I was dissing you
[02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:49.430]  on the other show bro, I'm sorry man
[02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:51.430]  also shout out to Dreadful J
[02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.430]  I haven't given her a shout out in a while
[02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:55.430]  she listens
[02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:57.430]  shout out for impact resistant glasses
[02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:59.430]  this show should just be called episode 50 mad
[02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:01.430]  shout outs
[02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:03.430]  earlier when you were shouting out
[02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:05.430]  that's kinda what I was going for honestly
[02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:07.430]  your mom called she said take a nap
[02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:09.430]  that's kinda what I was going for
[02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:11.430]  that dude don't know a goddamn thing about Miami
[02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:13.430]  or whatever
[02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:15.430]  I'll try to put some music in the background of that shit
[02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:17.430]  just put that music in there
[02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:19.430]  see if you can find it
[02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:21.430]  I don't know I won't get sued but iTunes will take it down
[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:23.430]  yeah
[02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:25.430]  they've never taken down
[02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:27.430]  you're telling me you can't go down there and make a dubbed version somehow
[02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:29.430]  of every single instrument
[02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:31.430]  back in the day I used to play like Marlon Asher and Popular Reggae
[02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:33.430]  and they never flagged any of my shows
[02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:35.430]  but I only had like 100 listens back then
[02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:37.430]  yeah yeah yeah that shit's funny bro
[02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:39.430]  thanks
[02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:41.430]  boom chicka boom chicka
[02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:43.430]  you mean that song
[02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:45.430]  good job Barney Stinson
[02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:47.430]  alright thanks for listening you guys
[02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:49.430]  I promise the episodes are gonna get better
[02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:51.430]  I promise the guests are gonna stay high caliber
[02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:53.430]  everybody eating the tear is
[02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:55.430]  hi
[02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:57.430]  now he's a smart ass
[02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:59.430]  after that dab he took
[02:03:59.430 --> 02:04:01.430]  everybody that's here is invited back whenever they'd like to be back
[02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:03.430]  I promise I'll have everybody here again
[02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:05.430]  we're gonna do great shows
[02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:07.430]  we need to get some more ladies on the show
[02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:09.430]  it's harder to get ladies on the show
[02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:11.430]  there aren't as many ladies
[02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:13.430]  guys have more shit to talk about cause we're kinda egoists
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:15.430]  you know what I mean
[02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:17.430]  you hang out with a bunch of badass dudes
[02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:19.430]  I've got a squad of guys around me all the time
[02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:21.430]  that's what I'm saying I saw that picture you posted
[02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:23.430]  like all these dudes protect me
[02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:25.430]  hell yeah we all have your back dude
[02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:27.430]  yeah definitely I'm standing in the back there with a big ol' smile
[02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:29.430]  like I got her back forever
[02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:31.430]  that was a merry Christmas picture
[02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.430]  I know there's other growers like in the scene
[02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:35.430]  and instagram and all that stuff but you're the only one here locally
[02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:37.430]  that's at least known
[02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:39.430]  for producing
[02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:41.430]  killer stuff so
[02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:43.430]  ladies that wanna be on the podcast
[02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:45.430]  that have something to contribute about cannabis
[02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:47.430]  if it's your opinion your view
[02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:49.430]  I know very very few female growers
[02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:51.430]  that I have a lot of respect for
[02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:53.430]  but hopefully some will step up
[02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:55.430]  come be on the show if you want
[02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:57.430]  we are in Pueblo Colorado on the south side
[02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:59.430]  all you gotta do is send me an email
[02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:01.430]  you can call me you can instagram you can facebook me
[02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:03.430]  it's growfromyourheart
[02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:05.430]  at hotmail.com I'm on instagram
[02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:07.430]  at ireegenetics
[02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:09.430]  that was a big ol' dab
[02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:11.430]  Spencer just gave me a fat dab
[02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:13.430]  and he got up and left when you did it
[02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:15.430]  he took it off somewhere
[02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:17.430]  the email is in the other room turned on
[02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:19.430]  so that could be where he went
[02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:21.430]  there wasn't any room on the table for the email tonight
[02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:23.430]  with all the gear I had
[02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.430]  coming out of my nose
[02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:27.430]  it's called an angry dragon
[02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:29.430]  isn't it
[02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:31.430]  this is the terminology
[02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:33.430]  alright on that note we're gonna wrap up the show
[02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:35.430]  I love you guys thanks for listening
[02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:37.430]  everybody that came everybody that's listening
[02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:39.430]  everyone that downloaded the show everyone that contributes
[02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:41.430]  hey also a little bit of pandering
[02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:43.430]  I added we added Tony technically added
[02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:45.430]  at the request of myself a donate button
[02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:47.430]  on the ireegenetics website
[02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:49.430]  if you go to ireegenetics.com
[02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:51.430]  find the growfromyourheart podcast tab
[02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:53.430]  there is a donate button at the top
[02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:55.430]  if you feel like this show
[02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:57.430]  was worth a couple of bucks and you want to make
[02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:59.430]  a slight contribution you can make
[02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:01.430]  a donation to the show
[02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:03.430]  I will thank you on the show if you'd like me to
[02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:05.430]  or you can tell me not to say your name
[02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:07.430]  I'm not begging for money
[02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:09.430]  but a couple people said that if I
[02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:11.430]  had the donation button they would throw donations
[02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.430]  in there and why not
[02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:15.430]  take a donation if someone's trying to offer it
[02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:17.430]  you put so much of your time and effort
[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:19.430]  into this you deserve it
[02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:21.430]  you can put it back into the podcast
[02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:23.430]  for necessary equipment
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:25.430]  we can potentially have more giveaways
[02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:27.430]  you can also put it as
[02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:29.430]  anonymous so you don't even
[02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:31.430]  need to know
[02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:33.430]  it's just three bucks that came from nowhere
[02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:35.430]  I learned about something else that I may
[02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:37.430]  try to do in the future
[02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:39.430]  it's called a money bomb is what this guy called it
[02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:41.430]  if you listen to a lot of podcasts you may already know
[02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:43.430]  about it I don't want to tell you too much about it
[02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:45.430]  I haven't paid too much attention to how to do it
[02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:47.430]  but it sounds like a great idea to where it will give
[02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:49.430]  me money to give away to my listeners
[02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:51.430]  and also help fund the podcast a little
[02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:53.430]  and like Matty said I do put some
[02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:55.430]  time into this, everybody here
[02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:57.430]  spent about an hour with me before we even recorded
[02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:59.430]  putting this show together
[02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:01.430]  I was thinking while you were talking what it would
[02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:03.430]  cost to get all of us in a room
[02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:05.430]  save for like a two
[02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:07.430]  hour consultation with the business
[02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:09.430]  and
[02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:11.430]  it's in the thousands
[02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:13.430]  I'm expensive for that kind of thing
[02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:15.430]  to get all of us at the table is up front
[02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:17.430]  and honest as we are with the podcast
[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:19.430]  I'm sitting here thinking about the content
[02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:21.430]  over the last 50 episodes
[02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:23.430]  and if you go back and cherry pick
[02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:25.430]  say like the outdoor
[02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:27.430]  growing lesson episodes
[02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:29.430]  or in the growing and curing and harvesting
[02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:31.430]  episodes
[02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:33.430]  that's
[02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:35.430]  like job training if you pay attention
[02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:37.430]  and take notes
[02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:39.430]  you can fully have a career based on that
[02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:41.430]  information if you put a couple
[02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:43.430]  years of practice into it and do your
[02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:45.430]  independent research that's the foundation
[02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:47.430]  that's like a bachelors degree in weed
[02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:51.430]  not even fucking around a little that's legit
[02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.430]  Jesse's outdoor lessons
[02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:55.430]  this year basically walked me
[02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:57.430]  through my outdoor this year
[02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:59.430]  you know like there was things
[02:07:59.430 --> 02:08:01.430]  got your weed dried and cured
[02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:03.430]  and then Sean came and talked to you about organics
[02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:05.430]  and taught you how to not go buy bottled nutrients
[02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:07.430]  anymore and I mean just yesterday
[02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:09.430]  I mixed up Grokashi
[02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:11.430]  you know what I'm saying like oh oh look out
[02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:13.430]  here for a year of mixing
[02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:15.430]  Grokashi. I want to get an extract
[02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:17.430]  artist on here that will teach us how to make hash
[02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:19.430]  but at the same time that's risky because
[02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:21.430]  we can't teach you how to open blast
[02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:23.430]  because that's not legit and then nobody
[02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:25.430]  wants to give away their clothes
[02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:27.430]  we can sell a whole bunch
[02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:29.430]  maybe we'll get someone to come teach us how to make water hash
[02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:31.430]  we'll get Fred Morris or somebody to come teach
[02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:33.430]  you how to make water hash. That's a very good idea
[02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:35.430]  Fred Morris if you listen to the show hit me up bro
[02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:37.430]  please I want you to come on and teach us how to make
[02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:39.430]  water hash you know
[02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:41.430]  I guess the table there knows quite a bit
[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:43.430]  about water hash as well
[02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:45.430]  he's keeping his head down but you know
[02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:47.430]  he also knows who Fred Morris is
[02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:49.430]  so he knows why I'm saying Fred Morris
[02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:51.430]  I'm not trying to call you out
[02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:53.430]  I'm just saying that you know I've
[02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:55.430]  smoked it and it was very
[02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:57.430]  impressive you know and maybe I haven't had that much
[02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:59.430]  bubble hash but
[02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:01.430]  I do alright
[02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:03.430]  Spence got ADD he had to go charge his phone
[02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:05.430]  Spence was over there digging through the prize packs a minute ago
[02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:07.430]  it's too high man you can't give that many dabs for a podcast
[02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:09.430]  it's just how we roll
[02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:11.430]  all he's thinking about is damn Amy Donuts

[02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:29.430]  yeah they closed at 7 that's what I'm saying it's 9
[02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:31.430]  and they are closed
[02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:33.430]  you meant as they were open

[02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:31.690]  because I just work too much
[02:18:31.690 --> 02:18:33.690]  Jeff's busy too but
[02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:35.690]  you know it's just I'm a

[02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:45.690]  and that would just drive my body insane
[02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:47.690]  yeah we do 12 hour shifts
[02:18:47.690 --> 02:18:49.690]  Monday through Friday
[02:18:49.690 --> 02:18:51.690]  7 to 7 and then
[02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:53.690]  so you're doing AM to PM
[02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:55.690]  and then the next week you do PM to AM
[02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:57.690]  and then back and back and back
[02:18:57.690 --> 02:18:59.690]  you know so you're just constantly trying
[02:18:59.690 --> 02:19:01.690]  to catch up on sleep so I apologize for not
[02:19:01.690 --> 02:19:03.690]  coming and hanging out with you brother
[02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:05.690]  it's understood you're here now and we got to have tons of fun
[02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:07.690]  yeah tons of fun so last night
[02:19:07.690 --> 02:19:09.690]  Clint actually bought me a ticket
[02:19:09.690 --> 02:19:11.690]  to go see Ari Shafir if you don't know Ari
[02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:13.690]  Shafir he's on At Midnight
[02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:15.690]  quite often you got to watch At Midnight
[02:19:15.690 --> 02:19:17.690]  if you're into funny shit he's got a show called
[02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:19.690]  This Is Not Happening on Comedy
[02:19:19.690 --> 02:19:21.690]  Central Thursday nights
[02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:23.690]  he's got a podcast he's got a podcast called
[02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:25.690]  The Skeptic Tank it's great and then he
[02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:27.690]  just put a special out on Comedy Central
[02:19:27.690 --> 02:19:29.690]  yep paid regular paid regular
[02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:31.690]  about his experience
[02:19:31.690 --> 02:19:33.690]  coming up at the comedy store in Los
[02:19:33.690 --> 02:19:35.690]  Angeles where most of our favorite
[02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:37.690]  comedians seem to have gotten their start at least
[02:19:37.690 --> 02:19:39.690]  at least went through there for a time
[02:19:39.690 --> 02:19:41.690]  yeah I really enjoyed
[02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:43.690]  his comedy last night man he tore
[02:19:43.690 --> 02:19:45.690]  it up so I have never seen
[02:19:45.690 --> 02:19:47.690]  or paid attention to Steve Simone
[02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:49.690]  on the way up Clint told me that Steve Simone
[02:19:49.690 --> 02:19:51.690]  was the opening act dude Steve Simone
[02:19:51.690 --> 02:19:53.690]  was amazingly funny he's a mostly
[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.690]  clean comic he didn't I don't think he
[02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:57.690]  ever said fuck he might
[02:19:57.690 --> 02:19:59.690]  have but I mean it was in passing I think
[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.690]  it was something where it was
[02:20:01.690 --> 02:20:03.690]  it was so fun he just he's a
[02:20:03.690 --> 02:20:05.690]  ball of energy and he's still
[02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:07.690]  in sixth or fifth grade
[02:20:07.690 --> 02:20:09.690]  you know what I mean he pulls on his shirt
[02:20:09.690 --> 02:20:11.690]  he's a 35 year old 6th grader
[02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:13.690]  yeah it's great it's kind of cute
[02:20:13.690 --> 02:20:15.690]  it's adorable as a grown man watching him wiggle
[02:20:15.690 --> 02:20:17.690]  around all uncomfortable but comfortable
[02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:19.690]  you know like he's got all that attention
[02:20:19.690 --> 02:20:21.690]  that he wanted but now he's like oh shit I've got
[02:20:21.690 --> 02:20:23.690]  the attention and he starts wiggling
[02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:25.690]  but he tore it up he crushed it was real fun
[02:20:25.690 --> 02:20:27.690]  and then shout out to Chris
[02:20:27.690 --> 02:20:29.690]  Charpentier for hosting that show
[02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:31.690]  too that was great he was hilarious yeah
[02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:33.690]  I like that the openers get that
[02:20:33.690 --> 02:20:35.690]  short little set because then they just do that
[02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:37.690]  light set and then they get out of there
[02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:39.690]  I think that's kind of smooth
[02:20:39.690 --> 02:20:41.690]  it's a good way to show yourself off
[02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:43.690]  Charpentier is a Denver guy so
[02:20:43.690 --> 02:20:45.690]  we're trying to get him to come down to Pueblo
[02:20:45.690 --> 02:20:47.690]  that's sweet we're trying to do stuff down here
[02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:49.690]  too we're trying I'm still
[02:20:49.690 --> 02:20:51.690]  an open mic-er but we put on shows every once in a while
[02:20:51.690 --> 02:20:53.690]  it's just you know we're busy with work so
[02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:55.690]  everybody's trying but
[02:20:55.690 --> 02:20:57.690]  made some new friends last night
[02:20:57.690 --> 02:20:59.690]  it was real fun at the Denver
[02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:01.690]  Comedy Works which is our favorite club

[02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:17.690]  because I was high as shit the whole
[02:21:17.690 --> 02:21:19.690]  day when you're that high and having fun

[02:22:07.690 --> 02:22:09.690]  medicine comedy is my soulful

[02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:15.690]  THC and like
[02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:17.690]  almost 15% CBD
[02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:19.690]  okay so
[02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:21.690]  I'm going to kind of rewind and shout out to Natural
[02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:23.690]  Mystic Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs
[02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:25.690]  that's where we got this high CBD medicine
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:29.690]  Angela is one of my best friends I know a lot about
[02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:31.690]  her and I'm going to try not to talk too much about
[02:27:31.690 --> 02:27:33.690]  her world so if you feel like you need to slow me down and tell me
[02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:35.690]  not to say that or whatever feel free to cut me off
[02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:37.690]  I'm going to try to be completely respectful about this conversation
[02:27:37.690 --> 02:27:39.690]  but it's your health that I'm talking about and it's your private shit
[02:27:39.690 --> 02:27:41.690]  so interrupt me whenever you feel necessary and chime in
[02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:43.690]  when you want
[02:27:43.690 --> 02:27:45.690]  Angela used to dab with me
[02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:47.690]  like a fucking champion dude Angela used to
[02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:49.690]  smoke fat joints she would roll
[02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:51.690]  joints the size of my middle finger
[02:27:51.690 --> 02:27:53.690]  and I've got a big middle finger and her and I
[02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:55.690]  would smoke them just to the dome
[02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:57.690]  and then she'd roll another one and smoke
[02:27:57.690 --> 02:27:59.690]  we'd smoke half of that and then put it out and smoke it later
[02:27:59.690 --> 02:28:01.690]  so she was a heavy
[02:28:01.690 --> 02:28:03.690]  smoker one day she had a
[02:28:03.690 --> 02:28:05.690]  mean headache and somebody did
[02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:07.690]  the hippie pressure point where they
[02:28:07.690 --> 02:28:09.690]  squeeze between your forefinger
[02:28:09.690 --> 02:28:11.690]  and your thumb there's a little spot in there that
[02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:13.690]  all your old hippie friends will tell you if you squeeze that
[02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:15.690]  rub that a little bit your headache will go away
[02:28:15.690 --> 02:28:17.690]  so one of our silly hippie friends
[02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:19.690]  did that and she completely
[02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:21.690]  blacked out
[02:28:21.690 --> 02:28:23.690]  eyes did a little fluttering and she hit the floor
[02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:25.690]  and when she came to she was really
[02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:27.690]  disoriented and kind of groggy
[02:28:27.690 --> 02:28:29.690]  and it's been labeled
[02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:31.690]  a seizure is what anybody any medical
[02:28:31.690 --> 02:28:33.690]  person has called it and so she
[02:28:33.690 --> 02:28:35.690]  went home she got
[02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:37.690]  home from work and what's the first thing you want to do
[02:28:37.690 --> 02:28:39.690]  after that you want to go smoking a joint after you
[02:28:39.690 --> 02:28:41.690]  just had some traumatic shit like that happen to you
[02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:43.690]  and she tried that and
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:45.690]  she told me that she felt
[02:28:45.690 --> 02:28:47.690]  like she was tripping she's like I'm
[02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:49.690]  hallucinating I'm seeing shit and she put a
[02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:51.690]  blanket over her head and laid down
[02:28:51.690 --> 02:28:53.690]  on the couch in the fetal position and wouldn't
[02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:55.690]  talk to me for like an hour
[02:28:55.690 --> 02:28:57.690]  yeah she was hating life and this is
[02:28:57.690 --> 02:28:59.690]  a girl that I've seen take half gram dabs
[02:28:59.690 --> 02:29:01.690]  and laugh at me she used to make fun of Adam
[02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:03.690]  we would smoke and Adam would tap
[02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:05.690]  out and want to go home and she'd be like come on pussy
[02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:07.690]  smoke a joint I smoked like two grams
[02:29:07.690 --> 02:29:09.690]  of wax to myself a day around
[02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:11.690]  about I'm going to push the mic to you just a little closer
[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:13.690]  there you go you're great I'm
[02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:15.690]  just going to do it a little louder so we can hear you she said that she used to
[02:29:15.690 --> 02:29:17.690]  smoke two grams of wax a day by herself
[02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:19.690]  and her and I hanging out together we'd
[02:29:19.690 --> 02:29:21.690]  kill an eighth of hash in a day just
[02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:23.690]  on a normal day just her and I smoking
[02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:25.690]  yeah yeah so
[02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.690]  she went home and smoked one joint
[02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:29.690]  or one dab or whatever and was freaking out
[02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:31.690]  and she thought maybe it's just today
[02:29:31.690 --> 02:29:33.690]  you know she gave it some time and went about her life but she
[02:29:33.690 --> 02:29:35.690]  still had a headache and didn't feel right
[02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:37.690]  so she smoked more weed and every time
[02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:39.690]  she would smoke weed she would just get
[02:29:39.690 --> 02:29:41.690]  ridiculously high it was like hanging out with a high
[02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:43.690]  fifth grader you're like you got to tuck her in
[02:29:43.690 --> 02:29:45.690]  and get her something to eat I'm not talking shit like it's
[02:29:45.690 --> 02:29:47.690]  really what was happening to her she went from a pro
[02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:49.690]  to Clint yeah just
[02:29:49.690 --> 02:29:51.690]  we had to babysit her when she would get high and she'd get
[02:29:51.690 --> 02:29:53.690]  super anxious a lot of anxiety from smoking
[02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:55.690]  weed so we found a few strains
[02:29:55.690 --> 02:29:57.690]  that would work better the platinum og was working
[02:29:57.690 --> 02:29:59.690]  well and the girl scout cookies was getting her
[02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:01.690]  too high but it was the kind
[02:30:01.690 --> 02:30:03.690]  of a more comfortable high for her it seemed like
[02:30:03.690 --> 02:30:05.690]  so she didn't feel really it's
[02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:07.690]  been about a month and she really did not feel good
[02:30:07.690 --> 02:30:09.690]  a few days ago it's been about a week right
[02:30:09.690 --> 02:30:11.690]  yeah and she felt like shit
[02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:13.690]  this only happened a week ago
[02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:15.690]  the part I'm getting into now
[02:30:15.690 --> 02:30:17.690]  this was probably a month or two
[02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:19.690]  ago when the seizure incident happened
[02:30:19.690 --> 02:30:21.690]  longer than that it's been like three
[02:30:21.690 --> 02:30:23.690]  months now okay I'll agree with that
[02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:25.690]  because I like really want to get high
[02:30:25.690 --> 02:30:27.690]  like I used to yeah
[02:30:27.690 --> 02:30:29.690]  yeah like I do it's affecting her
[02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:31.690]  it's kind of it's affecting a lot like
[02:30:31.690 --> 02:30:33.690]  even when I'm not smoking
[02:30:33.690 --> 02:30:35.690]  my anxiety is just super
[02:30:35.690 --> 02:30:37.690]  shitty yeah and
[02:30:37.690 --> 02:30:39.690]  not being able to she obviously
[02:30:39.690 --> 02:30:41.690]  you kind of Jones for some smoke because
[02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:43.690]  it's a ritualistic it's not just wanting to get high
[02:30:43.690 --> 02:30:45.690]  her and I used to pass a joint back and forth and lay
[02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:47.690]  around and smoke a joint together it was like
[02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:49.690]  just feel good feels good to get stoned and smoke
[02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:51.690]  and like
[02:30:51.690 --> 02:30:53.690]  being sick and not being able to smoke the
[02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:55.690]  medicine that she relied on it's
[02:30:55.690 --> 02:30:57.690]  driving her crazy I can fucking see it it's making
[02:30:57.690 --> 02:30:59.690]  her kind of grouchy so
[02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:01.690]  we going we call my friend Joey
[02:31:01.690 --> 02:31:03.690]  at natural mystic cannabis caregivers about a week ago
[02:31:03.690 --> 02:31:05.690]  and I'm like hey bro do you have any high CBD and
[02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:07.690]  he said I sure do come on up to the shop we'll get you
[02:31:07.690 --> 02:31:09.690]  set up I wish I could remember the
[02:31:09.690 --> 02:31:11.690]  buttender's name she was beautiful she was super
[02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:13.690]  helpful and I would hire her if
[02:31:13.690 --> 02:31:15.690]  I owned a shop any day that girl knew about
[02:31:15.690 --> 02:31:17.690]  cannabis she had great skills
[02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:19.690]  I wish I remembered your name because she was awesome I don't know that she'll
[02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:21.690]  ever listen to this but she deserves a shout out
[02:31:21.690 --> 02:31:23.690]  so we go up there we get the CBD medicine
[02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:25.690]  and we got canna tonic
[02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:27.690]  canna sue and tora bora and
[02:31:27.690 --> 02:31:29.690]  they're all super high CBD strains
[02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:31.690]  and we got
[02:31:31.690 --> 02:31:33.690]  okay okay
[02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:35.690]  thank you but we get
[02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:37.690]  we get to the car I'm trying
[02:31:37.690 --> 02:31:39.690]  to be discreet here but we got to the fucking car and she wasn't
[02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:41.690]  gonna wait she rolled up the joint and
[02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:43.690]  she started smoking it and she got about
[02:31:43.690 --> 02:31:45.690]  halfway through the joint and I looked over like
[02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:47.690]  you're smoking like a lot of weed over
[02:31:47.690 --> 02:31:49.690]  there for someone that has panic attacks for smoking weed
[02:31:49.690 --> 02:31:51.690]  and she looked at me and she goes I'm
[02:31:51.690 --> 02:31:53.690]  high and smiled about it
[02:31:53.690 --> 02:31:55.690]  and I was like oh
[02:31:55.690 --> 02:31:57.690]  oh shit okay and
[02:31:57.690 --> 02:31:59.690]  it's working yeah it was definitely
[02:31:59.690 --> 02:32:01.690]  so for myself I've
[02:32:01.690 --> 02:32:03.690]  smoked a lot of CBD cannabis and I've written
[02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:05.690]  it off because it didn't seem to really do anything
[02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:07.690]  for me it didn't do I want to get high
[02:32:07.690 --> 02:32:09.690]  when I smoke pot I want to feel
[02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:11.690]  that psychedelic it's
[02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:13.690]  slightly I don't even know what to call it a head change I want to
[02:32:13.690 --> 02:32:15.690]  be fucking high I want to get high when I smoke weed
[02:32:15.690 --> 02:32:17.690]  and CBD doesn't do that so I've written
[02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:19.690]  it off if they're like this is a high
[02:32:19.690 --> 02:32:21.690]  CBD strain I'm like I'm not gonna smoke it I'll let you
[02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.690]  smoke it because you have pain enjoy it because I'm
[02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:25.690]  just wasting that dab or that joint
[02:32:25.690 --> 02:32:27.690]  and so I know
[02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:29.690]  it's helpful for patients but watching her
[02:32:29.690 --> 02:32:31.690]  it changed our entire
[02:32:31.690 --> 02:32:33.690]  day just she smoked that joint and
[02:32:33.690 --> 02:32:35.690]  half of another one and then I smoked
[02:32:35.690 --> 02:32:37.690]  half of one with her and
[02:32:37.690 --> 02:32:39.690]  I had taken a couple dabs
[02:32:39.690 --> 02:32:41.690]  we stopped to smoke on the drive and I
[02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:43.690]  we pulled over and got out and did a little hike and shit and I
[02:32:43.690 --> 02:32:45.690]  took a couple dabs but then after I smoked
[02:32:45.690 --> 02:32:47.690]  that joint it felt like my dab high
[02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:49.690]  was kind of diminished it was like
[02:32:49.690 --> 02:32:51.690]  you're not as high as you used to be
[02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:53.690]  why am I getting mellow but it made me
[02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:55.690]  higher for a really long
[02:32:55.690 --> 02:32:57.690]  time and we got giggly
[02:32:57.690 --> 02:32:59.690]  we both got kind of and I don't get giggly
[02:32:59.690 --> 02:33:01.690]  from smoking weed but
[02:33:01.690 --> 02:33:03.690]  smoking that joint of CBD after a couple of dabs
[02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:05.690]  changed dabs don't
[02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:07.690]  give me an eye high when I miss when I smoked
[02:33:07.690 --> 02:33:09.690]  weed back in the day my eyes would get all droopy
[02:33:09.690 --> 02:33:11.690]  and I'd be like damn I'm stoned dabs don't do that to me
[02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:13.690]  but the CBD weed totally
[02:33:13.690 --> 02:33:15.690]  put that back it did that so I think
[02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:17.690]  I'm missing something when I'm dabbing
[02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:19.690]  I think I need to smoke more flowers and I think I also
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.690]  need to incorporate more CBD
[02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:23.690]  excuse me I'm getting clogged up
[02:33:23.690 --> 02:33:25.690]  yeah do you feel like CBD is like
[02:33:25.690 --> 02:33:27.690]  a like a
[02:33:27.690 --> 02:33:29.690]  not to call marijuana like a
[02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:31.690]  hard drug or anything but do you feel like
[02:33:31.690 --> 02:33:33.690]  CBD is a drug unto itself
[02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:35.690]  like THC is a drug and then
[02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:37.690]  CBD is a drug
[02:33:37.690 --> 02:33:39.690]  like you like when you get
[02:33:39.690 --> 02:33:41.690]  your tolerance going for THC maybe
[02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:43.690]  that's not the same tolerance you
[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:45.690]  would have for CBD right it's a different compound
[02:33:45.690 --> 02:33:47.690]  so it's affecting a CBD receptor instead of
[02:33:47.690 --> 02:33:49.690]  a THC receptor which is also a cannabinoid
[02:33:49.690 --> 02:33:51.690]  receptor but it's going to affect you
[02:33:51.690 --> 02:33:53.690]  differently yeah well that sounds like something that
[02:33:53.690 --> 02:33:55.690]  that people should be aware of like
[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:57.690]  no it's not just marijuana it's like
[02:33:57.690 --> 02:33:59.690]  no you need to kind of know what's in that like or
[02:33:59.690 --> 02:34:01.690]  what style it is completely
[02:34:01.690 --> 02:34:03.690]  because now we're going to focus on finding
[02:34:03.690 --> 02:34:05.690]  her a lot of CBD medicine
[02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:07.690]  because she's been taught
[02:34:07.690 --> 02:34:09.690]  how far through that bowl are you
[02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:11.690]  about half way now? more than that
[02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:13.690]  I have like a hit or two left. Clint's been here
[02:34:13.690 --> 02:34:15.690]  for 30 minutes and is she a different person from

[02:34:21.690 --> 02:34:23.690]  so it's helping you it's making your headache go away
[02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:25.690]  you look better you don't look like you're trying
[02:34:25.690 --> 02:34:27.690]  to hide from the world you know when you don't feel good
[02:34:27.690 --> 02:34:29.690]  you guys you know when you don't feel good you just want to hide
[02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:31.690]  you put your hoodie on and you try to curl up into a little ball
[02:34:31.690 --> 02:34:33.690]  like you can actually almost disappear if you try hard
[02:34:33.690 --> 02:34:35.690]  enough yeah but your kids always find you
[02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:37.690]  sucks

[02:35:07.690 --> 02:35:09.690]  because normally
[02:35:09.690 --> 02:35:11.690]  I have other contacts where I can get
[02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:13.690]  marijuana from but it was
[02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:15.690]  a very nice store I like the
[02:35:15.690 --> 02:35:17.690]  people in there they were all super helpful
[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:19.690]  had no problem finding what I needed to
[02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:21.690]  find
[02:35:21.690 --> 02:35:23.690]  I liked it that was a nice store
[02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:25.690]  it's a cute little shop check it out it's under construction
[02:35:25.690 --> 02:35:27.690]  in the grow area and as soon as it's ready
[02:35:27.690 --> 02:35:29.690]  there will be some Rasta Jeff growing happening
[02:35:29.690 --> 02:35:31.690]  in there that's what I'm excited about
[02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:33.690]  yeah I get the whole world excited
[02:35:33.690 --> 02:35:35.690]  about that how much of that have you talked about
[02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:37.690]  so far on the show yeah
[02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:39.690]  not much because we haven't
[02:35:39.690 --> 02:35:41.690]  it's not super it's not my
[02:35:41.690 --> 02:35:43.690]  business yet
[02:35:43.690 --> 02:35:45.690]  if that makes any sense all your headphones cut out sometimes
[02:35:45.690 --> 02:35:47.690]  it's back it's not my business
[02:35:47.690 --> 02:35:49.690]  yet to be talking about really I feel you
[02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:51.690]  we haven't talked about what I can say
[02:35:51.690 --> 02:35:53.690]  I can say that there are
[02:35:53.690 --> 02:35:55.690]  over 200 lights
[02:35:55.690 --> 02:35:57.690]  and that it's hydro
[02:35:57.690 --> 02:35:59.690]  and that the rooms are fucking awesome
[02:35:59.690 --> 02:36:01.690]  I've been in a lot of grows a lot of big
[02:36:01.690 --> 02:36:03.690]  grows and when I walked in there I went damn you guys
[02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:05.690]  did this shit right yeah like there's
[02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:07.690]  a showroom you open these two swinging
[02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:09.690]  doors I don't know if it's double doors or one door it's a
[02:36:09.690 --> 02:36:11.690]  huge fucking door you open it and you walk in and there's
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:13.690]  a showroom that's the
[02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:15.690]  grow rooms are glass so that you can see
[02:36:15.690 --> 02:36:17.690]  into two rooms and the
[02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:19.690]  water room yeah so there will be
[02:36:19.690 --> 02:36:21.690]  they plan to do like visual
[02:36:21.690 --> 02:36:23.690]  tours and shit I'm down
[02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:25.690]  yeah get me on that yeah I just want to go
[02:36:25.690 --> 02:36:27.690]  look yeah that's awesome so
[02:36:27.690 --> 02:36:29.690]  that part of I know I can say because that's
[02:36:29.690 --> 02:36:31.690]  hyping it up we want to advertise that so
[02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:33.690]  I'm saying that's happening but I don't know what else I can say
[02:36:33.690 --> 02:36:35.690]  I'm the grower there I'm growing man
[02:36:35.690 --> 02:36:37.690]  Colorado's just cool yeah it is
[02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:39.690]  yeah I'm hoping to do a lot of things
[02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:41.690]  with her I've got ideas they've got ideas we just
[02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:43.690]  need to agree I feel you man
[02:36:43.690 --> 02:36:45.690]  yeah so she's backing up another
[02:36:45.690 --> 02:36:47.690]  bowl over there about of that CBD
[02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:49.690]  has it been other than today has it been
[02:36:49.690 --> 02:36:51.690]  helping you I know today was an extra stressful
[02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:53.690]  shitty day for you this week
[02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:55.690]  really hasn't been like as bad as
[02:36:55.690 --> 02:36:57.690]  the last like three months have been
[02:36:57.690 --> 02:36:59.690]  for sure
[02:36:59.690 --> 02:37:01.690]  I'm pretty sure if I smoke this before
[02:37:01.690 --> 02:37:03.690]  work that I would have felt better
[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:05.690]  than she would have
[02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:07.690]  had to bail out halfway through yeah
[02:37:07.690 --> 02:37:09.690]  pretty much so why would
[02:37:09.690 --> 02:37:11.690]  you do that I don't want to be at work
[02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:13.690]  me out of here luckily
[02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:15.690]  she works with the person
[02:37:15.690 --> 02:37:17.690]  that did the hippie fucking hand
[02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:19.690]  technique and he's kind of sympathetic still
[02:37:19.690 --> 02:37:21.690]  so you should play that card whenever you can
[02:37:21.690 --> 02:37:23.690]  yeah I'll be like you're the one who did it to me
[02:37:23.690 --> 02:37:25.690]  you're a fucking asshole
[02:37:25.690 --> 02:37:27.690]  you're damn hippie magic damn Vulcan hand grip
[02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:31.690]  that's basically what it is
[02:37:31.690 --> 02:37:33.690]  I'm gonna take a dab while you want to hit that bowl
[02:37:33.690 --> 02:37:35.690]  while I take a dab Clint's not smoking this evening
[02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:37.690]  Clint's off I gotta drive here pretty soon
[02:37:37.690 --> 02:37:39.690]  and I'm not uh I'm not capable
[02:37:39.690 --> 02:37:41.690]  of you can smoke this with me it won't get you high
[02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:43.690]  you know what I'm just
[02:37:43.690 --> 02:37:45.690]  it's a Saturday night and there's a UFC fight
[02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:47.690]  and there will be police everywhere where you're headed
[02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:49.690]  yeah so I'm just gonna
[02:37:49.690 --> 02:37:51.690]  chill out and hang out with the listeners
[02:37:51.690 --> 02:37:53.690]  maybe you guys are smoking maybe you're not
[02:37:53.690 --> 02:37:55.690]  I think that's the best part about this
[02:37:55.690 --> 02:37:57.690]  podcast is it's just information
[02:37:57.690 --> 02:37:59.690]  you know and they
[02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:01.690]  Jeff's doing a good job of trying to make it
[02:38:01.690 --> 02:38:03.690]  fun and educational
[02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:05.690]  I know you're making it educational
[02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:07.690]  finding that borderline
[02:38:07.690 --> 02:38:09.690]  that's the tough part is because you guys can
[02:38:09.690 --> 02:38:11.690]  ramble on about a lot of stuff
[02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:13.690]  but that's like you said earlier
[02:38:13.690 --> 02:38:15.690]  maybe I'm the guy that because I don't know
[02:38:15.690 --> 02:38:17.690]  a lot about this stuff even the questions
[02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:19.690]  between CBD and THC
[02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:21.690]  like I just don't know
[02:38:21.690 --> 02:38:23.690]  I guess I should talk more about CBD
[02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:25.690]  I don't have a book or I'm not even gonna pull up a website
[02:38:25.690 --> 02:38:27.690]  I'm just gonna kind of spat out of my head
[02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:29.690]  CBD is a cannabinoid
[02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:31.690]  I think it's pronounced cannabidiol
[02:38:31.690 --> 02:38:33.690]  it works
[02:38:33.690 --> 02:38:35.690]  more as an analgesic
[02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:37.690]  an anti-inflammatory it's known
[02:38:37.690 --> 02:38:39.690]  to have antibacterial properties
[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:41.690]  it's really well known
[02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:43.690]  for and this is a good segue it's really
[02:38:43.690 --> 02:38:45.690]  well known for stopping people who have
[02:38:45.690 --> 02:38:47.690]  tremors and seizure type disorders
[02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:49.690]  or conditions
[02:38:49.690 --> 02:38:51.690]  I won't even call it a disorder that's a condition
[02:38:51.690 --> 02:38:53.690]  calling it a disorder makes it sound like you're fucking condemned
[02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:55.690]  or something
[02:38:55.690 --> 02:38:57.690]  people with seizure conditions
[02:38:57.690 --> 02:38:59.690]  I was telling a random story
[02:38:59.690 --> 02:39:01.690]  that I will tell on this show in a second
[02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:03.690]  I was telling a story to a friend who was a paramedic
[02:39:03.690 --> 02:39:05.690]  and she said
[02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:07.690]  that CBD
[02:39:07.690 --> 02:39:09.690]  stops an electrical
[02:39:09.690 --> 02:39:11.690]  firing in your brain that causes
[02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:13.690]  seizures
[02:39:13.690 --> 02:39:15.690]  that's awesome
[02:39:15.690 --> 02:39:17.690]  that's gonna be really helpful for anybody
[02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:19.690]  with seizures CBD definitely
[02:39:19.690 --> 02:39:21.690]  makes me hungry that's why I'm not
[02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:23.690]  smoking that bowl
[02:39:23.690 --> 02:39:25.690]  my first or second hit off of CBD my stomach goes
[02:39:25.690 --> 02:39:27.690]  brrrr
[02:39:27.690 --> 02:39:29.690]  so if you got some cancer and you're not eaten from the
[02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:31.690]  chemotherapy dude smoke some
[02:39:31.690 --> 02:39:33.690]  canna tonic
[02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:35.690]  that stuff makes me starve
[02:39:35.690 --> 02:39:37.690]  we went to lunch and then smoked
[02:39:37.690 --> 02:39:39.690]  right after lunch and I was like
[02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:41.690]  we gotta go back in there
[02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:43.690]  yeah when I'm full I'll get hungry
[02:39:43.690 --> 02:39:45.010]  from smoking the can of tonics.
[02:39:45.010 --> 02:39:47.210]  Yeah, that stuff just makes you want to eat.
[02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:51.850]  Um, it made my ... I can play guitar longer.
[02:39:51.850 --> 02:39:53.570]  I've noticed that I got a new guitar for Christmas,
[02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:54.650]  and I've noticed if I play too long,
[02:39:54.650 --> 02:39:57.010]  my wrists and my forearm and fingers hurt.
[02:39:57.010 --> 02:39:58.370]  I don't ... I can just keep going now.
[02:39:58.370 --> 02:40:00.770]  Really? And I may just be building up endurance,
[02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:02.930]  but I don't feel any pain from it.
[02:40:02.930 --> 02:40:05.050]  I would cramp up after a while, and now I'm not.
[02:40:05.050 --> 02:40:08.450]  So, this CBD stuff is, instead of like the head high
[02:40:08.450 --> 02:40:11.850]  that I normally get where I'm just flying through the cosmos,
[02:40:11.850 --> 02:40:13.610]  now it's more of a body high.
[02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:14.930]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:17.250]  You would probably experience a body high
[02:40:17.250 --> 02:40:20.090]  because you're really low tolerance to any cannabinoids.
[02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:21.530]  For sure, I am.
[02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:23.090]  But people that have smoked a little bit,
[02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:24.690]  it just goes straight to pain.
[02:40:24.690 --> 02:40:26.330]  I feel like it knows where the pain is.
[02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:27.490]  It's like, oh, your arm hurts?
[02:40:27.490 --> 02:40:28.730]  I'm going to drive right up to your arm.
[02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:31.090]  I'm going to park here, let out my little CBD paramedics,
[02:40:31.090 --> 02:40:33.130]  and we're going to work on your arm or your head
[02:40:33.130 --> 02:40:34.730]  or your neck and shoulders
[02:40:34.730 --> 02:40:36.930]  because she's had a lot of weird symptoms lately.
[02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:38.930]  Sorry I cut off my description of what cannabidiol is,
[02:40:38.930 --> 02:40:41.170]  but it's a cannabinoid. It's the opposite of THC.
[02:40:41.170 --> 02:40:43.170]  It's the one that goes down instead of up,
[02:40:44.050 --> 02:40:45.770]  I think it tastes like cherries.
[02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:47.410]  I definitely think that a lot of herb
[02:40:47.410 --> 02:40:50.690]  that has CBD in it and extracts made with CBD,
[02:40:50.690 --> 02:40:54.650]  they often have a cherry, like a cherry Hall's cough drop
[02:40:54.650 --> 02:40:56.450]  or a Luden's kind of a taste to it.
[02:40:56.450 --> 02:40:58.450]  That's what I've always thought of CBD.
[02:40:58.450 --> 02:40:59.730]  I'm high on random.
[02:40:59.730 --> 02:41:01.690]  I've talked about how it affects me. It makes me hungry.
[02:41:01.690 --> 02:41:04.210]  It made me really mellow. It made me kind of smiley,
[02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:06.530]  like put a grin on my face, like a giggle.
[02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:09.170]  And then here's a really random story.
[02:41:09.170 --> 02:41:10.650]  You ready for this one over there?
[02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:12.290]  Oh, gosh, I know where this is going.
[02:41:12.290 --> 02:41:16.010]  Yeah. So we had a long day.
[02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:18.370]  We went to Springs and bought some cannabis,
[02:41:18.370 --> 02:41:19.570]  which is an hour drive away.
[02:41:19.570 --> 02:41:21.650]  We went to lunch and then we came home
[02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:26.170]  and like two beautiful people do, we got naked.
[02:41:27.610 --> 02:41:30.850]  And we're both loving what we were doing.
[02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:35.170]  And after about an hour of us giving it to each other,
[02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:38.810]  I kind of looked at her like, I love what you're doing,
[02:41:38.810 --> 02:41:41.290]  but I'm never going to finish.
[02:41:41.290 --> 02:41:42.770]  Like, this is perfect.
[02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:47.170]  You've done everything I love and this is not going to happen.
[02:41:47.170 --> 02:41:48.130]  Like nothing's wrong.
[02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:50.050]  And she kind of looked at me like me too,
[02:41:50.050 --> 02:41:51.170]  and I'm going to embarrass you,
[02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:53.650]  but it usually doesn't take much for her to be done.
[02:41:53.650 --> 02:41:56.370]  Like she gets three to my one because she's a girl
[02:41:56.370 --> 02:41:58.610]  and I'm not complaining, but I mean, I didn't even see one.
[02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:00.690]  She's obvious when it happens. I didn't see one.
[02:42:00.690 --> 02:42:02.570]  And I was like, well, she's not either.
[02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:04.730]  And so she goes, I think that CBD,
[02:42:04.730 --> 02:42:06.450]  and I was thinking it right as she said it.
[02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:08.930]  She goes, I think that CBD weed killed it.
[02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:11.170]  And it was the whole time it was happening,
[02:42:11.530 --> 02:42:13.050]  I was almost there.
[02:42:13.050 --> 02:42:15.290]  So it was fucking amazing the entire time,
[02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:18.170]  but it just wouldn't, there was no grand finale.
[02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:19.970]  Yeah, no grand finale there.
[02:42:19.970 --> 02:42:21.450]  And I was like, it's not you.
[02:42:21.450 --> 02:42:22.530]  And she's like, it's not you.
[02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:25.130]  So I talked to my paramedic friend
[02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:29.770]  and she said that that same electrical firing in your brain
[02:42:29.770 --> 02:42:32.170]  that causes a seizure is the same one
[02:42:32.170 --> 02:42:33.930]  that causes you to orgasm.
[02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:36.970]  And by smoking CBD, you pretty much just turn
[02:42:36.970 --> 02:42:38.330]  that sucker off.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:40.610]  And she said that opiates will do it times 10.
[02:42:41.050 --> 02:42:42.810]  She's like, good luck getting a boner on opiates.
[02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:44.330]  I was like, I'm never really.
[02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:46.570]  Yeah, I'm not really into opiates, but okay.
[02:42:46.570 --> 02:42:48.050]  She said it just straight turns off
[02:42:48.050 --> 02:42:50.210]  that electrical firing mechanism in your brain
[02:42:50.210 --> 02:42:52.610]  to where you'll never come, never.
[02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:53.810]  She said you probably could,
[02:42:53.810 --> 02:42:57.450]  but it's gonna take a lot more effort than what,
[02:42:57.450 --> 02:42:59.810]  I really like her, I didn't wanna try that hard.
[02:43:01.210 --> 02:43:03.210]  Like a gallon of sweat later.
[02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:05.330]  Yeah, my legs were sore and I was kinda sweaty.
[02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:06.570]  And I'm hungry.
[02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:09.330]  I was like, you're cute as fuck and this is great,
[02:43:09.370 --> 02:43:11.170]  but I'm gonna take a brain check.
[02:43:12.210 --> 02:43:13.330]  I've had to do that before.
[02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:14.930]  That's whiskey dick for me though.
[02:43:14.930 --> 02:43:15.770]  Yeah, well.
[02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:17.490]  No, I guess I'm not finishing today.
[02:43:17.490 --> 02:43:19.530]  I had CBD dick, dude.
[02:43:19.530 --> 02:43:21.330]  It was working, but it just wasn't.
[02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:23.010]  You got that CBD dick.
[02:43:24.010 --> 02:43:25.730]  There's been a few times you won't even smoke
[02:43:25.730 --> 02:43:27.850]  my CBD weed for that reason.
[02:43:27.850 --> 02:43:28.690]  Well, yeah.
[02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:30.570]  People don't ask for dinner or something.
[02:43:30.570 --> 02:43:33.770]  It's like, hey, I'm not gonna smoke that wink wink.
[02:43:36.330 --> 02:43:38.170]  Honestly, part of the reason I don't smoke it
[02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:40.250]  is because we bought a limited supply
[02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:41.090]  and I don't need to waste it.
[02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:43.090]  It doesn't do much for me other than make me hungry
[02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:44.450]  and not make me nuts.
[02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:45.930]  What's the price comparison on it?
[02:43:45.930 --> 02:43:48.570]  You know, that dispensary is very completely fair.
[02:43:48.570 --> 02:43:52.090]  And they have three different price points of that herb
[02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:54.250]  and it averages at $200 an ounce,
[02:43:54.250 --> 02:43:55.890]  but it's a medical only shop.
[02:43:55.890 --> 02:43:56.730]  Oh, I feel you.
[02:43:56.730 --> 02:43:58.370]  Yeah, so you have to have a medical card to get in there,
[02:43:58.370 --> 02:44:01.130]  but $200 an ounce is a very good price
[02:44:01.130 --> 02:44:02.570]  because she works at a dispensary.
[02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:04.170]  And did you sell an ounce today?
[02:44:05.130 --> 02:44:09.330]  No, we barely ever because it's like 560 out the door
[02:44:09.330 --> 02:44:10.170]  or something.
[02:44:10.170 --> 02:44:11.450]  After taxes and everything?
[02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:12.770]  Yeah, after tax.
[02:44:12.770 --> 02:44:16.130]  You have to buy a little white bag that locks
[02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:18.170]  to even carry your ounce out in.
[02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:19.490]  It's like the first accessory.
[02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:20.930]  You didn't even like,
[02:44:20.930 --> 02:44:22.810]  because you have to have that to leave the dispensary
[02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:23.890]  because that's childproof.
[02:44:23.890 --> 02:44:25.810]  That's how the dispensary watches their ass.
[02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:26.650]  Wow.
[02:44:26.650 --> 02:44:27.490]  Yeah.
[02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:29.170]  That's weird.
[02:44:29.170 --> 02:44:30.730]  I didn't know that.
[02:44:30.730 --> 02:44:32.810]  So they actually have to sell you that bag
[02:44:32.810 --> 02:44:35.370]  or that's kind of like given with the 560.
[02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:36.370]  That's with the 560,
[02:44:36.370 --> 02:44:38.610]  but they could, some dispensaries charge you for that.
[02:44:38.610 --> 02:44:40.090]  Is that with the 560?
[02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:42.250]  Well, we have the childproof bottles
[02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:46.210]  and then we are supposed to charge for the bags for edibles,
[02:44:46.210 --> 02:44:48.610]  but most of the time we just give them to people.
[02:44:48.610 --> 02:44:49.890]  Because they're buying a lot of stuff.
[02:44:49.890 --> 02:44:50.810]  Yeah.
[02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:52.450]  Recreational is expensive.
[02:44:52.450 --> 02:44:53.810]  They stock up at that shop.
[02:44:53.810 --> 02:44:57.050]  The people really like to stock up when they come.
[02:44:57.050 --> 02:44:58.210]  It's fun watching them shop.
[02:44:58.210 --> 02:44:59.930]  People are mesmerized.
[02:44:59.930 --> 02:45:00.930]  Guys, come to a dispensary.
[02:45:00.930 --> 02:45:03.770]  If you're from another state, drive out to Colorado,
[02:45:03.770 --> 02:45:04.930]  go to the spot dispensary.
[02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:06.450]  If you're coming from the South, go to the spot.
[02:45:06.450 --> 02:45:08.970]  If you're up North, dude, go to like,
[02:45:08.970 --> 02:45:10.370]  I don't even know who to tell you to up North.
[02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:12.970]  I'll find a good spot and I'll recommend them soon.
[02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:15.370]  But come to the spot in Pueblo West, Colorado,
[02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:16.210]  check it out.
[02:45:16.210 --> 02:45:18.090]  They've got such cool shit in there.
[02:45:18.090 --> 02:45:20.690]  They've got like 25 strains of herb on the shelf.
[02:45:20.690 --> 02:45:22.490]  If you've never been in a dispensary
[02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:26.090]  and somebody shows you 25 jars full of cannabis,
[02:45:26.090 --> 02:45:28.690]  you're going to smell every single one of them.
[02:45:28.690 --> 02:45:30.530]  The bud tender is going to start tapping their foot
[02:45:31.170 --> 02:45:32.010]  because they've seen them all.
[02:45:32.010 --> 02:45:34.570]  But just look at every one of them and enjoy them.
[02:45:34.570 --> 02:45:35.570]  I'm sorry I'm doing that to you.
[02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:37.290]  I know you're the bud tender and I'm telling them to do that
[02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:38.130]  but enjoy them.
[02:45:38.130 --> 02:45:39.050]  Check that shit out, dude.
[02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:40.730]  Spoil yourself the first time.
[02:45:40.730 --> 02:45:42.850]  But look, it is so freaking neat.
[02:45:42.850 --> 02:45:45.210]  Like I remember the first time I went into a weed store.
[02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:46.850]  It's amazing and I'm from here.
[02:45:46.850 --> 02:45:49.610]  Yeah, well, either that or save yourself some money
[02:45:49.610 --> 02:45:51.090]  and start growing your own.
[02:45:51.090 --> 02:45:52.810]  Harold, make up for telling them to take all day.
[02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:54.370]  The bud tenders do accept tips.
[02:45:54.370 --> 02:45:55.770]  There's a tip jar on the counter.
[02:45:55.770 --> 02:45:57.330]  Make sure you toss some shit in there.
[02:45:57.330 --> 02:45:58.170]  Big tips.
[02:45:58.170 --> 02:46:00.130]  It's only 600 bucks for an ounce out the door.
[02:46:00.970 --> 02:46:03.050]  Well, most people are from out of state
[02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:04.610]  and they can only buy a quarter anyways.
[02:46:04.610 --> 02:46:06.170]  They drove all the way here.
[02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:07.010]  Yeah.
[02:46:07.010 --> 02:46:11.850]  Just to, I mean, I'm an open mic comedian.
[02:46:11.850 --> 02:46:13.730]  I'm sure if anybody's heard me before,
[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:15.930]  they know how unfunny I am most of the time
[02:46:15.930 --> 02:46:18.650]  but I'm not trying to say I'm a comedian.
[02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:19.970]  I'm just saying I'm an open mic-er.
[02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:22.090]  But that's like one of my big things
[02:46:22.090 --> 02:46:23.850]  is just how cool Colorado is
[02:46:23.850 --> 02:46:25.450]  compared to everybody else around us.
[02:46:25.450 --> 02:46:26.290]  Yeah.
[02:46:26.290 --> 02:46:28.370]  God, it must suck being from Utah.
[02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:29.210]  Oh yeah.
[02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:30.330]  Or Wyoming.
[02:46:30.330 --> 02:46:31.170]  God, yeah.
[02:46:31.170 --> 02:46:32.010]  Or Kansas.
[02:46:32.010 --> 02:46:32.850]  Yeah.
[02:46:32.850 --> 02:46:33.690]  Or New Mexico.
[02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:34.530]  Yeah.
[02:46:34.530 --> 02:46:36.650]  I hear I hate Texas at least 15 times a day.
[02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:39.130]  Most of my customers are probably,
[02:46:39.130 --> 02:46:43.450]  50% of the customers seem like they're all from Texas.
[02:46:43.450 --> 02:46:44.290]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:45.490]  So they hate Texas
[02:46:45.490 --> 02:46:47.010]  because they have to drive from there
[02:46:47.010 --> 02:46:49.090]  just to get legal weed?
[02:46:49.090 --> 02:46:49.930]  Yeah.
[02:46:49.930 --> 02:46:50.810]  That's ridiculous.
[02:46:50.810 --> 02:46:51.650]  Yeah.
[02:46:51.650 --> 02:46:52.690]  It's changing though, man.
[02:46:52.690 --> 02:46:53.890]  The world's changing.
[02:46:53.890 --> 02:46:55.210]  Yeah.
[02:46:55.210 --> 02:46:56.530]  Guys, do what you can where you are
[02:46:56.530 --> 02:46:58.450]  to get cannabis legalized in your area
[02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:59.410]  so that you don't have to drive
[02:46:59.410 --> 02:47:00.930]  all the way to Pueblo, Colorado
[02:47:00.930 --> 02:47:03.050]  to come by an eighth for like 70 bucks.
[02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:06.170]  Speaking of people making changes,
[02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:08.810]  I wanted to give a shout out to our buddy Mike
[02:47:08.810 --> 02:47:11.330]  for holding it down at the city council stuff.
[02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:12.170]  Appreciate it.
[02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:14.730]  Neil Punk, you're really kicking ass, man.
[02:47:14.730 --> 02:47:15.570]  Yeah.
[02:47:15.570 --> 02:47:16.410]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:16.410 --> 02:47:18.450]  He does 12 hour days, 13, 14 hour days
[02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:20.450]  just so that he's able to get to the city council meetings.
[02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:21.970]  I think he got to work at six the other day
[02:47:21.970 --> 02:47:23.970]  and finally got home from city council at 1030.
[02:47:23.970 --> 02:47:25.650]  So however many hours that is,
[02:47:25.650 --> 02:47:27.730]  Mike's putting them in for us so that we can grow,
[02:47:27.730 --> 02:47:30.570]  so that we can smoke, so that we can do what we do here
[02:47:30.570 --> 02:47:34.170]  and not feel like criminals again in our local area.
[02:47:34.170 --> 02:47:35.010]  Yeah.
[02:47:35.010 --> 02:47:36.010]  And the 719.
[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:36.850]  So shout out to Mike.
[02:47:36.850 --> 02:47:38.250]  That's a good, thanks for reminding me of that.
[02:47:38.250 --> 02:47:39.330]  Well, weren't you saying something?
[02:47:39.330 --> 02:47:40.570]  We were driving up yesterday.
[02:47:40.570 --> 02:47:42.010]  We got talking and I asked, how's Mike?
[02:47:42.010 --> 02:47:44.250]  He said, well, they got this kind of thing going on
[02:47:44.250 --> 02:47:46.330]  and they were talking about like your backyard stuff.
[02:47:46.330 --> 02:47:48.170]  Do you want Mike in here to talk about that better
[02:47:48.170 --> 02:47:51.650]  or like how a city council's trying to make it
[02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:53.530]  to where we can have less plants in our backyard
[02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:54.370]  or something like that?
[02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:55.210]  Yeah.
[02:47:55.210 --> 02:47:56.530]  Well, we've kind of talked about a little bit
[02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:57.970]  about that on the show.
[02:47:57.970 --> 02:47:59.530]  City council is trying to limit us
[02:47:59.530 --> 02:48:01.330]  to like six plants per household.
[02:48:01.330 --> 02:48:03.010]  Then you have to grow it in an out building,
[02:48:03.010 --> 02:48:04.650]  not attached to your house.
[02:48:04.650 --> 02:48:07.290]  And Mike and I, Mike mostly,
[02:48:07.290 --> 02:48:09.090]  but since I know a lot about growing,
[02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:10.090]  I was able to contribute a lot,
[02:48:10.090 --> 02:48:12.250]  but Mike wrote pages and pages and pages
[02:48:12.250 --> 02:48:13.490]  on why that's ridiculous.
[02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:14.690]  And he's been going to every,
[02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:18.210]  he goes to the planning and zoning,
[02:48:18.210 --> 02:48:20.570]  the city council, city commissioners,
[02:48:20.570 --> 02:48:22.890]  any meeting that he can sit in and go,
[02:48:22.890 --> 02:48:24.690]  this is why that shit's bullshit.
[02:48:24.690 --> 02:48:25.730]  And he shows up and puts it,
[02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:27.930]  and he's working at like a 45 hour a week job
[02:48:27.930 --> 02:48:29.370]  doing construction too.
[02:48:29.370 --> 02:48:30.890]  So he's putting it in and he's doing,
[02:48:30.890 --> 02:48:33.650]  he's actually building grows for the Denver Bud Company.
[02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:34.730]  That is so cool.
[02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:37.770]  All day long, he's cannabising in some way or another.
[02:48:37.770 --> 02:48:39.050]  But just, thanks Mike.
[02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:40.030]  We appreciate it.
[02:48:40.930 --> 02:48:43.530]  If you're on Twitter, follow Mike, what's he, Neopunk?
[02:48:43.530 --> 02:48:46.050]  Nemo Punk, and then there's numbers after it.
[02:48:46.050 --> 02:48:46.890]  13.
[02:48:46.890 --> 02:48:47.730]  Yeah, well.
[02:48:47.730 --> 02:48:48.550]  27.
[02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:49.390]  Something, yeah.
[02:48:49.390 --> 02:48:50.230]  53.
[02:48:50.230 --> 02:48:51.050]  Yeah.
[02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:51.890]  Uh-huh.
[02:48:51.890 --> 02:48:54.130]  It'll be in the show notes for sure.
[02:48:54.130 --> 02:48:54.970]  Yeah.
[02:48:55.410 --> 02:48:56.330]  Here, I'll look at my Twitter.
[02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:59.250]  You know what, follow me, I'm following him.
[02:48:59.250 --> 02:49:01.170]  I'm not even gonna say mine now.
[02:49:01.170 --> 02:49:02.010]  I'm over it.
[02:49:02.010 --> 02:49:02.830]  Twitter's too slow.
[02:49:02.830 --> 02:49:04.410]  I feel like I'm wasting too much time.
[02:49:04.410 --> 02:49:07.370]  Oh, can we talk about the weed brain
[02:49:07.370 --> 02:49:08.570]  I got on the way up there?
[02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:09.410]  My goldfish memory.
[02:49:09.410 --> 02:49:10.250]  The goldfish brain?
[02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:11.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.910]  Oh, my goldfish memory,
[02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:13.130]  because I have such a low tolerance.
[02:49:13.130 --> 02:49:16.930]  We smoked before we, I smoked here, I smoked one hit.
[02:49:16.930 --> 02:49:18.410]  And this is the funniest thing to me,
[02:49:18.410 --> 02:49:20.290]  because I know it's gonna happen.
[02:49:20.290 --> 02:49:22.810]  And I wanna hold a conversation with people,
[02:49:22.810 --> 02:49:26.090]  but I smoke one hit off of my little pipe,
[02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:28.930]  and I am like 30 seconds, I'm like,
[02:49:28.930 --> 02:49:30.410]  what was I talking about?
[02:49:30.410 --> 02:49:32.010]  And it's every 30 seconds.
[02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:33.350]  It's hilarious too.
[02:49:33.350 --> 02:49:34.190]  It is hilarious.
[02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:36.050]  But I know it's happening, so I tell Jeff,
[02:49:36.050 --> 02:49:37.090]  like, yeah, I just don't remember
[02:49:37.090 --> 02:49:37.930]  what we were talking about.
[02:49:37.930 --> 02:49:40.170]  And he's like, dude, it was four seconds ago.
[02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:41.810]  And I'm like, I just don't remember, I'm sorry.
[02:49:41.810 --> 02:49:44.590]  We get off on these tangents, I get excited.
[02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:46.570]  There was a pause at one point when we were driving.
[02:49:46.570 --> 02:49:47.890]  I don't remember who was talking,
[02:49:47.890 --> 02:49:50.010]  but there was a pause, and we looked at each other,
[02:49:50.010 --> 02:49:51.290]  and I just go, I don't remember.
[02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:52.250]  I don't remember.
[02:49:52.250 --> 02:49:55.010]  It was just an unspoken, I don't know.
[02:49:55.010 --> 02:49:56.290]  I don't fucking remember.
[02:49:56.290 --> 02:49:57.530]  It's gone.
[02:49:57.530 --> 02:49:59.050]  So if you're trying to hold a conversation,
[02:49:59.050 --> 02:50:01.130]  or if you're trying to be the cool guy,
[02:50:01.130 --> 02:50:04.170]  maybe marijuana for the first time
[02:50:04.170 --> 02:50:06.210]  isn't the right thing to do.
[02:50:06.210 --> 02:50:08.450]  And I wasn't even planning on smoking at the show.
[02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:10.130]  I was just like, ah, we'll get back to the car.
[02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:12.150]  I'll smoke in the car, and we'll head back.
[02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:14.250]  But then when Ari Shaffir passes the joint to you,
[02:50:14.250 --> 02:50:16.530]  it's like, ah, you know, I probably should.
[02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:17.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:20.690]  You were silent until we got to the gas station to get gas.
[02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:22.490]  I was looking out the window,
[02:50:22.490 --> 02:50:25.410]  just enjoying, just thinking, oh man.
[02:50:26.530 --> 02:50:27.850]  It was so pretty out too.
[02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:29.490]  And then I think I said one thing.
[02:50:29.490 --> 02:50:31.530]  I go, Denver's so pretty.
[02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:32.370]  That was it.
[02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:34.610]  Yeah, it was a beautiful night in Denver.
[02:50:34.610 --> 02:50:36.010]  I couldn't ask for a better evening.
[02:50:36.010 --> 02:50:37.650]  Other than those damn horses.
[02:50:38.730 --> 02:50:42.470]  So Jeff, my boy Jeff here has had nightmares,
[02:50:42.470 --> 02:50:45.250]  and he's afraid of horse-drawn carriages.
[02:50:45.250 --> 02:50:46.770]  That's true.
[02:50:46.770 --> 02:50:47.710]  He let me know this.
[02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:50.610]  So every time a horse-drawn carriage was coming our way,
[02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:54.250]  I just punched that horse right in the face.
[02:50:54.250 --> 02:50:55.690]  Tell it, get out of here.
[02:50:55.690 --> 02:50:58.650]  Yeah, no, there were boundaries drawn.
[02:50:58.650 --> 02:51:00.290]  And if that horse got that far,
[02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:01.810]  then that was when the punch would come.
[02:51:01.810 --> 02:51:03.650]  But luckily, you never had to drop that horse.
[02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:06.450]  I really wanted to see you just fucking sucker punch
[02:51:06.450 --> 02:51:07.650]  a goddamn giant horse.
[02:51:07.650 --> 02:51:08.690]  That would've been so great.
[02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:10.850]  I was just gonna cone in that horse.
[02:51:10.850 --> 02:51:12.090]  Just boom.
[02:51:13.450 --> 02:51:14.530]  It's not a tuma.
[02:51:15.450 --> 02:51:16.430]  I know what would've been a good tagline
[02:51:16.430 --> 02:51:17.530]  after you punch a horse.
[02:51:17.530 --> 02:51:18.370]  I don't know.
[02:51:19.290 --> 02:51:20.130]  I'll think of one.
[02:51:20.130 --> 02:51:20.970]  Not on my watch.
[02:51:22.530 --> 02:51:24.530]  Something really random.
[02:51:24.530 --> 02:51:25.570]  Not on my watch.
[02:51:25.570 --> 02:51:27.530]  I don't know any horse names.
[02:51:27.530 --> 02:51:31.650]  Like Secretariat, I got nothing, man.
[02:51:31.650 --> 02:51:32.490]  Okay.
[02:51:32.490 --> 02:51:35.770]  I have the Kentucky Derby of dropping horses over here.
[02:51:35.770 --> 02:51:38.570]  The honest truth, I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico
[02:51:38.570 --> 02:51:40.850]  for a short period of my time, of my life,
[02:51:40.850 --> 02:51:43.410]  and I had a dream, a nightmare, that on the,
[02:51:43.410 --> 02:51:44.250]  well, this actually happened.
[02:51:44.250 --> 02:51:47.390]  On the plaza in Santa Fe, there are horse-drawn carriages
[02:51:47.390 --> 02:51:49.070]  carrying yuppie folk around all the time,
[02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:51.870]  just on dates and shit, and they got Christmas lights
[02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:53.950]  and candles on them and shit, and they're all snazzy.
[02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:56.110]  I had a dream one night that I was in my car
[02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:58.110]  and I could see this horse-drawn carriage
[02:51:58.110 --> 02:52:00.510]  up the road crossing the street,
[02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:02.350]  and I just could not stop.
[02:52:02.350 --> 02:52:04.630]  I was only going normal speed.
[02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:06.910]  I wasn't going over 45 or 50 in my dream,
[02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:09.470]  but my car and I were like, stop.
[02:52:09.470 --> 02:52:10.310]  Nope.
[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:11.190]  Stop.
[02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:12.030]  Nope.
[02:52:12.030 --> 02:52:14.430]  And I plowed into the horse-drawn carriage
[02:52:14.430 --> 02:52:17.350]  with people in the carriage and it was chaos,
[02:52:17.350 --> 02:52:18.570]  and it scarred me, bro.
[02:52:18.570 --> 02:52:20.030]  I woke up, oh no, I'm sorry.
[02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:22.270]  I didn't mean to kill the horse.
[02:52:22.270 --> 02:52:23.630]  And so now when I see the horse-drawn carriage
[02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:25.190]  and I'm driving, I'll fucking turn left
[02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:26.390]  and go somewhere else, dude.
[02:52:26.390 --> 02:52:29.390]  Like, they can just ramble on and I'll backtrack.
[02:52:29.390 --> 02:52:30.750]  I'll be back when you're not around.
[02:52:30.750 --> 02:52:32.070]  Yeah, there was a lot of them, too.
[02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:33.470]  A lot of them last night in Denver.
[02:52:33.470 --> 02:52:34.990]  That part of like the 16th Street Mall
[02:52:34.990 --> 02:52:36.190]  loves horse-drawn carriages.
[02:52:36.190 --> 02:52:37.030]  Hey, speaking of which.
[02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:38.830]  And yoga pants and Ugg boots.
[02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:39.670]  That was the nice part.
[02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:41.230]  It's like the uniform.
[02:52:41.270 --> 02:52:45.110]  Yeah, horses and yoga pants is crazy, dude.
[02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:46.510]  I didn't know what to think.
[02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:49.750]  Stretch them out.
[02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:50.590]  Stretch them out.
[02:52:50.590 --> 02:52:52.230]  One size fits all, apparently.
[02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:53.070]  The hole for the tail.
[02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:54.310]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[02:52:54.310 --> 02:52:56.470]  Noah, what was the place we ate at, that pizza place?
[02:52:56.470 --> 02:52:57.790]  Oh, the Mellow Mushroom.
[02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:59.390]  Hey, shout out to the Mellow Mushroom.
[02:52:59.390 --> 02:53:00.230]  That was yummy.
[02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:01.070]  Oh, this is dank.
[02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:01.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:01.890 --> 02:53:02.730]  That was yummy.
[02:53:02.730 --> 02:53:03.550]  So delicious.
[02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:04.390]  The dankness.
[02:53:04.390 --> 02:53:05.230]  Thanks, guys.
[02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:06.070]  Yeah, dude, that was a great trip.
[02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:07.470]  Thanks for making that happen.
[02:53:07.470 --> 02:53:08.310]  That was your fault.
[02:53:08.310 --> 02:53:09.430]  Hey, you drove, man.
[02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:10.990]  I appreciate you driving.
[02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:12.710]  There's no way I can get high and drive.
[02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:13.950]  I'm not seasoned.
[02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:15.870]  There's no way.
[02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:16.830]  I didn't get high and drive.
[02:53:16.830 --> 02:53:17.670]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:18.510]  I didn't say you did.
[02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:20.150]  I said I got high before we left.
[02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:22.670]  I took like six dabs, but I didn't get high and drive.
[02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:24.430]  Yeah, don't drive high, please.
[02:53:24.430 --> 02:53:25.710]  Like, that's it.
[02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:26.550]  Don't drive high.
[02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:29.110]  Be a, know your limits.
[02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:31.870]  Well, then we got talking about why Jeff doesn't drive
[02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:34.030]  when he's like cashed.
[02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:37.510]  That's because Jeff's kind of an ambassador for,
[02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:39.830]  as I see it.
[02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:41.710]  Like with this podcast and stuff like that,
[02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:46.350]  you're trying to make weed as acceptable as possible.
[02:53:46.350 --> 02:53:49.310]  And you know, yes, you look like a hippie.
[02:53:49.310 --> 02:53:50.870]  I mean, you both got dreads,
[02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:56.950]  but you don't need to be making the classic mistakes
[02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:59.870]  that every stoner movie like showcases.
[02:53:59.870 --> 02:54:02.510]  Like, oh, he's so stoned that he can't get off the couch.
[02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:04.950]  Or, oh, he's seeing six shades of gray
[02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:05.910]  or something like that
[02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:08.870]  because he smoked himself colorblind or some shit.
[02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:09.750]  I don't know.
[02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:12.790]  It's the dude wears my car effect
[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:14.070]  where everybody's an idiot.
[02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:16.390]  What kind of brought it up was there was,
[02:54:16.390 --> 02:54:18.030]  traffic was going crazy up ahead of us
[02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:19.550]  and I wasn't sure what happened.
[02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:24.070]  And I said, pay attention to which way the turn signals go.
[02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:25.950]  And Clint found that to be some sort of
[02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:28.070]  genius fucking observation.
[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:29.510]  Because the mile ahead,
[02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:30.950]  I can see the turn signals flickering.
[02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:32.950]  And I know if I need to start going left or right now,
[02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:34.390]  because I'm just going to copy the turn signals
[02:54:34.390 --> 02:54:35.390]  and I'll be in the proper lane
[02:54:35.390 --> 02:54:37.190]  instead of fighting for it when I get up there.
[02:54:37.230 --> 02:54:39.790]  Yeah, getting cut off by two Priuses was not cool.
[02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:42.790]  That dude, you weren't supposed to talk about that
[02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:43.830]  on the show.
[02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:45.830]  I was passed by a fucking Prius
[02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:47.750]  and it felt very emasculating.
[02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:50.510]  You have a soccer bomb car though, you're asking for it.
[02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:51.350]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:54:51.350 --> 02:54:52.190]  That's true.
[02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:54.030]  It happened twice.
[02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:54.870]  Meow.
[02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:56.790]  That's a Prius, dude.
[02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:58.870]  I know, that was the best part.
[02:54:58.870 --> 02:55:01.990]  Anyway, so yeah, turn signals are going on up ahead
[02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:04.270]  and I was just stoned enough to go,
[02:55:04.270 --> 02:55:06.230]  oh, that was really smart, man.
[02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:09.670]  And I was like, well, I got to pay extra attention
[02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:11.350]  and be a little more on top of it
[02:55:11.350 --> 02:55:13.110]  because I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:16.030]  I'm wearing an iRegenetics Colorado Cannabis T-shirt.
[02:55:16.030 --> 02:55:17.310]  The car reeks of dink,
[02:55:17.310 --> 02:55:19.150]  even though the herb is in the back of the car,
[02:55:19.150 --> 02:55:21.950]  in the backpack, in a bag, it just reeks.
[02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:24.910]  I look like a pothead and I don't want to be pulled over
[02:55:24.910 --> 02:55:26.270]  on the side of the road in a wreck.
[02:55:26.270 --> 02:55:27.790]  And they're going, look at this stupid pothead,
[02:55:27.790 --> 02:55:29.870]  high as shit, did something dumb.
[02:55:29.870 --> 02:55:32.830]  I don't want that because I will scar the community.
[02:55:32.830 --> 02:55:34.630]  I feel like, and this is what kind of brought this up.
[02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:36.110]  I feel like I kind of represent,
[02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:38.150]  I feel like I've chosen to represent the community,
[02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:40.110]  not just myself, there are a lot of us that do it,
[02:55:40.110 --> 02:55:42.670]  but I'm one of the people that have chosen to speak out
[02:55:42.670 --> 02:55:44.950]  and put myself in the spotlight for cannabis.
[02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:48.550]  And I need to be not a malnourished, too skinny dude.
[02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:51.670]  I need to not be the cliche on the couch guy.
[02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:53.910]  I need to not be fucking-
[02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:55.950]  The red eyed in every picture that you see.
[02:55:55.950 --> 02:55:57.630]  Well, that's why I got sunglasses on all the time.
[02:55:57.630 --> 02:55:58.510]  And that's what I wanted to,
[02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:59.710]  I kind of wanted to bring that up.
[02:55:59.710 --> 02:56:01.550]  So that way maybe some of our friends
[02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:03.150]  who are taking the red eyed pictures,
[02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:04.870]  maybe they'll be like, oh, you know what?
[02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:07.630]  Maybe the cliche stoner isn't really
[02:56:07.630 --> 02:56:11.110]  what we want to be showcasing to middle America,
[02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:15.470]  white America who doesn't, I mean, I'm a cracker.
[02:56:15.470 --> 02:56:18.510]  It's just, and for the longest time it was,
[02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:21.070]  it was something where weed was dangerous
[02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:23.510]  because we're indoctrinated with that through dare
[02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:24.350]  and all this stuff.
[02:56:24.350 --> 02:56:25.310]  Yeah, well, back in the day,
[02:56:25.310 --> 02:56:27.990]  and they taught us that the Mexicans
[02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:30.470]  and the black jazz musicians would smoke weed
[02:56:30.470 --> 02:56:32.190]  and rape white bitches.
[02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:34.230]  You'd turn into a demon and rape the white women.
[02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:36.110]  What they fucking, reefer madness.
[02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:36.990]  It's what we're taught.
[02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:37.830]  Propaganda.
[02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:39.070]  And people, my grandparents,
[02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:42.190]  like they were smart enough to go, wait, that's bullshit.
[02:56:42.190 --> 02:56:43.590]  But they had friends that were like,
[02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:44.790]  your kids are smoking weed
[02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:46.590]  and we're never even going to be your friends again.
[02:56:46.590 --> 02:56:49.190]  Cause like my grandparents raised cool ass kids
[02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:50.150]  that were all potheads.
[02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:53.790]  Like I got three uncles and two aunts and my mom
[02:56:53.790 --> 02:56:55.990]  and they were all potheads until their adulthood life.
[02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:57.870]  And some of them still smoke.
[02:56:57.870 --> 02:56:58.830]  Some of them gave them it up just
[02:56:58.830 --> 02:57:00.070]  cause my mom can't smoke anymore.
[02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:02.470]  She gets so fucking stupid when she smokes weed.
[02:57:02.470 --> 02:57:05.150]  Yeah, but I mean, that's the thing with weed
[02:57:05.150 --> 02:57:08.350]  is there isn't that, me and my buddy, Paul,
[02:57:08.350 --> 02:57:09.630]  Paul Rosales.
[02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:10.470]  Shout out, Paul.
[02:57:10.470 --> 02:57:11.310]  What's up, bro?
[02:57:11.310 --> 02:57:12.150]  What's up, buddy?
[02:57:12.150 --> 02:57:13.230]  He's probably sitting at home. Wild cousins.
[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:14.230]  Yeah, wild cousins.
[02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:16.110]  Check out wild cousins.
[02:57:16.110 --> 02:57:18.230]  No, we were talking about it the other day
[02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:21.110]  and there's no, like with heroin,
[02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:23.270]  you get sick if you try to quit.
[02:57:23.270 --> 02:57:26.190]  And with meth and all these terrible drugs
[02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:28.790]  and, but marijuana for the longest time
[02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:30.830]  was in that same category.
[02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:32.950]  Like everybody thought that that's,
[02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:35.710]  oh, it's all the same, you know,
[02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:37.030]  but nobody talks about like,
[02:57:37.030 --> 02:57:39.750]  oh, I can go into a 7-Eleven at any time
[02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:45.790]  before 2 a.m. and go buy as much alcohol
[02:57:45.790 --> 02:57:47.190]  as I can fit in my car.
[02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:48.030]  Yep.
[02:57:48.030 --> 02:57:49.870]  And no, that's okay because the business-
[02:57:49.870 --> 02:57:53.430]  And take it to the state park and drink it on your boat.
[02:57:53.430 --> 02:57:54.270]  Yeah.
[02:57:54.270 --> 02:57:55.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:56.430]  You're completely allowed to.
[02:57:56.430 --> 02:57:57.270]  I mean, you could,
[02:57:58.270 --> 02:58:02.070]  I've been sober from alcohol for eight years
[02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.990]  and I had to quit.
[02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:05.270]  I had to quit because I had a real problem with it.
[02:58:05.270 --> 02:58:07.110]  Fortunately, I didn't get withdrawals
[02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:08.910]  when I decided to quit,
[02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:10.550]  but I do know people that do-
[02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:12.110]  Did you get shakes at all?
[02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.950]  I don't remember.
[02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:13.790]  It's been so long ago. So long ago.
[02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:15.470]  You're just over it and you'll never forget that.
[02:58:15.470 --> 02:58:18.190]  But I was literally 22 years old when I quit drinking.
[02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:19.030]  Wow.
[02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.870]  Yeah.
[02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:22.270]  Well, I mean, when you started at like 14,
[02:58:22.270 --> 02:58:24.110]  but that was the thing is you could get alcohol.
[02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:26.270]  Alcohol was, you could get it.
[02:58:26.390 --> 02:58:28.230]  It's just like cigarettes were back in the day.
[02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.070]  It was just on the shelf.
[02:58:29.070 --> 02:58:29.910]  It's just like weed was when it was illegal.
[02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:30.870]  You could get weed.
[02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:31.710]  Yeah.
[02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:32.870]  Never going to stop you from getting what you want.
[02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:33.710]  Yeah.
[02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:36.910]  But I don't remember the dare officer being like,
[02:58:36.910 --> 02:58:39.750]  dude, alcohol is the one you got to be watching.
[02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:41.150]  Oh, they put fucking,
[02:58:41.150 --> 02:58:42.630]  if you look at alcohol commercials,
[02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:45.190]  they make you think that if you drink Dos Equis,
[02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:47.510]  you are the most interesting man in the world.
[02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:49.750]  I don't always drink Dos Equis, but when I do,
[02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:51.550]  or I don't always drink alcohol, but when I do,
[02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:54.830]  I get two chicks, I get a boat, I get a cool ass dog.
[02:58:54.830 --> 02:58:56.150]  Someone throws a party.
[02:58:56.950 --> 02:58:58.510]  All this balloons happen and shit.
[02:58:58.510 --> 02:58:59.430]  I'm beautiful.
[02:58:59.430 --> 02:59:01.710]  Like fucking, just cause I drank some Dos Equis.
[02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:02.710]  Yeah.
[02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:03.990]  But on the opposite hand,
[02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:05.630]  like anytime that you're smoking weed,
[02:59:05.630 --> 02:59:07.270]  you're the stoner that sits on the couch
[02:59:07.270 --> 02:59:09.070]  and you're just so typecast as that.
[02:59:09.070 --> 02:59:10.990]  And I think that's such bullshit.
[02:59:10.990 --> 02:59:13.510]  So I wanted to give you a shout out, Jeff,
[02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:17.950]  for being a good representation of cannabis culture.
[02:59:17.950 --> 02:59:18.790]  Thank you, bro.
[02:59:18.790 --> 02:59:19.630]  That's cool.
[02:59:19.630 --> 02:59:23.030]  Hopefully some people on the other end of this podcast
[02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:24.590]  will agree with me.
[02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:27.070]  I'm absolutely positive they do
[02:59:27.070 --> 02:59:29.790]  because after I posted episode 50,
[02:59:29.790 --> 02:59:33.550]  my email and social media feeds have exploded
[02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:36.430]  with people saying, thank you for this show.
[02:59:36.430 --> 02:59:38.830]  Dude, you guys, you overwhelmed me.
[02:59:38.830 --> 02:59:40.070]  You made me like,
[02:59:40.070 --> 02:59:41.990]  I don't even know, there's a feeling in my heart.
[02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:43.110]  I don't even know what to call it,
[02:59:43.110 --> 02:59:45.030]  but there's this big bright white light
[02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:46.870]  that goes around my chest area when I think about it.
[02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:48.270]  And my friends in this room can see it in me
[02:59:48.270 --> 02:59:49.230]  when I'm talking about it right now,
[02:59:49.230 --> 02:59:50.230]  cause I'm like wiggling.
[02:59:50.230 --> 02:59:51.070]  You do get excited.
[02:59:51.070 --> 02:59:52.950]  To have that many people email me and go,
[02:59:52.950 --> 02:59:55.150]  dude, we're fucking proud of you and your show is awesome.
[02:59:55.150 --> 02:59:57.350]  Like I'm overwhelmed and super excited.
[02:59:57.350 --> 02:59:59.230]  Yeah, congratulations on 50, by the way.
[02:59:59.230 --> 03:00:00.390]  I know what's this, 51?
[03:00:00.390 --> 03:00:01.230]  51, yeah.
[03:00:01.230 --> 03:00:02.070]  51.
[03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:03.390]  And I got Angela on 51.
[03:00:03.390 --> 03:00:05.070]  She said she never wanted to be on the podcast.
[03:00:05.070 --> 03:00:05.910]  Yeah.
[03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:06.750]  You tricked me.
[03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:08.430]  I totally tricked you.
[03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:10.510]  I bluttered you with weed.
[03:00:11.670 --> 03:00:13.470]  Fucking hippies, we're all the same.
[03:00:15.790 --> 03:00:16.630]  Yeah.
[03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:17.870]  I wanted you to be here when I told the story
[03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:21.230]  about us not being able to finish our sexual escapade
[03:00:21.230 --> 03:00:22.710]  because I wanted to be respectful about it
[03:00:23.470 --> 03:00:24.670]  and I would have to play the episode for you
[03:00:24.670 --> 03:00:26.590]  and let you edit out anything you didn't like anyway.
[03:00:26.590 --> 03:00:29.510]  So you kept us on track and kept it nice.
[03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:31.470]  So I'm glad you came for that part.
[03:00:31.470 --> 03:00:32.310]  How do you-
[03:00:32.310 --> 03:00:33.630]  Do you like-
[03:00:33.630 --> 03:00:35.190]  It's pun intended.
[03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:36.030]  How's the store?
[03:00:36.030 --> 03:00:37.230]  Oh, I didn't hear.
[03:00:37.230 --> 03:00:39.190]  That's why I love her.
[03:00:39.190 --> 03:00:40.950]  How's the store treating you?
[03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:42.270]  Do you like working there?
[03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:45.590]  Sorry, I was thinking of it.
[03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:46.830]  Yeah, I like it.
[03:00:46.830 --> 03:00:48.670]  She can't say she fucking hates it on the podcast.
[03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:51.950]  No, no, I really like working there.
[03:00:51.990 --> 03:00:53.950]  Recreational is definitely a lot different
[03:00:53.950 --> 03:00:55.990]  than working medical.
[03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:59.750]  The novelty definitely wears off kind of quickly
[03:00:59.750 --> 03:01:02.070]  and then it just becomes a job a little bit,
[03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:05.350]  but it's still when people come in for the first time
[03:01:05.350 --> 03:01:08.670]  and they're really excited, that makes it all worth it.
[03:01:08.670 --> 03:01:10.150]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:11.830]  I don't, I'm-
[03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:12.750]  I can't really complain.
[03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:13.950]  I sell weed all day for a living.
[03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:16.150]  I don't know if that chunk came from previous meals
[03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:17.190]  or the drink I just took,
[03:01:17.190 --> 03:01:19.510]  but yeah, I wish I wouldn't have found that.
[03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:21.110]  I go hang out at the spot sometimes.
[03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:22.750]  I'll show up with food or sometimes a boss
[03:01:22.750 --> 03:01:24.950]  will just have random questions and I'll pop in
[03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:26.870]  and I don't want to leave when I get there
[03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:28.150]  because it's fun.
[03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:29.190]  Everyone's just hanging out,
[03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:30.830]  selling weed and having a good time.
[03:01:30.830 --> 03:01:31.830]  Oh, it's a nice place.
[03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:33.350]  They're sweeping and cleaning and shit,
[03:01:33.350 --> 03:01:34.630]  but I mean, you can bullshit with me
[03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:35.870]  while you're sweeping and cleaning
[03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:36.830]  and it's fun there.
[03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:37.870]  It's a good atmosphere.
[03:01:37.870 --> 03:01:39.750]  Yeah, and the crew's all like family too.
[03:01:39.750 --> 03:01:41.190]  We all get along and-
[03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:42.110]  A little too well.
[03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:43.470]  Yeah, a little too well.
[03:01:43.470 --> 03:01:47.670]  We're silly as shit and we're always goofing around.
[03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:48.630]  I hope everyone's listening.
[03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:50.150]  I look forward to getting in there.
[03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.990]  Yeah.
[03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:53.310]  I totally took over your answer,
[03:01:53.310 --> 03:01:54.510]  but I look forward to getting in there
[03:01:54.510 --> 03:01:56.110]  because it looks so much fun.
[03:01:56.110 --> 03:01:58.870]  Do you have a favorite product from there?
[03:01:58.870 --> 03:02:02.750]  Is there something that you would recommend as a-
[03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:04.790]  Oh yeah, that stuff's awesome.
[03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:07.030]  The apothecary lotion.
[03:02:07.030 --> 03:02:09.350]  I make Jeff rub me with that all the time
[03:02:09.350 --> 03:02:11.630]  because my shoulders are always killing me
[03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:14.430]  and that stuff is the shit, the extra strength kind.
[03:02:14.430 --> 03:02:15.510]  I was skeptical of it.
[03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:16.870]  I didn't believe it would work.
[03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:19.470]  And then one time I rubbed her down with it
[03:02:19.470 --> 03:02:21.550]  and it made my hands all fluffy.
[03:02:21.550 --> 03:02:22.390]  Nice.
[03:02:23.350 --> 03:02:25.510]  Yeah, it definitely makes a difference.
[03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:27.710]  Shout out to Apothecana, the Grammy Gatsby.
[03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:30.030]  So that's something.
[03:02:30.030 --> 03:02:31.590]  See, that's just stuff that it's like,
[03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:32.590]  so it's a lotion?
[03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:33.430]  Yeah, it's a lotion.
[03:02:33.430 --> 03:02:34.270]  Yeah, it's a lotion.
[03:02:34.270 --> 03:02:35.110]  It's a topical.
[03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.950]  It doesn't get you high,
[03:02:35.950 --> 03:02:38.110]  but it definitely is really relaxing
[03:02:38.110 --> 03:02:39.870]  for your muscles and everything.
[03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:42.470]  And I definitely deal with a lot of neck and back pain
[03:02:42.470 --> 03:02:43.750]  and that helps a lot.
[03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:45.590]  Right on.
[03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:48.230]  I put it on my knee and it helps my bum knee a little bit.
[03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:49.070]  It makes it not hurt.
[03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:50.510]  When it gets cold, my knee hurts
[03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:51.350]  and I rub some of that on there
[03:02:51.350 --> 03:02:52.510]  and it won't hurt no more.
[03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:53.350]  Anymore?
[03:02:53.350 --> 03:02:54.430]  I said no more.
[03:02:54.430 --> 03:02:56.190]  Can you pick that up on the recreational side
[03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:57.750]  as well as the medicinal side?
[03:02:57.750 --> 03:02:58.910]  Yes, you can.
[03:02:58.910 --> 03:02:59.950]  See?
[03:02:59.950 --> 03:03:01.550]  These are the questions that need answering.
[03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:02.710]  This is why we brought Clint.
[03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:03.550]  Yeah.
[03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:04.390]  Awesome.
[03:03:04.390 --> 03:03:05.230]  Good question.
[03:03:05.230 --> 03:03:06.070]  Let's see how long we've gone.
[03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.910]  I need to look and see how long we're doing.
[03:03:06.910 --> 03:03:07.750]  We're just chatting here.
[03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:08.590]  I'm not even paying attention.
[03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:09.430]  49 minutes.
[03:03:09.430 --> 03:03:10.270]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[03:03:10.270 --> 03:03:11.110]  I had some news articles.
[03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:13.270]  I think that'll be episode 52.
[03:03:13.270 --> 03:03:14.870]  We'll just save those.
[03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:17.230]  There's no need to get into the bunch of news.
[03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:21.470]  My news is that February 21st,
[03:03:21.470 --> 03:03:24.710]  we're doing a benefit show at the Downtown Bar
[03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:25.910]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:28.430]  I'm not sure if there's a cover.
[03:03:28.430 --> 03:03:29.390]  I'm sure there is a cover,
[03:03:29.390 --> 03:03:30.990]  but I don't remember what it is.
[03:03:30.990 --> 03:03:32.150]  But I'm on early.
[03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:35.030]  I'm on at like three o'clock in the afternoon.
[03:03:35.910 --> 03:03:36.990]  We do comedy first
[03:03:36.990 --> 03:03:39.190]  and then they're gonna do bands after that.
[03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:41.350]  So you pay maybe five bucks.
[03:03:41.350 --> 03:03:45.550]  It's a benefit show, February 21st.
[03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:47.070]  Who are we benefiting?
[03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:48.910]  That is for Pops.
[03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:49.990]  Oh, for Pops?
[03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.830]  Yeah.
[03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:51.670]  Cool, what's up?
[03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:53.030]  Pops benefits you, bro.
[03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:54.470]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:03:54.470 --> 03:03:57.030]  will try to figure out some way to contribute to that.
[03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:59.550]  It's iRiginetics and Team iRi will have to do something
[03:03:59.550 --> 03:04:01.510]  because dude, Pops is...
[03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:05.630]  I used to grow specific CBD medicine for Pops
[03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:06.550]  back in the day.
[03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:09.590]  I just gotta grab my phone real quick.
[03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:10.430]  Clint's gonna grab his phone.
[03:04:10.430 --> 03:04:12.390]  I think he's got a note in there or something.
[03:04:12.390 --> 03:04:14.190]  He's got some notes.
[03:04:14.190 --> 03:04:16.310]  So February 21st in Pueblo, Colorado,
[03:04:16.350 --> 03:04:17.190]  downtown bar.
[03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:18.190]  There are gonna be a lot of comedians.
[03:04:18.190 --> 03:04:19.430]  I think I've seen something about this,
[03:04:19.430 --> 03:04:21.350]  but I see so many things on Facebook
[03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:23.390]  that my brain doesn't absorb all of them.
[03:04:24.270 --> 03:04:26.110]  Downtown bar, there's gonna be a lot of good music.
[03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:27.110]  There'll be a lot of good comedians.
[03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:28.190]  Get down there, support Pops.
[03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:30.150]  Pops has been a staple of the Pueblo community
[03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:31.670]  for a long time.
[03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:32.510]  If you're from Pueblo
[03:04:32.510 --> 03:04:34.910]  and you've ever been to any drinking establishment
[03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:36.470]  and you've had to deal with that old guy outside
[03:04:36.470 --> 03:04:38.830]  with the grovelly voice that checks your ID,
[03:04:38.830 --> 03:04:40.150]  let me see your ID.
[03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:41.790]  That's Pops.
[03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:42.630]  That's Pops.
[03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:43.470]  You know Pops.
[03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:46.750]  Help somebody to not kick your ass
[03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:48.350]  at one point in your life if you've been to the bar.
[03:04:48.350 --> 03:04:50.510]  Pops has been the bouncer and the security guard.
[03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:51.750]  And there's always that one asshole in the bar
[03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:53.470]  that wants to fight and Pops will protect you.
[03:04:53.470 --> 03:04:55.150]  So shout out to Pops.
[03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:56.870]  He had lung cancer.
[03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:58.910]  So we need some help for that, dude.
[03:04:58.910 --> 03:04:59.750]  Clint, get to your note
[03:04:59.750 --> 03:05:01.710]  because I'm rambling about Pops for a long time now.
[03:05:01.710 --> 03:05:02.550]  Yeah, sorry.
[03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:05.790]  All right, so it is February 21st
[03:05:05.790 --> 03:05:08.670]  at the downtown bar, music and comedy.
[03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:12.750]  And the show starts at like two.
[03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:13.630]  Two p.m.
[03:05:13.630 --> 03:05:15.790]  And I'm gonna be on maybe like three o'clock
[03:05:15.790 --> 03:05:17.990]  but it's the comedians.
[03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:19.270]  I'm just gonna talk about the comedians
[03:05:19.270 --> 03:05:20.950]  because there's so many guys coming down.
[03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:22.030]  Let's hear them.
[03:05:22.030 --> 03:05:22.950]  Dan Rainey.
[03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:23.790]  Nice.
[03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:25.350]  Myself, Paul Rosales.
[03:05:25.350 --> 03:05:26.190]  Cool.
[03:05:26.190 --> 03:05:27.030]  Matt Chapman.
[03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.850]  What up, Matty?
[03:05:27.850 --> 03:05:28.910]  John Brown.
[03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:29.750]  What's up, John Brown?
[03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:31.350]  Wade Ridley, Charlie McMullen.
[03:05:31.350 --> 03:05:34.750]  I can't shout them all out if you're going that fast.
[03:05:34.750 --> 03:05:35.590]  Well, they're all there.
[03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:36.430]  I'm sorry.
[03:05:36.430 --> 03:05:38.070]  You said go fast.
[03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:40.110]  But that's like a really good group.
[03:05:40.110 --> 03:05:41.270]  That is a good, very good group.
[03:05:41.270 --> 03:05:42.950]  A lot of funny guys and I'll be on.
[03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:44.990]  So I mean, you can even get a smoke break.
[03:05:44.990 --> 03:05:46.790]  Look at all the funny guys you get to play with.
[03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:48.510]  That means that you're actually funny.
[03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:49.350]  No, it's-
[03:05:49.350 --> 03:05:50.950]  All those dudes are quality comedians.
[03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:52.950]  Every one of those guys has funny shit.
[03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:53.790]  Yeah.
[03:05:53.790 --> 03:05:55.070]  None of those guys are hacks.
[03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:56.550]  I have made a-
[03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:57.390]  That's my favorite thing
[03:05:57.390 --> 03:05:58.230]  about Southern Colorado comedy.
[03:05:58.230 --> 03:05:59.350]  I've made a joke on Facebook
[03:05:59.350 --> 03:06:00.790]  about a local comedian being a hack
[03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:01.910]  and every comedian in Pueblo
[03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:03.350]  thought I was talking about them.
[03:06:03.350 --> 03:06:04.190]  We get so sad.
[03:06:04.190 --> 03:06:06.790]  The people that you just listed are not the hacks.
[03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:07.630]  No.
[03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:08.870]  Those people tell jokes they wrote.
[03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:10.550]  No, no, that's the thing.
[03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:11.630]  I hope they all heard that.
[03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:14.750]  Southern Colorado comedy is really pushing forward
[03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:16.430]  with our own sense of humor.
[03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:18.990]  You might not like me,
[03:06:18.990 --> 03:06:20.990]  but you're gonna like one of the guys on that
[03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:23.030]  or you're gonna like one of the people on that.
[03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:24.030]  We've got a lot of friends.
[03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:25.110]  We're all friends.
[03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:29.310]  And that's my favorite thing about the comedy culture
[03:06:29.310 --> 03:06:31.390]  is it is kind of like a weed culture.
[03:06:31.390 --> 03:06:32.910]  I mean, they go hand in hand almost.
[03:06:32.910 --> 03:06:34.910]  It's because everybody knows everybody.
[03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:35.750]  Yeah.
[03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:37.150]  We went up to that show.
[03:06:37.150 --> 03:06:38.790]  You knew people that knew people.
[03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:39.630]  There was people,
[03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:41.350]  our waitress was like, do you know this person?
[03:06:41.350 --> 03:06:43.310]  Nah, I kind of know this person though.
[03:06:43.310 --> 03:06:44.910]  And they know that person.
[03:06:44.910 --> 03:06:46.910]  It's just a community.
[03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:48.190]  And so it was great.
[03:06:48.190 --> 03:06:50.510]  That Chris Sharpentier, I told him,
[03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:52.390]  I was like, dude, we need to get you down to Pueblo
[03:06:52.390 --> 03:06:54.190]  because he had been scheduled down once,
[03:06:54.190 --> 03:06:56.070]  but he couldn't make it that night.
[03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:57.630]  But that was one of my favorite shows.
[03:06:57.630 --> 03:06:59.830]  That was David Borey came down with Sam Talent
[03:06:59.830 --> 03:07:00.670]  and it was great.
[03:07:00.670 --> 03:07:01.630]  And Byron Graham.
[03:07:01.630 --> 03:07:04.470]  So shout out to everybody that comes down to Pueblo.
[03:07:04.470 --> 03:07:06.270]  We're really trying to work hard.
[03:07:07.110 --> 03:07:09.510]  Every second and fourth Thursday,
[03:07:09.510 --> 03:07:12.470]  we're at the Rainbow Bar on Santa Fe doing an open mic,
[03:07:13.390 --> 03:07:14.430]  trying to promote that.
[03:07:14.430 --> 03:07:17.430]  We did one this last week and it's so fun.
[03:07:17.430 --> 03:07:19.830]  It's such a great place for comedy.
[03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:22.390]  So I hope everybody can come out and check it out.
[03:07:22.390 --> 03:07:23.670]  Support local comedy, you guys.
[03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:24.550]  Even if you're not in Pueblo,
[03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:25.590]  there's comedy where you are.
[03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:26.990]  And if you're an aspiring comedian,
[03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:28.430]  start the scene, do it.
[03:07:28.430 --> 03:07:29.270]  That's right.
[03:07:29.270 --> 03:07:30.550]  All it takes is you to go stand somewhere
[03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:33.350]  and tell some jokes and invite some friends to come listen.
[03:07:33.350 --> 03:07:34.550]  Get four or five people,
[03:07:34.590 --> 03:07:37.190]  make a little comedy showcase at the bar every slow night.
[03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:38.670]  Wednesday nights are good for it.
[03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:39.510]  The bar is dead.
[03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:40.350]  Wednesdays, Thursdays.
[03:07:40.350 --> 03:07:41.430]  I mean, we're on on Thursdays
[03:07:41.430 --> 03:07:42.470]  because we don't want to compete
[03:07:42.470 --> 03:07:44.470]  with the downtown bar every Wednesday.
[03:07:45.470 --> 03:07:47.790]  But we do the second and third
[03:07:47.790 --> 03:07:49.990]  or the second and fourth Thursday,
[03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:51.190]  we're going to be at the Rainbow Bar.
[03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:53.110]  And I just, I'm hoping people can come out.
[03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:54.150]  It's a free show.
[03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:55.390]  Free show.
[03:07:55.390 --> 03:07:56.230]  Super fun.
[03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:57.830]  And free fun.
[03:07:57.830 --> 03:08:00.350]  The guys I'm working with are so funny.
[03:08:00.350 --> 03:08:01.190]  It's ridiculous.
[03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:02.670]  Super free fun comedy night.
[03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:04.430]  It just became some Asian commercial.
[03:08:05.310 --> 03:08:07.150]  Super free fun comedy night.
[03:08:07.150 --> 03:08:08.470]  All right.
[03:08:08.470 --> 03:08:09.950]  And it got racist.
[03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:13.230]  It didn't, it lasted an hour without that.
[03:08:13.230 --> 03:08:15.110]  For comedians, that's not bad, you know?
[03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:16.630]  All right, so we're back.
[03:08:18.310 --> 03:08:19.150]  I don't know.
[03:08:19.150 --> 03:08:19.990]  I'm not going to edit that.
[03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.990]  We're good.
[03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:23.110]  It felt, you said how comedians are friends.
[03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:25.070]  It felt like once we hung out with Ari
[03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:26.270]  for just a couple of seconds,
[03:08:26.270 --> 03:08:28.310]  it just seemed like just some other dude.
[03:08:28.310 --> 03:08:29.150]  Oh yeah.
[03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:30.710]  Yeah, we smoked out with Ari in the alley
[03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:32.070]  and it didn't even seem like
[03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:33.310]  we're smoking with a celebrity.
[03:08:33.310 --> 03:08:34.510]  He just smoked weed and he's like,
[03:08:34.510 --> 03:08:35.990]  all right guys, I gotta go.
[03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:38.030]  It had some phone texting going on.
[03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:39.590]  I think he had some booty call to go 10-2
[03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:40.430]  and he was out.
[03:08:40.430 --> 03:08:41.630]  Yeah, and he was just a nice guy.
[03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:43.310]  I mean, there was literally a couple minutes
[03:08:43.310 --> 03:08:45.070]  there where nobody was talking
[03:08:45.070 --> 03:08:48.670]  and everybody gets so amped around like celebrities.
[03:08:48.670 --> 03:08:51.190]  But I really do feel like Ari Shafir is a celebrity.
[03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:53.510]  He's put in so much work to get to where he's at
[03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:55.110]  and his special was so good.
[03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:57.190]  And his special just came out.
[03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:58.390]  So, you know, you would have thought like
[03:08:58.390 --> 03:09:00.790]  all these guys that listen to his podcast
[03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:01.830]  would have been all up on his nuts,
[03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:02.910]  but everybody's just kind of like,
[03:09:02.910 --> 03:09:05.390]  yeah, you're just a guy.
[03:09:05.390 --> 03:09:06.790]  And that's how he acts.
[03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:08.030]  He has a sweet sweater on.
[03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:09.350]  He didn't like hearing about,
[03:09:09.350 --> 03:09:10.510]  I listen to your show, man, it's great.
[03:09:10.510 --> 03:09:11.550]  Episode whatever was awesome.
[03:09:11.550 --> 03:09:12.390]  He's like, cool, thanks.
[03:09:12.390 --> 03:09:13.310]  Let's talk about weed.
[03:09:13.310 --> 03:09:14.150]  Yeah.
[03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:15.550]  He's just fucking, I don't want to talk about me anymore.
[03:09:15.550 --> 03:09:16.390]  Like it was kind of neat.
[03:09:16.390 --> 03:09:17.230]  Like he didn't care.
[03:09:17.230 --> 03:09:18.510]  He's like, I'm just a dude, man.
[03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:20.470]  Well, yeah, and then I did too.
[03:09:20.470 --> 03:09:22.830]  Cause I told him that if you get a chance,
[03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:25.070]  if you're going to listen to that Skeptic Tank,
[03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:27.550]  was it 202 with Ali Sadiq?
[03:09:27.550 --> 03:09:29.150]  Yeah, yeah, 202 I think.
[03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:30.870]  Oh, that was such a good episode.
[03:09:31.390 --> 03:09:32.230]  Check that one out.
[03:09:32.230 --> 03:09:33.110]  If you're going to listen to the one,
[03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.950]  yeah, if you're going to listen to the
[03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:35.070]  Ari Shafir Skeptic Tank,
[03:09:35.070 --> 03:09:37.670]  listen to the episode that is titled Paid Regular.
[03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:38.950]  Let's start with that one.
[03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:40.030]  I think that's one of the best.
[03:09:40.030 --> 03:09:41.510]  I think that's episode 201.
[03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:42.350]  Sweet.
[03:09:42.350 --> 03:09:44.110]  Maybe 200, but.
[03:09:44.110 --> 03:09:46.750]  200 was a couple of his comedy buddies.
[03:09:46.750 --> 03:09:48.150]  Yeah, that was really funny too though.
[03:09:48.150 --> 03:09:48.990]  Danish and whatever.
[03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:50.830]  All right, sorry to tell you to go listen to something else.
[03:09:50.830 --> 03:09:53.670]  Listen to Broke From Your Heart podcast as well.
[03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:55.070]  We got to support other people.
[03:09:55.070 --> 03:09:57.110]  Miss Angela, you got any things you want to say
[03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:59.390]  to the world before we wrap up the show here?
[03:10:00.350 --> 03:10:01.190]  Um, no.
[03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:03.270]  I don't have much to say.
[03:10:03.270 --> 03:10:04.750]  You don't have like an extravagant message
[03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:06.350]  of peace and love for everybody?
[03:10:07.350 --> 03:10:11.630]  Insert extravagant message of peace and love here.
[03:10:11.630 --> 03:10:13.350]  And if you're going to try to insert anything,
[03:10:13.350 --> 03:10:14.990]  don't smoke too much CBD medicine.
[03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.830]  Right.
[03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:17.750]  It takes way too long.
[03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:19.030]  Thanks for letting me embarrass you on the show.

[03:10:30.390 --> 03:10:31.870]  Just at the end.
[03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:33.190]  Just the tip.
[03:10:33.190 --> 03:10:34.190]  I'm going to do this part.

[03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:17.510]  That was weird.
[03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:18.350]  I heard something in my earphones.
[03:11:18.350 --> 03:11:19.190]  I don't know what it was.
[03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:20.030]  I didn't hear it, man.
[03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:20.870]  Okay, then.
[03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:22.670]  Wasn't that a joke last night too, though?
[03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:26.030]  Ari says that he hears shit from too many drugs.
[03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:27.230]  Oh God, that was so fun.
[03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.910]  Maybe that's what's going on.
