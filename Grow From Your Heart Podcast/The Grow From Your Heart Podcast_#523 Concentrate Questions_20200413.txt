[00:52.320 --> 00:58.320]  podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange Skittles
[00:58.320 --> 01:06.720]  Live Batter from Apothecary Farms. On the package, it says the potency is 66.7% THC and 77.2%
[01:07.440 --> 01:13.360]  total cannabinoids. This concentrate smells disgustingly delicious. It is almost
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.800]  overwhelmingly citrusy. There's a sweetness, there's a funkiness to it. Orange Skittles
[01:18.800 --> 01:23.920]  describes it perfectly. I really love the flavor. It's got a really nice buzz. It lingers on the
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.400]  tongue for a really long time. So if you take a nice dab, and if you don't take a drink, it'll
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.520]  just hang out on your mouth and you get that nice orangey, citrusy, lemon kind of a flavor to it.
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.760]  It really hangs out for a while. Then the buzz is really like straight to the face,
[01:37.760 --> 01:41.600]  straight to the brain. It's got me a little bit goofy, a little bit forgetful, but I'm kind of
[01:41.600 --> 01:47.280]  like that anyway. So I'm good at this. I'm going to be okay. This will be great podcast concentrates.
[01:47.280 --> 01:53.760]  So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the Orange Skittles Live Batter.
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do have an excellent show planned for you. Before we get to the main topic,
[01:58.640 --> 02:04.240]  let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show on Patreon. We're going to roll
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.640]  up some digital joints. We're going to pack up some virtual dabs. We're going to pass over some
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.280]  JPEG bong rips. We're going to keep everybody safe and healthy during this weird quarantine
[02:13.280 --> 02:18.000]  and social distancing time. If you're listening to this in the future, man, read about the
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  quarantine and the social distancing in 2020. It was fucking crazy. We're in the middle of it now.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.840]  Anyway, we're going to stay safe. We're going to keep the social distancing in effect.
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.400]  We're going to pass over some digital dabs, some virtual bong rips. We're going to stay safe.
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.760]  Let's start off by rolling up a big fat digital joint, lighting it up digitally and passing it
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.440]  over to my buddy Brett C. Then let's pack up a big fat fresh bong load. Send that one over to my
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.080]  buddy Jacob W. Then we're going to roll a big fat digital blunt. We're going to light that one up
[02:48.080 --> 02:55.520]  for my buddy Mason 662. Then let's, how about we take a big fat dab? Let's get way too big of a dab
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.320]  and heat up that nail and get that one going for my buddy Tobes McLovin. Let's fill up one of those
[03:00.320 --> 03:06.880]  ridiculous vaporizer bags and pass that over to my buddy Captain Mojo. Let's bake a batch of edibles
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.320]  that are surprisingly potent and send a big package of those over to my buddy Willie's armpit.
[03:12.320 --> 03:17.760]  Let's just roll up a big Bob Marley size joint of the stinkiest herb you have ever smoked. Let's
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.320]  light that up and pass it over to my buddy Steve Smith. Big shout out to Steve Smith for having the
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.680]  same name as one of my favorite drummers. Let's also roll up a big fat joint. Let's sprinkle some
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.760]  keef down the middle of this joint. Maybe put some shatter on the outside of it. Let's wrap a snake
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.920]  of shatter right around the outside of the joint. Be careful. It's going to burn crazy. Don't burn
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.000]  yourself. We're going to light that fucker up and pass that over to Tommy. Big shout out to my buddy
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.960]  Tommy. How about my buddy Godfather Kush? Bro, I have got the biggest dab of the freshest rosin for
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.040]  you. Big shout out to my buddy Godfather Kush for supporting the show. I've also got a big fat dab of
[03:53.040 --> 04:01.040]  some freshly pressed blue raspberry truffle rosin for my buddy Baked PWN. And last but certainly not
[04:01.040 --> 04:07.760]  least, let's bake up some super potent psychedelic high blueberry muffins and send those out to my
[04:07.760 --> 04:14.400]  buddy Stabby McMotherfuckingstabwood. Big thanks. Big shout out to everybody who has continued to
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.720]  support the show on Patreon. If you would like to learn how to support the show, all you have to do
[04:18.720 --> 04:26.720]  is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. I did include a link in the show notes
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.080]  to make it easy for all of my stoned friends. All right, everybody, thank you for having fun with me
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.360]  with the digital dabs and digital bong rips and virtual blunts. We've got to stay positive in this
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.760]  weird time. I know people are struggling. I know things are weird for everybody. I am trying to
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.840]  shed some light on things and keep it positive. So I've got a really fun message to read on this
[04:47.840 --> 04:55.200]  episode of the show. I recently posted a six-year celebration podcast. We recently celebrated our
[04:55.200 --> 05:03.120]  sixth year in action. That was episode 518. That episode got a tremendous amount of response. I got
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.880]  a lot of YouTube comments. I got a lot of iTunes Apple podcast comments. I got a lot of Stitcher
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.320]  reaction. I got a ton of emails. What I'm trying to say is a lot of people responded to that,
[05:14.320 --> 05:20.240]  and I appreciate and love the interaction. In this episode, I'm going to read what was my
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.560]  favorite comment in the entire YouTube comment feed for that episode. This comment came from
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.840]  my friend who calls himself Fumidor and the flavors on YouTube. What's up, Fumidor? Big
[05:31.840 --> 05:37.280]  respect. Thanks for hanging out. Fumidor is also a part of the Embracing Organics podcast. We do a
[05:37.280 --> 05:43.040]  live show every Thursday on YouTube. The show starts at 7 p.m. Mountain Time. I don't know
[05:43.040 --> 05:47.680]  what time zone you are in. I know that it's mountain time for me and that it is seven o'clock.
[05:47.680 --> 05:52.080]  You've got to adjust your clocks accordingly. You can find the show on YouTube. All of the
[05:52.080 --> 05:58.560]  previous episodes are still there. Again, it is called Embracing Organics. My buddy Fumidor joins
[05:58.560 --> 06:03.840]  us on that show. He is also on a few other shows. He is part of the Portland Cannabis
[06:03.840 --> 06:09.360]  Tasting Society. He is a big cannabis spokesperson in the Pacific Northwest area.
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.600]  I think he's a great dude. I think he's a very well-spoken dude. He's always a very polite young
[06:13.600 --> 06:17.840]  man, which is hard to find these days. A lot of people just forgot all about manners and rules.
[06:18.480 --> 06:24.640]  I really respect Fumidor. He asked a great question on my YouTube channel. The question
[06:24.640 --> 06:31.760]  goes a lot like this. It says, Rostachef, congrats on six years. Thank you, bro. I appreciate that.
[06:31.760 --> 06:36.400]  It goes on to say, now, if you had to put all of the dabs together and weigh them,
[06:36.400 --> 06:43.520]  how much would it be? Also, how long would it take you to dab that pile in one go?
[06:43.520 --> 06:46.800]  If you listen to the podcast, you know that at the beginning of every episode,
[06:46.800 --> 06:51.040]  I take a couple of dabs. It is kind of a tradition. I sit down, get the podcast gear
[06:51.040 --> 06:55.360]  lined up, I get my notes together. Then a couple of minutes before I record, I like to take a
[06:55.360 --> 07:00.080]  couple of dabs and get my brain moving or sometimes stop it from moving. It depends on what I'm
[07:00.080 --> 07:04.560]  smoking and where I start off. If you listen, you know it's become a tradition that I do start the
[07:04.560 --> 07:10.320]  show by talking about what I'm smoking. The question is, in six years of podcasting,
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.360]  if you put all of the dabs together, how much would it weigh? Then the second question is,
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.720]  how long would it take to smoke it all in one go? I thought this was a funny and interesting
[07:20.720 --> 07:27.040]  question, so I decided to tackle this with some stoner math. When I read this, there were 520
[07:27.040 --> 07:34.080]  episodes, so my math goes a little bit like this. There are approximately 520 episodes to date.
[07:34.080 --> 07:42.080]  I take a quarter to a half gram dab to start each episode. That makes approximately 260 grams if I
[07:42.080 --> 07:48.480]  take one or two dabs before each show. Then I said, that is unlikely because I probably take
[07:48.480 --> 07:58.320]  closer to two or four dabs, so it's possibly up to 520 grams of pre-show dabs. Approximately 520
[07:58.320 --> 08:05.040]  grams have been dabbed just before the show. Then I added onto that. There's more. It says,
[08:05.040 --> 08:12.400]  I've had Dab and Granny, Maddie and Spence, the Terpex Crew, Sloppy, Barefoot, and a host of other
[08:12.400 --> 08:18.640]  heavy dabbers on the show who have all helped increase our consumption. They probably smoked
[08:18.640 --> 08:24.560]  another full pound during the pre-show and on-air smoke sessions. Think about all of the people who
[08:24.560 --> 08:30.960]  have joined me on the show. Mike, Jesse, Sean, Barefoot Grower, Chris and Lindsey used to be on
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.840]  the show all the time. Their friend Shannon came on the show a couple of times. Sloppy has been
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.720]  here. Joe has been here. We've had a garden of Weeden Crew comes and just smokes down. We've
[08:40.720 --> 08:45.040]  had a gang of people. Clint is the only one that doesn't smoke dabs. Everybody that's been on the
[08:45.040 --> 08:51.280]  show, I think, has come and taken a dab on the show. Maybe Becca didn't take a dab from Elevate
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.680]  now that I think about it. She doesn't dab, but there were very few people that did not take dabs
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.480]  while they were on the show. So I have probably smoked 520 grams of pre-show dabs myself. Then
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.360]  I'm going to guess that the crew, the gang, has smoked at least another pound on their own.
[09:08.160 --> 09:14.480]  So my reply was my short answer is one pound to myself and two pounds total. That would make sense
[09:14.480 --> 09:20.000]  to me without sounding like I'm exaggerating or trying to over-inflate it. And that is just the
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.080]  pre-show dabs. That's when we all sit down and say, are you ready to do a show? And everybody
[09:24.080 --> 09:27.840]  gets here and we congregate at the table. And then we start pulling out the rig and the torch,
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.600]  and we all have a little smoke session. And then we get a little bit silly, and there's always a
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.080]  moment of silence. This, oh, fuck, we all just got way high. And then that's when I've got to go,
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.800]  you guys ready to record? And then everybody goes, oh, shit, we got to do this. So that is just our
[09:40.800 --> 09:47.040]  pre-show and on-air dabs. I'm going to say a pound for me and then another pound for all of the crew,
[09:47.040 --> 09:52.640]  because I've been here for every episode. If I had to guess, I've probably only had a guest on
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.400]  probably a quarter to a third of every episode. And most of those were probably Mike. And he
[09:58.400 --> 10:04.480]  doesn't take big enough dabs or enough dabs to make too much of a dent in the concentrate pile.
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.680]  I'm sure over 520 episodes, if he was on a quarter of them, that's a little over 100 episodes,
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.000]  probably take a 0.2 dab. That would add up eventually. He's probably smoked a couple
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.800]  grams on the show, but not as significant as myself. Anyway, I'm rambling. I thought that
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.480]  was a really fun and entertaining question. Big shout out to my buddy, Fumidor and the Flavors on
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.560]  the YouTube. I think he's fumidorchibidor on Instagram and be sure to give him a follow and
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.640]  check us out on the Embracing Organics podcast live every Thursday on the YouTube channel.
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.920]  There was a follow-up to this question. It said, how long would it take to smoke all of this over
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.880]  again in one go? That is a ridiculous question. Imagine smoking one to two pounds of concentrates
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.960]  in one go. What is considered one go? So I did reply to that. I said, how many naps do I get
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.160]  to take in this one go? Because that is a lot of dabs. And then I said, honestly, I think my throat
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.120]  would burn out before I get too high to function. I don't think my lungs and my throat would be
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.520]  interested in dabbing about a quarter pound into that. We would all be looking at each other like,
[11:09.520 --> 11:14.240]  let's just give up and go eat something. I think after that many concentrates and that many dabs,
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.240]  everybody would just want a mango smoothie or something nice on the throat that makes your
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.120]  throat feel better. Your throat's going to hurt after that many dabs. So I would probably burn
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.000]  out my lungs and my body before my brain got too high to function. But I'm down to give it a try.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.040]  If you want to bring me two pounds of concentrates and set them here on the table, you can smoke one
[11:33.040 --> 11:37.840]  and I'll smoke one. And we can see how far into these pounds of concentrates we can get before
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.360]  we just decide to give up and go get food. It sounds like a good time. I do continue my comment.
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.800]  I think I said, if I smoke my one pound portion by myself, I could comfortably smoke one to two
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.840]  grams per day. If it was a challenge, I could smoke three to seven grams a day without over
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.880]  medicating. If I had to conserve, one gram per day is sufficient. So right now when we're
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.720]  quarantined, I'm trying to stay on one gram per day. My standard normal comfortable level is about
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.720]  a gram and a half to two and a half grams a day. That's just because it's available to me. It's
[12:08.720 --> 12:15.520]  right there. I could just smoke it. If I was going in, if it's like 420 or Friday, I could smoke
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.800]  like three grams, no problem. If I was really trying, I could do three to seven grams in a day.
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.440]  If we were going in, if you're like, how much do you think you could smoke, bro? I could probably
[12:25.440 --> 12:32.480]  take down 10 of these apothecary one gram jars or 10 of these Green Dot Labs one gram jars. I bet
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.840]  I could take down 10 of them in a day by myself. If I have friends over, those numbers change
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.160]  drastically. Of course, depending on who the friends are, if it's Clint, the dabs don't move.
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.880]  If it's Matt, he takes little dabs. If it's Mike, he takes little dabs. But some of my friends,
[12:46.880 --> 12:50.400]  they'll come over and they'll get globby and they're welcome to do it. That's what I invite
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.400]  them over for. I want to make them cough. I want to watch them change colors. That's always a good
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.800]  time. So that was a great question. Once again, big shout out to my buddy Fumidor and the Flavors.
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.680]  Please give him a follow. He posts wonderful videos, wonderful photography. He's a great,
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.680]  well-spoken dude. I thank him for the great YouTube comment. If you're not already doing so,
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.080]  I think it would be a whole lot cooler if you followed me on YouTube. Go to YouTube,
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.320]  search for the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, click subscribe, maybe leave some comments on
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.960]  the videos. Who knows? Maybe I will read one of your videos, one of your comments. It'd be easier
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.880]  to read your comments. Maybe I'll read your comments on a future episode. Not even going
[13:26.880 --> 13:31.760]  to edit that. We're going to keep going. Let's keep it moving by jumping into the email portion
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.920]  of this podcast. I like to read emails that come from my audience. If you've got a cannabis
[13:35.920 --> 13:41.360]  cultivation or a cannabis culture question, or in this case, a cannabis concentrate question,
[13:41.360 --> 13:45.920]  I would love to answer your question on the podcast. My email address is growfromyourheart
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.120]  at hotmail.com. The first email on today's episode goes like this. It says,
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.800]  Hey, Ross to Jeff. I hope all is well and you are staying safe and healthy. Yes, I am irey. I feel
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.320]  good. I think I'm healthy. I've been doing my exercises. I've been taking my vitamins. I've
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.080]  been eating well. I haven't had any caffeine or sugary crap or sodas in about six or eight weeks
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.240]  now, and I feel fucking good. So thanks for checking on me. I hope you are doing your part
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.680]  to stay safe. What's wrong with my face? Those concentrates are working or they're not. We may
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.760]  take a break and rip a dab here in just a moment if that keeps happening. I hope you are doing your
[14:19.760 --> 14:25.840]  part to stay safe and healthy as well, my friend. Thank you for the great email. It goes on to say,
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.560]  I have a couple of questions and I'll try to keep them short and to the point. Thank you. That is a
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.920]  really good way to get your question on the show. It goes on to say, first, what is the best way to
[14:35.920 --> 14:43.840]  store both BHO and hash for long-term preservations of terpenes and THC and other cannabinoids and
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.240]  volatile compounds? I may have added a couple of words to that sentence, but we're close enough.
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.680]  It also says, I like to keep a wide variety of flavors at one time, and I like to periodically
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.000]  dab on each one. So each gram lasts me about two months because it's not being dabbed on every day.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.720]  I have a wine cooler that I'm able to control the humidity on, so I'm wondering what the best
[15:04.720 --> 15:12.400]  option is. Man, you remind me a lot of myself and a lot of Mike. My concentrates do not last me
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.880]  nearly as long as yours, but when I go to the store, I do try to get one of that one, one of
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.360]  that one, one of that one. And the next time I do the same thing and I go before I run out.
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.960]  So I do have a nice buffet of concentrates on my table. I've got some Mambo Kush. I got Cowboy
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.320]  Kush. I got Soul Cleaner. I got GG4. There's Bruce Banner. I got Orange Skittles. There's
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.720]  Five on it. I got a whole bunch of, there's more shits in here. There's Sour Diesel. I got a bunch
[15:36.720 --> 15:42.640]  of stuff. I like having the buffet and the variety just like yourself, but I put two or three of them
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.440]  on the table and I mix and smoke those as I feel like it. And then when one runs out, I grab more.
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.920]  We'll talk about where I get them from in just a moment. But also Mike will go to the store
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.720]  and buy a couple of grams of concentrates. And I've talked about Mike's dab habits before.
[15:56.720 --> 16:03.120]  He takes dabs for ants. I think GI Joe may be happy with the size of a dab that Mike takes.
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.080]  GI Joe would still be like, bro, can I get a dab? And GI Joe is three and a quarter inches tall.
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.320]  That's what I'm saying, guys. Mike likes a little tiny dab. So Mike will go buy a couple of grams
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.080]  of concentrates and he won't smoke them. It'll take him a month. He'll bring them here and try
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.760]  to get me to help him smoke it. And I feel bad digging into his concentrate like that. I'm like,
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.040]  I don't want to smoke a half gram dab out of your jar. And he's like, do it buddy,
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.440]  because I'm not going to smoke it. And then he'll go to the dispensary again to buy flour and he'll
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.840]  get more concentrate just because he's there. And so he ends up with several jars of concentrates
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.880]  and he's got the collection a lot like yourself. Now you say that you have got a wine cooler
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.840]  available to yourself to keep the concentrates in. You'll notice that when you go to, I don't
[16:41.840 --> 16:46.960]  know where you're from, so maybe you won't notice. I notice that when I go to a dispensary,
[16:46.960 --> 16:52.240]  a quality dispensary will keep their quality concentrates in a refrigerator. Many of them
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.920]  have purchased the, it looks like a cooler where you would keep sodas or food type products on
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.280]  display at a smaller store. Not like the big grocery store, but like a convenience store,
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.040]  maybe where you'd get some ice creams or something out of the gas station cooler.
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.480]  They're nice looking coolers. They don't look trashy, but they're smaller than the big industrial,
[17:10.480 --> 17:13.920]  but they're nice looking. And they open the door and they pull out, they slide the door to the
[17:13.920 --> 17:17.920]  side and they pull out the concentrates out of there. Some of them have the glass front is nice
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.080]  and painted. I'm thinking of apothecary. They got that cooler door that's nicely painted with the
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.200]  apothecary logo on there. And then inside that cooler, they pop it open and all of the jars are
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.280]  inside of smaller containers and nicely labeled so they can just pull out what they need really
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.640]  quickly. So you'll notice that they do keep them in a cooler. Most of the compounds in our
[17:36.640 --> 17:42.400]  concentrates do volatilize at higher temperatures. So it is better to keep them at a lower temperature.
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.640]  One thing I will mention, if you're going to keep them in the cooler is make sure they are sealed.
[17:46.640 --> 17:51.200]  We don't want to get any moisture to them. If you've got the crisper drawer, that is an ideal
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.000]  spot. I put most of my concentrates in the little spot where you can put cheese or eggs because I
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.080]  don't fill my fridge with a lot of dairy products. So I've got all that space. When you swing the
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.800]  fridge open, there's a little drawer thing that the top slides up and it's just filled with high
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.080]  quality concentrates. It is basically my version of the apocalypse reserve. That is my hoarder
[18:10.080 --> 18:15.760]  stash. As long as I've got concentrates and seeds, everything else will be okay. So the crisper drawer
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.160]  or that little dairy drawer, if you've got one that slides up and down, that is a great spot
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.880]  for the concentrates. But make sure they stay dry. Don't let them get moist. Make sure the jar is
[18:24.880 --> 18:29.200]  tightly sealed. If they're going to be in there for a while, maybe put it inside of another container.
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.320]  Put it in a Tupperware, then throw that in the crisper drawer. Also, I've said this about seeds
[18:34.320 --> 18:39.520]  before. If you were going to get something really cool in the refrigerator and then take it out and
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.600]  open it and let it get to room temperature and then put it back and open it, you do get the
[18:43.600 --> 18:48.400]  option of condensation and moisture happening because of the temperature change from moving
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.640]  it in and out of the cool to the warm. I recommend if you're going to move it in and out, just keep
[18:54.720 --> 18:59.280]  it out or leave it in. Just get out what you need for the next two or three days. Have those sitting
[18:59.280 --> 19:03.280]  on the table for you to dab and put the rest in the cooler. Don't keep taking it out and putting
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.160]  it away, especially if it's getting nice and really cool to where you can cause moisture
[19:08.160 --> 19:12.160]  or condensation. You'll know that moisture level. You'll see it on a lot of the jars.
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.720]  When you take it out, it'll get frosty and foggy. That is when you've got the opportunity to get
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  condensation in your concentration. That's a lot of words to think about, you guys,
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.320]  with very minimal notes. There is more to this. Let me get myself back on track because I'm
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.440]  fucking high and rambly from the orange Skittles dabs. All right. I found my place. Thank you for
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.160]  being patient with me. It says, in this same question, as far as hash and rosin, do you
[19:36.160 --> 19:41.920]  recommend the freezer or the fridge for long-term storage? I recommend the fridge. I know some kids
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.640]  put the rosin in the freezer. I am not an expert or a connoisseur or much of a consumer when it
[19:48.640 --> 19:54.560]  comes to rosin. I don't buy rosin. If somebody gives it to me, I will gladly enjoy it, appreciate
[19:54.560 --> 20:01.200]  it, and dab the shit out of it. It's not something I go shopping for. I prefer BHO. I like batter. I
[20:01.200 --> 20:07.040]  like sauce. I like diamonds. I like different consistency than the rosin. If it's Pedro rosin,
[20:07.040 --> 20:12.000]  I may reach into my pocket and pull out some money for Pedro rosin. I may trade them for some seeds.
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.040]  But other than that, I'm not really interested in rosin. So I don't have much advice when it comes
[20:17.040 --> 20:22.240]  to rosin. If it's bubble rosin, if it's flower rosin, I really just have to say, I don't know.
[20:22.240 --> 20:28.400]  That is not my wheelhouse at all. I don't recommend the freezer for most of the concentrates,
[20:28.400 --> 20:32.800]  again, because you're going to get condensation in there. So I would just say the fridge and try to
[20:32.800 --> 20:36.880]  keep it dry. I'm trying to find my place on the rest of this email. There's a lot going on, and
[20:36.880 --> 20:42.640]  it's a really small font. There we go. Next piece, next question. So I've been smoking for about the
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.840]  seven years. I feel I've gotten to the point where I don't feel the different effects from
[20:47.840 --> 20:53.520]  different strains, and it somewhat upsets me. I really only dab now and every other time.
[20:53.520 --> 20:58.400]  No matter if I'm dabbing something new that's a heavy sativa or a heavy indica, I kind of just
[20:58.400 --> 21:05.360]  get stoned. Really, the only effects I feel are in my eyes and how slow and lethargic I feel.
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.080]  I don't remember the last time I had an energetic high or felt any sort of effect other than just
[21:10.080 --> 21:15.520]  that stoned feeling. I appreciate your time and everything you do. Feel free to say my name if
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.400]  either question happens to make it to the show from your friend, Matt. Hey, Matt, big shout out
[21:20.400 --> 21:26.400]  because your whole email made it to the show. I'm not sure what to say about your disappointment in
[21:26.400 --> 21:31.840]  your tolerance level other than to say, maybe take a break for a few days, bro. We call that a
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.600]  tolerance break. We call it a reset. Your cannabinoid receptors, your terpene receptors,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.120]  they're fucking full, dude. You got to let them dry out for a little while. You got to
[21:41.120 --> 21:44.720]  let it kind of get sensitive again. You've been playing with it too much, bro. Give it a rest.
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.240]  You're going to go blind if you keep playing with it. You know what I'm saying? You've either got
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.640]  to take a break or you've got to step up the quality of your product. You're saying that
[21:52.640 --> 21:57.200]  you're not getting the desired buzz. Maybe there's something in your body that your body's just
[21:57.200 --> 22:02.640]  going, I'm tired of smoking. There are occasions, occasional periods in my life where my body goes,
[22:02.640 --> 22:06.720]  you don't need to smoke so much this week, dude. Fucking settle down. What are you trying to do?
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.000]  You're not going to enjoy the high. I'm going to make your body not enjoy this high. You're
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.440]  going to feel something uncomfortable because there are other things you need to worry about.
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.120]  You need to hydrate. You need to get some vitamins in you. Think about some nutrients and some
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.880]  minerals. Then in a couple of days, when you fix all this dumb shit going on with your body,
[22:20.880 --> 22:27.280]  then we can take some dabs. Or maybe, maybe this is worst case scenario, maybe you've got a medical
[22:27.280 --> 22:30.960]  condition that your body hasn't told you about yet. Maybe you haven't identified something.
[22:30.960 --> 22:35.520]  Maybe smoking is aiming at that medical condition. I've always said that if something hurts or if
[22:35.520 --> 22:40.400]  you've got a problem and you smoke cannabis or you consume cannabis, that your body and the
[22:40.400 --> 22:44.320]  cannabis have a talk and it goes, oh, your shoulder hurts. I'm going to go over here to the shoulder,
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.640]  rub, rub, rub, rub, rub. And it makes your shoulder feel better, but it forgets to get you stoned.
[22:48.640 --> 22:52.720]  A lot like how I feel if you take pharmaceuticals, if you've got real pain and you take some
[22:52.720 --> 22:56.880]  pharmaceuticals, those pharmaceuticals make your knee not hurt that you had surgery on. But if you
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.400]  don't have a painful knee, you're going to get all fucked up because you don't have any pain for that
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.360]  to work on. I think cannabis kind of does that as well. Maybe you got to go to the doctor and
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.080]  get your health checked out. Are you okay? See what's going on. It's always a good idea to go
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.000]  get your health checked. No matter how old, how young, how healthy you feel, go see what's going
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.760]  on. So tolerance break, maybe the first issue. Step up your dabs, step up your quality. Maybe
[23:19.760 --> 23:24.160]  the second move, third, make sure nothing else is wrong. Is all your blood work looking good?
[23:24.160 --> 23:28.800]  Are you healthy? Are you happy? Maybe it's just time to take a weed break. You're saying that
[23:28.800 --> 23:33.200]  you're getting red-eyed and lethargic. I'm wondering if that's a strain that you're smoking,
[23:33.200 --> 23:36.960]  if you're getting your product from the same place all the time, or if your body is just
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.480]  burned out on smoking cannabis, because those are the two least desirable effects when it comes to
[23:42.480 --> 23:46.560]  smoking cannabis. You don't need bright red eyes. Then who wants to be lazy and lethargic? You're
[23:46.560 --> 23:52.080]  right. I do like that nice energetic buzz. Maybe if you smoke something a little more quality,
[23:52.080 --> 23:54.720]  and I don't know where you're getting your product, I don't know what you're smoking,
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.040]  I don't mean to sound like a snob or disrespectful or anything. You sound like you know what you're
[23:59.040 --> 24:02.960]  talking about because you're talking about different kinds of concentrates. But also,
[24:02.960 --> 24:06.960]  maybe you're growing all of it. Maybe you're letting it go long enough to where it starts
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.000]  to degrade and you're getting that more down of a buzz. I'm not sure. I don't have those details.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.640]  I'm just guessing and trying to offer opinions. I don't know where you are, but come take a dab
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.600]  of this Orange Skittles batter and see if this one fucks you up and gets you talkative and makes
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.160]  you energetic like it does me. That is a good spot to start. We'll pay attention to you. We can
[24:26.160 --> 24:30.000]  make you like our own stoned little science experiment. I'll let you borrow my whoop strap.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.560]  We'll see how your heart rate goes. We'll see how you sleep. We'll feed you, take good care of you.
[24:34.560 --> 24:39.440]  For science, bro. For science. All right, Matt, I hope I answered your question sufficiently.
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.840]  I feel like I got the first part of it down pretty good. The storage of the concentrates,
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.320]  don't let them get condensation, but do keep them in the fridge. Then as far as your tolerance,
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.720]  you may have to take a little break, my dude. Clean out your body, flush out the system,
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.960]  reset, get your brain and your body all started fresh, clean out the filters, then let's dirty
[24:56.960 --> 25:01.200]  them all up all over again. It will feel good to clean out your body. It'll feel really good for
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.000]  your mental and physical health. Then if that's not what you want to do, maybe step up the quality
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  of your concentrates and then also go to the doctor and see if something else is fucking you
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.920]  up. Also, here's another idea. Are you eating too much or drinking too much caffeine? Is there too
[25:15.920 --> 25:21.760]  much sugar, too much caffeine in your diet that's overriding the buzz? I caught myself playing the
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.240]  juggle game. I would wake up and I would take two or three dabs. Then about an hour later,
[25:26.240 --> 25:29.680]  when the buzz wore off, I'd be like, fuck, I'm done. I just want to go take a nap.
[25:29.680 --> 25:34.560]  So my response was to go to Starbucks and get a giant fucking coffee. Then after I drank about
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.080]  half of that coffee, I could feel my heart trying to beat out of my chest and my hands would get
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.560]  shaky. I'd get a little bit anxious and I'd be like, fuck, I need a dab. I'm way too jittery.
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.520]  So I'd go take two dabs. Then about an hour later, I'd say, fuck, those dabs wore me out.
[25:47.520 --> 25:51.840]  I'm crashing from the coffee. So I chugged the second half of the coffee. Then 30 minutes later,
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.160]  you're going, holy shit, I can hear my heartbeat. I got to go take two more dabs. Then you go take
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.720]  two dabs and now you're crashing from that caffeine buzz and you're fucking stoned to shit.
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.280]  I caught myself just doing this weird constant battle. Then I was giving myself,
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.560]  my body was hurting and I was getting anxiety and I felt like shit. Sometimes I would lay down to go
[26:10.560 --> 26:16.320]  to bed at night and I could feel my heartbeat in my toes and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
[26:16.320 --> 26:21.760]  I knew that shit wasn't right. It was from the constant battle all day of Starbucks versus dabs,
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.760]  which is going to win. Neither one of them were going to win, but I was going to lose.
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.880]  So I cut out the fucking Starbucks. I'm not cutting out the dabs. That's cool. No, you're
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.840]  crazy. But I cut out the Starbucks. I cut out all of the Dr. Pepper. I've cut out most of the sugar.
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.840]  I've cut out most of the crap in my diet. When I did that, I noticed I started getting ridiculously
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.680]  higher. Now that I'm not battling my dabs with constant caffeine and constant sugar, I'm able
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.120]  to get a real serious buzz going on and it lasts longer and it feels better. So that could be
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.160]  something that is fucking up your buzz. All right, Matt, thanks again for getting me set off on a
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.440]  good ramble. I do appreciate the great email. If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation,
