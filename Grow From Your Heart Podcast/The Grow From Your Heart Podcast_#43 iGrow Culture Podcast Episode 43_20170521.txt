[00:16.000 --> 00:21.240]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen, it's time for episode number 43 of the I Grow Culture
[00:21.240 --> 00:26.960]  podcast, the podcast all about cannabis news, education and culture. If you're a new grower,
[00:26.960 --> 00:31.000]  a professional grower, a long time cannabis consumer, a brand new smoker, or even someone
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.080]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.560]  for you. Thanks again for joining us. Guys, as promised at the table today is our good
[00:39.560 --> 00:43.280]  friend King Cola. How are you doing brother? Good man. Good. Thanks for having me. Oh man.
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.180]  Thanks a lot for coming. Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule. All these
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.280]  growers are super busy. We're sitting here talking about all the stuff we're doing. How
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.140]  are you doing Jesse? Pretty good. You looking better this week? Yes. My skin and complexion
[00:55.140 --> 00:59.560]  is the right color on both feet. Quit making fun of Jesse. He's back. He's on his feet.
[00:59.560 --> 01:04.160]  We took a lot of dabs today. He redeemed himself. He's on his game. Sean brought some solvent
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.840]  lists. It's delicious. And Jesse did not die. No, not at all. My blood sugar is correct
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.080]  today. Yeah. I was worried about coming on here with you guys. I'm not a big BHO smoker.
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.320]  I didn't even ask that. I was going to ask that as we were, uh, as the show progressed,
[01:18.320 --> 01:21.880]  I had a BHO question for you. So I was going to see if you're a dabber. I am actually,
[01:21.880 --> 01:27.000]  I, I, I grew up with Spencer man. Like, come on. But in the same sense, I was pampered.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.920]  So when you smoke his chatter, you can't really go to smoking a dispensary. So I was just
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.520]  like, screw it. I'll make some ice wax. Do you smoke live resin? Um, I've had the pleasure
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.240]  of trying it a couple of times from his personal stash and good gracious. It is amazing, isn't
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.840]  it? It really is. I'd like to steal some of his tech on that one. It's a herpy, herpy
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.080]  slurpee by the time this episode airs. Uh, in my mind, I feel like Spencer will have
[01:53.080 --> 01:58.040]  won the secret cup. Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption. He's there now. The competition
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.120]  actually happens a Sunday night. I think the judging happens. So by the time this episode
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.280]  comes out, he will be the champion of the secret cup and I can reveal what was entered.
[02:07.280 --> 02:14.160]  Um, it was white widow grown by Rasta. Yeah, it's like, Oh no, no, you can't. You can't
[02:14.160 --> 02:17.240]  say that, but this won't come out. This is now that everybody knows now it was white
[02:17.240 --> 02:21.960]  widow grown by Rasta Jeff of I read genetics. It was the cut. Uh, Spence gave me the cut
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.480]  a while back. I crossed that cut to grateful dog and I actually made Capleton with it.
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.560]  I love that white widow dude. It grows like a boss. It kicks out multiple donkey dicks
[02:31.560 --> 02:37.280]  like menorahs of donkey. It's so awesome. Yeah. So I hope that does well for you. Good
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.280]  luck brother. I hope you brought home a trophy either way. If he won or not, I plan to get
[02:41.280 --> 02:45.440]  him here on the show. He might be the episode after this, his schedule pending. It's up
[02:45.440 --> 02:49.240]  to him. He's invited. He knows he's welcome anytime. Hopefully we can get him. Shout out
[02:49.240 --> 02:52.920]  Spence shout out to big D shout out to Jeremy. Shout out everyone involved with the secret
[02:52.920 --> 02:57.320]  cup. We'll do a wrap up on that one in the next show. Uh, let's do an ad real quick.

[04:57.120 --> 05:01.040]  If you're buying a nano lux light, you're going to save quite a few bucks. Jesse just
[05:01.040 --> 05:06.520]  looked at me like we didn't think of that. No, that's cool. We got them in a in stock
[05:06.520 --> 05:12.880]  now too. Nice. We got and you know, enough to get going there in the store. I just saw
[05:12.880 --> 05:16.920]  you visualize the shelf. He looked up at my wall as if the shelf would be there and he
[05:16.920 --> 05:21.720]  could see it. And I think he counted them. Um, I don't know if it's how many is there
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.520]  or if we're going to get the order by the time to show shows. So there's two different
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.000]  numbers going through my head there. Either way they will, they will get your nano lux
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.360]  lighting needs taken care of. They look to be quality lights, uh, much loved all the
[05:33.360 --> 05:36.240]  sponsors. I appreciate it. You guys, thanks for helping us out. If you're interested in
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.240]  sponsoring the show, email me, it's a, I grew a culture at hotmail.com and we'll get it
[05:40.240 --> 05:46.360]  going. So I've got a couple of things I gotta say a big shout out to Angela, Adam, and Mike,
[05:46.360 --> 05:51.240]  dude, you guys trimmed for seven hours last night. Thank you. Uh, I would have gotten
[05:51.760 --> 05:54.400]  nuts without it. Sean just looked over and saw the trimmed pots and shook his head. Those
[05:54.400 --> 05:59.920]  are big pots. I've been at it for like a week trimming by myself. I know good trimmers.
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.840]  If you need them all, they're there. I'll give you their numbers. They're yours. They
[06:02.840 --> 06:06.600]  need money. You just got to pay them decently. It's a big shout out to those guys. They helped
[06:06.600 --> 06:11.880]  me out trim and I could not have got through it. Also a big, huge shout out to Hanky B.
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.240]  A Hanky B gave me some live resin to dab. I was hanging out his house and as I left,
[06:15.240 --> 06:18.280]  he goes here, man, take some of this. And just gave me like a grandma live res. Uh,
[06:18.280 --> 06:22.400]  make sure you follow him on Instagram. That's hard to say. He's Hanky B 11. He told me to
[06:22.400 --> 06:26.280]  make sure I say that cause he gave me a hash. It's a big shout out to Hank. Uh, we'll skip
[06:26.280 --> 06:30.200]  some shout outs for now. That's enough. Let's get onto the meat of the show here. We got
[06:30.200 --> 06:35.240]  a guy that does all kinds of organics and we've been talking about a lot of grow lessons.
[06:35.240 --> 06:38.960]  So I guess the first question to jump right into it, dude, if we just want to get down
[06:38.960 --> 06:44.600]  to it and you want to tell me all about organic as fuck. Uh, yeah, well organic is a fuck
[06:44.600 --> 06:50.080]  is just a hashtag we started using. Um, it's created by like a little closer to you. There
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.320]  you go. I just want to get you well. Oh, you're good. Um, but yeah, Jesse actually started
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.760]  the hashtag and stole it off of his page. Um, but no, it's the idea is that, uh, all
[06:59.760 --> 07:05.440]  organic. Um, we don't like the idea of any bottled fertilizers, synthetic nutrients,
[07:05.440 --> 07:12.440]  uh, specifically, you know, pesticides, anything with mineral salts, map and DAP, uh, mono
[07:12.600 --> 07:19.600]  amatic, um, mono ammonium phosphates, uh, you know, preservatives. There you go. Um,
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.600]  the idea is to create a clean product, um, food grade everything. I probably buy half
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.840]  of the products I use at our local natural grocers. Uh, so really big emphasis on growing
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.840]  style. Um, that's most growers tend to focus on flower where we focus on the soil. Um,
[07:38.920 --> 07:45.920]  I feel a lot of stuff is lost when you're just focusing on weight, uh, high vegetative
[07:46.280 --> 07:53.280]  yields, uh, you know, quick flowering times. You're just losing a lot of money time. I
[07:54.080 --> 07:59.160]  mean, you're just losing so much in that process. Exactly. And then hurting the environment
[07:59.160 --> 08:03.000]  and a lot of other people. And that's what that part is. What's really got me interested.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.860]  I want to learn a lot from you to maybe shift my growth toward this style. And my reasoning
[08:06.900 --> 08:12.820]  is the sustainability. Uh, I've got a kid and she's 11 now. And I keep thinking about
[08:12.820 --> 08:16.780]  the stuff that I hear. I read about what they're making my nutrients out of. And then I'm thinking
[08:16.780 --> 08:23.400]  about, uh, I toured a large growth facility that runs a lot of hydro and they have lots
[08:23.400 --> 08:27.260]  of water that has to be flushed out as waste. And I thought, where does that go? That's
[08:27.260 --> 08:30.740]  going back to our municipal water supply and being filtered out. And when you get water
[08:30.740 --> 08:34.420]  out of the sink, that's what we're drinking. And that really that stuff the past few years
[08:34.420 --> 08:38.740]  has had me think, and I want to get more sustainable and no offense to the hydro shops,
[08:38.740 --> 08:43.660]  but I love them because they help us out, but we don't need to be paying overmarked
[08:43.660 --> 08:47.620]  prices for a botanic care bottle because it says botanic care. When Sean can teach us
[08:47.620 --> 08:52.420]  how to take that chicken shit and seabird guano and make something that we can one day
[08:52.420 --> 08:55.700]  the end of the world is coming and you can't go to the hydro shop. Then I totally agree.
[08:55.700 --> 08:59.100]  Sean's going to outgrow us. Yeah. Sean's going to outgrow all of us when that day comes.
[08:59.100 --> 09:04.380]  I do feel hypocritical sometimes because I use very few products from our store as well.
[09:05.340 --> 09:07.580]  Yeah. But see your store, it has the option.
[09:07.580 --> 09:10.380]  Ours is a little different than most I like to think.
[09:10.380 --> 09:14.220]  I was pretty blown away when I first walked in there. And that's coming from a guy who
[09:14.220 --> 09:16.940]  just absolutely hates hydro stores.
[09:18.300 --> 09:22.860]  So you're doing it mostly out of the organics for the clean product, for the food grade.
[09:22.860 --> 09:27.340]  I'm interested more for the sustainability. I think that's both a great reason to do it.
[09:27.900 --> 09:32.460]  One thing that got my attention right off the bat, you said you don't use any pesticides or
[09:32.460 --> 09:37.500]  non-organic pesticides. I'm really curious. And I bet the listeners are too. How do you keep bugs
[09:37.500 --> 09:42.460]  out of your crop without some nuclear attack? Right at the beginning of the fall here, everybody
[09:42.460 --> 09:48.060]  I know got three types of bugs at once. Three letters. I P M.
[09:48.060 --> 09:51.820]  Can I guess what that means? Ladies and gentlemen, integrated pest management.
[09:51.820 --> 09:55.500]  Please write that down. That's important. We will talk about that a lot. That's going to be a
[09:55.500 --> 09:59.020]  glossary term that you need to mark. IPM, integrated pest management.
[09:59.020 --> 10:02.220]  Prevention is the only guaranteed form of pest control.
[10:03.180 --> 10:09.660]  100%. And if you don't want to deal with pests, then you have to start a program. And that starts
[10:09.660 --> 10:16.700]  with a nice organic base. You want to start out with things high in chitin, insect, frass, crab,
[10:16.700 --> 10:23.420]  meal, things, neem cake, all of that into the soil mix. Then you want to start off on a regiment of
[10:24.940 --> 10:31.100]  silica. What else? Aloe vera. You want to build, you want to strengthen the plant, help it build its
[10:31.660 --> 10:35.660]  cell walls. Basically, you need to build its immune system so it can take care of itself.
[10:35.660 --> 10:42.460]  Throw away the bottle of potassium silicates and use the aloe vera and the... What was the other
[10:42.460 --> 10:47.260]  one that you said that I felt would really build the cell walls? The silica. Yeah, silica is just
[10:47.260 --> 10:54.060]  such an underutilized thing in growing. I'm pretty sure both of you guys can contest that in synthetics
[10:54.060 --> 10:57.580]  or hydro, organic, whatever. Build cell walls. It's all the fiber growth.
[10:57.580 --> 11:02.380]  Exactly. The stronger your leaf wall is, the stronger it's going to be able to stand up to
[11:02.380 --> 11:09.260]  attack. What do you use to get silica in organics? There's a couple of different options on the...
[11:09.260 --> 11:13.740]  Actually, there's thousands of different options on the market. Potassium silicate is probably the
[11:13.740 --> 11:20.940]  number one most common. It's really... That's a good one to use. Most companies sell it. Most
[11:20.940 --> 11:27.740]  organic companies sell it. I personally use silica derived from diatomite through the majority of my
[11:27.740 --> 11:34.460]  growth. Potassium silicate though does have its place from my clones, obviously late in flower.
[11:34.460 --> 11:39.100]  I do prefer potassium silicate a little bit more. Is that the stuff that's in desiccant packs
[11:39.820 --> 11:43.100]  in your box of shoes, new shoes, or you guys want to talk about?
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.660]  It sounds like... It looks like a familiar word. Now that I'm thinking about that,
[11:47.660 --> 11:50.620]  it looks like the same word on there, but I can't promise. That's what it says on the side
[11:50.620 --> 11:53.980]  of those little packs. I think so. It says desiccant pack on there. Yeah. Well, no, I think
[11:53.980 --> 12:00.940]  it says potassium silicate too. It wouldn't surprise me. It's all very common stuff. And then the
[12:00.940 --> 12:05.980]  diatomite, the silica derived from diatomite is basically diatomaceous earth, which you're probably
[12:05.980 --> 12:11.260]  more familiar with. Got a rough texture, kind of crushes up the... Kind of cuts up the bugs if they
[12:11.260 --> 12:15.980]  try to get through. It's like walking on glass for a bug. So your plants never get sprayed?
[12:15.980 --> 12:21.500]  Well, actually they do. I foliar spray every day. I probably overkill on my foliar spray.
[12:24.140 --> 12:27.900]  Every grower likes to spend time in their garden. And if you can find a way to do it,
[12:28.780 --> 12:35.260]  go for it, man. And in my ways to spray. So I do break it down into regiments. Shout out to
[12:35.260 --> 12:41.500]  Dragonfly Earth Medicine with their natural mystic teas of foliar sprays, their soil inoculates and
[12:41.580 --> 12:48.700]  other herbal inoculates. But that's a big part of my spray regimen. Homemade compost teas, FPJs,
[12:48.700 --> 12:53.820]  FFJs, so fermented fruit juices, fermented plant juices that I make myself. And you're actually
[12:53.820 --> 12:57.180]  spraying that on your plants? Spraying that on the plants. How late into flower would you do that?
[12:57.180 --> 13:01.740]  I usually don't go past week four or five. Just like a traditional spray. Sounds good. Even though
[13:01.740 --> 13:09.020]  it's organic, things just tend to stick around. Okay. Yeah. And you can cause problems going past
[13:09.020 --> 13:14.620]  week four or five, I assume. Exactly. Especially everything that I use is very sugary. You know,
[13:14.620 --> 13:20.300]  fruit juices and plant juices and everything's got molasses. He brought some nugs, you guys.
[13:20.300 --> 13:25.900]  I'm not going to say that I was a hater of organics, but I feel he stood up for himself
[13:25.900 --> 13:29.740]  before anybody even mentioned it. He said, I brought this to show you that it's dense and it's
[13:29.740 --> 13:34.380]  odorifficent and it's covered in trichomes and it's all of that. The trichomes are actually real.
[13:34.380 --> 13:39.180]  They're not tall. They don't stick off the bud that he showed me real far, but they're compacted.
[13:39.180 --> 13:43.100]  They're everywhere all over that nugget. Even between where the two little buds touch on that
[13:43.100 --> 13:47.740]  branch, they're between there. You got resin everywhere on that. Thanks. So the organics do
[13:47.740 --> 13:51.500]  work. I can see the proof. And I'm doing, you know, I do some consulting on the side, but I'm
[13:51.500 --> 13:56.380]  actually working with a couple of concentrate companies. Shout out Blood Diamond Extracts.
[13:56.380 --> 14:01.180]  They're really killing the game right now. Nice. Shout out your consulting company too.
[14:02.060 --> 14:07.580]  Yeah. Rocky Mountain Natural Farming. You can check us out on Instagram, but a lot of these
[14:07.580 --> 14:12.700]  guys, you know, they're making BHO and it's funny. You have your little meme on the internet of
[14:13.900 --> 14:18.860]  says he grows vegan and can only smokes BHO. But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of guys out there
[14:18.860 --> 14:23.980]  who will back me on this when saying organics produce better hash. I feel the trichomes more
[14:23.980 --> 14:30.060]  fully developed. You, your membrane's more intact. You're not going to get that mush. I see it a lot,
[14:30.060 --> 14:35.260]  especially when making the ice wax. As you can see, this is some stuff that's locally grown.
[14:36.300 --> 14:40.380]  Um, or actually here's a better, I think I smoked this the other night. One of your buddies had
[14:40.380 --> 14:45.340]  some of this. I actually made it for him. Okay. Yeah. This is, uh, I believe it's organically
[14:45.340 --> 14:49.100]  grown. Um, but in the sense that, you know, you probably went to the store and bought some
[14:49.100 --> 14:54.780]  organics, organic soup. Exactly. And then you can look at this one. It still has a nice smell. A lot
[14:54.780 --> 14:59.340]  of the solvents, they kind of loses the odor in my opinion, and it's still got that dank smell.
[14:59.340 --> 15:05.500]  Um, but I believe that the, that maybe the, it's degrading a little quicker. So, you know,
[15:05.500 --> 15:10.220]  check the quality of that one. Yeah. I like this. I like this one a lot. And then check that one.
[15:10.220 --> 15:15.660]  Oh, this one. I've hit this one. This one is tasty. Uh, who did you say made this? Uh, that
[15:15.660 --> 15:22.220]  was made by trichome heavy extracts. Shout out to jibs and grown by growing Kushwana Maha. Shout
[15:22.220 --> 15:28.300]  out Rob. He was just killing the game right now. Um, I walked into the first cannabis cup. Nobody
[15:28.300 --> 15:32.860]  knew who I read genetics was. I hadn't put my face on Instagram yet. And I had my shirt on
[15:32.860 --> 15:36.940]  and growing Kush one mile high spotted me right away. And he goes, dude, your I read genetics
[15:36.940 --> 15:41.340]  come here and took a picture with me and posted it to Instagram. And now my face was out. That's
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.100]  what did it. That's what put my face on Instagram. That's when I was like, well, I'm the tall guy
[15:45.100 --> 15:51.340]  with dreadlocks. That's how it goes. I remember that. Yup. Yup. He's a, he's very humble dude.
[15:51.340 --> 15:56.140]  Um, if you want to get your genetics out there, get him to grow it and tell you that much. I like
[15:56.140 --> 16:01.500]  that. He kills it. Cool. Agro and Kush one mile high. Email me, bro. You're getting a seed pack.
[16:03.580 --> 16:08.140]  Some stuff should be ready. Some stuff should be ready here in a couple of weeks. If everything
[16:08.140 --> 16:11.900]  goes well, do you think that you were, I'm going to kind of back loop here. You said that the
[16:11.900 --> 16:16.940]  trichomes have a better, the trichome heads have a better casing from organics. Do you think that
[16:16.940 --> 16:20.860]  it's because we're using what the plant actually wants instead of feeding it junk food out of a
[16:20.860 --> 16:25.660]  bottle? Exactly. I've, I feel a synthetic approaches. Like you said, junk food is just
[16:26.220 --> 16:30.780]  such an appropriate term. Um, your buds are going to get denser. They're going to get bigger.
[16:30.780 --> 16:35.580]  They're going to get fatter. Does that necessarily mean they're any better? No. I mean, it's only
[16:35.580 --> 16:41.500]  better for your wallet. Exactly. And, um, and we're fortunate enough to be in an industry or
[16:41.500 --> 16:47.020]  at a point in this industry where maybe that doesn't matter as much anymore. Um, so now that
[16:47.020 --> 16:53.340]  people aren't all obsessed with hitting, you know, seven pounds per light, uh, we can focus
[16:53.340 --> 17:00.860]  a little bit more on quality. What strain was that? Uh, you know, it was from BC. Uh, I'm pretty
[17:00.860 --> 17:05.180]  sure we were trimming last night and, uh, there was one plant and that's a perfect example. One
[17:05.180 --> 17:10.300]  plant kicked out donkey dicks, the size of my arms. And then the girl scout cookies had little popcorn,
[17:10.300 --> 17:15.420]  but there was as much resin on that little popcorn of girl scout cookies as there was spread amongst
[17:15.420 --> 17:21.580]  that entire other plant. It was so dank. That little cookies plant is just coded. I'd rather
[17:21.580 --> 17:26.540]  grow more of those. If I didn't have picky patients, if my patients weren't demanding of
[17:26.540 --> 17:30.620]  the grateful dog and other strains, I'd grow all cookies just because the resident puts out. It's
[17:30.620 --> 17:36.140]  so gorgeous cookies, Yeti and SFE. Yeah. There'd be some grateful dog in there, but I'd definitely
[17:36.140 --> 17:43.260]  have like a 36 light room of just cookies, cookies, cookies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I may, uh,
[17:43.260 --> 17:46.860]  I kind of want to mention things, but I don't want to say too much. I am in the process of
[17:46.860 --> 17:55.900]  possibly, uh, taking on a bad-ass position, running 227 lights. Do it. I'm if everything
[17:55.900 --> 18:03.900]  works out within the next month, I will be in there growing under 227. Gavitas. Hell yeah. I'm
[18:03.900 --> 18:11.020]  a little stoked. It's all hydro tables. It's going to be fun. All right. So try better trichome heads
[18:11.020 --> 18:14.700]  because of organics. Does the aloe vera have anything to do with that? You think the same way
[18:14.700 --> 18:20.540]  it makes my skin more supple and doesn't burn it under the sun or under the grow light. Yeah. Okay.
[18:20.540 --> 18:26.460]  I mean, you know, you can really go into the properties of aloe and yucca and the saponin and
[18:27.260 --> 18:31.660]  all of that stuff. That's, you know, 30 minutes worth of conversation. But bottom line is, is it,
[18:31.660 --> 18:37.660]  it increases the health of your plant. Um, silica, aloe, coconut water. Those are the basis, uh,
[18:37.660 --> 18:42.620]  outside of that. Um, I'm glad you say that. Cause I preach those products other than the, uh, the
[18:42.620 --> 18:47.100]  silica. I'm always about aloe and coconut water. I teach a lot of people that it's a necessity.
[18:50.700 --> 18:55.260]  I drink coconut water myself and I feel amazing when I drink it. Yeah. And you know, with the
[18:55.260 --> 18:59.500]  style of gardening that I use, I like the idea that me and my plants share the same food.
[19:00.380 --> 19:05.500]  You know, the more I grow and the more I evolve into this, I think my plants, I was a vegetarian
[19:05.500 --> 19:10.220]  before I grew, I took decent care of myself, but I think learning about the plant biology has made
[19:10.220 --> 19:14.620]  me take better care of myself and it's influenced my shopping when I go to vitamin cottage or
[19:14.620 --> 19:19.740]  whatever grocery store I hit. Uh, and Jesse has done it too. His organic practices have influenced
[19:19.740 --> 19:24.380]  my shopping and my eating a little bit. And it's, which in turn has affected my growing. Cause now
[19:24.380 --> 19:28.940]  you're here to teach me how to be more healthy, more sustainable. So I see it going full circle.
[19:28.940 --> 19:33.820]  That's there's a passion there. I like it. I feel like people, uh, maybe put a little bit
[19:33.820 --> 19:37.500]  too much emphasis on the switch. I mean, if you're running soilless and you're running
[19:37.500 --> 19:41.900]  botanic care, you're, you're almost there. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'm just scared, dude. I,
[19:41.900 --> 19:46.620]  my patients love what I do and I've got, I love even I grow promise. I've got grateful dog grown
[19:46.620 --> 19:50.300]  to perfection, you know, with, with the way I do it. And then I'm, I didn't get it that way with
[19:50.300 --> 19:54.540]  a few strains, but it's a big jump for me to just go change, but I may do it. I'm going to write
[19:54.540 --> 19:59.820]  down what you do and kind of, and I can, people will probably disagree with me on this, but I
[19:59.820 --> 20:05.180]  don't think you're going to lose yield. Um, I've swear up and down that this whole organics yields
[20:05.180 --> 20:11.180]  less as a, just a, as a misconception in the industry. I mean, it really is. Unfortunately,
[20:11.180 --> 20:15.740]  you do have people, it's a different approach than traditional gardening. Um, so you've got
[20:15.740 --> 20:20.940]  guys out there who've been doing hydro or soilless mixes for years, switching to super soils and
[20:20.940 --> 20:25.740]  burning their plants and all organics doesn't yield anything, but it reflects a lot on the
[20:25.740 --> 20:30.300]  grower. Also, I think somebody like you could definitely just take off with it, especially
[20:30.300 --> 20:35.660]  with your experience with additives. And that's the key is with organics. You start a base. A lot
[20:35.660 --> 20:40.620]  of people like to water, never or water every time. I'm sorry. They don't use anything but water. Me
[20:40.620 --> 20:44.780]  personally, I like to water never. Um, and that's kind of your style now where you're giving it,
[20:46.460 --> 20:49.900]  I don't know all the product name, but you're giving them silica and you're giving them yucca
[20:49.900 --> 20:54.220]  and you're giving them everything that I am just, just in a liquid bottle. I'm doing it the lazy
[20:54.220 --> 20:59.020]  way. And you know how most of that stuff is made is it's a compost tea. And then, so they make like
[20:59.020 --> 21:04.620]  a compost tea and then they basically they'll arrest fermentation. Um, so they stop and kill
[21:04.620 --> 21:09.500]  all the living organisms in there, run it through a protein skimmer, bottle it up and then sell it
[21:09.500 --> 21:15.100]  to you. Um, so just cut out the middle man, just make it yourself. There we go. By the summer guys,
[21:15.100 --> 21:18.940]  we should all be making our own newts when it's warm and we're in Colorado. I'm not going out in
[21:18.940 --> 21:22.780]  the backyard and doing it this week, but I got a garage. If I had some space by the summer,
[21:22.780 --> 21:26.860]  we'll get it going. We'll all be grown organic. Let's get away. We have to support the hydro
[21:26.860 --> 21:30.140]  shops. Go buy the organics there. Get the stuff that's in the box, the blood meal, the bone meal
[21:30.140 --> 21:35.180]  things. If you're doing that, uh, get your worm castings and stuff wherever you eat locally.
[21:35.180 --> 21:39.580]  Yeah. Go, go to high grow and make sure that when you're mixing your soil, talk to Jesse
[21:39.580 --> 21:43.580]  about that. Cause he can fill you in on the whole bone meal and blood meal thing. I'm pretty sure
[21:43.580 --> 21:47.180]  Jesse loves to talk to people at high grow. He loves to just stand there and get paid to talk.
[21:47.820 --> 21:51.500]  Yeah. So it's better than a advanced, but you know,
[21:52.620 --> 21:57.260]  bone meal and blood milk can be approved upon as well. So exactly. And this goes back to the,
[21:57.260 --> 22:03.100]  the veganics we were kind of talking about before the show, uh, by no means do I claim to be a V
[22:03.100 --> 22:08.700]  and a grower. We use a hashtag called beyond veganics to kind of poke fun at it. Uh, just
[22:08.700 --> 22:15.740]  for the simple fact, vegan growing is kind of funny. Just like vegans are right. I love that.
[22:16.380 --> 22:19.420]  How do you know someone's a vegan? Don't worry. They'll tell you.
[22:20.540 --> 22:26.060]  Exactly. And that's really how it is is, you know, these vegan, these veganic growers are,
[22:26.060 --> 22:30.540]  they're using just bottled nutrients. I mean, you know, it's just plain and simple. And if
[22:30.540 --> 22:34.060]  they're not, they're really depriving their plants of, you know, certain things they could
[22:34.060 --> 22:39.500]  be using, uh, earthworm castings, for example. Like I know people, there's a nice little shout
[22:39.500 --> 22:44.460]  out you can get right there. Yeah, J, uh, Rocky Mount earthworm castings. Um, I know Jesse uses
[22:44.460 --> 22:51.580]  it. Uh, I use it, um, they're super high quality. Um, he is killing the game right now. Dedicated
[22:51.580 --> 22:56.860]  his life to making, uh, castings for people like me and Jesse. I've heard a lot of good things.
[22:56.860 --> 23:02.700]  If you're a customer of my store and you use a earthworm castings, ask me for him.
[23:02.700 --> 23:08.380]  Yes. Do that. Yeah, please do. Um, you know, as a organic grower, uh, I've been in Colorado for
[23:08.380 --> 23:13.420]  about two years now. Um, before then I grew, is that all I've known you bros two years? It's only
[23:13.420 --> 23:18.460]  been two years. It's been a long time. Right on. Time flies. Um, but no, so, uh, you know, I have
[23:18.460 --> 23:24.300]  a degree in horticulture. I'm from North Carolina, obviously. Uh, but back there I grew also, uh, it
[23:24.300 --> 23:30.540]  was organically, um, small scale, but yeah, I've been doing teas and soil mixes for a while.
[23:30.540 --> 23:36.940]  Uh, coming out here really opened my eyes to the fact that, you know, you think you're going to
[23:36.940 --> 23:41.500]  come out to Colorado. You think you're going to grow organics. You think it's this big popular
[23:41.500 --> 23:47.500]  thing, but it's all about money. Um, yeah, but you know, Jay, I met Jay, um, and then he had the
[23:47.500 --> 23:52.060]  high quality, these high quality castings. I've never turned back, met him probably within a
[23:52.060 --> 23:58.700]  month of being here. I've been using his castings ever since. Uh, he does all testings on his stuff.
[23:59.660 --> 24:03.660]  You know, it's super high quality and that's really posted some today actually. Yeah. And
[24:03.660 --> 24:09.420]  that's really the key to, uh, basically what I do is my castings. Um, and plain and simple,
[24:09.420 --> 24:14.060]  everybody wants to know how do I do it? It's Jace castings without a microbial inoculate,
[24:14.060 --> 24:20.700]  not microbial source. I couldn't do what I do. Um, a lot of people source, you know,
[24:20.700 --> 24:25.980]  wrigglers, then bat worm castings from stores. You know, you can make your own compost. It's
[24:25.980 --> 24:29.900]  probably the best way to do it. Your own worm castings is probably the best way to do it.
[24:29.900 --> 24:35.260]  But at the same time, a lot of people, I call it greenwashing. Um, they go out and they buy
[24:35.260 --> 24:41.660]  something because it looks organic or it looks like it's going to be all natural. Exactly. Like
[24:41.660 --> 24:47.340]  this, this environmental friendly product. And these companies are preying on the consumer just
[24:47.340 --> 24:53.260]  like they would in any other, you know, organic companies aren't any nicer than synthetic companies.
[24:53.260 --> 24:57.260]  Uh, there's a company right now, for example, that loves to kick out this,
[24:57.260 --> 25:01.580]  they throw numbers at people and you, uh, your average grower doesn't really understand
[25:02.140 --> 25:08.140]  how these work, but for example, like Jesse was saying, uh, Jay actually posted something earlier,
[25:08.780 --> 25:13.900]  um, about the worm castings. I'm sorry. I wanted to bring this up.
[25:13.900 --> 25:15.820]  No, check it out. Do your research. I like it.
[25:15.820 --> 25:21.580]  Um, but no, for example, so you've got a company out there who's throwing this number around like
[25:21.580 --> 25:29.900]  30,000 plus microbe, you know, living microbes in your tea and you can use it and multiply it. And
[25:29.900 --> 25:34.220]  you know, it sounds amazing. It really does. And then you read Jay's test and it's like, uh,
[25:35.100 --> 25:41.980]  6.9 million, uh, protozoa in one gram of material. So in one pound, that's over 3
[25:41.980 --> 25:47.340]  billion protozoa. And that's before you multiply it in your brewer. So to everybody out there
[25:47.340 --> 25:52.460]  that's using these, these products, you know, these sales pitches, uh, I'm sorry.
[25:53.100 --> 25:55.820]  They're selling you the shake. You're getting seeds and stems.
[25:55.820 --> 26:00.300]  Exactly. You know, you're, you think you're getting a leg up, but really you're paying
[26:00.300 --> 26:05.420]  for an overpriced press brewer and somebody to put stuff in a bag for you. That's all you're
[26:05.420 --> 26:08.620]  paying when the bottle is a lot like clothes. We're paying for the label. You're paying for
[26:08.620 --> 26:12.060]  that Nike symbol, that botanic care symbol, that advanced nutrients logo.
[26:12.060 --> 26:18.380]  Yeah. So shout out to Jay. He's doing it big and not only worm castings. Um, he can source a lot
[26:18.380 --> 26:24.780]  of things that, you know, grow stores can't get. Uh, Jesse can probably attend to that. There's a
[26:24.780 --> 26:29.900]  lot of things that, yeah, that's, they're just not going to be able to source. He approaches it a
[26:29.900 --> 26:34.460]  little differently. And you know, that's, that's cool. Yeah. And once you get to a certain scale,
[26:34.460 --> 26:40.460]  it's time to adjust from being a garage basement, addict grower to actually being a horticulturalist
[26:40.460 --> 26:44.780]  and setting up a grow and doing horticulture. That's kind of what it sounds like. That's what
[26:44.780 --> 26:50.620]  Jay's more aimed for. Yeah. So you got an email up there? Uh, yeah, he can get whatever you want.
[26:51.340 --> 26:55.660]  Yeah. I'm going to put an email in my, here's a weird question. I'm going to feed botanic care.
[26:55.660 --> 27:01.260]  Will it kill my name meal? If I put it in my soil before I mix? No, you got to, the only reason you
[27:01.260 --> 27:07.580]  really have to be careful mixing synthetics and organics is you can really throw off your micro
[27:07.580 --> 27:13.500]  herd. Um, you feed too much as something, your fungus is going to feed at a faster rate than
[27:13.500 --> 27:17.820]  your bacteria, which will kill your bacteria out. Then your fungus will actually start to pull
[27:17.820 --> 27:24.140]  things from the plant if it's not in the soil. So it's a balancing act. Uh, there's a couple of
[27:24.140 --> 27:29.100]  people I've seen on Instagram who are just absolutely killing the balancing act with the
[27:29.100 --> 27:34.620]  synthetics and organics. I would never recommend it to anybody. That's something we talked about
[27:34.620 --> 27:40.940]  in the last show is don't mix. Stay away. Unless you were just extremely well-versed in what you
[27:40.940 --> 27:46.780]  do. I would highly recommend staying away from running synthetics and organics at the same time.
[27:46.780 --> 27:53.900]  I know a guy that amends his, uh, uh, cocoa soil and he's running full blown, uh, uh,
[27:54.700 --> 27:59.020]  general hydroponics and all that. Yeah. These probiotic guys. Now I've seen a lot of them running
[27:59.020 --> 28:03.580]  cocoa, probiotic farmers alliance is getting crazy. It's killing me. I think everybody at this table
[28:03.580 --> 28:08.460]  knows there's one grower. He runs organics all the way until about week six. And then he starts just
[28:08.460 --> 28:13.820]  pummeling with like hammerhead and all kinds of ridiculous PGRs just to make them explode. And
[28:13.820 --> 28:19.020]  he said that gives it the flavor that's his, but you know, I'm just teaching them. Yeah. Yeah. That's
[28:19.020 --> 28:22.300]  his grow. He can do what he wants in there. Just don't sell it to me. I heard they didn't make that
[28:22.300 --> 28:27.820]  stuff anymore. You know, they don't, but I know it's called like Bushmaster or something. If you're
[28:29.180 --> 28:33.900]  there are two or three bottles on the shelf at hydro indoor growing supplies. If you use hammerhead
[28:33.900 --> 28:38.620]  did I, I don't use it anymore. I did use it in the past when I was a new grower, I tried every
[28:38.620 --> 28:43.740]  brand and I tried hammerhead. That shit made my buds larger. I'll say it. Uh, if you're an advanced
[28:43.740 --> 28:47.340]  nutrients grower or a hydro farmer, and you want to clean that shit off the shelf at Jesse shop,
[28:47.340 --> 28:53.740]  go get it. It's $107 a bottle. It's not that much. I'll make you do it for a whole bunch of advanced
[28:53.740 --> 28:59.180]  nutrients. There we go. Advance is on really good sale right now. I grow indoor growing supplies.
[28:59.180 --> 29:02.940]  So you listen to the agro culture show. Speaking of advanced, I had something written down. We've
[29:02.940 --> 29:06.780]  already gone a half hour guys with this show, maybe a little longer than an hour, if nobody minds.
[29:06.780 --> 29:12.220]  Um, why don't you guys, I'm going to take a dab and I'm going to, this is, I'm like, I'm starting
[29:12.220 --> 29:17.740]  to fight right now. Tell me a little bit about PGRs and how you feel about them. I'm going to,
[29:17.740 --> 29:21.900]  I'm going to jump in real quickly. PGR stands for plant growth regulator, you guys. And now I'm
[29:21.900 --> 29:26.780]  going to let Sean tell us about those while I take a dab. Uh, there's a time and place for everything,
[29:26.780 --> 29:35.420]  man. Um, not in my food crops, at least not, uh, synthetically made PGRs. There's obviously plenty
[29:35.420 --> 29:43.500]  of ways to use natural PGRs, plant hormones, uh, gibberellic acid, triacaninol, uh, gibberellic
[29:43.500 --> 29:49.500]  acid, gibberellic acid. You know, it goes on after the show. I got a buttload of that stuff.
[29:50.620 --> 29:55.340]  You know, alfalfa. I do raw alfalfa barley sprouts, barley sprouts,
[29:56.460 --> 30:00.860]  barley tea every two weeks on my veg plants. Yeah. I always actually alternate, uh,
[30:00.860 --> 30:05.820]  alfalfa and barley for veg and then corn and barley for flour. I haven't used corn yet,
[30:05.820 --> 30:13.740]  but that's just cause I haven't found a, I mean, I know, uh, 95% really cool. Organic. Yeah. Really?
[30:13.740 --> 30:20.700]  Really? Nice. It's not that expensive. Oh no, no. That's, um, I've been, yeah. Learning that,
[30:20.700 --> 30:26.060]  you know, a lot of cool little additives you don't find at growth stores. Although I'm going to start
[30:26.140 --> 30:32.140]  having ferments, ferments, ferments, ferments, like cold processed extractions. That's how you're
[30:32.140 --> 30:38.300]  going to get your natural PGRs. Um, fermented plant juices. Uh, basically you're going to
[30:38.300 --> 30:42.940]  collect growing nodes. Can you teach us what a PGR actually is? Kind of explain like what it is
[30:42.940 --> 30:49.180]  and what it does. Let's say like what a axiom. Are you familiar with that? Yeah. So explain that to
[30:49.500 --> 30:55.420]  So basically, uh, basically what a PGR is, is, uh, it controls the plant's growth. Um, so it
[30:55.420 --> 31:02.060]  contains either real or synthetic forms of plant hormones. Uh, and then it's going to make the
[31:02.060 --> 31:09.420]  plant react in a certain way, usually by triggering like apical dominance or stimulating the plants.
[31:09.420 --> 31:15.260]  S A R there's different ways that these PGRs can affect the plants, but for the most part,
[31:15.260 --> 31:20.620]  you're just applying it to the plant at a certain stage in its growth cycle to make it do what you
[31:20.620 --> 31:25.740]  want. You're just manipulating nature. So the most popular one, I think that a lot of us have
[31:25.740 --> 31:31.660]  used in the past would be snow storm, snow storm, ultra. Uh, it's basically, they've taken, I think
[31:31.660 --> 31:37.340]  it's sea kelp and other plant proteins and concentrated them. Uh, why don't I want to
[31:37.340 --> 31:41.180]  feed that to my plants? And I'm just being, I'm just trying to, so that we can get the listeners.
[31:41.340 --> 31:45.980]  The thing is, is a lot of those, I can't really tell you without looking at the bottle,
[31:45.980 --> 31:51.820]  what exactly is in it. But if you're telling me it's the kelp, um, me personally, my favorite
[31:51.820 --> 31:57.100]  flower hardener back when I used to use bottled organics was, uh, what is it? Mendo avalanche,
[31:57.100 --> 32:01.900]  Mendocino avalanche, um, which is basically two different types of kelp and molasses.
[32:02.620 --> 32:07.820]  So that I've actually kind of adapted that to my, so just replace the mold crap and use kelp.
[32:08.380 --> 32:15.260]  Just make the real deal. Natural, healthy PGRs versus exactly. And that goes right back into,
[32:15.260 --> 32:21.580]  uh, the fermented like plant juices extracts is the way to go. It's basically the same idea is
[32:21.580 --> 32:25.340]  if you want to, if a human wants to get ripped, you shouldn't go inject steroids and sit on the
[32:25.340 --> 32:30.060]  couch. You should go to the gym, eat protein, eat vegetables, get all the things you need and work
[32:30.060 --> 32:35.820]  out. Uh, we're not giving our plants a workout. We're feeding them, uh, energy bars and protein
[32:35.820 --> 32:40.140]  shakes and treating them like shit and expecting them to be fully healthy. We need balanced,
[32:40.140 --> 32:44.460]  healthy plants, not just, you know, they use these steroid boosted plants. They use PGRs.
[32:44.460 --> 32:49.980]  It's so funny. Like axiom is one of the best, uh, I've used lots of it, not on my personal stuff,
[32:49.980 --> 32:54.380]  but I've seen the results. No, just the idea of it is, you know, you're using this synthetic to
[32:54.380 --> 33:00.700]  stimulate the plants as they are, which what, what is it? It's a, is it systematic automated
[33:00.700 --> 33:05.180]  response that the first word might be off. I'm not even sure. Yeah, it's, it's some sort of
[33:05.180 --> 33:10.380]  automated response. Basically it's the plant's ability to protect itself. Um, and it's defense
[33:10.380 --> 33:16.060]  mode. That's the reason, you know, the plant produces resin is to protect itself basically.
[33:16.060 --> 33:21.260]  Uh, and that's kind of what axiom does is it stimulates that chain reaction inside of the
[33:21.260 --> 33:26.940]  plant. So it's going into defense mode. It's going to produce, it's exactly what it's doing is it's,
[33:26.940 --> 33:32.620]  uh, chemically stressing the plant. You have to be careful. Uh, you know, Jessica probably contended
[33:32.620 --> 33:37.100]  this when you're messing with gibberellic acid and stuff. I get a lot of Fox tailing, uh, when I
[33:37.100 --> 33:43.820]  kind of use it later into flower and that's usually with any PGR. Um, wasn't a gibberellic acid at one
[33:43.820 --> 33:50.380]  point was a choice for people creating from my seeds. Yeah. It makes them too stretchy. Really?
[33:50.380 --> 33:57.660]  Yeah. I've found, uh, uh, silver thiosulfate that I make myself is the best way for reversing. I was
[33:57.660 --> 34:01.260]  meeting some with some old heads this morning. They were talking about colloidal silver and
[34:01.260 --> 34:08.700]  cloning. Man, if you're going to reverse seeds, definitely make your own silver thiosulfate at
[34:08.700 --> 34:14.620]  home. It's really easy to do. Make everything at home. It's really easy to do. Yeah. And just,
[34:14.620 --> 34:18.380]  I mean, if we're not, if you guys, I'm going to kind of apologize. Also, if you live in an
[34:18.380 --> 34:23.180]  apartment, if you're a new grower, uh, if you're not, if you're not striving for what we are,
[34:23.180 --> 34:26.860]  don't, don't feel bad. Use your bottles, do what you can. If you're a medical patient and you don't
[34:26.860 --> 34:31.020]  have the physical ability to mix this shit up, we're not hating you. We're just recommending,
[34:31.020 --> 34:35.180]  we're encouraging this. No. And reach out to us. Cause we, we definitely have ways that we could
[34:35.180 --> 34:41.020]  help you. Um, you know, if you, if you live in an apartment, if you are unable to mix your soil
[34:41.020 --> 34:45.660]  and make your own teas, there are definitely options out there for you. Um, see that stuff
[34:45.660 --> 34:50.700]  community on the podcast. Yeah. Everybody deserves that. We'll get Jesse's awesome ass
[34:50.700 --> 34:54.460]  truck and we'll drive up the mountain and we'll come mix up soil in your yard for you and we'll
[34:54.460 --> 34:58.300]  put it in pots and we'll carry it in and hopefully you can get your wheelchair between the plants to
[34:58.300 --> 35:02.380]  water them. Yeah. I feel like people get you going. Yeah. But I think people kind of over
[35:02.380 --> 35:07.580]  complicate things with organics. Um, basically if you, if you want to grow organics or start
[35:07.580 --> 35:12.220]  growing organics, I'd recommend going and finding a nice and organic bottled line of nutrients,
[35:12.220 --> 35:17.660]  roots, organic, general organic age old, you know, the list goes on and on and they're
[35:18.780 --> 35:26.620]  bio-biz. That's pretty simple stuff. Yeah. They're a fish hydroslate is very good. Um,
[35:26.620 --> 35:33.020]  yeah, I used to use it when I was back in the dizzy, but, uh, anyways, uh, I'd recommend picking
[35:33.020 --> 35:38.780]  up a nice bottled organic nutrient line. Uh, then outside of that, go and get you some nice
[35:39.500 --> 35:45.100]  Rocky Mount worm casting style worm castings. Uh, they, the quality is extremely important.
[35:45.100 --> 35:51.420]  I cannot stress that enough. Um, find high quality worm castings or find a high quality
[35:51.420 --> 35:59.020]  microbial source. Um, and then molasses, there's your compost tea. Sean is pretty much, uh, uh,
[35:59.020 --> 36:03.580]  describing the, uh, the way I grow. Yeah. We're supposed to call him something different the whole
[36:03.580 --> 36:10.540]  time. That's, that's basically the way I grow inside. And, uh, I can promise you,
[36:11.260 --> 36:17.660]  you get stellar results and it's, um, you know, it's way better than hydro. That's for damn sure.
[36:17.660 --> 36:22.780]  I mean, you're just replacing, uh, you know, synthetics have chelates. Um, and that's kind
[36:22.780 --> 36:29.180]  of the idea of using the tea with your organic bottled nutrient is when you feed with your,
[36:29.180 --> 36:33.100]  when you feed with the nutrient, you're putting it in the soil. When you're feeding with your tea,
[36:33.660 --> 36:37.900]  you're activating that soil to help it eat those nutrients, to give it back into your plan.
[36:37.900 --> 36:41.180]  That's a really good way to put that. It's a great way to, so if you're, if you're growing
[36:41.180 --> 36:46.620]  with bottled organic nutrients and you're not using a tea of some, some sort of microbial
[36:46.620 --> 36:50.380]  source, you're, you're just hurting yourself. Plain and simple. I have a couple of questions
[36:50.380 --> 36:55.900]  written down for you and stuff. Will you give us a quick run through, um, five gallon bucket on how
[36:55.900 --> 37:00.140]  to make a nice Jesse's done this for us, but we tell us how to make a nice microbial tea for
[37:00.140 --> 37:04.700]  just to start off with that we can use almost any time. Okay. So, uh, yeah, without a doubt,
[37:04.700 --> 37:12.380]  a worm castings and molasses, if you can't get anything else, just those two. Um, and there's
[37:12.380 --> 37:17.500]  your microbial source and there's a food for it, uh, depending on your quality of castings,
[37:17.500 --> 37:21.900]  a fourth of cup per gallon, uh, molasses, depending on how often you're using it,
[37:21.900 --> 37:28.300]  one teaspoon to one tablespoon per gallon. Um, outside of that, kelp meal is always a good one.
[37:28.300 --> 37:32.220]  Uh, kelp meal. I mean, if you're not familiar with the benefits of kelp, you should really
[37:32.220 --> 37:39.180]  look it up. Plenty of plant hormones. There's a decent MPK value in there. Um, and then really
[37:39.180 --> 37:44.140]  go crazy, uh, just molasses, earthworm castings. Then you can go into kelp. You can go into
[37:44.140 --> 37:48.860]  alfalfa depending on, you know, veg, flour, that's how you're going to kind of deliver
[37:48.860 --> 37:54.940]  more of an MPK value to your plant. Um, do you agree with the revs, uh, the revs book,
[37:55.020 --> 38:00.540]  uh, true living organics? You know, I shout out to the rev. I read his book, uh, you know,
[38:00.540 --> 38:07.260]  the rev sub I grew up learning organics just like everybody else did. And I really don't agree with
[38:07.260 --> 38:12.300]  his stuff on four. I mean, it's, but I learned everything that I know now from his book. You
[38:12.300 --> 38:17.740]  know, it's, if it, if I wouldn't have went through that trial, I wouldn't be where I am today. So I
[38:17.740 --> 38:21.740]  can't be mad at him. You just have to work, learn what works for you. I know people who have used
[38:21.740 --> 38:27.020]  his stuff with great success. Okay. So he's not saying to skip it. No, definitely. You want to
[38:27.020 --> 38:32.060]  read that book. I've seen some people crush it and have amazing buds with super soil. And I've
[38:32.060 --> 38:37.180]  seen other people have burnt up shitty buds with super soil. So it's kind of, it's how you grow.
[38:38.140 --> 38:43.660]  People, you know, it's people are really funny about organics. Uh, we, even with my Rocky
[38:43.660 --> 38:47.980]  Mount natural farming page, we kind of had to take a break with posts for a while. Um,
[38:47.980 --> 38:53.820]  we like to put in for informative posts up trying to help the community, but, uh, we're
[38:53.820 --> 38:58.380]  met with a lot of defiance. Oh, as soon as you put up, I quit posting a lot of stuff on Facebook
[38:58.380 --> 39:02.300]  because as soon as you put up a helpful thing, 10 people tell you why you're stupid. Exactly.
[39:02.300 --> 39:07.820]  And you know, to each his own. You don't have to agree with the way I grew up. You know, I,
[39:07.820 --> 39:13.100]  even if I say something wrong, sure. I mean, it's a lot easier for you to focus on one point. I got
[39:13.100 --> 39:18.140]  a lot of stuff I got to remember. I've actually made mistakes on this podcast and I felt proud
[39:18.140 --> 39:22.700]  to come back and say, Hey guys, last week I told you the wrong way. I'm sorry. Like Jesse called
[39:22.700 --> 39:28.140]  me. He's like, you just said this. Oh shit. I did say that. But I feel like people are getting too
[39:28.140 --> 39:33.900]  caught up in, uh, this growing style or that growing style or he grows like this or they grow
[39:33.900 --> 39:40.140]  like that. And it just, people need to choose their own information. It's amateurish in my
[39:40.140 --> 39:45.820]  opinion. Exactly. Bro science. All three of us, all three of us grow different ways. You don't
[39:45.820 --> 39:50.780]  see us fight like children, you know, we all, but we all borrow something from each other. I'm sure
[39:50.780 --> 39:53.900]  you've learned something and you've learned something from me and I've learned five things
[39:53.900 --> 39:59.660]  from you and five from you. We're all still doing the same thing. I love talking to synthetic
[39:59.660 --> 40:05.020]  growers. Um, I've, I've never grown marijuana synthetically. Uh, my background is in commercial
[40:05.020 --> 40:12.220]  agriculture. I've grown millions and millions of GMO, horrible, horrible synthetic plants. Um,
[40:12.220 --> 40:16.300]  I'm not proud of it. Food crops, food crops. Yeah. All edible food. I mean, you can look on
[40:16.300 --> 40:21.980]  my Instagram and see him. Okay. Oh yeah. Uh, thousands. We was 30 acres of glass greenhouses.
[40:21.980 --> 40:27.740]  We were running, um, people got to eat, but you know, there's a certain point in time that you've
[40:27.740 --> 40:32.780]  got to kind of figure out what means more to you. Is it your money or your morals? Yeah. I walked
[40:32.780 --> 40:38.940]  away from making $45,000 a year, which is, you know, it's a good bit for me as a student loans,
[40:38.940 --> 40:44.380]  man. But, uh, no, you know, I walked away from that and got a part-time job here in town working
[40:44.380 --> 40:49.900]  at a hydro store and just grew because, you know, it's, that's what I wanted to do. And I couldn't,
[40:49.900 --> 40:52.220]  it's a lot easier to wake up and look at yourself in the mirror.
[40:53.420 --> 40:57.340]  That's why I started a seed company because I got tired. Well, that's, that's kind of what led to
[40:57.340 --> 41:01.580]  it, but that's how I ended up self-employed. I don't want to work for somebody all day for
[41:01.580 --> 41:07.580]  something I don't support for a minimum wage and hate myself. I'd rather be kind of struggling and
[41:07.580 --> 41:12.460]  really happy and have a cool job and have a cool job. And I've got everything I want. I got a cool
[41:12.460 --> 41:16.860]  ass girlfriend. I can do what I want. I got a seed company if I, and I'm not rich. I think if I were
[41:16.860 --> 41:20.460]  rich, I'd just be depressed and confused on all this money. And I wouldn't know if you guys were
[41:20.460 --> 41:24.140]  my friends because I'm rich or because you guys are cool as shit. And we're brothers. I'd be like,
[41:24.140 --> 41:27.580]  do these guys just want to come smoke on my live resin? Cause I've got an ounce of it in my pocket.
[41:27.740 --> 41:33.180]  I think I've got, we're, we're our rich. We're rich this way because we make, we make the,
[41:33.180 --> 41:37.260]  we know that we're not poisoning people. We're growing a quality product. We're contributing.
[41:37.260 --> 41:41.100]  We're moving it forward. We're making the cannabis a good thing instead of a scary thing.
[41:41.740 --> 41:49.340]  I walked away from a $25 an hour job. Well, they asked me to leave, but I walked away.
[41:49.580 --> 41:55.980]  Stomped your feet away. They actually told me I had to quit smoking weed and I said no. So,
[41:57.180 --> 42:00.940]  but yeah, that's a lot of people will tell you that that's way happier, but you have to choose
[42:00.940 --> 42:05.420]  the decisions that make, yeah. Happiness over money is way important. I don't drink a fifth
[42:05.420 --> 42:10.700]  of whiskey every night now. Oh man. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to sobriety. I haven't had alcohol in
[42:10.700 --> 42:15.420]  a long time. I'm not a drinker either. I still enjoy beer, but I don't know if I'm really,
[42:15.420 --> 42:19.820]  really good at drinking or really, really bad at it. I'm not sure which one it is, but either way,
[42:19.820 --> 42:25.580]  I'm not a big person as you can tell, like one beer wasted. Wow. Biggest lightweight. Now I bet
[42:25.580 --> 42:30.700]  you two beers would crush me now. Yeah. I'd be silly sitting in the corner. Uh, let's see. I
[42:30.700 --> 42:35.100]  wanted, uh, you kind of told me earlier, what is your average harvest weight per thousand watt
[42:35.100 --> 42:42.060]  light running your organics? Um, you know, it varies. So last round we ran with the kind of
[42:42.060 --> 42:46.860]  like the style Jesse was talking about, uh, with the, just a bottled nutrient kind of,
[42:46.860 --> 42:54.540]  or a bottled organic supplemented with teas. We were hitting around, I say 1.7 pounds per light.
[42:55.100 --> 43:01.500]  Um, this organics guys, this last grow, um, which is what I brought you today was grown with no
[43:01.500 --> 43:07.740]  bottled nutrients. Absolutely none. I mean, this is all fruit juices, plant juices, the calcium.
[43:07.740 --> 43:13.740]  And I think I probably run a pretty mild soil too compared to like TLO or super slow. I don't,
[43:13.740 --> 43:20.460]  I really, uh, go light on my soil mix. I think over mending is a big problem. Really impressed
[43:20.460 --> 43:25.260]  me about that jar you got there is that I know your, your soil mix is almost minimal. So I'm
[43:25.260 --> 43:31.260]  holding the butt up to the microphone, but it's not loud enough. But, uh, yeah, so we hit, uh,
[43:31.260 --> 43:36.540]  I hit probably 1.2. I'm not done pulling yet. I'll text you the final weight and you can throw it up
[43:36.540 --> 43:41.740]  on a later show. But yes, right now I'm kind of looking at 1.2, but that's with no bottled
[43:41.740 --> 43:46.620]  nutrients. Um, and these are new strains that I'm running this round. So do you have it on that? Do
[43:46.620 --> 43:51.740]  you have a favorite strain to grow? Um, you know, I'm still so, I still feel so like new to the
[43:51.740 --> 43:56.940]  growing game. Um, you know, growing back East and kind of growing what you have to, you get out here
[43:56.940 --> 44:02.540]  and, you know, so I guess flow would probably be my favorite strain. That's a great, she loves to
[44:02.540 --> 44:07.980]  take good pictures too. Um, outside of the flow Citrix, I think we were talking about that earlier.
[44:07.980 --> 44:14.620]  That one is definitely going to be in the garden for a long, long time. Uh, yeah. Outside of that,
[44:14.620 --> 44:18.380]  I've grown, I've had a pleasure to grow on some of your gear. I've grown the grateful dog, the heart
[44:18.380 --> 44:25.900]  of gold, and Jeffrey. I think the heart of gold was my personal favorite. Um, it was racy to say
[44:25.900 --> 44:30.700]  the least. I mean, it's, it's not like you wake up in the middle of the night and you accidentally
[44:30.700 --> 44:36.220]  grab that to put you back to sleep. You fucked up. You're not going back to sleep. No, not at all.
[44:37.100 --> 44:41.660]  That's the golden goat in there. The golden goat is definitely Sativa heavy. Um, I wish I had taken
[44:41.660 --> 44:47.180]  it like a week longer than I, how long did you let it go? Uh, I think I cut it at like nine.
[44:47.180 --> 44:50.620]  Okay. Yeah. That's good to know. So yeah, I think about 10 weeks is usually what I recommend.
[44:51.980 --> 44:59.660]  I took once at 76, 77 days once. Nice. I think probably 72 as far as I go.
[45:00.540 --> 45:06.380]  So DJ shorts been preaching this 1113 light cycle. So I tried it. Oh man. Sean had a reaction right
[45:06.380 --> 45:09.660]  away. I'm glad I decided to go that route. I had a couple of things written down a couple of ways
[45:09.660 --> 45:14.460]  to go. So I'm glad I went that way. Um, I'll tell you my experience, but what did you think about it?
[45:15.660 --> 45:19.980]  Confusion, man. I just, a little bit of information is a dangerous thing.
[45:22.620 --> 45:28.140]  That's all I have to say about it. Uh, I see, I was saying, I see more expression.
[45:28.140 --> 45:34.300]  The plants showed more color. Um, a Sativa strain that has never really Fox tailed on me
[45:34.300 --> 45:40.060]  kind of made fingery buds. Um, I got a lot of color. I keep saying that the color was tremendous
[45:40.060 --> 45:46.460]  on this run, but I feel like it lowered my harvest weight by somewhere between 10 and 20%. I'm not,
[45:46.460 --> 45:50.380]  I haven't cut everything down yet. I've got more to go, but I can tell it diminished my harvest.
[45:50.380 --> 45:54.300]  That may have been from the cold, but I really think it was from that light cycle. I felt the
[45:54.300 --> 45:59.660]  same thing about it. Yeah. Yeah. We always preach it. The most important nutrient to our plants is
[45:59.660 --> 46:06.300]  the light. And so we took a full hour and that's, we took 63 hours, 65 hours away from our plants,
[46:06.300 --> 46:12.620]  honestly. Yeah. And one thing I did notice they finished quickly. Uh, I probably saved two weeks
[46:12.620 --> 46:16.540]  on some of my 10 or 11 week strains. They're going to finish week nine and there'll be done. I,
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.540]  I'm worried to let them go too long. One may Herm out. I can see it kind of getting
[46:20.540 --> 46:24.220]  it's pissy. It's like, you got to cut me down. Yeah. Which is cool. I'll cut her,
[46:24.220 --> 46:30.460]  but I just wasn't ready. It's a, it's a neat tool in a breeding aspect. Um, you know,
[46:30.460 --> 46:35.100]  if we were tested across, we had made, if you're looking for Fino, if you're Fino hunting, that is
[46:35.100 --> 46:39.580]  a good point, but that's probably the only time I'll use it again. But like you hear that you've
[46:39.580 --> 46:45.020]  got growers and advanced breeders and people talking about this. So just please don't try this
[46:45.660 --> 46:50.860]  Yeah. I mean, yeah, there's no need for you to do it on your day to day crop. Stick with 12,
[46:50.860 --> 46:54.940]  12. You guys stick with 12, 12. If you want to get adventurous, if you're a, if you're kind of
[46:54.940 --> 46:59.100]  advanced, do what you want to do. I don't, I don't, I don't want to hold anybody back,
[46:59.100 --> 47:02.940]  but be responsible. Cause if you do go and Herm out that crop, you got to do something with that
[47:02.940 --> 47:07.500]  Herm dot crop and don't go try to, you did not just make a seed company. You're not called Calypso
[47:08.460 --> 47:15.980]  seeds. Mids. Hashtag bigger lover smokes mids. But if you, if you Herm your crop,
[47:15.980 --> 47:19.500]  you did just not make a seed company. You made a mistake. You got to get those seeds out of there,
[47:19.500 --> 47:23.500]  grow them, grow them yourself. Give them to your friend. Give free. Those are free seeds. That
[47:23.500 --> 47:27.260]  shit is free. Those are the seeds you give to your friends. You warn them. These are from her.
[47:27.260 --> 47:32.300]  And then you'll understand hopefully what were, you know, all the breeders are bitching about.
[47:32.380 --> 47:38.620]  Yeah. Yeah. Sean, I'm just picking on you. No, sorry. There's another guy named Sean figure
[47:38.620 --> 47:42.780]  lover. His name is Sean also. Oh yeah. Yeah. I didn't know. That's what his, I see. I don't
[47:42.780 --> 47:48.780]  know if I should even say guys. Yeah. Whatever. He posted a picture of himself today. Did you,
[47:48.780 --> 47:53.500]  I don't even know what he looks like. He's been apparently, it was like seven years or 15 years,
[47:53.500 --> 48:01.020]  the GMOs or something. He posted the guys and not shut up. Yo his cats, yo, that is, that is wild.
[48:01.020 --> 48:05.580]  Yeah. It's not, that is crazy. You know, when you, somebody standing next to you and you're
[48:06.300 --> 48:10.620]  Instagram feed and then you hit vigorous page of a cat taking a shit in the toilet.
[48:12.460 --> 48:17.100]  So our buddy vigor lover trained to kitties, adorable kitties. If you're a cat guy,
[48:17.100 --> 48:21.740]  he trained these kitties to full on, take a shit in the toilet like a human. And they drew it.
[48:21.740 --> 48:27.660]  But the only thing is he posts a video of it every day. Like I've seen more cat butthole
[48:27.660 --> 48:31.820]  on his feed than I have plants lately. It's kind of weird. Shout out to vigor lover, dude.
[48:31.820 --> 48:33.820]  Hey, start tagging that I reach genetics.
[48:36.300 --> 48:40.540]  Yeah. Cats pooping hashtag I read genetics. I like it. Thanks a lot. I like that.
[48:41.660 --> 48:44.860]  Guys. We've got about 10 minutes to go. I don't want to start. We're going to have Sean back
[48:44.860 --> 48:47.660]  because we've got more stuff to talk about. I don't want to start another long rant because
[48:47.660 --> 48:50.780]  we get them going. Do you guys have any plugs or shout outs or anything you want to do? People
[48:50.780 --> 48:55.980]  you want to say thanks to just a Rocky Mount worm company. I can't give enough. Thanks to
[48:56.700 --> 49:02.300]  father. Do they have an Instagram or anything? Do Rocky Mount worm company, uh, check them out.
[49:02.300 --> 49:08.460]  They've got a Facebook page. So that's where all the cool kids are on these days. Uh, they've also
[49:08.460 --> 49:14.700]  got a website, uh, Rocky Mount worm company.com. And then they ship all over the country to high
[49:14.700 --> 49:19.260]  quality. Yeah. I know. I happen to know a high quality nutrient company that smuggles the stuff
[49:19.260 --> 49:27.260]  into Canada. You know, just be thankful that you, if you live in Colorado, go and get the damn
[49:27.260 --> 49:32.300]  castings because there's people out there who just want them so bad and just can't afford the
[49:32.300 --> 49:37.980]  shipping or they don't have access to them. Uh, it's just such an underutilized thing here in town.
[49:37.980 --> 49:41.260]  And it doesn't sound like you need a whole bunch. You said like a quarter cup. Yeah. I mean,
[49:41.260 --> 49:45.900]  most people are putting in a cup per gallon, these outrageous rates, and you can use a fourth of cup.
[49:45.900 --> 49:51.900]  I mean, you have five to 10% cutting into your soil mixes just more than enough. And I use like
[49:51.900 --> 49:57.180]  80 pounds of it on my six outdoor plants. Yeah. And you guys will notice a huge difference. Uh,
[49:57.180 --> 50:00.780]  grow a clone, grow two clones, keep them in cups for like three weeks, you know, until they're
[50:00.780 --> 50:05.660]  starting to get root bound to where they're pissed off root bound, uh, feed one consistently with
[50:05.660 --> 50:09.980]  your microbial tea with the worm castings in it. Don't add that to your other one when you feed it
[50:09.980 --> 50:15.420]  and pull them out of the cup and watch, you'll have thicker fingery dank, happy roots on one.
[50:15.420 --> 50:19.420]  And the other one you'll have these thin angel hair, pasta, whiskey, shitty, sad roots. If you
[50:19.420 --> 50:27.340]  mulch the one that you're giving the micro mobile, Jesus tripped on that word. Um, if you put some
[50:27.340 --> 50:32.700]  mulch on there, you'll see some really cool shit happen. So try it. Nice. Yeah. You see some fun
[50:32.700 --> 50:37.740]  or just a plastic cover, some fungus among us. Uh, Hey, uh, where do we find you on Instagram?
[50:38.460 --> 50:42.940]  King Cola. Nice King underscore Cola. Follow them on there guys. King,
[50:43.900 --> 50:49.020]  Rocky mountain, natural farming. Uh, you can link through that on my Instagram or Jay's Instagram,
[50:49.020 --> 50:53.420]  Rocky mountain worm company. Do you have a store opening soon? I hear something about that. Well,
[50:53.420 --> 50:59.980]  we have a shop up in Colorado Springs for 11, a four 11, a Tijuana street in Colorado Springs.
[50:59.980 --> 51:03.900]  You can come and check us out, uh, see the worm operation, check it out for yourself.
[51:03.900 --> 51:10.540]  If you got any questions, you know, just come and ask. Nice, nice. Jesse got any plugs, any shoutouts?
[51:10.940 --> 51:16.780]  Uh, Jesse grows Instagram. Say hi to your wife, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Hey baby.
[51:17.900 --> 51:21.660]  Bird. I hope you're listening to the agriculture podcast. I hope you're playing it in the store.
[51:21.660 --> 51:25.020]  Play the show in the store. That'd be really cool. I keep telling her too. She's like,
[51:25.020 --> 51:29.980]  I've already heard it. Yeah, I did that. Oh God. I could edit that out.
[51:31.100 --> 51:37.020]  That's okay. When is the next growers meeting? Um, I think we might be skipping December,
[51:37.660 --> 51:43.500]  Christmas and New Year's and everything. Lack of a heater, but, uh, Oh, it is cold back there. Yeah.
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.900]  Okay. But we're getting one. Yeah. Sounds good. We'll take December off. Make sure I make it to
[51:47.900 --> 51:53.260]  this one for sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, me and Sean have talked about some, uh, cool demos that he
[51:53.260 --> 51:58.700]  might come and help us with. Tell Jesse you want to learn some natural farming to hit me up. Yeah.
[51:58.700 --> 52:05.020]  Let's uh, let's get this going. I'd love to stock more of this stuff in, um, to get rid of, uh,
[52:05.020 --> 52:09.020]  one of those things we talked about earlier. I got a whole bunch of shelf space. So
[52:09.020 --> 52:16.540]  help him help you make your own. Some synthetic grower in California or wherever you are. Hit me
[52:16.540 --> 52:21.500]  up, dude. I'll, I'll sell you all that advanced. Help us get some organic stuff on the shelf that
[52:21.500 --> 52:26.860]  you don't care about. Yeah. He'll give you a discount on it. Uh, finish out your grow and
[52:26.860 --> 52:34.700]  then I'll help you go organics next round. Can they get commercial pricing? They'll get way
[52:34.700 --> 52:39.820]  better than commercial pricing. You can't buy it all. All right. I guess, uh, I gotta give one
[52:39.820 --> 52:45.020]  more shout out. I skipped one earlier. I need to give a big shout out to Robert and Vegas and Craig
[52:45.020 --> 52:50.940]  from the spot. Also Angela. What's up from the spot. Also just Angela in general, but those kids
[52:50.940 --> 52:55.420]  from the spot, all those guys from the spot and the spot dispensary in Pueblo West, huge shout
[52:55.420 --> 53:03.020]  out, much respect. Some things are coming up in the future. That's cool. I got a shop opening soon
[53:03.020 --> 53:09.180]  too. So I can't say any names yet though. Lots of stuff going on. Yeah. I see all the work that
[53:09.180 --> 53:14.140]  this community has put in is starting to pay off for all of us. Finally, some quality meds,
[53:14.140 --> 53:18.620]  hopefully down here in Pueblo. It's about time. All right guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[53:18.620 --> 53:22.700]  Make sure you follow me on Instagram. It's I read genetics on Instagram. Make sure you follow the
[53:22.700 --> 53:27.180]  show. It's I grow culture. So we'll read this part. Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes or
[53:27.180 --> 53:31.180]  stitcher, go to the iTunes or stitcher main page, search for the agriculture podcast. Find that
[53:31.180 --> 53:35.020]  review section. Give me a five star rating. Honestly, you can give me as many stars as you
[53:35.020 --> 53:38.940]  feel. I believe I just want that five. If you can help us move up in the ranks, more people listen
[53:38.940 --> 53:42.380]  to the show. The more people that listen to the show, the more people that grow organics, more
[53:42.380 --> 53:46.380]  people that grow organics, the more organics you have to smoke. The more people that are smoking
[53:46.380 --> 53:49.900]  organics, more people want more people to grow organics. More people start growing weed. The
[53:49.900 --> 53:54.060]  more people grow organic weed, the more we outgrow overgrow the government. The more we legalize
[53:54.060 --> 53:58.780]  cannabis, the more people listen to my podcast, repeat and grow your own food in there too. I want
[53:58.780 --> 54:03.820]  that on a shirt. All of that that I just said printed on the front of a shirt and then repeat
[54:03.820 --> 54:07.340]  and then write it on the back again and then just spin around and just have somebody keep more trees,
[54:07.340 --> 54:13.740]  less assholes. Someone really famous said that, but I can't remember their name or what they did.
[54:13.740 --> 54:17.820]  I wonder why they have a cool. Hey, I want to congratulate Jesse for making it all the way
[54:17.820 --> 54:23.900]  through this episode. I took like a whole bunch of dabs too. So you did a couple of you guys didn't
[54:23.900 --> 54:28.220]  even hear. He took a little nap on the couch last time. It was cute. All right. Great. Now guys,

[54:57.980 --> 55:01.580]  get Spence here. Jess may be here also. Man, thank you guys for taking time out of your day
[55:01.580 --> 55:05.740]  to come. We're all busy growers. It's great to get all three of us met here. Everybody was on time.
[55:06.300 --> 55:11.500]  Yeah. It was freaking crazy. Dude, you were on time. That coffee stop counts as you were still
[55:11.500 --> 55:15.820]  on time even after that in our world. It was awesome. All right. So until next time, guys,
[55:15.820 --> 55:20.140]  shout out to my ninja Spence. Thanks for listening. Take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me.
[55:28.940 --> 55:35.020]  The land from Japan. I got to thank the Lord up above.
[55:43.100 --> 55:48.220]  What's it like living my life? Rocking mics every night. Smoking purple and white is tight.
[55:48.220 --> 55:51.820]  I can't lie. I'm loving how I'm living since birth. I've been giving ambition.
[55:51.820 --> 55:52.860]  Plus, they get to spit.
