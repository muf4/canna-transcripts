[00:00.000 --> 00:02.260]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.260 --> 00:06.020]  It's time for episode 374 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.020 --> 00:09.320]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.320 --> 00:13.660]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.660 --> 00:19.620]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.620 --> 00:22.940]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:22.940 --> 00:26.740]  I just took a gigantic dab of Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[00:26.740 --> 00:33.480]  The label says it has 71.1% THC and a total of 85.7% cannabinoids.
[00:33.480 --> 00:36.340]  It does not have much more information on the label here.
[00:36.340 --> 00:39.620]  This came from our friends at Apothecary Farms in Pueblo.
[00:39.620 --> 00:43.180]  That's right, Apothecary has recently opened a Pueblo location, so make sure you check
[00:43.180 --> 00:44.180]  that out.
[00:44.180 --> 00:46.900]  But today I picked up the Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[00:46.900 --> 00:49.520]  I think it is sour diesel and clementine.
[00:49.520 --> 00:57.240]  It's got a really sweet, delicious, orangey, citrusy, clementine aroma, followed by a funky,
[00:57.240 --> 01:00.600]  sour diesel-y, just nasty aroma in the background.
[01:00.600 --> 01:02.720]  And I say nasty, but I mean it in the best way.
[01:02.720 --> 01:03.720]  It is delicious.
[01:03.720 --> 01:04.720]  It is pungent.
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.140]  So it's a little sweet, it's a little sour, and then when you dab it, it goes straight
[01:08.140 --> 01:09.140]  to the brain.
[01:09.140 --> 01:10.360]  It makes your eyes open wide up.
[01:10.360 --> 01:11.360]  It makes you talk a lot.
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.400]  It makes you real rambly.
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.840]  So I think this will be great podcast dabs.
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.040]  Shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms and an extra big shout out to the Pueblo crew.
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.280]  I'm really digging this batch of Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[01:22.280 --> 01:25.080]  All right, you guys, let's jump into a podcast.
[01:25.080 --> 01:27.200]  I want to do another grow lesson.
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.440]  I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:29.440 --> 01:33.960]  If you're a new listener, I suggest you go back to at least episode 351 and start on
[01:33.960 --> 01:35.600]  the grow lesson series.
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.400]  If you feel like you're caught up, welcome to the grow lessons.
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.600]  Today we are going to do a before flower checkup.
[01:42.600 --> 01:46.400]  So far in my grow lessons, we should have healthy, happy veg plants that are in their
[01:46.400 --> 01:48.080]  final finishing pots.
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.480]  I suggested three, five or seven gallon pots.
[01:50.480 --> 01:52.480]  If you want to go larger, you do it your way.
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.200]  It is your grow.
[01:54.200 --> 01:55.360]  Hopefully you've topped these plants.
[01:55.360 --> 01:56.880]  You've got a nice canopy going.
[01:56.880 --> 01:59.600]  Hopefully you've got a big fat, healthy root system going.
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.680]  We're aiming for healthy, happy plants that are thriving.
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.440]  Hopefully we don't have any bugs.
[02:04.440 --> 02:06.240]  Hopefully you haven't over fertilized.
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.800]  Hopefully you haven't had any pH issues.
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.240]  Hopefully we haven't had any environmental problems that we didn't expect.
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.380]  Hopefully everything's going well and you've got big, fat, healthy plants that are almost
[02:16.380 --> 02:17.380]  ready to flower.
[02:17.380 --> 02:21.040]  They're probably about knee high at this point, maybe a little bit taller depending on what
[02:21.040 --> 02:24.800]  kind of lights you're using, what kind of genetics you're working with, how often you've
[02:24.800 --> 02:28.040]  been feeding them, what kind of treatment you've been giving them.
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.280]  Our plants are probably getting large enough to consider putting them into flower very
[02:32.280 --> 02:33.280]  soon.
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.200]  Before we go into flower, I feel like there are a few important points we should cover.
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.000]  So let's go over my before flower checkup.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.600]  As it gets close to flower time, one of the first things I think about is, do I have clones?
[02:46.600 --> 02:48.040]  Do you have clones for the next run?
[02:48.040 --> 02:49.720]  Do you want to be self-sufficient?
[02:49.720 --> 02:55.960]  If so, you need to create clones for your next run before you put your plants into flower.
[02:55.960 --> 02:59.040]  I don't recommend taking clones from flowering plants.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.040]  Some people will do it.
[03:00.040 --> 03:01.400]  Some people will teach you how to do it.
[03:01.400 --> 03:02.600]  That is not my style.
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.640]  I highly recommend that you get your clones from your vegging plants.
[03:06.640 --> 03:09.760]  So before you put your plants into flower, do you have clones?
[03:09.920 --> 03:12.880]  Do you have a way to supply plants for your next cycle?
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.840]  If you plan on growing from seed again, or if you plan on purchasing new clones from
[03:16.840 --> 03:20.640]  a friend or a dispensary or however you get your clones, that's cool.
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.840]  If you're trying to be self-sufficient, now is the time to think about making clones from
[03:24.840 --> 03:26.720]  your current plants.
[03:26.720 --> 03:30.760]  Now if you decide that you want to be self-sufficient, you've got a couple of options.
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.600]  You may want to designate one of your clones as a mother plant.
[03:34.600 --> 03:36.600]  Here's the idea behind a mother plant.
[03:36.600 --> 03:42.360]  A mother plant is a clone of a plant that we have grown and tested and we know is reliable.
[03:42.360 --> 03:44.040]  We know that that plant is a female.
[03:44.040 --> 03:45.840]  We know that it puts off a good harvest weight.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.840]  We know that it is potent.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.200]  We know that it tastes good.
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.040]  And we hopefully have learned that it is pathogen and pest resistant.
[03:52.040 --> 03:55.680]  So we've got a reliable strain that we want to keep around in the garden.
[03:55.680 --> 03:59.760]  And the way we do that is just by keeping it in a vegetative stage perpetually.
[03:59.760 --> 04:02.200]  And then we can take clones from it as needed.
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.120]  The way you keep that mother plant in a vegetative stage is by leaving it under at least 18 hours
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.400]  of light every day for mother plants.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.880]  Sometimes I would recommend 20 on and 4 off.
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.040]  Maybe for stubborn mother plants, I may even go all the way up to 24 hours on.
[04:16.040 --> 04:19.160]  We've talked a little bit about that in previous episodes.
[04:19.160 --> 04:21.760]  I've also done a full episode about mother plants.
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.440]  I suggest you check out episode 315 for a full breakdown of mother plants.
[04:27.440 --> 04:31.080]  Now if you don't have room and space for an extra plant, maybe you just can't have that
[04:31.080 --> 04:34.440]  extra plant because of your plant count, because of state laws.
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.760]  Another option is to clone off of your veg plants perpetually.
[04:38.760 --> 04:42.880]  A lot of people will say that will create something we used to call genetic drift.
[04:42.880 --> 04:44.080]  I do not believe in that.
[04:44.080 --> 04:47.840]  If the plants are healthy, I've done a full episode on that as well.
[04:47.840 --> 04:48.840]  Let's get back on track.
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.600]  The idea of taking clones from your veg plants is very simple.
[04:52.600 --> 04:53.800]  You've got veg plants.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.440]  They're about to go into flower.
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.080]  Right before you take them into the flower room, take a couple of clones off of each
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.640]  of your veg plants.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.800]  If you have faith in your clone taking skills and you don't have room for an extra mother
[05:04.800 --> 05:07.120]  plant, this is an ideal way to do things.
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.120]  Again, some people may claim that this will result in genetic drift.
[05:11.120 --> 05:13.280]  I do not believe in genetic drift.
[05:13.280 --> 05:17.800]  I don't believe in it so much that I have changed my vocabulary to where I call what
[05:17.800 --> 05:21.280]  is known as genetic drift to regenerative mutation.
[05:21.280 --> 05:23.600]  I've done a full episode on genetic drift.
[05:23.600 --> 05:27.200]  If you'd like to learn more about it, I recommend you listen to the episode.
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.600]  That's episode number 343 and it's actually titled genetic drift.
[05:30.600 --> 05:36.320]  I suggest you give it a listen and understand why we now call it regenerative mutation.
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.520]  The point of that rant is to make sure that you have got clones for your next run.
[05:40.520 --> 05:44.760]  If you don't have a supplier, a provider, or a source for your next batch of clones,
[05:44.760 --> 05:49.000]  it may be really advantageous to take a few clones, start vegging them out so that way
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.080]  you've got another crop lined up before you even have this one finished.
[05:53.080 --> 05:56.640]  If you really want to max productivity of your grow, you'll start running what is known
[05:56.640 --> 05:59.160]  as a perpetual grow where you use two spaces.
[05:59.160 --> 06:00.160]  You've got a veg space.
[06:00.160 --> 06:01.640]  You've got a flowering space.
[06:01.640 --> 06:06.160]  As soon as that flowering crop is done, you cut it down, you clean the room, you reset
[06:06.160 --> 06:10.480]  the room, and you drag a set of flowering plants right back in there and you never miss
[06:10.480 --> 06:11.480]  a beat.
[06:11.480 --> 06:15.040]  That room never gets a break so you're always on top of production, which means you always
[06:15.040 --> 06:17.080]  have to have a supply of clones.
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.360]  You'll have veg plants.
[06:18.360 --> 06:20.000]  You'll cut a few clones off of them.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.760]  You'll cut down your flowering plants.
[06:21.760 --> 06:25.280]  You'll clean up that room, drag those veg plants right into there, and then you'll start
[06:25.280 --> 06:27.480]  growing those little clones up into the next batch.
[06:27.480 --> 06:29.080]  They'll be your veg plants.
[06:29.080 --> 06:30.080]  You have to top them.
[06:30.080 --> 06:31.080]  You have to train them.
[06:31.080 --> 06:34.960]  You've got a full nine weeks to get them as big as you need them and get them prepared
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.240]  for the next run.
[06:36.240 --> 06:39.800]  So when that flowering crop gets done that you've got in the flowering room, you cut
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.340]  it down, clean it up, drag those veg plants right in there.
[06:43.340 --> 06:47.360]  But before you do that, you take a few clones so that you can keep the cycle going.
[06:47.360 --> 06:51.880]  The idea is to create a perpetual cycle for yourself so you're always self-sufficient.
[06:51.880 --> 06:54.440]  You never have to bring anything in from outside.
[06:54.440 --> 06:56.120]  That way you can keep the grow clean.
[06:56.120 --> 06:58.720]  That way you know if you get any bugs or any pests, it's your fault.
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.560]  You can't blame anybody else.
[07:00.560 --> 07:03.520]  But it really limits the opportunities to bring in problems.
[07:03.520 --> 07:06.800]  And it also helps you develop a relationship with one strain.
[07:06.800 --> 07:11.000]  If you run a perpetual grow with just one, maybe two strains max, you can really dial
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  those strains in.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.240]  You can build a relationship with them, and then you can get them to reach their full
[07:15.240 --> 07:16.240]  potential.
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.080]  There are several ways to do perpetual grows.
[07:19.080 --> 07:21.120]  You can do it by swapping the whole room.
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.160]  You can do it by having part of the room harvest every couple of weeks.
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.240]  I've done a full episode on that.
[07:26.240 --> 07:30.840]  But I do plan to redo it in the future for a six plant count because Colorado is now
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.520]  limited to six plants for recreational or medical patients.
[07:34.520 --> 07:40.000]  So I will do a revised perpetual grow episode based on a six plant count.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.920]  If you're interested in listening to the current or maybe the old scheduling a perpetual grow
[07:44.920 --> 07:47.280]  episode, that is episode number 73.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.520]  I think it is a great episode.
[07:48.520 --> 07:52.420]  I put a lot of time and effort into creating that episode.
[07:52.420 --> 07:55.780]  So episode 73, all about creating a perpetual grow.
[07:55.780 --> 07:57.940]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  My point is to make sure you have got either a source for clones or clones for your next
[08:02.460 --> 08:03.460]  run.
[08:03.460 --> 08:07.460]  And also, it is always a good idea to think about becoming more self-sufficient, and you
[08:07.460 --> 08:11.420]  can do so by creating a perpetual grow.
[08:11.420 --> 08:15.460]  Now the next thing on my checklist that I would think about in this brand new grow room
[08:15.460 --> 08:19.600]  that we just recently built is, do we have any light leaks?
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.700]  Do we have grow lights leaking out into the outside?
[08:22.700 --> 08:25.780]  And do we have outside lights leaking into the inside?
[08:25.780 --> 08:29.960]  This is very important to find out before we go into the flower phase.
[08:29.960 --> 08:35.240]  We need to go in that grow room and turn off the grow lights and sit in there for 15 or
[08:35.240 --> 08:41.200]  20 minutes and let your eyes adjust to the total darkness and see if you see any light
[08:41.200 --> 08:43.880]  at all in your flowering room.
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.600]  If you can see any light, that is too much.
[08:46.600 --> 08:49.680]  You should not be able to see your hand in front of your own face.
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.400]  It needs to be completely dark.
[08:51.400 --> 08:53.600]  I've done an episode called Total Darkness.
[08:53.600 --> 08:55.320]  Check that one out also.
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.960]  Any light leaks in the flowering phase are going to cause your plants problems.
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.400]  You're either going to get no flowering at all, you're going to get slow flowering, or
[09:03.400 --> 09:04.840]  you're going to get hermaphrodites.
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.160]  You'll get plants that'll start to flower and they'll never finish, or you just may
[09:08.160 --> 09:12.120]  get crazy weird mutated plants because of an odd light leak.
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.360]  So go in the grow room, turn off all the grow lights, and just sit there for a few minutes.
[09:16.400 --> 09:17.400]  Put your phone away.
[09:17.400 --> 09:20.040]  Don't have any light making your eyes do weird things.
[09:20.040 --> 09:21.600]  Just let there be total darkness.
[09:21.600 --> 09:22.600]  Let your eyes adjust.
[09:22.600 --> 09:25.200]  And if you see any light, you need to correct it.
[09:25.200 --> 09:28.600]  You need some of that silver foil tape, or maybe you need to fill the gaps with some
[09:28.600 --> 09:30.880]  caulk and cover it up with some duct tape.
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.240]  Just seal up all of those light leaks.
[09:33.240 --> 09:39.600]  Now if your grow room is on an exterior wall, meaning that wall is next to the outside,
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.640]  or if there is a lot of activity on the opposite side of the wall of which you are growing,
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.200]  I suggest you go in your grow room and turn off the grow lights during either the sunshine
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.480]  hours or the busy hours of that room, and see if any of the light from either the sun
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.380]  or that adjacent room are leaking into your grow room during their busy hours.
[10:00.380 --> 10:04.000]  If your grow room has a window and the sun is shining on that window and the curtains
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.720]  aren't thick enough to block out that sun, or whatever you've put over that window is
[10:07.720 --> 10:11.920]  not thick enough to block out that sunlight, we need to know that before we go into the
[10:11.920 --> 10:13.840]  flowering phase.
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.320]  The sun may come up an hour before your grow lights come on.
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.040]  They may start getting a full hour of sunlight coming through that window that you're unaware
[10:22.040 --> 10:25.240]  of and that's going to disrupt their flowering cycle.
[10:25.240 --> 10:30.160]  So go in there and check at all hours and see if you are getting total darkness, especially
[10:30.160 --> 10:33.860]  the hours you plan on putting your plants in their night cycle.
[10:33.860 --> 10:38.360]  Make sure that room is actually dark, and if it's not, correct it.
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.780]  Now the next thing we need to do is the opposite.
[10:40.780 --> 10:44.820]  We need to go outside and make sure that none of our grow room lights are leaking to
[10:44.820 --> 10:49.580]  the outside, especially if you're running your grow lights during the outside night
[10:49.580 --> 10:50.580]  cycle.
[10:50.580 --> 10:53.300]  You are lighting up the outside neighborhood with your grow lights.
[10:53.300 --> 10:55.500]  Those grow lights are going to bring unwanted attention.
[10:55.500 --> 10:57.740]  You will bring thieves and law enforcement.
[10:57.740 --> 11:01.840]  So make sure you're not leaking any light out of your grow room.
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.860]  Now is also a good time to start thinking about, when am I going to run my flowering
[11:05.860 --> 11:06.860]  cycle?
[11:06.860 --> 11:09.540]  Do you want the lights on when it's dark outside?
[11:09.900 --> 11:13.180]  Do you want the lights on when it's light outside?
[11:13.180 --> 11:17.300]  Electricity is cheaper during off-peak hours, which means when all the business is closed
[11:17.300 --> 11:20.380]  and everybody goes home, electricity gets cheaper.
[11:20.380 --> 11:25.140]  You can look on your bill and find out when peak and off-peak hours are.
[11:25.140 --> 11:29.820]  Since electricity is more affordable at off-peak hours, many growers will choose to run their
[11:29.820 --> 11:31.820]  lights during those hours.
[11:31.820 --> 11:36.700]  Also, when the sun is not up, we don't have to try to keep the room cool with the grow
[11:36.700 --> 11:39.460]  lights and the sun competing against us.
[11:39.500 --> 11:43.140]  When the sun goes down, it automatically gets a little bit cooler outside.
[11:43.140 --> 11:47.180]  You can fire up your grow lights and you don't have as much heat to deal with.
[11:47.180 --> 11:50.740]  If you're in a place that gets really cold, you can run those grow lights at night and
[11:50.740 --> 11:54.620]  it will really help keep your house warm if you've got a small house and you run the ducting
[11:54.620 --> 11:56.740]  right and you plan properly.
[11:56.740 --> 12:00.580]  I know several East Coast growers that used to keep their apartments warm by setting up
[12:00.580 --> 12:03.340]  a four or 600 watt light in the winter.
[12:03.340 --> 12:07.540]  They would kick out a small winter crop of super potent cannabis out of their very small
[12:07.540 --> 12:11.300]  apartment and they would also use that same light to keep themselves warm.
[12:11.300 --> 12:14.580]  So it was a very efficient way to do things back in the day.
[12:14.580 --> 12:18.140]  So now is a good time to start thinking about when you're going to run your lights in your
[12:18.140 --> 12:19.320]  flowering room.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.380]  You probably have to go to work part of the day.
[12:21.380 --> 12:24.700]  Do you want those lights to come on right when you get home from work?
[12:24.700 --> 12:28.420]  Do you want those lights to come on so you can work on the plants before you go to work?
[12:28.420 --> 12:30.820]  You've got a lot of things to plan and think about now.
[12:30.820 --> 12:34.700]  I suggest you work on the plants after work because you don't want to go to work smelling
[12:34.700 --> 12:36.060]  like dank.
[12:36.060 --> 12:40.420]  Most people work a day job nowadays, so you're going to go to work and then you'll get off
[12:40.420 --> 12:43.260]  hopefully in the evening, come home, work on the plants.
[12:43.260 --> 12:47.260]  That works out really well because you are now on off peak electricity hours and it is
[12:47.260 --> 12:49.340]  nighttime so you're not fighting that heat.
[12:49.340 --> 12:51.300]  You don't have to run as much electricity.
[12:51.300 --> 12:55.300]  So you get off work, come home, work on the plants, then you can take a nice shower.
[12:55.300 --> 12:58.560]  Then you don't stink for work next day and nobody knows that you're growing cannabis.
[12:58.560 --> 13:00.980]  If you were in a place, you need to keep it on the down low.
[13:00.980 --> 13:01.980]  All right.
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.580]  So now that I'm talking about being careful and keeping it on the down low, do you have
[13:05.580 --> 13:07.220]  a carbon filter set up?
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.760]  Is your filtration in place?
[13:08.760 --> 13:11.940]  Are you ready for a stinky crop of flowers?
[13:11.940 --> 13:16.040]  In just a few weeks, these plants are going to start stinking very heavily.
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.860]  You may get a nice aroma around 20 days in, depending on your genetics and what you're
[13:20.860 --> 13:23.980]  using for nutrients and the airflow in your room.
[13:23.980 --> 13:27.280]  Now is the time to order a carbon filter if you haven't already.
[13:27.280 --> 13:28.420]  You need to get that set up.
[13:28.420 --> 13:32.180]  You need to get it in place and you need to start controlling the aroma leaving your
[13:32.180 --> 13:33.860]  grow space.
[13:33.860 --> 13:37.380]  Now I need to back up and cover one thing that I overlooked when I was talking about
[13:37.380 --> 13:38.860]  light leaks.
[13:38.860 --> 13:44.460]  When you are using vented lights, which means you have got a light with glass between the
[13:44.460 --> 13:49.280]  bulb and the plant canopy and that's all sealed up in there and it's got a duct coming off
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.140]  of one end and off of the other and you're blowing a blower over it to get that heat
[13:53.140 --> 13:55.500]  from the light out of the grow space.
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.020]  A lot of people will run that ducting to the outside of the house.
[13:59.020 --> 14:03.300]  They'll run it out of a window just to make it go outside of the house somehow.
[14:03.300 --> 14:08.740]  A lot of times, the sunshine will reflect right down that ducting and come into your
[14:08.740 --> 14:11.980]  light reflector and work just like a light.
[14:11.980 --> 14:16.180]  You are channeling that light down that ducting right into your grow space.
[14:16.180 --> 14:20.720]  If you are not doing that while the lights are on, you are lighting up the plants and
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.860]  disrupting your night cycle.
[14:22.860 --> 14:28.300]  If you were using ducted hoods and you were running that to the outside of the house,
[14:28.300 --> 14:34.620]  you may need to adjust the duct to where the light does not make it into your grow room.
[14:34.620 --> 14:39.940]  Unfortunately, the inside of that ducting is quite often made with a very reflective
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.140]  material.
[14:41.140 --> 14:46.100]  You're probably going to have to give it a lot of bends or you'll have to create a baffle
[14:46.100 --> 14:51.340]  at the end of it to where the light is not allowed to even enter down that ducting.
[14:51.340 --> 14:58.260]  Another option is to get a can of flat black spray paint and spray paint the inside as
[14:58.260 --> 15:00.460]  far as you can make that spray paint go.
[15:00.460 --> 15:04.340]  Just put a nice little black layer in there and take that reflective layer off and that
[15:04.340 --> 15:07.460]  will prevent the light from getting in there as much.
[15:07.460 --> 15:09.240]  You still may need to make a bend.
[15:09.240 --> 15:15.140]  You may need to put some sort of light baffle over it, but please check and see if the light
[15:15.140 --> 15:19.580]  is coming through your ducted hoods and disrupting your night cycle.
[15:19.580 --> 15:25.460]  The sunshine will make it so far down that ducting, you will be amazed.
[15:25.460 --> 15:30.440]  Just one little speckle of sunlight will completely disrupt your flowering cycle.
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.060]  If you think the plants are in the dark and they're getting that one little pinprick of
[15:34.060 --> 15:36.100]  sunlight, they're not in the dark.
[15:36.100 --> 15:39.300]  Also, take a quick look at all of the equipment in your grow room.
[15:39.300 --> 15:41.980]  Does your air conditioner have blue and red lights on it?
[15:41.980 --> 15:45.260]  Is there something in the grow room that's illuminating a blue display?
[15:45.260 --> 15:49.080]  If you have any lights in there, you need to put some tape or some sort of a flap over
[15:49.080 --> 15:52.600]  it so that light does not disrupt your flowering cycle.
[15:52.600 --> 15:57.900]  The only color of light that is acceptable during the night cycle is a green light.
[15:57.900 --> 16:02.520]  And there are still situations where I have seen those green lights cause problems with
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.360]  people's plants by running that green light too much during a dark cycle.
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.000]  I would prefer it be completely dark in your grow room.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  There's nobody in there.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.360]  The plants are sleeping.
[16:13.360 --> 16:14.960]  We don't want any light.
[16:14.960 --> 16:16.640]  Make it as dark as you can get it.
[16:16.640 --> 16:19.960]  You want it scary dark and then a little bit darker.
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.180]  You don't want to be able to see your hand in front of your face when you're touching
[16:23.180 --> 16:24.280]  your nose.
[16:24.280 --> 16:25.440]  That's how dark we need it.
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.960]  Again, I've done an episode called Total Darkness, so give that one a listen if you don't understand
[16:29.960 --> 16:33.560]  why total darkness is so important in our indoor grow environment.
[16:33.560 --> 16:40.560]  All right, the next thing on my pre-flower checklist is, can you correctly identify females,
[16:40.560 --> 16:43.000]  males, and hermaphrodites?
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.240]  If you are running from seed especially, you have got the option to run into females, males,
[16:49.240 --> 16:51.120]  or hermaphrodites.
[16:51.120 --> 16:54.760]  You need to be able to identify these very early.
[16:54.760 --> 17:00.000]  If you find a male in the garden, it needs to be cold immediately.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.120]  If you come across a hermaphroditic plant early in flower, you need to know what that
[17:04.120 --> 17:09.240]  looks like so you can get it out of the grow room before it causes you problems.
[17:09.240 --> 17:14.400]  Your plants are going to start showing sex somewhere around 10 days into flower.
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.940]  By day 12 or 14, it will be really obvious if you've got male or female plants.
[17:19.940 --> 17:26.040]  By day 12 or 14, your female plants will be able to receive pollen from the male plants.
[17:26.040 --> 17:31.760]  If you're not paying attention, sometimes by day 10 or 12, a male plant can open up
[17:31.760 --> 17:33.440]  and start dropping pollen.
[17:33.440 --> 17:35.480]  Now your whole crop is pollinated.
[17:35.480 --> 17:38.800]  Everything is going to have seeds in it and you didn't even know because you weren't paying
[17:38.800 --> 17:39.960]  attention.
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.800]  So before we get to this risky phase, open up some books, do some google searches, and
[17:45.800 --> 17:48.880]  learn to identify a female cannabis plant.
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.360]  Learn to confidently identify a male cannabis plant and learn how to identify a plant that
[17:54.360 --> 17:57.720]  shows both sexes in the same plant.
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.640]  In the next episode, I plan to talk about phenohunting and selecting a mother plant
[18:01.640 --> 18:03.080]  from that phenohunt.
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.460]  In that episode, I will also include a talk about sexing our cannabis plants.
[18:07.460 --> 18:10.620]  It is very important at this phase and this stage of the game.
[18:10.620 --> 18:14.980]  So we need to know how to confidently identify males and females.
[18:14.980 --> 18:20.580]  I will be able to provide you detailed descriptions, but I recommend you look online for pictures
[18:20.580 --> 18:23.300]  of males and females of cannabis plants.
[18:23.300 --> 18:25.020]  They are very easy to spot.
[18:25.020 --> 18:27.740]  Once you look a few times, it will become very obvious.
[18:27.740 --> 18:30.180]  You just need to develop the confidence.
[18:30.180 --> 18:34.720]  So I will include a talk about it on the next episode, but you will still need to go look
[18:34.720 --> 18:39.800]  in a book or look online and get a good visual understanding of what you are looking for
[18:39.800 --> 18:44.200]  so you can spot it right away if something should pop up in your garden.
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.040]  Now another thing you should think about before you put your plants into flower is, are they
[18:48.040 --> 18:49.040]  healthy?
[18:49.040 --> 18:50.600]  Have you burned them with nutrients?
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.080]  Are they nutrient deficient?
[18:52.080 --> 18:55.400]  We may want to get them a little healthier before you put them into flower.
[18:55.400 --> 18:59.080]  We want these plants as healthy as we can get them before they go into the flowering
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.160]  phase.
[19:00.160 --> 19:05.600]  Another important thing to think about is, do you have any pest infestations?
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.080]  We aren't able to spray the plants with as many products once we get bud set, so we want
[19:10.080 --> 19:16.160]  to eradicate any pest problems before we go into the flowering phase.
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.400]  If you do have a pest problem at this time, it is time to step up the frequency of the
[19:20.400 --> 19:25.800]  sprays and quite possibly increase the potency of your sprays if not start introducing new
[19:25.800 --> 19:27.280]  products.
[19:27.280 --> 19:30.760]  We do not want to enter the flowering phase with a known pest problem.
[19:30.760 --> 19:36.680]  It is much easier to combat a pest problem while in veg, so let's focus on getting rid
[19:36.680 --> 19:41.360]  of any problems now and then we can move to flower a week late if that's what we need
[19:41.360 --> 19:46.880]  to do or we can adjust our plans accordingly, but let's make sure to get rid of every bug
[19:46.880 --> 19:48.780]  before we move to flower.
[19:48.780 --> 19:51.880]  So at this point we should have some backup clones for the next run.
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.680]  We know that the room is dark, we know there are no light leaks, there's no light getting
[19:55.680 --> 19:57.260]  in, there's no light getting out.
[19:57.260 --> 20:01.620]  We've got our aroma control, there's no stinky air getting out of the grow room.
[20:01.620 --> 20:05.780]  You guys, the number one way people get in trouble is by having stinky air coming out
[20:05.780 --> 20:06.780]  of the house.
[20:06.780 --> 20:08.260]  Control that aroma.
[20:08.260 --> 20:09.380]  Make sure you take care of that.
[20:09.380 --> 20:11.860]  We're allowed to grow cannabis in Colorado.
[20:11.860 --> 20:16.200]  You were just fine until somebody complains and says they can smell your garden.
[20:16.200 --> 20:20.140]  At that point, they send out an investigator and they come knock on your door and ask to
[20:20.140 --> 20:22.500]  look and see how many plants you've got.
[20:22.500 --> 20:25.140]  If you've got too many plants, you do get in trouble.
[20:25.140 --> 20:29.900]  So no matter how many plants you've got, I recommend you've got some sort of odor control
[20:29.900 --> 20:33.700]  so none of your neighbors get mad, nobody snitches on you, nobody comes knocking on
[20:33.700 --> 20:34.700]  your door.
[20:34.700 --> 20:38.840]  Even if you are within your legal amount of plants, it is still nerve wracking and stressful
[20:38.840 --> 20:42.000]  to have to deal with law enforcement because of your cannabis.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.700]  So simply control the odor.
[20:44.700 --> 20:46.860]  So again, we've got clones for the next round.
[20:46.860 --> 20:48.220]  We've got a nice dark room.
[20:48.220 --> 20:51.140]  We're controlling the odor that is leaving our room.
[20:51.140 --> 20:54.480]  We know how to identify males, females, and hermaphrodites.
[20:54.480 --> 20:57.680]  We know what to cull so that we don't cause any problems in the grow so that we don't
[20:57.680 --> 20:59.600]  seed up our whole grow.
[20:59.600 --> 21:00.960]  We know there are no pests.
[21:00.960 --> 21:03.000]  We know we haven't overfed the plants.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.280]  We are almost ready to flower.
[21:05.280 --> 21:07.940]  Now how do we know when to flower these plants?
[21:07.940 --> 21:11.960]  There are a couple of things that will help us determine when to initiate the flowering
[21:11.960 --> 21:14.160]  phase for our plants.
[21:14.160 --> 21:16.760]  One of the main factors will be the height.
[21:16.760 --> 21:19.920]  How much ceiling space do you have in your grow?
[21:19.920 --> 21:22.120]  Most of us are in a residential area.
[21:22.120 --> 21:26.080]  A lot of us are going to be modifying a bedroom or something similar.
[21:26.080 --> 21:28.840]  A lot of us may be using grow tents.
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.160]  You're going to have to flower your plants at a height to where they have plenty of room
[21:32.160 --> 21:36.980]  to grow to where they don't work themselves into the lights and you run out of space.
[21:36.980 --> 21:41.040]  You need to plan to leave, depending on what type of light you're using, you need to plan
[21:41.040 --> 21:45.660]  to leave an appropriate gap between the top of your plants and your light source.
[21:45.660 --> 21:48.580]  If you're using LEDs, you can get much closer.
[21:48.580 --> 21:51.800]  If you're using the ceramic metal halides, you can get kind of close.
[21:51.800 --> 21:55.900]  If you're using a high pressure sodium light, you need to stay kind of a distance away.
[21:55.900 --> 21:59.600]  If you're using a double ended Govita, you need to stay even further away.
[21:59.600 --> 22:03.720]  So plan for that when you're planning your flowering time.
[22:03.720 --> 22:07.120]  Now a good thing to think of when you were new at growing and you haven't grown a lot
[22:07.120 --> 22:11.880]  of crops and you want to prepare for flowering time and have enough space is prepare for
[22:11.880 --> 22:14.660]  your plants to double in height.
[22:14.660 --> 22:19.760]  If you were growing a sativa strain or something, a sativa hybrid with a lot of sativa genetics
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.320]  in there, it could double in height throughout the flowering phase.
[22:24.320 --> 22:28.440]  So if you vege your plant and the plant is three feet tall, you initiate flower.
[22:28.440 --> 22:33.840]  By the time it is done, you can expect a six foot tall plant if you're not doing anything
[22:33.840 --> 22:36.380]  to control that vertical growth.
[22:36.380 --> 22:39.260]  So in that case, I would plan to flower that plant.
[22:39.260 --> 22:42.800]  If you have got, if your light is six feet tall, we're going to say if your light is
[22:42.800 --> 22:45.720]  seven feet tall because we need some space.
[22:45.720 --> 22:49.600]  If your light is seven feet off the ground, I would veg those plants the first time I
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.600]  grow them.
[22:50.600 --> 22:53.200]  I would veg them until they are three feet tall.
[22:53.200 --> 22:56.120]  Once they are three feet tall, initiate the flower phase.
[22:56.120 --> 22:57.280]  They're going to double in height.
[22:57.280 --> 22:58.840]  They'll end about six feet tall.
[22:58.840 --> 23:02.600]  You'll still have that one foot of space between the light and the canopy.
[23:02.600 --> 23:04.120]  Now this is not a rule.
[23:04.120 --> 23:05.760]  This is just a guide.
[23:05.760 --> 23:09.000]  If you have not grown your strain before, if you don't know what these genetics are
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.080]  going to do, allow yourself room for these plants to double.
[23:13.080 --> 23:17.160]  Of course, if you've got plants with big, obvious fat white indica leaves, you may not
[23:17.160 --> 23:18.760]  get that doubled growth.
[23:18.760 --> 23:20.520]  You may only get a little bit of growth.
[23:20.520 --> 23:24.520]  You're going to get stretch for about three weeks and then they'll slow down on the stretching
[23:24.520 --> 23:27.040]  and the bud sets will really set in.
[23:27.040 --> 23:31.040]  But try to plan ahead for too much headspace.
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.320]  There's nothing worse than having a big, giant, beautiful top cola that is just beefy and
[23:36.320 --> 23:41.400]  covered in trichomes and then it starts murdering itself by growing directly into your lights.
[23:41.400 --> 23:42.580]  It starts touching the light.
[23:42.580 --> 23:43.700]  It starts burning itself.
[23:43.700 --> 23:44.940]  It starts getting ugly colors.
[23:44.940 --> 23:47.300]  You have to think about, do I want to bend that bud over?
[23:47.300 --> 23:49.100]  Do I actually want to cut part of that off?
[23:49.100 --> 23:50.780]  What do I do at this point?
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.020]  That is really heartbreaking.
[23:52.020 --> 23:56.060]  So plan ahead and try to give yourself plenty of headspace.
[23:56.060 --> 23:57.860]  Also keep in mind spacing.
[23:57.860 --> 24:00.720]  You don't want the plants touching each other too much.
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.280]  Just think about if you and I and another couple of dudes were hanging out in a room,
[24:04.280 --> 24:07.740]  if we all just started spreading our arms around, just touching each other all weird,
[24:07.740 --> 24:08.740]  you're going to get kind of weirded out.
[24:08.740 --> 24:10.300]  You're like, bro, why are you touching me?
[24:10.300 --> 24:12.160]  And you're going to want your own space.
[24:12.160 --> 24:14.020]  The plants are very similar.
[24:14.020 --> 24:17.760]  When one plant feels another plant touch it, it indicates to itself, I probably shouldn't
[24:17.760 --> 24:20.560]  grow much further that way because I'm already touching a limit.
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.360]  And the other plant says the same thing.
[24:22.360 --> 24:25.280]  So now you've got two plants that have just stopped out branching and they're going to
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.600]  start growing up.
[24:26.600 --> 24:29.520]  So allow your plants plenty of space.
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.640]  Spread them out a little bit.
[24:30.640 --> 24:33.400]  Yes, we do want to maximize canopy space.
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.980]  We do want to maximize the space of our grow, but we don't want to crush them in so much
[24:37.980 --> 24:39.480]  we can't get airflow.
[24:39.480 --> 24:42.360]  We don't want to crush them in so much that they're uncomfortable.
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.160]  We need a little bit of airflow and we don't want leaves stacking on top of each other
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.440]  because that's where you start causing problems.
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.320]  So give them some space, space your plants out, give them some breathing room, give them
[24:52.320 --> 24:53.800]  some growing room.
[24:53.800 --> 24:57.840]  And keep in mind that when you put your plants into the flowering phase, they are only halfway
[24:57.840 --> 24:59.020]  through their life cycle.
[24:59.020 --> 25:00.760]  They still need to bush out a little bit.
[25:00.760 --> 25:02.040]  They're going to grow much taller.
[25:02.040 --> 25:03.740]  You're only halfway there.
[25:03.740 --> 25:07.000]  So allow that extra space for flowering.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.880]  Now if you're running a screen of green or a trellis system, I suggest you veg until
[25:10.880 --> 25:13.700]  you kind of fill out most of that screen system.
[25:13.700 --> 25:18.000]  The idea is to try to get one little branch coming through each of those squares in your
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  trellis system.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.400]  If you can maximize that, that's when you really start cranking out as much bud as you
[25:23.400 --> 25:25.560]  can produce in your space.
[25:25.560 --> 25:30.880]  So I suggest you fill that canopy up and fill that screen up before you flower because you're
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.240]  spreading it out nice and wide.
[25:32.240 --> 25:34.920]  It's not going straight up like the guys without the screen.
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.560]  If you're spreading it out, you've still got all that vertical growth left for you.
[25:38.560 --> 25:41.960]  So you can spread it out, then put it into flower and it's going to grow vertically for
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  you.
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.200]  So I recommend you use all of that screen space to the best of your ability.
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.200]  All right, I feel like that is a good explanation of when to flower the plants.
[25:50.200 --> 25:53.000]  You want to give yourself about double the space.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.400]  You want to allow some space between the lights and the plants.
[25:56.400 --> 25:59.880]  You also want to give the plants some space so they can breathe and so they can stretch
[25:59.880 --> 26:00.880]  out.
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.120]  Now, if you've done any topping, I would definitely recommend 10 to 14 days of recovery time before
[26:06.120 --> 26:07.880]  you move the plants into flower.
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.840]  So plan ahead, do all of your topping plenty of time in advance so the plants can heal,
[26:12.840 --> 26:14.840]  so they can redistribute the hormones.
[26:14.840 --> 26:17.920]  That way the plant can produce big fat, chunky top buds.
[26:17.920 --> 26:21.960]  If you top a plant and move it into flower too soon, you'll notice those top buds don't
[26:21.960 --> 26:24.560]  really produce the colas that we're expecting.
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.360]  So give your plant time to recover from topping, let those hormones move around and it will
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.760]  make a huge difference in the productivity of your plant.
[26:31.760 --> 26:35.380]  So I feel like that is a pretty good before flower checklist.
[26:35.380 --> 26:36.840]  Make sure the plants are healthy.
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.400]  Make sure you understand how to find males, females, and hermaphrodites.
[26:40.400 --> 26:45.180]  Make sure you're pest free and make sure you've got a good idea of when to flower those plants.
[26:45.180 --> 26:49.840]  Try to set a schedule, try to stick to it as long as you are pest free.
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.680]  I would suggest that you keep twisting and popping the stems, making those stalks nice
[26:53.680 --> 26:56.120]  and robust until it's time to flower.
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.500]  Keep pulling off any yellow or funky leaves.
[26:58.500 --> 27:00.280]  Keep the plants looking nice and healthy.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.280]  Keep them thriving.
[27:01.280 --> 27:06.320]  And when it's time to flower, flip that timer to 12-12, make a note of what day you did
[27:06.320 --> 27:09.520]  it, and now you are in the flowering phase.
[27:09.520 --> 27:12.400]  Several people have asked me when flowering starts.
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.640]  Does flowering start the day you change the timer to 12-12 or does flowering start the
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.640]  day you start seeing buds set?
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.120]  If you are looking at a package of seeds and it says these seeds will take 8-10 weeks to
[27:23.120 --> 27:29.520]  flower, that 8-10 weeks starts the day you change your timer to 12-12.
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.120]  The day you do the flip is the beginning of your flowering phase.
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.760]  That's when that new schedule, that new calendar, the new countdown, that is when that begins.
[27:38.760 --> 27:44.800]  So if you were running 24 hours or 20 on and 4 off or 18 and 6 in veg, you just go in and
[27:44.800 --> 27:50.320]  you change that timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off, and that is day one of your flowering
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.320]  phase.
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.840]  In about 10-12 days, you'll start seeing pre-flower, the plants will start showing you sex, you
[27:55.840 --> 27:59.360]  need to go through and start pulling out all of the boys by this point.
[27:59.360 --> 28:04.500]  By day 14, the boys will be very obvious, they will be getting ready to pollinate if
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.860]  they have not already dropped pollen.
[28:06.860 --> 28:10.040]  Pay close attention to the boys and get them out of there.
[28:10.040 --> 28:14.720]  For the first 2 or 3 weeks of flowering, you're going to focus heavily on looking for male
[28:14.720 --> 28:20.440]  plants and plants with hermaphrodite traits and removing them from the garden safely.
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.920]  So again, I suggest that you start now doing some research on understanding what a male
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.520]  and a female and a hermaphrodite cannabis plant look like so that when you are 8, 10,
[28:29.520 --> 28:34.360]  12 or 14 days into flower, you are certain what you see and you are confident so that
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.960]  you can make the correct decision to keep your garden in top shape.
[28:37.960 --> 28:41.800]  All right, I feel like that is a great place to stop because my next lesson is going to
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.520]  be about phenohunting and sexing the plants and selecting a mother plant from that phenohunt
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.720]  process.
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.100]  Then we're going to work our way into the flowering stage of the grow lesson.
[28:52.100 --> 28:56.200]  That's right, it is almost time to flower the hypothetical plants in the grow lesson,
[28:56.200 --> 28:58.600]  so that is coming up very soon.
[28:58.600 --> 29:03.720]  I will talk in depth about probably 3 week chunks of the flowering phase.
[29:03.720 --> 29:09.000]  We'll probably do week 1 through 3 and then we'll do 4 through 6 and then we'll do 7 through
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  9.
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.680]  That was hard for my brain to process that quickly.
[29:11.680 --> 29:13.880]  But that is my idea for the flowering phase.
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.660]  I'm going to break it down into 3, 3 week chunks and then we'll talk about finishing
[29:17.800 --> 29:18.800]  the plants up.
[29:18.800 --> 29:20.060]  So that is coming up very soon.
[29:20.060 --> 29:22.900]  So I feel like this is a great place to wrap up this episode.
[29:22.900 --> 29:24.580]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
