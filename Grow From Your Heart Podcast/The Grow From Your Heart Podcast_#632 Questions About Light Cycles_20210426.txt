[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Yeah, here we go, Podcast World.
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.940]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 632 of the Grow From Your
[00:12.940 --> 00:13.940]  Heart Podcast.
[00:13.940 --> 00:17.560]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on Patreon questions.
[00:17.560 --> 00:21.920]  Before we get there, let's do a few shoutouts to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:21.920 --> 00:27.400]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.400]  level or higher.
[00:28.800 --> 00:32.260]  With no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank
[00:32.260 --> 00:35.320]  you shoutout to my friend Richo Relaxo.
[00:35.320 --> 00:39.200]  Let's send a thank you shoutout to DTom420 and Sticky Randy.
[00:39.200 --> 00:41.600]  Let's send a big thank you shoutout to a new supporter.
[00:41.600 --> 00:44.080]  Let's send some love to our new friend Zee-suffer.
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.760]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout to our friend No Till Luminati.
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.080]  Let's send some love to 716 Grows and G7.
[00:52.080 --> 00:55.240]  Let's send a big fist bump to Brett E. and Godfather Kush.
[00:55.240 --> 00:58.680]  Let's send a big high five and a shoutout to Noah N and GrampsMemo.
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.480]  And then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.760]  to my friend Coach Steve.
[01:04.760 --> 01:09.200]  Big thanks and big shoutout to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:09.200 --> 01:12.800]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:19.240 --> 01:21.640]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:21.640 --> 01:25.440]  And of course, I did add a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:25.440 --> 01:27.740]  it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:27.740 --> 01:30.920]  Maybe you're working, maybe you're driving, maybe you're like Mike, maybe you've got the
[01:30.920 --> 01:33.000]  kids, maybe you're just busy.

[01:42.200 --> 01:44.280]  from your heart.
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.880]  I want to start the show off by saying thank you to everybody who watched the 420 show
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.600]  and sent me feedback and comments and corrections and concerns and all of the above.
[01:53.600 --> 01:54.600]  Thank you.
[01:54.600 --> 01:56.640]  I got a lot of response to the 420 show.
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.520]  In my mind, I call it a beautiful train wreck.
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.680]  When you get that many people on screen, you never know what's going to happen.
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.200]  I think it went pretty well.
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.240]  There were a couple of train wreck moments, but I expected all of them and we recovered
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.880]  very well from all of them.
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.240]  So big shout out and big thanks to everybody who watched the 420 show.
[02:14.240 --> 02:17.960]  Extra shout out to everybody who participated in that madness.
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.320]  I also want to send some love to everybody who watched and commented on the 420 episode.
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.560]  I'm sure you saw the episode live from Jamaica with our Rasta friends who taught us quite
[02:27.560 --> 02:30.160]  a bit about Rastafari and 420.
[02:30.160 --> 02:31.480]  Big shout out to our teachers.
[02:31.480 --> 02:35.320]  Also big shout out to everybody who watched and listened to that episode.
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.200]  Thanks for all the comments, the feedback, the questions, corrections, comments, and
[02:39.200 --> 02:40.200]  concerns.
[02:40.200 --> 02:41.480]  They were all appreciated.
[02:41.480 --> 02:43.720]  That episode is still new at the time of this recording.
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.400]  So a lot of people are still commenting and watching.
[02:46.400 --> 02:47.400]  Thank you.
[02:47.400 --> 02:48.400]  I appreciate a lot of feedback.
[02:48.400 --> 02:51.160]  And if you haven't watched those two episodes, please do watch.
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.920]  I think those are two of the more fun episodes I've put out in quite some time.
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.760]  Also you can look forward to more shows with guests because hosting a show with 20 people,
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.400]  if I can do that, there's definitely no problem hosting a show, trying to have a conversation
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.980]  one-on-one with another fellow grower, fellow breeder, maybe a light manufacturer.
[03:11.980 --> 03:12.980]  You know who you are.
[03:12.980 --> 03:13.980]  We're going to get you on the show, brother.
[03:13.980 --> 03:15.040]  Look forward to that coming up real soon.
[03:15.680 --> 03:17.280]  I'm going to do shows with more people.
[03:17.280 --> 03:19.440]  I'm going to push the mic away from my face and clear my throat.
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.480]  Excuse me for one moment while the music plays.
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.000]  You deserve better than that from me.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.080]  I'm going to blame the raspy throat on a product here from Green Dot Labs called the Rapture.
[03:31.080 --> 03:33.480]  This is a live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[03:33.480 --> 03:35.560]  I'm going to show it to the camera here.
[03:35.560 --> 03:38.120]  It may not focus real well because the camera is far away.
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.320]  It is a beautiful golden batter.
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.040]  Anyway, my throat sounds raspy because I took a big fat dab of Rapture live batter from
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.320]  Green Dot Labs.
[03:46.320 --> 03:49.160]  This is a blend of Headbanger and Han Solo Burger.
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.800]  On the package, it is described as, the flavor is described as sour diesel and complex grapes.
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.800]  On the potency label, it says 73.08% THC, non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.520]  The reason I'm talking about it is because it got me lit and my voice is all funky from
[04:05.520 --> 04:08.600]  it, but this concentrate is delicious.
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.000]  It tastes like grape, bubblegum, and gas.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.880]  Then it's got after notes of real floral flowers and that complex grape thing is a
[04:17.880 --> 04:18.880]  good description.
[04:18.880 --> 04:20.680]  It's got that grape bubblegum.
[04:20.680 --> 04:23.960]  You know when you put grape gum in your mouth, it's like, oh, that's definitely grape gum,
[04:23.960 --> 04:27.960]  but then if you gave it a couple of chews, it would turn into fuel and then berries and
[04:27.960 --> 04:31.520]  some sort of wildflowers or something.
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.280]  A little bit of lilacs, but I'm not a fan of lilacs, but I like this flavor.
[04:35.280 --> 04:37.560]  It reminds me of the good part of lilacs.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.640]  Let me get off on a ramble here.
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.480]  The reason I don't like lilacs and lavender as well, when I smell it, I can feel it in
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.480]  my nose.
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.760]  Maybe that's another one of those synesthesia kind of things I've got going on.
[04:47.760 --> 04:52.520]  Maybe it's just straight up crazy, but anyway, when I smell lilacs and lavender, I feel it
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.520]  in my nose.
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.120]  This has that aroma, the wildflowers, lilacs, lavenders, honeysuckles, but it doesn't bother
[04:58.120 --> 04:59.120]  my nose.
[04:59.120 --> 05:00.120]  I find it to be pleasant.
[05:00.120 --> 05:03.620]  Obviously, got me high as giraffe pussy, nice and rambly.
[05:03.620 --> 05:05.340]  Great product from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[05:05.340 --> 05:06.340]  They do not sponsor me.
[05:06.340 --> 05:07.340]  They do not pay me.
[05:07.540 --> 05:11.580]  Shout out to our friends at Colorado Cannabis Exchange for taking good care of me.
[05:11.580 --> 05:12.580]  That's where I pick these up.
[05:12.580 --> 05:13.580]  I shouldn't have said that.
[05:13.580 --> 05:15.660]  You're all going to go there and buy it now, and they won't have it when I want it, but
[05:15.660 --> 05:16.660]  I love you.
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.060]  I love the store, and I love the Green Dot product.
[05:18.060 --> 05:20.740]  So, shout out to everybody for keeping me high.
[05:20.740 --> 05:23.500]  Once again, Colorado Cannabis Exchange hooks me up pretty well.
[05:23.500 --> 05:24.500]  They take good care of me.
[05:24.500 --> 05:28.120]  I get a friends and family sort of thing over there, but nobody really pays me to advertise
[05:28.120 --> 05:29.120]  this product.
[05:29.120 --> 05:30.460]  I thought it was fucking amazing.
[05:30.460 --> 05:33.220]  It tastes real good and got me lit, so I wanted to talk about it.
[05:33.220 --> 05:36.140]  Welcome to Rasta Jeff's world, a little bit of you behind the curtain.
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.780]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[05:37.780 --> 05:39.500]  I'm stoned and talking about random shit.
[05:39.500 --> 05:41.740]  Where was I going to go from there?
[05:41.740 --> 05:44.020]  It is a beautiful day today, you guys.
[05:44.020 --> 05:46.760]  Speaking of being out at the dispensary and getting products and driving around and checking
[05:46.760 --> 05:50.220]  out the sneaker shop and going to the grocery store, I did all those things, and it was
[05:50.220 --> 05:53.300]  a beautiful, beautiful day today.
[05:53.300 --> 05:58.860]  What that leads me to say is let's get prepared for the warmer growing season.
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.840]  Indoor grow season is about to change.
[06:00.840 --> 06:05.020]  A lot of people have to get different gear for the indoors as they do the outdoors.
[06:05.020 --> 06:09.780]  I'm in Colorado, so outdoors, it got negative 17 degrees here in the winter.
[06:09.780 --> 06:14.140]  In the summer, it's going to get 104, 106-ish degrees here.
[06:14.140 --> 06:15.540]  Not consistently, but it will hit that.
[06:15.540 --> 06:17.900]  I've got to be prepared for those days.
[06:17.900 --> 06:19.780]  I've got to adjust my grow.
[06:19.780 --> 06:21.060]  I turn blowers around.
[06:21.060 --> 06:24.740]  I uninstall and reinstall an air conditioner at certain times of the year.
[06:24.740 --> 06:25.740]  I use one blower.
[06:25.740 --> 06:27.740]  I use different gear at different times of the year.
[06:27.740 --> 06:31.980]  What I'm getting at is it's time for you, for us, for the community, for the ganja growers
[06:31.980 --> 06:37.140]  growing indoors to start getting our equipment in line because the time is coming soon.
[06:37.140 --> 06:40.300]  We're going to need an air conditioner in the grow space.
[06:40.300 --> 06:42.460]  We're going to need a dehumidifier possibly.
[06:42.460 --> 06:44.780]  We may need more fans.
[06:44.780 --> 06:49.820]  We're going to need something to battle that warm summer sun, especially here in Colorado.
[06:49.820 --> 06:51.600]  Maybe you're in Arizona.
[06:51.600 --> 06:54.500]  Maybe you're in some place you don't get a lot of drastic swings, but a lot of us are
[06:54.500 --> 06:56.740]  going to have to think about this right now.
[06:56.740 --> 06:57.740]  Pull out the air conditioner.
[06:57.740 --> 06:59.220]  Do you have a window unit?
[06:59.220 --> 07:02.780]  Just make sure you've got all the stuff to put that air conditioner in the window to
[07:02.780 --> 07:06.140]  fucking seal it, support it, get it in there safely and securely.
[07:06.140 --> 07:08.060]  Also, have you cleaned it?
[07:08.060 --> 07:09.060]  Let's clean that thing out.
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.060]  It may be moldy.
[07:10.060 --> 07:11.060]  It may be funky.
[07:11.060 --> 07:12.060]  Let's take it apart.
[07:12.060 --> 07:15.620]  If you know what you're doing, not everybody is reliable at pulling apart an air conditioner,
[07:15.620 --> 07:19.060]  but you can clean the main part of it if you take off the back cover, front cover, clean
[07:19.060 --> 07:22.100]  that bad bitch up, get all the grime and gunk out of there.
[07:22.100 --> 07:24.820]  Then let's think about the dehumidifier.
[07:24.820 --> 07:26.420]  That thing gets dirty.
[07:26.420 --> 07:28.660]  If you lift up, I'm not sure what type of dehumidifier you've got.
[07:29.100 --> 07:32.620]  If you lift up the tank and underneath it, there's a little thing that it's probably
[07:32.620 --> 07:33.620]  really dirty.
[07:33.620 --> 07:39.140]  Somewhere in that dehumidifier or your humidifier, there is some nasty mold, funky, just disgusting
[07:39.140 --> 07:41.420]  this building up that you haven't discovered yet.
[07:41.420 --> 07:42.420]  Take it apart.
[07:42.420 --> 07:43.420]  Clean the shit out of it.
[07:43.420 --> 07:45.100]  Disinfect it and sanitize it.
[07:45.100 --> 07:49.100]  Let's set ourselves up for success for the upcoming growth season.
[07:49.100 --> 07:50.380]  Let's go in this winning.
[07:50.380 --> 07:51.980]  Let's have our armor tight.
[07:51.980 --> 07:53.400]  Let's have the car gassed up.
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.200]  Let's have the weapons loaded.
[07:55.200 --> 07:56.200]  Don't overload your weapons.
[07:56.200 --> 08:00.760]  It's all jammed, but let's get in there prepared and ready to go to battle for this growth
[08:00.760 --> 08:01.760]  season and let's win.
[08:01.760 --> 08:02.760]  That's how we win.
[08:02.760 --> 08:05.400]  We prepare now, set ourselves up for success.
[08:05.400 --> 08:06.920]  So we got the air conditioner cleaned up.
[08:06.920 --> 08:08.880]  We've got the dehumidifier cleaned up.
[08:08.880 --> 08:12.000]  Also, are you going to switch from HPS lights to LEDs?
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.760]  That may be something I do now.
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.360]  In the winter, I may rely on those HPS lights to keep my grow room safe.
[08:17.360 --> 08:20.800]  I fucked up and switched to LEDs in the winter.
[08:20.800 --> 08:21.800]  My girl was mad at me.
[08:21.800 --> 08:22.800]  I learned a lot.
[08:22.800 --> 08:23.800]  I learned a lot.
[08:23.800 --> 08:24.800]  I fucked up.
[08:24.800 --> 08:25.800]  I made a mistake.
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.400]  Now the plants look great.
[08:27.400 --> 08:30.520]  Now that it's not fucking ass cheeks cold outside, now that it's not negative 17 degrees
[08:30.520 --> 08:33.400]  and I can keep the room nice, the plants look really good.
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.680]  But it was a bad idea to put the LEDs in there in the winter.
[08:35.680 --> 08:39.640]  I should have kept the HPS lights up for the winter, put the LEDs in in the summer.
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.800]  That is my new routine.
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.080]  That's what I will do.
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.720]  So what are you going to have to switch?
[08:43.720 --> 08:44.720]  Get it prepared.
[08:44.720 --> 08:46.360]  I'm going to get back on track.
[08:46.360 --> 08:48.600]  Fans is where I was headed with this.
[08:48.600 --> 08:49.600]  Clean the fans.
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.960]  Are you going to have to hang up a bunch of fans?
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.520]  If you need to put up new fans, clean them.
[08:54.520 --> 08:57.640]  Take the little shroud thing off, the piece that makes sure your dreadlocks don't get
[08:57.640 --> 08:58.640]  caught in there.
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.800]  Take that off.
[08:59.800 --> 09:00.800]  Clean that.
[09:00.800 --> 09:02.460]  It's probably got a bunch of grime and dust on it.
[09:02.460 --> 09:03.460]  Clean the fan blade.
[09:03.460 --> 09:06.960]  Take the fan blades off and scrub it with the brush and clean both sides of it.
[09:06.960 --> 09:08.260]  Get it clean.
[09:08.260 --> 09:13.440]  Just a little bit of dust and debris stuck on that thing will really lessen the efficiency
[09:13.440 --> 09:14.440]  of that fan.
[09:14.440 --> 09:16.320]  You're still paying for the electricity.
[09:16.320 --> 09:17.680]  You are not getting the efficiency.
[09:17.680 --> 09:19.240]  You're wasting money right there.
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.120]  Your grams per watt, your grams per dollar are going down rapidly.
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.120]  So let's clean the fan.
[09:24.720 --> 09:25.840]  You've got the fan blades off.
[09:25.840 --> 09:29.800]  Clean that back shroud and then also take a rag or a paper towel and clean the rest
[09:29.800 --> 09:30.800]  of it.
[09:30.800 --> 09:32.340]  You can see where all the muck and the grime is.
[09:32.340 --> 09:33.400]  Don't be fucking lazy.
[09:33.400 --> 09:34.400]  Don't skip that stuff.
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.040]  A lot of people are going to skip that.
[09:36.040 --> 09:37.260]  You know who you are.
[09:37.260 --> 09:38.320]  What if I show up in the grill?
[09:38.320 --> 09:39.560]  What if I come to your town one day?
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.560]  What if I'm just cruising?
[09:40.560 --> 09:42.120]  I got some good green dot dabs.
[09:42.120 --> 09:45.960]  I got a rig with me and I just post on social media, who wants to take a dab?
[09:45.960 --> 09:49.600]  I'm in this town and you're like, holy shit, he's in our town and you invite me over and
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.480]  I take a dab and I'm like, so what kind of girl you got?
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.720]  You walk in there and there's like cobwebs hanging from your fan.
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.760]  Your air conditioner is blowing out mold and fucking stink smell.
[09:58.760 --> 10:02.600]  Act like I'm coming over or act like somebody that you don't want to see the funk is coming
[10:02.600 --> 10:03.600]  over.
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.600]  Clean it up.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.600]  Make it look good.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.600]  Polish that shit up.
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.600]  Set yourself up for success.
[10:07.600 --> 10:08.600]  All right.
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.280]  I've talked enough about the preparing our indoor season for the warm season.
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.440]  Get the gear ready.
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.380]  You don't want a hot day to happen and you have to go, I got to go to the air conditioner
[10:17.380 --> 10:20.400]  store and buy an air conditioner and then install it tomorrow.
[10:20.400 --> 10:22.520]  You're already two days behind schedule at that point.
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.600]  You should have that fucker installed, tested, ready to go on a timer.
[10:26.600 --> 10:28.000]  When it got too hot, it should have came on.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.680]  Not you going, oh, my plants look angry.
[10:29.680 --> 10:31.200]  I got to fix that.
[10:31.200 --> 10:32.200]  You're the farmer.
[10:32.200 --> 10:33.200]  You're the grower.
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.200]  You're in charge.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.200]  Be responsible.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.200]  Go get that shit.
[10:36.200 --> 10:37.640]  So go get your gear ahead of time.
[10:37.640 --> 10:38.640]  Learn how to use it.
[10:38.640 --> 10:39.640]  Test it.
[10:39.640 --> 10:40.640]  Make sure it works.
[10:40.640 --> 10:42.920]  We don't want to, you don't want to have a gun fight and have to drive to the gun store
[10:42.920 --> 10:43.920]  to get the gun.
[10:43.920 --> 10:46.280]  You want the gun on the table and the gun fight starts.
[10:46.280 --> 10:47.280]  So let's go get some guns.
[10:47.280 --> 10:48.280]  Get prepared.
[10:48.280 --> 10:49.840]  I don't know what's with all the gun references today.
[10:50.280 --> 10:51.280]  I apologize.
[10:51.280 --> 10:53.200]  Anyway, get your shit prepared.
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.840]  Now also, you know who else needs to get prepared is the outdoor growers.
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.520]  If you don't have some clones ready, some feminized seed sprouted or something prepared
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.120]  for outdoors, you are running out of time.
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.700]  Let's get that shit ready.
[11:06.700 --> 11:09.320]  We talk about being patient enough to put it outdoors.
[11:09.320 --> 11:12.160]  Now you're becoming almost too late to put it outdoors.
[11:12.160 --> 11:15.080]  There's a really fine line in here and out here in Colorado.
[11:15.080 --> 11:16.800]  So get your stuff prepared.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.800]  That is going to lead me into another really good rant.
[11:18.800 --> 11:31.080]  But I need a sip of this little magic juice before I keep going.
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.360]  That is the most delicious stuff on the planet.
[11:33.360 --> 11:35.880]  Sometimes, sometimes that's my favorite.
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.200]  That is a pineapple and coconut nectar into one juice.
[11:39.200 --> 11:41.040]  Shout out to my buddy, Cascadian Grown.
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.360]  It's on a live video one night and he reached over and grabbed a bottle and took a big old
[11:44.360 --> 11:45.360]  drink of it.
[11:45.360 --> 11:46.360]  And I was like, bro, that stuff is magic.
[11:46.360 --> 11:47.360]  And he just smiled.
[11:47.360 --> 11:48.800]  He's like, it's the best shit ever.
[11:48.800 --> 11:49.800]  It is tasty.
[11:49.800 --> 11:52.560]  I shouldn't have talked about that because now you're all going to go buy that at the
[11:52.560 --> 11:54.520]  store too and it won't be there when I want it.
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.040]  I went to the store today to get soil, you guys, and I had to buy some random off-brand
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.080]  soil because they didn't have anything familiar today at the grow store at two different locations.
[12:04.080 --> 12:06.720]  They did not have any brand that I've ever heard of.
[12:06.720 --> 12:08.280]  I bought some new shit.
[12:08.280 --> 12:09.280]  It's still in the car.
[12:09.280 --> 12:11.760]  Got to wait for the sun to go down and bring it in when the neighbors aren't looking.
[12:11.760 --> 12:12.920]  But you know how it goes.
[12:12.920 --> 12:16.040]  I'll tell you how it goes once I try it out and let you know what I think.
[12:16.040 --> 12:18.240]  But shit's unlimited supply.
[12:18.240 --> 12:19.240]  It's getting weird.
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.240]  Let me get back on track.
[12:20.240 --> 12:22.200]  I'm high as giraffe pussy and we're rambling.
[12:22.840 --> 12:25.080]  It's time to get prepared.
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.120]  I see on social media, I troll social media quite a bit.
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.120]  It's fun to do.
[12:29.120 --> 12:30.720]  I'm just hanging out or pooping or whatever.
[12:30.720 --> 12:33.280]  I'm scrolling on social media, seeing what's going on.
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.480]  And I see people looking for two and three packs of feminized seeds.
[12:39.480 --> 12:42.040]  They're asking me, what they're asking for is a variety pack.
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.160]  They're like, hey, I see that you sell a six pack of fem seeds, but what I would like is
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.400]  two of this strain, two of this strain and two of this strain.
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.760]  And I don't do that.
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.640]  It would be a very, it'd be a very novel and wise financial investment.
[12:55.640 --> 12:57.560]  But there's a couple of reasons why I don't do that.
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.480]  Let me explain the first one as a business person, as a seed seller, somebody who works
[13:02.480 --> 13:03.480]  with seed vendors.
[13:03.480 --> 13:04.480]  Let me tell you why.
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.120]  Honestly, if I sell you two seeds and one of them doesn't germinate, you've got a 50
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.760]  50 germination rate and I look like shit.
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.680]  That's a bad, that's just not setting myself up for success as a business person.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.960]  You may have a bad experience.
[13:16.960 --> 13:19.240]  I could have a bad reputation.
[13:19.240 --> 13:20.240]  That's just not a wise move.
[13:20.720 --> 13:23.640]  You need better numbers in the package to give better options.
[13:23.640 --> 13:25.200]  Some growers are just killing seeds out there.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.200]  They're new.
[13:26.200 --> 13:27.320]  They don't know what they're doing.
[13:27.320 --> 13:30.920]  So I don't want you to kill one or two seeds and only buy two and then you're shit out
[13:30.920 --> 13:34.240]  of luck and you blame me or I just, that doesn't sound wise.
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.920]  So then if you kill one, you got a 50 50 germination rate and I still look like an asshole.
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.600]  So now let me talk about the real reason for consumers and the consumer end, why I don't
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.400]  like to sell two of this and two of this and two of this.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.400]  Not all two seeds are going to be exactly the same.
[13:50.400 --> 13:56.280]  There's going to be variation and the variation will be minimal in a pack of Femini seeds,
[13:56.280 --> 13:59.060]  but it does exist and it's not deniable.
[13:59.060 --> 14:06.020]  So I recommend getting six of one strain and growing all six of them and finding the keeper
[14:06.020 --> 14:09.660]  that is the best for your garden.
[14:09.660 --> 14:13.560]  It's like if you only had, if there was only one girl in town to choose from, you're going
[14:13.560 --> 14:15.440]  to date her and have a family and be satisfied.
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.480]  But if there are six women in town, one of them may be the one that you really wanted
[14:20.480 --> 14:23.400]  to fall in love with and you wouldn't even have noticed the other one.
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.400]  If there's only one that may be a horrible analogy to put it that way.
[14:26.400 --> 14:27.400]  I know I went horrible.
[14:27.400 --> 14:29.600]  I'm going to try to accent that in the video too.
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.320]  But if you've got more to select from, you can find something that is better for you,
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.840]  for your grow environment, for your grow space, for your medical needs, for your recreational
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.980]  needs, maybe your financial needs, however you're doing it.
[14:41.980 --> 14:46.540]  If you've got more to search from of one kind, you may find something better.
[14:46.540 --> 14:52.860]  So it's cool that you want two of this, two of this, two of this, but grow six seeds of
[14:52.860 --> 14:55.620]  one kind, find the winner out of that.
[14:55.620 --> 14:59.540]  Then buy another six pack of something else and grow the six of those and find the winner
[14:59.540 --> 15:00.540]  out of that.
[15:00.540 --> 15:04.260]  Find a, get something with strawberry flavors and find the strawberry you're looking for.
[15:04.260 --> 15:08.720]  Then get one with orange flavors and find the orange you're looking for and just focus
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.840]  on one at a time would be as a professional grower.
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.560]  That's I don't think I've ever said that, but I'm a professional grower is a very experienced
[15:16.560 --> 15:17.560]  grower.
[15:17.560 --> 15:18.560]  That's what I would recommend.
[15:18.560 --> 15:20.520]  Find that one six pack, grow those.
[15:20.520 --> 15:21.760]  And I understand you want variety.
[15:21.760 --> 15:23.920]  You need to get it going, but don't be in such a rush.
[15:23.920 --> 15:25.680]  Take your time.
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.840]  Take your time and find that one keeper, find that beautiful fucking star out of the pack
[15:29.840 --> 15:30.840]  and then do it again.
[15:30.840 --> 15:32.600]  And that way you know what you're looking for.
[15:32.600 --> 15:36.240]  You know that because we're always as a seed breeder, as a somebody who likes to grow from
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.680]  seed, we're always thinking it's like a pack of baseball cards.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.640]  That pack of baseball cards have that Mickey Mantle in there.
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.160]  And you never know if you find that Mickey Mantle rookie card until you plan it, grow
[15:45.160 --> 15:46.240]  it, flower it out.
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.060]  So finish the six pack and start a new one.
[15:49.060 --> 15:51.760]  That's why I don't sell two of this, two of this, two of this.
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.520]  So get a six pack, maybe a five pack of reg seeds, maybe a 10 pack of reg seeds and actually
[15:56.520 --> 15:58.380]  do a Fino hunt.
[15:58.380 --> 16:00.040]  There will be variation.
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.680]  You get to do your selection and that way you can see the phenotypical variation and
[16:04.680 --> 16:06.680]  know what you're actually looking for.
[16:06.680 --> 16:07.960]  It makes it just, it's more fun.
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.280]  You get to dial it in.
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.440]  You get to have what you want.
[16:10.440 --> 16:13.440]  It's like, what if I just said, Hey, your dinner's coming and you're like, what do I
[16:13.440 --> 16:14.440]  get?
[16:14.440 --> 16:15.440]  And I don't know, whatever shows up.
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.320]  And what, or if I was like, Hey, you get to choose from Italian food, Mexican food, uh,
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.200]  Chinese food, Thai food, Indian food.
[16:21.200 --> 16:22.320]  You get to take a pick.
[16:22.320 --> 16:25.440]  You're going to be much happier with those kinds of options instead of just whatever
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.760]  Rasta Jeff sent you.
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.480]  Cause I'm fucking mostly vegan and a lot of people already are going, fuck, I don't want
[16:30.480 --> 16:31.480]  to eat his meal.
[16:31.480 --> 16:33.720]  So anyway, give yourself options.
[16:33.720 --> 16:35.440]  Where am I going from here?
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.200]  So, um, we shouldn't be running untested stuff outdoors.
[16:40.200 --> 16:45.120]  Anyway, people are buying feminized seeds so that they can put two of this outside,
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.880]  two of this outside and two of this outside and hopes for a successful harvest outdoors.
[16:49.880 --> 16:50.880]  That is cool.
[16:50.880 --> 16:51.880]  I like that.
[16:51.880 --> 16:52.880]  You're going to grow some weed outside.
[16:52.880 --> 16:58.080]  You're going to grow some fem seeds outdoors, but, um, you should audition these plants
[16:58.080 --> 17:03.400]  before you put them outdoors in big pots and hope for your summer crop on a big old plant
[17:03.560 --> 17:05.720]  when you don't even really know what you've got.
[17:05.720 --> 17:08.600]  You could have, maybe it's not the phenotype you want.
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.840]  If you're growing from regular seed, maybe it's a male.
[17:10.840 --> 17:14.760]  I've done a full episode about not sexing your plants before you put them outside and
[17:14.760 --> 17:19.240]  then growing a three foot tall or three foot wide, six foot tall male plant that you got
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.760]  to cut down as soon as you realize it's a boy.
[17:21.760 --> 17:25.040]  Hopefully you realize it's a boy before you pollinated everybody's crop within fucking
[17:25.040 --> 17:26.260]  five miles.
[17:26.260 --> 17:29.120]  So you shouldn't be running untested stuff outdoors.
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.440]  In my opinion, the stuff should be tested indoors, verified a female, verified for
[17:35.440 --> 17:41.120]  the traits you're looking for, verified it's not problematic, then run it outside.
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.280]  And if you insist on running a seed outdoors that has not been tested, tried, true and
[17:45.280 --> 17:51.080]  verified, run a feminized seed from a reputable and reliable breeder.
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.680]  I'm not trying to say just buy seeds from iRegenetics, but that's what I would recommend
[17:54.680 --> 17:55.800]  and prefer.
[17:55.800 --> 17:56.800]  That is my brand.
[17:56.800 --> 18:02.560]  Of course, I'm going to boost my brand, but get feminized seeds from a reliable breeder.
[18:02.560 --> 18:03.760]  There are a lot of places to do it.
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.840]  I recommend seedsherenow.com of course, but if you're going to grow outdoors, please use
[18:08.840 --> 18:09.840]  that fem seed.
[18:09.840 --> 18:14.440]  But I totally think you should be auditioning these plants before you put them outside.
[18:14.440 --> 18:16.320]  They should at least be sex tested.
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.360]  You should at least know you got a good phenotype before you even think about putting it outside.
[18:20.360 --> 18:23.000]  We're skipping the selection steps and I get it.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.720]  A lot of people want to throw something outside and make some weed, but not only are you potentially
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.000]  wasting potentially, there comes that weird version of that word again.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  If you listen to a lot of episodes, you've heard me say potentially.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.280]  I don't know where it came from.
[18:35.280 --> 18:37.000]  I know the word is potentially.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.240]  Anyway, you're not only potentially messing up your own garden by planting possibly males,
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.120]  but you can mess up all of the gardens for several miles around you.
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.360]  Downwind there could be another garden that pollen hits that travels over there to that
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.760]  guy's plants to my plants.
[18:52.760 --> 18:54.800]  My plants outside are now pollinated.
[18:54.800 --> 18:57.920]  What if a bird, the bees, you guys know about the birds and the bees landing on plants and
[18:57.920 --> 19:00.240]  pollinating right?
[19:00.240 --> 19:01.240]  Stop that shit.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.240]  Don't make that shit happen.
[19:02.240 --> 19:03.240]  Prevent that.
[19:03.240 --> 19:04.240]  So audition your plants before you put them outside.
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.360]  I did say I was going to focus on some Patreon questions.
[19:08.360 --> 19:10.680]  I did write some down here.
[19:10.680 --> 19:12.200]  Let's see which one I want to do first.
[19:12.200 --> 19:13.840]  All right, here we go.
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.480]  Let's move over to the Patreon portion of this podcast.
[19:17.480 --> 19:20.520]  This part of the show is brought to you by our friend Kurt Z.
[19:20.520 --> 19:22.280]  Big up to my buddy Kurt Z.
[19:22.280 --> 19:25.840]  Trying to give some sneaky Patreon shout outs in there so I can get more Patreon shout outs
[19:25.840 --> 19:26.840]  off the list.
[19:26.840 --> 19:32.600]  I do promise to shout out people who contribute $7 and 10 cents or more every month, but I
[19:32.600 --> 19:37.200]  can't do enough episodes to get all of the shout outs into that many episodes right now
[19:37.200 --> 19:39.800]  because I get so many shout outs and so many paid patrons.
[19:39.800 --> 19:41.700]  If you haven't heard your name, I apologize.
[19:41.700 --> 19:42.700]  It's coming up.
[19:42.700 --> 19:44.300]  I'm trying to do a lot of content.
[19:44.300 --> 19:47.900]  There may be extra episodes coming up just to get these shout outs that I promise you
[19:47.900 --> 19:49.740]  do try to be a man of my word.
[19:49.740 --> 19:51.420]  I try to answer all of your questions.
[19:51.420 --> 19:53.260]  Also, I'm high as giraffe pussy.
[19:53.260 --> 19:55.900]  Let's stay focused and answer these questions.
[19:55.900 --> 19:57.940]  Shout out to my buddy Kurt Z.
[19:57.940 --> 20:02.940]  This question came from Patreon and it comes from DZ from Detroit.
[20:02.940 --> 20:05.900]  And this question goes a lot like this.
[20:05.900 --> 20:11.920]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, I'm running 18 and six and my off hours are midnight to 6 a.m.
[20:11.920 --> 20:16.000]  So what he means is the lights are on, uh, 18 on and six hours off.
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  Uh, they are off from midnight to 6 a.m., which is reasonable.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.040]  Uh, that's most people sleep in hours.
[20:23.040 --> 20:24.520]  That makes a lot of sense.
[20:24.520 --> 20:25.980]  And now it says, I want to change it.
[20:25.980 --> 20:29.800]  So my off hours are now 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.
[20:29.800 --> 20:32.520]  So some people have changes in plans, changes in life.
[20:32.520 --> 20:35.000]  Now it's time to change the light schedule.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.520]  It says, how do I go about doing this?
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.120]  The plants are three to four inches tall.
[20:39.120 --> 20:42.720]  Can I just make the switch and everything be all right?
[20:42.720 --> 20:46.080]  Now since these plants are little tiny itty bitty baby plants and they're just in the
[20:46.080 --> 20:50.220]  vegetative stage, they're not in flower, uh, they're not root bound cause they're little.
[20:50.220 --> 20:51.600]  They're not stressed out cause they're little.
[20:51.600 --> 20:56.880]  I'm going to assume at this point I would say just go ahead and switch the lights.
[20:56.880 --> 20:59.200]  You're not going to harm these plants at this stage of their life.
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.800]  Uh, you're not going to cause them any problems at this stage.
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.080]  They're three to four inches tall.
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.200]  They're brand new.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.320]  Once they get older, you may want to be more gentle about this and flower.
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.400]  You would definitely do it differently.
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.800]  Um, let's talk about how I would do this in flower.
[21:12.800 --> 21:14.720]  I've done a full episode about this.
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.840]  Somebody asked a similar question, but let me just recap in flower.
[21:18.840 --> 21:23.160]  The plants need at least that 12 hour on an uninterrupted dark cycle.
[21:23.160 --> 21:28.720]  So if you choose to change the timer in flower, what you would have to do is unplug the timer,
[21:28.720 --> 21:31.520]  let the 12 hour night cycle run through.
[21:31.520 --> 21:35.240]  Then at the new time that you want those lights to come on, that's when you would plug it
[21:35.240 --> 21:36.240]  on.
[21:36.240 --> 21:38.240]  But after the full 12 hour went through.
[21:39.160 --> 21:41.680]  So then you'd have to wait like another, if you want it to come on six hours difference,
[21:41.680 --> 21:45.240]  you'd have to wait that next six hours or however many hours then just plug it on.
[21:45.240 --> 21:50.040]  But as long as you gave it the full 12 hour sleep, then go back on, you'd be okay, but
[21:50.040 --> 21:52.360]  make sure it gets 12 hours.
[21:52.360 --> 21:56.640]  Sometimes you got to go like 24 hours to get it back on cycle 36 hours until you catch
[21:56.640 --> 22:00.400]  the next time, which you want to actually start your new 1212.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.680]  But it's better to give it long extended dark than it is to interrupt the dark is what I'm
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.680]  trying to say.
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.040]  We don't like being uninterrupted in our sleep, but we're okay to take a nap, right?
[22:12.040 --> 22:15.880]  Sometimes you take too many dabs, maybe it's four 20 you dabbed all day trying to do some
[22:15.880 --> 22:18.040]  videos and you end up just sleeping on the couch.
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.080]  That's acceptable, but don't wake me up.
[22:20.080 --> 22:22.560]  I'm going to be mad about that if you wake me up in the middle of the night.
[22:22.560 --> 22:26.780]  So naps are cool, but waking me up in the middle of the night is not cool in flower.
[22:26.780 --> 22:28.000]  That's a great way to remember that.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.440]  So yes, you could just go for it.
[22:30.440 --> 22:33.280]  My answer was in veg, you can play with the schedule.
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.840]  So just go for it.
[22:34.840 --> 22:36.120]  That is the short version of that answer.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.800]  I should have just stuck with that here on the show, but I hope I answered your question.
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.840]  My friend, if anybody else out there is thinking about changing the light cycle while you're
[22:42.840 --> 22:46.200]  in veg and veg, you're completely safe in flower.
[22:46.200 --> 22:51.680]  However, you do have to wait that full 12 hour sleep cycle, then get it back on the
[22:51.680 --> 22:52.680]  rhythm.
[22:52.680 --> 22:53.680]  All right.
[22:53.680 --> 22:58.880]  This next question comes from Richo Relaxo and it said, you can say my name.
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.720]  My name is Richo Relaxo.
[23:00.720 --> 23:05.820]  My question is I'm going from the veg to flower transition.
[23:05.820 --> 23:07.100]  So he's in a vegetative stage.
[23:07.100 --> 23:09.700]  He's looking to switch the lights to flower.
[23:09.700 --> 23:15.260]  Is it recommended to introduce veg from a 24 hour light schedule, which I'm currently
[23:15.260 --> 23:20.980]  on to a semi veg dark schedule before I switch to a full on flower schedule?
[23:20.980 --> 23:25.260]  And my short answer to our friend was I would just switch those bitches to flower.
[23:25.260 --> 23:27.300]  So your plants have never seen dark.
[23:27.300 --> 23:31.800]  They've been on 24 hours of light since their birth, basically since they've been cut as
[23:31.800 --> 23:33.880]  a clone, they've never seen dark.
[23:33.880 --> 23:36.100]  They don't know what dark is.
[23:36.100 --> 23:38.440]  It's not going to take a lot of darkness for them to go.
[23:38.440 --> 23:39.440]  Oh yeah.
[23:39.440 --> 23:41.440]  And they're going to trigger into flower super quickly.
[23:41.440 --> 23:44.780]  These plants are going to transition into flower really quickly.
[23:44.780 --> 23:47.640]  Sometimes it takes 12, 14 days to see the plant switch.
[23:47.640 --> 23:51.200]  I bet you these are ready and they're going to start switching in like 10 days.
[23:51.200 --> 23:54.720]  You'll start seeing female or at least if they're female plants, you'll start seeing
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.700]  pre flower male or female, whatever sex they are quite quickly because they've never gotten
[23:59.700 --> 24:01.520]  any dark and they're eager for it.
[24:01.840 --> 24:07.600]  So yeah, I would just switch them from 24 right over to that 12, 12 and you will see
[24:07.600 --> 24:10.440]  them transition quite quickly.
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.360]  Some people do that 24 hour dark period.
[24:12.360 --> 24:16.400]  If you want to do that, which might be your followup question, if you hear this, that's
[24:16.400 --> 24:17.760]  acceptable as well.
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.780]  Go from 24 hours on, give it a 24 hour dark period, then hit that 12, 12.
[24:22.780 --> 24:27.440]  They will go shebang kapow into flower super quickly because of that.
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.320]  Especially if they're big, if they're starting to show pre flower now, if they're at all
[24:30.440 --> 24:34.080]  root bound, they're going to go into flower super fast because of that.
[24:34.080 --> 24:36.080]  Yes.
[24:36.080 --> 24:40.440]  You didn't ask this, but I'm just going to interject this here because I feel like it's
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.360]  what people rely on me for.
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.240]  You are on a 24 hour and zero sleep schedule.
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.520]  They're on for 24 hours.
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.080]  Your plants are not sleeping.
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.160]  I highly recommend a little bit of a sleep schedule.
[24:52.160 --> 24:55.340]  Every living thing wants a little bit of a sleep schedule.
[24:55.340 --> 24:57.100]  I would give it just four hours.
[24:57.100 --> 24:59.180]  If you really don't want to, you don't have to.
[24:59.180 --> 25:02.260]  And if, if those plants are in there with clones or something else, I get it, but I
[25:02.260 --> 25:05.220]  would recommend four to five hours of sleep.
[25:05.220 --> 25:06.300]  Everything will do better with sleep.
[25:06.300 --> 25:10.380]  A lot of the microbial processes, a lot of the root zone processes will happen in the
[25:10.380 --> 25:11.380]  dark time.
[25:11.380 --> 25:15.140]  You'll see better shaped, better growth, healthier, happier plants.
[25:15.140 --> 25:18.180]  If you just give them a little time to take a nap, everything in nature is better with
[25:18.180 --> 25:19.620]  a little bit of sleep.
[25:19.620 --> 25:23.540]  Then my backup to that question is all of your equipment would benefit from a couple
[25:23.540 --> 25:24.940]  of hours of rest.
[25:25.260 --> 25:29.060]  Imagine not running that light for four or five hours a day, every day, however many
[25:29.060 --> 25:30.300]  lights you're running.
[25:30.300 --> 25:32.860]  You could save some electricity when that light's not running.
[25:32.860 --> 25:35.140]  You don't need the AC when the light's not running.
[25:35.140 --> 25:38.340]  You might not need that other fan when the light's not running.
[25:38.340 --> 25:40.180]  You might not need that exhaust.
[25:40.180 --> 25:44.020]  You might be able to turn off a whole bunch of shit for like four hours and save a whole
[25:44.020 --> 25:45.020]  bunch of money.
[25:45.020 --> 25:50.620]  So just an idea, just a recommendation, just a thing that I would do if it were my grow.
[25:50.620 --> 25:55.100]  All of my commercial grows get four or five hours of sleep time in the veg room, even
[25:55.100 --> 25:56.420]  in the mother area.
[25:56.420 --> 25:59.500]  A lot of times the moms and the veg plants are in the same room.
[25:59.500 --> 26:03.180]  That's why I keep them on the 20 and four so that none of those moms will try to flower
[26:03.180 --> 26:05.880]  on me early, try to keep those genetics around.
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.820]  They get tricky if you give them too much sleep time, but four hours is enough.
[26:09.820 --> 26:13.940]  Takes them like two hours to fall asleep anyway in an indoor environment without the far red.
[26:13.940 --> 26:15.780]  So give them some sleepy time.
[26:15.780 --> 26:17.700]  I think your equipment will benefit from it.
[26:17.700 --> 26:19.340]  I think your plants will enjoy it.
[26:19.340 --> 26:20.980]  I think your root zone will enjoy it.
[26:20.980 --> 26:23.180]  Your wallet will probably enjoy it.
[26:23.180 --> 26:26.000]  But with that being said, it's your grow my friend.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.300]  You do what makes you happy in your grow.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.300]  Ja love.
[26:29.300 --> 26:32.820]  A big shout out to my buddy, Richo Relaxo for the great question.
[26:32.820 --> 26:34.720]  I do appreciate that.
[26:34.720 --> 26:36.820]  Let's see how far have we gone into this?
[26:36.820 --> 26:38.900]  I think we are far enough into this podcast for it.
[26:38.900 --> 26:42.780]  It's time for me to start wrapping it up because the next question I've got will take way too
[26:42.780 --> 26:43.780]  long for this episode.
[26:43.780 --> 26:45.820]  Don't want to open that can of worms.
[26:45.820 --> 26:49.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[26:49.980 --> 26:54.700]  cutters, pollen chuckers, skateboarders, fruit booters, guitar players, and drummers, everybody
[26:54.700 --> 26:56.860]  else out there listening along or watching the video.
[26:56.860 --> 27:01.140]  I want to thank you for listening to another episode of the grow from your heart podcast.
[27:01.140 --> 27:02.620]  Had a great time recording this one.
[27:02.620 --> 27:07.020]  I had a great little vacation from doing the 420 show in the episode with Rasta Bob.
[27:07.020 --> 27:09.540]  Not a lot of work for me to do in those shows.
[27:09.540 --> 27:12.860]  I wish you knew what happened behind the scenes with that 420 show.
[27:12.860 --> 27:14.260]  It clogged up my computer.
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.520]  It was a good time.
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.520]  We got through it.
[27:16.520 --> 27:18.040]  Nobody needs to know about that.
[27:18.040 --> 27:19.720]  Anyway, thank you again for watching.
[27:19.720 --> 27:24.000]  If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, maybe it was entertaining, maybe
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.920]  you laughed a couple of times, maybe you just want to throw me a couple of bucks for all
[27:27.920 --> 27:29.760]  the time I've dedicated to the show.
[27:29.760 --> 27:30.800]  It's really easy to do that.

[28:52.800 --> 28:55.720]  You can stay updated for all things that are coming up.
[28:55.720 --> 28:56.720]  Events may be coming.
[28:56.720 --> 28:59.680]  There is a seed selling event coming up in May that I'll have more details on by the
[28:59.680 --> 29:00.680]  next episode.
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.400]  I don't know the exact time and location, but I do know the date.
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.480]  We'll get you more info really soon.
[29:06.480 --> 29:07.480]  But stay tuned.
[29:07.480 --> 29:08.480]  Join the newsletter, you guys.
[29:08.520 --> 29:10.520]  It's a crazy point of that long ramble.
[29:10.520 --> 29:12.320]  All right, that's all I've got for this episode.
[29:12.320 --> 29:14.400]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.640]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Danky Dave.
[29:17.640 --> 29:21.040]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
