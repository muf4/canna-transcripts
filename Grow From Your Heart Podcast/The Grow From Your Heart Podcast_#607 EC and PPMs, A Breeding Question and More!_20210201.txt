[00:00.640 --> 00:02.920]  All right, here we go.
[00:02.920 --> 00:04.240]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:04.240 --> 00:05.240]  I'm your host.
[00:05.240 --> 00:10.840]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 607 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:10.840 --> 00:14.040]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[00:14.040 --> 00:18.160]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout-outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:18.160 --> 00:23.040]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.280]  level or higher.
[00:24.280 --> 00:27.600]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank
[00:27.600 --> 00:30.280]  you shout-out to my friend, Billy Podunk.
[00:30.560 --> 00:32.480]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Rasta Green thumb.
[00:32.480 --> 00:35.520]  I want to send a special thank you shout-out to Dank Grows.
[00:35.520 --> 00:37.240]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Trollin.
[00:37.240 --> 00:40.920]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to my friend, Mines Eye
[00:40.920 --> 00:41.960]  Open.
[00:41.960 --> 00:43.900]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Dear Dabbie.
[00:43.900 --> 00:46.520]  I want to send a special thank you to Steven F.
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.400]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to a long-time supporter.
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.620]  Let's send a thank you to my friend Gramps Memo.
[00:52.620 --> 00:54.180]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Kojax.
[00:54.180 --> 00:58.440]  I want to send a special thank you shout-out to DontTreadOnMe420.
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.480]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[01:02.480 --> 01:05.200]  shout out to my good friend Jesse Grose.
[01:05.200 --> 01:08.940]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:08.940 --> 01:12.120]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.200]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:18.200 --> 01:20.960]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:20.960 --> 01:24.680]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.920]  make it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.280]  Once again you guys really thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.880]  I also want to thank everybody who supported my friend Crazy Hand Grose.
[01:35.880 --> 01:39.780]  On the last episode I asked you guys to go follow and visit my friend Crazy Hand Grose
[01:39.780 --> 01:40.960]  on YouTube.
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.220]  Crazy Hand sent me a great message saying how excited he was about his new followers.
[01:45.220 --> 01:48.240]  So I want to send a thank you from Crazy and myself.
[01:48.240 --> 01:51.080]  Thank you guys for supporting other members of the community.
[01:51.080 --> 01:54.320]  In this episode I'm going to ask you to follow another friend of mine.
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.920]  I highly recommend you check out Reclining with Riven.
[01:57.920 --> 01:59.680]  Riven Waters has a new channel.
[01:59.680 --> 02:00.680]  He is newly disabled.
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.800]  He is adjusting to his new life and it is very interesting and entertaining to watch.
[02:04.800 --> 02:09.240]  So I invite you guys to check out Riven, Reclining with Riven on YouTube.
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.400]  Give him a follow.
[02:10.400 --> 02:12.920]  Support a few more members of the community.
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.080]  All right what else are we going to talk about?
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.520]  I got a lot of comments and messages lately about how many times am I going to adjust
[02:18.520 --> 02:20.800]  this microphone during the podcast.
[02:20.800 --> 02:23.080]  The answer is as many as I need to.
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.800]  I've got notes on a computer.
[02:24.800 --> 02:26.120]  I've got notes on paper.
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.120]  I've got headphones on.
[02:27.120 --> 02:29.120]  I can hear exactly what's going on in the show.
[02:29.120 --> 02:32.040]  I'm doing microphone adjustments based on where I'm looking.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.840]  I'm getting the mic out of my field of view.
[02:33.840 --> 02:37.640]  But as I change my position of my face I want to move the mic as close to my mouth as I
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.480]  can to keep it sounding good.
[02:39.480 --> 02:42.600]  Trying to be a professional broadcaster that's why I got the fancy mic arm so I can keep
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.560]  this bad dog right in my face.
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.760]  So how many times am I going to move this mic?
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.120]  As many as I fucking need to.
[02:48.120 --> 02:49.600]  I'm going to make the show sound good.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.240]  If it drives you crazy I do apologize.
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.440]  But I'm trying to keep it, when I read the computer I need it kind of here.
[02:54.440 --> 02:57.760]  When I read the paper I got to move it lower to get it out of the view of the paper.
[02:57.760 --> 02:58.960]  So that's what's happening.
[02:58.960 --> 03:00.560]  I'm not completely crazy.
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.020]  Just a little bit like I said in a previous episode my mother had me tested.
[03:04.020 --> 03:05.480]  We know I'm not crazy.
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.040]  Anyway that's why I'm adjusting the mic so erratically.
[03:09.040 --> 03:12.440]  There is a method to my mic adjusting madness.
[03:12.440 --> 03:13.440]  Sorry if it drives you crazy.
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.280]  I'm trying to get it out of my field of view.
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.000]  Also try to keep myself, I can hear exactly how much of me is coming through these headphones.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.800]  I notice when I talk right here it sounds real good.
[03:21.360 --> 03:22.680]  When you get it about here it kind of fade off a little bit.
[03:22.680 --> 03:25.280]  So that's why I'm playing with the mic so much.
[03:25.280 --> 03:29.640]  You can tell the mic arm needs a little, needs some Viagra or some tightening.
[03:29.640 --> 03:31.680]  It's getting a little droopy today.
[03:31.680 --> 03:34.920]  This show is not brought to you by Bluetooth so we won't go there.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.320]  Let me get myself back on track.
[03:36.320 --> 03:37.640]  What are we going to do with this part of the show?
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.000]  This is where we are going to work into the emails and Patreon messages part of the show.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.360]  The first question on today's episode came from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.360]  website.
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.840]  If you go to my website iRegenetics.com you will find a Grow Help tab.
[03:53.840 --> 03:58.120]  On that tab if you click there you will be asked, I think we determined there are 16
[03:58.120 --> 03:59.160]  preliminary questions.
[03:59.160 --> 04:02.880]  We ask your name, what name to use on the podcast if I give you a shout out.
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.520]  We ask what strain you're growing.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.200]  Then we ask a few details about the grow.
[04:06.200 --> 04:09.440]  Then we allow you to ask a question about your grow.
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.280]  So this first question came from the Grow Help tab on iRegenetics.com and it goes a
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.280]  lot like this.
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.120]  This one they want the name on the podcast to be, they want to be called Jonathan.
[04:19.160 --> 04:22.760]  They are growing Leonardo the blueberry cookies S1 from iRegenetics.
[04:22.760 --> 04:26.040]  They're growing indoors under a high pressure sodium bulb.
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.160]  They are in flour.
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.320]  They're in week three of flour.
[04:28.320 --> 04:29.760]  They're growing in cocoa.
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.400]  They're using, here's the list of nutrients in their last feed.
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.520]  They are using GH Fluoroseries.
[04:35.520 --> 04:43.800]  They used Armorsai, CalMac, Micro, Grow, Bloom, Cool Bloom, Floralicious Plus, Diamond Nectar
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.780]  and Blackstrap Molasses.
[04:45.780 --> 04:47.760]  That is a lot of nutrients.
[04:47.760 --> 04:49.600]  That's a lot of nutrients in one feed.
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.280]  It says the pH of the last feeding was 6.0.
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.560]  I would bring that up to at least 6.2, maybe 6.4.
[04:56.560 --> 05:00.080]  Somewhere in that range would be better for your plants to absorb and uptake some of those
[05:00.080 --> 05:01.080]  nutrients.
[05:01.080 --> 05:03.960]  The PPM or the EC of the last feeding was 600.
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.680]  With all those nutrients in there, that may be acceptable.
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.000]  There was a lot of shit in there though, but you didn't use a lot of it it looks like.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.380]  The daytime temperature is 75 to 78, which is acceptable.
[05:12.380 --> 05:14.640]  Nighttime temps, 70 to 72.
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.960]  Here is where we get to the question or problem part of this message.
[05:18.960 --> 05:22.760]  It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I just want to thank you again for all that you do for the community
[05:22.760 --> 05:23.800]  and myself.
[05:23.800 --> 05:25.400]  You are very welcome.
[05:25.400 --> 05:26.440]  Thank you for thanking me.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.880]  That is like a recharge.
[05:27.880 --> 05:31.240]  You're giving me a little nutrient here to keep me going, so thank you for that.
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.760]  It says, last year I grew your Orange Gasm, which were some really great genetics.
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.760]  Thank you.
[05:36.760 --> 05:37.760]  That is one of my favorite plants.
[05:37.760 --> 05:38.760]  It's really fun to grow.
[05:38.760 --> 05:40.680]  I recommend that for everybody.
[05:40.680 --> 05:44.440]  Growers of all skill level, all environments, the Orange Gasm is a champ.
[05:45.240 --> 05:46.240]  I'm glad it went well for you.
[05:46.240 --> 05:51.000]  It said, the smell was so sweet and the plant structure was phenomenal, topped and scrogged.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.200]  That is a resilient plant.
[05:52.200 --> 05:55.560]  You can top it, you can scrog it, you can let it grow with the giant glory cola.
[05:55.560 --> 05:57.140]  It does a lot of great shit.
[05:57.140 --> 06:03.320]  It goes on to say, I'm now growing your Leonardo to hopefully get some more color in the garden.
[06:03.320 --> 06:08.080]  I'm in week three of flower and the tips of my leaves are slightly discolored and burnt.
[06:08.080 --> 06:09.600]  I feed with every watering.
[06:09.600 --> 06:14.360]  I feed one gallon at 600 ppms every other day with 25% runoff.
[06:15.280 --> 06:17.680]  I was wondering if I should do one of these three options.
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.760]  The problem is that the leaf tips are getting a little bit burnt.
[06:20.760 --> 06:22.640]  I call that getting your nails done.
[06:22.640 --> 06:26.840]  If you picture the leaf as a giant hand, the fingernail tips, they're getting a little
[06:26.840 --> 06:27.840]  bit done.
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.280]  They're just starting to get their nails painted.
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.000]  That is a sign that you may be feeding just a little bit too much or is that the sign
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.720]  that you're pushing them just enough?
[06:35.720 --> 06:36.960]  That's the decision you need to make.
[06:36.960 --> 06:41.960]  Does it look problematic or is it like if you look at an athlete and they're sweating
[06:41.960 --> 06:43.560]  and they look like they need a fucking break?
[06:43.760 --> 06:46.440]  Do your plants look like they're getting worked out and they're right at the point of like,
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.440]  oh, feel the burn?
[06:47.440 --> 06:49.600]  Or are they like, oh shit, feel the burn.
[06:49.600 --> 06:50.600]  Which one is it?
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.680]  That's the decision you need to make there.
[06:52.680 --> 06:54.800]  So they're getting their nails done.
[06:54.800 --> 06:58.560]  One thing I did notice is that's a lot of nutrients and you are feeding, you're in week
[06:58.560 --> 07:01.560]  three of flower and you're feeding the grow and bloom.
[07:01.560 --> 07:07.760]  I don't know enough about the GH flora series to know if the grow and bloom are both required,
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.240]  but I wouldn't assume with most lines that by week three, they would ask you to use the
[07:13.240 --> 07:15.760]  grow bottle and the bloom bottle.
[07:15.760 --> 07:17.400]  You may be doubling up on some things.
[07:17.400 --> 07:23.120]  You may be getting more nitrogen than necessary, but big disclaimer, I don't know this nutrient
[07:23.120 --> 07:24.120]  line.
[07:24.120 --> 07:25.120]  I don't know their nutrient calculator.
[07:25.120 --> 07:28.560]  So if it says to use the grow along with the bloom, do that.
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.880]  But by now in most lines, I would have abandoned that grow nutrient.
[07:31.880 --> 07:33.640]  We don't need this much nitrogen.
[07:33.640 --> 07:37.840]  You may be doubling up on phosphorus and potassium and getting a whole lot of nitrogen,
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.200]  which you don't need.
[07:39.200 --> 07:43.200]  So that may be one thing you could adjust just from reading your list of nutrients.
[07:43.200 --> 07:46.280]  I don't know that I would feed them that many things all at once.
[07:46.280 --> 07:50.920]  If you're feeding multiple times a week, I would go with your base nutrients, your CalMag,
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.960]  maybe the armor side every time.
[07:52.960 --> 07:55.880]  And then I would switch up like the cool bloom and the floralicious.
[07:55.880 --> 07:58.400]  I would do those on different days.
[07:58.400 --> 07:59.960]  But that that's what I would do.
[07:59.960 --> 08:01.800]  If it's working for you, bro, you keep doing your thing.
[08:01.800 --> 08:05.360]  I'm just saying that's a lot of shit to feed it all at one time, even though your PPMs
[08:05.360 --> 08:06.360]  are only 600.
[08:06.360 --> 08:09.480]  It still seems like a lot of things to go in there in one day.
[08:09.480 --> 08:14.000]  I'm going to get onto the three options which you have presented, which you think may help
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.800]  cure your nails from getting too burnt.
[08:16.800 --> 08:19.700]  It says, I was wondering if I should do one of these three options.
[08:19.700 --> 08:22.160]  Should I keep feeding as I've been doing?
[08:22.160 --> 08:25.520]  If the plants don't look like they are super distressed, if they're just getting their
[08:25.520 --> 08:28.480]  nails done, you're pushing them right to the limit.
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.840]  You're going to get a huge fat harvest, super fat, chunky buds.
[08:32.840 --> 08:34.400]  Don't push them too hard.
[08:34.400 --> 08:35.540]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[08:35.540 --> 08:39.360]  And as long as you flush properly and cure and dry them properly, they should taste good
[08:39.360 --> 08:40.520]  at the end.
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.080]  The other option is feed with half strength PPMs once or twice to do a light flush of
[08:45.080 --> 08:46.640]  the cocoa.
[08:46.640 --> 08:47.840]  You're in cocoa.
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.840]  So just one quick flush would be enough.
[08:50.840 --> 08:54.300]  And I would probably do, I wouldn't even do half strength PPMs.
[08:54.300 --> 08:55.300]  That's not even a flush.
[08:55.300 --> 08:56.300]  That's just a weak feed.
[08:56.300 --> 09:01.540]  I would just do water one time until you get like 20 to that 20% runoff is fair, which
[09:01.540 --> 09:05.100]  I don't know that that's necessary unless they're really getting cooked.
[09:05.100 --> 09:10.420]  Then it says, feed only once or twice, feed only water once or twice to flush the cocoa.
[09:10.420 --> 09:11.420]  Yeah.
[09:11.420 --> 09:13.940]  If you're going to do a flush, don't put any nutrients in there.
[09:13.940 --> 09:15.820]  That's just, I don't know.
[09:15.820 --> 09:16.820]  What's the word there?
[09:16.820 --> 09:17.820]  Counterproductive.
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.980]  You're trying to flush and you're giving it nutrients at the same time.
[09:19.980 --> 09:21.300]  So that's not going to help you.
[09:21.300 --> 09:24.740]  I would go with either option number one or option number two.
[09:24.740 --> 09:26.740]  Keep feeding as you have been.
[09:26.740 --> 09:28.220]  Maybe no, excuse me for that.
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.940]  I'm not even going to edit that.
[09:29.940 --> 09:31.820]  Maybe spread out the feedings.
[09:31.820 --> 09:34.980]  Give like I said, give one bottle on one day and the other bottle the next day.
[09:34.980 --> 09:39.780]  But with your PPMs being at 600 or your EC PPMs EC being at 600, I think you're going
[09:39.780 --> 09:41.380]  to be okay with what you're doing.
[09:41.380 --> 09:43.300]  So just pay attention to those leaves.
[09:43.300 --> 09:45.340]  Maybe reduce the feeding just a little bit.
[09:45.340 --> 09:47.920]  Maybe separate some of the bottles on different days.
[09:47.920 --> 09:51.740]  But as long as the plants aren't looking pissed off, keep doing what you're doing.
[09:51.740 --> 09:54.700]  If they do get too pissed off, reduce the feeding a little bit.
[09:54.700 --> 09:58.140]  If they stop eating, if they look like they've stalled out on you, that's when I would give
[09:58.140 --> 10:02.300]  them one flush and I would use, I think the armor, uh, don't use the armor.
[10:02.300 --> 10:04.180]  Si, I don't see an enzyme product in here.
[10:04.180 --> 10:08.860]  I would flush one time with an enzymatic product and then I would continue to feed a instead
[10:08.860 --> 10:12.180]  of 600 PPMs, maybe hit 500 and see how they respond to that.
[10:12.180 --> 10:16.540]  But I think your plants are going to be okay unless this burn is getting really, really
[10:16.540 --> 10:17.540]  ridiculous.
[10:17.540 --> 10:19.260]  I would continue to do what you're doing.
[10:19.700 --> 10:23.500]  It said also, if you can bring Sean or one of the organic guys back on the show again,
[10:23.500 --> 10:26.780]  uh, from the beginning, uh, we would love, we would be awesome.
[10:26.780 --> 10:30.060]  We would love to eventually give organic growing a try.
[10:30.060 --> 10:32.940]  I would love to get some of the more organic guys on the show.
[10:32.940 --> 10:35.500]  Uh, also make sure you check out embracing organics.
[10:35.500 --> 10:40.500]  If you're not already watching the embracing organics podcast, we, they talk a lot about
[10:40.500 --> 10:42.220]  organic growing.
[10:42.220 --> 10:45.140]  Embracing organics is a cannabis growing podcast.
[10:45.140 --> 10:46.540]  It is live on YouTube.
[10:46.860 --> 10:51.020]  It is 7 p.m. mountain time on Thursday.
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.020]  That's when we go live.
[10:52.020 --> 10:53.220]  However, the show is left up.
[10:53.220 --> 10:55.260]  It goes up to YouTube and stays up forever.
[10:55.260 --> 10:59.100]  So you can go to YouTube right now and search for embracing organics.
[10:59.100 --> 11:00.700]  I am not the host of the show.
[11:00.700 --> 11:02.780]  I'm a guest, a panel member on the show.
[11:02.780 --> 11:03.940]  We bring on a lot of other people.
[11:03.940 --> 11:05.180]  We talk about organic growing.
[11:05.180 --> 11:09.340]  We talk about all types of growing, but you can learn a lot about organics on the embracing
[11:09.340 --> 11:11.260]  organics podcast.
[11:11.260 --> 11:14.500]  And once we get some things settled in with the pandemic and all this stuff, I do plan
[11:14.500 --> 11:18.380]  on adding another microphone to the table and we will get some folks to come talk about
[11:18.380 --> 11:19.580]  organics.
[11:19.580 --> 11:21.140]  We may just have to get some people to zoom in.
[11:21.140 --> 11:24.700]  If you're an organic growing expert and you'd like to be on a podcast, send me an email.
[11:24.700 --> 11:27.420]  Email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[11:27.420 --> 11:28.940]  All right, we're going to keep moving.
[11:28.940 --> 11:30.500]  Hey bro, thank you for the great message.
[11:30.500 --> 11:32.500]  Uh, and let me know how this goes.
[11:32.500 --> 11:35.340]  Give me an update in a week or so and let me know what your plans look like.
[11:35.340 --> 11:37.320]  Let me know what you chose to do.
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.700]  Maybe include a picture, send me an email with a photo of these plants and we can make
[11:40.700 --> 11:42.420]  better decisions on what to do.
[11:42.420 --> 11:43.620]  I'm sure you saw the last episode.
[11:43.740 --> 11:47.180]  I actually dropped a photo in to show you the plant I was talking about.
[11:47.180 --> 11:49.620]  I'm trying to improve the show and that is a great way to do it.
[11:49.620 --> 11:50.700]  So send me some pics.
[11:50.700 --> 11:52.940]  I'll put them in the podcast.
[11:52.940 --> 11:53.940]  Where do we go from there?
[11:53.940 --> 11:54.980]  I've got another great message.
[11:54.980 --> 12:00.060]  This one says, yo, Ross to Jeff, I'm really enjoying the show even more so since you switched
[12:00.060 --> 12:05.020]  to being on camera instead of just having a static screen podcast format.
[12:05.020 --> 12:06.020]  Thank you.
[12:06.020 --> 12:08.780]  We've gone through a couple of different iterations of the video show.
[12:08.780 --> 12:12.620]  Now we had the flag behind us in the old crusty white wall.
[12:12.620 --> 12:15.460]  Then we moved to the office where we had the sneakers behind us.
[12:15.460 --> 12:19.400]  Now we got a new painted set with a fresh new backdrop and some brand new lighting.
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.020]  So thank you for noticing that I'm making some improvement, putting some effort into
[12:23.020 --> 12:26.520]  the show, spending that Patreon money here on the podcast.
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.300]  Thank you for noticing that and I'm glad it keeps your attention a little bit better.
[12:30.300 --> 12:33.180]  It says, I have a question about selfing.
[12:33.180 --> 12:37.820]  And of course selfing is when we take a plant and we cut a clone of that same plant.
[12:37.820 --> 12:40.740]  We reverse one with a silver thiosulfate solution.
[12:40.740 --> 12:42.660]  That plant will then create female pollen.
[12:42.660 --> 12:48.380]  You put that female pollen on a clone of the same plant to make seeds that are S1s.
[12:48.380 --> 12:49.380]  That is selfing.
[12:49.380 --> 12:52.780]  We're going to talk more about that in the message, but it says, I have a question about
[12:52.780 --> 12:53.780]  selfing.
[12:53.780 --> 12:58.620]  If you take a male and a female of the same strain and you make seeds, you get an F2 with
[12:58.620 --> 13:00.940]  a lot of variation, right?
[13:00.940 --> 13:01.940]  That is accurate.
[13:01.940 --> 13:07.560]  A male and a female of the same strain, you make seeds, you get an F2 with a lot of variation.
[13:07.560 --> 13:08.780]  That is accurate.
[13:09.780 --> 13:13.780]  Whereas S1 seeds, this is where we're going to have some different conversation.
[13:13.780 --> 13:18.820]  Whereas with S1 seeds should show a lot less variation because all of the genes are from
[13:18.820 --> 13:20.460]  the same plant.
[13:20.460 --> 13:27.180]  What if you grew out two females of the same strain from seed, reverse one and breed them?
[13:27.180 --> 13:31.460]  Will you get the same type of variation as an F2?
[13:31.460 --> 13:35.940]  And would it be called an S2 or would you just call them feminized F2s?
[13:35.940 --> 13:38.120]  Thanks for all of the knowledge.
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.920]  Thank you from SpankyNuts420.
[13:40.920 --> 13:41.920]  This is a great question.
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.760]  There are some things to think about here.
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.200]  So let's kind of outline what he's trying to do here, what our listener is trying to
[13:47.200 --> 13:48.200]  ask about.
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.000]  They want to grow a pack of seeds.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.700]  In that pack of seeds, there are going to be multiple phenotypes.
[13:52.700 --> 13:56.600]  They want to find a phenotype number one that's a female and phenotype number two that's a
[13:56.600 --> 13:57.600]  female.
[13:57.600 --> 13:58.960]  They've got two different phenotypes.
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.860]  So that's a good start for this.
[14:00.860 --> 14:05.760]  What if we took two females of the same strain, reverse one of them, and then put the pollen
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.840]  on the other one?
[14:08.840 --> 14:11.040]  That is sort of an S2.
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.920]  I'm going to call that an R1.
[14:14.920 --> 14:17.560]  That might be like an R1 inbred line.
[14:17.560 --> 14:18.560]  I'm going to call it.
[14:18.560 --> 14:20.760]  I don't know what the official name for that is because we don't do that.
[14:20.760 --> 14:22.320]  Nobody really does that sort of stuff.
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.740]  I've done something like that and never knew what to call it.
[14:25.740 --> 14:31.740]  It's not a self because in my vocabulary, the way that I see the word self is it's got
[14:31.740 --> 14:34.040]  to be on the same plant.
[14:34.040 --> 14:36.220]  It's got to be a clone of the same thing.
[14:36.220 --> 14:40.480]  So this is going to be an R1, but it's going to be, I'm just going to pick a strain.
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.520]  I'm going to call it Spanky's Nuts 420 OG.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.080]  That's the strain we're working with.
[14:45.080 --> 14:49.840]  This is going to be a Spanky's Nuts 420 OG R1.
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.120]  It's a reversal because we used technically two different plants.
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.320]  They may be the same, the same strain, the same genetics, the same, all that, but they
[14:57.320 --> 14:59.340]  are different phenotypes.
[14:59.340 --> 15:03.000]  So we're going to see different representations in the progeny.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.800]  You're going to see a little bit of this phenotype and a little bit of this phenotype.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.600]  Even though they're the same strain, they are different plants.
[15:09.600 --> 15:12.600]  It's like taking two different plants.
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.720]  They have the same parents, so you're not going to see as much weird grandparent expression.
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.120]  You may see some crazy, crazy recessive great grandparent genes expressed in that, but I
[15:23.120 --> 15:25.640]  don't think we would call that an S2.
[15:25.640 --> 15:31.000]  I think that would be an R1 or some sort of an R1 inbred project is what that would be.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.800]  I would just call it an R1 and explain to people.
[15:33.800 --> 15:40.320]  I wouldn't label it like Spanky's Nuts 420 number one cross to Spanky's Nuts 420 number
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.720]  two and then just label it as an R1 because that is a reversal.
[15:44.720 --> 15:47.320]  I think that's the way we would do that.
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.680]  Let me make sure I covered this question.
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.680]  Let's see.
[15:50.680 --> 15:52.340]  The S1s would show a lot less variation.
[15:52.340 --> 15:54.800]  What if you grow out two females of the same strain, reverse one, and breed them?
[15:54.800 --> 15:56.440]  Will you get the same type of variation?
[15:56.440 --> 15:57.440]  All right.
[15:57.440 --> 16:04.160]  So I think not as much variation as the F2 because there aren't as many options.
[16:04.160 --> 16:06.760]  With the F2, you know what the mom and the dad are going to look like.
[16:06.760 --> 16:10.760]  You're going to see mom and dad options, and the grandparents definitely give you more
[16:10.760 --> 16:11.760]  options.
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.040]  We don't have basically different grandparents here, so that recessive trait that pops up
[16:16.040 --> 16:21.520]  from the grandparents, it's going to be very, very similar, but you may see great grandparents
[16:21.520 --> 16:23.680]  is what I think I was alluding to earlier.
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.600]  You may see weird great grandparents traits come out of that, that you have no idea what
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.320]  you're expecting there.
[16:29.320 --> 16:31.600]  Maybe great, great grandparents may be expressed in that.
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.800]  When you go playing with genetics like this, this is when we open up weird stuff.
[16:35.800 --> 16:37.440]  That's why the F2 shows a lot of variation.
[16:37.440 --> 16:39.520]  The F1 comes with a lot of vigor.
[16:39.520 --> 16:41.840]  The F2, we really start opening up variation.
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.880]  F3, hopefully you've done selection to start narrowing that down.
[16:45.880 --> 16:50.400]  When we're working with fems, we don't have as many pieces to our puzzle, as many colors
[16:50.400 --> 16:53.000]  to our palette, as many ingredients to our recipe.
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.620]  You shouldn't open as many things, but that's when you start seeing background things pop
[16:57.620 --> 16:58.920]  up that you never expected.
[16:58.920 --> 17:00.480]  This is a fun project.
[17:00.480 --> 17:01.600]  It's something that you should do.
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.160]  If you haven't already done this, do it, bro, and tell me how this goes.
[17:05.160 --> 17:08.840]  I would love to do it for you, but I honestly don't have time or space.
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.080]  I think you're going to see variation, but it's going to be less variation, and you may
[17:13.080 --> 17:14.960]  see great grandparents.
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.440]  At first, I said grandparents, but then I had to draw the family tree in my head and
[17:18.440 --> 17:19.440]  talk it out.
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.360]  You may see great grandparents come through in some of the rare phenotypes, but it's technically
[17:24.360 --> 17:28.800]  not an S1 because you're using different plants.
[17:28.800 --> 17:29.800]  That is an R1.
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.400]  I hope I'm saying that correctly.
[17:32.400 --> 17:33.400]  It's an R1.
[17:33.400 --> 17:34.400]  It's a reversal.
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.960]  You'll see number one and number two in there, but you're going to get a lot of them that
[17:38.960 --> 17:42.920]  look 50-50 of number one and number two, a lot that look like number one, a lot that
[17:42.920 --> 17:46.920]  look like number two, but then you're going to see some outliers that look like whatever
[17:46.920 --> 17:48.240]  that strain was crossed with.
[17:48.240 --> 17:49.240]  You're going to get some weirdness there.
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.040]  You may get some real mutants out of it too because you're playing with feminized genetics.
[17:54.040 --> 17:56.840]  That's a really fun conversation that I would like to open up with other people.
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.840]  I wish this was a live chat.
[17:57.840 --> 17:59.200]  I had some more people on there.
[17:59.200 --> 18:03.080]  If you've got input, feedback, questions, corrections, comments, concerns on this topic,
[18:03.080 --> 18:04.240]  I would love to hear it.
[18:04.240 --> 18:07.640]  Again, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[18:07.640 --> 18:10.320]  All right, I've got one more email.
[18:10.320 --> 18:13.760]  This one could get kind of long because there are a lot of details to this one.
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.040]  This one is a question about TDS, EC, and PPMs.
[18:18.040 --> 18:19.680]  What are all of those things?
[18:19.680 --> 18:21.400]  What does all of that stuff mean?
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.440]  I tried to make some notes so that we can keep this one concise.
[18:24.440 --> 18:27.720]  The question came from our friend, Sequoia Organic Farms.
[18:27.720 --> 18:30.920]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I'm a new supporter from Colorado.
[18:30.920 --> 18:31.920]  Check us out.
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.680]  We are Sequoia Organic Farms.
[18:33.680 --> 18:36.160]  They spell Sequoia differently than you probably assume.
[18:36.160 --> 18:42.160]  It's S-E-Q-U-O-Y-A-H, and then organic farms the traditional way.
[18:42.160 --> 18:43.360]  It's all one word.
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.000]  It goes on to say, I can't tell you enough how much your knowledge means to everyone.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  Thank you, bro.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  I appreciate that.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.520]  It says, thank you for all of the positive energy, and keep killing the game.
[18:53.520 --> 18:54.520]  Thank you, bro.
[18:54.520 --> 18:57.880]  Just being me, trying to do what I do, trying to get these seeds and the message out to
[18:57.880 --> 18:59.220]  the people that need it.
[18:59.220 --> 19:00.500]  Thank you for noticing the hard work.
[19:00.500 --> 19:04.400]  It says, it's people like you who inspire people like me.
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.080]  To tell you the truth, bro, it's people like you who inspire people like me.
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.080]  Keep it going.
[19:09.080 --> 19:10.080]  We'll keep it going back and forth.
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.200]  It says, I do have a quick question for you that I hope you can talk about on the podcast.
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.400]  I do apologize if you've already covered this in a previous episode.
[19:18.400 --> 19:19.760]  That is okay if I already have.
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.240]  With 600 episodes, I realize people probably don't go back and listen to all 600.
[19:25.240 --> 19:28.480]  If they've got a question, it's probably easier just to redo it.
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.280]  Since we're on this brand new, awesome video format, why not have a new episode on the
[19:32.280 --> 19:34.600]  old topics on the video format anyway?
[19:34.600 --> 19:37.080]  If you already asked it, or if it's already been covered, that's okay.
[19:37.080 --> 19:38.780]  I'm going to re-answer it for you.
[19:38.780 --> 19:44.580]  It says, can you dive into the specifics of PPM, TDS, and EC?
[19:44.580 --> 19:46.980]  What are they and what are their relations?
[19:46.980 --> 19:49.860]  All right, there are multiple parts to this question.
[19:49.860 --> 19:51.060]  I'm not going to answer all three.
[19:51.060 --> 19:52.300]  I'll read them quickly for you though.
[19:52.300 --> 19:55.300]  It says, I'm an organic no-till living soil grower.
[19:55.300 --> 19:59.220]  I would love some tips on how to specifically water peat-based super soils.
[19:59.220 --> 20:02.180]  I seem to be an over-waterer.
[20:02.180 --> 20:05.420]  My advice to that, you already know that you're an over-waterer.
[20:05.420 --> 20:06.500]  Wait another day, bro.
[20:06.500 --> 20:08.220]  Wait until that plant looks like it's thirsty.
[20:08.220 --> 20:09.220]  It will let you know.
[20:09.220 --> 20:10.320]  It will tell you.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.320]  Then water it.
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.320]  That's easy enough.
[20:12.320 --> 20:16.620]  Then it says, any organic references to increase yields would be awesome.
[20:16.620 --> 20:18.860]  Maybe a whole organic episode.
[20:18.860 --> 20:21.300]  I did invite somebody to come on and do some organics.
[20:21.300 --> 20:24.860]  Once again, I'll recommend the Embracing Organics show.
[20:24.860 --> 20:30.740]  Then I'm not your organic expert, but for organic, I think I can recommend Budswell.
[20:30.740 --> 20:35.660]  I think Budswell is an organic product and I think that will help with your bloom booster
[20:35.660 --> 20:36.660]  situation.
[20:36.660 --> 20:38.500]  I think you should check out Budswell, the liquid.
[20:38.500 --> 20:39.920]  Make sure that's organic before you use it.
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.060]  Do not take my word for it.
[20:41.060 --> 20:43.080]  I'm giving you a disclaimer right now.
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.180]  Not 100% sure, but that's what I would recommend.
[20:45.180 --> 20:47.020]  If it is organic, do that.
[20:47.020 --> 20:50.100]  Now let's get into the part of the question you actually wanted some help with that I'm
[20:50.100 --> 20:52.400]  able to provide help for.
[20:52.400 --> 20:55.700]  Let's talk about what are TDS, PPMs, and EC.
[20:55.700 --> 20:57.380]  What do all these letters mean?
[20:57.380 --> 21:02.980]  TDS is actually what we are measuring when we measure PPM and EC.
[21:02.980 --> 21:06.700]  TDS simply stands for total dissolved solids.
[21:06.700 --> 21:11.060]  There are a couple of ways to measure the total dissolved solids in a solution.
[21:11.060 --> 21:15.940]  What we are going to do, we're going to have a solution, a container of water and nutrients.
[21:15.940 --> 21:17.820]  That is our solution in this case.
[21:17.820 --> 21:21.220]  We want to know how much nutrient is in our water.
[21:21.220 --> 21:26.460]  The water, if you've got RO water, it should be zero PPMs, zero EC.
[21:26.460 --> 21:28.580]  There are zero total dissolved solids in there.
[21:28.580 --> 21:30.740]  Now we're going to add our nutrients into it.
[21:30.740 --> 21:36.460]  There are several reasons why it's good to know what your EC or your PPMs are.
[21:36.460 --> 21:40.540]  First of all, if you're burning the plants like our one listener may be doing, we can
[21:40.540 --> 21:44.100]  see what the TDS is, the PPMs, and we can lower that.
[21:44.100 --> 21:47.600]  Or if we're getting a perfect crop, we can see that it was perfect, we can write that
[21:47.600 --> 21:49.500]  down and we can repeat that.
[21:49.500 --> 21:53.920]  Or if the plants need more nutrients, we can write down that 600 was a little low, let's
[21:53.920 --> 21:55.700]  give it 700 next time.
[21:55.700 --> 22:00.340]  It's a good gauge, a good guide, a good reference point, and it can teach you a lot about your
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.440]  plants and what they're uptaking.
[22:02.440 --> 22:05.820]  So let's talk a little bit more specifically about what these things are.
[22:05.820 --> 22:10.100]  TDS is the total amount of dissolved solids in your bucket with your water.
[22:10.100 --> 22:12.180]  How many dissolved solids are in there?
[22:12.180 --> 22:15.980]  The units of measure, the common units of measure of those total dissolved solids are
[22:15.980 --> 22:18.420]  PPMs and EC.
[22:18.420 --> 22:22.300]  PPM stands for particles per million.
[22:22.300 --> 22:28.820]  So we've got this many particles of nutrients per million particles of water in that solution.
[22:29.820 --> 22:33.980]  EC stands for electrical conductivity.
[22:33.980 --> 22:36.380]  Let's talk about electrical conductivity.
[22:36.380 --> 22:40.020]  Electrical conductivity is, and I got this from the internet, shout out to Google.
[22:40.020 --> 22:45.820]  It says electrical conductivity is the measurement of the ability of something to conduct electricity.
[22:45.820 --> 22:49.180]  I know that sounds very basic, it sounds kind of redundant.
[22:49.180 --> 22:52.540]  Electrical conductivity is the ability to conduct electricity.
[22:52.540 --> 22:57.980]  The salts that we use for fertilizers do have the ability to conduct electricity.
[22:57.980 --> 23:02.180]  All those salts you add in there are conductive to electricity is what I'm saying.
[23:02.180 --> 23:06.900]  The EC measures how much electricity they are able to conduct.
[23:06.900 --> 23:08.620]  It's not like you can plug in a light with them.
[23:08.620 --> 23:14.420]  That's very small amounts of electrical conductivity, but that is what the EC stands for.
[23:14.420 --> 23:16.620]  PPM, excuse me with that.
[23:16.620 --> 23:18.860]  Let me fix my voice and try that again.
[23:18.860 --> 23:21.220]  I'm not a 12 year old, I promise.
[23:22.220 --> 23:29.500]  Particles per million meters actually measure in EC and do a mathematical equation and convert
[23:29.500 --> 23:31.580]  that to PPM.
[23:31.580 --> 23:36.460]  In my opinion, EC is much more reliable than particles per million.
[23:36.460 --> 23:39.940]  It's more used in science, it's more used in large scale application.
[23:39.940 --> 23:44.500]  You'll more likely see EC as a unit of measurement over particles per million.
[23:44.500 --> 23:48.700]  Also, there are different conversion rates.
[23:48.740 --> 23:52.980]  Just like the imperial and metric system, there are different conversions.
[23:52.980 --> 23:57.500]  In different regions, different countries, different continents, particles per million
[23:57.500 --> 24:02.180]  will be converted differently to EC in their conversion calculator.
[24:02.180 --> 24:04.340]  They use a different number to do the conversion.
[24:04.340 --> 24:09.780]  Unless you know where your nutrient company is basing their conversion on, your PPM recommendations
[24:09.780 --> 24:12.020]  may be way off.
[24:12.020 --> 24:15.860]  Particles per million are telling us how much stuff is in that water.
[24:15.900 --> 24:19.900]  Electrical conductivity is basically telling us how much stuff is in that water, but more
[24:19.900 --> 24:21.220]  specifically.
[24:21.220 --> 24:26.740]  That makes it easier to remember, to notate how much nutrient is in our solution.
[24:26.740 --> 24:30.860]  You may be mixing in five or six different products into your solution.
[24:30.860 --> 24:35.660]  You can always take your EC meter, start off and see what your starting water EC is.
[24:35.660 --> 24:37.300]  If you're using RO, it's going to be zero.
[24:37.300 --> 24:41.820]  If you're using tap water, you're going to have a few PPMs or a little bit of EC in that
[24:41.820 --> 24:42.820]  water.
[24:42.820 --> 24:45.740]  Now, add your nitrogen or your base nutrient.
[24:45.740 --> 24:49.860]  Throw your EC meter around in there and you can see what your particles per million or
[24:49.860 --> 24:53.660]  your electrical conductivity level of your base nutrient is.
[24:53.660 --> 24:57.620]  A lot of people like to measure the EC and particles per million of their CalMag.
[24:57.620 --> 25:00.840]  A lot of plants are very critical on how much CalMag they use.
[25:00.840 --> 25:06.380]  This is a really good way to dial in exactly how much CalMag or calcium or magnesium or
[25:06.380 --> 25:08.980]  whatever individual bottled nutrient you've got.
[25:08.980 --> 25:13.620]  You can definitely measure out exactly how much of that is going into your solution by
[25:13.620 --> 25:18.540]  measuring your EC and your PPM while you are adding that product to the reservoir.
[25:18.540 --> 25:22.780]  You can actually have the meter in the reservoir, pour it in there, see what it is before you
[25:22.780 --> 25:24.420]  pour it and see what it is after you pour it.
[25:24.420 --> 25:27.540]  Now you know I've got 600 PPMs of nitrogen.
[25:27.540 --> 25:28.860]  Now you can pour in your CalMag.
[25:28.860 --> 25:33.180]  If your goal is 200 particles per million of the CalMag bottle, pour that in until you
[25:33.180 --> 25:37.700]  see 800 PPMs of stuff or whatever number you want on your EC screen.
[25:37.700 --> 25:42.540]  You can do exactly how much of each nutrient bottle you want at that rate.
[25:42.540 --> 25:44.540]  I highly recommend using EC.
[25:44.540 --> 25:48.220]  I write down the EC of my solution before it goes into the plants.
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.020]  I write down the EC of my solution that runs out of my plants.
[25:51.020 --> 25:55.260]  I also write down the pH of that solution before I feed it and what comes out of the
[25:55.260 --> 25:56.540]  bottom of the plants.
[25:56.540 --> 26:01.540]  I also write down every single nutrient that went into that nutrient solution.
[26:01.540 --> 26:06.780]  If I put 100 mils of one thing, 80 mils of another, 20 mils of another, and then a bunch
[26:06.780 --> 26:10.820]  of grams of recharge, I write that all down on a spreadsheet.
[26:10.820 --> 26:16.900]  Then I write down my EC in, my PPMs in, my pH in, and then I write down the EC out and
[26:16.900 --> 26:21.100]  the pH out so I've got a good documentation of what happened.
[26:21.100 --> 26:24.180]  Then if something goes wrong, I can look back at my feed chart.
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.180]  I can look at the plants.
[26:25.180 --> 26:31.020]  I can look at my paperwork, and that helps me decide, determine, decipher what may have
[26:31.020 --> 26:33.660]  gone wrong through a process of elimination.
[26:33.660 --> 26:34.980]  Maybe we sprayed something.
[26:34.980 --> 26:36.360]  That's written down also.
[26:36.360 --> 26:38.220]  Maybe we defoliated too heavily.
[26:38.220 --> 26:39.220]  That's written down also.
[26:39.220 --> 26:40.580]  I take a lot of notes.
[26:40.580 --> 26:43.340]  I use the EC as a reference guide.
[26:43.340 --> 26:46.620]  I always write down my EC of my solution in and out.
[26:46.620 --> 26:52.320]  Then we can use that data, like I said earlier, to either correct an issue or to repeat success.
[26:52.320 --> 26:55.740]  If you've got a problem, the numbers will tell you maybe where your problem happened.
[26:55.740 --> 26:58.540]  You can see the pH coming out was a little funky.
[26:58.540 --> 27:00.180]  The EC coming out was a little funky.
[27:00.180 --> 27:01.880]  It was too high, too low.
[27:01.880 --> 27:04.220]  Maybe one of them went one way, one went the other.
[27:04.220 --> 27:06.260]  That'll tell you what's happening with your runoff.
[27:06.260 --> 27:08.140]  The runoff reports are a whole other podcast.
[27:08.140 --> 27:09.260]  I think I may have done that.
[27:09.260 --> 27:11.380]  If not, I need to do an updated version.
[27:11.380 --> 27:14.060]  Even if I did, I should probably do an updated version.
[27:14.060 --> 27:19.620]  You can use that data to either correct or adjust or mimic your previous results.
[27:19.620 --> 27:23.940]  When you're working with standard operating procedures in a large-scale environment, repeatable
[27:23.940 --> 27:25.340]  results are what we're after.
[27:25.340 --> 27:29.860]  If we nail this crop, we definitely want to nail that crop next time, get a bonus, reach
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.900]  potency goals, reach harvest weights.
[27:31.900 --> 27:33.340]  Everybody gets a bonus.
[27:33.340 --> 27:34.480]  Everybody's after a bonus check.
[27:34.480 --> 27:36.620]  All the patients get a better product.
[27:36.620 --> 27:38.700]  That's what happens when we take good notes.
[27:38.700 --> 27:44.300]  It's my recommendation to stick with electrical conductivity as it is a little bit more accurate.
[27:44.300 --> 27:47.580]  When you're measuring each nutrient, you can do your PPMs that way if you want to.
[27:47.580 --> 27:48.900]  It is easier to tell.
[27:48.900 --> 27:51.820]  The numbers are more there.
[27:51.820 --> 27:54.260]  You're using 600, 700, 800.
[27:54.260 --> 27:57.180]  When you're using the EC, it's going to be 0.8, 0.9.
[27:57.180 --> 28:00.820]  It's easier to use the other scale as you're measuring each thing individually.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.980]  Overall, go with the EC.
[28:02.980 --> 28:03.980]  Find your zone.
[28:03.980 --> 28:05.420]  Find what your plants love.
[28:05.420 --> 28:07.380]  Stick with that and repeat it.
[28:07.380 --> 28:11.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[28:11.020 --> 28:15.220]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all you beautiful growers and smokers out there,
