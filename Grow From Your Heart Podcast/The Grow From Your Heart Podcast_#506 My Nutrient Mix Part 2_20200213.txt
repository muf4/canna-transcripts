[00:48.920 --> 00:54.780]  smoking today. I've been taking dabs of lemon wreath live batter from our friends at Green
[00:54.780 --> 01:00.340]  Dot Labs. This is a blend of Cambrouillet and secret Cushmints. On the package, the
[01:00.340 --> 01:05.300]  flavor is described as lemon rind and tea tree oil. I will agree with that. I'm going
[01:05.300 --> 01:10.620]  to say there's also an extra funk to it. I really enjoy the flavor and buzz from the
[01:10.620 --> 01:15.300]  lemon wreath live batter. It obviously has me talkative. It's got me in a really good
[01:15.300 --> 01:19.220]  mood. So this is going to be a wonderful podcast.
[01:19.220 --> 01:23.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be the second installment of my mix episode.
[01:23.460 --> 01:28.700]  In this episode, we're going to focus on my flowering nutrient mix. Before we get
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.700]  to that part of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of the people who help us out

[03:01.760 --> 03:09.660]  and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, it is time to jump into another mix episode.
[03:09.660 --> 03:15.380]  In the previous episode, I went into great detail on my vegetative nutrient mix. So it
[03:15.380 --> 03:22.020]  is time to discuss my flowering nutrient mix. I said this in the last episode, but
[03:22.020 --> 03:26.420]  I want to repeat it before I start talking about my mix.
[03:26.420 --> 03:34.860]  This nutrient mix works for me, in my environment, with my plants. I don't know what strains
[03:34.860 --> 03:38.760]  you're running. I don't know what kind of lights you're using. I don't know how much
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.460]  airflow is in your room. I don't know what's happening in your environment. This works
[03:44.540 --> 03:51.700]  beautifully for me on many different setups. I run this nutrient mix in a commercial environment,
[03:51.700 --> 03:58.140]  and I run this nutrient mix in my own personal environment, and it works very well. Pay attention
[03:58.140 --> 04:03.540]  to your plants. No matter what I teach you, no matter what the bottles teach you, no matter
[04:03.540 --> 04:08.300]  what the meters in the room tell you, the plants are the boss.
[04:08.300 --> 04:13.420]  Pay attention to them and adjust accordingly. Don't say, Rasta Jeff said to feed it cow
[04:13.460 --> 04:18.820]  mag, I'm going to give it cow mag. Don't do that. I cannot see your plants. If the plants
[04:18.820 --> 04:24.460]  have a problem, let them tell you what the problem is and adjust. Don't force the plants
[04:24.460 --> 04:29.660]  to do anything because it will not work for you. So keep in mind that everything I am
[04:29.660 --> 04:34.460]  teaching you works for me. You have got to pay close attention to the plants and make
[04:34.460 --> 04:39.860]  adjustments. There will be game time decisions. There will be adjustments. And I do encourage
[04:39.860 --> 04:46.220]  you to adjust and custom tailor this recipe to work for your grow.
[04:46.220 --> 04:50.780]  And now the last disclaimer that I'm going to make before I jump into this is nobody
[04:50.780 --> 04:55.300]  pays me to talk about any of these nutrients that I'm going to tell you about. This is
[04:55.300 --> 05:00.760]  all stuff that I have tested and experimented with, and this is what I am using in commercial
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.900]  grows throughout Colorado. This is what I have taught people in commercial grows in
[05:05.900 --> 05:12.100]  Oklahoma to run. This is what people in Missouri are running in commercial cultivation facilities.
[05:12.100 --> 05:17.220]  This is what people in Massachusetts and New Mexico are running based on my consultations
[05:17.220 --> 05:23.280]  and my setups and my experience. I've got people all over the country running this exact
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.540]  nutrient mix and the table type of setup I explained in the previous episode. So my point
[05:28.540 --> 05:35.380]  is nobody pays me. This is all stuff that I use because it works for me. Again, it works
[05:35.380 --> 05:41.100]  for me. You may have to adjust some things to work for you. Your environment may be different.
[05:41.100 --> 05:45.540]  Your lights may be different. Your watering style is probably different. Your strains
[05:45.540 --> 05:51.500]  and your genetics are most likely completely different. So you will need to make adjustments.
[05:51.500 --> 05:57.860]  Now with all of that being said, let's dive into my nutrient mix.
[05:57.860 --> 06:02.300]  My flowering plants are in three gallon pots. They're filled with cocoa that is amended
[06:02.300 --> 06:06.940]  with perlite and persolite. We've gone over that in the last episode. I'm going to water
[06:06.940 --> 06:14.700]  until I get about 20% runoff. Every time I water, I want approximately 20% runoff. At
[06:14.700 --> 06:19.180]  the beginning of the flowering phase, I am generally watering my plants every morning.
[06:19.180 --> 06:22.980]  I like to water right when the lights come on. So as soon as the lights come on at eight
[06:22.980 --> 06:27.260]  or nine o'clock or maybe seven o'clock in some places, we've got a nutrient mix ready
[06:27.260 --> 06:31.980]  to go. The lights click on and those plants get water. I like to water them right when
[06:31.980 --> 06:36.820]  the lights come on. Then as they get bigger later in the flowering cycle, they may need
[06:36.820 --> 06:41.240]  another watering before we leave for the end of the day. So I like to water them one more
[06:41.240 --> 06:45.300]  time around five or six o'clock so that when we come back the next morning, they're not
[06:45.300 --> 06:50.540]  crispy and dead. So I'm generally watering these plants once or twice a day. They get
[06:50.540 --> 06:53.280]  nutrients at every watering.
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.180]  In the previous episode, I talked about different styles of mixing your nutrients. You can do
[06:58.180 --> 07:02.700]  the Monday blast where you get everything in the nutrient tank Monday and the plants
[07:02.700 --> 07:06.680]  get fed everything on Monday. Then the rest of the week, they get base nutrients and maybe
[07:06.680 --> 07:12.160]  some cow mag. Or you can do the thing that I like to do where you feed them a base mix
[07:12.160 --> 07:17.560]  every single day and then you add a boost every day on top of that. Because in my environment,
[07:17.560 --> 07:22.200]  like I said, I'm watering every day. So I'm able to mix up a different mix on a daily
[07:22.200 --> 07:26.980]  basis and feed my plants exactly what they want every single day.
[07:26.980 --> 07:30.360]  Maybe you don't have access to your plants in your reservoir and your rooms as often
[07:30.360 --> 07:35.080]  as I do. So you've got to either mix up on Monday and put everything in there and feed
[07:35.080 --> 07:39.100]  it throughout the week. Maybe you can feed it one big fat heavy feed on Monday and then
[07:39.100 --> 07:44.280]  just supplement with just base nutrients through the week. Or maybe you're able to do the big
[07:44.280 --> 07:48.880]  base nutrient mix with a boost every day like I like to do. That is something you're going
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.800]  to have to figure out.
[07:50.800 --> 07:55.320]  In my example, I'm going to tell you what I use for base nutrients. Then I will tell
[07:55.340 --> 08:01.580]  you what I use for boost nutrients. It is up to you to decide how you want to apply
[08:01.580 --> 08:08.580]  those boosts. Again, I mix a base mix every single day. Then I rotate boost products throughout
[08:10.740 --> 08:16.180]  the week to add to that. So we'll say Monday, I'll mix up my base. We'll say that my base
[08:16.180 --> 08:23.180]  is five grams of veg bloom powder, one milliliter of liquid lightning start, and five milliliters
[08:24.160 --> 08:29.800]  of Ruby. That is my base. Then throughout the week, I will rotate through boosts. So
[08:29.800 --> 08:35.720]  we'll say day one, we will use Plus Life. On day two, I will use CalMag. And on day
[08:35.720 --> 08:41.200]  three, I will use Lightning Start. Then we'll just go back to the top of the list and repeat
[08:41.200 --> 08:44.660]  that through the entire week as we feed the plants.
[08:44.660 --> 08:50.080]  That is how I do my boosts. You may, like I said a moment ago, need to mix up your reservoir
[08:50.140 --> 08:55.020]  and put that five grams of base nutrient in there, the lightning start, the Ruby, and
[08:55.020 --> 09:00.940]  you may be adding all of those boosters all at one time. That is up to you. As long as
[09:00.940 --> 09:06.300]  the plants accept your feeding properly, you are not doing it wrong. Do what works for
[09:06.300 --> 09:12.540]  your lifestyle, your grow style, your gardening style, and most of all, do what works for
[09:12.540 --> 09:14.460]  the plants.
[09:14.460 --> 09:19.940]  Throughout the flowering phase, I do recommend that we adjust our pH of our nutrient solution
[09:19.960 --> 09:26.040]  to somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4. That's an ideal range. Since we are working in cocoa
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.440]  and we're using a lot of nutrients and we've got a lot of fulvic acid, that will be perfect
[09:30.440 --> 09:38.360]  for our plants. So through the entire process, adjust your pH solution to 6.1 to 6.4.
[09:38.360 --> 09:44.600]  Now let's talk about the actual nutrients I am using in my flowering nutrient solution.
[09:44.600 --> 09:50.020]  I am going to go through this week by week. We are going to do a nine-week schedule. And
[09:50.020 --> 09:56.600]  of course, the last 10 to 14 days of that schedule will be a flush with probably no
[09:56.600 --> 10:01.720]  nutrients, maybe a couple of very specific products if you want to add them. Once we
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.180]  get through the whole lesson, I will talk about a few other options you can add if it
[10:06.180 --> 10:10.900]  suits your budget and if it suits your experience level and if you're comfortable adding a few
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.280]  more things.
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.720]  So I feel like I've been teasing it. I feel like I've been building a lot of hype. Let's
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.760]  actually discuss my flowering nutrient mix. Here we go. In the previous mix episode, I
[10:21.760 --> 10:28.020]  talk about having two different base mixes. We are going to do a very similar idea in
[10:28.020 --> 10:34.500]  this episode. And again, it is very important that you do not double up on your base mixes.
[10:34.500 --> 10:42.260]  What I mean by that is, I like to use veg bloom powdered nutrients as my base in some
[10:42.260 --> 10:49.200]  facilities. In other facilities, I am using all New Millennium bottled nutrients. Where
[10:49.200 --> 10:57.320]  I'm using the veg bloom powdered nutrients, I will subtract the New Millennium base mix.
[10:57.320 --> 11:03.500]  So I have two different options for base mixes, and I will make them both very clear in each
[11:03.500 --> 11:09.060]  week's mix recipe. Most of you have probably already made a decision. You know if you're
[11:09.060 --> 11:14.000]  going to use the veg bloom powdered nutrients or you know if you're going to use the New
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.980]  Millennium liquid bottled nutrients. So as soon as you hear the appropriate mix, you
[11:18.980 --> 11:25.700]  will know which recipe to follow. I will make it very clear for you. So please follow along.
[11:25.700 --> 11:33.380]  Here we go. For week one, we've got two options for base mixes. Let's start with that 5 gram
[11:33.780 --> 11:40.780]  of veg bloom base mix per gallon of water. So we've got 5 grams of veg bloom per gallon.
[11:41.820 --> 11:48.820]  Or if you are going to use the New Millennium bottled nutrients, replace that 5 grams with
[11:48.820 --> 11:55.820]  4 milliliters of Equinox, 6 milliliters of Summer Shift, and 6 milliliters of Autumn
[11:56.660 --> 12:03.660]  Gold per gallon of water. Now if you use the veg bloom or the New Millennium, either way
[12:04.860 --> 12:11.860]  you are going to add 1 milliliter of Lightning Start and 5 milliliters of Ruby. So just to
[12:12.540 --> 12:19.540]  recap, the liquid formula is 4 milliliters of Equinox, 6 milliliters of Summer Shift,
[12:20.540 --> 12:27.540]  and 6 milliliters of Autumn Gold. That is your base. Then you will add 1 milliliter
[12:28.540 --> 12:35.540]  of Lightning Start and 5 milliliters of Ruby per gallon to your solution. That is if you
[12:35.820 --> 12:41.100]  were using the New Millennium mix. If you're using the veg bloom base, it will be 5 grams
[12:41.100 --> 12:48.100]  of veg bloom powder, 1 milliliter of Lightning Start, and 5 milliliters of Ruby per gallon
[12:48.660 --> 12:55.660]  of water. Those are your two options for base mixes for week 1 of flower. Now these are
[12:57.060 --> 13:02.980]  the boosts which I would recommend adding through week 1. I would recommend that you
[13:02.980 --> 13:07.740]  add a little bit of CalMag at this time. I don't know which brand of CalMag you have
[13:07.740 --> 13:12.780]  purchased. I don't know which bottle you've got. If you were using the General Hydroponics
[13:12.780 --> 13:19.780]  Cali Magic, I recommend 1 to 2 milliliters per gallon of CalMag as a boost in this recipe.
[13:22.140 --> 13:29.140]  Then I also recommend 1 milliliter per gallon of Lightning Start as a boost in this recipe.
[13:29.700 --> 13:36.700]  I also recommend 1 half to 1 full gram of Plus Life per gallon of water as a boost in
[13:37.700 --> 13:42.700]  this recipe. So you will have your base mix that you will feed every day. Then if you
[13:42.700 --> 13:49.700]  are going to rotate your boosts, you will do CalMag at 1 to 2 mils per gallon, Lightning
[13:49.700 --> 13:56.700]  Start at 1 milliliter per gallon, and then Plus Life at 1 half to 1 full gram per gallon,
[13:57.500 --> 14:00.100]  and that is the week 1 mix.
[14:00.100 --> 14:06.540]  Now let's move into week 2 of the flowering cycle. For our base mix, we have the Ruby
[14:07.100 --> 14:14.100]  option. We can use 5 grams of Veg Bloom dried nutrients, or you can use 5 milliliters of
[14:16.140 --> 14:23.140]  Equinox, 6 milliliters of Summer Shift, and 6 milliliters of Autumn Gold per gallon of
[14:25.300 --> 14:32.300]  water. So it's 5 milliliters of Equinox, 6 milliliters of Summer Shift, and 6 milliliters
[14:32.900 --> 14:39.460]  of Autumn Gold. To that, if you are using the Veg Bloom dried mix or that Veg Bloom
[14:39.460 --> 14:46.460]  liquid mix I just spoke of, we are going to add 1 milliliter per gallon of Appetite from
[14:46.860 --> 14:53.420]  New Millennium. We are also going to add 5 mils of Ruby. Basically what we have done,
[14:53.420 --> 14:58.660]  we have increased the Equinox by 1 milliliter to add a little more energy to the plants,
[14:58.660 --> 15:03.580]  and we have swapped out the Lightning Start for the Appetite because I think we have got
[15:03.580 --> 15:07.860]  enough roots at this time. We are going to focus more on the PK.
[15:07.860 --> 15:13.180]  So that is our base mix. If you are using the 5 grams of Veg Bloom mix or the New Millennium
[15:13.180 --> 15:20.180]  liquid mix, make sure to add that 1 mil of Appetite and 5 milliliters of Ruby. Our boosts
[15:20.260 --> 15:27.260]  for week 2 are going to be 1 to 2 mils of Cow Mag, 1 milliliter of Lightning Start,
[15:28.140 --> 15:35.140]  and 1 half to 1 full gram of Plus Life per gallon of water. So weeks 1 and 2 are very
[15:35.980 --> 15:41.620]  similar. The main difference is that we have now introduced the Appetite PK to start increasing
[15:41.620 --> 15:45.380]  phosphorus and potassium to give us fatter buds.
[15:45.380 --> 15:51.940]  Now let's move into week 3. Week 3 is when we are going to add a product called Shine.
[15:51.940 --> 15:56.540]  Shine is part of the Veg Bloom lineup. I think that adding Shine early in flower will help
[15:56.540 --> 16:01.500]  reduce stretch so that our plants don't get so stretchy for the first three weeks. I also
[16:01.500 --> 16:07.620]  think it helps start speeding up bud development, and I know it absolutely helps start developing
[16:07.620 --> 16:11.900]  trichomes early. So let's add a little bit of Shine to the mix. We'll get more specific
[16:11.900 --> 16:13.340]  on that in a moment.
[16:13.340 --> 16:20.340]  Let's focus on the base mix for week 3. Of course, you can use the Veg Bloom powdered
[16:20.380 --> 16:27.380]  nutrients at 5 grams per gallon, or you can use the new Millennium Base Mix for week 3.
[16:28.140 --> 16:35.140]  That is going to be 5 milliliters of Equinox, 5 milliliters of Summer Shift, and we've increased
[16:35.740 --> 16:42.740]  to 10 milliliters of Autumn Gold per gallon of water. So that is our main base mix. You
[16:43.420 --> 16:50.180]  can either use the 5 grams of dried nutrients or 5 milliliters of Equinox, 5 milliliters
[16:50.180 --> 16:56.620]  of Summer Shift, and 10 milliliters of Autumn Gold. But again, please do not mix the 5 grams
[16:56.620 --> 17:01.460]  and that solution together. That will fry the shit out of your crop.
[17:01.460 --> 17:05.660]  Now whichever base mix you have chosen to work with, to that we are going to add the
[17:05.660 --> 17:12.440]  1 milliliter per gallon of Appetite, and we are also going to add 5 milliliters per gallon
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.920]  of Ruby. Basically, every time we mix up a nutrient solution in this facility, we are
[17:17.920 --> 17:24.360]  going to add 5 milliliters per gallon of water of Ruby every time.
[17:24.360 --> 17:29.760]  So we've got our base mix, we've got our 5 milliliters of Equinox, 5 milliliters of Summer
[17:29.760 --> 17:36.760]  Shift, 10 milliliters of Autumn Gold, or 5 grams of Veg Bloom powdered nutrients. To
[17:36.800 --> 17:42.280]  that, we have mixed in our 1 milliliter of Appetite, we've added 5 mils of Ruby. Then
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.880]  our boosts for week three are going to be CalMag. Once again, we will do CalMag at 1
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.200]  to 2 milliliters per gallon. I'm not sure which brand you have purchased. Adjust accordingly.
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.760]  You guys pay attention to what the bottle says. Read the back of the bottle. Maybe use
[17:58.760 --> 18:03.400]  half of the recommended dosage and pay attention to the plants. And if you see a CalMag deficiency
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.760]  coming on, don't try to boost it up really hard. Increase it slowly and the plants will
[18:08.760 --> 18:14.880]  appreciate you. So our boosts are CalMag. We're also going to use 1 milliliter of Lightning
[18:14.880 --> 18:21.360]  Start. We're also going to use 1 half to 1 gram of Plus Life per gallon of water. And
[18:21.360 --> 18:29.720]  this week, we are going to add Shine. Let's add 1 gram of Shine per gallon of water.
[18:29.720 --> 18:36.880]  So our boosts for week three are CalMag, Lightning Start, Plus Life, and Shine. Now
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.200]  by the end of week three, we should start seeing nice bud sets, little bud developments.
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.880]  Those little dandelions are popping up. It is starting to get exciting. Now it is time
[18:45.880 --> 18:52.560]  to increase the Appetite and increase the Shine to start building up those big fat buds.
[18:52.560 --> 19:00.680]  Let's focus on the week four base mix. For week four, you do have the option of 5 grams
[19:00.680 --> 19:08.720]  per gallon of Veg Bloom base nutrients. Or if you are using New Millennium liquid nutrients,
[19:08.720 --> 19:16.720]  you can use 5 milliliters per gallon of water of Equinox, 5 milliliters per gallon of Summer
[19:16.720 --> 19:24.600]  Shift, and 10 milliliters per gallon of Autumn Gold. So for week four, our base is either
[19:24.600 --> 19:32.280]  5 grams of dried nutrients or 5 mils of Equinox, 5 mils of Summer Shift, and 10 mils of Autumn
[19:32.280 --> 19:38.720]  Gold. To either one of those mixes, we are going to add 2 milliliters of Appetite and
[19:38.720 --> 19:44.920]  5 milliliters of Ruby. Don't forget that every time we mix up a nutrient solution, we are
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.380]  going to add 5 mils of Ruby to make it worth our time. That Ruby works like an octane booster
[19:51.380 --> 19:55.720]  or a turbocharger for our nutrients. Let's be sure to add that.
[19:55.720 --> 20:02.540]  Now for our boosts for week four, we are going to add 1 to 2 milliliters of CalMag. We are
[20:02.540 --> 20:08.380]  also going to use 1 half to 1 full gram of Plus Life. Now this week, we are going to
[20:08.380 --> 20:15.700]  increase to 2 grams of Shine per gallon of water. Now we are working our way into week
[20:15.700 --> 20:21.620]  five. We are starting to see nice bud development. Now we are going to take the Summer Shift
[20:21.620 --> 20:26.100]  out of the mix. We aren't using Summer Shift anymore. Our mixes are going to change a little
[20:26.100 --> 20:32.580]  bit. Let's talk about the week five flowering feed mix. On week five, of course, you can
[20:32.580 --> 20:42.460]  use 5 grams of dried Vegebloom powdered nutrients as your base mix, or you can use 4 milliliters
[20:42.460 --> 20:50.100]  of Equinox and 16 milliliters of Autumn Gold per gallon as your base mix. So your options
[20:50.100 --> 20:58.500]  are 5 grams of Vegebloom dried powdered nutrients or 4 milliliters of Equinox and 16 milliliters
[20:58.540 --> 21:04.420]  of Autumn Gold per gallon of water, but do not double up. Again, I know I keep repeating
[21:04.420 --> 21:10.060]  this, but do not use both base mixes because you will cook your plants. I'm giving you
[21:10.060 --> 21:15.020]  two options because some people want to use Vegebloom and some people want to use New
[21:15.020 --> 21:19.940]  Millennium. I find that they work beautifully when you combine the two. So I like to use
[21:19.940 --> 21:25.860]  the powdered base nutrients and then add in the boosters and the add-ins from New Millennium.
[21:25.860 --> 21:32.380]  So let's refocus. Our options are 5 grams of dried nutrients or 4 mils of Equinox and
[21:32.380 --> 21:38.540]  16 milliliters of Autumn Gold. Those are your options. Don't mix the dried and the wet nutrients
[21:38.540 --> 21:44.580]  at the same time. To that, whichever base you have chosen, we are going to add 2 milliliters
[21:44.580 --> 21:51.700]  of Appetite and 5 milliliters of Ruby per gallon of water. That is our base setup for
[21:51.700 --> 22:00.700]  week 5. Our boosts for week 5 will be 1 to 2 milliliters of CalMag, 1 half to 1 gram
[22:00.700 --> 22:09.380]  of Plus Life, and 2 grams of Shine per gallon of water. Now let's move into week 6. Week
[22:09.380 --> 22:17.380]  6 is going to be very similar. We have got the 5 grams of Vegebloom dried base nutrients
[22:17.380 --> 22:25.140]  or 4 milliliters of Equinox and 16 milliliters of Autumn Gold. This week, we are going to
[22:25.140 --> 22:30.100]  increase the Appetite because our buds are getting bigger. We want a little more PK,
[22:30.100 --> 22:33.920]  a little more energy, a little more beef, a little more chunk in there. So we have now
[22:33.920 --> 22:39.980]  got 3 milliliters of Appetite per gallon of water. And as always, we are going to add
[22:39.980 --> 22:49.500]  the 5 milliliters of Ruby. Now our boosts for week 6 are going to be 1 to 2 milliliters
[22:49.500 --> 22:58.780]  of CalMag, 1 half to 1 full gram of Plus Life. And again, we are adding in 2 full grams of
[22:58.780 --> 23:04.420]  Shine per gallon. Now if you are going to have nutrient deficiencies, if you're going
[23:04.420 --> 23:09.460]  to run into a nitrogen deficiency, if you're going to have a CalMag deficiency, now is
[23:09.460 --> 23:14.580]  really when it is going to start standing out. Be prepared for nutrient deficiencies
[23:14.580 --> 23:19.300]  at this point in time. You may have to adjust things. I don't know what's happening in your
[23:19.300 --> 23:25.000]  grow. I cannot see your leaves. I don't know what to adjust. But now is the time when you
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.140]  really need to pay close attention to the plants. We are getting to the home stretch.
[23:29.140 --> 23:34.340]  The plants are at high performance mode. This is when it is very likely that you will notice
[23:34.340 --> 23:40.620]  the early onset of nutrient deficiencies. So pay attention. Make sure your pH is properly
[23:40.620 --> 23:44.740]  dialed in before you water the plants. Make sure you are taking the runoff reports I've
[23:44.740 --> 23:50.060]  spoken of in previous episodes. We are getting really close to harvest time, but we are also
[23:50.060 --> 23:55.400]  getting to the critical time where the plants will begin to show and express problems. So
[23:55.400 --> 23:59.980]  be on the lookout every day. Be in the grow as often as you can, looking at leaves up
[23:59.980 --> 24:04.820]  top, looking at leaves down low. Pay attention to your grow because now we are putting these
[24:04.820 --> 24:10.020]  plants in high performance mode and the heat is on. We are halfway through the grow and
[24:10.020 --> 24:14.800]  we can either make it amazing or we can ruin it at this point. So be prepared and stay
[24:14.800 --> 24:19.140]  on top of your game. Don't get lazy because you've gotten this far in. You've got to keep
[24:19.140 --> 24:20.140]  crushing it.
[24:20.140 --> 24:25.380]  Now let's keep me focused and work our way into week seven of the flowering phase. In
[24:25.380 --> 24:32.180]  week seven, you can use the five grams of Veg Bloom powdered base nutrient mix, or you
[24:32.180 --> 24:41.460]  can use four milliliters of Equinox and 16 milliliters of Autumn Gold per gallon of water.
[24:41.460 --> 24:47.180]  Again, don't mix the five grams with the four and the 16. Do one or the other, please. I
[24:47.180 --> 24:51.700]  hope I can quit saying that by the time we get to week nine. All right. On top of that
[24:51.700 --> 24:58.860]  base mix, we're going to add four milliliters per gallon of Appetite and five milliliters
[24:58.860 --> 25:06.260]  per gallon of Ruby. Our boosts for week seven are going to be one to two milliliters of
[25:06.260 --> 25:14.900]  Cow Mag, one half to one full gram of Plus Life and two grams of Shine. Now, if you are
[25:14.900 --> 25:19.300]  an experienced grower and you know what to watch for and you're not adding anything else,
[25:19.300 --> 25:26.180]  you may be able to increase the amount of Shine you add at this time. I would increase
[25:26.180 --> 25:31.500]  slowly, maybe a half a gram at a time. Don't go more than one gram, but you may be able
[25:31.500 --> 25:36.740]  to get two and a half to three grams of Shine into the plants at this time without causing
[25:36.740 --> 25:42.220]  any issues. That depends on how much light you've got, what kind of plants you're growing,
[25:42.220 --> 25:46.500]  what strains you've got, how they take nutrients, and the rest of the environment in the room
[25:46.500 --> 25:53.340]  will also be a factor, but you may be able to increase the Shine at this time. Now it
[25:53.340 --> 25:59.660]  is time to move into week eight. In my grow schedule, I plan on growing these plants for
[25:59.660 --> 26:06.180]  nine weeks. Sometimes I'm able to go for nine and a half weeks, but most of the time I try
[26:06.180 --> 26:12.620]  to stick to a 63 day flowering schedule. If I press it too far one way or the other, I
[26:12.620 --> 26:17.540]  grow the other rooms off, which throws the entire facility off, which throws production
[26:17.540 --> 26:21.860]  off and that ripples throughout the grow. We don't get back on schedule for several
[26:21.860 --> 26:27.300]  months when I do bullshit moves like that. So I try very carefully to keep my rooms on
[26:27.300 --> 26:34.020]  a 63 day flowering schedule. That means at week eight, we need to consider flushing.
[26:34.020 --> 26:42.340]  I want to get at least 10 days, maybe 14 days of flushing out of these plants. In this scenario,
[26:42.340 --> 26:48.620]  we are going to feed these plants for the first four days of week eight. Then we are
[26:48.620 --> 26:54.500]  going to transition to a flush phase. We are growing in cocoa, so nutrients are not hanging
[26:54.500 --> 26:59.580]  around. We are also watering the plants twice a day, which means this cocoa is going to
[26:59.580 --> 27:06.260]  get rinsed out approximately 20 times before we go to harvest. We are going to have plenty
[27:06.260 --> 27:12.380]  of flush time and plenty of flush activity on these three gallon pots for 10 days before
[27:12.380 --> 27:18.980]  we harvest. So before we get there, let's focus on the four days of week eight, which
[27:18.980 --> 27:24.560]  we are going to feed these plants. There's no need to add nitrogen for the last four
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.620]  days of our feeding regimen because we are going to work on pushing that out of the plants.
[27:29.620 --> 27:35.520]  Right now, we want to focus on fat, chunky bud development and trichome development.
[27:35.520 --> 27:42.140]  So we are going to ditch most of the nutrients. We are going to focus on five milliliters
[27:42.140 --> 27:50.520]  of ruby per gallon. We are also going to use 10 milliliters of winter frost per gallon.
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.960]  Winter frost is from new millennium. It is time to bust out that winter frost and add
[27:54.960 --> 28:02.600]  that to the mix. Our boosts for week eight are going to be one half to one gram of plus
[28:02.600 --> 28:09.600]  life and four milliliters per gallon of appetite. So every day we are going to get the five
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.920]  milliliters of ruby and 10 milliliters of winter frost. Then we are going to do a day
[28:14.920 --> 28:21.040]  of plus life, a day of appetite, a day of plus life and a day of appetite. Then we are
[28:21.040 --> 28:28.080]  going to begin flushing on the fifth day of week eight. That will give us day five, six
[28:28.080 --> 28:33.160]  and seven of week eight for flush. We get all of week nine for flush. That will give
[28:33.160 --> 28:38.320]  us a beautiful flush. Our buds will taste delicious. They will burn nice and clean.
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.200]  We will have a wonderful product if we dry and cure it properly, but that's a whole other
[28:43.200 --> 28:44.200]  episode.
[28:44.200 --> 28:50.720]  Let's talk about this flush phase. In most cases, I don't recommend adding any products
[28:50.720 --> 28:56.320]  during flush. There is no reason to add anything at this time. We're trying to rinse out that
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.000]  cocoa to where there are no nutrients in there. That makes the plants starve themselves.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.200]  Then they begin to cannibalize themselves. They eat up all the leftover sugars and nutrients.
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.760]  That way our buds taste good and our bowls burn smoothly. So let's work on a flush. All
[29:10.760 --> 29:17.080]  we have to do is water the plants as needed. Water them in the morning, get that 20% runoff.
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.800]  Water them again before you leave, get that 20% runoff. Then at the end of week nine,
[29:21.800 --> 29:26.200]  when you harvest, those plants should taste delicious and they should burn beautifully
[29:26.200 --> 29:32.400]  without weird ashes and weird aromas. Again, that does depend on a proper dry and cure.
[29:32.400 --> 29:39.000]  Now if you did experience any nutrient burn, any problems during the flowering phase, when
[29:39.000 --> 29:46.800]  you are flushing, you can use a product called SLF-100. It is an enzyme. It will help clean
[29:46.800 --> 29:52.080]  your cocoa. It will help clean out the rhizosphere during the flush phase, and it will help give
[29:52.080 --> 29:57.880]  you a cleaner product, and it will help speed up the flush phase. I generally don't recommend
[29:57.880 --> 30:03.040]  a flushing agent or a flush product. I find that to be unnecessary in cocoa. If you're
[30:03.040 --> 30:09.760]  going to do something like that, I would use SLF-100 as an enzyme. But in most situations,
[30:09.760 --> 30:14.680]  there is no need to add anything during the flush phase. Just run plenty of water through
[30:14.680 --> 30:19.320]  those plants. Don't drown them at the end. Just flush them. We want to rinse out the
[30:19.320 --> 30:20.640]  cocoa.
[30:20.640 --> 30:25.880]  For the last few days of flush, I don't even adjust the pH because I'm not worried about
[30:25.880 --> 30:31.920]  the pH of the solution because I don't need the plants able to absorb nutrients anyway.
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.600]  Adjusting the pH is all about making nutrients available. I'm not worried about that. For
[30:36.600 --> 30:41.020]  the last couple of days, I'm basically just watering the plants to keep them alive until
[30:41.020 --> 30:42.980]  I choose to give them the chop.
[30:42.980 --> 30:49.740]  All right. That is the basic recipe for my New Millennium and Veg Bloom nutrient mix.
[30:49.740 --> 30:53.900]  I did mention that there were some things I would add and things that more experienced
[30:53.900 --> 30:59.420]  growers can add if your budget allows it, if your skill level makes you comfortable.
[30:59.420 --> 31:03.760]  Let's talk about a few more things you can add to this mix.
[31:03.760 --> 31:11.200]  I really like a product called Decision. I like to use Decision at day one of flower.
[31:11.200 --> 31:17.560]  Add it to your nutrient mix at a rate of 15 milliliters per gallon, and you will see that
[31:17.560 --> 31:23.680]  your plants begin to flower sooner than they would have if you did not use Decision. So
[31:23.680 --> 31:29.840]  I recommend Decision on day one of the flowering phase.
[31:29.920 --> 31:35.640]  I would also recommend a product called Carbonaria. That is basically carbs to give the plants
[31:35.640 --> 31:43.320]  energy. I like to add Carbonaria at a rate of five milliliters per gallon in mid to late
[31:43.320 --> 31:50.680]  flower. I would start this probably around week four or week five. Be careful with the
[31:50.680 --> 31:57.560]  Carbonaria because it is sticky and goopy. If you are using some sort of an auto watering
[31:57.560 --> 32:05.240]  system, you will need to use your filters. Also, stir it up very well and put the carb
[32:05.240 --> 32:10.400]  in there. Stir the shit out of it, then add the shine and plus life. If you add them together
[32:10.400 --> 32:13.900]  without stirring, you're going to make a big ball of funkiness.
[32:13.900 --> 32:19.960]  So if you do use the Carbonaria, make sure you stir the shit out of it. I recommend using
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.840]  a filter if you're using an auto watering system. You folks that build the irrigation
[32:24.840 --> 32:30.400]  systems, you know what I mean by adding a filter or a pre-filter. I also will recommend
[32:30.400 --> 32:36.800]  a product called Budswell. Budswell is a bloom booster that is mainly guano based. It is
[32:36.800 --> 32:43.400]  liquid. I recommend Budswell at a rate of two milliliters per gallon.
[32:43.400 --> 32:48.520]  And let me back up before we get carried away. The Carbonaria and Budswell would be used
[32:48.520 --> 32:53.200]  as a booster. Just add those to your down the daily sheet, like your Monday, Tuesday,
[32:53.200 --> 32:56.600]  Wednesday, maybe Wednesday, you're going to add Carbonaria. Maybe Thursday, you're
[32:56.600 --> 33:02.000]  going to add Budswell now. Just add one more booster to the list and keep that in the rotation.
[33:02.000 --> 33:07.840]  The decision you will only use once, and that is the first day of flower. If you're mixing
[33:07.840 --> 33:12.000]  up your nutrients for the full week, you will be okay feeding that through the entire first
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.400]  week. That will just trigger your plants to go into flower that much more quickly.
[33:16.400 --> 33:20.840]  Let's get back to the Budswell. I think I said two milliliters per gallon, and I would
[33:20.840 --> 33:27.120]  start that at mid to late flower, sometime around week five or week six. If it fits the
[33:27.120 --> 33:32.640]  budget, add it early. If you need to save a few bucks, wait until week six.
[33:32.640 --> 33:40.000]  Another product I like is Silicium. Silicium is silicates. I recommend two to four milliliters
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.240]  per gallon of water. And I recommend you can use Silicium from the time you go to large
[33:46.240 --> 33:51.960]  veg all the way up to the time you begin to flush. I think that Silicium adds a little
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.240]  bit of strength to the plants, and they recover a little more when we do pop and crack and
[33:56.240 --> 34:03.840]  twist them. So Silicium at two to four milliliters per gallon from large veg all the way up to
[34:03.840 --> 34:09.020]  flush. That product is a little pricey. That's why I say it's an add-on if it is something
[34:09.020 --> 34:13.160]  you want to add, if it's something that fits the budget, and if you feel it's necessary
[34:13.160 --> 34:15.040]  for your grow.
[34:15.040 --> 34:22.920]  Another product that I will recommend is SLF-100 at five milliliters per gallon. SLF-100 is
[34:22.920 --> 34:29.020]  enzymes. I would recommend using that toward the end of flower and during the flush phase.
[34:29.020 --> 34:36.080]  If it fits your budget, maybe consider using SLF-100 once per week once you go into flower.
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.320]  And again, you guys, these last few items are not necessary. These are just things for
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.440]  when you feel comfortable with the original mix. If you want to step up your game a little
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.320]  bit more, if you feel like you can identify a problem and correct and adjust to problems
[34:51.320 --> 34:56.960]  on the fly, then you can step up your game a little bit and add a few of these products.
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.460]  When your skill level and your budget are ready, that's when you can add these things.
[35:01.460 --> 35:05.160]  And I recommend you add them maybe one at a time. Maybe have a harvest and buy another
[35:05.160 --> 35:08.960]  bottle and then have another harvest and buy another bottle. You don't have to buy everything
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.120]  all at once. Slowly increase your game, step up your skill level, step up the amount of
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.900]  products you're using. And I think your garden will appreciate you taking your time and building
[35:18.900 --> 35:19.900]  up slowly.
[35:19.900 --> 35:24.800]  Now, I've got one or two more things I'm going to recommend. Another product I really like
[35:24.800 --> 35:31.160]  is Liquid Karma from Botanicare. I use a lot of Liquid Karma. I think when I use Liquid
[35:31.160 --> 35:37.840]  Karma in mid to late flower, it adds a little bit of funky aroma to my grow. It makes my
[35:37.840 --> 35:43.520]  cushy stuff a little bit cushier. It makes my sweet stuff a little bit sweeter. I really
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.840]  believe that that comes from the kelp. So I would recommend Liquid Karma or a similar
[35:48.840 --> 35:55.000]  kelp-based product for mid to late flower. If you go with Liquid Karma, I will recommend
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.040]  three to five milliliters of Liquid Karma per gallon. Again, that would be added as
[36:01.040 --> 36:03.440]  a boost in the rotation.
[36:03.440 --> 36:09.160]  Now the last thing I'm going to recommend is a product from the Veg Bloom lineup called
[36:09.160 --> 36:16.800]  Push. I like to apply Push as a foliar feed once per week by itself. I also add Push to
[36:16.800 --> 36:24.000]  my integrated pest management program. Anytime I apply a sprayed on pesticide, I add the
[36:24.000 --> 36:31.160]  recommended dosage of Push to that pesticide. So if the budget allows it, I highly recommend
[36:31.160 --> 36:37.960]  a once a week foliar feeding of a product called Push. I like to apply Push from the
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.920]  time I go into those four or six inch net pots, and I will apply Push all the way up
[36:42.920 --> 36:48.760]  until week four or five of flower, just depending on how big and chunky the buds have gotten.
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.920]  Once the buds are spongy and they're able to kind of suck up some of that moisture,
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.480]  I will not apply a foliar feed, but I will spray right up until they get a little bit
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.080]  chunky with that Push. Just be very careful and don't spray big buds, and don't let that
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.920]  moisture hang around for too long. Don't let that air get stagnant in your room. That will
[37:07.920 --> 37:10.400]  give you opportunities for problems.
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, clone
[37:14.840 --> 37:20.520]  cutters and pollen chuckers, I think that wraps up my nutrient mix episode. I want to
