[02:17.710 --> 02:19.390]  you may need.
[02:19.390 --> 02:23.550]  I also want to take a quick minute to thank everybody who has supported Irie Direct.
[02:23.550 --> 02:28.670]  If you check out my website iriegenetics.com there is a tab that says Irie Direct.
[02:28.670 --> 02:31.630]  Big thank you to everybody who has supported Irie Direct.
[02:31.630 --> 02:34.870]  If you have not gotten your tracking number yet please do send me an email.
[02:34.870 --> 02:38.990]  I will get that tracking number out to you as soon as possible.
[02:38.990 --> 02:43.350]  Alright, I did start off the show by talking about listener emails that I was going to
[02:43.350 --> 02:44.350]  read.
[02:44.350 --> 02:46.550]  Let's jump right into that portion of the show.
[02:46.550 --> 02:50.950]  This one comes from our friend Chase and it goes a little bit like this.
[02:50.950 --> 02:56.150]  It says, yo, what if you have a pack of fem seeds but you really want to breed or make
[02:56.150 --> 02:57.150]  seeds?
[02:57.150 --> 03:02.870]  Can you just use STS on a female plant and get normal seeds or will they always be feminized?
[03:02.870 --> 03:04.950]  That is a very good question.
[03:04.950 --> 03:10.790]  If you only have fem seeds there is not a way to make a male plant unless you do something
[03:10.790 --> 03:13.990]  to one of those female plants to make it create pollen.
[03:13.990 --> 03:18.790]  So without introducing a male plant to that mix, without having some male pollen, there
[03:18.790 --> 03:20.950]  is no way to make regular seeds.
[03:20.950 --> 03:25.230]  Your seeds will always be female unless you do introduce a male.
[03:25.230 --> 03:30.030]  If you do put a male plant into the mix and you pollinate a female, a feminized female
[03:30.030 --> 03:34.470]  plant with a regular male plant, the seeds that come from that will be male and female.
[03:34.470 --> 03:36.070]  It's all about that pollen donor.
[03:36.070 --> 03:40.630]  So your original question is, if you've only got fems and you want to make seeds, can you
[03:40.630 --> 03:44.390]  make a female plant, get normal seeds or will they always be femmed?
[03:44.390 --> 03:45.570]  These will always be fems.
[03:45.570 --> 03:49.710]  If you only have fems to work with, you're only going to make more fems.
[03:49.710 --> 03:53.510]  There is nothing wrong with breeding from feminized seeds but I would recommend doing
[03:53.510 --> 03:58.110]  some sort of outcrossing, not just taking it further filial generations.
[03:58.190 --> 04:01.910]  I would add some more plants to the mix but this is your project.
[04:01.910 --> 04:02.910]  You do what you want.
[04:02.910 --> 04:03.910]  Breed with love.
[04:03.910 --> 04:04.910]  Grow from your heart.
[04:04.910 --> 04:05.910]  Most importantly, have a good time.
[04:05.910 --> 04:07.590]  I hope I answered your question.
[04:07.590 --> 04:11.750]  The real quick answer, they're always going to be females and then I do encourage you
[04:11.750 --> 04:12.990]  to do your breeding project.
[04:12.990 --> 04:16.990]  All right, big shout out to my buddy Chase for the great question.
[04:16.990 --> 04:17.990]  Let's keep it moving.
[04:17.990 --> 04:19.210]  I've got another question here.
[04:19.210 --> 04:25.310]  This one says, hey man, can I use rainwater instead of distilled water?
[04:25.310 --> 04:28.710]  The quick answer is going to be you could, you can.
[04:28.710 --> 04:30.830]  I would at least do a basic water test.
[04:30.830 --> 04:32.850]  Maybe find out what's in that water.
[04:32.850 --> 04:36.550]  Maybe at least check the EC and the TDS of that water.
[04:36.550 --> 04:40.430]  Definitely check the pH but maybe do a quick test and find out what's in there.
[04:40.430 --> 04:42.310]  It kind of depends on what's in your area.
[04:42.310 --> 04:47.390]  I live near a steel mill that puts off a lot of disgusting chemicals.
[04:47.390 --> 04:52.670]  The rain in my area will probably have steel mill chemicals in it which will end up in
[04:52.670 --> 04:57.350]  my plants which is probably going to be some form of heavy metals or some sort of junk
[04:57.350 --> 04:58.590]  I don't want in my plants.
[04:58.590 --> 05:03.150]  Honestly, I don't know enough about water science and what can travel through the water
[05:03.150 --> 05:07.230]  and through the air that way to have a solid testimony but I wouldn't recommend it if you
[05:07.230 --> 05:13.230]  live in the city or near chemical plants or a lot of factories and shit.
[05:13.230 --> 05:16.470]  If you're out in the trees and out in the woods where the water tastes good, then I
[05:16.470 --> 05:17.710]  would definitely recommend it.
[05:17.710 --> 05:22.270]  Then I would use that water but before I use any water that doesn't come from a regulated
[05:22.590 --> 05:28.030]  municipal system and municipal source, I would check on it, see what's in that water.
[05:28.030 --> 05:30.830]  If you don't have a way to test it, if you can't scoop up some water and take it to a
[05:30.830 --> 05:35.030]  water testing place or at least do a little bit of testing on your own, maybe at least
[05:35.030 --> 05:39.470]  just feed it to a couple of plants before you give it to the entire garden and see what
[05:39.470 --> 05:40.470]  a few plants do.
[05:40.470 --> 05:45.070]  That is my version of testing if you are isolated, don't have a lot of resources.
[05:45.070 --> 05:49.350]  The short answer is yes, you can use rainwater but think about what are you collecting the
[05:49.350 --> 05:50.350]  water in?
[05:50.350 --> 05:51.350]  How are you collecting it?
[05:51.430 --> 05:53.910]  Is that water running over as you collect it?
[05:53.910 --> 05:57.950]  Is it running off of your roof of your house, onto your car, then into a bucket?
[05:57.950 --> 06:01.750]  Are you actually collecting it in some sort of a semi-clean manner where you're not gathering
[06:01.750 --> 06:02.750]  a bunch of shit?
[06:02.750 --> 06:05.350]  Whatever it washes over is going to end up into your collection vessel.
[06:05.350 --> 06:08.150]  I'm not trying to discourage you but I want it to be clean.
[06:08.150 --> 06:11.630]  Something that caught my attention, you said you're using distilled water.
[06:11.630 --> 06:12.630]  Why?
[06:12.630 --> 06:14.030]  What are you using distilled water for?
[06:14.030 --> 06:16.350]  Why are you doing that?
[06:16.350 --> 06:17.350]  Nobody else does that.
[06:17.350 --> 06:20.110]  I'm not sure why you're using distilled water.
[06:20.110 --> 06:24.990]  Maybe it's filtered water, maybe RO water, maybe water that went through a big boy.
[06:24.990 --> 06:28.030]  Most of the time, my water here in Colorado is pretty cool.
[06:28.030 --> 06:29.510]  I just run for the home grow.
[06:29.510 --> 06:30.510]  I don't even use a filter.
[06:30.510 --> 06:32.910]  For the commercial grow, I just use a big boy.
[06:32.910 --> 06:35.510]  I'm not sure why you're using distilled water.
[06:35.510 --> 06:38.950]  That may not be the best idea but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[06:38.950 --> 06:39.950]  All right, thank you for the great question.
[06:39.950 --> 06:41.550]  That one came from our friend Joseph.
[06:41.550 --> 06:43.750]  I told you I had a few messages here in front of me.
[06:43.750 --> 06:45.630]  We're just going to keep cooking right through them.
[06:46.010 --> 06:51.750]  They have a question that says, should I worry if my buds have started throwing nanners at
[06:51.750 --> 06:53.590]  week six of flower?
[06:53.590 --> 06:55.550]  Then it says in light depth.
[06:55.550 --> 07:00.870]  Yes, I would be concerned if my plants started showing nanners at week six of flower.
[07:00.870 --> 07:05.750]  That is a sign of intersex or hermaphroditism, which is not desirable when it comes to a
[07:05.750 --> 07:06.990]  cannabis plant.
[07:06.990 --> 07:08.870]  We don't want that trait.
[07:08.870 --> 07:13.550]  Those nanners, if they're viable, they can have pollen in them.
[07:13.550 --> 07:17.350]  open up and it will pollinate at least the buds right next to them possibly the
[07:17.350 --> 07:21.350]  entire crop and having nanners at week six is not a good thing I would
[07:21.350 --> 07:24.870]  definitely kind of freak out a little bit since you say it's a light depth
[07:24.870 --> 07:29.950]  garden I'm going to assume that there is a little bit of a light leak somewhere
[07:29.950 --> 07:34.090]  probably right where you're seeing those nanners light is probably getting in
[07:34.090 --> 07:37.910]  there when you think it is dark that would be my main assumption so I would
[07:37.910 --> 07:42.870]  assess the situation see if you've got total darkness if not correct that then
[07:42.870 --> 07:47.990]  I would work on what to do with these intersex plants you've got a couple of
[07:47.990 --> 07:51.230]  options are they throwing just a few nanners if it's just a few maybe you
[07:51.230 --> 07:54.550]  could cut them out if it's a lot I would really start freaking out if it's just a
[07:54.550 --> 07:58.470]  couple spray them with water and pluck them out with tweezers and then keep an
[07:58.470 --> 08:03.150]  eye on that plant if they reappear you got shit to think about if they don't
[08:03.150 --> 08:06.510]  come back you're okay if you've got a lot I would probably just cut them down
[08:06.510 --> 08:10.910]  you are past the point now where I don't think those plants are at risk of
[08:10.910 --> 08:15.150]  getting seeded but it still isn't going to make the crop any better to have a
[08:15.150 --> 08:19.470]  hermaphroditic plant inside of the the greenhouse the what is it a hoop house
[08:19.470 --> 08:24.350]  probably in the light depth situation so it is probably detrimental to that crop
[08:24.350 --> 08:27.430]  I would pay very close attention if you've got all clones of the same strain
[08:27.430 --> 08:30.390]  it's a very good likelihood it could happen across the room if you got
[08:30.390 --> 08:34.390]  different strains different plants will have different resistances also again I
[08:34.390 --> 08:39.310]  would check wherever that plant is I bet you it's on an outer edge at a corner or
[08:39.310 --> 08:42.710]  something where the tarp isn't covering perfectly at night maybe the wind is
[08:42.710 --> 08:46.830]  blowing it's still daytime outside but it's nighttime in your grow environment
[08:46.830 --> 08:50.310]  the wind is blowing there's a crack in the tarp something like that the lights
[08:50.310 --> 08:53.350]  coming in right there that is probably right where the culprit with the
[08:53.350 --> 08:57.790]  intersex plant will be found so yes you should worry if your buds have started
[08:57.790 --> 09:02.250]  throwing nanners at week six of flower that is called an intersex plant that is
[09:02.250 --> 09:05.470]  a breeders nightmare that's also a growers nightmare I hope you've ran this
[09:05.470 --> 09:09.270]  plant in a smaller environment to figure out if it's a good plant before you
[09:09.270 --> 09:13.270]  put it out in the light depth either way sounds like you've got some problems
[09:13.270 --> 09:17.550]  time to start thinking about what to do all right this next question is sort of
[09:17.550 --> 09:21.350]  a change of pace this one is a little bit different and it goes a little bit
[09:21.350 --> 09:25.830]  like this it says I have sent someone who is very popular in the cannabis
[09:25.830 --> 09:31.350]  field 500 phenol hunted seeds he was supposed to work with and his girls too
[09:31.350 --> 09:35.870]  oh and add his girls too so our friend sent 500 I'm not sure what you mean by
[09:35.870 --> 09:38.950]  phenol hunted seeds you can't really phenol hunt they haven't been phenol
[09:38.950 --> 09:42.310]  hunted yet he's got to phenol hunt them maybe they were specially bred or
[09:42.310 --> 09:48.230]  specially selected seeds anyhow our listener sent 500 seeds to a very
[09:48.230 --> 09:52.270]  popular grower who was supposed to work with them and add his girls to the mix
[09:52.270 --> 09:57.070]  this popular breeder claims he lost all of the seeds that's kind of sketchy
[09:57.070 --> 10:01.310]  sounds sketchy to me it says my question is what's the best way to do a collab
[10:01.310 --> 10:05.190]  with someone without them fucking you over my other question well let's talk
[10:05.190 --> 10:09.110]  about that part first best way to do a collab without getting fucked over build
[10:09.110 --> 10:14.110]  a solid relationship work with people that you know meet people face to face
[10:14.110 --> 10:16.790]  it's great that we're making friends on the internet and they were so spread out
[10:16.790 --> 10:20.230]  and that like-minded people in one part of the country are meeting like-minded
[10:20.230 --> 10:23.350]  people in the other part of the country and we're doing shit together but if
[10:23.350 --> 10:27.070]  you're gonna send somebody 500 seeds and it bothers you enough that you're gonna
[10:27.070 --> 10:31.590]  send me an email about it maybe you need to meet these people face to face shake
[10:31.590 --> 10:34.950]  hands make an agreement do some things like that before you go into business
[10:34.950 --> 10:41.150]  like this my other line of thought is this is partly why sometimes I don't do
[10:41.150 --> 10:45.750]  business with some of my friends I started doing when I started my business
[10:45.750 --> 10:50.670]  my company I relied on friends for a lot of their services I like having my stuff
[10:50.670 --> 10:54.070]  made by my friends because then they get to make some money their business moves
[10:54.070 --> 10:58.390]  my business moves I see them get to buy groceries with the money that I gave
[10:58.390 --> 11:01.670]  them and then I my business moves there's moves it feels good but
[11:01.670 --> 11:05.030]  sometimes it's hard to do business with your friends because when your friends
[11:05.030 --> 11:09.430]  mess up like let's just say that random company messed up let's just say that
[11:09.430 --> 11:12.750]  cloud what who makes this this is called the cloud lifter let's say cloud fucked
[11:12.750 --> 11:16.470]  up I could call them and cuss them out cuz I don't know them it's just not a
[11:16.470 --> 11:19.230]  problem hey my thing fucked up I need a new one if they give me problems on the
[11:19.230 --> 11:23.150]  phone I go no listen it broke it as a warranty send me a fucking new one if I
[11:23.150 --> 11:26.870]  do business with my friends and shit goes wrong it's like no it's okay buddy
[11:26.870 --> 11:29.790]  I'll just eat the loss when deep down inside you're like fuck I needed to make
[11:29.790 --> 11:32.990]  that money and now both our businesses are not gonna work and I got weird
[11:32.990 --> 11:36.630]  fucking animosity toward you and you think you're getting one over on me and
[11:36.630 --> 11:38.590]  I don't like that you're getting one over on me and this is gonna last
[11:38.590 --> 11:43.650]  forever ah that shit sort of sucks so a lot of the times I choose to not even do
[11:43.650 --> 11:46.550]  business with my friends at this point if there's somebody else out there that
[11:46.550 --> 11:50.710]  can do the job I may hit them up for it if you've recently done artwork for me
[11:50.710 --> 11:52.750]  or done some shit don't feel like I'm saying you're not my friend I'm saying
[11:52.750 --> 11:58.350]  in most cases but I do love feeding my friends and giving my friends work but
[11:58.350 --> 12:02.310]  oftentimes I'll just skip them and go somewhere else because it causes less
[12:02.310 --> 12:05.670]  headaches honestly but don't let that sway you don't let that stop you from
[12:05.670 --> 12:09.270]  doing business with your friends with your crew how I started saying this was
[12:09.270 --> 12:13.310]  build solid relationships with solid people spend time with people get to
[12:13.310 --> 12:17.110]  know them vet them see how they act go to dinner with somebody how do they
[12:17.110 --> 12:20.390]  treat the waitstaff are they cool to the waiter are they cool to the waitress are
[12:20.390 --> 12:23.870]  they respectful do they treat the waiter do they treat the waiter just like they
[12:23.870 --> 12:27.030]  treat you or do they treat the waiter like the waiters a piece of shit that
[12:27.030 --> 12:30.070]  stuff matters you'll learn a lot about those people so just go spend a few
[12:30.070 --> 12:34.830]  minutes spend some time with them before you jump into big 500 seed
[12:34.830 --> 12:39.350]  relationships and business proposals with this people so the best way to do a
[12:39.350 --> 12:43.190]  collab is to do it with somebody that you trust and you know and that there's
[12:43.190 --> 12:47.270]  a reason for you to be doing the collab I'm not just doing collabs with random
[12:47.270 --> 12:50.190]  people on the internet because there are plenty of other people that I know and
[12:50.190 --> 12:53.710]  trust and have a reputation that I am doing collabs with and it works better
[12:53.710 --> 12:57.590]  that way so the best way to do it is just build a reputation the other option
[12:57.590 --> 13:03.070]  is contracts you can write a contract contracts are very easily established
[13:03.070 --> 13:06.790]  written drawn up however you want to do it legal zoom.com will throw you out a
[13:06.790 --> 13:10.110]  very simple contract for a very good price they do not even pay me to
[13:10.110 --> 13:14.030]  advertise them legal zoom.com will get you out of so much hot water they'll
[13:14.030 --> 13:16.830]  save you so much headache check them out they'll help you out you can get a
[13:16.830 --> 13:20.470]  contract or maybe you've got a basic lawyer or maybe you could just find a
[13:20.470 --> 13:25.030]  basic contract online that will cover what you need done but have an agreement
[13:25.030 --> 13:30.430]  have it in writing have a paper trail my expectation is this you agreed to do
[13:30.430 --> 13:35.110]  this together we expect to do this the outcome will be this the proceeds and
[13:35.110 --> 13:39.190]  profits will be divided this way in the case that this goes wrong this is how we
[13:39.190 --> 13:43.510]  will deal with it have all that shit in paper in writing before you get to that
[13:43.510 --> 13:46.150]  point that's why when you go to the car dealership you got to sign your
[13:46.150 --> 13:51.110]  signature 7,000 times they're covering their ass every way that they can so
[13:51.110 --> 13:54.350]  that you two are entering a contract you're saying I'm gonna get this car
[13:54.350 --> 13:57.910]  they're gonna give you the car the bank is gonna help you out you don't get any
[13:57.910 --> 14:01.670]  extra shit other than what's on the car but you do have a warranty you've all
[14:01.670 --> 14:05.910]  got to sign all of that shit so that if anything comes up every nut and bolt on
[14:05.910 --> 14:09.430]  that car is covered you've got to do the same thing when it comes to making a
[14:09.430 --> 14:13.350]  contract with your friends with your partners when it comes to a 500 seed
[14:13.350 --> 14:16.870]  deal I would definitely have some sort of arrangement some sort of protection
[14:16.870 --> 14:21.870]  in place but first of all men meet these people go shake their hands be friends
[14:21.870 --> 14:25.070]  see if they're cool see how they interact with the community see how are
[14:25.070 --> 14:27.630]  they cool with their girlfriend are they cool with waitstaff are they cool with
[14:27.630 --> 14:31.470]  their grandma see who they're cool with see see how they act in traffic just see
[14:31.470 --> 14:34.950]  how they are you can learn a lot about people it says my other question is
[14:34.950 --> 14:39.030]  because he says he lost my seeds shouldn't he pay me for my time and
[14:39.030 --> 14:44.110]  effort he's now going to send me 100 seeds of his and his pollen but I feel
[14:44.110 --> 14:48.350]  I'm owed more for all of my time and effort a year of projects lost what do
[14:48.350 --> 14:52.870]  you think I think that if you would have had that contract with a stipulation of
[14:52.870 --> 14:56.790]  if you lose my seeds then I get to take your firstborn child and I get to smash
[14:56.790 --> 14:59.870]  your car with a hammer you probably wouldn't have lost the seeds you might
[14:59.870 --> 15:03.630]  not assign the contract also get your contract to notarize but that's a whole
[15:03.630 --> 15:07.430]  another can of worms he probably would not have gone into business with you if
[15:07.470 --> 15:11.910]  you would have been more strict more of a stickler people that have contracts
[15:11.910 --> 15:15.710]  and cover their asses don't get taken advantage of so the other part of this
[15:15.710 --> 15:20.630]  was he should pay you for your time and effort but who determines what your time
[15:20.630 --> 15:24.510]  and effort is worth is that you or is that him you probably both totally
[15:24.510 --> 15:28.230]  disagree on what your time and effort is worth you probably totally disagree on
[15:28.230 --> 15:32.910]  what your seeds and pollen are worth you feel you're owed more it was a year of
[15:32.910 --> 15:37.390]  projects lost what do you feel a year worth of breeding projects was worth not
[15:37.390 --> 15:40.470]  only the year worth of the seeds but the year it set you back the year you
[15:40.470 --> 15:45.950]  could be in progress that's a lot of stuff to think about right there so man
[15:45.950 --> 15:48.950]  this is there's a lot to think about here I would have had a contract in
[15:48.950 --> 15:52.110]  place I would have had agreements in place I would have had goals in place
[15:52.110 --> 15:57.310]  and 500 seeds is a lot to send somebody that you don't really know at all and
[15:57.310 --> 16:02.550]  really have a bona fide relationship with so my advice your first question is
[16:02.550 --> 16:05.670]  how do I do a collab without someone fucking me over get to know people
[16:05.670 --> 16:09.310]  understand how they do business understand how they operate are they
[16:09.310 --> 16:12.270]  hiding behind the internet or are they right here transparent with their face
[16:12.270 --> 16:15.590]  out on the internet pay attention to stuff like that the second question is
[16:15.590 --> 16:20.510]  he lost my seeds shouldn't he pay me of course we shall be paid for our product
[16:20.510 --> 16:24.430]  our time and our energy but how do we determine how much that was worth
[16:24.430 --> 16:26.950]  without some sort of that's what you decide how much the car is worth before
[16:26.950 --> 16:29.670]  you test drive it so that way if you crash it they know how much you got to
[16:29.670 --> 16:34.270]  fucking pay them so my advice is next time have some contracts in place have
[16:34.270 --> 16:38.150]  some preparations in line have an agreement and stop messing with people
[16:38.150 --> 16:41.430]  who you can't trust all right thank you for the great message I would say your
[16:41.430 --> 16:45.070]  name but you did not say if you wanted on here you know who you are thank you
[16:45.070 --> 16:48.910]  my friend for the great support all right I've got one more email question
[16:48.910 --> 16:51.710]  here in front of me that I want to read on this show this one came from my buddy
[16:51.710 --> 16:55.830]  newbie nugs shout out to my buddy noob nugs what's up bro hope you're well the
[16:55.830 --> 17:00.070]  question goes a little bit like this it says hey Rasta Jeff I have a question
[17:00.070 --> 17:04.350]  about when a seed description says indica and sativa percentages is this
[17:04.350 --> 17:08.430]  just breeders opinion from the phenos they have grown or tested and seen or an
[17:08.430 --> 17:13.150]  estimation based on what's in the lineage or some lab tested data to come
[17:13.150 --> 17:17.030]  up with this number thank you for everything you do bro this is a really
[17:17.030 --> 17:20.310]  good question I think I could ramble on this one for a couple of good minutes
[17:20.310 --> 17:26.190]  here currently we are shifting away from the terms indica and sativa those are
[17:26.190 --> 17:30.210]  gonna be expired terms in the next few years we're gonna have updated new
[17:30.210 --> 17:34.590]  modern terms for that broadleaf drug cultivar and weird shit like that are
[17:34.590 --> 17:38.110]  all gonna take over but we're gonna have to reassess what we're calling indica
[17:38.110 --> 17:41.190]  and sativa one author says we got it backwards a long time ago you've been
[17:41.190 --> 17:45.590]  doing it wrong a lot of authors say that those are expired terms I know what you
[17:45.590 --> 17:49.230]  mean when you say indica and sativa so they are valid terms for the purpose
[17:49.230 --> 17:53.270]  we're using them right here most of the time an indica plant is going to be your
[17:53.270 --> 17:56.870]  shorter squatty plant with the big white leaves when you smoke it you get a
[17:56.870 --> 18:00.150]  little bit more of a mellow buzz you want to chill out the things we call
[18:00.150 --> 18:03.750]  sativa are usually a taller thinner plant with the skinnier leaves when you
[18:03.750 --> 18:07.510]  smoke that you get that psychedelic buzz you want to get up and do shit we're
[18:07.510 --> 18:10.710]  gonna stick with that description for sativa and indica for the purpose of
[18:10.710 --> 18:16.630]  this podcast question so is it just breeders opinion based on phenos they've
[18:16.630 --> 18:22.350]  grown honestly there's no really like tried and true hard and fast system or
[18:22.430 --> 18:29.030]  way to identify this it is honestly the breeders we kind of take the plant that
[18:29.030 --> 18:33.150]  we started with the two plants and we say well that one's like 50% sativa 50%
[18:33.150 --> 18:36.870]  indica this was like 70 30 and we breed them and then we have a kind of a
[18:36.870 --> 18:39.950]  prediction I've always got a prediction when I put them together then we just
[18:39.950 --> 18:44.030]  see how they grow a lot of times most of the stuff that I breed is straight-up
[18:44.030 --> 18:47.950]  sativa heavy because I am breeding for that sativa head buzz so we kind of
[18:47.950 --> 18:52.190]  watch the phenotypes that come out watch the majority of the phenotypes and then
[18:52.310 --> 18:56.830]  when I say that is 70 30 that's because out of all of the plants that I have
[18:56.830 --> 19:00.990]  seen the majority of them would be on that average it's based on the average
[19:00.990 --> 19:04.430]  of what I see there are always going to be outliers there are going to be
[19:04.430 --> 19:09.110]  phenotypical differences outliers anomalies and everything in every
[19:09.110 --> 19:12.630]  population when it comes to working with plants or anything with nature with
[19:12.630 --> 19:17.270]  genes and chromosomes any kind of breeding there will be outliers but the
[19:17.270 --> 19:20.550]  way that I compile most of my information is by watching a lot of
[19:20.670 --> 19:24.510]  grows I grow the seeds I've talked in a previous episode about testers growing
[19:24.510 --> 19:28.790]  it I give it out as freebies we start selling it I'm constantly updating
[19:28.790 --> 19:32.710]  descriptions and details about my strains as I see things evolve so
[19:32.710 --> 19:36.630]  basically the way that I do it is I watch the plants if I see traits I know
[19:36.630 --> 19:40.510]  that that's an indica trait if I watch traits I know that that's a sativa trait
[19:40.510 --> 19:45.550]  so I just decide overall by what I've seen from every version of that plant if
[19:45.550 --> 19:50.110]  you've grown a million seeds of dark hollow and I see how it grows then I say
[19:50.190 --> 19:54.750]  70% of those is an indica we're gonna call it mostly indica it just I use it
[19:54.750 --> 19:59.110]  by observation and details and then just base it off of averages of what I see is
[19:59.110 --> 20:03.070]  how I do it I cannot speak for other breeders I can't tell you how other guys
[20:03.070 --> 20:06.750]  are doing things sometimes I have no idea how they're doing some of those
[20:06.750 --> 20:11.510]  things honestly those those phrases indica and sativa are going to disappear
[20:11.510 --> 20:16.430]  I've stopped putting that on my website most of what I make is really heavy
[20:16.430 --> 20:19.990]  sativa if it's indica then I do try to indicate that this is more of an
[20:20.030 --> 20:23.390]  indica dominant thing if you're looking for indica stuff in my lineup I would
[20:23.390 --> 20:28.550]  recommend the moon tower the dark hollow maybe the double dose and in the future
[20:28.550 --> 20:32.670]  there will be some more stuff that is a little bit indica heavy for you maybe
[20:32.670 --> 20:36.350]  some indica dominant crosses coming in the future I did hint that there may be
[20:36.350 --> 20:41.750]  an indica male in the vault all right newbie nugs I do thank you for the great
[20:41.750 --> 20:45.070]  question I hope I gave you a useful answer it feels like I kind of danced
[20:45.070 --> 20:49.310]  around it and avoided it but honestly there's no real tried and true way you
[20:49.310 --> 20:52.150]  asked if there's a lab test there's not really a lab test that would tell you
[20:52.150 --> 20:56.670]  if it's indica or sativa a lot of it is based on growth structure leaf size and
[20:56.670 --> 21:00.190]  then I think a lot of it is determined by terpenes how does it feel when we
[21:00.190 --> 21:04.390]  smoke it what kind of buzz does it give us so I wish I had a better answer for
[21:04.390 --> 21:08.670]  you I make my decision by looking at plants and just deciding is this indica
[21:08.670 --> 21:13.510]  or is this sativa all right ladies and gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes
[21:13.510 --> 21:17.750]  friends and foes smokers growers clone cutters and pollen chuckers all of you
