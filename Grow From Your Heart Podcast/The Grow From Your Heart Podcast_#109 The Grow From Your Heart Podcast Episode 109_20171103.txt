[00:17.920 --> 00:20.320]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.320 --> 00:22.040]  It's time for episode number 109
[00:22.040 --> 00:24.000]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.200]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.240]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:29.240 --> 00:30.480]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.480 --> 00:32.920]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.920 --> 00:34.440]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:34.440 --> 00:35.800]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.800 --> 00:37.520]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.520 --> 00:40.280]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.600]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[00:42.600 --> 00:44.600]  I wanna thank you guys for joining me.
[00:44.600 --> 00:46.520]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.160]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band.
[00:48.160 --> 00:50.040]  Thanks for letting me use your music on my show.
[00:50.040 --> 00:53.320]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.960]  Hope everybody's having a great afternoon,
[00:55.960 --> 00:57.840]  morning, evening, whatever it is, wherever you are.
[00:57.840 --> 00:58.840]  Hope you got something rolled up.
[00:58.840 --> 01:00.600]  Hope you got a fat dab.
[01:00.600 --> 01:01.720]  Hope you got a vaporizer.
[01:01.720 --> 01:02.680]  Hope you got an edible in you.
[01:02.680 --> 01:03.800]  Hope you got something good going on.
[01:03.800 --> 01:06.520]  Hope you're getting turped out in some way, shape, or form.
[01:06.520 --> 01:08.520]  Hey guys, this is another episode that comes from the car,
[01:08.520 --> 01:10.840]  but this is a sort of a part two.
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.320]  Recently I did an episode about ways to improve your garden.
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.520]  Well, this is a part two of that episode.
[01:16.520 --> 01:18.640]  More ways on how to improve your garden.
[01:18.640 --> 01:20.880]  I also include a little rant toward the end.
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.800]  I did have to stop recording halfway through
[01:23.800 --> 01:25.520]  because I arrived at my destination,
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.320]  but I did start recording on the way home.
[01:27.320 --> 01:28.960]  So there's a little cut in the middle,
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.440]  but I hope you enjoy that.
[01:30.440 --> 01:31.280]  Before I go too far,
[01:31.280 --> 01:32.920]  this podcast is brought to you by my good friends
[01:32.920 --> 01:34.000]  at Hitman Glass.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.560]  Big shout out to the crew at Hitman Glass.
[01:36.560 --> 01:37.920]  Make sure you support Hitman Dougie
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.440]  and the entire Hitman Glass crew.
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.920]  Hitman Glass is made in America by Americans.
[01:42.920 --> 01:46.000]  Today we're hitting the Hitman and Samson collab.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.320]  This is one of my favorite rigs in my collection.
[01:48.320 --> 01:51.200]  It's got like a, I'd say a six inch tall can
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.200]  with a straight up, I don't know,
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.680]  the piece where the bolt or the nail attaches go straight up.
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.920]  It's got a mouthpiece that comes out of the side.
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.180]  It's got a beautiful green worked base,
[02:01.180 --> 02:02.520]  maybe a turquoise color in there.
[02:02.520 --> 02:05.480]  It's got a green Hitman logo here on the side.
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.800]  It's got a green Hitman flame across the mouthpiece there.
[02:09.800 --> 02:12.280]  I'm gonna do myself a fat favor
[02:12.640 --> 02:13.960]  and we're gonna take a dab
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.040]  and then we are going to get into the part of the podcast
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.000]  where I am in the car.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.920]  So I'm gonna start heating up this nail.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.240]  I'm gonna let the music fade in
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.680]  and then I will be in the car
[02:22.680 --> 02:23.880]  the next time you hear my voice.
[02:23.880 --> 02:24.840]  So I'm gonna take a dab.
[02:24.840 --> 02:25.960]  Big shout out to my friends at Hitman.
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.280]  Make sure you guys follow Hitman Glass.
[02:27.280 --> 02:29.000]  Make sure you check out hitmanglass.com.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.700]  Make sure you support them on Instagram.
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.640]  Make sure you follow Hitman Glass Dougie.
[02:32.640 --> 02:35.120]  There are a bunch of members of the Hitman fam.
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.080]  If you type in hashtag Hitfam, hashtag Hitman Glass,
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.600]  you'll find a bunch of great glass
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.640]  that you would like to follow.
[02:41.960 --> 02:42.960]  You'd like to see more of.
[02:42.960 --> 02:44.080]  Make sure you check that out.
[02:44.080 --> 02:45.800]  Shout out to Hitman Glass.
[02:45.800 --> 02:47.920]  Big thanks for supporting the show.
[02:47.920 --> 02:50.880]  Let's get on to the part with me in the car.
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.720]  Here you go guys.
[02:51.720 --> 02:54.440]  I'm gonna take a dab out of this Hitman Samson collab
[02:54.440 --> 02:56.040]  and I'll be right back with you.
[02:59.750 --> 03:01.390]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[03:01.390 --> 03:03.350]  It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you
[03:03.350 --> 03:04.810]  with another episode from the car.
[03:04.810 --> 03:07.070]  I'm headed northbound on I-25.
[03:07.070 --> 03:09.430]  I'm currently passing through the lovely town
[03:09.430 --> 03:10.570]  of Fountain, Colorado.
[03:10.570 --> 03:12.890]  I'm on my way to Colorado Springs.
[03:12.890 --> 03:15.250]  I'm headed to the Grow at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[03:15.250 --> 03:17.230]  I've gotta go do the evening check.
[03:17.230 --> 03:19.730]  We are now in flower, so I need to go check on the plants
[03:19.730 --> 03:21.450]  just before the lights go off.
[03:21.450 --> 03:22.290]  I need to go make sure
[03:22.290 --> 03:24.010]  that the timer shuts off appropriately
[03:24.010 --> 03:25.910]  and make sure that all the heating and cooling
[03:25.910 --> 03:28.210]  works the way it should for the night cycles.
[03:28.210 --> 03:29.210]  Go check on some clones.
[03:29.210 --> 03:31.930]  Anyway, been spending a lot of time on the road.
[03:31.930 --> 03:33.670]  I don't have a lot of time at home
[03:33.670 --> 03:36.010]  or studio time the past week.
[03:36.010 --> 03:39.570]  This weekend was the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational,
[03:39.570 --> 03:41.930]  so I spent most of the weekend in Colorado Springs
[03:41.970 --> 03:43.890]  with the Grimey Gatsby family.
[03:43.890 --> 03:45.650]  So I spent most of the weekend in Colorado Springs
[03:45.650 --> 03:46.970]  with the Grimey Gatsby family,
[03:46.970 --> 03:49.570]  the Dude It's Damsel crew and the Terpex boys.
[03:49.570 --> 03:52.590]  I recorded two podcasts that need to be edited
[03:52.590 --> 03:54.110]  and put together from the weekend,
[03:54.110 --> 03:56.450]  but they will be out pretty soon.
[03:56.450 --> 03:59.490]  That should be episodes 110 and maybe 112.
[03:59.490 --> 04:01.310]  I might put another episode between there.
[04:01.310 --> 04:03.650]  You never know what I'm going to do,
[04:03.650 --> 04:06.010]  but I've got a couple episodes coming to you
[04:06.010 --> 04:08.330]  from the house in Colorado Springs
[04:08.330 --> 04:12.170]  where we hosted the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational,
[04:12.170 --> 04:15.090]  a house full of models and dab kids.
[04:15.090 --> 04:18.050]  It was a pretty good time, I would have to say.
[04:18.050 --> 04:20.730]  I would recommend that you guys go to Instagram.
[04:20.730 --> 04:22.210]  If you're on Instagram, go to Instagram
[04:22.210 --> 04:24.890]  and search the hashtag Dude It's Gatsby
[04:24.890 --> 04:27.010]  and check out some of the shots we took there.
[04:27.010 --> 04:28.770]  Also check out some of the shots
[04:28.770 --> 04:31.330]  on Dude It's Damsel's Instagram
[04:31.330 --> 04:33.770]  and also on the Grimey Gatsby on Instagram.
[04:33.770 --> 04:36.270]  And of course you can check out my new Instagram,
[04:37.230 --> 04:40.710]  ireee underscore genetics on Instagram is my new page.
[04:40.710 --> 04:41.910]  I did start a new Instagram.
[04:41.910 --> 04:43.030]  You guys, I don't know if I've mentioned that
[04:43.030 --> 04:46.430]  on the podcast yet, but I am back on Instagram.
[04:46.430 --> 04:48.110]  I'm trying to follow all of the rules.
[04:48.110 --> 04:49.630]  I've been told that you can't put photos
[04:49.630 --> 04:51.230]  of yourself consuming cannabis.
[04:51.230 --> 04:54.310]  So that means no dab videos, no fat joint shots,
[04:54.310 --> 04:55.570]  none of that kind of stuff.
[04:55.570 --> 04:58.450]  And I was told that you can't have contact information
[04:58.450 --> 04:59.830]  on your Instagram.
[04:59.830 --> 05:02.790]  So I'm not going to put any contact information up there
[05:02.790 --> 05:04.550]  just to keep us safe.
[05:04.550 --> 05:05.790]  You guys know how to find me.
[05:06.310 --> 05:07.830]  Make sure you go follow the new Instagram page.
[05:07.830 --> 05:09.550]  I was at 19,000 followers.
[05:09.550 --> 05:10.650]  They took me down.
[05:10.650 --> 05:13.710]  I'm already back up to about 15 or 1600
[05:13.710 --> 05:15.190]  by the time this airs,
[05:15.190 --> 05:16.870]  hopefully with all of the shout outs and things
[05:16.870 --> 05:18.730]  from Damsel from the weekend,
[05:18.730 --> 05:20.970]  I'll be close to the 2,500 mark.
[05:20.970 --> 05:22.070]  Anyway, that's enough rambling
[05:22.070 --> 05:25.830]  about the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[05:25.830 --> 05:27.850]  I really encourage you guys to go look at some
[05:27.850 --> 05:30.830]  of the pictures that were taken on Instagram.
[05:30.830 --> 05:33.030]  And we will also post a podcast that tells you all
[05:33.030 --> 05:35.430]  about the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational,
[05:36.070 --> 05:37.870]  what it is, who was involved and why it happened.
[05:37.870 --> 05:39.150]  I've got to edit that down.
[05:39.150 --> 05:40.870]  It's a great show.
[05:40.870 --> 05:42.130]  We got stupid high, you guys.
[05:42.130 --> 05:44.350]  So it'll be a fun show to listen to.
[05:44.350 --> 05:45.990]  Anyways, I'm driving on the interstate.
[05:45.990 --> 05:46.930]  I'm kind of rambly.
[05:46.930 --> 05:48.150]  Let's talk about something.
[05:48.150 --> 05:49.110]  I've got a couple of notes here.
[05:49.110 --> 05:50.070]  They're hard to read because I'm driving,
[05:50.070 --> 05:51.630]  but I wrote this down.
[05:51.630 --> 05:54.310]  I've been watching a show on Netflix, a show called Narcos.
[05:54.310 --> 05:56.150]  It's a show about Pablo Escobar
[05:56.150 --> 05:59.070]  and his drug empire that he created.
[05:59.070 --> 06:00.750]  I had no idea the dude was so huge.
[06:00.750 --> 06:01.870]  I knew he was huge,
[06:01.870 --> 06:04.210]  but I didn't know that this dude was super huge.
[06:05.130 --> 06:06.370]  I've never seen that kind of money.
[06:06.370 --> 06:08.690]  Nobody else has ever seen that kind of money.
[06:08.690 --> 06:11.610]  That dude was building forts out of $100 bills, pretty much.
[06:11.610 --> 06:12.430]  That shit is awesome.
[06:12.430 --> 06:14.730]  Anyway, something that happens in the show Narcos.
[06:14.730 --> 06:16.170]  Narcos is on Netflix.
[06:16.170 --> 06:18.950]  It's a 10-episode season.
[06:18.950 --> 06:19.910]  I recommend you watch it.
[06:19.910 --> 06:22.450]  Something that happened recently made me chuckle.
[06:22.450 --> 06:23.710]  I wanted to come out on the show
[06:23.710 --> 06:25.450]  and say that shit will not work.
[06:26.690 --> 06:29.290]  So Pablo Escobar is standing on the balcony
[06:29.290 --> 06:30.930]  having a little thought time by himself.
[06:30.930 --> 06:32.330]  He's just thinking and reflecting
[06:32.330 --> 06:34.130]  and staring off into the nowhere.
[06:34.970 --> 06:35.810]  And then he turns to the right
[06:35.810 --> 06:37.490]  and there's a ganja plant to the right of him.
[06:37.490 --> 06:39.330]  And it looks, it's not mature.
[06:39.330 --> 06:41.210]  It's nowhere near done.
[06:41.210 --> 06:44.810]  And Pablo just grabs a little bud off the stalk
[06:44.810 --> 06:47.330]  and pinches it off and gives it a good smell
[06:47.330 --> 06:48.830]  and sticks it into his pocket.
[06:49.770 --> 06:52.250]  You guys, that may do a little for him,
[06:52.250 --> 06:53.890]  but that weed is gonna suck.
[06:53.890 --> 06:55.690]  That plant was not finished.
[06:55.690 --> 06:58.690]  You can't just pick buds off of a plant randomly.
[06:58.690 --> 07:00.230]  It's not like an apple tree.
[07:00.230 --> 07:01.070]  You gotta harvest it.
[07:01.070 --> 07:01.910]  You gotta trim it.
[07:01.910 --> 07:02.730]  You gotta dry it.
[07:02.730 --> 07:03.570]  You gotta do it properly.
[07:03.610 --> 07:04.530]  That was a little goofy,
[07:04.530 --> 07:06.130]  but everything about the cocaine,
[07:06.130 --> 07:08.050]  about the production, the shipment,
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.930]  everything about cocaine seems to be accurate.
[07:09.930 --> 07:11.450]  They've talked about how they make cocaine,
[07:11.450 --> 07:14.370]  how they process cocaine, how they hide cocaine.
[07:14.370 --> 07:16.970]  All of that has seemed to be fairly accurately done.
[07:16.970 --> 07:19.650]  But when it came to growing a little bit of weed,
[07:19.650 --> 07:22.650]  they had no idea what they were talking about on that show.
[07:22.650 --> 07:23.490]  All right, you guys.
[07:23.490 --> 07:24.570]  I wanted to mention that.
[07:24.570 --> 07:26.610]  Let's see, I talked about the Dude It's Gatsby invitation.
[07:26.610 --> 07:28.010]  I'm trying to go through my notes here.
[07:28.010 --> 07:31.850]  So this podcast is going to be a follow-up to a recent show.
[07:31.850 --> 07:33.350]  Recently I did an episode.
[07:34.130 --> 07:36.070]  It was aimed at how to improve your crop.
[07:36.070 --> 07:37.270]  Once I posted that show,
[07:37.270 --> 07:38.510]  I realized there were a couple of things
[07:38.510 --> 07:40.330]  that I really skipped.
[07:40.330 --> 07:41.390]  Things that I've been thinking about
[07:41.390 --> 07:43.270]  that would definitely help you improve your crop
[07:43.270 --> 07:45.370]  that I should have mentioned in that show.
[07:45.370 --> 07:47.190]  So let me scroll up on my phone here while I'm driving.
[07:47.190 --> 07:48.950]  Sorry, guys, you gotta be patient with me.
[07:48.950 --> 07:49.910]  I'm trying to do this safely.
[07:49.910 --> 07:51.350]  More ways to improve your crop.
[07:51.350 --> 07:54.150]  We need to talk about the importance of pH.
[07:54.150 --> 07:54.990]  You hear that?
[07:54.990 --> 07:55.810]  Sorry.
[07:55.810 --> 07:57.910]  We need to talk about the importance of pH.
[07:57.910 --> 07:59.750]  pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[07:59.750 --> 08:02.150]  pH is super important for your plants.
[08:02.150 --> 08:03.750]  When you're making a solution,
[08:03.750 --> 08:05.550]  when you're mixing your nutrients in your bucket
[08:05.550 --> 08:07.590]  or in your reservoir, however you're mixing it,
[08:07.590 --> 08:11.790]  you need to adjust the pH before you feed it to your plants.
[08:12.950 --> 08:15.190]  Mix up all of your nutrients, have everything in there.
[08:15.190 --> 08:16.470]  Get a pH meter.
[08:16.470 --> 08:18.470]  Stick your pH pen, your pH meter in there
[08:18.470 --> 08:20.070]  and see what the pH says.
[08:20.070 --> 08:22.870]  If it's like seven, it needs to come down, you guys.
[08:22.870 --> 08:24.290]  You want your pH for your plants
[08:24.290 --> 08:26.990]  to be somewhere between six and 6.5.
[08:26.990 --> 08:28.470]  I think you'd be much happier.
[08:28.470 --> 08:29.810]  Your plants will look better.
[08:29.810 --> 08:31.670]  They'll take up the nutrients more properly.
[08:32.110 --> 08:33.150]  The plants will grow better.
[08:33.150 --> 08:34.870]  You won't see as many problems.
[08:34.870 --> 08:38.070]  A lot of times a pH problem will mask itself
[08:38.070 --> 08:40.750]  as a deficiency or a nutrient burn.
[08:40.750 --> 08:43.110]  So if you just go ahead and fix your pH,
[08:43.110 --> 08:44.830]  you have to fix the pH of the solution
[08:44.830 --> 08:45.710]  you're feeding your plants.
[08:45.710 --> 08:47.770]  If you're feeding it nutrients,
[08:47.770 --> 08:49.470]  if you're feeding it water, adjust the pH.
[08:49.470 --> 08:51.030]  If you guys are feeding it teas,
[08:51.030 --> 08:54.390]  don't mess with the pH of a tea because the tea is organic.
[08:54.390 --> 08:57.110]  Trying to add something to bring down the pH of your tea
[08:57.110 --> 08:58.930]  will probably kill off your microbes
[08:58.930 --> 09:00.990]  and whatever you're trying to build up in the tea.
[09:00.990 --> 09:01.870]  So just let that go.
[09:01.870 --> 09:02.850]  That'll be fine.
[09:04.270 --> 09:06.630]  Don't stress too much on the pH of your soil.
[09:06.630 --> 09:08.850]  If you bought good soil at a growth store,
[09:08.850 --> 09:10.630]  your pH will be just fine
[09:10.630 --> 09:13.670]  as long as you're feeding it properly pH nutrients,
[09:13.670 --> 09:15.790]  a properly pH solution.
[09:15.790 --> 09:17.790]  So once you're done mixing up your nutrients,
[09:17.790 --> 09:20.030]  pH it, get some pH, get a pH pen,
[09:20.030 --> 09:21.630]  stick it in there, see what it says.
[09:21.630 --> 09:23.310]  Add very little pH down.
[09:23.310 --> 09:24.630]  If you're using a five gallon jug,
[09:24.630 --> 09:26.870]  it's not gonna take much pH down
[09:26.870 --> 09:29.310]  to get your pH to drop massively.
[09:29.310 --> 09:31.870]  So check your pH, pay attention to the pH.
[09:31.870 --> 09:33.190]  I see a lot of people skipping that.
[09:33.190 --> 09:34.310]  They think it's not important.
[09:34.310 --> 09:36.230]  They think it's not gonna mess with their plants.
[09:36.230 --> 09:38.590]  They think it's just one more thing to worry about,
[09:38.590 --> 09:40.630]  but it's one more thing that can definitely improve
[09:40.630 --> 09:43.530]  the quality of your plants.
[09:43.530 --> 09:45.670]  All right, so adjust the pH.
[09:45.670 --> 09:47.230]  Also, let's talk about the importance
[09:47.230 --> 09:49.110]  of getting the lights close enough.
[09:50.470 --> 09:52.110]  Oh, excuse me, got a clear to the throat there.
[09:52.110 --> 09:53.350]  I see a lot of people with their lights
[09:53.350 --> 09:54.470]  real high in the garden.
[09:54.470 --> 09:57.370]  If you're using Govitas, you do need that three foot gap,
[09:57.370 --> 09:59.630]  but unless you're using double ended bulbs,
[09:59.630 --> 10:02.650]  there's no need to have the bulbs way high above the plants.
[10:02.650 --> 10:07.250]  If you've got the type of hoods that are ducted
[10:07.250 --> 10:09.450]  and have glass inside of them,
[10:09.450 --> 10:10.890]  and if you're venting them properly
[10:10.890 --> 10:12.490]  and the room is air conditioned,
[10:12.490 --> 10:15.730]  you can probably get those light reflectors
[10:15.730 --> 10:17.730]  right down on top of the plants really close.
[10:17.730 --> 10:19.930]  You wanna get them, there's a section
[10:19.930 --> 10:21.670]  that comes off the bulb that is kind of too bright
[10:21.670 --> 10:25.770]  for the plant and those lumens, I guess they are,
[10:25.770 --> 10:27.930]  that are coming off the bulb right there,
[10:27.930 --> 10:29.570]  that spectrum is too much for the plant
[10:29.570 --> 10:31.170]  right around the plant, that eight to 10,
[10:31.170 --> 10:34.210]  maybe 12 inch circle around the bulb.
[10:34.210 --> 10:36.770]  But if you get a little further, about 10, 12,
[10:36.770 --> 10:38.830]  maybe 14 inches away from that thousand watt bulb,
[10:38.830 --> 10:40.930]  you're gonna get optimal growth right there.
[10:40.930 --> 10:42.490]  If you can cool it and keep it cooler,
[10:42.490 --> 10:44.490]  you can get closer and pay attention to the plants
[10:44.490 --> 10:45.690]  and see what's happening.
[10:45.690 --> 10:47.490]  But I see a lot of people that have their lights
[10:47.490 --> 10:49.170]  way too far away from the plants.
[10:49.170 --> 10:51.370]  Get your plants closer to your lights.
[10:51.370 --> 10:54.770]  You wanna get that light right on there, nice and intense.
[10:54.770 --> 10:56.570]  Light is the most used nutrient
[10:56.570 --> 10:57.890]  that your plants will receive.
[10:57.890 --> 10:59.690]  So make sure you flood them with light
[10:59.690 --> 11:02.130]  and also try to give them the appropriate light.
[11:02.130 --> 11:03.090]  If you're in the veg cycle,
[11:03.090 --> 11:05.930]  you want lights that lean more to the blue spectrum.
[11:05.930 --> 11:07.130]  If you're in the flowering cycle,
[11:07.130 --> 11:10.450]  you want lights that lead more to the red spectrum.
[11:10.450 --> 11:13.610]  All right, so make sure you've got enough light,
[11:13.610 --> 11:15.570]  try to get your plants close to the light
[11:15.570 --> 11:16.850]  and use as much as you can.
[11:16.850 --> 11:18.530]  You guys, you can burn your plants with your light,
[11:18.530 --> 11:21.010]  so pay attention to that, but get them close.
[11:21.010 --> 11:22.390]  It's what you wanna do.
[11:22.390 --> 11:24.790]  All right, let's see, what does my next note say?
[11:24.790 --> 11:28.150]  My next note says CO2 enrichment.
[11:28.150 --> 11:29.710]  I didn't write a lot of notes about this,
[11:29.710 --> 11:30.710]  but CO2 enrichment,
[11:30.710 --> 11:32.790]  if you wanna improve the quality of your crop,
[11:32.790 --> 11:35.190]  if you wanna make your plants grow more quickly,
[11:35.190 --> 11:38.310]  more heartily, and if you want bigger, fatter harvests,
[11:38.310 --> 11:40.750]  add a little bit of CO2 enrichment to your grow room.
[11:40.750 --> 11:43.070]  You can go to the growth store and you can get tanks of CO2
[11:43.070 --> 11:45.970]  and you can get a setup to distribute the CO2 properly
[11:45.970 --> 11:46.970]  through your room.
[11:46.970 --> 11:48.910]  You may have to rethink your ducting
[11:48.910 --> 11:51.470]  and your ventilation situation if you're gonna do that,
[11:51.470 --> 11:55.770]  but CO2 will drastically increase the quality of your grow.
[11:55.770 --> 11:58.130]  Maybe not the quality completely, but the harvest weight,
[11:58.130 --> 12:00.790]  you will definitely see a difference.
[12:00.790 --> 12:03.370]  The ambient air outside and in your grow room
[12:03.370 --> 12:08.370]  probably contains about 400 particles per million of CO2.
[12:08.470 --> 12:11.390]  If you get an enrichment system, maybe a CO2 burner,
[12:11.390 --> 12:14.310]  maybe some tanks, whatever you decide to do,
[12:14.310 --> 12:15.510]  you're gonna have to think about that one
[12:15.510 --> 12:16.830]  and talk to the guys at the hydro shop,
[12:16.830 --> 12:18.790]  maybe do some research on that.
[12:18.790 --> 12:20.810]  If you're gonna put CO2 in your room,
[12:20.810 --> 12:22.810]  you're gonna need to think about how to do it.
[12:22.810 --> 12:24.970]  But what my point is, you can get that CO2
[12:24.970 --> 12:26.890]  up to like 1600 PPMs.
[12:26.890 --> 12:28.890]  You can get it four times what it is
[12:28.890 --> 12:31.210]  in the natural environment and your plants will love it.
[12:31.210 --> 12:33.370]  Those plants wanna suck up the CO2.
[12:33.370 --> 12:35.390]  So you can add CO2 to your grow
[12:35.390 --> 12:39.170]  and that would greatly increase your harvest weight.
[12:39.170 --> 12:40.530]  So if you're gonna add CO2
[12:40.530 --> 12:41.930]  and you're gonna start getting bigger buds,
[12:41.930 --> 12:43.770]  something that really helps with all gardens
[12:43.770 --> 12:45.010]  and something I'm learning
[12:45.010 --> 12:47.370]  now that I'm running this giant commercial garden
[12:47.370 --> 12:48.330]  is trellising.
[12:48.330 --> 12:51.210]  You guys trellising and like a screen of green method,
[12:51.210 --> 12:53.530]  if you can set up a scrog,
[12:53.530 --> 12:56.290]  that is a huge way to improve your crop.
[12:56.290 --> 12:58.890]  You will give yourself more canopy space.
[12:58.890 --> 13:03.170]  More canopy space gives you more room to grow more buds.
[13:03.170 --> 13:04.830]  Everybody wants more buds.
[13:04.830 --> 13:06.510]  Also, you're able to get more airflow
[13:06.510 --> 13:09.210]  to the bottom of the plants, the plants like that.
[13:09.210 --> 13:12.130]  I think that a scrog is the way to go.
[13:12.130 --> 13:14.930]  I'll do a whole episode on how to do a scrog
[13:14.930 --> 13:17.330]  when I'm in the studio and I'm not on the road
[13:17.370 --> 13:19.570]  because I definitely wanna pay a little bit of attention.
[13:19.570 --> 13:21.610]  Spence and I talked about it a while back,
[13:21.610 --> 13:23.690]  but I wasn't sold on the idea
[13:23.690 --> 13:25.510]  and I wasn't exactly sure how to do it.
[13:25.510 --> 13:27.810]  So I didn't do the idea justice,
[13:27.810 --> 13:30.450]  but you guys, we will talk about how to scrog
[13:30.450 --> 13:32.050]  on a future episode.
[13:32.050 --> 13:34.510]  All right, so use some sort of trellising system,
[13:34.510 --> 13:36.370]  a screen of green, a net,
[13:36.370 --> 13:38.050]  get those plants in there and get them supported,
[13:38.050 --> 13:38.930]  get them spread out.
[13:38.930 --> 13:41.410]  That would definitely help with your garden.
[13:41.410 --> 13:43.850]  Something that I see a lot of people neglecting to do
[13:43.850 --> 13:45.510]  that I think would greatly improve
[13:45.510 --> 13:46.950]  the quality of your garden.
[13:47.570 --> 13:50.350]  It'll also save your tremors a lot of headaches, you guys.
[13:50.350 --> 13:53.010]  I think it would be really useful for you to get in there
[13:53.010 --> 13:55.390]  and lollipop your plants a little bit.
[13:55.390 --> 13:58.750]  So what that means is from the bottom of the plant up,
[13:58.750 --> 14:00.350]  take off all the branches
[14:00.350 --> 14:02.310]  that don't have a useful bud site.
[14:02.310 --> 14:03.470]  The areas that don't look like
[14:03.470 --> 14:06.390]  they're gonna create a chunky bud, just cut those off.
[14:07.370 --> 14:08.810]  About 10 days into flower,
[14:08.810 --> 14:10.670]  you'll know where you're gonna have buds.
[14:10.670 --> 14:13.150]  If the light is not getting to that area,
[14:13.150 --> 14:15.350]  just pinch that little starter of a bud,
[14:15.390 --> 14:16.950]  just pinch that right off.
[14:16.950 --> 14:18.930]  All those little tiny sucker stems
[14:18.930 --> 14:20.470]  that are growing off your main stock
[14:20.470 --> 14:21.410]  at the bottom of the plant
[14:21.410 --> 14:23.450]  that are gonna make little shitty flowers
[14:23.450 --> 14:26.750]  that nobody wants to trim, cut that shit off of there.
[14:26.750 --> 14:29.250]  And that will allow that plant to use its energy
[14:29.250 --> 14:31.190]  to produce bigger buds up top.
[14:31.190 --> 14:33.070]  You won't have all that crap on the bottom.
[14:33.070 --> 14:35.110]  You'll get better airflow.
[14:35.110 --> 14:36.270]  A lot of people say they wanna use
[14:36.270 --> 14:37.390]  those bottom buds for hash.
[14:37.390 --> 14:39.070]  That's cool if you wanna do that.
[14:39.070 --> 14:41.070]  If you're trying to grow buds with bag of peel,
[14:41.070 --> 14:44.510]  big fatty, chunky nuggets, cut that stuff off of there
[14:44.510 --> 14:46.190]  and you will have better results,
[14:46.190 --> 14:47.470]  you'll have better airflow.
[14:47.470 --> 14:48.430]  And then you won't have to trim
[14:48.430 --> 14:49.630]  all that little popcorn crap
[14:49.630 --> 14:50.790]  because that's what sucks at the end.
[14:50.790 --> 14:51.870]  All that just gets chopped up
[14:51.870 --> 14:53.550]  and put into the hash pile anyway.
[14:53.550 --> 14:55.350]  So do some lollipopping,
[14:55.350 --> 14:57.270]  get in there and clean all the bottom buds,
[14:57.270 --> 14:59.630]  all the, just the bottom crap off the plant
[14:59.630 --> 15:02.050]  before it even has time to suck up the nutrients
[15:02.050 --> 15:03.630]  and suck up the energy of the plant.
[15:03.630 --> 15:04.830]  Just get that right off of there
[15:04.830 --> 15:07.470]  and allow that energy to go up to the top.
[15:07.470 --> 15:08.570]  All right.
[15:08.570 --> 15:11.750]  So let's see, something that people really don't think about
[15:11.750 --> 15:14.310]  that I think could truly benefit the quality of your garden
[15:15.110 --> 15:15.950]  and the health of your plants,
[15:15.950 --> 15:17.390]  the overall health of your plants.
[15:18.430 --> 15:19.990]  It's winter time here in Colorado
[15:19.990 --> 15:22.830]  and the grow room floor is getting cold.
[15:22.830 --> 15:24.950]  My personal grow is in a basement.
[15:24.950 --> 15:26.030]  Something I would recommend,
[15:26.030 --> 15:28.150]  get your pots up off the ground, you guys.
[15:28.150 --> 15:29.670]  Get your plants off the ground.
[15:29.670 --> 15:30.830]  A really easy way to do it,
[15:30.830 --> 15:31.950]  if you can't build something,
[15:31.950 --> 15:33.150]  if you can't build a table,
[15:33.150 --> 15:35.830]  I would recommend getting like a four by four
[15:35.830 --> 15:38.470]  botanic care tray and just build yourself a little table
[15:38.470 --> 15:40.530]  that'll support the tray and your plants.
[15:40.530 --> 15:42.510]  Just lift it up, whatever's comfortable for you,
[15:42.510 --> 15:44.230]  two to four feet off the ground.
[15:45.030 --> 15:46.230]  Usually about 30 inches is the height people go.
[15:46.230 --> 15:48.110]  36 inches is kind of high for me.
[15:48.110 --> 15:49.910]  I'm tall, I don't need it that high.
[15:50.870 --> 15:52.630]  So just get your plants up off the ground.
[15:52.630 --> 15:54.070]  The floor is cold.
[15:54.070 --> 15:56.630]  You don't want those cold pots on the cold floor.
[15:56.630 --> 15:57.510]  You're gonna water them.
[15:57.510 --> 15:58.870]  The water is gonna stay in the pot.
[15:58.870 --> 16:00.890]  You've got water down there in the root ball
[16:00.890 --> 16:02.390]  and that water is gonna get cold
[16:02.390 --> 16:05.070]  because the floor is so cold when the lights go off at night.
[16:05.070 --> 16:06.630]  So raise your pots up off the ground.
[16:06.630 --> 16:09.110]  I was gonna tell you a cheap and effective way to do that.
[16:09.110 --> 16:10.310]  Buy an extra pot.
[16:10.310 --> 16:11.790]  If you're running a seven gallon pot
[16:11.790 --> 16:13.230]  and you've got your plant in there,
[16:13.230 --> 16:14.910]  get yourself another seven gallon pot
[16:14.910 --> 16:16.150]  and flip it upside down
[16:16.150 --> 16:18.270]  and just set your seven gallon pot right on top of there
[16:18.270 --> 16:19.670]  and you'll be just fine.
[16:19.670 --> 16:21.110]  So that's a cheap, effective way
[16:21.110 --> 16:23.110]  to get your plants up off the ground.
[16:23.110 --> 16:23.950]  Your plants are gonna,
[16:23.950 --> 16:26.390]  it's gonna look like your plants are happier
[16:26.390 --> 16:28.510]  just one night of having them up off the ground.
[16:28.510 --> 16:29.510]  They'll grow more quickly.
[16:29.510 --> 16:31.750]  The buds will develop much larger.
[16:31.750 --> 16:32.790]  It'll taste better.
[16:32.790 --> 16:34.230]  The plants will act happier.
[16:34.230 --> 16:35.990]  And that cold floor will also describe,
[16:35.990 --> 16:38.670]  disguise itself as a pH or a nutrient problem.
[16:38.670 --> 16:40.930]  You'll be thinking, what's going on with my crop?
[16:40.930 --> 16:43.570]  Your floor is too cold and your plants are pissed off.
[16:43.570 --> 16:44.690]  You don't like to get up in the morning
[16:44.690 --> 16:46.570]  and walk across a cold floor on your bare feet.
[16:46.570 --> 16:47.490]  That sucks.
[16:47.490 --> 16:49.010]  So don't make your plants do it.
[16:49.010 --> 16:50.430]  Get them up off the ground.
[16:50.430 --> 16:51.290]  And that may help you get them
[16:51.290 --> 16:53.170]  a little bit closer to the light as well.
[16:53.170 --> 16:54.450]  I may have just put you in danger
[16:54.450 --> 16:55.610]  of getting too close to the light,
[16:55.610 --> 16:57.330]  but that's something that the trellising
[16:57.330 --> 16:58.930]  we're gonna talk about in another episode
[16:58.930 --> 17:00.210]  will help you out with.
[17:00.210 --> 17:02.570]  So get your plants up off the ground, you guys.
[17:02.570 --> 17:03.570]  I'm in a traffic area
[17:03.570 --> 17:05.870]  so I can't really look at my notes right now.
[17:06.990 --> 17:08.070]  So while I'm driving right here,
[17:08.070 --> 17:09.910]  I'm just gonna give a huge shout out to Hitman Glass
[17:09.910 --> 17:11.870]  because Hitman Glass sponsors the show
[17:11.870 --> 17:13.430]  and there's nothing like taking a fat dab
[17:13.430 --> 17:14.430]  out of a Hitman rig.
[17:14.430 --> 17:15.830]  All right, we're getting out of the traffic area.
[17:15.830 --> 17:17.490]  I can look down at the phone once again
[17:17.490 --> 17:20.030]  and see what the next one is.
[17:20.030 --> 17:21.110]  All right, here we go.
[17:21.110 --> 17:23.770]  Check your PPMs of your solution.
[17:23.770 --> 17:25.350]  When you guys are mixing up your nutrients
[17:25.350 --> 17:28.550]  to feed your plants, pay attention to the PPMs.
[17:28.550 --> 17:31.030]  PPM stands for particles per million.
[17:31.030 --> 17:34.270]  That will tell you how much stuff is in the water
[17:34.270 --> 17:36.310]  or the solution that you have created.
[17:36.310 --> 17:38.210]  So if you're using reverse osmosis water,
[17:38.210 --> 17:40.570]  it'll start off at zero PPMs.
[17:40.570 --> 17:43.390]  Most tap water is gonna come out fairly low.
[17:43.390 --> 17:46.730]  The tap water where I am at home comes out about 400 PPMs.
[17:46.730 --> 17:49.230]  It changes seasonally, they add stuff to it,
[17:49.230 --> 17:52.090]  but we're usually about the 400 PPM area.
[17:52.090 --> 17:55.750]  You can feed your plants, if you know what you're doing,
[17:55.750 --> 17:57.010]  you can feed them really high.
[17:57.010 --> 17:58.550]  I've gotten into the 2000s.
[17:58.550 --> 18:02.330]  People tell me I'm crazy for feeding my plants 2000 PPMs,
[18:02.330 --> 18:04.850]  but I'm paying very close attention to what I'm giving them.
[18:04.850 --> 18:07.110]  I'm not doubling up on anything.
[18:07.110 --> 18:09.030]  They're getting a broad array of nutrients
[18:09.030 --> 18:11.190]  instead of just getting really heavily blasted
[18:11.190 --> 18:12.350]  with phosphorus.
[18:12.350 --> 18:15.230]  So I would recommend that you don't go much higher
[18:15.230 --> 18:18.270]  than like 1200 PPMs when you're mixing up your nutrients.
[18:18.270 --> 18:20.950]  What you can do, if you've got a big reservoir,
[18:20.950 --> 18:22.750]  if you're using, this is gonna be a little harder
[18:22.750 --> 18:23.970]  if you're using a five gallon bucket
[18:23.970 --> 18:25.710]  because you don't get as much wiggle room,
[18:25.710 --> 18:29.150]  but if you're using like a 25 gallon res
[18:29.150 --> 18:31.870]  or a 50 gallon res from the Hydro Shop,
[18:31.870 --> 18:33.790]  fill it up maybe like 40 gallons.
[18:33.790 --> 18:36.190]  If you've got a 50 gallon res, fill it up to about 40 gallons.
[18:36.190 --> 18:38.950]  If you've got a 25, fill it up to about 15 or 20,
[18:38.950 --> 18:41.310]  then mix your nutrients the way you normally would,
[18:41.310 --> 18:42.630]  put your PPM meter in there,
[18:42.630 --> 18:44.390]  and it's gonna show you that it's too high right now,
[18:44.390 --> 18:47.070]  but all you gotta do is just run normal water
[18:47.070 --> 18:48.670]  or if you've got reverse osmosis water,
[18:48.670 --> 18:52.750]  just add normal clean non-solution mixed water to it
[18:52.750 --> 18:56.150]  until it comes to about 16 or 1800 PPMs
[18:56.150 --> 18:57.710]  and feed that to your plant.
[18:57.710 --> 18:59.590]  You can mix it up and then dilute it
[18:59.590 --> 19:01.390]  until it's at the right dilution
[19:01.390 --> 19:02.910]  and everything will be at the right ratios.
[19:02.910 --> 19:05.150]  You've still mixed the same amount of grow A,
[19:05.150 --> 19:07.790]  the same amount of grow B, the same amount of Cal and Mag,
[19:07.790 --> 19:09.270]  everything will be the same,
[19:09.270 --> 19:11.470]  it's just you've kind of diluted it to a proper solution
[19:11.470 --> 19:12.790]  that your plants are gonna love.
[19:12.790 --> 19:15.310]  And then take notes, feed your plants the solution
[19:15.310 --> 19:18.150]  that was at 1600 PPMs and see how they react.
[19:18.150 --> 19:20.190]  If you think you wanna mix it a little heavier next time
[19:20.190 --> 19:22.710]  and mix it up to 18, feed it to them and see what they do.
[19:22.710 --> 19:25.070]  Don't go too heavy, don't go past 18,
[19:25.070 --> 19:26.710]  pay attention to your PPMs,
[19:26.710 --> 19:27.870]  but I think that is something
[19:27.870 --> 19:29.190]  that will really help you guys out.
[19:29.190 --> 19:30.710]  This guy just passed me on the right
[19:30.710 --> 19:32.950]  going about 90 miles an hour playing on his phone.
[19:32.950 --> 19:33.790]  That's crazy shit.
[19:33.790 --> 19:34.630]  I can't talk too much shit,
[19:34.630 --> 19:35.990]  I'm doing a podcast while I drive,
[19:35.990 --> 19:38.070]  but still at least put your phone down
[19:38.070 --> 19:39.590]  if you're gonna pass me on the right.
[19:39.590 --> 19:42.110]  All right, you guys, I'm coming up on the Fillmore exit.
[19:42.110 --> 19:43.510]  I'm gonna go handle some plants
[19:43.510 --> 19:45.310]  at the Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[19:45.310 --> 19:48.190]  I will be back in the car in just a couple hours
[19:48.190 --> 19:50.350]  and I will do more of this podcast
[19:50.350 --> 19:51.970]  and we will all have a good time.
[19:51.970 --> 19:54.110]  So hang out, I'll be right back.
[19:54.110 --> 19:56.550]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[19:56.550 --> 19:57.910]  It's your boy Rasta Jeff.
[19:57.910 --> 19:59.750]  I just got done putting in about two and a half
[19:59.750 --> 20:01.670]  or three hours in the grow.
[20:01.710 --> 20:03.630]  I had to fill up some reservoirs.
[20:03.630 --> 20:06.470]  We've got three gigantic reservoirs.
[20:06.470 --> 20:07.910]  We've got a drip system set up
[20:07.910 --> 20:10.590]  to where every about two and a half hours,
[20:10.590 --> 20:12.790]  the drip system comes on for about a minute and a half
[20:12.790 --> 20:14.150]  and waters the plants.
[20:14.150 --> 20:17.050]  So I just have to make sure that the reservoirs are full,
[20:17.050 --> 20:18.070]  full that they're filled
[20:18.070 --> 20:20.630]  and they are mixed with nutrients and properly pH.
[20:20.630 --> 20:23.170]  So I did that, I checked on the clones.
[20:23.170 --> 20:24.190]  The clones look marvelous.
[20:24.190 --> 20:26.270]  I'm not really good at cutting clones in rock wool,
[20:26.270 --> 20:28.950]  but this batch is looking pretty nice for me.
[20:28.950 --> 20:30.070]  I checked on all the plants.
[20:30.070 --> 20:31.430]  The plants look glorious.
[20:32.190 --> 20:34.110]  I'm gonna show you guys, today is day two of flower.
[20:34.110 --> 20:34.950]  They're taking off.
[20:34.950 --> 20:36.470]  I can see that they've already started to stretch
[20:36.470 --> 20:38.310]  a little tiny bit since yesterday.
[20:38.310 --> 20:39.350]  I know that sounds ridiculous,
[20:39.350 --> 20:42.270]  but they have definitely done some growth.
[20:42.270 --> 20:44.190]  So I checked the tanks, I checked the clones,
[20:44.190 --> 20:45.070]  I checked on all the plants.
[20:45.070 --> 20:45.950]  The plants look happy.
[20:45.950 --> 20:47.150]  They're starting to flower.
[20:47.150 --> 20:48.170]  They're not showing, but I mean,
[20:48.170 --> 20:50.750]  they're starting the flowering phase now.
[20:50.750 --> 20:53.470]  And then I had to tinker with the Govita controller.
[20:53.470 --> 20:55.110]  So we got that working all set up.
[20:55.110 --> 20:58.070]  Those plants are gonna be super duper happy.
[20:58.070 --> 21:00.830]  Now I'm on the road headed south back to Pueblo
[21:01.190 --> 21:02.710]  from lovely Colorado Springs.
[21:02.710 --> 21:03.630]  It is now dark.
[21:03.630 --> 21:06.190]  The temperature has dropped dramatically.
[21:06.190 --> 21:09.390]  I'm just now headed past the, which exit am I at here?
[21:09.390 --> 21:12.910]  The Fort Carson, the Mesa Ridge Parkway, Fort Carson exit.
[21:12.910 --> 21:14.770]  We're at mile marker 132.
[21:14.770 --> 21:15.750]  None of that is relevant.
[21:15.750 --> 21:18.870]  I'm just talking because it is what's on my mind.
[21:18.870 --> 21:21.650]  Let's get back to where we were, you guys.
[21:21.650 --> 21:23.430]  This episode was about ways,
[21:23.430 --> 21:26.030]  more ways to improve your garden.
[21:26.030 --> 21:27.510]  We talked about CO2 enrichment.
[21:27.510 --> 21:29.010]  We talked a little bit about trellising.
[21:29.010 --> 21:31.910]  I wanna talk about trellising for a second.
[21:32.970 --> 21:34.490]  So trellising, we'll go back to that.
[21:34.490 --> 21:36.210]  Trellising is when you take like a net,
[21:36.210 --> 21:39.370]  like a five by five net with about either
[21:39.370 --> 21:42.850]  four inch or six inch squares, spaces between the netting.
[21:42.850 --> 21:45.250]  You got about four inch or six inch holes in there.
[21:45.250 --> 21:47.670]  So I would take the net and just,
[21:47.670 --> 21:48.690]  you gotta stretch it tight,
[21:48.690 --> 21:50.530]  but build like a five foot frame
[21:50.530 --> 21:51.770]  or attach it to some poles
[21:51.770 --> 21:54.110]  and just lay that right over the canopy of your plants
[21:54.110 --> 21:55.490]  while you're in veg.
[21:55.490 --> 21:58.110]  Just drop that right over and pull it tight.
[21:58.110 --> 22:01.870]  And then what I do is I grab the branches from the plants
[22:01.870 --> 22:04.110]  and I make sure that one branch is sticking through
[22:04.110 --> 22:06.430]  each square of that trellis.
[22:06.430 --> 22:08.350]  So this will, it'll do a few things.
[22:08.350 --> 22:09.750]  It'll separate the plant.
[22:09.750 --> 22:11.110]  It's where you don't have a bunch of branches
[22:11.110 --> 22:12.870]  all clumped up into one area,
[22:12.870 --> 22:16.150]  which will allow more of the plant to get more light.
[22:16.150 --> 22:18.470]  It will also work as a support for the plant.
[22:18.470 --> 22:21.110]  When the plant starts getting chunky buds
[22:21.110 --> 22:22.790]  and the plant starts getting taller and stretching,
[22:22.790 --> 22:23.910]  it's gonna need some support.
[22:23.910 --> 22:27.050]  So every branch will be supported by this trellis.
[22:27.050 --> 22:29.410]  So it'll also spread the plant out.
[22:29.410 --> 22:31.250]  It'll give you a little space and it'll do,
[22:31.250 --> 22:33.410]  it'll create what I call the little grid.
[22:33.410 --> 22:34.570]  You'll be able to grow on the grid.
[22:34.570 --> 22:37.890]  You'll have more bud sites per square foot than most people
[22:37.890 --> 22:39.690]  because you have gone and stretched out your canopy
[22:39.690 --> 22:40.850]  and spread it out in this trellis.
[22:40.850 --> 22:44.050]  So in veg, a couple of weeks before flower,
[22:44.050 --> 22:46.550]  drop that trellis on and start making the plants grow
[22:46.550 --> 22:48.050]  into the trellis and get them stretched out
[22:48.050 --> 22:49.290]  the way you want.
[22:49.290 --> 22:50.690]  Then I would recommend flowering.
[22:50.690 --> 22:51.850]  Once they're all up through there,
[22:51.850 --> 22:54.130]  you've got a node coming through every part of the trellis.
[22:54.130 --> 22:56.650]  You're comfortable with the height of your plants.
[22:57.290 --> 22:58.490]  And you guys, if something's getting too high,
[22:58.490 --> 23:00.050]  all you gotta do is grab it and bend it down
[23:00.050 --> 23:01.490]  back under that trellis.
[23:01.490 --> 23:03.010]  And then it'll start growing up again.
[23:03.010 --> 23:04.330]  Cannabis wants to grow up.
[23:04.330 --> 23:05.150]  That's what it'll do.
[23:05.150 --> 23:07.890]  So if you bend a branch down and stick it in that trellis,
[23:07.890 --> 23:09.410]  it will grow itself back up.
[23:09.410 --> 23:12.610]  So after a couple of weeks, you put the plants in flower
[23:12.610 --> 23:15.730]  after they've veged into the trellis and grown comfortably.
[23:15.730 --> 23:17.530]  Then you put them in flower.
[23:17.530 --> 23:19.870]  And then just a couple of weeks after flower,
[23:19.870 --> 23:21.170]  maybe 10 days after flower,
[23:21.170 --> 23:22.950]  I would recommend putting up another trellis,
[23:22.950 --> 23:25.370]  maybe less than 10 days, maybe seven days.
[23:25.370 --> 23:28.410]  Put up another trellis just about 18 inches higher
[23:28.410 --> 23:29.650]  than that first one.
[23:29.650 --> 23:31.210]  Your plants are gonna start budding
[23:31.210 --> 23:33.010]  and they're gonna grow right into that trellis,
[23:33.010 --> 23:35.330]  maybe 16 inches if you're at a home grow.
[23:35.330 --> 23:36.270]  We're doing a commercial grow.
[23:36.270 --> 23:38.930]  We're going about 18 inches to give them some space.
[23:38.930 --> 23:41.650]  Maybe 24, just depends on how fast they grow by then.
[23:41.650 --> 23:43.570]  But you want them to grow up into that trellis
[23:43.570 --> 23:46.450]  to where those top colas have more space to lean.
[23:46.450 --> 23:48.890]  They're gonna kind of lean on those trellis wires.
[23:48.890 --> 23:50.750]  So make sure you pull the trellis tight
[23:50.750 --> 23:51.590]  when you put it up there.
[23:51.590 --> 23:54.050]  Get it at the right height to begin with.
[23:54.050 --> 23:55.890]  Pull the branch nodes through that trellis.
[23:55.890 --> 23:56.770]  Don't be shy.
[23:56.770 --> 23:57.890]  Be careful not to break them,
[23:57.890 --> 23:59.450]  but don't be shy to get in there
[23:59.450 --> 24:00.890]  and just kind of reshape that plant.
[24:00.890 --> 24:02.990]  Make it go the direction you want.
[24:02.990 --> 24:06.210]  And then get it growing into that trellis squares
[24:06.210 --> 24:08.930]  and then add the other trellis a little bit into flower
[24:08.930 --> 24:10.850]  and then keep the buds growing through that.
[24:10.850 --> 24:13.450]  And you'll be able to create more bud sites,
[24:13.450 --> 24:16.390]  more buds, more harvest weight without adding more light
[24:16.390 --> 24:18.490]  or without using more space in your grow room.
[24:18.490 --> 24:20.610]  And I find that to be a huge improvement.
[24:20.610 --> 24:22.430]  So something else I wanna touch on, you guys.
[24:22.430 --> 24:25.550]  This is a major important factor that people overlook.
[24:27.110 --> 24:30.350]  They say that cleanliness is next to godliness.
[24:30.350 --> 24:32.230]  So something that would really improve your garden,
[24:32.230 --> 24:34.530]  you guys, just clean up after yourselves.
[24:34.530 --> 24:35.870]  Get in the garden and clean up.
[24:35.870 --> 24:38.590]  If it doesn't need to be in there, take it out of there.
[24:38.590 --> 24:40.490]  You don't need to have the broom and dustpan in there
[24:40.490 --> 24:42.270]  overnight when you're not using it.
[24:42.270 --> 24:44.190]  If you've got a trash can in your grow room,
[24:44.190 --> 24:45.270]  make sure there's a lid on it.
[24:45.270 --> 24:46.990]  I would recommend taking that trash can
[24:46.990 --> 24:48.630]  out of the grow room at night.
[24:48.630 --> 24:49.790]  Don't have anything in the room
[24:49.790 --> 24:51.590]  that doesn't need to be in there.
[24:51.590 --> 24:53.750]  Clean up all that crap in the corner,
[24:53.750 --> 24:54.750]  whatever you've got over there.
[24:54.750 --> 24:56.790]  If it's your nutrients, if it's your notes,
[24:56.790 --> 24:58.510]  if it's your gear, clean that up.
[24:58.510 --> 24:59.950]  Take that out of the grow room.
[24:59.950 --> 25:01.390]  If you've got leaves on the floor,
[25:01.390 --> 25:03.470]  get those leaves up off the floor.
[25:03.470 --> 25:04.550]  Now here's something I'm gonna
[25:04.550 --> 25:06.170]  kinda contradict myself with,
[25:06.170 --> 25:08.270]  but I think it's really important
[25:08.270 --> 25:10.590]  to have a super clean grow room.
[25:10.590 --> 25:13.910]  Cleanliness will keep bugs away.
[25:13.910 --> 25:16.470]  Cleanliness just helps you keep everything more organized.
[25:16.470 --> 25:17.930]  It keeps healthier plants.
[25:18.930 --> 25:21.670]  But here's something that I'm gonna add to this.
[25:21.670 --> 25:23.070]  Around week six or seven,
[25:23.070 --> 25:25.550]  your plants are gonna start getting really sticky.
[25:25.550 --> 25:27.090]  They're gonna start producing resin.
[25:27.090 --> 25:28.850]  The trichomes are gonna get fat.
[25:28.850 --> 25:32.010]  The plants are gonna want to stick to everything.
[25:32.010 --> 25:33.610]  If you're a girl or a dude with long hair,
[25:33.610 --> 25:34.890]  you'll notice that every time you walk
[25:34.890 --> 25:37.410]  past the ganja plants, you leave some hair in them.
[25:37.410 --> 25:38.530]  If you're a pot photographer,
[25:38.530 --> 25:40.810]  you'll notice that every time you try to take a picture,
[25:40.810 --> 25:42.850]  that one killer bud has got a dog hair
[25:42.850 --> 25:44.970]  or a people hair or a kitty hair
[25:44.970 --> 25:47.050]  or some kind of hair in it.
[25:47.050 --> 25:49.290]  What I'm getting at you guys is these sticky plants
[25:49.290 --> 25:51.210]  love to collect everything.
[25:51.210 --> 25:54.230]  And you're gonna give them about 21 to 25 days
[25:54.230 --> 25:56.170]  of straight sticky collection time.
[25:56.170 --> 25:58.490]  They're gonna be sticky for three weeks.
[25:58.490 --> 26:00.690]  So in that whole time, they're acting like flypaper
[26:00.690 --> 26:03.410]  and just collecting everything that's in that room.
[26:03.410 --> 26:07.610]  So my advice to you guys is try to control the dust
[26:07.610 --> 26:09.250]  that's in the air in your grow room.
[26:09.250 --> 26:11.770]  Try to control the particulates and hair
[26:11.770 --> 26:12.970]  that is flying around,
[26:12.970 --> 26:15.130]  that are flying around in your grow room.
[26:15.130 --> 26:16.850]  Try to minimize all of that stuff
[26:17.650 --> 26:18.610]  because it's going to stick to your buds
[26:18.610 --> 26:20.250]  and end up in your buds.
[26:20.250 --> 26:23.450]  And these days, most of the people in Colorado
[26:23.450 --> 26:26.570]  and California in a legal state that are producing a grow,
[26:26.570 --> 26:30.310]  at least half of the grows are being turned into extracts,
[26:30.310 --> 26:32.570]  which means they're being blasted with butane.
[26:32.570 --> 26:34.490]  They're being turned into water hash.
[26:34.490 --> 26:37.010]  They're being turned into some sort of concentrate.
[26:38.010 --> 26:39.610]  What's gonna happen is you're gonna take,
[26:39.610 --> 26:41.050]  so you're in your grow room, right?
[26:41.050 --> 26:42.570]  And you're not cleaning up after yourself
[26:42.570 --> 26:44.290]  and you're mixing soil for your next batch
[26:44.290 --> 26:45.490]  or whatever you do in there.
[26:45.490 --> 26:46.930]  And you get dust all in the air.
[26:46.930 --> 26:48.610]  You get soil all in the air.
[26:48.610 --> 26:51.450]  All of that shit is going to stick to your trichomes,
[26:51.450 --> 26:52.450]  all of it.
[26:52.450 --> 26:54.330]  And then you're gonna smoke those plants
[26:54.330 --> 26:55.850]  and they're gonna taste like dusty dirt.
[26:55.850 --> 26:58.370]  And then you're gonna extract it and make hash out of it.
[26:58.370 --> 27:01.930]  And all that dust and dirt and shit and dog hair
[27:01.930 --> 27:03.850]  is going to be in your concentrates.
[27:03.850 --> 27:06.430]  So I really recommend you keep the grow room clean,
[27:06.430 --> 27:09.970]  try to minimize dust and hair in the air.
[27:09.970 --> 27:11.770]  You can get a carbon scrubber.
[27:11.770 --> 27:14.690]  Just throw a tall carbon filter on the floor,
[27:14.690 --> 27:16.970]  point it straight up, put a blower on top of it
[27:16.970 --> 27:20.010]  and just let put that sucker by your door,
[27:20.010 --> 27:21.130]  kind of near the door.
[27:21.130 --> 27:23.490]  So that way any air that is drawn in,
[27:23.490 --> 27:25.410]  any particles will get sucked up
[27:25.410 --> 27:27.610]  by your carbon filter, hopefully.
[27:27.610 --> 27:30.150]  And also on any intakes going into the room,
[27:30.150 --> 27:31.890]  I would recommend putting a HEPA filter
[27:31.890 --> 27:35.050]  over all of the holes or all of the ducting into the room.
[27:35.050 --> 27:38.170]  So you're not bringing in crap from outside.
[27:38.170 --> 27:41.450]  I definitely don't recommend bringing in air
[27:41.450 --> 27:43.530]  from the outside that has not been filtered
[27:43.530 --> 27:45.530]  and treated for temperature.
[27:45.530 --> 27:46.970]  Right now it's the winter.
[27:46.970 --> 27:48.610]  If you were to bring in,
[27:48.610 --> 27:51.130]  it's gonna be probably 20 something degrees tonight,
[27:51.130 --> 27:52.330]  I'm guessing.
[27:52.330 --> 27:53.770]  If you're running your lights at night
[27:53.770 --> 27:56.570]  and you bring in that 20 degree air over your plants,
[27:56.570 --> 27:58.250]  you're gonna cause powdery mildew issue.
[27:58.250 --> 28:00.090]  You're bringing in frosty cold air,
[28:00.090 --> 28:02.370]  you're introducing it into a warm grow room environment.
[28:02.370 --> 28:06.530]  That is a great way to create powdery mildew situations.
[28:06.530 --> 28:09.490]  So pay attention to what you're bringing in the room,
[28:09.490 --> 28:10.330]  be clean.
[28:10.330 --> 28:11.290]  That's my point, you guys.
[28:11.290 --> 28:14.230]  Every leaf on the floor is a spot for a bug to hide.
[28:14.230 --> 28:16.170]  Every piece of crap that you've got in there
[28:16.170 --> 28:17.770]  is another place for a bug to hide.
[28:17.770 --> 28:20.730]  It's a place for a mold spore to start growing.
[28:20.730 --> 28:21.570]  Just be clean.
[28:21.570 --> 28:25.050]  Cleanliness is very important in the grow room.
[28:25.050 --> 28:26.690]  All right, you guys, I think that's what I've got for you
[28:26.690 --> 28:29.850]  for ways to improve your garden for now.
[28:31.210 --> 28:32.050]  All right, guys, I wanna thank you
[28:32.050 --> 28:33.250]  for listening to another episode.
[28:33.250 --> 28:34.710]  I don't think that the car episodes
[28:34.710 --> 28:36.970]  are up to my quality standards.
[28:36.970 --> 28:38.810]  The sound quality and the amount of attention
[28:38.810 --> 28:40.210]  I am allowed to give a show
[28:40.210 --> 28:42.010]  doesn't seem like it's fair to the listener.
[28:42.010 --> 28:44.890]  I am going to probably stop doing the car episodes.
[28:44.890 --> 28:47.730]  If I do a car episode, it'll just be something ranty.
[28:47.730 --> 28:50.530]  It won't be something educational or detailed.
[28:50.530 --> 28:51.370]  So I appreciate it.
[28:51.370 --> 28:52.490]  If you made it through this episode,
[28:52.490 --> 28:54.310]  I truly do appreciate it.
[28:54.310 --> 28:55.150]  Thanks for listening.
[28:55.150 --> 28:57.930]  I'll be back next week with the Dude It's Damsel
[28:57.930 --> 29:00.090]  or the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational Recap
[29:00.090 --> 29:02.810]  that features the lovely Dude It's Damsel.
[29:02.810 --> 29:05.450]  We've got Hunt on the mic for a little bit of that show
[29:05.450 --> 29:07.250]  and four other lovely ladies.
[29:07.250 --> 29:10.250]  Our friend Chris from the Clitter jumps in for a little bit.
[29:10.250 --> 29:11.210]  It's a great podcast.
[29:11.210 --> 29:12.570]  I'll have that edited and cleaned up
[29:12.570 --> 29:15.130]  and ready for you guys by next Monday.
[29:15.130 --> 29:16.690]  So I got seven days to get that out for you.
[29:16.690 --> 29:17.890]  No worries at all.
[29:17.890 --> 29:20.050]  You guys, make sure you check out our sponsors.
[29:20.050 --> 29:21.370]  Don't forget about Hitman Glass.
[29:21.370 --> 29:22.450]  This podcast is brought to you
[29:22.450 --> 29:24.230]  by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[29:24.230 --> 29:27.690]  Hitman Glass, glass made in America by Americans.
[29:27.690 --> 29:28.530]  You guys, I've said it before.
[29:28.530 --> 29:29.470]  When I'm shopping for a rig,
[29:29.470 --> 29:31.370]  I like to know that what I'm paying for
[29:31.370 --> 29:33.090]  is gonna give me a big fat dab.
[29:33.090 --> 29:34.850]  I don't wanna get water splashed in my face.
[29:34.850 --> 29:35.890]  I don't wanna get a dry dab
[29:35.890 --> 29:37.530]  because there's not enough water in there.
[29:37.530 --> 29:39.930]  You guys, don't trust a rig that was made in China
[29:39.930 --> 29:42.170]  by a Chinese kid with no eye protection.
[29:42.170 --> 29:43.330]  Probably wasn't wearing shoes.
[29:43.330 --> 29:44.670]  He didn't get paid enough.
[29:44.670 --> 29:46.230]  Don't buy some glass made in China, you guys.
[29:46.230 --> 29:48.650]  Buy American glass made by an American.
[29:48.650 --> 29:50.330]  It'll make you feel better.
[29:50.330 --> 29:52.610]  Hitman's not only a glass company, you guys.
[29:52.610 --> 29:53.890]  Hitman Dougie is a huge part
[29:53.890 --> 29:55.690]  of the cannabis and hash movement.
[29:55.690 --> 29:57.490]  Support Hitman Glass and be sure to check out

[30:08.810 --> 30:09.890]  You guys, as I'm recording right now,
[30:09.890 --> 30:12.890]  I'm taking dabs out of the Hitman and Samson collab.
[30:12.890 --> 30:15.330]  This is one of my favorite rigs in my collection.
[30:15.330 --> 30:17.130]  I've got several Hitman rigs.
[30:17.130 --> 30:19.670]  This is one of the top two, I think.
[30:19.670 --> 30:22.210]  This one in the E-Series sidecar might be the favorite.
[30:22.210 --> 30:24.530]  I will hit the next favorite on the next podcast.
[30:24.530 --> 30:26.230]  So you guys, make sure you support Hitman Glass.
[30:26.230 --> 30:27.750]  Big shout out to Hitman Dougie.
[30:27.750 --> 30:30.690]  Big shout out to the whole Hit fam, the Hitman crew.
[30:30.690 --> 30:32.710]  Much love, much respect, much support.
[30:32.710 --> 30:35.290]  I love being able to rely on a sweet rig.
[30:36.010 --> 30:37.130]  All right, we'll quit kissing Hitman's ass
[30:37.130 --> 30:39.410]  for a couple of seconds and move on the show.
[30:39.410 --> 30:40.450]  Much love to the Hitman crew.
[30:40.450 --> 30:41.850]  You guys, if you want to sponsor the podcast,
[30:41.850 --> 30:42.690]  send me an email.
[30:42.690 --> 30:44.450]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[30:44.450 --> 30:45.810]  I would love to get your product on the show.
[30:45.810 --> 30:47.610]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[30:47.610 --> 30:48.530]  send that to me.
[30:48.530 --> 30:50.690]  I'll give it an honest review right here on the podcast.
[30:50.690 --> 30:52.010]  We'll open it up, we'll test it out,
[30:52.010 --> 30:53.370]  we'll see what it does, we'll talk about it.
[30:53.370 --> 30:55.150]  We'll post pictures to Instagram.
[30:55.150 --> 30:56.410]  Speaking of Instagram, you guys,
[30:56.410 --> 30:58.410]  make sure you follow the new Instagram.
[30:58.410 --> 31:01.570]  They took down the original one, about 19,000 followers.
[31:01.570 --> 31:03.850]  I'm back up to about 1,500 followers.
[31:03.850 --> 31:06.250]  I'm not working as hard at getting followers.
[31:06.250 --> 31:08.170]  I'm just posting pictures for fun this time.
[31:08.170 --> 31:10.210]  I post a lot of great cannabis pictures.
[31:10.210 --> 31:11.610]  You can go ahead and follow the new Instagram.
[31:11.610 --> 31:13.450]  It's at ireee underscore genetics.
[31:13.450 --> 31:15.470]  Ireee genetics with an underscore right in the middle there.
[31:15.470 --> 31:17.290]  Make sure you check that out.
[31:17.290 --> 31:18.930]  All right, I think that's what I've got for you this week.
[31:18.930 --> 31:20.010]  You guys, now that the show's over,
[31:20.010 --> 31:21.090]  make sure you go to iTunes.
[31:21.090 --> 31:22.170]  Go to the iTunes store,
[31:22.170 --> 31:23.690]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[31:23.690 --> 31:26.010]  find the review section, give me a five-star rating,
[31:26.010 --> 31:27.390]  and after that, type in a little comment.
[31:27.390 --> 31:29.250]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[31:29.250 --> 31:33.130]  And you guys, I will read your comment on a future episode.
[31:33.130 --> 31:34.450]  It's hard to leave comments on Stitcher,
[31:34.450 --> 31:36.130]  but if you leave one there and I see it,
[31:36.130 --> 31:37.650]  I will read your comment on the show,
[31:37.650 --> 31:40.110]  but Stitcher isn't as sufficient
[31:40.110 --> 31:41.750]  with the comments as iTunes.
