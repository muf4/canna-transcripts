[00:17.150 --> 00:19.790]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.790 --> 00:23.030]  It's time for episode number one 32 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.190 --> 00:27.270]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.270 --> 00:29.070]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.310 --> 00:31.270]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.590 --> 00:34.550]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.550 --> 00:38.110]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.950 --> 00:40.670]  I'm your host. My friends call me Roscoe Jeff.
[00:40.670 --> 00:43.150]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:43.230 --> 00:46.270]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:46.270 --> 00:48.190]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.590 --> 00:51.950]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:54.750 --> 00:56.350]  You guys mystic roots is on tour this spring.
[00:56.350 --> 00:57.870]  They're touring around with catch a fire.
[00:58.030 --> 01:00.270]  They're doing five or six shows in Colorado.
[01:00.270 --> 01:03.790]  I will be at the Colorado spring show at the black sheep for sure.
[01:04.110 --> 01:05.830]  There's a good chance I'll be at some of the Denver shows.
[01:05.830 --> 01:07.150]  I cannot commit to any of that right now,
[01:07.150 --> 01:09.030]  but I will definitely be at the show with the black sheep.
[01:09.550 --> 01:10.550]  Look forward to seeing you there.
[01:10.550 --> 01:12.390]  I look forward to seeing the mystic roots band there.
[01:12.710 --> 01:15.590]  Everybody stay positive and get down. All right.
[01:15.630 --> 01:18.030]  You guys are having a great week. I am having a wonderful week.
[01:18.030 --> 01:20.150]  It was hot as shit here today in Colorado.
[01:20.150 --> 01:22.190]  Today's the hottest day of the year that we've had so far.
[01:22.190 --> 01:24.070]  It hit 80 degrees in Colorado Springs.
[01:24.630 --> 01:26.950]  I was over 80 degrees today in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:27.270 --> 01:28.670]  I was the first day I got sweaty.
[01:28.670 --> 01:31.230]  It was the first day it actually got a little bit hot in the large grow.
[01:31.230 --> 01:32.870]  And I thought, hold a shit. It's warm in here.
[01:33.110 --> 01:34.430]  So we're off to a good start.
[01:34.430 --> 01:37.230]  It's time to start making those summer adjustments in your grow rooms.
[01:37.390 --> 01:39.430]  Start thinking about air conditioning and stuff like that.
[01:39.430 --> 01:42.910]  You guys, maybe we need to do an episode on doing the season switch.
[01:43.710 --> 01:45.110]  All right, let's do a,
[01:45.110 --> 01:46.790]  let's do some important announcements. You guys,
[01:47.150 --> 01:49.870]  the secret session is coming back to Denver on May 19th.
[01:49.870 --> 01:52.070]  The secret sesh brought to you by Gatsby gardens.
[01:52.270 --> 01:54.790]  If you want more information on the secret session, Denver, Colorado,
[01:54.790 --> 01:57.830]  on May 19th, all you have to do is follow at secret sesh,
[01:57.870 --> 02:02.070]  Colorado on Instagram. That's right. Secret sesh CEO on the Instagram. You guys,
[02:02.070 --> 02:05.550]  I cannot get you tickets. I cannot get you passes. I can't get you on the list.
[02:05.830 --> 02:07.110]  I cannot do anything to help you out.
[02:07.110 --> 02:11.350]  I am simply blessed to be at the event myself. I can't help you out.
[02:11.350 --> 02:14.110]  So all the people that asked me for help, all the people that sent me text messages,
[02:14.110 --> 02:17.830]  I apologize. I'm telling you right now, I can't do shit to get you into that event.
[02:17.870 --> 02:21.030]  So do what you gotta do. Get on the list, make your reservations, pay your dues.
[02:21.470 --> 02:23.390]  I'll see you there. I'll take some fat dabs with you.
[02:23.390 --> 02:25.270]  Shout out to the grimy Gatsby for throwing this event.
[02:25.510 --> 02:29.190]  Also a huge shout out to Adam ill for coming from California to host this event
[02:29.190 --> 02:32.430]  for us. Uh, much love, much respect to Adam ill without Adam ill.
[02:32.430 --> 02:34.310]  This podcast may not have happened. You guys,
[02:34.590 --> 02:38.510]  Adam ill kind of inspired me to do a show. Uh, he quit doing a podcast.
[02:38.510 --> 02:40.830]  I felt an absence. There were a couple of other podcasts that inspired,
[02:40.830 --> 02:44.710]  but Adam mill had a huge part. So big, big respect, much love to Adam ill.
[02:45.390 --> 02:45.790]  All right, you guys,
[02:45.790 --> 02:48.310]  I'm going to turn down this music here and we're going to talk a little bit
[02:48.310 --> 02:52.310]  about, uh, let's see. I've been growing in cocoa lately. I've made the switch.
[02:52.310 --> 02:55.390]  I ran a few pots at the big grow with nothing but cocoa in there.
[02:55.910 --> 02:57.670]  And I am really liking it. You guys,
[02:58.270 --> 03:00.470]  it seems like I'm watering a little bit more frequently,
[03:00.510 --> 03:04.350]  but one thing I've noticed is that I cannot overwater the plants that are in the
[03:04.350 --> 03:06.870]  cocoa. Um, I've been doing a couple of experiments.
[03:06.870 --> 03:10.310]  I've got one pot set aside from all the other pots. And when I water,
[03:10.550 --> 03:13.550]  I give this one pot double or triple what every other plant gets.
[03:13.830 --> 03:16.910]  And it does not ever show signs of stress from being overwatered.
[03:16.910 --> 03:18.550]  So that's something I like. Uh,
[03:18.590 --> 03:21.230]  there are some times when I know I'm not going to get back to the grow first
[03:21.230 --> 03:24.750]  thing in the morning. So I will just heavily, heavily water those plants.
[03:25.430 --> 03:26.910]  And I felt like when I was running soil,
[03:27.270 --> 03:30.350]  sometimes I would flood those plants so much that I could see them getting
[03:30.350 --> 03:34.230]  droopy and being angry from being overwatered. That never happens with the cocoa.
[03:34.230 --> 03:37.990]  So I'm able to flood these plants and they don't get pissed off from being
[03:38.030 --> 03:41.390]  overwatered. But it does feel like my regular watering schedule.
[03:41.590 --> 03:43.430]  I need to hit them a little bit more frequently.
[03:43.430 --> 03:45.990]  I've had to increase the amount of water that I give them because they are
[03:45.990 --> 03:50.230]  drying out a little bit more quickly. Uh, one thing I've noticed with cocoa,
[03:50.270 --> 03:53.630]  one thing I should mention with cocoa, there are no nutrients in cocoa.
[03:53.630 --> 03:56.190]  If you're just using straight cocoa, there's nothing there to keep your plant
[03:56.190 --> 03:59.590]  going. So you're going to need to feed it nutrients. Almost every watering,
[03:59.950 --> 04:04.310]  I've been giving it, uh, lots of nutrients and I do about, uh,
[04:04.630 --> 04:09.070]  so I water the plants twice a day. I'll do nutrients, nutrients,
[04:09.110 --> 04:11.030]  that's two waters in one day, nutrients, nutrients.
[04:11.030 --> 04:13.430]  The next day I'll go nutrients, nutrients, and then I'll go nutrients.
[04:13.790 --> 04:15.630]  And then the watering before I leave on the third day,
[04:15.630 --> 04:18.950]  I usually just hit them with clean water. So they're getting a lot of nutrients.
[04:18.950 --> 04:21.190]  They don't look, uh, I don't see any deficiencies.
[04:21.190 --> 04:23.230]  I don't see any over nutrients. Uh,
[04:23.230 --> 04:26.710]  they don't look mad from being overwatered. I'm really liking the cocoa.
[04:26.710 --> 04:29.110]  You guys, one thing I should mention, don't let your cocoa dry out.
[04:29.110 --> 04:31.350]  Once you see the top layer of cocoa drying out,
[04:31.830 --> 04:34.310]  that's when you're in danger of your plants getting a little bit too dry.
[04:34.310 --> 04:37.190]  It happens very quickly on cocoa. The timeframe,
[04:37.190 --> 04:39.950]  when you walk in to a soil grow and you see your plants drooping,
[04:40.190 --> 04:42.910]  they're kind of starting to get pissed off. If they're drooping in cocoa,
[04:42.950 --> 04:44.670]  they're fucking angry. That's one thing I've noticed.
[04:44.670 --> 04:47.270]  I've been doing some experiments and I'm learning so that you guys don't have to
[04:47.270 --> 04:50.150]  kill plants to learn. I've got more access. I've got more space.
[04:50.190 --> 04:53.750]  So we're learning with cocoa. I really do like it. Um,
[04:53.750 --> 04:56.910]  this kind of segues into something else I want to talk about. Um,
[04:57.950 --> 05:01.230]  over watering. I see a lot of people in a lot of grows over watering.
[05:01.270 --> 05:04.630]  Their plants and they're wondering why the growth of their plant is stunted.
[05:05.430 --> 05:09.190]  There's something that happens when the soil starts to dry out a little bit,
[05:09.190 --> 05:11.070]  or when your medium starts to dry out a bit,
[05:11.470 --> 05:16.070]  the moisture to oxygen ratio in there really makes your roots want to grow.
[05:16.350 --> 05:19.390]  It really makes your roots want to eat. So they start searching for nutrients.
[05:19.390 --> 05:23.230]  They start growing a little bit. This really makes your plants get active. Um,
[05:23.230 --> 05:25.830]  I I've noticed that when I used to run, uh,
[05:25.870 --> 05:28.110]  clones in root cubes or rock wool,
[05:28.110 --> 05:31.710]  I would notice that my clones would actually root the best when I would forget
[05:31.710 --> 05:35.150]  about them and the cloner and the rock will cube would dry up a little bit.
[05:35.630 --> 05:39.510]  I really think that that dryness is what the plants are looking for a little bit
[05:39.510 --> 05:42.750]  more than the wetness. They don't want to be soggy all the time.
[05:42.750 --> 05:47.270]  So it's kind of a good idea to give your plants a short dry out period.
[05:47.270 --> 05:50.670]  You don't want them getting wilty and crispy, but keep an eye on your plant,
[05:50.670 --> 05:53.590]  water your plants thoroughly, and then keep an eye on them and watch.
[05:53.630 --> 05:55.870]  You'll see right when they start to droop a little bit,
[05:55.890 --> 05:57.190]  that's when you need to give them water.
[05:57.190 --> 06:01.310]  So start learning right before that happens and then start feeding them right
[06:01.310 --> 06:02.950]  before that, right before they start to droop.
[06:02.950 --> 06:05.830]  That's when you should be given a water every time so that you allow that dry
[06:05.830 --> 06:07.070]  out phase. Uh,
[06:07.070 --> 06:09.630]  something that happens in that dry out phase that we've talked about on this
[06:09.630 --> 06:14.310]  podcast several episodes back as the moisture level in your root zone
[06:14.310 --> 06:17.910]  changes as the water level in your soil ball and your cocoa area,
[06:17.910 --> 06:21.150]  as that moisture level changes, so will the pH.
[06:21.470 --> 06:26.630]  So if you're feeding your plants a nutrient solution, that's real high in pH,
[06:26.630 --> 06:27.470]  you pour it in there.
[06:27.750 --> 06:30.950]  Only certain nutrients are going to be available at that pH level.
[06:31.350 --> 06:35.870]  But as the moisture level and temperature change inside of that soil ball,
[06:35.870 --> 06:39.110]  inside that rhizosphere, inside your pot and your container there,
[06:39.670 --> 06:43.750]  the pH will change and different nutrients will become bioavailable to your
[06:43.750 --> 06:47.710]  plants. So there are several advantages to letting your plants dry out just a
[06:47.710 --> 06:49.430]  little bit. I don't want you to let them get crispy,
[06:50.030 --> 06:52.270]  but it is good for your plants to dry out just a little bit.
[06:52.270 --> 06:55.630]  You'll see much more production. Uh, this is why, uh,
[06:55.630 --> 06:59.950]  I like to put my mother plants in root pots or air pots or earth pots,
[06:59.950 --> 07:03.430]  any type of fabric pot that they can breathe a whole bunch or they make those
[07:03.430 --> 07:06.350]  plastic pots that have a bunch of holes in them that have like the dimple shapes
[07:06.350 --> 07:09.310]  on them. I really like that. Uh,
[07:09.350 --> 07:11.630]  because I feel like your roots get a lot of oxygen.
[07:12.030 --> 07:13.670]  And then if you're using that and cocoa,
[07:13.710 --> 07:17.070]  your roots are going to be surrounded by oxygen and they're going to grow
[07:17.070 --> 07:18.990]  rapidly and your plants will love it.
[07:19.030 --> 07:23.470]  So that is my take on cocoa and kind of a segue into letting your plants dry
[07:23.470 --> 07:24.750]  out a little bit. I love cocoa.
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.950]  You got to use more nutrients. Uh,
[07:26.950 --> 07:30.790]  you definitely need more cow and more mag with cocoa, uh, more cow mag,
[07:31.350 --> 07:32.470]  heavily with cocoa.
[07:32.910 --> 07:36.270]  And then if you're using soil or cocoa or a soil,
[07:36.270 --> 07:40.030]  this makes us a good idea to kind of let your plants dry up just a little bit.
[07:40.030 --> 07:41.110]  All right. That was a quick talk,
[07:41.270 --> 07:44.990]  quick ramble about how I feel about cocoa and what I've learned about letting
[07:44.990 --> 07:48.830]  the plants dry a little bit. So, um, let's move into the next part.
[07:48.870 --> 07:51.430]  I want to talk about collecting pollen. You guys, yesterday,
[07:51.430 --> 07:54.670]  I spent a couple of hours, uh, working with a male plant.
[07:54.670 --> 07:56.110]  If you've been following my social media,
[07:56.110 --> 07:59.790]  you know that I've got an arise male from arise F1 seed.
[07:59.790 --> 08:02.590]  He is a male plant that looks like a true stud. He plans.
[08:02.910 --> 08:04.910]  I plan on using him as my breeding stud.
[08:05.670 --> 08:09.630]  I took him to about eight weeks of flower and a flowering room to see what he
[08:09.650 --> 08:13.030]  would do. And yesterday I cut him down. But before I did, I collected the pollen.
[08:13.790 --> 08:17.470]  Now here is how I collected the palm. There are several methods to doing this.
[08:17.470 --> 08:20.830]  I actually used a couple of different techniques to see what I liked better, uh,
[08:20.830 --> 08:24.110]  just cause I wanted to talk about it on the show. The way I started, you guys,
[08:24.110 --> 08:27.750]  I was holding a Mason jar and I was just going to the bottom buds and I grabbed
[08:27.750 --> 08:30.670]  a drumstick cause I'm a drummer and grabbed a drumstick and I was just tapping
[08:30.710 --> 08:35.710]  the male buds over the jar and pollen was falling into the jar and I liked it.
[08:36.150 --> 08:36.750]  It was working,
[08:36.750 --> 08:39.630]  but I felt that a bunch of the pollen was missing the jars.
[08:39.630 --> 08:42.910]  I was tapping the bud pollen was falling down the side of the jar.
[08:42.910 --> 08:44.830]  Pollen was falling on my hand. Uh,
[08:44.870 --> 08:46.910]  the side of the bud that didn't have a jar near it.
[08:46.910 --> 08:48.590]  There was just pollen falling onto the floor.
[08:49.110 --> 08:51.710]  There was plenty of pollen collected, but I felt like I was wasting a lot.
[08:51.710 --> 08:54.750]  So I had this jar and I'm just tapping buds and I'm tapping the buds,
[08:54.750 --> 08:57.190]  the pollen into the jar. I got a lot. Um,
[08:57.190 --> 09:01.830]  the next method that I tried was I cut the buds off of the plant and I just laid
[09:01.830 --> 09:03.150]  the male flowers,
[09:03.150 --> 09:08.150]  the buds with the male flowers onto a glass tray and then I was just tapping
[09:08.870 --> 09:12.910]  them with my finger and what I was noticing was a bunch more pollen was falling
[09:12.910 --> 09:15.950]  off and landing directly onto the tray and I wasn't losing as much.
[09:15.950 --> 09:19.990]  The only problem there was I was gathering a whole bunch of male flowers.
[09:20.390 --> 09:24.750]  So what I had to do was sift out the male flowers from the pollen because you
[09:24.750 --> 09:26.190]  don't want to leave those male flowers in there.
[09:26.190 --> 09:27.950]  If you store it with those male flowers in there,
[09:27.950 --> 09:31.990]  there is a chance that those male flowers have moisture in them and they will
[09:31.990 --> 09:35.750]  mildew up inside of your jar and moisture is one of your biggest enemies to
[09:35.750 --> 09:37.710]  pollen. We're going to talk about that here in just a minute.
[09:38.390 --> 09:41.630]  So what I found to be the most successful was taking the, the chopping,
[09:41.630 --> 09:42.470]  the tops,
[09:42.470 --> 09:45.750]  just chop the top right off the male plant and I set it on a glass tray and just
[09:45.750 --> 09:47.990]  tapped it and I just tapped it for a couple of good minutes.
[09:48.030 --> 09:51.630]  I was tapping it kind of hard and then I could just see the pollen falling out of
[09:51.630 --> 09:54.990]  the buds and then I turned it over and did it again and then I picked it up and
[09:54.990 --> 09:57.630]  kind of tapped it with my finger to knock off any pollen that's stuck and then
[09:57.630 --> 10:01.070]  I just threw that big old pollen. What did I do?
[10:01.070 --> 10:04.430]  Just pollen removed bud just threw that part right into the trash.
[10:05.110 --> 10:08.910]  So I felt that setting it on the tray and tapping it was my best method for
[10:08.910 --> 10:12.390]  collecting pollen. However, I did get all those male plants. So I just used,
[10:12.990 --> 10:13.910]  I felt kind of sketchy,
[10:13.910 --> 10:18.910]  but I just use an old ID on a plate and just separated the male flowers from the
[10:18.990 --> 10:19.830]  pollen.
[10:20.110 --> 10:23.190]  It kind of felt like a cross between when you used to pick seeds out of swag
[10:23.190 --> 10:26.150]  weed and also when you used to use a credit card to do bad drugs,
[10:26.150 --> 10:29.750]  it's kind of what it felt like. So I was a weird feeling, but it was definitely,
[10:30.150 --> 10:31.550]  uh, it worked. It worked very well.
[10:31.550 --> 10:35.950]  So I've got a Mason jar with a nice like two inch layer of a rise pollen in the
[10:35.970 --> 10:38.830]  bottom of it. And I do plan on making some crosses with the rise.
[10:38.830 --> 10:42.430]  And I also plan on making an arise F two in the future here.
[10:42.430 --> 10:46.030]  So look out for some seeds coming up from iRegenetics in the very near future.
[10:46.030 --> 10:46.950]  I'll need some testers.
[10:47.030 --> 10:49.310]  I need you guys to run those for me and tell me what they do.
[10:50.710 --> 10:52.870]  Now I'm going to get a bunch of messages from people that want to be testers.
[10:52.950 --> 10:55.710]  That's cool. I can deal with that. I'm very selective on testers, you guys.
[10:55.710 --> 10:57.070]  So when it comes time to test seeds,
[10:57.190 --> 11:00.150]  you need to have an impressive resume if you want to be a tester for me,
[11:00.150 --> 11:02.190]  because I need to know what's truly going on with these plants.
[11:02.190 --> 11:06.190]  I need reliable testers. When the time comes, I will talk about that on the show.
[11:06.190 --> 11:08.270]  It's not time for testers yet. All right.
[11:08.270 --> 11:11.030]  Another method that I was using to try to collect the pollen that I didn't find
[11:11.030 --> 11:14.110]  to be very successful was I was cutting the branch off that had the male flowers
[11:14.110 --> 11:17.670]  on it and just cutting it into six or eight inch sections and holding,
[11:18.030 --> 11:21.310]  actually kind of dipping that into a Mason jar and then tapping it at the base
[11:21.310 --> 11:22.990]  of the stock. And it was working,
[11:22.990 --> 11:25.990]  but I was not able to knock off enough pollen to make it worth my time.
[11:26.270 --> 11:29.230]  And it was also knocking off a bunch of male flowers into the Mason jar,
[11:29.230 --> 11:32.270]  which meant that I had to pour that back out onto the plate anyway to sift it.
[11:32.630 --> 11:35.510]  So it wasn't really, I didn't find it to be effective.
[11:35.510 --> 11:38.430]  So I think the best method was to put,
[11:38.630 --> 11:42.110]  if you've got a giant mirror or if you're a drummer and you've got an old kick
[11:42.110 --> 11:43.830]  drum head, just drop a nug,
[11:44.110 --> 11:46.990]  the male plant right down onto the giant mirror and just tap on it.
[11:46.990 --> 11:50.430]  And then all the pollen will fall off and then use a credit card or an old ID
[11:50.430 --> 11:52.870]  just to scrape it up. It's easy to collect pollen.
[11:52.870 --> 11:56.070]  So once you've got your pollen, you're going to need to store your pollen.
[11:56.230 --> 11:57.910]  I recommend putting it in a Mason jar.
[11:58.150 --> 12:01.430]  And then I like to put that Mason jar in a brown paper bag to keep it dark.
[12:01.750 --> 12:04.710]  And then I put all of that inside of the refrigerator, uh,
[12:04.750 --> 12:08.110]  carefully label your jars of pollen. You guys, that's really important.
[12:08.110 --> 12:12.230]  My jar says a rise F one pollen collected five, five,
[12:12.230 --> 12:15.510]  16 that's easy enough. I know that that's a rise pollen.
[12:15.550 --> 12:17.390]  And I know when it was collected. Uh,
[12:17.430 --> 12:19.750]  I've never really tried to store pollen for too long.
[12:19.750 --> 12:24.150]  I always use it kind of soon. I could imagine it would last a few months,
[12:24.190 --> 12:28.670]  maybe, but I'm honestly not sure if it's properly stored six months,
[12:28.670 --> 12:31.150]  maybe a year. I don't want to lie to you. Uh,
[12:31.150 --> 12:32.430]  if you've got information on how long,
[12:32.430 --> 12:36.430]  if you've had pollen stored for a long time and you used it and it worked, uh,
[12:36.430 --> 12:38.670]  send me an email, grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[12:38.710 --> 12:42.990]  I want to hear your pollen methods on how long and how you apply pollen.
[12:42.990 --> 12:44.750]  I want to know how long you keep it before you apply it.
[12:45.230 --> 12:48.510]  And what the oldest viable pollen you ever had was. That's what I want to know.
[12:49.390 --> 12:52.270]  All right. So you've collected a bunch of pollen. You've got it in a Mason jar.
[12:52.470 --> 12:54.910]  It's well-labeled. It's been stored in the fridge for a little bit.
[12:54.910 --> 12:56.190]  Here's something I must mention.
[12:56.710 --> 12:59.710]  Do not get your pollen wet in any way, shape or form.
[13:00.150 --> 13:04.350]  Moisture is pollen's worst enemy. A lot of people ask me, they're like, bro,
[13:04.350 --> 13:07.590]  you breed and you grow seedless flowers in the same facility.
[13:08.030 --> 13:11.790]  Aren't you scared having that male flower around or that male plant around?
[13:11.830 --> 13:12.910]  That's just spitting pollen.
[13:12.910 --> 13:16.350]  Aren't you worried about seating up all of your females? Um,
[13:16.750 --> 13:18.870]  sometimes shit happens. Yes.
[13:19.150 --> 13:22.110]  Sometimes I've grown crops that were meant to be seedless and I've accidentally
[13:22.110 --> 13:23.710]  discovered a whole bunch of seeds in there.
[13:23.950 --> 13:26.750]  And it was because it had a male plant in the same area and it just got
[13:26.770 --> 13:31.950]  cross-pollinated. But the secret is water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[13:32.430 --> 13:37.270]  So I've got two separate areas. One's got a male plant. One's got female plants.
[13:37.270 --> 13:40.830]  The female plants are in flower and completely able to accept pollen.
[13:41.070 --> 13:43.670]  They're still in their ovulation phase. They can accept pollen.
[13:43.670 --> 13:46.710]  They can make seeds. They can become seeded. They can,
[13:46.710 --> 13:50.510]  they're going to grow long enough to make viable seed the way that I prevent
[13:50.510 --> 13:52.630]  them from being seeded when I mess with my male plant.
[13:52.630 --> 13:56.990]  So yesterday I was playing with a male plant about 30 feet away from those
[13:57.010 --> 14:00.110]  female plants. What I did was I took a, uh,
[14:00.110 --> 14:03.310]  like my backpack sprayer that I would apply pesticides or foliar feed in there.
[14:03.390 --> 14:05.790]  I just mixed up some water in there, just straight clean water.
[14:05.830 --> 14:09.990]  I pH it at 6.5 and I sprayed that all over my female plants.
[14:10.390 --> 14:13.030]  And then I went and I played with my male plant in a separate area.
[14:13.350 --> 14:16.030]  I collected all the pollen from him. Then I cleaned up,
[14:16.390 --> 14:19.630]  I threw away all the trash and I threw away the pot. I threw away, not the pot,
[14:19.630 --> 14:23.030]  but like the container. I threw away the container. I threw away all the dirt.
[14:23.050 --> 14:26.030]  I cleaned up, I swept up that room. I cleaned up the room where the male was.
[14:26.630 --> 14:29.790]  Then I took the clothes that I was wearing and I walked straight to a washing
[14:29.830 --> 14:33.150]  machine. I took the clothes off and threw them into a washing machine.
[14:33.630 --> 14:37.510]  Then I walked myself directly to a shower and I hosed myself down,
[14:37.530 --> 14:39.310]  including you guys.
[14:39.330 --> 14:43.590]  I am six foot five and I have got dreadlocks almost to my knees. My,
[14:43.590 --> 14:47.870]  my dreadlocks are mid thigh region and I had to run to a shower and just rinse my
[14:47.870 --> 14:50.710]  whole self down. So I had to go wash the dreads. I had to go wash the beard.
[14:50.990 --> 14:52.150]  Just went and scrub myself.
[14:52.910 --> 14:57.910]  I feel that the water I applied to those female plants made them unable.
[14:58.030 --> 15:01.070]  It was a little bit of birth control. It made them unable to collect pollen.
[15:01.270 --> 15:05.030]  The pollen was not allowed to land on the pistol and move into the ovule because
[15:05.050 --> 15:06.190]  the water was in the way.
[15:06.670 --> 15:10.350]  I also feel that any water or any pollen that was on myself or my clothes was
[15:10.350 --> 15:11.990]  destroyed as soon as it hit the water.
[15:12.430 --> 15:14.350]  I carried those clothes up to the washing machine.
[15:14.350 --> 15:16.270]  I threw them in the washing machine, turn on the water.
[15:16.990 --> 15:19.630]  Even the hat that I was wearing got thrown into that washing machine.
[15:19.630 --> 15:21.910]  So all the clothes got washed and the hat got washed.
[15:22.110 --> 15:24.350]  Then the dreadlocks got washed. I got washed.
[15:25.070 --> 15:28.910]  And then before I went back into the grow room with the females,
[15:28.910 --> 15:32.870]  I went and grabbed my sprayer again and I sprayed it in front of me as I walked
[15:32.870 --> 15:33.590]  into that room.
[15:33.590 --> 15:37.350]  So there was water landing on those plants before I got into there is kind of
[15:37.370 --> 15:41.590]  what I was aiming for. I'm pretty sure that these plants will not be seeded.
[15:41.610 --> 15:44.510]  The female plants that I was messing with. And yesterday,
[15:44.510 --> 15:47.190]  after I played with my male plant, I went and took pictures of the girls.
[15:47.510 --> 15:52.070]  I am 99% sure that I did not seed them. It's all about water. You guys,
[15:52.630 --> 15:56.910]  uh, I have seen people set up a screen, like a screen door.
[15:56.910 --> 15:59.710]  So you open up your grow room door and then there's a screen door and they've
[15:59.730 --> 16:01.870]  got water running down that screen door.
[16:02.190 --> 16:05.390]  There's a little Mr. Spring water right at the top and it collects on the screen
[16:05.390 --> 16:07.790]  and runs down. That is their pollen catch.
[16:07.910 --> 16:11.910]  They also sell a UV light that will kill pollen that goes in your ducting.
[16:11.910 --> 16:14.230]  So if pollen comes in,
[16:14.230 --> 16:16.750]  it goes through this UV light that goes through your ducting and then it is
[16:16.770 --> 16:18.350]  just killed right there. It's neutralized.
[16:18.750 --> 16:22.270]  So pollen isn't as scary as a lot of people like to think water will destroy
[16:22.270 --> 16:24.950]  pollen. If you were afraid of pollinating your plants,
[16:24.950 --> 16:28.430]  just apply a little bit of water and you should be safe. All right.
[16:28.450 --> 16:31.670]  If you guys are playing with pollen and female plants and male plants in a,
[16:31.990 --> 16:35.510]  in a small area, in a house, in a home grow the first couple of times,
[16:35.590 --> 16:37.030]  expect to get some seeds.
[16:37.390 --> 16:41.310]  It takes one little tiny speck of pollen to make a seed and pollen is so tiny.
[16:41.330 --> 16:44.350]  You can't get it all off of you unless you kind of have some experience and you
[16:44.370 --> 16:45.110]  know what you're doing.
[16:45.110 --> 16:48.630]  So don't be surprised if you pollinate your crop on accident,
[16:48.630 --> 16:51.750]  you guys have been going for 17 minutes now and you can hear the dryness in my
[16:51.750 --> 16:55.070]  throat. So I'm gonna take a quick drink and a couple of dabs and I will be right
[16:55.070 --> 16:58.830]  back. All right, I am back.
[16:58.850 --> 17:00.950]  I'm well hydrated and well medicated.
[17:01.110 --> 17:03.270]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Turpex.
[17:03.430 --> 17:05.190]  Big shout out to the whole Turpex crew right now.
[17:05.190 --> 17:07.830]  I am dabbing some cactus cookies cream.
[17:08.190 --> 17:11.110]  A shatter made by the friends at Turpex and this stuff tastes delicious.
[17:11.110 --> 17:14.770]  Great work you guys. Also props to the grower, whoever grew this, it was not me.
[17:14.770 --> 17:18.170]  I'm not bragging. Whoever did the growing here, they did a really nice job.
[17:18.170 --> 17:21.410]  So great work, great concentrates. You can always pick up your Turpex shatter,
[17:21.650 --> 17:25.130]  your Turpex live resin, your Turpex waxes, your Turpex butters.
[17:25.130 --> 17:28.570]  You can get your Turpex products at green and healthy wellness at 430 West
[17:28.570 --> 17:31.490]  Colorado and Colorado Springs. Make sure you check that out.
[17:31.570 --> 17:32.810]  It is a medical only facility.
[17:32.810 --> 17:37.130]  So you do need your medical marijuana recommendation to shop there. All right.
[17:37.130 --> 17:39.730]  Many of you may know that I am a consultant. I do consulting.
[17:39.730 --> 17:43.410]  I help people build grow rooms. I help them get their grow rooms going. Uh,
[17:43.410 --> 17:46.450]  if you have a problem in your grow, you can contact me, pay me a small fee.
[17:46.450 --> 17:49.690]  I will come to your garden and check out your grow and tell you what's going on
[17:49.690 --> 17:52.610]  and tell you what's wrong and help you correct and improve your grow.
[17:53.090 --> 17:57.010]  So recently I was called to a place where this guy had powdery mildew and he
[17:57.010 --> 18:00.170]  could not figure out what was causing the powdery mildew. Uh,
[18:00.170 --> 18:03.970]  the problem was that he was not getting rid of his old stale air.
[18:04.250 --> 18:05.290]  I talk about this a lot.
[18:05.290 --> 18:08.210]  You need to remove the stagnant air from your grow room.
[18:08.210 --> 18:09.770]  You need to get rid of that extra humidity.
[18:09.770 --> 18:11.130]  You need to get rid of that old moisture.
[18:11.130 --> 18:13.290]  You need to get it out of the room and get some fresh air in there.
[18:13.810 --> 18:17.370]  This guy is failing to do that in his area and he is getting powdery mildew.
[18:17.810 --> 18:20.370]  We've tried a few things to get rid of the powdery mildew.
[18:21.010 --> 18:23.490]  We've applied a couple of products that seem to be working,
[18:23.650 --> 18:27.450]  but unfortunately he had to harvest a little bit early because the PM was
[18:27.450 --> 18:29.250]  overtaking a couple of plants.
[18:29.850 --> 18:32.930]  So let me tell you a little bit about what we tried to get rid of this powdery
[18:32.930 --> 18:36.130]  mildew. A while back when I first discovered the powdery mildew in this guy's
[18:36.130 --> 18:40.810]  garden, I started applying a product called stylet oil. It's JMS stylet oil.
[18:41.130 --> 18:45.050]  It seemed to be working very well. It was knocking the PM off of the leaves.
[18:45.130 --> 18:48.010]  We couldn't see any on there. It wouldn't come back for quite some time,
[18:48.330 --> 18:51.490]  but we had to keep spraying it about once a week to keep the PM away.
[18:51.930 --> 18:54.890]  And I really didn't want to spray this stuff on heavy,
[18:54.890 --> 18:57.930]  chunky buds because I could tell it was leaving a little bit of an oil on the
[18:57.930 --> 19:01.250]  plants, which was actually the main ingredient that was stopping the PM.
[19:01.530 --> 19:04.770]  I just didn't want to put this oil all over his buds. So I didn't like spraying it.
[19:05.290 --> 19:09.690]  I researched another product and I was recommended big time exterminator.
[19:10.010 --> 19:15.010]  Big time exterminator is 90 or is mostly a citric acid or citric oil.
[19:15.010 --> 19:16.770]  I don't remember which one it is. I think a citric acid.
[19:17.250 --> 19:20.290]  And it works very well at keeping insects away.
[19:20.290 --> 19:21.890]  It makes the plants look really good.
[19:22.170 --> 19:25.690]  And it also took the powdery mildew off of the plants. Unfortunately,
[19:25.690 --> 19:29.050]  this product only works to keep the powdery mildew at bay for about three to
[19:29.050 --> 19:32.170]  five days at a time before we would start seeing little speckles pop up.
[19:33.050 --> 19:36.730]  It was getting closer to harvest and I wanted to try something a little bit more
[19:37.450 --> 19:40.730]  extreme. We were ready to go extreme. We did not want to use Eagle 20.
[19:41.210 --> 19:45.530]  I am trying to only use products that are allowed by the MED in my personal grow
[19:45.530 --> 19:49.290]  and in my caregiver grows and in my consultant grows just because it's easier to
[19:49.290 --> 19:52.450]  have one playing field. So we will not use Eagle 20 in this garden.
[19:53.370 --> 19:58.370]  What I did use was I got 30% hydrogen peroxide and I filled up a four gallon
[19:58.890 --> 20:03.890]  pump sprayer and I put a 20 milliliters per gallon of 30% hydrogen peroxide in
[20:04.890 --> 20:09.290]  this water and I adjusted the pH and I soaked all of the plants with this
[20:09.290 --> 20:14.210]  hydrogen peroxide solution and it took off most of the powdery mildew and it did
[20:14.210 --> 20:15.050]  not come back.
[20:15.370 --> 20:18.730]  Unfortunately there was one plant in the back corner where the powdery mildew had
[20:18.730 --> 20:21.410]  kind of taken over and I didn't see it was so bad back there.
[20:21.410 --> 20:25.250]  I didn't spray enough. It did not take off the powdery mildew on one plant.
[20:25.730 --> 20:29.810]  So my friend harvested most of his plants didn't show signs of powdery mildew.
[20:29.850 --> 20:34.050]  This one plant that did have powdery mildew, I found a solution online.
[20:34.050 --> 20:36.290]  My friend Jorge Cervantes taught us about this.
[20:36.650 --> 20:41.170]  I took a five gallon bucket and I put 50 milliliters of the 30% hydrogen
[20:41.170 --> 20:43.890]  peroxide in the bucket. You guys, whenever you're at, let me,
[20:43.930 --> 20:45.090]  let me back up a little bit.
[20:45.090 --> 20:47.330]  Whenever you were messing with this hydrogen peroxide,
[20:47.330 --> 20:51.290]  be sure to wear rubber gloves. You need some latex gloves.
[20:51.290 --> 20:53.570]  You don't want to get this stuff on your fingers. It'll burn your fingers.
[20:54.050 --> 20:57.170]  Depending on what kind of skin you've got, it could mess up your fingers.
[20:57.170 --> 20:59.850]  I'm a white guy. Uh, I dribbled some on my fingers.
[20:59.930 --> 21:02.410]  It made my fingers look bleached white. Uh,
[21:02.410 --> 21:04.970]  I imagine if you don't have a working hands,
[21:04.970 --> 21:06.690]  if you've got some softer, more gentle hands,
[21:06.730 --> 21:08.690]  it probably could burn your skin pretty well.
[21:08.690 --> 21:11.770]  So make sure you wear gloves when you're using the hydrogen peroxide.
[21:12.250 --> 21:15.410]  So mix your 50 mils of hydrogen peroxide into five,
[21:15.490 --> 21:18.810]  a five gallon bucket of water. And you guys, this may sound crazy,
[21:18.930 --> 21:22.770]  but I chopped the buds off of this plant and I was dunking them directly into
[21:22.790 --> 21:26.130]  the water and swishing them around for about five to seven seconds.
[21:26.130 --> 21:29.410]  Just swishing it under the water with the peroxide in there. Let me back up.
[21:29.730 --> 21:32.890]  I would cut off most of the leaf. You guys, most of the larger leaf,
[21:32.890 --> 21:33.970]  I'd give it a little pre trim.
[21:34.290 --> 21:36.570]  And then I would dunk the bud into the hydrogen peroxide.
[21:36.570 --> 21:39.250]  And then I was hanging it on a line with a flat fan,
[21:39.530 --> 21:43.330]  an oscillating fan blowing near it constantly to dry these buds out as quickly,
[21:43.650 --> 21:46.450]  not dry them, but to get them water out of them as quickly as possible.
[21:46.770 --> 21:49.890]  I left the fan on there for two to three hours. And then toward the end of the
[21:49.890 --> 21:50.210]  day,
[21:50.210 --> 21:52.730]  I just turned the fan to where it wasn't blowing directly on them.
[21:52.810 --> 21:54.290]  And I gave all the buds a squeeze.
[21:54.650 --> 21:58.490]  I cannot tell the difference between the buds that I dunked in the solution and
[21:58.490 --> 22:02.090]  the buds that were not dunked. The best part is the buds I dunked,
[22:02.250 --> 22:04.570]  shows zero signs of powdery mildew.
[22:05.650 --> 22:07.410]  I don't know if this is something you want to try at home.
[22:07.410 --> 22:10.810]  This is not something I would do in my garden, but I saw it work you guys.
[22:11.530 --> 22:13.890]  And when I smoke this product, it's not ready to smoke yet.
[22:13.890 --> 22:15.050]  It'll be ready in a couple of days.
[22:15.450 --> 22:20.130]  I am 90% sure that I'm not going to notice any of the peroxide solution in these
[22:20.150 --> 22:23.330]  flowers. So it may sound completely crazy,
[22:23.850 --> 22:26.410]  but if you've got a plant that's got to be harvested and it's got a little bit
[22:26.410 --> 22:30.050]  of powdery mildew on it, the best solution is to get a five gallon bucket,
[22:30.290 --> 22:33.530]  some water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide and go ahead and dunk those
[22:33.530 --> 22:36.690]  buds in there. Leave them in there for five or six seconds, pull them out,
[22:36.850 --> 22:40.370]  hang them up, put a fan on them and try to start getting them dry safely.
[22:40.650 --> 22:43.850]  And then from once they get dried out from that water, you just put in there,
[22:43.930 --> 22:45.490]  you're just drying them just like normal.
[22:45.490 --> 22:48.890]  You would dry and cure them just like any other flowers that you've cut down.
[22:48.890 --> 22:51.890]  So I hope that helps save your crop. The most important part, you guys,
[22:51.890 --> 22:55.090]  if you're getting powdery mildew, you need to correct the issue in your grow room.
[22:55.090 --> 22:57.170]  Something is causing that powdery mildew to happen.
[22:57.690 --> 22:59.610]  You are not getting enough airflow in there.
[22:59.890 --> 23:03.810]  I highly recommend heavily defoliating your plants, take off all the extra leaf.
[23:03.830 --> 23:07.610]  That will prevent PM. There will be less surface area for the PM to build up on.
[23:07.970 --> 23:10.290]  If you've got two leaves that are on top of each other,
[23:10.290 --> 23:11.810]  one leaf lays on top of another,
[23:12.130 --> 23:15.490]  and you get that little water layer underneath there that will eventually turn
[23:15.490 --> 23:18.650]  into powdery mildew. Uh, your plants are sweating on top of each other.
[23:18.890 --> 23:22.210]  And that sweaty space is the perfect environment to create some PM.
[23:23.050 --> 23:25.130]  Also another thing that we are experimenting with,
[23:25.170 --> 23:26.930]  I need to get with my friend that's got this product,
[23:26.930 --> 23:29.890]  but he recently bought the clean light. What the clean light is.
[23:29.890 --> 23:34.410]  It is a UV light that is designed for the strawberry industry and the pumpkin
[23:34.410 --> 23:38.650]  industry because strawberries and pumpkins apparently get powdery mildew very
[23:38.650 --> 23:39.050]  heavily.
[23:39.050 --> 23:42.610]  So they take this light and they hold it three to four inches above the plants
[23:42.610 --> 23:44.690]  and they just move this ultraviolet light around.
[23:44.690 --> 23:47.570]  And this light supposedly kills powdery mildew.
[23:47.850 --> 23:50.050]  My friend just got it. He's only used it a few times.
[23:50.050 --> 23:53.210]  They say it takes about a week of constant use of consistent use to get rid of
[23:53.210 --> 23:54.050]  the PM.
[23:54.210 --> 23:57.650]  But I will check with him in a few days and we will see if this has cured his
[23:57.650 --> 24:01.570]  powdery mildew problem. Hey guys, since I'm talking about PM, uh,
[24:01.570 --> 24:02.570]  I have a theory.
[24:02.770 --> 24:07.490]  I feel like CBD rich plants seem to be more susceptible to powdery mildew.
[24:08.250 --> 24:11.450]  I think there's something in the THC that gives it resistance to PM.
[24:11.930 --> 24:14.370]  And I do plan on talking to Fox a little bit more about this.
[24:14.370 --> 24:18.530]  So the next time I have Fox on that will definitely be one of my topics.
[24:19.010 --> 24:21.450]  So Fox, we got to get you on the show soon, bro. Also, uh,
[24:21.490 --> 24:24.370]  the guys from the Colorado podcast, this is the second time I told you,
[24:24.370 --> 24:25.210]  we got to get you on the show.
[24:25.690 --> 24:29.170]  We got to get Jesse and his crew back in here to do another outdoor grow lesson

[27:39.220 --> 27:42.340]  When will I ever learn?

[28:49.020 --> 28:51.620]  Wondering when it's my time.
