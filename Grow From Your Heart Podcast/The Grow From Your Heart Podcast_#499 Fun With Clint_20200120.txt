[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  So what the fuck word was it? He kept putting an H after the W. I can't remember it was
[00:04.800 --> 00:07.040]  like whip or something like fucking Stewie was doing.
[00:07.040 --> 00:08.040]  Yeah, dude, I have no idea.
[00:08.040 --> 00:09.040]  That was driving me crazy.
[00:09.040 --> 00:13.720]  But there was no, the problem was is there wasn't like a natural H sound in that word
[00:13.720 --> 00:14.720]  anyway.
[00:14.720 --> 00:18.400]  So do you think he did that as a comedian to get our attention to make sure we're listening
[00:18.400 --> 00:20.400]  because it bugs you and now you're paying attention?
[00:20.400 --> 00:21.880]  Or if he was testing us.
[00:21.880 --> 00:25.480]  Is that just how he says whatever word he was trying to say?
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.960]  It was his first time. It could be a couple of both, really. I mean, I'd like to know
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.240]  what that thought experiment of like, well, I heard other people in the crowd go, yeah,
[00:35.240 --> 00:37.880]  I can't remember the word right now, but it was a WH word.
[00:37.880 --> 00:39.440]  Like what or where or whip.
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.640]  It wasn't a double, but there was no H in that. I think it was a three letter word.
[00:43.640 --> 00:47.280]  Okay. It was like W I P whip.
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.280]  Yeah.
[00:48.280 --> 00:49.280]  Yeah.
[00:49.280 --> 00:52.480]  I don't know. That would have an H in it.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.480]  Okay. So nevermind.
[00:53.480 --> 00:54.480]  That's a great spot to start.
[00:54.480 --> 00:58.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. It is time for episode 499 of the Grow From Your
[00:58.120 --> 01:01.760]  Heart podcast. Obviously, Clint is back. He's sitting across the table from me with
[01:01.760 --> 01:04.200]  the great big smile. Bro, your beard looks fucking marvelous.
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.720]  Hey, thanks, buddy. I'm excited to show everybody at the IndoExpo.
[01:07.720 --> 01:12.680]  Oh man, that is a great segue. The IndoExpo, January 25th and 26th. I think this is a Monday
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.480]  show. So that is this weekend. If you're not prepared for that, get prepared for the IndoExpo
[01:17.480 --> 01:18.960]  coming soon.
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.040]  So hello everybody. How are you guys doing? I hope everybody's doing good. This is episode
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.040]  499.
[01:25.040 --> 01:28.960]  That was pretty good unison there. Yeah.
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.480]  We're getting it. We're doing pretty good.
[01:30.480 --> 01:33.560]  It only took 499 episodes to learn how to do this.
[01:33.560 --> 01:38.640]  You know, it's just, uh, you gotta be professional about some things. So.
[01:38.640 --> 01:39.640]  Some things.
[01:39.640 --> 01:40.640]  Some things.
[01:40.640 --> 01:41.640]  Not the podcast, but some things.
[01:41.640 --> 01:42.640]  Why would we do that?
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.240]  Uh, let's talk about professional. This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends
[01:45.240 --> 01:51.120]  at Seeds Here Now. If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds, I highly
[01:51.120 --> 02:01.800]  recommend our good friends at Seeds Here Now. And of course you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[02:01.800 --> 02:05.720]  Also we like to start the show off by talking about what we're smoking. Uh, do you know
[02:05.720 --> 02:07.320]  what's in your bowl today, bro?
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.040]  Oh, today I am smoking gelato.
[02:10.040 --> 02:13.120]  Gelato. Nice. I wasn't sure if I should ask, cause I don't even know if you would know
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.560]  what you had today. Oh, that's a big fat nugget of gelato. Nice work.
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.040]  Well, there used to be four big fat nuggets of gelato and then I got ahold of them. So
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.040]  that was fun.
[02:22.040 --> 02:25.560]  Look at you smoking all the gelato. Good herb dude. Is that what you smoked yesterday?
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.560]  Yes.
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.080]  It smelled good. I smelled some of that yesterday. It smelled nice.
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.720]  Yeah. Yesterday, Jeff and I were hanging. We went to a comedy show. It was really fun.
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.120]  Yes, we did. We will, we will get to the comedy show. That's going to be the main topic of
[02:36.120 --> 02:42.120]  the show. So that'll be a lot of this podcast. Um, I am dabbing on a product called honey
[02:42.120 --> 02:48.280]  banana live batter for my friends at green dot labs. This is a blend of banana OG and
[02:48.280 --> 02:54.040]  honey boo boo on the package. The flavor is described as frosted banana pastry. I'm cracking
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.840]  the jar open now and it smells like I get the frosted banana pastry, but I get more
[02:59.840 --> 03:04.640]  of a banana runs sort of a thing myself. Clint's going to give it a smell.
[03:04.640 --> 03:05.640]  Still nothing.
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.480]  Still nothing. Clint doesn't have much of a nose for the cannabis flavors and aromas.
[03:09.480 --> 03:12.760]  That's all right though. And I watched him eat some Parmesan French fries yesterday.
[03:12.760 --> 03:17.680]  So I know his taste buds are fucking ruined. Yeah, I don't really, uh, those were good
[03:17.680 --> 03:20.640]  for like four or five fries. But after the fourth or fifth one, I was like, man, that's
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.880]  a lot of salty Parmesan and Clint just fucking murdered him. So those taste buds are absolutely
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.680]  fucking ruined. But, uh, that's true. This, this honey banana smells and tastes amazing.
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.980]  I got this big four gram jar. And as soon as you open this, the entire room just gets
[03:34.980 --> 03:39.220]  this sweet banana candy smell. In my opinion, it's really potent. I don't have to hold it
[03:39.960 --> 03:42.860]  up to my face to smell it. I've got it down here by the computer and I can smell it nice
[03:42.860 --> 03:48.940]  and sweet. I really love the honey banana. The nice young bud tenderists. I don't know
[03:48.940 --> 03:52.980]  if that's even a word. That's a fun one. The great bud tender at the dispensary where I
[03:52.980 --> 03:56.500]  shop. She was like, I really hope you got that honey banana. Cause she came out of the
[03:56.500 --> 04:00.460]  back as I was making my selections. She's like, get that honey banana. These four gram
[04:00.460 --> 04:04.780]  jars are rare and they are fucking impressive. So on the back of the package, it says this
[04:04.780 --> 04:12.660]  product does contain 64.09% THC zero CBD. I really dig. The flavor is fucking delicious.
[04:12.660 --> 04:17.880]  It's funky. It's sweet. It's a stanky it's banana candies and some sort of dirty feet
[04:17.880 --> 04:23.580]  ish sort of stuff. I'm really digging it. And it's got a nice buzz to it. It was a beautiful
[04:23.580 --> 04:27.700]  for a comedy show. I allegedly may have taken a fat dab of that right before I walked into
[04:27.700 --> 04:33.140]  the comedy show. Yeah. And I was hot boxed in there. Allegedly I was stoned as fuck for
[04:33.140 --> 04:36.060]  most of that comedy show. Like, you know, when you're stoned and like, you're like,
[04:36.060 --> 04:40.540]  Oh, I'm just stoned. Just got to sit here and smile. Like I, I feel stoned in a crowd.
[04:40.540 --> 04:45.260]  Like it's hard to get that stoned sometimes for me. I've been at this for a while. And
[04:45.260 --> 04:49.580]  I was like, I'm in a crowd feeling cheesy. And it was great. That was a fun time. That
[04:49.580 --> 04:53.420]  was a great time. We're going to get to that part. That's a good tease. We keep teasing
[04:53.420 --> 04:58.180]  the comedy show before we do that. We should give some shout outs to the people who support
[04:58.180 --> 05:02.940]  the show on Patreon. Let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast. Shout
[05:02.940 --> 05:07.260]  out to our buddy, dude, dank UK. I always want to send a giant grow from your heart
[05:07.260 --> 05:11.940]  podcast shout out and a high five to our buddy, Richard Memel. How about a big grow from your
[05:11.940 --> 05:17.100]  heart podcast? Thank you. Shout out and a fist bump to Woodside 195. I always want to
[05:17.100 --> 05:21.060]  send some love to Comatic. How about a big giant grow from your heart podcast? Thank
[05:21.060 --> 05:25.980]  you. And a shout out to Melvin 818. I also got to send some love to our good friend,
[05:25.980 --> 05:31.580]  Justin. How about a big high five to Darren W. We always got to send a big hug to our
[05:31.580 --> 05:35.420]  friend, the growing granny. Of course, a big giant grow from your heart podcast. Shout
[05:35.420 --> 05:40.180]  out to our friends at Hogan's farms. And last but certainly not least, we need to send a
[05:40.180 --> 05:45.460]  big thank you. Shout out to our friend, Captain Mojo. That is a lot of Patreon support this
[05:45.460 --> 05:49.440]  month. Got a lot of shout outs to give. Big thanks to everybody who has been supporting
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.540]  the show. We have been setting new goals, setting new limits on Patreon. It feels great.
[05:54.540 --> 05:58.140]  Thank you for all of the continued support. Actually, Clint's got a new microphone cover,
[05:58.140 --> 06:01.220]  so it doesn't smell like Mike spit. And Mike will have a new one. It doesn't smell like
[06:01.220 --> 06:05.820]  Clint spit. That's what we buy with the Patreon funds, is microphone covers. We cover things
[06:05.820 --> 06:10.660]  like the computer. Back in the day, the computer crashed. And the kind folks from Patreon were
[06:10.660 --> 06:14.620]  nice enough to help replace the computer. So that's what we do with the Patreon funds.
[06:14.620 --> 06:18.820]  It also pays for the website. I've got a website where I host it. It also pays for the internet
[06:18.820 --> 06:22.220]  connection because we got the high speed internet to post the show. So that's what I do with
[06:22.220 --> 06:26.220]  the funds. So big thank you for keeping the show for free for everybody. Because the Patreon
[06:26.220 --> 06:30.500]  folks contribute to the show, I can do it for free for you. So big thanks to all of
[06:30.500 --> 06:35.420]  the Patreon supporters. It's starting to sound like a PBS special in here. So let's talk
[06:35.420 --> 06:42.780]  about some comedy. Bro, we got to go see Andrew Santino at the greatest comedy club on the
[06:42.780 --> 06:48.060]  planet at Comedy Works downtown in Denver, Colorado. Dude, that was a great show. Thanks
[06:48.060 --> 06:53.260]  for coming with me, bro. Dude, that was so much fun. I would do that over and over again.
[06:53.260 --> 06:56.420]  That was such a good night. I had a great time. The only thing that would be different
[06:56.420 --> 07:03.900]  for me is I-25 is a little bitch right now. Let's get I-25 fixed, please. That is a headache.
[07:03.900 --> 07:09.580]  Holy crap. Shout out to everybody who has to drive up and down I-25 in Colorado. Man,
[07:09.580 --> 07:13.880]  I know I'm just bitching about local shit right now. Man, fix that, please. But everything
[07:13.880 --> 07:18.960]  else I would repeat. But the drive was no good, dude. Yeah, Denver's rough. Getting
[07:18.960 --> 07:26.320]  up there, it's, I don't know. It's local references. Yeah, it's 130 mile drive. And it was 100
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.040]  miles of stressful crap. I made the joke of it took us two hours to get to Denver and
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.880]  then 30 minutes to get from Denver to Denver. It sure did. Yeah, it was quite fucking accurate.
[07:34.880 --> 07:40.000]  So we made it to Denver. It was a fun ride. We almost died twice. Yeah. Yeah. Then I noticed
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.920]  there may have been others that I was oblivious to. But there were two times. Yeah, the guy
[07:42.960 --> 07:49.600]  from behind just scared the crap out of me. When it happened, Jeff put his hand in front
[07:49.600 --> 07:56.200]  of me like a mom nursing a child and I put my hand on his hand like scared. It was so
[07:56.200 --> 08:02.080]  scary. That was awkward. I'm used to having a daughter or a girlfriend over there. It's
[08:02.080 --> 08:07.280]  hardly ever a dude or a bro. I've got a 16 year old daughter who's, she's a skinny little
[08:07.280 --> 08:10.600]  thing and she would have gone fucking flying in that incident. So I think I was thinking
[08:10.720 --> 08:14.240]  she was over there. She would have been through the windshield in that one, bro. So I could
[08:14.240 --> 08:17.680]  have grabbed her scrawny little ass and held her down. I appreciate it, Jeff. Yeah, bro.
[08:17.680 --> 08:23.760]  I got your back. And then once I realized I was doing it, I couldn't make my hand stop
[08:23.760 --> 08:28.560]  because I was so focused on like, Oh no, you were stopping and breaking. And I was looking
[08:28.560 --> 08:31.760]  in the mirror more than anything else. Watching. Like you said, that fucking truck come behind
[08:31.760 --> 08:36.120]  us was no thank you. I thought we were going to be an accordion. Yeah, I was plenty puckered.
[08:36.120 --> 08:40.680]  So yeah, it was a good ride. We fucking made it. Uh, one, one incident of bromance. It
[08:40.680 --> 08:46.160]  was all right. We survived. Um, so then we got there and allegedly I may have smoked
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.200]  some of this honey banana live batter and gotten nicely lit. We thought we were going
[08:50.200 --> 08:54.640]  to go for a brief walk. Uh, mother nature told us otherwise we got out of that parking
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.800]  garage and mother nature said, Hey bitch, it's cold out here. Yeah. So we, uh, scampered
[08:59.800 --> 09:05.640]  skedaddled into the comedy works. We hustled over there. We barely fit to the, uh, entryway
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.400]  was that the foyer, the box office area, the opening bar there of comedy works only holds
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.640]  so many people in that small space. We made it hold two big guys more. She seemed he was
[09:14.640 --> 09:18.480]  moving over the, uh, I didn't see you move the little rope that cuts off the sections.
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.320]  I didn't see you creating room for us, man. Yeah. There was a whole nother person allowed
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.560]  in there. Cause it fit. Oh, they got, I think we got four or five more people in once you
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.240]  move that little thing, allegedly possibly. So I don't know. I mean, I didn't move it,
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.960]  but like a foot. Yeah. But if you think about a foot times, 10 feet long, that's 10 feet.
[09:34.040 --> 09:36.920]  Yeah. That's 10 feet, right? It was 10 feet long and he moved it over a foot. That's 10
[09:36.920 --> 09:40.280]  feet worth of space. You created awesome. Anyway, we got in there, it was warm. Uh,
[09:40.280 --> 09:44.200]  we finally were not freezing. We got to chill out a little bit. Uh, big shout out to my friend,
[09:44.200 --> 09:47.560]  Jordan at the ticket booth for taking good care. Oh yeah. Thanks Jordan. It's always good to see
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.600]  Jordan up there. Um, I love comedy works comedy. I always talk about this on the show and people
[09:52.600 --> 09:56.760]  are probably tired of hearing about it, but I love it. Comedy works treats me like a fucking
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.960]  rockstar, like a VIP. I've been to that club a hundred times. I've seen a hundred comedians
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.920]  there. That's not an exaggeration. I'm probably accurate saying a hundred shows on stage there.
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.680]  I've been on the stage a couple of times there. I've been on the Doug loves movie show with Doug
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.400]  Benson. I've participated in a couple of games on other Douglas movie shows. I've been on the
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.960]  stage and other, uh, other times there. And they know me by now. They know my first name and shit.
[10:19.960 --> 10:23.560]  They're like, what's up Rasta Jeff. And they high five me as I walked through. Yeah. So they treat
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.000]  us like royalty there. They give us really good seats. They gave me a seat with nobody in front
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.640]  of me so I could stretch out my long fucking Rasta legs. That was kind of nice. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.320]  I noticed when I stretched my legs, I was like, this is very bad posture for a comedy show for a
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.960]  comedian to see. I'm going to fix my posture. Oh yeah. But just even being able to like kick
[10:39.960 --> 10:44.840]  your legs out for a minute. Yeah. When you're as tall as us, it does matter. Um, so comedy works,
[10:44.840 --> 10:48.840]  they seated us. We get down to the, uh, the ticket booth and the ladies like the young
[10:48.840 --> 10:52.680]  lady that works the ticket booth is like, what's up guys. Welcome back. And high fives us and kind
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.240]  of friendly harasses us, which is always nice, you know, to be trolled by the people that like
[10:57.240 --> 10:59.960]  you and help you out when you get there. It's always cool. It's a comedy club. You better be
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.680]  able to take some trolling. Yeah, dude. And it's nice just to have those people that you can like
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.200]  recognize this. I don't know. I enjoy it. It's fun being part of that little crew. We, uh, it's a
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.680]  business. So the main thing is we spend money there, but that's not for sure. A lot of people
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.360]  spend money there, but we go there and we're respectful. We've made friends there. We tip.
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.280]  Well, we know what to order off the minute and we're good. I think we're a good comedy audience.
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.640]  Some people behind us, not such good comedy audiences. The opening act had to tell them to
[11:27.640 --> 11:32.680]  shut the fuck up a couple of times. And that's Clinton. I know too. We shut the fuck up. It is
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.480]  not our show. We're there to laugh and have a good time and be told comedy. You don't participate,
[11:37.480 --> 11:40.840]  which we'll get to. I know you're just dying to say that when I said, you don't participate.
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.680]  Uh, you just, you're there to be told jokes. You don't do the, when somebody says, you know what
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.920]  I like beer, you don't go, I like beer too. That's the most obnoxious shit to do at a comedy show.
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.960]  And Clinton, I know just see a show, have a good time. Don't bug anybody. Don't be a distraction.
[11:53.960 --> 11:58.840]  So we get seated. They give us those great seats, bro. It's perfect. Beautiful, perfect
[11:58.840 --> 12:05.080]  seats. Great view. Great, great leg room. Uh, then it was really, uh, kind of a coincidence
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.720]  that I was talking about some of my favorite Denver local comedians. Yeah. You even said on
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.120]  the way up there, you were like, cause I asked like, well, who's like the biggest Denver comedian
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.920]  right now? And you said, well, my favorite is Elliot Woolsey. Uh, yeah. I think it's Woolsey
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.360]  or Woolsey. He'll make fun of us no matter how we say it, we're going to get it wrong.
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.480]  Big shout out to Elliot. He's a great fucking comedian. Um, yeah, he's, uh, at his level right
[12:29.480 --> 12:35.640]  now, he's really one of the top Denver locals. He's a really good, super funny. Yeah. So I said,
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.560]  he's one of my favorites and he happened to be the MC of the night. So the comedy works goes,
[12:39.560 --> 12:43.320]  ladies and gentlemen coming to the stage or MC for the night, it's Elliot Woolsey. And he comes
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.440]  out and I was like, dude, it's fucking the guy I said, looks like John Elway. That's awesome.
[12:46.440 --> 12:51.240]  He does have a good John Elway chin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little Gary Busey, John Elway going on,
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.400]  but he's fucking a great dude. And he's tall as shit. One thing he did that I found hilarious,
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.680]  the, so he's the MC. He comes out and he says, this is the welcome to the club, whatever he does,
[13:00.680 --> 13:05.160]  all that stuff. You know, the buy drinks, tip your waitress, ha ha ha don't heckle people.
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.480]  Then he brings out the first comedian. The first comedian was not a short guy. He was
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.280]  a normal size guy. He might've been a short guy, but I'm six, five. So he looked a little short,
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.280]  but he might've been normal size. Then Elliot comes back after he performs. And instead of
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.960]  adjusting the microphone, he just picks up the whole microphone stand. That was great. It didn't
[13:23.960 --> 13:30.120]  look awkward in any way because Elliot's got to be six, two, six, three, six, five. Did he? Okay.
[13:30.120 --> 13:33.240]  Yeah. Well, I don't remember, but yeah, he's a tall fucking dude, but the way he just held that
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.920]  mic stand, it just looked like an ogre with a normal microphone holder. You're just like,
[13:36.920 --> 13:40.440]  yeah, that's, that's fucking accurate. It was just, it was killing me just watching him hold
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.080]  the mic stand like that. I don't know if he does it to be comedic or if he's like, fuck it,
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.720]  I'm not going to adjust it because I'm going to lift it up and then be like, okay, here's the
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.160]  next comedian. And then put it right back down. So he just plays with it the way it is. It was
[13:53.160 --> 13:56.760]  fucking funny to me. It was just really funny. But Elliot, dude, if you ever hear this, if you
[13:56.760 --> 13:59.880]  hear about me, I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks. It's always at comedy works.
[13:59.880 --> 14:05.400]  I think you're fucking hilarious, bro. Great MC work. I've heard a lot of his jokes. He does a
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.640]  lot of good work. He only did two or three, three or four minutes. The show was slightly rushed
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.880]  because they added a second show. There wasn't supposed to be a second show. If they knew there
[14:13.880 --> 14:18.040]  was going to be show number two, that show would have happened at seven instead of eight. So you
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.840]  can get the hustle going a little earlier. That's just logistics of the show. We just started too
[14:22.840 --> 14:27.640]  late. So then the other show getting added, he's had six shows this weekend. Yeah. Big shout out
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.960]  to Andrew Santino. Six fucking sold out comedy work shows and the crowd had so much good energy.
[14:33.960 --> 14:40.680]  Oh dude. But the, the second, the feature act. Yeah. Chris O'Connor. O'Connor. Yeah. You found
[14:40.680 --> 14:44.120]  him on Twitter because you were in love with him, bro. He was driving home. He was funny.
[14:44.120 --> 14:47.720]  Clint was half asleep on the ride home. And every, every time he would wake up,
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.160]  he would jolt himself awake and go, yeah, that Chris O'Connor guy was pretty funny. I liked his
[14:51.160 --> 14:54.920]  act. Like he thought that that was where he fell asleep talking every time he fell asleep on the
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.520]  car ride home. So that's where he went back to. And it was fucking funny. I was digging it.
[14:58.600 --> 15:04.360]  I'm into that. Wow. That dude was pretty funny. Yeah. He, he walks out and he was from Philly.
[15:04.360 --> 15:07.400]  So he walks out on stage and the crowd's kind of already giggling and shit a little bit. It
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.080]  takes him a minute to settle down after they introduce him in his first line. He like shakes
[15:11.080 --> 15:15.000]  his head and he goes, man, fuck you guys. Yeah. That was great. It was just so good. Fuck you
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.560]  guys. Fuck you guys. And everyone's like, what the fuck? But it was like this childish, like
[15:19.560 --> 15:25.080]  playful kind of cute way though. Like he wasn't like being mean. He was just, fuck you guys. Like
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.320]  with a smile, I'm happy to be here. This is exciting. And then he's like, I'm from Philly
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.400]  and everybody goes, Oh, that's why he starts with fuck you guys. Yeah. That was almost like
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.800]  the intro to Philly. Everybody here looks like they're fucking working out. He's like, let's get
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.920]  fucking drunk and go jog. And he's like, where I'm from. Uh, the only, he's like flew into the
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.800]  airport. I don't want to burn his material, but he said, I flew into the airport. I thought it
[15:45.800 --> 15:49.800]  was going to suck. You guys got a fucking beer garden and people are hanging out in there vaping.
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.040]  And he said, his airport, the only reason that people go to the Philly airport is to buy meth.
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.720]  I thought that or to get an abortion was his backup joke. And I don't know if I wanted to
[15:57.720 --> 16:02.040]  say that, but it was, it was his joke and it was fucking, that's how he starts the show.
[16:02.040 --> 16:08.840]  So it was pretty good. He was very, very funny. He had so much good material and he was so level.
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.560]  And then he was dealing with those hecklers who couldn't shut their mouths. And he did it in such
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.280]  a respectful way that he didn't lose the audience. Right. And being from Philly, you could, you could
[16:18.280 --> 16:23.320]  see that he had the ability to tell you to go fuck yourself. Like he was right there. He had
[16:23.320 --> 16:29.560]  an aggressive, just enough aggressive vibe. It was really neat. It wasn't like angry, aggressive,
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.560]  but he had some aggressive aggression to his presentation. You know what I mean? Like you
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.600]  could tell he wasn't from Inglewood. You could tell he was, he was from fucking Philly, but it
[16:38.600 --> 16:43.080]  was great. It was, I don't know. It was a cool vibe. When you're telling, when you're trying
[16:43.080 --> 16:49.000]  to command a room of 300 people who weren't there to see you, you have to have a specific energy.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.480]  You can't just be a very generic energy, like a basic comic. It's not going to work. So he came
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.320]  out with something. You got to have some sort of hot sauce on you to get the attention. And he did
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.360]  it. That's a really good room too. That's so much fun. It is. But when you're not the headliner,
[17:02.360 --> 17:07.560]  it could be a hard room also when the headliner is Santino, when like Andrew Santino has got a
[17:07.560 --> 17:12.440]  very popular podcast. He's been on Rogan. He is really, I think Rogan. Well, he was touring with
[17:12.440 --> 17:16.760]  Rogan too. Yeah. He, the last time we saw Rogan, he was the opener. So yeah, he's just building the
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.320]  crowd. Half the people that were there were probably at that last show. So yeah, his audience
[17:21.320 --> 17:25.320]  is getting huge. So that means it's, people are just antsy. It's like being the opening act,
[17:25.320 --> 17:28.440]  like Metallica's playing and you're a fucking Volbeat. And everyone's just like, who?
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.520]  Bring out Metallica. And they're throwing fucking bottles at you and shit.
[17:32.520 --> 17:35.560]  Yeah, we don't care. No, but that audience was real receptive of that guy.
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.960]  Yeah. Cause he demanded it and he did a good job at it. Yeah. I don't remember a lot of his material
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.240]  because it was kind of shocky. It was a lot of jokes make me go, ha ha funny. And a lot of jokes
[17:45.240 --> 17:50.760]  make me go, Oh shit. Like it's like, Oh, he fucking said that. Like, yeah, he had a lot of
[17:50.760 --> 17:54.920]  that material and I was digging that. Yeah. Santino came out. That was pretty fun. Okay.
[17:54.920 --> 18:01.800]  And then we bring out Santino and man, the, one of the best fucking parts is he comes out
[18:01.800 --> 18:06.040]  and I don't even know what brought it up, but the first thing he did was make fun of fucking Theo
[18:06.040 --> 18:10.360]  Vaughn. Oh, that was funny. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, even know what brought it up. And he's like,
[18:10.360 --> 18:13.720]  all right, you guys are going to see Theo next week at the other club. Cause Theo's in Denver
[18:13.720 --> 18:16.600]  next week. And we're going to be there for that one shot at the comedy works. Can't wait to see
[18:16.600 --> 18:20.840]  again. Uh, and he goes, you guys are going to see Theo next week. Let me just, let me save you some
[18:20.840 --> 18:27.640]  time back in my town. We got a man who did this and does that in my town. He did the most perfect
[18:27.640 --> 18:32.680]  Theo impression and it was beautiful. And the crowd loved it. He had us from then on. It's,
[18:32.680 --> 18:38.680]  it's amazing how widespread that like podcast community is just in like the comedy scene.
[18:38.680 --> 18:42.280]  That's pretty cool. Like everybody kind of listens to everybody. Everybody kind of knows
[18:42.280 --> 18:47.960]  everybody now. It's great. This what podcasting can do for just, I don't know what the freedom
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.280]  of speech kind of, I love it. We don't get force-fed crappy commercials that you don't
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.200]  really like. I throw a couple of ads at the start. You get a fucking seeds here now commercial at the
[18:56.200 --> 19:02.360]  beginning. Yeah. 20 seconds, you know, but you don't get a bunch of crappy commercials and ads
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.440]  for shit that you don't want. You don't get shown a bunch of fucking fast food restaurant ads with a
[19:06.440 --> 19:11.560]  naked girl in it. Yeah. Pointless stuff. And podcasts are, it's a much better form of free
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.320]  entertainment, I think. And you're right then, sorry for the throat clearing guys. That'll go
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.760]  away in a second. Like through Rogan, I found, I don't know that I found, but I found Santino. I
[19:20.760 --> 19:26.440]  found Theo. I found Joey Diaz, Ari, Ari, and then you go listen to Diaz and you find people like
[19:26.440 --> 19:32.120]  Lee Sayat and fucking Token Laird and just other people that branch off. Yeah. Yeah. It's just,
[19:32.120 --> 19:38.040]  it's crazy how, how easy it is to find things. Eric Griffin. Oh man. How wonderful. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:38.040 --> 19:42.280]  I don't know that I would, uh, Griffin was on, uh, I'm dying up here is the name of the show,
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.840]  right? But I found him through Santino. I think, I think he was on Andrew Santino's podcast is how
[19:46.840 --> 19:51.000]  I found Eric Griffin and he was Montez and I should have found him through there. But yeah,
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.120]  but he was, I mean, that guy's funny. And so like even, even a guy like that who just has a podcast,
[19:56.120 --> 20:01.080]  now you can just find them. I just like the accessibility of things now. It's fun. It's
[20:01.080 --> 20:05.160]  exciting. Yeah. Podcasting is amazing. I don't even know what got us on podcast. Santino's got
[20:05.160 --> 20:09.560]  a podcast called whiskey ginger. We should bring that up probably. Uh, so Santino comes out and
[20:10.200 --> 20:14.520]  I've never seen him do a long set. I've seen him do like four or five minutes. And so you get,
[20:15.080 --> 20:19.000]  you just get settled in as a comedian when you're that, when you're a pro and you've got hours of
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.760]  material, five minutes is like, eh, I'm going to come tell you a quick joke and I got to go and
[20:22.760 --> 20:29.560]  let Joe Rogan come out. But last night he got to harness the fucking stage. Uh, I don't know if,
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.960]  I'm not even going to say any of his material, but he's got a premise like that, a kind of a
[20:33.960 --> 20:38.840]  recurring theme that kind of, he bases his stuff around and it is so on point and it is so needed
[20:38.840 --> 20:46.280]  right now. It was super fun too. Like he just, he, he seems so comfortable on that stage too.
[20:46.280 --> 20:49.800]  He just seemed like he was hanging out and we were just kind of fucking fooling around.
[20:49.800 --> 20:55.480]  I like that. That's, that's my kind of comedy. He's able to tell, uh, there's about two or three
[20:55.480 --> 21:02.520]  minutes of Trump jokes in that hour of material. And to tell a Trump joke on a tour, he's not just
[21:02.520 --> 21:06.920]  coming to this club to do it. He's going to do this material across the country. It was pretty
[21:06.920 --> 21:12.920]  middle ground. Yeah. It's, it's really a neat, uh, to not get booed by anybody in the crowd.
[21:12.920 --> 21:16.920]  Cause everybody was like, yeah, you know, that's true. Yeah. I don't know, man. It was just,
[21:16.920 --> 21:19.560]  it was very funny. The way that he did it was perfect. You're right.
[21:20.360 --> 21:24.680]  And it's gotta be hard to do a Trump joke and not get booed by anybody. There's nearly 300 people.
[21:24.680 --> 21:28.920]  I think there's 280 something people in that club and nobody was bothered by the Trump joke because
[21:28.920 --> 21:33.240]  of the way he did it. So yeah, that, that takes a lot of skill as a comedian. He really is a, uh,
[21:33.960 --> 21:39.960]  uh, a very artful guy when it comes to his presentation and everything. I don't know. I,
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.640]  everything I saw out of it, I was really studying it. So I was excited by it.
[21:43.640 --> 21:49.240]  We do overstudy the comedy a little bit. We, uh, with the, the whole thing, like,
[21:49.240 --> 21:54.440]  I don't know how many people caught that other than us. Like those. Yeah. And then when he asked,
[21:54.440 --> 21:58.680]  did you catch the progression? Like, I'm not sure how many people caught that either, but yeah,
[21:59.080 --> 22:03.560]  that's really funny. The, the, the meta is that called very meta, the meta stuff,
[22:03.560 --> 22:06.840]  the meta stuff. Yeah. The fourth wall stuff. I think that's sort of shit.
[22:06.840 --> 22:11.960]  I don't know the stuff that, uh, makes it an act. I don't know. It's exciting. I,
[22:11.960 --> 22:15.880]  I like all that stuff. I like live theater. That stuff's fun, man. We get to go see all
[22:15.880 --> 22:22.520]  these comedy shows and comedy works is just fantastic. And then we'll be at the, uh, we got,
[22:22.520 --> 22:27.960]  we got to meet our new friend, Kelsey. Oh yeah. Who was that's so fortuitous that you were just
[22:27.960 --> 22:33.960]  wearing that pin. Yeah. I've got a happens like, Hey, yeah, there's a, I, I, I like that guy too.
[22:33.960 --> 22:39.080]  What? I've got Brody Stevens on my hat. Got to give Brody Stevens a big shout out. Uh, got Brody on
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.560]  my hat and I'm sitting there cause Clint went to the restroom and she was sitting there by herself
[22:43.560 --> 22:47.240]  because she actually works for the other comedy works and she's a comedy fan. She just wanted to
[22:47.240 --> 22:51.000]  go see the show. And so I'm sitting there by myself. She's by herself. And she said, I love
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.640]  your pen. And I had to think about what was up there. I was like, Oh, it's Brody. And so that
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.120]  was a great couple of minute conversation about Broden. I just threw out, we just traded Brody
[23:00.120 --> 23:05.480]  isms. Uh, if you guys were Brody Stevens fans, he used to say stuff like a positive energy,
[23:05.480 --> 23:10.920]  enjoy it, enjoy it. And so she said something about, I said, you got to keep Brody around.
[23:10.920 --> 23:16.280]  She goes positive energy. And then I said, enjoy it. And she replied with, you got it. And I was
[23:16.280 --> 23:20.280]  like, Oh fuck. Like that's a Brody fan right there. We're already friends. Yeah. We're yeah.
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.760]  We're homies for life now. So made friends with Kelsey. Uh, actually going to see her because
[23:24.760 --> 23:28.440]  she works at comedy works where we're going to see Theo, the other comedy works club. So that'll
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.600]  be cool. Yeah, that was cool. I was just, I don't know, little things like that. Yeah. I don't know
[23:32.600 --> 23:37.240]  making friends. They put you in the right seat. It sounded like, yeah, it was in just the right seat.
[23:37.240 --> 23:42.520]  That was so funny. Just the right seat. So, uh, we, I don't know how important it is, but Jeff
[23:42.520 --> 23:48.360]  got picked out of the crowd. He was, you were, I said, when I sat in that seat, I was like, this
[23:48.360 --> 23:53.800]  is the fuck with me spot right here. Isn't it? It really was. There's nobody in front of me.
[23:53.800 --> 23:58.120]  Uh, and it's, there's a clear view of me cause I'm tall. I just kind of stand out. I got these,
[23:58.120 --> 24:02.600]  my dread, I had my dreadlocks down and they're draped all over the fucking place. So I stand out
[24:02.600 --> 24:07.400]  a little bit and he told a joke that made me laugh. Go ahead. I'll let you, I interrupted you.
[24:07.400 --> 24:11.960]  You know, he was, he told a joke, we were laughing and kind of shaking our heads. Yes. And then he
[24:11.960 --> 24:17.000]  asked like a real specific question and we were kind of still shaking our heads. Yes. And he
[24:17.640 --> 24:21.880]  looked right at Jeff who has those light right above him, shining down on him. He's shaking
[24:21.880 --> 24:26.120]  his head. Yes. And it was kind of an inappropriate question. I don't really want to burn through his
[24:26.120 --> 24:32.120]  material, but all of a sudden Jeff's having to talk to Santino on stage. And that was super fun
[24:32.120 --> 24:37.000]  that just like, I don't know, dude, it was just a good night for like fun stuff to happen like that.
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.200]  When, uh, I don't know how everybody feels this way, but when you're front row to comedy show
[24:42.200 --> 24:49.160]  and the comedian calls on you, I feel like I have got the biggest spotlight on me suddenly.
[24:49.160 --> 24:56.680]  And I feel like, Oh God. And there was no answer to that question. Oh man. It was so dirty. The
[24:56.680 --> 25:03.720]  question itself was so dirty that like, Oh, okay. Well, I wish I hadn't got picked for this one,
[25:03.720 --> 25:11.960]  but I'll, I'll tell you what it means. And then, so, oh, the, the best was how excited he was for
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.400]  your answer though. So that, I don't know. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Like I knew in
[25:17.400 --> 25:22.120]  detail, like, unfortunately I know exactly. I think that's the comedy God's looking down on us
[25:22.120 --> 25:28.120]  and going like, you guys are such good audience members. You guys never say anything rude. You're,
[25:28.120 --> 25:33.480]  if you, if it's not funny, you just shut your mouth. He made this face of, Oh my God, that's
[25:33.480 --> 25:37.560]  exactly what I was fucking hoping you were going to say. How did you know that? He said that a few
[25:37.560 --> 25:43.880]  times. He was like that, the answer, he said it over and over giddy. He was dancing around. He
[25:43.880 --> 25:50.520]  looked like an elf. I've got, yeah, he did. He made this Elfkin face. I do have a touch of,
[25:50.520 --> 25:56.120]  I like to think I've got a touch of comedy in me and I seized the opportunity. I did not want to
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.480]  embarrass myself, but in that answer, that's fucking, you have to embarrass yourself. That's
[26:01.480 --> 26:05.480]  part of why he asked somebody, it was going to be embarrassing. That was pretty funny. But I
[26:05.480 --> 26:12.200]  also wanted to speak fucking like I cleared my throat and I was like, Oh, um, and I said it very
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.680]  clearly, but I was saying the whole audience heard you. Yeah. The whole 300 people, you know,
[26:16.680 --> 26:22.360]  what? That's because we got some voices that carry podcasting experience and also just being,
[26:22.360 --> 26:28.760]  you know, deep voiced, but I had to say something super embarrassing with much, much pride,
[26:28.760 --> 26:34.120]  like very matter of factly, here's the answer to your perverted question, sir. And I nailed it,
[26:34.120 --> 26:39.720]  but I said it with a hint of funny, but I did not embarrass myself. I had to, you know what I mean?
[26:40.440 --> 26:44.920]  I didn't do it. He was so happy with you. That was what, that was the best part. It was like,
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.760]  it was fucking great. He didn't, he didn't make fun of you after it. He was just like,
[26:48.760 --> 26:55.960]  fuck. Yes. He appropriately made fun of me. He did because. Oh, on the, yeah, I guess,
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.440]  I guess I didn't feel like no. And I'd laugh. He didn't believe it as fucking good. I was like,
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.040]  that's a good way to turn that one on me right there. I was like, and I love it. I'm,
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.120]  I'm all about being the butt of thick skin. Yeah. Oh dude, I joke with you and you're an
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.200]  asshole and you joke with me and I'm an asshole. Yeah. But we can, we have, we can have a rapport
[27:12.200 --> 27:17.640]  between the two of us, like a back and forth, but when he's got the mic, it's real tough to,
[27:17.640 --> 27:23.160]  to combat him as like the guy with the mic and we know better anyway. Right. Well, I know that I've
[27:23.160 --> 27:27.240]  got one answer. Yes. I hate it when they, when the comedian goes, what do you do for work,
[27:27.240 --> 27:31.000]  Bill? And Bill goes, oh, I'm a scientist. I work over in it. And by the time he goes,
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.080]  I'm a scientist, I work over. Like the comedian's taking the microphone away and doesn't give a
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.400]  fuck. The comedian already knew what he was going to say. He just needed you to say some,
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.880]  I bacon and he would have kept going. What do you do for work? Bacon. Okay. Well, Bill, I do this.
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.320]  He didn't care about your answer. And I knew better than to be that asshole. Oh no, it was
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.880]  just the right answer. He, he waited for you. It was, I don't know, man, I really, it was really
[27:51.880 --> 27:57.800]  good. He's I just loved that we had that interaction. It was fun. It was embarrassing,
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.720]  embarrassingly, perfectly embarrassingly hilarious. I wasn't like offendedly embarrassed.
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.560]  I was like, that was fucking good. He got me with that joke. He set me up, he knocked me down,
[28:05.560 --> 28:10.680]  but then he left it as like, that was the perfect answer. Yeah, well I did. There was
[28:10.680 --> 28:17.560]  comedy to my answer and it was right. So it was, yeah. Yeah. So dumb. This is like,
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.520]  we're just eluding around these like words that we can't say. All right. Sorry. No, I said my,
[28:22.520 --> 28:25.800]  I'm just going to say my punchline was save it up and give her a big one.
[28:25.960 --> 28:34.280]  I said, Dino was so excited. Okay. That's enough of that. All right. So, um, so we got to see a
[28:34.280 --> 28:38.600]  fucking great comedy show. We got to see a great comedy show. Uh, and you guys, I know this is a
[28:38.600 --> 28:42.040]  weed podcast, but dude, sometimes I gotta just come out of here and share my life. And I've
[28:42.040 --> 28:47.320]  been giving you so much cannabis content. Um, the next episode is number 500. Exciting. That is a
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.520]  really good episode. I feel like, uh, we're going to have a lot of fun cause I've got some cool
[28:50.520 --> 28:56.360]  people lined up for that one. Uh, then, uh, five Oh one through what a lot of stuff after that is
[28:56.360 --> 29:02.360]  going to be gross stuff. I've got the mix episode lined up. Uh, I have got, um, popping and twist.
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.080]  No, we did popping and twisting. I got topping. Um, I got, um, some other stuff like that. There
[29:07.080 --> 29:09.880]  were more grow lessons and stuff lined up. I don't have the note right here in front of me,
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.200]  but I think topping is on the list. Yeah. I was listening to you talking about popping,
[29:14.200 --> 29:18.440]  but we had to do topping. No, go ahead, man. Oh, sorry, dude. I was, uh, I was listening to you
[29:18.440 --> 29:23.000]  talking about, uh, shaping the legs and everything on the girls. So I really took that. I was like,
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.680]  yeah, all those little things need to get the hell out of there. So that was good, man. No,
[29:26.680 --> 29:32.600]  I liked that. Get those trellises up and really just work on them. Buds up top. Hell yeah. No,
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.320]  it's, it's good. I hope everybody's listening to those. I hope everybody's listening to these as
[29:37.320 --> 29:42.200]  well, but I mean, your knowledge of the marijuana plant is pretty phenomenal. So thank you, dude.
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.120]  Thank you. Uh, I just think it's fun to kind of bring people in and let them kind of hang out
[29:46.120 --> 29:49.000]  with us a little bit. We don't always have to be sitting here and talking about weed and doing
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.040]  intense grow lessons. Part of it, I say the show is about cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[29:54.040 --> 29:57.560]  This is the conversation. Welcome to our world. You guys, you're here at the table smoking with
[29:57.560 --> 30:01.960]  us, taking a dab. I hope you're still hanging out. I appreciate you. I love you. So at the end of the
[30:01.960 --> 30:07.800]  show, uh, they said, uh, we've got another show backed up behind you. You can't get out the door.
[30:07.800 --> 30:12.040]  You can't, you either need to go that way to get the fuck out or that way and get a picture with
[30:12.040 --> 30:17.240]  Santino. And so what the fuck do you think I did, bro? We went that way. Uh, I got a picture with
[30:17.240 --> 30:22.520]  Santino. Clint is not very sentimental. Uh, Clint's got the memory in his head. So he shook his hand
[30:22.520 --> 30:26.520]  and told him, thank you. Yeah, that's all. I don't know. That's how I felt like doing it. But that's,
[30:26.520 --> 30:31.240]  that's, I mean, I liked the guy a lot, so I, there was also a long line and I knew he had shit to do.
[30:31.240 --> 30:35.400]  So I just put my hand in his hand and the lady took a quick click and I was like, thank you.
[30:35.400 --> 30:38.360]  And I said, man, thank you. That was a great show. And he goes, man, thank you. Cause he knew I was
[30:38.360 --> 30:42.680]  the guy he picked on. So he just smiled and shook his head. Yeah. No issue. Man. What a good guy.
[30:42.680 --> 30:46.920]  I really appreciated everything about that. Yeah. Make sure you guys check out the whiskey ginger
[30:46.920 --> 30:51.320]  podcast. It's, uh, it's called whiskey ginger because he is in fact a ginger and he drinks
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.000]  whiskey on the show. And if you're going to listen to a first one, listen to him, talk with Eric
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.760]  Griffin and you'll fall in love with both of them. They're really good friends. It's a really good
[30:58.760 --> 31:02.680]  show, really good chemistry. And then you'll end up listening to Riffin with Griffin and then you'll
[31:02.680 --> 31:07.480]  start driving around and going, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. And you look like a weirdo,
[31:07.480 --> 31:11.640]  but you will not care. We're going to get singing mics on this podcast or what? No,
[31:11.640 --> 31:15.240]  because that was the one time you're going to do that. And if I had a singing mic,
[31:15.240 --> 31:22.840]  you'd probably try to do it again. I'm not going to edit that. I don't have all the reverb and the
[31:22.840 --> 31:26.760]  fancies on these mics like Eric Griffin does. Yeah. He's pretty great though. That dude's funny.
[31:26.760 --> 31:31.320]  So, uh, appreciate those two guys. Shout out to Eric Griffin and the singing mic.
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.520]  Hey, since I'm doing shout outs, Oh, good. Uh, big shout out to our friend, Andrea at comedy
[31:36.520 --> 31:41.080]  works. Oh, thank you. I was, I kept meaning to talk about her and I just kept forgetting. She's
[31:41.080 --> 31:46.280]  such a sweetheart. Uh, never a better waitress. Never, never a better waitress. It's so nice.
[31:46.280 --> 31:50.680]  Even, even when we're not sitting where it's kind of her section, she's taking care of us.
[31:50.680 --> 31:54.120]  I come and give me a hug and say, hello. Yeah. That's how many times I've been to that club.
[31:54.120 --> 31:57.960]  She just got to come say hi. She's like, why aren't sometimes if I'm not in the right spot,
[31:58.040 --> 32:01.960]  but you're usually sitting right in the front. She did too. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, no, this is,
[32:01.960 --> 32:06.520]  I like the leg room right here. Yeah. Actually like being right up front is kind of like
[32:06.520 --> 32:11.560]  neck straining, but being in that, I'd say third row, it was pretty sweet. Yeah. But there's no
[32:11.560 --> 32:14.520]  seats in front of me. So it's still the front row because the seats taper, you know what I mean?
[32:14.520 --> 32:18.440]  They're like, yeah, we're right in the goddamn front. It's close enough. Dude. Hey, you didn't
[32:18.440 --> 32:24.040]  have to scream to get, uh, to talk to him. The, the way that comedy works is designed at the front
[32:24.120 --> 32:28.680]  two rows. You cannot hear the PA system. Yeah. And so if the crowd is still cheering and the
[32:28.680 --> 32:33.240]  comedian does a tagline, you may miss it. If you're right up front, we were right under the
[32:33.240 --> 32:38.280]  speaker and I love that. Yeah. It was so great. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Um, so then we had a great
[32:38.280 --> 32:42.920]  drive home. Uh, Clint was falling asleep. I was kind of fun. Stop and got some snacks. Not a big
[32:42.920 --> 32:48.040]  deal. Dude. I ate these blueberry muffins that I don't, that said blueberry muffins on the package.
[32:48.040 --> 32:52.120]  It was just like blueberry air freshener. I don't know what the fuck they put in those things. I
[32:52.200 --> 32:56.760]  ate one of them. My whole mouth was like, that's enough blueberry for your whole existence. And
[32:56.760 --> 33:00.360]  then like one minute later, the other two were gone. Yeah. I had to eat those things. I was
[33:00.360 --> 33:04.520]  fucking hungry. That was fun. Remember all those dads I talked about before the show? We do that.
[33:04.520 --> 33:10.280]  Yeah. I was hungry. Uh, then I got home and I had a whole bunch of mail, dude. Whole bunch of mail.
[33:10.280 --> 33:14.520]  Oh yeah. Yeah, dude. That sticker that you got there in front of you. You know what? Before
[33:14.520 --> 33:20.920]  we got home though, the, the scary, uh, situation with your Instagram. Oh, well that's resolved. So
[33:20.920 --> 33:25.160]  I know I'm just saying like, but that put like a damper on the night for a minute. It was just
[33:25.160 --> 33:29.720]  like, no, for some reason now you've got to be 21 to view my Instagram. And for a moment,
[33:29.720 --> 33:35.000]  my Instagram was suspended until I agreed to new terms of service. So if my Instagram was gone for
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.560]  a moment, it's back. Follow me. I re underscore genetics, but to remedy that problem, there is a
[33:39.560 --> 33:43.560]  grow from your heart podcast, Instagram. And I've been trying to be more active. They're trying to
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.080]  post more things there. Uh, so follow me on there. And if you're into my cannabis photography,
[33:49.080 --> 33:54.520]  I encourage you to follow me on cannabis. Cannabis is a free, uh, cannabis friendly
[33:54.520 --> 33:58.280]  social media application. When I say cannabis friendly, I do not mean you can buy, sell,
[33:58.280 --> 34:03.320]  trade, or exchange cannabis in any way, shape, or form. What I mean is you can post cannabis
[34:03.320 --> 34:07.640]  content. You can post your weed pictures. You can post your finished bud shots. You can post
[34:07.640 --> 34:12.840]  yourself in the garden. You can post your cool new IRI genetics logo. All those dad pictures that all
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.200]  them pretty girls like to take. They blink their eyes a bunch of times and they do a dab and they
[34:16.200 --> 34:20.680]  blow it out and make duck face at you. Yeah. And they blink girls are pretty. They do all the
[34:20.680 --> 34:24.520]  shoulder moves while they're taking dabs. Oh yeah. They look like a cat just like about to
[34:24.520 --> 34:28.280]  pounce on somebody. I'm like, why are your shoulders move so much while you dab? I don't
[34:28.280 --> 34:33.000]  do any of that, but you can do that on Instagram and you don't have to worry about your or on
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.920]  cannabis. You cannot do that on Instagram. You can do it on cannabis and you don't have to worry
[34:36.920 --> 34:41.080]  about your account being suspended or your photos being deleted or any of that good crap. So join
[34:41.080 --> 34:46.440]  us on cannabis. That's where I will be posting a lot of my quality photography. I'll be on
[34:46.440 --> 34:50.520]  Instagram until they shut me down. That happens now and then, but we don't got to worry about
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.720]  getting shut down on cannabis. Cannabis likes us. We friendly over there. And we're actually on good
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.280]  terms with all of the other providers, like the app providers. You got to get good on good terms
[35:00.280 --> 35:05.720]  with the app stores or they'll kick you out. And we're actually, they're okay with us. So cannabis.
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.600]  So what were we going to talk about the, what else was in your packages or is that secret
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.680]  top secret stuff? We got a new sticker design. You guys, I don't know if you've seen the,
[35:14.680 --> 35:18.840]  the cross logo that I've posted on social media. That is now a new sticker. I'll be giving those
[35:18.840 --> 35:24.120]  out at the Indo Expo. Yes. Drop by the booth. This is really close to the Indo Expo when this
[35:24.120 --> 35:31.080]  episode comes out, but drop by, say what's up. Then yes, we got new packaging. It's exciting,
[35:31.400 --> 35:37.880]  Yeah. The people know about, and I've got to be careful with the TMNT line. People know about the
[35:37.880 --> 35:41.240]  six that are involved in there. They don't know about the seventh. We're not going to talk about
[35:41.240 --> 35:44.120]  it, but we're going to hint that there's seven. We're going to keep saying seventh and they're
[35:44.120 --> 35:49.880]  going to go, what number seven? Yes. The TMNT line that I released a while back, I got brand
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.360]  new packaging designed and printed and made for that. The packaging has been delivered. It looks
[35:54.680 --> 36:01.160]  marvelous. They look so good. They included stickers. Yes. The first few packs to go will
[36:01.160 --> 36:05.160]  have stickers with them. Sweet. Yeah. They look just like the packaging. It's the front of the
[36:05.160 --> 36:11.080]  packaging and then the stickers redesigned just the same. Perfect. Yeah. There are six new
[36:11.720 --> 36:17.160]  packages. Soon there will be seven new packages available. We got to do some groundwork here
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.760]  first. We're working on it. Those will be, if everything goes well, all of that new packaging
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.920]  and the TMNT line will be restocked and available at all of your favorite vendors,
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.400]  hopefully by early March. Wow. That's coming right up. That's coming right up. Dude, they're,
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.720]  yeah, I'm just waiting for the beans to fucking be done, bro. The beans are cooking. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.160]  The beans are cooking. The beans are cooking. I like that. Yeah. They're looking good.
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.520]  Occasionally, this may sound savage, but I will just yank a bean out of a random plant and give
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.000]  it a crush and see how it looks and feels. Today was the first day that I went, oh, they're getting
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.200]  close. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Today was the day when I felt it coming on. I was like, oh, they're starting
[36:58.200 --> 37:03.320]  to look like tiger stripe seeds now instead of just little, little yellowy seed pods. How exciting.
[37:03.320 --> 37:08.600]  Yeah. Excited. So coming up, that's coming up. Oh man. All right. So where do we go next,
[37:08.600 --> 37:12.440]  Clint? I don't have any more notes. We got the new packaging covered. We gave shout outs to
[37:12.440 --> 37:17.080]  all of our friends from Comedy Works and from Denver. Big shout out to all three of the comedians,
[37:17.080 --> 37:26.120]  Elliot Woolsey, Chris O'Connor, and of course, Andrew Chido Santino. Red rocket. Red rocket. Make
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.920]  sure you check out his podcast. I know we just keep talking about the dude, but he gave us a
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.120]  great show. Made me laugh until my face felt weird. Like that was fun. Yeah. You get the weird feeling
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.720]  face at the end. You're like, are we done yet? Yeah. I can't fucking laugh anymore. I'm going
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.120]  to have a stroke over here. Yeah. That guy was great. It was so fun. What a good night. Yeah.
[37:42.680 --> 37:46.920]  Um, uh, I think that's the end of this bro down, bro. You want to start wrapping this up? Oh yeah.
[37:46.920 --> 37:53.560]  This bro romance needs to, you know, call it a chapter. That's the truth. Let's turn the page on
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.880]  this one. There was a, somebody we were going to say something to at the end, right? Oh no. I'd
[37:57.880 --> 38:01.320]  give a shout out to somebody at the end of every episode. Oh, that's my bad. Yeah. No, I gotcha. I
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.320]  gotcha. Uh, Clint was polite enough to watch me write down Patreon shout out names and then
[38:05.320 --> 38:09.160]  I looked to see who we were going to give a shout out to on the show. Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:09.160 --> 38:13.880]  uh, first of all, I want to thank everybody for listening. Dude. Episode 500 is coming up next.
[38:13.880 --> 38:18.200]  Yes. If everything works well, we've got Clint, we got double door dank and we got cracker Mike
[38:18.200 --> 38:21.800]  coming on the show. He loves it when I call him cracker Mike, by the way. Oh yeah. Yeah. We do
[38:21.800 --> 38:25.480]  that to his face all the time. Don't do that. If you see Mike at the end, no Expo, call him Mike,
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.240]  call him white Mike. Say what's up to white Mike. We hope to see you at the end of Expo. Clint will
[38:29.240 --> 38:33.720]  be at the Expo. I'll be there. Come shake my hand. Episode 500 coming up. Uh, we've got the
[38:33.720 --> 38:38.120]  endo Expo coming up. Big thanks to everybody for supporting the show. Uh, Clint, thank you for
[38:38.120 --> 38:41.400]  coming over, bro. Hey, no problem. Thanks for having me on, man. Oh man. It was a good time.
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.240]  Took up your time two nights in a row. Now, you know, we're having a good time, brother. That's
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.440]  what we're doing. If you're not having fun, what the fuck are you doing? You know, that's just what
[38:48.440 --> 38:52.440]  we're doing with our lives. That's it. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,

[39:49.720 --> 39:54.840]  it up in more people's recommended shows. Then they watch it. Easier to find in search engine.
[39:54.840 --> 39:58.840]  Then they learn how to grow better cannabis so that when you go out and you go to parties,
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.280]  or you go to a concert, the guy passing you weed may have learned how to grow it from us.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.320]  Or at least a credible source. Hopefully we gave them some inspiration where
[40:07.960 --> 40:11.080]  a book to read or something like that. So it was something.
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.680]  Hopefully we can improve everybody's garden. We're working on it, man. Let's help out.
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.120]  Also, if you've got any grow questions or cannabis culture or cultivation questions,

[40:55.080 --> 40:58.840]  who's on a podcast with me on another show and he'll have the greatest fucking points and he'll
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.520]  be going and he'll realize that he's been talking. I think he's got a timer. He's got like a three
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.040]  minute sand timer. And when it runs out, he's I'm still talking. I'm sorry you guys go ahead.
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.040]  And I'm like, bro, like you were saying great shit. Why did you just like, yeah, big shout

[41:30.120 --> 41:33.640]  relevant again. Hey, let's do it. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. I think that is all

[42:41.500 --> 42:45.260]  I just sleep all day.
[43:12.460 --> 43:26.080]  I'm just gonna turn on my little blue box and let it drag around my head. Well she said it's like
[43:26.080 --> 43:36.080]  ball music, ball music. It's just like ball music. I wonder why. It's ostentatiously isolated.
[43:37.040 --> 43:47.040]  It's just like ball music. I wonder why. It's ostentatiously isolated.
[43:47.040 --> 44:01.040]  Forever on fast forward. It's Wednesday afternoon folks. Ball is the porn. Tuesday afternoon. Ball is the porn. Monday afternoon. Ball is the porn. Sunday afternoon.
[44:06.080 --> 44:08.640]  Ball is the porn.
[44:36.640 --> 45:26.840]  You're riding slow motion. Kansas City's our destination.
[45:27.400 --> 45:31.400]  Well I'm trying to make those connections.
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.400]  But my mind's on something else.
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.400]  She said I just sleep all day, sleep all day.
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.400]  Well I just sleep all day.
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.400]  Well you can try to wake me up, you can try.
[45:47.400 --> 45:49.400]  And I'm used to summer night.
[45:49.960 --> 45:51.960]  Man, man driving.
