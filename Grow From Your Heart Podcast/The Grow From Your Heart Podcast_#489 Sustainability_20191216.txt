[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  Yo, what's up internet world?
[00:01.680 --> 00:07.840]  It is Rasta Jeff and it's time for episode 489 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:07.840 --> 00:11.600]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:11.600 --> 00:16.580]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:16.580 --> 00:24.440]  Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:24.440 --> 00:27.840]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:27.840 --> 00:33.080]  Today I've been taking dabs of First Class Funk Live Batter from our friends at Green
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.080]  Dot Labs.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.060]  This is a blend of GMO and jet fuel gelato.
[00:37.060 --> 00:41.640]  On the package, the flavor is described as hashy grape, fuel, and garlic.
[00:41.640 --> 00:44.520]  I'm going to say that that is completely accurate.
[00:44.520 --> 00:49.180]  There is a fuel and garlic aroma and then as you exhale, that hashy grape sort of lingers
[00:49.180 --> 00:50.180]  on your tongue.
[00:50.180 --> 00:53.260]  So great description, great buzz, great concentrate.
[00:53.260 --> 01:00.260]  On the back of the package, it says that the product contains 68.77% THC and non-detectable
[01:00.260 --> 01:01.260]  CBD.
[01:01.260 --> 01:07.420]  I really enjoy the flavor, aroma, and the buzz from the First Class Funk Live Batter.
[01:07.420 --> 01:11.140]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:11.140 --> 01:14.800]  In this episode, I'm going to read an email from a long-time listener.
[01:14.800 --> 01:18.520]  Before we get there, let's do a shout out to a few of the folks who support the show
[01:18.520 --> 01:20.360]  on Patreon.
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.340]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[01:24.340 --> 01:26.060]  our friend Jacob W.
[01:26.060 --> 01:28.980]  Let's send a big thank you shout out and a high five to James Brown.
[01:28.980 --> 01:31.720]  How about a big thank you shout out to Keith K.
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.860]  I'd like to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Todd K.
[01:35.860 --> 01:38.180]  Also a giant thank you shout out to JM.
[01:38.180 --> 01:41.180]  Of course, I always need to send a thank you to Blackbird.
[01:41.180 --> 01:44.500]  Let's send a big fat Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you and a fist
[01:44.500 --> 01:46.180]  bump to Zoso J.
[01:46.180 --> 01:48.620]  Of course, we need to send a big shout out to Tommy.

[01:52.360 --> 01:53.360]  to Brett G.
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.760]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big thank you shout out to my friend
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.720]  Stabby McStabwood.

[02:23.380 --> 02:25.840]  Now let's jump into that email I said I was going to read.
[02:25.840 --> 02:29.820]  This one comes from a long time listener, someone who I also consider a friend.
[02:29.820 --> 02:31.660]  This one comes from our friend Zane Decker.
[02:31.660 --> 02:32.660]  Big shout out to Zane.
[02:32.660 --> 02:33.660]  It's good to hear from you, buddy.
[02:33.660 --> 02:35.320]  I hope you're doing well.
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.420]  The message from Zane goes just like this.
[02:39.420 --> 02:44.640]  Canada is taking off with sustainable cannabis growing, utilizing aquaponics.
[02:44.640 --> 02:49.380]  What companies in Colorado can I support that are using sustainable techniques?
[02:49.380 --> 02:55.020]  And furthermore, what sustainability techniques do you use or would you recommend for commercial
[02:55.020 --> 02:57.020]  or home use?
[02:57.020 --> 02:58.340]  Thanks for your time, brother.
[02:58.340 --> 03:00.180]  Keep slinging that green thingy.
[03:00.180 --> 03:02.460]  They did not sign it, but I know who it's from.
[03:02.460 --> 03:03.940]  Big shout out to our buddy Zane.
[03:03.940 --> 03:04.940]  Thanks for the great message.
[03:04.940 --> 03:09.620]  Zane, this is a great question, and I'm glad you brought this to our attention.
[03:09.620 --> 03:12.220]  Let's talk a little bit about sustainability.
[03:12.220 --> 03:15.880]  There's so many different things to touch on when it comes to sustainably growing and
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.800]  producing cannabis, especially when it comes to commercial production.
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.280]  There is a lot of waste in the production, and there is an excessive amount of waste
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.560]  in the packaging.
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.600]  Let's talk a little bit about sustainability and commercial growing in Colorado.
[03:29.600 --> 03:32.320]  Let's first talk about this first question that Zane asked.
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.280]  It says, what companies in Colorado can I support that are using sustainable techniques?
[03:37.340 --> 03:43.420]  Unfortunately, I cannot tell you off the top of my head any companies that boast or brag
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.580]  about using sustainable techniques.
[03:45.580 --> 03:47.860]  There are a few no-till grows.
[03:47.860 --> 03:52.200]  There are a few boutique-style grows that are trying to do it sustainably.
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.420]  But most of the commercial grows in Colorado, in my experience, are turn and burn waste
[03:57.420 --> 03:58.420]  machines.
[03:58.420 --> 03:59.820]  They want plants on the ground.
[03:59.820 --> 04:01.280]  They want those plants in flower.
[04:01.280 --> 04:02.280]  They want them harvested.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.420]  They want them processed.
[04:03.420 --> 04:05.900]  They want them turned into whatever product they're going to.
[04:05.900 --> 04:06.900]  They need that on the shelf.
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.040]  They want the money to come back so they can pay to repeat that cycle.
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.560]  So unfortunately, I cannot point you directly to any companies in Colorado that are working
[04:16.560 --> 04:18.560]  on sustainability.
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.000]  So then he follows up with, furthermore, what sustainability techniques do you use or would
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.400]  you recommend for commercial or home use?
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.080]  That is a great way to follow this up.
[04:29.080 --> 04:30.840]  I try to be mindful.
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.200]  Being mindful is the first step to being sustainable.
[04:34.200 --> 04:36.360]  And I will admit that I am a salt grower.
[04:36.360 --> 04:37.860]  I am not an organics guy.
[04:37.860 --> 04:39.040]  That is just not my method.
[04:39.040 --> 04:40.100]  That is not my technique.
[04:40.100 --> 04:41.660]  That is not how I learned how to do it.
[04:41.660 --> 04:43.300]  That's not how I prefer to do it.
[04:43.300 --> 04:47.220]  If you like going full organic, if you like growing no-till, do that.
[04:47.220 --> 04:50.940]  Grow the way that makes you happy and don't bitch at other people for doing it the way
[04:50.940 --> 04:52.420]  that works for them.
[04:52.420 --> 04:54.940]  But I do understand that I am having nutrients.
[04:54.940 --> 04:58.220]  I'm having salts shipped across the country for my grow.
[04:58.220 --> 04:59.220]  I understand that.
[04:59.220 --> 05:00.740]  But I try to be mindful.
[05:00.740 --> 05:02.540]  There are a lot of things to think about.
[05:02.540 --> 05:04.940]  I try to think about how many lights I've got running.
[05:04.940 --> 05:07.320]  Do I need all of these lights on?
[05:07.320 --> 05:11.080]  In most situations, I'm working in very large environments.
[05:11.080 --> 05:17.600]  And I'm talking 100 or 500 lights in flower at a time, which gives me 100 to 200 veg lights,
[05:17.600 --> 05:19.520]  sometimes more than that.
[05:19.520 --> 05:24.520]  Sometimes if we can move this row of plants over here and turn off four lights for a week,
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.120]  that'll save us a little bit of money and that helps environmentally and that keeps
[05:28.120 --> 05:30.120]  us a little bit more sustainable.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.580]  So I think about lighting.
[05:31.580 --> 05:34.800]  When it comes with lighting, we also have less HVAC to run.
[05:34.820 --> 05:38.420]  If I'm not running that many lights, I don't need that much HVAC.
[05:38.420 --> 05:43.080]  So those are a couple of things that I look at immediately when I go into a grow to find
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.260]  ways to cut costs.
[05:44.260 --> 05:48.980]  One of my jobs is to cut costs in the grow as well as increase productivity.
[05:48.980 --> 05:53.500]  So I find ways to turn off a few lights by pushing a few plants closer together.
[05:53.500 --> 05:54.660]  Just be mindful.
[05:54.660 --> 05:55.660]  Think about what you're doing.
[05:55.660 --> 05:57.380]  Think about what you're seeing.
[05:57.380 --> 06:00.220]  Another thing to be mindful about is nutrients.
[06:00.220 --> 06:04.320]  I just said I know I'm having my nutrients shipped across the country.
[06:04.340 --> 06:08.140]  I have shifted to mostly powdered nutrients.
[06:08.140 --> 06:11.820]  Many of the nutrients we are purchasing that are in bottles are mostly water.
[06:11.820 --> 06:14.780]  So we are paying to have water driven across the country.
[06:14.780 --> 06:16.980]  We're paying shipping for water.
[06:16.980 --> 06:20.820]  So if you can buy powdered nutrients, I would suggest a powdered nutrient.
[06:20.820 --> 06:25.020]  Again, I understand that we've got the things we like and the methods we prefer.
[06:25.020 --> 06:26.740]  I like new millennium nutrients.
[06:26.740 --> 06:28.460]  Those are not powdered nutrients.
[06:28.460 --> 06:30.020]  I also like veg bloom.
[06:30.020 --> 06:31.580]  They are powdered nutrients.
[06:31.600 --> 06:34.760]  I understand that people like different things and we have different preferences.
[06:34.760 --> 06:38.120]  You just have to use your mind and think about do you want to pay for the shipping?
[06:38.120 --> 06:39.600]  Is this good for the environment?
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.480]  Is this going to be cost effective?
[06:41.480 --> 06:44.300]  So that's the next thing I think about is shipping.
[06:44.300 --> 06:47.000]  Everything has to be put on a truck and sent to us.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.040]  Most of the things we use are not locally made.
[06:50.040 --> 06:53.720]  I try to source things that are at least in Colorado.
[06:53.720 --> 06:57.720]  Oftentimes I have to have stuff sent from California or other regions, but I try to
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.760]  get most of my stuff from Colorado.
[06:59.780 --> 07:03.300]  So be mindful of shipping and shipping costs.
[07:03.300 --> 07:08.460]  I also work on sustainability by working on what is known as best practices.
[07:08.460 --> 07:11.020]  What are the best practices in your commercial?
[07:11.020 --> 07:13.460]  What is your culture in your grow environment?
[07:13.460 --> 07:17.920]  What are you doing in your environment, in your grow, in your facility to make sure you
[07:17.920 --> 07:21.560]  are leaving as little footprint on our planet as possible?
[07:21.560 --> 07:22.560]  What are you doing?
[07:22.560 --> 07:24.180]  What is in your employee handbook?
[07:24.180 --> 07:29.420]  What is in your standard operating procedure that helps you protect yourself and the environment?
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.080]  Think about those sorts of things.
[07:31.080 --> 07:34.040]  There are a lot of things in your grow that you can adjust.
[07:34.040 --> 07:38.040]  Like I said earlier, the first things in most grows I go to, I look at how many lights are
[07:38.040 --> 07:40.400]  on and how many plants are under each light.
[07:40.400 --> 07:45.540]  And can we simply move a few plants over 10 feet and turn off a whole entire row of lights?
[07:45.540 --> 07:49.540]  Those are things that each grow will have something like that you can look at.
[07:49.540 --> 07:53.640]  Is there a huge leak where your HVAC is just blowing fresh air right out of the building
[07:53.640 --> 07:55.740]  and wasting all that cool air you just put in there?
[07:55.740 --> 07:59.240]  Are you pumping CO2 out as you exhaust the room?
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.060]  Things like that.
[08:01.060 --> 08:02.060]  Look at your best practices.
[08:02.060 --> 08:03.060]  How are you mixing your nutrients?
[08:03.060 --> 08:04.060]  Are you wasting water?
[08:04.060 --> 08:05.740]  Are you wasting nutrients?
[08:05.740 --> 08:08.740]  Another important thing is pesticide safety.
[08:08.740 --> 08:09.740]  Are you handling?
[08:09.740 --> 08:10.740]  Are you mixing?
[08:10.740 --> 08:15.580]  Are you applying pesticides safely, especially in an outdoor environment?
[08:15.580 --> 08:16.720]  Where is that going?
[08:16.720 --> 08:20.180]  You may be aiming at the cannabis plant directly in front of you.
[08:20.180 --> 08:22.700]  Where is the wind taking the rest of that pesticide?
[08:22.700 --> 08:25.900]  Is it blowing on the orchard down the row from you?
[08:25.900 --> 08:26.900]  Where is it going?
[08:26.900 --> 08:28.540]  Be mindful of that sort of stuff.
[08:28.840 --> 08:30.360]  That stuff is very important.
[08:30.360 --> 08:32.600]  You may want to destroy the bugs in your crop.
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.960]  I don't want you destroying the bugs on my property.
[08:34.960 --> 08:36.080]  I don't have a cannabis farm.
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.080]  I've got other plants that are natural and local to my area.
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.340]  I don't know what your pesticide is going to do to those plants out there in my beautiful
[08:43.340 --> 08:47.720]  looking yard, to my desirable insects that are out there taking care of my yard, having
[08:47.720 --> 08:49.560]  a little nature like they should be.
[08:49.560 --> 08:52.160]  I understand we got to get rid of the bugs on the cannabis.
[08:52.160 --> 08:53.440]  Don't get rid of the bugs in my yard.
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.480]  I like them there.
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.280]  So be mindful with your pesticide applications.
[08:58.420 --> 09:02.260]  This is really going to be contradictory to the last thing I said.
[09:02.260 --> 09:07.300]  We have to wear gloves and personal protective equipment when we're in the grow at all times,
[09:07.300 --> 09:12.580]  especially when handling pesticides and other chemicals or whatever you want to call them.
[09:12.580 --> 09:16.060]  But try to not waste a bunch of gloves.
[09:16.060 --> 09:18.260]  Be mindful of how many gloves you were using.
[09:18.260 --> 09:22.340]  In a commercial environment, we can go through a box of gloves in a day.
[09:22.340 --> 09:25.820]  If there are one or two guys wearing the same size gloves, you think about it.
[09:25.820 --> 09:27.500]  You come in, you put on a pair of gloves.
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.360]  You do a job and you probably change gloves and use the men's room.
[09:31.360 --> 09:33.400]  You wash your hands, you come back, you put on another gloves.
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.800]  You're already at two pairs of gloves, two pair of gloves before the first break of the day.
[09:37.800 --> 09:39.160]  Then we go to break.
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.640]  You take a break, you do whatever you do at break.
[09:40.640 --> 09:42.680]  You come back, you put on more gloves.
[09:42.680 --> 09:43.960]  Hopefully you're working hard.
[09:43.960 --> 09:44.960]  Maybe you break a glove.
[09:44.960 --> 09:46.520]  You got to put on more gloves.
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.600]  I think we go between five and 12 pair of gloves per person per day in a commercial
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.760]  environment and that can add up quite quickly.
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.620]  Don't look at that much wasted latex in a pile and think about, first of all, how much
[09:59.620 --> 10:01.040]  latex you're throwing away.
[10:01.040 --> 10:02.780]  You're putting that into a landfill.
[10:02.780 --> 10:05.220]  Then also that had to be shipped to you.
[10:05.220 --> 10:08.460]  So you're wasting stuff two times when we're wasting too many gloves.
[10:08.460 --> 10:12.180]  I understand we have to use that stuff, but be mindful.
[10:12.180 --> 10:17.180]  And another thing we need to be more mindful of is the wasting of water.
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.180]  Don't get me wrong.
[10:18.180 --> 10:22.860]  I have overflowed a reservoir in every single grow in which I have worked.
[10:22.860 --> 10:26.840]  I'm not trying to say I don't do it, but we all need to pay more attention to the amount
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.320]  of water we are using and wasting in our commercial environments.
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.240]  After we water a room a few times, we should know how many gallons of water that room needs.
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.960]  We should not mix up too much.
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.200]  We should not be throwing away excess nutrient solution.
[10:42.200 --> 10:44.800]  And if you were throwing that away, where is it going?
[10:44.800 --> 10:47.840]  Where are you dumping your excess nutrient solution?
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.160]  Be mindful of that.
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.260]  If you are running a drain to waste system where you've got runoff water, where is that
[10:53.260 --> 10:54.260]  water going?
[10:54.260 --> 10:56.060]  Is that going in a floor drain?
[10:56.060 --> 10:59.220]  I know that once it hits the floor drain, that's out of your mind, but where does it
[10:59.220 --> 11:00.860]  go after that?
[11:00.860 --> 11:05.500]  If you've got to take some water and dump it out back or dump it somewhere in your facility,
[11:05.500 --> 11:06.580]  where is that water going?
[11:06.580 --> 11:09.980]  Is that going right into the drain that runs back to the river?
[11:09.980 --> 11:11.760]  Is that going to some sort of recycling?
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.380]  Is that just draining right into the dirt right in your area?
[11:15.380 --> 11:19.920]  Are all the bushes outside of your grow growing rapidly and you can't figure out why?
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.400]  Because you're dumping all that nutrient water out there?
[11:22.400 --> 11:23.680]  Are the bunnies eating that?
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.760]  Are you destroying the natural environment that should be out there?
[11:26.760 --> 11:28.400]  Be mindful of that sort of stuff.
[11:28.400 --> 11:30.240]  Let's not waste too much water.
[11:30.240 --> 11:32.840]  I'm getting thirsty just talking about wasting water.
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.120]  One day we may run out of water and when we do, we are fucked.
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.400]  So be mindful how much water you are mixing when you're mixing a nutrient solution.
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.600]  Be mindful if you're filling a reservoir.
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.660]  Just set a timer and don't let that shit overflow onto the floor.
[11:47.660 --> 11:51.540]  And if you are running a drain to waste or if you're disposing of some sort of water,
[11:51.540 --> 11:53.880]  be mindful of where that water is going.
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.180]  Like I said before, out of sight, out of mind, right?
[11:56.180 --> 11:59.100]  Once it goes down the drain, who cares what happens to it?
[11:59.100 --> 12:02.780]  You probably should care what happens once it goes down the drain.
[12:02.780 --> 12:08.140]  So the main tips I can give about being more sustainable are basically being more mindful
[12:08.140 --> 12:10.100]  and being aware of what we're doing.
[12:10.100 --> 12:12.940]  Just simple steps that we may not have paid attention to.
[12:12.940 --> 12:15.520]  Try to recycle more appropriately if possible.
[12:15.520 --> 12:17.020]  Try not to waste.
[12:17.020 --> 12:20.340]  Waste is a big cost in the grow environment.
[12:20.340 --> 12:23.820]  Waste is a big cost to our environment in general.
[12:23.820 --> 12:28.580]  Now let's kind of work into some things we can do on a larger scale that will help us
[12:28.580 --> 12:30.660]  be more sustainable.
[12:30.660 --> 12:35.100]  And of course, the first obvious things to help us be more sustainable would be to grow
[12:35.100 --> 12:36.820]  outdoors.
[12:36.820 --> 12:40.580]  Outdoors is much more cost effective than an indoor grow.
[12:40.580 --> 12:42.480]  You don't have to pay for lights.
[12:42.520 --> 12:45.600]  The sun is the best natural light ever.
[12:45.600 --> 12:46.720]  That's why it's there.
[12:46.720 --> 12:51.000]  That's how everything started is it all grew because the sun gave it light and life.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.320]  So use the sun.
[12:52.320 --> 12:53.320]  It is free.
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.560]  Then, if you're growing outdoors, you don't have to add an air conditioner because you're
[12:57.560 --> 12:58.560]  outdoors.
[12:58.560 --> 13:00.640]  You can't air condition the entire outdoors.
[13:00.640 --> 13:01.920]  Those plants have to deal with it.
[13:01.920 --> 13:04.000]  Now you're not wasting HVAC.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.040]  That's that much more chemical gas that is not being released into our environment.
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.860]  We're getting better already.
[13:09.860 --> 13:11.920]  Now I understand we can't all grow outdoors.
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  I'm in Colorado.
[13:12.920 --> 13:14.800]  My outdoor grow season is very limited.
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.120]  We build greenhouses and hang lights in them.
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.560]  We use the sunshine when we can.
[13:18.560 --> 13:20.600]  We supplement with grow lights as needed.
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.900]  So I understand we can't all grow outdoors.
[13:22.900 --> 13:25.240]  This is an ideal world.
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.720]  Now if you are forced to use grow lights, what would be a most helpful option would
[13:29.720 --> 13:30.840]  be solar.
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.920]  The only problem with that is it costs a little bit of money to install solar.
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.600]  You've got to put the money out up front.
[13:36.600 --> 13:38.800]  Then it's got to pay for itself over time.
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.200]  A lot of companies, a lot of environments, a lot of situations cannot afford to put the
[13:43.200 --> 13:45.280]  money for solar out right up front.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.880]  So grow outdoors.
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.540]  You don't have to pay for lighting.
[13:48.540 --> 13:49.540]  Grow outdoors.
[13:49.540 --> 13:50.880]  You don't have to pay for air conditioning.
[13:50.880 --> 13:54.320]  If we move indoors, let's try to utilize the power of solar.
[13:54.320 --> 13:58.220]  That way we can take that energy from the sun and we can still power our plants with
[13:58.220 --> 14:00.640]  that natural sun energy.
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.420]  Now when it comes to solar, we have to do our research because does it cost more damage
[14:04.420 --> 14:08.720]  to the environment to make those solar panels than it does to actually run the electricity?
[14:08.720 --> 14:12.600]  There's a lot of thinking to be done when it comes to designing big facilities and
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.880]  trying to set up solar and trying to think ethically and trying to put your money somewhere
[14:16.880 --> 14:19.720]  where you're not causing more problems.
[14:19.720 --> 14:23.540]  So obviously growing outdoors would be our first step to sustainability.
[14:23.540 --> 14:28.280]  The next step to becoming more sustainable and environmentally friendly would be to run
[14:28.280 --> 14:31.080]  some sort of a no-till type of environment.
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.860]  A no-till environment would give you much less waste and waste is a huge problem in
[14:36.860 --> 14:38.440]  a commercial facility.
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.680]  Imagine if I've got a room with 200 three-gallon pots filled with cocoa, we harvest.
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.080]  Now I've got a dumpster filled with three-gallon pots filled with cocoa.
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.040]  If we were running no-till, we would basically pull out the main root ball, we would put
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.760]  in another plant, backfill with some compost, and we would be good to go.
[14:56.760 --> 14:58.960]  There would be very minimal waste.
[14:58.960 --> 15:02.600]  We could actually throw that root ball and that leftover stick and probably most of my
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.400]  other sticks and all my trim right into my compost bin and it would become food again
[15:07.400 --> 15:09.200]  for my plants in the future.
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.440]  That is a much more sustainable way to operate a grow.
[15:13.440 --> 15:18.280]  Unfortunately in my experience, it is much more difficult to operate a commercial environment
[15:18.280 --> 15:20.480]  in a no-till type of setup.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.680]  I'm sure people are doing it.
[15:21.680 --> 15:24.560]  I'm sure they kick ass at it, but it is not my style.
[15:24.560 --> 15:25.920]  I am not good at that.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.560]  I am a salt grower.
[15:27.560 --> 15:29.240]  I'm a bottled nutrients grower.
[15:29.240 --> 15:30.720]  I set up a drip system.
[15:30.720 --> 15:36.080]  I know how to train guys where they can feed these nutrients to these plants at this week
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.360]  and I can train them to do that in multiple facilities and I'm going to get the same outcome
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.080]  in multiple environments.
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.240]  That is why I like my regimen.
[15:44.240 --> 15:47.560]  But going full no-till, going fully organic would be much more sustainable.
[15:47.560 --> 15:50.400]  It would be much more environmentally friendly.
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.400]  It would be fully organic, which is already a headstart.
[15:53.400 --> 15:55.600]  You don't have to ship all of those bottles.
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.920]  That's a big advantage and there is much less waste.
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.340]  And like I said a minute ago, most of the waste from a no-till grow can be put right
[16:04.340 --> 16:06.460]  back into the compost bin.
[16:06.460 --> 16:10.740]  It will become composted and you can use it right back on the plants in the future and
[16:10.740 --> 16:14.340]  that will feed your plants again and keep that cycle going.
[16:14.340 --> 16:17.420]  There is very minimal waste in that type of a setup.
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.780]  So my first tips to becoming more sustainable would be to learn to grow outdoors.
[16:21.780 --> 16:23.740]  That is much more environmentally friendly.
[16:23.740 --> 16:26.880]  I understand that is not always everybody's option.
[16:26.880 --> 16:32.840]  The next step would be to learn to grow no-till or at least fully organically and stop shipping
[16:32.840 --> 16:34.920]  bottles around the country.
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.880]  The next steps to learning to grow more sustainable are being mindful in your environment.
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.680]  What can you do in your grow situation to save some tread on the earth and also save
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.120]  some tread on your wallet?
[16:48.120 --> 16:49.920]  They will go very well together.
[16:49.920 --> 16:53.240]  They'll both make you feel very good about your choices.
[16:53.240 --> 16:57.000]  So when you're in your grow and you're mixing your nutrients or you're applying your pesticide
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.160]  or you're doing whatever you're in your grow doing, be mindful.
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.280]  Don't say, oh, right there, I'm probably fucking up the environment just a little bit more
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.360]  than I need to.
[17:05.360 --> 17:09.560]  I could probably dial back my footprint just a little bit just by skipping that step or
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.600]  by maybe doing this one extra step.
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.100]  So just be more mindful in your garden, pay more attention to what you're doing and look
[17:16.100 --> 17:22.240]  for opportunities to be more gentle on the environment and also more gentle on your wallet.
[17:22.240 --> 17:26.800]  Now let's talk about another thing that I find to be completely embarrassing about the
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.000]  Colorado legal cannabis industry.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.440]  One of the most wasteful things you could ever find is cannabis packaging in Colorado.
[17:35.440 --> 17:39.960]  If you buy a pre-rolled joint, it comes in a tube that is about six inches long and an
[17:39.960 --> 17:43.680]  inch in diameter and it's got a label on it from the company.
[17:43.680 --> 17:45.200]  This is a whatever joint.
[17:45.200 --> 17:49.840]  And then once you purchase it, the dispensary is required to put a sticker on it that says
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.200]  that it was grown at this place, it was rolled at this place, it was sold at this place and
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.240]  it was bought by this person.
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.220]  Then it's got to be sold to you in some sort of a childproof container.
[17:59.220 --> 18:03.780]  If that tube isn't already childproof, they've got to put it in an exit bag or another childproof
[18:03.780 --> 18:04.780]  container.
[18:04.780 --> 18:07.580]  Then they probably throw that into a brown paper bag.
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.180]  Then they give you a receipt.
[18:09.180 --> 18:12.260]  Then they usually give you some sort of a pamphlet about a new product that's coming
[18:12.260 --> 18:15.820]  out that you do not care about because you just bought the product that you enjoy.
[18:15.820 --> 18:18.320]  Then they high five you and tell you to have a good day.
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.100]  Then most of us get to the car and we throw away all of that packaging.
[18:22.100 --> 18:25.640]  All we need is that pre-rolled joint that was in that tube and a lighter.
[18:25.640 --> 18:28.180]  We don't need any of the other bullshit.
[18:28.180 --> 18:34.220]  Every product in Colorado comes with excessive, ridiculously wasteful packaging.
[18:34.220 --> 18:38.820]  Many of the concentrate companies will sell you a gram of concentrate, but that gram of
[18:38.820 --> 18:44.500]  concentrate will be inside of a fancy cardboard box with a lot of fancy labeling.
[18:44.500 --> 18:49.220]  You open the top of that cardboard box and there is a small, like a jewelry pouch, something
[18:49.220 --> 18:53.380]  that a hippie would keep their little magic rocks in, a little tiny Crown Royal bag.
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.860]  You've got a cardboard box.
[18:54.860 --> 18:56.140]  I crack that open.
[18:56.420 --> 18:58.260]  Now there's a little Crown Royal bag in there.
[18:58.260 --> 18:59.900]  I crack that open.
[18:59.900 --> 19:01.460]  Both of those immediately go in the trash.
[19:01.460 --> 19:02.540]  Fuck that Crown Royal bag.
[19:02.540 --> 19:03.660]  Fuck that cardboard box.
[19:03.660 --> 19:05.300]  Do not need that for anything.
[19:05.300 --> 19:08.140]  Now inside is a little glass container.
[19:08.140 --> 19:11.420]  It's a little tiny container that weighs, I'm going to drop it on the table so you can
[19:11.420 --> 19:13.980]  hear how heavy these containers are.
[19:13.980 --> 19:18.340]  That was one hash container for one gram of concentrate.
[19:18.340 --> 19:20.100]  I don't need that much packaging.
[19:20.100 --> 19:22.300]  I know that there's a gram of hash in here.
[19:22.300 --> 19:24.220]  Just a little container would have been just fine.
[19:24.300 --> 19:26.540]  I don't need all of this packaging.
[19:26.540 --> 19:28.740]  Then they put this in a brown paper bag.
[19:28.740 --> 19:33.020]  They put stickers on it to show where it was purchased, who purchased it, what time I purchased
[19:33.020 --> 19:34.020]  it.
[19:34.020 --> 19:35.020]  Then I've got a receipt.
[19:35.020 --> 19:37.260]  There is so much bullshit coming along with this one gram.
[19:37.260 --> 19:41.380]  I wish I could get a little container and put it in my pocket and say, thanks bro.
[19:41.380 --> 19:42.380]  Have a great day.
[19:42.380 --> 19:44.580]  I don't need all of the extra shit to throw away.
[19:44.580 --> 19:45.980]  I don't need the paper trail.
[19:45.980 --> 19:47.340]  There's no need for all of that.
[19:47.340 --> 19:51.940]  I wish that Colorado did not require all of the ridiculous packaging.
[19:51.940 --> 19:53.860]  Everything has to be childproof.
[19:54.020 --> 19:56.220]  Everything has to be ridiculously labeled.
[19:56.220 --> 20:00.300]  Sometimes I think that the packages are only this big so we can fit all of the requirements
[20:00.300 --> 20:01.300]  on here.
[20:01.300 --> 20:04.940]  We have to have a small billboard for all of our requirements on our packaging.
[20:04.940 --> 20:10.460]  When you are creating legislation in your area, please be mindful of all of the packaging
[20:10.460 --> 20:15.540]  requirements in Colorado and how embarrassingly wasteful this has become.
[20:15.540 --> 20:17.300]  I was just looking at the products on my table.
[20:17.300 --> 20:21.520]  I've got a couple of vape cartridges from a very well-known company.
[20:21.520 --> 20:25.680]  You guys know whose vape carts I will smoke and whose I will not consume.
[20:25.680 --> 20:27.880]  This company is required, this is not their fault.
[20:27.880 --> 20:31.620]  This is the requirement of the state for a vape cartridge.
[20:31.620 --> 20:35.680]  This thing is probably, I'm unscrewing it from the battery now to get a good idea of
[20:35.680 --> 20:38.920]  what size this, this is probably, it's smaller than my pinky.
[20:38.920 --> 20:42.640]  This thing is definitely smaller than my pinky, probably the size of the average person's
[20:42.640 --> 20:43.640]  pinky.
[20:43.640 --> 20:44.880]  This is about a pinky finger.
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.760]  The packaging that this comes in is about the size, bigger than a pack of cigarettes.
[20:49.760 --> 20:52.600]  It's a little bit bigger than a pack of cigarettes.
[20:52.600 --> 20:57.960]  This little tiny thing has got to come in something about the size of a package of cigarettes.
[20:57.960 --> 21:00.800]  Then you try to open that up and it's in a childproof pack.
[21:00.800 --> 21:01.880]  It's got this little press thing.
[21:01.880 --> 21:04.200]  You've got to press here, squeeze here, pull here.
[21:04.200 --> 21:07.440]  Honestly, I usually just end up tearing the packages apart because that shit only works
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.440]  half the time.
[21:08.440 --> 21:14.200]  Then on the inside, there's four or five things folded together to keep this little tiny product
[21:14.200 --> 21:15.200]  in place.
[21:15.320 --> 21:20.560]  They could have done this with very minimal packaging if Colorado did not require all
[21:20.560 --> 21:21.560]  of these.
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.760]  First of all, probably this billboard on the back of the package is part of it.
[21:24.760 --> 21:30.240]  Then all this childproof and this over excessive safety stuff, I don't think it's necessary.
[21:30.240 --> 21:33.760]  It reminds me of when I was young and I used to go to the record store and try to buy a
[21:33.760 --> 21:39.720]  cassette or a CD and you had to carry that giant contraption up to the front desk so
[21:39.720 --> 21:41.360]  that they could get your CD out of there.
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.960]  They had to put it in that little machine and try to break it out.
[21:43.960 --> 21:47.120]  That's kind of what it's like when you go to buy products in Colorado.
[21:47.120 --> 21:49.360]  There is a ridiculous amount of packaging.
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.680]  All right, Decker, I really got off on a ramble there.
[21:52.680 --> 21:57.000]  You asked what companies should you support in Colorado that are sustainable.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.480]  Unfortunately, I don't have any companies I can point you to directly that are more
[22:01.480 --> 22:02.480]  sustainable.
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.560]  Hopefully, people are listening to this episode and there are people that grows.
[22:06.560 --> 22:11.680]  There are people in facilities that are going to say, hey, Rasta Jeff, use us as an example.
[22:11.680 --> 22:12.680]  We grow sustainably.
[22:12.960 --> 22:13.960]  Here are some photos.
[22:13.960 --> 22:14.960]  Here's what we do.
[22:14.960 --> 22:15.960]  Give us a shout out.
[22:15.960 --> 22:16.960]  And I will.
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.960]  If you send me info that qualifies, I'll give you a shout out and say that you deserve a
[22:20.960 --> 22:22.760]  fist bump for being sustainable.
[22:22.760 --> 22:28.600]  Then you ask what techniques I could recommend for home or commercial use to make us more
[22:28.600 --> 22:29.600]  sustainable.
[22:29.600 --> 22:31.760]  I hope I gave you a lot of examples.
[22:31.760 --> 22:38.240]  Almost everything I said will apply in a commercial environment or in a small craft or home grow.
[22:38.240 --> 22:40.440]  They should apply all the way around.
[22:40.440 --> 22:43.440]  Mainly pay attention and be mindful.
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.260]  What are you doing in your grow?
[22:45.260 --> 22:48.960]  If you saw somebody else doing that, would you go, oh man, you're dumb?
[22:48.960 --> 22:51.240]  Or would you go, oh, that's the perfect way to do it.
[22:51.240 --> 22:52.760]  Watch yourself on camera.
[22:52.760 --> 22:55.120]  Watch yourself from the third person view.
[22:55.120 --> 22:58.480]  Just think about everything you were doing in your grow, everything you were doing in
[22:58.480 --> 23:01.200]  your outdoor, in your indoor, in your greenhouse.
[23:01.200 --> 23:02.200]  Think about it all.
[23:02.200 --> 23:06.840]  Pay attention and think about how you would react if I told you I was doing that in my
[23:06.840 --> 23:07.840]  grow.
[23:07.840 --> 23:11.440]  If I told you, oh, today I hung from a ladder and fucking held onto a light with one hand
[23:11.440 --> 23:15.080]  and applied pesticides without any personal protective equipment, you'd be like, bro,
[23:15.080 --> 23:16.400]  what the fuck are you doing?
[23:16.400 --> 23:19.640]  Think about it like you're telling me what you're doing in your grow and the look I'm
[23:19.640 --> 23:21.900]  going to give you when you tell me about it.
[23:21.900 --> 23:22.900]  There we go.
[23:22.900 --> 23:23.900]  That's a beautiful marketing idea.
[23:23.900 --> 23:28.080]  Let's make some of those plastic, what would Rasta Jeff do bracelets, maybe make some,
[23:28.080 --> 23:29.760]  what would Rasta Jeff do signs?
[23:29.760 --> 23:31.080]  We can hang those up in your grow.
[23:31.080 --> 23:33.840]  It'll remind you to always be a good grower.
[23:33.840 --> 23:34.840]  All right, podcast world.
[23:34.840 --> 23:37.920]  I feel like this episode was short and sweet, but I got right to the point.
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.200]  There's no need to ramble and try to extend this.
[23:40.200 --> 23:42.360]  I'm going to start wrapping up this episode right here.
[23:42.360 --> 23:44.080]  I want to thank you for listening.
[23:44.080 --> 23:46.960]  Big shout out to my buddy Decker for the great email.
[23:46.960 --> 23:51.480]  If anybody else out there has a question, a cannabis culture question, a cannabis cultivation
[23:51.480 --> 23:54.880]  question, maybe you'd like to sponsor the show, or maybe you've just got something you'd
[23:54.880 --> 23:59.240]  like to say, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:59.240 --> 24:01.280]  You know, I would love to hear from you.
[24:01.280 --> 24:04.240]  I also hope to see you at the Indo Expo in Denver.
[24:04.240 --> 24:08.880]  Let's write the Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado on January 25th and 26th.
[24:08.880 --> 24:13.480]  The 25th is industry day, but the 26th is open to the general public.
[24:13.480 --> 24:14.480]  I do hope to see you.
[24:14.480 --> 24:15.480]  I've got a booth.
[24:15.480 --> 24:20.520]  Stop by the booth, shake my hand, say hi, grab some iRegenetics, take a selfie with
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.520]  me.
[24:21.520 --> 24:22.520]  I hope to see you there.
[24:22.520 --> 24:27.920]  Do make sure you get your tickets before you travel because that event will sell out.
[24:27.920 --> 24:28.920]  Be prepared.
