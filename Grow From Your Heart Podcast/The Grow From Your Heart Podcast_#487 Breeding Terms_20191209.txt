[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  Need a new cool catchphrase or something.
[00:02.600 --> 00:05.840]  What's up ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[00:05.840 --> 00:07.840]  and growers, all you bad motherfuckers.
[00:07.840 --> 00:12.200]  Thank you for joining me for episode 487 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:12.200 --> 00:15.280]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:15.280 --> 00:19.840]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:19.840 --> 00:27.720]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:27.720 --> 00:31.160]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:31.160 --> 00:36.400]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Cutieberry Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:36.400 --> 00:39.460]  This is a blend of member berry and Tahitian punch.
[00:39.460 --> 00:44.040]  On the package, the flavor is described as citrus, berries, and frankincense.
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.480]  I think we've been over this before.
[00:45.480 --> 00:46.960]  I for sure get the citrus.
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.960]  I for sure get the berries.
[00:48.960 --> 00:50.520]  Not so sure about the frankincense.
[00:50.520 --> 00:53.840]  There's something funky in the background, something musty, something earthy.
[00:53.840 --> 00:55.920]  I'm not sure I would agree with frankincense.
[00:56.120 --> 00:59.160]  Either way, it is a delicious and highly potent concentrate.
[00:59.160 --> 01:06.240]  On the back of the package, the label says this product contains 67.39% THC and non-detectable
[01:06.240 --> 01:07.720]  amounts of CBD.
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.080]  I really approve of the Cutieberry Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.640]  Alright, in this episode, I'm going to answer an email that asks a question about breeding.
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.760]  Before we get there, you know I like to do some shoutouts to our friends on Patreon.
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.240]  We've got a few new friends.
[01:25.240 --> 01:28.680]  Let's start off with a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shoutout and a thank you to
[01:28.680 --> 01:30.080]  our new friend Karen Crawford.
[01:30.080 --> 01:32.760]  How about a giant thank you shoutout to Tanner M.
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.040]  Of course, I always want to send a giant thank you shoutout to Glenn G.
[01:36.040 --> 01:38.360]  I need to send a big thank you shoutout to Reefer Madness.
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.500]  Hey, by the way, Reefer Madness, congratulations on your first breeding project.
[01:42.500 --> 01:43.720]  That looks great.
[01:43.720 --> 01:46.280]  Let's continue on with a big thank you shoutout to Paul A.
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.680]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to give a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:50.680 --> 01:54.280]  high five, a shoutout, and a thank you to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.520]  Big thank you, big shoutout, big respect to everybody who has continued to support the
[01:58.520 --> 02:00.040]  show on Patreon.
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.120]  If you'd like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:06.120 --> 02:08.540]  forward slash growfromyourheart.
[02:08.540 --> 02:12.520]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:12.520 --> 02:16.400]  Alright, I think that covers the business part of the podcast.
[02:16.400 --> 02:19.100]  Let's jump into the email portion of the show.
[02:19.100 --> 02:22.760]  I was spending most of my evening packing up seeds for the Indo Expo.
[02:22.760 --> 02:27.600]  I will be at the Indo Expo in Denver on January 25th and 26th.
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.080]  The 25th is Industry and Professionals and Business to Business Day, but the 26th is
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.320]  open to the general public, so I do hope to see you there.
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.520]  Do get your tickets before you travel because it will sell out and come stock up on some
[02:39.520 --> 02:41.800]  fresh Irie genetics.
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.700]  Anyway, while I was packing up those seeds, I was thinking about an email that I recently
[02:46.700 --> 02:51.160]  received so I thought it might be a good time to take a break from packing up seeds, take
[02:51.320 --> 02:54.360]  way too many dabs, and then knock out a podcast.
[02:54.360 --> 03:00.260]  So let's jump into the email that inspired today's podcast episode.
[03:00.260 --> 03:03.920]  This email starts off with a question about LED lighting, but then it does work into a
[03:03.920 --> 03:05.120]  breeding question.
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.720]  I'm going to go quickly over the lighting question, but what I want to focus on this
[03:09.720 --> 03:11.820]  episode is the breeding question.
[03:11.820 --> 03:13.240]  So let's jump right into the email.
[03:13.240 --> 03:15.240]  It goes, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[03:15.240 --> 03:16.400]  Jeff with a G again.
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.240]  I hope this email finds you well.
[03:18.240 --> 03:19.240]  What's up Jeff with a G.
[03:19.240 --> 03:20.860]  Good to hear from you again.
[03:20.860 --> 03:25.280]  Jeff starts off by saying, the reason I am harassing today is about my first time actually
[03:25.280 --> 03:27.960]  making an honest attempt at growing.
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.780]  Your grow lesson compilation was the tits and it has inspired me to pull the trigger.
[03:32.780 --> 03:33.780]  That is awesome.
[03:33.780 --> 03:36.440]  I love hearing that you thought my grow lessons were the tits.
[03:36.440 --> 03:40.040]  I don't think anybody has ever told me that anything I've done was the tits before, so
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.300]  that's cool.
[03:41.300 --> 03:44.780]  But I am excited that you are now a grower and I am excited for you.
[03:44.780 --> 03:45.940]  Let's keep going with the message.
[03:45.940 --> 03:49.380]  It says, I scored an HBS lamp and two LEDs.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.820]  I've got a tent, a blower and a filter.
[03:51.820 --> 03:55.940]  I've got some heating pads for the floor and a couple of other things, all for $300.
[03:55.940 --> 03:57.960]  Man, that is a good deal.
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.740]  I do recommend you clean all of that equipment before you put any plants in there, but I
[04:01.740 --> 04:04.820]  think you've got a good setup for a good price so far.
[04:04.820 --> 04:08.380]  It goes on to say, I'm sorry that I don't have all of my specs right now.
[04:08.380 --> 04:11.220]  It's all in a pile in the basement currently.
[04:11.220 --> 04:12.700]  That's completely fair.
[04:12.700 --> 04:17.340]  The first question in the message is, I've listened to your filter placement episode,
[04:17.340 --> 04:22.780]  but I want to still ask if I'm good blowing directly into my basement, especially since
[04:22.780 --> 04:25.940]  I'm using the LEDs first.
[04:25.940 --> 04:27.580]  Now that is sort of an odd question.
[04:27.580 --> 04:29.940]  I'm not sure exactly what you were asking.
[04:29.940 --> 04:33.940]  I know that in a previous episode, I've talked about carbon filter placement.
[04:33.940 --> 04:38.020]  We want the air to pass through the carbon filter before it leaves our grow space so
[04:38.020 --> 04:41.540]  that wherever it goes, it doesn't have cannabis aroma in it.
[04:41.540 --> 04:44.620]  So where that air is nice and clean, so nobody smells our grow.
[04:44.620 --> 04:48.380]  It sounds like Jeff with a G wants to blow the air through the carbon filter out of his
[04:48.380 --> 04:52.060]  tent and directly into the basement, which is not a problem at all.
[04:52.060 --> 04:53.060]  That's a good idea.
[04:53.060 --> 04:56.080]  That's mainly what a lot of folks do who are growing in the basement.
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.840]  As long as that basement doesn't overheat, as long as you're able to get that heat out
[04:59.840 --> 05:03.900]  of there, or as long as it mixes with enough cool air to stabilize the temperature inside
[05:03.900 --> 05:06.680]  of that tent, that should be fine.
[05:06.680 --> 05:11.440]  It's the part about the LEDs that throws me off here, especially since I'm running the
[05:11.440 --> 05:12.680]  LEDs first.
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.120]  I don't know why that makes a difference.
[05:15.120 --> 05:18.120]  I'm not sure what you're questioning about that part.
[05:18.120 --> 05:23.440]  So send me another email and kind of clarify this question and I'll give you further advice.
[05:23.440 --> 05:26.640]  But this is a great email because I really like the second half.
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.560]  The second question is great and we're going to spend a lot more time focusing on here.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.200]  So I'm sorry I skipped over the first part.
[05:32.200 --> 05:35.540]  I'm not even sure what you're asking there, but the second part is gold.
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.540]  So let's get to that part.
[05:36.540 --> 05:41.460]  It says, also after a few sessions, I'd like to breed and create my own strains.
[05:41.460 --> 05:44.780]  Can I request an episode of breeding terms and methods?
[05:44.780 --> 05:49.220]  Some of it is a little esoteric at the moment and I'm getting ahead of myself, but I love
[05:49.220 --> 05:52.220]  learning about this plant, especially if you're the teacher.
[05:52.220 --> 05:53.940]  Hey, that means a lot to me.
[05:53.940 --> 05:58.060]  It also says I will have many more questions and updates in the future, but this is where
[05:58.060 --> 06:00.780]  I am thus far.
[06:00.780 --> 06:02.620]  Thanks in advance and keep blazing brother.
[06:02.620 --> 06:05.100]  Jeff with a G.
[06:05.100 --> 06:07.420]  I love the enthusiasm coming from Jeff with a G.
[06:07.420 --> 06:09.140]  He just got his grow equipment.
[06:09.140 --> 06:13.740]  It's not set up yet and he's already asking questions about when I breed, how do I do
[06:13.740 --> 06:15.100]  this correctly?
[06:15.100 --> 06:16.780]  You are getting a little bit ahead of yourself.
[06:16.780 --> 06:21.900]  You are absolutely correct there, but this is a good opportunity for me to talk about
[06:21.900 --> 06:24.420]  breeding and breeding labels.
[06:24.420 --> 06:28.620]  I'm not going to focus too much on breeding methods and too much of my tricks and techniques
[06:28.620 --> 06:30.480]  and stuff like that on this episode.
[06:30.480 --> 06:35.840]  I'd like to focus more on the labels and some of the wording that we see on seed packaging.
[06:35.840 --> 06:41.320]  I think that some of the companies use a lot of trickery and a lot of mislabeling and a
[06:41.320 --> 06:42.920]  lot of weird wordplay.
[06:42.920 --> 06:47.120]  And I'm not sure if these companies are doing it because they're trying to sell more seeds
[06:47.120 --> 06:51.360]  and they're trying to word things fancily so that the consumer is kind of fooled and
[06:51.360 --> 06:55.960]  wants to buy shit that sounds better, or if they really just, they don't know how to properly
[06:55.960 --> 06:59.160]  label it and those are the words that they chose for their packaging.
[06:59.160 --> 07:03.880]  So we see a lot of different things on packaging and oftentimes it all means the same shit.
[07:03.880 --> 07:06.040]  A lot of times it doesn't mean anything.
[07:06.040 --> 07:10.160]  So let's kind of talk about some of the things we see on seed packaging.
[07:10.160 --> 07:13.860]  And we may actually talk about some things that we do not see on seed packaging that
[07:13.860 --> 07:15.840]  should probably be there.
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.920]  Let's start off with some of the very basics, labeling.
[07:18.920 --> 07:21.240]  We will often see the name of the strain.
[07:21.240 --> 07:24.000]  Today I'm going to pick one of my strains because it's easy for me.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.480]  We're going to go with Arise.
[07:25.480 --> 07:28.280]  A lot of my listeners know that Arise is one of my favorites.
[07:28.280 --> 07:29.440]  I bred the Arise.
[07:29.440 --> 07:30.880]  I can talk about it freely.
[07:30.880 --> 07:33.280]  I know all of the details and I'm not going to be wrong.
[07:33.280 --> 07:36.360]  So let's pick Arise as our strain for the day.
[07:36.360 --> 07:39.800]  When I label Arise, I write Arise on the seed package.
[07:39.800 --> 07:40.800]  That's obvious.
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.360]  Now you know those are Arise seeds in there.
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.240]  Underneath Arise, in parentheses, I put Golden Goat X Daybreaker.
[07:49.240 --> 07:51.440]  And those are in parentheses together.
[07:51.440 --> 07:53.360]  Why did I put that there?
[07:53.360 --> 07:58.440]  Because Golden Goat is the female plant that was used to create Arise.
[07:58.440 --> 08:03.400]  And Daybreaker was the male plant that was used to create the Arise.
[08:03.400 --> 08:09.440]  Now you've got an idea of what the genetic parents of the seeds you have purchased are.
[08:09.440 --> 08:14.640]  That provides you a little bit of information as to how the plant will grow, possibly what
[08:14.640 --> 08:16.160]  it will taste like.
[08:16.160 --> 08:18.060]  It creates a little bit of familiarity.
[08:18.060 --> 08:21.360]  If you know what Golden Goat is, you know, ooh, I like Golden Goat.
[08:21.360 --> 08:24.200]  Or if you know what Daybreaker is, you say, ooh, I like Daybreaker.
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.000]  Or if you know what both of them are, you go, ooh, I wonder what that's like when he
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.560]  bred those together.
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.440]  So when we see two strain names in parentheses with an X in the middle, that indicates that
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.760]  those were the crossed plants that created the named strain that's listed above.
[08:38.760 --> 08:40.280]  So again, you'll see Arise.
[08:40.280 --> 08:45.200]  And then under that, you've got parentheses, Golden Goat X Daybreaker, and then a parentheses
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.360]  to close that.
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.000]  And that indicates that Arise is a cross of Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.040]  Now here's another detail that is often overlooked by many seed makers.
[08:56.040 --> 09:02.400]  It is proper practice to list Ladies first inside of that parentheses.
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.120]  So it would be proper to list parentheses, Mother X Father parentheses.
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.120]  You've got Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[09:10.120 --> 09:14.280]  Now we know that Golden Goat is the female and Daybreaker was the male in that cross.
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.080]  There is no doubt about that.
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.120]  And fortunately, that is not standard practice across the board with all breeders.
[09:21.120 --> 09:26.680]  It is proper practice in horticulture, but not all breeders have adopted this practice.
[09:26.680 --> 09:31.680]  Sometimes you have to ask the breeder, what was the male used in your project?
[09:31.680 --> 09:33.720]  Now we can take this even further.
[09:33.720 --> 09:37.960]  Sometimes you will see something in parentheses with the open and closed parentheses.
[09:37.960 --> 09:41.320]  You'll have Golden Goat X Daybreaker in a set of parentheses.
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.500]  Then you'll have another X, then two other things in a set of parentheses.
[09:45.500 --> 09:49.700]  Now that indicates that we have taken this plant in the set of parentheses.
[09:49.700 --> 09:50.700]  That is one plant.
[09:50.700 --> 09:54.620]  So you've probably got Golden Goat X Daybreaker in a set of parentheses that made a rise.
[09:54.620 --> 09:57.620]  Then you've got, I'm just going to pick something else over here.
[09:57.620 --> 10:02.720]  Let's say we've got parentheses, strawberry fields, X, blueberry cookies, and then parentheses
[10:02.720 --> 10:03.920]  to close that.
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.020]  So that would indicate that we have taken the progeny of the strawberry fields cross
[10:08.020 --> 10:09.380]  to blueberry cookies.
[10:09.380 --> 10:13.620]  And we've got a male of that because it is on the right side of the X.
[10:13.740 --> 10:16.580]  Then we've got the Golden Goat on the left side of the X.
[10:16.580 --> 10:20.940]  So basically that would indicate that we have now crossed the Golden Goat to the Raphael
[10:20.940 --> 10:25.060]  is what the strawberry fields to the blueberry cookies cross is.
[10:25.060 --> 10:28.820]  So that would be an indication that we have crossed a rise to the Raphael.
[10:28.820 --> 10:33.460]  And the reason that we do the multiple sets of parentheses is to kind of show grandparents
[10:33.460 --> 10:38.540]  because breeder nerds like myself and like many of you listening want to know, oh yeah,
[10:38.540 --> 10:41.380]  so it's a rise to Raphael.
[10:41.380 --> 10:42.380]  What's a rise?
[10:42.380 --> 10:45.380]  You want to know that a rise is Golden Goat to Daybreaker and you want to know what's
[10:45.380 --> 10:46.380]  Raphael.
[10:46.380 --> 10:48.600]  Raphael is strawberry fields to blueberry cookies.
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.740]  A lot of people like to know a little further back what the genetics are, what the family
[10:52.740 --> 10:53.900]  tree looks like.
[10:53.900 --> 10:55.480]  It's just fun if you're a nerd.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.480]  Some people are into that.
[10:56.480 --> 10:58.260]  Some people really do not care.
[10:58.260 --> 11:00.220]  Some breeders list that on the packages.
[11:00.220 --> 11:01.360]  Some do not.
[11:01.360 --> 11:04.460]  So mainly when you see the parentheses, that is one plant.
[11:04.460 --> 11:08.260]  When it has the parentheses and then a bunch of words and then an X in the middle and then
[11:08.260 --> 11:11.900]  a bunch of words and then more parentheses, that was one plant.
[11:11.900 --> 11:14.980]  Everything on the left side of your X is the female.
[11:14.980 --> 11:17.480]  Everything on the right side of the X is your male.
[11:17.480 --> 11:19.300]  And then you close that up and that's one plant.
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.720]  Then you put an X in the middle.
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.140]  That means you're crossing that to the other plant, which could be just one plant.
[11:24.140 --> 11:26.180]  We don't have to have something in parentheses over there.
[11:26.180 --> 11:32.800]  You may have taken Golden Goat to Daybreaker in parentheses, X blueberry cookies.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.800]  You can do that.
[11:33.800 --> 11:35.220]  So you don't have to have a cross on the other side.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.620]  It could be one thing.
[11:36.620 --> 11:38.920]  Hopefully this makes sense the way I'm explaining it.
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.720]  The main reason this is done, like I said before, is to let the purchaser, the consumer
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.880]  know the pedigree or the family tree of their seeds.
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.180]  Now sometimes there may be letters at the ends of those equations.
[11:52.180 --> 11:56.080]  We may have Fs or Ss or Rs and there also may be numbers in there.
[11:56.080 --> 11:58.060]  We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[11:58.060 --> 12:02.240]  Let's talk about more of the basic things we see on some seed packaging.
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.320]  Most seed packages will indicate a flowering time.
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.160]  If we are working with photo period seeds, that flowering time indicates the estimated
[12:12.160 --> 12:20.200]  time in which those seeds will take to finish flowering once the flowering stage has been
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.200]  initiated.
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.680]  Now, if you are growing indoors, flowering starts the day you switch your light cycle
[12:26.680 --> 12:28.240]  to 12-12.
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.200]  If you are growing outdoors, you have to pay attention to your calendar, your farmer's
[12:32.200 --> 12:35.560]  almanac, and you also have to keep an eye on the plants.
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.560]  But when we are working with photo period plants from photo period seeds, flowering
[12:40.560 --> 12:46.400]  time means the amount of time that the plants will take to finish flowering from the day
[12:46.400 --> 12:48.780]  we initiate the flowering phase.
[12:48.780 --> 12:51.040]  You can veg them as long as you want.
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.960]  These plants will veg as long as we keep them properly fed and they don't get root bound
[12:55.960 --> 12:58.880]  and there are no environmental factors that make them flower.
[12:58.880 --> 13:02.480]  We can veg them as long or as short as we want.
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.240]  In some cases, I veg my plants for 7-10 days, then I initiate flower by putting them under
[13:08.240 --> 13:11.080]  12-12 or 11-13 lighting.
[13:11.080 --> 13:14.240]  Sometimes I veg my plants for 100 days.
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.040]  It's all about my goal and what I'm trying to do with those plants.
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.800]  But the estimated flowering time that is printed on seed packaging is an indication of how
[13:22.800 --> 13:30.180]  long those seeds will take to finish flowering from the time you initiate the flowering cycle.
[13:30.180 --> 13:35.860]  And again, if you are indoors, day 1 of your flowering cycle begins the day you turn that
[13:35.860 --> 13:39.740]  timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[13:39.740 --> 13:44.580]  Now we also have to keep in mind that many breeders give you a range of when we can expect
[13:44.580 --> 13:46.660]  those plants to be finished.
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.060]  We have to keep in mind that we are working with seeds.
[13:49.060 --> 13:50.740]  We've got nature to work with.
[13:50.740 --> 13:54.820]  These plants have been selectively bred from phenotypes that have been tested, so we have
[13:54.820 --> 13:57.700]  a good idea of how long they are going to take to finish.
[13:57.700 --> 14:01.420]  Once they're bred, we grow a bunch of them out, we take good notes, we see how long they
[14:01.420 --> 14:03.780]  take to finish in several environments.
[14:03.780 --> 14:08.380]  But they are plants and there are different phenotypes in packs of seeds, so we have to
[14:08.380 --> 14:12.540]  give you an estimated timeframe in which those plants will be finished.
[14:12.540 --> 14:14.660]  I like to give about a 2-week window.
[14:14.660 --> 14:17.940]  I say these plants take 8-9 weeks to finish.
[14:17.940 --> 14:23.580]  That means somewhere between that 55-65 day mark, those plants will be done.
[14:23.660 --> 14:28.100]  There are a lot of factors that contribute to when a plant will be finished.
[14:28.100 --> 14:32.540]  I can take the same clone and grow it in my grow room and grow that same clone in your
[14:32.540 --> 14:38.300]  grow room and if we pay super close attention, we will notice that those plants reach peak
[14:38.300 --> 14:43.980]  ripeness at different times in our different grow rooms, even if we've got the same phenotype.
[14:43.980 --> 14:49.220]  We offer a timeframe in which we expect those plants to be finished.
[14:49.220 --> 14:53.340]  We're going to find different phenotypes and they're going to be grown in different environments,
[14:53.380 --> 14:58.340]  so we try to give the best estimate we can based on what our test results have shown.
[14:58.340 --> 15:03.220]  Most of my packages say that the plants will be finished within 8-9 weeks or 9-10 weeks
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.860]  or 10-11 weeks.
[15:04.860 --> 15:09.060]  That's the sort of range that I like to put on my packaging to give the consumer, to give
[15:09.060 --> 15:11.760]  the grower a good idea of what to expect.
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.800]  When you are growing from a pack of seeds and you don't know how long those plants take
[15:15.800 --> 15:22.380]  to flower, I always recommend you go the longest recommended time on the package.
[15:22.380 --> 15:25.980]  Some strains really like to beef up the last 7 days.
[15:25.980 --> 15:29.500]  Some strains really like to beef up the last 5 days.
[15:29.500 --> 15:35.240]  Some strains do really interesting things if you let them go past that 63-day mark.
[15:35.240 --> 15:37.740]  Let it go to 70 days and see what it does.
[15:37.740 --> 15:42.060]  Maybe it really beefs up, maybe it really gets an interesting aroma at the end, maybe
[15:42.060 --> 15:45.980]  it turns some really cool colors that you never would have known about if you didn't
[15:45.980 --> 15:47.660]  let it go that extra week.
[15:47.660 --> 15:49.740]  Yes, the trichomes are the boss.
[15:49.740 --> 15:53.740]  Always pay attention to the trichomes, but if you've got the opportunity to let one plant
[15:53.740 --> 15:56.700]  go longer just as an experiment, let it go.
[15:56.700 --> 15:57.700]  See what happens.
[15:57.700 --> 16:00.780]  You may be really satisfied with the results.
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.700]  So that is what we're talking about when we list the flowering time on the back of a package
[16:05.700 --> 16:07.100]  of seeds.
[16:07.100 --> 16:11.820]  Another thing that I more often see on websites, not as commonly on the package of seeds because
[16:11.820 --> 16:13.260]  a package of seeds is very little.
[16:13.260 --> 16:15.620]  We don't have a lot of space to write a lot of things.
[16:15.620 --> 16:18.820]  I occupy most of my space with cool artwork lately.
[16:18.900 --> 16:23.060]  Another thing I see on a lot of websites is what is known as morphology.
[16:23.060 --> 16:25.700]  And that means what are these plants going to look like?
[16:25.700 --> 16:30.180]  What type of growth characteristics can we expect from these plants?
[16:30.180 --> 16:34.580]  Morphology is an indicator of what types of phenotypes we can expect from these plants.
[16:34.580 --> 16:36.620]  So does it say short, squatty plants?
[16:36.620 --> 16:38.700]  Does it say tall, skinny plants?
[16:38.700 --> 16:40.620]  Does it say wide, bushy plants?
[16:40.620 --> 16:46.060]  That is what we mean by morphology, shape and characteristics, growth characteristics
[16:46.060 --> 16:47.980]  and traits we can expect from these plants.
[16:48.860 --> 16:51.180]  That in great detail on my website.
[16:51.180 --> 16:56.420]  Again, I don't list that on a lot of my packaging, but my packaging is ever evolving and ever
[16:56.420 --> 16:58.180]  changing just like my brand.
[16:58.180 --> 17:01.660]  So who knows, I may add morphology in the future.
[17:01.660 --> 17:07.300]  Let's talk about something I do list on many of my packages and that is aroma and flavor.
[17:07.300 --> 17:08.620]  That is quite obvious.
[17:08.620 --> 17:10.580]  What do I mean by aroma and flavor?
[17:10.580 --> 17:15.020]  That is what these buds, what these flowers are going to smell like and hopefully what
[17:15.020 --> 17:19.060]  they taste like once you harvest, dry and properly cure them.
[17:19.060 --> 17:24.380]  And another thing that many breeders include on their packaging is expected yield.
[17:24.380 --> 17:29.140]  Now I think expected yield and flavor and aroma are things that many breeders kind of
[17:29.140 --> 17:35.140]  get creative with when it comes to typing details on their packaging and their website
[17:35.140 --> 17:36.620]  descriptions.
[17:36.620 --> 17:43.660]  I do my best to be completely honest with my consumers when I am labeling my packages.
[17:43.660 --> 17:48.540]  My flavor descriptions are compilations of what I have smelled, what I have experienced,
[17:48.540 --> 17:52.260]  what I have tasted through multiple phenotypes of these plants.
[17:52.260 --> 17:55.060]  I also use information from my test growers.
[17:55.060 --> 17:59.500]  I've got a lot of friends out there that test grow my strains before they make it to the
[17:59.500 --> 18:00.500]  market.
[18:00.500 --> 18:01.500]  Big shout out to all my testers.
[18:01.500 --> 18:02.780]  Thank you for the great reports lately.
[18:02.780 --> 18:04.460]  You guys are doing great jobs.
[18:04.460 --> 18:10.580]  I also have many great friends around me who, some of them are cannabis snobs and some of
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.140]  them are honestly cannabis noobs.
[18:13.140 --> 18:17.420]  And I keep all those friends around and when we have a new thing to smoke, I get all of
[18:17.420 --> 18:20.360]  their information and I treat the cannabis noobs.
[18:20.360 --> 18:25.740]  Their information is just as important to me as the cannabis snobs because their palate,
[18:25.740 --> 18:27.460]  they say, oh, that tastes like this.
[18:27.460 --> 18:32.740]  And if a noob says that tastes just like tangerines and vanilla cream and a snob says that tastes
[18:32.740 --> 18:35.500]  like tangerines and vanilla cream, it must be accurate.
[18:35.500 --> 18:38.020]  So both of their opinions matter to me equally.
[18:38.020 --> 18:43.740]  I have a lot of people smoke and sample my products before I put those words on the packaging.
[18:43.740 --> 18:46.620]  I also do the same with the flowering times.
[18:46.620 --> 18:50.900]  I've got test growers out there that are growing stuff right now and I ask all of my testers
[18:50.900 --> 18:52.700]  to keep detailed notes for me.
[18:52.700 --> 18:55.980]  I know exactly what day they chopped down these plants.
[18:55.980 --> 19:00.340]  So I know if they're going 55, 62, 72 days.
[19:00.340 --> 19:03.860]  I've got a friend out there right now running a new strain of mine that is being tested
[19:03.860 --> 19:08.500]  who has been going for 12 weeks and he's sending me amazing reports every week.
[19:08.500 --> 19:10.140]  So I'm getting detailed reports.
[19:10.140 --> 19:13.180]  That's where my information comes from that I put on the packages.
[19:13.180 --> 19:18.380]  I do my best to be completely honest with the consumers because you know who I am.
[19:18.380 --> 19:21.980]  If I sell you some shit and it doesn't do what you expect, you know how to find me.
[19:21.980 --> 19:23.020]  You know who to email.
[19:23.020 --> 19:24.020]  It's just me.
[19:24.020 --> 19:25.020]  I am honest.
[19:25.020 --> 19:26.020]  I do my best.
[19:26.020 --> 19:30.260]  I can't say that for every seed company and breeder out there, but I wish I could.
[19:30.260 --> 19:32.680]  So expected yield or harvest weight.
[19:32.680 --> 19:33.680]  That should be obvious.
[19:34.500 --> 19:35.760]  It depends how much product you're going to get.
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.420]  But like I said, not all breeders are completely honest.
[19:39.420 --> 19:45.140]  And I try to use like general terms like big yields, small yields, medium yields.
[19:45.140 --> 19:50.080]  Sometimes I will say this may not be the fattest yielder in my arsenal, but the turps make
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.220]  up for it because sometimes that's how it is with cannabis.
[19:53.220 --> 19:54.220]  And I am honest.
[19:54.220 --> 19:58.260]  I want you to know that you were getting connoisseur grade, super stinky cannabis, but you may
[19:58.260 --> 20:00.100]  not get a whole bunch of it.
[20:00.100 --> 20:01.660]  That may be what some growers want.
[20:01.660 --> 20:03.920]  That may not be what you need for your area.
[20:03.920 --> 20:06.840]  I am honest, as honest as I could be on my packaging.
[20:06.840 --> 20:07.840]  The flavors and aromas.
[20:07.840 --> 20:12.240]  Again, like I said, we try to do our best when describing flavors and aromas.
[20:12.240 --> 20:14.360]  Some people get really creative.
[20:14.360 --> 20:19.280]  So those are most of the basic things we will see on a seed package.
[20:19.280 --> 20:24.160]  Now let's talk more about some of those random letters and numbers that we see in the strain
[20:24.160 --> 20:27.040]  descriptions and in the genetic listings.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.480]  So let's go back to talking about arise.
[20:29.500 --> 20:34.460]  Let's talk about that set of parentheses we had earlier with Golden Goat X Daybreaker
[20:34.460 --> 20:36.540]  within that set of parentheses.
[20:36.540 --> 20:41.640]  So I took a female Golden Goat plant and I pollinated it with a Daybreaker.
[20:41.640 --> 20:43.460]  That created arise.
[20:43.460 --> 20:47.780]  That was the first time that those two plants met and the first time they hooked up, the
[20:47.780 --> 20:49.420]  first time they met babies.
[20:49.420 --> 20:56.100]  So that is the first generation of arise, the first filial generation of arise.
[20:56.100 --> 21:00.100]  So now that is technically an arise F1.
[21:00.100 --> 21:05.620]  Now some people may argue that that is a polyhybrid and they may be correct, but for this story,
[21:05.620 --> 21:09.800]  we're going to focus on the F1 hybrid being the accurate description.
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.800]  The polyhybrid we'll talk about more way in the future because that is a way deeper topic,
[21:14.800 --> 21:18.380]  but let's focus on the F1 at this point.
[21:18.380 --> 21:20.540]  So Golden Goat and Daybreaker, they hook up.
[21:20.540 --> 21:21.540]  I'm a matchmaker.
[21:21.540 --> 21:22.820]  I introduced these two.
[21:22.820 --> 21:23.820]  They do their thing.
[21:23.820 --> 21:25.020]  They make some babies.
[21:25.020 --> 21:27.800]  Those babies, I named them arise.
[21:27.800 --> 21:30.620]  That is the first filial generation of arise.
[21:30.620 --> 21:33.120]  So they are arise F1.
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.680]  Now most of the time you are not going to see F1 listed on the packaging unless there
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.600]  is an F2 or a further generation made and that breeder is known or has been known to
[21:43.600 --> 21:46.820]  use that filial generation for other work.
[21:46.820 --> 21:51.720]  So most of the time, if you don't see an F listed on the cross, it is an F1.
[21:51.720 --> 21:54.640]  So we have got arise F1.
[21:54.640 --> 22:01.600]  If I were to take an arise male from that F1 batch and an arise female from that F1
[22:01.600 --> 22:09.060]  batch and I breed them together, their offspring will make the F2 generation.
[22:09.060 --> 22:14.740]  And the reason I would do that is to find the traits in the F1 that are most desirable
[22:14.740 --> 22:20.780]  and stabilize those traits, breed them together and make that F2 have the traits I want even
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.980]  stronger.
[22:21.980 --> 22:26.180]  And then at that point, we kind of eliminate other traits that we aren't looking for.
[22:26.180 --> 22:31.620]  Then to stabilize those desirable traits, I would find a male from that F2 batch and
[22:31.620 --> 22:36.060]  I would find a female from the F2 batch and I would breed them together.
[22:36.060 --> 22:43.020]  And that subsequent offspring, the progeny would be known as the F3 filial generation.
[22:43.020 --> 22:44.920]  And it just continues that way.
[22:44.920 --> 22:49.500]  Most of the time, a breeder will take that to F3 or F4 and they will have locked in the
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.660]  exact traits they are looking for.
[22:51.660 --> 22:56.940]  And most of those seeds will actually grow like clones of each other.
[22:56.940 --> 23:02.940]  You will have very stable genetics by the time you are to the F5 or F6 generation.
[23:02.940 --> 23:06.700]  Now a moment ago, I talked about polyhybrids.
[23:06.700 --> 23:11.700]  Polyhybrids are quite often overlooked in the world of cannabis breeding.
[23:11.700 --> 23:16.500]  Many people, including myself, are breeding with polyhybrids that are actually being called
[23:16.500 --> 23:17.940]  F1s.
[23:17.940 --> 23:21.740]  Let's talk about polyhybrids versus F1s.
[23:21.740 --> 23:26.420]  A polyhybrid is basically what most people are calling an F1.
[23:26.420 --> 23:32.540]  A polyhybrid is when you take a strain like Daybreaker and a strain like Golden Goat and
[23:32.540 --> 23:34.540]  you breed them together.
[23:34.540 --> 23:36.580]  Those create a new cross.
[23:36.580 --> 23:42.700]  It could be considered an F1, but it is actually a polyhybrid because the parents were not
[23:42.700 --> 23:46.980]  worked for stability for singled desirable traits.
[23:47.020 --> 23:52.740]  Now that is kind of a vague blanket statement to cover the term polyhybrid, but when I talk
[23:52.740 --> 23:56.460]  about proper F1s, it will make more sense.
[23:56.460 --> 24:03.460]  By breeding with an F1 version of Daybreaker and an F1 version of Golden Goat, I did not
[24:03.460 --> 24:11.420]  have the opportunity to lock in the traits of my parent plants to ensure that I got offspring
[24:11.420 --> 24:15.220]  that showed those plants and not their grandparents.
[24:15.260 --> 24:20.700]  So the proper way to do it would to have taken the Golden Goat and worked the Golden Goat
[24:20.700 --> 24:27.640]  to F3, F4, or maybe F5 until I locked in the traits that I was searching for on the Golden
[24:27.640 --> 24:30.180]  Goat side of the breeding project.
[24:30.180 --> 24:32.580]  What was I looking for on the Golden Goat side?
[24:32.580 --> 24:38.180]  I wanted that sweet tropical flavor and that potency, but then from the Daybreaker side,
[24:38.180 --> 24:40.780]  I also wanted that cushy stankiness.
[24:40.780 --> 24:46.100]  My goal was to see what happened when I put two plants that were completely opposite together
[24:46.100 --> 24:48.140]  and I hit the goal with that.
[24:48.140 --> 24:53.140]  But proper breeding would have been to breed the Golden Goat until I locked in the traits
[24:53.140 --> 25:01.220]  that I wanted and then also breed the Daybreaker to the F3, F4, possibly the F5 or F6 generation
[25:01.220 --> 25:06.940]  to really lock in the traits I'm looking for there, then breed those together and make
[25:06.940 --> 25:08.380]  the Arise.
[25:08.380 --> 25:11.500]  In theory, that would have made a more stable cross.
[25:11.500 --> 25:15.340]  We would have less variation in phenotypical expression.
[25:15.340 --> 25:20.740]  The reality is I only had one Golden Goat because Golden Goat is a clone only, so I
[25:20.740 --> 25:25.740]  did not have the opportunity to work that unless I did a back cross, which I have done.
[25:25.740 --> 25:28.100]  We will talk about back crossing in a moment.
[25:28.100 --> 25:30.400]  And honestly, that was not my goal with this cross.
[25:30.400 --> 25:36.380]  My goal was to put that super tropical Golden Goat to the super dank and stanky OG cush
[25:36.380 --> 25:39.420]  looking Daybreaker and kind of create that polyhybrid.
[25:39.420 --> 25:40.580]  I knew that's what I was doing.
[25:40.580 --> 25:46.940]  That was my intention here, but that is often confused as an F1 is the point here.
[25:46.940 --> 25:52.140]  Basically crossing two F1s that were not stabilized makes a polyhybrid.
[25:52.140 --> 25:55.340]  I'm probably going to get some emails about that because that was kind of fumbled through
[25:55.340 --> 25:56.340]  that one.
[25:56.340 --> 25:57.540]  Honestly, I don't have a lot of notes here.
[25:57.540 --> 25:59.980]  I didn't plan on talking about polyhybrids.
[25:59.980 --> 26:01.260]  Let's keep moving forward.
[26:01.260 --> 26:02.300]  I do have a few more things.
[26:02.300 --> 26:04.780]  I did mention BX just a moment ago.
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.200]  What is a BX?
[26:06.220 --> 26:10.840]  I did mention that I've made a Golden Goat BX, so let's focus on that one.
[26:10.840 --> 26:13.760]  Many people want Golden Goat seeds.
[26:13.760 --> 26:16.700]  Golden Goat is only available in a female plant.
[26:16.700 --> 26:19.520]  There was never a male Golden Goat released.
[26:19.520 --> 26:21.840]  Golden Goat is what's known as a clone only.
[26:21.840 --> 26:23.200]  There's only a female.
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.840]  The breeder, Mr. Dank from Topeka, Kansas, never put out a male.
[26:27.840 --> 26:29.480]  People want Golden Goat seeds.
[26:29.480 --> 26:31.480]  I made feminized seeds of Golden Goat.
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.360]  It is available in fems.
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.720]  A lot of consumers do not want feminized seeds, but they still want a shot at the Golden Goat.
[26:38.720 --> 26:43.360]  So I have created a Golden Goat BX, and I'll tell you how I did that.
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.800]  My Golden Goat BX starts, of course, with a Golden Goat female.
[26:47.800 --> 26:52.200]  I pollinated that Golden Goat female with a Daybreaker male.
[26:52.200 --> 26:55.560]  Yes, this is how Arise was made.
[26:55.560 --> 27:01.640]  There is a really good reason for using the Daybreaker male to create a Golden Goat BX.
[27:01.640 --> 27:07.760]  The traits of Golden Goat and Daybreaker are very obviously visibly different.
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.720]  Golden Goat has long, thin, skinny, pointy leaves.
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.040]  Daybreaker makes big, fat, white leaves that you could fucking camp under.
[27:16.040 --> 27:17.720]  So I bred them together.
[27:17.720 --> 27:23.360]  Then I grew out a bunch of the seeds and took very close notes on how these plants grew.
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.600]  Then I found a male that looked exactly like my female Golden Goat.
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.800]  This male had the exact same plant structure.
[27:33.800 --> 27:38.000]  This male took the same amount of time to go into flower.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.120]  This male smelled exactly the same on the stem rub.
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.520]  This male smelled exactly like Golden Goat late in flower.
[27:46.520 --> 27:53.040]  The best part about this male was that the leaves look just like the female Golden Goat,
[27:53.040 --> 27:59.580]  to the extent that it had the exact same number of serrations on the leaves and the leaf tips
[27:59.580 --> 28:03.940]  did the same exact little curling thing that the Golden Goat female did when I overfed
[28:03.940 --> 28:04.940]  it.
[28:04.940 --> 28:09.460]  This was a beautiful replica of my Golden Goat female.
[28:09.460 --> 28:15.220]  I could tell that it did not have much of the Daybreaker traits to it because it did
[28:15.220 --> 28:18.580]  not show any Daybreaker traits at all.
[28:18.580 --> 28:19.980]  It didn't smell like it.
[28:19.980 --> 28:20.980]  It didn't act like it.
[28:20.980 --> 28:21.980]  It didn't grow like it.
[28:21.980 --> 28:23.940]  It certainly did not look like it.
[28:23.940 --> 28:28.700]  So I was confident that I had a very Golden Goat dominant male.
[28:28.700 --> 28:34.580]  I took that Golden Goat dominant male and put that pollen on the original female Golden
[28:34.580 --> 28:35.580]  Goat.
[28:35.580 --> 28:40.860]  Now I have back-crossed because I have out-crossed that Golden Goat to the Daybreaker and it
[28:40.860 --> 28:41.860]  made seeds.
[28:41.860 --> 28:47.580]  Then I found a male in there that looks just like the female and I put that pollen back
[28:47.580 --> 28:48.820]  on the female.
[28:48.820 --> 28:54.580]  The seeds that came out of there are a Golden Goat back-cross one, which would be labeled
[28:54.580 --> 28:56.820]  as a BX1.
[28:56.940 --> 29:02.220]  Now if I were to grow those and find another male that was even a more close representation
[29:02.220 --> 29:08.100]  of that original female Golden Goat and back-cross that onto the original female again, that
[29:08.100 --> 29:10.580]  would be a BX2.
[29:10.580 --> 29:17.060]  Fortunately for me, I did enough work finding my first male that I feel like that back-cross
[29:17.060 --> 29:23.900]  is a very close representation of the original Golden Goat and everybody who has grown it
[29:23.900 --> 29:26.660]  has been satisfied with the outcome.
[29:26.660 --> 29:30.660]  So that is a back-cross indicated as a BX.
[29:30.660 --> 29:35.620]  The main reason for that is to make something available in seed form that was not available
[29:35.620 --> 29:41.500]  in seed without making it in a feminized form because many people are opposed to feminized
[29:41.500 --> 29:42.660]  seeds.
[29:42.660 --> 29:47.520]  Now I'm actually going to work my way into some feminized seed labels.
[29:47.520 --> 29:50.680]  Many people have a strong bias against feminized seeds.
[29:50.680 --> 29:51.740]  I make fem seeds.
[29:51.740 --> 29:54.620]  I understand how feminized seeds are made and how they work.
[29:54.620 --> 29:59.900]  I think they are a great option for a grower who is limited on numbers or a grower who
[29:59.900 --> 30:02.500]  needs every seed they plant to be a female.
[30:02.500 --> 30:05.020]  I understand the need for feminized seeds.
[30:05.020 --> 30:06.620]  Let's talk about how they are labeled.
[30:06.620 --> 30:08.660]  We're not going to talk too much about how they're made today.
[30:08.660 --> 30:11.160]  We're going to talk about how we label them.
[30:11.160 --> 30:16.580]  Most often when it comes to feminized seeds, you will see either an R or an S for a fem
[30:16.580 --> 30:17.860]  seed.
[30:17.860 --> 30:22.180]  Let's talk about S. You may see something like a Golden Goat S1.
[30:22.180 --> 30:24.600]  I make Golden Goat S1s.
[30:24.600 --> 30:27.360]  That S indicates the word self.
[30:27.360 --> 30:33.060]  What I have done, I have taken a female Golden Goat plant and I have made two clones.
[30:33.060 --> 30:37.700]  One of them I have decided is going to be treated with a solution that will become my
[30:37.700 --> 30:39.260]  pollen donor.
[30:39.260 --> 30:41.500]  The other one is going to be a female.
[30:41.500 --> 30:42.720]  She gets left alone.
[30:42.720 --> 30:45.300]  She becomes my pollen receiver.
[30:45.300 --> 30:50.360]  I treat the selected plant with a solution that causes that plant to create pollen that
[30:50.360 --> 30:56.120]  only contains female chromosomes because there are no male chromosomes in that plant.
[30:56.120 --> 30:57.120]  It's a girl.
[30:57.120 --> 30:58.560]  I treat it with a solution.
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.560]  It creates pollen.
[30:59.560 --> 31:01.480]  That pollen is all female.
[31:01.480 --> 31:04.760]  I put that female pollen on to the Golden Goat.
[31:04.760 --> 31:10.520]  Now we have taken Golden Goat female pollen and put it on a Golden Goat female plant.
[31:10.520 --> 31:14.920]  The outcome is all female Golden Goat seeds.
[31:14.920 --> 31:19.740]  Now since there have not been any other genetics introduced into that project, it is known
[31:19.820 --> 31:22.940]  as a self, an S1.
[31:22.940 --> 31:27.860]  So Golden Goat S1 represents a Golden Goat selfed seed.
[31:27.860 --> 31:33.940]  A female Golden Goat, it was reversed and that pollen was applied to a Golden Goat plant.
[31:33.940 --> 31:37.780]  Now we are going to move forward and talk about an R1.
[31:37.780 --> 31:43.060]  If I were to take that Golden Goat pollen which I spoke of before and I apply that Golden
[31:43.060 --> 31:50.620]  Goat pollen to any other female plant, the resulting seeds are R1.
[31:50.620 --> 31:52.860]  That is called a reversal.
[31:52.860 --> 31:55.240]  Lemon Jeffrey is an R1.
[31:55.240 --> 32:01.560]  Lemon Jeffrey is a female Lemon Skunk plant which was pollinated by a reversed Golden
[32:01.560 --> 32:02.560]  Goat plant.
[32:02.560 --> 32:03.560]  Reversed.
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.960]  R. Reversed 1.
[32:04.960 --> 32:06.460]  It's a reversal 1.
[32:06.460 --> 32:13.300]  It is very similar to the F1 that I spoke of much earlier in the show, but I used feminized
[32:13.300 --> 32:14.300]  pollen.
[32:14.300 --> 32:15.700]  So that is an R1.
[32:15.700 --> 32:19.860]  So S indicates self and R indicates reverse.
[32:19.860 --> 32:21.780]  Self means I did it myself.
[32:21.780 --> 32:27.740]  R means reversed pollen that was put onto different plants to create different hybrids.
[32:27.740 --> 32:34.020]  Now you may see S2 and R2 and things of that nature, but those are very less common than
[32:34.140 --> 32:38.500]  an F2, an F3, or a BX2 or something like that.
[32:38.500 --> 32:42.700]  The most common indicator you're going to see on a feminized seed is usually going to
[32:42.700 --> 32:44.620]  be that S1.
[32:44.620 --> 32:50.780]  If you see Blueberry Cookies S1 or Golden Goat S1, that means that that plant was simply
[32:50.780 --> 32:53.140]  used, reversed, pollinated itself.
[32:53.140 --> 32:54.900]  There are no other genetics in there.
[32:54.900 --> 32:57.460]  I find those to be highly desirable.
[32:57.460 --> 33:01.260]  If I've got a strain that I need to preserve, let's just pick a strain.
[33:01.260 --> 33:03.500]  We'll say Lemon G.
[33:03.500 --> 33:05.420]  I was growing Lemon G for a long time.
[33:05.420 --> 33:07.740]  It was very desirable, very sought after.
[33:07.740 --> 33:10.980]  I kind of got bored with it, but I didn't want to give it up forever.
[33:10.980 --> 33:11.980]  So what did I do?
[33:11.980 --> 33:12.980]  I reversed it.
[33:12.980 --> 33:14.100]  I made a few seeds.
[33:14.100 --> 33:19.100]  Now I've got Lemon G, feminized seeds stashed away in a stash.
[33:19.100 --> 33:25.100]  I've got just enough of them to where I think when I grow them, I will find very close representations
[33:25.100 --> 33:30.980]  of the original Lemon G because there are no other genetics added to that gene pool
[33:31.300 --> 33:33.660]  and every seed I've got is a female.
[33:33.660 --> 33:38.520]  So that is a very great way to preserve a seed line if there's a reason why you need
[33:38.520 --> 33:39.740]  to get rid of it.
[33:39.740 --> 33:41.740]  I chose to get rid of that Lemon G.
[33:41.740 --> 33:43.620]  Of course, I gave clones of it to Tenasi.
[33:43.620 --> 33:46.900]  I gave clones of it to everybody around me so that it could live, so that it could survive,
[33:46.900 --> 33:49.820]  so that it could get spread, but I no longer have it.
[33:49.820 --> 33:53.160]  When I choose to have it again, I've got the Lemon G S1.
[33:53.160 --> 33:54.840]  Now here is proper etiquette.
[33:54.840 --> 34:01.200]  When I grow those Lemon G S1s, if I share the clone, I will label it Lemon G S1.
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.960]  Also, when I put the buds in a bag, they will be labeled Lemon G S1.
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.180]  That way, if there's a variance, if there's a difference, if there's a medical cannabis
[34:11.180 --> 34:15.940]  patient that smokes Lemon G and it works beautifully for them, I don't want to dupe them into thinking
[34:15.940 --> 34:19.500]  they got Lemon G when they just got my Lemon G S1.
[34:19.500 --> 34:23.720]  That is proper etiquette as a grower, as a bro, as a good person.
[34:23.720 --> 34:26.840]  I feel like we have covered R1 and S1.
[34:26.840 --> 34:28.560]  We've covered most of the feminized talk.
[34:28.560 --> 34:31.960]  We've covered the male and female talk.
[34:31.960 --> 34:35.960]  Let's work our way toward talking about A and B lines.
[34:35.960 --> 34:37.800]  There's a breeder that we all know quite well.
[34:37.800 --> 34:40.080]  He's dominating the damn seed game right now.
[34:40.080 --> 34:41.760]  I'm not going to say his name or his brand name.
[34:41.760 --> 34:42.760]  He knows who he is.
[34:42.760 --> 34:44.000]  Big shout out, bro.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.320]  He likes to put out A and B lines.
[34:47.320 --> 34:49.040]  Some people are confused by this.
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.600]  I find it to be a great idea and I understand what is happening.
[34:52.600 --> 34:58.100]  Let me talk a little bit about A and B lines when it comes to breeding and marketing and
[34:58.100 --> 35:00.080]  releasing these packages.
[35:00.080 --> 35:04.800]  I was talking about polyhybrids and F1s and stabilized strains earlier.
[35:04.800 --> 35:07.140]  I use the word work a lot.
[35:07.140 --> 35:10.960]  To work a strain means that you have either bred it to something or you've taken it a
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.280]  further generation, you've outcrossed it, you have done some work with it.
[35:15.280 --> 35:22.320]  Let's talk about really working a strain as a breeder to get sought after desirable traits.
[35:22.320 --> 35:25.720]  As a breeder, it is important to start with a goal.
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.560]  Sometimes that goal is a couple of traits in a specific plant that we are really trying
[35:31.560 --> 35:33.120]  to narrow down.
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.960]  We may have two plants that we see great potential in and we want to breed them together, but
[35:38.960 --> 35:45.380]  we may not be able to get there by making an F1 or what is more properly labeled a polyhybrid.
[35:45.380 --> 35:50.520]  The first time we breed that together, our phenotypes are going to vary widely.
[35:50.520 --> 35:57.280]  25% will probably look like the mom, 25% will probably look like the dad, and the other
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.960]  50% are going to be mix mashes in between.
[36:00.960 --> 36:06.000]  Depending on what your goal was, you may have hit your goal on this first round of breeding.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.480]  But if we want more reliable seeds, there is a better way to go about this, but it takes
[36:11.480 --> 36:13.160]  much more work.
[36:13.160 --> 36:14.640]  Let's talk about it.
[36:14.640 --> 36:19.040]  Let's say that my new goal is to cross these two plants I just got and I want to get the
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.000]  potency of this plant and the flavor of this plant into one solid hybrid and I want to
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.440]  put that to market so that you guys can purchase it and you can grow it and you can be completely
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.240]  satisfied with your results.
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.000]  The easy and quick way to doing this is to get a male of one of those strains and another
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.600]  female of the opposite strain and pollinate.
[36:39.600 --> 36:41.600]  And now you have made seeds.
[36:41.600 --> 36:47.800]  Now 25% of that progeny is going to look like the mother, 25% of the progeny will look like
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.720]  the father, the other 50% are going to be variations of the mom and dad and different
[36:53.720 --> 36:57.560]  combinations of possibly the grandparents and the mom and dad.
[36:57.560 --> 37:01.200]  Now if I am okay with that, my project can be done.
[37:01.200 --> 37:02.880]  Or I can take it further.
[37:02.880 --> 37:07.360]  If I really want to lock in the potency from that one strain and the flavor of the other
[37:07.360 --> 37:12.280]  strain and have reliable offspring, I need to work this further.
[37:12.280 --> 37:17.520]  Now I could continue just to work the F generations down the line and hope that I get that
[37:17.520 --> 37:20.640]  potency and that flavor that I'm really looking for.
[37:20.640 --> 37:26.160]  And that is just working the F1 and then finding an F1 male and an F1 female that look like
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.200]  they're going to do what I need done and breed them together and continue down that path
[37:30.200 --> 37:32.860]  working for both of those traits.
[37:32.860 --> 37:39.320]  Another way to do this would be to work two separate lines of the same project and focus
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.360]  on the potency in one line and the flavor on the other line.
[37:43.360 --> 37:48.840]  So we'll say that line A is the potency and line B is the flavor, but it's the same strain.
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.640]  We have still crossed the two parents, except I have selected different offspring and I'm
[37:53.640 --> 37:59.360]  focusing on different traits in two completely different breeding projects.
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.040]  Now depending on how much space, how much time, how many plants I can dedicate to this,
[38:04.040 --> 38:10.120]  I may be able to do both of these projects simultaneously and fast track this whole project.
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.280]  Unfortunately, I am limited by plant counts and space and time, so I may have to run the
[38:15.280 --> 38:17.080]  A line as one project.
[38:17.080 --> 38:20.000]  I can breed that to my desired uniformity.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.800]  Then I can work on the B line, breed that to my desired uniformity.
[38:23.800 --> 38:25.720]  Then we'll talk about the next step after that.
[38:25.720 --> 38:30.760]  But what I would be doing is I would take the line A, I'm looking for potency over here.
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.160]  I forgot what I aimed the line A as, but we're going to say A is potency.
[38:34.160 --> 38:35.720]  I would breed F1.
[38:35.720 --> 38:39.160]  I would find the most potent phenotype out of there I could find.
[38:39.200 --> 38:41.520]  Then I would breed that to an F2.
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.000]  Then I would find the most potent phenotype I could find.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.640]  I wouldn't worry about the aroma.
[38:46.640 --> 38:48.760]  I wouldn't worry too much about the structure.
[38:48.760 --> 38:51.520]  I wouldn't be paying too many attention to the other details.
[38:51.520 --> 38:55.640]  I would only have maybe one or two things I'm really focused on, the aroma and probably
[38:55.640 --> 38:58.440]  shape and structure are what I'm after on this side.
[38:58.440 --> 39:03.520]  And then I'm going to breed that all the way to like F3, F4, maybe five or six, depending
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.120]  on how long it takes me to lock in those traits that I'm looking for.
[39:07.120 --> 39:13.800]  I want 75 to 80% of my seeds that I sprout to come out looking just like what I'm after.
[39:13.800 --> 39:15.160]  I need that uniformity.
[39:15.160 --> 39:18.120]  Once I get there, I'll put that project on hold.
[39:18.120 --> 39:22.040]  I'll get a bunch of those F5 or F6 seeds and I stash them.
[39:22.040 --> 39:23.040]  They're on hold.
[39:23.040 --> 39:24.040]  They're waiting.
[39:24.040 --> 39:25.040]  We'll talk about those in a minute.
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.000]  I'll go over here and now we're going to work line B. On line B, I am only working for that
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.940]  flavor I was searching for.
[39:31.940 --> 39:35.800]  If I'm looking for, today we're just going to say strawberry bubblegum.
[39:35.800 --> 39:40.760]  If that's the flavor I'm seeking, any phenotype that doesn't have that strawberry bubblegum
[39:40.760 --> 39:42.400]  dominance, it's getting cold.
[39:42.400 --> 39:43.720]  We aren't working with it.
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.320]  So I'm going to find the most strawberry bubblegum dominant phenotype I can find.
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.640]  I'm going to breed that to an F2.
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.120]  Then in that F2 batch, find the most strawberry bubblegum dominant phenotype I can find.
[39:56.120 --> 40:02.960]  Breed that to F3 and keep going until I get absolute uniformity around F5, F6.
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.160]  Where far it takes me to get the uniformity I'm looking for.
[40:06.160 --> 40:09.960]  Then I've got what I've considered my A line and my B line.
[40:09.960 --> 40:15.200]  I've got New Cross, which is super potent line A and New Cross, which is super flavorful
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.920]  line B. They're the same cross, but they've been bred, selectively bred for different
[40:19.920 --> 40:21.080]  traits.
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.360]  Some breeders will release the F1s of those on both sides.
[40:24.360 --> 40:26.360]  Some breeders may release the F2s.
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.200]  Some breeders may release one line of that and not even let you know that there's a B
[40:30.200 --> 40:31.200]  line.
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.600]  When it comes to breeding, it is not uncommon to run an A and a B line and focus on one
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.480]  or two desirable traits on both of those lines.
[40:40.480 --> 40:42.960]  Then here's where the magic happens.
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.200]  We find a phenotype from line A that holds that potency we are looking for.
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.880]  Then we find a phenotype from line B that holds that flavor we are looking for.
[40:52.880 --> 41:00.960]  And we breed those F5 or those F6s together and it makes a brand new, real F1 hybrid that
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.960]  is no longer a polyhybrid.
[41:02.960 --> 41:06.800]  That is a true bred, solid F1 hybrid.
[41:06.800 --> 41:08.360]  So I feel like we have gone full circle.
[41:08.360 --> 41:11.400]  I kind of got lost earlier on a ramble about polyhybrids, but there we go.
[41:11.400 --> 41:12.400]  I brought it back.
[41:12.400 --> 41:14.820]  I feel like I wrapped that one up with a nice little bow for you.
[41:14.820 --> 41:19.080]  So that was the long rant about the difference in the A line and the B line and why sometimes
[41:19.080 --> 41:20.720]  we see A lines and B lines.
[41:20.720 --> 41:23.560]  It is just different breeding for different traits.
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.460]  And then in the end, we combine the A and the B to create that super hybrid, that brand
[41:28.460 --> 41:32.620]  new F1 that has the desirable traits that are locked in.
[41:32.620 --> 41:36.820]  Then if you want to be a real nerd, you can start F2ing that and you can lock in traits
[41:36.820 --> 41:38.000]  even further.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Breeding gets fun.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  Breeding gets addictive.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.640]  I've got one more type of breeding written down that I really want to talk about before
[41:43.640 --> 41:45.660]  I start wrapping up this episode.
[41:45.660 --> 41:51.580]  This one is kind of the total opposite of working with an A and a B line or some sort
[41:51.580 --> 41:52.640]  of selection.
[41:52.640 --> 41:55.660]  This is what is called open pollination.
[41:55.660 --> 41:58.980]  Open pollination is basically a big old plant orgy.
[41:58.980 --> 42:04.060]  That is when you put multiple males and multiple females in a room and just let the pollen
[42:04.060 --> 42:05.060]  fly.
[42:05.060 --> 42:09.980]  So you may get females that have been pollinated by this male and this male.
[42:09.980 --> 42:14.620]  So one female plant will contain several different crosses.
[42:14.620 --> 42:18.820]  This gives you an opportunity for a lot of different phenotypes.
[42:18.820 --> 42:22.880]  Open pollination can be done with all the same strain or open pollination can be done
[42:22.880 --> 42:24.780]  by mixing strains.
[42:24.900 --> 42:31.380]  The reason it would be done with all of the same strain is to find diversity in your progeny.
[42:31.380 --> 42:37.300]  Imagine if I put two males of arise and four females of arise, all different phenotypes
[42:37.300 --> 42:42.300]  in the room, and I just let those two males pollinate all four of those females.
[42:42.300 --> 42:46.580]  We're going to have a lot of different combinations of offspring, which will give me a lot of
[42:46.580 --> 42:51.820]  opportunity to find a lot of great winners to breed with in the future.
[42:51.860 --> 42:58.020]  So if I put two arise males and four arise females in a room and I did a pollination,
[42:58.020 --> 43:01.340]  that would be known as an arise open pollination.
[43:01.340 --> 43:06.380]  Now if they were all F1s I put in there, it would be an arise F2 open pollination, and
[43:06.380 --> 43:10.940]  it would be polite on the packaging or somewhere in the description to say, hey, I used two
[43:10.940 --> 43:15.260]  arise males and I pollinated four females, and these are some of the seeds that came
[43:15.260 --> 43:17.180]  from all of that batch.
[43:17.180 --> 43:19.900]  That's an open pollination, and that is very acceptable.
[43:19.980 --> 43:24.380]  And again, the reason that is great is because it will create a lot of really interesting
[43:24.380 --> 43:25.380]  phenotypes.
[43:25.380 --> 43:29.140]  It will really open up the gene pool and give you a lot of diversity.
[43:29.140 --> 43:34.100]  Now some people will do an open pollination by putting one or two different males in with
[43:34.100 --> 43:36.660]  multiple different females.
[43:36.660 --> 43:41.060]  This is not ideal to me because I'm really picky and I like to know what everything was
[43:41.060 --> 43:45.300]  pollinated with, but if you're just trying to create seeds to play with for the future
[43:45.300 --> 43:49.220]  and you're not too worried about genetics, about heritage, about pedigree, that will
[43:49.540 --> 43:50.540]  work.
[43:50.540 --> 43:52.540]  You will also find a lot of great phenotypes.
[43:52.540 --> 43:56.540]  Again, the only thing I don't like about that is we don't know what they are, but to some
[43:56.540 --> 43:58.940]  people that is not important at all.
[43:58.940 --> 44:00.620]  They just want to grow good weed.
[44:00.620 --> 44:04.140]  There are some people in some places that don't have access to more seeds and they're
[44:04.140 --> 44:06.340]  just growing the seeds that they produce.
[44:06.340 --> 44:08.800]  They may be tired of all the same old shit they've been growing.
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.580]  This may be a great way to diversify your gene pool.
[44:12.580 --> 44:14.940]  So that is my talk on open pollination.
[44:14.940 --> 44:16.780]  I feel like I covered the basics.
[44:16.780 --> 44:18.940]  We talked about F1s and F2s.
[44:18.940 --> 44:20.860]  We talked about S1s, R1s.
[44:20.860 --> 44:22.640]  We've talked about back crossing.
[44:22.640 --> 44:23.860]  We've talked about open pollination.
[44:23.860 --> 44:27.500]  I need to listen back and see if I got my part about polyhybrids right.
[44:27.500 --> 44:31.140]  I also need to review the part about A and B lines and make sure I set that right.
[44:31.140 --> 44:34.980]  I do have very minimal notes here in front of me, so I need to go back and make sure
[44:34.980 --> 44:35.980]  I said things correctly.
[44:35.980 --> 44:39.900]  I want to thank our friend Jeff with a G for a great email.
[44:39.900 --> 44:43.540]  If anybody else out there has a grow question or perhaps you need to make a correction on
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.040]  this episode, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[44:48.040 --> 44:50.240]  You know that I would love to hear from you.
[44:50.240 --> 44:53.240]  I also look forward to seeing you at the Indo Expo.
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.120]  Join me at the Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado on January 25th and 26th.
[44:58.120 --> 45:04.160]  The 25th is Business to Business Professionals Day, but the 26th is open to the general public.
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.000]  I do recommend you buy your tickets for the Expo before you make your travel plans because
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.240]  the Indo Expo will sell out.
[45:12.240 --> 45:13.240]  Come by my booth.
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.240]  Come shake my hand.
[45:14.240 --> 45:15.240]  Come say hi.
[45:15.240 --> 45:16.240]  Come take a selfie.
[45:16.240 --> 45:19.120]  I look forward to meeting you at the Indo Expo.

[45:55.520 --> 45:58.040]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[45:58.040 --> 46:01.360]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend Big Toe Grows.
[46:01.360 --> 46:04.960]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[46:15.600 --> 46:20.720]  I heard about the things you said.
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.760]  I heard about the things you do.
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.440]  And hurting you is the last thing I want to do, baby.
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.000]  But I can't go on living a lie.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.160]  When God knows how much I've tried.
[46:36.160 --> 46:41.040]  To love and treat you every way that I should, baby.
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.560]  Now I see that I'm holding on to something not good.
[46:45.560 --> 46:47.400]  It's all lies.
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.520]  But temptation's got me wanting to stay.
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.760]  But baby, it's time to say goodbye.
[46:56.760 --> 46:58.960]  To this love we share.
[46:58.960 --> 47:03.000]  It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.880]  Oh, God.
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.760]  It's time to say goodbye.
[47:08.760 --> 47:10.920]  To this love we share.
[47:10.920 --> 47:13.400]  It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[47:18.400 --> 47:24.880]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.360]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[47:29.360 --> 47:32.840]  Oh.
[47:32.840 --> 47:35.840]  I work hard each day and night.
[47:35.840 --> 47:38.840]  Trying to make our love life right.
[47:39.240 --> 47:44.720]  But to you, all I do is never good, baby.
[47:44.720 --> 47:47.680]  We've been at this same place before.
[47:47.680 --> 47:50.680]  And God knows I can't take no more.
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.640]  Sorry days for me are gone out the door.
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.120]  Because I know that holding on to something not good
[48:00.120 --> 48:02.120]  is all lies.
[48:02.120 --> 48:06.120]  But temptation's got me wanting to stay.
[48:06.400 --> 48:11.400]  But baby, I gotta say goodbye.
[48:11.400 --> 48:13.880]  To this love we share.
[48:13.880 --> 48:17.880]  It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[48:17.880 --> 48:19.880]  Oh, God.
[48:19.880 --> 48:23.360]  It's time to say goodbye.
[48:23.360 --> 48:25.840]  To this love we share.
[48:25.840 --> 48:29.840]  It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[48:29.840 --> 48:30.340]  Oh.
[48:30.540 --> 48:31.040]  Oh.
[48:35.540 --> 48:39.020]  I never meant to hurt you, baby.
[48:39.020 --> 48:41.500]  I never meant to hurt you, baby.
[48:41.500 --> 48:45.980]  But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
[48:45.980 --> 48:47.460]  Ooh.
[48:47.460 --> 48:50.940]  Because I heard about the things you said.
[48:50.940 --> 48:53.900]  I heard about the things you do.
[48:53.900 --> 48:59.660]  And hurting you is the last thing I want to do, baby.
[48:59.980 --> 49:02.940]  But I can't go on living this lie.
