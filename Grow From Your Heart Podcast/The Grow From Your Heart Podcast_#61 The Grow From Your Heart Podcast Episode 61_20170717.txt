[00:10.750 --> 00:20.530]  Yo, what's up cannabis community?
[00:20.530 --> 00:25.250]  It's time for episode number 61 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:25.250 --> 00:27.290]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.290 --> 00:29.290]  Oh, it's right here.
[00:29.290 --> 00:35.850]  Okay.
[00:35.850 --> 00:36.850]  Sorry.
[00:36.850 --> 00:37.850]  My headphones went...
[00:37.850 --> 00:43.850]  I had no idea what was going on.
[00:43.850 --> 00:44.850]  You guys couldn't hear me though.
[00:44.850 --> 00:45.850]  It was just like full stop.
[00:45.850 --> 00:49.370]  This one was just playing right across my fucking headphone thing right there and it
[00:49.370 --> 00:54.530]  was like, man, dude, that was miserable in my headphone.
[00:54.530 --> 00:55.970]  Holy crap.
[00:55.970 --> 00:56.970]  Yeah.
[00:56.970 --> 00:57.970]  Are you still recording?
[00:57.970 --> 00:58.970]  Yeah, but I'm going to go back and...
[00:58.970 --> 00:59.970]  Don't.
[00:59.970 --> 01:00.970]  No, just leave this in the show.
[01:00.970 --> 01:01.970]  All right.
[01:01.970 --> 01:02.970]  Our host is from...
[01:02.970 --> 01:08.290]  All right, just to relay what just happened here is he literally turned off every switch
[01:08.290 --> 01:12.970]  and put his headset down like something he had to poop or something like...
[01:12.970 --> 01:15.290]  Something was happening.
[01:16.290 --> 01:21.610]  And all of a sudden our illustrious host just wigged the fuck out and started hitting buttons
[01:21.610 --> 01:24.850]  real fast and flipping it switches and making faces.
[01:24.850 --> 01:25.850]  I don't know what happened.
[01:25.850 --> 01:28.890]  I do know now, but at the time I was like, oh God, I had a head injury recently and I
[01:28.890 --> 01:30.450]  don't know if that's coming back on me.
[01:30.450 --> 01:33.010]  It looked intensely painful and scary.
[01:33.010 --> 01:34.490]  Like his face got all...
[01:34.490 --> 01:41.010]  Two cords touched that should not ever touch and dude, it made the most painful sound in
[01:41.010 --> 01:42.010]  my head.
[01:42.010 --> 01:43.010]  He crossed the street.
[01:43.010 --> 01:44.010]  I feel like we've been here before.
[01:44.010 --> 01:45.010]  We've been here.
[01:45.730 --> 01:46.730]  I'm going to put a tape or something or watch.
[01:46.730 --> 01:49.130]  I'll just move this over to here and we'll try to prevent that because dude, that was
[01:49.130 --> 01:50.130]  crazy.
[01:50.130 --> 01:51.130]  Man.
[01:51.130 --> 01:52.130]  Dude.
[01:52.130 --> 01:55.930]  I've heard the noise, but neither me nor Mike heard it.
[01:55.930 --> 01:56.930]  It was just you.
[01:56.930 --> 01:58.810]  It was laying right across my input right here.
[01:58.810 --> 02:03.970]  Just right across there and I looked and I was like, it was just going in my ears and
[02:03.970 --> 02:05.690]  I felt like it was happening in my body.
[02:05.690 --> 02:07.890]  I could feel it through my spine and shit.
[02:07.890 --> 02:11.370]  Guys, welcome to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:11.370 --> 02:13.530]  Stuff about cannabis and shit's going to happen.
[02:13.530 --> 02:14.530]  Holy crap.

[02:25.410 --> 02:29.570]  That song I started to play before I had a crazy great technical issue is from the Mystic
[02:29.570 --> 02:30.570]  Roots Band.
[02:30.570 --> 02:31.570]  I owe them a shout out.
[02:31.570 --> 02:32.570]  I'm way off rhythm.
[02:32.570 --> 02:35.050]  Let's read a podcast ad and we will get into the show here.
[02:35.050 --> 02:37.090]  Mike, don't spit that Mountain Dew on the computer, dude.
[02:37.090 --> 02:38.090]  It's so hard.
[02:38.090 --> 02:39.090]  You're going to ruin everything, man.
[02:39.090 --> 02:40.090]  You're going to ruin it.
[02:40.090 --> 02:41.090]  Jeez.
[02:41.090 --> 02:42.090]  Here comes another fun sound.
[02:42.090 --> 02:43.090]  Heads up.
[02:43.090 --> 02:44.090]  Uh-oh.
[02:44.650 --> 02:45.650]  I didn't know what he was going to do.
[02:45.650 --> 02:46.650]  You're just taking a big ass chug of that Dew.
[02:46.650 --> 02:47.650]  Mountain Dew number two.
[02:47.650 --> 02:48.650]  I want to take a-

[02:51.650 --> 02:52.650]  That's a good Mountain Dew.
[02:52.650 --> 02:53.650]  I want to take a dab.
[02:53.650 --> 02:54.650]  Oh, Hygro.
[02:54.650 --> 02:55.650]  There's a store in Pueblo called Hygro and their growing supplies.
[02:55.650 --> 02:56.650]  They have great prices on growing equipment.
[02:56.650 --> 02:57.650]  Well-organized shelves.
[02:57.650 --> 02:58.650]  Well-organized shelves and a couple of beautiful clerks.
[02:58.650 --> 02:59.650]  I don't know what they're called there.
[02:59.650 --> 03:00.650]  Sales associates.
[03:00.650 --> 03:01.650]  And Jesse is included in that.

[03:34.010 --> 03:35.470]  They've got a great, great store.

[05:06.570 --> 05:10.210]  Really hard to rob places through the mail.
[05:10.210 --> 05:11.210]  That's true.
[05:11.210 --> 05:12.210]  It's not going to be bad.
[05:12.210 --> 05:13.210]  That's true, especially when they're sending you poop.
[05:13.210 --> 05:14.210]  What did you get in the mail, Jimmy?
[05:14.210 --> 05:15.210]  A box of shit.
[05:15.210 --> 05:16.210]  A big old box of shit.

[05:17.210 --> 05:18.210]  Straight from the Rocky Mountains.
[05:18.210 --> 05:19.210]  The best shit on the market.
[05:19.210 --> 05:20.210]  That's the truth.

[06:14.450 --> 06:19.250]  Seriously I've seriously been considering an inverter for my car for the email dude

[08:45.710 --> 08:50.990]  It says one surprising downside of marijuana legalization major energy use and then there's a picture
[08:51.670 --> 08:56.630]  We got three to five like seven or eight lights hanging in a little growth facility here
[08:56.790 --> 09:01.130]  With the ballast up on the ceiling just to kind of show you a nice little visual of electricity being ran
[09:01.130 --> 09:07.630]  And then it says oh this article. I better give some credit here who Chris Mooney from the Washington Post wrote this
[09:08.230 --> 09:14.630]  He says across the country. There's a growing trend toward the legalization of marijuana four states, Oregon, Washington, Colorado
[09:15.190 --> 09:21.150]  Alaska have voted to allow people to possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal use and also to let producers apply for
[09:21.390 --> 09:23.390]  licenses to produce and sell it
[09:23.390 --> 09:25.390]  DC also just voted to allow
[09:25.590 --> 09:32.030]  Voted to allow personal possession all of this on top of the 23 states that allow it for medical reasons in some states
[09:32.470 --> 09:37.090]  We just read two different articles that gave me different numbers on that didn't we once said 21 said 23
[09:38.190 --> 09:41.730]  Maybe they were taking it different times. Maybe they're dabbing also hit dabs
[09:42.550 --> 09:48.110]  The the way this gets counted up is confusing because there's since that second Sanjay Gupta special
[09:48.110 --> 09:50.670]  There's been a whole bunch of CBD only skates
[09:51.270 --> 09:55.950]  Across the south and pseudo medical how you count that if you count that
[09:56.550 --> 09:59.810]  Like in the numbers a little hey, he was just about 25 now
[09:59.810 --> 10:05.870]  The guy that was making the big fuss in New Jersey was just in the news today wanting to go back at it like oh
[10:06.350 --> 10:08.350]  blood money
[10:09.350 --> 10:13.990]  Chris Christie being all fat and crazy. That's that should be just to be the governor of Florida, too
[10:13.990 --> 10:16.510]  So I mean like I've there's brother or something
[10:16.550 --> 10:21.190]  He's just another man who we're gonna be president order in the court in some states where businesses are
[10:21.310 --> 10:27.390]  Also now legally cultivating and producing marijuana a mainstream industry is emerging marijuana sales totaled
[10:28.270 --> 10:33.230]  $700,000,000 in Colorado last year for instance. Yeah, how much did you spend?
[10:35.310 --> 10:38.070]  The first three months that I was here yeah
[10:38.590 --> 10:42.670]  Posted a picture on Twitter the only time I bought legal pot last year
[10:43.190 --> 10:46.910]  First so I could pull up photo up and get exact 60 bucks
[10:46.910 --> 10:51.590]  So that was me. Yep about 125 on the first at the greener side dispensary
[10:51.590 --> 10:54.910]  But I've bought a lot of this shatter from green and healthy lately. Yeah
[10:56.030 --> 11:00.310]  2015 is gonna be a different tail, but we don't know that's a hard thing to let go, you know
[11:00.310 --> 11:06.310]  I just got all this black cherry chem done. I ran a lot of black cherry chem and it is tasty. It's very tasty
[11:06.310 --> 11:09.510]  It's a little heavy on the Indica side. So for daytime, it's a little bit much sometimes
[11:10.030 --> 11:11.590]  Can't glob out
[11:11.670 --> 11:17.630]  Alright, but let's see 700 million dollars in Colorado last year for instance, but there's a surprising catch
[11:17.630 --> 11:20.190]  it turns out that indoor marijuana growth in particular a
[11:20.550 --> 11:26.750]  cultivation method often favored in the industry for many reasons usings uses a surprising amount of energy
[11:27.150 --> 11:33.190]  Indeed the level of power use appears to be so significant that one scholar is now suggesting that as the industry grows
[11:33.470 --> 11:39.430]  States and localities should take advantage of marijuana licensing procedures to also regulate the industry's use
[11:39.870 --> 11:43.790]  Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions damn hippie
[11:44.670 --> 11:46.670]  this new industry
[11:46.710 --> 11:51.470]  Let's see given that this is a new industry that is going to be pretty highly regulated
[11:51.470 --> 11:57.030]  I felt like the state and local policymakers have a unique opportunity to incorporate energy usage and climate
[11:57.270 --> 12:02.550]  assessments into their state marijuana licensing fees says Gina Warren a professor at the Texas A&M University
[12:02.990 --> 12:06.910]  School of Law whose paper titled regulating pot to save the polar bear
[12:07.190 --> 12:12.590]  Energy and climate impacts of the marijuana industry will soon appear in the Columbia Journal of Environmental Laws
[12:13.990 --> 12:15.990]  Wow, that sentence was awesome
[12:17.030 --> 12:20.710]  Anybody else catch that you said pot and polar bears in the same
[12:21.670 --> 12:27.790]  Close together. It made some interesting pictures for I just saw a polar bear like running through a field of pot
[12:27.790 --> 12:32.450]  I give us yeah, I just thought that that was like an obstacle of a sentence to get through there were so many
[12:33.750 --> 12:35.470]  punctuation marks in that
[12:35.470 --> 12:41.990]  Project right now that whole paragraph was one sentence and get it started again that entire paragraph is one sentence
[12:41.990 --> 12:43.990]  Let's see. There's a comma a
[12:44.710 --> 12:46.190]  comma a
[12:46.190 --> 12:52.650]  Comma, so I wrote it a I don't even know what that is an ellipse and then another comma and then a period yeah
[12:52.650 --> 12:54.650]  There's so much punctuated. That's yeah
[12:54.750 --> 13:01.910]  Yeah, good writing props the published statistics on energy use from indoor marijuana production will blow your mind whether or not you use this
[13:02.350 --> 13:04.350]  In a
[13:04.550 --> 13:08.830]  carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production published in the journal energy policy
[13:09.070 --> 13:15.510]  Researcher Evan Mills noted that on occasion previous unrecognized spheres of energy used to come to light and marijuana is a textbook example
[13:15.990 --> 13:19.030]  The study estimated that indoor cannabis both legal and illegal
[13:19.590 --> 13:27.630]  uses six billion dollars worth of electricity every year amounting to 1% of overall US electricity and in some
[13:27.630 --> 13:33.630]  Production-intensive states like California. It was much higher 3% Mills found I haven't read into this article much further
[13:33.630 --> 13:36.630]  But I'm going to assume that Colorado is gonna hit like 5% of that
[13:37.030 --> 13:43.790]  Because we're killing it on the indoor grows. The only thing that would hold Colorado back from that would be there is less people here
[13:44.670 --> 13:46.350]  than something
[13:46.350 --> 13:49.790]  It's the percentage of our overall usage. Yeah. Yeah, all right, so
[13:50.270 --> 13:52.990]  one average kilogram a final product is associated with
[13:53.710 --> 13:59.710]  4,600 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere or that of 3 million average US cars when
[14:00.070 --> 14:02.550]  aggregated across all national production road mills
[14:03.070 --> 14:09.350]  The reason is simply the technique the technology required specific energy uses include high intensity lighting
[14:09.790 --> 14:16.030]  dehumidification to move to remove water vapor and avoid mold formation space heating or cooling during non illuminated periods and
[14:16.270 --> 14:23.950]  Drying preheating of irrigation water generation of carbon dioxide by burning fossil fuel and ventilation and air conditioning to remove waste heat
[14:24.070 --> 14:30.190]  Right smells. That's a well-researched. They did all that math and they haven't figured out how much
[14:30.710 --> 14:33.390]  Carbon dioxide the plants sucked back out that air
[14:35.190 --> 14:37.550]  There's an well no, but there's another side of that coin
[14:38.790 --> 14:40.630]  No, I agree with this article fully
[14:41.150 --> 14:46.990]  There's like there's a there's a little bit of subtraction that needs to be done before we freak out a little true that
[14:47.470 --> 14:49.990]  She keeps on going and she says Oh
[14:51.110 --> 14:54.350]  Where did I go outdoor production also has environmental consequences?
[14:54.350 --> 14:57.950]  It has been charged with deforestation and high levels of water and pesticide use
[14:58.070 --> 15:03.750]  But as pot becomes more legal and mainstream notes Warren outdoor producers will have to abide by pre-existing
[15:04.310 --> 15:09.510]  Environmental laws just like everyone else in effect. That means indoor production the chief climate change
[15:10.510 --> 15:15.670]  That makes indoor production the chief climate change and energy concern according to Warren's article
[15:15.670 --> 15:19.470]  Well underground indoor marijuana production already consumed plenty of energy
[15:19.950 --> 15:24.590]  Legalization will increase energy use even further as the industry grows. So will its negative
[15:25.310 --> 15:32.950]  Externality she writes which is why she's proposing that all states that legalize marijuana use should also require the growing industry to power itself
[15:32.950 --> 15:36.230]  Cleanly and it's not without precedent starting in October of this year
[15:36.750 --> 15:41.150]  Boulder County in Colorado will require many facilities to directly offset
[15:41.790 --> 15:49.270]  100% of electricity propane and natural gas consumption through renewables or other means that's a fun challenge
[15:55.510 --> 15:58.590]  Warren says she's not picking on the marijuana industry with her proposals
[15:58.670 --> 16:00.150]  It's just that well
[16:00.150 --> 16:05.550]  We don't often have new industries appear that use a lot of energy and are likely to be highly regulated as they become legal
[16:05.550 --> 16:09.590]  I think it could actually be a marketing tool for the industry says Warren
[16:09.690 --> 16:14.670]  Because if you have people who are purchasing the product who are the type of individual who cares about the environment
[16:14.670 --> 16:17.710]  Then they would gravitate toward the green marijuana
[16:18.310 --> 16:23.030]  Production what she's saying makes sense because we are sucking up a lot of power and I've thought about it
[16:23.030 --> 16:26.910]  I don't know how to do it. Maybe somebody can send me an email or something one thing I want to do
[16:26.910 --> 16:31.910]  I consider myself a pro grower. I could grow you can give me a plant that's half-dead and in 90 days
[16:31.910 --> 16:36.270]  I'll give you some tasty ass buds out of it. I can overcome most problems in a grow room now
[16:36.270 --> 16:38.270]  I want some guidance on how to
[16:38.550 --> 16:40.550]  Lessen my carbon footprint. I
[16:40.710 --> 16:46.590]  Recycle my soil, but still I have to run lights for 12 hours on and 12 hours off. There's no way around it
[16:46.590 --> 16:52.270]  Are there other things we can do to kind of lessen our carbon footprint if you guys know send me ideas
[16:52.270 --> 16:55.270]  You can tweet them to me. It's a at GF YH podcast
[16:55.790 --> 16:58.390]  You can email me. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[16:59.390 --> 17:03.110]  Interesting emails, yeah, well, I want to see I want to know how I cuz there's all kinds of
[17:03.910 --> 17:06.350]  Argument right now. I mean you would try to find those
[17:07.310 --> 17:08.710]  cannabis
[17:08.710 --> 17:11.390]  Cultivators would start looking for places like wine
[17:12.510 --> 17:17.430]  You know places they would right next to rivers where they can have a water bill
[17:17.430 --> 17:22.750]  Oh, I'm just talking about like my pre-existing indoor grow like people that have a home grow or a small warehouse grow
[17:23.030 --> 17:27.490]  Like I want to find out ways that people like us like you you've got a trap house grow
[17:27.490 --> 17:31.770]  I want to see a way that you can kind of make a little less in your electricity bill
[17:31.770 --> 17:35.490]  Just save you however much it is maybe cut 10% of that off. Absolutely
[17:35.490 --> 17:36.930]  Well, you could definitely do that with solar
[17:36.930 --> 17:41.930]  you know I'm saying like you're just cutting out the hundred dollars that it takes to run your house would be a
[17:42.450 --> 17:47.530]  Hundred dollars less over a year that would add up, you know tremendously. That's 15 to
[17:48.090 --> 17:52.570]  You know quite a bit a hundred dollars. What you try to do Matt right now right now
[17:52.570 --> 17:55.010]  It's $1,200, but I'm saying like, you know
[17:55.850 --> 18:00.690]  The local application of this is the city of Pueblo just required everybody grow indoors
[18:00.690 --> 18:05.330]  You can't grow outside not in any fashion this year in Pueblo. That's kind of silly
[18:05.370 --> 18:10.330]  Hopefully in a year will have greenhouse rules down here. But yet they cut it all out and
[18:10.970 --> 18:14.050]  But not until the very end. No, you're talking about it occur
[18:14.570 --> 18:20.850]  No, no, no, not even not even you can't put your purse outside. No, I six persons in my own backyard. It's illegal
[18:21.530 --> 18:26.150]  It's a it's a city that's what happens if you're not on the game
[18:27.490 --> 18:29.410]  Legal the Sun is not
[18:29.410 --> 18:31.690]  They're looking for more illegal pot grows here
[18:31.690 --> 18:37.010]  And now more than they were before we had legalized cannabis to tell you the truth because now they want to regulate the shit out
[18:37.010 --> 18:39.610]  Of it before they didn't have time now. It's an issue. All right
[18:39.610 --> 18:41.830]  I want to read which one do we want to do this one?
[18:42.490 --> 18:48.690]  Do you want to do the which one the good one? Well, they're both good brother cannabis. No, just fucking with you
[18:48.690 --> 18:50.690]  Do you want to read the one written by?
[18:51.410 --> 18:54.770]  They're both written by the same person sweet. We'll do that Cardo
[18:55.090 --> 18:58.970]  No, Kristen Wyatt actually is writing a lot. Do you want to do the one about racism?
[18:59.490 --> 19:02.090]  And drop in Colorado. I love that
[19:05.050 --> 19:09.410]  Legalized pot this is one of the this is from the cannabis. It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press
[19:09.410 --> 19:10.330]  Yeah, Alaska
[19:10.330 --> 19:15.210]  It says the legalization of marijuana in Colorado hasn't solved the racial disparities and enforcement that drug policy
[19:15.410 --> 19:21.370]  Reformers had hoped to end with blacks still far more likely than whites to be charged with pot related crimes a new report says
[19:21.530 --> 19:29.650]  The report issued Wednesday by the pro legalization drug policy alliance showed that marijuana arrests in Colorado all but stopped after voters made
[19:29.650 --> 19:32.650]  The drug legal in small amounts for those 21 and older
[19:32.650 --> 19:38.930]  But the report noted continuing racial disparities involving the marijuana crimes that remain including public use and possession
[19:39.370 --> 19:41.370]  in excess of the ounce limit
[19:41.850 --> 19:48.770]  Study the study examined drug arrests in all 64 Colorado counties for two years before and after legalization in 2012
[19:48.930 --> 19:55.810]  the total number of charges for pot possession distribution and cultivation plummeted by almost 95% from about
[19:56.450 --> 20:04.090]  39,000 in 2010 to just over 2000 last year. That's if it only takes an hour of the cops time
[20:05.010 --> 20:07.010]  That's 37 cop hours
[20:07.850 --> 20:13.530]  37,000 37,000 cop hours. We just reallocated to shit. That's worth something useful
[20:13.530 --> 20:19.450]  Yeah, they can be out solving a crime any crime looking for your bike that got stolen. Yep looking for something that bad happened
[20:19.450 --> 20:21.050]  I don't even want to create crimes in my head
[20:21.050 --> 20:25.930]  I have to say it has been nice like not worrying about the bag that's in my pocket. Yeah
[20:26.130 --> 20:32.130]  Yeah, it's beautiful in it. It honestly is you know, it's the only crime most marijuana consumers
[20:33.090 --> 20:37.290]  Longer than like traffic and fraction I wear my seatbelt don't speed like
[20:37.690 --> 20:41.790]  It's literally the only problem is once you pull me over. It's like here's the bag
[20:43.690 --> 20:48.650]  Smells like weed in there sure. Yes, sir. Just came from the dispensary, right? Yeah. Hope it smells good in here
[20:48.650 --> 20:50.810]  I paid a lot of money for that here. You can have my sweater
[20:50.810 --> 20:54.050]  Give me five minutes and then when you come back tell me it smells like weed in here
[20:54.050 --> 20:54.850]  Yeah, all right
[20:54.850 --> 20:59.490]  So I'm gonna keep reading because we want to get through a couple articles even after legalization blacks were more likely twice as likely
[20:59.490 --> 21:06.350]  Oh, sorry. I read that wrong blacks were more than I've I've stuttered because it's where we're saying blacks still
[21:07.130 --> 21:09.130]  American would be the correct turn
[21:09.130 --> 21:13.890]  Is a little harsh when I read it to but I'm not a member of the PC squad
[21:13.890 --> 21:17.710]  I didn't write this article. So if you want to complain that we're calling African American
[21:18.570 --> 21:22.970]  Doing it. That's yeah, you know, you've made it when you got those one or two guys
[21:24.610 --> 21:27.530]  You can send an email to Kristen what at the Associated Press
[21:28.250 --> 21:32.450]  She did that not me I found it slightly off-putting to tell you the truth
[21:33.250 --> 21:39.210]  Even after legalization African American folks were more than twice as likely as whites and whites
[21:44.810 --> 21:51.610]  This is oddly written you tell us community is it us or in the dabs or is it how it's written
[21:52.490 --> 21:59.690]  Are we the racist one or are they blacks were also more much more likely to be charged with illegal cultivation of pot or
[21:59.810 --> 22:01.810]  possession of more than an ounce
[22:01.930 --> 22:03.930]  legalization that
[22:10.370 --> 22:17.330]  Legalization is no panacea for the longtime issues that law enforcement had with the black and brown community said art way Colorado director for the drug
[22:17.330 --> 22:18.730]  policy alliance
[22:18.730 --> 22:24.050]  Still the drop-off and overall arrest is good news for minorities said Tony Newman also of the drug policy alliance
[22:24.530 --> 22:26.330]  despite the uprising
[22:26.330 --> 22:33.130]  Racial disparities the massive drops and arrests have been enormously beneficial to people of color Newman said is this
[22:33.570 --> 22:35.570]  Is this racist?
[22:36.050 --> 22:39.570]  The more I think we stopped referring to people by the general
[22:42.770 --> 22:45.490]  You know the term that I related to in there I
[22:46.490 --> 22:50.490]  Can't even know just based on it already past yeah, yeah
[22:50.490 --> 22:58.170]  It was the people of minority minority minorities well all right the analysis did not break out data for Colorado's largest ethnic minority
[22:58.610 --> 23:02.970]  Latinos that's because data comes from the national incident based reporting system system
[23:02.970 --> 23:08.110]  Which does not tally numbers for Latinos one of the region's top officials for coordinating drug enforcement
[23:08.270 --> 23:16.050]  Todd Gorman of the Rocky Mountain High intensity drug trafficking area program insisted that officers are not raped racially profiling pot users
[23:16.050 --> 23:18.050]  No, they're not there's calling them blacks and whites
[23:26.390 --> 23:28.390]  What does it mean that
[23:28.510 --> 23:32.830]  Rape laws weapon laws are racist there are other factors going on here that we need to address
[23:33.430 --> 23:36.830]  We don't tell us we got to stop fucking with the dark people
[23:37.230 --> 23:44.850]  After legalization racial disparities did ease somewhat for marijuana distribution charges blacks accounted for about 22% of such arrests in
[23:44.990 --> 23:51.550]  2010 and around 18% in 2014 the arrest data got a mixed response from the regional head of the NAACP
[23:52.150 --> 23:56.110]  Did the head of the NAACP know that you were calling them blacks when you wrote this article?
[23:57.790 --> 24:05.650]  The overall decrease in arrest charges and cases ignore is enormously beneficial to communities of color who bore the brunt of marijuana
[24:05.810 --> 24:08.730]  prohibition Rosemary Harris little said in a statement
[24:08.770 --> 24:09.290]  however
[24:09.290 --> 24:16.890]  we are concerned with the rise in a disparity for the charge of public consumption and chat and challenge law enforcement to ensure this reality is
[24:16.890 --> 24:22.090]  Not a discriminatory in any manner Wow that was hard to read in
[24:22.370 --> 24:29.010]  2014 the years the the year Colorado's recreational marijuana stores opened blacks were three point nine percent of the population
[24:29.170 --> 24:33.970]  But accounted for nine point two percent of pot possession arrests for illegal marijuana
[24:34.370 --> 24:38.630]  Cultivation this disparities didn't just persist they got much worse in
[24:39.170 --> 24:44.290]  2010 whites in Colorado were slightly more likely than blacks to be arrested for growing pot after
[24:44.490 --> 24:49.290]  Legalization the arrest rate for whites dropped dramatically, but ticked up for blacks in
[24:50.010 --> 24:56.190]  2014 the arrest rate for blacks was roughly 2.5 times higher. There's a lot more of this article, but I'm not gonna read it
[24:57.050 --> 24:59.190]  It's almost done, but we get the point
[24:59.710 --> 25:02.950]  I don't like the way it's written, and I just want to abandon
[25:03.630 --> 25:06.230]  I'm tired got a lot of really good information in it
[25:06.230 --> 25:11.510]  But it seems like it was written really really fast by somebody who wasn't really thinking meet that deadline in the 60s
[25:11.750 --> 25:13.750]  Like well, they still called
[25:15.510 --> 25:19.910]  Reporter but yeah, this strikes me as a little bit odd. Oh, yeah Mike tell me
[25:19.910 --> 25:21.910]  Do you just like all of his workers?
[25:21.910 --> 25:27.270]  It's a chick it's a lady. It's a female. I'm sorry to me to call her chick. That's right, but she's a reporter assigned to the
[25:27.270 --> 25:29.430]  Colorado marijuana I'm gonna take a drink of this water
[25:29.430 --> 25:32.430]  And then we're gonna read another article written by the same person and we're gonna try to
[25:33.430 --> 25:35.430]  This racist
[25:42.110 --> 25:48.430]  So fucking rude to me it did see like something like if we were in public you wouldn't want to say it full-throated
[25:48.430 --> 25:49.710]  I was just gonna ask you the back
[25:49.870 --> 25:54.310]  Just gonna ask you would you say that out loud at the mall like probably not but she
[25:55.230 --> 26:01.490]  Stated very that's how she would state it in a courtroom. You know I mean our politics there, but there
[26:01.490 --> 26:03.530]  I mean, let's just be real though
[26:04.070 --> 26:08.030]  I'm no civil rights person, but I don't I don't even want to be called the whites over here
[26:08.030 --> 26:10.030]  I got the whites and they're not the blacks
[26:13.030 --> 26:17.790]  Chose minority cuz I got long hair and that means you get pulled, but you're still a person like
[26:18.710 --> 26:24.310]  That's why I was trying to moral the story is pots almost legally for white here, and it's
[26:25.590 --> 26:31.750]  Yeah, but crime the arrests are down a lot, but it's still high for black people stay off Facebook
[26:31.750 --> 26:33.990]  I'm sitting there doing the math in my head. That's roughly
[26:35.110 --> 26:36.550]  22,000
[26:36.550 --> 26:40.190]  People of color that didn't get arrested or fucked with last year
[26:41.070 --> 26:45.230]  But still the data is so screwed up like we really need to restructure
[26:45.710 --> 26:48.790]  Most of how we enforce the laws guys
[26:48.790 --> 26:52.030]  I want your opinion on that article the people that are listening tweet me email me
[26:52.030 --> 26:54.590]  You know how to do it. I said it earlier. I want your opinion tweet
[26:57.310 --> 27:03.190]  Was it oddly written in a racist tone like I didn't like the way that is it racist to say it that way
[27:03.190 --> 27:06.470]  I didn't like it all right. I didn't like it, so I abandoned it
[27:06.470 --> 27:11.550]  We're gonna read another article this one the controversy Colorado bill seeks to standardize marijuana testing
[27:12.870 --> 27:14.870]  What I've noticed is a lot of people
[27:15.350 --> 27:20.590]  In Colorado don't trust the testing facilities anymore because we'll take a test to one lab and it'll come out at 22%
[27:20.590 --> 27:22.510]  You can take another test to another lab
[27:22.510 --> 27:23.470]  It'll come out at 29%
[27:23.470 --> 27:28.590]  and of course everyone's gonna start going to the lab that gets higher tests because you want to be able to brag about higher
[27:28.590 --> 27:30.590]  results so
[27:30.710 --> 27:33.870]  It's there's no real standard for the testing labs
[27:33.870 --> 27:37.290]  We can all just open our own lab pretty much and be like I got the testing labs
[27:37.290 --> 27:39.630]  It's just an email or a printed piece of paper
[27:39.630 --> 27:41.590]  Yeah, it's all you get a PDF
[27:41.590 --> 27:46.910]  And then you have to worry about if those high dollar people couldn't pay more for better testing right so
[27:47.430 --> 27:54.790]  Colorado is moving to establish another marijuana first the first government standards for marijuana testing a bill approved by its first committee in the state
[27:54.870 --> 28:00.330]  Legislature on Thursday would create a statewide laboratory standard for the state's 18 pot testing labs
[28:00.750 --> 28:03.310]  Currently the labs are certified by the state health authorities
[28:03.310 --> 28:08.910]  But they don't have uniform rules for testing pot potency homogeneity and contaminants as required by state law
[28:09.310 --> 28:14.230]  Lab owners say they need the standards because different labs now produce very different results
[28:14.590 --> 28:21.470]  Existing pot tests generally just look for whether the drug whether the drug is present not how strong it is in most industries
[28:21.470 --> 28:23.270]  There are long established
[28:23.270 --> 28:28.670]  Long established processes said Ian Berenger owner of a pot testing lab called rm3
[28:28.910 --> 28:33.230]  However for cannabis like most of the industry we're making up the rules as we go along
[28:33.230 --> 28:36.630]  I'm glad he admits that the labs can currently be used
[28:37.550 --> 28:40.830]  The labs can currently be used by licensed marijuana producers
[28:40.830 --> 28:48.870]  The bill was amended to remove lab access to private individuals and industrial hemp growers now covered in separate bills still pending in the legislature
[28:48.990 --> 28:55.070]  Which kind of bars me from getting my cannabis tested now the stuff that I used to grow up my private grow for my patients
[28:55.070 --> 28:58.230]  I was able to take that to the lab and get it tested and we could see what was in there
[28:58.230 --> 29:02.830]  And I think we all need access to that. I don't understand why they cut us off. This is not only that is
[29:03.470 --> 29:07.030]  This is the latest step in a dance that's been going on for 10 years
[29:07.550 --> 29:13.750]  like I remember we didn't have testing labs because the existing labs that had the equipment and the know-how are
[29:14.110 --> 29:20.750]  Banned from working with cannabis because they all require FDA and federal licensing. Yep. So we had to build these from the ground up
[29:20.750 --> 29:22.870]  I didn't know there were 18 of them in the state. That's pretty cool
[29:22.870 --> 29:23.910]  Oh, yeah
[29:23.910 --> 29:29.230]  So it says a separate bill advanced Thursday in a Senate committee would allow industrial hemp growers to use the labs to
[29:29.630 --> 29:33.710]  Colorado currently allows farmers to grow hemp marijuana is non-intoxicating cousin
[29:33.710 --> 29:39.750]  But only if the plants fall below a threshold for the plants intoxicating ingredient THC. It's not an ingredient
[29:40.710 --> 29:45.150]  However, the farmers can take their plants to a lab to make sure they're meeting the standard
[29:45.390 --> 29:50.590]  The testing bill creates what's called a reference library a standard set of protocols for testing pot
[29:50.950 --> 29:57.030]  The lab owner said the state needs to essentially referee all the methodologies that we're using
[29:57.310 --> 30:00.190]  We all understand the need to reveal the special sauce
[30:00.190 --> 30:07.470]  We've been using to further the industry Berenger said the bill now heads to a separate committee before consideration by the full house
[30:07.950 --> 30:10.310]  full house I used to watch that I
[30:11.150 --> 30:14.390]  Agree, this needs to happen do we need to know this is huge
[30:14.390 --> 30:20.090]  It's one of the beautiful parts of legalization is it's it's like everything else. These guys are the regulators
[30:20.090 --> 30:21.590]  They need to be regulated
[30:22.150 --> 30:27.550]  The testing labs for sure need to know what they're doing they only be using the same equipment plan by the same rules
[30:27.550 --> 30:33.750]  We're gonna start seeing reality in our testing like you can spot bullshit on the shelf if you're us
[30:34.390 --> 30:38.190]  Like I know your flower doesn't have 40% THC. Yeah
[30:43.190 --> 30:49.550]  A local shop that claims they have a 30% strain and I've seen it and it's mids. It is not 30%
[30:50.070 --> 30:52.950]  It's definitely not I know about the national
[30:53.990 --> 30:57.910]  Yeah, you remember the guy that was all hyped up about his 29%
[30:58.670 --> 31:00.670]  Yeah
[31:01.390 --> 31:05.790]  Yeah, I think so yeah the apple pie strain and we both took one look at it
[31:05.790 --> 31:09.070]  We both look at him. We both looked at us and it was like we tried not to giggle
[31:10.150 --> 31:15.710]  Yeah, we all saw each other's poker face right then definitely. Yeah, it was mids. Everyone knows when you shit the bed
[31:16.710 --> 31:20.350]  You can spot it on the rough trade to have just saying like
[31:20.830 --> 31:24.810]  But now with with these testing labs if we get them all standardized and regulated
[31:24.810 --> 31:30.310]  Then we won't have to worry like if you're like this hash was tested super clean and super high in potency
[31:30.390 --> 31:32.030]  I'm like, well, where'd you get it done?
[31:32.030 --> 31:36.110]  Did you get it at the place that you pay a lot more and they just give you really high results of them all?
[31:36.190 --> 31:38.350]  Yeah, or did you go to the place? It's pretty cool
[31:38.350 --> 31:40.590]  And like if you got a test at steep Hill, I trust you
[31:40.590 --> 31:45.670]  But I don't know any of the other places steep Hill gave me a tour of their facility and showed me what's going on
[31:45.950 --> 31:50.990]  They blew my mind all the other places you just give them a sample and they drive away and send you an email later
[31:50.990 --> 31:56.190]  They're not there. They're 100% cannabis to correct or yeah, that's all they test, right?
[31:56.190 --> 32:01.470]  So do your edibles and your right abs? Well, I'm just saying they're not another laboratory like oh, yeah
[32:01.470 --> 32:04.350]  We got we got science stuff in here science, bitch
[32:04.350 --> 32:10.230]  We'll do that to more and more important because we just required that all edible dosing be pretty much perfect
[32:10.230 --> 32:14.910]  Yeah, and you guys remember how that first regulatory check went through?
[32:15.030 --> 32:19.310]  Yeah, that was like episode 6. I think that was a long time ago. We talked about that. Yeah
[32:20.390 --> 32:25.070]  They had a hundred milligrams of THC and they had zero at appear what's going on? Yeah
[32:26.550 --> 32:29.150]  Kick a man for some fuck up last year. But yeah
[32:30.110 --> 32:32.910]  There were a whole bunch of companies that couldn't make it and then we had new
[32:33.190 --> 32:36.990]  rules that required that only ten milligrams of THC are in each
[32:38.110 --> 32:43.610]  Easily identifiable segment which meant no more 450 milligram fun size Snickers
[32:45.430 --> 32:48.830]  Rocky Mountain Medicine bar. Oh those things are so delicious
[32:48.830 --> 32:52.490]  Somebody showed me one the other day Maddie pulled one out of the fridge and she's like have you had these?
[32:52.990 --> 32:59.230]  The Mountain Medicine peanut butter bars 350 milligrams. I was like, dude, I ate one on the podcast. I almost floated out of the chair
[33:00.670 --> 33:06.830]  Speaking of which I want I want this 1200 milligram challenge like the 2500 milligram
[33:11.710 --> 33:13.750]  If you want me to Ralphie man, let's do it
[33:15.910 --> 33:20.910]  If that's the kind of night you really want if you guys don't know about the 2500 milligram challenge
[33:23.070 --> 33:25.310]  You gotta work up to it you don't just want to drop down
[33:26.230 --> 33:28.750]  No, yeah, I love how they put it on the
[33:30.390 --> 33:33.350]  Shit didn't really get done for a month, but it happened
[33:34.590 --> 33:39.030]  But like we're still paying it off. Yeah. Yeah. So it's something you got to work up to it
[33:39.030 --> 33:41.990]  I don't know if you want to do it guys. We're gonna wrap up the show. We did the news articles
[33:41.990 --> 33:46.350]  I want to talk about the growers meeting that is coming up at high grow indoor growing supplies
[33:46.350 --> 33:51.990]  You guys want to be at this you guys want to come? Hey, I made it the last one. It was fantastic
[33:51.990 --> 33:58.490]  Like just for the we didn't get a lot talked about but the community was we wanted definitely got red-eyed

[36:28.610 --> 36:33.450]  And I don't want to keep advertising it because the deadline for that for donations that may end by the time this episode goes up
[36:33.450 --> 36:36.330]  So I don't want to say that but there is a good cause there is a good cause
[36:36.410 --> 36:41.830]  Two donations of a hundred two donations totaling $100 will go to the cause I mentioned before. Yeah
[36:43.810 --> 36:47.110]  Doesn't go to the dabs. Yeah the first cause
[36:48.290 --> 36:55.410]  Either ends April 1st or May 1st, but we are collecting money for my daughter to go on an educational adventure in Hawaii
[36:55.410 --> 36:57.650]  She's a bright kid. She deserves this trip quite a bit
[36:58.290 --> 37:02.290]  Only like 30 kids in the whole nation were qualified to go on this
[37:04.130 --> 37:05.370]  For real
[37:05.370 --> 37:08.450]  I'm obviously well my phone just reset and I have a note on there
[37:08.450 --> 37:11.290]  I was gonna read at the end of the show there goes that I know you don't
[37:13.210 --> 37:15.890]  But uh, yeah, so that's where the funding is going it's going to my kiddo
[37:15.890 --> 37:20.170]  I'm trying to get her to Hawaii. It's gonna cost like four or five thousand bucks for this trip
[37:20.530 --> 37:25.690]  And yeah, I read genetics is a small business and I can't just pull that out of my ass to tell you the truth
[37:26.010 --> 37:31.290]  There are other things that require they're required like a plane ticket also. So yeah, it's just like the the class itself
[37:31.290 --> 37:36.250]  Yeah, you can't drive to Hawaii. Yeah, that'd be fun. Maybe if you have ever driven to Hawaii
[37:37.690 --> 37:39.690]  We want you on the show. Yeah
[37:40.250 --> 37:42.250]  But anyway hit that PayPal account
[37:42.530 --> 37:45.570]  That's gonna we'll have to find another worthy cause for that
[37:45.570 --> 37:49.930]  I need some new microphone covers here. These things are getting a little funky been spitting into these for a while
[37:50.330 --> 37:52.050]  There are a couple of adapters
