[00:00.120 --> 00:21.200]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen? It's time for episode number 32 of the iGrow Culture
[00:21.200 --> 00:24.920]  Podcast. It's your host, Ross DeGeff. Joining me today on the mic, we got our buddy Adam
[00:24.920 --> 00:27.640]  with us. How you doing, bro? I'm good, man. What's up with you?
[00:27.640 --> 00:31.960]  Hanging out, bro. Taking some dabs. I want to give a big shout out to our buddy, Mike.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.360]  Mike was supposed to come join us on the show today, but Mike, he hurt himself. He hurt
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.480]  his back, so he's laid up. He's taking a night off. Big shout out to Mike.
[00:39.480 --> 00:40.480]  Good. Feeling better, man.
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.200]  Get well, bro. We'll take some dabs for you. Also, on the last episode, I said that I was
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.480]  going to make videos of this podcast. Making a video is a big pain in the ass, and it really
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.520]  detracts from the quality of the show, in my opinion. I was too distracted by toys and
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.760]  equipment and I wasn't able to make a good podcast. So I've decided to not make videos
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.800]  of the show. What I will do is keep making cheesy-ass YouTube videos with iMovie and
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.560]  just put up videos that are mostly still shots. There'll be some video in there, but
[01:09.560 --> 01:14.520]  it'll mostly be stills of stuff that is involved in the podcast. I'll take pictures of rigs,
[01:14.520 --> 01:18.840]  pictures of plants, pictures of the guests, pictures of myself. It'll be stuff like that
[01:18.840 --> 01:22.800]  because doing a video really wasn't very fun. I'm going to fade out this music here. Big
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.720]  shout out to Cat and Coot and the Mystic Roots Band. Thanks for letting me play your music
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.760]  on the show. Really appreciate it. Make sure you guys follow the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.480]  Speaking of putting pictures of rigs up, man. I got a new rig today. Big shout out
[01:37.480 --> 01:43.400]  to at LSD Gallery on Instagram and also big shout out to at Slugworth. I think it's Slugworth
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.200]  Glass. I should have researched that, but check out Slugworth Glass, whatever they're
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.320]  called on Instagram. I will tweet a link to that so you can find them. I ordered the Master
[01:52.320 --> 01:59.840]  Shake Rig from LSD Gallery. It's a little smaller than I expected, but boy, do I approve.
[01:59.840 --> 02:05.160]  I came with this super awesome chainsaw dabber here. I think this little handle here, they're
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.760]  encouraging me to wear this as a pendant is what I think is happening. This rig is certainly
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.360]  designed to be worn as a pendant. This thing, I think Adam said, what is that? Three inches
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.440]  tall? About three inches. I would agree. That's about three inches tall, bro. I'm super satisfied.
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.880]  If you guys are looking for good glass that will get shipped to you at a reasonable price
[02:23.880 --> 02:27.640]  from good people that do good business. It's thick. The glass is thicker than it looks
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.840]  like it's going to be. It's nice and heavy. It's not clear, so you can't see the thickness
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.720]  of the glass. If you look at the straw and see even the handles and stuff, it is thick.
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.120]  Once you handle it, you appreciate it. This Master Shake Rig is stylish, super stylish,
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.920]  well worth every penny I spent. It got shipped here super quickly. It went out the day after
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.200]  I paid for it. I paid for it on Sunday. I got a tracking number when I woke up Monday
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.080]  morning. If you need glass, check them out. They're called at LSD Gallery. They're pretty
[02:56.080 --> 03:01.240]  fresh. Also, a big shout out to Task Rock because when I ordered my new rig, of course,
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.720]  I had to get... It's a little 10-millimeter rig. It's my first 10 mil. I like the bigger
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.520]  stuff, honestly, but this little one is cute and I love the way it hits. This will be my
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.800]  new... Just when I'm dabbing by myself, that'll be my new personal rig. Shout out to Task.
[03:13.800 --> 03:20.120]  I got myself a purple carb cap and a little 10-millimeter trinity nail to put on my rig
[03:20.120 --> 03:28.040]  and it works perfectly. Love it. Satisfied. Much respect. At LSD Gallery and at Task Rock
[03:28.040 --> 03:31.600]  and at Slugworth Glass. I'll have to research the Slugworth one.
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.320]  And at Highly Educated Titanium.
[03:33.320 --> 03:36.960]  Highly Educated Titanium. Make sure you check those guys out. Well, now that you're there,
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.200]  let's just do this. This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Highly Educated
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.600]  Titanium. If you're using high-quality concentrates like I know most of you are, you deserve a
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.160]  high-quality titanium nail made in America. Don't trust the Chinese knockoff or an American
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.840]  knockoff. You don't want that crap that's made out of cheap metals. Trust an industry
[03:54.840 --> 03:58.160]  leader. Trust our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[03:58.160 --> 04:01.680]  Highly Educated Titanium products are made for dabbers, by dabbers, right here in the
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.920]  United States of America. You can shake the man's hand. You can tell him your ideas. You
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.360]  can tell him thanks. It's somebody that we know, someone that's part of this industry.
[04:09.360 --> 04:13.680]  So big love, much respect to Highly Educated Titanium. If you want your own Highly Educated
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.680]  Titanium products, you can check out our friends at LSD Gallery. They have a limited selection
[04:17.680 --> 04:24.680]  available. Or for a big selection, check out AqualabTechnologies.com. They've got a lot
[04:24.680 --> 04:30.200]  of great, highly educated stuff in stock. If you're in Colorado, this place does not
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.480]  pay me, but dude, go check out Illusion's Glass on Broadway. We need to take... Adam
[04:36.480 --> 04:39.400]  hasn't been there. I feel bad. We've gone to Denver several times together, and I have
[04:39.400 --> 04:41.280]  not taken you to Illusion's. We got to do that.
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.400]  I'm probably in the market of purchasing a rig, so I may need a nail. I was going to
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.600]  ask you earlier where I can pick one up.
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.960]  Illusion's Glass in Denver does carry highly educated products. They have all kinds of
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.720]  sick glass. It's not just a glass shop. It's a gallery. That sounds like a written commercial.
[04:56.720 --> 04:58.240]  No, no. That sounds fun.
[04:58.240 --> 05:01.720]  It's fucking awesome. Yeah. Dude, I owe a dollar because I just said the F word again.
[05:01.720 --> 05:07.480]  You guys get me on that. Starting on episode 30, every time I say the F word, I owe a dollar,
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.840]  and you guys are going to hold me to that.
[05:08.840 --> 05:09.880]  To a charity.
[05:09.880 --> 05:12.800]  By the time we get to episode 35, I'll start doing $5 every time.
[05:12.800 --> 05:13.800]  All right.
[05:13.800 --> 05:15.080]  Yeah. I'm going to stop saying the F word.
[05:15.080 --> 05:17.160]  It slipped by me. I'll be more...
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.240]  There are some listeners that it does not slip by, so thank you guys for listening and
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.480]  making some money for the person that's sick that actually needs some money. It's a good
[05:23.480 --> 05:24.480]  way to do it.
[05:24.480 --> 05:25.720]  It's a great way to do it.
[05:25.720 --> 05:31.720]  Make sure you guys follow Task Rock on Instagram and Twitter. It's at Task Rock. Pretty simple
[05:31.720 --> 05:38.040]  there. Task, T-A-S-K, rock with a K, R-O-K. It's all one word, Task Rock. All right. Sorry,
[05:38.040 --> 05:41.040]  I'm fixing some sound levels here. I'm not happy with something. I got it. I figured
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.680]  out that knob right there. I'm picky, dude.
[05:42.680 --> 05:43.680]  It's all good.
[05:43.680 --> 05:44.680]  I'll turn up my headphones.
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.680]  You got to do what you got to do.
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.560]  Solve everything. Just turn up the headphones. You can't hear the mess. All right. This podcast

[07:17.520 --> 07:21.400]  to go on a travel. You hopefully are going to end up in South America. Bro, I wish you
[07:21.400 --> 07:25.240]  the best of luck. I'll miss you. I love you every day. And I hope to see you when you
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.840]  get back. Keep doing what you do with Tree Thugger because we count on you. For sure.
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.280]  For sure. He's got a big adventure set up for his life. I also read that. It sounds
[07:34.280 --> 07:38.680]  like an adventure is the right word. Yeah. Yeah. I wish him well. Him and his beautiful
[07:38.680 --> 07:43.520]  young lady. Hope you guys have a good time together. All right. So bro, you want to take
[07:43.520 --> 07:48.360]  a quick dab and then we will read some news. For sure. Guys, if you want to follow the
[07:48.360 --> 07:52.920]  show on Instagram or on Twitter, it's at Hygro Culture. If you want to follow our guest,
[07:52.920 --> 07:57.840]  he is at Overgrow the Gov. Sorry, I stumbled on that one. At Overgrow the Gov. You can
[07:57.840 --> 08:03.320]  find them on Twitter and Instagram. You can find me. I'm at Rostageff420 on Twitter, or
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.440]  you can follow at IryGenetics on Instagram and Twitter. I post a lot of stuff there.
[08:08.440 --> 08:11.680]  I know that's a lot of social media stuff, but that gives you some stuff to follow. If
[08:11.680 --> 08:14.440]  you're listening to the podcast, if you're killing time, you can look at at Overgrow
[08:14.440 --> 08:19.120]  the Gov, see the pictures he's posting. You can look at IryGenetics and see the weed plants
[08:19.120 --> 08:24.320]  I post. You can look at Hygro Culture and see a bunch of cannabinoid profile charts
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.400]  and stuff like that. Lots of stuff to check out. Also, I encourage you heavily to check
[08:29.400 --> 08:36.400]  out the forum on IryGeneticsColorado.com. I've got a forum there that is my website.
[08:36.440 --> 08:39.520]  You won't be censored unless you're a shit talker. I try to let everybody have freedom
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.960]  of speech. You can say what you want. It's not like Facebook. I'm not going to go and
[08:42.960 --> 08:46.560]  take down your stuff. I'm not going to make you use your real name. Facebook has been
[08:46.560 --> 08:51.220]  censoring people lately. Facebook has been taking down accounts that have fake names
[08:51.220 --> 08:55.720]  or not even fake names, just pseudonames. If I disappear off of Facebook, find me on
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.880]  the forum. Come join my forum. I'll answer all of your grow questions there. I've got
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.360]  a nice community of friends that are there. We post up our pictures. We post stuff about
[09:04.360 --> 09:07.880]  our gardens. I've been posting the notes from the podcast. If I type something out, like
[09:07.880 --> 09:12.240]  a long note, I'll actually put it there on the forum so people can check it out. I encourage
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.440]  you to interact with us. I love interaction. Of course, there's Facebook. Hygro Culture
[09:16.440 --> 09:20.200]  on Facebook. Yeah, it sounds like I'm just plugging the show again. We're going to take
[09:20.200 --> 09:23.320]  a quick dab and then we will be back for the news. While we take dabs, I'm just going to
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.320]  turn up the music. I got some Mystic Roots Band playing. I think this is $100 bag. I
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.040]  think so. I think it's $100 bag. We're going to take a dab real quick while this plays.
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.880]  Enjoy, guys. We'll leave the mics on so you can hear Adam cough.
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.080]  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. Speaking of which, I got to say a big shout out to
[09:45.080 --> 09:53.400]  Bender and 420th.com. They've been doing it while I'm away and held it down while I couldn't
[09:53.400 --> 09:58.600]  be on the internet and stuff like that. Big shout out to you guys. All the people back
[09:58.600 --> 10:05.600]  out east, we do not care. Murphysboro, you know who you are, man. Thanks for listening.
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.720]  Half of the guys from the 420th just found out that I've been on. They just thought I
[10:12.720 --> 10:19.720]  was spamming your podcast. It's like, man, pay attention. I was stoned when I wrote it.
[10:21.040 --> 10:28.040]  It should make a little bit of sense at least. All right. Here we go. The Chokefest. I owe
[10:29.920 --> 10:32.960]  a big shout out to Bender as well. Bender, if you're listening, thanks, bro. You made
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.040]  me three logos and all three of them look sweet as shit. I appreciate it. Keep them
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.840]  coming, bro. Keep them coming. We'll give you more shout outs on the show. It's the
[10:40.840 --> 10:45.760]  best I can do for now. In the long run, we'll make it up to you. We'll make it worth it.
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.400]  I appreciate it. He's a cool dude. I didn't ask for anything. He just volunteered and
[10:49.400 --> 10:54.040]  made me some pretty cool iRegenetics logos. Dude, how about an iGrowCulture logo that
[10:54.040 --> 11:01.040]  I can make a sticker out of? There we go. I'll put the request in. I'll just tell him
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.120]  don't even tell him just that way if he listens. We'll find out. We'll find out. That music
[11:06.120 --> 11:10.560]  was loud while we were talking. We're taking some dabs and stuff blasted by my good buddy
[11:10.560 --> 11:17.560]  at Garden of Weeden. Follow Garden of Weeden, Garden of Weed N on Instagram. Sorry, I'm
[11:19.280 --> 11:26.280]  coughing after a dab. Guys, I hope you're taking dabs with us while we're dabbing on
[11:26.840 --> 11:33.840]  the show. Using those highly educated nails. Yeah. We couldn't hit them. That's some tasty
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.800]  stuff. Isn't that tasty? I think it's some golden goat. We had to hit the hitman rig
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.720]  because hitting that little mini slugworth would just make us cough for an hour on the
[11:40.720 --> 11:47.720]  show. Big shout out to those guys. Which guys? The Garden of Weeden. I think that's what
[11:47.720 --> 11:54.720]  I was just saying. You said we were doing that. Big shout out to Garden of Weeden. Big
[11:54.760 --> 11:58.280]  shout out. I slipped. You were in dab world. That's okay. You had that dab bubble around
[11:58.280 --> 12:00.760]  your head. Adam's going to be all right, guys. We'll just give him a minute to catch up.
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.080]  You there? No, I'm here. You good? Yep. You good? Well, I mean, they also follow me on
[12:04.080 --> 12:07.680]  Instagram and stuff like that. You want us to call your mom? If you think it'll make
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.360]  the podcast better. That could be fun. We're sitting here with ... Can I say your line?
[12:12.360 --> 12:15.160]  Episode, yeah, sure. Miss G, we're sitting here with your son and he's dabbed the fuck
[12:15.160 --> 12:18.920]  out. I was wondering if you could just talk him down a little bit. Well, the thing is
[12:18.920 --> 12:22.440]  I'll sit here and I'll encourage people like, yeah, go follow and troll the shit out of
[12:22.440 --> 12:29.040]  her on Facebook, but I don't really care. You want people to troll your mom? It's whatever.
[12:29.040 --> 12:34.440]  That'd be funny. It would be. My mom doesn't have any social media and I'm glad about it.
[12:34.440 --> 12:37.600]  I'm pretty glad about it. Guys, we're just rambling. We're having a personal conversation
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.720]  because we just took dabs. I'd rather talk, have just some rambles that are incoherent
[12:41.720 --> 12:46.760]  instead of trying to read the news while I'm choking over here. A little intermission.
[12:46.760 --> 12:51.320]  This is going to go up probably Monday, I think. Yeah, it should go up Monday morning.
[12:51.720 --> 12:54.800]  How'd you guys like that bonus little miniature episode that I put out Thursday night? Was
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.720]  that cool or what? I've been trying to catch up. It's going to go out tonight. There's
[12:59.720 --> 13:03.680]  one as we're recording. I'll post another one when we finish. I know. And then we'll
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.960]  have this one going. So I'm getting ahead of myself. This is on Monday. I'm living in
[13:07.960 --> 13:11.840]  the future. You're living in the future. All right. I'm living. I'm going to live in the
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.520]  now. Guys, if you've got social media, if you've got Facebook, if you've got Twitter,
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.240]  if you've got YouTube, if you've watched TV in the past couple of days, you have seen
[13:21.240 --> 13:25.520]  the anchor lady guys. Excuse my dollar on this one. Come on. Don't charge me a dollar
[13:25.520 --> 13:30.600]  this one for this one. This lady went on TV and she made a nice long speech and her speech
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.040]  ended with fuck it. I quit. You guys know what I'm talking about, right? I'm going to
[13:35.040 --> 13:37.360]  read an hour. I wonder if I could play the video. Can I play the video and not get in
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.800]  trouble? It's on. It's from the news. Yeah. I mean the news played the hell out of it.
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.060]  They didn't get permission. Well, maybe they did. Let's turn down the music and let's try
[13:46.060 --> 13:50.140]  to play this video because I'm going to play a quick video and you guys, this happened
[13:50.140 --> 13:56.040]  on the news and then I'll read the story. Everything you've heard is why I'm the actual
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.760]  owner. Oh, it sounds like shit. I'm not even going to play it. Sorry. Well, uh, give me
[14:00.760 --> 14:03.460]  a second guys. I'm going to press pause. We're going to search for the actual good quality
[14:03.460 --> 14:07.720]  video and I'll play it for you. Hold on. I owe you that much. Give me a second. All right
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.560]  guys, I'm back. I did a little bit of searching. Uh, the video comes in kind of late. I should
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.960]  fill you in a little bit. This lady, the news ran a report about medical cannabis or cannabis
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.320]  in Alaska and this lady was reporting on it and then during her report, she states that
[14:24.320 --> 14:30.660]  she supports cannabis and that she actually is the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club.
[14:30.660 --> 14:34.040]  So this is kind of where just to pick, get you up to speed. So that's where she jumps
[14:34.040 --> 14:38.040]  in and I'll play the video now and hopefully they don't take it off of all of the servers.
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.600]  Now, everything you've heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club will
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.840]  be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.880]  legalizing marijuana here in Alaska and as for this job, well, not that I have a choice,
[14:52.880 --> 15:01.120]  but fuck it. I quit. So you heard it right there. We apologize. And then the next lady
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.480]  on the news, they screw all day. The camera pops back up to the other lady on the news
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.640]  and this lady, the other co-host looks like she pissed her pants when she said that. But
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.720]  so this lady goes on the news and she, uh, she's a news reporter and you heard it right
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.280]  there. She just said, fuck it. I quit live on the news. So I'm going to get into the
[15:17.280 --> 15:22.480]  article. It'll make a little more sense. Uh, fuck it. I quit. Anchor explains her dramatic
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.120]  exit and guys don't charge me a dollar for all of these. It's in the article. I'm just
[15:26.120 --> 15:32.080]  relaying the news, uh, that I read who it's by. I don't know if I said who it's by. It's
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.460]  by Molly Riley from the Huffington Post. I think I'm going to get me a dirty, nasty
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.580]  recycled jar to bring over here and sit on your table during these podcasts. Just for,
[15:43.580 --> 15:47.020]  yeah, just so you feel dirty, even dirty. And you had to put it like you have to stick
[15:47.020 --> 15:54.020]  it to the bottom of the jar. The F hit jar, the F jar. All right. So it says a local news,
[15:54.020 --> 15:58.220]  the local news anchor who dramatically quit her job on air following a segment on marijuana
[15:58.220 --> 16:04.260]  explained her exit and a YouTube video released Monday. Charlo Green, a reporter for Anchorage's
[16:04.260 --> 16:09.220]  KTVA announced on air that she would be leaving her job at the TV station to focus on marijuana
[16:09.220 --> 16:14.700]  legalization in Alaska. Uh, so like I said, they ran the clip about cannabis and then
[16:14.700 --> 16:18.940]  she says this, everything you've heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis
[16:18.940 --> 16:22.960]  Club will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.860]  with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska, she said. And as for this job, well, not that
[16:27.860 --> 16:33.300]  I have a choice, but fuck it. I quit. So that's where she stirred up a lot of controversy.
[16:33.340 --> 16:41.980]  Um, she, in my opinion, the attention should have been on, um, her advocacy, her support
[16:41.980 --> 16:48.380]  and her, uh, fight to legalize and support cannabis. Instead, she chose one wrong word
[16:48.380 --> 16:53.380]  on the air on TV and distracted it from all of what she was trying to do. She said the
[16:53.380 --> 16:58.300]  word that cost me a dollar on the air on TV. So that, uh, Adam pointed it out that that
[16:58.300 --> 17:02.420]  TV station is going to face a fine. Absolutely. The FCC is going to do something, even if
[17:02.540 --> 17:07.100]  it was early morning and there was very small numbers. Yeah. There's still, yeah, it could
[17:07.100 --> 17:13.460]  have, that looked like a normal FCC goes from like 2,500 to like, you know, 250, she'll
[17:13.460 --> 17:17.860]  probably end up paying the fine. Can they find her? Um, they may be able to do it, but
[17:17.860 --> 17:22.620]  still that was rude. And her choice of words distracted from her whole fight. It made her
[17:22.620 --> 17:27.580]  kind of look bad. She could have quit on air and probably sent a better message, but it
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.420]  wouldn't have been heard. It wouldn't have been heard so broadly. And I guess not have
[17:32.420 --> 17:37.740]  been heard by everybody. Since everybody has seen this on every, if the day it happened,
[17:37.740 --> 17:43.340]  I opened up my Facebook and it was all anybody had posted all day. So apparently she, she
[17:43.340 --> 17:46.700]  got herself popular the way she was trying to do, but I mean, she could have done a little
[17:46.700 --> 17:52.300]  bit better of a job. And there's also the, you know, I'm not saying that the marijuana
[17:52.300 --> 17:57.380]  business is going to fail, but maybe she hits a snafu and it kind of crumbles from underneath
[17:57.380 --> 18:02.260]  her. Maybe she trusts the wrong partner or there's some kind of illegal, there's all
[18:02.260 --> 18:06.460]  kinds of things that could happen. And from here on out, she's never getting a reporting
[18:06.460 --> 18:11.380]  job again. Oh no. You know, you're never getting on any kind of cable access, let alone, you
[18:11.380 --> 18:15.300]  know, making a comedy show, you know, maybe that she can come on our podcast whenever
[18:15.300 --> 18:19.060]  she'd like. Oh, there you go. There's the open invitation. Yeah. All right. I'll keep
[18:19.060 --> 18:22.580]  going with the article. Uh, in the YouTube clip green explained why she believes the
[18:22.580 --> 18:27.380]  fight for marijuana legalization in her home state is so important. There comes a time
[18:27.380 --> 18:31.740]  in each and every one of our lives where we must choose to continue to spectate or stand
[18:31.740 --> 18:36.740]  up for what's right. She said, why are Americans arrested every 30 seconds, Alaskans, every
[18:36.740 --> 18:42.140]  4.3 hours. Why should an aspiring someone lose their ability to earn a higher education
[18:42.140 --> 18:46.020]  to become someone they were not meant to be? And why should you lose the ability to get
[18:46.020 --> 18:52.060]  public assistance in times of struggle and need? She continued advocating for freedom
[18:52.060 --> 18:56.340]  and fairness should be everybody's duty. I'm making it my life work to uphold what
[18:56.340 --> 19:01.340]  America stands for truly life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Ideals now need
[19:01.340 --> 19:09.300]  to be defended. I kind of agree with her there. I agree with her, but as I've been told numerous
[19:09.300 --> 19:17.420]  times throughout my life, it's not what you do. It's how you do it. And as hearing it
[19:17.420 --> 19:21.140]  over and over again, as you shouldn't have said F you shouldn't have said, fuck, you
[19:21.140 --> 19:25.500]  shouldn't have said this. You know, I hear it constantly, but if that's the type of person
[19:25.500 --> 19:30.620]  who you are and you're able to stand up to that scrutiny, I'm I'll back that, you know,
[19:30.620 --> 19:34.460]  I'm not the type of person to bite my tongue, especially if you cross me and I felt like
[19:34.460 --> 19:42.000]  I haven't done anything wrong. Um, so if they were going to fire her, fuck that company,
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.460]  you know, 100% they weren't going to fire her until she said that she owned that cannabis
[19:46.460 --> 19:50.780]  club and why she was legit anyway. She's got a backup job. So she could have just said,
[19:51.420 --> 19:55.820]  that's probably my last report. So it was nice seeing you guys have a good night instead of
[19:55.820 --> 20:00.460]  fuck it. I quit. Yeah, for sure. But it wouldn't have blown up. You had the opportunity. Yeah.
[20:00.460 --> 20:03.620]  It wouldn't have blown up. And if you had the opportunity to go on the news in front of camera,
[20:03.620 --> 20:07.460]  would you rather say, and tonight I respectfully design or would you rather be like, you suck,
[20:07.460 --> 20:13.500]  you suck, you suck. Fuck it. I quit. Yeah. You just, yeah. So me, yeah, for sure. You know,
[20:14.060 --> 20:20.940]  you being my friend would kind of stand back and say, yeah, don't be you. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
[20:20.940 --> 20:25.500]  So the last line of the article says Alaskans are set to vote on ballot measure two, which would
[20:25.500 --> 20:31.020]  legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use in November, Colorado and
[20:31.020 --> 20:35.740]  Washington have implemented similar legislation in the last year. What the fuck have they been
[20:35.740 --> 20:40.860]  doing up there? They've made it against the law to like drink in separate counties. That was ballot
[20:40.860 --> 20:46.620]  initiative one. I'm guessing and ballot initiative two is to maybe legalize marijuana. Dude, did you
[20:46.620 --> 20:52.540]  hear the ratio a minute ago when it was like every 30 seconds and American is rested in, in, in,
[20:52.540 --> 21:00.300]  in for pot and every 4.3 minutes in 4.3 hours in Alaska. What a big fucking ratio. What are they
[21:00.300 --> 21:05.980]  doing up there? Arrested moose? Like, Hey, get out. They're all after the moose knuckles.
[21:06.220 --> 21:12.940]  Moose knuckles. Well, yeah. Well, hopefully they legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana
[21:12.940 --> 21:17.820]  for recreational use in November. That would be frigging awesome. They would give us a lot
[21:17.820 --> 21:24.940]  less to watch on Alaskan state troopers. Oh yeah. All right. So guys tweet me what you think about
[21:24.940 --> 21:28.300]  this. Like, you know what? I've seen so much about it. I know what you think about this lady. If you
[21:28.300 --> 21:32.620]  have more to contribute to our conversation, let me know. I'd be glad to hear it. Add to it,
[21:32.620 --> 21:38.060]  add to the conversation, keep the conversation going. Uh, did she screw herself by using the
[21:38.060 --> 21:41.900]  language she did or did she actually help herself out by using that language? That's what I want to
[21:41.900 --> 21:46.620]  know. Please comment because see, I'm on the border of, uh, I'm down with saying, fuck it.
[21:46.620 --> 21:51.740]  I quit. But then all of my friends who have respectable businesses and, and respectable
[21:51.740 --> 21:58.060]  things would be like, no, you really should. And it's usually afterwards, you know, it's usually
[21:58.060 --> 22:03.100]  at this point in time where we're talking now. So probably shouldn't have done that, bro.
[22:04.220 --> 22:10.140]  How many times have I said that to you? You, you preemptive strike a lot, a lot more than my
[22:10.140 --> 22:15.820]  parents did. I'll tell you that much. It took you a lot less time to figure it out. And I'm good
[22:15.820 --> 22:20.700]  after that, right? Yeah. Once I say, bro, do you realize that you're just about to put nitro and
[22:20.700 --> 22:24.860]  glycerin in the same container and shake it up? Do you see that coming? Then you go, Oh yeah,
[22:25.420 --> 22:30.700]  I have nitro and glycerin in the same container. But once I've warned you, you're pretty on it.
[22:30.700 --> 22:36.620]  I have been guilty to fail. You know, you got to fail to learn how many, if you try stuff and you
[22:36.620 --> 22:40.540]  do it perfectly, you're like, I'm fucking good at that. I owe a dollar for that one. But if you do
[22:40.540 --> 22:44.300]  something and you fail, you're like, boy, I'm humbled. I really failed. I gotta learn how to
[22:44.300 --> 22:48.940]  do this. Right. Yeah. You don't learn anything the first time you get stuff. Right. I agree.
[22:49.660 --> 22:55.420]  So where'd that article go? Where is it? Here it is. Adam actually brought this article to
[22:55.420 --> 23:02.540]  my attention. It's written by Jeremy P. Meyer. We found this on the Denver post.com. It says,
[23:02.540 --> 23:07.260]  Colorado schools out millions due to marijuana excise tax loophole.
[23:09.100 --> 23:14.460]  Well, it's not, they're not out. This sounds like they had millions in their pockets and somebody
[23:14.460 --> 23:17.740]  reached in and took it out. That's not the way this went. That's the way I read it.
[23:17.740 --> 23:21.500]  Yeah. I read this article. It's a little misleading, but they have to do that with
[23:21.500 --> 23:25.980]  headlines to get you to read it. The schools did get kind of punked a little bit, but it wasn't
[23:25.980 --> 23:31.260]  a loophole. It was a business move and it wasn't aimed at, nobody was like, let's screw the schools.
[23:31.260 --> 23:34.540]  Nobody did that. It was just what business people were doing because it's how business
[23:34.540 --> 23:39.500]  was being done at the time. How the law was wrote. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it says a loophole
[23:39.500 --> 23:44.060]  built into Colorado's marijuana system has allowed thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed and has
[23:44.060 --> 23:49.180]  cost the state millions of dollars that should have gone to school construction fund. In 2012,
[23:49.180 --> 23:54.220]  Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved amendment 64, which among other things promised that the
[23:54.220 --> 23:59.740]  first $40 million in excise tax revenue would be dedicated every year for the state school
[23:59.740 --> 24:04.700]  construction fund. But this year only about $10 million is expected to be raised. Thanks to a
[24:04.700 --> 24:10.700]  rule that allows marijuana retailers to avoid paying the tax in a one-time transfer of wholesale
[24:10.700 --> 24:16.940]  pot. Sure. Sorry. I had to clear my face there. Surely revenue will increase over time as the
[24:16.940 --> 24:22.060]  industry continues to mature and fewer license holders are able to use the one-time tax-free
[24:22.060 --> 24:25.980]  transfer. So what they're able to do, I haven't read far enough into the article here, but what
[24:25.980 --> 24:30.780]  they're able to do, shops that have medical marijuana are able to move it from their medical
[24:30.780 --> 24:35.660]  marijuana side to the recreational marijuana side to make it available for everybody instead of just
[24:35.660 --> 24:41.900]  medical patients. But there must be a tax paid when that happens because the taxes are different
[24:42.780 --> 24:48.700]  on the medical side and the rec side. And Colorado tried to protect the medical side a little bit by
[24:48.700 --> 24:54.860]  doing this, but in my opinion, it has failed. So I'll continue into the article. Whether the excise
[24:54.860 --> 25:00.300]  tax revenue will ever reach 40 million is anyone's guess. My suspicion is the amount will never be
[25:00.300 --> 25:07.580]  attained as and was a pie in the sky figure meant to attract voters. If that sounds familiar, you may
[25:07.580 --> 25:13.820]  be remembering the 2008 campaign for amendment 50 that promised 182 million over five years to
[25:13.820 --> 25:19.500]  community colleges from the expansion of gaming. However, only 25.3 million has been generated
[25:19.500 --> 25:25.020]  through the fiscal year 2012 to 2013. Half the people are spending their money on pot.
[25:25.660 --> 25:31.260]  The marijuana tax revenues would certainly grow if the loophole that was created by regulators to
[25:31.260 --> 25:36.380]  launch the industry was closed. There are still 275 license holders who could take advantage of
[25:36.380 --> 25:43.260]  it according to one source. The loophole was created to make sure enough pot would be in the
[25:43.260 --> 25:49.580]  retail marketplace when doors opened on January 1st, 2014. Regulators allowed medical marijuana
[25:50.540 --> 25:55.340]  marijuana licensees converting to retail a one-time tax-free transfer.
[25:56.780 --> 26:00.300]  That transfer was a big difference between Colorado and Washington,
[26:00.300 --> 26:02.540]  the other state that legalized retail marijuana.
[26:05.180 --> 26:08.140]  And why the... Sorry, I had to reread that sentence because it looked weird to me. Some
[26:08.140 --> 26:13.340]  didn't sound right, but okay. That transfer was a big difference between Colorado was the big
[26:13.340 --> 26:16.940]  difference is what it should say between Colorado and Washington, the other state that legalized
[26:16.940 --> 26:21.820]  retail marijuana and why the Centennial State was out the door first. Washington had to grow
[26:21.820 --> 26:31.180]  its retail crop from seed. Colorado officials say 9,711 pounds of medical pot was transferred tax
[26:31.180 --> 26:39.420]  free to retail stores. 4,724 pounds of medical marijuana was moved to retail marijuana products
[26:39.420 --> 26:46.620]  and manufacturers and 8,576 pounds of medical pot was transferred to retail marijuana cultivation
[26:46.620 --> 26:53.980]  facilities. That last trench will be subject to the tax once it is transferred or sold to another
[26:53.980 --> 27:00.460]  marijuana establishment. Yeah, there will be taxes made on this, just not that original transfer tax.
[27:00.460 --> 27:05.900]  So it says it is estimated the untaxed pot would have provided $3 million for the state school
[27:05.900 --> 27:10.860]  construction fund or twice what the fund received in the fiscal year. Kathy Gerbhardt, a member of
[27:10.860 --> 27:15.340]  the public school capital construction assistance board. That's a lot of words for a board.
[27:16.300 --> 27:21.660]  Yeah. Provide the board that provides grants for schools, construction and renovation,
[27:21.660 --> 27:24.620]  knew the numbers were going to be low after seeing February's receipts.
[27:25.580 --> 27:29.500]  The first month we were thinking we were going to be rolling in cash, she said. Then the second
[27:29.500 --> 27:33.660]  month it was, wait a minute, we're only getting fractions of what we thought we were going to get
[27:33.660 --> 27:40.620]  in. This was not the voter intent, she said. I don't think anyone who voted for Amendment 64
[27:40.620 --> 27:45.820]  thought this would happen, she said. They thought the money would go to school kids.
[27:45.820 --> 27:52.940]  This is coming at the expensive kids in really needy school districts. Sorry, the text is broken
[27:52.940 --> 27:57.820]  up oddly with ads here. Sorry. The building excellent schools today or best fund is a
[27:57.820 --> 28:02.860]  competitive grant program that helps districts with capital construction. It is able to support
[28:02.860 --> 28:07.420]  projects in rural school districts that don't have large property bases necessary for bond projects.
[28:07.980 --> 28:13.020]  The best fund over the years has received more than $385 million in revenue,
[28:13.020 --> 28:19.020]  90% from the state land trust. This year, the best fund is helping construction buildings
[28:19.020 --> 28:24.140]  in the Edson 54 JT school district and supporting projects in dozens of school districts around the
[28:24.140 --> 28:29.260]  state for things like roof replacements and boilers. Marijuana taxes are providing less
[28:29.260 --> 28:35.900]  than 1% of the program's funds or $3.1 million. It would have made a big difference, she said,
[28:35.900 --> 28:40.540]  whether there is a tax credit on the other side, there is somebody to whom the tax credit should
[28:40.540 --> 28:48.620]  have gone. Proposition AA, which was approved by voters in 2013 mandates a 15% excise tax
[28:49.980 --> 28:55.980]  imposed on unprocessed retail marijuana. Amendment 64 says no excise taxes can be
[28:55.980 --> 29:01.260]  charged on pot cultivated as medical marijuana. A transfer logically of medically grown pot
[29:01.260 --> 29:05.980]  couldn't be taxed, which is the basis for the loophole. The simple solution then is to
[29:05.980 --> 29:10.780]  discontinue transfers. The state doesn't need them anyway. The retail pot industry is up and
[29:10.780 --> 29:16.460]  running now and doesn't need the influx of medical pot to prop up retail stores. Plus, transfers
[29:17.180 --> 29:22.140]  disadvantage retail growers who have to pay the tax when medical growers don't for that one-time swap.
[29:23.660 --> 29:26.940]  It was never our intent to manipulate the market, said Rep Dan Pabon.
[29:27.660 --> 29:32.860]  It's correct. It's a correction that needs to be made. He said also a draft bill already had
[29:32.860 --> 29:39.020]  been written that would stop the transfer after January 1st, 2016, but the loophole should be
[29:39.020 --> 29:44.380]  closed sooner to match the voters intent and make good on a promise that the revenue should be going
[29:44.380 --> 29:52.780]  to schools. I agree. Yeah, the revenue should go to the schools, but where's the other money going?
[29:52.940 --> 30:04.300]  Like if, why did it get exempt from the schools? If I understand 40 million, 40 million sounds like
[30:04.300 --> 30:11.500]  a lot, just that money. They said, when we not make 40 million in like the first 48 hours,
[30:13.340 --> 30:19.260]  maybe in total sales, maybe, but then what they're saying is this tax that they had this tax set up,
[30:19.260 --> 30:23.260]  this tax was supposed to go here and the money didn't happen because these guys found a way to
[30:23.260 --> 30:29.420]  not make the money. We had that. You read that article not that long ago where it was 1.9 tax,
[30:29.420 --> 30:35.340]  $1.9 million of taxable money from this county alone. Right. Well, that was that's set up to go
[30:35.340 --> 30:39.580]  to different places. This fund, this one is the one that didn't happen because they said this
[30:39.580 --> 30:43.820]  money right here specifically. That's just bullshit. Why they get who, who was the one
[30:43.820 --> 30:48.700]  was like, yeah, cut the kids out. You know, like in the council was like, I got a good idea. That's
[30:48.700 --> 30:51.900]  what I'm saying. They didn't, that's, it wasn't even aimed to do that. It's just kind of, this
[30:51.900 --> 30:57.180]  rule was set up to help them have enough herb for when the shops opened. But that was also, they
[30:57.180 --> 31:01.180]  said when this money's made, it's going to the schools, but then it just didn't get made. They,
[31:01.180 --> 31:06.700]  nobody was really like, fuck that fund. Fuck those kids. That's $2. Nobody was really like that. It's
[31:06.700 --> 31:11.180]  just, that's just how it worked out that they found a way around that. Like, if I told you,
[31:12.060 --> 31:16.780]  it would be nice if they were like, all right, this is, we, we caught, we were expecting,
[31:16.780 --> 31:23.020]  you know, maybe a hundred million dollars for the first year. And they just said, you know what,
[31:23.020 --> 31:28.620]  we'll have the best schools anywhere. You know, there's a here, just take this next year's us,
[31:28.620 --> 31:35.420]  you know, we'll, we'll divvy it up, but there's why not, you know, drop that common core shit
[31:36.460 --> 31:43.740]  and get on with your fucking lives. Tell the rest of the country that you were the high ones. Yeah.
[31:43.740 --> 31:52.220]  Yeah. We're not going to do that. I kind of agree that they should change the rule by 2016.
[31:52.220 --> 31:55.580]  Uh, they're right. If the shops are doing it right, they don't need to move herb around.
[31:56.780 --> 31:59.580]  And if you're growing medical herb, it needs to be there for the patients.
[32:00.620 --> 32:06.620]  Yeah. So they didn't really purposely screw the kids out. That's just how, like, if I told you,
[32:06.620 --> 32:10.620]  if you drive around the block every day on your work, you don't have to pay the $3 toll fee,
[32:10.620 --> 32:14.460]  but that $3 toll toll fee goes to the skit, to the school kids. You'd still drive around the
[32:14.460 --> 32:17.900]  block. You wouldn't give a shit about that $3. And that's kind of what they did. They just drove
[32:17.900 --> 32:21.740]  around the block. They didn't really, they didn't go take the three bucks and stab somebody for it.
[32:21.740 --> 32:27.500]  And they just skipped paying it. They figured out how of this whole taking medical and taking it
[32:27.500 --> 32:33.900]  recreational. Um, I went out to the shop the other day. I won't say which one, but it was for their
[32:33.900 --> 32:41.820]  special. There was nothing on the medical side, zero. And they're like, well, you can choose from
[32:41.820 --> 32:50.300]  the recreational. There was literally four kinds and it was all sativa heavy, 70%. You know, who
[32:50.300 --> 32:53.740]  knows what they're talking about? I'm pretty sure I know what shop you went to. And they've recently
[32:53.740 --> 32:59.020]  opened up another location North of here. And I have a friend who stopped there just the other
[32:59.020 --> 33:03.260]  day and they were hopping and the place was full and had all kinds of great shit. So what they've
[33:03.260 --> 33:07.980]  done is they've taken all their products and their Pueblo West location. No, it's full like,
[33:07.980 --> 33:14.060]  Oh, Oh, maybe they're there. They're marijuana. Yes. But, uh, they, they had a whole shelf of
[33:14.060 --> 33:20.300]  shatter, a whole bunch of new extracts and things like that and all kinds of other stuff except for
[33:20.300 --> 33:26.780]  bud. And it was their special day. And I was in there like 11 o'clock, you know, it's yeah,
[33:26.780 --> 33:32.140]  the shops need to get it together. In my opinion, for sure. I'm just saying that affected us,
[33:32.140 --> 33:36.540]  you know, that affected us here locally that affected me, local patients. Yeah.
[33:36.540 --> 33:41.980]  That's so why that really sucks is because as a medical on the medical side, the herb
[33:41.980 --> 33:49.260]  is cheaper to just to start. Um, it's considered medicine. It's, it's not even,
[33:50.540 --> 33:55.500]  you know, I, I, I'm not going to lie about it. I have it for not strangling my wife and children
[33:55.500 --> 34:00.460]  don't say that on there for stress relief. But so on the medical side, it's a little bit cheaper
[34:00.460 --> 34:05.020]  to start with on the recreational side, they charge you more than on the recreational side,
[34:05.020 --> 34:10.860]  they add a tax to it. So let's just move the same product from the recreational star from the
[34:10.860 --> 34:15.500]  medical side, right over to the recreational side, mark it up 10 bucks and eighth more screw the
[34:15.500 --> 34:19.980]  medical patients at more than that 15 bucks an eighth more half it's half the price more.
[34:20.780 --> 34:25.420]  So, so yeah, just mark it up way high, charge an extra tax for it. And then don't even care
[34:25.420 --> 34:29.420]  about the medical patients anymore. How can a shop do that? How can a business owner do that
[34:29.420 --> 34:34.940]  and look his patients, his customers in the eye? Whoa, whoa, whoa. They give you priority over the
[34:34.940 --> 34:40.220]  rec patients. That means the rec patients can just sit out there and have red card patients come in,
[34:40.220 --> 34:46.060]  come in, come in and they do. And they just sit there. So if you got, that's the only thing you
[34:46.060 --> 34:49.820]  get though, right? Is that red card priority, then they should take you into the red card side
[34:49.820 --> 34:54.460]  and take care of you properly. Pablo, they won't let them open up the, they, they already bought
[34:54.940 --> 34:59.660]  the location next to him, had it all worked out with the owner and the city came in and says,
[34:59.660 --> 35:05.820]  hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And they're like, what do you mean? No,
[35:05.820 --> 35:10.140]  we're doing banging business. And that's right there, you know, perfect location. And they're
[35:10.140 --> 35:15.100]  like, yeah, but you're not spreading that more of that. We got enough. There's 12 of them right here.
[35:16.300 --> 35:20.380]  They put a stop to that and I'm sure to the North, huh? You'll have to let me know, but
[35:20.940 --> 35:25.820]  I don't know. Go up there. Uh, you want to go to dinner tonight? Sure. Let's go on a 45 minute
[35:25.820 --> 35:32.220]  drive from here. I'm dude. I'm one of the dankest dude. Can we please go? I'm fucking for real. You
[35:32.220 --> 35:36.780]  got to walk in the morning. I'd fuck that. You'll you'd be able to do it. It's 11 o'clock. It's a
[35:36.780 --> 35:40.860]  guru crack. I'll go and I'll even throw in 10 bucks on gas. Oh, I think we're going to go eat
[35:40.860 --> 35:46.940]  at this place in Manitou Springs. Fucking her. And let's go. The Mate factor in Colorado Springs is
[35:47.900 --> 35:52.540]  amazing. I'm going to go there and spend money. She's going to be at two Springs,
[35:52.540 --> 35:56.460]  the Monte factor in Manitou Springs. Please go there. The most amazing veggie wrap,
[35:56.460 --> 36:00.940]  get the veggie wrap with the house dress. Oh no. And the cheese sandwich. Oh, if you want
[36:00.940 --> 36:04.460]  something cool, get the veggie wrap. If you want something hot, get that cheese deluxe.
[36:04.460 --> 36:08.140]  Do you remember what was in my coffee? Dude, I don't drink the coffee. I know, but he,
[36:08.140 --> 36:12.300]  it was something weird and fancy. And I can't remember. Uh, I like the Jasmine. Maybe the
[36:12.300 --> 36:16.220]  dark roast Mate is amazing. If you're going to drink something from there. I got a nice coffee
[36:16.220 --> 36:20.540]  from there and it was good. So anyways, plug. All right, let's just wrap up the show and we're
[36:20.540 --> 36:24.460]  going to go to Manitou Springs and eat at the Monte factor. It was good talking to you guys.
[36:24.460 --> 36:29.180]  Yeah, I've got one more news article. Um, where did it go? I have two on the screen. One of them
[36:29.180 --> 36:32.380]  is really long. We've been going 35 minutes. I feel my throat getting a little itchy. So we're
[36:32.380 --> 36:37.660]  going to do one article and then really possibly drive to Manitou. We'll see what our friend is
[36:37.660 --> 36:44.860]  doing. Shout out. Yeah. Shout out to the person that introduced me to the Monte factor for that.
[36:46.220 --> 36:51.340]  All right. So here's another news article. This one was sent to me by our good friend,
[36:51.340 --> 36:55.900]  Mike, who was laid out tonight. Mike heard his back. Mike's a big dude to have a hurt back.
[36:55.900 --> 36:59.100]  That's got to suck. Shout out, bro. Take care of yourself. Get better. I wish you were here
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.780]  doing dabs. Yeah. Dabs would help you out. He said he couldn't even get in his car. I mean,
[37:02.780 --> 37:06.940]  it probably wouldn't if he heard his back because the, the lung thing, because he coughs. Yeah. Mike,
[37:06.940 --> 37:10.780]  you like to cough bro. You guys had smoked cigarettes and take dabs. You took so hard.
[37:10.780 --> 37:15.100]  You got to quit that, man. Yeah. We got cigarettes or the Mike, you know, we can smoke all the weed
[37:15.100 --> 37:23.260]  we want. Why are you smoking cigarettes? I know, man. I'm sorry. I know. I'm not your dad. I don't
[37:23.260 --> 37:28.540]  hunch. I do. I don't care that much. All right. So prosecutors object to war on weed is the title
[37:28.540 --> 37:33.260]  of this article. I'm looking for someone who wrote it. Who, where's the author? What's that? Mine or
[37:33.260 --> 37:37.020]  yours? Chris Wigand. I was from Mike. This is one of the Mike sent us. I'm sorry. That's cool.
[37:37.020 --> 37:41.340]  You're I'm dabbed out to show on the road, keeping the show on the road.
[37:42.060 --> 37:49.180]  Um, all right. Prosecutors object to war on weed by Chris Wigand. I probably said that wrong,
[37:49.180 --> 37:52.940]  but you know, that's how I do stuff. Whoa. Technical glitch there. It's not like I cut
[37:52.940 --> 37:57.980]  out for a second. Anyway. Uh, where was I? Chris, we get, all right. The prosecution objects. That's
[37:57.980 --> 38:03.100]  one way to put it at any rate. Two news stories from the Pacific Northwest today pose an interesting
[38:03.100 --> 38:07.500]  question. Our prosecutors beginning to get fed up with the war on weed. The two stories are
[38:07.500 --> 38:12.220]  completely unrelated. I should mention one is about a current prosecutor at the local level.
[38:12.220 --> 38:17.340]  And one is about a formal former federal prosecutor making a noteworthy endorsement.
[38:17.340 --> 38:22.060]  Neither has anything to do with the other, but both show some common sense being applied in a,
[38:22.060 --> 38:27.580]  in refreshing ways. It's too early to call it a trend, even a regional regional one,
[38:27.580 --> 38:33.660]  but it certainly is a step in the right direction at the very least. So first the local story,
[38:34.220 --> 38:42.220]  Seattle's electorate, geez, Seattle's elected prosecutor said Monday, he's dropping all tickets
[38:42.220 --> 38:47.340]  issued for the public use of marijuana through the first seven months of this year, because most of
[38:47.340 --> 38:53.020]  them were issued by a single officer who disagrees with the legal pot law in a briefing to city
[38:53.020 --> 38:59.740]  council on Monday, city attorney Pete Holmes says he is moving to dismiss approximately 100 tickets
[38:59.740 --> 39:05.900]  issued by the Seattle police department between January 1st and July 31st. His office also said
[39:05.900 --> 39:13.660]  it would be seeking a refund for 22 people who have already paid their $27 ticket. So one state
[39:13.660 --> 39:18.860]  to the South, a former federal prosecutor for Oregon has thrown her support behind a ballot
[39:18.860 --> 39:24.700]  initiative to legalize recreational marijuana for adults in the state. Chris Olson, who served as
[39:24.700 --> 39:30.060]  Oregon's chief federal prosecutor during the Clinton administration, made the news by joining
[39:30.060 --> 39:36.700]  house member Earl Blumenauer and a former Oregon Supreme court justice by publicly, publicly
[39:36.700 --> 39:41.100]  supporting the ballot measure. And here's the story. I enforce our marijuana laws, but they
[39:41.100 --> 39:46.140]  don't work, Olson said in a statement announcing her endorsement, filling our courts and jails has
[39:46.140 --> 39:52.060]  failed to reduce marijuana use and drug cartels are pocketing all the profits, she said, citing
[39:52.060 --> 39:58.140]  federal statistics that show about one in 14 Oregon arrests is for marijuana possession.
[40:00.540 --> 40:05.420]  Real quick here, you know, we're not the government here in Colorado is not bitching about
[40:05.420 --> 40:10.300]  the cartel really any much anymore running pot. Now they're starting to look at like,
[40:11.260 --> 40:15.500]  you guys, you know what I'm saying? Like the, the guys who take care of patients,
[40:15.500 --> 40:22.540]  they're like, hold on, they're not just, we don't have control over everything. So we need that.
[40:23.100 --> 40:27.980]  And that's what it's become. It's not even a crime anymore. So now they're starting to turn into,
[40:29.020 --> 40:33.660]  we're making tons of money, but how can we get just a little more each year, a little more each
[40:33.660 --> 40:38.220]  year? There's no worry of cartels anymore. The old guys around here, a lot of the old timers don't
[40:38.220 --> 40:43.260]  like to pay kind bud prices. You know what I mean? You can get, if you know the right people,
[40:43.260 --> 40:49.580]  you can get an eighth of dank weed around here for 25 bucks. Back in the day, those guys used
[40:49.580 --> 40:56.300]  to buy that Mexican brick weed for $25 a half ounce. And they love it. They only smoke a bowl
[40:56.300 --> 40:59.740]  a day, two bowls a day. So some kind bud would just kill them, you know, two hits and they'd
[40:59.740 --> 41:04.780]  just be retarded. But lately those guys are calling up like the guys I used to talk to years
[41:04.780 --> 41:09.900]  ago. They're like, Hey man, can you get any decent weed? Because they can't find any of their old
[41:09.900 --> 41:14.380]  swag connects anymore. All that shit is gone. That cartel Mexican import weed is disappearing.
[41:15.020 --> 41:21.020]  So it's not around. Hook them up with that high CBD. So we got a first story here and this is my
[41:21.020 --> 41:25.500]  interjection here. I'm not into the article right now. The first story here is about a prosecutor
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.980]  saying that he's going to drop tickets written by a cop because that cop's a dick and did this out
[41:29.980 --> 41:34.620]  of his own. You reported on this on an earlier episode. Yeah. Fuck that cop. Yeah. I'll take a
[41:34.620 --> 41:42.140]  dollar for that one. And then we have another person saying the laws don't work and they state
[41:42.140 --> 41:47.660]  that they actually, the drug cartels are profiting. So it looks like some people are starting to
[41:47.660 --> 41:51.500]  understand. Some people are starting to see the light. These are positive reasons why we want to
[41:51.500 --> 41:57.580]  legalize cannabis. So I'll get back into the article. In the first instance, this was nothing
[41:57.580 --> 42:03.660]  short of a prosecutor using his prosecutorial discretion to avoid wasting a lot of time in the
[42:03.660 --> 42:09.260]  courts. And more importantly, to reign in one police officer who was obviously on a vendetta
[42:09.260 --> 42:14.700]  against the voters for passing a law he did not personally approve of. One single police officer
[42:15.500 --> 42:21.500]  was responsible for eight out of all 10 tickets issued in Seattle for public consumption of
[42:21.500 --> 42:26.860]  marijuana during the first half of this year. The other 20% were written by the entire rest of the
[42:26.860 --> 42:32.620]  police force. To put this in another way, this officer wrote one ticket he considered this
[42:32.700 --> 42:39.740]  officer on one ticket wrote he considered the new legalization law silly. While the officer has been
[42:39.740 --> 42:45.500]  reassigned new duties, after this came to light, there are a lot of folks with cases still in the
[42:45.500 --> 42:50.940]  legal system as a result of his actions. What a dick of a cop. Cops don't realize what they're
[42:50.940 --> 42:54.380]  doing to you when they screw you up for having a little bit of weed or whatever you're doing.
[42:54.940 --> 42:59.100]  Some of them do and they love it. That shit sucks. Come on guys, if you're a cop, some cops are
[42:59.100 --> 43:03.900]  listening to the podcast. I know you are. I know you're a law enforcement officer. We want to
[43:03.900 --> 43:09.660]  educate you about how not dangerous cannabis is. It's something that... Ask us. Yeah, I mean,
[43:10.540 --> 43:14.220]  especially if it's here. Just listen to the show. Just listen to the show. You guys will learn.
[43:14.220 --> 43:17.900]  Inform yourself. Listen to me. I'm a smart dude. I'm an educated dude. I'm reading news. I'm trying
[43:17.900 --> 43:21.900]  to educate people. I'm trying to keep people safe. We're not bad people. Did you not just hear
[43:21.900 --> 43:28.220]  stoners with words right there? Yeah, that was impressive. Smokes pot, not a bad person. Right.
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.340]  Yeah. In Washington state, of course, recreational marijuana use is legal. The voters approve the
[43:33.340 --> 43:38.220]  change in state law and the prosecutor's actions quite obviously reflect the will of the people,
[43:38.220 --> 43:43.180]  but it didn't have to happen this way. Prosecutors in general are pretty much tough on crime types of
[43:43.180 --> 43:47.500]  people. And if this particular prosecutor has agreed with the cop's way of thinking,
[43:47.500 --> 43:52.220]  then all these cases would have continued to clog the legal system all the way to the bitter end,
[43:52.220 --> 43:58.380]  all $27 of it. This prosecutor, however, objected to that scenario and applied some common sense.
[43:58.380 --> 44:03.420]  He's even going the extra mile and trying to refund fines already paid. That is truly commendable.
[44:03.420 --> 44:07.100]  That is a truly commendable action. Once again, reflecting the will of the voters
[44:07.820 --> 44:12.620]  in legal reality. The second news item doesn't seem to deal with actual legal cases.
[44:12.620 --> 44:18.220]  It comes from a prosecutor who no longer works for the federal department of justice. Still,
[44:18.220 --> 44:22.860]  this is a stunning development. Federal prosecutors after all are not bound by any
[44:22.860 --> 44:27.500]  state law and therefore can apply federal law. Whether marijuana is still the most illegal of
[44:27.500 --> 44:33.820]  all drugs, aware marijuana is still the most illegal of all drugs without even having to weigh
[44:33.820 --> 44:39.180]  in on state politics. Believe it or not, there are some extremely zealous federal prosecutors
[44:39.180 --> 44:43.500]  all up and down the West coast who are fighting tooth and nail against any state legalization
[44:43.500 --> 44:49.260]  efforts in unprecedented and creative ways. Hearing even a former prosecutor bluntly refute
[44:49.260 --> 44:55.900]  the entire purpose of the federal war on weed is a welcome development indeed. The language she used
[44:55.900 --> 45:00.940]  is a pretty strong condemnation of federal laws she upheld while in office. I enforced our marijuana
[45:00.940 --> 45:05.820]  laws and they don't work. Prosecutors are practical people who deal with the real end aftermath of
[45:05.820 --> 45:12.700]  arresting marijuana users. The argument used is not a moral one. Locking up marijuana users is
[45:12.700 --> 45:17.900]  wrong or one of racial equality. Black and brown people are treated differently by the court system
[45:17.900 --> 45:22.300]  or even a political one. The public's mood has shifted. Instead, it's a view from the front
[45:22.300 --> 45:26.780]  lines of the drug war which relies on personal experience in applying federal laws and the
[45:26.780 --> 45:32.140]  relative effectiveness of carrying out this job. I enforced our marijuana laws and they don't work.
[45:33.820 --> 45:38.700]  So this person instead of just playing by the book basically saying had weed go to jail,
[45:38.700 --> 45:43.340]  had weed go to jail, had a lot of weed go to prison. They're actually looking at what they're
[45:43.340 --> 45:47.660]  doing to people like I was saying. They're saying you had some weed, you're a human, let's quit
[45:47.660 --> 45:51.900]  smoking weed, here's a fine, get your shit together, don't go to prison forever, don't go get butt raped.
[45:52.460 --> 45:57.500]  They're taking some compassion into this finally. They're just starting to hear the other
[45:57.500 --> 46:04.140]  side of the story and that's all you nine times out of ten you got to do. You know when you're
[46:04.140 --> 46:08.380]  going to court and standing in front of the judge, everybody just kind of pushes you behind your
[46:08.380 --> 46:14.940]  lawyer or public pretender, you know, sitting there and that's the they say you have your day
[46:14.940 --> 46:19.180]  but a lot of times they just ask you if you understand and it's a yes or no question is all
[46:19.180 --> 46:25.660]  you really get. So it's good that they're finally starting to be like what did you have, you know.
[46:25.660 --> 46:31.340]  Yeah. All right. So of all the pro-legalization arguments, this could perhaps be the strongest one.
[46:31.340 --> 46:35.660]  The laws don't work. They don't have the intended effect. The feds have been fighting the war on
[46:35.660 --> 46:43.020]  weed for almost a century now with precious little to show for it. Yeah, definitely. And in fact,
[46:43.020 --> 46:49.020]  they have severe unintended consequences. Drug cartels are pocketing all of the profits.
[46:49.020 --> 46:54.540]  Therefore, mindlessly continuing on the same course is nothing short of madness. I think that's
[46:54.540 --> 46:59.340]  what they call insanity. Chris Olson is not the first law enforcement officer to have this revelation
[46:59.340 --> 47:04.540]  and begin publicly trying to change the situation. An entire organization already exists. Law
[47:04.540 --> 47:09.260]  enforcement against prohibition or LEAP for members of the law enforcement community past
[47:09.260 --> 47:14.780]  and present to advocate the marijuana legal reform. Many members are former cops who have
[47:14.780 --> 47:19.580]  firsthand who saw firsthand how pointless the entire war on weed truly was throughout their
[47:19.580 --> 47:24.620]  careers. Now free to the prospect of ending their career over a public statement, many are speaking
[47:24.620 --> 47:30.060]  out on the subject. Their message is a simple one. Prohibition didn't work and prohibition of marijuana
[47:30.060 --> 47:38.140]  isn't working either. Chris Olson is to be commended for raising her own prosecutorial
[47:38.140 --> 47:42.300]  objection and for knowing her public support behind a ballot measure in the state where she
[47:42.300 --> 47:47.260]  used to uphold the law. The personal connection to the state ballot measure might convince a few
[47:47.260 --> 47:53.820]  voters, even tough on crime types. Sorry, let me move this page. It's all scrolling on its own.
[47:53.820 --> 47:59.340]  There we go. Where were we? All the rest of the arguments aside, the law needs changing because
[47:59.340 --> 48:04.140]  it doesn't work. It does nothing short of waste time for the entire judicial system for something
[48:04.140 --> 48:09.340]  which shouldn't even be illegal in the first place. The Oregon ballot measure race may be close.
[48:09.340 --> 48:13.500]  The year Washington and Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, Oregon had a similar
[48:13.500 --> 48:18.540]  but badly written initiative on its ballot. It failed. This time around the effort is a lot more
[48:18.540 --> 48:24.700]  serious, but reliable polling on the subject is notoriously hard to do. So the vote might be very
[48:24.700 --> 48:30.620]  close in November. Guys, if you're in Oregon when this comes up, go vote to legalize cannabis.
[48:31.340 --> 48:36.220]  So pro-legalization groups will be very closely watching the vote this year in Oregon and in
[48:36.220 --> 48:42.300]  Alaska and Washington, DC. So assumably, assumably, sorry, my throat's burning out. I'm trying to go
[48:42.300 --> 48:49.020]  fast. Assumably, they'll also be closely watching the impact of Olson's simple, the laws don't work
[48:49.020 --> 48:54.140]  message. Olson's message is a powerful one because it could reach voters not generally open to other
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.740]  pro-legalization arguments. If you're a law and order type of voter, a formal former federal
[48:59.740 --> 49:04.380]  prosecutor's opinion should carry some weight. In other words, perhaps more prosecutors, both
[49:04.380 --> 49:09.420]  state and federal, both current and former can be enlisted in this movement. As I said, it is far
[49:09.420 --> 49:14.860]  too early to call this any sort of trend, but it certainly is a development worth taking note of.
[49:14.860 --> 49:20.540]  To end on the legal theme we began on, perhaps the voters will sustain these prosecutors objections.
[49:21.020 --> 49:29.180]  Man. You can follow Chris on Twitter. This was written by Chris Wiegant. It's at Chris
[49:29.180 --> 49:34.460]  Wiegant, W-E-I-G-A-N-T. A very well-written article. Make sure you follow him on Twitter.
[49:35.020 --> 49:40.940]  Thanks for letting me read your stuff. Man, people are catching on, it looks like.
[49:40.940 --> 49:49.100]  It, for sure. It's glad to see the people are just open for debate, at least.
[49:49.100 --> 49:52.700]  Yeah. And maybe like they said, maybe now that...
[49:54.700 --> 49:56.060]  The state hasn't melted.
[49:56.060 --> 50:00.940]  The older people don't want to hear from you and me that weed is harmless, that cannabis is
[50:00.940 --> 50:05.020]  helpful, that medical marijuana will help you. People don't want to hear that. But if you're
[50:06.060 --> 50:11.020]  a former from the Fed, then they have to listen to you because you're obviously not full of shit.
[50:12.300 --> 50:16.380]  Well, at least they should trust you because you're the one been feeding them the shit for
[50:16.380 --> 50:19.340]  the past however many years. So...
[50:20.380 --> 50:23.660]  Well, now what do we believe? Do we believe all the bullshit that you told us for many,
[50:23.660 --> 50:25.500]  many years? Or do we believe your new bullshit?
[50:26.940 --> 50:31.820]  Soon as we start believing the new bullshit from the person that used to be like ex-military,
[50:31.820 --> 50:35.820]  then we're crazy right along with them. You know what I'm saying? They just label us as that.
[50:35.820 --> 50:39.740]  They do. I don't know if you guys heard the air quotations, but they were there.
[50:40.460 --> 50:47.820]  So whatever. Man, that's just crazy. I hope Oregon gets it going because they...
[50:48.780 --> 50:55.500]  You guys got so much talent. I mean, I've only seen from social media and stuff like that,
[50:55.500 --> 51:02.300]  but I've seen people up that way. You're right between two meccas. You can't go wrong.
[51:02.940 --> 51:10.460]  You'll be the perfect blend. And you got many respectable people up there already
[51:10.460 --> 51:15.660]  under medical coma. I think coma may have moved.
[51:15.660 --> 51:20.780]  Wow. But yeah, this is for rec weed also. So let's get the rec weed going on.
[51:20.780 --> 51:25.500]  It doesn't always have to be medical. All right. Let's wrap up this show, bro. We've
[51:25.500 --> 51:29.260]  been going for a long time. It sounds like we're going to go get some dank food over at the Mate
[51:29.260 --> 51:39.260]  Factor. All right. I wrote down some shout outs and people we want to follow. Make sure you follow,

[53:36.340 --> 53:44.500]  It is the only way, so don't you abuse it, yeah, it's resources a must
[53:46.340 --> 53:51.060]  Just build a split and pass it to us, yeah
[53:52.660 --> 53:59.060]  Sweet sensamilia, burn it in the night
