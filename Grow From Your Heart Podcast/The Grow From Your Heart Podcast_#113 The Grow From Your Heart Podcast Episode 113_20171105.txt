[00:17.340 --> 00:19.860]  Yeah, happy new year, cannabis community.
[00:19.860 --> 00:21.660]  It's time for episode number 113
[00:21.660 --> 00:23.420]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.420 --> 00:27.420]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.420 --> 00:28.460]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.460 --> 00:29.540]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.540 --> 00:31.740]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.740 --> 00:32.980]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:32.980 --> 00:34.300]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.300 --> 00:36.100]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.100 --> 00:38.660]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.660 --> 00:40.380]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.380 --> 00:42.260]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.260 --> 00:44.420]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.420 --> 00:46.020]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:46.020 --> 00:48.100]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:48.100 --> 00:51.980]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.700 --> 00:54.860]  Yeah, happy new year, everybody.
[00:54.860 --> 00:56.580]  I hope you guys had a great new year.
[00:56.580 --> 00:58.460]  Hope you've made some new year's goals.
[00:58.460 --> 01:00.020]  If you haven't made some goals for the new year,
[01:00.020 --> 01:01.540]  you should grab a pen and a paper
[01:01.540 --> 01:02.820]  and you should just write down a few things
[01:02.820 --> 01:05.540]  that you wanna accomplish in 2016.
[01:05.540 --> 01:07.060]  And when you get that feeling of accomplishment,
[01:07.060 --> 01:08.460]  you're gonna wanna accomplish bigger goals.
[01:08.460 --> 01:11.140]  So just write down some goals and get that shit done, guys.
[01:11.140 --> 01:13.940]  And also, if you had some bullshit in 2015,
[01:13.940 --> 01:15.940]  now is the time to shake it off and leave it all behind.
[01:16.780 --> 01:18.780]  If you haven't forgotten about the bullshit of 2015,
[01:18.780 --> 01:21.100]  it's time to take a big old fat dab,
[01:21.100 --> 01:23.500]  smoke a big old fat joint, smoke a fat blunt,
[01:23.500 --> 01:25.500]  hit the vaporizer, however you do it.
[01:25.500 --> 01:26.780]  I'm gonna take a big old fat dab
[01:26.780 --> 01:30.220]  and we're gonna blow out all the bullshit of 2015.
[01:30.220 --> 01:32.220]  We're gonna start fresh here in 2016.
[01:32.220 --> 01:36.020]  So we're gonna do that out of my brand new Hitman short stack.
[01:36.020 --> 01:37.860]  Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[01:37.860 --> 01:38.700]  You guys know me.
[01:38.700 --> 01:40.580]  When I buy a rig, I like to buy an American rig,
[01:40.580 --> 01:42.340]  something made in America by an American.
[01:42.340 --> 01:44.020]  So I buy Hitman glass.
[01:44.020 --> 01:45.540]  Hitman glass is made by dabbers.
[01:46.140 --> 01:47.620]  These kids dab as hard as you and I do.
[01:47.620 --> 01:49.660]  Hitman Dougie is a dab enthusiast.
[01:49.660 --> 01:51.500]  He is a supporter of the hash movement.
[01:51.500 --> 01:53.660]  He throws a festival every summer in California
[01:53.660 --> 01:55.020]  called the Chalice Festival.
[01:55.020 --> 01:56.060]  Make sure you check that out.
[01:56.060 --> 01:59.200]  You guys, I am gonna hit my brand new Hitman short stack.
[01:59.200 --> 02:01.460]  I don't think there are words to describe this rig
[02:01.460 --> 02:03.220]  other than fucking amazing.
[02:03.220 --> 02:04.380]  So I've got the enail hooked up.
[02:04.380 --> 02:06.420]  I've got a big old glob of cactus cooler
[02:06.420 --> 02:07.980]  from Turpex on the dabber.
[02:07.980 --> 02:10.340]  You guys take a dab with me and then we will get on the show.
[02:10.340 --> 02:13.860]  Let's inhale some positivity and love and freshness.
[02:13.860 --> 02:14.740]  And then when we exhale,
[02:14.740 --> 02:17.620]  we're gonna exhale all the bullshit from 2015.
[02:17.620 --> 02:19.620]  Let's take this dab together, you guys.
[02:30.610 --> 02:31.890]  Yeah, all right.
[02:31.890 --> 02:33.490]  Well, that was, all right.
[02:33.490 --> 02:34.570]  Well, I'm heavily medicated.
[02:34.570 --> 02:36.210]  Now this will be a fun podcast.
[02:36.210 --> 02:37.510]  So shout out to the Hitman glass crew.

[02:46.290 --> 02:48.010]  Glass made in America by Americans,
[02:48.010 --> 02:51.650]  made by guys who dab just as hard as you.
[02:51.650 --> 02:53.010]  All right, I'm gonna turn down this music.
[02:53.010 --> 02:54.050]  We'll get on with the show.
[02:54.410 --> 02:55.690]  You guys, I also wanna make a huge announcement.
[02:55.690 --> 02:58.950]  Green and Healthy Wellness is now open for business.
[02:58.950 --> 03:00.770]  We are a medical marijuana facility
[03:00.770 --> 03:02.350]  in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[03:02.350 --> 03:05.070]  We are at 430 West Colorado Avenue.
[03:05.070 --> 03:06.610]  If you have a medical marijuana card,
[03:06.610 --> 03:09.970]  we would love to see you drop by, pick up some Turpex,
[03:09.970 --> 03:12.970]  pick up some apothecana, pick up some top shelf flowers.
[03:12.970 --> 03:14.810]  We'd love to see you in there.
[03:14.810 --> 03:17.930]  Big shout out to Britt, Carly, Haley,
[03:17.930 --> 03:19.770]  Buzzy and especially Hunt.
[03:19.770 --> 03:20.890]  The entire crew, a big shout out
[03:20.890 --> 03:22.150]  for getting that place going.
[03:22.150 --> 03:23.290]  I'm proud of you guys.
[03:23.330 --> 03:25.130]  Drop in, give us a visit.
[03:25.130 --> 03:28.170]  What else do we have for business?
[03:28.170 --> 03:29.050]  The sticker packs.
[03:29.050 --> 03:32.130]  Remember a few episodes ago, we did a hashtag
[03:32.130 --> 03:34.330]  and everybody who messaged us on Twitter
[03:34.330 --> 03:37.330]  and used that hashtag, they are going to get a sticker pack.
[03:37.330 --> 03:39.610]  A couple of nights ago, Mike and I sat here
[03:39.610 --> 03:42.370]  and addressed envelopes and I will be stuffing stickers
[03:42.370 --> 03:45.010]  into those envelopes and they will go out Monday morning.
[03:45.010 --> 03:46.570]  So when this podcast drops,
[03:46.570 --> 03:49.490]  those stickers will be in the mail Monday, the same day.
[03:49.490 --> 03:50.330]  So by the time you hear this,
[03:50.330 --> 03:52.130]  the stickers are on the way to you.
[03:52.130 --> 03:53.050]  I've only got, let's see,
[03:53.050 --> 03:54.410]  how many do I have here that are addressed?
[03:54.410 --> 03:56.270]  I've got one, I've got two
[03:56.270 --> 03:57.550]  and the third person already got there.
[03:57.550 --> 03:58.530]  So I've only got two.
[03:58.530 --> 04:00.650]  So if you were involved in that
[04:00.650 --> 04:02.930]  and you need to send me your address,
[04:02.930 --> 04:06.310]  send me your address to growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[04:06.310 --> 04:09.010]  and remind me that you deserve stickers
[04:09.010 --> 04:12.690]  from the hashtag I like it when you ramble sticker giveaway.
[04:12.690 --> 04:14.610]  Remind me, I'll get you your stuff.
[04:14.610 --> 04:16.330]  What else do we got in?
[04:16.330 --> 04:18.650]  I need to give a big shout out to my buddy Frosty.
[04:18.650 --> 04:19.970]  I bumped into my friend Frosty
[04:19.970 --> 04:22.370]  at the Canada Canyon Dab Club the other day.
[04:22.370 --> 04:25.570]  Frosty, I smoked that Kush bud that you gave me.
[04:25.570 --> 04:26.610]  Shit, dude, I was high.
[04:26.610 --> 04:28.070]  That was awesome, thank you.
[04:28.070 --> 04:29.210]  I smoked that this morning.
[04:29.210 --> 04:30.290]  It was the first thing I smoked.
[04:30.290 --> 04:31.410]  It made my eyes a little droopy.
[04:31.410 --> 04:33.530]  It made me want to be nice and lazy for the day.
[04:33.530 --> 04:35.410]  Good weed, bro, I appreciate it.
[04:35.410 --> 04:36.690]  It's always wonderful to receive
[04:36.690 --> 04:38.650]  the gift of cannabis from friends.
[04:38.650 --> 04:40.530]  It's super great when your friends tell you
[04:40.530 --> 04:42.510]  that they listened to your podcast
[04:42.510 --> 04:44.910]  and learned how to improve their cannabis
[04:44.910 --> 04:45.810]  from listening to the show
[04:45.810 --> 04:47.890]  and then they give you buds that they grew.
[04:47.890 --> 04:49.330]  So shout out to Frosty.
[04:49.690 --> 04:50.530]  That's super good weed, dude.
[04:50.530 --> 04:51.350]  I really appreciate it.
[04:51.350 --> 04:52.730]  You did a good job.
[04:52.730 --> 04:56.130]  Well flushed, well cured, and superbly trimmed.
[04:56.130 --> 04:57.590]  I like your work.
[04:57.590 --> 04:58.450]  Man, I gotta give a shout out
[04:58.450 --> 04:59.810]  to everybody at the Canada Canyon.
[04:59.810 --> 05:01.830]  I dropped into the Canada Canyon
[05:01.830 --> 05:04.690]  and everybody there is super kind, you guys.
[05:04.690 --> 05:05.970]  When I walk in, everybody's like,
[05:05.970 --> 05:07.930]  dab this, dab this, try this.
[05:07.930 --> 05:09.250]  I tried some live resin.
[05:09.250 --> 05:11.470]  I tried some butter, tried some shatter.
[05:11.470 --> 05:12.610]  Smoked a little bit of everything.
[05:12.610 --> 05:15.150]  I had some solventless, had some full melt,
[05:15.150 --> 05:16.810]  had a little bit of everything the last time I was there.
[05:16.810 --> 05:19.410]  I really appreciate the way they treat me there.
[05:19.410 --> 05:21.570]  And shout out to all my friends at the Canada Canyon.
[05:21.570 --> 05:22.530]  Shout out to Camille.
[05:22.530 --> 05:24.490]  Shout out to everybody over there.
[05:24.490 --> 05:26.050]  I'll be doing an episode from there really soon
[05:26.050 --> 05:27.730]  that features our friend Foxtrax.
[05:27.730 --> 05:30.430]  So keep your ears open for that one.
[05:31.290 --> 05:32.850]  All right, guys, so let's get to the point of the show.
[05:32.850 --> 05:35.450]  I've been telling you that I was going to make a checklist
[05:35.450 --> 05:38.110]  of things that you should be taking care of in your garden.
[05:38.110 --> 05:39.530]  So I did that for you.
[05:39.530 --> 05:41.650]  I've got a list of things you should do daily,
[05:41.650 --> 05:45.530]  weekly, monthly, things you should do after each harvest,
[05:45.530 --> 05:47.490]  and also things that you should do yearly.
[05:47.490 --> 05:49.370]  There are a couple of things on that list.
[05:49.370 --> 05:51.850]  So I think I'm going to take a dab and a drink
[05:51.850 --> 05:54.050]  while you guys listen to a couple of seconds of reggae music
[05:54.050 --> 05:54.970]  and I will be right back
[05:54.970 --> 05:56.770]  and we will get into this checklist.

[07:23.040 --> 07:32.040]  I was listening to a podcast today, and the cohost was just coughing into the microphone and I really wanted to turn off the damn show so I apologize for coughing into the mic.
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.040]  Anyway, this checklist, here we go. This is stuff that I feel you should be doing everyday.
[07:37.040 --> 07:41.040]  Some of this stuff will vary. If you've got a hydro garden, some of this stuff will be different.
[07:41.040 --> 07:43.040]  If you've got a soil garden, some of this stuff will be different.
[07:43.040 --> 07:49.040]  Based on the size of your garden, some of this stuff will have to be done over a course of a couple of days.
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.980]  days. Some of this stuff will have to be if you've got a little garden, this stuff is
[07:53.980 --> 08:00.800]  just things that will take you two seconds. So here is what I've got for your daily checklist.
[08:00.800 --> 08:06.520]  Daily visually check each plant for bugs, molds or signs of deficiencies or over fertilization
[08:06.520 --> 08:12.100]  and correct if necessary. You got to get in there. I walk in and I just pick a random
[08:12.100 --> 08:16.340]  plant and I just pull a random leaf off of a random plant and I flip it upside down and
[08:16.340 --> 08:20.540]  I look at it and I make sure there's no bugs. I feel the leaf. I can tell by feeling the
[08:20.540 --> 08:24.540]  leaf how healthy the plant is. I can kind of rub on the leaf and tell. I like to pull
[08:24.540 --> 08:28.340]  a leaf off, look for bugs, look for molds, look around the room, see if any of the leaves
[08:28.340 --> 08:33.020]  are yellow or crispy or crunchy or if anything's happening. If you've got anything weird going
[08:33.020 --> 08:38.980]  in there, work on correcting it. Something I should add, anything that can be done today,
[08:38.980 --> 08:43.160]  do it today. Don't wait until tomorrow. You've got plenty of shit to do tomorrow. Whatever
[08:43.160 --> 08:46.880]  you can do today, do it or you just keep adding shit up for tomorrow and then tomorrow
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.360]  never comes and then one of these days you're going to have a big ass list of shit that
[08:50.360 --> 08:54.480]  you never did and you're going to find problems in your grow and you're going to know why.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.640]  It's because you didn't do that list of shit that you should have been keeping up on. So
[08:57.640 --> 09:01.120]  try to stay on top of your chores, you guys. That's what I'm saying. So check your plants
[09:01.120 --> 09:04.000]  every day. You should be touching every single plant. You should be putting your eyes on
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.780]  every single plant. Get in there and love them. So the second thing on my list here,
[09:07.780 --> 09:12.160]  check to see if the plants need water. You can check visually. I can see if the plants
[09:12.160 --> 09:14.960]  look droopy at all, if they're starting to lean over, if the leaves are kind of hanging
[09:14.960 --> 09:21.040]  down, they need water or lift up the pot and check the weight. The standard way to do this
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.040]  is think about it this way. Water your plant, water it until it's full, freshly watered.
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.640]  Pick it up and see how much it weighs. That's its full weight. When it weighs half of that,
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.760]  it's ready to be watered again. You need to pour in water and get it wet again. So second
[09:34.760 --> 09:40.440]  thing, check to see if the plants need water. The third thing I would do every single day,
[09:40.440 --> 09:44.840]  is pull any dead leaves and put them in a trash bag or a trash can that gets removed
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.840]  from the garden area. I don't like to leave my trash bag or my trash can in the garden.
[09:49.840 --> 09:55.080]  That doesn't make sense to me. I want to get that out of there. One of the reasons being,
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.200]  I apologize for all the coughing and clearing over the throat. That'll end here pretty soon.
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.520]  I took a couple of fat dabs. The reason I like to get yellowing leaves out of the room
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.600]  is bugs are attracted to yellow leaves. Bugs see yellow leaves as a perfect opportunity.
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.600]  Outer layer of the leaf has been softened and they can bite in and get to the juicy
[10:12.600 --> 10:16.800]  insides of the leaves a little more easily. Bugs know that. So they're attracted to yellow
[10:16.800 --> 10:21.200]  leaves. That's why your sticky traps are yellow. So get all the yellow leaves out of there,
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.700]  put them in a trash can, put them in a trash bag and get them out of the room because those
[10:25.700 --> 10:30.120]  are going to attract bugs. So get that shit away from there. The next thing I would recommend,
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.480]  check the clones in the domes for moisture. Check the humidity levels in your clones and
[10:36.440 --> 10:41.320]  check for roots. If you've got roots, transplant them. If they're going into the next size rock
[10:41.320 --> 10:44.840]  well, put them into there. If they're going into cups with soil, throw them into there. If they've
[10:44.840 --> 10:49.040]  got roots, do whatever you need to do. If they need moisture or humidity, adjust that shit. Get
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.480]  in there and fix it. You can fix the clone domes really easily. So the next thing to do, check the
[10:53.480 --> 11:00.280]  temps and the humidity of the room and adjust that if necessary. You guys try to aim for 40 to 60%
[11:00.280 --> 11:05.080]  humidity during your bloom phase. And then during the veg phase, you can be around 60 to 70%
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.440]  humidity. I wouldn't go any higher than 70% humidity and try to have some airflow along with
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.520]  that or you will get some issues. Try to keep the daytime temperature around 70 to 77 degrees. I
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.880]  really like 74 degrees. Plants really like 74. Some of the sativas like to get up to 77 during
[11:21.880 --> 11:28.200]  the day cycle. During the night cycle, try to stay within 10 degrees of what your day cycle is. So if
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.160]  during the day you're getting 77, at night you want to be at 67 or a little higher. Don't go
[11:33.160 --> 11:39.720]  more than 10 degrees swing from day to night. So during the day, 70 to 77. During the night, 60 to
[11:39.720 --> 11:45.080]  65 degrees during your night cycle is what I try to aim for. Another thing that you need to do that
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.720]  a lot of people forget to do and I can tell by your Instagram photos, sweep the damn floor. All
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.520]  you got to do is get a broom and a dustpan and a bucket and sweep the floor, scoop up that shit
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.360]  that you just swept up into a dustpan, dump it into the bucket, get it out of there and put it
[11:58.360 --> 12:03.800]  into a trash can and get it out of the house. All that shit on the floor, first of all, looks terrible.
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.240]  Why do you want that shit on your floor in your grow room? It looks like shit. Get the leaves off there,
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.520]  get the dirt off there, get that, I can't think of what that shit's called right now,
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.600]  that white stuff that sucks to step on, the perlite, get the perlite up off the floor.
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.320]  Just sweep up you guys. It's not that hard. Every leaf on the floor, every little piece of debris,
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.600]  that's a good spot for a bug to hide. If you've got a problem with whiteflies, fungus gnats, spider
[12:26.600 --> 12:32.840]  mites, aphids, thrips, that's another spot for a bug to hide. One little tiny bug can hide under a
[12:32.840 --> 12:38.600]  leaf and lay so many eggs. Don't give them the opportunity, you guys. Fight the battle at your
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.480]  advantage. Don't give these bugs a place to go. So sweep the floor. The next thing I would do,
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.440]  check any equipment. Check your hydro pumps, check the EZ-Cloner pumps, check your dehumidifiers.
[12:48.440 --> 12:52.360]  If you're running hydro, check your mix pump in your reservoir. I know a lot of guys have a big
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.440]  res filled with nutrients. You just put a pump in there to shoot the nutrients around. Check that
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.920]  pump, make sure it hasn't gotten clogged up. Those pumps have little filters on them. They like to get
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.800]  gunky. If you're using any kind of feed system, check that thing. Make sure your sprinklers haven't
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.960]  gotten clogged up. If you've got an EZ-Cloner, check the water level in that as well and refill
[13:11.960 --> 13:18.120]  it and adjust the pH. So the next thing you should do, check the pH and PPM levels if you're running
[13:18.120 --> 13:24.520]  any hydro. If you've got a flood and drain kit, if you're doing buckets or whatever, check your pH.
[13:24.520 --> 13:30.040]  Also check your PPM. You need to adjust your pH. You need to adjust your PPMs almost every day.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.400]  I've seen large hydro gardens need to be topped off every day, if not twice a day, because of
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.440]  water evaporation and plant productivity. And every time that water evaporates and you add more water,
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.560]  you've got to adjust the pH. So check that shit out all the time, every day if you can, twice a day
[13:45.560 --> 13:49.240]  if you can on that if you're running hydro. The hydro guys may have a little bit more work to do
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.560]  than us soil guys, but we've got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with. So the work will kind of math
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.360]  out I guess. I'm not sure. I haven't run a real hydro garden myself, so I can't speak correctly on
[13:58.360 --> 14:01.560]  that. But it seems like you have a lot of cleaning and a lot of maintenance to do on a hydro grow.
[14:02.440 --> 14:06.680]  So what's next? Prune and train the plants and shape them the way you want them for your
[14:06.680 --> 14:11.000]  grow space. That's something you can be working on every single day. Keep in mind how you want those
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.800]  plants to be shaped, get the architecture correct so that you have sturdy plants, try to use up as
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.520]  much canopy space as you can with each plant. So prune and train your plants. Take off all the
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.760]  shitty leaves, take off any little sucker leaves that are happening, just get rid of that crap,
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.400]  make the plants healthy. All right, excuse me. So the next step, lollipop any small crap while
[14:31.400 --> 14:34.360]  you're in flower. All those little tiny buds that are happening on the bottom, just
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.080]  crap cut that crap off. You can lollipop all the way up through week four. I've done it up into
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.080]  week five. Once you get the hang of it, you can really get carried away. You'll know what to cut
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.640]  off, you'll know what to leave. So when you're new at it, only do it for the first couple of weeks I
[14:47.640 --> 14:50.680]  guess until you get the hang of it. Then once you've gotten a few crops under your belt that
[14:50.680 --> 14:54.040]  you've lollipopped, you'll be able to do it up into week four or five without pissing the plants
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.120]  off. I've done it too late and caused hermaphrodites. That's why I warn you to go light and then learn
[14:58.120 --> 15:03.480]  how to do it. So lollipop stuff, take off all that small crap in flower, pull off any funky leaves
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.680]  while you're there. So the next thing that you can do every single day you guys, take notes on
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.680]  everything you do. Everything you do, just write down what you do. I run a large grow for green and
[15:14.680 --> 15:20.200]  healthy wellness. Basically, the owner of green and healthy wellness has put me in charge of the
[15:20.200 --> 15:26.040]  grow. What I say goes. He doesn't ask me any questions as long as at the end of the harvest,
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.760]  there's our goal weight of quality flower. Nobody's going to fuck with me and I'm going to reach that
[15:30.760 --> 15:37.160]  goal. But the OCD person in me, the person that likes to be accountable, I make notes of everything
[15:37.160 --> 15:42.040]  I do all day, every day. If I open up my phone, we could read exactly what I did. Not exactly
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.520]  probably, but I mean pretty close to every step I did today from walking in and checking the clones,
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.400]  walking the rows and checking each plant, fixing the sprinklers. I write down what I do every day
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.400]  just to keep accountability and to keep myself reminded of what's been done so that if something
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.400]  goes wrong, I can look back on that and go, oh look, it was right here when I mixed this stupid
[15:59.400 --> 16:06.440]  shit together, I messed up. Also, you guys, a good reason to take notes. This industry is expanding
[16:06.440 --> 16:10.200]  rapidly and we're going to have marijuana available in every state before too long.
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.640]  When states start legalizing cannabis and it's time to hire professional growers, you guys that
[16:15.640 --> 16:21.960]  took good notes of all your grows, you guys are going to have a portfolio, basically an application
[16:21.960 --> 16:26.840]  or a resume right there on paper. You can say, look, I took notes. That shows that you're organized,
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.520]  it shows that you're accountable, it shows that you're planning, it shows that you're thinking,
[16:30.520 --> 16:34.440]  it shows that you're serious. All the other guys are going to be able to say, well, I grew this
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.840]  much weed in my mom's basement and they're not going to have any pictures or any notes or anything
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.080]  like that. So you guys are taking notes, you're going to have the advantage there. So take notes
[16:43.080 --> 16:46.840]  on everything you do. I talk about that a lot, but it's something that I think is really serious in
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.480]  a cannabis grow. What if you do something different this time and it comes out perfect? You're going
[16:51.480 --> 16:55.160]  to want to know what you did. The only way your dumb high ass is going to remember is if you wrote
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.000]  it down because you're smoking too much good weed because you're growing too much good weed. So
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.680]  write shit down. And that is my weekly or my daily to do checklist. I'm now going to move on to
[17:04.680 --> 17:08.840]  weekly. So this is stuff that you should be handling once a week. I like to pick Mondays
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.160]  and just kick Monday's ass. I get all the chores done on Monday. And then through the rest of the
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.080]  week, you can just focus on the plants and keeping everything clean and doing all that stuff. So
[17:17.080 --> 17:21.960]  every Monday, this is what I would do. I would start each week with a well-planned feed in each
[17:21.960 --> 17:27.800]  room. If you've got a clone area, if they've got water in trays or in a cloner, dump that water out,
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.360]  put fresh water in there, fresh nutrients, whatever you're using. If you're using A and B in the
[17:32.360 --> 17:37.560]  cloner or if you're using Rapid Start or if you're using Clonex, whatever, put fresh solution in your
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.280]  cloner, get it going fresh on Monday or whatever day you choose to start. But once a week, clean
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.120]  that sucker out and get it going fresh. Also water all of your veg plants, feed your veg plants with a
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.840]  strong nutrient solution on Monday. If they're little babies, maybe just some A and B. If they're
[17:52.840 --> 17:55.960]  getting a little bigger, maybe throw a little liquid karma in there. If they're getting even
[17:55.960 --> 18:00.040]  bigger, maybe they want some potassium silicates and maybe some cow mag in there. You should
[18:00.040 --> 18:05.000]  definitely be feeding your veg plants a little bit of root inoculate also. Get those roots going.
[18:05.640 --> 18:11.800]  Also feed your flowering plants a well-planned feed each week. If it's time to flush, you need
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.120]  to start flushing. That's another good reason to take notes. Then you know when to flush.
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.960]  If you guys need help planning your feeding, I did an episode all about feeding your flowering plants.
[18:21.960 --> 18:27.960]  Episode number 69 will give you a weekly schedule of what to feed your
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.640]  plants while they're in flowers. If you want to check that out, that may be useful for you.
[18:31.640 --> 18:37.800]  So every week feed your plants a well-planned feed. The next thing I would do every week is
[18:37.800 --> 18:43.320]  dust all of the fans. Those fans get dirty. Just dust the backs of them off. If you want to
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.640]  take off the screen and clean the blades every week, that would be super cool of you. Your room
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.120]  would appreciate it. All of that dust is going to end up in your dabs if you don't clean the fan.
[18:52.120 --> 18:57.000]  Think of it that way. The next thing I would do is check the timers for proper time and
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.640]  function. Be there when the lights come on a couple of times a week. I know you can't be there
[19:01.640 --> 19:05.560]  all the time when the lights come on, but if you can, try to be there. If the lights come on at
[19:05.560 --> 19:11.240]  nine o'clock, just be standing outside of the room like 857 so that when the lights click on,
[19:11.240 --> 19:15.000]  you can hear it go click and then you can open the door. You can make sure the timer is working
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.720]  and then be there again when the lights go off. So just check the timers for proper time and
[19:19.720 --> 19:25.560]  proper function. Every week I would calibrate your meters. If you've got a pH meter, you should have
[19:25.560 --> 19:30.840]  one of those calibrate it, get the four, the seven and the 10 solution and just calibrate that thing
[19:30.840 --> 19:37.240]  once a week. If you're a small time grower and you have a hydro store near you that you frequent,
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.560]  they will probably calibrate your pH meter for you. They'll be nice and do that as a courtesy.
[19:41.560 --> 19:47.880]  So calibrate your pH meter. You should also have a PPM meter. Calibrate that as frequently as you
[19:47.880 --> 19:52.040]  can at least once a week. That can make a huge difference in the quality of your flowers. If
[19:52.040 --> 19:57.000]  you're measuring something and your meter is telling you that it's at seven, but it's actually
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.680]  at five and you're adjusting to get to six, five, you're actually going to be adjusting down into
[20:00.680 --> 20:04.680]  the fours and you're really going to cause problems. So calibrate your meters. You guys,
[20:05.240 --> 20:09.640]  the next thing I would do at least once a week is check all your blowers and fans and make sure that
[20:09.640 --> 20:15.080]  they're not clogged or restricted in any way. Most of the time this you can be done visually. You can
[20:15.080 --> 20:19.240]  look around the room and see that everything is working. Maybe put your hand if you've got a big
[20:19.240 --> 20:23.880]  vortex blower, just put your hand on the outside of the vortex blower and feel it vibrate. Listen
[20:23.880 --> 20:28.120]  to it. You'll know if some shit's wrong, but just pay attention to that stuff. If it's clogged up,
[20:28.120 --> 20:32.040]  that could be a fire hazard. If it's clogged up, that is going to cause you electricity because
[20:32.040 --> 20:36.200]  that fan is spinning and you're not getting blowing out of it, but you're using electricity
[20:36.200 --> 20:39.800]  because it's spinning and trying to break free from that hair clog or whatever you've got in
[20:39.800 --> 20:44.200]  there or those leaves that are clogged in there. So just check those out. Guys, before you go
[20:44.200 --> 20:48.600]  sticking your fingers in any blowers, unplug them and give them a long time to quit spinning.
[20:48.600 --> 20:53.400]  They spin for a long time and just the, uh, the natural force of those fans spinning on their own
[20:53.400 --> 20:57.240]  weight. That's enough to put a nice cut on your finger. So watch your fucking fingers. Those
[20:57.240 --> 21:01.960]  blowers I've cut myself on a blower before. It sucks more than you would ever know. Uh, take it
[21:01.960 --> 21:05.160]  from me. There's blood, sweat and tears in my garden and that's where the blood came from.
[21:05.800 --> 21:09.960]  So the next thing you guys visually check the duct work and make sure that everything is sealed up.
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.280]  We're blowing a lot of pressure through these ducts where the ducting connects to the lights,
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.600]  where the ducting connects to the blower, where the ducting runs out of whatever room you're using.
[21:18.600 --> 21:23.240]  Just make sure that all that stuff is sealed. Also clean your air stones. If you're making
[21:23.240 --> 21:26.920]  any kind of teas or running any hydro, or if you've got cloners with air stones,
[21:26.920 --> 21:30.680]  or if you've just got water sitting there to get bubbled, to get the chlorine out,
[21:30.680 --> 21:33.880]  clean the air stones. You guys, those things get murky. Sometimes you might just want to
[21:33.880 --> 21:37.560]  throw them away and replace them. They are not that expensive. If you've got a few bucks,
[21:37.560 --> 21:42.840]  just go buy new ones. The next thing, clean your dehumidifier or humidifier filter.
[21:43.640 --> 21:48.840]  In Colorado, we probably don't even have a dehumidifier in most rooms. We use a humidifier
[21:48.840 --> 21:53.400]  in some places, but clean those filters. They get funky, that shit gets dirty. Anything that has
[21:53.400 --> 21:57.160]  water running through it frequently needs to be cleaned. It'll get gross. Just clean your shit.
[21:57.800 --> 22:02.920]  If you're running hydro, clean out your reservoir every week to 10 days and start with fresh water
[22:02.920 --> 22:07.800]  and fresh nutrients. Well, like I keep saying, water that sits around, that gets old, it gets
[22:07.800 --> 22:12.840]  gross. Shit's able to grow in there. Things can colonize in there. You don't want that. You want
[22:12.840 --> 22:17.480]  fresh stuff. If you're running easy cloners, do the same. Flush out those easy cloners. I talked
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.120]  about that a minute ago. Just dump it out, fill it with fresh water, fresh nutrients, pH it,
[22:22.120 --> 22:25.640]  and get it going all over again. Your plants will love you for it. You don't want to drink old,
[22:25.640 --> 22:29.720]  funky water, do you? You don't even leave your dog's bowl sitting there for too long without
[22:29.720 --> 22:33.320]  putting fresh water in it. Don't do that to your plants. Love your plants. They're family too.
[22:34.120 --> 22:39.560]  Something you're going to need to think about weekly, you need to dispose of your grow room
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.520]  trash carefully. When the trash man comes, you're going to want to, I would wait until the morning
[22:44.520 --> 22:48.440]  and take the trash out till when you know he's coming. Don't leave that trash sitting out there
[22:48.440 --> 22:53.720]  on the curb overnight. If it's out there on the curb, your trash is accessible to the public and
[22:53.720 --> 23:00.840]  it is legal for police officers, neighborhood kids, hungry homeless people, curious neighbors,
[23:01.560 --> 23:06.440]  whoever, private investigators, anybody can walk up to your trash and look through your shit.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.520]  Can take it if they want. Those guys stole my trash. Yeah, they can do that. They really can.
[23:10.520 --> 23:13.080]  Sorry, if you don't know what I'm talking about, I apologize. I was kind of cheesy.
[23:14.120 --> 23:18.520]  Your trash is fair game if it's out there on the curb. If you've got a whole bunch of leaves in
[23:18.520 --> 23:23.560]  there and you live in a state that is not legal to produce cannabis, that could be evidence of a
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.760]  crime right there. Be careful. Dispose of your grow room trash very carefully. If you're doing
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.840]  a large grow, take it to the dump yourself. The guys at the dump don't give a shit. Just take it
[23:32.840 --> 23:35.960]  to the dump, have it in big trash bags, just go drop it off. They don't care that you're dropping
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.600]  off weed leaves. Those guys have their own business going on. So dispose of your grow room
[23:40.600 --> 23:45.240]  trash carefully. Another thing I would recommend doing weekly, look around the grow room, look on
[23:45.240 --> 23:50.280]  the walls and the ceiling and the floors and look for any mold or moisture. If you've got
[23:50.280 --> 23:55.320]  condensation happening somewhere, figure out why that's happening. Correct it. If you've got any
[23:55.320 --> 23:59.960]  mold, I've seen blue mold form on the walls and grow rooms. I've seen little green mold form on
[23:59.960 --> 24:05.720]  the walls and grow rooms. Clean that shit up. Get rid of it. Use H2O2, use bleach, use peroxide,
[24:05.720 --> 24:10.360]  use something strong. If you want to go organic, do that. Do your thing, but clean that shit up.
[24:10.360 --> 24:15.480]  That is unhealthy for you. It's unhealthy for the plants. Figure out why it's happening and resolve
[24:15.480 --> 24:18.840]  the issue to make it not happen. Once you've cleaned it, you've got to figure out what caused
[24:18.840 --> 24:23.960]  it and stop it from happening or it'll just come back. Mold is a bitch. You can clean mold. I saw
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.960]  somebody clean mold off of a wall. They had a spot. I'm going to say it was about the size of a quarter,
[24:27.960 --> 24:32.840]  maybe a 50 cent piece. She scrubbed the mold with bleach and hot water. She called me the next day
[24:32.840 --> 24:37.240]  and she's like, come over here. I want you to see this. I walked in and that mold had formed into
[24:37.240 --> 24:43.480]  a four by four square. It just grew that much in 24 hours. It was so ridiculous. If you've got mold,
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.520]  figure out what's causing it. Clean the shit out of it. You may need to call a professional
[24:46.520 --> 24:52.360]  eventually. Don't ruin our rental home growing weed. God, I apologize for clearing the throat
[24:52.360 --> 24:55.880]  so much in this episode, but I've got a whole bunch of good dabs from the Terp station. So,
[24:55.880 --> 25:00.600]  shout out to Terpex. You can blame all the throat clearing on Jordan. That sounded grosser than it
[25:00.600 --> 25:05.320]  was meant to, but there we go. So, that's everything that you should do, in my opinion,
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.080]  stuff that you should do weekly. I'm going to move on to things that you should do monthly.
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.280]  If you're running hydro or if you have a feed system, I recommend that you clean the lines out
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.360]  some way. Who recommended it to me? I remember who said it. Shane. It was our friend Shane.
[25:20.360 --> 25:25.880]  Shane recommended that you use an air compressor to clean out the lines of your hydro system to
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.600]  blow out any clogs. So, if you've got a feed system, you've got a hydro system, clean that
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.920]  shit out. If you've got little sprinklers, clean those out. If you've got drippers, clean those out.
[25:35.960 --> 25:39.960]  You might have to hand poke them. You might have to get something pokey and just hand poke each
[25:39.960 --> 25:45.640]  little hole out by hand, but you need them clean. So, clean the shit out of those. Monthly, clean
[25:45.640 --> 25:51.400]  your air conditioner filters. That's something that needs to be done monthly. Also, test your
[25:51.400 --> 25:56.040]  smoke detectors. You should have smoke detectors in your grow rooms. Yes, you don't want that shit
[25:56.040 --> 26:01.160]  burning down. If it catches on fire, you want a heads up. So, test your smoke detectors. Replace
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.680]  the battery if necessary. That should be obvious. There's nothing like hearing beep, beep all the
[26:06.680 --> 26:10.520]  time when you're growing and the damn battery is trying to die. That's the worst sound ever. I
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.760]  don't know how anyone can live with that. Another thing you should do every month, clean the glass
[26:14.760 --> 26:20.520]  in your reflectors. This may need to be done more or less often depending on your style. If
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.080]  you're spraying in there, if you're using a foliar spray, that shit's going to probably end up a
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.240]  little bit on the reflectors unless you're careful. If you're spraying bug sprays, it's going to end
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.840]  up on the light reflectors. Clean that glass. Just clean it out. If you can, slide the glass out.
[26:34.840 --> 26:38.840]  Clean the inside. Sometimes your carbon filter blows a little bit of carbon in there. Just clean
[26:38.840 --> 26:44.040]  that stuff up. You're paying for the light to shine. It's taking electricity. The light is
[26:44.040 --> 26:48.760]  shining. Don't put a dirty lens between the light and the plants that you're trying to put the light
[26:48.760 --> 26:53.480]  on. It just makes more sense to clean it. You're paying full price no matter what you do. So,
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.560]  clean that shit. Speaking of paying full price, the next step. These may sound like no-brainers,
[26:58.120 --> 27:03.800]  but pay your electricity and water bills every month, you guys. You should be okay running a
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.160]  whole bunch of electricity and using a whole bunch of water, but the first time you miss a bill,
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.400]  they're going to come fuck with you. They're going to knock on your door. They're going to
[27:09.400 --> 27:12.920]  want their money, and that's when shit can go wrong. So, pay your bills. Don't ever try to
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.880]  ditch out on a grow bill. Don't ever steal electricity. Don't ever steal water. Just pay
[27:17.880 --> 27:21.400]  your bills. It should be a no-brainer. Most of the people that listen to this show should already be
[27:21.400 --> 27:25.880]  doing that, but don't ever steal. If you do get caught stealing electricity or water, the
[27:25.880 --> 27:32.200]  government, I think here, I was told that they're able to charge you threefold for what you use. So,
[27:32.200 --> 27:36.280]  if you use $100 in electricity and you get caught stealing it, they can charge you $300.
[27:36.920 --> 27:39.880]  Just because you stole it. So, pay up front. Don't be a dick. It's well worth it.
[27:40.760 --> 27:44.920]  All right. That's my stuff you should do monthly. I'm going to move into things that you should do
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.960]  every harvest. Every harvest, you're going to need to dispose of your sticks and leaves
[27:50.760 --> 27:53.880]  that you have left over. There's going to be a bunch of sticks and a bunch of leaves and a bunch
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.600]  of trim. Not the small trim. You want to make cash out of that, but a bunch of trim crap that you
[27:58.600 --> 28:02.600]  don't want laying around. You need to get rid of that. Like I said, don't go throwing that in the
[28:02.600 --> 28:06.200]  trash and just leaving it out there. You might want to wait for the trash guy to come. You might
[28:06.680 --> 28:10.600]  find a friend who has a construction site and get permission to throw your trash in there. Don't go
[28:10.600 --> 28:15.080]  using someone's dumpster because if you get caught doing that, that's a fine for throwing your trash
[28:15.080 --> 28:19.000]  into somebody else's shit. Then they'll want to see what you threw in there. Then this cop's
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.080]  looking at you and your big ass bag of weed leaves. Then you're trying to figure out a story.
[28:24.120 --> 28:29.160]  Figure out a clever way, a safe way, a smart way to get rid of all your sticks and leaves. Also,
[28:30.040 --> 28:36.040]  dispose of or compost or recycle all of your soil carefully. You don't want to be in the backyard
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.440]  dumping out your old pots and then your backyard ends up full of perlite and it's all white and
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.440]  speckly and the dirt doesn't look right. You can't be that guy. You have to figure out a way to
[28:44.440 --> 28:50.840]  either dispose of or recycle all of that soil that you use. Recycling soil isn't as hard as you would
[28:50.840 --> 28:55.400]  imagine. It just needs to be reamended and stirred around. Then you can definitely use that soil
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.640]  again. Figure out a way to do that. I've done a little bit of talking about that on the show.
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.520]  I'm still experimenting with it myself. Once I get good at it, I'll do a full episode on
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.480]  recycling soil. I made a little note about that. You're going to have to learn how to get rid of a
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.040]  bunch of dirt. You're going to have sticks and stuff. Get rid of that. Also, if you're running
[29:14.040 --> 29:19.880]  hydro, you're going to have rockwool cubes or you're going to have those hydroton clay pellets.
[29:19.880 --> 29:23.960]  I hate those things. You're going to have to get rid of that shit too somehow. I'm pretty sure you
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.760]  can recycle the rockwool cubes, the hydroton pellets. You can rinse them off and use them
[29:28.760 --> 29:32.840]  again. You can clean them, but eventually you got to throw those away because they get funky.
[29:33.720 --> 29:39.560]  Don't go throwing those into your trash. Make sure you get rid of those safely and smartly.
[29:39.560 --> 29:44.040]  Is smartly a word? I think so. It is now. Also, clean your pots, you guys. Every harvest,
[29:44.040 --> 29:48.760]  you should clean your pots. You should also clean your hydro trays. If you've got a 4x4
[29:48.760 --> 29:52.760]  botanic care tray or one of those 4x8 trays, you should clean those things. You're going to think
[29:52.760 --> 29:56.360]  I'm crazy, but here's how I recommend you do it. Throw it in the truck and just take them right to
[29:56.360 --> 30:00.440]  the car wash and just line the pots up against the wall and just spray the shit out of them.
[30:01.400 --> 30:05.400]  It's Colorado here. Everybody knows what you're doing. Just go spray your shit down. Nobody cares.
[30:05.400 --> 30:09.080]  The hydro trays, lean it up against the side of the truck, spray the shit out of it, throw it in
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.640]  the back of the truck, take it home. If you're in another state, that may be weird, but if cannabis
[30:13.640 --> 30:17.000]  is legal, just take them to the car wash and hose them down. Don't use any soap. Don't use the car
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.760]  washing soap. Don't wax them. Just use hot water on them with the high pressure thing and just
[30:20.760 --> 30:26.280]  spray the shit out of them. It works really well. Once you've got your pots cleaned, I recommend
[30:26.280 --> 30:31.240]  you clean the room thoroughly from top to bottom. I said earlier, use H2O2, use bleach,
[30:31.240 --> 30:35.800]  use hydrogen peroxide. There are a thousand other products I could say to use, but use something
[30:35.800 --> 30:40.920]  to get in there and sanitize the room. Don't just clean it up, sanitize it. Our good friend Mike
[30:40.920 --> 30:45.560]  helps me out when it's time to clean the room. Mike and I dress up in our little let's get clean
[30:45.560 --> 30:50.840]  suits. It's basically just our shittiest clothes we have. Put bandanas on our faces, put our hair
[30:50.840 --> 30:56.280]  in crazy hats, go down in there and just clean everything. By the time we're done, you can eat
[30:56.280 --> 30:59.960]  off the floor of my grow rooms when they're freshly started. It is so gorgeous in there.
[31:00.520 --> 31:05.240]  Since I'm talking about Mike, I want to give him a shout out. We recorded a podcast last night,
[31:05.240 --> 31:09.240]  and the recording sounded like shit. Something went wrong in the recording software, and
[31:09.240 --> 31:14.600]  everything sounded like robots. It sounded like R2-D2 and Darth Vader and B8 having conversations.
[31:15.400 --> 31:19.800]  I just deleted that. I apologize to Mike for that podcast, never making it to the air,
[31:19.800 --> 31:24.680]  but you know he'll be back. Mike, you'll be back, bro. I'm sorry that did not work, but you'll get
[31:24.680 --> 31:28.440]  over here. You got to come dab and hang out anyway. Thanks for coming. Let's get back into
[31:28.440 --> 31:33.160]  the show. Sanitize your room every harvest. That's what I was saying. Also, clean the floors and the
[31:33.160 --> 31:39.400]  walls and the ceiling, you guys. Wipe them down, scrub them down. The ceiling gets funky. You're
[31:39.400 --> 31:43.400]  in there. It's humid. You're in there spraying pesticides. You're in there spraying foliar
[31:43.400 --> 31:49.240]  sprays. That puts moisture everywhere. Then it gets humid. Water rises. The ceiling is going to
[31:49.240 --> 31:53.160]  get funkier than you're going to assume, so just scrub it. You'll think it's clean. You'll hit it
[31:53.160 --> 31:58.120]  with the rag, and you'll realize it is not clean. The walls, obviously, same thing with the foliar
[31:58.120 --> 32:01.720]  spray. Same thing with the humidity, and the floors. Everything lands on the floor. You've
[32:01.720 --> 32:05.880]  spilled nutrients there. You've been walking there. It's just filthy. Clean that shit.
[32:06.920 --> 32:11.640]  Also, inspect any seals you've made. If you've sealed up any windows or doors or anything like
[32:11.640 --> 32:16.760]  that. If you've put caulking somewhere, re-caulk it. If you've taped it, re-tape it. Also, if you've
[32:16.760 --> 32:22.520]  put up... I put up HEPA filters. If I've got a wall between two rooms, and I'm pulling air from
[32:22.520 --> 32:26.680]  one room to the other, I just go to Lowe's and buy those little square HEPA filters. I just cut
[32:26.680 --> 32:32.040]  them close to the shape I want, and just staple them to the wall. I replace those every time,
[32:32.040 --> 32:36.600]  every harvest also. I try to, because they get dusty. They get dirty, but they keep all the
[32:36.600 --> 32:41.640]  funk out of the room. Just go ahead and replace those. That's always a good idea. Just those
[32:41.640 --> 32:45.400]  little square HEPA filters. You can find them at Lowe's. If you can't find those, just use
[32:45.640 --> 32:49.560]  a... Any kind of filter will work for you. It's just better than having the hole where the air
[32:49.560 --> 32:53.720]  is moving open. You just want to put a filter over there to catch the dirt, or any bugs, or anything
[32:53.720 --> 32:58.200]  that may be trying to move around, trying to migrate from place to place. All right. Yearly,
[32:58.200 --> 33:03.720]  here are a couple of things that I think you should do every single year as a grower. Oh,
[33:03.720 --> 33:08.440]  I forgot to mention, every harvest, that little sleeve that goes around your carbon filter,
[33:08.440 --> 33:13.160]  take that off and clean it, and put it back on. Good luck not getting carbon everywhere the next
[33:13.160 --> 33:17.320]  time you turn on your carbon filter. There are tons of tricks on that. Here's what I'm talking
[33:17.320 --> 33:21.480]  about. When you use a carbon filter, every time you move it, you jar the carbon inside, and then
[33:21.480 --> 33:25.720]  you put a blower on there, and you plug in the blower to start blowing the air through the filter
[33:25.720 --> 33:29.880]  just to use it. Then all that carbon you've just stirred goes flying through all of your lights
[33:29.880 --> 33:36.360]  and into your grow room. You've got to figure out a smart way to catch that carbon. What I do
[33:36.360 --> 33:41.720]  is I blow it into a... I've got a... What is it? I know what it is. I can't think of the brand.
[33:41.720 --> 33:45.560]  It's a Crown Royal bag because the Crown Royal bag will let the air out, but it'll catch all of
[33:45.560 --> 33:50.040]  the particulate that's coming through. I just put the ducting into a Crown Royal bag and hold it,
[33:50.040 --> 33:53.720]  then plug it in, and it blows into there for a couple seconds. Then I just pull that off and
[33:53.720 --> 33:58.360]  seal it up, and I've caught all the carbon in there. That's a trick, a really weird random
[33:58.360 --> 34:02.680]  trick to keep all the carbon from blowing out when you've got a new carbon filter. Take that
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.440]  little cover off, you guys. It comes with a sleeve. Take that off, clean it. It looks like
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.360]  shit when it's all dusty anyway. You want that white and clean. Clean it up. Put some OxiClean
[34:10.360 --> 34:15.400]  in the water. Get that sucker white again. Yearly, here's where we are. Yearly, replace your carbon
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.040]  filter. The guy at the hydro shop swears to me that my carbon filters are going to last two years.
[34:20.040 --> 34:26.760]  They do not. There was a guy replacing a... What's it called? A transformer in my backyard a couple
[34:26.760 --> 34:31.800]  of weeks ago. He told me, sir, it smells like you got a skunk back here. There were no skunks back
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.360]  there. That was a little bit of Grateful Dog crossed a Space Queen, and it was stinking up
[34:36.360 --> 34:39.960]  the whole neighborhood because my carbon filter needed to be replaced. I've got a new one sitting
[34:39.960 --> 34:44.360]  there now. As soon as I rebuild the room, I'll have a fresh filter. The neighbors will quit
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.840]  smelling the candy-scented skunks. So replace your carbon filter. They only last about a year.
[34:49.640 --> 34:55.240]  Another thing that you should do every year, you guys, have your fire extinguisher checked and
[34:55.240 --> 35:00.520]  replaced or charged. They've got a little red, yellow, and green gauge on them. You want it all
[35:00.520 --> 35:04.360]  the way in the green. If it starts to get to yellow, it's not reliable anymore, and you need
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.440]  a new fire extinguisher. You either need to go get it charged or just buy a new one. They sell
[35:08.440 --> 35:12.760]  them at Lowe's. They sell them at Home Depot. They're not expensive. Hopefully, you never need
[35:12.760 --> 35:17.400]  it. I really hope you never need it, but if you do, you want it fully charged. Always have a fire
[35:17.400 --> 35:23.080]  extinguisher near your grow. I've got one. I've got a bedroom. I've got a flowering room. There's
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.240]  a fire extinguisher hanging on the outside of my flowering room. Have it on the outside. If
[35:27.240 --> 35:31.320]  something goes, if you hear that smoke alarm and they're going off, grab the fire extinguisher.
[35:31.320 --> 35:35.480]  Check the door for heat. If it's stupid hot, you have a decision to make. Do you want to open that
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.640]  door or not? Open that door. Hit that fucker with the fire extinguisher that you've already
[35:39.640 --> 35:42.840]  got in your hand. You don't want to open the door and run in there and find the fire extinguisher in
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.880]  the smoky, hot, fiery room. Have it on the outside. I prayed to Jah that you never have to
[35:47.880 --> 35:54.120]  use your fire extinguisher, but I'd rather you have it and it work. I'd rather you be safe than
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.520]  this thing fail on you. I've got another fire extinguisher right just outside the bedroom.
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.520]  That's where shit can go wrong. There are a lot of lights, a lot of electricity.
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.920]  Just want to be a responsible grower, try to be responsible. Get your fire extinguisher
[36:06.920 --> 36:13.560]  inspected and replaced once a year. I think that's all I've got for the checklist, you guys.
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.440]  I really want to thank all my friends on Facebook. I posted to Facebook asking for some updates and a
[36:18.440 --> 36:21.960]  lot of people contributed. So many of you that I'm not even going to try to list everybody.
[36:21.960 --> 36:26.440]  Shout out to my Facebook community that helped out. I truly appreciate that. There's some things
[36:26.440 --> 36:31.240]  I did leave out. I understand that things got left out here. You'll need to work on a pest
[36:31.240 --> 36:35.640]  management system. You'll need to integrate that into this checklist somehow. If you don't see any
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.600]  issues, you can simply spray once a week with an organic application, whatever you want to use.
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.280]  I use Azimax if there's no problems. Since I travel from so many gardens, I hit my plants
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.280]  once a week with Azimax when they're in veg just to make sure that I don't bring anything home from
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.840]  all the other gardens I play in. If you see any issues in your garden, you may need to increase
[36:54.840 --> 37:00.280]  the frequency and the potency of whatever you're spraying. Maybe change the active ingredient to
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.200]  something a little bit stronger. Hopefully you don't get any pests if you're doing something
[37:04.200 --> 37:07.880]  preventative, but that's something you'll have to work into this regiment here as well.
[37:08.840 --> 37:13.240]  There's also going to be a point in time where you're going to need to change your light bulbs.
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.080]  We did another episode on that. Every bulb is different. Every garden is different.
[37:17.800 --> 37:24.200]  We talked about swapping out your 1000 watt HPS bulbs about every one to three harvests. I've
[37:24.200 --> 37:28.840]  heard people using them for a full year. I've heard people using them for a while. Just like I said
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.320]  earlier, when your bulbs start diminishing, your eyes won't notice it, but your plants will.
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.680]  You're still paying for all of the electricity. If you've got a 1000 watt bulb and it's like six
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.400]  months old, it's probably only putting out 60 to 70 percent of its output, but you're paying for
[37:43.400 --> 37:49.160]  100 percent of that 1000 watts to be running. Go upgrade your bulbs. It doesn't cost that much
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.360]  money. If you think about how much herb you're going to grow from a fresh bulb, the difference,
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.640]  the cost of that bulb should definitely be worth it. That's what I've got for you on a checklist of
[37:59.640 --> 38:04.520]  things that you should be doing in your garden. Don't be shy to send me things that I missed. If
[38:04.520 --> 38:08.520]  there's something you want to add to this, if there's something I did wrong, let me know. I
[38:08.520 --> 38:12.520]  want to hear from you. No matter what you've got to say, send me an email. It's growfromyourheart
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.960]  at hotmail.com. You can find me on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. You can hit me up on Facebook.
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.840]  It's simply Grow From Your Heart Podcast. If you know my personal Facebook, you can find me there.
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.080]  If you know me, you can text me. You can call me. Tell me whatever you want to tell me about the
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.840]  podcast, but I'd love to hear what you think of this garden checklist. If there's something I
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.960]  missed, let me know. We'll do a part two. Make sure you guys check out the next podcast. It will feature
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.920]  Kabuki J. Fox and it will be recorded live from the Cana Canyon. So big shout out to Kabuki J. Fox
[38:40.920 --> 38:46.440]  of Foxtrax and the Cana Canyon in Colorado Springs. Don't forget to check out our sponsor,
[38:46.440 --> 38:51.720]  you guys, Hitman Glass. Big shout out to Hitman Glass. I've got a brand new Hitman short stack.
[38:51.720 --> 38:57.960]  I really can't do this justice if I tried to describe it with words on a microphone. It's five
[38:57.960 --> 39:04.120]  disc perks stacked on top of each other and they are welded together with what's called a Jesus
[39:04.120 --> 39:11.320]  seal. There are three Jesus seals holding each perk together. The discs are actually donuts and
[39:11.320 --> 39:16.600]  there is a tube that goes down the middle and it's got a hammerhead. So there's a down stem that goes
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.800]  into the rig. It's got a hammerhead perk. When you smoke through it, the water goes up through
[39:21.800 --> 39:27.480]  each disc and then it goes to the top disc where there is a drain that goes down back to the bottom
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.640]  through the center. I know I just confused the shit out of your head, but I will post a picture
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.360]  of this to Instagram so that you can check it out. A huge, huge shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.520]  Make sure you follow them on Instagram. Let them know that you heard about them from the Grow From
[39:40.520 --> 39:45.960]  Your Heart podcast. We would all appreciate that. You guys, now that the show is over, I would
[39:45.960 --> 39:50.360]  appreciate it if you go to the iTunes store, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, find the
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.440]  review section, give me a five-star rating, and after that, type in a comment and let me know what
[39:54.440 --> 39:59.400]  you think of the show and I will read your comments on a future episode. I know I haven't done that in
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.560]  a while. I'm trying to save up a couple and once we've got enough there, I'll go and read three or
[40:03.560 --> 40:08.680]  four, four or five comments and we'll share that with you. So I'd appreciate it if you go and do that.
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.080]  What that does is that exposes the show to more people. It'll move us up in the rankings.
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.040]  More people will see the podcast. More people will listen. More people will grow better cannabis.
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.320]  And that's the main goal here is just get more people to grow better cannabis. Yeah, you guys,
[40:23.320 --> 40:26.600]  don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode is always and
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.720]  forever archived on iReedGeneticsColorado.com. Don't forget about the donation button on the
[40:31.720 --> 40:35.240]  website. You guys on the top right, if you go to iReedGeneticsColorado.com, click on the Grow
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.760]  From Your Heart podcast tab. At the top right, there is a donation button that goes directly to
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.000]  my PayPal account. I've said it before, I'm never going to charge you for this podcast. This podcast
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.480]  is always going to be free. But if you'd like to make a contribution, I would truly appreciate it.
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.120]  If you're curious where your contribution goes, it goes to paying for the hosting of my website.
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.800]  It goes for things like new microphone covers. I try to have microphone covers for the guests
[40:55.800 --> 40:59.720]  because they do this kind of stuff. You hear that? They rub their faces all over the microphones when
[40:59.720 --> 41:03.400]  they're talking because they're new. So I try to have a cover for each guest so they don't have to
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.000]  go rubbing their face on another person's mic cover. I just think that that's gross.
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.640]  Water bottles for all of the guests. But mostly it goes to covering the Bluehost website,
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.160]  which is where I host, or the Bluehost hosting fee, which is where I have my website, which is
[41:17.160 --> 41:22.600]  where I host this show. There's 113 episodes up there, so it does take a little bit of bandwidth.
[41:22.600 --> 41:25.560]  Anyway, I'm just letting you know where that goes. I'm not begging. If you'd like to contribute,
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.240]  I would definitely, definitely appreciate it. I'd give you a big shout out on the show,
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.680]  send you a couple of stickers. Let's see, what else do I have for you? Make sure you listen
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.840]  next week. You guys will have Foxtracks on. I think that's all I've got. Please follow me on
[41:36.920 --> 41:41.080]  Instagram, irie underscore genetics on Instagram. I'm going to give a huge shout out to my ninja
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.800]  Spence. Thanks again for listening. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[43:07.160 --> 43:12.040]  answering my private call. Who's calling me from my unknown number?
