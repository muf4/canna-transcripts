[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  And action! Here we go you bad motherfuckers. Welcome to episode 486 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  And you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  You know I like to start the show off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.000 --> 00:31.000]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Daywrecker BX Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  This is a blend of peach, wrecker, and daywrecker.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  On the package, the flavor is described as gas, fuel, and chem.
[00:38.000 --> 00:46.000]  I will absolutely agree with that, but there is also a touch of sweetness, which I believe probably comes from the peach wrecker.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  This is a delicious concentrate. It's got me real talkative. It's got me kind of buzzy.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  On the back of the package, it does say this product contains 52.31% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  I really do enjoy the flavor and the buzz from the Daywrecker BX Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  The amount of diamonds to the amount of sauce was perfect. It's always great to have a nice perfect ratio.
[01:10.000 --> 01:18.000]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and perfect Daywrecker BX Full Spectrum Extract concentrate.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Before we get there, you know how I like to do it. Let's do some shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to our new friend OkiGrow720.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  How about a big thank you shout out to our friend Hogan's Farms.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  Of course, a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to Tanner M.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to our buddy Bjorn.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out to our buddy Reefer Madness.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  Of course, we need to send a big thank you shout out to Captain Mojo.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  And last but certainly not least, I'd like to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast high five shout out and a thank you to our friend Paul A.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Big thank you, big high five, big fist bump, big holiday greeting to everybody who supports the show.
[02:05.000 --> 02:15.000]  If you would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  And once again, big thank you to everybody who supports the show.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  All right. I feel like it's been far too long since I've given you a garden update.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  So let's talk briefly about what is happening in the IRI Genetics garden.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  I'm currently working with the reversed blueberry cookies.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  I am replenishing the TMNT line.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  So I am remaking the Michelangelo, the Raphael, the Donatello, the Leonardo, and of course the Bebop and Rocksteady.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Their mother plants were pollinated today by the reversed blueberry cookies.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  So in 50 to 60 days from now, those seeds will be finished growing.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Then I need harvest time.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Then of course I need packaging time.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Then those seeds will be available at all of the popular outlets.
[03:00.000 --> 03:09.000]  While I was replenishing that line, I may have added another or possibly another couple of females to the room so we can make a few new crosses.
[03:09.000 --> 03:17.000]  I'm not sure I'm ready to reveal the secret on what those new crosses may be, but when the time comes, I will announce it here on the podcast first.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  And by the way, if you hear the tickle in my nose, sometimes it sounds like I might sneeze.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  That is because I was in the room filled with pollen and I'm going to have a runny nose for the next 24 hours, but it was worth it.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  You're welcome.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  So that's what is happening in the Irie Genetics breeding garden right now.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  I will keep you updated as to how it goes.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  I'll let you know how the seeds look.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  I'll let you know when it's harvested.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  That way you can stay on top of it and know when they will be ready.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  All right.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  At the top of the show, I did say we were going to read some listener emails.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  So let's jump right into the email portion of this episode.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  The first email in today's episode goes just like this.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I'm a longtime listener of the podcast and I absolutely love your show.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  I truly learn a lot from you as I have a strong passion for growing.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  Well, I'm glad you're listening.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  I'm glad you found us and I'm glad you share a passion for cannabis.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  The message goes on to say, two weeks ago, I received, I'm not going to say the name of the seeds or the name of the vendor here.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  I'm going to leave some details out just to be classy.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  The names will be changed to protect the innocent.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  The message goes on.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  It says, I received seeds from a vendor and all five of those seeds were very small and gray colored.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  All right.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  That's kind of disappointing.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  I see where this is headed.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  When we pay money for seeds, we hope to open the package and see big, fat, healthy seeds in there.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Sometimes a strain won't make giant seeds.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Some strains just make little seeds.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  That's what they do.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  Some strains don't make tiger stripe seeds, but we still hope to find quality, healthy seeds in our packages.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  And as a breeder, it is our responsibility to select quality seeds that we put in the packages.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  So it's a bummer to find unhealthy looking seeds.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  That is just disheartening and makes you feel weird from the beginning of the grow.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  Let's keep going on.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It says, I germinated three of the seeds using the cup of water into a paper towel method.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  So we soak them in a cup of water for 12 hours, then folded them up into a paper towel.
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  And it says he let them soak in the paper towel for 24 hours and the tap roots sprouted an eighth of an inch.
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.000]  I potted them into solo cups filled with two thirds cocoa, one third perlite, and wetted the medium prior to planting the seeds.
[05:29.000 --> 05:37.000]  The seeds sprouted three days later underneath a 250 watt metal halide, four feet above the plant.
[05:38.000 --> 05:50.000]  And then I gradually lower the light to approximately 20 inches above the plant with my ballast on a dim setting to make sure I do not give too much light to these small plants.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  It sounds like you're off to a good start.
[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  It says the temperature stayed consistently around 77 degrees and the relative humidity was around 60%.
[05:59.000 --> 06:06.000]  My seeds stopped stretching, but the first true leaves grew at an incredibly slow rate.
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  So far, it sounds like you correctly germinated the seeds.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  It sounds like you potted them correctly into a decent mix.
[06:13.000 --> 06:16.000]  A 250 watt light will work for the seeds.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  Four feet above may have been a little bit high, but it says you slowly lowered that light to 20 inches.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  From your message, it sounds like you're doing things correctly.
[06:25.000 --> 06:30.000]  You've got 77 degrees and 60% humidity, which is ideal for those little plants.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  It goes on to say that you are getting incredibly slow growth.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  Then it says it has now been 10 days since the seeds popped through the soil and began to see the light.
[06:40.000 --> 06:48.000]  When I watered them, I made sure all the medium got wet and I allowed for adequate runoff and discarded the remaining water from the tray.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  My seedlings are two inches tall and are very small for 10 days out of the medium.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  Reviews for this company were not good when I finally did some research.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  I believe that these seeds are just very low quality, but I would like to hear your opinion on this.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong and maybe you can help me.
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  I know you are very passionate about your job, so I now ordered a batch of your feminized orange chasm seeds from Seeds Here Now,
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  and I am hoping for great success using these quality seeds.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  So that is a great place to jump in.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  You are absolutely correct in thinking you may just have low quality seeds.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  There is a reason why I did not say the breeder or the vendor or the name of the strain on this show.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  I'm just trying to be respectful. There's no need for me to say anything bad about them.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  You've already experienced it. You know not to mess with them.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  I'm not going to blast them out on the podcast and start a problem with anybody.
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  But in reality, unfortunately, it sounds like you have bought seeds that are not high quality.
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  You've got seeds that were probably harvested too early, or those plants were not fed properly,
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  or there was a problem in the grow.
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.000]  Most likely, the plants were taken too early and those seeds were not ready from the description you give of their growth.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  So we are going to blame the grow problems on low quality seeds.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  But we are going to blame the overall problem on a lack of research before purchasing the seeds.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  That was where you made the mistake, and that's okay.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.000]  We all make mistakes.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  But you've learned. You've found out that that company is not worth spending your money with.
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  And you have since then purchased some high quality feminized seeds.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  So you grew those less than high quality seeds out.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  You saw what they did.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  Now you will see what some high quality iRegenetics seeds will do for you.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Hopefully, when those seeds grow, they re-instill your confidence,
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  and you'll realize that the problem was with those other seeds and not you.
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  So you wrap up the message by saying,
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  Thank you so much for taking time to read this,
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on my situation.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  You are more than welcome to use my name.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  Then they sign it with,
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Sincerely, Johnny Skids.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  So big shout out to my new friend, Johnny Skids.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  Thank you for the great message.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  It is unfortunate that you bought seeds from a company that is unreputable,
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  a company that sold you shitty seeds,
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  a company that basically ripped you off and took your money.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  I feel bad that that happened to you,
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  but it is a great learning lesson,
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  not only for yourself,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  but for everybody listening to this show now.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  I'm telling you that you can learn from this listener,
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  from our new friend, Johnny Skids.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  Don't make the same mistake, you guys.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  If you're going to buy seeds, there are several,
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  there are many reliable and reputable seed companies out there.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  You don't have to buy iRegenetic seeds.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  That would be my preference, of course,
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  but I think it's like music.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  It's like food.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  My brand may not be the one that gets your taste.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  If there's another brand, another strain,
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  another seed line out there that gets your eye,
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  that gets your attention, check it out.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  If you want to put that in your grow room,
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.000]  I encourage you to do that.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Be happy. Grow what you want.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  But do research before you purchase those seeds.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  You're going to spend a lot of money on a package of seeds.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Then you've got to wait for them to get shipped.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  That's always stressful,
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  depending on where they're coming from and where they're going to.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Then you've got to germinate them.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  That is always a stressful situation,
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  even for a grower like myself with a lot of experience,
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  a lot of patience, a lot of understanding,
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  a lot of resources.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  It is often stressful trying to germinate seeds.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  If I found three or five seeds of something rare that I really want,
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  there's a little bit of anxiety trying to germinate those.
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  I really need those to work.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  So it does, I understand.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  I am in the same position as you.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  I've been there.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  I understand what it's like spending money on seeds
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  and hoping to get something out of it.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  So it's stressful.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  We're spending money on seeds.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  You've got to get them there.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  You've got to germinate them.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  Then you're going to spend money on all of the shit it needs to grow them.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  You need soil.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  You need pots.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  You need electricity.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  You need lights.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  You need space.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  Then you're going to invest time and your energy
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  and hopefully some love into these plants.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  So before you do any of that,
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  set yourself up for success by doing research on,
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  first, the strain you're looking for.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Is this really the strain?
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  I think it is.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  Is this the right strain for me?
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  Will it smell?
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  Will it smoke?
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  Will it medicate the way that I'm expecting it to?
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  Will it grow the way I'm expecting it to?
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  Do some research.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Then research the breeder.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Is that breeder a reputable person?
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  Are they reliable?
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  Are they known for having good customer service?
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  Also see if that strain came from that breeder.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  Sometimes another breeder will be secondhand making a strain
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  that doesn't really belong to them,
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  but they're just kind of outcrossing or encrossing something
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  and kind of capitalizing on another popular strain.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  So make sure that you're getting the strain you want
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  from the closest original source that you can find it from.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  If you want a rise, get a rise from me.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Don't get a rise from somebody else that made an arise outcross
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  and is trying to capitalize on my work.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  I know that sounds strange,
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  but that is what a lot of unreputable and unscrupulous breeders will do.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  So try to get as close to the source as possible
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  when you're looking for the strain that you've fallen in love with.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  So research the strain.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  Research the breeder.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  Find out about that breeder's customer service.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  Are they a good breeder?
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Are they a good person?
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  Do they have a good reputation online?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  Have you ever met them?
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  Do you have any other friends that have met them?
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  The cannabis world and the cannabis industry is becoming larger,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  but it's also becoming smaller at the same time.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  We're just normal people.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  We know people just like you do.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  You probably know somebody that knows me personally
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  if you were in the cannabis industry or cannabis world at all.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  It's getting very small.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  We all go to the same events.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  We're all at the same parties.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  It's one big happy family.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  So somebody out there knows the breeder that you were trying to buy seeds from.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  Then again, you have to worry about gossip and bullshit
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  because that is also prevalent in this industry.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  So do your research before you buy seeds.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Research the strain.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  Research the breeder.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Then you have to research the vendor.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Where are you buying the seeds?
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Are you getting them from seedsherenow.com,
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  which I can highly recommend?
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  I will vouch for them all day.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  Are you getting them from randomfuckingseedbank.net
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  that you have no idea where they're coming from?
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  You don't know who represents that company.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  You don't know what country they're in.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  They may just take your money and run.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  They may take your money and send you a bunch of gray seeds
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  that look like shit and grow out to be a bunch of mutants
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  like they did to our new friend Johnny Skids here.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  So don't fall for advertising.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  Don't fall for discounted prices.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  Don't fall for hype.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Do your research.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  Something you should really think about in today's cannabis seed market
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  is fake strain recreation.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Sometimes, one thing that really drives me crazy
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  is I see people saying that they have got Gorilla Glue No. 4 seeds.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  Now let's talk about why that cannot be a thing.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Gorilla Glue No. 4 is a clone-only plant,
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  which means there are no male plants of Gorilla Glue to be found.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  The person who made Gorilla Glue never released a male of it.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  The Gorilla Glue was made on accident to the best of my knowledge.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  A few seeds of the Gorilla Glue were grown.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  The keepers, to the best of my knowledge,
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  were known as Gorilla Glue No. 4 and Gorilla Glue No. 7,
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  which tells me there were probably somewhere between 1 and 10 seeds, right?
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  We've got at least 4. We've got at least 7.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  There were probably 10 seeds planted.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Numbers 4 and 7 were probably the keepers.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Those became popular.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  No. 7 was not circulated very much.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  Gorilla Glue No. 4 was very sought after
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  and was circulated online and through trading and through events
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  and through the cannabis community very rapidly and very widely.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  I had my hands on a Gorilla Glue No. 4 cut very early in the game.
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  So the main part is, Gorilla Glue No. 4 was a specific phenotype of that cross.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  It was No. 4. It was the No. 4 seed to be grown.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  It was the selected cultivar out of that batch of seeds.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  So Gorilla Glue No. 4 is a female.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  There is not a male of Gorilla Glue No. 4.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  So when people say they have seeds of Gorilla Glue No. 4,
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  they cannot have them unless they are feminized, selfed seeds.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  And that would make it a Gorilla Glue No. 4S1 feminized seed.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  That is possible.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  You would take a GG4 clone, you would reverse it,
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  and you would pollinate a GG4 clone with that pollen.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  That would make a GG4S1 feminized seed.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  That is possible.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  But I see companies advertising Gorilla Glue No. 4 regular seeds.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  There is not a Gorilla Glue No. 4 male to breed that with to make those seeds.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  And if there were, that would be a Gorilla Glue No. 4F2.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  So it's not Gorilla Glue No. 4.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  You as a consumer have to be careful because some of the breeding companies
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  will try to trick you into buying a cross that is not exactly what it is labeled.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  Then what will happen is you will grow that cross,
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  and you put it out to the market, whether it is the free market or the medical market,
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  and you label it Gorilla Glue No. 4.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  And then people think that that's Gorilla Glue No. 4 when it really isn't.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Or even worse, people say,
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Hey, motherfucker, this is not Gorilla Glue No. 4.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Why are you selling me this bullshit?
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  This is what GG4 should really smell like.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  So if somebody's got a Gorilla Glue No. 4 regular seed,
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  it is probably a back cross or it is straight-up fake.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  And a back cross would mean that they took Gorilla Glue No. 4
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  and bred it to something else.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  Then they may have gone back to the Gorilla Glue No. 4 with its offspring,
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  but most likely, if they're going to lie to you about that already,
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  they probably did not do that work.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  They took something that looks like GG4,
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  they pollinated the GG4,
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  and they sold you seeds and said that is GG4 when it is not.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  My point is that as a consumer, you have got to educate yourself
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  because there are many unscrupulous, unreputable companies out there
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  with no morals who are only out there to take your money.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  And unfortunately, they got our buddy, Johnny Skids.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this email got away from me.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  I got super ranty on this one.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  I should wrap it up by saying, if you would like reliable seeds,
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  I highly suggest iReed Genetics,
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
