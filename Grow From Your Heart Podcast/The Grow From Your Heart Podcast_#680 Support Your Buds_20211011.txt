[00:03.260 --> 00:17.010]  All right, here we go.
[00:17.010 --> 00:18.570]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:18.570 --> 00:25.010]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 680 of the Grow From Your
[00:25.010 --> 00:26.430]  Heart Podcast.
[00:26.430 --> 00:29.710]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of grow questions.
[00:29.710 --> 00:33.130]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:33.130 --> 00:36.490]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:36.490 --> 00:40.670]  Let's start off with the Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Jessica Kay.
[00:40.670 --> 00:44.650]  Let's send a thank you shout out and a fist bump to Justin C. I want to send a big thank
[00:44.650 --> 00:47.390]  you shout out to my buddy Fiscal's Organics.
[00:47.390 --> 00:49.570]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Polo Paul.

[00:53.850 --> 00:57.410]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Jackie Daytona and
[00:57.410 --> 00:58.970]  Grow Man Stan.
[00:58.970 --> 01:01.050]  Let's send a big fist bump to Sam Heads.
[01:01.050 --> 01:04.250]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to my buddy Stoner Dave.
[01:04.250 --> 01:06.410]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Kojax.
[01:06.410 --> 01:08.930]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Grow Bandit.
[01:08.930 --> 01:12.250]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:12.250 --> 01:15.810]  to a longtime supporter, my buddy Gramps Memel.
[01:15.810 --> 01:20.530]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:20.530 --> 01:24.170]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:44.090 --> 01:45.090]  server.
[01:45.090 --> 01:46.450]  I do have a discord server.
[01:46.450 --> 01:49.090]  There's a link in the show notes and the video description.
[01:49.090 --> 01:53.050]  A lot of members of the iRi Army, the Grow From Your Heart crew, just a bunch of great
[01:53.090 --> 01:56.850]  folks who are interested in iRi genetics, the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, all things
[01:56.850 --> 01:58.090]  Rasta Jeff.
[01:58.090 --> 02:02.370]  They're hanging out on the discord channel and we do invite you to join the party.
[02:02.370 --> 02:05.850]  There's a link again in the show notes and the video description.
[02:05.850 --> 02:07.170]  Join us, don't miss the party.
[02:07.170 --> 02:08.570]  That's all I've got for discord today.
[02:08.570 --> 02:09.730]  Let's keep the opening quick.
[02:09.730 --> 02:11.230]  Let's get right to the point.
[02:11.230 --> 02:14.290]  You may notice I've got some cotton mouth on the microphone.
[02:14.290 --> 02:16.370]  I apologize if that's coming through the recording.
[02:16.370 --> 02:18.770]  I feel like my lips are clicking and sticking.
[02:18.770 --> 02:20.850]  I took some dabs of some concentrates.
[02:20.850 --> 02:24.930]  I have some The Machine Live Rosin that a Denver grower grew.
[02:24.930 --> 02:26.770]  They don't want to be talked about on the show.
[02:26.770 --> 02:28.770]  They kind of want to remain anonymous.
[02:28.770 --> 02:32.370]  But I've got a friend, I gave some tester seeds of The Machine to them.
[02:32.370 --> 02:33.450]  It's a couple.
[02:33.450 --> 02:35.930]  They got some seeds in Denver and they grew them.
[02:35.930 --> 02:38.690]  I recently went to Denver to hang out and they dabbed me out with some and I was like,
[02:38.690 --> 02:39.690]  I need some of that.
[02:39.690 --> 02:40.690]  They're like, don't worry, here's a jar.
[02:40.690 --> 02:42.810]  They sent me home with a little jar of The Machine.
[02:42.810 --> 02:44.330]  I took a dab of it.
[02:44.330 --> 02:47.890]  I've got this extreme cotton mouth.
[02:47.890 --> 02:49.290]  The first thing I noticed, I blew it out.
[02:49.290 --> 02:50.850]  I was like, I'm dehydrated.
[02:50.850 --> 02:52.850]  It was just like desert weed or something.
[02:52.850 --> 02:55.090]  As soon as I blew it out, my whole face, my mouth.
[02:55.090 --> 02:59.250]  Anyway, my point is I apologize for the dehydrated sounds in the microphone here.
[02:59.250 --> 03:01.450]  If you were hearing that, I apologize.
[03:01.450 --> 03:05.930]  Also, I apologize if I appear and appear, that's the only word for it.
[03:05.930 --> 03:10.850]  If I appear disheveled or stunned, that dab made me feel like, I don't know, I felt like
[03:10.850 --> 03:14.290]  I got the Men in Black fucking thing, the little zapper right to my eyes and I forgot
[03:14.290 --> 03:15.290]  life.
[03:15.290 --> 03:16.290]  I forgot where I was.
[03:16.290 --> 03:17.290]  I forgot what I had to do.
[03:17.690 --> 03:19.850]  I was like sitting there dabbing before the show, reading stuff.
[03:19.850 --> 03:23.090]  We'll talk about what I was reading here in just a second when I get done rambling.
[03:23.090 --> 03:25.530]  I took that dab and life just, everything just shut down.
[03:25.530 --> 03:28.690]  I was like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, where I'm supposed to be.
[03:28.690 --> 03:32.770]  I feel a little disheveled here in front of all the lights with the camera.
[03:32.770 --> 03:35.450]  It was a lot to come to after taking that dab.
[03:35.450 --> 03:37.490]  Big shout out to my friend who does not want to be named.
[03:37.490 --> 03:38.610]  They do not want to be named.
[03:38.610 --> 03:40.210]  They're a lovely couple in Denver.
[03:40.210 --> 03:41.210]  That's all the info you need.
[03:41.210 --> 03:42.770]  That's probably too much already.
[03:42.770 --> 03:45.810]  You guys did a wonderful job on The Machine.
[03:45.810 --> 03:46.810]  Live rosin.
[03:47.330 --> 03:51.370]  They went through the plants, they harvested them, they fresh froze the plants, then they
[03:51.370 --> 03:54.930]  turned those plants into bubble hash basically.
[03:54.930 --> 03:58.210]  Then they took the bubble hash and pressed that into rosin.
[03:58.210 --> 04:00.570]  So nice process happened there.
[04:00.570 --> 04:01.610]  The plants looked beautiful.
[04:01.610 --> 04:03.610]  The concentrates tasted amazing.
[04:03.610 --> 04:05.050]  I'm lit up from it obviously.
[04:05.050 --> 04:06.770]  I'm still fucking rambling about it.
[04:06.770 --> 04:08.010]  Anyway, got major cotton mouth.
[04:08.010 --> 04:12.650]  I apologize if it comes through on the microphone and I apologize if I seem stunned and confused
[04:12.650 --> 04:15.450]  because I fucking am.
[04:15.450 --> 04:16.450]  Shout out to those dabs.
[04:17.090 --> 04:19.570]  I did mention I was reading some stuff.
[04:19.570 --> 04:25.050]  I did read an article where some police discovered 77 pounds of cannabis and they tried to claim
[04:25.050 --> 04:28.290]  that it was worth $2.5 million.
[04:28.290 --> 04:31.050]  I sat there for a couple of minutes with my calculator trying to figure out where all
[04:31.050 --> 04:32.610]  my profits are going.
[04:32.610 --> 04:38.930]  If cannabis is worth $2.5 million for 77 pounds, we've been getting ripped off in Colorado.
[04:38.930 --> 04:40.290]  I tried to do the math on that.
[04:40.290 --> 04:45.290]  That has to be somewhere around $50 a gram if they are thinking that that weed was worth
[04:45.330 --> 04:46.330]  $2 million.
[04:46.330 --> 04:52.770]  Hey, Popo, the weed's not worth $50 a gram no matter what level you break it down to.
[04:52.770 --> 04:54.090]  They try to say that street level.
[04:54.090 --> 04:56.050]  Like yeah, the street level's not going to sell a pound.
[04:56.050 --> 04:57.370]  They're going to sell grams.
[04:57.370 --> 04:59.250]  Grams are not 50 bucks, officer.
[04:59.250 --> 05:01.490]  If you're paying, well yeah, officer, the grams are 50 bucks.
[05:01.490 --> 05:02.810]  You and Kyle keep paying that.
[05:02.810 --> 05:04.010]  Anyway, I just thought it was funny.
[05:04.010 --> 05:07.450]  The cops tried to say 77 pounds was worth $2 million.
[05:07.450 --> 05:09.770]  I did the math real quick and I was like, I've been getting ripped off.
[05:09.770 --> 05:11.370]  Where is all of my money?
[05:11.370 --> 05:16.690]  The commercial industry in Colorado would thrive if weed was worth $2 million for 77
[05:16.690 --> 05:17.690]  pounds.
[05:17.690 --> 05:18.690]  That would change a lot of things.
[05:18.690 --> 05:20.650]  All right, you guys, I told you I'm stoned and rambly.
[05:20.650 --> 05:24.170]  I just wanted to share with you that silly thing that I read on the internet there.
[05:24.170 --> 05:26.130]  That's what I was reading while I was dabbing.
[05:26.130 --> 05:27.610]  Welcome into Rasta Jeff's world.
[05:27.610 --> 05:31.490]  That was what was going on just a few minutes ago before we got in front of these bright
[05:31.490 --> 05:33.130]  ass lights and tried to do a show.
[05:33.130 --> 05:36.490]  I do have some messages here in front of me that I want to jump into.
[05:36.490 --> 05:39.690]  If not, I'm just going to continue to ramble aimlessly.
[05:39.690 --> 05:40.690]  Let's get to this message.
[05:40.690 --> 05:43.650]  Does this person want their name said on the show?
[05:43.650 --> 05:45.530]  First, you can shout me out.
[05:45.530 --> 05:46.930]  Call me old ball coach.
[05:46.930 --> 05:49.890]  It's an awkward name, but what up old ball coach?
[05:49.890 --> 05:51.250]  Thank you for joining the show.
[05:51.250 --> 05:55.810]  It says I'm a second time grower with a 25 year layoff.
[05:55.810 --> 05:58.290]  It sounds like you took a little bit of a break there.
[05:58.290 --> 06:00.850]  It says I love the podcast and the YouTube.
[06:00.850 --> 06:02.290]  Let's get straight to the point.
[06:02.290 --> 06:06.370]  I like that because I need something to get me to some sort of a point today.
[06:06.370 --> 06:07.370]  It goes on.
[06:07.370 --> 06:12.850]  Does one of your strains show a better resistance to mildew mold and bud rot?
[06:12.850 --> 06:17.730]  I realize weather conditions can and will affect my plant, but if you had one that was
[06:17.730 --> 06:20.810]  a little more resilient, which plant would it be?
[06:20.810 --> 06:22.850]  Then they briefly explained their indoor project.
[06:22.850 --> 06:26.170]  Then they remind us that this will be a project for 2022.
[06:26.170 --> 06:29.870]  Then they wrap it up with love you here in Virginia and we will definitely hug our mom
[06:29.870 --> 06:30.870]  for you.
[06:30.870 --> 06:34.010]  By the way, I prefer that eighties old school funk.
[06:34.010 --> 06:36.090]  Find it, grow it, let the people feel it.
[06:36.090 --> 06:37.170]  All right, that is perfect.
[06:37.970 --> 06:41.490]  I'm glad that you added that you like that old school funk because the strain recommendation
[06:41.490 --> 06:44.530]  I've got for you is an old school funky aroma.
[06:44.530 --> 06:48.290]  But before I get to making strain recommendations, let me give another big shout out to all of
[06:48.290 --> 06:49.530]  our friends in Virginia.
[06:49.530 --> 06:54.050]  I've been getting a lot of messages and friend requests from people in Virginia and welcome
[06:54.050 --> 06:55.050]  to the crew.
[06:55.050 --> 06:56.650]  It's been great to meet so many new people.
[06:56.650 --> 06:57.650]  Where'd you guys all come from?
[06:57.650 --> 07:01.010]  I had no idea there were that many cannabis enthusiasts in Virginia.
[07:01.010 --> 07:02.690]  You guys must've been keeping it real quiet.
[07:02.690 --> 07:03.690]  Welcome to the club.
[07:03.690 --> 07:04.690]  I'm glad to have you on the team.
[07:04.690 --> 07:06.090]  Glad to be a part of your team.
[07:06.090 --> 07:07.090]  Let's work together.
[07:07.130 --> 07:08.130]  Big shout out to Virginia.
[07:08.130 --> 07:10.930]  Uh, let me talk about this strain recommendation.
[07:10.930 --> 07:12.770]  Something I am noticing it is fall time.
[07:12.770 --> 07:14.530]  It's harvest time as I'm recording this.
[07:14.530 --> 07:17.090]  Uh, many people are in the process of harvesting.
[07:17.090 --> 07:19.930]  A lot of commercial outdoor grows have begun the outdoor harvest.
[07:19.930 --> 07:24.730]  Uh, if you've been watching the show, you know that I've got a, I had a greenhouse running.
[07:24.730 --> 07:26.050]  Most of those plants have come down.
[07:26.050 --> 07:27.450]  I've still got a couple out there.
[07:27.450 --> 07:28.450]  They're not quite done.
[07:28.450 --> 07:31.530]  I will let them go until it gets a little bit colder than they're going to have to come
[07:31.530 --> 07:32.530]  down.
[07:32.530 --> 07:35.170]  But I do have a greenhouse project that is coming down at this time.
[07:35.170 --> 07:36.170]  I was fortunate.
[07:36.290 --> 07:40.930]  Uh, none of my plants got any major powdery mildew, boitritis, bud rot issues.
[07:40.930 --> 07:44.970]  We had a touch of powdery mildew appearing right before harvest time, but no bud rot,
[07:44.970 --> 07:47.170]  no bud mold, no major issues.
[07:47.170 --> 07:51.770]  I was fortunate not to lose any of my plants, but I have had friends and have seen a lot
[07:51.770 --> 07:55.490]  of stories on social media and have heard a lot of stories about people losing their
[07:55.490 --> 08:00.610]  crop to bud rot and mold problems because of the crazy conditions we experienced this
[08:00.610 --> 08:01.610]  year.
[08:01.610 --> 08:03.490]  It was super hot for a long time.
[08:03.490 --> 08:04.930]  And then one night they went, guess what?
[08:04.930 --> 08:05.930]  I'm not going to be hot anymore.
[08:06.690 --> 08:07.690]  It's going to be stupid cold.
[08:07.690 --> 08:11.170]  And then we got a really cold night and then it was like, oh, that was just a joke.
[08:11.170 --> 08:12.370]  Back to the hot days.
[08:12.370 --> 08:14.690]  And then it was like, oh, how about rain for three or four days?
[08:14.690 --> 08:17.010]  And then we're going to go back to really hot again.
[08:17.010 --> 08:21.010]  It's been really weird for a few, a couple of fucking months here in Colorado.
[08:21.010 --> 08:22.370]  The weather has just been jumping around.
[08:22.370 --> 08:23.670]  It was hot, hot, hot.
[08:23.670 --> 08:27.370]  And then I guess nature had enough of that and wanted to just test out a few other things
[08:27.370 --> 08:30.010]  and she threw it all at us and it's starting to get cold already.
[08:30.010 --> 08:32.910]  I've had a hoodie on a couple of nights, a couple of evenings here.
[08:32.910 --> 08:34.530]  So the weather's changing rapidly.
[08:34.530 --> 08:37.170]  My point is a lot of people did get bud mold, bud rot.
[08:37.170 --> 08:39.330]  They had to throw away portions of their crop.
[08:39.330 --> 08:40.530]  Don't try to smoke that stuff.
[08:40.530 --> 08:43.450]  Don't sell that bud rot, bud moldy stuff to people.
[08:43.450 --> 08:44.850]  I've talked about that before.
[08:44.850 --> 08:48.250]  Have some ethics, grow from your heart, grow with love, take good care of the people that
[08:48.250 --> 08:50.050]  are going to smoke your product.
[08:50.050 --> 08:51.690]  Just that way you're a reliable grower.
[08:51.690 --> 08:53.370]  You're not a piece of shit person.
[08:53.370 --> 08:58.810]  But the easiest way to prevent this is to have genetics that are more resilient and
[08:58.810 --> 09:01.490]  resistant to these types of problems.
[09:01.490 --> 09:05.090]  If you know if you live in a climate where you're going to get bud rot, bud mold, stuff
[09:05.090 --> 09:06.090]  like that.
[09:06.090 --> 09:09.710]  If you grew this year and you had problems, you can expect those problems again next year.
[09:09.710 --> 09:11.570]  The problems are going to go away.
[09:11.570 --> 09:15.890]  The conditions will probably be the same unless you did something drastic to correct that
[09:15.890 --> 09:16.890]  environment.
[09:16.890 --> 09:19.930]  So let's talk about at least one or two of my strains I can recommend.
[09:19.930 --> 09:24.010]  I like to have a couple more than just one because when I do make this one recommendation,
[09:24.010 --> 09:26.170]  there's a good likelihood it will sell out quite quickly.
[09:26.170 --> 09:28.450]  So I've got a backup plan for you just in case.
[09:28.450 --> 09:33.690]  I do recommend the morning dew strain for an environment that is very susceptible to
[09:33.690 --> 09:34.690]  mold and mildew.
[09:34.690 --> 09:38.410]  If you know you're going to get those types of problems, the morning dew is a great strain
[09:38.410 --> 09:40.170]  to grow in that environment.
[09:40.170 --> 09:42.310]  It finishes in a decent amount of time.
[09:42.310 --> 09:43.810]  It should be done by the ninth week.
[09:43.810 --> 09:47.730]  You might want to let it finish that ninth week if your environment allows, but outside
[09:47.730 --> 09:49.370]  it does finish a little bit earlier.
[09:49.370 --> 09:53.050]  So by the end of eight, maybe nine weeks into flower, that plant should be done.
[09:53.050 --> 09:55.310]  It'll start turning beautiful colors.
[09:55.310 --> 09:57.210]  It stinks really well.
[09:57.610 --> 10:03.290]  That is one of my, if not the most resistant plant to powdery mildew, to bud mold, and
[10:03.290 --> 10:04.970]  also to other bugs.
[10:04.970 --> 10:06.450]  I don't see a lot of bugs on that one.
[10:06.450 --> 10:10.650]  If we get bugs in the room, that's the last plant that ever shows me bug problems.
[10:10.650 --> 10:15.130]  So the morning dew has been the plant that I've been recommending to like the people
[10:15.130 --> 10:18.850]  in Maine and Portland and places like that where they're getting a lot of humidity and
[10:18.850 --> 10:20.330]  powdery mildew issues.
[10:20.330 --> 10:23.010]  I recommend the morning dew.
[10:23.010 --> 10:27.650]  Another thing I'll really recommend for you guys in the same environment is the sun kiss.
[10:27.650 --> 10:28.650]  Sun kiss is great.
[10:28.650 --> 10:33.970]  It's very mold resistant and it finishes kind of early and it's very potent and it has those
[10:33.970 --> 10:38.370]  delicious orange candy, orange creamsicle turps.
[10:38.370 --> 10:43.250]  Now another thing this viewer, this listener did mention, they love that old school 80s
[10:43.250 --> 10:44.250]  funk.
[10:44.250 --> 10:49.490]  That's really going to help out with the morning dew because that smells like skunky, funky
[10:49.490 --> 10:50.730]  old school weed.
[10:50.730 --> 10:51.730]  I'm from California.
[10:51.730 --> 10:52.730]  I'm not trying to brag.
[10:53.450 --> 10:54.450]  I'm not.
[10:54.450 --> 10:55.450]  That doesn't even matter.
[10:55.450 --> 10:57.530]  But I remember what old California weed smelled like is where I'm headed and the morning dew
[10:57.530 --> 11:00.570]  has got some of that old California weed smell to it.
[11:00.570 --> 11:03.870]  I hear a lot of the older guys complain that we've kind of washed out some of those good
[11:03.870 --> 11:07.570]  smells and good aromas with all this cake and candy bullshit that we've made now in
[11:07.570 --> 11:08.890]  the strains.
[11:08.890 --> 11:09.890]  Sometimes I do agree.
[11:09.890 --> 11:14.370]  I miss that old California, just that skunk weed that my family used to get in California.
[11:14.370 --> 11:17.130]  That shit used to smell so good and it's hard to find now.
[11:17.130 --> 11:22.250]  I've got some stuff that fills that void that fits that genre, but it's not the same as
[11:22.250 --> 11:24.350]  it used to be and we're all chasing it now.
[11:24.350 --> 11:28.130]  It looks like skunk is going to be the popular terp coming back.
[11:28.130 --> 11:29.770]  Things come and go in phases.
[11:29.770 --> 11:32.970]  For a while there, it was diesel and chem dog.
[11:32.970 --> 11:37.450]  And then as weed got legal and popular, the strain that happened to be super popular in
[11:37.450 --> 11:41.290]  that realm in that time frame was of course the Girl Scout cookies.
[11:41.290 --> 11:43.890]  That strain was fucking super popular.
[11:43.890 --> 11:48.090]  Right along that same time frame, we got the Gorilla Glue number four.
[11:48.090 --> 11:53.970]  Then after that, all of the cookie crosses that were real candy flavored like the gelatos,
[11:53.970 --> 11:56.650]  the biscottis, all that sort of stuff started popping up.
[11:56.650 --> 11:58.350]  A lot of that is from the cookie code.
[11:58.350 --> 12:00.290]  They made a lot of that stuff popular.
[12:00.290 --> 12:02.170]  But then we started seeing a lot of garlicky shit.
[12:02.170 --> 12:03.450]  I love the garlicky shit.
[12:03.450 --> 12:07.290]  But I think the next thing that's coming or coming back is we're going to go back to that
[12:07.290 --> 12:08.290]  skunky shit.
[12:08.290 --> 12:10.350]  That's what people want again.
[12:10.350 --> 12:16.250]  Maybe it's because the people my age were able to afford it and it's legal.
[12:17.210 --> 12:20.170]  We were smoking when we were teenagers when it was popular.
[12:20.170 --> 12:21.810]  Everybody was smoking back then when it was popular.
[12:21.810 --> 12:22.810]  Now it's legal.
[12:22.810 --> 12:25.610]  We want that shit we smoked back in the day so it's getting popular again.
[12:25.610 --> 12:28.010]  It's just like music, just like clothing.
[12:28.010 --> 12:33.490]  That shit just seems to kind of, the popular shit just cycles back around, comes back around.
[12:33.490 --> 12:36.970]  Pretty soon, what I'm getting at is I think that skunk will be the popular terp again.
[12:36.970 --> 12:39.770]  That's going to be the thing everybody's looking for.
[12:39.770 --> 12:43.170]  To make a long story short, which it may be way too fucking late for that, the strain
[12:43.170 --> 12:46.930]  I would recommend for your outdoor environment where you're going to face mold and mildew
[12:46.930 --> 12:52.210]  problems, the number one recommendation for that would be the morning dew.
[12:52.210 --> 12:53.210]  Check out some morning dew.
[12:53.210 --> 12:57.130]  If that is not available and if you're not into that skunky smell, your next option would
[12:57.130 --> 13:00.050]  be the sun kiss.
[13:00.050 --> 13:03.490]  I want to thank my friend, Ol' Ball Coach.
[13:03.490 --> 13:08.210]  I can make so many bad, bad jokes about that, but I'm going to try to stay on track today.
[13:08.210 --> 13:11.250]  Obviously, I could go on a good ramble on that one.
[13:11.250 --> 13:13.330]  Let's keep me a little bit focused.
[13:13.330 --> 13:14.330]  Thank you for the great message.
[13:14.330 --> 13:16.650]  If you do have any more questions, follow up.
[13:16.650 --> 13:17.810]  I'd love to hear back from you.
[13:17.810 --> 13:20.570]  All right, I've got another message here in front of me.
[13:20.570 --> 13:24.610]  This one, I don't think they wanted their name said because I did not copy the name
[13:24.610 --> 13:25.610]  down.
[13:25.610 --> 13:27.290]  I cut and pasted this and printed it out.
[13:27.290 --> 13:30.530]  Your name did not come along with this, so I apologize if you wanted a shout out on the
[13:30.530 --> 13:31.530]  show.
[13:31.530 --> 13:32.970]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[13:32.970 --> 13:36.530]  I have some seeds from a very well-known breeder.
[13:36.530 --> 13:37.530]  Words are hard today, you guys.
[13:37.530 --> 13:38.530]  I apologize.
[13:38.530 --> 13:40.170]  That dab has got me wrecked still.
[13:40.170 --> 13:41.170]  I enjoy it.
[13:41.170 --> 13:42.170]  I like it.
[13:42.170 --> 13:43.170]  I hope you can keep up with me.
[13:43.170 --> 13:44.170]  It goes on.
[13:44.170 --> 13:48.810]  It says, I have some seeds from a very well-known breeder and they are light in color.
[13:48.810 --> 13:52.690]  I've grown your seeds and these don't come close to the same color.
[13:52.690 --> 13:55.410]  Yeah, some seeds will come out very dark.
[13:55.410 --> 13:59.090]  Some seeds come out kind of a light gray silvery color.
[13:59.090 --> 14:04.250]  That's not uncommon, but some seeds that are not all the way done will also be light in
[14:04.250 --> 14:05.250]  color.
[14:05.250 --> 14:09.090]  I would have to see a picture of the seeds to have a real opinion of these seeds, but
[14:09.090 --> 14:15.770]  it says, my question is, what are the chances of getting a viable plant if they even germinate?
[14:15.770 --> 14:16.930]  Thanks for all you do, man.
[14:16.930 --> 14:20.890]  I am much more, a much more confident grower due to your podcast.
[14:20.890 --> 14:22.610]  So much great info.
[14:22.610 --> 14:25.890]  That's a great compliment, hearing that you are a more confident grower because of the
[14:25.890 --> 14:26.890]  show.
[14:26.890 --> 14:27.890]  That means a lot to me.
[14:27.890 --> 14:31.410]  Building confidence is a good thing, but let me stick to the point here.
[14:31.410 --> 14:36.010]  The only way to find out if those seeds are going to germinate is to attempt to germinate
[14:36.010 --> 14:37.010]  them.
[14:37.010 --> 14:39.410]  If they germinate, will they even give you a viable plant?
[14:39.410 --> 14:40.410]  Yes.
[14:40.410 --> 14:44.450]  If they do germinate and a stem comes out or a tail comes out, a root comes out, and
[14:44.450 --> 14:47.930]  you start building a plant out of that, yes, that is a viable plant.
[14:47.930 --> 14:51.170]  That will be a good plant.
[14:51.170 --> 14:56.490]  The customers, the clientele, the people purchasing the seeds, they do prefer the big beefy seeds
[14:56.490 --> 15:01.110]  with all the coloration, all the tiger striping or fancy designs on them.
[15:01.110 --> 15:04.690]  So those are what most of the customers get in a retail environment.
[15:04.730 --> 15:09.010]  I grow a lot of those ugly seeds that you guys would complain about that I'd probably
[15:09.010 --> 15:11.370]  get an email from somebody if I sent them to you.
[15:11.370 --> 15:15.050]  I grow those a lot of the time, and they make amazing plants.
[15:15.050 --> 15:18.050]  They're the same as the seeds you got with all the other color.
[15:18.050 --> 15:19.330]  They just don't look as good.
[15:19.330 --> 15:20.890]  I put them in another pile.
[15:20.890 --> 15:23.410]  They are B or C-graded seeds.
[15:23.410 --> 15:26.170]  Sometimes I give B and C-grade seeds out to my friends.
[15:26.170 --> 15:27.170]  Just here you go.
[15:27.170 --> 15:28.170]  You want some seeds?
[15:28.170 --> 15:31.530]  Take them, bro, because I can't sell these to the customers because they will email me
[15:31.650 --> 15:35.090]  and tell me that I sold them shit seeds before they even tried to grow them.
[15:35.090 --> 15:38.050]  So the only way to find out if those are good is to germinate them.
[15:38.050 --> 15:42.050]  If they pop for you and if a tail comes out, those are good seeds.
[15:42.050 --> 15:44.610]  Sometimes they just don't make dark colors.
[15:44.610 --> 15:48.110]  Something else I've noticed, if you take a seed that has got a lot of stripes and a lot
[15:48.110 --> 15:51.570]  of colors on it, and you lick your fingers and get your fingers good and moist and roll
[15:51.570 --> 15:56.610]  that seed around in your fingers, sometimes that coloration and that pigment will come
[15:56.610 --> 15:58.210]  right off of that seed.
[15:58.210 --> 16:00.930]  So I don't know how important those stripes are.
[16:00.930 --> 16:04.570]  They let me know when my seeds are ready, when I'm breeding, when I'm making the seeds.
[16:04.570 --> 16:10.410]  They let me select seeds for you, but it's not a 100% determination on the quality of
[16:10.410 --> 16:11.410]  the seed.
[16:11.410 --> 16:16.430]  The way to find out, like I keep saying, germinate that seed, grow it, see what it does for you.
[16:16.430 --> 16:21.050]  If you really want to get scientific about it, make a documentation of maybe number your
[16:21.050 --> 16:25.330]  seeds one through 10 and then germinate them and always keep that number attached to that
[16:25.330 --> 16:26.330]  seed.
[16:26.330 --> 16:27.730]  This was seed number one, seed number two.
[16:27.730 --> 16:31.570]  And then when you plant them, make notes of this was the really pale seed or this seed
[16:31.570 --> 16:34.250]  was darker, this seed was really soft.
[16:34.250 --> 16:35.770]  Make notes and then see how they grow.
[16:35.770 --> 16:39.570]  Did that pale, shitty looking seed turn out to be one of your best plants?
[16:39.570 --> 16:40.730]  Because you never know.
[16:40.730 --> 16:42.370]  It just might work out that way.
[16:42.370 --> 16:44.090]  It's hard to predict and it's hard to guess.
[16:44.090 --> 16:49.190]  If it does germinate and it turns into a viable plant, then yes, it was a good seed.
[16:49.190 --> 16:53.610]  As long as it germinated and turned into a plant, then let's see what it does from there.
[16:53.610 --> 16:58.730]  That's kind of the fun and the guest game and the surprise and the magic of growing
[16:58.730 --> 16:59.730]  cannabis.
[16:59.730 --> 17:01.650]  I love seeing what that seed will hold.
[17:01.650 --> 17:04.090]  You never know what is going to come from a seed.
[17:04.090 --> 17:05.890]  Sometimes you could grow complete crap.
[17:05.890 --> 17:09.890]  You could grow a bunch of hemp that you've got to throw away or maybe you just found
[17:09.890 --> 17:14.210]  the next famous strain that's going to help everybody with a certain ailment.
[17:14.210 --> 17:17.490]  Maybe everybody with cancer smokes your strain and they feel like they can fly.
[17:17.490 --> 17:22.530]  Wouldn't it be amazing to find a strain that made everybody with cancer feel better?
[17:22.530 --> 17:24.310]  That's the magic of growing from seed.
[17:24.310 --> 17:28.130]  You get to find out, did I just grow crap or am I growing magic that's going to make
[17:28.130 --> 17:32.570]  a difference on the planet, a difference for people, a difference for the community, a
[17:32.570 --> 17:35.930]  difference for the whole reputation of cannabis, maybe a difference for science.
[17:35.930 --> 17:39.730]  Maybe they find your strain and they go, man, that thing's got a cannabinoid or a terpene
[17:39.730 --> 17:43.930]  in there or a combo of those things with esters and palates that we've never seen.
[17:43.930 --> 17:46.650]  When people smoke it, they actually fucking levitate.
[17:46.650 --> 17:51.370]  Maybe you found something amazing in there or maybe you got a crap seed that you got
[17:51.370 --> 17:52.370]  to throw away.
[17:52.370 --> 17:53.370]  That's part of the gamble.
[17:53.370 --> 17:54.450]  That's part of the fun.
[17:54.450 --> 17:55.890]  That's part of the passion with seeds.
[17:55.890 --> 17:57.570]  That's why I love growing from seed.
[17:57.570 --> 18:00.430]  You never know what's going to come out of there.
[18:00.430 --> 18:01.430]  You have an idea.
[18:01.430 --> 18:03.450]  I hope you have an idea, especially when you're running MySeeds.
[18:03.450 --> 18:08.410]  I think that MySeeds are quite predictable, but there's variation in that.
[18:08.410 --> 18:09.410]  Variation is what I love.
[18:09.410 --> 18:13.510]  Those outliers that you discover, those anomalies, those mutants, those freak shows, those weirdos
[18:13.510 --> 18:18.090]  that come out of the pack that everything looked like this and it had this certain shape,
[18:18.090 --> 18:22.350]  this certain color, this certain aroma, and then there was this one, just this one.
[18:22.350 --> 18:25.190]  That's the one that's always so amazing to find.
[18:25.190 --> 18:26.250]  Don't throw away those seeds.
[18:26.250 --> 18:27.250]  Grow them.
[18:27.250 --> 18:28.750]  Don't discredit them already.
[18:28.750 --> 18:31.510]  Maybe I should say don't judge a book by its cover.
[18:31.510 --> 18:35.510]  Don't judge a seed by its shell.
[18:35.510 --> 18:36.510]  Grow it out.
[18:36.510 --> 18:41.750]  Take good note and then remember that and then decide your future moves with that breeder
[18:41.750 --> 18:44.350]  based on your experience with those seeds.
[18:44.350 --> 18:49.390]  Please don't judge that breeder or his product or your future purchases from that breeder
[18:49.390 --> 18:53.510]  and future interactions based on seeds you have not germinated yet because what if you
[18:53.510 --> 18:55.650]  grow them and they are fire?
[18:55.650 --> 18:58.110]  What if you talk shit about these seeds because they don't look good?
[18:58.110 --> 19:02.630]  You go on a forum and you're like, Breeder 5000 sold me ... Sorry Breeder 5000 if you're
[19:02.630 --> 19:03.630]  real.
[19:03.630 --> 19:04.630]  I just made up a name.
[19:04.630 --> 19:07.630]  Breeder 5000 sold me some seeds and they're all pale colored and they look like shit and
[19:07.630 --> 19:11.470]  you don't grow them, but what if five other people grow them and they're like, dude, Breeder
[19:11.470 --> 19:14.830]  5000 sold me the most amazing seeds ever.
[19:14.830 --> 19:15.830]  Then you're the asshole.
[19:15.830 --> 19:16.830]  You got to grow them.
[19:16.830 --> 19:19.710]  You got to figure out if they're good or if they're not.
[19:19.710 --> 19:21.670]  Big shout out to Breeder 5000.
[19:21.670 --> 19:22.750]  All right.
[19:22.750 --> 19:25.230]  I think that covers that one right there.
[19:25.230 --> 19:26.790]  They don't look close to the same color.
[19:26.790 --> 19:30.110]  Are there chances of getting a viable plant if they germinate?
[19:30.110 --> 19:32.050]  If they germinate, you've got a viable plant.
[19:32.050 --> 19:35.630]  In my eye, once they pop and a little tail starts coming out and it's growing, that's
[19:35.630 --> 19:36.630]  a viable plant.
[19:36.630 --> 19:40.070]  It's up to you to keep it alive and bring it to fruition and finish it.
[19:40.070 --> 19:42.310]  So yeah, that's the way to find out.
[19:42.310 --> 19:43.910]  Bottom line, grow it.
[19:43.910 --> 19:44.910]  See what it does.
[19:44.910 --> 19:45.910]  All right.
[19:45.990 --> 19:46.990]  I'm going to send you a message.
[19:46.990 --> 19:47.990]  I do apologize.
[19:47.990 --> 19:50.030]  If you wanted a shout out, I did not copy down your name.
[19:50.030 --> 19:51.310]  I kind of feel bad for that.
[19:51.310 --> 19:54.910]  If you want a shout out, send me a message and say, hey, you read my email on the show
[19:54.910 --> 19:59.310]  and you did not give me a shout out and I'll make sure to give you a special shout out.
[19:59.310 --> 20:01.630]  One of these parts of the show, like right here, I'll just be like, big shout out to
[20:01.630 --> 20:03.070]  my friend who I forgot your name.
[20:03.070 --> 20:04.070]  Yeah, we'll do that for you.
[20:04.070 --> 20:05.070]  All right.
[20:05.070 --> 20:07.030]  You guys, that dab is not wearing off.
[20:07.030 --> 20:08.030]  It is still cooking.
[20:08.030 --> 20:09.390]  I got the dab sweats going on.
[20:09.390 --> 20:10.590]  I don't know if you could see it.
[20:10.590 --> 20:12.870]  I got the ADD and the rambles.
[20:12.870 --> 20:13.870]  Highly recommended.
[20:13.870 --> 20:15.150]  10 out of 10 would do it again.
[20:15.390 --> 20:16.390]  All right.
[20:16.390 --> 20:17.390]  I've got another message here in front of me.
[20:17.390 --> 20:19.870]  This one comes from B Bala.
[20:19.870 --> 20:20.870]  What up B Bala?
[20:20.870 --> 20:23.790]  We've been corresponding a little bit on the Patreon.
[20:23.790 --> 20:24.790]  Good supporter.
[20:24.790 --> 20:26.510]  I see a lot of your comments on the YouTube.
[20:26.510 --> 20:29.470]  By the way, people ask why I don't respond to a lot of the YouTube comments.
[20:29.470 --> 20:34.750]  I try not to see the YouTube comments because that's where all of the garbage is.
[20:34.750 --> 20:38.150]  I've noticed that my Discord is all positivity and love.
[20:38.150 --> 20:41.590]  Patreon is all positivity and love because of course you pay a couple of bucks to be
[20:41.590 --> 20:42.590]  there.
[20:42.590 --> 20:44.870]  YouTube is where the negative comments reside.
[20:45.590 --> 20:46.590]  I just dodge that.
[20:46.590 --> 20:51.630]  That's the best way to not see some bullshit, not get sucked in, not get dragged down.
[20:51.630 --> 20:52.630]  Just avoid the shit.
[20:52.630 --> 20:57.090]  If I don't go scrolling looking for trouble, I don't find it because I could be in a totally
[20:57.090 --> 21:00.670]  good mood and then scroll across some shitty ass YouTube comment that some troll left and
[21:00.670 --> 21:02.190]  it could change my attitude.
[21:02.190 --> 21:06.870]  I don't need to give anybody, especially some anonymous fucking troll behind a keyboard.
[21:06.870 --> 21:09.350]  They don't need that power to change my day.
[21:09.350 --> 21:10.910]  I kind of avoid the YouTube comments.
[21:10.910 --> 21:15.430]  If I'm super bored or I actually get email notifications sometimes when I don't check
[21:15.430 --> 21:19.030]  those for very often, YouTube's like, hey, you have a lot of comments you should read.
[21:19.030 --> 21:20.590]  Then I'll go give it a scan.
[21:20.590 --> 21:22.150]  But I try to stay out of there.
[21:22.150 --> 21:25.690]  So if you're sending me messages and questions and stuff on YouTube, that's why I haven't
[21:25.690 --> 21:26.690]  replied to them.
[21:26.690 --> 21:27.690]  I do apologize.
[21:27.690 --> 21:30.830]  But I have seen B-Balla leaving comments on almost every episode.
[21:30.830 --> 21:32.570]  Big up and much respect for that.
[21:32.570 --> 21:33.910]  Let me get myself back on track.
[21:33.910 --> 21:37.830]  Let me find some sort of a point to this madness and we will read your question.
[21:37.830 --> 21:40.110]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff.
[21:40.310 --> 21:41.310]  How's it going?
[21:41.310 --> 21:42.310]  I'm doing good, bro.
[21:42.310 --> 21:46.630]  I'm stoned to shit and smoke some machine dabs and I am the machine, I guess.
[21:46.630 --> 21:47.870]  It says, I had a question for you.
[21:47.870 --> 21:51.110]  I was wondering if you could give me advice on supporting buds.
[21:51.110 --> 21:53.470]  Toward the end of flowering, you should always support your buds.
[21:53.470 --> 21:54.830]  If they need your love, support.
[21:54.830 --> 21:58.190]  If they just need someone to talk to, if they're having problems at home, problems at work,
[21:58.190 --> 22:01.290]  problems with their girlfriend, always be there for your buds.
[22:01.290 --> 22:02.290]  That's very important.
[22:02.290 --> 22:05.110]  Then it also says, I'm toward the end of flowering.
[22:05.110 --> 22:08.570]  I'm about to set up an eight by eight tent and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going
[22:08.570 --> 22:09.630]  to support these buds.
[22:09.650 --> 22:10.750]  You guys know I'm joking, right?
[22:10.750 --> 22:14.670]  You know that he's trying to figure out how to support his tall nuggets, his colas, his
[22:14.670 --> 22:15.670]  buds.
[22:15.670 --> 22:16.670]  All right.
[22:16.670 --> 22:21.190]  It says, I use a trellis net, but I don't like how it limits my ability to enter the
[22:21.190 --> 22:22.990]  tent unless I'm crouched down.
[22:22.990 --> 22:25.670]  I'm six foot four, so that's not really an option.
[22:25.670 --> 22:26.990]  Bro, I know that option.
[22:26.990 --> 22:27.990]  Trust me.
[22:27.990 --> 22:29.670]  Then it says, thanks, bro.
[22:29.670 --> 22:30.790]  I love your show.
[22:30.790 --> 22:34.190]  Keep up the good work because I learn so much.
[22:34.190 --> 22:35.190]  That means a lot to me.
[22:35.190 --> 22:38.070]  I love knowing that people are learning a lot from the podcast.
[22:38.070 --> 22:42.430]  Let's talk about a couple of options to help you keep these buds upright.
[22:42.430 --> 22:45.630]  Our friend's growing some plants and if he has the success he expects, he's going to
[22:45.630 --> 22:47.350]  have some tall nuggets.
[22:47.350 --> 22:50.270]  He's in a tent, so he doesn't have a lot of workspace.
[22:50.270 --> 22:54.110]  Most of the time I would recommend a trellis setting in a five by five tent.
[22:54.110 --> 22:55.790]  They sell a perfect five by five net.
[22:55.790 --> 23:00.670]  It fits beautifully in the tent, but I understand it is a pain in the ass to work around that
[23:00.670 --> 23:02.350]  trellis.
[23:02.350 --> 23:05.390]  Part of me wants to say, we're not there for comfort.
[23:05.390 --> 23:06.750]  We're not there for a party.
[23:06.750 --> 23:08.230]  That is a grow space.
[23:08.230 --> 23:09.230]  Optimize it for the plants.
[23:09.230 --> 23:11.590]  Put up the trellis and adjust.
[23:11.590 --> 23:14.870]  Sometimes I'll set up a trellis in a five by five tent and honestly get down on my hands
[23:14.870 --> 23:17.470]  and knees and do the part below the net.
[23:17.470 --> 23:19.630]  Do any work that needs to be done down there.
[23:19.630 --> 23:23.430]  Defoliating, lollipopping, that's probably done before the net went up.
[23:23.430 --> 23:25.750]  But get down on my hands and knees, do all that work.
[23:25.750 --> 23:29.470]  Pull the leaves out of the pots, anything that fell, anything that needs to be done.
[23:29.470 --> 23:30.950]  I'll just get on my hands and knees and do it.
[23:30.950 --> 23:31.950]  It's work.
[23:31.950 --> 23:35.630]  I'm not in there to watch cartoons and have a good time and smoke bowls and take dabs.
[23:35.630 --> 23:36.630]  That's after work.
[23:36.630 --> 23:37.630]  I'm doing work.
[23:37.630 --> 23:41.190]  So it doesn't bother me to get on my hands and knees and do some work.
[23:41.190 --> 23:42.310]  Edit that however you'd like.
[23:42.310 --> 23:43.310]  Make fun of me for that one.
[23:43.310 --> 23:44.590]  There's a lot of opportunity there.
[23:44.590 --> 23:49.230]  But it doesn't bother me to get dirty, get in there, crouch down, get sweaty, hurt my
[23:49.230 --> 23:52.150]  back, hurt my neck, hurt my knees, get some work done.
[23:52.150 --> 23:53.910]  That's what work is to me.
[23:53.910 --> 23:57.030]  Then when I'm done with that, I'll go take dabs and not be crouched down and enjoy it.
[23:57.030 --> 23:58.390]  It's only an hour at the most.
[23:58.390 --> 23:59.390]  It's a five by five tent.
[23:59.390 --> 24:01.830]  You're not going to be on your knees for more than an hour or two in there, crouched down,
[24:01.830 --> 24:02.830]  getting shit done.
[24:02.830 --> 24:06.390]  You can get a five gallon bucket or a drum stool is what I use and do everything above
[24:06.390 --> 24:08.510]  the net while you're sitting down comfortably.
[24:08.510 --> 24:09.710]  That'll make up for it.
[24:09.710 --> 24:15.050]  So that is my first answer is to just suck it up, do the net, crouch down.
[24:15.050 --> 24:18.990]  If you're six foot four, from the edge of that tent, if you're on your knees, you can
[24:18.990 --> 24:23.450]  reach the center and you can reach, if you can walk around just the two or three sides
[24:23.450 --> 24:25.910]  that unzip, you can reach everything inside of that tent.
[24:25.910 --> 24:26.910]  I've got a five by five.
[24:26.910 --> 24:27.910]  I'm six foot five.
[24:27.910 --> 24:29.950]  I've got a six foot wingspan here.
[24:29.950 --> 24:31.670]  We can reach all the way into that tent.
[24:31.670 --> 24:36.110]  So the first, yeah, I hate to tell you, but just suck it up and crouch down and do it,
[24:36.110 --> 24:37.110]  bro.
[24:37.110 --> 24:38.110]  That is the easiest way to do it.
[24:38.110 --> 24:40.350]  I use two, maybe three layers of trellis netting.
[24:40.350 --> 24:42.630]  I'll use the first layer to spread them out.
[24:42.630 --> 24:47.050]  Then the second layer to kind of guide them and give them a spread, just show the buds
[24:47.050 --> 24:48.050]  which way to go.
[24:48.050 --> 24:49.390]  Direction is the word I'm looking for.
[24:49.390 --> 24:52.270]  Then the third one is actually to support the, the colas.
[24:52.270 --> 24:54.130]  That's to hold all those big buds.
[24:54.130 --> 24:55.950]  So I'll do three trellises in there and you're right.
[24:55.950 --> 24:57.450]  At that point, the plants are stuck.
[24:57.450 --> 24:58.630]  You can't move them.
[24:58.630 --> 25:02.510]  If you want to work with them, you're crawling on your hands and knees to get in there, but
[25:02.510 --> 25:03.510]  it's work.
[25:03.510 --> 25:04.750]  It's not, I keep saying that it's work.
[25:04.750 --> 25:06.430]  It's not, we're not in there to have a good time.
[25:06.430 --> 25:07.430]  Work hurts.
[25:07.430 --> 25:08.430]  Work sucks.
[25:08.430 --> 25:09.430]  Work is dirty.
[25:09.430 --> 25:10.430]  Work is work.
[25:10.430 --> 25:11.710]  That's why we have play when we're done.
[25:11.710 --> 25:12.750]  That's why you get paid for it.
[25:12.750 --> 25:13.750]  That's why there are rewards.
[25:13.750 --> 25:14.950]  That's why there's a difference.
[25:14.950 --> 25:19.110]  So I'm sure you understand that part, but part of me is just saying, suck it up, bro.
[25:19.110 --> 25:20.830]  Crawl down on your hands and knees and get in there.
[25:20.830 --> 25:25.870]  My next option is have you considered adding an auto watering system?
[25:25.870 --> 25:30.030]  If you've got that trellis in place, put the auto watering system in there, put the
[25:30.030 --> 25:32.390]  trellis in place, then you don't have to crawl around to water.
[25:32.390 --> 25:34.870]  You don't have to do as much work on your hands and knees.
[25:34.870 --> 25:37.230]  If you've got the auto watering system, I can press a button.
[25:37.230 --> 25:39.710]  It turns on a pump that pump tells the water to go.
[25:39.710 --> 25:43.790]  The water goes, I watched the plants or put it on a timer and I know that it spits out
[25:43.790 --> 25:44.990]  this many gallons per minute.
[25:44.990 --> 25:46.750]  My plants are getting that much water.
[25:46.750 --> 25:47.750]  Let it run.
[25:47.750 --> 25:49.390]  I don't even have to get on my hands and knees and get down there.
[25:49.390 --> 25:52.990]  As long as all those watering emitters worked, everything went well.
[25:52.990 --> 25:54.390]  That's less crawling around to do.
[25:55.070 --> 25:56.070]  That is another option.
[25:56.070 --> 25:59.230]  I would say set up the trellis nets and do an auto watering system.
[25:59.230 --> 26:04.190]  That's a little bit of work up front, but that saves you so much work on the back end.
[26:04.190 --> 26:08.230]  Small investment, couple of hours, that'll save you so much work in the long run, so
[26:08.230 --> 26:11.390]  much climbing around, so much time on your hands and knees.
[26:11.390 --> 26:15.270]  Also, if you have to go out of town for a couple of days or maybe you got company and
[26:15.270 --> 26:18.710]  she can't know you got to grow in the morning and you're like, oh shit, the lights are on.
[26:18.710 --> 26:20.630]  I really need to go water those plants.
[26:20.630 --> 26:23.870]  You could just relax because that auto watering system came on right at the same time as the
[26:23.870 --> 26:25.550]  lights and it watered for you.
[26:25.550 --> 26:28.190]  She has no idea you got to grow.
[26:28.190 --> 26:31.270]  That auto watering system could come in advantageous.
[26:31.270 --> 26:33.950]  Then if you don't want to do that because I understand that you're trying to get away
[26:33.950 --> 26:36.870]  from the net, the next option is sticks.
[26:36.870 --> 26:41.150]  Those bamboo sticks or those green plastic sticks that they sell at most grow shops,
[26:41.150 --> 26:43.870]  those are always ideal for supporting the buds.
[26:43.870 --> 26:47.630]  You can stick a stick in the soil or the medium, the cocoa, whatever you're working, it'll
[26:47.630 --> 26:48.630]  stick up.
[26:48.630 --> 26:52.670]  You could put it at an angle and then just affix your bud with either ... I like to use
[26:52.790 --> 26:53.790]  the little fuzzy sticks.
[26:53.790 --> 26:54.790]  They're like pipe cleaners.
[26:54.790 --> 26:55.950]  They're really affordable.
[26:55.950 --> 26:59.670]  They sell a lot of different options and a lot of different things at the grow store.
[26:59.670 --> 27:05.750]  Just like a rubber coated wire or just a wire or a bread tie, a twisty tie.
[27:05.750 --> 27:09.910]  Anything you can just affix and attach those colas to that stick with would work.
[27:09.910 --> 27:13.230]  Just move it the way you want it and just wrap it right up.
[27:13.230 --> 27:14.230]  Kind of low.
[27:14.230 --> 27:16.530]  Go lower than you need to with the zip tie and don't go too tight.
[27:16.530 --> 27:17.630]  Don't choke the bud.
[27:17.630 --> 27:18.970]  Don't choke the stem.
[27:18.970 --> 27:20.550]  Just give it a little seat belt.
[27:20.550 --> 27:22.990]  Just attach it to that stick.
[27:22.990 --> 27:25.750]  Then you can put as many sticks as you want in there and spread that plant out the way
[27:25.750 --> 27:28.990]  that you need it and shape it the way you want it by using those sticks.
[27:28.990 --> 27:30.410]  That's really helpful.
[27:30.410 --> 27:34.990]  One thing I'm going to mention, those sticks are fucking dangerous.
[27:34.990 --> 27:36.690]  Make sure you protect your eyes.
[27:36.690 --> 27:38.790]  Maybe put something on the end of the sticks.
[27:38.790 --> 27:41.110]  Put a little duct tape flag so you remember it's there.
[27:41.110 --> 27:44.990]  Put a little ball of duct tape on it so that when you lean down to water your pots, you
[27:44.990 --> 27:46.710]  don't get that stick in your eye.
[27:46.710 --> 27:47.710]  I've done it.
[27:47.710 --> 27:48.710]  I've seen it happen.
[27:48.870 --> 27:52.790]  Luckily, you'll be leaning down and you'll see that stick just as it enters your eye.
[27:52.790 --> 27:56.270]  You'll go, shit, a stick, but your body is already moving, but you'll trigger up and
[27:56.270 --> 27:57.830]  it'll just touch your eyeball.
[27:57.830 --> 28:01.950]  When I did it, it just touched my eye and I jumped up like, oh shit, it touched my eye.
[28:01.950 --> 28:04.950]  Probably should have gone to the doctor because there's probably some pesticides or some bullshit
[28:04.950 --> 28:07.870]  on there, but I'm a stubborn guy and I thought I got to keep working.
[28:07.870 --> 28:09.070]  I just kept doing my shit.
[28:09.070 --> 28:14.350]  But be very, very careful of those sticks if you do use them, especially the green sticks
[28:14.350 --> 28:15.990]  because they blend in with your plants.
[28:15.990 --> 28:16.990]  You don't even fucking see them.
[28:16.990 --> 28:18.230]  You forget they're there.
[28:18.270 --> 28:20.550]  You get busy, you'll poke yourself in the eye.
[28:20.550 --> 28:23.950]  That's why I prefer the trellis, but the sticks keep the plants independent.
[28:23.950 --> 28:25.550]  They allow you to work a little bit better.
[28:25.550 --> 28:26.550]  I get it.
[28:26.550 --> 28:27.950]  So the sticks are always there.
[28:27.950 --> 28:30.030]  Another great option is tomato cages.
[28:30.030 --> 28:35.950]  You can buy a tomato cage at most of your big or small hardware stores, especially around
[28:35.950 --> 28:36.950]  the growth season.
[28:36.950 --> 28:40.990]  If your local hardware store or local nursery or garden supply store doesn't have them,
[28:40.990 --> 28:42.590]  you can always order them on Amazon.
[28:42.590 --> 28:44.810]  They'll show up at the front door.
[28:44.810 --> 28:46.270]  Tomato cages are very useful.
[28:46.270 --> 28:51.310]  They're just a circle, a wire circle with three or four, what is it, vertical posts
[28:51.310 --> 28:53.910]  to keep them together so your circles are horizontal.
[28:53.910 --> 28:57.350]  You got three or four vertical posts to stick those into the dirt.
[28:57.350 --> 28:58.350]  They taper.
[28:58.350 --> 29:01.110]  They get bigger at the top and skinnier at the bottom.
[29:01.110 --> 29:02.670]  I've seen people do it both ways.
[29:02.670 --> 29:06.550]  I've seen them flipped over and have the skinnier ring up top and I've seen people with the
[29:06.550 --> 29:07.910]  bigger ring up top.
[29:07.910 --> 29:11.550]  I prefer the big ring up top because then I can spread the plant out and I've got a
[29:11.550 --> 29:15.750]  big circle that I can use the bread ties or the zip ties.
[29:15.750 --> 29:20.790]  I can pull my plant out and attach it to the outside ring of that tomato cage.
[29:20.790 --> 29:22.790]  Then my top is going up right up the middle.
[29:22.790 --> 29:24.810]  My outer buds are all spread out.
[29:24.810 --> 29:26.190]  Big nice bushy plant.
[29:26.190 --> 29:29.550]  I usually do a seven gallon pot with a tomato cage.
[29:29.550 --> 29:30.550]  Top the plant twice.
[29:30.550 --> 29:31.830]  Get it huge and bushy.
[29:31.830 --> 29:34.790]  I like to fit about four of those under a thousand watt light.
[29:34.790 --> 29:36.250]  That's always a fun game.
[29:36.250 --> 29:40.470]  My three recommendations would be to stick with that trellis and just learn to work around
[29:40.470 --> 29:43.750]  it, which I know isn't ideal and it sucks having some dude tell you just suck it up
[29:43.750 --> 29:47.270]  and work around it and hurt your back occasionally, but that's what I would do.
[29:47.270 --> 29:48.270]  That is what I do.
[29:48.270 --> 29:49.430]  I'm six foot five.
[29:49.430 --> 29:50.790]  I definitely feel your struggle.
[29:50.790 --> 29:52.150]  I hit my head on lights all the time.
[29:52.150 --> 29:53.630]  I bonk my head on shit.
[29:53.630 --> 29:55.630]  I got these big dreadlocks in the way.
[29:55.630 --> 29:59.430]  It's awkward working around things, maneuvering in, but it's work.
[29:59.430 --> 30:01.270]  That's what we're getting paid for.
[30:01.270 --> 30:04.830]  You got to put some blood, sweat, and tears into that shit, but if that's not an option,
[30:04.830 --> 30:05.830]  I totally understand.
[30:05.830 --> 30:08.930]  I'm not going to tell you to get in there and break your back if you don't want to.
[30:08.930 --> 30:12.650]  That's when I would recommend either sticks or tomato cages.
[30:12.650 --> 30:14.210]  Both are cost effective.
[30:14.210 --> 30:18.770]  Both keep the plants independent where the plants are movable, and then also you can
[30:18.770 --> 30:22.290]  get in there and work with them because you don't have to crawl around under that trellis.
[30:22.290 --> 30:26.010]  Although I do think you'll find great results with the trellis once you get comfortable
[30:26.010 --> 30:27.010]  with it.
[30:27.010 --> 30:32.730]  I've had my best harvest weights, best potency, most impressive grows have always been things
[30:32.730 --> 30:33.730]  that I've trellised out.
[30:33.730 --> 30:36.330]  All right, B-Bala, I hope I gave you some useful advice.
[30:36.330 --> 30:39.490]  I know I started off by telling you just to suck it up and crawl in there and do some
[30:39.490 --> 30:41.490]  work.
[30:41.490 --> 30:43.090]  That's honestly my straight up answer.
[30:43.090 --> 30:44.490]  That's what I would tell anybody at the grow.
[30:44.490 --> 30:46.530]  If somebody was like, but boss, I have to crawl down there.
[30:46.530 --> 30:47.850]  I'd be like, well, you're on the clock.
[30:47.850 --> 30:49.810]  You can fucking crawl down there, buddy.
[30:49.810 --> 30:51.090]  What are we paying you for?
[30:51.090 --> 30:52.090]  I would do it too.
[30:52.090 --> 30:54.810]  I wouldn't just tell somebody to do some shit that I wouldn't do.
[30:54.810 --> 30:56.210]  That's how I do it.
[30:56.210 --> 30:57.450]  I hope I answered your question.
[30:57.450 --> 31:00.690]  I hope I gave you some useful advice here.
[31:00.690 --> 31:02.890]  If you want to send me some pictures, ask me more questions.
