[00:00.890 --> 00:22.300]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 76 of the grow from
[00:22.300 --> 00:26.740]  your heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.740 --> 00:30.260]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.260 --> 00:33.640]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.380]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:38.380 --> 00:41.860]  host Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me as always. I need to send a huge thank
[00:41.860 --> 00:44.980]  you shout out to the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on the show. Big
[00:44.980 --> 00:49.140]  thanks to Kat Coop and the entire mystic roots crew. Of course, the song you're listening
[00:49.140 --> 00:53.020]  to is the doggy dub and it's off their album, the constant struggle. Make sure you check
[00:53.020 --> 00:58.300]  that out and support the mystic roots band and stay positive sound. All right guys, I'll
[00:58.300 --> 01:01.820]  let you know that while I'm recording the podcast today, I am live on a new application
[01:01.820 --> 01:07.340]  called Periscope. Uh, people on Periscope are watching me live. I've got five live viewers.
[01:07.340 --> 01:10.380]  I'm recording. They can hear everything I'm saying. They could not hear the pod or the
[01:10.380 --> 01:14.420]  theme song, but they could hear everything else. Uh, they're able to send comments that
[01:14.420 --> 01:18.660]  I can see on the bottom of the screen. Uh, I'm not going to pay attention to the comments
[01:18.660 --> 01:24.780]  on Periscope while I record the podcast today, but if this goes well in a future episode,
[01:24.780 --> 01:29.140]  this may open up the doors for a questions and answer segment. Uh, you'll be able to
[01:29.140 --> 01:33.860]  answer questions. I will answer them live on Periscope as I record the podcast. And
[01:33.860 --> 01:37.420]  then in the future, uh, it won't be any more than I'll do it. I'll try to get it up as
[01:37.420 --> 01:41.280]  quickly as possible. Right after the live Q and a, I'll go ahead and throw the podcast
[01:41.280 --> 01:45.740]  up into iTunes and stitcher. And then you guys can listen to it again. If you didn't
[01:45.740 --> 01:50.840]  already, uh, if you listen to it on the fucking, uh, Periscope app, and if you didn't already
[01:50.840 --> 01:54.220]  listen to it, then you'll be able to hear the actual episode with questions from the
[01:54.220 --> 01:57.740]  listeners. So we're going to figure out how to do that. You guys check out this Periscope
[01:57.740 --> 02:03.940]  app. It's pretty neat. Um, you can log in and you can watch people broadcast their lives
[02:03.940 --> 02:07.540]  or you can broadcast your life. If you'd feel like it, it's kind of neat. I've been
[02:07.540 --> 02:10.420]  going in the grow room and walking around in the garden and showing people what I've
[02:10.420 --> 02:14.980]  got going on in the garden. Uh, I've been driving around and throwing the phone up on
[02:14.980 --> 02:19.700]  the dashboard just while I drive around. It's been pretty neat. So let's move on a little
[02:19.700 --> 02:25.140]  bit in this show. You guys, I do plan on talking about, uh, Fino hunting and selecting mother
[02:25.140 --> 02:28.020]  plants. I know I've been teasing about Fino hunting a little bit. We're going to do that
[02:28.020 --> 02:32.880]  in this episode. Uh, before we get that far though, I do want to send a big happy birthday
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.280]  shout out to Maya Luna. Happy birthday, monkey bear. That's my daughter. She is now 12 years
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.440]  old. Uh, this episode will come out on the 14th late, late at night on the 14th. You
[02:41.440 --> 02:45.120]  guys will hopefully listen to it on the morning of the 15th. I'm going to drop it late on
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.880]  the 14th just to say happy birthday to my daughter. Happy birthday, Maya Luna. Your
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.880]  daddy loves you. I'm not sure if you listen to the podcast. I'm pretty sure you're tired
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.800]  of hearing my voice. So, uh, maybe one day when you're old and you listen back to all
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.400]  the episodes, you'll catch this one and it'll put a smile on your face. Dad's think about
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.360]  that kind of shit. All right. So happy birthday, Maya bear. I love you so much more than anything.
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.080]  Uh, let's keep the show moving. Dude. A couple of nights ago, my good buddy Clint got me
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.040]  a ticket. Uh, I drove, we took along, uh, Clint's little brother, Chris. And then we
[03:15.040 --> 03:18.640]  met up with our good buddy, Joe, who will be on a future episode of the podcast. We've
[03:18.640 --> 03:24.720]  talked about that. Uh, but we went up to Denver to comedy works and we saw Joey Coco Diaz
[03:24.720 --> 03:30.720]  and that motherfucker blew the roof off of comedy works. That dude ripped it up. That's
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.880]  one of the best comedy shows I've seen in quite a while. I know I say that about every
[03:34.880 --> 03:39.280]  comedy show when I come on this show, but it was one of the best shows I've seen in
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.400]  quite a long time. It totally kicked ass, uh, for the first six or seven minutes of
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.960]  the show. Uh, he came out and he told a joke, right? And he kept telling jokes, but he told
[03:48.960 --> 03:52.720]  it, it was like, he hit me and then I would start laughing. And as soon as I felt like
[03:52.720 --> 03:55.920]  I was going to catch my breath, he'd hit me harder. So I'd laugh even harder and lose
[03:55.920 --> 03:59.680]  my breath. And every time I feel like I was coming around, he'd hit me. And I was starting
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.360]  to get a pleasant pain in my cheeks and stomach from laughing so hard. And then I got this
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.200]  weird headache toward the back of my head from laughing so fucking hard. I was like,
[04:09.200 --> 04:13.600]  Joey, stop for a minute, bro. I need a little bit of oxygen because I cannot breathe and
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.600]  I cannot keep up with this. I'm moving the Periscope camera right now so that they can
[04:17.600 --> 04:19.920]  see me a little bit better. I think I've got everything I need on the screen.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.160]  So, uh, Joey Coco Diaz is definitely one of my favorite comedians. Joe Rogan says he's
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.840]  the best comedian on the planet right now. I could almost agree with that. If you're
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.000]  into that style, I can listen to Joey talk all day. I listened to his podcast, the church
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.800]  of what's happening now and it's fucking awesome. So big shout out to Joey Coco Diaz for putting
[04:38.800 --> 04:44.000]  on an amazing fucking comedy show at comedy works in downtown Denver. Also big shout out
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.640]  to Baker and the entire comedy works crew Baker. I owe you one, bro. If you ever need
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.400]  anything, if you're ever in Pueblo, make sure you get in touch with me. I will hook you up with any
[04:52.400 --> 04:57.440]  help you need. Comedy works. I love that club. I've said it once or seven times, the best
[04:57.440 --> 05:02.640]  fucking comedy club in Colorado, possibly the world. Also, I want to send a huge shout out to
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.840]  Clint for the ticket and for being a hell of a good friend, dude. Uh, you're my homie forever
[05:07.840 --> 05:10.800]  and I appreciate it and I see what you do and you're a good friend, dude. And I just want to
[05:10.800 --> 05:14.080]  throw that out there. We hung out today, had a great time. I know you're always going to be my
[05:15.040 --> 05:21.040]  friend. I appreciate that shit. Uh, also shout out to Joe and Chris, uh, man, we, and we killed
[05:21.040 --> 05:26.800]  it as a group at that show. Nobody was a bitch. Nobody whined about anything. Uh, Joe met us up
[05:26.800 --> 05:31.600]  in Denver, Chris and Clint and I all rode up together. Nobody was a little whiny girl. We
[05:31.600 --> 05:35.280]  had so much fun. We had a successful dinner. We flirted with the beautiful waitress at the
[05:35.280 --> 05:40.640]  mellow mushroom. Uh, we kicked ass at the show. We all met Joey Diaz. We all had a nice little
[05:40.640 --> 05:45.280]  smoke out in the car before and after such a great time. So shout out to the crew for kicking
[05:45.280 --> 05:48.880]  it. You guys are not painting the asses. You were professionals. You were grown men and I fucking
[05:48.880 --> 05:53.360]  love hanging out with you guys. Let's do it more often. All right. You guys were all invited on the
[05:53.360 --> 05:58.240]  podcast whenever you'd like to be. So I wrote a note and I lost it. Shit. I got to reach for a
[05:58.240 --> 06:06.440]  note. It's right over here. Hold on you guys. Okay. I've got my note. Uh, I wrote down to give
[06:06.440 --> 06:11.960]  a shout out to a guy who calls himself beast of Omaha, big shout out to the beast of Omaha.
[06:12.440 --> 06:16.360]  He follows me on Periscope and we were talking earlier, told him that I do a podcast. He said
[06:16.360 --> 06:20.520]  he was going to check it out. This is the episode I did right after we spoke, bro. So I hope you
[06:20.520 --> 06:25.160]  were listening. I hope you check this out. All right. We're going to keep the show moving. We
[06:25.160 --> 06:30.200]  are going to get onto the main topic of the show. The main topic of the show, you guys is going to
[06:30.200 --> 06:35.720]  be Fino hunting and selecting mother plants. I didn't take a lot of notes because I feel like I
[06:35.720 --> 06:39.960]  can pull that episode off without a lot of preparation. I mean, I've got all the preparation
[06:39.960 --> 06:45.640]  in my head. I've done this a thousand times, so I think I can pull it off, but let's see. I got one
[06:45.640 --> 06:49.400]  or two more things I want to talk about where my notes are. We are. Uh, I want to announce
[06:49.400 --> 06:54.760]  something. This one is going to be really, really cool. So a very long time ago, I was scrolling
[06:54.760 --> 06:58.760]  through Instagram. I'm sorry about the clearing of the throat. You guys know how that goes to smoke
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.920]  dabs and drink caffeine and then throw it goes to shit. A long time ago, I was scrolling through
[07:02.920 --> 07:09.480]  Instagram and I came across an Instagram page of a lovely lady called dude. It's damsel. And I've
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.400]  been following damsel. She's a suicide girl. She's tattooed up. She's got dreadlocks and she's
[07:13.400 --> 07:18.040]  fucking beautiful. She's an amazing woman. Uh, I've been following damsel on Instagram for quite a
[07:18.040 --> 07:23.000]  while. And then a good friend of mine, our friend hunt, the Grammy Gatsby introduced me to damsel.
[07:23.640 --> 07:28.280]  Uh, and also my friend, Julia, I got to give shouts to Julie. What's up Jules. Miss you boo.
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.200]  Uh, she is partly responsible for introducing me to damsel. So I entered, I got introduced to
[07:34.200 --> 07:40.200]  damsel. We've talked, we've spoken a few times and I am proud to announce that I am working on a
[07:40.200 --> 07:47.080]  strain for dude. It's damsel, the suicide girl. It will be a strain specifically selected for her.
[07:47.720 --> 07:53.720]  And this strain will represent damsel. It will be colorful. It will be sexy. It will stand out from
[07:53.720 --> 07:59.640]  the crowd. It will be something you want to look at. It will smell beautiful. It will taste amazing.
[07:59.720 --> 08:05.400]  And her idea is that when she smokes it, she wants a nice giggly sativa head high.
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.600]  So I'm working on that strain. I've got several, the seeds are ready. Here's, here's where I am.
[08:10.600 --> 08:17.960]  The seeds are ready. And I have several crosses that I think would make damsel happy. But instead
[08:17.960 --> 08:22.600]  of just running one cross, I'm going to run three or four crosses that I've made. And we're going to
[08:22.600 --> 08:30.280]  see if one of those gives us a phenotype that damsel completely loves. So that is a great segue
[08:30.280 --> 08:36.200]  to get into the main meat of this podcast. The main topic of this podcast is pheno hunting and
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.520]  selecting a mother plant for the future. We're definitely going to focus on pheno hunting because
[08:40.520 --> 08:47.480]  I've already gone about 10 minutes. So let me head over to Google here. Sorry about the microphone
[08:47.480 --> 08:51.960]  bumps. Let me head over to Google here. Shout out to damsel. Also, before I get too far, I want to
[08:51.960 --> 08:56.840]  give a huge shout out to damsel. Make sure you guys follow at dudetsdamsel on Instagram and let
[08:56.840 --> 09:05.800]  her know that you support her new strain. Use the hashtag, hashtag damselsdank, D-A-M-S-E-L-S-D-A-N-K,
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.840]  damselsdank. I think I said that right. I'm high. Hashtag damselsdank. Let her know that you follow
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.960]  iReedGenetics. You listen to the podcast, follow her on Instagram. She's beautiful. Support her,
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.160]  watch the progress of the strain that we're working on. I'll start posting pictures soon.
[09:19.960 --> 09:28.920]  So shout out to damsel for giving me the honor to grow a strain that will represent her forever.
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.520]  And also, I want to send a big, huge shout out to my buddy, Hunt. Hey, Hunt, thanks for
[09:33.160 --> 09:36.840]  linking damsel and I up together to get this project started. I'm sure this is going to work
[09:36.840 --> 09:41.160]  out great for everybody. Once this project is completed and damsel has picked her favorite
[09:41.160 --> 09:47.640]  phenotypes or phenotype, the strain should be available for purchase in flower form at
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.600]  Green and Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs and also the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.960]  Colorado. So that'll be a long time coming, but once it's available, we will let you guys know.
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.120]  So to get that far, I'm going to have to do a pheno hunt, which is actually the main topic of
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.040]  this show. Now, it feels like a good place to start would be to define the word phenotype. So
[10:10.040 --> 10:17.560]  I'm headed over to Google and Wikipedia says a phenotype is the set of observable characteristics
[10:17.640 --> 10:23.400]  of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. So kind of
[10:23.400 --> 10:27.560]  what that says is if we have a bunch of seeds and we grow them out and they are all the same
[10:27.560 --> 10:31.160]  genotype, which means they came from the same parents, they're the same batch of seeds.
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.560]  If we grow those out, we will see what is called phenotypical expressions, which means some of
[10:37.560 --> 10:42.360]  those plants are going to show characteristics of its mother. Some are going to show characteristics
[10:42.360 --> 10:46.840]  of its father. Some are going to show characteristics of grandparents that we
[10:46.840 --> 10:52.600]  didn't even see in the parent plants. And then some of them are going to show perfect traits
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.920]  of 50-50 combinations of each. And then we're going to see variations in between,
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.960]  depending on which phenyl generation you're working with. So one way to kind of put that is
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.080]  if you have a brother or sister, you probably don't look exactly alike because you're from
[11:07.800 --> 11:15.800]  the same parents, but you are different phenotypes basically. Maybe your brother is a little taller
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.200]  than you or a little fatter than you or something. That's just phenotypical expression of the same
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.680]  genotype basically. So when we're working with plants, when we're looking for phenotypes,
[11:24.680 --> 11:30.840]  the purpose of a pheno hunt is to find the plant that you want from that 10 pack of seeds.
[11:30.840 --> 11:37.000]  Now you have a couple of decisions to make. Do you want the plant that represents the one
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  that's on the picture of the package of seeds, the one that you read about? Do you want the one
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.520]  that grows a little bit shorter for your grow room? Do you want the one that's a little more
[11:44.520 --> 11:48.760]  Indica dominant, the one that's a little more sativa dominant? That's something to think about
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.120]  when you are starting a pheno hunt. The purpose of the pheno hunt is to run through... See,
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.480]  I would recommend at least 10 seeds as a breeder. I do anywhere from 25 to 100 seeds of the same
[11:59.480 --> 12:06.440]  strain. So the ideal thing is to run as many of these seedlings as you can underneath the same
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.800]  conditions to find the one that you want that is the stellar keeper out of all of the plants that
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.960]  you're working with. A lot of times I see people purchase a package of seeds and they will run
[12:17.960 --> 12:23.240]  two of those seeds and then they'll say, hey, look, I've got sour diesel or hey, look, I've
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.480]  got super lemon haze. And you might have a decent super lemon haze, but you don't have that super
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.320]  phenotype because you haven't gone through and done the work. You haven't pheno hunted out the
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.720]  one that is stellar, that is worth keeping, that's going to blow everybody else's mind.
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.600]  So a pheno hunt is where you're going to find a lot of good shit. And you could have gotten that
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.520]  stellar keeper out of just a couple. But I mean, if you do a large pheno hunt, the chances of
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.960]  finding what you want and that stellar keeper, just it's even better. All right. So let's talk
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.360]  about a couple of really popular phenotypes while we're on this subject, before we get into
[12:56.360 --> 13:02.440]  me explaining how I do my typical pheno hunts. I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about jilly
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.560]  bean. There is a really popular phenotype of jilly bean known as the candy store phenotype.
[13:07.560 --> 13:14.760]  And there's also another phenotype known as the orange phenotype. The candy store phenotype smells
[13:14.760 --> 13:19.880]  like when you walk into the candy store in the mall, it's got that sweet, it's like those candy
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.800]  hearts you buy at Halloween or at Valentine's day. It all smells real sugary and sweet. And it makes
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.960]  you like want to eat candy. That's what the candy store phenotype smells like. That's of course why
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.440]  it's called candy store. The orange phenotype smells like a basket of fucking oranges. It's
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.680]  so delicious. And those are known phenotypes. So when you hear people talking about, yeah,
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.880]  I got the orange phenotype or I got the jilly pheno, that's what they're talking about.
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.680]  I breed a strain called heart of gold and there is the chunky girl phenotype, which just grows
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.200]  big fat phenos. And then there's the mean girl, which looks a little, she's real jagged in the
[13:52.200 --> 13:56.600]  way that her buds grow are real spiky and pointy. So I call her the mean girl just because she looks
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.760]  angry when she grows. It's a really great plant, but it looks like ferocious. It's like an
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.800]  intimidating plant for some reason. And then there's also the other pheno, which is the
[14:05.800 --> 14:09.400]  non-desirable pheno. It's the one that's more golden goat leaning. I don't keep that pheno
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.720]  when I grow heart of gold. I'll toss that one out right away when I identify it. But that's more of
[14:13.720 --> 14:18.760]  an advanced thing. So when you hear us talking about like, I've gotten the whatever pheno,
[14:18.760 --> 14:22.840]  that's what we're saying that we grew out a pack of seeds and we found the pheno that was known,
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.320]  that's been talked about a lot, or that the breeder told you to look for.
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.000]  Like I know that there are phenos of black cherry chem that I tell the guys, my friends, I'm like,
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.040]  if you see that, I wouldn't even keep that one. I would just get rid of that right away.
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.680]  And I'm like, if you see this, that's kind of the one you want to keep. So if you're growing
[14:38.680 --> 14:44.280]  black cherry chem, the one that shows dark, dark purple right away, like a plum purple right away,
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.480]  I don't think that's a keeper. It grows little tiny popcorn balls of bright, dark, dark purple
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.800]  buds. And I don't find that to be a keeper. So as a pheno hunter, I know to throw that away. And I
[14:53.800 --> 14:57.720]  only know that because I've grown it out so many times. I feel like I'm drifting a little bit away
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.960]  from the topic, but it's all useful information here. All right. I should probably get into
[15:01.960 --> 15:08.120]  explaining a little bit how I do a pheno hunt or how I would recommend you doing a pheno hunt as a
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.560]  kind of a new grower without a lot of space and a lot of money to spend on seeds. So the way to do
[15:13.560 --> 15:18.440]  it, I would get a 10 pack of seeds or a 12 pack. If you can get it, some, some folks are selling
[15:18.440 --> 15:21.800]  12s, get about 10 seeds. If you can, 10 is enough. You know, if you want to run a pheno hunt for
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.240]  yourself, 10 is enough seeds. I would get seeds from a reputable company, from a reputable vendor.
[15:28.200 --> 15:35.480]  I would recommend stuff like Gage Green Genetics, Laplata Labs, IRI Genetics, of course. Sin City
[15:35.480 --> 15:40.520]  Seeds has shown me some great shit lately. The Sour Seed Company has a great lineup and a lot
[15:40.520 --> 15:44.600]  of great things to offer. There are a lot of great DNA genetics is somebody who I would recommend.
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.960]  Rare Dankness, somebody who I would recommend. Crockett Family Farms. There are a lot of seed
[15:49.960 --> 15:54.120]  breeders out there. You guys try to do some research, get a reputable brand, give yourself a
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.400]  chance, get some good seeds and give yourself a chance. So get a good 10 pack of seeds, feminized
[15:59.400 --> 16:04.600]  or regulars, that's up to you. So what we're going to do, we're going to germinate all 10 seeds
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.120]  and we're going to treat them all the same. We're going to do everything exactly the same to all 10
[16:10.120 --> 16:15.720]  of these seeds for almost all of their lives until kind of mid flower. If we see that they
[16:15.720 --> 16:22.040]  need more water or more nitrogen or more something in late flower, we'll make a note of that and then
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.760]  we will keep that in mind when we select our keepers in the future. So we're going to germinate
[16:26.760 --> 16:32.360]  10 seeds. We're going to pay attention to them from day one because you just want to keep notes.
[16:32.360 --> 16:37.080]  If you've got a seed that's a straggler, make a note of one that's a straggler. If you can label
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.120]  your seeds somehow, like seed one, seed two, seed three, make a note of that. So germinate these
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.360]  seeds, get them into cups, grow them, take some pictures if you can, about once a week if you can.
[16:47.080 --> 16:51.320]  Then what we want to do is pay attention to them really closely, veg them out a little bit. Then
[16:51.320 --> 16:56.120]  you want to take a clone of them as soon as they're big enough to take clones. So now you've got these
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.120]  little plants that are probably in like one to three gallon pots and you've probably taken a
[17:00.120 --> 17:05.000]  couple of clones off of them hopefully, right? So now you've got a decision to make. Do you want to
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.520]  flower out the original seed that you started or do you want to keep that seedling as a mother plant
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.000]  or do you want to keep one of the clones as a mother and flower out that plant that's already
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.560]  large? It's kind of a toss-up. It depends on how much space you have and what you want to do. What
[17:19.560 --> 17:26.760]  I have learned is I like that seeded, the seedling mother to stay as my mom. For some reason it has
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.800]  more vigor. It seems to be a good idea to keep that one as your mother. That's just my opinion.
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.400]  A lot of people say that that one's already grown and already big. Why not flower it out?
[17:37.400 --> 17:42.040]  Lately from watching clones grow and watching seed plants grow, I prefer to have my mother
[17:42.040 --> 17:47.400]  plant come from seed. That's something I have learned. I may be hypocritical because sometimes
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.720]  time doesn't always allow that. Sometimes I need the space in the room to bloom so I bloom out the
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.960]  large plant that's already going. But from now on I will try to keep that seed plant as my original
[17:57.960 --> 18:03.720]  mother. You got these plants that are big enough to take a clone off of. You take a couple clones
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.280]  and then you decide which one you want to flower. If you're going to flower that original mom,
[18:08.280 --> 18:13.400]  you put all 10 of those original seed moms into a flowering room and you treat them all the exact
[18:13.400 --> 18:17.960]  same and you flower all of them. If you choose to do clones, all you have to do is get the clones
[18:17.960 --> 18:22.120]  into pots, get them rooted and everything, get them healthy, and then put those into the flowering
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.920]  room. That'll catch everything right up. We're on the same lesson now. Now you're in flower. Now's
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.480]  when you really have to start paying attention and taking good notes. If you've got males,
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.200]  you'll find out about day 10. Get those out of there unless you plan on breeding because those
[18:36.200 --> 18:40.680]  males are going to start dropping pollen. It'll start causing you problems. Get the males out of
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.320]  there about day 10. We talk about that a lot. If you're pheno hunting for males, that'll be a whole
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.360]  another episode, you guys. I'm not even ready to do that. I'll write it down, but I'm not sure that
[18:50.360 --> 18:55.640]  that's going to happen for a long time. Pheno hunting males, that's going to be neat. That's
[18:55.640 --> 19:00.120]  a really advanced lesson. That'll be way up there in the way past episode 100, but we'll talk about
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.720]  it maybe. Pull out the males. Now you want to take a lot of notes because around week three,
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.680]  week four is when you're going to start seeing a lot of different shit. If something herms,
[19:10.680 --> 19:15.400]  you're probably going to see that around between five and eight. Get rid of all of those. You don't
[19:15.400 --> 19:20.360]  want to keep the hermaphrodites. If you've got a 10 pack, you're probably going to get somewhere
[19:20.360 --> 19:25.000]  between four and six boys out of there if you've got regular seeds. You pull those out. Now you've
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.200]  got five more to deal with. If you've got fem seeds and probably you lost one during germ,
[19:30.200 --> 19:33.960]  you only got nine. Now you probably got four or five plants to work with, maybe six.
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.520]  If you're working with fems, you may still have 10 of them. A couple of them are going to be
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.040]  runty. A couple of them will be squatty or whatever. It's okay to pull those squatty plants
[19:42.040 --> 19:47.160]  if they're shitty. If it's healthy and not looking like a runt and a problem, keep it because when
[19:47.160 --> 19:52.440]  you run LA Confidential, the shitty looking plant is the one you want to keep, honestly. It's not
[19:52.440 --> 19:56.920]  the runt. It's not crappy looking. It's the small, slow growing one. If your plant looks like a runt,
[19:56.920 --> 20:01.400]  you can go ahead and get rid of it. You want to watch them grow. Some are going to do stupid shit.
[20:01.960 --> 20:06.440]  Pay attention to what you like. The ones that fall over a lot, if one attracts bugs or one
[20:06.440 --> 20:11.400]  attracts mold, that's not the keeper. Watch for nanners, like I said, around week five or eight.
[20:11.400 --> 20:16.920]  If you get a hermaphrodite, get rid of that one. Take a lot of pictures. Smell them. Pay a lot of
[20:16.920 --> 20:20.760]  attention to how they grow. Then you're going to have to harvest all 10 of these plants or however
[20:20.760 --> 20:25.880]  many made it to the end. I said four to six. Harvest all four to six of these. Trim them down.
[20:27.080 --> 20:30.680]  Cure them properly. Listen to episode number 35 about drying and curing.
[20:31.480 --> 20:37.320]  Dry and cure your medicine properly. Once all of your finished plants are dried and cured,
[20:37.320 --> 20:41.080]  it's time to do a few smoke samples on every phenotype that you've grown.
[20:41.080 --> 20:45.880]  Now, if you're growing it for just you, you can smoke it and you can decide which one you like
[20:45.880 --> 20:49.880]  for yourself. If you're going to be selling it or giving it to medical patients or sharing it with
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.080]  your friends, it's a good idea to pass out a few buds of each one. I don't tell anybody which is
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.000]  which. I just label it A or B. I'm like, tell me which one you like better and tell me why.
[20:59.560 --> 21:03.160]  Then I send it off to a couple of my patients. My buddy, Doug. What's up, Doug? I hope you're
[21:03.160 --> 21:08.520]  listening. Every time I grow new plants, I don't label them. I remember what they are. I'll give
[21:08.520 --> 21:12.280]  them initials or a code word or something. I'll take it to Doug and I'll be like, smoke these.
[21:12.280 --> 21:16.040]  Tell me which ones we need to keep and which ones we should get rid of. Since I'm his medical
[21:16.040 --> 21:21.640]  provider, his opinion is a big influence on what I keep. Then also, White Mike that's on the podcast,
[21:21.640 --> 21:27.800]  Milky Tricomes, Nemo Punk 15. He does a lot of helping with my selection also.
[21:27.800 --> 21:33.560]  If you're the grower, it's a lot up to you. 50% of it is up to the grow. If it grows like shit,
[21:33.560 --> 21:38.440]  if it grows 12 feet tall in eight weeks and you're indoors and you're under an eight-foot ceiling,
[21:38.440 --> 21:43.720]  that's not the phenotype for you. If it grows 32 feet wide in six weeks and you're in a small room,
[21:43.720 --> 21:48.600]  that's not the phenotype for you. If it grows super completely lanky and falls over and needs
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.240]  a thousand stakes and you're trying to get one bud kind of scrog system, that might not be the
[21:53.240 --> 21:58.680]  one for you. Look for the one that grows the way that you want it to grow. Hopefully, that comes
[21:58.680 --> 22:04.760]  out to be the one that smokes well also. Typically, this is what I found as a grower growing a 10-pack.
[22:04.760 --> 22:08.360]  You're going to end up with one that is fucking beautiful. You're going to end up with one that
[22:08.360 --> 22:13.160]  is covered in resin and has a lot of trichomes. Then you'll probably have one that tastes really,
[22:13.160 --> 22:17.560]  really good and you'll have one that harvests really, really heavy. If you can find one that
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.680]  does all of those, then you're golden. That's the one that you want. If you can get two or three of
[22:22.680 --> 22:26.920]  those, if you can get the good high and the good flavor, that's awesome. I would sacrifice that for
[22:26.920 --> 22:30.840]  weight. If you're a cash cropper, maybe you want to sacrifice the good flavor for the weight.
[22:31.400 --> 22:34.120]  Just think about what you want. If you can find a strain that does it all for you,
[22:34.760 --> 22:40.360]  find that, get clones of it, and grow it forever. A good pheno hunt, you have to take clones because
[22:40.360 --> 22:43.320]  if you don't take clones of everything you grow, you're going to end up having the best
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.080]  weed on the planet one time and not have a clone of it and be so pissed off at yourself.
[22:48.200 --> 22:52.600]  All right, guys, that's the basics of a pheno hunt. Basically, keep in mind that not all seeds
[22:52.600 --> 22:57.240]  are going to yield the exact same plants. You might not get the plants that you saw in the
[22:57.240 --> 23:02.440]  package. You might not get the plants that were advertised. Your goal is actually to find the one
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.920]  that you love and keep that one around and turn it into a mother plant. We're going to talk about
[23:06.920 --> 23:10.280]  that in a second. Once you've got that one keeper, you know what you can do next? You got to do
[23:10.280 --> 23:14.600]  another pheno hunt of 10 more seeds and find another keeper. If it's better than the other
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.280]  one that you've got, then toss out that other one or do it until your mother room is full.
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.360]  Just keep hunting for keeper plants and more keeper plants until you've got the most stellar
[23:22.360 --> 23:26.600]  fucking lineup of plants. All right, so let's talk about keeping a mother plant. Now, you've grown
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.160]  this pheno hunt. You have found the plant that you like. You've got the one that has the flavor you
[23:31.160 --> 23:36.280]  like. It gives you the high you like. It grows well for your room. Now, you either took a clone
[23:36.280 --> 23:40.600]  of it or you've got that remaining seed plant that you're going to use as a mother. The trick
[23:40.600 --> 23:45.080]  to keeping that plant as your mother plant is to keep it under a vegetative light. I like to use a
[23:45.080 --> 23:52.360]  19-5 cycle for my mother plants, 19 hours on, 5 hours off, because I feel like this gives my plants
[23:53.160 --> 23:58.680]  plenty of light to keep them from trying to auto flower. Some more tropical strains will try to auto
[23:58.680 --> 24:05.400]  flower if you let them go a little less light. The 19-5, 5 hours to give them a little bit of sleep
[24:05.400 --> 24:10.120]  cycle and let my equipment rest. Every living thing likes to sleep. I like to give my mother
[24:10.120 --> 24:16.520]  plants a little bit of sleep time. You keep your mother plant on a vegetative cycle, a vegetative
[24:16.520 --> 24:22.280]  light cycle to keep it alive indefinitely. I would like to feed it some sort of just a basic
[24:22.920 --> 24:26.840]  veg nutrient. Whatever you're feeding your veg plants, you can feed your mother plants that,
[24:26.840 --> 24:31.320]  just basic nitrogen, keep the roots happy. If you want to keep them for a long time, you're going
[24:31.320 --> 24:38.200]  to have to repot your mothers. They will get root bound. What I do, my mother plants only last me
[24:38.200 --> 24:43.000]  about eight months to a year. I'll cut new mother plants. I'll cut a clone. I'll cut six or eight
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.800]  clones from my mother plant. I will run four or five of those, but I'll keep one of them behind.
[24:48.440 --> 24:51.880]  It'll go into a cup. It'll go into a pot. Then I'll just put it into that mother room
[24:51.880 --> 24:55.960]  and replace the old mother plant because they start to get ran out. They start to get lazy and
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.440]  shit. You take a bunch of cuts from it. You take clones from it. It's been sprayed for bugs. It's
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.920]  been manipulated under these lights for eight months. It starts to get kind of lazy. I feel
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.800]  like it's a good idea to take a fresh cut from my mother plant, keep it under that 18 fucking,
[25:09.800 --> 25:15.320]  that 19.5 light indefinitely, and then just keep it alive. Then if you prune it, if you keep it
[25:15.320 --> 25:19.640]  free of bugs, if you keep it healthy, that mother plant will stick around and give you lots and lots
[25:19.640 --> 25:26.680]  of clones and keep that strain alive forever. I think that wraps up pheno hunting, selecting a
[25:26.680 --> 25:31.560]  keeper and using that keeper as a mother all within, we got that down here in 25 minutes and
[25:31.560 --> 25:35.480]  30 seconds. I think that's going to work for you. Guys, I really appreciate you listening to the
[25:35.480 --> 25:43.080]  podcast. I recorded this in two sessions on a new app called Periscope. I do plan on possibly doing
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.880]  a podcast through Periscope. I will record as normal. I will also record on Periscope. If
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.200]  you're participating on Periscope, you will be able to ask me questions live on the show,
[25:52.200 --> 25:55.720]  and I will answer them for you. You'll only be able to type in the text box, but I'll be able
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.720]  to read them, answer the questions. I'll be able to help out the listeners live on the show. It'll
[25:59.720 --> 26:03.960]  be a little bit more interactive. We're going to try it out once and see how it goes. I will try
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.120]  to announce when it's going to happen so that people can participate, and then we can get people
[26:08.120 --> 26:12.040]  on. Then we'll try to do regularly scheduled shows like that. Every four or five episodes will be a
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.600]  question episode, a live Q&A is what I'm aiming for. Guys, I really appreciate you listening to
[26:16.600 --> 26:20.360]  the show. Everybody on Periscope watching now, thanks for participating. I'm sorry I've been
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.240]  ignoring the chat on Periscope. I'm more focused on the podcast. In the future, I will participate
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.800]  with you guys. Periscope is a new app. You guys check it out. I log in there. You turn on the
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.120]  camera and you talk, and it turns you into basically your own reality show. You guys can
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.480]  watch from wherever you are on your phones. I watch other people's Periscopes also. It's pretty
[26:37.480 --> 26:43.160]  entertaining. Yeah, happy birthday, Maya Bear. I love you so much. Guys, thanks for listening to
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.760]  the podcast. I'll be back in another week with another episode. Don't forget to check out our

[27:02.600 --> 27:06.360]  Find the review section. Give me a five-star rating. Check it out. I need a five-star rating
[27:06.360 --> 27:13.080]  because that moves us up in the ranks. The more people that see the show, the more people will
[27:13.080 --> 27:16.680]  listen to the show, the more people will grow better cannabis, the more better cannabis. I
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.920]  keep saying the more better cannabis. It's such a great fucking set of words. The more quality
[27:20.920 --> 27:24.760]  cannabis will be available for you to smoke, will overgrow the government. There'll be good
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.760]  weed everywhere. More people will listen to the show. So give me five stars. Leave a little comment.
[27:28.760 --> 27:31.720]  Let me know what you think of the show and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[27:32.280 --> 27:35.480]  I would appreciate it if you leave a comment on Stitcher, but Stitcher kind of sucks for
[27:35.480 --> 27:38.920]  leaving comments. It's really hard to leave a comment that I will find. If you've got something
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.880]  to say and you want to make sure it gets to me, you can find me on Twitter. It's at GFYHpodcast.
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.800]  You can find me on Facebook. It's Grow From Your Heart Podcast. You can definitely email me. It's
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.400]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Make sure you get in touch with me. I really love the interaction.
[27:52.280 --> 27:55.800]  Follow me on Periscope if you do that thing. It's brand new. We're just starting that one off.
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.000]  Don't forget, you guys, that every show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.280]  episode is forever archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com. Don't forget there's a donation
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.720]  button on the podcast page. Go to the iRegeneticsColorado.com website. Click on the Grow
[28:09.720 --> 28:13.560]  From Your Heart Podcast tab. At the top right, there's a little PayPal button that goes directly
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.640]  to my PayPal account. I'm never going to charge you for this podcast. This will always be free,
[28:18.520 --> 28:22.040]  but if you do feel like contributing and saying thanks, I would definitely appreciate it. All you
[28:22.040 --> 28:26.440]  got to do, click on there, type in whatever amount you want, and that will go directly to my PayPal
[28:26.440 --> 28:29.880]  account. I will buy a new microphone cover. I've been spitting into this one for quite a while.
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.360]  I would like to get a new mobile recording device so that maybe we can go to the Cannabis Cup,
[28:34.360 --> 28:38.520]  the Secret Cup, other places, and go do podcasts from there. It'd be a little bit easier than
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.920]  hauling around the big rig that I've got. Anyway, I'm not begging, but it would be appreciated.
[28:42.920 --> 28:48.280]  Do it if you'd like. Make sure you follow iRegenetics on Instagram. We're at almost
[28:48.280 --> 28:52.200]  16,000 followers. I post a whole bunch of high-quality cannabis pictures up there.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.600]  Make sure you follow that, you guys. Big shout out to my ninja Spence. Thanks again for listening,
[28:56.600 --> 29:19.810]  you guys. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
