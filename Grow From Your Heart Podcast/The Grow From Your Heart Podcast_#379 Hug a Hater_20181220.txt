[00:00.000 --> 00:04.120]  Welcome to the show podcast world. It's time for episode 379 of the grow from your heart
[00:04.120 --> 00:06.760]  podcast. White Mike is here. Thanks for joining me, bro.
[00:06.760 --> 00:09.160]  What's up, man? Thanks for making the time out of the day
[00:09.160 --> 00:10.920]  from the little ones and making it on the podcast.
[00:10.920 --> 00:13.640]  Yeah. Thanks for having me. Sounds like one guy hates you, but a lot of
[00:13.640 --> 00:18.560]  people requested you back. So thanks for coming. I've got way more than one hater out there.
[00:18.560 --> 00:22.880]  Just one finally expressed it out loud. As always, this episode is brought to you by
[00:22.880 --> 00:26.440]  our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new genetics in your garden, make
[00:26.440 --> 00:32.560]  sure you check out the Hella Dank Seed Company at www.dankseed.store. Mike, it has become
[00:32.560 --> 00:36.120]  tradition that we start the podcast off by letting our friends know what we are dabbing
[00:36.120 --> 00:42.240]  on. Let's tell them what we just took dabs of. I think we just hit the star dog, Fambrosia.
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.080]  One of my favorites. What do you think? It was fantastic.
[00:45.080 --> 00:48.480]  Delicious, right? Very. And it's got a good chatty energy, which
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.080]  that's what we need for the show. I've learned lately that almost all of the
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.480]  dabs give me chatty energy. I've been playing with some stuff lately
[00:57.480 --> 01:01.720]  that is just like an off switch for people, or at least for people like me.
[01:01.720 --> 01:06.720]  I watched Deb and Granny hit some nine pound hammer today. She was giddy. She was chatty.
[01:06.720 --> 01:09.720]  She's talking about all the shit she's got to do. And she's like, let's take a dab, Jeff.
[01:09.720 --> 01:13.520]  And she hits the nine pound hammer. And it was like somebody fucking hit the slow motion
[01:13.520 --> 01:20.120]  button on her for about 30 seconds. She was like, I was like, damn, I just watched you.
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.080]  You never see Granny sit back in the chair. And she just sat back in the chair and took
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.880]  a moment. She goes, you know, I got really high. She had to recheck herself, readjust.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.720]  It happens to the best of us. She had to recalibrate. So you guys, we are
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.480]  hitting the star dog, Fambrosia, from our friends at Apothecary Farms. Dude, how excited
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.840]  are you that Apothecary is 4.5 miles from my house, probably a similar distance from
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.640]  your place? I love it. It's wonderful. It saves me so
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.720]  much time in the damn car. One of my favorite things, just random shit that happened is
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.040]  I walked out of Apothecary a few days ago and Mike was walking in. As I came around
[01:59.040 --> 02:02.320]  the corner, I was like, I think that's Jeff's car. And before I had time to really think
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.640]  about that thought anymore, he came walking out the door with his purchase as I was going
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.360]  in to make mine. Big old smile on my face, made a recommendation. I was like, hey, bro,
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.120]  make sure you get this. Yeah. So shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.560]  They honestly, nobody pays me to talk about the concentrates I smoke. Nobody gives me
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.360]  concentrates or helps me out like that. I just talk about what I enjoy. And today we
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.520]  are enjoying the star dog, Fambrosia, from Apothecary. Great spot over there. I'm so
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.440]  glad they're here in Pueblo. My wallet, on the other hand, may not be as excited.
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.880]  Yeah. That 35, 40 minute drive was a nice deterrent. Yes. Because I don't want to go
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.720]  to that. I don't feel like driving up and back now that it's just across town. I love
[02:38.720 --> 02:42.880]  it. 4.5 miles away. Now everybody knows where I live. They're drawing a map. Apothecary
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.160]  is here. There's a circle. He's in this circle. Let's find him now. Ooh, my precious.
[02:48.160 --> 02:52.760]  All right, you guys, we're going to get real. This is going to be a fun podcast. Mike is
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.680]  here. If you're a regular listener, in a previous episode, I think it was two episodes back,
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.840]  I read some iTunes customer reviews. Within those reviews, somebody stated that they did
[03:02.840 --> 03:07.880]  not enjoy Mike's presence on the podcast. I politely told them how good of a friend
[03:07.880 --> 03:12.800]  Mike is and how important I feel Mike is to the cannabis community, not only to the show,
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.000]  but to the entire community. He's well-spoken. He's an intelligent dude. I'm not just kissing
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.560]  his ass because he's here, but I wanted to say, I said it on a show, I wanted to say
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.560]  it to his face. Mike, I appreciate you on the show. If somebody doesn't like you, bro,
[03:24.560 --> 03:28.680]  skip the fucking episode because Mike is going to be here. Mike's my bro. Mike has been around
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.520]  medical. He's not as outspoken as I am in the same way, but he has been an activist,
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.600]  an advocate, a spokesperson, a role model since I've known him, which was around 2007
[03:38.920 --> 03:44.720]  or 2008. He was doing it before that. I helped someone sign up for the first time on the
[03:44.720 --> 03:51.080]  medical marijuana registry back in 2006. There we go. We spent like eight months working
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.000]  to get a friend of mine on the registry and we finally succeeded in 06. I've been doing
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.880]  this a long time. In my opinion, Mike has earned his spot, not only on the show, but
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.640]  in the community and he should be accepted and involved in this as much as myself. Dude,
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.360]  I really appreciate that, man. Thank you. Yeah, dude. Yeah. It's not just growers. It's
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.360]  not just breeders. It's not just people with a big mouth like me. You make this shit possible.
[04:16.360 --> 04:21.040]  I don't go to the city council meetings as much as I should because I'm prejudged by
[04:21.040 --> 04:26.240]  my appearance and I'm not- That's a big reason why more and more of the community isn't involved.
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.240]  And you're there. You're speaking on behalf of us and you come check with me. You're like,
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.760]  hey, they're going to make new rules. What should we kind of work for? And you kind of
[04:33.920 --> 04:39.120]  get my opinion as a grower, as a heavy consumer. We're both heavy consumers. I'm going to call
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.880]  you a heavy consumer, I'd say, compared to most people. But in our circle, you're one
[04:42.880 --> 04:47.120]  of the lighter consumers, but on a different way. You're much more involved in the medical
[04:47.120 --> 04:53.760]  consumption side. I'm more on the, I don't even, the hip, trendy fucking side of cannabis,
[04:53.760 --> 04:57.120]  I guess. One of the things that, I mean, because this
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.920]  is a free-form show, if y'all haven't picked up on that yet. If you were looking for the
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.240]  second part of the flowering series Jeff is doing, this is not going to be that episode.
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.400]  That'll be Monday, you guys. Stick in. I said stick in. Stick around to tune in. That's the
[05:10.400 --> 05:16.000]  same thing. It sounds gross when you say stick in. I've actually sent Sanjay Gupta a couple of
[05:16.000 --> 05:24.080]  really impassioned emails and social media messages about this. We need a weed-for-focused
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.760]  on THC side of the story. Somewhere over the last five, six years, seven years,
[05:31.600 --> 05:38.800]  we stopped thinking of THC as highly medically active and started thinking of it more as the
[05:38.800 --> 05:44.800]  fun side while CBD is the medical side. That's not at all true. You use THC for a number of
[05:44.800 --> 05:48.480]  medical components. I consider you both a medical and a rec user.
[05:48.480 --> 05:54.000]  Absolutely. But yeah, THC has medical applications,
[05:54.080 --> 05:59.280]  millions and millions of Americans and even more tens of millions of people around the globe
[05:59.280 --> 06:02.640]  use THC medically. You're definitely one of those people, bro.
[06:03.920 --> 06:06.720]  You're also a fucking stoner. Don't let me take that away from you.
[06:06.720 --> 06:12.000]  Guaranteed. I say that my first two dabs, those are medicinal. That third and fourth one,
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.200]  those are purely recreational dabs. That fifth and sixth one, that is just party time. I know
[06:17.200 --> 06:23.120]  that there is a limit. I've got a traumatic brain injury. I've also got some other medical things.
[06:23.120 --> 06:26.000]  I don't even talk about because honestly, I don't think anybody cares. That's not what I'm here for.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.200]  We've got a stomach condition that really fucks me up sometimes and I'll talk about it. But
[06:30.640 --> 06:36.800]  high limonene and high THC strains work very well for my brain injury. Sometimes
[06:37.520 --> 06:41.520]  it just feels like my record skips a little bit. Like my CD, remember when we had CDs? That's how
[06:41.520 --> 06:46.560]  fucking old I am. When your CD would skip just every once in a while, you just know that on that
[06:46.640 --> 06:52.960]  one song that on Come As You Are by Nirvana during that one course, no, I don't have a gun.
[06:52.960 --> 06:56.800]  Just that one time, every time it plays, my brain will do that occasionally. I can't predict when
[06:56.800 --> 07:02.560]  and where, but I get those. If I keep enough limonene and THC in my brain, it doesn't do that.
[07:02.560 --> 07:07.360]  It stops it. It sounds crazy because you're like, you're putting THC into your brain to fix a skip.
[07:07.360 --> 07:12.080]  No, it really puts the puzzle pieces back together. It lubricates my record player.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.480]  I don't know how to describe it, but it makes the-
[07:15.760 --> 07:20.320]  What we've learned about the endocannabinoid system over the last several years is that it
[07:20.320 --> 07:26.320]  maintains homeostasis in your body. That's what that particular system does. Your skeletal system
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.720]  makes it so you're not a fucking blob of flesh on the floor. Your vascular system moves blood
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.000]  around. Your endocannabinoid system makes sure that all the other body systems are working the
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.320]  way they're supposed to. Kind of balance themselves out.
[07:38.960 --> 07:42.960]  That's why cannabis has so many different medical applications. It's because it's
[07:43.600 --> 07:50.240]  not affecting one system or one part of your body. It's affecting the system that governs everything,
[07:50.960 --> 07:54.480]  except breathing and heart rate. For the first time, I wish this show was a video
[07:54.480 --> 07:58.640]  show because when Mike said skeletal system, I started doing the robot. I'm not sure why.
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.520]  I can't help it, folks. I talk with my hands. I'll start making shapes and shit to elaborate
[08:05.520 --> 08:09.280]  my points. Jeff just looks at me like, dude, no camera. You can keep going. It'll come out,
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.280]  though. Your mouth will make those shapes happen if you keep doing it with your hands. I get it.
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.280]  But yes, the endocannabinoid system is- I really think it does balance things out. I don't want
[08:19.280 --> 08:22.400]  to sound like I know what I'm talking about medically, but I know it messes with blood
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.960]  sugar. It messes with hormones. It can balance and throw things out of whack. If things are
[08:26.960 --> 08:30.240]  already a little out of whack, it can make it worse. It can also dial things in. It can
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.960]  exacerbate and fix a lot of things. But I'm sure that it's like a little bondo for my dent, bro.
[08:36.960 --> 08:41.760]  I got just a little divot in my brain. I think that limonene and the THC just smooths it over
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.600]  and just makes it not skip so that my thoughts can complete. You can see sometimes, I'll be like,
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.360]  fucking what are the three words that are blank in my brain? Let's take a couple dabs.
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.840]  Two dabs later, just smooth as can be. Cucumber birdwire.
[08:53.840 --> 08:57.600]  I can do a whole podcast in one cucumber boatwire. I could do the whole-
[08:57.600 --> 08:58.560]  Is it boat or bird?
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.120]  Boat.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.480]  Boat. Cucumber boatwire.
[09:01.600 --> 09:02.640]  If you guys know what we're talking about-
[09:02.640 --> 09:04.080]  Somebody take two points away from my score.
[09:04.080 --> 09:07.040]  If you guys know what we're talking about, you are a champ. Big shout out to my buddy,
[09:07.040 --> 09:10.560]  DB, because I am DB. That's not me. That's him.
[09:14.160 --> 09:14.640]  Fucked us all up.
[09:14.640 --> 09:15.840]  We're so spoiled.
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.320]  Yes.
[09:16.320 --> 09:21.600]  I keep looking down at the table and smiling big because there's enough hash on this table to keep
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.400]  us just roasted for like, well, it's 12 hours.
[09:24.400 --> 09:31.760]  I've been doing some things in New Mexico, business and pleasure. When I'm down there,
[09:31.760 --> 09:34.480]  I get to go hang out at my friend's house. I've got friends in New Mexico.
[09:35.680 --> 09:39.120]  I get to see the New Mexico available product. I'm not trying to bash-
[09:39.120 --> 09:39.840]  How are they doing?
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.640]  They're not. I was going to politely say, I'm not going to bash New Mexico, but they're behind.
[09:45.440 --> 09:52.560]  They're not quite caught up to us on concentrate tech. When I'm in New Mexico, I've got to...
[09:53.200 --> 09:56.160]  I don't think I'm allowed to consume in New Mexico because I'm not a patient. If I were
[09:56.160 --> 10:02.000]  to consume in New Mexico, I wouldn't be as spoiled as I am here. When I get back, I look at the table
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.240]  and I'm like, oh, I'm so spoiled when I'm here, dude.
[10:04.240 --> 10:07.920]  In a couple of very real ways, we've been living in the future for a while now.
[10:07.920 --> 10:08.560]  That's the truth.
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.960]  When it comes to cannabis products that are available, the quality of those products,
[10:12.960 --> 10:14.320]  the glass that's available.
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.240]  I'm going to shout out Albuquerque and stand up for Albuquerque. When you say,
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.280]  you didn't bash them. When you say the glass that is available, dude,
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.080]  Albuquerque is keeping up on the glass scene. A couple of artists down there that have hot glass,
[10:28.080 --> 10:33.120]  saw some good work in Albuquerque. Shout out to those folks. Unfortunately, I didn't write down
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.720]  any names. They know who they are. There are a couple of folks that I saw their work that do
[10:36.720 --> 10:37.760]  a really good job.
[10:37.760 --> 10:38.240]  Nice.
[10:38.240 --> 10:41.520]  Yeah. They know who they is. If you're an Albuquerque glass blower and you're doing it,
[10:41.520 --> 10:42.320]  you know who you are.
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.280]  I get stuff on social media. I'll post something or I'll share something. Then I always get a
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.400]  message from somebody that's removed from legalization. What the fuck is that?
[10:53.120 --> 10:53.760]  What are you doing?
[10:54.720 --> 10:55.920]  What are you smoking, dude?
[10:56.560 --> 11:02.000]  It's an aunt of mine actually sent me a message a little while ago and someone she knows ended up
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.600]  in an anti-pot conference. Then she was given literature and she sent me messages trying to
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.760]  fact check it. I was laughing really hard. She was laughing hard.
[11:11.760 --> 11:14.320]  Right. I'm afraid to get pulled over with my diamonds.
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.240]  I'm not in a diamond container. Of course, this says internally flawless series, apothecary
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.200]  extracts. It's got the place on it. Then when I bought this, it comes with a receipt.
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.400]  They've got a receipt. There's a video on YouTube you can pull up where they throw some dude in jail
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.160]  over a Krispy Kreme frosting flake, like donut glaze.
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.360]  It looks like some little crack rocks.
[11:37.360 --> 11:43.040]  That's not like a euphemism for a drug. I'm talking about the donut sugar frosting.
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.960]  He had a couple of flakes on his format and they racked him for crystal meth. He was in jail for
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.040]  like four days until the test came. The preliminaries came back from the lab that was
[11:53.040 --> 11:59.360]  like, no bitch, that's frosting. Diamonds and hash and shit, I've been worried about that since the
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.640]  beginning. How do I explain to a cop that this is a refill syringe for my vaporizer or a piece of
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.200]  shatter? We know a guy who has a YouTube channel. He goes by the name, I don't know if it's Red
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.760]  Ban or Red Band because there's Brian Red Band, who is a producer and a comedian who used to work
[12:13.760 --> 12:18.720]  with Joe Rogan. Then there's Dan Red Band is who I'm talking about. He is a cannabis activist.
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.880]  He had a YouTube channel that was shut down. I don't know if it's back. If you're a Dan,
[12:22.880 --> 12:28.640]  Red Band supporter, big shout out to Dan and Red Band. He was taken to jail because he had a CBD
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.680]  syringe in his vehicle and they thought it was heroin. The amount of CBD that was in that syringe
[12:33.680 --> 12:37.200]  looked like a fucking lot of heroin, I guess. I don't know how much heroin is a serving. I'm
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.760]  kind of glad I don't know that. I know about a lot of things. I'm 99% ignorant to heroin other
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.600]  than it's illegal and bad and you shoot it up. I don't really know a lot. I'm kind of proud of that.
[12:45.600 --> 12:49.120]  Good job. That's a good thing not to know. All this shit I learned on the street,
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.640]  I don't know much about heroin, which is kind of cool with me. But they took him to jail thinking
[12:52.640 --> 12:55.520]  that that was heroin and they ran it and tested it. Finally, they came back and they're like,
[12:55.520 --> 12:59.760]  dude, you can even have the remaining part that we didn't test back. They gave him back his syringe
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.920]  and shit. I love you, Dan. He's a fucking scrawny little white boy. He has no business in a jail.
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.400]  He's not a criminal. He wouldn't and doesn't do anything to go to jail. He moved here from
[13:10.400 --> 13:15.760]  another state to avoid going to jail. He wanted to follow the rules. I bet he was scared fucking
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.760]  shitless being in jail. That's not his environment. If you're a criminal and you're breaking the rules
[13:19.760 --> 13:25.920]  and you're a thug, you expect maybe I'll go to jail. But Dan is not equipped for that. He didn't
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.800]  see that in life, bro. So yeah, it got him. I've had that thought more than once that
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.160]  like when I come over here, I bring some hash and there's that drive where I'm like,
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.440]  this might be slightly difficult to explain. I'm glad I still have it in the original packaging
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.520]  with labels and shit. Yeah. Yeah. This, uh, this diamond actually says diamonds and it says the
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.480]  carat weight of the diamond, uh, 10 carat internally flawless diamond, and it's got the
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.960]  cannabinoid and stuff written on it. And it had a sticker that had all the stuff right here, but I
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.680]  took that off because you can't open the damn jar without it. But, and I had the original packaging,
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.160]  but yeah, I don't want to go anywhere with this giant. It's looks like a big old fucking crack
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.880]  rock dude. It seriously does look at this thing. Like it's the, that's the one thing the anti-pop
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.080]  folks have been harping on that I actually kind of agree with is yeah. Some of the new hash looks a
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.480]  little cracky. It told this is this free day. It's a massive, that's a two grand diamond. It's
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.040]  the size of your top thumb joint. And it looks like a quartz crystal in a hippie shop.
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.320]  It's bigger than it's almost the size of a junior mint. I would say it's a little bigger than it's
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.440]  almost two junior mints crushed together. The two that got squished together. Yeah. Yeah. The two,
[14:41.440 --> 14:48.320]  two gummy bears, a full gummy bear. I mean, that's, that's a hell of a rock and you're going
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.040]  to be sitting in jail for a few, a few days while the cops test that and confirm that it's THC.
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.000]  And they're going to steal my bad-ass crystal while they're at it. I want to have my rock
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.640]  anymore. I want to dab that bro. Not all at once. Trust me, but that's, that's several,
[15:00.640 --> 15:07.520]  several bunches of good dads right there. But yeah, that if I got to, yeah, I'm, I'm so afraid
[15:07.520 --> 15:11.040]  I drive to New Mexico every few days. Now I got to go down there and do some work and do some
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.600]  pleasure. And I refuse to take anything with me. I won't even drive down there with anything. It's
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.640]  so, I don't see any police down there in New Mexico. Apparently it doesn't have a speed limit
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.040]  from what I've learned, but I still, I know as soon as I put something in the car, they have a
[15:25.040 --> 15:30.080]  speed limit. But to do it, I'm not going to talk about how fast I was going when I passed three
[15:30.080 --> 15:34.880]  state troopers and they didn't budge. They laughed at me. They didn't give a fuck at how fast I was
[15:34.880 --> 15:40.240]  going. But I know the minute that they were cornholing a drum, the white guy with dreadlocks
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.280]  and Colorado plates going the speed I go. As soon as I put one fucking flake of concentrate,
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.200]  the car, they're going to pull me over. I know it. And it is not worth then, then I can't work
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.240]  in the Colorado marijuana enforcement division regulated industry at all. Nope. So that is not
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.280]  worth it. I'm just writing down a note because I have a question for you. I've got a, an out of
[15:59.280 --> 16:05.760]  country trip planned for, um, around my birthday next year. And one of my family members was like,
[16:05.760 --> 16:10.000]  I can take your weed. I'm like, I'm not fucking not. And they're like, well, what do you mean?
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.320]  And I'm like, well, I'm just not gonna take anything. And they're like, you're really,
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.040]  you're really not going to take anything. And it's like, no, like I don't, it's a,
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.440]  it's not that long a trip B it's not nearly that important to me and C it's not an addiction.
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.440]  A pleasure in a medicine. And on top of that, there's a magic that happens with potheads.
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.760]  You don't look like me. I've, I've mentioned earlier that I'm six, five. I got dreadlocks
[16:33.760 --> 16:39.360]  down to my fucking knees. I'm wearing a grassroots hat backwards and crooked. I got a apothecary
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.320]  farms t-shirt on my pants are a little baggy. I'm more in Merrill running like mountain running
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.040]  shoes. I look like I smoke a pound of fucking weed every day. Like it's obvious when, and you can,
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.560]  you can tell when he talked to me that I'm definitely a cannabis consumer. Mike doesn't
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.080]  look like that as much. You've got a couple of hints. You got the earrings that may give you a
[16:56.080 --> 17:00.320]  hint that this guy may break some rules. When I'm on vacation, depending on the country. Like when
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.520]  I'm in Mexico, vendors shout at me like, yo, come here. Do you want some weed? Exactly, exactly
[17:05.520 --> 17:11.120]  where I'm headed with this cannabis consumers find each other and cannabis sellers can find
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.640]  cannabis buyers like a motherfucker. We know I used to be one. We can spot you out of the crowd.
[17:16.640 --> 17:21.520]  It doesn't matter what country you're in. There's someone whose job it is to sell one gram and three
[17:21.520 --> 17:28.000]  and a half gram bags of herb. That person is trained to spot all of the telltale signs of
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.040]  cannabis consumers from all the different little varieties that pass through their area. I've never
[17:33.040 --> 17:39.120]  been somewhere where it was hard for me to get herb. And this is going back to like 98. You
[17:39.120 --> 17:44.000]  can remember going to New York one time to visit family and thinking like, I mean, there's, we're
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  going for graduations. I'm sure there'll be a bunch of beer, but yeah, I'm going to miss my
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.720]  weed a little. And I showed up and two cousins were like, so bear weed. Fuck yes. Yes. I've
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.000]  literally never landed a place without her. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't even have to be the white guy
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.960]  with dreadlocks and it's just, it's serendipitous. Herb knows that you're there. Herb is supposed to
[18:04.960 --> 18:10.560]  be found. Herb is supposed to be smoked. Yeah. It's, it's there. And people, if it's meant to be,
[18:10.560 --> 18:13.920]  and if you don't find it, that's cool. Something else is going to be going on that night.
[18:14.720 --> 18:20.160]  I turned down maybe 30 different sale offers in new Orleans in the 10 days I was there. I was
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.520]  just like, let me sit now. I was the same shit you guys were smoking a minute ago down that alley.
[18:25.520 --> 18:28.640]  No, not interested, bro. Thanks though. I don't know how much plastic was in it,
[18:28.640 --> 18:33.760]  but it smelled like a tire fire. Oh man. Oh man. No, I'm not worried about it at all. And it's
[18:34.480 --> 18:39.280]  like, if you're a long time listener to the show, you know, I'm a tobacco consumer and a
[18:39.280 --> 18:44.960]  caffeine consumer, and I'm heavily addicted to those two things. If I was facing a prospect of
[18:44.960 --> 18:50.320]  a trip for 10 or 15 days where I couldn't consume caffeine or I couldn't consume nicotine,
[18:50.880 --> 18:56.080]  I wouldn't be considering taking that trip. Now I'm a hundred percent comfortable with
[18:56.080 --> 18:59.440]  a 10 or 15 day trip where there's just like, there's probably not going to be any weed.
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.480]  It's fine. It's a very different thing. I'm worried about my body pain that I'm treating with
[19:05.120 --> 19:12.080]  THC and CBD, not my head or being able to sleep. Right. There aren't withdrawal symptoms when you
[19:12.080 --> 19:16.320]  don't have, you might not be able to sleep. I find myself with extra energy because cannabis,
[19:16.320 --> 19:19.200]  obviously when you consume, like I do, it's going to wear you out a little bit. You're going to be
[19:19.200 --> 19:23.280]  a little tired from it by the end of the day. So I don't sleep as well if I don't consume as much,
[19:23.280 --> 19:26.080]  but I'm sure after three or four days, that would just wear right off.
[19:26.640 --> 19:33.280]  My palms sweat. Like I have, I have sticky palms for like three days and it's just gone. It's like
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.760]  I'm nervous for three days. Just my palms though. I don't feel nervous. I'm anxious.
[19:37.760 --> 19:40.320]  That balance is out of balance and you're missing one of the ingredients.
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.440]  So if we're going to take you on a trip and I told you that you had to go 14 day in 14 days,
[19:45.440 --> 19:48.240]  you were going to be gone for 14 days. You got two weeks to prepare and then you're going to
[19:48.240 --> 19:54.400]  be gone for two more weeks. How many days before we left on that trip would you need to taper?
[19:54.400 --> 20:00.000]  You can't smoke cigarettes. You can't consume cannabis and you cannot drink caffeine on this
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.280]  trip. How many days before we leave, do you need to start tapering off your use of those three
[20:05.280 --> 20:14.400]  substances? All right. So it's mandatory. This is definitely happening. Oh yeah. And I'm going
[20:14.400 --> 20:17.280]  to be gone for 14 days. I can't consume any of these. Your kids and wife are going with or
[20:17.280 --> 20:20.800]  without you. You've got to come on this trip. Like your life is on the line.
[20:23.520 --> 20:26.320]  Yeah. Add to the kids in the mix too. No cigarettes and both kids.
[20:26.960 --> 20:33.920]  Um, there's like nicotine's a hell of a drug. Like I can quit caffeine in a couple of days and
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.080]  I'm just a prick for like, I'm short tempered in my, I've got a headache. I was going to ask
[20:38.080 --> 20:44.880]  if you get the caffeine headache bad, about 36 hours into a caffeine, uh, uh, purge. What's the
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.200]  word? A fast. I'd try to, sometimes I'll just try to make it a point about 36 hours and I'll feel
[20:49.200 --> 20:54.720]  it. I'd be like, Oh, there it is right behind the eyes. Five hours after I'm awake. Oh, if I haven't
[20:54.720 --> 21:01.120]  consumed at least one caffeinated beverage, I started getting a headache. Um, when I was in
[21:01.120 --> 21:06.320]  Mexico the last time I was just drinking the local coffee and it wasn't keeping up with what I do
[21:06.320 --> 21:11.440]  with Mountain Dew most days. Um, and there's not all the other ingredients of Mountain Dew in that
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.720]  coffee. There's just the caffeine. Um, and there's not even as much caffeine. So I was having to
[21:16.720 --> 21:20.480]  pound the coffee, but I was able to stay ahead of it. All right. But if we're talking about a trip
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.560]  where there's none of that, like either I'm going to kill everyone else on the trip on day two,
[21:25.440 --> 21:32.000]  or this is going to take like major, like work prep support, probably chemicals.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.760]  Think about how many cigarettes you smoke in a day and then taper that off by 14.
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.680]  I can't taper. If I'm smoking, I smoke like I smoke. Okay. So we just got to take your cigarettes
[21:43.680 --> 21:48.160]  away. Yep. And so we got to do that about five days before, so you can get over the asshole phase.
[21:48.160 --> 21:57.680]  You get about 14 hours before I break. And that's a little longer. If like I smoke normally for the
[21:57.680 --> 22:03.040]  day and then I go to bed and then sleep for like a really long time, like maybe stay to bed for 10
[22:03.040 --> 22:07.280]  hours, I could probably get up and go four or five hours. All right. So you're getting a 15,
[22:07.280 --> 22:12.240]  16 hours tops before I'm like in a homicidal, I will fucking kill you or get to nicotine rage.
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.520]  I feel like we just brought Chad Shank on the show. And if you know who Chad Shank is,
[22:15.520 --> 22:19.600]  you're a cool motherfucker. I don't know if you even know who Chad Shank is, but you just morphed
[22:19.600 --> 22:25.280]  into Chad Shank. And that's really awesome. It's a real addiction. Like I remember being
[22:26.080 --> 22:29.920]  much, much younger, a teenager. And when I just started smoking and I wasn't addicted,
[22:29.920 --> 22:37.120]  I remember that. It's like consuming anything now. Like everybody loves tacos. If you're forced to
[22:37.120 --> 22:42.160]  go two weeks without tacos, it's like not even something you remember a month later. You don't
[22:42.160 --> 22:49.200]  remember that happening. That's so much different with nicotine, dude. It's not even fucking funny.
[22:49.200 --> 22:56.000]  I've been in three car accidents in my life. Two of them are directly related to on the way to
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.040]  acquire nicotine that I didn't have. Like my focus was all about that next dose of nicotine, not on
[23:03.040 --> 23:08.400]  the car driving behind me. God damn it, Mike. So as your friend, you know that those are two
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.000]  problems, right? You know that that's not like, no, this, this wasn't going to kill me. I'm not
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.680]  fucking stop. Okay. As long as, yeah. As, as one of your, we're getting old and I'm considering
[23:15.680 --> 23:19.680]  you people that know how much soda I consume or like how the fuck do you stop kidneys? Yeah,
[23:19.680 --> 23:25.520]  I agree. Um, quite often guys, I set bottle bottle bottles of water. That's the hardest word for my
[23:25.520 --> 23:29.600]  brain bottles of water on the table. And I offer them to Mike and honestly he rolls his eyes at me
[23:29.600 --> 23:34.160]  like I'm fucking retarded for that. I drink plenty of water. It's just, it's I'm over here talking
[23:34.560 --> 23:38.720]  during the show. I need something. Yeah. You like to get on my throat. Yeah, dude, we saw Jan
[23:38.720 --> 23:44.160]  silent Bob do their podcast and Jason news took like fucking four Red Bulls and 45 minutes. Yep.
[23:44.160 --> 23:50.000]  God, I don't know how you'd even do that. That guy's brain is so prime for it. It needs constant
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.680]  feedback. He's, he's just destroyed his dopamine loop. Oh yeah. I've met more than one addict.
[23:55.680 --> 23:59.600]  That's like that, that when they're, they're out in the world talking in chat and it's,
[24:00.240 --> 24:06.080]  they pound Red Bull like it's water and they chain smoke. Yeah. And he couldn't smoke in there. So
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.480]  he had to just pound that. And you guys were not spilling any beans that Jason muse was a
[24:10.480 --> 24:14.560]  heroin addict. He's a recovering addict. That's part of why they do a great podcast. He's very
[24:14.560 --> 24:18.720]  open about it. So we're not spilling anybody's beans that he's in recovery still. Uh, but the
[24:18.720 --> 24:24.160]  man just pounds fucking Red Bulls when he's talking. If you go see Jason, using a J a fucking
[24:24.240 --> 24:29.600]  dude, uh, what's his real name? Kevin Smith. I'm going to call him Bob. I couldn't fucking
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.600]  think of Kevin Smith suddenly. Uh, but if you go see them, pay attention to how many fucking
[24:33.600 --> 24:37.920]  Red Bulls Jason muse pounds. So we have set a good precedent. We understand how the caffeine
[24:37.920 --> 24:42.960]  and the nicotine are a staple. If we take those away from you, you said homicidal, you're going
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.120]  to turn into Chad shank, which is really funny. If you understand that now let's shift our focus.
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.920]  We have removed your caffeine from you. We have removed the nicotine from you. You're a raging
[24:51.920 --> 24:57.200]  asshole. We know that you've got to get on this flight. Now, how far ahead of that trip time? Do
[24:57.200 --> 25:02.640]  we have to start eliminating cannabis from your diet? So to speak for it, not to totally throw
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.400]  your body in the shock. If we cut it off, no, no time, no time. So hypothetically, if you weren't
[25:08.400 --> 25:12.240]  white Mike and you were down to break some fucking rules, you could take some dabs with me in the car
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.320]  as I drop you off at the hypothetical trip that I'm sending you on. And it wouldn't affect you.
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.600]  In the least your body wouldn't start having withdrawal symptoms or shit like that.
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.400]  All right. So I think I mean, that's, I took the really long, especially with this trip that we're
[25:26.400 --> 25:32.720]  planning because, um, we're, we're traveling to Europe. So, but the flights fucking up my sleep
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.000]  patterns as there's substantially more than the lack of cannabis. Oh yeah. And so I'm not even
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.560]  going to notice one of the only two symptoms I feel at all, because I'm going to attribute most
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.400]  of that symptom to the jet lag. All right. And like, it's going to be the end of March, early
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.640]  April in Paris, like having sweaty palms, ain't going to be a problem. I'm going to be wearing
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.160]  a hoodie anyway. How long of a flight is that dude? Um, it's like 10 or 12, 14 hours. God damn.
[26:00.160 --> 26:10.000]  I think when I went in 2000, it was like four or five hours to DC and then 10 or 12 to Paris.
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.080]  And that last, that second flight, you just fucking brutal. Yeah. Just brutal. You just
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.280]  flying normal civilian class that long. Yeah. I got lucky. I was in a bulkhead. So you get
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.600]  a little bit extra. You're the first row of seats behind first class. So you get like an extra four
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.520]  inches of leg room. Hell yeah. You're our height dude. Every fucking quarter, which matters. Um,
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.680]  I'm six, five and Mike's what? Six, three, six, four. Yep. Yeah. And, but Mike's probably got a
[26:33.680 --> 26:41.680]  good 40 or 50 pounds on me as well. It hurts. He said it's a seriously from the, my back hip bone,
[26:41.680 --> 26:48.720]  like at the top of my ass to my knee cap is exactly the same length from the back of my
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.320]  seat that I'm sitting in, in the airplane to the back of the asshole in front of me.
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.240]  My knee sits flush against your arm rest and my leg is locked in there hard.
[26:58.240 --> 27:03.040]  I was trying to get on a ride at six flags and the girl said, put your legs down. And I was like,
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.560]  fucking where, like, what do you want me to do with them? Yeah. More than once I've, I've gone
[27:08.560 --> 27:12.800]  to, to ride an amusement ride, like a roller coaster or something. And the carny is just like,
[27:13.600 --> 27:21.680]  yeah, you don't, you're too big. Like, like I get to only 17, but you don't fit anymore. You're too
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.840]  tall. The cage doesn't come down over your shoulders anymore. And it's like, wait, you can
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.320]  build it for 450, 500 pound people, but you can't build it for people who are taller than six foot.
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.520]  What the fuck? All right. So I think I made my point. Uh, if Mike has to eliminate the caffeine
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.000]  and the nicotine from his diet, he will become a homicidal maniac, which I think were his own
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.040]  words. The caffeine is not so bad. It's just a bad headache, but nicotine's a different class
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.880]  of drug, dude. But if we took away your cannabis, you'd be just fine. Just fine. No withdrawals,
[27:48.880 --> 27:54.720]  no craziness. Just fine. Just fine. Me too. Me too. I wouldn't sleep for a day or two. I bet you
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.800]  just because I give a lot of my energy to the end of the day energy. It calms me down. That's how I
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.840]  just mellow myself out. But after a couple of days, it's partly the ritual is what I would miss the
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.800]  most. Just hanging out with you. You want to take a couple of dabs, bro? Like let's try this
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.200]  Clementine. Let's try this, whatever we got this citrudellic sunset and just try them all and see
[28:13.200 --> 28:16.640]  what we got. You know, it's just part of the fun, but I think after a few days, I'd be completely
[28:16.640 --> 28:20.560]  okay with it. Like, all right, we're not dabbing right now. We'll be okay. And then if I'm on
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.160]  vacation, like you said, you're going to Europe. If I was on vacation or something, it wouldn't
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.440]  give a shit. I'd be like, look at all the vacation I've got to see. You don't even need to be
[28:27.440 --> 28:32.080]  stoned for this. You can enjoy that. When I was in new Orleans, I didn't miss cannabis at all.
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.160]  And I kept running into it when I was in Mexico, I ran into bad weed right away.
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.400]  And it wasn't worth trying to look or look, find more, but it was a, it's kind of a stressful trip.
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.360]  And it was nice to be able to go step away from everything for 15 minutes and just break up a
[28:47.360 --> 28:54.240]  little fucking piece of brick weed, empty out a cigarette, fucking repackage. I couldn't even get
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.720]  rolling papers out. Oh man. It was weird. I, everywhere I'd go and try to get papers, they'd
[28:58.720 --> 29:02.800]  look at me funny and try to send me swishers. And I was like, no, I don't want to want to blunt.
[29:02.800 --> 29:08.480]  Yeah. I don't want to blind. Exactly. You said break up some brick weed. It makes you humble.
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.800]  Right. Takes you back to those days. And the people that gave it to me were so like,
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.840]  they were so excited. They, they knew I was coming into in, in the next day and they wanted
[29:17.840 --> 29:21.120]  to have some weed ready for me. They found some dude that was going to sell them weed.
[29:21.120 --> 29:25.920]  They sold them way more weed than they were expecting. Like they, they gave them enough
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.600]  money for a decent amount of like regular American bud. Oh yeah. And they got it's equivalent in
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.120]  Mexi brick. Yeah. I don't know what to do with this. Take an ounce and a half. And I'm like,
[29:35.120 --> 29:39.040]  dude, only here for a few days, but whatever. Yeah. And it was nice to be able to step away
[29:39.120 --> 29:44.640]  and just have that ritual, break it up, clean it up, roll it up. But it was more get away from
[29:44.640 --> 29:50.640]  everybody and just let my own thoughts simmer for 15 minutes rather than consuming THC.
[29:50.640 --> 29:54.880]  An actual vacation. All right, Mike, I feel like we've been rambling for quite a while.
[29:54.880 --> 29:58.640]  You want to start wrapping up this podcast? Yeah. Before I get myself in any more trouble.
[29:58.640 --> 30:01.760]  Yeah. Let's see what else you can say into a microphone. Hey, we should tell everybody how
[30:01.760 --> 30:06.560]  they can find you on the social media. You can find me at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on

[31:53.200 --> 31:58.160]  me up on social media. Uh, every time I'm on the podcast, I get four or five new Instagram followers.
[31:58.160 --> 32:01.760]  I almost never post to Instagram. Um, but you can follow me there too.
[32:01.760 --> 32:06.160]  There you go. Follow Mike. He'll get four or five more followers. That's funny. I was on Deb and
[32:06.160 --> 32:10.160]  granny's live feed this afternoon and I must've gotten 50 new followers just from hanging out
[32:10.160 --> 32:15.440]  with granny for about 15 minutes. It's so funny. I was in her live feed one day and I commented,
[32:15.440 --> 32:21.600]  she saw my comment and shouted me out and my Instagram just fucking got lit up. It was like
[32:21.600 --> 32:26.320]  a stop sign in a forest. It's all it takes. It's all it takes is for Deb and granny to say hello
[32:26.320 --> 32:29.760]  and your social media will go crazy. Big shout out to my friend, Deb and granny. I love you every
[32:29.760 --> 32:33.040]  day, Gail. I hope you're listening to this. I hope you and Kevin are having a wonderful day.
[32:33.040 --> 32:35.920]  Hope everything is going your way. I love you every single fucking day.
[32:37.120 --> 32:39.440]  All right, Mike, I think that was your chance to say what you had to say.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.640]  Hug a hater, fuck a troll. That should have been it. That should have been all you said
[32:44.640 --> 32:49.040]  this whole podcast, dude. That covered all of your points. Half of me wants to fucking just like,
[32:49.840 --> 32:53.360]  I'll go smoke another cigarette. We'll just start this fresh. We'll record a whole different
[32:53.360 --> 32:58.720]  episode here in 10 minutes. I don't know if this was this place. We went a lot of places.
[32:58.720 --> 33:02.400]  We went a lot of places. There's going to be some editing in this show. There will be some editing.
[33:02.400 --> 33:06.560]  There's some stuff that was just unusual folks. Not usual. Anyway, thanks for hanging out. You
[33:06.560 --> 33:09.680]  guys were going to wrap this up before Mike incriminates himself any further. He's in a mood
[33:09.680 --> 33:12.480]  tonight. He needs a cigarette. He's already got his fucking headphones off. You guys,
[33:12.480 --> 33:15.200]  you should see this kid. I'm just going to turn off his mic so we can dip and go smoke. Mike,
[33:15.200 --> 33:18.480]  thanks for hanging out on the podcast. Everybody. Thanks for being here. I had a great time with
[33:18.480 --> 33:22.160]  you. Mike had a good time with you. He's given you a Sergeant salute and a big wave as he
[33:22.160 --> 33:26.640]  runs out the door to go get that cancer stick into his lungs. It's cold out there and he's
[33:26.640 --> 33:31.200]  still going to go smoke. Fucking savage. All right, podcast ruled. I'll be back Monday with
[33:31.200 --> 33:34.720]  a fresh new episode. We will continue the grow lessons. I want to give a huge shout out to my
[33:34.720 --> 33:39.600]  buddy Reefer Madness. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
