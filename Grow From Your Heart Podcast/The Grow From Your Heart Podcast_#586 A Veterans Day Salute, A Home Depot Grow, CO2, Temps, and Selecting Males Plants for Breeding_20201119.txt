[00:00.190 --> 00:02.950]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:02.950 --> 00:08.070]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and it is time for episode 586 of the Grow
[00:08.070 --> 00:10.190]  From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.190 --> 00:13.470]  This evening I'm recording on Veterans Day, so I would like to start the show off with
[00:13.470 --> 00:16.830]  a big thank you shout out to all of the veterans out there.
[00:16.830 --> 00:20.070]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon messages.
[00:20.070 --> 00:22.230]  One of those messages comes from a veteran.
[00:22.230 --> 00:27.190]  Another one comes from a listener with questions about selecting male plants for breeding.
[00:27.190 --> 00:30.550]  Before we get to those Patreon messages, you know I like to start the show off by talking
[00:30.550 --> 00:31.990]  about what I'm smoking.
[00:31.990 --> 00:35.430]  Today I've been taking dabs of coin style live batter.
[00:35.430 --> 00:39.510]  This is a blend of Sugartown Express and Lemon G13.
[00:39.510 --> 00:44.590]  On the package, the flavor is described as a coin style margarita on the rocks.
[00:44.590 --> 00:49.110]  It has been a really long time since I've had a coin style margarita on the rocks, so
[00:49.110 --> 00:50.870]  I'm just going to agree with that.
[00:50.870 --> 00:57.790]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 65.85% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[00:57.790 --> 01:01.990]  So big shout out to the coin style live batter.
[01:01.990 --> 01:05.110]  Alright let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[01:05.110 --> 01:10.590]  Of course the 710 club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or
[01:10.590 --> 01:11.590]  higher.
[01:11.590 --> 01:14.670]  So with no further ado, let's start it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:14.670 --> 01:17.070]  thank you shout out to our friend Rumble Buns.
[01:17.070 --> 01:20.710]  Let's follow that up with a big thank you shout out to our friend Jacob W.
[01:20.830 --> 01:23.750]  Let's send a big thank you shout out and a fist bump to Matt H.
[01:23.750 --> 01:26.510]  I want to send a thank you shout out to a long time supporter.
[01:26.510 --> 01:28.430]  Let's say thank you to Godfather Kush.
[01:28.430 --> 01:30.510]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Redbeard.
[01:30.510 --> 01:31.510]  What up Redbeard?
[01:31.510 --> 01:33.170]  I think I might be part of your gang.
[01:33.170 --> 01:35.870]  Let's follow that up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[01:35.870 --> 01:38.110]  our friend Canna Organic Illinois.
[01:38.110 --> 01:40.270]  Big shout out to our friends out there in Illinois.
[01:40.270 --> 01:44.070]  I want to follow that one up with a special thank you shout out to our friend Glyn Geroni.
[01:44.070 --> 01:45.710]  Thank you for the long time support.
[01:45.710 --> 01:48.510]  I've also got a big thank you shout out for another long time supporter.
[01:48.510 --> 01:50.990]  Let's send a special thank you to the Canna Crat.
[01:50.990 --> 01:52.930]  And another long time follower and supporter.
[01:52.930 --> 01:55.590]  Let's say a special thank you to Blackbird 76.
[01:55.590 --> 01:59.270]  I want to send a big high five and a fist bump to my friend Craig Compton.
[01:59.270 --> 02:02.350]  Let's follow that one up with a special thank you shout out to Michael Harper.
[02:02.350 --> 02:06.230]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[02:06.230 --> 02:09.330]  shout out to the captain and commander of the 710 Club.
[02:09.330 --> 02:12.930]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Lemur Priest.
[02:12.930 --> 02:16.710]  Big thank you and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:16.710 --> 02:20.070]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[02:20.070 --> 02:25.990]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:25.990 --> 02:29.670]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:29.670 --> 02:33.710]  Once again, thank you for all of the support and I did include a link in the show notes
[02:33.710 --> 02:37.870]  and in the video description to make it nice and easy for everybody who's got their hands
[02:37.870 --> 02:39.110]  full during the show.
[02:39.110 --> 02:43.350]  All right, I think that is enough rambling and chatter at the start of the show.
[02:43.350 --> 02:46.670]  Let's jump right into some of these Patreon messages.
[02:46.670 --> 02:49.270]  I did say that the first message comes from a veteran.
[02:49.270 --> 02:53.390]  So with no further ado, this one goes just like this.
[02:53.390 --> 02:55.830]  It says greetings and salutations.
[02:55.830 --> 03:00.150]  I hope this message finds you and all that hear it safe and enjoying life.
[03:00.150 --> 03:01.150]  I am safe.
[03:01.150 --> 03:02.150]  I'm nice and warm.
[03:02.150 --> 03:03.150]  I'm enjoying life.
[03:03.150 --> 03:04.150]  So thank you.
[03:04.150 --> 03:05.930]  I hope you're doing the same my friend.
[03:05.930 --> 03:12.030]  It goes on to say in episode 576, you assisted a fellow veteran and that's when I learned
[03:12.030 --> 03:13.470]  of your show.
[03:13.470 --> 03:15.710]  Then they said apologies for taking so long.
[03:15.750 --> 03:18.990]  Hey, no reason to apologize for just discovering the show.
[03:18.990 --> 03:20.270]  I'm glad you are here.
[03:20.270 --> 03:23.430]  I'm glad you're able to listen and I'm glad you're able to learn.
[03:23.430 --> 03:24.970]  And I do plan on helping more veterans.
[03:24.970 --> 03:29.670]  You said that you heard when I assisted a veteran, I did get a light into the hands
[03:29.670 --> 03:30.670]  of a grower.
[03:30.670 --> 03:32.350]  There is a brand new grow light.
[03:32.350 --> 03:33.670]  Thanks to Keith at Blacksail.
[03:33.670 --> 03:34.870]  There's a package of seeds.
[03:34.870 --> 03:37.390]  Thanks to Irie Genetics in a veteran's hands.
[03:37.390 --> 03:39.610]  They are growing because we helped them out.
[03:39.610 --> 03:42.230]  So thanks to the Irie Army for all the support.
[03:42.230 --> 03:43.590]  We will be helping more veterans.
[03:43.590 --> 03:45.670]  A lot of people have reached out needing lights.
[03:45.670 --> 03:48.190]  A few people have reached out trying to give out lights.
[03:48.190 --> 03:49.190]  There's just one of me.
[03:49.190 --> 03:51.510]  So connecting all of these people is taking me a little bit.
[03:51.510 --> 03:52.510]  I will get it organized.
[03:52.510 --> 03:53.510]  It will happen.
[03:53.510 --> 03:54.630]  I have a lot going on.
[03:54.630 --> 03:57.990]  Not making excuses, just letting you know it is in progress.
[03:57.990 --> 03:59.150]  There will be more lights given out.
[03:59.150 --> 04:00.150]  Let's keep going.
[04:00.150 --> 04:02.190]  It says I myself am a disabled veteran.
[04:02.190 --> 04:07.710]  I suffered a botched Whipple surgery while in the Navy in 2003 and willingly would provide
[04:07.710 --> 04:09.070]  proof.
[04:09.070 --> 04:12.230]  The statement about providing proof is because I have mentioned on the show that there are
[04:12.390 --> 04:15.990]  too many people out there trying to take advantage of kind people, too many people trying to
[04:15.990 --> 04:20.990]  take advantage of the COVID situation, and they are taking donations and receiving gifts
[04:20.990 --> 04:24.590]  undeservingly, I guess.
[04:24.590 --> 04:27.110]  It is stolen valor is what they are doing.
[04:27.110 --> 04:31.630]  And this veteran is just saying, before you even ask, I can prove that I'm a veteran.
[04:31.630 --> 04:32.630]  I trust you.
[04:32.630 --> 04:35.470]  If you're going to write in and tell me you're a veteran and not ask for anything like that,
[04:35.470 --> 04:36.590]  I believe you.
[04:36.590 --> 04:38.590]  This message all tells me that you are a veteran.
[04:38.590 --> 04:40.030]  I have no doubt in there.
[04:40.030 --> 04:41.550]  But thank you for backing that up.
[04:41.590 --> 04:42.590]  It goes on.
[04:42.590 --> 04:46.510]  It does say, I have never grown, but I've been a cannabis connoisseur for half of my
[04:46.510 --> 04:47.510]  lifetime.
[04:47.510 --> 04:54.190]  I'm finally getting the courage to cut a cold turkey cut off VA doctor recommended prescription
[04:54.190 --> 04:56.550]  opioids after 10 years.
[04:56.550 --> 05:01.350]  So the veteran doctor was recommending a prescribing opioids for the past 10 years.
[05:01.350 --> 05:03.270]  He's finally cut it off and found it difficult.
[05:03.270 --> 05:07.390]  So we turned to the beautiful form of gardening and found that not only do I have a great
[05:07.390 --> 05:11.750]  set of green lungs, but I also have a green thumb to match.
[05:11.750 --> 05:12.750]  Yes.
[05:12.750 --> 05:16.350]  Being a military person, you have got, uh, what's the word?
[05:16.350 --> 05:21.070]  Dedication, discipline, all of that stuff is driven into you and now you've got passion.
[05:21.070 --> 05:24.710]  So with that dedication, passion, discipline, you will be an amazing grower.
[05:24.710 --> 05:29.990]  I often find that people with a kitchen background, they've got discipline and motivation.
[05:29.990 --> 05:34.030]  People with a martial arts background, wrestling backgrounds, people that wrestled in school,
[05:34.030 --> 05:35.070]  worked in kitchens.
[05:35.070 --> 05:38.990]  They're always good growers, good in the gardens because they've got that determination, that
[05:38.990 --> 05:39.990]  discipline.
[05:39.990 --> 05:41.710]  And then you put passion behind that.
[05:41.710 --> 05:44.870]  That turns those people into savages in the grow room.
[05:44.870 --> 05:49.190]  It does go on to say, I definitely don't have much in the way of friends or family.
[05:49.190 --> 05:51.510]  What you do now, now you were a part of the Irie army.
[05:51.510 --> 05:52.510]  So welcome to the crew.
[05:52.510 --> 05:53.990]  Uh, welcome to the gang.
[05:53.990 --> 05:58.070]  It says, so I enjoy your podcast and the people I get to interact with in chat during the
[05:58.070 --> 05:59.070]  show.
[05:59.070 --> 06:01.870]  Uh, that means you're hanging out in the premieres on YouTube.
[06:01.870 --> 06:03.910]  So thank you for being there on YouTube at midnight.
[06:04.350 --> 06:08.590]  The shows do come out Monday night at midnight, Monday morning at midnight and Thursday morning
[06:08.590 --> 06:09.590]  at midnight.
[06:09.590 --> 06:10.590]  We do a premiere on YouTube.
[06:10.590 --> 06:12.870]  I hang out, I chat with the gang that's there.
[06:12.870 --> 06:13.870]  Join us, hang out.
[06:13.870 --> 06:15.550]  You can meet our new veteran friend named Mr.
[06:15.550 --> 06:16.670]  Be in the live chat with us.
[06:16.670 --> 06:17.670]  It's a good time.
[06:17.670 --> 06:20.190]  It's a, it's always a ramble fest, some kind of a giggle fest.
[06:20.190 --> 06:21.550]  Shout out to Dave's not here.
[06:21.550 --> 06:22.550]  OG purple thumb.
[06:22.550 --> 06:24.070]  A lot of great people in there.
[06:24.070 --> 06:25.070]  I can't list all of you.
[06:25.070 --> 06:26.070]  A lot of you are on my mind.
[06:26.070 --> 06:27.070]  I can't say all your names right now.
[06:27.070 --> 06:28.070]  It'll get to be a long show.
[06:28.070 --> 06:29.790]  Uh, but come hang out with us on Mondays.
[06:29.790 --> 06:30.790]  I encourage you.
[06:30.790 --> 06:31.830]  That's where our friend is talking about that.
[06:31.830 --> 06:32.830]  They hang out.
[06:32.830 --> 06:37.470]  There is more to go on with, uh, this and the podcast and the people I get are interact.
[06:37.470 --> 06:43.290]  This is, this is the, uh, let's see this and the, there we go.
[06:43.290 --> 06:46.190]  This and the assist shown to the, I'm not going to edit that out for you guys.
[06:46.190 --> 06:47.970]  You could see that I'm a real person.
[06:47.970 --> 06:52.150]  This and the assist shown to the lady veteran is the reason for me deciding to become a
[06:52.150 --> 06:55.510]  $10 a month financial contributor.
[06:55.510 --> 06:56.510]  Thank you.
[06:56.510 --> 07:01.790]  I'm sure that being a disabled veteran that, uh, you don't have a lot of spare money.
[07:01.790 --> 07:05.670]  So that 10 bucks means a lot to me that you're on a very limited income.
[07:05.670 --> 07:08.450]  You don't have a way that I know of that you can just go make extra money.
[07:08.450 --> 07:10.070]  A lot of us can just go get a second job.
[07:10.070 --> 07:12.110]  We could do a side job, make some extra money.
[07:12.110 --> 07:13.110]  You may not have that option.
[07:13.110 --> 07:14.990]  And if you do, you may lose some of your benefits.
[07:14.990 --> 07:18.910]  So thank you for contributing some of that allotted money to me.
[07:18.910 --> 07:19.910]  I appreciate that.
[07:19.910 --> 07:20.950]  I respect that a lot.
[07:20.950 --> 07:21.950]  Thank you.
[07:21.950 --> 07:26.830]  Um, it goes on to say, um, Oh, I wanted to put in there, uh, you're in the ire army now
[07:26.830 --> 07:29.150]  that's a lot less pushups and a lot more bong rips.
[07:29.150 --> 07:31.910]  That's actually a note that I wrote on my paper had to say that.
[07:31.910 --> 07:35.270]  Uh, so it goes on to say not being able to afford the high quality gear.
[07:35.270 --> 07:40.230]  I decided that high quality information is even better, especially when applied properly.
[07:40.230 --> 07:43.190]  It sounds like we've got a, a MacGyver on our hands here.
[07:43.190 --> 07:47.390]  And I like this kind of person, someone that learns they've got the motivation, the determination,
[07:47.390 --> 07:48.390]  the discipline.
[07:48.390 --> 07:50.470]  And now when there's a will, there is a way.
[07:50.470 --> 07:53.590]  And our MacGyver veteran friend here is going to whip up some shit and make it happen.
[07:53.590 --> 07:54.590]  I love the way he does it.
[07:54.590 --> 07:55.590]  We'll keep going.
[07:55.590 --> 08:00.870]  He says, so ever since I listened to episode five 76, I've been slowing.
[08:00.870 --> 08:05.150]  I've been slowly listening to all of your previous episodes while taking copious amounts
[08:05.150 --> 08:06.150]  of notes.
[08:06.150 --> 08:08.630]  Uh, man, I'm glad you're catching up and learning a lot.
[08:08.630 --> 08:13.270]  It says I am growing in a closet with a complete home Depot grow kit.
[08:13.270 --> 08:17.390]  Uh, and he said that's been acquired by wandering around home Depot, looking for comparable
[08:17.390 --> 08:19.950]  items to the vast array I see.
[08:19.950 --> 08:24.150]  And I implemented while learning about my wonderful new craft and trade.
[08:24.710 --> 08:28.310]  Uh, there are a lot of great things at home Depot that could definitely build you a nice
[08:28.310 --> 08:29.310]  grow.
[08:29.310 --> 08:30.750]  I'm sure you've got a good start.
[08:30.750 --> 08:33.670]  I was at home Depot looking for lighting for this new area.
[08:33.670 --> 08:34.750]  There's a new ceiling light up here.
[08:34.750 --> 08:37.150]  You probably can't tell cause these lights are overpowering.
[08:37.150 --> 08:40.310]  I got a new led ceiling like that fucker is bright.
[08:40.310 --> 08:45.230]  When I was there, I saw this big square led light panel and I thought that would be an
[08:45.230 --> 08:47.790]  amazing grow light for somebody who had to be stealth.
[08:47.790 --> 08:52.430]  Like so there are things at home Depot at Lowe's at your local hardware shop that will
[08:52.430 --> 08:57.150]  definitely get you through a grow, build yourself a nice little MacGyver grow space.
[08:57.150 --> 08:58.670]  Just like our veteran friend here is doing.
[08:58.670 --> 09:02.070]  Uh, it says I do have a grow question that has alluded me.
[09:02.070 --> 09:03.070]  All right.
[09:03.070 --> 09:04.070]  I look forward to this one.
[09:04.070 --> 09:07.870]  It says knowing that our beautiful divas can tolerate higher temperatures when implementing
[09:07.870 --> 09:08.870]  CO2.
[09:08.870 --> 09:12.830]  My question is why push these higher temps when I've also come across the information
[09:12.830 --> 09:16.990]  that higher temperatures also destroy the turps.
[09:16.990 --> 09:19.070]  So yes, that is accurate.
[09:19.070 --> 09:24.870]  When we are running high amounts of CO2 in a grow room, we can also run higher temperatures.
[09:24.870 --> 09:27.630]  It's not necessary, but you can do it.
[09:27.630 --> 09:31.910]  Uh, generally I'll keep the grow in the low eighties, high seventies, low eighties and
[09:31.910 --> 09:34.150]  flowering usually 79, 84.
[09:34.150 --> 09:35.150]  That's kind of where I want to be.
[09:35.150 --> 09:37.150]  Don't go any higher than 84.
[09:37.150 --> 09:40.670]  Like I try to say about 77, 82, but I mean 84 cause it's summertime in Colorado.
[09:40.670 --> 09:42.350]  It gets hot sometimes.
[09:42.350 --> 09:43.630]  So I try not to go any hotter than that.
[09:43.630 --> 09:48.590]  If you're running a lot of CO2, you can go 87, 88 degrees, maybe a little higher.
[09:48.590 --> 09:50.990]  I don't like to go too much higher than that.
[09:50.990 --> 09:56.030]  When you're running CO2, the plants won't react too poorly to that, but you do have
[09:56.030 --> 09:58.110]  that risk of burning off the turps.
[09:58.110 --> 10:04.390]  Now, the reason most people are running the heat a little bit higher with the CO2 is because
[10:04.390 --> 10:07.310]  they can't cool the room efficiently.
[10:07.310 --> 10:11.190]  And instead of investing in more cooling equipment, they got CO2.
[10:11.190 --> 10:12.430]  That is quite often the case.
[10:12.430 --> 10:15.710]  Not always, but that is a way if you've got a little bit too much heat, you can't get
[10:15.710 --> 10:17.350]  it down that couple of degrees.
[10:17.350 --> 10:18.990]  You can't plug in another air conditioner.
[10:18.990 --> 10:20.190]  You can't get more ventilation.
[10:20.190 --> 10:23.390]  You're struggling with two, three, maybe four more degrees.
[10:23.390 --> 10:24.390]  Spend the money on CO2.
[10:24.390 --> 10:27.910]  You get bigger, better, faster growth, and you don't have to battle the heat.
[10:27.910 --> 10:32.510]  So it's not always the perfect solution to have the high temp and the CO2.
[10:32.510 --> 10:35.470]  Sometimes it's just circumstance and it is what was done.
[10:35.470 --> 10:37.110]  Sometimes it was the easiest solution.
[10:37.110 --> 10:38.950]  Sometimes it was the cheapest solution.
[10:38.950 --> 10:40.730]  Sometimes it was the only solution.
[10:40.730 --> 10:46.670]  So you are correct in all of the above things that we can go higher temps with higher CO2.
[10:46.990 --> 10:52.670]  And you were also correct in thinking that higher temperatures do volatilize our terpenes.
[10:52.670 --> 10:58.110]  I think, I don't think that the temperatures we are getting, the differential between no
[10:58.110 --> 11:03.270]  CO2 and CO2 temperature grow rooms are enough to destroy too many terps.
[11:03.270 --> 11:04.270]  It's just a few degrees.
[11:04.270 --> 11:07.230]  You're getting up to like, I don't even want to say 90 degrees.
[11:07.230 --> 11:09.110]  That's going to start fucking with terps.
[11:09.110 --> 11:13.590]  But a lot of what we're talking about, I think comes from the old school grow world.
[11:13.590 --> 11:17.070]  Like I said, this came from when we couldn't add another air conditioner or maybe the black
[11:17.070 --> 11:20.710]  market grow world or the underground grow world or the free market grow world, whatever
[11:20.710 --> 11:24.110]  you want to call it, the non-regulated grow world where people had to be a little bit
[11:24.110 --> 11:26.630]  more secretive, a little bit more quiet about it.
[11:26.630 --> 11:34.070]  So it wasn't always ideal to run the CO2 without the air conditioner, but it wasn't, there
[11:34.070 --> 11:35.390]  wasn't another option.
[11:35.390 --> 11:39.870]  Also the reason I brought up old school and back in the day, because we probably didn't
[11:39.870 --> 11:41.630]  know as much about terps then.
[11:41.630 --> 11:43.490]  We didn't know we were cooking the terps off.
[11:43.490 --> 11:46.890]  So we just thought it's fucking cool enough to let the plants grow.
[11:46.890 --> 11:47.890]  They're happening.
[11:47.890 --> 11:48.930]  So let's just let it grow.
[11:48.930 --> 11:54.370]  So they were probably just using the CO2 because they couldn't cool the room and it was the
[11:54.370 --> 11:55.370]  option.
[11:55.370 --> 12:00.350]  I don't know that that heat is going to be enough to disrupt and destroy the terps.
[12:00.350 --> 12:03.210]  And also we didn't know about terps at that time.
[12:03.210 --> 12:05.850]  So that's why we weren't too worried about the terpenes.
[12:05.850 --> 12:08.810]  Terpenes are kind of for a little while there.
[12:08.810 --> 12:10.970]  Terpenes were just the word of the day.
[12:10.970 --> 12:13.570]  Terp was the word of the day for a little while.
[12:13.570 --> 12:15.090]  Terps will go away and it's going to be something new.
[12:15.090 --> 12:16.530]  It was CBD for a minute.
[12:16.530 --> 12:20.050]  So now that terps have been the hot thing, we've all learned about terps and that's why
[12:20.050 --> 12:23.170]  we're more concerned, more educated and more worried about terps.
[12:23.170 --> 12:27.250]  Now we try not to get the room so hot hopefully, but I think part of it was because we couldn't
[12:27.250 --> 12:30.370]  add more air conditioning because we were in a black market grow.
[12:30.370 --> 12:34.410]  And I think another part of it is because we simply were not educated on terpenes and
[12:34.410 --> 12:36.410]  the volatility of terpenes.
[12:36.410 --> 12:37.410]  So I want to continue.
[12:37.410 --> 12:38.410]  There's more.
[12:38.410 --> 12:50.210]  I'm not sure if you're able to incorporate the services, but Omaha Steaks had a service
[12:50.210 --> 12:56.790]  a service called ID me where veterans are able to confirm their veteran status.
[12:56.790 --> 13:02.210]  Also most veterans could share a redacted copy of their DD 213 form.
[13:02.210 --> 13:06.410]  I would gladly share my unredacted DD 213 for some growers love.
[13:06.410 --> 13:09.210]  Hey, I trust you and respect you and believe you my friend.
[13:09.210 --> 13:10.510]  You're not trying to get one over on me.
[13:10.510 --> 13:12.010]  You're not trying to get anything from me.
[13:12.010 --> 13:13.930]  You actually give to me on Patreon.
[13:13.930 --> 13:16.090]  So I believe you fully trust in you.
[13:16.090 --> 13:17.930]  I believe that you are a veteran.
[13:17.930 --> 13:20.070]  That is great advice, great information.
[13:20.070 --> 13:21.770]  We may use that in the future.
[13:21.770 --> 13:26.690]  I think when my veteran friend Keith talks to vets, he can tell.
[13:26.690 --> 13:30.650]  Just like when a surfer talks to a surfer, a grower talks to a grower, a drummer talks
[13:30.650 --> 13:33.390]  to a drummer, some stuff you just can't fake.
[13:33.390 --> 13:36.210]  So I think we will catch on eventually.
[13:37.010 --> 13:39.970]  If somebody needs to lie to us that fucking bad to get a light and they're going to say
[13:39.970 --> 13:43.890]  they're a veteran and be that shitty of a person, we'll give them a light.
[13:43.890 --> 13:47.290]  Maybe they'll still grow and they still get to be a shitty person inside and know it.
[13:47.290 --> 13:49.890]  Maybe they can grow and grow out of being a shitty person.
[13:49.890 --> 13:50.890]  But I do trust you.
[13:50.890 --> 13:51.890]  I believe you.
[13:51.890 --> 13:53.210]  And this is a good way to vet people.
[13:53.210 --> 13:55.710]  And we can throw this out there if we need to.
[13:55.710 --> 14:02.010]  It goes on to say, please give up a personal shout out dab and a fist bump and especially
[14:02.010 --> 14:07.690]  resonance hand salute to all of the military veterans and their family members.
[14:07.690 --> 14:10.490]  Yes, this is Veterans Day as I record now.
[14:10.490 --> 14:16.890]  So let's send up a big high five, a fist bump, a resonance, sticky handshake, and a big fat
[14:16.890 --> 14:22.370]  bong rip a fat joint and a big old dab of freedom for all of our veteran friends.
[14:22.370 --> 14:23.370]  Thank you guys.
[14:23.370 --> 14:24.370]  I do appreciate you.
[14:24.370 --> 14:25.370]  I've said it before.
[14:25.370 --> 14:26.450]  I'm not cut out for war.
[14:26.450 --> 14:27.730]  I don't agree with war.
[14:27.730 --> 14:29.490]  I wish that shit wouldn't happen.
[14:29.490 --> 14:32.210]  It's going to happen that I just the world that we live in.
[14:32.210 --> 14:35.850]  And I'm glad that you're out there doing it because I am not fit for that shit.
[14:35.850 --> 14:36.850]  So thank you.
[14:36.850 --> 14:37.850]  I do appreciate it.
[14:37.850 --> 14:38.850]  All right.
[14:38.850 --> 14:39.850]  Thank you to our friend, Mr.
[14:39.850 --> 14:41.370]  I think I should call you, sir.
[14:41.370 --> 14:42.370]  Right.
[14:42.370 --> 14:43.370]  That's our last veteran was a ma'am.
[14:43.370 --> 14:44.890]  So I better be careful.
[14:44.890 --> 14:46.110]  Thank you for the message.
[14:46.110 --> 14:47.410]  And thank you for your service.
[14:47.410 --> 14:49.470]  And thank you for the continued support.
[14:49.470 --> 14:52.050]  If you've got any grow questions out there, I'd love to hear back from you.
[14:52.050 --> 14:53.050]  Don't be shy.
[14:53.050 --> 14:54.530]  You're a Patreon member.
[14:54.530 --> 14:55.530]  Reach out to me on Patreon.
[14:55.530 --> 14:57.650]  All right, let's keep moving.
[14:57.650 --> 15:00.290]  Or this episode will get extremely long.
[15:00.290 --> 15:02.310]  This one comes from a familiar friend.
[15:02.310 --> 15:04.010]  This one comes from North North Terps.
[15:04.010 --> 15:05.010]  What up, North?
[15:05.010 --> 15:06.170]  Good to hear from you again, brother.
[15:06.170 --> 15:07.850]  This one says, good morning.
[15:07.850 --> 15:08.850]  Good evening.
[15:08.850 --> 15:10.330]  Any who Rasta Jeff, my man.
[15:10.330 --> 15:11.330]  How is it going?
[15:11.330 --> 15:12.330]  It's going well, bro.
[15:12.330 --> 15:13.330]  I'm hanging out here.
[15:13.330 --> 15:14.370]  Got these bright lights in front of me.
[15:14.370 --> 15:15.810]  I'm hanging out with all my friends.
[15:15.810 --> 15:17.690]  I think things are great.
[15:17.690 --> 15:19.910]  It says, I wish you well.
[15:19.910 --> 15:22.730]  Before I get to my question, I just wanted to mention that maybe you should brighten
[15:22.730 --> 15:26.330]  up your background with your new studio a little bit.
[15:26.330 --> 15:27.570]  I'm still learning the lighting.
[15:28.490 --> 15:29.490]  I'm learning a couple of things.
[15:29.490 --> 15:30.490]  We'll get it dialed in.
[15:30.490 --> 15:32.690]  I may put some plants right here and here or something.
[15:32.690 --> 15:33.690]  I may leave it spacious.
[15:33.690 --> 15:37.330]  I don't know if you've noticed, I got little mini Rasta Jeff on the desk today hanging
[15:37.330 --> 15:42.950]  out with us, trying to decorate without clutter, but thank you for the feedback.
[15:42.950 --> 15:45.130]  Let's keep going because I am getting rambly from that dab.
[15:45.130 --> 15:47.090]  It feels like it's still kicking in.
[15:47.090 --> 15:52.310]  It says, my question is, I have a couple of male arise plants leaving their vegetative
[15:52.310 --> 15:55.410]  stage that just passed some rigorous testing.
[15:55.450 --> 15:58.490]  I know I need to wait for this stem rub smells.
[15:58.490 --> 16:04.570]  Where is your number one favorite spot on the plant to get a good stem rub smell?
[16:04.570 --> 16:06.770]  Then he follows it up with this big old question.
[16:06.770 --> 16:13.250]  What are your top five traits you use to select males, both for flavor and for structure,
[16:13.250 --> 16:15.970]  peace, love, and respect?
[16:15.970 --> 16:16.970]  That's a great question.
[16:16.970 --> 16:18.810]  Let's start with the very first one.
[16:18.810 --> 16:23.890]  When we're trying to predict what a plant's going to smell like in the vegetative stage,
[16:23.890 --> 16:26.810]  it is very common just to give that stem a rub.
[16:26.810 --> 16:31.130]  Now, keep in mind that stem rub is not going to tell you what the plants are going to smell
[16:31.130 --> 16:33.850]  like in flower in the finished stage.
[16:33.850 --> 16:37.010]  It's going to give you a good hint of some of the aromas available.
[16:37.010 --> 16:38.810]  I know what I'm looking for in veg.
[16:38.810 --> 16:44.410]  I know what those veg flavors translate to and convert to later down the line in flower.
[16:44.410 --> 16:47.650]  I like a male plant that kind of smells like puke.
[16:47.650 --> 16:53.570]  I know that sounds disgusting, but the male plants that have a mothball and vomit sort
[16:53.570 --> 16:59.050]  of aroma always put out amazing terpenes once they pollinate something and that stuff
[16:59.050 --> 17:00.570]  flowers.
[17:00.570 --> 17:04.610]  That's like a very good starting ingredient, mothballs and puke.
[17:04.610 --> 17:09.570]  It may sound disgusting to you now, but when you get some cannabis that smells and or tastes
[17:09.570 --> 17:12.130]  like mothballs and puke, you're going to be ecstatic.
[17:12.130 --> 17:13.130]  You're going to love the flavor.
[17:13.130 --> 17:18.810]  The aromas are going to be tremendous and thick and heavy, and the buzz will be delightful.
[17:18.810 --> 17:24.530]  That is something I really enjoy is the vomit, mothball, sort of a bar trash can, fermented
[17:24.530 --> 17:26.210]  funk sort of an aroma.
[17:26.210 --> 17:28.530]  I like that in a male stem rub.
[17:28.530 --> 17:30.290]  When and where do I rub?
[17:30.290 --> 17:31.890]  Rub everywhere and rub often.
[17:31.890 --> 17:35.090]  I get in there and violate that bitch's space.
[17:35.090 --> 17:36.090]  That's my plant.
[17:36.090 --> 17:37.090]  I can touch wherever I want.
[17:37.090 --> 17:41.410]  I start down low, give it a little rub, smell the fingers, use another hand, give it another
[17:41.410 --> 17:44.910]  rub in another spot, smell your fingers, rub your hands on your pants and act like you're
[17:44.910 --> 17:47.170]  getting all that smell away.
[17:47.170 --> 17:50.490]  Rub them again, see if they smell like pants, then fucking rub that stem somewhere else
[17:50.490 --> 17:51.490]  and give it a smell.
[17:51.490 --> 17:53.290]  I get all over that fucking plant.
[17:53.290 --> 17:54.290]  She's mine.
[17:54.290 --> 17:55.290]  I grew it.
[17:55.290 --> 17:56.290]  I bred it.
[17:56.290 --> 17:57.290]  I can violate the fuck out of it.
[17:57.290 --> 17:59.890]  I get in there and touch it all over the place to see what it smells like.
[17:59.890 --> 18:03.330]  Sometimes I'll pull off a big leaf and just squish that leaf around in my fingers, see
[18:03.330 --> 18:04.970]  what kind of smells I get there.
[18:04.970 --> 18:06.770]  I like to get in there and smell the shit out of them.
[18:06.770 --> 18:10.010]  So all over the place for stem rubs, dude.
[18:10.010 --> 18:14.410]  Start low, go up higher, smell the leaves, smell that shit, smell the essence of that
[18:14.410 --> 18:15.410]  plant.
[18:15.410 --> 18:16.410]  That's your baby girl.
[18:16.650 --> 18:18.210]  Go out there and enjoy it the best you can.
[18:18.210 --> 18:23.490]  Now let's talk about five traits that I may look for when selecting a male plant.
[18:23.490 --> 18:27.810]  That's a very good question to ask a breeder with a very prolific male plant who's been
[18:27.810 --> 18:30.850]  becoming very popular lately in the breeding scene.
[18:30.850 --> 18:34.410]  Things that I look for when it comes to breeding from a male.
[18:34.410 --> 18:35.410]  Vigor.
[18:35.410 --> 18:38.290]  I don't want some slow, shitty, wispy growing plant.
[18:38.290 --> 18:41.130]  When I plant those plants, I want to watch that seedling go.
[18:41.130 --> 18:45.090]  I do not want the most vigorous, fastest growing plant.
[18:45.090 --> 18:48.010]  That is usually, that one is too much male.
[18:48.010 --> 18:50.390]  It's going to have too much male dominance in the cross.
[18:50.390 --> 18:54.810]  It's like if you just took this one male and crossed it to anything, everything else you
[18:54.810 --> 18:56.770]  cross it to is going to come out like that male.
[18:56.770 --> 18:59.610]  You're going to make a bunch of out crosses that are that male.
[18:59.610 --> 19:03.170]  The idea is to find a male that complements all of the females you cross it to.
[19:03.170 --> 19:07.930]  So I don't want that first tall male, but I want one that's got a lot of vigor to it,
[19:07.930 --> 19:09.490]  nice, good growth.
[19:09.490 --> 19:13.530]  Just not the run, not the slow, wispy, shitty one, not the one we're all waiting on.
[19:13.530 --> 19:14.530]  We don't want that one.
[19:14.530 --> 19:16.050]  We want a good, vigorous plant.
[19:16.050 --> 19:17.850]  So that's number one, vigor.
[19:17.850 --> 19:20.370]  Then I look for shape and structure.
[19:20.370 --> 19:21.610]  What is the shape of the plant?
[19:21.610 --> 19:23.170]  What is the structure of the plant?
[19:23.170 --> 19:25.090]  Can the branches hold themselves up?
[19:25.090 --> 19:28.090]  Does it make a big, thick stock and nice, robust branches?
[19:28.090 --> 19:31.970]  Or does it make a wispy, shitty middle stock and then try to branch out real crazy?
[19:31.970 --> 19:33.370]  Does it branch evenly?
[19:33.370 --> 19:36.130]  Does it honestly, you've got to have your goal in mind.
[19:36.130 --> 19:39.670]  That's something I've got written down here toward the end, but the shape and structure
[19:39.670 --> 19:41.570]  are all about your goal.
[19:41.610 --> 19:45.050]  If you want a plant that you're going to be able to scrog out real well, you might want
[19:45.050 --> 19:48.810]  one that you could top and makes a lot of nice branching that are all the same length.
[19:48.810 --> 19:52.330]  If you're the kind of guy that doesn't do scrogging and you do the trees with the pole
[19:52.330 --> 19:56.330]  in the middle, with a monocropping, with a monopole, maybe you want those sativa style
[19:56.330 --> 20:00.610]  plants to grow long and skinny and just long, skinny branches up the top.
[20:00.610 --> 20:04.170]  Maybe, maybe you want a short, squatty indica plant.
[20:04.170 --> 20:05.750]  That's all about your goal.
[20:05.750 --> 20:08.210]  That's like if you want to make chocolate, you got to put some chocolate in there.
[20:08.210 --> 20:11.050]  If you want to make some something else, I'm not a cook, so I don't even know where to
[20:11.050 --> 20:14.210]  go with this, but if you want chocolate in it, you got to have chocolate in the mix.
[20:14.210 --> 20:16.830]  If you want vanilla in it, you got to have vanilla in the mix.
[20:16.830 --> 20:18.210]  That's just how the male plant works.
[20:18.210 --> 20:19.550]  So you need vigor.
[20:19.550 --> 20:21.890]  You need a good structure and a good shape.
[20:21.890 --> 20:26.810]  The structure and the shape are going to be a lot of what goes into your offspring.
[20:26.810 --> 20:28.770]  So get a good structure and a good shape.
[20:28.770 --> 20:30.090]  Look at leaf size.
[20:30.090 --> 20:31.770]  That's going to tell you a lot also.
[20:31.770 --> 20:33.490]  I also look for aroma.
[20:33.490 --> 20:38.330]  I mentioned that I like that bar trash can, mothballs, dirty feet, all kinds of funky
[20:38.330 --> 20:39.330]  disgustingness.
[20:39.330 --> 20:43.930]  I like those aromas that always translates into a good stinky offspring.
[20:43.930 --> 20:46.890]  The progeny will smell gross and good.
[20:46.890 --> 20:51.570]  You'll get that funky mothball puke aroma with whatever you're crossing it with.
[20:51.570 --> 20:55.290]  So my arise male has like a funky, cushy sweetness.
[20:55.290 --> 20:57.210]  When you rub the stem, it's like sweet vomit.
[20:57.210 --> 20:59.730]  It's like somebody had too much cheesecake and beer and threw up.
[20:59.730 --> 21:01.370]  That's really what it smells like to me.
[21:01.370 --> 21:02.370]  It's fucking delicious.
[21:02.370 --> 21:04.630]  Strawberry cheesecake and vomit.
[21:04.630 --> 21:05.630]  Maybe bubble gum in there.
[21:05.630 --> 21:06.630]  Give it a little smell.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.410]  You're like, that's fucking disgusting.
[21:08.490 --> 21:12.170]  And then you cross it with a plant like platinum tangy, which smells like just straight oranges
[21:12.170 --> 21:15.130]  and it comes off like gassy oranges and it's so beautiful.
[21:15.130 --> 21:18.050]  So I like that flavor and aroma.
[21:18.050 --> 21:21.930]  Another thing I really look for when I'm picking male plants is flowering time.
[21:21.930 --> 21:26.090]  A lot of people don't grow a male plant out past two or three weeks because they go into
[21:26.090 --> 21:28.130]  panic mode and got to get rid of it.
[21:28.130 --> 21:31.770]  Even some breeders never get to see their male plants past week four.
[21:31.770 --> 21:32.850]  I've posted pictures.
[21:32.850 --> 21:37.930]  I've got pictures of several male plants in rooms that are past weeks nine and 10, maybe
[21:37.970 --> 21:39.210]  into week 11.
[21:39.210 --> 21:41.610]  I really like to see what these plants do.
[21:41.610 --> 21:45.210]  I need to know how long it takes them to get into full flower.
[21:45.210 --> 21:47.730]  How long are they going to continue to flower?
[21:47.730 --> 21:51.230]  What do they look like if you flower them for a really long time?
[21:51.230 --> 21:54.530]  If I let them go for a long time, do I see any problems?
[21:54.530 --> 21:55.690]  I want them to flower out.
[21:55.690 --> 21:57.290]  I want them to produce pollen.
[21:57.290 --> 22:00.630]  I want to keep the leaves nice and healthy all the way through their life.
[22:00.630 --> 22:01.630]  Do those male planters.
[22:01.630 --> 22:06.950]  Another thing, are they susceptible or resistant to bugs and mildew?
[22:06.970 --> 22:10.590]  If I've got powdery mildew or spider mites in one area, I'll take that male plant over
[22:10.590 --> 22:13.950]  there and see how that male plant reacts to those things.
[22:13.950 --> 22:16.150]  I've got to abuse my male plants.
[22:16.150 --> 22:20.150]  Vigor, structure, aroma, flower time.
[22:20.150 --> 22:23.950]  I don't want the first males to flower and show me that they're males.
[22:23.950 --> 22:27.910]  That one that's super hyper vigorous, hyper dominant, hyper ready to just be like, I'm
[22:27.910 --> 22:29.830]  a boy, let's pollinate shit.
[22:29.830 --> 22:31.550]  He's a little bit too dominant.
[22:31.550 --> 22:33.790]  I don't want that much testosterone in my mix.
[22:33.790 --> 22:36.150]  He's just going to make everybody else just a bunch of meatheads.
[22:36.350 --> 22:37.830]  He's going to dominate the mix.
[22:37.830 --> 22:38.830]  Not what I need.
[22:38.830 --> 22:42.430]  So I want the one, if I have 10 seeds, I talk about this a lot.
[22:42.430 --> 22:47.350]  If I have 10 seeds, hypothetically, 10 regular seeds, hypothetically, five will be males,
[22:47.350 --> 22:48.350]  five will be girls.
[22:48.350 --> 22:49.590]  Let's get rid of those five girls.
[22:49.590 --> 22:50.590]  They can go to your garden.
[22:50.590 --> 22:52.970]  You get the girls, I'll grow the boys this time.
[22:52.970 --> 22:57.070]  That first plant that shows me it's a male will probably get cold because he's got too
[22:57.070 --> 22:59.190]  much male energy to the grow.
[22:59.190 --> 23:02.510]  I don't want him in there spreading all that male gene back in there.
[23:02.510 --> 23:06.050]  I want to make a new hybrid, not just reproductions of this male.
[23:06.950 --> 23:08.090]  So we get rid of that first guy.
[23:08.090 --> 23:09.490]  Second guy might get a chance.
[23:09.490 --> 23:11.530]  That third and fourth guy is usually where I go.
[23:11.530 --> 23:12.970]  The fifth one is slow.
[23:12.970 --> 23:13.970]  He's lagging.
[23:13.970 --> 23:14.970]  He gets cold.
[23:14.970 --> 23:16.930]  Two, three, and four are the candidates.
[23:16.930 --> 23:19.970]  Usually number three and four are the ones I choose.
[23:19.970 --> 23:23.730]  I've got a good track record for choosing males, so I think I've got a good criteria
[23:23.730 --> 23:25.850]  and scenario for picking my boys.
[23:25.850 --> 23:30.650]  So I don't want the one that is too vigorous right out of the gate, but I want one that
[23:30.650 --> 23:35.930]  goes into flower and starts producing pollen at a reasonable time, around day 21, 25, 11,
[23:35.930 --> 23:39.090]  12, and if I want to get a lot of pollen coming out around day 32, I really want him
[23:39.090 --> 23:40.090]  going.
[23:40.090 --> 23:43.810]  Then I want to see how he goes, how long until he reaches that full flower, then how long
[23:43.810 --> 23:45.850]  until he stops producing pollen.
[23:45.850 --> 23:49.090]  As a breeder making a lot of seeds, that's very important to me.
[23:49.090 --> 23:54.250]  Now another thing I really like to find in a male plant is trichomes.
[23:54.250 --> 23:58.970]  If I see trichome and resin development on a male plant early in flower, that is a breeding
[23:58.970 --> 23:59.970]  candidate.
[23:59.970 --> 24:02.970]  That means it is going to pass trichomes onto the females.
[24:02.970 --> 24:04.590]  The females naturally make trichomes.
[24:04.630 --> 24:09.070]  If your males are making trichomes too, you've got two ingredients with trichomes, lots of
[24:09.070 --> 24:11.590]  trichome production is what that means to me.
[24:11.590 --> 24:16.950]  More trichomes, more cannabinoids, more cannabinoids, a better buzz, more desirable product.
[24:16.950 --> 24:17.950]  That's what you're going for.
[24:17.950 --> 24:20.950]  So if it's got trichomes on it, you want to breed with it.
[24:20.950 --> 24:23.950]  I know I've gone past five by now, but let's keep talking.
[24:23.950 --> 24:26.630]  Something else I really like is a good color.
[24:26.630 --> 24:28.590]  Everybody's growing, they're posting pictures.
[24:28.590 --> 24:31.390]  If a good color comes out of my male plants, that is a bonus.
[24:31.390 --> 24:35.430]  If I can get some nice fall, wintery colors in there, that is a great thing.
[24:35.430 --> 24:37.990]  Some oranges, some purple, some dark colored hues.
[24:37.990 --> 24:39.270]  That's something that is always a bonus.
[24:39.270 --> 24:41.990]  I've seen purple trichomes come out of male plants.
[24:41.990 --> 24:44.670]  I've seen male plants produce purple male flowers.
[24:44.670 --> 24:45.930]  I've seen a lot of great shit.
[24:45.930 --> 24:47.730]  So get in there and breed.
[24:47.730 --> 24:50.870]  Use a bunch of male plants, grow them, see what you like.
[24:50.870 --> 24:57.450]  Then the best way, the only real way to test those males is to germinate and grow the seeds
[24:57.450 --> 24:58.450]  you have made.
[24:58.450 --> 25:00.790]  There are a few things to test when you get to that point.
[25:00.790 --> 25:03.030]  How well do those seeds germinate?
[25:03.030 --> 25:06.910]  Put however many, if you made a hundred seeds, maybe germinate 10 of them and just see how,
[25:06.910 --> 25:08.390]  with intentions not even to grow them.
[25:08.390 --> 25:09.830]  This is just a germ test.
[25:09.830 --> 25:10.830]  Throw 10 of them.
[25:10.830 --> 25:13.590]  However you normally germinate, I do the paper towel method.
[25:13.590 --> 25:15.990]  Throw 10 in the paper towel, germinate them, count them.
[25:15.990 --> 25:20.230]  If you got seven of them, 70% germination rate, that's not super good.
[25:20.230 --> 25:21.230]  80 is good.
[25:21.230 --> 25:22.230]  90 is the best.
[25:22.230 --> 25:23.470]  100, you're fucking killing it.
[25:23.470 --> 25:24.790]  But I guess 100 is the best.
[25:24.790 --> 25:27.370]  90 is fucking way acceptable.
[25:27.370 --> 25:28.990]  See how many germinate.
[25:28.990 --> 25:30.030]  See how many duds you have.
[25:30.270 --> 25:31.270]  Then grow them out.
[25:31.270 --> 25:33.270]  I just said you don't have intentions to grow this.
[25:33.270 --> 25:34.270]  Let's fucking grow it.
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.270]  Maybe we change our mind.
[25:35.270 --> 25:36.270]  Let's grow these out.
[25:36.270 --> 25:38.470]  Then let's see if there are any hermaphrodites.
[25:38.470 --> 25:39.750]  Let's see if there are any mutants.
[25:39.750 --> 25:41.690]  Let's see if there are any fucking weirdos.
[25:41.690 --> 25:43.790]  Let's see if they even make it to the veg stage.
[25:43.790 --> 25:47.190]  Maybe they just die out and turn into duds before they get that far.
[25:47.190 --> 25:49.070]  Then let's see if there are hermaphrodites.
[25:49.070 --> 25:50.750]  Let's see if they show intersex traits.
[25:50.750 --> 25:52.630]  Maybe you've got the next fucking chem dog in there.
[25:52.630 --> 25:54.390]  Maybe you've got the new golden goat.
[25:54.390 --> 25:56.170]  Maybe you just bred the new fucking Skittles in there.
[25:56.170 --> 25:58.270]  We don't know what you've got until you grow it.
[25:58.310 --> 26:01.510]  Now, grow it in perfect conditions and see what you come up with.
[26:01.510 --> 26:05.030]  If it does well in perfect conditions, our next step is to take it to a fucked up grow
[26:05.030 --> 26:07.430]  room and grow it in there.
[26:07.430 --> 26:10.670]  Everybody has a friend who always gets a certain problem.
[26:10.670 --> 26:13.110]  We all know that that one guy always has powdery mildew.
[26:13.110 --> 26:15.710]  I know that one grow over there always has spider mites.
[26:15.710 --> 26:18.190]  This one dude always gets thrips.
[26:18.190 --> 26:21.830]  Let's take these plants to a couple of those places and find out what happens when we put
[26:21.830 --> 26:23.410]  them in a room with thrips.
[26:23.410 --> 26:25.510]  What happens when we put them near powdery mildew?
[26:25.510 --> 26:27.470]  What happens when we treat them too hot and too cold?
[26:27.670 --> 26:28.670]  How do they reply to that?
[26:28.670 --> 26:29.790]  How do they react?
[26:29.790 --> 26:33.110]  If your plants freak out right away, that is not something for market, but it may be
[26:33.110 --> 26:35.830]  something you want to grow yourself.
[26:35.830 --> 26:40.110]  Those are the ways that I check and audition and select male plants for breeding.
[26:40.110 --> 26:41.550]  I base it off of vigor.
[26:41.550 --> 26:44.190]  I base it off of the shape and the structure of the plant.
[26:44.190 --> 26:46.390]  I check out the aromas that come from that plant.
[26:46.390 --> 26:47.390]  I give it stem rubs.
[26:47.390 --> 26:48.390]  I smell the flowers.
[26:48.390 --> 26:49.390]  I let it flower out.
[26:49.390 --> 26:53.550]  Then, I pay attention to how long it takes to flower, how much pollen it produces for
[26:53.550 --> 26:54.550]  me.
[26:54.550 --> 26:59.230]  Then, I look for trichomes and colors and just anything else that may stand out.
[26:59.230 --> 27:03.950]  Being a breeder and a grower that has had access to a lot of rooms, a lot of plants,
[27:03.950 --> 27:08.150]  like when I work in commercial facilities, my numbers to grow are much expanded compared
[27:08.150 --> 27:09.990]  to a lot of other people's numbers.
[27:09.990 --> 27:11.990]  I've gotten to see a lot of male plants.
[27:11.990 --> 27:14.650]  That makes it much easier for me to select.
[27:14.650 --> 27:17.670]  If you've only got 10, one may not stand out.
[27:17.670 --> 27:22.230]  If you've got 100, one of them is going to say, I am the bad motherfucker in this group.
[27:22.230 --> 27:26.550]  I don't know what you've got to work with, but you really start seeing more opportunities,
[27:26.550 --> 27:29.150]  more standouts when you work with larger populations.
[27:29.150 --> 27:30.510]  Those outliers are more obvious.
[27:30.510 --> 27:33.390]  They become more present, more available when you work with a lot.
[27:33.390 --> 27:35.490]  I've got a lot of experience picking boys.
[27:35.490 --> 27:39.270]  Like I said before, I feel like I've got a pretty good track record at picking male plants
[27:39.270 --> 27:40.270]  for breeding.
[27:40.270 --> 27:42.870]  Again, it is all about your goal.
[27:42.870 --> 27:43.870]  What do you want to do?
[27:43.870 --> 27:46.670]  Do you want plants that are short and squat and smell like oranges?
[27:46.670 --> 27:50.230]  You may want to find a short, squatty male and a female that smells like oranges.
[27:50.230 --> 27:53.470]  Do you want plants that are tall and lanky and smell like strawberries?
[27:53.470 --> 27:56.990]  Maybe find a tall, lanky male plant and a girl that smells like strawberries.
[27:56.990 --> 27:59.790]  It's all about your overall goal.
[27:59.790 --> 28:05.750]  Most of all, have fun, grow from your heart, breed with love, and make sure that you test
[28:05.750 --> 28:08.310]  everything before you give it to anybody.
[28:08.310 --> 28:10.470]  If you're just growing it for yourself, have fun, man.
[28:10.470 --> 28:14.950]  Make a bunch of seeds, grow the shit out of them, take a lot of notes, and enjoy it.
[28:14.950 --> 28:15.950]  What are you going to do next?
[28:15.950 --> 28:18.270]  Are you going to back cross and try to lock in a trait?
[28:18.310 --> 28:21.230]  Are you going to F2 and try to stabilize some things?
[28:21.230 --> 28:22.730]  Figure out what you want to do from there.
[28:22.730 --> 28:24.270]  It's always more fun to breed.
[28:24.270 --> 28:27.470]  As soon as you start breeding, you want to breed more, then you want to breed more, and
[28:27.470 --> 28:29.510]  then you want to breed more, and then you want to grow those.
[28:29.510 --> 28:31.390]  It just turns ... Then you turn into me.
[28:31.390 --> 28:33.670]  Then you end up here.
[28:33.670 --> 28:35.510]  I want to thank you for the great message, North.
[28:35.510 --> 28:37.150]  I think I got really rambling on that one.
[28:37.150 --> 28:39.150]  I feel like I really gave you a good answer.
[28:39.150 --> 28:41.470]  I think that is all we have got for this episode.
