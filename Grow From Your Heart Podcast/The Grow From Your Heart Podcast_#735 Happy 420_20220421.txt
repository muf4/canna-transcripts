[01:48.010 --> 01:49.410]  I'm going to learn this new setup.
[01:49.410 --> 01:52.490]  I've got a new background, some new equipment, figuring things out.
[01:52.490 --> 01:53.850]  We've got to do a test episode.
[01:53.850 --> 01:55.690]  No need to waste time talking into a mic.
[01:55.690 --> 01:56.690]  I'm going to record it.
[01:56.690 --> 01:58.290]  We're going to make a podcast out of it.
[01:58.290 --> 02:00.690]  You may learn and adapt and adjust with me.
[02:00.690 --> 02:01.690]  Follow along.
[02:01.690 --> 02:03.930]  Let's hang out and learn the new room and the new gear.
[02:03.930 --> 02:04.930]  All right.
[02:04.930 --> 02:07.370]  I said this was going to be the 420 episode.
[02:07.370 --> 02:10.130]  This episode will come out actually on 421.
[02:10.130 --> 02:14.170]  So I hope everybody had a safe and joyous and successful 420.
[02:14.170 --> 02:19.810]  It seems like in the social area, the news, the things we're going to talk about, they
[02:19.810 --> 02:21.690]  have lifted the mask bans.
[02:21.690 --> 02:23.050]  Nobody's wearing a mask anymore.
[02:23.050 --> 02:24.630]  Everywhere we go, the masks are over.
[02:24.630 --> 02:28.010]  It seems like the pandemic has ended right on time for 420.
[02:28.010 --> 02:32.690]  It seems like everybody's out smoking again, taking bong rips together, taking dabs together,
[02:32.690 --> 02:33.690]  smoking joints together.
[02:33.690 --> 02:36.810]  I don't know when it happened, but it seemed like one day everybody just gave up.
[02:37.250 --> 02:38.250]  That old pandy thing was over.
[02:38.250 --> 02:39.250]  It was back to 420.
[02:39.250 --> 02:40.730]  I feel like we all got comfortable.
[02:40.730 --> 02:44.690]  They've lifted a lot of the mask mandates right on time for 420.
[02:44.690 --> 02:45.690]  That's a time to celebrate.
[02:45.690 --> 02:47.250]  I hope everybody had a safe 420.
[02:47.250 --> 02:48.490]  I hope you're responsible.
[02:48.490 --> 02:49.970]  Are you back to smoking with people?
[02:49.970 --> 02:50.970]  Are you comfortable?
[02:50.970 --> 02:52.090]  I've been dabbing with friends.
[02:52.090 --> 02:56.010]  I haven't been smoking with strangers per se, but I've definitely been dabbing and smoking
[02:56.010 --> 02:57.010]  with friends.
[02:57.010 --> 02:58.010]  Give me some feedback.
[02:58.010 --> 02:59.410]  Send me a tweet on Twitter.
[02:59.410 --> 03:02.090]  It's at GFYH podcast or send me an email.
[03:02.090 --> 03:03.570]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[03:03.570 --> 03:05.530]  Let me know where you are this 420.
[03:05.530 --> 03:06.530]  Were you smoking with people?
[03:07.250 --> 03:08.250]  Were you taking dabs?
[03:08.250 --> 03:09.250]  Are you passing blunts?
[03:09.250 --> 03:12.450]  How did you handle your health this year for 420?
[03:12.450 --> 03:13.770]  It seems like a lot of people are smoking.
[03:13.770 --> 03:14.770]  I've been a lot of places.
[03:14.770 --> 03:15.770]  There are no masks.
[03:15.770 --> 03:16.970]  It has been a great time.
[03:16.970 --> 03:22.690]  Now, let's segue into talking about something that did change for 420 this year.
[03:22.690 --> 03:28.170]  Usually in Denver, we have a 420 Freedom Rally where people gather in Civic Center Park and
[03:28.170 --> 03:29.730]  they openly consume cannabis.
[03:29.730 --> 03:35.610]  It's sort of a open, what is it, a friendly, peaceful protest and a display of we want
[03:35.690 --> 03:39.210]  to smoke cannabis openly and be peaceful and be civil people.
[03:39.210 --> 03:44.210]  Every year at 420 in Denver, April 20th, of course, we would do that in Denver, Colorado
[03:44.210 --> 03:45.770]  at Civic Center Park.
[03:45.770 --> 03:47.770]  We would get it at Civic Center Park, at the Capitol.
[03:47.770 --> 03:48.770]  I think it's Civic.
[03:48.770 --> 03:51.610]  I could be wrong with the words I'm saying with the location, but we all knew where it
[03:51.610 --> 03:52.610]  was.
[03:52.610 --> 03:55.610]  That one big spot where everybody was right at the Capitol is at Capitol Park.
[03:55.610 --> 03:56.770]  Anyway, somebody correct me.
[03:56.770 --> 03:58.370]  Give me the right location.
[03:58.370 --> 04:00.130]  I knew where to drive and where to park and how to walk there.
[04:00.130 --> 04:01.770]  I didn't remember the name of it.
[04:01.770 --> 04:06.570]  Anyhow, the point is we would all gather there often and smoke freely for 420.
[04:06.570 --> 04:07.570]  A lot of people would hang out.
[04:07.570 --> 04:09.210]  There'd be thousands of people there.
[04:09.210 --> 04:10.210]  There'd be booths there.
[04:10.210 --> 04:12.570]  There'd be people giving out water, vending drinks.
[04:12.570 --> 04:13.970]  A lot of people would give away cannabis.
[04:13.970 --> 04:14.970]  It was a good time.
[04:14.970 --> 04:16.450]  It was a good, friendly, open environment.
[04:16.450 --> 04:19.970]  There would always be a drum circle, a bunch of people smoking weed, hanging out.
[04:19.970 --> 04:21.410]  There'd be bands.
[04:21.410 --> 04:26.410]  Over the years, I've seen it get a little bit more organized and a little more corporate,
[04:26.410 --> 04:27.410]  may be the word.
[04:27.410 --> 04:31.890]  They actually built a fence around one part and built a concert inside of the fenced area
[04:31.890 --> 04:36.170]  and charged people money to get into the concert, which I thought was weird because that fence
[04:36.170 --> 04:37.810]  didn't stop the sound.
[04:37.810 --> 04:41.410]  We could still hear all of the musicians playing, but if you want to get down there into the
[04:41.410 --> 04:44.090]  concert area, you did have to pay some money to get into there.
[04:44.090 --> 04:46.190]  However, there have been some changes.
[04:46.190 --> 04:53.370]  This year, the 420 rally has been turned into the Denver 420 Festival.
[04:53.370 --> 04:55.190]  That's right, the 420 Freedom Festival.
[04:55.190 --> 04:56.810]  They built a cage around the entire thing.
[04:57.210 --> 05:00.650]  They put up fences around the entire venue, around the entire event where we would normally
[05:00.650 --> 05:05.150]  congregate freely, and they were charging a ticket price to get into that area.
[05:05.150 --> 05:08.970]  They also put out a notice saying, no cannabis consumption would be tolerated.
[05:08.970 --> 05:10.250]  Now, I know Denver.
[05:10.250 --> 05:11.250]  I know Colorado.
[05:11.250 --> 05:12.250]  I know my friends.
[05:12.250 --> 05:13.250]  I know my crew.
[05:13.250 --> 05:14.650]  I'm sure some cannabis was consumed.
[05:14.650 --> 05:16.770]  I'm sure the police were outnumbered and outdone.
[05:16.770 --> 05:21.650]  You can't stop all of us, but they were saying they were not going to allow, permit, or endorse
[05:21.650 --> 05:24.810]  any sort of cannabis consumption, trading, giving away, vending.
[05:24.810 --> 05:27.970]  It was all going to be shut down and people would be arrested.
[05:27.970 --> 05:32.550]  They also did mention that there would be, I read in one article said five, another article
[05:32.550 --> 05:36.970]  said seven beer tents available sponsored by local beer companies.
[05:36.970 --> 05:38.810]  So they've really taken a huge turn with this.
[05:38.810 --> 05:42.290]  We used to go smoke cannabis in the park for free.
[05:42.290 --> 05:44.170]  Now we've got to pay money to get in.
[05:44.170 --> 05:47.570]  We cannot smoke cannabis, but we can buy beer at the place.
[05:47.570 --> 05:49.090]  What a big turn.
[05:49.090 --> 05:50.850]  That is partially because of legalization.
[05:50.850 --> 05:53.050]  That is mostly because of legalization.
[05:53.050 --> 05:54.050]  Everything is different now.
[05:54.290 --> 05:55.290]  We've had to change the rules.
[05:55.290 --> 05:56.290]  It's gotten so popular.
[05:56.290 --> 06:01.290]  We've gotten so over consumed, overpopulated with people coming to smoke on 420 inundated
[06:01.290 --> 06:03.290]  is the word my brain was fishing for.
[06:03.290 --> 06:04.290]  Things are different now.
[06:04.290 --> 06:05.770]  So they've had to change things up.
[06:05.770 --> 06:09.970]  Pay attention in your area, in your jurisdiction, your locale.
[06:09.970 --> 06:15.170]  When you are making rules, writing proposals for legalization of cannabis in your area,
[06:15.170 --> 06:17.330]  these are the kinds of things that can happen.
[06:17.330 --> 06:21.130]  It is great to have recreational and legal cannabis here, but I wish we would have done
[06:21.130 --> 06:23.330]  several things differently.
[06:23.610 --> 06:25.810]  I wish we would have had places where we can consume.
[06:25.810 --> 06:31.610]  We've had legal cannabis here for, I'm going to say fucking over 10 years, 12, 14 ish years.
[06:31.610 --> 06:35.290]  We've had legal cannabis here, either medical or recreational cannabis.
[06:35.290 --> 06:36.290]  Approximately 14 years.
[06:36.290 --> 06:37.770]  I'm going to try to remember off the top of my head.
[06:37.770 --> 06:39.490]  We've had legal cannabis here.
[06:39.490 --> 06:41.730]  There's not been a safe place until recently.
[06:41.730 --> 06:45.610]  There have not been safe places for people to go and smoke the cannabis, which they can
[06:45.610 --> 06:47.770]  legally acquire here in Colorado.
[06:47.770 --> 06:52.010]  When you were making the rules in your area, make sure to include places that you can consume
[06:52.010 --> 06:53.010]  cannabis.
[06:53.690 --> 06:57.730]  If it's a social lounge, if it's a medicating lounge, something where people can get out
[06:57.730 --> 07:00.810]  of their car and go smoke inside somewhere safely.
[07:00.810 --> 07:03.530]  Right now, most of the legal states, you got to go smoke in your car.
[07:03.530 --> 07:05.530]  You got to go smoke somewhere shady and that's illegal.
[07:05.530 --> 07:06.970]  That's going to get you in trouble.
[07:06.970 --> 07:07.970]  Make a place.
[07:07.970 --> 07:08.970]  We used to have the canna cabinet.
[07:08.970 --> 07:11.610]  We used to have a few places, but legalization shut that down.
[07:11.610 --> 07:15.290]  A lot of the rules and laws were made to put those places out of business and prevent that
[07:15.290 --> 07:16.690]  from happening.
[07:16.690 --> 07:20.970]  When you do make those rules, try to include somewhere to consume the cannabis in your
[07:20.970 --> 07:26.850]  legalization, your legislation, your regulations, and your proposals for all of your goods,
[07:26.850 --> 07:30.370]  because we want you to be able to consume the cannabis, which we are legalizing.
[07:30.370 --> 07:31.570]  Also you want to be able to grow it.
[07:31.570 --> 07:35.450]  Make sure you can grow cannabis in your legalization proposal.
[07:35.450 --> 07:38.630]  We want home grows to be legalized.
[07:38.630 --> 07:42.050]  The other thing I would make sure to have in there is some sort of legal events.
[07:42.050 --> 07:45.290]  We want to be able to have events.
[07:45.290 --> 07:46.450]  I don't know what the feeling is.
[07:46.450 --> 07:50.890]  It feels shitty to be honest, that I can pay money to get into this concert to go see
[07:51.010 --> 07:54.650]  these bands that are playing and hang out with my friends, but I can't smoke a joint.
[07:54.650 --> 07:57.010]  But everybody around ... I don't drink alcohol.
[07:57.010 --> 08:01.090]  I choose not to drink alcohol because I cannot behave responsibly once I do drink alcohol.
[08:01.090 --> 08:02.490]  I know that about myself.
[08:02.490 --> 08:07.450]  I haven't consumed alcohol since I got my very first medical cannabis card in 2008.
[08:07.450 --> 08:08.530]  Haven't had alcohol since then.
[08:08.530 --> 08:09.530]  There's no need for it.
[08:09.530 --> 08:11.570]  I can buy and consume all the ganja that I need.
[08:11.570 --> 08:13.450]  That fixes 90% of my problems.
[08:13.450 --> 08:14.650]  Alcohol causes me problems.
[08:14.650 --> 08:18.610]  I don't drink it, but everybody around me is drinking beer, getting hammered, getting
[08:18.610 --> 08:19.610]  shit faced.
[08:19.610 --> 08:20.610]  Some of them drink responsibly.
[08:21.330 --> 08:22.330]  Some drink excessively.
[08:22.330 --> 08:25.850]  There's the full range, but I'm seeing lots of different types of behavior stem from the
[08:25.850 --> 08:26.850]  alcohol.
[08:26.850 --> 08:30.210]  I can't reach in my pocket and smoke a bowl without checking every direction and see if
[08:30.210 --> 08:33.970]  there's a cop or a security guard around me because I'll go to jail for getting stoned.
[08:33.970 --> 08:35.650]  We all know I'm not going to make the argument.
[08:35.650 --> 08:39.090]  We try to leave, try to chill out in an event the drunk guy gets in a fight, the stoned
[08:39.090 --> 08:40.090]  guy wants nachos.
[08:40.090 --> 08:41.090]  We're not going to go there.
[08:41.090 --> 08:45.490]  But legalization put us in this position where I can only go in there and consume alcohol,
[08:45.490 --> 08:49.370]  all of the alcohol which I can afford, which is probably like 12 bucks a cup or something,
[08:49.410 --> 08:52.490]  but I can't smoke any weed in the 420 festival.
[08:52.490 --> 08:53.970]  What kind of bullshit is that?
[08:53.970 --> 08:55.410]  So be careful is what I'm saying.
[08:55.410 --> 08:58.770]  When you do write these rules, propose these rules, if you're one of the people that is
[08:58.770 --> 09:03.970]  advocating, fighting for cannabis in your area, make sure you include somewhere to consume
[09:03.970 --> 09:09.130]  the cannabis and also make some sort of provisions, regulations, rules, amendments to where we
[09:09.130 --> 09:13.770]  can have some sort of parties, gatherings, festivals where we can legally consume cannabis.
[09:13.770 --> 09:18.250]  What we've done here in Colorado is it makes it really hard for the illegal establishments
[09:18.250 --> 09:23.170]  to participate in any of the events because they have to illegally bring product, they
[09:23.170 --> 09:24.490]  have to illegally display it.
[09:24.490 --> 09:25.810]  It makes a big shit show.
[09:25.810 --> 09:28.770]  So all of the events now are kind of smaller than they used to be.
[09:28.770 --> 09:30.810]  They're low key, they're a little bit more private.
[09:30.810 --> 09:33.970]  We can't advertise like we would like to because that will set us up to get in trouble.
[09:33.970 --> 09:36.570]  We have to be very secretive until the day of the event.
[09:36.570 --> 09:37.570]  We can be like, it's here.
[09:37.570 --> 09:40.690]  That way it limits the opportunity for us to get in trouble.
[09:40.690 --> 09:45.890]  So to recap on all that, make rules so that you can consume the cannabis somewhere, some
[09:45.890 --> 09:50.730]  sort of cannabis lounge, the dab lounge, the smoke lounge, the church of ganja, whatever
[09:50.730 --> 09:54.770]  you want to make it, make sure there's somewhere in your community area jurisdiction which
[09:54.770 --> 09:59.610]  you reside over for your legalization amendments and movements to where we can smoke some cannabis
[09:59.610 --> 10:00.610]  there.
[10:00.610 --> 10:04.090]  Also make sure everybody can grow the cannabis they need to supply for themselves.
[10:04.090 --> 10:08.290]  Then also try to make some sort of rules to where we can have freedom with our cannabis
[10:08.290 --> 10:13.010]  festivals, gatherings, festivals, events, parties, to where the companies that we're giving our
[10:13.010 --> 10:17.170]  money to every week, every month at the dispensary can throw parties and have us back.
[10:17.170 --> 10:20.810]  They can throw on a concert and get Snoop and Wiz and they can actually put products
[10:20.810 --> 10:22.690]  out for us and let us go.
[10:22.690 --> 10:26.210]  I should be able to buy, when I get in line to get my nachos, I should also be able to
[10:26.210 --> 10:29.610]  get a couple of joints or get a dab or something like that.
[10:29.610 --> 10:33.650]  Everybody in the other line is getting a mixed drink, a fucking margarita, a hard lemonade
[10:33.650 --> 10:35.330]  or a $12 beer.
[10:35.330 --> 10:38.530]  Why can't I just buy a joint from the guy at the counter right here, just get a pre-roll?
[10:38.530 --> 10:41.270]  It's probably not going to be a real good pre-roll, but it's better than not being able
[10:41.270 --> 10:42.810]  to do it at all.
[10:43.610 --> 10:48.170]  Or maybe some edibles, maybe sell me 25 milligram edibles at the concert so we can get lit up.
[10:48.170 --> 10:52.970]  Speaking of edibles, I'm going to do a Patreon only episode where I'm going to eat some edibles.
[10:52.970 --> 10:54.490]  Stay tuned and look forward to that one.
[10:54.490 --> 10:55.850]  All right, I'm stoned obviously.
[10:55.850 --> 10:58.130]  I've been smoking some, what was it?
[10:58.130 --> 11:01.130]  It's the Garlic Banger Alive Rosin from Green Dot Labs.
[11:01.130 --> 11:02.730]  That may be one of my favorite concentrates.
[11:02.730 --> 11:04.490]  I did say it was rosin.
[11:04.490 --> 11:05.490]  I know that's crazy.
[11:05.490 --> 11:07.090]  It's really delicious, gets me high as shit.
[11:07.090 --> 11:11.770]  So make sure that you get consumption rules, homegrown rules, event rules.
[11:11.770 --> 11:15.850]  Make sure the rules are what you want them because we kind of pushed a lot of great shit
[11:15.850 --> 11:18.170]  out of the industry when we made a lot of rules.
[11:18.170 --> 11:22.590]  I think it was SB1280 that really messed up a lot of things here in Colorado.
[11:22.590 --> 11:23.970]  We should have seen it coming.
[11:23.970 --> 11:26.050]  We should have had more people on our side.
[11:26.050 --> 11:27.130]  We should have voted against that.
[11:27.130 --> 11:29.310]  We should have made more awareness.
[11:29.310 --> 11:30.430]  People didn't even see it coming.
[11:30.430 --> 11:31.650]  People didn't even know about it.
[11:31.650 --> 11:36.130]  So pay attention for things like that if you are responsible for the legalization movements
[11:36.130 --> 11:37.130]  in your area.
[11:37.130 --> 11:40.330]  All right, I feel like I've rambled on for several minutes about that part.
[11:40.330 --> 11:42.490]  I did say this was going to be a quick show to test the equipment.
[11:42.490 --> 11:45.250]  I do have a couple of more topics I'd like to cover.
[11:45.250 --> 11:48.290]  There are going to be some Discord server updates.
[11:48.290 --> 11:52.530]  I apologize if you have felt uncomfortable on the Discord server, if you've had problems
[11:52.530 --> 11:56.490]  logging in, if you've been booted from the server accidentally or on purpose.
[11:56.490 --> 11:58.130]  There have been some changes in the Discord.
[11:58.130 --> 11:59.650]  There will be some updates.
[11:59.650 --> 12:01.850]  You may have to find the new Discord servers.
[12:01.850 --> 12:05.090]  There are two servers, the IRE Genetics, IRE Army Community.
[12:05.090 --> 12:07.810]  I'm not sure what we titled the new server page.
[12:07.810 --> 12:11.050]  And then there's also Rostagefs Secret Stash.
[12:11.050 --> 12:13.890]  Do your best to find both of those servers.
[12:13.890 --> 12:14.890]  We'll all be there hanging out.
[12:14.890 --> 12:16.610]  You'll know when you're on the right one.
[12:16.610 --> 12:19.090]  The old one will be phased out very soon.
[12:19.090 --> 12:25.290]  The new one will be updated and totally correct, moderated, managed, and I'll be there more.
[12:25.290 --> 12:27.610]  I wasn't on the older Discord enough.
[12:27.610 --> 12:28.690]  Some things got away from us.
[12:28.690 --> 12:30.330]  We had to regroup, rebuild.
[12:30.330 --> 12:31.530]  I do apologize.
[12:31.530 --> 12:35.090]  We will be back better and stronger than ever before.
[12:35.090 --> 12:36.090]  Stay tuned, you guys.
[12:36.090 --> 12:37.530]  The new Discord will be popping up.
[12:37.530 --> 12:42.490]  Hopefully right around the same time as this episode if we timed it correctly.
[12:42.490 --> 12:44.730]  Another thing I should mention, where were we?
[12:44.730 --> 12:46.010]  I'm working on Patreon content.
[12:46.010 --> 12:49.530]  I think I just mentioned that I was going to do a Patreon episode where I'm going to
[12:49.530 --> 12:51.130]  eat some edibles.
[12:51.130 --> 12:53.210]  I'm going to try to record that if all things go well.
[12:53.210 --> 12:56.010]  I do have a guest invited to come over here in a few hours.
[12:56.010 --> 12:59.170]  We'll record that, try to get that up to you this month on Patreon.
[12:59.170 --> 13:00.890]  If not, it will be up early, early next month.
[13:00.890 --> 13:03.130]  I do promise that episode is coming.
[13:03.370 --> 13:08.410]  It depends on if my partner in crime can make it over here to eat edibles with me on this
[13:08.410 --> 13:09.410]  show.
[13:09.410 --> 13:12.330]  Another thing I should talk about is I'm slowly restocking all the vendors.
[13:12.330 --> 13:13.690]  I get a lot of messages.
[13:13.690 --> 13:19.770]  Of course, I am also the sole proprietor, the head breeder, the HMFC of iRegenetics
[13:19.770 --> 13:21.330]  Premium Seeds.
[13:21.330 --> 13:26.330]  A lot of people are messaging me and asking me, where are the seed restocks?
[13:26.330 --> 13:27.330]  You've got to be patient.
[13:27.330 --> 13:30.130]  It is just me mainly packing up beans.
[13:30.130 --> 13:31.130]  I get them packed.
[13:31.130 --> 13:32.970]  Allegedly, they get to the vendors.
[13:33.010 --> 13:35.770]  Then the vendors do have to take time to check them in.
[13:35.770 --> 13:38.050]  They've got to inventory count them.
[13:38.050 --> 13:40.090]  Then they've got to add them to the website.
[13:40.090 --> 13:41.930]  Then you are able to purchase them.
[13:41.930 --> 13:44.650]  Keep in mind that there are a lot of people trying to buy seeds.
[13:44.650 --> 13:47.130]  A lot of these companies are smaller than they do appear.
[13:47.130 --> 13:48.130]  iRegenetics is me.
[13:48.130 --> 13:49.970]  90% of the company is me.
[13:49.970 --> 13:53.970]  I do have a few helping hands occasionally, some small packing stuff.
[13:53.970 --> 13:57.130]  You guys know that Clint's helping out and there's some stuff like that happening.
[13:57.130 --> 13:58.130]  Most of it is me.
[13:58.130 --> 13:59.130]  I'm overwhelmed.
[13:59.130 --> 14:00.130]  I'm overloaded.
[14:00.130 --> 14:01.130]  I'm doing my best to get the seeds to the vendors.
[14:01.530 --> 14:03.130]  Then they've got to get them.
[14:03.130 --> 14:06.890]  They've probably got one person that works for them that is receiving seeds from multiple
[14:06.890 --> 14:07.890]  breeders.
[14:07.890 --> 14:11.250]  They've got to count all the packs in, inventory them, put them on the website, make sure everything
[14:11.250 --> 14:12.250]  is legit.
[14:12.250 --> 14:14.690]  There's a lot to running a business in the back end that we may not see.
[14:14.690 --> 14:16.930]  So please be patient with the vendors.
[14:16.930 --> 14:19.010]  I did say that I'm restocking.
[14:19.010 --> 14:22.690]  When I said that, you guys went crazy, started harassing, messaging the vendors.
[14:22.690 --> 14:23.850]  I appreciate that.
[14:23.850 --> 14:24.850]  Keep doing that.
[14:24.850 --> 14:28.530]  But your ravenous hounds, give them a couple of minutes to get the products checked in.
[14:28.530 --> 14:29.630]  They'll put them on the website.
[14:29.630 --> 14:32.470]  We don't withhold product on purpose.
[14:32.470 --> 14:33.830]  We're in business to do business.
[14:33.830 --> 14:36.110]  We don't do any business by withholding product.
[14:36.110 --> 14:37.510]  So that's not how commerce would work.
[14:37.510 --> 14:39.150]  So we do want to get them out to you.
[14:39.150 --> 14:40.590]  Just give us time.
[14:40.590 --> 14:42.710]  Understand that some of the companies are not as big as they look.
[14:42.710 --> 14:46.990]  We do have a large presence, but there are small numbers of manpower and women power
[14:46.990 --> 14:50.270]  and non-binary power in a lot of these companies.
[14:50.270 --> 14:51.270]  The future is weird.
[14:51.270 --> 14:52.270]  You got to say a lot of weird shit.
[14:52.270 --> 14:53.270]  I'm going to clear my throat.
[14:53.270 --> 14:54.270]  We'll keep moving.
[14:54.270 --> 14:55.270]  I'm going to edit this part out.
[14:55.270 --> 14:56.270]  All right.
[14:56.270 --> 14:58.810]  I do have one more very important order of business to cover before we start wrapping
[14:58.990 --> 15:01.690]  up this episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[15:01.690 --> 15:07.370]  I want to send a big hug, a big fist bump, just a sincere love you bro to my buddy, Grass
[15:07.370 --> 15:08.370]  Tester.
[15:08.370 --> 15:11.690]  We don't need to advertise Grass Tester's business, but he's having a struggle and I
[15:11.690 --> 15:13.890]  want him to know that he's not alone.
[15:13.890 --> 15:14.890]  I'm with you, bro.
[15:14.890 --> 15:15.970]  The entire army is with you.
[15:15.970 --> 15:17.450]  The Discord crew is with you.
[15:17.450 --> 15:18.450]  We got your back.
[15:18.450 --> 15:19.530]  We fucking love you, bro.
[15:19.530 --> 15:22.290]  Big shout out to my buddy, Grass Tester, also known as Jazz.
[15:22.290 --> 15:23.290]  Keep your head up, bro.
[15:23.290 --> 15:25.170]  If I can do anything, message me directly.
[15:25.170 --> 15:26.170]  Nothing but love.
[15:26.170 --> 15:27.170]  Big fist bump, bro.
[15:27.170 --> 15:29.370]  I'm not going to air your business, but just know you are loved.
[15:29.370 --> 15:31.010]  I wanted to make sure to give you a shout out on the show.
[15:31.010 --> 15:32.010]  All right.
[15:32.010 --> 15:33.010]  Where do we go from there?
[15:33.010 --> 15:34.010]  Let's wrap up the podcast.
[15:34.010 --> 15:35.530]  Let's end this while it is still good.
[15:35.530 --> 15:39.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[15:39.650 --> 15:43.410]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I do want
[15:43.410 --> 15:46.650]  to thank you once again for listening to another quick episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[15:46.650 --> 15:47.650]  podcast.
[15:47.650 --> 15:50.130]  I do look forward to your feedback on this episode.
[15:50.130 --> 15:51.250]  Be gentle with me.
[15:51.250 --> 15:53.690]  This is the first time running this setup.
[15:53.690 --> 15:54.690]  I've got to figure it out.
[15:54.690 --> 15:55.690]  So let me know what you think.
[15:55.690 --> 15:59.530]  Send me your questions, corrections, comments, concerns, constructive criticism, positive
[15:59.530 --> 16:01.530]  feedback, or let me know what I'm screwing up.
[16:01.530 --> 16:05.010]  The email address, of course, is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[16:05.010 --> 16:06.010]  Don't be shy.
[16:06.010 --> 16:07.010]  Don't hurt my feelings.
[16:07.010 --> 16:08.010]  I can take it.
[16:08.010 --> 16:14.010]  Also, make sure you support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[16:14.010 --> 16:15.050]  heart.
[16:15.050 --> 16:19.290]  Anything else you could possibly need will be on the website at ieregenetics.com.
[16:19.290 --> 16:20.290]  Check it out.
[16:20.290 --> 16:21.290]  Give it a visit.
[16:21.290 --> 16:23.290]  Tap in is what I think all the cool kids say.
[16:23.290 --> 16:24.930]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[16:24.930 --> 16:27.330]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[16:27.330 --> 16:29.490]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[16:29.490 --> 16:31.610]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[16:31.610 --> 16:34.530]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Trollin.
[16:34.530 --> 16:38.010]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
