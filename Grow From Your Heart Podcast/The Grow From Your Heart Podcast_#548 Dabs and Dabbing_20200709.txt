[01:03.330 --> 01:07.530]  intro tune. I love it. Just the right tempo. It's got a great vibe to it. I'm really digging
[01:07.530 --> 01:11.990]  the feel of that for the start of the show. That one may stick around. I will play more
[01:11.990 --> 01:16.810]  musical submissions as the episodes progress. I want to stay on track on this episode because
[01:16.810 --> 01:21.530]  I have got a lot of ground to cover. I do like to start the show by talking about what
[01:21.530 --> 01:26.730]  I'm smoking. I am still smoking through this jar of Garlic Grove Live Batter from Green
[01:26.730 --> 01:32.790]  Dot Labs. Again, it is a blend of GMO cookies and LOAF2. On the package, the flavor is described
[01:32.790 --> 01:38.530]  as General So, Garlic, and Orange Soda. I said I completely agree with that on the last
[01:38.530 --> 01:42.630]  episode. I also mentioned that this should have a warning label on it that it has got
[01:42.630 --> 01:46.770]  a punch in the face. It's like a jack-in-the-box. I feel like when I unscrew this lid, it just
[01:46.770 --> 01:50.730]  a fist should come out and just punch me right in the face, but also give me a hug.
[01:50.730 --> 01:54.090]  It's like the most pleasant punch in the face you could ever imagine. Well, I've got the
[01:54.090 --> 01:58.270]  jar open. I'll show you. Beautiful color. I like the way the light shines and reflects
[01:58.270 --> 02:02.010]  off of there. A little bit of sheen, a little shimmer, a really delicious concentrate. It
[02:02.010 --> 02:07.330]  is like a thick cheesecake batter or maybe a real thick butter. I'm really digging the
[02:07.330 --> 02:12.310]  texture and flavor and consistency of this. It dabs very nicely. Obviously, it's got me
[02:12.310 --> 02:16.490]  nice and rambly. I did get another jar of this. I had to visit the dispensary to get
[02:16.490 --> 02:21.210]  some supplies. This one does have a potency label on the back of this one. It says it
[02:21.210 --> 02:29.210]  contains 68.24% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. Big shout out to our friends at Green
[02:29.210 --> 02:36.530]  Dot Labs for the tremendous Garlic Grove Live Batter. This is the part of the show where
[02:36.530 --> 02:41.990]  we do a shout out to our friends in the 710 Club. How appropriate this is the 710 episode.
[02:41.990 --> 02:45.930]  Big dab, big fist bump to everybody in the 710 Club. Those are the folks who support
[02:45.930 --> 02:50.730]  us on Patreon at the 710 level or above. Let's start off giving a shout out to the
[02:50.730 --> 02:55.170]  710 Club with the captain and commander of the 710 Club. How about a big thank you shout
[02:55.170 --> 02:59.170]  out to my buddy Lemur Priest. Bro, thank you. Looking you straight in the face, giving you
[02:59.170 --> 03:03.530]  a big thank you, bro. Big fist bump. I appreciate it. Much respect. Let's follow that up with
[03:03.530 --> 03:07.130]  the big heartfelt thank you to our friend North North Terps. Thank you, bro. I love
[03:07.130 --> 03:11.050]  reading your messages. Thank you for the support. Also, I want to send a thank you shout out
[03:11.050 --> 03:15.490]  to Steven Smith. Bro, you kick ass just because your name is the same name as one of my favorite
[03:15.490 --> 03:20.970]  drummers. You get points in my book for that. Also, today I had the honor of meeting Giant
[03:20.970 --> 03:25.550]  Mike and the Dabbing Queen. Really cool people. Got to spend a couple of moments with them.
[03:25.550 --> 03:30.330]  We properly socially distance allegedly. That was a good time. Good to meet you guys. I
[03:30.330 --> 03:34.250]  hope we hang out in the future when all the social distancing and stuff is cleaned up
[03:34.250 --> 03:37.530]  and we can hang out and actually take some dabs and spend more than a couple of minutes
[03:37.530 --> 03:41.290]  together hanging out just meeting each other. You guys, it was a pleasure. It was an honor.
[03:41.290 --> 03:44.570]  Look forward to next time. Shout out to Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen. Let's move forward
[03:44.650 --> 03:48.410]  with a big giant shout out to Kurt Z. Kurt, I know who you are, bro. Thank you for all
[03:48.410 --> 03:52.450]  the continued support. I see you out there, bro. Thank you. I've always got a big thank
[03:52.450 --> 03:56.250]  you shout out for my buddy OG Purple Thumb. Keep killing it, bro. I love your photos.
[03:56.250 --> 04:00.810]  Also, I've got a giant thank you for Grow Man Stan. Thank you. Big shout out. Big fist
[04:00.810 --> 04:05.090]  bump. Also, how about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast? Thank you. Shout out to Totally
[04:05.090 --> 04:09.330]  White Tops. Thank you for all the love and support. I also need to send a thank you to
[04:09.330 --> 04:14.810]  Pac Northwest Dan. Thank you. And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow
[04:14.810 --> 04:20.370]  From Your Heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out and a fist bump to my friend Sean 23.
[04:20.370 --> 04:24.870]  Big thank you. I do appreciate all the support you guys. Again, if you're not already supporting

[05:08.650 --> 05:14.530]  You guys contributed heavily to making today's episode a success and possible. I've got a
[05:14.530 --> 05:20.610]  large plethora of concentrates on the table. That was probably paid for by Patreon contributions.
[05:20.610 --> 05:24.690]  I don't know that I would have gone and done this if I didn't get a very generous Patreon
[05:24.690 --> 05:28.450]  contribution at the start of the month. So that helped you guys out. I'm going to use
[05:28.450 --> 05:33.610]  that funding toward the show. So it paid off immediately. I've got a plethora of concentrates
[05:33.610 --> 05:37.650]  here. I'll try to go through each jar or at least most of the jars. And I will post a
[05:37.650 --> 05:43.530]  picture of this table on the Grow From Your Heart podcast Instagram page. I'm going to
[05:43.530 --> 05:47.610]  write that down to remember that. I'll try to do it as I'm editing the show, but post
[05:47.610 --> 05:52.330]  IG, to IG, that's going to be a better note. So I know what that means. But then you can
[05:52.330 --> 06:02.450]  see what this table looks like. It is beautiful chaos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17,
[06:02.450 --> 06:07.810]  17 jars, but many of them are 4 gram jars. And then we've got a 10 gram jar of Terp sauce
[06:07.810 --> 06:12.010]  here. There's a nice collection of concentrates on the table. Then we're going to top off
[06:12.010 --> 06:16.090]  that with a whole bunch of equipment. We'll talk about rigs and dabbers, maybe a little
[06:16.090 --> 06:20.970]  bit of evolution of equipment. But let me keep myself on track here. Patreon. Thank
[06:20.970 --> 06:24.790]  you guys. Where are we going from there? It is the 710 episode. This episode will come
[06:24.790 --> 06:31.810]  out on 7-9. That is close enough. We'll dab at 7-9. I'm dabbing every day. But 7-10 is
[06:31.810 --> 06:37.230]  officially dab day, dab time. You can take a dab whenever you want, guys. But let's talk
[06:37.230 --> 06:43.330]  about what is 7-10? What does 7-10 mean? Why am I celebrating 7-10? Why am I excited about
[06:43.330 --> 06:48.850]  it? In short, 7-10 is the new 420. Look at that dreadlock here, sneaking out. Got to
[06:48.850 --> 06:53.930]  tuck that one back in there for the camera. 7-10 is the new 420, you guys. If you look
[06:53.930 --> 06:57.890]  at the number 7-10, write the number 7-10 on a piece of paper and turn it upside down,
[06:57.890 --> 07:03.290]  it says oil. So what do we do at 7-10? We smoke oil. What kind of oil? We smoke hash
[07:03.290 --> 07:11.110]  oil. What kind of hash oil? Butane honey oil, BHO, butane processed honey oil. I'm not going
[07:11.110 --> 07:15.090]  to go too far, but in this episode, I'm not going to teach you how to make concentrates.
[07:15.090 --> 07:19.170]  That is not something I will cover. I'm not a concentrate maker. I am a concentrate consumer,
[07:19.170 --> 07:23.950]  a concentrate connoisseur, if you will. We're not going to talk too much about making it.
[07:23.950 --> 07:28.910]  Butane honey oil is made with butane. I know that sounds dangerous if you don't know a lot
[07:28.910 --> 07:32.990]  about the concentrates. The butane is easily removed. We've figured out systems to remove
[07:32.990 --> 07:38.510]  the concentrate. We'll talk more about that. But butane honey oil is what BHO stands for.
[07:38.510 --> 07:43.990]  That's where the oil in 7-10 comes from. You turn 7-10 upside down, it says oil. We're smoking
[07:43.990 --> 07:49.350]  butane honey oil, BHO. If you've seen BHO, round those letters. Some of this may be old
[07:49.350 --> 07:53.350]  info for some of you, but I want to start at the beginning. We're going to do the evolution here.
[07:53.350 --> 08:00.470]  This is page one of the book. So you've got BHO. We're smoking butane hash oil. That's the oil in 7-10.
[08:00.470 --> 08:09.030]  I really believe that the phrase 7-10 was coined by Task Rock of highly educated titanium. I'm going
[08:09.030 --> 08:13.990]  to give Task most of the credit. I know he was on a chat with other folks. I believe the guy
[08:13.990 --> 08:18.390]  from Healthstone Glass was in there, and I'm not sure who else. If you were in there, please send
[08:18.390 --> 08:22.230]  me a message. I'll give you some credit for being in the room. But I've heard the story from Task
[08:22.230 --> 08:27.190]  and him and another guy. Maybe other guys were in a chat. They wanted to upgrade 4-20. They're like,
[08:27.190 --> 08:31.510]  Bro, we've moved on from smoking weed. We're smoking oil all the time. Let's come up with a
[08:31.510 --> 08:38.070]  new word. And Task was like, 7-10, bro. So 7-10 became the new 4-20. At 4-20, all the stoners like
[08:38.070 --> 08:43.510]  to pack a bowl and smoke a bowl. Smoke a bowl at 4-20. Celebrate 4-20 all day long. On 7-10,
[08:43.510 --> 08:49.910]  we're going to get dabbed the fuck out. DTFO, you guys. Dabbed the fuck out on 7-10. So shout out
[08:49.910 --> 08:56.550]  to TaskRock for coining the phrase 7-10. Shout out to the 7-10 movement. There's a lot of people
[08:56.550 --> 09:00.550]  behind all the oil movement and the concentrate movement. I was lucky and blessed to be here in
[09:00.550 --> 09:05.110]  Colorado where a lot of it happened. I was at the, I think they say at ground zero, at the
[09:05.110 --> 09:10.070]  forefront of the evolution of a lot of this stuff. So I've been around since a lot of it started.
[09:11.510 --> 09:16.470]  So I think I want to talk about some of the different types of concentrates and different
[09:16.470 --> 09:21.430]  ways of dabbing. And then we'll talk about some of the gear that you need for a proper dab sesh.
[09:21.430 --> 09:27.430]  So in short, dab time is 7-10 and this episode is all about 7-10. So let's talk about some of
[09:27.430 --> 09:34.870]  the concentrates we're going to smoke on 7-10. To the best of my memory, most of it started with
[09:34.870 --> 09:39.030]  old school shatter. I'm going to bust out some shatter here. I've got a fresh gram of shatter.
[09:39.030 --> 09:43.910]  I picked this up at Apothecary Farms. It's still sealed up. It's brand new. This is a gram of
[09:43.910 --> 09:49.830]  Crescendo OG Shatter. Shout out to our friend Colin Gordon at Ethos Collective at Ethos Genetics
[09:49.830 --> 09:53.910]  for the, what did he breed here? The Crescendo. I'm pretty sure that comes from Colin.
[09:53.910 --> 09:59.670]  I'm gonna try to bust this open. They make them childproof. It is Wookie proof. I may need scissors
[09:59.670 --> 10:04.070]  you guys. I got teeth though. There we go. I got that shit open. All right, we're gonna bust out
[10:04.070 --> 10:08.550]  some shatter. Show you what some shatter looks like. This is the container that it comes in.
[10:08.550 --> 10:13.670]  It's got all these state regulations printed on the side here. It's got a bunch of just store
[10:13.670 --> 10:24.070]  stuff, retail stuff. Potency 66.7% THC and zero CBD for 77.9% total cannabinoids. So there's THC
[10:24.070 --> 10:30.070]  and something else in there. Maybe THCV, THCA. They didn't list it very well, but there's other
[10:30.070 --> 10:34.710]  stuff in there. Other cannabinoids in there. It says there may be long-term physical or mental
[10:34.710 --> 10:39.190]  health risks from using, from use of marijuana, including additional risk for women who are,
[10:39.190 --> 10:43.830]  or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding. Use of marijuana may impair your ability to drive a
[10:43.830 --> 10:49.430]  car or operate machinery. This product was produced without regulatory oversight for health,
[10:49.430 --> 10:55.190]  safety, or efficacy. This is an inhaled product. So it's just got all the regular safety shit on
[10:55.190 --> 10:59.030]  the back there that it needs to have. Got the fancy Apothecary logo on here. Shout out to our
[10:59.110 --> 11:04.230]  friends at Apothecary Farms. So this is Shatter, you guys. I'm going to show you, it comes in
[11:04.230 --> 11:09.350]  customized. This is just, it's like parchment paper, basically. Don't use wax paper for your
[11:09.350 --> 11:13.830]  Shatter. The wax comes off. You want parchment paper. Get the good shit, get the organic shit,
[11:13.830 --> 11:17.510]  or get your custom made stuff with your logo, like our friends here at Apothecary. So I'm
[11:17.510 --> 11:21.590]  going to unfold this. I'm going to try not to drop it while I show it to the camera. Sometimes it
[11:21.590 --> 11:26.390]  sticks to the paper. Sometimes it slides off the paper. This one's stuck. So this is what Shatter
[11:26.470 --> 11:33.030]  looks like. It'll be in different colors and consistencies, but mainly this is what you're
[11:33.030 --> 11:37.430]  going to find. This is close to the right color. This is the right color. It may be lighter or
[11:37.430 --> 11:41.270]  darker in color. That's not a huge deal. This is right in the middle. This is kind of the color
[11:41.270 --> 11:44.390]  that you'd expect. A little bit lighter would be better, a little bit darker, I wouldn't have bought
[11:44.390 --> 11:50.390]  it, but I got this for the show. This is Shatter. If it were not warm, this is a warm day in
[11:50.390 --> 11:56.630]  Colorado. So right now it's more bendy than it should be. But if this were warm, when I did that
[11:56.630 --> 12:00.070]  move, it would just break. It would just be a piece of Shatter. That's where it got the name
[12:00.070 --> 12:06.790]  Shatter. So this was kind of the start of the BHO oil movement. This is the shit that got it all
[12:06.790 --> 12:13.030]  going. I could probably dab this whole thing right now and not be amazingly high. I would not
[12:13.030 --> 12:17.750]  recommend you do that, but I have moved on to, we're going to show the evolution and show you
[12:17.750 --> 12:22.470]  where we are now. But this is old school. I don't buy this stuff anymore, but this is available.
[12:22.470 --> 12:28.630]  This is Shatter. I should show you, if you were going to dab some Shatter, I've got a dab tool
[12:28.630 --> 12:31.910]  here. I'm just going to show you what the end of it looks like without any concentrate on it.
[12:31.910 --> 12:37.430]  I'll put a little dab on here. This is what I would recommend for a beginner dabber, and you're
[12:37.430 --> 12:43.590]  going to think I'm crazy because it is a tiny dab. That may be more than enough to make somebody
[12:43.590 --> 12:49.590]  cough and get them really high. You guys, what I put on the dabber is less than 0.1 of a gram
[12:49.590 --> 12:53.670]  of a dab. You can't tell that I took anything off the dab. I could still give this gram to Matt or
[12:53.670 --> 12:57.910]  Mike and say, here's a gram, and they're thinking they got a full gram. You'll never notice that
[12:57.910 --> 13:03.670]  is missing. So if you're looking at the video, that little tiny piece is what I would recommend
[13:03.670 --> 13:09.990]  you take a dab of. It is smaller than a grain of rice. If that's your first dab, do that. You can
[13:09.990 --> 13:15.990]  always take a bigger dab. You can't un-dab the dab that you just took. When you take your first dab,
[13:15.990 --> 13:22.150]  it may be tremendous. You may get a heavy feeling in your lungs. You may get the sweats. You may
[13:22.150 --> 13:26.550]  cough. You should cough. I like the cough that comes with the dab, that rush, that redness,
[13:26.550 --> 13:31.910]  your face turns red, you get the sweats, you cough a little bit. Sometimes that'll give some people a
[13:31.910 --> 13:36.630]  panic attack. Write it, bro. That's what you're there for. That's what I'm there for. I just took
[13:36.630 --> 13:40.870]  a giant dab. I paid money for it. I just fucked myself up. I want to feel something. I don't want
[13:40.870 --> 13:46.390]  to take a dab and feel the same. That's a ripoff. So take a little dab, and if you don't get what
[13:46.390 --> 13:50.390]  you want from that first dab, take another one. And if you don't get what you want from that one,
[13:50.390 --> 13:55.350]  take a bigger dab next time. But don't go in like I do and take a monster dab on the first rip.
[13:55.350 --> 14:00.230]  That's my advice. So this is Shatter. This is what basically started the game. I showed you how big
[14:00.230 --> 14:03.750]  of a dab that you should take. I'll show you how big of a dab I would take. I'm not trying to show
[14:03.750 --> 14:07.990]  off. I've just been at this for a while. I'll show you how I go in on some Shatter. I would probably
[14:07.990 --> 14:13.190]  do at least that big of a dab right there. That's how I would get the party started for some Shatter.
[14:13.190 --> 14:17.750]  So probably do the whole gram and cough a couple of times if that's what we had to do.
[14:17.750 --> 14:22.310]  But I think I'm going to pass this on to a couple of friends who smoke more Shatter than me. Now,
[14:22.310 --> 14:29.830]  the next thing I want to talk about is also Shatter. But this is the new fad in Shatter technology.
[14:29.830 --> 14:33.830]  This is a gram of strawberry milk Shatter. This is one gram. I don't know who made the
[14:33.830 --> 14:42.230]  strawberry milk. I apologize. The potency label says it is 82.1% total THC and 93.4% total
[14:42.230 --> 14:49.190]  cannabinoids. So we do have more potency in this one on the label than we do in the other Shatter.
[14:49.190 --> 14:56.390]  But this one is what is known as CRC Shatter. So it has been color. It is color, remediation,
[14:56.390 --> 15:01.830]  column. And I think the C could also be chromatography because I am not a concentrate
[15:01.830 --> 15:06.950]  maker. I am not a scientist. This is not my area of expertise what I'm talking about right now.
[15:07.510 --> 15:15.110]  I posted to social media, please teach me about CRC. I got a lot of feedback. A lot of it,
[15:15.110 --> 15:18.710]  I'm trying to open this pack. There we go. A lot of it was straight up bickering and
[15:18.710 --> 15:23.990]  bullshit between concentrate makers and smokers. From what I understand,
[15:24.230 --> 15:29.670]  color remediated concentrate or color remediation columns or color remediation
[15:29.670 --> 15:33.830]  chromatography, all of those were typed in my responses in social media when I asked to be
[15:33.830 --> 15:42.390]  taught about it. Basically, there are two sides of the opinionated forum here. Some people say
[15:42.390 --> 15:48.630]  that it is polished turds. They think that the color remediation was required because the starting
[15:48.870 --> 15:53.750]  product was not up to par. So when they ran the material, it came out dark or kind of funky or
[15:53.750 --> 15:59.350]  smelled bad or tasted weird. So then it is color remediated to take out all of the crap. Then it
[15:59.350 --> 16:04.310]  comes out different and it is cleaner. Now, there are two sides, two schools of thought here. Like
[16:04.310 --> 16:08.710]  I said, some people think that that is amazing. You're cleaning up all product, you're making it
[16:08.710 --> 16:13.910]  safer, you're making it cleaner for patients and consumers, which is a good thing. A lot of people
[16:14.870 --> 16:21.510]  also say that that is allowing growers and producers to create a subpar product because
[16:21.510 --> 16:29.350]  we're just going to clean it up anyway. So there's a very fine line in crowds on how people feel
[16:29.350 --> 16:33.990]  about the CRC. Excuse me for the throat clearing. I took a lot of dabs. I'm not even going to edit
[16:33.990 --> 16:39.110]  that. This is a real 710 show. I'm going to show you, oh, this is pretty. I just now opened this.
[16:39.110 --> 16:42.470]  I should have showed you more of the opening. I'll refold. That's all I did. I pulled the package
[16:42.470 --> 16:47.430]  out of the main package. Then I've got the parchment, the customized apothecary parchment
[16:47.430 --> 16:52.870]  here. I've got to be careful when I show this to the camera because this is more shatter-like and
[16:52.870 --> 16:56.790]  it is also falling out of the parchment because of the way that I'm tipping it. I'm going to pick
[16:56.790 --> 17:00.710]  it up with my bare hand. That's a bad idea. It's going to melt and stick, but this is for the show's
[17:00.710 --> 17:05.510]  case. That's what the CRC looks like. If you're looking at that on the podcast, it is on the
[17:05.510 --> 17:12.070]  video. It's much more clear than the non-remediated product. I'll show it again. Then I will take a
[17:12.070 --> 17:17.910]  photo side by side and post that. Here's the non-remediated and then here's the remediated
[17:17.910 --> 17:23.110]  product. You can obviously see color differences. This one's bright, bright yellow. This one has got
[17:23.110 --> 17:27.750]  an amber color. Nothing wrong with the amber shatter. Back in the day, the amber shatter is
[17:27.750 --> 17:32.710]  what we all wanted. It's what we were going for. Now, we've got this CRC. Like I said, you guys,
[17:32.710 --> 17:38.470]  there are two camps. People love it or hate it. It is polished turds in some people's mind. It is
[17:38.470 --> 17:43.990]  also a really clean and refined product in some people's mind. I am not going to go too far down
[17:43.990 --> 17:48.550]  that rabbit hole. I will take a dab of it after this show or maybe later in the episode. I may
[17:48.550 --> 17:54.070]  leave the video running. I want to develop an opinion on this myself. I should smell it. I
[17:54.070 --> 17:57.990]  should smell it because I hear a lot about it doesn't have any smell or flavor or it all smells
[17:57.990 --> 18:03.590]  and tastes the same. I'm going to lean away from the mic and smell it. There's no smell. I don't
[18:03.590 --> 18:08.390]  smell shit. It smells like the paper and my fingers. That's all it smells like. That is this
[18:08.390 --> 18:13.350]  CRC. You guys, I will leave the decision making up to you. I'm not trying to be biased here. I'm
[18:13.350 --> 18:17.990]  telling you that there are two camps. Some people say that it's great because we can clean up a
[18:17.990 --> 18:22.550]  product. We can take things out that got left in in the extraction process. What may have gotten
[18:22.550 --> 18:27.350]  left in, I'm not sure what it can take out, but I read chlorophyll. I also read pesticides. They
[18:27.350 --> 18:32.710]  argued that it could take out pesticides. I'm not sure, you guys. There was a lot of bickering and
[18:32.710 --> 18:39.110]  a lot of controversy in the group when I asked about that. That is color remediated shatter.
[18:39.110 --> 18:45.590]  We started smoking shatter, then eventually appeared a product called wax. Wax happens
[18:46.710 --> 18:51.430]  when you make shatter, you want it to sit still while it purges. You put it under a heat source,
[18:51.430 --> 18:56.950]  over a heat source, you put heat underneath it or in a vacuum oven, and you let the shatter purge
[18:56.950 --> 19:02.870]  so that the residual butane comes out of it. We've learned that if you disturb the shatter
[19:02.870 --> 19:07.910]  while it's sitting there, if you whip it and put air into it, it would make a fluffier consistency.
[19:07.910 --> 19:12.390]  And that would also, in some people's mind, it was speeding up the process of getting that butane
[19:12.390 --> 19:16.790]  out of the mixture because we wanted to remove all the butane, wanted a proper purge. If you
[19:16.790 --> 19:22.470]  left butane in there, you got told you had tain soup or poop soup. But eventually, we learned how
[19:22.470 --> 19:27.430]  to whip the product. And by whipping shatter, it put air into it, and it turned it into what is
[19:27.430 --> 19:32.070]  known as a wax. I was trying to pick some of this up, but it's real crumbly. I'll try to get this
[19:32.070 --> 19:35.510]  big chunk. You shouldn't touch your concentrates with your fingers, you guys, but this is for
[19:35.510 --> 19:41.190]  science. So here we go. This is wax. You can see it's a little bit dark in color. It's not as clear
[19:41.190 --> 19:46.150]  as the remediated stuff, not quite as dark as the shatter. It's got a little bit of air in it.
[19:46.150 --> 19:51.110]  I liked, back in the day, I really liked clean shatter. I thought the clean shatter hit well
[19:51.110 --> 19:57.190]  and tasted good. I liked some wax. It depends on how it was made and what the consistency was and
[19:57.190 --> 20:06.230]  what it tasted like. Back in the day, we had not mastered the art of removing the turps and
[20:06.230 --> 20:10.070]  processing things properly and getting the, not removing the turps, I apologize, removing the
[20:10.070 --> 20:14.550]  butane, preserving the turps. My brain was tripping. I had so many thoughts. We weren't pros at it yet.
[20:14.550 --> 20:20.390]  So it didn't taste amazing yet. Proper wax was fucking delicious. So something I think I should
[20:20.390 --> 20:26.470]  note about this wax and the shatter is these are made from dried products. These can be made from
[20:26.470 --> 20:33.110]  dried buds or dried trim. Once you harvest and you cut off the sugar leaf, that dry stuff can be used
[20:33.110 --> 20:39.990]  to make wax and the shatter. So we got through wax, we got through shatter. I'll show you, this is a
[20:39.990 --> 20:44.230]  white widow wax. I should give a shout out to the people I got. It's white widow wax from Apothecary.
[20:44.230 --> 20:51.750]  The label says 64.1% THC and 76.5% total cannabinoids. I'll show you in the jar without my
[20:51.750 --> 20:56.230]  grubby fingers on it so you can see what it looks like. I'll turn up the spill it. There we go.
[20:56.230 --> 21:04.550]  That is the wax for you. So it went shatter and wax and then we started seeing another product
[21:04.550 --> 21:11.190]  called batter. Batter was kind of between the shatter and the wax. It was softer and it didn't
[21:11.190 --> 21:16.790]  wax up like the wax but it didn't shatter like shatter and it looked more, I'm going to show you
[21:16.790 --> 21:21.750]  just so you can get a view of it. It looks like just a little dollop of cheesecake batter or cake
[21:21.750 --> 21:26.710]  batter or maybe some thick butter in the bottom of the jar. You can see if I turn the jar just
[21:26.710 --> 21:30.550]  right you can see how they dolloped that right into the container. It just has like a little
[21:30.550 --> 21:34.630]  like a thing of whipped cream or something. It's got that cool little whip at the top of it, the
[21:34.630 --> 21:38.950]  tail. It's got that, it looks like a Hershey kiss in there. So that is batter. This is black water
[21:38.950 --> 21:47.830]  batter from Apothecary Farms. On the package it says 67.6% total THC and 79.9% total cannabinoids.
[21:47.830 --> 21:53.590]  I like batter. I like the batter because I feel like it expands in my lungs a little bit. I get a
[21:53.590 --> 22:00.150]  big fat dab out of a little bit of batter and I feel like it's super terpy. Most of the time terpy,
[22:00.150 --> 22:03.990]  flavorful. Terps are flavor. When I'm talking about terps I'm talking about the flavor you guys.
[22:03.990 --> 22:10.230]  I usually find the batter to be the most preserved terps of this type of concentrate that we've
[22:10.230 --> 22:16.390]  reviewed so far. So we started off with the shatter then we moved to wax. I'd show you, let's show you
[22:16.390 --> 22:21.270]  how big of a dab of the wax to do because I showed you the shatter. Just again, little tiny dab of the
[22:21.270 --> 22:27.110]  wax. I'm going to show you that that's enough wax to do a fat dab you guys. That's a big dab of wax
[22:27.110 --> 22:31.910]  right there. That's bigger than you should do. That's going to get you going. So that's the wax.
[22:31.910 --> 22:36.550]  Now I'll show you how much batter that you should dab. If you're new at dabbing, I'm going to bust
[22:36.550 --> 22:41.510]  out some of this batter. This is Blackwater Dabber from Apothecary Farms. I'm going to throw the dabber
[22:41.510 --> 22:45.190]  around just for good luck then we'll put a dab on there. I'm just going to go kind of light. I just
[22:45.190 --> 22:49.190]  want to just dip it into there. That's why they call it a dab you guys. You just need a dab.
[22:49.190 --> 22:54.070]  You don't need a fucking dollop or a glob. You just need a dab. That's enough. That's more than
[22:54.070 --> 22:58.870]  enough. Now that I hold it up to the camera, that would make Mike cough. That's enough to get Matt
[22:58.870 --> 23:04.470]  or Mike plenty stoned and they're dabbers you guys. So maybe half of that and this is again about
[23:04.470 --> 23:09.350]  the size of a piece of rice. I'm going to knock it in half. It's just hard for me to it just feels
[23:09.350 --> 23:15.430]  silly the way that I dab. It feels silly to offer somebody that much concentrate but it's about half
[23:15.430 --> 23:22.710]  of a piece of rice. That's all you got there. So that is how much of a dab I think you should do of
[23:22.710 --> 23:27.750]  wax or batter. So we've covered the first three basics. Those are the first three things that we
[23:27.750 --> 23:31.830]  kind of fell in love with that we were dabbing on that was available that were really popular
[23:31.830 --> 23:37.350]  here for dabbers that were available in stores. Then people started developing new technology.
[23:38.070 --> 23:43.270]  There was a company I talk about apothecary farms a lot. They did a little bit of pioneering in the
[23:43.270 --> 23:50.230]  industry. They came up with their own product that they called Ambrosia. Ambrosia is a blend,
[23:50.230 --> 23:56.870]  basically a blend of two different concentrates in my opinion from my experience. They made a
[23:56.870 --> 24:04.390]  product called HCFSE and that stands for high cannabinoid full spectrum extract. I'm going to
[24:04.390 --> 24:15.670]  show you some Tropicana Cookies full spectrum extract. This is 79.1% THC, 91% total cannabinoids.
[24:15.670 --> 24:18.870]  This is what we call diamonds you guys. I'm going to try to get this on the camera.
[24:19.510 --> 24:25.590]  That is diamonds, basic diamonds. Trying to move my notes out of the screen here so you guys can't
[24:25.590 --> 24:31.030]  see what's coming up next on the show. Those are diamonds. You can see that it looks they're hard.
[24:31.030 --> 24:34.630]  I'll touch them with my finger. They move around. They're not soft and squishy. I shouldn't pick
[24:34.630 --> 24:39.350]  them up but I will. That's falling apart on my fingers but that's a diamond for you.
[24:40.630 --> 24:43.910]  That's a good size diamond right there. So that's what we're talking about when we say diamonds.
[24:43.910 --> 24:49.750]  I like diamonds. Diamonds are a dabber's best friend. So those are the diamonds. Then you hear
[24:49.750 --> 24:56.870]  us talk about sauce. Diamonds and sauce. The sauce is the high terpene full spectrum extract.
[24:56.870 --> 25:01.270]  So they've made a concentrate and I don't know the science behind this. I'm not claiming to be a
[25:01.270 --> 25:07.430]  concentrate maker. I like to dab. They make a concentrate and they leave it in solution under
[25:07.430 --> 25:12.550]  pressure. That's enough details there. When they do that the diamonds sink to the bottom. The terps
[25:12.550 --> 25:16.150]  float to the top right. You got the heavy diamonds on the bottom, the liquid up top.
[25:16.150 --> 25:21.350]  So this is the terp sauce. I'm tipping this jar toward the camera the best I can.
[25:21.350 --> 25:27.590]  It is mostly liquid just pure terps. This is 10 grams of liquid terpenes. Not just liquid terps
[25:27.590 --> 25:36.790]  but is mostly terps. Let me see if there's a potency label. This is 68.2 percent THC and 79.3
[25:36.790 --> 25:41.510]  percent total cannabinoids. The rest of that is just terps you guys. This is the terp sauce from
[25:41.510 --> 25:45.670]  Apothecary Farms. I'm trying not to spill it but I want you to see down in that jar.
[25:47.510 --> 25:55.430]  It's thicker than water but not as thick as honey. Almost maple syrup. Almost as thick as a maple
[25:55.430 --> 25:59.750]  syrup. You guys I don't want to spill it but I want you to see what I got going on in there.
[25:59.750 --> 26:05.270]  So our friends at Apothecary made the HT and the HC but when they introduced these things
[26:05.270 --> 26:10.390]  they had mixed them together in what they were considering the perfect homogenized blend and
[26:10.390 --> 26:17.670]  they call it Ambrosia. And what I'm going to show you here is the Lost Tribe Ambrosia and that is
[26:17.670 --> 26:22.230]  diamonds in sauce together. You can see the diamonds in there and you can see the sauce in
[26:22.230 --> 26:28.790]  there. Now what I like about this when you dab the diamonds by themselves they are very high in THC.
[26:29.590 --> 26:35.350]  Excuse that. They are very very high in THC but they're a little bit harsh and they don't have a
[26:35.350 --> 26:43.910]  lot of flavor and the high is not perfectly desirable. So in my opinion the THC diamonds,
[26:43.910 --> 26:49.270]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract, the THC diamonds, that type of concentrate makes you
[26:49.270 --> 26:54.310]  go up. The THC makes your high go straight up like a firework. Fourth of July just happened
[26:54.310 --> 26:58.950]  makes your brain go up like a firework. Then I think the turps are what give your fireworks
[26:58.950 --> 27:02.950]  colors. That decides if you're going to get paranoid, if you're going to get giggles,
[27:02.950 --> 27:07.350]  if you're going to get fucking munchies, if you're going to get a panic attack. So the THC
[27:07.350 --> 27:12.310]  is going to make you get high and the terpenes, whichever terpenes are present in your concentrate
[27:12.310 --> 27:16.550]  are what are going to dictate the type of high you experience. And those that buzz could be
[27:16.550 --> 27:21.030]  different for different mind types, different chemistries, different people, just different
[27:21.030 --> 27:25.190]  different people get different effects. I really like limonene. I think limonene is good for my
[27:25.190 --> 27:32.470]  brain. Limonene gives some people a fucking panic attack. I enjoy it. So that is the Ambrosia.
[27:32.470 --> 27:37.910]  That is high terpene full spectrum extract. And that is high terpene full spectrum extract. I
[27:37.910 --> 27:43.990]  don't know if I told you that was a lemon G, high terpene full lemon OG. It smells like lemons and
[27:43.990 --> 27:49.510]  gas. It's like lemon pledge, lemon pledge and a skunk punched you right in the face. It's delicious.
[27:49.510 --> 27:54.390]  Then we've got the Tropicana cookies, HC diamonds. And then we've got the Lost Tribe Ambrosia,
[27:54.390 --> 28:00.310]  which is the blend, the homogenized blend of both together. So we've gotten through the shatter,
[28:00.310 --> 28:07.110]  the batter, the wax, we've gotten all the way up to the turps and the Ambrosia is something that
[28:07.670 --> 28:13.510]  a lot of people are into. This is not my thing, not my flavor, not for me. I'm not hating it. I've
[28:13.510 --> 28:18.150]  just decided that I like other things better. This one makes my lungs feel heavy. I really like
[28:18.150 --> 28:26.390]  batters. But when I smoke the SHO, which stands for solventless honey oil, it is really heavy to
[28:26.470 --> 28:33.190]  my lungs. This was a Jam Band premium Ambrosia SHO from Apothecary Farms. I'm going to show you
[28:33.190 --> 28:37.190]  what it looks like, then we'll talk about it. You can see that we did smoke most of it just because
[28:37.190 --> 28:41.590]  it's not that bad. I mean, I paid for it and want to get high. So we smoked it. But again, it looks
[28:41.590 --> 28:46.550]  like a little dollop of cheesecake. It's a little lighter in color than all of the other concentrates
[28:46.550 --> 28:55.270]  like this that I showed you. But this came from rosin. This was pressed into rosin. Flowers were
[28:55.270 --> 29:00.390]  pressed into rosin and then that rosin was made into bubble hash. They made bubble hash out of
[29:00.390 --> 29:05.190]  the pressed rosin. So there's a big process to this. This is one of the more expensive products
[29:05.190 --> 29:08.870]  on the market right now. The solventless concentrates are definitely more expensive.
[29:08.870 --> 29:13.830]  They're very sought after. There's a big crew of concentrate heads that just loves solventless
[29:13.830 --> 29:18.550]  concentrate. They will pay the premium and they're after it all the time. So this sort of stuff sells
[29:18.550 --> 29:25.670]  out. This one is 82.1% total cannabinoids. I love it. I get really blazed from it. It's a heavy high.
[29:25.670 --> 29:29.110]  You feel like you just want to sit down and chill the fuck out. It's a video game concentrate,
[29:29.830 --> 29:35.270]  but that's not what I'm going for. And it's also really, really heavy on my lungs.
[29:36.150 --> 29:40.550]  Something else I should talk about. Rosin. I just said that that came from pressed rosin.
[29:40.550 --> 29:46.390]  Let's talk about original rosin. What I've got here is a piece of parchment paper. What's inside
[29:46.390 --> 29:53.110]  is rosin. I'm going to show this to you. This was made with no chemicals, no water. This was made
[29:53.110 --> 29:58.230]  with heat and pressure. So I've got a friend who takes buds and there are several different
[29:58.230 --> 30:01.750]  methods of doing this. I've seen it done with a hair straightener. I've seen it done with a
[30:01.750 --> 30:06.790]  hydraulic press. I've seen it done with everything in between. Shout out to my buddy Pedro for making
[30:06.790 --> 30:13.270]  the best fucking rosin that I have ever smoked. This came from a local friend. So they take a bud
[30:13.270 --> 30:17.430]  and they put it in something with heat. Imagine the hair straightener. It's got two hot plates.
[30:17.430 --> 30:21.430]  You press it together. Whatever goes in the middle there is going to get squished and get hot. Put a
[30:21.430 --> 30:25.670]  bunch of pressure on it, heat it up to just the right temperature, fold up a bud and parchment
[30:25.670 --> 30:31.830]  paper and put it in between there and press it. This is what comes out. We call this hash rosin,
[30:31.830 --> 30:37.590]  just flower rosin. I'm sorry. This is flower rosin. This came out from a squished and heated
[30:37.590 --> 30:41.750]  bud. It just dripped right out into the parchment paper. You guys, I don't make the product, but I
[30:41.750 --> 30:46.230]  do know what it looks like and I do know how to smoke it. I am kind of excited about this. It is
[30:46.230 --> 30:50.710]  not my favorite concentrate, but to see people able to make their own concentrates at home without
[30:50.710 --> 30:55.830]  any dangerous products because making BHO and all this other stuff, you can put yourself in danger.
[30:55.830 --> 31:00.310]  This was done with hot, with just fucking a hot fucking hair straightener or maybe a hydraulic
[31:00.310 --> 31:04.550]  press. So you're just squishing buds and some, there's a lot of tech to it. If you're going to
[31:04.550 --> 31:09.510]  make your rosin, make sure you do the research. Don't take my advice, but this can be done at home
[31:09.510 --> 31:14.150]  for very affordable prices. You just need to squish nugs. You need nugs and a squish source.
[31:15.030 --> 31:20.390]  So they pressed it and there it is. Rosin is not my favorite because most of the time I think it
[31:20.390 --> 31:25.190]  tastes like a burnt popsicle stick or a popsicle stick or burnt popcorn and it just doesn't dab
[31:25.190 --> 31:29.830]  right for me. It's not what I like. A lot of people love it. Don't let me sway you because
[31:29.830 --> 31:34.470]  I don't like it. You may fucking love it. So that's how much rosin I would dab if I were
[31:34.470 --> 31:38.790]  going to dab a dab of rosin. That's all you need if you're a new dabber. If you're an experienced
[31:38.790 --> 31:42.630]  dabber, you know how much to take for yourself. Go in. But if you're new, I want you to go light.
[31:42.630 --> 31:46.950]  Like I said earlier, you can't un-dab the dab you just took. You got to deal with it. You got to
[31:46.950 --> 31:50.950]  cough. You got to have that panic attack. You got to do all that shit. I'm looking at my notes to
[31:50.950 --> 31:57.110]  make sure I covered all this stuff that I want to cover. Something I did not buy any of is distillate.
[31:57.750 --> 32:03.990]  Distillate is, it's distilled fucking concentrates. They make a concentrate and sometimes concentrates
[32:03.990 --> 32:08.630]  are not up to par or sometimes they want to do different things with different components of the
[32:08.630 --> 32:14.150]  concentrate. They can separate each cannabinoid, the THCA, the CBD, whatever cannabinoid you're
[32:14.150 --> 32:19.190]  looking for. They can pull it out in separate columns. Then they can take the terpenes and
[32:19.190 --> 32:25.510]  separate them into different columns. When they sell just the THCA or just the CBD in a liquid
[32:25.510 --> 32:32.070]  form after it's been distilled, that is a distillate. A lot of times we refer to that as hot dog water.
[32:32.070 --> 32:37.190]  It's quite the same as the CRC tech. People think it is polished turds. You were taking concentrate
[32:37.190 --> 32:42.070]  that was not up to par. Go ahead and distill it, clean it out, separate all the shit. Then you can
[32:42.070 --> 32:48.630]  put your own very specific blend of turps and THC into the pens, into your rigs, into your vape carts
[32:48.630 --> 32:55.350]  and you can sell that however you'd like. That is distillate. I did not buy any. It is clear and it
[32:55.350 --> 33:00.630]  looks a lot like the turp sauce that I showed you. I'm not into it. Didn't spend any money on it. I
[33:00.630 --> 33:04.950]  used to really like it. Then companies started, when it first came out, I think the companies
[33:04.950 --> 33:10.230]  were using quality material. As time went on, it got funky. It got worse. It's like the bottom of
[33:10.230 --> 33:14.950]  the barrel. We call it hot dog water now. Sorry if you're making distillate and I just shit all over
[33:14.950 --> 33:18.390]  your stuff. Hopefully you're making good stuff, but be careful with the distillate. All right.
[33:19.910 --> 33:25.670]  So most of what I showed you can be made from dry products. A lot of things have to be made
[33:25.670 --> 33:32.070]  from a fresh frozen product. I didn't go over live resin. I don't have any live resin. Live resin
[33:32.070 --> 33:37.590]  has a lot of different textures and consistencies that is made from fresh frozen concentrates. You
[33:37.590 --> 33:41.990]  have to cut down or fresh frozen plants. You have to cut down your plants, take off the big leaves,
[33:41.990 --> 33:46.630]  then freeze it. Then you run that through a butane extraction machine and it comes out
[33:46.630 --> 33:51.830]  super turpy and delicious. You get the essence of that fresh plant because heat and light destroy
[33:51.830 --> 33:55.830]  terpenes. When you cut it down and freeze it and then extract it, you've just preserved all of the
[33:55.830 --> 34:01.590]  magic and it tastes so delicious. So that is live resin. Now I'm going to show you what I believe to
[34:01.590 --> 34:07.990]  be live batter. This is batter that was made from fresh frozen plants. This is the garlic grove. I'm
[34:07.990 --> 34:12.710]  going to crack it open and show you that one again. This is the live batter from, yeah, it says live
[34:12.710 --> 34:17.030]  batter. So that means that gives me the opinion that it was made from fresh frozen plants. So
[34:17.030 --> 34:22.470]  that's the live batter. It's very similar to the non-live batter. The other batter I showed you
[34:22.470 --> 34:26.470]  may have been a frozen batter as well. They don't indicate that on their package. This one I know
[34:26.470 --> 34:31.830]  was fresh frozen. Just because I showed you the apothecary diamonds in sauce, I want to show you
[34:31.830 --> 34:38.630]  some Green Dot Labs. We call this full spectrum extract. This is the high terpene full spectrum
[34:38.630 --> 34:44.310]  extract and the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract sold together from another company.
[34:44.310 --> 34:49.030]  Instead of using the proprietary Ambrosia term at Green Dot Labs, they call it a full spectrum
[34:49.030 --> 34:54.630]  extract. We say FSE. I want to show you this one at a nice diamond in here. This is the garlic
[34:54.630 --> 34:58.710]  banger. I really love the chunky diamonds in there. You can see those diamonds. If I tip it
[34:58.710 --> 35:03.910]  too long, the terp sauce will run out. But there's the diamonds in there. That is the Green Dot Labs.
[35:03.910 --> 35:07.190]  I also want to show you this. Holy fuck, just because it's beautiful. And it's called Holy
[35:07.190 --> 35:13.030]  Fuck. Look, it really says that on the jar. Holy fuck from Green Dot Labs full spectrum extract.
[35:13.030 --> 35:18.790]  You got a really cool logo. I want to show you the concentrate. See that? That's a nice ratio
[35:18.790 --> 35:23.430]  of diamonds to sauce. So that's what the diamonds and sauce, the full spectrum extract looks like.
[35:24.390 --> 35:28.470]  I think I've showed you most of the concentrates on the table. I do have some headbanger and some
[35:28.470 --> 35:33.670]  sexy peach, but there's consistencies that you've already seen. So I think now it is time to work
[35:33.670 --> 35:39.510]  our way toward talking about the equipment that we need and use when we are dabbing. Let me read
[35:39.510 --> 35:45.750]  my list to make sure I got it all. Shatter, CRC, wax, batter, diamonds and sauce, Ambrosia, FSE,
[35:45.750 --> 35:52.470]  SHO, distillate, rosin. Yeah, we got it all, you guys. I feel secure moving on to the gear section.
[35:53.670 --> 35:58.470]  In the gear section of the podcast, I want to start by showing you what has become my favorite
[35:58.470 --> 36:03.510]  dab setup. This is nice and easy. Not super expensive. This is something everybody has
[36:03.510 --> 36:08.710]  access to. A lot of people like a really colorful, fancy rig from a glass artist that they know.
[36:08.710 --> 36:14.550]  I love that. I like a rig that I know hits like a fucking truck ran my face over. This is my
[36:14.550 --> 36:19.030]  favorite rig. It has got a big, fat, flared out mouthpiece so that when I put my mouth on it,
[36:19.030 --> 36:24.470]  it fits perfectly. My mouth goes in there instead of on the outside. It's more like I'm
[36:24.470 --> 36:30.310]  blowing a trumpet instead of sucking a peepee. It fits better. When I take a giant dab, if I've got
[36:30.310 --> 36:34.390]  a really small peepee shaped mouthpiece or something with an awkward hole in it, I get a
[36:34.390 --> 36:39.350]  bunch of concentrate built up on my lips because I take big dabs. This big flared out mouthpiece
[36:39.350 --> 36:44.230]  doesn't concentrate my dab, my smoke into one tiny spot. I really like that. It's good for a
[36:44.230 --> 36:49.190]  mustached guy. I got some sort of facial hair all the time. I like the flared out mouthpiece.
[36:49.190 --> 36:53.990]  You'll notice this rig is fairly small. This is probably three and a half inches tall in the main
[36:53.990 --> 37:00.790]  can piece. We don't need a big rig. This is not a bong. When you're smoking a bong, you want to fill
[37:00.790 --> 37:06.150]  a big section with smoke and then pull the carb so you can get all that smoke to your face. We're
[37:06.150 --> 37:09.910]  not going to carb the dab rig. You're going to put the dab on there. You're going to put a cap on it.
[37:09.910 --> 37:13.030]  You're going to spin it around and that smoke is going to go through the water to your face.
[37:13.030 --> 37:17.670]  There's no chamber to fill. There's no space. You don't need that big dab, that pull. You don't need
[37:17.670 --> 37:24.550]  that. I like a small rig. You'll notice my nail or banger of choice today is just a basic. This is
[37:24.550 --> 37:30.150]  called a banger. Just a basic banger. It's a 90 degree banger. We'll talk more about bangers in
[37:30.150 --> 37:35.190]  just a moment. This is my weapon of choice when it comes to dabbing. I heat this piece up until it's
[37:35.190 --> 37:40.310]  the desired temperature. I've got a dabber. I place the dab in here using my dabber.
[37:40.310 --> 37:44.630]  The dabber's got a hair on it. Beautiful timing. Couldn't have been better. There we go. Put the dab
[37:44.630 --> 37:48.630]  right in there. Once the dab is in there, I put a cap on it. We'll talk about the cap and what it
[37:48.630 --> 37:53.830]  does in just a moment. And then I just inhale slowly until I've got my dab. So that is my
[37:53.830 --> 37:58.630]  favorite rig right now. I like the smaller rig better. It's better than a bong in my opinion.
[37:58.630 --> 38:04.310]  I like the flared mouthpiece. Well, let's talk about the perk. I don't need a lot of water. It's
[38:04.310 --> 38:08.390]  kind of dirty in there. Sorry, I should have cleaned that. But this is reality. It's a fucking 710 show.
[38:08.390 --> 38:12.470]  I've been dabbing. I like this one. It's got a stem that goes straight down to the water. Then it splits
[38:12.470 --> 38:17.030]  off two directions. They call that a hammerhead. This is a hitman hammerhead sidecar is what this
[38:17.030 --> 38:22.230]  is known as. But that two-way perk in there gives me plenty of good filtration. Just enough to cool
[38:22.230 --> 38:26.070]  down the smoke and make it not super hot by the time it gets to my lung. I'll inhale through the
[38:26.070 --> 38:32.150]  rig and you can see the bubbles on both sides. I'm not sure how clear that comes up on the camera,
[38:32.150 --> 38:37.910]  but that is the hitman hammerhead sidecar. My rig. My weapon of choice. Let's talk more about some
[38:37.910 --> 38:43.750]  other equipment. When I first got into dabbing, the first real dab, I started by dabbing by putting
[38:43.750 --> 38:48.310]  concentrates in a bowl and smoking it in a bowl and that was a waste. It got me really high,
[38:48.310 --> 38:55.110]  but it wasn't efficient and effective. My first real dab off of a real dab rig came from Daniel
[38:55.110 --> 39:01.830]  Desai at the Broadway Wellness booth at the High Times Cannabis Cup in Denver, Colorado at the Expo,
[39:02.470 --> 39:10.070]  the endo. What was that called? Fucking Expo Mart Expo. I forget the name of the place. A little
[39:10.070 --> 39:15.190]  tiny shitty place. Not the big place, not the Denver Mart, but X Doe. It was X Doe is what I
[39:15.190 --> 39:20.070]  think the name of the place was. But shout out to Big D. He gave me my first real dab. I took that
[39:20.070 --> 39:25.350]  dab off of a device known as a skillet. I don't have a skillet anymore. Mine was donated for
[39:25.350 --> 39:31.430]  science or history. What the skillet was, it fit inside of your bong or your rig, your existing
[39:31.430 --> 39:36.710]  smoking apparatus. And it had a piece that came up out of the female part of the bowl. Wherever
[39:36.710 --> 39:40.710]  your bowl would slide into your bong, it would slide into there just like your bowl. And then
[39:40.710 --> 39:45.750]  it went straight up and then it curved down and hung upside down. It looked like an upside down
[39:45.750 --> 39:51.270]  or a right side up bell actually. The bell part flared and pointed down. Then it had a piece of
[39:52.230 --> 39:56.230]  aluminum wrap wrapped around it. It looked like a hippie made it, made you a wire wrap. And it had
[39:56.230 --> 40:02.950]  one piece that extended to underneath that bell. Then underneath that bell would go a round piece
[40:02.950 --> 40:07.990]  of titanium. And that was a skillet plate. So you'd be able to swing it up since it was on the,
[40:07.990 --> 40:13.590]  it's wrapped around the curved piece. Fuck, I'm messing this description all up. So it goes up
[40:13.590 --> 40:18.310]  and it curves straight down. So you got a fucking 180 degree angle, goes straight up, goes, does a
[40:18.310 --> 40:24.550]  U-turn, U-turn piece. At the middle of that U-turn, you would wrap the titanium fucking twine or wire.
[40:24.550 --> 40:29.590]  And then you could spin it up and down to where you could move the plate in and out from underneath
[40:29.590 --> 40:34.310]  the bell. I think that makes sense now. So you got a U-turn, the bottom of the U-turn is a bell at
[40:34.310 --> 40:39.110]  one end and it attaches to your bong at the other. I've got some resin on my finger if you see that
[40:39.110 --> 40:43.910]  in the video, just resin, don't worry. So you got your U-turn bell on one side goes into the rig on
[40:43.910 --> 40:48.870]  the other. Then they've got the skillet that swings up and down. So you can swing it up, heat it, swing
[40:48.870 --> 40:53.030]  it back down and it goes under the bell. You would swing it up and heat it long enough. Then you would
[40:53.030 --> 40:57.670]  slide it under the bell and then you'd put your dab on there. And then when the dab melts, your bell
[40:57.670 --> 41:01.750]  is basically right above it and it would just go right into there when you inhale. I think that
[41:01.750 --> 41:07.190]  makes sense. That was the original way to dab. I saw a lot of people put their dab on the skillet
[41:07.190 --> 41:12.390]  and tip the rig and the fucking dab would run right off the skillet. I saw a lot of carnage from that.
[41:12.390 --> 41:18.870]  We were heating that fucking skillet till it was glowing orange and then hitting it. We've learned
[41:18.870 --> 41:22.710]  that that is not the way to do it. We've evolved a little bit since then. So the first dabs were
[41:22.710 --> 41:27.910]  coming off of a skillet. I wish I had one here to show you. Like I said, I donated that one to history.
[41:27.910 --> 41:33.510]  But the thing we got right after that was the domed titanium nail. I'm going to take a little
[41:33.510 --> 41:45.360]  sip of this water and then I'll show you a domed titanium nail. So this rig is a little tiny rig
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.600]  from a local glass artist called Solomino Glass. Shout out to Solomon. I don't know if he's still
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.920]  around. I think he may have gone to Denver. Hope you're well bro. Haven't seen you in a minute.
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.080]  But this is a little tiny rig known as a mini rig. It's got a 14 millimeter male joint. This
[42:00.080 --> 42:07.120]  joint is a male. So you need a female dome to go on your male rig. But what we would do is we would
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.600]  put this piece in there. This is called a nail. And if you're not watching the video, I'll try to
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.800]  describe it. It kind of looks like a screw. It's got a long piece and then a top to it like a head
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.720]  of a screw. But it's also would have a nut on it and you would use that nut to adjust the height.
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.680]  So you would put the long end of the screw into the rig and adjust the nut to where the head of
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.440]  the nut is sticking out. And then you would heat it up. You would heat up the head of the screw
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.520]  part. I'm pointing at it on the video here. We would heat this part up and then we would put
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.000]  the dome over it so that your dab doesn't get away. And then you'd put your dab on the dabber
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.360]  and put your dab onto the nail through the dome. So you've got your nail would basically sit where
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.840]  your slide would go into your bong. But if it's inside of there, this goes into the hole and
[42:51.840 --> 42:57.360]  rests on that this the nut part holds it in place so it doesn't go too deep. You heat that part up.
[42:57.360 --> 43:02.560]  So now it's nice and hot. Then you place your dome over it. And then you put the dab onto the nail.
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.560]  And now the dab doesn't disappear. It doesn't just fly off into nowhere because it's got the dome.
[43:06.560 --> 43:10.720]  Then as you inhale, if you choose to, you can kind of cover the dome a little bit with your fingers
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.960]  and regulate the airflow. And we'll talk about carb capping and that stuff here in a moment.
[43:14.960 --> 43:21.120]  But that is where we evolved. We went from the swing arm skillet to the domed nail. A big shout
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.520]  out to Task Rock for the nail that he made here. I think this was called the flux nail. This is a 14
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.560]  millimeter flux nail from highly educated. Big shout out. This one is chazzed and burnt to shit.
[43:30.560 --> 43:34.320]  It's time for a new one. But I don't use this anymore. Just had it around on the shelf for a
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.040]  good experiment. So you throw this bad bitch in here, heat it up with the torch, put that on there,
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.840]  drop your dab in there, then hit it, cap it with your fingers. That is how the dabbing evolved from
[43:43.840 --> 43:50.240]  the skillet. Then I think everybody got tired of taking the dome off and losing domes and dropping
[43:50.240 --> 43:56.720]  domes and having to carry a dome around. Also, the dome would get stuck. If you would take a dab,
[43:56.720 --> 44:00.080]  and the dab would drip down a little bit, it would get fucking stuck. And you'd have to heat it up a
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.360]  little bit with your torch to get the dome off. We got tired of the domes, you guys. So that is when
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.040]  we found domeless nails. Big shout out to our friend Task Rock. Once again, highly educated
[44:11.040 --> 44:17.440]  for the domeless dab nail. This looks like a rook from a chess piece. It's got a tapered bottom.
[44:17.440 --> 44:21.840]  It's got two heat sinks so that the heat doesn't get too much to your rig. Then it has got a big
[44:21.840 --> 44:28.240]  top with a big moat type dish in there. And then it's got a cylinder down the middle. So where your
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.400]  dab doesn't fall right down the middle hole, it's got a cylindrical piece that sticks up,
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.200]  kind of a chimney. If you're watching the video, it will all make sense to you. This is a domeless
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.400]  nail. This one is a female. This one fits on the outside. It fits right over there on the
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.800]  outside of that just like the dome does. Then you would heat this part up. You'd use your dab tool
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.560]  to put your dab right in there. Then that is where the carb cap comes into play. The device
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.600]  I've got in my hand is known as a carb cap. This is from highly educated titanium also. It's got a
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.560]  couple of tips available. I like the flat tip. You can pick up some shatter. Then you put your shatter
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.840]  onto the dabber after you've heated it up. Then the carb cap fits right over the top of the domeless
[45:07.840 --> 45:12.960]  nail. I know we didn't have a dome. Now we're just using a cap, right? But what you can do, you can
[45:12.960 --> 45:18.160]  use this and turn it. It's got one hole inside of there. I'm trying to get the hole on the camera.
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.720]  There's the hole. You turn this while it's on top of the nail. That will move the oil around on that
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.120]  nail to disperse the oil better and get it to fresh heat because sometimes the nail will cool as
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.800]  the oil hits on there. If you take a big dab like I do, it will cool over time. That is a carb cap.
[45:32.800 --> 45:36.480]  We didn't have to take the dome off every time. You could scoop up your dab, heat it up, drop your
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.800]  dab on there, put the cap on it, and be ready to rock. It wasn't as much work. Very convenient.
[45:40.800 --> 45:47.200]  That was the evolution. So where do we go from domeless nails? Where am I? Where am I?
[45:47.200 --> 45:53.840]  Skillet, dome, domeless. Oh, that is where we moved into bangers and carb caps. Let me get some of
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.480]  this stuff out of my way. Try to keep myself organized and on track. Bangers and carb caps.
[45:58.480 --> 46:02.640]  These have become my favorite way to dab. I'll show you a couple of different examples. I showed
[46:02.640 --> 46:10.240]  you this one here. This is a female banger. It's got a... the hole is on the bottom. It fits onto a
[46:10.240 --> 46:16.400]  male rig. That's a female banger. That's a 14. A 14 millimeter is the size of the hole. This is a
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.080]  male banger. It's slightly stuck in the rig. I may have to apply some heat. There we go.
[46:20.080 --> 46:24.560]  That's just resin and it gets stuck. This is a male. This one goes into the hole. Does that make
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.200]  sense to you guys? The male goes into the hole. The female receives the piece. So the joint is a
[46:29.200 --> 46:35.360]  female. The nail is a male. This is a 14 millimeter banger as well. Neither one of these are very
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.280]  expensive bangers. If you want to be the guy that buys the expensive stuff, go for it. If you want
[46:39.280 --> 46:44.240]  to buy something not overpriced, go for that. Try to find something American made. That's my
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.160]  biggest recommendation. But those are your dab bangers. Where do we have to go from there? A
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.760]  bubble cap. A banger isn't a banger without a good bubble cap. So let me show you a carb cap and we'll
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.880]  talk about what a carb cap does and why we're using these things. Also, big shout out to Blissful Glass
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.120]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast dab rig. You did a wonderful job. I fucking love it.
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.080]  Thank you. Big shout out. Make sure you guys follow. I'm 99% sure that was Blissful Glass.
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.800]  Give them a follow. So a carb cap. I've talked about taking a dab. You're going to heat this up,
[47:14.800 --> 47:19.360]  drop your dab in here. We'll do that in a moment. Then you're going to put a carb cap on it. Why and
[47:19.360 --> 47:24.240]  what? What the fuck does this carb cap do? When you put the cap in here, you'll notice it restricts
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.720]  the airflow when I inhale. Watch when I inhale without it. Now watch when I inhale with it.
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.640]  You can hear and see the restricted airflow. The hole is smaller. Not as much air can get in here.
[47:35.120 --> 47:43.360]  That creates a vacuum and it creates, it requires, that's what I want, it requires less heat to make
[47:43.360 --> 47:49.920]  my dab vaporize or volatize, whatever the word is. It takes less heat to get my dab to turn into a
[47:49.920 --> 47:56.320]  vapor that I can get through the rig. So without the intense heat, I do not burn my dab off. I don't
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.240]  burn off the turps. I don't burn off the cannabinoids. I can get a little lower temperature
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.120]  and I don't burn my throat, my lungs, my esophagus. It's a smoother dab and it tastes a
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.640]  little bit, a lot better honestly when you cap it. So that's the reason of a carb cap. I'm gonna veer
[48:10.640 --> 48:16.640]  off of my notes here because I forgot to talk about cold start dabs. Some people will put their
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.160]  concentrate in the banger and then heat it up. That's acceptable as well. I like to heat the
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.400]  banger and then drop the dab in there. The reason for the cold start dab, and I didn't talk about
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.000]  inserts either. Let me make a note on this paper to talk about inserts. I skipped that.
[48:30.560 --> 48:35.840]  Inserts. Hopefully I look down and see this. Cold start dabs. Cold start dabs are cool,
[48:35.840 --> 48:40.000]  just what some people prefer. That way you don't scorch the dab. You don't fry it up.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.320]  You're actually getting it as it's heating up instead of dropping it onto a hot surface.
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.480]  Imagine if you drop something onto a scorching hot surface, you just singe it right away. If you
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.720]  bring it up to temperature and then smoke it as it reaches temperature, you get it at that perfect
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.200]  boiling or volatizing or vaporizing point. I don't know the correct term. A lot of people do
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.160]  cold start dabs. Insert dabs. I don't have my insert set up here in front of me. I should have
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.760]  grabbed that. An insert looks like a little tiny thimble. You put your concentrate in the glass
[49:07.760 --> 49:13.280]  thimble. Then you heat the banger and drop the insert into the banger and put the carb cap on it.
[49:14.240 --> 49:19.680]  This is a very similar approach as a cold start dab. You're not singeing the dab right away. It's
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.080]  like a double boiler. If you're trying to melt chocolate, if you put chocolate in a pan and turn
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.080]  up the heat, the chocolate's going to burn and stick to the pan. If you put a pan of water on
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.120]  the stove and then put your pan of chocolate inside that water, you'll slowly heat the chocolate and
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.360]  it won't burn itself and it doesn't scorch. That's the same idea as doing an insert dab.
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.320]  You're catching the dab as it heats up instead of at the scorching temperature. That's an insert
[49:42.320 --> 49:47.200]  dab. I had to make sure to include that because I did leave that out on my notes. Shout out to my
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.920]  New Mexico crew who's always killing me with those fucking insert dabs. Love you for it. But
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.400]  God, my lungs are hurting. Where are we going to go from there? Banger and bubble cap, showed you
[49:56.400 --> 50:02.160]  the male and the female banger. Now this is something fun, you guys. I've got a really fun
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.080]  device here in front of me that I may be able to move it a little bit, but I don't want to get too
[50:06.080 --> 50:13.440]  crazy. Eventually, we got tired, fucking potheads, we got lazy and got tired of heating up the dab
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.840]  nail constantly between dabs, waiting for it to cool to the right temperature. You heat it up,
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.920]  you let it cool down, then you put the dab on there, you take your dab, you set it down.
[50:21.920 --> 50:25.680]  Next guy scoops up his dab, fucking heats it, repeats it. It takes a little bit to get a couple
[50:25.680 --> 50:29.360]  of dabs in you. And if you want to have a nice dab session, you can go through a little bit of
[50:29.360 --> 50:34.480]  butane. Also, some people didn't want us using butane in some places. We were allowed to consume,
[50:34.480 --> 50:38.480]  but we couldn't have a torch. You couldn't be blasting the fucking butane torch. So that is
[50:38.480 --> 50:45.840]  where we became a fucking technologically advanced. And we got something called an e-nail.
[50:45.840 --> 50:51.200]  What I'm showing you here is a ceramic dab nail. Some dab nails were made out of ceramic. Some
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.800]  people feel that the ceramic preserves the flavor better than the titanium or the quartz. I think
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.360]  the quartz is definitely better in flavor than the titanium. That's why I liked it. It's why I switched.
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.520]  The ceramic is great, but it's not my favorite. I'm not 100% sold, but you can see that I do have
[51:07.520 --> 51:12.720]  it and I do enjoy it. It does give a nice flavor, but it takes maintenance and it will break
[51:12.720 --> 51:18.480]  eventually, I think. But this is a quality ceramic nail and a quality ceramic e-nail. Shout out to
[51:18.480 --> 51:24.160]  our friends at B-Nail. Big shout out to Ollie at B-Nails for the great hookup on the e-nail. I love
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.520]  this thing. This has made quarantine easier. I'm not bitching about the ceramic nail. It's just not
[51:29.520 --> 51:35.120]  my favorite. I'm honest with you guys. If this was a quartz banger on this e-nail, I would be hitting
[51:35.120 --> 51:40.800]  this all of the time. But the ceramic is simply not my favorite, just being honest with you. It
[51:40.800 --> 51:46.240]  doesn't cap as well, and it's just not for me. I like the banger with the bubble cap. So this cord,
[51:47.200 --> 51:51.360]  this is a heated element. There is heat coming off of this right now. You can't see it, but this is
[51:51.360 --> 51:56.240]  hot. This cord is running to a box right here. I'll try to show you the box. It's plugged in,
[51:56.240 --> 52:01.840]  and it's also attached to this. So I've got to be gingerly with this. This box right here, this end
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.960]  plugs into the wall. This end right here is plugged in to here, and you can see it's got the number
[52:06.960 --> 52:15.200]  715 on it. It said it's 710, but it's 712. Sorry, I'm dyslexic. It's 713 now, 714. This is keeping a
[52:15.200 --> 52:20.320]  constant temperature on the top of this dab nail. So right now, if I decided to, which why the fuck
[52:20.320 --> 52:26.240]  not, I could scoot myself a dab of this Garlic Grove Live batter, and this is always hot. There's
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.640]  no maintenance. There's no prep. All I got to do is get a dab, put it on the dabber, and I'll show
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.440]  you how we hit the email, you guys. Just because why wouldn't I do it, right? I'm going to move the
[52:35.440 --> 52:39.760]  mic out of my face. We're going to take a dab. It's already hot. It's ready to go. I'll put a cap on it,
[52:39.760 --> 53:04.230]  take a dab, and we'll talk more. If you're dabbing, now's the time. Cheers. You guys, if you were new
[53:04.230 --> 53:11.350]  at dabbing, do not take a dab that big. That is a professional dabber's dab, and I'm sure you
[53:11.350 --> 53:16.470]  noticed that when I dropped the cap on that nail, the smoke got even thicker. I've got the temperature
[53:16.470 --> 53:20.630]  to that nail set kind of low, and the concentrate just bubbles when you set it on there. It doesn't
[53:20.630 --> 53:24.470]  volatilize, but as soon as you put that cap on there, it's like putting a lid on a pan. It just
[53:24.470 --> 53:29.350]  traps that heat. It just cooks it a little more quickly. It really gives you a solid dab. That
[53:29.350 --> 53:33.350]  tasted delicious, by the way. Shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the Garlic Grove
[53:33.350 --> 53:37.990]  Live batter. It's been some of my favorite shit lately. I'm just going to ramble for a moment and
[53:37.990 --> 53:42.070]  get my shit together. We'll get this show moving again. Trust me, that was a delicious dab.
[53:42.070 --> 53:47.190]  So, I've showed you the ceramic nail. I've showed you the titanium. I've showed you the quartz
[53:47.190 --> 53:51.670]  crystal banger. I've showed you a lot of great shit. Where are we going to go from here? Oh, I
[53:51.670 --> 53:57.990]  know where we go now. We will go to the Terp Pearls, something that came really popular for a little
[53:57.990 --> 54:02.870]  while. It was a device known as the Terp Pearl. I'll show you what a Terp Pearl is. It's real simple.
[54:02.870 --> 54:08.790]  It is... These are little glass balls. It's hard to show you on the camera without dropping them.
[54:08.790 --> 54:13.110]  Just little exactly what they sound like. Round, perfectly round glass balls.
[54:14.150 --> 54:20.550]  Try to pick them up here. There you go. Two round glass balls. And what we do with the Terp Pearls
[54:20.550 --> 54:24.230]  is you get your banger and you gently... They're going to make a tinky noise and I hate the sound
[54:24.230 --> 54:31.270]  of it, but you drop them right in there. And then when you take a dab, the idea is that those Terp
[54:31.270 --> 54:36.870]  Pearls will spin around under the pressure of the carb cap and they move the oil around in your
[54:36.870 --> 54:41.910]  banger to where they touch more of the surface of the banger to where your oil doesn't sit in one
[54:41.910 --> 54:47.270]  spot and cool down one area. It'll move it all over the place and keep the... They also hold
[54:47.270 --> 54:51.270]  heat so they're melting your dab while they're doing it instead of your dab puddling up in one
[54:51.270 --> 54:56.310]  spot. It just makes you get a longer, cleaner, better draw out of a dab. And I'll show you what
[54:56.310 --> 55:00.150]  happens. There's a certain... You have to use a certain kind of carb cap to make it work.
[55:00.150 --> 55:03.430]  Here's the cap that works. When you put it on here and then you draw through it, if you watch
[55:03.430 --> 55:13.840]  on the camera, I don't know if you could see it through the murky part of that nail, but those
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.360]  little balls in there were rapidly spinning around the edges of that banger. So if you suck at the
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.960]  right temperature and you've got oil in there, it'll just keep that... Or not the right temperature,
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.120]  the right pressure. It'll keep those balls moving around. That'll just keep your oil moving over the
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.680]  heat. You don't burn the dab. You don't create a puddle. You get a bigger, fatter dab. For people
[55:31.680 --> 55:37.040]  who take big dabs, that is definitely a good thing to do. I don't do it. I just use the bubble cap.
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.320]  Take a big, fat dab. You've got to clean the turt pearls often. Just more shit to clean. It was a
[55:42.320 --> 55:46.160]  fad for a little bit. Give it a try. If you're into it, you may love it. Some people love it
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.240]  just for the novelty. Some people are into it. I'll show you one more time. See if they spin in there.
[55:56.780 --> 56:01.900]  You can definitely hear them. It's intense when you take a dab with no dab and you're just sucking
[56:01.900 --> 56:05.900]  and sucking. All right, let me put these turt pearls away. Where are we going to go from here?
[56:05.900 --> 56:09.900]  I think that covers most of the dabbing equipment. If you feel like I've forgotten any
[56:10.540 --> 56:13.820]  legends that should have been included in the list, please send me an email. The email address
[56:13.820 --> 56:18.460]  is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Now, let's talk about some of the other things that are
[56:18.460 --> 56:25.660]  required for taking dabs. Oh, I almost forgot to show you. Also, I've got a titanium nail for the
[56:25.660 --> 56:30.140]  e-nail system. This is just a different cord. You just plug this one in. It's got a titanium nail.
[56:30.140 --> 56:34.620]  This one, again, is from highly educated titanium. If I decided to switch up to the tie,
[56:34.620 --> 56:39.660]  I could do that. I do prefer the ceramic over the titanium, but I prefer the quartz
[56:39.740 --> 56:44.540]  over everything. Just my personal opinion, you guys. Nobody really pays me to say any of this
[56:44.540 --> 56:50.700]  stuff. Let's move on to the extra parts that we need for dabbing. Something you can't dab without
[56:51.500 --> 56:56.140]  the torch, bro. Without an e-nail, you definitely need a torch. You're going to have to be able to
[56:56.140 --> 57:00.700]  heat up your banger somehow. Let's start from the beginning. You got a banger. You got a rig. You
[57:00.700 --> 57:05.180]  got a rig with a banger. You need that part. Then you'll need a torch. You'll need a torch to heat
[57:05.180 --> 57:11.980]  up the banger. Then you will need a dabber to put the dab into the banger. Then I highly recommend
[57:11.980 --> 57:15.900]  a carb cap. I like a nice bubble carb cap. If you're going to go with turt pearls, make sure
[57:15.900 --> 57:20.380]  you get the appropriate carb cap that will make the turt pearl spin. When you're shopping for your
[57:20.380 --> 57:24.460]  pearls, the appropriate carb cap probably will be right next to them if you've got a good,
[57:25.020 --> 57:29.260]  reputable, reliable head shop. Or if you're shopping online, they should pop up in the same
[57:29.260 --> 57:35.660]  should be like people that bought that also bought this. So your basics are your rig,
[57:35.660 --> 57:40.140]  your torch, your dabber, your carb cap, and a quality concentrate. After that, you're going to
[57:40.140 --> 57:45.340]  need a few extras. We're going to need to fill the torch because a guy like me goes through a lot of
[57:45.340 --> 57:51.660]  butane. And while we're talking about torches, let me back up. I love you guys. I love all of you.
[57:51.660 --> 57:56.300]  I want you all to take dabs. But please just go get yourself like a cigar torch or a little torch
[57:56.300 --> 58:00.780]  like this that doesn't look like a big crackhead torch. You guys that are dabbing with the fucking
[58:00.780 --> 58:05.100]  big blue torch on your front porch or at the campsite. That shit looks terrible, dude. I
[58:05.100 --> 58:09.580]  don't know. It just looks crackhead ish to me. I love you guys. Just go get a torch, bro. Just
[58:09.580 --> 58:14.620]  take some butane. They're not that expensive. Just just it looks better. It looks so much better
[58:14.620 --> 58:20.380]  than that big fucking canister torch that you're using. Come on, crackhead Magoo. I love you anyway.
[58:20.380 --> 58:24.220]  Either way, you're going to need some butane to fill your torch. Butane is not expensive. You
[58:24.220 --> 58:28.540]  don't need any fancy kind of butane. Don't let them really upsell you. If you've got a normal torch,
[58:28.540 --> 58:32.300]  the cheap butane is going to be fine. If you buy an expensive torch, you may want to get a little
[58:32.300 --> 58:37.180]  price here butane. They claim there are additives and other shit in the cheap butane. I don't know.
[58:37.180 --> 58:41.100]  I'm not an expert there. But it could clog up your torch, it could fuck it up. So if you get an
[58:41.100 --> 58:45.420]  expensive torch, get good butane. This thing was like 30 or 40 bucks. I don't know if that's
[58:45.420 --> 58:51.340]  expensive or not to you. It's got two flames. And it says the name of the brand and it says the name
[58:51.340 --> 58:55.740]  of the brand. They better work together. These came from this one actually came from New Mexico.
[58:55.740 --> 59:00.860]  This one came from a local shop. So you're going to need some butane to keep the dab torch moving.
[59:01.420 --> 59:06.060]  Something else I recommend is a q tip. Why do I recommend some q tips? I've always got a thing a
[59:06.060 --> 59:10.300]  glob mop sitting around. Because most of the time you can see that this banger is a little bit
[59:10.300 --> 59:14.700]  cleaner than the other one. After I take a dab once it's cooled off a little bit, I'll take a q tip or
[59:14.700 --> 59:20.300]  two. Just mop out the crap right out of the banger. Just mop it up. Just clean it right on out so that
[59:20.300 --> 59:25.820]  the next time I dab it, it doesn't taste like shit. These q tips have a pointed end and a rounded
[59:25.820 --> 59:29.900]  excuse me and get that pointed in down in there into the corner, then use the round end to clean
[59:29.900 --> 59:34.540]  it up. I also have another little container over here that acts as a trash can every couple of days.
[59:34.540 --> 59:40.220]  I got to dump that out and get rid of all my my dirty ass q tips. So q tips are very useful. If
[59:40.220 --> 59:46.220]  you're going to use a banger, I also q tip out the quartz or the what's it called again, the ceramic
[59:46.220 --> 59:50.380]  banger. If I remember, I didn't do it this time wasn't paying attention was just keep keeping the
[59:50.380 --> 59:55.980]  show moving. So another thing I recommend that will come in very handy in your dab life, which
[59:55.980 --> 01:00:02.220]  right now during the COVID situation is kind of a commodity, but some sort of isopropyl alcohol,
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:09.260]  some 91% or better rubbing alcohol. When you're dabbing, life will get sticky. I just set this
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.500]  dabber down right here on the table. And the back of it is sticky from my dabs and I got a sticky
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.380]  spot. My carb cap rolled across the table. Now I got a sticky spot. Now I'm going to move it over
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.580]  here out of my way and now I've got two sticky spots. Everything is sticky and it's only been
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.500]  a few minutes since I've cleaned the table I cleaned up before I did this podcast. Everything
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.820]  is sticky over here now. A little bit of isopropyl alcohol will fix that right up. It'll be your
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:36.540]  friend. I also like to have alcohol wipes. I don't have them out right now because I'm here by myself
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.660]  but the little square packets of alcohol wipes. I like those if you happen to be dabbing with friends
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.460]  before and or after a COVID situation. I was still cleaning the rig with those. Just clean the
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.700]  mouthpiece. I got a mustache. Girls wear a lipstick. Just clean the fucking mouthpiece
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.300]  occasionally. Every couple of dabbers. If you don't know the guy before you, don't feel bad about
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.900]  cleaning the fucking mouthpiece. Even if you do know him, don't feel bad about cleaning the
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.540]  mouthpiece. You're seeing, we're seeing why COVID is why we should clean mouthpieces. You can't
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:06.780]  trust anybody's spit or anything now. We got to take care of ourselves. But the little alcohol
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:11.340]  wipes are always handy. I like to have those especially at events where we're smoking in a
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:20.060]  community fashion. What else do we need to talk about? An oil slick pad. Most of this entire
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.980]  table is covered in a slick pad. I'm going to try to tip the camera down and show you what I'm
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:30.380]  talking about. This green and white pad here is a slick pad. Nothing sticks to it. It doesn't. It's
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:34.780]  got a couple of burn marks on it from cleaning nails and shit but it keeps the table safe so
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:39.100]  that my table doesn't get real super sticky. This part, the stickiness wipes right off real easy
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.740]  with a little bit of rubbing alcohol. I recommend a couple of slick mats or slick pads. Somewhere to
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.820]  store your concentrates. Keep your computer desk or your dabbing space sticky free. Don't get your
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:52.140]  mom's table all sticky, whatever you're doing. They're just a really good investment. Keeps
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:57.020]  shit nice and clean for you. Also, some paper towels. Put them right next to your rubbing
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.300]  alcohol because you're going to need to clean the table quite often. You'll see me sometimes doing a
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.940]  podcast and I reach my arm up and rub my forearm. It's because I just stuck it in a fucking dab.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:13.020]  So clean the table a lot. All right. I think that covers most of the concentrates. I covered most of
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:18.300]  the gear. I'm looking at all the shit on the table. I think I covered that. A couple of different rig
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.860]  styles I should talk about. This is your normal perk type rig. It's got the downstem and the
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:29.100]  hammerhead. We talked about that. I hit out of this one here. This one's got like a honeycomb
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:34.140]  rig. If you notice the smoke goes down and then through this, then there is a disc in here with
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.380]  holes on the top that make the smoke go straight up. So that's a really cool filtration system.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.780]  This bubble here prevents the water from going too high and splashing me in the face. I'll give
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:50.000]  a little pull of that. You can see the honeycomb style perk. I don't know if you can see how that
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.240]  water just goes straight up. Gives it a whole lot of filtration, a whole bunch of micro bubbles in
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.880]  there. We've got, of course, the Grow From Your Heart podcast rig. Just got a little downstem
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.200]  with two holes. Call that a two-hole Diffie. Could be more than two holes now that I'm looking at it.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.160]  But it's got some holes in there. Nice and simple. I like a nice, I like this one because it's nice
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.200]  and small. Fits, maybe it fits in the cup holder allegedly perfectly. I don't know what I'm talking
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.680]  about. I like a little mini rig. These used to be all the rage. This one went to a couple of
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.920]  cannabis cups because it's easy to carry around and it doesn't topple over. Then this one is a
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.960]  little bit unique. This one, it's known, there's a company that makes rigs like this. They call
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:34.640]  them a Klein. This company calls it an Encycler. If you look at it, the smoke would go down this way,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.640]  then it would go in through here, then it goes up like the other rig through the honeycomb. But then
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.360]  as it goes up, the water falls into these holes. I don't know if, yeah, you can see there's a hole
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.840]  here, there's a hole here, and another hole on the inside of this rig. There's a cone. So the water
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.120]  would fall into the holes of the cone, then it swirls like a tornado, goes down, then out of this
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.520]  drain on the back of the rig, then back toward the bottom. So the water is going up and then
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.480]  recycling through the conular shape, then through the funnel, then through the drain, then back up.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.560]  So the water is moving as well. It's known as an Encycler. It's a recycler, but inside of ourselves,
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.520]  inside of itself. I'll give a little pull so you can see what it does. Watch for the water to fill
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.320]  the holes at the top and then fill the cylinder on the inside and swirl back down. That's the neat
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.280]  part. Just a lot of cool filtration is why I like this one big, nice, smooth dabs. But here we go.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:40.790]  I'll give it a pull so you can see. You can see where the water drains back down in. You guys,
[01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:45.030]  I do encourage you if you're listening to this on an audio format, this is one that you're going to
[01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:49.910]  want to catch on video. I encourage you go to YouTube, search for the Grow From Your Heart
[01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:54.630]  podcast. Even if you can't watch the videos all the time, please subscribe. Check this one out.
[01:04:54.630 --> 01:05:01.110]  Leave some comments. This is a 7-10-2020 video. I hope you're digging it. All right, where are we
[01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:05.270]  going to go from there? You guys, I showed you a bunch of cool rigs. Let's talk. I talked a little
[01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:11.830]  bit about dab size. Do small dabs. Like I keep saying, you can't undo that dab. If you get too
[01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:15.670]  high, you're not going to enjoy it. You're not going to want to dab anymore. You may get paranoid.
[01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:19.990]  You'll get uncomfortable. I'm not trying to discourage you. Take a small dab and enjoy
[01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:25.110]  yourself. Take seven little dabs and enjoy yourself. Then later on in the week, take a bigger
[01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:30.710]  dab. Then work your way up. You guys see me doing monster dabs. Don't try to be like me. I'm not
[01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:35.110]  saying I'm cool. I'm not saying I'm Robocop. I'm saying if you're new, the dabs I do are going to
[01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:39.190]  fuck your whole day up and you're not going to enjoy it. I've been doing this for a long time.
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:43.430]  I'm a fucking pothead. I've been training. I'm a black belt. I say that a lot. Not only am I a
[01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:49.270]  black belt in growing, I'm a fucking dabbing black belt. So be careful. That's not from my ego,
[01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:53.270]  you guys. That is from my heart caring about you. I'm not trying to say I'm a monster dabber. It
[01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:58.230]  sounds like I'm bragging or something. I'm not. I'm saying I do heroic doses and I don't want to
[01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:04.710]  watch you try to be a hero and hurt yourself. So do small dabs. Now let's talk about dab temperature.
[01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:12.230]  I do kind of big dabs. So my dabs are hotter than the average bear. When I heat up the nail,
[01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:18.230]  I usually heat it up until it's almost to the point of glow. You don't need it to glow. I know
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:23.750]  right to where it's about to glow. Then I'll put my hand by it. I hold my hand about, it's probably
[01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.550]  a half an inch, maybe I'm going to say a good half an inch away from the nail. I want to feel the
[01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:33.270]  heat of the nail. I don't want to touch it. I know if I touch it at that temperature, it's going to
[01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:38.150]  fucking suck, but I can get real close. It's not going to cook my hand if I touch it, but I want
[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:42.710]  it to feel, you can feel the moisture being cooked out of your skin when you get close to it. I know
[01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:46.950]  that sounds bad, but it's just a pinch. It's not a burn. It's not a hurt, but you can feel your skin
[01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:51.910]  contract and go, ooh, that's hot. Get me away from there. It's your skin. It's the moisture in your
[01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:57.750]  skin just going, I don't think you should do that, bro. So kind of experiment with your dab heat.
[01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:03.910]  My advice is to go too cool before you go too hot. If you think it's not going to melt, then go a
[01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:07.510]  little bit hotter. Put the cap on there and draw through it. If you think you could have gotten
[01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:11.270]  a bigger dab, if there's a puddle left, you probably could have gotten hotter, but I want
[01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:15.830]  you to start nice and cool. Don't go roasting your fucking lungs. Something I should talk about
[01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:21.830]  e-nails. They've got a number on the box. That's an arbitrary number. I do not believe that they
[01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:25.910]  have, some of them may, they're affordable and I don't think that they're using this technology
[01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:31.590]  because we can afford it. I don't think there is a sensor running up the cord saying, oh, the surface
[01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:37.510]  of your nail is this temperature. I will adjust. I think we are sending out an arbitrary number
[01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:43.430]  worth of heat, a worth of electricity, kilohertz or something down this cable to heat up this
[01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:48.070]  element. And then that heat has to travel to the head of the nail. So that is kind of an arbitrary
[01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:54.310]  number. Find the perfect setting on your e-nail. Don't rely on my e-mail number. Don't rely on
[01:07:54.310 --> 01:08:00.790]  anybody else's e-mail number. The manufacturer or who sent it to you may have a recommendation.
[01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:06.390]  Start there or a little bit lower and work your way up. It's better to start with a dab that won't
[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:11.190]  melt. You may have to waste a couple of dabs, but that is all about the learning process. Just blow
[01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:15.750]  a couple of dabs off, let them evaporate, let them fucking melt, let them waste. But once you get to
[01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:19.830]  that perfect temperature, it'll be magical. Every time you reach for the e-mail, you'll be able to
[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:24.310]  get that fucking perfect, perfect dab and then clean it every time. Give it maintenance. Make
[01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:29.270]  sure to turn it off when you leave. You have no idea how many times I've walked in the house
[01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:34.870]  and fucking saw those numbers lit up on the box and went, oh, fuck. I don't think anything will
[01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:39.270]  go wrong, but that's a hot thing. Just sitting here on the table while I'm away. I don't have a
[01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:43.910]  cat, but if I had a cat, a cat, I know a cat would come knock that over just to be a fucking cat.
[01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:49.910]  And then you'd have a fucking dab nail fire all by the kitty. So dab temperature, go low. Don't
[01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:54.310]  go too hot. We don't want you to roast your lungs, roast your esophagus. Don't burn your shit out.
[01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:59.750]  You can go hotter. Don't take too big of a dab. You can go bigger. Where else are we? Don't hold
[01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:04.710]  your dabs in. I see a lot of people try to take a big dab and then hold it in. It's not necessary
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:09.510]  with a dab, with a bong rip, with a pipe rip. There's no need to try to hold in your hit.
[01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:16.390]  That will give you OCD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder that causes problems in your
[01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:21.670]  lungs. That pressure is not good for your lungs. Your lungs work like a filter. When you breathed
[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:25.750]  in that smoke, it got all of the cannabinoids, all the terpenes, it got all the shit that it
[01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:31.030]  was going to get. On the way back out, it probably took a little bit more. I'm not a super scientist,
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:35.270]  but then you blow it out. All the shit you don't want went into that cloud. All the shit that you
[01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:40.150]  want stayed into your lungs. Don't hold it. It's not good for you. You'll give yourself lung
[01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:44.550]  problems, heart problems, chest problems. You'll get a head rush out of it, but it's not worth it
[01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:50.470]  in the long run. Do not hold your dabs in. I don't find it necessary. It's not good for you.
[01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:58.550]  I think that is most of what I had written down. We could cover some etiquette. When you're done
[01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:03.670]  dabbing, take the carb cap off of the nail because you don't want to pass it like this to me and have
[01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:09.590]  it fall off on my table and break. Or if we are somewhere carpeted, like a lot of cars allegedly
[01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:14.790]  have carpet, I don't want you to drop that carb cap onto my leather seats or onto my floor that's
[01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.950]  carpeted and then get it all furry and we got to fucking clean it. So when you're passing it,
[01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:25.510]  take the carb cap off, pass them as two separate things. Be careful that way, especially with an
[01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:29.350]  email. Do not leave this cap on top of the email. Let's look at what's going to happen here. You're
[01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.030]  going to take your dab like a fucking stone bro and you set these two down together and you just
[01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:37.270]  leave it there. What are we doing? We're heating up this carb cap. The heat's going to climb up to
[01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:41.510]  here. Mike is going to come over and be like, I need a dab. He'll grab this and burn the fuck out
[01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:45.670]  of himself because it's been sitting here all day heating up. Let's not do that to our friends. Take
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:51.910]  the carb cap off of the rig. Also, if you dab out of somebody else's rig and you're not familiar with
[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:57.030]  how to Q tip that fucker out, ask them politely. Hey, bro, will you show me how to Q tip this thing
[01:10:57.030 --> 01:11:00.870]  because I don't want to leave your banger all dirty and chazzed. Feel free to ask for help with
[01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:05.910]  somebody else's equipment. A lot of the rigs, a lot of the bangers we're using are not cheap. You guys,
[01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:11.590]  I buy production glass because I'd rather get the hit than the art. I want the punch to the face
[01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:17.110]  more than a colorful rig. But a lot of our friends make beautiful, colorful custom art. Don't don't
[01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.870]  break it. Don't be disrespectful with your friends glass. That's another thing I should mention when
[01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:26.390]  you've got your buddies expensive glass. Don't be boisterous and expressive and too much like like
[01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:30.150]  this rig here. I wouldn't I wouldn't want you doing that with my rig right there. I know it's there.
[01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:35.590]  It's mine. But if that's your buddies, maybe move it over here before you start fucking talking with
[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:41.190]  your hands and shit. So keep shit like that in mind. Some of our rigs are quite pricey. I wouldn't
[01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:47.670]  be uncommon to be at a sesh in Denver, in Colorado, in LA, wherever you are, and come across a 10, 15,
[01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:53.110]  $20,000 dab rig that people just pass around. So keep that kind of shit in mind. Don't break
[01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:59.430]  people shit. Have respect for it. Um, I think that is all I've got for you guys. showed you
[01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:04.790]  all the gear gave you some tips. We talked about all the concentrates. I think now it is time to
[01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:08.550]  take some fucking dabs. Let's wrap up the show. And then I'm going to take a couple of dabs out
[01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:12.150]  of the banger. I'll take a dab out of the banger. And that'll probably be the end of it. Ooh, I
[01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:16.950]  should hit the CRC. Also, I got some homework to do. So I'm going to do this part. I'll keep the
[01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:21.190]  video recording while I take some dabs. Maybe I'll play some of the music or something at the end of
[01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:25.110]  there. I'm not sure how this will work, but we'll make it happen. Fuck it. We'll do it live. Um,

[01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.190]  you guys. I'm gonna hang out and take a couple of dabs. I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh
[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:16.630]  new content. I want to give a giant shout out to my friend TaskRock and until next time, take a fat
[01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:23.110]  dab and give your mom a hug for me. I'm gonna hit the CRC first because I've never tried this and
[01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:29.030]  it's new to me and then I'll probably hit some batter. All right, here we go. All right, my first
[01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:37.270]  review of CRC here on the show. It doesn't have any desirable flavor. It was kind of, it was like
[01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:41.990]  dabbing hospital product. It felt very sterile. It didn't have much flavor. The high got me
[01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:47.190]  immediately but it already feels like it's wearing off. It punched me and then it was like exhale,
[01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:51.670]  high, high. I'm not high anymore. I don't know if you could tell. It didn't really do much. It took
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:57.510]  a good dab. So that is my review of the CRC. I'm gonna take a dab now of the Garlic Grove
[01:14:57.510 --> 01:15:02.070]  Live Batter off of the email just because it's convenient and then we will say goodbye for the
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:06.710]  evening and I will go find some food. Thank you for watching you guys. Let's take a dab together.
[01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:11.350]  If you are dabbing, now's the time. Please leave a comment and let me know what you're dabbing for
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:17.910]  710. Go to the YouTube comments and type in I am dabbing this for 710. I am dabbing Garlic Grove
[01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:21.270]  Live Batter. Dab with me guys and gals.
