[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:01.920 --> 00:06.200]  It is time for episode 478 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.200 --> 00:08.600]  Sitting across the table from me is White Mike.
[00:08.600 --> 00:09.600]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:09.600 --> 00:10.600]  Thanks, man.
[00:10.600 --> 00:11.600]  What's up, everybody?
[00:11.600 --> 00:12.720]  You guys have been begging for him to come back.
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.080]  I finally got him here.
[00:14.080 --> 00:15.080]  And I'm back.
[00:15.080 --> 00:16.080]  He is back.
[00:16.080 --> 00:17.480]  We're going to kick out a podcast for you.
[00:17.480 --> 00:19.260]  This is episode 478.
[00:19.260 --> 00:23.840]  As always, the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:23.840 --> 00:29.040]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:29.040 --> 00:30.720]  Seeds Here Now.
[00:30.720 --> 00:37.760]  Of course, you find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.840]  You know, we like to start the show off by talking about what we're smoking.
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.520]  We just took dabs of Miracle Alien Cookies live batter from our friends at Green Dot
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.980]  Labs.
[00:46.980 --> 00:51.040]  This is a cross of Alien Cookies, Columbian, and Starfighter.
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.240]  The flavor on the package is described as jelly biscuits and lavender.
[00:55.240 --> 00:56.240]  We've had this conversation.
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.240]  That's fair.
[00:57.240 --> 00:58.240]  You say fair?
[00:58.440 --> 00:59.920]  I don't taste jelly biscuits and lavender in there.
[00:59.920 --> 01:04.440]  I taste a lot of unique things, but I still am not convinced that it's jelly biscuits
[01:04.440 --> 01:05.680]  and lavender.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.000]  Most of the time, the folks at Green Dot are spot on with their descriptions.
[01:09.000 --> 01:10.920]  This time, we may have to have a talk.
[01:10.920 --> 01:12.360]  I still love you guys over there.
[01:12.360 --> 01:19.580]  On the back of the package, it does say that this product contains 61.89% THC and non-detectable
[01:19.580 --> 01:21.240]  amounts of CBD.
[01:21.240 --> 01:24.360]  Got to love it.
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.360]  I really enjoy the macro.
[01:25.360 --> 01:27.000]  It's one of my favorites.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.120]  The flavor, the buzz, I've been enjoying it quite a bit.
[01:30.120 --> 01:31.700]  I'm a fan as well.
[01:31.700 --> 01:35.720]  You were red-eyed and droopy-faced, so I think it's working.
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.840]  Before we get too far, let's do some shout-outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.920]  Big thanks to everybody who supports us on Patreon.
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.320]  Let's start off with a giant shout-out to my buddy, Glenn G.
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.320]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout-out to Jacob W.
[01:47.320 --> 01:51.080]  I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout-out and a thank you to James
[01:51.080 --> 01:52.080]  Brown.
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.520]  Of course, a big giant thank you shout-out to OG Purple Thumb.
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.280]  I always want to send a big thank you to Zoso J. A big thank you shout-out to JM.
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.040]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high-five to Tommy.
[02:04.040 --> 02:05.040]  We got a new friend here.
[02:05.040 --> 02:07.980]  We've got Daft Max 1980 hanging out.
[02:07.980 --> 02:09.880]  Big shout-out to Daft Max 1980.
[02:09.880 --> 02:10.880]  Thank you for the support.
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.360]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:16.360 --> 02:20.560]  high-five thank you shout-out to our friend Fat Rabbit.
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.400]  Big thanks to all of our friends who support the show on Patreon.
[02:23.400 --> 02:29.880]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.920]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.760]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.240]  All right, Mike, you ready to get into this part of the podcast?
[02:39.240 --> 02:40.240]  Let's do it.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.240]  Let's do it.
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.400]  I feel like we should hear the little drum roll and tone load should come in.
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.400]  Let's do it.
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.080]  I think we're thinking different songs, but we're going to be okay.
[02:48.080 --> 02:50.280]  That's going to be the wild thing.
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.280]  All right.
[02:51.280 --> 02:53.120]  I've got a news article in front of me.
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.240]  I'm trying to make the iPad quit dancing.
[02:55.240 --> 02:57.880]  It's doing the screen orientation thing.
[02:57.880 --> 03:00.000]  There's a very interesting news article that came out.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.680]  It caught my eye immediately.
[03:01.680 --> 03:04.080]  It caught social media's eye very quickly.
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.840]  I saw a lot of very interesting comments.
[03:05.840 --> 03:07.880]  We'll get to that part in a minute.
[03:07.880 --> 03:12.680]  Before we get into the article, the source of the article, the Denver Westward has been
[03:12.680 --> 03:19.160]  doing top-notch cannabis reporting for like 20 years now.
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.160]  Definitely check them out.
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.160]  Show them some love.
[03:21.160 --> 03:23.040]  Sorry, I was taking a note while you were saying that.
[03:23.960 --> 03:24.960]  I was trying to take that opportunity to write a note.
[03:24.960 --> 03:27.720]  I hope I spelled that to where I can remember what that says.
[03:27.720 --> 03:31.080]  This article came out October 30th.
[03:31.080 --> 03:34.480]  We're a few days behind here, but we're going to blame that on taking Mike a couple of days
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.920]  to get here.
[03:35.920 --> 03:37.240]  This article came out in the Westward.
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.240]  Mike gave them a shout out.
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.240]  Do we have an author?
[03:39.240 --> 03:40.600]  Let's give an author a shout out.
[03:40.600 --> 03:42.680]  This was written by Thomas Mitchell.
[03:42.680 --> 03:50.200]  The headline says, in random mold tests at 25 Denver dispensaries, 80% fail.
[03:50.200 --> 03:51.200]  That's a scary headline.
[03:51.360 --> 03:54.160]  You can tell by social media that many people read that headline.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.120]  That's a headline that's going to spread.
[03:56.120 --> 04:00.160]  Many people didn't get past that headline from what I saw on social media by their comments,
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.880]  by a lot of things that they said.
[04:01.880 --> 04:03.440]  We'll talk about that stuff here.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.000]  Hopefully we'll segue into that smoothly.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.280]  The article goes like this.
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.360]  It says, Denver recently conducted random tests of more than two dozen local dispensaries
[04:12.360 --> 04:18.080]  to learn more about potential yeast and mold issues with marijuana, and the results were
[04:18.080 --> 04:19.840]  not good.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.080]  It says Denver recently conducted tests.
[04:22.080 --> 04:23.440]  I'd like to know who did the tests.
[04:23.440 --> 04:27.000]  I don't think it was just Denver because Denver's not a person.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Who is the organization?
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.680]  Maybe we'll get to that.
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.760]  On August 19th, the city of Denver sent a notice to every licensed marijuana dispensary
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.920]  in the city, warning that investigators would be conducting random assessments at about
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.600]  25 stores in the coming weeks to evaluate contaminants and products on store shelves.
[04:47.600 --> 04:53.080]  Each sample will be tested for pesticides and total yeast and mold by the state and
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.920]  ISO certified testing facility.
[04:57.920 --> 05:01.680]  Results of their respective testing will be shared with each facility and will also be
[05:01.680 --> 05:06.800]  shared broadly within a write-up of results the announcement read.
[05:06.800 --> 05:09.320]  They went to 25 stores.
[05:09.320 --> 05:10.320]  They sent a letter saying-
[05:10.320 --> 05:16.080]  I think we're still waiting on the broad write-up of what they found, so we don't have a lot
[05:16.200 --> 05:19.800]  more detail than what's been presented as of now.
[05:19.800 --> 05:23.000]  So they were looking for pesticides, yeast, and mold.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.720]  That's a good thing to know from the very beginning here.
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.360]  I think a lot of the people that saw this on social media didn't realize yeast and mold
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.880]  were the potential mold issues that they're looking for.
[05:32.880 --> 05:38.200]  I think that people thought this was moldy weed, like weed that had powdery mildew on
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.400]  it or weed that had bud rot in it, which may not be the case.
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.800]  That could be possible in some cases, but I'm sure that in the majority of it, these
[05:46.520 --> 05:49.760]  things just passed or failed the microbial test for yeast.
[05:49.760 --> 05:50.760]  There's more to the article.
[05:50.760 --> 05:53.840]  The other piece of information that caught my eye that you've covered now is that all
[05:53.840 --> 05:58.360]  the stores in the city and county of Denver got a letter saying, in the coming weeks,
[05:58.360 --> 05:59.960]  this is going to happen.
[05:59.960 --> 06:08.040]  And so that tells me that the odds that any of this was visibly identifiable is zero or
[06:08.040 --> 06:09.040]  close to zero.
[06:09.040 --> 06:11.240]  And that was something that somebody on social media said.
[06:11.240 --> 06:14.040]  They said, why are these people putting moldy weed on the shelves?
[06:14.040 --> 06:15.040]  Can't they tell it's moldy?
[06:15.280 --> 06:16.280]  Aren't they trained?
[06:16.280 --> 06:18.840]  And I said, can you see a mold spore?
[06:18.840 --> 06:20.120]  Can you look at a mold spore?
[06:20.120 --> 06:21.120]  They're all over the place.
[06:21.120 --> 06:22.760]  Can you see a yeast spore?
[06:22.760 --> 06:24.760]  Can you identify that without a magnifying glass?
[06:24.760 --> 06:27.800]  The level for yeast is twice what's in the air.
[06:27.800 --> 06:28.800]  And that's nothing.
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.600]  Like if you clap twice, you're going to fail the test with your hands.
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.080]  And that's something that I want to talk about.
[06:34.080 --> 06:35.600]  We'll get to that here in just a second.
[06:35.600 --> 06:37.000]  Let me find where I was in this article.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.560]  It goes on to say, although that write-up is still months away from being released,
[06:41.560 --> 06:46.080]  Westward learned of the test and analyzed 25 Denver Department of Public Health and
[06:46.080 --> 06:51.000]  Environment dispensary inspection reports filed over a two-day span in October.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.640]  Of the reports filed between September 9th and 11th, 20 listed at least one or more hold
[06:56.640 --> 06:58.760]  and quarantine orders of cannabis.
[06:58.760 --> 07:00.960]  I should read that more smoothly.
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.080]  20 listed holds or quarantine orders for cannabis.
[07:06.080 --> 07:11.640]  And it says for cannabis flour, shake, or pre-rolled joints, an 80% failure rate.
[07:11.640 --> 07:16.240]  Each of those disciplinary actions was tied to plant matter testing above the maximum
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.200]  allowed total for yeast and mold.
[07:20.200 --> 07:25.160]  Let's talk briefly about the testing and yeast and mold.
[07:25.160 --> 07:31.840]  Testing is really simply done, but also it's really easy to...
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.520]  We test such large batches that even if what we send does pass, there's so much left that
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.800]  we can't test all of it, right?
[07:40.800 --> 07:47.520]  The sample that gets sent to the lab is good, but depending on how and when that sample
[07:47.520 --> 07:53.640]  is taken, how it's treated versus how the rest of the crop is treated, there's a million
[07:53.640 --> 07:56.920]  different things that could have led to this.
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.920]  But there's...
[07:57.920 --> 08:00.000]  Are you done reading the article as we get to the end?
[08:00.160 --> 08:01.840]  I think there's one more short paragraph.
[08:01.840 --> 08:05.960]  It says the failed plant matter wasn't typically covered in white and gray mold, like an old
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.840]  piece of bread, but still can carry potentially toxic fungi that isn't detectable by the naked
[08:10.840 --> 08:11.840]  eye.
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.840]  That supports what I said a minute ago.
[08:12.840 --> 08:16.920]  It says the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment officials would not confirm
[08:16.920 --> 08:21.360]  whether all 25 of the tests conducted within that two-day period were part of the planned
[08:21.360 --> 08:26.920]  assessment of potential mold and yeast issues, though they acknowledge that some were.
[08:26.920 --> 08:29.160]  There is a whole lot more to this that I didn't realize was here.
[08:29.320 --> 08:33.400]  I would imagine we probably did some routine inspections during that time.
[08:33.400 --> 08:36.280]  Food and marijuana safety manager Abby Davidson says...
[08:36.280 --> 08:41.940]  I'm just going to scan this and see if we need to cover this.
[08:41.940 --> 08:46.340]  We typically don't do 25 investigations in a week.
[08:46.340 --> 08:50.740]  They stress that the random assessment inspections were part of a long-planned research project
[08:50.740 --> 08:55.300]  to learn more about the shelf life and packaging of marijuana that had been announced in August,
[08:55.300 --> 08:58.880]  and they were not targeting any specific dispensaries.
[08:58.880 --> 09:00.380]  So that's a good thing to hear.
[09:00.380 --> 09:02.900]  They're trying to actually learn so they can make this safer for us.
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.740]  There's a lot of information.
[09:04.740 --> 09:06.620]  This is going to be fun and rambly.
[09:06.620 --> 09:07.700]  I love it.
[09:07.700 --> 09:11.940]  The majority of the dispensaries that failed microbial testing had gotten the flagged marijuana
[09:11.940 --> 09:15.660]  products from wholesale providers, which were not named in the reports.
[09:15.660 --> 09:20.240]  Every commercial grow must send samples of each harvest to state-licensed labs for microbial
[09:20.240 --> 09:22.540]  testing before that product arrives at the stores.
[09:22.540 --> 09:26.180]  That's accurate according to MED regulations.
[09:26.180 --> 09:31.220]  And it says, while there are defined acceptable levels of microbes prior to leaving the grow
[09:31.220 --> 09:36.740]  facility, we are unaware of the existence of acceptable post-delivery microbial levels
[09:36.740 --> 09:40.780]  once the flower product leaves the grow and winds up on our shelves, says one dispensary
[09:40.780 --> 09:44.100]  owner who had two strains fail the assessment.
[09:44.100 --> 09:50.620]  That's because there is no universal test for products once they hit our shelves.
[09:50.620 --> 09:55.580]  There's a lot more to this, but I think we have covered the part that we need to cover.
[09:55.980 --> 10:01.020]  The first thing that really stood out to me is this is a news report in the Westward.
[10:01.020 --> 10:06.380]  The test was conducted by the Denver Department of Health and Environment.
[10:06.380 --> 10:13.380]  They haven't released the results yet or anything detailing the study that they've done.
[10:13.380 --> 10:17.260]  The Westward just got word that they were doing this.
[10:17.260 --> 10:23.020]  The notice letter that went out to all the dispensaries in Denver County had a few parameters
[10:23.020 --> 10:27.180]  in it that they're using to come up with the 80% number.
[10:27.180 --> 10:34.620]  They saw that 20 hold orders were submitted all over a two-day period in October.
[10:34.620 --> 10:40.220]  And they're assuming that those 20 were all part of this investigation.
[10:40.220 --> 10:42.460]  And that leaves five that didn't pass.
[10:42.460 --> 10:49.700]  That's where they're, or that five that did pass, which is where they get their 80% number.
[10:49.700 --> 11:00.500]  The dispensary owner that talks about having two wholesale samples fail had two samples fail.
[11:00.500 --> 11:06.580]  I don't know of how many they tested from him, but that tells me that the 80% number
[11:06.580 --> 11:12.420]  is nonsense because there weren't 25 samples if this guy had two fail.
[11:12.420 --> 11:14.780]  Or they didn't test 25 dispensaries.
[11:14.780 --> 11:16.700]  You know what I mean?
[11:16.700 --> 11:23.460]  There's part of the math that's missing that we'll learn about in the report to give us a real number.
[11:23.460 --> 11:29.060]  The other part of this, they don't talk about a lot of things going on in the marketplace
[11:29.060 --> 11:31.980]  right before these tests were done in October.
[11:31.980 --> 11:34.220]  That's something I wrote down too.
[11:34.220 --> 11:35.860]  Should we go into all that stuff now?
[11:35.860 --> 11:36.860]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.860]  Go deep.
[11:37.860 --> 11:39.780]  In Colorado for the last, God, how long?
[11:39.780 --> 11:40.780]  What, six months?
[11:40.780 --> 11:41.780]  Five months?
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.780]  Yeah, at least.
[11:42.860 --> 11:50.140]  There's been a major legal marijuana market product shortage.
[11:50.140 --> 11:55.020]  This spring in Colorado, it was unseasonably damp.
[11:55.020 --> 11:58.860]  We got a truckload of rain that we don't usually get.
[11:58.860 --> 12:05.380]  And environmental controls have been a major hurdle for the legal marijuana industry.
[12:05.380 --> 12:08.740]  Growing indoors on a commercial level presents some significant-
[12:08.740 --> 12:09.740]  Challenges.
[12:09.740 --> 12:10.740]  Challenges.
[12:10.740 --> 12:12.740]  When it's humid outside, you're fighting with that.
[12:12.740 --> 12:15.500]  Your equipment has to get dialed in and sometimes it's hard.
[12:15.500 --> 12:16.500]  Yep.
[12:16.500 --> 12:19.340]  And everybody had it dialed in for last year's weather patterns.
[12:19.340 --> 12:22.380]  Some owners don't want to buy more dehumidifiers this year.
[12:22.380 --> 12:27.780]  Or didn't realize how big of a hole they were in until it was too late.
[12:27.780 --> 12:34.900]  And so while there hasn't been a lot of press coverage on the shortage, it's been obvious
[12:34.900 --> 12:37.300]  to everyone in the industry.
[12:37.860 --> 12:41.860]  And it should have been obvious to consumers and patients.
[12:41.860 --> 12:47.620]  Watching store shelves go from having 30 jars of herb to select from, to having 10, to having
[12:47.620 --> 12:48.620]  four.
[12:48.620 --> 12:53.780]  We've watched it happen for half a year or more now.
[12:53.780 --> 13:00.100]  My guess is the product shortage was likely caused by people failing testing because of
[13:00.100 --> 13:05.060]  all the additional moisture in Colorado for the first part of the summer.
[13:05.500 --> 13:09.620]  We saw a few reports of product being destroyed because it had too much.
[13:09.620 --> 13:10.620]  It didn't pass tests.
[13:10.620 --> 13:16.060]  There's been a couple of big recalls and a couple of other companies that have put out
[13:16.060 --> 13:21.740]  notices saying that they had to destroy stuff over the last six, eight months.
[13:21.740 --> 13:30.740]  And all of that product is going to have the same problems until the problem gets fixed.
[13:31.060 --> 13:35.060]  So the weather didn't adjust itself back to normal until the end of summer.
[13:35.060 --> 13:36.060]  Still hasn't.
[13:36.060 --> 13:41.060]  So only the companies that really invested heavily had a chance to fix the problems that
[13:41.060 --> 13:42.060]  they were seeing.
[13:42.060 --> 13:50.060]  And a lot of product ended up having to be remitted for retesting or put on hold or turn
[13:50.060 --> 13:53.060]  into oil and cleaned up into a usable product.
[13:53.060 --> 13:58.060]  And just for a side note, they retest that oil.
[13:58.380 --> 14:01.380]  They retest that also to make sure that that passes lab tests.
[14:01.380 --> 14:02.380]  So don't think that they just run it.
[14:02.380 --> 14:07.380]  So once they make it into oil, it gets retested so that you know none of the contaminants
[14:07.380 --> 14:10.380]  move on into the new process or in the new product.
[14:10.380 --> 14:11.380]  Yeah.
[14:11.380 --> 14:13.380]  They're just not polishing turds and sending you out shiny turds still.
[14:13.380 --> 14:15.380]  Well, they kind of are, but I mean, it's safe turds.
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.380]  Yeah.
[14:16.380 --> 14:20.380]  But in Colorado, I think of it as like the hot dog of the cannabis world.
[14:20.380 --> 14:22.380]  It's distillate is for sure the hot dog of water.
[14:22.380 --> 14:23.380]  Technically it's food.
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.380]  So I completely cut you off.
[14:24.380 --> 14:25.380]  I apologize.
[14:25.700 --> 14:29.700]  One of the things in Colorado that a lot of people outside the industry aren't necessarily
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.700]  aware of is a thing called process validation.
[14:31.700 --> 14:37.700]  When a production facility harvests a strain, they have to send samples to a lab to get
[14:37.700 --> 14:41.700]  tested for the stuff that all these samples failed for.
[14:41.700 --> 14:44.700]  And there's a half dozen different tests that you have to have done now.
[14:44.700 --> 14:51.700]  But the important part is, is that you're not just going to have to do a lab test.
[14:52.020 --> 14:58.020]  But the important part is, is process validation.
[14:58.020 --> 15:03.020]  Once you've harvested a strain a couple of times over a certain time period.
[15:03.020 --> 15:07.020]  So I don't remember what the numbers are off the top of my head, but I think it's like
[15:07.020 --> 15:10.020]  six times in six months or four times in six months.
[15:10.020 --> 15:12.020]  Four times in six is what I think I remember.
[15:12.020 --> 15:15.020]  It's been a minute since I've had to schedule this out.
[15:15.020 --> 15:21.020]  But once a strain, say your blue dream passes all its tests and becomes process validated,
[15:21.340 --> 15:26.340]  you don't have to send every single batch to the testing lab.
[15:26.340 --> 15:28.340]  Why'd you pick blue dream? That infuriated me.
[15:28.340 --> 15:33.340]  And I didn't want to use a strain I like to tell people it's moldy because of process validation.
[15:33.340 --> 15:35.340]  Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the testing.
[15:35.340 --> 15:37.340]  We kind of skipped right to the validation.
[15:37.340 --> 15:41.340]  So let's say there are many different harvest methods.
[15:41.340 --> 15:49.340]  Basically, you send a thing to the MED saying, this is how my product is stored at this time.
[15:49.660 --> 15:52.660]  And they send you a thing and says, cool, in container 32,
[15:52.660 --> 15:55.660]  reach to the bottom left corner and pull out a sample from there.
[15:55.660 --> 15:58.660]  And they expect you to reach into certain sections.
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.660]  Go ahead, Mike. This is more your department.
[16:00.660 --> 16:05.660]  You input the information about your harvest into a computer program
[16:05.660 --> 16:10.660]  and it spits out a sampling diagram.
[16:10.660 --> 16:15.660]  And what you're supposed to do is follow the sampling diagram
[16:15.980 --> 16:19.980]  and say, if your plants are on a rack, it'll tell you rack one
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.980]  and then it'll have a diagram of a rack mapped out like a city.
[16:23.980 --> 16:26.980]  And it'll say in quadrant one, take a half gram sample
[16:26.980 --> 16:29.980]  and quadrant three, take a half gram sample.
[16:29.980 --> 16:35.980]  You'll do this eight times per rack and come up with a four gram sample to send to the lab.
[16:35.980 --> 16:37.980]  That's how it's supposed to be done.
[16:37.980 --> 16:38.980]  Supposed to be.
[16:38.980 --> 16:43.980]  What a lot of people do is take the choicest four grams they can find
[16:44.300 --> 16:47.300]  in their sampling section and send that.
[16:47.300 --> 16:51.300]  Because what's most desirable for the consumer is a high THC number.
[16:51.300 --> 16:53.300]  That's all that matters.
[16:53.300 --> 16:56.300]  Unfortunately, for probably, I don't even want to guess the percentage,
[16:56.300 --> 17:00.300]  a large portion of the consumer says, what's your highest THC?
[17:00.300 --> 17:02.300]  That's their first question when they walk in.
[17:02.300 --> 17:05.300]  So we need the highest test we can get out of this product.
[17:05.300 --> 17:11.300]  The company is looking for the highest testing sample that's going to pass the test.
[17:11.620 --> 17:15.620]  And so hopefully most companies are following the diagram
[17:15.620 --> 17:21.620]  because that's the best way the state's come up with so far to ensure that products clean.
[17:21.620 --> 17:29.620]  But once your sample has passed or you've got that strain passed three or four, five, six times
[17:29.620 --> 17:34.620]  over a certain time period, you don't have to test it again for half a year or more.
[17:34.620 --> 17:35.620]  Are there ways to cheat?
[17:35.620 --> 17:39.620]  And do you think people can cheat or do cheat sample testing?
[17:39.620 --> 17:40.620]  Yes, yes, and yes.
[17:40.940 --> 17:44.940]  There are, I mean, it's just like anything.
[17:44.940 --> 17:46.940]  There's an infinite number of ways to cheat.
[17:46.940 --> 17:48.940]  It's like a speed limit.
[17:49.940 --> 17:58.940]  There's a number of ways that you can, I mean, I'm pretty sure most grows
[17:59.940 --> 18:02.940]  do the best they can to pick the best four gram sample.
[18:02.940 --> 18:05.940]  Some grows have no idea when I ask them, how do you do your testing?
[18:05.940 --> 18:07.940]  They go, we just grab stuff just like it says.
[18:07.940 --> 18:08.940]  I'm like, oh, do you clean it up?
[18:09.260 --> 18:10.260]  Do you do anything special?
[18:10.260 --> 18:11.260]  And they go, nope.
[18:11.260 --> 18:15.260]  Some of them, I find it amazing that they just send a sample just like normal.
[18:15.260 --> 18:18.260]  But there are many ways to manipulate those samples to increase potency.
[18:18.260 --> 18:22.260]  There are ways to make sure that you don't have microbes on there.
[18:22.260 --> 18:27.260]  I know testing well enough to spot bullshit when I'm flipping through a stack of tests
[18:27.260 --> 18:29.260]  and I'll see it online.
[18:29.260 --> 18:34.260]  I just saw someone I kind of respect talking about a 40% pre-roll.
[18:34.260 --> 18:37.260]  And I was like, well, that's at least 12% Keef.
[18:37.580 --> 18:42.580]  At least it's just, there are certain things that once you do this for a while,
[18:42.580 --> 18:44.580]  you can spot nonsense.
[18:44.580 --> 18:47.580]  And so clearly the process is being manipulated.
[18:47.580 --> 18:52.580]  But I mean, even when it's done honestly, and that's sort of what I hope,
[18:52.580 --> 18:55.580]  like when I ran it, I ran it as honest as I could.
[18:55.580 --> 18:58.580]  And that pissed off some of the people above me.
[18:59.580 --> 19:01.580]  And we still had killer lab tests.
[19:01.580 --> 19:03.580]  Yeah, we still had good lab tests.
[19:03.900 --> 19:09.900]  But not everyone is going to do their best to follow the sample polling method.
[19:09.900 --> 19:12.900]  But even if they do follow the sample polling method,
[19:12.900 --> 19:15.900]  once a strain becomes process validated,
[19:15.900 --> 19:18.900]  it doesn't get tested again for at least a couple of months.
[19:18.900 --> 19:23.900]  And knowing how easy it is for these tests to fail,
[19:24.900 --> 19:30.900]  I mean, you can have 50 samples and two of them will fail for no identifiable reason.
[19:31.220 --> 19:33.220]  It's just two of those strains.
[19:33.220 --> 19:35.220]  They were all in the same room.
[19:35.220 --> 19:37.220]  Nothing different for anything.
[19:37.220 --> 19:40.220]  It's just two of them, two of the samples came back dirty.
[19:40.220 --> 19:45.220]  It could have been the person taking the test sample handling it.
[19:45.220 --> 19:47.220]  That person could have sneezed in the room.
[19:47.220 --> 19:49.220]  A sneeze, a deep exhalation.
[19:49.220 --> 19:50.220]  A deep exhale.
[19:50.220 --> 19:51.220]  This right here.
[19:51.220 --> 19:54.220]  So if you've got, let's hypothetically, my microphone cover right now
[19:54.220 --> 19:56.220]  is a bud that we're going to send for sample.
[19:56.220 --> 19:57.220]  I'm going to wipe it off.
[19:57.220 --> 19:59.220]  Right now, this is a sterile bud.
[19:59.220 --> 20:00.220]  It's clean.
[20:00.540 --> 20:01.540]  It's worn a glove.
[20:01.540 --> 20:02.540]  It's been treated well in the growth.
[20:02.540 --> 20:04.540]  Right now, this bud passes microbial testing.
[20:04.540 --> 20:08.540]  But then, now it fails yeast testing.
[20:08.540 --> 20:10.540]  My breath, I know that sounds disgusting.
[20:10.540 --> 20:11.540]  Your breath does it too, asshole.
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.540]  It's not just me.
[20:12.540 --> 20:16.540]  Our breath carries enough funk and mold and yeast and different microbes
[20:16.540 --> 20:19.540]  that it will make that bud fail the test.
[20:19.540 --> 20:21.540]  That's how sensitive that test is.
[20:21.540 --> 20:25.540]  It allows for two times the yeast that is in the air naturally.
[20:25.540 --> 20:27.540]  And that is not very much.
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.860]  I imagine that if we went to New York where they make that delicious
[20:30.860 --> 20:33.860]  New York pizza crust, everything would probably fail because there's
[20:33.860 --> 20:34.860]  probably that much.
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.860]  They're having a lot of trouble in Boston.
[20:36.860 --> 20:39.860]  There's that much yeast and shit in the air already because of just
[20:39.860 --> 20:40.860]  what it is there.
[20:40.860 --> 20:42.860]  So it's really easy to fail that test.
[20:42.860 --> 20:45.860]  There are a couple things that I assume could be happening.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.860]  And I may be jumping over you, Mike.
[20:47.860 --> 20:49.860]  But people could be cheating the tests.
[20:49.860 --> 20:52.860]  People could be doing something to the sample that they're sending
[20:52.860 --> 20:54.860]  that they're not doing to the full batch.
[20:54.860 --> 20:55.860]  That's making it to the store.
[20:56.180 --> 20:57.180]  And now it gets tested.
[20:57.180 --> 20:59.180]  It's obviously going to fail because they cheated with the test.
[20:59.180 --> 21:03.180]  Or do you think that possibly those buds, those products,
[21:03.180 --> 21:05.180]  completely passed testing?
[21:05.180 --> 21:07.180]  They got sent to the store and they were cool.
[21:07.180 --> 21:08.180]  But they've been in a jar.
[21:08.180 --> 21:11.180]  And what happens to the jar at the dispensary all day long?
[21:11.180 --> 21:15.180]  They pop open the jar and they stick it right under my nose.
[21:15.180 --> 21:17.180]  And I take a big ass breath in.
[21:17.180 --> 21:20.180]  And then I exhale right into that damn jar.
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.180]  That smells good.
[21:22.180 --> 21:24.180]  And then I do it again.
[21:24.180 --> 21:25.180]  Unless I don't like it.
[21:25.500 --> 21:27.500]  If I really like it, I'll take two or three of those.
[21:27.500 --> 21:28.500]  And I'll blow right back into it.
[21:28.500 --> 21:29.500]  You don't think about doing it.
[21:29.500 --> 21:31.500]  But what if you got a cold?
[21:31.500 --> 21:33.500]  What if you're a fucking mouth breather?
[21:33.500 --> 21:34.500]  I don't know.
[21:34.500 --> 21:37.500]  Right into that jar all day long.
[21:37.500 --> 21:41.500]  There's a couple of things in this story that make me think
[21:41.500 --> 21:50.500]  most or all of this is honest mistakes or issues with the process validation procedures.
[21:50.500 --> 21:53.500]  The companies were issued a letter saying,
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.820]  they were going to be checking.
[21:55.820 --> 21:58.820]  Every company in Denver got one.
[21:58.820 --> 22:01.820]  Which means all of their suppliers, even if they're outside of Denver,
[22:01.820 --> 22:03.820]  heard about it.
[22:03.820 --> 22:07.820]  Which means everybody knew this was coming two months in advance.
[22:07.820 --> 22:11.820]  And I don't know about you, but if somebody tells me they're going to come up
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.820]  and see if my room's clean at noon,
[22:13.820 --> 22:15.820]  you know what I mean.
[22:15.820 --> 22:18.820]  You know you've got an inspection on Wednesday.
[22:18.820 --> 22:20.820]  On Tuesday, before everybody goes home,
[22:21.140 --> 22:24.140]  the last thing you do is make sure everything's tippy top.
[22:24.140 --> 22:31.140]  And so if people were cheating the testing or specifically manipulating the system
[22:31.140 --> 22:35.140]  to put product that wouldn't pass testing on to store shelves,
[22:35.140 --> 22:40.140]  they would have, at least in my mind, known that they were doing that
[22:40.140 --> 22:42.140]  and taken steps to make sure that,
[22:42.140 --> 22:45.140]  oh shit, we've been breaking the rules.
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.140]  They're going to come check.
[22:46.140 --> 22:50.140]  We got to make sure all of that product's in the safe for the next couple of months.
[22:50.460 --> 22:53.460]  And only put out stuff we know is going to pass muster.
[22:53.460 --> 22:55.460]  Even super shitty restaurants pass inspections
[22:55.460 --> 22:57.460]  because the health department tells you when they're coming.
[23:00.460 --> 23:03.460]  Because so many tests failed
[23:03.460 --> 23:06.460]  and because of some of the other factors that I know are in play,
[23:06.460 --> 23:09.460]  like the product shortage, process validation,
[23:09.460 --> 23:12.460]  Colorado shitty weather, environmental control issues,
[23:13.460 --> 23:19.460]  my guess is that this is just an issue we've identified in our lab testing process.
[23:19.780 --> 23:24.780]  And they also start in the article by saying that this was part of an educational experience for everybody.
[23:24.780 --> 23:25.780]  It's kind of something that they say.
[23:25.780 --> 23:27.780]  Well, we don't even have the report yet.
[23:27.780 --> 23:32.780]  So we don't know how many tests were run, how many failed, what they failed for.
[23:33.780 --> 23:38.780]  And my guess is that the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment
[23:38.780 --> 23:44.780]  is going to take further steps to investigate the samples that failed.
[23:44.780 --> 23:47.780]  In Colorado, that's not just something that we're like,
[23:48.100 --> 23:50.100]  we're going to do more failed testing, try harder next time.
[23:50.100 --> 23:53.100]  There's a lot of stuff that happens after the failure.
[23:53.100 --> 23:57.100]  We'll find out how many of those samples failed for yeast or mold
[23:57.100 --> 23:59.100]  or possibly powdery mildew.
[23:59.100 --> 24:02.100]  Or unfortunately, there are things like E. coli that are available
[24:02.100 --> 24:04.100]  that are happening in cannabis.
[24:04.100 --> 24:07.100]  We also may find that some of them are held for pesticides
[24:07.100 --> 24:09.100]  because it did mention pesticides in the article.
[24:10.100 --> 24:13.100]  When we get to see how they did the inspection,
[24:13.420 --> 24:21.420]  my guess is they sent inspectors to 25 randomly selected stores in Denver
[24:21.420 --> 24:25.420]  and had them buy a certain number of samples at each store.
[24:26.420 --> 24:30.420]  If you picture an inspector, that's his job all day.
[24:30.420 --> 24:33.420]  He shows up to work on Monday and gets his assignment for the day.
[24:33.420 --> 24:36.420]  He's got to go to six weed stores and buy three samples at each store.
[24:37.420 --> 24:42.420]  He doesn't know walking in as a customer unless he really quizzes the buttenders.
[24:43.420 --> 24:45.420]  Which wholesalers produce that herb?
[24:45.420 --> 24:48.420]  All that stuff is going to come out in the aggregate.
[24:48.420 --> 24:53.420]  When we get a look at the data, we'll see if this is an issue with the production line,
[24:53.420 --> 24:57.420]  if it's an issue with the packaging, if it's an issue with storage at the store
[24:57.420 --> 24:59.420]  or handling at the store.
[24:59.420 --> 25:00.420]  We're going to learn a lot from this.
[25:00.420 --> 25:01.420]  Exactly.
[25:02.420 --> 25:07.420]  Depending on what the tests find, that's going to mean a lot to those growers
[25:07.420 --> 25:08.420]  and how it's handled.
[25:08.420 --> 25:12.420]  If it's powdery mildew that they passed on, shame the fuck on you.
[25:13.420 --> 25:15.420]  If it's bud rot, shame the fuck on you.
[25:15.420 --> 25:19.420]  If it's mold or yeast that you can't even detect with the naked eye,
[25:19.420 --> 25:21.420]  you've got to have a lab test for that.
[25:21.420 --> 25:25.420]  If I passed on a bud that failed the yeast test, I couldn't feel bad
[25:25.420 --> 25:27.420]  because there's no way I could have known.
[25:27.420 --> 25:29.420]  We can't be too upset at them for that.
[25:29.420 --> 25:30.420]  That's a learning experience.
[25:30.420 --> 25:33.420]  But if it's powdery mildew or bud rot, that's something we've got to do.
[25:33.420 --> 25:36.420]  There should be some sort of course of action for that sort of shit,
[25:36.420 --> 25:37.420]  at least corrective action.
[25:37.740 --> 25:46.740]  This is one of the bigger hurdles to legalization for the existing community
[25:46.740 --> 25:47.740]  to get over.
[25:47.740 --> 25:51.740]  The moving all the way into a fully legal regulated market.
[25:51.740 --> 25:56.740]  When you buy a can of Pepsi, it doesn't matter which state you're standing in.
[25:56.740 --> 25:57.740]  You know what the fuck you're getting.
[25:57.740 --> 25:59.740]  You know it's not going to kill you.
[26:00.740 --> 26:03.740]  That's how cannabis will be before I die.
[26:04.060 --> 26:07.060]  Getting there is so, so difficult.
[26:07.060 --> 26:11.060]  Should that can of Pepsi kill you, you flip it over and there's a number on the back
[26:11.060 --> 26:15.060]  that says it was made at this location at this time and this batch.
[26:15.060 --> 26:17.060]  They know which batch of Pepsi to find.
[26:17.060 --> 26:19.060]  That's a terrible product anyway, so I'm glad we went with that.
[26:19.060 --> 26:21.060]  They know which batch it was.
[26:21.060 --> 26:22.060]  They know which stores that went to.
[26:22.060 --> 26:24.060]  They know where to go recall it from.
[26:24.060 --> 26:30.060]  In Colorado now, we've gotten to that point where if I bought a legal cannabis product
[26:30.380 --> 26:35.380]  and got sick and went to a doctor and said, you know, these are my symptoms.
[26:35.380 --> 26:37.380]  This is what I think did it.
[26:37.380 --> 26:41.380]  Like I bought a bag of herb that had some mold on it and smoked it anyway.
[26:41.380 --> 26:42.380]  Now I'm sick.
[26:43.380 --> 26:44.380]  They're able to track that.
[26:44.380 --> 26:46.380]  Well, I bought it at this store.
[26:46.380 --> 26:48.380]  This is where the growth was produced at.
[26:48.380 --> 26:50.380]  This is the batch it was harvested from.
[26:50.380 --> 26:52.380]  I just grabbed some concentrate off the table.
[26:53.380 --> 26:55.380]  On the back here, it's got RMCF.
[26:55.380 --> 26:58.380]  That's recreational marijuana cultivation facility.
[26:58.700 --> 27:00.700]  The number starts with 403R-.
[27:00.700 --> 27:03.700]  I'm not going to read you the number because that's none of your business.
[27:03.700 --> 27:06.700]  That is where the flower that made this concentrate was grown.
[27:06.700 --> 27:07.700]  You can track it all the way back.
[27:07.700 --> 27:08.700]  I know where this was grown.
[27:09.700 --> 27:14.700]  Also, there should be an accompanying MSDS sheet for every product that was put into this.
[27:14.700 --> 27:21.700]  Also, there should be a Department of Agriculture pesticide log for every product that was sprayed or applied to this.
[27:21.700 --> 27:23.700]  There's a lot of history that comes with that number.
[27:24.020 --> 27:29.020]  If you are part of the MED or any type of inspector, you can find a lot of information.
[27:29.020 --> 27:32.020]  I know a lot of information by these numbers just because of my experience.
[27:32.020 --> 27:46.020]  All of this information and all of the lab testing that we do in Colorado is why we know our legal industry isn't a culprit in the vaping illness thing that's going around right now.
[27:47.020 --> 27:51.020]  We know for a fact it's not Colorado's legal marijuana industry that's making people sick.
[27:51.340 --> 27:53.340]  I've got a cultivation.
[27:53.340 --> 27:55.340]  I've got a medically infused product number.
[27:55.340 --> 27:57.340]  On the back, I've also got a batch number here.
[27:58.340 --> 28:00.340]  We've got a lot of details on this product.
[28:00.340 --> 28:03.340]  I could probably tell you which plant numbers went into there.
[28:03.340 --> 28:06.340]  That means in the cultivation, there are probably a thousand plants.
[28:06.340 --> 28:09.340]  I'm just going to guess in this cultivation where these flowers came from.
[28:09.340 --> 28:16.340]  I can tell you which plant numbers from that cultivation were turned into this concentrate if we follow the numbers correctly.
[28:16.340 --> 28:18.340]  If they did the numbers correctly.
[28:18.340 --> 28:19.340]  This company, I trust.
[28:19.340 --> 28:20.340]  That's why I buy their stuff.
[28:20.660 --> 28:22.660]  I know their pesticide logs are accurate.
[28:22.660 --> 28:24.660]  I know all their numbers are legit.
[28:24.660 --> 28:25.660]  That's part of why I go with them.
[28:26.660 --> 28:32.660]  There's a lot about the testing in Colorado or in every legal state that a lot of people don't realize.
[28:33.660 --> 28:37.660]  Most people don't think about lab testing and how that gets performed on everyday products.
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.660]  It just doesn't occur to us to think down that rabbit hole.
[28:41.660 --> 28:48.660]  Most people that I've talked to assume legal cannabis gets lab tested at the same place they lab test everything else.
[28:48.980 --> 29:02.980]  That would make sense, but because of the federal law, every legal state literally has to create their own special testing labs that only test that state's legal cannabis products.
[29:03.980 --> 29:06.980]  They have to build that whole thing from the ground up.
[29:07.980 --> 29:12.980]  Normally, it's like, just follow the layout for opening a testing lab that would test anything else.
[29:13.980 --> 29:16.980]  You can't because step two is apply for the DEA license.
[29:17.300 --> 29:27.300]  If you tell the DEA you're about to open a testing lab that tests cannabis samples for a state's legal cannabis industry, they show up with machine guns and steal your computers.
[29:28.300 --> 29:32.300]  That literally happened the first time Colorado started doing this.
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.300]  We've literally had to build all of this from the ground up.
[29:38.300 --> 29:46.300]  Because of the federal law with cannabis, we're literally inventing the wheel right now in real time.
[29:47.300 --> 29:49.300]  When it comes to lab testing and legal production.
[29:50.300 --> 29:56.300]  We did this with edibles already when the newspapers went around and bought up edibles samples.
[29:57.300 --> 29:59.300]  It was a black eye for the industry.
[30:00.300 --> 30:01.300]  A lot of people got smacked.
[30:02.300 --> 30:06.300]  Six months later, how much better was the edibles side of the industry?
[30:07.300 --> 30:09.300]  Now the edible market is amazing now.
[30:09.620 --> 30:19.620]  The lab testing component to this has been a real slow, ugly nightmare to get into place.
[30:20.620 --> 30:21.620]  But we're getting there.
[30:22.620 --> 30:26.620]  In a couple of more test runs like they're doing right now, it'll really be in place.
[30:27.620 --> 30:33.620]  When you go to any cannabis store that's legal and licensed in Colorado, you'll be able to be totally confident in what you're buying.
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.620]  Right now, you can be pretty confident.
[30:35.940 --> 30:40.940]  I'm fairly confident that if I buy an edible right now, it will be as potent as they say it.
[30:41.940 --> 30:43.940]  They do allow a plus or minus 10% variance.
[30:44.940 --> 30:47.940]  So if you're buying a 15 mg edible, that makes me a little sketchy.
[30:48.940 --> 30:50.940]  But I don't buy a 15, I buy a 100 or a 350 is what I purchase.
[30:51.940 --> 30:54.940]  I know I'm going to get at least a 100 or 350 out of that bad bitch.
[30:55.940 --> 30:56.940]  It's going to be alright for me.
[30:57.940 --> 31:00.940]  Do you want to segue into this next bullet point I've got that says black market?
[31:01.940 --> 31:02.940]  Sure.
[31:03.260 --> 31:07.260]  I found it really entertaining on social media that people were making the comment that,
[31:08.260 --> 31:09.260]  oh, the weed at the dispensary is moldy.
[31:10.260 --> 31:11.260]  That's why I buy black market.
[31:12.260 --> 31:16.260]  The comments I saw were all, a lot of the anti-pop people,
[31:17.260 --> 31:19.260]  every time they see a recall or something like this, they're like,
[31:20.260 --> 31:21.260]  see regulation doesn't work.
[31:22.260 --> 31:23.260]  And it's like, this is regulation working.
[31:24.260 --> 31:25.260]  This is how it's supposed to happen.
[31:26.260 --> 31:29.260]  You just take the marijuana out of it and it makes it easier for people to understand.
[31:30.260 --> 31:32.260]  The cantaloupe place made some cantaloupes.
[31:33.260 --> 31:35.260]  A couple of those cantaloupes didn't look right.
[31:36.260 --> 31:37.260]  They got tested.
[31:38.260 --> 31:41.260]  We back solved the problem, had to pull some cantaloupes off the shelf.
[31:42.260 --> 31:44.260]  That's regulation keeping consumers safe.
[31:45.260 --> 31:46.260]  It just happened with a bunch of romaine lettuce.
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.260]  You don't see a bunch of activists going, oh, ban all the lettuce.
[31:50.260 --> 31:52.260]  They finally got all those Volkswagen's off the side of the highway,
[31:53.260 --> 31:56.260]  a little north of here from that big recall from three or four years ago.
[31:57.260 --> 31:58.260]  That's a random thing to share with people.
[31:58.580 --> 32:03.580]  We live about 20 miles south of a Volkswagen graveyard.
[32:04.580 --> 32:08.580]  It was a Volkswagen, brand new car, so it was extra creepy.
[32:09.580 --> 32:11.580]  They had to have security guards driving around it to protect that shit.
[32:12.580 --> 32:16.580]  Thousands of recalled Volkswagens parked in very organized fashion
[32:17.580 --> 32:20.580]  in this giant field with security guards just roaming the aisles.
[32:21.580 --> 32:24.580]  It looked like a full sporting event stadium for a major football game.
[32:25.580 --> 32:26.580]  It looked like a Volkswagen car dealership, basically.
[32:26.900 --> 32:28.900]  There's just no people and no sporting event.
[32:29.900 --> 32:31.900]  There's a couple of security guards doing loops.
[32:32.900 --> 32:33.900]  Yeah, because those were all decent cars.
[32:34.900 --> 32:36.900]  But they finally figured that shit out and finally got those moved off the side.
[32:37.900 --> 32:39.900]  I mean, recalls happen in every industry all the time.
[32:40.900 --> 32:41.900]  This is regulation working.
[32:42.900 --> 32:45.900]  We're literally creating something that we've been told
[32:46.900 --> 32:47.900]  we weren't allowed to try to create for 80 years.
[32:48.900 --> 32:52.900]  There's going to be baby steps backwards and there's going to be fuck ups
[32:53.220 --> 32:57.220]  and there's going to be things that we have to stop and scratch out and rewrite.
[32:58.220 --> 33:02.220]  And that rewriting and rethinking step is where Colorado is right now.
[33:03.220 --> 33:07.220]  We're past talking about if we should do this
[33:08.220 --> 33:13.220]  and we've moved on completely to this is how we decided to do this.
[33:14.220 --> 33:18.220]  Let's start taking a look at the rules and regs we put in place originally
[33:19.220 --> 33:22.220]  and start evaluating each one of those rules independently
[33:23.220 --> 33:28.220]  if it's too harsh, not strict enough, too strict, or if we got it right.
[33:29.220 --> 33:33.220]  And with the lab testing, clearly we don't have that process right yet.
[33:34.220 --> 33:35.220]  But we're getting there.
[33:36.220 --> 33:38.220]  We already did this with edibles and now the edibles in Colorado are on point.
[33:39.220 --> 33:41.220]  Now, if the dispensaries aren't getting it right,
[33:42.220 --> 33:45.220]  imagine what your home grower that isn't educated is doing to you.
[33:46.220 --> 33:50.220]  There's literally zero protections in the black market.
[33:50.540 --> 33:56.540]  And there's this weird thing that happens where I'm trusting you to sell me pot.
[33:57.540 --> 34:01.540]  You're trusting me to buy pot from you and we're both trusting each other
[34:02.540 --> 34:04.540]  not to say anything about this to anyone official.
[34:05.540 --> 34:08.540]  I mean, it's cool if I tell my friend that I know a guy that I can get herb from.
[34:09.540 --> 34:13.540]  It's not cool if I tell a cop to go to my guy's house and bust him.
[34:14.540 --> 34:18.540]  But because there's that implied trust, even if we don't really know each other,
[34:18.860 --> 34:21.860]  hey, I'm going to provide this service for you.
[34:22.860 --> 34:24.860]  You're going to enjoy this service from me.
[34:25.860 --> 34:28.860]  We're not going to get each other in trouble about it, but we're going to break the law together.
[34:29.860 --> 34:32.860]  Like if two people were going to go commit almost any other type of crime,
[34:33.860 --> 34:37.860]  the level of relationship and trust has to be a lot greater.
[34:38.860 --> 34:43.860]  And in the cannabis industry, it's very chill.
[34:44.860 --> 34:45.860]  It's very laid back.
[34:46.180 --> 34:53.180]  It's typically non-aggressive and non-violent until the rest of the black market world comes into play.
[34:54.180 --> 34:59.180]  And so for most people, it face value when they're interacting with their cannabis supplier.
[35:00.180 --> 35:05.180]  It's friendly, it's lighthearted, and there's a lot of trust in that relationship.
[35:06.180 --> 35:10.180]  But none of that applies to quality of product and lab testing.
[35:11.180 --> 35:13.180]  The guy selling you herb just wants you to continue buying herb.
[35:13.500 --> 35:16.500]  And as long as you're going to do that, end of story.
[35:17.500 --> 35:20.500]  Whatever has to get sprayed, whatever has to get applied.
[35:21.500 --> 35:25.500]  If you walk in the door and say, hey, do you have Snickle Fritz?
[35:26.500 --> 35:28.500]  Yeah, sure. I've got to go get it out of the other room.
[35:29.500 --> 35:31.500]  And they grab the bag of Blue Dream, write Snickle Fritz on a different bag,
[35:32.500 --> 35:34.500]  you throw a handful in there, tell you this is their last quarter of it,
[35:35.500 --> 35:37.500]  and they're hooking you up special for only $20 more.
[35:37.820 --> 35:41.820]  I was talking to somebody on another podcast about the state of the black market.
[35:42.820 --> 35:45.820]  And they were asking about black market in individual areas.
[35:46.820 --> 35:49.820]  And so I was talking about in Colorado, there is a black market,
[35:50.820 --> 35:53.820]  but it is not as prevalent as many other places because we've got so many options for dispensaries
[35:54.820 --> 35:56.820]  with lab tests and other quality options.
[35:57.820 --> 36:01.820]  And so somebody left the comment that I'm corporate cannabis now and I'm against the black market.
[36:02.820 --> 36:03.820]  That's not what I was saying.
[36:04.140 --> 36:07.140]  I was saying that there aren't many black market dealers around here
[36:08.140 --> 36:09.140]  because there are so many dispensaries.
[36:10.140 --> 36:13.140]  So let me start my little rant by saying I am not against the black market.
[36:14.140 --> 36:16.140]  I came from the black market. If that didn't exist, I would not be here.
[36:17.140 --> 36:18.140]  That used to be the home market.
[36:19.140 --> 36:21.140]  Yeah, and the free market, the gray market, whatever you want to call it,
[36:22.140 --> 36:24.140]  we know what it is, the non-regulated market, the homey market.
[36:25.140 --> 36:27.140]  I'm from there. So don't think that I'm against that.
[36:28.140 --> 36:31.140]  All I was saying is that's not available here so much.
[36:32.140 --> 36:33.140]  There's no need for that.
[36:34.140 --> 36:38.140]  If my mom wanted a topical, she's not going to go to the dude down the street
[36:39.140 --> 36:42.140]  and hang out at his house and watch him play Xbox until he gives her some fucking topical.
[36:43.140 --> 36:44.140]  She's going to go to the dispensary. She's going to walk in.
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.140]  She's going to pay cash. She's going to leave. It's over.
[36:47.140 --> 36:48.140]  She needs a couple of topicals to make her hands feel better.
[36:49.140 --> 36:51.140]  She'll be just fine. That's the kind of market we've got here.
[36:52.140 --> 36:55.140]  Then I was going to go on what Mike was saying about we just trust each other.
[36:56.140 --> 36:59.140]  I'm all about the, if you've got a friend who is in the free market
[37:00.140 --> 37:01.140]  and you were supporting him, that's awesome.
[37:02.140 --> 37:03.140]  I love friends supporting friends. Do your thing.
[37:04.140 --> 37:07.140]  But maybe one day kindly ask him, so what are you using for pesticides, bro?
[37:08.140 --> 37:11.140]  Don't, don't ask him accusingly. Don't make it look like you're worried.
[37:12.140 --> 37:15.140]  Maybe just bring it up. Just be like, what do you use for pesticides?
[37:16.140 --> 37:17.140]  Or what do you use for pest control?
[37:18.140 --> 37:19.140]  Compliment him that the weed is good.
[37:20.140 --> 37:22.140]  And then be like, what are you doing to keep the bugs away?
[37:23.140 --> 37:25.140]  Or what kind of nutrients do you use? Learn about the product that you're smoking.
[37:26.140 --> 37:27.140]  How long is your flush?
[37:28.140 --> 37:29.140]  Yeah. How long are you? Well, you'll know if the product burns well or not.
[37:30.140 --> 37:32.140]  But there's people say that the black market...
[37:32.460 --> 37:33.460]  Some people don't.
[37:34.460 --> 37:37.460]  It's just, it's what they've been exposed to what they've been around and what they've had access to.
[37:38.460 --> 37:40.460]  Yeah. But people, I'm not against the black market.
[37:41.460 --> 37:44.460]  You guys, we just, how do you, people say that the black market is better than the regulated market.
[37:45.460 --> 37:46.460]  How do you know? They've never been tested.
[37:47.460 --> 37:48.460]  Those guys may not be educated.
[37:49.460 --> 37:50.460]  And I'm not dissing any black market grower.
[37:51.460 --> 37:52.460]  In the legal market, I train people.
[37:53.460 --> 37:54.460]  I am a trainer.
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.460]  I train them on pesticide safety, pesticide handling.
[37:58.460 --> 38:00.460]  We follow a lot. Go ahead, Mike. Fix that.
[38:00.780 --> 38:05.780]  We follow a lot of regulation to make sure that the product is not moldy, that the product is not funky.
[38:06.780 --> 38:07.780]  All right. Mike's getting a call. We've got to wrap this up.
[38:08.780 --> 38:09.780]  That is the get the hell out of here signal.
[38:10.780 --> 38:11.780]  Yeah. We've got like, that's like the five minute warning.
[38:12.780 --> 38:16.780]  But the black market exists because the legal market can't.
[38:17.780 --> 38:19.780]  And like, think about the rest of your life.
[38:20.780 --> 38:21.780]  Do you buy your shoes on the black market?
[38:22.780 --> 38:23.780]  Like, do you?
[38:24.780 --> 38:25.780]  I don't want no knockoffs.
[38:26.780 --> 38:27.780]  Do you buy your t-shirts on the black market?
[38:28.780 --> 38:29.780]  Do you buy your groceries on the black market?
[38:30.780 --> 38:31.780]  Do you buy your headphones on the black market?
[38:32.780 --> 38:37.780]  When you want a new laptop, do you hang out in the Best Buy parking lot until you see the dude walk up out front with the used laptop?
[38:38.780 --> 38:41.780]  Or do you just walk the fuck into Best Buy and talk to the Geek Squad guys?
[38:42.780 --> 38:54.780]  It gets almost nothing Americans buy or people anywhere on the planet buy is from the black market because the legal regulated market is infinitely superior in every way.
[38:55.780 --> 38:58.780]  Except sometimes cost.
[38:59.100 --> 39:08.100]  And right now, the cannabis community, like I came from a pure black market world.
[39:09.100 --> 39:10.100]  There was no other.
[39:11.100 --> 39:19.100]  And then when we were 18, 19, Cali went medical and it changed the conversation.
[39:20.100 --> 39:22.100]  All of a sudden there were medical marijuana jokes in movies.
[39:23.100 --> 39:24.100]  Like, is that for your glaucoma?
[39:24.420 --> 39:31.420]  And the world fucking started to change and we slowly started to take baby steps into the legal market.
[39:32.420 --> 39:36.420]  And there's a million reasons why the existing community and market is resistant to it.
[39:37.420 --> 39:43.420]  But from a consumer standpoint, there's only one reason to continue to shop with the black market.
[39:44.420 --> 39:51.420]  And that's the reason why most of the growers we knew that operated back then are working in the legal market in some fashion now.
[39:51.740 --> 39:53.740]  A lot of us did head right over to the legal market.
[39:54.740 --> 39:57.740]  Or immediately moved to a state that hadn't changed their laws yet.
[39:58.740 --> 40:00.740]  Like, I know a lot of people that moved east when Colorado went legal.
[40:01.740 --> 40:04.740]  I know a lot of people that came here when this place went legal.
[40:05.740 --> 40:15.740]  Yeah, there were growers on the east coast that were dying to get legal came here and growers here that would rather make a black market price per pound or per ounce moved east.
[40:16.740 --> 40:17.740]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[40:18.740 --> 40:19.740]  Because this product is not worth much here.
[40:20.060 --> 40:22.060]  All right, Mike, let's get wrapping up to get you out of here.
[40:23.060 --> 40:24.060]  I support the free market.
[40:25.060 --> 40:26.060]  Do what you got to do.
[40:27.060 --> 40:28.060]  If you got somebody that's helping you out, let them do that.
[40:29.060 --> 40:30.060]  I'm not going to bash on anybody.
[40:31.060 --> 40:32.060]  I am not against the black market.
[40:33.060 --> 40:34.060]  Like somebody said that I was.
[40:35.060 --> 40:36.060]  I was almost offended.
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.060]  I think you can feel that I was almost offended that somebody said that.
[40:39.060 --> 40:40.060]  I was like, that's not what I meant at all by that conversation.
[40:41.060 --> 40:42.060]  So they're probably listening to this conversation now.
[40:43.060 --> 40:45.060]  So, dude, I hope you realize I'm not all against the black market.
[40:46.060 --> 40:47.060]  I'm not corporate cannabis.
[40:48.060 --> 40:49.060]  I came from that black market.
[40:50.060 --> 40:51.060]  So big love to the black.
[40:52.060 --> 40:56.060]  I don't have anything against the black market, but like people that drive don't have a lot of things against people to walk either.
[40:57.060 --> 40:58.060]  It's just there's a better way.
[40:59.060 --> 41:00.060]  Do your thing, Pimpin.
[41:01.060 --> 41:02.060]  Mike, thanks for hanging out, dude.
[41:03.060 --> 41:04.060]  Sorry, I got a bailout.
[41:05.060 --> 41:06.060]  No, I hope I didn't get you in trouble for keeping you for too long.
[41:07.060 --> 41:08.060]  No, we're good.
[41:09.060 --> 41:10.060]  Awesome.
[41:11.060 --> 41:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, smokers and growers, friends and foes, family, I'm a ding dong.

[43:00.020 --> 43:01.020]  I'm going to mute your mic so you can take that call, bro.
[43:04.020 --> 43:05.020]  He's got to get the fuck out of here.
[43:06.020 --> 43:07.020]  That's his alarm.
[43:08.020 --> 43:10.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to wrap up the podcast now.
[43:11.020 --> 43:12.020]  Mike, thanks for coming.
[43:13.020 --> 43:14.020]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[43:15.020 --> 43:16.020]  I want to give a giant shout out to our buddy, Matthew Dixon.
[43:17.020 --> 43:20.020]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[44:05.600 --> 44:07.600]  Sometimes I'm gonna walk the street
[44:08.600 --> 44:13.980]  A green sheet of glass
[44:14.980 --> 44:29.260]  I'll be with you girl
[44:30.260 --> 44:52.480]  A million poppies gonna make me sleep
[44:55.480 --> 44:58.480]  But just one rose, it knows your name
[45:01.480 --> 45:03.480]  A fruit is rusting on the vine
[45:06.480 --> 45:09.480]  A fruit is calling from the trees
[45:11.480 --> 45:14.480]  Hey, don't you wanna go down
[45:17.710 --> 45:19.710]  Like some junkie cosmonaut
[45:20.710 --> 46:18.540]  Blue, blue, blue, blue
[46:19.540 --> 46:25.660]  It's the sun down in the sky
[46:28.660 --> 46:31.660]  A green grain of her eyes
[46:33.660 --> 46:36.660]  A million miles, a million miles
[46:39.660 --> 46:42.660]  Hey, don't you wanna go down
[46:43.660 --> 46:45.660]  Like some junkie cosmonaut
[46:46.660 --> 46:48.660]  Blue, blue, blue, blue
[46:51.660 --> 46:53.660]  A green grain of her eyes
[46:54.660 --> 46:56.660]  A million miles, a million miles
[46:57.660 --> 46:59.660]  Hey, don't you wanna go down
[47:00.660 --> 47:02.660]  Like some junkie cosmonaut
[47:03.660 --> 47:05.660]  Blue, blue, blue, blue
[47:06.660 --> 47:08.660]  Hey, don't you wanna go down
[47:09.160 --> 47:10.660]  Like some junkie cosmonaut
