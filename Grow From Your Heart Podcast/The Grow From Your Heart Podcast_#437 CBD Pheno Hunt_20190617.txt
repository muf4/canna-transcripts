[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  Hey, welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:01.960 --> 00:06.280]  It is time for episode 437 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.280 --> 00:09.340]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.340 --> 00:13.840]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:13.840 --> 00:19.600]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.600 --> 00:23.800]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.800 --> 00:28.520]  It is Friday, I just came from the dispensary, and I have been smoking a large buffet of
[00:28.520 --> 00:30.240]  delicious concentrates.
[00:30.240 --> 00:35.680]  I've got some GG4 Ambrosia, I have some Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia, I have some Tropicana
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.640]  Cookies Ambrosia, and I've got some Stardog Batter that all taste amazing.
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.720]  I think my favorite is probably this Tropicana Lychee Ambrosia.
[00:45.720 --> 00:47.820]  This stuff tastes ridiculous.
[00:47.820 --> 00:52.780]  It smells like grapefruits, it smells like dish soap, and it smells like Smarty Candies.
[00:52.780 --> 00:54.480]  The dabs are tremendous.
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.120]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the buffet of delicious concentrates.
[01:00.120 --> 01:03.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, in this episode I'm going to
[01:03.400 --> 01:05.640]  read a couple of listener emails.
[01:05.640 --> 01:09.640]  Before we get to the emails, let's give some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:09.640 --> 01:13.360]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend Mike H. I want to give a gigantic Grow From
[01:13.360 --> 01:15.440]  Your Heart podcast shout out to my good friend Aldridge.
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.240]  How about a great big shout out to David OQ, a big shout out to Farmer John.
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.280]  I want to give a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Tanner M. I owe a giant
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.800]  Grow From Your Heart podcast handshake and a shout out to Richard Memel, and of course
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.520]  a giant shout out to our friend Glenn Jerome.

[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  campaign.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.920]  Okiddlydookidly podcast rolled at the start of the show.
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.520]  I said that I was going to read some listener emails.
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.360]  The first email in this episode goes just like this.
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.360]  What's up Rasta Chef?
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.320]  I'm living in prohibition land and I haven't grown in 15 years.
[02:05.320 --> 02:09.960]  I absolutely love the podcast and how informative and entertaining it is.
[02:09.960 --> 02:10.960]  Hey, thank you, man.
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.000]  I like the messages that start with compliments, so thanks a lot.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.440]  Recently, I've had some traumatic experiences that have given me extreme general anxiety
[02:19.440 --> 02:21.240]  and have given me PTSD.
[02:22.040 --> 02:24.400]  Honestly, though, I'm not concerned about me.
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.200]  I have a 5-year-old son that we see starting to have many, many problems with being on
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.520]  the spectrum with very high-functioning autism and extreme ADHD.
[02:34.520 --> 02:40.520]  I want to avoid him being prescribed harsh narcotics, so I want to get him into CBD.
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.480]  I have recently been reading about how CBD and how it could help my son, so I purchased
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.080]  some CBD tinctures legally here in New York.
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.200]  This has been a miracle for my anxiety and my PTSD.
[02:53.200 --> 02:56.720]  More importantly, it turns my son into a new kid.
[02:56.720 --> 02:57.720]  That is great to hear.
[02:57.720 --> 03:01.080]  Sometimes when you're purchasing CBD, you're not exactly sure what you're getting, so I'm
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.320]  glad you're getting a legal CBD product, and I'm delighted to hear that it's helping your
[03:06.320 --> 03:07.320]  son.
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.040]  When it fixes the kids, that always feels a little better.
[03:09.040 --> 03:12.480]  When you heal an adult, when an adult feels better, that feels great, but when you see
[03:12.480 --> 03:16.760]  a little kid just better, that just makes everybody feel better.
[03:16.760 --> 03:18.880]  Babies with little kids, those are always more heart-wrenching.
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.800]  Anything with a child just feels better, so I'm glad that your son is able to be himself
[03:22.800 --> 03:24.120]  and you're able to enjoy your son.
[03:24.120 --> 03:26.800]  That's going to build a better relationship for both of you that'll make both of your
[03:26.800 --> 03:27.880]  lives better.
[03:27.880 --> 03:29.740]  We see CBD helping already.
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.040]  This is a great message.
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.040]  It goes on to say, my son's teachers have asked me if he is on Adderall, and I say,
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.080]  nope, just CBD.
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.800]  I am amazed, and I now need to grow my own medicine for myself and my son because I can't
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.280]  afford these very expensive CBD oils.
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.800]  My question is, what strains would you recommend?
[03:49.800 --> 03:56.400]  I would like some CBD only and then some 1 to 1 ratio, and I'm sure he means 1 to 1 THC,
[03:56.400 --> 04:03.160]  1 to 1 CBD, and then a very high THC strain for myself and my fiancé, especially since
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.720]  I'm risking it for my son anyway.
[04:05.720 --> 04:11.320]  But seriously, if you know of any high THC strains that will help with PTSD, please let
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.440]  me know.
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.720]  I know you aren't an expert on making extracts, so I'll get that info elsewhere unless you
[04:16.720 --> 04:17.720]  have some input.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.680]  I follow you on all social medias since I haven't been able to become a patron.
[04:22.680 --> 04:23.680]  Hey, that's all right.
[04:23.680 --> 04:24.680]  Thanks for the great message.
[04:24.680 --> 04:26.240]  Thanks for following me on the social media.
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.080]  You don't have to become a patron for me to support you and help you out.
[04:29.080 --> 04:32.560]  It goes on to say, but I will soon, and I look forward to it.
[04:32.560 --> 04:34.900]  Thank you for bringing this community together.
[04:34.900 --> 04:38.420]  People like you are what's making this industry legitimate.
[04:38.420 --> 04:42.400]  And then he signs his message, and then it says, PS, been listening since before.
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.560]  I started growing again and before your dude grows episode, a true fan of your kindness
[04:47.560 --> 04:48.680]  and voice.
[04:48.680 --> 04:50.760]  I seriously love the podcast.
[04:50.760 --> 04:52.320]  Hey, that's a great message.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.640]  There is a lot of stuff to cover.
[04:53.640 --> 04:56.800]  Let's back up a few steps and talk about a couple of things.
[04:56.800 --> 05:02.800]  I love and respect the fact that you are stepping up to produce medicine to make your son and
[05:02.800 --> 05:05.440]  your entire family's life better.
[05:05.440 --> 05:08.480]  But you said earlier that you are in prohibition land.
[05:08.480 --> 05:13.960]  So one thing we need to weigh here is the cost of your safety.
[05:13.960 --> 05:18.480]  You are producing medicine to make yourself and your son's life better.
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.200]  Is that worth the risk?
[05:20.200 --> 05:25.720]  If you get caught, you may be removed from your son's life for quite a long time.
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.560]  There's another personal part in this message I did not read out loud.
[05:29.560 --> 05:32.560]  Imagine what would happen if you were removed from your son.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.180]  It would be in the hands of that other person you mentioned that I did not read about.
[05:36.180 --> 05:37.680]  That may not be the best outcome.
[05:37.680 --> 05:39.180]  It may not be what you want.
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.880]  So think about that.
[05:40.880 --> 05:41.960]  You need to weigh those options.
[05:41.960 --> 05:44.260]  Yes, I always say grow cannabis.
[05:44.260 --> 05:45.260]  Do that.
[05:45.260 --> 05:46.260]  You're an adult.
[05:46.260 --> 05:48.480]  But in this case, your son needs you.
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.560]  You may want to consider your options here.
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.620]  You do have the option to get that tincture.
[05:53.620 --> 05:55.440]  It is expensive.
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.020]  Growing is expensive.
[05:57.020 --> 05:58.200]  Equipment is expensive.
[05:58.200 --> 06:01.880]  The processing is going to take a lot of effort and a lot of equipment.
[06:01.880 --> 06:05.960]  And you could really screw it up and waste an entire crop, which means you just risked
[06:05.960 --> 06:10.240]  your freedom and your son's well-being for a crop that you accidentally destroyed.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.800]  I'm not trying to say you're going to do this.
[06:11.800 --> 06:16.080]  I'm just trying to put some thought into your head so you know very clearly what you're
[06:16.080 --> 06:18.120]  risking and you know your options.
[06:18.120 --> 06:19.280]  I just want to make that clear for you.
[06:19.280 --> 06:20.280]  It sounds like you're going to grow.
[06:20.280 --> 06:21.800]  It sounds like I probably can't sway you.
[06:21.800 --> 06:26.360]  But I want you to know that that tincture is available at a cost.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.760]  There's money.
[06:27.760 --> 06:31.400]  Money is expensive, but freedom is priceless.
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.780]  And if you are not around to help your son, you are not around to help your son at all.
[06:36.780 --> 06:40.080]  So it really sounds like you've got your heart set on growing cannabis.
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.920]  It sounds like you've already purchased some equipment and you're going to do it.
[06:42.920 --> 06:46.240]  So I will talk about some genetics that would help you out.
[06:46.240 --> 06:50.360]  But keep in mind, if there is tincture available that is already processed and you can buy
[06:50.360 --> 06:55.720]  it and it works and it did what you need done and it is already showing positive results,
[06:55.720 --> 07:00.440]  I may stick to that if it is illegal to grow in your area.
[07:00.480 --> 07:04.600]  That's something that I would stick with if it were me for the child's safety.
[07:04.600 --> 07:05.960]  That's what I would do.
[07:05.960 --> 07:07.380]  That's what I should recommend.
[07:07.380 --> 07:08.660]  I'm a cannabis grower.
[07:08.660 --> 07:09.660]  I'm a seed breeder.
[07:09.660 --> 07:11.320]  I'm a cannabis advocate.
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.480]  I'm a cannabis activist.
[07:12.480 --> 07:14.000]  I'm a cannabis spokesperson.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.780]  But before all of that, I'm a father.
[07:16.780 --> 07:20.160]  And if you made me choose one, you wouldn't see me do any more cannabis stuff.
[07:20.160 --> 07:22.640]  You'd just see me focused on that kid.
[07:22.640 --> 07:23.840]  She's 16.
[07:23.840 --> 07:25.240]  She needs a good father.
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.560]  I understand how important it is for us to be there.
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.080]  So that may be something to think about.
[07:29.080 --> 07:30.960]  I'm just coming from my fatherly side.
[07:30.960 --> 07:34.760]  Today is her birthday, so maybe it's weighing a little extra heavy on me today, but that
[07:34.760 --> 07:36.360]  is what I thought of first of all.
[07:36.360 --> 07:37.880]  Now, it sounds like you're going to grow.
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.040]  So if you're going to grow, if you're hard of said on it, or if there's somebody else
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.720]  out there who may want this information, let's talk about some CBD rich strains.
[07:45.720 --> 07:49.440]  I'll try to touch on some things that are known to be one to one, and then I will give
[07:49.440 --> 07:55.840]  some recommendations for strains that I believe are high THC and have worked well in PTSD
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.740]  applications.
[07:57.860 --> 08:01.580]  Something that pops into my head when I start thinking about pheno hunting for CBD rich
[08:01.580 --> 08:04.820]  phenotypes from a pack of seeds is lab testing.
[08:04.820 --> 08:07.160]  Do you have lab testing available?
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.060]  You're going to hypothetically acquire seeds and you will grow those seeds.
[08:12.060 --> 08:15.340]  The plants that come from those seeds will have different traits.
[08:15.340 --> 08:18.940]  The buds that come from those plants will have different medicinal qualities.
[08:18.940 --> 08:21.180]  They will have different cannabinoid profiles.
[08:21.180 --> 08:23.820]  They will have different terpene profiles.
[08:23.820 --> 08:28.300]  Depending on the breeding selections and the filial generation, you could have vastly
[08:28.300 --> 08:31.060]  different cannabinoid profiles.
[08:31.060 --> 08:37.920]  Without lab testing, there is no way of knowing how much CBD or THC is in each finished plant.
[08:37.920 --> 08:42.420]  The only way you are going to know which of those plants works effectively for your son's
[08:42.420 --> 08:46.740]  condition is to make a tincture out of each one of them and let him try it.
[08:46.740 --> 08:50.960]  Then you have to observe him after trying each one and make sure that what you're giving
[08:50.960 --> 08:52.460]  him is working for him.
[08:52.620 --> 08:56.940]  Now you could, in theory, administer each plant as a separate dose or you could mix
[08:56.940 --> 09:01.260]  all of the finished product together and make one large batch of tincture that way and see
[09:01.260 --> 09:02.660]  how it all works.
[09:02.660 --> 09:03.860]  That is up to you.
[09:03.860 --> 09:06.580]  There are a couple of ups and downs to this.
[09:06.580 --> 09:12.000]  The downside is some of those phenotypes may contain THC.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.720]  If that medicine is working for your son, that is wonderful.
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.580]  But if anything should come up and your child is tested for THC and he is tested positive,
[09:21.580 --> 09:23.480]  maybe they want to put him on another medicine.
[09:23.480 --> 09:25.360]  Maybe something comes up in the family.
[09:25.360 --> 09:26.580]  Maybe he gets hurt somehow.
[09:26.580 --> 09:27.920]  Maybe something comes up.
[09:27.920 --> 09:30.020]  You said he shows signs of autism.
[09:30.020 --> 09:33.480]  Maybe they want to test him to put him on an autism medicine and they want to test to
[09:33.480 --> 09:36.900]  see if he's on THC just because anything could happen.
[09:36.900 --> 09:42.380]  If they test your child and he does test for THC, that could become a problem.
[09:42.380 --> 09:48.380]  The positive is you are now making custom tailored medicine for your son.
[09:48.380 --> 09:52.940]  If you find one phenotype out of a pack of seeds that makes the perfect medicine for
[09:52.940 --> 09:57.960]  your son, you have solved a problem and you've got him healthy and happy for a long term.
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.220]  You can produce that medicine.
[09:59.220 --> 10:00.740]  You can make the tincture out of it.
[10:00.740 --> 10:03.660]  You can administer that tincture at the proper dose.
[10:03.660 --> 10:07.200]  Whenever he needs it, you can keep him in a good condition.
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.020]  That is the advantage to doing a phenohunt from seed and finding the perfect phenotype
[10:12.020 --> 10:14.920]  for the medicinal application which you are seeking.
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.800]  Like I mentioned before, the risk there is getting the THC into the child and having
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.020]  something go wrong legally because there is THC in your child's bloodstream.
[10:25.020 --> 10:27.680]  Maybe one of those teachers that asked, are you giving him Adderall?
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.340]  You said, no, it's CBD.
[10:29.340 --> 10:32.620]  Maybe one of them is all uppity and they want to throw a fit one day.
[10:32.620 --> 10:33.840]  Maybe something happens.
[10:33.840 --> 10:35.360]  Maybe your child has an outburst.
[10:35.360 --> 10:37.200]  I'm not just saying your kid's a bad kid.
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.160]  I'm just giving you options, ideas of shit that could go wrong.
[10:40.160 --> 10:42.840]  Maybe somebody throws something at your kid and he throws something back and now they're
[10:42.840 --> 10:46.640]  going to blame it on your kid because you give him CBD and they're going to drug test
[10:46.640 --> 10:50.320]  your kid and he's got THC in there and now it's a whole new ballgame.
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.980]  Just try to look way ahead in the future and see options so we can prevent that kind of
[10:54.980 --> 10:56.280]  shit from happening.
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.600]  But that could be the only downfall to this.
[10:58.600 --> 11:02.800]  If you do a phenohunt, you find that perfectly custom tailored phenotype that works for your
[11:02.800 --> 11:04.780]  child, then it's got THC in it.
[11:04.780 --> 11:06.640]  If it works, I hope that is the case.
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.440]  I hope it works beautifully, but I don't want any trouble to come from it.
[11:09.440 --> 11:10.440]  So keep that in mind.
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.280]  Without a lab test, you don't know exactly what you are giving your kid.
[11:14.280 --> 11:15.520]  We know that it's cannabis.
[11:15.520 --> 11:16.520]  We know that you grew it.
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.600]  We know what it's in it, but we don't know the finished cannabinoid or terpene profile.
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.460]  So without a qualified lab, I don't know how you would determine how much THC or CBD is
[11:26.460 --> 11:33.220]  in your product, but I can make recommendations on seeds that are very well known to be very
[11:33.220 --> 11:37.760]  high in CBD and very low in THC.
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.440]  In Colorado, the strain I am about to recommend is grown in many hemp fields.
[11:42.440 --> 11:49.440]  In Colorado, finished products are allowed to have 0.3% THC, which is very little THC.
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.280]  If a product tests any higher than 0.3% THC, it is either considered cannabis or if it
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.800]  is supposed to be a hemp plant, it is then destroyed.
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.460]  If a hemp farmer produces too much hemp, the test will be called hot.
[12:04.460 --> 12:11.140]  If it tests higher than 0.3% THC, he can face legal ramifications in the state of Colorado
[12:11.140 --> 12:16.360]  just by growing a plant that accidentally tested too high for a certain cannabinoid.
[12:16.360 --> 12:20.500]  So people in Colorado are very picky about the plants that they are planting in their
[12:20.500 --> 12:21.920]  CBD fields.
[12:21.920 --> 12:29.280]  A very popular CBD varietal that has been going around Colorado is known as the cherry
[12:29.280 --> 12:30.280]  wine.
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.120]  If you do a Google search, you should be able to find the cherry wine seeds and you should
[12:34.140 --> 12:37.300]  be able to get your hands on them very easily.
[12:37.300 --> 12:41.720]  Cherry wine, it is a high CBD hemp variety.
[12:41.720 --> 12:45.220]  One thing I need to suggest if you choose to grow the cherry wine is make sure you cut
[12:45.220 --> 12:46.780]  it down a little bit early.
[12:46.780 --> 12:51.840]  If it goes too late, it will develop some THC and it will become hot.
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.980]  Most oftentimes, a little bit of THC will help with the effects of the CBD, but also
[12:57.980 --> 13:02.580]  we need to pay attention to how we are medicating your son and we may need to be careful for
[13:02.600 --> 13:05.080]  legal reasons like we mentioned earlier.
[13:05.080 --> 13:09.840]  So if you do let the cherry wine go too long and it develops THC, it may be helpful, but
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.320]  I would recommend cutting it down early the first few times and see how it works for you.
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.200]  Once you've found a phenotype that you really like, then start playing with that one.
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.520]  Grow multiple clones of the same phenotype in the same environment.
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.520]  Maybe grow four of them.
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.520]  I don't know how much space you'll have.
[13:23.520 --> 13:25.040]  I'm going to say grow four.
[13:25.040 --> 13:26.800]  Maybe cut one down a week early.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.640]  Maybe cut one down right on time.
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.040]  Cut one down a week late and then you've got another one that you can cut down whenever
[13:32.100 --> 13:35.060]  you feel like it just because we picked four for some stupid reason.
[13:35.060 --> 13:38.980]  So maybe do some experiments and find out what cannabinoid profile you get by letting
[13:38.980 --> 13:41.420]  them grow a little sooner, a little later.
[13:41.420 --> 13:42.740]  See what happens there.
[13:42.740 --> 13:45.740]  So that is the hemp variety that I would recommend.
[13:45.740 --> 13:47.500]  That is the cherry wine.
[13:47.500 --> 13:51.760]  Cherry wine has become really popular in Colorado and across the entire United States since
[13:51.760 --> 13:54.060]  the farm bill allowed us to grow more hemp.
[13:54.060 --> 13:55.500]  So the cherry wine is really popular.
[13:55.500 --> 13:57.900]  It has been bred to many things.
[13:57.900 --> 14:02.360]  One thing I can recommend, if you can't find cherry wine seeds by itself, I can recommend
[14:02.360 --> 14:05.880]  the cherry torino from llama bean seeds.
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.720]  You should find some very CBD dominant phenotypes in the cherry torino as well.
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.960]  All right, let's talk more about things that do have the potential to produce one to one
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.600]  ratio phenotypes.
[14:18.600 --> 14:23.880]  Again, when you're growing from seed, you're going to see phenotypical variation.
[14:23.880 --> 14:27.900]  You're going to have different cannabinoid profiles, different terpene profiles, possibly
[14:27.900 --> 14:30.560]  completely different growth shapes and structures.
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.340]  You're going to see differences.
[14:32.340 --> 14:35.740]  In my opinion, that is the fun and the beauty of growing from seed.
[14:35.740 --> 14:39.020]  I get to pick the phenotype that works perfectly for me.
[14:39.020 --> 14:42.580]  In this case, you get to pick the phenotype that works perfectly for your son.
[14:42.580 --> 14:46.380]  So let's talk about some one to one ratio strains.
[14:46.380 --> 14:51.580]  A strain that I see commonly testing with one to one ratios is something called Pennywise.
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.560]  Pennywise should put out some phenotypes that will give you a one to one CBD to THC ratio.
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.320]  Some, of course, will lean heavier to the CBD side and some will lean heavier to the
[15:03.320 --> 15:09.640]  THC, but you will find that one to one ratio phenotype in there if you run a few seeds.
[15:09.640 --> 15:12.220]  Another one I can suggest is the Harlequin.
[15:12.220 --> 15:15.400]  I'm not sure that Harlequin is available in seeds by itself.
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.300]  It should be available in feminized seeds somewhere by now.
[15:18.300 --> 15:21.220]  If not, it has been crossed to many other things.
[15:21.360 --> 15:29.080]  You will find many CBD heavy and one to one type phenotypes in many Harlequin crosses.
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.460]  Another strain I should mention that is known for making high CBD and potentially one to
[15:33.460 --> 15:37.700]  one ratio phenotypes is a plant known as ACDC.
[15:37.700 --> 15:43.220]  I've seen some breeding done to ACDC and everything that comes out seems to come out CBD rich.
[15:43.220 --> 15:48.840]  So if you can find seeds of ACDC or a cross of ACDC, you should find some potentially
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.800]  CBD rich and possibly one to one type phenotypes.
[15:52.800 --> 15:58.680]  Again, this is going to be phenotype dependent and you don't have a lab to test for THC and
[15:58.680 --> 16:04.600]  CBD, so you're going to have to find a phenotype that works for your son or yourself.
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.840]  Now if you really want a better opportunity to get a true one to one ratio, something
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.000]  you could do would be to grow something like the Cherry Wine or another CBD rich variety
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.120]  like the Wythe.
[16:15.120 --> 16:17.760]  You could grow some of that and then you could extract that.
[16:17.760 --> 16:21.160]  Then you could grow something that is high in THC like we're going to talk about in just
[16:21.160 --> 16:22.960]  a moment and you could extract that.
[16:22.960 --> 16:24.280]  You could make your tincture out of that.
[16:24.280 --> 16:29.120]  Then you've got a batch of high THC tincture for yourself and for your fiance and then
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.760]  you've got a vat of high CBD tincture for your son.
[16:32.760 --> 16:34.000]  Then you could mix them at will.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.640]  You could have a 50 50 ratio.
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.760]  You could have a one to three.
[16:36.760 --> 16:38.160]  You could have a 20 to one.
[16:38.160 --> 16:40.440]  You can make whatever kind of blend you wanted out of that.
[16:40.440 --> 16:45.000]  You could customize your cannabinoid ratios that would work best for you, for your son,
[16:45.000 --> 16:46.000]  for your fiance.
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.920]  However you wanted to do it for the morning, for the afternoon, you could make your perfect
[16:49.920 --> 16:52.160]  dose if you wanted to do something like that.
[16:52.160 --> 16:56.600]  Again, without lab testing, you're going to have to experiment on yourself and see which
[16:56.600 --> 17:01.160]  plant works best for you, see which ratios and which mixes work best for you.
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.080]  In my opinion, that is part of the fun of medicating with cannabis.
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.720]  Your condition is a little more serious than some people's, so it's a little more critical
[17:08.720 --> 17:12.640]  that we get it correct and also we're working with a small person here, so we really need
[17:12.640 --> 17:17.720]  to make sure to get the ratio dialed in so we don't create any discomfort that may scare
[17:17.720 --> 17:20.240]  the child away from using it as medicine again.
[17:20.240 --> 17:23.240]  We really want to work on getting it right, but just a little trial and error.
[17:23.240 --> 17:26.040]  It won't take too long to get everything dialed in.
[17:26.040 --> 17:28.760]  Let's talk about some THC rich strains.
[17:28.760 --> 17:32.000]  Also, you said strains that work well for PTSD.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.440]  I've got a traumatic brain injury that comes with a little bit of weird PTSD, so I have
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.440]  experience in that department.
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.640]  I have noticed through myself and talking with other people that there are a few strains
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.400]  that really do help with things like PTSD, so let's jump right into that.
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.720]  One of my favorites, and maybe just because I bred it and it is named after me, but one
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.120]  of my favorites that works for my brain injury and my PTSD is a little strain called Lemon
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.200]  Jeffrey.
[17:58.200 --> 18:04.000]  Lemon Jeffrey is a female lemon skunk pollinated by a reversed golden goat, so that is a feminized
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.480]  seed line.
[18:05.520 --> 18:11.640]  Lemon Jeffrey seems to work very well for anxiety and PTSD type of situations.
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.920]  I describe that my brain injury makes it feel like my record skips a little bit.
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.160]  My brain will be going just fine, but then sometimes it'll just ... and then it'll keep
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.000]  going right after that, but then as it comes back around to that part of the record, so
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.600]  it'll just skip a couple of times.
[18:26.600 --> 18:32.040]  Nobody else really notices it but me, but I feel like if I smoke enough Lemon Jeffrey
[18:32.160 --> 18:35.400]  or a couple of the other strains that we're going to talk about, that little skip on my
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.320]  record just gets wiped right off.
[18:37.320 --> 18:38.320]  It's like record cleaner.
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.600]  They just polish up my CD, cleans up my record, cleans my hard drive or whatever, puts all
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.400]  the files back in the correct drawer so that my brain can access them properly.
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.760]  I feel like strains that have limonene really work well for my brain, for my PTSD, for my
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.360]  traumatic brain injury, so Lemon Jeffrey works beautifully for the PTSD.
[18:58.360 --> 19:04.360]  Another strain I can recommend for anxiety and PTSD is Jilly Bean.
[19:04.360 --> 19:08.040]  There's something in the Jilly Bean that just puts a smile on your face.
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.080]  It makes the PTSD kind of chill out.
[19:10.080 --> 19:15.580]  Any sort of bad thoughts, bad vibes, bad moods, it all just kind of just ... it goes away.
[19:15.580 --> 19:19.560]  The bad vibes are washed away when you smoke the Lemon Jeffrey and the Jilly Bean.
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.480]  It just kind of ... it just makes you feel better.
[19:21.480 --> 19:22.800]  You're in a better mood.
[19:22.800 --> 19:24.920]  I don't know if it's the high from it.
[19:24.920 --> 19:26.240]  I don't know if it's the terps.
[19:26.240 --> 19:29.160]  I don't know if it's the specific cannabinoids in either one of those.
[19:29.160 --> 19:32.320]  I think the limonene and the Lemon Jeffrey really has something to do with it, just from
[19:32.320 --> 19:35.080]  as much attention as I've paid to that limonene terp.
[19:35.080 --> 19:40.160]  I noticed that one helps my brain a lot, but the Jilly Bean kind of does the same thing.
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.160]  It's not as potent.
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.960]  It doesn't last as long, but it'll get me there.
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.680]  Another strain that works really well for the PTSD and anxiety type of stuff is a strain
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.440]  called Clementine.
[19:50.440 --> 19:53.440]  Clementine smells a lot like Jilly Bean.
[19:53.440 --> 19:58.320]  Clementine is very similar to the Lemon Jeffrey.
[19:58.320 --> 20:01.560]  Clementine has Lemon Skunk in it.
[20:01.560 --> 20:04.040]  Lemon Jeffrey also has Lemon Skunk in it.
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.680]  That makes me think there's something about that Lemon Skunk terp or that Lemon Skunk
[20:07.680 --> 20:14.040]  strain that is doing something good for the PTSD, for the anxiety type of conditions.
[20:14.040 --> 20:17.360]  Now I just thought of one more that I should mention that fits right into this category.
[20:17.360 --> 20:20.480]  When I say the name of the strain, you're going to go, oh yeah, that makes sense, but
[20:20.480 --> 20:26.280]  One that really works well for PTSD and anxiety and social anxiety sort of stuff is a little
[20:26.280 --> 20:27.560]  strain called Tangy.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.040]  A few people have heard of Tangy.
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.400]  It's getting kind of popular.
[20:30.400 --> 20:34.900]  You probably have heard of that one a couple times, but that orange citrusy terp seems
[20:34.900 --> 20:40.720]  to really do something really nice for the traumatic brain injury, PTSD type of stuff.
[20:40.720 --> 20:44.520]  Now those strains will be high in THC, but they're not going to be the highest.
[20:44.520 --> 20:48.200]  They will be in the high 20s if grown properly, the mid to high 20s.
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.460]  Some of them may hit 30.
[20:49.460 --> 20:53.460]  Lemon Jeffrey has hit 30 before, but not all of them are going to be super high in
[20:53.460 --> 20:55.780]  THC, but it's more about the effect.
[20:55.780 --> 20:58.420]  I think you need those terps to get what you need.
[20:58.420 --> 21:03.660]  I think the THC, if it were fireworks, the THC tells you how high the firework is going
[21:03.660 --> 21:04.660]  to climb.
[21:04.660 --> 21:08.460]  Then the terps are kind of what colors the firework is going to put off.
[21:08.460 --> 21:10.580]  So the terps decide the display.
[21:10.580 --> 21:13.240]  The THC decides how high it's going to go.
[21:13.240 --> 21:15.940]  So I think the terpenes are going to have a lot to do with it.
[21:15.940 --> 21:18.820]  Don't focus too much on that THC number.
[21:18.820 --> 21:23.780]  THC is definitely important, but the terps are what we need if we're aiming for a specific
[21:23.780 --> 21:26.700]  condition and you asked for something for the PTSD.
[21:26.700 --> 21:28.460]  So I think that's going to help you out.
[21:28.460 --> 21:32.620]  Now again, without lab testing, we don't know exactly what type of ratios you're getting.
[21:32.620 --> 21:35.500]  I know that the cherry wine will be rich in CBD.
[21:35.500 --> 21:40.140]  I know that the few I mentioned will have the opportunity and the potential to produce
[21:40.140 --> 21:46.540]  high CBD phenotypes and also one-to-one ratios, also other types of specific ratios.
[21:46.540 --> 21:50.140]  I'm not sure what you're going to get, but they do have the potential.
[21:50.140 --> 21:53.100]  Without a lab test, you'll find something in there that works for you.
[21:53.100 --> 21:55.180]  It's sort of a placebo effect.
[21:55.180 --> 21:58.600]  If I gave you a bunch of lab numbers, you would believe that that one with that good
[21:58.600 --> 21:59.600]  number works.
[21:59.600 --> 22:02.860]  Without those numbers, the one that works will work for you.
[22:02.860 --> 22:07.880]  Just rely on your body, rely on what you observe in your sun, and you will know exactly which
[22:07.880 --> 22:09.260]  plant to keep using.
[22:09.260 --> 22:13.940]  All right, so those are a bunch of different options for strains that you asked information
[22:13.940 --> 22:14.940]  on.
[22:14.940 --> 22:17.620]  CBD, something one-to-one, something THC.
[22:17.620 --> 22:21.420]  With all of that information, I hope you have made a decision on if you want to grow or
[22:21.420 --> 22:23.940]  if you want to stick to getting those tinctures.
[22:23.940 --> 22:27.340]  You're going to have to grow a good amount to produce enough tincture to keep the entire
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.980]  family medicated.
[22:28.980 --> 22:34.580]  I think I'm the only podcast online right now without a CBD tincture sponsorship or
[22:34.580 --> 22:40.420]  some sort of CBD tincture advertising, but there are many options available for quality
[22:40.420 --> 22:42.220]  CBD tinctures.
[22:42.220 --> 22:44.580]  Make sure you go with a reputable company.
[22:44.580 --> 22:48.660]  If the place you are shopping has become too expensive, shop around, look for more
[22:48.660 --> 22:49.660]  options.
[22:49.660 --> 22:51.820]  Like I said, don't be fooled by gimmicky shit.
[22:51.820 --> 22:53.260]  Don't fall for snake oil.
[22:53.260 --> 22:55.420]  Read a lot of reviews, shop around.
[22:55.420 --> 22:59.580]  If you're going to buy a product, type in the name of that product and then type in
[22:59.580 --> 23:02.460]  customer reviews and go read a lot of reviews.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.660]  See what people think.
[23:03.660 --> 23:05.340]  Fish out the bullshit reviews.
[23:05.340 --> 23:06.700]  Some of those reviews are going to be fake.
[23:06.700 --> 23:08.300]  They were left by the company.
[23:08.300 --> 23:12.180]  Learn how to find that shit and then read the reviews and see what you think about the
[23:12.180 --> 23:13.180]  products.
[23:13.180 --> 23:14.380]  You don't have to get it from that one source.
[23:14.380 --> 23:17.140]  There are many options available, but I hope you're able to grow.
[23:17.140 --> 23:20.900]  I want everybody to be able to grow and produce a quality product, but it is going to be a
[23:20.900 --> 23:21.900]  lot of work.
[23:21.900 --> 23:23.980]  I just want you to know there are options available.
[23:23.980 --> 23:28.380]  All right, my friend out there in prohibition land, I want to thank you for this great email.
[23:28.380 --> 23:29.380]  I wish you luck.
[23:29.380 --> 23:30.860]  I hope everything goes well for you.
[23:30.860 --> 23:33.020]  Either way you decide to approach this problem.
[23:33.020 --> 23:35.940]  I wish you, your family and your son the best of luck.
[23:35.940 --> 23:39.420]  If I can do anything else to help you, please send me another email.
[23:39.420 --> 23:41.420]  You have got my email address.
[23:41.420 --> 23:46.020]  If anybody else out there would like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheart
[23:46.020 --> 23:49.300]  at hotmail.com and you know that I would love to hear from you.
[23:49.300 --> 23:52.500]  All right, podcast world, that email got away from me.
[23:52.500 --> 23:57.220]  It took longer than anticipated, so I'm going to save my next message for the next episode.
[23:57.220 --> 24:01.600]  I want to thank you for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[24:59.900 --> 25:01.740]  yo, what's wrong with my plant?
[25:01.740 --> 25:05.300]  People like myself and other experienced growers and breeders may chime in and say, hey, it's
[25:05.300 --> 25:08.660]  a cow mag issue, or maybe you should do something different.
[25:08.660 --> 25:10.580]  I don't know what could be wrong with your plant, but we'll tell you.
[25:11.060 --> 25:12.060]  We'll say, hey, this is what's wrong.
