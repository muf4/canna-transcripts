[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.080]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 637 of the Grow From Your
[00:13.080 --> 00:14.080]  Heart podcast.
[00:14.080 --> 00:17.560]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.
[00:17.560 --> 00:20.520]  Before we get to that part, you know I like to do shout outs to our friends who support
[00:20.520 --> 00:21.940]  us on Patreon.
[00:21.940 --> 00:25.560]  So let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[00:25.560 --> 00:27.360]  my friend Lefty's Farm.
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.240]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Captain Mojo.
[00:29.480 --> 00:32.920]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to North North Terps and a big thank you shout
[00:32.920 --> 00:34.680]  out to Miss North Terps.

[01:03.600 --> 01:06.520]  I want to send a big fist bump to Zaxxon Scouten.
[01:06.520 --> 01:11.000]  And then let's wrap up these shout outs with a big thank you shout out to my friend Papa
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.120]  Roney.
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.060]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.640]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:27.040 --> 01:30.260]  Of course, all of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:30.260 --> 01:32.920]  There is a link in the show notes and the video description.
[01:32.920 --> 01:36.320]  So if you've got your hands full, maybe you're driving or whatever you're doing, follow that
[01:36.320 --> 01:42.960]  link that will get you right to the Patreon page at patreon.com forward slash grow from
[01:42.960 --> 01:44.120]  your heart.
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.800]  Speaking of Patreon, I'm going to jump right into this first message.
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.120]  It says, Hey, I got this subscription for my boyfriend as a gift.
[01:51.120 --> 01:53.120]  He goes by Zee-suffer.
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.400]  So in previous episodes, I've talked about making sure to do the appropriate shout out
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.000]  for the appropriate name.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.760]  This person signed up for Patreon.
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.720]  I think I gave the girlfriend or the other half of the relationship a shout out.
[02:04.720 --> 02:08.200]  They sent me a message and said, Hey, please shout out Zee-suffer because I bought this
[02:08.200 --> 02:10.360]  subscription for my boyfriend as a gift.
[02:10.360 --> 02:11.720]  So shout out to Zee-suffer.
[02:11.720 --> 02:14.880]  You got a great partner there getting you a Patreon subscription.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.480]  Also thank you Zee-suffer because I got a great gift out of that as well.
[02:18.480 --> 02:19.480]  Good work.
[02:19.480 --> 02:20.880]  Thank you both for the support.
[02:20.880 --> 02:21.880]  All right.
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.400]  Once again, you guys, if I'm doing shout outs and I'm not saying the appropriate name, please
[02:25.400 --> 02:30.000]  politely, kindly, gently send me a message and say, Hey, you're calling me Zee-suffer
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.920]  or not calling me Zee-suffer and that's what I need to be called.
[02:32.920 --> 02:33.920]  Let me know.
[02:33.920 --> 02:34.920]  I'll get it straightened out.
[02:34.920 --> 02:37.560]  Also, I am doing my best to catch up on Patreon messages.
[02:37.560 --> 02:39.080]  I realize I am behind.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.080]  I'm a one man army.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.880]  Uh, no, I'm not a one man army.
[02:41.880 --> 02:42.880]  I'm a one person.
[02:42.880 --> 02:44.080]  You guys are a huge army.
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.520]  I'm a one man show with a big army.
[02:46.520 --> 02:49.480]  Uh, I can't respond to everybody right away, but I'm doing my best.
[02:49.480 --> 02:50.960]  I promise I'm catching up.
[02:50.960 --> 02:55.040]  Uh, the thing about emails, I've said this before, you reply to them and you get more
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.040]  back.
[02:56.040 --> 02:57.040]  People reply again.
[02:57.040 --> 02:58.320]  Uh, thank you guys for all the support.
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.320]  It means a lot to me.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.920]  Uh, shout out to Zee-suffer and the gang.
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.360]  Now I do want to move into some of the chatter part of the show here.
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  That's what I labeled this.
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.680]  It is called chatter.
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.160]  Uh, this portion of the show will be brought to you by my friend EZO57.
[03:10.160 --> 03:12.640]  Shout out to EZO57 for the continued support.
[03:12.640 --> 03:14.880]  We do not have corporate sponsors here on this show.
[03:14.880 --> 03:18.560]  Uh, we've got friends and family that support us and I will give them shout outs when I
[03:18.560 --> 03:19.560]  feel it's appropriate.
[03:19.560 --> 03:23.200]  It feels way better than talking about a shit ass product I probably wouldn't use and try
[03:23.200 --> 03:25.040]  to pawn off on you guys for money.
[03:25.040 --> 03:26.040]  Not going to do that.
[03:26.040 --> 03:27.460]  We're going to shout out our friends that need love.
[03:27.460 --> 03:29.520]  Big up, big up to EZO57.
[03:29.520 --> 03:35.400]  Now the first chatter in today's episode is, uh, a very common thing I see on social media.
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.960]  I need to stay off social media, honestly, cause it's going to give me a fucking aneurysm.
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.760]  But uh, something I want to talk about when we talk about day one of flower day one of
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.220]  flower is day one.
[03:45.220 --> 03:49.660]  When you turn that, that timer to 1212 that's day one of flower.
[03:49.660 --> 03:50.980]  That is when you started flowering.
[03:50.980 --> 03:54.360]  So I saw somebody say that the first two weeks don't count.
[03:54.360 --> 03:55.760]  The first week doesn't count.
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.040]  You don't start counting until you see hairs or something.
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.120]  Nah, bro.
[04:00.120 --> 04:02.040]  You're the farmer, you're the grower.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.680]  It is your control.
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.740]  Day one is when you flipped that timer.
[04:06.740 --> 04:07.740]  That is when you did it.
[04:07.740 --> 04:09.940]  That is always going to be day one.
[04:09.940 --> 04:12.540]  And people are going to say, why do you get to decide that that's day one?
[04:12.540 --> 04:14.340]  Because I make the seed packages, bro.
[04:14.340 --> 04:18.740]  I printed the labels on the seed pack and I decided that on my seeds, that's day one
[04:18.740 --> 04:22.100]  and all my other breeder friends, we talked about it and we had a little meeting and a
[04:22.100 --> 04:26.140]  powwow and a group and we all realized and decided that we needed to say day one is the
[04:26.140 --> 04:28.820]  day we turn the lights to 1212.
[04:28.820 --> 04:32.380]  A lot of you, some of you, many of you, a few of you, I don't know the ratio.
[04:32.380 --> 04:35.820]  Some of the fuckers out there are going to be turning the lights off completely for 48,
[04:35.820 --> 04:39.020]  24 hours, then going into flower.
[04:39.020 --> 04:43.540]  I think day one is when you put that 1212 on the first time and when it comes on 12
[04:43.540 --> 04:46.260]  hours on 12 hours off, that is now day one.
[04:46.260 --> 04:50.100]  People are going to say, what about day zero and all kinds of weird shit that just quit
[04:50.100 --> 04:51.100]  overthinking it.
[04:51.100 --> 04:54.100]  Day one is the first time you put the plants on a 12 hour day.
[04:54.100 --> 04:55.820]  That's day one.
[04:55.820 --> 04:58.780]  A lot of people also talk about doing weird transitions.
[04:58.780 --> 05:03.340]  I just mentioned 12, 24 hours off, 48 hours off.
[05:03.340 --> 05:04.940]  There's not really a downside to that.
[05:05.060 --> 05:06.060]  It's free.
[05:06.060 --> 05:07.060]  It doesn't cost you anything.
[05:07.060 --> 05:09.340]  You're not getting any light energy and the plants will transition more quickly, but it's
[05:09.340 --> 05:12.140]  also not completely necessary.
[05:12.140 --> 05:15.740]  Also I don't agree with like a tapering down light cycles.
[05:15.740 --> 05:17.140]  They say, but that happens outdoors.
[05:17.140 --> 05:19.460]  Yeah, we're not growing outdoors at all.
[05:19.460 --> 05:25.260]  You don't want, I, in my opinion, I do not want to just slowly decrease the amount of
[05:25.260 --> 05:27.180]  time that the lights are on in my room.
[05:27.180 --> 05:34.540]  They go from either 20 on and four off or 18 on and six off straight to 1212 boom, straight
[05:34.660 --> 05:35.660]  into flower.
[05:35.660 --> 05:36.660]  Matt is day one.
[05:36.660 --> 05:40.860]  The day I changed that timer, maybe it's tomorrow that they're going to wake up and do 12 on
[05:40.860 --> 05:41.980]  and 12 off.
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.220]  That is when I will count day one.
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.660]  It's generally a Monday for me.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.740]  I like to flip on Monday.
[05:45.740 --> 05:47.780]  It's just easier to keep track of shit.
[05:47.780 --> 05:51.460]  Flip on Monday, feed on Monday, do all the big work on Monday, catch up on the rest of
[05:51.460 --> 05:53.100]  the stuff throughout the week.
[05:53.100 --> 05:54.100]  All right.
[05:54.100 --> 05:56.620]  So day one is the day that you flip those plants into flower.
[05:56.620 --> 05:58.620]  Don't let anybody tell you any differently.
[05:58.620 --> 05:59.900]  We're going to set a standard here.
[05:59.900 --> 06:01.460]  We're all going to agree.
[06:01.460 --> 06:07.780]  Day one is the day they want to flower is the day you flip that timer to 1212.
[06:07.780 --> 06:09.420]  We'll touch on veg.
[06:09.420 --> 06:10.740]  You can do veg however you want.
[06:10.740 --> 06:15.820]  I do seedling or clone stage and then I do small veg and then I do large veg.
[06:15.820 --> 06:19.020]  You can break up the veg cycle however you want that works best for you.
[06:19.020 --> 06:22.820]  That is your your factory, your grow, your farm.
[06:22.820 --> 06:24.540]  You get to decide how you want on that.
[06:24.540 --> 06:27.100]  So you can label that however you want.
[06:27.100 --> 06:28.100]  My clones are clones.
[06:28.100 --> 06:29.100]  You know what I'm saying?
[06:29.100 --> 06:30.100]  They're clones.
[06:30.100 --> 06:31.100]  I'm not a clone.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.100]  I'm the cloner.
[06:32.100 --> 06:33.100]  They are small veg.
[06:33.100 --> 06:35.220]  They're in either a four inch square pot or a six inch net pot.
[06:35.220 --> 06:36.600]  Sometimes they're in a beer cup.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.020]  That is my small veg.
[06:38.020 --> 06:42.140]  Once it goes into a one gallon pot, that could be medium veg depending on what I'm doing.
[06:42.140 --> 06:45.540]  Then it'll go into three gallon or a five gallon, maybe a seven.
[06:45.540 --> 06:47.380]  Now I'm in full veg.
[06:47.380 --> 06:53.280]  So you get to decide when you enter that veg stage, small, large veg.
[06:53.280 --> 06:54.280]  That is kind of up to you.
[06:54.280 --> 06:55.880]  It doesn't matter because it's your garden.
[06:55.880 --> 06:58.600]  It's just an arbitrary label that you're giving it.
[06:58.600 --> 06:59.780]  We're not checking on you.
[07:00.460 --> 07:01.460]  The one that really matters is flower.
[07:01.460 --> 07:02.980]  Day one of flower is when you flip.
[07:02.980 --> 07:05.400]  All right, I want to move down the list here.
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.620]  Another thing when I'm on the internet and social media, another thing that makes me
[07:08.620 --> 07:16.220]  want to have a small aneurysm is people saying that they can tell the sex of a seed by the
[07:16.220 --> 07:20.300]  shape of that seed.
[07:20.300 --> 07:21.300]  That's bullshit.
[07:21.300 --> 07:22.300]  Quit believing that.
[07:22.300 --> 07:23.300]  Quit perpetuating that.
[07:23.300 --> 07:24.820]  Quit spreading that.
[07:24.820 --> 07:26.220]  Just stop it.
[07:26.220 --> 07:27.780]  Stop it.
[07:27.780 --> 07:28.940]  Just fucking stop.
[07:29.260 --> 07:34.260]  You can't tell the sex of a seed by the shape of the seed.
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.260]  You can't do that.
[07:35.260 --> 07:36.260]  I make feminized seeds.
[07:36.260 --> 07:37.420]  I make regular seeds.
[07:37.420 --> 07:39.020]  I can roll them on the table together.
[07:39.020 --> 07:41.900]  You can tell no difference between the regular and femme seeds.
[07:41.900 --> 07:45.120]  You can hold them one of each side by side with a magnifying glass.
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.220]  You're not going to see any difference.
[07:46.220 --> 07:47.820]  You've got to grow them.
[07:47.820 --> 07:51.140]  Maybe you could do some science and cut them open and do some DNA checking and you could
[07:51.140 --> 07:54.180]  tell which seed is male and female maybe at that point.
[07:54.180 --> 07:58.340]  I don't even know if you can do it then, but you definitely cannot tell by looking.
[07:58.740 --> 08:03.180]  People say that if it's got like a volcano on the one end or a dimple on one end or fucking
[08:03.180 --> 08:04.180]  no, dude, stop.
[08:04.180 --> 08:05.180]  No, you've got to grow them.
[08:05.180 --> 08:06.180]  You've got to grow them out.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.420]  So quit with that shit.
[08:07.420 --> 08:08.900]  That is not real.
[08:08.900 --> 08:12.100]  Anybody that says that immediately discredits themselves for anything else they're going
[08:12.100 --> 08:14.060]  to tell me about cannabis in the future.
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.260]  All right.
[08:15.260 --> 08:19.340]  So what I wanted to get to my next note is the internet is full of backseat drivers and
[08:19.340 --> 08:20.860]  armchair quarterbacks.
[08:20.860 --> 08:25.180]  Take all of that internet advice, you guys, with a huge grain of salt.
[08:25.220 --> 08:26.540]  I'm going to be quite honest with you.
[08:26.540 --> 08:30.860]  Even my advice, I don't know your grow.
[08:30.860 --> 08:39.340]  The advice I give works in, I grow in either soilless mix or cocoa, cocoa pots, indoors
[08:39.340 --> 08:41.900]  under LEDs or Gavita lights.
[08:41.900 --> 08:45.540]  The advice I give my knowledge works for what I am doing.
[08:45.540 --> 08:49.540]  I try to keep it general so it works across the board.
[08:49.540 --> 08:54.300]  But sometimes what I'm doing is kind of specific and I try to be specific about that and let
[08:54.300 --> 08:58.100]  people know if you took some of my ideas and you took the ideas that I give you for
[08:58.100 --> 09:00.740]  an indoor grow and you did that in a greenhouse, it may not work.
[09:00.740 --> 09:04.780]  If you did my soil ideas in a hydro setup, it just may not work.
[09:04.780 --> 09:08.900]  So when you see people on the internet saying you've got to do this, maybe they're growing
[09:08.900 --> 09:13.020]  in a completely different environment, completely different method, completely different plan
[09:13.020 --> 09:14.020]  than you.
[09:14.020 --> 09:17.700]  So don't be afraid to do things your way.
[09:17.700 --> 09:19.180]  There's no wrong way to grow cannabis.
[09:19.180 --> 09:21.760]  The wrong way is when the plants die or you get raided.
[09:21.760 --> 09:22.900]  That is the wrong way.
[09:22.900 --> 09:26.460]  You get mildew, you get bugs, you learn from that, you recover, you move on.
[09:26.460 --> 09:28.180]  There's no real wrong way.
[09:28.180 --> 09:31.360]  If you get a harvest that you're happy with, you did it right.
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.180]  So don't let people on the internet tell you you're doing it wrong, especially people that
[09:35.180 --> 09:36.860]  aren't experienced or even me.
[09:36.860 --> 09:40.620]  If you want to do it your way, you could tell me to go fuck myself and do it your way and
[09:40.620 --> 09:42.060]  have fun.
[09:42.060 --> 09:46.540]  That's one of the most important parts is have fun in the grow.
[09:46.540 --> 09:48.660]  A lot of us have made, I've been guilty of this.
[09:48.660 --> 09:53.260]  I worked in commercial cultivation for so long that I let growing become stressful.
[09:53.260 --> 09:55.860]  There were deadlines, there were goals, there were numbers.
[09:55.860 --> 10:00.140]  I was forgetting about the most important part about when somebody smokes this herb,
[10:00.140 --> 10:01.740]  they're going to feel better.
[10:01.740 --> 10:04.220]  That's the most important part and I was forgetting about that.
[10:04.220 --> 10:05.460]  So have fun in there.
[10:05.460 --> 10:07.880]  But while you're having fun in there, learn.
[10:07.880 --> 10:12.300]  Don't forget to experiment, learn something, broaden your horizons.
[10:12.300 --> 10:15.180]  Just repeating the same cycle over and over and over.
[10:15.180 --> 10:16.780]  That's cool until you get good at it.
[10:16.900 --> 10:19.660]  But once you got your fucking training wheels are there, take off those training wheels
[10:19.660 --> 10:20.940]  and let's do some tricks, bro.
[10:20.940 --> 10:23.320]  Let's do some wheelies and shit.
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.420]  So get in there and have fun.
[10:24.420 --> 10:25.500]  Don't let people slow you down.
[10:25.500 --> 10:27.140]  Don't let people sway you.
[10:27.140 --> 10:31.660]  Experiment, learn, take a bunch of notes so that when you do something positive or negative
[10:31.660 --> 10:33.340]  to the plants, you've got notes.
[10:33.340 --> 10:35.740]  I talk about that all the time.
[10:35.740 --> 10:37.820]  Grow as a grower.
[10:37.820 --> 10:40.820]  Those plants are going to teach you things about yourself.
[10:40.820 --> 10:42.860]  The business will teach you things about yourself.
[10:42.860 --> 10:46.540]  You'll learn how to absorb knowledge, how you do learn and do not learn.
[10:46.540 --> 10:49.620]  Then you'll go back and you'll grow the plants and the plants will teach you more things.
[10:49.620 --> 10:52.300]  And then when you smoke them, you learn even more things.
[10:52.300 --> 10:53.540]  These plants are incredible to us.
[10:53.540 --> 10:56.860]  They can be greatly therapeutic if you take care of them.
[10:56.860 --> 11:03.300]  So the internet does not always know your goals, your obstacles, your situation, your
[11:03.300 --> 11:04.300]  setup.
[11:04.300 --> 11:08.820]  When you go looking for advice on the internet, be very leery and be very careful.
[11:08.820 --> 11:10.460]  Look to trusted books.
[11:10.460 --> 11:12.980]  There are plenty of books on the internet for free.
[11:12.980 --> 11:16.500]  You don't have to go to Facebook and go to a group and be like, what is this?
[11:16.500 --> 11:20.520]  There's a book out there that has that answer that was written by a professional cannabis
[11:20.520 --> 11:25.460]  grower and an author that knows what they're talking about.
[11:25.460 --> 11:28.540]  You're going to see a lot of wacky ass answers on social media.
[11:28.540 --> 11:30.500]  Be very careful.
[11:30.500 --> 11:31.500]  Advice is situational.
[11:31.500 --> 11:36.380]  I see a lot of times people say something like, you need to do this.
[11:36.380 --> 11:40.100]  And I'll just comment with, why does this grower need to do that?
[11:40.100 --> 11:41.820]  And they'll say, I do it.
[11:41.820 --> 11:46.540]  And I'll say, I eat fucking vegan food and drink kombucha.
[11:46.540 --> 11:48.500]  Does that mean that all growers need to do that?
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.500]  Like I'm good at growing.
[11:49.500 --> 11:53.040]  Does that mean that since I drink kombucha and eat fucking vegan, that everybody else
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.140]  out there has to do it to be good at growing?
[11:55.140 --> 11:56.920]  No, it does not.
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.660]  If I said I eat vegan and drink kombucha and it makes me a better grower because of this,
[12:01.660 --> 12:05.900]  then maybe I've got some ground to stand on.
[12:05.900 --> 12:09.300]  But if you're just saying because I do it, that's fucking monkey see, monkey do.
[12:09.500 --> 12:12.140]  And there's no real scientific fucking support behind that.
[12:12.140 --> 12:15.780]  My favorite is when somebody is like, well, my cousin did it one time and it worked.
[12:15.780 --> 12:17.620]  Like man, was your cousin growing hydro?
[12:17.620 --> 12:20.100]  Was your cousin growing fucking soil?
[12:20.100 --> 12:21.620]  Was your cousin growing indoors or outdoors?
[12:21.620 --> 12:22.620]  We don't know.
[12:22.620 --> 12:23.620]  We got one idea.
[12:23.620 --> 12:27.460]  Your cousin said poor fucking biscuits and gravy on it on Sunday and it would go kapow.
[12:27.460 --> 12:28.460]  Right.
[12:28.460 --> 12:30.780]  But man, we don't know what kind of biscuits, we don't know what kind of gravy.
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.020]  And so we got people fucking up their gardens, putting biscuits and gravy out there on Sunday
[12:35.020 --> 12:38.500]  and it's just messing shit up because one guy's uncle did it one time and it worked.
[12:38.700 --> 12:40.940]  So advice is very situational.
[12:40.940 --> 12:45.660]  What works for your buddy's biscuits and gravy grow may not work for my soil grow, may not
[12:45.660 --> 12:49.460]  work for your hydro grow, may not work for somebody's vertical grow.
[12:49.460 --> 12:51.140]  So pay very close attention.
[12:51.140 --> 12:53.380]  Then learn the plants.
[12:53.380 --> 12:54.460]  You've got to learn the plants.
[12:54.460 --> 12:55.820]  That's the only way to do this.
[12:55.820 --> 12:56.820]  Pay attention to the plants.
[12:56.820 --> 12:57.820]  You've got to experiment.
[12:57.820 --> 13:00.380]  You've got to get in there and fuck up.
[13:00.380 --> 13:01.380]  I've fucked up recently.
[13:01.380 --> 13:02.380]  I've talked about it.
[13:02.380 --> 13:05.020]  I had to kill a few plants because I just wasn't happy with the way they were going.
[13:05.020 --> 13:06.220]  But I did an experiment.
[13:06.220 --> 13:07.220]  I learned.
[13:07.220 --> 13:09.140]  I learned what not to do next time.
[13:09.140 --> 13:10.620]  Trust me, I know what not to do.
[13:10.620 --> 13:11.980]  That is what I learned the most.
[13:11.980 --> 13:14.660]  What not to do next time.
[13:14.660 --> 13:16.340]  I've done a full episode about mistakes.
[13:16.340 --> 13:18.660]  I'm kind of off on a ramble here, but I enjoy it.
[13:18.660 --> 13:20.500]  I've done a full episode about my mistakes.
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.760]  I don't post my failures to social media.
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.500]  You only see my victories, but the failures are what have made me a better grower.
[13:27.500 --> 13:30.220]  I don't learn anything if I'm successful every time.
[13:30.220 --> 13:34.220]  If I don't get a bug, if I don't get a nutrient deficiency, if I don't run into an equipment
[13:34.220 --> 13:36.300]  failure, what do I learn?
[13:36.380 --> 13:39.180]  My ego gets ahead of me and I start thinking I can do anything in the garden.
[13:39.180 --> 13:43.380]  I start dancing in there and popping bottles of kombucha and throwing quinoa flakes in
[13:43.380 --> 13:44.580]  the air like it's a fucking party.
[13:44.580 --> 13:45.660]  That's just a hippie joke, guys.
[13:45.660 --> 13:47.220]  Don't take me too seriously.
[13:47.220 --> 13:50.820]  But then I do shit like I go ahead and replace fucking lights in the middle of winter and
[13:50.820 --> 13:52.620]  then three days later it's a negative 17.
[13:52.620 --> 13:56.580]  I don't have HPS lights in this grow room to keep the grow warm anymore and all my plants
[13:56.580 --> 13:57.860]  look like shit and nearly die.
[13:57.860 --> 13:58.860]  What?
[13:58.860 --> 14:01.260]  I make mistakes like that because I just wasn't thinking.
[14:01.260 --> 14:02.580]  I've been winning too much.
[14:02.580 --> 14:04.140]  I hadn't taken an L in a long time.
[14:04.180 --> 14:05.180]  Guess what?
[14:05.180 --> 14:06.580]  I fucking lost that time.
[14:06.580 --> 14:11.140]  Learned my big lesson from that L. Anyway, you guys, don't be afraid to fail a couple
[14:11.140 --> 14:13.700]  times but also set yourself up for success.
[14:13.700 --> 14:15.660]  Don't let the internet ruin your grow.
[14:15.660 --> 14:18.220]  If I say you should do something, research it.
[14:18.220 --> 14:19.220]  Think about it.
[14:19.220 --> 14:20.740]  I'm not the only grower that knows what I'm talking about.
[14:20.740 --> 14:21.740]  There are a lot of other people.
[14:21.740 --> 14:24.460]  You can cross-reference what I said with them.
[14:24.460 --> 14:26.580]  Guru has different approaches to how I grow.
[14:26.580 --> 14:30.180]  Scotty has different approaches or different approaches than how I grow.
[14:30.180 --> 14:32.420]  Scotty grows differently than I grow.
[14:32.460 --> 14:34.420]  Who else out there has a ... Aquaponic Steve.
[14:34.420 --> 14:39.020]  Potent Ponic Steve grows completely differently than I grow but we're both having great success.
[14:39.020 --> 14:40.780]  We've both got podcasts that can teach you.
[14:40.780 --> 14:43.580]  Don't be afraid to cross-reference our knowledge, you guys.
[14:43.580 --> 14:46.860]  Don't be scared to double-check me, especially if you're growing a little bit differently
[14:46.860 --> 14:49.420]  than what I'm used to and what I'm teaching.
[14:49.420 --> 14:53.700]  Straight up, I do soilless mix or cocoa in about a three-gallon pot.
[14:53.700 --> 14:55.500]  If it's a commercial grow, I'm using Davidas.
[14:55.500 --> 14:57.820]  If it's a personal grow, I'm using LEDs.
[14:57.820 --> 15:01.820]  If you're doing something differently, my advice is going to be a little bit different.
[15:02.420 --> 15:03.020]  All right.
[15:03.020 --> 15:04.420]  I think I made my point there.
[15:04.420 --> 15:06.260]  Don't let the internet sway you, you guys.
[15:06.260 --> 15:07.180]  Have a goal.
[15:07.180 --> 15:08.100]  Have a plan.
[15:08.100 --> 15:09.140]  Fucking do it.
[15:09.140 --> 15:10.620]  I see a lot of people say,
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.900]  can I do this?
[15:11.900 --> 15:15.260]  And I just answer yes a lot of the times because yes.
[15:15.260 --> 15:18.620]  And then I see people just trying to fucking crush their dreams.
[15:18.620 --> 15:20.980]  Don't let the dream crushers crush your dreams, dude.
[15:20.980 --> 15:21.580]  You can do it.
[15:21.580 --> 15:23.380]  Yes, you can.
[15:23.380 --> 15:24.820]  Can I do this?
[15:24.820 --> 15:26.740]  Most likely with cannabis, yes, you can.
[15:26.740 --> 15:28.780]  If you can't, I'm going to tell you, no, that'll kill your plans.
[15:28.780 --> 15:29.380]  Or no, you can't do it.
[15:29.380 --> 15:31.020]  I'll give you a reason why, though.
[15:31.060 --> 15:33.140]  I'm not just going to shit all over your hopes and dreams and say,
[15:33.140 --> 15:36.020]  no, you can't do that and you're retarded and fucking don't forget your helmet.
[15:36.020 --> 15:38.020]  No, I'm going to tell you why you can't do that.
[15:38.020 --> 15:38.700]  Help you learn.
[15:38.700 --> 15:40.660]  Help you set yourself up for success.
[15:40.660 --> 15:41.900]  Help you have a good grow.
[15:41.900 --> 15:45.100]  And let you know why the idea was simply not going to work before you spend time,
[15:45.100 --> 15:48.620]  energy, money, effort, and a broken heart on this crazy experiment
[15:48.620 --> 15:50.620]  that somebody's probably already done.
[15:50.620 --> 15:50.860]  All right.
[15:50.860 --> 15:52.660]  I'm way into this episode.
[15:52.660 --> 15:53.740]  Where are we?
[15:53.740 --> 15:56.220]  I got to see when I started.
[15:56.220 --> 15:59.180]  That much time minus that much time means I got plenty of more time.
[15:59.180 --> 16:01.020]  That's what that means.
[16:01.020 --> 16:02.100]  I got a message.
[16:02.100 --> 16:03.220]  Where did this one come from?
[16:03.220 --> 16:05.140]  This looks like it came from the website.
[16:05.140 --> 16:05.940]  Yes.
[16:05.940 --> 16:09.140]  On the iReed Genetics website at iReedGenetics.com,
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.300]  there is a Grow Help tab.
[16:10.300 --> 16:14.180]  If you click on that Grow Help tab, we do ask you a few preliminary questions.
[16:14.180 --> 16:17.660]  We basically ask what strain you're growing, where you're growing it.
[16:17.660 --> 16:20.780]  If you're in veg, flour, what kind of medium you're using.
[16:20.780 --> 16:23.020]  Just a few details to help me answer your question.
[16:23.020 --> 16:25.580]  It makes it easier for me when I've got some details.
[16:25.580 --> 16:28.140]  So that is where this question came from.
[16:28.180 --> 16:29.900]  Got a lot of information.
[16:29.900 --> 16:30.740]  It gets down to the point.
[16:30.740 --> 16:32.020]  It says, I love your show so much.
[16:32.020 --> 16:34.180]  I listen to you on the drive to work.
[16:34.180 --> 16:35.580]  You make Mondays awesome.
[16:35.580 --> 16:36.340]  That's great to hear, bro.
[16:36.340 --> 16:36.740]  Thank you.
[16:36.740 --> 16:38.580]  Don't forget about Thursdays.
[16:38.580 --> 16:41.940]  Says, I'm having problems making this post, so my message is shorter now.
[16:41.940 --> 16:44.020]  But could you please talk about enzymes?
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.860]  First off, bro, I'm sorry if the website was giving you shit.
[16:47.860 --> 16:49.860]  I hope you were able to post your questions to the website.
[16:49.860 --> 16:53.100]  Maybe I should check on that because I haven't gotten a question in a minute on there.
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.500]  Somebody send me questions on the website.
[16:54.500 --> 16:55.300]  Go to the Grow Help tab.
[16:55.300 --> 16:55.700]  Hit me up.
[16:55.700 --> 16:56.660]  Make sure I'm getting those.
[16:57.260 --> 16:58.660]  I've got a question.
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.260]  Could you please talk about enzymes?
[17:00.260 --> 17:01.980]  Yes, I will talk about enzymes for you.
[17:01.980 --> 17:03.540]  I wrote notes somewhere.
[17:03.540 --> 17:03.900]  Here they are.
[17:03.900 --> 17:04.900]  They're on this page.
[17:04.900 --> 17:05.700]  Ooh, I got scared.
[17:05.700 --> 17:06.980]  I thought I lost my enzyme notes.
[17:08.380 --> 17:13.660]  Can you talk about enzymes and talk about if I can use them every watering as well as microbes?
[17:13.660 --> 17:17.860]  I just try to beef up non-feed days, or should I use them every time?
[17:19.780 --> 17:23.740]  My first reaction to this was microbes and enzymes every feeding,
[17:23.740 --> 17:25.620]  and I just saw dollar signs coming out.
[17:25.660 --> 17:27.740]  I was like, that's fucking expensive, dude.
[17:27.740 --> 17:29.460]  No, you don't need to do that every time.
[17:29.460 --> 17:31.980]  That's going to get spendy, and that's quite excessive.
[17:33.340 --> 17:34.700]  Those are two expensive products.
[17:34.700 --> 17:39.300]  Enzymes and microbes are like the turbo charge of your grow, and those are expensive.
[17:39.300 --> 17:41.260]  So I wouldn't use those every time.
[17:41.260 --> 17:48.020]  No, I would use them once a week, and I would use them separately in alternate feeding.
[17:48.020 --> 17:52.380]  So if you feed, you're probably going to feed at least two or three times a week.
[17:52.500 --> 17:56.140]  You got two or three separate waterings per week, no matter how big your pots are.
[17:56.140 --> 17:58.180]  So let's say Monday, I like to feed on Monday.
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.260]  Give these bad bitches their main mix and some enzymes, or their main mix and some microbes,
[18:03.260 --> 18:04.620]  one or the other.
[18:04.620 --> 18:07.740]  Then the next feeding, give them their main mix and the other one,
[18:07.740 --> 18:09.380]  whichever one you didn't give them.
[18:09.380 --> 18:10.900]  Give it the main mix.
[18:10.900 --> 18:13.260]  Then that extra nutrient, the enzymes or microbes,
[18:13.260 --> 18:15.020]  sorry, I'm thinking about the next feeding.
[18:15.020 --> 18:16.780]  The next feeding may just be water.
[18:16.780 --> 18:19.460]  I may just give it plain water if you're in a soilless mix.
[18:19.460 --> 18:20.940]  If you're in cocoa, feed it.
[18:20.940 --> 18:22.020]  If you're in hydro, feed it.
[18:22.060 --> 18:26.340]  But the next time, just water, and then two feeds, then water maybe would be what I would do.
[18:26.340 --> 18:32.060]  But let's talk a little bit about these products, these things that you're asking about.
[18:32.060 --> 18:33.060]  Enzymes.
[18:33.060 --> 18:36.060]  Enzymes basically get in your, they've got to be fed in.
[18:36.060 --> 18:37.060]  You can't foliar feed them.
[18:37.060 --> 18:41.500]  Enzymes get down into the root zone and start breaking up any dead,
[18:41.500 --> 18:46.380]  anything that's dead, funky, decaying, dying matter that's not going to be useful to the plant,
[18:46.380 --> 18:47.180]  to the rhizosphere.
[18:47.180 --> 18:48.900]  It gets in there and just eats all the dead shit.
[18:48.900 --> 18:50.620]  That's what the enzymes will do.
[18:50.660 --> 18:52.060]  It kind of works as a cleaner.
[18:52.060 --> 18:55.340]  It cleans and breaks down dead shit in your root zone, dying roots,
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.020]  the root tips that are dying off.
[18:57.020 --> 18:59.420]  If a root grew, thought there was going to be water here,
[18:59.420 --> 19:02.420]  and you quit watering enough to get to water to that zone,
[19:02.420 --> 19:03.740]  when you pour those enzymes in there,
[19:03.740 --> 19:06.500]  they're going to eat that dead shit that died in there next time.
[19:06.500 --> 19:09.220]  They help clean it up, keep it healthy, keep it moving.
[19:09.220 --> 19:11.500]  Kind of like a little, they're the recyclers.
[19:11.500 --> 19:14.260]  They're just in there, the bottom feeders just cleaning shit up in there.
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.660]  So that's enzymes.
[19:16.660 --> 19:20.020]  I do not have the appropriate microscope,
[19:20.020 --> 19:25.700]  nor the appropriate education to tell you if those enzymes are going to damage your microbes.
[19:25.700 --> 19:28.940]  So I feel it would be wise, beneficial to feed them separately.
[19:28.940 --> 19:33.220]  I've seen studies that argue that the enzymes could disrupt the microbes,
[19:33.220 --> 19:35.300]  that the microbes could disrupt the enzymes.
[19:35.300 --> 19:37.900]  I've also seen studies that claim they work together.
[19:37.900 --> 19:41.140]  So find the article that you agree with and follow that one, I guess.
[19:41.140 --> 19:43.140]  But I would feed them separately.
[19:43.140 --> 19:44.100]  So that is enzymes.
[19:44.140 --> 19:46.460]  Enzymes get in there and clean shit up and break it down.
[19:46.460 --> 19:48.660]  That's why you hear enzymatic action.
[19:48.660 --> 19:50.060]  That's they're just breaking shit up.
[19:50.060 --> 19:51.860]  I think of like the little scrubbing bubbles.
[19:51.860 --> 19:53.820]  They're just in there scrubbing and just chewing and just eating,
[19:53.820 --> 19:55.700]  just breaking shit down.
[19:55.700 --> 19:57.460]  Then now let's talk about microbes.
[19:57.460 --> 20:00.620]  We've got a couple of different kinds of microbes that come in mind
[20:00.620 --> 20:02.900]  when we're talking about growing cannabis.
[20:02.900 --> 20:06.780]  We got mycorrhizal fungi and beneficial bacteria.
[20:06.780 --> 20:11.740]  These things have a lot of different functions when it comes to plants.
[20:11.740 --> 20:15.820]  These are the things that basically work between the earth and the plant.
[20:15.820 --> 20:20.620]  They're the communicator between your plant's root zone and the dirt.
[20:20.620 --> 20:23.100]  These things pick up a lot of signals.
[20:23.100 --> 20:24.420]  They tell the plant a lot of things.
[20:24.420 --> 20:25.780]  They deliver a lot of things.
[20:25.780 --> 20:27.860]  They provide a lot of different functions.
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.780]  There are so many different types of microbes and fungi
[20:30.780 --> 20:35.420]  that they all have different jobs but also can perform each other's jobs.
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.260]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[20:36.260 --> 20:38.740]  I am not the microbe expert.
[20:38.860 --> 20:44.420]  My friends Scotty and Guru are fucking overloaded with microbe knowledge.
[20:44.420 --> 20:45.700]  Ask them about microbes.
[20:45.700 --> 20:48.660]  You will get a long, long episode.
[20:48.660 --> 20:50.620]  They're passionate about microbes.
[20:50.620 --> 20:55.380]  But the microbes basically help buffer your soil or soilless mix.
[20:55.380 --> 20:57.820]  They help deliver the nutrients to the plants.
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.140]  They help the plants decide which nutrients they want to be delivered.
[21:02.140 --> 21:03.500]  They – what else do they do?
[21:03.500 --> 21:04.180]  I wrote something else.
[21:04.180 --> 21:07.540]  Oh, they also help convert nutrients into usable food.
[21:07.580 --> 21:10.660]  Sometimes when we're pouring certain things into the rhizosphere there,
[21:10.660 --> 21:12.500]  into the nutrients, into the root zone,
[21:12.500 --> 21:16.380]  some of those things aren't readily available for the plants.
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.340]  Those little microbes go,
[21:17.340 --> 21:20.020]  oh, I got this little thing here and I got to do this to it,
[21:20.020 --> 21:21.700]  womp, womp, womp, and it does a little magic trick.
[21:21.700 --> 21:23.060]  And the plant goes, oh, I can eat that now.
[21:23.060 --> 21:24.020]  Thank you, bro.
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.660]  So it's like just a little buffer, a little in between,
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.900]  between the root zone, the earth so to speak,
[21:28.900 --> 21:30.660]  and the root of the plant.
[21:30.660 --> 21:32.780]  The microbes are the part that talk to that.
[21:32.780 --> 21:37.220]  They're basically – so if the nutrients are the –
[21:37.260 --> 21:39.260]  I'm not going to pick which end of this relationship I want to be.
[21:39.260 --> 21:40.660]  It's a drive-thru window.
[21:40.660 --> 21:41.820]  You got the restaurant,
[21:41.820 --> 21:44.140]  you got the person coming up to the drive-thru.
[21:44.140 --> 21:49.660]  The microbes are the pimply-faced kid passing the burger through the window.
[21:49.660 --> 21:50.700]  Or if you're going to Starbucks,
[21:50.700 --> 21:54.540]  it's the beautiful barista passing the coffee over the window.
[21:54.540 --> 21:55.620]  That's the microbe for you.
[21:55.620 --> 21:57.220]  They provide that relationship.
[21:57.220 --> 21:58.260]  They take the money and they say,
[21:58.260 --> 22:01.700]  hey, we got to give this person this stomachache,
[22:01.700 --> 22:06.260]  fucking toothache, caramel, caffeine, expendi,
[22:06.300 --> 22:07.140]  and they take the money.
[22:07.140 --> 22:08.340]  I'm just making up Starbucks drinks.
[22:08.340 --> 22:10.340]  Couldn't think of one off the top of my head.
[22:10.340 --> 22:12.060]  But they do the exchange for you basically.
[22:12.060 --> 22:14.140]  They take the money and then they give you the drink
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.540]  and they send you on your way.
[22:15.540 --> 22:17.020]  So that's what microbes are doing.
[22:17.020 --> 22:19.940]  And once again, you guys, I am not the scientist.
[22:19.940 --> 22:22.500]  I don't have a microscope or a PhD.
[22:22.500 --> 22:23.980]  I do have grow experience.
[22:23.980 --> 22:25.100]  That's where I think I am valuable.
[22:25.100 --> 22:26.140]  I've got a lot of experience.
[22:26.140 --> 22:29.060]  I understand these plants on a – not like a science level.
[22:29.060 --> 22:29.820]  It's a different level.
[22:29.820 --> 22:31.940]  I just get them and I can teach you that way.
[22:31.940 --> 22:35.020]  Anyway, I'm not trying to defend myself here.
[22:35.420 --> 22:37.300]  I'm just kind of talking a little bit about microbes
[22:37.300 --> 22:39.780]  and enzymes with the level of understanding
[22:39.780 --> 22:42.060]  that I've got trying to let you understand.
[22:42.060 --> 22:44.860]  So I would not use those products.
[22:44.860 --> 22:45.740]  They're expensive, dude.
[22:45.740 --> 22:48.780]  Microbe products and enzymatic products can be very expensive.
[22:48.780 --> 22:50.740]  So don't use them every watering.
[22:50.740 --> 22:52.380]  That's going to get expensive.
[22:52.380 --> 22:54.860]  Also, I don't think it's – there's no – it's not necessary.
[22:54.860 --> 22:56.260]  There's no need for that.
[22:56.260 --> 22:58.540]  But do feed them on separate days.
[22:59.100 --> 23:00.380]  Most of the microbe products,
[23:00.380 --> 23:02.820]  you can follow the instructions with the dosage rate.
[23:02.820 --> 23:03.820]  You're not going to overdo it.
[23:03.820 --> 23:05.860]  You can't overdo it with microbes.
[23:05.860 --> 23:07.300]  The only thing you're doing is wasting money
[23:07.300 --> 23:09.060]  when it gets to be too expensive.
[23:09.060 --> 23:11.180]  Enzymes, I don't know if you could overfeed.
[23:11.180 --> 23:12.500]  Maybe they could cause damage.
[23:12.500 --> 23:15.460]  I've never gotten that far with an enzymatic product before.
[23:16.100 --> 23:17.500]  But I hope I answered your question.
[23:17.500 --> 23:20.580]  This one did come from our buddy P.T. Brad.
[23:20.580 --> 23:22.620]  P.T. Brad, thank you for the great question.
[23:22.620 --> 23:26.220]  I hope we rescued your strawberry shortcake and banana diesel.
[23:26.220 --> 23:28.660]  If you've got any more questions, I do look forward to you
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.460]  sending me more updates.
[23:30.460 --> 23:31.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[23:31.620 --> 23:35.020]  I do, once again, send me those questions on the Grow Help tab
[23:35.020 --> 23:37.180]  because I haven't gotten a message there in a moment.
[23:37.180 --> 23:39.700]  This message reminded me that I don't think that's popping up.
[23:39.700 --> 23:41.860]  You guys might want to test me and send that there.
[23:41.860 --> 23:43.460]  Let me know what it does.
[23:43.460 --> 23:45.620]  I think that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[23:45.620 --> 23:47.620]  I've been going for quite some time now.
[23:47.620 --> 23:49.740]  I don't have enough time to open up another email.
[23:49.740 --> 23:53.060]  So I want to thank you guys for listening to episode 637
[23:53.060 --> 23:55.020]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[23:55.020 --> 23:56.140]  I had fun recording this show.
[23:56.140 --> 23:57.940]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[23:57.940 --> 24:00.980]  Big shout out to my buddy Billy Podunk for hanging out.
[24:01.020 --> 24:02.700]  Let's see, if you've got any questions, corrections,
[24:02.700 --> 24:04.900]  comments or concerns, you know I'd love to hear from you.
[24:04.900 --> 24:09.020]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.

[24:11.780 --> 24:14.260]  Also, I'm trying to read something else around the screen.
[24:14.260 --> 24:15.540]  I skipped a part that was important,
[24:15.540 --> 24:18.820]  but we'll talk about that in another show.
[24:18.820 --> 24:20.260]  If you feel like the episode was educational,
[24:20.260 --> 24:21.340]  informative or entertaining

[24:55.620 --> 24:57.340]  I haven't sent one out this month yet.
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.540]  The only thing I've got to tell you about and advertise
[24:59.540 --> 25:02.460]  is that seed sales event and it is nearly sold out.
[25:02.460 --> 25:04.260]  So make sure you join us for that.
[25:04.260 --> 25:07.060]  But join up on the MailChimp and you will get a newsletter.
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.340]  I try to mail you once a month.
[25:08.340 --> 25:09.700]  I will not spam you too much.
[25:09.700 --> 25:11.020]  I try not to overload you,
[25:11.020 --> 25:13.680]  but I want to keep you in the loop and keep you updated.
[25:13.680 --> 25:14.980]  So check out the website.

[25:20.860 --> 25:22.660]  I'll do my best not to spam you.
[25:22.660 --> 25:24.540]  I think that is all I have got for you.
[25:24.540 --> 25:26.420]  I want to thank you guys again for listening.
[25:26.420 --> 25:29.180]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend Raptor Grow.
[25:29.180 --> 25:31.580]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[25:31.580 --> 25:33.140]  and give your mom a hug for me.
