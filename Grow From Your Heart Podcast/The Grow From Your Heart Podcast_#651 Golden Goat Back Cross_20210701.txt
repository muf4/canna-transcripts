[04:05.120 --> 04:09.120]  do exactly what I was hoping it would do I've got a camera here and there's a camera here
[04:09.120 --> 04:12.040]  what's up guys I don't know if I'm going to use the footage from camera 2 I've got to
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.360]  learn how to edit multi cam footage I've got to make sure that that camera is doing
[04:16.360 --> 04:20.360]  what I think it's doing this one is going to work that one over there I don't know yet

[04:42.320 --> 04:46.520]  camera and lens would not have happened all right I'm trying new equipment so this could

[04:50.160 --> 04:53.400]  confident we may cut this short I don't want to make too long of an episode that could

[04:59.000 --> 05:04.800]  comments and the great feedback on the previous episode on episode 650 you guys left you guys

[05:08.880 --> 05:14.080]  is special for some reason people really like that episode it's gotten a lot of views I'm
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.120]  not sure why I don't know what happened or what I did but it feels like there was some
[05:19.120 --> 05:24.220]  magic in that show that people enjoyed thank you I felt like I was having a good time podcasting
[05:24.220 --> 05:29.060]  I just cut loose and started talking kind of felt like I was in the pocket again sometimes
[05:29.060 --> 05:32.800]  podcasting feels like there's work sometimes it feels like it just flows for that episode
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.120]  I was in the fucking pocket was having a good time this is kind of my Zen zone you
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.080]  guys I got headphones on the world could be crumbling about 15 feet away from me in any
[05:42.080 --> 05:45.920]  direction and I probably wouldn't notice it unless something loud comes through this microphone
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.660]  and we got some filters and stuff cutting out a lot of noise the world could crumble
[05:49.660 --> 05:54.760]  this is my Zen zone I'm here helping the people I've got a plan I got some strategy I know
[05:54.760 --> 05:58.960]  what I'm thinking of what I'm doing you can't really interrupt this so I'm in the zone when
[05:58.960 --> 06:03.560]  I'm doing the podcast I felt like I got really back in the zone and I got back in the zone
[06:03.560 --> 06:08.880]  in this episode I feel myself slipping into it I like it excuse me for that I did take
[06:08.880 --> 06:13.440]  some dabs big shots we're friends at green dot labs for the delicious dabs check out
[06:13.440 --> 06:17.780]  my Instagram so you can see these surveys I've been posting I've been doing little surveys
[06:17.780 --> 06:23.360]  do you prefer rosin or diamonds or diamonds or sauce or rosins or batter maybe check out
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.560]  some of those I re underscore genetics on the Instagram I'm in the pocket and in the
[06:28.560 --> 06:32.400]  zone but I get rambly when I do that so that's a good things I like the flow I like that
[06:32.400 --> 06:35.440]  zone but also I try to keep the show a little bit focused I think you guys like that the
[06:35.440 --> 06:38.360]  balance I try to create anyway thank you for all the words of encouragement in the comments
[06:38.360 --> 06:41.760]  in the last episode you guys that was really cool I'm good and stoned again for another
[06:41.760 --> 06:45.880]  episode hopefully I get as many words of encouragement great feedback great comments that stuff
[06:45.880 --> 06:51.160]  does mean a lot to a podcaster I'm way off topic but hey this is what I'm fucking talking
[06:51.160 --> 06:55.280]  about it this doesn't just happen I don't just like sit down at the table and start
[06:55.280 --> 06:58.660]  going there are two cameras there's lights there's a bunch I got to charge batteries
[06:58.660 --> 07:02.240]  and plug shit in there a lot of cords and plugs you can see all that it's a lot happening
[07:02.240 --> 07:07.280]  so it takes hours out of a day then editing and then just planning it I have to manifest
[07:07.280 --> 07:10.520]  to this show somewhere these ideas have to come somewhere and thank you guys for the
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.680]  listener generated content but there's a lot of work that goes into a podcast so for you
[07:14.680 --> 07:18.960]  to send words of encouragement on YouTube and say bro that last episode was really great

[08:03.760 --> 08:08.600]  for putting it together if you guys ever need anything please let me know I owe you very
[08:08.600 --> 08:14.680]  very what's the word we're just gonna go with bigly I owe you bigly all right that's a great
[08:14.680 --> 08:19.120]  use of camera too I'm using it already I'm proud of myself all right I'm obviously fucking
[08:19.120 --> 08:23.440]  stoned and the question goes that's real quick and simple they're just four questions but
[08:23.440 --> 08:30.440]  they go like this why a golden goat back cross that's a very good question why a golden goat
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.560]  back crosses gives me a doorway to talk a lot I'm gonna kick my feet up on this part
[08:35.560 --> 08:38.720]  of the table here where it's real comfy I'm gonna pull the mic to my face we're gonna
[08:38.720 --> 08:43.200]  talk about a golden goat back cross why a golden goat back cross golden goats really
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.040]  popular it's a really popular strain it kills it in a commercial environment it kills it
[08:48.040 --> 08:53.200]  in a personal grow it has a lot of recreational benefits when I smoke golden goat and golden
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.760]  goat crosses I get really high from it it's got a really nice a recreational high it's
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.960]  a good concert weed it's good getting shit done weed I really like golden goat obviously
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.920]  because I've bred a lot of shit to golden goat it's got that really good head buzz to
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.680]  it it's got good medical qualities to it I can't I'm not a doctor I can't say that
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.160]  it does this it's these these statements have not been proven by the FDA but I've seen it
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.120]  work well for migraines and headaches and women problems when the women are having their
[09:24.120 --> 09:28.280]  their monthly problems the pain it will help with that pain is what I'm told I can't speak
[09:28.280 --> 09:34.440]  on experience in that but I've seen it work so golden goat grows well as a grower as a
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.240]  breeder it breeds fucking fantastically with other things to it gives everything better
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.520]  potency and more vigor so as a breeder it's great for breeding as a grower it will pay
[09:42.520 --> 09:48.280]  the bills it puts out good weight as a consumer either medically or recreationally it is very
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.240]  powerful very potent it does what we need done so it's a very popular strain for several
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.040]  oh and it's also super photogenic and it smells fucking tremendous and it's got great bag
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.680]  appeal so there's like 14 reasons why that strain is amazing and it should be in a lot
[10:01.680 --> 10:10.640]  of grows so it got very popular here in Colorado around 2008 2009 maybe 2010 everybody wanted
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.880]  golden goat it just showed up out of nowhere and it swept the whole fucking commercial
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.520]  scene because it was killing it somebody got it and when somebody gets a clone like that
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.560]  we share it with our friends we try to be we want all of our friends to succeed as well
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.600]  in this industry if we're in a commercial grow we try to share so the clone got around
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.240]  all the commercial grows got it eventually I ended up with it that's another part of
[10:30.240 --> 10:34.200]  the story let's talk about why how it got popular and then let's talk about a couple
[10:34.200 --> 10:40.240]  other things why a back cross so people got the clone it got popular people would come
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.300]  to Colorado and smoke golden goat then they would go home and want to grow weed and now
[10:44.300 --> 10:48.680]  they want to grow golden goat this is where the back cross seeds are going to come in
[10:48.680 --> 10:53.240]  the strain got super popular for several reasons people wanted to grow it when they went back
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.240]  home or maybe in other countries or other places which will lead to why I made the golden
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.560]  goat as well now unfortunately golden goat is what is known was known as a clone only
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.920]  plant I've touched on the phrase clone only before here's a good opportunity to ramble
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.400]  about clone only a clone only means that it's clone only the breeder of that plant who I'm
[11:13.400 --> 11:18.680]  going to touch on that in just a moment Mr. Dank a person named Mr. Dank in Topeka Kansas
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.760]  made the golden goat Mr. Dank never released other seeds of the golden goat cross there
[11:24.760 --> 11:29.520]  was a cross that happened the seeds that came out were grown a couple of those were
[11:29.520 --> 11:34.600]  selected some of them were tossed I know that one of them we know that one of them became
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.040]  the golden goat so that's a clone only plant called the golden goat here is the golden
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.240]  goat the specific selected plant the breeder cut the one that that person chose it is right
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.440]  here it is golden goat there was another one I think it was named funky bitch I don't know
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.080]  what happened to that one but it came out of the same batch to the best of my knowledge
[11:52.080 --> 11:56.560]  I could be wrong if anybody has updates data info please send that to my email at grow
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.000]  from your heart at hotmail.com if anyone's connected with Mr. Dank put me in touch I'd
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.120]  like to know more of the story just because that's part of my job I'm kind of the historian
[12:04.120 --> 12:09.160]  here so the golden goat it is clone only now there were no seeds released there were no
[12:09.160 --> 12:16.020]  other plants released just that clone which means there's no way to make seeds of it because
[12:16.020 --> 12:21.860]  we need a male plant you can't make you can't make something you can't make more of something
[12:21.860 --> 12:27.180]  without a male and female of that if we were to cross that golden goat with something to
[12:27.180 --> 12:32.580]  make seeds of it it would be adulterating it the subsequent cross will not be pure golden
[12:32.580 --> 12:38.620]  goat it will be golden goat crossed to a male plant to make seeds so this is where the back
[12:38.620 --> 12:43.520]  cross idea comes in people want seeds but for some reason I know the re there are several
[12:43.520 --> 12:47.140]  reasons we don't need to touch on those reasons right now there are several reasons why people
[12:47.140 --> 12:53.100]  do not trust believe or even want to mess with feminized seeds I offer golden goat in
[12:53.100 --> 12:59.300]  a feminized seed which means I did not adulterate or change the or alter that plant that golden
[12:59.300 --> 13:03.260]  goat plant in any way it is golden goat to pure golden goat I've talked about feminized
[13:03.260 --> 13:07.580]  seeds in a lot of other episodes I took a golden goat female and another golden goat
[13:07.580 --> 13:12.660]  female I treated one with the solution that solution made the golden goat turn into it
[13:12.660 --> 13:17.900]  made it create pollen sacks which only contain female pollen to be quite brief about it I put
[13:17.900 --> 13:22.760]  that female pollen on the other female golden goat we have now made all female all golden
[13:22.760 --> 13:28.500]  goat seeds it's what they would say all og dead stock golden goat that's a sneakerhead joke but
[13:28.500 --> 13:33.220]  some of you will get it with me now some people don't like them and I seeds they have misinformation
[13:33.220 --> 13:38.860]  or have had bad experiences and that comes from past breeders back in the day not doing fem seeds
[13:38.860 --> 13:43.740]  correctly not having good morals we've come a long way since those days so now we know how to
[13:43.740 --> 13:47.780]  make I know how to make quality feminized seeds I test them I do a good job that's another ramble
[13:47.780 --> 13:52.180]  for another day so people don't like FEMS so they want the golden goat but they don't want
[13:52.180 --> 13:57.420]  feminized seeds but it's only a clone plant so we've got to do something to make golden goat
[13:57.420 --> 14:03.260]  seeds the way to do this is bat cross this is where bat cross comes in that's fucking six minutes of
[14:03.260 --> 14:07.980]  talking to get to the point but welcome to the show you've never been here before have you um
[14:08.300 --> 14:13.620]  anyway golden goat bat cross why bat cross because there's no male to make the original people don't
[14:13.620 --> 14:18.540]  want FEMS we got to go another route I've got the original female let's make a bat cross it's gonna
[14:18.540 --> 14:22.740]  take some work but we can make some seeds that come out very close to the original golden goat
[14:22.740 --> 14:26.940]  and that's gonna be a bat cross I've got the female so I know what I'm looking for I've got
[14:26.940 --> 14:31.580]  this girl I know how she grows I know what the leaves are shaped like I know how she smells I
[14:31.580 --> 14:35.860]  know how she responds to light nutrients manipulation of all different types I can
[14:35.860 --> 14:40.180]  bend or twist or pop or pull leaves off I know how this plant responds I've been working with
[14:40.180 --> 14:45.540]  this plant since probably I'm gonna be generous and say 2008 no I'm gonna I'm gonna be what's the
[14:45.540 --> 14:51.140]  other word modest and say 2010 that's the one I'm looking for I'm gonna be modest and say 2010
[14:51.140 --> 14:56.540]  generous would be 2008 so I've had this plant for years we're in 2021 at the time of this recording
[14:56.540 --> 15:03.980]  halfway through tomorrow will be the first of the halfway point so I want to make I want to make
[15:03.980 --> 15:07.780]  fucking seeds out of this I'm back on track now my brain got lost for a minute to be honest with
[15:07.780 --> 15:15.820]  you so I've got the female I know what she looks like to make a bat cross I decided to find a male
[15:15.820 --> 15:20.580]  plant that was completely different than the golden goat completely different than the golden
[15:20.580 --> 15:25.380]  goat why because I'm going to pollinate the golden goat with this male plant and it's going to make
[15:25.380 --> 15:33.480]  seeds now that is going to be a I used a daybreaker plant daybreaker was the complete opposite of the
[15:33.480 --> 15:39.360]  golden goat golden goat kind of had these long skinny leaves it made tall skinny buds the day
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.440]  breaker made like these golf balls on long skinny stems I knew that it would be just a really
[15:45.440 --> 15:52.280]  different cross so I crossed those and I knew that I would be able to see the golden goat looking
[15:52.280 --> 15:57.000]  phenotypes that came out of the progeny the offspring of those two being crossed I took the
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.800]  tall skinny plant with the skinny leaves and the short squatty plant with the big wide leaves and
[16:02.920 --> 16:08.680]  I crossed that and then I could tell when the seeds grew later I could tell which seeds had
[16:08.680 --> 16:12.840]  the big giant leaves and which seeds had the little skinny golden goat leaves so if it showed
[16:12.840 --> 16:17.760]  me that it looked like the daybreaker at all if it had that big fat leaf I just got rid of it if
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.520]  it had the skinny golden goat leaf I kept it and I kept it a little longer and saw how it grew if
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.240]  it showed me that it was a girl I got rid of that I got a golden goat girl already I don't need that
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.480]  I'm looking for a golden goat male so I went through a few seeds I don't even remember exactly
[16:31.480 --> 16:37.240]  how many there were a lot of them I went through seeds until I found a male plant out of that
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.240]  batch of seeds it was the original golden goat pollinated by a daybreaker male I took seeds I
[16:42.240 --> 16:48.640]  grew out a bunch of seeds I found a boy plant that mirrored the female original golden goat plant
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.400]  the original female looks just like this boy when I rub the stems and smell my fingers I can't tell
[16:54.400 --> 16:59.200]  a difference I would pull leaves off of both plants and held them up next to each other the
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.440]  shapes of the leaves were exactly the same the serrations of the leaves are the same the veins
[17:03.440 --> 17:08.920]  up the leaves were the same golden goat has a very distinct growth pattern once you grow her a couple
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.480]  of times and you find the phenotype I'm talking about or if you've grown the clone only version
[17:13.480 --> 17:19.040]  you will definitely see that distinct growth pattern she almost does it almost looks like a
[17:19.040 --> 17:24.200]  twisting she's almost trying to make more branches more space she wants to grow more the leaves come
[17:24.200 --> 17:28.760]  out kind of weird at first when she goes into flower she looks a little bit strange and as she
[17:28.800 --> 17:38.160]  transitions you will see that where am I what was I saying golden goat oh it looks just it matches
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.000]  sorry I'm fucking I got stone it got lost it matches it looks it does the same transition
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.560]  it does the same twisting I'm not even gonna edit that I'm gonna leave that in there I'm telling you
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.400]  guys I got fucking stone before this episode and I'm just in the flow so it does the same twisting
[17:51.400 --> 17:55.120]  it does the same thing at the start of flower it looks just like the original female so I got the
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.160]  boy that looks just like the original female now the step now is to take that male plant and
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.800]  pollinate that male plant that looks just like golden goat and pollinate the original golden
[18:05.800 --> 18:13.560]  goat now this plant over here the male is 50% golden goat and 50% daybreaker but from my selection
[18:13.560 --> 18:23.000]  I think I chose a plant that is probably 75 70 I'm gonna say 75 to 85 percent maybe 70 to 80 percent
[18:23.080 --> 18:29.360]  golden goat it is a 5050 cross but I chose one that kind of with genetics there's a phenotype
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.000]  that leans a little bit more toward one parent just like if you got brothers and sisters one
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.080]  looks more like mom one looks more like dad I found one that looked more like mom so this one
[18:39.080 --> 18:45.360]  probably 70 75 percent golden goat 25 percent daybreaker I pollinate the original golden goat
[18:45.360 --> 18:51.840]  now you're going like 75 to 100 percent I think in my experience from what I'm looking at through
[18:51.840 --> 18:58.040]  test growers through product through consumer grows through my grows these golden goat back
[18:58.040 --> 19:05.000]  cross ones are producing about 70 to 80 percent reliable golden goat looking phenotypes maybe a
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.480]  little more maybe about 82 percent if I did it again I would find so that is a golden goat
[19:11.480 --> 19:16.840]  back cross let me let me stop right here and then we'll talk about doing it again so I took the the
[19:16.840 --> 19:23.000]  gold the daybreaker male pollinated the golden goat found a male that looks just like golden goat
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.800]  and repollinated a golden goat again and grew up grew out those seeds which are the golden
[19:28.800 --> 19:34.720]  goat back cross number one now I want to find a male out of that that looks just like the golden
[19:34.720 --> 19:40.320]  goat again and hit the golden goat with that again and that'll be a back cross to which should come
[19:40.320 --> 19:48.280]  out 83 to 89 percent it's a mathematical equation but it also depends on my selection that I choose
[19:48.280 --> 19:53.800]  the appropriate males for each back cross because if I don't choose the appropriate male none of it
[19:53.800 --> 19:58.760]  will go correctly I've got to choose the male it's the eye for breeding the eye for detail the
[19:58.760 --> 20:04.000]  relationship with the plant so then I just keep doing that I keep finding a male plant out of the
[20:04.000 --> 20:10.080]  mix of new seeds and repollinating that original female and if I do my selection properly every
[20:10.080 --> 20:16.160]  time I do that with each back cross it gets closer and closer and closer to the original golden goat
[20:16.160 --> 20:22.520]  the first one was very successful in my opinion I think in my selection process I chose the right
[20:22.520 --> 20:29.240]  male that gave me building blocks for success I really set myself up for success having 80%
[20:29.240 --> 20:34.480]  phenotypes that look like the goal is huge success in my opinion the next time I do it it's gonna be
[20:35.040 --> 20:41.680]  82 85 87 percent that's a lot of percentage that's looking like the goal on the second attempt and
[20:41.680 --> 20:46.200]  we're getting really close to a hundred I don't think I don't know that I can get to a hundred in
[20:46.200 --> 20:50.440]  genetics I think that there's always going to be some uniformity the trick to getting to a hundred
[20:50.440 --> 20:54.480]  is running larger numbers so that your variables don't show up as often your mutants and your
[20:54.480 --> 20:59.280]  strange your your anomalies don't pop up as randomly that's one of the keys to getting better
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.920]  numbers but I'm gonna get back on track here so the question was why golden goat back cross
[21:04.920 --> 21:10.800]  because there is no male of the golden goat to make more golden goat plants so therefore it is
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.880]  a clone only it could be feminized but a lot of people are not into the feminized seeds because
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.080]  of old breeding techniques myths rumors misconceptions around feminized seeds and
[21:21.080 --> 21:27.240]  back cross because that's the only way to make seeds out of it how to do it I think I explained
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.880]  that cross it with something adulterated is the word there then kind of wash out what you've
[21:32.880 --> 21:36.880]  adulterated it with you've got to breathe that part out if you do your selection properly it
[21:36.880 --> 21:42.000]  only takes a couple of times I want to give a shout out to my buddy Pete we call him f1 Pete
[21:42.000 --> 21:49.800]  PL grow Pete one bad motherfucker Pete Pete what's up bro not only are you a great person in the
[21:49.800 --> 21:53.120]  community I think you're a good friend bro you're my friend I'm not gonna get all gushy here on the
[21:53.120 --> 21:58.880]  show but Pete's my friend and I learn a lot from Pete Pete is very intelligent Pete is forward
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.360]  thinking Pete is Pete's fucking smarter than me to be quite frank and Pete teaches me a lot and
[22:04.360 --> 22:08.680]  I'm going to go ahead and give Pete credit for what I'm about to say I've been labeling the
[22:08.680 --> 22:15.400]  cannabis community has been labeling bat crosses as a BX we say BX 1 BX 2 it sounds good it rolls
[22:15.400 --> 22:20.800]  off the tongue nice it looks good on a package Pete's right when he says that bat cross should
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.520]  be labeled BC that's a back cross but the reason I always thought BX look good is because you do
[22:26.520 --> 22:31.120]  like strain a X strain to like you're doing fucking algebra here it's this one times this
[22:31.120 --> 22:34.840]  one and I don't like to say times I say to or crossed or something I don't even know what I
[22:34.840 --> 22:40.840]  say naturally anymore I say so many things but it just looks like X you got the X in there so it's
[22:40.840 --> 22:46.920]  like back crossed because you would always say like a rise cross to strawberry fields or something
[22:46.920 --> 22:54.040]  or Ninja Turtles cross to GI Joe and so back cross crosses in there so just we were saying
[22:54.040 --> 23:02.280]  back cross but Pete's right bro BC back cross BC one back cross one BC two back cross two don't
[23:02.280 --> 23:06.560]  get misled by labeling don't get too caught up by labeling but also those labels are really important
[23:06.560 --> 23:10.920]  so if you're the one making the labels get caught up in them and get them correct please shout out
[23:10.920 --> 23:16.040]  to my buddy Pete shout out to Pete all right um there are more questions how long have I been
[23:16.160 --> 23:21.680]  going you know I think I'm going to quit while I'm ahead because there are let's tell the story
[23:21.680 --> 23:25.320]  of Golden Goat is the next question on here and then we'll cover the next two questions in the
[23:25.320 --> 23:29.880]  next episode after we do some camera adjustments and we'll do two episodes today we'll record to
[23:29.880 --> 23:35.360]  see if we can get this shit correct um what is the story of Golden Goat I just tried to wet my
[23:35.360 --> 23:38.760]  lips and I think I licked the mic I'm not even gonna edit that out I'm human you guys I do a
[23:38.760 --> 23:45.880]  lot of weird shit especially on this episode um uh story of Golden Goat so Golden Goat to the best
[23:45.880 --> 23:52.560]  of my knowledge was created on accident by a guy known as Mr. Dank who was in Topeka Kansas it was
[23:52.560 --> 23:57.960]  an island sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa plant pollinate nose Hawaiian sweet skunk and Romulan
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.800]  plant okay the three ingredients are Hawaiian sweet skunk Island sativa and Romulan my brain
[24:03.800 --> 24:09.280]  is cock blocking me on which order that went in one of those plants accidentally pollinated the
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.920]  Hawaiian sweet skunk nose Hawaiian sativa to Romulan was pollinated let's just google it we
[24:14.920 --> 24:22.200]  have a Googler right here to the Hawaiian sativa to Romulan so it was a Hawaiian sativa to Romulan
[24:22.200 --> 24:28.520]  plant was the male Hawaiian sativa crossed Romulan so it's a Romulan boy pollinated Hawaiian sativa
[24:28.520 --> 24:34.400]  that became a plant then that accidentally accidentally pollinated an island sweet skunk
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.480]  plant so it was an accidental pollination so mr. dank had an accidental pollination in his garden
[24:39.480 --> 24:44.920]  then that made the golden goat those seeds were allowed to continue allowed to pollinate allowed
[24:44.920 --> 24:51.200]  to finish allowed to maturate mature rise to finish whatever dude they were done they hardened up bro
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.680]  then those seeds were taken out of the plant they were harvested and mr. dank apparently grew them
[24:55.680 --> 25:01.600]  one of the seeds he grew became the golden goat that golden goat passed the fucking standards it
[25:01.600 --> 25:07.380]  was a champion so it became popular that's the story of where the golden goat came from the
[25:07.380 --> 25:13.100]  reason it was named golden goat is because in Topeka Kansas there is a recycling center that
[25:13.100 --> 25:20.900]  recycles soda cans and mr. dank thought that the golden goat plant smelled like the sticky sweet
[25:20.900 --> 25:26.700]  syrupy smells of the golden goat recycling center in the middle of the summer in Topeka Kansas and
[25:26.700 --> 25:30.940]  Topeka it is like hot and sticky I lived in Lawrence for a little while we used to go to
[25:30.940 --> 25:37.020]  Topeka to cause trouble it was gross it's kind of sticky and funky and I'm sure that if there was a
[25:37.020 --> 25:41.180]  recycling center with sticky syrup in the air you would smell it for a while and it probably
[25:41.180 --> 25:46.020]  smelled quite delicious in that hot Sun that sticky sweet soda flavor I could smell it right
[25:46.020 --> 25:51.180]  now I could smell the golden goat just permeating my brain right now so that's where the name came
[25:51.180 --> 25:56.580]  from is accidentally made by mr. dank in Topeka Kansas who was named because of the golden goat
[25:56.580 --> 26:02.860]  recycling center now here's something I really want to touch on um this plant was an accident
[26:02.860 --> 26:08.500]  so technically like if you really wanted to find a name for it this wasn't a breeding project to
[26:08.500 --> 26:14.620]  the best of my knowledge this wasn't done on purpose this would be bag seed right this is
[26:14.620 --> 26:19.180]  what this is the kind of seed if this breeder didn't realize there were seeds in there he cut
[26:19.180 --> 26:23.780]  down his crop he dried it he cured it he put it out to market like a lot of people do and you found
[26:23.780 --> 26:28.380]  the bag or the seed in one of your buds you put it you put it in your grinder you give it a twist
[26:28.380 --> 26:31.660]  and you feel that little what is that and you open it up there's a fucking couple of seeds in there
[26:31.820 --> 26:36.940]  that would be considered bag seed if you had grown this and you found this plant and you had the bright
[26:36.940 --> 26:41.100]  idea to call it golden goat also you would have been growing bag seed and you would have found
[26:41.100 --> 26:46.020]  one of the champion fucking plants one of the best plants on the planet in my opinion it breeds well
[26:46.020 --> 26:51.740]  I've read a lot of shit to it I'm going to continue to breed a lot of shit to it but the person that
[26:51.740 --> 26:55.940]  would have found this would have called it bag seed luckily the breeder pulled it out of the
[26:55.940 --> 27:00.420]  the plant or his own bag and it got called something cool and it got spread out as a clone
[27:00.420 --> 27:08.180]  only it was bag seed though technically so my point is don't judge your bag seed by the cover
[27:08.180 --> 27:13.340]  if the herb you got your seed from was good or even if the herb you got your bag seed from was
[27:13.340 --> 27:21.140]  mediocre you could have high high quality herb golden goat was an accident in my opinion gorilla
[27:21.140 --> 27:28.260]  glue was probably an accident I think cookies was probably an accident the chem line all of the chem
[27:28.380 --> 27:36.740]  dog stuff that we love we know the chem 91 chem sister chem D chem for all of the chem dog crosses
[27:36.740 --> 27:43.220]  all of the chem dog stuff not the crosses but the chem dog the original 13 seeds minus the males came
[27:43.220 --> 27:49.700]  from what would be known as bag seed and chem dog is one of the best of that camera over there just
[27:49.700 --> 27:55.020]  gave up so we'll see oh I didn't put on the auto temp shut off I knew I messed something up see
[27:55.020 --> 27:59.580]  you guys I'm glad I didn't rely on that camera um so we got to switch the auto the heat thing I'm
[27:59.580 --> 28:04.460]  gonna write that down heat on the other one when that one hits 30 minutes or gets too hot it shuts
[28:04.460 --> 28:13.260]  the fuck off so where this shit was I Topeka Kansas bag seed clone only so a lot of those strains were
[28:13.260 --> 28:18.780]  clone only the chem dog stuff all of the chem dog stuff was clone only a lot of the popular stuff
[28:18.780 --> 28:23.860]  now or a lot of the chem dog stuff I'm sorry I got distracted was from a bag see there were 13 seeds
[28:23.860 --> 28:29.060]  that chem dog got he grew a lot of them he found a lot of gems in bag seed you guys then a lot of
[28:29.060 --> 28:32.900]  those were bred to and became a lot of the popular strains that we were working with now a lot of the
[28:32.900 --> 28:40.900]  stinky skinky that's stinky and skunky shit was from the chem dog lineage and that is bag seed
[28:40.900 --> 28:47.820]  so my point is I want to my one of my fucking points today is don't misjudge your bag seed you
[28:47.820 --> 28:53.740]  could have amazing shit in that bag or you could have complete trash the key is that you grow it
[28:53.780 --> 28:57.820]  out you pay attention you don't give it out to somebody else and you know that you're playing
[28:57.820 --> 29:02.500]  with fireworks you could have something that's gonna blow up at week 9 to be fully Herm's I could
[29:02.500 --> 29:07.540]  be a mess it could be a problem it could be a full fucking mutant it might not even be worth putting
[29:07.540 --> 29:13.260]  in your flower room you might discover that early in veg or late in veg or or just maybe or you
[29:13.260 --> 29:19.660]  could be growing the next golden goat the next chem dog you may have just created or discovered the
[29:19.660 --> 29:27.460]  next Girl Scout gorilla goat cookie chem whatever magic you get to name it whatever you want that
[29:27.460 --> 29:31.620]  is your brand new thing that you just discovered just when you talk about it just like no it's a
[29:31.620 --> 29:35.660]  bag seed that I found here and I called it this and I've been playing with it and growing it if
[29:35.660 --> 29:41.300]  you want to put clones of it out you can that is it's kind of it's your new thing so yep that is
[29:41.300 --> 29:46.900]  the quick version of the golden goat story and that led me into talking about bag seed and clone
[29:46.900 --> 29:53.140]  only once again clone only it's clone only because there was never a male of that golden goat put out
[29:53.140 --> 29:58.460]  so nobody got to breed to it there were no seeds put out so nobody got to breed more of it I got
[29:58.460 --> 30:04.900]  the clone I made bat crosses of it I made fem seeds of it big shout out to my buddy we're gonna call
[30:04.900 --> 30:08.300]  him pineapple Express I don't know if he listens to the show I don't know if he's still around town
[30:08.300 --> 30:13.780]  haven't heard from him in a minute he got married and had kids and kind of you know how people fall
[30:13.780 --> 30:17.460]  off the face of the earth he did one of those moves but big shout out my buddy pineapple Express
[30:17.460 --> 30:21.780]  that is where that clone came from that's how I got the golden goat I think it originated from
[30:21.780 --> 30:28.380]  kind love then I ended up with it from my friend Pocca Lolo pineapple Express yeah the dudes from
[30:28.380 --> 30:33.060]  Hawaiian from Hawaii he got a cliche nickname alright you guys that camera failing and dying
[30:33.060 --> 30:37.380]  over there distracted me the point of me doing this recording mainly was to see if I had the
[30:37.380 --> 30:41.740]  gear right I don't so I've got some adjustments to make I'm gonna edit this show out see how it
[30:41.740 --> 30:45.060]  came out and then I'll probably come back and edit another one after I fix the settings on that
