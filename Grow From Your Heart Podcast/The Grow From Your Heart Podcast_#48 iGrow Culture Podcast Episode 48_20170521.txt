[00:16.700 --> 00:21.500]  Yeah, what's up guys? It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.500 --> 00:25.140]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation. Welcome. It's episode number
[00:25.140 --> 00:29.980]  48. We're creeping up on number 50. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and I am dabbed the fuck
[00:29.980 --> 00:34.620]  out, but I've got good reason. We are joined today by Spence and Maddie from the Garden
[00:34.620 --> 00:36.700]  of Weeden. How you guys doing over there?
[00:36.700 --> 00:38.260]  We're doing good. Smoking OG.
[00:38.260 --> 00:42.020]  Damn, I'm yelling into that mic. That music was loud. I apologize for yelling at everybody.
[00:42.020 --> 00:45.020]  Holy shit. Maddie, I'm going to push the mic right in your face so that we can hear you.
[00:45.020 --> 00:47.340]  Yeah, there you go. How you doing, Spence?
[00:47.340 --> 00:48.340]  What up?
[00:48.340 --> 00:49.340]  What up?
[00:49.340 --> 00:52.100]  I'm high. We were just smoking through the OG.
[00:52.100 --> 00:53.100]  Oh my God.
[00:53.100 --> 00:55.420]  Started the podcast off a little crazy.
[00:55.420 --> 00:59.620]  Well, that's tradition over here, but I think we kind of went a little extra today. Holy
[00:59.620 --> 01:03.180]  crap. You guys said you wanted to go hard on the dabs and we did it. The first thing
[01:03.180 --> 01:06.220]  Maddie said when she walked into the house was, I need a dab.
[01:06.220 --> 01:09.020]  And I got one. Well, I got two so far.
[01:09.020 --> 01:12.420]  Well, welcome. If you need another one, dude, there's dabs over here. I've got the email
[01:12.420 --> 01:16.380]  and email tech for the G-mail. We keep it on most of the time.
[01:16.380 --> 01:20.780]  I was complimenting the USB port that he installed into it.
[01:20.780 --> 01:25.100]  Isn't that dope? Charge your phone all the time while you're taking dabs.
[01:25.100 --> 01:26.340]  And on Instagram.
[01:26.340 --> 01:29.340]  And on Instagram, you charge your phone, take dabs and be on Instagram. Is that what you're
[01:29.340 --> 01:30.340]  doing over there?
[01:30.340 --> 01:31.340]  Pretty much.
[01:31.340 --> 01:34.660]  I got a lot of questions for you, bro. So you got to be a part of this show. You're
[01:34.660 --> 01:38.420]  going to wake up. Maddie, you are a... Go ahead and drag the chair around.
[01:38.420 --> 01:39.420]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:39.420 --> 01:40.420]  Go ahead.
[01:40.420 --> 01:41.420]  Go ahead and scrape it around. There you go.
[01:41.420 --> 01:42.420]  Yeah.
[01:42.420 --> 01:48.500]  So this headphone mic is fucking up. Don't ever buy the Live Wire Solutions HA04. Don't
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.700]  ever buy one of those. It's a piece of shit. Get a better product.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.700]  Negative shout out.
[01:51.700 --> 01:55.580]  Yeah. I hate that piece. It craps out on us a lot. So we were saying that Maddie was going
[01:55.580 --> 01:59.980]  to be the first female on the show. Actually, that's inaccurate because I took the podcast
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.500]  to the Brickyard one time and we had...
[02:02.500 --> 02:04.700]  You made me feel special for a second.
[02:04.700 --> 02:07.820]  You're going to be special in just a second. OK, I'm going to skip bragging on the other
[02:07.820 --> 02:10.820]  people that were. There were other females, but you're the first female to be here on
[02:10.820 --> 02:13.540]  the show. We went somewhere else and there were females there that were on the show.
[02:13.540 --> 02:15.740]  But you're the first lady to come be in the IRIE studio.
[02:15.740 --> 02:16.740]  Home field.
[02:16.740 --> 02:17.740]  So welcome.
[02:17.740 --> 02:18.740]  Thank you. I appreciate it.
[02:18.740 --> 02:19.740]  Oh, glad to have you here.
[02:19.740 --> 02:24.300]  It's a big accomplishment. Is Spencer the first black person on the podcast?
[02:24.300 --> 02:25.300]  Spencer's probably the first.
[02:25.300 --> 02:28.620]  I'm always the first black person in anything Jeff does.
[02:28.620 --> 02:32.500]  Yeah, he's the first black person in my house. So yeah, shout out to that.
[02:32.500 --> 02:35.860]  Not in a bad way, though. Just a coincidence.
[02:35.860 --> 02:38.660]  There's any other black people around here. We live in fucking Pueblo.
[02:38.660 --> 02:39.660]  True.
[02:39.660 --> 02:41.420]  There's a lot of white people and a lot of Mexicans here.
[02:41.420 --> 02:42.420]  But you know, it's just because where we live.
[02:42.420 --> 02:43.420]  I was supposed to say that.
[02:43.420 --> 02:45.740]  Oh, yeah. Everybody knows about Pueblo by now. You could say where we are.
[02:45.740 --> 02:47.180]  These guys came in to visit me.
[02:47.180 --> 02:50.100]  So welcome to the show, you guys. I like having some of my best friends here.
[02:50.100 --> 02:52.580]  I have to do a couple of ads right quick. That's tradition.

[03:36.380 --> 03:38.940]  Yeah, big shout out. Dude, I saw those trays you got.
[03:38.940 --> 03:40.540]  Those are dope. I think I'm going to copy you.
[03:40.540 --> 03:43.060]  I work there part time now. So also come check me out.
[03:43.060 --> 03:45.940]  I will be there two days a week now.
[03:46.260 --> 03:48.100]  You can go see Miss Whedon and Stalker.
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.380]  I don't know if you wanted to say that on the show.
[03:49.380 --> 03:50.180]  You might get some stalkers.
[03:50.180 --> 03:52.580]  No, it's OK. I'm happy to help.
[03:52.580 --> 03:53.980]  I'm happy to help people.
[03:53.980 --> 03:56.420]  I'm enjoying it. I'm learning a lot from it.
[03:56.420 --> 03:58.620]  Actually, a lot more than I thought.
[03:59.140 --> 04:01.380]  It's great to have my friends working at hydro shops.
[04:01.380 --> 04:03.540]  When I go in there, you don't try to hustle me and sell me some shit.
[04:03.540 --> 04:07.580]  For sure. I definitely think Hygro Pueblo has the best prices in town.
[04:08.060 --> 04:10.820]  Actually, if you listen to the I Grow Culture or the Grow From Your Heart
[04:10.820 --> 04:12.100]  podcast, we're changing the name, you guys.
[04:12.100 --> 04:14.220]  I'm going to stutter and say the wrong name a few times.
[04:14.220 --> 04:16.660]  I'll remind you about that later on in the show.
[04:16.660 --> 04:18.620]  If you go in there and you tell me, listen to this podcast,
[04:18.620 --> 04:21.460]  you will get commercial pricing on everything you buy.
[04:23.300 --> 04:26.060]  Maddie's looking at me like, Maddie didn't know how to do that.
[04:26.060 --> 04:28.340]  She's going, I might have to learn how to work the cash register.
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.180]  That's new shit.
[04:30.660 --> 04:32.700]  That's all the ads. Let's not do any more commercials.
[04:32.700 --> 04:35.540]  Everybody else that paid for ads, you'll get them some other time.
[04:36.260 --> 04:37.980]  That's cool. All right.
[04:37.980 --> 04:40.540]  So I got to do also a shout out to Mystic Roots for letting me play their music.
[04:40.540 --> 04:41.820]  They let me play all of their music.
[04:41.820 --> 04:43.420]  They gave me full access to everything.
[04:43.420 --> 04:44.420]  That's kind of cool.
[04:44.420 --> 04:46.460]  Yeah, that's usually that costs a lot of money for a band.
[04:46.460 --> 04:48.100]  Shout out to them.
[04:48.100 --> 04:49.060]  Yeah. What was it?
[04:49.060 --> 04:50.220]  Shout out to Peaches.
[04:50.220 --> 04:51.980]  Is it Peaches or Pears?
[04:51.980 --> 04:53.020]  Shout out to Pears.
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.020]  Shout out to Pears.
[04:54.020 --> 04:55.780]  Oh, Jeff is in on it.
[04:55.780 --> 04:57.220]  I know it's a big mic.
[04:57.220 --> 04:59.660]  I wish you were here with the crew, but someone's got to take care of the dogs.
[05:00.540 --> 05:01.980]  Shout out to Sirak at Nana.
[05:01.980 --> 05:02.900]  Scratches on the head.
[05:02.900 --> 05:03.780]  Hey, when is this posted?
[05:03.780 --> 05:05.060]  Monday? Yeah, Monday morning.
[05:05.060 --> 05:05.860]  710 in the morning.
[05:05.860 --> 05:07.380]  I got people asking me already.
[05:07.380 --> 05:08.980]  Nice. Nice.
[05:08.980 --> 05:11.220]  I hope you guys are following everybody on Instagram and stuff.
[05:11.700 --> 05:13.620]  All right. So, dude, we just took some dabs.
[05:13.620 --> 05:15.140]  I want to give Spence a huge shout out on the show.
[05:15.140 --> 05:17.340]  Spence taught me how to make my own dabs.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.660]  That's freaking awesome.
[05:18.660 --> 05:20.940]  I appreciate it. I'm self-sufficient.
[05:20.940 --> 05:24.180]  It's great to learn from one of who I consider the masters and also a brother.
[05:24.180 --> 05:26.460]  So it means a lot. Thanks a lot, bro.
[05:26.460 --> 05:27.260]  No problem, bro.
[05:27.260 --> 05:29.260]  Well, it's about time you have great product.
[05:29.260 --> 05:32.260]  So in turn, that's going to make great oil.
[05:32.620 --> 05:33.900]  I appreciate that.
[05:33.900 --> 05:35.060]  I want to brag on Maddie.
[05:35.060 --> 05:36.260]  I want to tell a story about Maddie.
[05:36.260 --> 05:37.660]  Introduce you guys.
[05:37.900 --> 05:39.060]  Maddie and Spence hang out together.
[05:39.060 --> 05:40.420]  They live together. That's how I met them.
[05:40.420 --> 05:43.860]  So one time Spence made Earl and Maddie.
[05:44.260 --> 05:46.380]  She's great already. She knows where I'm headed with this.
[05:46.380 --> 05:49.620]  She took that Pyrex dish that had a little bit of BHO left in the bottom
[05:49.620 --> 05:51.300]  that we didn't feel like scraping out.
[05:51.300 --> 05:54.340]  And she decided to heat it up and make brownies in that pan
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.140]  with the BHO mix in there.
[05:56.140 --> 06:00.580]  And she's laughing because Spence and I are on the six, four, six, five level of life,
[06:01.460 --> 06:03.260]  close to 200 pounds each.
[06:03.260 --> 06:06.100]  And there was another guy and another guy in the room that's about the same
[06:06.100 --> 06:07.340]  same weight class.
[06:07.340 --> 06:10.980]  And she fucking wrecked four dudes, maybe five or six dudes.
[06:10.980 --> 06:14.620]  And I didn't even know that that it was going to be that potent.
[06:14.620 --> 06:15.820]  Oh, my God.
[06:15.820 --> 06:21.700]  The whole outer layer of the brownie was literally covered in a layer of shatter
[06:21.700 --> 06:26.820]  almost and it coated inside of the brownie, but it worked itself in perfectly to where
[06:27.580 --> 06:29.180]  it got us all so fucked up.
[06:29.180 --> 06:32.340]  You could taste it. It made like a it was like a pineapple upside down
[06:32.340 --> 06:34.820]  cake layer of hash on the outside of the brownies.
[06:34.820 --> 06:36.220]  It was so it was tasty.
[06:36.220 --> 06:40.140]  But God, I was high to leave about 30 minutes after I left or ate that shit.
[06:40.140 --> 06:43.140]  I felt my arms drooping and I was like, I got to go home.
[06:43.540 --> 06:45.580]  Everybody went to bed. It was fun.
[06:45.580 --> 06:51.580]  Well, back in the day, that was the only way I could really utilize a Pyrex dish
[06:51.620 --> 06:53.020]  without wasting it.
[06:53.020 --> 06:55.420]  So you said back in the day, I'm going to ask a tech question now.
[06:55.420 --> 06:56.660]  What do you do now?
[06:56.660 --> 07:04.180]  Definitely do not blast into a Pyrex dish or use a Pyrex dish in our process
[07:04.180 --> 07:05.380]  anymore at all.
[07:05.380 --> 07:11.940]  Everything's closed loop and use parchment when we process it to go through the back
[07:11.940 --> 07:14.660]  of it. So there's no Pyrex dish needed now.
[07:14.740 --> 07:16.380]  Nice. Yeah. You guys taught me a way to do it.
[07:16.380 --> 07:20.300]  And there's no Pyrex dish involved in how I was taught, which is kind of neat, kind of
[07:20.300 --> 07:22.500]  smooth. These guys are fucking badass at what they do.
[07:23.820 --> 07:25.420]  So thanks for coming, you guys, by the way.
[07:25.420 --> 07:27.620]  Welcome. Thanks for having us.
[07:27.660 --> 07:29.340]  Spence was like, what are we going to talk about?
[07:29.340 --> 07:31.700]  And he kind of said, let's do a year in review.
[07:31.700 --> 07:32.980]  And I thought that would be kind of cool.
[07:33.340 --> 07:36.820]  The one thing that stood out to me is you got super fucking sick at the end of the
[07:36.820 --> 07:37.660]  year. Yeah.
[07:38.060 --> 07:40.340]  You back you like 100 percent or you ninety five.
[07:40.340 --> 07:41.900]  I'm good. You look good, bro.
[07:41.940 --> 07:43.580]  You look good. I'm getting on my way back.
[07:43.580 --> 07:47.500]  That's what I need. So I lost a bunch of weight and being skinny and losing a bunch of
[07:47.500 --> 07:48.380]  weight ain't really good.
[07:48.740 --> 07:51.780]  You looked you looked anorexic and scary skinny for a minute there.
[07:51.820 --> 07:55.900]  You had everybody worried. I think we realized in 2014 health is one of the most
[07:55.900 --> 07:57.660]  important things that we have.
[07:57.980 --> 08:01.020]  Taking care of our bodies is really.
[08:01.900 --> 08:03.780]  Sorry, weird shit happened on the computer here, but it's all right.
[08:03.820 --> 08:06.900]  We're recording. Taking care of our bodies is really important.
[08:06.940 --> 08:11.020]  And with him getting so sick now, we're trying to get him back together and get him
[08:11.020 --> 08:12.900]  healthy and gaining some more weight.
[08:13.260 --> 08:15.260]  Eating properly is one thing we've kind of.
[08:16.220 --> 08:19.860]  Clicked into doing, I've seen you guys taking great care of yourselves going to the gym
[08:19.860 --> 08:23.140]  to now. Well, this will be Spencer's first time going to the gym today.
[08:23.540 --> 08:24.540]  True.
[08:25.700 --> 08:26.700]  We'll talk about.
[08:27.900 --> 08:30.140]  Do I get them long spaghetti arms and legs?
[08:30.180 --> 08:32.860]  I know it feels I don't want to go exercise in front of anybody.
[08:33.500 --> 08:34.900]  It's planet fitness, though.
[08:34.900 --> 08:36.020]  They accept everybody.
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.980]  So and it's in our location.
[08:37.980 --> 08:39.220]  There are a lot of large people.
[08:39.260 --> 08:41.100]  So I'm sure you guys don't even look that silly.
[08:41.100 --> 08:42.220]  They're looking good.
[08:42.220 --> 08:44.580]  I'm like an Olympic athlete out there.
[08:44.620 --> 08:46.780]  They're both like, no, he's in the NBA.
[08:46.820 --> 08:47.820]  Yeah, man.
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.820]  You're the only black person around here.
[08:49.820 --> 08:53.620]  Well, if you go by the college, but they're not a black lot of black folk.
[08:53.620 --> 08:56.340]  You should wear your grill to the gym and just go hard.
[08:56.620 --> 08:57.900]  Just go hard all day.
[08:58.180 --> 08:59.620]  Stunned. I got the gym.
[09:00.140 --> 09:01.300]  You lost your grill.
[09:02.500 --> 09:04.380]  He loses on a weekly basis.
[09:04.580 --> 09:06.860]  OK, it's just it's on a different shelf for a minute.
[09:06.900 --> 09:07.940]  It's in a different pocket.
[09:09.420 --> 09:10.780]  I'm glad you're back to health, bro.
[09:10.780 --> 09:14.340]  And I forgot to mention Maddie grew my Girl Scout cookies.
[09:14.340 --> 09:17.500]  Times King Kim Grape Snopper OG cross and it looked beautiful.
[09:17.540 --> 09:19.620]  Yeah, I had two different phenos.
[09:19.620 --> 09:23.260]  I had four plants altogether, but two phenos of the same thing.
[09:23.260 --> 09:28.500]  And one got huge and the nodes were really far away.
[09:28.780 --> 09:30.420]  Totally different color.
[09:30.900 --> 09:35.340]  The smaller plant, the other pheno turned purple at the end of flower.
[09:35.820 --> 09:37.620]  But was super frosty.
[09:37.700 --> 09:39.340]  The other one wasn't as frosty, though.
[09:39.900 --> 09:41.260]  I thought I loved both of them.
[09:41.260 --> 09:42.100]  I thought you did a good job.
[09:42.100 --> 09:43.980]  I'm not sure if that thing is ever going to get to market.
[09:43.980 --> 09:46.660]  I think that might just be something that the crew around here gets to grow.
[09:46.660 --> 09:47.780]  But you did a good job with that.
[09:47.780 --> 09:49.900]  So shout out to owners say that on the show.
[09:49.900 --> 09:53.980]  All right. So for a year in review, both of you guys are involved in these questions.
[09:53.980 --> 09:56.580]  You can both have an answer. You can take turns.
[09:56.580 --> 09:59.140]  What were some of your favorite strains to grow since we're all growers in the room?
[09:59.140 --> 10:02.140]  And I might answer on some of these questions, too, since we'll do a year in review.
[10:03.300 --> 10:04.500]  Well, let's see.
[10:06.660 --> 10:11.980]  All right. I think at the beginning of the year, I was still stuck on the whole Girl Scout cookie thing.
[10:12.020 --> 10:13.940]  I was anything Girl Scout cookies.
[10:13.940 --> 10:20.300]  I was kind of running through and I still currently still have a lot of different, you know, just different unique cookie stuff.
[10:20.820 --> 10:22.420]  But I what did I grow?
[10:22.420 --> 10:28.100]  I grew that Yeti OG and that kind of put me on to the OG side of, you know, thing.
[10:28.100 --> 10:31.940]  So now I've been kind of trekking and trying to find different strains.
[10:31.940 --> 10:33.540]  Like I picked up triangle the other day.
[10:33.540 --> 10:35.740]  So that's another good one to have around.
[10:36.900 --> 10:39.980]  But I'd probably say Yeti probably is my favorite plant of the year to grow.
[10:40.020 --> 10:41.460]  Wow. That's a huge compliment.
[10:41.500 --> 10:42.540]  Yeah. Shout out to Jesse.
[10:42.540 --> 10:44.140]  I was going to say that's the one Jesse found for us.
[10:44.140 --> 10:44.900]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[10:44.900 --> 10:45.860]  And that's your favorite oil.
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.620]  And it's one of my favorite oils.
[10:47.620 --> 10:53.860]  And I was one of my follow up questions was going to be, do you prefer to grow different stuff for oil to if you're going to smoke it for flour?
[10:53.860 --> 10:54.820]  Do you grow it for yourself?
[10:54.820 --> 10:56.700]  Do you grow a different strain and then grow different for Earl?
[10:56.860 --> 11:03.580]  Um, a lot of times oil is just depending on what we have available at the time.
[11:03.620 --> 11:09.100]  So if we have certain strains that we know that are better in oil than they are in flour, we'll make oil.
[11:09.700 --> 11:16.700]  And then same like we have can of tonic right now, which we're going to split and do some oil and then some like capsules.
[11:16.700 --> 11:18.100]  So there's a little bit of mix of.
[11:18.180 --> 11:18.660]  Oh yeah.
[11:18.660 --> 11:19.660]  That's why I feel real high.
[11:19.660 --> 11:23.500]  They also gave me two, uh, two of those hash capsules right before we started the show.
[11:23.700 --> 11:26.260]  And we've done a lot of, yeah, I'm going to be pretty lit.
[11:26.380 --> 11:27.500]  I feel it in my eyes right now.
[11:27.500 --> 11:28.940]  I was like, how, why am I getting heavy?
[11:28.940 --> 11:29.620]  And then you said that.
[11:29.780 --> 11:32.540]  So can of tonic, is that the super high CBD strain?
[11:32.620 --> 11:34.020]  Um, it's not a crazy high.
[11:34.020 --> 11:35.500]  It's a good ratio.
[11:35.500 --> 11:38.940]  It's the three to one THC or CBD to THC ratio.
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.540]  So it's nice and great medicine.
[11:40.540 --> 11:41.140]  Great medicine.
[11:41.140 --> 11:41.740]  Yeah, for sure.
[11:41.780 --> 11:41.940]  Yeah.
[11:41.940 --> 11:43.660]  That'll make great medicine for people.
[11:43.900 --> 11:49.860]  Uh, are you going to take it to, do you have a specific patient in mind or a type of patient like an epileptic or someone with MS or something?
[11:50.220 --> 11:51.060]  I have a couple of people.
[11:51.060 --> 12:01.900]  I have a couple of people who are also like cancer patients that I want to try to get some stuff to and see if, you know, just, it's not going to hurt to give it a try, especially when it's, you know, you're fighting cancer.
[12:01.900 --> 12:03.420]  You might as well try all you can.
[12:03.460 --> 12:03.900]  Hell yeah.
[12:03.940 --> 12:04.380]  I agree.
[12:04.620 --> 12:05.860]  That's cool that you guys help people out.
[12:05.900 --> 12:06.300]  Oh, for sure.
[12:06.300 --> 12:10.260]  These guys came from North Carolina and set up shop in Colorado and they give away a lot of medicine.
[12:11.220 --> 12:13.900]  And for people to be able to move out from out of state and do that is really cool.
[12:13.900 --> 12:16.300]  Cause there are a lot of people that are really stingy with what they grow.
[12:16.380 --> 12:19.860]  We just love to share with other people and show people what we do.
[12:19.900 --> 12:20.140]  Yeah.
[12:20.220 --> 12:21.460]  That's why you guys are so well known.
[12:21.460 --> 12:22.900]  Cause you share and you're super kind.
[12:23.060 --> 12:23.380]  I don't know.
[12:23.380 --> 12:30.620]  I think why we moved from North Carolina is because I wanted to, when I lived in North Carolina, I wanted to tell everybody I grew weed.
[12:30.780 --> 12:33.420]  Like it was illegal, but I was like, yo, come look at this room.
[12:33.580 --> 12:35.940]  I'd crack the door open and people would be like, what the f...
[12:36.260 --> 12:37.020]  what's going on?
[12:37.100 --> 12:39.260]  People think there is a UFO in our closet or something.
[12:40.060 --> 12:43.740]  Then now when you're here, you know, there's so many people that, you know, like you, you do the same thing.
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.260]  So it's like, let me see your weed.
[12:45.660 --> 12:45.900]  Okay.
[12:45.900 --> 12:46.460]  Here's my weed.
[12:46.460 --> 12:47.060]  Here's my oil.
[12:47.060 --> 12:47.540]  You know what I'm saying?
[12:47.540 --> 12:49.580]  So it's just, you know, everything's common.
[12:49.580 --> 12:54.540]  I, one thing I do wish, I do wish the barter system with pot was a little bit better.
[12:55.380 --> 12:57.380]  Cause it would take money out of the equation.
[12:57.580 --> 12:57.820]  Yeah.
[12:57.820 --> 13:00.020]  If I could just go to the restaurant and pay for it in an eighth.
[13:00.140 --> 13:01.500]  I know a couple of places you can do that.
[13:02.020 --> 13:04.940]  You'll have to hook me up cause we're about to dinner one night here.
[13:04.940 --> 13:09.020]  Cause you know, Maddie, what was your, some, some of your favorite shit to grow this year?
[13:09.660 --> 13:10.900]  Definitely.
[13:10.940 --> 13:18.580]  I don't know who it's from, but there was a New York city Di Sulfino we had, and it tastes like, and smells like red wine.
[13:18.940 --> 13:28.620]  And we had put it in this big circle jar and all of our friends, including me, would just literally stick their faces in it for hours and just talk about it.
[13:28.820 --> 13:29.780]  It was insane.
[13:29.780 --> 13:32.300]  And then the oil from it was even crazier.
[13:32.660 --> 13:34.460]  It just had such a potent flavor.
[13:34.460 --> 13:39.260]  It was almost, you had to mix it with something else to kind of dial it down a little bit.
[13:39.540 --> 13:43.900]  And then definitely at the end of the year, one of my last favorites is a tangerine Hayes times the white.
[13:43.940 --> 13:44.180]  Yeah.
[13:44.180 --> 13:48.980]  I just found out that I have two packages of that in my little vault and that shit is going to be ran.
[13:49.020 --> 13:52.340]  Oh, you're looking at me like, well, let's, you run it and give me clones of the keeper.
[13:52.380 --> 13:56.980]  Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a process where we didn't know what we were doing with our garden.
[13:56.980 --> 13:58.860]  Or if we were relocating.
[13:59.140 --> 14:07.140]  So I decided not to take clones of it, which was a huge mistake because I had a Fino that was heavier in the white and had a really good flavor to it.
[14:07.620 --> 14:11.940]  Um, the oil of course is amazing.
[14:11.940 --> 14:13.820]  Tangerine oil tastes crazy.
[14:13.820 --> 14:14.220]  Yeah.
[14:14.300 --> 14:16.620]  She gave me a couple of dabs of this tangerine oil.
[14:16.820 --> 14:18.500]  So I'll give you, I've got two packs of seeds.
[14:18.500 --> 14:19.980]  I'll give you a pack, maybe both of them.
[14:20.260 --> 14:24.940]  You run them and you find that tangerine Fino and then you give me a clone of it and then that'll be a good trade.
[14:24.980 --> 14:26.220]  I'll take a keeper out of that shit.
[14:26.300 --> 14:26.580]  Okay.
[14:26.780 --> 14:28.180]  The nice tangerine flavored one.
[14:28.180 --> 14:30.420]  And then maybe I'll breed to that tangerine flavored female.
[14:30.740 --> 14:31.620]  I'm so glad you said that.
[14:31.620 --> 14:33.260]  Cause that was definitely one of my favorite strains.
[14:33.260 --> 14:35.180]  That's from a down with dirt seeds.
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.100]  Shout out Riley.
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.060]  That's a great strain, bro.
[14:37.100 --> 14:37.860]  Good selection.
[14:38.500 --> 14:40.580]  Uh, usually if you breed to the white, it either comes out.
[14:41.100 --> 14:44.300]  Nothing like you don't get any flavor or you get all that dank.
[14:44.300 --> 14:55.260]  And I had, yeah, like I said, I had one Fino that came out a really strong white flavor and the tangerine was still there, but it was definitely a back note to it, which was nice.
[14:55.860 --> 14:57.900]  Whatever you were giving me dabs of was delicious.
[14:58.100 --> 14:58.540]  For sure.
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.180]  I was like, y'all got some more of those dabs.
[15:00.220 --> 15:01.380]  And you're like, bye Felicia.
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.340]  We don't really have any left at all.
[15:03.340 --> 15:04.140]  And it's sad.
[15:04.380 --> 15:06.340]  I'm conserving the good dabs go away quickly.
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.140]  I've been trying to conserve what I made and it's hard.
[15:09.580 --> 15:11.460]  I just want to dab the shit out of my dabs all day.
[15:11.500 --> 15:12.340]  We're going to have to take a dab here.
[15:12.340 --> 15:14.220]  We keep saying the D word so many times.
[15:14.420 --> 15:15.300]  What do you want to take a dab of?
[15:15.500 --> 15:15.940]  Oh shit.
[15:15.940 --> 15:17.140]  The Yeti OG over here.
[15:17.140 --> 15:17.620]  What do you got?
[15:18.020 --> 15:21.860]  Uh, I've got a little bit of live that I got from my good friend Spence a while back.
[15:21.860 --> 15:22.900]  It's the gorilla Hayes.
[15:22.940 --> 15:25.860]  And then I've also got some, uh, some of the shatter that I made.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.180]  That's parchment paper.
[15:28.180 --> 15:31.340]  Y'all imagine the size of parchment that it takes to make that sound.
[15:31.340 --> 15:32.380]  You guys listeners.
[15:33.660 --> 15:33.820]  Yeah.
[15:33.820 --> 15:37.220]  That's a nice piece of, uh, yeah, here you got that out.
[15:37.220 --> 15:37.740]  Give me a dab.
[15:38.980 --> 15:39.420]  There you go.
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.220]  Nicely medicated, highly educated.
[15:41.980 --> 15:44.660]  Uh, my next question that I want to talk about for the year, I might
[15:44.660 --> 15:45.700]  mention a couple of strains.
[15:45.900 --> 15:47.300]  I don't even want to talk about my own strains.
[15:47.300 --> 15:50.260]  I should, but that feels, uh, the lemon Jeffrey.
[15:51.140 --> 15:53.980]  Well, something that, did you grow anything that you, there's a few
[15:53.980 --> 15:56.620]  strains you grew this year that you don't that white widow that
[15:56.620 --> 15:58.420]  I got from Spence was amazing.
[15:59.580 --> 16:02.140]  I like the platinum emoji is pretty unique.
[16:02.220 --> 16:04.300]  There's some of it over there in a jar curing still.
[16:04.300 --> 16:07.220]  And I took a bunch of that to the string cheese shows and when I would light it,
[16:07.220 --> 16:10.980]  the people around me would be like, yeah, that one for sure.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.660]  The glue came around.
[16:12.660 --> 16:14.820]  I think everybody's impressed with what it does.
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.260]  Yeah.
[16:15.260 --> 16:16.660]  I want to grow that again.
[16:16.700 --> 16:18.820]  Uh, I took cuts to grow it again a couple more times.
[16:18.820 --> 16:21.500]  Cause I definitely want to put it in a bigger pot and give it more love,
[16:21.500 --> 16:23.500]  more training, more nitrogen guys.
[16:23.780 --> 16:27.340]  Uh, if you grow the gorilla glue, feed the shit out of that plant early.
[16:27.780 --> 16:29.100]  Like, yeah, it's hungry.
[16:29.100 --> 16:30.580]  It wants a little bit of everything.
[16:30.580 --> 16:31.460]  Just overfeed it.
[16:31.460 --> 16:33.820]  If you think you're going to fuck it up in week four, feed it more.
[16:33.940 --> 16:34.700]  Just feed it more.
[16:34.740 --> 16:35.700]  It should be okay.
[16:36.100 --> 16:36.740]  I'm going to take a dab.
[16:36.740 --> 16:37.660]  Somebody's got to say something.
[16:37.660 --> 16:38.660]  So I'll ask a question.
[16:39.100 --> 16:42.220]  Uh, what were some of your biggest growing evolutions?
[16:42.220 --> 16:45.220]  And one of my favorites is lemon Jeffrey, the white widow and the gorilla glue.
[16:45.220 --> 16:46.860]  I guess we'll settle on those and the Yeti.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.300]  Of course.
[16:47.460 --> 16:51.220]  Uh, what was some of your favorite, uh, biggest growing evolutions that you guys
[16:51.220 --> 16:52.780]  made at the garden of Whedon this year?
[16:52.780 --> 16:54.580]  And I kind of know what you're going to say, and I'm going to give a shout
[16:54.580 --> 16:55.700]  out to somebody after you do it.
[16:56.380 --> 16:57.300]  Oh, damn.
[16:57.300 --> 16:58.420]  I don't know what you want to say.
[16:58.420 --> 16:59.020]  Shit.
[16:59.260 --> 16:59.660]  That's cool.
[16:59.660 --> 17:00.620]  The cage thing.
[17:00.900 --> 17:03.260]  Oh, well, yeah, we kind of changed.
[17:03.300 --> 17:07.420]  Well, with, you know, stuff changing and like regulation and laws and stuff like
[17:07.420 --> 17:09.380]  that, you kind of got to change with the game.
[17:09.380 --> 17:14.460]  So now we're kind of, instead of doing a room full of multiple plants, we're doing
[17:15.020 --> 17:19.300]  less plants, same space, but just bigger, longer veg plants.
[17:19.900 --> 17:23.260]  So we really get to take care of a lot of, you know, get to spend more time with
[17:23.260 --> 17:27.060]  each plant, work on canopy management, you know, stuff like that.
[17:28.140 --> 17:30.780]  So shout out to green works.
[17:30.780 --> 17:32.140]  Check it out right there on my paper brush.
[17:32.140 --> 17:33.260]  Shout out to green works.
[17:33.260 --> 17:35.300]  Cause I knew that's where this conversation was headed.
[17:35.300 --> 17:42.460]  They have, um, really set up a awesome plan for their grow and a lot of people
[17:42.460 --> 17:46.660]  are catching on to what they're doing because with the plant count now we have
[17:46.660 --> 17:50.220]  to do something, um, so bigger is better.
[17:50.340 --> 17:50.660]  Yeah.
[17:50.780 --> 17:53.740]  As a breeder, it's scary to see these plant count limitations come in, but
[17:53.940 --> 17:55.460]  luckily I just teamed up with the spot.
[17:55.460 --> 17:56.300]  Shout out to the spot.
[17:56.300 --> 17:58.340]  So I'll get to do some breeding in there.
[17:59.380 --> 18:02.860]  So those are those cages pretty much, um, your biggest evolution of growing.
[18:03.300 --> 18:03.620]  Yeah.
[18:03.700 --> 18:05.140]  Um, I mean, we kind of learn.
[18:05.300 --> 18:06.540]  You did a lot of tea stuff.
[18:06.580 --> 18:07.780]  Uh, you advanced your teas.
[18:07.780 --> 18:09.060]  I saw the alfalfa sprouts.
[18:09.060 --> 18:09.980]  I saw some shit like that.
[18:09.980 --> 18:10.260]  Happened.
[18:10.260 --> 18:10.780]  I did.
[18:10.900 --> 18:11.780]  What did we do this year?
[18:12.740 --> 18:18.980]  The barley straw that has like natural barley straw, barley seeds and it grows.
[18:19.020 --> 18:22.540]  Um, we did a lot of stuff with, uh,
[18:24.020 --> 18:25.900]  like, uh, that was a big hit this year.
[18:25.980 --> 18:27.460]  A lot of girl, Kashi's big hit.
[18:27.500 --> 18:32.500]  Um, and then just kind of going back a lot of going back to the basics
[18:32.500 --> 18:35.940]  and the Govitas and then everybody went to Christ and Govitas and
[18:35.940 --> 18:36.980]  Nanolases, right?
[18:37.620 --> 18:38.060]  Yeah.
[18:38.300 --> 18:40.540]  Um, I've been talking about the light that Jesse gave me.
[18:40.540 --> 18:41.820]  I might not even be able to run it.
[18:41.820 --> 18:42.300]  You guys.
[18:42.620 --> 18:45.420]  Uh, my grow room's got like a seven foot ceiling.
[18:45.740 --> 18:48.260]  I grow my plants to usually five and a half feet tall.
[18:48.260 --> 18:51.380]  And I've been told that you got to keep the plants three feet from those
[18:51.380 --> 18:52.820]  lights or you'll burn them.
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.380]  I mean, I don't know.
[18:55.780 --> 18:57.220]  I don't want to say you will burn them.
[18:57.220 --> 19:00.900]  Cause there's probably a couple of strains that could grow closer than three
[19:00.900 --> 19:05.180]  feet, but I just think that it would definitely stresses them out.
[19:05.180 --> 19:07.660]  It's just too much spectrum and too much.
[19:08.460 --> 19:09.180]  Man, that does.
[19:09.300 --> 19:12.780]  If you've never been under Govitas or anything like that, you'll, you
[19:12.780 --> 19:14.060]  know how powerful they are.
[19:14.060 --> 19:14.460]  The spot.
[19:14.460 --> 19:15.940]  They just hired me at the spot.
[19:15.940 --> 19:20.980]  There's a 227 Govitas and they turn on a small portion and it's like, yeah,
[19:20.980 --> 19:22.180]  you, it's like you just woke up.
[19:22.220 --> 19:23.020]  Oh shit.
[19:23.020 --> 19:23.540]  Come on.
[19:24.380 --> 19:27.020]  Are they about to buy you a Method 7?
[19:27.020 --> 19:27.820]  What's up Method 7?
[19:27.820 --> 19:29.580]  If you guys are listening, I could use a sponsorship.
[19:29.580 --> 19:30.780]  Are they about to buy you at the spot?
[19:30.780 --> 19:30.900]  Yeah.
[19:30.900 --> 19:31.100]  Yeah.
[19:31.100 --> 19:33.660]  They said they would, but I mean, still if I can get them on the, on the
[19:33.660 --> 19:35.660]  DL from the discount or something.
[19:35.660 --> 19:36.940]  Oh, I'm trying to cop a pair.
[19:38.660 --> 19:40.900]  Actually a Harvest Honey, hit up Harvest Honey.
[19:40.900 --> 19:41.500]  She'll help you out.
[19:41.540 --> 19:42.300]  Sorry, Harvest Honey.
[19:42.300 --> 19:43.380]  I don't mean to bust you out on the show.
[19:43.660 --> 19:46.100]  Actually I do because she's trying to be Miss High Times.
[19:46.100 --> 19:46.980]  So check her out.
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.620]  That's why I don't say vote for her, but check her out.
[19:48.620 --> 19:49.220]  Give her a good run.
[19:49.820 --> 19:50.780]  Uh, do what you think.
[19:51.420 --> 19:52.260]  Uh, where the fuck was I?
[19:52.260 --> 19:53.180]  Shout out to Greenworks.
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.140]  Follow those guys.
[19:54.140 --> 19:55.940]  Is it just at Greenworks on Instagram?
[19:56.380 --> 19:57.100]  Something like that.
[19:57.100 --> 19:58.180]  He's going to search right quick.
[19:58.380 --> 20:02.860]  Uh, they're the guys that kind of inspired the, uh, idea for Spence's cages.
[20:03.020 --> 20:04.580]  Single plant scrogs.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.300]  Single plant.
[20:06.300 --> 20:06.500]  Yeah.
[20:06.500 --> 20:08.540]  Single plant scrogs in gigantic containers.
[20:08.580 --> 20:10.220]  But did you tell them how we switched ours up?
[20:10.900 --> 20:12.260]  I mean, yeah, ours are mine.
[20:12.500 --> 20:13.660]  People have seen pictures.
[20:13.660 --> 20:14.500]  I don't have to tell you.
[20:14.500 --> 20:17.300]  Check out Garden of Weeden on Instagram instead of just, instead of using the big
[20:17.300 --> 20:20.140]  squares, I don't want to copy my man shit from to the team.
[20:20.140 --> 20:21.580]  We switched ours up just a little bit.
[20:21.580 --> 20:22.540]  It had to be a little bit different.
[20:22.540 --> 20:24.180]  You gotta do your own OG status.
[20:24.260 --> 20:24.540]  Yeah.
[20:24.660 --> 20:25.620]  Gotta do what you're doing.
[20:25.620 --> 20:28.300]  Shout out to the plug on the, on the scrogs there.
[20:30.060 --> 20:33.860]  It is green underscore works underscore.
[20:34.100 --> 20:34.260]  Yeah.
[20:34.260 --> 20:34.740]  Check them out on Instagram.
[20:35.660 --> 20:37.020]  They have an awesome feed.
[20:37.340 --> 20:37.700]  Yeah.
[20:37.820 --> 20:39.700]  And make sure you follow Garden of Weeden.
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.500]  Don't follow one of the fake Garden of Weeden's.
[20:41.500 --> 20:42.900]  Look for pictures of these folks.
[20:44.180 --> 20:44.460]  Yeah.
[20:44.460 --> 20:45.060]  Don't do that.
[20:45.180 --> 20:45.460]  Yeah.
[20:45.460 --> 20:46.420]  Don't follow the bunk one.
[20:46.420 --> 20:49.700]  There's a couple of the bunk Garden of Weeden's and they always send me messages
[20:49.700 --> 20:53.780]  and shit and I don't reply because I don't want to be a hater, so I just ignore it.
[20:54.020 --> 20:58.660]  But make sure that you find a picture of, uh, it's Spence's a six foot, six foot,
[20:58.660 --> 21:01.260]  four, six foot five black guy with a beard and dreadlocks.
[21:01.260 --> 21:04.020]  I mean, if there's not pictures of that dude on there, don't follow that one.
[21:04.020 --> 21:06.020]  And then Maddie's a pretty lady and they're standing together.
[21:06.020 --> 21:07.180]  So, I mean, it's easy to spot them.
[21:07.820 --> 21:13.420]  They're probably hitting an expensive rig or taking too big of a dab in the picture.
[21:13.940 --> 21:15.340]  So we have an expensive rig.
[21:15.340 --> 21:17.100]  At least we know we worked hard for it.
[21:17.140 --> 21:17.660]  Yes.
[21:17.820 --> 21:20.500]  I'm just saying you guys are always at the, not just your own, you guys
[21:20.500 --> 21:22.060]  are all the cool events and shit.
[21:22.060 --> 21:22.180]  Yeah.
[21:22.180 --> 21:23.020]  We're so lucky.
[21:23.020 --> 21:26.340]  We have so many friends with awesome toys that we get to play with all the time.
[21:26.380 --> 21:26.660]  Yeah.
[21:26.700 --> 21:29.940]  This industry is so great when you make friends in this community slash industry.
[21:30.420 --> 21:32.340]  You get to hit so many cool rigs and smoke so much.
[21:32.460 --> 21:34.420]  Where's your little master shake?
[21:34.460 --> 21:34.860]  Yeah.
[21:34.940 --> 21:36.340]  Uh, he's up on the shelf.
[21:36.380 --> 21:36.980]  Maybe later.
[21:37.140 --> 21:37.420]  Yeah.
[21:38.180 --> 21:40.100]  That that's a good, uh, competition there.
[21:40.100 --> 21:42.300]  Master shake against the rig that Spence brought over.
[21:43.100 --> 21:44.260]  Uh, who made that rig you brought?
[21:47.220 --> 21:49.300]  I don't know his name, but it's BC glass.
[21:49.820 --> 21:53.340]  I, uh, with a quave club, Brian something.
[21:53.340 --> 21:53.500]  Yeah.
[21:53.500 --> 21:56.500]  With a banger on it and this motherfucker.
[21:56.780 --> 21:57.180]  Yeah.
[21:57.220 --> 21:59.500]  That thing kicks you right in the dick and smiles.
[21:59.500 --> 22:01.820]  It looks at you like, you should name it.
[22:01.820 --> 22:02.260]  Nelson.
[22:02.260 --> 22:03.380]  Is that the guy from the Simpsons?
[22:03.380 --> 22:04.020]  Is that his name?
[22:04.020 --> 22:05.100]  They should name it Nelson.
[22:05.100 --> 22:09.100]  Cause it's just like, it's you and just kicks you right in the dick and laughs.
[22:09.380 --> 22:12.020]  It's a great rig, but I'm kind of offended by the way it hit me.
[22:12.740 --> 22:17.500]  I had to look at it a second time and reconsider if I wanted to hit it again.
[22:17.540 --> 22:18.580]  Oh, I wanted to hit it again.
[22:18.580 --> 22:22.820]  I will hit it again, but God, yeah, I'll get that again.
[22:22.820 --> 22:23.380]  I ain't scared.
[22:24.020 --> 22:24.820]  Uh, all right.
[22:25.780 --> 22:28.940]  So, uh, we talked kind of about growing evolutions.
[22:28.940 --> 22:29.980]  I didn't change too much.
[22:30.020 --> 22:32.740]  I'm learning more about breeding and I learned that one of the methods I tried,
[22:32.740 --> 22:36.540]  I overdid it and I don't need to apply so damn much cause it fucked up my plants.
[22:36.940 --> 22:40.460]  Uh, I tried to, I make my own silver thiosulfate and I applied way too many
[22:40.460 --> 22:44.500]  applications and I learned that if you overdo it, it just piss plants off and
[22:44.500 --> 22:46.420]  you don't get enough pollen and it sucks.
[22:46.740 --> 22:47.820]  So that's what I learned.
[22:47.820 --> 22:48.980]  That's my growing evolution.
[22:49.220 --> 22:51.580]  Uh, who'd you guys notice this year other than green works who
[22:51.580 --> 22:53.100]  stood out in the weed community?
[22:54.340 --> 22:56.060]  You can talk about good and or bad stuff.
[22:56.060 --> 22:56.940]  Cause you covered your face.
[22:56.940 --> 22:59.380]  Like you fucking were like, well, all right.
[22:59.740 --> 23:03.180]  Um, man, let's see.
[23:03.180 --> 23:07.540]  I'll give a shout out to like all the people that are, you know, not necessarily
[23:07.540 --> 23:12.020]  going away from bottle nutrients, but people who are, you know, expanding
[23:12.620 --> 23:14.900]  their grow game into biologicals.
[23:15.540 --> 23:19.620]  Um, I was actually just in Denver on Monday and I got to meet
[23:19.620 --> 23:21.180]  up with the Michael fusion guys.
[23:21.180 --> 23:22.900]  I got some bags of Michael fusion for you.
[23:22.940 --> 23:23.500]  Nice.
[23:23.900 --> 23:24.780]  Shit rocks.
[23:24.820 --> 23:26.940]  Um, and then shout out to the mills guys.
[23:27.060 --> 23:29.060]  Um, always hooking me up when I see him.
[23:29.700 --> 23:30.820]  Mills pays the bills.
[23:31.100 --> 23:31.600]  Yes.
[23:32.180 --> 23:33.140]  I've never used mills.
[23:33.420 --> 23:33.920]  Never have.
[23:35.140 --> 23:35.340]  Yeah.
[23:35.340 --> 23:38.500]  You look like you're just started and honestly, we're really impressed so far.
[23:38.500 --> 23:39.620]  Didn't you use it back in the day too?
[23:39.620 --> 23:40.120]  One time?
[23:40.740 --> 23:42.500]  No, I used, what was that stuff?
[23:42.540 --> 23:44.020]  One of your homies used it on Instagram.
[23:44.020 --> 23:46.660]  I think I used to follow somebody that talked about mills, bills.
[23:47.180 --> 23:49.140]  When people are still talking about it.
[23:49.140 --> 23:50.740]  So it's doing something right.
[23:50.780 --> 23:54.020]  I have a friend in Seattle that started using it and she
[23:54.020 --> 23:55.580]  raved about it for outdoor.
[23:55.580 --> 23:57.180]  Her plants were beautiful too.
[23:57.500 --> 23:59.100]  And she is all about mills.
[23:59.100 --> 24:02.700]  So when he started talking about it, well, I talked to her a lot of bit about it.
[24:02.700 --> 24:03.940]  And she said that it was a good idea.
[24:03.940 --> 24:06.580]  So we went ahead and got samples.
[24:06.580 --> 24:10.860]  And then when we met him and we, they teamed up with Michael fusion,
[24:11.540 --> 24:13.140]  they're doing something together now.
[24:13.140 --> 24:13.640]  Yeah.
[24:16.100 --> 24:17.700]  Their line is now teamed up.
[24:17.700 --> 24:22.180]  So they have their whole feeding chart with the Michael fusion mixed in also.
[24:23.100 --> 24:25.060]  One of these days soon, we're going to make a field trip, bro.
[24:25.060 --> 24:27.100]  It's going to be Spence and Jesse and myself and Maddie.
[24:27.100 --> 24:28.100]  You can come to, if you want.
[24:28.540 --> 24:31.740]  Uh, we're going to go to the worm company in Springs, the Rocky
[24:31.740 --> 24:34.820]  mountain worm company, and go visit Jay and stock up on some organics.
[24:34.820 --> 24:36.660]  Get some worms, get some worm poop.
[24:38.060 --> 24:38.300]  Wow.
[24:38.300 --> 24:38.940]  What was that?
[24:38.940 --> 24:40.660]  Something I was about to cross somebody out.
[24:43.460 --> 24:45.820]  He's playing basketball in my bat in my kitchen.
[24:46.220 --> 24:46.720]  All right.
[24:46.980 --> 24:49.820]  Um, so all the, all the organic growers, like probiotics, farmers,
[24:49.820 --> 24:51.860]  Alliance, those types of guys that were, who shot, who were
[24:51.860 --> 24:52.820]  shouting out for who we noticed.
[24:52.820 --> 24:53.060]  All right.
[24:53.060 --> 24:53.560]  That's cool.
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.000]  I also noticed, uh, on a lot in Colorado this year, miss green thumb.
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.440]  I don't know her personally.
[25:00.480 --> 25:00.680]  Yeah.
[25:00.680 --> 25:02.920]  We haven't met her yet, but we haven't met her yet.
[25:03.280 --> 25:06.120]  She local people, they won the Amsterdam.
[25:06.160 --> 25:06.360]  Yeah.
[25:06.360 --> 25:08.280]  I met Jess, uh, shout out Jess, miss green thumb.
[25:08.280 --> 25:09.560]  I met her one time on accident.
[25:09.560 --> 25:12.560]  I, uh, bought a beer rig and I had, you know, the purple one.
[25:12.560 --> 25:13.200]  I had it sitting there.
[25:13.200 --> 25:13.680]  I love it.
[25:13.720 --> 25:16.560]  She was sitting across the table dabbing and I had my shirt on and she
[25:16.560 --> 25:17.960]  complimented it and I was like, you want to hit it?
[25:17.960 --> 25:18.560]  And she's like, yeah.
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.360]  And then she goes, you're, you're that guy.
[25:20.360 --> 25:21.080]  And I was like, I am.
[25:21.080 --> 25:22.520]  Cause she recognized me from Instagram.
[25:22.560 --> 25:24.240]  So, uh, yeah, we, yes.
[25:24.240 --> 25:24.680]  Awesome.
[25:24.680 --> 25:27.040]  Is everybody at the secret cup?
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.200]  A lot of people had ran her, her, yeah.
[25:31.200 --> 25:32.520]  I was looking for what it was.
[25:32.600 --> 25:34.600]  Guys, check out miss green thumb on Instagram and check out
[25:34.600 --> 25:35.480]  her Kong on her feet.
[25:35.480 --> 25:36.080]  So awesome.
[25:36.080 --> 25:38.960]  When everyone's saying compliments to the grower, miss green thumb, and she
[25:38.960 --> 25:42.520]  got a lot of recognition for her, for her work this year.
[25:42.520 --> 25:43.800]  So compliments to her.
[25:43.880 --> 25:44.240]  Yeah.
[25:44.400 --> 25:44.600]  Yeah.
[25:44.600 --> 25:47.360]  She grew arms the size of my arm, our buds, the size of my arms.
[25:47.480 --> 25:47.880]  For sure.
[25:47.880 --> 25:48.440]  They were long.
[25:48.520 --> 25:48.840]  Yeah.
[25:49.120 --> 25:49.520]  Yeah.
[25:49.800 --> 25:53.480]  Uh, you and her are probably some of the, are the two, uh, best
[25:53.480 --> 25:54.600]  female growers that I know.
[25:55.240 --> 25:56.440]  That's a hell of a compliment.
[25:56.440 --> 25:57.320]  I appreciate that.
[25:58.200 --> 25:58.600]  For sure.
[25:58.640 --> 26:00.360]  Maybe we can get her on the podcast one day.
[26:00.600 --> 26:00.920]  Yeah.
[26:00.960 --> 26:02.160]  I've told her she can come.
[26:02.520 --> 26:04.640]  I've told her so people live in Denver and shit.
[26:04.640 --> 26:06.800]  They don't want to drive down to this town to be on a podcast.
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.560]  Number one, the dangerous city in Colorado.
[26:11.800 --> 26:14.240]  It's probably been like fucking 10 years in a row.
[26:14.240 --> 26:18.240]  That's so frustrating though, because it's not like every day.
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.280]  There's just violent crimes, right?
[26:20.280 --> 26:21.840]  It's just because of the population.
[26:21.920 --> 26:24.760]  Until the people that other people are around.
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.560]  It's just the population.
[26:26.560 --> 26:26.920]  It's all.
[26:27.360 --> 26:27.640]  I don't know.
[26:27.640 --> 26:30.280]  I mind my own business and I don't have any problems.
[26:30.360 --> 26:31.400]  I do my own thing.
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.040]  Do my own thing.
[26:33.120 --> 26:33.600]  All right.
[26:33.920 --> 26:37.360]  So, uh, I guess since we're talking about fucking the town and stuff that we see,
[26:37.360 --> 26:40.720]  here's a great question after seeing it's been a full year of legalization, like a
[26:40.720 --> 26:44.040]  year and five days now, since we've legalized, uh, recreational adult use
[26:44.040 --> 26:45.520]  cannabis in the state of Colorado.
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.960]  Uh, I remember the moment that you could buy a weed at a store in Colorado, but,
[26:51.280 --> 26:54.040]  uh, like after this full year, how do you feel about it?
[26:54.040 --> 26:54.720]  And what have you seen?
[26:55.600 --> 26:56.680]  Does it make a difference?
[26:57.600 --> 26:58.200]  Yes.
[26:58.200 --> 26:59.640]  You guys are from a whole nother state.
[26:59.640 --> 27:00.040]  I don't know.
[27:00.240 --> 27:00.800]  It's.
[27:02.240 --> 27:03.280]  It's legal.
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.160]  So they have to regulate it.
[27:05.200 --> 27:05.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[27:05.920 --> 27:12.480]  And some of the regulations are shitty, but it's stuff that has to be done.
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.000]  If the whole, you know, if the country wants to use Colorado or Washington as an
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.440]  example to go legal across the board, they're going to have to be, it's going to
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.680]  have to be regulated like it, if it wants to be everywhere.
[27:26.680 --> 27:28.720]  So eventually like it's going to happen.
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.280]  It sucks for small people like myself who are small business mom and pop trying to
[27:35.280 --> 27:37.200]  be small business and kind of got squished.
[27:37.240 --> 27:39.560]  Always remember, go to the mom and pops.
[27:39.840 --> 27:40.280]  Yeah.
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.160]  You always find better stuff there.
[27:42.360 --> 27:45.560]  And you will the big store for sure.
[27:45.880 --> 27:46.040]  Yeah.
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.240]  Check the spot first.
[27:47.520 --> 27:48.040]  The spot.
[27:49.680 --> 27:50.760]  Shout out to the spot.
[27:51.360 --> 27:52.440]  I got to do what I got to do.
[27:53.440 --> 27:56.200]  Uh, all right, Maddie, what did you notice over the last year?
[27:56.920 --> 28:02.680]  So many people from out of state are flooding into Colorado and you know, we,
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.360]  I, you know, I can't say anything negative about that at all.
[28:06.400 --> 28:07.840]  Because I moved here two years ago.
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.600]  No, you're not being hateful.
[28:08.600 --> 28:09.200]  You're just noticing.
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.160]  February two years.
[28:10.240 --> 28:10.720]  And you know what?
[28:11.160 --> 28:12.760]  A lot of people are from North Carolina.
[28:12.800 --> 28:14.880]  It's North Carolina and Texas that have moved here.
[28:15.880 --> 28:16.200]  Yeah.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.400]  And also that's another thing.
[28:17.400 --> 28:18.400]  That's just because you know us.
[28:18.400 --> 28:21.560]  That's the only reason North Carolina is because we are all from there.
[28:21.640 --> 28:21.800]  Yeah.
[28:21.800 --> 28:23.760]  And you brought the town of Dixie with you.
[28:23.840 --> 28:24.160]  Yeah.
[28:24.320 --> 28:25.560]  Like Dixie is empty now.
[28:25.600 --> 28:28.600]  Like there's just dust and fucking tumbleweeds in Dixie.
[28:28.600 --> 28:29.520]  Cause y'all left.
[28:30.440 --> 28:30.960]  Truly.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.720]  And all of our friends though, learned how to grow amazing weed this year.
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.960]  All of our friends really caught on quickly and learned a lot from, from us
[28:38.960 --> 28:45.760]  and also yourself and Instagram is not only a social network, a great media to
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.680]  learn a lot, your guys's table at the shit, the new and the old house as part
[28:50.680 --> 28:54.240]  of what started me thinking about, I should do something because I would go
[28:54.240 --> 28:57.880]  to your place and guys at Spence and Maddie's old place and the new place.
[28:57.880 --> 29:00.720]  But people would fly from North Carolina and come visit these guys
[29:00.720 --> 29:02.000]  and just hang out for the weekend.
[29:02.240 --> 29:05.240]  And when I would show up to come dab them out and kind of maybe give them
[29:05.240 --> 29:09.560]  some ivory seeds and a t-shirt and some stickers for visiting and maybe a hat pin.
[29:09.920 --> 29:13.600]  Uh, they would start asking weed questions and no shit.
[29:13.640 --> 29:17.600]  10 guys came and nine of them asked the same exact first three questions.
[29:17.920 --> 29:21.400]  And I was like, I should just record this somewhere and play it back at them.
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.000]  Like, here is my answer, like an automated weed service or some shit.
[29:25.560 --> 29:29.280]  Uh, but I got good at talking to people at the table and talking
[29:29.280 --> 29:30.680]  about growing weed like that.
[29:30.680 --> 29:33.120]  And so your guys's table kind of opened this up a little bit.
[29:33.720 --> 29:34.120]  Word.
[29:34.240 --> 29:35.000]  And now you're here.
[29:35.000 --> 29:35.840]  So that's kind of silly.
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.920]  Our, our table is a hot topic because we're always just taking dabs and talking
[29:41.920 --> 29:43.680]  about different growing subjects.
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.600]  And there's always so many different people there.
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.400]  It's always a different conversation.
[29:47.400 --> 29:48.520]  There's always something to learn.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.320]  Such a crazy mix of people.
[29:50.800 --> 29:54.640]  Black guy, white guy, Persian girl.
[29:57.280 --> 29:59.280]  Syrian, whatever, dude.
[29:59.280 --> 30:00.520]  I still got to watch out for it.
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.240]  Threw a dart at that part of the map and I missed trying to
[30:03.240 --> 30:04.360]  figure out where I was aiming for.
[30:05.240 --> 30:08.600]  Uh, and then there's an Asian guy from his Vietnamese dude.
[30:08.680 --> 30:12.880]  Then he got a couple of white dudes, a couple of chihuahuas, a couple of chihuahuas.
[30:13.080 --> 30:14.640]  People that I can't even tell what they are.
[30:15.000 --> 30:15.960]  Am I wook ass?
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.360]  It's a nice mix of people over there.
[30:17.520 --> 30:17.840]  Yeah.
[30:17.840 --> 30:21.640]  People just flood in when there's legal weed.
[30:21.640 --> 30:22.800]  Why wouldn't you?
[30:22.800 --> 30:27.840]  We, we come from a place where you can't have more than a gram on you
[30:27.840 --> 30:30.120]  without, without possibly going to jail.
[30:30.360 --> 30:33.800]  Well, you get a citation, like if it's under an eighth or half
[30:33.800 --> 30:34.640]  eighth or something like that.
[30:35.160 --> 30:40.040]  Don't quote me, but if it's more, you have the possibility of going to jail.
[30:40.040 --> 30:43.600]  That's still, that's still real in places here.
[30:43.640 --> 30:44.760]  I'm so free.
[30:44.840 --> 30:48.160]  We're going home at the end of the month and so most nerve wracking
[30:48.360 --> 30:51.000]  because we can't be ourselves there.
[30:51.520 --> 30:51.720]  Yeah.
[30:51.760 --> 30:52.880]  We're so used to Colorado.
[30:52.880 --> 30:55.160]  Everything's so easy going and free here.
[30:55.480 --> 30:56.440]  I'm staying inside.
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.280]  Yeah.
[30:59.640 --> 30:59.800]  Yeah.
[30:59.800 --> 31:00.280]  That's smart.
[31:00.360 --> 31:00.920]  That's smart.
[31:01.280 --> 31:01.440]  Yeah.
[31:01.920 --> 31:05.640]  I forget that we're still supposed to, people forget that there's an open
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.320]  container law that applies to cannabis here.
[31:07.320 --> 31:10.440]  You're supposed to have your weed in a container that's sealed up and out of
[31:10.440 --> 31:13.640]  your reach, like in, it's probably supposed to be in the trunk, honestly,
[31:13.640 --> 31:17.240]  I put mine, I've got an SUV, so my trunk, I can reach the trunk in my car.
[31:17.240 --> 31:18.120]  I can reach everything.
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.960]  I'm fucking six, five and I have an SUV.
[31:19.960 --> 31:20.600]  Longest arms ever.
[31:20.600 --> 31:21.760]  It's an unfair advantage.
[31:21.760 --> 31:22.040]  Yeah.
[31:22.040 --> 31:26.200]  So no matter where I put it, so I put it in the backpack, in a container and my
[31:26.200 --> 31:30.840]  dabs are always out of reach and in the backseat, I mean, that's how I roll.
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.520]  Sometimes there may have been car dabs.
[31:39.420 --> 31:43.700]  I wanted to be a smart ass, but I wanted to be a smart ass and ask why he had to
[31:43.700 --> 31:46.300]  know what time it was, but none of my jokes are going to be appropriate.
[31:46.860 --> 31:50.540]  Uh, oh, you're going to get swole up tonight.
[31:50.820 --> 31:51.260]  Nice.
[31:51.260 --> 31:52.580]  Get blazed and then go work out.
[31:52.580 --> 31:54.060]  Is shit heavier when you're high though?
[31:54.700 --> 31:56.540]  I ain't going to lift too much today.
[31:56.780 --> 31:57.140]  All right.
[31:58.740 --> 31:59.220]  What are you?
[31:59.220 --> 32:00.260]  Did you know what you're going to do?
[32:00.660 --> 32:02.060]  I'm going to try to run a mile.
[32:03.060 --> 32:05.100]  Oh, about 30 minutes later.
[32:05.100 --> 32:05.700]  What are you going to do?
[32:05.700 --> 32:07.540]  Quit smoking cigarettes this year.
[32:07.740 --> 32:09.540]  Oh, that's a good, good change for the year.
[32:09.540 --> 32:11.500]  Team Whedon all quit smoking cigarettes.
[32:11.500 --> 32:11.620]  Yeah.
[32:11.620 --> 32:14.460]  I noticed that when everybody got sick, everybody got like deathly
[32:14.460 --> 32:15.500]  ill at the end of the year.
[32:15.500 --> 32:17.140]  And then you guys all were like, fuck cigarettes.
[32:17.140 --> 32:18.140]  And then he came back strong.
[32:18.140 --> 32:18.700]  So that's good.
[32:18.700 --> 32:19.500]  Congrats on that.
[32:19.540 --> 32:20.300]  I'm proud of you guys.
[32:20.340 --> 32:21.220]  Yeah, for sure.
[32:21.220 --> 32:22.580]  That was a big accomplishment.
[32:22.620 --> 32:24.860]  Definitely dabs taste completely different.
[32:24.860 --> 32:27.980]  Once you get your, once you get your full palate back.
[32:28.700 --> 32:30.420]  I still haven't gotten mine full one back.
[32:30.420 --> 32:31.140]  I don't think.
[32:31.340 --> 32:33.260]  So that means I used to smoke Newport's.
[32:33.500 --> 32:36.020]  I don't know if it'll come back within like two years.
[32:36.020 --> 32:37.220]  I'll shout out to Newport, right?
[32:37.220 --> 32:39.220]  They got me through some years, right?
[32:39.300 --> 32:40.660]  Through some stressful times.
[32:41.420 --> 32:42.580]  My life is hard.
[32:44.340 --> 32:46.540]  You're the only black person in this town and shit.
[32:47.220 --> 32:48.260]  Shit is hard.
[32:48.780 --> 32:50.580]  You know what we didn't see after legalization?
[32:51.260 --> 32:54.100]  A whole bunch of crime, a whole bunch of murder, a whole bunch of rape, a whole
[32:54.100 --> 32:56.940]  bunch of little kids running around, smoking spliffs, a whole bunch of people
[32:56.940 --> 32:58.580]  walking in the park, just getting high.
[32:59.180 --> 33:00.740]  It's everyone's happy.
[33:00.740 --> 33:01.340]  Yeah.
[33:02.220 --> 33:02.580]  Yeah.
[33:02.580 --> 33:03.500]  Cause yeah.
[33:03.620 --> 33:06.580]  What is there to fight over when it's legal?
[33:07.260 --> 33:07.900]  It is.
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.500]  It's like the no brainer.
[33:09.820 --> 33:12.740]  I just don't understand why other States don't follow.
[33:13.260 --> 33:16.020]  Hear that Maddie's got a point guys.
[33:16.020 --> 33:18.740]  If you're in another state, if we can legalize weed there, what the hell?
[33:19.420 --> 33:21.940]  Legalize cannabis around the country would make things so much easier.
[33:22.900 --> 33:23.220]  Yeah.
[33:23.260 --> 33:25.740]  And have less people in jail for pointless crimes.
[33:25.740 --> 33:29.860]  And make some money off of cannabis taxes because the state of Colorado makes a shit
[33:29.900 --> 33:30.060]  ton.
[33:30.060 --> 33:32.420]  I could Google it, but that'll give me, give me sidetracked.
[33:32.460 --> 33:35.980]  They make a whole shit ton of money off legalized cannabis.
[33:35.980 --> 33:37.340]  Since it's 2015.
[33:37.340 --> 33:38.180]  They released.
[33:38.220 --> 33:40.900]  I'll probably try to do that on episode 49 or 50.
[33:40.900 --> 33:41.940]  We'll talk about those numbers.
[33:41.940 --> 33:42.700]  We'll get Mike here.
[33:43.140 --> 33:44.140]  Mike's good with numbers.
[33:44.540 --> 33:45.780]  It'll make it sound eloquent.
[33:46.180 --> 33:46.860]  I would like to know.
[33:48.100 --> 33:48.620]  What's up, Mike?
[33:48.620 --> 33:49.460]  You've been working hard, bro.
[33:49.460 --> 33:51.300]  What's up, Adam, Jesse, that whole crew, Tony.
[33:51.740 --> 33:53.260]  Uh, they all been working their asses off.
[33:53.940 --> 33:54.700]  Uh, proud of them.
[33:54.700 --> 33:56.060]  They're getting some shit done.
[33:56.580 --> 33:57.780]  Uh, what am I supposed to say?
[33:57.820 --> 34:00.100]  Uh, fish cut faster.
[34:00.180 --> 34:01.460]  I think that's what I'm supposed to say.
[34:01.660 --> 34:01.940]  Yeah.
[34:01.980 --> 34:04.740]  They listened to the podcast at the worksite fish do something, bro.
[34:04.980 --> 34:05.940]  Fucking do something.
[34:06.300 --> 34:07.020]  Come on, man.
[34:07.060 --> 34:08.300]  You can play Xbox later, brother.
[34:08.380 --> 34:09.260]  Come on, man.
[34:10.380 --> 34:10.780]  All right.
[34:10.780 --> 34:14.100]  So full year of legalization and nobody's been fucking raped and killed.
[34:14.100 --> 34:15.020]  No kids with joints.
[34:15.020 --> 34:16.060]  What's my next question.
[34:16.380 --> 34:17.420]  Oh, the garden of Wheaton, bro.
[34:17.420 --> 34:19.060]  You guys want a bunch of awards this year.
[34:19.500 --> 34:22.740]  Um, what are some of your proudest achievements?
[34:24.340 --> 34:24.580]  Sorry.
[34:24.580 --> 34:25.540]  I just got deep on you.
[34:26.140 --> 34:29.860]  We had to go through a lot of hardships this year.
[34:29.860 --> 34:36.260]  So definitely getting our win for secret cup mountain was awesome for us, pulling
[34:36.260 --> 34:42.420]  everything together and getting our entry right and perfecting live resin or not.
[34:42.460 --> 34:46.740]  I don't know if you'd consider it perfecting, but working on, we just got
[34:46.740 --> 34:52.620]  really good at it, part of the pioneering process of libraries, trying to perfect
[34:52.660 --> 34:53.300]  live resin.
[34:53.540 --> 34:53.860]  Shit.
[34:53.860 --> 34:54.500]  But I've been dabbing.
[34:54.500 --> 34:55.340]  I call perfect.
[34:55.340 --> 34:56.340]  I don't know what else you're going to do.
[34:56.700 --> 34:57.740]  Shit's good enough.
[34:57.780 --> 34:58.020]  Right?
[34:58.340 --> 34:58.740]  Damn.
[34:59.580 --> 34:59.780]  Yeah.
[34:59.780 --> 35:03.620]  It was so awesome to win the secret cup because we were with all of our friends
[35:04.020 --> 35:06.740]  and it was an awesome competition.
[35:06.740 --> 35:10.740]  It's pretty fair in my opinion, because you have for, if anybody doesn't know,
[35:10.740 --> 35:13.380]  you have a box with how many entries were there this year?
[35:13.420 --> 35:15.660]  I think there were 32, maybe 30 something.
[35:15.700 --> 35:16.660]  It's just cool.
[35:16.660 --> 35:17.060]  Cause.
[35:17.500 --> 35:17.740]  Yeah.
[35:17.740 --> 35:19.660]  You get to compete with especially Colorado.
[35:19.660 --> 35:25.620]  Colorado's like the first place to do weed stuff.
[35:25.780 --> 35:26.100]  Yeah.
[35:26.220 --> 35:29.420]  So like now you got, it's supposed to be like the Mecca of oil maker.
[35:29.420 --> 35:34.460]  So it's cool to try to win that, you know, or win it for Colorado and compete
[35:34.460 --> 35:38.340]  against people, you know, who, cause she can't, it just won the Amsterdam cup.
[35:38.460 --> 35:38.980]  Yeah.
[35:39.020 --> 35:39.980]  With the Kong.
[35:40.540 --> 35:44.060]  But when I was standing there, I was standing next to my girl and they're
[35:44.060 --> 35:47.820]  like, when Big D announced it, he goes like, you all know who won first place.
[35:47.820 --> 35:48.980]  Are you already know who it is?
[35:48.980 --> 35:50.260]  And I was like, well, I don't know.
[35:50.460 --> 35:51.020]  I feel dumb.
[35:51.060 --> 35:55.460]  Cause I was like, well, I don't like, I was like, well, then that made me think,
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.740]  well, obviously it's not Spence.
[35:56.740 --> 35:59.540]  Cause it's something that would be, it's like going to be one of those popular
[35:59.540 --> 36:02.460]  guys that's got stickers everywhere and fucking everyone knows him and they were
[36:02.460 --> 36:03.980]  all high fiving him as he walked in.
[36:04.460 --> 36:08.340]  And I was like, I didn't fucking see bomb anywhere, but then he's like
[36:08.340 --> 36:09.340]  fucking garden of Wheaton.
[36:09.340 --> 36:12.620]  And I was, I, all I could say was, holy shit.
[36:12.620 --> 36:16.300]  And I just looked at my girl, like, did really, do we know them?
[36:16.460 --> 36:19.900]  Like, and you guys walked up to the front and she's like, shouldn't you go up there?
[36:19.900 --> 36:22.140]  And I was like, let my homie have his minute for a minute.
[36:22.180 --> 36:23.660]  Like, let him do his thing.
[36:23.660 --> 36:26.860]  And then everyone in the crowds are going to be like, they moved out of my way so
[36:26.860 --> 36:28.580]  that I could walk up towards you guys and shit.
[36:28.580 --> 36:29.420]  And I was like, oh, okay.
[36:29.420 --> 36:30.300]  I'll just go hang out.
[36:30.460 --> 36:31.660]  I was so shocked.
[36:31.660 --> 36:34.180]  I had, I had no idea we were going to win.
[36:34.180 --> 36:38.340]  When they called three and two, I was like, fuck, we have lost.
[36:38.660 --> 36:41.380]  Yeah, no, we were, me and Maddie were literally standing right next to each
[36:41.500 --> 36:46.980]  other. And they did like all like the lower, the next, the bottom awards, not
[36:46.980 --> 36:50.260]  bottom, but like most, yeah, all that.
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.940]  And we didn't win none of that.
[36:51.980 --> 36:52.980]  I was like, shit.
[36:53.580 --> 36:54.780]  And then they did third place.
[36:54.780 --> 36:56.780]  And it was, who was third place?
[36:57.060 --> 36:57.700]  Kyne Bill.
[36:57.740 --> 36:58.900]  Kyne Bill was third place.
[36:58.900 --> 37:00.380]  And I was like, oh shit.
[37:01.140 --> 37:04.060]  And then second place was, uh, Kushy Candy.
[37:04.060 --> 37:06.300]  And then I looked at Maddie, I was like, we ain't winning.
[37:07.340 --> 37:10.420]  And then he, he went through that whole round when I was like, damn.
[37:11.940 --> 37:12.420]  It was tight.
[37:12.420 --> 37:12.740]  It was cool.
[37:12.740 --> 37:13.780]  The look on your face was great.
[37:13.900 --> 37:15.780]  It was, you guys were kind of in shock for a minute.
[37:15.780 --> 37:16.420]  I think Maddie was.
[37:16.420 --> 37:17.060]  Spence was so shocked.
[37:17.060 --> 37:18.340]  He didn't even know what to say.
[37:18.340 --> 37:19.660]  So he just had to, you know.
[37:19.780 --> 37:20.940]  Oh, his speech was great though.
[37:21.020 --> 37:21.300]  Yeah.
[37:21.300 --> 37:22.020]  It was great.
[37:22.100 --> 37:22.420]  Yeah.
[37:22.460 --> 37:23.660]  It's something about running from here.
[37:23.660 --> 37:24.700]  So this is fucking cool.
[37:24.740 --> 37:26.900]  Like I moved here to do this and I did this.
[37:26.980 --> 37:27.260]  Yeah.
[37:27.380 --> 37:30.660]  The best part about it is we had all of our friends pretty much from North
[37:30.660 --> 37:32.580]  Carolina were at the event with us.
[37:32.580 --> 37:36.540]  So the best thing is to win with the people beside you that you started with.
[37:37.180 --> 37:40.220]  A lot of people thought that I grew that material and I had to correct a lot of
[37:40.260 --> 37:43.340]  them because Spence was wearing his IRI genetic hoodie and so was Maddie.
[37:43.580 --> 37:45.140]  I just rocked that shit all the time.
[37:45.140 --> 37:45.500]  I rocked.
[37:45.500 --> 37:46.460]  They're so comfy, bro.
[37:46.460 --> 37:47.540]  Those are some great hoodies.
[37:47.740 --> 37:48.660]  Like the logo is awesome.
[37:48.660 --> 37:49.940]  Mine's in the washer right now though.
[37:49.940 --> 37:50.460]  Getting cleaned.
[37:50.460 --> 37:53.940]  I got two of them because I got a, I got the dog hair situation going on.
[37:54.580 --> 37:56.340]  Shout out to all the dogs.
[37:56.340 --> 37:57.420]  Sirach, Nana.
[37:59.300 --> 38:00.220]  What's up Jerry boy?
[38:00.300 --> 38:00.980]  Are you listening?
[38:01.540 --> 38:01.900]  Maybe.
[38:02.380 --> 38:03.220]  Stella, are you there?
[38:04.500 --> 38:05.540]  Shout out to all the dogs.
[38:06.300 --> 38:07.420]  Uh, where was I?
[38:07.540 --> 38:08.020]  Oh yeah.
[38:08.020 --> 38:08.980]  Proudest achievements.
[38:08.980 --> 38:11.140]  So yeah, winning that secret cup, dude, that was fun.
[38:11.140 --> 38:11.860]  I was there with you.
[38:12.100 --> 38:14.660]  What's the other stuff you guys keep winning on Thursday nights?
[38:14.660 --> 38:16.780]  We won a top shelf Thursday in Denver.
[38:17.620 --> 38:21.380]  Um, it's at a, there's a social, there's like, there's multiple social clubs in
[38:21.380 --> 38:24.820]  Denver too, so if you're ever bored and you want to go smoke somewhere, just drive
[38:24.820 --> 38:27.180]  to Denver and Google social smoke club.
[38:27.540 --> 38:29.180]  This one particular is an Aurora.
[38:29.220 --> 38:31.180]  And this one's an Aurora off Colfax.
[38:31.180 --> 38:33.540]  It's called 710 social lounge.
[38:33.540 --> 38:33.740]  Yeah.
[38:33.740 --> 38:34.340]  I've heard of that one.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.420]  Ink therapy, either one.
[38:35.540 --> 38:35.900]  Okay.
[38:35.940 --> 38:36.980]  I'm going to try to remember those.
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.780]  But you can pay like a member price.
[38:39.180 --> 38:42.700]  You pay like 25 bucks and you can go in there for any time you want for a month
[38:42.700 --> 38:43.300]  and smoking.
[38:43.300 --> 38:43.980]  It's good to know.
[38:44.060 --> 38:44.500]  It's nice.
[38:44.500 --> 38:45.020]  It's really nice.
[38:45.020 --> 38:50.300]  And they've done last month they did, or last time they did a 16 person bracket.
[38:51.500 --> 38:54.980]  Just, and then it broke all the way down to the finals and then I won the finals.
[38:55.540 --> 38:58.020]  Um, got a free rig, got a bunch of stuff like that.
[38:58.020 --> 39:00.860]  Now they're doing another round and now it's 32 people.
[39:01.580 --> 39:05.780]  So it's a bigger bracket and they wanted me to do it, but I was just, I want to
[39:05.780 --> 39:07.500]  focus more on growing weed this year.
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.220]  There you go.
[39:08.300 --> 39:13.140]  And I still make oil, but I want to focus on making sure my weeds at where it
[39:13.140 --> 39:14.740]  should be at before I even make oil.
[39:14.780 --> 39:17.780]  And see, that's why I wasn't even making oil before I wanted to breed and make
[39:17.780 --> 39:18.820]  sure that shit was on point.
[39:18.820 --> 39:21.220]  Like do that and let you hash makers make my hash.
[39:21.380 --> 39:22.140]  It was working well.
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.740]  Hell yeah.
[39:22.780 --> 39:24.060]  But it was a lot of fun making hash.
[39:24.100 --> 39:26.060]  First thing I should go from, go ahead.
[39:26.300 --> 39:30.260]  Oh, one thing with all these competitions this year, also, we met a lot of amazing
[39:30.260 --> 39:35.500]  people in Denver specifically, because when we used to go to Denver, we used to
[39:35.500 --> 39:37.260]  not really know that many people.
[39:37.260 --> 39:39.500]  And then when we started going to the social club, we kind of
[39:39.500 --> 39:40.820]  connected with a lot of other people.
[39:40.820 --> 39:45.700]  So if you are new to Colorado, that's a good opportunity to meet a lot of other
[39:46.020 --> 39:48.060]  fellow dabbers, even if you're just.
[39:48.580 --> 39:53.300]  Somebody that's in the seven, 10 or four 20 community and you're from Colorado and
[39:53.300 --> 39:56.140]  you want other people to smoke with, like feel free for sure.
[39:56.580 --> 39:59.620]  Uh, find us it like, uh, I'll be at the cannabis cup for sure.
[39:59.940 --> 40:02.500]  I don't really, uh, rep the high times events, but I'll be there.
[40:02.500 --> 40:03.940]  It's the high times cannabis cup.
[40:03.940 --> 40:05.220]  It's April 19th.
[40:05.260 --> 40:07.220]  It's like the 18th, 19th, 20th.
[40:07.220 --> 40:07.380]  Yeah.
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.540]  It's three days this year.
[40:08.900 --> 40:10.780]  It's got a lot of dope ass events planned out.
[40:11.100 --> 40:11.620]  I'll be there.
[40:11.620 --> 40:12.660]  I will not have a booth.
[40:12.660 --> 40:13.460]  I was offered a booth.
[40:13.460 --> 40:14.140]  I declined.
[40:14.580 --> 40:16.900]  Uh, I'd rather roam around and do a task rock style.
[40:16.900 --> 40:18.740]  Just take my backpack and do what I can.
[40:19.220 --> 40:20.940]  Uh, yeah, it'll go quickly.
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.500]  I'm sure.
[40:21.860 --> 40:22.940]  But it's more fun that way.
[40:22.980 --> 40:26.420]  I don't, I feel tied down when I have a booth, I can walk around and go see who I
[40:26.420 --> 40:30.580]  want to, and then get the fuck out when I'm ready and then actually enjoy it.
[40:30.620 --> 40:30.940]  Yeah.
[40:30.980 --> 40:31.260]  Yeah.
[40:31.620 --> 40:32.940]  I'll get a booth in a couple of years.
[40:32.940 --> 40:33.900]  I'm just not ready for that.
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.940]  I don't want to invest into that and be tied down.
[40:35.980 --> 40:38.780]  I need to have some employees that'll run the booth the whole time for me.
[40:39.260 --> 40:40.300]  That's what I want before I'm there.
[40:40.300 --> 40:40.660]  Sure.
[40:40.740 --> 40:41.020]  Yeah.
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.060]  I'm not ready for that.
[40:42.820 --> 40:45.820]  So if you're looking forward to me having a booth at the cup, I apologize,
[40:45.820 --> 40:49.020]  but I'm really tall and really white and I got really long dreadlocks and I'm
[40:49.020 --> 40:52.220]  wearing an Irie genetics t-shirt and or hoodie and I got a backpack.
[40:53.020 --> 40:53.220]  Yeah.
[40:53.260 --> 40:54.060]  I'm easy to spot.
[40:54.460 --> 40:55.500]  We're easy to find.
[40:55.780 --> 40:56.140]  All right.
[40:56.220 --> 41:00.580]  So what's next for the garden of weed and you guys, I don't mean like the gym after
[41:00.580 --> 41:02.500]  this, I mean, you know, 2015.
[41:03.500 --> 41:09.460]  Spencer just said, focus on growing and get back to the basics and really work.
[41:09.500 --> 41:12.740]  Well, particularly lately, we've been working on our veg, just getting
[41:12.740 --> 41:15.180]  our veg, absolutely perfect.
[41:15.740 --> 41:19.420]  Um, and just making sure all of our stuff is top of the line, getting
[41:19.420 --> 41:21.700]  all of our equipment in check.
[41:22.300 --> 41:25.940]  Um, we just, for you new growers, did you hear what Maddie just
[41:25.940 --> 41:27.420]  said, pay attention to the veg.
[41:27.420 --> 41:29.220]  You guys don't pay enough attention to veg.
[41:29.260 --> 41:30.420]  I'm not scolding any of you.
[41:30.460 --> 41:32.300]  I'm just saying a lot of people don't pay enough attention.
[41:32.500 --> 41:33.780]  Not you specifically, not you.
[41:33.780 --> 41:34.140]  Sorry.
[41:34.340 --> 41:35.980]  You guys don't pay enough attention to veg.
[41:36.100 --> 41:37.220]  You could, you could pay more.
[41:37.220 --> 41:37.660]  I'm sure.
[41:38.220 --> 41:40.420]  Uh, love that bedroom as much as you love the flower room.
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.580]  Cause that's where it all starts.
[41:41.580 --> 41:43.140]  Healthy children make healthy adults.
[41:43.420 --> 41:44.460]  If you neglect your kids.
[41:44.460 --> 41:48.900]  Expect your flower plants to be amazing when you have a shitty veg.
[41:49.340 --> 41:55.820]  And sometimes even us, we sometimes start to get so caught up in our flower room
[41:56.100 --> 41:58.500]  that, like I said, our veg started falling behind a little bit.
[41:58.500 --> 42:03.660]  So we're going to work on just making sure all of our garden is in check.
[42:03.740 --> 42:04.420]  In check.
[42:04.660 --> 42:05.620]  You guys have a nice team.
[42:06.220 --> 42:07.940]  Uh, I like how you guys can handle shit.
[42:07.940 --> 42:08.740]  I've seen it happen.
[42:08.740 --> 42:09.780]  You're like, we got to do something.
[42:10.460 --> 42:12.340]  Squad stands up and it happens, bro.
[42:12.340 --> 42:12.860]  It's awesome.
[42:13.540 --> 42:15.060]  So fucking awesome to see what happened.
[42:15.060 --> 42:18.540]  We have a big Mike and he's our other part of shout out to big Mike.
[42:18.660 --> 42:19.220]  Solid.
[42:20.180 --> 42:20.940]  Bigger Mike.
[42:21.020 --> 42:21.780]  Call me big Mike.
[42:21.820 --> 42:23.220]  Nine one nine on Instagram.
[42:23.220 --> 42:23.660]  Check him out.
[42:23.660 --> 42:24.700]  That's one of our good homies.
[42:24.820 --> 42:26.740]  AKA Barack Ogonja.
[42:26.820 --> 42:27.500]  That's him.
[42:27.740 --> 42:28.300]  That's him.
[42:28.500 --> 42:30.020]  That's a rocking Nana's bodyguard.
[42:31.700 --> 42:32.220]  What's up, Mike?
[42:32.220 --> 42:35.140]  You can come be on the podcast whenever you want, bro, but we're going to give you big dabs.
[42:35.180 --> 42:36.700]  Mike isn't into the giant dab thing.
[42:36.700 --> 42:37.580]  Like we are over here.
[42:38.500 --> 42:39.260]  Glob squad.
[42:39.420 --> 42:40.660]  Glob squad.
[42:40.900 --> 42:41.300]  What's up?
[42:41.300 --> 42:41.940]  A sloppy.
[42:41.980 --> 42:42.460]  Love you, bro.
[42:42.500 --> 42:43.660]  Haven't heard from you in a little while.
[42:43.740 --> 42:45.140]  Uh, I don't have your new phone number.
[42:45.180 --> 42:46.340]  That's my excuse.
[42:46.340 --> 42:47.020]  And I really don't.
[42:47.020 --> 42:48.460]  Cause I'm texting the old phone number.
[42:48.460 --> 42:49.900]  Apparently I didn't know you had a new number.
[42:50.540 --> 42:50.980]  Oops.
[42:52.100 --> 42:53.060]  I wonder who I'm texting.
[42:53.060 --> 42:54.940]  Cause they shouldn't get those messages.
[42:55.820 --> 42:56.620]  Probably nobody.
[42:57.220 --> 42:57.860]  A dead phone.
[42:57.860 --> 42:58.380]  Whoopsie.
[42:58.860 --> 43:00.500]  Uh, you guys got anything left for the show?
[43:00.500 --> 43:02.060]  We've been going like 45 minutes.
[43:02.060 --> 43:02.580]  We should start.
[43:03.340 --> 43:04.420]  You want to do that part?
[43:04.460 --> 43:06.820]  Um, I'll go find that on YouTube.
[43:06.820 --> 43:07.380]  I think I got it.
[43:07.380 --> 43:07.900]  Save it.
[43:08.820 --> 43:09.660]  Spence is thinking.
[43:10.180 --> 43:10.980]  Don't think too hard, bro.
[43:10.980 --> 43:11.820]  It's just a podcast.
[43:11.860 --> 43:17.900]  I have just put the seeds that I germinated of the Lemon Jeffrey times cross.
[43:19.180 --> 43:20.820]  I hate when I say that.
[43:20.820 --> 43:22.020]  So you want to have that conversation?
[43:22.020 --> 43:23.060]  I hate when I say that.
[43:23.060 --> 43:23.380]  What do you guys think?
[43:23.780 --> 43:24.780]  Lemon J.
[43:24.820 --> 43:25.340]  K.
[43:27.020 --> 43:28.220]  KCGS.
[43:28.340 --> 43:28.860]  Oh, nice.
[43:29.260 --> 43:29.900]  Nice.
[43:30.180 --> 43:32.940]  So when you guys are, when we're talking, this is just random side talk.
[43:32.980 --> 43:37.220]  Uh, when we're talking about strains, a lot of times people, and I tried to avoid
[43:37.220 --> 43:40.020]  it also, but so many people said it, that I got sucked into it.
[43:40.020 --> 43:45.500]  A lot of people will say, uh, the fucking, the lemon times times the grateful dog.
[43:45.900 --> 43:47.980]  And I like to say crossed too.
[43:48.580 --> 43:49.540]  But so what do you guys think?
[43:49.540 --> 43:53.020]  Tweet me that, uh, it's at I grow culture, which I wish I could change that, but I
[43:53.020 --> 43:53.300]  can't.
[43:53.700 --> 43:57.620]  Uh, the show name is different and I don't want to lose all my Twitter followers.
[43:57.620 --> 43:58.220]  I'll think about it.
[43:58.220 --> 43:59.020]  We'll see what we can do.
[43:59.340 --> 44:02.140]  Just make a new one and then add the link to that one.
[44:02.140 --> 44:04.020]  And that one, just double click it.
[44:04.020 --> 44:04.700]  I might have to do it.
[44:04.700 --> 44:05.340]  I'm gonna write it down.
[44:05.340 --> 44:05.940]  New Twitter.
[44:07.380 --> 44:08.260]  But tell me what you think.
[44:08.300 --> 44:09.300]  Well, how should we say that?
[44:09.300 --> 44:10.460]  Is that, what does that X mean?
[44:10.540 --> 44:11.380]  Cause it's not math.
[44:11.380 --> 44:12.660]  It doesn't mean times.
[44:12.860 --> 44:13.260]  Yeah.
[44:13.300 --> 44:17.700]  Personally, like when I just said it, it's a, like a pet peeve of mine.
[44:17.740 --> 44:18.900]  Times two.
[44:19.900 --> 44:20.820]  Would make the four.
[44:21.060 --> 44:24.460]  You know, if we, if you, if two bone two, it would have four was what would come out.
[44:24.980 --> 44:29.380]  And so still though, I just don't, I mean, it technically could be right.
[44:29.380 --> 44:30.140]  Me personally.
[44:30.140 --> 44:33.500]  I just think when it comes out of my mouth, it just does not sound right.
[44:33.500 --> 44:34.460]  Cause we're not doing math.
[44:36.060 --> 44:37.420]  So let's start something new.
[44:37.780 --> 44:37.900]  Yeah.
[44:37.900 --> 44:38.620]  What's the new one?
[44:39.140 --> 44:42.060]  If you come up with something in the next 30 seconds, I'll give you the opportunity
[44:42.060 --> 44:43.100]  to create a new term.
[44:43.140 --> 44:46.540]  If you can think of something better, we're putting you on the slide.
[44:46.540 --> 44:46.860]  Right?
[44:47.540 --> 44:48.420]  I have to think of something.
[44:48.780 --> 44:49.220]  Cool.
[44:49.500 --> 44:51.780]  Can I get like phone a friend or something?
[44:51.780 --> 44:52.180]  I don't know.
[44:53.020 --> 44:54.020]  You can take a dab alive.
[44:54.300 --> 44:55.540]  That's how long you get to think it through.
[44:56.580 --> 45:00.460]  I'll try to get this dab of live resin for you, man.
[45:00.740 --> 45:02.900]  One time I'm going to have you come on the show until the whole process.
[45:05.380 --> 45:06.420]  I can't afford that.
[45:06.500 --> 45:08.100]  I should get all this money for that shit.
[45:10.260 --> 45:11.260]  You'll just beat box it.
[45:11.300 --> 45:12.300]  You ain't got to pay money for that.
[45:12.580 --> 45:12.980]  Right.
[45:13.140 --> 45:13.780]  I may have to.
[45:13.780 --> 45:14.780]  That's why I was cutting her off.
[45:15.980 --> 45:16.700]  Did it over her.
[45:16.940 --> 45:18.620]  We could just do an F for fuck.
[45:20.140 --> 45:21.020]  No, we said that.
[45:21.020 --> 45:25.020]  That one was cool, but just to not, we're not going to be all, it doesn't beat
[45:25.020 --> 45:25.540]  times.
[45:25.580 --> 45:26.860]  I can't think of anything.
[45:26.860 --> 45:27.420]  The lemon Jeff.
[45:27.420 --> 45:28.500]  Fuck the grateful dog.
[45:28.500 --> 45:31.820]  I can't say that when I talk like at the cannabis cup to people, they were going
[45:31.820 --> 45:32.460]  to be offended.
[45:32.780 --> 45:33.860]  Some people might like it.
[45:34.140 --> 45:34.380]  Yeah.
[45:34.380 --> 45:39.220]  So an F is for Feniel for a generational label.
[45:39.820 --> 45:40.060]  Okay.
[45:40.180 --> 45:42.700]  All right, Maddie, I'll let you take the dab and we'll let you try again.
[45:42.780 --> 45:43.980]  That was, I'll let you try again.
[45:44.020 --> 45:44.340]  All right.
[45:44.500 --> 45:44.580]  Okay.
[45:46.500 --> 45:47.220]  Oh, you guys hear that?
[45:47.220 --> 45:50.140]  I was trying to let her, there it is.
[45:52.220 --> 45:53.500]  Chick takes big dabs, dude.
[45:54.540 --> 45:56.060]  Maddie takes bigger dabs than you.
[45:56.060 --> 45:56.540]  I'm sure.
[45:57.100 --> 45:57.860]  Yeah.
[45:58.460 --> 45:59.780]  In the garden, we can get weeded.
[46:01.300 --> 46:01.540]  All right.
[46:01.540 --> 46:04.580]  Now that you're blowing out a fat dab and starting off into the sky, what's the
[46:04.580 --> 46:05.060]  new word?
[46:09.870 --> 46:11.030]  Nobody else can help.
[46:11.070 --> 46:13.790]  No, you're the one that you talking about.
[46:13.790 --> 46:16.110]  If you're the one protesting, you should find a solution.
[46:16.350 --> 46:16.590]  Okay.
[46:16.590 --> 46:20.310]  Can we, can we, you want me to pause and let you take a drink and cope with life
[46:20.310 --> 46:20.830]  for a minute?
[46:21.310 --> 46:23.030]  Can we, can I think about it?
[46:23.030 --> 46:25.870]  And next podcast, we can come back with something better.
[46:25.910 --> 46:26.230]  Okay.
[46:26.390 --> 46:27.950]  Hey, do you guys want to be on episode number 50?
[46:28.630 --> 46:33.030]  We'll try to get you to and Adam and Jesse and Mike.
[46:33.070 --> 46:34.030]  I think I can do that.
[46:34.550 --> 46:35.910]  I think I can fit that many people.
[46:36.310 --> 46:37.110]  That's, that's a lot.
[46:37.110 --> 46:37.430]  Let me know.
[46:37.430 --> 46:39.790]  I'll go buy some mics and then return them motherfuckers.
[46:43.830 --> 46:45.470]  That's the shit your black friends will do.
[46:45.470 --> 46:46.550]  Hey, I want to give you guys a shout out.
[46:46.550 --> 46:48.990]  You were on time as fuck and that's crazy.
[46:49.070 --> 46:49.350]  Yeah.
[46:49.670 --> 46:52.150]  That's only because I dragged him out of the house.
[46:52.150 --> 46:55.990]  And Michael may, you know, your house is that close to Amy donut.
[46:56.110 --> 46:56.470]  Oh yeah.
[46:56.510 --> 46:58.190]  I got some Amy's donuts on the counter.
[46:58.230 --> 46:59.270]  Shout out to Amy's donuts.
[46:59.270 --> 47:01.230]  I got a stomachache and a toothache both from them.
[47:01.270 --> 47:03.630]  But this nigga, Michael may salmon.
[47:03.630 --> 47:03.870]  What?
[47:03.870 --> 47:05.110]  Wild rice.
[47:05.350 --> 47:07.430]  He tried to tell me that wild rice ain't rice.
[47:07.470 --> 47:09.190]  I was like, bro, what the fuck they call it?
[47:09.190 --> 47:09.870]  Wild rice.
[47:10.470 --> 47:12.110]  Then he made what kind of carrots he made?
[47:13.110 --> 47:21.110]  Glazed carrots with lemon and some portabella mushrooms sauteed with spinach.
[47:21.110 --> 47:21.790]  That was banging.
[47:21.790 --> 47:26.710]  And Spencer's reply when it all got sat down was this is some white people shit.
[47:27.470 --> 47:27.910]  Yeah.
[47:27.910 --> 47:29.190]  But I bet you ate it up.
[47:29.230 --> 47:32.870]  Just like I ate the salmon, the rice and then the mush.
[47:32.910 --> 47:33.830]  I just like mushrooms.
[47:33.870 --> 47:34.230]  I'm cool.
[47:34.230 --> 47:34.630]  I fucked.
[47:34.630 --> 47:34.870]  Yeah.
[47:34.870 --> 47:36.030]  I got us here on time.
[47:36.630 --> 47:37.190]  Yeah, you did.
[47:38.070 --> 47:38.830]  I appreciate it.
[47:39.150 --> 47:41.590]  I don't know if this is, if I'm going to double up, if I play a.
[47:42.150 --> 47:43.030]  The garden of Weeden song.
[47:43.030 --> 47:44.310]  I don't know if I have some other shit playing.
[47:44.310 --> 47:45.550]  I don't want to play two songs at once.
[47:45.550 --> 47:46.510]  See, I'm glad I checked.
[47:46.510 --> 47:47.710]  See, I'm learning, bro.
[47:48.070 --> 47:51.310]  So learning, we're going to double up on two songs out of him.
[47:51.390 --> 47:52.390]  Awkward sounding.
[47:52.950 --> 47:53.430]  No fuck.
[47:53.430 --> 47:54.590]  Everyone's heads all up.
[47:55.270 --> 47:55.550]  All right.
[47:55.550 --> 47:57.270]  We're going to start wrapping up the show before we go.
[47:57.270 --> 47:58.350]  I do want to say a couple of things.
[47:58.350 --> 47:59.710]  First, I want to thank you guys for coming to this.
[47:59.710 --> 48:00.590]  An awesome podcast.
[48:00.590 --> 48:01.070]  That was fun.
[48:01.350 --> 48:01.670]  Problem.
[48:01.670 --> 48:10.190]  I have to be the first girl on the, or the first woman, woman credit woman on the show at your location.
[48:10.630 --> 48:11.030]  It's awesome.
[48:11.030 --> 48:11.310]  Thank you.
[48:11.310 --> 48:11.670]  Thank you.
[48:11.670 --> 48:12.190]  Fist bump.
[48:12.390 --> 48:13.590]  Ooh, Spence is looking at the weed.
[48:13.590 --> 48:15.470]  There's some lemon Jeffrey over there in a jar that I grew.
[48:15.870 --> 48:18.950]  There's some platinum OG, some girls got cookies, some grateful dog and some lemon.
[48:18.950 --> 48:19.310]  Jeff.
[48:20.710 --> 48:21.590]  Grown by me.
[48:21.630 --> 48:22.270]  Take a peek.
[48:22.350 --> 48:23.710]  I can't tell what it is from that angle.
[48:23.750 --> 48:24.470]  That's grateful dog.
[48:24.470 --> 48:25.110]  I think.
[48:26.110 --> 48:26.670]  I think so.
[48:26.670 --> 48:27.430]  Crack it open.
[48:27.470 --> 48:28.670]  Cracking nugs.
[48:28.830 --> 48:30.110]  I'm going to talk while he does that.
[48:30.190 --> 48:31.710]  Uh, yeah, guys, thanks for coming.
[48:31.750 --> 48:34.110]  Um, let me remind you guys a couple of things.
[48:34.110 --> 48:35.030]  I am changing the name.
[48:35.070 --> 48:36.110]  It's not, I grow culture.
[48:36.110 --> 48:37.470]  It's the grow from your heart podcast.
[48:37.470 --> 48:40.190]  Now I don't want to get sued by that other company.
[48:40.510 --> 48:44.990]  As I could use a new logo, by the way, I'm trying to see, you know, well, it's my
[48:44.990 --> 48:48.030]  fault that we'd bet fall out there, but it's so sticky.
[48:48.030 --> 48:48.390]  It won't.
[48:48.430 --> 48:50.430]  No, it's a, I stole somebody's name on accident.
[48:50.470 --> 48:54.190]  I didn't realize it, but they got all popular and now they're like, Oh, you do.
[48:54.190 --> 48:54.630]  We got it.
[48:55.910 --> 48:56.110]  Yeah.
[48:56.110 --> 48:56.790]  And they don't like that.
[48:56.790 --> 48:57.910]  So, but it's cool.
[48:57.910 --> 48:58.590]  I got a cool name.
[48:58.590 --> 48:59.150]  Grow from your heart.
[48:59.150 --> 48:59.590]  Sounds good.
[48:59.630 --> 49:00.390]  That's what it's all about.
[49:01.430 --> 49:02.350]  Could use a logo.
[49:02.710 --> 49:03.830]  You keep asking for a new song.
[49:03.830 --> 49:04.150]  You know what?
[49:04.150 --> 49:06.550]  I'm going to keep playing that song from the mystic roots band and other
[49:06.550 --> 49:07.630]  mystic roots band songs.
[49:07.630 --> 49:09.390]  Cause they said I could, and they're free and I like it.
[49:10.150 --> 49:12.270]  I'm canceling the Instagram for the podcast.
[49:12.310 --> 49:15.350]  There won't be an, uh, I grow culture podcast Instagram, but
[49:15.350 --> 49:17.230]  the IRI genetics one will exist.
[49:17.470 --> 49:18.310]  What are you going to take?
[49:18.310 --> 49:20.030]  Are you going to leave it up for a week?
[49:20.190 --> 49:22.590]  I'll leave it up so you can go steal all the pictures or whatever.
[49:22.590 --> 49:23.710]  It's just the links.
[49:23.750 --> 49:24.310]  That's all you need.
[49:25.270 --> 49:28.630]  I'll just start, uh, posting those pictures to the IRI genetics, Instagram
[49:28.630 --> 49:31.350]  and have one feed instead of having two feeds I'm trying to keep up with.
[49:31.350 --> 49:32.230]  It's just a lot of shit.
[49:32.710 --> 49:34.910]  I know that sounds like a bunch of bitching, but it is.
[49:35.230 --> 49:38.550]  And I'll probably cancel the YouTube for the podcast also.
[49:38.590 --> 49:41.390]  And just keep the, and start doing something with the IRI
[49:41.390 --> 49:42.630]  genetics, YouTube or something.
[49:43.550 --> 49:45.190]  Just so much goddamn media.
[49:45.190 --> 49:47.750]  I can't keep up and I want to focus on doing a good podcast is
[49:47.750 --> 49:49.110]  really what I'm wanting to do.
[49:49.750 --> 49:53.190]  If you guys want to email me, you can use I grow culture at hotmail.com or
[49:53.230 --> 49:55.030]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[49:55.030 --> 49:55.830]  I check them both.
[49:56.350 --> 49:57.670]  Episode 50 is coming up.
[49:57.990 --> 49:58.950]  I think Spence will make it.
[49:58.950 --> 49:59.910]  I think Maddie will make it.
[49:59.910 --> 50:02.990]  We'll have Jesse, hopefully, trying to get my, trying to get Adam.
[50:03.070 --> 50:03.830]  You guys are invited.

[50:20.270 --> 50:20.590]  Yeah.
[50:20.590 --> 50:22.310]  So episode 50 will be a small celebration.
[50:22.310 --> 50:25.030]  Jesse, uh, teased that he would have some prizes.
[50:25.030 --> 50:25.910]  I definitely have.
[50:26.310 --> 50:30.350]  Uh, at least an IRI genetics t-shirt or three to give away like a hat pin.
[50:30.670 --> 50:32.190]  Anybody's got any prizes or something?
[50:32.430 --> 50:33.070]  I got some t-shirts.
[50:33.190 --> 50:33.690]  Okay.
[50:34.210 --> 50:34.710]  Yeah.
[50:34.810 --> 50:35.770]  Let me, let me check.
[50:35.810 --> 50:39.170]  We got some, I got some, I got some, you got some garden of
[50:39.170 --> 50:40.810]  Weeden prizes coming on episode 50.
[50:40.810 --> 50:41.690]  You guys always write the water.
[50:41.690 --> 50:42.450]  We'll leave it like that.
[50:42.450 --> 50:43.290]  Random prize.
[50:43.330 --> 50:43.730]  Yeah. Yeah.
[50:43.730 --> 50:44.690]  That's kind of what I'm doing too.
[50:44.690 --> 50:46.930]  Until I run downstairs and check the little box that I've been, I've
[50:46.930 --> 50:49.890]  been just throwing shit into a pile, you know, I don't want to dedicate too much.
[50:50.250 --> 50:52.610]  But when episode 50 comes, Jesse's promised some stuff.
[50:52.610 --> 50:55.410]  So what's up, Jesse, if you're listening to episode 50 is in like a week and a
[50:55.410 --> 50:56.570]  half, if you're listening to this.
[50:57.890 --> 50:59.730]  Uh, guys, I want you to message me.
[50:59.730 --> 51:01.930]  Let me know what you learned on the podcast.
[51:02.050 --> 51:04.450]  Cause we want to talk about that on episode 50 and recap for you.
[51:04.450 --> 51:05.490]  Like we did the year in review.
[51:05.490 --> 51:07.730]  I kind of want to know your, uh, what you learned from the show.
[51:07.730 --> 51:09.090]  I want to know who your favorite guests were.

[51:26.690 --> 51:29.090]  Uh, I'd kind of rather reserve your knowledge for when it's just you and I
[51:29.090 --> 51:31.850]  face to face, cause you fucking school me and it's awesome.
[51:32.570 --> 51:35.650]  So guys, if there's somebody around here, you'd like to have on the podcast, let me
[51:35.650 --> 51:36.150]  know.
[51:36.530 --> 51:38.130]  It's hard for me to reach out to people.
[51:38.530 --> 51:41.170]  Uh, if you have something you want me to ask other people and you have some ideas,
[51:41.170 --> 51:44.930]  if you're like, get this person on, back that up with a like, and ask them this.
[51:44.970 --> 51:45.570]  And I'll do that.
[51:45.570 --> 51:46.370]  Cause that'll help me out.

[52:12.370 --> 52:14.570]  Uh, since Spence had that idea, it's kind of smart.
[52:14.570 --> 52:16.630]  I probably will grow from your heart.
[52:16.630 --> 52:17.850]  We'll have a new Twitter page.
[52:17.890 --> 52:19.890]  I'm sure there's something that's growing from your heart somewhere else.
[52:19.890 --> 52:23.130]  That's going to fucking try to sue me for that too, but it's what we're going to do.

[53:23.710 --> 53:25.230]  Definitely brought the Yeti OG.
[53:25.230 --> 53:27.030]  That's one of our favorites.
[53:27.070 --> 53:28.550]  The flavor on it's ridiculous.
[53:28.590 --> 53:30.190]  That rig dude broke my face.
[53:30.230 --> 53:33.230]  It made her a whole challenge to do a podcast at the beginning.
[53:33.230 --> 53:33.950]  It was kind of neat.
[53:34.310 --> 53:34.950]  Uh, make sure you follow.
[53:34.950 --> 53:36.230]  I read genetics on Instagram.

[53:56.870 --> 53:58.830]  Thanks again for listening to you guys until next time.
[53:58.870 --> 54:01.030]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[54:01.030 --> 54:03.430]  We're going to end the show with the song by our boy sloppy.
[54:03.750 --> 54:05.030]  It's a garden song.
[54:05.030 --> 54:06.550]  It takes a second for it to roll in.
[54:06.550 --> 54:08.230]  So we might just ramble for a second.
[54:08.630 --> 54:11.670]  Uh, I'm actually going to fire up a big dab of this live resident and then we'll
[54:11.670 --> 54:14.270]  turn the mics down and let the song kick on in the garden.
[54:14.270 --> 54:15.030]  We didn't get weeded.
[54:16.630 --> 54:17.150]  Goodbye.
[54:17.390 --> 54:17.950]  Bye y'all.
[54:21.180 --> 54:23.980]  Everyone's why you got to make it up any fun song.
[54:23.980 --> 54:24.500]  So, you know,
[54:31.300 --> 54:32.700]  I didn't read it in this bitch.
[54:38.220 --> 54:38.980]  Back to your spot.
[54:38.980 --> 54:50.800]  Like, you know, no other turn on each other and kill your brother.

[54:58.600 --> 54:59.400]  Always got to work.
[54:59.400 --> 55:01.080]  You can call me when you need it in the garden.
[55:01.080 --> 55:02.840]  We didn't get weeded in the car.
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.280]  The way to get in the garden, we didn't get weeded in the garden way to get weeded.
[55:07.920 --> 55:10.320]  I just call it how I see it in the garden.
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.160]  We didn't get weeded in the garden.
[55:12.160 --> 55:12.880]  We didn't get weeded.
[55:13.120 --> 55:14.760]  We didn't get weeded.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.600]  We didn't just call it how I see it.
[55:17.120 --> 55:18.360]  I just call it how I see it.
[55:19.040 --> 55:21.400]  Only fire when I breathe it in the garden.
[55:21.400 --> 55:22.040]  We leave with your girlfriend.
[55:22.040 --> 55:24.040]  Yeah, we did fucking all weekend to the weekend.

[55:25.480 --> 55:25.880]  I need it.
[55:25.880 --> 55:27.240]  And all enemies get defeated.
[55:27.400 --> 55:28.160]  Drama don't need it.

[55:31.960 --> 55:34.660]  Too far gone, getting lost in the abyss Lost in my spliff
[55:34.660 --> 55:37.960]  Spirit molecule getting lost in the rift LSD when I trip
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.660]  If you try and chip, you can catch this flip If you try and chill, you can catch this flip
[55:41.660 --> 55:43.460]  Reppin' for the beast, coach, right in my weed smoke

[55:58.860 --> 56:01.460]  I ain't fearing man, I just fear myself
[56:01.460 --> 56:04.960]  Better be your own hero, break your own chains
[56:04.960 --> 56:08.660]  Control your own lane, influence your own brain
[56:08.660 --> 56:12.960]  Dodging all the fangs in the hands of the puppeteers
[56:12.960 --> 56:15.960]  Homeless dreams, no movement, ain't no puppets here
