[00:02.560 --> 00:05.520]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.720]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.580]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.580 --> 00:15.780]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.780 --> 00:17.980]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.980 --> 00:22.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.660 --> 00:28.120]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.120 --> 00:31.900]  All right, podcast world, I am here with what I am going to call a Thursday Quickie.
[00:31.900 --> 00:36.520]  I am out of Throwback Thursday episodes, so until I generate a bunch of content, I'm
[00:36.520 --> 00:38.900]  going to try to throw out these Thursday Quickies.
[00:38.900 --> 00:42.460]  I can't promise you a quickie every week, but when we get to one, you'll be glad you
[00:42.460 --> 00:43.460]  showed up.
[00:43.460 --> 00:47.340]  Now, since I'm all caught up on the Throwback Thursday episodes, I'm going to work extra
[00:47.340 --> 00:49.820]  hard at getting the YouTube channel caught up.
[00:49.820 --> 00:52.760]  That's where all the old content will be stored.
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.600]  The thing about the Throwback Thursday episodes was iTunes will only allow me 100 episodes
[00:57.600 --> 00:58.600]  in my feed.
[00:58.600 --> 01:03.480]  I felt like some of my really valuable content was within my first 100 episodes.
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.680]  That got pushed out of the feed, so I wanted a place for the old content to be accessible.
[01:08.680 --> 01:11.320]  I made that the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.640]  Unfortunately, that's just pushing new content out of the feed.
[01:14.640 --> 01:17.520]  It's just perpetuating the problem.
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.680]  YouTube does not limit me on how many uploads and videos I post, so I can put all 300 episodes
[01:23.680 --> 01:24.680]  up there.
[01:24.680 --> 01:25.680]  I've only got 288 now.
[01:25.680 --> 01:26.680]  We're working toward 300.
[01:26.760 --> 01:29.520]  I'll be able to put all 300, all 500 up there.
[01:29.520 --> 01:30.760]  It won't be a problem.
[01:30.760 --> 01:33.560]  It's just going to take me time to get them up.
[01:33.560 --> 01:35.320]  They will be archived on YouTube.
[01:35.320 --> 01:37.720]  We'll start getting fresh content coming out to you guys.
[01:37.720 --> 01:41.600]  I'm not going to promise these Thursday episodes every week, but like I said, when I get to
[01:41.600 --> 01:44.760]  it, it will be worth checking out.
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.080]  That's where we are for now with the Thursday situation.
[01:48.080 --> 01:49.080]  Welcome to the show, you guys.
[01:49.080 --> 01:50.080]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:50.080 --> 01:52.640]  I like to share what I'm smoking on at the start of the podcast.
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.040]  That's kind of a tradition here.
[01:54.040 --> 01:57.200]  I am a big fan of the Apothecary Extracts lately.
[01:57.200 --> 01:59.080]  I've got myself some Titan OG.
[01:59.080 --> 02:02.080]  I'm going to crack this open and give it a sniffer.
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.320]  It smells like OG, you guys.
[02:03.320 --> 02:06.720]  It smells exactly like what you'd expect an OG to smell like.
[02:06.720 --> 02:09.960]  It smells like, I always say coffee.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.280]  I think OG has a little bit of coffee.
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.840]  There's a little bit of chocolate to it.
[02:14.840 --> 02:21.440]  Then there's a silky smooth undertone that I cannot identify.
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.640]  That's really nice.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.880]  It's kind of bubba cushy.
[02:23.880 --> 02:27.120]  It's got sort of a bubba cush sort of a smell, kind of a pre-98 bubba cush.
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.920]  If you've ever smoked that, it's sort of what it smells like.
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.520]  But I've got the Titan OG batter.
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.640]  I keep describing the texture of the batter as battery.
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.720]  It looks like thick butter or soft cheesecake or cake batter.
[02:39.720 --> 02:43.040]  I just scooped a gram of it perfectly into the center of this container.
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.280]  And then I've been taking the Titan OG, and then I like to take the Titan OG batter, and
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.160]  I've got some Blue Ghost High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum.
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.160]  I said high cannabinoid.
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.040]  I really went in on that word.
[02:53.040 --> 02:55.360]  High cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals.
[02:55.360 --> 02:58.920]  And I like to take the batter, get a nice chunky size dab, and then just dip it into
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.040]  the crystals and pick up a couple of crystals to go with it.
[03:02.040 --> 03:04.000]  Then dab that all together.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.560]  And the lung expansion, the head high, it's been a great high.
[03:06.560 --> 03:10.400]  I like the crystals don't have a lot of flavor, but they have a lot of THC.
[03:10.400 --> 03:12.240]  So the mix is really nice for me.
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.440]  But that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[03:14.440 --> 03:17.800]  Also been dabbing on some of the sour Clem, of course, that is almost gone because I've
[03:17.800 --> 03:19.280]  been going in on that.
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.840]  And then I'm finishing up the Garden of Weeden Sour Diesel batter as well.
[03:23.840 --> 03:26.880]  I've been smoking a lot of variety.
[03:26.880 --> 03:27.960]  Excuse the throat clearing, you guys.
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.240]  I apologize for that.
[03:29.240 --> 03:31.600]  It's all the concentrates I've been dabbing.
[03:31.600 --> 03:34.320]  Did I mention that this podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.320]  Bank?
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.320]  That's right.
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.000]  If you need some irigenetic seeds, check out the Hella Dank Seed Bank at dankseed.store.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Let's move forward.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.520]  I was just talking about batter, right?
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.680]  Somebody said something about batter to me the other day.
[03:45.680 --> 03:47.320]  They're like, I don't know why you smoke that batter.
[03:47.320 --> 03:50.520]  I would prefer my concentrates to be purged.
[03:50.520 --> 03:54.200]  And I paused and the look on my face said, what the fuck?
[03:54.200 --> 04:01.160]  You guys, if you are buying batters from a reputable dispensary in Colorado or even most
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.220]  likely on the black market, the batters are better purged than some of the shatters or
[04:06.220 --> 04:08.920]  some of the other concentrates.
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.400]  Now I don't know how everybody makes their concentrates, but this is kind of how a batter
[04:12.400 --> 04:13.400]  is made.
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.640]  The batter comes from the way that they're doing it at Apothecary is they are starting
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.960]  with their Ambrosia, which is their premier product.
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.400]  The Ambrosia is basically the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals with high terpene
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.160]  full spectrum extract terps poured into it and they mix it at their ratios and it's beautiful.
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.720]  It's crystally, it's terpy.
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.440]  I don't buy it myself because I don't want the terp soup at the bottom.
[04:36.440 --> 04:37.480]  It's hard to scrape it up.
[04:37.480 --> 04:40.880]  I'd rather get the batter where it all comes with me in one chunk.
[04:41.360 --> 04:46.000]  They take the Ambrosia and they'll take a portion of the Ambrosia and then they whip
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  it.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.200]  They will not tell me how it's whipped.
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.640]  They won't tell me their technique.
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.980]  I've seen it done several different ways.
[04:51.980 --> 04:57.480]  A lot of guys use a glass wand and you heat the concentrate and you just whip it like
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.800]  a whisk with your wrist with the glass wand.
[04:59.800 --> 05:01.520]  You just whip the shit out of it with that glass wand.
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.640]  You let your wrist get floppy and just whisk it and all you're doing is adding air to it.
[05:05.640 --> 05:09.720]  Now think about if you have a product like Ambrosia, which is a quality product.
[05:09.720 --> 05:12.400]  In Colorado, we have lab testing that shows residuals.
[05:12.400 --> 05:19.000]  If you have too many residual PPMs of a gas of a hydrocarbon, which is what butane would
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.200]  be, if there are too many residuals of that hydrocarbon of the butane in there, you're
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.720]  not allowed to sell the product.
[05:24.720 --> 05:27.800]  So the Ambrosia passes the test already.
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.260]  Then they take that and they whip the shit out of it to turn it into batter.
[05:31.260 --> 05:34.920]  When you're whipping it and putting all that oxygen into it, don't you think they're going
[05:34.920 --> 05:37.960]  to let out any more butane that would have been in there?
[05:37.960 --> 05:39.500]  That would release that also.
[05:39.500 --> 05:46.020]  The batters actually test cleaner for residual PPMs than the shatters and the Ambrosias.
[05:46.020 --> 05:48.180]  That's going to be true most of the time.
[05:48.180 --> 05:51.300]  They also seem to be, it brings out the turps a little bit.
[05:51.300 --> 05:54.140]  When you put that air into it, it brings out the turps.
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.140]  I am not a scientist.
[05:55.140 --> 05:59.420]  I have nothing to base this on except my own thought process.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.420]  There's no reading.
[06:00.420 --> 06:01.900]  There's no influence here.
[06:01.900 --> 06:06.380]  When you crack open wine or beer, when the air, when you pour it into a certain glass,
[06:06.380 --> 06:11.700]  they serve alcoholic beverages in certain shaped glasses to create certain air flows.
[06:11.700 --> 06:17.220]  And I think that air flow mixing in with the concentrate enhances the terpenes.
[06:17.220 --> 06:20.620]  There's something about the way you whip it and add the oxygen in there.
[06:20.620 --> 06:22.460]  It makes it more aromatic.
[06:22.460 --> 06:23.460]  And that's just my opinion.
[06:23.460 --> 06:24.860]  I don't know the science behind it.
[06:24.860 --> 06:27.980]  So it is purged and it also tastes really good.
[06:27.980 --> 06:32.200]  And I really like the way the batters expand on the lungs.
[06:32.200 --> 06:37.480]  So if you seem to think that batters are not purged, most of the time they are better purged.
[06:37.480 --> 06:40.400]  Now I'm going to segue into another part here.
[06:40.400 --> 06:47.200]  I've been smoking PHO, which is propane honey oil, and this stuff is purged.
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.200]  But something about the propane honey oil, I talk about I enjoy the lung expansion on
[06:52.200 --> 06:53.760]  the batter.
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.360]  I do not like the way the PHO makes my lungs feel.
[06:58.360 --> 07:04.080]  Whenever I take a big dab, a medium dab, a small dab of PHO, it feels like an elephant
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.320]  is sitting on my chest.
[07:05.320 --> 07:09.400]  It feels like I'm in some jujitsu hold that I do not want to fucking be in and I want
[07:09.400 --> 07:10.400]  to tap out.
[07:10.400 --> 07:11.400]  It hurts.
[07:11.400 --> 07:12.680]  I don't like smoking PHO.
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.180]  I've got about a gram left and I'll smoke it because I bought it and it gets me high
[07:17.180 --> 07:18.760]  as giraffe pussy.
[07:18.760 --> 07:24.420]  But I will not buy more and I'll probably pass on propane honey oil dabs should somebody
[07:24.420 --> 07:26.840]  offer them to me.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.640]  It feels like I'm drowning when I smoke that shit.
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.760]  I don't like it.
[07:29.760 --> 07:32.520]  I can smoke a gram dab of good PHO.
[07:32.520 --> 07:36.600]  If you gave me a half gram dab of shatter right now, I might cough a little bit because
[07:36.600 --> 07:40.040]  I've been dabbing all day and I've been talking and I'm kind of dehydrated.
[07:40.040 --> 07:45.920]  But a half gram dab wouldn't hurt my feelings of some shatter of PHO, butane honey oil.
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.000]  But a half gram dab of propane honey oil would fucking kill me.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.240]  I wouldn't be able to talk for an hour and it wouldn't be the high.
[07:53.240 --> 07:55.640]  It would just be the lung pressure and the lack of oxygen.
[07:55.640 --> 07:57.880]  I wouldn't be able to inhale and exhale properly.
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.760]  It just feels so heavy.
[08:00.760 --> 08:01.920]  And that's even when it's clean.
[08:01.920 --> 08:05.240]  I don't know why, but that's just something that I've mentioned.
[08:05.240 --> 08:09.000]  So the batter is purged you guys and PHO makes my lungs heavy.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.400]  That's the summary of what I just rambled about.
[08:11.400 --> 08:12.400]  So it's a Thursday quickie.
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.240]  I'm going to move quickly through the topics.
[08:14.240 --> 08:17.600]  I've just got a couple of bullet points that I want to talk about.
[08:17.600 --> 08:22.520]  Something I noticed and that I've wanted to talk about a lot of people water their plants,
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.000]  not incorrectly, but in a way that is maybe inefficient and there's a better way you could
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  do it.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.760]  A lot of people aim for the center of the pot when they water a plant, they get a pitcher
[08:32.760 --> 08:36.040]  of water or the hose, the water wand or whatever.
[08:36.040 --> 08:39.100]  Or maybe they're using one of those fancy water cans from target with the flower painted
[08:39.100 --> 08:41.120]  on the side and it's got your mom's name printed on it.
[08:41.120 --> 08:45.560]  But whatever you're watering with, they aim for the center of the pot, which is not a
[08:45.560 --> 08:46.760]  good idea.
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.080]  It would be better if you delivered the water to the outer edge of the pot.
[08:51.520 --> 08:53.960]  And when your plants are little, yeah, you should probably water the middle where the
[08:53.960 --> 08:55.160]  plants and where the roots are.
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.720]  But when your plants are large and they have grown to meet the size pot that they are in,
[08:59.720 --> 09:02.960]  when the roots are filling the pot in which they are sitting, you should water the outer
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.800]  edge, the outer area with more water and then less water toward the middle.
[09:07.800 --> 09:12.440]  The reason for that is that inside is going to get saturated and it's going to stay wet
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.800]  in there longer.
[09:13.800 --> 09:16.120]  And those roots are going to find water.
[09:16.120 --> 09:18.000]  The water is going to be right there in the middle.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  The roots will grow.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  They will stretch.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.400]  They will look for water.
[09:21.400 --> 09:23.960]  If you water that outer edge, they'll go out there and get that water.
[09:23.960 --> 09:27.360]  If you keep flooding the inside, those roots will just stay there and get bored and get
[09:27.360 --> 09:28.360]  stagnant.
[09:28.360 --> 09:29.360]  You got to make them work.
[09:29.360 --> 09:31.360]  Water the outside and the roots will go out to the outside.
[09:31.360 --> 09:34.280]  You'll get your nutrients out to the outside by watering it out there.
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.560]  You'll get water out there.
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.240]  Those roots will go out there also.
[09:37.240 --> 09:41.520]  You'll develop a larger root system and a bigger root system will make a bigger, happier,
[09:41.520 --> 09:42.840]  more productive plant.
[09:42.840 --> 09:45.080]  And I think that's what we want overall.
[09:45.080 --> 09:48.520]  So stop watering directly in the middle water toward the outer edge.
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.260]  If you've got a bad habit of watering directly in the middle, our friend Mr. Spliff taught
[09:53.260 --> 09:56.800]  us to make little pyramids, little domes in the middle of the plant.
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.000]  Grab some dirt and just make a little cone right around the trunk of the plant.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.120]  And that way when you do water, all the water runs away from the trunk and it runs out to
[10:03.120 --> 10:04.120]  the outer edge of the pot.
[10:04.120 --> 10:07.880]  Then it sinks down in there and then it gets the outer edge wet and then those roots have
[10:07.880 --> 10:10.600]  nutrients and water out there at the outer edge and they'll grow.
[10:10.600 --> 10:12.320]  And then you don't flood the middle of the pot.
[10:12.320 --> 10:15.640]  Because the middle of the pot is going to stay soggy a little bit longer.
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.000]  That outer edge is going to dry up.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.440]  So get it wet.
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.000]  If you actually look at the shape of a cannabis plant and the way that the leaves work, how
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.520]  many times have you tried to water the plant when you're in the grow room and you're kneeling
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.480]  down and you've got your watering device and you keep hitting the leaves with the water
[10:29.480 --> 10:33.640]  and it pushes the leaves out to the outer edge of the pot or even onto the floor?
[10:33.640 --> 10:37.560]  In my opinion, cannabis plants are sort of shaped like an umbrella and the way that the
[10:37.560 --> 10:39.360]  leaves work is sort of umbrella like.
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.040]  The water will land on the leaf and the leaf will bend down just enough to let that water
[10:44.040 --> 10:46.640]  drip off onto the next leaf and that leaf bends and that leaf bends.
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.160]  And as it does it, it pushes the water outward.
[10:49.160 --> 10:51.800]  Like I just spread my arms like you could see it.
[10:51.800 --> 10:53.840]  It pushes the water outward with each leaf.
[10:53.840 --> 10:57.120]  As it falls, it moves further and further from the center of the plant until it hits
[10:57.120 --> 10:59.320]  the ground and then it lands.
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.520]  And I bet that the water makes a nice little ring around the cannabis plant.
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.840]  I bet if you stood directly above a lot of trees and watched water fall, you'd see a
[11:06.840 --> 11:08.960]  nice ring around a lot of trees.
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.480]  And I bet that's where the most productive root system is in those trees is right around
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.580]  that perimeter where the rain is allowed to fall.
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.140]  Keep in mind, your cannabis plants are shaped like an umbrella.
[11:20.140 --> 11:23.100]  They probably want that water to get spread out like that also.
[11:23.100 --> 11:28.420]  Cannabis roots seem to prefer wider spaces than deeper spaces.
[11:28.420 --> 11:31.060]  So if you can give it a wider space, it'll grow wider.
[11:31.060 --> 11:34.220]  Your plant will have, I mean, just imagine if you spread your legs, you can hold your
[11:34.220 --> 11:35.940]  balance better than if you put your feet together.
[11:35.940 --> 11:39.100]  So you could grow wider if you could spread your feet further.
[11:39.100 --> 11:42.900]  So water the outer perimeter of the pot.
[11:42.900 --> 11:43.900]  That's what I'm getting at.
[11:43.900 --> 11:46.060]  All right, one more quick thing and then we're going to end this quickie.
[11:46.060 --> 11:47.060]  I'm giving you a warning.
[11:47.060 --> 11:48.060]  I'm almost done.
[11:48.060 --> 11:53.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is illegal in the state of Colorado to take your cannabis on
[11:53.140 --> 11:56.720]  federal property, federal property like a state park.
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.120]  You cannot go in a state park with your medical or recreational cannabis.
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.500]  Even if you're an adult, if you've got cannabis and you go to the Pueblo Reservoir or any
[12:06.500 --> 12:09.460]  other reservoir, I'm just trying to think of random state parks.
[12:09.460 --> 12:11.300]  You cannot go to Mueller State Park.
[12:11.300 --> 12:14.540]  You cannot go to Golden Gate Canyon State Park.
[12:14.540 --> 12:19.100]  You cannot go to Garden of the Gods with medical or recreational cannabis on you.
[12:19.100 --> 12:23.620]  If you are caught in possession of medical or recreational cannabis with or without a
[12:23.620 --> 12:27.820]  medical marijuana card, you will be charged with illegal possession of cannabis because
[12:27.820 --> 12:32.240]  that is federal land and cannabis is not federally legal.
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.100]  It is only legal in the state of Colorado by state law.
[12:36.100 --> 12:39.860]  Federal law supersedes that, especially when you were on federal land, you were playing
[12:39.860 --> 12:41.740]  by their rules and their laws.
[12:42.180 --> 12:47.140]  If you come to Colorado and you want to go get some cannabis and you want to go see some
[12:47.140 --> 12:51.660]  sites, make sure that you do not end up on federal land.
[12:51.660 --> 12:53.660]  Do not go to a state park.
[12:53.660 --> 12:55.780]  Do not go to a university.
[12:55.780 --> 12:59.020]  Do not go to a military base.
[12:59.020 --> 13:03.520]  Of course, you'd probably be paranoid to take your cannabis on your military base, but we
[13:03.520 --> 13:10.300]  have a friend of the podcast who her husband is part of Fort Carson, the military base
[13:10.380 --> 13:11.900]  in Colorado Springs.
[13:11.900 --> 13:14.820]  She is a well-known cannabis patient and advocate.
[13:14.820 --> 13:20.100]  She has to be very careful not to take her medical and recreational cannabis onto the
[13:20.100 --> 13:22.340]  base when she goes with her husband.
[13:22.340 --> 13:24.060]  So she has to keep that in mind.
[13:24.060 --> 13:28.860]  I actually have another friend who had to write a letter to his higher up.
[13:28.860 --> 13:30.140]  I can't remember the rank.
[13:30.140 --> 13:32.620]  I apologize for being ignorant in military ranks.
[13:32.620 --> 13:36.640]  He had to write a letter and apologize and request permission to still be allowed to
[13:36.640 --> 13:42.640]  hang out with his friends on the base because he was caught with medical marijuana.
[13:42.640 --> 13:45.880]  He was lucky that he had his medical marijuana recommendation with him.
[13:45.880 --> 13:50.640]  He was lucky that he'd been outspoken about his medical marijuana activism and his PTSD
[13:50.640 --> 13:55.260]  experiences in the past, or it may not have worked out so well for my friend, but they
[13:55.260 --> 13:58.320]  did have some compassion for him and they let him go.
[13:58.320 --> 14:03.280]  But he had to write a letter and apologize and request permission to go back onto the
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.920]  base and promise to never bring his medical marijuana or his recreational marijuana back
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.120]  to the base ever again.
[14:11.120 --> 14:14.480]  So he's very careful not to because they will arrest him next time.
[14:14.480 --> 14:19.080]  So you guys be very careful if you're going to a reservoir to do some jet skiing, some
[14:19.080 --> 14:21.500]  boating, please do not take your cannabis.
[14:21.500 --> 14:26.360]  If you do be fucking careful because if they catch you with it, you were on federal land.
[14:26.360 --> 14:28.080]  I don't know what they can do to you.
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.200]  You will certainly be charged with illegal possession of cannabis.
[14:31.200 --> 14:34.600]  If you're not old enough, if you're not 21, you may be a minor in possession.
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.840]  If you're not 18, you may be a minor in possession of cannabis.
[14:37.840 --> 14:40.440]  I don't know what could happen to you on federal land.
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.240]  I wish Mike were here, but it would be awkward having a quickie with Mike.
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.880]  All right, podcast world.

[16:37.950 --> 16:39.310]  life's a blessing.
[16:39.310 --> 16:40.950]  So why we stressing?
[16:40.950 --> 16:43.870]  For the things we go through, there's a lesson.
[16:43.870 --> 16:46.910]  Study the roots, truth and professing.
[16:46.910 --> 16:49.630]  It's all for you, there is no rejection.
[16:49.630 --> 16:52.430]  Take a sip from the cup of life.
[16:52.430 --> 16:55.630]  Drink a night of juice, burn out the parasites.
[16:55.630 --> 16:58.750]  Now walk on the beach, or walk on the mountainside.
[16:58.750 --> 17:01.430]  Tranquility, a peaceful life.
[17:01.430 --> 17:04.390]  All about the good vibes that flow everyday.
[17:04.390 --> 17:07.430]  All about giving your thanks and praise.
[17:07.430 --> 17:10.430]  I love to see the blessing of the human race
[17:10.430 --> 17:13.030]  Don't want no war, don't want no rat race
[17:13.030 --> 17:16.030]  I'm all about the sprouting and planting of seeds
[17:16.030 --> 17:19.230]  I'm all about the good things that grow on the trees
[17:19.230 --> 17:21.830]  I said the people in a one harmony
[17:21.830 --> 17:25.230]  I'm all about creation, creative energy
[17:25.230 --> 17:28.230]  When the rain falls in the spring
[17:28.230 --> 17:31.230]  Oh, what a blessing it bring
[17:31.230 --> 17:34.030]  The flowers bloom, trees turn green
[17:34.030 --> 17:37.430]  And everything has been washed clean
[17:37.430 --> 17:42.430]  See the people working outside
[17:42.430 --> 17:48.430]  Everyone with a smile in the warm sunshine
[17:48.430 --> 17:51.830]  Working to bring justice to the line
[17:51.830 --> 17:54.830]  I'm at a straight redemption time
[17:55.830 --> 17:57.830]  Redemption time
[17:58.430 --> 18:00.430]  I said redemption time
[18:00.430 --> 18:03.430]  I'm all about the good vibes that flow every day
[18:03.630 --> 18:06.630]  All about giving your thanks and praise
[18:06.630 --> 18:09.430]  I love to see the blessing of the human race
[18:09.430 --> 18:12.430]  We don't love the war, we don't want rat race
[18:12.430 --> 18:15.430]  All about the sprouting and planting of seeds
[18:15.430 --> 18:18.230]  All about the cannabis that grows on the trees
[18:18.230 --> 18:21.430]  I love to see the people in a one harmony
[18:21.430 --> 18:25.430]  About creation, creative energy
[18:27.230 --> 18:29.430]  Creative energy
[18:30.430 --> 18:35.470]  Creative energy
[18:35.470 --> 18:38.470]  They built it, this world of illusion
[18:38.470 --> 18:41.470]  And still it, with their lies and confusion
[18:41.470 --> 18:44.470]  Baba Tawa has lost all power
[18:44.470 --> 18:47.470]  Come out of her, this is the final hour
[18:47.470 --> 18:50.470]  We bless the bread and we bless the wine
[18:50.470 --> 18:53.470]  Remember the covenant from Mount Sinai
[18:53.470 --> 18:56.470]  I'm coming in the name of Yah El Shaddai
[18:56.470 --> 18:59.470]  Baruch Atah Hashem Adonai
[18:59.470 --> 19:01.470]  Enter the presence of the King
[19:01.470 --> 19:03.470]  We'll keep the Sabbath holy
[19:03.470 --> 19:05.470]  Drink from the life-giving stream
[19:05.470 --> 19:08.470]  Every day from Mashiach I sing
[19:08.470 --> 19:11.470]  Bringing knowledge and overstanding
[19:11.470 --> 19:14.470]  I'm all about the good vibes that flow every day
[19:14.470 --> 19:17.470]  All about giving your thanks and praise
[19:17.470 --> 19:20.470]  I'm all about the blessing of the human race

[19:23.470 --> 19:26.470]  I'm all about the sprouting and planting of seeds
[19:26.470 --> 19:29.470]  I'm all about the truth will set us free
[19:29.470 --> 19:32.470]  We should all be living in harmony
[19:32.470 --> 19:35.470]  It's all creation, creative energy
[19:36.470 --> 19:40.470]  Creation, creation, creation
[19:47.470 --> 19:49.470]  Good vibes that flow every day
[19:49.470 --> 19:53.470]  I'm all about giving the most high, the praise
[19:53.470 --> 19:55.470]  I want to see the blessing of the human race
[19:55.470 --> 19:58.470]  I don't have time for war, no time for rat race
[19:58.470 --> 20:01.470]  Life's a blessing, so why we stressing?
[20:01.470 --> 20:04.470]  For the things we go through there is a lesson
[20:04.470 --> 20:07.470]  It's all for you and there is no rejection
[20:07.470 --> 20:09.470]  Positive meditation
[20:10.470 --> 20:13.470]  I'm all about the good vibes that flow every day
[20:13.470 --> 20:16.470]  All about giving your thanks and praise
