[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Alright, here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:04.880]  It's time for episode 488 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.880 --> 00:08.140]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:08.140 --> 00:13.100]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:13.100 --> 00:21.000]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.360]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.360 --> 00:29.900]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Infinity OG Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:29.900 --> 00:33.240]  This is a blend of Lumpa's Headmand and I-95.
[00:33.240 --> 00:37.580]  On the package, the flavor is described as gas, earth, and bitter skunk.
[00:37.580 --> 00:39.380]  I absolutely agree with that.
[00:39.380 --> 00:44.420]  This stuff smells ridiculous, it tastes amazing, and it is super potent.
[00:44.420 --> 00:50.900]  On the back of the package, the label says it contains 65.06% THC and non-detectable
[00:50.900 --> 00:52.580]  amounts of CBD.
[00:52.580 --> 00:57.220]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for this delicious and potent Infinity
[00:57.220 --> 00:58.220]  OG.
[00:58.740 --> 01:02.580]  Alright Podcast World, in this episode I'm going to cover a couple of breeding terms
[01:02.580 --> 01:05.040]  that I left out in the last episode.
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.340]  Before we get there, let's give a shout out to a few of our friends that support the show
[01:09.340 --> 01:11.500]  on Patreon.

[01:14.700 --> 01:16.140]  Gro and Granny.
[01:16.140 --> 01:18.500]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Karen Crawford.
[01:18.500 --> 01:21.940]  I'd like to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast high five thank you shout out to my
[01:21.940 --> 01:23.620]  buddy Glenn Gironi.
[01:23.620 --> 01:27.260]  I need to send a giant thank you shout out to OkieGrow720.
[01:27.300 --> 01:31.540]  Of course I need to send a huge thank you shout out to Dude Dank UK.

[01:52.700 --> 01:56.820]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:56.820 --> 02:00.980]  All right, I'm going to talk about some breeder talk in this episode, but before I get there,
[02:00.980 --> 02:03.380]  I've got a couple more things I should mention.
[02:03.380 --> 02:07.300]  One thing that is really important, my friend Clint just left and he wanted me to make sure
[02:07.300 --> 02:08.820]  to tell everybody hello.
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.940]  So big shout out from my friend Clint to all of you guys.
[02:11.940 --> 02:13.520]  Clint come back on the show sometime.
[02:13.520 --> 02:15.060]  Come hang out when you've got more time.
[02:15.060 --> 02:16.060]  Don't be a stranger.
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.340]  Anyway, Clint wanted me to say hello.
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.720]  I told him I would say hello.
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.720]  So there we go.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.720]  Shout out from Clint.
[02:20.720 --> 02:21.720]  What's up, dude?
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.720]  I hope you hear this.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.720]  What is next?
[02:23.720 --> 02:25.980]  Let's talk about my garden update.
[02:26.140 --> 02:30.520]  Occasionally, I like to update you folks on what is happening in my garden.
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.300]  If you have been following along, you know that I recently pollinated several females
[02:35.300 --> 02:39.180]  with a reversed blueberry cookies pollen donor.
[02:39.180 --> 02:43.340]  That was a blueberry cookies female plant that was treated with a solution that encouraged
[02:43.340 --> 02:47.500]  that plant to create pollen, which only contains female chromosomes.
[02:47.500 --> 02:52.500]  That pollen will be put on several selected females, and that will make several lines
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.340]  of feminized seeds.
[02:55.380 --> 02:59.780]  In that room of females being pollinated by the reversed blueberry cookies is, of course,
[02:59.780 --> 03:03.300]  another blueberry cookies female that will receive pollen.
[03:03.300 --> 03:04.660]  There's a platinum tangy.
[03:04.660 --> 03:06.380]  There's a strawberry fields.
[03:06.380 --> 03:07.960]  There's a lemon skunk.
[03:07.960 --> 03:10.620]  There's also a female of my favorite, arise.
[03:10.620 --> 03:13.400]  And also there is a Durban poison in that room.
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.900]  There also may be a couple of other females in there that have not been pollinated by
[03:17.900 --> 03:20.740]  this reversed blueberry cookies before.
[03:20.740 --> 03:22.860]  So when those seeds are done, I will test them.
[03:22.860 --> 03:25.180]  I'll get some out to my other tester friends.
[03:25.180 --> 03:28.060]  We'll see if they are up to par, if they meet my standards.
[03:28.060 --> 03:30.220]  And if so, we will add those to the lineup.
[03:30.220 --> 03:34.040]  The next time I reverse the blueberry cookies, I will make more of those, and we will release
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.540]  those with the rest of the lineup.
[03:36.540 --> 03:39.800]  But the females in the room have been successfully pollinated.
[03:39.800 --> 03:41.340]  The pistils are starting to get brown.
[03:41.340 --> 03:42.960]  They're kind of curling up.
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.260]  It has been about three or four days since I pollinated, and I can already see that there
[03:47.260 --> 03:50.060]  are plenty of seeds developing in that room.
[03:50.060 --> 03:51.980]  I've cleaned up most of the excess pollen.
[03:51.980 --> 03:54.500]  I've taken a shot back and sucked up all the corners.
[03:54.500 --> 03:56.420]  I'll clean up the room real well.
[03:56.420 --> 03:59.800]  At this point, I just need to keep feeding the plants really well and make sure nothing
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.800]  goes wrong.
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.660]  In just a few days, I will adjust the timer, and I will give my plants more light to encourage
[04:05.660 --> 04:07.380]  healthier, fatter seeds.
[04:07.380 --> 04:12.220]  And those seeds should finish in about 50 to 60 days.
[04:12.220 --> 04:17.520]  This episode should come out on December 11th, which means those seeds should be ready around
[04:17.520 --> 04:19.920]  the end of February.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.900]  So that is what is happening in my garden.
[04:21.900 --> 04:23.900]  We have had successful pollination.
[04:23.900 --> 04:26.420]  I can visibly see that the pistils are curling up.
[04:26.420 --> 04:29.900]  I can visibly see the spots where seeds are beginning to form.
[04:29.900 --> 04:31.540]  The plants look very happy.
[04:31.540 --> 04:34.260]  All of the equipment in the room seems to be in good shape.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.260]  Everything is dialed in.
[04:35.260 --> 04:36.860]  Everything is running properly.
[04:36.860 --> 04:40.340]  It is a little bit cold outside, which makes it really easy to keep the temperatures in
[04:40.340 --> 04:41.340]  the room nice.
[04:41.340 --> 04:43.700]  I don't have to compete with the hot, sunshiny days.
[04:43.700 --> 04:46.740]  This should be a very successful situation.
[04:46.740 --> 04:51.860]  I'm going to increase the amount of light hours, which will make the seeds harvest earlier.
[04:51.860 --> 04:53.920]  They will also be fatter and more healthy.
[04:53.920 --> 04:56.780]  So right now, I think we're on the perfect path.
[04:56.780 --> 04:59.700]  All right, that's what's happening in the grow room.
[04:59.700 --> 05:02.580]  Let's get onto the main topic of this podcast.
[05:02.580 --> 05:07.060]  I said I wanted to cover some glossary terms, some things I may have missed in a previous
[05:07.060 --> 05:09.560]  episode when I was talking about breeding.
[05:09.560 --> 05:14.280]  Let's jump into that and talk about some popular terms that you may see on seed packaging.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.420]  You may see in forums.
[05:15.420 --> 05:18.820]  You just may hear people talking about when it comes to growing and breeding.
[05:18.820 --> 05:20.760]  Let's talk about some of those terms.
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.260]  In the last episode, I kept saying to work something, to take a strain or a plant and
[05:25.260 --> 05:26.260]  work it.
[05:26.260 --> 05:28.080]  What did I mean by work it?
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.420]  Let's say that I bought a pack of seeds from a breeder.
[05:30.420 --> 05:33.460]  That breeder is called water bottle because there's a water bottle in front of me.
[05:33.460 --> 05:38.180]  So this water bottle breeder sold me a package of seeds and I grow those seeds.
[05:38.180 --> 05:40.380]  I find a male out of those seeds.
[05:40.380 --> 05:44.760]  I have got free reign to breed with that male because I have paid for those seeds.
[05:44.760 --> 05:45.800]  Those are mine.
[05:45.800 --> 05:47.920]  Nobody can tell me what to do, in my opinion.
[05:47.920 --> 05:50.160]  Nobody can tell me what to do with my seeds.
[05:50.160 --> 05:52.920]  Nobody can tell me what to do with my plants once I've paid for them.
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.920]  They're in my garden.
[05:53.920 --> 05:55.240]  I've done my work with them.
[05:55.240 --> 05:58.960]  And I feel the same way about the seeds that I breed that are available to people.
[05:58.960 --> 06:01.480]  If you've got my seeds, you're allowed to breed with them.
[06:01.480 --> 06:02.800]  I can't stop you.
[06:02.800 --> 06:03.960]  I almost encourage it.
[06:03.960 --> 06:07.780]  I want to see what my plants will do in future generations.
[06:07.780 --> 06:09.680]  I feel like breeding is really fun.
[06:09.680 --> 06:10.680]  It's really fulfilling.
[06:10.680 --> 06:14.200]  And if that's something you want to do, my seeds offer great potential.
[06:14.200 --> 06:16.320]  So I almost encourage you to breed with my stuff.
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.600]  But let's get back on track.
[06:17.600 --> 06:19.880]  I've got a pack of water bottle seeds here.
[06:19.880 --> 06:21.000]  This guy sold me some seeds.
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  They're great.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  I find a male in there.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.120]  I choose to breed with that male.
[06:25.120 --> 06:26.120]  That's cool.
[06:26.120 --> 06:27.320]  But I didn't work the male.
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.660]  I just used water bottle's work to create more stuff.
[06:31.660 --> 06:37.360]  What I should do is use water bottle's male to some other person's female or another female
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.440]  that I've worked with and then create my own seed and then use a male out of that.
[06:42.440 --> 06:45.280]  I've got to do some work to it to kind of make it my own.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.280]  Not just grabbing stuff off the shelf and mixing it together.
[06:48.280 --> 06:51.160]  I've got to do a little bit of ingredient working myself.
[06:51.160 --> 06:53.040]  I've got to do the work on my own.
[06:53.040 --> 06:54.320]  That's what I mean when I say work it.
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.240]  Not just get a plant, get a clone, get a male plant out of a pack of seeds and do some dusting
[06:59.240 --> 07:00.880]  and make seeds.
[07:00.880 --> 07:01.880]  That's acceptable.
[07:01.880 --> 07:02.880]  That works.
[07:02.880 --> 07:05.760]  But it means a little bit more when a breeder does some working.
[07:05.760 --> 07:09.800]  When you take things to different generations, when you inbreed or outbreed or back cross
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.800]  or do some work to it, you just have to do a little work, make it your own instead of
[07:13.800 --> 07:18.440]  just using that pack of seeds from water bottle, using his male and making my own seed
[07:18.440 --> 07:20.320]  company out of that.
[07:20.320 --> 07:24.000]  So if you're just breeding for your own personal fulfillment, feel free to use whatever male
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.080]  you've got access to that fits your breeding criteria.
[07:27.080 --> 07:31.280]  But if you're trying to put something to market, it's better etiquette to work something and
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.440]  build your own male instead of just pulling something out of a pack and reproducing more
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.480]  stuff out of that.
[07:36.480 --> 07:40.920]  That's what I meant when I kept saying work it and make it your own in the last episode.
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.240]  Now let's move forward and talk about something a little more useful.
[07:44.240 --> 07:48.800]  What is a phrase that I hear quite often that may be confusing to some growers?
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.460]  The phrase is, clone only.
[07:51.460 --> 07:57.320]  In a previous episode, I spoke about Gorilla Glue number 4 being a clone only strain.
[07:57.320 --> 08:02.480]  I also talked about Golden Goat being a clone only and Girl Scout Cookies being a clone
[08:02.480 --> 08:03.480]  only.
[08:03.480 --> 08:06.280]  Now what do I mean by a clone only strain?
[08:06.280 --> 08:11.200]  What I mean by a clone only is that no males of these plants were ever released and no
[08:11.200 --> 08:15.080]  seeds of these plants were ever released by the original breeders.
[08:15.080 --> 08:20.960]  So the female that was released is known as a clone only because there was no way to reproduce
[08:20.960 --> 08:21.960]  that plant.
[08:21.960 --> 08:26.040]  The only way it was circulated was as a clone, a very specific cut.
[08:26.040 --> 08:30.360]  And we're going to talk about specific cuts and cut names in a minute here.
[08:30.360 --> 08:34.680]  So when I'm saying clone only, I mean it's only available in clone form.
[08:34.680 --> 08:39.360]  So something like Golden Goat and Gorilla Glue, those plants just happen to be accident,
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.200]  but they are also clone only because the person who created those plants never intended to
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.600]  make seeds for commercial production.
[08:46.600 --> 08:48.340]  So those seeds were never released.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.840]  They grew those small batches themselves.
[08:50.840 --> 08:56.920]  Then they found the keeper, the prized cut out of those seeds, the star phenotype.
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.520]  Then they gave that clone out to their friends and they never released any males or any seeds.
[09:03.520 --> 09:06.160]  So it is a clone only female.
[09:06.160 --> 09:09.520]  Now I know people are already going, but I've got seeds of Golden Goat.
[09:09.520 --> 09:11.240]  You put out seeds of Golden Goat.
[09:11.240 --> 09:13.360]  How can that be a clone only?
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.080]  There are breeders like myself and many others who have learned how to reverse plants, which
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.720]  means I can take a clone only plant and I can treat it with a solution.
[09:22.720 --> 09:27.460]  That solution will trigger a hormone reaction inside of the plant, which makes it create
[09:27.460 --> 09:33.400]  pollen sacs, which contain pollen, which only contain female chromosomes.
[09:33.480 --> 09:38.360]  Then I take that female Golden Goat pollen and put it right back on a female Golden Goat
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.440]  plant and I make female Golden Goat seeds.
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.600]  Until that became a popular practice and a lot of people started learning how to do it,
[09:46.600 --> 09:52.720]  these clone only strains were much more sought after and were much harder to acquire.
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.280]  Now I do believe if you grow my Golden Goat from seed, you should label the bag and all
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.480]  of your plants Golden Goat S1 because it is not the original Golden Goat cut.
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.320]  It will be a very close representation, but it is your responsibility to properly label
[10:09.320 --> 10:11.800]  it as a Golden Goat S1.
[10:11.800 --> 10:14.520]  So that is what we mean when we say a clone only.
[10:14.520 --> 10:15.920]  That plant is a clone only.
[10:15.920 --> 10:18.880]  There were never seeds released by the original breeder.
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.360]  The only way you're going to find seeds of that is if somebody made feminized seeds or
[10:23.360 --> 10:28.380]  perhaps maybe somebody did a back cross, but that needs to be labeled appropriately.
[10:28.380 --> 10:34.240]  If you're making seeds, please learn how to label them correctly and please do not mislead
[10:34.240 --> 10:35.240]  people.
[10:35.240 --> 10:38.320]  Now I also said we would talk about specific cuts.
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.800]  What does it mean when I hear that there's a strain and then there's a specific cut of
[10:42.800 --> 10:43.800]  that strain?
[10:43.800 --> 10:48.160]  A very popular example is the Mac from Capulator.
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.120]  The Mac is a plant that is available in seed form.
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.520]  So you can buy Mac seeds.
[10:55.520 --> 10:58.440]  The Mac is also available in a clone.
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.920]  There is a very popular Mac cut known as Mac 1.
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.000]  It is also known as Capulator's cut.
[11:06.000 --> 11:15.040]  Now Cap did release the Mac in seed form, but he has also shared his favorite cut with
[11:15.040 --> 11:19.440]  his friends and there is a story and some rules that go along with the Mac cut.
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.100]  You've got to share it with growers that you respect and people that you feel will
[11:22.100 --> 11:24.400]  deserve it and you cannot take money for it.
[11:24.400 --> 11:25.400]  It's got to be gifted.
[11:25.400 --> 11:27.160]  There are some rules that come with that cut.
[11:27.160 --> 11:29.680]  I really appreciate and respect that.
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.520]  But the one that Capulator gave out to people is Cap's cut.
[11:34.520 --> 11:36.320]  That is Mac 1.
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.680]  So it has been labeled Mac 1 and Cap's cut to indicate that that is the sought after
[11:41.680 --> 11:44.760]  prized cut from that batch of seeds.
[11:44.760 --> 11:50.320]  You can buy the seeds, but you cannot label any of the seeds that come from that batch
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.020]  Cap's cut or Mac 1.
[11:53.020 --> 11:58.440]  You can label it the Mac if that's what the seed pack says, but you cannot call it Mac
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.080]  1 because Mac 1 is a clone only.
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.020]  And that's just the first strain that came to the top of my head when I wanted to talk
[12:05.020 --> 12:09.900]  about strains that are clone only that have their own specific name.
[12:09.900 --> 12:12.640]  So that may also be known as a breeder's cut.
[12:12.640 --> 12:16.020]  I've also got a prized cut of my Arise.
[12:16.020 --> 12:20.840]  Of course, I've got almost unlimited amounts of seeds of Arise that I can grow through.
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.980]  I have grown a lot of Arise plants.
[12:22.980 --> 12:26.100]  I've been able to select my favorites out of countless seeds.
[12:26.100 --> 12:28.680]  I've got a cut that is a champion.
[12:28.680 --> 12:32.320]  If I were to release that, I call that the breeder's cut.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.780]  That's the one everybody would want.
[12:33.780 --> 12:35.440]  That is the best one you're going to find.
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.360]  I've called several to replace them with this one and I upgrade.
[12:39.360 --> 12:43.240]  Anytime I find one that's better, that one replaces the older one.
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.400]  So I've got the breeder's cut of Arise.
[12:46.400 --> 12:49.440]  There is an Arise number 4 that I've released to a few friends.
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.660]  They carefully label it Arise number 4 because that is a popular sought after cut.
[12:54.660 --> 12:55.760]  That is the breeder's cut.
[12:55.760 --> 12:57.440]  It is the number 4.
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.920]  So that's how some of these strains get their names.
[12:59.920 --> 13:01.880]  That's why they get called specific cuts.
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.540]  You may see like the Prophet, the 505 cut.
[13:06.540 --> 13:10.220]  That's because the Prophet was bred by Irie Genetics.
[13:10.220 --> 13:15.580]  But my friends down in Albuquerque found a very beautiful phenotype of the Prophet and
[13:15.580 --> 13:19.820]  they call it the 505 cut because they pass it around and they share it.
[13:19.820 --> 13:23.220]  And so when other people grow the Prophet and they offer clones and they're like, hey,
[13:23.220 --> 13:27.700]  I got clones of the Prophet, their friends will probably go, you got that 505 cut or
[13:27.700 --> 13:29.380]  did you just grow it from seed?
[13:29.380 --> 13:31.380]  Because everybody's going to want that 505.
[13:31.380 --> 13:32.700]  That's the special one.
[13:32.700 --> 13:36.320]  So that's where you get specific cut and specific cut names.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.840]  You may get regional cuts.
[13:37.840 --> 13:39.680]  You may get breeder cuts.
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.880]  Also dispensaries have very popular cuts of certain strains.
[13:44.880 --> 13:50.080]  There is a dispensary in Denver that grows the Lemon Jeffrey and they have got a very
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.780]  beautiful phenotype of the Lemon Jeffrey and they do offer clones of it on occasion.
[13:55.780 --> 13:58.980]  When you get those clones, you have got the Kind Love cut.
[13:58.980 --> 14:03.060]  So if you go to Kind Love, you get Lemon Jeffrey, you can call that the Kind Love cut.
[14:03.060 --> 14:04.540]  That is the one they run.
[14:04.540 --> 14:05.940]  That's the one that they share.
[14:06.060 --> 14:09.220]  They are known for that cut of that Lemon Jeffrey.
[14:09.220 --> 14:13.180]  So that's how these certain strains get their cut names or their sub names.
[14:13.180 --> 14:17.780]  They're either grown by a grower who is popular and they get the cut named after them, the
[14:17.780 --> 14:22.740]  Rasta Jeff cut, or it could be regional or it could just have some sort of a story behind
[14:22.740 --> 14:23.740]  it.
[14:23.740 --> 14:24.740]  That's also a popular thing.
[14:24.740 --> 14:31.440]  Another thing that happens is sometimes the breeders will identify specific phenotypes
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.360]  before the seeds are released and they will tell you to look for specific phenotypes within
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.360]  the batches.
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.780]  I am known for identifying phenotypes in my batches and I give very good descriptions
[14:42.780 --> 14:45.340]  of the phenotypes on some of my podcasts.
[14:45.340 --> 14:47.440]  I'm going to go off on a little mini rant here.
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.880]  I'm going to stop talking so much about desirable phenotypes because those are what are desirable
[14:53.880 --> 14:54.940]  to me.
[14:54.940 --> 14:59.760]  When you're growing a pack of seeds from seed, I feel like you should find the phenotype
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.840]  that is more desirable for you and your garden.
[15:03.840 --> 15:05.180]  Don't worry about what I said.
[15:05.180 --> 15:06.680]  You're growing it for you.
[15:06.680 --> 15:07.680]  Get what you like.
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.480]  I've got good recommendations, but sometimes I feel like when I start talking about phenotypes,
[15:12.480 --> 15:15.540]  I sway people's hunt and they don't get what they want.
[15:15.540 --> 15:18.660]  They get what I want and that's not why we're growing.
[15:18.660 --> 15:19.920]  That's not why we're pheno hunting.
[15:19.920 --> 15:24.240]  So I'm going to back off a little bit on some of my phenotype recommendations.
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.640]  I'll still make descriptions and things, but I'm not going to recommend.
[15:27.640 --> 15:29.380]  Sometimes I often say that one's the keeper.
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.660]  I may get away from doing that.
[15:30.660 --> 15:33.260]  I'll say the one you like the best is the keeper.
[15:33.260 --> 15:36.020]  So let me try to figure out where I was and get back on track.
[15:36.020 --> 15:40.260]  I was working my way into talking about a breeder who tells us about specific phenotypes
[15:40.260 --> 15:44.360]  of a specific strain and what I'm getting toward is Jilly Bean.
[15:44.360 --> 15:49.260]  When you buy Jilly Bean, we know that we can look for the candy store pheno and the orange
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.260]  pheno.
[15:50.260 --> 15:54.940]  Those are two very popular and very reliable phenotypes that will come out of a pack of
[15:54.940 --> 15:55.980]  Jilly Bean.
[15:55.980 --> 15:58.380]  So those are two very popular phenotypes.
[15:58.380 --> 16:02.080]  You always hear about the candy store Jill and the orange Jill.
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.980]  So that's basically what we mean when we say like basically a subtitle or a sub name to
[16:06.980 --> 16:07.980]  a strain.
[16:07.980 --> 16:09.340]  Like, Hey, I've got the Jilly Bean.
[16:09.340 --> 16:12.740]  And then your buddy will go, do you have the orange cut or the candy store cut?
[16:12.740 --> 16:14.060]  And you'll go, Oh.
[16:14.060 --> 16:17.980]  And then if you've got both of them, if you grow a pack of seeds, it's very likely you
[16:17.980 --> 16:20.620]  will get the candy store and the orange.
[16:20.620 --> 16:23.900]  And you won't know when you smell it, you'll go, Oh, that's obviously the candy store.
[16:23.900 --> 16:25.100]  Then you smell the other one.
[16:25.100 --> 16:28.540]  You go, Oh, that's obviously the orange dominant phenotype.
[16:28.540 --> 16:33.380]  So Jilly Bean is very well known for the orange and the candy store phenotype.
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.260]  That's where you start hearing those subtitles.
[16:35.260 --> 16:37.900]  I guess it is when we're talking about strain names.
[16:37.900 --> 16:41.620]  Now really quickly, I should cover land race genetics.
[16:41.620 --> 16:44.580]  I am not an expert when it comes to land races.
[16:44.580 --> 16:48.060]  I have always said that there are seed breeders and seed collectors.
[16:48.060 --> 16:54.700]  Then there is a sub culture of land race growers, breeders, and seed hoarders.
[16:54.700 --> 16:59.900]  They're kind of the subculture within the subculture, the extra nerdy among the nerdy.
[16:59.900 --> 17:02.980]  So my take on land races is essentially this.
[17:02.980 --> 17:08.420]  Land race seeds are seeds that are acquired from a region where the plants and the cannabis
[17:08.420 --> 17:13.580]  breeding has not been disrupted by selection from man.
[17:13.580 --> 17:17.940]  So if you think about in some places, they've got a large field of cannabis growing outdoors.
[17:17.940 --> 17:20.820]  They let the males and the females grow side by side.
[17:20.820 --> 17:23.340]  They do not remove the male plants.
[17:23.340 --> 17:27.000]  Those male plants open pollinate all of the females.
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.820]  As the plants are harvested, those seeds are dropped right back into the ground naturally,
[17:31.820 --> 17:36.540]  just from the plants being shaken by the harvest method, just by nature, just by being there,
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.420]  those seeds fall back into the ground.
[17:38.420 --> 17:41.460]  Then next year, those seeds grow up again.
[17:41.460 --> 17:43.500]  Male and female plants are allowed to grow.
[17:43.500 --> 17:45.380]  The males are not cold.
[17:45.380 --> 17:47.960]  Those males pollinate those females.
[17:47.960 --> 17:54.480]  So each female plant contains seeds from multiple male plants from that area.
[17:54.480 --> 18:00.160]  So this happens over generations, over generations without being adulterated by mankind.
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.320]  Nobody goes there and disrupts the breeding of these plants.
[18:03.320 --> 18:06.560]  The only thing that people are doing is removing the finished plants.
[18:06.560 --> 18:09.800]  We are allowing the seeds to fall and they're allowed to grow next year.
[18:09.800 --> 18:12.000]  We aren't doing any selection.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.600]  Nature is doing all of the selection here for these seeds.
[18:15.600 --> 18:20.600]  The plants that grow the best in that environment, they thrive and they live.
[18:20.600 --> 18:23.640]  Then those plants with survivor instincts get pollinated.
[18:23.640 --> 18:25.440]  The males get to shoot pollen.
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.180]  The future generations have those traits even more solidified.
[18:29.180 --> 18:35.160]  This has been happening for generations among generations without interruption of mankind.
[18:35.160 --> 18:37.040]  Those are land-race genetics.
[18:37.040 --> 18:40.840]  If you go to one of those regions and you acquire those seeds and you bring them back
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.800]  home, those seeds you acquired were land races.
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.120]  The minute you fuck with them, that offspring is no longer a land race.
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.920]  You can label it secret Tibetan mountain F2 or you can label it something like that, but
[18:52.920 --> 18:54.880]  you cannot call it a land race anymore.
[18:54.880 --> 18:57.000]  It has been adulterated by mankind.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  It has been worked.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.200]  It is no longer a land race worked by the land.
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.120]  There may be people who argue with my definition of what a land race is, but to my understanding,
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.580]  to my standards, that is what I would call a land race.
[19:10.580 --> 19:13.820]  that have been unadulterated by human interaction.
[19:13.820 --> 19:18.580]  They've been breeding and selecting themselves in nature in their own environment, and they
[19:18.580 --> 19:23.380]  have adjusted themselves to grow through evolution in their environment.
[19:23.380 --> 19:28.060]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[19:28.060 --> 19:33.020]  and growers, I hope you enjoyed my lesson on breeding talk in a little bit of glossary
[19:33.020 --> 19:34.020]  terms.
[19:34.020 --> 19:38.620]  If you have got any corrections or suggestions, I do encourage that type of growth.

[19:52.880 --> 19:58.600]  iReed Genetics has a booth at the Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado on January 25th and January
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.600]  26th.
[19:59.600 --> 20:02.160]  The 25th is business to business day.

[21:21.880 --> 21:23.600]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.160]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy James Butterson.
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.160]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[25:13.450 --> 25:24.610]  lier Every time I was below, you always grabbed
[25:24.610 --> 25:29.810]  my hand and then you held me up, nice and slow, triple slip for change, don't give me
[25:29.810 --> 25:32.810]  no hassle, all I want is love to share.
[25:32.810 --> 25:39.730]  Every time I was below, you always grabbed my hand and then you held me up, nice and
[25:39.730 --> 25:42.510]  slow, triple slip for change, don't give me no hassle, all I want is love to share.
