[00:03.770 --> 00:07.170]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:07.170 --> 00:09.090]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff,

[00:17.690 --> 00:20.290]  is going to join us to teach us about LED lighting.
[00:20.290 --> 00:21.930]  Before we get to that part of the show,
[00:21.930 --> 00:24.090]  let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:24.090 --> 00:25.890]  who support us on Patreon.

[00:50.690 --> 00:52.290]  with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[00:52.290 --> 00:54.730]  thank you shout out to Papa Roney.
[00:54.730 --> 00:56.890]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[00:56.890 --> 00:59.450]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[00:59.450 --> 01:01.130]  If you are not already supporting the show
[01:01.130 --> 01:02.810]  and you'd like to learn how to do so,
[01:03.370 --> 01:06.850]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com

[01:08.610 --> 01:09.850]  All of the information you need
[01:09.850 --> 01:11.290]  is right there on the screen.
[01:11.290 --> 01:13.810]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes
[01:13.810 --> 01:16.610]  and in the video description to make it nice and easy
[01:16.610 --> 01:18.650]  for all of my friends.
[01:18.650 --> 01:21.490]  All right, I'm sure you are excited about this LED lesson.
[01:21.490 --> 01:22.970]  I don't wanna waste too much time.
[01:22.970 --> 01:25.370]  So I'm going to fade out the music, fade out the video.
[01:25.370 --> 01:28.130]  And when we get back, I will be joined by my friend Keith
[01:28.130 --> 01:29.570]  from Black Sale Market.
[01:30.930 --> 01:31.770]  All right, here we go.
[01:31.770 --> 01:32.610]  What's up podcast world?
[01:33.410 --> 01:34.250]  We are back.
[01:34.250 --> 01:35.650]  We've got my buddy Keith joining us from Black Sale Market.
[01:35.650 --> 01:37.250]  Welcome to the show, Keith.
[01:37.250 --> 01:39.770]  Hey bro, thank you so much for having me.
[01:39.770 --> 01:40.930]  Oh dude, thanks for joining us.
[01:40.930 --> 01:42.530]  I do appreciate you being here.
[01:42.530 --> 01:43.930]  Before we go too far on the show,
[01:43.930 --> 01:45.730]  do you wanna tell people how they can stalk you
[01:45.730 --> 01:49.210]  on social media and maybe how they can find your website?
[01:49.210 --> 01:51.450]  Oh yeah, absolutely man.
[01:51.450 --> 01:53.130]  Well, first of all, my name's Keith
[01:53.130 --> 01:58.130]  and I'm the owner, founder, CEO, HMFIC
[01:58.970 --> 02:03.610]  of one of the most badass LED companies in the world
[02:03.610 --> 02:05.210]  called blacksalemarket.com.
[02:05.210 --> 02:07.850]  But yeah, you can find blacksalemarket.com
[02:07.850 --> 02:10.690]  on Instagram or cannabose at blacksalemarket.
[02:10.690 --> 02:13.290]  And then every Thursday night,
[02:13.290 --> 02:17.410]  I'm now co-hosting the Embracing Organics show on YouTube.
[02:17.410 --> 02:19.010]  Excellent, I was gonna give you a big shout out
[02:19.010 --> 02:21.130]  and a big thank you for co-hosting EO.
[02:21.130 --> 02:23.170]  I've been a part of the show.
[02:23.170 --> 02:25.010]  I don't think I'm like the host
[02:25.010 --> 02:26.450]  or I'm a panelist on the show.
[02:26.490 --> 02:28.730]  I've been involved with the show for quite a while
[02:28.730 --> 02:30.530]  and to watch the changes happen,
[02:30.530 --> 02:32.850]  I'm proud of the people who have picked it up
[02:32.850 --> 02:35.890]  and who are continuing the torch and keeping the show.
[02:35.890 --> 02:37.610]  I do see changes and improvements coming.
[02:37.610 --> 02:38.450]  So I'm proud of you, bro.
[02:38.450 --> 02:39.650]  Thank you for keeping that going.
[02:39.650 --> 02:41.130]  I do see you stepping up.
[02:41.130 --> 02:43.810]  In the chat we have, I see you trying to kind of be a leader
[02:43.810 --> 02:45.530]  and I appreciate it, thank you.
[02:45.530 --> 02:46.370]  Thank you, man.
[02:46.370 --> 02:49.850]  Yeah, and Tenasi and Hempire Dave
[02:49.850 --> 02:51.730]  are also really doing their big part
[02:51.730 --> 02:53.730]  and also everybody else on the panel.
[02:54.690 --> 02:56.650]  We lost Dirtman Dan.
[02:56.650 --> 02:58.890]  He just had some important life shit
[02:58.890 --> 03:00.010]  that we had to take care of.
[03:00.010 --> 03:02.970]  So somebody had to step up and keep the show going.
[03:02.970 --> 03:03.810]  Like the question was,
[03:03.810 --> 03:05.930]  are we gonna have an episode this week?
[03:05.930 --> 03:07.690]  And that first week I was like,
[03:07.690 --> 03:10.170]  yeah, yeah, fuck yeah, we're gonna have an episode.
[03:10.170 --> 03:12.810]  I don't care if nobody else shows up.
[03:12.810 --> 03:15.730]  And actually, if you guys feel like watching
[03:15.730 --> 03:17.290]  a train wreck in slow motion,
[03:17.290 --> 03:19.770]  me and RJ picked that show up.
[03:19.770 --> 03:22.170]  And I was really happy when Jeff showed up
[03:22.370 --> 03:24.490]  because I was about ready to just do the damn thing
[03:24.490 --> 03:25.770]  on my own.
[03:25.770 --> 03:27.130]  Yeah, I got your back, bro.
[03:27.130 --> 03:27.970]  Thank you, man.
[03:27.970 --> 03:29.970]  But yeah, we've had three weeks to work on it
[03:29.970 --> 03:31.850]  and we're coming up with a format.
[03:31.850 --> 03:36.850]  And we wanna keep the show the same kind of fun hangout,
[03:37.050 --> 03:39.130]  shoot the shit that it's always been
[03:39.130 --> 03:43.130]  and just give it a little more structure, you know?
[03:43.130 --> 03:46.730]  And try to have everybody be a little bit more prepared.
[03:48.810 --> 03:50.730]  And that way it's really easy to get still
[03:50.770 --> 03:54.050]  on this fucking talk if you've got some notes prepared.
[03:54.050 --> 03:54.890]  Exactly, yeah.
[03:54.890 --> 03:55.930]  Have a few bullet points
[03:55.930 --> 03:58.010]  and just stumble right on down the list.
[03:58.010 --> 03:59.730]  I think you guys are doing a great job.
[03:59.730 --> 04:00.730]  Not to just single you out,
[04:00.730 --> 04:04.530]  but big shout out to Tenasi and of course, Empire Dave.
[04:04.530 --> 04:06.050]  Big respect to everybody doing it.
[04:06.050 --> 04:07.730]  But yeah, man, I love that you guys are stepping up
[04:07.730 --> 04:08.570]  and keeping it going.
[04:08.570 --> 04:10.650]  Because when I heard that Dan had to step down,
[04:10.650 --> 04:12.210]  I was like, oh, there goes a great show.
[04:12.210 --> 04:13.610]  Because you guys have a beautiful audience
[04:13.610 --> 04:14.930]  and a great community.
[04:14.930 --> 04:18.170]  So it's been heartbreaking to watch that go away.
[04:18.170 --> 04:19.010]  So thank you, bro.
[04:19.010 --> 04:19.850]  I do appreciate that.
[04:19.890 --> 04:22.090]  Make sure you check out Embracing Organics.
[04:22.090 --> 04:23.410]  It is Thursday nights.

[04:24.530 --> 04:27.170]  So for me, it is 7 p.m. Mountain Time.
[04:27.170 --> 04:29.410]  They go for about two hours.
[04:29.410 --> 04:30.250]  Join the party.
[04:30.250 --> 04:31.090]  It's on YouTube.
[04:31.090 --> 04:32.290]  Just search for Embracing Organics.
[04:32.290 --> 04:34.850]  If you missed the live show, it is all up there forever.

[04:38.250 --> 04:39.930]  three years worth of episodes.
[04:39.930 --> 04:41.650]  Quite a few episodes up there.
[04:41.650 --> 04:43.730]  You can see the show where Keith and I
[04:43.730 --> 04:46.290]  kind of pulled one off and just put it together real quick.
[04:46.290 --> 04:49.130]  Or you can see some shows with a lot of great guests.
[04:49.130 --> 04:50.890]  We've had a lot of cool people on there.
[04:50.890 --> 04:52.970]  Kevin Jodry, Coot's been on there.
[04:52.970 --> 04:54.370]  A lot of great breeders.
[04:54.370 --> 04:55.330]  A lot of great people.
[04:55.330 --> 04:57.610]  So check it out, you guys, Embracing Organics.
[04:57.610 --> 04:59.090]  Let's talk more about my podcast
[04:59.090 --> 05:01.170]  since we got you on my show, bro.
[05:01.170 --> 05:04.130]  I love it that your light is called the Canon.
[05:04.130 --> 05:05.570]  It fits perfectly.
[05:05.570 --> 05:07.610]  I switched to using Canons.
[05:07.610 --> 05:10.970]  I went from HPS lights to Canons, and I love it.
[05:10.970 --> 05:12.690]  So I think calling it a Canon is perfect
[05:12.690 --> 05:15.010]  because the first time I plugged it in, dude,
[05:15.010 --> 05:17.650]  I looked away like, oh no, I blinked.
[05:17.650 --> 05:18.610]  I put my hands up.
[05:18.610 --> 05:20.450]  I felt like I was getting assaulted by light.
[05:20.450 --> 05:21.290]  So it's a Canon, dude.
[05:21.290 --> 05:23.090]  I got shot in the face with so much light
[05:23.090 --> 05:24.490]  the first time I plugged it in.
[05:24.490 --> 05:25.530]  I did not expect that.
[05:25.530 --> 05:27.810]  I knew it would be bright, but it was like,
[05:27.810 --> 05:31.770]  oh, it was offensive and assaulting, and it's amazing.
[05:31.770 --> 05:33.850]  So I've gushed enough about your lights.
[05:33.850 --> 05:35.010]  You guys use more argh.
[05:35.010 --> 05:37.650]  Yeah, that's what the light guy did.
[05:37.650 --> 05:39.170]  He's like, argh, and he got me with the light
[05:39.170 --> 05:40.330]  and then he pirated me.
[05:41.330 --> 05:42.570]  So I love the lights.
[05:42.570 --> 05:45.010]  I've seen a lot of great performance from my lights.
[05:45.010 --> 05:46.490]  I know what my plants are doing,
[05:46.490 --> 05:49.170]  but I don't know that I understand why.
[05:49.170 --> 05:52.730]  So I brought you on to kind of teach me about my new lights,
[05:52.730 --> 05:55.610]  let you teach the audience about LED lights.
[05:55.610 --> 05:57.810]  I'll let you kind of teach me the basics.
[05:57.810 --> 05:59.410]  You always talk about the McCree curve
[05:59.410 --> 06:01.290]  and you talk about a lot of scientific stuff
[06:01.290 --> 06:03.090]  that honestly, when it comes to growing,
[06:03.090 --> 06:04.810]  I understand the plants like they're people.
[06:04.810 --> 06:06.370]  I talk to the plants like they're people.
[06:06.370 --> 06:08.410]  I pet them like they're pets and animals.
[06:08.410 --> 06:10.050]  When it comes to lights,
[06:10.050 --> 06:13.290]  that is where I lack the most info.
[06:13.290 --> 06:16.610]  My brain simply doesn't, it doesn't care.
[06:16.610 --> 06:18.170]  Like no offense to the light thing.
[06:18.170 --> 06:20.130]  I care about the plants, the nutrients, the water.
[06:20.130 --> 06:21.330]  I could see that.
[06:21.330 --> 06:23.050]  The numbers and those charts and things,
[06:23.050 --> 06:24.330]  my brain goes, what?
[06:24.330 --> 06:25.970]  I don't want to know that.
[06:25.970 --> 06:27.810]  So I've got some light ignorance
[06:27.810 --> 06:29.850]  and some light ADD, I guess.
[06:29.850 --> 06:32.930]  So I think you can teach me in a great way
[06:32.930 --> 06:33.770]  to understand light.
[06:33.770 --> 06:34.770]  So I'm gonna quit rambling
[06:34.770 --> 06:36.410]  and I'm gonna give you the opportunity
[06:36.410 --> 06:38.290]  to teach me about LEDs.
[06:38.290 --> 06:40.610]  So you talk about the McCree curve
[06:40.610 --> 06:41.930]  and you talk about LEDs.
[06:41.930 --> 06:43.010]  Where should you start, bro?
[06:43.690 --> 06:44.890]  What would you want to teach me first?
[06:46.330 --> 06:47.170]  Yeah, man.
[06:47.170 --> 06:48.330]  I mean, there's really,
[06:48.330 --> 06:50.570]  there's a lot of different like terms
[06:50.570 --> 06:52.770]  and numbers to kind of get used to.
[06:52.770 --> 06:54.170]  But there's really, as a grower,
[06:54.170 --> 06:55.730]  there's only like two or three things
[06:55.730 --> 06:56.890]  that you have to know.
[06:58.050 --> 07:00.010]  And I would probably,
[07:00.010 --> 07:02.810]  I'll probably start off explaining spectrum
[07:02.810 --> 07:05.410]  and color temperatures and all that
[07:05.410 --> 07:08.930]  because that's what everybody wants to hear about.
[07:10.450 --> 07:12.050]  Everybody's hard for that shit.
[07:12.050 --> 07:15.410]  So that's where we're gonna begin.
[07:15.410 --> 07:16.730]  Excellent.
[07:16.730 --> 07:19.170]  So let's figure out spectrum real quick.
[07:19.170 --> 07:20.570]  I'm gonna share my screen
[07:21.850 --> 07:24.690]  and get started here.
[07:24.690 --> 07:25.530]  Cool.
[07:25.530 --> 07:30.090]  So all white light is composed
[07:30.090 --> 07:34.170]  of all the different colors of light.
[07:35.650 --> 07:37.610]  And they all mix together to make white.
[07:37.610 --> 07:40.530]  And then if you run white light through a prism,
[07:40.530 --> 07:43.570]  it breaks up into a beautiful rainbow.
[07:43.570 --> 07:46.410]  So all the visible colors of light are there,
[07:46.410 --> 07:49.450]  you know, from purple and violet up into blue,
[07:49.450 --> 07:52.010]  green, yellow, and orange, red.
[07:52.010 --> 07:54.690]  And they're all there in different amounts.
[07:54.690 --> 07:56.610]  You know, so you can look at like the light bulbs
[07:56.610 --> 07:57.970]  in your house and see like,
[07:57.970 --> 07:59.650]  oh, this one's got a little bit more
[07:59.650 --> 08:01.330]  of like an orange and yellow in it.
[08:01.330 --> 08:03.850]  And then I turn on the fluorescent light in my kitchen
[08:03.850 --> 08:07.330]  and see like this one has a higher proportion of blue.
[08:07.330 --> 08:08.810]  They're all mixed in there together,
[08:08.850 --> 08:10.770]  but they're all in different amounts
[08:10.770 --> 08:11.970]  and that's white light.
[08:14.570 --> 08:16.490]  So that leaves us with the question of
[08:18.490 --> 08:21.810]  what amount of each color do we want to use
[08:21.810 --> 08:23.770]  in our igloo or gardens?
[08:23.770 --> 08:27.570]  And that question luckily has an answer
[08:27.570 --> 08:31.170]  and it's had an answer for a really long time.
[08:31.170 --> 08:36.170]  And that answer is specific to cannabis.
[08:37.010 --> 08:40.490]  Sorry, let me get this slideshow working again.
[08:42.490 --> 08:43.410]  There you go.
[08:43.410 --> 08:44.530]  There we go.
[08:44.530 --> 08:49.530]  So this guy, Dr. McCree, I assumed he was a doctor.
[08:50.530 --> 08:52.290]  Maybe he was just really smart,
[08:53.690 --> 08:56.330]  but he went through in the 80s
[08:56.330 --> 08:59.650]  and tested each different color of light
[08:59.650 --> 09:03.530]  on a bunch of different plants, including cannabis.
[09:03.530 --> 09:05.730]  So he must've been pretty fucking cool.
[09:07.170 --> 09:10.330]  And like, you can see the rainbow in here,
[09:10.330 --> 09:12.650]  right over here at the left end, you've got violet.
[09:12.650 --> 09:16.130]  It comes in through the blue to the green and to the red.
[09:16.130 --> 09:19.410]  And when McCree started testing out
[09:19.410 --> 09:20.890]  different colors of light,
[09:20.890 --> 09:22.650]  he found out that red was the jam
[09:22.650 --> 09:25.970]  and it works at 100% relative efficiency.
[09:25.970 --> 09:29.170]  And then you got blue coming in around 80%
[09:29.170 --> 09:32.090]  and green coming in around 60%.
[09:33.090 --> 09:35.250]  So yeah, this is the PAR curve
[09:35.250 --> 09:38.210]  and it's based on the McCree curve for cannabis.
[09:38.210 --> 09:41.730]  And this is kind of, if you ever hear the term PAR,
[09:43.130 --> 09:46.690]  it stands for photosynthetically active radiation,
[09:46.690 --> 09:48.970]  which is just a fancy way of saying light.
[09:51.450 --> 09:53.610]  It's not one of like the three things
[09:53.610 --> 09:55.210]  that you really need to memorize.
[09:55.210 --> 09:57.090]  We'll get to those.
[09:57.090 --> 09:59.530]  This is all just kind of background information.
[10:00.530 --> 10:03.850]  So far I see that plants don't really care
[10:03.850 --> 10:05.650]  for this green and yellow stuff,
[10:05.650 --> 10:07.610]  but they're loving the reds and they're loving,
[10:07.610 --> 10:08.850]  they're liking the blues.
[10:08.850 --> 10:09.690]  Is that correct?
[10:10.930 --> 10:11.770]  Yeah, man.
[10:11.770 --> 10:16.290]  I mean, honestly, I think that matching this curve
[10:16.290 --> 10:19.530]  is gonna give you superior plant health.
[10:20.450 --> 10:22.450]  I'll get to that in a second, but-
[10:22.450 --> 10:23.290]  All right.
[10:23.290 --> 10:25.330]  I just wanted to make sure I'm following along correctly.
[10:25.330 --> 10:27.330]  Yeah, and people have tried to,
[10:27.370 --> 10:29.370]  those are those blurple LEDs
[10:29.370 --> 10:31.570]  that they're still on the market.
[10:33.570 --> 10:36.650]  Unfortunately, the single color red and blue diodes
[10:36.650 --> 10:38.090]  are really expensive.
[10:38.090 --> 10:43.090]  So it's not really advantageous to just have red and blue.
[10:43.250 --> 10:45.290]  Like you want like a full spectrum white light
[10:45.290 --> 10:46.730]  that also includes green.
[10:47.690 --> 10:51.810]  And the first blurple lights were invented by NASA
[10:51.810 --> 10:53.450]  so that they could grow lettuce
[10:53.450 --> 10:56.010]  and they could grow lettuce in the greenhouse.
[10:56.010 --> 10:57.410]  So they could grow lettuce
[10:57.410 --> 10:59.850]  on the International Space Station.
[10:59.850 --> 11:00.690]  Cool.
[11:00.690 --> 11:01.970]  And they just wanted the red and blue
[11:01.970 --> 11:03.250]  because when you're,
[11:03.250 --> 11:05.210]  I guess when you're in fucking outer space,
[11:05.210 --> 11:06.970]  like every watt count,
[11:06.970 --> 11:10.490]  like they're like PhDs trying to save
[11:10.490 --> 11:13.010]  like every tiny little scrap of electricity
[11:14.050 --> 11:16.090]  cause they're in fucking space.
[11:16.090 --> 11:17.370]  Yeah.
[11:17.370 --> 11:19.570]  So then you would, yeah, you would just use red and blue
[11:19.570 --> 11:21.610]  cause they are the most efficient.
[11:21.650 --> 11:26.650]  But besides just the efficiency of driving photosynthesis,
[11:27.050 --> 11:31.170]  there's the plant response
[11:32.370 --> 11:36.970]  that is kind of like a separate factor, you know?
[11:36.970 --> 11:39.410]  So you might think you want to use all red
[11:39.410 --> 11:42.410]  but you would actually end up with a fucked up plant.
[11:42.410 --> 11:43.250]  Okay.
[11:43.250 --> 11:45.130]  And the plants are the boss.
[11:45.130 --> 11:46.690]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:47.650 --> 11:48.490]  All right.
[11:48.490 --> 11:53.290]  So superimposed on the power graph now,
[11:53.290 --> 11:56.690]  we've got kind of the spectrum graphs
[11:56.690 --> 12:00.850]  of different colored LED grow lights
[12:00.850 --> 12:03.090]  and also HPS lights.
[12:04.330 --> 12:13.420]  So I really liked the 3,500 K color temperature.
[12:14.260 --> 12:15.220]  It's my favorite.
[12:15.220 --> 12:17.980]  That's what all my lights have always come standard in.
[12:18.580 --> 12:21.060]  I only recently started offering
[12:21.060 --> 12:24.860]  the 3,000 K color temperature as like an option.
[12:25.740 --> 12:26.740]  Okay.
[12:26.740 --> 12:29.340]  Because I think 3,500 K is perfect.
[12:29.340 --> 12:30.180]  And-
[12:30.180 --> 12:31.820]  Yeah, on that graph, it looks great.
[12:31.820 --> 12:32.660]  Right, yeah.
[12:32.660 --> 12:33.500]  It's the green one.
[12:33.500 --> 12:35.980]  And it just almost perfectly matches
[12:35.980 --> 12:40.980]  that ideal spectrum graph for cannabis, you know?
[12:41.940 --> 12:46.380]  So you get really healthy looking, short,
[12:46.420 --> 12:50.740]  bushy plants with fucking dense, frosty nubs.
[12:50.740 --> 12:51.580]  Yeah.
[12:51.580 --> 12:53.140]  You got huge praying leaves,
[12:53.140 --> 12:55.140]  they're pointing straight up.
[12:55.140 --> 12:57.180]  The plants just love it, man.
[12:57.180 --> 12:58.060]  They do.
[12:58.060 --> 12:58.900]  They really do.
[12:58.900 --> 12:59.980]  And I'm not just trying to, you know,
[12:59.980 --> 13:01.620]  just cause I use the lights and cause you're my bro,
[13:01.620 --> 13:02.460]  they do love it.
[13:02.460 --> 13:04.340]  I see huge differences in my plants.
[13:04.340 --> 13:06.420]  I kind of had to relearn how to grow.
[13:06.420 --> 13:08.420]  My nutrients are different.
[13:08.420 --> 13:09.660]  My environment is different.
[13:09.660 --> 13:11.780]  It was a big adjustment and the plants are happier.
[13:11.780 --> 13:13.060]  They're much happier.
[13:13.060 --> 13:15.860]  So yeah, I do see a huge difference in the performance.
[13:16.420 --> 13:17.340]  Definitely, man.
[13:17.340 --> 13:19.780]  That's why I think it's really best to get
[13:19.780 --> 13:22.860]  that proper balance between red and blue
[13:22.860 --> 13:24.780]  and stick with it.
[13:24.780 --> 13:29.100]  You know, 3,500K and also 3,000K is a little bit more red,
[13:31.540 --> 13:34.460]  but it's still also very close.
[13:34.460 --> 13:38.100]  So with 3,500K, you're gonna get a little bit shorter
[13:38.100 --> 13:43.100]  inner nodes and potentially some frostier plants and flower.
[13:44.620 --> 13:45.460]  Okay.
[13:45.500 --> 13:48.020]  With 3,000K, your nodes might be a little bit longer
[13:48.020 --> 13:50.500]  and you're potentially gonna get some bigger yields
[13:50.500 --> 13:52.980]  in flower, you know?
[13:52.980 --> 13:54.020]  All right.
[13:54.020 --> 13:54.860]  Yeah.
[13:54.860 --> 13:56.500]  I'm used to, I'm the old school grower.
[13:56.500 --> 13:59.220]  I'm used to switching from the halides to the HBS
[13:59.220 --> 14:00.940]  as I switch into flower.
[14:00.940 --> 14:03.260]  Do I still wanna stick with my same LED light
[14:03.260 --> 14:05.780]  and just keep my cannons up the whole time?
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.420]  Or are you gonna start giving me veg lights
[14:07.420 --> 14:09.340]  and flowering lights?
[14:09.340 --> 14:14.340]  Honestly, man, the differences between 3,500 Kelvin
[14:14.460 --> 14:17.940]  and 3,000 Kelvin are gonna be very subtle.
[14:17.940 --> 14:21.900]  And the last thing I wanted to say about spectrum
[14:21.900 --> 14:24.740]  was to stop fucking worrying about spectrum
[14:24.740 --> 14:29.740]  because it's really not that important.
[14:31.300 --> 14:35.100]  If you just, one of the two things you need to remember
[14:35.100 --> 14:40.100]  about LEDs is to get 3,500K or 3,000K
[14:40.140 --> 14:42.060]  for your color temperature.
[14:42.060 --> 14:44.300]  I don't know what a Kelvin is.
[14:45.140 --> 14:47.340]  I don't know why it's 3,000.
[14:47.340 --> 14:52.340]  I just know that like 3,000 is a little more red.
[14:52.620 --> 14:55.540]  3,500 has a little bit more blue.
[14:55.540 --> 14:59.580]  And I think 3,500 has the best balance of red and blue
[14:59.580 --> 15:00.820]  for full cycle.
[15:01.660 --> 15:03.460]  And it's my favorite.
[15:05.580 --> 15:07.500]  If you're really just focused on flower,
[15:07.500 --> 15:09.780]  if you're never gonna veg with this light,
[15:09.780 --> 15:12.340]  sometimes people like to get the 3,000 Kelvin
[15:12.340 --> 15:14.180]  if they're a little bit more focused
[15:14.180 --> 15:16.340]  on trying to get the best yield they can.
[15:17.300 --> 15:18.780]  You do have a good reason to believe
[15:18.780 --> 15:21.220]  you might get a slightly higher yield with 3,000
[15:21.220 --> 15:23.780]  because you've got a little bit more red in there.
[15:25.260 --> 15:28.740]  But the other important thing about your red and blue balance
[15:28.740 --> 15:31.060]  is that it determines the height of the plant.
[15:32.460 --> 15:35.380]  And that's really the important thing with spectrum
[15:35.380 --> 15:39.180]  is that it's gonna determine the height of the plant.
[15:39.180 --> 15:42.500]  Like if you look at...
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.400]  One thing I've noticed is my plants are much bushier,
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.160]  tighter, tighter internode spacing, squattier.
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.600]  They don't stretch nearly as much.
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.680]  And that transition, the three weeks from veg to flower,
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.360]  I was used to my plants taking off.
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.880]  I could have vegged for another week
[16:04.880 --> 16:08.000]  because they didn't go as hard as I'm used to with the LEDs.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.760]  So that was advantageous for sure.
[16:10.600 --> 16:11.960]  Yeah, man.
[16:11.960 --> 16:13.000]  Well, what I was...
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.520]  Hang on, what I was gonna show you was that you went...
[16:20.600 --> 16:22.080]  Okay, so what I wanted to show you
[16:22.080 --> 16:25.160]  was how you went from a high pressure sodium
[16:25.160 --> 16:27.520]  to a 3,500 K LED.
[16:29.000 --> 16:29.960]  Oh, I was missing a lot.
[16:29.960 --> 16:31.440]  I wasn't getting any of that blue
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.440]  and I was missing the peak red part.
[16:33.440 --> 16:35.880]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[16:35.880 --> 16:37.760]  Yeah, look at that HPS spectrum, man.
[16:37.760 --> 16:40.480]  That yellow, orange color should be very familiar.
[16:42.200 --> 16:43.960]  Yeah, that's what the room looks like.
[16:43.960 --> 16:46.680]  Right, so this goes to show you two things
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.480]  that if you're really heavy on red
[16:48.480 --> 16:50.320]  without the blue to balance it out,
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.040]  you're gonna get taller plants.
[16:53.880 --> 16:56.160]  So it kind of illustrates it right there.
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.960]  And then it does also show you
[17:01.120 --> 17:03.400]  kind of how like spectrum really has
[17:03.400 --> 17:05.480]  a limited impact on the plant.
[17:05.800 --> 17:07.920]  Because I mean, we've been growing really dank shit
[17:07.920 --> 17:10.600]  with high pressure sodium for decades.
[17:10.600 --> 17:13.360]  And if you look at it compared to the McCree curve,
[17:13.360 --> 17:15.560]  I mean, that spectrum's kind of fucked up.
[17:15.560 --> 17:16.840]  And there's a really big difference
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.720]  between an HPS and a full spectrum LED.
[17:21.720 --> 17:25.040]  But the plants still grow great under HPS.
[17:25.040 --> 17:28.320]  Like you still get frosty nugs and big yields.
[17:28.320 --> 17:30.000]  It's just, they're a bit taller.
[17:32.320 --> 17:34.480]  So that's really the only major difference
[17:34.520 --> 17:36.480]  that you're gonna be seeing.
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.800]  I think they eat better.
[17:37.800 --> 17:39.440]  I think since we're giving them
[17:40.400 --> 17:42.040]  the things they want spectrum wise,
[17:42.040 --> 17:44.360]  they're able to photosynthesize and metabolize
[17:44.360 --> 17:46.360]  and process the food better.
[17:46.360 --> 17:48.840]  I had to up some nutrients and I had to lower some
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.480]  because they didn't need some nutrients
[17:50.480 --> 17:52.720]  because they were getting fed enough of the other things.
[17:52.720 --> 17:54.520]  I had to kind of adjust a little bit.
[17:54.520 --> 17:55.600]  So I think the plants are just,
[17:55.600 --> 17:57.960]  they're happier with the LED.
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.800]  I just think it's closer to what they,
[17:59.800 --> 18:01.560]  by looking at the graph, it tells me for sure,
[18:01.560 --> 18:04.040]  it's closer to what they actually wanted.
[18:04.040 --> 18:04.880]  Right.
[18:05.880 --> 18:06.800]  Yeah, no, totally.
[18:06.800 --> 18:08.440]  It's almost dead on.
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.520]  And it's so close that you really don't need to,
[18:15.640 --> 18:19.280]  like I've tried all the different like spectrums combined.
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.280]  I've tried like supplementing reds and blues
[18:22.280 --> 18:23.400]  and all that different stuff
[18:23.400 --> 18:25.400]  and mix them all together in crazy ways.
[18:25.400 --> 18:28.520]  And honestly, I've never seen anything work much better
[18:28.520 --> 18:32.080]  than 3,500K or 3,000K just on its own.
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.560]  You know, if you've got the extra money
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.240]  and the extra time, you can have fun doing that,
[18:38.240 --> 18:40.280]  you know, and mixing in a bunch of little tiny
[18:40.280 --> 18:41.720]  different colors and stuff
[18:41.720 --> 18:43.600]  and your light's gonna look like a spaceship.
[18:43.600 --> 18:44.440]  It's fucking cool.
[18:44.440 --> 18:46.080]  Fun, yeah.
[18:46.080 --> 18:48.160]  But if you want to get the job done,
[18:49.880 --> 18:50.720]  you know what I mean?
[18:50.720 --> 18:52.880]  Yeah, until the aliens come and give us new technology.
[18:52.880 --> 18:56.040]  This is probably, I'm really happy with my LEDs.
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.240]  I've said it before on shows,
[18:57.240 --> 18:58.960]  but I don't know if I've told you this.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.720]  The seeds I made under LED lights
[19:01.720 --> 19:03.840]  are the best seeds I've ever made.
[19:03.840 --> 19:06.280]  I've been making seeds for years, countless years.
[19:06.280 --> 19:08.880]  I can't even remember when I started making seeds.
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.040]  And when I used LEDs, my seeds were bigger, harder, fatter,
[19:13.040 --> 19:15.080]  healthier, better germination rate,
[19:15.080 --> 19:16.800]  more viable seeds per batch.
[19:16.800 --> 19:18.880]  Sometimes you get those like white seeds
[19:18.880 --> 19:19.840]  at the bottom of the plant
[19:19.840 --> 19:22.240]  or seeds that just didn't quite get what they needed.
[19:22.240 --> 19:24.680]  I had way less of those more usable seeds
[19:24.680 --> 19:27.520]  in this last harvest, all grown under LED.
[19:27.520 --> 19:29.560]  And that tells me that the plants are just healthier.
[19:29.560 --> 19:30.680]  There's just something naturally
[19:30.680 --> 19:32.120]  is happier about that plant.
[19:33.040 --> 19:35.120]  Yeah, no, definitely, man.
[19:35.120 --> 19:36.960]  I've heard that from a couple other breeders.
[19:36.960 --> 19:38.800]  I think that's awesome.
[19:38.800 --> 19:40.880]  I never would have known that if it weren't for you guys
[19:40.880 --> 19:42.800]  because I never grow any seeds.
[19:42.800 --> 19:44.040]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.760]  Yeah, man, that's why I really,
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.480]  I've been growing with these lights for years, man.
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.400]  I really think the best thing to do
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.240]  is to find that proper balance
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.040]  and to stick as close as possible
[19:57.560 --> 19:59.760]  to what the plant really says it wants.
[19:59.760 --> 20:00.600]  Yeah.
[20:00.600 --> 20:01.440]  And then just-
[20:01.440 --> 20:02.400]  The plants are the boss.
[20:02.400 --> 20:04.480]  Yeah, it's just an overall health thing.
[20:04.480 --> 20:07.440]  And if they're happy, bro, you know it.
[20:07.440 --> 20:09.680]  Oh yeah, they will clap their hands, bro.
[20:09.680 --> 20:11.240]  They will clap their hands.
[20:11.240 --> 20:12.320]  Yeah.
[20:12.320 --> 20:14.440]  I've got questions, but I don't wanna derail you too much.
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.840]  So let me keep you focused on your beautiful presentation.
[20:17.840 --> 20:19.080]  Where are you headed next for me, buddy?
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.880]  Because I don't wanna throw you off.
[20:21.840 --> 20:23.760]  I just wanted to,
[20:23.760 --> 20:26.840]  there was like one other thing I wanted to say.
[20:27.640 --> 20:28.480]  I wanted to show you guys
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.200]  the 5,000 Kelvin color temperature.
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.080]  And that one, I've grown with it,
[20:36.080 --> 20:38.400]  and it's just a little too blue.
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.120]  It seems to be slowing down growth rates at that point.
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.520]  And also your nodes are just so stacked, dude.
[20:46.520 --> 20:49.840]  Like they're just right on top of each other.
[20:49.840 --> 20:53.240]  And you end up having to do like a lot of selective
[20:54.160 --> 20:55.280]  pruning of side branch.
[20:55.280 --> 20:56.120]  Oh yeah.
[20:56.160 --> 21:00.240]  So there is such a thing as like too short.
[21:00.240 --> 21:02.360]  Oh yeah, and too tight, too squatty.
[21:02.360 --> 21:04.080]  That does become a problem, yeah.
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.080]  Right.
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.840]  Is there a 4,200 Kelvin?
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.160]  Is that a thing I can find and buy?
[21:09.160 --> 21:11.200]  There is a 4,000 Kelvin,
[21:12.200 --> 21:14.480]  but yeah, you could buy it.
[21:14.480 --> 21:17.240]  But honestly, like I wouldn't recommend it.
[21:18.560 --> 21:21.040]  I think 3,500 is pretty great.
[21:21.040 --> 21:23.000]  I mean, that's what you're using.
[21:23.000 --> 21:23.840]  I don't know.
[21:23.880 --> 21:26.400]  Would you want your nodes to be any shorter?
[21:26.400 --> 21:28.840]  No, no, no, they're beautiful.
[21:28.840 --> 21:31.520]  If they get any tighter, it'll be problematic on some plants.
[21:31.520 --> 21:33.400]  It would definitely make a difference.
[21:33.400 --> 21:34.680]  Yeah, and I've talked about,
[21:34.680 --> 21:37.240]  I may have selected different plants
[21:37.240 --> 21:39.640]  from my Pheno selections in the past.
[21:39.640 --> 21:42.560]  I may have chosen different stuff because of these lights.
[21:42.560 --> 21:43.960]  Like they were growing, they were stretching,
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.120]  and the plants were different shapes
[21:45.120 --> 21:47.640]  because they were under HBS, not under LEDs,
[21:47.640 --> 21:49.440]  and the plants perform completely differently.
[21:49.440 --> 21:51.400]  And I'm like, oh, I should have gotten rid of that
[21:51.400 --> 21:52.920]  and kept that stretchy Pheno,
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.560]  because under this light, it would have been perfect,
[21:54.560 --> 21:56.440]  but it was too tall, so I tossed it.
[21:56.440 --> 22:00.120]  Yeah, it probably would have changed my selections for sure.
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.720]  Yeah, man, it'll have a big effect on plant height,
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.600]  and then really minor effects in other places, you know?
[22:08.600 --> 22:09.920]  Yeah.
[22:09.920 --> 22:12.680]  So I think the frost level is there too.
[22:12.680 --> 22:14.960]  The resin, the trichome development, it is there.
[22:14.960 --> 22:15.880]  And you can see it early.
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.920]  I think it comes on early.
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.320]  Definitely.
[22:19.320 --> 22:20.200]  All right.
[22:20.200 --> 22:22.640]  Well, actually, I've never grown with HBS,
[22:22.640 --> 22:24.520]  so I never had anything to compare it to.
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.400]  I grew with metal halide back in the day.
[22:28.440 --> 22:30.480]  Old school, old school.
[22:30.480 --> 22:31.800]  We all talk about those.
[22:31.800 --> 22:33.520]  But metal halide is some foxy shit, man.
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.560]  Yeah, it did a good job.
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.400]  It did a good job.
[22:35.400 --> 22:37.680]  My best until I had LEDs was when I would put
[22:37.680 --> 22:40.600]  a metal halide and HBS in the same hood
[22:40.600 --> 22:41.520]  and run those together.
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.680]  That was my most flavorful, most potent,
[22:43.680 --> 22:46.880]  most photogenic herb ever until I switched up to the LEDs,
[22:46.880 --> 22:49.680]  and now I think I can far surpass that.
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.000]  And it's much cooler.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.880]  I don't have to fight so much cooling.
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.800]  So that helps out the environment a lot.
[22:54.800 --> 22:57.080]  Until the winter came, and then I needed a heater.
[22:57.080 --> 22:59.360]  I almost put up an HBS again just to keep my room cool
[22:59.360 --> 23:01.280]  or warm, because it got so cold
[23:01.280 --> 23:02.400]  that I didn't know what to do.
[23:02.400 --> 23:04.040]  That was the only complaint that I had.
[23:04.040 --> 23:05.760]  It's like, they're not hot enough.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.520]  Yeah.
[23:08.600 --> 23:11.760]  Okay, so that kind of leads into one of your questions
[23:11.760 --> 23:12.600]  if you wanted to ask it.
[23:12.600 --> 23:13.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:13.440 --> 23:14.880]  Yeah, I was gonna say, people always say
[23:14.880 --> 23:19.400]  that LED is cooler, and it is cooler in some way.
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.440]  I'm noticing that, but I've got more wattage in the room.
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.440]  Technically, there are more watts in there
[23:24.440 --> 23:26.280]  than there was when I was running an HBS.
[23:26.280 --> 23:29.480]  The numbers are higher in wattage, but the heat is lower.
[23:29.480 --> 23:31.600]  I was taught that a watt is a lot
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.240]  because electricity is electricity.
[23:33.240 --> 23:35.520]  Why am I getting less heat out of that light?
[23:38.120 --> 23:39.760]  So it's more efficient.
[23:41.080 --> 23:45.960]  So a watt, and this is, dude, wow.
[23:45.960 --> 23:47.280]  This is something that I've had
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.600]  to beat up nerd fights on all kinds of social media about.
[23:53.040 --> 23:54.560]  I'm not qualified to argue with you,
[23:54.560 --> 23:56.240]  so you're gonna win this nerd fight.
[23:56.240 --> 23:57.080]  A watt is a lot.
[23:57.080 --> 23:58.400]  A watt is a lot.
[23:58.400 --> 24:00.280]  And I'm like, no, it's fucking not.
[24:00.280 --> 24:05.280]  So a watt becomes 3.8 BTU's of heat?
[24:06.080 --> 24:07.920]  Somewhere around there, yeah.
[24:07.920 --> 24:10.320]  But that's only if it becomes heat.
[24:11.360 --> 24:16.200]  If it becomes light and then hits a leaf,
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.480]  then instead of that energy
[24:18.480 --> 24:21.400]  and that watt of electricity becoming heat,
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.320]  it becomes chemical energy locked up in the plant.
[24:26.400 --> 24:27.240]  Chloroplast.
[24:28.320 --> 24:31.080]  Right, yeah, that's what chlorophyll does
[24:31.080 --> 24:34.400]  is it turns light into sugar, basically,
[24:34.400 --> 24:36.200]  or into chemical bonds.
[24:36.200 --> 24:37.040]  All right.
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.880]  So that energy cannot become chemical energy
[24:41.880 --> 24:44.560]  and heat energy at the same time
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.640]  because of the law of thermodynamics.
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.760]  So if you've got a 10 watt water pump,
[24:57.080 --> 24:59.240]  some of those 10 watts will become heat,
[24:59.240 --> 25:02.680]  but some of it will also become mechanical energy,
[25:02.680 --> 25:04.680]  the energy of that moving water.
[25:07.160 --> 25:10.840]  And whatever percentage of that energy
[25:10.840 --> 25:13.040]  that does what the thing is supposed to do
[25:13.040 --> 25:14.760]  is the efficiency.
[25:14.760 --> 25:17.560]  And whatever's left over is the heat.
[25:17.560 --> 25:19.080]  Unless you're talking about a space heater,
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.440]  then it's just 100% heat
[25:20.440 --> 25:22.320]  because that's what it's supposed to do.
[25:22.320 --> 25:24.360]  Efficiency, okay.
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.920]  So if the energy becomes light,
[25:25.920 --> 25:27.680]  then it's not really becoming heat.
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.120]  And so there's that,
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.920]  and then there's the way the heat
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.160]  that an LED does create gets distributed.
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.520]  Like it all gets sucked up into a heat sink
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.480]  and then kind of slowly radiated
[25:42.480 --> 25:44.080]  from the surface of the metal.
[25:45.760 --> 25:47.240]  So if you've got your lights hanging up
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.560]  by your carbon filter, by your exhaust fan,
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.720]  then you're pumping out that heat much more efficiently
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.080]  than an HBS, which has a bunch of heat
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.520]  blasting straight down from the bulb onto your plants.
[26:02.520 --> 26:03.360]  Yeah.
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.360]  You know, instead of slowly radiating
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.720]  directly into your exhaust fan.
[26:08.680 --> 26:10.200]  Okay. That makes sense.
[26:10.200 --> 26:11.040]  Yeah.
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.320]  Big old bright heat source, just throwing heat out.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.840]  And then you've got that efficient little tiny diode.
[26:14.840 --> 26:15.680]  That makes sense.
[26:15.680 --> 26:16.920]  The heat source is so much smaller
[26:16.920 --> 26:18.440]  that it makes sense anyway.
[26:18.440 --> 26:20.600]  But that was a beautiful explanation
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.520]  because honestly, I think I was believing the nerds
[26:23.520 --> 26:24.560]  that a watt is a watt.
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.200]  But the way you said that,
[26:26.200 --> 26:29.800]  even my non-physics understanding self
[26:29.800 --> 26:30.840]  got a good grasp of that.
[26:30.840 --> 26:31.760]  So that was perfect.
[26:31.760 --> 26:32.600]  Thank you, man.
[26:32.600 --> 26:33.440]  It didn't become heat.
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.560]  It became plant energy
[26:34.560 --> 26:36.840]  because it was the right type of light
[26:36.880 --> 26:38.120]  that the plant can use it
[26:38.120 --> 26:40.280]  and it didn't get wasted off this heat.
[26:40.280 --> 26:41.400]  Right.
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.240]  Cool.
[26:42.240 --> 26:43.080]  That makes sense to me.
[26:43.080 --> 26:43.920]  I got a question for you, man.
[26:43.920 --> 26:46.560]  Do you notice that difference in a commercial grow?
[26:46.560 --> 26:48.240]  Like from when the plants are small
[26:48.240 --> 26:50.400]  to when the entire room is just completely covered
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.720]  in canopy, theoretically, the room should get cooler.
[26:53.720 --> 26:54.680]  Does that happen?
[26:55.760 --> 26:57.080]  Yeah. I think so.
[26:57.080 --> 26:58.760]  Yeah. I noticed the humidity more.
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.240]  It's more funky and damp in there because all the plants,
[27:01.240 --> 27:02.840]  but yeah, I do notice it takes more
[27:02.840 --> 27:03.880]  to change the temperature
[27:03.880 --> 27:06.400]  when there are a lot of plants in there, for sure.
[27:07.000 --> 27:07.840]  Yeah.
[27:07.840 --> 27:08.680]  Cool.
[27:08.680 --> 27:09.520]  I'm not exactly sure.
[27:10.360 --> 27:11.200]  Yeah, I think it does.
[27:11.200 --> 27:12.040]  It stays cooler in there
[27:12.040 --> 27:13.680]  because the plants are putting out so much water
[27:13.680 --> 27:16.480]  that it's cool in there, but then it gets so humid.
[27:16.480 --> 27:18.240]  I kind of want to put a big room,
[27:18.240 --> 27:20.160]  a commercial room filled with LEDs.
[27:20.160 --> 27:21.080]  I haven't done that yet.
[27:21.080 --> 27:22.920]  I've just got small spaces,
[27:22.920 --> 27:23.840]  but that's gonna,
[27:23.840 --> 27:26.800]  I'm going to have to rethink everything once I do that.
[27:26.800 --> 27:29.040]  All of the HVAC, all of the airflow,
[27:29.040 --> 27:31.320]  it'll all be a totally different redesign,
[27:31.320 --> 27:33.480]  which is going to throw me for a loop and I can't wait.
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.280]  I love those loops.
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.120]  Yeah, man.
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.200]  So what can other,
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.160]  I know what I can expect because I've done it.
[27:41.160 --> 27:42.520]  Now that I understand the heat part,
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.440]  other than I switched to LEDs in the middle of the winter,
[27:46.440 --> 27:47.680]  and that was a mistake.
[27:47.680 --> 27:48.920]  I should not have done that.
[27:48.920 --> 27:50.640]  So that's something I can warn people about.
[27:50.640 --> 27:52.880]  If you're relying on the light for heat,
[27:52.880 --> 27:54.120]  don't switch in the middle of winter
[27:54.120 --> 27:55.720]  because you will mess your grow up.
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.520]  What else can people expect to expect
[27:58.520 --> 28:01.880]  when they switch from an HVS or a CMH to the LEDs?
[28:01.880 --> 28:03.400]  Because there is a little bit of a learning curve.
[28:03.400 --> 28:04.960]  Can you warn us about anything?
[28:05.920 --> 28:07.160]  Yeah.
[28:07.160 --> 28:09.640]  So there's going to be potentially
[28:09.640 --> 28:11.880]  some changes in your feeding.
[28:11.880 --> 28:13.000]  They might, you know,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.640]  a lot of people say they need more calcium and veg
[28:15.640 --> 28:17.800]  and a little bit more magnesium and flour.
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.360]  So yeah, if you've got a really dialed in feeding regimen
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.480]  with a really well-known strain,
[28:27.320 --> 28:30.160]  the run where you switch your lights up,
[28:30.160 --> 28:32.160]  like you can't just be on autopilot
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.880]  like you were on the last 20 runs.
[28:34.160 --> 28:36.320]  Like you are going to have to watch that plant again
[28:36.320 --> 28:38.840]  because it's going to be feeding differently.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.360]  Yeah.
[28:40.360 --> 28:42.160]  And the temperature is going to be different.
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.800]  So you're going to want to get one of these,
[28:48.080 --> 28:49.400]  an infrared thermometer,
[28:49.400 --> 28:51.280]  and you're going to want to be able to check
[28:51.280 --> 28:53.480]  the surface temperature of your leaf.
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.920]  Because if you're used to growing with CMH or HVS,
[28:58.920 --> 29:00.560]  there's a lot more infrared
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.960]  and a lot more downward facing heat.
[29:02.960 --> 29:06.840]  So the actual temperature of your leaf is usually,
[29:06.840 --> 29:08.040]  if I'm not mistaken,
[29:08.040 --> 29:10.960]  usually higher than the ambient temperature of the room.
[29:12.720 --> 29:15.760]  But with LEDs, you know,
[29:15.760 --> 29:18.400]  and I can pull this screen up again real quick.
[29:21.040 --> 29:23.200]  So over here to the right side
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.400]  of the red portion of this graph
[29:25.400 --> 29:27.720]  is where you get into infrared.
[29:27.720 --> 29:29.160]  And you can see on the graph
[29:29.160 --> 29:31.480]  that the LEDs drop off really sharply
[29:31.520 --> 29:34.360]  and they don't put out any heat.
[29:34.360 --> 29:35.200]  There you go.
[29:35.200 --> 29:36.040]  There you go.
[29:36.040 --> 29:36.880]  Now you're popping up.
[29:36.880 --> 29:38.000]  Yeah, you can see over here on the right,
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.040]  that right where this curve drops off
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.440]  is where you go from far red into infrared, which is heat.
[29:45.320 --> 29:48.560]  And you can see how the LEDs really drop off right there
[29:48.560 --> 29:51.280]  and they don't put out any infrared.
[29:51.280 --> 29:55.160]  So what's going to happen is your leaf surface temperature
[29:55.160 --> 29:58.200]  is going to be almost exactly the same
[29:58.200 --> 30:00.280]  as the ambient temperature of your room.
[30:00.280 --> 30:01.120]  Cool.
[30:01.760 --> 30:02.600]  So some people will be like,
[30:02.600 --> 30:05.240]  oh, put infrared on your control lights.
[30:05.240 --> 30:08.240]  And I'm like, okay, let's think this through real quick.
[30:08.240 --> 30:12.440]  You want to spend extra money on an LED light
[30:12.440 --> 30:14.960]  that's going to reduce your temperatures.
[30:14.960 --> 30:18.160]  And then you want to spend extra more money
[30:18.160 --> 30:20.120]  on an infrared light
[30:20.120 --> 30:23.080]  that's going to raise your temperatures back up again.
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.600]  But all you have to do is turn down your AC a few degrees
[30:28.600 --> 30:32.680]  and raise the temperature of your ambient temperature
[30:32.680 --> 30:33.880]  of your garden.
[30:33.880 --> 30:35.960]  And then that will raise the leaf surface temperature
[30:35.960 --> 30:37.480]  up to where you want it.
[30:37.480 --> 30:39.680]  And you're spending less money on AC,
[30:39.680 --> 30:41.600]  which is the whole fucking point
[30:41.600 --> 30:43.640]  of getting an efficient light.
[30:43.640 --> 30:47.560]  Instead of spending more money on making your light hotter.
[30:47.560 --> 30:50.000]  So you can run your AC harder and get the same.
[30:50.000 --> 30:50.840]  Right.
[30:50.840 --> 30:51.680]  It's like.
[30:51.680 --> 30:54.520]  Yeah, my electric bill has gone down quite a bit.
[30:54.520 --> 30:56.560]  Quite a bit since I switched LEDs.
[30:56.560 --> 30:58.320]  I'm not running the big HPSs.
[30:59.040 --> 30:59.880]  So they're not sucking up so much juice,
[30:59.880 --> 31:02.560]  but then I don't have so many fans and ACs going.
[31:02.560 --> 31:04.000]  I don't have to fight the room so much.
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.240]  So yeah, it definitely made a big difference.
[31:06.240 --> 31:07.280]  Big difference.
[31:07.280 --> 31:09.920]  I'm so glad I converted you, man.
[31:09.920 --> 31:12.000]  Yeah, I was hesitant.
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.880]  I was skeptical for a long time,
[31:13.880 --> 31:15.560]  but I always called it a light bright
[31:15.560 --> 31:17.120]  because I saw those silly purple things.
[31:17.120 --> 31:18.200]  And I was like, that's not,
[31:18.200 --> 31:20.960]  and I saw so many weird mixed results from plants.
[31:20.960 --> 31:21.960]  I called it a light bright.
[31:21.960 --> 31:23.320]  But then when I saw what yours were doing
[31:23.320 --> 31:26.200]  and then we worked out a nice thing,
[31:26.200 --> 31:27.040]  it was definitely worth it.
[31:27.040 --> 31:27.880]  And I'm glad I did it.
[31:28.440 --> 31:29.280]  Good job, man.
[31:29.280 --> 31:30.120]  Thank you.
[31:30.120 --> 31:30.960]  Good sales pitch.
[31:30.960 --> 31:32.000]  And you stayed on me for a minute.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.360]  I'm looking to see if I have any more notes.
[31:33.360 --> 31:35.880]  I think we've answered most of my questions.
[31:35.880 --> 31:37.720]  The changes I noticed we're gonna change
[31:37.720 --> 31:40.760]  are feeding and plant structure and growth.
[31:40.760 --> 31:43.160]  We're not gonna get as much stretch as I'm used to.
[31:43.160 --> 31:44.560]  Little bit tighter nodes.
[31:45.720 --> 31:46.960]  I may have needed a heater.
[31:46.960 --> 31:49.120]  It may have been wise to put in a heater during the winter,
[31:49.120 --> 31:51.440]  but other than that, I think I nailed it.
[31:51.440 --> 31:54.440]  Do you offer any products with a far red light
[31:54.440 --> 31:56.560]  or is that something coming in the future?
[31:58.760 --> 32:00.360]  Yeah, not really, man.
[32:00.360 --> 32:02.720]  I mean, I've done it all.
[32:02.720 --> 32:05.520]  Like I've tried far reds, I guess.
[32:05.520 --> 32:07.880]  Probably a Gromouse puck would be your best bet
[32:07.880 --> 32:10.240]  if you wanna fuck around with far red.
[32:10.240 --> 32:14.880]  But what we're all about at Black Sale Market
[32:14.880 --> 32:19.880]  is building really big, high quality,
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.760]  high intensity, full spectrum LEDs.
[32:24.760 --> 32:27.360]  Because all of my experience and everything I've learned
[32:27.840 --> 32:30.760]  has shown me that that's what gets the job done.
[32:30.760 --> 32:32.160]  You need the proper intensity.
[32:32.160 --> 32:34.360]  You need a big fuck off powerful light.
[32:36.200 --> 32:39.000]  And you want it as efficient as possible
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.800]  and as cheap as possible.
[32:41.880 --> 32:46.880]  So that's always been like my ethic
[32:47.240 --> 32:51.720]  and what's guided me in the design of all my lights
[32:51.720 --> 32:53.840]  is that goal.
[32:53.840 --> 32:57.960]  And that's how you get the job done, man.
[32:57.960 --> 32:59.800]  I think there's a lot of really overpriced
[32:59.800 --> 33:02.240]  and over-engineered lights out there.
[33:02.240 --> 33:07.240]  And all you really need to know is 3,500K, 3,000K
[33:07.840 --> 33:10.000]  and hit the proper intensity.
[33:11.480 --> 33:16.480]  So like for instance, like my 640 watt two pack,
[33:17.560 --> 33:19.840]  it will give you maximum growth rates and yields
[33:19.880 --> 33:24.880]  in flower over a four by four, in veg over a five by five.
[33:24.880 --> 33:29.720]  And it's on sale for $665 with coupon code Rasta Jack.
[33:29.720 --> 33:34.040]  So if you know your LEDs, you know that's an amazing deal.
[33:34.040 --> 33:37.360]  And that like, we're not fucking around over here.
[33:39.880 --> 33:40.880]  I loved it.
[33:40.880 --> 33:42.760]  I wasn't gonna bring it up cause it wasn't important
[33:42.760 --> 33:45.920]  but I could feel your army training come through.
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.880]  Like get the fucking job done.
[33:47.880 --> 33:49.040]  We don't need extra shit.
[33:49.080 --> 33:50.120]  We don't need frills.
[33:50.120 --> 33:50.960]  We don't need bells.
[33:50.960 --> 33:51.960]  We don't need whistles.
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.880]  We don't need fucking fancy glitter tape.
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.360]  Get the job done.
[33:55.360 --> 33:56.520]  I love that approach.
[33:56.520 --> 33:57.880]  And I'm gonna compliment you.
[33:57.880 --> 33:59.320]  I've been to your workspace.
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.080]  I've been to your old workspace and your new workspace.
[34:02.080 --> 34:04.880]  You guys, his workspace is immaculate.
[34:04.880 --> 34:09.080]  You can sit down and eat dinner off of his workspace floor.
[34:09.080 --> 34:10.320]  I complimented him one time.
[34:10.320 --> 34:12.280]  I said, dude, you cleaned the fucking corner
[34:12.280 --> 34:13.520]  that I would have missed.
[34:14.440 --> 34:16.360]  He gets in there and there's that corner.
[34:16.360 --> 34:18.640]  That's right here that everybody like you swept everything
[34:18.640 --> 34:20.800]  but right there, there's a little schmeck in the corner.
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.040]  He gets that stuff.
[34:22.040 --> 34:24.800]  So that tells me the way that somebody does something
[34:24.800 --> 34:26.080]  is the way they do everything.
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.040]  So that tells me those lights are put together
[34:28.040 --> 34:30.120]  but the corners have been cleaned and dusted.
[34:30.120 --> 34:31.840]  So that's a good compliment to you, bro.
[34:31.840 --> 34:34.800]  Thank you for taking such good care of your customers.
[34:34.800 --> 34:36.080]  Thank you, man.
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.760]  And you didn't know I was coming to inspect.
[34:37.760 --> 34:38.960]  So it was super clean.
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.120]  I showed up randomly.
[34:41.320 --> 34:43.320]  Surprise inspection.
[34:43.320 --> 34:44.160]  Yep.
[34:44.160 --> 34:45.120]  I got you.
[34:45.120 --> 34:47.800]  No, it's, I mean, and that's honestly
[34:48.320 --> 34:52.920]  that very rugged kind of utilitarian sort of,
[34:53.840 --> 34:56.000]  like if the army was gonna build a grow light,
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.240]  it would probably look a lot like mine.
[34:58.240 --> 35:00.400]  Like, you know.
[35:00.400 --> 35:01.680]  It gets the job done, man.
[35:01.680 --> 35:04.560]  It's a fucking tank and it will get the job done.
[35:04.560 --> 35:07.080]  It might be all green or something instead of black,
[35:07.080 --> 35:09.200]  but yeah.
[35:09.200 --> 35:10.480]  Now you just sold them an idea.
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.320]  They're gonna come out with it.
[35:11.320 --> 35:12.840]  Let me give you guys a picture.
[35:12.840 --> 35:15.480]  I've actually got a lot of iRegenetics growing
[35:15.520 --> 35:18.720]  under my Canon LEDs.
[35:18.720 --> 35:19.560]  Excellent.
[35:19.560 --> 35:22.560]  I like it when you show off those pictures.
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.640]  I mean, it's one thing to hear us talk about it,
[35:24.640 --> 35:28.240]  but it's another thing to see it for yourself, you know?
[35:28.240 --> 35:33.240]  And so that's three of my 320 watt Canons over a four by six.
[35:34.040 --> 35:36.400]  And that's four orange gasms in there
[35:36.400 --> 35:38.520]  filling out a four by six.
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.680]  That looks really, really good.
[35:40.680 --> 35:42.920]  Do you have those LEDs at full power
[35:42.920 --> 35:44.640]  or are they turned down at all?
[35:44.640 --> 35:46.240]  No, they're at full power.
[35:46.240 --> 35:47.080]  Okay.
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.320]  So each one's covering a two by four basically.
[35:50.320 --> 35:51.720]  All right.
[35:51.720 --> 35:52.800]  What is that?
[35:52.800 --> 35:57.640]  In flower, everything, all my coverage areas
[35:57.640 --> 35:59.360]  and recommendations on that front
[35:59.360 --> 36:03.360]  are designed for maximum yields in flower.
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.080]  So in veg, because your day is 30% longer,
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.160]  you have to remember to turn that light down 30%.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.080]  And they're all dimmable, you know,
[36:14.520 --> 36:17.120]  which is another really great thing about LEDs, man.
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.520]  Because if you're running the same amount of wattage
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.520]  in veg and flower, you're fucking up, you know?
[36:23.520 --> 36:24.360]  Right.
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.680]  The plant's got a certain amount of light
[36:28.680 --> 36:31.280]  that it can process in a day.
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.000]  And in veg, that day is 33% longer.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  So the intensity needs to be turned down 33%, you know?
[36:40.640 --> 36:42.680]  If you start seeing the leaves start drooping,
[36:42.680 --> 36:44.040]  you can't see my arms at the edge of the screen.
[36:44.880 --> 36:46.480]  If you start drooping and getting just a little bit weak
[36:46.480 --> 36:48.480]  toward the end of the day, they're not dry,
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.040]  they're not angry, they're tired.
[36:50.040 --> 36:52.160]  They've had enough light, they wanna go to sleep.
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.720]  You can either reduce your amount of light
[36:54.720 --> 36:56.080]  that is coming out of that light.
[36:56.080 --> 36:57.480]  Or if you're on the right schedule,
[36:57.480 --> 36:59.800]  you can reduce an hour of daylight.
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.280]  Don't over light the plants.
[37:01.280 --> 37:03.000]  You can save electricity.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.760]  It doesn't matter a lot when you're running two cannons.
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.320]  Your electricity bill is not gonna notice.
[37:07.320 --> 37:09.960]  But when you're running a hundred Gabitas,
[37:09.960 --> 37:11.400]  that kind of stuff really adds up.
[37:11.400 --> 37:12.600]  So learn everything you can
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.880]  just to make yourself a little bit more efficient.
[37:14.880 --> 37:16.840]  And right now, during these times, bro,
[37:16.840 --> 37:17.800]  paychecks are hard to get.
[37:17.800 --> 37:19.160]  Money is more expensive than ever.
[37:19.160 --> 37:21.000]  So even if you are running two cannons,
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.280]  maybe that will save you a difference.
[37:22.280 --> 37:24.320]  Maybe that six bucks on the electric bill
[37:24.320 --> 37:25.600]  might get you somewhere these days.
[37:25.600 --> 37:27.600]  That's a fucking gallon of gas right now.
[37:30.680 --> 37:32.560]  Yeah, money's expensive nowadays.
[37:32.560 --> 37:33.440]  Things are weird.
[37:34.440 --> 37:37.640]  Are cannon lights readily available?
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.280]  Oh yeah, definitely, man.
[37:40.280 --> 37:41.120]  Excellent.
[37:41.120 --> 37:41.960]  I know you make them yourself
[37:42.320 --> 37:44.000]  and I know that supply chains are weird right now.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.720]  I was at the grocery store trying to buy soil and nutrients
[37:46.720 --> 37:48.120]  and just basic things.
[37:48.120 --> 37:49.880]  And half the stuff I wanted was sold out.
[37:49.880 --> 37:51.480]  So knowing that your lights are there,
[37:51.480 --> 37:53.280]  that makes me feel better.
[37:53.280 --> 37:55.560]  Yeah, I have managed to,
[37:55.560 --> 37:58.000]  I mean, there's been some definite adjustments
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  I've had to make.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.200]  And I had to start ordering my inventory
[38:04.240 --> 38:06.240]  a lot farther ahead.
[38:06.240 --> 38:07.080]  Oh yeah.
[38:08.160 --> 38:10.640]  But so far, man, I haven't sold out.
[38:10.640 --> 38:11.680]  I've come close, dude.
[38:12.400 --> 38:13.480]  I've been down to like my last two lights
[38:13.480 --> 38:14.880]  and like, oh shit.
[38:14.880 --> 38:15.840]  That's excellent.
[38:15.840 --> 38:18.840]  Yeah, what are these boxes gonna get here?
[38:18.840 --> 38:21.520]  But so far I haven't run out.
[38:21.520 --> 38:22.360]  Good.
[38:22.360 --> 38:23.200]  Well, it's a sign of good business
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.920]  being worried that you're going to run out.
[38:24.920 --> 38:27.600]  That's a sign of success coming your way.
[38:27.600 --> 38:28.800]  That's a good job, bro.
[38:28.800 --> 38:31.440]  All right, I think we've got a lot of great info out of you.
[38:31.440 --> 38:32.880]  Do you have anything you wanna share with us
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.480]  before we start wrapping up this part of the show?
[38:35.480 --> 38:36.840]  Oh, just real quick, dude.
[38:36.840 --> 38:39.360]  The third thing you need to know about LEDs
[38:39.400 --> 38:42.920]  is that to get the proper intensity in veg,
[38:42.920 --> 38:45.920]  you need about 600 watts per four by four
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.080]  of high quality full spectrum LEDs.
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.040]  So forget about everything I just showed you
[38:52.040 --> 38:55.960]  with graphs and numbers, all that shit, forget about it.
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.960]  Just learn three things, 3000 Kelvin, 3500 Kelvin,
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.560]  600 watts per four by four.
[39:04.560 --> 39:06.360]  And you should be able to do the math on that.
[39:06.800 --> 39:09.520]  That's 900 watts for a five by five,
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.720]  300 watts for a two by four.
[39:11.720 --> 39:13.200]  Somewhere in that neighborhood,
[39:13.200 --> 39:16.720]  and you're gonna be at the proper intensity for flower,
[39:16.720 --> 39:19.720]  and then just turn your light down 30% in veg.
[39:19.720 --> 39:22.080]  And that's everything you need to know about LEDs, man.
[39:22.080 --> 39:25.080]  As a grower, you will be set up for success, dude.
[39:25.080 --> 39:27.240]  You will get the fucking job done.
[39:27.240 --> 39:28.800]  There you go.
[39:28.800 --> 39:30.720]  I'm breeding under LEDs, I'm loving them.
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.720]  Sounds like a great formula for success.
[39:34.520 --> 39:35.680]  I think we covered everything.
[39:35.720 --> 39:36.960]  I'm gonna remind them one more time
[39:36.960 --> 39:39.600]  to check out blacksailmarket.com
[39:39.600 --> 39:40.960]  and use coupon code Ross to Jeff.
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.680]  Make sure you go get yourself some Canon LEDs.
[39:43.680 --> 39:46.560]  Is there plenty of contact info on the website?
[39:46.560 --> 39:47.440]  So if they have questions,
[39:47.440 --> 39:49.400]  they can harass you and stalk you.
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.600]  Yeah, man, you'll find my email on the website.
[39:51.600 --> 39:54.160]  And again, hit me up on Instagram
[39:54.160 --> 39:56.320]  or canonbuzz at blacksailmarket.
[39:57.280 --> 39:58.240]  Yeah, give him a follow, you guys.
[39:58.240 --> 39:59.320]  He posts a lot of great stuff,
[39:59.320 --> 40:00.560]  posts a lot of iRegenetics,
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.480]  cause he's growing my stuff.
[40:01.480 --> 40:02.320]  So give him a follow there.
[40:02.320 --> 40:04.120]  And thank you, bro, for the great photos.
[40:04.160 --> 40:06.800]  Oh yeah, man, thank you for the great weed.
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.840]  Oh man, it works out very well.
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.840]  I think that's all we've got, dude.
[40:10.840 --> 40:12.400]  Thank you for giving me a great presentation.
[40:12.400 --> 40:13.880]  Thank you for teaching me about lights
[40:13.880 --> 40:15.120]  in a way that I could understand.
[40:15.120 --> 40:16.360]  I feel like if I understood it,
[40:16.360 --> 40:18.160]  then my audience probably did too.
[40:18.160 --> 40:19.200]  So they're all saying thank you.
[40:19.200 --> 40:21.440]  You're getting about 5,000 high fives right now.
[40:21.440 --> 40:22.360]  So thank you, bro.
[40:22.360 --> 40:23.640]  You guys make sure you check out my buddy,
