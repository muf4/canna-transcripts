[00:16.760 --> 00:19.320]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.320 --> 00:21.080]  It's time for episode number 203
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.900]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.900 --> 00:26.800]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.800 --> 00:27.880]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.880 --> 00:28.940]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.940 --> 00:31.300]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.300 --> 00:32.640]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:32.640 --> 00:34.080]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.840]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.840 --> 00:38.840]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.840 --> 00:40.760]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.680]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.680 --> 00:44.880]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.880 --> 00:46.520]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.280 --> 00:49.000]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.360 --> 00:56.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, took a little bit of a nap
[00:56.880 --> 00:59.680]  and I woke up and I felt like I time traveled or some shit.
[00:59.680 --> 01:01.760]  I don't know, I felt like I was asleep for 17 days.
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.600]  Felt really strange.
[01:02.600 --> 01:03.640]  You ever take a nap and you wake up
[01:03.640 --> 01:05.000]  and it feels like it's been fucking forever
[01:05.000 --> 01:05.840]  and you don't know what happened,
[01:05.840 --> 01:07.560]  you don't know where you are?
[01:07.560 --> 01:09.000]  Like, why the fuck am I on this couch
[01:09.000 --> 01:10.720]  in a living room with the TV on?
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.880]  Never knew I did that.
[01:11.880 --> 01:13.440]  Felt strange, anyway.
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.240]  I woke up on the couch watching Ridiculousness.
[01:15.280 --> 01:17.120]  I do not remember falling asleep to that shit.
[01:17.120 --> 01:18.360]  I must've took some fat dabs.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.520]  It must've been a good day.
[01:19.520 --> 01:22.120]  It's a fucking snow day here in Colorado, you guys.
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.640]  This is April 29th.
[01:23.640 --> 01:25.040]  We got a surprise snowstorm.
[01:25.040 --> 01:27.560]  So I feel bad for anybody who put their cannabis plants
[01:27.560 --> 01:29.400]  or any type of plants outside too early
[01:29.400 --> 01:31.800]  because they got beat to shit last night.
[01:31.800 --> 01:33.000]  We got about a foot of snow,
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.920]  maybe 16 or 18 inches worth of heavy, thick,
[01:35.920 --> 01:37.600]  cold, chunky fucking snow.
[01:37.600 --> 01:38.760]  And it sure does suck.
[01:38.760 --> 01:40.600]  It's been cold and windy.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.000]  The power does keep cutting out,
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.800]  so I apologize if my recording cuts out here.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.960]  I'm using the MacBook and I've got some backup plans here,
[01:46.960 --> 01:48.360]  so we'll get it going.
[01:48.360 --> 01:50.600]  But I apologize if the power cuts out,
[01:50.600 --> 01:51.480]  if the video cuts out.
[01:51.480 --> 01:52.720]  There's nothing I can do about that.
[01:52.720 --> 01:55.640]  I'll keep the MacBook going and I will keep recording.
[01:55.640 --> 01:57.720]  We'll make this happen.
[01:57.720 --> 01:58.840]  Hopefully I get some wifi.
[01:58.840 --> 02:01.720]  Hopefully I don't have to drive to Starbucks or somewhere.
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.000]  I may have to go to work and make this upload here.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.480]  If I don't get any wifi soon,
[02:06.480 --> 02:07.520]  it's maybe what I'm doing.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.120]  Maybe going to Starbucks or driving to the office
[02:09.120 --> 02:10.240]  to post this episode.
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.400]  Just now thought of that.
[02:11.400 --> 02:12.920]  All right, hopefully everything cooperates with me.
[02:12.920 --> 02:13.760]  It's been cold and shitty.
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.680]  Hopefully I can get some technology on my side.
[02:16.680 --> 02:18.320]  Speaking of technology on my side,
[02:18.320 --> 02:20.760]  holy shit, here's a weird thing that I experienced.
[02:20.760 --> 02:23.680]  I have got a G-Nail from our friends at Emotech.
[02:23.680 --> 02:25.480]  I'm sure you guys hear me talk about my E-Nail all the time.
[02:25.480 --> 02:28.800]  I've got the G-Nail made by Giddy Up from Emotech.
[02:28.800 --> 02:31.160]  When the power goes out,
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.680]  even if my E-Nail is turned off,
[02:32.680 --> 02:34.240]  right now my E-Nail is off.
[02:34.240 --> 02:36.000]  The power button, the little button you press,
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.520]  that red button, it is turned off.
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.520]  It's just a press button.
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.880]  It does have a toggle switch on the back.
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.800]  But if you have that toggle switch on,
[02:43.800 --> 02:45.200]  you're able to just grab that red button
[02:45.200 --> 02:46.360]  and turn on your G-Nail,
[02:46.360 --> 02:48.560]  and you can take dabs within like two minutes.
[02:48.560 --> 02:50.840]  When the power goes off and comes back on,
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.040]  when the power comes back on,
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.360]  it turns on the fucking E-Nail.
[02:54.360 --> 02:56.520]  Really scary, because if you just happen to leave that
[02:56.520 --> 02:58.560]  sitting on the table or something like that,
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.560]  and it comes on, it will catch on fire,
[03:00.560 --> 03:02.520]  and it will burn your fucking house down.
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.520]  Luckily, I discovered that a few weeks ago.
[03:05.520 --> 03:08.840]  I was cleaning up, and I set the E-Nail coil on the table,
[03:08.840 --> 03:10.600]  and I unplugged it, and I cleaned up the table,
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.440]  and I cleaned up around it, and then I plugged it back in.
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.080]  And a few minutes later, I smelled something funky.
[03:14.080 --> 03:14.960]  I was like, yo, what's that smell?
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.360]  It smells like something's burning.
[03:16.360 --> 03:17.360]  And I walked around the kitchen.
[03:17.360 --> 03:18.320]  I walked around the dining room.
[03:18.320 --> 03:19.240]  I walked all over the place.
[03:19.240 --> 03:20.400]  Then I came back to the dab table,
[03:20.400 --> 03:21.240]  and I was like, it's right here.
[03:21.240 --> 03:22.080]  I can smell it.
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.760]  But there was nothing, nothing made sense
[03:23.760 --> 03:24.600]  to where it would stink.
[03:24.600 --> 03:26.120]  And then finally, I was just looking around the table,
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.320]  and I could see the E-Nail glowing red.
[03:29.320 --> 03:31.160]  It was on an oil slick pad,
[03:31.160 --> 03:33.200]  which was the only thing keeping my table from burning.
[03:33.200 --> 03:35.520]  So big shout out to my friends at Oil Slick.
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.320]  You kind of prevented a little bit of a fire,
[03:37.320 --> 03:39.360]  and your product held up to some shit.
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.200]  My table is black underneath there.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.200]  There's a perfectly round scorch mark
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.320]  where the E-Nail started to burn the fuck out of the table,
[03:47.320 --> 03:48.840]  but this oil slick pad held up.
[03:48.840 --> 03:49.680]  It did not burn.
[03:49.680 --> 03:50.520]  It didn't melt.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.360]  It didn't ignite.
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.000]  So I think it may have saved some shit.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.720]  So shout out to our friends at Oil Slick.
[03:54.720 --> 03:56.460]  Also, I think that's fucking crazy
[03:56.460 --> 03:57.920]  that my G-Nail comes on
[03:57.920 --> 03:59.480]  when the power comes back on like that.
[03:59.480 --> 04:01.200]  So if you've got an E-Nail,
[04:01.200 --> 04:03.040]  whatever brand you've got, be careful.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.040]  Pay attention to that shit.
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.120]  If the power goes out, don't set it down somewhere retarded.
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.400]  Don't leave it somewhere weird.
[04:08.440 --> 04:09.440]  Be really careful, please.
[04:09.440 --> 04:11.160]  I don't want you to burn your shit down.
[04:11.160 --> 04:13.040]  All right, I think that nap made me a little bit goofy,
[04:13.040 --> 04:13.880]  you guys.
[04:13.880 --> 04:15.120]  I feel like I'm still a little bit groggy in my head,
[04:15.120 --> 04:15.960]  so I apologize.
[04:15.960 --> 04:16.780]  I'm catching up.
[04:16.780 --> 04:17.620]  I'm waking up.
[04:17.620 --> 04:18.680]  I'm getting my shit together.
[04:18.680 --> 04:19.560]  I'm looking at my show notes,
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.400]  and they just look like a bunch of little kid scribbles,
[04:21.400 --> 04:24.520]  so I'm trying to figure out where the heck I am.
[04:24.520 --> 04:25.360]  Let's talk about this.
[04:25.360 --> 04:28.440]  On Stitcher, thanks for everybody that listens on Stitcher.
[04:28.440 --> 04:31.640]  On Stitcher Radio, the podcast this week, April 29th,
[04:31.640 --> 04:36.640]  the podcast was ranked number 687 out of 40,000 shows.
[04:36.840 --> 04:38.900]  There are 40,000 shows on Stitcher Radio.
[04:38.900 --> 04:41.320]  We are ranked number 687.
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.520]  That's super awesome.
[04:42.520 --> 04:43.480]  That's impressive to me.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.680]  I appreciate you guys for listening.
[04:44.680 --> 04:45.800]  Thanks for all the support.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.060]  Makes me feel good inside.
[04:47.060 --> 04:50.960]  Also, in the lifestyle, the health and lifestyle category,
[04:50.960 --> 04:54.400]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast was ranked number 50.
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.400]  That's right, in a category, we're ranked number 50.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.540]  We're plus 57.
[04:57.540 --> 05:00.280]  We moved 57 places up from last week.
[05:00.280 --> 05:02.740]  We've been in that lifestyle, that health and lifestyle
[05:02.740 --> 05:04.680]  top 100 for a few weeks now.
[05:04.680 --> 05:06.180]  Thank you guys for keeping me there.
[05:06.700 --> 05:08.020]  I appreciate that.
[05:08.020 --> 05:09.060]  I've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[05:09.060 --> 05:10.300]  You guys, we've got an email I wanna read.
[05:10.300 --> 05:11.580]  I wanna talk about some musical stuff
[05:11.580 --> 05:13.580]  that people have been talking about.
[05:13.580 --> 05:15.620]  But since the power keeps going out around here,
[05:15.620 --> 05:17.940]  people have been asking me questions about the power
[05:17.940 --> 05:19.340]  and about interrupting cycles.
[05:19.340 --> 05:22.340]  So let's talk about that for a couple of seconds.
[05:22.340 --> 05:26.140]  Everybody knows that cannabis is based on photo period.
[05:26.140 --> 05:28.980]  What makes cannabis go to its flowering phase
[05:28.980 --> 05:30.600]  is called its photo period.
[05:30.600 --> 05:33.620]  When you reduce the lights to approximately 12 hours on
[05:33.620 --> 05:35.940]  and 12 hours off, that will signal your plants
[05:36.700 --> 05:38.780]  to flower because they think it is the flowering season.
[05:38.780 --> 05:40.620]  They think it's coming toward the end of the year.
[05:40.620 --> 05:41.860]  They need to start kicking out buds.
[05:41.860 --> 05:42.940]  They need to get pollinated.
[05:42.940 --> 05:45.060]  They need to make seeds so they can reproduce
[05:45.060 --> 05:47.340]  and do it all over again next year.
[05:47.340 --> 05:51.720]  So photo period is completely crucial to cannabis plants.
[05:52.580 --> 05:54.940]  The power keeps going out and people are freaking out.
[05:54.940 --> 05:58.860]  You guys, it is okay to interrupt your day cycle.
[05:58.860 --> 06:01.940]  The light, if the lights are on, you can fuck that up.
[06:01.940 --> 06:03.340]  You can turn those lights off.
[06:03.340 --> 06:04.660]  You should be turning off the lights
[06:04.660 --> 06:06.180]  when you're spraying most pesticides
[06:06.180 --> 06:08.020]  or most foliar feeds or whatever boosts
[06:08.020 --> 06:08.860]  you're going to spray.
[06:08.860 --> 06:11.200]  The light should go off for that anyway.
[06:11.200 --> 06:15.180]  So it is okay to turn off the lights during a light cycle.
[06:15.180 --> 06:17.060]  It's okay to have a little bit of an interruption.
[06:17.060 --> 06:18.460]  It kind of sucks.
[06:18.460 --> 06:21.900]  Lights are the number one nutrient that your plants require
[06:21.900 --> 06:23.740]  and it's the number one thing that makes them grow
[06:23.740 --> 06:26.340]  and live and function and survive and do their thing.
[06:26.340 --> 06:28.780]  Photosynthesize is what they're trying to do
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.140]  with that light.
[06:30.140 --> 06:31.440]  But when you interrupt it for a little bit,
[06:31.440 --> 06:34.460]  all they do is not get that growth and that vigor
[06:35.140 --> 06:35.980]  and that strength and that power.
[06:35.980 --> 06:36.800]  That's all you're doing.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.640]  You're not interrupting anything.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.460]  You're not messing anything up.
[06:38.460 --> 06:40.020]  Sorry, I'm making sure that I didn't bump a button
[06:40.020 --> 06:40.860]  and stop the recording.
[06:40.860 --> 06:42.300]  It's still going, so we're good.
[06:42.300 --> 06:43.780]  You can interrupt the day cycle.
[06:43.780 --> 06:48.220]  However, you cannot interrupt the night cycle.
[06:48.220 --> 06:50.940]  Interrupting the dark cycle of flowering plants
[06:50.940 --> 06:53.220]  will cause hermaphrodite problems.
[06:53.220 --> 06:55.220]  So let's say you put your plants into flower.
[06:55.220 --> 06:57.900]  They are on from, it's 8.30 on my clock right now.
[06:57.900 --> 06:59.740]  Say they went to sleep at eight o'clock.
[06:59.740 --> 07:01.800]  The dark cycle starts at eight o'clock PM
[07:01.800 --> 07:04.340]  and doesn't come back on until eight o'clock AM.
[07:05.180 --> 07:06.820]  You cannot go in there and turn on a light.
[07:06.820 --> 07:08.140]  You can't use your cell phone.
[07:08.140 --> 07:09.380]  That's too much light.
[07:09.380 --> 07:11.940]  You can't go in there and flip on a little fluorescent light.
[07:11.940 --> 07:12.780]  That's too much light.
[07:12.780 --> 07:14.060]  You can't use a handheld flashlight.
[07:14.060 --> 07:15.260]  That is too much light.
[07:15.260 --> 07:19.340]  Those plants require 100% total darkness for 12 hours
[07:19.340 --> 07:21.620]  or you will cause problems.
[07:21.620 --> 07:23.220]  They're much more sensitive
[07:23.220 --> 07:25.220]  at the start of the flowering phase.
[07:25.220 --> 07:26.460]  And then they're a little more sensitive
[07:26.460 --> 07:28.480]  toward the end of the flowering phase in the middle.
[07:28.480 --> 07:29.540]  They are not as sensitive,
[07:29.540 --> 07:32.460]  but still don't fuck around and interrupt their dark cycle.
[07:32.460 --> 07:33.740]  That will cause hermaphrodites.
[07:33.740 --> 07:35.380]  You'll get seeds.
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.460]  If you go extreme, they will revege.
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.260]  They will turn back around and go into veg.
[07:39.260 --> 07:40.300]  They'll start foxtailing.
[07:40.300 --> 07:41.140]  They'll get real green.
[07:41.140 --> 07:42.540]  They'll start looking like shit.
[07:42.540 --> 07:43.940]  The buds will get fluffy.
[07:43.940 --> 07:45.140]  They won't be tight, compressed,
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.580]  resinous buds like you're looking for.
[07:46.580 --> 07:49.840]  So stop going into grow rooms in the dark.
[07:49.840 --> 07:51.940]  Also, it is okay to interrupt the day cycle.
[07:51.940 --> 07:52.780]  That's what I'm saying.
[07:52.780 --> 07:53.620]  You can't interrupt the night cycle,
[07:53.620 --> 07:56.820]  but you can interrupt the day cycle and you will be okay.
[07:56.820 --> 07:59.260]  If you do insist on going in your grow room at night,
[07:59.260 --> 08:00.780]  here's one thing I recommend.
[08:00.780 --> 08:03.920]  Get yourself some green fluorescent lights.
[08:03.920 --> 08:05.740]  You can get T5 bulbs that are green.
[08:05.740 --> 08:07.260]  You can get T8 bulbs that are green,
[08:07.260 --> 08:11.060]  and they sell those little coily spun fluorescent light bulbs,
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.700]  the compact fluorescent bulbs.
[08:12.700 --> 08:14.780]  Put those in all of your normal light receptacles.
[08:14.780 --> 08:16.220]  So that way you can turn those on
[08:16.220 --> 08:17.640]  and you can work in the dark.
[08:17.640 --> 08:20.020]  Be very careful coming in and out of that room
[08:20.020 --> 08:22.060]  when the dark cycles happen.
[08:22.060 --> 08:23.660]  That's gonna be your own judgment.
[08:23.660 --> 08:25.320]  Maybe a couple of quick seconds won't hurt you,
[08:25.320 --> 08:28.020]  but please just try to get the work done
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.180]  before the lights go off if you can.
[08:30.860 --> 08:33.380]  Another thing, I am super glad.
[08:33.380 --> 08:34.700]  A friend of mine needed some clones
[08:34.700 --> 08:36.260]  and I had a plant that I was gonna get rid of
[08:36.260 --> 08:38.220]  because I'm just not gonna grow it anymore.
[08:38.220 --> 08:39.180]  It takes up too much space
[08:39.180 --> 08:41.240]  and I've got too many things to choose from.
[08:41.240 --> 08:43.460]  A friend of mine asked for some clones,
[08:43.460 --> 08:46.480]  and I am really glad that I was using Rapid Rooters
[08:46.480 --> 08:48.140]  instead of my Easy Cloner this round
[08:48.140 --> 08:50.140]  because the power was out, no shit.
[08:50.140 --> 08:51.660]  The power was out for like seven hours.
[08:51.660 --> 08:52.700]  It went off around midnight.
[08:52.700 --> 08:54.500]  It came back around three for a little bit,
[08:54.500 --> 08:56.300]  but not long enough to matter,
[08:56.300 --> 08:58.100]  just long enough to make you think you're gonna get power,
[08:58.100 --> 09:00.900]  and then it didn't come back until seven in the morning.
[09:00.900 --> 09:02.900]  If I had been running hydroponics
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.860]  or if I had been running Easy Cloners,
[09:04.860 --> 09:07.060]  I think I would have lost several plants,
[09:07.060 --> 09:08.260]  especially in the Easy Cloners.
[09:08.260 --> 09:10.060]  New shit in the Easy Cloner would not have lasted.
[09:10.060 --> 09:11.540]  You guys, I gotta take a quick drink.
[09:11.540 --> 09:12.780]  I'm not gonna press pause, I'm just gonna do it,
[09:12.780 --> 09:13.940]  but that's why you don't hear me for a second.
[09:13.940 --> 09:15.780]  My throat's getting scratchy already.
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.220]  All right, sorry about that.
[09:23.220 --> 09:24.900]  Thanks for letting me take a quick drink.
[09:24.900 --> 09:27.100]  But I feel like if without power for that long
[09:27.100 --> 09:28.260]  and a hydroponic system,
[09:28.260 --> 09:29.420]  I would have really been having problems.
[09:29.420 --> 09:31.140]  So I feel bad for everybody
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.820]  who put their plants out too early
[09:33.420 --> 09:35.060]  and everybody that was running hydro and got fucked up.
[09:35.060 --> 09:35.940]  That sucks.
[09:37.460 --> 09:40.580]  Also, this makes me talk about analog controllers
[09:40.580 --> 09:42.420]  over digital controllers.
[09:43.300 --> 09:45.020]  If you're buying digital controllers,
[09:45.020 --> 09:47.900]  make sure they have a backup battery.
[09:47.900 --> 09:51.220]  Those analog timers, when, so think about this,
[09:51.220 --> 09:52.180]  the power goes out, right?
[09:52.180 --> 09:53.940]  So normally your lights are supposed to come on.
[09:53.940 --> 09:55.420]  We talked about earlier, they'll come on at eight
[09:55.420 --> 09:57.180]  in the morning, they'll go off at eight at night.
[09:57.180 --> 09:58.980]  And you've got one of those timers that spins,
[09:58.980 --> 10:00.940]  that you just push down the buttons
[10:00.940 --> 10:03.220]  to make the timer come on and off.
[10:03.220 --> 10:06.020]  When the power goes out, that thing quits spinning.
[10:06.020 --> 10:07.420]  So now your time is off.
[10:07.420 --> 10:08.860]  It doesn't know what time it is anymore.
[10:08.860 --> 10:10.660]  When the power comes back on,
[10:10.660 --> 10:12.740]  that thing's going to be wherever it was.
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.780]  So if you were three hours and 17 minutes
[10:14.780 --> 10:15.940]  into your flowering period,
[10:15.940 --> 10:17.540]  that's where you are now when that came on
[10:17.540 --> 10:19.860]  and your whole cycle just changed.
[10:19.860 --> 10:23.100]  Every time that power intermittently kicks on and off,
[10:23.100 --> 10:24.180]  your timer moves a little bit.
[10:24.180 --> 10:26.020]  The lights come on, the timer spins a little bit,
[10:26.020 --> 10:26.860]  and then it goes back out
[10:26.860 --> 10:28.580]  and you've got seven more minutes of daylight
[10:28.580 --> 10:30.420]  just happened in that grow room.
[10:30.420 --> 10:31.300]  When the power goes out
[10:31.300 --> 10:32.660]  and I know it's going to keep fucking up,
[10:32.660 --> 10:34.900]  I just go unplug everything.
[10:34.900 --> 10:37.260]  Fuck it, I don't need it coming off and on and off and on.
[10:37.260 --> 10:38.100]  You don't want to hear
[10:38.100 --> 10:41.460]  kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom,
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.620]  of your blowers and air conditioners firing up
[10:43.620 --> 10:44.460]  and getting unplugged.
[10:44.460 --> 10:45.660]  And then right as they start to die out,
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.500]  the power comes again
[10:46.500 --> 10:48.460]  because the power guy's working on the line,
[10:48.460 --> 10:49.820]  pushing the power together.
[10:49.820 --> 10:50.960]  Like whatever they're doing up there,
[10:50.960 --> 10:52.200]  they're making it off and on.
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.380]  I don't want to mess up my stuff.
[10:53.380 --> 10:54.940]  So think about that timer,
[10:54.940 --> 10:56.340]  stop spinning and start spinning.
[10:56.340 --> 10:59.540]  If you had a digital timer in there with a battery backup,
[10:59.540 --> 11:01.700]  when the power went out in your house,
[11:01.700 --> 11:04.240]  the timer will remain on the same time
[11:04.240 --> 11:07.100]  so that your cycles do not get interrupted.
[11:07.100 --> 11:09.780]  That's something that's really advantageous.
[11:09.780 --> 11:11.280]  But with a lot of digital stuff,
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.240]  with a lot of programming comes the other caveat
[11:14.240 --> 11:15.220]  of when the power goes out,
[11:15.220 --> 11:18.340]  how much of that stuff is going to fail you?
[11:18.340 --> 11:20.220]  That's kind of why I keep grow rooms super simple.
[11:20.220 --> 11:23.540]  You guys, I run pots of soil that I hand water.
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.820]  Basically I've got lights and air conditioner
[11:25.820 --> 11:26.900]  and a couple of blowers
[11:26.900 --> 11:29.220]  are all that I really rely on for electricity.
[11:29.940 --> 11:32.140]  Everything else in my personal grow, I do by hand.
[11:32.140 --> 11:33.260]  At a large grow facility,
[11:33.260 --> 11:34.740]  I hope you're automating a lot of stuff,
[11:34.740 --> 11:37.180]  but I hope you've got a backup plan also.
[11:37.180 --> 11:38.060]  All right, so that's my talk
[11:38.060 --> 11:40.820]  about how the snow fucked everybody up.
[11:40.820 --> 11:42.980]  Think about those analog and digital timers, you guys.
[11:42.980 --> 11:44.260]  When you go to buy a timer next time,
[11:44.260 --> 11:46.540]  get a digital timer with a battery backup.
[11:46.540 --> 11:48.100]  That way when the power goes out,
[11:48.100 --> 11:49.780]  your whole cycle doesn't get fucked up.
[11:49.780 --> 11:51.260]  And when the power starts going out,
[11:51.260 --> 11:53.140]  coming back off and on and stuff,
[11:53.140 --> 11:54.380]  just go and plug everything.
[11:54.380 --> 11:56.920]  Your plants will survive for a little while in the dark
[11:56.920 --> 11:57.980]  without any interruptions.
[11:57.980 --> 11:59.740]  It's probably better for your equipment,
[11:59.740 --> 12:02.760]  your plants, your power bill, all that good stuff.
[12:02.760 --> 12:05.180]  If you're not sucking up a bunch of random power
[12:05.180 --> 12:06.500]  at random intervals.
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.940]  And it probably freaks your plants out anyway.
[12:07.940 --> 12:09.900]  It'd be like, how come we just got four minutes of light
[12:09.900 --> 12:11.260]  and then it went dark again?
[12:11.260 --> 12:12.100]  That sucks.
[12:12.100 --> 12:13.620]  The only thing you're gonna have to worry about,
[12:13.620 --> 12:14.540]  it got cold here.
[12:14.540 --> 12:15.700]  My plants were getting cold.
[12:15.700 --> 12:16.540]  I could see it.
[12:16.540 --> 12:17.920]  I was cold.
[12:17.920 --> 12:19.460]  There's nothing I could really do about that
[12:19.460 --> 12:20.560]  that I could think of.
[12:21.540 --> 12:23.780]  Yeah, and this is gonna burn a fucking fire in the house.
[12:23.780 --> 12:25.180]  There's not much I could really do about that.
[12:25.180 --> 12:26.140]  And I don't have a fireplace here,
[12:26.140 --> 12:27.100]  so that was not an option.
[12:27.100 --> 12:29.300]  Also humidity was building up in one room.
[12:29.300 --> 12:31.180]  All I did was just open the doors
[12:31.180 --> 12:33.140]  and just let the air move around a little bit.
[12:33.140 --> 12:35.280]  So it wasn't that big of a deal.
[12:35.280 --> 12:37.180]  You can interrupt that day cycle,
[12:37.180 --> 12:41.160]  but please do not interrupt your night cycles.
[12:43.980 --> 12:45.980]  All right, you guys, I've been rambling for like 12 minutes
[12:45.980 --> 12:46.940]  and I still need a fresh drink.
[12:46.940 --> 12:47.940]  So I'm gonna hit pause.
[12:47.940 --> 12:50.140]  I'm gonna take a drink, fix what's going on in my throat
[12:50.140 --> 12:52.100]  and I'll be right back.
[12:52.100 --> 12:53.780]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[12:53.780 --> 12:54.760]  I'm well hydrated.
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.460]  Of course I took a couple of fat dabs
[12:56.820 --> 12:58.140]  while I had the microphone turned off.
[12:58.140 --> 12:59.980]  That way nobody could hear me coughing.
[12:59.980 --> 13:00.900]  What was I dabbing?
[13:00.900 --> 13:01.980]  Let's see, I took some of this.
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.020]  I've got some live resin, some Clementine live resin.
[13:05.020 --> 13:05.840]  It's kind of battery.
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.680]  It's kind of buttery.
[13:06.680 --> 13:07.540]  It's a little thick.
[13:07.540 --> 13:08.740]  It tastes super delicious,
[13:08.740 --> 13:11.580]  but it does not give me enough effect.
[13:11.580 --> 13:13.180]  It doesn't give me the head buzz that I want.
[13:13.180 --> 13:15.060]  It doesn't make me high like I wanna be.
[13:15.060 --> 13:16.200]  It's good morning hash.
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.420]  If you wanna get a little bit buzzed
[13:18.420 --> 13:20.300]  first thing in the morning and not ruin your whole day,
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.580]  this Clementine is amazing.
[13:21.580 --> 13:23.360]  And it's also kind of like drinking some orange juice
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.780]  in the morning, super great flavor.
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.980]  But since it doesn't get me where I wanna be,
[13:27.980 --> 13:32.220]  I take a decent sized chunk of the Clementine live resin.
[13:32.220 --> 13:36.740]  And then I think the Clementine live resin came from,
[13:36.740 --> 13:38.780]  I'm pretty sure that was TR Extracts.
[13:38.780 --> 13:41.900]  I picked it up at Three Rivers Organics.
[13:41.900 --> 13:44.180]  So shout out to all of those folks.
[13:44.180 --> 13:46.780]  And also I've been taking Golden Goat Shatter.
[13:46.780 --> 13:48.500]  The Golden Goat was grown by myself
[13:48.500 --> 13:50.580]  and extracted by our friend, the Barefoot Grower,
[13:50.580 --> 13:53.100]  the Barefoot Extracts is who he is right now.
[13:53.100 --> 13:56.300]  He was the Barefoot Grower, the Barefoot Glassblower.
[13:56.300 --> 13:58.380]  Then he, now he's Barefoot Extracts,
[13:58.380 --> 14:02.060]  is gonna be the Barefoot Husband pretty soon.
[14:02.060 --> 14:03.520]  Yeah, but he makes great hash.
[14:03.520 --> 14:06.620]  So I've been smoking the Clementine wrapped up
[14:06.620 --> 14:09.180]  in Golden Goat Shatter, making little Terp Tacos.
[14:09.180 --> 14:12.420]  The Golden Goat certainly does give me the head buzz I want.
[14:12.420 --> 14:14.120]  The citrus flavor of the Golden Goat,
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.980]  that sweet citrusy tropical flavor
[14:17.980 --> 14:19.400]  mixed with the Clementine.
[14:19.400 --> 14:21.340]  Oh man, that is a super delicious stab.
[14:22.220 --> 14:26.460]  Obviously it puts me in a nice rambly talkative headspace.
[14:26.460 --> 14:27.780]  So shout out to everybody involved there.
[14:27.780 --> 14:30.460]  Three Rivers Organics, Apothecary.
[14:30.460 --> 14:31.620]  Was it Apothecary or TR?
[14:31.620 --> 14:32.940]  Whoever made this, he did a good job.
[14:32.940 --> 14:35.300]  I was also earlier today dabbing some Lemon Jeffrey
[14:35.300 --> 14:36.620]  and that was made by Apothecary.
[14:36.620 --> 14:37.800]  So shout out to them.
[14:37.800 --> 14:40.260]  I was also putting the Lemon Jeffrey in the Golden Goat
[14:40.260 --> 14:42.980]  because I've got a little bit of this Golden Goat Shatter
[14:42.980 --> 14:44.720]  and it really does great things to my head.
[14:44.720 --> 14:45.600]  I really enjoy it.
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.740]  I was also smoking on some Kalonji Kush
[14:48.740 --> 14:50.260]  mixed with Zac Hayes Shatter
[14:50.260 --> 14:54.980]  that came out super clear, super gold, super shattery.
[14:54.980 --> 14:56.560]  Really nice dabs with that.
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.760]  Great work to our friend Barefoot.
[14:58.760 --> 15:01.160]  If you're not in Colorado, if you're not in a legal state,
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.320]  I apologize for rubbing it into your face,
[15:03.320 --> 15:05.200]  all the good shit that I get to smoke.
[15:05.200 --> 15:06.660]  All you gotta do is come to Colorado,
[15:06.660 --> 15:08.200]  we will smoke with you.
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.980]  If you're watching the video that I'm making,
[15:09.980 --> 15:10.980]  the reason the camera just moved
[15:10.980 --> 15:11.820]  is because I was making sure
[15:11.820 --> 15:14.580]  I was recording the audio track.
[15:14.580 --> 15:15.740]  Yes, I did mention video.
[15:15.740 --> 15:18.940]  I have been recording most of the new episodes onto video.
[15:18.940 --> 15:20.660]  I've purchased an iPad
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.080]  and I'm recording everything directly
[15:22.080 --> 15:23.380]  onto the iPad with the video.
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.340]  I'm running iRig from my recording software into the iPad
[15:26.340 --> 15:29.540]  so that everything is a quality audio recording.
[15:29.540 --> 15:31.260]  I'm putting all of the videos up to YouTube,
[15:31.260 --> 15:33.220]  but I'm going very slowly about it.
[15:33.220 --> 15:35.360]  And I'm also putting them up in order.
[15:35.360 --> 15:37.960]  So right now, episodes one through 30 are up there.
[15:37.960 --> 15:40.180]  I think you guys are able to see one through 25.
[15:40.180 --> 15:42.500]  Once I get one through 50, I'll release those.
[15:42.500 --> 15:44.760]  Then I'll put the next 25 up.
[15:44.760 --> 15:46.600]  The first few videos are not gonna be that good.
[15:46.600 --> 15:48.420]  I'm just making them to get them caught up
[15:48.940 --> 15:51.080]  so that the old episodes will always be available.
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.080]  YouTube does not limit how many videos you post.
[15:54.080 --> 15:57.140]  So I can put all 200 episodes of the podcast up on YouTube
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.820]  and they will be kept there always and forever
[15:58.820 --> 16:00.820]  until they take them down for copyright violations
[16:00.820 --> 16:02.000]  for having music in the background,
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.100]  which I hope doesn't ever happen, but it could.
[16:04.100 --> 16:04.940]  That could happen.
[16:04.940 --> 16:07.060]  But a lot of people ask for the old episodes.
[16:07.060 --> 16:08.900]  And I've been putting out those chunks of old episodes
[16:08.900 --> 16:10.900]  on Thursdays with three and four episodes,
[16:10.900 --> 16:12.300]  but that's just messing up the feed
[16:12.300 --> 16:13.900]  and making more shit fall out of the feed
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.820]  so more episodes are disappearing.
[16:15.820 --> 16:18.340]  So I'm just gonna put them up on YouTube.
[16:19.140 --> 16:19.980]  This video will end up on YouTube.
[16:19.980 --> 16:20.800]  It'll be a long time.
[16:20.800 --> 16:21.640]  This is episode 203.
[16:21.640 --> 16:23.940]  I'm only up to like 32 that I've made.
[16:23.940 --> 16:25.680]  So it's gonna be a little while, you guys.
[16:25.680 --> 16:27.340]  But since I'm making them live while I'm doing them now,
[16:27.340 --> 16:28.680]  hopefully that speeds me up.
[16:28.680 --> 16:31.220]  Anyway, if you can't watch on video, I apologize.
[16:31.220 --> 16:32.060]  Stick around.
[16:32.060 --> 16:32.880]  You're not missing anything.
[16:32.880 --> 16:35.460]  All you see is my rambling face.
[16:35.460 --> 16:36.740]  Nothing special.
[16:36.740 --> 16:39.340]  All right, obviously I'm super duper high.
[16:39.340 --> 16:43.260]  And I forgot to mention why green lights are okay.
[16:43.260 --> 16:46.140]  In the past segment, I talked about using green lights
[16:46.140 --> 16:48.220]  when you go into the grow room during the night cycle.
[16:49.060 --> 16:49.900]  Why are green lights okay?
[16:49.900 --> 16:50.720]  Why is a green light special?
[16:50.720 --> 16:52.820]  Why can't I use a purple or a blue?
[16:52.820 --> 16:56.300]  Let me explain it briefly and quickly and really simply.
[16:56.300 --> 16:58.020]  Cannabis plants are green.
[16:58.020 --> 16:59.660]  They do not absorb green light.
[16:59.660 --> 17:01.380]  The green light doesn't affect them in any way.
[17:01.380 --> 17:02.220]  They don't even see it.
[17:02.220 --> 17:03.320]  They don't know it's there.
[17:03.320 --> 17:04.180]  It's magic.
[17:04.180 --> 17:05.660]  For some reason, since they're green,
[17:05.660 --> 17:06.720]  they don't absorb green light,
[17:06.720 --> 17:08.460]  they don't reflect green light.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.900]  It doesn't hurt them.
[17:09.900 --> 17:10.980]  That's why green is okay.
[17:10.980 --> 17:13.700]  That's the quick and easy reason why.
[17:13.700 --> 17:15.100]  Because they are green also.
[17:16.140 --> 17:17.980]  I hope that works for you, because that's why.
[17:18.700 --> 17:20.860]  A few episodes ago on 420, actually,
[17:20.860 --> 17:22.860]  on the 420 episode, I wanted to know,
[17:22.860 --> 17:24.020]  I asked my listeners,
[17:24.020 --> 17:26.080]  what are you listening to when you smoke?
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.860]  When you get dabbed out, when you smoke a blunt,
[17:27.860 --> 17:29.220]  when you smoke some flowers,
[17:29.220 --> 17:32.080]  when you smoke whatever your preferred smoking device
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.140]  or delivery method is,
[17:33.140 --> 17:35.020]  when you get done getting nice and blazed,
[17:35.020 --> 17:38.260]  what kind of music do you listen to?
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.980]  I got a lot of great responses.
[17:39.980 --> 17:42.640]  Our friend Barry O, who's been a longtime podcast listener,
[17:42.640 --> 17:43.480]  shout out Barry O.
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.760]  Thanks for listening for so long.
[17:44.760 --> 17:45.700]  Thanks for all the support.
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.760]  Thanks for the interaction on social media.
[17:48.540 --> 17:49.380]  Thanks for the emails.
[17:49.380 --> 17:50.200]  Thanks for everything you do
[17:50.200 --> 17:52.360]  for being part of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.200]  part of the crew.
[17:53.200 --> 17:54.040]  Hey, you know what?
[17:54.040 --> 17:55.580]  My listeners need a name.
[17:57.320 --> 17:59.080]  Doug Stanhope has the killer termites.
[17:59.080 --> 18:00.000]  What are my listeners called?
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.140]  Create a name for yourselves, guys.
[18:01.140 --> 18:04.720]  I'd love to know what my followers and listeners are called.
[18:04.720 --> 18:06.640]  So Barry O listens to,
[18:06.640 --> 18:07.880]  when Barry O gets nice and blazed,
[18:07.880 --> 18:10.480]  he likes to listen to Coltrane with Buddy Rich.
[18:10.480 --> 18:11.520]  That Coltrane with Buddy Rich,
[18:11.520 --> 18:12.400]  that's good shit right there.
[18:12.400 --> 18:13.300]  I'm a drummer.
[18:13.300 --> 18:16.040]  I know all about some Buddy Rich, some Gene Krupa.
[18:16.040 --> 18:17.680]  Man, wasn't Buddy Rich an asshole?
[18:18.400 --> 18:20.640]  Couldn't Buddy Rich smoke a joint and chill the fuck out?
[18:20.640 --> 18:22.800]  Buddy Rich was one of the best drummers on the planet.
[18:22.800 --> 18:26.760]  He wore a full suit jacket, a tie,
[18:26.760 --> 18:29.360]  and played faster and harder than I can ever do.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.960]  He played longer shows than I can play.
[18:30.960 --> 18:32.740]  The old man would be covered in fucking sweat.
[18:32.740 --> 18:34.200]  He played till he was over 70.
[18:34.200 --> 18:35.980]  He was probably 80 years old.
[18:35.980 --> 18:37.080]  He's passed.
[18:37.080 --> 18:38.320]  Rest in peace, Mr. Buddy Rich.
[18:38.320 --> 18:40.840]  But holy shit, that dude could play some drums,
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.860]  but I've heard recordings of him yelling at his band.
[18:43.860 --> 18:47.380]  If one band member missed one note in that show,
[18:48.080 --> 18:48.900]  when they got back on the bus,
[18:48.900 --> 18:51.220]  Buddy Rich would chew out that band.
[18:51.220 --> 18:52.660]  He would cuss at them and make them feel
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.740]  like the dumbest pieces of shit on the planet.
[18:54.740 --> 18:57.260]  I think Buddy Rich needed to smoke a fucking joint.
[18:57.260 --> 18:59.020]  Maybe he wouldn't have been the aggressive, crazy,
[18:59.020 --> 19:00.980]  angry, fast drummer that he was,
[19:00.980 --> 19:02.940]  but man, it would have helped him out a lot.
[19:02.940 --> 19:04.660]  Maybe that's why some of those other guys were fucking up.
[19:04.660 --> 19:06.660]  Maybe they did smoke a little too much weed there.
[19:06.660 --> 19:08.020]  Just feeling it.
[19:08.020 --> 19:09.600]  Buddy Rich was a badass drummer.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.400]  Buddy Rich and Coltrane, that's some cool shit.
[19:11.400 --> 19:13.700]  I may go listen to some of that in the car
[19:13.700 --> 19:14.540]  a little bit later here,
[19:14.540 --> 19:15.760]  because I just like that feeling in the car.
[19:15.800 --> 19:17.000]  You get driving, you get that,
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.500]  the horns going and the drums.
[19:19.720 --> 19:21.600]  Yeah, I love some good jazzy shit like that.
[19:21.600 --> 19:23.560]  So Barrio likes to listen to some Coltrane
[19:23.560 --> 19:24.920]  with Buddy Rich when he gets high,
[19:24.920 --> 19:27.760]  but also he's gonna make a huge switch.
[19:27.760 --> 19:29.440]  He also likes to listen to Bad Brains.
[19:29.440 --> 19:30.920]  That's very versatile.
[19:30.920 --> 19:31.840]  You got some punk feel.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.920]  You got a reggae feel there.
[19:33.920 --> 19:37.480]  Bad Brains was a punk band who became Rastafarians.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.840]  So there's a nice, that's kinda,
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.520]  I hate to say it, but Sublime kinda rips off
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.100]  Bad Brains a little bit.
[19:43.100 --> 19:44.080]  I'll give him that.
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.240]  Also the Misfits.
[19:45.720 --> 19:46.680]  Yeah, you can't be an old punk fan
[19:46.680 --> 19:47.920]  if you don't listen to the Misfits.
[19:47.920 --> 19:49.280]  Everybody knows, all right, you guys,
[19:49.280 --> 19:51.360]  you see that black T-shirt with the skull on it?
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.480]  All you hipster kids, all you young fuckers,
[19:53.480 --> 19:55.440]  that black shirt with the white skull on it,
[19:55.440 --> 19:57.120]  that's the Misfits.
[19:57.120 --> 19:59.400]  They were a band a long time ago.
[19:59.400 --> 20:00.960]  You should probably check them out.
[20:00.960 --> 20:03.040]  If you got black hair and you're wearing
[20:03.040 --> 20:04.800]  your sister's pants, definitely go listen
[20:04.800 --> 20:07.680]  to the Misfits and learn where the fuck it all came from.
[20:07.680 --> 20:09.800]  And then you said Pennywise.
[20:09.800 --> 20:11.340]  Pennywise is good shit, dude.
[20:11.340 --> 20:14.840]  That's not quite up my alley, but that's good shit.
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.920]  The Misfits, Pennywise, Bad Brains, that is good shit.
[20:16.920 --> 20:19.320]  I would never put it on, but in the circles
[20:19.320 --> 20:21.160]  I used to hang with and friends that I used to hang out with,
[20:21.160 --> 20:23.160]  there was a lot of that type of stuff.
[20:23.160 --> 20:25.200]  I had a friend who was way into Bad Religion,
[20:25.200 --> 20:27.560]  which also fell into that category.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.200]  My favorite, that's not my kind of music,
[20:29.200 --> 20:32.920]  but one of my favorites in that realm would be No Effects.
[20:32.920 --> 20:35.640]  I just liked the tone of their drums.
[20:35.640 --> 20:37.920]  A lot of these bands have terrible sounding drums
[20:37.920 --> 20:39.760]  on the recordings, and being a drummer,
[20:39.760 --> 20:41.720]  it disappoints me when the guitar sounds like
[20:41.720 --> 20:43.040]  sh-sh-sh-sh-sh, and it's good,
[20:43.040 --> 20:44.640]  and the bass is like, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,
[20:45.440 --> 20:46.280]  but then the drums sound like you're hitting
[20:46.280 --> 20:47.600]  the fucking, the desk.
[20:47.600 --> 20:49.920]  Like, tune the goddamn drums and record them right.
[20:49.920 --> 20:51.860]  No Effects always had the drums sounding good,
[20:51.860 --> 20:52.800]  in my opinion.
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.240]  Big huge shout out to the song Shower Days,
[20:56.240 --> 20:57.440]  that's right, from No Effects.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.080]  Tuesdays and Saturdays, also known as Shower Days,
[21:00.080 --> 21:01.920]  that used to be how I rolled.
[21:01.920 --> 21:04.440]  So, I'm rambling on about Berrio's tweet about music,
[21:04.440 --> 21:05.780]  but dude, thanks for the input.
[21:05.780 --> 21:08.080]  I like to know what people are listening to.
[21:08.080 --> 21:10.700]  You guys, it's never too late to send me a tweet
[21:10.700 --> 21:11.540]  or a message.
[21:11.540 --> 21:13.680]  Let me know what you like to listen to when you get high,
[21:13.680 --> 21:14.960]  when you smoke, when you medicate,
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.540]  what kind of music do you put on?
[21:16.540 --> 21:18.520]  Are you one of those guys that, the cliche guy,
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.920]  do you put on some Pink Floyd and sit back and zone out?
[21:20.920 --> 21:22.800]  Do you like to watch Cheech and Chong movies?
[21:22.800 --> 21:25.200]  Let me know what entertains you when you get high.
[21:25.200 --> 21:26.960]  I also wanna know what you're eating.
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.200]  Also, a follow-up question, how are you smoking it?
[21:30.200 --> 21:31.960]  Do you prefer a blunt, do you prefer a bong,
[21:31.960 --> 21:33.360]  do you like to take dabs?
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.560]  Let me know, what's your favorite delivery method?
[21:35.560 --> 21:36.640]  I know I ask a lot of questions,
[21:36.640 --> 21:38.600]  but I appreciate the interaction.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.280]  All right, I've got another email.
[21:40.280 --> 21:42.920]  This one is a little long and a little wordy,
[21:42.960 --> 21:44.120]  but I think it's worth the read.
[21:44.120 --> 21:45.360]  So hang in here with me.
[21:45.360 --> 21:47.080]  And it goes like this.
[21:47.080 --> 21:49.920]  While my email handle, should I even say that out loud?
[21:49.920 --> 21:51.040]  I don't know if I'm supposed to say that.
[21:51.040 --> 21:53.760]  This person has a very unique email.
[21:53.760 --> 21:54.600]  You know what, I'm just gonna say it
[21:54.600 --> 21:55.600]  because it's part of the email.
[21:55.600 --> 21:57.520]  While my email handle, Catalina Belmar,
[21:57.520 --> 21:59.800]  may evoke visions of a young Barcelona beauty,
[21:59.800 --> 22:02.340]  the real author of this email is an old, bald man
[22:02.340 --> 22:03.680]  living in a prohibition state
[22:03.680 --> 22:06.000]  that rarely has the opportunity to indulge,
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.040]  but who dreams of his occasional forays
[22:08.040 --> 22:09.320]  into the mountains of Colorado
[22:09.320 --> 22:11.760]  and the opportunity to partake of the herbal medicine
[22:11.760 --> 22:13.800]  available back home.
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.960]  Golden Goat from Earls of Leadville last autumn
[22:15.960 --> 22:19.280]  was my favorite, was my last favorite
[22:19.280 --> 22:21.200]  while climbing a couple of 14ers nearby.
[22:21.200 --> 22:22.280]  Sorry for the stutter there.
[22:22.280 --> 22:24.160]  This is not written like a normal email.
[22:24.160 --> 22:26.720]  This is very poetic, and there's a lot of stuff
[22:26.720 --> 22:27.960]  to adjust to in the reading here.
[22:27.960 --> 22:29.100]  The rhythm is not my style,
[22:29.100 --> 22:31.680]  so it took me three or four reads to figure it out,
[22:31.680 --> 22:32.820]  but I like the way it's worded,
[22:32.820 --> 22:34.200]  so I'm gonna read it to you.
[22:34.200 --> 22:36.800]  He goes on to say, I too enjoy listening to reggae
[22:36.800 --> 22:38.440]  and the Grateful Dead and Phish.
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.680]  I lean toward older reggae,
[22:39.680 --> 22:42.680]  having had the opportunity to attend Bob Marley concerts
[22:42.680 --> 22:44.340]  twice in my younger days.
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.420]  Bob is the best.
[22:45.420 --> 22:47.560]  Others I like are Tosh, Toots and the Maytals,
[22:47.560 --> 22:50.580]  Mighty Diamonds, Max Romeo, the other Marleys,
[22:50.580 --> 22:52.920]  Luton Faya, Natalie Rise.
[22:52.920 --> 22:55.840]  Picked up some Marlon Asher after listening to your show.
[22:55.840 --> 22:57.200]  Bro, we listen to the same stuff.
[22:57.200 --> 22:59.240]  We are loving the same stuff.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.140]  I don't listen to Bob Marley as much as I could
[23:01.140 --> 23:04.280]  or probably should because it's just so overplayed,
[23:04.280 --> 23:06.960]  and it bugs me when people see that I have dreadlocks
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.640]  and they go, oh, I love Bob Marley.
[23:09.200 --> 23:10.660]  It kind of burns it out for me,
[23:10.660 --> 23:11.800]  so I listen to a lot of other stuff,
[23:11.800 --> 23:14.340]  but we listen to a lot of the same stuff.
[23:14.340 --> 23:16.740]  Kind of jealous that you saw Bob Marley in concert.
[23:16.740 --> 23:17.640]  I bet that was amazing.
[23:17.640 --> 23:18.720]  I've seen plenty of video,
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.360]  and the dude was powerful on stage.
[23:20.360 --> 23:22.360]  I would love to have been in his presence.
[23:22.360 --> 23:24.240]  That would have been awesome.
[23:24.240 --> 23:26.560]  You would really enjoy Steel Pulse.
[23:26.560 --> 23:28.560]  By the bands you listed here,
[23:28.560 --> 23:29.760]  I'm sure you know about Steel Pulse,
[23:29.760 --> 23:30.800]  but check out some Steel Pulse.
[23:30.800 --> 23:33.760]  Also, check out Morgan Heritage,
[23:33.760 --> 23:36.240]  Dennis Morgan's grandchildren and children.
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.760]  Also, if you're gonna go that route,
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.120]  check out Jamiri Morgan.
[23:40.120 --> 23:41.920]  That's the new generation of Morgans,
[23:41.920 --> 23:44.720]  but Morgan Heritage definitely falls into the stuff
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.480]  of good reggae that I think you would enjoy.
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.600]  I'm gonna go on with your email.
[23:47.600 --> 23:49.400]  It says, you mentioned Government Mule.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.780]  If you haven't heard Mule's dub side of the Mule,
[23:51.780 --> 23:52.920]  you're missing a great one.
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.680]  The Mule is joined by Toots Hibbert
[23:54.680 --> 23:56.800]  for a real reggae Mule style.
[23:56.800 --> 23:58.280]  Dude, I love Government Mule.
[23:58.280 --> 23:59.760]  I love Warren Haynes.
[23:59.760 --> 24:02.320]  I can't get into that dub side album for some reason.
[24:02.320 --> 24:03.600]  I like the dub side of the Moon.
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.440]  That's a really cool one,
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.200]  but the dub side of the Mule just doesn't do it for me.
[24:07.200 --> 24:08.120]  Not to sound like an asshole,
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.680]  but Toots is not my favorite reggae artist,
[24:10.680 --> 24:14.840]  which is probably a bunch of Rastas and reggae fans
[24:14.840 --> 24:16.440]  probably just slapped themselves right in the forehead
[24:16.440 --> 24:17.680]  and went, what?
[24:17.680 --> 24:18.600]  That's not my thing.
[24:18.600 --> 24:20.600]  I like the more, I don't know,
[24:20.600 --> 24:22.920]  the more reggae feeling reggae.
[24:22.920 --> 24:24.680]  Toots is great, just not my favorite.
[24:24.680 --> 24:26.480]  Don't get me wrong, I fucking love Toots.
[24:26.480 --> 24:28.160]  I've seen him in concert several times,
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.560]  just not my favorite.
[24:29.560 --> 24:31.280]  All right, he goes on to say,
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.040]  Jamgrass with artists such as Yonder Mountain String Band,
[24:34.600 --> 24:35.680]  Horseshoes and Hand Grenades.
[24:35.680 --> 24:37.200]  Oh, the band is called Horseshoes and Hand Grenades.
[24:37.200 --> 24:38.240]  Sorry, it's hard to read.
[24:38.240 --> 24:40.160]  Green Sky Bluegrass are also favorites
[24:40.160 --> 24:42.520]  when driving Colorado mountains.
[24:42.520 --> 24:44.440]  Yes, Yonder Mountain's always good for driving.
[24:44.440 --> 24:45.960]  I've actually played Yonder Mountain on the show.
[24:45.960 --> 24:47.600]  I played Granny Won't You Smoke Some Marijuana
[24:47.600 --> 24:49.280]  when I had the dab in Granny on here.
[24:49.280 --> 24:50.120]  Yonder's good.
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.040]  I can't get too much into the bluegrass.
[24:53.480 --> 24:54.800]  When I lived in Lawrence, Kansas,
[24:54.800 --> 24:57.480]  I hung out with a girl who was a huge bluegrass fan.
[24:57.480 --> 24:59.120]  And if there was reggae at one bar
[24:59.120 --> 25:00.320]  and bluegrass at another bar,
[25:00.320 --> 25:01.760]  we knew we weren't hanging out that night.
[25:01.760 --> 25:03.880]  I knew that she was gonna go see bluegrass
[25:04.720 --> 25:05.560]  and I was gonna go check out reggae.
[25:05.560 --> 25:06.400]  But at the end of the night,
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.240]  we'd end up at the same place
[25:07.240 --> 25:08.760]  wherever the Cosmopolitics were playing.
[25:08.760 --> 25:10.800]  Shout out to the Cosmopolitics.
[25:10.800 --> 25:11.760]  This email goes on to say,
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.400]  Grateful Dead and Phish are of course mainstays.
[25:14.400 --> 25:15.240]  Of course, yes.
[25:15.240 --> 25:16.080]  Phish and the Grateful Dead
[25:16.080 --> 25:18.000]  are always gonna be my two favorite bands.
[25:18.000 --> 25:18.840]  And then he says,
[25:18.840 --> 25:22.080]  try Holly Boling playing Phish's Tahoe Tweezer
[25:22.080 --> 25:23.400]  on piano sometime.
[25:23.400 --> 25:26.080]  So apparently there's an artist named Holly Boling
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.640]  who plays a song called Tweezer on piano.
[25:30.640 --> 25:31.560]  So I'm gonna have to check that out.
[25:31.560 --> 25:33.280]  Holly Boling playing Tweezer on piano.
[25:33.640 --> 25:34.480]  You guys, if you're Phish kids
[25:34.480 --> 25:35.440]  and you're listening to this,
[25:35.440 --> 25:37.100]  go check that out for me.
[25:37.100 --> 25:38.440]  Google it, send me a link.
[25:38.440 --> 25:39.940]  Let me know what you think.
[25:39.940 --> 25:40.780]  He also says,
[25:40.780 --> 25:42.240]  I hope to catch you on your mountain string band
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.500]  with Government Mule at Red Rocks this summer.
[25:44.500 --> 25:45.540]  Yeah, that's gonna be a cool show.
[25:45.540 --> 25:46.720]  I'm not planning on going to that.
[25:46.720 --> 25:49.340]  There's a chance I may end up at that show.
[25:49.340 --> 25:50.180]  Let me know if you go.
[25:50.180 --> 25:51.000]  I'll let you know if I go.
[25:51.000 --> 25:51.840]  We'll link up.
[25:51.840 --> 25:52.660]  We'll take some dabs together
[25:52.660 --> 25:54.840]  and smoke some iRegenetics grown flowers.
[25:54.840 --> 25:56.100]  That'll be fucking awesome.
[25:56.100 --> 25:57.000]  The email goes on to say,
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.860]  peace and continue your great streaming
[25:58.860 --> 26:00.380]  of important cannabis related info
[26:00.400 --> 26:02.820]  and entertainment to those of us
[26:02.820 --> 26:06.120]  in prohibition land, signed Catalina.
[26:06.120 --> 26:08.400]  Hey, that's a very uniquely written email.
[26:08.400 --> 26:09.320]  I like the way you write shit.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.440]  You don't talk like normal people.
[26:10.440 --> 26:13.000]  You've got a very poetic way with your email here.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.520]  It sounds like we like a lot of the same music.
[26:14.520 --> 26:17.200]  You may have introduced me to this Holly Boling character
[26:17.200 --> 26:19.000]  that I'm gonna check out.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.140]  And then I may listen to some Yonder Mountain
[26:21.140 --> 26:22.720]  because I haven't listened to that in quite a while.
[26:22.720 --> 26:23.560]  You know what I do listen to?
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.440]  If I was gonna listen to that banjo-y shit,
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.680]  I'd probably put on some leftover salmon
[26:27.680 --> 26:29.040]  or some string cheese incident.
[26:29.060 --> 26:31.060]  I kind of burned myself out on the string cheese incident.
[26:31.060 --> 26:32.100]  In the summer of 2001,
[26:32.100 --> 26:35.040]  I saw a bunch of widespread panic shows
[26:35.040 --> 26:37.180]  and there was a short run there where string cheese
[26:37.180 --> 26:39.500]  and panic were co-headlining shows.
[26:39.500 --> 26:41.420]  They would take one night cheese would headline
[26:41.420 --> 26:42.660]  and the next night panic would headline
[26:42.660 --> 26:44.340]  and they were just open for each other.
[26:44.340 --> 26:45.760]  I saw a whole bunch of string cheese,
[26:45.760 --> 26:46.940]  a whole bunch of widespread panic.
[26:46.940 --> 26:49.140]  And then I went to Bonnaroo and saw string cheese
[26:49.140 --> 26:51.860]  and they sounded like shit.
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.300]  They kind of got it together by the next year,
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.800]  but then I went to Waka Rusa
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.260]  and saw string cheese at Waka Rusa
[26:56.260 --> 26:58.600]  and then it was when they added
[26:58.600 --> 27:00.400]  the new percussion guy, Jason Hahn.
[27:01.480 --> 27:03.200]  I feel like what I used to love
[27:03.200 --> 27:04.280]  about string cheese incident
[27:04.280 --> 27:05.840]  was the way Mike Travis played the drums
[27:05.840 --> 27:07.080]  and percussion at the same time.
[27:07.080 --> 27:08.960]  And I feel when they added the new percussionist,
[27:08.960 --> 27:11.080]  Mike Travis got a little bit lazy
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.640]  and that was what was bringing me.
[27:12.640 --> 27:15.120]  That was what I loved was watching that drummer play.
[27:15.120 --> 27:17.560]  And that keyboard player, keyboardist,
[27:17.560 --> 27:18.640]  I said keyboard playist,
[27:18.640 --> 27:20.280]  but that keyboard player, Kyle Hollingsworth,
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.640]  is pretty fucking good too.
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.640]  But that percussion thing from the drummer was what drew me.
[27:24.660 --> 27:26.420]  And when they changed it, it kind of lost me a little bit.
[27:26.420 --> 27:27.780]  All right, I'm gonna check and make sure that iTunes is,
[27:27.780 --> 27:29.300]  or that GarageBand is still going strong.
[27:29.300 --> 27:32.020]  It's still going, we're 27 minutes into the podcast.
[27:32.020 --> 27:33.100]  Everything is going well.
[27:33.100 --> 27:34.180]  Thanks for listening, guys.
[27:34.180 --> 27:36.700]  I've been rambling a lot this episode.
[27:36.700 --> 27:39.820]  I apologize for all of the rambles.
[27:39.820 --> 27:41.020]  I'm gonna blame all the rambles
[27:41.020 --> 27:43.060]  on the golden goat and Clementine dabs
[27:43.060 --> 27:46.300]  and possibly this bottle of Dr. Pepper here in front of me.
[27:46.300 --> 27:47.580]  Sometimes I get a little caffeinated,
[27:47.580 --> 27:48.860]  get a little dabbed out.
[27:48.860 --> 27:50.800]  My face just likes to start going real fast,
[27:50.800 --> 27:51.640]  but you know what?
[27:51.640 --> 27:52.460]  I think that's good for a podcast.
[27:52.460 --> 27:54.100]  It can't be a problem.
[27:54.980 --> 27:56.220]  All right, you guys, I'm gonna start wrapping up
[27:56.220 --> 27:57.060]  this episode.
[27:57.060 --> 27:57.880]  I know it was a short episode
[27:57.880 --> 27:59.900]  and there was not a whole lot of learning to be done,
[27:59.900 --> 28:01.700]  but it was fun hanging out with you.
[28:01.700 --> 28:03.820]  With the 420 season and the little cold that I had,
[28:03.820 --> 28:05.580]  I did not have a lot of time to put together
[28:05.580 --> 28:06.940]  a super impressive episode,
[28:06.940 --> 28:08.120]  but it was fun hanging out with you guys.
[28:08.120 --> 28:10.000]  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.880]  Big shout out to Catalina and Barry O
[28:12.880 --> 28:14.940]  for their replies to my questions.
[28:14.940 --> 28:16.340]  I hope you guys send me some responses
[28:16.340 --> 28:17.420]  to what you like to smoke on,
[28:17.420 --> 28:18.440]  what you like to snack on,
[28:18.440 --> 28:21.380]  and how your favorite way to medicate goes.
[28:21.380 --> 28:23.060]  I said, how your favorite way goes.
[28:23.080 --> 28:25.680]  Started talking, I didn't know what the fuck I was gonna say
[28:25.680 --> 28:27.080]  that means I need to wrap up the podcast.
[28:27.080 --> 28:29.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be back in seven days
[28:29.320 --> 28:30.560]  with a higher quality episode.
[28:30.560 --> 28:31.700]  I'll also be back on Thursday
[28:31.700 --> 28:34.260]  with a large chunk of old episodes for you.
[28:34.260 --> 28:35.760]  Let me know if you guys are listening to those.
[28:35.760 --> 28:38.060]  I would love to know what you think of the Thursday episodes.
[28:38.060 --> 28:38.900]  Are you enjoying those?
[28:38.900 --> 28:39.840]  Are they a waste of my time?
[28:39.840 --> 28:41.120]  Are they a waste of your time?
[28:41.120 --> 28:42.580]  Are they hard for you to download
[28:42.580 --> 28:43.800]  since they're three hours long?
[28:43.800 --> 28:44.800]  Does that mess up your service?
[28:44.800 --> 28:46.320]  Does it mess up your data?
[28:46.320 --> 28:47.560]  Does it mess up your phone plan?
[28:47.560 --> 28:48.480]  Is it working for you?
[28:48.480 --> 28:50.600]  Is there a better way that I could do that for you?
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.160]  Don't forget, I'm gonna put all the old episodes
[28:52.180 --> 28:54.260]  up on YouTube, so they will be there for you.
[28:54.260 --> 28:56.440]  You just have to be patient with me.
[28:56.440 --> 28:58.020]  Also, don't forget about Patreon, you guys.
[28:58.020 --> 29:00.260]  Patreon is a service where you can contribute
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.620]  to the podcast financially.
[29:01.620 --> 29:03.780]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a dollar

[29:10.420 --> 29:12.260]  And I would certainly appreciate it.

[29:13.780 --> 29:15.420]  is available on iTunes and Stitcher.
[29:15.420 --> 29:16.540]  And like I keep talking about,

[29:20.740 --> 29:22.060]  You can certainly find us.

[29:24.460 --> 29:27.480]  You can stalk me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.

[29:28.400 --> 29:29.600]  You can find me on Facebook.
[29:29.600 --> 29:31.280]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:31.280 --> 29:32.840]  And if you're not into all the social media
[29:32.840 --> 29:34.360]  and you would like to send me an email,
[29:34.360 --> 29:39.280]  you can reach me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:39.280 --> 29:43.400]  I would love to hear from each and every single one of you.
[29:43.400 --> 29:44.700]  I think that's all I've got for you this week,
[29:44.700 --> 29:45.540]  ladies and gentlemen.
[29:45.540 --> 29:46.960]  Thanks for hanging out with me for 30 minutes
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.360]  for a short, brief episode.
[29:48.360 --> 29:49.360]  I hope you learned a little bit
[29:49.360 --> 29:50.960]  about cannabis light cycles.
[29:50.980 --> 29:52.660]  I hope you got to have fun hanging out with me.
[29:52.660 --> 29:55.980]  I will be back in seven days with a fully prepared episode.
[29:55.980 --> 29:58.420]  I hope I get to go post this without any trouble
[29:58.420 --> 29:59.540]  because I don't have any wifi.
[29:59.540 --> 30:01.020]  I may have to drive up to the Starbucks.
[30:01.020 --> 30:03.120]  I may have to go to the office and use their computer,
[30:03.120 --> 30:05.380]  steal some wifi up there to get this show up for you guys.
[30:05.380 --> 30:07.140]  So we're gonna figure that out.
[30:07.140 --> 30:09.340]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend, Rich Melohan.
[30:09.340 --> 30:10.340]  And until next time,
[30:10.340 --> 30:13.100]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
