[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Boo!
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.520]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:02.520 --> 00:07.060]  It is Thursday, it is Halloween, and it is time for episode 476 of the Grow From Your
[00:07.060 --> 00:08.660]  Heart podcast.
[00:08.660 --> 00:12.320]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:12.320 --> 00:17.160]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:17.160 --> 00:24.540]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:24.540 --> 00:28.040]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:28.040 --> 00:33.600]  I've been taking dabs of Fatso Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:33.600 --> 00:37.040]  This is a blend of GMO and Legend OG on the package.
[00:37.040 --> 00:41.040]  The flavor is described as dark roast, garlic, and fuel.
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.180]  I'm just going to agree with that because I am too stoned to argue.
[00:45.180 --> 00:50.500]  I'm really loving the gassy flavor and the pungent aroma from this Fatso Full Spectrum
[00:50.500 --> 00:55.580]  Extract, and it's obviously got me super baked, so big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
[00:55.580 --> 00:58.300]  Labs for the delicious concentrate.
[00:58.300 --> 01:01.860]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few emails from a couple of our friends.
[01:01.860 --> 01:05.560]  Before we get there, I'd like to do a few shout outs to a few people who support us
[01:05.560 --> 01:06.560]  on Patreon.
[01:06.560 --> 01:10.060]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and thank you
[01:10.060 --> 01:11.260]  to our buddy James Brown.
[01:11.260 --> 01:13.820]  How about a big thank you shout out to JM.
[01:13.820 --> 01:17.860]  Of course a giant shout out and a fist bump to Nomi by my guacamole.
[01:17.860 --> 01:21.200]  Of course I always want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to our buddy
[01:21.200 --> 01:22.940]  Stabby McStabberson.
[01:22.940 --> 01:26.180]  A big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to Gabriel.
[01:26.180 --> 01:29.380]  I also want to send a giant thank you shout out to OG Purple Thumb.
[01:29.380 --> 01:33.540]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout
[01:33.540 --> 01:37.900]  out, thank you, and a fist bump to our friend Zoso J.
[01:37.900 --> 01:41.760]  Big fist bump, big thank you, and big shout out to everybody who continues to support
[01:41.760 --> 01:43.420]  the show on Patreon.
[01:43.420 --> 01:49.580]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[01:49.580 --> 01:51.540]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:51.540 --> 01:55.780]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:55.780 --> 01:59.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I did say I was going to read some listener emails.
[01:59.280 --> 02:00.420]  Let's get right to it.
[02:00.420 --> 02:04.700]  The first email in this episode goes just like this.
[02:04.700 --> 02:07.780]  Hey Rasta Jeff, thank you for your podcast.
[02:07.780 --> 02:10.540]  Well, you're welcome and thank you for the great email.
[02:10.540 --> 02:13.180]  It goes on to say, I have a question for you.
[02:13.180 --> 02:15.960]  I have a cocoa based organic grow.
[02:15.960 --> 02:22.480]  My media is cocoa that is heavily amended with crab shell, bone meal, green sand, etc.
[02:22.480 --> 02:28.680]  The media gets recycled and re-amended, then put into 20 gallon fabric pots for veg.
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.340]  I had an issue with a magnesium deficiency because of the recycled cocoa.
[02:33.340 --> 02:37.720]  I have corrected this by re-buffering and soaking the media with mag from cutting edge
[02:37.720 --> 02:40.680]  solutions and adding some dolomite lime.
[02:40.680 --> 02:43.040]  My question is about seedlings and clones.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.700]  Well, let's back up before we get to the question.
[02:45.700 --> 02:50.060]  You are using cocoa, you are trying to stay organic, so you are recycling your cocoa,
[02:50.060 --> 02:54.360]  then you are re-buffering it because you've had what you assume is a magnesium deficiency.
[02:54.360 --> 02:55.880]  That does make sense.
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.100]  In cocoa, those nutrients aren't going to stick around.
[02:58.100 --> 03:02.300]  They rinse out of your media really quickly, so it is very likely you were getting a magnesium
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.380]  deficiency.
[03:03.380 --> 03:05.460]  It sounds like you have corrected that.
[03:05.460 --> 03:06.900]  This is a very unique blend.
[03:06.900 --> 03:11.740]  I don't know anybody else that is using purely cocoa as their base and then amending it with
[03:11.740 --> 03:14.400]  things like crab shell, bone meal, and green sand.
[03:14.400 --> 03:18.160]  Most folks are using some sort of a peat or a soilless mix to add to that.
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.200]  So I find this to be a rather unique mix, but let's focus more on the question.
[03:22.200 --> 03:25.720]  It says, my question is about seedlings and clones.
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.520]  I never had any issues before my magnesium deficiency, but while that was happening,
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.320]  I could not get anything to clone or root.
[03:33.320 --> 03:39.000]  Do you think it's because of the lower cation exchange with the stripped cocoa?
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.040]  Now while you were experiencing this deficiency, which we will assume was probably a calcium
[03:43.040 --> 03:46.480]  and magnesium deficiency, they're usually going to come together.
[03:46.480 --> 03:49.680]  You were having problems getting your clones to root.
[03:49.680 --> 03:53.680]  Now I'm not sure if you mean you were trying to root your clones directly into the cocoa
[03:53.680 --> 03:58.840]  mix because that I would never suggest trying to root clones directly into cocoa.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.300]  That's not something I would do.
[04:00.300 --> 04:04.240]  There are much more options that are much more successful for taking clones.
[04:04.240 --> 04:07.840]  So if that is what is giving you the problem, then I would recommend moving to either an
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.360]  easy cloner or if you're insistent on keeping it organic, you can move right over to the
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.160]  rapid rooters or whatever type of plugs and use the dome setup.
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.140]  But I would not suggest going directly into cocoa to attempt to cut a clone.
[04:21.140 --> 04:22.860]  Now that may not be what you mean.
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.200]  Let's talk the other route.
[04:24.200 --> 04:28.640]  You may be experiencing problems when you were cutting clones into rapid rooters, into
[04:28.640 --> 04:29.640]  a dome.
[04:29.640 --> 04:33.360]  However, you're doing it from these plants which experienced that deficiency and that
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.600]  is very likely.
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.120]  I'm going to assume that you were talking about the clone donor plants were the plants
[04:39.120 --> 04:41.140]  that experienced this deficiency.
[04:41.140 --> 04:42.940]  We took clones from those plants.
[04:42.940 --> 04:45.000]  They were not up to their optimal health.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.560]  So it is very likely that those clones will become stagnant and not root well for you.
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.760]  So I'm going to hope and assume that that is the case.
[04:51.760 --> 04:53.200]  You had that deficiency.
[04:53.200 --> 04:57.440]  You took clones from a plant that was unhealthy and those clones were like, no, I came from
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.860]  an unhealthy environment.
[04:58.860 --> 05:02.400]  I don't have enough of a start to survive this stressful period.
[05:02.400 --> 05:04.480]  And they just burned out and died on you.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.720]  That is probably the case.
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.920]  And it wouldn't matter what your media was.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.600]  If your plants are unhealthy and you take cuts from them, they are probably going to
[05:12.600 --> 05:14.840]  be struggle bud the entire time.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.880]  Now I'm not sure if you were trying to root into the cocoa, which again, I would not suggest.
[05:18.880 --> 05:23.000]  If that is your issue, then I would recommend moving over to the plug or another type of
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.160]  a cloning setup.
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.360]  If you were taking clones from those plants that experienced the deficiencies, I'm going
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.800]  to assume that the problem was unhealthy mother plants.
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.240]  And the only solution is to nurse those plants back to health and then take clones from them
[05:37.240 --> 05:38.240]  again.
[05:38.240 --> 05:42.320]  And hopefully the clones from the healthier mother plants will work better for you.
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.000]  This person did not sign the email with their name, but they said, thanks, Jeff.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Stay lifted.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.720]  I promise you I will stay lifted.
[05:48.720 --> 05:52.960]  If you would like to send me an update to this question, maybe a part two, and let me
[05:52.960 --> 05:57.200]  know if you were trying to clone off of a plant that was unhealthy, or if you were actually
[05:57.200 --> 06:01.560]  trying to clone directly into the amended cocoa, maybe we could sort out your question
[06:01.640 --> 06:04.160]  and get you a more dialed in solution.
[06:04.160 --> 06:08.800]  Either way, I want to thank you for the great email and let's keep moving through the pile
[06:08.800 --> 06:10.240]  of great questions.
[06:10.240 --> 06:13.240]  This next email goes a lot like this.
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.360]  Hey Rasta Jeff.
[06:15.360 --> 06:18.900]  So first of all, I just want to thank you for the podcast, the awesome stuff you're
[06:18.900 --> 06:23.640]  doing with your genetics and the education you're spreading around the world.
[06:23.640 --> 06:28.080]  I'm from pretty much the middle of nowhere, Canada, and it's been surprisingly difficult
[06:28.080 --> 06:30.580]  to get decent, reliable advice.
[06:30.580 --> 06:34.540]  And your show has been one of the best places for me to go.
[06:34.540 --> 06:37.180]  Man, that is a great opening line.
[06:37.180 --> 06:38.740]  First off, they thanked us for the podcast.
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.740]  You are very welcome.
[06:39.740 --> 06:41.740]  Thank you for listening.
[06:41.740 --> 06:43.240]  Awesome stuff I'm doing with the genetics.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.420]  Thank you for noticing.
[06:44.420 --> 06:47.140]  And then the education I'm spreading around the world.
[06:47.140 --> 06:48.520]  That is awesome that you notice.
[06:48.520 --> 06:52.740]  And thank you for listening all the way up there in the middle of nowhere, Canada.
[06:52.740 --> 06:56.580]  And like a lot of people say, it is hard for them to get reliable information.
[06:56.580 --> 07:00.160]  I've mentioned before that a lot of stuff on the internet will steer you in the completely
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.600]  wrong direction.
[07:01.600 --> 07:05.600]  And I do understand that finding reliable, accurate information can be challenging.
[07:05.600 --> 07:07.600]  So I'm glad you have found the show.
[07:07.600 --> 07:08.720]  Let's continue with the message.
[07:08.720 --> 07:14.420]  It says, so far, I've read a few Grow books and Bibles, as well as TLO, and I'm just starting
[07:14.420 --> 07:16.520]  on the Teaming With series.
[07:16.520 --> 07:18.680]  You guys, make sure you check out the Teaming With series.
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.080]  There's Teaming With Microbes, Teaming With Nutrients, and there might be another one
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.080]  that I'm missing.
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.960]  I can't think of it, but let's just keep moving.
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.080]  Aside from all of that, I tend to listen to your show in the afternoons and the Dude Grow
[07:29.080 --> 07:32.600]  show in the mornings while I work in the trades as a painter.
[07:32.600 --> 07:34.640]  Big shout out to our friends at the Dude Grow show.
[07:34.640 --> 07:37.960]  If you're not listening to the Dude Grow show, make sure you find them.
[07:37.960 --> 07:41.880]  Whatever you're listening to my podcast on, the Dude Grow show is available there as well.
[07:41.880 --> 07:43.260]  Just type in Dude Grows.
[07:43.260 --> 07:44.260]  It will pop up.
[07:44.260 --> 07:45.400]  Give them a subscribe.
[07:45.400 --> 07:47.160]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[07:47.160 --> 07:51.360]  So our friend is listening to this podcast in the afternoons and the Dude Grows in the
[07:51.360 --> 07:53.480]  morning while painting.
[07:53.480 --> 07:57.280]  I appreciate that you are getting a cannabis education while you were at work.
[07:57.280 --> 08:01.240]  You were on the clock and you were absorbing useful knowledge, bettering yourself while
[08:01.240 --> 08:02.640]  making a paycheck.
[08:02.640 --> 08:03.800]  Great way to do life.
[08:03.800 --> 08:04.800]  Let's keep moving with the message.
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.680]  It says, on that note, between both shows, I've gotten to dispel a few bad pieces of
[08:09.680 --> 08:12.160]  info I've gotten from people.
[08:12.160 --> 08:17.120]  It seems that in Saskatchewan, our farming culture leads people to be really stubborn
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.320]  and suggestive about their bullshit gardening miracle solutions.
[08:21.320 --> 08:26.300]  Yes, a lot of people do things that their uncle's brother taught them and they don't
[08:26.300 --> 08:27.660]  know why they're doing it.
[08:27.660 --> 08:29.580]  They just heard some shit and they do it.
[08:29.580 --> 08:30.940]  And then I say, why do you do that?
[08:30.940 --> 08:34.820]  And they go, well, my uncle said, and I go, yeah, but do you see any results from it?
[08:34.820 --> 08:38.340]  And they go, well, my uncle said that my brother said that when they did it and there's no
[08:38.340 --> 08:42.080]  real scientific background or no reason, it's just another step.
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.600]  It's probably a waste of time.
[08:43.600 --> 08:46.320]  It may actually be causing more problems than it's helping.
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.760]  So I do see a lot of bullshit gardening miracle solutions.
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.220]  I'm going to keep going with the message.
[08:52.220 --> 08:56.740]  It says, for example, last night I popped into your live feed on Instagram and I asked
[08:56.740 --> 09:01.900]  you about dipping the root ball into boiling water before hanging the plants to dry.
[09:01.900 --> 09:05.260]  You immediately said that that is an old wives tale.
[09:05.260 --> 09:09.220]  Yeah, I hear, I've heard that for a long time now that when you cut down the plant, if you
[09:09.220 --> 09:13.760]  dunk the root ball in boiling water, it makes more trichomes appear on the plant.
[09:13.760 --> 09:15.440]  That doesn't really make any sense.
[09:15.440 --> 09:19.500]  And even if it did work, why would you want a bunch of unripened trichomes?
[09:19.500 --> 09:22.020]  We've had those trichomes on that plant for weeks now.
[09:22.020 --> 09:23.020]  They've been getting ripe.
[09:23.020 --> 09:25.300]  We've been checking them with the scope, making sure they're amber.
[09:25.300 --> 09:29.100]  Why do we want fresh trichomes on there suddenly at the end?
[09:29.100 --> 09:31.600]  Also bullshit, not going to happen.
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.680]  It says, I was also told another trick of watering your plants with carbonated water
[09:36.680 --> 09:38.540]  for extra CO2.
[09:38.540 --> 09:41.660]  And that again is just craziness that doesn't actually work.
[09:41.660 --> 09:43.780]  Yes, that's absolutely accurate.
[09:43.780 --> 09:47.500]  Watering your plants with carbonated water will not increase CO2.
[09:47.500 --> 09:49.160]  The roots do not want CO2.
[09:49.160 --> 09:50.600]  The roots want oxygen.
[09:50.600 --> 09:51.600]  The plants want the CO2.
[09:51.600 --> 09:53.720]  So you're doing that all wrong.
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.560]  These are perfect examples of some of the things that will cause more problems in the
[09:57.560 --> 09:59.240]  grow than they will actually help.
[09:59.240 --> 10:02.840]  So we need to be very careful where we get our information.
[10:02.840 --> 10:03.840]  This message keeps going.
[10:03.840 --> 10:08.640]  It says, but despite all of this, I have managed to keep my first grow from failing and I've
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.760]  got a few BC blueberry plants rocking and I'm just about to flip into flower.
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.160]  I kind of wish I had found your podcast earlier as I would have avoided a few mistakes.
[10:19.160 --> 10:21.320]  It's very okay that you have made a few mistakes.
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.320]  That's how you learn.
[10:22.320 --> 10:24.520]  You know not what not to do next time.
[10:24.520 --> 10:26.280]  You have seen what happens when you do that.
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.000]  So you know, maybe I shouldn't try that again, or maybe I could try that a little differently.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.400]  You learn from your mistakes.
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.160]  I've done a full episode about that.
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.160]  So it's okay to make mistakes, especially at your stage of the learning experience.
[10:38.160 --> 10:39.280]  You're a white belt.
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.240]  You've got a long way to go before you're a black belt.
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.880]  You're going to make a lot more mistakes.
[10:43.880 --> 10:44.880]  So don't be scared.
[10:44.880 --> 10:45.920]  Now let's keep going with the message.
[10:45.920 --> 10:50.800]  It says, anyways, instead of asking you questions about my specific grow, I wanted to pick your
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.320]  brain about a few larger concepts.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.680]  First of all, being a lighting spectrum experiment.
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.500]  I heard you mention that the sun puts the plants to sleep because of the spectrum it
[11:01.500 --> 11:03.720]  generates throughout the day.
[11:03.720 --> 11:06.800]  So let's say you rigged up three lights with dimmer switches.
[11:06.800 --> 11:09.600]  One light with the blue spectrum comes on using the dimmer.
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.200]  As it gets brighter, the middle light with the white spectrum turns on.
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.640]  While the blue spectrum dims off, a red spectrum light comes on.
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.840]  Then as the day goes on, the white light dims off, leaving only the red spectrum, which
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.260]  again will shut off using the dimmer toward the end of the day.
[11:25.260 --> 11:29.440]  I am new to your podcast, but has this been covered on an episode of yours?
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.360]  If not, are there any advantages of trying this?
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.480]  Now let's talk a little bit about what this person is referring to.
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.080]  In a previous episode, I have talked about far red light spectrums.
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.240]  As the sun sets, it puts off a spectrum, what is called far red.
[11:46.240 --> 11:53.280]  That far red light spectrum triggers a hormone and a protein in the plant known as phytochrome
[11:53.280 --> 11:54.920]  red.
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.280]  That hormone tells the plant it is nighttime.
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.680]  So even though there is still light in the sky, that plant is being told it is sleepy
[12:03.680 --> 12:08.420]  time so it shuts down and starts doing its nighttime productivity.
[12:08.420 --> 12:12.560]  So that hormone in that plant triggers a protein in that plant and that is triggered
[12:12.560 --> 12:16.020]  by a certain spectrum that comes from the sun.
[12:16.020 --> 12:21.700]  So this listener is asking if they can set up different Kelvin rating lights to attempt
[12:21.700 --> 12:29.300]  to simulate the rising, the midday, and the sunset spectrums of the natural sun.
[12:29.300 --> 12:33.260]  This is a very good idea and this would work very well in theory.
[12:33.260 --> 12:39.180]  The thing we need to focus more carefully on is specific spectrums of lighting.
[12:39.180 --> 12:45.280]  To put the plants to sleep, I do believe we need a specific UV spectrum of lighting that
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.320]  does not come from our standard fluorescents or our HID lights.
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.460]  The only people I know putting out a light with that spectrum at this time are Spectrum
[12:54.460 --> 12:55.460]  King.
[12:55.460 --> 12:56.500]  I may be wrong.
[12:56.500 --> 12:59.580]  Our friends from Canon may have produced a light with the same spectrum.
[12:59.580 --> 13:03.700]  There may be other brands out there putting out the light with the far-red feature, but
[13:03.700 --> 13:08.380]  to the best of my knowledge, at this time, Spectrum King is the only brand offering that
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.380]  light.
[13:09.380 --> 13:11.580]  Again, I'm saying I may be wrong.
[13:11.580 --> 13:15.780]  And by the time this episode comes out or by the time you listen to this episode, there
[13:15.780 --> 13:19.800]  could be 5, 10, or 20 new brands that have been launched.
[13:19.800 --> 13:21.980]  So your idea would work in theory.
[13:21.980 --> 13:24.980]  However, we need to dial in the specific spectrums.
[13:24.980 --> 13:32.100]  I don't think that your basic red T5 light or T8 light or any type of HID light is going
[13:32.100 --> 13:34.300]  to produce that red spectrum.
[13:34.300 --> 13:38.760]  So unless you dial in the perfect spectrum for that far-red lighting to trigger that
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.220]  phytochrome red response, I think that would probably be possibly more stressful to the
[13:44.220 --> 13:47.780]  plant than it would be beneficial to change that light spectrum throughout the day like
[13:47.780 --> 13:48.780]  that.
[13:48.780 --> 13:53.260]  A more common practice is to use a bluer bulb during the veg phase because we want the plants
[13:53.340 --> 13:54.900]  to stay short and stocky.
[13:54.900 --> 13:59.100]  And then toward the flowering phase, we usually tend to move toward the redder bulbs because
[13:59.100 --> 14:01.260]  that encourages fatter bud growth.
[14:01.260 --> 14:04.740]  In a lot of cases now, we are seeing mixed spectrums.
[14:04.740 --> 14:09.780]  We're seeing high-pressure sodium bulbs in flower rooms with a few metal halide bulbs
[14:09.780 --> 14:12.180]  in flower rooms just to add to the spectrum.
[14:12.180 --> 14:15.780]  And then I'm also seeing people put ceramic metal halides in rooms.
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.540]  I'm also seeing LEDs.
[14:17.540 --> 14:21.100]  And then I'm seeing mixtures and combinations of all of the above.
[14:21.100 --> 14:24.900]  Sometimes I feel like these combos don't work because of the patterns in which the
[14:24.900 --> 14:26.580]  lights are laid.
[14:26.580 --> 14:28.740]  Sometimes I feel like it's a bit overkill.
[14:28.740 --> 14:33.460]  But sometimes I do see really great results from rooms that are thought out with mixed
[14:33.460 --> 14:34.800]  spectrums.
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.580]  So your idea is great in theory, but if you are not dialing in the exact red light spectrum,
[14:40.580 --> 14:45.940]  it is not worth the energy because it is not going to trigger the phytochrome red response
[14:45.940 --> 14:47.340]  you were looking for.
[14:47.340 --> 14:48.740]  Now let's keep moving.
[14:48.740 --> 14:51.300]  There is more to this email.
[14:51.300 --> 14:52.300]  It goes on to say,
[14:52.300 --> 14:56.980]  Now lastly, and I'm sorry, I know this is getting long-winded, but because of my issues
[14:56.980 --> 15:02.700]  with getting bad info in my area, my plants were getting sick and I was almost ready to
[15:02.700 --> 15:03.700]  quit.
[15:03.700 --> 15:08.300]  Then, I was on the road with my band and I tried to purchase some legal cannabis from
[15:08.300 --> 15:09.300]  a company.
[15:09.300 --> 15:11.820]  He names the company here, but I'm going to leave their name out.
[15:11.820 --> 15:16.620]  I tried to purchase legal cannabis from a company and it was fucking atrocious.
[15:16.620 --> 15:17.620]  And then he also says,
[15:17.620 --> 15:21.780]  It happened to be one of my favorite strains, which was sour tangy.
[15:21.780 --> 15:25.180]  So that sucks when you go to the store and you try to buy your favorite strain and it
[15:25.180 --> 15:27.940]  is atrocious is the word this person used.
[15:27.940 --> 15:28.940]  So they continue, it says,
[15:28.940 --> 15:33.300]  All day I was thinking how I can get involved and fix this.
[15:33.300 --> 15:37.540]  Then suddenly an opportunity to work at a grow store presented itself.
[15:37.540 --> 15:40.660]  Isn't it great how life just seems to open doors for you like that?
[15:40.660 --> 15:41.660]  The message keeps going.
[15:41.660 --> 15:42.660]  It says,
[15:42.660 --> 15:46.220]  I've heard you say that you get out of this plant what you put into it.
[15:46.220 --> 15:49.100]  And I know that that is absolutely true.
[15:49.100 --> 15:54.420]  So my question to you is, what would you like to see in a grow store or even a grow store
[15:54.420 --> 15:59.220]  employee and what kind of practices do you think should be promoted?
[15:59.220 --> 16:02.140]  I'm not looking for product recommendations or anything.
[16:02.140 --> 16:07.300]  I'm just wondering if you were to go into a grow store, what would really impress you?
[16:07.300 --> 16:08.460]  That is a great question.
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.340]  He wraps it up by saying,
[16:10.340 --> 16:14.820]  Being Canadian, I will apologize again for the fucking novel of an email here.
[16:14.820 --> 16:16.180]  Hey, it's a great email.
[16:16.180 --> 16:17.180]  Don't apologize.
[16:17.180 --> 16:19.180]  I love all the information I'm able to share.
[16:19.180 --> 16:20.460]  And that comes from good questions.
[16:20.460 --> 16:22.020]  So it also says,
[16:22.020 --> 16:25.260]  Hearing you talk on your show and then finding out you're also a drummer.
[16:25.260 --> 16:28.420]  I just had to get these couple of things out.
[16:28.420 --> 16:32.620]  Mostly just a big thank you, but also to see your thoughts on these things.
[16:32.620 --> 16:34.900]  Then they say thanks again for everything.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.940]  And they signed their name.
[16:35.940 --> 16:37.920]  I don't know if they want their name set on the show.
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.600]  So big thank you to my new Canadian drummer friend who has a new job at a grow store who
[16:43.600 --> 16:49.680]  wants to know what do I find valuable in a grow store or a grow store employee?
[16:49.680 --> 16:51.560]  That's a very good question.
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.000]  Oftentimes when I go to the grow store, I run into the same exact problems I run into
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.320]  when I go to the music store.
[16:58.320 --> 17:04.760]  I am a very experienced and confident grower and I'm a very experienced and confident drummer.
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.240]  When I go to the store to update or replace my gear, I know what I want.
[17:09.240 --> 17:10.600]  I've done some shopping.
[17:10.600 --> 17:11.960]  I've gone on the internet.
[17:11.960 --> 17:13.240]  I have used equipment.
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.360]  I've shopped around.
[17:14.360 --> 17:15.360]  I know what I want.
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.360]  When I walk in there and I say, Hey, I would like to buy product F6355.
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.800]  And the person at the counter looks at you with an attitude and goes, Oh, you like F6355?
[17:24.800 --> 17:26.020]  That brand sucks.
[17:26.020 --> 17:27.600]  I like this brand.
[17:27.600 --> 17:29.560]  And depending on where you are, you get a different attitude.
[17:29.560 --> 17:32.960]  At the grow store, they go, bro, I use this and my grow comes out way better.
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.040]  And if you're a guitar center, they fucking twirl their hair and they go, bro, I play
[17:36.040 --> 17:38.680]  these and they sound way better.
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.880]  Don't be that guy.
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.400]  If somebody goes in there and they know what they want, confidently get it off of the shelf
[17:44.400 --> 17:47.120]  and sell them extra shit to go with it.
[17:47.120 --> 17:49.640]  Don't tell them their product sucks ever.
[17:49.640 --> 17:54.080]  If somebody walks in and wants to buy something and they've got cash, you take their fucking
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.360]  cash and give them the product they asked for.
[17:57.360 --> 17:59.120]  Don't ever belittle your customers.
[17:59.120 --> 18:01.720]  Your customers are paying your rent.
[18:01.720 --> 18:02.720]  Appreciate them.
[18:03.480 --> 18:06.480]  If somebody's buying a product you do not approve of, if you think you can help somebody
[18:06.480 --> 18:11.680]  increase the potential of their grow, let them purchase the product that they choose
[18:11.680 --> 18:12.680]  to buy.
[18:12.680 --> 18:17.440]  Then the next time you see them say, Hey, I saw you were buying Fox Farms and we all
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.440]  know Fox Farms is like entry level gross stuff.
[18:20.440 --> 18:24.800]  Say there's this new company and they offer this and we're going to have a sale on this
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.400]  product next month.
[18:26.400 --> 18:28.260]  I thought you may be interested.
[18:28.260 --> 18:31.400]  Tell them why it would be a step up from whatever they're using.
[18:31.400 --> 18:32.560]  Don't belittle their shit.
[18:32.560 --> 18:34.760]  Let them buy what they want to buy.
[18:34.760 --> 18:37.840]  Then next time suggest the step up.
[18:37.840 --> 18:38.840]  Don't belittle.
[18:38.840 --> 18:40.240]  Encourage growth.
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.240]  So that's probably the first most important piece of advice that comes to my mind.
[18:44.240 --> 18:48.040]  Don't belittle me because of the products I want to buy and don't tell me how your product
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.960]  is better and don't just try to put yourself on me while I'm shopping.
[18:51.960 --> 18:53.320]  I'm not there for you.
[18:53.320 --> 18:56.260]  I'm there for me to buy shit for my grow.
[18:56.260 --> 18:58.320]  So make me feel like I'm the important one there.
[18:58.320 --> 19:00.960]  Make your customer feel like the important one there.
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.920]  Then get a very good cultivation knowledge and have a good glossary of terms.
[19:06.920 --> 19:08.860]  Understand the proper words to use.
[19:08.860 --> 19:10.400]  Understand the parts of the plant.
[19:10.400 --> 19:12.000]  Understand the nutrients.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.220]  Understand the equipment.
[19:13.220 --> 19:14.760]  Understand what you're selling.
[19:14.760 --> 19:17.960]  Don't try to sell people shit just to make commission.
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.160]  Sell them what you think they will need and they will come back and buy more shit from
[19:22.160 --> 19:24.320]  you and you will still make your commission.
[19:24.320 --> 19:26.880]  Don't force feed anybody any products.
[19:26.880 --> 19:29.880]  Now a lot of what I'm telling you I have learned in basic sales schools.
[19:29.880 --> 19:35.920]  A lot of time learn your products and always have a good, better and best recommendation.
[19:35.920 --> 19:39.280]  If I walk in and I say, Hey, I need something to do this.
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.240]  Say, Oh, here's the section where we keep that.
[19:42.240 --> 19:43.680]  Here's one that you can get.
[19:43.680 --> 19:45.040]  Here's the middle priced one.
[19:45.040 --> 19:46.360]  This one's the best.
[19:46.360 --> 19:47.360]  Then back up.
[19:47.360 --> 19:48.560]  Let me make my decision.
[19:48.560 --> 19:50.240]  Don't force feed me a product.
[19:50.240 --> 19:53.840]  If you see that I'm going for the one in the middle and I may need something to go with
[19:53.840 --> 19:57.640]  that, be a good sales guy, have my back and go, Oh, if you're going to get that, you
[19:57.640 --> 19:59.860]  may also want this to go with it.
[19:59.860 --> 20:03.420]  Then when I get to the register, that's when you've got the opportunity to upsell me.
[20:03.420 --> 20:05.300]  Do I have personal protective equipment?
[20:05.300 --> 20:06.300]  Do I have gloves?
[20:06.300 --> 20:07.300]  Do I have goggles?
[20:07.300 --> 20:08.380]  Do I have a face mask?
[20:08.380 --> 20:13.580]  There's always shit to upsell, but make sure you get what I need before you upsell me on
[20:13.580 --> 20:14.580]  some shit.
[20:14.580 --> 20:17.860]  Don't just try to get money out of my pocket without sending me out of there happy.
[20:17.860 --> 20:21.740]  If you send me out of the grocery store with a smile, I'll spend all my money, but if you
[20:21.740 --> 20:25.860]  bother me and you upset my shopping experience, I won't give you any of my money.
[20:25.860 --> 20:27.860]  I'll go somewhere where they do it correctly.
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.900]  So that is probably some of the best advice I can give you.
[20:30.900 --> 20:33.300]  That is just basic sales school stuff.
[20:33.300 --> 20:34.820]  Be friendly, be knowledgeable.
[20:34.820 --> 20:35.940]  Don't be a dickhead.
[20:35.940 --> 20:37.660]  Don't be in there to steal money from people.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.660]  Don't be in there to get rich.
[20:38.660 --> 20:40.460]  Be there to help people out.
[20:40.460 --> 20:43.300]  Don't pitch products because a company told you to pitch a product.
[20:43.300 --> 20:47.180]  Pitch a product because you believe in it, but if somebody doesn't want that, have another
[20:47.180 --> 20:49.420]  solution, another option for them.
[20:49.420 --> 20:51.580]  And here's another great piece of advice.
[20:51.580 --> 20:54.660]  Don't ever be afraid to say, I don't know.
[20:54.660 --> 20:57.620]  If somebody comes in and they're trying to tell you they've got a problem or ask you
[20:57.660 --> 21:02.940]  for some sort of advice and you don't have a solution, just say, wow, I don't know.
[21:02.940 --> 21:06.660]  Because if you tell me that I have got this problem and I buy a bunch of shit and try
[21:06.660 --> 21:11.540]  to go solve that problem with your solution and all it does is backtrack me, guess who
[21:11.540 --> 21:13.180]  I'm never trusting again?
[21:13.180 --> 21:15.100]  Guess where I'm never going to shop again?
[21:15.100 --> 21:16.100]  That's you, buddy.
[21:16.100 --> 21:20.040]  So give solid advice, but don't be afraid to say, I don't know.
[21:20.040 --> 21:26.340]  Other than that, bro, follow basic sales class techniques, approach, position, engage, follow
[21:26.340 --> 21:27.340]  through.
[21:27.340 --> 21:28.340]  That's all you got to do, man.
[21:28.340 --> 21:30.980]  Make the sale happen and it will sell itself.
[21:30.980 --> 21:35.140]  Be friendly, be a good person, and the customers will keep coming on back.
[21:35.140 --> 21:37.340]  So I want to thank you again for the great email.
[21:37.340 --> 21:39.260]  You're a drummer and you said you were on tour.
[21:39.260 --> 21:42.840]  So that means that you've probably got some music you could send to me and I can play
[21:42.840 --> 21:45.440]  that on the show and we can get you some exposure.
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.980]  So I look forward to getting an MP3 from you in the very near future.
[21:48.980 --> 21:53.140]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, smokers and growers,

[23:08.900 --> 23:11.660]  I hope everybody out there is staying warm, staying safe.
[23:11.660 --> 23:14.860]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy JR Token.
[23:14.860 --> 23:18.380]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[23:23.460 --> 23:35.570]  The Army's on ecstasy, so they say.
[23:35.570 --> 23:39.570]  I read all about it in USA Today.
[23:39.570 --> 23:42.570]  They stepped up urine testing, tough to make it go away.
[23:42.570 --> 23:45.570]  It's hard to kill the enemy on OMDMA.
[23:45.570 --> 23:49.570]  I said the king of contradiction to the queen of mystery.
[23:49.570 --> 23:52.570]  The prince of paradox, he dogs me like a flea.
[23:52.570 --> 23:56.570]  So I'll set my troops upon him and bring him to his knees.
[23:56.570 --> 23:59.570]  When all is said and done, I'll pick a fight with the Chinese.
[23:59.570 --> 24:02.570]  The queen, she stared him long and hard and then she softly said,
[24:02.570 --> 24:05.570]  I'll fuck you down with linseed oil to ease your throbbing.
[24:05.570 --> 24:09.570]  She slipped a note into an apricot and threw it to the horse.
[24:09.570 --> 24:13.570]  The jester read the words, something wicked this way roars.
[24:13.570 --> 24:16.570]  The Army's on ecstasy, so they say.
[24:16.570 --> 24:19.570]  I read all about it in USA Today.
[24:19.570 --> 24:22.570]  They stepped up urine testing, tough to make it go away.
[24:22.570 --> 24:26.570]  It's hard to kill the enemy on OMDMA.
[24:58.640 --> 25:01.640]  The prize they put upon the heads of folks with pointed views
[25:01.640 --> 25:04.640]  would be better spent on the children without shoes.
[25:04.640 --> 25:07.640]  And when the king condoned the actions of the liar,
[25:07.640 --> 25:11.640]  he forgot to weigh the awesome power of the village crier.
[25:11.640 --> 25:14.640]  The Army's on ecstasy, so they say.
[25:14.640 --> 25:17.640]  I read all about it in USA Today.
[25:17.640 --> 25:20.640]  They stepped up urine testing, tough to make it go away.
[25:20.640 --> 25:23.640]  It's hard to kill the enemy on OMDMA.
[25:41.640 --> 25:56.640]  The Army's on ecstasy, so they say.
[25:56.640 --> 26:08.640]  I read all about it in USA Today.
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.640]  They stepped up urine testing, tough to make it go away.
[26:12.640 --> 26:18.640]  It's hard to kill the enemy on OMDMA.
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.640]  The Army's on ecstasy, so they say.
[26:22.640 --> 26:25.640]  I read all about it in USA Today.
[26:25.640 --> 26:28.640]  They stepped up urine testing, tough to make it go away.
[26:28.640 --> 26:31.640]  It's hard to kill the enemy on OMDMA.
[26:31.640 --> 26:34.160]  The absurdest anarchist decree
[26:34.460 --> 27:05.700]  You understand no one to understand
[27:05.880 --> 27:07.360]  It's design you will need to know
[27:07.500 --> 27:18.160]  Oh, diacon
