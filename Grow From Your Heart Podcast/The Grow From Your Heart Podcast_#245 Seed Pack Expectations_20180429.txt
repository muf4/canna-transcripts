[00:15.550 --> 00:18.190]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:18.190 --> 00:21.510]  It's time for episode number two 45 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:21.750 --> 00:25.850]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:25.850 --> 00:27.750]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.790 --> 00:29.790]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.230 --> 00:33.230]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:33.230 --> 00:36.870]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.070 --> 00:39.830]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.830 --> 00:42.230]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:42.270 --> 00:45.230]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:45.230 --> 00:48.430]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:48.710 --> 00:51.110]  Koot and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:53.030 --> 00:53.750]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:53.750 --> 00:57.590]  you will not hear me bitching about the heat in Colorado for quite some time.
[00:58.510 --> 01:01.030]  That's right. It's starting to cool off this morning. It was nice and chilly.
[01:01.030 --> 01:04.590]  And this evening it's getting a little bit cold. I had to close the windows.
[01:04.950 --> 01:09.030]  I've had the swamp cooler and air conditioner running every day until yesterday
[01:09.030 --> 01:11.710]  or the day before it is starting to cool off here in Colorado.
[01:12.270 --> 01:13.750]  I think I'm looking forward to the cool.
[01:14.270 --> 01:16.950]  You don't have to run as much air conditioning. You can run a few more lights.
[01:17.230 --> 01:20.790]  Things get a little bit easier. Some things get a little bit easier in the cool.
[01:20.870 --> 01:23.430]  Driving sucks in the snow. That's the least favorite part.
[01:23.430 --> 01:25.390]  Getting to and from work in the snow is kind of a bitch,
[01:25.710 --> 01:29.110]  but I'm looking forward to the fall winter season this year.
[01:29.110 --> 01:32.590]  You won't hear me complain about the sun and the heat at all for a few months,
[01:32.590 --> 01:36.150]  which you will hear me complain about. Somebody keeps smoking on my damn hash.
[01:36.510 --> 01:39.310]  I keep buying this hash. I got this SoCal OG.
[01:39.990 --> 01:41.430]  I might've talked about it on the last episode.
[01:41.430 --> 01:43.110]  I got the SoCal OG at Apothecary.
[01:43.670 --> 01:45.710]  That's so good that it just keeps disappearing. I don't know.
[01:46.110 --> 01:47.830]  It's like I take a dab of it and I blow it out and I'm like,
[01:47.830 --> 01:51.910]  that was fucking delicious. I want another dab. It's just so tasty.
[01:51.990 --> 01:54.550]  I can't get enough of that. Someone keeps smoking on my hash.
[01:54.550 --> 01:58.710]  I'm pretty sure it's me. You guys, I'm pretty sure it's me. Hey,
[01:58.710 --> 02:01.790]  if you guys know who's smoking on my hash, let me know. Make them fucking quit.
[02:03.190 --> 02:04.550]  All right, let's get serious. Ladies and gentlemen,

[02:37.070 --> 02:38.630]  let's talk about what I did over the weekend.
[02:38.630 --> 02:41.870]  I'm going to brag for a couple of seconds before we get into the podcast on
[02:41.870 --> 02:44.510]  Sunday. I took my beautiful daughter, Maya. That's right.
[02:44.510 --> 02:47.110]  I've got a 14 year old daughter. She's a beautiful little girl.
[02:47.350 --> 02:49.990]  It'll talk about her a lot on the podcast because it's kind of none of your damn
[02:49.990 --> 02:50.390]  business.
[02:50.390 --> 02:52.630]  But I took my beautiful daughter and my beautiful girlfriend,
[02:52.630 --> 02:55.190]  Jenny Beth to the Denver zoo on Sunday.
[02:55.190 --> 02:56.950]  And we got to go check out some animals at the zoo.
[02:56.950 --> 03:00.110]  We got to see the silverback gorilla. We got to see some lions.
[03:00.110 --> 03:03.830]  We got to see some tigers. We saw some bears. Oh my, it was a great experience.
[03:03.830 --> 03:06.550]  I think we all had a good time. We all had a bunch of fun.
[03:06.550 --> 03:08.950]  We are some twisted individuals.
[03:08.950 --> 03:12.710]  I think we had more fun making fun of the silly humans than we actually had
[03:12.910 --> 03:16.670]  checking out the animals at the zoo, but that's just the type of folks we are.
[03:16.670 --> 03:17.630]  It was a good ass time.
[03:17.950 --> 03:19.950]  Shout out to Jenny Beth for hanging out with my daughter.
[03:19.950 --> 03:22.590]  And I also shout out to Maya Luna for hanging out with my girlfriend and I,
[03:23.150 --> 03:25.830]  I don't think Maya will listen to this podcast, but I love you kiddo.
[03:25.870 --> 03:29.230]  I hope you listen someday. The zoo was a good time. You guys,
[03:29.230 --> 03:32.150]  we saw a whole bunch of great stuff, a whole bunch of great animals,
[03:32.150 --> 03:35.870]  a whole bunch of great birds and reptiles and fishes and other stuff of that
[03:35.870 --> 03:38.990]  nature. One thing at the Denver zoo that kind of tripped me out,
[03:39.470 --> 03:41.710]  they are doing zoo dinosaurs.
[03:42.350 --> 03:45.070]  So occasionally you'll be walking through the zoo and you'll hear a roar,
[03:45.790 --> 03:46.910]  a roar that confuses you.
[03:46.910 --> 03:49.310]  If you don't know there are dinosaurs at the zoo this week, because I was like,
[03:49.310 --> 03:52.550]  what the fuck animal is that? Cause it was intense. It was loud.
[03:52.550 --> 03:54.910]  It was really bassy and I could hear it from a long ways away.
[03:55.030 --> 03:58.870]  It was not a real animal. It was a dinosaur. Now people are going,
[03:58.910 --> 04:00.950]  they had dinosaurs. What the fuck? That's what I said too.
[04:00.990 --> 04:03.030]  They're not real dinosaurs. You guys, they're animatronic.
[04:03.030 --> 04:05.510]  They will not hurt you. They are peaceful. They are robots.
[04:05.510 --> 04:08.270]  They are digital. Uh, but man, how,
[04:08.950 --> 04:10.550]  is that going to confuse some little kids?
[04:10.710 --> 04:13.710]  Cause we're teaching little kids that the dinosaurs were years ago and then
[04:13.710 --> 04:15.310]  they're going to go to the zoo and they're going to see dinosaurs and be like,
[04:15.310 --> 04:16.710]  what the fuck? All the books are lying.
[04:16.950 --> 04:19.950]  I got damn seen dinosaurs at the zoo last week. It's going to be weird.
[04:19.990 --> 04:22.270]  Someone's going to go to school. Some little kids are going to go to school.
[04:22.270 --> 04:23.350]  They're going to start school and they're gonna be like,
[04:23.350 --> 04:25.750]  I saw a dinosaur and they're choosing like, no, you didn't. I'm like, fuck you.
[04:25.750 --> 04:29.150]  Yes I did. It's going to be weird. There's dinosaurs at the Denver zoo.
[04:29.150 --> 04:31.670]  You guys, I thought it was weird. Is that confusing to kids?
[04:31.670 --> 04:34.470]  I really don't know. Really don't know. All right.
[04:34.630 --> 04:36.670]  So after the, uh, the zoo,
[04:36.830 --> 04:39.990]  I took my beautiful daughter home and the lovely, always lovely,
[04:39.990 --> 04:41.590]  always beautiful Jenny Beth and I,
[04:41.830 --> 04:46.190]  we got to go to Cervantes other side and to see what I think is my favorite
[04:46.190 --> 04:46.710]  reggae band.
[04:46.710 --> 04:49.590]  I've called them my favorite reggae band enough times that I think I believe it.
[04:49.790 --> 04:53.230]  I got to go see Morgan heritage at Cervantes other side in Denver.
[04:53.670 --> 04:56.550]  I was a pretty good show. We showed up fairly early.
[04:56.550 --> 05:00.630]  We got to see the opening act. They were called red sage. They were good,
[05:00.670 --> 05:04.150]  but I don't know that they were the appropriate opening act for Morgan
[05:04.190 --> 05:07.510]  heritage. They were a little more like fortunate youth,
[05:07.510 --> 05:09.350]  more on the sublime side of things.
[05:09.710 --> 05:11.830]  I kind of would have fit in with the mystic roots band.
[05:11.870 --> 05:16.350]  Not quite the roots rock reggae sort of thing that you should have had opening
[05:16.350 --> 05:19.750]  for Morgan heritage, in my opinion, but Hey, they brought a different crowd.
[05:19.750 --> 05:21.310]  More people came. That was cool.
[05:22.190 --> 05:26.150]  So Morgan heritage came on stage and Jenny Beth and I walked directly to the
[05:26.150 --> 05:29.030]  front of the stage. The stage is about waist high.
[05:29.390 --> 05:33.470]  Jenny Beth was directly in front of the stage right behind her was me protecting
[05:33.510 --> 05:35.190]  her from all the other idiots up front.
[05:35.870 --> 05:38.350]  There's something weird that happens late at night when people are up front at a
[05:38.350 --> 05:39.350]  concert. Uh,
[05:39.350 --> 05:41.910]  you just see everybody get this glazed look on their face once the drugs and
[05:41.930 --> 05:44.430]  alcohol start kicking in and they just go full retard.
[05:44.450 --> 05:46.790]  They think they can ram into you and bump into you and push you over.
[05:47.110 --> 05:50.430]  And it's ridiculous. And being six, five and having dreadlocks to my ass,
[05:50.710 --> 05:55.110]  I can make it clear to the drunk people that the space I am standing in and the
[05:55.110 --> 05:59.070]  space I am protecting for my girlfriend, that is my space. And I will not move.
[05:59.190 --> 06:00.310]  We're going to hold our ground.
[06:00.590 --> 06:03.590]  So you have to spend a little bit of your time kind of claiming your space and
[06:03.590 --> 06:06.070]  putting your elbows up occasionally because people get a little bit ridiculous,
[06:06.070 --> 06:09.030]  but we had a great time. I protected the miss, the always beautiful,
[06:09.030 --> 06:12.070]  always lovely miss Jenny Beth protected her pretty well from the drunken idiots.
[06:12.070 --> 06:15.070]  She didn't get plowed into too much. We got to see the band up front.
[06:15.710 --> 06:17.190]  It was such a great show. Uh,
[06:17.210 --> 06:21.670]  we were so close that I could hear Peter Morgan's voice coming out of him before
[06:21.670 --> 06:24.470]  it hit the microphone and before it went into the sound system.
[06:24.870 --> 06:28.070]  And that man has an amazing fucking voice.
[06:28.310 --> 06:32.470]  Peter Morgan from Morgan heritage is one of my favorite vocalists ever.
[06:32.710 --> 06:36.430]  The dude's got mad style. The dude's got mad flow. His voice is awesome.
[06:36.590 --> 06:40.150]  He's got a good vibe. I just liked the way that dude performs. Uh,
[06:40.170 --> 06:43.750]  his brother Gramps Morgan off to the right side of him. Uh, my right of him,
[06:43.750 --> 06:46.190]  it'd be his left. I guess Mr. Gramps Morgan.
[06:46.670 --> 06:49.430]  I could hear him saying that dude's got a deep rich voice.
[06:49.590 --> 06:52.870]  He's got a big infectious smile. He just looks like a big Jamaican teddy bear.
[06:53.270 --> 06:55.310]  I just looks like such a cool dude. Uh,
[06:55.390 --> 06:58.750]  then Mojo Morgan on the other side of the stage plays percussion. Uh,
[06:59.030 --> 07:02.030]  he raps a few times. That dude's just always got the biggest,
[07:02.070 --> 07:04.870]  cheesiest smile on his face. He doesn't sing a whole lot.
[07:04.910 --> 07:07.270]  He's more kind of a kind of a rapper sort of a dude.
[07:07.270 --> 07:09.270]  He does his own little raps and parts of the songs,
[07:09.590 --> 07:12.910]  but I could hear these guys as voices before they were hitting the microphones
[07:13.030 --> 07:15.870]  and their harmonies together, their voices individually.
[07:16.110 --> 07:17.750]  These guys have some fucking talent. You guys,
[07:17.750 --> 07:22.750]  they got the richest voices that I've heard in a long time at a great time.
[07:23.150 --> 07:26.630]  So Sunday we see Morgan heritage. We drive back to Pueblo Monday.
[07:26.630 --> 07:30.510]  I go to work kind of dragging ass because a Sunday was a long fucking night.
[07:30.510 --> 07:33.030]  We didn't get home till super late. We didn't get to bed till even later.
[07:33.310 --> 07:36.150]  I had to get up, had to go to the grow. I did that.
[07:36.510 --> 07:38.350]  Might've been a little silly, might've been a little bit loopy,
[07:38.350 --> 07:41.310]  but I made the best of it. Got some rest. Then on Tuesday,
[07:41.350 --> 07:43.910]  I went to work again after work,
[07:44.590 --> 07:47.150]  came to the house and got cleaned up a little bit and met up with the always
[07:47.150 --> 07:48.910]  lovely, always beautiful miss Jenny Beth.
[07:48.910 --> 07:52.750]  And her and I headed up to Colorado Springs to the black sheep to see Morgan
[07:52.750 --> 07:57.390]  heritage. Once again, it was a great show on Sunday. Um,
[07:57.750 --> 08:00.150]  the opening act once again was a great opening act.
[08:00.270 --> 08:04.710]  I cannot remember their name right now. Project two, three, four, project,
[08:04.710 --> 08:08.310]  three, two, four project, four, two, three project. And the numbers,
[08:08.310 --> 08:10.470]  it had two, three and four, but they were not in the correct order.
[08:10.670 --> 08:13.550]  Project three, two, four is what I want to call them. Not certain,
[08:13.550 --> 08:16.830]  but project something. They were a good band. I really liked their style.
[08:17.070 --> 08:19.190]  Their drummer played some really great fills.
[08:19.550 --> 08:21.630]  Other guitar player was fucking talented.
[08:21.790 --> 08:24.990]  Their bass player held it down and the other guitar player, the rhythm guy,
[08:25.270 --> 08:25.710]  there were,
[08:25.710 --> 08:30.550]  he's played some really nice rhythms with like really nice lead parts mixed into
[08:30.550 --> 08:34.510]  the rhythms is really cool. That band was really cool. Maybe once again,
[08:34.510 --> 08:38.310]  not the appropriate opener for Morgan heritage, but music is music, man.
[08:38.310 --> 08:40.430]  If you've got an opening act to start the party, let's do it.
[08:40.470 --> 08:42.070]  I think they were great. Uh,
[08:42.070 --> 08:45.590]  Morgan heritage came on stage and I headed directly to the front of the venue.
[08:45.590 --> 08:48.990]  Jenny Beth and I were directly in front of PETA Morgan. Once again, all night,
[08:49.030 --> 08:51.470]  it was a great show. You know, in the first night,
[08:51.470 --> 08:54.470]  there were about 80 to a hundred people in the venue, I would estimate.
[08:54.790 --> 08:58.230]  And on the Sunday show or on the Tuesday show at the black sheep,
[08:58.430 --> 09:00.910]  there were maybe 25 or 30 people at the show.
[09:01.310 --> 09:03.110]  And the band still gave it their all.
[09:03.110 --> 09:06.630]  They still performed like they were at reggae sun splash.
[09:06.710 --> 09:08.590]  They performed like they were at reggae on the river.
[09:08.750 --> 09:12.110]  They gave their full big show just like they normally would. Uh,
[09:12.150 --> 09:15.950]  they played mostly the same set on both nights with a couple of variations.
[09:15.990 --> 09:17.430]  They switched out a couple of songs.
[09:18.150 --> 09:22.710]  I was really happy to hear a Moscow square on Tuesday. That's just a good song.
[09:22.710 --> 09:24.910]  It's from one of their older albums, which I really love.
[09:25.190 --> 09:27.630]  They did not play what we need as love on the second show,
[09:27.630 --> 09:30.470]  but they did on the first show, which came from, from the, uh,
[09:30.710 --> 09:33.190]  my favorite album of theirs called more teachings. Uh,
[09:33.470 --> 09:36.950]  both those songs came from that one. They opened both nights with strictly roots.
[09:36.990 --> 09:40.870]  They closed both nights with reggae night. Uh, they do,
[09:41.190 --> 09:44.630]  she's still loving me. Uh, they do, they do Sela of course,
[09:44.630 --> 09:46.070]  and a bunch of great songs in the middle,
[09:46.350 --> 09:48.990]  but there weren't very many people there at the Tuesday show. Uh,
[09:48.990 --> 09:49.630]  it was a great show.
[09:49.630 --> 09:53.550]  We were up front once again and there was a moment when the reverb was so loud
[09:53.550 --> 09:55.350]  that I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[09:55.350 --> 09:59.830]  The singer would sing into the microphone and then it would take like this long
[09:59.910 --> 10:02.670]  fruit. So he would be like, here is my lyric.
[10:02.750 --> 10:04.670]  And then you would hear this much delay. And then it would go,
[10:04.670 --> 10:09.230]  here is my lyric. Here is my lyric. Here is my lyric. So he couldn't even,
[10:09.510 --> 10:12.190]  I could tell he was becoming frustrated by all the reverb. He couldn't hear
[10:12.190 --> 10:14.190]  himself. I couldn't hear him. Uh,
[10:14.230 --> 10:19.190]  but we were so close that I was hearing where I was hearing the stage sound in
[10:19.310 --> 10:21.870]  front of me. And then the house sound behind me and all the sound was mixing.
[10:21.870 --> 10:22.710]  It was really odd.
[10:22.790 --> 10:26.830]  I would have been better to back up about 10 feet just because of the sound of
[10:26.830 --> 10:29.870]  that venue. But I was so close that I could hear, feel,
[10:29.870 --> 10:32.070]  and see the drums coming off of the drums.
[10:32.350 --> 10:35.390]  Here the sound coming off the drums before they went through the speakers.
[10:35.630 --> 10:38.190]  And I was loving that because I was hearing the tone of those drums and just
[10:38.190 --> 10:41.590]  watching that drummer. I do not know the drummer for Morgan heritage,
[10:41.590 --> 10:43.670]  his name, but that dude is bad ass.
[10:44.110 --> 10:47.910]  I'm pretty sure the bass player for Morgan heritage is a toots,
[10:47.910 --> 10:51.190]  Hibbert's son or grandson. He's young. So I'm going to say grandson,
[10:51.190 --> 10:54.350]  these kids, the basin drummer looks like 19 and 20 years old.
[10:54.350 --> 10:56.790]  Those guys are barely 21. If they're 21,
[10:56.790 --> 11:00.630]  there's some young cats and that rhythm section fucking held it down and tore it
[11:00.670 --> 11:04.510]  up. Those guys were great. Morgan heritage has a new backup singer.
[11:04.750 --> 11:09.630]  They have a lady in the band, a sister, uh, uh, Una Morgan, who I don't know why,
[11:09.630 --> 11:13.030]  but she has left the band. I would assume that it's a health reason.
[11:13.230 --> 11:14.430]  I cannot be positive.
[11:14.430 --> 11:16.790]  I'm assuming it's a health reason just from things I've observed,
[11:17.030 --> 11:20.390]  but Una hasn't been with the band for the past couple of tours that I've gone
[11:20.390 --> 11:21.870]  to. I see this band two or three times a year.
[11:22.270 --> 11:24.630]  She hasn't been on tour with them for at least the past two years.
[11:24.870 --> 11:27.950]  I don't know if Jenny Beth has ever seen them with Una, uh,
[11:27.950 --> 11:31.030]  which kind of gives me an indicator of how long she's been gone. Uh,
[11:31.030 --> 11:35.070]  but they have another backup singer named Natasha who seemed a little bit shy at
[11:35.070 --> 11:36.630]  first, but once she gets in the groove,
[11:36.870 --> 11:39.350]  that girl really gets in the groove and she's got a hell of a voice.
[11:39.350 --> 11:42.070]  So if you ever hear this, you're doing a great job. Don't be so shy.
[11:42.270 --> 11:44.950]  I like what you're doing. All right, you guys, I saw Morgan heritage.
[11:44.950 --> 11:47.710]  That's my point. I saw them twice and it was fucking amazing. Um,
[11:47.750 --> 11:50.150]  if you ever get to listen to Morgan heritage, I recommend it.
[11:50.190 --> 11:52.750]  Go for some of the older stuff, go for the more teachings album,
[11:53.070 --> 11:56.870]  then work your way on up. They have a plethora of varieties. They do.
[11:56.870 --> 12:00.030]  They do roots rock reggae. They do dance hall reggae. They do lovers reggae.
[12:00.030 --> 12:02.070]  They do some of that R and B kind of sound and reggae.
[12:02.350 --> 12:06.310]  They've got a lot of stuff to listen to. I really love Peter Morgan's voice.
[12:06.310 --> 12:08.910]  He's the high pitch singing one really love Gramps's voice.
[12:08.910 --> 12:11.870]  He's the low pitch singing one. And then they put the sister in there.
[12:11.910 --> 12:15.390]  They all mix up super well. Such a great vibe. All right, you guys,
[12:15.390 --> 12:17.150]  I'm going to quit talking about concerts that I get to go to.
[12:17.150 --> 12:20.710]  Cause I feel like I brag too much, but I love music. I love comedy.
[12:20.710 --> 12:24.230]  And I like sharing part of my world with you guys. So let me say that.
[12:24.390 --> 12:26.510]  Let me wrap this up by the saying this Tuesday night,
[12:26.750 --> 12:28.830]  I get to shake hands and hang out with Morgan heritage.
[12:28.870 --> 12:30.190]  I got my picture taken with all the guys.
[12:30.190 --> 12:32.190]  Thank you Jenny Beth for taking a great picture of us.
[12:32.670 --> 12:35.230]  Thank you to the black sheep for throwing a great show.
[12:35.270 --> 12:40.270]  And also big thanks to Morgan heritage for a great two nights of reggae music.
[12:40.470 --> 12:42.870]  Really needed it. Reggae music is like an attitude adjustment.
[12:42.870 --> 12:44.070]  It's like a mood shifter.
[12:44.630 --> 12:47.550]  Sometimes the guy that works too hard and gets frustrated with the world can use
[12:47.630 --> 12:51.750]  a little bit of an attitude adjustment. All right, let's move forward.
[12:51.750 --> 12:54.910]  You guys episode number 250 is coming. Holy crap.
[12:54.950 --> 12:57.950]  I'm five episodes away from episode number two 50.
[12:58.190 --> 12:59.830]  Honestly, when I started this podcast,
[13:00.070 --> 13:02.070]  I was like I'd like to get a hundred episodes under my belt.
[13:02.270 --> 13:04.110]  And then once I got like 50 episodes in, I was like, should,
[13:04.110 --> 13:07.590]  I'm going for at least 250 episodes. I'm almost at two 50 you guys.
[13:07.630 --> 13:11.110]  Let me tell you the truth. I have no intentions of ever stopping this podcast.
[13:11.630 --> 13:13.830]  I'm going to do this as long as I can. I love doing this.
[13:14.110 --> 13:17.590]  Sometimes it's a fucking struggle to get behind a microphone and spit out an hour
[13:17.710 --> 13:21.230]  or 30 minutes of material every week. I have to find the time to organize a show.
[13:21.230 --> 13:24.150]  I got to do it. I got to sit here and talk it. Uh, but you know what?
[13:24.150 --> 13:26.550]  I'm never going to stop doing it because I love doing it.
[13:26.550 --> 13:30.270]  I love sharing part of me with you guys. I love helping you with cannabis.
[13:30.510 --> 13:33.030]  I love getting cannabis freed up.
[13:33.030 --> 13:37.270]  I think we are, I think I am dispelling myths about cannabis.
[13:37.270 --> 13:40.150]  I'm breaking the truth to people. I'm taking the fear out of cannabis.
[13:40.350 --> 13:43.950]  I'm teaching people to take better care of their gardens and themselves by
[13:43.950 --> 13:46.910]  talking about cannabis. Maybe I'm helping people fight cancer.
[13:46.910 --> 13:49.950]  Maybe I'm helping people take care of a family member who is sick.
[13:50.150 --> 13:53.190]  I love doing this podcast because I know that every episode I put out,
[13:53.310 --> 13:57.110]  I hope at least one person. And if I'm just helping one person with every episode,
[13:57.310 --> 13:59.030]  it makes it well worth my time and energy.
[13:59.270 --> 14:03.590]  I feel like I would be doing the world and myself a disservice by not sharing all
[14:03.590 --> 14:05.470]  of the shit that I have learned with people.
[14:05.710 --> 14:09.950]  I've absorbed a lot and I've got a good brain and I like to talk a lot and I
[14:09.950 --> 14:13.230]  feel like it's kind of my responsibility to put this out here for you guys.
[14:13.470 --> 14:17.470]  I love you guys. I love cannabis. I love talking my ass off. I love podcasting.
[14:17.590 --> 14:18.790]  There's no reason for me to quit doing this.
[14:18.790 --> 14:22.470]  So I guess the new goal I'm going to say 500 episodes. That's kind of,
[14:23.070 --> 14:26.310]  that's 250 more. So let's say 500. And then when I hit that,
[14:26.310 --> 14:29.550]  we're going to aim for a thousand. Fuck seven 50. I don't even like that number.
[14:29.550 --> 14:31.830]  That's just like a give up number. You got to get to a thousand.
[14:32.510 --> 14:34.790]  Joe Rogan made it to a thousand. If Joe Rogan can do it,
[14:35.070 --> 14:37.830]  I can definitely do it. That dude puts out like three or four episodes a week,
[14:37.830 --> 14:40.830]  but he's at a thousand shout out to Joe Rogan. You guys,
[14:40.830 --> 14:42.070]  I feel like I'm super rambly.
[14:42.230 --> 14:44.750]  I am going to press pause on this recording for just a brief moment.
[14:44.790 --> 14:47.790]  I'm going to take a couple of gigantic dabs and then I'll be back.
[14:47.830 --> 14:50.870]  Hopefully I'll be a little calmer and then we'll work on some emails from some
[14:50.890 --> 14:54.710]  listeners. Ladies and gentlemen, join me for a dab and I will be right back.
[14:57.310 --> 14:58.150]  Oh yeah.
[14:58.150 --> 15:00.910]  Another song for my people. Yeah.
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.160]  All right. Podcast world. I am back. I am well hydrated and well medicated.
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.440]  I hope you enjoyed the reggae music. Hope you took a couple of dabs with me.
[15:36.720 --> 15:38.920]  Send me a tweet. Let me know what you dabbed.
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.520]  I dabbed some space bitch and it made me one spacey bitch. Send me a tweet.
[15:44.520 --> 15:48.480]  Let me know what you're smoking at GFYH podcast. I'd love to hear it. All right,
[15:48.500 --> 15:51.960]  let's get the show moving. Uh, I want to read an email on the last episode.
[15:51.960 --> 15:55.520]  I read an email about folks who wanted to move somebody who wanted to move from
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.640]  Georgia to Colorado and get into the industry.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.640]  And they sent me a little bit of an update.
[15:59.640 --> 16:00.680]  I'm not going to read the whole email,
[16:00.960 --> 16:03.360]  but I want to read some of the important parts. It says, Hey,
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.720]  I just listened to two 41.
[16:04.720 --> 16:07.840]  You mentioned reading some emails from Georgia and Florida listeners.
[16:08.120 --> 16:09.760]  Not sure if you were referring to my email,
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.800]  but I went back and read my email I sent and I wanted to clarify a few things.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.120]  I said I've been inspected and consulted. That sounded a bit pretentious.
[16:17.440 --> 16:20.840]  What I meant was I've passed out a lot of info forward.
[16:21.600 --> 16:24.280]  The people I've helped come from the old Southern school of thought that if it
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.200]  ain't broke, don't fix it. These individuals are good, simple living people,
[16:28.240 --> 16:31.840]  just trying to avoid the trap life hustle. I've helped with bug,
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.720]  helped with bug and deficiency problems such as corn worms, cow, mag deficiency,
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.840]  salt lock and mother plants, hot zones and flower rooms,
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.760]  different plant training techniques. And then he keeps going for a little while.
[16:42.080 --> 16:44.240]  Anyway, I wanted to read this guy's email. He says, uh,
[16:44.240 --> 16:48.520]  most of the info I have has come from you sub cool and my book collection, dude,
[16:48.520 --> 16:51.320]  if you're getting info from myself and sub cool and good books,
[16:51.320 --> 16:52.600]  you were off to a great start.
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.360]  He goes on to say I listened to 10 plus hours of podcasts and eBooks a day as I
[16:57.360 --> 16:59.720]  slave away at my structural structural,
[17:00.120 --> 17:03.720]  that's harder to say than it looks structural steel fabrication job.
[17:03.960 --> 17:06.880]  So I have a lot of info and just want to pass it forward.
[17:06.880 --> 17:09.280]  I don't want to get into the industry for the money,
[17:09.480 --> 17:11.720]  but for a better future for my family. And most importantly,
[17:11.720 --> 17:16.280]  I feel the need to be part of the movement to keep corporate America from taking
[17:16.560 --> 17:20.920]  what so many before us have sacrificed to give us.
[17:21.240 --> 17:21.320]  Well,
[17:21.320 --> 17:24.000]  that's a good reason to want to get into it because that corporate takeover is
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.640]  happening. Uh, it's becoming that way. It's a corporate industry.
[17:27.640 --> 17:32.640]  Now it's happening quickly. He also says, PS Irma has been the worst ripper ever.
[17:32.800 --> 17:36.840]  LOL. Thanks brother. Go smoke a fat dad and hug your mom. Wait a minute.
[17:36.840 --> 17:38.600]  I think you're supposed to hug your mom.
[17:38.600 --> 17:40.880]  You're supposed to take a fat dab and then you hug your mom for me.
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.560]  I guess I'll hug my mom for you. Is that how it's going to work?
[17:44.640 --> 17:46.160]  Hugs all around. Anyway, dude,
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.920]  I appreciate that you wanted to take some accountability and say, Hey,
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.360]  I sounded pretentious making it look like I'm some sort of consultant. Uh, dude,
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.080]  I like the accountability. That's pretty cool.
[17:55.080 --> 17:57.240]  Thanks for stepping up and saying that. Uh, man,
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.840]  sorry that Irma has ripped your crop. That's a bitch. Anyway, dude,
[18:01.840 --> 18:02.480]  thanks for the email.
[18:02.480 --> 18:04.840]  If you're listening to me and sub cool and you're learning from the internet,
[18:05.280 --> 18:08.160]  you are doing things correctly. Keep doing exactly what you're doing.
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.400]  Keep listening to the podcast. I look forward to your emails in the future.
[18:12.640 --> 18:13.320]  All right,
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.800]  I'm going to read one more email and this is going to work us into the main topic
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.440]  of the show. The email goes like this. It says, Hey, Ross to Jeff,
[18:20.440 --> 18:21.560]  had a quick question for you,
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.160]  but first wanted to let you know how great your podcast is. Hey, thanks dude.
[18:25.480 --> 18:28.560]  I read a lot of emails that start off like that and every time it means a lot to
[18:28.580 --> 18:31.040]  me, I put a lot of effort into this show. It takes a lot of time,
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.360]  a lot of energy, so I do appreciate every compliment. It goes on to say,
[18:35.560 --> 18:39.040]  or maybe she goes on to say, you are incredibly knowledgeable and well-spoken.
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.760]  It is a gold mine for newbies like me. I'm glad you found me.
[18:42.840 --> 18:45.280]  I'm glad I can help you out. The email continues to say,
[18:45.280 --> 18:48.680]  my main question is for someone like me who isn't in a legal state,
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.000]  what is my best bet on getting high quality seeds?
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.320]  I've been doing a lot of research and wondering about going with us banks or an
[18:56.320 --> 19:01.280]  overseas one. It goes without saying that my main concern is discreteness.
[19:01.440 --> 19:02.720]  I think you meant discretion, but Hey,
[19:03.200 --> 19:06.880]  we'll let you fly with quality and dependability coming in right behind any
[19:06.880 --> 19:10.000]  info or suggestions on this subject or just tips for the beginners.
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.760]  You can help me out with would be greatly appreciated. You're the man. Hey,
[19:14.760 --> 19:15.760]  yeah. Thanks for trusting me.
[19:16.320 --> 19:18.400]  Cause I've got some info for you that you're going to appreciate,
[19:18.640 --> 19:20.040]  but the email keeps going. It says, also,
[19:20.040 --> 19:24.640]  I just wanted to let you know how I feel like we have become buddies just from
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.480]  the short month I've been listening to you being pretty engulfed in standup
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.720]  comedy myself, along with Rogan's Joey Diaz's and other podcasts and being a
[19:32.720 --> 19:37.280]  deadhead myself. I feel like we are cut from the same cloth. Keep it up, my man.
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.720]  That's kind of cool that you say you feel like we're friends.
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.160]  I've always felt that the podcasters I've listened to for a long time,
[19:45.120 --> 19:47.920]  usually comedians. When I go see those comedians,
[19:47.920 --> 19:50.960]  I feel like I've already developed some sort of a relationship with them because
[19:50.960 --> 19:54.240]  I've been listening to Joey Diaz. That's a,
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.760]  you listed Joey right here in the email. I've been listening to Joey for years.
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.720]  I could say probably five years solid, maybe more than that.
[20:00.720 --> 20:03.000]  I honestly don't remember when I discovered uncle Joey,
[20:03.520 --> 20:06.760]  but I've been listening to Joey religiously. Every podcast he goes on,
[20:06.760 --> 20:09.840]  I listened to every episode he puts out. I go to any special.
[20:09.840 --> 20:13.240]  He does try to listen every time he comes to Denver. I'm there.
[20:13.600 --> 20:14.680]  When I'm there in Denver,
[20:15.360 --> 20:18.280]  I've tweeted the guy enough to where he recognizes my name.
[20:18.280 --> 20:21.080]  He recognizes my little Twitter icon. Uh, he,
[20:21.120 --> 20:23.480]  we know each other now and we don't know each other.
[20:23.520 --> 20:26.520]  We just know each other because I listened to him two days a week.
[20:26.760 --> 20:31.000]  Talk about whatever crazy shit he did in the eighties. And then when I see him,
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.040]  I tweet him enough to where he replies. And then when I see him,
[20:33.040 --> 20:35.400]  it's like we know each other. It's really neat. So man,
[20:35.840 --> 20:37.800]  I appreciate that you think we're friends. We are friends.
[20:37.800 --> 20:40.600]  If you're ever around in Colorado in my neck of the woods, hit me up.
[20:40.640 --> 20:44.240]  Let's take some dabs. We're bros. Now you're a part of the podcast family.
[20:45.080 --> 20:48.600]  And dude, uh, to put me to say anything about my podcast,
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.280]  and then include Rogan and Diaz in the same email. That's fucking awesome.
[20:52.280 --> 20:54.800]  That's a huge compliment. And then if you're a deadhead, bro,
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.040]  we are cut from the same cloth. We are, we are, we're a family.
[20:58.040 --> 21:02.040]  So let's smoke a dab one of these days. Now, let me answer your main question.
[21:02.040 --> 21:04.680]  Your main question is for someone like you who isn't in a legal state,
[21:04.680 --> 21:08.800]  what is your best bet on getting high quality seeds? I of course,
[21:08.800 --> 21:11.640]  recommend the dank team.com. They are in America.
[21:11.640 --> 21:14.960]  So you don't have to worry about any customs type shipping. Uh,
[21:14.960 --> 21:17.560]  let me say this to keep myself out of trouble. Um,
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.480]  if you buy seeds from anywhere,
[21:19.960 --> 21:23.200]  it is your responsibility to know the laws in your area.
[21:23.440 --> 21:26.080]  If you have seeds and it is illegal to grow them,
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.720]  be sure that you were only purchasing them for the intention of collecting and
[21:29.720 --> 21:32.360]  preserving those genetics. If it's illegal in your state,
[21:32.560 --> 21:34.600]  promise yourself that you will never grow those.
[21:34.600 --> 21:38.640]  You're only buying them to have them as a collectible so that perhaps something
[21:38.680 --> 21:41.680]  goes down and there's Armageddon and there are no more cannabis seeds.
[21:41.680 --> 21:45.680]  You could be the only one on the planet that's got these seeds preserved and
[21:45.680 --> 21:47.040]  it'll be like a historical thing.
[21:47.920 --> 21:52.040]  You're like a curator of fine quality cannabis collectibles.
[21:52.360 --> 21:56.120]  Also maybe one day your state will go legal and that's what you're waiting for.
[21:56.400 --> 21:56.960]  That's yeah.
[21:56.960 --> 22:00.000]  So don't buy seeds with the intention to grow them if you live in an illegal
[22:00.000 --> 22:00.840]  state,
[22:00.840 --> 22:04.440]  the dank team.com will ship you seeds to be used as collectibles.
[22:04.640 --> 22:07.640]  If you live in illegal States, if you live in, live in a legal state,
[22:07.640 --> 22:09.320]  feel free to grow them and see what comes out of them.
[22:09.320 --> 22:12.520]  You will be impressed and amazed. One thing that I've got to say,
[22:12.800 --> 22:16.120]  I don't know what happens if you get seeds shipped to you and you live in an
[22:16.120 --> 22:18.120]  illegal state and that package gets intercepted.
[22:18.320 --> 22:21.840]  I don't know what happens with that. I cannot be responsible for that.
[22:21.960 --> 22:25.760]  You may want to check with your own legal counsel or somebody like that.
[22:26.360 --> 22:30.400]  Figure it out before you do it and don't find out the hard way because honestly,
[22:30.680 --> 22:34.240]  I don't know what could happen to you or the sender. I don't know.
[22:34.280 --> 22:36.880]  I do know that the dank team.com is a reliable vendor.
[22:37.120 --> 22:40.440]  They've got a lot of great brands and they are in the States. Uh,
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.600]  you asked about discretion. They will ship everything to you very discreetly.
[22:44.640 --> 22:46.760]  You won't even know what's in there. Nobody will know what's in there.
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.280]  It'll blend in with the rest of the mail. Uh, quality, I can assure you,
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.360]  quality is top notch. They carry brands like alpha chronic mile high,
[22:54.480 --> 22:59.040]  can't adventure, sour seeds, irigenetics, rare dankness, DNA genetics.
[22:59.280 --> 23:02.120]  There's a whole bunch of good stuff on there. Uh,
[23:02.120 --> 23:05.680]  your next one is what are you looking for? Quality and dependability. Uh,
[23:05.680 --> 23:07.800]  I know that people at the dank team.com personally,
[23:07.800 --> 23:11.160]  they are friends of mine and they are dependable. Trust me on that.
[23:11.920 --> 23:16.040]  So any info and suggestions I recommend the dank team.com go check them out.
[23:16.640 --> 23:20.040]  Go right now, go check it out and let them know that Ross to Jeff sent you.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.560]  Tell him you listened to the grow from your heart podcast.
[23:21.560 --> 23:22.600]  I don't know if it'll help you out,
[23:22.600 --> 23:25.640]  but just let them know cause it may help me out in the future. All right.
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.000]  I want to thank you both for your emails.
[23:27.120 --> 23:29.720]  If anybody else out there has a question, you can send me an email.
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.000]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[23:33.200 --> 23:35.720]  I would love to answer your questions.
[23:35.880 --> 23:38.400]  Now since we're talking about purchasing seeds,
[23:38.640 --> 23:43.040]  I want to talk a little bit about expectations from a seed pack.
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.320]  I believe that if you have realistic expectations, when you buy seeds,
[23:49.480 --> 23:53.840]  you will be much less disappointed and much happier with your purchase.
[23:54.080 --> 23:57.280]  When the time comes to harvest your plants. If you think about it,
[23:57.440 --> 24:01.120]  it takes about 120 days to grow a crop of cannabis from a seed.
[24:01.120 --> 24:03.800]  It could take longer. It could take a little shorter. It depends on your style.
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.200]  I'm going to say 120 days, maybe 150 days to grow a crop of cannabis.
[24:08.440 --> 24:10.880]  That's four to six months to grow this crop.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.240]  You probably ordered the seeds depending on where you ordered from.
[24:14.240 --> 24:15.960]  It's going to take a week or two to get them there.
[24:16.200 --> 24:20.960]  So now you're looking at like four months plus two more weeks or 18 weeks.
[24:21.200 --> 24:23.960]  You probably shopped on the seeds for like a week and thought what you were
[24:23.960 --> 24:26.800]  going to buy. Then another week you had to wait for a paycheck.
[24:26.880 --> 24:30.800]  So you're looking at like 24 weeks from the time you purchase,
[24:30.920 --> 24:34.560]  from the time you decide to purchase the strain you're going to get to the time
[24:34.560 --> 24:36.000]  you actually get to cut them down.
[24:36.600 --> 24:40.480]  So it would make a lot of sense to do plenty of research and investigation
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.160]  before you order your seeds. Instead of buying some seeds,
[24:44.320 --> 24:47.280]  throwing them in the garden and then trying to figure out what you're going to
[24:47.280 --> 24:49.600]  do with these plants that you don't know what to expect.
[24:50.320 --> 24:54.320]  Most websites that sell seeds have very good description of what you can expect
[24:54.320 --> 24:57.360]  from those seeds. Those are mostly accurate.
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.040]  A lot of people are salespeople breeders want you to buy their seeds so they will
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.080]  butter up the descriptions just, just, just like any other product.
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.080]  So you have to find a breeder that you trust and then you have to find a seed
[25:09.080 --> 25:11.040]  line that has been out for a minute that's been tested.
[25:11.040 --> 25:13.040]  I know everybody wants to grab the hot new shit,
[25:13.280 --> 25:16.400]  but sometimes it's better to wait a little bit because sometimes when you grab
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.160]  the hot new shit, you find out that it really wasn't as hot. It was more shit.
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.520]  And then you've got a bunch of that in your grow room and you're disappointed.
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.520]  You've gone and spent a thousand dollars on this one breeder and bought 10 packs
[25:27.520 --> 25:28.040]  of his shit.
[25:28.040 --> 25:30.480]  And now you've got a bunch of crap in your grow because he released stuff
[25:30.480 --> 25:33.560]  without testing it. He put it out too early, something like that.
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.440]  So do some research before find a reputable breeder,
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.080]  find a strain that gets your attention, figure out what you're looking for.
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.880]  When you're shopping for seeds, there are several things to consider.
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.240]  Do you want an Indica? Do you want a sativa? What kind of effects do you want?
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.000]  Do you want it to be a mind racing thing? Do you want it to be a body thing?
[25:53.240 --> 25:55.600]  Is this for medicinal uses?
[25:55.600 --> 25:58.480]  Is somebody going to be smoking this cannabis for a medical reason?
[25:58.760 --> 26:01.200]  You need to find a strain that works for their medical condition.
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.040]  Hopefully they've been shopping around at dispensaries, buying different strains.
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.200]  Hopefully you've done some research and you know what kind of works for them.
[26:07.200 --> 26:09.800]  If you're a new grower, a new smoker, a new medical patient,
[26:10.120 --> 26:13.640]  you're going to have to do some research on what types of effects you want from
[26:13.640 --> 26:14.480]  these plants.
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.640]  So think about if you want Indica or sativa or a hybrid or what type of effect
[26:18.640 --> 26:21.000]  you're looking for. If you're going for the mind, for the body,
[26:21.200 --> 26:22.840]  think about stuff like that to start.
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.800]  Then you're going to need to think about height.
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.720]  Do you have a lot of height in your grow room? Can you grow real tall plants?
[26:29.040 --> 26:31.680]  Think about the space that you've got. You've got to buy plants.
[26:31.680 --> 26:34.720]  You've got to buy seeds that will produce plants that you're going to be able to
[26:34.720 --> 26:36.960]  fit into your space. If you've got a short space,
[26:37.200 --> 26:40.720]  you're not going to want super silver haze. If you've got a really tall space,
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.360]  you might want to put some taller hazes, some longer flowering plants in there.
[26:44.840 --> 26:46.520]  Just depends on how much space you've got.
[26:46.520 --> 26:48.400]  Think about that when you're shopping for seeds.
[26:48.840 --> 26:51.600]  Don't get hazes and sativas if you've got low ceilings,
[26:51.600 --> 26:52.840]  if you don't have a lot of room,
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.360]  think about how much time you want these crops to take.
[26:56.440 --> 26:59.040]  Think about how much time you can dedicate to flowering plants.
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.400]  You don't want to go by once again,
[27:01.400 --> 27:04.760]  you don't want to buy a haze plant that's going to take you 10 to 12 weeks.
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.760]  If you don't have 10 to 12 weeks to flower something, if you need product sooner,
[27:08.800 --> 27:09.920]  if you're a cash cropper,
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.160]  you want something that's closer to eight or nine weeks.
[27:12.400 --> 27:14.720]  If you're growing cause you want that head ripping sativa,
[27:14.840 --> 27:16.480]  you might want an 11 or 12 weeker,
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.120]  but think about that before you buy the seeds because once you've got them,
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.640]  there's no seed bank on the planet. That's going to take seeds back from anybody.
[27:23.680 --> 27:25.320]  You could open them up. You could have spit on them.
[27:25.600 --> 27:28.000]  You're gonna put other seeds in there. They don't take shit back.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.040]  All sales are final with all seed companies. So be careful.
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.160]  Also think about yields. What do you need? Big yields. Are you a cash cropper?
[27:37.160 --> 27:38.760]  Are you growing for medicinal reasons?
[27:39.200 --> 27:42.400]  You yields may be really important to you for a medical grower.
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.360]  Yields are important, but not as important.
[27:44.400 --> 27:46.080]  If you're growing for medicinal purposes,
[27:46.360 --> 27:50.240]  you need to worry that that specific phenotype and we're going to get to that.
[27:50.440 --> 27:54.400]  The specific strain has a specific phenotype that works for the specific
[27:54.400 --> 27:56.080]  patients, specific condition.
[27:56.480 --> 27:59.360]  And that's one of the beauties about growing from seed is you can select that
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.000]  for your patient. So maybe yield matters to you.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.840]  Yield matters to everybody because you have to pay for the electricity.
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.160]  You have to pay for the nutrients. You have to pay for the dirt.
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.520]  You have to pay for all of that.
[28:09.520 --> 28:13.640]  So hopefully you get enough yield to make it worth your time and your energy and
[28:13.680 --> 28:16.720]  your budget. How much work are these plants going to take?
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.760]  Something like I'm trying to find some strains that are Jilly bean.
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.360]  Jilly bean is really easy to grow. Jilly bean. You put her in dirt.
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.520]  You watch her grow. That's from TGA sub cool genetics.
[28:25.720 --> 28:27.240]  Shout out to my friends at TJ sub cool.
[28:27.320 --> 28:30.160]  See I could have used one of my own strains instead I used a sub cool genetics.
[28:31.240 --> 28:32.680]  Jilly bean. She's really easy to grow.
[28:32.680 --> 28:35.160]  You may need one stick in the middle just to hold that top coal up.
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.640]  If she gets real huge, if she gets real big branches,
[28:37.640 --> 28:40.360]  you may need a couple of sticks to hold those up. Put a stick on there,
[28:40.560 --> 28:43.760]  use a fuzzy tie or some plant tape or something just to hold those sticks.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.200]  The buds to the giant sticks. That's real easy.
[28:46.360 --> 28:50.320]  Jilly bean is really easy to grow. Uh, something like my bounty killer,
[28:51.040 --> 28:54.480]  bounty killer gets really long arms and grows really, really big.
[28:54.760 --> 28:57.920]  So she's a little harder to grow. She's going to need more space.
[28:57.960 --> 29:00.800]  She may need some trellising. She's going to need more work.
[29:01.040 --> 29:03.000]  So think about what you're able to do.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.680]  Can you get in there and put these plants under a trellis?
[29:05.680 --> 29:08.120]  Can you handle putting a lot of stakes in the plants?
[29:08.120 --> 29:09.400]  If you can't be there a lot,
[29:09.720 --> 29:12.880]  if you're just going to set up a hydro grow and leave and come back every now
[29:12.880 --> 29:13.880]  and then when you need to,
[29:14.240 --> 29:16.440]  then something like bounty killer wouldn't be ideal for you.
[29:16.440 --> 29:17.760]  Something more simple to grow.
[29:17.760 --> 29:19.800]  Something that you don't have to mess with a whole bunch.
[29:20.160 --> 29:21.400]  Cookie wreck from can of venture.
[29:21.400 --> 29:24.440]  I've got a phenotype of cookie wreck that you don't even have to water it.
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.200]  You'd water it once or twice and it just fucking lives forever.
[29:27.200 --> 29:30.600]  I don't know how it does it. It loves to be bone dry. It thrives when it's dry.
[29:30.960 --> 29:33.120]  So something like that, something that they say, Hey,
[29:33.120 --> 29:36.480]  it likes dry and the description that may be better for you.
[29:36.640 --> 29:40.240]  So think about how much work you're going to need to put into the strain that
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.240]  you are purchasing. If you're buying a short stocky Indica that finishes in eight
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.120]  weeks, it's not going to be a whole bunch of work.
[29:45.120 --> 29:47.760]  If you've got a tall stretchy sativa that takes 12 weeks,
[29:48.120 --> 29:49.680]  that's going to be a lot of fucking work.
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.880]  And if you haven't grown a lot of cannabis, do both of those things.
[29:52.880 --> 29:55.600]  Grow yourself an eight week Indica and then grow a 12 week sativa.
[29:55.880 --> 29:56.720]  See what it's like.
[29:57.400 --> 30:00.920]  If you've got a small room and you overcrowded yourself with that sativa and
[30:00.920 --> 30:04.000]  you've still got four more weeks to go, you're looking at life going, fuck,
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.080]  what am I going to do? It gets stressful.
[30:06.640 --> 30:09.320]  Anyway, think about aromas and flavors.
[30:09.760 --> 30:13.240]  The descriptions of the aromas and flavors are sometimes kind of fantastical.
[30:13.560 --> 30:17.040]  I would look for reviews on the strains. If you're going by flavors and aromas,
[30:17.720 --> 30:21.560]  sometimes the breeders will definitely inflate the, uh,
[30:21.600 --> 30:23.760]  the descriptions when it comes to flavors and aromas,
[30:23.760 --> 30:27.920]  they'll try to tell you that it tastes like bubble gum coated in sugar,
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.120]  coated in grape juice, rolled in pine needles. And by then you're lost.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.600]  Your tongue doesn't even know what the hell to think of.
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.080]  I try to keep my descriptions fairly to the point and really quick,
[30:37.080 --> 30:41.680]  but be careful if that's what you're shopping for also.
[30:42.840 --> 30:45.040]  And this is a big part of what I'm going to talk about,
[30:45.080 --> 30:50.080]  but read about the phenotypes or do research on the seeds that you're buying to
[30:50.400 --> 30:54.440]  see what types of variation come from those seeds. Those are called phenotypes.
[30:54.440 --> 30:59.000]  See what types of phenotypes are known for coming from those seeds and what the
[30:59.020 --> 31:01.280]  numbers are for getting those phenotypes.
[31:01.560 --> 31:04.160]  I like to use Jilly bean a lot when I talk about phenotypes,
[31:04.840 --> 31:08.080]  big shout out to miss Jill and sub cool from TGA genetics, but the Jilly bean,
[31:08.360 --> 31:10.360]  I like to talk about her. When I talk about phenotypes,
[31:10.360 --> 31:14.240]  there are three phenotypes that you generally get from a pack of Jilly bean.
[31:14.240 --> 31:16.800]  So if you pop 10 seeds, we'll see you get five males.
[31:16.800 --> 31:18.200]  Now you've got five females to deal with.
[31:18.200 --> 31:20.600]  You're probably going to have the candy store, Pheno,
[31:20.840 --> 31:24.120]  the orange Pheno and the one that is just kind of in the middle.
[31:24.120 --> 31:27.460]  That's just basic. It's the basic bitch. Pheno doesn't really have a name.
[31:27.460 --> 31:28.300]  It's not known,
[31:28.300 --> 31:32.620]  but that candy store and the orange Pheno are popular Pheno's. So you could,
[31:32.820 --> 31:35.820]  if you were going to buy some Jilly bean, you could go research what they look
[31:35.840 --> 31:38.580]  like, what they smell like. You could see pictures of both phenotypes.
[31:38.780 --> 31:41.620]  You could get very good descriptions of both phenotypes through the internet,
[31:41.620 --> 31:43.900]  through a little bit of searching. I'd go to web forums.
[31:43.900 --> 31:47.540]  I just searched for the name of the strain and then type Pheno variations or
[31:47.560 --> 31:49.700]  Pheno types available or common Pheno types.
[31:49.700 --> 31:51.260]  And it'll start showing you and you'll start seeing it.
[31:51.780 --> 31:54.480]  And then you'll know what your chances are of finding that one.
[31:54.480 --> 31:56.140]  It's kind of like buying baseball cards. You guys,
[31:56.340 --> 31:59.660]  sometimes we're all looking for that fucking Mickey Mantle and sometimes you
[31:59.680 --> 32:03.300]  find it. You just got to run seeds and you never know what you're going to get.
[32:03.300 --> 32:04.540]  But if you do some research,
[32:04.700 --> 32:08.700]  you know how many Mickey Mantle cards are put through how many packs.
[32:08.740 --> 32:12.700]  So you can at least think about if I buy a 10 pack of this strain,
[32:12.700 --> 32:16.420]  what are my chances of finding my keeper that I'm the Pheno type that I'm looking
[32:16.420 --> 32:20.780]  for? You could probably narrow it down a little by doing some research. All right.
[32:20.780 --> 32:23.740]  So once you've decided what strain you want to grow and who you're going to
[32:23.740 --> 32:25.940]  order from, there are several places to order you guys,
[32:25.940 --> 32:27.820]  but I highly recommend the dank team.com.
[32:27.820 --> 32:29.260]  They may not have everything you're looking for,
[32:29.260 --> 32:32.620]  but they have got plenty of good shit on there. So check them out. Uh,
[32:32.820 --> 32:34.660]  once you've decided what you're going to order and where you're going to order
[32:34.660 --> 32:38.220]  it from, you need to decide if you want regular or feminized seeds.
[32:38.500 --> 32:41.940]  Many of the strains available now come out in regular seeds.
[32:42.220 --> 32:43.380]  And then shortly after that,
[32:43.380 --> 32:46.060]  they are released by the same breeder in feminized form.
[32:46.700 --> 32:49.660]  Now if you're not familiar with feminized seeds, let me tell you what they are.
[32:50.100 --> 32:52.220]  When you grow cannabis from regular seeds,
[32:52.500 --> 32:55.220]  you have a chance of having male or female plants. Of course,
[32:55.220 --> 32:57.580]  in the cannabis garden, if you're growing for buds,
[32:57.580 --> 33:00.140]  you only want the female plants. You would remove the males.
[33:00.460 --> 33:02.180]  A lot of people don't want to deal with the males.
[33:02.300 --> 33:06.340]  So we have devised a way to create plants to create seeds.
[33:06.340 --> 33:09.900]  That will only create female plants. A lot of people think it's bullshit.
[33:09.900 --> 33:13.220]  A lot of people think they're hermaphrodites. I understand how it works.
[33:13.220 --> 33:17.220]  I can teach you how it works. It is not bullshit. They are not hermaphrodites.
[33:17.500 --> 33:20.020]  I can give you a brief lesson on how I do it because that's not what this
[33:20.020 --> 33:23.780]  episode is about. But quickly, here's how it goes. I take a female plant.
[33:24.020 --> 33:27.740]  I treat it with the product that I make at home. It is called silver thiosulfate.
[33:28.020 --> 33:29.820]  I treat the plant with silver thiosulfate.
[33:30.180 --> 33:32.780]  Each strain needs a different treatment regimen.
[33:32.780 --> 33:35.500]  Some plants want to get hit real hard with a heavy dilution.
[33:35.500 --> 33:38.980]  Some want to be sprayed more frequently with a lower dilution rate.
[33:39.300 --> 33:41.420]  It depends on the strain. You have to experiment with that.
[33:41.660 --> 33:44.300]  I will spray a female plant with silver thiosulfate.
[33:44.580 --> 33:47.180]  That female plant will put out a response.
[33:48.180 --> 33:50.900]  The silver disrupts the copper movement in the plant,
[33:50.900 --> 33:53.100]  which creates an ethylene reaction in the plant,
[33:53.100 --> 33:56.220]  which triggers the plant to produce male flowers.
[33:56.580 --> 34:01.580]  Those male flowers will produce pollen that only contains female chromosomes.
[34:01.900 --> 34:06.380]  Since my plant is a female, there are no male chromosomes in this plant.
[34:06.660 --> 34:08.780]  So the pollen that comes out is female.
[34:09.100 --> 34:13.860]  I put that pollen onto a female plant. I have only used female genes.
[34:14.140 --> 34:19.100]  So all of the progeny, the seeds will be female.
[34:19.340 --> 34:23.100]  If I did this correctly, they will all be females.
[34:23.140 --> 34:26.940]  And I know what I'm doing. So when I do this, it happens correctly.
[34:27.180 --> 34:30.020]  There's no witchcraft to it. There's no tricking the plant.
[34:30.020 --> 34:32.180]  There's no genetically modifying anything.
[34:32.500 --> 34:36.620]  This is just basic science from triggering the plant by treating it with the
[34:36.620 --> 34:37.460]  chemical.
[34:37.660 --> 34:41.100]  You disrupt one part of the plant to trigger a desired response.
[34:41.300 --> 34:43.700]  And I've done it several times. I've researched it very well.
[34:44.060 --> 34:46.340]  And this is how you make feminine, how we make feminized seeds,
[34:46.340 --> 34:49.700]  how I make feminized seeds. It's how modern feminized seeds are made. Now,
[34:49.700 --> 34:53.420]  I will give you guys credit that say that feminized seeds were all hermaphrodites
[34:53.420 --> 34:57.580]  back in the day, maybe a long time ago when the fem seeds started. Yes.
[34:57.780 --> 35:00.980]  The way they were doing that is just turning on the lights during the flowering
[35:00.980 --> 35:03.540]  cycle when they should be asleep, messing with the light cycle,
[35:03.540 --> 35:07.380]  messing with the photo period that will definitely cause plants to throw seeds.
[35:07.420 --> 35:11.180]  Those seeds do not have female only chromosomes.
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.420]  Those plants will have a tendency to have intersex traits,
[35:14.420 --> 35:17.260]  which mean they will be male and female at the same time.
[35:17.260 --> 35:18.660]  Also known as a hermaphrodite,
[35:18.860 --> 35:22.260]  also known as cut that shit down and get it out of my garden.
[35:22.500 --> 35:23.940]  So back in the day, yes,
[35:23.940 --> 35:26.860]  fem seeds were made with a little bit of shady, shitty practices.
[35:26.860 --> 35:30.900]  Now we understand what we're doing and feminized seeds are made with science,
[35:30.900 --> 35:33.540]  with research, and I believe in them and trust in them.
[35:33.740 --> 35:37.380]  So if you want to grow regular or feminized seeds, that is up to you.
[35:37.700 --> 35:41.100]  Many people are haters on feminized seeds. It's because they're not educated,
[35:41.220 --> 35:44.900]  but also a lot of people are haters on feminized seeds who are very educated
[35:44.900 --> 35:49.260]  because they feel like people breeding with feminized seeds will cause problems
[35:49.260 --> 35:52.860]  down the line. And they feel like feminized seeds, sort of bottlenecks,
[35:52.860 --> 35:56.500]  the progress of cannabis bottlenecks, the evolution bottlenecks are breeding.
[35:56.820 --> 35:59.060]  If some folks feel that way, I do not.
[35:59.380 --> 36:04.260]  I do take some responsibility by making way more regular seeds than I do
[36:04.260 --> 36:05.100]  feminized seeds.
[36:05.260 --> 36:08.860]  Try to counterbalance the damage that I do by making fem seeds.
[36:08.860 --> 36:10.660]  If anybody thinks I'm causing any problems,
[36:10.820 --> 36:13.340]  I just make way more regular seeds to kind of offset that.
[36:13.420 --> 36:16.620]  I don't see a problem with fem seeds. I think it's really helpful for a person.
[36:16.620 --> 36:20.460]  Who has here in Colorado, you're allowed to grow six plants legally.
[36:20.740 --> 36:24.100]  You can set up a grow wherever you want in your house, as long as it's secure.
[36:24.100 --> 36:25.420]  And you can grow six plants.
[36:25.420 --> 36:28.860]  Now you want to have all six of those come to fruition, hopefully.
[36:29.100 --> 36:33.060]  So six feminized seeds would be the way to go instead of throwing down six seeds
[36:33.060 --> 36:35.300]  and having three of them become boys. And now you've got to pull three,
[36:35.300 --> 36:37.100]  your plants only got three left. You're kind of fucked.
[36:37.100 --> 36:39.220]  You got all this wasted space. You thought you'd had six.
[36:40.220 --> 36:42.380]  That's where feminized seeds would come in very handy.
[36:43.140 --> 36:45.100]  So once you've decided what strain you want,
[36:45.100 --> 36:47.540]  and you've decided if you want regular or feminized seeds,
[36:48.460 --> 36:52.020]  that's when you go ahead and make your order, go to the website of your choice,
[36:52.300 --> 36:55.740]  thedankteam.com, find the strains you want. Then you make your order.
[36:55.780 --> 36:58.420]  And then you patiently wait for those seeds to come in the mail.
[36:58.420 --> 37:00.620]  If you're in an illegal state, you put them in a safe,
[37:00.820 --> 37:04.100]  you put them in a safe storage container and you collect them.
[37:04.540 --> 37:07.220]  If you are in a state where it is legal to grow cannabis,
[37:07.340 --> 37:11.300]  you germinate them and you grow them the best you can. All right.
[37:11.300 --> 37:14.460]  Now I want to talk about expectations of a seed pack.
[37:14.460 --> 37:16.260]  And I've kind of talked about selecting seed packs,
[37:16.260 --> 37:17.100]  but I haven't really taught,
[37:17.300 --> 37:21.180]  talked too much about what you should expect once you start growing your seeds.
[37:21.900 --> 37:26.900]  It seems to me like a lot of people think that every seed they plant is going to
[37:27.100 --> 37:27.740]  be a keeper.
[37:27.740 --> 37:31.740]  A lot of people seem to think that if they buy a 10 pack of whatever strain is
[37:31.740 --> 37:35.180]  hot today, that if they plant one of those seeds,
[37:35.180 --> 37:38.100]  it's going to grow and look just like the one in the picture,
[37:38.100 --> 37:42.860]  just like the one that whatever breeder posted on the website that you bought it
[37:42.860 --> 37:45.300]  from, you think it's going to look just like that. If you plant one seed,
[37:45.300 --> 37:48.260]  you think it's going to taste just like the one you bought from the dispensary.
[37:48.260 --> 37:52.300]  That one time you think it's going to get you high just like that. Maybe,
[37:52.420 --> 37:54.740]  maybe you're going to get super fucking lucky and it'll be that way.
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.700]  But chances are it is not like that.
[37:56.700 --> 38:00.580]  If you buy a 10 pack of seeds and you plant 10 seeds and they are regular seeds,
[38:01.500 --> 38:05.180]  you've got a 50 50 chance of each of those seeds being a male or a female.
[38:06.340 --> 38:09.180]  A friend of mine messaged me the other day and said that he got some seeds from
[38:09.180 --> 38:12.380]  me that I gave him and he told me every single one of those seeds in that
[38:12.380 --> 38:16.740]  package was a male. So he got a bunch of seeds and now he has zero shit growing
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.980]  because they were all males. It's really rare that you get a hundred percent
[38:19.980 --> 38:23.820]  males, but it's possible. It's also possible that you get all females,
[38:24.220 --> 38:29.220]  but science says you've got a 50 50 chance of getting a male or a female from
[38:29.300 --> 38:33.860]  each seed. So let's say you pop 10 seeds. Hypothetically, 50 50 chance happens.
[38:34.180 --> 38:37.020]  Five males came out. Those got cold. Those are pushed aside.
[38:37.020 --> 38:38.900]  Now you got five to choose from.
[38:40.140 --> 38:44.140]  If you see anything acting funky early in veg when it's still little,
[38:44.540 --> 38:47.860]  I get rid of those. If it's ugly, if it's not growing right, if it's slow,
[38:47.860 --> 38:50.180]  if it's shitty, if it's got a problem, I toss it.
[38:50.180 --> 38:54.460]  Why do I want to waste space and time and nutrients, money,
[38:54.500 --> 38:58.700]  lights air on something that is not going to be what I'm looking for.
[38:58.700 --> 39:01.380]  If it's small and shitty, it's always going to be small and shitty.
[39:01.580 --> 39:05.140]  Going to get rid of it or replace it with something better. So now we,
[39:05.140 --> 39:07.460]  let's say, let's say you got five females.
[39:07.500 --> 39:10.620]  Let's say one of them was just growing a little, little janky. She's gone.
[39:10.620 --> 39:13.260]  Now you've got four. Now you've got four to choose from.
[39:15.300 --> 39:18.100]  What does suck about seeds is there's variation.
[39:18.180 --> 39:21.580]  What is fucking awesome about seeds is there is variation. Yes.
[39:21.580 --> 39:24.580]  You want the one that looks like the picture that the breeder posted up to the
[39:24.580 --> 39:26.740]  website. Hopefully that's the one you get,
[39:27.260 --> 39:31.220]  but hopefully you get the one that grows perfectly for your space.
[39:31.500 --> 39:35.140]  Hopefully you get the one that smells just like you want. When you walk by,
[39:35.140 --> 39:36.380]  you go, damn, that smells good.
[39:36.820 --> 39:40.540]  Hopefully you find the one that gives you the effects you are after.
[39:40.540 --> 39:41.500]  If you're a medical patient,
[39:41.500 --> 39:45.420]  hopefully one of those four plants that's left is the phenotype that when you
[39:45.420 --> 39:48.620]  smoke it, all of your pain goes away or all of your anxiety goes away.
[39:48.980 --> 39:52.100]  Or you're able to dance like Michael Jackson or whatever your goal is.
[39:52.740 --> 39:56.220]  Hopefully you get to finish those four phenotypes and you get to smoke them.
[39:56.660 --> 39:58.900]  And one of them was the magic phenotype for you.
[39:58.900 --> 40:00.700]  That's the cool part about growing from seed.
[40:00.940 --> 40:04.540]  You get to find the one that is perfect for you.
[40:05.780 --> 40:08.380]  Now let me throw in a piece of advice here that is just kind of random,
[40:08.460 --> 40:11.020]  but it's something that I should say. Whenever you grow,
[40:11.060 --> 40:13.540]  whenever you get a new plant, if it's a clone, if it's a seed,
[40:13.540 --> 40:15.340]  whenever you grow a plant for the first time,
[40:15.540 --> 40:19.500]  make sure you take a clone of it because that may be the most amazing herb you've
[40:19.500 --> 40:21.020]  ever grown. And if you don't have a clone,
[40:21.020 --> 40:24.820]  if you don't have a copy of that to grow again, you might be heartbroken.
[40:24.820 --> 40:26.780]  It might be some of the worst shit you ever experienced.
[40:26.780 --> 40:31.620]  I had a plant years ago that I grew from seed and I tried to take clones of it so
[40:31.620 --> 40:34.900]  many times and none of the goddamn clones would root. I don't know why.
[40:34.940 --> 40:36.260]  I wasn't good at cloning back then,
[40:36.260 --> 40:39.100]  but I took enough clones to where at least one of those clones should have
[40:39.100 --> 40:41.660]  taken root and I should have that plant, but it just wouldn't root.
[40:42.060 --> 40:45.300]  And I smoked that weed and I was like, this, this is amazing cannabis.
[40:45.580 --> 40:46.740]  I smoked it with my buddy pops.
[40:46.740 --> 40:51.420]  I smoked it with Kevin and pop said that that was one of the top five best weeds
[40:51.420 --> 40:54.260]  he has ever smoked. And that old man is picky and stubborn.
[40:54.460 --> 40:56.660]  And if he said it was one of his top five, it was damn good weed.
[40:56.660 --> 40:58.660]  And I loved it and I don't have it.
[40:58.700 --> 41:01.940]  I'll never get to smoke it again because I couldn't get a clone of it and I'm
[41:01.940 --> 41:04.820]  sad about it. I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit shook and broken up over it.
[41:05.180 --> 41:07.460]  So take clones of everything that you grow. If it's the first time,
[41:07.460 --> 41:10.300]  keep one clone alive, find out if it's good,
[41:10.540 --> 41:12.660]  find out if you want to smoke that again. If you don't want to smoke it again,
[41:12.660 --> 41:14.140]  throw those clones away. If you love it,
[41:14.380 --> 41:16.780]  keep that clone and you can grow it over and over and over again.
[41:16.820 --> 41:20.340]  Turn that clone into a mother plant. You can take clones off it off of it for
[41:20.660 --> 41:22.100]  years. All right.
[41:22.100 --> 41:25.260]  So I want to get back to talking about the variation and finding the phenotypes.
[41:25.260 --> 41:28.740]  It does suck that you have variation in plants and it kind of depends on how far
[41:28.740 --> 41:31.780]  the breeder took that plant. F ones, you're going to find a lot of variation.
[41:32.100 --> 41:34.740]  F two, not so much. F three, it's going to narrow down.
[41:35.020 --> 41:36.580]  By the time you're to the F four F five,
[41:36.580 --> 41:38.300]  you're going to come out with fairly uniform plants,
[41:38.300 --> 41:41.900]  but you'll still find variations in there. I like the variation.
[41:42.260 --> 41:44.740]  So when you buy seeds, expect some variation.
[41:44.740 --> 41:47.780]  Don't think you can plant one and it's going to look just like the one on the
[41:47.780 --> 41:50.180]  picture or tastes just like the one you smoked at the dispensary.
[41:50.500 --> 41:53.460]  You're going to have to do some work. It's called a Fino hunt.
[41:53.780 --> 41:57.420]  When you're searching through those phenotypes to find the one that works best
[41:57.420 --> 42:00.380]  for you. That's a Fino hunt. An experienced grower like myself,
[42:00.380 --> 42:03.180]  loves a good Fino hunt. It keeps it fresh. It keeps it new.
[42:03.380 --> 42:05.660]  You got to keep an eye out for the males. You're excited.
[42:05.660 --> 42:07.820]  It's like when you're a kid and used to get a box of cereal and you,
[42:08.220 --> 42:10.620]  the fucking first thing you would do is go home and dig your arm all the way
[42:10.620 --> 42:13.260]  into the cereal and get all sugary and just try to find that prize and hope you
[42:13.260 --> 42:14.780]  got the cool prize that was on the box.
[42:15.060 --> 42:16.580]  That's kind of what it's like when you grow from seed.
[42:16.580 --> 42:18.500]  You just can't wait to see what you get.
[42:18.980 --> 42:21.820]  So you finish out those four and then you get to smoke them all.
[42:21.860 --> 42:25.540]  And then hopefully everybody in the room agrees quite often there'll be some
[42:25.540 --> 42:27.860]  disagreement. Everybody will be like, I really liked number two.
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.900]  And then somebody will be like, man, number four is the one.
[42:30.220 --> 42:32.260]  And then being the grower, you've got to decide,
[42:32.260 --> 42:34.980]  do you want the one that harvested the best or tasted the best?
[42:35.180 --> 42:37.740]  That's where you have decisions to make. Try to keep,
[42:37.740 --> 42:41.140]  maybe maybe the one that harvested the best, keep that one around.
[42:41.180 --> 42:43.700]  The one that works the best medically for you, keep that one around.
[42:43.700 --> 42:46.100]  And that way you can grow the medical one for your medical head stash.
[42:46.340 --> 42:49.700]  And you can grow the huge harvester just to have backup buds for when you smoke
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.860]  all that good shit. Maybe you can smoke them together,
[42:51.860 --> 42:55.500]  make it stretch a little bit. But the best part is you get to decide.
[42:55.500 --> 42:56.620]  You grew that from seed.
[42:56.860 --> 43:00.260]  You've got a custom strain now that nobody else has got around you because
[43:00.260 --> 43:02.620]  you've got that phenotype and nobody else has it.
[43:02.820 --> 43:05.140]  Hopefully you've got something brand new. If you're a cash cropper,
[43:05.460 --> 43:07.620]  if you're a black market grower, that's the way to go.
[43:07.660 --> 43:11.380]  Then you've got the new, new shit that nobody else has. All right.
[43:11.380 --> 43:13.700]  So when you buy seeds, keep in mind, there's going to be a little work.
[43:13.700 --> 43:16.660]  These are not tomatoes. They're not going to grow all the same.
[43:16.780 --> 43:19.340]  They are not clones. They're not going to grow all the same.
[43:19.380 --> 43:22.060]  They're not genetically modified. They're not going to grow all the same.
[43:22.540 --> 43:24.780]  These are seeds. There is nature happening here.
[43:25.340 --> 43:26.740]  A breeder can do so much work,
[43:26.780 --> 43:29.700]  but we cannot guarantee you what's going to come from a seed.
[43:29.900 --> 43:32.980]  Weird shit happens from seeds. Amazing shit happens from seeds.
[43:33.100 --> 43:36.900]  That's why I grow from seeds. You can grow something that nobody else has.
[43:36.900 --> 43:39.900]  You can find something that's way more amazing than the last seed you grew.
[43:40.140 --> 43:43.660]  You can keep growing more seeds. I love it. I love growing from seed.
[43:44.420 --> 43:47.020]  So I guess what I'm trying to say is expect some work.
[43:47.020 --> 43:50.100]  You're going to have to grow the seeds, take a clone of that seed,
[43:51.140 --> 43:54.180]  pull all of the males from the room. As soon as you see them showing male,
[43:54.220 --> 43:57.580]  pull those from the room, pull any slow or weird plants,
[43:57.580 --> 43:58.700]  get rid of those out of there.
[43:59.380 --> 44:03.660]  Then you got to finish out the phenotypes that you keep trim them, dry them,
[44:03.660 --> 44:06.860]  cure them, smoke them. If you have lab testing available, lab,
[44:06.860 --> 44:07.900]  test them if that's what you want.
[44:07.900 --> 44:10.980]  But I've talked in another episode that lab testing isn't always the way to go.
[44:11.220 --> 44:12.580]  Who cares what the lab test says.
[44:12.580 --> 44:16.980]  If you like smoking phenotype a and the lab test says that phenotype B has more
[44:16.980 --> 44:20.020]  THC, who cares? Keep number a, it's the one for you.
[44:20.060 --> 44:23.060]  You're not growing for a lab. You're growing for your medicinal needs.
[44:23.580 --> 44:26.780]  Worry more about that, but smoke it, finish it, get it lab tested.
[44:26.780 --> 44:30.380]  If you want to make some hash out of it, maybe if that's what you smoke,
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.460]  see what that does.
[44:31.740 --> 44:34.860]  Then choose the one that you really like or choose the two that you really like.
[44:34.860 --> 44:36.620]  I'm not going to make a limit. I'm not going to limit you.
[44:36.620 --> 44:39.540]  You can have as many as you choose, but pick the ones you like.
[44:39.780 --> 44:42.780]  You're rid of the ones that suck for you. And then you've got clones.
[44:42.820 --> 44:43.940]  Now you can redo it.
[44:44.300 --> 44:47.580]  I like to kind of narrow a 10 pack down to two or three and then grow those two
[44:47.580 --> 44:50.220]  or three again, side by side. And then I'll narrow it down to two.
[44:50.580 --> 44:52.220]  And then I like to think I'm going to narrow it down to one,
[44:52.220 --> 44:55.220]  but I always get fucking stubborn and keep two around for a real long time.
[44:55.620 --> 44:57.740]  And then eventually I'll get tired of growing one and I'll just,
[44:58.100 --> 44:59.620]  I'll get tired of growing the whole strain, honestly.
[44:59.660 --> 45:02.100]  And I'll just keep one of them around to have it in my library.
[45:02.780 --> 45:06.060]  And then I'll grow more seeds and then I'll find something better than one of
[45:06.060 --> 45:09.420]  the however many is in my stable. Usually I got about 20 female plants,
[45:09.420 --> 45:10.260]  maybe a little more.
[45:10.820 --> 45:12.820]  So I'll grow some seeds and I'll see what I like.
[45:12.820 --> 45:16.020]  And if I find one that really is better than one of those 20 or however many
[45:16.020 --> 45:18.460]  mother plants I've chosen to keep it, whatever facility I'm in,
[45:18.820 --> 45:21.020]  if one is better than I will just call one,
[45:21.020 --> 45:25.620]  like whatever the weakest link is we'll get replaced by the new seedling.
[45:26.260 --> 45:27.220]  But since I'm so stubborn,
[45:27.220 --> 45:30.780]  what ends up happening is I replaced that old one with two,
[45:30.820 --> 45:34.780]  like my two favorite new phenotypes until I get bored of growing that new strain
[45:34.780 --> 45:36.220]  until I start growing something new.
[45:36.540 --> 45:38.500]  And then I just toss one of them and put it in the,
[45:38.540 --> 45:42.300]  basically on the shelf for preservation with the rest of my mother plants.
[45:42.620 --> 45:45.060]  And then I will decide if I want to breed to it or whatnot.
[45:45.820 --> 45:47.100]  Once you start growing from seed,
[45:47.100 --> 45:49.420]  you may find yourself kind of becoming a plant hoarder,
[45:49.740 --> 45:52.340]  just wanting to pop more seeds, find that next phenotype,
[45:52.340 --> 45:54.180]  see what you can pull out of a seed pack. Next.
[45:54.540 --> 45:58.980]  It becomes a very addicting hobby, a passion, an art,
[45:59.260 --> 46:03.460]  whatever you want to call it. Growing from seed is a really fun thing to do.
[46:03.460 --> 46:07.020]  I really enjoy, I love growing from seed way more than I like growing from clone.
[46:07.340 --> 46:09.900]  I like clones cause I know what I'm going to get in a future episode.
[46:09.900 --> 46:11.900]  We will do the clone versus seed debate.
[46:12.380 --> 46:14.660]  We will also do the regular versus feminized debate.
[46:14.860 --> 46:17.460]  If you've got anything you'd like to contribute to those debates,
[46:17.660 --> 46:21.620]  you can send me info. Email me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[46:21.700 --> 46:25.620]  or tweet me at GFYH podcast. I would love to hear your side of the debate.
[46:26.220 --> 46:30.780]  And you never know. Maybe I'll use part of your email in the episode. All right,
[46:30.780 --> 46:33.300]  you guys, let's recap and start wrapping up this podcast.
[46:33.620 --> 46:35.820]  The short story is if you buy a pack of seeds,
[46:36.180 --> 46:39.660]  grow that pack of seeds and don't expect to find the exact one that you saw on
[46:39.660 --> 46:42.260]  the breeders website, you're going to have some variation.
[46:42.740 --> 46:45.420]  If you plant 10 seeds and they are regular or feminized,
[46:45.900 --> 46:48.740]  I wouldn't expect all 10 of those seeds to come to fruition.
[46:48.740 --> 46:50.540]  You may not harvest all 10 of those.
[46:50.580 --> 46:53.820]  Some of them may need to get cold for random reasons. You may have a male,
[46:53.980 --> 46:55.740]  you may have a hermaphrodite. Yes,
[46:55.740 --> 46:58.500]  regular seeds or feminized seeds can be hermaphrodites.
[46:58.500 --> 47:01.660]  You need to get those out of there. You may just have weird, weak plants.
[47:01.700 --> 47:04.740]  You may have a plant that grows way too tall, way too fast.
[47:04.740 --> 47:06.140]  You may have one that won't grow at all.
[47:06.260 --> 47:09.180]  Get rid of that shit so that you can have strong, healthy plants.
[47:09.180 --> 47:10.900]  You don't want to keep around something that's a piece of shit.
[47:11.140 --> 47:14.980]  So don't expect all 10 of your seeds that you plant to come to fruition.
[47:15.260 --> 47:19.420]  You are growing that first round to find the phenotype that works for you or your
[47:19.420 --> 47:22.460]  patient or your style or your needs or reaches your goal.
[47:22.460 --> 47:25.900]  The first grow with a seed pack is not meant to be really a production grow.
[47:25.900 --> 47:28.180]  You will have usable material, have usable product,
[47:28.420 --> 47:30.860]  but it's not a production run. You want to find the keeper.
[47:31.140 --> 47:33.540]  Then that's the one that you want to do your production runs with.
[47:33.780 --> 47:36.860]  Then you want to dial that one in, learn how much nutrients she wants,
[47:36.860 --> 47:39.900]  learn how much humidity she likes, learn how long you need to let her go.
[47:39.900 --> 47:42.820]  Maybe she needs eight, maybe nine, maybe 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[47:43.060 --> 47:44.700]  Pay attention to that. Get her dialed in.
[47:44.700 --> 47:48.820]  But the first run is just to find that phenotype that you're looking for.
[47:49.620 --> 47:50.540]  All right, podcast world.
[47:50.540 --> 47:53.500]  My throat is telling me that it is time to wrap up this episode.
[47:53.500 --> 47:55.300]  I want to thank you guys for listening to another show.
