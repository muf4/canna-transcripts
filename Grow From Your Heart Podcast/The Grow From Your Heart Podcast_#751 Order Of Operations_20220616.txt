[00:00.000 --> 00:32.780]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:32.780 --> 00:35.540]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:35.540 --> 00:40.440]  This is episode 751 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:40.440 --> 00:43.680]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of grow questions.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.180]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:47.180 --> 00:51.460]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:51.460 --> 00:54.080]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:54.080 --> 00:55.080]  Thank you.
[00:55.080 --> 00:56.640]  Shout out to my buddy, Stoner Dave.
[00:56.640 --> 00:57.640]  Let's send a big thank you.
[00:57.640 --> 00:58.640]  Shout out to Sam Heads.
[00:58.640 --> 01:00.380]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you.
[01:00.380 --> 01:02.960]  Shout out to B. Bala and Doc Grose.
[01:02.960 --> 01:04.280]  Let's send a big Canadian thank you.
[01:04.280 --> 01:06.740]  Shout out to my buddy, Caribou Heart TV.
[01:06.740 --> 01:07.740]  Let's send a thank you.
[01:07.740 --> 01:10.120]  Shout out to a longtime supporter, Glenn Geroni.
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.120]  Let's send a thank you.
[01:11.120 --> 01:12.640]  Shout out to Frogman and Kip.
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.640]  Let's send a thank you.
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.160]  Shout out to Brian P. and Double D. Let's send a big thank you to my good friend, Trollin.
[01:18.160 --> 01:21.480]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.480]  Thank you.
[01:22.480 --> 01:24.140]  Shout out to Elders Garden.
[01:24.140 --> 01:29.100]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:29.100 --> 01:32.760]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:32.760 --> 01:39.220]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:39.220 --> 01:42.000]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.760]  I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and
[01:46.760 --> 01:50.640]  easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.880]  Speaking of supporting the show, I want to start by saying thank you to everybody who
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.880]  sent me feedback and constructive criticism on the last episode.
[01:58.880 --> 02:02.440]  I previously asked about what do you like and dislike about the show.
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.040]  Would you like to see more solo shows?
[02:04.040 --> 02:05.800]  Would you like to see more guests?
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.800]  I got a lot of great feedback, a lot of great responses.
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.800]  Thank you.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  I do appreciate that.
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.960]  It really helps me to make a quality show that you enjoy if I know what you enjoy.
[02:15.960 --> 02:22.520]  The number one response and request that I did get from that feedback was longer podcasts.
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.720]  I would love to give you longer podcasts, but just being me sitting here rambling at
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.760]  a camera with a few notes in front of me, it feels really weird going for longer than
[02:31.760 --> 02:33.760]  25, 35 minutes.
[02:33.760 --> 02:37.760]  It's hard to talk to yourself for that long without somebody at least nodding at you and
[02:37.760 --> 02:38.760]  replying.
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.040]  I'm just sitting here with a camera looking at me, but it gets weird after about 30 minutes
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.040]  or so.
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.240]  I feel like I'm just talking at the wall because I'm just talking to a camera lens.
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.000]  It doesn't give me any feedback, which is hard to do.
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  I've gotten good at it.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.440]  The Instagram lives definitely help.
[02:52.440 --> 02:56.240]  On the Instagram, I do get the comments and some feedback in there, but that does help
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.360]  me get going here.
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.840]  I'm just talking at the wall, so it's hard to carry on a 30-minute conversation by myself.
[03:02.840 --> 03:05.680]  Then also, my voice will burn out.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.380]  I don't get a time to let my throat cool down.
[03:09.380 --> 03:14.740]  My moisten, I guess, doesn't get any rest while the other person talks because it's
[03:14.740 --> 03:15.740]  just me talking.
[03:15.740 --> 03:17.900]  It's hard to do more than 30 minutes or so.
[03:17.900 --> 03:18.900]  The voice burns out.
[03:18.900 --> 03:20.460]  Then also, the ADD burns out.
[03:20.460 --> 03:23.300]  I start thinking about, well, now I have to edit this long-ass show.
[03:23.300 --> 03:24.860]  I got to get the show up to the internet.
[03:24.860 --> 03:29.420]  Also, another thing that you guys probably don't care about is when I do the multi-cam
[03:29.420 --> 03:33.080]  shows and they get real long, they take a long time to edit.
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.500]  That stuff does come to mind when I'm making longer shows, but mainly it's because I just
[03:37.620 --> 03:40.100]  can't talk for 30 minutes by myself.
[03:40.100 --> 03:43.240]  The other request was that I do bring Mike on more frequently.
[03:43.240 --> 03:47.220]  People do seem to enjoy having Mike on the podcast, which does, of course, result in
[03:47.220 --> 03:50.260]  longer shows because Mike can talk quite a bit as well.
[03:50.260 --> 03:53.260]  In the future, you will see some shows with Mike.
[03:53.260 --> 03:58.180]  The general survey says that they do want Mike on about a third of the shows, maybe
[03:58.180 --> 04:02.180]  a quarter, maybe a fifth of the shows, somewhere in that area, but not every show, but they
[04:02.180 --> 04:03.180]  do want to hear from Mike.
[04:03.180 --> 04:04.420]  We'll get Mike on.
[04:04.420 --> 04:07.080]  Mike, this is an official invitation.
[04:07.080 --> 04:08.080]  You're going to babysit her.
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.280]  Come be on the show.
[04:09.280 --> 04:10.480]  Let's talk about some cool shit.
[04:10.480 --> 04:11.480]  All right.
[04:11.480 --> 04:12.840]  I feel like I'm rambling.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.920]  My main point of that start of the show there was thank you, you guys, for the great constructive
[04:16.920 --> 04:20.160]  criticism, the positive feedback, steering me in the right direction.
[04:20.160 --> 04:22.160]  I do appreciate that.
[04:22.160 --> 04:24.560]  Sometimes we all do need a little bit of encouragement.
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.300]  If I don't ask you what I'm doing right and wrong, you might not tell me, so I'll never
[04:28.300 --> 04:29.300]  figure it out.
[04:29.300 --> 04:30.300]  All right.
[04:30.300 --> 04:33.480]  The next order of business on the list of things to cover is something I'm very excited
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.480]  about.
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.800]  I know I've mentioned or hinted about this previously, but iReed Direct is live.
[04:39.800 --> 04:40.800]  That's right.
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.920]  If you check out my website, iReedGenetics.com, on the top in the middle row of things you
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.420]  can select, the options is what those are.
[04:48.420 --> 04:50.440]  There is one that says iReed Direct.
[04:50.440 --> 04:51.840]  Guess what that gets you to?
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.800]  That takes you right to iReed Direct, where you can get some iReed Genetics direct from
[04:56.800 --> 04:58.000]  the breeder.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  That's right.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.580]  That menu will change often.
[05:00.580 --> 05:02.160]  Things will be updated frequently.
[05:02.160 --> 05:04.520]  Some things will sell out and not get updated.
[05:04.520 --> 05:06.600]  Some things will be restocked frequently.
[05:06.600 --> 05:07.800]  You've just got to pay attention.
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.840]  Also, if you were on the Discord, the Discord occasionally will notify you when I do some
[05:12.840 --> 05:14.200]  updates and things like that.
[05:14.200 --> 05:18.720]  There will, of course, be a link to the Discord in the show notes and the video description,
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.080]  so make sure you check out the Discord.
[05:20.080 --> 05:24.080]  You will get a link to the iReed Direct page if you need that.
[05:24.080 --> 05:28.240]  Of course, you can find it at iReedGenetics.com, but the Discord will give you the updates
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.640]  when there are new drops.
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.520]  Also, a good way to stay updated on the new drops is to join the newsletter.
[05:34.520 --> 05:39.360]  When you go to the website iReedGenetics.com, there is an opportunity to join the newsletter.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.120]  Simply type in your email address.
[05:41.120 --> 05:45.440]  I will send out a newsletter approximately once a month, maybe every other month.
[05:45.440 --> 05:48.840]  I try not to spam you too much if I don't have a lot to talk about.
[05:48.840 --> 05:54.120]  I'm going to give out coupons very soon for the iReed Direct website.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.520]  Patreon will get coupons.
[05:55.520 --> 05:57.240]  The Discord will get coupons.
[05:57.240 --> 05:59.000]  The newsletter will get coupon codes.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.120]  Do of course join the newsletter.
[06:02.120 --> 06:03.840]  Also of course join the Patreon.
[06:03.840 --> 06:06.800]  And of course do join us on Discord.
[06:06.800 --> 06:07.840]  Where do we go from there?
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.040]  I've got one more very important order of business to cover.
[06:12.040 --> 06:16.440]  I will be at the Dude Grows Cup Saturday, July 30th.
[06:16.440 --> 06:17.440]  Join me.
[06:17.440 --> 06:18.440]  The event starts at 2pm.
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.120]  The party ends at 8pm.
[06:20.120 --> 06:22.240]  It is just outside of Fort Collins.
[06:22.240 --> 06:24.060]  I will be there.
[06:24.060 --> 06:25.760]  So far I think White Mike will be there.
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.280]  I should have somebody else there with me.
[06:27.520 --> 06:30.480]  Don't want to make any plans or announcements or promises yet until we get a little bit
[06:30.480 --> 06:31.480]  closer.
[06:31.480 --> 06:33.680]  But I think we will have a great team there.
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.680]  Come hang out with us.
[06:34.680 --> 06:37.480]  A lot of cool members of the iReed Army will be showing up.
[06:37.480 --> 06:42.280]  A lot of people are traveling from all over the country, possibly all over the world to
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.760]  come hang out with us at the Dude Grows Cup.
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.520]  So do please join us.
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.580]  That is once again July 30th.
[06:48.580 --> 06:49.580]  That is a Saturday.
[06:49.580 --> 06:51.300]  The event does start at 2pm.
[06:51.300 --> 06:52.800]  It will end around 8pm.
[06:52.800 --> 06:53.800]  We do invite you.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.760]  It is just outside of Fort Collins.
[06:55.760 --> 07:02.520]  For all of the deets, links, details, anything you may need, do check out DudeGrows.com.
[07:02.520 --> 07:03.520]  They will get you tickets.
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.620]  They will get you laced up.
[07:04.620 --> 07:05.620]  Check it out.
[07:05.620 --> 07:08.920]  This is a cannabis tasting event, a cannabis competition.
[07:08.920 --> 07:11.640]  Everybody that shows up will be given a fresh one hitter.
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.360]  They will be given a lighter and then they will be allowed to sample all of the entries
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.160]  that have entered the competition.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.400]  It will be a good time.
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.780]  Also many of your favorite seed breeders will be there vending.
[07:22.780 --> 07:23.780]  So come say hi.
[07:23.780 --> 07:27.740]  We will have a lot of great things prepared for the Dude Grows Cup.
[07:27.740 --> 07:31.900]  All right, I have one more very, very important message that we do have to read.
[07:31.900 --> 07:36.000]  This might be the most important message in today's episode.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.300]  This one came from Patreon and it goes a lot like this.
[07:39.300 --> 07:42.520]  It says, Rasta Jeff, thanks for addressing my question on the show.
[07:42.520 --> 07:43.520]  Much appreciated.
[07:43.520 --> 07:46.580]  I think I'm going to change my methods for the foreseeable future.
[07:46.580 --> 07:49.020]  But then it says, I appreciate you bro.
[07:49.020 --> 07:53.500]  In a completely unrelated note, was it you that I heard about frying a peanut butter
[07:54.220 --> 07:55.940]  and jelly sandwich like a grilled cheese?
[07:55.940 --> 07:58.300]  I had one last night and it was unreal.
[07:58.300 --> 08:01.780]  I'm pretty sure I heard about it from you a while back, but I wasn't sure.
[08:01.780 --> 08:04.580]  If that tip was you, then big ups once again, bro.
[08:04.580 --> 08:07.260]  That definitely was from me.
[08:07.260 --> 08:11.780]  I did talk about in the 7-Eleven episode, episode number 7-Eleven was all about the
[08:11.780 --> 08:12.780]  munchies.
[08:12.780 --> 08:16.460]  I hope you guys got the joke that I did there, 7-Eleven and the munchies.
[08:16.460 --> 08:21.300]  I did an episode talking about snacks and munchies and I did mention a fried or maybe
[08:21.300 --> 08:23.380]  a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[08:23.420 --> 08:27.220]  So if you make yourself a normal peanut butter and jelly sandwich, slap butter on the outsides
[08:27.220 --> 08:30.700]  of both pieces of the bread and throw that fucker in a hot pan, grill it like you would
[08:30.700 --> 08:35.980]  a grilled cheese sandwich and that peanut butter and that jelly make this melty, schmelty,
[08:35.980 --> 08:39.560]  gooey warm texture flavor in the middle that is just amazing.
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.960]  So big up to our friends here for following the guidance, following the advice, experiencing
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.100]  life and enjoying the grilled or the fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[08:50.100 --> 08:51.800]  I'm glad you found out about that.
[08:51.800 --> 08:52.980]  Thanks for reporting back.
[08:52.980 --> 08:53.980]  Enjoy.
[08:53.980 --> 08:55.820]  Okay, let's focus in a little bit.
[08:55.820 --> 08:58.300]  I did say that I had some Grow questions here.
[08:58.300 --> 09:02.500]  I've got a Grow question that came from the website from the Grow Help tab.
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.500]  This one came from our friend.
[09:03.500 --> 09:05.260]  Oh, it says, keep me anonymous.
[09:05.260 --> 09:08.500]  This one came from our friend Anonymous and it goes a lot like this.
[09:08.500 --> 09:13.460]  It says, Rasta Jeff, when you switch to 18-6 at the end of the flowering cycle, do you
[09:13.460 --> 09:17.380]  reduce the intensity of the lights or just let them rip?
[09:17.380 --> 09:19.780]  I'm thinking about their DLI needs.
[09:20.340 --> 09:22.380]  If you do reduce the power, okay, I don't.
[09:22.380 --> 09:24.980]  So we don't even need to talk about that.
[09:24.980 --> 09:27.740]  So let's kind of recap what our friend is talking about.
[09:27.740 --> 09:34.540]  I have been preaching a method, a technique of I switch my lights back to 18 hours on
[09:34.540 --> 09:37.720]  and six hours off at the end of a flowering cycle.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.300]  Many people think that that is absolutely crazy.
[09:40.300 --> 09:44.840]  They think I'm fucking everything up by doing this, but it has proven to be very successful
[09:44.840 --> 09:45.840]  for me.
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.140]  I learned this by doing it to my seeded crop.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.940]  I learned that my seeds become more healthy.
[09:50.940 --> 09:52.780]  They harden up faster.
[09:52.780 --> 09:54.860]  They're bigger, stronger, faster, more vigorous.
[09:54.860 --> 09:56.180]  I get a better germination rate.
[09:56.180 --> 10:01.740]  I get more successful seeds from a crop by switching my flowering lights to 18 hours
[10:01.740 --> 10:05.140]  on and six hours off toward the end of flower.
[10:05.140 --> 10:08.980]  When I'm doing this with the flowering crop that is not seeded, I generally do this when
[10:08.980 --> 10:10.060]  I begin to flush.
[10:10.060 --> 10:16.020]  The final 10 to 14 days or so is when I will do the 18 hours on and six hours off.
[10:16.020 --> 10:21.060]  One note that I have been stressing that people make sure to follow this word of advice.
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.260]  Please listen to this one.
[10:22.260 --> 10:29.140]  If you're going to do the 18 six, do not do it on the first run with a plant.
[10:29.140 --> 10:30.580]  Learn the plant.
[10:30.580 --> 10:33.500]  See how long that plant takes to finish.
[10:33.500 --> 10:38.100]  Then you know when to change the timer to 18 six next time.
[10:38.100 --> 10:40.180]  Let the plants finish the first run.
[10:40.180 --> 10:42.060]  Don't do this on a brand new plant.
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.960]  This is not a first date trick.
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.280]  This is a trick for a plant that you've got some experience with.
[10:48.280 --> 10:54.360]  At the end of flower, during the flush phase, I will turn my lights back on from 12 12 to
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.000]  18 hours on and six hours off.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.760]  Now I'm giving them half a day more worth of light, more worth of photons, more energy
[11:02.760 --> 11:09.920]  for growth, more robust, fat, dense buds is basically what you're going to get or in my
[11:09.920 --> 11:12.640]  case, bigger, fatter, healthier seeds.
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.200]  I do just straight turn the light timer on to 18 six and I do not change the intensity
[11:18.200 --> 11:19.320]  of the lighting at all.
[11:19.320 --> 11:21.080]  I don't want to reduce the intensity.
[11:21.080 --> 11:24.400]  I want to give them more light, longer days, let them grow.
[11:24.400 --> 11:27.580]  Now people are going to say your plants are going to re veg.
[11:27.580 --> 11:32.520]  It takes much longer for the plants to re veg than it does for them to beef up and swell
[11:32.520 --> 11:34.480]  in time for the harvest.
[11:34.480 --> 11:37.260]  That's why I talk about don't do this on your first run.
[11:37.260 --> 11:40.980]  If you do this on the second and third run, we know when the harvest will be.
[11:40.980 --> 11:42.340]  You kick it right in time.
[11:42.340 --> 11:46.120]  You cut down before anybody re veg is you don't cause any problems.
[11:46.120 --> 11:51.940]  So the short answer is no, I do not reduce the amount of light when I switched 18 six.
[11:51.940 --> 11:53.060]  I keep them banging.
[11:53.060 --> 11:58.660]  I keep them going and I do it business as usual until the plants are done.
[11:58.660 --> 11:59.660]  Very good question.
[11:59.660 --> 12:00.660]  Thank you for that one.
[12:00.660 --> 12:02.900]  Uh, thanks for letting me know to keep you anonymous.
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.420]  I do appreciate that.
[12:04.420 --> 12:05.420]  All right.
[12:05.420 --> 12:07.740]  I do have another message right here in front of me.
[12:07.740 --> 12:09.060]  This one came from our friend.
[12:09.060 --> 12:11.020]  They want their name said.
[12:11.020 --> 12:12.020]  They know who they are.
[12:12.700 --> 12:14.820]  I'm going to send this to you by J H what up J H good to see you bro.
[12:14.820 --> 12:15.980]  You send me a lot of questions.
[12:15.980 --> 12:19.780]  I don't read them all on the show, but I do read them all on the screen.
[12:19.780 --> 12:22.220]  I don't reply to every single one of them.
[12:22.220 --> 12:24.940]  Please do keep sending me your great questions.
[12:24.940 --> 12:25.940]  You're a smart person.
[12:25.940 --> 12:29.880]  You got some great ideas, uh, but you should go outside and get away from the computer
[12:29.880 --> 12:32.360]  for just a couple of minutes.
[12:32.360 --> 12:33.360]  Nothing but love bro.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.360]  This question goes on.
[12:34.360 --> 12:36.340]  It says, what's up Ross to Jeff.
[12:36.340 --> 12:40.780]  What is your personal order of importance in your grow operation?
[12:40.780 --> 12:43.740]  How would this change at home versus commercially?
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.060]  Then he kind of touches it up.
[12:45.060 --> 12:50.100]  It says, is there an order in which you enter and exit your grow areas to prevent bringing
[12:50.100 --> 12:55.780]  issues from one area to another, like an order of workflow?
[12:55.780 --> 12:56.780]  Then it follows up with it.
[12:56.780 --> 13:00.500]  Does your mother room have a special entrance or exit or plan?
[13:00.500 --> 13:02.500]  Are there any special procedures?
[13:02.500 --> 13:04.720]  Then there's some more stuff that we don't really need to cover a lot right now.
[13:04.720 --> 13:06.900]  We can jump right into this.
[13:06.900 --> 13:08.620]  This is a good question.
[13:08.620 --> 13:13.100]  The first part of the question, um, is there an order of importance in your grow?
[13:13.100 --> 13:15.780]  Then it says, would it change at home versus commercially?
[13:15.780 --> 13:17.380]  I can answer that very easily.
[13:17.380 --> 13:18.380]  Yes.
[13:18.380 --> 13:22.940]  In a personal grow versus a commercial grow, the order of operations, the importance of
[13:22.940 --> 13:25.300]  operations change drastically.
[13:25.300 --> 13:28.700]  In a commercial environment, uh, we've got a lot of people going in and out.
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.020]  There's at least three to five, maybe 10, maybe 20 people going in and out of any commercial
[13:33.020 --> 13:36.300]  environment at any time that are regular employees.
[13:36.300 --> 13:41.180]  You've got your lead cultivator, then you got your grow tax, and then you got your,
[13:41.180 --> 13:42.820]  uh, your helpers.
[13:42.820 --> 13:47.620]  And then you got your trim crew, your lead trimmer, your harvest manager, um, your compliance
[13:47.620 --> 13:48.620]  manager.
[13:48.620 --> 13:50.060]  There's a bunch of people running through there.
[13:50.060 --> 13:54.660]  Then also sometimes ownership shows up like the owners aren't employees.
[13:54.660 --> 13:55.660]  They're not there every day.
[13:55.660 --> 13:59.100]  They don't give a shit about standard operating procedures.
[13:59.100 --> 14:01.980]  Sometimes you could tell the owner, we do it this way and they go, that's fine.
[14:01.980 --> 14:02.980]  I'm going to go in there.
[14:02.980 --> 14:03.980]  I'm going to do it.
[14:03.980 --> 14:06.380]  But we all put on Tyvek suits and fucking tie up our hair.
[14:06.380 --> 14:08.740]  And the owner goes, I'm going to wear my dress and my high heels in there.
[14:08.740 --> 14:09.900]  And I don't give a fuck what you think.
[14:09.900 --> 14:12.780]  And you go, you own it and you get to do what you got to do.
[14:12.780 --> 14:16.040]  So we had a lot of people come in and go in through the grow.
[14:16.040 --> 14:18.100]  Sometimes we have contractors in there.
[14:18.100 --> 14:21.380]  I assume just because that's what I, my brain works.
[14:21.380 --> 14:25.700]  I assume that those contractors came from another grow before they worked in my grow.
[14:25.700 --> 14:26.820]  That's just what my brain thinks.
[14:26.820 --> 14:31.220]  I think everybody that shows up in a commercial facility just came from another commercial
[14:31.220 --> 14:32.220]  facility.
[14:32.460 --> 14:33.460]  That's just what they do.
[14:33.460 --> 14:34.460]  That's all we think about.
[14:34.460 --> 14:35.780]  That's just, that's not real, but that's what my brain thinks.
[14:35.780 --> 14:38.900]  So we've got a lot of people coming and going is my point here.
[14:38.900 --> 14:44.020]  Some people I can kind of, and I don't want to say control, but I can control the coming
[14:44.020 --> 14:45.180]  and going of some people.
[14:45.180 --> 14:49.500]  I can control the procedures of some people, the cleanliness, uh, the approach to some
[14:49.500 --> 14:50.820]  people, other people.
[14:50.820 --> 14:52.100]  I cannot ownership.
[14:52.100 --> 14:54.020]  I can't, I am a paid consultant.
[14:54.020 --> 14:57.660]  I can recommend things to the owner, but I cannot tell the owner what to do.
[14:57.660 --> 14:59.060]  I can fire employees.
[14:59.060 --> 15:00.060]  I can hire employees.
[15:00.060 --> 15:01.900]  The owner can fire me.
[15:02.580 --> 15:05.820]  So I can recommend that you don't wear the high heels and the skirt into the grow room
[15:05.820 --> 15:07.900]  that you put on the Tyvek suit like the rest of us.
[15:07.900 --> 15:11.300]  But if she wants to look hot, that's what she is going to fucking do today.
[15:11.300 --> 15:17.340]  So the order of importance definitely does change in a personal grow compared to a commercial
[15:17.340 --> 15:18.340]  grow environment.
[15:18.340 --> 15:21.660]  Like I said, we've got so many people coming in a commercial grow.
[15:21.660 --> 15:24.620]  Also there's so much more at stake in a commercial grow.
[15:24.620 --> 15:27.340]  If my personal grow fails, uh, I will survive.
[15:27.340 --> 15:31.220]  I won't make a crop of seeds or I won't make a batch of flowers and Mike won't get to smoke
[15:31.220 --> 15:34.340]  and we won't have as good of a time, but life will go on.
[15:34.340 --> 15:35.340]  Shit will continue.
[15:35.340 --> 15:39.660]  If we ruin a crop at a commercial grow because we let somebody bring in some bugs or I brought
[15:39.660 --> 15:44.660]  in some bugs or there was a mistake, there are millions of dollars at risk there.
[15:44.660 --> 15:51.140]  Um, one crop, one major crop failure in the commercial market right now could destroy
[15:51.140 --> 15:52.940]  a commercial grow.
[15:52.940 --> 15:59.180]  If that commercial grow were to fail, it could also destroy their medically infused product
[15:59.180 --> 16:04.460]  facility, which would be, so the grow is where the flowers are grown, obviously, right?
[16:04.460 --> 16:06.220]  They don't, the flowers aren't sold from there.
[16:06.220 --> 16:11.100]  They are then taken either directly to the dispensary for sale, which is my next Avenue,
[16:11.100 --> 16:16.260]  or they are taken to a medically infused products laboratory where they are turned into a concentrate,
[16:16.260 --> 16:20.940]  turned into edibles, turned into a lotion, turned into a lubricant.
[16:20.940 --> 16:25.860]  They do all kinds of shit with it, but that medically infused products facility would
[16:25.860 --> 16:27.220]  also go under.
[16:27.260 --> 16:32.180]  If the grow sinks, so do all of these subsequent facilities, which is the medically infused
[16:32.180 --> 16:34.940]  processor and the dispensary attached to it.
[16:34.940 --> 16:40.820]  So the one crop could ruin three businesses that all fall under one business entity, which
[16:40.820 --> 16:45.700]  would mean you got probably 15, 20 people at the dispensary or at the grow working,
[16:45.700 --> 16:49.980]  uh, probably maybe five or 10 people, depending on your medically infused, uh, whatever you
[16:49.980 --> 16:52.460]  got going on, you got five to 20 people there.
[16:52.460 --> 16:55.460]  Then at the dispensary, you got probably 20 people working there.
[16:55.460 --> 16:59.420]  There's going to be somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that are fired and are
[16:59.420 --> 17:01.660]  out of work because of one crop failure.
[17:01.660 --> 17:03.800]  So things are much more critical.
[17:03.800 --> 17:06.740]  Things are much tighter in a commercial environment.
[17:06.740 --> 17:09.900]  Also something that, um, it matters.
[17:09.900 --> 17:10.900]  It does make a difference.
[17:10.900 --> 17:15.580]  We cannot use the same methods of eradication in a commercial environment.
[17:15.580 --> 17:22.020]  I do my best to stick to Colorado department of agriculture and Colorado marijuana enforcement
[17:22.020 --> 17:27.980]  division regulations when it comes to pesticides and fungicides and cleanliness and things
[17:27.980 --> 17:30.380]  like that within my personal grow.
[17:30.380 --> 17:35.380]  But honestly, when people, um, if I were to, uh, get a clone from a friend, I'm trying
[17:35.380 --> 17:36.620]  to think of how to say that safely.
[17:36.620 --> 17:40.540]  If I get a clone from somebody, no matter where it came from, I will treat it with a
[17:40.540 --> 17:47.140]  pesticide that is not allowed in a commercial grow because, uh, that is my, my way of protecting
[17:47.140 --> 17:48.140]  myself.
[17:48.140 --> 17:51.620]  I've seen a lot of people treat those incoming plants with a really, a strong pesticide that
[17:51.620 --> 17:53.860]  I wouldn't recommend unless it's an incoming plant.
[17:53.860 --> 17:58.260]  That's the only reason I have this pesticide is people say, I don't have bugs and people
[17:58.260 --> 18:00.780]  like to say that they don't have diseases, but guess what?
[18:00.780 --> 18:03.560]  Not everybody knows that they got a disease or a bug.
[18:03.560 --> 18:06.020]  So when I get a plant, I treat it with some crazy shit.
[18:06.020 --> 18:07.020]  I've learned my lesson.
[18:07.020 --> 18:11.540]  I got spider mites from somebody, uh, no names to be said here, but somebody sent me a clone
[18:11.540 --> 18:15.580]  that had the most ferocious fucking spider mites I've ever seen.
[18:15.580 --> 18:18.660]  It slowed me down honestly for a full year.
[18:18.660 --> 18:21.300]  These spider mites, they would not go away.
[18:21.300 --> 18:23.660]  I needed a solid Colorado winter.
[18:23.660 --> 18:28.220]  I was sucking in cold air from the negative 17 outside, blowing it into the bedroom.
[18:28.220 --> 18:30.980]  The plants look like shit, but eventually the spider mites died.
[18:30.980 --> 18:33.580]  I kept treating for them anyway.
[18:33.580 --> 18:35.220]  I don't want to get that problem again.
[18:35.220 --> 18:40.000]  So I treat very heavily when plants come in to prevent problems.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.820]  You couldn't do what I do in a commercial grow because the products that I'm applying
[18:43.820 --> 18:45.340]  are actually banned.
[18:46.100 --> 18:50.500]  I say that I try to grow from my heart, breed with love and treat these plants with a lot
[18:50.500 --> 18:55.700]  of love, but that is my preventative measure to keep my livelihood, my business afloat.
[18:55.700 --> 19:00.380]  If I let spider mites get in here again and ruin a bunch of plants, then that's a bunch
[19:00.380 --> 19:02.060]  of seeds you guys don't get to grow.
[19:02.060 --> 19:04.500]  That's a bunch of herb that Mike and I don't get to smoke.
[19:04.500 --> 19:06.180]  So I've got to prevent that sort of stuff.
[19:06.180 --> 19:09.980]  Now let's get back to, um, the commercial girls can't use that stuff.
[19:09.980 --> 19:11.160]  I can use that stuff.
[19:11.160 --> 19:15.020]  So that's one of the main differences is the amount of people that come and go and the
[19:15.060 --> 19:17.500]  products which we are allowed to use.
[19:17.500 --> 19:19.900]  Also I was talking about the funding and the budget.
[19:19.900 --> 19:24.180]  If my crop goes away, that's a couple of lights at six plants, not a big deal.
[19:24.180 --> 19:25.180]  Bye bye.
[19:25.180 --> 19:31.060]  And a commercial grow, we've got hundreds, maybe thousands of plants in one area.
[19:31.060 --> 19:36.740]  And if you get a problem over here in this tray, there are fans, there are people walking
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.740]  around.
[19:37.740 --> 19:39.840]  The shit is going to move around very quickly.
[19:39.840 --> 19:45.160]  If one room gets contaminated, if one table gets an infestation of bugs, it's going to
[19:45.160 --> 19:46.600]  move around with the fans.
[19:46.600 --> 19:50.240]  The spider mites climb up to the tops of the plants and they feel the wind and they go,
[19:50.240 --> 19:51.400]  Oh, there's a breeze.
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.800]  And they put out a little web and they jump and they have a leap of faith and they draw
[19:54.800 --> 19:58.560]  that that web with them and wherever they land, that's where they build the new web
[19:58.560 --> 20:02.280]  to and they just make that leap of faith and they use the fan to blow themselves around
[20:02.280 --> 20:03.280]  and travel.
[20:03.280 --> 20:06.320]  Also they use the grow techs and the growers to travel around.
[20:06.320 --> 20:09.480]  They're jumping on your, if you're wearing scrubs, they jump on your scrubs.
[20:09.480 --> 20:13.320]  If you're wearing a t-shirt, they jump on your t-shirt, they move around the grow with
[20:13.320 --> 20:14.320]  that stuff.
[20:14.320 --> 20:16.260]  So we're spreading them around the grow.
[20:16.260 --> 20:22.000]  If we get one small area infected, infested with bugs, it moves very, very quickly.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.880]  So my order of operations is not just different, but it's more, a very more strict and very
[20:27.880 --> 20:30.560]  more stringent in a commercial environment.
[20:30.560 --> 20:35.280]  One thing I should loop back around in my personal grow, it's personal.
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.360]  Nobody goes there.
[20:36.360 --> 20:37.360]  You're not invited.
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.360]  Get the fuck out.
[20:38.360 --> 20:39.440]  You're not come there.
[20:39.440 --> 20:41.080]  I don't bring contractors there.
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.640]  I don't bring inspectors there.
[20:42.640 --> 20:44.520]  There are no investors there.
[20:44.520 --> 20:46.640]  I don't even, nobody gets to see that shit.
[20:46.640 --> 20:50.360]  Mike hasn't even seen the grow in weeks and months and Clint hasn't seen it.
[20:50.360 --> 20:53.400]  My girlfriend actually had to ask, can I see a couple of your plants?
[20:53.400 --> 20:56.840]  I had to, she had to like ask for permission to actually get to see the shit.
[20:56.840 --> 20:58.040]  I don't take anybody in there.
[20:58.040 --> 21:00.360]  That's not, that is my space.
[21:00.360 --> 21:02.320]  I share a lot of stuff on the internet.
[21:02.320 --> 21:04.280]  I share a lot of my life on the internet.
[21:04.280 --> 21:06.200]  My podcast is all over the place.
[21:06.200 --> 21:09.040]  I'm on Instagram all the time doing Instagram live shit.
[21:09.040 --> 21:11.280]  I'm on discord hanging out with my friends.
[21:11.280 --> 21:14.440]  My grow space is my little Zen area.
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.440]  That is my space.
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.840]  I don't take people in there.
[21:16.840 --> 21:17.840]  You can't judge me.
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.320]  You can't disrupt me.
[21:19.320 --> 21:20.440]  You can't learn my tricks.
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.760]  You can't steal my secrets.
[21:21.760 --> 21:27.480]  That is my little 10 by 10 area of leave me alone.
[21:27.480 --> 21:29.080]  You can't change the music in there.
[21:29.080 --> 21:31.200]  You can't turn down the fan.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.200]  Don't touch it.
[21:32.200 --> 21:33.200]  You're not invited.
[21:33.200 --> 21:34.200]  I know it sounds rude, right?
[21:34.200 --> 21:35.200]  It's cool.
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.680]  You're allowed to do that with your space.
[21:36.680 --> 21:37.680]  It's mine.
[21:37.680 --> 21:38.680]  It's yours.
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  You do what you want.
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.680]  I'm going to do what I want.
[21:40.680 --> 21:41.680]  I love it.
[21:41.680 --> 21:42.680]  So that is my grow space.
[21:42.680 --> 21:43.680]  Nobody gets to go in there but me.
[21:43.680 --> 21:45.040]  I definitely don't have any pets down there.
[21:45.040 --> 21:47.160]  No dogs get to go up there.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.360]  That is just my grow space.
[21:48.360 --> 21:51.840]  So what I've got to do for preventative is much less.
[21:51.840 --> 21:57.240]  When I get home, if I'm going to the grow space, I simply drop the clothes that I'm wearing
[21:57.240 --> 22:00.040]  in from the shoes, the socks, the pants.
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.840]  I leave the same undies if you want to visualize that.
[22:02.840 --> 22:04.200]  The shirt's got to go.
[22:04.200 --> 22:06.240]  The dreads are usually tied up or untied somehow.
[22:06.240 --> 22:08.640]  If I'm going into the grow, I've got a specific hat.
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.640]  Tie the locks up.
[22:09.640 --> 22:11.000]  Put them into the specific hat.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.200]  I wear a couple of outfits that I rotate into the grow.
[22:14.200 --> 22:15.560]  I wash them quite frequently.
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.000]  But I've got specific grow room clothes that I wear in there.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.640]  So I come from wherever I was, basically strip down, put on the grow room clothes, go into
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.640]  the grow.
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.500]  As I come out, before I go into any other room, those grow clothes come off and they
[22:29.500 --> 22:31.440]  get stacked into a little bit of a pile.
[22:31.440 --> 22:33.880]  Sometimes they get thrown in the washer if I saw any problems.
[22:34.560 --> 22:37.240]  A lot of times I'll take a shower before I even go into that grow space.
[22:37.240 --> 22:40.000]  Of course, I got fucking six foot long dreadlocks.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.640]  So it's kind of hard to completely shower before I go into every grow space, but I do
[22:43.640 --> 22:45.200]  my best.
[22:45.200 --> 22:48.960]  Another thing that helps me out is I'm allowed to use different products.
[22:48.960 --> 22:53.560]  So my main standard operating procedures are very different in my personal grow and in
[22:53.560 --> 22:58.320]  commercial grows because the amount of people that are coming and going, the amount of risk
[22:58.320 --> 23:02.120]  that is involved, the options that we've got for mitigating problems.
[23:02.120 --> 23:07.960]  If I see a problem in my grow, I can blast it with whatever I want that I feel ethical
[23:07.960 --> 23:08.960]  doing so.
[23:08.960 --> 23:11.880]  Also keep in mind, people aren't going to smoke 90% of what I grow.
[23:11.880 --> 23:13.480]  Most of what I grow is seeded.
[23:13.480 --> 23:16.760]  So technically I could, I don't, don't get me, don't think I'm doing this, but I could
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.120]  spray it with everything because you're not going to smoke it.
[23:20.120 --> 23:23.240]  That's the reason we worry about spraying our plants mostly is because we don't want
[23:23.240 --> 23:25.680]  people smoking contaminated shit.
[23:25.680 --> 23:26.920]  You're not going to smoke it, bro.
[23:26.920 --> 23:30.840]  It's all going to be seeds, which I'm just hypothetically saying I could treat it with
[23:30.840 --> 23:32.020]  all kinds of shit.
[23:32.020 --> 23:34.060]  We can't do that in a commercial grow.
[23:34.060 --> 23:39.220]  So order of importance, um, it's similar order of importance.
[23:39.220 --> 23:44.340]  Keep the plants healthy, keep them bug free, have an integrated pest management strategy,
[23:44.340 --> 23:46.340]  and then grow from your heart, breed with love.
[23:46.340 --> 23:52.540]  The order of importance is the same, but the, uh, the way the operation, the procedures
[23:52.540 --> 23:56.220]  change a little bit because like I said, we've got so many people coming and going at the
[23:56.220 --> 23:59.900]  commercial grows that we've got to do a little bit of stuff differently.
[23:59.900 --> 24:04.340]  And it says, is there an order in which you enter and exit your grow areas?
[24:04.340 --> 24:06.660]  That's a very good question.
[24:06.660 --> 24:12.020]  One thing that I do in a commercial environment, um, if I am the boss, which most of the time,
[24:12.020 --> 24:13.540]  not to sound egotistical, I'm the boss.
[24:13.540 --> 24:15.900]  I'm the guy directing the grow team.
[24:15.900 --> 24:20.860]  I like to learn what each grower is good at and what each grower is not good at.
[24:20.860 --> 24:24.340]  Let's just hypothetically talk about my friends, Elijah and Brian.
[24:24.340 --> 24:27.260]  Elijah is five foot something.
[24:27.260 --> 24:29.620]  Brian is six foot something.
[24:29.620 --> 24:32.980]  Why would I have Brian do the shit on the bottom and Elijah do the shit on the top?
[24:32.980 --> 24:35.060]  I've learned that Brian can do the tall stuff.
[24:35.060 --> 24:37.260]  Elijah can do the lower stuff.
[24:37.260 --> 24:41.500]  So it's my job as the kind of the boss, the director of cultivation, the guy in charge
[24:41.500 --> 24:42.500]  of the crew.
[24:42.500 --> 24:43.860]  I find who is good at what.
[24:43.860 --> 24:45.340]  That's one of the things I really like to do.
[24:45.340 --> 24:47.660]  I know that Cletus likes to be outside a lot.
[24:47.660 --> 24:51.420]  So if there's a job that goes outside, Cletus gets that job immediately.
[24:51.420 --> 24:54.260]  I know that some of the growers, they want to be inside all the time.
[24:54.260 --> 24:56.460]  So if there's a job that goes outside, don't make him do it.
[24:56.460 --> 24:58.100]  It'll get done half ass.
[24:58.100 --> 24:59.900]  That's something that I try to learn.
[24:59.900 --> 25:03.820]  Now something that I keep in mind when I'm assigning tasks for the start of the day is
[25:03.820 --> 25:09.180]  I put a person in a room and I try to leave, we were doing Elijah and Brian and Cletus.
[25:09.180 --> 25:14.620]  If I've got rooms A, B and C, I will try to put Brian in room A all day so that he doesn't
[25:14.620 --> 25:18.100]  have to come out of room A and fuck up room B. He doesn't bring the problems from room
[25:18.100 --> 25:20.540]  A to room B. That is something that I would do.
[25:20.540 --> 25:24.100]  Elijah would get room C. Cletus would get room, however I did it.
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.620]  We'd give the guys an individual room or the ladies too.
[25:26.620 --> 25:28.020]  We've got plenty of ladies in the grow.
[25:28.060 --> 25:31.220]  I just say guys all the time because it's just what I fucking say, dude.
[25:31.220 --> 25:36.700]  So we let the guys and gals have individual rooms or I'll put three or four guys or gals
[25:36.700 --> 25:40.780]  in one room and just make them stick in that room so they're not moving the problems around.
[25:40.780 --> 25:42.900]  That's one way that I really focus on it.
[25:42.900 --> 25:45.560]  Then you asked about an order of workflow.
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.540]  In my personal grow, I tend to check on the clones first and most often because they're
[25:51.540 --> 25:53.020]  kind of, they're critical.
[25:53.020 --> 25:54.140]  They are in triage.
[25:54.140 --> 25:55.140]  They're in ICU.
[25:55.140 --> 25:56.140]  The clones are not alive.
[25:56.140 --> 25:57.740]  They need a lot of attention.
[25:57.740 --> 26:01.060]  If that dome gets bumped a little bit and the humidity comes out, we're fucked.
[26:01.060 --> 26:02.500]  All your clones are going to die.
[26:02.500 --> 26:07.860]  So I check those as often as possible, kind of OCD as frequently as I can.
[26:07.860 --> 26:11.680]  Then the smaller plants are probably going to dry up the soonest.
[26:11.680 --> 26:13.820]  So I check those next.
[26:13.820 --> 26:17.460]  Then I'm in the veg area so now I will check the bigger veg plants.
[26:17.460 --> 26:18.980]  I'll check those next.
[26:18.980 --> 26:20.540]  Then of course the mother plants are in there.
[26:20.540 --> 26:21.940]  I would check the mother plants next.
[26:21.940 --> 26:26.100]  I got the clones, the veg, the moms all in one area.
[26:26.100 --> 26:28.420]  So I make sure that those are cool.
[26:28.420 --> 26:30.540]  Then we would check the flowering space after that.
[26:30.540 --> 26:35.500]  But I basically start from the starters all the way up to the enders because my thought
[26:35.500 --> 26:37.860]  process is I need healthy starts.
[26:37.860 --> 26:43.100]  If they're already infested, infected, contaminated at the end, they're almost done.
[26:43.100 --> 26:44.100]  I can't save them.
[26:44.100 --> 26:45.100]  I just got to get them.
[26:45.100 --> 26:46.360]  I got to ride them out.
[26:46.360 --> 26:48.900]  But I need healthy shit for my next run always.
[26:48.900 --> 26:53.520]  I need healthy moms, healthy clones, healthy veg, or I cannot have a strong flower.
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.280]  So I focus mostly my order of operations honestly in the commercial grow and the home
[26:58.280 --> 26:59.280]  grow.
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.200]  I focus on the littles and I work my way up all the way to the end of the day.
[27:04.200 --> 27:09.400]  We're checking on burping the jars and harvesting and that's a whole other fucking conversation.
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.040]  Then it says does your mother room have a specialty entrance or exit plan?
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.280]  Without revealing too much info, the home grow is a home grow.
[27:17.280 --> 27:19.500]  It's got a bedroom door on it, bro.
[27:19.500 --> 27:21.960]  It's got a lock and a key and a bedroom fucking door.
[27:21.960 --> 27:23.240]  No special grow.
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.800]  The windows are covered so nothing can get in and out.
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.240]  I put two great words together, one of my favorite products.
[27:30.240 --> 27:34.880]  I use Gorilla Kalk to seal all the cracks and then put tape over that as well.
[27:34.880 --> 27:38.720]  So nothing's getting in and out of there unless it goes under the door or through the air
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.440]  ducts, which I have created.
[27:40.440 --> 27:44.160]  I use the air underneath the door for passive air intake.
[27:44.160 --> 27:46.840]  Let me read more of this question because I got rambling really well.
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.560]  I'm not even sure that I've answered the question, but I've talked a lot.
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.360]  So you guys asked for longer shows.
[27:51.360 --> 27:53.000]  You'll fucking get it today.
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.080]  Personal order of importance in your grow.
[27:55.080 --> 27:57.960]  I go personal order of importance.
[27:57.960 --> 28:03.840]  I don't know if I did my flow chart, but order of importance is like clean, healthy plants.
[28:03.840 --> 28:04.840]  Does all the gear work?
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.280]  One of the first things I do when I walk into a commercial grow is I make sure that everything
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.600]  is working.
[28:10.600 --> 28:12.400]  We haven't been there for 12 hours.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.400]  Did anything break?
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.600]  I teach the new people.
[28:14.600 --> 28:17.760]  I always say, all right, now we got to go find out what went wrong last night.
[28:17.760 --> 28:18.760]  And they're like, what?
[28:18.760 --> 28:20.040]  I'm like, oh, something broke last night.
[28:20.040 --> 28:21.040]  A timer died.
[28:21.040 --> 28:22.360]  A pump failed.
[28:22.360 --> 28:23.920]  Something fucking shorted out.
[28:23.920 --> 28:25.480]  Something somewhere broke last night.
[28:25.480 --> 28:26.840]  We got to go find that.
[28:26.840 --> 28:31.680]  So order of importance, check the gear, check the plants, smallest to largest.
[28:31.680 --> 28:33.960]  Then do, I scout a lot.
[28:33.960 --> 28:37.600]  When I come back from lunch, probably because I'm blazed, I just fucking took fat dabs at
[28:37.600 --> 28:38.600]  lunch.
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.000]  I like to just cruise and look for bugs.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.520]  Just go cruise a room, send the guys in the rooms, just go, guys and girls, just go scout
[28:44.520 --> 28:45.760]  for bugs right after lunch.
[28:45.760 --> 28:47.160]  Go see if you see anything.
[28:47.160 --> 28:48.520]  And if you do, report back.
[28:48.520 --> 28:50.840]  If not, get back to work, business as usual.
[28:50.840 --> 28:55.760]  So order of importance, I talked about doing the small plants up to the biggest plants.
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.160]  Doesn't really change at home on order which I enter or exit the grows.
[29:01.160 --> 29:06.180]  Since my home grow is basically two small rooms, so nah, there's no, if there's something
[29:06.180 --> 29:09.040]  in that space, it got in both spaces probably.
[29:09.040 --> 29:12.140]  But I do the veg stuff, then I do the flower stuff.
[29:12.140 --> 29:14.920]  Then you ask about how I prevent from moving problems around.
[29:14.920 --> 29:19.240]  Basically in a commercial grow, the way that I do that is I try to keep people in specific
[29:19.640 --> 29:21.520]  rooms when we go to lunch, when we go to break.
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.760]  I try to remind the guys to take off their, if they're wearing a jacket or a hoodie or
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.120]  something, I try to have a special shirt, special shoes and stuff for each grow.
[29:30.120 --> 29:36.020]  Sometimes it's hard to implement certain SOPs at some grows when I'm not fully 100% in charge.
[29:36.020 --> 29:41.640]  They will take my advice and my guidance, but they won't always take everything as instruction.
[29:41.640 --> 29:44.800]  Does my mother room have a special entrance and exit?
[29:44.800 --> 29:48.760]  And the commercial grows, we like to get those things you can step on the floor mats.
[29:48.760 --> 29:50.760]  It's got pesticides inside of it.
[29:50.760 --> 29:53.720]  You stomp around on it, it will kill all the shit on your shoes.
[29:53.720 --> 29:57.120]  In some places we use booties, just little shoe covers.
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.960]  A lot of places we do use a hairnet and a beard net.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.000]  A lot of places we do scrubs.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.920]  A lot of places, honestly, bro, we walk in and out of everything in our regular fucking
[30:05.920 --> 30:06.920]  clothes.
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.360]  It just depends on which facility and what the owner agrees with.
[30:09.360 --> 30:14.080]  I make suggestions, the owner kind of makes the final move.
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.080]  It does go on.
[30:15.080 --> 30:17.240]  It says, I have a shared mom and veg room.
[30:17.240 --> 30:20.400]  What can I do to help keep my mom plants safe?
[30:20.400 --> 30:22.240]  That is a very good question.
[30:22.240 --> 30:25.840]  We've been talking about viruses lately.
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.880]  If you go from your veg plants to your mother plants, consider dunking your scissors in
[30:30.880 --> 30:34.960]  bleach and cleaning those scissors before you go cutting on your mother plants.
[30:34.960 --> 30:38.480]  That way if you do, and if you've got the viroid, it's probably in the mother plant,
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.000]  but if you don't want to move it around, perhaps maybe it would help you.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.800]  Cleanliness is the key.
[30:43.800 --> 30:45.180]  That's what I would recommend.
[30:45.180 --> 30:48.180]  I have a shared mom, clone, veg space as well.
[30:48.180 --> 30:50.100]  I think you'll be just fine with that setup.
[30:50.100 --> 30:54.340]  Then it says, I like starting in the veg mom room, closing everything up and moving on
[30:54.340 --> 30:55.580]  to the flower room.
[30:55.580 --> 30:58.260]  Have you ever worked backwards?
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.580]  I've done it backwards.
[30:59.580 --> 31:01.020]  I've done it forward.
[31:01.020 --> 31:05.460]  As long as you're clean and paying attention and not moving problems around, that's what
[31:05.460 --> 31:06.460]  matters.
[31:06.460 --> 31:09.940]  As long as you've got a strategy, a standard operating procedure that works for you, that's
[31:09.940 --> 31:11.580]  the most important part.
[31:11.580 --> 31:18.100]  One of my favorite things of growing cannabis is that my way works and it could be totally
[31:18.100 --> 31:19.820]  different than your way.
[31:19.820 --> 31:21.100]  Your way is not wrong.
[31:21.100 --> 31:26.660]  As long as at the end of it, we're both sitting here at the table smoking a bowl and we go,
[31:26.660 --> 31:27.660]  I'm satisfied.
[31:27.660 --> 31:29.180]  That's what fucking matters.
[31:29.180 --> 31:32.860]  As long as you're satisfied with the weed you grew, I'm satisfied with the weed that
[31:32.860 --> 31:35.100]  I grew, we didn't do it wrong.
[31:35.100 --> 31:38.260]  The only way you really do it wrong is if the plant died, then you obviously did it
[31:38.260 --> 31:39.260]  wrong.
[31:39.260 --> 31:41.620]  If you burned some shit down, you did it wrong.
[31:41.620 --> 31:46.940]  If you get somebody sick by using a pesticide improperly, you did it wrong.
[31:46.940 --> 31:50.100]  I'd like to say if you go to jail, you did it wrong, but that might not even been part
[31:50.100 --> 31:51.100]  of the case.
[31:51.100 --> 31:53.220]  That might've just been some fuckery there for you.
[31:53.220 --> 31:56.940]  But if you're smoking weed and you're happy with the way that it came out, you're not
[31:56.940 --> 31:57.940]  doing it wrong.
[31:57.940 --> 31:59.980]  There may be things I do differently.
[31:59.980 --> 32:03.740]  There may be things I wouldn't do, or maybe things that I would do in your garden.
[32:03.740 --> 32:07.620]  But as long as you've got an outcome that you're smoking, you're not doing it wrong.
[32:07.620 --> 32:09.460]  There are a thousand ways to skin a cat.
[32:09.460 --> 32:12.860]  There are probably a thousand ways to grow a plant.
[32:12.860 --> 32:13.860]  That's the beauty of it.
[32:13.860 --> 32:14.860]  That's why I love it.
[32:14.860 --> 32:16.060]  That's part of what I love about cannabis.
[32:16.060 --> 32:17.460]  I can do it my way.
[32:17.460 --> 32:18.460]  I've been doing it my way.
[32:18.460 --> 32:22.700]  I've been establishing, developing, and I don't want to say perfecting, but honing my
[32:22.700 --> 32:26.900]  way for several years now to the ability, to the effect, to the level where I feel like
[32:26.900 --> 32:32.860]  I can teach you guys to follow my standard operating procedure and have great success.
[32:32.860 --> 32:36.260]  But I also encourage you to do it your way.
[32:36.260 --> 32:38.260]  Your grow is not the same as mine.
[32:38.260 --> 32:40.260]  Your lights are not the same as mine.
[32:40.260 --> 32:42.140]  Your plants aren't the same as mine.
[32:42.140 --> 32:44.180]  You may have an astronomical fucking budget.
[32:44.180 --> 32:47.260]  You could buy all those new lights that came out last week that I've been looking at going,
[32:47.260 --> 32:49.140]  when do they come out with this one?
[32:49.140 --> 32:50.580]  You may not have any budget at all.
[32:50.580 --> 32:55.180]  You may be duct taping fucking old street lamps to the ceiling to make that work.
[32:55.180 --> 32:56.460]  We've all got a different setup.
[32:56.460 --> 32:57.700]  We've all got the same goal.
[32:57.700 --> 33:02.380]  Our goal is to grow the best herb that we can so that whenever we hang out, whenever
[33:02.380 --> 33:07.020]  we don't feel right, whenever we want to feel better, we can smoke the best herb that
[33:07.020 --> 33:11.900]  is available and we can produce it ourselves and not have to rely on anybody else.
[33:11.900 --> 33:12.900]  All right.
[33:12.900 --> 33:14.660]  I think I got rambling pretty good there.
[33:14.660 --> 33:17.260]  I am not sure how long I've been recording.
[33:17.260 --> 33:18.980]  We're going to call this a podcast, everybody.
[33:18.980 --> 33:20.460]  I want to thank you for listening.
[33:20.460 --> 33:22.020]  I had a good time recording this show.
[33:22.020 --> 33:23.980]  I hope you had as good of a time as I do.
[33:23.980 --> 33:29.460]  I look forward to your feedback, your constructive criticism, your positive words of affirmation,
[33:29.460 --> 33:31.900]  or if you want to tell me there's something to correct.
[33:31.940 --> 33:32.940]  I look forward to it.
[33:32.940 --> 33:36.860]  The email address, of course, is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[33:36.860 --> 33:37.860]  Don't be shy.
[33:37.860 --> 33:38.860]  Send me that feedback.
[33:38.860 --> 33:39.860]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[33:39.860 --> 33:46.180]  Of course, do not forget about the Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.

[33:59.540 --> 34:02.300]  We do some crazy deals on that site.
[34:02.300 --> 34:03.300]  Stay tuned.
[34:03.300 --> 34:05.300]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[34:05.300 --> 34:08.020]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[34:08.020 --> 34:11.300]  I want to give a big shout out to Ben the Web Guy.
[34:11.300 --> 34:14.580]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
