[00:01.850 --> 00:05.390]  Yo what up podcast world it's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you with another
[00:05.390 --> 00:10.730]  throwback Thursday episode. This time I'm doing episodes 42, 43, and 44 of what
[00:10.730 --> 00:14.070]  used to be known as the I Grow Culture podcast, currently known as the Grow
[00:14.070 --> 00:18.210]  From Your Heart podcast. Before we get into this block of old episodes let me
[00:18.210 --> 00:22.310]  make a couple of updates and disclaimers. All of the social media has changed. The
[00:22.310 --> 00:26.930]  new email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. On Twitter you can find
[00:26.930 --> 00:31.330]  us under at GFYH podcast and on Facebook simply search for the Grow From Your
[00:31.330 --> 00:36.090]  Heart podcast. Also any advertisements, giveaways, or contests that are mentioned
[00:36.090 --> 00:39.970]  in these old episodes those all have expired in past so don't get too excited.
[00:39.970 --> 00:44.110]  And also let me say one more thing. A lot of my methods, techniques, and ideas have
[00:44.110 --> 00:48.910]  changed in the past three years and 210 episodes. If I say something in these old
[00:48.910 --> 00:53.010]  episodes that I contradict in a current episode, go with the most current episode.
[00:53.010 --> 00:57.170]  I've learned a lot in 200 episodes and I hope you have also. So with no further
[00:57.250 --> 01:01.690]  ado ladies and gentlemen here's episodes 42, 43, and 44 of what used to be known
[01:01.690 --> 01:19.370]  as the I Grow Culture podcast now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:19.370 --> 01:23.490]  Yeah what's up ladies and gentlemen it's time for episode number 42 of the I Grow
[01:23.490 --> 01:27.650]  Culture podcast. They call me Rasta Jeff. Dude joining me at the table tonight we
[01:27.650 --> 01:30.770]  have a brand new guest who's never been on the show. What's up Tony how you doing?
[01:30.770 --> 01:34.230]  I'm good how are you? I am great bro. I'm gonna turn down the music a little bit
[01:34.230 --> 01:38.130]  we'll talk. Tony is the dude that built my website. He built the iRegenetics
[01:38.130 --> 01:42.450]  website. Tony is responsible for getting the feed up that hosts the I Grow
[01:42.450 --> 01:45.850]  Culture podcast so dude big huge shout out you don't get the credit you deserve.
[01:45.850 --> 01:52.610]  Thanks a lot. Gosh excuse me while I cough out a lung. And as usual well not
[01:52.610 --> 01:56.250]  usual as often I guess our good buddy Jesse is back. How you doing bro? Pretty
[01:56.250 --> 02:00.290]  good. Thanks for coming. How's it going podcast land? Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving? Oh yeah.
[02:00.290 --> 02:03.850]  Yeah. Oh yeah I imagine you did. Tony's got an Italian family so I could imagine
[02:04.010 --> 02:08.570]  how much you guys ate. Yeah. No headphones for you? Sometimes this thing cuts out
[02:08.570 --> 02:12.770]  bro I apologize it's this headphone jack here. Did it come back? Yeah. Cool cool.
[02:12.770 --> 02:15.890]  Yeah once in a while it'll just fart out on you just give me that same where the
[02:15.890 --> 02:19.090]  fuck are my headphones signal and we'll correct it. Yeah I don't have it right
[02:19.090 --> 02:24.850]  now either. Oh we'll keep going. You back? Yeah. Nice. Cool cool. How was your
[02:24.850 --> 02:28.050]  Thanksgiving bro? I almost skipped you. It's pretty good. Good good. I have the
[02:28.050 --> 02:32.290]  privilege of going to four Thanksgiving dinners. Nice. Yeah. I had two
[02:32.290 --> 02:35.890]  Thanksgiving dinners incidentally. Shout out to my Aunt Lisa. She made a huge
[02:35.890 --> 02:38.490]  Thanksgiving dinner for the whole family. That's really super cool of you. I
[02:38.490 --> 02:43.650]  appreciate it. It was tasty. I'm a vegetarian so she was really nice and
[02:43.650 --> 02:47.330]  made some things differently than she would have. She didn't put beef broth and
[02:47.330 --> 02:51.010]  bacon and some shit you know so I had a lot of options to eat. Also huge shout
[02:51.010 --> 02:55.290]  out to Angela. Angela doesn't have any family here in Colorado so I totally
[02:55.290 --> 02:58.090]  invited her to come eat dinner with my family and I and she had a great time.
[02:58.090 --> 03:01.330]  Nice. She was totally cool. My family loved her so thanks for coming. I really
[03:01.330 --> 03:05.330]  appreciate that Angela. I hope all the listeners had a good Thanksgiving or if
[03:05.330 --> 03:08.810]  you're not into that then I hope you had a great Thursday and a good weekend. Some
[03:08.810 --> 03:13.690]  people hate Thanksgiving. I don't. I'm impartial and I go eat with the family
[03:13.690 --> 03:17.290]  to be to be social like we should. I think it's one of the better holidays.
[03:17.290 --> 03:23.050]  There's a you know it's just well at its core it's one of the better holidays.
[03:23.050 --> 03:27.770]  What about 420 bro? Oh yeah that's awesome holiday. That's like Christmas for the potheads.
[03:27.770 --> 03:31.050]  Yeah. All right. Let's see do I have any other stuff we got to do? Let's get to
[03:31.050 --> 03:33.690]  some ads real quick so we can get right down to business. On this episode I do
[03:33.690 --> 03:38.330]  plan on doing a little lesson on nutrients and stuff and I also have a
[03:38.330 --> 03:43.250]  good question for my buddy Tony. Tony is a he's an organic chemistry student. How
[03:43.250 --> 03:49.370]  far are you from your degree bro? About five ten credit hours. Okay I don't go to
[03:49.370 --> 03:54.650]  college so what does that mean for humans? A semester. A semester. Cool. Tony's a new
[03:54.650 --> 04:00.570]  father so he's distracted from school. Congrats on that. He hasn't been around
[04:00.570 --> 04:04.770]  as much so I'm sure he's not at school as much. Turn down that music. I'm trying
[04:04.770 --> 04:07.850]  to yell over it. It feels way better. So we'll have Tony talk about a couple
[04:07.850 --> 04:11.690]  things here in a minute. Before we can get that far this podcast is brought to

[05:46.610 --> 05:50.610]  looking sweet. I can't wait to get my hands on a couple. If you're listening I
[05:50.610 --> 05:56.810]  like the ones with stars and I like red gold and green stuff but anyway. I've got
[05:56.810 --> 06:01.050]  the coughs from some dabs. This podcast you're gonna cough too? Do it. I'll turn
[06:01.050 --> 06:04.370]  your mic off. Those dabs were killer. Yeah they were kind of bigger than what we
[06:04.370 --> 06:07.930]  should have taken right before a show. That was heavy duty. We wanted to get it
[06:07.930 --> 06:11.410]  done and get to the show. If you take two dabs that are really big you just move on.
[06:11.410 --> 06:15.010]  You don't have to sit there and dab out all day. That's what I think. Big love to
[06:15.010 --> 06:17.690]  TreeThugger.com. This episode is brought to you in part by our good friends at

[06:33.170 --> 06:36.650]  really appreciate you guys helping us out. Also a big shout out to Coot Dog and
[06:36.650 --> 06:39.770]  Catherine of the Mystic Roots Band. They let me play all of their music on the
[06:39.770 --> 06:44.290]  podcast. How cool is that? Can't go much cooler than that. I want to give a big
[06:44.290 --> 06:46.570]  shout out to Spence and Maddie. They came over the other night and helped me do a
[06:46.570 --> 06:50.210]  chore. I wish you guys great luck with the Secret Cup that you're headed to. I
[06:50.210 --> 06:54.010]  hope you guys bring home a trophy and a whole bunch of prizes and a new rig. I
[06:54.010 --> 06:57.930]  want to dab out of your new rig on the podcast next week. That'll be super
[06:57.930 --> 07:02.730]  awesome. And get the respect that you totally deserve and are worthy of. Did you
[07:02.730 --> 07:06.130]  hear that? I didn't say that. I didn't say that. That was my homie Jesse. I butter
[07:06.130 --> 07:10.810]  him up a lot but Jesse just said you guys deserve respect. I agree. Also a big
[07:10.810 --> 07:13.450]  shout out to Laz. I don't know if you listen to the show but I met a dude named
[07:13.450 --> 07:16.770]  Laz recently. We finally met in person. We've been online buddies. We got to hang
[07:16.770 --> 07:21.410]  out. Cool ass dude. Shout out. Also last shout out for a minute Mr. Omnio. What's
[07:21.410 --> 07:24.410]  up bro? You're finally caught up on episodes. It's like we're hanging out in
[07:24.410 --> 07:28.650]  his kitchen. He left a tweet that says I'm listening while I'm making
[07:28.650 --> 07:32.730]  beef bouillon and it's like they're hanging out in my kitchen. So dude we
[07:32.730 --> 07:35.650]  record this show about 10 feet from my kitchen so that could have been a
[07:35.650 --> 07:40.450]  reality almost. It's kind of you were almost there. Come cook for us. No. Come cook.
[07:40.450 --> 07:44.450]  Yeah. Yeah. Come cook for us. Anybody can come cook for us. I'm a strict vegetarian.
[07:44.450 --> 07:49.650]  Jesse will eat almost anything. Tony, you cool? Anything man. Anything? Alright. Come cook for us
[07:49.650 --> 07:53.570]  guys. You could be the agriculture chef. Alright. I've got a couple topics written
[07:53.570 --> 07:58.610]  down. One of them, this just came up. I was kind of rude to somebody the other
[07:58.610 --> 08:03.690]  day. I realized that they were selling their plants, their crop got powdery
[08:03.690 --> 08:08.930]  mildew and instead of salvaging it, they decided to cut the crop down and make
[08:08.930 --> 08:12.290]  live resin out of it and I would not have known about it unless somebody else
[08:12.290 --> 08:18.770]  told me that they were doing that and so I called him out on it and I said you
[08:18.770 --> 08:22.290]  are the difference between being a caregiver and a cash cropper. You were
[08:22.290 --> 08:25.330]  the person that's gonna make somebody sick because we shouldn't be giving
[08:25.330 --> 08:31.130]  tainted medicine to people who already have a compromised immune system. Other
[08:31.170 --> 08:34.970]  people in the room treated me like I was kind of going overboard but I felt it
[08:34.970 --> 08:39.410]  was kind of my responsibility to call this dude out and let him know that he's
[08:39.410 --> 08:42.970]  really doing it wrong and he's making us all look bad. You know, he's not helping
[08:42.970 --> 08:46.330]  the movement at all and that's not what I'm working towards. So I wanted to have
[08:46.330 --> 08:50.530]  a little bit of backup when I approach this dude saying this is why. So that's
[08:50.530 --> 08:52.810]  why I brought Tony on the show. Like I was saying earlier, Tony is an organic
[08:52.810 --> 08:56.370]  chemistry student and he knows a lot about this. So I guess the simple
[08:56.370 --> 09:01.290]  question I want to ask, once again excuse my dab throat, if we take these
[09:01.290 --> 09:05.610]  powdery mildew buds and we blast them with butane, are we gonna get powdery
[09:05.610 --> 09:08.850]  mildew or what is happening? Can you tell me a little about that? Well you're not
[09:08.850 --> 09:15.210]  gonna get the powdery mildew itself but you'll get the mycotoxins or any sort of
[09:15.210 --> 09:22.930]  toxins that they create which powdery mildew is fairly toxic to humans. Now
[09:22.930 --> 09:26.330]  believe it or not you actually probably be better off smoking the buds yourself
[09:26.850 --> 09:31.770]  not distributing them but it would be less toxic than blasting it and
[09:31.770 --> 09:35.130]  concentrating it. That's why they call them concentrates because we're
[09:35.130 --> 09:42.170]  concentrating everything that's in the plant matter into an oil that is far far
[09:42.170 --> 09:46.330]  far more concentrated than the plant matter itself. I hadn't even thought
[09:46.330 --> 09:50.370]  about that route. You're making powdery mildew dabs just like you are hash.
[09:50.370 --> 09:54.170]  You're taking the mycotoxins and concentrating it. Okay sorry I gotta fix
[09:54.770 --> 10:01.530]  that. I have a question. When you say fairly toxic could you put some kind of
[10:01.530 --> 10:05.130]  comparison on that? Well it's definitely not like black mold or anything like
[10:05.130 --> 10:10.810]  that but I'm sure you guys remember the swag days. Oh yeah. The cheap brick weed.
[10:10.810 --> 10:16.290]  Oh yeah. That stuff had powdery mildew in it very often and even smoking small
[10:16.290 --> 10:21.090]  quantities of that you'd end up with chest congestion, bronchitis usually, sore
[10:21.170 --> 10:25.050]  throat for a week and a half. So you can imagine what happens if you concentrate
[10:25.050 --> 10:30.250]  it 10 to 15 times the dosage. And then you take a big fat dab like I like to do.
[10:30.250 --> 10:34.290]  Oh yeah. So you just probably got a good percentage of mycotoxins in your body.
[10:34.290 --> 10:38.370]  Yeah and the trippy thing about that is it's not gonna show up immediately
[10:38.370 --> 10:42.570]  immediately. It's probably gonna show up in a month or two. The really weird
[10:42.570 --> 10:46.690]  effects. You're probably gonna go like a little nuts from it. A little bit of
[10:46.690 --> 10:50.890]  psychosis in my mind? Behavior change yeah. Paranoia. That's if we smoke a lot
[10:50.890 --> 10:55.330]  right? That's not like from one or two dabs or some PM dabs. It's consistent
[10:55.330 --> 11:00.970]  small doses. Okay. So if you're smoking it once a day for a week or two it's
[11:00.970 --> 11:05.010]  gonna do some weird stuff to you. Alright. Definitely don't want to do that. Makes
[11:05.010 --> 11:09.370]  you think guys. Wonder where your dabs are coming from. And he said this is
[11:09.370 --> 11:12.370]  something that caught my mind. He said it's almost it would be better if you
[11:12.370 --> 11:16.770]  smoke the buds than it would be to smoke the hash. And I also like that you said
[11:16.770 --> 11:20.450]  smoke the damn buds yourself. Don't give them out to anybody. That's what you
[11:20.490 --> 11:23.890]  should do. If you grew powdery mildew buds and you have to do something smoke
[11:23.890 --> 11:27.330]  it yourself. That way you know reap what you sow. That way you're not getting
[11:27.330 --> 11:30.810]  somebody else sick. If you're gonna do it do it. Don't give it to someone else to
[11:30.810 --> 11:35.730]  smoke. Alright. So mycotoxins. You said a little bit of psychosis. Do you think a
[11:35.730 --> 11:40.050]  little bit of headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting? Stuff that would be described
[11:40.050 --> 11:45.370]  as hidden or mistaken as other things? Definitely. Usually flu-like or cold
[11:45.370 --> 11:50.010]  symptoms. And then as it gets later you'll definitely get like typical mold
[11:50.130 --> 11:56.010]  poisoning like seizures and very very very very bad things will happen to you.
[11:56.010 --> 12:01.370]  Kidney and liver toxicity. From mycotoxins right? Oh yeah those those
[12:01.370 --> 12:08.210]  wreak havoc on you. And powdery mildew is it's of that type of organism that's
[12:08.210 --> 12:12.610]  gonna produce those. And it's they don't worry about it for food crops very often
[12:12.610 --> 12:18.210]  because it's only leafy parts that get affected by it. Okay. Most fruits like
[12:18.210 --> 12:22.090]  tomatoes and stuff won't show the little patches on them. So like cucumbers
[12:22.090 --> 12:27.810]  or squash should always get infected? The fruit itself is probably safe? Um yeah to
[12:27.810 --> 12:39.210]  consume. Not to blast into hash. You probably run into the same trouble. Cucumber resin. You get some tarps bro. Yeah and even then that's not
[12:39.210 --> 12:42.890]  very strong quantities because you have to have a large amount of leafy matter
[12:43.010 --> 12:48.410]  infected with the white patches. That's the fruiting body. And then it's it's a
[12:48.410 --> 12:52.330]  toxin that's systemic that goes throughout the plant. So yeah you'll end
[12:52.330 --> 12:56.650]  up with it in your cucumbers or squash or whatever but not much. However we're
[12:56.650 --> 13:02.370]  we're smoking leafy leafy flowers which accumulate that stuff with freakishly
[13:02.370 --> 13:09.250]  high concentrations itself. So it's not the same as a food a food issue. Because
[13:09.330 --> 13:13.290]  it's technically considered non-toxic for food crops even though they don't
[13:13.290 --> 13:16.570]  let it ever happen. But you definitely don't want to be smoking that stuff.
[13:16.570 --> 13:21.250]  We've had it on like you said the leafy parts of plants but we've never actually
[13:21.250 --> 13:37.410]  like I've never actually seen it on the. There you go. You're into the side of the mic like you're some kind of gangster rapper. What was that? Punk rocker. Okay. But I've always you know since powdery mildew
[13:37.410 --> 13:44.370]  kind of came around last few five six years seems like I've wondered about
[13:44.370 --> 13:50.450]  those late season crops that always get infected with that. Yeah. Yeah. I've tended
[13:50.450 --> 13:53.490]  to throw a lot of that stuff in the compost pile. That's probably what you
[13:53.490 --> 13:57.090]  should do. Well I don't know is that powdery mildew gonna affect his compost?
[13:57.090 --> 14:01.450]  Yeah you don't want to actually put that in compost either they say. Yeah. Yeah.
[14:01.450 --> 14:06.570]  It's it's not a good one to have. Okay. Mycotoxin. I figured he got hot enough
[14:06.570 --> 14:10.570]  that. And doesn't kill the spores. No. Okay. And you don't actually have to worry
[14:10.570 --> 14:13.930]  about inhaling the spores. It's that literally the toxins that you're burning
[14:13.930 --> 14:18.210]  are just gonna wreak havoc on your the mucus membranes at first and then it's
[14:18.210 --> 14:23.490]  gonna make you a little weird. I've been I've seen some big commercial rooms that
[14:23.490 --> 14:28.810]  I felt like the spores actually burned my nose. I think I know who you're talking about.
[14:28.810 --> 14:34.570]  Possibly. So this dude told me that using a one micron screen would prevent any of
[14:34.570 --> 14:39.290]  the mycotoxins or spores getting into the hash. That's completely bullshit
[14:39.290 --> 14:43.450]  because he's we're basically juicing the mycotoxins right through that screen.
[14:43.450 --> 14:47.850]  They're in solution so you can't filter them out as if they were solid particles.
[14:47.850 --> 14:53.610]  Just like the THC is correct? Correct. Yeah it's totally same thing as salt and
[14:53.610 --> 14:57.210]  water unless you actually have a filter that you can filter out.
[14:57.210 --> 15:03.290]  It's not even a filter anymore. They call it a semi permeable membrane.
[15:03.290 --> 15:09.050]  That's what osmosis uses. Okay. Yeah that's yeah that's not even a filter anymore.
[15:09.050 --> 15:14.090]  You can't filter a dissolved solid out of a liquid. I like the tone he knows a lot of shit.
[15:14.090 --> 15:19.810]  Yeah sorry it's warm in here. It got hot in here today. Man those tabs got to me.
[15:19.810 --> 15:24.090]  Everyone's a little slow I can tell on the show. All right so basically powdery
[15:24.090 --> 15:27.170]  mildew is fucking terrible you guys. If you've got powdery mildew on your
[15:27.170 --> 15:31.730]  buds don't give that to somebody else. Smoke that yourself if you're going to do anything with it.
[15:31.730 --> 15:36.210]  Don't blast it. Please don't blast it. If you're a medical marijuana provider and you are giving
[15:36.210 --> 15:41.810]  powdery mildew buds to sick people you're the devil. You are anti the movement. You're doing
[15:41.810 --> 15:46.450]  everything wrong. You're making sick people sicker. You're causing more problems than you're helping.
[15:46.450 --> 15:50.370]  You're the difference between a cash cropper and a caregiver. Don't be a cash cropper. Be a
[15:50.370 --> 15:54.930]  caregiver. I'm done with that rant. I'll stop. Also Ryan if you listen to the podcast I kind of
[15:54.930 --> 15:59.650]  went off on you kind of hard about this the other day. I apologize. I try to be a leader of the
[15:59.650 --> 16:04.290]  movement and a lot of people will accept that and I want to speak out about it and make sure that
[16:04.290 --> 16:09.170]  you know how passionately wrong I feel that it is. I might have been rude. I apologize bro. We're
[16:09.170 --> 16:14.370]  still friends. We'll still dab. All right so I promised that we would talk about nutrients. You
[16:14.370 --> 16:18.210]  guys all feel good about the powdery mildew topic? Oh yeah. Thanks for your expertise Tony. Tony will
[16:18.210 --> 16:21.810]  be good at this nutrient part too. Tony's I'm not going to call him a pro level grower. He's got a
[16:21.810 --> 16:27.490]  couple few crops under his belt. He's got that chemistry background so it really helps him out
[16:27.490 --> 16:31.810]  but it also kind of kills him. All right guys we had to take a quick break but we are back. Jesse
[16:31.810 --> 16:36.450]  had to dip out. He well I wish I had a better story for you. He took a dab and turned green
[16:36.450 --> 16:41.890]  so we had to cut out and get Jesse some water and get him to the couch. Right now Jesse is chilling
[16:41.890 --> 16:45.410]  on the couch. He'll be all right. He may come back to the show but I doubt it. He said go on without
[16:45.410 --> 16:50.290]  him so we're going to do that. Insert your make fun of Jesse comments right here. He is a professional
[16:50.290 --> 16:55.410]  but sometimes a dab will get you so he's chilling. Let's do him some love by this way. This podcast
[16:55.410 --> 16:58.690]  is brought to you by our good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor Growing
[16:58.690 --> 17:04.290]  Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store on 6271 Beach Street or

[17:19.330 --> 17:24.290]  Culture Podcast and they will give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase. Tony you can do
[17:24.290 --> 17:28.130]  that too. Tell them I listen to the Hygro Culture Podcast and they'll give you commercial pricing
[17:28.130 --> 17:34.930]  bro. Sweet. That is pretty sweet. I got a $25 bag of dirt for 17 bucks the other day so imagine if
[17:34.930 --> 17:40.530]  I was buying something big. Also a huge shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies for hooking me up
[17:40.530 --> 17:46.130]  with a brand new NanoLux light to test. Big shout out to NanoLux lighting. I can't run it
[17:46.130 --> 17:49.810]  until January because my rooms are full but I really look forward to running that light. It's
[17:49.810 --> 17:53.810]  one of the dual ended light bulbs. I'm sure it's going to put out some lumens. It's going to make
[17:53.810 --> 17:57.570]  my room bright. It's going to make my plants happy. Jesse was giving him praise earlier.
[17:57.570 --> 18:02.450]  He said he set up one light with a room that had an uneven canopy because a lot of times your middle
[18:02.450 --> 18:06.130]  plants will grow better because that's where all the lighting is. He said they evened out within a
[18:06.130 --> 18:11.970]  week or two. So must be doing something right. All right. I said we're going to talk about doing
[18:11.970 --> 18:17.970]  nutrients. I was also mentioning that Tony is a chemistry and organic chemistry major.
[18:18.530 --> 18:21.490]  He's a physics nerd. He's a computer nerd. But this dude knows a lot of stuff.
[18:22.050 --> 18:27.010]  I think that his knowledge of science really helps him when he grows. But I also think it
[18:27.010 --> 18:32.290]  almost kills him when he grows. Plants are predictable but plants aren't science. They're
[18:32.290 --> 18:37.090]  nature. They have limits. Yeah. So I see Tony. He's like, I fed them potassium. Why aren't they
[18:37.090 --> 18:40.930]  potassiuming? Come on, do it. And I'm like, you got to go to bed and you got to wait like three
[18:40.930 --> 18:44.530]  days and you got to come back and check and then maybe you'll see what you did. He's like, I want
[18:44.530 --> 18:49.810]  it now. He thinks he should mix it up and see explosions for the way plants work. Sometimes it
[18:49.810 --> 18:55.010]  works. Sometimes it does. But it's funny watching you be baffled. I know how much you know about
[18:55.010 --> 19:00.130]  science and organics. And to see you look at me like, dude, how come? And it's just the smallest
[19:00.130 --> 19:03.890]  thing that you overlooked. It's great seeing you learn like that. But sometimes it does slow you
[19:03.890 --> 19:07.090]  down. Sometimes it totally shoots you in the foot because you don't believe that the plants will do
[19:07.090 --> 19:11.410]  what I think they should do on their own. You want everything to be the incredible Hulk?
[19:11.410 --> 19:17.250]  Yes, on steroids. On steroids. Rawr. All right. So we're going to talk a little bit about nutrients.
[19:17.250 --> 19:20.610]  I was hoping Jesse would be here because he really has a lot of cool shit to contribute,
[19:20.610 --> 19:24.930]  but I will cover, I will try to, I'll go like, I'll put my voice really deep. I'll turn up the
[19:24.930 --> 19:29.090]  lows on the microphone. So maybe we get it. No, I didn't know. But I'll turn up my voice real deep
[19:29.090 --> 19:33.890]  and I'll do Jesse's parts. Most of what we're going to cover today will be based on bottled
[19:33.890 --> 19:37.810]  nutrients. I think it's a lot easier for a new home grower to learn what's a good line of bottled
[19:37.810 --> 19:41.890]  newts. Next week, I'm going to have a guy named Sean over. You know what? It may be two weeks
[19:41.890 --> 19:45.010]  until I have Sean over. We got to see what happens with the secret cup. No, I should,
[19:45.010 --> 19:48.770]  Sean will be here next week. Maybe Spence will be here the week after with the secret cup victory.
[19:48.770 --> 19:53.490]  That's what I'm hoping for. Sean's going to teach us about organics and sustainable horticulture.
[19:54.130 --> 19:57.730]  Sean doesn't use, to the best of my knowledge, Sean doesn't use any hydro store products.
[19:59.250 --> 20:03.170]  But for today's lesson, we're going to focus on basics. Bottled nutrients are usually reliable
[20:03.570 --> 20:08.130]  and consistent. Our good friend Adam, who couldn't be here tonight, he specifically asked me
[20:08.130 --> 20:12.450]  what he needs to be feeding his plants. And he also asked what the numbers on the front of the
[20:12.450 --> 20:16.450]  bottles mean. So I think the numbers on the front of the bottle is a good question and it's a super
[20:16.450 --> 20:20.530]  good spot to start. So we'll talk about that. There are three numbers. If you go to the hydro
[20:20.530 --> 20:24.450]  shop and you pick up almost any fertilizer bottle, there are three numbers on the front.
[20:25.090 --> 20:30.450]  The first number represents nitrogen. The second number represents phosphorus. And the third number
[20:30.450 --> 20:36.610]  represents potassium. That's NPK. Those are known as macro nutrients. So a bottle of basic
[20:36.610 --> 20:42.610]  grow nutrients, like if you grab Botanicare Pure Blend Pro, or maybe some advanced nutrients,
[20:42.610 --> 20:48.930]  Jungle Juice Grow, the numbers on there are going to be like 325 or 216 or something like that.
[20:48.930 --> 20:54.290]  Each brand is going to be different. So if it says 325, that's what we're going to work with now,
[20:54.290 --> 21:01.250]  325. It means there's 3% nitrogen, 2% phosphorus, and 5% potassium in that bottle.
[21:01.890 --> 21:07.010]  So the numbers on those bottles tell us the NPK values of what the NPK values are of the
[21:07.010 --> 21:12.370]  fertilizers we're buying. But it's up to us to figure out which bottles to use and when to use
[21:12.370 --> 21:16.770]  them and how much to use. Most of the nutrient companies make a really cool nutrient calculator
[21:16.770 --> 21:20.130]  that you can get at the hydro shop. A lot of times it's in a little insert thing, like a coupon right
[21:20.130 --> 21:24.770]  next to the brand. Get those. Those are always super helpful. A lot of times Tony will be like,
[21:24.770 --> 21:29.250]  how much of this nutrient do I use? And since I'm kind of a nerd, I've happened to have a bunch of
[21:29.250 --> 21:32.370]  those little inserts laying around and I'll just pull it out and be like, it says this.
[21:33.730 --> 21:38.130]  But I definitely recommend reducing the recommended dosage to about half of what
[21:38.130 --> 21:42.370]  they say you use. Sometimes two thirds. You can tell. We'll talk more about that. I wrote that
[21:42.370 --> 21:50.050]  part down. So most of the companies make a chart or also online. You can go online to botanicare.com
[21:50.210 --> 21:54.850]  or advancednutrients.com. I know they have super great feeding schedule calculators.
[21:55.490 --> 21:59.650]  If you use a pre-developed recipe from there, they'll tell you exactly what to use every week.
[22:00.370 --> 22:03.250]  I suggest you reduce the dosage, like I was saying, to about half. Those companies,
[22:03.250 --> 22:07.330]  they want to sell you more. They really want you to buy more shit. So they tell you to use a little
[22:07.330 --> 22:13.410]  bit extra, like five or 10 milliliters every week adds up to them and to you, but you don't notice
[22:13.410 --> 22:18.690]  it. Your plants won't notice it. So they kind of overfeed your plants on purpose. So reduce what
[22:18.690 --> 22:23.890]  they say. If you see signs of a deficiency, you can increase your fertilizer on the next feed,
[22:23.890 --> 22:30.690]  but you can't, if you overfeed, you can't correct that. You've got burnt leaves and angry roots and
[22:30.690 --> 22:35.330]  your plants look all fucking fried out. I think I've seen a couple of your plants do that one time.
[22:37.170 --> 22:41.250]  Tony's not afraid to mess with some plants. Tony is all about getting in there and torturing the
[22:41.250 --> 22:46.450]  shit out of his crop. And so usually pH burns. I was going to talk a lot about pH burns. If we
[22:46.450 --> 22:50.530]  have time, I'm going to try to go about 45 to an hour here, but if we have time for pH, we'll get
[22:50.530 --> 22:56.290]  into it. Something I recommend, and this is part of what I think Tony shoots himself in the foot
[22:56.290 --> 22:59.650]  with. I recommend that if you're going to use a brand of bottled nutrients, you stick with the
[22:59.650 --> 23:04.130]  brand until you become experienced and you can identify deficiencies and problems, which means
[23:04.130 --> 23:08.930]  a few things. First, if you use Botanicare Pure Blend Pro as a base, I totally recommend using
[23:09.490 --> 23:14.530]  whatever Botanicare Pure Blend Pro additives you can afford to add, but don't mix stuff from other
[23:14.530 --> 23:19.490]  brands. I know that sounds ridiculous like brand loyalty or a sales pitch, but I think it's rational
[23:19.490 --> 23:24.370]  with any brand and I'll explain why. I don't mix brands because of, and Tony will like this,
[23:24.370 --> 23:29.970]  chelation, buffers, and bonding agents versus organics. A lot of products have chemicals that
[23:29.970 --> 23:35.090]  make the products last longer. Some have chemicals that prevent certain compounds from bonding inside
[23:35.090 --> 23:39.810]  the bottle and ruining the solution. And many of those chemicals will ruin all of the beneficial
[23:39.810 --> 23:45.490]  compounds in an organic solution. Tony may correct me on this. I feel like if I poured
[23:45.490 --> 23:49.490]  some synthetic nutrient, like if I got almost anything from advanced nutrients, if I poured
[23:49.490 --> 23:55.090]  Big Bud into a batch of organic compost tea, I think the Big Bud would kill most of the bioactivity
[23:55.090 --> 24:01.410]  in my compost tea. Is that correct? I think Big Bud, especially like Overdrive definitely
[24:01.410 --> 24:05.890]  would wreak havoc. Okay. How about my Mico's? Is it just going to destroy my Mico life?
[24:05.890 --> 24:11.650]  Destroy your Mico's and actually it's probably going to bring things out of solution,
[24:12.530 --> 24:18.850]  like calcium compounds. And those, once they're unavailable to the plant, they actually
[24:18.850 --> 24:22.930]  create other deficiencies. It's all about balance apparently.
[24:22.930 --> 24:27.810]  All right. You just over, you definitely enforced what I was trying to say. I sound like I know what
[24:27.810 --> 24:32.770]  I'm talking about now. All right. So unless you're sure the product gets along with other products,
[24:32.770 --> 24:36.930]  you shouldn't be adding two things from different brands because you could cause problems. You could
[24:36.930 --> 24:41.650]  have everything going for the first six weeks and then you go and add in some bud booster that
[24:41.650 --> 24:46.370]  doesn't match up with your schedule and it could totally just ruin all the work you've done for the
[24:46.370 --> 24:52.770]  past veg time plus six weeks of flower. So another reason I stick with one brand is because as you
[24:52.770 --> 24:56.850]  learn, you need something to be consistent. As many things as you can need to be consistent.
[24:56.850 --> 25:01.170]  It's hard to adapt to changes and identify problems with too many variables. I feel like
[25:01.170 --> 25:05.810]  if we minimize the variables, we can dial in our crops to perfection. If you're not truly happy with
[25:05.810 --> 25:09.410]  your nutrients, you can for sure switch them. But I recommend trying the same brand while you learn.
[25:09.970 --> 25:13.970]  I know I keep talking about it, but I personally, I like Botanicare. I've used advanced nutrients.
[25:14.530 --> 25:20.450]  I felt like with advanced, I got huge buds and everything finished really quickly. But I also
[25:20.450 --> 25:25.250]  feel like everything looked and smelled and tasted the same. I don't think there was much variation.
[25:25.250 --> 25:31.170]  If I ran OG Kush, Sour Diesel, Strawberry Haze, they all kind of had the same advanced nutrients.
[25:31.170 --> 25:32.290]  They all smelled like Nirvana.
[25:32.290 --> 25:38.050]  Chris Willis 05.05 Oh yeah. And advanced, it's actually kind of like junk food. It's the wrong
[25:38.050 --> 25:43.330]  kind of nitrogen that you'd want for healthy plants. They look nice, but they're not actually
[25:43.330 --> 25:44.370]  as healthy as they should be.
[25:44.370 --> 25:48.770]  Chris Willis 05.05 Okay. I didn't ever think of that. All I could tell is that they were taken
[25:48.770 --> 25:52.610]  off. And for what I paid, I could tell I was getting my money's worth. I was getting that
[25:52.610 --> 25:57.010]  extra that they advertise, but I didn't like the flavor. And when you're growing crops for yourself,
[25:57.010 --> 26:02.050]  I want the flavor. I want the flavor I want. I grew with Syco. I did a couple of rounds with
[26:02.050 --> 26:07.410]  Syco. They actually gave me a free box set and I ran it side by side next to Botanicare. And I have
[26:07.410 --> 26:11.730]  a five by five hut next to a five by five hut. Everything is the same. It's in the same room.
[26:11.730 --> 26:16.690]  And I did Syco on one side, Botanicare on the other. The Syco side, everything turned really,
[26:16.690 --> 26:21.170]  really purple and it was sexy. It was really photogenic bud. Once again, I didn't like the
[26:21.170 --> 26:27.330]  flavor. It didn't burn as well and it had a funky flavor. I used Sol Synthetics from Aurora,
[26:28.050 --> 26:33.250]  excuse me, from Aurora Innovations. And it has a lot of molasses-y type stuff, a lot of humic stuff,
[26:33.250 --> 26:37.810]  and that made for tasty, tasty buds. But it didn't give me enough harvest and it didn't
[26:37.810 --> 26:42.050]  get real resiny. It tasted super good, but I didn't get the harvest I wanted. Humboldt
[26:42.050 --> 26:46.610]  Nutrients, that stuff worked well, but there's a lot of PGRs and things I'm trying to get away from
[26:46.610 --> 26:52.130]  in there. Just like Advanced Nutrients, I don't want to use a lot of PGRs and things like that.
[26:52.130 --> 26:56.770]  Humboldt did well, but again, I prefer Botanicare for the flavor. That's what I like the best.
[26:57.490 --> 27:02.850]  It's all about tea. Yeah. Now it's getting to be all about the teas. The guy that's coming on next
[27:02.850 --> 27:07.810]  week is all about making super awesome teas. So for my personal, I'll always probably go back to
[27:07.810 --> 27:12.210]  the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro with all the additives recommended. I also use C-Plex
[27:12.930 --> 27:17.650]  and from the Organicare lineup, and I'll add some kind of molasses and yucca extract
[27:17.650 --> 27:21.490]  and maybe some dehydrated coconut water to my feeding toward the middle of bloom.
[27:21.490 --> 27:24.690]  But that's our secret. So don't ever say that on a podcast where people could hear you.
[27:24.690 --> 27:31.250]  It's actually good for beginner growers, pile on the yucca, your air tolerance for temperatures and
[27:31.250 --> 27:36.290]  a bunch of things. Yeah. It's very good for you. It's kind of like aloe vera on a sunburn,
[27:36.290 --> 27:40.130]  except inside. I know that sounds weird, but it definitely works to moisten things up and
[27:40.130 --> 27:44.930]  keep things safe. A good source of yucca extract. If you don't want to just go find yucca extract
[27:44.930 --> 27:49.410]  and figure out how to use that, Humboldt Honey is actually packed with yucca extract and it's
[27:49.410 --> 27:54.370]  a great product. You need something with molasses and sugars in it anyway late in bloom. So that's
[27:54.370 --> 27:59.730]  what I would recommend. If anybody from Botanicare is listening, you can send me an email and I'll
[27:59.730 --> 28:04.130]  get you my shipping address and sponsorship info. I'm iRegenetics on Instagram. Check out my feed.
[28:05.010 --> 28:09.650]  Yeah. Botanicare. I buy a lot of your stuff, guys. Talk to me. Hello. All right.
[28:09.650 --> 28:12.930]  Another reason I would stick to one brand is because doubling up on nutrient brands,
[28:13.650 --> 28:17.650]  you could actually double up on something you don't want. You could have overlap. There could
[28:17.650 --> 28:24.370]  be too much magnesium in this one or too much, I don't know, molybdenum in this one. And you don't
[28:24.370 --> 28:28.450]  realize it because they don't list all that small stuff on every bottle. So if you use something
[28:28.450 --> 28:33.490]  from Botanicare, something from Advanced Nutrients, you may possibly be overdosing your plant with
[28:33.490 --> 28:41.970]  something. And so Botanicare is not going to make a nutrient A with nutrient B that would
[28:41.970 --> 28:46.690]  overlap. And they kind of wouldn't do that. They know that that's in there. Sorry, guys,
[28:46.690 --> 28:49.010]  my throat's all clogged up from taking those dabs that killed Jesse.
[28:49.010 --> 28:52.450]  Yeah. No, I should say that most of the nutrient companies make their own
[28:53.170 --> 28:58.770]  mycoproducts. Those you can go a little outside the line for.
[28:58.770 --> 29:00.130]  Oh yeah. Absolutely.
[29:00.770 --> 29:04.610]  As well as there's a few other things like enzymes.
[29:04.610 --> 29:05.810]  Yes. Enzymes.
[29:06.370 --> 29:12.210]  For enzymes, I always recommend the Hygrozyme. And for mycos lately, all of the OGT products
[29:12.210 --> 29:18.050]  are freaking awesome. And I also like Great White Shark myself. I put those in almost every plant.
[29:18.690 --> 29:21.650]  If you want to go the Advanced Nutrients route and you want to spend a lot of money,
[29:21.650 --> 29:29.010]  that Piranha and Tarantula in the liquid bottles, it's $183.50 per bottle. But like 10 or 20 mils
[29:29.010 --> 29:33.330]  will give you explosive roots. Put that shit in your cloner. If you've got an easy cloner,
[29:33.330 --> 29:37.010]  your roots will push the lid off the cloner. Your plants will get up and walk away.
[29:38.050 --> 29:41.810]  Yeah. So once you guys get comfortable and have a good understanding of your feeding routine,
[29:41.810 --> 29:45.730]  you can add whatever you feel like you need. Just read the bottles, adjust your PPMs
[29:45.730 --> 29:51.010]  accordingly, and pay attention to what you're feeding the plants. Just read the labels.
[29:51.970 --> 29:56.130]  Read them. Go to the website and find out what's in those products. They should be readily available.
[29:56.130 --> 29:59.010]  If a company doesn't want to tell you what's in their stuff, I don't want to use it. It's
[29:59.010 --> 30:04.050]  kind of how I feel anyway. I wrote down a side note talking about PPMs. A friend of mine was
[30:04.050 --> 30:10.450]  having problems with this crop. His leaves were curling up, looking like goofy fingers. I thought
[30:10.450 --> 30:15.170]  it was a light leak during the dark cycle. He thought it was the genetics. Everybody was real
[30:15.170 --> 30:18.770]  confused. Sorry, I just burped right into the microphone. Everybody was real confused, but
[30:19.650 --> 30:23.170]  the room is correct. He had good genetics. And after a few days, we realized the problem.
[30:23.170 --> 30:28.930]  His magnetic ballasts were causing interference with the PPM and pH meter, and everything was way
[30:28.930 --> 30:33.970]  off. So he's thinking he's balancing out the pH perfectly, six, five, seven, and he's actually
[30:33.970 --> 30:39.010]  making it 11 or lower. He's probably going down. It's probably like four because that low is
[30:39.010 --> 30:46.690]  probably what made everything curl. He's getting it real low. So what I was going to say is try to
[30:46.690 --> 30:51.970]  get away from your magnetic ballasts so that when you take readings, your magnetic ballasts aren't
[30:51.970 --> 30:55.890]  making everything jump up and down. And also take good care of your PPM and pH meters. People
[30:55.890 --> 31:01.010]  overlook those, and they're super important. Jesse recommended making the cords as short as possible
[31:01.570 --> 31:06.050]  in your grow rooms. And that would definitely help with stuff like having your PPM meter
[31:06.050 --> 31:10.850]  fluctuate so heavily. But it'll take a couple of weeks, but his plants will be back on track. He's
[31:10.850 --> 31:14.770]  just a couple of weeks behind. They'll look good. All right, so we're talking about nutrients. That
[31:14.770 --> 31:19.170]  was a side note I wanted to make sure to get out. Our main goal here with nutrients is to have the
[31:19.170 --> 31:23.730]  correct amount of nutrients at the right time to keep the plants at peak performance without ever
[31:23.730 --> 31:28.530]  overfeeding them and causing nutrient burn or lockouts. And also I wrote down, don't forget
[31:28.530 --> 31:33.570]  to pay attention to your pH. And also I said, when you see problems that look like deficiencies,
[31:33.570 --> 31:37.890]  they are often from a pH issue that was overlooked. If you're going to push your plants to perform,
[31:37.890 --> 31:43.890]  you need to have the proper pH. I think 6.5 to 7 is ideal for most cannabis strains. You're going
[31:43.890 --> 31:49.890]  to have to adjust to your room, your environment, and your strain. The cocoa fiber people, they have
[31:49.890 --> 31:56.130]  a different range. And then the regular deep water culture hydro people, I think they want it down in
[31:56.130 --> 32:00.290]  the five fives. Yeah, that sounds about right. Most of what I talk about is soil. Sorry guys,
[32:00.290 --> 32:04.690]  I'm a soilless kind of guy. Most everything I do is in soilless mix, indoors, under a thousand
[32:04.690 --> 32:10.690]  watt lights. So you'll have to adjust. Everything is about adapting. All right, good call. Right
[32:10.770 --> 32:15.650]  off for reminding those people or me. So during the veg phase, your plants are going to want
[32:16.610 --> 32:20.770]  high levels of nitrogen. As the plants progress into the flowering stage, they're going to require
[32:20.770 --> 32:25.170]  much less nitrogen and they're going to want more phosphorus and potassium. So we're going to kind
[32:25.170 --> 32:28.930]  of shift into explaining the nutrients and their functions, which is cool that Tony's here for this
[32:28.930 --> 32:33.890]  one because he knows a lot. You hear us talk about NPK. We'll focus on nitrogen, phosphorus,
[32:33.890 --> 32:38.210]  and potassium. We'll go with nitrogen first. You'll almost always hear nitrogen first.
[32:38.850 --> 32:44.050]  Most of what you breathe is nitrogen. It's an odorless colorless gas that constitutes over 75%
[32:44.050 --> 32:48.370]  of the earth's atmosphere. Despite the overwhelming presence of atmospheric nitrogen,
[32:48.370 --> 32:53.250]  there are only a few kinds of plants in the legume family that can make use of it.
[32:53.250 --> 32:57.730]  Marijuana is not a legume. Oh, it should say cannabis. Geez, I cut and pasted this from the
[32:57.730 --> 33:01.250]  internet. I'll give them credit in a minute. I just don't want to break away from my focus here.
[33:01.890 --> 33:06.530]  Where is the website that I stole this from? Yeah, I don't want to stumble around and do too many
[33:06.530 --> 33:10.450]  things and mess up with the computer and get distracted. So marijuana is not a legume,
[33:10.450 --> 33:15.650]  so nitrogen must be supplemented. Synthetically produced nitrogen fertilizer is made in the form
[33:15.650 --> 33:20.370]  of anhydrous ammonia from natural gas. Yeah, that's what I said. Anhydrous ammonia from natural
[33:20.370 --> 33:25.970]  gas. Anhydrous ammonia is then usually converted into ammonium nitrate for storage and ease of
[33:25.970 --> 33:31.330]  application. Once granulated, the ammonium nitrate is ready for use as cost-effective and easy to use
[33:31.330 --> 33:36.770]  plant food. Natural sources of nitrogen are numerous and include blood meal, manure,
[33:36.770 --> 33:41.170]  bird and bat guano, among many others. All right, guys, Sean will be here next week. I'm going to
[33:41.170 --> 33:45.890]  jump in for a minute. He'll be here next week to discuss this all organic method. He calls it
[33:45.890 --> 33:50.610]  organic as fuck. Once you hear about your nutrients being fed, being made with anhydrous ammonia,
[33:50.610 --> 33:54.370]  it kind of makes you start getting more interested in that sustainable horticulture stuff.
[33:54.370 --> 33:59.570]  Well, it sounds kind of weird and extreme, like some crazy chemistry, but it actually happens in
[33:59.570 --> 34:08.210]  the soil itself. There's a little cycle that nitrates, ammonium nitrites and actually pure
[34:08.210 --> 34:16.690]  NH3 ammonia are converted back and forth by your micos. Sometimes you'll buy a pack of micos,
[34:16.690 --> 34:23.410]  it'll say nitrogen fixing. That's what they're talking about. They convert nitrates usually into
[34:23.410 --> 34:30.290]  the ammoniums. So it happens in the soil anyway, but that's actually what makes advanced nutrients
[34:30.290 --> 34:34.770]  junk food. It's all nitrates. You want to have some ammonium ions in there too.
[34:35.410 --> 34:36.130]  Wow.
[34:36.130 --> 34:43.570]  And they actually do exist in the composted organic stuff. They're just produced usually by
[34:44.210 --> 34:45.890]  bacteria, aerobic decay.
[34:46.610 --> 34:52.610]  So Tony's got access to all of the ingredient lists and studies from the colleges because he's
[34:52.610 --> 34:57.250]  a college kid and he's read some great shit and told me some great things about nutrients and it's
[34:57.250 --> 35:03.890]  that stuff right there that's golden. All right. So where was I? I'm talking about Sean's coming.
[35:03.890 --> 35:09.090]  Dude, once I read about this stuff, I got kind of like, I want to go more toward a sustainable way
[35:09.090 --> 35:12.850]  of growing my plants. I think it would be better. That's my next step. I can grow, I can breed,
[35:12.850 --> 35:18.370]  I can select phenotypes. I can identify problems. Everything in my game is strong. Now I just got
[35:18.370 --> 35:24.210]  to adjust and get more eco-friendly. Quit using so much electricity and Hydroshop stuff.
[35:25.490 --> 35:28.610]  Much love to my Hydroshop sponsor. I just got to get away from some of that stuff.
[35:29.810 --> 35:33.650]  So because I was talking about nitrogen, because of its crucial role in photosynthesis,
[35:33.650 --> 35:37.330]  fertilizers high in nitrogen are used during the vegetative phase of growing cannabis.
[35:38.050 --> 35:42.770]  Nitrogen is key to both chlorophyll and protein production and used throughout photosynthesis for
[35:42.770 --> 35:48.930]  the conversion of carbon into sugars and other organic compounds. So grow fertilizers are high
[35:48.930 --> 35:53.010]  in nitrogen. They're used for rapid growth. They're used to build chlorophyll and promote
[35:53.010 --> 35:59.250]  a healthy green color and they improve the volume and health of plant foliage. You guys,
[35:59.250 --> 36:03.490]  if you see your plants looking pale and yellow, that's your first sign of probably a nitrogen
[36:03.490 --> 36:09.490]  deficiency. Oh yeah. Oh, we're 35 minutes in. We'll get through these nutrients at least.
[36:09.490 --> 36:15.490]  This will be cool. Yeah. I should say that the plant, most plants in general, will intake
[36:16.610 --> 36:23.170]  80% of all of the nitrogen they use in a lifetime during the vegetative stage. So that's why all
[36:23.170 --> 36:28.610]  your vegetative cannabis nutrients have a higher nitrogen value than flowering ones.
[36:28.610 --> 36:30.530]  Then you cut that out right at the start of flowering?
[36:30.530 --> 36:35.730]  It stores it up for metabolic processes. Okay. So it just saves, just chilling in there.
[36:35.730 --> 36:37.970]  Yeah. It's part of carbohydrates actually.
[36:38.530 --> 36:42.210]  It stores it up as energy and then releases it during flower.
[36:42.210 --> 36:49.250]  So I usually feed my veg nutrients until about two weeks into flower so that I'm giving them
[36:49.250 --> 36:52.130]  more nitrogen to have available. Should I just switch right away?
[36:53.650 --> 36:57.090]  That's what I've been doing, but mine turned yellow way too fast.
[36:57.090 --> 37:01.010]  All right. Then I'll just keep feeding that next, that extra two weeks kind of seems to keep them
[37:01.650 --> 37:05.650]  green for the time that I need. No, there's like veganic sources of plant
[37:05.650 --> 37:12.290]  nitrogens, usually amino acids. Those usually, they direct you to use those up to flush,
[37:13.090 --> 37:19.810]  which I've not figured out why, but it's the good nitrogen. Lots of it.
[37:19.810 --> 37:23.890]  Veganics is way different. I've grown a veganic crop with some veganic nutrients I was given,
[37:23.890 --> 37:26.050]  and it had the flavor. It definitely had serious flavor.
[37:26.050 --> 37:30.850]  Well, even if you use a cotton seed or soybean meal, those are very high in
[37:31.810 --> 37:35.650]  weird organic types of nitrogens, usually amino acids and proteins.
[37:36.210 --> 37:39.810]  That's why all these organic guys are getting great results. They're using actually naturally
[37:39.810 --> 37:43.410]  occurring nitrogen sources. But you have to have a high,
[37:43.410 --> 37:50.530]  highly active microsphere there. Lots of bacterias and rhizomes. So you have to be using...
[37:50.530 --> 37:54.130]  I can't wait for Sean to come. Listen to the next episode with Sean. You'll love it. You'll love it.
[37:54.130 --> 37:58.370]  All right. Let's talk a little bit about phosphorus. Phosphorus is a volatile and reactive
[37:58.370 --> 38:02.690]  element, which is why it is probably never found in its pure elemental form in nature.
[38:02.690 --> 38:08.130]  Because of its volatility, fertilizer packaging is actually showing a measure of its oxide,
[38:08.130 --> 38:15.250]  P2O5. Phosphorus is commonly refined from stone called phosphatite or mined from guano islands,
[38:15.250 --> 38:21.330]  comprised of primarily bird and bat droppings. A common biomass of source of phosphorus is found
[38:21.330 --> 38:27.170]  in the ground bone, also known as bone meal. Cannabis plants use the phosphorus throughout
[38:27.170 --> 38:31.730]  their growing cycles, but at elevated levels when flowering. As the plant's nutrient requirements
[38:31.730 --> 38:36.370]  change, the feeding schedule is adjusted to include bloom foods with higher levels of phosphorus
[38:36.370 --> 38:41.730]  and lower levels of nitrogen. Because plants also use phosphorus in root formation, low doses of it
[38:41.730 --> 38:47.730]  are often found in cloning solutions. So phosphorus basically... Bloom foods are
[38:47.730 --> 38:53.250]  higher in phosphorus. Phosphorus improves bud production. Phosphorus aids in root development,
[38:53.250 --> 38:57.730]  and it's involved in oil and glucose production in the end of your blooming cycle.
[38:57.730 --> 39:00.770]  Nick Loper Yeah. You're actually... You want your highest
[39:00.770 --> 39:07.010]  phosphorus levels a few weeks before flower and for the first third of flower.
[39:07.010 --> 39:11.810]  Chris Okay. So boost those up just like we did with the nitrogen?
[39:11.810 --> 39:15.330]  Nick Loper Yeah. The nitrogen starts to drop down,
[39:15.330 --> 39:20.850]  and that's when the phosphorus goes up. And then towards the middle end of flower, you want lots
[39:20.850 --> 39:24.530]  and lots of K. So you want a very, very high last number.
[39:24.530 --> 39:29.890]  Chris Okay. All right. Let's talk about K. Potassium. Potassium is an alkali metal that
[39:29.890 --> 39:35.570]  reacts violently with water and oxidizes quite rapidly when exposed to air. This unstable nature
[39:35.570 --> 39:40.130]  requires that it be added to fertilizers in the form of potassium compounds known as potash.
[39:40.850 --> 39:46.610]  Not all forms of potash are suitable for plants. Like phosphorus, potassium is mined from mineral
[39:46.610 --> 39:53.730]  laden ore. Like N and P, potassium, which is K, is a key component in the metabolic functions of
[39:53.730 --> 39:58.530]  plants and plays a large role in the production of proteins and photosynthesis. Potassium also
[39:58.530 --> 40:02.530]  helps strengthen the marijuana plant's immune system. I'm going to correct that, cannabis
[40:02.530 --> 40:07.650]  plant's immune system, which helps the plants cope with environmental stresses, including insects and
[40:07.650 --> 40:13.090]  diseases. Bloom formulated fertilizers often include increased levels of potassium because
[40:13.090 --> 40:18.690]  it helps improve flower quality. So potassium is found in both grow and bloom fertilizers because
[40:18.690 --> 40:23.730]  Tony was saying that it's good towards the end of edge. It helps the plant's immune system and it
[40:23.730 --> 40:27.730]  increases flower quality. You'll see it in most of your bloom boosters. It'll be real high in
[40:27.730 --> 40:32.530]  potassium. So if you're looking for a bloom booster and a bud hardener, that last number
[40:32.530 --> 40:37.970]  on the bottle, that's the one you're looking at. So would you agree with me that that's the basics
[40:37.970 --> 40:45.010]  of the NPK? Yeah. You want to start high in nitrogen and then end very low and then start
[40:45.970 --> 40:52.450]  mid to low potassium and end very, very high. Very high. Yeah. And then the phosphorus kind of
[40:52.450 --> 40:56.610]  like goes in like a little mountain hump. There's some plants I feel like you almost can't give them
[40:56.610 --> 41:03.330]  too much phosphorus. It's a timing thing actually. I feed them a bunch of it right as they're going
[41:03.330 --> 41:10.450]  into flower. And then when I noticed the buds have naturally stopped swelling up, I dose them
[41:10.450 --> 41:16.530]  with quite a bit more. And then their little metabolism kicks back on for like one more week.
[41:16.530 --> 41:22.050]  Yeah. If you kick a lot of potassium in them, it keeps them moving. It definitely keeps them from
[41:22.050 --> 41:26.610]  slowing down and your plants don't get as lazy. All right. So we'll talk a little more specifically
[41:26.610 --> 41:30.610]  about when to feed things to our plants. When the plants are young, we kind of covered this,
[41:30.610 --> 41:34.530]  but when the plants are young, they don't require as much fertilization. I focus on
[41:34.530 --> 41:38.210]  root building when the plants are young. Mycos are your friend and enzymes are too.
[41:38.770 --> 41:42.050]  We've talked about mycos and enzymes on the show before. We'll come back to that
[41:42.050 --> 41:47.330]  once we get all the basics covered. That's your OGT and your hygrozyme if you guys are looking
[41:47.330 --> 41:51.970]  for products. Use them just like they say on the bottle. Those are perfect. Small plants want
[41:51.970 --> 41:57.730]  nitrogen to grow strong. A little bit of phosphorus will help them build roots and grow vigorously.
[41:57.730 --> 42:01.890]  A little potassium will keep them healthy. Your basic veg nutrients probably have enough
[42:01.890 --> 42:06.530]  NPK to get you through your veg phase. If you veg for long periods, you may need to add some
[42:06.530 --> 42:11.810]  calcium magnesium. That's something that larger plants will start running out of. So let's talk
[42:11.810 --> 42:16.050]  a little bit about CalMag while we're here. Calcium and magnesium are what are known as
[42:16.050 --> 42:21.170]  secondary nutrients. Calcium is a big part of the cell structure and cellular growth. Calcium
[42:21.170 --> 42:27.090]  stimulates enzymes that build strong roots and cell walls. Magnesium is essential to absorb light
[42:27.090 --> 42:32.690]  energy. If your plants are slow and lazy, they may be experiencing a magnesium deficiency.
[42:33.650 --> 42:38.770]  Yeah. There's certain types of yellowing between the veins. It's magnesium deficiency.
[42:38.770 --> 42:41.730]  Magnesium is actually what makes chlorophyll green.
[42:41.730 --> 42:46.210]  A little bit of humega from Organicare will speed your plants up when they start getting lazy like
[42:46.210 --> 42:50.930]  that. Yeah. Yeah. So in the beginning, you need nitrogen, a little phosphorus, and a little
[42:50.930 --> 42:55.010]  potassium. If you're looking for big roots, definitely add some type of mycos or root
[42:55.010 --> 42:59.810]  inoculant. I always brag about the OGT and great white shark together. That shit works great for
[42:59.810 --> 43:05.330]  your roots. You get big, fat, white roots. If you feed OGT and great white shark along with your
[43:05.330 --> 43:09.250]  mix, your regular feed schedule in the morning, right when the plants come on, if you go in about
[43:09.250 --> 43:14.450]  two hours later, most of your leaves will be pointing straight up and they're praying and
[43:14.450 --> 43:18.690]  thanking you. They're saying, holy shit, I love that. That's what they're doing. They love that
[43:18.690 --> 43:22.770]  shit. If your plants get a little too big in veg, you're going to need CalMag. Once you enter the
[43:22.770 --> 43:27.090]  flower phase, totally like we talked about, reduce the nitrogen. The first two weeks of flower won't
[43:27.090 --> 43:31.170]  show you much. Keep the plants fed and happy. I use my grow-based nutrient until week three of
[43:31.170 --> 43:36.450]  flower, like I was talking about. I feel like it keeps them nicely nitrogened up until the end of
[43:36.450 --> 43:43.330]  flower. I add some CalMag and put some potassium silicates in, and also some type of kelp at week
[43:43.330 --> 43:49.730]  three. So that's CalMag, potassium silicates, and kelp at week three. I'll add liquid karma and sweet
[43:49.810 --> 43:53.490]  wheat at week three also. So when you start week three of flower, you can drop out most of the
[43:53.490 --> 43:58.210]  nitrogen and really start pumping up the P and K. Week four, I do the same thing as week three.
[44:00.610 --> 44:04.930]  We should be low on nitrogen and pumping up the P and K. I'd add some kelp and a small amount
[44:04.930 --> 44:09.650]  of molasses by now. I would also add some enzymes to my mix. I'd be running the whole Botanicare
[44:09.650 --> 44:16.130]  feed chart by week four. So here we go. Week five is where I really pound my plants with food. I
[44:16.130 --> 44:20.050]  think day 30 is where they're really ready for sugars and boosters. That's when they're really
[44:20.050 --> 44:24.690]  ready to get hammered with a lot of stuff. So I've dropped the nitrogen by now and I'm feeding
[44:24.690 --> 44:30.690]  heavy doses of P and K. I'd be adding my bloom boosters and lots of molasses and sugars. CalMag
[44:30.690 --> 44:35.250]  would be super important for the next couple of weeks. Enzymes and kelp would also be helpful for
[44:35.250 --> 44:42.370]  big tasty buds. I think kelp, I use a lot of C-Plex. I think all that kelp really adds to the
[44:42.370 --> 44:48.370]  stink and the density. It really adds to the... Some flavors, if they have that foot, cushy skunk
[44:48.370 --> 44:53.490]  smell, that stink, it kind of makes them come out a little bit better if you add a lot of kelp.
[44:54.130 --> 44:58.450]  So you should add some potassium silicates for thick branches at this time, like week five,
[44:58.450 --> 45:02.770]  week 30-ish. Maybe you could have put those in at week four, but if you've got good healthy plants,
[45:02.770 --> 45:06.370]  I think they're cool on week five. You just need them to build those branches up a little bit while
[45:06.370 --> 45:09.650]  the buds grow too super thick because they're going to start falling over if you don't have
[45:09.650 --> 45:14.610]  some kind of tomato cages. So week five is basically your bloom-based nutrients,
[45:14.610 --> 45:21.330]  lots of bud boosters, sugars, enzymes, potassium silicates, and kelp. Week six will basically be
[45:21.330 --> 45:26.370]  the same thing. Focus on your bud boosters and sugars and get that stuff up there as high as
[45:26.370 --> 45:31.410]  you can without burning the plants. Put a lot of molasses in there, a lot of P and K products,
[45:32.130 --> 45:37.330]  and some enzymes in there to keep all of that stuff moving. You do the same thing up to
[45:38.050 --> 45:42.370]  however long you need to go. Week seven, week eight, usually don't feed after week nine. You
[45:42.370 --> 45:46.370]  should start flushing by week eight. Most plants aren't going to go more than 10 weeks. If you're
[45:46.370 --> 45:49.730]  growing a plant that takes more than 10 weeks, I hope you're experienced and I hope all of this
[45:49.730 --> 45:55.330]  stuff already makes sense to you because that's going to be a bitch for you to grow an 11-week
[45:55.330 --> 46:00.690]  plant without this knowledge. So once you get to week eight and you've gotten done feeding these
[46:00.690 --> 46:04.930]  plants and keeping them happy and healthy, you need to flush. We've just talked about how much
[46:04.930 --> 46:11.730]  stuff we poured into these plants. Now you need to spend at least 10 to 14 days with nothing but
[46:11.730 --> 46:17.890]  water in these plants. So on Monday, however much, if you've got a five-gallon pot, pour water
[46:17.890 --> 46:20.850]  through it until that shit's running through, until your tray is almost full, until you're
[46:20.850 --> 46:24.050]  worried about it. If you have a way to get that water out of the tray, that's ideal.
[46:24.770 --> 46:27.570]  And get that water out of there and let those plants sit until they're almost dry
[46:28.370 --> 46:32.610]  and do the same thing all over again. And do that for the next 10 to 14 days. Try to get three or
[46:32.610 --> 46:36.770]  four cycles of just clean water through there so that you can push out all the nitrogen, the
[46:36.770 --> 46:42.450]  phosphorus, the potassium, the calcium, the magnesium, the mycos that we just put in there.
[46:42.450 --> 46:45.170]  You need to clean your soil out. You want to get all that stuff out of there.
[46:45.170 --> 46:47.090]  Chris Sterns Now if you have like really clean,
[46:48.050 --> 46:53.650]  really clean sorts of like molasses, you could use that. Your first flush watering,
[46:55.250 --> 47:01.490]  quite a bit of that. And sugars, displaced salts, that's why all of the like ClearX that they'll
[47:01.490 --> 47:07.890]  sell you. ClearX is just a bunch of different types of sugars. Displaces salt, but it feeds
[47:07.890 --> 47:13.730]  all of your mycos. Basically it feeds all of them, boosts their colonization up, and they end up
[47:13.730 --> 47:18.370]  eating any residual food that's left. They eat a bunch of it for you, like little garbage disposals.
[47:18.370 --> 47:22.050]  Chris Sterns He just said sugars, displaced salts, you guys.
[47:22.050 --> 47:27.170]  So most of the nutrients you're feeding are salts and your plants are filled with salts.
[47:27.890 --> 47:31.810]  Salts don't taste so good. Sugar, sounds like it tastes good, right? So if you put some sugars in
[47:31.810 --> 47:35.810]  there when you're flushing, it'll push the salts out of your plants. It'll also clean up the soil.
[47:35.810 --> 47:38.210]  It'll break it up kind of. It goes in there and stirs it around, right?
[47:38.210 --> 47:40.290]  Chris Sterns Yeah, feeds your hungry mycos.
[47:40.290 --> 47:42.610]  Michael Sviggum And feeds your hungry mycos, which is always awesome.
[47:43.330 --> 47:47.090]  I want to go to a website. This is where I got a lot of the information about,
[47:47.970 --> 47:53.250]  just a lot of information from this show. It's called marijuanagrowershq.com is where I got a
[47:53.250 --> 47:58.050]  lot of it. And I also got some guidance from the Botanicare website. I'm kind of looking at their
[47:58.050 --> 48:01.970]  feed charts to keep in mind what I would feed every week because I don't have my own feed chart in my
[48:01.970 --> 48:07.890]  hand because it's in the growth spaces. I don't carry that around. But yeah, so that was a shout
[48:07.890 --> 48:13.250]  out to the people that made the charts easy for me to figure out and they made NPK easy for everyone
[48:13.250 --> 48:19.650]  to understand. I think we should stop there on the nutrient lessons because we're 45 minutes in,
[48:19.650 --> 48:23.570]  47 minutes. And I think if we go any further, we'll end up running over an hour and you potheads
[48:23.570 --> 48:28.050]  run out of attention span at 45 minutes. I can tell how long you listen. Stitcher tells me.
[48:28.770 --> 48:32.050]  Tony can definitely tell how long you're listening because he runs all my web stats.
[48:33.170 --> 48:38.610]  We've had about 5,000 listens on the past few episodes, which is remarkable. I want to thank
[48:38.610 --> 48:44.530]  all 5,000 of you. I hope all 5,000 of you continue to listen. It seems like it's about time to wrap
[48:44.530 --> 48:49.010]  up the show. I don't feel like I have much more to cover. Where was that page that I had my topics?
[48:49.090 --> 48:52.690]  I think I covered them all. We're going to say we did because I can't find the damn paper. So
[48:52.690 --> 48:57.330]  we had to have covered all the topics. Oh, the Cannabis Cup was over Thanksgiving.
[48:58.290 --> 49:02.370]  The Vault Genetics, DNA Genetics, big shout out. Shout out to Crockett. I don't remember exactly
[49:02.370 --> 49:06.450]  who won everything, but big shout out to everybody that took home prizes. I hope everybody has a safe
[49:06.450 --> 49:10.690]  trip home. The Cannabis Cup got raided and they shut it down. So they had to move everything.
[49:10.690 --> 49:16.290]  There was no big smokeout expo. All that they did have was the concerts that were supposed to
[49:16.290 --> 49:21.410]  happen. So I hope everybody got home. I hope nobody got in any trouble. So now that the show's
[49:21.410 --> 49:24.770]  over, yes, the show is over. Now that the show is over, dude, Tony, thanks for coming. Yeah,
[49:24.770 --> 49:27.730]  no problem. It was good finally having you on the show, bro. It's been a minute. Yeah,
[49:27.730 --> 49:30.850]  you've been working with me for quite a while. We never had you on a podcast. I appreciate you
[49:30.850 --> 49:35.090]  coming. Dude, do you have an Instagram or something you want people to follow you on?
[49:35.090 --> 49:42.290]  Yeah, LXTRVN. LXTRVN on Instagram. Follow him. He posts a lot of cool pictures of Ghost OG.
[49:43.010 --> 49:47.250]  We might kind of be in a personal friendly competition over growing this Ghost OG.
[49:47.250 --> 49:51.010]  It's kind of fun. So check out his ghost pics and my ghost pics and then leave some comments.
[49:51.010 --> 49:54.530]  All right, guys, now that the show's over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher. Also, big shout out to

[50:42.450 --> 50:46.690]  letting me play their own music, but we'd like something that says iGrow Culture podcast in it.
[50:47.570 --> 50:51.810]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence. Guys, until next time, thanks for listening. Take a fat dab
[50:51.810 --> 50:53.410]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[51:08.850 --> 51:20.610]  Sweet sensamilia, burning in the night. Sweet sensamilia, gonna make you feel right.
[51:20.610 --> 51:32.130]  I remember the day when Jaja showed me the way. It's an irie meditation. It is the only way.
[51:33.090 --> 51:53.790]  Yeah. What's up, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for episode number 43
[51:53.790 --> 51:59.550]  of the iGrow Culture podcast. The podcast all about cannabis news, education, and culture.
[51:59.550 --> 52:02.990]  If you're a new grower, a professional grower, a long time cannabis consumer,
[52:02.990 --> 52:06.830]  a brand new smoker, or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[52:06.830 --> 52:12.030]  this my friends is the podcast for you. Thanks again for joining us. Guys, as promised at the
[52:12.030 --> 52:15.710]  table today is our good friend, King Cola. How are you doing, brother? Good, man. Good. Thanks
[52:15.710 --> 52:19.390]  for having me. Oh man. Thanks a lot for coming. Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule.
[52:20.350 --> 52:23.630]  All these growers are super busy. We're sitting here talking about all the stuff we're doing.
[52:23.630 --> 52:28.030]  How are you doing, Jesse? Pretty good. You looking better this week? Yes. My skin and
[52:28.030 --> 52:32.750]  complexion is the right color. I'm on both feet. Quit making fun of Jesse. He's back. He's on his
[52:32.750 --> 52:37.150]  feet. He took a lot of dabs today. He redeemed himself. He's on his game. Sean brought some
[52:37.150 --> 52:43.230]  solventless. It's delicious. And Jesse did not die. No, not at all. My blood sugar is correct
[52:43.630 --> 52:46.750]  today. I was worried about coming on here with you guys. I'm not a big BHO
[52:47.470 --> 52:51.710]  smoker. I didn't even ask that. I was going to ask that as we were, as the show progressed,
[52:51.710 --> 52:56.670]  I had a BHO question for you. So I was going to see if you're a dabber. I am actually. I grew up
[52:56.670 --> 53:02.190]  with Spencer, man. Come on. But in the same sense, I was pampered. So when you smoke his chatter,
[53:02.190 --> 53:08.430]  you can't really go to smoking a dispensary. So I was just like, screw it. I'll make ice wax.
[53:08.430 --> 53:13.150]  Do you smoke live resin? I've had the pleasure of trying it a couple of times from his personal
[53:13.310 --> 53:19.230]  stash and good gracious. It is amazing, isn't it? It really is. I'd like to steal some of his
[53:20.030 --> 53:24.110]  tech on that one. It's a terpy, terpy, slurpy. By the time this episode airs,
[53:24.830 --> 53:29.710]  in my mind, I feel like Spencer will have won the secret cup. Yeah, I think that's a safe
[53:29.710 --> 53:33.550]  assumption. He's there now. The competition actually happens Sunday night. I think the
[53:33.550 --> 53:38.670]  judging happens. So by the time this episode comes out, he will be the champion of the secret cup
[53:38.670 --> 53:44.190]  and I can reveal what was entered. It was white widow grown by Rasta. Yeah,
[53:44.190 --> 53:47.870]  it's like, oh no, no, you can't. You've looked at me like you can't say that,
[53:47.870 --> 53:51.550]  but this won't come out. This is now that everybody knows now it was white widow grown
[53:51.550 --> 53:56.990]  by Rasta Jeff of I read genetics. It was the cut. Spence gave me the cut a while back. I crossed
[53:56.990 --> 54:00.990]  that cut to grateful dog and I actually made Capleton with it. I love that white widow,
[54:00.990 --> 54:06.510]  dude. It grows like a boss. It kicks out multiple donkey dicks, like menorahs of donkey.
[54:06.910 --> 54:11.630]  It's so awesome. Yeah. So I hope that does well for you. Good luck, brother. I hope you brought
[54:11.630 --> 54:16.110]  home a trophy either way. If he won or not, I plan to get him here on the show. He might be
[54:16.110 --> 54:20.910]  the episode after this, his schedule pending. It's up to him. He's invited. He knows he's welcome
[54:20.910 --> 54:24.590]  anytime. Hopefully we can get him. Shout out. Spence shout out to big D shout out to Jeremy.
[54:24.590 --> 54:28.270]  Shout out everyone involved with the secret cup. We'll do a wrap up on that one in the next show.

[56:34.030 --> 56:39.470]  Jesse just looked at me like we didn't think of that. No, that's cool. We got them in, uh,
[56:39.470 --> 56:46.190]  in stock now too. Nice. We got, and you know, enough to get going there in the store. I just
[56:46.190 --> 56:50.510]  saw you visualize the shelf. He looked up at my wall as if the shelf would be there and he could
[56:50.510 --> 56:55.870]  see it. And I think he counted them. Um, I don't know if it's how many is there or if we're going
[56:55.870 --> 56:59.710]  to get the order by the time to show show. So there's two different numbers going through my
[56:59.710 --> 57:04.030]  head there. Either way they will, they will get your nano lux lighting needs taken care of. They
[57:04.030 --> 57:08.590]  look to be quality lights, uh, much loved all the sponsors. I appreciate it. You guys, thanks for
[57:08.590 --> 57:12.270]  helping us out. If you're interested in sponsoring the show, email me it's a, I grew a culture at
[57:12.270 --> 57:17.950]  hotmail.com and we'll get it going. So I've got a couple of things I got to say a big shout out to
[57:17.950 --> 57:24.350]  Angela, Adam and Mike, dude, you guys trimmed for seven hours last night. Thank you. Uh, I would
[57:24.350 --> 57:27.870]  have gotten nuts without it. Sean just looked over and saw the trimmed pots and shook his head. Those
[57:27.870 --> 57:34.270]  are big pots. I've been at it for like a week. I know good trimmers. If you need them all,
[57:34.270 --> 57:38.110]  they're all give you their numbers. They're yours. They need money. You just got to pay
[57:38.110 --> 57:41.230]  them decently. It's a big shout out to those guys. They helped me out trim and I could not have got
[57:41.230 --> 57:47.230]  through it. Also a big, huge shout out to Hanky B. Uh, Hanky B gave me some live resin to dab.
[57:47.230 --> 57:50.190]  I was hanging out his house and as I left, he was here, man, take some of this. I just gave me like
[57:50.190 --> 57:55.470]  a grandma live res. Uh, make sure you follow him on Instagram. That's hard to say. He's Hanky B11.
[57:55.470 --> 57:59.470]  He told me to make sure I say that cause he gave me a hash. It's a big shout out to Hank. Uh, we'll
[57:59.470 --> 58:04.030]  skip some shout outs for now. That's enough. Let's get onto the meat of the show here. We got a guy
[58:04.670 --> 58:08.590]  that does all kinds of organics and we've been talking about a lot of grow lessons.
[58:08.590 --> 58:12.750]  So I guess the first question to jump right into it, dude, if we just want to get down to it,
[58:12.750 --> 58:18.990]  you want to tell me all about organic as fuck? Uh, yeah, well organic is a fuck is just a hashtag
[58:18.990 --> 58:24.110]  we started using. Um, it's created by like a little closer to you. There you go. I just want
[58:24.110 --> 58:28.670]  to get you well. Oh, you're good. Um, but yeah, Jesse actually started the hashtag and stole it
[58:28.670 --> 58:36.190]  off his page. Um, but no, it's the idea is that, uh, all organic. Um, we don't like the idea of
[58:36.190 --> 58:41.710]  any bottled fertilizers, synthetic nutrients, uh, specifically, you know, pesticides, anything
[58:42.750 --> 58:50.590]  with mineral salts, map and DAP, uh, mono ammonium, um, mono ammonium phosphates, uh, you know,
[58:50.590 --> 58:56.990]  preservatives. There you go. Um, the idea is to create a clean product, um, food grade,
[58:56.990 --> 59:04.190]  everything. I probably buy half of the products I use at our local natural grocers. Uh, so really
[59:04.190 --> 59:10.670]  big emphasis on growing style. Um, that's most growers tend to focus on flour where we focus on
[59:10.670 --> 59:19.790]  the soil. Um, I feel a lot of stuff is lost when you're just focusing on weight, uh, high vegetative
[59:19.790 --> 59:27.870]  yields, uh, you know, quick flowering times. You're just losing a lot of money time. I mean,
[59:27.870 --> 59:32.910]  you're just losing so much in that process. Exactly. And then hurting the environment and
[59:32.910 --> 59:36.670]  a lot of other people. And that's what that part is. What's really got me interested. I want to
[59:36.670 --> 59:40.750]  learn a lot from you to maybe shift my growth toward this style. And my reasoning is the
[59:40.750 --> 59:47.070]  sustainability. Uh, I've got a kid and she's 11 now. And I keep thinking about the stuff that I
[59:47.070 --> 59:53.230]  hear. I read about what they're making my nutrients out of. And then I'm thinking about, uh, I toured
[59:53.230 --> 59:58.430]  a large growth facility that runs a lot of hydro and they have lots of water that has to be flushed
[59:58.430 --> 01:00:02.510]  out as waste. And I thought, where does that go? That's going back to our municipal water supply
[01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:06.030]  and being filtered out. And when you get water out of the sink, that's what we're drinking.
[01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:10.430]  And that really that stuff the past few years has had me think, and I want to get more sustainable
[01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:15.790]  and no offense to the hydro shops, but I love them because they help us out, but we don't need
[01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:20.350]  to be paying overmarked prices for a botanic care bottle because it says botanic care. When
[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:24.590]  Sean can teach us how to take that chicken shit and seabird guano and make something that we can
[01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:29.070]  one day, the end of the world is coming and you can't go to the hydro shop. Then I totally agree.
[01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.430]  Sean's going to outgrow us. Yeah. Sean's going to outgrow all of us when that day comes.
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:37.710]  I do feel hypocritical sometimes because I use very few products from our store as well.
[01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:40.990]  Yeah. But see your store, it has the option.
[01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.870]  Ours is a little different than most I like to think.
[01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:48.190]  I was pretty blown away when I first walked down there and that's coming from a guy who just,
[01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.430]  who absolutely hates hydro stores.
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:56.590]  So you're doing it mostly out of the organics for the clean product, for the food grade. I'm
[01:00:56.590 --> 01:01:01.790]  interested more for the sustainability. I think that's both a great reason to do it. One thing
[01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:06.670]  that got my attention right off the bat, you said you don't use any pesticides or non-organic
[01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:11.310]  pesticides. I'm really curious, and I bet the listeners are too, how do you keep bugs out of
[01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:16.590]  your crop without some nuclear attack? Right at the beginning of the fall here, everybody I know
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:21.630]  got three types of bugs at once. Three letters, I-P-M.
[01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.430]  Can I guess what that means? Ladies and gentlemen, integrated pest management. Please write that down.
[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:30.110]  That's important. We will talk about that a lot. That's going to be a glossary term that you need
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:35.150]  to mark. I-P-M, integrated pest management. Prevention is the only guaranteed form of
[01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:42.430]  pest control. 100%. If you don't want to deal with pests, then you have to start a program.
[01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:48.910]  And that starts with a nice organic base. You want to start out with things high in chitin,
[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:54.670]  insect, frass, crab meal, things, neem cake, all of that into the soil mix. Then you want to start
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:02:03.630]  off on a regimen of silica. What else? Aloe vera. You want to build, you want to strengthen the
[01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:08.030]  plant, help it build its cell walls. Basically, you need to build its immune system so it can
[01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:14.990]  take care of itself. So throw away the bottle of potassium silicates and use the aloe vera and the,
[01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.350]  what was the other one that you said that I felt would really build the cell walls?
[01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:24.830]  The silica. We use, yeah, silica is just such an underutilized thing in growing. And I'm pretty
[01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:29.230]  sure both of you guys can contest to that in synthetics or hydro, organic, whatever.
[01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:33.790]  Build cell walls. It's all the fiber growth. Exactly. And the stronger your leaf wall is,
[01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.270]  the stronger it's going to be able to stand up to attack.
[01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:42.750]  What do you use to get silica in organics? There's a couple of different options on the,
[01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.310]  actually there's thousands of different options on the market. Potassium silica is probably the
[01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:54.270]  number one most common. It's really, you know, that's a good one to use. Most companies sell it,
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:03:00.590]  most organic companies sell it. I personally use silica derived from diatomite through the
[01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:06.430]  majority of my growth. Potassium silicate though does have its place from my clones,
[01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:10.430]  obviously late in flower. I do prefer potassium silicate a little bit more.
[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:15.150]  Is that the stuff that's like in desiccant packs in your box of shoes, new shoes, or
[01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:20.590]  you guys want to talk about it? It sounds like it looks like a familiar, familiar word. Now that I'm
[01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:23.950]  thinking about that, it looks like the same word on there, but I can't promise what it says on the
[01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:27.550]  side of this little pack. I think so. It says desiccant pack on there. Yeah. Well, no, I think
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:34.430]  it says potassium. So it wouldn't surprise me. It's all very common stuff. I mean, and then the
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:39.230]  diatomite and silica derived from diatomite is basically diatomaceous earth, which you're
[01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.870]  probably more familiar with. Got a rough texture. It kind of crushes up the kind of
[01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:46.990]  cuts up the bugs. If they try to get through it, it's like walking on glass for a bug. Okay.
[01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:53.710]  So your plants never get sprayed. Well, actually they do. I, I foliar spray every day. I probably
[01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:59.950]  overkill on my foliar spray. It's, you know, every girl likes to spend time in their garden.
[01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:04.430]  And if you can find a way to do it, yeah, go for it, man. And in my ways to spray.
[01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.270]  So, you know, I do break it down into regiments, shout out to dragonfly earth medicine with their
[01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:16.590]  natural mystic teas of foliar sprays, their soil inoculants and other herbal inoculants. But that's
[01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:24.030]  a big part of my spray regiment. Homemade compost teas, FPJs, FFJs, so fermented fruit juices,
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.270]  fermented plant juices that I make myself. And you're actually spraying that on your plants?
[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:32.030]  Spraying that on the plants. How late into flower would you do that? I usually don't go past week
[01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:38.430]  four or five. Just like a traditional spray. Even though it's organic, things just tend to stick
[01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:43.630]  around. Okay. Yeah. And you can cause problems going past week four or five, I assume.
[01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:50.190]  Exactly. Especially everything that I use is very sugary. You know, fruit juices and plant juices
[01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:55.550]  and everything's got molasses. He, he brought some nugs, you guys. I'm not going to say that I was a
[01:04:55.550 --> 01:05:00.830]  hater of organics, but I feel he stood up for himself before anybody even mentioned it. He said,
[01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:05.630]  I brought this to show you that it's dense and it's odorifficent and it's covered in trichomes
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:09.470]  and it's all of that. The trichomes are actually real. They're not tall. They don't stick off the
[01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:13.870]  bud that he showed me real far, but they're compacted. They're everywhere all over that
[01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:17.950]  nugget. Even between where the two little buds touch on that branch, they're between there.
[01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:22.350]  You got resin everywhere on that. Thanks. So the organics do work. I can see the proof.
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:26.110]  And I'm doing, you know, I do some consulting on the side, but I'm actually working with a couple
[01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:31.470]  of concentrate companies. Shout out Blood Diamond Extracts. They're really killing the game right
[01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:41.070]  now. Yeah. Rocky Mountain Natural Farming. You can check us out on Instagram, but a lot of these
[01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:46.190]  guys, you know, they're making BHO and it's funny. You have your little meme on the internet of,
[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:52.350]  says he grows vegan and can only smokes BHO. But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of guys out there
[01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:57.470]  who will back me on this one saying organics produce better hash. I feel the trichomes more
[01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:03.230]  fully developed. You, your membrane is more intact. You're not going to get that mush. I see
[01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:08.430]  it a lot, especially when making the ice wax. As you can see, this is some stuff that's locally
[01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:13.710]  grown. Or actually here's a better, I think I smoked this the other night. One of your buddies
[01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:19.710]  had some of this. I actually made it for him. Okay. This is, I believe it's organically grown.
[01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.310]  But in the sense that, you know, you probably went to the store and bought some organics.
[01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.990]  Organic soup. Exactly. And then you can look at this one.
[01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:31.150]  It still has a nice smell. A lot of the solvents, it kind of loses the odor in my opinion.
[01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:36.830]  And it's still got that dank smell. But I believe that the, that maybe the,
[01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:40.670]  it's degrading a little quicker. So, you know, check the quality of that one.
[01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:45.070]  Yeah. I like this. I like this one a lot. And check that one. Oh, this one. I hit this one.
[01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:51.470]  This one is tasty. Who did you say made this? That was made by trichome heavy extracts.
[01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:57.390]  Shout out to jibs and grown by growing Kush one mile high. Shout out Rob. He was just
[01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:01.870]  killing the game right now. I walked into the first cannabis cup. Nobody
[01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:06.350]  knew who I read genetics was. I hadn't put my face on Instagram yet. And I had my shirt on
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:10.510]  and growing Kush one mile high spotted me right away. And he goes, dude, your I read genetics,
[01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.830]  come here and took a picture with me and posted it to Instagram. And now my face was out. That's
[01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.590]  what did it. That's what put my face on Instagram. That's when I was like, well, I'm the tall guy
[01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:21.390]  with dreadlocks. That's how it goes. I remember that.
[01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:28.590]  He's a very humble dude. If you want to get your genetics out there, get him to grow it.
[01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:29.870]  Tell you that much. I like that.
[01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.870]  He kills it. Cool. At growing Kush one mile high. Email me, bro.
[01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:37.950]  You're getting a seat. Some stuff should be ready.
[01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:40.350]  A couple of them. Some stuff should be ready here in a couple
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:44.750]  of weeks. If everything goes well. Do you think that you were, I'm going to kind of back loop
[01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:48.910]  here. You said that the trichomes have a better, the trichome heads have a better casing from
[01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:53.150]  organics. Do you think that it's because we're using what the plant actually wants instead of
[01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:56.830]  feeding it junk food out of a bottle? Exactly. I feel a little synthetic
[01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:02.830]  approaches. Like you said, junk food is just such an appropriate term. Your buds are going to get
[01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.510]  denser. They're going to get bigger. They're going to get fatter. Does that necessarily mean
[01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:12.590]  they're any better? No. I mean, it's only better for your wallet. Exactly. And we're fortunate
[01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:18.110]  enough to be in an industry or at a point in this industry where maybe that doesn't matter as much
[01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:24.750]  anymore. So now that people aren't all obsessed with hitting, you know, seven pounds per light,
[01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:29.470]  we can focus a little bit more on quality. What strain was that?
[01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:38.990]  We were trimming last night and there was one plant and that's a perfect example. One plant
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.870]  kicked out donkey dicks the size of my arms. And then the Girl Scout cookies had little popcorn,
[01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:48.190]  but there was as much resin on that little popcorn of Girl Scout cookies as there was
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:54.590]  spread amongst that entire other plant. It was so dank. That little cookies plant is just coated.
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:09:00.030]  I'd rather grow more of those. If I didn't have picky patients, if my patients weren't demanding
[01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:04.030]  of the Grateful Dog and other strains, I'd grow all cookies just because the resin it puts out.
[01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:08.990]  I'd grow cookies, Yeti and SFE. Yeah, there'd be some Grateful Dog in there,
[01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:13.390]  but I'd definitely have like a 36 light room of just cookies. Cookies. Yeah.
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:20.110]  I may, I kind of want to mention things, but I don't want to say too much. I am in the process
[01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:30.350]  of possibly taking on a bad-ass position running 227 lights. Do it. If everything works out within
[01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:38.350]  the next month, I will be in there growing under 227 Govitas. Hell yeah. I'm a little stoked. It's
[01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:45.550]  all hydro tables. It's going to be fun. All right. So better trichome heads because of organics.
[01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:49.150]  Does the aloe vera have anything to do with that, you think? The same way it makes my skin
[01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:55.390]  more supple and doesn't burn under the sun or under the grow light? Yeah. I mean, you can really
[01:09:55.390 --> 01:10:02.270]  go into the properties of aloe and yucca and the saponin and all of that stuff. That's, you know,
[01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:06.750]  30 minutes worth of conversation. But bottom line is, is it increases the health of your plant.
[01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:14.030]  Silica, aloe, coconut water. Those are the bases outside of that. I'm glad you say that. Cause I
[01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.590]  preach those products other than the, the silica. I'm always about aloe and coconut water. I teach
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:25.310]  a lot of people that. So it's a necessity. The coconut water. Yeah. I drink coconut water
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:29.870]  myself and I feel amazing when I drink it. Yeah. And you know, with the style of gardening that I
[01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:35.390]  use, I like the idea that me and my plants share the same food. You know, the more I grow and the
[01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:41.150]  more I evolve into this, I think my plants, I was a vegetarian before I grew. I took decent care of
[01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:45.550]  myself, but I think learning about the plant biology has made me take better care of myself.
[01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:49.390]  And it's influenced my shopping when I go to vitamin cottage or whatever grocery store I hit.
[01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:54.750]  And Jesse has done it too. His organic practices have influenced my shopping and my eating a little
[01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.830]  bit. And it's, which in turn has affected my growing. Cause now you're here to teach me how
[01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:04.030]  to be more healthy, more sustainable. So I see it going full circle. It's, there's a passion there.
[01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:09.390]  I like it. I feel like people maybe put a little bit too much emphasis on the switch. I mean,
[01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:13.550]  if you're running soilless and you're running botanic care, you're almost there. That's what
[01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:19.310]  I'm saying. Yeah. I'm just scared, dude. I, my patients love what I do and I've got, I've got
[01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:23.470]  grateful dog grown to perfection, you know, with, with the way I do it. And I'm, I didn't get it
[01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:27.470]  that way with a few strains, but it's a big jump for me to just go change, but I may do it. I'm
[01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:32.750]  going to write down what you do and kind of, and I can, people will probably disagree with me on
[01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:37.710]  this, but I don't think you're going to lose yield. I swear up and down that this whole
[01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:44.670]  organics yields less is just a misconception in the industry. I mean, it really is. Unfortunately,
[01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:49.550]  you do have people, it's a different approach than traditional gardening. So you've got guys
[01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:54.510]  out there have been doing hydro or soilless mixes for years, switching to super soils and
[01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:59.310]  burning their plants and all organics doesn't yield anything, but it reflects a lot on the
[01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:03.790]  grower. Also. I think somebody like you could definitely just take off with it, especially
[01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:09.310]  with your experience with additives. That's the key. With organics, you start a base. A lot of
[01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:14.110]  people like to water never or water every time. I'm sorry. They don't use anything but water. Me
[01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:18.350]  personally, I like to water never. And that's kind of your style now where you're giving it
[01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:23.470]  I don't know all the product name, but you're giving them silica and you're giving them yucca
[01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:28.110]  and you're giving them everything that I am just, just in a liquid bottle. I'm good at the lazy way.
[01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:32.590]  And you know how most of that stuff is made is it's a compost tea. And then, so they make like
[01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:38.350]  a compost tea and then they basically they'll arrest fermentation. So they stop and kill all
[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:43.230]  the living organisms in there, run it through a protein skimmer, bottle it up and then sell it to
[01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:48.670]  you. So just cut out the middleman. There you go. Make it yourself. There we go. By the summer guys,
[01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:52.430]  we should all be making our own newts when it's warm and we're in Colorado. I'm not going out in
[01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:56.430]  the backyard and doing it this week, but I got a garage. If I had some space by the summer, we'll
[01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.750]  get it going. We'll all be growing organic. Let's get away. We have to support the hydro shops. Go
[01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.950]  buy the organics there. Get the stuff that's in the box, the blood meal, the bone meal things.
[01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:09.390]  If you're doing that, get your worm castings and stuff, wherever you eat locally. Yeah. Go,
[01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:13.710]  go to high grow and make sure that when you're mixing your soil, talk to Jesse about that. Cause
[01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:17.790]  he can fill you in on the whole bone meal and blood meal thing. I'm pretty sure Jesse loves
[01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:20.910]  to talk to people at high grow. He loves to just stand there and get paid to talk to him.
[01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.990]  It's better than a advanced, but you know,
[01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:30.750]  bone meal and blood meal can be approved upon as well. So exactly. And this goes back to the,
[01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:36.670]  the veganics we were kind of talking about before the show, uh, by no means do I claim to be a V
[01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:42.350]  and a grower. We use a hashtag called beyond veganics to kind of poke fun at it. Uh, just for
[01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:46.910]  the simple fact, vegan growing is kind of funny. Just like vegans are right.
[01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:52.910]  How do you know someone's a vegan? Don't worry. They'll tell you.
[01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:59.630]  Exactly. And that's really how it is is, you know, these vegan, these veganic growers are,
[01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:04.110]  they're using just bottled nutrients. I mean, you know, it's just plain and simple. And if
[01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.110]  they're not, they're really depriving their plants of certain things they could be using.
[01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.470]  Earthworm castings, for example, like I know people,
[01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:13.950]  Hey, there's a nice little shout out you can get right there.
[01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:20.350]  Jay, uh, Rocky Mount earthworm castings. Um, I know Jesse uses it. Uh, I use it. Um,
[01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:26.510]  they're super high quality. Um, he is killing the game right now. Dedicated his life to making,
[01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:30.430]  uh, castings for people like me and Jesse. I've heard a lot of good things.
[01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:36.190]  If you're a customer at my store and you use, uh, earthworm castings, ask me for them.
[01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.070]  Yes. Do that.
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:43.870]  Do, um, you know, as a organic grower, uh, I've been in Colorado for about two years now. Um,
[01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.310]  before then I grew, is that all I've known you bros two years? It's only been two years.
[01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:51.790]  Seems like it's been a long time. Right on. Time flies. Um, but no, so, uh, you know,
[01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:56.910]  I have a degree in horticulture. I'm from North Carolina, obviously. Uh, but back there I grew
[01:14:56.910 --> 01:15:02.910]  also, uh, it was organically, um, small scale, but yeah, I've been doing teas and soil mixes
[01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:10.190]  for a while. Uh, coming out here really opened my eyes to the fact that, you know, you think
[01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:14.110]  you're going to come out to Colorado. You think you're going to grow organics. You think it's
[01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:20.830]  this big popular thing, but it's all about money. Um, but you know, Jay, I met Jay, um, and then he
[01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:25.630]  had the high quality, these high quality castings. I've never turned back, met him probably within a
[01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:32.270]  month of being here. I've been using his castings ever since. Uh, he does all testings on his stuff.
[01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:35.470]  You know, it's super high quality and that's really...
[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:36.990]  I posted some today actually.
[01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:42.990]  Yeah. And that's really the key to, uh, basically what I do is my castings. Um, and plain and simple,
[01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:47.550]  everybody wants to know how do I do it? It's Jay's castings. Without a microbial inoculate,
[01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:54.190]  not microbial source, I couldn't do what I do. Um, a lot of people source, you know,
[01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:59.470]  wrigglers, then bat, worm castings from stores. You know, you can make your own compost. It's
[01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:04.030]  probably the best way to do it. Your own worm castings is probably the best way to do it. But
[01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:08.830]  at the same time, a lot of people, I call it greenwashing. Um, they go out and they buy
[01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:12.830]  something because it looks organic or it looks like it's, you know, going to be...
[01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:14.510]  All natural.
[01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:20.190]  Exactly. Like this, this environmental friendly product. And these companies are preying on the
[01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:25.550]  consumer just like they would in any other, you know, organic companies aren't any nicer than
[01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:30.830]  synthetic companies. Uh, there's a company right now, for example, that loves to kick out this,
[01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:35.070]  they throw numbers at people and you, uh, your average grower doesn't really understand
[01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:41.710]  how these work. But for example, like Jesse was saying, uh, Jay actually posted something earlier,
[01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:47.390]  um, about the worm castings. I'm sorry, I wanted to bring this up.
[01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:49.310]  No, check it out. Do your research. I like it.
[01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:55.150]  Um, but no, for example, so you've got a company out there who's throwing this number around like
[01:16:55.150 --> 01:17:03.230]  30,000 plus microbe, you know, living microbes in your tea and you can use it and multiply it.
[01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:07.710]  And, you know, it sounds amazing. It really does. And then you read Jay's test and it's like, uh,
[01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:16.750]  6.9 million, uh, protozoa in one gram of material. So in one pound, that's over 3 billion protozoa.
[01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:22.030]  That's before you multiply it in your brewer. So to everybody out there that's using these,
[01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:25.950]  these products, you know, these sales pitches, uh, I'm sorry.
[01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:29.390]  There's still a need to shake. You're getting seeds and stems.
[01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.790]  Exactly. You know, you're, you think you're getting a leg up, but really you're paying
[01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:38.990]  for an overpriced, price brewer and somebody to put stuff in a bag for you. That's all you're
[01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:42.110]  paying when the bottle is a lot like clothes. We're paying for the label. You're paying for
[01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:45.630]  that Nike symbol, that Botanic Care symbol, that advanced nutrients logo.
[01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:51.950]  Yeah. So shout out to Jay. He's doing it big and not only worm castings. Um, he can source a lot
[01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:58.350]  of things that, you know, grow stores can't get. Uh, Jesse can probably attend to that. There's a
[01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:03.950]  lot of things that they're just not going to be able to source. He approaches it a little
[01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:08.030]  differently. And you know, that's, that's cool. Yeah. And once you get to a certain scale,
[01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:14.030]  it's time to adjust from being a garage basement, attic grower to actually being a horticulturalist
[01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:18.350]  and setting up a grow and doing horticulture. That's kind of what it sounds like. That's what
[01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:21.950]  Jay's more aimed for. Yeah. So you got Neem meal up there?
[01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:26.990]  Yeah. He can get whatever you want. Yeah. I'm going to put Neem meal in my, here's a weird
[01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:32.030]  question. I'm going to feed Botanic Care. Will it kill my Neem meal if I put it in my soil before I
[01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:38.830]  mix? No, you got to, the only reason you really have to be careful mixing synthetics and organics
[01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:45.550]  is you can really throw off your microherd. Um, you feed too much of something, your fungus is
[01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:49.310]  going to feed at a faster rate than your bacteria, which will kill your bacteria out. Then
[01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:55.390]  your fungus will actually start to pull things from the plant if it's not in the soil. So it's
[01:18:55.390 --> 01:19:00.350]  a balancing act. Uh, there's a couple of people I've seen on Instagram who are just absolutely
[01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:07.150]  killing the balancing act with the synthetics and organics. I would never recommend it to anybody.
[01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.550]  That's something we talked about in the last show is don't mix.
[01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:15.310]  Stay away. Unless you were just extremely well versed in what you do. I would highly
[01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:19.790]  recommend staying away from running synthetics and organics at the same time.
[01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:27.390]  I know a guy that amends his, uh, uh, cocoa soil and he's running full blown, uh, uh,
[01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:32.190]  general hydroponics and all that. Yeah. These probiotic guys. Now I've seen a lot of them
[01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:36.590]  running cocoa. That's probiotic farmers alliance is getting crazy. It's killing me. I think everybody
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:40.990]  at this table knows there's one grower. He runs organics all the way until about week six and
[01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:46.670]  then he starts just pummeling with like hammerhead and all kinds of ridiculous PGRs just to make them
[01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:51.470]  explode. And he said that gives it the flavor that's his, but you know, I'm just teaching.
[01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.910]  Yeah. That's his grow. He can do what he wants in there. Just don't sell it to me.
[01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:59.630]  I heard they didn't make that stuff anymore. You know, they don't, but I know it's called like
[01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:04.990]  Bushmaster or something. If you're putting it out, there are two or three bottles on the shelf at
[01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:09.790]  high grow, indoor growing supplies. If you use hammerhead, did I, I don't use it anymore. I did
[01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:13.550]  use it in the past when I was a new grower. I tried every brand and I tried hammerhead. That
[01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:18.590]  shit made my buds larger. I'll say it. Uh, if you're an advanced nutrients grower or a hydro
[01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:22.750]  farmer and you want to clean that shit off the shelf at Jesse shop, go get it. It's $107 a bottle.
[01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:28.510]  That's not that much. I'll make you do it for a whole bunch of advanced nutrients.
[01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:32.750]  There we go. Advances on really good sale right now. Yeah. I grow indoor growing supplies.
[01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:36.510]  Listen to the agriculture show. Speaking of advanced, I had something written down. We've
[01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:40.350]  already gone a half hour guys with this show, maybe a little longer than an hour if nobody minds.
[01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:45.710]  Um, why don't you guys, I'm going to take a dab and I'm going to, this is, I'm lying. I'm starting
[01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:51.230]  to fight right now. Tell me a little bit about PGRs and how you feel about them. I'm going to,
[01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:55.310]  I'm going to jump in real quickly. PGR stands for plant growth regulator, you guys. And now
[01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:59.950]  I'm going to let Sean tell us about those while I take a dab. Uh, there's a time and place for
[01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:08.030]  everything, man. Um, not in my food crops, at least not, uh, synthetically made PGRs. There's
[01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:14.110]  obviously plenty of ways to use natural PGRs, plant hormones, uh, gibberellic acid, tree of
[01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:21.070]  Canton, all, uh, gibberellic acid, gibberellic acid. You know, it goes on after the show. Yeah.
[01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:27.790]  I got a buttload of that stuff. You know, alfalfa. I do raw alfalfa barley sprouts.
[01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:33.310]  Yeah. Barley sprouts. Barley tea every two weeks on my veg plants. Yeah. I always actually
[01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:38.830]  alternate, uh, alfalfa and barley for veg and then corn and barley for flour. I haven't used
[01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:46.270]  corn yet, but that's just cause I haven't found a, I mean, I know, uh, 95% really cool. Organic.
[01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:54.590]  It's not that expensive. Oh no, no. That's, um, I've been, yeah. Learning that, you know,
[01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:59.630]  a lot of cool little additives you don't find at growth stores. Although I'm going to start
[01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:05.550]  having ferments, ferments, ferments, ferments, like cold processed extractions. That's how
[01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:11.630]  you're going to get your natural PGRs. Um, fermented plant juices. Uh, basically you're
[01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:16.190]  going to collect growing nodes. Can you teach us what a PGR actually is? Kind of explain like what
[01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:22.270]  it is and what it does. Let's say like what a axiom. Are you familiar with that? Yeah. So explain
[01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:28.110]  that to people. So basically, uh, basically what a PGR is, is, uh, it controls the plant's growth.
[01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:34.350]  Um, so it contains either real or synthetic forms of plant hormones. Uh, and then it's going to
[01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:40.590]  make the plant react in a certain way, usually by triggering like apical dominance or
[01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:47.550]  stimulating the plants, uh, SAR. There's different ways that these PGRs can affect the plants, but
[01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:52.830]  for the most part, uh, you're just applying it to the plant at a certain stage in its growth
[01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:58.110]  cycle to make it do what you want. You're just manipulating nature. So the most popular one,
[01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:01.950]  I think that a lot of us have used in the past would be Snowstorm, Snowstorm Ultra.
[01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:07.070]  Uh, it's basically, they've taken, I think it's sea kelp and other plant proteins and
[01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:13.070]  concentrated them. Uh, why don't I want to feed that to my plants? And I'm just being,
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:16.830]  I'm just trying to, so that we can get the listeners. And the thing is, is a lot of those,
[01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:20.830]  you know, I can't really tell you without looking at the bottle, uh, what exactly is in it, but if
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:27.150]  you're telling me it's the kelp, um, me personally, my favorite flower hardener back when I used to
[01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:32.910]  use bottled organics was, uh, what is it? Mindo Avalanche, Mendocino Avalanche, um, which is
[01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:37.550]  basically two different types of kelp and molasses. Uh, so that I've actually kind of
[01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:41.310]  adapted that to my... Nick Jones- So just replace the bottled crap and use kelp and molasses.
[01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:46.030]  Just make the real deal. Natural healthy PGRs versus...
[01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:52.030]  Nick Jones- Exactly. And that goes right back into, uh, the fermented, like plant juices,
[01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:56.350]  extracts is the way to go. It's basically the same idea as if you want to, if a human wants
[01:23:56.350 --> 01:24:00.430]  to get ripped, you shouldn't go inject steroids and sit on the couch. You should go to the gym,
[01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:05.310]  eat protein, eat vegetables, get all the things you need and work out. Uh, we're not giving our
[01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:10.670]  plants a workout. We're feeding them, uh, energy bars and protein shakes and treating them like
[01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:16.190]  shit and expecting them to be fully healthy. We need balanced, healthy plants, not just steroid
[01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:20.910]  boosted plants. They use PGRs. It's so funny. Like Axiom is one of the best, uh... Nick Jones-
[01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:24.910]  I've used lots of it. Not on my personal stuff, but I've seen the results of it.
[01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:29.390]  Just the idea of it is, you know, you're using this synthetic to stimulate the plant's SAR.
[01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:31.630]  Nick Jones- Which, what is it?
[01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:36.190]  It's a, is it systematic automated response? The first word might be off.
[01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:37.070]  Nick Jones- I'm not even sure.
[01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:42.190]  Yeah, it's, it's some sort of automated response. Basically it's the plant's ability to protect
[01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:47.310]  itself. Um, and it's defense mode. That's the reason, you know, the plant produces resin is to
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:52.830]  protect itself basically. Uh, and that's kind of what Axiom does is it stimulates
[01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:57.230]  that chain reaction inside of the plant. So it's going into defense mode.
[01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:58.430]  Nick Jones- It almost stresses the plant.
[01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:02.830]  It's exactly what it's doing is it's, uh, chemically stressing the plant. Uh, you have
[01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.470]  to be careful. Uh, you know, Jessica probably contended this when you're messing with gibberellic
[01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:11.950]  acid and stuff. I get a lot of Fox tailing, uh, when I kind of use it later into flower.
[01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:14.350]  And that's usually with any PGR. Um,
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:18.510]  Nick Jones- Wasn't a gibberellic acid at one point was a
[01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:20.910]  choice for people creating feminine seeds.
[01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:21.390]  Yeah.
[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:23.230]  Nick Jones- It makes them too stretchy.
[01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:23.710]  Really?
[01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:29.790]  Nick Jones- Yeah. I've found, uh, uh, silver thiosulfate that I make myself is the best way
[01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:30.830]  for reversing.
[01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:33.870]  I was meeting some with some old heads this morning. They were talking about colloidal
[01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:35.390]  silver and cloning.
[01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:42.190]  Nick Jones- Man, if you're going to reverse seeds, definitely make your own silver thiosulfate at
[01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:43.230]  home. It's really easy to do.
[01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:45.630]  Make everything at home. It's really easy to do.
[01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:46.030]  Nick Jones- Yeah.
[01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:47.710]  And just,
[01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:51.390]  Nick Jones- I mean, if we're not, if you guys, I'm going to kind of apologize. Also,
[01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:56.110]  if you live in an apartment, if you're a new grower, uh, if you're not, if you're not striving
[01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:59.390]  for what we are, don't, don't feel bad. Use your bottles, do what you can. If you're a medical
[01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:03.710]  patient and you don't have the physical ability to mix this shit up, we're not hating you. We're
[01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:05.310]  just recommending, we're encouraging.
[01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:09.150]  Nick Jones- No, and reach out to us because we, we definitely have ways that we could help you.
[01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:14.190]  Nick Jones- Um, you know, if you, if you live in an apartment, if you are unable to mix your
[01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:17.390]  soil and make your own teas, there are definitely options out there for you.
[01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:20.350]  Nick Jones- Um, see that stuff community on the podcast.
[01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:21.150]  Nick Jones- Yeah.
[01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:22.510]  And everybody deserves that.
[01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.790]  Nick Jones- We'll get in Jess's awesome ass truck and we'll drive up your mountain and
[01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:29.310]  we'll come mix up soil in your yard for you and we'll put it in pots and we'll carry it
[01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:32.270]  in and hopefully you can get your wheelchair between the plants to water them.
[01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.470]  Nick Jones- Yeah. I mean, I feel like people-
[01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:34.190]  Yeah, we'll get you going.
[01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:38.270]  Nick Jones- Yeah, but I think people kind of overcomplicate things with organics. Um,
[01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:42.670]  basically if you, if you want to grow organics or start growing organics, I'd recommend going
[01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:47.790]  and finding a nice and organic bottled line of nutrients, roots organic, general organic, age
[01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:51.150]  old organics. Um, you know, the list goes on and on and they're-
[01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:52.270]  Uh, bio, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:52.910]  Nick Jones- Bio biz.
[01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:53.470]  Bio biz.
[01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:54.270]  That's good stuff too.
[01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.750]  Nick Jones- I, I, uh-
[01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:55.630]  It's pretty simple stuff too.
[01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:55.950]  Nick Jones- Yeah.
[01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.550]  Their, uh, fish hydro slate is very good.
[01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.950]  Nick Jones- Okay.
[01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:06.190]  Um, yeah, I used to use it when I was back in the dizzy, but, uh, anyways, uh, I'd recommend
[01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:12.270]  picking up a nice bottled organic nutrient line. Uh, then outside of that, go and get you some nice
[01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:18.670]  Rocky Mount worm casting style worm castings. Uh, they, the quality is extremely important.
[01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:24.910]  I cannot stress that enough. Um, find high quality worm castings or find a high quality
[01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:28.910]  microbial source. Um, and then molasses. There's your compost tea.
[01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:34.910]  Sean is pretty much, uh, uh, describing the, uh, the way I grow.
[01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.310]  Yeah. We're supposed to call him something different the whole time.
[01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.430]  Like, keep saying your name, bro.
[01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:44.350]  That's, that's basically the way I grow inside. And, uh, I can promise you,
[01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:50.750]  it's, you get stellar results and it's, um, you know, it's way better than hydro. That's for
[01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:51.070]  damn sure.
[01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:56.110]  And you're just replacing, uh, you know, synthetics have chelates. Um, and that's
[01:27:56.110 --> 01:28:02.190]  kind of the idea of using the tea with your organic bottled nutrient is when you feed with
[01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:06.190]  your tea, when you feed with the nutrient, you're putting it in the soil. When you're feeding with
[01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:11.310]  your tea, you're activating that soil to help it eat those nutrients, to give it back into your
[01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.470]  plant.
[01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:13.470]  That's a really good way to put that. It's a great way to.
[01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:18.430]  Yeah. So if you're, if you're growing with bottled organic nutrients and you're not using a tea
[01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.670]  of some, some sort of microbial source, you're, you're just hurting yourself. Plain and simple.
[01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:26.430]  Uh, I have a couple of questions written down for you and stuff. Will you give us a quick run
[01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:31.470]  through, um, five gallon bucket on how to make a nice, Jesse's done this for us, but will you
[01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:36.110]  tell us how to make a nice microbial tea for just to start off with that we can use almost any time?
[01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:42.910]  Okay. So, uh, yeah, without a doubt, uh, worm castings and molasses, if you can't get anything
[01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:48.910]  else, just those two, um, and there's your microbial source and there's a food for it, uh,
[01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:54.270]  depending on your quality of castings, a fourth of cup per gallon, uh, molasses, depending on
[01:28:54.270 --> 01:29:00.590]  how often you're using it, one teaspoon to one tablespoon per gallon. Um, outside of that kelp
[01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:05.150]  meal is always a good one. Uh, kelp meal. I mean, if you're not familiar with the benefits of kelp,
[01:29:05.150 --> 01:29:09.870]  you should really look it up. Plenty of plant hormones. There's a decent MPK value in there.
[01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:17.150]  Um, and then really go crazy, uh, just molasses, earthworm castings. Then you can go into kelp.
[01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:22.030]  You can go into alfalfa depending on, you know, veg, flour, that's how you're going to kind of
[01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:28.350]  deliver more of an MPK value to your plant. Um, do you agree with the revs, uh, the revs book,
[01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:34.110]  uh, true living organics? You know, I shout out to the rev. I read his book, uh, you know,
[01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:39.870]  the rev sub I grew up learning organics just like everybody else did. And I really don't agree
[01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:45.710]  with his stuff. Unfortunately. I mean, it's, but I learned everything that I know now from his book.
[01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:50.430]  You know, it's, if it, if I wouldn't have went through that trial, I wouldn't be where I am
[01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:54.830]  today. So I can't be mad at him. You just have to work, learn what works for you. I know people
[01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:59.630]  who have used his stuff with great success. Okay. So he's not saying to skip it. No, definitely.
[01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:05.310]  I want to read that book. I've seen some people crush it and have amazing buds with super soil.
[01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:10.270]  And I've seen other people have burnt up shitty buds with super soil. So it's kind of, it's how
[01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:16.910]  you grow. Yeah. People, you know, it's, people are really funny about organics. Uh, we, even with my
[01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:21.550]  Rocky mountain natural farming page, we kind of had to take a break with posts for a while. Um,
[01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:26.750]  we like to put in for informative posts up trying to help the community, but, uh,
[01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:31.550]  we're met with a lot of defiance. Oh, as soon as you put up, I quit posting a lot of stuff on
[01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:35.150]  Facebook because as soon as you put up a helpful thing, 10 people tell you why you're stupid.
[01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:40.030]  Exactly. And you know, to each his own, you don't have to agree with the way I grew up.
[01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:46.590]  Even if I say something wrong, sure. I mean, it's a lot easier for you to focus on one point. I got
[01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:51.630]  a lot of stuff I got to remember. I've actually made mistakes on this podcast and I felt proud
[01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:56.270]  to come back and say, Hey guys, last week I told you the wrong way. I'm sorry. Like Jesse called
[01:30:56.270 --> 01:31:01.390]  me. He's like, you just said this. Oh shit. I did say that. But I feel like people are getting
[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:07.470]  too caught up in a, this growing style or that growing style or he grows like this or they grow
[01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:13.710]  like that. And it's just, people need to choose their own information. It's amateurish in my
[01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:19.390]  opinion. Exactly. Bro science. All three of us, all three of us grow different ways. You don't
[01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:23.870]  see us fight like children, you know, we all, but we all borrow something from each other.
[01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:27.230]  I'm sure you've learned something and you've learned something from me and I've learned five
[01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:32.750]  things from you and five from you. We're all still doing the same thing. I love talking to
[01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:38.030]  synthetic growers. Um, I've, I've never grown marijuana synthetically. Uh, my background is
[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:44.830]  in commercial agriculture. I've grown millions and millions of GMO, horrible, horrible synthetic
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.870]  plants. Um, I'm not proud of it. Food crops, food crops, all edible food. I mean, you can look on
[01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:56.990]  my Instagram and see him. Oh yeah. Uh, thousands. We was 30 acres of glass greenhouses. We, um,
[01:31:56.990 --> 01:32:01.790]  people got to eat, but you know, there's a certain point in time that you've got to kind of
[01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:06.910]  figure out what means more to you. Is it your money or your morals? I walked away from making
[01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:14.670]  $45,000 a year, which is, you know, it's a good bit for me as a student loans, man. But, uh,
[01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:18.430]  no, you know, I walked away from that and got a part-time job here in town working at a hydro
[01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:23.390]  store and just grew because you know, it's, that's what I wanted to do. And I couldn't,
[01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:25.790]  it's a lot easier to wake up and look at yourself in the mirror.
[01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:30.910]  That's why I started a seed company because I got tired. Well, that's, that's kind of what led to
[01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:35.070]  it, but that's how I ended up self-employed. I don't want to work for somebody all day for
[01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:41.150]  something I don't support for a minimum wage and hate myself. I'd rather be kind of struggling and
[01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:46.030]  really happy and have a cool job and have a cool job. And I've got everything I want. I got a cool
[01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:50.270]  ass girlfriend. I can do what I want. I got a seed company. If I, and I'm not rich. I think if I
[01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:53.950]  were rich, I'd just be depressed and confused on all this money. And I wouldn't know if you guys
[01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:57.470]  are my friends because I'm rich or because you guys are cool as shit. And we're brothers. I'd
[01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.830]  be like, these guys just want to come smoke on my live resin. Cause I've got an ounce of it in my
[01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:06.750]  pocket. I think I've got, we're, we're our rich. We're rich this way because we make, we make the,
[01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:10.750]  we know that we're not poisoning people. We're growing a quality product. We're contributing.
[01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:14.670]  We're moving it forward. We're making the cannabis a good thing instead of a scary thing.
[01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:20.270]  I walked away from a $25 an hour job. Well, they asked me to leave, but
[01:33:22.190 --> 01:33:29.470]  I walked away. They actually told me I had to quit smoking weed and I said, no. So,
[01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:34.590]  but yeah, and a lot of people will tell you that that's way happier, but you have to choose the
[01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:39.470]  decisions that make yet happiness over money is way important. I don't drink a fifth of whiskey
[01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:44.670]  every night now. Oh man. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to sobriety. I haven't had alcohol in a long time.
[01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:49.790]  And it feels so good. I still enjoy beer, but I don't know if I'm really, really good at drinking
[01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:54.190]  or really, really bad at it. I'm not sure which one it is, but either way, I'm not a big person
[01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:59.710]  as you can tell, like one beer wasted. Wow. Biggest lightweight. Now I bet you two beers
[01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:05.470]  would crush me now. Yeah. I'd be silly sitting in the corner. Let's see. I wanted, you kind of told
[01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:09.710]  me earlier, what is your average harvest weight per thousand watt light running your organics?
[01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:17.550]  Um, you know, it varies. So last round we ran with the kind of like the style Jesse was talking about,
[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:23.550]  uh, with the, just a bottled nutrient kind of, or a bottled organic supplemented with teas.
[01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:33.150]  We were hitting around, I say 1.7 pounds per light. Um, this last grow, um, which is what I
[01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:37.870]  brought you today was grown with no bottled nutrients. Absolutely none. I mean, this is all
[01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:44.510]  fruit juices, plant juices, the calcium. And I think I probably run a pretty mild soil too,
[01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:51.390]  compared to like TLO or superfluid. Yeah. I don't, I really, uh, go light on my soil mix. I think
[01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:55.470]  over mending is a big problem. That's what's really impressed me about that jar you got there.
[01:34:55.470 --> 01:35:00.190]  So I know your, your soil mix is almost minimal. So I'm holding the butt up to the microphone,
[01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:08.190]  but it's not loud enough. Yeah. So we hit a, I hit probably 1.2. I'm not done pulling yet.
[01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:12.030]  I'll text you with a final weight and you can throw it up on a later show. But yes,
[01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:16.910]  right now I'm kind of looking at 1.2, but that's with no bottled nutrients. Um, and these are new
[01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:22.670]  strains that I'm running this round. So do you have a favorite strain to grow? Um, you know,
[01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:28.270]  I'm still, so I still feel so like new to the growing game. Um, you know, growing back East
[01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:33.390]  and kind of growing what you have to, you get out here and, you know, so I guess flow would
[01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:37.070]  probably be my favorite strain. That's a great question. She loves to take good pictures too.
[01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:42.030]  Yeah. Um, outside of the flow Citrex, I think we were talking about that earlier. That one is
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:48.430]  definitely going to be in the garden for a long, long time. Uh, yeah. Outside of that, I've grown,
[01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:52.430]  I've had a pleasure to grow on some of your gear. I've grown the grateful dog, the heart of gold,
[01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:56.990]  Lemon Jeffrey. Nice. I think the heart of gold was my personal favorite. Um, it was
[01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:03.550]  racy to say the least. I mean, it's, it's not like you wake up in the middle of the night and
[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:10.830]  you accidentally grab that to put you back to sleep. You fucked up. No, not at all. That's
[01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:15.150]  the golden goat in there. The golden goat is definitely Sativa heavy. Um, I wish I had taken
[01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:20.670]  it like a week longer than I, how long did you let it go? Uh, I think I cut it at like nine.
[01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:24.110]  Okay. Yeah. That's good to know. So yeah, I think about 10 weeks is usually what I recommend.
[01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:33.150]  And it took once at 76, 77 days once. Nice. I think probably 72 as far as I go.
[01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:39.870]  So DJ shorts been preaching this 1113 light cycle. So I tried it. Oh man. Sean had a reaction right
[01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:43.150]  away. I'm glad I decided to go that route. I had a couple of things written down a couple of ways
[01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:48.030]  to go. So I'm glad I went that way. Um, I'll tell you my experience, but what did you think about it?
[01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:53.470]  Ah, confusion, man. I just, a little bit of information is a dangerous thing.
[01:36:56.110 --> 01:37:01.630]  That's all I have to say about it. Uh, I see, I was saying, I see more expression.
[01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:07.790]  The plants showed more color. Um, a Sativa stream that has never really foxtailed on me
[01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:13.630]  kind of made fingery buds. Um, I got a lot of color. I keep saying that the color was tremendous
[01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:19.550]  on this run, but I feel like it lowered my harvest weight by somewhere between 10 and 20%.
[01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:23.310]  I'm not, I haven't cut everything down yet. I've got more to go, but I could tell it diminished
[01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:27.310]  my harvest that may have been from the cold, but I really think it was from that light cycle.
[01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:32.270]  I felt the same thing about it. Yeah. Yeah. We always preach it. The most important nutrient
[01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:39.070]  to our plants is the light. And so we took a full hour and that's, we took 63 hours, 65 hours away
[01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:44.830]  from our plants, honestly. Yeah. And one thing I did notice they finished quickly. Uh, I probably
[01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:48.990]  saved two weeks on some of my 10 or 11 week strains. They're going to finish week nine and
[01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:53.310]  there'll be done. I I'm worried to let them go too long. One may herm out. I can see it kind
[01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:58.110]  of getting pissy. It's like, you got to cut me down. Yeah. Which is cool. I'll cut her, but I
[01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:04.910]  just wasn't ready. It's a, it's a neat tool and a breeding aspect. Um, you know, if we were testing
[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:09.470]  across, we had made, if you're looking for Fino, if you're hunting, that is a good point,
[01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:14.510]  but that's probably the only time I'll use it again. You hear that you've got growers and
[01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:19.550]  advanced breeders and people talking about this. So just please don't try this at home. Yeah.
[01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:25.630]  There's no need for you to do it on your day to day crop. Stick with 1212. You guys stick with
[01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:29.710]  1212. If you want to get adventurous, if you're a, if you're kind of advanced, do what you want
[01:38:29.710 --> 01:38:34.110]  to do. I don't, I don't, I don't want to hold anybody back, but be responsible because if you
[01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:37.550]  do go and herm out that crop, you got to do something with that hermed out crop and don't
[01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:41.310]  go try to, you did not just make a seed company. You're not called Calypso seeds.
[01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:50.910]  The bigger lover smokes mids. If you've heard your crop, you did just not make a seed company.
[01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:54.190]  You made a mistake. You got to get those seeds out of there and grow them, grow them yourself.
[01:38:54.190 --> 01:38:58.110]  Give them to your friend, give free. Those are free seeds. That shit is free. Those are the
[01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:01.950]  seeds you give to your friends. You warn them. These are from her. And then you'll understand
[01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:06.830]  hopefully what were, you know, all the breeders are bitching about. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:12.590]  Sean, I'm just picking on you. No, sorry. There's another guy named Sean figure lover. His name's
[01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:16.990]  Sean also. Oh yeah. Yeah. I didn't know. That's what is now. I see. I don't know if I should even
[01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:22.910]  say guys. Yeah. Whatever. He posted a picture of himself today. Did you, I don't even know what he
[01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:28.110]  looks like. He's been apparently he was at like seven years or 15 years at GMOs or something.
[01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:36.430]  The guy's a nut. His cats go. That is, that is wild. Yeah. It's not, that is crazy. You know,
[01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:41.070]  when you, if somebody standing next to you and you're scrolling through your Instagram feed
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:44.190]  and then you hit vigorous page of a cat taking a shit in the toilet.
[01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:50.590]  So our buddy vigor lover trained to kitties, adorable kitties. If you're a cat guy,
[01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:55.310]  he trained these kitties to full on, take a shit in the toilet like a human. And they drew it up.
[01:39:55.310 --> 01:40:01.310]  But the only thing is he posts a video of it every day. Like I've seen more cat butthole on
[01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:05.310]  his feed than I have plants lately. It's kind of weird. Shout out to vigor lover, dude.
[01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:12.830]  I start tagging that Irish genetics. Yeah. Cats pooping hashtag Irish genetics. I like it.
[01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:17.470]  Thanks a lot. I like that. I guess we've got about 10 minutes to go. I don't want to start.
[01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:20.190]  We're going to have Sean back because we've got more stuff to talk about. I don't want to start
[01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:23.710]  another long rant because we get them going. Do you guys have any plugs or shout outs or anything
[01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:28.750]  you want to do? People you want to say thanks to? Just a Rocky Mount worm company. I can't give
[01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:32.750]  enough thanks to Jay and his father. Do they have an Instagram or anything? They do. Rocky
[01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:39.070]  Mount worm company. Check them out. They've got a Facebook page. That's where all the cool kids are
[01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:46.750]  on these days. They've also got a website, a rocky mount worm company.com and then they ship all over
[01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:51.790]  the country to high quality. Yeah, I know. I happen to know a high quality nutrient company
[01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:59.950]  that smuggles the stuff into Canada. You know, just be thankful that you, if you live in Colorado,
[01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:04.910]  go and get the damn castings because there's people out there who just want them so bad and
[01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:10.750]  just can't afford the shipping or they don't have access to them. It's just such an underutilized
[01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:14.270]  thing here in town. And it doesn't sound like you need a whole bunch. You said like a quarter cup.
[01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:17.950]  Yeah. I mean, most people are putting in a cup per gallon, these outrageous rates,
[01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:22.670]  and you can use a fourth of cup. I mean, you're five to 10% cutting into your soil
[01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:28.270]  mixes just more than enough. I use like 80 pounds of it on my six outdoor plants.
[01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:32.270]  Yeah. And you guys will notice a huge difference. Grow a clone, grow two clones,
[01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:35.470]  keep them in cups for like three weeks, you know, until they're starting to get root bound to where
[01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:40.270]  they're pissed off root bound. Feed one consistently with your microbial tea with
[01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:44.350]  the worm castings in it. Don't add that to your other one when you feed it and pull them out of
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:49.390]  the cup and watch you'll have thicker, fingery, dank, happy roots on one. And the other one,
[01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:52.510]  you'll have these thin angel hair pasta, wispy, shitty, sad roots.
[01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:58.350]  If you mulch the one that you're giving the micro mobile Jesus tripped on that word.
[01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:04.190]  If you put some mulch on there, you'll see some really cool shit happen. So try it.
[01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:08.030]  Nice. Yeah. You see some fun or just a plastic cover.
[01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:11.310]  Some fungus among us. Hey, where do we find you on Instagram?
[01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:16.030]  King Cola. Nice. King underscore Cola. Follow him on there guys.
[01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:22.590]  Rocky mountain natural farming. You can link through that on my Instagram or Jay's Instagram,
[01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:25.470]  Rocky mountain worm company. Do you have a store opening soon?
[01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:33.550]  Well, we have a shop up in Colorado Springs for 11, a four 11, a Tijuana street in Colorado Springs.
[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:37.550]  You can come and check us out, see the worm operation, check it out for yourself. If you
[01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:44.030]  got any questions, you know, just come and ask. Nice. Nice. Jesse, any plugs, any shout outs?
[01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:50.270]  Jesse grows Instagram. Say hi to your wife, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Hey baby.
[01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:55.150]  Bird. I hope you're listening to the agriculture podcast. I hope you're playing it in the store.
[01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:58.510]  Play the show in the store. That'd be really cool. I keep telling her too. She's like,
[01:42:58.510 --> 01:43:03.470]  I've already heard it. Yeah, I did that. Oh God. I could edit that out.
[01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:10.510]  That's okay. When is the next growers meeting? I think we might be skipping December.
[01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:16.990]  Christmas and New Year's and everything. Lack of a heater. Oh, it is cold back there. Yeah.
[01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:21.230]  Okay. But we're getting one. Sounds good. We'll take December off. I want to make sure I make it
[01:43:21.230 --> 01:43:26.990]  to this one. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, me and Sean have talked about some cool demos that he might
[01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:31.870]  come and help us with. Tell Jesse you want to learn some natural farming too. Yeah. Hit me up.
[01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:36.030]  Yeah. Let's let's get this going. I'd love to stock more of this stuff in.
[01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:41.950]  To get rid of one of those things we talked about earlier. I got a whole bunch of shelf space.
[01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:44.110]  Help him help you make your own.
[01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:50.830]  Some synthetic grower in California or wherever you are. Hit me up, dude. I'll
[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:55.550]  show you all that advanced. Help us get some organic stuff on the shelf that you don't care
[01:43:55.550 --> 01:44:01.230]  about. Yeah. He'll give you a discount on it. Finish out your grow and then I'll help you
[01:44:01.230 --> 01:44:08.430]  go organics next round. Can they get commercial pricing? They'll get way better.
[01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:15.630]  All right. I guess I got to give one more shout out. I skipped one earlier. I need to give a big
[01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:22.590]  shout out to Robert and Vegas and Craig from the spot. Also Angela. What's up from the spot. Also
[01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:26.750]  just Angela in general, but those kids from the spot, all those guys from the spot and the spot
[01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:32.350]  dispensary in Pueblo West. Huge shout out. Much respect. Some things are coming up in the future.
[01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:39.150]  That's cool. I got a shop opening soon too. So I can't say any names yet though.
[01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:43.950]  Lots of stuff going on. Yeah. I see all the work that this community has put in
[01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:47.630]  is starting to pay off for all of us. Yeah. Finally, some quality meds,
[01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:52.190]  hopefully down here in Pueblo. It's about time. All right, guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:56.030]  Make sure you follow me on Instagram. It's iRegenetics on Instagram. Make sure you follow

[01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:12.270]  as you feel, I believe. I just want that five if you can. Helps me move up in the ranks. More people
[01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:15.710]  listen to the show. The more people that listen to the show, the more people that grow organics.
[01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:19.470]  The more people that grow organics, the more organics you have to smoke. The more people that
[01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:22.910]  are smoking organics, the more people want more people to grow organics. The more people start
[01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:26.670]  growing weed, the more people grow organic weed. The more we outgrow, overgrow the government,
[01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:30.190]  the more we legalize cannabis, the more people listen to my podcast. Repeat.
[01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:32.990]  And grow your own food in there, too. I want that on a shirt.
[01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:36.590]  All of that that I just said printed on the front of a shirt? Yeah.
[01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:39.550]  And then repeat, and then write it on the back again, and then just spin around and just have
[01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:43.550]  somebody keep spinning around. More trees, less assholes. Someone really famous said that,
[01:45:44.110 --> 01:45:48.350]  but I can't remember their name or what they did. I wonder why.
[01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:51.630]  They have a cool... Hey, I want to congratulate Jesse for making it all the way through this
[01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:55.950]  episode. Yeah. I took a whole bunch of dabs, too.
[01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:57.870]  Yeah, you did. A couple of you guys didn't even hear.
[01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:00.910]  He took a little nap on the couch last time. It was cute. All right.
[01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:02.990]  It was a great nap. Guys, don't forget that the podcast is

[01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:46.750]  you were on time. That coffee stop counts as you were still on time even after that. In our world,
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:50.670]  it was awesome. All right. Until next time, guys, shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.630]  Thanks for listening. Take a fat dab. Give your mama a hug for me.
[01:47:16.750 --> 01:48:00.930]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for episode number 44 of the iGrowCulture podcast.
[01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:08.530]  Number 44. Oh, man, it's a super special episode. On the mic over there to my left is a super high
[01:48:08.530 --> 01:48:09.170]  ... Rick Flair.
[01:48:09.170 --> 01:48:12.930]  Yeah, Rick Flair's over there. That's my super high buddy, Adam. How you doing, bro?
[01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:16.290]  I'm good, man. We brought Adam on the show because for some reason ... We're not going
[01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:20.370]  to get too far into why, but for some reason, we call Adam 44 in our group.
[01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.490]  It's a special number.
[01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:24.530]  It's a special number. Sitting across the table from me is our good buddy,
[01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:25.650]  Jesse. How you doing, bro?
[01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:26.850]  Pretty good. How's it going?
[01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:30.210]  Thanks for coming. Oh, dude, I'm doing great. I don't know if you're talking to me or the podcast
[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:31.810]  world. I'll answer for you.
[01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:34.690]  I don't think anyone's ever asked you how's it going on your show.
[01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:38.930]  I'm fucking high. I'm drinking Yerba Mate and I got two of my best friends at the table.
[01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:39.490]  Nice.
[01:48:39.490 --> 01:48:42.530]  I'm doing great. There's nothing to complain about. I'm super happy right now.
[01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:46.050]  Speaking of Mate, I'm going to reach over and take a sip. Why don't you guys say something
[01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:46.610]  entertaining?
[01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:49.970]  I'm right there with you, man. It's been a good deal.
[01:48:51.250 --> 01:48:52.610]  That wasn't very entertaining.
[01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:55.490]  Yeah, I know. It's been a good week to say the least.
[01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:56.610]  You give the mic to Adam and he just-
[01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:59.330]  Yeah, I just stumble over shit and sit here and talk to myself.
[01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:01.090]  Words were coming out. That's better than silence.
[01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:01.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:03.970]  Dead air is what you don't want, but it eats.
[01:49:05.650 --> 01:49:09.410]  All right. We're just going to take it, Jeff. Adam's going to stop talking now and I'm going
[01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:10.450]  to do a podcast.
[01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:11.330]  Fade the mic out.
[01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:14.530]  I'm going to turn Adam's mic up and turn down the music a little bit.
[01:49:17.170 --> 01:49:19.890]  I'm going to tease a little bit. Coming up in this episode, we're going to read a little bit
[01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:24.930]  about some Seth Rogen stuff. Seth Rogen came to Denver recently. His idea backfired. We'll talk
[01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:28.770]  a little bit about that. I've got an article from President Obama. It's not from him. It's
[01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:32.770]  about him. There might've been another news article. I don't remember what I wrote down.
[01:49:32.770 --> 01:49:37.010]  Where is it? It's right here. Oh, the natives. We'll talk about some stuff that may happen on
[01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:38.530]  Indian reservations pretty soon here.
[01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:40.690]  Ooh, I've been waiting for that announcement.
[01:49:40.690 --> 01:49:40.930]  Yeah.
[01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:43.730]  I grew up next to a reservation.
[01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:45.970]  And I have a special announcement coming up also.
[01:49:45.970 --> 01:49:46.770]  Yes, you do.
[01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:51.490]  Yes, I do. Some official shit here. Let's quickly do some advertising. Guys, I know
[01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:55.490]  that the advertising gets old. I don't like you to do this, but there's that 30 second forward on the
[01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:58.130]  iTunes. Just hit that if you get tired of it.

[01:52:47.970 --> 01:52:56.050]  Fuck. We got nanos in stock. We got the RTU systems for them. It's cloud-based controlling.
[01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:06.770]  No more power boxes needed. Timers are all built in. All kinds of niche. They turn themselves up
[01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:13.890]  and down. If you want it, he'll order it if he doesn't have it. You can grow while you're
[01:53:13.890 --> 01:53:20.610]  on vacation, essentially. Yeah, to a point. To a point. If you've got a Hydro Grow. It does some
[01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:26.050]  data logging too for your temperatures. Wow. You don't have to pay attention all day. You can come
[01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:31.810]  back. Check the data. You should pay attention. I'm not really a big computer guy, but I think
[01:53:31.810 --> 01:53:35.810]  cloud-based means you can check it from your phone. I'm looking at Adam.
[01:53:37.570 --> 01:53:43.250]  With security cameras and temperatures, you can basically just have another camera on. You don't
[01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:47.650]  even need all that data to you as long as you can see another camera that had all that data
[01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:55.250]  on the wall. There's multiple ways to do that. Nice. We'll go down there and check it out. I
[01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:59.490]  want to go see what you got to offer. Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, you guys. It's just over the
[01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:03.010]  bridge in Pueblo. There's a little bit of parking in the back. I've heard that there's nowhere to
[01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:10.530]  park. There are spots in the back, you guys. We got the door all fixed up too. Probably by the
[01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:15.250]  time this airs, it'll be all fixed up and you can just walk in the back. Nice. Nice. Yeah. Park in
[01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:19.330]  the back. If you drive through the little taco thing or through the alley and just turn right,
[01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:23.090]  you're right there in the back of Hygro. It's that door. The door that you wonder, is that the one?
[01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:29.570]  Yes. That's Hygro. Oh, I know. Shout out to a handful of people that hit us up for Rocky
[01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:34.850]  Mountain Earthworm Castings. They'll be in stock soon. Sweet. Can we say who the order from Arizona
[01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:40.690]  came from? Do you remember who that is? No. Nevada, actually. Nevada. Yeah. And no, I do not recall.
[01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:43.650]  That may have been a totally different email then. I'm going to have to check that. Shout out to the
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:47.250]  people that emailed me and thank you. You know who you are. They're coming to the store. They
[01:54:47.250 --> 01:54:50.210]  definitely said they're coming to the store. So shout out to those guys that messaged me. Sorry,
[01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:54.610]  I got your state wrong. If I did, I'm in Colorado and those two states, Arizona and Nevada are the
[01:54:54.610 --> 01:55:00.930]  big desert down there. Yeah. Hey, we're all square states. Yeah. I do hope you guys have time to
[01:55:00.930 --> 01:55:04.530]  message me when you're coming to Colorado to Pueblo and we'll visit. We'll link up, maybe take
[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:08.290]  some dabs if you're into that. That'd be cool. All right. So big love and much respect to all
[01:55:08.290 --> 01:55:12.210]  the sponsors for making the show possible. A big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band,
[01:55:12.210 --> 01:55:15.810]  Coot Dog and Cat and the rest of the Mystic Roots Band. They let me play their, all of their music.
[01:55:15.810 --> 01:55:20.370]  They've given me full permission for their whole catalog on the show. That helps a guy out trying
[01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:24.050]  to run a show and keep things fresh. That's pretty damn cool. I've been playing a song called the
[01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:28.530]  Doggy Dub for the intro for the past couple episodes. It's instrumental. It's got a nice
[01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:33.810]  flow to it. It's kind of got my vibe. So thanks for letting me use that. Let's see. I have a
[01:55:33.810 --> 01:55:38.290]  Stitcher comment. I like to read the Stitcher or the Stitcher and iTunes comment. I have an iTunes
[01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:42.770]  comment from our good friend, Fred Garvin. What's up, Fred? Thanks for listening, bro. He said,
[01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:48.770]  great show, man. Thanks. That means a lot to me. Yeah. Thanks, Fred. Thanks to everyone.
[01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:51.970]  Me and Jesse were talking about that the other day that Stitcher really needs to get on that,
[01:55:51.970 --> 01:55:56.450]  that comment section thing where it just, it needs to be linked right to you or maybe somewhere where
[01:55:56.450 --> 01:56:03.570]  somebody else can see it. Like just the looker, not maybe a user that has to log in and Stitcher
[01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:09.410]  is hard. You can't comment from a mobile device on Stitcher. I can't find any way to do that. So
[01:56:09.490 --> 01:56:15.010]  Stitcher, get on that, you guys. I mean, that's how I listen. Every single podcast is through
[01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:20.770]  Stitcher. So I mean, it's what I use. So if you guys on Stitcher want to leave a comment,
[01:56:20.770 --> 01:56:25.570]  I apologize that you can't, but you can go to the iGrow Culture Facebook page and log in and
[01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:29.890]  leave a comment, or you can just simply email me. I would love to read your email. I appreciate that
[01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:33.970]  just as much. If you want me to read it on the show, I certainly will. The YouTube is another
[01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:38.530]  place where you can go and comment. Maybe not all the episodes are up, but you know, they will be
[01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:43.090]  catching up. I've been keeping myself extra busy. You can still put something down like episode 35
[01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:46.850]  was da da da da da da da da. And it's there for everybody to read. They don't have to have a
[01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:50.930]  YouTube account or anything like that. That's one of the reasons that you put it up on that market.
[01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:55.010]  The iRead Genetics site too, you can comment too. Yeah, you can. Yep. I'd like it if you guys,
[01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:58.930]  if you're a listener that listens a lot and you want to interact, if you go to the iRead Genetics
[01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:04.610]  Colorado website, join the forum, make yourself a profile on there, go to one of my posts or go
[01:57:04.610 --> 01:57:09.170]  start a new post. Ask me a question. I will interact with you for sure. I do that. Usually
[01:57:09.170 --> 01:57:13.170]  on Monday or Tuesday nights when I get all my work done, I want to sit back, take some dabs,
[01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:17.650]  I dab out and go on the forum and just post pictures. I post a lot of pictures of my crops.
[01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:22.930]  Yeah. There's a lot of stuff on there that doesn't make it to Instagram. And one thing that's cool is
[01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:27.570]  they can't filter me. That's my website. I own that. My buddy Tony and I built that. Tony built
[01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:31.570]  it. I drew it in crayon pretty much on a paper. I was like, this is what I want the homepage to
[01:57:31.570 --> 01:57:35.170]  look like. And then I drew tabs at the top and then I was like, this is what I want the second
[01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:40.050]  page to look like. And he kind of did my vision. It's a work in progress, you know, but for what I
[01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:44.610]  drew, he nailed it. I joined it when you first launched it. I think so. I think that's about
[01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:48.850]  all I've done as well. Just joined it. Well, just go click like on some shit and put some traffic on
[01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:53.250]  there. I thought you got it. Remember, no, I was the one that found out that I had a karma deal
[01:57:54.050 --> 01:58:00.130]  or something. So we got that worked out as well. So it is what it is. I also want to give a huge
[01:58:00.130 --> 01:58:05.010]  thanks to everyone who sent me messages and comments from episode 43. That was awesome. I got
[01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:10.370]  more response off episode 40, 35 and 43 have been our most popular episodes. 35 was drying and
[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:17.970]  curing with Jesse and I, and 43 was organics with King Cola. So King Cola will definitely, definitely
[01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:22.530]  be back. Big, huge thanks to King Cola. Sean, if you're listening, thanks a lot, dude. I've got a
[01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:26.370]  couple of questions for you from a listener, actually. He wants me to relay a couple of
[01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:31.090]  questions. So we got to get you back on. Yeah, I got a few too. And I had a ton of response from
[01:58:31.090 --> 01:58:36.850]  it as well. Thank you everyone. There's a huge episode. I hope that worked out. Rocky mountain
[01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:41.570]  worm company is going to definitely see some results for that. Shout out to those guys. I'm
[01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:45.010]  going to go down there and get myself a, I've got some plants that are going to transplant into
[01:58:45.010 --> 01:58:50.450]  larger pots here within the next five days and they will definitely be getting fed Rocky mountain
[01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:56.290]  Yeah. There's, there's an opportunity there as well. You know, like, um, you guys tell them that
[01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:59.570]  you're listening to the podcast, tell them that people are here in Colorado or supporting them
[01:58:59.570 --> 01:59:03.170]  and not as they've actually commented on the podcast that they listened. That's awesome.
[01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.730]  That's what I'm saying. We may have a wormy sponsor here in the future. I never heard of it,
[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:13.570]  you know, and I'm, I'm with these guys most of the time. It was kind of one of their like little
[01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:17.730]  held secrets, but then they blasted it on the podcast. So, you know, it's not held secret,
[01:59:17.730 --> 01:59:22.770]  but it's just, you gotta know secrets. That's all Sean brought that to the table. Also, I want to
[01:59:22.770 --> 01:59:26.850]  give a huge shout out to everybody from the garden of Whedon. Uh, I mentioned that the garden of
[01:59:26.850 --> 01:59:33.410]  Whedon may be on here, uh, to talk about their secret cup experience. Uh, they just got back
[01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:37.810]  from Vegas. They had a great time. Unfortunately, they did not take home the trophy. Uh, some
[01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:41.330]  coastal guys, one, some guys from the coast, which, you know, you can handle that. They're
[01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:44.690]  not bitter about it. Although they were busy, the garden of Whedon was a little bit busy.
[01:59:44.690 --> 01:59:47.170]  I was over there hanging out today and I was like, you want to come on the show? And they
[01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:51.330]  kind of showed me what they had to take care of and kind of hinted at me that today was not the
[01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:55.250]  day to come on a podcast. So in the future we'll have Spence. Hopefully we can get Maddie over.
[01:59:55.250 --> 01:59:58.690]  Maddie's never been on the show. I don't think no, she hasn't. We got to get Maddie over. Maybe
[01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:03.810]  big Mike will come. That would be the first female on the show. Yeah. And so it'd be an honor to have
[02:00:03.810 --> 02:00:07.330]  it either Maddie or Angela. And I've invited Angela and she doesn't seem excited to talk on
[02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:11.970]  the show, which is understandable if you're not a podcast person, that's cool. But busy is the
[02:00:11.970 --> 02:00:16.130]  word of the week. Everybody's been slamming busy for a couple of weeks just to get everybody to
[02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:19.650]  pull out of their lives for an hour to come do the podcast with. Not only that, but let's look at,
[02:00:19.650 --> 02:00:25.410]  you know, like he'd been sick just there before. So he's been, he's good, man. He's good.
[02:00:27.250 --> 02:00:31.330]  He looks good now. He's put a Spence was down to like 140 pounds. He's six foot four.
[02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:35.570]  It was 140 pounds. He's almost back to a normal weight. Nice. I'm just glad to hear that he made
[02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:41.810]  it home. All you can eat buffers. He was talking about some of the banging food. They said they
[02:00:41.890 --> 02:00:45.570]  had a French toast at some place. And I was like, let's get in the car, bro. Let's just go
[02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:50.770]  make some bomb French toast. We'll go over to Jesse's later. I want to send a huge shout out
[02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:54.610]  to Joey. Joey got a hoodie from me today and I hadn't seen Joey in a long time. So it was kind
[02:00:54.610 --> 02:00:57.810]  of nice to hook up with Joey, get him a hoodie. You're going to look sharp in that hoodie.
[02:00:58.450 --> 02:01:01.170]  I'm wrapping up shout outs. I know I got a lot of them here at the start of the show. It's easier
[02:01:01.170 --> 02:01:06.210]  to get them out of the way. Much respect and much thanks and much love to Mike, Adam, and Angela.
[02:01:06.930 --> 02:01:11.650]  They trimmed their little fingers off. Oh my God. Well, Angela's little fingers might have
[02:01:11.730 --> 02:01:15.970]  normal size. She's beastly at it though. I don't know how the little chick trims faster than
[02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:20.770]  anybody else I know. Angela is, I will say it on the air, Angela is the fastest trimmer I've ever
[02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:24.290]  known. There's one guy I know that might keep up, but he takes Adderall.
[02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:30.290]  I think the guy that might keep up. You can't compete if you're enhancing.
[02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:38.210]  Well, she's taking, she's dabbing. So yeah. Well, yeah. Giving people shit. Also a huge shout.
[02:01:38.210 --> 02:01:43.330]  Angela is involved in this shout out again, but huge shout out to Angela, Vegas, Craig,
[02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:48.290]  everybody over at The Spot. I got to give a huge shout out to The Spot dispensary in Pueblo West,
[02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:52.290]  Colorado. They've treated me super kind. We've been in a couple of talks, a couple of meetings,
[02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:56.770]  some things have happened. I think I'm ready to make the official announcement. Today in the mail,
[02:01:56.770 --> 02:02:01.570]  I received my Colorado Med badge. I am now officially legally licensed to work in a Colorado
[02:02:01.570 --> 02:02:05.810]  medical marijuana facility, which means that at this time I can take the job that I've been
[02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:11.170]  offered. I am now the official master grower at The Spot in Pueblo, Colorado. So within the next
[02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:15.570]  few months, there's a little bit of work to be done on the grow site to get it up to what I want,
[02:02:15.570 --> 02:02:20.690]  what we are expecting. There are over 200 lights in there. I'll be the master grower for those 200
[02:02:20.690 --> 02:02:25.570]  lights, which means that in probably, I'm going to say six months, I'm going to give myself six
[02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:30.610]  months. You guys will see fire coming out of there produced by Rasta Jeff out of The Spot in Pueblo,
[02:02:30.610 --> 02:02:34.930]  Colorado. Way cool. Way cool. I'm excited to announce that one. I'm proud to be a part of
[02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:39.170]  that team. I was a little picky about where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do. A couple of
[02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:45.250]  people have offered me things. I like their grow and I get along with the people there. So it'll be
[02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:51.650]  a great, great thing to do. My girlfriend is the bud tender. I am the master grower. My girlfriend
[02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:56.850]  is the trimmer also. So it'll go from, it'll have my love in it all the way from the seed or the
[02:02:56.850 --> 02:03:02.050]  clone all the way up to the time it reaches the customer and or patient's container. So it's going
[02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:05.730]  to have Rasta Jeff love from beginning to end now. So yeah, I'm proud to work with The Spot.
[02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:09.170]  That's my big announcement that I've been kind of teasing about on social media and stuff.
[02:03:10.610 --> 02:03:16.290]  I want to compliment the Colorado MED in Springs. Everybody made it sound like it was a big deal to
[02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:20.210]  go get your med badge and it was a pain in the ass. I did have a couple of things. I had a tax
[02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:24.850]  issue from my past that I had to clear up and I had to get a noted paper that my child support
[02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:28.290]  was current and cleaned up, but I already did that because I knew that was coming and they
[02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:31.970]  never asked for it, but they said that they would. They never asked for those papers.
[02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:35.410]  I went in there. So in Colorado Springs, you're able to call and make an appointment.
[02:03:35.410 --> 02:03:39.090]  The hardest part is getting the appointment. Call every day until you get an appointment
[02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:42.370]  because I had to call three times in a row. They called me back after the third one.
[02:03:42.930 --> 02:03:47.170]  I set an appointment. I got there early. She saw I was early. She took me right when I got there.
[02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:51.730]  Boom. She got me out of there within 30 minutes. My full appointment was 30 minutes.
[02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:56.850]  Giving her the paper, she reviewed the paper and it's one lady that's there all the time. I wish I
[02:03:56.850 --> 02:04:00.370]  could remember her name. I was excited and anxious. So I don't even know what she looks like
[02:04:00.370 --> 02:04:04.290]  to tell you the truth. You go into that fucking concert mode. You know what I mean? I just want
[02:04:04.290 --> 02:04:09.410]  to see this and get it done. Med lady. Yes. Med lady. She was awesome. But they take your fingerprints
[02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:13.010]  on the digital fingerprinter, which is kind of fun. And then they run all your background checks
[02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:16.770]  and then they take a picture of you and she high fives you and tells you have a good day. And
[02:04:16.770 --> 02:04:21.730]  that happened Tuesday at 11 o'clock. Today when I got my mail, it is Thursday as we record,
[02:04:21.730 --> 02:04:26.450]  my med badge came in the mail today. So my background check, my tax thing, all my child
[02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:30.850]  support, my fingerprints, everything got done probably within five or six hours.
[02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:35.570]  You got her hands down the fastest turnover rate I've heard of.
[02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:39.410]  I went prepared. I went with everything I needed because I called and asked. I was like,
[02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:43.810]  what am I going to need? I have like, I have a small business. I have child support. Do I need
[02:04:43.810 --> 02:04:46.930]  to? She's like, as long as your child support is current and you can prove it. And as long as your
[02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:49.490]  taxes are good on your small business. And I was like, I got that watch.
[02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:50.130]  Nice.
[02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:54.370]  They never asked for proof. I guess they probably could tell just by.
[02:04:54.370 --> 02:04:55.650]  Yeah, they do some.
[02:04:55.650 --> 02:05:00.610]  Most of their application was 13 pages. I think seven of those pages are you signing,
[02:05:00.610 --> 02:05:05.090]  writing your name, signing and dating, saying that this agency can go through all of my shit
[02:05:05.650 --> 02:05:09.890]  and this agency can go through all of my shit. And if I missed anything, this other agency can
[02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:14.130]  go through all the other shit. And it's like everything but your medical records get reviewed.
[02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:19.010]  I think your money, your criminal, like, yeah. And then she puts on a rubber glove. She puts
[02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:21.570]  on a rubber glove and says, you want to come back here with me? And they're just
[02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:24.530]  fingerprinting you at that point. But I was like, they're going that far.
[02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:30.610]  That's why everybody talks about how bad it is. Maybe they're getting the wrong treatment up
[02:05:30.610 --> 02:05:35.090]  there. Maybe you were just nice. Maybe. I cannot say I had that experience, but
[02:05:35.090 --> 02:05:41.570]  no, but I got mine right before the first of the year last year. So I bet that there was a lot of
[02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:46.850]  people. Yeah. Well, now in screens, you can make appointments and they're kind of sticklers. They
[02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:50.290]  will tell you if you miss your appointment, it'll be a while before you can get back. Cause you go
[02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:55.090]  to the bottom of the list and you're like, oh shit. So you got it. Yeah. And I was, I'm prepared.
[02:05:55.090 --> 02:06:02.050]  I left an hour and a half early to get to 45 minute drive. My puppy ate my badge. So oops,
[02:06:02.050 --> 02:06:05.170]  10 bucks for a replacement. I don't think you need an appointment for that.
[02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:10.770]  Oh shit. Okay. They do not take cash. You guys, if you ever go into the med,
[02:06:10.770 --> 02:06:14.530]  go get a money order for the total. Oh, that's changed. Yeah. That's anything pretty much here.
[02:06:15.490 --> 02:06:20.850]  Except for like that office in Springs isn't in a shitty area, but parts of Springs right near like
[02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:24.130]  Colorado Springs on one side of the street is gorgeous. The other side of the street, you're
[02:06:24.130 --> 02:06:28.290]  like, I don't want to fucking park my car here. And they're kind of in one of those like off to
[02:06:28.290 --> 02:06:32.610]  the side areas. They could be, I wouldn't wreck, I'm not saying this. They could easily be a victim
[02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:36.210]  of robbery or something. I'm not saying go do it. I'm saying they could. So it's wise that they don't
[02:06:36.210 --> 02:06:42.450]  keep a lot of cash. And my badge alone was 300 bucks and they probably do 20 appointments a day
[02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:48.130]  at 150 or $300 per appointment. Price went up for that too. Yeah. Yeah. It's 150 for the key
[02:06:48.130 --> 02:06:51.810]  or 150 for the support and 300 for the key. I had to get the key. Cause I'm the guy in the back.
[02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:57.410]  All the prices doubled. Yeah. Yeah. And if you're upgrading badges, it's still like 253 bucks to go
[02:06:57.410 --> 02:07:00.690]  from one to the other. Like you should have just paid that in the beginning. So guys, if you're
[02:07:00.690 --> 02:07:04.210]  curious, if you need to get the big badge or the little one, if you can afford it, just get the
[02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:10.610]  big one. Yeah. Yeah. It makes you a more valuable asset too. You can actually ask for more pay if
[02:07:10.610 --> 02:07:17.570]  you want that long term badge. Yeah. That'd be a good episode. Well, I guess we just did it.
[02:07:19.090 --> 02:07:24.530]  The short end of the list. Yeah. There's a lot of Colorado listeners. I'll back up a couple steps.
[02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:29.650]  If you guys want to apply to be able to work in the medical marijuana industry, in the marijuana
[02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:32.770]  industry, you can take the medical word out. If you want to be employed in any way in the
[02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:39.410]  marijuana industry in Colorado, what you need to do is go to, there's a website, it's the-
[02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:42.210]  The department of revenue, Colorado department of revenue.
[02:07:42.210 --> 02:07:47.810]  And there will be marijuana documents on there. Print out the application for, it's a med
[02:07:48.450 --> 02:07:53.250]  employment application. And it's not the business application. It's only the one for
[02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:58.290]  an employment. And it'll say key or support, which is how you know if you're doing the right ones.
[02:07:58.290 --> 02:08:03.330]  You want the, just go for that key or support. If you don't want to be like a manager or something,
[02:08:03.330 --> 02:08:06.530]  if you just want to trim or bud tend, all you need is a support. But if you want to get paid
[02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:10.610]  a little more, and if you want to have some chance of climbing up that corporate ladder,
[02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:17.490]  get that big one, get that support. Then they always have to have a support badge on premises.
[02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:22.610]  So if boss needs to go somewhere, maybe you can step up and show that you can do that shit. That's
[02:08:22.610 --> 02:08:27.010]  how people advance. So go on the website, print out that application, read it thoroughly before
[02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:31.490]  you even start printing. Because there's one page that says, if any of this stuff applies to you,
[02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:36.210]  go fuck yourself. It pretty much says, if you did this, you cannot get a badge. It's straight up,
[02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:42.930]  no. Just read your application now. Primarily, it's kind of the same stuff as getting into the
[02:08:42.930 --> 02:08:49.810]  military. So no drug felonies. Yeah. No drug felonies is their main one. I should have had
[02:08:49.810 --> 02:08:54.930]  the list here, but I didn't realize we're going to have this conversation. I mean, all that's there.
[02:08:55.650 --> 02:09:02.210]  And it's basically common sense at that point. So if you're in another state or whatever-
[02:09:02.210 --> 02:09:09.410]  Just to clarify, this means to work behind a counter selling herb to people, selling cannabis
[02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:14.770]  to people. Legally. Now, this doesn't mean you can't live in Colorado and can't have three plants
[02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:19.650]  or six plants, whatever the state. That's not what this is about. You can still be a caregiver. You
[02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:24.050]  can still grow your own. This is just to work in a regulated shop. To become part of the industry.
[02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:29.570]  And right now, I hate saying this, but it's what I feel and part of why I'm making the business
[02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:34.290]  decisions I'm making. So I think that in the future, iRegenetics will be able to breed inside
[02:09:34.290 --> 02:09:39.490]  of this large facility that I've just become master grower of. And right now, if I don't make
[02:09:39.490 --> 02:09:43.490]  a move like that, the way that I'm growing and the way that my business model works, I think
[02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:47.650]  the industry will squeeze me right out. I either need to join it or get squeezed out of it. And
[02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:51.890]  this is my way to join it and not disappear. I want to be here for the long haul. I've thought
[02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:57.010]  about this. I feel like I'm selling out a little bit, but I'd rather give than not exist at all.
[02:09:57.010 --> 02:10:01.570]  That's what I got to do. I totally agree. Yeah. So, all right, guys, if you get that application,
[02:10:01.570 --> 02:10:06.370]  fill it out. If you're not in Colorado, you got to come to Colorado and you have to show initiative.
[02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:10.530]  You have to go to a bunch of dispensaries and apply in person. You have to be kind of persistent,
[02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:14.450]  almost be an asshole about it because so many people apply every day. If you're a hot chick,
[02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:18.290]  you're going to get in. Don't worry about it. You have to know a little bit about cannabis.
[02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:24.850]  Come with some knowledge. Show and be willing to start at a shitty job. Be willing to clean
[02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:29.090]  the toilets and trim pot for eight hours a day, because that's what we need. Mostly we need
[02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:36.050]  trimmers. Trimmers get paid decently here. And be dependable, please. There's such a high turnover
[02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:40.210]  rate in this industry. It's ridiculous. It's one thing that kind of looks bad about it.
[02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:44.210]  Don't brag about your trimming ability. Don't tell me you can trim a pound and show up and not be
[02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:48.610]  able to trim it all. We'll fire you. While you're on your phone. While you're on your phone all day.
[02:10:48.610 --> 02:10:53.570]  There are so many people. There are so many people from around the world that want in this industry.
[02:10:53.650 --> 02:10:58.290]  And if you don't perform to top notch, we'll fire you. I can't say we, I just got into this shit.
[02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:00.530]  I moved here. They'll fire you. They'll keep you in the front right now.
[02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:06.690]  I can tell you firsthand, if you don't, there's plenty of people that hit the wall every day and
[02:11:06.690 --> 02:11:12.130]  then they get paid and they're just like, I'm rich. And I'm around marijuana all day. And it's
[02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:21.410]  like, nope. They just drop out like flies. It may be a cool job, but it is still very much a job.
[02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.890]  It's still work.
[02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:22.850]  And this is business.
[02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:28.770]  I visit dispensaries here in town. And when I go in there every week and nobody's there
[02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:31.090]  or it's a different people in there every week.
[02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:33.410]  Different employees, no customers.
[02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:39.570]  Plenty of customers, especially recreational and stuff like that. There's always lines.
[02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:44.050]  I've been going to the spot for a couple of reasons recently, mostly to talk to the owners
[02:11:44.050 --> 02:11:47.570]  out there and the bosses and to see if we can negotiate. And also my favorite person,
[02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:51.170]  a second favorite person. I have a daughter, sorry, girlfriend, you're second. The daughter
[02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:54.370]  comes first. I'm just kind of picking on you, but she's out there and I go out there to visit
[02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:58.050]  her and go take her lunch or just go see what's up. And dude, it's hard for her to get away from
[02:11:58.050 --> 02:12:02.530]  the counter because they've got business. You're not going to go and sit down behind a counter and
[02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:06.930]  be like socializing with people. You would think that, you still have to have customer service,
[02:12:06.930 --> 02:12:12.610]  but you have 14 people out in the lobby waiting. I told the bosses there that I don't want a
[02:12:12.610 --> 02:12:16.370]  bud tend. I said, no, I'd rather not be a bud tender. I'd just rather stick with being the
[02:12:16.370 --> 02:12:20.530]  grower, because it'll be downtime for me. But I think once in a while, just for fun,
[02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:23.970]  and I'll announce it on the podcast. I'll be like, Hey guys, and I'm not, I don't mean this
[02:12:23.970 --> 02:12:26.930]  right now. You guys, this is just hypothetical and I'm not even going to say it like a real
[02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:31.570]  sentence. I'll say on this day, I will be bud tending at the spot. If you guys want to come
[02:12:31.570 --> 02:12:35.730]  and buy some Capelton from Ross to Jeff, you mentioned the agriculture podcast. We'll give
[02:12:35.730 --> 02:12:40.370]  you 10% off. That's cool. Yeah. That shit's going to be happening pretty soon. That's the kind of
[02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:44.850]  stuff that we have in mind. But tending is kind of fun. I like people. I really love people.
[02:12:44.850 --> 02:12:47.490]  I mean, you've done it before. So that's how I started. Yeah. That's how I got my foot in the
[02:12:47.490 --> 02:12:52.130]  medical industry. I was, well, I started helping transplant somebody, helping somebody transplant
[02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:55.970]  that had their own shop and too many plants that couldn't handle it. And I saw him struggling. I
[02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:59.890]  was like, you need help. And he's like, you know how I was like, fuck you. And he's like, grab a
[02:12:59.890 --> 02:13:05.010]  bucket, do this. And he was older than me. So I was able to work circles around him. And he's like,
[02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:08.530]  come back tomorrow and I'll pay you. And he gave me way more than I expected. And that was for the
[02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:14.930]  rest of the week. So this works kind of how I got my first job. So guys, I guess that's the point.
[02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:20.610]  Go show that you can do some work. Don't be a pussy. Show some initiative. It's the weed
[02:13:20.610 --> 02:13:23.970]  industry. Right? So you're going to think I can show up with my long hair down. I don't need to
[02:13:23.970 --> 02:13:28.690]  take a shower. I could put on my grateful dead shirt, my fucked up jeans. And you can, you can
[02:13:28.690 --> 02:13:33.330]  if you work, but it may, you still got to treat it like a real job interview. We want you to be
[02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:38.210]  able to work. If I I'm saying we, because I've, I've got my own cannabis business. I own a seed
[02:13:38.210 --> 02:13:43.330]  company. I guess I can qualify. I'd rather you kind of just show up and maybe show some initiative.
[02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:47.010]  Yeah. I got, you know, like, and you wouldn't, if somebody would come in and sit at the table
[02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:51.490]  and not do anything the whole time and not show any initiative, then they probably wouldn't be
[02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:55.170]  there on the next one. I mean, that's why the trimmers that were here, there were three trimmers
[02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:59.090]  here for like four nights in a row. And that's kind of stressful to have for all three of those
[02:13:59.090 --> 02:14:03.010]  people to take four nights out of their lives and cut trim pot for me with me helping them.
[02:14:03.010 --> 02:14:07.970]  I could have called two or three other people, but I liked and trusted everybody here. And I could
[02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:11.650]  have driven to the store and came back and nothing would have gone wrong. That's why I keep the
[02:14:11.650 --> 02:14:16.770]  people that I keep. That's what it's about. Trust, be trustworthy, you know, like, and be kind of,
[02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:22.130]  you're not, if you're working in the weed industry, we want some clean people. You're around
[02:14:22.130 --> 02:14:27.730]  stuff that people are consuming. And the MED is a stickler for dirtiness. Jesse just shook his head
[02:14:27.730 --> 02:14:32.370]  and rolled his eyes because he knows the MED is kind of a bitch. I love you guys for giving me my,
[02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:36.210]  my badge, but you guys have some crazy fucked up rules. Wow. Shots fired.
[02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:40.690]  All right. We've been talking a lot about a lot of good news. I do have some semi-sad news. I hope
[02:14:40.690 --> 02:14:45.490]  you guys are ready for this. I'm ready for it. There is rumor that the podcast will receive
[02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:50.690]  a cease and desist letter. We can continue to podcast, but not under the name I Grow Culture.
[02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:57.170]  Nobody has sent me anything yet. A lot of businesses and podcasts and YouTube and Facebook
[02:14:57.170 --> 02:15:02.690]  and Instagram things have been being forewarned that a business called I Grow, which is a college
[02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:08.450]  institution that does college horticultural stuff, is coming after people using the I Grow
[02:15:08.450 --> 02:15:13.490]  moniker. I have no problem changing the name. I just want to do it slowly if it does happen.
[02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:18.370]  And I kind of want to do it preemptively before I actually get a cease and desist letter in the
[02:15:18.370 --> 02:15:23.250]  mail or emailed to me or however it's going to happen. I think it'd just be responsible and kind.
[02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:26.770]  I don't, if that's their name and they've got it, I don't really feel like I want to rip them off.
[02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:29.970]  I just thought it was cute. My buddy Kevin and I came up with it. I was like, it's like,
[02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:36.050]  I wanted to use the I because it's the modern I Grow, I Phone, I Pod. And it's the I World and
[02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:40.850]  it's I Grow. You're listening, you're learning to grow from me on your iPhone. And it's a play on
[02:15:40.850 --> 02:15:45.730]  the word agriculture is what we thought also. So it's the I Grow Culture, but we're going to have
[02:15:45.730 --> 02:15:49.490]  to change it. I already know what the name will become. I haven't decided for sure that I want
[02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:55.250]  to do it. I may just do it on December 1st. We'll go I Grow Culture slash this podcast for a month
[02:15:56.210 --> 02:16:00.690]  or two for the new year. Get used to it. Yeah. Yeah, no, but we may have to change the name.
[02:16:00.690 --> 02:16:04.690]  You guys, it'll still be the same show. Nothing's going to change, but the logo and the title. Hey,
[02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:09.890]  Bender, if you're listening, bro, the new title of the show will be the Grow From Your Heart
[02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:14.450]  Podcast. All right. I could, I could just relate that to him, but all right. You know, you know,
[02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:18.370]  with the listeners, if you guys are listening now and this shit disappears, look for the Grow From
[02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:22.370]  Your Heart Podcast. It's the same thing. It'll be the same feed. So nothing will change. I'll,
[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:27.170]  you can type in the title on the feed and change the feed in my, uh, in my website stuff. Everything
[02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:32.370]  will be legit. It'll all stay the same other than the words. So Bender, uh, help me out, bro. I'll
[02:16:32.370 --> 02:16:37.170]  make it up to you somehow. If you got a PayPal bro, we'll hook you up. Um, Grow From Your Heart
[02:16:37.170 --> 02:16:41.250]  Podcast or the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, however you want to do it like a heart with maybe
[02:16:41.250 --> 02:16:45.570]  some herb coming out of it or whatever, dude, you know, red, gold and green. Nailed it last time.
[02:16:45.570 --> 02:16:50.770]  So nailed that last one. You know, that last logo was dope. I can't even, it kind of looks like a
[02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:57.570]  seed split and open to Jesse. Jesse just hit gold over there. A heart of a seed split and open a
[02:16:57.570 --> 02:17:02.690]  little sprout coming out of the sprout with the two leaves being the heart. Jesse's on this shit.
[02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:06.690]  Whoever can do some art. If you're in Colorado and you're an adult and you can find me face to face,
[02:17:06.690 --> 02:17:12.050]  I'll pay you in seeds or herb. I will gift you seeds and herb in return for making me this.
[02:17:12.050 --> 02:17:16.530]  I won't pay you. I can gift you shit. I can totally give you a gift of kindness to say,
[02:17:16.530 --> 02:17:21.570]  and you can also give me a gift of a sweet ass logo. You don't even know if you're not 21 and
[02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:25.570]  you're not in Colorado, I'll get you like an Irie genetics t-shirt. If I have your size in stock,
[02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.610]  I'll send you something fucking cool from Colorado to make it up for you.
[02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:32.370]  Up to you. Um, I also need a logo. I'm not begging, but I need a logo. Uh,
[02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:37.810]  or the community, man. I mean, need a theme song when it's community made nine times out of 10,
[02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:42.050]  you'll, you'll probably get a flood of stuff. You have to be like, help me pick this. You know,
[02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:46.850]  that's the problem. If you guys send theme songs, uh, grow from your heart podcast,
[02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:49.410]  that's going to, I'm going to have to, I'm just going to start saying that pretty soon here.
[02:17:49.410 --> 02:17:52.850]  That's going to be well, that way people can, I don't want to get, I don't even want to start
[02:17:52.850 --> 02:17:58.530]  hearing it. That other company that owns the name. So that was a phrase you told me one of the first
[02:17:58.530 --> 02:18:04.130]  times we like sat down and I currently talked about growing and breeding from your heart.
[02:18:04.130 --> 02:18:07.810]  Actually, I think that's what she said. Breed with love and grow from your heart. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:18:08.130 --> 02:18:12.850]  Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. I've been preaching those things for a long time. Those
[02:18:12.850 --> 02:18:16.930]  have always been kind of the truth. Yeah. And it makes your life and your cannabis.
[02:18:17.730 --> 02:18:22.530]  If you're not doing that, your dick, if you're going to grow cannabis and you're not starting
[02:18:22.530 --> 02:18:26.850]  and just like sitting in that room 24 seven, just like on your hands and knees, cross-legged,
[02:18:26.850 --> 02:18:34.130]  like you need style, like loving on them, then that's, you're not getting this part of the story.
[02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:38.050]  I'm going to write it down. It's official grow from your heart podcast. How's that grow from
[02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:43.650]  your heart? I like it. Um, we just got to get people now spread the word. That's what we're
[02:18:43.650 --> 02:18:48.770]  trying to do. Spread the word. Well, most people are listening. Most of you guys that are listening
[02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:52.050]  will, uh, you already know cause you're listening. All right. These are one of those times that we
[02:18:52.050 --> 02:18:56.930]  were talking about where I say something dumb. Um, I don't know that it's dumb. We're not even
[02:18:56.930 --> 02:19:02.850]  going to critique what you said. You can go on. We really like to pick on Adam enthusiasm. Nah,
[02:19:02.930 --> 02:19:07.090]  that's all good. Adam likes to get picked on. And what are my favorite things to do? Adam likes to
[02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:10.850]  start a rant and then he'll stare at you as he does it waiting for you to reply. And when you
[02:19:10.850 --> 02:19:14.930]  don't reply, he just puts his foot deeper in his mouth. Yeah. Just like, and then you look at him
[02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:19.730]  like, uh-huh. And it would be the perfect time right then to stop. But he has three more things
[02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:26.210]  that he really wants to cram in there. Jesus Christ. What is wrong with this asshole? My
[02:19:26.210 --> 02:19:30.210]  favorite is when we're in the car and he just starts doing it and he doesn't know if I'm silent
[02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:34.210]  because he's being a dipshit or if I'm just driving or what it is. And he's like, and blah,
[02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:39.810]  blah, blah, blah, blah. And I just, Nope, no reply. I want to see what's next. I just want to see
[02:19:39.810 --> 02:19:44.290]  what's going to come after that. Can he talk that shit? He always does. Always. He always manages
[02:19:44.290 --> 02:19:50.690]  to top his own foot in his mouth. Yeah. That's, that's why we keep you around, bro. Oh, I know.
[02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:55.090]  I'm, I'm good for a laugh every now and then working with them either with me or at me one
[02:19:55.090 --> 02:19:59.410]  of the other. And I, either way it's fun working with them this last week. I've had some good
[02:19:59.410 --> 02:20:03.490]  laughs. Yeah. And thank you man. Like for real, you put food on the plate, like for the shout
[02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:10.050]  out this week, you brother, like straight up, you guys building a new, a new play hut. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:15.250]  Playing in the dirt all day. Screwing off. I can, uh, it's the Denver bud company. Um,
[02:20:15.250 --> 02:20:21.570]  they're going to be wholesalers. Um, and, uh, thank you, you know, go and, uh, or their business
[02:20:21.570 --> 02:20:27.890]  plan is to be able to, uh, buy their brand of cannabis in dispensaries all over the, uh,
[02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:33.890]  all over the state. So, um, but yeah, there'll be opening sometime soon when we're done building it.
[02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:40.210]  Now they got a few other hurdles after that. Oh yeah. Inspections. Yeah. Uh, the hardest part in
[02:20:40.210 --> 02:20:45.570]  Colorado right now is getting damn water. Like getting water rights for your girl is a big,
[02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:52.850]  big, big deal. Yeah. We saw a huge fricking grow today out of South of Pueblo. They're all around
[02:20:52.850 --> 02:20:58.530]  us right now. If you go out a highway 96 towards wet more, there's a huge road. It's just right up
[02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:01.810]  against the highway. They're chain link fence. You can almost like flicker your fingers in it.
[02:21:01.810 --> 02:21:07.010]  When you drive, it's right up against the highway. Yeah. Oh yeah. I know which one that is. And then
[02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:12.930]  the one you guys saw down South, that thing, that place has a fricking air strip on it. I got to say
[02:21:12.930 --> 02:21:18.450]  one of the neatest I have seen is my boy, Hanky B over at the greener side dispensary on the, uh,
[02:21:19.330 --> 02:21:23.170]  I still haven't seen this. They've got a bunch of led lights going there. It's not happening right
[02:21:23.170 --> 02:21:27.810]  now, but, uh, last season towards the end of the season, they had Ellie led lights and it made that
[02:21:27.810 --> 02:21:34.210]  whole, what is it like a 60 by a hundred foot greenhouse? 60, but there are no shit. One 20s
[02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:39.250]  to the length. I can't remember the width. It's huge. It's bigger than your house. And it was
[02:21:39.250 --> 02:21:43.570]  filled with led lights. And so when the sun set right at sunset, it looked like aliens were
[02:21:43.570 --> 02:21:48.530]  invading for about a mile. It was just this big purple ball. Yeah. It was so awesome. Yeah.
[02:21:49.410 --> 02:21:53.970]  It's a neat greenhouse. That was one of the, one of the best, uh, was that forever flowering? Yes,
[02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:59.410]  shout out to forever flowering Northern altitude or hemisphere or something like that as the model
[02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:04.050]  with all the bells and whistles, all of them. Yeah. Yeah. That thing sings to you in the morning.
[02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:09.330]  All right. Um, I do have a couple of news articles. We're 35 minutes in a great,
[02:22:09.330 --> 02:22:12.530]  crazy rambling guys. I hope you like these episodes where we just come and hang out a
[02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:16.290]  little bit. The past couple of episodes have been really intense. Uh, my friend,
[02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:19.010]  hippie nurse, I haven't talked to you in quite a while. I hope you're still listening to the show.
[02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:24.770]  I hope you're well, uh, we haven't talked, just been busy, I guess. Um, she takes notes. And so
[02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:28.930]  I hope this episode, I hope you could put down your pen and just enjoy and hang out with us and
[02:22:28.930 --> 02:22:32.610]  maybe smoke a bowl or take a dad and enjoy the show. Let's do that. You guys want to take a dad
[02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:36.290]  together. All right. Whoever, if you guys are listening to like it when they, when, you know,
[02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:40.930]  we all sit around and puff and yeah. Oh shit. What was that? I don't know. I moved the email.
[02:22:40.930 --> 02:22:45.490]  Everything went fucking crazy. The wire on the wires there. Fuck. I hope that didn't happen in
[02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:49.170]  the recording. You guys. Cause we all, I hope it didn't either. Cause that's going to sound
[02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:54.850]  damn. That's like my brain exploded in my head and electricity happened. That's basically,
[02:22:54.850 --> 02:22:59.010]  I think what happened. I think we'd all just got hit by lightning through the headphones.
[02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:05.010]  Holy shit. So I have a news article too. Yeah. Um, first time ever reading a news article. So
[02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:11.490]  bear with me. I'm not reading it either, but I'll just hit the points. Uh, so basically the, um,
[02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:20.290]  good old Congress, which I believe acts as city council kind of sort of, of Washington DC is, um,
[02:23:21.330 --> 02:23:30.210]  um, one of the Congressman is thrown in a, uh, um, shit. I'm just trying to gather up some
[02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:33.810]  information here. Anyways, I've got it on my screen. If you want me to read it for you. Yeah.
[02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:40.770]  Yeah. We actually, uh, did you find it on the cannabis? Uh, Huff post is where I got it,
[02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:43.970]  but I saw it on the cannabis this morning. I'm going to take this quick dab. I got some
[02:23:43.970 --> 02:23:48.290]  live resin from the garden of Weeden. This is a, let me read you the proper name. Serious
[02:23:48.290 --> 02:23:52.450]  fucking bullshit. Gorilla. Hey, not the dab. The dab is not bullshit. We're going to read
[02:23:52.450 --> 02:23:57.010]  this bullshit. This dab is fucking for real. The, uh, the, uh, dab is some serious fucking fire.
[02:23:57.010 --> 02:24:02.930]  This is gorilla Hayes. It's moonshine. Hayes, uh, gorilla glue number four. Yes. And they were
[02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:09.570]  blasted together in the Obidos. Obidos. Shout out to emo tech dude. Emo tech sent me a brand
[02:24:09.570 --> 02:24:14.050]  new email. I've had it running basically for a week straight without turning it off. I turned
[02:24:14.050 --> 02:24:18.210]  it off when I go to bed and shit, but honestly I walk up, it's like my coffee pot. When you wake
[02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:23.250]  up, I walk up and turn it on. You spend a lot of time sitting in here. It's on a lot of feature
[02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:29.170]  for the, you know, coffee pot timer time. That'd be dope, dude. I actually put my old email on a
[02:24:29.170 --> 02:24:32.530]  timer because I used to fall asleep with it on. So I put her on a timer to shut off about three
[02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:38.290]  in the morning. This one's got a, a fucking USB port that I charged my phone on and it charges my
[02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:43.250]  iPhone so fast. I bet it does, especially the higher temperature here. You raise it up to it
[02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:52.450]  probably connected to that. Like I'm going to take this now. Yeah, it smells great. What up Spence?
[02:24:53.170 --> 02:25:01.010]  Um, somebody tell me about him, but I'm sure I will hear it. There we go. Check out a garden
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:07.810]  of weed and um, he just killed or actually Maddie did. Um, but they both did. Uh, they just killed
[02:25:07.810 --> 02:25:15.890]  some government meal of mine, man. It was amazing. Um, it had a bunch of color, quite possibly one
[02:25:15.890 --> 02:25:20.530]  of the best rounds I've ever seen of it. Um, I haven't got to grow that strain inside as much
[02:25:20.530 --> 02:25:28.450]  as I would have liked to. The stuff they post is just outrageous. I mean, what's the cross on your
[02:25:28.450 --> 02:25:37.250]  government mule? Um, it is a G 13, um, crossed with Tom Hill's deep chunk. That sounds delicious.
[02:25:38.850 --> 02:25:43.650]  Everything he makes is amazing. So we've got a little collaboration happening. Jesse is actually
[02:25:43.650 --> 02:25:47.570]  going to breed and I'm going to put the seeds in I read genetics packages and we're going to sell
[02:25:47.570 --> 02:25:52.770]  them as Irish genetics products. Cause I need some help. Uh, will that be rats on that? Will that be
[02:25:52.930 --> 02:25:56.770]  the government? You'll be involved in that project. Yeah. Yeah. That times a OG mail.
[02:25:57.810 --> 02:26:05.010]  Um, I literally don't have a name for it. Um, and you know, I'm not going to try to make up some
[02:26:05.010 --> 02:26:11.490]  crazy name to, uh, for this mail. I can just say it's, it's a really good mail. It's been proven.
[02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:17.090]  Um, it's made several crosses for some small time breeders. Um, is it the OG mail I think of?
[02:26:17.730 --> 02:26:23.490]  Um, yeah, yeah. The one we were talking about the other night. Yeah. Cool. Cool. So unfortunately,
[02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:27.490]  you know, there's not going to be anything fancy on the package in regards to, you know,
[02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:32.690]  it's just mystery mail or something like that, but the government meal, serious fire, um,
[02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:38.770]  the two cross together. It's just, it's going to be a, any, the government meals, real deep chunk
[02:26:38.770 --> 02:26:44.290]  leaning. We've got to give your mail a name. Like gauge calls his mail, uh, Joseph. So we just got
[02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:50.770]  to name it. It just needs a cool name. Henry. It could be Henry. It could be the Henry. I could be
[02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:54.450]  what it is. That was the name of the meal that I grew up next to. It was Henry the meal. You'd
[02:26:54.450 --> 02:27:00.450]  hear him every morning. That shit might've just accidentally happened. Tonya there it is. Um,
[02:27:00.450 --> 02:27:04.530]  so I'm going to read this news article, but first I want to remind myself, Oh, that's fucking
[02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:10.210]  dangerous. You can do that. That's cool. Yeah. It'll burn off emails. Love plastic. Yeah. Just
[02:27:10.210 --> 02:27:15.250]  go ahead and push it right up against there. Uh, dude, I was like sore. And when I did that,
[02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:23.330]  yeah, you were quick. Uh, I just hit 10,000 Instagram followers. I was going to write
[02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:29.090]  that down. Yeah. I'm glad you reminded me, but yeah. 10,000 Instagram followers. Thank you guys.
[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:33.970]  All 10,000 of you, or at least the 150 of you that like my pictures. What the fuck is that
[02:27:33.970 --> 02:27:40.050]  all about, dude? Can I get a goddamn like, well, you got to think though, you know, people just
[02:27:40.050 --> 02:27:43.970]  don't get on it all that often. And actually Instagram is going through and cleaning up
[02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:47.890]  spam accounts and taking off all kinds of shit. So good. I got one form.
[02:27:50.370 --> 02:27:55.250]  The one I've been pitching on the show for the past, by the way, guys, that's over grown your
[02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:59.250]  gov just because somebody, I forgot somebody had taken that. That's the only one that I've been
[02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:04.930]  pitching your Twitter and somebody else's Twitter who has got like 60 followers and hasn't posted
[02:28:05.010 --> 02:28:09.810]  in two years. Like I would think if you went there and it has nothing to do with cannabis
[02:28:09.810 --> 02:28:16.050]  and then nothing to do with anything, slowly say you properly say your Instagram, grow,
[02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:23.730]  grown your gov overgrown your gov or grown. Am I even following you? Uh, yes. You found me. I mean,
[02:28:23.730 --> 02:28:28.050]  usually people find me. It's, it's, it's definitely happened, but can we say your real name on the
[02:28:28.050 --> 02:28:32.690]  show? You're full of gas cans. Yeah. I call them gas cans. When I call him, I told my, I tell Siri,
[02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:37.090]  call Adam gas cans. Yep. That's that. That's what I heard when I was a kid. So you know what else
[02:28:37.090 --> 02:28:41.650]  is fun? Put your phone, your Siri on a British accent with a chick and it's hot, dude. Yeah.
[02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:50.290]  Call Adam gas cans. She's all bringing it like, yeah, you're kind of weird with that. I stuff.
[02:28:50.290 --> 02:28:56.610]  I know. I like my eye devices. I like them. Right. Apple call. Um, so yeah, let's read this article
[02:28:56.610 --> 02:29:01.810]  that Jesse kind of started to read. It says Obama opposes congressional effort to stop DC pot
[02:29:01.810 --> 02:29:07.090]  legalization. Oh, you mentioned that. And on the picture, it looks like he's clapping, but he's not,
[02:29:07.090 --> 02:29:11.970]  he's got this like weird facial expression. Uh, this article is from, it just says associated
[02:29:11.970 --> 02:29:16.530]  press. Nobody gets any credit here. The AP that's all. So whoever wrote it, sorry, bro. You didn't,
[02:29:16.530 --> 02:29:26.130]  nobody cared. It says president president Barack Obama plans to sign a $1.1 trillion government
[02:29:26.130 --> 02:29:30.770]  spending bill. If it reaches his desk, although he opposed a provision blocking the district of
[02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:34.690]  Columbia from legalizing marijuana, Jesse's frantically searching his phone. I may be
[02:29:34.690 --> 02:29:39.490]  reading a different article. No, same one. I just want to get that asshole Congress congressman's
[02:29:39.490 --> 02:29:45.090]  name. So awesome. A white house spokesman, Josh Ernest said Thursday that despite reservations,
[02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:50.210]  Obama is set to sign legislation to fund nearly the entire government through the end of the
[02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:55.890]  budget year, September 30th, a district voters approved an initiative, November 4th to allow
[02:29:55.890 --> 02:30:00.530]  possession of up to two ounces of pot or up to three mature plants for personal use.
[02:30:01.170 --> 02:30:05.970]  But here we go. Language inserted by Republicans in the spending bill would bar the city from
[02:30:05.970 --> 02:30:10.850]  moving forward with legalization. Ernest says the president believes Congress shouldn't interfere
[02:30:10.850 --> 02:30:16.050]  with the will of city voters on marijuana and other issues. Obama supports statehood for the
[02:30:16.050 --> 02:30:22.850]  district. So they wrote a new budget proposal by they, uh, it looks like the Republicans have
[02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:29.970]  submitted this, right? But in the wording, they also try to block the legalization of cannabis
[02:30:29.970 --> 02:30:37.410]  in the district of Columbia. So just in the city, not in the state, correct? Like, uh, you know,
[02:30:37.410 --> 02:30:40.690]  I know it's a district, but you know what I'm saying? It's like, it's the whole state. From
[02:30:40.690 --> 02:30:46.050]  what I read, it's going to be the whole state, Washington, DC. I didn't, I was speaking as I
[02:30:46.050 --> 02:30:49.650]  read it. So I may not provide provision, a lot of district of Columbia. Yeah. Yeah. It's going
[02:30:49.650 --> 02:30:53.570]  to be the only, see like the whole DC area around the white house and that, you know,
[02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:58.210]  like the presidential land, you know what I'm saying? The whole district. Yeah. So here's
[02:30:58.210 --> 02:31:04.130]  what sucks is Obama would, so it'll be legal. Obama's down with DC being legalized. He says,
[02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:08.530]  he's cool. He didn't write out his spokesperson says they have to pass the budget. They have to
[02:31:08.530 --> 02:31:12.610]  pass that budget. I couldn't find that cocksucker's name. Can't he go out? Can he just, he's the
[02:31:12.610 --> 02:31:17.570]  president, bro. Can't, why doesn't he just fucking erase that line? Um, something to do with some
[02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:21.490]  kind of bullshit. Fuck. Yeah. I'm sure. Can I be the first one to say it? Like, go ahead and say,
[02:31:21.490 --> 02:31:26.050]  I see that he decriminalizes it at least before he gets out, you know, because he was so,
[02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:32.050]  I'll leave it alone. I'll leave it alone. And then the raids and stuff, like he was here and
[02:31:32.050 --> 02:31:39.410]  he's still like, there's a war on drugs still in this, then the other. And, you know, it's,
[02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:42.130]  it's one of those things that I feel like if he's going to do anything that
[02:31:42.690 --> 02:31:47.410]  gives him a like on the way out, it'll be something along that line. If he can just
[02:31:47.410 --> 02:31:54.610]  bring it down to a new substance law, you know, I don't know. Yeah. It just sucks because he's
[02:31:54.610 --> 02:32:00.050]  got to do something before he leaves or this, uh, he's going to pass. And a spokesperson says,
[02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:04.130]  um, he believes Congress shouldn't interfere with the will of city voters on marijuana and
[02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:09.650]  other issues. And he supports statehood. Uh, what it does is it blocks, uh, any,
[02:32:09.730 --> 02:32:16.370]  it blocks, uh, any, any congressional or city money being used to implement the program.
[02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:20.930]  So it's like a shitty ultimatum. Yeah. It's just like, we don't need your money.
[02:32:20.930 --> 02:32:26.370]  They'll gladly give it to you by the droves. Have you not been paying attention? What happened to
[02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:31.810]  voting and then what the voters vote for happening? No, no. Like what happened to that?
[02:32:31.810 --> 02:32:35.890]  It's like, uh, your parents telling you, you go to a house party on Saturday when they damn well
[02:32:35.890 --> 02:32:43.570]  know you'll be in Texas. I like that. All right. Um, there's nothing I can do about it. It's in
[02:32:43.570 --> 02:32:47.890]  the president's hands. Now. I hope you guys in DC get to smoke your recreational legal cannabis,
[02:32:47.890 --> 02:32:52.450]  right? Tell them. So they won't have a store, but they can still, you know, I mean,
[02:32:53.490 --> 02:32:58.210]  fight the good fight guys. You know, what they're doing is it sounds like they're encouraging the
[02:32:58.210 --> 02:33:02.770]  gray market. You know, it sounds like that's exactly what I thought when I read the article.
[02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:07.410]  It sounds like a good place to be a caregiver in Colorado. That gray market is getting squeezed out.
[02:33:07.410 --> 02:33:11.650]  I know pot's super illegal or expensive. What's not super illegal. It's super fucking expensive
[02:33:11.650 --> 02:33:15.650]  at the dispensaries, but it seems like, uh, from hanging out in the shop as much as I have been
[02:33:15.650 --> 02:33:21.410]  lately, there are a lot of people that would rather just go to the dispensary shop from the jars.
[02:33:21.410 --> 02:33:25.810]  There are like 12 strains on the shot on the shelf at the shop. You don't get choice. Honestly,
[02:33:25.810 --> 02:33:31.330]  in my opinion, it's too expensive, but that's because I'm a spoiled. I grow my own herb. I
[02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:36.370]  know what it costs. I've been paying really low prices for several years now. And to go there and
[02:33:36.370 --> 02:33:41.810]  it's double a little more than double what I'm used to paying, but it's legal, but you don't
[02:33:41.810 --> 02:33:46.290]  have to wait for anybody. You have to sit in a cushy, comfy chair and listen to decent reggae
[02:33:46.290 --> 02:33:50.450]  music. They play good reggae there too. That has nothing to do with me. Uh, you sit in these cozy
[02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:54.370]  little chairs and chill out and it's a chill environment. And if you don't want to wait for
[02:33:54.370 --> 02:33:58.450]  your dude to show up, if you just want to grab an eighth on the way home from work, if you don't
[02:33:58.450 --> 02:34:01.490]  want it because the deals are sketchy in a parking lot and shit, you don't want to be doing that
[02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:06.130]  anymore. Just go to that. It's, I can see the black and gray markets just being, and I'm telling you,
[02:34:06.130 --> 02:34:12.450]  they would be, they would be totally wiped out. I feel if it was accessible in every street corner,
[02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:17.170]  you know, almost like a damn liquor store where there's, you know, 13 of them in town spread out
[02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:22.850]  instead of, you know, 14 of them out there in two mile area. And I mean, that's just hard.
[02:34:22.850 --> 02:34:27.010]  You guys in States that are just about to legalize her that are pushing it. You got to get on top of
[02:34:27.010 --> 02:34:32.930]  shit. The day it pops, you got to get your shop open because you have to start making enough money
[02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:37.410]  to comply with the regulations that are coming. Because now that Colorado has set the standard,
[02:34:37.410 --> 02:34:41.890]  other places are just kind of adopting that. Uh, they're just saying, Colorado's doing this. They
[02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:45.730]  kind of set it around that. They're not making the same mistakes as well. They already have a
[02:34:45.730 --> 02:34:50.050]  template. You're not getting what we used to call here was the wild, wild West that I talk about.
[02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:54.050]  Jesse knows the wild, wild West real well. The good old days grow the quarter pounds in the
[02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:59.330]  houses, rent other houses, grow weed in there, take that weed to shops and sell it to the shop
[02:34:59.330 --> 02:35:02.930]  straight up for cash. I'd walk in with the backpack full of pounds. If I had a variety,
[02:35:02.930 --> 02:35:06.610]  if I had five or six quarter pounds, I could sell all of those quarter pounds for
[02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:10.690]  like 700, seven 50, a quarter pound dude. And walk out with cash back in the day.
[02:35:10.690 --> 02:35:14.610]  Yeah. There was a handful of shops here in town and in the area that
[02:35:16.850 --> 02:35:23.090]  really, I guess only one of them survived, but, um, uh, well too, um, but, uh,
[02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:30.770]  um, you know, that's, they didn't have girl rooms. I mean, they, they got stuff from guys like me and
[02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:36.290]  Jeff and it was totally legal at the time. I had a job. That was all, you know, medical. And it
[02:35:36.290 --> 02:35:40.930]  isn't that what people just went out and got their med cards and they, you know, that's, that's what
[02:35:40.930 --> 02:35:45.730]  they did. Yeah. But in that kind of squeeze the gray market here, did it not like in town just
[02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:51.970]  because it was accessible when inside city limits, we made our dispensary public, we had a dispensary
[02:35:51.970 --> 02:35:55.250]  that we kept slightly private. We didn't let a lot of people know about it. It was in a little
[02:35:55.250 --> 02:35:59.810]  kind of thing and private clubs or nothing new, but eventually we decided let's take this to the
[02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:04.770]  big, big room in our retail store and just kind of show that this is what we're doing. Uh, we drop
[02:36:04.770 --> 02:36:10.290]  prices in this town dramatically. Uh, it was 400 bucks an ounce for any kind of kind bud for a
[02:36:10.290 --> 02:36:15.970]  while around here. Uh, about 10 years ago, 10 or 12 years ago, 400 bucks an ounce, that's our diesel
[02:36:15.970 --> 02:36:21.890]  that we smoke 400 bucks an ounce dude for 28 grams, no love. Uh, you'd sell it for 60 bucks
[02:36:21.890 --> 02:36:26.530]  an eighth and they'd be 3.4. You know what I mean? He would need no love on that bag at all.
[02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:32.130]  And then we got the shop going. And when we first did it, ounces were three 50 just to keep us in
[02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:35.730]  business. Cause we were selling out, you know, and then we had, we had a big outdoor harvest
[02:36:35.730 --> 02:36:41.170]  and we dropped down ounces down to three 20 and then our patients were paying two 80. And then,
[02:36:41.170 --> 02:36:45.650]  uh, we were seeing better quality because a lot of our stuff was outdoor. We're growing a large
[02:36:45.650 --> 02:36:49.730]  outdoor and we saw the competitors, the two shops that are still around, they were getting good
[02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:53.890]  indoor and stuff. I couldn't grow enough to keep it on our shelves. We had a downtown location.
[02:36:53.890 --> 02:37:00.450]  We were banging. So we dropped prices to 200 bucks an ounce at one point. And that up the whole town.
[02:37:00.450 --> 02:37:05.650]  I was getting hate mail, hate calls, death threats. Like people were mad at me because I was
[02:37:05.650 --> 02:37:10.050]  the one, I was the face of that shop. They thought it was all me kind of was, but yeah,
[02:37:10.050 --> 02:37:15.090]  we off the town and drop prices. Now, now you can score a good ounce in this town for 200 bucks and
[02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:18.610]  people still want to find cheaper ounces. They're out there, but for the good dank, it's about
[02:37:18.610 --> 02:37:24.370]  dispensary prices. Usually, you know, depending on where you go, it's about four 15 ounce right
[02:37:24.370 --> 02:37:29.730]  now at the spot. I think for a good day counts, they got some good Durban poison though. I would,
[02:37:29.730 --> 02:37:34.130]  if I had to smoke one, that's what I'd go for. I mean, I've thought about it. One more news article.
[02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:37.170]  I've mentioned the part about Seth Rogan. We may get to that. We may not, you guys,
[02:37:37.170 --> 02:37:40.530]  Seth Rogan wanted to come to Denver and do a smoke out for his new movie. Uh, they wouldn't
[02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:44.370]  let him smoke. That's kind of the quick version. You can't smoke in a public place anymore. He had
[02:37:44.370 --> 02:37:48.690]  to serve tequila. Shitty. All right. So this one is cool. Uh, department of justice ruling.
[02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:54.050]  Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. We'll get, we'll get, we'll try to read that one. We will. Since you just said
[02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:58.930]  that, uh, Indian tribes can legalize pot on their lands. Uh, and then the sub headline, if tribes
[02:37:58.930 --> 02:38:03.890]  can balance all the potential social issues, it could be a really huge opportunity says Seattle
[02:38:03.890 --> 02:38:08.690]  attorney, Anthony Broadman, whose firm represents tribal governments throughout the West. So this
[02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:13.570]  article was published on December 11th. It's written by Jeff Bernard and Garcia was NACIA
[02:38:13.570 --> 02:38:18.770]  from the associated press. Uh, it says the U S department of justice said Thursday that American
[02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:22.770]  Indian tribes can grow and sell marijuana on their lands. As long as they follow the same
[02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:27.730]  federal conditions laid out for States that have legalized the drug Oregon, U S attorney, Amanda
[02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:32.290]  Marshall said Thursday, the announcement addresses questions raised by tribes about how legalization
[02:38:32.290 --> 02:38:36.130]  of pot in States like Oregon, Washington, and Colorado would apply to Indian lands.
[02:38:37.330 --> 02:38:41.090]  Only three tribes have expressed interest in growing and selling marijuana said Marshall,
[02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:45.490]  who co-chaired a group that developed the policy. One is in California, one in Washington
[02:38:46.050 --> 02:38:50.850]  and one state in the Midwest that she did not name. Uh, that's been the primary message tribes
[02:38:50.850 --> 02:38:56.050]  are getting to us as U S attorneys. Marshall said from Portland, what will the U S as federal
[02:38:56.050 --> 02:38:59.970]  partners do to assist tribes in protecting our children and families, our tribal businesses,
[02:38:59.970 --> 02:39:04.450]  our tribal housing, how will you help us combat marijuana abuse in Indian country
[02:39:04.450 --> 02:39:08.130]  or Indian County when States are no longer there to partner with us?
[02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:11.730]  Marijuana abuse. Do you guys see a lot of that
[02:39:13.970 --> 02:39:18.450]  over here? Yeah. A lot of abuse over here. Right? Yeah. Because you're just like fucking,
[02:39:18.450 --> 02:39:23.090]  Oh, that, that four grams of scissor hash. I don't need that. I'll just throw that in the trash.
[02:39:23.810 --> 02:39:29.330]  That makes me laugh because I'm thinking about what does get abused on Indian reservations.
[02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:33.330]  I've been on, I was going to ask you, how do you feel about that too? You know, since they're
[02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:38.370]  allowed to do everything that they're, you know, now they're, they're making money in collecting
[02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:45.570]  tax for the state, but that all that land is tax free. Like, I don't, I'm with that, you know,
[02:39:45.570 --> 02:39:52.930]  like we've fucking stolen the whole West from them, but like, if you're going to make money,
[02:39:52.930 --> 02:39:56.610]  but if you're going to sell it to the public as like Indian grown herb,
[02:39:58.690 --> 02:40:02.850]  you should at least pay tax on the land. That's it's doing that. You know what I'm saying? Like
[02:40:02.850 --> 02:40:07.410]  for your plot, I don't think this really approaches that I'm sure the state would still
[02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:10.850]  require. They're definitely going to take taxes for the herb, but not for the, for the land.
[02:40:10.850 --> 02:40:15.090]  They can't, you can't retax. That's the whole problem with having an Indian business on the
[02:40:15.090 --> 02:40:19.730]  ball. And though is that's, that's the fight they've been fighting for many years is they won't
[02:40:19.730 --> 02:40:24.130]  let them have any kind of businesses on there. That's going to prove profitable. You know,
[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:27.570]  when they open a casino or something like that, it's not on Indian land. It's on,
[02:40:28.370 --> 02:40:32.930]  you know, some outskirt land that they've had to buy like separately and pay land tax on.
[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:38.370]  That's, that's been one of the large arguments that I've, I've at least seen over the past
[02:40:38.370 --> 02:40:41.490]  couple of years. I don't know enough about that to argue you. All right. So you went,
[02:40:41.490 --> 02:40:46.210]  all right, no, I was asking you. Good job. I'm giving you credit. The Southern boy just made a
[02:40:46.210 --> 02:40:55.250]  point. Maybe 44, 44 getting it done. Episode 44 hop because it sounds like we're razzing each
[02:40:55.570 --> 02:40:59.170]  other. We just are. Cause we're bros. Sorry. Don't get mad at us. I'm going to give him a
[02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:02.930]  fucking wedgie in a minute. Whoa. So hard that you can read Haines on his forehead. You ever
[02:41:02.930 --> 02:41:07.090]  had that kind of just pull it up right over your forehead. Took a shoe in the back. You reach over
[02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:11.410]  here and look for underwear. And when you find it, it's going to be really weird for you. Ladies and
[02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:15.970]  gentlemen, this is the episode with too much information. Yeah. All right. I'm going to try
[02:41:15.970 --> 02:41:21.250]  to read this article with the throw up. That's in my, in my mouth. Um, Marshall warned, uh,
[02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:24.770]  warned the announcement is not a green light to tribal authorities and that marijuana is still
[02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:29.810]  illegal under federal law. The U S government's prosecution priorities involve pot related gang
[02:41:29.810 --> 02:41:35.250]  activity, violence, sales to kids and trafficking will continue. She said problems could arise for
[02:41:35.250 --> 02:41:39.410]  tribes with lands in States that still outlaw marijuana due to the likelihood that marijuana
[02:41:39.410 --> 02:41:44.370]  could be transported or sold outside tribal boundaries. She added Seattle attorney, Anthony
[02:41:44.370 --> 02:41:48.130]  Broadman, whose firm represents tribal governments throughout the West said the announcement
[02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:53.410]  represents a potential for enormous economic developable development tool here. Uh, yeah.
[02:41:53.410 --> 02:41:57.970]  If tribes can balance all the potential social issues, it can be a really huge opportunity.
[02:41:57.970 --> 02:42:01.410]  You're going to have to pay. I think they'll be able to handle it. There's a, I want to read this
[02:42:01.410 --> 02:42:05.330]  one next paragraph and then we can rant on the part that's the elephant in the room. But those
[02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:10.210]  social issues are monumental. Indian tribes have been decimated by drug abuse. Broadman said,
[02:42:10.210 --> 02:42:15.410]  tribal regulations of pot are going to have to dovetail with tribal values, making sure marijuana
[02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:21.570]  isn't a scourge like alcohol or tobacco. All right. I'm going to sound racist. Maybe
[02:42:21.570 --> 02:42:27.250]  generalization. We all know that natives have trouble with alcohol, not all of them, but the
[02:42:27.250 --> 02:42:34.770]  ones that do really fucking do. Uh, alcohol is a horrible thing that ruins tons of lives, not just
[02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:40.450]  native Americans. The problem is that you concentrate them in one area and then you look
[02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:48.450]  at them from afar and then you notice similarities and stereotypes just as in any race or okay.
[02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:57.120]  How is herb going to be a big problem on a, I'm frustrated. I'm, I've never seen a reservation.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.720]  We've seen that it works. It's working in Washington. Hasn't blown up yet. Let's try
[02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:07.840]  to replace the alcohol abuse on the reservation with some cannabis enjoyment and then maybe
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:11.120]  the problems that are associated with alcohol abuse. I've got a whole list of them. They could
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:14.560]  have another podcast planned. We could talk about for, I got five hours. Could you not look at
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:21.760]  Alaska almost in that same way? I mean, Alaskans aren't, aren't native American, but I mean,
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:29.520]  a lot of the people up there like Alaska, Utah, Arizona, uh, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado,
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:35.200]  all those tribes, like, I mean, really, really bad problems. Um, or I mean, not to sound like
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:41.760]  a dick, but I mean, I've been around a reservation or two, so, um, but, uh, yeah, no, I just, I think
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:46.320]  it'd be an awesome development thing for them. Yeah. It's economical development for sure. And
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:50.400]  they're fucking right. Getting back to the land. I mean, yeah. All right. So let's read about these
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.720]  taxes part of the tax bar here. It says tribe selling marijuana may not be subject to state
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  and local taxes, allowing them to undercut off reservation sales. Also, maybe not in Washington
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:08.080]  taxes at 25% of the price of pot also in Colorado. Uh, but Alison Holcomb Holcomb,
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:11.760]  yeah, I said that, right. A primary drafter of Washington state's legalization measure
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:16.480]  said most people in larger States won't want to drive to far flung reservations to buy pot.
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:21.360]  You're crazy. Dude. Imagine that Indian dank weed. What was the, was it here on the podcast that we
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:26.560]  had the statistic where we got $30 million just in recreational sales this year? And that came
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:30.960]  from out of state or 70% of that came from out of state. And then every time I go in and talk
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:37.280]  to the security guard at any dispensary, Texas, fucking Texas, I guarantee you 50% of that was
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:42.000]  Texas. I'm going to go kind of fast because we're approaching an hour. The Yucama nation. I'm,
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.920]  I said that wrong Yucama nation. Sorry. I apologize. And Washington state recently
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:50.160]  passed a ban on marijuana on the reservation and is trying to halt state regulated pot sales and
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:54.000]  grows on lands off the reservation where it still holds hunting and fishing rights.
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:57.680]  So they don't want you growing where they can hunt and fish with, which makes sense.
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:02.000]  I wonder if there's actually a conflict with that or if it's just politics.
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.760]  Some of us, they don't want to find our botanic air bottles in their hunting grounds.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:09.200]  Well, yeah, no, no. I just don't wonder if there's actually anyone that wants to grow
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.760]  in their hunting grounds. It actually says the Hoopa Valley tribe in Northern California has
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:18.720]  battled illegal pot plantations on its reservation where they cause environmental damage. But you
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:23.440]  know, that's illegal at any rate. There are 566 tribes around the country recognized. I'm going
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:26.720]  to go fast and scam recognized by federal government. There's going to be a lot of
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:30.720]  consulting happening. Yes, for sure. Limited resources and a vast amount of territory to
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:36.320]  cover. Federal prosecutors will not prosecute minor cases. Yay. Tribal policy is based on the
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:41.280]  so-called Cole memo named after the deputy attorney general who wrote it in which justice
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:45.120]  department said the federal government wouldn't intervene as long as legalization states tightly
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:49.440]  regulate the drug and take steps to keep it from children, criminal cartels and federal property.
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.400]  In all the memo said U.S. attorneys reserved the right to prosecute for eight issues,
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:59.840]  sales to kids, marijuana proceeds going to criminal enterprises, shipping marijuana to
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:04.640]  other states where it is illegal. Guys quit doing that shit. Yeah. Illegal sales. News about
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:10.000]  that firearms and violence, drug driving and other health issues, growing marijuana on public lands
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.920]  and possession of marijuana on federal property. So hopefully eventually they're going to let the
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:20.800]  Indians, the natives, you guys, the natives will be able to grow on their land and maybe have their
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:25.920]  own Indian dispensary. I think they grow some dank bro. That's what they do. They're an agricultural
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:32.080]  yeah. Yeah. They're agricultural people. They would make the dank. I'm sure there would
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:36.400]  maybe ones that would abuse it just like anywhere else. But for the most part, I bet they would be
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:40.160]  real respectful about it. You know what I'm saying? I mean, that's if you have, have they not, have
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:45.920]  they not like use that as ceremonial herb? I mean, I, I don't know. I don't know what they use,
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:49.040]  but I'm sure if you gave it to him, it'd be the perfect thing. That's what the Ross does use for
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:55.840]  meditation for a reason. Yeah. Um, I don't think that it was around, but you know, it'd be a more
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:02.240]  modern wild in Iowa, you know, like if you want to get technical, the three of us abuse cannabis.
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:07.440]  Like if we were to say we're medical patients, that's the dab we just took was way beyond
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:12.240]  medicine. Now I'm high as shit. First it was medicine. I'm a medical patient for stress.
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:17.920]  Abusive. We are look at what the problems we're causing. We're loud mouths with microphones.
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:22.240]  I had to take a nap on the couch the other night because I took too many dabs. Like
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:28.080]  if it had been whiskey or something like that, you know, or if I could, yeah, I mean, yeah,
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.400]  we'd have fucking trashed the neighbor's house. Fucking. Yep. All right. So I'm going to quickly,
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:37.920]  we're going to go over an hour guys. I hope you can stick with us. Thanks for hanging in for the
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:42.720]  random chatter episode, which is my, what might be what I name it. Uh, so Seth Rogan, I've got two
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:46.400]  articles here. There was an article posted on December 8th and then there was a follow-up
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.400]  posted. Uh, let me click it to read the next date. Uh, this one came out December 9th. So the night
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:57.040]  of the eighth must've been the event. Uh, Seth Rogan says he will, this is from Ricardo Baca,
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:01.440]  Baca at the cannabis. Seth Rogan says he will screen his new film Monday night in a Denver
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.760]  movie theater filled with marijuana smoke and hundreds of his fans, but will movie theater hot
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:09.520]  box actually happen? While Rogan has said he thinks it should happen. The city of Denver's
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:13.600]  executive director of marijuana policy thinks the screening should obey Colorado law,
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:21.120]  sans the marijuana smoke. Um, so he planned on debuting his new movie at the Oriental theater
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.280]  and he tweeted about it. Actually. He said, we're going to all get stoned in the theater.
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.600]  And that was kind of a bad idea because that can't really happen because of the rules here in
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:33.680]  Colorado. They are super strict about that kind of shit. So first Rogan started tweeting about
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:38.960]  getting high inside the Colorado theater with his fans. Then the host venue, uh, the Psy Film Center
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:43.280]  on East Colfax Avenue contacted Sony to tell them the audience couldn't light up inside their space
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:47.600]  as it would be against Colorado law. Then Sony told the film center, the evening was no longer
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.840]  happening. The cannabis cannabis reported that Rogan responded via Twitter, that a Colorado
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:56.000]  screening would still happen only at a different theater. The old video is acting lame. So we got
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.200]  a new one. Rogan tweeted. Uh, so where will Rogan land tonight? And remember this is from a few
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:06.880]  nights ago. Uh, the Oriental theater owner, Scott Labrera, who dude, we've had some rage and dab
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.640]  parties in the Oriental theater. That's where the first dabs of Denver event was for the secret cup
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:17.040]  used to be held. Uh, there's a video on the IRI genetics YouTube channel of me taking a fat dab
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.520]  inside. I took the first dab in there. As far as I know, uh, started that party up with a big old
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:26.160]  dab. So, um, then he says tonight's video is private and close to the general public and
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:32.080]  two promoters who regularly booked the North Denver room, um, for a pot friendly comedy
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:35.840]  shows confirmed that Rogan screening is scheduled to happen there on Monday night.
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.200]  So it's at the Oriental theater owner of Denver pot shop, Denver relief and comedy production
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:44.800]  group, sex, bot comedy told the cannabis. We don't know if there will be any sort of
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:49.760]  consumption or anything. I'm going to skip a couple of things. Uh, we're going to scroll
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:53.520]  through. So he was planning to come and watch this new movie, which I still haven't read the
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:57.440]  name of. They have not advertised the name of his movie in this article at all. Uh,
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:03.760]  isn't it the interview? I think so. It looks hilarious. I don't watch TV. So I don't see
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.400]  the commercial story. So there's no provision in amendment 64 for the on-premise consumption of
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:12.880]  marijuana. Kilroy said that could have been put in amendment 64, but it wasn't. So the voters did
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:17.440]  not vote for it. So Kilroy said the Denver police department and the city's department of excise and
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.680]  license have historically contacted businesses, advertising pot friendly parties ahead of time
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.400]  to talk about potential violations. We've educated people on what the law is said Kilroy and we've
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.720]  gotten compliance generally, but asked if they were aware of Rogan's event and without even
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:35.440]  mentioning the Oriental as a possible location, Kilroy's office told the cannabis that Denver
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:40.560]  police would reach out to the Oriental theaters owners sometime Monday. So that was the original
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:45.760]  article. He was going to come, he was going to puff, right? So on the next, uh, publishing day,
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:50.960]  the ninth, uh, Jack Brown from the cannabis said his article, article highline, no weed,
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:56.320]  plenty of tequila at the interview in Denver with Seth Rogan. So there was one thing everyone could
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:51:02.640]  smell Monday night at the Denver screening of the interview tequila. So that sucks, dude. They had to
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:09.200]  not puff and they had to serve tequila. What would happen if we replaced every dab we've taken on the
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:12.960]  podcast and before the podcast with a shot of tequila, how do you think our night would have
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.680]  gone? I had to probably piss myself by now and thrown up somewhere because that's what tequila
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:22.880]  makes me do. I would have been really mad and violent about it. Right? Yeah. Honestly, you think
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:28.640]  you give me shit about dabs, dude. I'm even more of a pussy when it comes to liquor beer. I can,
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.440]  I can deal with, but you don't have to be not being able to drink tequila does not mean you're
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:42.000]  a pussy. So this guy, my old lady pounds the rest of the bottle. Yeah, it does. Yeah. Yeah. Let's
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:45.680]  not bring her into this. All right. So the article goes on and says, when I ran into Rogan on the top
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:50.160]  floor of the theater in Northwest Denver, he was adamant that the show was not how he had imagined
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:56.320]  the December 8th event, which had been hyped by Rogan on social media as a four 20 friendly affair.
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.680]  The city said, they shut us down. If there was any smoking, he said with the bottle of
[02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:05.520]  Juarez tequila in hand, but I can't control what you guys do. Uh, says Rogan. Couldn't maybe,
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:11.360]  but Rogan couldn't, but maybe the what's that cadre cater. I'd have never seen that word.
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.520]  The big ass group of secret secret service as security personnel definitely enforced the
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.400]  Colorado clean indoor air rules, asking several people in my section to leave during the screening
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:25.040]  for using vape pens. There were also rumored to be a number of undercover police officers in the
[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:29.760]  crowd in case there was any smoking taking place. As this is the shit that happened in Colorado.
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:33.200]  You think you're going to go somewhere and puff. Be careful, dude. It's not going to happen at the
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:38.720]  Oriental theater. And the places it does happen at, we keep our mouth shut about because we like
[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:44.080]  doing it there. That's kind of true. Kind of true. You don't see pictures of people standing around
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:48.160]  in circles and sidewalks, you know, like it's just not something that we take pictures of.
[02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:51.760]  If you're here and you're cool and we know you and stuff, we'll grab you and take you to a place.
[02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:55.840]  Don't be shy. Well, you'll definitely come with us. You know, the cops don't go in the mountains
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:02.240]  here. Don't blow our dab spots. We found some really cool adventurous dabs. So as the duo took
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:06.720]  stage, Rogan started things off by saying, fuck the police, which elicited big cheers from the
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:12.080]  pro pot crowd. Audience questions range from actual threats by North Korea over the film,
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:16.080]  because Rogan having North Korea threatened nuclear war is not ideal yet. We won't even go
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:20.320]  into that part. So Rogan made sure to correct the question about smoking bowls. He said,
[02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:26.400]  first I smoked joints five to seven a day on a night that was light on both joints and bowls.
[02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:30.880]  More were left simply handing him various pot products for later. And the state that
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:37.280]  is famously, that famously legalized it. Most of the weed smoking surreptitious, surrepetitiously,
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:41.680]  that's a good fucking word, took place in a side alley next to the theater. Maybe next year,
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:46.800]  Rogan exclaimed the way things are trending with pot consumption enforcement, perhaps next year
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:53.200]  looks even worse. Yeah. They're really cracking down. We can't puff here in Colorado. You have to
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:57.680]  be in a private house. They want you at home smoking your pot. It's pretty much the only
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:03.440]  place they want you doing it, which there are a few hotels, sorry, that advertise for 24. They do
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:08.320]  our favorite hotel that we drive past that we see that advertised. I don't remember the name. It's
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:12.240]  in Manitou Springs. It's right outside of Manitou. As we head back from the Monte factory,
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:17.200]  you see the four 20 friendly sign. They've taken down the four 20 friendly part. It no longer says
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:22.080]  that they're probably still four 20 friendly, but they probably had to just quit advertising such
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:28.320]  just to keep themselves out of trouble. Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, micro-till micro-till here in
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:32.240]  Puebla is four 20. Yeah, they are. I've got a friend that works over there. What's up D if
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:37.520]  you're listening, shout out bro. Shout out to big D and little D. Yeah. I think we stayed there.
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:43.680]  First got over this way. They only have a couple of rooms that are actually four 20 friendly.
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:50.560]  Right. If you just ask, I mean, and if they say no, then there's, there's measurements to take,
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:54.800]  but yeah. All right guys, it looks like it's about time to wrap up the show. We've been going
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:58.400]  for an hour and seven minutes. I hope your ADD didn't kick in. I hope you made it through the
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.960]  whole show. Don't forget to check out all of our sponsors guys. Pretty soon. We'll have King Cola
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:06.960]  back on the show to talk more about organics. We have a couple of questions about map and DAP for
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:12.400]  him. Um, we're going to do eventually, um, we're going to do an additives lesson. I promise you,
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:16.160]  since I've taken this new job at the spot, being the master grower, I do promise you
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:19.440]  that it will not deter or detract from the podcast. We're still going to do our best to
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:23.920]  put out kick-ass podcasts. It may actually help me do some hydro lessons for you because everything
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:29.440]  we're doing there is on large scale commercial hydro. I get to kind of expand my hydro knowledge.
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:33.440]  We're going to do lessons on additives. I may have said that. I don't know if I read that line,
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:37.840]  like what to add to your shit during what week so that you know when to boost it.
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:42.080]  Uh, we talked about basic news. Now we need to talk about additives. We're working towards episode
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:48.480]  50 also 50 is going to be fun. It'd just be like a recap. We just like celebrating 25. I think so
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:53.280]  25 weeks ago. So if you guys have been listening for a long time and you've got some favorite,
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:58.640]  uh, moments of the show or some highlights or something and a highlight reel, um, message me
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:02.080]  and let me know when that was. And we can talk about it. We'll kind of reminisce on episode 50.
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:07.200]  See who we can't get to the show. Maybe I can set up like 22 microphones and get everybody that's
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:11.840]  ever been on, onto the show all at once or something. Have another spot like you, you did,
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:15.120]  you know, like we did at the brickyard to try to find a public place. Maybe we can do that.
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:20.240]  There is not going to be, go ahead. Let's give away something free. Oh, yeah.
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.800]  Hydro indoor growing supplies is going to step it up and give away something. Awesome. I like that.
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.680]  Something cool. And I'm sure you got, you know, yeah, I got a t-shirt or a hat pin or some
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:33.600]  stickers and stuff, you know, it's going to be awesome. Cool. Are you guys got any
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:39.280]  shout outs or anything to make? Um, mine was for you, man, honestly. Uh, and you know, like
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:46.720]  vendor, of course he's keeping the service running. So, Hey Fisher cut faster. See, I feel bad for him
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.560]  now because he was like, I don't want to listen to your voice, you know, last week. And now he's
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:55.920]  going to have to listen to both of our voices this week. So how long can we go on and just sit
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:59.200]  here and give it a shit and just be in the other room, just set him up with the microphone and
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  just walk away. He's a rapper. He's a rapper. Fish is a rapper. He's tired of hearing your
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:11.280]  voice on a recording. Tell him to have some sympathy. He expects everyone to listen to him
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:17.040]  rapping the same shit over and over. He just likes to complain about everything. So that's
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:21.360]  what it's all good. That's what when he goes to work is like, nevermind. I'm like, I'll say it.
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:25.040]  This is a semi family friendly podcast.
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.920]  All right. I just went almost full construction talk on you.
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:35.280]  It's a love, hate relationship. They got, you know what I'm saying? They love to piss each
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:41.040]  other the fuck right off. It's unique. I'll tell you that much. It makes it fun. Makes work fun.
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.400]  Oh, it does. All right. Don't kill each other at work. You guys would have fish shout out.
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:48.240]  Uh, let me know when you're performing. Give him a shout out.
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:56.320]  Um, uh, dank, you know, grows, um, yeah. Uno like Spanish. So
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:03.440]  all right. Um, I did most of my shout outs at the beginning. I want to thank you guys for coming on
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:08.880]  number 44, bro. Hey, thank you, man. Like I was sitting at home eating dinner. So yeah,
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:13.280]  like podcast and I'm, I'm always down planning a podcast. I really had shit planned out. It
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:16.560]  doesn't sound like it on this side. You brought him because at least he had something going on.
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:22.240]  Jesse's so damn cool that he messaged me around six with podcast. And I was like, yeah, dude,
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:25.360]  we'll do that. I wasn't going to bug him. I wasn't going to have him come over and just going to let
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.960]  him do his night, but he wanted to. So I'm so glad he came to thank you guys for coming. I always
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:32.560]  did. Uh, make sure you listen all the way up to episode number 50 guys. It sounds like high
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:38.480]  grow is going to have some sort of prizes for us. I'm thinking of light set up. So I don't know.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:44.560]  Depends on shipping and stuff like that. We'll figure it out though. So email me some of your
[02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:48.080]  favorite moments and stuff, guys, which you want to talk about on episode 50. We'll reminisce.
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:52.240]  We'll, we'll have a lot of fun on number 50. We'll take a lot of dabs. Maybe that'll be the
[02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:57.440]  one when I take like a half gram dab at the end of the show or a gram dab show because I need to
[02:58:57.440 --> 02:59:03.520]  retire this big ass dab phase. It's been going on in my life. It's uh, it, it hurts now. Like it's
[02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:07.120]  starting to, it's starting to kill me. Can we play like fiddle music or something? You know,
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:14.880]  like some violin soft instrumental shit. Yeah. Monte music. Oh dude. Big, huge shout out to the
[02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:19.120]  Monte factor. I got some, uh, loose leaf Monte in a bag to take. I mean, last time,
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:23.680]  no guys are super kind dude. The next time I go there, I may stray from the Monte. I might try a
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:28.240]  child. I may try a chai. My buddy that works there last time I was putting honey in my Monte
[02:59:28.240 --> 02:59:32.960]  and he gave me the, and I went over there and he's making himself a chai like for him.
[02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:36.240]  And he poured a little bit of it into a little to go cup for me. And he goes, try this. It's
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:41.360]  the chai. And he was just like, get out of here. Take this. Love it. I was on my way out and dude,
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:45.840]  it was the dankness. I mean, he did. What time is it? It's nine o'clock. How much,
[02:59:45.840 --> 02:59:50.400]  how much crack was in it? I don't think there was much, but I've had her. He got you hooked though.
[02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:54.720]  He's got his own special kind of crack. It was so tasty. It had the delicious. Don't be looking at
[02:59:54.720 --> 02:59:58.160]  the clock because I'm, I'm down. I'm going to call. I don't have to see if she wants to go. I
[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:01.680]  don't have money right now, but it's not out of like a milk jug or something. They actually like
[03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:05.680]  make their own. They make everything there. They make everything there. The Monte factor
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:09.360]  Amanda two Springs. You guys, it's my little secret. If you go there, tell them, Hey, I heard
[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:13.600]  about this place from the I grow culture podcast and they don't know who I am. There's a flyer.
[03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:20.320]  There's a flyer back there. Nice. All right. We're we're going so long. Jeez. I hope you guys all,
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:23.040]  I'm not going to edit this. This is how it's going to go out to you guys. There's no editing
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:25.920]  in the shows lately. I'm kind of proud of it. We're not cutting anything out and it's going
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.080]  to go out just like it happened. It's been a while actually. Yeah. So we're going to do this.
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.640]  Stop recording one time, a couple of shows ago,
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:39.360]  Jesse turned like olive green on me. Now he's construction worker. Red.
[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:44.560]  My shout outs all go to Angela, my trimmer friends, Mike and Adam here.
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:53.040]  It still is overgrow the gov on Instagram. Just not Twitter. I'm going to do that. Do your stuff.
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:57.760]  That's my shout out. Once you pointed out that just Adam's Mike is off now.
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:04.000]  Put you back on, bro. I'm just picking on you. I wouldn't do that to you. That sounds
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.480]  rude. It feels rude as fuck. All right guys. Now that the show is over, it pretty much is over,
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:11.920]  but please do listen to this part because it means a lot to me. I like you here till the end.

[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:23.440]  All right, podcast world. That was episodes 42, 43, and 44 of what used to be known as the iGrow
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:27.600]  Culture podcast, now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I hope you enjoyed it.

[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:52.400]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:03:30.270 --> 03:03:34.190]  But there seems to be a beat I can feel it in my feet
[03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:36.750]  Listen here it comes again
[03:03:37.390 --> 03:03:46.080]  So
[03:04:16.290 --> 03:04:17.410]  Sun went down
[03:04:20.930 --> 03:04:25.370]  The moon came up in white
[03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:27.370]  Stars were spinning dizzy
[03:04:27.370 --> 03:04:29.370]  Lord, the band kept us so busy
[03:04:29.370 --> 03:04:42.520]  We forgot about the time
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:46.400]  And beyond description
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:50.940]  Like Jehovah's favorite choir
[03:04:50.940 --> 03:04:53.440]  People joining hand in hand
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:55.740]  While the music plays the band
[03:04:55.740 --> 03:05:00.180]  Lord, they're setting us on fire
[03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:04.480]  Crazy rooster crowing midnight
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:08.960]  Balls of lightning roll along
[03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:11.560]  Old men sing about their dreams
[03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:13.900]  Women laugh and children scream
[03:05:13.900 --> 03:05:19.140]  And the band keeps playing on
[03:05:19.140 --> 03:05:23.540]  People dancing through the night
[03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:28.580]  Reading the morning and the sun
[03:05:28.580 --> 03:05:32.740]  No one's noticed but the band's all packed and gone
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:36.280]  Was it ever here before?
[03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:46.300]  But they kept on dancing
[03:05:46.300 --> 03:05:48.340]  Come on children, come on children
[03:05:48.340 --> 03:05:54.660]  Come on clap your hands
[03:05:54.660 --> 03:05:58.960]  And the cool breeze came on Tuesday
[03:05:58.960 --> 03:06:03.530]  And the corn's a bumper crop
[03:06:03.530 --> 03:06:06.030]  And the fields are full of dancing
[03:06:06.050 --> 03:06:08.350]  Full of singing and romancing
[03:06:08.350 --> 03:06:12.490]  The music never stops
[03:06:12.490 --> 03:06:29.260]  The moon came up in white
