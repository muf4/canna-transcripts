[00:15.360 --> 00:17.920]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:17.920 --> 00:21.280]  It's time for episode number 241 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.560 --> 00:25.800]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:25.800 --> 00:27.800]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.840 --> 00:29.960]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.280]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[00:33.280 --> 00:37.000]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:37.640 --> 00:39.560]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.120]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:42.160 --> 00:44.920]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:44.920 --> 00:48.680]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:49.040 --> 00:51.520]  Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.400]  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting off the podcast with the throat thing
[00:58.400 --> 00:59.880]  already. I apologize.
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.160]  I'm going to blame it on all of the flower I've been smoking. That's right.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.920]  If you know me and if you listen to the podcast a lot,
[01:05.920 --> 01:09.720]  you know that I don't smoke a lot of flowers. Uh, we call weed, the buds,
[01:09.760 --> 01:11.680]  that's known as flowers in the cannabis industry.
[01:11.880 --> 01:14.080]  If you're in Colorado or a legal state, that's the flower.
[01:14.760 --> 01:17.120]  I don't smoke a lot of flower. I like to smoke a lot of concentrates.
[01:17.120 --> 01:18.280]  I like to take a lot of dabs,
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.640]  but last weekend I went to see fish and it's hard to sneak a dab rig into a
[01:22.640 --> 01:23.040]  concert,
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.400]  but you can sneak a whole bunch of joints and a whole bunch of weed into a
[01:25.400 --> 01:27.760]  concert. So I've been smoking a lot of flowers.
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.160]  It's been a little bit more convenient than taking a dab all the time,
[01:30.160 --> 01:32.200]  but you can hear what it's doing to my throat.
[01:33.840 --> 01:36.920]  I do apologize for that. Big shout out to this lemon OG Hayes.
[01:37.400 --> 01:41.680]  It was bred by the Ethos collective, Ethos seeds, Mr. Colin.
[01:41.840 --> 01:44.960]  And then, uh, I grew it at three rivers and then I bought it as a,
[01:45.320 --> 01:48.560]  just a patient over the counter. And I smoked a whole bunch of it this weekend.
[01:48.600 --> 01:51.800]  It was freaking delicious. Also smoked a bunch of the true cush.
[01:52.040 --> 01:55.120]  What else did I have? I had some Bordello and some blueberry headband.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.280]  They were all quite delicious.
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.440]  The Bordello was a little more mellow than what I would have preferred,
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.240]  but the flavor was on point. So once again,
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.680]  I apologize for all the throat clearing that you will hear during this episode.
[02:06.680 --> 02:09.720]  Hopefully it fades away. Once I start talking a lot, I'll get my voice going.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.760]  It will fade away. I've also got some water here.
[02:11.760 --> 02:13.600]  I've also got some frosty cold, Dr. Pepper.
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.080]  I will keep myself caffeinated and hydrated and I will deliver the best show I
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.720]  can bring you. All right.
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.040]  I've already been talking about seeing fish last weekend. Holy crap. You guys,
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.240]  if you know anything about me, you know,
[02:24.240 --> 02:26.080]  that fish is my favorite band on the planet.
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.600]  It was up for debate for a minute there.
[02:27.600 --> 02:30.280]  It might've been fish or the grateful dead for a moment.
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.040]  It may have been a band called Mo, but you know what? Fish is my favorite band.
[02:35.080 --> 02:38.480]  One thing I've noticed you guys is, uh, I don't, I don't know any of the new shit.
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.480]  I don't know half of the songs that fish plays anymore. I missed the old stuff.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.760]  I like the stuff when they wrote long,
[02:43.760 --> 02:46.080]  elaborate songs with a lot of great changes and now it's kind of
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.480]  straightforward, uh, four, four rock and roll stuff, which I'm not mad about.
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.840]  They had put in a lot of work to write all those other long songs,
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.400]  but a lot of the new stuff isn't for me. I still had a great time. Uh,
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.440]  fish did fish with the pH. I did three nights at a Dick's sporting goods.
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.880]  That's the Dick's sporting goods field or something like that. I don't know.
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.320]  It's a giant soccer field in Denver. It holds a lot of damn people.
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.520]  This place was huge and they did three nights in a row. They did Friday,
[03:13.520 --> 03:17.080]  Saturday and Sunday. Um, man, the concerts were great.
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.200]  I went with the always lovely, always beautiful Jenny Beth. We drove up to Denver.
[03:20.200 --> 03:22.960]  We got a hotel. We went and saw fish. Uh, the first night,
[03:22.960 --> 03:24.240]  my favorite song of the first night,
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.840]  I'm not going to read you the entire set list.
[03:26.040 --> 03:29.400]  One of my favorite fish songs of all time has always been tube.
[03:29.440 --> 03:31.560]  I've seen them play tube a couple of times live.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.760]  I got a really cool version of tube. Uh, the first night at the fish concert,
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.360]  that's always awesome. Of course, if you know me, you know that I love Harry hood.
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.720]  It's a reggae style fish song.
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.200]  They played Harry hood and then they played Harry hood into cavern cavern. Uh,
[03:45.240 --> 03:48.080]  the old stuff is my favorite. So of course I'm mentioning the old songs.
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.560]  Cavern is off of one of their first couple of albums that they put out off of a
[03:51.560 --> 03:54.440]  picture of nectar. Uh, it's the one with the quote, whatever you do,
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.480]  take care of your shoes. Uh, that was a great show. Super happy with that.
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.680]  They on-cord with the horse and a silent in the morning into character zero.
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.800]  Uh, I heard them play a little note. They do those little teaser notes.
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.000]  When a musician picks up his guitar and he's going to play a song,
[04:08.440 --> 04:11.160]  you put your pedals to your effects pedals are on the right thing.
[04:11.160 --> 04:12.920]  And then you do a little noodling to make sure it sounds right.
[04:12.920 --> 04:13.760]  And then you play the song.
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.960]  I can tell by their pre noodling what song it was going to be when it was the
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.240]  horse into silent in the morning. That's always fun.
[04:19.240 --> 04:21.000]  Call them the call the songs before they play them.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.320]  But the encore was the horse silent in the morning into character zero.
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.280]  That was the first night. That was pretty awesome. The second night,
[04:27.280 --> 04:30.000]  and I'm going to go quickly here with my favorites out of the set list. Uh,
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.240]  the people that are fish fans that listen to the show will appreciate it.
[04:32.240 --> 04:35.560]  The rest of you will just get to hear some of my favorite songs. Um,
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.240]  the second night they started the show with simple. I always thought that was cool.
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.680]  Then they went into a song that I I'm going to admit it.
[04:40.680 --> 04:42.280]  I don't know if I've ever fucking heard it before.
[04:42.280 --> 04:44.880]  It was called Martian monster. Don't know if I ever heard that.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.640]  That might've been my first time ever hearing that song. Like I said,
[04:47.640 --> 04:50.880]  I don't know any of the new fish stuff, anything after round room.
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.000]  I'm pretty lost. And before I don't even know a lot of round room.
[04:54.360 --> 04:57.040]  That's where they kind of lost me. I like, I love that old shit.
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.000]  I go to see the jams and the old shit and I go to see the buildup.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.240]  And then when trade hits that fucking pinnacle note,
[05:04.480 --> 05:06.760]  if you're a fish fan, you know what I mean? He just goes to this place.
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.600]  That's what I go for. I want to see that.
[05:08.880 --> 05:11.600]  So the second night they opened with simple and a Martian monster. Then,
[05:12.040 --> 05:14.480]  then they did it to me. Ladies and gentlemen, they played fucking Reba.
[05:15.280 --> 05:18.240]  The crowd went wild. Reba is a super popular fish song.
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.040]  They did it with the whistle. If you're wondering, it was awesome.
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.880]  Then they did sand a limb by limb in that set.
[05:24.360 --> 05:28.760]  Then a chalk dust. Okay. Here's where it got fun. Everything's right.
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.880]  Flago steam, chalk dust, torture, Mike song, winter queen. What's the use?
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.160]  We could put groove. All is one giant segue. Those all into each other. Uh,
[05:37.200 --> 05:38.840]  finished up with slave to the traffic light.
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.440]  Encore was the lizards and run like an antelope.
[05:41.480 --> 05:43.640]  I almost read you the whole set list, but damn,
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.400]  that second set was a fucking heater. You guys, that was fun.
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.320]  Lots of jamming went on there. Uh,
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.640]  the second night of the show actually sat with Mr. Sean as a Reedy and his
[05:52.680 --> 05:55.120]  lovely, uh, I don't, I'm not sure their official title,
[05:55.160 --> 05:58.640]  but his partner in crime is companion for the night. Miss Caroline. Uh,
[05:58.680 --> 06:01.680]  thanks for hanging out with us. That was a good time. And of course I had the
[06:01.680 --> 06:04.080]  lovely and beautiful miss Jenny Beth on my arm. Uh,
[06:04.080 --> 06:07.240]  we got some pretty cool seats. Uh, I don't buy the field seats. Uh,
[06:07.240 --> 06:09.400]  I don't get down on the field right in the front.
[06:09.400 --> 06:12.080]  It just gets a little too crowded. It's a little too much. Uh,
[06:12.080 --> 06:15.120]  a lot of people are all fucked up on drugs and they're not super polite.
[06:15.440 --> 06:16.480]  And it's not that they're rude.
[06:16.480 --> 06:18.760]  They're just fucking high out of their minds and they're not paying attention
[06:18.760 --> 06:21.240]  that they're in your space and spilling their drink on you and stepping on your
[06:21.280 --> 06:24.720]  toes. And I got a pretty girl with me and I don't need to deal with all that
[06:24.720 --> 06:28.440]  shit. So we, uh, we chose to sit in the stands and, uh,
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.280]  Sean happened to be about two rows back from the stands and he,
[06:32.280 --> 06:34.080]  him and Caroline saved us some seats.
[06:34.080 --> 06:36.680]  So we got to eat some vegan nachos in the parking lot.
[06:37.040 --> 06:39.840]  And then we headed into the fish show for the second night. That was great.
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.400]  The first night we just kind of floated around in the back, uh,
[06:42.400 --> 06:43.240]  in the back of Dick's,
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.600]  there's an area where you can just kind of stand there and dance.
[06:45.600 --> 06:47.600]  And there's not a lot of people around. It's not real crowded.
[06:47.600 --> 06:51.160]  I enjoyed that so I could get down and just shake my dreads and swing my arms
[06:51.160 --> 06:53.080]  around and be a silly hippie for a little while when you're six,
[06:53.080 --> 06:54.360]  five and your arms are super long.
[06:54.720 --> 06:56.640]  You just feel like you're always bumping into people at a concert.
[06:56.640 --> 06:58.560]  So it's kind of nice just to be in the back of the second night.
[06:58.880 --> 07:01.680]  We were kind of in the crowd and then three quarters of the way through the
[07:01.680 --> 07:03.760]  people to the right of me decided they'd had enough.
[07:04.200 --> 07:06.600]  They were a little older than myself and they just dipped out.
[07:06.600 --> 07:07.080]  They took off.
[07:07.080 --> 07:10.240]  So I had a lot of space to the right side of me and I stepped over and gave some
[07:10.240 --> 07:11.760]  other people some room, but that was pretty cool.
[07:11.760 --> 07:15.120]  So we'll keep going to the third night. They opened with a song.
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.360]  Not sure I'd ever heard Buffalo bill. I'm sure I've heard it somewhere.
[07:18.600 --> 07:20.880]  Didn't sound really familiar, but I knew the words. That was weird.
[07:21.200 --> 07:24.840]  The moment dance birds of a feather, a couple of things that I'm not familiar
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.800]  with back on the train, which is always cool. The wedge was fucking nice.
[07:29.200 --> 07:32.840]  46 days was not my thing. It sounded good. Not my favorite song.
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.000]  A bathtub gin was fucking awesome.
[07:36.520 --> 07:40.720]  Then set two down with disease. Then a couple other things. Meat stick,
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.080]  dude, the meat stick Piper into meat stick was pretty awesome.
[07:43.640 --> 07:48.160]  2001 possum Susie Greenberg. Jenny wanted to hear Susie Greenberg all weekend.
[07:48.160 --> 07:50.520]  She's like, I want to hear Susie Greenberg. I want to hear Susie Greenberg.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.480]  Fucking three songs left in the whole concert. She heard Susie Greenberg.
[07:53.480 --> 07:55.200]  So they wrap up the second set with Susie Greenberg,
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.040]  come out and do an encore of waste into first tube. So, uh,
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.760]  that was, Oh, and I kept mentioning to Jenny.
[08:02.760 --> 08:06.040]  I said they did not finish down with disease because there was more of down with
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.680]  disease that they didn't finish. There's a whole nother verse.
[08:08.960 --> 08:13.560]  And here I'm looking at the notes to the set list and it says on finished.
[08:14.280 --> 08:16.200]  So I didn't mention that the third night, uh,
[08:16.200 --> 08:19.480]  Jenny and I were kind of debating on where to sit because it's a huge venue and
[08:19.480 --> 08:22.080]  she kind of wanted to have a seat because she got pretty burnt out,
[08:22.080 --> 08:25.680]  tired over the weekend. And, uh, it's, it's just convenient to have a seat.
[08:26.160 --> 08:27.720]  And I was like, it was crowded.
[08:27.720 --> 08:29.280]  And I didn't really want to invade anybody's space.
[08:29.280 --> 08:32.280]  Cause it was a little later when we got in Sunday night and most of the good
[08:32.280 --> 08:35.840]  seats were taken and I was okay with just dancing like a hippie in the aisles and
[08:35.840 --> 08:37.520]  shows what I do. And especially at Dick's,
[08:37.520 --> 08:40.760]  they got that big whole ring area around there that you could just chill in. Uh,
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.920]  so I was like, how about we just go smoke a couple of joints off to the side?
[08:44.920 --> 08:47.600]  Cause there's some seats down by the stage that you can't really see the stage,
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.000]  but you can hear the music. It sounded fucking great. Uh,
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.440]  we smoked a joint during the opener during down with disease.
[08:52.440 --> 08:55.280]  And then we went up to the top and just walked around and started at the top
[08:55.280 --> 08:57.320]  and worked our way almost all the way around the bowl.
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.280]  And then just worked our way back.
[08:59.280 --> 09:01.840]  We went to one end and smoked the joint and went to the other end and smoked a
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.960]  joint. And we just walked around the whole third or the whole third night and
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.400]  just went and grabbed seats during the break or when we wanted to go sneak away
[09:09.400 --> 09:10.400]  and smoke a joint or something.
[09:10.400 --> 09:13.720]  So we just walked around mostly and that was kind of cool because we got to see
[09:13.720 --> 09:16.760]  a lot of different weirdos. The fish shows are filled with weirdos.
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.200]  And we also got to see the concert from a lot of different angles.
[09:19.480 --> 09:22.040]  And then I got to walk around and enjoy it the way I wanted to.
[09:22.040 --> 09:24.760]  And then Jenny also got to have a seat and rest her, her bones.
[09:24.760 --> 09:28.000]  Her knee was getting a little sore, which is understandable. But anyway,
[09:28.360 --> 09:30.640]  that was our seating arrangement on the third night.
[09:31.120 --> 09:33.080]  Uh, let's talk about some of my favorites, man.
[09:33.080 --> 09:36.480]  Some of my favorite songs over the weekend, of course, tube was awesome.
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.240]  Rebo was fucking amazing. A limb by limb was really cool.
[09:40.240 --> 09:43.440]  Contact is always one of my favorites. For some reason,
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.760]  the horse into silent in the morning is not particularly one of my favorite fish
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.400]  songs, but hearing it live the way that they did it was fucking great.
[09:51.400 --> 09:56.320]  They did a really good job. So good job. Fish had a great fucking weekend.
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.320]  Good job, Jenny Beth. Uh, thanks for being a great, uh, fish date, a weekend date.
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.600]  It's a fun little getaway with you. Had a great time. Uh, let's see.
[10:04.880 --> 10:08.280]  Also, I want to mention something. One night at the fish concert,
[10:08.280 --> 10:10.040]  I was in line getting some lemonade.
[10:10.040 --> 10:12.800]  It was probably the third night I would assume.
[10:13.240 --> 10:15.440]  I don't completely remember. Yeah. I think it was the third night.
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.880]  Cause we're way off to the left over there.
[10:16.880 --> 10:19.720]  Getting a lemonade had to be the third night cause that's where we kept smoking.
[10:19.720 --> 10:23.720]  Joints was in that one seat over there. Um, yeah, they didn't even,
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.640]  I just had so much,
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.400]  so many joints on me and they didn't even search me to find one of them.
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.760]  I had joints in every pocket. It was fucking awesome.
[10:29.760 --> 10:31.000]  It was rolling joints and filling them with,
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.120]  with wax and filling them with butter, with batters, with hashes.
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.360]  It was fucking awesome. But anyway, uh, the third night I was in line, uh,
[10:38.360 --> 10:41.880]  for a lemonade, the non-alcoholic lemonade that costs $6 and 50 cents.
[10:41.880 --> 10:44.800]  It's basically a cup of ice water. They drop a fucking lemon in it,
[10:44.840 --> 10:47.960]  charge you six 50, whatever. It was delicious. It was refreshing.
[10:47.960 --> 10:52.280]  But I met a lovely young lady who, uh,
[10:52.960 --> 10:56.200]  at first I wrote down Ashley and then I second guessed myself in her set and
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.280]  said, her name is Amber.
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.960]  I'm going to go with my first intuition and say that I met a lady named Ashley,
[11:02.120 --> 11:06.160]  but I don't want to be wrong. That feels fucking rude. So I apologize.
[11:06.240 --> 11:09.600]  I'm pretty sure it was Ashley or Amber. It was a fish concert by the way.
[11:09.600 --> 11:12.400]  And I did just get done smoking a gigantic joint.
[11:12.760 --> 11:15.160]  That's why I was getting lemonade. So I apologize if I got your name wrong,
[11:15.160 --> 11:19.320]  but she recognized me. Uh, she didn't recognize me. She's never seen me before.
[11:19.320 --> 11:24.200]  She, I was wearing an IRI genetics t-shirt and I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.920]  and I've talked about it on the podcast before.
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.520]  And I've talked about being at fish and she just turned around and she said,
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.080]  Hey, I don't mean to be weird, but are you Rasta Jeff from the podcast?
[11:33.080 --> 11:35.600]  And I was like, that's totally me. And she introduced herself.
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.040]  And obviously it was too fucking hot to pay proper attention. I did my best.
[11:39.040 --> 11:41.880]  I've got some ADD, uh, but she's from,
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.000]  she's from the East coast and she's trying to grow on the East coast.
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.920]  And she had some questions about how to mimic barometric pressure because she's
[11:49.920 --> 11:53.720]  struggling with pressure and moisture issues because everything is so different
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.800]  from growing out there to here. And her teacher has left her. Uh,
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.680]  she is not with her teacher anymore. Her teacher has moved to Colorado.
[12:00.680 --> 12:02.400]  So she's struggling to figure out some stuff.
[12:02.680 --> 12:05.640]  So if anybody's got any tips on how to mimic barometric pressure,
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.560]  I would love to hear about that. Cause I have no idea how to do that.
[12:09.040 --> 12:10.400]  But I had a great conversation with her.
[12:10.400 --> 12:13.160]  We hung out in line for a few minutes until it was her turn to order her drink.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.680]  And then my turn to order my drink. And then of course,
[12:14.680 --> 12:17.120]  miss Jenny Beth came from the, came back from using the restroom.
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.520]  So I got to introduce her also. Uh,
[12:19.760 --> 12:21.680]  it was funny cause we were standing in line trying to talk.
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.360]  And for some reason people decided that the space between her and I,
[12:25.440 --> 12:28.840]  between, uh, Ashley slash Amber slash my new friend,
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.840]  they decided that the space between us was the new walkway.
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.800]  And we were trying to talk politely and have a conversation and people just kept
[12:34.800 --> 12:37.040]  fucking passing through. Like we didn't exist. It was really funny.
[12:37.440 --> 12:39.880]  I found it entertaining, but she had some great questions.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.960]  And it was really great meeting somebody at a fish concert.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.480]  There were thousands of people there. I don't know how many,
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.960]  I'm going to say 10,000 people there.
[12:46.240 --> 12:49.760]  And this young lady recognized me and was polite enough to say hi.
[12:49.960 --> 12:52.160]  And I think that that's really cool. So that made my day.
[12:52.440 --> 12:56.280]  It was really fun getting a compliment and meeting a podcast listener randomly.
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.880]  I do. I apologize if I flubbed your name. I hope you understand.
[12:59.880 --> 13:00.920]  It was a fish concert.
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.280]  You know what would be really cool is if you sent me an email or contact me on
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.880]  social media and let me know if I got your name right or wrong or anywhere near
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.520]  what it actually is. I'm going to go with Ashley. Cause that's what I,
[13:10.520 --> 13:13.360]  what's what my brain said at first. Then I was like, no, you're wrong.
[13:13.360 --> 13:16.000]  And then I second guessed myself and said, Amber, but I'm going with Ashley.
[13:16.280 --> 13:20.200]  That's what I want to go with. Maybe. I don't know. All right, Amber, Ashley,
[13:20.240 --> 13:22.880]  let me know how close or how wrong I am. I want to hear about it.
[13:23.080 --> 13:25.800]  I also want to know about the gift I gave you. I gave you a gift.
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.120]  How's it going? How's it doing? Has it happened yet? I'm curious. Let me know.
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.320]  All right. So after the fish concert, the fish concert was great.
[13:33.320 --> 13:34.680]  After the fish concert Sunday,
[13:35.080 --> 13:38.960]  the lovely Jenny Beth and I headed back to the hotel and slept like fucking
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.800]  babies. We were worn out from a long fish weekend. We had a ton of fun.
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.000]  We were exhausted from running around in the sun and dancing all night.
[13:47.680 --> 13:49.000]  We woke up, we got cleaned up,
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.920]  packed up from the hotel and we headed to a restaurant known as Sam's number
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.240]  three delicious little fucking eat spot right there. That was tasty.
[13:57.960 --> 13:59.480]  It's marvelous. I would recommend that.
[14:00.120 --> 14:03.680]  We went and hung out at the guitar center in Denver for a few minutes there.
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.280]  The one on Colorado just went and beat around on some electronic drums for a few
[14:07.280 --> 14:09.520]  minutes. I just had some time to kill and we were right near that area.
[14:09.880 --> 14:13.600]  So I just went and knocked around on some drums and then we headed over to
[14:13.600 --> 14:17.440]  comedy works where I got dabbed the full code.
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.280]  I got super blazed and miss Jenny got super blazed as well.
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.680]  And we went to comedy works and we saw Mr. Doug Benson. That's right.
[14:24.680 --> 14:27.400]  Doug Benson was doing standup comedy. Most of the time when I go see Doug,
[14:27.680 --> 14:30.280]  he's doing his own podcast, which is called Doug loves movies,
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.640]  which is hilarious where he's usually got a few guests and they play some games
[14:33.640 --> 14:36.480]  on stage and people win prizes and things. And it's kind of interactive.
[14:36.880 --> 14:40.920]  It's a good time. This show, however, was just standup. Doug came out. Uh,
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.480]  it was kind of a weird setup. Honestly,
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.800]  they introduced Doug and he came out and did a little talking and then, uh,
[14:47.280 --> 14:49.640]  he went, he said, so I'm the host.
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.240]  So now I want to bring out my opening act Jacob Siroff and Jacob Siroff.
[14:53.240 --> 14:55.760]  I hope I'm saying that right. Sir off, sir off, sir off.
[14:56.160 --> 14:59.040]  Jacob Siroff came out and did like 35,
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.240]  45 solid minutes of fucking crushing material. You guys,
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.200]  if you want to be slightly offended, no matter who you are,
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.960]  no matter what race you are, what sexual orientation, what religion,
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.600]  Jacob Siroff has got something to offend you. And I like that kind of humor,
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.160]  honestly. So check him out. Jacob Siroff, S I R O F. Uh, check him out.
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.440]  He was hilarious. Uh, he's a little Jewish guy. He's kind of got, um, man,
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.360]  I don't want to contaminate your thought process when you see him or listen to
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.560]  him, but it's if, uh, if Ari Shafir and Mark Marin made a baby,
[15:31.600 --> 15:33.520]  it would be Jacob Siroff. That's kinda,
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.440]  that's kinda what I thought when I met him. Uh, so I went and saw Doug Benson.
[15:38.280 --> 15:40.640]  On the way to see Doug Benson,
[15:40.680 --> 15:43.640]  I decided to listen to the Doug loves minis podcast.
[15:44.240 --> 15:47.960]  A few minutes into the podcast, he's like Denver, I'm coming to see Denver or no,
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.160]  no. He actually read my iTunes review and Doug Benson said,
[15:52.280 --> 15:55.760]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me at the end of my iTunes review,
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.840]  because I was smart enough to type that in there.
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.800]  And he reads the iTunes reviews on his show.
[16:00.360 --> 16:03.200]  But then after he read my iTunes review, he's like Rasta Jeff,
[16:03.520 --> 16:05.560]  I'm going to Denver and I look forward to seeing Rasta Jeff.
[16:05.560 --> 16:07.880]  He comes to all the shows. So that'll be fun to see him there.
[16:08.120 --> 16:11.640]  He totally gave me like a long shout on his podcast. That was super cool.
[16:12.200 --> 16:16.720]  Then we were at comedy works at the show and Doug Benson reads tweets.
[16:16.880 --> 16:18.440]  If you tweet him before the show,
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.960]  he will read your tweet possibly during the opening part of the show.
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.320]  So he read my tweet. And of course I said, uh, at Doug Benson,
[16:28.520 --> 16:30.680]  I'm getting, I don't remember the words I used.
[16:30.680 --> 16:32.040]  I don't have my Twitter open right now,
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.320]  but I said I'm getting lit up on dabs and Dr. Pepper before the show.
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.040]  And he read, he asked me, he goes, Rasta Jeff's here. Where's Rasta Jeff?
[16:40.040 --> 16:42.320]  And I was like, Ooh, I'm right here. And he's like, what's up, dude?
[16:42.320 --> 16:43.640]  How many shows have you been to?
[16:43.640 --> 16:46.880]  And I couldn't think of how many Doug Benson shows I've actually been to.
[16:47.160 --> 16:50.840]  I said about 10, but honestly I said more than 10. Honestly,
[16:50.840 --> 16:54.800]  I think I've been to closer to 20 Doug Benson performances,
[16:55.160 --> 16:58.520]  all of which were at comedy works. So you read my tweet.
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.200]  He asked me some questions. He told me, thanks for coming. Uh,
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.480]  he said it was our 10th anniversary, which means the gift is paper.
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.000]  And then he said, I'm sure Rasta Jeff has something wrapped in paper.
[17:09.440 --> 17:10.400]  And then he laughed and he said,
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.120]  I look forward to seeing the outside dude because he met in the alley where we
[17:14.120 --> 17:16.760]  smoke. And then he goes, I'm going to give you a fucking, he can't believe.
[17:16.760 --> 17:18.680]  So Doug Benson told me he was going to give me a fucking,
[17:18.920 --> 17:20.440]  and then he just started laughing. And then he said, no,
[17:20.440 --> 17:22.920]  I'll see you out in the alley after your show. And then he said,
[17:22.920 --> 17:25.680]  me and all my friends are going to jump you and wash your hair,
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.480]  which was slightly offensive, but completely funny. And then, uh,
[17:29.520 --> 17:32.520]  of course, Miss Jenny Beth tweeted at Doug Benson also. So right after that,
[17:32.520 --> 17:33.680]  he said, where's miss?
[17:33.680 --> 17:35.880]  And I'm not going to say her Twitter handle cause I don't know if she wants it
[17:36.360 --> 17:38.560]  advertised like that. I'm going to be respectful. Sorry, babe.
[17:38.560 --> 17:41.240]  If you wanted me to say it, I'll say it on another show, but she did not,
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.120]  I don't know if she wants her. She didn't give me permission or anything.
[17:43.120 --> 17:46.480]  So he's Doug Benson's like, so where's this person? And she's like, Ooh,
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.080]  I'm right here. She was pretty embarrassed. And then he read her tweet,
[17:49.520 --> 17:52.440]  which was something about seeing Doug Benson after a great weekend. Thanks,
[17:52.440 --> 17:55.400]  babe. And she was saying, thanks, babe, to me. Cause she tagged me in the post,
[17:55.400 --> 17:57.480]  but Doug Benson was like, so is that for me, babe?
[17:57.480 --> 17:58.520]  And I thought it was pretty funny.
[17:58.920 --> 18:03.120]  So we both got our tweets read by Doug Benson during his recording.
[18:03.880 --> 18:08.640]  Doug Benson revealed that the show at comedy works was
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.080]  being recorded for his next comedy album that he will release on
[18:13.120 --> 18:13.960]  iTunes.
[18:14.320 --> 18:18.600]  So there is a good chance that myself and the always lovely, always beautiful,
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.440]  always charming miss Jenny Beth will be on Doug Benson's new recording
[18:23.440 --> 18:25.440]  because his new thing that he's doing, uh,
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.280]  he just records the entire show and then puts it out like a bootleg style,
[18:29.280 --> 18:33.120]  like how fish used to do. And the, it'll, the name of the show will be the date,
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.760]  which was, I believe September 4th, it'll be nine slash four slash 17,
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.880]  Denver, Colorado will be the name of the album.
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.440]  So I hope he puts it out because I mean,
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.840]  I got a lot of fucking interaction and it would be really cool to get to listen
[18:44.840 --> 18:49.080]  back to that. I had a good time. So the live album should come out.
[18:49.200 --> 18:51.480]  Hopefully that happens. I want to give a huge shout out.
[18:51.560 --> 18:53.120]  Even if the album doesn't come out,
[18:53.640 --> 18:55.480]  I always have a good time when Doug Benson comes.
[18:55.480 --> 18:56.920]  I want to give a huge shout out to Doug Benson.
[18:56.920 --> 19:01.320]  I don't think he listens to my podcast. I listened to three of his five podcasts.
[19:01.320 --> 19:05.120]  I think there's five. Let's see. Getting Doug with high Douglas movies,
[19:05.320 --> 19:07.560]  Douglas minis dining with Doug and Karen.
[19:07.560 --> 19:11.920]  And then there's the premium content, premium content on iTunes that I do not pay for.
[19:11.920 --> 19:12.760]  I apologize.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  Then there's also premium content on stitcher that I do not pay for.
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.080]  I may sound crazy, but there's so much fucking free podcasting.
[19:19.120 --> 19:21.880]  Why would I pay to listen to a podcast? Even though it's my buddy, Doug Benson,
[19:22.600 --> 19:23.560]  there's no need to pay for it.
[19:23.560 --> 19:26.560]  I couldn't listen to it if I did pay for it because there's so much goddamn
[19:26.560 --> 19:29.280]  content. Anyway, Joe Rogan's putting out fucking nine hours a week.
[19:29.680 --> 19:31.680]  I'm not going to pay for something, but anyway, uh,
[19:32.040 --> 19:34.760]  Doug Benson puts out a lot of content. I don't think he listens to my show.
[19:34.880 --> 19:37.640]  I listened to most of his, but anyway, huge shout out to Doug Benson.
[19:37.640 --> 19:40.880]  He always treats me just like a normal dude. We're buddies by now.
[19:40.880 --> 19:42.960]  He's like, what's up, dude. It's not even weird when he sees me,
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.240]  he interacts with me and just like we've hung out a lot. Also huge,
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.200]  huge shout out to Jacob Siroff. The dude was funny. Uh,
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.280]  he hung out with us after the show took pics with Jenny Beth and I smoked some
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.080]  joints with us. Also always,
[19:55.280 --> 19:58.080]  always want to give a huge shout out to my friends at comedy works in downtown
[19:58.080 --> 20:03.080]  Denver. Uh, shout out to the entire staff. Everybody there takes good care of me.
[20:03.080 --> 20:06.240]  I don't know a lot of their names because there are a lot of them and there's
[20:06.240 --> 20:08.120]  one of me. I know a few of their names,
[20:08.440 --> 20:10.880]  but everybody there takes great care of me.
[20:10.960 --> 20:15.000]  I appreciate it from the guy at the front bar to the guy at the second bar,
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.320]  to the ticket taker, to the guy that at the ticket booth,
[20:17.320 --> 20:21.200]  that gives you your tickets to all of the people that see you,
[20:21.200 --> 20:22.920]  that bring you drinks to the sound guy.
[20:22.920 --> 20:26.000]  Everybody there always treats me like fucking royalty, like a rockstar.
[20:26.040 --> 20:29.960]  I love that place. Can't show them enough love. If you're ever in Denver,
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.760]  go catch a comedy show at comedy works. Even if it's not a big name act,
[20:34.040 --> 20:37.080]  just go see some comedy. There are some rules when you see comedy guys.
[20:37.080 --> 20:40.880]  Let me educate you. Here's one rule. When you see comedy, shut the fuck up.
[20:40.920 --> 20:44.440]  You're not on stage. The only thing you're there to do is laugh your ass off.
[20:44.720 --> 20:47.840]  So don't interrupt. Don't interact. Shut the fuck up. Here's some jokes.
[20:48.160 --> 20:50.280]  Laugh. That's the only rules for comedy. Don't hack.
[20:50.280 --> 20:53.120]  Well don't be that guy. Comedy works. We'll kick you the fuck out. Honestly,
[20:53.440 --> 20:56.760]  if you heckle and interrupt and be a dick, comedy works will make you leave.
[20:57.680 --> 20:59.440]  All right, go see some comedy. I love comedy.
[20:59.600 --> 21:02.960]  And also I want to give a shout out to my friend Baker. Uh, Baker,
[21:02.960 --> 21:06.440]  you take good care of me, bro. I appreciate you. Also, since I'm at it,
[21:06.880 --> 21:10.160]  gigantic huge shout out to miss Jenny Beth for a great fish weekend.
[21:10.320 --> 21:15.120]  You're a perfect fish date. Perfect. Thank you. All right. Where are we?
[21:15.120 --> 21:19.040]  We're like 20 minutes into this and I haven't talked about cannabis at all.
[21:19.040 --> 21:20.520]  All I've talked about is smoking cannabis,
[21:20.520 --> 21:23.080]  but if you'll notice my throat has quit doing that thing.
[21:23.360 --> 21:25.480]  I'm gonna take a little drink right here and moisten myself up.
[21:31.670 --> 21:35.830]  Oh yeah. That was fucking deliciously refreshing. All right.
[21:36.510 --> 21:39.430]  I want to shift gears and talk about something a little bit more serious.
[21:40.470 --> 21:42.510]  I can't use any names because of, uh,
[21:42.630 --> 21:44.910]  I don't have permission and I try to be respectful,
[21:45.790 --> 21:49.990]  but I had something weird happen while I was at work the other day. One of my,
[21:50.150 --> 21:53.350]  I'm the boss and it sounds weird to say employees. One of my employees,
[21:53.750 --> 21:54.630]  I, that's how it goes.
[21:54.630 --> 21:58.070]  I just doesn't feel right cause he's my friend also and I don't like power trip
[21:58.070 --> 21:59.510]  and being the boss. He's equal to me.
[21:59.510 --> 22:03.270]  I've just got the title of I get the fucking to do list and spread it out and he
[22:03.270 --> 22:05.110]  does the shit. But anyhow,
[22:05.670 --> 22:10.670]  one of my employees applied pesticides and he assured me that he used all of the
[22:12.590 --> 22:16.390]  proper protective equipment and that he took all of the proper safety procedures
[22:16.390 --> 22:19.950]  and steps and that he followed the standard operation procedure to a T,
[22:19.990 --> 22:24.350]  which I know he does because he's a great employee. He's dedicated, he's smart,
[22:24.350 --> 22:26.630]  he's aware and he's just that guy.
[22:26.950 --> 22:29.190]  And he's also been worker protection safety trained.
[22:29.190 --> 22:32.550]  So I know what he's doing or I know that he knows what he's doing and he knows
[22:32.550 --> 22:34.790]  the risks involved with what he's doing.
[22:35.910 --> 22:40.230]  So my employee applied a pesticide to a room. He actually applied,
[22:41.070 --> 22:43.190]  you guys, you can mix pesticides if they're compatible.
[22:43.230 --> 22:44.790]  You don't have to spray one thing at a time.
[22:45.350 --> 22:50.350]  You can put like evergreen and maybe I don't want to tell you too many trade
[22:51.430 --> 22:51.790]  secrets,
[22:51.790 --> 22:54.910]  but you can put evergreen and cease in the same container and you can shake the
[22:54.910 --> 22:56.670]  shit out of them. Put them in there with water,
[22:57.230 --> 23:02.230]  uh, like 15 to 30 mils of evergreen and like 30 to 45 milliliters of cease and to
[23:04.030 --> 23:06.270]  spray that shit on your plants. It'll help you out. You can mix shit,
[23:06.550 --> 23:09.870]  but we do, we'll do multiple products at a time. Um,
[23:10.790 --> 23:13.710]  we've got a new product that we've only used a couple of times and this employee
[23:13.730 --> 23:18.350]  has never applied this product before. He did everything correctly. However,
[23:18.590 --> 23:23.590]  at some point he mentioned that he did get a couple of drops of this pesticide on
[23:24.470 --> 23:29.430]  his wrist area and he said he immediately removed his glove because it got past
[23:29.430 --> 23:32.950]  the glove. It got higher than the glove went. So he removed his glove.
[23:32.950 --> 23:36.190]  He went to the sink area and he washed his hand for a few minutes as directed.
[23:36.230 --> 23:39.470]  Then he went back and put on his gloves. He dried himself off, went back,
[23:39.470 --> 23:43.870]  put on his gloves and applied the pesticide as planned. Uh, he was okay.
[23:44.310 --> 23:48.230]  Later on that evening, his hand was turning a little bit red and it didn't
[23:48.230 --> 23:53.190]  bother him. Uh, he sprayed around 3 PM around 10 30 that night.
[23:53.190 --> 23:55.190]  He sent me a text message saying, Hey,
[23:55.190 --> 23:58.350]  I'm having an allergic reaction to that spray. Check this out.
[23:58.350 --> 24:02.510]  And he sent me a picture of his leg with welts growing on it. It looked,
[24:02.550 --> 24:06.710]  it looked like he had just welts all over his thigh area. It was bad.
[24:06.710 --> 24:10.830]  It was red and funky and it was a little concerning. So I was like, dude,
[24:11.030 --> 24:13.910]  we have to address this first thing in the morning. It was 10 30 at night.
[24:14.030 --> 24:16.710]  There was nothing I could do about it at the time other than tell him,
[24:16.950 --> 24:19.070]  go to the hospital if you feel that's what you need to do.
[24:19.350 --> 24:23.550]  Because as his friend and his boss and his coworker and someone that just cares
[24:23.550 --> 24:27.190]  about him in general, I was like, dude, if you need to go to the hospital, go,
[24:27.230 --> 24:30.750]  your job is safe. Like we're not mad at you. Go take care of you.
[24:30.750 --> 24:32.870]  Because that's what matters. So he's like, I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.
[24:32.870 --> 24:34.150]  It doesn't itch. I'll see you in the morning.
[24:35.070 --> 24:37.830]  He showed up the next morning at eight o'clock and I'm like,
[24:38.070 --> 24:39.670]  let me see that you're okay to work.
[24:39.710 --> 24:42.270]  Cause I don't need him there working if he's not in good shape.
[24:42.270 --> 24:45.870]  And I need him to go to the doctor so that we can prevent liabilities and get my
[24:45.870 --> 24:47.270]  friend safe again and healthy.
[24:47.750 --> 24:50.230]  So I make him pull up his shirt and show me like, cause he had,
[24:50.270 --> 24:52.310]  he said that it was on his rib cage last night. And I was like,
[24:52.310 --> 24:54.710]  let me see your ribs and his ribs are cool. I was like, let me see your thighs.
[24:54.710 --> 24:57.510]  Thighs were cool. Arms were cool. I was like, all right, I'll let you work, man.
[24:58.030 --> 25:00.430]  So we worked throughout the day. Everything was fine. Uh,
[25:00.430 --> 25:04.230]  everything was totally fine. We go to lunch at noon. We come back at one o'clock.
[25:04.350 --> 25:08.190]  He starts working around two o'clock. He approaches me and he said, Hey boss,
[25:08.190 --> 25:12.190]  look, it's coming back. He's got little welts on his arms that aren't significant,
[25:12.190 --> 25:14.670]  but you can see something's happening. Um,
[25:14.710 --> 25:17.430]  I said, we've got to keep an eye on this. If it gets any worse,
[25:17.430 --> 25:19.630]  you're going to the doctor. And he's like, shit,
[25:19.630 --> 25:23.030]  I don't want to go to the doctor, which is understandable. You guys,
[25:23.070 --> 25:26.230]  within probably 30 minutes of this conversation,
[25:26.430 --> 25:28.830]  he came back to me and he said, boss, I got to go to the hospital.
[25:29.430 --> 25:33.750]  This dude had welts on his rib cage area that looked like I had whipped this shit
[25:33.750 --> 25:35.270]  out of him with a whip for hours.
[25:35.590 --> 25:39.950]  These welts came out of nowhere and covered his rib cage area on both sides.
[25:40.230 --> 25:43.750]  He had welts on his thighs. He had welts on his forearms. His,
[25:44.150 --> 25:46.310]  he's Brown. His skin is Brown. I'm not being racist.
[25:46.310 --> 25:48.710]  He's got a very Brown complexion. He's a Brown person.
[25:48.710 --> 25:53.110]  He's got black hair, fucking Brown skin. Uh, he was red.
[25:53.310 --> 25:57.190]  His skin was visibly red. You could see that his face was red. And I was like,
[25:57.190 --> 25:58.430]  bro, we got to take you to the hospital.
[25:58.430 --> 26:03.430]  So I grabbed all of the labels off of all of the bottles that he had
[26:03.430 --> 26:05.150]  used and put them in a baggie.
[26:05.590 --> 26:08.070]  And we drove to the hospital with those labels.
[26:09.070 --> 26:13.830]  And we had to tell the hospital that my friend had been exposed to pesticides.
[26:13.830 --> 26:15.950]  Now it was really funny because they're like, what are you here for?
[26:15.950 --> 26:17.270]  And I was like, pesticide exposure.
[26:17.830 --> 26:19.750]  Their instant reaction was to freak out.
[26:19.870 --> 26:21.390]  They were like, did you bring it in here?
[26:21.510 --> 26:24.070]  How long ago did you change clothes? Are you wearing the same clothes?
[26:24.070 --> 26:27.670]  Did you shower? And I was like, my buddy was kind of before that,
[26:27.950 --> 26:30.910]  when they're checking in, they asked him, they asked him like height, weight,
[26:30.910 --> 26:35.830]  birthday, address, name, phone number. And then they said, do you feel safe at home?
[26:36.550 --> 26:39.390]  And he goes, what the fuck? And the nurse laughed. She goes,
[26:39.390 --> 26:41.470]  do you feel safe at home? And he goes, yeah.
[26:41.710 --> 26:45.830]  And she explained that they have to ask that because that may be some person's
[26:45.830 --> 26:48.030]  only opportunity to say no.
[26:48.390 --> 26:51.030]  So don't ever laugh at them when they ask you that fucking question,
[26:51.030 --> 26:54.830]  because there may be one person that says, no, I need some fucking help.
[26:54.830 --> 26:58.190]  It's scary at home. Someone's doing shit to me. So that's what that's for.
[26:58.190 --> 27:01.030]  Don't laugh. But my buddy was thrown off by that question.
[27:01.030 --> 27:03.670]  So I had to kind of interrupt and explain. I was like, dude,
[27:03.950 --> 27:06.830]  this happened yesterday at three 20. My friend went home.
[27:06.950 --> 27:09.270]  He changed clothes immediately. Uh,
[27:09.270 --> 27:13.190]  he's taken two or three showers since then he came to work and worked all day
[27:13.470 --> 27:15.070]  and hasn't been near that pesticide.
[27:15.070 --> 27:17.350]  I was off on the day that the application happened.
[27:17.350 --> 27:20.110]  I haven't been near the pesticide or the applied room at all.
[27:20.470 --> 27:21.950]  I was like, all this shit happened yesterday.
[27:22.270 --> 27:25.510]  And they all took a big breath and calm down. They're like, ah,
[27:25.550 --> 27:28.150]  we're about to put you guys in the decontamination shower.
[27:28.310 --> 27:30.950]  So me and my buddy were about to get a shower together. It sounded like,
[27:30.950 --> 27:32.310]  which would have been super awkward.
[27:32.630 --> 27:34.630]  We were going to get thrown to the decontamination unit,
[27:34.630 --> 27:37.070]  which was it had been really a longer story than this.
[27:37.070 --> 27:39.790]  It would have been a lot more expensive of a bill than what it was.
[27:40.190 --> 27:43.510]  Luckily I was able to speak up and tell him that wasn't necessary. Uh,
[27:43.550 --> 27:47.670]  so they ended up telling my friend that it was certainly an allergic reaction to
[27:47.670 --> 27:51.070]  the pesticide. They're like, and my friend kept saying,
[27:51.070 --> 27:53.350]  but I didn't get it on my legs. And they explained,
[27:53.390 --> 27:56.550]  you don't have to get it on your legs. The stuff you got on you,
[27:56.910 --> 27:59.430]  your body is allergic to it. You had a reaction.
[27:59.670 --> 28:02.710]  It's trying to move that reaction around your body to deal with it.
[28:02.710 --> 28:07.030]  So he got these weird hives all over himself, these welts,
[28:07.030 --> 28:09.070]  these hive looking things all over his body.
[28:09.750 --> 28:12.870]  They told him to take a couple of Benadryl and take Benadryl every time it
[28:12.870 --> 28:15.390]  started flaring up. And he said it was starting to itch real bad.
[28:15.390 --> 28:17.750]  You could see him trying not to scratch it. Uh,
[28:17.790 --> 28:20.750]  and they also gave him a steroid shot and the stare said the steroid shot would
[28:20.750 --> 28:22.990]  speed it up and help his body heal and recover from it.
[28:23.710 --> 28:28.230]  So I gave him the next day off. He's got, uh, three days off in a row right now.
[28:28.630 --> 28:30.310]  I called him today. It's been,
[28:30.350 --> 28:33.070]  he had a full day without me bugging him that I called him today.
[28:33.470 --> 28:34.950]  And he said that he feels just fine,
[28:34.950 --> 28:37.830]  that it flares up occasionally and it itches when he does,
[28:37.830 --> 28:42.230]  but he takes a Benadryl and it goes away. So he's doing much better.
[28:42.910 --> 28:44.670]  So by now I'm sure a lot of people are going,
[28:44.670 --> 28:47.750]  why is Jeff telling us about his friend fucking up with the pesticide?
[28:49.270 --> 28:54.190]  I'm telling you this because my friend got drops of a pesticide on himself.
[28:54.510 --> 28:55.710]  Just a few drops.
[28:55.830 --> 28:59.430]  You can see where the drops landed on his skin and left little marks.
[28:59.430 --> 29:02.910]  You can see how much you can actually see how much shit landed on him.
[29:02.910 --> 29:05.910]  Cause it gave him a tattoo. It changed his skin color right there.
[29:05.910 --> 29:06.750]  It's back now,
[29:06.790 --> 29:10.950]  but it temporarily changed his skin color and it messed up his whole body.
[29:11.470 --> 29:14.510]  I gave him a fever. Uh, it made him itchy.
[29:15.110 --> 29:18.230]  It gave him welts and these weird bumps all over himself,
[29:18.230 --> 29:20.430]  these hive like bumps. And he wanted to scratch them.
[29:20.430 --> 29:22.070]  And I feel that if he would have scratched them,
[29:22.070 --> 29:24.350]  he would have ripped something open and he would have been bleeding and gotten
[29:24.350 --> 29:26.430]  himself infected just by how bad they looked.
[29:27.230 --> 29:30.230]  The reason I'm telling you guys this is because I want you to be more careful
[29:30.230 --> 29:33.110]  when applying pesticides. A lot of us, myself included,
[29:33.230 --> 29:34.430]  we've talked about this at the grow.
[29:34.430 --> 29:38.710]  We've all gotten everybody that grows that's been doing this for a long time is
[29:38.710 --> 29:42.630]  all gotten a little, a little lackadaisical, maybe the word. Uh,
[29:42.670 --> 29:46.870]  we are a little complacent when it comes to applying pesticides and or being
[29:46.870 --> 29:47.950]  around pesticides.
[29:48.230 --> 29:51.870]  I know I did a podcast a while back about pesticide safety and pesticide
[29:51.870 --> 29:55.790]  training. We've all had that training at my grow several times,
[29:55.790 --> 29:59.670]  and something still happened. So I want you guys to be careful.
[30:00.350 --> 30:03.670]  Now the next thing I want you to do is think about what you're going to do.
[30:03.950 --> 30:05.910]  If you do have a pesticide problem,
[30:06.150 --> 30:08.790]  if you're exposed to something and you've got an emergency,
[30:09.030 --> 30:12.910]  what are you going to do to help yourself? Is there somebody you can call?
[30:13.270 --> 30:17.190]  Is there somebody at home with you? Are you fucked? Do you have an illegal grow?
[30:17.870 --> 30:21.590]  If you're running an illegal grow and you apply a pesticide and let's,
[30:21.870 --> 30:23.510]  I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
[30:23.550 --> 30:26.350]  I didn't want anything bad to happen to my coworker. I may have said his name,
[30:26.350 --> 30:28.830]  so I have to fucking listen back to this whole thing and make sure I didn't say
[30:28.830 --> 30:32.350]  anything, say my buddy's name. Um, I didn't want anything to happen to him,
[30:32.350 --> 30:33.190]  but it did.
[30:33.870 --> 30:37.870]  And luckily I have a support team that I can reach out to and say, Hey,
[30:38.110 --> 30:39.950]  bad shit happened. I need guidance.
[30:40.310 --> 30:44.950]  They gave me step-by-step instruction on how to handle this for my coworker
[30:44.950 --> 30:49.190]  safety, for my safety and for the company safety. You may not have that.
[30:49.510 --> 30:51.670]  So think about what you're going to do.
[30:52.430 --> 30:55.550]  Let's just say you're spraying, you got your pump sprayer.
[30:55.590 --> 30:58.670]  However you apply your pesticide. It's probably in some sort of a pump sprayer.
[30:58.910 --> 31:03.110]  You're pumping it. Something ruptures that fucker explodes and pesticide goes,
[31:03.630 --> 31:05.830]  I don't want it in your eye. Let's not even go that extreme.
[31:05.910 --> 31:09.230]  You just get pesticide up the side of your face. You got it on your cheek.
[31:09.470 --> 31:12.390]  It's kind of dripping down your neck. It's enough to make you go off. Fuck.
[31:12.670 --> 31:16.150]  I just got a bunch of evergreen on my neck. What are you going to do?
[31:16.190 --> 31:18.470]  Do you have a plan? Are you going to freak out?
[31:18.990 --> 31:22.070]  If you've got an illegal grow and you've got to go to the hospital for this,
[31:22.310 --> 31:26.070]  you need a reason to be spraying evergreen.
[31:26.070 --> 31:29.830]  You can't do a spray under my weed plants. So think about all this stuff.
[31:30.550 --> 31:34.630]  Have the number for poison control handy. It's a regional number.
[31:35.230 --> 31:37.390]  I think I don't want to give you the wrong number.
[31:37.630 --> 31:41.110]  Just Google poison control on your phone and you will have the right number.
[31:41.110 --> 31:43.550]  There's one number you can call and they transfer you to the correct region is
[31:43.550 --> 31:47.350]  actually what happens. So have the poison control phone number on your phone.
[31:48.270 --> 31:50.110]  If you've got an advanced phone,
[31:50.150 --> 31:54.070]  you can talk into it and you can say call poison control. So if you need help,
[31:54.590 --> 31:57.310]  your phone Siri will call poison control for you.
[31:57.470 --> 32:01.630]  They can give you advice on what to do. Don't be afraid to call nine one one.
[32:01.710 --> 32:04.510]  If you've got pesticides in your eyes, you're going to need help.
[32:04.630 --> 32:08.270]  You're going to have to call nine one one. Where are some goggles when you're,
[32:08.590 --> 32:09.950]  as soon as you pick that bottle up,
[32:09.950 --> 32:14.110]  be sure to have goggles on because maybe the lid's not put on and you go to
[32:14.110 --> 32:16.910]  shake it and that shit flies in your eye. You haven't even applied it yet.
[32:16.910 --> 32:19.910]  You haven't poured it yet. You've already fucked up. You needed goggles.
[32:19.910 --> 32:21.470]  Then get the goggles early.
[32:22.470 --> 32:25.070]  So know what you're going to do. If you do have a problem,
[32:25.390 --> 32:29.670]  you need most pesticides. I can't speak for every pesticide.
[32:29.790 --> 32:31.910]  Most of them. If you get it on your skin,
[32:32.190 --> 32:37.110]  the thing you need to do is rinse for 15 minutes. Wouldn't be a problem.
[32:37.150 --> 32:40.950]  Just rinse that area for 15 minutes. If you've got some antibacterial soap,
[32:41.110 --> 32:44.710]  scrub that shit on there, get that pesticide off of your skin.
[32:44.990 --> 32:49.030]  It's better to rinse too much and wash too heavily than just to be lazy and
[32:49.030 --> 32:51.910]  leave some on there. So get in there and rinse that shit off.
[32:52.270 --> 32:57.270]  If you see anything like a welt or anything like your skin raising or turning
[32:57.670 --> 32:59.110]  white or changing colors,
[33:00.470 --> 33:02.990]  maybe consider going to the hospital and getting looked at.
[33:03.030 --> 33:06.790]  It's going to be expensive, but your health is priceless. Okay?
[33:07.030 --> 33:10.550]  Luckily my coworker was able to take some Benadryls and get a shot.
[33:10.590 --> 33:12.190]  He didn't have anything too serious.
[33:13.070 --> 33:16.030]  Please don't put yourself in my coworker's position.
[33:16.710 --> 33:19.670]  I know I've been ranting about this for a long time, but it was scary.
[33:20.030 --> 33:24.270]  My buddy was already fucked up from pesticides and then I was watching him just
[33:24.270 --> 33:27.270]  have a fucking nervous breakdown because he was so scared of what he may have
[33:27.270 --> 33:29.710]  done to his body and what may happen to him at the hospital.
[33:30.070 --> 33:33.830]  It was not a fun experience for anybody and it was quite expensive. Luckily,
[33:34.190 --> 33:35.830]  it'll be covered because we have a great company.
[33:35.830 --> 33:37.510]  Workman's comp handles that sort of shit.
[33:37.910 --> 33:40.990]  But if that was you at home and you had to pay for it out of pocket or through
[33:40.990 --> 33:44.070]  your insurance, you're going to have some splaining to do and it's going to get
[33:44.070 --> 33:47.750]  expensive. So I'm going to say it again. Have a plan.
[33:47.790 --> 33:51.510]  If you fuck up with pesticides, have a plan, know what you're going to do.
[33:51.830 --> 33:54.590]  You need to clean yourself. You need to get the clothes off of you.
[33:54.590 --> 33:56.590]  If it's on your clothes, you need to shower.
[33:56.790 --> 34:00.230]  If you feel like you need medical attention, don't be shy. Go get it. Okay?
[34:00.630 --> 34:03.470]  It's always best to have somebody around when you're applying pesticides.
[34:03.950 --> 34:07.550]  Always use the proper equipment, goggles all the time.
[34:07.550 --> 34:10.110]  From the minute you pick up that pest, put the goggles on,
[34:10.150 --> 34:14.950]  then pick up the pesticide bottle, have gloves on at least those six mil,
[34:15.470 --> 34:18.990]  a six millimeter thick nitrile gloves, at least wear those.
[34:19.390 --> 34:21.790]  You're supposed to wear something 12 milliliter,
[34:22.270 --> 34:25.670]  12 millimeters thick when you're handling a pesticide.
[34:25.670 --> 34:29.430]  A lot of the pesticides need something thicker. Wear those thicker gloves,
[34:29.750 --> 34:34.510]  wear long sleeves, wear pants, definitely cover your fucking feet.
[34:34.950 --> 34:36.350]  Make sure that your feet are covered.
[34:36.350 --> 34:38.910]  All the pesticides going to fall to the ground and you're going to walk in it.
[34:38.910 --> 34:42.590]  The bottoms of your feet are some of the most absorb, absorb.
[34:43.350 --> 34:46.590]  I don't know the proper word. The bottoms of your feet absorb a lot. Uh,
[34:46.590 --> 34:50.350]  they're able to, it's the most absorption knee. I don't fucking know.
[34:50.350 --> 34:54.150]  Pick a word right there. Uh, it absorbs the most, the bottom of your feet,
[34:54.150 --> 34:56.630]  your genitals, your eyes and your mouth, your palms.
[34:56.790 --> 34:58.350]  That's where you can absorb a lot of stuff.
[34:58.550 --> 35:01.430]  So don't go walking around in pesticides, cover up your feet.
[35:01.430 --> 35:04.350]  If you're applying pesticides, always, always,
[35:04.350 --> 35:09.150]  always follow the re-entry interval rules on the bottle.
[35:09.230 --> 35:12.630]  It's on every bottle. Also, here's something to think about.
[35:12.830 --> 35:13.870]  If you've got a home grow,
[35:13.870 --> 35:17.590]  if you've got an indoor grow and you don't have major air circulation,
[35:18.110 --> 35:21.470]  you need to give extra time for what's called a ventilation period.
[35:21.470 --> 35:25.510]  When you apply a pesticide in a room, it becomes basically a vapor.
[35:25.510 --> 35:27.350]  If you're using a paint sprayer or a pump sprayer,
[35:27.350 --> 35:29.790]  you've turned it into little vapors and it's floating around the room.
[35:30.150 --> 35:34.630]  You have to allow two hours for a ventilation period for that vapor to dissipate
[35:34.670 --> 35:37.830]  and become to land. Essentially it needs to land.
[35:37.830 --> 35:39.550]  That fog in the room needs to go away.
[35:39.790 --> 35:43.150]  So you've got a two hour ventilation period before your re-entry interval
[35:43.150 --> 35:47.070]  starts. So a lot of the products we're using have a four and eight, a 12.
[35:47.350 --> 35:51.790]  None of them should have a 24 hour re-entry re-entry interval. Uh, if you,
[35:51.910 --> 35:54.310]  if it does, you're using some major shit. You may want to reconsider that,
[35:54.670 --> 35:59.670]  but follow those rules carefully and where your personal protective equipment.
[36:00.390 --> 36:03.390]  If you have to go in there early, please take it seriously. You guys,
[36:03.750 --> 36:08.670]  I've seen very minor effects of things going wrong with pesticides and it was a
[36:08.670 --> 36:12.110]  scary situation. I don't want it to happen to anybody.
[36:12.670 --> 36:15.750]  I don't want it to happen to you. I want you to be safe.
[36:16.550 --> 36:19.270]  One thing I would recommend is before you apply a pesticide,
[36:19.470 --> 36:23.750]  read what to do should you fuck up so that you don't have to be struggling,
[36:24.030 --> 36:25.790]  panicking, having a freak out,
[36:25.830 --> 36:29.070]  possibly have shit in your eyes and then trying to read a bottle to figure out
[36:29.070 --> 36:33.270]  what to do. Read it before. Also, should you need to go to the hospital?
[36:33.310 --> 36:35.630]  I don't want you to have to, but you may have to, you guys, this,
[36:35.670 --> 36:38.190]  this shit comes up. I had to take a good friend to the hospital.
[36:38.470 --> 36:42.310]  If you have to go to the hospital, take the labels off of the bottles.
[36:42.870 --> 36:45.710]  Don't take them too far into the hospital before you tell somebody what you've
[36:45.710 --> 36:48.150]  got, because they're going to want to put it in a safe container.
[36:48.150 --> 36:52.590]  So you don't spread any of that pesticide around the hospital. If you can,
[36:54.030 --> 36:57.430]  if time allows, take a shower and change your clothes,
[36:57.630 --> 37:00.630]  anything you were wearing when you applied pesticides, take it off,
[37:00.950 --> 37:02.110]  rinse your body thoroughly,
[37:02.350 --> 37:04.870]  put on fresh clothes that aren't contaminated with pesticides,
[37:05.150 --> 37:05.990]  then go to the hospital.
[37:05.990 --> 37:08.750]  So that way you don't contaminate the hospital with pesticides.
[37:08.750 --> 37:11.910]  Also you don't contaminate the people that help you, the doctor, the nurse,
[37:11.910 --> 37:14.070]  the triage nurse, the lady at check-in,
[37:14.070 --> 37:15.670]  the security guard that takes your knife from you.
[37:16.310 --> 37:20.190]  Just don't contaminate them with pesticides. Also pay attention to pesticides.
[37:21.070 --> 37:25.390]  I encourage everybody to read all of the labeling on all of the pesticides you
[37:25.390 --> 37:26.150]  were using.
[37:26.150 --> 37:29.390]  I encourage you to use all of the proper equipment that you need for all of
[37:29.410 --> 37:31.710]  those pesticides. Do not take any of it lightly.
[37:32.670 --> 37:36.150]  And please be careful with the pesticides you're using outdoors.
[37:36.150 --> 37:39.270]  Do not fuck up our environment so that you can grow some cannabis. All right?
[37:39.270 --> 37:42.350]  It's not worth it. That all of the land is not yours.
[37:42.350 --> 37:45.310]  Just that one plot that you're growing on and that spray that you're spraying is
[37:45.310 --> 37:47.950]  affecting the entire world. And it's not fair.
[37:47.950 --> 37:50.470]  So please be respectful if you're spraying pesticides outside,
[37:50.790 --> 37:53.310]  no matter what you're doing with this pesticide, please be careful.
[37:53.510 --> 37:56.750]  Please respect the shit in that bottle. It's not a joke. All right.
[37:56.750 --> 37:59.470]  I feel like I've been fucking giving you guys a lecture for a long time.
[37:59.750 --> 38:03.590]  I'm going to stop doing that for right now. All right. Podcast world.
[38:03.590 --> 38:06.630]  I've been going for close to 40 minutes. I did have a couple of emails.
[38:06.630 --> 38:09.430]  I've got two emails about the same topic.
[38:09.430 --> 38:12.350]  They're both about getting into the cannabis industry and folks moving to
[38:12.350 --> 38:15.830]  Colorado. We got one person coming from Georgia.
[38:16.190 --> 38:18.070]  We got another person coming from Florida.
[38:18.510 --> 38:21.470]  I actually hope they are both okay since we've got a fucking tremendous
[38:21.470 --> 38:24.150]  hurricane down there, whipping everybody's ass. You guys, I hope you're well.
[38:24.150 --> 38:25.550]  I hope you're able to listen to this podcast.
[38:25.550 --> 38:26.910]  I hope you and your families are safe.
[38:27.270 --> 38:30.230]  I actually hope everybody down in the South is safe.
[38:30.230 --> 38:32.790]  I hope everybody in the West is safe from the fires.
[38:32.790 --> 38:37.430]  Everyone in the South is safe from the floods that I send fucking love and light
[38:37.430 --> 38:39.790]  to everybody in times of struggles right now,
[38:39.790 --> 38:43.070]  because the natural disasters or whatever type of disaster you've got in your
[38:43.070 --> 38:44.670]  life, I fucking send you some jaw love.
[38:45.510 --> 38:48.790]  But what I was saying was I'm going to read some emails on the next episode,
[38:48.950 --> 38:51.310]  uh, from folks from down South,
[38:51.630 --> 38:55.310]  they're both coming to Colorado or looking to come to Colorado to get into the
[38:55.310 --> 38:58.590]  industry. So we'll talk about how to guide them into doing that a little bit.
[38:58.990 --> 39:01.390]  Uh, if you'd like to send me an email to read on a future episode,
[39:01.590 --> 39:05.430]  I would love to hear from you. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[39:05.430 --> 39:07.550]  Also, if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[39:07.990 --> 39:09.750]  or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[39:09.950 --> 39:13.390]  you can contact me through grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[39:13.950 --> 39:18.470]  Speaking of product reviews, I do have a box from my friends at PL grow.
[39:18.470 --> 39:20.910]  They sent me a great product to try out. Uh,
[39:20.910 --> 39:22.950]  I have been away on vacation seeing fish.
[39:23.190 --> 39:27.190]  I came back from seeing fish to find out that my coworker had a pesticide
[39:27.190 --> 39:30.590]  problem. And then today I'm recording, hopefully over the weekend,
[39:30.590 --> 39:32.950]  I am able to set up the device that they sent me.
[39:33.390 --> 39:34.830]  I'll play around with that over the weekend.
[39:34.830 --> 39:37.470]  I'll get it set up and running for the week. And then hopefully, uh,
[39:37.510 --> 39:38.590]  within the next few weeks,
[39:38.590 --> 39:41.950]  I'll be able to give you guys a full report and a full review,
[39:41.990 --> 39:44.950]  and I'll be able to report back to my friends at PL grow.
[39:45.150 --> 39:49.150]  I'm sure they're looking forward to all of my words. All right,
[39:49.150 --> 39:51.470]  you guys can tell my voice is starting to burn out. Uh,
[39:51.590 --> 39:54.590]  I would appreciate it. If you find me on all of this social media,

[40:16.750 --> 40:20.470]  pictures of plants from my personal grow. Lots of great photos. In my opinion,

[40:49.630 --> 40:51.870]  That helps me cover the cost of my website every year.
[40:51.870 --> 40:54.870]  It helps me buy new little covers for the microphone so that when Mike comes
[40:54.870 --> 40:57.870]  over, he doesn't have to spit into the same microphone cover that granny was
[40:57.890 --> 41:00.310]  using. We get to switch it up, keep everybody healthy.

[41:07.710 --> 41:10.630]  I hope you guys are enjoying the throwback Thursday episodes that I'm making.
[41:10.910 --> 41:14.830]  Uh, almost every Thursday I put out a long block of old episodes.
[41:15.150 --> 41:17.830]  My reason for doing so is because on iTunes and snitcher,
[41:17.830 --> 41:20.470]  those feeds only hold 100 episodes.
[41:20.910 --> 41:25.150]  That means that the most recent 100 shows are there and all the old shit falls
[41:25.150 --> 41:25.950]  right out of the feed.
[41:25.950 --> 41:29.710]  So I've been making long blocks of episodes to make those good episodes
[41:29.710 --> 41:32.950]  available once again. So new listeners can go back and hear old content.
[41:33.350 --> 41:35.110]  Once they get caught up, I'll stop doing it.
[41:35.350 --> 41:39.030]  The good part is I'm putting old episodes up on YouTube.
[41:39.070 --> 41:41.310]  YouTube will not limit how many shows I've got.
[41:41.590 --> 41:44.750]  So if you check out YouTube search for the grow from your heart podcast,
[41:45.390 --> 41:46.230]  you will find,
[41:46.550 --> 41:50.590]  I think there are approximately 75 to 80 videos up on YouTube.
[41:50.590 --> 41:52.110]  Now I do plan on making more.
[41:52.470 --> 41:55.270]  It just is time consuming and I'm a hardworking young man.
[41:55.950 --> 41:58.070]  So I don't have a lot of time to sit here and make YouTube videos,
[41:58.090 --> 42:01.910]  but I'll get them up so that you can enjoy them. Ladies and gentlemen,
[42:02.030 --> 42:04.390]  I think you can hear my voice cutting out and it's starting to go.
[42:04.390 --> 42:07.910]  So it is time to wrap up this podcast. I want to give a huge shout out to big,
[42:07.910 --> 42:10.270]  John. I got your email and I appreciate it.
[42:10.950 --> 42:14.070]  And I also want to give a huge shout out to everybody who is volunteering time
[42:14.090 --> 42:18.190]  to go rescue people from floods, volunteering to go put out fires.
[42:18.470 --> 42:22.390]  I appreciate you guys also. We need more people like you. And until next time,
[42:22.630 --> 42:24.870]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug.
[47:38.530 --> 47:40.370]  I know
[47:45.810 --> 47:46.650]  the ultimate
[47:50.170 --> 47:51.010]  society.
[47:56.010 --> 47:56.370]  God,

[47:57.210 --> 47:58.050]  God,

[48:13.210 --> 48:16.130]  rasta Jeff, let's not drag my mom into this
[48:18.450 --> 48:22.650]  and I'll see you soon. I assume I ass
