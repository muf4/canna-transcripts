[00:01.530 --> 00:23.870]  It's time for episode number 176 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.870 --> 00:25.870]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.870 --> 00:26.870]  That's right.
[00:26.870 --> 00:30.750]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:30.750 --> 00:34.390]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:34.390 --> 00:39.230]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.230 --> 00:40.230]  I'm your host, my friends.
[00:40.230 --> 00:41.230]  Call me Rasta Jeff on it.
[00:41.230 --> 00:42.790]  Thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.790 --> 00:45.790]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:45.790 --> 00:48.270]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.270 --> 00:51.830]  Big shout to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.830 --> 00:55.270]  Oh guys, I apologize for the clogged up throat there.
[00:55.270 --> 00:58.630]  I'm going to blame that one on everybody here at the table.
[00:58.630 --> 01:01.870]  There is a newcomer to the podcast sitting in front of me is my new friend, Shannon.
[01:01.870 --> 01:02.870]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:02.870 --> 01:03.870]  Thank you.
[01:03.870 --> 01:04.870]  Thank you for having me.
[01:04.870 --> 01:06.310]  Oh, thank you for bringing the dabbing granny.
[01:06.310 --> 01:07.310]  The dabbing granny is here.
[01:07.310 --> 01:08.310]  Yes.
[01:08.310 --> 01:09.310]  She drove me down.
[01:09.390 --> 01:13.350]  I'm trying to clear my throat and get this podcast started, but oh my gosh, when granny
[01:13.350 --> 01:15.030]  shows up, we take some dabs.
[01:15.030 --> 01:17.030]  What happens when you come here?
[01:17.030 --> 01:19.030]  We get high as fuck.
[01:19.030 --> 01:20.030]  Yes, we do.
[01:20.030 --> 01:23.110]  Shout also shout out to the Barefoot Grower for helping us out to get high as fuck.
[01:23.110 --> 01:24.110]  Yes, I met him for the first time.
[01:24.110 --> 01:28.070]  He had to run before the show started, but thanks for dropping by tonight, bro.
[01:28.070 --> 01:30.110]  Also repeat offenders are here.
[01:30.110 --> 01:35.230]  She tried to mimic the whole entire intro, but she couldn't quite do it.
[01:35.230 --> 01:38.310]  She's recovered from a dab that she nearly died from a few minutes ago.
[01:38.310 --> 01:40.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Traveling Stoner is back on the podcast.
[01:40.310 --> 01:41.310]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:41.310 --> 01:42.310]  Are you okay after that dab?
[01:42.310 --> 01:43.310]  Yeah, I'm totally good.
[01:43.310 --> 01:44.310]  I really am.
[01:44.310 --> 01:45.310]  All right.
[01:45.310 --> 01:46.310]  You need a bottle of water?
[01:46.310 --> 01:47.310]  No, I totally have one over here.
[01:47.310 --> 01:48.310]  I'm totally good.
[01:48.310 --> 01:49.310]  That was 10 minutes ago, right?
[01:49.310 --> 01:50.310]  I know.
[01:50.310 --> 01:51.310]  I'm feeling better now.
[01:51.310 --> 01:52.310]  Thank you.
[01:52.310 --> 01:53.710]  And also, ladies and gentlemen, someone who's not on the show.
[01:53.710 --> 01:54.710]  He comes here often.
[01:54.710 --> 01:57.830]  He's kind of quiet, but the infamous Mr. Bobo Blaster Co. is here.
[01:57.830 --> 01:58.830]  Silent Bobo Blaster.
[01:58.830 --> 01:59.830]  Silent but deadly.
[01:59.830 --> 02:02.030]  Thanks for joining us, bro.
[02:02.030 --> 02:03.030]  Thank you for having me.
[02:03.030 --> 02:05.310]  Thanks for teaming up with me and making me not the only dude here.
[02:05.310 --> 02:06.310]  I was getting outnumbered.
[02:06.310 --> 02:07.310]  That's why I came here.
[02:07.310 --> 02:08.310]  I felt bad.
[02:08.310 --> 02:11.550]  I didn't want the odds to be that heavy.
[02:11.550 --> 02:13.550]  I think I could have handled it.
[02:13.550 --> 02:14.550]  Think about it, guys.
[02:14.550 --> 02:16.750]  We're going to talk about suppositories.
[02:16.750 --> 02:17.750]  Thank you, Granny.
[02:17.750 --> 02:19.030]  Granny got right to the point for us.
[02:19.030 --> 02:25.030]  Three ladies that have already medicated by sticking a suppository up their rectums.
[02:25.030 --> 02:27.030]  I'm just going to turn that down the music.
[02:27.030 --> 02:28.310]  We're going to get right to this.
[02:28.310 --> 02:32.190]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, at separate times, don't be dirty, but at separate times
[02:32.190 --> 02:37.290]  this evening, these three ladies stepped into my lovely pink restroom and nobody made fun
[02:37.290 --> 02:38.290]  of me for my pink restroom.
[02:38.290 --> 02:39.290]  Thank you.
[02:39.290 --> 02:40.290]  It is super pink in there.
[02:40.290 --> 02:43.290]  And they inserted and or applied some suppositories.
[02:43.290 --> 02:44.290]  Knuckle deep.
[02:44.290 --> 02:47.690]  We're going to talk about that a little bit.
[02:47.690 --> 02:49.930]  I don't have my notes out where I can see them, but I have it all in my head.
[02:49.930 --> 02:51.910]  We're going to talk about knuckle deep.
[02:51.910 --> 02:56.090]  Since Shannon is the newcomer and also the provider of the suppositories, not you personally,
[02:56.090 --> 02:57.950]  your company, we're going to talk about that.
[02:57.950 --> 03:02.210]  Tell us a little bit about the company and tell us about suppositories and then tell me
[03:02.210 --> 03:05.650]  about the dosage that everybody was just fed.
[03:05.650 --> 03:06.650]  My name is Shannon, obviously.
[03:07.010 --> 03:10.010]  I'm from Connoisseurs Genetics and Concentrates is the name of the company.
[03:10.010 --> 03:11.490]  We're based in Denver.
[03:11.490 --> 03:13.370]  We are solventless company.
[03:13.370 --> 03:15.130]  We've got rosin products.
[03:15.130 --> 03:20.330]  That's kind of our main, our main products, but we also carry the ancillary products,
[03:20.330 --> 03:21.450]  bath bombs.
[03:21.450 --> 03:23.250]  You might have seen them around town.
[03:23.250 --> 03:30.090]  They've become very big, but our suppositories are just kind of that silent medication that
[03:30.090 --> 03:34.610]  nobody's talking about, but it's so highly effective.
[03:35.410 --> 03:42.050]  With the new levels of chemicals that are allowed in solvents or in your concentrates,
[03:42.050 --> 03:46.150]  it's just a smarter, I mean, if you're applying this and you need it for medical reasons,
[03:46.150 --> 03:49.690]  you don't necessarily want those chemicals involved.
[03:49.690 --> 03:53.850]  So it's just a much better application.
[03:53.850 --> 03:57.410]  There's people who want to be medicated during the day, but can't afford to be high due to
[03:57.410 --> 03:59.290]  their jobs.
[03:59.290 --> 04:01.890]  This does not get you high per se.
[04:01.890 --> 04:03.170]  There is a euphoric feeling.
[04:03.890 --> 04:10.530]  When you can manage symptoms that have been killing you, it's just nice.
[04:10.530 --> 04:12.930]  It's a euphoric feeling when that relief-
[04:12.930 --> 04:17.250]  I did not, excuse me guys, my throat is wrecked from hanging out with Will.
[04:17.250 --> 04:20.950]  I did not use a suppository tonight, but I have tried one and euphoric is certainly one
[04:20.950 --> 04:22.850]  of the words I would use to describe it.
[04:22.850 --> 04:26.810]  None of my lower back pain was noticeable after using a suppository.
[04:26.810 --> 04:28.610]  So it definitely works for that.
[04:28.610 --> 04:30.650]  And it's the 70% absorption, right?
[04:30.650 --> 04:32.530]  I mean, edibles is 30.
[04:32.570 --> 04:33.890]  Talking is approximately 10.
[04:33.890 --> 04:37.090]  So it's the most effective way to get medicine.
[04:37.090 --> 04:39.890]  And you guys probably put them in, say 30 minutes ago-ish?
[04:39.890 --> 04:41.570]  About that, yeah.
[04:41.570 --> 04:42.570]  How well are they?
[04:42.570 --> 04:43.570]  I cheated.
[04:43.570 --> 04:44.570]  Granny cheated.
[04:44.570 --> 04:45.570]  Well, Granny, you're always going a little hardcore.
[04:45.570 --> 04:46.890]  Let's hear what you did.
[04:46.890 --> 04:50.330]  I put one in at home and I put one in here.
[04:50.330 --> 04:51.330]  She doubled up.
[04:51.330 --> 04:52.330]  So one for the road.
[04:52.330 --> 04:53.330]  I knew you would.
[04:53.330 --> 04:54.330]  Yeah.
[04:54.330 --> 04:59.210]  So that means Dad and Granny is actually medicated with 100 THC and 100 CBD.
[04:59.210 --> 05:04.490]  Me and Lindsey, since we've only done one, it's a 50-50, 50 THC, 50 CBD.
[05:04.490 --> 05:11.650]  But because we do cater to medical patients, I recently helped a colon cancer patient that's
[05:11.650 --> 05:16.410]  stage four and made 200-200 because that's what his recommended dosage.
[05:16.410 --> 05:19.250]  And that was just the most effective way for him to get that medicine.
[05:19.250 --> 05:20.970]  Are they working for him?
[05:20.970 --> 05:21.970]  We will find out.
[05:21.970 --> 05:24.970]  I just delivered those today specifically for that patient while I was down here.
[05:24.970 --> 05:25.970]  Hope those work.
[05:25.970 --> 05:27.530]  Thanks for coming all the way down to Pueblo also.
[05:27.530 --> 05:28.530]  I appreciate that.
[05:28.650 --> 05:30.690]  These guys are Colorado Springs dwellers.
[05:30.690 --> 05:31.690]  Colorado Springs.
[05:31.690 --> 05:32.690]  We're down here in the desert.
[05:32.690 --> 05:33.690]  It hasn't been the desert lately.
[05:33.690 --> 05:34.690]  It's nice today.
[05:34.690 --> 05:35.690]  Well, thanks for coming down.
[05:35.690 --> 05:36.690]  I appreciate it.
[05:36.690 --> 05:41.690]  So how many you got for 200 milligrams in you?
[05:41.690 --> 05:42.690]  Only 100.
[05:42.690 --> 05:43.690]  Only 100.
[05:43.690 --> 05:44.690]  Okay.
[05:44.690 --> 05:45.690]  How long did it take for the first one to kick in?
[05:45.690 --> 05:48.690]  Maybe 30 to 40 minutes.
[05:48.690 --> 05:51.690]  Lindsey, do you notice a difference since you don't go as frequently?
[05:51.690 --> 05:53.130]  Yeah, for sure.
[05:53.290 --> 05:58.290]  It definitely kicks in somewhere in the 30 to 40 minute range.
[05:58.290 --> 06:03.290]  It actually probably just kicked in about 10 minutes ago for me and I really was like,
[06:03.290 --> 06:05.690]  why can't I feel my legs?
[06:05.690 --> 06:08.730]  You also took a dab that made you cough that probably got your blood pressure moving.
[06:08.730 --> 06:10.650]  No, this was actually before the dab.
[06:10.650 --> 06:13.730]  I was actually, I looked down like right before the dab and I was like, why the hell?
[06:13.730 --> 06:14.730]  I was like, oh.
[06:14.730 --> 06:15.730]  Oh yeah.
[06:15.730 --> 06:18.250]  It's kind of a wash over feeling that you get.
[06:18.250 --> 06:20.610]  Like it just kind of washes over you.
[06:20.610 --> 06:23.970]  I explained it that it starts sort of in your tummy and then it sort of just spreads out
[06:23.970 --> 06:25.650]  and you can feel the medicine happen.
[06:25.650 --> 06:29.250]  It never got above my chest region.
[06:29.250 --> 06:31.050]  I never felt any medication above that.
[06:31.050 --> 06:34.570]  I've got some shoulder pain from a car accident and I never felt it there, but my knee pain
[06:34.570 --> 06:35.570]  was gone.
[06:35.570 --> 06:39.490]  My legs were, I don't know that I would want to take it the first two times and try to
[06:39.490 --> 06:40.490]  go to work.
[06:40.490 --> 06:41.970]  My job involves me on my feet working.
[06:41.970 --> 06:43.730]  I'm running laps basically all day.
[06:43.730 --> 06:46.610]  I don't know that my legs would have cooperated a hundred percent.
[06:46.610 --> 06:50.130]  It might've been a little too much for a day's work.
[06:50.650 --> 06:57.250]  When we first created these suppositories, I was making 15 milligram and 25 milligram
[06:57.250 --> 07:03.450]  as well, but I think it just got to the point where if you're in that much pain that you're
[07:03.450 --> 07:08.890]  willing to stick something up your rear, it's going to need to be seriously medicated.
[07:08.890 --> 07:13.690]  Like I'm not doing it just for 15 milligrams, but for 50 I'll go for it.
[07:13.690 --> 07:18.670]  So it seems to be the threshold is 50 is where everybody's comfortable jumping in that water.
[07:18.750 --> 07:22.350]  What is your demographic that's using your product?
[07:22.350 --> 07:24.310]  Do you see an apprehension from males?
[07:24.310 --> 07:28.830]  Are they afraid of using your product?
[07:28.830 --> 07:34.550]  I get apprehension when, like if I'm giving out samples and I give out one to one person,
[07:34.550 --> 07:35.550]  they're apprehensive.
[07:35.550 --> 07:39.430]  But if I give two people, they will usually team up and be like, yeah, I'll do it if you
[07:39.430 --> 07:40.430]  do it.
[07:40.430 --> 07:42.470]  It's not gender specific.
[07:42.470 --> 07:45.790]  I think it kind of goes across the board.
[07:45.910 --> 07:51.270]  Really the only thing we've focused on is the symptoms of helping with pain management
[07:51.270 --> 07:56.110]  or just the relief of that sensation.
[07:56.110 --> 08:01.150]  But for women, there's an alternate use as well that's not highly talked about and it
[08:01.150 --> 08:03.230]  makes men cringe.
[08:03.230 --> 08:07.070]  Is that monthly mistress that comes and visits.
[08:07.070 --> 08:08.590]  It can be a bitch.
[08:08.590 --> 08:14.030]  And if you have endometriosis or other things and men look at us and they know because they've
[08:14.030 --> 08:16.830]  seen their girlfriends wrench in pain, but they don't get it.
[08:16.830 --> 08:21.350]  Like girls actually, if you say that they're like, it relieves that and they are willing
[08:21.350 --> 08:23.230]  to use it.
[08:23.230 --> 08:25.030]  I'm sure Lindsey can attest to that.
[08:25.030 --> 08:27.070]  I know she suffers from that.
[08:27.070 --> 08:32.710]  Yeah, I actually, I have ovarian cysts, which is why I even have a medical card and, you
[08:32.710 --> 08:40.150]  know, I've suffered from it since I was about 16 years old and I truly didn't have full
[08:40.310 --> 08:46.470]  relief from my pain until I moved to Colorado and I had tried CBD for the first time.
[08:46.470 --> 08:50.470]  Even just dabs, like I couldn't believe how much that had taken away from me.
[08:50.470 --> 08:55.190]  And then the first time I ever took a suppository, I was in a lot of pain and Gail had given
[08:55.190 --> 09:02.790]  me one of them and I was like Gumby, you could barely move my bottom legs.
[09:02.790 --> 09:04.790]  Like I was just like so stoned.
[09:04.790 --> 09:06.550]  Did you say your bottom legs?
[09:06.550 --> 09:08.110]  Oh yeah, sorry.
[09:08.110 --> 09:09.630]  I did, didn't I?
[09:09.630 --> 09:11.630]  No one else caught it, did you?
[09:11.630 --> 09:13.630]  Nobody else caught it too.
[09:13.630 --> 09:15.630]  That was the best one.
[09:15.630 --> 09:17.630]  My bottom legs.
[09:17.630 --> 09:18.630]  Yeah.
[09:18.630 --> 09:22.630]  Sorry, my bottom half is what I meant to say.
[09:22.630 --> 09:24.630]  Oh, that was a good one.
[09:24.630 --> 09:28.630]  I just thought the podcast listeners might be envisioning you as a minotaur or something
[09:28.630 --> 09:29.630]  at this point.
[09:29.630 --> 09:30.630]  Like, wait, what is this lady?
[09:30.630 --> 09:32.630]  Damn, now I gotta go see what this bitch looks like.
[09:32.630 --> 09:33.630]  Her bottom legs.
[09:33.630 --> 09:35.630]  I wonder what her upper legs are looking like.
[09:35.630 --> 09:36.630]  That's so funny.
[09:36.630 --> 09:41.630]  Lindsay, would you say that the medicated feeling kind of comes in waves?
[09:41.630 --> 09:42.630]  Yes.
[09:42.630 --> 09:44.630]  You might think, okay, oh, that's it.
[09:44.630 --> 09:45.630]  It's peaked.
[09:45.630 --> 09:50.630]  But no, you get a good 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours.
[09:50.630 --> 09:55.630]  And it seems like the medicine knows where to go except for shoulder and neck pain.
[09:55.630 --> 10:00.630]  It kind of, once it goes past the heart, that's kind of like, you would have to, it would
[10:00.630 --> 10:02.630]  have to be applied differently.
[10:02.630 --> 10:03.630]  Because the heart's kind of there.
[10:04.630 --> 10:05.630]  It's running these blood vessels.
[10:05.630 --> 10:07.630]  Edibles get to my shoulders.
[10:07.630 --> 10:09.630]  If I eat it, it goes to my head and shoulders.
[10:09.630 --> 10:11.630]  It's a smart plant.
[10:11.630 --> 10:13.630]  I've said that cannabis knows where to go on this podcast.
[10:13.630 --> 10:16.630]  Our receptors are like, help me, help me.
[10:16.630 --> 10:18.630]  It finds the pain, it tickles the pain, it massages that out.
[10:18.630 --> 10:20.630]  And then if there's leftovers, it goes to your brain and makes you a little high.
[10:20.630 --> 10:22.630]  That's the way I feel cannabis does.
[10:22.630 --> 10:25.630]  Or if you consume like we do, it goes right to your brain.
[10:25.630 --> 10:27.630]  And then it goes to the other places.
[10:27.630 --> 10:28.630]  It knows.
[10:28.630 --> 10:29.630]  It is very smart.
[10:29.630 --> 10:30.630]  Actually, Lindsay texted me.
[10:31.630 --> 10:32.630]  I was trying to hang out with Lindsay one day.
[10:32.630 --> 10:33.630]  I was like, you want to hang out?
[10:33.630 --> 10:36.630]  And she's like, I hurt so bad, I can't even hang out.
[10:36.630 --> 10:39.630]  And I said, did you put one of those suppositories in there?
[10:39.630 --> 10:40.630]  And she was like, yeah.
[10:40.630 --> 10:41.630]  And I was like, okay.
[10:41.630 --> 10:43.630]  I actually recommended it.
[10:43.630 --> 10:45.630]  I was like, it might sound crazy, but go ahead and try that.
[10:45.630 --> 10:47.630]  And she's like, and they're done that already.
[10:47.630 --> 10:48.630]  Don't think I didn't think of that.
[10:48.630 --> 10:49.630]  That was two hours ago, Jeff.
[10:49.630 --> 10:51.630]  I'm still here, bro.
[10:51.630 --> 10:57.630]  I mean, I guess in a sense you can say it gets you high, but it's not the mental psychosis,
[10:57.630 --> 10:58.630]  anxiety that.
[10:58.630 --> 10:59.630]  Not at all.
[10:59.630 --> 11:00.630]  There's nothing mental.
[11:00.630 --> 11:02.630]  Anything above the shoulders is basically not.
[11:02.630 --> 11:06.630]  Floaty sort of my feet aren't touching the ground properly kind of a thing.
[11:06.630 --> 11:08.630]  Yeah, it's it's just socks were too thick.
[11:08.630 --> 11:09.630]  Yeah.
[11:09.630 --> 11:10.630]  Just to get the tingles.
[11:10.630 --> 11:17.630]  One thing we do need to say to the ladies, since you brought it up about monthly cycles, I recommend it all the time.
[11:17.630 --> 11:20.630]  But we need to let them know, don't be support.
[11:20.630 --> 11:22.630]  Don't do this vaginally.
[11:22.630 --> 11:23.630]  You can.
[11:23.630 --> 11:24.630]  Well, you can.
[11:24.630 --> 11:29.630]  But if you think about it, your monthly cycle is to flush things out.
[11:29.630 --> 11:35.630]  So if you're going to insert that suppository into your vagina, you're going to flush the medicine back out.
[11:35.630 --> 11:37.630]  Not to say.
[11:39.630 --> 11:40.630]  Pre-medicate, maybe.
[11:40.630 --> 11:41.630]  Maybe.
[11:41.630 --> 11:43.630]  Wouldn't putting it in your, in your butt do the same thing.
[11:43.630 --> 11:45.630]  Basically, it's going to get it there.
[11:45.630 --> 11:46.630]  Yeah.
[11:46.630 --> 11:47.630]  If you're just doing.
[11:47.630 --> 11:49.630]  But you have more membranes in your butt, so you might as well go.
[11:49.630 --> 11:50.630]  Yeah.
[11:50.630 --> 11:55.630]  I there I know there was a lady and they wasn't our suppositories.
[11:55.630 --> 12:05.630]  I didn't have any heart in it, but I do know that she had had bladder cancer or something more on the female area.
[12:05.630 --> 12:11.630]  So she used them vaginally and the cyst was going away with chemo on the outside, but they weren't going away on the inside.
[12:11.630 --> 12:16.630]  So by using the suppositories, she was able to reduce the ulcers on the inside.
[12:17.630 --> 12:20.630]  But she wasn't on her cycle when she was inserting them.
[12:20.630 --> 12:23.630]  She might not even have had one anymore, depending on age.
[12:23.630 --> 12:24.630]  Right.
[12:24.630 --> 12:26.630]  So we probably have all agreed.
[12:26.630 --> 12:29.630]  Don't don't use it vaginally when you were on your period.
[12:29.630 --> 12:34.630]  But if you do have an ovarian cyst, maybe put it in there if you're seeking relief and not on your cycle.
[12:34.630 --> 12:36.630]  So to be honest with you.
[12:36.630 --> 12:38.630]  Put it in your butt to get the pain relief.
[12:38.630 --> 12:39.630]  I kind of agree with.
[12:39.630 --> 12:40.630]  I can.
[12:40.630 --> 12:41.630]  Jesus.
[12:41.630 --> 12:43.630]  I kind of agree with Gail here.
[12:43.630 --> 12:49.630]  To be honest with you, I've only ever really put one in my vagina one or two times.
[12:49.630 --> 12:55.630]  Every other time that I've used them, which has been about a dozen now, has all been in my butt because.
[12:55.630 --> 12:58.630]  Oh, man, there's a lot of reasons.
[12:58.630 --> 13:00.630]  I'm going to cut that into a sound right.
[13:00.630 --> 13:02.630]  That's about a dozen times in my butt.
[13:02.630 --> 13:06.630]  I know that because you just showed me.
[13:06.630 --> 13:08.630]  Oh, are you really?
[13:08.630 --> 13:09.630]  Well, maybe.
[13:09.630 --> 13:10.630]  Oh, yeah, probably.
[13:10.630 --> 13:12.630]  I really got a spoof.
[13:12.630 --> 13:16.630]  Honestly, I hope so, because that's going to be an awesome ass like we can auto tune that.
[13:16.630 --> 13:17.630]  That's gonna be good.
[13:17.630 --> 13:18.630]  We can make a beat.
[13:18.630 --> 13:19.630]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[13:19.630 --> 13:20.630]  Twelve times in my butt.
[13:20.630 --> 13:21.630]  All right.
[13:21.630 --> 13:23.630]  But anyway, I just do real.
[13:23.630 --> 13:24.630]  That's cool.
[13:24.630 --> 13:25.630]  Because that's a track.
[13:25.630 --> 13:26.630]  Sell it to sloppy.
[13:26.630 --> 13:27.630]  He can rap over it.
[13:27.630 --> 13:28.630]  Oh, my God.
[13:28.630 --> 13:29.630]  Sloppy.
[13:29.630 --> 13:33.630]  I hope you're listening to this, my dude, because we're going to film it at Cana Canyon.
[13:33.630 --> 13:34.630]  It's going to be perfect.
[13:34.630 --> 13:36.630]  Camille gets work to it.
[13:36.630 --> 13:39.630]  I love my squad.
[13:39.630 --> 13:41.630]  I love my great family.
[13:41.630 --> 13:42.630]  We do.
[13:42.630 --> 13:47.630]  We can get because like the suppositories figure that's on here is just like a black whatever.
[13:47.630 --> 13:53.630]  And you know, at Halloween, they have those full black bodysuit things that are just we can totally be suppository dudes.
[13:53.630 --> 13:56.630]  Suppository dudes.
[13:56.630 --> 14:02.630]  You know, Shannon, maybe we should tell them about the size of the suppositories just because, you know, they do cringe.
[14:02.630 --> 14:04.630]  Just I was just going to say that to you.
[14:04.630 --> 14:07.630]  The other thing that I really wanted before I forget, because I'm really stoned.
[14:08.630 --> 14:13.630]  I like to throw them in the freezer for about five to ten minutes before I use it.
[14:13.630 --> 14:22.630]  So that way, because I'm an idiot and I leave them in when I first get them, I leave them in my bag or somewhere and they kind of not melt, but they just get a little soft.
[14:22.630 --> 14:23.630]  Exactly.
[14:23.630 --> 14:24.630]  Just like our.
[14:24.630 --> 14:29.630]  They just get a little bit soft and I don't you know, I don't want to have any issues, any crumble, any breakage.
[14:29.630 --> 14:33.630]  So I throw it in the freezer just so it hardens up just that tiny bit.
[14:33.630 --> 14:36.630]  And then it's super easy to insert and there's no issues with it.
[14:36.630 --> 14:40.630]  So if you're looking for a super easy way to do it, that is my tip for that.
[14:40.630 --> 14:43.630]  That is how I typically store mine in the refrigerator or the freezer.
[14:43.630 --> 14:48.630]  We keep them in the freezer at one night once they cure and everything and I seal them.
[14:48.630 --> 14:51.630]  So it's definitely, you know, a cooler temperature.
[14:51.630 --> 14:54.630]  Obviously, it's we don't use coconut oil.
[14:54.630 --> 14:55.630]  The reason that we don't.
[14:55.630 --> 15:04.630]  And if you if you check any YouTube or any of those type of forums, they will all say use coconut oil.
[15:04.630 --> 15:09.630]  Well, we don't use coconut oil because there's a lot of people who have allergies to it that have developed.
[15:09.630 --> 15:11.630]  So we try to avoid that.
[15:11.630 --> 15:14.630]  We actually use cocoa butter and beeswax to.
[15:14.630 --> 15:17.630]  And so that's why ours are a little.
[15:17.630 --> 15:20.630]  They stay firmer even when they're not in the freezer.
[15:20.630 --> 15:27.630]  Like some of the others I know, because when they're made out of coconut oil, the second you touch it, it starts to melt, regardless of how you've stored it.
[15:27.630 --> 15:37.630]  So, you know, I try to be conscious of all common allergies and things that may affect patients, especially with their immune systems already being compromised.
[15:37.630 --> 15:39.630]  You said you make them out of solventless.
[15:39.630 --> 15:43.630]  Can you can you teach our listeners that may not know what solventless hash is?
[15:43.630 --> 15:44.630]  Can you give them a quick lesson?
[15:44.630 --> 15:45.630]  And if you need a hand, we'll jump in.
[15:45.630 --> 15:46.630]  Yeah, absolutely.
[15:46.630 --> 15:47.630]  Thank you.
[15:47.630 --> 15:50.630]  I actually kind of have this one.
[15:51.630 --> 15:59.630]  So depending on what kind of concentrate we're making, we make everything is done with either heat and pressure or ice and water.
[15:59.630 --> 16:01.630]  We don't use any chemicals throughout the process.
[16:01.630 --> 16:06.630]  I mean, they're solvent free, which means there are solvents used, but they've been removed for us.
[16:06.630 --> 16:09.630]  We never this product never touches a solvent.
[16:09.630 --> 16:16.630]  OK, even in our grow, it's it's as close to organic as you can get, you know, to get certified organic costs a lot of money and we're still new.
[16:16.630 --> 16:24.630]  So that's in our in our coming days or years, probably when we can truly go full organic.
[16:24.630 --> 16:28.630]  But with the process, things are removed.
[16:28.630 --> 16:36.630]  So if it's star melt, say we we make it into hash with ice and water.
[16:36.630 --> 16:39.630]  OK, we've got a hash guy that makes that.
[16:39.630 --> 16:41.630]  And then from there, we press that.
[16:41.630 --> 16:42.630]  We'll sift it.
[16:42.630 --> 16:44.630]  We get the truthful melt and we get our different microns.
[16:45.630 --> 16:50.630]  And then from there, if it's not doesn't meet our standards of truthful melt, then we press it into rosin.
[16:50.630 --> 16:58.630]  And that just is you know, that it's a ninety five percent, typically THC level about that.
[16:58.630 --> 17:02.630]  And, you know, we always have the testing on those and it varies a lot.
[17:02.630 --> 17:05.630]  For our nug melt, we just take the flour.
[17:05.630 --> 17:08.630]  It's all about how you cure it, how it's grown.
[17:08.630 --> 17:11.630]  The strains you use are important.
[17:11.630 --> 17:20.630]  And we just take it and it's processed down and we just press the flour with heat and pressure, which makes a rosin as well, which is becoming more and more popular.
[17:20.630 --> 17:22.630]  Right. A lot of my listeners might not know.
[17:22.630 --> 17:31.630]  So I'm going to give them just a it's basically you're taking a really high tech George Foreman grill and squishing a bud in a George into a George Foreman grill and some juice strips out of it.
[17:31.630 --> 17:33.630]  And that juice is very potent.
[17:34.630 --> 17:38.630]  I am not a huge fan of rosin smoking by itself because I usually don't like the flavor.
[17:38.630 --> 17:42.630]  If it's done, if it's made, if you take hash and make rosin out of hash, that tastes good.
[17:42.630 --> 17:46.630]  But I don't think squishing the bud makes flavorful.
[17:46.630 --> 17:47.630]  A lot of people are huge fans of it.
[17:47.630 --> 17:48.630]  They're going to hate me for that.
[17:48.630 --> 17:49.630]  They are.
[17:49.630 --> 17:52.630]  They are. But it's not it tastes like it all tastes like burnt popcorn or a popsicle stick.
[17:52.630 --> 17:57.630]  Now, and in that's where the differentiation is with nug melt.
[17:57.630 --> 17:59.630]  That means it's not being done right.
[17:59.630 --> 18:07.630]  OK, if it's not being done right, which means it's being exposed either too long to the heat or too high of a temperature for too long, you get that popcorn.
[18:07.630 --> 18:09.630]  OK, popcorn.
[18:09.630 --> 18:10.630]  Exactly.
[18:10.630 --> 18:13.630]  And I'm not going to say it's never happened in our kitchen.
[18:13.630 --> 18:22.630]  But if that happens, those could turn into ancillary products, bath bombs like we'd that's not something that we would put on the shelf as something that we would say smoke this because it doesn't taste right.
[18:23.630 --> 18:27.630]  You know, we've really worked on perfecting the cure in the taste.
[18:27.630 --> 18:30.630]  And when we press it, the time and it's a science.
[18:30.630 --> 18:34.630]  So and that's something that we've been really working on for a long time.
[18:34.630 --> 18:40.630]  So I believe there was I think we had some nug melt here.
[18:40.630 --> 18:42.630]  I'll make sure that you actually get to try it.
[18:42.630 --> 18:44.630]  I'll prove your popcorn.
[18:44.630 --> 18:46.630]  I love to dab.
[18:46.630 --> 18:47.630]  I'm not a hater.
[18:47.630 --> 18:48.630]  I'll see you're in.
[18:48.630 --> 18:51.630]  And I in you are 100 percent correct.
[18:51.630 --> 18:53.630]  If it is not done right, that's exactly what it tastes like.
[18:53.630 --> 18:55.630]  It sounds like you guys have mastered the tech.
[18:55.630 --> 19:01.630]  So you're taking properly done rosin and then making that into a liquid that's able to be put into the suppositories.
[19:01.630 --> 19:02.630]  Correct.
[19:02.630 --> 19:05.630]  It's it's I have a formulation.
[19:05.630 --> 19:09.630]  I know what calculations to make as far as so to make potencies and whatnot.
[19:10.630 --> 19:13.630]  And based on how many I'm making, it's just it's formula.
[19:13.630 --> 19:19.630]  And I just take the rosin and and the CBDs and just melt it down within the cocoa butter.
[19:19.630 --> 19:22.630]  And, you know, your ratios, I know my ratios, proprietary mixtures and such.
[19:22.630 --> 19:23.630]  Correct.
[19:23.630 --> 19:25.630]  And you you had said something about size, Gail.
[19:25.630 --> 19:34.630]  And, you know, size is if I said, you know, the end of your pinky, that's going to vary because everybody's pinkies a different size.
[19:35.630 --> 19:40.630]  So there are two it's two grams is what it weighs out in an amount.
[19:40.630 --> 19:48.630]  So it's a liquid and maybe a half an inch, half an inch, you know, torpedoes, multiple liquid.
[19:48.630 --> 19:51.630]  It's I mean, they they're the same size as a fleet suppository.
[19:51.630 --> 19:52.630]  There you go.
[19:52.630 --> 19:57.630]  I mean, if you've ever used any type of suppository, it's the exact same size.
[19:57.630 --> 20:02.630]  We're buying the same molds from the same companies that the major players buy from.
[20:02.630 --> 20:05.630]  Somebody out there is going to argue with us and say that water is a solvent.
[20:05.630 --> 20:09.630]  Yes, we know water is a solvent, but it's not being used as a it.
[20:09.630 --> 20:12.630]  We get that. But it's being used more as an agitator in this situation.
[20:12.630 --> 20:14.630]  And it's not a harmful. Right.
[20:14.630 --> 20:18.630]  But but still, people are haters. And so I just want to leave them a footnote.
[20:18.630 --> 20:20.630]  We get it. Water is a solvent in this situation.
[20:20.630 --> 20:24.630]  It's not the ice is being used as more like a beater to break off the tricone.
[20:24.630 --> 20:26.630]  So don't don't get at me because I know someone's going to say that.
[20:26.630 --> 20:28.630]  And it is in its R.O.
[20:28.630 --> 20:30.630]  So it's right. Of course, water is technically.
[20:30.630 --> 20:37.630]  But isn't it solventless in the fact that like the water isn't changing the properties of it,
[20:37.630 --> 20:43.630]  whereas like when B.H.O. and P.H.O. is run through it, it physically changes it and chemically changes it.
[20:43.630 --> 20:46.630]  Depends on how big of an Internet troll you are. That's why that's why I'm telling everybody.
[20:46.630 --> 20:52.630]  But I'm but that's what I'm saying. That ends it right there, because water doesn't change the chemical properties of it.
[20:52.630 --> 20:56.630]  I just text that to make it so that he can use that because he is the one that tells us about.
[20:56.630 --> 20:59.630]  He will say, guys, you say this is solvent.
[20:59.630 --> 21:02.630]  Yeah. Shout out to Nick. No, he's the one that tells us that water is not a solvent.
[21:02.630 --> 21:06.630]  He's the one that's always got to give that speech because he created the hashtag solventless.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.630]  Yeah. All right. I'm going to put it back on track. I know where I was.
[21:08.630 --> 21:11.630]  We're talking about the size of suppositories. Yes.
[21:11.630 --> 21:15.630]  Let's talk about my favorite word insertion. It's not that bad.
[21:15.630 --> 21:19.630]  You guys, a lot of dudes, a lot of people looking like really going to put that in your butt, bro.
[21:19.630 --> 21:24.630]  Like they said, you're not putting you guys not using a dildo.
[21:24.630 --> 21:28.630]  You eat all day. You take giant shit. So little things not going to affect your butt.
[21:28.630 --> 21:31.630]  It's smaller than any poop you've ever thrown out. Don't be scared.
[21:31.630 --> 21:39.630]  But right there, Jeff, is what you men say. No, that hole is meant for stuff to come out, not stuff to go in.
[21:39.630 --> 21:43.630]  A lot of. Yeah. At first when you say suppository, that's what my natural reaction is.
[21:43.630 --> 21:47.630]  But then I think I'm a logical dude. I understand science. I understand my body.
[21:47.630 --> 21:50.630]  I know how this is going to work. How high are we going to get? Let's do this.
[21:50.630 --> 21:54.630]  It's not so it just literally you just put it in your butt.
[21:54.630 --> 21:58.630]  You guys, you go like like about a knuckle, maybe a knuckle and a half.
[21:58.630 --> 22:04.630]  And if you're that frightened, put a little lubricant just like you were having sex.
[22:04.630 --> 22:09.630]  I mean, it's already a lubricant and it's cocoa butter. I don't think you need it.
[22:09.630 --> 22:13.630]  Do you, Lindsay? No, no, definitely not. You guys are laughing. What's the story over here?
[22:13.630 --> 22:16.630]  I want to know what I missed. Yes. Yes.
[22:16.630 --> 22:22.630]  But I was jokingly spitting in my hand as you turned to me and I was like, oh, Jesus Christ.
[22:22.630 --> 22:28.630]  We were just spin on it. So there's exchanging. My friends at work were like, how do you how do you know how when it's in right now?
[22:28.630 --> 22:32.630]  Well, if you push too far, your body pushes it down a little. It's like, nope.
[22:32.630 --> 22:34.630]  And then if you don't go far enough, it falls out.
[22:34.630 --> 22:41.630]  So it's called that second sphincter muscle. Really? You know, Jeff, you know, it's comfortably right in one spot.
[22:41.630 --> 22:47.630]  Kind of. You know, it's there. But yeah, it only lasts a couple of minutes, like five minutes.
[22:47.630 --> 22:52.630]  And this is going to sound crazy, but I mean, I guess whatever I'm tired, I'll just say this.
[22:52.630 --> 23:01.630]  As long as you get it completely in, you can kind of like squeeze your butt cheeks and push it the rest of the way without needing to get knuckles.
[23:01.630 --> 23:03.630]  It'll kind of put itself where it needs to be. Yeah.
[23:03.630 --> 23:10.630]  If you're really that squeamish about your butthole, you can just like get it all the way in there physically.
[23:10.630 --> 23:15.630]  And then you can just use your own butt cheeks to just squeeze it in there and then wash your hands before you come take.
[23:15.630 --> 23:22.630]  Please. Wait, wait, wait. Let me let me disclose. It is important since you are possibly inserting your finger.
[23:22.630 --> 23:28.630]  You do want to wash your hands before you. But let me just say that because there'll be those.
[23:28.630 --> 23:34.630]  It'll be like, oh, I was supposed to wash my hands before, too. You know, yeah, we're not all savages.
[23:34.630 --> 23:38.630]  Wash your hands, ladies and gentlemen. All right.
[23:38.630 --> 23:43.630]  I'm going to bring up another thing that maybe people are squeamish to talk about, but I do get asked this.
[23:43.630 --> 23:49.630]  What about leakage? Okay. See, I'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I was going to say earlier when we got derailed.
[23:49.630 --> 23:55.630]  And I realized, guys, we are truly talking medicating here. That's some of the subjects might be.
[23:55.630 --> 24:00.630]  And if you're 15 years old, then don't listen to us. This is we are truly talking about medicating here.
[24:00.630 --> 24:05.630]  And it's not all going to be suppository talk. You guys are going to talk more stuff also.
[24:05.630 --> 24:16.630]  This is going to sound crazy, but like I mean, like I don't put them in vaginally because I am always afraid that like I'm going to take a dab afterwards and cough really hard or like right.
[24:16.630 --> 24:25.630]  And like do and like. Two sound bites in one show.
[24:25.630 --> 24:34.630]  How many sound bites can we rack up in a podcast? But yeah, it's I mean, it's not like a super big, like fear of mine.
[24:34.630 --> 24:41.630]  I mean, like don't be children. I don't think it's going to just fall out of my vagina. I don't think I have like anyways.
[24:41.630 --> 24:47.630]  Oh, you dab. Oh, three, three.
[24:47.630 --> 24:54.630]  But anyways, yeah. So that's why I actually don't use them that way, because I'm super afraid of like sneezing.
[24:54.630 --> 25:01.630]  Yeah. Oh, that's another one. Yeah. You guys can't see the tears coming out of everybody's faces on this podcast right now.
[25:01.630 --> 25:08.630]  That is great. We had a moment. Yeah, we're all best friends now.
[25:08.630 --> 25:12.630]  I'm finally coming back around from the dabs that I had earlier.
[25:12.630 --> 25:16.630]  Will came over and he's like, try this Skywalker hash. And he gave me like at least a half gram.
[25:16.630 --> 25:20.630]  And as I was taking, I was like, well, there goes the fucking podcast.
[25:20.630 --> 25:29.630]  Shannon and I were the first ones here. And I looked at Will and Jeff and I was like, what's wrong with these two? Are they tired?
[25:29.630 --> 25:37.630]  I looked at Jeff and I was like, you look tired. He said, no, I'm just kind of high. I'm dabbed out for a minute.
[25:37.630 --> 25:40.630]  Yes. I'm coming around. Shout out to Dr. Pepper and good friends and laughter.
[25:40.630 --> 25:44.630]  Bring me back on. I'm going to take a dab in a minute. Yes. Yes.
[25:44.630 --> 25:47.630]  Take a dab in a second. Fix myself. All right, Lindsay.
[25:47.630 --> 25:51.630]  We never really finished about leakage. No, I mean, but honestly,
[25:51.630 --> 25:54.630]  And her gaping hole that's in.
[25:54.630 --> 25:57.630]  Yeah, please start that rumor. Jesus Christ.
[25:57.630 --> 26:01.630]  So I've never personally experienced leakage with the anal.
[26:01.630 --> 26:04.630]  Me neither. With either one of them.
[26:04.630 --> 26:09.630]  But it's possible because it's a liquid product and it's if you don't go far enough.
[26:09.630 --> 26:13.630]  Yes. I mean, if you're timid and you don't and it's hanging on the edge.
[26:13.630 --> 26:16.630]  Yeah, it's probably going to have a little leakage. And there's going to be some meltage.
[26:16.630 --> 26:20.630]  Yes, it's going to come out in your underwear. And you're going to be basically wasting the medicine in it.
[26:20.630 --> 26:23.630]  You're not going to it's not going to be absorbing if it is.
[26:23.630 --> 26:26.630]  So if that happens, like it's not the end of the world.
[26:26.630 --> 26:30.630]  Wash your clothes, wash your underwear and go to the dispensary and get another one.
[26:30.630 --> 26:33.630]  Get another one. Push a little further. Go a little deeper.
[26:33.630 --> 26:36.630]  Go a little go a little bit. But in reality, there should not be any leakage.
[26:36.630 --> 26:39.630]  No, I have yet to have any.
[26:39.630 --> 26:47.630]  I know potato chips that have given me worse side effects than I've had from from Chipotle.
[26:48.630 --> 26:57.630]  So I really couldn't say that there's any super negative side effects that stand out to me.
[26:57.630 --> 26:59.630]  Would you? No, not at all.
[26:59.630 --> 27:01.630]  So here's a random question.
[27:01.630 --> 27:05.630]  If somebody gets a hold of these and they don't have the proper labeling and they eat one, what's going to go wrong?
[27:05.630 --> 27:10.630]  Nothing there, but it's basically 50 milligrams THC and 50 milligrams CBD.
[27:10.630 --> 27:13.630]  It is going to be processed. I was just going to ask that.
[27:13.630 --> 27:17.630]  So you are probably going to get a head high and not feel a lot of pain relief.
[27:17.630 --> 27:20.630]  It's going to be a different high, but it is edible.
[27:20.630 --> 27:24.630]  It's cocoa butter and it's beeswax. It's nothing. It's organic.
[27:24.630 --> 27:31.630]  But we do ask that you be responsible medicators and keep these products away from your children and your pets.
[27:31.630 --> 27:33.630]  Yes. Yes.
[27:33.630 --> 27:36.630]  What type of I was going to ask, could we use these for our pets?
[27:36.630 --> 27:41.630]  But then I was like, I don't even want to journey down that road right now after the conversation we just had.
[27:41.630 --> 27:43.630]  So I'm going to go with another question.
[27:43.630 --> 27:46.630]  What are what are you going to insert it in my dog's?
[27:46.630 --> 27:48.630]  Right. Come here, Fido.
[27:48.630 --> 27:50.630]  Does that go back to the horse thing?
[27:50.630 --> 27:59.630]  Oh, so these these young ladies had a conversation about a documentary where people were having sex with their farm animals.
[27:59.630 --> 28:01.630]  I did not bring it up. I didn't start it.
[28:01.630 --> 28:03.630]  These ladies did this to us here earlier.
[28:03.630 --> 28:07.630]  What I was going to ask really, though, was what type of conditions would you recommend?
[28:07.630 --> 28:12.630]  Like if you had just a list of conditions and if you're like suppositories will fix that, what would you go for first?
[28:12.630 --> 28:22.630]  I'm pain in any kind of, you know, symptoms that you have where you need that extra relief.
[28:22.630 --> 28:26.630]  I would say. Nerve is ending.
[28:26.630 --> 28:31.630]  I'm going to say anybody. Can I use my own personal experience?
[28:31.630 --> 28:34.630]  What's your granny? Those are the best, best ways to describe things.
[28:34.630 --> 28:39.630]  I took a year and I weaned my husband off opioids with the help of these suppositories.
[28:39.630 --> 28:41.630]  Oh, wow. OK.
[28:41.630 --> 28:45.630]  With CBDs and suppositories, Kevin is now opioid free.
[28:45.630 --> 28:48.630]  Congrats, Kevin. And he was stubborn about cannabis, wasn't he?
[28:48.630 --> 28:51.630]  He will smoke, but he didn't want to do suppositories.
[28:51.630 --> 28:53.630]  He didn't want to do CBDs.
[28:53.630 --> 28:56.630]  He he's an old hippie. He'll smoke his bowls.
[28:56.630 --> 29:07.630]  OK. But at the beginning of 2016, he was on 75 micrograms of fentanyl, which was to be changed every 72 hours.
[29:07.630 --> 29:18.630]  40 milligrams of extended release morphine, two times a day, 15 milligrams of immediate release morphine.
[29:18.630 --> 29:20.630]  Five times a day as needed.
[29:20.630 --> 29:22.630]  So he was basically a numb zombie.
[29:23.630 --> 29:27.630]  Yeah, he was falling down a lot and I was like, enough of this shit.
[29:27.630 --> 29:29.630]  Not eating, not pooping, not communicating.
[29:29.630 --> 29:32.630]  That's when Shannon and I first met. I was like, I can't do this.
[29:32.630 --> 29:36.630]  And she was like, well, I'll help you. She gave me some products.
[29:36.630 --> 29:41.630]  She gave me those suppositories. At first, he said, you stick that up your butt.
[29:41.630 --> 29:45.630]  And I said, are you kidding? After 45 years of marriage, you're going to tell me that?
[29:45.630 --> 29:51.630]  Are you kidding me? Stick this little pinky thing compared to some.
[29:51.630 --> 29:57.630]  So I said, OK, if I do it, you have to do it. I did it. He did it.
[29:57.630 --> 29:59.630]  And he's like, you're right. They're not so bad.
[29:59.630 --> 30:03.630]  If I remember correctly, it was he had had a colonoscopy that day.
[30:03.630 --> 30:07.630]  So you were like, you've already had it stretched out. You might as well just go for it.
[30:07.630 --> 30:09.630]  It's already inflated.
[30:09.630 --> 30:14.630]  So that was when he said, you know what? You're right. I've already been violated once.
[30:14.630 --> 30:19.630]  And they work. So he is someone that is in a lot of chronic pain.
[30:19.630 --> 30:23.630]  I mean, those to be prescribed that much morphine to begin with.
[30:23.630 --> 30:26.630]  Absolutely. Are those the coins that looks like a quarter?
[30:26.630 --> 30:30.630]  What the morphine pills? No, they're actually very small.
[30:30.630 --> 30:36.630]  OK. And then, you know, then the government has gotten to the point also where they're like, oh,
[30:36.630 --> 30:38.630]  we're going to let you take all these pills for 10 years.
[30:38.630 --> 30:40.630]  And now we're going to take them away from you.
[30:40.630 --> 30:42.630]  Yeah. That happened to a friend of mine recently.
[30:42.630 --> 30:46.630]  Yes. And then we have people going out onto the streets and they're buying them.
[30:47.630 --> 30:52.630]  And we're getting more heroin addicts now because heroin is cheaper than pills on the streets.
[30:52.630 --> 30:59.630]  So, guys, I'm telling you, cannabis, I'll tell you, if you have an opioid addiction.
[30:59.630 --> 31:05.630]  These suppositories help you get rid of it, because when you start kicking opioids, you get sick.
[31:05.630 --> 31:11.630]  Yeah. Even if you try to wean slowly, you get sick.
[31:11.630 --> 31:13.630]  Your body missing it. You've been.
[31:13.630 --> 31:16.630]  But you don't need it. Right. Yeah. But your body doesn't know that yet.
[31:16.630 --> 31:19.630]  So, yeah. Well, congrats to. Is he still as grumpy?
[31:19.630 --> 31:23.630]  Yeah. All right. But he's going to Vegas with me. Live up to his name.
[31:23.630 --> 31:25.630]  Well, do we want to brag about that for a second?
[31:25.630 --> 31:29.630]  Are we? We should finish. OK, let's keep talking about why I have a good way of putting this back.
[31:29.630 --> 31:32.630]  Sometimes I might forget, though. But yeah, more conditions.
[31:32.630 --> 31:39.630]  So obviously, I mean, any kind of lower extremities, I would say anywhere from, you know, the heart down,
[31:40.630 --> 31:45.630]  you could you could find relief in some way. It just depends on what your symptoms are.
[31:45.630 --> 31:49.630]  I mean, there's because it's a one to one ratio, 50 50 THC and CBD.
[31:50.630 --> 31:55.630]  You're getting the benefits of both. So it's just it's the two catalyze each other.
[31:56.630 --> 32:00.630]  It's just overall beneficial. I mean, the list could go on and on.
[32:00.630 --> 32:05.630]  But I mean, for me personally, it's nerve damage, sciatic nerve issues.
[32:06.630 --> 32:08.630]  I was almost paralyzed in a jet ski accident.
[32:08.630 --> 32:13.630]  So, you know, it flares up from time to time and it swells up.
[32:13.630 --> 32:17.630]  So and that's what I use them. OK, girls obviously use them for endometriosis.
[32:17.630 --> 32:25.630]  Cancer patients use it to relieve symptoms, you know, from their cancer.
[32:25.630 --> 32:28.630]  OK, whatever it might be. I mean, well, let's say you're in cancer.
[32:28.630 --> 32:32.630]  If you're on chemo. Yeah. You're probably really nauseous.
[32:32.630 --> 32:34.630]  And what are they going to do? They're going to give you pharmaceuticals.
[32:34.630 --> 32:38.630]  They're going to give you a chitral. So, Fran, there's all these pills
[32:38.630 --> 32:41.630]  they're going to give you so you don't get sick. Well, guess what?
[32:42.630 --> 32:45.630]  You don't need those pills. You can insert one of these suppositories.
[32:45.630 --> 32:48.630]  It's going to help with the nauseousness. It's going to help with the pain.
[32:49.630 --> 32:52.630]  It's not going to cure your cancer. That's not what we're saying.
[32:52.630 --> 32:57.630]  But it will make the quality of of what you're going through at that time better.
[32:57.630 --> 33:01.630]  It'll make it. I think it will. Absolutely.
[33:01.630 --> 33:04.630]  I mean, we've all experienced it in our own experiences.
[33:04.630 --> 33:07.630]  And that's why that's why I'm such an advocate for this.
[33:07.630 --> 33:11.630]  I mean, you know, the 70 percent absorption rate is huge.
[33:11.630 --> 33:14.630]  When you smoke things, it's about a 10 percent ratio.
[33:14.630 --> 33:16.630]  When you eat it, it's 30 percent.
[33:16.630 --> 33:19.630]  So they're getting 70 percent of that 50 50.
[33:19.630 --> 33:22.630]  And that's a huge amount. Quickly, very quickly.
[33:22.630 --> 33:24.630]  Yeah, it comes on quickly and it lasts for quite a long time.
[33:24.630 --> 33:28.630]  Like, I don't know when I take dabs, I get maybe a good 30, 40 minute buzz out of it.
[33:28.630 --> 33:30.630]  But the suppository, you're lucky.
[33:30.630 --> 33:33.630]  Well, you know, the lingering part that 15 minutes of is cool.
[33:33.630 --> 33:36.630]  But then you just get that. I might be kind of still give you some cookies or something.
[33:36.630 --> 33:40.630]  But yeah, they come on quickly and they last. They seem to last a long time.
[33:40.630 --> 33:43.630]  Yeah. The waves go for quite a while. Yeah. The waves.
[33:43.630 --> 33:46.630]  Yeah. The waves are fun. I noticed that for sure. For sure.
[33:46.630 --> 33:53.630]  I was thinking maybe I would take them if I had to go on a plane ride or a car trip where I'm sitting for a long time because my lower back and my knees start to get mad about that.
[33:53.630 --> 33:57.630]  So it might be cool to have those on a plane trip or something where I'm cramped in the car.
[33:57.630 --> 34:04.630]  I have that same like anytime I'm sitting for a long time and I drive a lot just with calling on dispensaries and just getting the word out.
[34:04.630 --> 34:10.630]  So I don't typically do it while I'm driving just because, like you said, it kind of deadens.
[34:10.630 --> 34:18.630]  Like I want to have my reaction times. But as soon as I stop or have, you know, at the end of the day, I'm taking them for the relief.
[34:18.630 --> 34:22.630]  Computer time when you're home doing the computer work, sitting there in the chair, letting your bottom half go numb.
[34:22.630 --> 34:26.630]  Yeah. Sounds perfect. All right. I like it. It's a good product.
[34:26.630 --> 34:29.630]  You guys all have the same look on your face. Everybody's all stone.
[34:29.630 --> 34:34.630]  Everybody that used a suppository had the same look on their face. They were all bobbing their head at the same rhythm. That was pretty funny.
[34:34.630 --> 34:37.630]  What other products do you carry, though, at CGC?
[34:37.630 --> 34:45.630]  Yeah. We also one of our highest things that we've been been popular have been our bath bombs.
[34:45.630 --> 34:51.630]  They have we have three different kinds. There's 100 milligram THC with 15 CBD.
[34:51.630 --> 34:56.630]  Again, we've got the solventless in there. They're foaming bath bombs. So they have the experience.
[34:56.630 --> 35:01.630]  There's actually bubbles involved and colors. Colors are involved.
[35:01.630 --> 35:05.630]  Not we don't heavily color them again. Want to keep it as clean as possible.
[35:05.630 --> 35:10.630]  But there is a color in there, of course, differentiates scents and things like that.
[35:10.630 --> 35:25.630]  Lavender and citrus ginger. And I know, Granny, when I offered her products, she loves our solventless caviar, loves the suppositories, obviously, you know, definitely dabs are rosen.
[35:25.630 --> 35:29.630]  But she was like, yeah, I'm not a bath person. And so I respect that.
[35:29.630 --> 35:34.630]  You don't take baths, Granny? No, I like showers. I don't either. I should just throw in the shower.
[35:34.630 --> 35:41.630]  I don't want to lay in my own dirty. So recently she she caught a cold and I saw her on Facebook or on Instagram on one of our live feeds.
[35:41.630 --> 35:49.630]  And I was heading down this way. So I just I dropped some stuff off at one of our epic remedies, one of the local dispensaries that we do business with.
[35:49.630 --> 35:56.630]  And Granny, I know shops there and we all do. Yeah, I was just going to say that. Yeah, they're a great company.
[35:56.630 --> 36:04.630]  So I just dropped it off and text her and I said, I know you're not a bath person, but this will make you feel better.
[36:04.630 --> 36:09.630]  And I dropped her off some eucalyptus mint once. She's hooked. They were wonderful.
[36:09.630 --> 36:14.630]  The effervescence, the eucalyptus opened up everything.
[36:14.630 --> 36:19.630]  The CBDs had me relaxed. I was down with just my nose out.
[36:19.630 --> 36:27.630]  And then when the water got cold, I let some out. I ran all our hot water out. That's how long I just oh, these are pretty nice.
[36:27.630 --> 36:34.630]  And I've done probably four of them since then. Very cool. I love watching the girls on Instagram and YouTube drop the bath bomb in there.
[36:34.630 --> 36:41.630]  Do you take a bath bomb? I don't really do baths. I'm six foot five. So getting in and out of the bath is more painful than it's worth.
[36:42.630 --> 36:46.630]  Yeah, I can't get all your body parts in the tub at the same time.
[36:46.630 --> 36:53.630]  Yeah, you would need a hot tub size. Yes. I've gone to some hotels just because I know they have big hot tubs or big bathtubs.
[36:53.630 --> 37:00.630]  That's why they get me at some places. All you gonjapreneurs out there. What we need is a CBD showerhead.
[37:00.630 --> 37:06.630]  Right. Wow. An isolation tank filled with CBD water.
[37:07.630 --> 37:13.630]  Oh, yeah. They make that CBD water. You put a bath bomb in the float tank.
[37:13.630 --> 37:21.630]  What would that do? So, yeah, in the bath bombs, there's actually there's all kinds of beneficial other things in there, including the THC and CBD.
[37:21.630 --> 37:30.630]  But there's Epsom salts and essential oils and a few other things that bind it together and make it pretty. So make it foam.
[37:30.630 --> 37:36.630]  How much of the cannabinoids does your skin develop or develop? That's not the word I wanted, but I think you know what I meant.
[37:36.630 --> 37:44.630]  Yeah. Incorporate. Soak in. Yeah. Yeah. Absorb. Absorb. Thank you. I ruined everybody. Nobody could find it. Granny had to help us out.
[37:44.630 --> 37:50.630]  I know. Thank you. Shannon got it first. No, actually, you did. But all our lower legs don't.
[37:50.630 --> 38:00.630]  I honestly don't have a there's no science that has I could quote that I would feel comfortable saying it's this kind of percentage.
[38:00.630 --> 38:05.630]  It just from everything. I mean, your skin is your largest organ. Right.
[38:05.630 --> 38:10.630]  So it's obviously when you get in a tub of hot water, it's absorbing. We know Epsom salts in those.
[38:10.630 --> 38:20.630]  So it's just collecting on and absorbing into your skin. People, the effects that they've had is they say that it's the best night's sleep they've ever had.
[38:20.630 --> 38:27.630]  Oh, nice. Or, you know, I had pulled my back and I took a bath and the next morning they well, they might still be sore.
[38:27.630 --> 38:34.630]  They were able to at least function or get to work still or get to the doctor without having to call a friend.
[38:35.630 --> 38:49.630]  So, you know, I believe in my opinion that it helps people with especially out here in Colorado, dry skin, psoriasis, things like that, that, you know, are topical issues.
[38:49.630 --> 38:57.630]  Just like any topical, it's being absorbed through your skin. So they do hydrate your skin. You feel very soft when you get out of the tub.
[38:57.630 --> 39:07.630]  Yeah, there's oils in there, essential, like not just essential oils as far as scents, but there's like MCT oil and coconut oil and almond oils.
[39:07.630 --> 39:13.630]  Actually, there's not coconut, there is sweet almond oils sometimes used and depending on which flavors and or scents.
[39:13.630 --> 39:14.630]  Scents.
[39:14.630 --> 39:26.630]  I always say flavors. So, but, so all those things, like they're all made just a little bit different and specifically, but so yeah, I mean, it's just those oils carry the cabinet nodes into the skin.
[39:26.630 --> 39:32.630]  So there's definitely an absorption, but to give you an exact quote on a percentage, I have no scientific facts.
[39:32.630 --> 39:39.630]  Do you think just personally, do you think somebody that did not smoke or consume edibles or anything, would they pass a drug test from using a bath bomb?
[39:39.630 --> 39:44.630]  I don't know, but we could probably find a candidate to test.
[39:44.630 --> 39:49.630]  Do you know somebody that doesn't smoke that you want to drop a bath bomb on? We could talk about that.
[39:49.630 --> 39:50.630]  Yeah, I actually, I...
[39:50.630 --> 39:52.630]  We'll find out if that, what that does.
[39:52.630 --> 40:00.630]  I have some curious friends that are not cannabis consumers that, because again, there's no high to it to me. You're not actually...
[40:00.630 --> 40:06.630]  Is there any THC in it at all from the CBD that your, your skin will absorb?
[40:06.630 --> 40:07.630]  Well, yeah, I mean...
[40:07.630 --> 40:10.630]  We want them to try a THC one to see if they can...
[40:10.630 --> 40:12.630]  Right, yeah, to see if it gets in through the skin.
[40:12.630 --> 40:17.630]  To see, so we need somebody who has, doesn't consume, which so that might be a test that we need to try just to...
[40:17.630 --> 40:18.630]  I'm just curious.
[40:18.630 --> 40:22.630]  Yeah, because I mean, you can buy a test at the grocery store and test them.
[40:22.630 --> 40:24.630]  Yeah, just a little dip pee test.
[40:24.630 --> 40:25.630]  Yeah, because that would be...
[40:25.630 --> 40:28.630]  I don't know anybody that doesn't smoke.
[40:28.630 --> 40:35.630]  I'm trying to think. I do know somebody, but I don't know if they would be down for... I know one person that would be down for it, but I don't...
[40:35.630 --> 40:39.630]  We'll find a test subject sometime soon and I'll report back.
[40:39.630 --> 40:40.630]  There you go. That sounds fun.
[40:40.630 --> 40:43.630]  If you can't find one, let me know because I know one for sure that I can...
[40:43.630 --> 40:44.630]  We'll make it a project.
[40:44.630 --> 40:49.630]  I'm just curious because you said the skin's largest organ. If our lungs take in so much, how much can our skin absorb?
[40:49.630 --> 40:50.630]  It would have to.
[40:50.630 --> 40:53.630]  Yeah, right. Hopefully. Hopefully.
[40:53.630 --> 40:56.630]  We're all just going to be slathered in up with THC creams pretty soon.
[40:56.630 --> 41:01.630]  I mean, because otherwise, to all topicals, I mean, they wouldn't work if our skin wasn't absorbing it.
[41:01.630 --> 41:03.630]  Right, any Arnica gel, anything like that would work.
[41:03.630 --> 41:08.630]  And all those products are excellent sources of pain relief, especially in specific areas.
[41:08.630 --> 41:09.630]  Okay.
[41:09.630 --> 41:12.630]  Do you have a topical? A sap?
[41:12.630 --> 41:17.630]  No, that's out there. I'm not trying to recreate the wheel with this company.
[41:17.630 --> 41:29.630]  Our goal is to find new inventive ways and connoisseur-grade type products, but we're not that much more expensive than the big guys that are doing BHO.
[41:29.630 --> 41:34.630]  So for a few dollars more, you can have something that's completely clean if that's your choice.
[41:34.630 --> 41:38.630]  I personally have smoked BHO. I'm not going to be a snob.
[41:38.630 --> 41:39.630]  We have some here on the table.
[41:39.630 --> 41:40.630]  I mean, it's right here on the table.
[41:40.630 --> 41:41.630]  Yeah, there's plenty here tonight.
[41:41.630 --> 41:47.630]  I'm not sick and I don't have cancer, so I can't make that decision for somebody who might have a more serious condition.
[41:47.630 --> 41:49.630]  For me, it doesn't affect me.
[41:49.630 --> 41:52.630]  So I'm willing to take that risk.
[41:52.630 --> 41:55.630]  Somebody else might not want to have to take that risk.
[41:55.630 --> 41:58.630]  So we want to offer those people a solution.
[41:58.630 --> 42:00.630]  So, sorry, I got off point.
[42:00.630 --> 42:02.630]  No, you're going beautifully. Keep going.
[42:02.630 --> 42:05.630]  Oh, so topicals.
[42:05.630 --> 42:07.630]  So like I said, I'm not trying to recreate it.
[42:07.630 --> 42:10.630]  I do have a topical that I'm wanting to bring out.
[42:10.630 --> 42:15.630]  I'm trying to go, like I said, connoisseur grade, and I'm looking at bringing out a body butter.
[42:15.630 --> 42:16.630]  Cool.
[42:16.630 --> 42:17.630]  You know, dry skin again.
[42:17.630 --> 42:18.630]  Yeah.
[42:18.630 --> 42:20.630]  A big effect out here in the summer.
[42:20.630 --> 42:24.630]  It's sunburns and, you know, there's already the topicals in the South.
[42:24.630 --> 42:28.630]  This will be something that not only nourishes your skin, smells amazing.
[42:28.630 --> 42:33.630]  You know, it's that connoisseur grade body, mall body product.
[42:33.630 --> 42:36.630]  So you can go to the mall, pay the same amount of money.
[42:37.630 --> 42:40.630]  Or you can pay the same amount of money and you can get it with cannabis in it.
[42:40.630 --> 42:47.630]  And it still equally has all those effects, but you will get additional effects if you have a need for that.
[42:47.630 --> 42:48.630]  That's awesome.
[42:48.630 --> 42:49.630]  You can smell like strawberries and watermelons.
[42:49.630 --> 42:51.630]  And have THC all at the same time.
[42:51.630 --> 42:52.630]  That's excellent. I like that.
[42:52.630 --> 42:55.630]  So that's one of the things that I'm working on.
[42:55.630 --> 42:59.630]  What type of price point do the suppositories go for if somebody wants to think about doing this?
[42:59.630 --> 43:00.630]  I know you're not the dispensary.
[43:00.630 --> 43:03.630]  I know you're the distributor and the maker, so you don't set the price, but.
[43:04.630 --> 43:08.630]  The retail price runs, I want to say, right around $16.
[43:08.630 --> 43:09.630]  Oh, that's very affordable.
[43:09.630 --> 43:11.630]  Especially for 50-50 milligram.
[43:11.630 --> 43:12.630]  Okay, yeah.
[43:12.630 --> 43:14.630]  For 12 hours of Medicaid.
[43:14.630 --> 43:15.630]  Right.
[43:15.630 --> 43:16.630]  Yeah, exactly.
[43:16.630 --> 43:20.630]  And it's all about what kind of, what do you need the medicine for?
[43:20.630 --> 43:26.630]  Like, you know, for somebody who doesn't have pain, buying a topical is, you know, doesn't have sore muscles or a joint ache.
[43:26.630 --> 43:28.630]  Why would you buy a topical that's a South?
[43:28.630 --> 43:35.630]  So it's all about application and what you need it for, in my personal opinion, is where you're willing to spend your money.
[43:35.630 --> 43:40.630]  Do you know of dispensaries in the Colorado Springs, Denver area where people can grab these?
[43:40.630 --> 43:41.630]  Absolutely.
[43:41.630 --> 43:43.630]  We have a list of dispensaries.
[43:43.630 --> 43:44.630]  Yeah, I like it.
[43:44.630 --> 43:45.630]  People become prepared.
[43:45.630 --> 43:46.630]  Oh, yeah.
[43:46.630 --> 43:48.630]  I'm prepared, but not overly prepared.
[43:48.630 --> 43:50.630]  So give me two seconds to pull that.
[43:50.630 --> 43:51.630]  Perfect for this show.
[43:51.630 --> 43:56.630]  But I will say, we're going to shout out one of our favorite dispensaries, Epic Remedy.
[43:56.630 --> 43:57.630]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[43:57.630 --> 44:04.630]  I actually just swung through there right before we did the podcast and I picked up a whole bunch of dabble products from them.
[44:04.630 --> 44:06.630]  We grabbed, it was so funny.
[44:06.630 --> 44:15.630]  We went in there earlier this morning and we walked in and shout out to Dusty in there because Dusty was like, drop happening later, come back.
[44:15.630 --> 44:16.630]  And I was like, cool.
[44:16.630 --> 44:23.630]  So I just picked up a syringe and I think I grabbed like a, oh, I grabbed a New York City diesel shatter from them.
[44:24.630 --> 44:27.630]  It looked pretty good in the container, which is why I scooped it.
[44:27.630 --> 44:31.630]  But man, when you open it, that's it right there.
[44:31.630 --> 44:36.630]  It looked honestly like I would compare it to a very well known.
[44:36.630 --> 44:38.630]  And this is dabble?
[44:38.630 --> 44:39.630]  No, yes.
[44:39.630 --> 44:41.630]  No, this is craft actually.
[44:41.630 --> 44:43.630]  And I would compare that to.
[44:43.630 --> 44:46.630]  Oh, that looks like that one real expensive extract.
[44:46.630 --> 44:47.630]  And that's what I was just going to say to you.
[44:47.630 --> 44:49.630]  So I'm going to pass this around so everybody can try this.
[44:49.630 --> 44:50.630]  The one that comes in the brown parchment paper.
[44:50.630 --> 44:52.630]  Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[44:52.630 --> 44:54.630]  That's the first thing I said when it came out.
[44:54.630 --> 44:56.630]  I said, oh, and it tastes so good.
[44:56.630 --> 44:59.630]  Yeah, they carry a lot of, they carry a lot of great concentrates.
[44:59.630 --> 45:00.630]  So yes, big shout out to Epic Remedy.
[45:00.630 --> 45:02.630]  Dusty and everybody in there always hooks us up.
[45:02.630 --> 45:04.630]  Big shout out to them.
[45:04.630 --> 45:06.630]  I've been dabbing these distillate syringes.
[45:06.630 --> 45:08.630]  And their prices are very, very reasonable.
[45:08.630 --> 45:09.630]  Those are amazing too.
[45:09.630 --> 45:11.630]  They have a deal going every day.
[45:11.630 --> 45:18.630]  Another product that we are shortly coming out with, we've got a solvent less edibles, but we're also, the pen market is huge.
[45:19.630 --> 45:21.630]  The, you know, the vape pens.
[45:21.630 --> 45:23.630]  So we're going to have a solvent less pen out soon.
[45:23.630 --> 45:25.630]  Oh, that'll be cool.
[45:25.630 --> 45:27.630]  That, you know, will be available in our areas.
[45:27.630 --> 45:30.630]  So you wanted to know where we are in the Springs area.
[45:30.630 --> 45:36.630]  And again, so what I want to disclose before I give you this list is not everybody carries all of our products.
[45:36.630 --> 45:42.630]  So you're going to want to contact if that's your suspensory and ask them, hey, do you have their rosin or their suppositories?
[45:42.630 --> 45:46.630]  Because some of them carry some of it, but not all of our products.
[45:46.630 --> 45:47.630]  Right.
[45:47.630 --> 45:48.630]  And by the time this comes out, that may have changed.
[45:48.630 --> 45:49.630]  This will be out Monday.
[45:49.630 --> 45:50.630]  So you've got a couple of days.
[45:50.630 --> 45:51.630]  Right.
[45:51.630 --> 46:02.630]  So AIM Wellness here in the Colorado or in the Springs area, the 64 store, Cannabicare, Tweedleaf and Grant Farms.
[46:02.630 --> 46:04.630]  Stained Glass is a huge supporter.
[46:04.630 --> 46:06.630]  I really like working with them.
[46:06.630 --> 46:12.630]  Mindful, Elevations, obviously Epic Remedy we already talked about, Enlightened Care.
[46:13.630 --> 46:17.630]  And I think that's Green Meds, is it?
[46:17.630 --> 46:18.630]  Just the Green Cross.
[46:18.630 --> 46:19.630]  I don't remember what.
[46:19.630 --> 46:21.630]  I think it is Green Meds.
[46:21.630 --> 46:22.630]  Green Meds.
[46:22.630 --> 46:28.630]  And then we do have one partner that we're working with up in Fort Collins and they are just doing amazing things up there.
[46:28.630 --> 46:30.630]  And that's Natural Alternatives.
[46:30.630 --> 46:37.630]  In the Denver area, we've got Live Green, which is Patient's Choice on Colfax.
[46:37.630 --> 46:40.630]  Affinity is on Colfax.
[46:40.630 --> 46:44.630]  Be Good carries our stuff up in North Glen.
[46:44.630 --> 46:49.630]  Greenfields is another one and their sister store.
[46:49.630 --> 46:50.630]  Oh, gosh, what is it?
[46:50.630 --> 46:53.630]  Green.
[46:53.630 --> 46:54.630]  Anyway, they have two stores.
[46:54.630 --> 46:56.630]  There's one in Denver and one up north.
[46:56.630 --> 47:01.630]  People in other states are probably punching something going, they have all these places to go buy weed.
[47:01.630 --> 47:02.630]  Right.
[47:02.630 --> 47:03.630]  What's up, Bob?
[47:03.630 --> 47:04.630]  That's just in the Springs.
[47:04.630 --> 47:07.630]  Little Brown House in Denver.
[47:07.630 --> 47:10.630]  Lotus Medical has us downtown.
[47:10.630 --> 47:16.630]  Lush, Standing Akimbo, The Giving Tree and Kind Love is currently.
[47:16.630 --> 47:17.630]  Kind Love.
[47:17.630 --> 47:19.630]  Ooh, I like Kind Love.
[47:19.630 --> 47:20.630]  It's one of my favorite dispensaries.
[47:20.630 --> 47:21.630]  They don't pay me to say that.
[47:21.630 --> 47:22.630]  Nobody's enticed me to do that.
[47:22.630 --> 47:24.630]  I love the way they're set up.
[47:24.630 --> 47:25.630]  I love the way they handle business.
[47:25.630 --> 47:26.630]  I like the people.
[47:26.630 --> 47:27.630]  Yep, everything.
[47:27.630 --> 47:30.630]  The grow, the medicine, the people, the quality, the products.
[47:30.630 --> 47:31.630]  Kind Love is a nice dispensary.
[47:31.630 --> 47:32.630]  And they carry suppositories there.
[47:32.630 --> 47:34.630]  Yes, they have suppositories.
[47:34.630 --> 47:37.630]  Bath bombs right now is what they're carrying with us.
[47:37.630 --> 47:40.630]  And sometimes they've got the best clones I've ever seen available in a dispensary.
[47:40.630 --> 47:41.630]  Really?
[47:41.630 --> 47:42.630]  At Kind Love.
[47:42.630 --> 47:44.630]  We actually got some of our original clones for our grow from them.
[47:44.630 --> 47:45.630]  Cool.
[47:45.630 --> 47:48.630]  So yeah, we worked with them when we first were getting established back last year.
[47:48.630 --> 47:49.630]  Very neat.
[47:49.630 --> 47:52.630]  Shannon has been working hard on her grow for her company.
[47:52.630 --> 47:53.630]  They grow some Lemon Jeffrey at Kind Love.
[47:53.630 --> 47:54.630]  Do they?
[47:54.630 --> 47:55.630]  They do a really good job.
[47:55.630 --> 47:56.630]  Really good job.
[47:56.630 --> 47:58.630]  Yeah, we've got a great team.
[47:58.630 --> 48:01.630]  We're still a small company, but we've got a great chain.
[48:01.630 --> 48:04.630]  Brent, our grower, does a great job in the back.
[48:04.630 --> 48:10.630]  Our two owners, majority owners, are really just doing a great job running the company.
[48:10.630 --> 48:16.630]  And I'm just happy to be part of all of it and be able to meet people like you guys.
[48:16.630 --> 48:18.630]  We're glad to have you on to teach people about suppositories.
[48:18.630 --> 48:21.630]  Do you have a Pueblo place where people can buy it by any chance?
[48:21.630 --> 48:23.630]  We do not yet.
[48:23.630 --> 48:28.630]  But please, if you're in the Pueblo area and you have a dispensary that wants our product, go in and ask for it.
[48:28.630 --> 48:30.630]  I will make it happen.
[48:31.630 --> 48:36.630]  I need you guys to ask for our products and that will help me.
[48:36.630 --> 48:38.630]  Is it medical only or rec too?
[48:38.630 --> 48:42.630]  We just went rec not too long ago.
[48:42.630 --> 48:50.630]  But on the rec side, we're limited because our grow is not quite established yet on the rec side for that first harvest.
[48:50.630 --> 48:55.630]  So we're only working on ancillary products being bath bombs and suppositories can be made.
[48:56.630 --> 49:01.630]  If anybody needs them on the rec side too, of course, I'm happy to fulfill those needs too.
[49:01.630 --> 49:03.630]  Start making the requests you guys.
[49:03.630 --> 49:05.630]  Start asking your dispensary owners.
[49:05.630 --> 49:07.630]  If you go to the dispensary and they don't have it, ask for it.
[49:07.630 --> 49:15.630]  And on Traveling Stoner and Dabbing Granny, and I'm not popular, but on my Instagram as well,
[49:16.630 --> 49:24.630]  there is a list of all these dispensaries that you can find that they've shouted out for me and been so helpful to help promote for me.
[49:24.630 --> 49:25.630]  Excellent.
[49:25.630 --> 49:28.630]  Shannon, you are one of the cool kids.
[49:28.630 --> 49:32.630]  Hey, I'm cool with not being the cool kid.
[49:32.630 --> 49:34.630]  I just like to hang out with y'all.
[49:34.630 --> 49:35.630]  Instagram doesn't make you famous.
[49:35.630 --> 49:36.630]  No, it doesn't.
[49:36.630 --> 49:39.630]  You brought great content, so we appreciate it.
[49:39.630 --> 49:44.630]  I know everyone's already following the Traveling Stoner and the Dabbing Granny, but if you're not, go follow them.
[49:44.630 --> 49:45.630]  Find those list of dispensaries.
[49:45.630 --> 49:53.630]  There are recreational dispensaries on the list, so if you're coming from out of state, if you're coming from another country, if you're 21 and over, you can get these products.
[49:53.630 --> 49:54.630]  You can take a bath.
[49:54.630 --> 49:56.630]  You can drop a bath bomb in there.
[49:56.630 --> 49:57.630]  You can get a suppository.
[49:57.630 --> 49:59.630]  You can put that where the sun don't shine.
[49:59.630 --> 50:00.630]  You can see what we're talking about.
[50:00.630 --> 50:02.630]  I endorse these products.
[50:02.630 --> 50:11.630]  If you need to tell your dispensary who to contact, my Instagram name is sserendipity93.
[50:12.630 --> 50:17.630]  It says that I'm the CGC manager on there, marketing manager and whatnot.
[50:17.630 --> 50:23.630]  If they can DM me, they can Instagram me, they can call me directly, whatever they need.
[50:23.630 --> 50:26.630]  I'm definitely accessible if they have questions.
[50:26.630 --> 50:27.630]  Get in touch.
[50:27.630 --> 50:30.630]  If you guys heard that hissing sound, that is not a deadly cobra.
[50:30.630 --> 50:34.630]  That is a can of butane refilling a torch because Bobo over here needs a dab.
[50:34.630 --> 50:36.630]  I think he just gave Lindsay a dab of death.
[50:36.630 --> 50:39.630]  I had to take a macro of it because he just gave me the most...
[50:39.630 --> 50:40.630]  Is it a turptail?
[50:41.630 --> 50:46.630]  He put a piece of shatter, then he dipped it in the CBD, and then he just coated it in distillate.
[50:46.630 --> 50:49.630]  I'm watching him, and I'm like, is he going to stop putting distillate on it?
[50:49.630 --> 50:51.630]  Is he going to stop putting distillate?
[50:51.630 --> 50:53.630]  He's not going to stop putting anything.
[50:53.630 --> 50:57.630]  It was the spider web of all the CBD I sent on there.
[50:57.630 --> 50:58.630]  It was falling off, and I didn't want to fall off.
[50:58.630 --> 50:59.630]  You're missing the nail, brother man.
[50:59.630 --> 51:00.630]  There you go.
[51:01.630 --> 51:02.630]  He's trying to get on.
[51:02.630 --> 51:03.630]  Watch my dreads.
[51:03.630 --> 51:04.630]  He's eating nothing.
[51:04.630 --> 51:05.630]  Yeah, that's all I'm worried about.
[51:05.630 --> 51:07.630]  Three people in the room with dreads in.
[51:07.630 --> 51:09.630]  Guys, if you could see this table,
[51:09.630 --> 51:14.630]  I'm sitting here looking, and I forget that this isn't the norm.
[51:14.630 --> 51:17.630]  Oh, if this was Texas, we'd all go to prison for life for what's on this table.
[51:17.630 --> 51:22.630]  We have probably, I don't know, probably 10 tubes of distillate out there.
[51:22.630 --> 51:26.630]  Yeah, there's two, four, six, seven, eight, nine.
[51:26.630 --> 51:28.630]  There are 10 tubes of distillate within my site.
[51:28.630 --> 51:30.630]  Yeah, there's two more over here.
[51:30.630 --> 51:31.630]  Probably another 10 containers of turps.
[51:31.630 --> 51:32.630]  Shatters.
[51:32.630 --> 51:33.630]  There's another shatter.
[51:33.630 --> 51:35.630]  There's two ounces of shatter in front of me.
[51:36.630 --> 51:43.630]  There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven rigs on the table, an e-nail.
[51:43.630 --> 51:45.630]  And this is just how we roll.
[51:45.630 --> 51:46.630]  I can't get it out.
[51:46.630 --> 51:50.630]  This is how, here, Shannon, stick it inside of here so it heats up.
[51:50.630 --> 51:52.630]  There's unheated, unopened distillate.
[51:52.630 --> 51:53.630]  This is ridiculous.
[51:53.630 --> 51:55.630]  Yeah, most people would be mad at us for this.
[51:55.630 --> 51:58.630]  Yeah, what other states would we go to prison for?
[51:58.630 --> 51:59.630]  Kentucky, Texas.
[51:59.630 --> 52:02.630]  They'd come in the front door and just take us to jail forever.
[52:02.630 --> 52:03.630]  Florida.
[52:03.630 --> 52:04.630]  Florida, yeah.
[52:04.630 --> 52:05.630]  Still, yep.
[52:05.630 --> 52:08.630]  So, Granny, a minute ago, you started to hint to us.
[52:08.630 --> 52:09.630]  I can't even talk.
[52:09.630 --> 52:10.630]  I'm still so high.
[52:10.630 --> 52:11.630]  Shout out to the Debs.
[52:11.630 --> 52:14.630]  But anyway, I'm going to get you talking about your Vegas trip, and I'm going to take a Deb.
[52:14.630 --> 52:15.630]  Okay.
[52:15.630 --> 52:18.630]  Who has invited you and the grumpy grandpa to Vegas?
[52:18.630 --> 52:27.630]  This is something I'm very excited about because anybody that follows me on social media knows
[52:27.630 --> 52:33.630]  that my husband is very sick, but he's getting better now that we got him off them damn opioids
[52:33.630 --> 52:34.630]  on cannabis.
[52:34.630 --> 52:41.630]  He's much better, and he's come out of that zombified pharmaceutical trance he was in.
[52:41.630 --> 52:48.630]  And Beta Glass Labs out of Philadelphia called me two weeks ago and said, Granny, you know
[52:48.630 --> 52:49.630]  what Champs is?
[52:49.630 --> 52:50.630]  And I said, I do.
[52:50.630 --> 52:51.630]  I kind of would like to go.
[52:51.630 --> 52:56.630]  And they said, well, we'll fly you and grumpy grandpa out there together.
[52:56.630 --> 52:58.630]  And I'm like, you're kidding me.
[52:58.630 --> 52:59.630]  And they said, nope.
[52:59.630 --> 53:01.630]  We'd like to have the both of you come out.
[53:01.630 --> 53:02.630]  And they said, we'll set you up in a hotel.
[53:02.630 --> 53:06.630]  And I said, well, I've got to talk it over with my husband.
[53:06.630 --> 53:11.630]  So, I hung up and I asked Kevin, and he said, I feel pretty good.
[53:11.630 --> 53:16.630]  Even if I have to stay in my hotel room, I think you and I can take a trip to Vegas.
[53:16.630 --> 53:17.630]  Nice.
[53:17.630 --> 53:18.630]  Very nice.
[53:18.630 --> 53:22.630]  So, shout out to Beta Glass Labs for making this trip come true.
[53:22.630 --> 53:24.630]  You're going to see some great glass.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.630]  And what did you say?
[53:25.630 --> 53:28.630]  It's been like five years since you guys have taken any kind of vacation together?
[53:28.630 --> 53:30.630]  Yeah, because he's been so sick.
[53:30.630 --> 53:31.630]  This is amazing.
[53:31.630 --> 53:32.630]  Perfect timing.
[53:32.630 --> 53:33.630]  It's perfect timing.
[53:33.630 --> 53:35.630]  You've been blessed lately, granny.
[53:35.630 --> 53:37.630]  I've had lots of good things come my way.
[53:37.630 --> 53:39.630]  You've been doing things correctly.
[53:39.630 --> 53:41.630]  I believe you reap what you sow.
[53:41.630 --> 53:43.630]  I'm not out there to make money.
[53:43.630 --> 53:49.630]  I'm out there to, well, I'm out to promote a lot of young artists that I see here in the Springs.
[53:49.630 --> 53:52.630]  I'm out to help educate about cannabis.
[53:52.630 --> 53:54.630]  And I'm out to have fun while I do it.
[53:54.630 --> 53:57.630]  I think you were achieving all three of those goals.
[53:57.630 --> 54:01.630]  This year, things are coming to fruition, though, and that's kind of cool.
[54:01.630 --> 54:03.630]  Like, okay, guys, tonight here we sit.
[54:03.630 --> 54:06.630]  Like I said, we had all those products on the table.
[54:06.630 --> 54:13.630]  Something we didn't say, shout out to Clydeside Edibles from Glasgow, Scotland.
[54:13.630 --> 54:15.630]  All the way from Scotland.
[54:15.630 --> 54:22.630]  I got a care package yesterday of edibles and T-shirts from Glasgow, Scotland.
[54:22.630 --> 54:29.630]  Now, I opened them up, and everybody was like, ooh, I'll tell you what, their edibles are pretty darn good.
[54:29.630 --> 54:31.630]  That chocolate marshmallow thing looked amazing.
[54:31.630 --> 54:34.630]  It looked very dense, but, man, it was amazing.
[54:34.630 --> 54:35.630]  It wasn't heavy.
[54:35.630 --> 54:36.630]  It was good.
[54:36.630 --> 54:38.630]  I'm just glad that it was only THC.
[54:38.630 --> 54:41.630]  We joked about some of this maybe having possible other.
[54:41.630 --> 54:44.630]  I've still got these little, not chocolate, these hard candies.
[54:44.630 --> 54:48.630]  They are pineapple chunks made with sour diesel cannabis.
[54:48.630 --> 54:52.630]  They're 50 milligrams per bag, 2.5 milligrams per cube.
[54:52.630 --> 54:58.630]  The cubes are small, and they remind me of some mescaline I got on fish school one time.
[54:58.630 --> 55:00.630]  So I was very apprehensive to eat these.
[55:00.630 --> 55:02.630]  I did not eat any.
[55:02.630 --> 55:05.630]  All of my friends that did eat them seemed to be okay, so I'm excited.
[55:05.630 --> 55:06.630]  And they taste amazing.
[55:06.630 --> 55:10.630]  They smell good, but those little squares look very suspicious to me.
[55:10.630 --> 55:17.630]  But, I mean, who would even think that you would be eating THC edibles from Scotland?
[55:18.630 --> 55:22.630]  And, you know, I got to say, they have really big balls in Scotland,
[55:22.630 --> 55:27.630]  because not only did they ship this to her, but they had it labeled right in there.
[55:27.630 --> 55:29.630]  Sweets and t-shirts.
[55:29.630 --> 55:31.630]  And what did he say?
[55:31.630 --> 55:38.630]  Okay, so then I said to him, well, I want to know, what does a Scotsman wear under his kilt?
[55:38.630 --> 55:41.630]  And he said, if they're a true Scotsman like me, nothing.
[55:41.630 --> 55:43.630]  It's balls in the wind.
[55:43.630 --> 55:46.630]  So these edibles were made by a dude not wearing any underwear?
[55:46.630 --> 55:48.630]  Oh, God, I hope he wasn't scratching.
[55:48.630 --> 55:50.630]  He had a skirt on.
[55:50.630 --> 55:53.630]  Makes it easier to insert his suppository.
[55:53.630 --> 55:56.630]  We should probably send him back a care package.
[55:56.630 --> 55:59.630]  I am not messing with shipping anything to Scotland.
[55:59.630 --> 56:01.630]  We'll wait a few more years on that one.
[56:01.630 --> 56:02.630]  Yeah, none of us said that either.
[56:02.630 --> 56:05.630]  So not only did I get something from Glasgow, Scotland,
[56:05.630 --> 56:09.630]  I'm going to shout out Long Bong Official.
[56:09.630 --> 56:10.630]  Should I tell the whole world?
[56:10.630 --> 56:11.630]  Is that porn?
[56:11.630 --> 56:13.630]  It sounds like it.
[56:13.630 --> 56:16.630]  Now, these guys have a, it's like a six-foot bong.
[56:16.630 --> 56:17.630]  If you're on Instagram.
[56:17.630 --> 56:19.630]  Oh, yeah, you can tell the whole story too, if you'd like.
[56:19.630 --> 56:20.630]  Can I? Okay.
[56:20.630 --> 56:25.630]  If you're on Instagram, you will see this big six-foot bong.
[56:25.630 --> 56:29.630]  And I will say, it looks kind of appealing.
[56:29.630 --> 56:31.630]  And it's metal and crystal.
[56:31.630 --> 56:34.630]  And it's called Stanley, kind of like Flat Stanley.
[56:34.630 --> 56:39.630]  It's supposed to travel around to different weed people.
[56:40.630 --> 56:44.630]  And I had messaged this company, not knowing anything about him, saying,
[56:44.630 --> 56:47.630]  well, can Stanley come to my house to review?
[56:47.630 --> 56:49.630]  And they said, yes, he could.
[56:49.630 --> 56:54.630]  And then a couple months later, they said, Granny, we can't secure Stanley.
[56:54.630 --> 56:57.630]  I said, what do you mean you can't secure Stanley?
[56:57.630 --> 56:59.630]  And they said, well, we'll get back to you.
[56:59.630 --> 57:06.630]  So a month ago, they say to me, Granny, Custom Grow 420 has Stanley,
[57:06.630 --> 57:08.630]  and he won't respond to us.
[57:08.630 --> 57:10.630]  We will not give Stanley back.
[57:10.630 --> 57:13.630]  So Custom Grow is holding Stanley hostage.
[57:13.630 --> 57:14.630]  He likes Stanley.
[57:14.630 --> 57:16.630]  He's not going to give Stanley back.
[57:16.630 --> 57:20.630]  Well, that probably is no big deal if you're a company here in the United States.
[57:20.630 --> 57:23.630]  I'd just go find Custom Grow 420.
[57:23.630 --> 57:29.630]  These guys are in Slovakia, which is the former Czechoslovakia.
[57:29.630 --> 57:32.630]  So there's no chase in Custom Grow 420?
[57:32.630 --> 57:37.630]  And I told them I can't find Custom Grow 420.
[57:37.630 --> 57:39.630]  But I'll tell everybody this story.
[57:39.630 --> 57:43.630]  We can tell everybody that follows all of us on Twitter and that listen to this podcast
[57:43.630 --> 57:47.630]  to send a message to Custom Grow and be like, return Stanley.
[57:47.630 --> 57:49.630]  So this company was so nice.
[57:49.630 --> 57:56.630]  They sent me their second bong, which is called T-O, T-E-O.
[57:56.630 --> 57:57.630]  It's very big.
[57:57.630 --> 58:03.630]  It is hand-blown Czechoslovakian crystal, Bohemian crystal.
[58:03.630 --> 58:05.630]  How tall would you say it is?
[58:06.630 --> 58:07.630]  From the table?
[58:07.630 --> 58:09.630]  Oh, that's 24 inches tall?
[58:09.630 --> 58:10.630]  Probably.
[58:10.630 --> 58:11.630]  Easily.
[58:11.630 --> 58:12.630]  Easily.
[58:12.630 --> 58:16.630]  Because if I stand up, the mouthpiece is right where I'm standing.
[58:16.630 --> 58:17.630]  And I'm pretty tall, Jeff.
[58:17.630 --> 58:19.630]  Yeah, you are a tall lady.
[58:19.630 --> 58:23.630]  So they sent me this bong, and I really like it.
[58:23.630 --> 58:27.630]  But who's going to get a bong ship from Slovakia?
[58:27.630 --> 58:29.630]  Only Dab and Granny.
[58:29.630 --> 58:30.630]  Only Dab and Granny.
[58:30.630 --> 58:31.630]  Only.
[58:31.630 --> 58:32.630]  So we should...
[58:32.630 --> 58:33.630]  Go ahead.
[58:33.630 --> 58:34.630]  How does that thing hit?
[58:34.630 --> 58:35.630]  I get hella high off that.
[58:35.630 --> 58:37.630]  I've seen the video on Instagram.
[58:37.630 --> 58:39.630]  It's real bubbly.
[58:39.630 --> 58:40.630]  That perk is like...
[58:40.630 --> 58:41.630]  So it's...
[58:41.630 --> 58:43.630]  Describe the shape of it for us.
[58:43.630 --> 58:44.630]  You told us how tall it was.
[58:44.630 --> 58:49.630]  It looks kind of like a big crystal liter, two liter bottle, three liter bottle.
[58:49.630 --> 58:54.630]  And then there's this metal perk, and it's all done on a lathe.
[58:54.630 --> 58:57.630]  They have a video up where you can actually see them making it.
[58:57.630 --> 59:01.630]  Because I know people are like, ooh, I don't want to smoke on a metal.
[59:01.630 --> 59:03.630]  I'm an old hippie.
[59:03.630 --> 59:05.630]  You smoked that way worse.
[59:05.630 --> 59:06.630]  Yeah.
[59:06.630 --> 59:07.630]  And guess what?
[59:07.630 --> 59:08.630]  I still use a Bic lighter.
[59:08.630 --> 59:09.630]  Me too.
[59:09.630 --> 59:10.630]  Not hemp.
[59:10.630 --> 59:11.630]  Me too.
[59:11.630 --> 59:12.630]  Don't bring your hemp wick toward me.
[59:12.630 --> 59:13.630]  I can't get my...
[59:13.630 --> 59:16.630]  You can't get your bowl hot enough to fill your lungs.
[59:16.630 --> 59:19.630]  I've got to light the hemp wick with a lighter, and then light my bowl with the hemp wick,
[59:19.630 --> 59:20.630]  and then shake the hemp wick like a fruit cup.
[59:20.630 --> 59:22.630]  Oh, no, you have to have a candle going.
[59:22.630 --> 59:23.630]  No, no.
[59:23.630 --> 59:24.630]  That's too many damn things.
[59:24.630 --> 59:26.630]  Get a lighter and smoke a bowl.
[59:26.630 --> 59:30.630]  So it's like a three liter bottle with this perk,
[59:30.630 --> 59:35.630]  and then there's this great big tall piece that comes up off the top that you fill with ice.
[59:35.630 --> 59:40.630]  Gives hella rips, but it's not really practical.
[59:40.630 --> 59:44.630]  I mean, it's heavy.
[59:44.630 --> 59:47.630]  So once you put it down somewhere, it should stay there.
[59:47.630 --> 59:48.630]  Ah, okay.
[59:48.630 --> 59:49.630]  It looks really heavy.
[59:49.630 --> 59:50.630]  It's very heavy.
[59:50.630 --> 59:51.630]  It's crystal.
[59:51.630 --> 59:52.630]  I didn't even...
[59:52.630 --> 59:53.630]  It is crystal.
[59:53.630 --> 59:54.630]  Okay.
[59:54.630 --> 59:55.630]  And that crystal is thick.
[59:55.630 --> 59:58.630]  So, I mean, I think it's kind of cool I got a bong from.
[59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.630]  They shipped it to you from Slovakia?
[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.630]  Yes.
[01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:02.630]  That's awesome.
[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:13.630]  And then they thought I spoke Slovakian, because I was trying to be nice, and I Googled simple Slovakian phrases, and I cut and paste, and they replied with a paragraph.
[01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:16.630]  And I was like, oh, no, I don't speak Slovakian.
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.630]  I was just being polite.
[01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.630]  Help.
[01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.630]  Google translator blew up.
[01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.630]  But they're very nice people.
[01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.630]  They really are.
[01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:25.630]  So shout out to long bong official.
[01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.630]  Yes, big shout out.
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:27.630]  That bong is amazing.
[01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:28.630]  I don't say bong very much anymore.
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:30.630]  I know, because we all dab.
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.630]  Yeah, yeah, bong.
[01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.630]  I used to be the bong champ.
[01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.630]  I kind of like smoking out of it.
[01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.630]  I might have to clean my bong and go at it again.
[01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.630]  Actually, maybe the next time we set...
[01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.630]  I'll have to take it apart, but there's screws to take...
[01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.630]  Some assembly is required.
[01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.630]  I'll bring it to Cana Canyon.
[01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.630]  We'll all do a few bong rips.
[01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:48.630]  Sounds fun.
[01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.630]  Sounds fun.
[01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:50.630]  I'm in.
[01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.630]  Can I do a few more shout outs?
[01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:52.630]  Please do.
[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:53.630]  Please do.
[01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:58.630]  I got a really nice giveaway going on with Freaky Smoke Shop here in the Springs.
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:03.630]  I have an e-nail, a rig that Lindsay and I have been smoking out of.
[01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:07.630]  I took a titanium pencil and I signed the bottom.
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:11.630]  It says, Peace, Deb and Granny 2017.
[01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.630]  And there's a few other giveaways...
[01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:15.630]  A few other...
[01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.630]  What do you call them?
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:17.630]  Swag.
[01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.630]  Swag.
[01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:19.630]  Some more swag to give away.
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:20.630]  God dang, I think I'm high.
[01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.630]  I think we all might be medicated properly.
[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.630]  When I can't even think of simple words, it's bad.
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.630]  Or is it?
[01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:30.630]  Anyway, so that is the giveaway.
[01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:36.630]  And then the one thing I want to say is, I reached 250,000 followers on Instagram.
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.630]  I've surpassed that even now.
[01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:41.630]  By the time this comes out, you'll be way past that.
[01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.630]  I'm at 252 or 250.
[01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.630]  But that just amazes me.
[01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:51.630]  So I am going to be doing a hell of an appreciation giveaway.
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:57.630]  One of the things that I know, Beta Glass Labs is going to donate one of their rigs to me.
[01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:06.630]  Then somebody I absolutely adore here in the Springs, Popty Glass, has already blown a piece to give me for the giveaway.
[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:11.630]  I bet I can get a few other nice little glass blowers here in the Springs to give us some nice things.
[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:15.630]  So just be keeping an eye out for my 250 giveaway.
[01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.630]  And then of course I've got to thank my sponsors.
[01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:24.630]  Dabato, Ooz 420, and I'm back to repping Megatoke.
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.630]  And I actually like Smoke and Concentrate out of it.
[01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.630]  Other than that, I'm done shouting out.
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.630]  I want to give a shout out to Elevate.
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.630]  Always Elevate Glass.
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.630]  We all need Elevate Glass.
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.630]  Big shout out to Becca and the whole crew over at Elevate.
[01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.630]  The beautiful ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.630]  But they're all Elevate dolls.
[01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.630]  Those dudes are dolls.
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.630]  I know. I asked them, what do I call you?
[01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.630]  What do I call you?
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.630]  You sound like a doll.
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.630]  What's up, Turtle?
[01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:51.630]  There you go. Own it.
[01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:55.630]  Hey, maybe we should shout out a few companies that we've been getting our CBD from.
[01:02:55.630 --> 01:03:02.630]  Because some of these companies, even you people in states that aren't legal, you can order CBD.
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.630]  And so far they're still delivering.
[01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.630]  I can direct you to EmpireWellness.com.
[01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:14.630]  I think anybody that sampled their CBD tonight or their terps, their terps are wonderful.
[01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.630]  They're good people.
[01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.630]  They've helped me get medicine to patients.
[01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:24.630]  All Dank Distillate Dabs here in Colorado, he is still shipping nationwide.
[01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.630]  Trinity Terpenes, they're still shipping nationwide.
[01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.630]  And PhytoFamily, they're still shipping nationwide.
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.630]  Allegedly.
[01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.630]  Well, they're still shipping to Dab and Granny.
[01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:38.630]  There you go.
[01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.630]  I believe even, oh, and in, uh, John Ramsey.
[01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:44.630]  What's his company?
[01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.630]  Infinite CBD?
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.630]  He's still shipping.
[01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:48.630]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:51.630]  I see those guys talking about it on Facebook and Instagram all the time.
[01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.630]  They want to get CBD out to everybody.
[01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.630]  Shout out to all the CBD warriors.
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:04:00.630]  The one thing I will say is we've got a lot of great CBD manufacturers.
[01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.630]  I don't know, extractors, whatever.
[01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:05.630]  But then we also have a lot of bullshit.
[01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.630]  We have these CBD wars where they're all biting and scratching at each other.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.630]  I won't deal with this.
[01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.630]  I will not endorse just one company.
[01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:14.630]  I will endorse them all.
[01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.630]  Yes.
[01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.630]  Because then they've got to be nice to all our followers.
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.630]  It happens in the seed game also.
[01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:21.630]  Oh, I'm sure, Jeff.
[01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.630]  You can probably speak.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:24.630]  Yeah.
[01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:26.630]  And I, the older I get, the more I'm like, well, this is stupid.
[01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.630]  We're all doing the same thing.
[01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.630]  Let's just chill out and be nice to each other and do the, there's room for all of us.
[01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:34.630]  There shouldn't be a competition.
[01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:36.630]  There's a consumer for every product that's made.
[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:42.630]  There's enough of us patients and consumers out there that none of you are going to go out of business.
[01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:43.630]  Right. Absolutely.
[01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.630]  I can smoke all of this hash on this table.
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.630]  Guaranteed.
[01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:47.630]  I need a provider for more.
[01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:48.630]  Yep.
[01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.630]  Lindsay, you doubt me?
[01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:50.630]  Nope.
[01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:54.630]  I'm laughing because Bobo just tried to smell a glass syringe like in the middle of it.
[01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.630]  Does it have any smell, bro?
[01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:58.630]  No.
[01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:59.630]  No?
[01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:00.630]  Not at all.
[01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.630]  All right.
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:02.630]  That's what I was just.
[01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:03.630]  Have you tried that one yet?
[01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:04.630]  No.
[01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:05.630]  Please do.
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.630]  I was just going to ask you, whose is this?
[01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.630]  It's mine.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:14.540]  Some of these companies and their packaging are just amazing.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.540]  This package is, what else comes in a package this size?
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.540]  Like toothpaste almost.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.540]  Yes.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:27.540]  And the product that comes in it is, I'm trying to find something.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.540]  What else is this?
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.540]  Nothing else is this size.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:30.540]  Nothing else is this small.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.540]  No, and then they have to put it in that plastic as well.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.540]  Okay.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.540]  So we put it in this box with everything printed on it.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.540]  And then we put it in.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.540]  This syringe is a little bigger.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.540]  Probably like a cartridge.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.540]  Oh, that's a bigger syringe.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.540]  Okay.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]  That's better.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.540]  All right.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.540]  That makes more sense.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]  But still, couldn't the labeling go on?
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.540]  Go on to here, but then it wouldn't be consumer friendly.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:53.540]  So the packaging, oh my, so much packaging in Colorado, you guys.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540]  It's garbage is what I call it.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.540]  This is all landfill material unless you recycle.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.540]  And I know a lot of people that should that don't.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.540]  My neighborhood doesn't support much recycling.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.540]  And you know what?
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.540]  If your trash company isn't going to help you, it's hard to recycle.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.540]  Let's admit it.
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.540]  I know you compost, don't you?
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.540]  I do what I can, but I can't compost everything.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.540]  I don't have enough space and some stuff stinks.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.540]  It stinks and you don't want that in your home.
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.540]  Yes, but you can't smell it, can you?
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.540]  Nope.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.540]  Nope.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.540]  When you talked about, actually, when you talked on one of your podcasts about some of the things and I was like, oh,
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.540]  his house smelled like a home, not like a excellent nail in it.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.540]  Thank you.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.540]  Cause I've got caught.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.540]  My Bokashi bucket is right over there.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:39.540]  I was just going to say that Bokashi bucket and sometimes that sucker can stay.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.540]  Yeah.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.540]  Yeah.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.540]  But you don't smell it at all.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.540]  Jeff's home is very pleasant.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.540]  Oh, well, it looks like it's a dude's house.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.540]  It could use a, it could use a cleaning, but you have a pink bathroom.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.540]  Oh, back to the pink bathroom.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.540]  I want to give a shout out to all my triplet friends in here.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.540]  Everybody's wearing their growth from your heart podcast hoodie and looking super sexy.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540]  Big shout out to my friends at handmade apparel.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.540]  Yes, I know I'm supposed to do an ad for handmade apparel.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:02.540]  If you guys need some printing done, I might have to hit him up.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.540]  You please do.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.540]  Please use me as a reference.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.540]  I will.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.540]  About both of us.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:12.540]  If you need hoodies, t-shirts, if you need happens, if you need stickers, you need some stuff printed and you want it to look sharp.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.540]  How dope are the colors on those hoodies?
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.540]  You guys are vivid.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.540]  They're bright.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.540]  They look.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.540]  Have you guys washed yours?
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540]  I have washed mine twice now.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540]  Me too.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.540]  And they still look brand new.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.540]  They actually look sweet.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.540]  No cracks in the back or anything.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.540]  No issues.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.540]  But do you do, are you, are you friendly to your hoodie?
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.540]  Do you turn it inside out?
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.540]  No, I didn't.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.540]  You should turn it inside out when you wash it.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.540]  It'll last even longer.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540]  Then it won't crack.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.540]  The stuff won't crack.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.540]  Because then your logo is not beating on the parts of the washer.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.540]  Okay, that makes sense.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.540]  And the dryer's not heating up.
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.540]  You know, a logo.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.540]  Yeah.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.540]  And like making it stick together.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.540]  Life hack.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.540]  Teaching people.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.540]  That's what happens when you're 60, not 25.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.540]  Right.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540]  Hey, I'm getting, getting up there.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.540]  You're starting to learn all them little things.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.540]  This is one of the original iRegenetic shirts.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.540]  The very first batch printed by Handmade.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.540]  And it's probably, I'm going to guess this is seven years old.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.540]  Wow.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.540]  And it's just now starting to kind of, starting at the edges to look weird.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.540]  Like it's crackling.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.540]  But look at the shirt.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.540]  It's like not even black anymore.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.540]  It's all dingy.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.540]  It's basically a work shirt.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.540]  It's like one of your favorite concert t-shirts.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.540]  Yes, yes.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.540]  But I've got, I bought a lot of these shirts.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.540]  And I think most of the extra, extra larges went to me.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.540]  I think.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.540]  If there's a festival, excuse me for the cough, guys.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:28.540]  If there's a festival, if there's an event, brand new iRe shirt.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.540]  Just got to rock the brand new one.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.540]  Then I try to set it aside, then I forget and I end up wearing it.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.540]  And then I'm like, oh, there's another event.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.540]  Brand new iRe shirt.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540]  Got to do it again.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.540]  So.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.540]  You guys really should order one of your girl from your heart.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.540]  These are nice hoodies.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540]  These are really, and they're really warm.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.540]  They're warm.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.540]  I don't have a coat on tonight.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.540]  I have a little camisole underneath it.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.540]  Chris and I went camping for my birthday.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.540]  We went January 2nd.
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.540]  We got in the car and we went camping.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.540]  And it was snowing.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.540]  It was snowing.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.540]  It was 20 degrees that night.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:09:02.540]  And I, I wore the girl from your heart podcast sweatshirt all night with like,
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.540]  probably like two layers underneath it.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.540]  And that was it.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.540]  And I was so warm all night.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.540]  Like I was not, I didn't have any issues.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.540]  Super cozy hoodies.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.540]  So that's a double advertisement right there.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.540]  You guys shout out to our friends at handmade apparel.

[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540]  I'd love to put one of these hoodies in your hands.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.540]  You'd look sexy in it.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.540]  He looks so good.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.540]  All your friends will be like, what's that?
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.540]  Grow from your heart.
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540]  And then you'll be like, yeah, it's a podcast, bro.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.540]  We do.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.540]  We tell everybody that when we go places.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.540]  I've secretly gotten asked multiple times what this hoodie is.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.540]  On multiple occasions.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.540]  That's pretty rad.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.540]  And we tell people.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.540]  Thank you.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.540]  But the back is the best because you got Rasta Jeff's cheesy face.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.540]  It's so cheesy.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.540]  It is super cheesy.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.540]  It just makes you smile.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:54.540]  Sometimes, you know, I have to go in the bathroom, just turn around, put my camera.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.540]  That's funny.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540]  That's awkward.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.540]  I like it.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:59.540]  I like it.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540]  They gave me a really friendly deal because of what it was.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.540]  They're like, dude, we want to do this.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540]  We want to do this.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.540]  And I was like, go for it.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.540]  Like, there's a lot of color in this.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.540]  That's like nine colors.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.540]  Yeah.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.540]  So shout out to our friends at handmade apparel.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.540]  Since we talked about all the other companies that we were supporting.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.540]  Lindsay, don't you have a few new sponsors?
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.540]  Nothing you want to talk about right now.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.540]  Well, I mean, I can let you guys know that my website will be up and running at the end of the month.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.540]  So the blog portion of my website will at least be up and running at the end of the month.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540]  The end of which month?
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.540]  This month.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.540]  Didn't we hear that the last podcast?
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.540]  That's why I wanted to specify.
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.540]  When was I here the last time?
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.540]  It was before the food thing.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.540]  That's funny.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.540]  Well, I've actually been working really hard on it, and it will be out at the end of this month.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.540]  Because I have nothing else that I am working on right now.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.540]  This is the only thing I've been working on.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.540]  So it will definitely be out at the end of this month.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]  The only reason I troll you is because I like the shit.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.540]  No, I know.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.540]  But that's funny because I didn't realize I had said that at the end of the last one.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.540]  That's funny.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.540]  Chris is nodding yes.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.540]  He saw me setting it up.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.540]  I was setting it up.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.540]  And I was fighting that shit.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.540]  Chris was like, oh, let me do it.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.540]  Let me do it.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.540]  So since Granny reminded me, and it was in my notes.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.540]  I didn't even open my notebook because we had so much to talk about on the show.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.540]  It stayed on the floor.
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:13.540]  It was all organic and natural.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.540]  How was the food drive, you guys?
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540]  How did that go?
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.540]  Do you know, I actually, the day that they picked everything up, I was at my sister's wedding in Georgia.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:27.540]  So shout out to Granny and Sam and Bailey and everybody else that came out and helped.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.540]  That was it.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:32.540]  Sam, Bailey, and I, and then the people at the Marian House.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:39.540]  But when we pulled up in that new hall, and those people were on the dock, and I opened it up and she went.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:48.540]  And I got out of the truck and I came up and I said, I wasn't going to tell you until I got here, but this all came from the cannabis community.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:52.540]  And she goes, where did you get all this food?
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.540]  And I said, all the food.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.540]  And there's toys in there.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.540]  There's money in there.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.540]  And it all came from dispensaries.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.540]  I'm getting, my hair is standing up.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.540]  Yeah, I can see it in your face.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.540]  It made me so happy.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.540]  And she was like, wow, you guys really made a difference.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:16.540]  So we had a U-Haul truck from ceiling to floor, front to back that was full of food, toys.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:21.540]  There was some brand new kids' hats, gloves, lots of new toys for the kids.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]  Good stuff.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.540]  That's awesome.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.540]  Yes.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.540]  And then when I spoke with the lady, I was so impressed with this program.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.540]  And it's all through the Marian House Catholic Charities.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.540]  If you're not religious, I don't care.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.540]  Still getting people warm and fed and toys in kids' hands.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:38.540]  They had, do you know what I mean by gorilla shelves, those metal shelves?
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:41.540]  They had several of those different categories.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:47.540]  And they have a lot of displaced families that are trying to get back on track.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.540]  The parents have to take parenting classes, which I think that's good.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.540]  That's good because if you're young, you know, I was young and dumb once too.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.540]  You need help.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.540]  And we get a lot of people coming here because of the cannabis community and they don't have a plan.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540]  They don't have a solid plan in place.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540]  And sometimes kids suffer.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:08.540]  Anyway, these gorilla shelves have brand new toys.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:12.540]  And if it's a kid's birthday, they get to come in and they get to pick a brand new toy.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540]  They had so many brand new diapers.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:21.540]  You can go down there and get, if you need diapers, people, you can go down to the Marian House and get diapers.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.540]  There's no questions asked.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.540]  Diapers are expensive.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.540]  So I just felt, yes, we did make a big difference.
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.540]  Thank you for bringing that up because that seems like an eternity ago.
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.540]  It was a while ago, but thank you for doing it because of the smile on your face right now.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:36.540]  It's priceless.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]  Was it?
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.540]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.540]  It made me really happy to know that we helped so many people.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.540]  I can only imagine the looks on the little kids' faces when they, because they know, the little kids know, like, we're fucked, we didn't get nothing.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.540]  They know.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]  They can see it.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.540]  Their parents don't tell them, but they know.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.540]  We live in a thing and we aren't getting stuff.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.540]  It's not going to be cool.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.540]  And then they get a present.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.540]  You know it.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.540]  And they're like, oh my God, I got a $5 dinosaur that made my day, you know, like this.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.540]  And kids, you know, kids shouldn't have to be punished for decisions their parents make.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540]  Right.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540]  I agree.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]  So thank you for doing that.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.540]  And Lindsay, thank you.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.540]  I know you weren't there on the day, but you had a lot to do with it.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.540]  For sure.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.540]  I want to give a big shout out to Bailey too for being a part of it.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.540]  And actually I put up that post tonight that we were doing the podcast and she commented
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540]  on it.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540]  She's like, yes, I've been looking for the name of it.
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540]  Like, yes.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.540]  So big shout out to Bailey.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.540]  Rocky Mountain Dabber.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.540]  Yes.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.540]  Oh, I met her at the Halloween party.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.540]  Yes.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.540]  I wasn't super talkative at the Halloween party because I was in the Chewbacca costume.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.540]  And I kind of overheated myself.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.540]  I was dehydrated and spinning around in circles for part of it.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:37.540]  But yes, big shout out to Bailey because she got up and helped Granny and Sam without any
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.540]  questions asked on her day off.
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.540]  And it was cold that day.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:46.540]  And you know, she's a bud tender at Rocky Mountain Medical over on Garden of the Gods.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:51.540]  And you know, she probably only gets a couple days a week off and I'm sure she didn't have...
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.540]  Plus she has a debilitating...
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:59.540]  Yeah, she has a lot of medical conditions that, you know, make it hard for her to stay mobile sometimes.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.540]  The last time they sent her home from the hospital with a walker.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.540]  Yeah.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.540]  And she's what, 20?
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540]  She's about my age, yeah.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.540]  She's a youngster, yeah.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.540]  So big shout out to Bailey for, you know...
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.540]  We love you, Bailey.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540]  You're a trooper.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.540]  Also big shout out to THC Samuel.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.540]  Yes, for helping with that as well.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.540]  Also just for being THC Samuel.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540]  Shout out to that dude.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.540]  Sam has a lot to talk about.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.540]  Sam was just out on the West Coast.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.540]  Started down in San Francisco with JD Mapleson.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540]  These are all heady glassblowers guys.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:31.540]  Started down in San Francisco, worked his way up, spent the night with Darby Holmes and the Holmes family.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.540]  And ended his trip with Bob Snodgrass.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.540]  85 year old legend in the glassblowing world.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.540]  The legend.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.540]  In the school bus.
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.540]  I mean it.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.540]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.540]  Sam has a lot to talk about from this last trip.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.540]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]  We're going to get Samuel on the show.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540]  And he's the perfect person for that.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.540]  Like, he just...
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.540]  I love him.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:59.540]  Now, when I say these are heady glassblowers, I don't know if any of us sitting here can probably afford any of these pieces.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.540]  And I love you Sam.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.540]  When Sam texted me that he was at Darby Holmes and we...
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.540]  Sam and I have come to know the Holmes family.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.540]  And he said, all I could afford was a carb cap.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.540]  And the carb cap is beautiful.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.540]  It's so gorgeous.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:19.540]  But I'm telling you guys, that wasn't like a $5, $10, $20, $30, $100.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540]  No.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.540]  It's a beautiful dichro.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540]  It's peach, right?
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.540]  Yes.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.540]  That's what it's peach.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.540]  And then it has these two green leaves on it.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.540]  It is a gorgeous carb cap.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.540]  And it's a directional flow.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.540]  Like, it is a truly, solidly gorgeous piece.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.540]  But these glassblowers.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.540]  Yeah.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540]  Yeah.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.540]  Some of them pieces are a house.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.540]  I was going to say, that's a car sitting on the shelf right there.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.540]  Absolutely.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.540]  Well, shout out to THC, Sam.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.540]  We're going to get him on the show.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.540]  Sam and I both have been survivors of head injuries.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.540]  And Sam, of course, has had a couple more than me.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.540]  I've got one major one and one when I was a youth.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.540]  But we're going to talk about head injuries.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.540]  And we're going to talk about heady glass.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540]  So, we'll get Sam on the show.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.540]  We're also going to talk about the East Coast, because he's from the East Coast.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.540]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.540]  I'm going to ask him some weed questions about the East Coast and see what he's got to say.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]  So, big shout out to Sam.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.540]  Shout out to everybody that helped in the food drive.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.540]  Shout out to every dispensary that allowed.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:14.540]  Excuse me.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.540]  My throat is wrecked, you guys.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.540]  I apologize.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.540]  Give me one good one.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.540]  I should say that it wasn't just dispensaries that did this just before you started.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.540]  Because, like, the Cana Canyon was a part of it.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.540]  Okay.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.540]  The Family Joint.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.540]  The Family Joint was.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.540]  The Lazy Lion.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.540]  The Lazy Lion.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.540]  The Dab Lounge.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.540]  Yep.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.540]  All right.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540]  Elevate Glass.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.540]  Yeah, Elevate.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.540]  The Glass Grind.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.540]  Yes.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.540]  DBK Glass.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.540]  Is that what it is?
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.540]  Mary and Dylan.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.540]  Is it DBK Glass?
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.540]  I have a whole list of them on my phone, to be honest with you.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:50.540]  Shout out to everybody that let us have a drop-off spot, a box, and everybody that brought stuff to the boxes.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.540]  Yes.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.540]  Yes.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:53.540]  You know what?
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.540]  Shout out to all those folks.
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.540]  I'm going to give a special shout out, though, to Epic Remedy again for this.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:57.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.540]  Honest to God, this is what cemented my relationship with Epic Remedy.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.540]  We had lots of people that took our boxes, but this is what Epic Remedy did.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:13.540]  Epic Remedy didn't care how many cans of new food you brought in.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.540]  They gave you a dollar per can off your product that you were buying.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.540]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.540]  Yeah.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.540]  And after a week, I was like, Renz, he's the owner, you're taking a hit.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.540]  And he goes, I don't care.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.540]  It's the holidays.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.540]  We're giving back to the community.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.540]  So shout out to Renz and Epic Remedy.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:38.540]  And that dispensary was in the poorest neighborhood of all the dispensaries.
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:42.540]  That was over in Pikes Peak Park, over on Circle and Fountain.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:47.540]  It is one of the poorest neighborhoods of any of the dispensaries, but they collected the most food.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.540]  Yes.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:51.540]  Gail had to go over there countless of times.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.540]  Honestly, we ran the thing for about three weeks, right?
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.540]  I was there probably three.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.540]  Twice a week.
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:03.540]  Two to three times a week, she was going over there and picking up not just a box full, pallets.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:08.540]  She had to take the truck over there, and the entire truck was like, every time I would get pictures,
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.540]  and I'm like, just got back from Epic Remedy.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:14.540]  Shout out to 7th Floor, Silver Surfer Steve.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.540]  Yes, for letting us with the warehouse space.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:20.540]  Because we didn't really anticipate getting as much food.
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.540]  That much stuff? We were going to hold it all at the glass grind.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:26.540]  And so when Epic Remedy called me the first time, and I drive a Silverado,
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:31.540]  so the entire back of my truck was full of food, and I thought, what am I going to do?
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.540]  Steve said, you can have my warehouse.
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:37.540]  So he let us store all the food out there for three weeks.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:42.540]  Then when I did get to U-Haul, his whole crew loaded the truck up for me.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:47.540]  So shout out to the entire 7th Floor Vapes crew, because they were phenomenal.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.540]  What are we doing next?
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  God, I don't know.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.540]  Let's start working on another food drive or something.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:53.540]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:54.540]  Something to help the community.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.540]  We'll definitely have to do something.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.540]  We'll talk about it on the next episode when we bring Granny on again.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:00.540]  There you go.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.540]  Sure.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540]  Excellent.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:03.540]  We'll brainstorm.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.540]  Sam is coming up with lots of good ideas too.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.540]  Sam's a thinker.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.540]  He is a thinker.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.540]  That kid's head never stops.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.540]  He's like me.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.540]  His brain keeps just spinning.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.540]  You guys, check out THC Magazine.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.540]  The finest cover on a magazine ever.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.540]  Yes.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.540]  Right?
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.540]  They've got the best, I don't know, whatever print stock they use.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.540]  That stuff is glossy.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.540]  Right.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.540]  It's available on Barnes & Noble across the nation, so anybody anywhere can get it now.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.540]  Go check it out.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:30.540]  And I'm in this month's episode, or no, it's not episode.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]  Issue.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]  Issue.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.540]  There is an awesome picture of me.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.540]  Grace, don't.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.540]  The Heady Ambassador and Action Bronson.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.540]  Yeah.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.540]  What did Action say to you?
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.540]  He said I was going to come on Ancient Aliens.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.540]  Are you going to do it?
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540]  Are you going to go talk about aliens with him?
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.540]  If he asks me to come on, I told him, well, I see you smoke blunts.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.540]  I don't smoke a lot of blunts, so your friends can't be sitting on the couch.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.540]  You've got to leave room on the couch for me, and we're going to break in all these
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.540]  Heady pieces that I know you just bought today at Heaters.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.540]  How did he feel about all that?
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.540]  He bought three pieces.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:05.540]  He bought three sweet pieces?
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:06.540]  Yeah.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.540]  So you got at least three dabs coming with Bronson.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.540]  I don't know.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.540]  I know some of them are buck pieces, too.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.540]  So what was that?
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.540]  You told me that he gave you a quote.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.540]  What was Bronson's quote of the day?
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.540]  What was it?
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.540]  What he said he had to go do.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:18.540]  So you asked him to take a dab.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.540]  What do you have to go do?
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.540]  Oh, but I can't do impressions.
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.540]  Oh, but it's still funny just knowing Bronson says that.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:29.540]  Okay, he's got this thick Bronx accent, and he said, let's go get a sausage.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.540]  And I said, what did you say?
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:34.540]  And he just kind of looked at me, and I said, say it again.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.540]  I just love the way it sounds.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.540]  How you people from New York say sausages?
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.540]  Appealing to one's ears.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.540]  They probably feel the same about us weird Colorado folks probably think we say some funny shit ourselves.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.540]  He really is a nice guy.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.540]  I do hope I get to sit down with him again.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.540]  I hope you get to be on the Ancient Alien show.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.540]  I hope maybe Vice just comes and does a dabbing granny show because you deserve some recognition.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.540]  Yeah, that would be sweet.
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.540]  Speaking of shows, I believe The Traveling Stoner and Bobo just did an episode.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.540]  Yes, can I please give a shout out to Daily Bong?
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.540]  Shout out to Daily Bong.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:11.540]  Yeah, Daily Bong just had Chris and I on Blunted season two.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:16.540]  And it was actually really funny because we get there and he had messaged me.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:24.540]  Honestly, he messaged me a month ago, and he was like, hey, I'm going to be coming out into Colorado,
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.540]  and I'd love to get you and your man on there.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.540]  And I just really like y'all's vibes.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.540]  And I was like, that'd be awesome.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.540]  We'd love to be on it.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.540]  I knew about the show because of Metal Damian.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:37.540]  So he's on the show all the time because it's filmed in Miami.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.540]  And so I said, yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.540]  So then he messaged me at the beginning of the month, and he's like, oh, I'm going to be out there on the 15th and 16th.
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.540]  And I said, coolio.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.540]  So we get there, and I really, I just love watch the show.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.540]  So I know that the way the show goes is you sit in front of a really bright light.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:23:00.540]  You wear sunglasses, and you smoke either like a joint or a blunt or something, and he asks you questions, and you just answer them.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.540]  And like the questions are, you know, in the bottom of the, like, screen.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:11.540]  So I just knew that we were going to get asked questions, and honestly, he had put up a picture that morning, and he had tagged a bunch of people.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.540]  So I didn't really know how it goes.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.540]  So he doesn't let anybody, like, be around each other when they get taped.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:23.540]  And if you're on the same episode and, like, you can get, be in the same room.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.540]  So we get there, and he goes, oh, your episode's all about relationships.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:32.540]  And I'm like, stone-faced, I'm like, you picked the wrong couple, dude.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.540]  Straight up, you picked the wrong couple.
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.540]  You guys are a great couple.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:37.540]  You're just not the classic TV show couple.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.540]  Well, but that's what I mean.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.540]  Like, if that's what you were looking for out of this, you picked the wrong couple.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:46.540]  So it was really funny because it was like the newlywed game style kind of.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:53.540]  Like, we didn't even stay in the room with each other, and he asked us pretty much the same questions and, like, to see how we answer them.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.540]  And it was pretty comical, to be honest with you.
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.540]  Like, I'm super stoked.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.540]  Our episode is supposed to come out at the end of March.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.540]  We're episode four of season two, so.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.540]  He texted me yesterday.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.540]  Did he?
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:09.540]  He'll be back here at the end of January and asked would I maybe come up.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.540]  So I'm asking if maybe you guys will take me.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.540]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.540]  Daily Bong, check it out.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.540]  Yes, Daily Bong.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.540]  Shout out to them because it was so much fun, to be honest with you.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:25.540]  He asked just like, I mean, just I don't want to spoil our episode, so I'll tell you what's been on other episodes.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.540]  And it was really funny because I was at the Canna Canyon a couple days before.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.540]  So you're going to spoil somebody else's episode?
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.540]  No, it's already up.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.540]  I'm aware you said that.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]  It's season one.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]  It's already up.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]  It's on YouTube.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540]  OK.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540]  Yeah.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.540]  So I was at the Canna Canyon the other day, and I was showing Camille.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.540]  I was like, yo, look at what I get to go and do the other day.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.540]  I'm kind of excited.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.540]  She was the only person I told.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.540]  I didn't even tell Granny.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.540]  Like, Granny called me on the way up, and she's like, what are you doing?
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.540]  And I was like, OK, I'm going to do this really cool thing.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:55.540]  But I was showing Camille this, and it was really funny because the question was ice cream or anal.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:01.540]  And the amount of like guys that chose ice cream was insane.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.540]  Like, it was so funny to me.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.540]  Instead of anal?
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.540]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:06.540]  And it was just mind blowing to me.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.540]  And me and Cam were both like, I can't believe how many people are saying ice cream right now.
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.540]  Like, this is actually insane to me.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540]  Maybe they thought they had to receive instead of give.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.540]  Oh, good point.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.540]  Good point.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.540]  That could be it.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.540]  I'd be saying ice cream too.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.540]  But so like, so some of the questions are like, what's your favorite strain?
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.540]  You know, like, so yeah, it's just really funny because he just asked you these like questions,
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.540]  and he doesn't ask them in a certain order.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.540]  Like, there's no like, what's your name?
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.540]  Where are you from?
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.540]  Like, it's not like a gradual thing.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.540]  It's what's your name?
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:36.540]  Ice cream or anal?
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:37.540]  What's your favorite strain?
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.540]  Like, you know what I mean?
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.540]  Like, it's so back and forth like that.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.540]  Would you just dab, Chris?
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.540]  That shit smells amazing.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.540]  Yeah, what was it?
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.540]  He just made a face.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.540]  Was it a turp tail?
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.540]  Oh, he's making a video.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.540]  Oh, wait, actually, I think I can see it right here.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.540]  So I think he, the cookies from you guys at CGC.
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:54.540]  Some solvent-less.
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:57.540]  Did you put, so you put some of this syringe on there?
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.540]  You just did this cookies on its own?
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.540]  You didn't use it.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:01.540]  He can't talk.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.540]  He's so high right now.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.540]  Yeah, sorry, I tried.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.540]  Sometimes I can read him.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.540]  Give the kid ten seconds.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.540]  Oh, some turps.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.540]  ACDC turps.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.540]  That's what he put on there.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.540]  It smelled amazing when he blew it in my face.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:10.540]  Yeah, that was probably the ACDC.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.540]  So he did the, yeah.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.540]  It was a mix of everything.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:13.540]  It still smells good.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.540]  It was a mix of everything.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.540]  Still smells real good in here.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.540]  Say that again.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.540]  It was a damn good dab.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540]  Say that again, Parker.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540]  That was a mix of everything.
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.540]  That was amazing.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.540]  Holy shit.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.540]  Holy shit, that was good, man.
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:23.540]  All right.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:24.540]  He's a little reddish purple now.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.540]  We'll give him a minute.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:31.540]  You guys, I have to say, us dabbers are a breed of our own.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:36.540]  I have this solvent-less stuff called white crack OG.
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.540]  White crack OG.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:43.540]  Now, this stuff smells like some cheese that has been in a refrigerator with no power-
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:44.540]  Cheesy vomit.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:49.540]  Yeah, after you had some bad cheese, you puked it out.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.540]  Yes, everybody makes that.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.540]  It's not even in there.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.540]  Okay.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.540]  It's not even in there.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:27:02.540]  Every time I break this stuff up and people sniff it, their face is like, can I dab it?
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.540]  It smells like poop.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.540]  Can I have some?
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:06.540]  It smells like your butt after a run.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:12.540]  It's just amazing that we want to dab something that smells so bad.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:17.540]  I'm going to take a dab of it just because I'm brave and I'm very curious what it actually tastes like.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.540]  It's delicious.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.540]  Just enough to taste.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:20.540]  It's delicious, huh?
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:22.540]  It tastes just like your butt after a run.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.540]  Fuck.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:28.540]  No, after suppository leakage.
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.540]  There's none of that.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:34.540]  We've already talked about it.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]  But it tastes good, right?
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.540]  Yeah, it doesn't taste like dog poop or anything.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.540]  It doesn't taste like the cheesy vomit it smells like.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.540]  Cheesy vomit.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.540]  That's exactly what it smells like.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.540]  I approve, though.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540]  I'm high from it, too.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.540]  White crack OG smells like a can of dog farts.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.540]  So we're saying that it's probably green crack.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.540]  What do you think the white is?
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.540]  White widow?
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:56.540]  The white.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:57.540]  The white?
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.540]  The white, probably, yeah.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.540]  Don't get me on that rant.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.540]  I hate that extraction companies do that.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:07.540]  I think that it should say the white and green crack or something on there because that's misleading.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:10.540]  We're medical consumers and we like to know what strains we're consuming.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.540]  And there's a lot of people that don't have the knowledge or friends.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:17.540]  Like I have knowledge because I have friends like you guys that pass it on to me.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.540]  Somebody might walk in there.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.540]  They wouldn't know what the hell that is.
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:22.540]  Right.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:27.540]  And if they want it, maybe green crack gives them panic attacks and the white is perfect for them.
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.540]  Because we all know green crack is a pretty heavy sativa.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:36.540]  And I'm learning more and more young bud tenders don't really know what different strains will do.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.540]  That's very true.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:38.540]  Oh God, please don't get me started.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.540]  That's a whole episode.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.540]  Another one.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:43.540]  Can we talk about something that you did since we've been talking about suppositories?
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.540]  Sure.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:51.540]  I heard a rumor, I heard a little story that you took a gram of distillate and you used it as a suppository?
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.540]  Yes.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.540]  How was that?
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.540]  Ping, ping, ping, crochet rabbit.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.540]  So it was a sativa.
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:01.540]  What's so funny is she actually used green crack the first time she did it.
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.540]  That's what reminded my brain.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.540]  It's in my notes that are on the floor.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.540]  I used crack in my crack.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:10.540]  So you put some green crack in your brown crack and it made you bounce around all day.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.540]  It was a heavy sativa.
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:18.540]  Yes, I guess for cleaning the house or something, but it was a little too much.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.540]  I would not recommend.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:21.540]  Not the whole thing.
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:26.540]  I have a pretty high tolerance, so if I'm saying I don't recommend, maybe half a gram.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.540]  Or just use a normal suppository.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:30.540]  Yes, yes.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.540]  Because...
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:34.540]  A butt tender told me to do it.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:35.540]  So you did.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.540]  They told me to jump off the bridge.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:38.540]  I tried it.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.540]  I thought I was going to go read.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.540]  I don't think he meant the entire syringe.
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:46.540]  One thing I will say about these syringes, they're good for cooking.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.540]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:50.540]  If you want to put a little distillate in your food.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:53.540]  Like meatballs and spaghetti sauce.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.540]  I might have some hot cocoa with some distillate in it later tonight.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.540]  Oh no, I have a different way to make hot cocoa.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.540]  Shumit bars.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.540]  Shout out to Caleb.
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.540]  Did you see my picture the other night?
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.540]  That was so awesome.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:09.540]  I had some s'mores hot cocoa.
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.540]  Made that, it was real, and I made it with milk, cold milk.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.540]  Nice and creamy.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:20.540]  I took a 200 milligram Shumit s'mores bar and grated that in there.
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.540]  I feel warm and fuzzy inside just thinking about it.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.540]  A big dollop of marshmallow cream.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.540]  Oh my gosh.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.540]  It was so good.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:31.540]  I drank that all, all 200 milligrams.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:32.540]  I slept really good that night.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:33.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.540]  They're made with pure distillate.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.540]  They're so good.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.540]  That's my favorite edible right now.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.540]  Caleb makes good candy.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.540]  Really good candy.
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:44.540]  I go through these phases where I do and don't do edibles,
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:47.540]  and I think one of our good friends may have just messed up my edibles kit.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.540]  No, you shouldn't.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.540]  You'll be fine.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.540]  I know what Jeff is saying.
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:53.540]  It stays with me for too long.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:55.540]  The next day, I feel really good when I eat the edibles,
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:59.540]  but the next day I feel slow motion, and I'm a very productive dude,
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.540]  and I can't be dragging ass.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.540]  You got them brain locks like, oh, I can't think.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.540]  A little bit, but it's more my body.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.540]  I feel like I'm just weighed down.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.540]  I've just got weights on my legs.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.540]  How much are you eating?
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:11.540]  Way too much.
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:16.540]  Yeah, but that was the issue, was the two times that we've eaten too much.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.540]  First time was your own fault.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.540]  Second time, we didn't realize how much that cake was, really.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.540]  Yeah, we ate a cake at Lindsay's birthday.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.540]  Yeah.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.540]  Is that what made the car?
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.540]  Yes, I was floating.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.540]  I was certainly floating.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:37.540]  In our defense, we tried to do smaller slices, but the restaurant wasn't.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.540]  They were super polite.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:41.540]  They all have learned that I'm a strict vegetarian,
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.540]  and they put bacon on the cake,
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.540]  and there was a specific section of cake with no bacon.
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:49.540]  And so they were super polite about it, and they were courteous and fed me.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:51.540]  So I was like, I'm going to eat this.
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.540]  And it was super tasty.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.540]  But by the next morning when I was still high, when I woke up,
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.540]  I was like, what the fuck did they put in that thing?
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.540]  And it was TNT extractions.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:00.540]  Yes.
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:01.540]  Yes.
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:02.540]  He's gotten both of us.
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.540]  And I'm the plug, not the extension cord.
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.540]  Dwayne as well.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:07.540]  It was both of them, Max and Dwayne.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.540]  I don't believe I met.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.540]  They're always together, so you probably have.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]  You probably have.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.540]  You probably just don't realize it.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.540]  But yeah.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.540]  But yeah, shout out to them, because that cake was superb.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.540]  And the bacon that they make.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.540]  Oh, his bacon is good.
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.540]  You don't know, but the bacon that they make is really good.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.540]  And the hash that they make is super good too.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.540]  The hash was delicious.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.540]  They know that I don't eat the bacon, so they bring extra concentrates to dab with me.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.540]  They're like, we brought this for you, buddy, just so that they could kind of make me.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.540]  We're sorry.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:40.540]  We're sorry you're involved here.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:41.540]  This is what you get.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.540]  You don't get bacon.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:43.540]  You get this.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:50.540]  And for you listeners out there, I know you hear them silly-ass rumors about ODing from cannabis.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.540]  It doesn't happen.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.540]  We're not going to hallucinate like that.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.540]  We've been trying all night.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:56.540]  Yeah, for real.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:57.540]  But that reporter said.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540]  It's Chris's goal to OD on weed.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.540]  He wants to be the first person to ever OD on weed.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:01.540]  Me too.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.540]  Do you want to hallucinate from cannabis?
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:03.540]  I mean, come on.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.540]  We're trying so hard, we're putting it in our butts.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.540]  And it's not working.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.540]  Legitimately.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:07.540]  You know what's going to happen?
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.540]  You're going to take a whole lot.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.540]  You're going to dab a lot.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.540]  You're going to do too many suppositories.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.540]  You're going to fall asleep.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.540]  You're going to wake up tomorrow.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:13.540]  You're going to have a weed over.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:14.540]  Yep.
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:15.540]  Like Jeff said.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.540]  You're going to be hungry.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.540]  Yep.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.540]  Very.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.540]  A little lazy.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.540]  Yep.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.540]  And that's it.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.540]  Dehydrated, possibly.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.540]  Need some caffeine.
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.540]  That's why you'll always see water with dabbers.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.540]  We always have liquids around us.
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.540]  I've got caffeine and water.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:27.540]  They keep me alive.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.540]  Yep.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.540]  So, contrary to the bullshit you hear on some of them news shows on TV, we're going to
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.540]  have a weed over.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:31.540]  And we're going to have a weed over.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:32.540]  And we're going to have a weed over.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.540]  And we're going to have a weed over.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.540]  And we're going to have a weed over.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.540]  And you're going to overdose.
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.420]  You're not going to overdose on cannabis.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.500]  The only way you can die from cannabis is if a ton of it falls on your head and kills
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.500]  you.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.500]  Or maybe if you're eating a pound and it lodges in your throat.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.400]  I mean, but who's going to really?
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.780]  Or if the cops kick in your door and kill you for having it.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:56.100]  That's the problem with cannabis.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.660]  Police are more dangerous than cannabis.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.620]  Jello is more dangerous than cannabis.
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.620]  All right.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.780]  You guys, we've been going for an hour and 35 minutes.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.800]  This is one of the longest podcasts.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.800]  Yes.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.800]  There was no reason to stop it.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.980]  The conversation got natural and wonderful.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:08.380]  I was like, I'm going to let this keep going.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.620]  You look exhausted over there.
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:10.460]  Be quiet for a minute.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.300]  You tired?
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.120]  You all right?
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.460]  You guys super quiet and sat back a minute ago.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.780]  I was like, oh, she's got to drive two hours.
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:16.740]  It's one of them waves.
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.500]  Yeah, no, but no, I was just thinking.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.720]  My only thought was, well,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.940]  you guys were talking about the edibles.
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.260]  That's the problem with them these days.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.620]  They are so good that you just eat more of it.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.900]  Yeah, we've talked on this show
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:30.340]  that we need to buy edibles that come with like package A
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.820]  and package B and A is medicated and B is not
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.140]  so that you can eat one of A and then four or five of B
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.300]  and you'll be all right
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.820]  because we find ourselves wrecked at this table sometimes
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:39.820]  when it's edibles night.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.940]  Yeah, we're actually looking at doing one
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:46.940]  of our edibles being primarily CBD and lower THC.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.980]  So, you know, to kind of, just for that market.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:50.940]  So, cause you know, again,
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.460]  the edibles market's already been created.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.960]  So we want to kind of come in
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.220]  and bring something off or something else.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.620]  So it's going to be a high CBD, low THC ratios.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.460]  Excellent.
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.420]  Don't know exactly what those are yet.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.780]  Those to be announced.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:02.620]  Soon come.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.660]  Yes.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.340]  It's cannabis industry is always evolving.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.180]  I love it.
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:08.340]  Every week there's something new we didn't have.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.180]  What's the new thing?
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:12.380]  The high terpene.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.220]  What's the HTSFERQ.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.060]  C S.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:16.900]  ERQ.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.140]  C S F S.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.220]  Yeah, I think you had it for a while.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:24.220]  The high terpene full spectrum extract.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.260]  Holy shit.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:26.100]  Yeah.
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.340]  I can't even do it full spectrum.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:28.180]  Yeah.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.020]  What is this?
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:29.980]  It's the new tech.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.820]  It's like that sauce kind of,
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:33.140]  it's where it separates.
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.260]  That shit I got?
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.100]  Yeah.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:36.060]  That's part of it.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:36.900]  That's some of it.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:37.740]  I got some of that.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.580]  Chris doesn't have a microphone.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.420]  You guys saw it.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:41.820]  What it was, how he explained it to me.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.020]  It's like terp sauce, but it's potent shit.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:45.860]  Right, right.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.020]  That's what they call it in full spectrum.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:47.860]  The FS and that.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:50.540]  He called it, and it's super lemon haze.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:52.140]  So that's straight sativa to the dome.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.620]  Oh hell yes.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:57.380]  But he called it sugar wax without the sugar.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.220]  Okay.
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.060]  That kind of makes sense.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.060]  And when you tip it, I mean, it's.
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:01.900]  It's liquidy?
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.740]  Yes.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:03.580]  Yeah, that's what it should be.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:04.420]  But it's not like this terps.
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:05.780]  It's not like evil lab terps.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.220]  Yeah, what she got is just,
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.900]  she got just the crystals by themselves
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.020]  and then the sauce in its own vial.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:13.860]  Okay.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.740]  So she got like just the top layer of terps
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.460]  that just comes off in its own vial
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:21.860]  of just like lemony, skunky, unbelievableness.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.300]  It was good stuff, wasn't it?
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.500]  It was so good.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.820]  So let's shout him out too.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.460]  Yoshi extracts.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:32.260]  You make good super lemon haze.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.660]  So Yoshi, hit me up, brother man.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.420]  Come on, what's going on?
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.020]  Girl from your heart at hotmail.com.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.820]  I love lemon.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.140]  All right, you guys, we've been going for an hour
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.220]  and 36 minutes.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.260]  I think it's probably a good time to wrap up the podcast.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.300]  I know everybody's got to get out of town to get home.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.740]  These kids live across town.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.140]  I need a big fat dab.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.940]  Does anybody have anything they'd like to say
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.180]  while they've still got a bunch of people listening to them?
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.020]  Nothing, Chris?
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.900]  You don't want to be like, check out my Instagram
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.020]  and buy my glass.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.020]  Yeah, definitely check out Nomi Glass.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:01.980]  And definitely check out Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:02.820]  There you go.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:03.980]  Good job, Lindsay.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:04.820]  Tell us about your website.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:05.660]  Sorry, I didn't mean to skip you there.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.180]  I'm just going to go around in a circle.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.380]  Cool, I am the traveling stoner
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.540]  and the travelingstoner.com will be up and running
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.260]  on January 31st.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.900]  And she just hit 5,000.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.460]  Well, over five now.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.020]  Yeah, actually, I just think I hit 56.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:21.220]  You can go, girl.
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.900]  Yeah, so that's the traveling stoner on Instagram.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.100]  And I'm pretty much that solidly-ish
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.620]  in variations across the board.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.460]  Yeah, check her out, you guys.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.300]  Periscope.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:31.140]  Periscope.
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.980]  She's been periscoping a lot in the mornings.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.180]  Yes.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:35.100]  She wears clothes now.
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.900]  Yep, thanks.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:41.540]  But she has a really cute booger.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.860]  Her dog is cute.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.180]  I like watching those snaps and periscopes with Scoob.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.740]  I like her little white panties.
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:51.580]  Dodging this.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:52.420]  Yeah, I know.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.260]  Dodging this conversation.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.420]  I'm trying, I'm trying.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.300]  You can't, you can't dodge it with her.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.660]  But yeah, Scooby's cute as hell, man.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:58.500]  Yes, yes.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.460]  For sure.
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:03.300]  So yeah, you can follow our Grow on Instagram.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:06.300]  We've got a Grow site or a Grow page or whatever.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.660]  Okay, so like your commercial,
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.260]  Grow, you can actually check the progress there?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:10.100]  Exactly.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:11.340]  Okay, I'm gonna follow that myself.
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:12.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.700]  So that's CGC Black Label.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:15.540]  Okay.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.660]  We've just had some internet or Instagram troll,
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.500]  is that what it's called?
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.100]  That's kind of given us a hard time on our Concentrate side.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.860]  So I'm still working on that.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.340]  But you can definitely follow us
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.180]  and get in touch with us through that one directly too.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.740]  You gotta get used to the trolls.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:29.780]  Just block them and move forward.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:31.300]  Those are Jeff's favorites.
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.580]  I'll slay a fucking troll if I need to.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:34.500]  Bring it, come on.
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:37.460]  Me too, you ever been in one of my lives?
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.700]  We handle them fairly similarly, yep.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.100]  I was just gonna say, do you have any names
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.500]  you wanna shout out that our trolls can go after?
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.740]  Yeah, no, I'm not like that.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.620]  I'm not vindictive, let him do his thing.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.860]  He'll eventually settle down and move on.
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.300]  All right, all right.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.460]  So you've got a Grow Instagram that we can follow,
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.140]  CGC Black Label.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:58.980]  Yes.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.460]  How else can we follow you on social media?
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:01.460]  If you want us to, you don't have to give us
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:02.300]  your personal stuff. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:04.220]  I mean, my personal one, which is,
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.300]  I mean, if you wanna see part of my personal life as well,
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.820]  but I do put products and information about the products
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.460]  and stuff that we have and CGC in general.

[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.220]  All right, you'll get some follows from that.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:20.740]  Yeah, she has a cool lizard.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.060]  His name's Diego.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.140]  I'm already curious, now I'm gonna go follow
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:26.340]  just because of Diego.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.580]  Oh, and they're smiley.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:28.940]  Smiley's a hoot too.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.500]  What type of creature is smiley?
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:31.620]  Smiley's my Corgi.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.500]  Okay, how cute, how cute.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.860]  But this big-ish?
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:35.700]  Lap-sized?
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.140]  No, he's like, he's pretty fat.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:37.980]  He's a big guy.
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.820]  He's pretty fat.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.180]  What are you feeding that thing?
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.580]  He's just, he's a big guy.
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:42.900]  We just call him Fat Man.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.260]  Fat Man, happy dog, happy dog.
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:46.180]  Well, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.020]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:47.860]  It's always great to have new people.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:49.860]  We learned a lot about suppositories today.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:51.540]  I learned a lot about your other products.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.820]  People learned about Solventless.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.980]  They learned about Rosin.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:56.540]  So thank you for helping me teach people about cannabis.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:57.900]  Thank you, I really appreciate it.
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.100]  You're welcome back when you have more products
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.260]  or when you just wanna come hang out.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.100]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:02.820]  You don't have to have products.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.780]  Oh, I never come empty-handed.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.500]  I'm a good guest.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.300]  I appreciate that.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.900]  All right, Ms. Granny, it's your turn.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.140]  Oh, thank you for having me.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.900]  I think I probably said everything I needed to say
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.340]  and that's really unbelievable, isn't it?
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.060]  But it's always a pleasure to come
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.420]  and hang out with you, Rasta Jeff.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.620]  I enjoy it all the time.
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:21.780]  I appreciate you coming and hanging out.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.620]  It's super kind of you.
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.020]  You guys come from Colorado Springs.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:24.860]  It's super kind of you.
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:25.780]  Do you come from Denver or Springs?
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:26.620]  Absolutely Denver.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.380]  Wow, so you've got two hours to get home.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.220]  Thanks for staying.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.580]  Yeah, I gotta take Granny up and then I'm on my way.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.420]  Yeah, Granny, keep her late.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.580]  Thank you, Lindsey.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.780]  Thank you, Traveling Stoner,
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.820]  for always putting things together.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.940]  You guys got it.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.260]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:41.180]  I'm here to help get everyone together in one place.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.460]  Yes, this podcast is not out of reach.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:44.380]  Some people have told me, they're like,
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:45.540]  dude, I'd love to be on your show,
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.900]  but I don't know what I would do.
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.940]  You would come and you would talk.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:48.780]  It's not that hard.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:49.900]  I've got a chair, I've got a microphone,
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.900]  and you just run your face.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.340]  We're gonna do it without a microphone anyway.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.660]  So come and let me know what you've got to say.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.220]  If you wanna be on the podcast and you're not crazy,
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.060]  and you've got something interesting to talk about,
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:40:59.900]  send me an email.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.620]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.300]  I'd love to get all kinds of people on the show.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.260]  Open up the audience, open up the members.
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.100]  What are you guys, the guests?
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:07.940]  Open it up.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:10.260]  Just teach more, learn more, do more, better podcast.
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.620]  Come be on the show.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.860]  I'm gonna talk about Patreon,
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.060]  and then we're gonna wrap up the podcast.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.500]  I would love it if you guys go to patreon.com.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.780]  What Patreon is is a website that would allow you
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.460]  to support the podcast financially.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.420]  I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast, you guys.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.940]  The podcast will always be free.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.180]  Free freedom, free cannabis lessons, free love.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.180]  I do it from my heart.
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.980]  I can't shut the fuck up about cannabis.
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.460]  This is my way of putting it out.
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.900]  I love weed, I love you guys.
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.100]  But if you wanna throw a buck or two my way,
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:36.260]  you can go to patreon.com.
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:38.900]  You sign up, go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:40.140]  Find the podcast.
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:41.700]  You can throw down $1 a month,
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.420]  or you can throw down as many dollars as a month
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.620]  that you would like.
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:46.500]  What that will do is it'll help me pay for my website.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.060]  I read geneticscolorado.com.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.100]  It is a little costly to keep that website up,
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.700]  and that is where the podcast is hosted.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.140]  So just help me pay for that a little bit if you can.
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:56.300]  If you can, I would appreciate it.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:57.540]  If you can't do it, I still love you.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.100]  High five, big hug, fat dabs.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:41:59.940]  We're still gonna be friends.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:01.220]  But there are a few people out there
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.100]  that can certainly afford to throw a buck or two my way.
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.140]  I would appreciate it.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:05.140]  We'll keep the podcast going.
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:07.260]  We'll keep it free forever for everyone.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.420]  So patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.020]  That's all I'm gonna say about that.
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.820]  I think that was Forrest Gumpy when I said that, huh?
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:14.260]  That's all I'm gonna say about that.
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.300]  All right, we're gonna end it with that.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.980]  Once again, check out handmadeapparel.biz.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.580]  Thank you, everybody, for coming.
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:22.860]  I'm gonna wrap up the show.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.980]  Big shout out to, who did we give?
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.140]  Well, we gave shout outs to everybody.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.420]  We're always in the show with one big shout out.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.260]  Who's it going to this time?
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.540]  Somebody throw me an idea.
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:32.780]  Silence, big shout out to silence.
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:33.620]  Brett.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.140]  Brett from Evo Labs?
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:35.980]  Yeah.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.820]  Brett from Evo Labs.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.260]  Dancy Brett, Mary's Motivation.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.100]  Yeah, Mary's Motivation.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.460]  He's in this month's THC magazine as well.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.300]  Oh, there we go.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.140]  He is with the big cheesy smile.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.060]  Yes, he is accepting that award.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:46.660]  Big pin of the year.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.580]  So, yep, shout out to Mary's Motivation.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:50.300]  Just because I love him.
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:53.100]  Every time I see him, he's so happy to see me
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.940]  and it's so genuine and I just love Brett.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.660]  And he is so positive.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:02.660]  He wants to spread the most positive messages about cannabis.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.420]  He's just a good guy.
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:06.540]  And he gave me a fat sack of weed
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.500]  for my birthday that he grew.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.340]  Some lemon skunk diesel.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.620]  He knows me so well.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:12.860]  He gave me a fat sack.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.620]  He's like, this is for you for your birthday.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.020]  I was like, yes, thank you, Brett.
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:16.860]  It's a unanimous decision.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:19.460]  Big shout out to our friend Brett from Evo Labs.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.580]  Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:21.940]  It's Mary's underscore motivation.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:22.780]  No, he took the underscore out.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.140]  Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:25.500]  Just Mary's Motivation.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.540]  He took the underscore out.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.900]  Mary's Motivation.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.820]  Brett from Evo Labs.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:29.980]  Big shout out, brother.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:32.300]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.860]  and give your mom a hug for me.
