[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Hey, welcome to the show, ganja smokers and ganja growers.
[00:02.800 --> 00:07.100]  It is time for episode 442 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.100 --> 00:10.460]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.460 --> 00:14.900]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:14.900 --> 00:21.020]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.020 --> 00:25.380]  It has come a bit of a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[00:25.380 --> 00:26.380]  smoking.
[00:26.540 --> 00:30.300]  I've been taking dabs of Stardog batter from Apothecary Farms.
[00:30.300 --> 00:38.120]  The label says this product contains 68.4% THC and 79.9% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.500]  I've been scooping up big chunks of the Stardog batter, and then I'm dunking that in the leftover
[00:42.500 --> 00:45.260]  turps from a jar of GG4 Ambrosia.
[00:45.260 --> 00:46.660]  I bought a big jar of the GG4.
[00:46.660 --> 00:51.140]  It had a lot of saucy turps in the bottom of it, so I am using the Stardog batter as
[00:51.140 --> 00:57.140]  a sponge to soak up the GG4 turps, and these dabs are delicious and tremendous.
[00:57.140 --> 00:58.620]  I'm always a fan of Stardog.
[00:58.620 --> 01:02.700]  I am always a fan of the GG4, and when you mix the two, it is really delicious.
[01:02.700 --> 01:05.860]  I want to call this some gorilla dog or something like that.
[01:05.860 --> 01:06.860]  This is a great combination.
[01:06.860 --> 01:12.020]  So, a big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious concentrates.
[01:12.020 --> 01:13.140]  All right, podcast world.
[01:13.140 --> 01:15.380]  I am recording on the 3rd of July.
[01:15.380 --> 01:17.980]  We are going to talk briefly about the 4th of July.
[01:17.980 --> 01:20.380]  Then we're going to talk more about 7-10.
[01:20.380 --> 01:24.940]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to some of our friends on Patreon.
[01:24.940 --> 01:29.020]  I want to give a huge Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my friend Jacob W.
[01:29.020 --> 01:31.140]  I want to give a giant shout out to Keith K.
[01:31.140 --> 01:34.660]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to Tommy W.
[01:34.660 --> 01:38.480]  Of course, a Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and fist bump to Brett G.
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.180]  As always, a giant fist bump to my friend Dick Goals.
[01:41.180 --> 01:46.660]  How about a big shout out to Steven F., and as always, a giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[01:46.660 --> 01:49.020]  shout out to our friend Baphsta.
[01:49.020 --> 01:53.380]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:53.380 --> 01:59.180]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[01:59.180 --> 02:01.260]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:01.260 --> 02:04.300]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:04.300 --> 02:05.900]  All right, podcast world.
[02:05.900 --> 02:08.900]  I said we were going to talk briefly about the 4th of July.
[02:08.900 --> 02:12.700]  If you hear a bunch of noise outside, a bunch of explosions in the background of this recording,
[02:12.700 --> 02:15.340]  that is because I am recording at the start of July.
[02:15.340 --> 02:18.700]  And where I live, we like to get started a little bit early.
[02:19.380 --> 02:20.500]  Everybody is blowing shit up.
[02:20.500 --> 02:24.500]  Everybody's had their fireworks going since about the 1st of July in my neighborhood.
[02:24.500 --> 02:27.620]  The sun just went down about an hour ago, so they are really getting going.
[02:27.620 --> 02:29.620]  It is going to be a party in my neighborhood.
[02:29.620 --> 02:31.740]  So if you hear some noise, please excuse that.
[02:31.740 --> 02:33.180]  We're just having a good time.
[02:33.180 --> 02:37.580]  I hope everybody out there has a safe and joyous 4th of July.
[02:37.580 --> 02:38.700]  Be careful, you guys.
[02:38.700 --> 02:40.340]  Don't get yourselves blown up.
[02:40.340 --> 02:41.860]  Don't get yourselves in any trouble.
[02:41.860 --> 02:43.060]  Don't get a DUI.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.060]  Be safe out there.
[02:44.060 --> 02:48.140]  And if you do throw a barbecue, don't forget about your vegetarian friends.
[02:48.140 --> 02:51.340]  Have something available for those folks who don't want to eat a burger.
[02:51.340 --> 02:52.340]  Don't make fun of us.
[02:52.340 --> 02:53.340]  Invite us over.
[02:53.340 --> 02:55.140]  We want to have a good time too.
[02:55.140 --> 02:57.100]  That's all I've got for the 4th of July.
[02:57.100 --> 02:59.140]  Let's segue into talking about 7-10.
[02:59.140 --> 03:02.620]  7-10 is the next big holiday we are going to celebrate.
[03:02.620 --> 03:03.820]  What is 7-10?
[03:03.820 --> 03:07.340]  Some people may not be up to speed on what 7-10 is.
[03:07.340 --> 03:11.220]  As my buddy Adam Ill puts it, 7-10 is the new 420.
[03:11.220 --> 03:13.940]  7-10, upside down, says oil.
[03:13.940 --> 03:18.060]  So if you write 7-10, flip it upside down, that says oil.
[03:18.060 --> 03:20.740]  My friend TaskRoc wanted something new.
[03:20.740 --> 03:23.660]  Everybody's been talking about 420 for a long time.
[03:23.660 --> 03:26.660]  Task needed something to help represent the oil movement.
[03:26.660 --> 03:30.620]  So him and a few other folks coined the phrase 7-10.
[03:30.620 --> 03:33.860]  And the 7-10 movement became the new concentrate movement.
[03:33.860 --> 03:36.860]  7-10 is when you're supposed to take a fat dab.
[03:36.860 --> 03:39.340]  7-10 represents the oil movement.
[03:39.340 --> 03:41.300]  So that's where 7-10 came from.
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.960]  That's what 7-10 is all about.
[03:42.960 --> 03:45.340]  That's where the 7-10 culture erupted from.
[03:45.340 --> 03:51.740]  So 7-10 is all about smoking oil, smoking concentrates, taking a dab, however you want
[03:51.740 --> 03:52.740]  to do it.
[03:52.740 --> 03:55.500]  It has evolved so far since those days.
[03:55.500 --> 03:59.360]  I remember just a few years ago, we would get concentrate that we thought was the most
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.060]  amazing shit on the planet.
[04:01.060 --> 04:02.060]  We would smoke it.
[04:02.060 --> 04:04.320]  We would be completely impressed.
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.140]  It started off as this kind of dark colored, kind of looked like glass.
[04:08.140 --> 04:09.140]  It kind of looked like candy.
[04:09.140 --> 04:10.220]  We called it shatter.
[04:10.220 --> 04:11.880]  It started off like that.
[04:11.880 --> 04:13.300]  Then it got a little better.
[04:13.300 --> 04:14.940]  Then people started making it more clear.
[04:15.540 --> 04:16.540]  It started getting more shattery.
[04:16.540 --> 04:17.660]  It got a little tastier.
[04:17.660 --> 04:18.660]  We started learning more.
[04:18.660 --> 04:19.660]  It got better.
[04:19.660 --> 04:21.900]  Then people started making live resin.
[04:21.900 --> 04:25.620]  We started seeing a whole bunch of new consistencies, a bunch of new textures.
[04:25.620 --> 04:29.780]  Then a lot of us started laughing at ourselves because something we were smoking six months
[04:29.780 --> 04:33.140]  ago, we would not even touch at this new point in time.
[04:33.140 --> 04:36.220]  It seems like the concentrate world keeps evolving.
[04:36.220 --> 04:40.180]  It seems like about every six months, there's a brand new tech or a brand new product out
[04:40.180 --> 04:42.260]  that blows the concentrate market away.
[04:42.260 --> 04:45.820]  Then I laugh because I'm thinking, weren't we smoking the best shit on the planet just
[04:45.820 --> 04:46.820]  six months ago?
[04:46.820 --> 04:52.620]  Now we have vastly improved that to where the things I was smoking in 2010, I probably
[04:52.620 --> 04:54.300]  would just pass and laugh at now.
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.620]  I would not even consume that.
[04:56.620 --> 04:58.780]  We went from that shattery stuff.
[04:58.780 --> 05:00.220]  We had live resin.
[05:00.220 --> 05:03.300]  People started making better consistencies of live resin.
[05:03.300 --> 05:05.940]  Then we started seeing sauce and turps come out.
[05:05.940 --> 05:07.940]  Then we started seeing big crystals.
[05:07.940 --> 05:12.460]  Now you can go to the dispensary and you can get just about any consistency you want.
[05:12.460 --> 05:14.820]  On my table, I don't really fuck with shatter.
[05:14.820 --> 05:16.980]  No offense to the people that still smoke shatter.
[05:16.980 --> 05:18.620]  I don't smoke shatter anymore.
[05:18.620 --> 05:20.020]  I've moved forward from that.
[05:20.020 --> 05:22.020]  No offense if that's still what you're doing.
[05:22.020 --> 05:25.220]  Be in your time, do what you're doing.
[05:25.220 --> 05:26.340]  You can have shatter.
[05:26.340 --> 05:30.460]  I've got some batter here on the table that looks like cheesecake batter.
[05:30.460 --> 05:35.140]  I have got some HCFSE, just looks like diamonds and little rocks.
[05:35.180 --> 05:38.860]  I've got some turps that is just saucy and looks like golden water.
[05:38.860 --> 05:39.860]  I've got some ambrosia.
[05:39.860 --> 05:43.020]  It kind of looks like a glass of tea with ice cubes in it.
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.220]  It's so beautiful.
[05:44.220 --> 05:47.660]  I have got some, we've got all kinds of different textures and consistencies.
[05:47.660 --> 05:51.900]  We have come so far in this oil industry since we started this movement.
[05:51.900 --> 05:55.220]  Now people are learning how to squish buds and they're making rosin.
[05:55.220 --> 05:59.860]  I've seen people making diamonds, solid diamonds out of rosin that they're making at home.
[05:59.860 --> 06:02.660]  The 7-10 movement has come a long way.
[06:02.660 --> 06:07.500]  I really give a lot of credit of the coining of the phrase 7-10 to my buddy Taskrock from
[06:07.500 --> 06:11.100]  Highly Educated Titanium, also now Highly Educated Quartz.
[06:11.100 --> 06:14.500]  They make great gavels and bangers, so make sure you check them out.
[06:14.500 --> 06:16.140]  But it has come a long way.
[06:16.140 --> 06:19.900]  So when we talk about 7-10, we are generally talking about dabbing.
[06:19.900 --> 06:21.340]  We're talking about oil.
[06:21.340 --> 06:27.020]  We're talking about the concentrate movement that sort of spawned from the cannabis revolution.
[06:27.020 --> 06:32.060]  There is the cannabis crowd, but then the dab crowd is a completely different level.
[06:32.060 --> 06:35.820]  You can spot the dab crowd when you go to the cannabis events.
[06:35.820 --> 06:41.500]  So I feel like that is a great way to segue into talking about 7-10 events.
[06:41.500 --> 06:43.060]  What is coming up for 7-10?
[06:43.060 --> 06:45.460]  What are you doing for the 7-10 holiday?
[06:45.460 --> 06:49.580]  7-10 falls in the middle of the week this year, so there will be events on the weekend
[06:49.580 --> 06:52.580]  before and the weekend after 7-10.
[06:52.580 --> 06:57.100]  And that also means that when 7-10 happens in the middle of the week, wherever you are,
[06:57.100 --> 07:01.820]  whatever you're doing, it is time to get yourself a big fat dab and join the world and take
[07:01.860 --> 07:05.540]  a dab at 7-10 for the 7-10 movement.
[07:05.540 --> 07:09.380]  I will be spending the weekend before 7-10 getting ready for an event.
[07:09.380 --> 07:15.340]  The weekend after 7-10, I will be at the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration at Cultivated
[07:15.340 --> 07:16.340]  Synergy.
[07:16.340 --> 07:21.040]  Cultivated Synergy is in Denver, Colorado in the RINO district, and that is on the Saturday
[07:21.040 --> 07:22.860]  night after 7-10.
[07:22.860 --> 07:27.500]  So if you can be there, I look forward to seeing you at the Dude Grows Concentration
[07:27.500 --> 07:31.360]  Celebration for tickets and information on that event.
[07:31.400 --> 07:34.880]  I would recommend you visit dudegrows.com.
[07:34.880 --> 07:38.420]  There is a 7-10 cup tab right on the front of their website.
[07:38.420 --> 07:39.420]  Click right there.
[07:39.420 --> 07:43.720]  All of the information you need for the event should be easily accessible.
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.440]  So I look forward to seeing you at the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration.
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.640]  I will be there with my brand new booth setup.
[07:49.640 --> 07:52.700]  I will also have Dab and Granny at my booth.
[07:52.700 --> 07:57.560]  Come say hi, take a dab, get a hug from Dab and Granny, get a hug from myself, take some
[07:57.560 --> 07:58.560]  photos.
[07:58.560 --> 08:02.880]  I will also have a very limited supply of the brand new Irie Genetics Drop.
[08:02.880 --> 08:04.640]  So stop by the booth and say hi.
[08:04.640 --> 08:07.080]  I look forward to seeing you at the event.
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.280]  I am also doing a special drop for 7-10.
[08:11.280 --> 08:16.680]  On 7-10, I will be releasing three Feminized Seedlines through my vendors.
[08:16.680 --> 08:22.120]  The things that will be available on 7-10 are Golden Goat Feminized Seeds, Orange Gasm
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.000]  Feminized Seeds, and the Return of Lemon Jeffrey Feminized Seeds.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.320]  Those will all be available on 7-10 at seedsherenow.com.
[08:32.320 --> 08:40.720]  They will be available at dankseed.store, and you will be able to find them at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[08:40.720 --> 08:42.480]  So check those three websites.
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.440]  Make sure you grab them before they run out.
[08:44.440 --> 08:51.020]  Also, I will have very limited supplies of these new lines at the Dude Grows Concentration
[08:51.020 --> 08:52.020]  Celebration.
[08:52.020 --> 08:55.720]  So if you're able to attend the event, stop by the booth and grab some before they run
[08:55.720 --> 08:56.720]  out.
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.640]  The Golden Goat is a Golden Goat S1.
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.760]  That is a female Golden Goat pollinated by a reversed Golden Goat female that made pollen.
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.920]  So that is a Golden Goat Feminized Seed.
[09:05.920 --> 09:11.560]  The Orange Gasm is a Platinum Tangy female pollinated by the reversed Golden Goat.
[09:11.560 --> 09:16.380]  And the Lemon Jeffrey is a Lemon Skunk pollinated by the reversed Golden Goat.
[09:16.380 --> 09:21.280]  All three of those have been quite sought after, and they all three make amazing concentrates.
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.680]  So make sure you catch these before they are gone.
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.960]  The Feminized Seeds will also be available at Organtica in New Mexico.
[09:29.960 --> 09:35.480]  So if you are a New Mexico medical marijuana patient, Organtica in Albuquerque will have
[09:35.480 --> 09:38.920]  the Feminized Seeds on 710.
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.460]  That is only available to New Mexico medical marijuana patients.
[09:42.460 --> 09:46.840]  You have to have all of your New Mexico medical marijuana paperwork up to work and valid,
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.360]  and you have to have your ID.
[09:48.360 --> 09:52.960]  If you've got all the proper paperwork, stop by Organtica, grab yourself some Feminized
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.920]  Seeds, tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[09:55.920 --> 09:59.840]  If you would like email updates about where my seeds are available, if you would like
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.360]  email updates about sales I am having or events I may be attending, or perhaps maybe I will
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.120]  send out coupon codes when I'm dropping fresh strains, you can get inside information by
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.740]  joining my mailing list.
[10:10.740 --> 10:16.520]  If you would like to join the mailing list, simply send an email to iregeneticsmailinglist
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.960]  at gmail.com, and that will instantly add you to the mailing list.
[10:20.960 --> 10:24.640]  That way I can keep you updated if I add a new vendor, if I put something on sale,
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.960]  if I drop a new strain, or if I put out a coupon code for the new Feminized Seeds that
[10:28.960 --> 10:29.960]  are coming out.
[10:29.960 --> 10:33.840]  So join the mailing list, that way I can keep in touch and keep everybody updated on all
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.120]  of the great new stuff that is happening in the world of iRegenetics.
[10:38.120 --> 10:41.600]  All right, podcast world, I'm going to wrap up this 4th of July episode.
[10:41.600 --> 10:43.040]  Thanks for hanging out for a short episode.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.320]  I know it was short and sweet.
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.360]  It is a holiday.
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.680]  Put down your phone, put down your iPad, get off the computer, go out there, hang out with
[10:49.680 --> 10:54.320]  some people, join the barbecue, go blow some shit up, and enjoy a holiday.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back Monday with fresh new content and a full-length episode.
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.240]  I want to thank you again for listening to this quickie episode.
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.800]  I want to give a huge shout out to Benny's and the Veg, and until next time, take a fat
