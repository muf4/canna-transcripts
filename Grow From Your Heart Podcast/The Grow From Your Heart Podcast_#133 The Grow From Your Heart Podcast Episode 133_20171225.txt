[01:22.310 --> 01:25.390]  Miss Lindsey. How you doing today, honey? Pretty good. Sorry I introduced you right
[01:25.390 --> 01:28.550]  as you were about to take a drink, but it was the rhythm. It was just happening.
[01:28.550 --> 01:31.870]  I was feeling the flow. Alright, sitting to my left here is our good friend White Mike.
[01:31.870 --> 01:34.990]  How you doing, buddy? Doing well, man. What's up with you? I'm hanging out, taking some
[01:34.990 --> 01:39.750]  dabs, doing a podcast, loving life. Right, delicious, delicious hash. Trying to get the
[01:39.750 --> 01:42.710]  echo out of this show. I think I just fixed the echo. Sorry about the echo there,
[01:42.710 --> 01:45.110]  guys. I realized it was happening. I just could not figure out where the bugger was
[01:45.110 --> 01:51.190]  coming from. The echo's been solved. Alright, let's see. What do we talk about first? Oh,
[01:51.190 --> 01:55.550]  I'm proud to announce that this podcast is now available on TokRadio.com. I think the
[01:55.550 --> 02:02.390]  show airs on Wednesdays at 1 p.m. TokRadio.com. Make sure you check that out. Big shout out
[02:02.390 --> 02:08.470]  to Jay, Citizen Jay at TokRadio. I should verify what time that airs. I'm mostly sure
[02:08.470 --> 02:13.310]  that's Wednesdays at 1 p.m. You never know how it goes. I'll verify that by the end of
[02:13.310 --> 02:16.470]  the show. When you guys are talking, I will check an email that I got from Jay and we
[02:16.470 --> 02:20.230]  will make sure that I'm telling you the right time. We took a bunch of dabs. Did we shout
[02:20.230 --> 02:27.990]  out to Elevate? I'm pretty sure we did that. Yep, that happens. Alright, also, what else?
[02:27.990 --> 02:34.670]  Secret Sash. Yes. Secret Sash. Is it a secret if we talk about it here? I guess we just
[02:34.670 --> 02:39.430]  can't talk about the location, right? It's a secret. But Secret Sash, we would like you
[02:39.430 --> 02:43.070]  to join us. Lindsey will be there. I will be there. Mike, you gonna come to the Secret
[02:43.070 --> 02:46.870]  Sash, bro? It's entirely possible. White Mike might make an appearance. He doesn't make
[02:46.870 --> 02:51.070]  it to a lot of cannabis events because he is busy at city council fighting for the rights
[02:51.070 --> 02:56.150]  of Pueblo cannabis. Or lately, I'm just home with the kid. Yeah, shout out to the kid.
[02:56.150 --> 02:59.350]  I know a lot of podcast listeners, you're gonna have to deal with this one for a second.
[02:59.350 --> 03:04.190]  How's the kid, bro? He's doing good. Good. I just had another checkup today and all good.
[03:04.190 --> 03:08.670]  All right. There you go. Sorry. Sorry, listeners. Two seconds about the kid. I hope you guys
[03:08.670 --> 03:18.270]  could deal with that. Yeah, love for the kid. How's the wife, bro? No, I'm just kidding.
[03:18.270 --> 03:21.470]  Everything good at home? Yeah, doing well. Is the car running good? What can we say about
[03:21.470 --> 03:27.870]  the dogs? This just got fucking weird real quick. Secret Sash, you guys. May 19th. We
[03:27.870 --> 03:33.030]  hope you will be there. Make sure you check it out. Secret Sash underscore CO on Instagram.
[03:33.030 --> 03:37.190]  All of the information on how to get tickets, how to get VIP tickets, regular tickets. That's
[03:37.190 --> 03:43.110]  all there. Come party with us. Come take dabs with us. Come glob out. Some of the best shatter,
[03:43.110 --> 03:47.590]  some of the best live resin, some of the best wax, some of the best THC distillate. Not
[03:47.590 --> 03:53.390]  some of the best people. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I did meet one dude there
[03:53.390 --> 03:56.830]  that I wish I would have never met. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I always wanted
[03:56.830 --> 04:00.990]  every party. I mean, I'm in with that part. I don't even want to. There are a lot of cannabis
[04:00.990 --> 04:04.870]  in Colorado and there, I don't want to go to a lot of them, but this one's high on my
[04:04.870 --> 04:09.110]  list. Nice. Yeah. The last one was really sweet. I got to hang out with you all night
[04:09.110 --> 04:13.590]  actually Jeff. So that was, it worked out. Yeah. Uh, you can, you can retell the story
[04:13.590 --> 04:19.390]  that you told Mike about the dab I took. Oh, okay. So, uh, we shout out to, um, Mary's
[04:19.390 --> 04:24.630]  motivation on Instagram. Um, Brent, I got to meet him at a secret session. He had some
[04:24.630 --> 04:33.350]  of this, uh, THC distillate and, um, Jeff is a Wook and always takes such big dabs and
[04:33.350 --> 04:38.910]  he took a nice chunk glob of this, uh, THC distillate and you just watched his whole
[04:38.910 --> 04:45.070]  face change and that was it. He was like super stoned. I mean, don't get me wrong. Jeff was
[04:45.070 --> 04:49.590]  still dabbing. Jeff was still like, you know, smoking. It was a sesh. He's, he's not going
[04:49.590 --> 04:53.830]  to look like a wimp, but I mean like he, you could just see it all over his face that that
[04:53.870 --> 05:00.150]  dab changed his level for the whole night and like that was it. I kind of remember that
[05:00.150 --> 05:04.190]  dab. I remember being like, yeah, give me a fatty glob because I love some distal that
[05:04.190 --> 05:09.030]  you can pull the fattest. So we should kind of try to describe what distillate is. Uh,
[05:09.030 --> 05:14.350]  so they take CO2 hat they, and a hash maker will take CO2 hash hash that's made with CO2.
[05:14.550 --> 05:18.310]  Oftentimes it's kind of black and goopy. Sometimes it comes out kind of gold, but then
[05:18.510 --> 05:23.030]  they do what I think is fractal distillation is what I think it's called. And it, uh, it
[05:23.030 --> 05:26.150]  could be done with steam. It could be done. I'm not sure how a lot of the companies do
[05:26.150 --> 05:30.630]  it. All the companies have their own proprietary method, but they pretty much distill this
[05:30.630 --> 05:36.150]  product and they give you pure THC with terpenes put back in, or some of the companies
[05:36.150 --> 05:41.510]  actually put in, uh, terpenes that are purchased from other products that are derived
[05:41.510 --> 05:45.110]  from other products. But, uh, what this guy had was just pure cannabis with cannabis
[05:45.110 --> 05:48.990]  terpenes in it, cannabis terpenoids. And so it's all pure. It's just super pure. It's
[05:48.990 --> 05:55.470]  THC and terps and you can take the biggest freaking dabs and you don't choke. Yeah. My
[05:55.470 --> 05:59.830]  lungs felt like they got a little, little smoke in them. I was like, Oh yeah, my lungs got
[05:59.830 --> 06:04.110]  some smoke and I blew it out and there was a cloud like, and I was like, yeah, I'm not
[06:04.110 --> 06:07.590]  going to cough, but I could definitely feel, yeah, you could feel the face go a little
[06:08.670 --> 06:14.550]  bounce from white to red to white to red. Yeah. That's the usual Jeff. I love those
[06:14.590 --> 06:20.310]  dabs. Yeah. That raw THC distillate was just out of this world. Actually he gifted Chris
[06:20.310 --> 06:24.750]  and I that and the added terpenes one and Chris can't remember which terpene was added
[06:24.750 --> 06:30.030]  to it. And, uh, it was a good week that it was, it was a really good week. Good morning
[06:30.030 --> 06:36.870]  dabs were special. Woo. Uh, Mike brought over some strawberry banana dabs. We're going to
[06:36.870 --> 06:40.550]  have to dab that in a minute. That sounds super interesting. Yep. Some live resin I
[06:40.550 --> 06:44.470]  picked up the other day. Yeah. Nice. Is that from the, uh, the place of employment? Uh,
[06:44.470 --> 06:48.110]  yeah, I picked that up at work. It's a botanical product though. Nice. Shout out to
[06:48.110 --> 06:52.790]  botanical. Yeah. They make some tasty stuff. I like the new Turpex packaging. That's
[06:52.790 --> 06:56.950]  pretty rad. Yeah. Love their new packaging. Secret Sash May 19th. I don't know if we
[06:56.950 --> 06:59.910]  finished that part up, but I take dabs at secret session. I hope you come take dabs
[06:59.910 --> 07:04.430]  with us. All right. So we're going to talk about a couple of things here. Uh, Mike and
[07:04.430 --> 07:07.630]  I and Lindsey, Mike and I have lived here for a long ass time. We've seen this cannabis
[07:07.630 --> 07:11.230]  industry change. Uh, we thought all the, uh, the raids and all the cannabis shit has
[07:11.230 --> 07:14.310]  gone away. Lindsey's been here for a while. She hasn't seen any cannabis trouble in the
[07:14.310 --> 07:18.830]  time that she's been here. Nope. And then in the past, how many weeks, Mike? It's seven,
[07:18.870 --> 07:24.990]  seven weeks. How many raids? Uh, 18 now, 18 raids in seven weeks. And they're all,
[07:24.990 --> 07:29.070]  they're not like stores or, or licensed facilities or anything. They're private grows
[07:29.070 --> 07:34.710]  that are, um, uh, way over their legal plant count way over their legal plant count. I
[07:34.750 --> 07:38.670]  saw him pulling a whole bunch of plants out of one guy's garage on the news. The, um,
[07:39.030 --> 07:43.630]  though the number 18 only had like 50 plants, but a couple of them before that were in
[07:43.630 --> 07:49.510]  the, the several hundred or, um, like 1200, 1500 there. Uh, I read somewhere that a
[07:49.510 --> 07:54.510]  lot of these grows are connected. Um, there was another set of raids up in spring.
[07:54.510 --> 07:58.510]  So this 18 doesn't count that we're all connected in like El Paso and Denver
[07:58.510 --> 08:03.350]  County. Um, our laws didn't change the black market anywhere else.
[08:04.030 --> 08:07.590]  And so there's still a bunch of black market growers that are sitting around all
[08:07.590 --> 08:11.870]  winter going, where's the place where I think I can hide and no one will notice me
[08:11.870 --> 08:15.950]  growing marijuana. And apparently like if you're sitting in Florida all winter
[08:15.950 --> 08:17.790]  thinking that the answer is Colorado,
[08:17.790 --> 08:20.630]  because there's a shitload of people from Florida getting busted growing a shit
[08:20.630 --> 08:24.070]  load of plants here. Yeah. Most of the raids happened to people. Yeah.
[08:24.070 --> 08:26.790]  They happen to be people. Yeah. So where are you from over there? Miss Lindsey,
[08:26.910 --> 08:30.670]  miss the traveling stoner. I was born in Jersey. So I guess I'll claim that today.
[08:31.790 --> 08:35.150]  I don't ever claim that. Like I never tell people I'm from Jersey.
[08:35.470 --> 08:38.590]  I will claim Florida over Jersey any day, but not in those conversations.
[08:38.630 --> 08:41.990]  I've made a couple of friends that are recent arrivals in Colorado,
[08:41.990 --> 08:45.350]  like over the last year and a half or so from Florida. And I've told all of them,
[08:45.350 --> 08:46.470]  like, yo, if you're growing weed,
[08:46.870 --> 08:50.550]  make sure your plant count is spot the fuck on because it's only a matter of
[08:50.550 --> 08:53.230]  time before our sheriff knocks on your door and is like, I hear you're from
[08:53.230 --> 08:55.750]  Florida. Can I see your basement?
[08:58.350 --> 08:59.630]  Is it that easy? Can they just knock?
[08:59.870 --> 09:02.950]  Well, there's a couple of things that work here. Like, um,
[09:03.470 --> 09:08.350]  all the bus are in the same area. And if you ask me, um,
[09:08.830 --> 09:11.190]  because all the, the press stories all say the same thing.
[09:11.190 --> 09:15.590]  A citizen complaint was called in. The sheriffs went out to check, confirmed,
[09:16.350 --> 09:19.030]  um, the suspicion that there was marijuana being grown there,
[09:19.030 --> 09:22.670]  check the plant counts found a shitload of plants and no paperwork.
[09:23.270 --> 09:25.670]  And arrested the recent arrival from Florida.
[09:26.070 --> 09:30.510]  Like there's like 18 grows and like 15 of them match that exact, um, layout.
[09:31.110 --> 09:33.670]  And so I think it's the anti-pop people that have that,
[09:33.750 --> 09:35.430]  that are working on that ballot initiative.
[09:35.430 --> 09:37.070]  Most of them live out in Pueblo West.
[09:37.510 --> 09:40.990]  I think they're just driving around looking at new house or looking at houses
[09:40.990 --> 09:43.790]  for, uh, vents and the stink of weed.
[09:44.470 --> 09:47.710]  And they're just calling on everything they find. Um,
[09:47.750 --> 09:51.030]  they're not reporting on all the grows that are perfectly legal where they
[09:51.030 --> 09:53.910]  knock on the door and the dude's like, I totally grow marijuana here.
[09:53.910 --> 09:55.110]  It's a hundred percent legal.
[09:55.430 --> 09:59.030]  I have blank number of plants and X number of paperwork sheets.
[09:59.510 --> 10:02.990]  Here's everything to confirm what I'm legally allowed to have. Come take a look.
[10:02.990 --> 10:07.510]  Here's what's I've got. You can confirm it's all correct. Have a nice day.
[10:08.190 --> 10:09.190]  They just turn around and leave.
[10:09.350 --> 10:11.630]  Yeah. Having a small grow isn't a big deal right now.
[10:11.750 --> 10:14.190]  No. Having a legal grow isn't an issue at all.
[10:14.190 --> 10:17.590]  They're not messing with the businesses. They're not. Um,
[10:17.630 --> 10:20.270]  cause that happens in a lot of states. Um,
[10:20.310 --> 10:23.590]  it's just the home grows that are way out of compliance with our law.
[10:23.630 --> 10:26.070]  Do you think they're using electricity bills to find?
[10:26.710 --> 10:29.350]  That's what I was just going to say. I was just like, yep.
[10:29.390 --> 10:32.430]  I was going to say they're looking at that. They have a lot of angles,
[10:32.430 --> 10:35.390]  but at the end of the day, what it comes down to is that if you come out here,
[10:35.670 --> 10:38.230]  please do it legally, get the paperwork.
[10:38.390 --> 10:41.950]  I have listened to so many podcasts of you to stay here and say,
[10:42.270 --> 10:45.230]  do it the right way. Stop, you know, stop trying to,
[10:45.310 --> 10:47.510]  you're making our community look bad.
[10:47.510 --> 10:51.950]  You're making us look like we're trying to break the laws and trying to get away
[10:51.950 --> 10:55.030]  with this. None of us in the community are trying to,
[10:55.310 --> 10:58.870]  I have not started growing yet since I have come out here because my paperwork
[10:58.870 --> 11:03.230]  is not in order yet. I'd love to be growing. I'd love to have a whole, you know,
[11:03.230 --> 11:06.590]  two rooms going, but it's not going to happen. Right?
[11:07.030 --> 11:11.310]  Like I need to get my paperwork in line first and I can grow six legally as a
[11:11.310 --> 11:12.630]  Colorado resident.
[11:13.030 --> 11:13.950]  I can't be a hypocrite.
[11:13.950 --> 11:17.070]  I know there was a time where I was moving and shaking and doing shit that
[11:17.070 --> 11:18.910]  should not be spoken of on a podcast.
[11:19.950 --> 11:23.830]  But we've told some hypothetical stories of my past. Uh, so if you're,
[11:23.830 --> 11:26.270]  if you are hustling on the black market, doing your thing, we're not a hater.
[11:26.310 --> 11:28.830]  We're not mad at you. You got to do your thing, do what you got to do.
[11:29.110 --> 11:30.910]  But eventually there's going to come a time when you,
[11:30.910 --> 11:33.870]  when you got to start thinking about shifting to the legal market.
[11:34.550 --> 11:38.990]  There's a difference between making money to survive and being greedy and having
[11:38.990 --> 11:42.670]  these huge grows that these people are getting busted for. And that's the issue.
[11:42.670 --> 11:46.990]  It's, it's these huge commercial grows in houses for no reason.
[11:46.990 --> 11:50.750]  Like you're all going to go and sell that in another, well, you know,
[11:51.070 --> 11:54.350]  like, I mean, if you really think about it, it's just so stupid.
[11:54.350 --> 11:58.710]  Like this is why they were in the national parks 10 years ago. Um,
[11:59.230 --> 12:02.510]  and they hide anywhere they think they can hide. It's,
[12:02.950 --> 12:06.270]  and they're trying to hide in Colorado. They just,
[12:06.790 --> 12:10.750]  they don't realize how well publicized the rules are have been here because
[12:10.750 --> 12:14.830]  they're not publicized anywhere else. Like New Mexico, Florida, Kansas,
[12:14.830 --> 12:19.670]  none of these places care about what the zoning rules are for the shops or what
[12:19.670 --> 12:22.150]  the home grow rules are in each city and County.
[12:22.430 --> 12:23.790]  So none of that shit makes the paper.
[12:23.790 --> 12:26.830]  It just says weeds legal and they're allowed to grow their own house strange.
[12:27.430 --> 12:30.950]  And so they think, Oh, I can move to Colorado. I can go to the grow store.
[12:30.950 --> 12:35.910]  I can throw down the 18 grand or whatever I've managed to save up on grow
[12:35.950 --> 12:39.990]  equipment, rent a house, um, pull a crop or two,
[12:39.990 --> 12:43.550]  drive it all back to Florida and bam, I've got 400 grand.
[12:44.150 --> 12:48.110]  And they just don't see how insane that plan is. Um,
[12:48.150 --> 12:51.030]  like the grow store is going to sell you all that shit. No problem.
[12:51.070 --> 12:53.630]  But the, when you plug it all in,
[12:53.630 --> 12:56.630]  you're going to have to have the power company come out by the time the power
[12:56.630 --> 12:57.950]  company's done upgrading you,
[12:57.950 --> 13:00.390]  all your neighbors want to know what the fuck you're doing.
[13:00.910 --> 13:04.110]  As soon as it smells like weed, which is going to be about, Ooh,
[13:04.110 --> 13:06.310]  what eight weeks later? Um,
[13:06.350 --> 13:08.870]  one of them is going to call the sheriff and go, would you knock on this box?
[13:08.870 --> 13:13.030]  Door? Yeah. He had some guy building some shit there. They did new electricity,
[13:13.390 --> 13:15.510]  watch them carrying a bunch of shit. Now it reeks.
[13:15.510 --> 13:18.230]  I'm pretty sure he's got an illegal operation. Yeah.
[13:18.310 --> 13:21.430]  And this is all assuming you don't have a landlord that's going to be checking
[13:21.430 --> 13:23.750]  on everything and all of that jazz as well.
[13:23.990 --> 13:27.270]  A couple of these guys were like, just showed up, rented a house,
[13:27.390 --> 13:30.950]  went to bought some ply board and started ply boarding over exterior windows.
[13:31.670 --> 13:34.630]  Um, like one dude had a pit bull chain to a window. Well,
[13:35.390 --> 13:40.310]  like these are idiots of in the most extreme sense. Um,
[13:40.430 --> 13:43.390]  because I mean, if you think about it, you could move here,
[13:43.910 --> 13:47.910]  grow even your six plant, just being here as an adult limit.
[13:48.670 --> 13:52.990]  And if you were dumb enough to take the risk to move that back to Florida,
[13:52.990 --> 13:57.990]  just that smaller harvest, you could still make a fair living.
[13:58.550 --> 14:00.190]  Like it wouldn't be extravagant.
[14:00.190 --> 14:04.390]  You wouldn't be rolling back and forth in a brand new escalade. But I mean,
[14:04.390 --> 14:07.470]  you could make enough to pay your rent and pay your bills,
[14:07.870 --> 14:10.910]  but they're trying to do hundreds of plants because they're stupid and greedy
[14:11.350 --> 14:14.510]  and they think no one's going to notice here. And it's, that's just so insane.
[14:15.350 --> 14:16.470]  Like it's a neighborhood.
[14:17.590 --> 14:20.110]  If even if you do get it harvested and dried and cured,
[14:20.110 --> 14:22.030]  you're going to get pulled the fuck over as soon as you cross it.
[14:22.470 --> 14:27.190]  A couple of them got busted halfway to where they were headed because they just,
[14:27.510 --> 14:30.430]  the turn signal violation, hundreds of pounds of weed in the car,
[14:30.430 --> 14:33.390]  smells like hundreds of pounds of weed in the car. Um,
[14:33.590 --> 14:36.910]  y'all know how bad your quarter out stinks on the way home from picking it up.
[14:37.470 --> 14:40.070]  Like magnify that by a hundred pounds.
[14:40.150 --> 14:44.230]  Yeah. Because you guys aren't being smart and vacuum sealing it and like doing it
[14:44.230 --> 14:44.830]  the right way.
[14:44.830 --> 14:47.990]  You're just putting it in trash bags and throwing it in the back and praying to
[14:47.990 --> 14:48.830]  God you'll make it there.
[14:48.830 --> 14:51.950]  Trash bags is the gangster way to carry some. Don't you know that?
[14:51.950 --> 14:54.350]  That's the way to get two of the hefties
[14:54.470 --> 14:55.310]  right?
[14:56.510 --> 14:58.310]  Double bag that shit. Oh, you'd be fine.
[14:58.350 --> 15:00.990]  You remember my little, my little friend that's not real tall.
[15:00.990 --> 15:03.790]  He used to give me the trash bag, the clear trash bags full. Yeah.
[15:03.830 --> 15:07.830]  Back in the day that hypothetically happened. Remember that allegedly? Yeah.
[15:09.110 --> 15:11.630]  Those were good days. It's just insane.
[15:12.030 --> 15:13.910]  The days of coming up and growing big,
[15:13.910 --> 15:17.110]  ridiculous amounts of cannabis in Colorado, maybe coming to an end here.
[15:17.150 --> 15:19.670]  It's still possible if you're going, Oh, you gotta be smart about it.
[15:20.150 --> 15:21.310]  But be careful you guys,
[15:21.310 --> 15:23.470]  if you're going to come here from another state and think you're going to set up
[15:23.470 --> 15:26.910]  a shop, read the rules, get, get really familiar with the rules. Be careful.
[15:27.030 --> 15:29.590]  The two parts of this that pissed me off the most is like a,
[15:29.590 --> 15:34.590]  now we got to pay to send these fucks to jail and B they're fucking up our
[15:34.710 --> 15:39.710]  reputation and they're giving a whole bunch of fire to the anti-pop people and
[15:40.070 --> 15:44.430]  they didn't need to fire. They, uh, they've lost two years in a row.
[15:44.430 --> 15:48.390]  Every time they spoke up, they got told fuck off and uh,
[15:48.430 --> 15:51.630]  they're really, really angry. They don't need fuel for that fire. Yeah.
[15:51.670 --> 15:54.110]  They have 18 bus in seven weeks.
[15:54.110 --> 15:58.750]  Like a lot of fuels in every single one of them was out in Pueblo West
[15:58.750 --> 16:02.030]  basically. Um, I mean, you've lived here for how long?
[16:02.030 --> 16:05.070]  Pueblo doesn't report shit. Um,
[16:05.750 --> 16:10.710]  and all of a sudden we've got 18 successful pot grow tips in seven weeks.
[16:12.230 --> 16:15.230]  Like there's some weird shit going on right now and people didn't see it coming.
[16:17.550 --> 16:19.150]  So if you're growing in Pueblo, be careful.
[16:19.430 --> 16:23.230]  Yeah. Get your plan count in order. That's Colorado wide right now.
[16:23.230 --> 16:26.390]  Like gearing up for the election. We've got a new president coming in.
[16:27.430 --> 16:29.350]  Everywhere. If you're growing everywhere, if you're growing,
[16:29.350 --> 16:31.790]  get your shit cleaned up. Now's a good time to think about it. If you,
[16:32.030 --> 16:35.270]  if you're a medical marijuana grower, uh, if you've got a plant count,
[16:35.630 --> 16:36.910]  go count your fucking plants.
[16:36.950 --> 16:40.270]  Go consider like go get one under your plant count so that if some shit goes
[16:40.270 --> 16:43.030]  wrong and you break off a branch and it looks like an extra plan on accident,
[16:43.470 --> 16:45.390]  uh, go check your gram weight, uh,
[16:45.550 --> 16:48.590]  get to your perfect gram weight and then roll up a fat joint and smoke it.
[16:48.590 --> 16:50.670]  So you're a fat joint underneath your gram limit.
[16:51.470 --> 16:53.870]  I just go get your shit in order. Mike looked at me like that's,
[16:53.910 --> 16:56.790]  that's a really good, I had that thought the other day. I was,
[16:56.830 --> 17:00.070]  I've got a nice hash pile going right now. And I was like, Hmm,
[17:00.750 --> 17:03.350]  like I can't even take this. Like when I move,
[17:03.350 --> 17:06.910]  technically I'll have to break the law moving this from house one to house two,
[17:06.910 --> 17:09.190]  because I'm not supposed to have that much shit out in the world.
[17:09.910 --> 17:11.550]  I'm over my gram limit.
[17:13.430 --> 17:14.990]  Wait, how much weight you've got to,
[17:15.510 --> 17:18.230]  can we talk about your extended plant count and your medical marijuana card?
[17:18.270 --> 17:19.070]  Can we talk about that?
[17:19.910 --> 17:23.270]  But just theoretically just for the legal rules. Cause at the same time,
[17:23.270 --> 17:25.670]  I was thinking about needing to go get my card again.
[17:25.670 --> 17:29.830]  Like a lot of the supplies to us too. Like we're not special. Right. Um,
[17:29.870 --> 17:34.870]  we've got deadlines to reapply and dates to follow and card caps to adhere to.
[17:35.230 --> 17:38.470]  Yeah, we do. Yes. I gotta go. I get to go. I get to go.
[17:38.470 --> 17:42.790]  Should I get my doctor, my MMJ doctor, a shout out? Uh, I get to go. No,
[17:42.870 --> 17:46.710]  he dude, he would do fucking line is long enough. That's true. That is true.
[17:47.270 --> 17:49.830]  Sorry guys. Mike just made a really good find your own.
[17:49.870 --> 17:51.790]  It takes like four weeks to get into the fucking dude.
[17:52.510 --> 17:56.630]  I've got to go May 19th to go renew my shit. Will you give me his number?
[17:57.830 --> 18:00.670]  Thanks. I just really wanted to make them all feel bad.
[18:01.670 --> 18:04.710]  He's a few blocks from the office. I don't mind giving it to one or two people,
[18:04.710 --> 18:08.550]  but don't shout it out. I just, I was just trying to prove a point. It's okay.
[18:09.470 --> 18:11.110]  Oh, Bruce needs some business.
[18:12.670 --> 18:15.430]  All right. Shout out to the same one up here, down there. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:15.430 --> 18:17.990]  Oh, you, you catch him on his Springs day. Yeah.
[18:17.990 --> 18:21.070]  He's in Springs like four days a week now and he's in Pueblo one day a week.
[18:21.070 --> 18:24.590]  So shout out to my MMJ doctor. He knows, he knows my conditions.
[18:24.590 --> 18:26.750]  He knows me well. When I walk in, he just starts writing. He goes,
[18:26.750 --> 18:29.190]  good to see you. What's this? Like the 10th time. And I'm like, yep.
[18:29.230 --> 18:30.590]  10 years in a row, buddy. Good to see you.
[18:32.590 --> 18:36.070]  I've been a medical marijuana patient for probably close to 10 years.
[18:36.070 --> 18:39.430]  I'd say Mike's thinking back. Mike's got a better,
[18:39.870 --> 18:44.230]  I have a seven or eight for sure. I don't think we've got a decade yet. All right.
[18:44.550 --> 18:47.590]  Uh, did you guys go and get them together for the first time?
[18:47.670 --> 18:51.950]  Around similar time? It was the same, same year within a year.
[18:51.950 --> 18:56.590]  So you had one before me. Yeah, I was running a shop and that's right.
[18:56.630 --> 19:01.630]  He came in as a patient with one with another patient and we got along.
[19:03.190 --> 19:05.510]  Yep. It was love at first sight.
[19:07.510 --> 19:10.550]  I miss those days. It was insane. That place was fun. All right.
[19:10.550 --> 19:13.030]  We're reminiscing all chatterbox. You know, it's good.
[19:13.030 --> 19:15.270]  People like hearing insight to our lives.
[19:15.910 --> 19:18.950]  They really do because like guys like Seb, shout out to Ross to Seb.
[19:20.230 --> 19:23.990]  They don't get to sit around and be on a podcast and take dabs and live the life
[19:23.990 --> 19:26.510]  that we get to live. They got to fucking dodge ostriches.
[19:26.550 --> 19:29.310]  What does that fucking thing? He said, almost ran over. Was it an emu?
[19:30.070 --> 19:32.830]  Whatever that thing was said, what was that thing? Tell me, bro.
[19:33.990 --> 19:34.750]  Posted a video.
[19:34.750 --> 19:39.750]  He was driving in Australia and a giant long legged bird.
[19:40.310 --> 19:43.310]  It looked like an ostrich, but maybe, maybe it could have been.
[19:43.350 --> 19:45.510]  That's what I thought. I guessed, but it could have been an emu.
[19:45.550 --> 19:45.750]  Right.
[19:45.750 --> 19:49.150]  Maybe for that work of the video camera while you're driving, bro.
[19:49.150 --> 19:51.030]  Come on. Giant running birds. We use it.
[19:51.710 --> 19:55.430]  It's 2016. Everyone's got a dash cam of some sort going on.
[19:55.430 --> 19:58.310]  Everyone's periscoping, Snapchatting something. Don't judge the dude.
[19:58.310 --> 20:01.270]  He lives in Australia. I'm just, I'm just messing with Seb. Actually.
[20:01.830 --> 20:04.310]  Actually said, well, you're in Australia. Everything is trying to kill you.
[20:04.310 --> 20:05.950]  Put the phone down and pay the fuck attention.
[20:06.390 --> 20:08.190]  Everything in Australia wants to kill you.
[20:08.230 --> 20:09.350]  Before I said that, I was like,
[20:09.350 --> 20:13.830]  I wonder if it's kind of like Russia where everyone has a camera on mounted on
[20:13.830 --> 20:17.390]  their dashboard and an M 16. Yeah. It could be for different reasons.
[20:17.390 --> 20:20.710]  Like there it's because the odds that someone gets out and mugs use really high.
[20:20.750 --> 20:25.590]  They use AKs over there. Um, wow. Hi, how about you guys?
[20:28.550 --> 20:31.310]  I want to give a big shout out to my friends over at elevate glass and the
[20:31.310 --> 20:34.510]  lovely ladies and the one gentleman that run the place over at elevate glass.
[20:34.510 --> 20:37.710]  And also my good friends at hemp higher elevation masterpiece productions.
[20:37.990 --> 20:40.590]  Make sure you guys check out the showroom. It's a elevate glass.
[20:40.590 --> 20:44.390]  It's five 17 South Tahon and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Uh,
[20:44.430 --> 20:47.950]  make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent you. Please do that. Uh,
[20:48.030 --> 20:51.990]  I've got a brand new recycler rig here, uh, with the brand new banger on it.
[20:52.590 --> 20:54.830]  And I feel that just to the perfect level. And you can,
[20:55.310 --> 20:58.430]  you can really pull so hard and you don't get water in your face and you get a
[20:58.430 --> 21:02.910]  big fat globby dad. And I'm like, it's nice. It does. It does. It does.
[21:03.310 --> 21:05.230]  All right. So, um, Mike,
[21:05.230 --> 21:08.030]  you were talking about some political stuff is why we've got you here.
[21:08.350 --> 21:11.470]  Oh, it's a, just the one thing I wanted to throw in right now is, uh,
[21:12.030 --> 21:17.030]  a lot of people are focused on the November election as they should be. Um,
[21:17.190 --> 21:20.390]  yay for paying attention. Good for you. Um, but
[21:23.070 --> 21:26.310]  I listened to a podcast the other night where he was like really mean to the
[21:26.310 --> 21:27.470]  listeners and you were like, damn.
[21:28.310 --> 21:29.150]  Um,
[21:31.150 --> 21:35.350]  uh, but there's a primary elections too in everybody's area in these matter.
[21:35.430 --> 21:38.710]  And no one ever turns out for these. Um,
[21:39.190 --> 21:41.830]  the example down here is this November.
[21:41.830 --> 21:46.470]  We might be voting to ban the recreational marijuana industry. However,
[21:46.950 --> 21:51.950]  before we even get to that vote possibly happening, there'll be election,
[21:52.110 --> 21:56.670]  an election, um, a primary election that, sorry about that space, the word,
[21:57.270 --> 21:58.910]  uh, a primary election down here.
[21:58.910 --> 22:03.070]  We'll reelect people like city councilman and County commissioners and the local
[22:03.070 --> 22:03.910]  judge.
[22:04.350 --> 22:08.630]  And maybe there'll be a couple of small local issues they get handled like city
[22:08.630 --> 22:12.430]  or County. Why? What are you going to run for? Um, nothing this round,
[22:12.750 --> 22:17.750]  but, uh, if two people down here happen to get elected instead of the two people
[22:18.030 --> 22:21.150]  that currently have this job getting reelected, um,
[22:21.150 --> 22:22.950]  retail marijuana could go away anyway,
[22:22.950 --> 22:27.110]  because the number of pro and anti-marijuana votes would swing that far with
[22:27.110 --> 22:30.470]  just two people getting swapped out. Um,
[22:30.510 --> 22:35.510]  so there's a lot going on politically in everyone's area that they need to be
[22:36.230 --> 22:37.670]  paying attention to right now.
[22:37.750 --> 22:42.030]  And right now is the time to go find out if you're registered to vote,
[22:42.510 --> 22:46.390]  go find out how that works in your area in Colorado. It's awesome.
[22:46.390 --> 22:48.510]  They just mail it to your house. You don't have to do anything,
[22:48.510 --> 22:51.670]  but check the mail. When it shows up, you fill it out,
[22:52.030 --> 22:53.590]  you take it to a drop off point.
[22:53.590 --> 22:56.910]  You get the sticker that says I voted and you get to be awesome for like the
[22:56.910 --> 23:01.670]  whole next year. It's really that simple. And other places, it's a little harder.
[23:01.670 --> 23:05.550]  You got to go stand in line, but do it like figure out how to do it.
[23:05.590 --> 23:08.710]  Now's the time to figure out how to do it. I know it's not till November.
[23:08.710 --> 23:11.830]  I know that's a long time away. I know a lot of you are like,
[23:11.830 --> 23:15.910]  I just planted my outdoor fuck off. Like after harvest,
[23:15.910 --> 23:18.910]  I'll figure out how to run it. Well, no,
[23:18.910 --> 23:20.390]  that's what a lot of people think right now.
[23:20.390 --> 23:23.910]  Like the election's not till November. Why pay attention? I'm not saying,
[23:24.310 --> 23:27.390]  I'm not telling them to fuck off. I'm telling them that I'm thinking there's,
[23:28.110 --> 23:31.150]  they don't want to pay attention to politics yet because that's just months and
[23:31.150 --> 23:35.190]  months away. Like, but now's the time to get registered.
[23:35.190 --> 23:38.790]  Now's the time to start paying attention to what's going on in your area and
[23:38.790 --> 23:42.230]  start making sure you've done what you need to do to actually vote.
[23:44.070 --> 23:45.750]  I'm sick of the marijuana community.
[23:45.750 --> 23:48.230]  Just being a non-existent entity politically.
[23:48.750 --> 23:50.950]  Like we outnumber Christians.
[23:51.750 --> 23:55.910]  Think about the number of Christians that annoy you constantly because they're
[23:55.910 --> 23:57.030]  doing shit politically.
[23:57.710 --> 24:01.030]  Think about how powerful that particular group of people is in the United States.
[24:01.070 --> 24:05.470]  We outnumber NRA members by five times.
[24:06.950 --> 24:10.790]  And that's just the DEA's estimate for how many people smoke pot in the U S
[24:10.870 --> 24:14.430]  that are more pot smokers than gun toters. Yup. Wow.
[24:15.430 --> 24:19.270]  Shout out to all of us. We don't matter at all politically. Why?
[24:19.270 --> 24:20.630]  Because we don't show up.
[24:20.750 --> 24:23.350]  I got no hatred for anybody with a gun. If I said that condescendingly,
[24:23.350 --> 24:25.590]  I apologize. I don't respect anybody that carries a firearm.
[24:25.590 --> 24:30.070]  When you think about how much influence the NRA wields and then you look up the
[24:30.070 --> 24:33.350]  actual number of NRA members and their actual operating budget,
[24:33.910 --> 24:37.790]  it's terrifying how a group that small can be that influential.
[24:38.150 --> 24:42.950]  If we were just to get a little bit organized or at least just all show up on
[24:43.070 --> 24:48.070]  election day, we could have a serious authority coast to coast,
[24:48.750 --> 24:52.510]  but we don't. And we definitely, those of us that do show up,
[24:52.510 --> 24:57.070]  don't show up unified even a little bit. And I'm, yeah,
[24:57.230 --> 25:00.110]  I'm pushing your listeners. Get out, get out, start voting.
[25:00.150 --> 25:03.030]  We need, so we all, we all will take a party bus anywhere.
[25:03.030 --> 25:07.030]  If you put a dab rig on a bus and a bong on a bus, right.
[25:07.070 --> 25:09.470]  Put some Rasta man with dreadlocks and some reggae music,
[25:09.910 --> 25:11.950]  Rasta man driving it, reggae music playing real loud.
[25:11.950 --> 25:14.870]  And you paint a red, gold and green people get on there and smoke some hash and
[25:14.870 --> 25:18.350]  smoke some joints and have a good ass social time. Let's,
[25:18.910 --> 25:22.870]  let's get one of those and pick up stoners and drive them to polling places to
[25:22.870 --> 25:23.710]  get them to vote.
[25:24.030 --> 25:26.550]  It's not an unheard of idea.
[25:27.030 --> 25:31.470]  I'm hoping a couple of the industry players do something similar.
[25:31.750 --> 25:33.350]  Yeah. Somebody, somebody, uh,
[25:33.390 --> 25:37.830]  that doesn't work a lot and have a podcast and drive too much already helped me
[25:37.830 --> 25:40.030]  out with this, uh, put together like some buses to go.
[25:40.070 --> 25:42.030]  You like to show an owner of business.
[25:42.790 --> 25:45.750]  Is this real? Can you do this? Get a bus and drive people.
[25:45.750 --> 25:49.550]  I think that somewhere like Denver that would totally fly.
[25:49.630 --> 25:53.310]  I think some thing like Pueblo that might not.
[25:53.350 --> 25:55.470]  The token get away with driving them,
[25:56.430 --> 26:00.950]  smoking them out while you drive them requires a lot of extra insurance and a
[26:00.950 --> 26:03.950]  much, much larger vehicle. But every election,
[26:03.950 --> 26:07.910]  there's groups that grab vans and go bus seniors and other people that love to
[26:07.910 --> 26:11.150]  vote and have trouble sometimes getting to the polling station and taking the
[26:11.150 --> 26:14.550]  seniors, but often vote though, whatever way they want them to vote.
[26:14.550 --> 26:16.350]  Like they'll go round up those people and take them.
[26:17.030 --> 26:19.030]  Free joint. If you, uh, if you vote,
[26:19.510 --> 26:21.550]  I think that you can't give stuff away. That's illegal.
[26:21.550 --> 26:24.550]  There's lots of little rules like that. Yeah, that's cheating.
[26:26.430 --> 26:29.670]  But just giving them a ride that's helping someone perform their civic duty.
[26:30.630 --> 26:33.990]  Um, I'd love to see someone get in legal trouble for that.
[26:33.990 --> 26:37.750]  That'd be an awesome court case. Um, but yeah,
[26:38.150 --> 26:40.310]  get involved, start Googling after the show.
[26:41.110 --> 26:43.470]  You could do it right now while you listen. If you're at work,
[26:43.510 --> 26:46.750]  you could in your cubicle, the bosses are behind you.
[26:46.750 --> 26:48.790]  And just fucking go and start Googling. Like,
[26:50.150 --> 26:52.430]  you just wanted to know what election day was.
[26:52.430 --> 26:56.310]  So you could think about requesting it off because civic pride is important to
[26:56.310 --> 26:58.190]  you. Or if you're at work, just go to the bathroom.
[26:58.230 --> 27:00.830]  Actually could take in a dump, Google that shit.
[27:01.310 --> 27:02.830]  Come back out and tell all of your friends about it.
[27:03.830 --> 27:05.990]  Lindsay, you're blushing like a motherfucker.
[27:09.230 --> 27:10.070]  That's a good one.
[27:12.790 --> 27:13.830]  Sometimes, you know, you know,
[27:13.830 --> 27:15.990]  you've gotten there and taken like a seven minute pee just cause you're in
[27:15.990 --> 27:19.870]  there checking Instagram. Do you know how big that, that place is?
[27:19.910 --> 27:24.630]  That's like not even a liable way to hide, like viable, not liable.
[27:24.630 --> 27:26.390]  They can hear you double tap when you like something.
[27:27.950 --> 27:29.990]  You could like drop a pin in there and they'd hear that.
[27:30.350 --> 27:31.270]  This got weird again.
[27:33.190 --> 27:36.030]  I think something that Mike said on the last podcast though,
[27:36.030 --> 27:37.750]  that's really important to say again though,
[27:37.750 --> 27:40.990]  is that a lot of people this year are up for reelection.
[27:40.990 --> 27:44.310]  And if we get the right people in the right seats,
[27:44.670 --> 27:48.750]  we could be looking at this moving a lot faster than we really thought it was
[27:48.750 --> 27:53.510]  going to. We're already at the breaking point. We're at 24 or 25,
[27:53.510 --> 27:54.790]  including, including
[27:54.790 --> 27:57.990]  24 medical. It looks like it's going to be 25 here in a minute.
[27:58.070 --> 28:00.670]  But does that count Pennsylvania since Pennsylvania is legalized?
[28:00.670 --> 28:02.030]  Pennsylvania is 24 I believe.
[28:02.510 --> 28:05.870]  Okay. So 24 plus DC. So we're still looking at 25. We're,
[28:05.950 --> 28:08.230]  we're at the halfway mark where, you know,
[28:08.270 --> 28:10.670]  and it's funny cause my dad said something really interesting to me the other
[28:10.670 --> 28:14.550]  day that, um, at this point in, um, uh,
[28:14.590 --> 28:18.110]  gay marriage it had already steamrolled and it went across all 50.
[28:19.470 --> 28:21.990]  So maybe we just have to hold on for a little bit longer.
[28:21.990 --> 28:24.550]  Guess who showed up in big groups and voted
[28:25.350 --> 28:28.190]  the gay.
[28:30.790 --> 28:32.070]  You win yourself a tasty dab.
[28:33.910 --> 28:35.990]  I knew, but I didn't, I didn't know the appropriate way to answer.
[28:38.190 --> 28:39.910]  Shout out to shout out to my sisters.
[28:39.910 --> 28:41.670]  Cause I left that up to you.
[28:43.470 --> 28:45.110]  I have a lot of fun checking out chicks with Lindsay.
[28:45.750 --> 28:50.390]  That's definitely a fun thing to do. No, no. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[28:50.430 --> 28:53.150]  You're blushing before you can blush more. Who cares? Keep blushing.
[28:53.150 --> 28:56.030]  They can't see it on the show. You're just going to tell them about it.
[28:57.070 --> 29:00.830]  I mean, we don't, we don't shy. Anybody that listens is our friend.
[29:02.950 --> 29:05.710]  Yeah. I know I yell at you a lot. I just want to motivate you. Yeah.
[29:05.710 --> 29:07.630]  Mike doesn't mean to, to, to be a, no,
[29:07.630 --> 29:10.870]  Mike does mean to be motivating and inspiring. He wants you to go out and vote.
[29:11.430 --> 29:15.750]  There is a chance that we could lose recreational cannabis in Pueblo, Colorado.
[29:16.550 --> 29:17.710]  Well, that's tremendous.
[29:17.750 --> 29:21.790]  Politics and public opinion work on a pendulum. If you look at your history,
[29:22.230 --> 29:25.630]  we swing from liberal to conservative socially.
[29:26.270 --> 29:30.750]  And so social issues like this can swing back quickly.
[29:31.230 --> 29:32.830]  In the early seventies,
[29:32.990 --> 29:36.950]  we had a president that was thinking about legalizing marijuana nationally.
[29:37.510 --> 29:40.710]  We had a number of States that had passed medical marijuana laws.
[29:41.270 --> 29:44.150]  Does anybody remember these when we were children? No.
[29:44.350 --> 29:48.150]  Cause the fucking eighties happened and public opinion swung back the other way
[29:48.150 --> 29:51.470]  hard. We decided to do a war on drugs instead of legalization.
[29:51.470 --> 29:56.470]  We all know how that played out and had a couple of candidates stayed in the
[29:57.790 --> 30:01.910]  election or done better. I'm running up to this point.
[30:02.230 --> 30:06.070]  We could still have candidates that were promising to send the military to stop
[30:06.090 --> 30:07.550]  Colorado's weed stores.
[30:08.630 --> 30:13.630]  Like that's a reality in 2016 that we have a major popular well-funded candidate
[30:15.270 --> 30:16.830]  for the highest office in the land.
[30:16.830 --> 30:20.070]  Who's talking about sending the army to shut down weed stores in Colorado.
[30:20.430 --> 30:21.710]  You guys work in the retail.
[30:22.110 --> 30:24.750]  What are you going to do one day when a tank rolls up into the fucking parking
[30:24.750 --> 30:25.590]  lot?
[30:26.310 --> 30:27.130]  Well,
[30:28.710 --> 30:32.430]  cause I work in the spring. So like, I don't know if that, well, I guess if it,
[30:32.470 --> 30:34.070]  if it goes away for good. Yeah.
[30:34.350 --> 30:36.630]  They're first in the spring. They're already in the spring.
[30:36.670 --> 30:41.030]  When the tank shows up, I'm going to stop worrying about the consumption on site.
[30:41.030 --> 30:43.430]  We'll take a dab real quick and bounce with my new rig.
[30:43.430 --> 30:46.470]  As much hash as I can carry. Speaking of new rig,
[30:46.670 --> 30:49.630]  big shout out to my friend, Colorado Springs.
[30:50.510 --> 30:53.990]  Yeah. I think I would just have to look over and be like my bad hunt and start
[30:54.430 --> 30:57.790]  exactly like set up a station real quick and be like, so who wants a glob?
[30:57.790 --> 30:58.630]  Real fast.
[30:59.190 --> 31:01.390]  I'm going to go outside and yell at the tank.
[31:06.310 --> 31:07.350]  Who the fuck is your boss?
[31:07.950 --> 31:10.270]  Well, no, I don't think that. I don't think they think that.
[31:10.270 --> 31:12.110]  I don't think they'd be surprised that I was like,
[31:12.110 --> 31:14.870]  who wants to help me carry all this stuff that we can carry out this window.
[31:14.910 --> 31:17.150]  That's on the other side of the building from the tank.
[31:18.550 --> 31:23.030]  Oh my God. How much can we shove in our pockets and get out of here?
[31:23.510 --> 31:25.750]  I'm poofing. I keep Cola. Is it weird?
[31:30.750 --> 31:33.310]  I can't. The question is, did I take the lid off or not?
[31:37.270 --> 31:40.510]  Tiny bubbles. This is one of the weirdest podcasts I've ever done.
[31:40.590 --> 31:44.150]  It's cause it started. Tweet us your thoughts. Yeah. It started around.
[31:44.310 --> 31:48.950]  It started at when we start dabbing at 1140 to record. This is bound to happen.
[31:48.950 --> 31:53.270]  It's been a long day. It has. It's been a great day though. Yeah. Big, big,
[31:53.430 --> 31:55.790]  big, huge respect to everybody that I had fun with today.
[31:55.790 --> 32:00.150]  You know who I always shout out to a fucking Cooper bro.
[32:00.190 --> 32:04.230]  Coops. Uh, you're doing the 22 pushups every day.
[32:04.710 --> 32:07.710]  When you started off really like a wiggle worm by like day three, bro,
[32:07.710 --> 32:09.950]  you're doing pushups, man. I'm proud of you. Uh,
[32:09.990 --> 32:13.110]  I think it's inspiring that you actually, uh,
[32:13.150 --> 32:16.230]  posted the videos from the beginning when you knew you weren't killing it.
[32:16.230 --> 32:19.070]  Cause I'm sure by day 22, you're going to look like a fucking Marine dude.
[32:19.070 --> 32:21.070]  So shout out. That is awesome. Much respect.
[32:21.630 --> 32:24.390]  A lot of people wouldn't even have the heart or the balls to try it.
[32:24.950 --> 32:28.070]  Let alone post the videos that you posted. So that's fucking cool. Yeah.
[32:28.070 --> 32:32.070]  Lindsay's over here putting her hand up. I haven't done it. I'll do it. I, I,
[32:32.270 --> 32:35.830]  I don't even know if I can throw down 22 to tell you the truth, but I'll try it.
[32:35.870 --> 32:39.110]  I can't 22 girl ones. I got you in 22 girl ones. That's why I,
[32:39.190 --> 32:40.510]  I told you that story, right?
[32:41.070 --> 32:44.790]  That hunt had posted it and he had called out all of the nugs family and I'd
[32:44.790 --> 32:47.390]  liked it by accident before I like read through the whole comment.
[32:47.390 --> 32:50.150]  And I was like, now I'm like obligated, but like,
[32:50.150 --> 32:51.470]  I don't know how to do pushups.
[32:51.550 --> 32:54.030]  That's who I was going to give a shout out to you next was our boy hunt.
[32:54.110 --> 32:57.550]  You like something without reading the whole post and now you have to like learn
[32:57.550 --> 32:58.870]  a new physical activity.
[32:59.990 --> 33:03.310]  And I couldn't like, unlike it. Cause I feel like that was rude too. So, I mean,
[33:03.310 --> 33:06.230]  not like he would have noticed, right. But I like, I don't know. I just was like,
[33:06.230 --> 33:07.830]  all right, I'm just going to leave this here. Like pretty good.
[33:08.670 --> 33:10.030]  But big shout outs to hunt.
[33:10.030 --> 33:13.990]  What we're talking about is the 22 pushups for veterans because, uh,
[33:14.310 --> 33:16.430]  every so frequently, I don't remember the stats. I don't have the post.
[33:16.710 --> 33:21.110]  Every day, every day. Thank you, Mike. Every day, 22 veterans commit suicide.
[33:21.310 --> 33:26.230]  So some of my friends are posting to Facebook videos of themselves doing 22
[33:26.230 --> 33:30.110]  pushups every day for 22 days straight to raise awareness for veterans, uh,
[33:30.110 --> 33:32.310]  to show support for veterans, to help out,
[33:32.310 --> 33:35.670]  to encourage people to reach out to veterans. So big shout out to John hunt,
[33:36.030 --> 33:37.830]  uh, not just for doing this pushup challenge,
[33:38.070 --> 33:41.590]  but cause he's a bad motherfucker every single day in every single way. Uh,
[33:41.590 --> 33:44.310]  that dude's an inspiration. He inspired coop to do pushups.
[33:44.310 --> 33:46.910]  He inspired me to do some pushups. He's going to inspire Lindsay to do them.
[33:46.910 --> 33:50.870]  Before too long. Uh, he, he pushes everybody to the next level, uh,
[33:50.910 --> 33:54.710]  in all aspects. That's an inside joke aspects. Uh,
[33:54.710 --> 33:57.230]  if you hang out with hunt one time, you'll see why he's the word aspects,
[33:57.510 --> 33:59.990]  but a shout out to hunt your bad motherfucker. So, uh, yeah,
[33:59.990 --> 34:03.750]  some people that deserve to shout out everybody just nods.
[34:03.870 --> 34:06.830]  For sure. Yeah. They can't hear our nods. I always think about it.
[34:08.070 --> 34:12.670]  They're happening. Uh, and if I'm going to talk about veterans, I didn't plan.
[34:12.670 --> 34:14.710]  This wasn't part of the show. I was going to give a shout out to Coupon hunt.
[34:14.990 --> 34:16.510]  Uh, Steve Dufino, my friend, uh,
[34:16.510 --> 34:19.230]  you deserve a huge shout out for what you do with the veteran farmers Alliance.
[34:19.230 --> 34:22.550]  If you guys are a veteran or have a friend or relative, that's a veteran,
[34:22.550 --> 34:24.830]  make sure you get them in touch with the veteran farmers Alliance.
[34:24.830 --> 34:28.630]  I had a listener that sent me a message saying they wanted to get in touch with
[34:28.630 --> 34:32.750]  Steve and I gave Steve your contact info. It was easier for me to do it that way.
[34:32.750 --> 34:35.790]  But Steve said he's attempted to contact you. So I hope that has gone through.
[34:36.150 --> 34:38.430]  So yeah, that was random. That was a sidebar. Uh,
[34:38.430 --> 34:41.950]  but shout out to all the people raising awareness for the veterans.
[34:42.990 --> 34:43.830]  No, that's awesome.
[34:45.030 --> 34:48.990]  We need to be doing a lot more and anything to raise awareness. I'm for, yes.
[34:49.070 --> 34:54.030]  For anything that's worth raising awareness for. Absolutely. Yeah. Um,
[34:54.030 --> 34:55.910]  all right. We've been going for a little while. Uh,
[34:55.950 --> 34:58.670]  anybody got any final words to say while you've got a microphone in front of you
[34:58.670 --> 35:01.310]  and a whole bunch of people are going to hear your opinions and thoughts.
[35:02.310 --> 35:05.430]  Uh, I laid down pretty much what I had to lay down. Yeah, you did go out,
[35:05.430 --> 35:07.790]  get your shit registered to vote and vote when the time comes,
[35:07.790 --> 35:09.510]  because if we don't, we're going to lose fucking weed.
[35:09.710 --> 35:14.270]  Do it seriously. We don't want to start taking steps back now. Um,
[35:14.310 --> 35:18.590]  and that's what could easily happen in, uh,
[35:18.630 --> 35:20.110]  the next couple of election cycles.
[35:20.590 --> 35:24.230]  Mike, I can really walk this backwards. How can people find you on Twitter?
[35:24.310 --> 35:29.310]  You can find me at, uh, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or at Pueblo for sensible
[35:29.870 --> 35:31.630]  cannabis laws on Facebook. There you go.
[35:31.630 --> 35:35.310]  Make sure you support Mike's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws, Facebook page.
[35:35.870 --> 35:36.950]  Mike knows a lot about cannabis.
[35:36.950 --> 35:41.390]  He knows a lot about local cannabis laws and rules. Thanks dude.
[35:42.270 --> 35:43.270]  Thank you, buddy.
[35:45.590 --> 35:49.950]  Did we just mental fist bump? I think that just happened. Awesome.
[35:50.230 --> 35:53.470]  Miss Lindsay, the beautiful. How can people find you on the Twitter? Oh man,

[36:10.670 --> 36:13.150]  It's traveling stoner without the G. Uh,
[36:13.190 --> 36:16.510]  are you the one responsible for the Snapchat for greener, healthy wellness?
[36:16.630 --> 36:18.470]  And the mass roots and the mass roots.
[36:18.510 --> 36:21.470]  So give those pages a shout out for us so that we can get more follows. Um,

[36:40.950 --> 36:44.110]  adventures, better ventures. What the fuck is the word there? Ventures. Sure.
[36:44.150 --> 36:46.910]  Whatever they've moved on. And so now Lindsay is, uh,
[36:47.270 --> 36:52.550]  picking up the slack and killing it over there. Killing it. Thank you. Um,
[36:52.670 --> 36:55.430]  should we even talk about the flowers that were on the shelf that were grown by
[36:55.470 --> 36:59.230]  me that are probably sold out by the time this episode drops? Yeah. They,
[36:59.310 --> 37:00.710]  they will definitely be gone,
[37:00.710 --> 37:03.150]  but there'll be more of those strains on the shelves later.
[37:03.430 --> 37:05.550]  There'll be more stuff coming. There's there, uh,
[37:05.590 --> 37:08.310]  we are going to keep good stuff coming on the shelves. Uh,
[37:08.310 --> 37:11.350]  I've gotten it under control now. It's going to be awesome. Good.
[37:11.590 --> 37:14.910]  We've got a lot of good things coming. I think everything is going great.
[37:15.390 --> 37:17.750]  Shout out to Turpex for the new packaging. That looks dope.
[37:17.910 --> 37:22.270]  Shout out to Turpex in general. Just, yeah.
[37:22.910 --> 37:25.670]  I'm a huge fan too. Hey Jordan,
[37:25.670 --> 37:29.550]  when are we going to put the band back together? Yeah.
[37:29.550 --> 37:31.470]  Also a fan of the music bars. Well done.
[37:31.710 --> 37:35.990]  So should we get them back on the show again? Yes. A million times. Yes.
[37:36.030 --> 37:37.830]  All right. You Turpey boys. Uh, they don't,
[37:37.830 --> 37:41.150]  I don't think they listen to the show. Jordan, Dan, Shane,
[37:41.390 --> 37:45.470]  we got to get you on the show boys. All right. So we've been going for a long time.
[37:45.470 --> 37:48.590]  I feel like, uh, I've got ADD. So the listeners probably have got ADD by now.
[37:48.590 --> 37:51.870]  I want to thank my friends for joining me. Uh, it's fucking Thursday. Well,
[37:51.910 --> 37:54.790]  now it's Friday morning, Thursday night at 1am.
[37:54.790 --> 37:58.030]  And we're recording a podcast taking dabs. So, uh, once again,
[37:58.030 --> 38:00.710]  I do have to give huge love to my friends at elevate glass for this new
[38:00.710 --> 38:04.030]  recycler rig that they gave me a shout out to all the lovely ladies and the one
[38:04.030 --> 38:07.350]  gentleman down there. And also shout out to the adorable little dogs. Uh,
[38:07.390 --> 38:11.990]  the one dog ate a packet of Taco Bell hot sauce and it smelled like an atomic
[38:11.990 --> 38:13.950]  bomb went off in that store for a couple of seconds,
[38:13.950 --> 38:16.590]  but it was really funny because the dog is so cute that it was worth it.
[38:17.630 --> 38:19.110]  The look on your face. I know.
[38:19.150 --> 38:21.390]  Cause I know what dogs you're talking about cause I've been in there before.
[38:21.390 --> 38:24.350]  So like I can only imagine they're so cute though.
[38:24.350 --> 38:27.190]  Little inky dropped a bomb. So shout out to all my,
[38:27.230 --> 38:30.390]  my lovely friends over at elevate glass. Uh, they treat me like royalty there.
[38:30.630 --> 38:34.230]  If you need glass and you're in the Colorado Springs area, go check them out.
[38:34.350 --> 38:36.550]  It's a dope ass place. Tell him I sent you, please do it.
[38:36.550 --> 38:39.190]  Make sure you let them know that Ross to Jeff sent you mentioned that shit.
[38:40.230 --> 38:44.070]  All right. We're going to get out of here. Um, yeah. All right.
[38:44.070 --> 38:46.750]  All you guys got to do now is go to iTunes, uh,
[38:46.790 --> 38:49.390]  search for the review section, search for the girl from your heart podcast.
[38:49.630 --> 38:52.230]  Give me a rating. Uh, I'm not going to tell you to give me five stars.
[38:52.270 --> 38:53.630]  You do what you think I deserve.
[38:53.670 --> 38:56.590]  I think asking for five stars might've been like a cheap thing to do.
[38:56.790 --> 38:58.750]  That's not cool. You may not think I deserve five.
[38:59.030 --> 39:01.310]  Give me what you really feel that I deserve. That sounds fair.
[39:01.550 --> 39:03.670]  Type in a comment. Let me know what you think about the podcast.
[39:03.990 --> 39:07.070]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.

[39:34.990 --> 39:36.630]  That was, you look like you were trying to hide it.
[39:36.750 --> 39:38.310]  Cause I thought you were looking at me funny.
[39:38.390 --> 39:41.950]  I can see that at the corner of my eye. Come on. I'm a Ninja over here. All right.
[39:42.150 --> 39:44.430]  We're going to take some more dabs you guys. And until next time,
[39:44.430 --> 39:46.950]  take a fat dad and give your mama a hug for me.

[40:22.040 --> 40:26.200]  one by one and give all the time. Some free stuff for all that he has done.
[40:26.240 --> 40:27.520]  Go to your blessings.
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.040]  Call them to buy it to undo until I do want to do you.
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.040]  I call my blessing because we judge her by my side.
[40:35.040 --> 40:39.160]  There is no stressing, no if, but maybe there is no guessing.
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.280]  We report. We saw one. We keep on progressing.
[40:42.600 --> 40:43.920]  No regressing.
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.880]  When you think you got it, but somebody got it.
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.520]  I'm feeling sad and oh well somebody feeling sad to give on to your sister.
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.320]  Run your brother.
[40:53.520 --> 40:55.640]  You never read the bottom of the ladder.
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.080]  That's why we give thanks for this universal university.
[40:59.280 --> 41:02.080]  We give thanks for my strength and sanity.
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.840]  We give thanks for my friends.
[41:04.040 --> 41:08.040]  Also my family and all my jamming with the fraternity.
[41:08.240 --> 41:09.240]  I feel blessed.
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.640]  Blessings I bring to you, my children.
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.360]  Yeah, blessings I bring to you.
[41:19.560 --> 41:25.680]  Yeah, blessings I bring to you, my sweet children.
[41:25.880 --> 41:30.560]  Yeah, blessings I bring to you.
[41:30.760 --> 41:31.760]  To you.
[41:31.960 --> 41:32.960]  I'm feeling blessed.
[41:33.160 --> 41:35.120]  I'm putting in the past all of my stress.
[41:35.120 --> 41:35.920]  I'm not hurting.
[41:35.920 --> 41:38.200]  That's for certain because I'm working with the best.
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.120]  God put me to a test and said he'd lend a hand and told me he would mow me to an
[41:43.320 --> 41:47.160]  independent man now I'm looking at me and I'm a little more better.
[41:47.360 --> 41:48.920]  My mom ain't losing the dream.
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.160]  I just won't let her.
[41:50.360 --> 41:53.240]  I want to spread a message of positivity
[41:53.440 --> 41:56.160]  and an opportunity is what you're giving me.
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.240]  So I'm a spread my love from the scene out to the babies.
[41:59.440 --> 42:02.200]  Respect for my brethren and smiles for the ladies.
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.000]  You can look, but you can't touch because I might hurt looking clean.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.480]  And then I'm gonna wear jeans and a white shirt.
[42:08.680 --> 42:11.360]  And yes, I might flirt, but that's my downfall.
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.040]  So many lovely ladies and I think I love them all.
[42:14.240 --> 42:15.440]  I got a lot to give.
[42:15.640 --> 42:16.920]  That's all I got to live.
[42:17.120 --> 42:19.840]  And like the homie, Pato told me, stay positive.
[42:20.040 --> 42:23.920]  Collaboration with my brethren from the UK and Mystic Roots,
[42:24.120 --> 42:27.440]  Banxico, California, the only thing that's the same.
[42:27.640 --> 42:29.040]  I'm understandably busy.

[43:08.440 --> 43:10.160]  What is what?
[43:10.360 --> 43:11.240]  That's the P.
[43:11.440 --> 43:12.640]  Me no.
[43:12.840 --> 43:14.160]  What's this?
[43:14.360 --> 43:14.960]  What is what?
[43:15.160 --> 43:18.160]  I mean, I'm a.
[43:18.360 --> 43:20.360]  I'm a lightning.
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.360]  Some come down and get out and hurt is like a melting pot.
[43:23.560 --> 43:23.840]  Grab it.
[43:23.840 --> 43:25.360]  A cream in a cream in a crap on a bubbling
[43:25.560 --> 43:28.600]  to play football in a ball to play cricket.
[43:28.640 --> 43:31.880]  You need to become a.
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.800]  Not unless you set the normals of an area
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.360]  make the make to make they don't come and make nuisance to that.
[43:39.480 --> 43:40.840]  So we need a cup feed cup.
