[00:17.020 --> 00:19.540]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.540 --> 00:21.620]  It's time for episode number 196
[00:21.620 --> 00:23.460]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.460 --> 00:27.100]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.100 --> 00:28.260]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.260 --> 00:29.660]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.660 --> 00:32.100]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.100 --> 00:34.180]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:34.180 --> 00:37.020]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.020 --> 00:40.100]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.100 --> 00:42.220]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:42.220 --> 00:44.180]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.180 --> 00:46.460]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:46.460 --> 00:48.140]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:48.140 --> 00:50.940]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:50.940 --> 00:55.140]  Big shout to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.220 --> 00:57.540]  Ah, that was much better.
[00:57.540 --> 00:58.380]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:58.380 --> 01:00.460]  this is actually take two of the podcast.
[01:00.460 --> 01:01.980]  I recorded for a few minutes and realized
[01:01.980 --> 01:04.660]  I was not feeling it, I was not in the zone.
[01:04.660 --> 01:07.420]  I took a little break, took a couple of fat dabs,
[01:07.420 --> 01:10.780]  I dabbed some cactus cooler, I took some dabs of a rise,
[01:10.780 --> 01:13.740]  and guess what, I have risen and I have cooled the fuck out.
[01:13.740 --> 01:16.300]  Feeling much better, I'm in the podcast zone now.
[01:17.140 --> 01:18.460]  Thank you for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18.460 --> 01:20.260]  I hope you're dabbed out just like I am.
[01:20.260 --> 01:22.500]  I hope you're smoking a blunt, smoking a joint.
[01:22.500 --> 01:25.100]  Maybe you're smoking a twax joint.
[01:25.100 --> 01:26.540]  Maybe you're smoking some rosin.
[01:26.540 --> 01:27.940]  Whatever you're doing, I hope you're feeling good,
[01:27.940 --> 01:29.700]  I hope you're nice and red-eyed.
[01:29.700 --> 01:30.540]  I'm feeling much better.
[01:30.540 --> 01:31.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna give a shout out
[01:31.740 --> 01:33.700]  to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[01:33.700 --> 01:37.340]  Elevate Glass at 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[01:37.340 --> 01:40.260]  Today I scored two brand new Elevate bangers.
[01:40.260 --> 01:42.380]  I just buy these bangers from Elevate.
[01:42.380 --> 01:45.100]  I mess them up real bad, make them real chazzed up.
[01:45.460 --> 01:46.540]  They're burnt out, they're fried.
[01:46.540 --> 01:48.460]  I just buy the cheap ones, throw them away and replace them.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.500]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate
[01:49.500 --> 01:51.660]  for keeping me laced up with fresh glass.
[01:51.660 --> 01:54.900]  Speaking of fresh glass, I got this brand new carb cap.
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.580]  It is shiny black glass.
[01:56.580 --> 01:57.900]  I like the black glass look.
[01:57.900 --> 01:59.460]  It's pretty fresh, pretty sleek.
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.780]  I've got a directional carb cap.
[02:00.780 --> 02:02.660]  It is in the shape of kind of like a chess piece.
[02:02.660 --> 02:05.740]  It kind of looks like maybe a pawn on a chess board.
[02:05.740 --> 02:07.020]  Big shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[02:07.020 --> 02:07.900]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:07.900 --> 02:09.660]  I appreciate you guys, I love you.
[02:09.660 --> 02:10.500]  Make sure you check them out.
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.460]  517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[02:12.460 --> 02:14.260]  If you need new smoking accessories
[02:14.300 --> 02:16.380]  or if you just want to go spoil your eyes
[02:16.380 --> 02:17.780]  with some great glass and some young,
[02:17.780 --> 02:20.500]  beautiful Elevate dolls, check out Elevate Glass.
[02:20.500 --> 02:21.780]  Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[02:21.780 --> 02:22.740]  Let them know you're listening
[02:22.740 --> 02:24.580]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:25.940 --> 02:27.460]  Since I'm doing shout outs, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:27.460 --> 02:28.940]  let me give a huge shout out to everybody
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.700]  who has supported me on Patreon.
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.620]  I completely and truly appreciate
[02:32.620 --> 02:34.620]  all of the support I get on Patreon.
[02:35.500 --> 02:36.460]  I can't thank you guys enough.
[02:36.460 --> 02:38.860]  Also, if you're interested in contributing to Patreon,
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.900]  all you have to do is go to patreon.com
[02:40.900 --> 02:42.660]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:42.660 --> 02:44.060]  All the information that you need is there.
[02:44.860 --> 02:46.500]  Let me tell you quickly what Patreon is.
[02:46.500 --> 02:48.700]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[02:48.700 --> 02:51.020]  to contribute to the podcast financially.
[02:51.020 --> 02:53.060]  That's right, if you want to donate a couple of bucks,
[02:53.060 --> 02:54.140]  if you feel like this podcast
[02:54.140 --> 02:55.860]  is worth a dollar or two of your time,
[02:55.860 --> 02:57.460]  you can go to Patreon and you can sign up
[02:57.460 --> 02:58.980]  to contribute to Patreon.
[02:58.980 --> 03:01.580]  You can throw down as much money as you feel necessary.
[03:01.580 --> 03:03.700]  I'm not begging, but if you want to support me,
[03:03.700 --> 03:04.740]  I truly appreciate it.
[03:04.740 --> 03:06.540]  Some people thought it was worth a few dollars.
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.700]  They threw down some sizable contributions.
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.540]  I appreciate each and every one of you.
[03:10.540 --> 03:12.220]  You guys that can't contribute to Patreon,
[03:12.220 --> 03:14.020]  I still love each and every one of you also.
[03:14.860 --> 03:15.700]  Keep listening to the podcast.
[03:15.700 --> 03:17.140]  I'm not doing this to get rich.
[03:17.140 --> 03:18.660]  I'm doing it because I love growing cannabis
[03:18.660 --> 03:20.980]  and I want you to be able to grow better cannabis
[03:20.980 --> 03:21.940]  with my guidance.
[03:21.940 --> 03:24.140]  So don't feel bad if you can't contribute to Patreon,
[03:24.140 --> 03:25.740]  but those folks that did, thank you.
[03:25.740 --> 03:28.060]  I owe you a big thank you, big high five.
[03:28.060 --> 03:28.900]  I appreciate it.
[03:29.940 --> 03:30.940]  All right, what I want to get into
[03:30.940 --> 03:32.060]  to start the podcast, you guys,
[03:32.060 --> 03:34.260]  is I want to read some iTunes comments.
[03:34.260 --> 03:36.380]  I've been getting quite a few iTunes comments.
[03:36.380 --> 03:40.420]  The last one I read was from our friend KCCB68.
[03:40.420 --> 03:41.700]  Let me see where we are now.
[03:41.700 --> 03:43.620]  This comment, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.980]  everybody has given me a five star review so far.
[03:46.980 --> 03:48.620]  Let me turn on a little music here.
[03:48.620 --> 03:49.660]  Turn this down.
[03:49.660 --> 03:51.140]  Get that out of my headphones so much.
[03:51.140 --> 03:53.780]  All right, if you want to leave me a comment on iTunes,
[03:53.780 --> 03:54.620]  here's what you got to do.
[03:54.620 --> 03:55.460]  You need to go to iTunes.
[03:55.460 --> 03:56.780]  Go to the iTunes store.
[03:56.780 --> 04:00.100]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:00.100 --> 04:02.380]  You guys, those dabs I took are certainly working.
[04:02.380 --> 04:04.540]  Shout out to my friend, the Barefoot Grower
[04:04.540 --> 04:06.340]  and Barefoot Extracts.
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.860]  Great job on the extraction there.
[04:08.860 --> 04:10.460]  Tastes delicious and I'm dabbed out.
[04:10.460 --> 04:11.940]  So all you have to do, go to iTunes.
[04:11.940 --> 04:12.940]  Go to the iTunes store.
[04:13.260 --> 04:14.900]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[04:14.900 --> 04:16.620]  It'll show you the little icon, the logo.
[04:16.620 --> 04:17.540]  It's red, gold, and green.
[04:17.540 --> 04:18.380]  It's Rastafari.
[04:18.380 --> 04:19.300]  It's got my face on it.
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.140]  It says Grow From Your Heart.
[04:20.140 --> 04:21.140]  Click on there.
[04:21.140 --> 04:22.860]  Go to where it says Ratings and Reviews.
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.500]  It's right in the middle.
[04:24.500 --> 04:26.920]  Then all you got to do is click Rate.
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.980]  You can give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[04:28.980 --> 04:31.220]  So far, everybody has given me a five star review.
[04:31.220 --> 04:33.980]  Then you can write a review if you feel like doing so
[04:33.980 --> 04:37.400]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[04:37.400 --> 04:40.080]  Now let's get to the reviews that people have left for me.
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.000]  This one comes from a person who calls themselves
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.840]  303 Goat Weed.
[04:44.840 --> 04:46.280]  Of course, they gave me a five star review
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.200]  and it says, this is simply the best cannabis podcast.
[04:49.200 --> 04:50.940]  Thank you for all the great content.
[04:50.940 --> 04:53.720]  I owe the success of my grow to this show.
[04:53.720 --> 04:55.920]  Can't wait to meet all you guys someday
[04:55.920 --> 04:57.220]  and share some dabs.
[04:57.220 --> 04:58.880]  Cheers and keep it ivory.
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.520]  The best cannabis podcast.
[05:01.520 --> 05:02.360]  I appreciate that.
[05:02.360 --> 05:03.720]  I'm not in any competition.
[05:03.720 --> 05:04.600]  I'm not trying to compete,
[05:04.600 --> 05:07.400]  but I do appreciate hearing that I am your favorite
[05:07.400 --> 05:08.820]  and that I have been the most helpful for you.
[05:08.820 --> 05:10.260]  That means a lot to me.
[05:10.260 --> 05:12.060]  You're very welcome for all the great content.
[05:12.060 --> 05:13.860]  Thank you for the comment.
[05:13.860 --> 05:15.380]  Thanks for listening.
[05:15.380 --> 05:17.500]  You don't owe the success of your grow to this show.
[05:17.500 --> 05:19.980]  You may owe some of the guidance to this show.
[05:19.980 --> 05:22.180]  You're very welcome, but you did the work.
[05:22.180 --> 05:24.340]  You listened, you learned, you took notes.
[05:24.340 --> 05:26.060]  You went in there and actually did the shit.
[05:26.060 --> 05:27.540]  All I did was shout out instructions.
[05:27.540 --> 05:29.780]  You followed instructions, so good job to you.
[05:29.780 --> 05:31.900]  The success was you and your grow
[05:31.900 --> 05:33.540]  and you paying attention and loving those plants.
[05:33.540 --> 05:35.520]  I appreciate that you gave me some credit for that,
[05:35.520 --> 05:37.260]  but you did it.
[05:37.260 --> 05:39.540]  Can't wait to meet all you guys someday, you said.
[05:39.540 --> 05:43.020]  Dude, I am going to the Dude Grows Cup on 4-15.
[05:43.020 --> 05:43.900]  That's April 15th.
[05:43.900 --> 05:45.300]  It's a Saturday.
[05:45.300 --> 05:46.460]  It's kind of a private party.
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.980]  You need to listen to the Dude Grows Show podcast
[05:48.980 --> 05:51.420]  for more information and come join me
[05:51.420 --> 05:54.020]  and some of my friends at the Dude Grows Cup
[05:54.020 --> 05:55.680]  in Denver on April 15th.
[05:56.980 --> 05:58.380]  Tentatively planned to be there.
[05:58.380 --> 06:00.920]  I can't promise that my friends will be there,
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.740]  but planned to be there, scheduled to appear
[06:03.740 --> 06:07.000]  are myself, Dabin Granny, the Traveling Stoner,
[06:07.740 --> 06:10.400]  Bobo Blaster Co, and if all goes well,
[06:10.400 --> 06:12.840]  White Mike will be there, Nemo Punk 15,
[06:12.840 --> 06:14.920]  White Mike, Mike from the podcast.
[06:14.920 --> 06:16.360]  He doesn't get out much.
[06:16.360 --> 06:18.320]  We're gonna try to get him up there to the event.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.880]  So that will be a chance for you to come dab
[06:20.880 --> 06:22.360]  and meet all of us and get iry.
[06:22.360 --> 06:23.760]  I'm gonna sneeze, excuse me.
[06:25.620 --> 06:26.960]  It didn't happen because I spoke of it,
[06:26.960 --> 06:29.760]  so when I sneeze here randomly, I apologize.
[06:29.760 --> 06:30.920]  Ooh, sorry.
[06:30.920 --> 06:32.720]  Not a very professional podcast move right there,
[06:32.720 --> 06:34.640]  but we're not even gonna edit that.
[06:34.640 --> 06:35.620]  Mike will be there.
[06:35.620 --> 06:36.640]  You can come dab with us.
[06:37.280 --> 06:38.480]  If you were in Colorado, there's a good chance
[06:38.480 --> 06:39.600]  that you can get into this event.
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.120]  If you're not a Colorado person,
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.420]  if you're not gonna be in Colorado for April 15th,
[06:43.420 --> 06:44.560]  let's make some arrangements.
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.160]  Come to Colorado, we'll get down.
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.360]  But since your screen name was 303 Goat Weed,
[06:48.360 --> 06:50.120]  I kinda think you're a Denver person
[06:50.120 --> 06:52.040]  because that's the 303.
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.560]  Listen to the Dude Grows podcast and get to the event.
[06:56.560 --> 06:58.360]  By the time this comes out, this'll come out Monday,
[06:58.360 --> 07:00.120]  the event will be Saturday, you'll have time
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.520]  to figure it out, and I bet you'll be able
[07:01.520 --> 07:02.700]  to get on the list.
[07:02.700 --> 07:04.160]  I've said too much.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.700]  Thank you for the review, 303 Goat Weed.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.700]  Five stars.
[07:07.700 --> 07:09.400]  And he said, the title of the review was,
[07:09.400 --> 07:12.120]  this is your go-to for cannabis grow info.
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.680]  Great review, I appreciate it.
[07:13.680 --> 07:14.760]  Cheers, keep it iry.
[07:14.760 --> 07:17.580]  I hope to see you at an event in the very near future.
[07:17.580 --> 07:19.320]  You guys, I am very easy to find.
[07:19.320 --> 07:21.320]  If you were at an event in Colorado,
[07:21.320 --> 07:23.240]  I want you to find me, I want you to say hello.
[07:23.240 --> 07:25.200]  I am six foot five.
[07:25.200 --> 07:29.360]  I have got dreadlocks to my ass, almost to my knees.
[07:29.360 --> 07:31.960]  Some of them to one of them probably touches my knees.
[07:31.960 --> 07:34.760]  I usually keep my hair in a bun on the back of my head
[07:34.760 --> 07:36.240]  because I don't need my dreads tangled up
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.340]  in all your shit as we walk by each other.
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.520]  I usually wear a hat.
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.440]  I keep my hat backwards crooked to the left
[07:42.440 --> 07:44.020]  so I can reach with my left hand and adjust it.
[07:44.020 --> 07:46.400]  I've usually got sunglasses on because my eyes are red
[07:46.400 --> 07:48.800]  and I don't need you seeing my red ass eyes.
[07:48.800 --> 07:50.420]  I've got a ginger beard.
[07:50.420 --> 07:51.920]  My beard grows in red.
[07:51.920 --> 07:53.800]  I'm usually wearing an iRegenetics t-shirt
[07:53.800 --> 07:55.760]  or quite frequently nowadays, I'm wearing
[07:55.760 --> 07:57.880]  a Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirt.
[07:57.880 --> 07:59.760]  I'm easy to find, I want you to come shake my hand.
[07:59.760 --> 08:01.600]  Well, right now I got a little boo-boo on my hand.
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.720]  I hurt my finger so give me a little fist bump.
[08:04.720 --> 08:07.360]  We'll be friends still, but I want you to come say hello.
[08:07.360 --> 08:10.080]  I don't like hearing on social media when people say,
[08:10.080 --> 08:12.080]  hey dude, I saw you at this event
[08:12.080 --> 08:13.560]  but I didn't wanna come say hi
[08:13.560 --> 08:14.740]  because I didn't wanna bother you.
[08:14.740 --> 08:16.900]  You're not bothering me, that's what I'm there for.
[08:16.900 --> 08:18.480]  Come say hello, I'd love to meet each
[08:18.480 --> 08:19.640]  and every freaking one of you.
[08:19.640 --> 08:22.040]  You're all my friends, come say what's up.
[08:22.040 --> 08:23.260]  That was a long rant.
[08:23.260 --> 08:25.440]  Let's get on to the next comment.
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.200]  The next Facebook review, Facebook,
[08:28.200 --> 08:29.720]  I said fucking Facebook, iTunes review.
[08:29.720 --> 08:30.560]  You guys, I'm high as shit.
[08:30.560 --> 08:31.880]  I bet you could tell from those dabs.
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.840]  I am high as shit, it's working.
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.160]  This review says, it's from a person
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.160]  who calls himself me4437.
[08:39.160 --> 08:42.000]  The headline of the review is Wealth of Information
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.720]  and the review goes like this.
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.680]  This information is more comprehensive
[08:45.680 --> 08:47.100]  than any book on the subject.
[08:47.100 --> 08:50.000]  You can spend hundreds, a hundred hours
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.520]  filling your head with quality material.
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.000]  That's straight to the point and that's exactly,
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.440]  I thought about doing a book, you guys.
[08:58.440 --> 09:01.040]  I started writing the outline to write a book
[09:01.040 --> 09:02.440]  and then I realized that every week
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.680]  when I would write about cannabis, shit would change.
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.580]  Technology would change, rules would change,
[09:08.580 --> 09:11.640]  my ideas would change, what I learned would change,
[09:11.640 --> 09:14.000]  the stuff that was available to us would change.
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.480]  So I was like, man, I can't write a book
[09:15.480 --> 09:17.240]  because it evolves every week.
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.240]  Then I was talking to some friends
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.920]  at Spence and Maddie's house and I was like,
[09:20.920 --> 09:22.740]  I keep repeating this, I should record this
[09:22.740 --> 09:24.160]  and just tell people to go listen
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.000]  and then I was like, that's a podcast.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.640]  And I had another podcast with a friend
[09:27.640 --> 09:29.680]  where occasionally I would talk about pot
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.840]  and this show started off kind of as a spin-off
[09:32.840 --> 09:35.320]  from another show so that I could focus on weed.
[09:35.320 --> 09:38.160]  But instead of doing a book, I thought I'll do a podcast.
[09:38.160 --> 09:40.120]  And it's definitely true that it's more comprehensive
[09:40.120 --> 09:42.960]  than any book because I can update you every week
[09:42.960 --> 09:45.240]  and if something changes, I can tell you about that.
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.400]  A book, once it's published,
[09:46.400 --> 09:47.800]  I got to make a whole new edition.
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.680]  We got to go back and amend everything.
[09:49.680 --> 09:50.520]  That sucks.
[09:50.520 --> 09:51.960]  With a podcast, I can jump in at any time
[09:51.960 --> 09:54.960]  and say, hey, what I said last week, wrong update.
[09:54.960 --> 09:56.980]  So you're right, way more comprehensive than any book.
[09:57.020 --> 09:58.340]  I'm glad you noticed that.
[09:58.340 --> 10:01.460]  And 100 hours filling your head with quality material,
[10:01.460 --> 10:02.680]  that's absolutely correct.
[10:02.680 --> 10:05.780]  There are 196 episodes out now.
[10:05.780 --> 10:08.180]  Some of those are old flashback episodes.
[10:08.180 --> 10:09.760]  So there's probably, I would say,
[10:09.760 --> 10:11.780]  over 100 hours of quality material.
[10:11.780 --> 10:12.980]  So if you guys need something to listen to,
[10:12.980 --> 10:14.740]  go back and check out the archives.
[10:14.740 --> 10:15.580]  And since I mentioned it,
[10:15.580 --> 10:17.540]  I am putting out the old episodes in chunks.
[10:17.540 --> 10:20.200]  I try to put them out at least three episodes at a time.
[10:20.200 --> 10:21.380]  I try to make about a three,
[10:21.380 --> 10:23.220]  three and a half to four hour file.
[10:23.220 --> 10:25.540]  That's as large as my recording software will hold.
[10:25.540 --> 10:28.780]  I think that's as big as iTunes really wants to support.
[10:28.780 --> 10:30.340]  And for you guys downloading podcasts,
[10:30.340 --> 10:31.480]  that's probably a real bitch.
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.460]  Let me know what you think about that.
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.840]  The old episodes that I've been putting out,
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.620]  I want some reviews and some feedback.
[10:36.620 --> 10:39.260]  Please let me know what you think, how I'm doing with that.
[10:39.260 --> 10:40.100]  Do you love it?
[10:40.100 --> 10:40.920]  Do you hate it?
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.980]  Can I do it differently to make it better for you?
[10:42.980 --> 10:44.620]  A lot of people wanted those old episodes
[10:44.620 --> 10:45.860]  and that was the best way I could think of
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.300]  to put them out quickly.
[10:47.300 --> 10:48.700]  I am making YouTube videos.
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.260]  I keep promising you that.
[10:50.260 --> 10:51.300]  Some of them are posted.
[10:51.300 --> 10:53.780]  One through 25 should be available.
[10:53.780 --> 10:54.600]  They're coming, you guys.
[10:54.600 --> 10:55.440]  It's a lot of work.
[10:56.260 --> 10:57.640]  Please bear with me.
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.800]  Man, I got way off track there, but me, 4437.
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.720]  Thank you for the great review.
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.400]  Wealth of information, that's my goal.
[11:04.400 --> 11:06.280]  Of course, another five star review.
[11:06.280 --> 11:08.800]  iTunes asks you, was this review helpful?
[11:08.800 --> 11:11.960]  I'm going to click yes, because yes, that was helpful.
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.440]  And on 303 Goatweed, I'm clicking yes on your review also,
[11:15.440 --> 11:18.480]  because that review was very helpful.
[11:18.480 --> 11:19.840]  You guys, thank you for the five star reviews
[11:19.840 --> 11:22.560]  and thank you for the other reviews in general.
[11:22.560 --> 11:23.600]  Here's the next review.
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.360]  This one says, I look forward to this podcast every week.
[11:27.360 --> 11:29.300]  And of course, they gave me a five star review.
[11:29.300 --> 11:31.440]  It was left by a person who calls himself,
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.440]  sells BTL840.
[11:34.440 --> 11:36.600]  The review goes like this.
[11:36.600 --> 11:37.880]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast
[11:37.880 --> 11:39.280]  has a variety of interesting,
[11:39.280 --> 11:41.240]  yet practical topics on every episode
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.300]  and I enjoy the laid back manner in which it is presented.
[11:45.300 --> 11:47.360]  Rasta Jeff is very informative and thorough,
[11:47.360 --> 11:48.660]  but speaks in layman's terms
[11:48.660 --> 11:51.120]  so anyone can take advantage of his expertise
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.400]  as he is a plethora of gardening wisdom.
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.320]  Thanks Rasta Jeff.
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.300]  Wow, somebody just described me with the word wisdom,
[11:59.300 --> 12:02.040]  which is kind of fun to me, and expertise.
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.800]  I've never thought of myself as a wizard or an expert,
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.240]  but if you called me that, it's official.
[12:07.240 --> 12:08.360]  Didn't make that shit up myself.
[12:08.360 --> 12:10.160]  Hey, I truly appreciate, I know I'm joking around,
[12:10.160 --> 12:11.360]  but I truly appreciate that review.
[12:11.360 --> 12:13.440]  That's a huge compliment.
[12:13.440 --> 12:14.720]  Interesting yet practical.
[12:14.720 --> 12:16.400]  That's what I'm aiming for.
[12:16.400 --> 12:18.840]  Laid back, I couldn't do it any other way, you guys.
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.600]  I'm dabbed out, I'm chilling.
[12:20.600 --> 12:21.880]  I like to be a laid back guy.
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.120]  There's no reason to get uptight.
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.660]  We aren't doing rocket surgery here.
[12:24.660 --> 12:25.760]  We're growing cannabis.
[12:25.760 --> 12:28.720]  We're growing a plant to make us relax and feel better.
[12:28.720 --> 12:30.640]  It shouldn't be super stressful.
[12:30.640 --> 12:32.060]  And then we smoke a bunch of this shit
[12:32.060 --> 12:33.480]  so we're chilled out anyway.
[12:33.480 --> 12:35.760]  Informative and thorough, yes, that is my goal.
[12:35.760 --> 12:37.280]  Speaking in layman's terms,
[12:37.280 --> 12:39.480]  I feel like when I go to the doctor
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.400]  or when I go somewhere and somebody tries to talk to me
[12:41.400 --> 12:44.000]  and they use a whole bunch of glossary words
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.560]  to try to sound fancy, I think they're just schmucks.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.360]  I'm like, can't you just say,
[12:48.360 --> 12:50.880]  instead of using, I don't even have an example right now,
[12:50.880 --> 12:52.960]  but instead of using some big fancy word,
[12:53.800 --> 12:54.640]  you could have said blanket
[12:54.640 --> 12:56.840]  and they just made up some fancy word for blanket
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.400]  that was 17 syllables
[12:58.400 --> 13:00.420]  and it makes them feel good about themselves
[13:00.420 --> 13:02.560]  and they're trying to belittle you, I think.
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.000]  I think it's better when I just talk to you like you're me
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.840]  and we just get along like we're friends
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.800]  and I don't have to impress you
[13:08.800 --> 13:11.680]  with my plethora of glossary terms.
[13:11.680 --> 13:14.240]  That doesn't seem useful to me.
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.200]  But anyway, layman's terms, yes, that's what I try to do.
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.680]  Plethora of gardening wisdom.
[13:18.680 --> 13:19.600]  I like that, thank you.
[13:19.600 --> 13:20.480]  That means a lot to me.
[13:20.480 --> 13:22.920]  I've been doing this for a long time.
[13:23.760 --> 13:25.360]  Honestly, the way I learned a lot of what I was doing
[13:25.360 --> 13:27.160]  was just by fucking things up.
[13:27.160 --> 13:30.200]  I've got a lot of, I'm brave, I guess.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.560]  I'll try some stuff in the garden
[13:31.560 --> 13:32.620]  that most people wouldn't do
[13:32.620 --> 13:35.220]  and I'm not afraid to fuck some stuff up.
[13:35.220 --> 13:37.720]  A lot of people rely too heavily
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.100]  on the income of their garden
[13:39.100 --> 13:40.840]  or the medicine that they're going to receive
[13:40.840 --> 13:41.920]  from their garden
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.720]  and I was fortunate enough to have,
[13:45.720 --> 13:47.620]  I live in Colorado, first of all,
[13:47.620 --> 13:50.960]  and for the past 10 years at least,
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.880]  I've worked or been involved
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.000]  in the medical marijuana industry.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.640]  So I've always had plenty of cannabis available.
[13:57.640 --> 14:00.040]  There's always been plenty of medicine available to me
[14:00.040 --> 14:02.000]  and I've also had plenty of grow space.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.480]  I've had my own grows.
[14:03.480 --> 14:05.080]  I've had friends help me
[14:05.080 --> 14:07.880]  and let me help them grow in their spaces.
[14:07.880 --> 14:11.000]  I've had large facilities to grow in.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.560]  So I've had a lot of places to experiment
[14:13.560 --> 14:15.360]  and sometimes if I had 10 lights,
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.640]  I would dedicate two lights
[14:16.640 --> 14:19.120]  to trying to fuck something up and see what would happen.
[14:19.120 --> 14:20.560]  And that's how I learned a lot.
[14:21.200 --> 14:22.680]  It's just by going in and seeing what happens
[14:22.680 --> 14:24.760]  when I totally try to destroy these plants.
[14:24.760 --> 14:25.940]  What can they take?
[14:25.940 --> 14:26.780]  And then you learn stuff.
[14:26.780 --> 14:28.280]  You're like, ooh, when I bent this this way
[14:28.280 --> 14:29.120]  and broke it this way,
[14:29.120 --> 14:31.180]  it really grew like a champ like this.
[14:31.180 --> 14:33.940]  So I learned a lot by screwing things up
[14:33.940 --> 14:36.000]  and taking risks and being brave
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.920]  and I really think that that could help for most growers.
[14:37.920 --> 14:40.560]  Don't be so afraid to mess with your crop.
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.260]  Don't treat it like it's a little baby.
[14:42.260 --> 14:43.240]  It's a weed.
[14:43.240 --> 14:44.400]  I've joked about it before.
[14:44.400 --> 14:46.680]  This plant has been,
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.760]  it's grown on the side of a rocky mountain in Afghanistan.
[14:49.760 --> 14:51.240]  It got beat up by the wind.
[14:51.240 --> 14:52.480]  It got rained on.
[14:52.480 --> 14:54.280]  It got pissed on by a goat.
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.120]  It's had a snake hiding underneath it.
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.560]  It's been through all kinds of shit
[14:58.560 --> 14:59.640]  and these plants survive.
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.640]  They've evolved to survive through that.
[15:01.640 --> 15:03.340]  They're made to protect themselves.
[15:03.340 --> 15:05.080]  So you can beat the shit out of them in the grow
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.800]  and it might be good for them.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.280]  So my plethora of gardening knowledge and wisdom,
[15:09.280 --> 15:11.360]  a lot of that has come just by trial and error
[15:11.360 --> 15:13.940]  and not being afraid to screw things up.
[15:13.940 --> 15:17.560]  So BTL840, thanks for looking forward
[15:17.560 --> 15:19.000]  to the podcast every week.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.080]  I hope you hear this review
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.480]  and I hope you get kind of giddy.
[15:21.480 --> 15:22.560]  I appreciate it.
[15:22.560 --> 15:23.720]  Man, I am rambling tonight.
[15:23.720 --> 15:24.560]  I appreciate it.
[15:24.560 --> 15:26.100]  Those dabs really hooked me up.
[15:26.100 --> 15:27.000]  Thanks, Will.
[15:27.000 --> 15:27.960]  Good dabs, dude.
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.160]  All right, I'm gonna read another review.
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.380]  This one says, the Lemon G of podcasts.
[15:33.380 --> 15:36.120]  That's a huge compliment because in Colorado,
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.160]  the Lemon G is sought after.
[15:38.160 --> 15:39.880]  Those Lemon G Terps.
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.140]  You must be a Colorado person
[15:41.140 --> 15:42.400]  if you know about that Lemon G
[15:42.400 --> 15:44.000]  or maybe you're from Ohio.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.240]  That's where the Lemon G is from is what I hear.
[15:46.240 --> 15:48.000]  Anyway, this guy calls himself
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.920]  Darryl Strawberry Jr.
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.920]  And the review, of course, five stars.
[15:51.920 --> 15:53.400]  And the review goes like this.
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.160]  Great information and Jeff keeps it very interesting.
[15:56.160 --> 15:58.400]  Thank you for freely contributing to the community
[15:58.400 --> 16:00.600]  in an unbiased manner.
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.620]  You're very welcome.
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.640]  Yeah, that's what I'm here for
[16:03.640 --> 16:05.300]  is to contribute to the community,
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.800]  to help you grow better plants,
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.040]  to help you stay informed and educated about cannabis.
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.440]  Maybe you'll tell other people about cannabis.
[16:12.440 --> 16:13.520]  Maybe you'll share some,
[16:13.520 --> 16:15.520]  maybe you'll tell your grandma some stuff about cannabis
[16:15.520 --> 16:17.360]  or your mom some stuff about cannabis
[16:17.360 --> 16:18.920]  and maybe make them not so afraid.
[16:18.920 --> 16:21.980]  And when it comes time for people to vote about cannabis,
[16:21.980 --> 16:23.240]  they'll vote on our side.
[16:23.240 --> 16:25.080]  Maybe they'll tell some of their friends about it.
[16:25.080 --> 16:26.760]  But I'm just here to support cannabis, that's all.
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.600]  I want it better.
[16:27.600 --> 16:28.860]  So thank you for noticing.
[16:28.860 --> 16:30.040]  You're very welcome.
[16:30.040 --> 16:32.360]  Thanks for noticing that I try to keep it interesting.
[16:32.360 --> 16:33.520]  I do the best I can.
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.840]  And thanks for the five star review, Darryl Strawberry Jr.
[16:36.840 --> 16:38.920]  And then there's one more review
[16:38.920 --> 16:41.320]  left on the same day as Darryl Strawberry Jr.
[16:41.320 --> 16:44.480]  This one's left by somebody named Darryl Strawberry.
[16:44.480 --> 16:46.200]  Sounds like you might have two accounts.
[16:46.200 --> 16:47.840]  I appreciate the double reviews.
[16:47.840 --> 16:49.360]  I'm gonna read them both for you.
[16:49.360 --> 16:51.140]  The headline says, I and I approve.
[16:51.140 --> 16:53.080]  So you, Darryl Strawberry Jr.
[16:53.080 --> 16:55.400]  And you're part, you gotta have some Rasta belief in there
[16:55.400 --> 16:57.160]  if you say I and I.
[16:57.160 --> 16:58.280]  Let's read the comment.
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.420]  It goes, I appreciate the hard work you do on the podcast
[17:01.420 --> 17:03.180]  and in the community in general.
[17:03.180 --> 17:06.120]  If you are new to cannabis or an old crusty fart,
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.460]  this is the podcast for you.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.300]  That's right.
[17:10.160 --> 17:11.700]  If you're just learning about growing weed,
[17:11.700 --> 17:13.520]  smoking weed, consuming weed,
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.360]  if you wanna do research about cannabis,
[17:16.360 --> 17:18.080]  this podcast will help you out.
[17:18.080 --> 17:19.200]  If you're a crusty old fart,
[17:19.200 --> 17:21.360]  if you've been smoking forever,
[17:21.360 --> 17:24.160]  if you smoked weed through a gun in Vietnam,
[17:24.160 --> 17:26.040]  this podcast is still for you.
[17:26.040 --> 17:29.120]  If you were a dab kid trying to take three gram dabs
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.180]  off of an e-nail, this podcast is for you.
[17:32.180 --> 17:34.140]  If you're a medical smoker taking one puff
[17:34.140 --> 17:37.240]  off of a joint every six hours to alleviate some symptoms,
[17:37.240 --> 17:38.720]  this podcast is for you.
[17:38.720 --> 17:40.480]  I wanna put this podcast out for everybody
[17:40.480 --> 17:42.200]  who's interested in cannabis.
[17:42.640 --> 17:44.480]  Thanks for noticing that, Darryl Strawberry
[17:44.480 --> 17:46.040]  and Darryl Strawberry Jr.
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.320]  I appreciate all of the reviews.
[17:47.320 --> 17:49.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm rambling
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.640]  about these reviews.
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.080]  I completely appreciate it.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.540]  I would love it if you'd go to iTunes
[17:53.540 --> 17:55.560]  and leave me a rating and a review.
[17:55.560 --> 17:57.240]  So far, everyone's left me five stars.
[17:57.240 --> 17:59.360]  I got 51 five-star ratings, you guys.
[17:59.360 --> 18:00.200]  I'm proud of that.
[18:00.200 --> 18:01.120]  Thanks a lot.
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.800]  All right, you guys, I'm gonna press pause for a second.
[18:02.800 --> 18:05.200]  I'm gonna take a drink, and then when we get back,
[18:05.200 --> 18:07.960]  I'm going to talk about a worker protection safety class
[18:07.960 --> 18:09.920]  I took recently, and we'll talk a little bit
[18:09.920 --> 18:10.920]  about pesticides.
[18:10.920 --> 18:11.760]  I'll be right back.
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.320]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[18:14.320 --> 18:15.720]  I just made a marvelous discovery.
[18:15.720 --> 18:17.640]  This new carb cap that I picked up at Elevate today,
[18:17.640 --> 18:19.080]  it's a directional flow carb cap,
[18:19.080 --> 18:21.640]  which means when you cap the banger,
[18:21.640 --> 18:23.240]  I may have to explain the banger,
[18:23.240 --> 18:25.040]  the banger, instead of using a titanium nail,
[18:25.040 --> 18:25.880]  I'm using a banger.
[18:25.880 --> 18:28.640]  A banger looks kind of like a glass bowl,
[18:28.640 --> 18:30.360]  looks like a little bucket.
[18:30.360 --> 18:32.160]  It fits right where your bowl would go
[18:32.160 --> 18:34.240]  kind of on your smoking device,
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.640]  and then it's just a little glass bowl,
[18:35.640 --> 18:37.680]  and you heat that, and you put the dab in there,
[18:37.680 --> 18:39.160]  and then you cover it with a carb cap,
[18:39.160 --> 18:40.320]  and what that does is it kinda,
[18:40.320 --> 18:41.800]  you can let it get a little cooler,
[18:41.800 --> 18:42.640]  and then you cap it,
[18:42.640 --> 18:43.840]  and you don't have to take such a hot dab.
[18:43.840 --> 18:45.760]  It tastes better, it's easier on your lungs.
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.840]  When you cap it, it kinda stokes the heat.
[18:47.840 --> 18:49.020]  It traps the heat in there,
[18:49.020 --> 18:50.680]  so the lower heat cooks the dab a little better.
[18:50.680 --> 18:52.880]  You draw the oxygen over the trapped heat.
[18:52.880 --> 18:53.880]  It makes your dab a little better.
[18:53.880 --> 18:55.920]  It's cooler, it's softer, it's smoother, it tastes better.
[18:55.920 --> 18:57.640]  But I just discovered that this carb cap,
[18:57.640 --> 19:00.040]  it's directional flow, which means when I cap it,
[19:00.040 --> 19:02.760]  I can turn it, and that will stir my oil around
[19:02.760 --> 19:05.160]  on the nail a little bit, and the banger a little bit better
[19:05.160 --> 19:07.920]  so that I can get a more efficient burn on my oil.
[19:07.920 --> 19:09.560]  It'll kinda move it around instead of puddling up
[19:09.560 --> 19:10.760]  in one spot where it's cool.
[19:10.760 --> 19:13.520]  I can move it around to a hot spot, get a better dab.
[19:13.520 --> 19:16.720]  But also, it's got kind of an extended piece on the top
[19:16.720 --> 19:18.360]  of it with a hole in it, which of course,
[19:18.360 --> 19:19.720]  it's got a hole in it so that the air can flow,
[19:19.720 --> 19:22.920]  but I figured that if I put my finger on that hole,
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.960]  I can really control the amount of air flow I get up to me,
[19:26.960 --> 19:28.960]  and I just got a really killer dab with this thing.
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.440]  That was the best dab I've had with it so far.
[19:30.440 --> 19:31.880]  So shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[19:31.880 --> 19:34.040]  Once again, I know I'm kissing their asses a whole bunch
[19:34.040 --> 19:36.120]  on this episode, but they take really good care of me.
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.160]  I've got this really cool, this torch,
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.800]  this coil condenser torch.
[19:39.800 --> 19:41.120]  It's got the monkeys on it.
[19:41.120 --> 19:42.120]  It's got some bananas on it.
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.960]  It's got the bears.
[19:42.960 --> 19:43.780]  I really love that.
[19:43.780 --> 19:45.920]  I got my Hitman Hammerhead sidecar rig.
[19:45.920 --> 19:47.440]  I got my brand new banger.
[19:47.440 --> 19:48.800]  Got my brand new carb cap.
[19:48.800 --> 19:51.120]  Of course, I'm using my Tater Glass pencil dabber.
[19:51.120 --> 19:53.720]  We're all laced up from our friends at Elevate,
[19:53.720 --> 19:55.560]  and I couldn't be happier about it.
[19:55.560 --> 19:56.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, check them out.
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.680]  517 South Tahoe in Colorado Springs.
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.680]  Don't park on the main streets.
[19:59.680 --> 20:01.240]  Park on one of the side streets.
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.200]  Free parking.
[20:02.200 --> 20:03.320]  Take advantage of that shit.
[20:03.320 --> 20:04.920]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you,
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.440]  and of course, let them know that you listen
[20:06.440 --> 20:08.400]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[20:08.400 --> 20:12.080]  All right, you guys, recently I took a class in Denver
[20:12.080 --> 20:13.960]  sponsored by the Colorado State University
[20:13.960 --> 20:15.360]  and the Department of Agriculture,
[20:15.360 --> 20:19.320]  and of course, the Environmental Protection Agency.
[20:19.320 --> 20:21.080]  The class was a worker protection safety
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.320]  train the trainer class.
[20:22.320 --> 20:25.720]  I am now certified to train people
[20:25.720 --> 20:27.280]  in worker protection safety,
[20:27.280 --> 20:31.840]  which involves pesticides in agricultural applications,
[20:31.840 --> 20:34.320]  which means now I can train my employees,
[20:34.360 --> 20:36.440]  my coworkers, and other growers,
[20:36.440 --> 20:38.440]  and other workers in other facilities
[20:38.440 --> 20:42.080]  on how to safely handle pesticides under EPA guidelines
[20:42.080 --> 20:44.800]  and under Department of Agriculture guidelines,
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.080]  and of course, under the Marijuana Enforcement
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.160]  Division guidelines.
[20:49.160 --> 20:51.300]  So the class cost me $65 to take,
[20:51.300 --> 20:52.880]  but it was definitely worth every penny
[20:52.880 --> 20:56.000]  because I learned, it was invaluable.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.560]  I learned more information than I could have ever imagined.
[20:58.560 --> 20:59.900]  It was a four hour class.
[20:59.900 --> 21:01.960]  Honestly, it could have probably been condensed
[21:01.960 --> 21:04.400]  to about three hours, but the host,
[21:04.400 --> 21:06.820]  the lady that taught the class, her name was Thea,
[21:06.820 --> 21:07.860]  she was a great instructor.
[21:07.860 --> 21:09.960]  She kept my attention the entire time, you guys.
[21:09.960 --> 21:13.720]  Usually, you can tell by the podcast, I've got some ADD.
[21:13.720 --> 21:16.860]  I was not the ideal student in school.
[21:16.860 --> 21:18.140]  I was able to keep my mouth shut.
[21:18.140 --> 21:19.480]  I was able to sit still.
[21:19.480 --> 21:21.760]  I was able to pay attention for the entire four hour class.
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.000]  I didn't feel like I needed to get up
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.560]  and run out of the room.
[21:24.560 --> 21:25.760]  So good job to Thea.
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.440]  It was a great class.
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.900]  I learned a whole bunch.
[21:28.900 --> 21:31.360]  One thing that I really did learn, you guys,
[21:31.720 --> 21:34.600]  was that pesticide safety is completely overlooked.
[21:34.600 --> 21:37.680]  As growers, most of us are not paying attention
[21:37.680 --> 21:39.800]  to the safety of pesticides.
[21:39.800 --> 21:41.280]  We might read the bottle.
[21:41.280 --> 21:42.840]  We might follow those guidelines.
[21:42.840 --> 21:47.180]  We might spray, and from there, we overlook everything else.
[21:47.180 --> 21:49.640]  Let me talk a little bit about important stuff here
[21:49.640 --> 21:50.740]  when it comes to pesticides,
[21:50.740 --> 21:54.600]  because I learned things that home growers will benefit from,
[21:54.600 --> 21:57.160]  that commercial benefit growers will benefit from,
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.040]  that indoor and outdoor growers will benefit from.
[22:01.720 --> 22:02.560]  Excuse me, I'm coughing from the dab I took.
[22:02.560 --> 22:04.000]  It's finally creeping up on me.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.160]  I took a big old fat dab of some cactus cooler
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.760]  that's starting to set in.
[22:07.760 --> 22:09.000]  All right, I think I'm gonna live.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.440]  Let's talk about pesticide safety.
[22:11.440 --> 22:13.960]  The most important thing is to read the bottle.
[22:13.960 --> 22:16.040]  For every pesticide that you buy, on the front,
[22:16.040 --> 22:18.160]  it's got that little booklet that opens up.
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.800]  Peel that open, read it.
[22:19.800 --> 22:21.040]  All of the information that you need
[22:21.040 --> 22:23.280]  is going to be on that bottle.
[22:23.280 --> 22:24.840]  It's gonna tell you what kind of
[22:24.840 --> 22:26.900]  protective equipment you need.
[22:26.900 --> 22:29.140]  If you're spraying a product, a pesticide,
[22:29.140 --> 22:31.700]  you almost always need long sleeves,
[22:31.700 --> 22:34.920]  long pants, shoes and socks, and gloves.
[22:34.920 --> 22:36.640]  Most of the time, they're going to recommend
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.500]  some sort of eyewear.
[22:38.500 --> 22:40.320]  You're gonna wanna wear some sort of goggles
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.300]  that have protection all around.
[22:42.300 --> 22:44.300]  Not the kind of goggles with holes in the side for air,
[22:44.300 --> 22:46.140]  but the ones that protect your face.
[22:46.140 --> 22:48.240]  You should also wear protective gear
[22:48.240 --> 22:49.980]  when you're mixing your nutrients.
[22:49.980 --> 22:52.540]  Certainly wear those goggles when you're mixing a pesticide.
[22:52.540 --> 22:53.900]  It only takes one little splash.
[22:53.900 --> 22:56.700]  Imagine you're pouring, I'm just gonna pick evergreen.
[22:56.700 --> 22:58.800]  Imagine you've got some evergreen or some pyganic,
[22:59.720 --> 23:01.280]  you're pouring it from the bottle
[23:01.280 --> 23:03.560]  into whatever you're gonna pour it into to spray.
[23:03.560 --> 23:06.480]  One drop, just when that liquid hits the other liquid
[23:06.480 --> 23:09.400]  and it drops and splashes, one drop into your eye,
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.520]  you're going to the eye doctor,
[23:10.520 --> 23:11.680]  you're fucked up for a little bit.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.640]  It's gonna get expensive, it's gonna hurt,
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.840]  it's gonna ruin your day.
[23:14.840 --> 23:16.080]  Now you've got an incident report
[23:16.080 --> 23:17.520]  if you're at a commercial grow,
[23:17.520 --> 23:19.080]  you got paper to fill out.
[23:19.080 --> 23:21.760]  Now you gotta explain how you got evergreen in your eye.
[23:21.760 --> 23:23.880]  It's not a good idea to get shit in your eye.
[23:23.880 --> 23:25.800]  Wear protective equipment.
[23:25.800 --> 23:27.960]  Also, a lot of pesticides will require
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.600]  some sort of a respirator.
[23:29.600 --> 23:32.480]  It's a good idea to go get an expensive respirator
[23:32.480 --> 23:34.000]  and keep the cartridges changed.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.080]  Those pink cartridges that pop onto the sides,
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.500]  they're not very expensive.
[23:37.500 --> 23:39.840]  It's well worth your health to change those out.
[23:39.840 --> 23:42.920]  So find out what kind of personal protective equipment
[23:42.920 --> 23:45.620]  you need for the pesticides that you plan on applying
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.280]  and get them.
[23:47.280 --> 23:48.640]  It's well worth the money.
[23:48.640 --> 23:50.840]  If you work in a commercial grow,
[23:50.840 --> 23:53.520]  beyond the long sleeve shirt, pants, shoes, and socks,
[23:53.520 --> 23:55.320]  it's up to your employer to provide
[23:55.320 --> 23:57.440]  proper personal protective equipment.
[23:57.960 --> 24:00.960]  It's up to them to get you a respirator, goggles,
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.140]  maybe a Tyvek suit.
[24:02.140 --> 24:04.900]  I recommend a Tyvek suit if you're spraying pesticides.
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.360]  They aren't very expensive.
[24:06.360 --> 24:07.920]  The Department of Ag does require
[24:07.920 --> 24:10.000]  that you throw them away after each use.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.260]  If you're gonna use it for your own personal grow,
[24:12.260 --> 24:13.680]  maybe you can use it a couple of times.
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.840]  I can't say much about that
[24:14.840 --> 24:16.940]  because I'm trained on how to teach you
[24:16.940 --> 24:17.780]  how to do it correctly.
[24:17.780 --> 24:19.580]  So I'm supposed to tell you throw those away
[24:19.580 --> 24:22.360]  after each use if you use them in a commercial setting.
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.900]  The reason for that is because it's got pesticide on it.
[24:24.900 --> 24:26.120]  How are you going to store it?
[24:26.120 --> 24:28.480]  Where is it going to be until you use it next time?
[24:28.480 --> 24:30.400]  How are you not going to spread pesticides
[24:30.400 --> 24:33.360]  from that to your skin when you're getting out of it
[24:33.360 --> 24:34.480]  and putting it on next time?
[24:34.480 --> 24:35.720]  There are concerns with that.
[24:35.720 --> 24:38.160]  How much pesticide is going to penetrate that suit
[24:38.160 --> 24:39.560]  while it is sitting there?
[24:39.560 --> 24:42.940]  A lot of it is not just the pesticide that's a contaminant,
[24:42.940 --> 24:45.320]  but the solvent that carries the pesticide.
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.400]  Because maybe whatever you're spraying
[24:47.400 --> 24:48.400]  is not always a liquid.
[24:48.400 --> 24:50.520]  They have to put it in a liquid to carry it.
[24:50.520 --> 24:53.180]  Sometimes that's a solvent and will cause problems.
[24:53.180 --> 24:57.220]  Which reminds me to tell you that if you are mixing
[24:57.220 --> 24:58.940]  and applying a pesticide,
[24:58.940 --> 25:02.060]  that those nitrile gloves we're buying at the grocery store
[25:02.060 --> 25:03.540]  or that we're getting at,
[25:03.540 --> 25:05.500]  what's the place called over there, Harbor Freight,
[25:05.500 --> 25:07.160]  or that you're buying from Uline,
[25:07.160 --> 25:10.500]  those are probably not approved by the EPA.
[25:10.500 --> 25:13.900]  You need a 15 mil or thicker glove
[25:13.900 --> 25:16.180]  if you're going to be mixing and applying pesticides.
[25:16.180 --> 25:18.080]  The gloves that we are probably using
[25:18.080 --> 25:20.340]  are probably around six mils, you guys.
[25:20.340 --> 25:21.700]  The ones you're getting from Harbor Freight
[25:21.700 --> 25:23.740]  that you get from Uline or the grocery store,
[25:23.740 --> 25:24.980]  those are six mil gloves.
[25:24.980 --> 25:27.680]  You need 15 mil, I think they're millimeters,
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.660]  15 millimeters thick to prevent from a pesticide
[25:31.660 --> 25:33.380]  leaking through that glove.
[25:33.380 --> 25:35.300]  That's something that the Department of Agriculture
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.980]  and the EPA recommend.
[25:36.980 --> 25:38.840]  So to get myself back on track, read the bottle.
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.240]  When you peel back that little booklet on the bottle,
[25:41.240 --> 25:43.520]  it's gonna tell you what personal protective equipment
[25:43.520 --> 25:45.540]  is required to use that pesticide.
[25:45.540 --> 25:48.900]  I recommend you use all of the stuff it recommends.
[25:48.900 --> 25:53.020]  Also, it's going to have what's called a re-entry interval.
[25:53.020 --> 25:56.420]  It's going to tell you how long after the application ends,
[25:56.420 --> 25:59.860]  how long you need to wait before somebody re-enters
[25:59.860 --> 26:02.860]  that room, and that's from the time you stop spraying.
[26:02.860 --> 26:04.380]  So if you're spraying, spraying, spraying,
[26:04.380 --> 26:06.740]  when you stop now, that's when you can start the timer.
[26:06.740 --> 26:08.660]  Most of the products that we are using,
[26:08.660 --> 26:11.380]  they usually have a four-hour re-entry interval,
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.660]  which is not too long.
[26:12.660 --> 26:14.520]  So you do most of your work, you turn off the lights,
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.740]  you spray the plants, then you gotta wait four hours
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.860]  before you can go back in there and turn them on.
[26:19.700 --> 26:20.660]  There is stuff that you can do if you need to go
[26:20.660 --> 26:22.260]  in there early, you would do what's called
[26:22.260 --> 26:23.860]  an early re-entry.
[26:23.860 --> 26:25.380]  You're gonna probably have to suit up,
[26:25.380 --> 26:26.900]  you're gonna need gloves.
[26:26.900 --> 26:28.660]  If you're going to come in contact with the plants,
[26:28.660 --> 26:31.420]  you need all of the proper personal protective equipment.
[26:31.420 --> 26:32.940]  You need to suit up and be safe in there
[26:32.940 --> 26:35.940]  so that you don't come in contact with these pesticides
[26:35.940 --> 26:36.900]  and end up spreading them.
[26:36.900 --> 26:40.420]  That's something we're gonna talk about in the next rant.
[26:40.420 --> 26:42.560]  So also inside that little booklet is going to have
[26:42.560 --> 26:44.300]  all the instructions of what to do
[26:44.300 --> 26:46.740]  if you do mess up with this pesticide.
[26:46.740 --> 26:48.380]  If you spill it, if you get some in your eye,
[26:49.220 --> 26:50.060]  if you get some in your mouth,
[26:50.060 --> 26:50.880]  or if you get some on your skin,
[26:50.880 --> 26:52.620]  all of what to do will be listed
[26:52.620 --> 26:54.820]  on the booklet inside of there.
[26:54.820 --> 26:57.420]  Read that before you use the pesticide, why not?
[26:57.420 --> 26:59.500]  Why not have some sort of idea what's gonna happen
[26:59.500 --> 27:00.980]  if you do fuck up?
[27:00.980 --> 27:03.260]  I know everybody thinks I'm not gonna get this in my eye,
[27:03.260 --> 27:05.900]  I'm not gonna get it in my mouth, but shit happens.
[27:05.900 --> 27:08.100]  We never plan on getting into a car accident,
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.620]  we never plan on making mistakes,
[27:09.620 --> 27:11.180]  we never plan on having accidents,
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.860]  that's why they're called accidents, shit happens.
[27:13.860 --> 27:15.860]  Read the label, find out what could happen,
[27:15.860 --> 27:17.260]  find out what you may need to do,
[27:17.260 --> 27:18.580]  especially if you're alone,
[27:18.580 --> 27:20.060]  especially if there's nobody else around,
[27:20.060 --> 27:23.700]  if you're far from places or whatever, be prepared.
[27:23.700 --> 27:25.900]  I highly recommend that you put the phone number
[27:25.900 --> 27:27.560]  to Poison Control in your phone,
[27:27.560 --> 27:29.660]  it's a very easy number to find.
[27:29.660 --> 27:30.820]  In fact, here, I'll make it easy
[27:30.820 --> 27:32.580]  so nobody has to search for it.
[27:32.580 --> 27:34.860]  The phone number for the American Association
[27:34.860 --> 27:39.860]  of Poison Control Centers is 1-800-222-1222.
[27:42.220 --> 27:44.100]  That's 1222 at the end there,
[27:44.100 --> 27:45.480]  I fucked that up a little for you.
[27:46.100 --> 27:49.200]  I'll do it again, it's 1-800-222-1222.
[27:49.200 --> 27:51.080]  That's the Poison Control Center.
[27:51.080 --> 27:53.380]  Put that in your phone if you've ever got a problem.
[27:53.380 --> 27:55.320]  Hopefully you've got some voice dialing,
[27:55.320 --> 27:56.800]  you can hold down the button and you can say,
[27:56.800 --> 27:58.920]  I need poison control, they'll call you,
[27:58.920 --> 28:01.000]  or you can call that and they'll help you
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.440]  figure out if you need to go to the hospital,
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.680]  if you need to flush your stomach,
[28:03.680 --> 28:05.440]  if you need to puke, if you need to not puke,
[28:05.440 --> 28:07.240]  if you need to rinse your eyes out,
[28:07.240 --> 28:08.920]  if you need to just set yourself on fire.
[28:08.920 --> 28:10.960]  They'll be able to explain what you need to do,
[28:10.960 --> 28:12.520]  it will certainly help you out.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.880]  Put that number in your phone.
[28:14.360 --> 28:15.800]  Read what could go on.
[28:15.800 --> 28:17.120]  Think about this, you're spraying,
[28:17.120 --> 28:19.480]  maybe you're just spraying, I keep saying evergreen,
[28:19.480 --> 28:22.280]  or maybe, I don't know what you're gonna use in your grow.
[28:22.280 --> 28:24.920]  I was talking about evergreen recently, so it's on my mind.
[28:24.920 --> 28:27.200]  Let's say you're applying whatever pesticide
[28:27.200 --> 28:29.120]  you're applying with a sprayer,
[28:29.120 --> 28:30.440]  and you forgot to turn off a fan.
[28:30.440 --> 28:31.960]  And you spray it and it hits that fan
[28:31.960 --> 28:33.760]  and it just blows right back into your eyeballs
[28:33.760 --> 28:35.660]  because you're not wearing protective equipment
[28:35.660 --> 28:36.560]  for your eyeballs.
[28:36.560 --> 28:38.520]  Now you gotta figure out what to do.
[28:38.520 --> 28:39.780]  But now your eyes are all fucked up,
[28:39.780 --> 28:42.000]  so now you can't read that label, you're by yourself.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.240]  What are you gonna do?
[28:43.240 --> 28:44.280]  Are you gonna call one of your friends?
[28:44.280 --> 28:45.200]  Are you gonna call 911?
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.900]  Are you gonna call poison control?
[28:46.900 --> 28:48.320]  If you would've read the label before,
[28:48.320 --> 28:50.280]  you'd have a little bit of an idea what to do.
[28:50.280 --> 28:52.240]  The proper thing to do would probably be
[28:52.240 --> 28:53.520]  to start flushing your eyes.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.920]  So everybody, this may sound crazy,
[28:55.920 --> 28:58.240]  I highly recommend having some sort of an eye wash
[28:58.240 --> 29:00.280]  or an eye flush in your grow,
[29:00.280 --> 29:02.040]  near your pesticides, near something.
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.320]  Don't put it near the pesticides.
[29:03.320 --> 29:04.200]  Scratch that I said that,
[29:04.200 --> 29:05.040]  because you don't wanna fuck up
[29:05.040 --> 29:07.720]  and go thinking that you're pouring some rinse in your eye
[29:07.720 --> 29:09.540]  and end up pouring more evergreen in there.
[29:09.540 --> 29:11.720]  Keep it in your back pocket, keep it somewhere safe.
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.520]  You just need some water to rinse your eyes out.
[29:13.520 --> 29:14.760]  That'd be a really good idea.
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.520]  So be prepared, think about that shit.
[29:16.520 --> 29:17.480]  Accidents do happen.
[29:17.480 --> 29:19.760]  Read the labels of every product you're using.
[29:19.760 --> 29:21.000]  That may also change your mind
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.520]  on if you wanna use it in your garden or not.
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.760]  All right, so you've read the label,
[29:24.760 --> 29:26.500]  you have properly mixed your pesticide,
[29:26.500 --> 29:28.160]  you wore the proper protective equipment
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.440]  while you were mixing it, you've applied it properly,
[29:31.440 --> 29:34.340]  then you were awaiting the proper re-interval time
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.280]  before you go in there and check on how everything went.
[29:36.280 --> 29:37.920]  You wanna know if those plants got fried
[29:37.920 --> 29:40.000]  or if you killed the bugs or if they look better,
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.800]  or you just wanna go in there and get back to work.
[29:41.800 --> 29:43.280]  You gotta wait a little bit of time.
[29:43.280 --> 29:45.920]  Now, the thing to do after you have applied these pesticides
[29:45.920 --> 29:47.200]  is to carefully take off
[29:47.200 --> 29:49.040]  all of your personal protective equipment
[29:49.040 --> 29:50.840]  and clean yourself.
[29:50.840 --> 29:52.060]  If you're wearing a respirator,
[29:52.060 --> 29:55.000]  think about when you grab that respirator to take it off,
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.080]  do you have pesticides on your hands or gloves
[29:57.080 --> 29:58.480]  that you're gonna rub onto your face
[29:58.480 --> 30:00.320]  that's gonna move up into your eye?
[30:00.320 --> 30:01.960]  Think about when you go scratching your face
[30:01.960 --> 30:04.660]  or balls or wherever, are you spreading pesticide?
[30:04.660 --> 30:07.640]  Take your gloves off, take your suit off in a proper order
[30:07.640 --> 30:08.840]  to where you're not spreading shit.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.960]  You wanna take off the gloves
[30:09.960 --> 30:11.280]  because it's all over your hands.
[30:11.280 --> 30:13.280]  Then you wanna grab the respirator and take that off.
[30:13.280 --> 30:15.040]  And then you wanna take off the clothing.
[30:15.040 --> 30:17.640]  And you wanna clean your hands very well
[30:17.640 --> 30:20.480]  before you eat, drink, smoke, use gum or tobacco,
[30:20.480 --> 30:21.920]  or go to the bathroom.
[30:21.920 --> 30:23.600]  Because, let me explain why going to the bathroom
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.440]  is a big deal.
[30:24.440 --> 30:26.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, your genitals, your junk,
[30:26.520 --> 30:29.000]  is the most absorbive, absorb,
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.060]  what the fuck's the word I'm trying to say?
[30:31.060 --> 30:33.200]  Anyway, let me rephrase it so it makes more sense.
[30:33.200 --> 30:35.480]  Your genitals will absorb more pesticides
[30:35.480 --> 30:37.780]  than any other part of the skin on your body.
[30:37.780 --> 30:38.800]  It's a little softer.
[30:39.640 --> 30:41.640]  It has more mucous membranes, more nerves, more veins.
[30:41.640 --> 30:42.960]  It'll suck up more of the pesticides.
[30:42.960 --> 30:44.560]  So wash your hands before you grab your junk
[30:44.560 --> 30:45.680]  and go to the bathroom.
[30:45.680 --> 30:47.080]  Certainly wash your hands before you eat
[30:47.080 --> 30:48.320]  or drink anything.
[30:48.320 --> 30:50.880]  And if you're gonna smoke or chew gum or tobacco,
[30:50.880 --> 30:51.720]  certainly wash your hands.
[30:51.720 --> 30:53.760]  You don't wanna get those pesticides in your mouth
[30:53.760 --> 30:55.640]  or in anything you're eating, drinking, or smoking.
[30:55.640 --> 30:57.340]  Most of them taste like shit anyway,
[30:57.340 --> 30:59.060]  but they're toxic, you don't want that.
[30:59.060 --> 31:00.680]  So think about it when you're unsuiting
[31:00.680 --> 31:01.760]  after you've sprayed.
[31:01.760 --> 31:05.040]  Do it in the proper order so that you don't spread stuff.
[31:05.040 --> 31:06.840]  Wash your hands thoroughly.
[31:06.840 --> 31:08.280]  Put all of your dirty clothing,
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.640]  all of your dirty gear somewhere
[31:09.640 --> 31:11.560]  that it doesn't get washed with your family's
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.480]  normal clothing.
[31:12.480 --> 31:15.780]  You don't wanna wash whatever your spouse,
[31:15.780 --> 31:18.300]  your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your mom,
[31:18.300 --> 31:19.640]  your baby, your family.
[31:19.640 --> 31:21.340]  You don't wanna wash your clothes
[31:21.340 --> 31:23.600]  that have pesticides in it with their clothes.
[31:23.600 --> 31:25.720]  So think about that.
[31:25.720 --> 31:27.400]  Wash your clothes in the washer separately,
[31:27.400 --> 31:30.120]  then run it with hot water again or cool water to rinse it
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.560]  if you don't wanna waste hot water.
[31:31.560 --> 31:33.920]  Then wash everybody else's clothes after that.
[31:33.920 --> 31:36.800]  Don't go washing straight one after the other
[31:36.800 --> 31:38.200]  because you just wanna clean it out,
[31:38.200 --> 31:39.560]  that's what I'm saying.
[31:39.560 --> 31:41.080]  We're trying not to spread pesticides.
[31:41.080 --> 31:43.720]  Let's get to the part that I've labeled pesticide spread
[31:43.720 --> 31:46.360]  in my little note here on my iPad.
[31:46.360 --> 31:47.980]  Pesticide spread.
[31:47.980 --> 31:49.440]  Think about this.
[31:49.440 --> 31:51.920]  Imagine if we put just a little bit of dye
[31:51.920 --> 31:53.680]  inside of the pesticide sprayer,
[31:53.680 --> 31:55.480]  whatever you use as a pesticide sprayer.
[31:55.480 --> 31:57.560]  Imagine if I dropped what's called tracer dye in there.
[31:57.560 --> 32:00.280]  Tracer dye is clear, it's invisible to the naked eye,
[32:00.280 --> 32:03.420]  but if I shine a black light over it, it will show up.
[32:03.420 --> 32:05.400]  It'll show up like DNA on a blanket.
[32:05.920 --> 32:07.640]  We put some of this tracer dye
[32:07.640 --> 32:09.020]  inside of the pesticide sprayer
[32:09.020 --> 32:10.880]  and then you apply your pesticides.
[32:10.880 --> 32:12.540]  Then go shine that light everywhere.
[32:12.540 --> 32:13.800]  It's gonna be on the plants.
[32:13.800 --> 32:15.700]  The pesticide is going to be on the walls.
[32:15.700 --> 32:16.720]  It's gonna be on the pots.
[32:16.720 --> 32:18.040]  It's gonna be on the floors.
[32:18.040 --> 32:21.000]  It's also going to be on your shoes, your hands.
[32:21.000 --> 32:22.200]  It's gonna be on the fans.
[32:22.200 --> 32:23.800]  It's gonna be everywhere.
[32:23.800 --> 32:26.860]  So that pesticide has now gotten all over your grow room
[32:26.860 --> 32:28.120]  if you're in an indoor environment.
[32:28.120 --> 32:29.540]  It's on the walls, it's on the ceiling,
[32:29.540 --> 32:30.840]  it's on the light reflectors.
[32:30.840 --> 32:31.880]  It is everywhere.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.200]  You don't wanna walk out of that grow
[32:35.960 --> 32:39.200]  and those shoes and spread that pesticide into your car
[32:39.200 --> 32:41.840]  and then put those pesticides into your house
[32:41.840 --> 32:44.220]  because it's on your shirt, it's on your arms.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.640]  It's everywhere.
[32:45.640 --> 32:47.560]  You don't need to bring that home to your pets,
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.300]  to your family, to your children,
[32:49.300 --> 32:51.980]  anybody that is sick that may compromise their health.
[32:51.980 --> 32:53.640]  So if you're going to apply pesticides,
[32:53.640 --> 32:55.600]  please have a dedicated set of clothing
[32:55.600 --> 32:58.280]  or like I said earlier, hopefully possibly a Tyvek suit.
[32:58.280 --> 32:59.280]  They're not that expensive.
[32:59.280 --> 33:00.160]  If you're growing cannabis,
[33:00.160 --> 33:02.560]  you can probably afford a couple of Tyvek suits.
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.440]  Hopefully that fits in your budget.
[33:05.440 --> 33:07.040]  But think about pesticide spread.
[33:07.040 --> 33:08.640]  You don't wanna bring pesticides home
[33:08.640 --> 33:09.920]  to your family and your pets.
[33:09.920 --> 33:11.480]  So have a dedicated set of clothing.
[33:11.480 --> 33:13.000]  Also think about this.
[33:13.000 --> 33:14.480]  You've applied pesticides.
[33:14.480 --> 33:16.240]  Now you go back in there and you work.
[33:16.240 --> 33:17.920]  You were rubbing up against those plants
[33:17.920 --> 33:19.400]  that have been treated with a pesticide.
[33:19.400 --> 33:21.440]  Those walls have pesticides like I said.
[33:21.440 --> 33:24.960]  Everything in there is now a pesticide contamination zone.
[33:24.960 --> 33:27.120]  You may wanna wear long sleeves in your grow
[33:27.120 --> 33:28.840]  and you may wanna take those clothes off
[33:28.840 --> 33:30.220]  before you go anywhere else.
[33:30.220 --> 33:32.940]  You may wanna shower before you go anywhere else.
[33:32.940 --> 33:34.480]  Just think about pesticide spread.
[33:34.480 --> 33:36.160]  It's gonna make a lot of people paranoid
[33:36.160 --> 33:37.660]  because a lot of people have been spraying
[33:37.660 --> 33:40.260]  pesticide willy nilly for the past 100 years
[33:40.260 --> 33:41.780]  and haven't been thinking about it.
[33:41.780 --> 33:44.240]  It's time to think about it you guys.
[33:44.240 --> 33:45.080]  We don't wanna get sick.
[33:45.080 --> 33:46.880]  We don't wanna make other people sick
[33:46.880 --> 33:47.780]  and we wanna be safe.
[33:47.780 --> 33:49.500]  We wanna keep the environment healthy.
[33:49.500 --> 33:50.340]  It's all about good health.
[33:50.340 --> 33:52.900]  We're growing cannabis to save people's lives.
[33:52.900 --> 33:54.060]  We don't wanna make ourselves
[33:54.060 --> 33:56.800]  and other people sick in the process.
[33:56.800 --> 33:58.440]  One more thing I wanna touch on
[33:58.440 --> 33:59.980]  while I'm talking about the trace or die.
[34:00.740 --> 34:02.500]  Think about when you're washing your hands and cleaning up.
[34:02.500 --> 34:03.860]  If you shine the light over the sink
[34:03.860 --> 34:04.900]  where you're cleaning up,
[34:04.900 --> 34:07.620]  the knobs are probably going to show the trace or die.
[34:07.620 --> 34:08.980]  The sink where you were cleaning up
[34:08.980 --> 34:10.900]  is going to probably have trace or die.
[34:10.900 --> 34:14.300]  You're going to need to clean up the cleanup area as well.
[34:14.300 --> 34:16.960]  And I also recommend cleaning up your respirator.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.940]  I would not recommend reusing the gloves.
[34:18.940 --> 34:20.140]  Those are a one-time use thing.
[34:20.140 --> 34:22.540]  Most of the time those 15 mil latex gloves
[34:22.540 --> 34:25.220]  or the nitrile or that butyl or whatever it's called.
[34:25.220 --> 34:26.500]  I can't think of the word right now.
[34:26.500 --> 34:27.660]  I think those are a one-time use.
[34:27.660 --> 34:29.300]  You're gonna have to get rid of those.
[34:29.300 --> 34:31.060]  The reason is they don't want them turning inside out
[34:31.060 --> 34:32.460]  when you swap them out.
[34:32.460 --> 34:34.100]  I learned so much at this pesticide class,
[34:34.100 --> 34:36.540]  you guys, that I just feel like I'm a pesticide nerd now.
[34:36.540 --> 34:38.300]  But the reason they don't want them turning inside out
[34:38.300 --> 34:39.940]  when you take it off and on,
[34:39.940 --> 34:41.260]  because then you're gonna get the pesticide
[34:41.260 --> 34:43.740]  right back on you and that's what we're trying to prevent.
[34:43.740 --> 34:45.300]  So be very careful.
[34:45.300 --> 34:46.180]  Clean up your equipment.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.400]  Clean up after yourself.
[34:47.400 --> 34:49.180]  Be safe with the pesticides.
[34:49.180 --> 34:50.700]  Here's a very useful hint
[34:50.700 --> 34:53.660]  that the instructor of the class taught me.
[34:53.660 --> 34:55.060]  She said if you spill something,
[34:55.060 --> 34:57.780]  kitty litter is probably the easiest way to clean it up.
[34:57.780 --> 34:59.060]  Sprinkle some kitty litter on it.
[34:59.820 --> 35:02.380]  The kitty litter will absorb the liquid
[35:02.380 --> 35:03.760]  and then you can put that.
[35:03.760 --> 35:05.440]  You're gonna have to dispose of it properly
[35:05.440 --> 35:06.500]  because it's a pesticide.
[35:06.500 --> 35:07.420]  It's going to have to go
[35:07.420 --> 35:09.340]  into the hazardous waste container somehow.
[35:09.340 --> 35:10.980]  You cannot pour it down a drain.
[35:12.100 --> 35:13.620]  Excuse me, you cannot pour it down a drain.
[35:13.620 --> 35:15.140]  You can't dump it in the backyard.
[35:15.140 --> 35:17.200]  That needs to be disposed of properly.
[35:17.200 --> 35:19.560]  A lot of areas do a disposal thing.
[35:19.560 --> 35:21.860]  Once a year they have a big party at a park or something
[35:21.860 --> 35:23.880]  where you're allowed to come bring all your shit like that.
[35:23.880 --> 35:25.020]  If you've got a small home grow,
[35:25.020 --> 35:26.420]  that's a great way to get rid of it.
[35:26.420 --> 35:27.620]  If you've got a commercial grow,
[35:27.620 --> 35:30.540]  you're going to have to pay for hazardous chemical removal.
[35:30.540 --> 35:33.540]  So you can clean up shit with a thing of kitty litter.
[35:33.540 --> 35:34.780]  If you get a hole in a bottle,
[35:34.780 --> 35:36.780]  you can drop a chunk of kitty litter in the bottle
[35:36.780 --> 35:37.980]  and it will expand in the hole.
[35:37.980 --> 35:40.160]  It'll kind of cause a little temporary seal.
[35:40.160 --> 35:41.940]  Put a piece of duct tape on the outside.
[35:41.940 --> 35:44.700]  You can probably make that bottle last a little bit longer.
[35:44.700 --> 35:46.620]  When you are done with the pesticide bottle,
[35:46.620 --> 35:48.540]  you're supposed to rinse it out three times
[35:48.540 --> 35:50.040]  so that it is clean.
[35:50.040 --> 35:52.780]  Once again, they were never clear about where to rinse that
[35:52.780 --> 35:55.540]  because you can't pour that rinse down the drain.
[35:55.540 --> 35:56.920]  Probably put it into a sprayer
[35:56.960 --> 35:59.160]  and spray it onto some plants if necessary,
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.400]  but you're supposed to rinse the bottle three times
[36:01.400 --> 36:02.840]  and then you're supposed to poke holes in it
[36:02.840 --> 36:04.240]  so that if somebody finds that container,
[36:04.240 --> 36:05.400]  they don't try to drink out of it
[36:05.400 --> 36:08.180]  or use it as a vessel for a beverage or something.
[36:08.180 --> 36:10.480]  But anyway, that's a little excessive.
[36:10.480 --> 36:12.520]  Anyway, trace or die, it'll teach you a lot.
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.400]  Let's talk about disposal of pesticides.
[36:14.400 --> 36:15.760]  You guys, when you are done spraying,
[36:15.760 --> 36:17.280]  when you're done applying a pesticide,
[36:17.280 --> 36:18.640]  you've got some leftover.
[36:18.640 --> 36:19.600]  Like I said earlier,
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.720]  you are not supposed to dump that down the toilet,
[36:21.720 --> 36:22.640]  down the drain.
[36:22.640 --> 36:24.720]  It's not supposed to go in the dumpster.
[36:24.720 --> 36:26.480]  That is now hazardous waste
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.600]  that needs to be disposed of properly.
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.480]  Please dispose of it properly.
[36:30.480 --> 36:32.160]  The best thing you could probably do
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.080]  is learn exactly how much pesticide you need to mix up.
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.520]  Mix up that much and spray that much
[36:37.520 --> 36:38.720]  and don't have any leftover.
[36:38.720 --> 36:39.920]  I know that sounds like a challenge.
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.000]  It's gonna take two or three,
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.520]  maybe four or five tries before you get it right,
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.020]  but please just learn how much you need.
[36:46.020 --> 36:48.400]  Mix up the proper amount, apply it.
[36:48.400 --> 36:49.240]  And then if you need to,
[36:49.240 --> 36:50.760]  just spray the rest of it on the plants.
[36:50.760 --> 36:51.920]  Maybe it's a little excessive,
[36:51.920 --> 36:53.720]  but or you can find another crop
[36:53.720 --> 36:55.160]  that it's acceptable to spray that on.
[36:55.160 --> 36:57.440]  If you've got other plants outside,
[36:57.440 --> 36:59.320]  you can spray those plants with that pesticide,
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.320]  but don't go crazy.
[37:00.320 --> 37:01.920]  Just spraying pesticides on random shit
[37:01.920 --> 37:02.760]  because you have it.
[37:02.760 --> 37:04.560]  Please, that's excessive and ridiculous.
[37:04.560 --> 37:05.400]  Just be careful.
[37:05.400 --> 37:06.760]  Don't be wasteful with pesticides
[37:06.760 --> 37:08.480]  and learn how to mix up what you need
[37:08.480 --> 37:10.960]  and how to just properly dispose of what you don't need,
[37:10.960 --> 37:12.080]  which is just waste.
[37:12.080 --> 37:14.000]  So just learn how to mix it properly anyway.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.120]  When you work in a commercial grill like I do,
[37:16.120 --> 37:17.400]  we've got at least 100 lights.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.680]  We're working on another facility with 400 lights.
[37:19.680 --> 37:21.200]  They are next door to each other.
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.560]  So it'll basically be me running a 500 light project.
[37:24.560 --> 37:27.120]  We are very careful when we mix up pesticides.
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.020]  We're learning how much each room needs
[37:29.020 --> 37:30.880]  if we're going to apply something.
[37:30.880 --> 37:33.240]  We're learning how much water we need to water each room
[37:33.240 --> 37:34.900]  because if we mix up too much nutrients,
[37:34.900 --> 37:37.600]  we have to get rid of that properly as well.
[37:37.600 --> 37:39.560]  So think about that type of stuff.
[37:39.560 --> 37:41.080]  The earth, hopefully,
[37:41.080 --> 37:42.560]  you never know with the way shit's going,
[37:42.560 --> 37:44.240]  but hopefully this earth is going to be here
[37:44.240 --> 37:45.840]  much longer than you or I
[37:45.840 --> 37:48.740]  and our children and their children and their children.
[37:48.740 --> 37:50.440]  Hopefully this earth sticks around.
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.080]  Do your part to make it pretty
[37:52.080 --> 37:54.360]  for your grandchildren's grandchildren.
[37:54.360 --> 37:55.180]  You know what I'm saying?
[37:55.180 --> 37:57.280]  Don't be a selfish bitch with your pesticides
[37:57.280 --> 37:59.520]  and your nutrients or whatever you're doing.
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.880]  Try to keep it clean for our kids
[38:00.880 --> 38:03.260]  because they need somewhere to be also.
[38:03.260 --> 38:05.000]  Damn, I've been ranting for a long time, you guys.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.520]  I appreciate you for listening to me.
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.100]  I hope you're learning something about pesticides
[38:08.100 --> 38:09.900]  because it is a very serious issue.
[38:09.900 --> 38:13.360]  That's very overlooked in commercial grills, in my opinion.
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.060]  I feel like everybody that was in the class,
[38:15.060 --> 38:17.080]  there were 16 people in the class.
[38:17.080 --> 38:19.240]  Four or five of them were actually dispensary
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.100]  and grow owners.
[38:20.760 --> 38:23.540]  The rest of them were grow managers or cultivation managers
[38:23.540 --> 38:25.980]  or somebody that was responsible for applying pesticides
[38:25.980 --> 38:26.820]  in a commercial grill.
[38:26.820 --> 38:28.180]  It was all marijuana people.
[38:29.420 --> 38:31.260]  A lot of the people, everybody in the class
[38:31.260 --> 38:33.540]  seemed to have one of those, oh my goodness moments
[38:33.540 --> 38:35.020]  where we all learned something.
[38:35.020 --> 38:37.380]  Several of my questions were answered.
[38:37.380 --> 38:38.420]  It was a great class.
[38:38.420 --> 38:39.980]  So I hope you guys learned something from me.
[38:39.980 --> 38:40.980]  Also at the beginning of the show,
[38:40.980 --> 38:43.840]  I did not mention that the event was also sponsored
[38:43.840 --> 38:46.900]  by the MIG, the Marijuana Investors Group
[38:46.900 --> 38:48.220]  is what I think that stands for.
[38:48.220 --> 38:51.060]  I left them out when I described who hosted the class.
[38:51.060 --> 38:52.300]  I apologize for that.
[38:52.300 --> 38:53.140]  It was a great class.
[38:53.140 --> 38:53.960]  I would recommend it.
[38:53.960 --> 38:56.920]  If you work in a marijuana enforcement division,
[38:56.920 --> 38:59.220]  regulated grow, or if you work in any sort of
[38:59.220 --> 39:02.600]  agricultural place where there are pesticides applied,
[39:02.600 --> 39:05.780]  I think you would learn a lot from taking this class.
[39:05.780 --> 39:07.380]  It was only $65.
[39:07.380 --> 39:09.120]  If you need a link, let me know.
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.020]  I can set you up with Thea, the host of the class,
[39:11.020 --> 39:12.460]  and she can let you know when there's time
[39:12.460 --> 39:14.500]  and room for you to get in.
[39:14.500 --> 39:15.620]  It's well worth it.
[39:15.620 --> 39:18.300]  This time it was at the cash register building in Denver.
[39:18.300 --> 39:21.780]  The hardest part is finding somewhere to fucking park.
[39:21.780 --> 39:24.980]  If you work in a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
[39:24.980 --> 39:26.980]  regulated facility, you are actually required
[39:26.980 --> 39:29.660]  to be worker protection safety trained.
[39:29.660 --> 39:31.520]  It is your employer's responsibility.
[39:31.520 --> 39:34.620]  If you touch plants, you need to be worker trained.
[39:34.620 --> 39:37.460]  If you apply pesticides, you need to be handler trained
[39:37.460 --> 39:39.340]  is what I think it's called.
[39:39.340 --> 39:41.100]  You need to have that done very soon
[39:41.100 --> 39:42.580]  before the Department of Ag comes in
[39:42.580 --> 39:44.900]  and does an inspection on your grow.
[39:44.900 --> 39:47.420]  It would be a good idea if you have a grow in Colorado
[39:47.420 --> 39:49.460]  to call the Department of Ag and schedule
[39:49.460 --> 39:51.260]  what is called a compliance check.
[39:51.260 --> 39:54.220]  They'll come and make sure that you're compliant
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.460]  before they come in and bust you.
[39:55.460 --> 39:57.540]  That way they can show you all the shit you're doing wrong
[39:57.540 --> 39:58.720]  and you can correct it.
[39:58.720 --> 40:00.100]  They give you plenty of time.
[40:00.100 --> 40:02.140]  The Department of Ag wants you to get it right there
[40:02.140 --> 40:03.060]  on your side.
[40:03.060 --> 40:05.080]  So I recommend all of that stuff.
[40:05.080 --> 40:08.240]  Honestly, anybody that takes the class that I just spoke of
[40:08.240 --> 40:10.020]  is allowed to train people.
[40:10.020 --> 40:12.560]  I've got all of the training materials right here next to me.
[40:12.680 --> 40:15.080]  I've got two videos, they're on a thumb drive.
[40:15.080 --> 40:16.400]  And also I've got two giant books,
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.080]  one from the Environmental Protection Agency
[40:19.080 --> 40:20.880]  and one from the Colorado Department of Ag
[40:20.880 --> 40:22.680]  sponsored by the Colorado State University.
[40:22.680 --> 40:24.640]  They're big, thick, giant books.
[40:24.640 --> 40:26.340]  I am actually certified.
[40:26.340 --> 40:27.400]  I am trainer certified.
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.080]  I can train anybody in the state of Colorado for one year
[40:31.080 --> 40:33.640]  on how to be worker protection safe.
[40:33.640 --> 40:35.120]  So if you need training, let me know.
[40:35.120 --> 40:37.160]  I'd be happy to come to your facility for a small fee
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.440]  and teach your employees
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.800]  on how to handle these pesticides safely.
[40:40.800 --> 40:41.720]  All right, podcast world.
[40:41.720 --> 40:43.040]  I feel like I am rambling.
[40:43.040 --> 40:44.980]  I'm all jacked up on dabs and Dr. Pepper.
[40:44.980 --> 40:46.480]  I feel like I'm going a million miles an hour.
[40:46.480 --> 40:48.080]  So it's time for me to wrap up the podcast.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.800]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[40:49.800 --> 40:50.720]  Once again, it would be great
[40:50.720 --> 40:52.120]  if you would follow me on social media.
