[00:00.000 --> 00:01.560]  Hey, welcome to the show.
[00:01.560 --> 00:05.320]  It's time for episode 416 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.320 --> 00:08.680]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:08.680 --> 00:14.000]  It is time to add fresh genetics to your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[00:14.000 --> 00:20.420]  and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.420 --> 00:24.480]  Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds on 420, because we are releasing the brand
[00:24.480 --> 00:31.120]  new Blue Raspberry Truffle from Iry Genetics on Oregon Elite Seeds on 420, so don't miss
[00:31.120 --> 00:32.120]  that.
[00:32.120 --> 00:36.240]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:36.240 --> 00:42.000]  I just took a ridiculous chunky dab of Tropicana Cookies Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.700]  I picked up this four gram jar at their Ambrosia Day special over the weekend.
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.600]  I've got just a little bit left.
[00:48.600 --> 00:52.360]  This stuff smells funky, delicious, and perfect.
[00:52.360 --> 00:55.280]  I really like the Tropicana Cookies concentrate.
[00:55.280 --> 00:58.160]  I'm trying to get a good aroma so I can describe it.
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.720]  It is fruity, it smells like Kool-Aid, and it has got a hint of grapefruit to it.
[01:02.720 --> 01:05.440]  It is amazingly delicious, and I do approve.
[01:05.440 --> 01:09.660]  The Tropicana Cookies is quickly becoming one of my favorite concentrates, so big shout
[01:09.660 --> 01:12.360]  out to our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.000]  Alright in this episode, I am going to read some listener emails, but before we get there,
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.900]  let's do a few shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:19.900 --> 01:21.560]  How about a big shout out to our friend Sam?
[01:21.760 --> 01:25.140]  How about a big Viking handshake to our friend Grimble the Druid?
[01:25.140 --> 01:27.180]  I want to give a big shout out to Eric Ross.
[01:27.180 --> 01:29.940]  I owe a big shout out to my friend Richard Memel.
[01:29.940 --> 01:34.580]  A big shout out to Steve F., and of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast to our
[01:34.580 --> 01:37.060]  friend David O. Quinn.
[01:37.060 --> 01:41.980]  Alright podcast world, 420 is quickly approaching and I keep asking for input on the same topic.
[01:41.980 --> 01:45.340]  I want to know, what does 420 mean to you?
[01:45.340 --> 01:51.300]  Send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com or contact me on Twitter at GFYH podcast,
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.160]  and let me know what 420 means to you.
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.560]  Alright podcast world, let's get into this first email for today's episode.
[01:59.560 --> 02:02.040]  This message goes a lot like this.
[02:02.040 --> 02:03.920]  Hello Ross to Jeff.
[02:03.920 --> 02:06.360]  Thank you for all of your help in the herb garden, sir.
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.040]  We have interacted a couple of times before, sort of.
[02:09.040 --> 02:12.920]  I appeared as, and then they actually typed a name in here, but I'm not going to read
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.200]  it out of respect on the show.
[02:14.200 --> 02:17.080]  I want to keep these folks anonymous and keep them safe.
[02:17.080 --> 02:21.540]  He says, I appeared as blank on your old forum just before it went.
[02:21.540 --> 02:27.300]  I also popped up as blank on a recent live chat you did and you corrected my fish spelling.
[02:27.300 --> 02:32.900]  On Patreon, I appear as blank and I guess I have a severe case of internet paranoia
[02:32.900 --> 02:33.900]  due to prohibition.
[02:33.900 --> 02:35.860]  Hey, that is just fine.
[02:35.860 --> 02:38.860]  Sometimes we've got to be safe, we've got to be careful, and we've got to cover our
[02:38.860 --> 02:43.620]  own asses, which is why I've made sure not to reveal any of the names you have listed
[02:43.620 --> 02:44.940]  here in this email.
[02:44.940 --> 02:46.380]  So much respect for that.
[02:46.380 --> 02:47.380]  No stress there.
[02:47.380 --> 02:51.720]  Just keep coming back with a new name, keep following, and I will appreciate your support.
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.720]  The message continues.
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.920]  It says, I was listening to another podcast that also had a Patreon account and they pointed
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.680]  out that people say they will support someone, but then rarely commit to the price of a cup
[03:02.680 --> 03:03.680]  of coffee.
[03:03.680 --> 03:08.680]  I thought to myself, yeah, I definitely owe Ross to Jeff a few brews for all of the help
[03:08.680 --> 03:10.520]  I have received from the show.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.120]  So what's up, good sir?
[03:12.120 --> 03:14.920]  I've got you covered in a small way for one year.
[03:14.920 --> 03:15.920]  Hey, thank you, man.
[03:15.920 --> 03:16.920]  I appreciate that.
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.220]  I have seen your name pop up on Patreon and I try to give you some shout outs discreetly.
[03:21.220 --> 03:22.940]  So a big thanks for that support.
[03:22.940 --> 03:25.060]  I do see you and I do appreciate it.
[03:25.060 --> 03:26.060]  Thanks for the coffee.
[03:26.060 --> 03:28.900]  I don't drink coffee, but you are taking good care of the podcast.
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.820]  You're keeping the podcast up for free.
[03:30.820 --> 03:34.340]  You're providing new microphone cover so I don't have to spit into the same funky cover
[03:34.340 --> 03:35.340]  forever.
[03:35.340 --> 03:39.300]  You're keeping the website updated and you are keeping the internet connection kept on.
[03:39.300 --> 03:41.300]  So I do appreciate stuff like that.
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.640]  Thank you for that help.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.640]  The message continues.
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.140]  He says, just to let you know that with your help, I have grown some seriously dank THC
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.140]  CBD medicine.
[03:50.140 --> 03:55.300]  It was a one to one ratio that has utterly transformed someone's life who was diagnosed
[03:55.300 --> 03:58.260]  with stage four liver and bowel cancer.
[03:58.260 --> 04:00.540]  Now here is the best part of this email.
[04:00.540 --> 04:07.660]  In all capital letters with three exclamation points, the next sentence is, but not anymore.
[04:07.660 --> 04:13.680]  This person does not have stage four liver and bowel cancer anymore because this person
[04:13.680 --> 04:21.500]  was able to grow some seriously dank one to one THC to CBD medicine for this person.
[04:21.500 --> 04:27.120]  The message continues and it says, we stopped it growing and we shrunk the cancers until
[04:27.120 --> 04:30.920]  the doctors could go in and remove what was left.
[04:30.920 --> 04:33.760]  At stage four, this is real.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.360]  And then a bunch of exclamation points.
[04:35.380 --> 04:38.340]  I feel the enthusiasm in the words in this message.
[04:38.340 --> 04:41.620]  I am excited that cannabis is able to do this.
[04:41.620 --> 04:46.140]  And I am excited that with my experience and my guidance and my little podcaster, I'm just
[04:46.140 --> 04:50.540]  talking into a microphone and putting it on the internet and it is making this person's
[04:50.540 --> 04:51.540]  life better.
[04:51.540 --> 04:53.060]  We're making this patient's life better.
[04:53.060 --> 04:54.580]  We're making their caregiver's life better.
[04:54.580 --> 04:58.980]  We're making their entire family and everyone around them, their life is a little bit better
[04:58.980 --> 05:03.460]  because we are able to make one person's life more comfortable and make their life better.
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.520]  And it is just rippling out in a circle and making a lot of people's lives easier and
[05:08.520 --> 05:09.520]  better.
[05:09.520 --> 05:10.800]  So it's amazing that cannabis can do that.
[05:10.800 --> 05:13.960]  I'm proud of you for stepping up and growing this medicine.
[05:13.960 --> 05:17.460]  And I'm proud of you guys for stopping stage four cancer.
[05:17.460 --> 05:18.640]  That is impressive.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.680]  So this message goes on.
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.240]  It says, so thanks again.
[05:21.240 --> 05:24.480]  I will keep listening to the new shows and the old again.
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.360]  I mean the knowledge you have imparted in between the dabs and the guests and the news
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.000]  and all the other great stuff you do on the show is pure gold that only comes from total
[05:33.060 --> 05:34.820]  dedication to your craft.
[05:35.060 --> 05:36.780]  Hey, you are very welcome, my friend.
[05:37.140 --> 05:42.740]  Messages like this, updates and news like this make this podcast make all the energy,
[05:42.740 --> 05:46.340]  the time, the effort, the small expense of paying for a website.
[05:46.860 --> 05:48.620]  All of that is very worth it.
[05:48.740 --> 05:54.700]  When I receive a message saying that my guidance helped somebody beat stage four cancer,
[05:55.080 --> 05:59.700]  I would have done a year of podcasting without any Patreon contributions, without any of
[05:59.700 --> 06:02.660]  the high fives, without the pat on the back reaction.
[06:02.800 --> 06:06.600]  Just to know that we're helping one person with stage four cancer.
[06:06.760 --> 06:10.080]  In the last episode, we talked about a child with autism.
[06:10.200 --> 06:11.560]  So cannabis is helping.
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.880]  And this little podcast is helping people grow better cannabis to help people.
[06:15.880 --> 06:17.400]  So that really means a lot to me.
[06:17.400 --> 06:17.920]  Thank you.
[06:18.120 --> 06:20.320]  There is more to this message, so I'm going to keep going.
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.080]  He said, what?
[06:21.360 --> 06:25.920]  The highest level, professional, cutting edge cannabis specific gardening wisdom at my
[06:25.920 --> 06:27.440]  fingertips for free.
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.120]  Don't mind if I do, sir.
[06:29.360 --> 06:31.160]  Don't mind if I do.
[06:31.380 --> 06:34.900]  And then he says fist bump in parentheses, big old fist bump, bro.
[06:35.060 --> 06:37.620]  And he says, love and light from Manchester, England.
[06:38.180 --> 06:42.300]  It is also great to hear that the podcast is getting such a wide reach.
[06:42.300 --> 06:44.300]  We are being listened to in Manchester, England.
[06:44.340 --> 06:45.980]  I did not know we were getting that far.
[06:45.980 --> 06:47.220]  So that is beautiful to hear.
[06:47.460 --> 06:50.260]  Hey, thank you for the beautiful, amazing message.
[06:50.660 --> 06:51.700]  I know I've said it before.
[06:51.940 --> 06:53.620]  This does mean a lot to me.
[06:53.860 --> 06:55.100]  I put some energy into this show.
[06:55.100 --> 06:56.500]  I put some time into this show.
[06:56.740 --> 06:58.820]  It takes me however long the episode is.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.560]  It took me that plus a little bit longer to record the episode because I probably
[07:02.560 --> 07:05.600]  cut out a few minutes that you didn't hear because I get more rambly than I allow
[07:05.600 --> 07:06.120]  you to hear.
[07:06.560 --> 07:08.560]  Plus it takes however long the show was.
[07:08.600 --> 07:11.920]  I have to listen back to it and edit it just because I want to make sure I took
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.160]  out all the bullshit rambles.
[07:13.480 --> 07:14.880]  Then there is some cleaning up to do.
[07:14.880 --> 07:15.640]  Then I post the show.
[07:15.640 --> 07:16.880]  Of course, I make the video.
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.040]  Then I do the tweeting.
[07:18.240 --> 07:20.160]  Of course, there's the writing and the pre-production.
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.360]  There is a little bit of work to do.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.080]  I'm not trying to complain.
[07:22.080 --> 07:25.160]  I'm just saying there's some work to be done when you've got a podcast that puts
[07:25.160 --> 07:27.560]  out a minimum of two episodes per week.
[07:28.060 --> 07:32.820]  For somebody just to say, hey, with the help of your podcast, we beat stage four
[07:32.820 --> 07:34.340]  cancer, it is all worth it.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.020]  Thank you.
[07:35.100 --> 07:35.900]  That is beautiful.
[07:36.060 --> 07:36.900]  That is amazing.
[07:37.180 --> 07:38.240]  That means the world to me.
[07:38.460 --> 07:40.940]  I can't wait to hear more emails just like this.
[07:40.940 --> 07:44.220]  If you've got them, please send them to me because it really puts a smile on my
[07:44.220 --> 07:47.820]  face and it cheers me up and it shows the power of cannabis.
[07:48.140 --> 07:48.580]  Thank you.
[07:48.620 --> 07:49.700]  I do appreciate this.
[07:50.940 --> 07:51.200]  All right.
[07:51.560 --> 07:52.940]  I'm reaching for the next email.
[07:53.220 --> 07:56.260]  The next email goes a lot like this.
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.280]  Hey, Jeff, I hope all is well with you.
[07:58.480 --> 08:02.800]  I absolutely love your podcast and I have learned a ton from you and white Mike.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.800]  Hey, thanks for listening to the show and check it out, Mike.
[08:04.800 --> 08:05.840]  You're getting another mention.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.640]  So we need to get you back over real soon.
[08:08.400 --> 08:09.160]  The message goes on.
[08:09.160 --> 08:11.400]  It says very much a novice grower here.
[08:11.500 --> 08:15.520]  Last season, I grew two plants from seed through to flower and I have to say the
[08:15.520 --> 08:17.380]  end results did not suck.
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.520]  Well, congratulations, dude.
[08:18.520 --> 08:20.360]  I'm glad they didn't totally suck for you.
[08:20.840 --> 08:25.140]  The message continues and it says, I plan on growing a few more plants this year
[08:25.160 --> 08:27.680]  from seed and I was looking for your advice.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.600]  I will be growing outdoors and five gallon buckets.
[08:31.040 --> 08:31.240]  Okay.
[08:31.240 --> 08:35.120]  First of all, I would recommend a larger pots, five gallon buckets and the thick
[08:35.120 --> 08:36.520]  of summer when it gets real hot.
[08:36.520 --> 08:40.560]  If you're in full sun, you were going to be watering those probably twice a day.
[08:40.760 --> 08:42.080]  I'm not sure if you can do that.
[08:42.080 --> 08:45.760]  I don't know if you've got the access, the time, the energy, the ability, uh,
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.240]  all of the setup to do that.
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.120]  So maybe think about larger pots if that is an option.
[08:51.400 --> 08:54.000]  If you've got that opportunity, I don't know your situation.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.260]  That is just a suggestion.
[08:55.420 --> 08:56.460]  Start with larger pots.
[08:56.460 --> 08:57.220]  It will help you out.
[08:57.460 --> 08:59.540]  Always go bigger than you think you need to go.
[08:59.700 --> 09:02.340]  These plants are going to grow rapidly outdoors.
[09:02.460 --> 09:03.940]  They're going to drink a lot of water.
[09:04.100 --> 09:05.420]  I would say go with the bigger pot.
[09:05.700 --> 09:07.300]  You're going to use ocean forest soil.
[09:07.300 --> 09:08.260]  That will be acceptable.
[09:08.260 --> 09:09.700]  I may amend it with a few things.
[09:09.980 --> 09:14.220]  Then you say with a handful of red wiggler worms in each pot and then pretty
[09:14.220 --> 09:18.840]  much water only, please suggest nutrients, recharge, et cetera.
[09:19.180 --> 09:19.500]  All right.
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.440]  If you're going to use pots outdoors and you were looking for nutrient
[09:23.440 --> 09:25.760]  suggestions, we have got a couple of options.
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.640]  Would you like to go full organics?
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.360]  Do you want to do amended soils?
[09:29.360 --> 09:32.280]  Do you want to do a super soil type of a thing, or do you want
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.600]  to use bottled nutrients?
[09:33.880 --> 09:35.080]  That is up to you.
[09:35.400 --> 09:38.920]  You need to make that decision long before it is time to put these
[09:38.920 --> 09:40.960]  plants into your outdoor pots.
[09:41.220 --> 09:44.000]  If you're going to make a super soil that needs time to cook.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.280]  If you're going to make a living soil, it may need some time to come alive.
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.180]  If you're going to use bottled nutrients, you just need to buy some things, learn
[09:51.180 --> 09:53.340]  the recipe and start feeding the plants.
[09:53.740 --> 09:55.900]  What you're going to feed them is up to you.
[09:56.500 --> 10:02.220]  If you do choose to feed your plants in organic amended soil, there are a few
[10:02.220 --> 10:03.820]  things you need to make sure you have.
[10:04.100 --> 10:09.140]  You need nitrogen, you need phosphorus, you need potassium, you need some sort
[10:09.140 --> 10:14.460]  of a CalMag or a calcium and magnesium source, you're going to need the 16
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.040]  essential minerals for healthy plant development in that soil because you are
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.040]  not going to add anything but basically water throughout the growth cycle.
[10:23.040 --> 10:24.280]  Seems to be your plan.
[10:24.560 --> 10:27.960]  So if you're going to do that, whip up a really nice batch of
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.820]  soil that has everything you need.
[10:29.820 --> 10:33.200]  You can find a lot of great recipes online for a super soil, or
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.960]  you can go to buildasoil.com.
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.520]  They do not pay me at all.
[10:36.860 --> 10:41.640]  You can go to buildasoil.com and you can get very good soil mixing recipes, and
[10:41.660 --> 10:44.980]  you can also buy all of the amendments right there on that website.
[10:44.980 --> 10:46.100]  It is very convenient.
[10:46.340 --> 10:49.860]  So I would recommend you at least have some sort of a nitrogen source in there,
[10:49.860 --> 10:52.460]  some sort of a phosphorus, a potassium source.
[10:52.460 --> 10:53.620]  You need a calcium source.
[10:53.620 --> 10:54.960]  You need a magnesium source.
[10:55.300 --> 10:59.780]  You're going to need everything a plant needs inside of that soil because you
[10:59.780 --> 11:02.280]  don't plan on giving it any other nutrients.
[11:02.740 --> 11:06.260]  Now, there are many ways of providing those nutrients, those
[11:06.260 --> 11:08.140]  elements through soils.
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.120]  You can use bone meal, blood meal, fish meal, feather meal.
[11:12.200 --> 11:15.480]  There are a bunch of different meals available at your local grow store,
[11:15.720 --> 11:18.760]  your farm supply store, your garden store, your hydro store.
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.080]  We'll have all of those types of products if that is the way you want to go.
[11:22.640 --> 11:25.720]  I would recommend you go back and listen to some of the older episodes with
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.160]  Sean or Jesse and listen to some of their soil building and soil amending
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.720]  ideas and recipes, and that will give you a great start on getting your
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.760]  soil amended for your outdoor grow.
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.540]  And again, the first thing I would do is start with larger pots.
[11:38.540 --> 11:41.940]  That is definitely the first thing that they would probably recommend also.
[11:41.940 --> 11:45.900]  When you listen to those shows, they're going to say probably a 10, a 15, or a
[11:45.900 --> 11:48.060]  20 gallon pot for your outdoor grow.
[11:48.260 --> 11:51.180]  Now, if you want to do bottles, bottles are very easy.
[11:51.420 --> 11:53.180]  Those are effective in an outdoor grow.
[11:53.420 --> 11:56.280]  You mix them up just like you would your indoor grow nutrients.
[11:56.300 --> 11:58.900]  Now, you may not be familiar with an indoor grow mix, so let's
[11:58.900 --> 12:00.100]  talk a little bit about that.
[12:00.420 --> 12:03.420]  I would do some research and find a brand that gets your attention.
[12:03.420 --> 12:04.780]  Something will stand out to you.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.400]  There are a lot of brands available.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.680]  I don't know what you're into.
[12:07.680 --> 12:08.840]  I don't know what your aim is.
[12:08.840 --> 12:10.280]  I don't know if you want to stay organic.
[12:10.280 --> 12:11.920]  I don't know if you want to go full synthetic.
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.640]  I don't know if you want a lot of bottles.
[12:13.640 --> 12:15.320]  I don't know if you want just a couple of bottles.
[12:15.320 --> 12:16.760]  I don't know if you're a mad scientist.
[12:16.780 --> 12:18.640]  I don't know if you just want to keep it simple.
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.640]  I don't know your style or your goal.
[12:21.040 --> 12:22.960]  I would find a brand that gets your attention.
[12:23.220 --> 12:25.560]  I would go to that brand's website, and again, I would find
[12:25.560 --> 12:26.880]  their nutrient calculator.
[12:26.880 --> 12:28.680]  I've talked about this several times on the show.
[12:29.040 --> 12:31.060]  Find that brand's nutrient calculator.
[12:31.300 --> 12:33.160]  It'll ask you which bottles you've purchased.
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.000]  Click on those.
[12:34.380 --> 12:36.060]  Tell it how many weeks you want to flower.
[12:36.060 --> 12:39.220]  You probably want to flower somewhere between eight and nine weeks.
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.580]  So type in eight, nine weeks flower time, and it will make you a detailed recipe.
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.540]  I would feed it very closely to what that recipe recommends, but I would
[12:48.540 --> 12:52.320]  reduce most of those things by probably 25%.
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.260]  So if it says feed it four of something, only give it three.
[12:55.500 --> 12:58.180]  If it says feed it a hundred, only give it 75.
[12:58.940 --> 13:00.260]  You can't unfeed it.
[13:00.540 --> 13:02.620]  If you see it burning, you've given it too much.
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.120]  If you see it hungry, you can give it more, but you can't take away.
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.520]  So start light and increase if you see problems.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.680]  Now, again, when it comes to selecting bottle nutrients, make sure you have got
[13:13.680 --> 13:16.480]  the 16 basic building blocks for plant health.
[13:16.700 --> 13:21.660]  We need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, at least to start
[13:21.660 --> 13:25.300]  with, most of the other things will be included in most of those other bottles
[13:25.440 --> 13:28.620]  and you'll get it all figured out, but be careful that you're including all of
[13:28.620 --> 13:31.040]  the things necessary for healthy plants.
[13:31.700 --> 13:34.500]  You also asked about recharge or et cetera.
[13:34.740 --> 13:39.060]  I would always recommend some recharge or some sort of micro product in my
[13:39.060 --> 13:43.300]  garden, if it's indoors or outdoors, you're doing the red wigglers, those
[13:43.300 --> 13:44.500]  are going to help you out a lot.
[13:44.700 --> 13:48.660]  A little bit of recharge will really give those plants a nice boost.
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.220]  Now, something I would really recommend you pay a lot of attention to, to an
[13:52.220 --> 13:56.460]  outdoor grow is your integrated pest management program.
[13:56.460 --> 14:00.180]  How are you going to keep the bugs away from your precious cannabis plants?
[14:00.180 --> 14:02.600]  We're spending a lot of time thinking about this soil.
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.380]  We are going to feed these plants beautifully.
[14:04.380 --> 14:05.180]  They're going to grow up.
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.920]  They're going to be big, fat, healthy, gorgeous, sexy, potent cannabis plants.
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.320]  Now we need to think about keeping the bugs and the pests away from these plants.
[14:13.580 --> 14:14.600]  What are you going to do?
[14:14.840 --> 14:18.740]  Are you going to do something in the amended soil that promotes a healthy
[14:18.740 --> 14:21.660]  plant that does not want pests, that keeps the pests away?
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.620]  A living organic soil situation can make that possible.
[14:25.620 --> 14:28.220]  If you're not doing that sort of a thing, you are going to need to
[14:28.220 --> 14:29.940]  figure out a better strategy.
[14:30.300 --> 14:31.880]  Are you going to use predator bugs?
[14:31.920 --> 14:34.980]  Are you going to use applied pesticides through sprays?
[14:35.220 --> 14:38.920]  What is your plan from keeping these bugs away from your garden?
[14:39.100 --> 14:42.720]  If you use sprays, please use something that is very gentle and
[14:42.720 --> 14:44.420]  mild to the outdoor environment.
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.160]  Yes, that is your small patch of land, but it is on our earth.
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.240]  So please be very gentle with everything you spray outside.
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.920]  I don't recommend too many sprays in an outdoor situation because that
[14:55.920 --> 14:58.680]  does disrupt the natural ecosystem.
[14:58.900 --> 15:03.020]  But I understand that those plants are precious and sometimes we've got to do
[15:03.020 --> 15:05.980]  what we've got to do to keep specific things away.
[15:06.140 --> 15:09.940]  So be very careful with your integrated pest management system.
[15:10.180 --> 15:14.340]  If you plan to use predator bugs to keep the bad bugs away, do very good
[15:14.340 --> 15:18.540]  research on which bugs will work in your environment and be prepared.
[15:18.840 --> 15:21.900]  Buy the appropriate bug for the appropriate problem.
[15:22.140 --> 15:24.700]  If you live in an area that doesn't get thrips, you don't need to
[15:24.700 --> 15:26.180]  worry about bugs that eat thrips.
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.480]  If you live in an area that is known for getting russet mites or spotted
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.400]  mites, make sure you have predator mites in place in advance before those
[15:35.400 --> 15:38.240]  predator mites or those spotted mites come into play.
[15:38.840 --> 15:40.320]  So I think we've covered the basics.
[15:40.320 --> 15:42.240]  You either need some good bottled nutrients.
[15:42.320 --> 15:45.900]  If you get bottled nutrients, follow the nutrient calculator online.
[15:45.960 --> 15:47.560]  It is usually very simple.
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.440]  If you're not very familiar with bottled nutrients, I recommend you get one
[15:51.440 --> 15:53.280]  brand and buy what you can afford.
[15:53.420 --> 15:57.900]  Make sure you get the base, the micro, the grow, the bloom, and then fill in
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.900]  the gaps from there as you can afford.
[15:59.900 --> 16:02.340]  I would recommend some CalMag and then a Bloom Booster.
[16:02.540 --> 16:04.740]  Of course, I always recommend some sort of microbe.
[16:04.740 --> 16:06.660]  So if you're going to go bottles, that's the way to go.
[16:06.900 --> 16:10.900]  If you're going to go amended soil, you have got endless options.
[16:11.460 --> 16:15.860]  So once you've decided how you want to do your soil inputs, build up a nice
[16:15.860 --> 16:17.700]  soil and pay attention to the plants.
[16:17.900 --> 16:21.820]  You may need to feed a tea-laden flower if the plants become deficient.
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.880]  I would recommend a Bloom Booster tea-laid in flower anyway, so that may be
[16:25.880 --> 16:28.360]  something else you want to read about and learn about.
[16:28.560 --> 16:32.560]  There are talks of that with Sean and Jesse and myself in previous episodes.
[16:32.760 --> 16:35.720]  If you can find those, those would be very beneficial to you.
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.320]  Now, the next thing you need to think about is the integrated pest management.
[16:39.320 --> 16:41.980]  Let's keep the bugs away from these plants.
[16:42.320 --> 16:44.640]  The next thing you may need to think about is keeping the
[16:44.640 --> 16:46.320]  people away from your plants.
[16:46.320 --> 16:49.900]  Once you've got that figured out, you should be on your way to a successful
[16:49.900 --> 16:53.260]  garden. Let's continue with your email because there is more and I've already
[16:53.260 --> 16:54.800]  been talking for quite a while.
[16:55.040 --> 16:55.920]  The message goes on.
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.360]  It says, I'm looking for something relatively simple for a new grower, and
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.080]  I've read that Blue Dream is relatively easy to grow outdoors and is somewhat
[17:04.080 --> 17:06.680]  resistant to powdery mildew and root rot.
[17:07.560 --> 17:13.040]  We've got a saying in our little group here about Blue Dream, and it is kind of
[17:13.040 --> 17:15.240]  a joke, but it is also kind of serious.
[17:15.480 --> 17:19.840]  A lot of people around here have a sticker on their torch or on their rig case, or
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.660]  maybe on their email, and that sticker says, fuck Blue Dream.
[17:24.300 --> 17:27.300]  Mainly because Blue Dream just got worn out.
[17:27.340 --> 17:30.540]  There was a time period where if you wanted to buy weed from a black market
[17:30.540 --> 17:34.380]  dealer, he had Blue Dream and it was ridiculous.
[17:34.380 --> 17:35.100]  It was old.
[17:35.500 --> 17:37.220]  I was tired of the smell of Blue Dream.
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.900]  I was tired of smoking Blue Dream.
[17:39.060 --> 17:42.100]  There are a lot of jokes about Blue Dream being mediocre weed.
[17:42.700 --> 17:46.420]  Honestly, Blue Dream produces quite well in a commercial environment.
[17:46.700 --> 17:49.360]  Blue Dream produces quite well in an outdoor environment.
[17:49.580 --> 17:51.180]  That would work well for you.
[17:51.540 --> 17:55.420]  However, I don't think a lot of people will be interested in smoking Blue Dream
[17:55.460 --> 17:58.180]  because that is a very old, retired strain.
[17:58.740 --> 18:01.660]  If that is what you enjoy, smoke it, enjoy it.
[18:01.980 --> 18:05.020]  But the market has moved far past Blue Dream.
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.740]  So if you're trying to put it on the market, I don't think Blue
[18:07.740 --> 18:09.060]  Dream will do well for you.
[18:09.280 --> 18:12.300]  You may need something a little more modern, a little more popular.
[18:12.580 --> 18:14.080]  Of course, I am a seed breeder.
[18:14.700 --> 18:16.500]  I would recommend something from my line.
[18:16.640 --> 18:19.640]  If you're going to grow outdoors from the Irie Genetics line,
[18:19.640 --> 18:21.160]  I would recommend Morning Dew.
[18:21.160 --> 18:24.080]  Morning Dew is very resistant to mold and mildew.
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.240]  It finishes on time for your outdoor crop and it smells and tastes amazing.
[18:29.240 --> 18:37.140]  The sunshine puts a super funky, foot, skunky, Chem 91 kind of aroma to
[18:37.140 --> 18:38.880]  the Morning Dew when you grow it outdoors.
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.000]  So that is a beautiful plant for the outdoors.
[18:41.240 --> 18:43.200]  Also, I would recommend Prana.
[18:43.240 --> 18:45.640]  Prana is a cross of Flow and Arise.
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.660]  The Flow makes it finish quite early.
[18:47.860 --> 18:51.260]  It keeps it short and squat and really stout plants that
[18:51.260 --> 18:52.500]  are beautiful for outdoors.
[18:52.860 --> 18:55.940]  Another one I would recommend for outside is Sun Kiss.
[18:56.020 --> 18:59.140]  Sun Kiss is a cross of Platinum Tangy and Arise.
[18:59.420 --> 19:02.700]  The Platinum Tangy was made by our friends at Garden of Weeden.
[19:02.740 --> 19:03.940]  Big shout out to those kids.
[19:04.100 --> 19:04.860]  I miss you guys.
[19:05.060 --> 19:06.940]  Can't wait to see you when you come back to Colorado.
[19:06.940 --> 19:10.360]  But the Platinum Tangy to Arise makes beautiful plants.
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.860]  They stay fairly short, fairly squat, and they are very robust.
[19:14.880 --> 19:18.160]  They've got really strong branches, really beefy stalks.
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.080]  It really stands up to the outdoor wind.
[19:20.440 --> 19:23.720]  It's known for not getting powdery mildew or any sort of molds.
[19:23.920 --> 19:26.040]  Also, it finishes quite early.
[19:26.040 --> 19:28.240]  It is probably my earliest finishing strain.
[19:28.400 --> 19:30.920]  So the Sun Kiss is another great one for outdoors.
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.920]  So out of my line, again, I would recommend Morning Dew, Prana, or
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.560]  Sun Kiss for some outdoor growth in your area.
[19:38.860 --> 19:39.720]  The message goes on.
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.320]  It says, but then again, what the fuck do I know?
[19:42.320 --> 19:45.500]  Hey, you know a lot because you've been listening to a great podcast that has
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.380]  been keeping you educated and up to speed.
[19:47.380 --> 19:49.260]  So please don't ever doubt yourself.
[19:49.660 --> 19:50.540]  You continue the message.
[19:50.540 --> 19:53.860]  You say any insight and feedback is greatly appreciated.
[19:54.060 --> 19:56.980]  I had a blast growing last year and I am looking forward to getting a
[19:56.980 --> 19:59.180]  little bit better this year.
[19:59.420 --> 20:02.240]  Hey, you've got the right attitude and you're asking the right questions.
[20:02.260 --> 20:05.620]  So I bet you this year will be a little bit better.
[20:05.900 --> 20:07.780]  He ends the message by saying, thanks, man.
[20:07.780 --> 20:09.820]  I look forward to any and all suggestion.
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.080]  Thanks, buddy.
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.660]  And signed his name and gave his phone number.
[20:13.660 --> 20:15.020]  Those are, no, I'm just kidding.
[20:15.020 --> 20:16.180]  I'm not going to read that on the show.
[20:16.500 --> 20:18.100]  Hey, I do appreciate this email.
[20:18.140 --> 20:20.700]  I see your name quite often in my messages.
[20:20.700 --> 20:23.620]  I see you on my social media and I see you on Patreon.
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.460]  So big thank you for all of that support.
[20:25.740 --> 20:26.780]  Thanks for the great email.
[20:26.940 --> 20:28.380]  I hope I answered your question.
[20:28.620 --> 20:32.260]  If you have any followup questions, please send me another message.
[20:32.540 --> 20:35.580]  If anybody else out there has any cannabis related questions, if you've
[20:35.580 --> 20:39.180]  got a grow question, a cannabis culture question, please ask.
