[00:01.530 --> 00:04.690]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:04.690 --> 00:05.930]  It's time for another episode
[00:05.930 --> 00:07.690]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:07.690 --> 00:11.330]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:11.330 --> 00:12.690]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:12.690 --> 00:14.050]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.050 --> 00:16.370]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:16.370 --> 00:17.690]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:17.690 --> 00:19.170]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:19.170 --> 00:20.930]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:20.930 --> 00:23.690]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.690 --> 00:25.650]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.650 --> 00:28.530]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:28.530 --> 00:30.350]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you
[00:30.350 --> 00:32.550]  by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:32.550 --> 00:34.310]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[00:34.310 --> 00:36.910]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:36.910 --> 00:40.270]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.270 --> 00:42.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
[00:42.730 --> 00:45.310]  pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig
[00:45.310 --> 00:46.870]  because it's time for another episode
[00:46.870 --> 00:48.670]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:54.190 --> 00:55.370]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:55.370 --> 00:56.870]  It's time for episode 300.
[00:56.870 --> 00:58.310]  Welcome to the show.
[00:58.310 --> 00:59.470]  What's up, dude?
[00:59.510 --> 01:00.550]  What's up, guys?
[01:00.550 --> 01:02.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, join me on the podcast.
[01:02.470 --> 01:04.230]  Awkwardly and high as fuck.
[01:04.230 --> 01:05.550]  Oh my God.
[01:05.550 --> 01:06.390]  Welcome to the show.
[01:06.390 --> 01:07.270]  We got Kevin right in front of me.
[01:07.270 --> 01:08.110]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:08.110 --> 01:08.930]  Sweet, what's up, man?
[01:08.930 --> 01:09.770]  Thanks for having me.
[01:09.770 --> 01:10.610]  You haven't been here in a while, man.
[01:10.610 --> 01:11.430]  Thanks for coming back.
[01:11.430 --> 01:12.590]  It's been a little bit.
[01:12.590 --> 01:13.430]  It's been a little bit.
[01:13.430 --> 01:14.250]  A month or two.
[01:14.250 --> 01:15.090]  Well, thanks for coming, bro.
[01:15.090 --> 01:15.930]  It's good to have you.
[01:15.930 --> 01:16.750]  Thanks for having me.
[01:16.750 --> 01:17.590]  Thanks for dabbing with me.
[01:17.590 --> 01:18.430]  Brought a sweet new rig.
[01:18.430 --> 01:19.250]  For sure.
[01:19.250 --> 01:20.090]  Brought some great turps.
[01:20.090 --> 01:20.930]  Yeah.
[01:20.930 --> 01:21.750]  Made a hell of an entrance.
[01:21.750 --> 01:22.590]  Indeed.
[01:22.590 --> 01:23.430]  Thank you, brother.
[01:23.430 --> 01:24.270]  Also, to my left, a regular visitor,
[01:24.270 --> 01:25.990]  a repeat offender, I like to say.
[01:25.990 --> 01:26.830]  Cracker Mike is here.
[01:26.830 --> 01:27.650]  Welcome to the show, white Mike.
[01:27.650 --> 01:29.110]  What's up, everybody?
[01:29.110 --> 01:31.030]  Guys, 300 episodes, dude.
[01:31.030 --> 01:31.870]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:31.870 --> 01:33.590]  I haven't been this excited for a podcast
[01:33.590 --> 01:34.550]  in a long time.
[01:34.550 --> 01:35.750]  Yeah.
[01:35.750 --> 01:37.130]  Welcome to the show, guys.
[01:37.990 --> 01:40.550]  We got a couple things I wanted to highlight.
[01:40.550 --> 01:43.590]  300 episodes and four years.
[01:43.590 --> 01:45.430]  I think right around the date that this show comes out
[01:45.430 --> 01:47.270]  will be four years of podcasting also.
[01:47.270 --> 01:48.790]  That's lined up pretty well.
[01:48.790 --> 01:53.790]  Then also, in February, we had 10,000 downloads on Stitcher.
[01:54.070 --> 01:54.910]  That's awesome.
[01:54.910 --> 01:56.230]  Lots of landmarks going on.
[01:56.230 --> 01:57.950]  That's super cool.
[01:57.950 --> 01:59.550]  100, sorry, I wrote down 10.
[01:59.550 --> 02:00.710]  I gotta add more zeros.
[02:00.710 --> 02:01.550]  I was gonna say.
[02:01.550 --> 02:04.110]  100, fuck, we're high as giraffe pussy over here, aren't we?
[02:04.110 --> 02:06.150]  You forgot a whole zero, bro?
[02:06.150 --> 02:07.710]  Yeah, bro, I only wrote down 10,000.
[02:07.710 --> 02:09.270]  You didn't say 90% of the number.
[02:09.270 --> 02:10.470]  Is that a zero or a comma?
[02:10.470 --> 02:11.310]  Here, we'll just change it.
[02:11.310 --> 02:12.390]  There you go, 100,000.
[02:12.390 --> 02:13.230]  There we go.
[02:13.230 --> 02:17.270]  You guys, in February, we got 100,000 downloads on Stitcher.
[02:17.270 --> 02:18.110]  There we go.
[02:18.110 --> 02:19.910]  Cue the celebration sounds, yeah.
[02:19.910 --> 02:20.910]  Sorry, folks.
[02:20.910 --> 02:21.950]  Right before we hit record,
[02:21.950 --> 02:23.550]  I suggest that we all take another dab,
[02:24.310 --> 02:25.150]  and that might have been unnecessary.
[02:25.150 --> 02:27.310]  Yeah, I wanted to hit one more bullet point,
[02:27.310 --> 02:29.230]  and then we'll talk about what we were smoking on,
[02:29.230 --> 02:30.070]  because I always start the show
[02:30.070 --> 02:31.350]  talking about what we were smoking on.
[02:31.350 --> 02:33.950]  But we got one more thing we gotta celebrate.
[02:33.950 --> 02:36.910]  Kevin, today on the day that we're recording,
[02:36.910 --> 02:39.310]  is 20 months alcohol free.
[02:39.310 --> 02:40.670]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:40.670 --> 02:42.030]  I said 20 months, right?
[02:42.030 --> 02:42.870]  Yes.
[02:42.870 --> 02:43.710]  Okay, that's accurate,
[02:43.710 --> 02:46.270]  because I've been fucking up the start of the show already.
[02:46.270 --> 02:47.110]  20 months.
[02:47.110 --> 02:48.750]  Dude, congratulations, brother.
[02:48.750 --> 02:50.870]  I'm proud of you, and that means a lot to me.
[02:50.870 --> 02:51.710]  I know it means a lot to you,
[02:51.710 --> 02:53.510]  but it means a lot to me that you did that.
[02:53.510 --> 02:54.350]  Right on, yeah.
[02:54.350 --> 02:55.990]  Yeah, it was just a decision I made,
[02:55.990 --> 02:57.430]  and fortunately enough,
[02:57.430 --> 03:00.590]  I was able to just make it and do it.
[03:00.590 --> 03:03.710]  I still hung out with all the same friends.
[03:03.710 --> 03:07.310]  I still went to local shows at bars and things.
[03:07.310 --> 03:08.590]  I didn't really shy away.
[03:08.590 --> 03:11.350]  I was on a pool league, so that was all at bars.
[03:11.350 --> 03:12.750]  Wow.
[03:12.750 --> 03:14.510]  You know, I've had free drinks offered to me
[03:14.510 --> 03:15.910]  by close friends and whatnot,
[03:15.910 --> 03:17.430]  and it's just something I don't want.
[03:17.430 --> 03:19.750]  It's almost like tobacco or cigarettes or something.
[03:19.750 --> 03:21.710]  It's just something that's not appealing
[03:21.710 --> 03:24.270]  and something I just don't care for and don't want anymore.
[03:24.270 --> 03:25.110]  Good job.
[03:25.110 --> 03:26.470]  And I was able to make a bunch of
[03:26.470 --> 03:28.590]  even more positive changes in my life,
[03:28.590 --> 03:30.310]  so it's awesome.
[03:30.310 --> 03:33.230]  I was able to get my own car, my own place to live,
[03:33.230 --> 03:34.870]  have a pretty stable life now,
[03:34.870 --> 03:37.310]  which is much better than it was.
[03:37.310 --> 03:39.310]  I was ruining all the relationships that I had,
[03:39.310 --> 03:42.550]  so coming completely around
[03:42.550 --> 03:44.670]  and being able to earn most of those back,
[03:44.670 --> 03:47.150]  even with the people that I hurt the most
[03:47.150 --> 03:48.870]  and was the closest with,
[03:48.870 --> 03:51.230]  is something that I'm really grateful for
[03:51.230 --> 03:52.150]  and I'm proud of,
[03:52.150 --> 03:54.870]  and I'm just gonna keep going on the same road
[03:54.870 --> 03:57.430]  and keep building and continue life.
[03:57.430 --> 03:58.590]  Well, now you're on a podcast.
[03:58.590 --> 04:00.110]  They got 100,000 listens,
[04:00.110 --> 04:01.790]  so now you got some accountability, bro.
[04:01.790 --> 04:02.630]  That's cool.
[04:02.630 --> 04:03.470]  100,000 people are rooting for you.
[04:03.470 --> 04:04.630]  I don't need accountability.
[04:04.630 --> 04:05.470]  I got my own.
[04:05.470 --> 04:06.510]  Yeah, that's the attitude.
[04:06.510 --> 04:07.350]  That's what I like.
[04:07.350 --> 04:08.190]  I'm good on that.
[04:08.190 --> 04:09.030]  That's what I like.
[04:09.030 --> 04:10.870]  I'm not gonna try to steal your thunder,
[04:10.870 --> 04:12.230]  but I quit drinking a long time ago also,
[04:12.230 --> 04:15.390]  and that point when it doesn't even become a thing,
[04:15.390 --> 04:16.310]  that feels so good.
[04:16.310 --> 04:17.150]  It does.
[04:17.150 --> 04:18.070]  When someone's like, you want a beer,
[04:18.110 --> 04:19.910]  and you're like, no, I'm good.
[04:19.910 --> 04:20.750]  I don't want a beer,
[04:20.750 --> 04:22.230]  because for a long time, they'd say, do you want a beer?
[04:22.230 --> 04:23.750]  And I'd say, fucking yes.
[04:23.750 --> 04:25.310]  I want seven.
[04:25.310 --> 04:27.390]  I want them cold, frosty.
[04:27.390 --> 04:28.270]  I want dark beer.
[04:28.270 --> 04:29.190]  I want them in my hand,
[04:29.190 --> 04:30.150]  and then I want them in my mouth,
[04:30.150 --> 04:31.350]  and then just hand me another one.
[04:31.350 --> 04:32.310]  That's how it used to be.
[04:32.310 --> 04:33.150]  Absolutely.
[04:33.150 --> 04:33.990]  And when that feeling goes away,
[04:33.990 --> 04:35.830]  it's just like, ah, it's kind of release.
[04:35.830 --> 04:36.990]  You're like, ah.
[04:36.990 --> 04:38.430]  You don't have that pressure on your body,
[04:38.430 --> 04:39.790]  your mind, your brain.
[04:39.790 --> 04:41.910]  It kind of drives you crazy just wanting something.
[04:41.910 --> 04:43.190]  It's one less thing to desire.
[04:43.190 --> 04:44.070]  Congratulations, brother.
[04:44.070 --> 04:45.270]  Good job.
[04:45.270 --> 04:46.110]  Thanks, man.
[04:46.110 --> 04:46.950]  You got my respect.
[04:46.950 --> 04:47.790]  Welcome back.
[04:48.510 --> 04:49.350]  Appreciate it.
[04:49.350 --> 04:50.910]  You never went away.
[04:50.910 --> 04:52.310]  Just sometimes we gotta.
[04:52.310 --> 04:53.510]  Yeah, go through our own things.
[04:53.510 --> 04:54.350]  Yes, yes.
[04:54.350 --> 04:55.950]  Unfortunately, I went through some negative things,
[04:55.950 --> 04:58.670]  and I've made amends with all the people
[04:58.670 --> 04:59.630]  I can make amends with,
[04:59.630 --> 05:00.710]  and that's all I can do,
[05:00.710 --> 05:02.030]  and I'm just gonna keep forward
[05:02.030 --> 05:03.710]  with the positivity from here.
[05:03.710 --> 05:04.550]  Hell yeah.
[05:04.550 --> 05:05.390]  Appreciate it.
[05:05.390 --> 05:06.230]  Do you want people to follow you
[05:06.230 --> 05:07.230]  on any sort of social media?
[05:07.230 --> 05:09.150]  I'm only on Instagram right now.
[05:09.150 --> 05:13.430]  It's at elevated concentrations, all one word.
[05:13.430 --> 05:14.270]  Pretty simple.
[05:14.270 --> 05:15.310]  So if you wanna come check it out,
[05:15.310 --> 05:17.150]  I got drum pictures, and ash pictures,
[05:17.590 --> 05:18.430]  and positive pictures,
[05:18.430 --> 05:20.030]  and just cool stuff that I post every now and then.
[05:20.030 --> 05:21.430]  I don't overblow nothing up,
[05:21.430 --> 05:23.030]  but I got some cool stuff.
[05:23.030 --> 05:23.870]  What are you trying to say, bro?
[05:23.870 --> 05:24.870]  You saying I overblow shit?
[05:24.870 --> 05:26.110]  No, no, no, no, no.
[05:26.110 --> 05:27.990]  I just, I don't have a lot of,
[05:27.990 --> 05:29.190]  I don't share every day,
[05:29.190 --> 05:30.590]  so it's not a lot of content,
[05:30.590 --> 05:31.590]  but it's cool content,
[05:31.590 --> 05:33.190]  and it's always positive stuff.
[05:33.190 --> 05:34.230]  Yeah, check out my boy, Kev.
[05:34.230 --> 05:35.630]  Check out elevated concentrations.
[05:35.630 --> 05:36.710]  Check out his hash pictures.
[05:36.710 --> 05:39.750]  I always share love with the community,
[05:39.750 --> 05:42.110]  so I love local stuff.
[05:42.110 --> 05:44.630]  Kev's been a part of the Colorado hash community
[05:44.630 --> 05:45.470]  since the beginning.
[05:45.470 --> 05:46.310]  We've been.
[05:46.470 --> 05:48.470]  Yeah, art, music, cannabis.
[05:48.470 --> 05:49.430]  There you go. About all of it.
[05:49.430 --> 05:50.270]  Yeah.
[05:50.270 --> 05:51.110]  Spread the love.
[05:51.110 --> 05:53.830]  Yeah, we used to go hang out at the RINO district.
[05:53.830 --> 05:55.590]  We used to go hang out at Adam Dunn's place.
[05:55.590 --> 05:56.870]  We used to go to the events together.
[05:56.870 --> 05:58.870]  I used to take Kev with me all over the place.
[05:58.870 --> 06:00.950]  Met some cool people, so.
[06:00.950 --> 06:02.150]  All right, Cracker Mike.
[06:02.150 --> 06:03.870]  Since I let Kev plug his stuff,
[06:03.870 --> 06:05.830]  how can all these people find you on social media
[06:05.830 --> 06:06.670]  so they can stalk you and troll you?
[06:06.670 --> 06:08.030]  If you wanna follow me,
[06:08.030 --> 06:09.950]  the two places to do that best
[06:09.950 --> 06:13.270]  are Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook,
[06:13.270 --> 06:15.830]  or Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[06:16.270 --> 06:18.070]  You guys, he tweets a lot of good stuff.
[06:18.070 --> 06:19.350]  He retweets a lot of good stuff.
[06:19.350 --> 06:20.190]  Follow him there.
[06:20.190 --> 06:21.030]  It's mostly been retweets lately.
[06:21.030 --> 06:23.390]  Yeah, but make sure you check out
[06:23.390 --> 06:24.830]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws,
[06:24.830 --> 06:25.670]  because. Yes, yes, yes.
[06:25.670 --> 06:27.150]  That's where all the wonder happens.
[06:27.150 --> 06:30.630]  Their opposition is growing.
[06:30.630 --> 06:32.270]  Oh, they're getting bad shit, you guys.
[06:32.270 --> 06:33.110]  It's fun lately.
[06:33.110 --> 06:33.950]  Come follow me.
[06:33.950 --> 06:35.510]  Yeah, support Mike.
[06:35.510 --> 06:37.710]  Just don't, when you find out,
[06:37.710 --> 06:39.430]  when you realize who his opposition is,
[06:39.430 --> 06:41.110]  it's another Facebook group,
[06:41.110 --> 06:42.230]  and they are.
[06:42.230 --> 06:43.990]  Several dozen now.
[06:44.030 --> 06:45.590]  Several dozen now.
[06:45.590 --> 06:47.790]  But they're not educated in cannabis,
[06:47.790 --> 06:50.070]  and please don't approach them.
[06:50.070 --> 06:51.190]  I'm trying to be nice, Mike.
[06:51.190 --> 06:52.030]  I'm trying to be nice.
[06:52.030 --> 06:54.830]  I'm not trying to release the iry army on these people.
[06:54.830 --> 06:56.670]  I can't believe gravity hasn't gotten most of these bitches.
[06:56.670 --> 06:57.710]  Be polite to them,
[06:57.710 --> 06:59.110]  and speak factually.
[06:59.110 --> 07:00.070]  Don't call them names.
[07:00.070 --> 07:01.390]  Don't stoop to their level.
[07:01.390 --> 07:02.390]  Play like an adult.
[07:02.390 --> 07:03.230]  Inform them.
[07:03.230 --> 07:04.070]  Educate them.
[07:04.070 --> 07:04.910]  Don't speak emotionally.
[07:04.910 --> 07:06.510]  Speak with facts and knowledge,
[07:06.510 --> 07:09.750]  and just come at them with respect
[07:09.750 --> 07:12.110]  and care for the cannabis
[07:12.110 --> 07:13.870]  and the knowledge you're trying to spread.
[07:14.710 --> 07:15.550]  Yeah, you represent myself.
[07:15.550 --> 07:16.390]  You represent Mike.
[07:16.390 --> 07:17.230]  You represent Kevin.
[07:17.230 --> 07:18.070]  You represent every cannabis plant.
[07:18.070 --> 07:20.070]  Right, represent the industry and the plant.
[07:20.070 --> 07:21.390]  Exactly, the patients.
[07:21.390 --> 07:22.230]  Represent.
[07:22.230 --> 07:23.750]  One of the things about our community
[07:23.750 --> 07:25.630]  that I always kind of shake my head at
[07:25.630 --> 07:27.710]  is we do not always represent ourselves well.
[07:27.710 --> 07:28.550]  Nope.
[07:28.550 --> 07:30.030]  Yeah, a lot of people kind of,
[07:30.030 --> 07:30.870]  they show me hatred
[07:30.870 --> 07:33.030]  because I'm a dreadlocked white guy doing a cannabis show.
[07:33.030 --> 07:33.870]  And they're like,
[07:33.870 --> 07:34.750]  yeah, you're everything we're against.
[07:34.750 --> 07:35.750]  And I'm like, I'm well-spoken.
[07:35.750 --> 07:36.630]  I know what I'm talking about,
[07:36.630 --> 07:37.990]  so I'm going to do my thing.
[07:37.990 --> 07:39.310]  There's ways to disagree
[07:39.310 --> 07:42.030]  and have a conversation without it being an argument.
[07:42.030 --> 07:42.870]  Yes.
[07:42.870 --> 07:43.710]  So please do that.
[07:44.550 --> 07:47.510]  And also interact with Mike's Facebook rivalry there.
[07:47.510 --> 07:48.790]  So I said earlier that we're going to talk
[07:48.790 --> 07:49.790]  about what we're smoking on,
[07:49.790 --> 07:51.230]  but apparently we smoke so much of it
[07:51.230 --> 07:53.990]  that we don't know what the fuck is going on anymore.
[07:53.990 --> 07:55.630]  We started off, where did we start off?
[07:55.630 --> 07:56.990]  We started off with some,
[07:56.990 --> 07:59.190]  Kev, tell me about the rockin' extracts
[07:59.190 --> 08:00.030]  you were passing me.
[08:00.030 --> 08:02.110]  Okay, so I got some rockin' extracts.
[08:02.110 --> 08:03.590]  Just gonna check the jar.
[08:03.590 --> 08:04.870]  Rockstar Kush.
[08:04.870 --> 08:06.750]  That Rockstar Kush is what we started with,
[08:06.750 --> 08:08.070]  and it gave me a nice eye-high.
[08:08.070 --> 08:10.110]  It made me nice and chilled out.
[08:10.110 --> 08:12.230]  It's got a little bit of a CBD level in it,
[08:12.230 --> 08:15.870]  so it's kinda got something going for it.
[08:15.870 --> 08:17.310]  It's pretty nice after a long day.
[08:17.310 --> 08:20.110]  And then next was some sour strawberry
[08:20.110 --> 08:22.950]  from Garden of Whedon, which is quite delicious.
[08:22.950 --> 08:25.150]  Much love and respect to everybody at the Garden of Whedon.
[08:25.150 --> 08:26.190]  It's always good.
[08:26.190 --> 08:28.390]  Good friends, good family, good people.
[08:28.390 --> 08:29.230]  Absolutely.
[08:29.230 --> 08:30.310]  Amazing extract artists.
[08:30.310 --> 08:31.150]  Indeed.
[08:31.150 --> 08:32.270]  Great photographers.
[08:32.270 --> 08:34.790]  Huge members of the community that we need,
[08:34.790 --> 08:37.230]  that we love and respect and support all the way through.
[08:37.230 --> 08:38.070]  So much love to those guys.
[08:38.070 --> 08:39.870]  I'm not too sure on the label or anything
[08:39.870 --> 08:41.710]  where the flower came from exactly,
[08:42.150 --> 08:43.990]  but whoever grew it was fantastic.
[08:43.990 --> 08:47.750]  So this most recent batch of Garden of Whedon sour strawberry,
[08:47.750 --> 08:50.670]  whoever grew that material was awesome, spot on.
[08:50.670 --> 08:51.510]  Nice work, folks.
[08:51.510 --> 08:53.110]  And the extract was fantastic as well.
[08:53.110 --> 08:54.430]  Big up, Garden of Whedon.
[08:54.430 --> 08:56.070]  Shout out, Garden of Whedon once again.
[08:56.070 --> 08:56.910]  Miss you kids.
[08:56.910 --> 08:57.910]  Let's hang out more frequently.
[08:57.910 --> 09:00.310]  I go see them occasionally, not often enough.
[09:00.310 --> 09:02.910]  So then we shifted into,
[09:02.910 --> 09:05.110]  Mike brought some sour diesel live resin
[09:05.110 --> 09:07.710]  from CSC, Concentrate Supply Company.
[09:07.710 --> 09:09.350]  It's just straight fuel.
[09:09.350 --> 09:10.190]  Yes, it is.
[09:10.510 --> 09:12.830]  And Kev goes, that's gasoline.
[09:12.830 --> 09:14.430]  He just said it like, I don't know,
[09:14.430 --> 09:15.710]  like a kid licking a window.
[09:15.710 --> 09:16.550]  That's gasoline.
[09:17.470 --> 09:18.470]  He's just like, yes, Kevin,
[09:18.470 --> 09:20.510]  that's all you can smell right now is gasoline.
[09:20.510 --> 09:21.350]  Good job.
[09:22.510 --> 09:23.390]  I didn't dab one of those.
[09:23.390 --> 09:24.630]  No, I just didn't grab one of those.
[09:24.630 --> 09:25.470]  I could have.
[09:25.470 --> 09:28.110]  I chose to smoke some Skywalker batter.
[09:28.110 --> 09:29.710]  And I've been talking about the Skywalker batter
[09:29.710 --> 09:31.590]  for a minute, so everybody knows what that's like.
[09:31.590 --> 09:32.870]  Then we upped our game.
[09:34.230 --> 09:36.910]  That's when everybody went full R-tard.
[09:36.950 --> 09:41.230]  We grabbed some of these Clementine,
[09:41.230 --> 09:43.670]  high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract crystals
[09:43.670 --> 09:46.750]  that are, they're calling it the diamonds.
[09:46.750 --> 09:48.710]  There were two, maybe three,
[09:48.710 --> 09:51.310]  two in a tiny piece in here that were the gram.
[09:51.310 --> 09:55.070]  So it's high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract chunks.
[09:55.070 --> 09:57.990]  There are two half gram chunks in this container.
[09:57.990 --> 10:02.990]  We took medium sized dabs and coughed our faces off
[10:03.310 --> 10:05.190]  and then giggled for about 10 minutes.
[10:05.190 --> 10:06.310]  And then we had to take a little break
[10:06.710 --> 10:07.790]  and then we decided to record.
[10:07.790 --> 10:10.510]  And it feels like we may have taken too short of a break.
[10:10.510 --> 10:13.350]  Last time we ended up giggle high, yo.
[10:13.350 --> 10:14.190]  It's been a minute.
[10:14.190 --> 10:16.390]  It's been a long minute.
[10:16.390 --> 10:18.510]  Mission fucking accomplished.
[10:18.510 --> 10:21.150]  I've got that like weird, my face feels strange high.
[10:21.150 --> 10:23.870]  I'm like looking around the room, like, is this where we are?
[10:23.870 --> 10:25.270]  And it is, it is where we are.
[10:25.270 --> 10:26.910]  Then after that, I thought I'd get stupid.
[10:26.910 --> 10:29.230]  I've got some Gorilla Glue.
[10:29.230 --> 10:30.950]  They're calling this the Ambrosia.
[10:30.950 --> 10:32.990]  It's got some big crystals in there.
[10:32.990 --> 10:35.730]  Some big THC crystals and a lot of turpy sauce.
[10:36.170 --> 10:37.810]  I took a nice size dab of this.
[10:37.810 --> 10:39.610]  These guys made fun of me because when I dabbed it,
[10:39.610 --> 10:41.170]  my face turned different colors.
[10:41.170 --> 10:42.810]  Mike's looking at the concentrates right now.
[10:42.810 --> 10:43.650]  Good Lord.
[10:43.650 --> 10:44.470]  Yeah, right?
[10:44.470 --> 10:46.250]  It's little diamonds and some sauce, right?
[10:46.250 --> 10:47.530]  Yeah.
[10:47.530 --> 10:49.170]  Like, geez.
[10:49.170 --> 10:50.970]  How much came in that container originally?
[10:50.970 --> 10:51.810]  That's a gram.
[10:51.810 --> 10:53.410]  I just took one tiny dab out of that.
[10:53.410 --> 10:54.250]  That's just a gram.
[10:54.250 --> 10:55.570]  Oh, it looks like three from here.
[10:55.570 --> 10:56.810]  Oh, no, to me, I'm like, damn it.
[10:56.810 --> 10:59.450]  I wish there was way more in that container.
[10:59.450 --> 11:01.610]  It's just the container and the angle, but that was crazy.
[11:01.610 --> 11:04.090]  Yeah, that's Gorilla Glue number four.
[11:04.090 --> 11:07.250]  That's because one diamond is one dab.
[11:07.250 --> 11:08.370]  So you only get three dabs.
[11:08.370 --> 11:09.730]  That was something I was gonna segue
[11:09.730 --> 11:11.650]  into your good work, Kevin.
[11:11.650 --> 11:14.190]  Kevin brought up the theory that it's like nachos.
[11:14.190 --> 11:16.630]  I'm calling it the nacho theory.
[11:16.630 --> 11:18.850]  If it's stuck together, it's one dab.
[11:18.850 --> 11:22.570]  Dude, you just took a minuscule dab of this
[11:22.570 --> 11:25.370]  Clementine High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract
[11:25.370 --> 11:27.730]  diamond crystal.
[11:27.730 --> 11:29.890]  Imagine what would happen to you if you dabbed that thing.
[11:29.890 --> 11:30.730]  I know.
[11:30.730 --> 11:33.370]  That's .7, and that one right there is probably .2.
[11:34.290 --> 11:36.010]  I'm gonna say that's .6.
[11:36.010 --> 11:36.890]  I don't know.
[11:36.890 --> 11:37.810]  I'm just guessing.
[11:37.810 --> 11:39.170]  It's probably .6 of a gram.
[11:39.170 --> 11:41.770]  I'd say .6 and .3 or .6 and .4-ish.
[11:41.770 --> 11:43.810]  I would cough till next year.
[11:43.810 --> 11:46.250]  Mike, you're gonna cough just looking at it.
[11:46.250 --> 11:47.930]  Seriously, it's tickling my throat.
[11:47.930 --> 11:49.530]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[11:49.530 --> 11:50.450]  You'd be so lit.
[11:50.450 --> 11:51.330]  That's impressive.
[11:51.330 --> 11:52.170]  I'm down with your nacho theory.
[11:52.170 --> 11:54.690]  To me, that sounds like the theory
[11:54.690 --> 11:56.690]  of the dude who sells the diamonds.
[11:56.690 --> 11:57.530]  Yeah.
[11:57.530 --> 11:59.610]  I don't remember whose page I read that on,
[11:59.610 --> 12:02.330]  but I read it on somebody's Instagram page.
[12:02.330 --> 12:03.170]  Was the profile not apothecary?
[12:03.170 --> 12:05.530]  It did not come up with that idea.
[12:05.530 --> 12:06.770]  No, it was not.
[12:06.770 --> 12:08.250]  It's like nachos.
[12:08.250 --> 12:09.330]  So you guys, it's like nachos.
[12:09.330 --> 12:10.810]  No, because then someone's gonna come to your house
[12:10.810 --> 12:11.890]  and just dab all your shatter.
[12:11.890 --> 12:12.730]  They're just gonna squish.
[12:12.730 --> 12:13.570]  I remember.
[12:13.570 --> 12:14.410]  It's like nachos, bro.
[12:14.410 --> 12:16.050]  This is like the edible episode where you were like,
[12:16.050 --> 12:19.250]  this is what I eat, and I was like, don't tell people that.
[12:19.250 --> 12:21.810]  Like, because somebody on vacation's gonna be like,
[12:21.810 --> 12:25.130]  Ross to Jeff said this, so we figured we'll split it.
[12:26.210 --> 12:27.490]  Don't eat edibles or dab like me
[12:27.490 --> 12:28.690]  unless you're experienced, you guys.
[12:28.690 --> 12:31.050]  That will lead to disaster and naps.
[12:31.090 --> 12:33.450]  I'm gonna have to add a disclaimer to the front of the show.
[12:33.450 --> 12:35.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not professionals,
[12:35.050 --> 12:37.250]  but we do play some on podcasts.
[12:37.250 --> 12:38.410]  No, we're professionals.
[12:38.410 --> 12:39.490]  Pros get paid.
[12:41.450 --> 12:43.050]  That's where that line gets drawn.
[12:43.050 --> 12:43.890]  All right, then.
[12:43.890 --> 12:44.730]  Yeah.
[12:44.730 --> 12:45.550]  All right.
[12:45.550 --> 12:47.250]  Speaking of getting paid, that's a good one.
[12:47.250 --> 12:48.090]  I'm to be professional.
[12:48.090 --> 12:50.890]  You guys are setting up segways like champions for me
[12:50.890 --> 12:52.250]  at the start of this episode, which is good,
[12:52.250 --> 12:53.090]  because we're gonna take dabs
[12:53.090 --> 12:55.690]  and just start getting to the fun part of this show.
[12:57.610 --> 12:59.050]  If you watch the YouTube videos,
[12:59.050 --> 13:00.450]  and don't forget to watch the YouTube videos,
[13:00.810 --> 13:02.890]  you guys can grow from your heart podcast YouTube channel.
[13:02.890 --> 13:05.450]  There are 200 YouTube videos up now,
[13:05.450 --> 13:07.670]  which means that there are 100 episodes in the feed.
[13:07.670 --> 13:10.290]  You've got 201 through 300 in the feed,
[13:10.290 --> 13:12.410]  and then you've got one through 200 on YouTube.
[13:12.410 --> 13:14.690]  You can listen to all the podcast episodes right now,
[13:14.690 --> 13:16.130]  which is pretty cool, I think.
[13:16.130 --> 13:17.410]  I'm kind of caught up for a minute.
[13:17.410 --> 13:18.730]  I still need to make more videos,
[13:18.730 --> 13:20.910]  but here's what I'm getting at.
[13:20.910 --> 13:24.650]  All the old episodes have other people's music in it,
[13:24.650 --> 13:27.370]  and YouTube hates me for that.
[13:27.370 --> 13:28.570]  Every time I post a new video,
[13:28.570 --> 13:31.450]  it's like copyright claim, copyright violation,
[13:31.450 --> 13:32.650]  and they're not doing anything to me.
[13:32.650 --> 13:34.650]  They're just saying I can't monetize the page,
[13:34.650 --> 13:37.010]  and they limit things and advertising for me.
[13:37.010 --> 13:40.150]  They don't put me in other people's up and coming videos.
[13:40.150 --> 13:41.250]  I don't get as much play,
[13:41.250 --> 13:44.090]  because I'm using other people's copyrighted shit.
[13:44.090 --> 13:45.890]  If you noticed at the start of the show,
[13:45.890 --> 13:47.150]  I played a brand new track
[13:47.150 --> 13:50.250]  that was produced by Rasta Jeff with GarageBand.
[13:50.250 --> 13:52.330]  You'll hear some new music coming up.
[13:52.330 --> 13:53.450]  That's why there's different music.
[13:53.450 --> 13:56.250]  I'm trying to not piss off YouTube so much.
[13:56.250 --> 13:59.170]  Starting with episode 300, there will be new music.
[13:59.170 --> 14:01.790]  It'll be, I'll probably have to stop using
[14:01.790 --> 14:02.890]  other people's music,
[14:02.890 --> 14:06.970]  unless you've got music that you have produced,
[14:06.970 --> 14:08.650]  and you would like to hear on the podcast,
[14:08.650 --> 14:11.330]  and you can give me full permission to use.
[14:11.330 --> 14:13.330]  When I put it up on YouTube, and they flag me and say,
[14:13.330 --> 14:15.250]  hey, you can't do this, it's gonna piss me off,
[14:15.250 --> 14:16.450]  so don't put some music up there
[14:16.450 --> 14:20.330]  that you can't give me full copyright and permission to use.
[14:20.330 --> 14:22.010]  So if you've published it on iTunes or YouTube,
[14:22.010 --> 14:23.350]  I probably can't do it.
[14:23.350 --> 14:26.210]  If you would like to make me a track or make me some music,
[14:27.050 --> 14:28.250]  I'd love to play your stuff on the show.
[14:28.250 --> 14:29.450]  There's just a lot of artists out there
[14:29.450 --> 14:31.370]  that like to get their stuff exposed.
[14:31.370 --> 14:32.210]  Send me a message.
[14:32.210 --> 14:33.850]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:33.850 --> 14:34.970]  Love to listen to your tracks,
[14:34.970 --> 14:36.170]  see what kind of music you got.
[14:36.170 --> 14:37.850]  I'll put it in the background, I'll play it at the start,
[14:37.850 --> 14:39.690]  I'll play it at the end, we'll see what you got.
[14:40.810 --> 14:41.650]  That's a good idea.
[14:41.650 --> 14:43.930]  I'm curious what that just did to your inbox.
[14:43.930 --> 14:44.770]  Yeah, I love it.
[14:44.770 --> 14:46.330]  I love when my inbox explodes.
[14:46.330 --> 14:47.610]  That's what they're for.
[14:47.610 --> 14:49.950]  You're supposed to get your message box filled with stuff.
[14:49.950 --> 14:51.090]  It's not supposed to sit there.
[14:51.090 --> 14:52.570]  Interact with me, guys, I love it.
[14:52.570 --> 14:54.130]  Send me some music.
[14:54.130 --> 14:55.530]  I wanna hear what kind of music you got for me.
[14:55.890 --> 14:56.730]  Of course I like reggae.
[14:56.730 --> 14:58.090]  It doesn't have to be reggae.
[14:58.090 --> 14:59.210]  Well produced.
[14:59.210 --> 15:00.970]  If you're gonna send me something to start a show with.
[15:00.970 --> 15:05.770]  Let's enunciate that it doesn't have to be reggae.
[15:05.770 --> 15:07.010]  That's true.
[15:07.010 --> 15:09.770]  But if it's an intro track, it's gotta kick in the door.
[15:09.770 --> 15:11.810]  Like, bow, what up, it's Rasta Jeff.
[15:11.810 --> 15:14.010]  It's just gotta be fucking, it's gotta hit.
[15:14.970 --> 15:18.410]  Can I shout someone out that might be able to help you out?
[15:18.410 --> 15:22.310]  Marc LeBlanc or Project 432.
[15:23.490 --> 15:24.850]  I've seen Project 432.
[15:25.170 --> 15:27.530]  I've seen those guys at the Black Sheep a couple of times.
[15:27.530 --> 15:29.090]  They opened for a lot of other acts.
[15:29.090 --> 15:31.890]  I think I saw them open for Morgan Heritage one night.
[15:31.890 --> 15:33.250]  Good band.
[15:33.250 --> 15:35.650]  Pretty decent bros with the drummer, Marc LeBlanc.
[15:37.290 --> 15:39.130]  If he's listening or whatever,
[15:39.130 --> 15:40.450]  I'll make sure I share this with him.
[15:40.450 --> 15:42.610]  If you guys have a dub track that you recorded.
[15:42.610 --> 15:44.050]  They got all kinds of extra stuff
[15:44.050 --> 15:45.530]  that they just jacked around with.
[15:45.530 --> 15:47.490]  I'm sure that they have it put on their albums and stuff.
[15:47.490 --> 15:50.210]  So if they got something that they wanna throw down,
[15:50.210 --> 15:51.190]  that would be awesome.
[15:51.190 --> 15:53.450]  I can layer all of the voicing over it.
[15:53.450 --> 15:55.170]  Of course, I've got mics and editing gear.
[15:55.170 --> 15:57.530]  So just give me some backing tracks
[15:57.530 --> 15:58.850]  and I'll do all the work.
[15:58.850 --> 16:01.250]  If you got something like 45 seconds long,
[16:01.250 --> 16:02.410]  something about two minutes long,
[16:02.410 --> 16:04.570]  and then something like 10 minutes long,
[16:04.570 --> 16:06.890]  but I would use all of those in certain spots.
[16:06.890 --> 16:09.410]  Yeah, if you're listening, go check out Project 432.
[16:09.410 --> 16:11.130]  They're a pretty good band.
[16:11.130 --> 16:11.950]  They're pretty new.
[16:11.950 --> 16:14.490]  They've been out a little over a year
[16:14.490 --> 16:15.610]  and they're doing some big things.
[16:15.610 --> 16:17.130]  So go check them out. The drummer's pretty good.
[16:17.130 --> 16:18.330]  Drummer's pretty hot.
[16:18.330 --> 16:19.770]  He's been through a lot of bands.
[16:19.770 --> 16:22.490]  He's been drumming since literally he was one.
[16:22.490 --> 16:23.530]  There's a picture of him with a drum set.
[16:23.530 --> 16:24.370]  And they're youngsters.
[16:24.370 --> 16:25.650]  They're young dudes.
[16:25.650 --> 16:28.290]  So they've got a lot of young cat energy.
[16:28.290 --> 16:30.770]  They don't have the same, that old reggae guy energy.
[16:30.770 --> 16:32.330]  They got youngster reggae energy.
[16:32.330 --> 16:33.570]  It's different.
[16:33.570 --> 16:34.890]  Mike's rolling his eyes.
[16:34.890 --> 16:37.930]  No, I'm just trying to picture young reggae.
[16:38.850 --> 16:40.410]  Revolution versus Bob Marley.
[16:40.410 --> 16:41.370]  Do you have any idea how hard it's been
[16:41.370 --> 16:43.490]  not to fucking give him a little poke in right now
[16:43.490 --> 16:45.010]  and now you're gonna tease one out of me?
[16:45.010 --> 16:45.850]  I know.
[16:45.850 --> 16:48.570]  Dude, if one reggae song's been flagged by YouTube,
[16:48.570 --> 16:49.970]  how are the rest getting by?
[16:50.930 --> 16:52.690]  Mike's not a fan of reggae.
[16:52.690 --> 16:53.890]  No, it's not that at all.
[16:53.890 --> 16:56.050]  It's just you asked, so you got the poke.
[16:56.050 --> 16:57.210]  Boom, chicka.
[16:57.210 --> 16:58.050]  Boom, chicka.
[16:58.050 --> 17:00.490]  Yeah, see, if that got flagged in one song,
[17:00.490 --> 17:01.730]  doesn't it catch it in all of them?
[17:01.730 --> 17:02.570]  Ouch.
[17:02.570 --> 17:03.770]  All right, Mike's trying to stab at us.
[17:03.770 --> 17:05.970]  You guys, this podcast is not gonna be one of the episodes
[17:05.970 --> 17:07.010]  where you need to get out a notebook
[17:07.010 --> 17:08.610]  and take a bunch of notes, apparently.
[17:08.610 --> 17:10.490]  This is gonna be one where Kevin and Mike and myself
[17:10.490 --> 17:13.170]  get really high and hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[17:13.170 --> 17:14.490]  And we're gonna teach you about what it's like
[17:14.490 --> 17:16.330]  in the studio when we all baked as fuck.
[17:16.330 --> 17:18.170]  Yeah, you guys are kinda just joining us at the table.
[17:18.170 --> 17:19.010]  You can hear Mike's water bottle popping.
[17:19.330 --> 17:21.450]  I open containers and just keep teasing me.
[17:21.450 --> 17:22.290]  Take a dab, bro.
[17:22.290 --> 17:23.130]  Don't be afraid to take a dab.
[17:23.130 --> 17:23.970]  I don't have to do it.
[17:23.970 --> 17:25.730]  I talk myself out of it, but get yourself one.
[17:25.730 --> 17:26.570]  Yeah, take a dab.
[17:26.570 --> 17:27.410]  Don't be shy.
[17:27.410 --> 17:28.290]  I've been talking myself out of it
[17:28.290 --> 17:30.290]  because I've had quite a few so far.
[17:30.290 --> 17:31.410]  Here's a dabber.
[17:31.410 --> 17:32.250]  Don't be afraid.
[17:32.250 --> 17:34.010]  As long as I can keep talking, everything will be okay.
[17:34.010 --> 17:35.130]  I'm not afraid.
[17:35.130 --> 17:39.130]  Yeah, no one else saw us devolve into giggles for.
[17:39.130 --> 17:41.730]  I don't get afraid of really anything dab related.
[17:41.730 --> 17:45.650]  Not taking more dabs, not anything dab related.
[17:45.650 --> 17:47.810]  Wait till Jeff turns the fucking sound off
[17:47.850 --> 17:49.850]  in your headphones as you're hitting it.
[17:51.490 --> 17:53.210]  So I turned off Mike's mic because I knew
[17:53.210 --> 17:56.370]  he was gonna cough and he thought he went deaf.
[17:56.370 --> 17:58.770]  The sound in my headphones went too
[17:58.770 --> 18:01.210]  and when I realized that I exclaimed,
[18:01.210 --> 18:02.930]  I'm so glad that's not the weed.
[18:05.170 --> 18:07.290]  And I wish I had been recording, but unfortunately I was not.
[18:07.290 --> 18:09.730]  It was one of those beautiful moments, but yes.
[18:09.730 --> 18:11.450]  Oh, I could not stop laughing over that.
[18:11.450 --> 18:13.410]  One of those fun side effects of fucking
[18:13.410 --> 18:16.170]  all the anti-weed propaganda I sift through every day
[18:16.210 --> 18:18.570]  is like every time I get a good hit
[18:18.570 --> 18:20.050]  and it rings my bell a minute, I'm like,
[18:20.050 --> 18:22.250]  ooh, is this the weed psychosis I've heard about?
[18:22.250 --> 18:24.130]  Am I finally gonna see some shit?
[18:25.210 --> 18:27.570]  And no, I just get a little higher
[18:27.570 --> 18:30.170]  and then giggle for a minute and then come back down.
[18:31.490 --> 18:35.090]  You haven't gone crazy yet from the devil weed?
[18:35.090 --> 18:35.930]  Not yet.
[18:35.930 --> 18:36.770]  Not yet.
[18:36.770 --> 18:37.610]  From the devil's lettuce.
[18:37.610 --> 18:38.650]  Never gonna stop trying.
[18:38.650 --> 18:40.050]  Yeah.
[18:40.050 --> 18:42.890]  They say you can't OD on cannabis, but I've been trying.
[18:42.970 --> 18:46.610]  You know, I'm starting to get to the point to think
[18:46.610 --> 18:49.610]  where you might be able to with all the new distillations
[18:49.610 --> 18:50.450]  and stuff.
[18:50.450 --> 18:52.330]  If you took like a big two liter or something
[18:52.330 --> 18:55.370]  and like drank it of like distillate,
[18:55.370 --> 18:58.450]  probably would get pretty sick, I'd imagine.
[18:58.450 --> 18:59.810]  Please don't do that.
[18:59.810 --> 19:00.890]  Don't ever try that.
[19:00.890 --> 19:02.610]  If you've got a two liter of distillate though,
[19:02.610 --> 19:03.450]  let's kick it.
[19:04.890 --> 19:07.730]  I'm just saying like the original equation
[19:07.730 --> 19:12.490]  was something like 45 hay bales worth of bud
[19:13.050 --> 19:16.370]  in like an hour is what it would take
[19:16.370 --> 19:19.570]  to even approach a lethal dose.
[19:19.570 --> 19:21.930]  And when they did the conversion,
[19:21.930 --> 19:25.890]  like they were probably working with five or 7% THC herb.
[19:25.890 --> 19:27.770]  See, that's kind of what I was thinking.
[19:27.770 --> 19:28.610]  And-
[19:28.610 --> 19:30.050]  That's what I've been pondering.
[19:30.050 --> 19:32.050]  If you got pure enough distillate
[19:32.050 --> 19:33.650]  in a big enough batch of it,
[19:35.650 --> 19:37.570]  you still gotta get it into the person
[19:37.570 --> 19:39.810]  and get it absorbed at that point.
[19:39.810 --> 19:42.090]  Like if you try to drink a two liter of distillate
[19:42.090 --> 19:43.170]  about your third gulp,
[19:43.170 --> 19:45.890]  your body's just gonna vomit up four cups of distillate
[19:45.890 --> 19:46.730]  and all your boys are gonna laugh at you.
[19:46.730 --> 19:49.370]  Well, I mean even three big gulps of like-
[19:49.370 --> 19:50.850]  Yeah, but that's just a little coating.
[19:50.850 --> 19:53.290]  I don't think you can get it down.
[19:53.290 --> 19:54.970]  I don't think my body would even let me.
[19:54.970 --> 19:56.530]  That's like trying to swallow a mouthful
[19:56.530 --> 19:57.370]  of a whole cup of honey.
[19:57.370 --> 19:59.010]  I've never tried and I don't plan to.
[19:59.010 --> 20:02.650]  If anybody would like to donate a cup of distillate,
[20:02.650 --> 20:03.490]  we'd like to see Kevin-
[20:03.490 --> 20:04.330]  It's R&B.
[20:04.330 --> 20:09.330]  It's for science, bro, for science.
[20:10.090 --> 20:13.130]  I'm down to drive to the devil's house with you, bro.
[20:13.130 --> 20:15.330]  So two cups, I'm not in on this.
[20:15.330 --> 20:17.450]  I will keep my throat clear and keep talking.
[20:17.450 --> 20:20.490]  I'm on videotape for fucking research purposes.
[20:20.490 --> 20:23.130]  I'll put up the iPad with the fish eye lens for this shit.
[20:23.130 --> 20:25.010]  We'll get it going.
[20:25.010 --> 20:27.490]  You're making me want to do this, which is not good.
[20:27.490 --> 20:29.890]  Nobody drink a cup of distillate, please.
[20:29.890 --> 20:31.010]  And if you do, don't blame me.
[20:31.010 --> 20:32.530]  I'm saying it's a bad idea.
[20:32.530 --> 20:34.210]  If only it were Friday.
[20:34.210 --> 20:35.810]  Do send us music.
[20:35.810 --> 20:36.890]  Don't drink distillate.
[20:36.890 --> 20:37.890]  Holy crap.
[20:38.210 --> 20:40.810]  Dues and don'ts of the podcast.
[20:40.810 --> 20:44.610]  Kevin's just going to giggle for the whole show now.
[20:44.610 --> 20:45.450]  All right.
[20:45.450 --> 20:46.290]  No, I'm good.
[20:46.290 --> 20:47.130]  How was that dab?
[20:47.130 --> 20:48.210]  It was delicious.
[20:48.210 --> 20:49.170]  What'd you dab, bro?
[20:49.170 --> 20:50.570]  What did I dab?
[20:50.570 --> 20:52.890]  Oh, I dabbed in croc and extracts.
[20:52.890 --> 20:57.010]  That was a legit question.
[20:57.010 --> 20:59.850]  He looked at the table in awe and had no idea for a moment.
[20:59.850 --> 21:01.130]  I've got hash to dab?
[21:01.130 --> 21:01.970]  Where did this come from?
[21:01.970 --> 21:05.810]  I'm pretty sure he had to lick the roof of his mouth to guess.
[21:05.850 --> 21:09.210]  I don't remember what it looked like on the dabber.
[21:09.210 --> 21:13.450]  It was this rock, rock extracts, rockstar kush.
[21:14.610 --> 21:17.130]  All right, let's get serious for a second on episode 300.
[21:17.130 --> 21:20.690]  We have done four years worth of podcasts, 300 shows.
[21:20.690 --> 21:23.490]  We had a hundred thousand downloads in February.
[21:23.490 --> 21:26.370]  Kevin hasn't consumed alcohol in 20 months.
[21:26.370 --> 21:27.890]  There's so many things to be grateful for.
[21:27.890 --> 21:30.850]  Mike's got a healthy, healthy kid.
[21:30.850 --> 21:31.890]  Sorry, Mike, I'm trying to include you
[21:31.890 --> 21:32.890]  in all the celebration here.
[21:32.890 --> 21:35.330]  I have that and I've got another one on the way.
[21:35.850 --> 21:37.290]  I didn't know if I was supposed to mention that,
[21:37.290 --> 21:38.130]  so I hesitated.
[21:38.130 --> 21:40.010]  It ain't a secret, she's super pregnant.
[21:40.010 --> 21:41.570]  She's super pregnant now.
[21:41.570 --> 21:43.010]  There's no hiding it at this point.
[21:43.010 --> 21:45.450]  No, we're so far past 12 weeks.
[21:45.450 --> 21:47.090]  Well, congrats on the new one.
[21:47.090 --> 21:50.810]  Numero dos a comin', so if you like having me on the podcast,
[21:50.810 --> 21:52.850]  we're gonna have to figure out a new way to do this.
[21:52.850 --> 21:55.650]  We're gonna get Mike a small setup with a microphone
[21:55.650 --> 21:56.890]  that he can plug into his computer
[21:56.890 --> 21:59.050]  so that we can Skype and do shows together like that,
[21:59.050 --> 22:01.010]  so that he can have a kid on his lap and do a podcast.
[22:01.010 --> 22:02.450]  It'd be like a conference call.
[22:02.450 --> 22:04.290]  I can get away for an hour or two a night.
[22:04.330 --> 22:05.570]  I just can't leave the fuckin' house
[22:05.570 --> 22:07.090]  because the baby monitor has to be able
[22:07.090 --> 22:08.490]  to blink behind the microphone.
[22:08.490 --> 22:09.690]  Yeah, we got you there, bro.
[22:09.690 --> 22:10.530]  We'll set you up with something.
[22:10.530 --> 22:13.490]  I can't drive across town to fuckin' feed a kid a bottle
[22:13.490 --> 22:14.450]  or change a diaper.
[22:14.450 --> 22:16.730]  Once we get another MacBook to replace this thing
[22:16.730 --> 22:19.610]  that's going super slow, we'll get you a microphone
[22:19.610 --> 22:20.970]  that just plugs right into your computer.
[22:20.970 --> 22:22.530]  I'll teach you how to use a program.
[22:22.530 --> 22:23.850]  All you gotta do is open up Skype.
[22:23.850 --> 22:24.690]  We'll talk on Skype.
[22:24.690 --> 22:25.690]  We'll record you.
[22:25.690 --> 22:26.530]  We'll do the same thing.
[22:26.530 --> 22:29.450]  You can ramble with me on Skype just like you can from here.
[22:29.450 --> 22:30.330]  Boom.
[22:30.330 --> 22:32.410]  Sounds like a good way to produce a fuckload of content.
[22:32.410 --> 22:34.210]  And you could probably smoke cigarettes.
[22:34.930 --> 22:36.570]  You can't do that here.
[22:36.570 --> 22:37.810]  Cigarette-free zone.
[22:37.810 --> 22:39.890]  Yeah, I have a tobacco-friendly office.
[22:40.770 --> 22:41.610]  That's true.
[22:41.610 --> 22:42.810]  We've got a lot.
[22:42.810 --> 22:45.290]  We all have a lot of things to be grateful for.
[22:45.290 --> 22:47.410]  I'm grateful for all the people that download,
[22:47.410 --> 22:50.370]  listen, support, talk about, share.
[22:50.370 --> 22:51.210]  What's vibrate?
[22:51.210 --> 22:52.050]  Who is that?
[22:52.050 --> 22:53.570]  Damn, Mike, your phone is angry.
[22:55.210 --> 22:57.170]  I thought there were motorcycles coming or something.
[22:57.170 --> 22:58.010]  I was like, what is that?
[22:58.010 --> 22:59.810]  Are the ninjas here?
[22:59.810 --> 23:00.890]  Damn.
[23:00.890 --> 23:02.410]  Like a dildo race.
[23:02.690 --> 23:06.050]  No, that was just the vibrate feature on the new phone.
[23:06.050 --> 23:08.530]  I haven't learned all the bells and whistles yet.
[23:08.530 --> 23:09.370]  All right.
[23:09.370 --> 23:10.210]  Sorry.
[23:11.290 --> 23:13.330]  Hey, fucking 300 shows is the first one
[23:13.330 --> 23:14.850]  I think I've interrupted with a cell phone,
[23:14.850 --> 23:18.090]  so I've got that to be grateful for.
[23:18.090 --> 23:18.930]  All right.
[23:18.930 --> 23:20.290]  We'll put it back on track.
[23:20.290 --> 23:21.650]  Always something new here.
[23:21.650 --> 23:24.010]  I'm grateful for all the people that support the show.
[23:24.010 --> 23:27.970]  People have been supporting on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
[23:27.970 --> 23:29.850]  through Patreon quite a bit.
[23:29.850 --> 23:30.770]  People are reaching out.
[23:30.810 --> 23:33.090]  I get private messages on all of my social media
[23:33.090 --> 23:35.090]  and they say, hey dude, thanks for the podcast.
[23:35.090 --> 23:37.010]  People tell me that I brighten up their day.
[23:37.010 --> 23:39.970]  People tell me that our interactions
[23:39.970 --> 23:41.090]  help them with their life.
[23:41.090 --> 23:43.650]  They just change their attitude, their approach to life.
[23:43.650 --> 23:45.250]  Apparently I'm the only person
[23:45.250 --> 23:47.890]  that some people interact with, which is kind of neat.
[23:47.890 --> 23:50.690]  I'm kind of, I don't know.
[23:50.690 --> 23:52.010]  I'd rather not go out in public
[23:52.010 --> 23:53.530]  and deal with a lot of people sometimes.
[23:53.530 --> 23:55.970]  It's just, it doesn't seem like that once you know me.
[23:55.970 --> 23:58.330]  That's one of our community character traits.
[23:58.330 --> 23:59.170]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:59.170 --> 24:00.010]  We see more often than not.
[24:00.330 --> 24:02.370]  I was a grower for so long that I just became a hermit
[24:02.370 --> 24:03.570]  and didn't want to deal with other people
[24:03.570 --> 24:06.650]  because then they were probably snitches or thieves or cops
[24:06.650 --> 24:09.410]  or a problem if they weren't somebody that I already knew.
[24:09.410 --> 24:11.290]  So it kind of made me weird, you're right.
[24:11.290 --> 24:13.690]  But I get a lot of my social interaction
[24:13.690 --> 24:15.570]  from the social media,
[24:15.570 --> 24:17.410]  people that listen to the show and interact with me.
[24:17.410 --> 24:20.530]  So you guys mean a lot to me also, and I appreciate that.
[24:20.530 --> 24:22.210]  And all the support,
[24:22.210 --> 24:24.050]  we do put a lot of work into the show.
[24:24.050 --> 24:24.930]  It sounds like a bunch of dudes
[24:24.930 --> 24:25.970]  just sitting here getting stoned.
[24:25.970 --> 24:27.810]  Today, yes it is.
[24:27.810 --> 24:29.450]  200 and something other episodes
[24:29.810 --> 24:31.490]  of me putting a lot of work into this podcast.
[24:31.490 --> 24:32.650]  I do a lot of research.
[24:32.650 --> 24:34.330]  I've got, you guys can testify.
[24:34.330 --> 24:35.330]  Dude, for this show,
[24:35.330 --> 24:37.850]  there's a notebook and like three days of planning.
[24:37.850 --> 24:39.810]  Yeah, yeah, just to get these guys here
[24:39.810 --> 24:41.010]  like is an orchestration,
[24:41.010 --> 24:43.010]  just to get three growers in a room together.
[24:43.010 --> 24:44.450]  It takes a lot, but I've got-
[24:44.450 --> 24:45.450]  Oh, you called me a grower.
[24:45.450 --> 24:48.010]  Well, we're all in the industry, it's the same thing.
[24:48.010 --> 24:49.370]  But I've got notebooks here, you guys.
[24:49.370 --> 24:51.830]  I've got notes and days worth of content prepared and stuff.
[24:51.830 --> 24:53.130]  There is a lot of work that goes into this.
[24:53.130 --> 24:54.570]  So for everyone to reach out and say,
[24:54.570 --> 24:55.490]  hey, we love the show.
[24:55.490 --> 24:57.450]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[24:57.450 --> 24:58.770]  Throwing down on Patreon.
[24:58.770 --> 25:00.450]  All of that means a ton to me.
[25:00.450 --> 25:01.410]  I appreciate it.
[25:01.410 --> 25:02.250]  I'm grateful.
[25:02.250 --> 25:05.570]  I'm trying to express gratitude as clearly as possible.
[25:05.570 --> 25:07.650]  Four years, holy crap.
[25:07.650 --> 25:08.490]  That's awesome.
[25:08.490 --> 25:11.810]  I remember when you were talking about the idea of doing it
[25:11.810 --> 25:15.810]  and how excited you were about like doing this concept
[25:15.810 --> 25:20.810]  and sharing cannabis news and just grow tips
[25:21.170 --> 25:23.250]  and whatever you could, just knowledge
[25:23.250 --> 25:26.650]  and your love for the plant and industry and patients.
[25:26.650 --> 25:29.650]  And it was awesome to see that from the beginning
[25:29.650 --> 25:32.970]  and to have you still here with the same passion
[25:32.970 --> 25:35.770]  and love for it and even more so have developed it
[25:35.770 --> 25:39.530]  into a semi comedy podcast as well
[25:39.530 --> 25:41.730]  and have made it a super fun time
[25:41.730 --> 25:44.010]  along with getting all of the information across
[25:44.010 --> 25:46.870]  and sharing the lives of your friends
[25:46.870 --> 25:50.750]  and fellow cannabis industry people, which is amazing.
[25:50.750 --> 25:54.650]  You're spreading a lot more than yourself, which is awesome
[25:54.650 --> 25:58.250]  because a lot of people just kind of get their self
[25:58.250 --> 26:00.890]  and their idea out there and you do a lot more than that.
[26:00.890 --> 26:04.450]  You speak for most of us.
[26:04.450 --> 26:08.210]  There was another show that I caught advertising.
[26:08.210 --> 26:10.250]  If you wrote them an email and said, I have spider mites,
[26:10.250 --> 26:11.670]  they'd say, buy this product.
[26:11.670 --> 26:13.230]  And you would hear him talk about that product
[26:13.230 --> 26:14.250]  through the entire episode.
[26:14.250 --> 26:16.450]  And I felt that that was kind of shitty.
[26:16.450 --> 26:17.490]  But I didn't want to do that.
[26:17.490 --> 26:19.410]  Yes, I do advertise things, you guys,
[26:19.410 --> 26:21.890]  but you notice I've got two advertisers on this episode.
[26:21.890 --> 26:23.050]  You haven't heard anything about them.
[26:23.050 --> 26:24.210]  You're one at the start of the show.
[26:24.770 --> 26:26.610]  You'll hear one later, two brief advertisements.
[26:26.610 --> 26:28.730]  I'm not gonna bombard you with them the whole show.
[26:28.730 --> 26:29.790]  It's people that want to support me.
[26:29.790 --> 26:31.210]  They want their product known.
[26:31.210 --> 26:32.130]  I'm not gonna crush you with it.
[26:32.130 --> 26:33.530]  I try to put out, like Kev said,
[26:33.530 --> 26:35.090]  I try to put out a genuine show.
[26:35.090 --> 26:36.390]  I don't have a filter.
[26:36.390 --> 26:39.050]  I couldn't keep shit back if I wanted to, I don't think.
[26:39.050 --> 26:40.690]  So I just come out and express myself.
[26:40.690 --> 26:43.890]  And I think it's hilarious that people have started saying
[26:43.890 --> 26:46.170]  that my show has got a touch of comedy to it
[26:46.170 --> 26:47.890]  because that wasn't what I intended at all
[26:47.890 --> 26:48.730]  when I started this.
[26:48.730 --> 26:49.610]  Yeah, no, it wasn't.
[26:49.610 --> 26:52.150]  It was to spread information and knowledge
[26:52.190 --> 26:54.630]  on what's happening within the industry
[26:54.630 --> 26:57.430]  so people could experience it and understand.
[26:57.430 --> 26:59.030]  The first hundred episodes, sorry, Mike,
[26:59.030 --> 27:00.430]  I keep interrupting you.
[27:00.430 --> 27:03.270]  The first hundred episodes are me reading a script
[27:03.270 --> 27:04.650]  because I wanted to be so,
[27:04.650 --> 27:05.910]  I didn't want to make any mistakes.
[27:05.910 --> 27:08.910]  I knew the magnitude of my advice to people
[27:08.910 --> 27:09.990]  because they trust me, you know what I mean?
[27:09.990 --> 27:12.150]  I'm going out there saying, I'm the guy to listen to.
[27:12.150 --> 27:13.450]  I better get it fucking right.
[27:13.450 --> 27:15.390]  I don't want to make, however many people listen
[27:15.390 --> 27:17.750]  to that episode, they may ruin their garden.
[27:17.750 --> 27:20.670]  So I didn't, but I don't remember where I was going.
[27:20.670 --> 27:21.630]  Go ahead, Mike, I keep cutting you off.
[27:22.070 --> 27:24.030]  One of the things that, I mean,
[27:24.030 --> 27:26.630]  it wasn't there as much in the beginning,
[27:26.630 --> 27:28.550]  but there was still a good part of this
[27:28.550 --> 27:30.470]  and it's grown to be a bigger part of the show
[27:30.470 --> 27:33.470]  over the years, but like, it's highly educational,
[27:33.470 --> 27:35.710]  but it doesn't feel like school or class.
[27:35.710 --> 27:37.710]  Yeah, it doesn't feel like you're sitting there
[27:37.710 --> 27:41.110]  trying to learn stuff, but you learn a whole bunch.
[27:41.110 --> 27:43.350]  That's the idea because I wasn't a good student
[27:43.350 --> 27:44.650]  because school was like that,
[27:44.650 --> 27:46.810]  but I had a few teachers that knew that about me.
[27:46.810 --> 27:47.910]  Shout out to the good teachers,
[27:47.910 --> 27:49.750]  teachers that are good, I love you.
[27:49.750 --> 27:51.110]  Because all three of us in this room
[27:51.110 --> 27:52.350]  are bad fucking students.
[27:53.910 --> 27:56.430]  Mike's a Ginko kid, like Kevin's a tattoo kid.
[27:56.430 --> 27:57.830]  I'm fucking Rasta Jeff.
[27:57.830 --> 27:59.590]  Like we were the kids that were sneaking off
[27:59.590 --> 28:00.430]  getting high together.
[28:00.430 --> 28:02.030]  We all went to different schools at different times,
[28:02.030 --> 28:04.790]  but if we knew each other, you would've been suspended
[28:04.790 --> 28:06.710]  for smoking weed together all the time.
[28:06.710 --> 28:07.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:07.870 --> 28:10.470]  So we were bad students.
[28:10.470 --> 28:13.230]  If we had good teachers, I would've gone to school more.
[28:13.230 --> 28:15.550]  I had a few teachers, a band teacher
[28:15.550 --> 28:17.590]  that saved my whole school fucking thing.
[28:17.630 --> 28:20.030]  Without him, I would've quit going to school.
[28:20.030 --> 28:21.970]  He was like, man, you have to be here,
[28:21.970 --> 28:23.110]  you're gonna fuck your life up.
[28:23.110 --> 28:24.230]  Because he knew that I would just show up
[28:24.230 --> 28:25.290]  baked for that class.
[28:25.290 --> 28:27.950]  And he'd be like, I'll give you five band classes a day.
[28:27.950 --> 28:29.830]  And I got to be in like jazz band, orchestra,
[28:29.830 --> 28:33.390]  concert band, marching band, recess band basically.
[28:33.390 --> 28:34.830]  He's like, just come hang out.
[28:34.830 --> 28:36.210]  I don't have a class this period,
[28:36.210 --> 28:37.710]  but just be here, whatever.
[28:37.710 --> 28:40.110]  But yeah, good teachers make a huge difference.
[28:40.110 --> 28:42.150]  So I'm glad that I make it easy for people to learn.
[28:42.150 --> 28:42.990]  That's really, means a lot.
[28:42.990 --> 28:45.310]  There's a guy for me that wasn't really directly my teacher,
[28:45.310 --> 28:47.510]  but he was a professor at one time.
[28:48.330 --> 28:49.150]  I think you know him, Ray Greeson.
[28:49.150 --> 28:51.150]  Oh yeah, I know Ray, hippie Ray, rainbow Ray.
[28:51.150 --> 28:54.070]  He did a lot for me in my young childhood
[28:54.070 --> 28:57.870]  and all the way through my life as far as education-wise
[28:57.870 --> 29:00.910]  and how much I am into the sciences and math
[29:00.910 --> 29:02.950]  and how I can understand it and everything.
[29:02.950 --> 29:04.230]  He did a whole lot.
[29:04.230 --> 29:06.630]  Did he ever kick your ass at chess?
[29:07.630 --> 29:08.470]  Yeah.
[29:08.470 --> 29:09.310]  Yeah.
[29:09.310 --> 29:10.130]  Yeah.
[29:10.130 --> 29:10.970]  Yeah.
[29:10.970 --> 29:12.850]  Dude, he had a real big sheepish grin
[29:12.850 --> 29:13.690]  right before he answered.
[29:13.690 --> 29:14.510]  Play him once.
[29:14.510 --> 29:16.470]  Go over it and you're like, oh wow.
[29:16.470 --> 29:17.390]  That wasn't even fun.
[29:18.230 --> 29:19.070]  I didn't even get to move.
[29:19.070 --> 29:21.830]  Like damn, how did you, like I'm embarrassed.
[29:21.830 --> 29:23.510]  Yeah, my grandpa taught me to play chess
[29:23.510 --> 29:25.270]  and Ray would have just destroyed my gramps
[29:25.270 --> 29:27.270]  and I have nothing but respect for my gramps.
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.670]  It's embarrassing how good he is.
[29:28.670 --> 29:31.030]  He makes lunar calendars every year
[29:31.030 --> 29:32.670]  under the name Pueblo Fish.
[29:32.670 --> 29:36.350]  So if anybody runs across that name or whatever,
[29:36.350 --> 29:39.690]  Ray Greeson, he's a super cool dude to hang out with.
[29:39.690 --> 29:41.270]  Talk to him, he'll talk to you
[29:41.270 --> 29:42.590]  about whatever you want to talk about.
[29:42.590 --> 29:44.510]  I think he still does.
[29:44.510 --> 29:46.010]  He works all winter and on the summer,
[29:46.010 --> 29:47.810]  he goes and follows the rainbow family.
[29:47.810 --> 29:49.410]  He goes to all the rainbow gatherings.
[29:49.410 --> 29:51.730]  He does some traveling and stuff like that in the summer
[29:51.730 --> 29:54.290]  and then he comes usually back around this area
[29:54.290 --> 29:57.690]  in the wintertime and it'd be cool to run into him.
[29:57.690 --> 29:59.210]  He usually, I'm on his mailing list
[29:59.210 --> 30:01.850]  for the lunar calendar, so I should be getting that
[30:01.850 --> 30:02.770]  at some point.
[30:02.770 --> 30:03.610]  It's pretty awesome.
[30:03.610 --> 30:04.570]  It's like a little spiral calendar.
[30:04.570 --> 30:05.410]  The weird people you mail around to here.
[30:05.410 --> 30:08.170]  That's like the most Pueblo story I've heard in a while.
[30:08.170 --> 30:09.010]  All right.
[30:09.010 --> 30:10.170]  I remember what I was talking about earlier
[30:10.170 --> 30:12.290]  when I was talking about all my stuff sounded scripted.
[30:12.290 --> 30:13.690]  I used to write shit out
[30:13.690 --> 30:15.010]  because I didn't want to screw anybody up.
[30:15.530 --> 30:16.370]  They were word for word.
[30:16.370 --> 30:19.370]  You used to sit here and research different topics.
[30:19.370 --> 30:21.250]  You'd like, I want to write a show on blank.
[30:21.250 --> 30:23.050]  I know enough about it to do a show
[30:23.050 --> 30:26.130]  and you'd still spend two weeks researching
[30:26.130 --> 30:26.970]  everything else you could find on a topic.
[30:26.970 --> 30:28.810]  I feel like I'm confident enough now
[30:28.810 --> 30:32.030]  and now I'm so confident that I've gotten 300 episodes,
[30:32.030 --> 30:34.530]  dude, I can sit here, I could tell you about anything.
[30:34.530 --> 30:35.370]  I'm not shy.
[30:35.370 --> 30:36.890]  I'll tell you everything you want to know about my life
[30:36.890 --> 30:37.970]  now on the podcast.
[30:37.970 --> 30:39.850]  I love it because it gives me,
[30:39.850 --> 30:41.570]  I said accountability earlier.
[30:41.570 --> 30:43.350]  I can't talk shit now.
[30:43.350 --> 30:45.510]  I have to rethink everything I'm about to say.
[30:45.510 --> 30:47.070]  I've said things that I've exaggerated
[30:47.070 --> 30:49.030]  and be like, no, wait, wait, wait, I might be wrong.
[30:49.030 --> 30:50.310]  I like, maybe I'm wrong on that.
[30:50.310 --> 30:51.130]  Maybe I'm exaggerating.
[30:51.130 --> 30:52.070]  Maybe I don't remember that story right.
[30:52.070 --> 30:52.910]  And I have to like think about it
[30:52.910 --> 30:54.470]  because I'm like, I'm being recorded.
[30:54.470 --> 30:56.030]  I don't want to even fucking,
[30:56.030 --> 30:57.750]  I have to get the details right right now.
[30:57.750 --> 30:58.590]  And it does something
[30:58.590 --> 31:00.150]  and it also makes me a better speaker
[31:00.150 --> 31:01.550]  and a better communicator,
[31:01.550 --> 31:02.670]  but I've gotten really comfortable.
[31:02.670 --> 31:04.830]  I did, I got to give a shout out to somebody else too.
[31:04.830 --> 31:06.610]  I can't overlook this since I'm doing shout outs
[31:06.610 --> 31:09.550]  and giving gratitude and respect to people.
[31:09.550 --> 31:10.770]  Wade Ridley, what's up, bro?
[31:10.770 --> 31:12.030]  I don't know if you listen to this podcast.
[31:12.030 --> 31:14.750]  I don't know, I don't know what happened, whatever.
[31:14.750 --> 31:17.190]  Shit fell apart there is our friendship, our podcast.
[31:17.190 --> 31:18.310]  We went separate ways.
[31:18.310 --> 31:20.830]  I got no animosity to you or for you,
[31:20.830 --> 31:22.130]  against you, with you, whatever.
[31:22.130 --> 31:23.230]  However, animosity works.
[31:23.230 --> 31:24.670]  I don't have any of it toward you.
[31:24.670 --> 31:26.010]  There we go.
[31:26.010 --> 31:28.550]  I did a podcast with a guy named Wade Ridley.
[31:28.550 --> 31:30.110]  It was called 719 the blocks.
[31:30.110 --> 31:34.030]  I was hired, I guess, to be the producer.
[31:34.030 --> 31:36.070]  I was supposed to sit here and run the microphones
[31:36.070 --> 31:37.110]  and keep the show working
[31:37.110 --> 31:39.310]  and host a place for the podcast to happen.
[31:40.230 --> 31:41.310]  I have a big ass mouth.
[31:41.630 --> 31:43.670]  I just couldn't be quiet and Wade likes my opinions
[31:43.670 --> 31:44.950]  and we didn't have a guest one time.
[31:44.950 --> 31:46.590]  So it was just him and I and I would talk a lot.
[31:46.590 --> 31:48.630]  I guess I was his Lee Syatt, if you will.
[31:49.890 --> 31:54.290]  And Wade and I did approximately 75 episodes
[31:54.290 --> 31:56.950]  of the 719 the blocks podcast together.
[31:56.950 --> 32:00.310]  He kind of taught me sort of how to podcast.
[32:00.310 --> 32:02.710]  He let me embarrass myself.
[32:02.710 --> 32:05.410]  Yeah, he let me embarrass myself on a few of his shows
[32:05.410 --> 32:06.790]  before I had my own.
[32:06.790 --> 32:07.830]  So that was cool.
[32:07.830 --> 32:09.050]  Shout out to Wade.
[32:09.050 --> 32:09.890]  Bro, we're cool.
[32:09.890 --> 32:10.870]  If you ever see me, high five me.
[32:11.390 --> 32:12.230]  I got a dab for you.
[32:12.230 --> 32:13.050]  We'll be all right.
[32:13.050 --> 32:13.890]  I got to say the same thing.
[32:13.890 --> 32:15.510]  I haven't talked to you for a minute, bro.
[32:15.510 --> 32:17.350]  And if you're listening, dude,
[32:17.350 --> 32:19.990]  like it would be cool to reconnect and see what's up.
[32:19.990 --> 32:21.270]  I don't know exactly what happened.
[32:21.270 --> 32:22.350]  I probably have a good idea.
[32:22.350 --> 32:23.190]  I was a shit head.
[32:23.190 --> 32:27.230]  So, but I mean, it would be cool to link back up with you,
[32:27.230 --> 32:28.070]  man.
[32:28.070 --> 32:28.890]  You were a big part of my life
[32:28.890 --> 32:29.730]  and did quite a few things
[32:29.730 --> 32:30.830]  that were pretty awesome for me too.
[32:30.830 --> 32:32.590]  So hope you're doing well, bro.
[32:32.590 --> 32:33.430]  Yeah.
[32:33.430 --> 32:34.250]  Shout out to Wade Ridley.
[32:34.250 --> 32:35.090]  Got me podcasting.
[32:35.090 --> 32:36.550]  Also shout out to John Doe radio.
[32:37.710 --> 32:38.670]  What up Tim Martin?
[32:39.270 --> 32:40.510]  Oh dang.
[32:40.510 --> 32:42.550]  Wade was the other dude
[32:42.550 --> 32:44.510]  for smoking weed for the news, right?
[32:44.510 --> 32:45.350]  Yeah.
[32:45.350 --> 32:46.170]  Yeah.
[32:46.170 --> 32:47.010]  That's what I thought.
[32:47.010 --> 32:47.850]  Yeah.
[32:47.850 --> 32:48.670]  Anybody I've smoked weed on the news with.
[32:48.670 --> 32:49.670]  I wasn't going to go that far into this.
[32:49.670 --> 32:50.990]  You guys, if you want,
[32:50.990 --> 32:52.310]  here's a brief history lesson then
[32:52.310 --> 32:53.990]  since Mike just linked all of that together for us.
[32:53.990 --> 32:54.830]  Brief history lesson.
[32:54.830 --> 32:55.750]  That shit was on the news like a month ago.
[32:55.750 --> 32:56.590]  That's what's in my head.
[32:56.590 --> 32:57.410]  Damn.
[32:57.410 --> 32:59.670]  So I was on 719 the blocks.
[32:59.670 --> 33:00.510]  Kevin brought,
[33:00.510 --> 33:03.270]  so I went to high school with not Wade,
[33:03.270 --> 33:04.450]  but I was in the same,
[33:04.450 --> 33:06.630]  I drank beer with the same people as Wade.
[33:06.630 --> 33:08.150]  He worked at a bar that I used to go to.
[33:08.670 --> 33:09.590]  We're the same age.
[33:09.590 --> 33:10.590]  He worked at Phil's.
[33:10.590 --> 33:11.830]  I used to go to Phil's.
[33:11.830 --> 33:12.670]  I'd get shit faced.
[33:12.670 --> 33:13.490]  We knew each other.
[33:13.490 --> 33:14.330]  We'd hang out.
[33:14.330 --> 33:15.510]  We knew all the same people.
[33:15.510 --> 33:16.830]  We got along,
[33:16.830 --> 33:18.470]  but never like hung out.
[33:18.470 --> 33:19.310]  You know what I mean?
[33:19.310 --> 33:20.130]  We all like,
[33:20.130 --> 33:22.250]  we're friends with Matt Tapia and Carl Grutt.
[33:22.250 --> 33:23.950]  Like we had so many common links.
[33:23.950 --> 33:24.790]  Yeah.
[33:24.790 --> 33:25.830]  But we had nothing against each other.
[33:25.830 --> 33:27.310]  We'd high five as we walked by,
[33:27.310 --> 33:28.150]  but we didn't,
[33:28.150 --> 33:29.610]  he'd never been to my house and shit.
[33:29.610 --> 33:30.450]  Then Kev was like,
[33:30.450 --> 33:31.270]  hey man,
[33:31.270 --> 33:32.110]  I've been hanging out with Wade Ridley.
[33:32.110 --> 33:32.950]  And I was like,
[33:32.950 --> 33:33.770]  man, bring him to the house.
[33:33.770 --> 33:34.610]  Like just fucking bring him by.
[33:34.610 --> 33:35.430]  He seems like a cool guy.
[33:35.430 --> 33:36.510]  I've always liked his vibe.
[33:38.710 --> 33:42.230]  And Wade and I loved hated each other.
[33:42.230 --> 33:43.590]  Like we agreed,
[33:43.590 --> 33:44.990]  disagreed on so much shit,
[33:44.990 --> 33:45.830]  but we were adults.
[33:45.830 --> 33:48.870]  And so we could have great disagreement conversations.
[33:48.870 --> 33:52.150]  And Wade loves to play devil's advocate just like I do.
[33:52.150 --> 33:53.910]  So we would both just troll each other.
[33:53.910 --> 33:54.750]  It does.
[33:54.750 --> 33:56.110]  It would get hot down in the basement.
[33:56.110 --> 33:58.230]  We'd have to come up here and smoke dabs and calm down
[33:58.230 --> 33:59.070]  and be like, bro,
[33:59.070 --> 34:00.930]  we can't have this conversation on the couch down here.
[34:00.930 --> 34:03.870]  We got to go into bigger space and get like fresh air
[34:03.870 --> 34:05.910]  and be a little further apart from each other.
[34:05.910 --> 34:07.430]  Cause this is getting weird.
[34:07.950 --> 34:09.430]  Sometimes we'd want to punch each other,
[34:09.430 --> 34:10.750]  but we'd be like, man, this is good.
[34:10.750 --> 34:11.710]  It's what we're asking for.
[34:11.710 --> 34:12.550]  You know what I mean?
[34:12.550 --> 34:13.890]  So we started a podcast together.
[34:13.890 --> 34:15.270]  He started a podcast and I was like,
[34:15.270 --> 34:16.430]  that needs love, dude.
[34:16.430 --> 34:17.470]  And he's like, what would you do?
[34:17.470 --> 34:18.750]  And I was like, I've got all this gear.
[34:18.750 --> 34:20.230]  I would plug all this gear into there.
[34:20.230 --> 34:21.430]  All my sound equipment.
[34:21.430 --> 34:23.110]  And he's like, oh, like he lit up.
[34:23.110 --> 34:25.470]  And so we started the podcast
[34:25.470 --> 34:27.470]  and then a fucking,
[34:27.470 --> 34:28.550]  we're doing a lot of podcasts.
[34:28.550 --> 34:30.670]  I would talk about cannabis occasionally
[34:30.670 --> 34:33.130]  and he would feel like he would give me this vibe of
[34:33.130 --> 34:34.770]  that's not what I want to be doing.
[34:34.770 --> 34:36.510]  Like he would kind of rush me through it.
[34:36.510 --> 34:39.830]  But then cannabis became recreational legal in Colorado.
[34:39.830 --> 34:42.030]  And I was the first person to purchase
[34:42.030 --> 34:44.470]  recreational cannabis in Pueblo, Colorado
[34:44.470 --> 34:47.190]  at the greener side on the South side at STEM beach.
[34:47.190 --> 34:49.190]  It's now called doctor's orders.
[34:49.190 --> 34:50.030]  It was the greener side.
[34:50.030 --> 34:51.270]  My buddy Hank used to own it.
[34:51.270 --> 34:53.110]  I was the first person to shop there.
[34:55.270 --> 34:58.090]  Wade and I, I got to be on the news for that.
[34:58.090 --> 35:01.430]  So Wade came here after, so I went back.
[35:01.430 --> 35:04.430]  Every news station in Colorado picked a dispensary
[35:04.430 --> 35:07.630]  kind of at random to do what Jeff did
[35:07.630 --> 35:10.350]  the day marijuana first became legal in Colorado.
[35:10.350 --> 35:14.710]  Like every news channel had their, the first customer.
[35:14.710 --> 35:16.270]  Yeah.
[35:16.270 --> 35:18.230]  And it was cool that you were the one down here for,
[35:18.230 --> 35:19.950]  I don't know what, KOA?
[35:19.950 --> 35:20.950]  I don't remember.
[35:20.950 --> 35:21.990]  Yeah, it was KOA 5 and 30.
[35:21.990 --> 35:22.830]  I'm pretty sure.
[35:22.830 --> 35:23.650]  I'm pretty sure.
[35:23.650 --> 35:26.650]  Michelle San Miguel was the reporter that helped me out.
[35:26.650 --> 35:30.070]  So I met up with Michelle right after I walk out
[35:30.070 --> 35:32.290]  and then we talked, she interviews me
[35:32.290 --> 35:34.390]  and then I come home and I call Wade.
[35:35.230 --> 35:36.070]  And I was like, where are you bro?
[35:36.070 --> 35:37.950]  We should record about this and put it on the podcast.
[35:37.950 --> 35:39.790]  And he came over here and he goes, I got a better idea.
[35:39.790 --> 35:41.390]  Let's go down there.
[35:41.390 --> 35:43.470]  And so we drove back to the greener side
[35:43.470 --> 35:45.670]  and Michelle San Miguel was still there.
[35:45.670 --> 35:46.870]  And she came up to me and she said,
[35:46.870 --> 35:48.470]  hey, do you have any of the weed you bought earlier?
[35:48.470 --> 35:49.630]  And I was like, no, it's at home.
[35:49.630 --> 35:52.130]  She goes, we want to watch people smoke.
[35:52.130 --> 35:54.470]  And I was like, oh, it's illegal to smoke out here.
[35:54.470 --> 35:56.270]  And Mike and I kind of looked at each other
[35:56.270 --> 35:59.410]  and Mike is, Mike's a little more level-headed than myself.
[35:59.410 --> 36:01.350]  Mike's a little, more of a different thinker.
[36:01.350 --> 36:03.710]  I got caught up in the spirit of the day.
[36:03.710 --> 36:05.150]  I'm a rebel.
[36:05.150 --> 36:06.430]  I'll cowboy the fuck up.
[36:06.430 --> 36:09.950]  I'm down to break the rules, obviously.
[36:09.950 --> 36:10.790]  And I looked at Mike.
[36:10.790 --> 36:11.910]  Well, it was an insane day.
[36:11.910 --> 36:14.030]  Like there was a dude driving by
[36:14.030 --> 36:15.990]  throwing weed and plants at people.
[36:15.990 --> 36:16.830]  Yeah, just passing out free plants and free clones.
[36:16.830 --> 36:19.350]  He had a truck bed full of four by four plants
[36:19.350 --> 36:21.070]  and he'd pull up and honk
[36:21.070 --> 36:23.150]  and half the line would run up to his truck
[36:23.150 --> 36:24.810]  and come back like, what do I do now?
[36:24.810 --> 36:26.990]  And then run their plant to their car.
[36:26.990 --> 36:30.750]  And then try to reform a quarter mile long line
[36:30.750 --> 36:32.630]  as best they could from memory.
[36:32.630 --> 36:35.190]  People were certainly smoking bowls and joints in that line
[36:35.190 --> 36:36.670]  and security guards were walking by going,
[36:36.670 --> 36:37.850]  please put that out guys.
[36:37.850 --> 36:38.690]  And they just walk away.
[36:38.690 --> 36:40.950]  They just, they'd have to do their job until you knock to.
[36:40.950 --> 36:42.150]  But they didn't do shit.
[36:42.150 --> 36:44.550]  There were helicopters overhead getting footage.
[36:44.550 --> 36:45.470]  Like it was crazy.
[36:45.470 --> 36:47.410]  Oh man, yeah, that was a chaotic day.
[36:47.410 --> 36:48.950]  But Michelle San Miguel was like,
[36:48.950 --> 36:51.230]  can we film you guys smoking somewhere?
[36:51.230 --> 36:52.750]  And I looked at Mike and Mike just came up with,
[36:52.750 --> 36:54.310]  yeah dude, I don't see why not.
[36:54.310 --> 36:55.230]  And I was looking for guidance.
[36:55.230 --> 36:57.190]  Like tell me why we can't go smoke weed at my house
[36:57.190 --> 36:58.230]  and let the news film it.
[36:58.230 --> 36:59.870]  And he had no reason why not.
[36:59.870 --> 37:02.350]  So I was like, yeah, my house, here's my address.
[37:03.070 --> 37:03.950]  And then she's like, we'll give you like an hour.
[37:03.950 --> 37:04.790]  We'll be there in an hour.
[37:04.790 --> 37:06.830]  So we drove here and everybody put on
[37:06.830 --> 37:08.470]  an iRegenetics t-shirt.
[37:08.470 --> 37:10.550]  Like everybody got all decked out.
[37:10.550 --> 37:11.830]  And then we cleaned up the table
[37:11.830 --> 37:13.150]  and put some props on the table.
[37:13.150 --> 37:15.090]  You know, like put the right products in the right places
[37:15.090 --> 37:16.350]  and did what we needed to do.
[37:16.350 --> 37:18.070]  And the news came here and filmed us,
[37:18.070 --> 37:20.250]  filmed me taking a big old dab on the news
[37:20.250 --> 37:21.670]  and filmed Mike smoking a joint
[37:21.670 --> 37:23.590]  and filmed Filthy Wade in his filthy mustache
[37:23.590 --> 37:24.750]  smoking a joint.
[37:24.750 --> 37:28.110]  They've got a scene that they like of me hitting a pipe.
[37:28.110 --> 37:30.390]  And then the scene of you hitting a dab,
[37:30.390 --> 37:31.630]  apparently they love.
[37:32.470 --> 37:34.870]  I used to run into that reporter at city council
[37:34.870 --> 37:36.510]  and she would bring it up at least
[37:36.510 --> 37:37.750]  three or four times a year.
[37:37.750 --> 37:39.550]  Yeah, unfortunately she moved away
[37:39.550 --> 37:41.670]  and got assigned to another area, but she was fun.
[37:41.670 --> 37:44.590]  Anytime she had it, I said headed.
[37:44.590 --> 37:48.350]  Anytime she had cannabis related questions,
[37:48.350 --> 37:49.170]  she would just call me.
[37:49.170 --> 37:50.630]  She's like, hey, I need to interview somebody about this.
[37:50.630 --> 37:51.870]  Who would you send me to?
[37:51.870 --> 37:53.750]  And half the time I'd be like, oh, that's a Mike thing.
[37:53.750 --> 37:54.830]  Just go straight to Mike.
[37:54.830 --> 37:56.470]  Don't even call me about these types of things.
[37:56.470 --> 37:57.310]  Here's Mike's number.
[37:57.310 --> 37:59.830]  And she would text me, hi, I've already talked,
[37:59.830 --> 38:01.150]  or I already texted Jeff.
[38:01.670 --> 38:02.990]  And he said, this is a you question.
[38:02.990 --> 38:03.830]  Yeah.
[38:03.830 --> 38:05.030]  And then she'd hit me with her question.
[38:05.030 --> 38:06.190]  Well, a lot of the political stuff,
[38:06.190 --> 38:08.030]  I just wave right over to Mike.
[38:08.030 --> 38:11.190]  So anyway, Michelle San Miguel comes here, we smoke.
[38:11.190 --> 38:13.430]  And then that ends up on the news.
[38:13.430 --> 38:16.310]  It is part of the ABC world news or something.
[38:16.310 --> 38:17.510]  They can play it.
[38:17.510 --> 38:18.550]  Yeah, they can play it whenever.
[38:18.550 --> 38:19.990]  It's been played in Australia.
[38:19.990 --> 38:20.830]  I don't know if it's ABC or NBC.
[38:20.830 --> 38:21.650]  I honestly don't care enough to.
[38:21.650 --> 38:24.110]  Yeah, but one of the major news organizations,
[38:24.110 --> 38:26.590]  they own it and they play it on their shit all the time
[38:26.590 --> 38:27.510]  when they talk about cannabis.
[38:27.510 --> 38:29.910]  So Mike and Wade and I are seen worldwide smoking.
[38:30.230 --> 38:31.110]  You're a B-roll now.
[38:31.110 --> 38:31.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:31.950 --> 38:35.470]  All right, but Wade and I talked about that a lot
[38:35.470 --> 38:38.590]  on the podcast, on the 719 the Blocks podcast.
[38:38.590 --> 38:40.790]  And that kinda, before Wade was like,
[38:40.790 --> 38:41.830]  nobody wants to hear about weed,
[38:41.830 --> 38:42.870]  nobody wants to hear about weed.
[38:42.870 --> 38:45.950]  But now that it was legal and it was revolutionizing,
[38:45.950 --> 38:47.830]  it was a revolutionary topic,
[38:47.830 --> 38:49.950]  I can dig myself out of holes pretty good.
[38:49.950 --> 38:51.150]  It was a huge topic.
[38:51.150 --> 38:52.850]  Wade would give me some space on the podcast
[38:52.850 --> 38:53.990]  to talk about it.
[38:53.990 --> 38:56.430]  And then he got bored with it.
[38:56.430 --> 38:57.750]  He didn't want me to talk about it as much.
[38:57.750 --> 39:00.390]  And then his relationship and I and the podcast,
[39:00.390 --> 39:02.630]  he kinda quit doing that podcast and it kinda fizzled
[39:02.630 --> 39:04.150]  and he moved to Kentucky.
[39:04.150 --> 39:06.070]  And then I started doing my own show.
[39:06.070 --> 39:08.430]  I was like, we had both shows at the same time
[39:08.430 --> 39:09.610]  and he didn't wanna do my segment.
[39:09.610 --> 39:11.510]  So I just started doing a whole weed show.
[39:11.510 --> 39:13.550]  And that's kinda how we came to the podcast.
[39:13.550 --> 39:15.150]  So without Wade, I don't know that I would be doing
[39:15.150 --> 39:16.070]  a cannabis podcast.
[39:16.070 --> 39:17.190]  I had talked about it.
[39:18.110 --> 39:20.090]  I think there was enough bad information
[39:20.090 --> 39:22.790]  and that was pissing you off at the time to the degree.
[39:22.790 --> 39:23.630]  That was one of the big things.
[39:23.630 --> 39:24.450]  That was one of the, yeah.
[39:24.450 --> 39:25.290]  That was one of the huge things with me too.
[39:25.850 --> 39:27.850]  You were outlining a book for a while.
[39:27.850 --> 39:30.050]  Yeah, and there was no chance of me putting out a book
[39:30.050 --> 39:32.370]  cause I've got ADD and it changes so much.
[39:32.370 --> 39:34.730]  I was getting ready to be like, dude, I'll help you.
[39:34.730 --> 39:36.210]  I'll ghost write that fucker.
[39:36.210 --> 39:37.690]  Like just tell me what to say.
[39:37.690 --> 39:39.650]  I would go to Spencer and Maddie's house all the time,
[39:39.650 --> 39:40.770]  the Garden of Weeden crew.
[39:40.770 --> 39:43.370]  And Spence, they would invite me over
[39:43.370 --> 39:44.550]  and then we'd get high as shit.
[39:44.550 --> 39:45.490]  And I didn't wanna go home
[39:45.490 --> 39:47.550]  cause I'd be here at home alone.
[39:47.550 --> 39:49.630]  And Maddie and Spence and the dogs were there,
[39:49.630 --> 39:50.470]  but Spence would get high
[39:50.470 --> 39:52.010]  and wanna go play with his plants.
[39:52.010 --> 39:53.330]  And Maddie would just be sitting there.
[39:53.330 --> 39:55.610]  Sometimes they'd have other people come over
[39:55.610 --> 39:58.130]  and this guy, Nick, kept coming over and asking me
[39:58.130 --> 39:59.130]  and Maddie apologized.
[39:59.130 --> 40:00.730]  She's like, I'm sorry he has so many questions.
[40:00.730 --> 40:01.850]  I was like, I like it.
[40:01.850 --> 40:03.010]  He's making my brain spin.
[40:03.010 --> 40:04.130]  He's making me think.
[40:04.130 --> 40:05.410]  And I love that about the podcast.
[40:05.410 --> 40:06.450]  It makes me a better grower,
[40:06.450 --> 40:07.810]  but Nick kept asking questions.
[40:07.810 --> 40:10.090]  And then Nick left and Travis came over
[40:10.090 --> 40:12.050]  and asked the same fucking questions.
[40:12.050 --> 40:13.450]  And Maddie's like, God, I'm so sorry.
[40:13.450 --> 40:14.810]  It's the same fucking question.
[40:14.810 --> 40:15.770]  I was like, you know what?
[40:15.770 --> 40:17.410]  I'm gonna start recording this.
[40:17.410 --> 40:19.250]  Like, and then I was like, no, wait, I'm really good.
[40:19.250 --> 40:20.570]  I was kind of a smart ass joke.
[40:20.570 --> 40:22.090]  I was like, I'm just gonna put my phone out
[40:22.090 --> 40:22.930]  and just record it.
[40:23.530 --> 40:24.370]  And then the next time somebody asked,
[40:24.370 --> 40:25.210]  I'm gonna hit play.
[40:25.210 --> 40:27.050]  But I was like, no, wait, I've got a podcast.
[40:27.050 --> 40:28.210]  Like, I can just go do a podcast.
[40:28.210 --> 40:30.090]  And that's kind of what a lot of what started it.
[40:30.090 --> 40:31.690]  So the book idea, and you're right,
[40:31.690 --> 40:33.570]  people pissing me off on the forums.
[40:33.570 --> 40:35.530]  I saw people telling people to use coffee grounds
[40:35.530 --> 40:36.490]  to fix nitrogen.
[40:36.490 --> 40:39.570]  We had a bunch of conversations of bad grow information.
[40:39.570 --> 40:41.770]  Then I'd bring up the bad dab information
[40:41.770 --> 40:43.730]  and concentrated information that was going on.
[40:43.730 --> 40:46.650]  And you were like, dude, we need to do something about this.
[40:46.650 --> 40:48.330]  Yeah, because I was ridiculous.
[40:48.330 --> 40:51.210]  We can't let the three people who were fronting
[40:51.210 --> 40:53.690]  for the entire community continue to do that shit
[40:53.690 --> 40:56.010]  with other voices alongside them.
[40:56.010 --> 40:57.050]  Absolutely.
[40:57.050 --> 40:59.930]  So that's sort of how this podcast started at number one
[40:59.930 --> 41:01.850]  and ended up to 300.
[41:01.850 --> 41:02.970]  I'm gonna drop in a clip that goes,
[41:02.970 --> 41:04.570]  this is Sparta right now.
[41:06.650 --> 41:08.330]  The accountability piece,
[41:10.530 --> 41:12.810]  when you told me how many downloads you got in February,
[41:12.810 --> 41:14.250]  I was like, shit.
[41:14.250 --> 41:16.170]  I was like, cool, I think I've done my last show
[41:16.170 --> 41:17.010]  for a minute.
[41:17.010 --> 41:19.890]  I kept refreshing that page over and over.
[41:19.890 --> 41:21.610]  I was like, is that real?
[41:21.610 --> 41:22.690]  That's a lot of zeros.
[41:22.690 --> 41:23.530]  Yeah.
[41:23.530 --> 41:24.370]  Yeah.
[41:24.370 --> 41:25.290]  That's awesome.
[41:25.290 --> 41:26.770]  I do other social media
[41:26.770 --> 41:30.370]  and some of what I do kicks you out viewer metric.
[41:30.370 --> 41:33.530]  And that's just, I never saw this show
[41:33.530 --> 41:34.730]  reaching that many people.
[41:34.730 --> 41:36.930]  I can't believe you stuck with it this long.
[41:39.930 --> 41:41.090]  When I first started, I was like,
[41:41.090 --> 41:42.570]  I'd like to get 100 episodes.
[41:42.570 --> 41:44.890]  And when I hit 100, I was like, well, that's easy.
[41:44.890 --> 41:46.130]  I'm just getting good at this.
[41:46.130 --> 41:47.570]  I felt comfortable now.
[41:47.570 --> 41:50.890]  I think around 75, I think 73, 63-ish,
[41:50.890 --> 41:53.690]  whichever the, there's a perpetual grow
[41:53.690 --> 41:55.090]  and there's a dry and cure episode.
[41:55.090 --> 41:55.930]  I was like, I'm fucking podcasting.
[41:55.930 --> 41:57.370]  It's in dry and cure 36.
[41:57.370 --> 41:58.490]  I've had to look it up so many times.
[41:58.490 --> 41:59.330]  Yeah, you're right.
[41:59.330 --> 42:00.170]  You're right.
[42:00.170 --> 42:01.450]  I was getting a rhythm then.
[42:01.450 --> 42:03.610]  And then when I got the new intro song
[42:03.610 --> 42:05.090]  and then I'm gonna write a name down
[42:05.090 --> 42:07.570]  just cause I have to give a shout out to somebody.
[42:07.570 --> 42:09.130]  I don't wanna interrupt what I'm saying.
[42:09.130 --> 42:12.290]  Even in those early ones, there's a lot of amazing shows.
[42:13.330 --> 42:15.850]  You know who made me a hugely better podcaster?
[42:15.890 --> 42:17.930]  You guys, if you're trying to start a podcast
[42:17.930 --> 42:19.290]  and this is really random,
[42:19.290 --> 42:20.490]  if you're trying to start a podcast,
[42:20.490 --> 42:21.890]  if you're trying to improve your podcast,
[42:21.890 --> 42:24.010]  if you wanna know more about podcasting,
[42:24.010 --> 42:26.730]  there is a guy named Cliff Ravenscraft.
[42:26.730 --> 42:28.330]  The podcast answer man.
[42:28.330 --> 42:30.690]  He is known as the podcast answer man.
[42:30.690 --> 42:32.850]  He's changed, he's rebranded himself.
[42:32.850 --> 42:34.490]  He used to make me listen to his shows
[42:34.490 --> 42:36.330]  when we were driving places far.
[42:36.330 --> 42:37.170]  Dude, that guy taught me.
[42:37.170 --> 42:39.490]  And I didn't get it the first two shows,
[42:39.490 --> 42:42.330]  but by the third one, I was like, oh, now I fucking get it.
[42:42.330 --> 42:44.050]  I can hear it in the podcast.
[42:44.050 --> 42:46.290]  Yeah, it made me a better podcaster.
[42:46.290 --> 42:47.530]  It made me a better producer.
[42:47.530 --> 42:50.890]  It made me a better social media manager.
[42:50.890 --> 42:53.250]  It improved, it just made me,
[42:53.250 --> 42:54.530]  the way that Cliff Ravenscraft thinks.
[42:54.530 --> 42:57.050]  This isn't the ad he told you you would hear later.
[42:57.050 --> 42:58.850]  Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:58.850 --> 43:00.250]  Go check out Cliff Ravenscraft, sorry.
[43:00.250 --> 43:02.410]  He just, he taught me a different way of thinking
[43:02.410 --> 43:04.530]  and different ways of approaching things and I like it.
[43:04.530 --> 43:06.510]  He just opens up your eyes and it's free.
[43:06.510 --> 43:07.650]  There's so much free content.
[43:07.650 --> 43:09.370]  He's got so much paid content.
[43:09.370 --> 43:10.810]  I've never paid for any of it.
[43:10.810 --> 43:11.650]  I've learned a ton.
[43:11.650 --> 43:14.050]  I can only imagine what I'd get from the paid content.
[43:14.050 --> 43:16.690]  But podcastanswerman.com,
[43:16.690 --> 43:19.450]  Cliff Ravenscraft is the podcast answer man.
[43:19.450 --> 43:21.730]  He'll teach you so much shit about podcasting.
[43:21.730 --> 43:24.690]  You'll see where I got a lot of my ideas and inspiration.
[43:24.690 --> 43:25.770]  I owe him a huge shout out.
[43:25.770 --> 43:27.370]  I don't know that he'll ever listen to this,
[43:27.370 --> 43:28.690]  but I've gotta mention him,
[43:28.690 --> 43:31.450]  because without that dude, this wouldn't be here.
[43:31.450 --> 43:34.110]  All right, gratitude, it's what I've got written down.
[43:34.110 --> 43:37.450]  The biggest word on my page is gratitude and nacho theory.
[43:37.450 --> 43:39.450]  The two biggest things.
[43:40.450 --> 43:41.290]  All right, you guys.
[43:41.290 --> 43:42.690]  That nacho theory scares me.
[43:42.690 --> 43:44.810]  My throat's dry, I'm gonna take a drink.
[43:44.810 --> 43:45.650]  One of you guys.
[43:45.650 --> 43:46.490]  It's about drinking dab time.
[43:46.490 --> 43:47.450]  Ramble, yeah, I was gonna say,
[43:47.450 --> 43:49.530]  let's ramble about something and then get some dabs going.
[43:49.530 --> 43:50.610]  We've been going for a little bit here.
[43:50.610 --> 43:51.610]  We can get silly again.
[43:51.610 --> 43:54.410]  It took us a minute to get back on earth.
[43:54.410 --> 43:57.590]  Do you have a favorite show you've been on, Kev?
[43:57.590 --> 43:59.630]  Or a favorite podcast moment?
[44:01.450 --> 44:06.090]  Man, I couldn't tell you at the moment.
[44:06.090 --> 44:09.210]  I asked, when we were talking about
[44:09.970 --> 44:10.810]  who was on the first episode,
[44:10.810 --> 44:12.650]  I got thinking about why I knew that offhand.
[44:12.650 --> 44:14.730]  And I recently went back and listened
[44:14.730 --> 44:16.130]  to a couple of throwbacks
[44:16.130 --> 44:18.010]  and just started with number one again.
[44:18.010 --> 44:19.250]  I kind of feel like a bag of dicks
[44:19.250 --> 44:21.210]  for not remembering that you weren't on number one.
[44:21.210 --> 44:22.890]  All right, I'm always here.
[44:22.890 --> 44:24.570]  If I've been on more episodes
[44:24.570 --> 44:26.130]  than any other guest by a mile.
[44:26.130 --> 44:27.610]  44 is preoccupied.
[44:28.650 --> 44:30.650]  I think I really liked the first one,
[44:30.650 --> 44:35.010]  because it was just, it was really just informational.
[44:35.010 --> 44:37.830]  There's one where you guys pretend to be excited
[44:37.830 --> 44:40.530]  about having been at the Cup,
[44:40.530 --> 44:43.030]  when the Cup was just a brutal experience.
[44:43.030 --> 44:44.990]  And there's a minute where you're like,
[44:44.990 --> 44:47.450]  so we're gonna talk about the Cup next week.
[44:47.450 --> 44:48.590]  And then it goes into the next show,
[44:48.590 --> 44:50.430]  and you're like, so we were at the Cup.
[44:55.310 --> 44:57.110]  Big events are challenging.
[44:57.110 --> 44:57.950]  Yeah, they are.
[44:57.950 --> 44:59.710]  It's fun, but it's, they are.
[44:59.710 --> 45:04.150]  There's, we've invented the way to do things
[45:04.150 --> 45:05.550]  so much in Colorado,
[45:05.550 --> 45:09.630]  but we haven't got the cannabis consumption friendly event
[45:09.630 --> 45:11.790]  down to an ABCD.
[45:11.790 --> 45:12.990]  No, we had it figured out.
[45:12.990 --> 45:14.070]  We fucked it all up.
[45:14.070 --> 45:16.110]  I think the first few events, we nailed it.
[45:16.110 --> 45:19.470]  And then we got legalities, excuse me, I'm burping.
[45:19.470 --> 45:22.270]  We got legalities involved, and it ruined everything.
[45:22.270 --> 45:24.230]  Yeah, but that has to happen at some point.
[45:24.230 --> 45:25.070]  Yeah.
[45:25.070 --> 45:26.150]  You can't throw a regular party
[45:26.150 --> 45:27.430]  for more than eight people without.
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.910]  My thing is, those events have,
[45:29.910 --> 45:30.950]  I don't know how many people went.
[45:30.950 --> 45:33.430]  Remember the Cannabis, the last Cannabis Cup at the X-Do,
[45:33.430 --> 45:34.470]  the small place?
[45:34.470 --> 45:35.310]  Yeah.
[45:35.310 --> 45:36.550]  Where that traffic jam of people happened,
[45:36.550 --> 45:38.190]  where you couldn't walk anywhere?
[45:38.190 --> 45:39.190]  You were just stuck.
[45:39.190 --> 45:40.950]  You were like physically stuck.
[45:40.950 --> 45:42.990]  Was that the one that got reamed
[45:42.990 --> 45:45.470]  because of the fucking huge mess the next year?
[45:45.470 --> 45:46.310]  Yes.
[45:46.310 --> 45:48.150]  That's exactly, yeah.
[45:48.150 --> 45:49.550]  Those events are challenging
[45:49.550 --> 45:52.590]  because you have to park three miles away.
[45:52.590 --> 45:54.950]  You gotta park and then walk with all of your gear.
[45:54.950 --> 45:56.870]  I've got, and I'm not trying to sound like a bitch,
[45:56.870 --> 45:58.470]  but you've got your product that you're,
[45:58.470 --> 46:00.550]  whatever you're vending, you've got your product.
[46:00.550 --> 46:01.790]  Then you've got your dab rig.
[46:01.790 --> 46:03.110]  You've got whatever else you're bringing.
[46:03.790 --> 46:05.350]  It's Colorado, so you've got a hat, sunglasses,
[46:05.350 --> 46:06.430]  a fucking jacket.
[46:07.350 --> 46:09.270]  You got layers of clothing because it's Colorado.
[46:09.270 --> 46:10.510]  You got a backpack.
[46:10.510 --> 46:13.550]  It's just challenging to get from the car to the thing.
[46:13.550 --> 46:14.670]  And then there's so many people,
[46:14.670 --> 46:16.390]  you gotta stand in line forever.
[46:16.390 --> 46:18.390]  Then the events are super crowded.
[46:18.390 --> 46:21.870]  And then it's challenging because Kevin and I
[46:21.870 --> 46:25.510]  have a different approach to the events than most consumers.
[46:25.510 --> 46:26.990]  We aren't your average consumer.
[46:26.990 --> 46:29.030]  We're there to see other industry folk.
[46:29.030 --> 46:32.430]  And consumers, this sounds egotistical
[46:32.430 --> 46:34.230]  and it's weird for me to even think about it this way,
[46:34.230 --> 46:37.030]  but consumers are there to see us a little bit.
[46:37.030 --> 46:39.030]  They wanna come talk to Ross to Jeff.
[46:39.030 --> 46:40.670]  And I love the social interaction,
[46:40.670 --> 46:43.950]  but after from fucking noon to eight at night,
[46:43.950 --> 46:45.350]  your voice starts to sound like this.
[46:45.350 --> 46:46.430]  And you're like, will you shut up?
[46:46.430 --> 46:49.230]  Cause I wanna check my text messages and eat a sandwich.
[46:49.230 --> 46:52.990]  And then they throw a big concert or whatever
[46:52.990 --> 46:55.510]  that never sounds worth a shit.
[46:55.510 --> 46:57.230]  And never ends.
[46:57.230 --> 46:59.470]  Never ends, it doesn't.
[46:59.470 --> 47:02.030]  Every time I see a cannabis themed concert
[47:02.630 --> 47:04.870]  I'm a fan of some of the bands that always do them,
[47:04.870 --> 47:06.790]  but I see the line of it.
[47:06.790 --> 47:08.750]  I'm like, the fuck, why?
[47:08.750 --> 47:11.950]  And these mid nineties hip hop bands most of the time.
[47:11.950 --> 47:13.630]  It's already 420.
[47:13.630 --> 47:16.070]  Can't we just have some good music?
[47:16.070 --> 47:17.510]  They're getting better.
[47:17.510 --> 47:18.350]  They are getting better.
[47:18.350 --> 47:19.190]  It's not like St. Paddy's Day
[47:19.190 --> 47:20.910]  where everything needs to be green.
[47:20.910 --> 47:22.350]  In years, dude.
[47:22.350 --> 47:24.110]  I haven't been to any of them.
[47:24.110 --> 47:25.830]  They're getting bigger name, better acts now.
[47:25.830 --> 47:28.790]  And there's another event that's actually booking
[47:28.790 --> 47:30.910]  top acts that are current right now.
[47:30.910 --> 47:33.150]  Shout out to our friends at the Chalice Festival.
[47:33.150 --> 47:34.570]  They don't pay me to say any of that,
[47:34.570 --> 47:37.870]  but Chalice is revolutionizing cannabis festivals.
[47:37.870 --> 47:38.710]  Chalice is doing it right.
[47:38.710 --> 47:39.590]  Shout out to Dougie.
[47:39.590 --> 47:40.950]  Dougie's doing everything right.
[47:40.950 --> 47:43.550]  I don't care if you love or hate Hitman Glass.
[47:43.550 --> 47:45.510]  I think that Dougie does shit well.
[47:45.510 --> 47:47.110]  Like Dougie's a good businessman.
[47:47.110 --> 47:48.190]  Love him or fucking hate him.
[47:48.190 --> 47:49.790]  He's killing it.
[47:49.790 --> 47:50.630]  He's doing it.
[47:50.630 --> 47:51.990]  What are you doing?
[47:51.990 --> 47:54.390]  Like, take a hit man.
[47:54.390 --> 47:55.230]  That's perfect.
[47:55.230 --> 47:59.070]  I got a dab right here of this Gorilla Glue number four.
[47:59.070 --> 47:59.910]  The Ambrosia.
[47:59.910 --> 48:01.510]  You're smoking one of the islands, huh?
[48:01.510 --> 48:02.350]  Yeah.
[48:04.910 --> 48:07.230]  It's just so gorgeous, folks.
[48:07.230 --> 48:09.510]  Yeah, I wish I could take some pictures of it,
[48:09.510 --> 48:11.390]  but I'm gonna just smoke it.
[48:11.390 --> 48:12.830]  Like, it's probably the weed talking,
[48:12.830 --> 48:14.430]  but you know in the movie where they do like
[48:14.430 --> 48:16.470]  the cool 3D map of the fucking island
[48:16.470 --> 48:18.010]  that they're gonna go to?
[48:18.010 --> 48:19.990]  That's kind of what it looks like in the jar.
[48:19.990 --> 48:23.070]  Like, there's this beautiful sea of fucking turps,
[48:23.070 --> 48:24.990]  and then there's just these fucking gorgeous
[48:24.990 --> 48:26.470]  little island chain of rocks.
[48:26.470 --> 48:28.150]  Icebergs?
[48:28.150 --> 48:28.990]  Icebergs, sure.
[48:29.110 --> 48:30.110]  Little icebergs in there?
[48:30.110 --> 48:30.950]  You see, I was thinking more like-
[48:30.950 --> 48:33.190]  Is there about to wreck your ship?
[48:33.190 --> 48:34.950]  I was thinking more like full of life
[48:34.950 --> 48:38.630]  rather than sink your ship, but both are actually-
[48:38.630 --> 48:40.790]  It's a little bit of both, yeah, the way I do it.
[48:40.790 --> 48:43.790]  Yeah, and they're more ice than green.
[48:46.830 --> 48:48.910]  Would you also describe these as piss yellow?
[48:48.910 --> 48:49.750]  Well, when you said-
[48:49.750 --> 48:51.710]  I'm trying to avoid that, Mike, thanks.
[48:51.710 --> 48:55.870]  When you said ice, I get so nervous around people
[48:55.870 --> 48:56.790]  that don't know what dabs are,
[48:56.830 --> 48:59.150]  because they gotta be like, what is he fucking doing?
[48:59.150 --> 49:01.070]  If you wanna hit this on camera
[49:01.070 --> 49:03.710]  or in non-heavy consumption company,
[49:03.710 --> 49:07.110]  you really need a hat with giant, bold, white lettering on it
[49:07.110 --> 49:08.470]  that says, this isn't crack.
[49:08.470 --> 49:09.950]  Mike, can you tell them about Patreon
[49:09.950 --> 49:10.790]  while I take a dab?
[49:10.790 --> 49:11.610]  Are you capable?
[49:11.610 --> 49:13.630]  Jeff has a Patreon account, you should hit it up.
[49:13.630 --> 49:15.630]  Oh, that was good, tell them what it is.
[49:15.630 --> 49:17.750]  Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[49:17.750 --> 49:18.590]  Tell them what Patreon is.
[49:18.590 --> 49:20.350]  Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart
[49:20.350 --> 49:23.950]  is a way for the listeners to help contribute to the show.
[49:23.950 --> 49:26.590]  You can contribute any amount of money
[49:26.590 --> 49:27.430]  to the show that you like,
[49:27.430 --> 49:29.570]  from a penny to a lot of pennies.
[49:30.590 --> 49:33.270]  We encourage people to donate $4.20
[49:33.270 --> 49:36.430]  to any cannabis-related anything,
[49:36.430 --> 49:39.590]  just to let them know which community you're coming from.
[49:39.590 --> 49:41.870]  But if you wanted to help cover some of the costs
[49:41.870 --> 49:43.590]  and expenses of the show,
[49:43.590 --> 49:46.350]  and we're not talking about the hash,
[49:46.350 --> 49:47.830]  we're talking about microphone covers
[49:47.830 --> 49:49.710]  and earphone cables and that kind of stuff,
[49:49.710 --> 49:52.030]  you can hop on Patreon and help Jeff out.
[49:52.030 --> 49:53.830]  Yeah, he's trying to save up for a MacBook, people,
[49:54.710 --> 49:56.990]  so that's a whole lot of Patreon contributions.
[49:56.990 --> 49:59.510]  But the Patreon community's been killing it.
[49:59.510 --> 50:03.670]  The community's just been absolutely wonderful lately.
[50:03.670 --> 50:07.510]  So keep the love coming, and we thank you very, very much.
[50:07.510 --> 50:09.310]  That was good, Mike, that was pretty good for ad-limited.
[50:09.310 --> 50:10.150]  Guys, if you go to Patreon.com.
[50:10.150 --> 50:11.230]  Yeah, that was on the fucking spot.
[50:11.230 --> 50:12.510]  I've never done an ad before.
[50:12.510 --> 50:13.350]  Yeah, you nailed it.
[50:13.350 --> 50:14.190]  That's why I just did you right on the spot like that.
[50:14.190 --> 50:15.790]  I'm gonna take a dab now, I'm all stressed.
[50:15.790 --> 50:17.230]  Ah, I'm all stressed.
[50:17.230 --> 50:20.510]  You guys, if you go to Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart,
[50:20.510 --> 50:21.790]  I've made promises, excuse me,
[50:21.790 --> 50:23.590]  I've swallowed and said I've made promises
[50:24.350 --> 50:25.190]  at the same time.
[50:25.190 --> 50:26.030]  I've made promises.
[50:26.030 --> 50:27.430]  If you contribute certain amounts,
[50:27.430 --> 50:29.430]  I have promised to do certain things for you.
[50:29.430 --> 50:30.270]  Go check that out.
[50:30.270 --> 50:32.190]  Also, I've made specific goals.
[50:32.190 --> 50:34.550]  I'm not just begging for money with no goal.
[50:34.550 --> 50:35.550]  I put it up there clearly
[50:35.550 --> 50:36.950]  what I'm gonna do with the finances.
[50:36.950 --> 50:39.430]  So if you'd like to help out, I would appreciate it.
[50:39.430 --> 50:40.270]  Oh, growfromyourheart.com.
[50:40.270 --> 50:41.110]  I just got a dabbers artist.
[50:41.110 --> 50:43.190]  Yeah, I got you a dab, Mike.
[50:43.190 --> 50:44.510]  You got me like four dabs.
[50:44.510 --> 50:46.110]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart
[50:46.110 --> 50:47.390]  is what I was trying to say, you guys.
[50:47.390 --> 50:48.310]  Thanks for the love and support.
[50:48.310 --> 50:49.790]  Thanks to everybody who's helped me out.
[50:49.790 --> 50:52.230]  You guys, if you can't contribute to Patreon,
[50:52.230 --> 50:53.390]  please listen to the podcast.
[50:54.190 --> 50:55.030]  It's free for a reason.
[50:55.030 --> 50:56.430]  Some people can contribute.
[50:56.430 --> 50:57.270]  Thank you.
[50:57.270 --> 50:58.630]  If you can't, just keep listening.
[50:58.630 --> 51:00.230]  Your listens mean the world to me.
[51:00.230 --> 51:01.230]  You're supporting cannabis.
[51:01.230 --> 51:03.390]  You're supporting cannabis legalization.
[51:03.390 --> 51:04.590]  That's right.
[51:04.590 --> 51:05.870]  You're supporting our efforts.
[51:05.870 --> 51:08.030]  If you can't contribute and you want us to support us
[51:08.030 --> 51:10.030]  more than just listening, tell a friend.
[51:11.270 --> 51:12.630]  Or 17.
[51:12.630 --> 51:13.510]  Tell all your friends.
[51:13.510 --> 51:15.070]  Just blab about the show.
[51:15.070 --> 51:16.190]  Retweet it, share it.
[51:16.190 --> 51:18.190]  All right, you guys, I'm off on a ramble now.
[51:19.070 --> 51:20.630]  I just took a big old dab of some Gorilla Glue.
[51:20.630 --> 51:23.270]  I'm just so impressed with where the show's gone, man.
[51:24.150 --> 51:25.390]  Heat kinda at the bottom of the nail a little better?
[51:25.390 --> 51:26.230]  Yeah.
[51:26.230 --> 51:27.070]  Heat at the bottom of the nail.
[51:27.070 --> 51:28.750]  Where the floor meets the wall.
[51:28.750 --> 51:29.590]  Right in that corner.
[51:29.590 --> 51:30.430]  There you go.
[51:30.430 --> 51:32.670]  I was just trying to clean off a layer of soap, brother.
[51:32.670 --> 51:33.590]  It's gonna taste good.
[51:33.590 --> 51:34.430]  That's Skywise.
[51:34.430 --> 51:35.750]  What did I give you?
[51:35.750 --> 51:37.230]  That is the taffy.
[51:37.230 --> 51:40.810]  So it's the LA Afi and the tangy, I think.
[51:43.190 --> 51:44.990]  I just dabbed the Gorilla Glue number four.
[51:44.990 --> 51:46.190]  Part of it came out of my nose.
[51:46.190 --> 51:47.110]  Uh-oh.
[51:47.110 --> 51:50.350]  Yeah, it kinda burns, but I feel like I get so high
[51:50.350 --> 51:51.790]  when it comes out of my nose.
[51:52.710 --> 51:53.550]  Cause it burns.
[51:53.550 --> 51:54.390]  Cause it burns.
[51:55.350 --> 51:56.750]  There's something good and bad about it.
[51:56.750 --> 51:57.670]  It does burn.
[51:58.670 --> 52:00.630]  All right, this would be a good time to read that ad
[52:00.630 --> 52:02.030]  I was talking about, cause it feels like we've got
[52:02.030 --> 52:03.750]  some dead space in the show.
[52:03.750 --> 52:05.430]  Sorry about all the coughing.
[52:05.430 --> 52:06.510]  Oh, should I just turn down your mic?
[52:06.510 --> 52:07.990]  Do you remember what number you are?
[52:07.990 --> 52:08.830]  Three.
[52:09.630 --> 52:10.870]  All right, mic is turned down.
[52:10.870 --> 52:13.310]  Kev, you're still live, so don't say anything too dumb.
[52:13.310 --> 52:14.350]  I'll try not to.
[52:14.350 --> 52:15.830]  You never know with this kid.
[52:15.830 --> 52:16.950]  All right, check this out, you guys.
[52:16.950 --> 52:18.410]  This podcast is proudly brought to you
[52:18.410 --> 52:20.550]  by our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[52:20.590 --> 52:22.790]  PL Grow Systems, putting you in control.
[52:22.790 --> 52:24.310]  Check out this read they gave me, you guys.
[52:24.310 --> 52:25.670]  I fucking love this.
[52:25.670 --> 52:26.590]  They know their audience.
[52:26.590 --> 52:27.790]  They know who I am.
[52:27.790 --> 52:28.670]  They wrote this, okay?
[52:28.670 --> 52:30.630]  This is straight up from them.
[52:30.630 --> 52:32.470]  You've just taken a nice fat dab,
[52:32.470 --> 52:34.790]  and you get that burning desire to check on your grow room,
[52:34.790 --> 52:36.350]  but you're too stoned to move.
[52:36.350 --> 52:38.630]  PNL Grow Systems, the minder, lets you check
[52:38.630 --> 52:41.230]  on your grow room environment from right there on the couch.
[52:41.230 --> 52:44.510]  Simply log in and get the information you need.
[52:44.510 --> 52:46.510]  And that's no exaggeration, you guys.
[52:46.510 --> 52:49.550]  PL Grow Systems sent me a unit to set up.
[52:49.550 --> 52:51.150]  Their website is great.
[52:51.150 --> 52:53.070]  You open this package, you go to their website,
[52:53.070 --> 52:54.950]  you sign up, you create an account,
[52:54.950 --> 52:56.270]  you register your device,
[52:56.270 --> 52:58.630]  you put your device in the grow room,
[52:58.630 --> 53:01.130]  and it will tell you live readings of your temperature
[53:01.130 --> 53:04.230]  and humidity and more, and you can log in anywhere.
[53:04.230 --> 53:05.470]  There are other devices like this.
[53:05.470 --> 53:06.710]  I'm not gonna bash other products.
[53:06.710 --> 53:08.910]  There are other devices like this that I've talked about
[53:08.910 --> 53:11.110]  that I've used, and they're great,
[53:11.110 --> 53:13.750]  but you can't log in from anywhere and view them.
[53:13.750 --> 53:15.390]  With the PL Grow Systems unit,
[53:15.390 --> 53:17.950]  I can be over at Kev's house dabbing on the couch.
[53:17.950 --> 53:19.910]  I can be up at Liberty Point eating lunch,
[53:19.910 --> 53:21.550]  and I can log in and I can see what's going on
[53:21.550 --> 53:25.310]  in my grow in real time, which for a guy with OCD like me,
[53:25.310 --> 53:27.350]  for a guy that loves his garden like me,
[53:27.350 --> 53:28.190]  it's really helpful.
[53:28.190 --> 53:31.310]  So I think their ad is great because it's accurate.
[53:31.310 --> 53:33.030]  How many times Mike's getting up to just leave?
[53:33.030 --> 53:35.510]  Mike's like, fuck this, I'm so high, I'm going home.
[53:35.510 --> 53:37.590]  How many times have you been somewhere
[53:37.590 --> 53:39.310]  and you're like, I kinda wanna hang out?
[53:39.310 --> 53:40.550]  Okay, let's get real.
[53:40.550 --> 53:41.830]  How many times have you been hanging out
[53:41.830 --> 53:43.810]  with a fine ass girl?
[53:43.810 --> 53:45.110]  She's fucking beautiful.
[53:45.110 --> 53:48.430]  And you're like, oh, tonight might be the goddamn night.
[53:48.430 --> 53:50.430]  And then you can look at the temps and the humidity,
[53:50.430 --> 53:52.710]  and you can make sure everything's cool in there.
[53:52.710 --> 53:55.790]  Check the moisture sensor, make sure the plants are moist.
[53:57.430 --> 53:58.270]  And if everything's cool,
[53:58.270 --> 53:59.870]  you can probably hang out for a little longer.
[53:59.870 --> 54:01.850]  Then you can relax and enjoy yourself.
[54:01.850 --> 54:04.430]  But if you don't have a PL Grow System unit,
[54:04.430 --> 54:05.630]  you can't fucking log in and check it out.
[54:05.630 --> 54:07.150]  You're gonna have to go home.
[54:07.150 --> 54:08.190]  It's gonna be freaking out.
[54:08.190 --> 54:10.190]  The only thing getting wet tonight are the plants.
[54:10.190 --> 54:12.850]  That's a good fucking ad.
[54:15.110 --> 54:17.390]  Shout out to our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[54:17.390 --> 54:19.870]  I support them, they support me.
[54:19.870 --> 54:20.990]  You should support them as well.
[54:20.990 --> 54:21.830]  Thank you guys for the support.
[54:21.830 --> 54:24.190]  I won't do any more ads in this episode, you guys.
[54:24.190 --> 54:25.190]  That is it.
[54:25.190 --> 54:27.590]  But make sure you check out PL Grow Systems.
[54:27.590 --> 54:28.710]  I have their website right here.
[54:28.710 --> 54:30.590]  I'm trying to get my iPad to light up.
[54:32.230 --> 54:34.390]  But it was really far away, so I had to reach for it.
[54:34.390 --> 54:37.710]  And their website is PLGrow.Systems.
[54:37.710 --> 54:38.550]  Check them out.
[54:38.550 --> 54:40.750]  Let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you, please.
[54:40.750 --> 54:42.710]  All right, no more ads, guys, I promise.
[54:44.070 --> 54:44.910]  I promise.
[54:45.710 --> 54:46.870]  Dude, two's not bad.
[54:46.870 --> 54:47.790]  Two's not bad.
[54:47.790 --> 54:48.630]  And they're fun ads.
[54:48.630 --> 54:51.750]  I watch YouTube videos all the time,
[54:51.750 --> 54:53.470]  and you can't get through five minutes
[54:53.470 --> 54:55.610]  without getting an ad.
[54:55.610 --> 54:57.170]  It's kind of retarded.
[54:58.110 --> 55:00.070]  YouTube kind of decides where they throw the ads at you,
[55:00.070 --> 55:00.910]  I think.
[55:00.910 --> 55:01.910]  I know, but it's all the time.
[55:01.910 --> 55:03.230]  Yeah, it's frustrating.
[55:03.230 --> 55:05.710]  What I hate, though, is I watch fish videos at work,
[55:05.710 --> 55:07.790]  because I'll just put on YouTube and go type in fish,
[55:07.790 --> 55:09.350]  and then just let it play fish.
[55:09.350 --> 55:11.710]  And dude, fish plays 15-minute songs,
[55:11.710 --> 55:14.630]  and about eight minutes is where you get like, yeah!
[55:15.310 --> 55:17.510]  You'd be like, bing, wee, wah!
[55:17.510 --> 55:19.910]  This episode, and you're like, what just happened?
[55:19.910 --> 55:21.310]  It's like a Tide commercial.
[55:21.310 --> 55:23.830]  With new Tide pods, you're like, no, fuck your Tide pods,
[55:23.830 --> 55:24.790]  get out of here.
[55:24.790 --> 55:25.630]  Happens a lot.
[55:25.630 --> 55:27.730]  Or they play on the Reggae channel,
[55:27.730 --> 55:29.310]  they put McDonald's commercials.
[55:29.310 --> 55:31.270]  And I'm like, that's poorly aimed.
[55:31.270 --> 55:32.830]  Rastas aren't gonna go eat McDonald's.
[55:32.830 --> 55:34.270]  It's highly unlikely.
[55:34.270 --> 55:35.870]  You should've put a Vitamin Cottage
[55:35.870 --> 55:37.590]  or a Sprouts commercial on here or something.
[55:37.590 --> 55:38.590]  You might've got me.
[55:40.350 --> 55:41.710]  Whoever pays, man.
[55:41.710 --> 55:42.550]  That's the truth.
[55:42.550 --> 55:44.630]  Well, I guess you're right.
[55:44.630 --> 55:45.470]  Oh.
[55:47.750 --> 55:48.590]  Mike's back, you okay, bro?
[55:48.590 --> 55:50.030]  What did I walk back into?
[55:51.790 --> 55:52.950]  Just a podcast, bro.
[55:52.950 --> 55:53.850]  How was your day?
[55:55.070 --> 55:56.190]  Getting better every minute.
[55:56.190 --> 55:57.430]  Nice, that's the right approach.
[55:57.430 --> 55:58.410]  Did everybody get a good dab?
[55:58.410 --> 56:01.510]  Mine came out of my nose and I can still feel it.
[56:01.510 --> 56:02.510]  Still coughing.
[56:02.510 --> 56:03.350]  Perfect.
[56:03.350 --> 56:04.190]  Kev, did you get snowed over there?
[56:04.190 --> 56:05.630]  I haven't gotten another dab yet.
[56:05.630 --> 56:07.510]  That's just because I've just been chilling.
[56:07.510 --> 56:08.830]  Do you need a dab of Skywalker,
[56:08.830 --> 56:10.310]  or are you just being patient over there?
[56:10.310 --> 56:11.270]  I'm just being patient, man.
[56:11.310 --> 56:13.310]  I'll give you a Skywalker dab if you're-
[56:13.310 --> 56:15.710]  Sure, I'll take a Skywalker dab.
[56:15.710 --> 56:17.630]  I couldn't really decide what I was gonna dab.
[56:17.630 --> 56:19.630]  Isn't that the hardest part of life sometimes?
[56:19.630 --> 56:21.110]  Not in a hurry, so.
[56:21.110 --> 56:22.430]  First world problems.
[56:22.430 --> 56:23.710]  That Colorado problem.
[56:24.550 --> 56:25.630]  Well, this one's gonna be a combo,
[56:25.630 --> 56:27.710]  because we finished off this Skywalker.
[56:27.710 --> 56:29.470]  You're gonna get a Skywalker taffy.
[56:29.470 --> 56:30.310]  Uh-oh.
[56:30.310 --> 56:31.190]  A scaffy dab.
[56:31.190 --> 56:32.630]  Scaffy?
[56:32.630 --> 56:33.990]  Sounds worse than it is.
[56:36.190 --> 56:37.550]  Sounds like jealousy to me.
[56:38.550 --> 56:39.630]  Mike, you want another big dab?
[56:39.630 --> 56:40.470]  I'll give you one, bro.
[56:40.470 --> 56:41.310]  You ready?
[56:41.310 --> 56:42.150]  Step up.
[56:42.150 --> 56:42.990]  No.
[56:42.990 --> 56:43.830]  Need a minute.
[56:43.830 --> 56:44.670]  Lungs are still fluttering.
[56:44.670 --> 56:46.990]  Yeah, you're still sweating, like actively.
[56:48.710 --> 56:50.750]  I'm sweating, and I haven't even dabbed yet.
[56:50.750 --> 56:51.590]  He's just thinking about it.
[56:51.590 --> 56:52.430]  He's sweating.
[56:52.430 --> 56:53.350]  I think that's drool.
[56:53.350 --> 56:55.910]  I'm just like, oh shit, I'm gonna dab.
[56:55.910 --> 56:56.950]  I think that's drool, Kev.
[56:56.950 --> 56:59.710]  You're just drooling for the coming dab.
[56:59.710 --> 57:02.830]  All right, that's a little taffy, a little Skywalker.
[57:02.830 --> 57:04.070]  You got you a torch.
[57:04.070 --> 57:05.670]  You got a real pretty rig.
[57:05.670 --> 57:08.670]  Shout out to our friend Camp Bowls Glass with the dope rig.
[57:09.670 --> 57:11.670]  Yeah, pretty nice.
[57:12.670 --> 57:14.870]  I really like the banger.
[57:14.870 --> 57:17.510]  It's like three times as thick as anything I've owned.
[57:17.510 --> 57:18.990]  It's just the super thick version.
[57:18.990 --> 57:20.870]  If you go to the store and see the super thick one,
[57:20.870 --> 57:21.950]  that's the one Kev's got.
[57:21.950 --> 57:23.150]  Yeah, they just had the regular one
[57:23.150 --> 57:25.030]  the last two times I was shopping, I guess.
[57:25.030 --> 57:26.990]  Yeah, it's rare to find these.
[57:26.990 --> 57:28.070]  Get yourself a bubble cap.
[57:28.070 --> 57:29.830]  That's what I think.
[57:29.830 --> 57:33.070]  People have been digging on the Core Reactor banger.
[57:33.070 --> 57:35.790]  It doesn't, it's not hot enough for me.
[57:35.790 --> 57:37.710]  I take too big of a dab for it, I feel like.
[57:37.750 --> 57:39.110]  And I know people are gonna say that's bullshit,
[57:39.110 --> 57:40.990]  but I want my dabs hot.
[57:40.990 --> 57:42.070]  It's for cool dabs.
[57:42.070 --> 57:44.310]  It's not designed for a hot dab.
[57:44.310 --> 57:45.710]  I do cool dabs, so.
[57:45.710 --> 57:47.190]  Yeah.
[57:47.190 --> 57:50.750]  It looks like it's for cool dabs in a large supply of-
[57:50.750 --> 57:51.790]  A lot of butane.
[57:51.790 --> 57:53.070]  You're supposed to heat this bottom part
[57:53.070 --> 57:55.310]  to keep that big piece in there hot.
[57:55.310 --> 57:57.310]  But as soon as your dab hits it,
[57:57.310 --> 57:59.310]  it really cools it off super quickly
[57:59.310 --> 58:00.910]  when you put a puddle in there.
[58:02.030 --> 58:04.230]  I put a big, big, big dabs lately.
[58:04.230 --> 58:05.070]  I don't know why.
[58:05.070 --> 58:07.270]  My dab size has just been increasing lately.
[58:07.990 --> 58:09.430]  So Kev's over there heating the nail
[58:09.430 --> 58:11.470]  until it's going to reshape itself, I think.
[58:11.470 --> 58:12.310]  Yeah, I am.
[58:12.310 --> 58:13.150]  You good, bro?
[58:13.150 --> 58:14.110]  I'm just cleaning it.
[58:14.110 --> 58:15.230]  All right.
[58:15.230 --> 58:16.710]  Burning off that muck.
[58:16.710 --> 58:19.070]  Yeah, gotta do that every now and then.
[58:19.070 --> 58:20.790]  Give it a good clean.
[58:20.790 --> 58:22.230]  Make that turp taste good.
[58:23.430 --> 58:25.350]  Well, then you let it cool down.
[58:25.350 --> 58:27.150]  No, go in right now, hot and hurty.
[58:28.110 --> 58:29.950]  No, I'm good.
[58:29.950 --> 58:31.350]  Jeez.
[58:31.350 --> 58:33.110]  Oh, burn.
[58:33.110 --> 58:34.910]  Three, two, one, red means go.
[58:34.910 --> 58:35.790]  Red means go.
[58:35.790 --> 58:36.950]  Red means go.
[58:36.950 --> 58:38.870]  Red never means go.
[58:38.870 --> 58:39.710]  Mike, you asked Kevin
[58:39.710 --> 58:41.990]  what his favorite moment on the podcast was.
[58:41.990 --> 58:44.550]  Do you have any favorite moments of the podcast?
[58:44.550 --> 58:47.150]  Episode 100 is a serious standout.
[58:47.150 --> 58:47.990]  Okay.
[58:47.990 --> 58:49.150]  Wow, who was here for that one?
[58:49.150 --> 58:51.110]  Was that Gardner Whedon and yourself?
[58:51.110 --> 58:51.950]  Everybody that you could get here.
[58:51.950 --> 58:52.790]  Okay.
[58:52.790 --> 58:55.070]  This place was packed.
[58:55.070 --> 58:57.070]  Yeah, Sloppy and Joe were,
[58:57.070 --> 58:59.030]  Sloppy Joe were sitting over there in the corner.
[58:59.030 --> 58:59.990]  Dry dabbing.
[58:59.990 --> 59:00.830]  Dry dabbing.
[59:00.830 --> 59:02.750]  They took a dab out of the email with no water in it.
[59:02.750 --> 59:04.550]  And Sloppy's like, you trying to kill me?
[59:04.550 --> 59:05.510]  Shout out to Sloppy.
[59:05.510 --> 59:06.910]  Holy shit.
[59:07.910 --> 59:08.750]  Sloppy went from,
[59:08.750 --> 59:11.230]  I remember when Sloppy used to rap in the basement
[59:11.230 --> 59:13.470]  at the Gardner Whedon house,
[59:13.470 --> 59:15.070]  in the Gardner Whedon getting weeded.
[59:15.070 --> 59:18.590]  And now Sloppy is legit on tour with ICP.
[59:18.590 --> 59:20.350]  Like Sloppy came a long way.
[59:20.350 --> 59:21.190]  Yeah.
[59:21.190 --> 59:22.030]  Yeah.
[59:22.030 --> 59:23.790]  Slop's on tour with ICP.
[59:23.790 --> 59:28.790]  Like go check out Shampoo Sloppy or something similar.
[59:29.030 --> 59:32.990]  Sloppy 919, Dead God.
[59:32.990 --> 59:35.710]  That's all Sloppy's brand and stuff.
[59:35.710 --> 59:38.070]  Sorry guys, I can't keep up.
[59:38.070 --> 59:39.350]  I'm gonna sound like an old guy right now,
[59:39.350 --> 59:41.790]  but the youngsters change their names and their handles
[59:41.790 --> 59:43.590]  and their rap names so quickly that.
[59:43.590 --> 59:45.670]  We had to pick one and own it.
[59:45.670 --> 59:49.270]  Well, I think he's a youngster and it's been an evolution.
[59:49.270 --> 59:51.830]  We've got to watch him evolve from one version of Slop
[59:51.830 --> 59:53.470]  to the next, to what he's become now,
[59:53.470 --> 59:56.150]  which has been a blessing to watch one of your friends
[59:56.150 --> 59:59.550]  go from rapping in the basement at Spence and Maddie's.
[59:59.550 --> 01:00:00.710]  I remember when Maddie was like,
[01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.430]  my buddy Sloppy's moving out here in a little while.
[01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:03.270]  You're gonna like him.
[01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.470]  You guys will get along.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.350]  And then Sloppy came and I was like,
[01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:06.390]  this guy's fucking cool.
[01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:08.270]  Like I totally get along with Sloppy.
[01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.870]  Like he's down to shit.
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.150]  And then he's like, I'm a rapper.
[01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.670]  And I was like, everybody's a rapper.
[01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:14.270]  And then he started rapping and putting out beats.
[01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:15.470]  And I was like, that dude's got it going on.
[01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:17.310]  He can actually do some shit.
[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.470]  And then he tried this new thing.
[01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.910]  And then I was like, ah, it's coming together.
[01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.310]  And then he started putting out videos
[01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:22.670]  and I was like, it's coming even more together.
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:23.710]  And then one day he's like, guess what?
[01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.630]  Dog going on tour with ICP and all these other names
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:27.470]  that I don't know.
[01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.670]  But I mean, I recognize ICP and I was like,
[01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.030]  you're doing something, bro.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.110]  He's got a guy in his crew that wears a giant foot
[01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.830]  or giant toe costume that's getting real famous also.
[01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:38.670]  Really?
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.350]  Shout out to Slop.
[01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.190]  Fuck, you just made me feel old.
[01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.030]  Yeah, we are old, Mike.
[01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:48.990]  At the same time, I'm essentially smoking future weed.
[01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:51.990]  It's a weird dichotomy here in Colorado.
[01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:53.950]  It's a great time to be alive.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.150]  One of our buddies, Rob, was like,
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.030]  are you smoking those weird crystals?
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.910]  I was like, I sure as shit am, Rob.
[01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.750]  Fuck yeah.
[01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.590]  Fuck yeah, we are, bro.
[01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.550]  That's on deck for the night.
[01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:06.030]  The crystals are, it's a different high.
[01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.630]  It's like 90 something percent THC
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.190]  and it really hits you quickly.
[01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.070]  Can mess up a good podcast real fast.
[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.790]  I haven't soured diesel in a while.
[01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:16.670]  And this is a new gram, honestly,
[01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:18.630]  so I'm not super familiar with the ride
[01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.790]  on this particular gram.
[01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.230]  So I can't say how much is which,
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.150]  but I feel like we need a project.
[01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.390]  Mike smoked himself into a do something mode.
[01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:31.190]  Yeah, it's like, oh, we should do something.
[01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.150]  And then I looked down, I'm like,
[01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.950]  you're talking into a microphone right now, homie.
[01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.270]  Take some of that to work tomorrow, bro.
[01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.670]  You're making something done finally.
[01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:37.510]  Oh.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:38.350]  Ba-dum-kiss.
[01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:42.990]  Whoever that was, that was a good dab.
[01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:44.350]  You're fucking sweaty, bro.
[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.190]  What was that?
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:46.950]  That was the Skywalker leftovers
[01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.350]  and the taffy on top of it.
[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.190]  That was good.
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.310]  Yeah, it's the batter.
[01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:52.750]  Garden of Weden made that also.
[01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.750]  So shout out to the crew at the Garden of Weden.
[01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:55.590]  Oh, all right.
[01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:56.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.230]  Oh yeah, it's the beads of sweat
[01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.550]  just gathered up under your forehead.
[01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.470]  Okay, I'll be all right, don't worry.
[01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:04.670]  If you guys need more bottles of water, let me know.
[01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.830]  I've got a backup over here.
[01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:07.870]  If anybody needs anything, just raise your hand.
[01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:08.710]  I'll help you out.
[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.030]  It's that kind of show.
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.510]  Yeah, it's a two water bottle kind of show.
[01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.270]  We can do that occasionally.
[01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.750]  Mike covered Patreon, so that's fun.
[01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.230]  I covered the other ad that I talked about.
[01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.070]  I'm sorry about that, yo.
[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.910]  It was good.
[01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:21.750]  You did a good job, dude.
[01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.270]  I was not at all prepared for that.
[01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:24.830]  I hope it wasn't too ugly.
[01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:26.870]  So episode 100 was your favorite.
[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:29.430]  Anything else stand out for you?
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.060]  There were a number of Grow episodes
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.300]  that I remember anticipating.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.700]  I knew they were gonna get recorded
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.540]  because you would tell me,
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.580]  like, oh, so-and-so has finally emailed me back.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.020]  We're gonna set up a show.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.540]  To it's gonna get recorded on Wednesday.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.340]  To it's gonna drop on Monday.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.340]  To furiously taking notes
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.860]  because that was the step I was gonna be doing in a month.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.700]  Right.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.380]  That was the kind of shit that I really enjoyed.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.580]  In going back and listening,
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.660]  I got to kind of relive some of that.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.500]  Nice, nice.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.140]  So there's a lot of fun on the show.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:05.980]  I've had a lot of fun.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:07.340]  I've laughed a couple of times
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.860]  to where I've had to stop recording.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.940]  One of my favorite times now that I'm thinking about it,
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.260]  I smacked my elbow on this chair
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.220]  and I turned to get up to do something.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.380]  I guess I hit myself this week
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.540]  because I was getting to get up
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.060]  and I hit my funny bone and I was still recording
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.260]  and I just sat back down and I was like,
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.420]  mother fuck, I just hit my funny bone
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.780]  and I just talked myself through it
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.340]  and I just left the mic on
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.340]  and I put that in the podcast
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.820]  and I was like, that was kind of funny.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.740]  Some of my favorite moments are mistakes I've made
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.220]  and dumb shit that I've said
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.980]  and I'm just like, I'm not even gonna edit that.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.580]  Whatever, I'll just keep going.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.700]  I've edited some.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.500]  I've stopped editing that crap out now
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.340]  because I'm a human and I'm gonna stutter and stumble
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.660]  and say some dumb shit
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.020]  and I like to show that I'm kind of human a little bit.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.420]  When it's too clean, it feels overproduced
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.220]  and if I wanted that, I'd still have an AM FM radio.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.020]  Perfect.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.300]  You'd listen to Art Bell.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.260]  Probably not.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.340]  Is that like the OG podcast?
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.620]  Remember you'd be driving home from a concert late at night?
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.460]  Well, not you, Mike.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.300]  You lived in Denver.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.900]  I had to drive fucking two and a half hours
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.580]  from Red Rocks back in the day
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.060]  and the only thing, we didn't have podcasting
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.900]  and shit back then.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.660]  I'm old, you guys, I'm sorry.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.940]  Or I was on fish tour.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.140]  I used to travel around the country
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.860]  and go see fish from place to place
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.100]  and we had a tape deck or a radio in the car
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.620]  and once you listen to all the tapes in the car,
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.620]  just put on, if it's nighttime,
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.980]  if it's like 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night,
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.820]  cruise the AM channels and find George Norrie and Art Bell
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.500]  and put on some coast to coast.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.980]  I feel like that was the OG podcast right there.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.580]  That's kind of where that shit kind of got started.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.740]  I never spent enough time on the road to have to go to AM.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]  Oh, man.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.540]  No, I just learned a new thing about you
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:45.780]  that makes me see you differently.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.740]  Those guys, they would talk about aliens.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.020]  You've listened to AM?
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.860]  Oh, dude, if you heard.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.340]  I didn't think there was that much difference
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.580]  between your age and my age,
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.620]  but apparently it includes some AM listening in our 20s.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.340]  My brother Bradley got me addicted
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.260]  to coast to coast AM radio.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.460]  These guys talk about aliens and fucking conspiracies.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.860]  That's what does it to people.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.700]  You'd be driving.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.900]  And they can get this all across America for free?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.740]  Yeah, you can call in and talk to them and contribute
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.820]  and they egg you on with your conspiracy theories.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.820]  They talk about ghosts and fucking.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.500]  My trips, you could always cover
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.100]  with a good catalog of tapes or maybe some books on tape.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:21.940]  Oh, man.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.260]  No AM.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.820]  We did like 20 shows of widespread panic tour
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.100]  in summer tour 2001.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:26.940]  We needed something to listen to, bro.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.100]  Let's see, and I thought this was all the drugs,
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.140]  but apparently there was plenty of AM.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.660]  Well, yeah, imagine to mix the drugs and the AM together.
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.300]  Yeah, there was a stirring element
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.700]  I didn't understand previously,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.740]  and apparently it was AM talk radio.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.900]  Could listen to Phish all night and then AM radio.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.420]  Thank God it wasn't politics.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.220]  I am so ignorant to politics
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.860]  that it's like semi-embarrassing.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.540]  I'm like, oh, I should have paid attention to that stuff.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.020]  Literally all I know of AM talk radio
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.900]  is that one family member used to love talk radio shows
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.580]  about politics on AM radio.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.060]  At this point in the world and at my age,
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.100]  I should be way on top of politics
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.340]  and I would get an F in a political sciences class right now.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.580]  They'd kick me out.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.740]  You're not alone.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.140]  Yeah.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.540]  I'd get a fucking A in Instagram.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.340]  I'm currently watching our city devolve into a beta
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.060]  about a research study that I'm the only person who's read.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.340]  But there's a lot of people trying to debate it.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.540]  So I've given up on trying to get like the masses
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.900]  to do shit correctly.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.180]  It's all about bro science now.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.660]  Nobody cares what science says, it's what bro science says.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.380]  No, it's what it feels like.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.260]  Aw.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.500]  Or what you see.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.340]  Aw.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.180]  And that's-
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.020]  Everybody gets a trophy though.
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.060]  Someone who fucking,
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:42.020]  like that's what I studied in college was like,
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.220]  how this shit gets done and why it gets done
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.060]  and who does it and what rules they follow.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.020]  Like that's what I studied.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.980]  And so to see shit get butchered like this,
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.580]  like I've kind of given up on humanity this week.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.540]  I'll be back next week, folks, probably.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.220]  Let's turn this boat back around
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.700]  before Mike has everybody committing a mass suicide
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.020]  on the podcast.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.660]  I want to get back to gratitude.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.100]  I was going to say gratitude.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.820]  Gratitude, Mike, gratitude.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.100]  Gratitude.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.540]  Hey, I'm grateful to still be here.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.380]  Shout out to-
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.420]  Grateful for this hash for sure.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.340]  All the people that use that hashtag.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.300]  I like it when you ramble hashtag.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.980]  I see those and I fucking love-
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.980]  Hashtag did.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.500]  Yeah, I just said hashtag too.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.340]  But shout out to all the people
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.580]  that support us on the social media.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.020]  That is really fun, you guys,
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.860]  to put out an episode and then within hours
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.140]  to start getting comments about,
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.260]  hey, that episode taught me this or hey, needed this.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.380]  That shit's really cool.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.060]  So all that interaction,
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.580]  the people that like to just listen to us ramble,
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.620]  that's really fun.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.460]  There are a couple of people that said
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.300]  I was depressed or bummed or whatever
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.540]  and hearing you talk about whatever
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.900]  put me in a better mood.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.660]  That shit means a lot to me.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.500]  That is really cool.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.540]  Rescuing your garden, putting you in a better mood.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540]  That's awesome.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.580]  I'm grateful for that.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.340]  There we go.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.180]  I turned it back around, Mike.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.340]  You can't crash my gratitude ship.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.820]  Don't poke the bear.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.020]  Don't look on his face, you guys.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.100]  I wish you could have seen his face.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:07:59.940]  He was like, fuck y'all,
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.540]  crash this thing right now.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.340]  I saw four good e-brake levers
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.140]  in that speech you just gave,
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.420]  which I liked by the way and agree with most of it.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.300]  But there were a couple of points where I was like-
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.700]  I'll turn this podcast right around
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.740]  and take you home, young man.
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.220]  We can belly flop this, that's fine.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.660]  God, Mike.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.060]  Take another dab, drink another Mountain Dew, my friend.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.580]  No, it's just been a fun week.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:22.980]  That's another thing I should say.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.780]  A lot of people tell me about how they look forward
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.140]  to Monday because of my podcast.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.980]  People that have jobs they don't enjoy.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.900]  That's like the biggest compliment
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.900]  I think you can give someone who has a regular job.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.220]  Monday can kick a person's ass.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.140]  Monday fucks us up and we love our job most of the time.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.700]  Monday's so fucked up.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.860]  When people have a fucked up Tuesday,
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.980]  they describe it as having a second Monday.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.220]  That's how fucked up Mondays are.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.540]  But have no fear,
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.620]  because Rasta Jeff is here to fix up your Monday.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.460]  Even being me, sometimes the podcast is like,
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.340]  I will go to bed on Sunday like,
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.740]  man, fuck, I ain't ready for Monday,
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.180]  but at least the show's coming.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.500]  I walk into the office at work
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.820]  and Mike is listening to my podcast.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.860]  Upstairs in the office.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.140]  Sometimes he was on it.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.620]  It scares the tremors.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.940]  Sometimes I need to go back
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.300]  and listen to what the fuck I said.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.340]  I don't know how many listeners
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.780]  happen to be listening the night
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.380]  that Oregon screwed up a bunch of their ID checks
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.620]  the first time.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.820]  I won't repeat what I said,
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.180]  but it wasn't my proudest moment on air.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.820]  I did not edit that out.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.660]  I might have told you I was gonna.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.620]  You told me you were gonna
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.700]  and then I listened like a month later
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.540]  and I was like, mother fuck,
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.140]  that's why people have been sending me weird tweets.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:35.060]  Now those make sense.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:39.100]  And so now I usually listen to the show
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.860]  and I follow the topic string,
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.500]  so if it's one I'm really looking forward to,
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.620]  I make sure to listen to it,
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.180]  but if I wanted, I'd damn sure listen
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.340]  because sometimes we get really high
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.620]  and I say some silly shit.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.660]  Speaking of getting high and saying some silly shit,
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.980]  shout out to Bo Nellis.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.900]  What up, Bo?
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.020]  We miss you, Bo.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:58.940]  Get a show going.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.140]  We miss you.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.340]  Yeah.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.180]  We do.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.420]  We do.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.420]  I miss you.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.260]  I miss your Twitter interactions.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.660]  You guys, if you wanna hang out with us more,
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.780]  if you like listening to the podcast,
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.300]  you can find me on Instagram Live.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.300]  I've been on Instagram Live a lot lately.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.380]  You can see what I'm dabbing.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.740]  You can see what we're doing.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.700]  I hang out.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.820]  You can throw out questions
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.260]  and I will answer them right there on the Instagram Live.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.460]  I actually put, episode number 299
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.260]  was a chunk of Instagram Live clips put together,
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.620]  so if you enjoyed that, let me know.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.540]  I'll put out more of that type of stuff.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.400]  The Throwback Thursday episodes are gone, you guys.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.540]  There's no need to do that.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.500]  I threw them all back.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.620]  I caught us all up.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.220]  Everything's up on YouTube,
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.620]  so it's just gonna be straight up normal episodes.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.060]  I'm gonna try to do two a week.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.140]  We're gonna do Thursday quickies
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.460]  and Monday full-length episodes,
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.700]  and then occasionally I'm gonna put out
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.180]  those Instagram videos.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.660]  So I do plan on bringing you more content, you guys.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.500]  We're at 300.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.940]  I have no plans of stopping.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:52.780]  There's no reason to stop.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.940]  We're finding a better gear.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.100]  Yeah, I just keep getting better at it.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.620]  You guys are listening more.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.940]  The interactions are going crazy.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940]  Yeah.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.300]  I wanna go to 500 now.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.860]  I wanna go to 1,000.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.620]  I think Joe Rogan's one of the only podcasts
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.180]  that I listen to that's made it to 1,000 episodes.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.260]  You qualify that with that you listen to.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.100]  Right.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.380]  There's only a few in my favorites list
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.900]  that have a number more than a couple hundred.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.740]  Okay.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.580]  Rogan's at almost 1,100 now, which is.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.460]  Kevin Smith's got like 40 podcasts,
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.700]  and I listen to a couple of them,
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.060]  and some of them have been around for fucking years.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.060]  Rogan does three shows a week on average,
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.540]  and they're fucking three hours long.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.420]  Because he gets fucked up on Caveman Coffee and Alpha Brain,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.260]  and just fucking.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.620]  And just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.900]  And the topics are amazing.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.100]  Like he brings on the coolest fucking people.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.780]  Some of his shows have been really, really good.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.660]  I end up watching for the guest.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.500]  Yeah.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.060]  That's, if you walk through the trim room at work,
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.660]  that's the number one agreed upon comedian
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.260]  and podcast is Joe Rogan.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.940]  They've just been, we kinda hit a spot
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.540]  where we were tired of giving each other shit
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.300]  over the music choice.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.860]  And so they've been doing just,
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.140]  it's sort of like Pandora for comedy.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:05.980]  Yes, I love it.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.260]  And you only get three to six minutes per artist.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:13.260]  It's never like a long bit or the first half of their DVD
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.700]  or anything like that.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.860]  It's just one or two bits.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.140]  Oh, it's just fucking great.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.100]  That day flies.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.940]  I love walking in and trying, being a comedy nerd,
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.180]  I pride myself in being a comedy nerd.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.660]  I love to walk in mid-bit if I'm passing through,
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.060]  because it's on the way to the men's room or the front door.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.140]  If I'm passing through the trim crew,
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.980]  I'll stop and be like, who is this?
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.420]  Oh, that's Mitch Hedberg, live at this place, 1992.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.100]  Or whatever, I don't know what Hedberg did,
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.180]  but I can tell you, oh, that's Chappelle
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.420]  off of this recording.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.860]  Or that's Rogan off the Rocky Mountain High recording.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.380]  Try to name them or whatever.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.940]  And the trimmers always laugh at me.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.260]  I gotta make a note in GarageBand
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.380]  because I just saw something that I don't like.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.420]  It's okay, just gotta make an adjustment.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.260]  One, 25, 20.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.700]  That's funny, I was thinking the same thing.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.380]  They were listening to a lot of newer R&B and rap
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.060]  and I don't know any of that shit.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.540]  But when they switched to comedy, I was like,
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.580]  oh, fuck, this is Bill Burr, I haven't Bill Burr in forever.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.380]  And they all look at me like, how the fuck do you?
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.260]  I think it was a fun little change up this week.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.940]  Because Bill Burr is a savage.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.580]  All right, you guys, my throat's starting to burn out.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.300]  Do you guys wanna keep going or you wanna take some dabs
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.260]  and start wrapping it up?
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.580]  How's everybody doing on time?
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.220]  All of the above, I got plenty of time.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.420]  All right, I'm down to keep going.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.300]  I'll do some editing and make this podcast not as rambly.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.660]  I say that as I check my phone and see if it's true.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.300]  Right, I'm gonna press pause real quick
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.740]  and make a correction in GarageBand
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.580]  just while I'm thinking about it
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.900]  and then we'll keep going here.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.300]  All right, guys, we are back.
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.220]  We are well medicated, we are well hydrated.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.660]  I've got a big fat dab of the taffy,
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.300]  the taffy that ruined Kevin's life.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.940]  I got some of that on the dabber here.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.260]  Gonna heat up this nail and take a fat dab.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.740]  It's a little ruined to me.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.060]  We took a little break to get a drink.
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.980]  We took a break to fix a technical issue
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.780]  with the computer and the mic here.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.820]  We are back on track.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.900]  As we took a break, I remembered that I wanted to talk
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.260]  about the strain episodes that we've been doing,
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.060]  and those are a lot of fun.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.780]  I was mentioning how much fun I have.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.500]  I felt that it would be very egotistical
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.540]  to go online and do a podcast about something that I bred
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.060]  and hype up my own shit that felt kind of weird.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.260]  But once I did it, everybody responded so well.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.500]  Those are a lot of fun, you guys.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.580]  I have a lot of fun doing those.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.340]  So look forward to more of the strain report episodes
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.180]  coming from me.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.060]  I'm not gonna do them too frequently
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.500]  because I'll run out of them.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.020]  There's only so many to do, but maybe as I create more,
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.780]  I can try to catch up and do backlogs and stuff.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.260]  The strain reports, those have been a lot of fun.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.180]  Mike, I'm gonna take a dab.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.540]  Will you ramble for me?
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.180]  I'm trying.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.220]  What strain report's coming next?
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.660]  What do we gotta look forward to?
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.980]  Just did one, so I haven't planned the next one yet.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.620]  Good times.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.100]  Kev, what are you looking for with the podcast
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.660]  over the next 100 episodes?
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.140]  Probably just a continuation of what he's been doing.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.940]  I don't know if there's really much
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:59.060]  I'm gonna add because I'm not really a grower per se.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.900]  I'm curious too.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.140]  I don't know where it can go for,
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.620]  or where it needs to go from here.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.260]  I think what he's doing is spot on.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.500]  I like letting.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.980]  The thing I'm hoping to see is more guests.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.140]  I don't think I'm alone there.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.220]  And I don't mean more me.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.100]  Right, just more people.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:19.940]  It's hard.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.780]  It is hard.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.320]  We need to find a better way to do guests.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:28.340]  Well, we need a studio that's better located.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.020]  Yeah, being in Pueblo's rough.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.420]  You tell people Pueblo and they take two steps back
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.500]  and check for their wallet.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.060]  Getting them to come down here.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.900]  No, come to this private neighborhood here.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.160]  I can go two places.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.980]  It's just I'm consumed by the current project
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.260]  we're working on.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.660]  That's got me overloaded.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.700]  Sometimes I'm not sure when I'm gonna get to record.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.700]  So I just gotta.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.540]  Everybody I want you to get on the show,
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.300]  that's also true for.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.940]  So I know why it is like it is.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.180]  So I was gonna say,
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.280]  I just like letting the show kind of evolve.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.560]  I do have plans and ideas,
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.740]  but it's doing its thing perfectly.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.740]  I'm not gonna take too many sponsors
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.900]  so you won't get too many ads.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.060]  I'll always support the Helladay Seed Company
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.500]  or who the vendors are
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.860]  because that's kind of a symbiotic relationship there.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.340]  I always plan to share what I'm smoking on,
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.580]  stay honest, keep the people up to date.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.400]  And one thing I've noticed is in early episodes,
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.660]  I had different ideas on some things.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:28.900]  I've said, do follow your feed,
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.200]  do not follow your feed, do follow your feed.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.700]  Okay, now do follow your feed.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.540]  Now don't.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.060]  Like I've changed my opinion and idea
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.560]  and I'm glad that people have still respected me
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.020]  because I've changed my opinion.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.380]  I'm gonna keep doing that.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.540]  I'm gonna keep giving the most updated advice
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.100]  that I can give when I learn more.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.180]  And I'm not gonna,
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.180]  I'm gonna try to not be too prideful
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.320]  and too egotistical to say,
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.020]  hey, I've changed my idea.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.220]  Now this is the way I would do it now
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.100]  because there are things I'm doing way differently now
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:55.500]  than I have ever done before.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.380]  And that's a big part of the reason
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:00.100]  I think the level of grower that you are
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.100]  is because you didn't learn a way and then stick to it.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.740]  I watched so many people fall into that rut,
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.940]  like sort of like it was a cookie recipe.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.540]  And then they would struggle with different genetics
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.960]  because they didn't like to follow the recipe.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.800]  Right.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.520]  And just watching you learn several different systems
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.300]  over the years has been fun.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.740]  I mean, it shows in the herb.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.800]  I've managed three large commercial facilities,
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:29.100]  technically two, because one wasn't very functional.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.100]  I left because it wasn't functional.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.340]  I've managed three large facilities
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:38.340]  and I've ran countless small home grows
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.260]  and I've consulted on hundreds of home grows.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.120]  I've been in enough grows.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.620]  I've ran so many plants that I was doing the math on it.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.880]  I think last year.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.780]  They threatened to kill people
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.380]  for the number you about to say.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.100]  That's true.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:58.920]  Not even fucking around.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.760]  I don't even want to be, yeah,
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.580]  I said I don't pay attention to politics, but Mr.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.780]  You saw that story or at least I brought it up
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.140]  in front of you earlier today.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.780]  They're trying to kill us for having too many plants.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:08.700]  The numbers are large.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.500]  It's not like anything you've got, don't worry.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.980]  But the pounds where you live in.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.860]  Mike, how many pounds, and we can disclose this number.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.940]  How many pounds last year do you think
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.740]  our production facility produced?
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.340]  That's how many pounds of cannabis we produced last year
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.460]  out of that facility.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.340]  Whenever I see on the news that they busted a house
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.660]  and it had this many plants and it had this many pounds
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.740]  and it's worth this many millions of dollars,
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.460]  I always convert that to the product
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.860]  that went through the room that day and chuckle.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.660]  So there was that approximately,
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.480]  we're going to say 700 pounds of cannabis
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.780]  plus however many pounds of trim in one year.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.580]  In my first year at a facility,
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:52.260]  I ran another facility for approximately a year
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.540]  and my first harvest there was 321 pounds.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.100]  So I've produced over a thousand pounds
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.500]  of cannabis in two years.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:04.100]  Fair.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.100]  I'd like to say I've got a little bit of experience.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:08.940]  Right.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.100]  And then in the process to learning to that,
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.580]  I only post my good pictures to Instagram.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.020]  I post my successes.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.900]  The way that I learned the most was my fuck ups.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.740]  If I had 10 clones.
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.260]  Fuck ups to the teachers.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:27.100]  Mike saw me grow buds that were the size of NFL footballs
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.180]  stacked on top of each other.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.380]  But when we cut them up the middle, they were moldy.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.180]  It was an 11 ounce plant, y'all.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.620]  Moldy up the middle.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.220]  White rhino buds, seriously,
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.740]  properly inflated NFL football.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:40.680]  It was gorgeous.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.140]  Kev looked at me like, oh, you got jokes.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.500]  I know, and that's when I stopped literally shopping
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.220]  with any other provider or caregiver
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.100]  was the day I saw you take that,
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.220]  find it and throw the entire thing in a trash bag
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.060]  and get it out of the house.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:54.900]  That wasn't fucking with that.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.460]  It was all moldy.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.460]  But no, I've been in a hundred other places
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.060]  where people were like cut around it.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.980]  But now I know not to grow football size buds.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.260]  I have taken plants and fed them.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.460]  Oh, it says to give it 50 mils of this.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.100]  I give it a hundred and see what happens.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.220]  And done that.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.740]  We have done everything we can
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.220]  to torture a plant on purpose here.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.620]  That's how I have gotten good.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.460]  I wasn't afraid.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.140]  If I had 10 plants, I only need nine to finish.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.420]  I got one I can experiment with.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.060]  So if I was gonna do something weird,
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.420]  just pick one and pick an experiment for this grow.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.980]  And if it dies, you got nine.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:32.100]  You only plan on having nine live to the end.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.940]  Be ready to kill one, play with it.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.940]  The best thing about your crop of weed
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.220]  that you're growing right now
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.860]  is it's not the last crop of weed that you're gonna grow.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.460]  God willing.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:43.420]  I have some faith.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.460]  Most of us are able to grow again.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.220]  Most of us are like we're in Colorado.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.500]  Most of the lot of people are in California, Oregon.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.620]  A lot of people are gonna be smart.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.140]  They're gonna follow the rules.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:53.980]  They're gonna be discreet.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.500]  They're gonna be careful.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.780]  Right now the market's changing really fast.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:01.600]  And as it changes, who's doing the growing is changing.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.780]  Very true.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.620]  Very true.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.500]  There was a thing that came through here
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.660]  when legalization, when medical happened,
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.460]  everybody went to the grow store and bought a grow light.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.460]  And then a year and a half later, Craig's List.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.780]  And nothing but grow lights.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.100]  Everybody had grow shit for sale
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.180]  because they all buy all the fancy equipment
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.380]  that the grow store will sell you.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.900]  And they say, go do this and you'll be able to grow.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.660]  And they go home and they can't grow for fuck
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.980]  because they didn't listen to a podcast.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.820]  They didn't buy books.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.020]  They didn't do their homework.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.940]  But they don't realize that it's like getting a puppy.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.900]  That has me when people ask me like,
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.180]  what's the most important thing I can have in a grow?
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.620]  I'm like the fucking book.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.460]  Yeah.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.020]  That's 100% the knowledge.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.100]  Some time and dedication.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.260]  It's not just gonna be walking there once a day
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.360]  and look at it and leave.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.060]  You gotta fucking take care of things.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.580]  There's work to do every day.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.940]  When I see people looking for like the,
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.420]  I wanna be able to have it hidden
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.060]  and it needs to be the size of a kitchen table or smaller.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.700]  And I need to be able to just look at it
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.320]  once or twice a month.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.860]  And I'm like, then go to the weed store.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:04.700]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.860]  Or if it's only that important to you.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.100]  Check out Love for the Plant.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.900]  Those guys have a micro grow mastered.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.140]  A camo micro grow.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:13.980]  They're great.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.940]  There's some beautiful micro grows,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.740]  but like it's the hands off,
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:20.700]  ignore it component that I don't understand at all.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.380]  No matter how much monitoring and auto shit you have,
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:24.220]  you have to be there.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.460]  You have to know if there's a spider mite,
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:26.780]  if there's powdery mildew,
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.120]  you have to defoliate.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.540]  You have to put trellis up.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.220]  You have to work the canopy into the trellis.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.180]  I like to pop the stems.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.300]  I just call it popping them.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.180]  I grab them.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.660]  I would grab here.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:38.500]  I'd grab here.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.980]  I guess that's about a half inch of space
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.420]  between my fingers and turn.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.740]  And it goes, it makes that noise.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.780]  I like to break all the plants.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.020]  I'll start low and work my way all the way up the plant.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.980]  And then I'll start with the lowest branch
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.220]  and work up each branch.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.260]  Every branch gets all popped all the way up
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.220]  about every four to six inches apart.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.740]  I'll pop each plant a hundred times
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.940]  if it's a decent size plant.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.780]  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.540]  We'll leave there with our hands fucking looking
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.380]  all calloused up on pop day.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.020]  But there's work to do every day.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.860]  You got to trellis them.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.980]  You got to pop them.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.220]  Make sure everything's working.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.740]  If you got an auto water system,
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:10.820]  how do you know an emitter isn't clogged?
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:11.860]  We get clogged emitters.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.380]  We get clogged filters.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.220]  Pumps burn out.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.060]  Shit goes wrong.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:15.880]  Fans burn out.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.720]  Bulbs go out.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.540]  Bulbs burn out.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:18.380]  Yeah.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.940]  Light bulbs never burn out at the end
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.980]  or beginning of a cycle.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.420]  It's always about week six when everything's big
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.300]  and bushy and fucking obnoxious
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.860]  and you got to move shit and get up there.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.180]  Bulb, yeah, shit's going to go wrong.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.340]  And it needs that attention.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.980]  Every time I've seen somebody try to do,
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.100]  I mean, even like a four day vacation.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.060]  It's just, the crow gets tackled.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.260]  Why don't you go do this?
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.340]  And I'm like, are you going to come here
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.980]  and take care of the plants?
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.180]  There was an old video that I saw on YouTube
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.020]  and I'm pretty sure it was sub cool.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.220]  And his first sentence to the crowd is,
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.820]  shut up, we all have to get home in a day and a half.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.220]  In the entire room, they didn't even laugh.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.380]  They just went, huh.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.220]  Yep.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.220]  Because all of them immediately got the joke,
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.700]  understood why it was made,
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.700]  realized it was true for them too
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.500]  and wanted to hear what the man had to say.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:10.540]  Because just when you're in charge of a crop,
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.540]  every time you shut that door, the clock starts.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.700]  It's like, well, Mike and I run a large facility.
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.140]  When we drive away, I look in the rear view mirror,
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.540]  like is anything on fire?
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.460]  Is there any smoke coming out?
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.340]  Cause I've only got like 12 hours to leave here
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.420]  before shit starts going wrong.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.500]  And we come home and record a podcast
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.260]  and go take care of our family life
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.300]  and take a poop of shower and some food, get back there.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.500]  Make sure nothing went wrong.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.500]  When it's on that scale
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.220]  and it's not like other industries
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.260]  where they've been doing it for a hundred years.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.700]  And so the industrial version of what you need
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.260]  is time tested and updated.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.660]  And so a lot of our shit we have to do on our own.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.940]  And the start of every day is go find what broke.
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:54.540]  And most days nothing broke,
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.980]  but the day you don't check, everything broke.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.060]  Everything.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:24:59.900]  Yep.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:00.740]  So you gotta be there.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.580]  That's just how it goes.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.260]  In any size group, I watched family members that grew
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:06.180]  every time they would come up to Denver
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:09.020]  and visit for a day and a half, their shit would die.
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.620]  And so it got to the point where we were like,
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.140]  Hey, we've got tickets to a game.
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.340]  And they were like, fuck off.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.620]  Every time I come up and visit for two days,
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.980]  I come home to no livelihood.
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.540]  And I have to start from scratch.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.980]  That's why people don't realize they gotta give me
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.260]  like a solid week in advance.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.260]  If you want me to do something Saturday,
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.780]  you should have hit me up last Saturday
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.220]  because I have to get the plants on the right rhythm
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.300]  to be gone overnight Saturday.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.020]  Because if I water them Friday,
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.260]  then I can't water them Saturday before I leave
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.500]  because then they're going to be too wet.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:38.980]  I got to water them right before I leave
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.740]  for whatever we're doing Saturday night.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.580]  Got to water them.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.980]  We're going to be gone overnight Saturday.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.780]  Got to leave them at like noon Saturday
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.980]  and then get in the car and fucking go.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.740]  So I can be back Sunday before they start getting too dry.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.780]  And that's what makes me ripping in my hair
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.860]  every time I hear somebody like, well, it's just weed.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:55.580]  Anyone can grow it.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.180]  And I'm like, no.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.540]  If anyone could just grow it, you can do it.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.340]  I'm not even a grower and that irritates me so bad
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.820]  when people tell me that.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:06.020]  Just try to force me to grow weed
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.380]  because everyone can do it.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.700]  I'm like, no, they can't.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.620]  Anyone can also make cash, bro.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:12.460]  Yeah, no.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.380]  I've run into this at every level
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.620]  from like serious business owners
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:21.660]  that have invested millions to newspaper reporters
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.740]  and city officials and police and friends.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.940]  And it's just, oh, it's easy.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.100]  Anybody can grow weed.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.260]  And it's no, like it's an acquired skill
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.660]  that takes years and years and years of training
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:35.500]  to even get close to being able to do-
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.300]  But anyone can grow weed.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.100]  But I mean, it depends on what your target is.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.700]  A lot of people are just growing weed at home, dude.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.340]  And they're throwing some, a light.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.020]  They got an affordable light and a little hot.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.660]  Anybody can follow the steps.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.500]  And they're doing it.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.340]  They're satisfied with their product,
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.780]  which that makes me happy.
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.860]  But to grow, to make a profitable product
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.700]  on a commercial level, on a reliable scale,
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.820]  that's when you start getting into a lot of nuances.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:03.060]  If you want to figure out dial in a strains nuances
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:04.700]  and dry and cure things properly,
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.580]  like anybody could just throw some seed
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.940]  or a clone in there and they can make it happen.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.620]  And if they're satisfied with that, that's cool.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.540]  I'm proud of them.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.860]  And I want them to smoke that and love it.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.660]  But if you want to take it to the next level,
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.700]  it's going to take some skill.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.220]  It's going to take some learning.
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.020]  You can teach, I would say I can teach
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.020]  probably 60 to 70% of this, but 40 to 30 to 40%,
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.100]  you're going to have to be beside me every day
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.700]  for a couple of weeks to figure it out.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:31.460]  There's shit that I can't even teach you
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.780]  through this podcast, through a video.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.980]  You got to come touch the plants.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.820]  You have to be-
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.820]  It's a trade more than an equation.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.180]  Yeah, you're going to have to look,
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.060]  to tell you how much exactly I want defoliated,
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.620]  we have to stand back from the room
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:46.140]  and I have to show you the whole room
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.500]  instead of one small section.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.900]  And then I'll be like, I don't know,
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.380]  my view of a grow is way different
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.860]  from other people's, I think.
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.980]  It's fun teaching new people how to do it on our scale.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.420]  Because you don't, especially with that task,
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.820]  it's not something you can see until you're done with it.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.380]  I have to teach people, say we're defoliating a table.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.460]  We've got our average room, so room A is 40 lights.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.300]  Room A is 40 lights and it would take two or three dudes
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.300]  an entire day to properly defoliate
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.420]  for a week two defoliation the way that I want it
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.540]  for proper light penetration.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.220]  If we put the right people in there,
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.180]  if we put the wrong people in there
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.980]  and don't tell them to move around,
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.820]  it would take four hours to defoliate
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.140]  one section really heavily and the rest of the grow
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.380]  would just be leafy.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.220]  So I've got to tell them, listen to a song
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.420]  and every song, move to another table.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.820]  Listen to a song and every song, move to another table.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.460]  Because they're not used to such a large grow,
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.460]  they think they're gonna go in there
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.100]  and defoliate that room.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:42.940]  And they don't realize.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:43.780]  Like from left to right.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.620]  Yeah.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:48.300]  And I tell them, just walk around the table,
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.500]  just kind of always be shuffled step
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.220]  into the left or the right.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.620]  And just work your way like a typewriter, dude,
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.780]  you're eating a piece of corn.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.260]  I don't want table one to be naked
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.940]  and table three to be super furry.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.860]  So just start, give me a level one manicure,
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.300]  a level two, a level three,
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.540]  and just work your way back and forth.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.100]  It's hard to get people, yeah,
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.220]  because they think they're gonna go in there
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.860]  just like their home grow, that's one light.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.580]  I can leaf this in like an hour.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.660]  There are 40 lights in here.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.100]  If it takes you an hour to do the one at home,
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:15.920]  that's 40 in here.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.900]  Plus these are much beefier plants
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:20.900]  because we got Gavitas and turbo fucking charged.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.480]  Really tall ceilings.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.320]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.620]  And ridiculous HVAC and Rostagef tech
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.300]  and trellising all day.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.660]  So there are beefy plants in there.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:30.140]  It's gonna take you quite a while to reach in
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.580]  and trellis all that shit.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.900]  That middle row, it's hard for me to reach.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.260]  I'm six five.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:36.620]  You can only imagine what it's like for.
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.320]  Dude, I'm responsible for all the tags at the bottom.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.780]  I know how hard they are to reach.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.100]  Is that why they're in the dirt?
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.940]  Yep.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:44.780]  Shattered the turtle.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:46.860]  Only metric fucking, oh God.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.980]  Only metric certified people know why that's funny.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.860]  All of Mike's plant tags are in the dirt, you guys.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.620]  Not all you fucker.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:55.860]  All of Mike's plants are fucking three feet tall
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.940]  and the tags are just in the fucking dirt.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:00.300]  Don't make me talk about beer right now.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.420]  Oh yeah, that room is not a happy place to be.
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.340]  Fuck with me, I can fight back.
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:05.940]  That's so funny.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.060]  Yep.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:10.200]  So if you work in a metric regulated facility,
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.140]  wherever metrics in like Washington and Colorado.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.940]  Most legal states have adopted it.
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:16.980]  So if you work with metric
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.820]  and you've got those stupid fucking metric plant tags
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.900]  that are supposed to be affixed in such a stupid way,
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.260]  I'd find that to be obnoxious.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.300]  I wish it would hang so that I could read the tag
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.140]  instead of have it.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.420]  Anyhow, here's the thing for you to do.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:33.420]  I had somebody helpfully recommend we do it the other way.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.100]  Fuck everyone involved.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.860]  But anyway, here's the thing to do.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.680]  Find your metric or a compliance person.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.940]  Mike is my person that handles metrics.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.420]  Don't do this, I know what he's gonna say.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:46.260]  It's really fucked up.
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.300]  This is really funny.
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.140]  This is really funny.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.860]  I want you to walk out of a grow room
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.020]  with a perplexed look on your face.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.140]  Most of you have it already
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.020]  because you've been in the grow room
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.260]  and you've been smoking dabs all fucking day
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.100]  and the lights are bright.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.340]  You just go like, huh?
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.340]  Find your compliance person or your metric person
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:00.780]  and walk up to them and say,
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.420]  hey, why don't any of the plants in room A
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:05.140]  have tags on them?
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:05.960]  And just-
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.620]  Don't say that shit to people.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.460]  Watch your metric person.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.820]  Just the things that make, like, no.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.940]  So one of the like,
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.860]  there are like five things
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.620]  that have to absolutely happen in a grow.
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.300]  You have to have a badge on.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.380]  If you don't have a badge on, you gotta, no.
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.380]  Numero uno.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.980]  Yeah, gotta have a visible badge
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.180]  above the waist at all times.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.020]  Is there either a vis-
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.460]  I feel weird talking about it without having it on.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.300]  Mine's right there.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.140]  I can see it.
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:29.060]  Like, that's how close I keep that badge.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.100]  When I go, if I leave,
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.380]  if I leave, I take it with me.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.060]  If I go to other dispensaries to shop,
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.860]  I take it with me because oftentimes
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.020]  you can get a tour if you're me
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.900]  and they're like, you got your badge?
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.340]  Like, yeah, come on back.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.420]  Like, if you don't have it, you're fucked.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.040]  You just missed your chance for a tour.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.180]  But it brings opportunity sometimes.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.900]  And you also get a discount if you're in the industry.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.900]  But number one, you gotta have a badge.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.980]  Number two, where am I getting plant tags?
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.340]  Like, number two or number three is
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.540]  every plant has to be tagged.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.700]  In Colorado, pretty much too, is plant tags.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.660]  Yeah, you gotta have a plant tag.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:03.300]  Maybe badge, license on the wall, plant tags.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:05.900]  But plant tags ain't down number four.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:06.820]  Waste accountability.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.060]  You gotta weigh the fucking waste.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.860]  That's things that people fuck up on all the time.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.100]  Like, there's such a board issue.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.580]  We just listed both components of my job.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.260]  Keeping track of plant tags
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.020]  and making sure all the waste gets weighed.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.100]  And then Mike does all the weighing and packaging.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.420]  Yeah, like 99% of my job is those first two things.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.260]  The part that people would be like,
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.180]  man, I just wanna go weigh weed all day.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:29.020]  Mike's like, I gotta weigh the fucking weed all day.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.400]  Literally, that's what I'm doing all day tomorrow.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.660]  For eight hours, I'll be putting weed on a scale
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.620]  and writing numbers down.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.100]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.260]  Literally for eight straight hours.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:38.620]  But the number two thing is
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.420]  those plants have to have a tag.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.020]  When I cut a clone off of a plant,
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.600]  I have to find that tag and write the strain name
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.200]  onto a piece of paper.
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:50.640]  The mother plant, that tag number that the clone came from,
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.080]  and then how many clones came off of it, and the date.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.120]  And then that sticker has to go with my clones at all times.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.040]  Then once those clones are put into a medium of anything,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.320]  they come out of an EasyCloner.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.600]  Once they're rooted, Mike has to immediately take this,
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.480]  the list is made when the clones are cut.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.320]  Goes into the computer as clones.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.400]  As soon as they're put into dirt,
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.880]  Mike moves them into another section of the computer
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.840]  called Vegetative Stage, and then they get these tags.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.760]  Every single one of them has to have a tag.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.680]  My cloner holds 180 clones.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.120]  And for those of you who don't know
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.480]  about this particular task in detail,
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.920]  each tag has to be filled out by hand.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:32.120]  So Mike writes, Chem 4, Chem 4, Chem 4, Chem 4,
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.620]  Chem 4, Chem 4.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:35.520]  I do about 40 clones of each strain
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.360]  because I want to fill the rooms with chunks.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.020]  You know the scene at the beginning of The Simpsons
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.520]  where Bart's at the chalkboard?
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.160]  I never understood how much that skill,
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.760]  like in grade school, would come in handy later in life.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.520]  I was like, dude, I did that.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.200]  But now it's like fucking sour diesel,
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.820]  sour diesel, sour diesel.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.200]  My favorite is when you write Gorilla Glue
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.520]  and nobody can read what the fuck it says.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.680]  Golden Goat, we're like, what is Soldier Cloak?
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.280]  What is Soldier Cloak?
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.560]  Did we get some new genetics here?
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.280]  No, we just got an asshole that can't fucking write.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.280]  You gotta write in Sharpie, and if you use a fine point,
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.520]  it's not legible unless you've got the tag
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.040]  pressed to your face, which is fun
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.840]  because sometimes they fall into the dirt,
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.160]  which is covered with nutrients,
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.880]  and sometimes they get sprayed with sprays,
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.680]  which are full of sprays.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.200]  And so you don't want that shit in your face.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.480]  So you gotta use the fat Sharpie,
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.720]  which fucking dulls after like two good, two tags.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.320]  So you end up fucking writing with like
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.480]  a goddamn paintbrush, and I can't write for shit
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.960]  to begin with, and my fucking, oh.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.200]  Don't even get me started, Jeff.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.680]  Too late, already got you started.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.720]  Too late, did it, I like it.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:38.360]  Anybody who fills out that tag is 100% with me,
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.240]  the rest of you, thanks for joining the room.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.280]  Why don't we get, you see the labels
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.240]  I've got over there, bro?
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.120]  Like for my, for those labels,
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:46.280]  they come out of that normal printer.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.880]  Not compliant from what I understand.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.520]  We can't just print those and stick them onto that?
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.240]  Pretty sure the stick is noncompliant.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.800]  Ask my D.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.360]  Because the stuff that's written on the front of that,
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.160]  in the back of it, like I'm,
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.040]  I would have to talk to someone above me about that.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.440]  Okay, I've never seen another facility do that,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.880]  so my idea may be noncompliant, you may be correct,
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.720]  because we see a lot of other tags.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.320]  We could just be too high to buy the right printer
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.160]  and the right tag.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.000]  My guess is that anything you stick
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.600]  isn't gonna hold right because of the moisture.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.280]  Nah, they make plastic ones that'll be perfect,
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.320]  or we stick them on the outside of the fucking plant.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.640]  Either way, either way, I'm cool with it.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.440]  Metric tags, go in there, walk out of the room
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.760]  with this look on your face, like what the hell happened?
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.280]  And then walk up to your compliance person,
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.200]  metric person, and say,
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.280]  what happened to all the tags in B?
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.040]  And they're gonna have a little,
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.960]  they might pee themselves just a touch, just a touch.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.480]  Depending on their anxiety level at the moment,
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.760]  they might pee themselves a lot.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.680]  Depending on how long metric has been spinning around.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:46.440]  Metric likes to give you the wheel of death.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.480]  You try to use metric and it just shows you on the screen,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.840]  it just spins, the cursor just goes,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.000]  mm, not today, motherfucker.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.400]  It always happens.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.560]  Nine times out of 10, metric will freeze
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.180]  when you've got a delivery driver waiting to pick up
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:00.800]  and you're just waiting to print the manifest.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.360]  Because I know people would say,
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.940]  why don't you print it before they come?
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:07.140]  Because if you put a driver name and a car license plate
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.320]  on a manifest and print it,
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.360]  I fucking promise you a different driver
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.040]  and a different car will show up.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.760]  One of the two will not be accurate.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.680]  And you have to reprint.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.840]  You cannot, it's a Colorado regulated thing.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.000]  You have to reprint, you can't white it out.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.240]  It's gotta go back to the internet.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.480]  You gotta adjust it in the internet.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.320]  Then you gotta print it.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.600]  So you just wait for them to show up.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.060]  Because if they say, Kevin's coming at four in a Honda,
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.000]  I guarantee you Mike's showing up at five in a Nissan.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.960]  Like that's fucking the medical marijuana industry.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.520]  That's how it goes.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.840]  It's gotten better, but yeah.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.760]  We've got some drivers that are actually pretty punctual
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.640]  and we piss them off because we take a long time.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.800]  And I actually, I like it when they're on time and stuff.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.520]  It looks much better for this industry.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:48.040]  The one dude shows up way early and that ain't cool.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.460]  The other dude, same time, every week, every pickup.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.300]  I love that guy.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.480]  Yup, consistency.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.440]  That's how you make me happy at work.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.600]  Hey you guys, if you are one of the drivers
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.240]  in those little silver sprinter vans
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.840]  that's doing pickups and dispensaries, bro.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.400]  You guys, you look like heady wooks.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.880]  Nothing against the heady wooks.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.700]  Kevin, love you bro.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.880]  I got my hat pins too.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.720]  I got my grassroots hat, I got my baggy pants.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.120]  I got my fucking Merrells.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.200]  I'm fucking wook the fuck out.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.240]  I got dreadlocks down to the floor.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.600]  When I see that paired with work equipment.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.100]  Now when I see that wook and that van,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.400]  I'm a good person, but I started thinking
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.400]  like some fucking Ocean's 13 shit
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.600]  and how to get that fucking van in my garage.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.120]  Like, and you guys, you're kind of,
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.080]  you're totally identifying who you are
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.520]  and what you're doing.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.040]  This is, it's legal now.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.240]  Yes, but motherfuckers are still motherfuckers.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.480]  You don't have to worry about the police,
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:47.080]  but you have to worry about thieves and be safe, please.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.600]  I know it sounds like the old man just preaching to you,
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.680]  but when you're all wooked out in that sprinter van,
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.000]  I know what you got and I'm a good person,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.240]  but that doesn't mean that everybody
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.960]  who has made that correlation,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.480]  because you see him in Denver in the right lane,
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.120]  lost as fuck, looking at their GPS going,
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.240]  where's Livewell?
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.960]  And just fucking, they're just driving a sprinter van,
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.520]  dreadlocks and fucking hat pins and a hoodie,
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.200]  fucking leaned up over the steering wheel high as shit.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.600]  Like, I can spot them.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.880]  I've seen a couple of them when I've been out.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.800]  I drive to Denver frequently and you got the sprinter van
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.840]  with the fucking refrigeration in the back.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.040]  So you got concentrates or you're picking up
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.320]  and it's obvious and you're not an armored truck
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.960]  and you've got more shit in you than an armored truck would.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.040]  So kind of keep that in mind, you guys.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040]  I was trying not to do any of the little
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:35.880]  pranks I got, yeah. Or if you're on the other side
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.840]  of that token, hey, there's a bunch of fucking hippies.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.200]  If you're on the other side of that token,
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.040]  there's a bunch of fucking hippies
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.480]  driving around in sprinter vans.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.760]  Cause tip me out, that's all I'm saying.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:43.600]  Commission.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.840]  Oh my God.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.840]  Hit up my fucking Patreon.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.120]  I love you guys so much.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:51.960]  Yep.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.880]  It, as we come out of the shadows,
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.080]  we need to remember why we did some of the shit
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.120]  we did in the shadows.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.920]  Like, I remember how good it felt to be free here
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.360]  and how much I wanted to walk up to everybody
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.240]  and be like, you know what?
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.880]  I like weed.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.360]  And that's all.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.040]  And then just walk off.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:11.880]  Because it was fine.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.040]  Like it was, there was so much shit heaped onto it
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:16.880]  for so long.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.000]  And when we finally got to the point where like,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.760]  as a boating population, we said, fuck prohibition.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.280]  We're done with that shit.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.080]  Weeds legal here, like regular legal,
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.800]  get it at a store legal.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.680]  Like that was before we went overboard
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.960]  with the rules and regs and shit.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.320]  But like, I remember how good that felt.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.800]  And I remember why we shed a lot of the stuff
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.000]  that we had during the prohibition days.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.200]  But dude, now they're busting like 30 guys a week
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.800]  who are just growing a hundred plants in their shed.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.120]  And every one of these motherfuckers,
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.080]  they bust them and they're like, what were you thinking?
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.240]  And they were like, I thought it was legal.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.720]  And I just want to fucking slap these people.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.800]  Like you're ruining it for the rest of us.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.120]  What aren't you getting?
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.360]  Like, I get that it's still 3,500 a pound
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.600]  if you can get it all the way to New York,
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.760]  but fuck your profit.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.560]  Like you're ruining our dream.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.400]  Quit it.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.680]  Quit it.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:12.520]  Yeah.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.240]  All right, Mike.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.080]  Or at least be circumspect about it.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.720]  Like there used to be whole magazine articles
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.200]  about not getting caught by your landlord.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.720]  And we got people showing up, running a house,
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.960]  fucking kicking doors down.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.080]  I had a friend who used to manage a grocery store
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.760]  and he told me that one of his favorite things to do
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.320]  was when kids would come in and be all hyped.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.600]  Like I got my medical marijuana card,
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.760]  I want four lights, I want a filter,
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.480]  I'm gonna go hard, I'm gonna go blow up the whole basement.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.920]  They'd buy all this shit and they'd pay cash for it.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.320]  And he'd smile and hand them a bunch of boxes
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.720]  that say grow light, ballast, carbon filter.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]  And he'd smile and go, there you go.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.880]  And they'd be like, can I get a box or something?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.120]  He'd be like, nope, good luck, have a good night.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.840]  He'd just carry that shit right out to their car.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.320]  And he'd be like, I thought you were bad, dude.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.800]  I thought you were fucking gonna go hard
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.840]  because it's legal.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.120]  And now that you're thinking about it,
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.200]  you got to carry four lights into your house.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.160]  You don't want anyone to see that shit.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.360]  It wasn't just for the police
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.080]  that we went through all that bullshit.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.040]  There were articles about hiding from your landlord
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.880]  because sometimes landlords get pissed
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.800]  and throw your ass out in the street.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.640]  And if you're growing weed illegally,
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.680]  they can do that without batting an eyelash
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.880]  regardless of what landlord-tenant law is in your state.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.560]  I don't like to talk too much about stuff like this,
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.400]  but it's a reality.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.160]  When medical marijuana first became legal here,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.280]  there was a guy, Kevin's shaking his head,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.040]  you know who I'm talking about?
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.520]  A guy named Derek Wagner
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.240]  who had a medical marijuana grow in this neighborhood
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.000]  and three guys kicked in his front door
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.160]  and murdered him for his medical marijuana grow.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.000]  So-
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  People forget that it's worth a lot of money.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.560]  Back then it was worth $3,500 a pound.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.600]  It was $300 an ounce easily around here.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.040]  And once you got it out of here, it was way more.
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.360]  It's 4,000 on the East Coast,
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.800]  5,000 on the East Coast back then.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.440]  And they knew people East,
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.680]  the people that shot him and killed him.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.800]  There's one of the sheriffs up North,
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.200]  I wanna say El Paso or one of those,
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.680]  might've been Denver,
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.920]  racked up like 11 homicides
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.540]  that they could tie to exactly that string of events.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.160]  People who want weed but don't have money for weed,
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.720]  find out you have weed,
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.560]  shoot you and take your weed.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.400]  And then take it back to wherever they're from
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.120]  and sell it at the ridiculous price
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.420]  that weed sells for there.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.200]  There's still plenty of that in Colorado
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.160]  because it's still a commodity.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.080]  You're basically posting on Facebook,
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.000]  hey guys, look at all this jewelry I just bought.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.320]  By the way, I don't have a safe,
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.840]  it's just in my spare bedroom.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.320]  Just because it's legal in Colorado
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  and we are kind of soft.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.080]  We're soft.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.120]  Not everybody around us is super soft
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.520]  and we've gotten soft and comfortable.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.520]  The people, here's what I think I'm trying to say.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.080]  We don't have to have that edge anymore
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.880]  because we're not dealing with the black market anymore.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.280]  It used to be a gangster business.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.520]  It used to be a thug business.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.440]  The people that used to grow and have cannabis
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.280]  and produce that much of a valuable product
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.760]  had a gun, had some street credit, had some homies,
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:08.200]  knew how to throw down, knew what to look for.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.800]  Then one day we're like, it's legal.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.240]  And then people that had no business
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.440]  in that kind of business got in that business
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.360]  and didn't realize I've kind of delved
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.640]  into the black market.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.200]  Like doctors, lawyers were setting up businesses.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.120]  Like our friend that we used to have the dispensary with,
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.720]  he had no business dealing with some of my other people.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.960]  I was a middleman for people
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.720]  that he should have never been involved with,
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.440]  but he was because of me.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.840]  Well, there were a lot of people that came in,
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.840]  came in the door in those days looking to move product
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.880]  that they never could have moved safely
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.320]  in any other market.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.320]  I'm not, again, I could have robbed
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.440]  some of those fucking people.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.480]  I could have said, boo.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:51.120]  And they would have, see, where's he, I'm sorry.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.800]  They had no business being in that sort of market.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.640]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.080]  My 14 year old Kevin looks like,
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.440]  or cousin Kevin looks like Omar from The Wire
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.640]  to most of these people.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.600]  It was just fucking nuts.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.000]  They'd come in terrified.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:03.840]  They all looked the same.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.440]  They're fucking clutching the messenger bag
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.000]  that held two quarter pound jars.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.240]  And they'd come in hugging it like it was a baby,
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.560]  but they were trying to football carry it.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.760]  And they'd go, is your purchasing manager here?
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.440]  And then they'd look around the waiting room
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.160]  to see if anybody heard.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.480]  Every fucking time.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.840]  And if they tried to sell that by the ounce
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.920]  to their friends even,
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.920]  they were gonna get a gun in their face real quick.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.760]  Yeah.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.640]  And that's just how the market used to be.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.680]  People forgot that.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.920]  People got soft and complacent.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.880]  And they let their shit be seen.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.280]  I'll be driving and I'll see somebody
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:38.960]  making a delivery to a dispensary
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.400]  and they open the back of their truck
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:44.280]  and there's so much product right there.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.520]  And it's like, what are you doing, dude?
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.920]  You're not even barely paying attention.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.200]  Like a random dude with a brick
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:54.080]  in his dream could have your shit in 30 seconds.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:54.920]  What are you doing?
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.240]  A fast guy with some Nikes.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.160]  Yep.
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.080]  That's all it takes.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.760]  Didn't you see Ninja Turtles 2,
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.600]  see where the U is?
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.800]  Grab one box and run.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.400]  How fast was that truck emptied?
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.880]  And you're high as fuck in downtown Denver
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.800]  leaving the roll top open.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.560]  Like, come on now.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.600]  Pay attention.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600]  All right, you guys wanna take more dabs
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  and start wrapping up the podcast.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.520]  We've been going for quite a while.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.720]  There's gonna be some editing to be done on this episode.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.560]  Thanks for watching guys.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.400]  This is gonna get edited.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.920]  Yeah, we're gonna edit this down to something listenable
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.400]  instead of just fully rambles.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.280]  Let's take some dabs.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:25.600]  I almost used my actual Bic pen as a dabber here on accident.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.920]  I'm glad I paid attention to that.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.160]  How long have we been going?
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.760]  Oh, we've got two hours of stuff on the screen,
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.000]  but I would say we've been going for an hour.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:34.880]  Give or take.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.720]  Mike nodded his head.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.040]  Who remembers the time I tried to write with my dabber?
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:39.880]  No, I picked up this pencil.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:40.720]  Way safer than dabbing with a writer.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.640]  And tried to write with this.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.200]  Yeah, I was gonna say I finally matched him out
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.840]  because I almost just took a dab with my actual pen.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.560]  There was a story where they tried to say
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.680]  a kid died from weed and he actually died
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.640]  from smoking plastic pez dispenser.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.280]  And yeah, that's how that happens
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.960]  is people try to dab off a Bic pen.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:57.920]  That's different shit.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:00.440]  That's like when people get drunk and drive into people
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.160]  and they smoke the joint before they left the bar,
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.400]  but they also had 172 beers and they're like,
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.080]  oh, they crashed and died because they smoked weed.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.160]  Spent $900 on beer.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.360]  Getting fucking 172 beers.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.960]  Like, look at his credit card tab.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.840]  Like, come on.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:13.960]  But it had to be the weed
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.680]  because alcohol is completely safe and okay.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.160]  You could buy it at the bar.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.040]  We'll have to get me back for a Mike goes fucking off
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.120]  for a while show.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.400]  A couple of emailers.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.760]  Data points that.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.680]  Emailers have asked for Mike.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.080]  They want an episode on how to be active in their area
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.920]  and just more Mike rambles.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.280]  Oh, yeah, we can do that.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.200]  You guys should send me more of that shit too.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.120]  Mike, do you have yourself?
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.160]  Here's a dabber.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.640]  Would you like some of my fine concentrates
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.000]  or would you like some of your sour diesel or?
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.200]  Trying to figure out how many more I wanna take
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.560]  before I leave and thinking I wanna go for King Louie.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.480]  Dab the King Louie.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.520]  There's a dabber.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.360]  Here is a.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.360]  I definitely don't need any more Jules.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.200]  Rig.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.800]  Here is a carb cap that works with that rig.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.160]  It looks like you need El Torcherino, El Inferno.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:04.920]  There you go.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.200]  That's why I work with Sharpies all day
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.360]  and none of my hash is labeled.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.560]  So I've gotta keep it in the fucking packaging.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.280]  There's so much required labeling
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.120]  that like we haven't gotten around
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.760]  to doing the useful labeling yet.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.160]  That's my, more than I want.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.480]  Yeah, this is a little more than I need too,
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.440]  but I think it's gonna be a good time.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.960]  Kev, I will pass you this torch
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.680]  as soon as I get done with it and you can dab with us.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.680]  Feel free to help yourself to anything I got over here.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.280]  Right there, so.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.680]  I kind of foresaw that happening.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.800]  When you said King Louie, Kev lit up.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.760]  Little phase two hit man, shout out to Big D.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.320]  That was a kind of a, sort of a gift from Big D.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.560]  There may have been a trade involved,
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.800]  but we'll call it a gift.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.800]  Shout out to Big D, I hope you're doing well, man.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:53.960]  He's doing great.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.480]  He's doing great?
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  No, he's doing well.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.840]  He is well.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.520]  I hope so.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.400]  Trying to be grammatically correct.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.840]  Was he not quite great?
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.360]  I know, D's always been an amazing dude.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:07.200]  He's always doing quite well.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.600]  Okay, then the first one was grammatically correct.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:16.710]  You're just so high you thought you had to change it.
[01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:18.790]  Yeah, I just trying to not sound like a dipshit
[01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:20.670]  because I'm smoking a bunch of dope.
[01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.910]  All right, I gotta go in.
[01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:25.750]  Sound like a dope shit.
[01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:26.750]  I gotta go in kind of hot
[01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:29.150]  because this is a big crystal, so here I go.
[01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:30.830]  Sorry about all the silence on the podcast,
[01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:31.670]  you guys, we're taking dabs.
[01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:33.110]  Dab with us, please, thanks for joining us.
[01:48:33.110 --> 01:48:35.670]  Not that it sounds like a fucking NASA launch.
[01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:44.170]  Dabbing gorilla glue.
[01:48:44.170 --> 01:48:46.890]  Poor Kev with that fucking quarter inch thick banger.
[01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:53.930]  We shouldn't dab all at the same time next time.
[01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:55.530]  Oh, that tastes so good.
[01:48:56.490 --> 01:48:58.770]  Well, you guys gotta give me quite the head start
[01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.970]  before all of you dab at the same time.
[01:49:00.970 --> 01:49:02.810]  You gotta give me like two minutes.
[01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:05.410]  Yeah, Kev's nail is super thick, takes a long time.
[01:49:05.410 --> 01:49:07.130]  That gorilla glue, when you let that cool
[01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:09.450]  and hit that in just the right temperature,
[01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:10.630]  that is so delicious.
[01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:13.370]  Oh man, and it's just the high is coming over my head.
[01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:15.930]  It's kind of got my eyes going right now.
[01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:18.530]  I feel like I'm pulling my beanie down.
[01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:19.810]  That is super nice.
[01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:20.810]  Sounds awesome.
[01:49:21.930 --> 01:49:22.770]  You're what?
[01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:24.210]  Making me twitch a little bit.
[01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:27.410]  There goes Mike in a coffin to the mic.
[01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:29.210]  Mike on the mic, I'm gonna turn him down just a little bit.
[01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:31.850]  You guys, you don't wanna hear him die.
[01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:33.610]  What's up, Kev, you look scared.
[01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:34.970]  I'm not scared.
[01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:37.250]  I'm not scared.
[01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:39.010]  Why would I be scared?
[01:49:39.010 --> 01:49:41.010]  Waiting to see what you're gonna do to yourself
[01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:41.850]  with that dab.
[01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:43.850]  Oh, it's gonna hurt.
[01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:46.250]  It's gonna hurt in such a good way.
[01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:47.890]  I love those dabs that hurt.
[01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:49.370]  It's awesome after the hurt.
[01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:50.770]  It just goes away.
[01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:55.050]  Yeah, but that like, I have it right now where it's like,
[01:49:55.050 --> 01:49:56.890]  I gotta breathe properly or I'm not gonna breathe right.
[01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:57.730]  I enjoy that.
[01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:58.690]  It's like an adrenaline thing.
[01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:00.730]  It's almost like a tattoo.
[01:50:00.730 --> 01:50:03.010]  Similar, but not as, I don't know,
[01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:04.410]  some people might find it as intense.
[01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:06.010]  I'm a big dude and I take giant dabs
[01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:07.290]  and I've been doing it for a long time.
[01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:10.650]  If a normal non-dab connoisseur took that dab.
[01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:12.090]  It's not as long lasting.
[01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:12.930]  Yeah, but they would.
[01:50:12.930 --> 01:50:14.050]  Unless you're just getting like a.
[01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:16.250]  They do that arm thing, they swirl their arms around
[01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:18.050]  and they try to curl up into a little ball.
[01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:20.090]  They look at me like, what'd you just do to me?
[01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:21.490]  I know that move.
[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:24.130]  Yeah, I've given you those dabs several times.
[01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:25.650]  It's my pleasure, my friend.
[01:50:25.650 --> 01:50:27.290]  Thank you.
[01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:28.250]  Mike, you gonna be okay?
[01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:29.130]  I'll turn your mic back on.
[01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:29.970]  No, I'll be good.
[01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:31.370]  All right, oh, you sound fine.
[01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:33.130]  Yeah.
[01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:39.250]  As soon as I turned his mic on, he looks at me and coughs.
[01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.490]  Yeah, no, I'm still shaking it off.
[01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:41.570]  You guys, that was not a beer.
[01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:43.290]  That was a Mountain Dew that you heard.
[01:50:43.290 --> 01:50:45.050]  It sounded a lot like a Hank Hill beer.
[01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:46.970]  I wanted to hear the King of the Hill song.
[01:50:47.010 --> 01:50:50.130]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:50:50.130 --> 01:50:51.930]  Shout out to John Redcorn.
[01:50:51.930 --> 01:50:52.770]  What's up, John Redcorn?
[01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:54.850]  I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[01:50:54.850 --> 01:50:56.410]  Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:01.370]  Kev, that's a huge dab, dude, nice work.
[01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:02.850]  I like the way that that rig fits in your hand,
[01:51:02.850 --> 01:51:03.970]  like a goblet like that.
[01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:05.250]  That's fucking cool.
[01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:06.890]  Pretty smooth.
[01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:08.250]  It's got a little handle on it.
[01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:11.690]  It doesn't resemble a cognac sifter,
[01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:13.210]  but it's got that perch to it.
[01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:16.610]  So one of my favorite episodes,
[01:51:17.250 --> 01:51:18.090]  one of my favorite things that's ever happened
[01:51:18.090 --> 01:51:19.370]  on a podcast was not on this show.
[01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:21.010]  It was on 719 the Blocks.
[01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:25.410]  We talked about Siegfried and Roy,
[01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:29.410]  the flamboyant entertainers from Las Vegas,
[01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:31.450]  who one of them was attacked by a lion.
[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:34.410]  We spoke about this lion attack.
[01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:35.250]  Tiger?
[01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:38.650]  Yeah, it was a tiger, actually.
[01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:41.330]  You got eight so long ago, you done forgot the animal.
[01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:42.370]  I'm glad you corrected me,
[01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:44.730]  because it's a huge part of what I was gonna say.
[01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:46.090]  I've just been fucking up things
[01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:47.050]  on this podcast the whole time.
[01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:49.010]  We got way late, which is fine with me.
[01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:52.970]  We ended an episode of 719 the Blocks,
[01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:54.050]  and everybody said goodbye.
[01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:55.330]  We all said our we love you's,
[01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:56.930]  and I was like, all right, peace and love,
[01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:57.770]  we're gonna end the episode,
[01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:00.450]  and Kev goes, shout out to anyone that owns a tiger.
[01:52:01.690 --> 01:52:04.690]  Oh, dude, I totally forgot about that.
[01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:05.770]  That's awesome.
[01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:09.330]  That's one of my favorite clips ever from a podcast.
[01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:11.290]  Shout out to anybody that owns a tiger.
[01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:13.770]  It was fucking funny.
[01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:14.650]  I haven't said it in a long time.
[01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:15.770]  Shout out to the people.
[01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:16.610]  Yeah.
[01:52:16.610 --> 01:52:17.850]  And that was my last one.
[01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:19.450]  We talked about Siegfried and Roy
[01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:22.130]  getting eaten by their pet on that episode.
[01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:23.530]  Shout out to anyone that owns a tiger.
[01:52:23.530 --> 01:52:25.010]  That's always gonna be golden in my mind,
[01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:26.970]  so I think that was fucking dope.
[01:52:26.970 --> 01:52:29.490]  I totally forgot about that, dude.
[01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:30.330]  That's awesome.
[01:52:30.330 --> 01:52:34.170]  Somebody just sent me a, is this a gif?
[01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:35.530]  Yep, they just sent me a gif
[01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:39.930]  of the Spartans and the 300 number on there.
[01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:41.690]  Somebody knows what's up tonight.
[01:52:41.690 --> 01:52:43.290]  Shout out to the people sending me the 300.
[01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:46.570]  People know what's going on.
[01:52:46.570 --> 01:52:48.130]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:49.690]  you guys, you wanna start wrapping up this podcast?
[01:52:49.690 --> 01:52:51.850]  Kevin's yawning over there, Mike's alive.
[01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:52.690]  It's that time.
[01:52:52.690 --> 01:52:53.530]  It is that time.
[01:52:53.530 --> 01:52:54.370]  I need some food in my gut.
[01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:56.210]  Someone's bedtime is coming.
[01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:58.130]  Oh, shout out to the bedtime kid.
[01:52:58.130 --> 01:52:59.610]  Oh, snap, no, that already happened.
[01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:00.450]  I'm in trouble.
[01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:02.250]  Uh-oh, Mike's gonna be in trouble.
[01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:03.250]  Sorry to get you in trouble, Mike.
[01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:06.010]  Hey, Mike's family, thanks for letting me hang out
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:07.250]  and steal your husband for a little while.
[01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:09.210]  Thanks for letting me borrow your daddy for a minute.
[01:53:09.210 --> 01:53:12.410]  He did a very good podcast, so give him a high five.
[01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:13.290]  Good job, Mike.
[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:16.730]  Hearing you use that word to refer to me, fuck my head.
[01:53:17.730 --> 01:53:19.170]  But I'm good.
[01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:21.050]  You were a good husband and a good father, Mike.
[01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:22.090]  It's okay.
[01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:22.930]  We can see those things.
[01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:23.770]  Gracias, I try.
[01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:25.610]  You handle things well.
[01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:27.370]  Just don't call me daddy.
[01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:30.490]  No, I was referring to like, no, I wasn't saying.
[01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:32.450]  The relationship I have with my son, no, I got it.
[01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:33.650]  It just don't fuck my head.
[01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:35.570]  Yeah, I'm not calling you daddy, big guy.
[01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:37.570]  Yeah, it's like, please don't.
[01:53:37.570 --> 01:53:40.210]  Yeah, that's more awkward than I'm ready to get.
[01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:41.690]  I'm all down with weird every day.
[01:53:41.890 --> 01:53:42.730]  I thought you thought you're done
[01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:43.890]  with having to make edits.
[01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:45.370]  Jesus, no, I'm gonna leave that in.
[01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:46.210]  You're fucking crazy.
[01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.890]  That's good, that's gold.
[01:53:47.890 --> 01:53:50.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out with us.
[01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:51.250]  This was episode number 300.
[01:53:51.250 --> 01:53:52.210]  I don't know what you expected.
[01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:54.170]  I don't know what I expected, but I know what we got
[01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:55.290]  and I fucking had a good time.
[01:53:55.290 --> 01:53:56.330]  I hope everybody here at the table
[01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:57.490]  had as much fun as I did.
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:59.410]  Absolutely, thank you for having me again, man.
[01:53:59.410 --> 01:54:00.250]  Oh, anytime, dude.
[01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:03.010]  Anytime you wanna come be on a podcast, let me know.
[01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:06.810]  We will keep the listeners updated on your sobriety here.
[01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:08.610]  If you ever need support with that, bro, you can call me.
[01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:09.570]  You can call Mike anytime.
[01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:10.570]  I think you already know that.
[01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:11.410]  Appreciate it.
[01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:13.210]  I'm sure I don't think it's gonna be necessary,
[01:54:13.210 --> 01:54:14.650]  but you know, whenever.
[01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:17.050]  You've been tested and you've won.
[01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.490]  Two other cannabis only guys that you know
[01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:20.810]  and get along with and you know
[01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:22.330]  we probably have good hash, so.
[01:54:24.450 --> 01:54:26.210]  There's like 11 reasons to call you.
[01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:29.730]  You can call for reasons other than sobriety or podcast.
[01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:31.450]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:32.290]  Word.
[01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:33.970]  Mike, you can come be on the show whenever.
[01:54:33.970 --> 01:54:34.810]  Yeah, whenever you just need to get away.
[01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:37.170]  Dude, I would be over here way more often
[01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:39.850]  if I could get away, so I'm trying to build this
[01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:41.370]  into a more structured schedule,
[01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:43.490]  but we'll see how that goes.
[01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:44.330]  LOL.
[01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:46.970]  Yeah, with children, that's what I said isn't a thing.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:47.810]  LOL.
[01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:49.370]  Those of you that have kids understand.
[01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:51.130]  Those of you that don't have kids.
[01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:51.970]  You'll find out soon enough.
[01:54:51.970 --> 01:54:52.970]  You'll get it eventually.
[01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:54.330]  Yeah, all right, podcast world.
[01:54:54.330 --> 01:54:56.730]  Make sure you stalk everybody on all the proper social media
[01:54:56.730 --> 01:55:00.890]  elevated concentrations, elevated concentrations for Kevin.
[01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:02.650]  Find white Mike at Pueblo
[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.370]  for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:07.130]  He's Nemo Punk 15 on the other social medias
[01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:08.090]  that start with an at.
[01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:09.250]  You'll be able to find him.
[01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:10.530]  Of course, find me on Facebook.
[01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:12.450]  Search for IRI Genetics on Instagram.
[01:55:12.450 --> 01:55:13.530]  I use my other company name.
[01:55:13.530 --> 01:55:15.050]  It's IRI underscore genetics.
[01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:17.250]  I invite you to follow me on Instagram
[01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:19.170]  because I do Instagram live feeds.
[01:55:19.170 --> 01:55:20.210]  I go talk to my audience.
[01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:21.250]  You guys can throw me questions.
[01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.690]  I will answer them live right there.
[01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:23.530]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:55:23.530 --> 01:55:24.730]  I've made a lot of new friends.
[01:55:24.730 --> 01:55:26.930]  Kind of stay at home a lot.
[01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:27.770]  I don't like to go out,
[01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:30.170]  so that's kind of my social interaction.
[01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:31.530]  Find me there, hang out.
[01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:32.370]  You'll love it.
[01:55:32.370 --> 01:55:33.190]  Also find me on Twitter.
[01:55:33.190 --> 01:55:34.450]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[01:55:34.450 --> 01:55:38.250]  Don't forget on YouTube, there are 200 videos available.
[01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:41.730]  You can see the old 200 episodes on YouTube.
[01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:42.570]  Check it out.
[01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:43.490]  I think you will enjoy it.
[01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:45.170]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[01:55:45.170 --> 01:55:46.610]  if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[01:55:46.610 --> 01:55:47.610]  or if you've got something to say
[01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:49.170]  and you're not into all the social media stuff,
[01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:50.290]  you can send me an email.
[01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:52.530]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:54.330]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:55:54.330 --> 01:55:55.770]  Once again, don't forget about Patreon.
[01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:56.810]  Mike did a good job earlier.
[01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:57.890]  I want to remind you once again,
[01:55:57.890 --> 01:56:00.690]  patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:03.090]  It's a way to financially contribute to the podcast.
[01:56:03.090 --> 01:56:05.090]  Not begging, just looking for support.
[01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:06.450]  Need a new MacBook?
[01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:07.410]  SOS.
[01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:08.770]  Almost though, it's going slow, you guys.
[01:56:08.770 --> 01:56:09.610]  It's kind of scary.
[01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:13.450]  It did eat itself twice as often as it normally does today.
[01:56:13.450 --> 01:56:14.850]  Yes, it's been a long recording.
[01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:16.330]  Those of you that have been contributing,
[01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:17.570]  double thank you right now,
[01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:19.850]  because that money is going to a real worthy cause.
[01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:21.930]  True, without the MacBook, there is no podcast,
[01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:22.770]  so thank you.
[01:56:23.690 --> 01:56:25.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the episode,
[01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:26.730]  I usually do, oh, you know what?
[01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:28.130]  We didn't mention we're going to talk about things
[01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:28.970]  in the future.
[01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:30.010]  I'm going to breed more lemon Jeffrey seeds.
[01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:30.850]  We got to say that.
[01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:31.670]  That's why I wrote that down.
[01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:32.510]  We didn't say that.
[01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:33.350]  That's coming in the future.
[01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:34.370]  But I want to give a huge shout out.
[01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:36.530]  I usually do a shout out to one individual person.
[01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:37.610]  I want to say all the stuff about,
[01:56:37.610 --> 01:56:39.010]  I'll be back on Thursday.
[01:56:39.010 --> 01:56:40.050]  Check out the mini episodes.
[01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.770]  I'll be back Monday with another fresh episode.
[01:56:41.770 --> 01:56:43.890]  Thanks to all the sponsors, contributors,
[01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:45.650]  the guests, everybody.
[01:56:45.650 --> 01:56:49.250]  Then usually I say a huge shout out to a specific person.
[01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:52.150]  This time, if you hear this, shout out.
[01:56:52.150 --> 01:56:53.290]  Thank you for the support.
[01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:54.690]  300 episodes.
[01:56:54.690 --> 01:56:57.390]  There's no reason to do 300 episodes of a podcast
[01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:58.930]  without a loyal audience.
[01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:00.610]  That would be schizophrenia or some shit
[01:57:00.610 --> 01:57:01.450]  if I kept doing it without a listener.
[01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:03.810]  Without an audience, you're just a crazy person
[01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.650]  with a computer.
[01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.750]  Yeah, with a lot of fancy expensive toys.
[01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.930]  Yeah, that's what I thought as well.
[01:57:07.930 --> 01:57:10.330]  So you guys, you are proving that I am not
[01:57:10.330 --> 01:57:11.390]  completely insane.
[01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:12.230]  So thank you for that.
[01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:14.690]  But honestly, dude, 300 episodes.
[01:57:14.690 --> 01:57:15.530]  Thank you.
[01:57:15.530 --> 01:57:16.350]  That means a lot to me.
[01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:18.710]  You guys have been outpouring support.
[01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:20.070]  My social media explodes.
[01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:21.530]  My email explodes.
[01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:23.870]  The YouTube channel has been getting views and comments.
[01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:27.490]  The podcast has been getting downloads on all platforms.
[01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:28.930]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:31.410]  This little show that started here at this kitchen table
[01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:32.730]  is making a difference.
[01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:34.170]  And I didn't know I could even do that.
[01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:36.730]  I wanted to put out some advice that was true
[01:57:36.730 --> 01:57:37.610]  and I'm making a difference.
[01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:38.450]  So thank you.
[01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:39.950]  It wouldn't be a difference without you guys
[01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:40.970]  actually doing it.
[01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:44.530]  I love that we're achieving,
[01:57:44.530 --> 01:57:46.930]  or you're achieving the goal you set originally
[01:57:46.930 --> 01:57:48.810]  in such a fashion now.
[01:57:48.810 --> 01:57:51.890]  Like I never saw it getting this big
[01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:54.170]  and or going this long.
[01:57:54.170 --> 01:57:56.530]  And to see that how many people this has helped
[01:57:56.530 --> 01:57:58.050]  is just fucking awesome.
[01:57:58.050 --> 01:57:59.370]  Better weed coast to coast.
[01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:00.290]  Thanks to you.
[01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:02.010]  For all over the place.
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:04.130]  Not just coast to coast, worldwide.
[01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:06.050]  We're getting people that listen in the UK,
[01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:09.450]  people in Australia, people all over the place
[01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:10.290]  listen to us.
[01:58:10.290 --> 01:58:11.790]  Some of our sponsors are located,
[01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:13.370]  their home bases are in other countries.
[01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:16.370]  So we're doing it all over the place.
[01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:17.210]  So thank you guys,
[01:58:17.210 --> 01:58:18.830]  because you guys bring more audience.
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:20.130]  Like Kev's people are gonna listen.
[01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:21.370]  Your people are gonna listen.
[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:22.210]  So that's awesome.
[01:58:22.210 --> 01:58:23.030]  Thank you.
[01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:24.250]  Some interesting people in my world have been like,
[01:58:24.250 --> 01:58:26.410]  don't you go on a show from time to time?
[01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:27.650]  Can I get that info?
[01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:28.850]  Yeah.
[01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:29.850]  Then they're gonna share it
[01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:31.850]  with some interesting people as well.
[01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:32.690]  So thank you guys.
[01:58:32.690 --> 01:58:34.610]  Everybody that listens to the show, thank you.
[01:58:34.610 --> 01:58:35.450]  Like I said earlier,
[01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:37.530]  I would just be schizophrenic or something
[01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:38.850]  if I didn't have an audience.
[01:58:38.850 --> 01:58:39.970]  So I appreciate it.
[01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:41.850]  I wouldn't, it would be kind of strange to do this
[01:58:41.850 --> 01:58:43.090]  without all of your support.
[01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:43.930]  I love you guys.
[01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:45.450]  Thank you for listening to 300 episodes.
[01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:49.010]  I promise to keep delivering you quality content.
[01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:51.930]  As long as this computer and this production equipment works
[01:58:51.930 --> 01:58:54.610]  and my brain and my throat will all function properly,
[01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:55.930]  I'm gonna keep putting out podcasts.
[01:58:55.930 --> 01:58:57.610]  As long as Mike promises to keep coming over,
[01:58:57.610 --> 01:58:58.810]  I'll keep having him on.
[01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:00.450]  Kev, same with you, bro.
[01:59:00.450 --> 01:59:02.570]  You don't even have to have dads, just show up, dude.
[01:59:03.450 --> 01:59:04.490]  Just be like, hey, I'm ready.
[01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:06.610]  We'll do a podcast if you get an idea.
[01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:10.010]  Also, you guys, I love doing the listener generated content.
[01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:11.170]  When you send me emails and you say,
[01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:12.810]  hey, Ross and Jeff, my plants are doing this.
[01:59:12.810 --> 01:59:14.290]  My grow room's doing this.
[01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.130]  I need some help.
[01:59:15.130 --> 01:59:16.250]  Please help me out.
[01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:19.370]  That lets me know that I can help somebody.
[01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:21.570]  And I'm sure that if you're having that problem,
[01:59:21.570 --> 01:59:23.210]  if one dude in Texas has a problem,
[01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:25.970]  that means that a dude in Iowa, Alabama, Kansas,
[01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:28.290]  and Louisiana probably have a similar problem
[01:59:28.290 --> 01:59:30.210]  and they just haven't bothered to email me yet
[01:59:30.210 --> 01:59:31.130]  or they were going to.
[01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:33.210]  That's why I like the email show so much.
[01:59:33.210 --> 01:59:34.890]  It lets me know that I'm hitting a target
[01:59:34.890 --> 01:59:37.850]  instead of just blabbering, maybe this is a good idea.
[01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:40.090]  Like it lets me know I'm actually getting my idea out
[01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:41.530]  to at least one person.
[01:59:41.530 --> 01:59:43.890]  And like I said, if one person has that problem,
[01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:45.890]  a lot of people, we had a hundred thousand people
[01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:46.970]  listen to an episode.
[01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:49.410]  I had to have helped 20,000 people
[01:59:49.410 --> 01:59:51.210]  with the proper thing that week, maybe.
[01:59:51.210 --> 01:59:52.090]  I don't know.
[01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:53.330]  Somebody learned something.
[01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:54.170]  That's what I want to do.
[01:59:54.170 --> 01:59:55.010]  Teach you guys right.
[01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.830]  Keep you going.
[01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:56.670]  Keep your gardens growing strong.
[01:59:56.670 --> 01:59:58.170]  Make everybody grow better cannabis,
[01:59:58.170 --> 01:59:59.530]  safer, cleaner cannabis,
[01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:02.530]  so that patients and recreational smokers can stay healthy
[02:00:02.530 --> 02:00:05.650]  and enjoy the product the way it was meant to be.
[02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:07.730]  Holy crap, I'm rambling from those dabs.
[02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:08.890]  Let's wrap up a podcast.
[02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:09.730]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:00:09.730 --> 02:00:11.730]  shout out to everybody that listens to the show.
[02:00:11.730 --> 02:00:13.650]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:15.210]  and give your mom a hug for me.
