[00:15.740 --> 00:18.240]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:18.240 --> 00:20.200]  It's time for episode number 277
[00:20.200 --> 00:22.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.780]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.780 --> 00:26.920]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.920 --> 00:28.180]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.180 --> 00:30.640]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.640 --> 00:32.260]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.260 --> 00:33.840]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.840 --> 00:35.760]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.760 --> 00:38.620]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.620 --> 00:40.480]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.440]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.560]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.600 --> 00:46.180]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.180 --> 00:48.680]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.680 --> 00:50.360]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:50.360 --> 00:52.820]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.460 --> 00:56.240]  Hey Mike, are you all right over there, bro?
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.080]  Yep.
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.000]  I just gave Mike a dab.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.720]  Well, Mike gave himself a dab.
[00:59.720 --> 01:04.480]  And he's purple, pink, yellow.
[01:04.480 --> 01:06.600]  He tried to lean into the mic and say some shit,
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.460]  and all that came out was, I hum-rum-rum.
[01:09.460 --> 01:10.480]  It hit the right spots.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.880]  That dab hit the right spots.
[01:11.880 --> 01:14.440]  It looks like it hit you in the face.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.120]  That was one of the spots.
[01:16.120 --> 01:17.840]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17.840 --> 01:18.680]  What up, everybody?
[01:18.680 --> 01:19.520]  I am not abusing Mike.
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.400]  We are hanging out.
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.280]  It looks like Mike got beat up by a dab just now.
[01:23.280 --> 01:24.120]  Are you good, bro?
[01:24.120 --> 01:24.940]  Should we leave your mic on,
[01:24.940 --> 01:25.780]  or do you want me to turn it back off for a minute?
[01:25.780 --> 01:26.620]  Should be good.
[01:26.620 --> 01:27.440]  All right, all right.
[01:27.440 --> 01:29.080]  Welcome to the show.
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.640]  So let's start off by,
[01:30.640 --> 01:32.360]  since Mike just took a big dab and is talking,
[01:32.360 --> 01:33.480]  welcome to the show, Mike.
[01:33.480 --> 01:34.480]  Thanks, man.
[01:34.480 --> 01:36.480]  Do you want to share your social media with everybody
[01:36.480 --> 01:37.560]  so that they can stalk you
[01:37.560 --> 01:39.640]  while they listen to your handsome voice?
[01:39.640 --> 01:40.960]  If you wanna find me on social media,
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.880]  you can check me out on Twitter at atnemopunk15,
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.880]  or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:48.880 --> 01:50.720]  Yeah, I like to challenge you right after you take a dab.
[01:50.720 --> 01:53.040]  Make sure the brains and lungs are working.
[01:53.040 --> 01:53.880]  Put you to the test.
[01:53.880 --> 01:55.000]  It didn't feel like the lungs were gonna make it
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.160]  through all of that sentence, but they made it.
[01:58.160 --> 01:59.480]  Congrats, you made it.
[01:59.480 --> 02:00.360]  Made it.
[02:00.360 --> 02:03.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a bonus episode.
[02:03.040 --> 02:03.880]  Bonus.
[02:03.880 --> 02:04.720]  Bonus.
[02:04.720 --> 02:05.540]  We're putting out another episode.
[02:05.540 --> 02:07.080]  This is, since I numbered at 277,
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.520]  it's gonna have to come out before Thursday,
[02:08.520 --> 02:10.920]  because Thursday, I think, is 278.
[02:11.760 --> 02:13.160]  If I'm paying attention to the numbers correctly.
[02:13.160 --> 02:16.040]  So, happy bonus episode, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16.040 --> 02:18.120]  It's always a good week when we got two episodes
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.320]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:19.320 --> 02:22.520]  Well, this'll be three, because we got the Thursday show,
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.520]  the Monday show, and the bonus white mic episode.
[02:25.520 --> 02:26.360]  Woo.
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.600]  Hey, big shout out to everybody that just hung out
[02:27.600 --> 02:28.760]  with us on Instagram Live.
[02:28.760 --> 02:30.600]  If you're not following me on Instagram Live,
[02:30.600 --> 02:31.600]  I encourage you to do so.
[02:31.600 --> 02:32.760]  Go to Instagram and search for me.
[02:32.760 --> 02:35.860]  It's irie, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[02:35.860 --> 02:36.700]  Check us out.
[02:36.700 --> 02:38.400]  You can interact with Instagram Live feeds.
[02:38.400 --> 02:40.680]  I actually wrote down a couple of notes from the Live feed
[02:41.440 --> 02:43.280]  that will become podcast material.
[02:43.280 --> 02:44.120]  So, come hang out.
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.440]  Good questions today.
[02:45.440 --> 02:47.840]  Yeah, yeah, ask some questions, leave some comments,
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.960]  and interact with me.
[02:48.960 --> 02:50.680]  I do appreciate the interaction.
[02:50.680 --> 02:52.440]  All right, I usually like to start the podcast off
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.280]  by telling you guys what we're smoking on.
[02:54.280 --> 02:56.320]  Mike, what did you just take a dab over there, bro?
[02:56.320 --> 02:58.520]  That was some Footloose from Apothecary.
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.220]  Some Footloose batter.
[03:00.220 --> 03:02.080]  That stuff was stinky.
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.240]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[03:03.240 --> 03:04.920]  It's wonderful.
[03:04.920 --> 03:05.760]  He's just lit.
[03:05.760 --> 03:07.040]  He's thinking about ways to describe it,
[03:07.040 --> 03:08.880]  and wonderful is all he's fucking got for us.
[03:09.400 --> 03:11.560]  Really nice body high, not a whole lot of head high.
[03:11.560 --> 03:14.440]  Didn't want to get too jumbled for this week's show,
[03:14.440 --> 03:17.520]  but can't go with no hash.
[03:17.520 --> 03:18.600]  That's the truth.
[03:18.600 --> 03:19.440]  Cannot go with no hash.
[03:19.440 --> 03:20.560]  It's not that kind of show.
[03:20.560 --> 03:23.240]  I took a big old fat dab of Glucinda,
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.580]  which is Gorilla Glue number four with Lucinda Williams.
[03:26.580 --> 03:28.720]  It's batter from Apothecary.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.840]  When I say batter, it's kind of like you took off
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.320]  a little piece of cream cheese or cheesecake,
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.320]  and just cut a little bit of piece of that off.
[03:35.320 --> 03:37.480]  And then I like to smoke the high cannabinoid
[03:37.480 --> 03:39.520]  full spectrum extract crystals,
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.360]  but it's hard to get them to stay on the dabber.
[03:41.360 --> 03:44.480]  So I roll some of the, I just take the dab of the Glucinda
[03:44.480 --> 03:47.760]  and just gently roll it across the Sour Joker
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.540]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[03:49.540 --> 03:51.640]  and it picks up a few crystals for me.
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.160]  I take a big dab of that, and it does a really good job.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.920]  Mike was like, do you want another dab before the show?
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.000]  And I was like, no, I think I'm fucking good for a minute.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.280]  Like, I don't need another dab.
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.420]  I want to be cool.
[04:01.420 --> 04:03.360]  But yeah, big shout out to our friends at Apothecary
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.800]  for the quality concentrates.
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.680]  I've also got some, this is called Vishnu.
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.440]  When I picked this up out at STEM Beach,
[04:11.440 --> 04:13.000]  they took it out of the original container
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.240]  and put it in this container for me.
[04:14.240 --> 04:15.720]  They asked if it was okay first.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.920]  They have to send you out in a childproof container,
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.440]  and the other container was not childproof.
[04:19.440 --> 04:20.300]  So I got this one instead.
[04:20.300 --> 04:22.560]  I don't remember, maybe it says on here
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.960]  the name of the company, CRX.
[04:24.960 --> 04:27.400]  Some CRX Shatter, some Vishnu.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.240]  It's not bad.
[04:28.240 --> 04:30.520]  I picked it up over at Doctor's Order at STEM Beach.
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.880]  Shout out to my friends out there doing good work.
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.200]  Mike, you looked like you were gonna say something
[04:36.200 --> 04:37.360]  and you just changed your mind.
[04:37.360 --> 04:39.560]  You're like, no, I'm not gonna say anything.
[04:39.560 --> 04:40.880]  I'm high over here.
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.600]  All right, we covered your social media.
[04:42.600 --> 04:44.840]  We talked about what we're smoking on.
[04:44.840 --> 04:47.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you pay any attention to the world,
[04:47.320 --> 04:48.800]  we're probably a little bit late,
[04:48.800 --> 04:51.600]  but let's talk a little bit about the announcement
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.640]  that was made by Mr. Jeff Sessions.
[04:54.640 --> 04:57.400]  That's the point of the bonus episode, folks,
[04:57.400 --> 05:01.360]  is a special show focused around this topic.
[05:01.360 --> 05:04.160]  If you follow cannabis news at all,
[05:04.160 --> 05:05.640]  you definitely heard the news
[05:05.640 --> 05:08.600]  that our Attorney General Jeff Sessions
[05:08.600 --> 05:11.680]  has rescinded the Cole Memo,
[05:11.680 --> 05:14.000]  which gave some legal protection
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.960]  to recreational cannabis businesses
[05:16.960 --> 05:20.880]  in states that have legalized recreational use cannabis.
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.240]  So we've said a lot of things in just a couple of sentences.
[05:23.240 --> 05:25.120]  Right, there was a lot of information there.
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.520]  I've got a list of kind of things
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.080]  that we need to keep in mind.
[05:28.080 --> 05:31.120]  Will you briefly explain to us the Cole Memo?
[05:31.880 --> 05:33.080]  Because this all stems from the Cole Memo.
[05:33.080 --> 05:38.080]  Okay, so when Obama took office,
[05:38.360 --> 05:42.320]  there was no federal guidance on state medical marijuana
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.680]  or recreational marijuana laws.
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.880]  We were just sort of operating in the face of federal law
[05:49.880 --> 05:51.680]  and waiting to see what happened.
[05:53.440 --> 05:58.440]  Two pieces of legislation have evolved since then,
[05:59.200 --> 06:01.080]  one of which is the Cole Memo.
[06:02.120 --> 06:06.560]  Cole was Attorney General for a while under Obama,
[06:06.560 --> 06:08.920]  and he wrote a memo basically
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.280]  to all of his federal Attorney General prosecutors.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.040]  I think there's like 93 or 100 of them
[06:14.040 --> 06:15.680]  or something around the US,
[06:15.680 --> 06:19.720]  saying if you operate in a district
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.960]  that covers a legal marijuana state,
[06:22.960 --> 06:26.160]  here are some guidelines for federal enforcement.
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.920]  Don't bother wasting money
[06:28.360 --> 06:30.680]  if the business is following state law.
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.480]  Instead, focus on diversion out of state,
[06:35.480 --> 06:37.240]  diversion to minors,
[06:38.520 --> 06:41.920]  shenanigans with banking rules and regulations,
[06:41.920 --> 06:42.760]  that sort of thing.
[06:42.760 --> 06:44.360]  There were eight points to the Cole Memo.
[06:44.360 --> 06:47.160]  You can pull this up if you'd like.
[06:47.160 --> 06:51.640]  But basically, it's the thin little paper shield
[06:51.640 --> 06:54.840]  the legal marijuana industry has been using
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.440]  to really thrive coast to coast.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.880]  It was the federal document
[06:59.880 --> 07:02.480]  the industry would look to and point to
[07:02.480 --> 07:04.560]  to say we're doing the best we can,
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.240]  trying to comply with what the feds want
[07:07.240 --> 07:09.080]  to see out of legal marijuana.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.240]  It's what states that have passed legal marijuana
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.040]  have used to kind of guide their own rules and regulations.
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.160]  It's part of the reason Colorado right now
[07:21.160 --> 07:24.560]  is really going after the medical market.
[07:24.560 --> 07:26.600]  It's because our legislatures have decided
[07:26.600 --> 07:29.800]  that our medical marijuana loopholes
[07:31.360 --> 07:33.840]  are feeding that gray and black market
[07:33.840 --> 07:35.560]  out of state diversion.
[07:35.560 --> 07:37.480]  And that's one of the Cole Memo points
[07:37.480 --> 07:40.880]  that really brings down federal intervention
[07:40.880 --> 07:43.160]  is when stuff's going out of state.
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.320]  And so the Cole Memo, it's literally just that,
[07:46.320 --> 07:47.480]  it's a memo.
[07:47.480 --> 07:50.440]  It's not a law that was voted on or passed.
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.920]  It's not part of any official set of rules.
[07:53.920 --> 07:58.040]  It's just an official guideline basically
[07:58.040 --> 08:00.600]  for the federal enforcement of marijuana laws.
[08:00.600 --> 08:01.960]  Couple of bosses talked and said,
[08:01.960 --> 08:04.240]  hey, that employee sucks, watch him.
[08:04.240 --> 08:05.320]  Kind of. There's no note made.
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.160]  Or there was a note.
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.320]  There's a note between two employees.
[08:07.320 --> 08:10.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's not official.
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.480]  It wasn't.
[08:11.480 --> 08:13.640]  There was a note but not an email?
[08:13.640 --> 08:15.000]  Kind of.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.360]  Well, it went out in a very official way.
[08:18.440 --> 08:23.440]  It was released as how the Obama administration
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.640]  would choose to spend federal resources coast to coast.
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.000]  There's a limited amount of money
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.800]  that the feds have to do anything.
[08:32.800 --> 08:35.480]  There's a limited number of people in man hours
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.600]  and they can't go after everybody who's breaking every rule.
[08:39.600 --> 08:41.880]  And so they have to pick and choose.
[08:41.880 --> 08:46.040]  And yes, it would be easy for states, federal prosecutors
[08:46.040 --> 08:51.040]  to just round up large numbers of legal marijuana employees
[08:51.560 --> 08:54.680]  and say, look at me, they're breaking federal law.
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.520]  But that wouldn't be a good use of their time,
[08:57.520 --> 09:02.060]  their man hours, all of that effort, money, courtroom time.
[09:02.060 --> 09:03.560]  All of that could go to things
[09:03.560 --> 09:05.800]  like an interstate sex trafficking ring.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.760]  But instead you went after the stores
[09:07.760 --> 09:09.040]  that were following state rules.
[09:09.040 --> 09:10.260]  That's a bad idea.
[09:10.260 --> 09:12.420]  It was just a memo that said don't bother.
[09:13.680 --> 09:15.920]  This is why if you've been listening to the show
[09:15.920 --> 09:19.600]  for a while, especially leading up to last year's election,
[09:19.640 --> 09:21.880]  I really, really, really pushed listeners
[09:21.880 --> 09:24.240]  to get involved, get registered to vote,
[09:24.240 --> 09:27.360]  start going to local governance meetings,
[09:27.360 --> 09:29.360]  at least start reading the politics section
[09:29.360 --> 09:32.140]  of the newspaper, start getting caught up
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.500]  on some of this stuff because the protections
[09:35.500 --> 09:39.020]  that are in place for this massive legal marijuana industry
[09:39.020 --> 09:43.640]  that we're building coast to coast are not set in stone.
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.040]  One of them's a memo and one of them's an amendment
[09:46.040 --> 09:47.680]  in a spending bill and we'll talk about that
[09:47.680 --> 09:48.800]  in a little bit.
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.680]  The Cole memo was just that.
[09:50.680 --> 09:52.360]  It was just a guidance memo.
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.480]  We've been expecting, people like me have been expecting
[09:58.480 --> 10:00.280]  our Attorney General Jeff Sessions
[10:00.280 --> 10:03.760]  to rescind this for months now.
[10:03.760 --> 10:06.720]  He hates marijuana.
[10:06.720 --> 10:08.680]  Most people hate cancer.
[10:08.680 --> 10:11.680]  Jeff Sessions hates marijuana a little bit more
[10:11.680 --> 10:13.160]  than most people hate cancer.
[10:14.120 --> 10:17.720]  You can pull up all sorts of crazy quotes
[10:17.720 --> 10:19.080]  from him about marijuana.
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.200]  The big one that's making the rounds right now
[10:21.200 --> 10:24.720]  is good people don't smoke marijuana.
[10:24.720 --> 10:27.680]  That's one of his one-liners that he's said
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.560]  a couple of times and has really been picked up
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.960]  and reposted.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.780]  Colorado is a bad person.
[10:34.240 --> 10:37.800]  So the Cole memo basically said don't spend money
[10:37.800 --> 10:39.680]  on bothering cannabis businesses
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.640]  if the business is doing things legitimately.
[10:41.640 --> 10:43.700]  If they're legit, let them keep doing their thing.
[10:43.700 --> 10:46.240]  Refocus your funds and energy on other things.
[10:46.240 --> 10:49.660]  Mike decided to go with sex trafficking on the highway.
[10:49.660 --> 10:50.500]  Yeah.
[10:50.500 --> 10:52.600]  No interstate, not on the interstate.
[10:52.600 --> 10:54.840]  Okay, yeah, well anyway.
[10:54.840 --> 10:56.520]  Mike wants you to clean up the sex trafficking,
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.360]  which makes sense.
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.180]  Do that.
[10:58.180 --> 11:00.640]  Stop busting potheads, work on prostitution rings
[11:00.640 --> 11:03.080]  and child slavery and child sex trafficking.
[11:03.080 --> 11:03.920]  That's terrible.
[11:03.920 --> 11:05.400]  There's way more harm than that.
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.240]  Fix that.
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.440]  So this basically protected the marijuana industry,
[11:10.440 --> 11:12.200]  but it wasn't a rule or a law.
[11:12.200 --> 11:14.360]  It was just, hey, let's not fuck with them.
[11:14.360 --> 11:16.040]  Let's spend our money somewhere else.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.720]  Mike says that there's more to that
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.560]  that we're gonna talk about in a minute,
[11:19.560 --> 11:21.760]  but that is the gist of the Cole memo.
[11:21.760 --> 11:25.440]  That sets us up to go to the next step of what happened.
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.820]  This asshole named Jeff Sessions
[11:26.820 --> 11:28.260]  gets involved in our government,
[11:28.260 --> 11:31.420]  and then he says, no more Cole memo.
[11:31.420 --> 11:32.700]  Fuck those weed heads.
[11:32.700 --> 11:33.540]  Is that accurate?
[11:33.540 --> 11:35.360]  He didn't say that, but basically he came out
[11:35.360 --> 11:37.040]  and gave us all a big middle finger.
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.140]  He uses close to terminology that he's allowed to.
[11:42.200 --> 11:45.800]  Like I said, he really hates cannabis in all forms
[11:46.560 --> 11:47.960]  and for all reasons.
[11:47.960 --> 11:50.760]  As far as he's concerned, this is an evil plot
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.080]  perpetrated with the goal of destroying America.
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.080]  And he's really invested in reversing marijuana policy
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.800]  coast to coast back to about 1990.
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.820]  Like that's his sweet spot in marijuana policy.
[12:10.880 --> 12:13.880]  No one really wants to see that other than him
[12:13.920 --> 12:16.040]  and a handful of hardcore anti-pop people.
[12:16.040 --> 12:18.380]  Right, and they all live in the same house.
[12:18.380 --> 12:20.520]  So this week he came out and said,
[12:20.520 --> 12:23.440]  we're gonna go ahead and officially rescind
[12:23.440 --> 12:25.160]  or cancel this memo.
[12:26.040 --> 12:30.560]  And that federal prosecutors will now go back
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.400]  to following just federal law as written
[12:34.400 --> 12:35.960]  when it comes to the enforcement
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.760]  of the Controlled Substances Act.
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.100]  And quote, that was basically his directive.
[12:42.100 --> 12:47.100]  And this had a lot of kind of immediate effects,
[12:48.220 --> 12:50.460]  but not the ones that the anti-pop crowd
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.500]  has been hoping for.
[12:52.340 --> 12:55.180]  So that's what I've got written is what happens next.
[12:55.180 --> 12:58.300]  The anti-pop crowd hopes that Trump waves a flag,
[12:58.300 --> 13:00.700]  the army comes in, they kick down the dispensary door,
[13:00.700 --> 13:02.020]  they arrest us, they detain us,
[13:02.020 --> 13:03.860]  they put us in FEMA camps, they come to the GRO,
[13:03.860 --> 13:04.940]  they clean up the GRO, they destroy all the plants.
[13:04.940 --> 13:06.860]  I've already read a couple of posts
[13:06.860 --> 13:08.860]  where they're like, why isn't the DEA
[13:08.860 --> 13:12.020]  arresting people yet from that crowd?
[13:12.740 --> 13:14.060]  And that's not at all what's gonna happen.
[13:14.060 --> 13:16.900]  So if you were wondering if that's what's gonna happen next,
[13:16.900 --> 13:20.040]  that's not what's gonna happen next.
[13:22.340 --> 13:27.340]  This is kind of an attack or a swipe aimed at investors.
[13:28.620 --> 13:30.220]  California was just about to,
[13:30.220 --> 13:31.820]  or just came online on Monday,
[13:31.820 --> 13:34.620]  and I think this happened Wednesday or Thursday.
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.220]  So all of the people who were waiting to see
[13:38.220 --> 13:39.820]  how the rollout of California's
[13:39.820 --> 13:41.500]  illegal marijuana business went
[13:42.860 --> 13:46.460]  before really jumping in with both feet investment-wise
[13:46.460 --> 13:49.180]  have now had somebody from the federal government say,
[13:49.180 --> 13:50.500]  you might not want to.
[13:51.500 --> 13:54.220]  And likely one of the immediate repercussions
[13:54.220 --> 13:57.460]  of this move by Attorney General Sessions
[13:57.460 --> 14:02.460]  is that investment in newly emerging marijuana markets
[14:02.980 --> 14:04.260]  is gonna be a lot slower.
[14:05.860 --> 14:09.660]  For California, this is especially kind of problematic
[14:10.500 --> 14:13.500]  because of how their rollout is scheduled to progress.
[14:13.500 --> 14:17.780]  Huge amounts of California have passed bans
[14:17.780 --> 14:20.540]  on legal marijuana businesses
[14:20.540 --> 14:24.020]  until the state rolls out rules and regs
[14:24.020 --> 14:29.020]  and spells out what local municipalities can weigh in on.
[14:29.020 --> 14:31.940]  And then the local area will pass their rules
[14:31.940 --> 14:34.340]  and then they'll allow the industry.
[14:34.340 --> 14:36.340]  And so we've only hit that first step yet.
[14:36.340 --> 14:39.300]  California said, here's what we're gonna require.
[14:39.940 --> 14:42.140]  And that's just now starting to come online.
[14:42.140 --> 14:44.740]  A few areas in California have already jumped on it
[14:44.740 --> 14:47.060]  and said, we're gonna allow this from day one.
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.540]  They've already got licensing protocol in place.
[14:50.540 --> 14:52.980]  Other areas have decided to wait a year or two
[14:52.980 --> 14:55.420]  before they jump into the rollout.
[14:55.420 --> 14:57.820]  And all of those areas now are gonna be facing
[14:57.820 --> 15:01.340]  a very different investment market than they would otherwise.
[15:01.340 --> 15:02.480]  And that's sort of the point.
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.480]  The Antipod Group, Project Sam, their head Kevin Sebette,
[15:08.160 --> 15:10.440]  this is what he pushed for and why.
[15:10.440 --> 15:13.420]  He wanted to take some of the money support out.
[15:13.420 --> 15:17.000]  And it looks like that might have already started to happen.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.720]  Well, yeah, wouldn't you be scared if they're like,
[15:18.720 --> 15:20.480]  hey, you're not protected anymore?
[15:21.760 --> 15:22.920]  Yes and no.
[15:22.920 --> 15:24.360]  If you're playing with that type of money.
[15:24.360 --> 15:26.240]  We didn't have protection that,
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.360]  we didn't really have protection to begin with.
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.440]  We had a memo.
[15:32.100 --> 15:34.660]  And honestly, folks, you guys work
[15:34.660 --> 15:37.360]  in all sorts of different fields, I'm sure, listeners.
[15:38.320 --> 15:42.600]  Memo means memo across industries in the same way.
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.400]  Like when you get a memo, it's not like an update
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.400]  to the official company employee handbook even.
[15:51.400 --> 15:53.040]  It's just a memo saying like,
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.080]  hey, quit leaving your lunch in the fridge
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.520]  for two weeks until it rots.
[15:56.520 --> 15:58.240]  Quit playing nickel back in the trim room.
[15:58.240 --> 16:00.700]  Right, no more naps at lunch
[16:00.700 --> 16:02.520]  because nobody wakes up on time.
[16:02.520 --> 16:05.600]  That's memo worthy kind of guidance.
[16:05.600 --> 16:06.680]  And that's what this was.
[16:06.680 --> 16:07.520]  It was a memo.
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.960]  It was an official governmental memo
[16:09.960 --> 16:11.880]  from the Attorney General of the United States,
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.560]  but it was still just a memo.
[16:15.560 --> 16:18.960]  And so the amount of protection it gave us
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.300]  was really minimal.
[16:21.600 --> 16:23.520]  It was not at all permanent.
[16:23.520 --> 16:26.900]  And a lot of people like me have really continued
[16:26.900 --> 16:29.620]  to push the cannabis community to get involved
[16:29.620 --> 16:32.920]  and really push your local elected representatives
[16:32.920 --> 16:36.560]  to move our protections into something that is permanent.
[16:37.400 --> 16:38.240]  We need to change federal law.
[16:38.240 --> 16:39.800]  There's no reason cannabis should be listed
[16:39.800 --> 16:42.360]  as a Schedule I narcotic alongside heroin.
[16:43.480 --> 16:46.880]  There's no reason we should have federal prosecutors
[16:46.880 --> 16:48.860]  worried about marijuana, period.
[16:49.680 --> 16:51.560]  If this was legal, lots of things
[16:51.560 --> 16:53.080]  would be better and different.
[16:53.080 --> 16:56.020]  But to get that change made,
[16:56.020 --> 16:59.000]  we need mass support from the public.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.540]  And that's kind of the other thing
[17:02.540 --> 17:04.120]  that's happening right now.
[17:04.640 --> 17:09.640]  Monday morning, legal cannabis wasn't under attack.
[17:09.800 --> 17:11.320]  This memo was in place.
[17:11.320 --> 17:13.200]  No one was talking about it.
[17:13.200 --> 17:16.960]  Last week, Jeff Sessions rescinded a whole bunch of memos,
[17:18.880 --> 17:21.560]  rolling back Obama-era guidance policies
[17:21.560 --> 17:23.360]  on a bunch of different stuff.
[17:23.360 --> 17:25.840]  And this wasn't included,
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.840]  which kind of gave California a nice little shot in the arm.
[17:30.840 --> 17:33.880]  But it was never permanent.
[17:34.780 --> 17:38.220]  But neither was, like, there was no attack going on,
[17:38.220 --> 17:43.220]  and so there was no sense of urgency to rally support for.
[17:43.600 --> 17:47.300]  And in the couple of days since this announcement's come out
[17:47.300 --> 17:50.640]  and that the call memo was rescinded officially,
[17:50.640 --> 17:53.120]  we've seen a huge amount of galvanization
[17:53.120 --> 17:55.180]  across the industry from coast to coast.
[17:56.160 --> 17:57.760]  There's been a couple of really cool things
[17:57.760 --> 17:59.120]  that have happened locally.
[18:01.120 --> 18:03.640]  With legislatures from both sides of the aisle,
[18:03.640 --> 18:06.640]  Republican, Democrat, I mean, hardcore Trump voters,
[18:06.640 --> 18:09.000]  like, wait, you said states' rights.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.580]  They're jumping ship, and all of a sudden,
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.500]  they're willing to work with people across the aisle
[18:13.500 --> 18:16.120]  who they didn't want anything to do with on Monday morning,
[18:16.120 --> 18:18.840]  because this is an attack on something
[18:18.840 --> 18:21.760]  a whole lot of us have come to see as a great idea.
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.120]  And watching everybody sort of coalesce and come together
[18:26.120 --> 18:29.160]  has been really kind of encouraging this week.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.720]  It has been neat watching everybody post
[18:30.720 --> 18:32.360]  the fuck sessions videos,
[18:32.360 --> 18:34.680]  or a picture of themselves session for sessions.
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.280]  That has been fun to see that support.
[18:36.280 --> 18:38.440]  Already, there's a couple of,
[18:38.440 --> 18:41.400]  I'm sure there's a petition or three on change.org.
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.840]  Already, there are a couple of really easy things you can do.
[18:45.840 --> 18:50.320]  I noticed the r slash trees forum on Reddit.
[18:50.320 --> 18:55.320]  One of the top posts immediately was a super easy format page
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.240]  for figuring out who your local elected representatives are
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.320]  in the House or the Senate, how to contact them.
[19:04.320 --> 19:07.360]  And then they even gave you a couple of paragraphs.
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.280]  If you're not the type of person who wants to sit down
[19:10.280 --> 19:12.200]  and write a letter to your congressman,
[19:12.200 --> 19:14.360]  they gave you a real simple letter saying,
[19:14.360 --> 19:16.920]  hey, Jeff Sessions did this.
[19:16.920 --> 19:18.200]  This is unacceptable.
[19:18.200 --> 19:20.080]  I support legalization.
[19:20.080 --> 19:24.800]  Please do this and this to keep those protections in place.
[19:25.320 --> 19:27.200]  And then it's auto fills in your name.
[19:27.200 --> 19:28.560]  It's super easy to do.
[19:30.920 --> 19:34.800]  There's a couple of different groups that have formed
[19:34.800 --> 19:37.480]  to help bring out elected reps
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.960]  and different elected officials at all levels
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.280]  that are supporting legalization.
[19:42.280 --> 19:45.400]  And most of these people who were for five years ago,
[19:45.400 --> 19:46.440]  couldn't give a shit.
[19:47.400 --> 19:48.880]  It wasn't an issue on their radar.
[19:48.880 --> 19:51.360]  They weren't willing to talk about it in public.
[19:51.360 --> 19:54.000]  And now they're out front fighting for us.
[19:55.800 --> 19:57.480]  Locally in Colorado,
[19:59.160 --> 20:03.160]  this basically means nothing practically for the industry.
[20:03.160 --> 20:05.520]  Our industry is established.
[20:05.520 --> 20:08.000]  I'm sure there's plenty of companies looking for investors
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.160]  to expand and whatnot, but for the most part, we're here
[20:11.160 --> 20:13.280]  and we've been at work for a while now.
[20:13.280 --> 20:14.120]  So-
[20:14.120 --> 20:15.680]  I actually wrote down that I wouldn't be worried
[20:15.680 --> 20:18.800]  until that one rogue cop in California starts doing raids
[20:18.800 --> 20:21.560]  or the DEA starts making waves in California.
[20:21.560 --> 20:23.640]  I completely feel that California would be first
[20:23.680 --> 20:24.960]  because they're rolling out new laws.
[20:24.960 --> 20:27.600]  So the media coverage has them in the spotlight
[20:27.600 --> 20:29.160]  and they are not as well established
[20:29.160 --> 20:31.080]  and regulated as Colorado.
[20:31.080 --> 20:32.760]  That was something that I had actually written down
[20:32.760 --> 20:34.120]  as a note.
[20:34.120 --> 20:36.640]  Well, what, I mean, basically the process
[20:36.640 --> 20:40.440]  for in federal enforcement would be the attorney general
[20:40.440 --> 20:44.280]  tells like his assistant attorney generals to go do it.
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.760]  And then they contact local law enforcement
[20:46.760 --> 20:48.400]  and start doing it.
[20:48.400 --> 20:52.560]  So for Colorado, our US attorney's name is Bob Troyer.
[20:54.200 --> 20:56.880]  And he's covers the district of Colorado
[20:56.880 --> 20:58.680]  is what they call his district.
[20:58.680 --> 21:01.040]  And he came out like five minutes after the news
[21:01.040 --> 21:03.120]  that this was getting rescinded saying,
[21:03.120 --> 21:06.400]  this means zero change in policy for his office.
[21:06.400 --> 21:10.880]  So the day after this big announcement came out,
[21:10.880 --> 21:14.680]  he expects no change in what he does every day.
[21:14.680 --> 21:16.880]  And right now, one of the things he doesn't do
[21:16.880 --> 21:19.520]  is mess with legal cannabis businesses in any way.
[21:20.360 --> 21:24.200]  He's happy to prosecute if somebody says,
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.000]  hey, this legal marijuana business
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.080]  is not fully playing by the rules.
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.160]  They're breaking this rule or that rule.
[21:31.160 --> 21:33.080]  He might take interest then,
[21:33.080 --> 21:35.000]  but he's certainly not taking interest
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  in anybody following the rules.
[21:38.200 --> 21:41.400]  To top it off, our state elected attorney general,
[21:41.400 --> 21:43.800]  Cynthia Kaufman has come out saying,
[21:43.800 --> 21:46.440]  not only is her office not interested
[21:46.440 --> 21:49.400]  in prosecuting marijuana crimes in Colorado,
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.240]  when it's someone who's following the rules
[21:51.240 --> 21:53.280]  or a legal business following the rules,
[21:53.280 --> 21:55.200]  she said she's gonna fight the feds
[21:55.200 --> 21:56.800]  if they come in and try to toy with us.
[21:56.800 --> 21:57.640]  That's pretty awesome.
[21:57.640 --> 21:59.120]  Yep, and this is someone who,
[21:59.120 --> 22:01.040]  during the run up to legalization,
[22:01.040 --> 22:03.720]  was on board with Governor Hickenlooper saying,
[22:03.720 --> 22:05.360]  they're not comfortable with this decision
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.920]  by Colorado voters.
[22:06.920 --> 22:09.060]  They don't support legalization.
[22:10.840 --> 22:15.840]  They're worried about possible consequences of legalization.
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.920]  And now here we are five years later,
[22:18.920 --> 22:21.520]  having lived with legalization,
[22:21.520 --> 22:23.800]  and these people are out fighting for us.
[22:24.860 --> 22:26.540]  That's one of the things we didn't have
[22:26.540 --> 22:27.820]  before the Cole memo.
[22:29.040 --> 22:32.320]  This many Americans weren't living with dispensaries,
[22:32.320 --> 22:35.320]  weren't living with licensed grows,
[22:35.320 --> 22:37.480]  weren't living with, I mean, shit,
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.040]  there's 64,000 MED-badged people across Colorado.
[22:42.040 --> 22:43.600]  I'm not saying every single one of them's
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.360]  currently employed in the legal industry,
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.280]  but most of them are.
[22:46.280 --> 22:47.800]  Why else have a badge?
[22:47.840 --> 22:48.800]  They're not cheap.
[22:51.400 --> 22:54.480]  We didn't have all that, and now we do.
[22:55.440 --> 22:58.760]  Local elected officials who were really worried
[22:58.760 --> 23:01.240]  about legalization have now had five years
[23:01.240 --> 23:05.320]  to see that the marijuana was always there.
[23:05.320 --> 23:08.360]  All we've done is change where adults buy it,
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.200]  and that's been really good for places like Pueblo.
[23:12.200 --> 23:13.840]  I just teetered up that nail and it was ready to hit,
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.720]  but you just brought a good thought to my head.
[23:15.720 --> 23:18.400]  Do you think that now government,
[23:18.400 --> 23:19.880]  excuse me, government and law enforcement,
[23:19.880 --> 23:21.880]  now that they see how many people go to dispensaries,
[23:21.880 --> 23:24.200]  do you think they realize how much black market cannabis
[23:24.200 --> 23:25.880]  was being bought and sold?
[23:25.880 --> 23:27.440]  Does that give a glimpse?
[23:27.440 --> 23:29.560]  That's one of the things that cracks me up
[23:29.560 --> 23:32.400]  about the anti-pot community is they have no concept
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.000]  of what happened before legalization.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.920]  Out of sight was really out of mind for these people.
[23:37.920 --> 23:39.840]  It was happening, it just wasn't.
[23:39.840 --> 23:40.760]  All of it was there.
[23:40.800 --> 23:45.800]  The DEA puts the US buying like 40 to $60 billion
[23:46.520 --> 23:51.520]  worth of marijuana a year back in like 99, 2004, that area.
[23:52.960 --> 23:55.440]  And it's not like that market's gotten any smaller.
[23:55.440 --> 23:58.520]  So if you think of that nationally and you do the math,
[23:58.520 --> 24:01.640]  I was playing with these numbers at home earlier.
[24:01.640 --> 24:05.760]  If you take 60 billion in sales annually
[24:05.760 --> 24:07.320]  and you look at Colorado's market,
[24:07.320 --> 24:11.480]  we did 1.2 billion in one year.
[24:11.480 --> 24:15.320]  And it took about 64,000 of us to get that done.
[24:15.320 --> 24:17.240]  If you do the math, that works out to around
[24:17.240 --> 24:19.840]  4 million Americans coast to coast
[24:19.840 --> 24:22.280]  who were involved in some level
[24:22.280 --> 24:24.560]  with the illicit black market for marijuana.
[24:24.560 --> 24:26.040]  4 million people.
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.720]  I mean, it takes a lot of people
[24:27.720 --> 24:30.560]  to do $60 billion worth of business.
[24:30.560 --> 24:33.080]  But it was all just out of sight.
[24:33.080 --> 24:34.880]  It was just two guys meeting in the back
[24:34.880 --> 24:36.400]  of a parking lot real quick.
[24:36.400 --> 24:38.080]  They're probably old friends who saw each other
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.800]  on the highway and stopped to say hello.
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.640]  It doesn't look like a marijuana sale going down.
[24:44.640 --> 24:47.620]  When someone walks into a dispensary,
[24:47.620 --> 24:50.040]  it's pretty clear that they're there to buy marijuana
[24:50.040 --> 24:52.200]  or at least to check out what legal marijuana
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.300]  looks like at the weed store.
[24:54.300 --> 24:56.320]  Like, there's no question what it is.
[24:56.320 --> 24:57.520]  So it's more visible now.
[24:57.520 --> 25:00.200]  But there's certainly not more marijuana now.
[25:00.200 --> 25:01.560]  I'd ever go just to look.
[25:02.480 --> 25:04.920]  I know people that do though.
[25:04.920 --> 25:07.400]  I've got one foot in both worlds.
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.400]  And so I know a lot of people who are still nervous
[25:11.400 --> 25:13.680]  about going to visit a legal dispensary
[25:13.680 --> 25:16.480]  because their profession would frown on it
[25:16.480 --> 25:18.800]  or something similar.
[25:18.800 --> 25:22.960]  But a lot of people, people that are paying attention,
[25:22.960 --> 25:25.960]  they see that we have far less people
[25:25.960 --> 25:28.120]  trying to sell pot locally to their friends
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.680]  to make side income.
[25:29.680 --> 25:32.520]  We see the benefit of moving all of those sales
[25:32.520 --> 25:35.600]  into a legal market and no one wants to go back
[25:35.600 --> 25:37.120]  to what it was like before this.
[25:37.120 --> 25:38.680]  A lot of us growers that were growing
[25:38.680 --> 25:40.280]  before so much legalization,
[25:40.280 --> 25:43.400]  we joke about how it's pointless to grow weed at home now.
[25:43.400 --> 25:45.560]  It doesn't even, there's no reason to grow
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.880]  unless you're growing strictly for yourself
[25:47.880 --> 25:48.840]  for medical cannabis.
[25:48.840 --> 25:50.880]  If you used to be a black market grower,
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.200]  there's no point in that.
[25:52.200 --> 25:53.120]  It's gone.
[25:53.120 --> 25:55.280]  Cannabis is so cheap at the dispensary.
[25:55.280 --> 25:57.520]  There's so many different things at the dispensary.
[25:57.520 --> 25:59.440]  There are so many dispensaries
[25:59.440 --> 26:02.240]  that there's no need for a home black market grower anymore.
[26:03.200 --> 26:05.160]  You gotta wait for him to be there.
[26:05.160 --> 26:06.000]  No need for that.
[26:06.000 --> 26:06.840]  Just go to the dispensary.
[26:06.840 --> 26:07.840]  The door's open and there are pretty girls
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.360]  working there to go talk to.
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.880]  Like you don't have to go sit on some dude's couch
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.960]  while he plays video games and deal with this dirty dog.
[26:12.960 --> 26:14.120]  You don't have to sit in a parking lot
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.160]  and wait for anybody.
[26:15.160 --> 26:17.880]  You walk into the store, some pretty girl goes, hey,
[26:17.880 --> 26:19.200]  and then she shows you a bunch of great weed.
[26:19.200 --> 26:21.600]  You get to see all kinds of good jars of weed.
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.080]  Yeah, everybody's theory before we got to see it
[26:24.080 --> 26:26.760]  in practice was that the taxes
[26:26.760 --> 26:28.440]  that everyone was gonna impose
[26:28.440 --> 26:31.000]  were gonna jack the price up to the point
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.240]  where the black market could just easily
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.400]  undercut the legal market.
[26:35.400 --> 26:40.160]  And that worked for a minute as Colorado's market emerged.
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.240]  But at this point in time,
[26:43.240 --> 26:45.480]  no one wants to deal with the hassle.
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.680]  I mean, you might be able to save a few bucks
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.800]  on your ounce buying it from the black market,
[26:51.800 --> 26:54.120]  but I mean, your time's worth something.
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.160]  It takes time to call, set that up, go over, hang out.
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.360]  Dispensary weed comes with a couple of other things.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.200]  Basement weed-
[27:02.200 --> 27:03.440]  You get a lot for your buck.
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.880]  Basement weed is great.
[27:04.880 --> 27:05.720]  Nothing wrong with it.
[27:05.720 --> 27:07.800]  Dispensary weed comes with a lab test.
[27:07.800 --> 27:10.440]  That lab test includes a microbial and yeast
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.120]  and contaminant test that tells you
[27:12.120 --> 27:13.920]  there's nothing funky in that herb.
[27:13.920 --> 27:16.520]  It also comes with a THC potency test
[27:16.520 --> 27:18.600]  that tells you how strong that herb is.
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.640]  It also comes with a pesticide residual testing
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.160]  to tell you if there are any pesticides in it.
[27:24.160 --> 27:26.920]  If they find any problems in any of those tests,
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.560]  that batch of cannabis is pulled and re-examined
[27:29.560 --> 27:32.640]  and reassessed what can be done with that product.
[27:32.640 --> 27:35.560]  If it can be used for concentrates, maybe they'll do that.
[27:35.560 --> 27:38.400]  Sometimes product is destroyed
[27:38.400 --> 27:40.640]  because it does not pass these tests.
[27:40.640 --> 27:43.860]  For some people, if you have some sort of lung disease,
[27:43.860 --> 27:45.720]  I don't even know what a lung disease might be,
[27:45.720 --> 27:48.040]  a heart disease, a lung disease, a throat disease,
[27:48.040 --> 27:50.120]  a mouth disease, an autoimmune disease,
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.620]  if you're compromised in any way,
[27:51.620 --> 27:53.980]  that lab test means a fucking lot to you.
[27:54.940 --> 27:57.900]  That lab test is way worth the extra tax
[27:57.900 --> 27:59.900]  you might pay at the dispensary.
[27:59.900 --> 28:02.820]  You get lab testing, you get product consistency,
[28:02.820 --> 28:05.660]  you get a selection and a level of service
[28:05.660 --> 28:07.620]  that's just not possible with the black market.
[28:07.620 --> 28:10.060]  And the person inside the dispensary with the gun
[28:10.060 --> 28:11.260]  is a security guard.
[28:11.260 --> 28:13.340]  We've asked him to be there with a gun.
[28:13.340 --> 28:14.980]  Wherever else you're going to get your herb,
[28:14.980 --> 28:16.880]  I don't know who's got a gun there.
[28:17.740 --> 28:19.880]  I mean, it's substantially safer.
[28:23.980 --> 28:26.700]  I mean, the black market comes with
[28:26.700 --> 28:30.740]  a number of really nasty just necessities.
[28:31.820 --> 28:34.020]  Every decision made in the black market
[28:34.020 --> 28:35.820]  is based on economics, period.
[28:37.100 --> 28:40.060]  Where does the black market produce the product?
[28:40.060 --> 28:42.220]  Wherever it's economical to.
[28:42.220 --> 28:43.660]  Who handles the product?
[28:43.660 --> 28:45.580]  Whoever it's economical to.
[28:45.580 --> 28:47.100]  Who moves, who sells it?
[28:47.100 --> 28:48.780]  Whoever it's economical to.
[28:48.780 --> 28:50.100]  Who does the ID checks?
[28:50.100 --> 28:51.100]  Fucking no one.
[28:51.100 --> 28:52.180]  No one.
[28:52.180 --> 28:53.060]  Who pays taxes?
[28:53.060 --> 28:53.900]  No one.
[28:54.720 --> 28:55.820]  There's no lab testing.
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.260]  When product molds out or gets coated in PM,
[29:00.260 --> 29:02.700]  there's all sorts of stuff that's super commonplace
[29:02.700 --> 29:06.420]  in the black market to maintain the highest profit ratio
[29:06.420 --> 29:09.780]  possible on any product that's produced.
[29:09.780 --> 29:13.420]  In the legal market, marijuana's grown
[29:13.420 --> 29:16.820]  in appropriately zoned parcels of land
[29:16.820 --> 29:19.620]  by people who have passed background checks
[29:20.540 --> 29:22.300]  before they're even allowed to apply
[29:22.300 --> 29:23.860]  for the jobs in the industry.
[29:24.820 --> 29:27.100]  We had a Department of Agriculture inspection.
[29:27.100 --> 29:28.980]  And the lady was impressed with my knowledge
[29:28.980 --> 29:33.020]  in the Department of Agriculture rules
[29:33.020 --> 29:35.420]  in our medical marijuana facility.
[29:35.420 --> 29:37.620]  I taught the Department of Agriculture lady
[29:37.620 --> 29:39.820]  a few things and she was quite impressed.
[29:40.740 --> 29:42.780]  And it turns out my certification
[29:42.780 --> 29:44.580]  that I've got never expires.
[29:44.580 --> 29:46.460]  I've got like the highest thing you can get.
[29:46.460 --> 29:48.540]  Right, you basically took the class
[29:48.540 --> 29:50.940]  that the people that work at the Department of Agriculture
[29:50.940 --> 29:52.460]  take before they go to inspections.
[29:52.460 --> 29:54.500]  It was a really cool little discovery.
[29:54.500 --> 29:55.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:56.860 --> 29:59.540]  But there's a lot of things that come with legalization
[29:59.540 --> 30:02.860]  that one by one have slowly won over
[30:02.860 --> 30:04.900]  huge chunks of the public.
[30:04.900 --> 30:06.860]  Sorry folks, I thought I turned that ringer off.
[30:06.860 --> 30:07.820]  I think you turned it back on
[30:07.820 --> 30:09.460]  when he thought you turned it off.
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.700]  It's not just lab testing and like where the product's grown
[30:14.700 --> 30:16.380]  or who gets to sell it.
[30:16.380 --> 30:20.460]  But voters finally get a say in all of that.
[30:20.620 --> 30:23.620]  Colorado's as legal and pervasive a marijuana market
[30:23.620 --> 30:25.620]  as exists anywhere on the planet.
[30:25.620 --> 30:27.920]  And there's still a majority of the state
[30:27.920 --> 30:30.580]  who's banned our businesses.
[30:30.580 --> 30:31.460]  Yeah.
[30:31.460 --> 30:33.860]  A lot of them are starting to rethink that decision
[30:33.860 --> 30:35.780]  because they've seen Pueblo and Trinidad
[30:35.780 --> 30:38.300]  and a couple of other places that have been
[30:38.300 --> 30:42.180]  like economic punchlines around Colorado for decades
[30:43.140 --> 30:47.260]  really start to thrive again because we allow this industry.
[30:47.260 --> 30:49.820]  It brought a new wave of investment to Southern Colorado
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.540]  and really got us back on our feet.
[30:51.540 --> 30:53.940]  It's really changed around here in the past couple of years.
[30:53.940 --> 30:58.300]  Yep, there's one of the big anti-pop people
[30:58.300 --> 31:00.900]  put out a list of talking points
[31:00.900 --> 31:03.060]  to all of his little disciples.
[31:03.060 --> 31:04.620]  And one of them is in Colorado,
[31:04.620 --> 31:06.580]  they can't even find construction workers
[31:06.580 --> 31:08.340]  to pass a drug test.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.620]  And I always laugh when I see that
[31:09.620 --> 31:13.580]  because it's while slightly true,
[31:13.580 --> 31:15.360]  I happen to know a lot about the company
[31:15.360 --> 31:16.420]  they're talking about.
[31:16.420 --> 31:19.700]  And the reason that company has trouble finding employees
[31:20.540 --> 31:22.140]  is because they pay their people shit
[31:22.140 --> 31:24.940]  and have for decades and they've always had trouble
[31:24.940 --> 31:26.820]  maintaining an employment for us.
[31:26.820 --> 31:28.980]  But right now Colorado's workforce,
[31:28.980 --> 31:32.060]  we've got like 2%, 2.9% or 3% unemployment
[31:32.060 --> 31:33.260]  across the state.
[31:33.260 --> 31:35.180]  It's as low as it's been in forever.
[31:35.180 --> 31:37.540]  The only people still looking for a job,
[31:37.540 --> 31:39.340]  the biggest fuckups you ever met,
[31:39.340 --> 31:40.860]  or they just relocated
[31:40.860 --> 31:43.300]  or they just lost their job for some reason.
[31:43.300 --> 31:44.740]  Most of them weren't planning for it
[31:44.740 --> 31:47.260]  because right now most people
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.000]  are happily gainfully employed.
[31:50.180 --> 31:52.620]  Like these numbers are as low as they've been
[31:52.620 --> 31:54.140]  since I've lived here.
[31:54.140 --> 31:56.740]  Yeah, it's not like every business you go to around here,
[31:56.740 --> 31:58.420]  you could be high working at.
[31:58.420 --> 32:01.360]  Most of the business around here will require a drug test.
[32:01.360 --> 32:03.020]  Like if you drive that way and that way,
[32:03.020 --> 32:05.580]  it's car dealerships, all those mechanics and techs,
[32:05.580 --> 32:07.020]  I bet you they get a P-test.
[32:07.020 --> 32:07.860]  I don't know for sure,
[32:07.860 --> 32:09.500]  but you would assume like that's Ford.
[32:09.500 --> 32:12.180]  I bet you Ford piss tests their techs and stuff.
[32:12.180 --> 32:14.260]  Of the rule of thumb is the bigger the company,
[32:14.260 --> 32:15.740]  the more likely it is to do it
[32:15.740 --> 32:19.780]  because they get huge insurance discounts for doing so.
[32:19.780 --> 32:21.340]  We've got AT&T downtown.
[32:21.340 --> 32:23.180]  I know damn well they P-test you.
[32:23.180 --> 32:24.740]  And if they think you're doing something stupid,
[32:24.740 --> 32:25.620]  it's in your contract.
[32:25.620 --> 32:27.340]  They could P-test you whenever they want
[32:27.340 --> 32:28.660]  and they've done it.
[32:28.660 --> 32:30.740]  Several of the jobs I had before,
[32:30.740 --> 32:32.660]  what I do now, drug tested.
[32:32.660 --> 32:34.780]  Mike, this got super random.
[32:34.780 --> 32:36.500]  You've got a lot of talking points written down.
[32:36.500 --> 32:38.100]  I want to make sure that you get everything out.
[32:38.100 --> 32:41.380]  Do you have anything you need to loop around on that paper
[32:41.380 --> 32:42.220]  because I didn't see you-
[32:42.220 --> 32:43.980]  Okay, yes we do.
[32:43.980 --> 32:45.260]  We do.
[32:46.100 --> 32:48.180]  Let's put this back on the track.
[32:48.180 --> 32:50.260]  There are a couple of really cool things
[32:50.260 --> 32:53.740]  that have happened since AG Sessions
[32:54.980 --> 32:56.660]  rescinded the Cole memo.
[32:56.660 --> 32:59.220]  And one of those things was in Pueblo, Colorado,
[32:59.220 --> 33:01.940]  we've got a county commissioner named Sal Pace.
[33:01.940 --> 33:05.300]  And this guy, I remember Sal
[33:05.300 --> 33:09.860]  when he was very on the fence about legal marijuana.
[33:09.860 --> 33:11.620]  Medical marijuana rules
[33:11.620 --> 33:14.180]  were just starting to be thought about.
[33:14.220 --> 33:17.820]  This was in like 2007, eight, nine.
[33:17.820 --> 33:20.500]  He was not at all comfortable with legal marijuana,
[33:20.500 --> 33:22.460]  medical marijuana.
[33:22.460 --> 33:24.540]  Like a lot of elected officials at the time,
[33:24.540 --> 33:27.620]  he was raised on anti-marijuana propaganda
[33:27.620 --> 33:29.820]  and we've slowly seen him emerge
[33:30.900 --> 33:33.340]  and actually become the face of regulation
[33:33.340 --> 33:35.100]  for a lot of Colorado.
[33:35.100 --> 33:36.820]  When people think marijuana rules
[33:36.820 --> 33:39.700]  in Colorado government and politics,
[33:39.700 --> 33:41.700]  a lot of times Sal is who they think of.
[33:42.660 --> 33:44.180]  The Pueblo County commissioners
[33:44.180 --> 33:48.660]  were sort of the first set of small government people
[33:48.660 --> 33:50.260]  to really get into rulemaking.
[33:51.580 --> 33:54.700]  And I remember this guy when he was against us.
[33:54.700 --> 33:57.860]  So it's really fun to see how much he's evolved,
[33:57.860 --> 33:59.980]  mainly just having to see it all.
[34:01.740 --> 34:02.940]  Like I remember begging him
[34:02.940 --> 34:04.980]  to go check out a dispensary for the first time,
[34:04.980 --> 34:06.780]  along with his fellow commissioners
[34:06.780 --> 34:09.300]  and him just shaking his head at me.
[34:10.300 --> 34:13.660]  But Friday after this news broke,
[34:13.660 --> 34:16.020]  Sal arranged a conference call
[34:16.020 --> 34:19.420]  with 100 elected officials from all across the US
[34:19.420 --> 34:21.100]  and legal marijuana states,
[34:21.100 --> 34:22.740]  kind of getting everybody galvanized
[34:22.740 --> 34:24.620]  and on the same page to fight this.
[34:25.860 --> 34:28.100]  And that was really huge.
[34:28.100 --> 34:29.620]  I love seeing stuff like that.
[34:29.620 --> 34:32.460]  And there's been a couple of those incidents
[34:32.460 --> 34:35.140]  in the last two or three days where,
[34:35.140 --> 34:37.180]  honestly folks, if you follow the press on this,
[34:37.500 --> 34:39.660]  you're gonna have an awesome week this week.
[34:41.020 --> 34:43.020]  One of the other really cool things that happened
[34:43.020 --> 34:45.660]  is the very next day, Vermont,
[34:46.700 --> 34:49.940]  their state house is discussing legalization.
[34:49.940 --> 34:52.620]  It looks like Vermont might be, I think the first,
[34:52.620 --> 34:55.860]  if not the first, one of the first states
[34:55.860 --> 35:00.500]  to pass legal marijuana, recreational adult use,
[35:00.500 --> 35:03.300]  no medical card needed legalization
[35:03.340 --> 35:07.420]  by vote of elected representatives in state government
[35:07.420 --> 35:11.180]  rather than by a vote of the people, just average voters.
[35:11.180 --> 35:12.300]  The house voted it.
[35:12.300 --> 35:16.100]  Yep, so their house of representatives voted
[35:16.100 --> 35:19.380]  to approve home grow and legal possession limits.
[35:19.380 --> 35:21.660]  I think it's two plants and flower
[35:21.660 --> 35:24.220]  and an ounce possession limit, if I remember right.
[35:25.980 --> 35:26.820]  And they did that the day after.
[35:26.820 --> 35:28.780]  One ounce, two plants.
[35:28.780 --> 35:30.780]  Or the day of this announcement,
[35:30.780 --> 35:33.020]  they voted after this news came out
[35:33.740 --> 35:35.380]  and they voted in favor of legalization,
[35:35.380 --> 35:37.500]  which I thought was really cool.
[35:38.500 --> 35:40.140]  I love that that's still happening.
[35:40.140 --> 35:42.140]  It's not a done deal in Vermont.
[35:42.140 --> 35:44.940]  Their Senate still needs to vote in favor
[35:44.940 --> 35:48.100]  and then their governor would need to sign that into law.
[35:48.100 --> 35:53.100]  Both their Senate and the governor have mentioned
[35:53.100 --> 35:55.140]  or come out in favor of this law.
[35:56.740 --> 35:58.900]  It's a dialed back version of one that was debated
[35:58.900 --> 36:01.380]  and got very close to passage last year.
[36:01.380 --> 36:03.980]  And so it looks good for Vermont.
[36:03.980 --> 36:06.180]  My fingers are crossed for Vermont.
[36:07.140 --> 36:09.020]  We got an email from a listener in Vermont
[36:09.020 --> 36:11.780]  who made sure I was privy to this information.
[36:11.780 --> 36:13.620]  And he said, I'm pulling up his email.
[36:13.620 --> 36:16.340]  He said, white Mike may have hooked you up
[36:16.340 --> 36:18.820]  with this knowledge already, but just in case he hasn't.
[36:18.820 --> 36:20.780]  And then he sent me a good link to it.
[36:20.780 --> 36:22.060]  He sent me a good article.
[36:22.060 --> 36:23.580]  So thanks for that, my friend.
[36:23.580 --> 36:24.940]  I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned
[36:24.940 --> 36:27.540]  that one of our friends, we have listeners in Vermont, dude.
[36:27.540 --> 36:29.620]  Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island.
[36:29.620 --> 36:30.460]  We've gotten emails from our house folks up there.
[36:30.460 --> 36:32.940]  I have a question for our Vermont listeners.
[36:32.940 --> 36:36.260]  If you're in Vermont, okay, so here's my question.
[36:36.260 --> 36:39.300]  I think the publication is called like VT Diggler.
[36:41.100 --> 36:43.920]  It appears to be a newspaper.
[36:43.920 --> 36:46.780]  It might just be a website for people in recovery.
[36:46.780 --> 36:49.900]  I can't tell the difference from their online presence,
[36:49.900 --> 36:51.740]  but they've been doing a lot of op-eds
[36:51.740 --> 36:53.460]  for and against legal marijuana.
[36:53.460 --> 36:55.100]  Tweet me and tell me what the hell that is.
[36:55.100 --> 36:56.460]  Would you please?
[36:56.460 --> 36:58.660]  Like, is it a newspaper or is it just like
[36:58.820 --> 37:01.420]  an anti-pot group website or what is it?
[37:01.420 --> 37:02.300]  So what's it called?
[37:02.300 --> 37:04.820]  I think it's called VT Diggler.
[37:04.820 --> 37:07.500]  VT Diggler, that sounds like a troll page.
[37:07.500 --> 37:11.180]  Right, I might be, their logo's weird.
[37:11.180 --> 37:12.820]  It's like letters inside diamonds
[37:12.820 --> 37:14.660]  inside circles or some shit.
[37:14.660 --> 37:16.460]  And so it's kind of, yeah.
[37:16.460 --> 37:17.300]  And it's from Vermont.
[37:17.300 --> 37:19.380]  Well, it's VT Diggler, it's the Vermont Diggler.
[37:19.380 --> 37:22.380]  Yep, and I'd like to apologize to the people of Vermont.
[37:22.380 --> 37:24.180]  One of our local anti-pot kooks
[37:24.180 --> 37:26.380]  has started traveling to Vermont.
[37:26.380 --> 37:29.140]  Some anti-pot group out there is flying her out
[37:29.140 --> 37:31.500]  to spread her brand of dip shittery.
[37:31.500 --> 37:33.340]  And I apologize for that.
[37:33.340 --> 37:36.300]  That's something we let export from our area
[37:36.300 --> 37:38.580]  that, yeah, it's not pleasant.
[37:38.580 --> 37:39.540]  Sorry for that.
[37:40.820 --> 37:44.220]  This email also says that if all goes according to plan,
[37:44.220 --> 37:46.220]  this would mean all states touching New York
[37:46.220 --> 37:48.780]  would have some form of decriminalization,
[37:48.780 --> 37:50.380]  with PA being the exception.
[37:51.300 --> 37:52.460]  PA gonna take a while.
[37:52.460 --> 37:56.700]  One of the other things I wanted to roll back to
[37:56.700 --> 38:01.700]  is the Cone Memo only gave what little protection
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.540]  it provided to recreational marijuana.
[38:06.540 --> 38:09.300]  It did absolutely nothing for medical.
[38:09.300 --> 38:12.060]  And there's substantially more medical marijuana states
[38:12.060 --> 38:13.620]  than there are recreational.
[38:14.780 --> 38:16.580]  The piece of federal legislation
[38:16.580 --> 38:19.460]  that governs medical marijuana states,
[38:19.460 --> 38:20.780]  and this is important, guys,
[38:20.820 --> 38:22.860]  so grab a pen and a sticky pad.
[38:24.540 --> 38:25.380]  You gonna sneeze?
[38:25.380 --> 38:27.420]  Excuse me, I've got like half a sneeze cooking.
[38:27.420 --> 38:28.420]  All right, if you start sneezing,
[38:28.420 --> 38:29.660]  I'll start ranting about something.
[38:29.660 --> 38:31.020]  I don't have anything on deck, but I'll put something out.
[38:31.020 --> 38:33.780]  Okay, so everybody's got their pen.
[38:33.780 --> 38:37.380]  This is called the Rohrabacher-Blumeyer Amendment.
[38:38.460 --> 38:41.820]  And it's amendment to the Omnibus Spending Bill,
[38:41.820 --> 38:44.020]  basically the federal budget every year.
[38:45.260 --> 38:47.940]  That's the document that gives protection
[38:47.940 --> 38:50.420]  to medical marijuana businesses
[38:51.060 --> 38:53.140]  and saying that feds can't spend money
[38:53.140 --> 38:57.060]  to target medical marijuana businesses,
[38:57.060 --> 38:59.660]  employees, patients that are operating
[38:59.660 --> 39:01.740]  in accordance with state law.
[39:01.740 --> 39:03.860]  It's substantially more protection
[39:03.860 --> 39:05.900]  than we had with the Cone Memo,
[39:05.900 --> 39:08.940]  and it's in jeopardy right now also.
[39:08.940 --> 39:12.500]  Sessions can't do dick with this on his own.
[39:12.500 --> 39:16.460]  This is up to your elected House and Senate members.
[39:16.460 --> 39:19.020]  So please, please, please hop online
[39:19.060 --> 39:22.300]  and Google who is my elected representative.
[39:22.300 --> 39:23.620]  It will take you to a website
[39:23.620 --> 39:25.940]  where it asks you to punch in your area code.
[39:25.940 --> 39:27.140]  You punch in your area code
[39:27.140 --> 39:29.300]  and it kicks you right to their page.
[39:29.300 --> 39:31.620]  Your representative is blah, blah, blah.
[39:31.620 --> 39:33.540]  Here's how you contact them.
[39:33.540 --> 39:35.460]  Click on those links, follow those links.
[39:35.460 --> 39:38.220]  Please contact your elected representatives
[39:38.220 --> 39:40.220]  and urge them to support
[39:40.220 --> 39:45.100]  the Rohrabacher-Blumeyer Amendment to the Spending Bill,
[39:45.100 --> 39:48.100]  the protections for medical marijuana businesses.
[39:48.140 --> 39:51.700]  These were just extended for a couple of weeks
[39:51.700 --> 39:56.060]  or two months, I think, and that window's about up.
[39:56.060 --> 39:58.580]  When the federal budget extension was just passed,
[39:58.580 --> 40:01.540]  if you follow federal news, you know what I just said.
[40:01.540 --> 40:04.900]  If you don't, basically the federal budget
[40:04.900 --> 40:05.980]  was set to expire.
[40:05.980 --> 40:07.900]  They haven't passed the new budget,
[40:07.900 --> 40:10.940]  and so they had to vote to extend the old budget,
[40:10.940 --> 40:12.660]  and that extended these protections
[40:12.660 --> 40:14.820]  which were included in the old budget,
[40:14.820 --> 40:17.660]  but until they are officially included in the new budget
[40:17.700 --> 40:20.660]  and that new budget is passed by a vote
[40:20.660 --> 40:25.060]  of the House and the Senate, it's not official yet.
[40:25.900 --> 40:28.820]  So we need to urge support for both of these
[40:28.820 --> 40:30.900]  from both sides of the aisle.
[40:30.900 --> 40:34.140]  Call your elected officials, email them, tweet them.
[40:34.140 --> 40:37.140]  They know what the Rohrabacher-Blumeyer Amendment is.
[40:37.140 --> 40:38.860]  Urge support, please.
[40:38.860 --> 40:40.260]  We need these protections.
[40:40.260 --> 40:42.020]  I know you're not the guy to ask this question,
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.540]  but can you spell that for people
[40:43.540 --> 40:44.660]  so that they can get a good,
[40:44.660 --> 40:46.660]  just enough to get Google started?
[40:46.660 --> 40:48.380]  Okay, so Rohrabacher and Blumeyer
[40:48.380 --> 40:50.300]  are named for the two people who wrote it.
[40:50.300 --> 40:53.500]  It used to be the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment.
[40:53.500 --> 40:58.500]  It's Rohrabacher, R-O-H-R-A-B-A-C-H-E-R,
[41:00.020 --> 41:05.020]  and then Blumeyer is B-L-U-M-E-N-A-U-E-R, I think.
[41:07.060 --> 41:09.020]  I jotted their names down real quick from the press
[41:09.020 --> 41:10.820]  while I was furiously taking notes before this.
[41:10.820 --> 41:12.940]  That should get you close enough in Google.
[41:13.940 --> 41:17.620]  If you Google Federal Medical Marijuana Protection Amendment,
[41:17.620 --> 41:20.300]  it should come up to, and all of those words
[41:20.300 --> 41:22.660]  are a lot easier to spell than Rohrabacher or Blumeyer.
[41:22.660 --> 41:25.020]  A lot of these folks are probably in a cubicle
[41:25.020 --> 41:28.420]  or cutting concrete or in a garden.
[41:28.420 --> 41:29.700]  So getting them to do that right now,
[41:29.700 --> 41:32.900]  we're gonna have to kinda just hand it right to them
[41:32.900 --> 41:33.740]  or it might not happen.
[41:33.740 --> 41:34.940]  So we gotta walk them right to the drink.
[41:34.940 --> 41:36.780]  What's the time post?
[41:36.780 --> 41:38.900]  41.52, but there will be editing.
[41:38.900 --> 41:42.100]  All right, go to about 35, 40 minutes and hit play,
[41:42.180 --> 41:43.700]  and hopefully you can get that piece
[41:43.700 --> 41:46.500]  that you need to Google to find your local rep
[41:46.500 --> 41:47.340]  and get ahold of them.
[41:47.340 --> 41:49.860]  Play that into Siri or Alexa.
[41:50.980 --> 41:52.500]  All right, Mike, it looks like you got more bullet points.
[41:52.500 --> 41:54.080]  I'm just double checking my notes
[41:54.080 --> 41:54.920]  to make sure that we hit everything we wanna hit.
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.380]  I wanna make sure you get everything out
[41:56.380 --> 41:57.940]  because you did a lot of homework over there for me
[41:57.940 --> 42:00.140]  and I wanna make sure we get it all put into the show for you
[42:00.140 --> 42:01.940]  I don't wanna waste your material.
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.460]  I appreciate you putting all that stuff together,
[42:03.460 --> 42:04.300]  by the way.
[42:04.300 --> 42:05.300]  Thanks, man.
[42:05.300 --> 42:07.740]  I've been following this story really closely.
[42:07.740 --> 42:09.540]  When this announcement came out, I was like,
[42:09.540 --> 42:12.900]  honestly, people were telling me on Instagram
[42:12.900 --> 42:14.660]  and on Facebook, when's Mike coming over?
[42:14.660 --> 42:16.260]  You gotta get Mike over for this episode.
[42:16.260 --> 42:17.220]  It's time to have Mike on.
[42:17.220 --> 42:18.060]  What are you guys doing?
[42:18.060 --> 42:19.060]  What's the talk with Mike?
[42:19.060 --> 42:20.820]  And I feel bad because I had to kick this back.
[42:20.820 --> 42:22.700]  We were gonna do it Friday, I had to push it back.
[42:22.700 --> 42:23.540]  Don't feel bad, dude.
[42:23.540 --> 42:24.860]  We were gonna do it Saturday, I had to push it back.
[42:24.860 --> 42:25.700]  I know exactly why.
[42:25.700 --> 42:26.540]  So glad I got here on Sunday.
[42:26.540 --> 42:28.660]  And it involves children and children first, bro,
[42:28.660 --> 42:29.500]  and the kids first.
[42:29.500 --> 42:30.620]  Family first always.
[42:30.620 --> 42:32.900]  Yeah, yeah, especially when it's little ones.
[42:34.340 --> 42:36.180]  This is a really important topic,
[42:36.220 --> 42:37.740]  and honestly, this is a really
[42:38.700 --> 42:40.980]  kind of pivotal moment in history.
[42:40.980 --> 42:43.580]  Like politics exists on a pendulum.
[42:45.300 --> 42:49.500]  The longer look you take down the historical timeline,
[42:49.500 --> 42:50.820]  the clearer this gets.
[42:51.660 --> 42:54.100]  Things go liberal, then things go conservative.
[42:55.100 --> 42:57.420]  The roaring 20s and all the liberalism
[42:57.420 --> 42:58.780]  and drinking and dancing,
[42:58.780 --> 43:03.060]  and the sexual revolution that took place in the 20s
[43:03.060 --> 43:05.500]  was completely crushed by the crash markets,
[43:05.540 --> 43:09.300]  or the stock market crash in the 1930s and 40s.
[43:09.300 --> 43:11.780]  Everything reversed hard.
[43:11.780 --> 43:13.420]  And we've seen that a couple of times.
[43:13.420 --> 43:17.020]  Historically, the 60s gave us the fucking 80s.
[43:19.580 --> 43:21.780]  Like disco was responsible for shoulder pads
[43:21.780 --> 43:24.620]  and suits for women all through the 80s, I think.
[43:24.620 --> 43:27.740]  Marijuana's been moving forward as a social policy
[43:27.740 --> 43:31.100]  in a major way since 1999.
[43:31.100 --> 43:34.140]  All movements bend towards legalization.
[43:34.140 --> 43:38.660]  There's bound to be at least an effort at a backswing.
[43:38.660 --> 43:43.660]  And that's needed before the galvanization of the country,
[43:44.340 --> 43:46.220]  and we decide that no, as a group,
[43:46.220 --> 43:48.260]  we're not gonna go back to that.
[43:48.260 --> 43:51.100]  And we actually take the next big step forward
[43:51.100 --> 43:53.420]  and start changing federal law.
[43:53.420 --> 43:57.260]  And it looks like this idiotic move by Sessions
[43:57.260 --> 43:59.740]  might have actually triggered that avalanche.
[44:00.620 --> 44:02.980]  There's a couple of different people talking about this
[44:02.980 --> 44:05.380]  that, I mean, man, on Monday,
[44:05.380 --> 44:07.580]  this wasn't a major talking point.
[44:07.580 --> 44:09.660]  Already the people who were mumbling
[44:09.660 --> 44:11.900]  about maybe running against Trump in 2020
[44:11.900 --> 44:14.340]  are talking about legal marijuana protections.
[44:17.460 --> 44:22.460]  Republicans that were in hotly contested races right now,
[44:23.100 --> 44:25.060]  going into the next election cycle
[44:25.980 --> 44:28.700]  for statewide elections are pissed
[44:28.700 --> 44:32.220]  because now their option is come out
[44:32.220 --> 44:35.420]  against something the Trump administration's doing,
[44:35.420 --> 44:37.780]  i.e. their own party's doing,
[44:37.780 --> 44:40.580]  and maybe piss off their base,
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.300]  or come out for marijuana and seem like a liberal druggie.
[44:45.540 --> 44:48.260]  And that's not a conversation they wanted to have
[44:48.260 --> 44:50.620]  going into the next round of elections.
[44:50.620 --> 44:53.300]  And now that's the conversation they're all having.
[44:53.300 --> 44:55.380]  Good, stir that shit up.
[44:55.380 --> 44:56.220]  Yep.
[44:57.540 --> 45:01.580]  If you're the donating type, hop online,
[45:01.580 --> 45:05.940]  find your representatives that are really supporting of this
[45:05.940 --> 45:08.460]  and send them one of those $4.20 donations.
[45:08.460 --> 45:09.740]  Let them know exactly why
[45:09.740 --> 45:10.940]  they're getting a few bucks from you.
[45:10.940 --> 45:12.140]  Hey, who said that?
[45:12.140 --> 45:14.740]  Who set that $4.20 donation thing up?
[45:14.740 --> 45:16.140]  Do you remember? Honestly, I can't remember
[45:16.140 --> 45:18.700]  if it was like Russ Belville or Tom Angle
[45:18.700 --> 45:21.500]  or just some putts at high times.
[45:21.500 --> 45:22.820]  It could have been anybody.
[45:22.820 --> 45:23.660]  But shout out to whoever did it.
[45:23.660 --> 45:24.900]  But that's been going for a few months,
[45:24.900 --> 45:27.140]  and it's not just you that have started
[45:27.140 --> 45:28.580]  to get a handful of those.
[45:29.580 --> 45:31.620]  Elected representatives for months
[45:31.620 --> 45:33.940]  have been getting donations like that.
[45:33.940 --> 45:35.660]  NORML, the National Organization
[45:35.660 --> 45:37.980]  for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,
[45:37.980 --> 45:39.820]  the Marijuana Policy Project,
[45:40.900 --> 45:43.220]  Students for a Sensible Drug Policy,
[45:43.220 --> 45:45.180]  all of those groups have been getting
[45:45.180 --> 45:48.060]  a lot of $4.20 donations since this came up.
[45:48.980 --> 45:50.460]  Of course, there's our Patreon account,
[45:50.460 --> 45:52.420]  my Patreon account for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[45:52.420 --> 45:54.340]  But I want to spread some love also.
[45:54.340 --> 45:58.380]  If you had to recommend one cannabis support group
[45:59.180 --> 46:00.980]  for somebody that needed some funding,
[46:00.980 --> 46:03.580]  where would you send $4.20 to right now
[46:03.580 --> 46:04.980]  if you could pick one group?
[46:06.540 --> 46:08.380]  He went silent and started staring at the sky.
[46:08.380 --> 46:10.540]  That's not an easy question,
[46:10.540 --> 46:12.300]  because there's a lot of groups doing
[46:12.300 --> 46:14.540]  a lot of good work on different fronts.
[46:14.540 --> 46:15.380]  Okay.
[46:18.380 --> 46:19.540]  Like if I was only going to make
[46:19.540 --> 46:21.500]  one political donation period,
[46:21.500 --> 46:23.260]  it wouldn't be for pot,
[46:23.260 --> 46:25.740]  which is kind of fucked up to say on this show.
[46:25.740 --> 46:27.580]  But it would go towards something else.
[46:27.620 --> 46:28.460]  Pot's not everything.
[46:28.460 --> 46:30.340]  Pot's not everything, that's all right.
[46:30.340 --> 46:33.340]  If I was going to make one marijuana-focused
[46:33.340 --> 46:34.660]  contribution right now,
[46:34.660 --> 46:37.380]  it would be one of two places, I think.
[46:37.380 --> 46:38.820]  I would either go for Normal.
[46:39.980 --> 46:41.300]  They're the oldest, they're the longest,
[46:41.300 --> 46:43.180]  they're the strongest, they're the most organized,
[46:43.180 --> 46:45.020]  and the best represented.
[46:45.020 --> 46:47.100]  It's hard to go wrong with Normal.
[46:47.100 --> 46:49.860]  And I would go for Gavin Newsom.
[46:50.900 --> 46:52.340]  If you're from the California area,
[46:52.340 --> 46:55.220]  or you follow politics, you know who that man is.
[46:55.220 --> 46:58.620]  And his next couple of years look really interesting.
[46:58.620 --> 47:01.900]  And we don't have a stronger ally in politics
[47:01.900 --> 47:03.020]  at his level right now.
[47:03.020 --> 47:05.300]  Well, then I'm going to choose Normal.
[47:05.300 --> 47:07.500]  If you guys are going to throw down a contribution,
[47:07.500 --> 47:08.540]  and it's not going to be
[47:08.540 --> 47:10.460]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast Patreon,
[47:10.460 --> 47:12.580]  go support Normal, the national organization
[47:12.580 --> 47:14.620]  for the reform of marijuana laws.
[47:14.620 --> 47:16.020]  N-O-R-M-L.
[47:16.020 --> 47:18.580]  Right, they're so old that you see Normal on,
[47:18.580 --> 47:22.620]  is it Cheech's shirt in the Nice Dreams show?
[47:22.620 --> 47:24.260]  Is it Nice Dreams with Cheech and Chong?
[47:24.260 --> 47:26.140]  One of the old Cheech and Chong movies,
[47:26.140 --> 47:26.980]  Cheech is full on-
[47:26.980 --> 47:28.780]  Normal's been around fighting since the 70s.
[47:28.780 --> 47:31.460]  Yeah, and Cheech is wearing the shirt proudly.
[47:31.460 --> 47:32.660]  They go to the dude's greenhouse
[47:32.660 --> 47:34.500]  where the lizard guy is growing the weed.
[47:34.500 --> 47:36.420]  He's wearing the fucking Normal shirt there, bro.
[47:36.420 --> 47:38.540]  So that's how long Normal's been around.
[47:38.540 --> 47:39.380]  So if you're going to support one-
[47:39.380 --> 47:41.180]  Normal's been around a very long time.
[47:41.180 --> 47:43.780]  And no Normal, no this show,
[47:43.780 --> 47:45.620]  no conversations like this happening.
[47:45.620 --> 47:46.460]  That's right.
[47:46.460 --> 47:47.580]  I remember a long time ago,
[47:47.580 --> 47:49.340]  when I was reading High Times and all that stuff,
[47:49.340 --> 47:50.460]  just being a young weed head,
[47:50.460 --> 47:53.380]  not knowing what I was even starting to get into.
[47:53.500 --> 47:55.060]  I knew that Normal was the way to go.
[47:55.060 --> 47:56.500]  So I'm glad that you said Normal.
[47:56.500 --> 47:57.940]  If you're going to send a contribution somewhere,
[47:57.940 --> 47:59.180]  you've already contributed to my show,
[47:59.180 --> 48:01.660]  or you want to spread some love in another direction,
[48:01.660 --> 48:04.420]  go support your local Normal, may be the way to go.
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.220]  If you've got a local Normal chapter, go check them out.
[48:07.220 --> 48:10.660]  And if this is a story you want a lot more information on,
[48:10.660 --> 48:13.520]  A, I'm sure we'll do news updates as this develops.
[48:14.420 --> 48:16.980]  Because this is definitely,
[48:16.980 --> 48:18.700]  it's not the first move in a dance,
[48:18.700 --> 48:22.620]  it's a move in a dance that's been going on for decades.
[48:22.660 --> 48:24.860]  So there will definitely be updates on this show,
[48:24.860 --> 48:27.500]  and updates on Pueblo for Sensible Candidates laws.
[48:28.920 --> 48:30.060]  Yeah, this is going to be ongoing
[48:30.060 --> 48:31.420]  until all 50 states are legal,
[48:31.420 --> 48:33.540]  and it's federally legal.
[48:33.540 --> 48:35.180]  Sorry, I just took a dab while Mike was ranting.
[48:35.180 --> 48:36.820]  I took a dab of the sour joker.
[48:36.820 --> 48:39.460]  I went in a little deeper than I wanted to.
[48:39.460 --> 48:40.900]  Someone throw me a life raft.
[48:42.660 --> 48:45.040]  Yeah, I hope we covered all the bases.
[48:46.140 --> 48:47.780]  This apothecary is pretty wonderful.
[48:47.780 --> 48:49.960]  If we skipped a piece, feel free to tweet me.
[48:49.960 --> 48:53.760]  It's at NemoPunk15, or at GrowFromYourHeartPodcast.
[48:53.760 --> 48:55.240]  Yeah, if you've got any input
[48:55.240 --> 48:57.080]  that you would like us to mention on the show,
[48:57.080 --> 48:57.920]  send me an email.
[48:57.920 --> 48:59.520]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[48:59.520 --> 49:01.040]  We'd like your input on this podcast.
[49:01.040 --> 49:02.340]  It's a little bonus episode for you.
[49:02.340 --> 49:04.080]  So you're welcome.
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.060]  I hope you enjoy it.
[49:05.060 --> 49:08.520]  Also folks, it's so cold lately
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.640]  that it's hard to think like this,
[49:10.640 --> 49:12.920]  even for us future-minded folks.
[49:12.920 --> 49:14.500]  But spring be a coming.
[49:15.340 --> 49:19.920]  It's time to start planning those projects for next year.
[49:21.460 --> 49:23.420]  Start looking ahead to what you wanna do
[49:23.420 --> 49:24.820]  if you're gonna do a garden.
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.940]  And if you've got questions on that path,
[49:27.940 --> 49:29.060]  hit us at emails.
[49:29.060 --> 49:31.020]  We've got time to get you your show
[49:31.020 --> 49:33.180]  before it's past time to get that done.
[49:34.020 --> 49:34.940]  That's right.
[49:34.940 --> 49:36.100]  And this was not a plan,
[49:36.100 --> 49:38.020]  but Mike, since you're pitching spring
[49:38.020 --> 49:39.860]  and the outdoor season coming up,
[49:39.860 --> 49:41.220]  make sure you visit my friends
[49:41.220 --> 49:44.220]  at the Hella Dank Seed Bank at dankseed.store.
[49:44.980 --> 49:46.780]  You gotta have seeds if you're gonna do a grow this spring.
[49:46.780 --> 49:49.260]  You know, one thing that was pointed out to me,
[49:49.260 --> 49:50.980]  I didn't go Google this, I didn't search this,
[49:50.980 --> 49:52.820]  somebody on a live feed pointed out to me
[49:52.820 --> 49:54.380]  that at the Hella Dank Seed Bank,
[49:54.380 --> 49:56.180]  they have a top 10 strains.
[49:56.180 --> 49:59.340]  Seven of the top 10 are iRate Genetics.
[49:59.340 --> 50:00.180]  Booyakasha.
[50:01.460 --> 50:02.300]  I'm proud.
[50:02.300 --> 50:03.120]  Did you do a couple of things,
[50:03.120 --> 50:03.960]  I don't wanna get into it now,
[50:03.960 --> 50:05.900]  that kinda step your shit up?
[50:06.900 --> 50:08.180]  I take pride in my things.
[50:08.180 --> 50:09.620]  I put my face on everything.
[50:09.620 --> 50:10.540]  It's me.
[50:10.540 --> 50:11.380]  There's not.
[50:11.380 --> 50:12.500]  It's a little more stable
[50:12.540 --> 50:14.660]  than a lot of people are throwing out, too.
[50:14.660 --> 50:15.940]  Well, let's not.
[50:17.180 --> 50:19.100]  I was gonna leave it at my first statement,
[50:19.100 --> 50:20.180]  and you started to elaborate
[50:20.180 --> 50:21.540]  in a different direction than I meant.
[50:21.540 --> 50:22.780]  Hey, Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out
[50:22.780 --> 50:24.260]  and doing a great podcast.
[50:24.260 --> 50:27.140]  Somebody today asked for longer episodes.
[50:27.140 --> 50:29.300]  You got a bonus episode that's 50 minutes long,
[50:29.300 --> 50:32.020]  so we love you, thank you for the support.
[50:32.020 --> 50:32.980]  Man, you got anything else to say?
[50:32.980 --> 50:35.020]  I'm gonna start doing that closing stuff.
[50:35.920 --> 50:38.180]  Mike just rolled his eyes and looked at the sky again.
[50:38.180 --> 50:40.020]  Is there a dry erase board hanging from the ceiling?
[50:40.020 --> 50:40.860]  I can't see.
[50:40.860 --> 50:42.780]  I'm just scratching through the one in my head.
[50:42.780 --> 50:45.900]  This is a big story with a lot of implications.
[50:45.900 --> 50:47.860]  I wanna make sure we hit all the bases.
[50:48.860 --> 50:50.420]  A lot of people are freaking out.
[50:50.420 --> 50:51.940]  Like some marijuana to stocks,
[50:51.940 --> 50:53.980]  which were a shit investment anyway,
[50:53.980 --> 50:55.940]  took a big crash after this announcement,
[50:55.940 --> 50:57.580]  but have already fully rebounded.
[50:59.300 --> 51:01.580]  Because it took a minute for everybody to remember,
[51:01.580 --> 51:03.600]  like, oh yeah, they call it the cone memo
[51:03.600 --> 51:05.880]  because it was just a memo.
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.440]  And that in reality, nothing has changed since.
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.000]  Nothing, I go to work every day, it's all the same.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[51:15.400 --> 51:17.400]  thank you for listening to our long, rambly podcast,

[51:46.200 --> 51:48.680]  About 140 episodes are up there now.
[51:48.680 --> 51:50.360]  I'm posting more over time.
[51:50.360 --> 51:51.480]  Just takes a little bit.
[51:51.480 --> 51:52.560]  If you'd like to interact with me
[51:52.560 --> 51:54.720]  and you're not into all the social media stuff,
[51:54.720 --> 51:55.560]  send me an email.
[51:55.560 --> 51:57.560]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[51:57.560 --> 51:59.560]  You know I love listener emails.
[51:59.560 --> 52:00.600]  I spoke about it earlier.
[52:00.600 --> 52:01.480]  I'll remind you once again,
[52:01.480 --> 52:02.760]  don't forget about Patreon.
[52:02.760 --> 52:04.400]  If you like this podcast,
[52:04.400 --> 52:06.520]  it was worth a couple bucks and you'd like to contribute,
[52:06.520 --> 52:10.000]  you can go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.680]  If you'd like to sign up and contribute as little as $1,
[52:12.680 --> 52:13.760]  I would appreciate it.
[52:13.760 --> 52:15.360]  If you want to contribute as much as,
[52:15.360 --> 52:17.920]  I don't think there's a limit on how many nines or zeros
[52:17.920 --> 52:20.040]  you press in there, so just keep typing.
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.000]  We'll see what the limit is.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.880]  We'll see if we can blow that Patreon up.
[52:22.880 --> 52:25.040]  But I would appreciate it if you support me on Patreon.
[52:25.040 --> 52:27.000]  What that does is help me cover the cost of my website.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.560]  It helps me buy these little, hey Mike.
[52:28.560 --> 52:29.520]  You know I try not to,
[52:29.520 --> 52:31.400]  but sometimes I spit into the microphone cover.
[52:31.400 --> 52:32.240]  But I'm sorry.
[52:32.240 --> 52:33.080]  You notice how it doesn't stink?
[52:33.080 --> 52:34.440]  It doesn't smell like whatever you ate last time?
[52:34.440 --> 52:35.880]  Do you remember the orange one that was here
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.800]  for like the first four months you did podcasts?
[52:37.800 --> 52:39.640]  That was another guy, the creepy mustache guy.
[52:39.640 --> 52:40.600]  It haunts me.
[52:40.600 --> 52:41.960]  He used to spit into it a lot.
[52:41.960 --> 52:44.520]  It's, yeah, whenever we break the microphones out,
[52:44.520 --> 52:46.600]  I do a tentative kind of sniff test.
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.440]  Yeah, yeah, well that's fairly new.
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.040]  Before I get right up on it.
[52:49.040 --> 52:50.040]  There's a little bag of them
[52:50.040 --> 52:51.560]  on the other side of the recording equipment.
[52:51.560 --> 52:52.940]  I keep them over there and when people leave,
[52:52.940 --> 52:53.920]  I just pop them out.
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.640]  And there's a reason this show sounds as good
[52:56.640 --> 52:57.480]  as it does, folks,
[52:57.480 --> 52:59.960]  and it's because Jeff's got some nice equipment
[52:59.960 --> 53:03.200]  and sometimes pieces of that equipment eat themselves.
[53:03.200 --> 53:05.000]  We had that fucking headphone amplifier.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.440]  We ate through like five of them.
[53:06.440 --> 53:08.880]  Yeah, we went through a good half dozen of those
[53:08.880 --> 53:09.720]  in a year. I had to go to Guitar Center
[53:09.720 --> 53:11.240]  and get an upgrade.
[53:11.240 --> 53:12.240]  Eventually they looked at me like,
[53:12.240 --> 53:13.240]  what are you doing to them?
[53:13.240 --> 53:15.440]  They'd see your van pulling and just get one.
[53:15.440 --> 53:19.120]  Here's two, just take two this time
[53:19.120 --> 53:20.660]  and when they break, bring them back.
[53:20.660 --> 53:22.200]  So that way you've got a backup already.
[53:22.200 --> 53:24.080]  But I just upgraded pieces, that's all.
[53:24.080 --> 53:25.460]  But yeah, sometimes shit does go wrong.
[53:25.460 --> 53:26.680]  Sometimes things break.
[53:26.720 --> 53:27.920]  I pay for high speed internet
[53:27.920 --> 53:29.360]  because uploading these large shows
[53:29.360 --> 53:30.200]  and YouTube channels takes a lot.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.360]  My devices don't like hash.
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.720]  I don't know why they fight so much.
[53:33.720 --> 53:35.720]  Don't talk about how sticky my iPad,
[53:35.720 --> 53:37.000]  my iPhone, and my computer are.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.400]  You could stick them all to the wall
[53:38.400 --> 53:39.400]  and use it as a desk.
[53:39.400 --> 53:41.600]  But yeah, the Patreon campaign, you guys,
[53:41.600 --> 53:42.760]  I use it to pay for the website.
[53:42.760 --> 53:44.360]  The website does cost quite a bit of money
[53:44.360 --> 53:45.400]  every year to cover.
[53:45.400 --> 53:47.240]  So your Patreon contributions will cover
[53:47.240 --> 53:48.160]  the cost of my website.
[53:48.160 --> 53:50.800]  You guys were kind enough to cover the website
[53:50.800 --> 53:53.240]  for me in 2017, so I appreciate that.
[53:53.240 --> 53:54.600]  That's huge, thank you listeners.
[53:54.600 --> 53:56.120]  Yeah, it does cost a little chunk of money
[53:56.560 --> 53:57.400]  to pay for the domain name
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.480]  and pay for all the hosting.
[53:58.480 --> 53:59.920]  I pay for a lot of bandwidth
[53:59.920 --> 54:01.440]  because I use a lot of bandwidth
[54:01.440 --> 54:03.240]  on that fucking website.
[54:03.240 --> 54:04.400]  Every episode is available,
[54:04.400 --> 54:06.200]  like the last hundred episodes I think
[54:06.200 --> 54:09.360]  is available that cost a little bit to host.
[54:09.360 --> 54:10.320]  But thank you, you guys covered it.
[54:10.320 --> 54:11.160]  I appreciate it.
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.640]  So that's what I do with the Patreon funds.
[54:12.640 --> 54:14.360]  Sorry, I'm trying to clear my throat while I talk.
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.200]  Took a big old dab.
[54:15.200 --> 54:16.240]  It's catching up with me.
[54:16.240 --> 54:18.100]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[54:18.100 --> 54:20.640]  See how many nines you can put
[54:20.640 --> 54:22.680]  in the contribution box.
[54:22.680 --> 54:24.560]  The challenge is on.
[54:24.560 --> 54:25.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:25.720 --> 54:26.640]  I don't want to get rich from podcasting.
[54:26.640 --> 54:27.640]  I love doing the pod.
[54:27.640 --> 54:29.560]  If I do get rich from podcasting, fuck yeah.
[54:29.560 --> 54:31.040]  But that was never my goal.
[54:31.040 --> 54:33.060]  I, honestly how it started,
[54:33.060 --> 54:34.000]  I was sitting, not how,
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.200]  but part of how it started was
[54:35.200 --> 54:36.440]  I used to hang out with Maddie and Spence
[54:36.440 --> 54:37.340]  at their house.
[54:37.340 --> 54:38.800]  And people would come through all the time
[54:38.800 --> 54:40.320]  and we'd smoke and hang out and dab.
[54:40.320 --> 54:41.160]  And then people would be like,
[54:41.160 --> 54:42.480]  Ross DeJeff, tell me this about plants.
[54:42.480 --> 54:43.560]  Help me grow.
[54:43.560 --> 54:44.560]  And I would say it.
[54:44.560 --> 54:45.400]  And they would leave.
[54:45.400 --> 54:46.440]  And then somebody would come over
[54:46.440 --> 54:47.760]  and ask the same damn question.
[54:47.760 --> 54:48.920]  And Maddie and Spence would look at me like,
[54:48.920 --> 54:50.680]  are you gonna say the same damn shit?
[54:50.680 --> 54:52.880]  And I'd be like, but he asked me the same question.
[54:52.880 --> 54:53.960]  And I was like, you know what I should do?
[54:53.960 --> 54:55.340]  I should record this shit.
[54:55.340 --> 54:56.300]  And then it all clicked in my head.
[54:56.300 --> 54:57.800]  It was like, you should record this shit.
[54:57.800 --> 54:59.640]  Like I really got, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:59.640 --> 55:01.400]  Get a microphone, record it, make a podcast.
[55:01.400 --> 55:03.240]  I was already doing a podcast with another guy
[55:03.240 --> 55:06.120]  about other totally non-cannabis related stuff.
[55:06.120 --> 55:07.680]  And I was like, well just fucking start recording it.
[55:07.680 --> 55:08.720]  Do a show about it.
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.600]  I'm so glad that clicked in your head.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.320]  Well, that's kind of, yeah.
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.440]  So I'm glad it happened.
[55:14.440 --> 55:17.600]  If listeners, if you've got other news stories
[55:17.600 --> 55:19.160]  or other topics you want us to cover,
[55:19.160 --> 55:20.040]  shoot us an email.
[55:20.880 --> 55:23.800]  I don't know if I'll do this many notes for your question,
[55:23.800 --> 55:26.000]  but we'll try to knock it out of the park for you.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.200]  All right, you guys, I feel like I've been rambling
[55:27.200 --> 55:29.640]  a long time about Patreon or about starting a podcast.
[55:29.640 --> 55:30.960]  Mike, let's wrap up this show.
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.040]  Send you home, you can go hang out with the kid.
[55:33.040 --> 55:34.720]  Eat that fancy food you got coming your way.
[55:34.720 --> 55:37.320]  Dude, I got some good delivery coming, yo.
[55:37.320 --> 55:40.760]  All right, thanks for hanging out with us, Mike.
[55:40.760 --> 55:43.000]  Yeah, man, thanks for having me, listeners.
[55:43.000 --> 55:43.840]  Thank you for listening.
[55:43.840 --> 55:45.560]  If you made it this far, I love you.
