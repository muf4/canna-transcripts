[00:16.960 --> 00:19.440]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.440 --> 00:21.320]  It's time for episode number 217
[00:21.320 --> 00:23.080]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.080 --> 00:26.760]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.760 --> 00:27.920]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.920 --> 00:29.120]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.120 --> 00:31.600]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.600 --> 00:33.560]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.560 --> 00:36.160]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.160 --> 00:39.200]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.200 --> 00:41.200]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.200 --> 00:43.040]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.040 --> 00:45.280]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.280 --> 00:46.920]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.920 --> 00:49.480]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.480 --> 00:53.520]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are smoking
[00:58.760 --> 01:00.400]  something delicious with me right now.
[01:00.400 --> 01:03.280]  I just took a fat dab of some Bear Dance butter
[01:03.280 --> 01:05.480]  from our friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.680]  This stuff is delicious.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.920]  I cannot even describe the flavor of this.
[01:08.920 --> 01:10.040]  It's, I'm gonna smell it again
[01:10.040 --> 01:12.240]  just to see if it makes me think of something.
[01:13.120 --> 01:16.160]  You know sometimes some herb has a dryer sheet
[01:16.160 --> 01:17.000]  sort of a smell.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.880]  This stuff has a dryer sheet kind of a smell happening.
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.520]  Something smooth, something silky,
[01:21.520 --> 01:23.920]  but then there's a sweet berry taste at the end of it
[01:23.920 --> 01:25.400]  that I'm really digging.
[01:25.400 --> 01:27.200]  I'm not usually a fan of the berry weed,
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.800]  but this, that dryer sheet smell
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.320]  on the high from this Bear Dance batter is amazing.
[01:32.320 --> 01:35.320]  It's got kind of a cheesecake sort of a texture.
[01:35.320 --> 01:38.160]  It looks like some cheesecake batter, some cake batter.
[01:38.160 --> 01:39.680]  The dab, when you take a dab,
[01:39.680 --> 01:42.960]  a little tiny dab goes a lot further than you would expect.
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.160]  It gives a lot of smoke, a lot of vapor.
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.200]  So a shout out to my friends at Apothecary Extracts
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.680]  for the amazing Bear Dance batter.
[01:50.800 --> 01:52.680]  You probably hear that it made me cough a little bit.
[01:52.680 --> 01:55.040]  For some reason, the dab I took made me sneeze.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.820]  You'll hear that in my throat for a couple of seconds,
[01:56.820 --> 02:00.120]  but I promise it will, I can't promise you I'm not positive,
[02:00.120 --> 02:03.880]  but I'm fairly certain that will fade away as time goes on.
[02:03.880 --> 02:05.840]  Hopefully the high fades a little more slowly
[02:05.840 --> 02:07.720]  than the chest congestion.
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.440]  Anyway, Bear Dance, let's see.
[02:11.440 --> 02:13.440]  Let's talk about the Bear Dance and why I bought it.
[02:13.440 --> 02:16.380]  I picked this up at Apothecary on Saturday.
[02:16.380 --> 02:18.080]  The reason I chose to buy the Bear Dance
[02:18.080 --> 02:20.720]  is because I was going to see the remaining members
[02:20.720 --> 02:23.120]  of the Grateful Dead, which are now known as Dead & Co.
[02:23.120 --> 02:24.360]  I thought it would only be appropriate
[02:24.360 --> 02:27.640]  to smoke Bear Dance hash at the Dead & Company concert.
[02:27.640 --> 02:29.680]  So let's talk a little bit about Dead & Co.
[02:29.680 --> 02:31.240]  before we get into some cannabis talk here.
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.320]  And we are going to talk about cannabis on this episode.
[02:33.320 --> 02:35.160]  I promise you.
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.680]  Saturday, I got to see Dead & Co.
[02:36.680 --> 02:38.760]  at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado.
[02:38.760 --> 02:41.400]  It was a beautiful day, it was a beautiful drive.
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.800]  Jenny Beth looked super beautiful.
[02:43.800 --> 02:46.560]  People could not quit staring at her all night, all day.
[02:46.560 --> 02:48.520]  It was a little bit ridiculous.
[02:48.520 --> 02:51.920]  She bought a dress that showed her features very well
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.040]  and she looked fucking great.
[02:53.040 --> 02:54.620]  So that was fun.
[02:54.620 --> 02:56.200]  We got up there, it was super sunshiny.
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.040]  It was kind of warm.
[02:57.040 --> 02:59.240]  It was actually really nice.
[02:59.240 --> 03:00.120]  The Grateful Dead came on.
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.160]  I keep calling them the Grateful Dead.
[03:01.160 --> 03:03.360]  It wasn't the Grateful Dead, it's the Dead & Co.
[03:03.400 --> 03:05.800]  It's from the Grateful Dead, the remaining,
[03:05.800 --> 03:07.240]  it's the original two drummers,
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.280]  Mickey Hart and Billy Kruitzman.
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.880]  And then you got Bobby Ware,
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.480]  original member of the Grateful Dead.
[03:12.480 --> 03:13.680]  And then over there on bass,
[03:13.680 --> 03:15.880]  they've got a dude by the name of Otil Burbridge.
[03:15.880 --> 03:16.720]  You may have heard of him.
[03:16.720 --> 03:19.040]  Dude plays a mean bass.
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.560]  Then they've got a dude named Jeff Chiminti on keyboards.
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.520]  And then there's this young guy
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.080]  that you might've heard of him before.
[03:24.080 --> 03:25.240]  His name is John Mayer.
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.240]  He plays guitar.
[03:28.080 --> 03:29.920]  You guys, I've talked about this on the podcast before.
[03:29.920 --> 03:31.760]  A long time ago when I heard that John Mayer
[03:31.760 --> 03:34.600]  was playing in Jerry's spot in the Grateful Dead,
[03:34.600 --> 03:37.000]  I was, I don't know what the feeling was,
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  but I doubted it and I wanted to be a hater.
[03:39.000 --> 03:39.840]  I was skeptical.
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.520]  I had skeptical hippo eyes right at the very beginning,
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.040]  but I've gone and seen it a few times now.
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.640]  I've actually caught a few shows
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.640]  of the newest version of the Grateful Dead
[03:48.640 --> 03:50.800]  and John Mayer nails it, you guys.
[03:50.800 --> 03:52.760]  If you want to be a critic, if you want to be a hater,
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.800]  go see a show and you will be blown away
[03:55.800 --> 03:58.480]  at the way John Mayer fits in with the Grateful Dead.
[03:58.480 --> 03:59.840]  I made a couple of jokes though.
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.360]  Mayer does bring a younger crowd
[04:02.360 --> 04:04.040]  and you can tell who's there to see Mayer
[04:04.040 --> 04:06.000]  because they don't put their phones down
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.200]  and they don't shut the fuck up during the concert.
[04:08.200 --> 04:09.260]  When I'm seeing the Grateful Dead
[04:09.260 --> 04:12.160]  or a Grateful Dead style band, they're jammy.
[04:12.160 --> 04:14.920]  They do psychedelic long extended songs.
[04:14.920 --> 04:16.640]  I want to be able to get in my head
[04:16.640 --> 04:18.000]  into this little bubble that happens
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.120]  when you're watching that and not be interrupted.
[04:20.120 --> 04:22.320]  And all these younger kids that are going to the shows now,
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.280]  they want to fucking talk over the jams.
[04:24.280 --> 04:26.920]  They want to ask you what song they're playing and shit.
[04:26.920 --> 04:27.760]  I don't dig it.
[04:27.760 --> 04:29.440]  Shut the fuck up when Jerry's playing.
[04:30.080 --> 04:30.920]  I'm going to go see Phish in a couple of weeks
[04:30.920 --> 04:32.080]  and I might get a shirt made that says,
[04:32.080 --> 04:33.400]  shut up when Phish is playing
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.280]  just because that's how I feel about it.
[04:35.280 --> 04:36.120]  I don't mean to be a bitch about it.
[04:36.120 --> 04:36.960]  It just sucks.
[04:36.960 --> 04:38.080]  You pay a lot of money to go see your favorite band
[04:38.080 --> 04:40.240]  and then some kids are right behind you
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.440]  just talking through the whole show.
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.260]  And you'll turn around and be like,
[04:42.260 --> 04:44.520]  hey bro, can you maybe not talk during this song?
[04:44.520 --> 04:45.640]  And then they think you're a dick
[04:45.640 --> 04:48.360]  because you want to hear whatever song you're trying to hear.
[04:48.360 --> 04:49.920]  Anyway, overall, it was a great time.
[04:49.920 --> 04:51.120]  There were enough cool ass people there
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.960]  to override all the young kids.
[04:52.960 --> 04:55.080]  John Mayer played the shit out of the show.
[04:56.080 --> 04:56.920]  Early in the show,
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.320]  there was a great version of Ramble on Rose.
[05:00.160 --> 05:03.000]  They played a really long version of Dark Star.
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.560]  One more Saturday night was awesome.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.440]  There were tons of great songs, honestly.
[05:06.440 --> 05:07.680]  You guys, I can't remember all the songs.
[05:07.680 --> 05:08.520]  I have them in a list here,
[05:08.520 --> 05:10.720]  but unless you're a deadhead, you probably don't care.
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.800]  And if you are a deadhead,
[05:11.800 --> 05:14.700]  you probably already know what they played that night.
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.240]  So we saw the show, they tore it up.
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.680]  One thing I do want to talk about,
[05:18.680 --> 05:21.680]  their current bass player is named Otil Burbridge.
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.000]  He's played with bands that you've heard of before.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.520]  You probably, I'm trying not to go too much
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.720]  into the music talking nerd out
[05:26.720 --> 05:29.000]  because music is one of my top three favorite things.
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.360]  I'm a cannabis and music-er.
[05:30.360 --> 05:31.680]  Two of my top three favorite things.
[05:31.680 --> 05:33.560]  Take a guess what the third one is.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.760]  Otil sang China Doll.
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.000]  This band has been together for,
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.560]  this version of this band has been together
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.680]  for a couple, maybe three years now.
[05:41.520 --> 05:43.680]  I don't remember exactly when they started,
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.180]  but they've been together for around two or three years
[05:46.180 --> 05:47.840]  and Otil has not sang.
[05:47.840 --> 05:51.520]  And a few nights ago in California, he sang China Doll.
[05:51.520 --> 05:53.880]  And I heard a couple of notes.
[05:53.880 --> 05:55.980]  When the band stops and they start tuning their guitars
[05:55.980 --> 05:57.520]  and everybody starts hitting the effects pedals
[05:57.520 --> 05:59.760]  on their guitar to get to the effects they need.
[05:59.760 --> 06:00.880]  And the keyboard guy warms up
[06:00.880 --> 06:02.700]  by playing a couple of notes of the next song.
[06:02.700 --> 06:04.880]  I'm really good at guessing what song it's about to be.
[06:04.880 --> 06:06.880]  Just the music nerd in me can spot it.
[06:06.880 --> 06:08.120]  And I looked at Jenny and I was like,
[06:08.120 --> 06:09.740]  they are going to play China Doll.
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.140]  And I knew that she was going to love it
[06:11.140 --> 06:13.880]  because she loves when they play slow, mellow songs.
[06:13.880 --> 06:16.720]  And she's been wanting to hear Otil sing.
[06:16.720 --> 06:18.560]  So I put my arm around her and I just smiled.
[06:18.560 --> 06:20.240]  And I was like, she is going to love this.
[06:20.240 --> 06:21.760]  Then we danced together for a couple of seconds.
[06:21.760 --> 06:22.840]  Then I just kind of stepped aside
[06:22.840 --> 06:23.800]  and let her just have her moment.
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.960]  She did that thing, you know, when girls are super happy
[06:25.960 --> 06:27.440]  and they're not sure if they want to smile or cry
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.100]  and they put their hands in kind of like a prey thing
[06:29.100 --> 06:30.200]  and they just touch their mouth with it.
[06:30.200 --> 06:32.040]  I'm doing it right now for some reason.
[06:32.040 --> 06:34.240]  She did that for the entire duration of the song.
[06:34.240 --> 06:35.800]  It was about six or eight minutes.
[06:35.800 --> 06:37.900]  She just smiled and bobbed back and forth.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.820]  Great moment.
[06:39.820 --> 06:42.240]  Anyway, yeah, saw the dead.
[06:42.240 --> 06:43.080]  It was awesome.
[06:43.080 --> 06:44.000]  They did China Doll.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.360]  One of my favorite parts of the show,
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.560]  they did China Cat into I Know You, Rider.
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.800]  And there's a part in the song, the line is,
[06:50.800 --> 06:53.540]  I wish I were a headlight on a northbound train.
[06:53.540 --> 06:57.240]  I'd shine my light through that cool Colorado rain.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.400]  They sang the Colorado rain part,
[06:59.400 --> 07:02.840]  that whole feel erupted with cheer.
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.660]  It was fucking awesome.
[07:03.660 --> 07:05.320]  I knew it was coming because I know the song.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.160]  So I was just looking around.
[07:06.160 --> 07:07.440]  I was like, this is going to be fucking rad.
[07:07.440 --> 07:09.600]  And it was pretty damn cool to hear the whole crowd
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.520]  just go, yeah.
[07:11.520 --> 07:13.160]  So that was pretty awesome.
[07:13.160 --> 07:14.680]  So the Grave of Lead, they tore it up.
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.880]  I will go next year.
[07:15.880 --> 07:17.360]  I had a good ass time.
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.960]  I look forward to seeing Fish here
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.460]  in just a couple of weeks.
[07:20.460 --> 07:21.900]  If you guys are going to see Fish,
[07:21.900 --> 07:22.840]  I would love to see you there.
[07:22.840 --> 07:23.840]  Let me know.
[07:23.840 --> 07:26.360]  I may have some seed packs in my pocket.
[07:26.360 --> 07:28.480]  When I go to shows, I put a couple of packs in my pockets
[07:28.480 --> 07:29.360]  and I just carry them around.
[07:29.360 --> 07:31.920]  And if you see me, you high five me, you hit me up.
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.200]  Maybe I got some seeds for you.
[07:33.200 --> 07:34.040]  You never know.
[07:34.040 --> 07:34.860]  It's Colorado.
[07:34.860 --> 07:36.560]  I can do that shit.
[07:36.560 --> 07:37.440]  Let's move forward.
[07:37.440 --> 07:38.360]  I bought a new printer.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.840]  Why is that significant?
[07:39.840 --> 07:41.600]  That is significant because now I am able
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.040]  to print off the emails that you guys send me
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.200]  and I can bring them to the podcast a little better
[07:47.200 --> 07:48.700]  than fumbling through my phone,
[07:48.700 --> 07:50.360]  trying to find the appropriate emails.
[07:50.360 --> 07:52.200]  Instead of doing that, they're right here.
[07:52.200 --> 07:53.680]  These are the messages I'm going to read.
[07:53.680 --> 07:54.920]  I don't have to go dig through my phone.
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.120]  There's no bullshit.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.720]  That makes me look, sound,
[07:57.720 --> 07:58.720]  and feel a little bit more professional.
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.920]  So I've got a printer.
[07:59.920 --> 08:02.600]  I'm able to just wirelessly shoot the messages
[08:02.600 --> 08:03.800]  from my phone right to the printer.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.800]  They come out, I can read them.
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.100]  We can do some shit.
[08:07.100 --> 08:08.720]  I like it.
[08:08.720 --> 08:11.400]  So my throat is still fucking up from that dab that I took.
[08:11.400 --> 08:13.920]  So I am going to, I'm going to take a drink
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.560]  and then honestly, I'll probably take another dab
[08:15.560 --> 08:17.780]  and just chill out for a second until my throat quits.
[08:17.780 --> 08:21.320]  Then we'll come back and we will read some of these emails.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.720]  We are going to start off with an email
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.400]  from a guy who calls himself St. Skinny.
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.320]  And then we're going to work our way
[08:27.320 --> 08:29.000]  through to Godfather Kush.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.760]  And then you never know where we might go after that.
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.180]  So ladies and gentlemen, you heat up a nail and take a dab
[08:35.180 --> 08:37.240]  and then drink some water or something natural,
[08:37.240 --> 08:38.740]  maybe some kombucha.
[08:38.740 --> 08:40.800]  And I'm going to do the same thing.
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.220]  And with the power of recording magic,
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.160]  I will be back in half a second.
[08:46.680 --> 08:47.640]  All right, podcast world.
[08:47.640 --> 08:50.240]  I hope you took a couple of fat dabs during my quick break.
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.040]  I know it was really brief.
[08:52.040 --> 08:54.200]  Let's see, before we get too far into the show,
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.880]  I need to do something special.
[08:55.880 --> 08:58.360]  I need to wish somebody very special,
[08:58.360 --> 08:59.900]  a very special happy birthday.
[08:59.900 --> 09:01.420]  I need to wish two people a happy birthday.
[09:01.420 --> 09:03.880]  One of them probably does not listen to the show.
[09:03.880 --> 09:05.800]  One of them definitely does.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.020]  Just a couple of days ago,
[09:07.020 --> 09:09.160]  it was my beautiful daughter, Maya's birthday.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.120]  Happy 14th birthday.
[09:11.120 --> 09:13.060]  I'm sure she doesn't listen to the show,
[09:13.060 --> 09:14.540]  but still I got to do it.
[09:14.540 --> 09:15.380]  I love you, kiddo.
[09:15.380 --> 09:16.760]  Happy birthday.
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.560]  Also, somebody that I know is listening,
[09:19.560 --> 09:21.320]  she's probably smoking a big old dab right now
[09:21.320 --> 09:22.760]  and listening to the podcast.
[09:22.760 --> 09:25.240]  The dabbing granny had a birthday today.
[09:25.240 --> 09:28.720]  Today is 6-19 and it is the dabbing granny's birthday.
[09:28.720 --> 09:30.360]  She is 62 years old today.
[09:30.360 --> 09:31.720]  I don't mind announcing how old she is
[09:31.720 --> 09:35.840]  because she did a 0.62 gram dab on Instagram
[09:35.840 --> 09:38.440]  for her 62nd birthday.
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.980]  Happy birthday, granny.
[09:39.980 --> 09:41.840]  We need to get you back on the show real soon, granny.
[09:41.840 --> 09:44.720]  So whenever you have time, drive down to Pueblo
[09:44.720 --> 09:47.080]  or I will drive up to Colorado Springs.
[09:47.080 --> 09:48.920]  Maybe we can go to the Canyon Canyon or somewhere
[09:48.920 --> 09:50.560]  and hang out for an hour or two.
[09:50.560 --> 09:52.560]  Do some, we can do some Facebook live,
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.640]  maybe some Instagram live, maybe some Periscope videos.
[09:55.640 --> 09:57.460]  And we certainly need to record
[09:57.460 --> 09:59.480]  a Grow From Your Heart podcast together.
[09:59.480 --> 10:02.160]  Shout out, huge happy birthday blessings to you.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.880]  I love you every day and I miss hanging out with you.
[10:03.880 --> 10:07.000]  Also, big high five to Kevin, the grumpy grandpa.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.040]  That's right, you guys.
[10:08.040 --> 10:10.400]  The dabbing granny has a partner in crime
[10:10.400 --> 10:11.640]  known as the grumpy grandpa.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.780]  They're a great couple.
[10:12.780 --> 10:14.440]  High five to both of you guys.
[10:14.440 --> 10:15.520]  Look forward to seeing you.
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.240]  All right, let's move forward with this podcast.
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.960]  I did tease that we were going to read some emails.
[10:18.960 --> 10:19.880]  I've got them in my hand.
[10:19.880 --> 10:20.720]  You hear it?
[10:20.720 --> 10:21.560]  I feel all professional.
[10:21.560 --> 10:23.760]  I feel like Dave Letterman or Jimmy Fallon
[10:23.760 --> 10:25.860]  or somebody popular and famous and on TV.
[10:25.860 --> 10:26.840]  I don't watch a lot of TV,
[10:26.840 --> 10:28.160]  so I was trying to fake some names.
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.880]  Jimmy Kimmel is who I was fucking thinking of
[10:29.880 --> 10:31.920]  and it took me a lot of time to come up with that.
[10:31.920 --> 10:33.420]  But I feel like Jimmy Kimmel or something,
[10:33.420 --> 10:34.600]  I feel like Dave Letterman.
[10:34.600 --> 10:35.800]  I'm flicking my pencil up in the air
[10:35.800 --> 10:37.720]  and letting it do flips and then catching it like a pimp
[10:37.720 --> 10:39.980]  and then marking down on the paper what I need.
[10:39.980 --> 10:41.480]  I'm going to quit rambling and I'll read emails.
[10:41.480 --> 10:42.840]  You guys, I took dabs.
[10:42.840 --> 10:44.400]  They're fucking working.
[10:44.400 --> 10:46.720]  All right, this first email,
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.280]  and by the way, if you'd like to email me,
[10:48.280 --> 10:49.240]  it's really easy.
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.080]  Send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[10:54.080 --> 10:54.920]  I'd love to hear from you.
[10:54.920 --> 10:56.280]  I'll read your emails on the show.
[10:56.280 --> 10:57.360]  Now that I've got a printer,
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.400]  I assume, I imagine, I predict
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.080]  I'll be reading a lot more emails
[11:01.080 --> 11:02.240]  and I'll get a lot more organized
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.560]  with a lot more shit also.
[11:04.600 --> 11:06.680]  Hashtag, they like it when we ramble.
[11:06.680 --> 11:08.120]  Anyway, this message goes like this.
[11:08.120 --> 11:10.800]  Hey Jeff, and then this dude put in parentheses,
[11:10.800 --> 11:12.800]  you can use my name, Saint Skinny
[11:12.800 --> 11:15.120]  or Saint or Skinny to refer to me.
[11:15.120 --> 11:16.360]  I'm not a picky dude.
[11:16.360 --> 11:17.240]  And then he goes on to say,
[11:17.240 --> 11:18.680]  I thought I'd share some of the music
[11:18.680 --> 11:21.440]  I like to listen to after getting nice and toasty.
[11:21.440 --> 11:23.680]  If you guys remember on the 420 episode,
[11:23.680 --> 11:25.840]  I asked people to email me, to tweet me,
[11:25.840 --> 11:26.960]  to message me in some way
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.200]  and let me know what kind of music
[11:28.200 --> 11:30.600]  they listen to after they smoke.
[11:30.600 --> 11:32.400]  The messages are still coming in.
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.040]  The podcast never goes away.
[11:34.040 --> 11:36.720]  So people will reply for a long time.
[11:36.720 --> 11:38.720]  And here is what my friend Saint Skinny said.
[11:38.720 --> 11:40.840]  He said, Cottonmouth Kings and Potluck
[11:40.840 --> 11:42.160]  are two of my main jams,
[11:42.160 --> 11:44.840]  but I also like things on the other end of the spectrum.
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.680]  The Clash's London's Calling
[11:46.720 --> 11:48.440]  is one of my all-time favorite albums
[11:48.440 --> 11:51.080]  right up there with Marty Robbins' Gunfighter ballads
[11:51.080 --> 11:53.000]  and Johnny Horton's greatest hits.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.240]  If you don't know Marty Robbins,
[11:54.240 --> 11:56.240]  El Paso is not a great song.
[11:56.240 --> 11:57.640]  He typed is not a great song,
[11:57.640 --> 11:59.360]  but I think he probably meant,
[12:00.280 --> 12:01.480]  if you don't know Marty Robbins,
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.640]  El Paso is a great song with some gorgeous guitar.
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.280]  If you don't know Johnny Horton,
[12:06.280 --> 12:08.520]  I'd suggest the Battle of New Orleans
[12:08.520 --> 12:10.620]  where they used a gator as a cannon.
[12:10.620 --> 12:12.120]  Guess where the powder went.
[12:12.120 --> 12:13.200]  So that makes more sense the way,
[12:13.200 --> 12:14.880]  yeah, I think he just got ahead of himself
[12:14.880 --> 12:16.280]  with the not in there.
[12:16.960 --> 12:19.160]  We've got to check out some Johnny Horton
[12:19.160 --> 12:20.400]  and some Marty Robbins.
[12:20.400 --> 12:22.400]  You guys, that's stuff we've got to listen to.
[12:22.400 --> 12:23.640]  St. Skinny recommended it.
[12:23.640 --> 12:24.460]  Give it a listen.
[12:24.460 --> 12:25.300]  Let me know what you think.
[12:25.300 --> 12:26.140]  I'll give it a listen.
[12:26.140 --> 12:27.920]  We'll have like a Rasta Jeff's Music Club
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.840]  sort of thing going on here.
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.680]  You never know.
[12:30.680 --> 12:32.600]  Maybe we'll discover one of our new favorite bands
[12:32.600 --> 12:35.080]  by finding out what our friends are listening to
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.600]  through the podcast.
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.760]  Dude, thanks for the email.
[12:37.760 --> 12:39.360]  It goes on to say, keep doing your thing, Jeff,
[12:39.360 --> 12:41.800]  and thanks for the shout out to my mom and I.
[12:41.800 --> 12:43.320]  She heard it coming home from the hospital
[12:43.320 --> 12:45.280]  and about had her in tears.
[12:45.280 --> 12:47.160]  Little things like that mean a lot.
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.960]  Mama Saint is in the hospital again,
[12:48.960 --> 12:50.560]  getting her bone marrow transplant
[12:50.560 --> 12:52.160]  to fight off the leukemia.
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.160]  So well wishes, prayers, and positive vibes are appreciated.
[12:57.360 --> 12:59.120]  If you've been listening to the show for a while,
[12:59.120 --> 13:01.360]  you guys probably have heard me read emails
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.800]  from St. Skinny before,
[13:02.800 --> 13:05.600]  and he was telling us about his mom being in the hospital.
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.680]  And I gave her a shout out on an episode
[13:07.680 --> 13:09.360]  and she happened to be in the car
[13:09.360 --> 13:12.600]  when St. Skinny was playing the episode and she heard it.
[13:12.600 --> 13:14.380]  And so I've been corresponding a little bit
[13:14.380 --> 13:16.420]  through emails with St. Skinny.
[13:16.420 --> 13:20.780]  And you guys, he said that she is in the hospital again,
[13:20.780 --> 13:24.740]  getting her a bone marrow transplant to fight off leukemia.
[13:24.740 --> 13:26.980]  That's gotta be a horrible experience.
[13:26.980 --> 13:30.380]  I know that I have never experienced anything that horrible
[13:30.380 --> 13:31.820]  and I hope I never have to.
[13:31.820 --> 13:33.620]  I'm grateful that I am healthy.
[13:33.620 --> 13:35.860]  I had a traumatic brain injury that fucked me up,
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.500]  but that just happened and then it was over.
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.900]  It's like I got hit and then I woke up all fucked up.
[13:39.900 --> 13:42.380]  I feel like getting bone marrow transplant
[13:42.380 --> 13:45.260]  is a long, slow battle and it's gotta be horrible.
[13:45.260 --> 13:47.300]  So whatever you believe in,
[13:47.300 --> 13:49.580]  I'm not gonna ask what you believe in.
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.380]  You could believe in Jesus,
[13:51.380 --> 13:52.980]  you could believe in Jairus to Farah,
[13:52.980 --> 13:54.320]  you could believe in Buddha,
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.000]  you could believe in rocks and trees,
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.260]  you could believe in nothing.
[13:57.260 --> 14:00.500]  But what I want you to do is think about St. Skinny's mom.
[14:00.500 --> 14:03.760]  Just imagine a nice looking lady, a mom,
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.060]  nice looking lady, you know,
[14:05.060 --> 14:06.380]  whatever you think a mom looks like in your head,
[14:06.380 --> 14:07.420]  imagine her.
[14:07.420 --> 14:09.420]  And then imagine this one being St. Skinny's mom
[14:09.420 --> 14:11.340]  and she needs bone marrow transplant
[14:11.380 --> 14:12.780]  and she feels like shit.
[14:12.780 --> 14:14.700]  And I want you guys just to send her some love
[14:14.700 --> 14:15.540]  from your heart.
[14:15.540 --> 14:16.380]  Because no matter what you believe in,
[14:16.380 --> 14:17.900]  what's your religion, you gotta love in your heart.
[14:17.900 --> 14:20.020]  So send a little bit of that to St. Skinny's mom
[14:20.020 --> 14:22.220]  just to get her through this bone marrow transplant
[14:22.220 --> 14:24.280]  because that's gotta fucking suck, you guys.
[14:24.280 --> 14:25.500]  If you're well enough to be at work
[14:25.500 --> 14:26.820]  or in your car or whatever,
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.860]  you got a second to send some love to this nice lady.
[14:28.860 --> 14:31.480]  So just do it right now.
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.320]  All together right now.
[14:32.320 --> 14:33.580]  It's only gonna take half a second.
[14:33.580 --> 14:34.420]  Here we go.
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.280]  Ah, did you feel it?
[14:37.280 --> 14:38.120]  I did it.
[14:38.120 --> 14:38.940]  I hope you did too.
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.460]  All right, St. Skinny, I hope it works.
[14:40.460 --> 14:42.580]  I hope that all that love lands on your mom.
[14:42.580 --> 14:44.580]  I hope she starts feeling a little better.
[14:44.580 --> 14:45.420]  What do I call her?
[14:45.420 --> 14:46.420]  Do I call her Mama St.?
[14:46.420 --> 14:48.340]  Yeah, that's what we're gonna call her, Mama St.
[14:48.340 --> 14:50.500]  Hope things go well for you.
[14:50.500 --> 14:53.140]  Let us know how you're using cannabis to deal with this
[14:53.140 --> 14:55.620]  because I've never dealt with leukemia
[14:55.620 --> 14:57.820]  and a bone marrow transplant.
[14:57.820 --> 14:59.300]  Sounds like you could teach me things.
[14:59.300 --> 15:01.760]  And if you don't mind, I'll share it with the listeners
[15:01.760 --> 15:03.500]  and we can kind of turn a positive
[15:03.500 --> 15:05.100]  out of a shitty negative thing.
[15:05.100 --> 15:06.020]  It's the best we could do.
[15:06.020 --> 15:07.180]  Best I could do.
[15:07.180 --> 15:09.900]  I hope you guys are well, St. and Mama.
[15:10.460 --> 15:12.620]  St. Skinny and Mama St.
[15:12.620 --> 15:14.500]  I kind of want to know how St. Skinny came up also
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.340]  to tell you the truth.
[15:15.340 --> 15:17.420]  We've been corresponding for a while, so share that with me.
[15:17.420 --> 15:18.340]  He ends the email with,
[15:18.340 --> 15:20.340]  stay red-eyed, smiley, and live life.
[15:20.340 --> 15:22.500]  Irie, you know I will do that.
[15:22.500 --> 15:23.700]  My life is great.
[15:23.700 --> 15:25.380]  I run a cannabis grow.
[15:25.380 --> 15:27.180]  I've got a beautiful, healthy daughter.
[15:27.180 --> 15:28.260]  I'm fairly healthy.
[15:28.260 --> 15:29.080]  I'm getting older.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.500]  I'm falling apart a little bit here and there,
[15:30.500 --> 15:31.980]  but I'm fairly healthy for the most part.
[15:31.980 --> 15:32.820]  I'm grateful for that.
[15:32.820 --> 15:34.140]  I'm thankful for that.
[15:34.140 --> 15:35.900]  So I'm living life, Irie.
[15:35.900 --> 15:38.100]  Man, I hope that you and your family are doing well
[15:38.100 --> 15:39.840]  with what you guys are dealing with.
[15:40.780 --> 15:41.840]  Much love, your guys' direction.
[15:41.840 --> 15:43.120]  Everybody send a little love to her.
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.300]  Do it again.
[15:44.300 --> 15:46.760]  All right, I'm gonna move forward with another email.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.320]  Skinny, thanks for the email, dude.
[15:48.320 --> 15:49.200]  I appreciate it.
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.120]  Much love, much respect.
[15:50.120 --> 15:51.480]  Shout out to your mom also.
[15:52.560 --> 15:54.120]  All right, let's move on to another email.
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.160]  This one is from a guy who calls himself Godfather Kush,
[15:57.160 --> 15:59.100]  and he says, good day to you, sir.
[15:59.100 --> 16:01.920]  I hope you are fully medicated and loving life right now.
[16:01.920 --> 16:03.200]  No doubt you are.
[16:03.200 --> 16:05.840]  Sorry in advance for this long email.
[16:05.840 --> 16:07.720]  Hey, don't be sorry for long emails.
[16:07.720 --> 16:09.120]  Sometimes it takes a lot of words
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.080]  to say how you feel.
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.800]  If anybody understands that, I do.
[16:13.800 --> 16:14.900]  It takes a lot of words sometimes.
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.000]  I'm rambling as shit right now,
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.600]  but let's get on with this email.
[16:18.600 --> 16:21.400]  He says, I'm a new listener and I dig the show for sure.
[16:21.400 --> 16:23.760]  I've listened to all episodes available on iTunes.
[16:23.760 --> 16:25.440]  It must have been meant to be
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.660]  because as soon as I ran out
[16:26.660 --> 16:27.940]  and caught up on the current episodes,
[16:27.940 --> 16:30.080]  you posted your first few shows.
[16:30.080 --> 16:32.240]  You guys, if you listen on Thursdays,
[16:32.240 --> 16:33.620]  I post old episodes.
[16:33.620 --> 16:36.520]  I've been going and making, it's usually three episodes.
[16:36.520 --> 16:39.120]  Sometimes I can fit four or five in a three hour file,
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.080]  but I've been going and getting old episodes
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.360]  and just sequentially putting them back out in order
[16:43.360 --> 16:46.160]  in chunks of three because the iTunes
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.840]  and Stitcher feed only hold 100 episodes.
[16:48.840 --> 16:51.260]  So every time I put out a new show, something falls out.
[16:51.260 --> 16:52.720]  So I'm putting them up in chunks of three,
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.600]  hoping I can get old episodes up so you can re-listen
[16:55.600 --> 16:58.440]  and still have fresh content up at the same time.
[16:58.440 --> 17:00.560]  And as I'm doing it, I'm making videos
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.700]  for the older episodes and putting those on YouTube
[17:03.700 --> 17:06.660]  because eventually the reposts are gonna fall out
[17:06.660 --> 17:09.900]  of the feed also, and I'm gonna have a lot of content
[17:09.900 --> 17:10.720]  is what's gonna happen.
[17:10.720 --> 17:13.100]  And a lot of the archives will end up on YouTube
[17:13.100 --> 17:15.860]  and the most recent 100-ish episodes
[17:15.860 --> 17:18.700]  will be on iTunes and Stitcher.
[17:18.700 --> 17:20.020]  But what I'm doing is putting out the old stuff
[17:20.020 --> 17:22.420]  because there's a lot of valuable content in there.
[17:22.420 --> 17:25.640]  A lot of my really written and thought out episodes
[17:25.640 --> 17:27.820]  were in about 55 to 100,
[17:27.820 --> 17:30.860]  were some of the most educational stuff that I put out.
[17:30.860 --> 17:32.940]  So they'll be back, they'll be back in the feed,
[17:32.940 --> 17:34.740]  they'll be up on YouTube.
[17:34.740 --> 17:37.420]  I'm really rambly, so I'm gonna get back to the email here.
[17:37.420 --> 17:39.460]  He said, I want you to know that your message and vibe
[17:39.460 --> 17:42.140]  really come across in a positive and uplifting way.
[17:42.140 --> 17:44.720]  Your character and attitude really makes it known
[17:44.720 --> 17:46.800]  that you are coming from such a real place in your heart
[17:46.800 --> 17:48.660]  and are a true caregiver.
[17:48.660 --> 17:50.320]  I really like the fact you breed strains
[17:50.320 --> 17:51.260]  with patience in mind
[17:51.260 --> 17:54.300]  and you don't just cross attractive strain names for fun.
[17:54.300 --> 17:56.660]  I can only imagine how many people you were able to bring
[17:56.660 --> 17:58.860]  to enlightenment when it comes to cannabis.
[17:58.860 --> 18:01.480]  Breaking stoner stereotypes is what this world needs
[18:01.480 --> 18:03.920]  and you were doing a great job.
[18:03.920 --> 18:05.000]  Hey, thank you.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.680]  The past like four sentences you said
[18:06.680 --> 18:07.520]  really mean a lot to me.
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.440]  I'm not trying to be an asshole.
[18:08.440 --> 18:10.160]  I'm really high and I really mean it.
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.200]  Like my character and attitude make it known
[18:13.200 --> 18:14.440]  that I'm coming from a real place.
[18:14.440 --> 18:15.820]  Yes, I'm not joking.
[18:15.820 --> 18:17.200]  I love cannabis.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.360]  I've done 217 episodes.
[18:19.360 --> 18:22.040]  I've put an episode out every Monday for three years
[18:22.040 --> 18:23.600]  because I'm dedicated and I love cannabis.
[18:23.600 --> 18:24.840]  I'm coming from a true place.
[18:24.840 --> 18:26.560]  Thank you for noticing.
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.720]  And I am a true caregiver, yes.
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.880]  I sometimes I just sit and listen to my friends talk
[18:32.880 --> 18:34.000]  and we smoke.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.820]  And I think sometimes just listening to a guy talk
[18:36.820 --> 18:37.920]  and nodding your head,
[18:37.920 --> 18:39.120]  sometimes it's all somebody needs.
[18:39.120 --> 18:41.400]  Somebody just wants to be heard occasionally.
[18:41.400 --> 18:43.000]  And if you can provide that
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.020]  and just also provide a little medical relief
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.840]  at the same time, you're really doing a lot.
[18:47.840 --> 18:50.440]  So being a caregiver, yes, I'm doing that.
[18:50.440 --> 18:51.320]  Thank you for noticing.
[18:51.320 --> 18:52.480]  It's not that hard, you guys.
[18:52.480 --> 18:55.360]  Just take a minute and just fucking sit down with somebody.
[18:55.360 --> 18:56.240]  You're doing it already.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.740]  You're just sitting there smoking with people anyway.
[18:57.740 --> 18:59.540]  Go find somebody that needs some help
[18:59.540 --> 19:01.340]  and smoke with them and just talk for an hour.
[19:01.340 --> 19:02.180]  You'll feel better.
[19:02.180 --> 19:03.260]  You'll feel like, oh man,
[19:03.260 --> 19:04.460]  I just sucked up all their problems.
[19:04.460 --> 19:06.240]  But then you might realize like,
[19:06.240 --> 19:07.820]  I don't have those problems.
[19:07.820 --> 19:08.940]  And then you'll be able to help them
[19:08.940 --> 19:10.520]  and everyone will feel a little bit better.
[19:10.520 --> 19:11.540]  So I'm gonna keep moving.
[19:11.540 --> 19:13.500]  He says he likes the fact that I breed strains
[19:13.500 --> 19:14.580]  with my patients in mind.
[19:14.580 --> 19:18.740]  And I don't just cross for attractive strain names.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.560]  That is true.
[19:19.560 --> 19:20.920]  I like to breed with a goal.
[19:20.920 --> 19:23.260]  I know what I'm looking for when I start breeding
[19:23.260 --> 19:26.060]  and I will scrap a project if it sucks, trust me.
[19:27.940 --> 19:30.420]  I'm not sure how many people I am able to bring
[19:30.420 --> 19:31.980]  to enlightenment about cannabis,
[19:31.980 --> 19:36.620]  but I hope just a few people would make me happy.
[19:36.620 --> 19:37.980]  I hope I'm reaching a large audience,
[19:37.980 --> 19:39.760]  but just a few would make me happy.
[19:39.760 --> 19:41.600]  As long as I'm changing one person a day,
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.620]  that would make me happy.
[19:42.620 --> 19:44.100]  If one person every day listens and goes,
[19:44.100 --> 19:44.940]  you know what?
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.780]  This pothead guy isn't that bad.
[19:45.780 --> 19:47.460]  We might learn some shit.
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.820]  That would make me happy.
[19:48.820 --> 19:51.460]  So breaking stoner stereotypes is what the world needs.
[19:51.460 --> 19:52.660]  Yes, it is.
[19:52.660 --> 19:53.680]  That's partly why I do this.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.500]  I know I've always been well-spoken
[19:56.540 --> 19:58.300]  and kind of a speech kind of a guy.
[19:58.300 --> 19:59.700]  I've been that dude.
[19:59.700 --> 20:02.900]  And I felt like it was kind of my responsibility to do this.
[20:02.900 --> 20:04.900]  So thank you for noticing that.
[20:04.900 --> 20:06.760]  And you're telling me that I'm doing a great job.
[20:06.760 --> 20:08.280]  Thank you.
[20:08.280 --> 20:10.480]  I know I've been at it for a long time and I have pride,
[20:10.480 --> 20:12.620]  but still being told you're doing a good job
[20:12.620 --> 20:16.580]  always feels good, no matter who it's from.
[20:16.580 --> 20:17.400]  So thank you, man.
[20:17.400 --> 20:18.240]  I appreciate that.
[20:18.240 --> 20:19.060]  And then you go on to say,
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.700]  I'm done blowing all that smoke your way.
[20:20.700 --> 20:23.700]  I just had to let you know that you have a new fan.
[20:23.700 --> 20:24.540]  Hey, thank you, man.
[20:24.540 --> 20:25.620]  I appreciate that.
[20:25.860 --> 20:28.060]  I will promise to give you quality content
[20:28.060 --> 20:29.300]  as long as I can.
[20:29.300 --> 20:30.460]  Then you keep going and you say,
[20:30.460 --> 20:32.220]  I went to the Dank team to get my hands
[20:32.220 --> 20:33.260]  on some of your art.
[20:33.260 --> 20:35.620]  They have a couple available, but not much
[20:35.620 --> 20:37.120]  and not really what I was looking for.
[20:37.120 --> 20:39.420]  I did however, get a freebie with an order
[20:39.420 --> 20:40.640]  and I'm pumped on it.
[20:40.640 --> 20:41.820]  I'm down here in New Mexico
[20:41.820 --> 20:43.980]  and I've heard you shout out Organtica
[20:43.980 --> 20:47.060]  and how they have a 30% plus a rise.
[20:47.060 --> 20:49.900]  So I'm hoping it comes through on your crosses.
[20:49.900 --> 20:51.700]  He's got my cookie cross.
[20:51.700 --> 20:54.780]  And he says, definitely looking for a short and potent,
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.220]  definitely looking for short and potent
[20:56.220 --> 20:57.580]  and we'll let you know what I get.
[20:57.580 --> 20:59.280]  Everything really does happen for a reason
[20:59.280 --> 21:00.540]  because even as I type this,
[21:00.540 --> 21:01.980]  I'm listening to the latest episode
[21:01.980 --> 21:04.620]  and you tease some upcoming seed and strain talk
[21:04.620 --> 21:05.900]  and I'm looking forward to it.
[21:05.900 --> 21:08.300]  Long story short, I'm a new fan of you
[21:08.300 --> 21:09.380]  and what you are doing.
[21:09.380 --> 21:11.820]  I wouldn't mind hearing more about what you are breeding
[21:11.820 --> 21:13.700]  and when you will replenish the Dank team
[21:13.700 --> 21:15.420]  with your fine craftsmanship.
[21:15.420 --> 21:16.640]  Brag more on your art.
[21:16.640 --> 21:17.780]  I don't mind it one bit
[21:17.780 --> 21:20.460]  and I'm sure other people like it too.
[21:20.460 --> 21:23.800]  Growers love and mom says, what the hell's a Rasta Jeff?
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.240]  And she got a hug anyway.
[21:25.240 --> 21:26.280]  That's funny.
[21:26.280 --> 21:27.840]  This dude said, take a fat dad
[21:27.840 --> 21:28.920]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.280]  And he told her, she didn't know
[21:30.280 --> 21:32.480]  what the hell a Rasta Jeff was.
[21:32.480 --> 21:33.520]  It's just me, mom.
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.900]  I'm cool, I'm harmless.
[21:35.760 --> 21:37.200]  There's so much to talk about here in this email.
[21:37.200 --> 21:38.180]  Let's back up.
[21:39.660 --> 21:42.360]  He got his hands on some of my art from the Dank team.
[21:42.360 --> 21:45.000]  You guys, I read genetic seeds are available
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.920]  at thedankteam.com.
[21:46.920 --> 21:48.880]  You can get a few things there.
[21:48.880 --> 21:50.260]  They had a deal for a little while.
[21:50.260 --> 21:51.280]  If you spent so much money,
[21:51.280 --> 21:53.240]  you would get some freebies of cookies and cream
[21:53.680 --> 21:55.720]  across to a rise, which has been named the cream.
[21:55.720 --> 21:58.480]  I'm not sure that they have that anymore.
[21:58.480 --> 22:03.120]  I can announce that I am in talks with a new vendor
[22:03.120 --> 22:06.440]  and I will soon announce that vendor on the podcast.
[22:06.440 --> 22:09.440]  And if you were looking for a new avenue
[22:09.440 --> 22:12.800]  to acquire I read genetic seeds, I have a new vendor.
[22:12.800 --> 22:14.760]  We're working on it.
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.360]  They'll get a shout out on the next episode
[22:16.360 --> 22:18.320]  or the next two episodes, depends on how things go.
[22:18.320 --> 22:19.400]  I don't want to make any promises.
[22:19.400 --> 22:21.060]  We're going to get that worked out.
[22:21.060 --> 22:24.260]  We should have another avenue for you to get those beans
[22:24.260 --> 22:26.320]  and they will have the cream available.
[22:26.320 --> 22:27.460]  They will have a rise.
[22:27.460 --> 22:28.600]  They will have cascade.
[22:28.600 --> 22:29.980]  They'll have morning dew.
[22:29.980 --> 22:31.180]  There'll be several great things there.
[22:31.180 --> 22:32.920]  If we can work that out.
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.820]  You're down there in New Mexico where Organica is.
[22:36.820 --> 22:39.340]  Shout out to my friends, Tim and Charlie,
[22:39.340 --> 22:41.740]  Charlie Jr. and everybody over at Organica.
[22:41.740 --> 22:43.100]  There's a bunch of great folks over there.
[22:43.100 --> 22:43.940]  I don't want to miss anybody.
[22:43.940 --> 22:45.980]  So I'm just going to stop with those three.
[22:45.980 --> 22:47.620]  They've got the 30% arise
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.520]  and you're hoping it comes through on the cookie cross.
[22:49.520 --> 22:51.320]  It will, it will come through on the cookie cross.
[22:51.320 --> 22:53.400]  I've got some cream growing in another room
[22:53.400 --> 22:55.200]  and it is frosty as hell.
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.140]  Also, you may be able to pick up some seeds at Organica
[22:59.140 --> 23:01.880]  in the very near future and they will have a rise
[23:01.880 --> 23:04.880]  and they will have the cream and they will have morning dew
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.940]  and they will have firefly.
[23:06.940 --> 23:10.280]  So keep your eyes out for that coming up at Organica.
[23:10.280 --> 23:12.480]  Also, sometimes Organica sells clones.
[23:12.480 --> 23:13.600]  So you may be able to go down there
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.840]  and get a clone of the arise that is testing at over 30% THC
[23:17.840 --> 23:21.040]  it's tested at 35% THC before the last couple of tests
[23:21.040 --> 23:22.560]  have been closer to 32.
[23:22.560 --> 23:25.360]  They test every batch and they're getting it dialed in.
[23:25.360 --> 23:27.780]  They'll get those 35s consistently,
[23:27.780 --> 23:29.800]  but go down there and check for a clone or call them.
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.340]  Maybe they've got a clone for you down at Organica.
[23:33.340 --> 23:34.880]  If you're going to get clones at Organica,
[23:34.880 --> 23:37.680]  try to get yourself a Zach Hayes clone.
[23:37.680 --> 23:40.320]  That plant was bred in honor of our friend, Zach,
[23:40.320 --> 23:42.600]  who passed away from cystic fibrosis.
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.480]  And that plant grows like a champ, smokes like a champ.
[23:45.480 --> 23:48.840]  And the medicine that it creates is potent and amazing.
[23:48.840 --> 23:50.000]  Anyway, I want to keep moving with the email.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.560]  Sorry, I'm rambling today.
[23:51.560 --> 23:54.080]  You said everything really does happen for a reason.
[23:54.080 --> 23:54.920]  Yes, you're right.
[23:54.920 --> 23:55.740]  It truly does.
[23:55.740 --> 23:57.460]  Everything does happen for a reason.
[23:57.460 --> 23:59.280]  Then you kind of asked me to talk a little bit
[23:59.280 --> 24:01.960]  about my breeding, which is perfect timing.
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.400]  Everything does happen for a reason.
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.560]  I got this at just the right time because on Father's Day,
[24:07.560 --> 24:09.880]  I will be doing a little pollination.
[24:09.880 --> 24:13.960]  In a room right now, I have got two arise males.
[24:13.960 --> 24:14.900]  That's the same plant.
[24:15.300 --> 24:16.860]  I've got two clones of it because I want to make sure
[24:16.860 --> 24:18.100]  to have enough pollen.
[24:18.100 --> 24:20.820]  I want to sprinkle a ton of pollen in that room.
[24:20.820 --> 24:22.740]  And I also want to collect a little bit of pollen
[24:22.740 --> 24:24.620]  to keep in a jar, which we will talk about
[24:24.620 --> 24:25.900]  in a future episode.
[24:25.900 --> 24:29.440]  But I've got arise, a male in flower.
[24:29.440 --> 24:31.800]  He is dumping pollen right now.
[24:31.800 --> 24:32.980]  He is dripping.
[24:32.980 --> 24:35.140]  Also, I have got, let's count.
[24:35.140 --> 24:39.440]  There are approximately 20 females in the flowering room
[24:39.440 --> 24:41.380]  that will be ready to receive pollen
[24:41.380 --> 24:42.860]  on the 18th of this month.
[24:42.860 --> 24:45.260]  Around the 18th would be ideal.
[24:45.260 --> 24:47.780]  A couple days before, a couple days after would not hurt.
[24:47.780 --> 24:49.480]  But I think the 18th was the day that I chose
[24:49.480 --> 24:50.500]  I wanted to do it.
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.540]  And that is Father's Day,
[24:51.540 --> 24:53.860]  so it's going to work out very well.
[24:53.860 --> 24:55.460]  The girls that will be in that room,
[24:55.460 --> 24:56.860]  the female plants that are in there,
[24:56.860 --> 24:58.180]  there's grateful dog in there.
[24:58.180 --> 25:00.540]  The arise to grateful dog makes morning dew.
[25:00.540 --> 25:01.860]  There's lemon skunk in there.
[25:01.860 --> 25:05.180]  Arise to lemon skunk makes firefly.
[25:05.180 --> 25:06.980]  Then stuff I've never done.
[25:06.980 --> 25:08.480]  There is a kalonji cush.
[25:08.480 --> 25:11.580]  So we will have kalonji cush cross to arise.
[25:11.580 --> 25:12.420]  There's capeltons.
[25:12.420 --> 25:14.740]  You'll have capelton cross to arise.
[25:14.740 --> 25:15.740]  Let me tell you what those are.
[25:15.740 --> 25:20.660]  Kalonji cush is Tahoe OG cross to the grateful dog.
[25:20.660 --> 25:23.600]  The capelton is white widow cross to the grateful dog.
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.160]  So I'm going to cross those to the arise.
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.460]  I see a lot of great things happening there.
[25:28.460 --> 25:31.860]  They'll put out some really cushy, stanky phenotypes.
[25:31.860 --> 25:33.240]  I'm hoping that the arise male
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.020]  puts a little more weight on both of them.
[25:36.020 --> 25:38.380]  The capelton already puts out huge buds.
[25:38.380 --> 25:41.020]  I'm curious to see how big those buds are going to get
[25:41.020 --> 25:43.100]  and what that might do.
[25:43.100 --> 25:46.560]  Also in that same room, there's a redheaded stranger.
[25:46.560 --> 25:48.900]  I like the way the redheaded stranger grows.
[25:48.900 --> 25:51.520]  It branches out a little more than the arise, which I like.
[25:51.520 --> 25:54.220]  It would kind of improve the structure of the arise.
[25:54.220 --> 25:57.120]  So arise and redheaded stranger,
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.540]  I plan to call that red rocket.
[25:59.540 --> 26:01.500]  There's a flow plant in there that will take pollen.
[26:01.500 --> 26:03.060]  There's also a platinum tangy,
[26:03.060 --> 26:04.780]  a very small platinum tangy plant.
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.440]  I just want to make a few seeds to play with it,
[26:06.440 --> 26:09.580]  see if I can find a very orange phenotype.
[26:09.580 --> 26:10.800]  There are a lot of great plants in there.
[26:11.580 --> 26:14.320]  So I do have a breeding project happening right now.
[26:14.320 --> 26:17.680]  The pollination should happen around the 18th.
[26:17.680 --> 26:18.880]  You know what I could do?
[26:18.880 --> 26:20.800]  I've been trying to think of a good name
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.840]  for flow crossed to the arise.
[26:24.840 --> 26:26.280]  I would like to think of a word
[26:26.280 --> 26:28.560]  that means like the upward flow of energy
[26:28.560 --> 26:30.320]  or uprising energy.
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.880]  I know I just said the word uprising.
[26:31.880 --> 26:32.860]  That may work.
[26:34.040 --> 26:36.600]  Something, so you guys, if you have any suggestions
[26:36.600 --> 26:39.560]  to help me name flow to arise,
[26:39.560 --> 26:41.500]  flow is the girl, arise is the male,
[26:42.640 --> 26:43.560]  send me your suggestions.
[26:43.560 --> 26:45.600]  You can tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[26:45.600 --> 26:46.480]  You can send me an email.
[26:46.480 --> 26:48.440]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[26:48.440 --> 26:52.360]  or on Facebook, it is the grow from your heart podcast.
[26:52.360 --> 26:54.160]  Kind of want to hear your opinion.
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.120]  And since I'm talking about it,
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.360]  white widow times arise needs a name also.
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.320]  There's a white widow girl in that room.
[26:59.320 --> 27:01.340]  So white widow to arise needs a name.
[27:02.320 --> 27:03.360]  I've already done that before.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.340]  I've got seeds of that.
[27:04.340 --> 27:05.600]  I've just never bothered to name it.
[27:05.600 --> 27:07.960]  I haven't grown the seeds because I haven't had room.
[27:07.960 --> 27:09.160]  There are only a few of them.
[27:09.680 --> 27:11.160]  Sometimes I just run little tiny plants
[27:11.160 --> 27:12.360]  for my first breeding project.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.920]  Then I'll grow them and see if they're worth a shit.
[27:13.920 --> 27:15.880]  And then I'll make a whole bunch more.
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.480]  In the same room for the breeding,
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.160]  there is a female prodagium is how I think you say it.
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.520]  That was bred by Colin Gordon of the Ethos Collective.
[27:24.520 --> 27:27.120]  It is a very orangey.
[27:27.120 --> 27:30.820]  It's got like a orange cleaner kind of a smell to it
[27:30.820 --> 27:34.200]  with a little bit of, you know how a car tire shop
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.640]  or anywhere you get your car worked on
[27:35.640 --> 27:38.300]  has like a hint of like an oil sort of a smell.
[27:38.300 --> 27:39.540]  It's got that smell to it.
[27:39.540 --> 27:41.020]  It's oranges and oil.
[27:41.020 --> 27:42.700]  I like it in a sick way.
[27:42.700 --> 27:44.300]  It's got a really great aroma to it.
[27:44.300 --> 27:46.040]  So there's a prodagium in there.
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.780]  There's a Jeff's OG in there.
[27:47.780 --> 27:50.960]  So we're gonna need a name for Jeff's OG to arise.
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.560]  And also there's a Hell's OG in there.
[27:53.560 --> 27:55.460]  So there will be Hell's OG cross to arise.
[27:55.460 --> 27:57.060]  And I think I have a name for that.
[27:57.060 --> 27:58.020]  I'm not certain yet,
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.860]  but I want to grow it and see what it looks like.
[27:59.860 --> 28:02.220]  But I'm pretty sure I've got a cool name for that.
[28:02.220 --> 28:04.820]  So those will take pollen on the 18th ish.
[28:04.820 --> 28:06.660]  I like to hit the plants with pollen
[28:06.660 --> 28:08.380]  sometime around day 25.
[28:08.380 --> 28:11.820]  There's a little window between like day 23 and day 32 ish
[28:11.820 --> 28:12.780]  that they can take pollen.
[28:12.780 --> 28:15.980]  It's usually about day 25 that most of them really like it.
[28:15.980 --> 28:19.040]  I like to do it when the pistils are nice and fat.
[28:19.040 --> 28:20.740]  Some people will put the females,
[28:20.740 --> 28:22.460]  different females in the room at different times
[28:22.460 --> 28:23.300]  to time them.
[28:23.300 --> 28:25.500]  Some people just throw them all in there at the same time.
[28:25.500 --> 28:26.980]  These plants are kind of small.
[28:26.980 --> 28:28.080]  They are not huge plants.
[28:28.080 --> 28:29.940]  I'm not trying to make a whole bunch of seed.
[28:29.940 --> 28:32.500]  I just want to see what some new crosses do.
[28:32.500 --> 28:33.320]  And while I'm at it,
[28:33.320 --> 28:35.540]  I'm just repeating some old crosses
[28:35.540 --> 28:38.100]  to make it a little bit more seed stock for myself.
[28:39.580 --> 28:42.260]  So I'm going to hit all the plants at the same time
[28:42.260 --> 28:44.100]  on the 18th,
[28:44.100 --> 28:46.140]  and then I'll let them grow for about five or six weeks.
[28:46.140 --> 28:47.740]  And I'll start pulling out one seed
[28:47.740 --> 28:48.900]  from the bottom of each plant,
[28:48.900 --> 28:51.140]  seeing how hard it is, how dark it is.
[28:51.140 --> 28:52.820]  I'm looking to see if it's getting tiger striped.
[28:52.820 --> 28:55.500]  If it's still white and soft, it's obviously not done.
[28:55.500 --> 28:57.660]  When they start getting hard, that's when they're done.
[28:57.660 --> 28:59.980]  I'll flush them, cut down the plants, let them dry,
[28:59.980 --> 29:01.460]  pull the seeds out.
[29:01.460 --> 29:04.060]  And then I will test most of them myself
[29:04.060 --> 29:06.340]  is how I usually do the first batch.
[29:06.340 --> 29:07.700]  Just run them myself.
[29:07.700 --> 29:10.420]  It takes me a little while, but then I find what I like,
[29:10.420 --> 29:12.260]  and I make more and more and more of those.
[29:12.260 --> 29:13.460]  And as I make more,
[29:13.460 --> 29:16.040]  I usually throw a couple of new things in the room.
[29:16.040 --> 29:18.420]  So say I'm trying to make a whole bunch of firefly.
[29:18.420 --> 29:21.380]  I'll do a whole light of lemon skunk females,
[29:21.380 --> 29:24.380]  but then I'll put one of something new in there
[29:24.380 --> 29:26.260]  that's never been pollinated by the arise,
[29:26.260 --> 29:28.740]  just so that I can create something new while I'm at it.
[29:28.740 --> 29:30.540]  That way I make production
[29:30.540 --> 29:33.020]  plus a new personal cross to play with.
[29:33.020 --> 29:35.740]  Just try to keep things new as a breeder, as a grower,
[29:35.740 --> 29:36.740]  you gotta keep it new.
[29:36.740 --> 29:39.580]  Keeps your mind excited, keeps your heart into it,
[29:39.580 --> 29:40.420]  keeps you passionate.
[29:40.420 --> 29:41.980]  So that's what I'm doing with my breeding project.
[29:41.980 --> 29:43.900]  I hope I answered your question there, Godfather Kush.
[29:43.900 --> 29:45.660]  That was a lot of rambling.
[29:45.660 --> 29:49.580]  Your long email was met with a long reply.
[29:49.580 --> 29:50.780]  I really appreciate it.
[29:50.780 --> 29:53.340]  All right, I feel like I've got time for one more email.
[29:53.340 --> 29:55.320]  This one is gonna set me off on a long rant.
[29:55.320 --> 29:56.460]  So I'm gonna press pause.
[29:56.460 --> 29:57.580]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[29:57.580 --> 29:58.740]  I'm gonna take a dab.
[29:58.740 --> 30:01.060]  And then I will be back with an email
[30:01.060 --> 30:04.380]  about traumatic brain injuries and cannabis use.
[30:04.380 --> 30:05.220]  Hang tight.
[30:08.580 --> 30:10.500]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[30:10.500 --> 30:12.780]  I took way too big of a dab.
[30:12.780 --> 30:13.620]  I'm all sweaty.
[30:13.620 --> 30:18.620]  I feel like I am red and I am sweating behind my knees.
[30:18.820 --> 30:22.180]  I've never felt this sweat behind my knee before,
[30:22.180 --> 30:24.220]  but right now I can notice that.
[30:24.220 --> 30:25.740]  I don't know if I've never done that
[30:25.740 --> 30:26.820]  or if I've just never noticed it
[30:26.820 --> 30:28.740]  or if I'm finally just high enough to notice that,
[30:28.740 --> 30:31.380]  but yeah, there's sweat back there.
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.220]  I've never done that before.
[30:32.220 --> 30:35.260]  I'm wearing shorts and I'm still sweating on my legs.
[30:35.260 --> 30:37.500]  That's a good dab.
[30:37.500 --> 30:38.340]  Anyway, before the break,
[30:38.340 --> 30:40.020]  I promised that I would read an email
[30:40.020 --> 30:41.740]  about traumatic brain injuries
[30:41.740 --> 30:45.100]  because if you've been a long time podcast listener,
[30:45.100 --> 30:47.580]  you know that in April of 2015,
[30:47.580 --> 30:50.580]  I experienced a traumatic brain injury.
[30:50.580 --> 30:52.480]  I simply hit my head.
[30:52.480 --> 30:53.720]  I hit my head real hard.
[30:53.720 --> 30:54.980]  I hit it in just the right spot
[30:54.980 --> 30:57.420]  and I knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[30:57.540 --> 30:59.780]  I gave myself a subdural hematoma,
[30:59.780 --> 31:01.220]  which is just a big word for,
[31:01.220 --> 31:03.860]  I had a bruise on my brain.
[31:03.860 --> 31:06.580]  There is a pot, there's your brain
[31:06.580 --> 31:07.700]  and then there's a pocket of fluid
[31:07.700 --> 31:10.220]  and then there's your skull and then there's your skin
[31:10.220 --> 31:13.960]  and I had like a bubble between the brain
[31:13.960 --> 31:15.220]  and that layer of fluid.
[31:15.220 --> 31:16.300]  It was kind of acting funny.
[31:16.300 --> 31:17.940]  It was putting pressure on parts of my brain
[31:17.940 --> 31:21.380]  that were making me say and think weird shit.
[31:21.380 --> 31:23.440]  It really fucked me up.
[31:23.440 --> 31:25.140]  I am not suicidal at this time.
[31:25.380 --> 31:28.020]  I've never really wanted to kill myself
[31:28.020 --> 31:30.420]  but during that brain injury,
[31:30.420 --> 31:32.760]  there were times when my brain was telling me
[31:32.760 --> 31:35.460]  that I should hurt myself and I knew better
[31:35.460 --> 31:37.880]  but it was all related to a brain injury.
[31:37.880 --> 31:39.860]  I was slowed.
[31:39.860 --> 31:41.340]  I couldn't speak as well as normal.
[31:41.340 --> 31:43.360]  If you listen to the podcast from that time period,
[31:43.360 --> 31:48.360]  April of 2015, May of 2015, June, 2015,
[31:48.820 --> 31:50.120]  I was goofy.
[31:50.120 --> 31:52.340]  I smacked the shit out of myself.
[31:52.340 --> 31:54.020]  I couldn't do math properly.
[31:54.020 --> 31:54.980]  I couldn't drive right.
[31:55.820 --> 31:57.060]  I couldn't write podcasts properly.
[31:57.060 --> 32:01.140]  I was fucked up and it was making my attitude bad
[32:01.140 --> 32:03.500]  and not being able to perform properly
[32:03.500 --> 32:06.000]  and remember a sentence and remember what was happening
[32:06.000 --> 32:07.860]  was making me have weird thoughts
[32:07.860 --> 32:10.020]  of doing weird shit to myself.
[32:10.020 --> 32:13.140]  So a traumatic brain injury can fuck your life up.
[32:14.540 --> 32:16.180]  I felt like shit for days.
[32:16.180 --> 32:18.500]  It felt like, so at first,
[32:18.500 --> 32:20.540]  I couldn't even tell what was wrong with me.
[32:20.540 --> 32:21.460]  I was so fucked up.
[32:21.460 --> 32:22.360]  I was just broken.
[32:22.360 --> 32:24.920]  I didn't know which way was up, which way was down.
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.600]  I wasn't hungry.
[32:26.600 --> 32:27.420]  I wasn't thirsty.
[32:27.420 --> 32:28.260]  I wasn't hot.
[32:28.260 --> 32:29.280]  I wasn't cold.
[32:29.280 --> 32:30.940]  My friends would have to tell me to drink water
[32:30.940 --> 32:33.760]  because my gums would just be stuck to my teeth.
[32:33.760 --> 32:34.600]  Like fire marshal Bill,
[32:34.600 --> 32:36.480]  remember fire marshal Bill had that dumb expression
[32:36.480 --> 32:38.000]  where his teeth were just pasted
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.760]  or his gums were pasted to his teeth.
[32:39.760 --> 32:41.920]  I looked like that and didn't even know it
[32:41.920 --> 32:43.320]  because of a brain injury.
[32:43.320 --> 32:45.800]  My little signals in my brain that would say,
[32:45.800 --> 32:48.700]  hey dude, you're thirsty, that signal never went off.
[32:48.700 --> 32:51.280]  I would sound like this on the show.
[32:52.400 --> 32:54.320]  And it would just be my mouth so dry
[32:54.720 --> 32:55.960]  and my lips and teeth and my tongue
[32:55.960 --> 32:57.760]  were just all stuck as one piece.
[32:57.760 --> 33:01.160]  I couldn't even tell because I was broken in my brain.
[33:01.160 --> 33:03.360]  I would go outside and it was cold as fuck
[33:03.360 --> 33:04.740]  and I wouldn't even have shoes on.
[33:04.740 --> 33:07.600]  Everybody else would be shivering and cold with a jacket.
[33:07.600 --> 33:08.720]  And I'd be like, oh, it's fine out here.
[33:08.720 --> 33:10.280]  And they'd be like, you're fucking crazy.
[33:10.280 --> 33:11.880]  And I didn't get a cold.
[33:11.880 --> 33:13.220]  I didn't get sick from it.
[33:13.220 --> 33:14.280]  That was tremendous.
[33:15.680 --> 33:17.720]  There would be times I would just be sitting here
[33:17.720 --> 33:20.860]  at this table and I would forget where the fuck I was
[33:20.860 --> 33:21.840]  and what I was saying.
[33:21.840 --> 33:23.440]  There have been points on the podcast
[33:23.440 --> 33:24.600]  when I was recording at that time
[33:24.600 --> 33:27.320]  where I had to stop and rewind and listen
[33:27.320 --> 33:29.000]  to what I was saying and try to figure out
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.060]  what the hell I was even talking about.
[33:31.060 --> 33:33.980]  So I was broken from a traumatic brain injury, you guys.
[33:33.980 --> 33:36.080]  I have recovered quite well.
[33:36.080 --> 33:38.260]  There are still problems in my body from that.
[33:38.260 --> 33:40.540]  There are still problems in my brain from it.
[33:40.540 --> 33:43.480]  I get the normal forgetful shit that people get.
[33:43.480 --> 33:45.800]  I get the normal problems that people have
[33:45.800 --> 33:47.440]  when you're like, what was that?
[33:47.440 --> 33:49.840]  But I also have other things that I can tell
[33:49.840 --> 33:52.020]  are from the brain injury because they're new
[33:52.020 --> 33:54.460]  and they didn't happen before that.
[33:54.460 --> 33:56.620]  I went through weird attitude changes.
[33:56.620 --> 33:59.020]  I was very impulsive for a little while.
[33:59.020 --> 34:01.140]  I was quite angry for a little while.
[34:03.700 --> 34:06.500]  I was ornery is the only word that I could use to describe it.
[34:06.500 --> 34:08.780]  I was just fucking with people and just being a smart ass
[34:08.780 --> 34:09.820]  and just trolling people.
[34:09.820 --> 34:11.500]  And it was all just from a brain injury
[34:11.500 --> 34:13.460]  just triggering me to do weird shit.
[34:13.460 --> 34:15.180]  And I read books and talked to doctors
[34:15.180 --> 34:16.780]  and I did all the right things.
[34:16.780 --> 34:20.060]  And the books and the internet experiences told me
[34:20.060 --> 34:22.380]  that there are phases you go through from a brain injury
[34:22.380 --> 34:24.380]  and I was going through them properly.
[34:24.380 --> 34:26.700]  If I didn't have support from my friends
[34:26.700 --> 34:28.640]  and the internet telling me that shit was going right,
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.900]  I would have been really scared
[34:29.900 --> 34:33.180]  because not knowing there were parts of my life
[34:33.180 --> 34:34.020]  that are missing.
[34:34.020 --> 34:36.820]  There's from the month after that,
[34:36.820 --> 34:38.980]  I probably only know I can put together
[34:38.980 --> 34:42.220]  one full week of shit and I don't know the rest of it.
[34:42.220 --> 34:46.800]  And that is I may be slightly a control freak.
[34:46.800 --> 34:48.100]  I'm the boss at my job.
[34:48.100 --> 34:49.620]  I own my own business.
[34:50.140 --> 34:50.980]  I host my own show.
[34:50.980 --> 34:52.900]  I've got some control freak shit going on.
[34:52.900 --> 34:55.400]  I did not have that after my brain injury
[34:55.400 --> 34:56.880]  and it really fucked me up.
[34:56.880 --> 34:58.500]  So I wanna get to this person's email.
[34:58.500 --> 35:00.820]  I was just trying to let everybody know
[35:00.820 --> 35:02.360]  I did have a serious brain injury.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.780]  So when I talk about this, I'm not talking out my ass.
[35:04.780 --> 35:06.300]  What I was getting to, I just looped back around.
[35:06.300 --> 35:07.580]  I know I started saying something.
[35:07.580 --> 35:09.700]  It felt like somebody had put,
[35:09.700 --> 35:11.660]  at first I couldn't, it fucking sucked.
[35:11.660 --> 35:12.860]  I was cloudy, I couldn't think.
[35:12.860 --> 35:15.420]  Then the pain set in on day two.
[35:15.420 --> 35:17.060]  When I hit my head, it didn't hurt.
[35:17.060 --> 35:18.220]  It was just like, what the fuck happened?
[35:18.220 --> 35:19.240]  I was out.
[35:19.860 --> 35:20.700]  I was confused.
[35:20.700 --> 35:22.320]  My body and my brain weren't connecting.
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.760]  The next day it fucking hurt.
[35:24.760 --> 35:27.680]  It literally felt like I smacked my head on the wall.
[35:27.680 --> 35:28.520]  And I did.
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.800]  And I took a couple dabs and it made it hurt worse
[35:32.800 --> 35:35.080]  because it increased my blood pressure.
[35:35.080 --> 35:36.520]  And with that increased blood pressure,
[35:36.520 --> 35:38.200]  I could just feel the head wound just going,
[35:38.200 --> 35:39.880]  thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk.
[35:39.880 --> 35:41.540]  And I could fucking hear it.
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.620]  One thing I did not mention about my brain injury,
[35:43.620 --> 35:44.920]  and I don't like to talk about it.
[35:44.920 --> 35:47.480]  It kind of bothers me and it embarrasses me,
[35:47.480 --> 35:49.720]  but I love you guys and I think you love me back.
[35:49.720 --> 35:50.840]  So if you hear my voice get weird,
[35:50.840 --> 35:52.520]  it's because I'm nervous about this.
[35:52.520 --> 35:54.280]  I hear noise in my head.
[35:54.280 --> 35:55.360]  I'm not crazy.
[35:55.360 --> 35:56.720]  Doctors say it's okay.
[35:56.720 --> 35:57.560]  They know it's there.
[35:57.560 --> 35:58.920]  Psychologists know it's there.
[35:58.920 --> 36:00.080]  I'm not fucking hiding it.
[36:00.080 --> 36:01.680]  There is noise in my head.
[36:01.680 --> 36:04.120]  It sounds like when you go to a guitar center
[36:04.120 --> 36:05.920]  and that kid doesn't know how to play the guitars
[36:05.920 --> 36:08.000]  and he plugs it in and turns on the amp and it goes,
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.520]  grrr.
[36:09.520 --> 36:12.340]  It's what it sounds like in my head sometimes, not always,
[36:12.340 --> 36:13.440]  but sometimes.
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.400]  Sometimes it sounds like,
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.120]  you know when the air conditioner is just real loud
[36:17.120 --> 36:18.440]  and you're trying to hear your friend talk,
[36:18.440 --> 36:20.040]  but the air conditioner is just going,
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.120]  whoo, too loud.
[36:22.120 --> 36:24.980]  Or maybe the torch in the background like this.
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.280]  I just hear a sound like that.
[36:26.280 --> 36:28.000]  It's just in my head.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.280]  Just like that.
[36:29.280 --> 36:30.800]  Just constantly in my head.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.800]  And it comes and goes.
[36:31.800 --> 36:34.000]  It's not constant, but when it starts,
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.640]  it could last for days.
[36:35.640 --> 36:36.560]  So there's shit like that.
[36:36.560 --> 36:37.560]  There are effects like that
[36:37.560 --> 36:39.040]  that are still happening in my head.
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.920]  I'm dealing with it and I'm getting a lot better.
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.080]  It gets better every day I think,
[36:44.080 --> 36:45.880]  but sometimes shit pops up.
[36:45.880 --> 36:48.280]  So Sativa dabs were making my head throb
[36:48.280 --> 36:51.000]  and it was making that noise really loud.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  Spencer, Garden of Weed and Spencer and Maddie,
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.560]  shout out to Spence and Maddie.
[36:55.560 --> 36:58.360]  I went to their house and they're like,
[36:58.360 --> 37:00.000]  bro, you need some CBD in your life.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.240]  And I was like, give me CBD.
[37:01.240 --> 37:03.240]  If that's what you think I need, I will do it.
[37:03.240 --> 37:05.520]  And they gave me a couple dabs of CBD.
[37:05.520 --> 37:08.000]  And with the first dab, so I described the pain.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.760]  It felt like I had a belt around my head
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.200]  or a vice around my head, right around my temple region.
[37:14.200 --> 37:15.960]  And when I took the dabs of CBD,
[37:17.360 --> 37:19.920]  it felt like the belt loosened up a little.
[37:19.920 --> 37:22.400]  It just like, ah.
[37:22.400 --> 37:26.960]  It just felt, so the CBD was slowly making it loosen up.
[37:26.960 --> 37:27.920]  So I'm gonna read this email
[37:27.920 --> 37:29.800]  and then I'm gonna talk a lot more about
[37:29.800 --> 37:32.080]  my experience with cannabis and a brain injury
[37:32.080 --> 37:33.600]  and what I can recommend for you.
[37:33.600 --> 37:34.840]  But let's get to the email.
[37:34.880 --> 37:35.720]  It goes like this.
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.720]  Hey Jeff, I hope all is well.
[37:36.720 --> 37:37.880]  No Grow Talk today.
[37:37.880 --> 37:39.320]  A more serious note.
[37:39.320 --> 37:42.160]  I am hoping you can provide me with some info
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.400]  or links as to the benefits of cannabis and TBI.
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.400]  TBI is traumatic brain injury.
[37:47.400 --> 37:49.960]  A close friend of mine was in a motorcycle accident
[37:49.960 --> 37:52.280]  and has a serious TBI and is being treated
[37:52.280 --> 37:53.520]  at Craig Hospital.
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.760]  He would like to start using cannabis medically
[37:55.760 --> 37:57.840]  for the TBI when he gets released.
[37:57.840 --> 38:00.080]  I would like to grow some cannabis for him to use,
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.200]  but have no idea what strains are beneficial for TBI
[38:03.200 --> 38:05.920]  or what method of ingestion is best.
[38:05.920 --> 38:07.160]  Thank you for the info.
[38:07.160 --> 38:08.600]  Very much appreciated.
[38:08.600 --> 38:09.520]  And he signs his name,
[38:09.520 --> 38:11.560]  which I'm not sure if he wants me to say.
[38:11.560 --> 38:13.360]  I'm gonna call you Eminem right now.
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.080]  I just see you have a name for the podcast.
[38:15.080 --> 38:16.480]  Eminem, thanks for the great email.
[38:16.480 --> 38:18.480]  Thanks for the opportunity to talk about
[38:18.480 --> 38:20.680]  something close to my heart.
[38:20.680 --> 38:23.200]  Through my traumatic brain injury recovery,
[38:23.200 --> 38:26.880]  things changed frequently and without warning.
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.200]  When I first had the injury, CBD was what I needed.
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.200]  CBD got me through the recovery and back to my normal self.
[38:36.200 --> 38:39.680]  It made the swelling in my brain calm down.
[38:39.680 --> 38:42.000]  And if the swelling didn't go down organically,
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.480]  there was going to have to be a medical procedure done
[38:44.480 --> 38:45.880]  that would have changed my life,
[38:45.880 --> 38:47.000]  that would have fucked me up forever,
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.240]  that I would have been angry about.
[38:48.240 --> 38:50.480]  I would not be the same person right now
[38:50.480 --> 38:52.280]  had that had to happen to me.
[38:52.280 --> 38:53.760]  It would have pissed me off so much.
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.040]  I don't even wanna talk about it.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.320]  So it reduced the swelling.
[38:59.320 --> 39:01.160]  It reduced the inflammation in my brain.
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.440]  The CBD did that for me.
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.240]  Once that went away, also let me add
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.280]  that while I was doing the CBD,
[39:09.280 --> 39:11.040]  I was smoking CBD dabs.
[39:11.040 --> 39:12.440]  That's how it was working for me.
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.520]  Also, let me make a disclaimer just to cover my ass.
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.640]  I'm not a doctor.
[39:16.640 --> 39:19.040]  I have no medical training.
[39:19.040 --> 39:22.920]  This is what I have done myself and it worked.
[39:22.920 --> 39:25.640]  Please don't take me as a doctor.
[39:25.640 --> 39:27.240]  Consult a doctor.
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.680]  If your friend has a traumatic brain injury,
[39:29.680 --> 39:31.960]  go to all of the neurologist appointments
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.320]  that are required.
[39:33.320 --> 39:36.280]  Share with your doctor that you are using cannabis
[39:36.280 --> 39:38.800]  along with whatever medicines they give you.
[39:38.800 --> 39:40.240]  I am not a doctor.
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.000]  Please be responsible with your medical treatment,
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.280]  especially with a brain injury.
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.480]  There's not a lot that can be done,
[39:47.480 --> 39:48.720]  but go get checked out
[39:48.720 --> 39:50.760]  because you can have a stroke from shit.
[39:50.760 --> 39:52.160]  There's other things that can lead,
[39:52.160 --> 39:53.120]  that can come from this,
[39:53.120 --> 39:55.000]  and you need to be paid attention to
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.920]  by somebody that knows the long-term side effects
[39:57.920 --> 39:58.840]  of a brain injury.
[39:59.320 --> 40:00.160]  I wanna put that out there.
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.000]  I'm not a doctor.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.280]  That's probably fucking obvious,
[40:02.280 --> 40:03.600]  but I have to say that.
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.080]  Please be completely respectful
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.040]  to the medical professionals
[40:08.040 --> 40:09.960]  that are treating you for this brain injury
[40:09.960 --> 40:10.800]  if you're gonna do that.
[40:10.800 --> 40:11.800]  I just have to say that.
[40:11.800 --> 40:12.800]  I believe it,
[40:12.800 --> 40:15.240]  and also I have to say it to cover my ass.
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.600]  So what worked for me to start was CBD.
[40:17.600 --> 40:19.440]  I also added a product,
[40:19.440 --> 40:21.160]  and I don't work for this company.
[40:21.160 --> 40:22.200]  I'm not pitching them.
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.560]  I was taking a product called Alpha Brain from Onnit,
[40:25.560 --> 40:27.200]  which Joe Rogan pitches all the time.
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.520]  Joe Rogan eats Alpha Brain like they're candy.
[40:30.520 --> 40:33.400]  I was having problems recalling information.
[40:33.400 --> 40:36.000]  I was having word association problems.
[40:37.280 --> 40:39.440]  I was with my mom,
[40:39.440 --> 40:41.800]  and there was a banana on the counter,
[40:41.800 --> 40:43.320]  and I wanted the banana,
[40:43.320 --> 40:45.320]  but I kept calling it a burrito,
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.160]  and I said,
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.160]  mom, will you pass me that burrito?
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.400]  And she looked on the counter,
[40:49.400 --> 40:50.520]  and there was no burrito,
[40:50.520 --> 40:53.640]  so she told me there's no burrito there,
[40:53.640 --> 40:54.960]  and I was offended.
[40:54.960 --> 40:57.040]  I was like, I can fucking see the burrito.
[40:57.880 --> 40:58.720]  Why are you doing that?
[40:58.720 --> 40:59.560]  Give me that burrito,
[40:59.560 --> 41:00.520]  and I pointed to it,
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.080]  and then she looked at me a little bit concerned,
[41:02.080 --> 41:05.120]  and she said, Jeff, do you mean this banana?
[41:05.120 --> 41:06.920]  And I was like, fuck.
[41:06.920 --> 41:08.400]  I do mean banana,
[41:08.400 --> 41:11.120]  and I was seriously saying burrito like I meant it.
[41:11.120 --> 41:14.520]  Like I was mad at my mom for treating me like a fool,
[41:14.520 --> 41:17.200]  and that's when she realized you're broken.
[41:17.200 --> 41:18.280]  Like you're not kidding,
[41:18.280 --> 41:20.160]  because she thought I was exaggerating.
[41:20.160 --> 41:21.360]  I told her I hit my head,
[41:21.360 --> 41:22.880]  like knocked myself clean out.
[41:22.880 --> 41:24.200]  I don't remember shit,
[41:24.200 --> 41:25.040]  and she's like, whatever.
[41:25.040 --> 41:26.240]  Boys will be boys,
[41:26.240 --> 41:29.760]  and she didn't take it as seriously
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.120]  as she should have until that moment,
[41:31.120 --> 41:32.240]  and then she turned a little pale,
[41:32.240 --> 41:34.680]  and she realized like my kid's fucking broken.
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.000]  That's when people kind of started taking me
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.480]  a little more seriously about my broken shit,
[41:37.480 --> 41:39.640]  but I was having word association problems.
[41:39.640 --> 41:41.120]  I started taking AlphaBrain.
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.120]  They recommend two a day.
[41:43.120 --> 41:44.840]  I was taking four a day,
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.440]  because I'm like that, first of all.
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.760]  If you say take two, it'll fix you.
[41:49.760 --> 41:50.600]  I'll take fucking four.
[41:50.600 --> 41:52.000]  I'll be way better.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.360]  That's just the school I'm from.
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.520]  I have one rapid duct tape to fix it.
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.320]  The whole damn roll ought to fix it real good
[41:58.320 --> 41:59.640]  is the way I think.
[41:59.640 --> 42:01.760]  So I was taking four AlphaBrain,
[42:01.760 --> 42:04.280]  and honestly, I don't work for that company.
[42:04.280 --> 42:06.000]  This is serious testimony.
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.640]  I feel like it sped me up,
[42:07.640 --> 42:10.120]  because of the time without it and the time with it.
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.520]  When I started taking it,
[42:11.520 --> 42:12.760]  shit started coming back,
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.440]  like routines and patterns and my daily, what I do.
[42:17.440 --> 42:19.640]  Like I've got dreadlocks that hang to my butt,
[42:19.640 --> 42:21.200]  and I tie them in a knot on my head
[42:21.200 --> 42:23.960]  in a very particular way that I've been doing for,
[42:24.600 --> 42:25.560]  I've had these dreads for 13 years.
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.920]  I've been tying them like that since they could reach.
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.040]  I couldn't figure out how to do it after I hit my head.
[42:31.040 --> 42:32.160]  Imagine that.
[42:32.160 --> 42:33.840]  Imagine not knowing how to,
[42:33.840 --> 42:36.080]  whatever, basically something you do every day,
[42:36.080 --> 42:37.960]  probably tie your shoes.
[42:37.960 --> 42:39.280]  A lot of us just cut off our shoes,
[42:39.280 --> 42:41.040]  fucking lazy tied, all mine are lazy tied,
[42:41.040 --> 42:42.400]  so I can slip them on now.
[42:42.400 --> 42:43.880]  I'm trying to think of shit that you do every day.
[42:43.880 --> 42:44.720]  Brush your teeth.
[42:44.720 --> 42:46.560]  Imagine if you woke up tomorrow morning,
[42:46.560 --> 42:48.320]  and you just looked at your toothbrush and your toothpaste,
[42:48.320 --> 42:51.040]  and you're like, I kinda, I sorta have it.
[42:51.040 --> 42:51.960]  And you just stuck it in your mouth
[42:51.960 --> 42:53.280]  and poked your cheek a couple times.
[42:53.320 --> 42:55.280]  And you're like, nope, that's not what I do with this.
[42:55.280 --> 42:57.000]  You gotta think about it and figure it out.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.880]  I couldn't figure out how to tie up my own dreadlocks,
[42:59.880 --> 43:03.160]  and I've been doing it twice a day for the past 10 years,
[43:03.160 --> 43:05.160]  and I couldn't figure out how to fucking do it.
[43:05.160 --> 43:07.360]  The alpha brain made stuff like that
[43:07.360 --> 43:09.360]  start flowing back into my brain.
[43:09.360 --> 43:11.340]  Like, I missed an appointment.
[43:12.340 --> 43:14.120]  Bern from the grow store called me.
[43:14.120 --> 43:15.880]  She's like, hey, there's somebody here
[43:15.880 --> 43:18.780]  that says you promised you would meet them here.
[43:18.780 --> 43:19.620]  What's going on?
[43:19.620 --> 43:20.600]  I was like, dude, I hit my head.
[43:20.600 --> 43:23.240]  I don't even remember making an appointment.
[43:24.080 --> 43:25.600]  And then once I started taking the alpha brain,
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.260]  that phone call where I made that appointment
[43:27.260 --> 43:28.600]  and booked that, that came back.
[43:28.600 --> 43:30.180]  I was like, oh, I remember that.
[43:30.180 --> 43:32.860]  So CBD and alpha brain are what put me
[43:32.860 --> 43:35.260]  on the path to recovery.
[43:35.260 --> 43:37.860]  Eventually, the CBD stopped working,
[43:37.860 --> 43:40.520]  and it made me lethargic and lazy.
[43:40.520 --> 43:42.680]  And I know that sounds weird,
[43:42.680 --> 43:44.720]  but I'm an energetic, peppy guy.
[43:44.720 --> 43:46.820]  You can tell by how much I fucking talk.
[43:46.820 --> 43:48.000]  I'm not lazy.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.700]  I'm usually up first, and I'm up last also.
[43:50.700 --> 43:53.220]  I go to bed last, and I wake up first.
[43:54.060 --> 43:55.680]  And I smoke more dabs, and I crush.
[43:55.680 --> 43:57.480]  I do a lot of fucking work in a day.
[43:58.760 --> 44:01.280]  But the CBD was making me lazy.
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.520]  So I started shifting myself to high THC dabs,
[44:05.520 --> 44:07.680]  and then the distillates started coming around.
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.680]  This is when the 98 and 97 and 99% THC distillates
[44:13.320 --> 44:14.200]  started coming around.
[44:14.200 --> 44:16.720]  So I started dabbing that, and I found
[44:16.720 --> 44:21.480]  that super high doses of THC through a dab
[44:21.500 --> 44:24.580]  would make the noise in my head stop,
[44:24.580 --> 44:28.180]  and it would make the uncomfortable, out-of-focus feeling,
[44:28.180 --> 44:30.160]  it would make that go away.
[44:30.160 --> 44:32.900]  And I would be able to, and I know this sounds really weird,
[44:32.900 --> 44:35.600]  but I would be able to focus and function a little better
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.900]  when I smoked a super high THC dab.
[44:38.900 --> 44:41.460]  Now I can tell that my brain is getting much better
[44:41.460 --> 44:43.420]  and much more healthy.
[44:43.420 --> 44:45.960]  My thought patterns are much longer.
[44:45.960 --> 44:48.200]  They're like they used to be again.
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.340]  My paragraphs, when I write a podcast
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.280]  or when I write an email,
[44:51.280 --> 44:54.200]  my paragraphs are actually fucking paragraphs again.
[44:54.200 --> 44:55.960]  I have a beginning, a middle, and an end
[44:55.960 --> 44:57.160]  when I'm telling a story now.
[44:57.160 --> 44:58.660]  Back in the day, I would just ramble.
[44:58.660 --> 45:00.900]  But what I'm noticing is now that my brain
[45:00.900 --> 45:03.560]  is not injured so much, I'm getting really high
[45:03.560 --> 45:05.860]  when I smoke good THC hash.
[45:05.860 --> 45:08.700]  There are days when I can tell my brain is a little funky,
[45:08.700 --> 45:10.640]  and I think you guys can tell when I record also
[45:10.640 --> 45:11.880]  when I have a funky brain day,
[45:11.880 --> 45:13.340]  and people around me can tell,
[45:13.340 --> 45:14.900]  but the people that know me, they know,
[45:14.900 --> 45:16.520]  and they know that I'm staying away from them
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.080]  because I'm having a funky brain day.
[45:18.100 --> 45:19.540]  But on the funky brain days,
[45:20.540 --> 45:25.540]  if I dip high THC shatter into really limonene dominant terps
[45:29.100 --> 45:32.680]  my head troubles just chill the fuck out.
[45:32.680 --> 45:34.880]  And I'm really lucky that I figured that out.
[45:34.880 --> 45:37.420]  And it took talking to a few people with head injuries,
[45:37.420 --> 45:39.340]  and it took a lot of buying and smoking
[45:39.340 --> 45:41.020]  of a lot of shit to figure it out,
[45:41.020 --> 45:43.020]  but that's what works for me.
[45:43.020 --> 45:47.300]  So I don't know exactly what's gonna work for your friend.
[45:47.320 --> 45:49.760]  CBD should work in the beginning
[45:49.760 --> 45:51.800]  to help reduce the inflammation.
[45:51.800 --> 45:53.800]  And sometimes when you've got a brain injury
[45:53.800 --> 45:56.320]  or any kind of swelling on the body,
[45:56.320 --> 45:58.760]  too much THC will make your heart race.
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.340]  And that'll just make that bruised area, that injured area,
[46:02.340 --> 46:05.040]  it'll just make it throb and swell a little bit more,
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.140]  and it'll make it hurt and make it uncomfortable.
[46:07.140 --> 46:09.560]  And then that gets to your head,
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.760]  and then it makes it hurt more,
[46:10.760 --> 46:11.880]  and then it gets to your head again,
[46:11.880 --> 46:12.720]  and it makes it hurt more,
[46:12.720 --> 46:14.600]  and it's a fucked up hour and a half of being high
[46:14.600 --> 46:16.640]  and in unnecessary pain.
[46:16.640 --> 46:18.580]  So if you're gonna smoke CBD,
[46:18.580 --> 46:20.300]  if he is gonna smoke CBD,
[46:20.300 --> 46:22.540]  I would recommend go really, or THC.
[46:22.540 --> 46:25.040]  Let me restart that whole fucking statement.
[46:25.040 --> 46:26.900]  If your friend with a traumatic brain injury
[46:26.900 --> 46:28.820]  is going to choose to smoke THC,
[46:28.820 --> 46:32.220]  go light in the beginning because it may increase the pain.
[46:32.220 --> 46:35.180]  I highly recommend starting off with CBD.
[46:35.180 --> 46:38.040]  If he's been smoking, if he's already a cannabis user,
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.200]  if he's already a medical patient, a pothead, whatever,
[46:41.200 --> 46:44.820]  go heavy with the CBD treatments and he'll be just fine.
[46:44.820 --> 46:46.220]  See how that does.
[46:46.720 --> 46:48.360]  If it's working, do it.
[46:48.360 --> 46:49.840]  Go harder if you want to.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.440]  I don't know how he feels about edibles.
[46:52.440 --> 46:54.360]  The edibles are gonna come on a lot stronger.
[46:54.360 --> 46:55.960]  They're gonna last a lot longer.
[46:55.960 --> 46:58.560]  So smoke a little CBD, see how you like it.
[46:58.560 --> 47:00.720]  Then if it's working, start doing edibles.
[47:01.840 --> 47:03.800]  Like I'm saying, eventually maybe that CBD
[47:03.800 --> 47:06.640]  is gonna wear off as the brain injury progresses.
[47:06.640 --> 47:08.080]  This is what worked for me.
[47:08.080 --> 47:09.600]  Then shift to THC.
[47:09.600 --> 47:12.560]  When that THC isn't working, smoke CBD again.
[47:12.560 --> 47:13.720]  Just balance it out.
[47:13.720 --> 47:14.920]  You're gonna have to experiment.
[47:14.920 --> 47:17.380]  He's gonna be a guinea pig because
[47:17.380 --> 47:19.300]  his motherboard is broken.
[47:19.300 --> 47:20.740]  You know what I mean?
[47:20.740 --> 47:22.620]  So the computer doesn't work the way it should anymore.
[47:22.620 --> 47:24.620]  So maybe the things that should work for him
[47:24.620 --> 47:27.420]  aren't going to and the things that you would never think
[47:27.420 --> 47:29.680]  would work might because the computer's been
[47:29.680 --> 47:30.820]  a little bit reprogrammed.
[47:30.820 --> 47:32.780]  So be patient with him.
[47:32.780 --> 47:34.020]  As a friend, just be there for him.
[47:34.020 --> 47:35.580]  He's gonna say some weird shit.
[47:36.640 --> 47:38.780]  Just listen and just don't scare him.
[47:38.780 --> 47:40.940]  Don't point it out because it used to fuck with me
[47:40.940 --> 47:41.780]  when my friends would be like,
[47:41.780 --> 47:43.140]  dude, you're acting retarded.
[47:43.140 --> 47:44.960]  It would make me feel weird.
[47:44.960 --> 47:46.600]  So just treat him right.
[47:46.600 --> 47:48.300]  Make sure the dude's not suicidal.
[47:49.280 --> 47:50.760]  Because after a brain injury,
[47:50.760 --> 47:52.220]  suicidal thoughts creep into your head
[47:52.220 --> 47:55.240]  because you have, I try to find,
[47:55.240 --> 47:57.080]  is this the appropriate word of retarded?
[47:57.080 --> 47:59.200]  You feel retarded because you are retarded.
[47:59.200 --> 48:01.160]  Your thought process has been retarded.
[48:01.160 --> 48:04.360]  So you feel retarded and you lose confidence in yourself
[48:04.360 --> 48:06.000]  and your life isn't what it used to be
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  and it's hard to deal with.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.440]  So it puts the thought in the back of your head
[48:09.440 --> 48:11.800]  if I'm gonna feel like this every day and be retarded,
[48:11.800 --> 48:13.860]  I might just not have to do this anymore.
[48:13.860 --> 48:16.180]  So make sure your friend doesn't get in that space.
[48:16.180 --> 48:18.500]  I'm lucky that I've got great friends.
[48:18.500 --> 48:19.860]  My friends love me, my mom loves me,
[48:19.860 --> 48:20.980]  everybody kept a good eye on me.
[48:20.980 --> 48:23.380]  So that was not even a fucking option for me.
[48:23.380 --> 48:25.540]  But it does happen with a lot of people.
[48:25.540 --> 48:28.900]  We see it in football players, sports folks,
[48:28.900 --> 48:31.060]  athletes who get traumatic brain injuries,
[48:31.060 --> 48:32.680]  they kill themselves a lot.
[48:32.680 --> 48:34.580]  And it's because your brain is so fucked up,
[48:34.580 --> 48:35.420]  you can't think right.
[48:35.420 --> 48:37.880]  The motherboard is fucked up, the CD is skipping.
[48:37.880 --> 48:39.740]  You gotta find a way to stop the CD from skipping.
[48:39.760 --> 48:42.120]  And unfortunately, some suicide is a way to do it.
[48:42.120 --> 48:44.800]  So that's something you could really do
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.520]  is just be there for them.
[48:47.520 --> 48:49.800]  He said he was in a motorcycle accident.
[48:49.800 --> 48:52.640]  There's probably going to be some PTSD involved
[48:52.640 --> 48:54.740]  in an accident, involved in a motorcycle,
[48:54.740 --> 48:56.640]  involved in the sounds of a motorcycle,
[48:56.640 --> 48:58.680]  so be gentle with that.
[48:58.680 --> 49:02.340]  My traumatic brain injury was caused by a fucking doorway.
[49:03.200 --> 49:06.680]  I'm six and a half feet tall and this old part of town,
[49:06.700 --> 49:10.300]  it was built by old people from different descent.
[49:10.300 --> 49:13.620]  I only know the, we have a derogatory word for them
[49:13.620 --> 49:15.600]  that everybody just uses here like it's fucking normal.
[49:15.600 --> 49:17.780]  Even them, they made it up, I think.
[49:17.780 --> 49:20.620]  People of Slavic descent built small houses
[49:20.620 --> 49:21.660]  in this old part of town.
[49:21.660 --> 49:23.940]  So the doorways are low.
[49:23.940 --> 49:26.140]  And I tried to go through a Slovenian doorway
[49:26.140 --> 49:28.340]  and I'm a German boy and it didn't fucking fit.
[49:28.340 --> 49:29.900]  And kapow, I was knocked out.
[49:29.900 --> 49:33.300]  Now when I am at work in the grow and I'm standing up,
[49:33.300 --> 49:36.060]  if I kneel down to pick something up when I stand up,
[49:36.560 --> 49:37.920]  I stand up really slowly.
[49:37.920 --> 49:39.860]  And after about my fourth day there,
[49:39.860 --> 49:40.920]  one of my coworkers was like,
[49:40.920 --> 49:43.040]  bro, why do you stand up like that when you kneel down?
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.440]  And I was like, I have a traumatic brain injury
[49:44.440 --> 49:45.340]  and I'm afraid.
[49:45.340 --> 49:47.480]  And he's like, oh fuck yeah, that only takes one.
[49:47.480 --> 49:48.400]  And they all realized why.
[49:48.400 --> 49:49.520]  Now they watch me like,
[49:49.520 --> 49:51.160]  they notice that I'm keeping my head safe
[49:51.160 --> 49:54.880]  because after one, I don't want to do it again
[49:54.880 --> 49:57.280]  and I don't know if my brain could take it again.
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.760]  I might not survive that shit.
[49:59.760 --> 50:03.480]  Also, when I was younger, I've been trained in karate.
[50:03.480 --> 50:05.480]  I've got, doesn't matter.
[50:06.020 --> 50:07.620]  I've got some karate experience.
[50:07.620 --> 50:08.460]  I've done some tournaments.
[50:08.460 --> 50:11.540]  I was in a exhibition team.
[50:11.540 --> 50:13.100]  I've kicked people in the head, you guys,
[50:13.100 --> 50:16.140]  in tournaments, not in tournaments.
[50:16.140 --> 50:17.940]  God, I never want to do that again.
[50:17.940 --> 50:20.580]  And if I've ever kicked you in the head, I'm fucking sorry.
[50:20.580 --> 50:21.500]  That sucks.
[50:21.500 --> 50:23.140]  I can only imagine what I did to your brain.
[50:23.140 --> 50:24.260]  My eggs are scrambled
[50:24.260 --> 50:26.400]  and I hope I didn't do that to anybody in a fight,
[50:26.400 --> 50:29.420]  in a tournament, in the street, protecting myself, whatever.
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.420]  It's fucking horrible.
[50:30.420 --> 50:32.100]  You guys don't ever kick anybody in the head.
[50:32.100 --> 50:33.180]  If you have to get in a fight,
[50:33.180 --> 50:34.740]  fucking put them on the ground,
[50:34.760 --> 50:35.720]  make them tap out or something.
[50:35.720 --> 50:36.720]  Don't hit anybody in the head.
[50:36.720 --> 50:37.560]  That shit sucks.
[50:37.560 --> 50:39.400]  Cover your head, wear a helmet.
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.120]  All right, I am really rambly.
[50:41.120 --> 50:43.300]  I want to thank everybody that sent me emails.
[50:43.300 --> 50:45.440]  I want to thank Godfather Kush.
[50:45.440 --> 50:47.480]  I want to give a shout out to St. Skinny
[50:47.480 --> 50:49.840]  and Skinny Mom or St. Mom.
[50:49.840 --> 50:50.680]  Let's call you Skinny Mom.
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.160]  It's probably a fucking good compliment for anybody's mom.
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.880]  Skinny Mom, send some love and energy to that whole family
[50:56.880 --> 50:58.040]  if they need some support.
[50:58.040 --> 51:00.320]  Also, it sounds like our friend M&M's buddy
[51:00.320 --> 51:01.760]  could use a little bit of support.
[51:01.760 --> 51:03.920]  So send some love and light that direction.
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.520]  Yeah, protect your head, you guys.
[51:07.520 --> 51:09.600]  Fuck, reading this about the traumatic brain injury
[51:09.600 --> 51:12.040]  really got me riled up and got me ranting.
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.960]  But you say you want to grow some cannabis for him.
[51:15.960 --> 51:18.240]  If you need something with high CBD,
[51:18.240 --> 51:21.760]  I could probably recommend Tora Bora from DNA Genetics,
[51:21.760 --> 51:24.640]  Pennywise from TGA Subcool Seeds.
[51:24.640 --> 51:25.720]  And there are probably tons
[51:25.720 --> 51:28.640]  of other high CBD strains out there.
[51:28.640 --> 51:30.640]  You may be able to reach out to somebody
[51:31.560 --> 51:33.760]  on the Facebook community and the Instagram community,
[51:33.780 --> 51:36.660]  and you may be able to find free seeds
[51:36.660 --> 51:38.940]  that are high in CBD if that's your goal.
[51:38.940 --> 51:39.900]  It may be possible.
[51:39.900 --> 51:41.200]  Reach out to me if you can't do it.
[51:41.200 --> 51:42.620]  Maybe I'll help you out.
[51:42.620 --> 51:43.820]  We'll do what we can.
[51:43.820 --> 51:46.020]  Also, you said what strains are beneficial
[51:46.020 --> 51:48.640]  and what method of ingestion is best?
[51:48.640 --> 51:49.780]  I would start with smoking.
[51:49.780 --> 51:52.500]  If your friend has been a smoker before,
[51:52.500 --> 51:54.780]  roll him a joint, load him a bowl.
[51:54.780 --> 51:57.460]  If they are, if he's been a heavy smoker before,
[51:57.460 --> 51:58.920]  I keep saying he, it could be a she.
[51:58.920 --> 52:00.900]  Let's see, a friend of mine was in an accident
[52:00.900 --> 52:02.700]  and had, he said he.
[52:02.700 --> 52:03.800]  All right, I just wanna make sure.
[52:03.800 --> 52:05.080]  I don't wanna be sexist on accident.
[52:05.080 --> 52:06.640]  I'm trying to be more sensitive.
[52:07.480 --> 52:10.000]  If they've been, if he's a smoker before, give him a dab.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.800]  Because I think a dab is good
[52:11.800 --> 52:14.360]  because you see immediate results.
[52:14.360 --> 52:16.460]  Like there's so much, it's concentrated.
[52:16.460 --> 52:17.480]  So when you take a dab of it,
[52:17.480 --> 52:19.840]  you're gonna get the results immediately.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.940]  You'll know if it works, you'll know if it doesn't.
[52:21.940 --> 52:24.060]  And then you can go from there quickly.
[52:24.060 --> 52:26.200]  With flowers, it's gonna take a few more inhales
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.600]  depending on the person's tolerance.
[52:28.600 --> 52:30.240]  But I would start with flowers.
[52:30.240 --> 52:31.460]  Find out how those work.
[52:31.460 --> 52:33.440]  Find out what you need.
[52:33.440 --> 52:36.560]  Excuse me, then switch to concentrates or edibles
[52:36.560 --> 52:39.140]  just to be able to deliver the medicine more properly.
[52:39.140 --> 52:42.360]  They do make a patch if you're in a medicinal state.
[52:42.360 --> 52:44.780]  It's not, you said treated at a Craig hospital,
[52:44.780 --> 52:46.800]  possibly Craig, Colorado.
[52:46.800 --> 52:47.760]  The patches are great.
[52:47.760 --> 52:50.440]  The transdermal patches, the CBD patches.
[52:50.440 --> 52:52.920]  You can put those wherever it hurts.
[52:52.920 --> 52:54.280]  So that is very useful.
[52:54.280 --> 52:55.960]  I don't know if you can put them on your head
[52:55.960 --> 52:58.400]  if you've got hair, but maybe on your lower neck,
[52:58.400 --> 53:00.760]  something like that would work for you.
[53:00.780 --> 53:02.980]  But you gotta start out with smoking.
[53:02.980 --> 53:04.460]  Smoking works right away.
[53:04.460 --> 53:06.820]  And also it's the easiest to shake off.
[53:06.820 --> 53:08.660]  If you eat edibles, it's gonna last a long time.
[53:08.660 --> 53:11.020]  If you take a dab, it's gonna last a while.
[53:11.020 --> 53:12.740]  If you take one or two puffs off a pipe
[53:12.740 --> 53:13.980]  and it goes the wrong way,
[53:13.980 --> 53:16.140]  it's not gonna take a long time to get that out of you.
[53:16.140 --> 53:17.660]  Couple of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
[53:17.660 --> 53:19.080]  maybe something to drink,
[53:19.080 --> 53:20.580]  you should be just fine pretty soon.
[53:20.580 --> 53:22.900]  Wouldn't be too uncomfortable for most people.
[53:22.900 --> 53:25.900]  All right, Eminem, I hope I was able to help you out.
[53:25.900 --> 53:28.900]  I hope you're able to get started growing for your friend.
[53:28.920 --> 53:31.280]  Like I said, if you need help finding CBD seeds,
[53:31.280 --> 53:32.120]  let me know.
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.280]  I know a few people that may be able to donate
[53:34.280 --> 53:37.040]  a 10 pack of seeds to you just to get you started.
[53:37.040 --> 53:40.200]  Sounds like your friend needs some help.
[53:40.200 --> 53:42.120]  Hey, I wanna give you a shout out
[53:42.120 --> 53:44.320]  for reaching out to me to help your friend.
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.880]  That's some good friend shit.
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.520]  That's what we need, more friends like that.
[53:47.520 --> 53:49.040]  I hope everything goes well with your friend.
[53:49.040 --> 53:51.840]  I hope he recovers well from the traumatic brain injury.
[53:51.840 --> 53:55.800]  If you want more interaction about this TBI,
[53:55.800 --> 53:57.400]  if you'd like to talk to me more about it
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.640]  just because I've been there,
[53:59.380 --> 54:00.620]  like I said, I'm not a doctor, but I've done it.
[54:00.620 --> 54:03.460]  So if you or your friend, excuse me,
[54:03.460 --> 54:04.780]  if you or your friend would like to reach out
[54:04.780 --> 54:06.740]  and talk to me about it, I'm here.
[54:06.740 --> 54:08.140]  I like sharing my story.
[54:08.140 --> 54:10.440]  I'm passionate about it, so don't be shy.
[54:10.440 --> 54:13.220]  So shout out to everybody who sent me an email.
