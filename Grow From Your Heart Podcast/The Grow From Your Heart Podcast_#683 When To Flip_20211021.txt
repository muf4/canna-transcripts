[00:00.000 --> 00:11.160]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:11.160 --> 00:17.600]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 683 of the Grow From Your
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.600]  Heart podcast.
[00:18.600 --> 00:21.160]  I've got a great show lined up for you.
[00:21.160 --> 00:24.920]  Before we get to the main topic of today's podcast, let's do a few shout outs to a few
[00:24.920 --> 00:29.240]  of the great folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:29.240 --> 00:33.120]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to a longtime
[00:33.120 --> 00:35.440]  supporter my buddy Zaxxon Starker.
[00:35.440 --> 00:38.880]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a good friend my buddy Jesse Grose.
[00:38.880 --> 00:41.760]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to ADHD Grower.
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.200]  I want to send a side kick and a thank you shout out to Choke Norris.
[00:45.200 --> 00:48.320]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy Dan.
[00:48.320 --> 00:51.520]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to the Larf Night Rises.
[00:51.520 --> 00:54.880]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[00:54.880 --> 00:58.600]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[00:58.600 --> 01:00.800]  to my buddy Lemur Priest.
[01:00.800 --> 01:05.520]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.160]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.280]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:15.280 --> 01:19.000]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.700]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:25.700 --> 01:29.860]  This of course is the part of the podcast where I invite you to join the discord server.
[01:29.860 --> 01:34.980]  There's an iRegenetics Grow From Your Heart podcast discord server and you are invited.
[01:34.980 --> 01:39.460]  There's a link in the show notes and in the video description and I hope to see you there.
[01:39.460 --> 01:42.460]  All right, let's not waste too much time with the long intro.
[01:42.460 --> 01:46.940]  I do want to make an update before I get too far on a previous episode.
[01:46.940 --> 01:49.260]  In a previous episode I was talking about saving money.
[01:49.260 --> 01:54.280]  I gave a bunch of tips and advice on saving money in your grow room but I forgot one major
[01:54.280 --> 01:56.560]  component that may help you save some money.
[01:56.560 --> 01:59.020]  Let's think about kilowatt hours.
[01:59.020 --> 02:01.680]  Electricity is cheaper at off peak hours in most areas.
[02:01.680 --> 02:03.480]  I live in a semi large city.
[02:03.480 --> 02:06.880]  I know that after peak hours electricity gets cheaper.
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.080]  So why not run your grow lights at night when the sun goes down, when all the business is
[02:12.080 --> 02:15.240]  closed, when most of the people go to bed, your grow lights come on.
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.680]  That way the light is a little bit cheaper to run.
[02:17.680 --> 02:21.040]  It doesn't sound like a big cost cutter but the more lights you're running, the more hours
[02:21.040 --> 02:24.040]  you've got them on, the more money you will save.
[02:24.800 --> 02:26.960]  It goes along with running the lights in the dark time.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.600]  So you've got the dark time is now the daytime.
[02:29.600 --> 02:31.320]  So you've got your normal daytime.
[02:31.320 --> 02:34.000]  It's dark in your grow space when the sun goes down.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.760]  Your lights come on in the grow space.
[02:35.760 --> 02:38.880]  Now you don't need as much air conditioning because it's not as hot outside.
[02:38.880 --> 02:41.440]  So you're helping yourself out in a couple of ways.
[02:41.440 --> 02:43.040]  You don't need as many fans.
[02:43.040 --> 02:44.380]  You don't need as much air conditioning.
[02:44.380 --> 02:47.220]  You don't have as much dehumidification to be done.
[02:47.220 --> 02:50.480]  Not as much competition with other equipment and natural elements.
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.000]  So I completely missed it when I said, let's run the lights at night.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.160]  I forgot that part.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.160]  All right.
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.160]  I feel like I'm caught up now.
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.480]  I feel like that was really important since the kilowatts are cheaper, run them at night.
[03:02.480 --> 03:03.480]  Why not?
[03:03.480 --> 03:05.840]  Then another thing that I should mention, it is becoming winter time.
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.480]  A lot of people are going to choose to pull in cold air from outside to cool off their
[03:10.480 --> 03:11.480]  grow space.
[03:11.480 --> 03:13.880]  That's a good idea, but don't bring in too cold of air.
[03:13.880 --> 03:16.120]  You don't want to introduce icicles into your grow space.
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.840]  That's a great way to cause problems and encourage powdery mildew.
[03:19.880 --> 03:23.400]  So those were two things that I thought I should include in the last episode.
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.080]  Got excited, got carried away, left some shit out, wanted to make sure to get that into
[03:28.080 --> 03:29.080]  this episode.
[03:29.080 --> 03:30.080]  All right.
[03:30.080 --> 03:32.400]  Let me give you an update on what has been going on in my world.
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.240]  It feels comfortable to start the show by talking about what's going on.
[03:35.240 --> 03:38.520]  Then we'll work our way casually into the grow lessons.
[03:38.520 --> 03:40.600]  I have been pulling seeds from the buzz.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.600]  That's right.
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.920]  If you've been following along, you know that I did have an outdoor harvest that in my opinion
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.920]  was very successful.
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.420]  I gave a huge shout out to the crew that helped me out.
[03:48.420 --> 03:49.760]  So thank you guys once again.
[03:50.680 --> 03:53.560]  Can't forget the lovely females that help us out.
[03:53.560 --> 03:54.560]  But thank you for that.
[03:54.560 --> 03:56.520]  I've been pulling the seeds from those buds.
[03:56.520 --> 03:58.880]  It took a few days to get the buds nice and dry.
[03:58.880 --> 04:02.680]  Then of course I needed to find a moment to dedicate time to getting those seeds out of
[04:02.680 --> 04:03.680]  the buds.
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.020]  I get them super dry in a container.
[04:06.020 --> 04:07.020]  Then I just crunch them up.
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.320]  I put on rubber gloves and crunch the buds up basically into a dust.
[04:10.320 --> 04:13.720]  Then I run the seeds through the grow easy seed sorting machine.
[04:13.720 --> 04:16.000]  It's the easy seed or grow easy, something like that.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.900]  They don't pay me to advertise for them.
[04:17.900 --> 04:22.220]  But I've got a seed separating machine that does save me quite a bit of time.
[04:22.220 --> 04:23.220]  Run the seeds through there.
[04:23.220 --> 04:26.000]  Then immediately after that, they go through a seed counter.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.700]  So I spent most of the afternoon pulling seeds and running them through the seed counter.
[04:30.700 --> 04:33.720]  The numbers were in my opinion, quite impressive.
[04:33.720 --> 04:37.140]  My friends that grew outdoors said that next year it will be double because the plants
[04:37.140 --> 04:40.120]  will be larger, will be more prepared, do more tricks and tips.
[04:40.120 --> 04:41.300]  This year was a test run.
[04:41.300 --> 04:43.980]  I was more than satisfied, really excited.
[04:43.980 --> 04:45.760]  There is some new stuff in those seeds.
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.200]  There is some old stuff in those seeds.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.840]  Many people have been asking if those were the feminized seeds.
[04:50.840 --> 04:52.200]  No, they are not feminized.
[04:52.200 --> 04:55.040]  They did not do feminized seeds outdoors.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.600]  Fem seeds are a little bit more work.
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.640]  This was my first run in a greenhouse environment breeding outdoors.
[05:00.640 --> 05:03.120]  I didn't want to do fem seeds outdoors.
[05:03.120 --> 05:05.040]  That is two obstacles.
[05:05.040 --> 05:11.920]  I wanted to do regular male, female seeds with a male plant and a female plant outside.
[05:11.920 --> 05:12.920]  What's the word?
[05:12.920 --> 05:13.960]  Variables is what I'm looking for.
[05:13.960 --> 05:15.640]  It was more likely for success.
[05:15.720 --> 05:18.000]  I wanted to learn outdoors with reg seeds.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.560]  We'll keep the fem seeds indoors.
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.560]  That works.
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.480]  People were asking if these were the orange chasms and the lemon Jefferies and the golden
[05:24.480 --> 05:25.480]  goats.
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.560]  No, unfortunately for you, they were not.
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.360]  There was, I guess it is time to announce a couple more of the things that were in there.
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.200]  Of course, I made more strawberry starburst.
[05:35.200 --> 05:36.800]  I made more of the sun kiss.
[05:36.800 --> 05:38.560]  I made more blue raspberry truffle.
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.320]  A lot of people are looking for the BRT.
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.560]  It has been sold out.
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.600]  It is being restocked to most of the vendors as we speak.
[05:46.560 --> 05:47.760]  I made more lady marmalade.
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.640]  A lot of those also are being sent to the vendors as we speak.
[05:50.640 --> 05:53.400]  If you've been looking for them, check the vendor list on the website.
[05:53.400 --> 05:55.280]  They may have them by now.
[05:55.280 --> 06:01.560]  Also, in this run, I made two new things that have been named Saka Souffle and the Machine.
[06:01.560 --> 06:02.560]  They've already been made.
[06:02.560 --> 06:05.600]  I made a bunch more so that we can release them and put these out to the market.
[06:05.600 --> 06:08.600]  Saka Souffle and the Machine are officially made.
[06:08.600 --> 06:10.880]  People have been asking a lot of questions about them.
[06:10.880 --> 06:16.160]  I will do full complete podcast episodes on Saka Souffle and the Machine closer to
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.160]  the release time.
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.800]  We are working on getting that released.
[06:18.800 --> 06:21.520]  I am working on getting those seeds released.
[06:21.520 --> 06:23.400]  I made artwork for the packaging.
[06:23.400 --> 06:25.280]  The packaging is being...
[06:25.280 --> 06:26.560]  I threw together an idea.
[06:26.560 --> 06:29.120]  I've got a real artist that can do real work for the packaging.
[06:29.120 --> 06:32.120]  They're putting real art together for packaging designs for me.
[06:32.120 --> 06:35.400]  I've got to package the seeds.
[06:35.400 --> 06:36.440]  That's basically what's happening.
[06:36.440 --> 06:39.000]  The art is in the works and the packaging is happening.
[06:39.120 --> 06:44.720]  We will plan and release an official drop date for Saka Souffle and the Machine.
[06:44.720 --> 06:46.680]  I will tell you all about what those names mean.
[06:46.680 --> 06:53.040]  A lot of my friends already know what Saka Souffle and what the Machine means.
[06:53.040 --> 06:54.520]  If you've been asking, is it this?
[06:54.520 --> 06:55.840]  Yes, you're probably correct.
[06:55.840 --> 07:00.480]  It is everything you're assuming that those strains are named after, especially when you
[07:00.480 --> 07:01.660]  hear them together.
[07:01.660 --> 07:03.000]  It should make it a little bit more obvious.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.640]  If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, we will reveal it.
[07:05.680 --> 07:09.400]  I'll tell you everything about Saka Souffle and the Machine in the future.
[07:09.400 --> 07:12.200]  Again, those are being planned for an official drop.
[07:12.200 --> 07:16.280]  There was more stuff in that run also that does need to be tested.
[07:16.280 --> 07:17.960]  I made some brand new stuff.
[07:17.960 --> 07:21.640]  I've got some new crosses in there that I've never bred to.
[07:21.640 --> 07:22.640]  Let's just tease one of them.
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.400]  I pollinated the P91 clone with an Arise male.
[07:27.400 --> 07:30.720]  Arise was the male in the greenhouse, just in case you haven't caught on, if you aren't
[07:30.720 --> 07:32.280]  familiar with my crosses.
[07:32.920 --> 07:36.000]  King Solomon, Arise male, was the male in the greenhouse.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.920]  He pollinated the P91 clone.
[07:38.920 --> 07:40.720]  I think I've got a good name for that cross.
[07:40.720 --> 07:42.920]  It's being sent out as testers.
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.080]  People are getting a lot of stuff as testers.
[07:46.080 --> 07:47.720]  I hit the P91 with the Arise.
[07:47.720 --> 07:48.720]  That's one of the new things.
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.800]  I'll reveal more stuff as time goes on.
[07:50.800 --> 07:54.040]  Since I did mention testers, a lot of people are going to ask how to be a tester.
[07:54.040 --> 07:57.480]  There's a full podcast episode about being a tester.
[07:57.480 --> 07:58.680]  Please listen to that episode.
[07:58.680 --> 08:00.960]  Then reach out if you would like to test for me.
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.600]  I want to say this.
[08:02.600 --> 08:06.560]  I've mentioned several strains on this podcast that I made.
[08:06.560 --> 08:09.400]  I have not revealed everything that was made in that greenhouse.
[08:09.400 --> 08:13.340]  If you're getting testers, don't think that just because I've mentioned something on the
[08:13.340 --> 08:14.760]  show that that's what you've got.
[08:14.760 --> 08:17.640]  You could have tester seeds from the run before.
[08:17.640 --> 08:19.320]  They could be testers from the greenhouse.
[08:19.320 --> 08:22.520]  They could be testers from an indoor run.
[08:22.520 --> 08:24.080]  It could be anything that you're testing.
[08:24.080 --> 08:26.080]  I try to keep the testing a little bit secret.
[08:26.080 --> 08:29.240]  I know what you've got, but you probably don't.
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.760]  Don't think that just because I'm talking about P91 to Arise that you've got the testers.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.760]  Maybe you do.
[08:34.760 --> 08:35.760]  Maybe you don't.
[08:35.760 --> 08:37.720]  There are about six things out there being tested right now.
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.320]  A lot of people are going to start seeing the testing pop up on the Discord.
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.320]  That's right.
[08:43.320 --> 08:44.720]  Advertise the Discord one more time.
[08:44.720 --> 08:48.660]  On the Discord server, there is a seed tester tab.
[08:48.660 --> 08:51.680]  It says iRegenetics tester or Rostegev's testers.
[08:51.680 --> 08:52.680]  It's real easy.
[08:52.680 --> 08:53.680]  It's real obvious.
[08:53.680 --> 08:54.680]  It's real easy to find.
[08:54.680 --> 08:59.320]  I'm asking all of my testers to post their test pictures, their stories, their grow reports
[08:59.320 --> 09:01.000]  right there on the Discord.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.460]  It makes it easy for me to find, and it makes it transparent for the consumers.
[09:05.460 --> 09:09.360]  If you're thinking about buying a strain, you can see it from the testing, from all
[09:09.360 --> 09:10.980]  the other people that are growing it.
[09:10.980 --> 09:14.440]  You can see what it's going to be like in their environment, their experience.
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.440]  If you're interested, check it out on the Discord under the iRegenetics tester section.
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.760]  If you haven't jumped on the Discord now and you're a tester, please do jump on the Discord
[09:22.760 --> 09:24.120]  and join the tester tab.
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.720]  I would appreciate seeing your posts there.
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.640]  It's brand new, so I'm patient, but let's get that going.
[09:28.640 --> 09:30.720]  Anyway, let me get myself back on track.
[09:30.720 --> 09:32.680]  Saka Souffle and The Machine are coming up.
[09:32.680 --> 09:36.040]  P91 to Arise, I think it's got a good name.
[09:36.040 --> 09:39.380]  That's one of the fun parts about making new crosses is naming all the stuff.
[09:39.380 --> 09:40.600]  It's a good time.
[09:40.600 --> 09:42.160]  I think that's all I've got for that part.
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.520]  I did mention the Femme seeds.
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.320]  People have been asking for Orangegasm, Lemon Jeffery, and Golden Goat Femini seeds.
[09:49.320 --> 09:52.720]  Also people that are in the know that have been paying attention, people that are in
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.760]  the loop have been asking for the Red Pill and the Blue Pill, which may get renamed.
[09:56.760 --> 09:57.760]  I've been tossing around.
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.760]  I've got new names for them in my mind, but they may just stay Red Pill and Blue Pill
[10:00.760 --> 10:03.240]  because it kind of stuck right at this point.
[10:03.240 --> 10:04.240]  Why fucking change it?
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.040]  But they may have hashtags or subnames or taglines or something with them.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.460]  Anyway, I'm rambling again.
[10:09.460 --> 10:13.360]  It seems to be the theme of the show, but if you've been asking for those Femini seeds,
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.200]  you will be happy to know that the clones are cut and the plants are growing.
[10:17.200 --> 10:19.400]  They're not very big yet, but be patient.
[10:19.400 --> 10:20.400]  Give me some time.
[10:20.400 --> 10:21.440]  Those clones have been cut.
[10:21.440 --> 10:22.440]  They are happening.
[10:22.440 --> 10:24.160]  They are coming up.
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.600]  Give me, I want to say 150 days.
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.760]  I keep saying 120 to 150 days because that's a good time frame that gives me time to get
[10:30.760 --> 10:33.720]  all the stuff that needs to happen done.
[10:33.720 --> 10:35.240]  Also good things come to those who wait.
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.680]  There's no way to rush these plants.
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.440]  They're going to grow at the rate they're going to grow.
[10:38.440 --> 10:40.240]  I'm going to pollinate them when it's time.
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  They'll get harvested.
[10:41.240 --> 10:42.240]  They'll get to you.
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.400]  All I can say is be patient.
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.800]  You've been being quite patient for quite a while, so just keep waiting.
[10:48.800 --> 10:49.800]  They're coming.
[10:49.800 --> 10:50.800]  I promise.
[10:51.160 --> 10:53.680]  This does segue me into my next note.
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.840]  A few days ago while I was working in my grow space, I discovered an ugly furry spider.
[10:58.840 --> 10:59.840]  He's scary.
[10:59.840 --> 11:00.840]  He's what nightmares are made of.
[11:00.840 --> 11:01.840]  It could be a he.
[11:01.840 --> 11:02.840]  It could be a she.
[11:02.840 --> 11:04.760]  I guess I just gender assumed it's gender.
[11:04.760 --> 11:07.040]  I apologize to the spider.
[11:07.040 --> 11:08.720]  It might not even be a spider for all I know.
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.020]  I'm not a scientist or a Scientologist or an arachnidist, but anyway, there is a creature
[11:14.020 --> 11:20.040]  in my grow that does look a lot like a spider and it's ugly and it's creepy and it's furry.
[11:20.280 --> 11:23.600]  In California, when I was a little kid, we called them Mexican jumping spiders because
[11:23.600 --> 11:26.120]  they would ball up into a little ball and then jump at you when you looked at them.
[11:26.120 --> 11:28.160]  They'd freak my shit out.
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.040]  I don't know if that's ... Did I just culturally appropriate that spider?
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.040]  The future is weird.
[11:33.040 --> 11:36.200]  Anyway, there's a Mexican jumping spider that I have decided it's a dude.
[11:36.200 --> 11:37.440]  I've named it as a boy.
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.360]  I call it bro and I call it dude when I talk to it, so blame me if you want.
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.720]  Anyway, I've developed a relationship with this spider and I can't bring myself to kill
[11:45.720 --> 11:46.720]  it.
[11:46.720 --> 11:49.280]  As long as he doesn't fuck with me, I won't fuck with him.
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.400]  It stays a few feet from me.
[11:51.400 --> 11:55.360]  Wherever I move in the grow, I keep an eye on it and I'm like, where are you motherfucker?
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.240]  Every time I move around, so does he.
[11:57.240 --> 11:58.600]  He seems to know where I am.
[11:58.600 --> 12:00.020]  He stays away from me.
[12:00.020 --> 12:04.280]  He doesn't want anything to do with me just like I don't want anything to do with him,
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.000]  but I don't want to kill it because I haven't seen a fungus gnat in there since that spider
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  popped up.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.520]  I think he's working security.
[12:10.520 --> 12:12.120]  I think he's doing me some favors.
[12:12.120 --> 12:13.560]  I think he's earning his space.
[12:13.560 --> 12:16.520]  He's paying rent, so I am not killing him.
[12:16.520 --> 12:20.360]  My question to you is, how do you feel about a spider in your grow?
[12:20.360 --> 12:22.360]  It's not a polite looking spider.
[12:22.360 --> 12:25.280]  He's not a cuddly fucking friendly looking spider.
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.440]  Like I said earlier, he is what nightmares are fucking made of.
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.760]  It's an ugly spider and sorry spider if you hear this, you're fucking ugly bro.
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.920]  You probably think I'm ugly too, but how do you guys feel about a spider in your grow?
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.880]  Do you leave a spider in the grow space?
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.280]  I don't know if this spider is harmful to humans.
[12:41.280 --> 12:42.280]  I really don't.
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.540]  I didn't do any research on that.
[12:43.540 --> 12:47.380]  The way that he stayed away from me, I feel like that spider wants nothing to do with
[12:47.380 --> 12:48.700]  me and it knows where I am.
[12:48.700 --> 12:51.100]  When I move a plant over here, it goes that way.
[12:51.100 --> 12:52.300]  It's like, nope.
[12:52.300 --> 12:54.740]  He's always up near the top of the canopy so I can find him.
[12:54.740 --> 12:58.380]  He likes the light and I think he's just waiting for the fungus gnats to go up to the light
[12:58.380 --> 13:00.180]  and then come down and then he eats them.
[13:00.180 --> 13:01.660]  I think he's got a good strategy.
[13:01.660 --> 13:04.860]  There haven't been any other bugs in there.
[13:04.860 --> 13:06.260]  I usually spray for pests.
[13:06.260 --> 13:07.900]  I spray pesticides once a week.
[13:07.900 --> 13:10.500]  I haven't sprayed because I've seen him in there and I don't want to kill him.
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.740]  I feel like that's his little playground.
[13:12.740 --> 13:15.700]  I don't know how long he's going to live, how long that spider breed lasts.
[13:15.700 --> 13:16.700]  I don't know.
[13:16.700 --> 13:19.140]  What if it has a bunch of babies and I have a bunch of fucking spiders in there?
[13:19.140 --> 13:21.940]  What if it's a mama spider and I'm calling it bro this whole time?
[13:21.940 --> 13:25.620]  Anyway, I've got a spider in the grow and it seems to be working security because there
[13:25.620 --> 13:27.180]  are no other bugs.
[13:27.180 --> 13:29.980]  This particular type of spider doesn't make a lot of webs.
[13:29.980 --> 13:31.060]  He's not a webby spider.
[13:31.060 --> 13:33.340]  I haven't seen any webs or any messes in there.
[13:33.340 --> 13:35.460]  So I'm just curious, how do you react?
[13:35.460 --> 13:37.980]  How do you respond to a spider in your grow?
[13:37.980 --> 13:39.580]  A lot of people like a praying mantis.
[13:39.580 --> 13:43.020]  A lot of people like ladybugs, which in my opinion, ladybugs are lazy.
[13:43.020 --> 13:46.820]  If you're going to release ladybugs in your grow, release a more aggressive predator,
[13:46.820 --> 13:50.420]  something that's going to be worth its money, worth its time.
[13:50.420 --> 13:51.860]  Ladybugs die.
[13:51.860 --> 13:53.620]  Ladybugs die very quickly in the grow space.
[13:53.620 --> 13:57.220]  A lot of them end up in your fan and your duct work and you got to sweep them up or
[13:57.220 --> 14:00.860]  you step on them and then they make that crunchy poppy noise and you feel like shit about it.
[14:00.860 --> 14:03.020]  And they also stink so bad.
[14:03.020 --> 14:05.060]  Also they are a vector for diseases.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.180]  They bring their own problems with them.
[14:07.180 --> 14:11.100]  A lot of them are harvested here in the Rocky Mountain regions and they're sent all over
[14:11.100 --> 14:12.100]  the world.
[14:12.100 --> 14:16.780]  So you're taking a Rocky Mountain ladybug species and putting it all over the country,
[14:16.780 --> 14:19.940]  I guess, maybe not the world, but all over the country and it doesn't want to be there.
[14:19.940 --> 14:20.940]  So it's not going to thrive.
[14:20.940 --> 14:21.940]  It's going to die.
[14:21.940 --> 14:25.260]  Get a more aggressive, more appropriate predator is what I'm trying to say.
[14:25.260 --> 14:27.660]  But how do you feel about the spider?
[14:27.660 --> 14:29.100]  I've been rambling long enough about him.
[14:29.100 --> 14:30.100]  I want to know what you think.
[14:30.100 --> 14:31.980]  Do you kill that spider or do you not?
[14:31.980 --> 14:34.060]  I know all the hippie girls are going, don't kill the spider.
[14:34.060 --> 14:35.060]  It's peaceful in there.
[14:35.060 --> 14:36.060]  But I want to know.
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.060]  That's a production area.
[14:37.060 --> 14:38.060]  We want it clean.
[14:38.060 --> 14:39.180]  We want it safe.
[14:39.180 --> 14:40.460]  But also he's paying rent.
[14:40.460 --> 14:42.340]  I think he's eating more bugs.
[14:42.340 --> 14:43.340]  All right.
[14:43.340 --> 14:44.340]  That is a lot of rambling.
[14:44.340 --> 14:45.340]  How long have I been going?
[14:45.340 --> 14:50.260]  Long enough to work my way into the question that I want to present you today.
[14:50.260 --> 14:53.700]  I've been talking a lot about when is the first day of flip.
[14:53.700 --> 14:57.020]  I always, and I'm going to say it again just because I want to put it out there one more
[14:57.020 --> 14:58.020]  time.
[14:58.020 --> 15:01.420]  Day one of flower is when you change the timer to 1212.
[15:01.420 --> 15:02.420]  That is day one.
[15:02.420 --> 15:04.100]  You decide when day one is.
[15:04.100 --> 15:05.700]  You turn the timer to 1212.
[15:06.420 --> 15:09.700]  Let me regroup and re-say this again.
[15:09.700 --> 15:14.740]  In an indoor grow environment, day one of flowering is when you turn the timer to 12
[15:14.740 --> 15:17.860]  hours on and 12 hours off or something similar.
[15:17.860 --> 15:20.400]  It could be 1113 or something like that.
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.380]  But day one is when you change that timer, not any other time.
[15:25.380 --> 15:27.200]  Some people want to wait till they see pistols.
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.780]  Some people want to do that and then count 10 days after that.
[15:30.780 --> 15:32.380]  It's not a fucking math equation.
[15:32.380 --> 15:35.340]  Day one is the day we change the timer.
[15:35.980 --> 15:37.060]  Why do a math equation?
[15:37.060 --> 15:38.620]  There's no algebra involved here.
[15:38.620 --> 15:39.940]  This is day one.
[15:39.940 --> 15:44.620]  So that being said, the next question is when do I flip?
[15:44.620 --> 15:45.620]  When?
[15:45.620 --> 15:46.620]  When do I flip?
[15:46.620 --> 15:48.420]  How do I know when it is time to flip my plants?
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.420]  How do I know?
[15:49.420 --> 15:51.220]  That's a really, really good question.
[15:51.220 --> 15:55.540]  A lot of knowing when to flip your plants is understanding your goal.
[15:55.540 --> 15:59.020]  Another big part about knowing when to flip your plants is understanding how much your
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.680]  plants are going to stretch.
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.680]  Understanding the stretch of the flowering phase.
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.260]  Let's talk about that for just a little bit.
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.940]  What do I mean by the stretching phase?
[16:07.940 --> 16:12.740]  When we change that timer to 12-12, we have now told the plant it is flowering time.
[16:12.740 --> 16:13.820]  The end is near.
[16:13.820 --> 16:14.820]  It's an annual plant.
[16:14.820 --> 16:16.420]  It's supposed to live for one year.
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.660]  Normally it would get a spring.
[16:17.660 --> 16:18.780]  It would get a summer.
[16:18.780 --> 16:22.100]  In the late summer, the time, the daylight hours would get shorter.
[16:22.100 --> 16:24.860]  That tells the plant, oh, winter is near.
[16:24.860 --> 16:25.860]  I better flower.
[16:25.860 --> 16:27.240]  The plant wants to make flowers.
[16:27.240 --> 16:28.980]  The flowers are the parts we are after.
[16:28.980 --> 16:32.100]  We want to smoke the dried flower tops.
[16:32.100 --> 16:36.340]  The plant's main goal is to receive pollen so that it can get pollinated, make seeds,
[16:36.340 --> 16:38.820]  and grow again next year.
[16:38.820 --> 16:43.340]  When we turn our timer to 12-12 to tell the plant to begin to flower, it starts stretching.
[16:43.340 --> 16:45.460]  That is a natural part of turning to flower.
[16:45.460 --> 16:47.700]  The plants just naturally stretch.
[16:47.700 --> 16:50.100]  Some strains will stretch more than others.
[16:50.100 --> 16:53.960]  That could be a tongue twister if I had one more dab.
[16:53.960 --> 16:55.480]  Research the strains you are growing with.
[16:55.480 --> 17:01.060]  A lot of my strains straight up will double in height, which means you need to flower
[17:01.060 --> 17:05.900]  your plants when they are halfway to your maximum height.
[17:05.900 --> 17:07.220]  Let me use a good example.
[17:07.220 --> 17:12.660]  If your grow space is six feet tall, let's say that you've got a six foot tall grow space.
[17:12.660 --> 17:14.420]  You've got to deduct the height of the light.
[17:14.420 --> 17:18.780]  Let's just say that from the floor to your light is six feet.
[17:18.780 --> 17:20.820]  Now we've got six feet of space.
[17:20.820 --> 17:24.740]  Let's keep in mind that we need space between the light and the top of the plant when we
[17:24.740 --> 17:25.740]  finish.
[17:25.740 --> 17:28.500]  Now we've worked ourselves down to five feet.
[17:28.500 --> 17:30.180]  That sounds about right in most environments.
[17:30.300 --> 17:31.300]  You can get about a foot.
[17:31.300 --> 17:35.180]  You may want to go 18 inches, two feet from the light, depending on your light, your air
[17:35.180 --> 17:36.180]  conditioning.
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.660]  Allow yourself that space, 18 inches.
[17:38.660 --> 17:40.500]  Let's just stick with 18 inches.
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.660]  Now you've got, we had six feet.
[17:42.660 --> 17:45.660]  You've got four and a half feet of growth space.
[17:45.660 --> 17:49.220]  If your plants are going to, now let's also think you've got a pot that's going to take
[17:49.220 --> 17:50.860]  six or 10 inches off.
[17:50.860 --> 17:54.420]  Let's just say you've got four feet of actual growth space now.
[17:54.420 --> 17:59.580]  I would say veg the plants until they are two feet tall, maybe a little bit taller,
[17:59.580 --> 18:01.460]  and then flip them into flower mode.
[18:01.460 --> 18:06.340]  If the plants double in size, they will finish at four feet tall, which leaves you a few
[18:06.340 --> 18:11.740]  inches height for the pot, which leaves you about a foot or 18 inches from your light.
[18:11.740 --> 18:18.620]  So ideally you would flower when your plants are about halfway to your maximum height.
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.480]  Now there are variables in here.
[18:20.480 --> 18:23.780]  Like I did mention, some plants are going to stretch a lot.
[18:23.780 --> 18:28.700]  Some plants won't stretch very much depending on your light spectrum, your light intensity,
[18:28.700 --> 18:34.780]  the kind of light you've got that may contribute or attribute to how much your plants do stretch.
[18:34.780 --> 18:37.540]  If you've got a lot of really good light, they won't stretch as much.
[18:37.540 --> 18:41.540]  If the plants aren't getting the right light, the right light spectrum, the right intensity,
[18:41.540 --> 18:44.260]  the right time period, they may stretch a little bit more.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.900]  They're getting up there looking for the light.
[18:45.900 --> 18:47.640]  That's why your plants are stretching.
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.100]  So be prepared for anticipate a double stretch when you're flowering a plant for the first
[18:53.100 --> 18:54.100]  time.
[18:54.100 --> 18:56.500]  Now there are other things that you need to keep in mind.
[18:56.500 --> 18:59.380]  Maybe you want to spread that plant out a little bit.
[18:59.380 --> 19:01.700]  You're going to run out of vertical space.
[19:01.700 --> 19:03.060]  Let's grow it horizontally.
[19:03.060 --> 19:06.220]  If you've got a plant that's stretching out of control, you can grab it and bend it over
[19:06.220 --> 19:08.980]  and tie it down so it doesn't get as tall.
[19:08.980 --> 19:11.260]  Of course, the branches are going to start growing up around it.
[19:11.260 --> 19:12.260]  It's still going to go up.
[19:12.260 --> 19:16.120]  That's what the plant naturally wants to do, but you can learn how to control it and keep
[19:16.120 --> 19:18.860]  it down so you can veg a little bit longer.
[19:18.860 --> 19:22.100]  You don't have to flower right away that way.
[19:22.100 --> 19:23.820]  Another thing we should think about is topping.
[19:23.820 --> 19:28.120]  When we top the plants, we're allowing it to grow into a nice even canopy, a nice bush.
[19:28.120 --> 19:31.820]  We took that main top out so those lower branches can catch up.
[19:31.820 --> 19:34.120]  Let all of that stuff fill your canopy.
[19:34.120 --> 19:38.460]  Let all of that stuff fill your grow space, then flip it so that way you can get all those
[19:38.460 --> 19:40.460]  bottom branches all even.
[19:40.460 --> 19:43.620]  That'll get you evened out so you don't have one big bud close to the light.
[19:43.620 --> 19:47.460]  You can get that one big bud and bend it over, or you can cut out the top and let the bottoms
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.460]  recover.
[19:48.460 --> 19:52.540]  You can do things to fill that space before you get one bud right up to the top of the
[19:52.540 --> 19:53.540]  light.
[19:53.540 --> 19:57.780]  Now, talking about bending plants over and breaking shit off, I think that popping and
[19:57.780 --> 20:01.940]  twisting our plants really slow down that vertical stretch.
[20:01.940 --> 20:04.260]  I've done a full episode about popping and twisting.
[20:04.260 --> 20:07.320]  I'll try to put a link to that in the show notes in the video description.
[20:07.320 --> 20:08.740]  You can click right on that one.
[20:08.740 --> 20:13.540]  I'll show you popping and twisting technique that does slow down the vertical growth because
[20:13.540 --> 20:17.260]  the plants are spending their energy repairing that pop and twist.
[20:17.260 --> 20:21.940]  That will not slow down or damage our buds in any way because at this point, there are
[20:21.940 --> 20:22.940]  no buds.
[20:23.340 --> 20:24.700]  The plants are just shifting their hormones.
[20:24.700 --> 20:27.340]  They're going from veg to flower.
[20:27.340 --> 20:29.100]  They're basically going through puberty.
[20:29.100 --> 20:31.380]  They need a couple of weeks for their hormones to adjust.
[20:31.380 --> 20:32.980]  Then they'll start making buds.
[20:32.980 --> 20:36.940]  So at this point, crack them, pop them, twist them, abuse them, get them short, get them
[20:36.940 --> 20:40.380]  the shape you want so that when they start building buds, they're right in the position
[20:40.380 --> 20:41.380]  we need them in.
[20:41.380 --> 20:46.140]  Now, I did just say that it's best to grow those plants up until you've got them halfway
[20:46.140 --> 20:49.840]  and fill your space, but it is not necessary.
[20:49.840 --> 20:53.040]  When I run new plants, plants I've never grown before, plants that I don't know what they're
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.800]  going to do, I don't want to waste time, space, and energy, nutrients, water, lights, all
[20:57.800 --> 21:01.120]  of the above, all of that stuff, real estate, space.
[21:01.120 --> 21:02.240]  It's all very expensive.
[21:02.240 --> 21:03.520]  It's all very precious to me.
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.520]  So when I'm running new stuff, I don't run those plants very big at all.
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.600]  I put them in a beer cup or a six-inch net pot, and I honestly veg them until they're
[21:11.600 --> 21:14.480]  about maybe six, eight inches tall.
[21:14.480 --> 21:16.760]  Then I flower them, and I don't do anything to them.
[21:16.760 --> 21:17.760]  I don't top them.
[21:17.760 --> 21:18.760]  I don't do any manipulation.
[21:18.760 --> 21:24.760]  I let them grow because I simply want to see what those seeds do, what I made new seeds,
[21:24.760 --> 21:27.080]  what do these plants do, what did I create?
[21:27.080 --> 21:28.400]  Do they grow beautiful plants?
[21:28.400 --> 21:29.400]  Do they grow a bunch of mutants?
[21:29.400 --> 21:31.680]  Is it a bunch of intersex trash?
[21:31.680 --> 21:32.960]  What did I create?
[21:32.960 --> 21:34.460]  Does it grow tall and skinny?
[21:34.460 --> 21:35.460]  Does it grow short and squat?
[21:35.460 --> 21:36.920]  Does it make cool colors?
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.080]  Did I just make a bunch of hemp?
[21:38.080 --> 21:41.120]  Is there a bunch of great trichome content coming out of there?
[21:41.120 --> 21:44.560]  I really want to know what I made, so I just grow little tiny plants.
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.920]  So don't think that you have to grow giant plants, but you can grow them about halfway.
[21:49.920 --> 21:50.920]  Flip when you are ready.
[21:50.920 --> 21:54.800]  Again, I really like to run new plants really small the first time.
[21:54.800 --> 21:58.520]  I see people throwing away plants that are like three and four feet tall, and they're
[21:58.520 --> 21:59.840]  like, turns out it was a male.
[21:59.840 --> 22:01.960]  I'm like, why did it ever get that big?
[22:01.960 --> 22:05.880]  You could have flowered it when it was this big and then put it back into veg.
[22:05.880 --> 22:08.920]  And for you guys that are listening, this big was the size of a GI Joe.
[22:08.920 --> 22:11.320]  What is that, four inches tall, three and three quarters?
[22:11.320 --> 22:13.000]  So you could have flowered it when it was that big.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.080]  It'll show you sex, put it right back in veg, then keep going.
[22:16.080 --> 22:17.240]  If it's a male, toss it.
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.400]  Don't waste your time.
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.240]  So when I'm running small stuff, I really do prefer tiny pots, tiny plants, because
[22:23.240 --> 22:25.440]  there's no need to run big old shit.
[22:25.440 --> 22:30.360]  Then what I do is, let's say that I've got a commercial environment and I can run a lot
[22:30.360 --> 22:34.980]  of plants, I would put a tray of plants underneath one light, like fill a four by four, a five
[22:34.980 --> 22:38.160]  by five section with just a tray of small plants.
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.040]  That way I can water the tray.
[22:40.040 --> 22:42.800]  Just put a pump that waters the tray every day, two times a day.
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.000]  So I don't even have to go there very often.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.320]  The commercial grows, I just pop in once a week and make sure shit's running, get my
[22:48.320 --> 22:50.440]  grow report, take my pictures and get out of there.
[22:50.440 --> 22:54.960]  It's a good way to do a pheno hunt, a test run, just a little sample run to see what
[22:54.960 --> 22:56.740]  you got going on.
[22:56.740 --> 23:00.400]  So let me recap here, because I did get quite rambly.
[23:00.400 --> 23:04.560]  A really easy way to determine when to flip your plants is when they are approximately
[23:04.560 --> 23:07.360]  half the height of your maximum grow space.
[23:07.360 --> 23:10.320]  You do have to keep in mind that you've got a pot underneath them, going to raise them
[23:10.320 --> 23:15.400]  up 10 to 12, maybe 14 inches, depending on the size of your pot and the height of your
[23:15.400 --> 23:16.400]  pot.
[23:16.400 --> 23:21.560]  Then you do have to consider the height between or the distance between your light and the
[23:21.560 --> 23:22.760]  top of your canopy.
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.240]  Depending on what kind of light you're using, you will need more space.
[23:26.240 --> 23:29.520]  In some of my grow environments, I've got the old school ducted lights.
[23:29.520 --> 23:34.200]  It's got, it's an HPS light with glass and a duct on it and a blower so that the heat
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.520]  from that light never makes it to my canopy.
[23:36.520 --> 23:38.440]  My plants can get quite close to that.
[23:38.760 --> 23:42.040]  At a commercial grow in Colorado Springs, we're using Govitas.
[23:42.040 --> 23:45.920]  Can't get very close to the Govitas because the plants will sizzle and burn.
[23:45.920 --> 23:48.760]  You're not supposed to burn them until you dry and cure them.
[23:48.760 --> 23:52.600]  You got to stay at least like 16, 18 inches away from those Govitas.
[23:52.600 --> 23:54.760]  12 inches is fucking scary.
[23:54.760 --> 23:56.800]  The plants start looking like shit.
[23:56.800 --> 24:01.440]  Then some of the LEDs, depending on the intensity, the spectrum, you can get really close or
[24:01.440 --> 24:04.680]  really far away with some of the LEDs, depending on what you're fucking with.
[24:04.680 --> 24:11.800]  So in that case, keeping the plants the distance from the light, I would definitely recommend
[24:11.800 --> 24:15.680]  most of those lights are going to come with a recommendation from the manufacturer.
[24:15.680 --> 24:18.160]  Follow that, but go too high.
[24:18.160 --> 24:20.020]  Most of you are limited on ceiling height.
[24:20.020 --> 24:21.400]  Go as high as you can.
[24:21.400 --> 24:24.880]  Turn the light to about 50% and see how the plants react.
[24:24.880 --> 24:27.440]  You can go closer and more intense.
[24:27.440 --> 24:31.240]  It's better for the plants to show you, I want more light than for the plants to say,
[24:31.240 --> 24:32.680]  I've had too much light.
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.680]  Watch this.
[24:33.680 --> 24:39.000]  The reaction from less light is way easier to fix than the reaction from too much light.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.920]  Now I've got one more detail that I should add.
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.160]  Being a very experienced grower who's done this for a long time, let me say that you
[24:45.160 --> 24:48.880]  are expecting eight, maybe nine weeks until harvest.
[24:48.880 --> 24:51.000]  Give yourself an extra week or two.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.760]  Allow room and height for an extra week or two of growth that you're not expecting.
[24:56.760 --> 24:59.960]  These plants need to grow longer than you're going to allow them.
[24:59.960 --> 25:00.960]  They're not done yet.
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.520]  When you think they're done, they're not done.
[25:02.520 --> 25:05.000]  Every new grower wants to cut down early.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.240]  Give yourself the extra time.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.360]  Give yourself the extra height.
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.480]  If you allow the extra height, you eliminate the excuse of they are too tall, I need to
[25:11.480 --> 25:12.800]  cut them early.
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.960]  Allow them to finish, plan ahead for that extra height.
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.340]  It's super frustrating late in a grow when you're trying to figure out how to bend these
[25:20.340 --> 25:24.800]  branches over and lower shit because you've only got 10 more days, but everything's growing
[25:24.800 --> 25:25.800]  into the light.
[25:25.800 --> 25:27.680]  You're trying to figure out, am I going to turn down the light?
[25:27.680 --> 25:28.680]  Do I tip the light?
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.640]  Do I turn the light fucking sideways?
[25:30.640 --> 25:32.760]  Anyway, bend this fucking branch over.
[25:32.760 --> 25:33.880]  What do I do?
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.720]  It's always such a frustrating 10 days if you don't prepare for that last bit of growth.
[25:38.720 --> 25:40.400]  Set yourself up for success.
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.700]  Give yourself plenty of space between the top of your plant and your light.
[25:44.700 --> 25:45.700]  Plan ahead.
[25:45.700 --> 25:48.640]  Probably flip about half of your space.
[25:48.640 --> 25:51.560]  I usually grow my plants to about ... I'm six foot five.
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.040]  I usually grow my plants about knee high and then I flower them.
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.880]  In a three gallon pot, they get topped once, grow until they're about knee high.
[25:59.880 --> 26:00.880]  Then I flower them.
[26:00.880 --> 26:07.120]  They finish out about maybe just below my chest area, low chest area.
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.160]  That's just about perfect for an indoor garden.
[26:09.160 --> 26:13.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[26:13.320 --> 26:17.480]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
[26:17.480 --> 26:20.480]  there, I want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow From
[26:20.480 --> 26:22.060]  Your Heart Podcast.
[26:22.060 --> 26:27.760]  When I say episode 683, it makes me feel weird and great inside.
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.400]  It's amazing to think you guys have stuck around for 683 episodes.
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.520]  I hope we do 683 more together.
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.520]  Big thanks.
[26:36.520 --> 26:39.760]  All of the words of encouragement, all of the compliments keep me going.
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.000]  I will reconsider reading some of the YouTube comments.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.600]  You guys did kind of encourage me to read those YouTube comments.
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.440]  Here's the deal.
[26:48.440 --> 26:49.840]  Outnumber the trolls.
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.040]  Fill my inbox, fill my comment section up with positive words of encouragement, great
[26:54.040 --> 26:55.040]  feedback.
[26:55.240 --> 26:58.560]  Just totally wash out the trolls and I'll go read them.
[26:58.560 --> 26:59.560]  That's the deal I'll make with you.
[26:59.560 --> 27:04.680]  If you guys boost me up, fill it up with love and positivity and make it to where I can't
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.320]  even see all the troll comments, then I'll go check.
[27:08.320 --> 27:10.880]  Something else I should mention, a lot of the troll comments don't even make it to the
[27:10.880 --> 27:11.880]  public.
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.120]  I have to review them, so only I get to read all the abusive shit.
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.640]  I get to decline it and tell YouTube, don't post that abusive shit.
[27:18.640 --> 27:21.720]  A lot of them have to go through me for review before you even get to see it.
[27:21.720 --> 27:24.920]  Anyway, you guys sent me a lot of great messages saying, bro, just read the comments because
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.800]  we love you, we want to support you.
[27:26.800 --> 27:27.800]  Thank you.
[27:27.800 --> 27:28.800]  Fill those comments up.
[27:28.800 --> 27:29.800]  I will read them.
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.200]  Just outnumber those silly trolls.
[27:31.200 --> 27:34.360]  Anyway, let's wrap up this show before I dig that hole any deeper.
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.840]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know that I would love to
[27:37.840 --> 27:38.840]  hear from you.

[27:44.800 --> 27:47.440]  Also, don't forget about the Discord server.
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.960]  There's a great thing happening on the Discord server.
[27:49.960 --> 27:51.160]  It ends around Halloween.
[27:51.160 --> 27:53.200]  It is a trick or treat thing.
[27:53.200 --> 27:54.880]  I can't say any more.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.840]  Please do check out the Discord for more details and information.
[27:58.840 --> 28:01.960]  There is a link to the Discord and the show notes and the video description, but to make
[28:01.960 --> 28:05.920]  it nice and easy, just go to my website, iregenetics.com.
[28:05.920 --> 28:07.400]  All of the links you need are right there.
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.280]  There are vendor links, the Discord link, the newsletter link.

[28:12.480 --> 28:14.600]  Check it out at iregenetics.com.
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.680]  All right.
[28:15.680 --> 28:19.040]  My throat is telling me it is time to wrap up the show, so I'm going to say goodnight
[28:19.040 --> 28:20.040]  for now.
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.320]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:22.360 --> 28:25.520]  Let's give a giant shout out to my buddy Made While Medicated.
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.120]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
