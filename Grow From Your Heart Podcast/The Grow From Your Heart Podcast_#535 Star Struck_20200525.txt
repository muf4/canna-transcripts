[00:00.320 --> 00:03.040]  All right, sounds like the microphone is working.
[00:03.040 --> 00:04.540]  It looks like the camera is working.
[00:04.540 --> 00:06.640]  I think it is time to do a podcast.
[00:06.640 --> 00:07.840]  Here we go.
[00:07.840 --> 00:08.840]  What's up podcast world?
[00:08.840 --> 00:15.440]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 535 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:15.440 --> 00:19.920]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at seedsherenow.com.

[00:53.320 --> 00:56.920]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.840]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Garlic Grove Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.480]  On the package, it says this is a blend of GMO cookies and LOAF2.
[01:07.480 --> 01:12.120]  The flavor is described as General Tso's Garlic and Orange Soda.
[01:12.120 --> 01:15.480]  I'm going to completely agree with that flavor description.
[01:15.480 --> 01:20.600]  When I crack the jar open, I am hit with this pungent, funky, delicious orange aroma.
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.260]  It is almost like a nasty, potent, gross oranges, maybe oranges and armpits coming out of here
[01:26.260 --> 01:28.140]  right when I open it.
[01:28.140 --> 01:32.100]  Then when I take a dab, I was overwhelmed by orange and citrus.
[01:32.100 --> 01:34.820]  My mouth was loaded up with orange turps.
[01:34.820 --> 01:38.260]  Then on the exhale, that is when that garlic kind of kicks in.
[01:38.260 --> 01:40.500]  It kind of just lingers on the tongue.
[01:40.500 --> 01:44.340]  After you smoke it, you have it sort of tastes like you ate orange garlic chicken or orange
[01:44.340 --> 01:49.420]  garlic tofu if you're a hippie, but it's got that orange garlic general so flavor to it.
[01:49.420 --> 01:50.420]  Really delicious.
[01:50.420 --> 01:55.780]  Also, obviously, it has got me good and stoned, nice and talkative, really good concentrate.
[01:55.780 --> 02:01.420]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Garlic Grove Live
[02:01.420 --> 02:02.420]  Batter.
[02:02.420 --> 02:05.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I do have a great podcast for you.
[02:05.760 --> 02:08.460]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain highlight.
[02:08.460 --> 02:11.740]  We're going to talk about a strain called Starstruck.
[02:11.740 --> 02:16.220]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show
[02:16.220 --> 02:19.500]  on Patreon.
[02:19.500 --> 02:22.460]  Let's start off by sending a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[02:22.460 --> 02:24.380]  my good friend Grimbolded Druid.
[02:24.380 --> 02:27.500]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my friend OG Purple Thumb.

[02:46.240 --> 02:50.060]  Of course, let's send a big giant shout out to my buddy Nick Dude.
[02:50.060 --> 02:54.460]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out
[02:54.460 --> 02:57.520]  to all of our friends out there at Hogan's Farms.
[02:57.520 --> 03:01.580]  Big thanks, big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.

[03:04.380 --> 03:11.300]  have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:11.300 --> 03:14.300]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:14.300 --> 03:18.860]  Once again, big thank you to everybody who has continued to support the show.
[03:19.660 --> 03:21.660]  All right, I did receive a great email.
[03:21.660 --> 03:25.300]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis culture or cultivation question that you would like
[03:25.300 --> 03:27.340]  me to answer on the show, you can send me an email.
[03:27.340 --> 03:30.820]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[03:30.820 --> 03:32.380]  You know I would love to hear from you.
[03:32.380 --> 03:36.700]  The email for today's episode goes just like this.
[03:36.700 --> 03:41.660]  It says, Hey Ross to Jeff, I listen to a lot of podcasts on similar subject matters and
[03:41.660 --> 03:47.260]  you are the best speaking voice in terms of pronunciation, thoroughness, if that's a correct
[03:47.260 --> 03:53.420]  word and truly making points of a clear understanding details for your audience to comprehend.
[03:53.420 --> 03:54.420]  That means a lot to me.
[03:54.420 --> 03:55.420]  Thank you.
[03:55.420 --> 04:00.460]  I get a lot of emails from people saying they cannot fucking stand the way that I talk.
[04:00.460 --> 04:04.180]  That is cool with me because I try to speak very clearly so that people can understand
[04:04.180 --> 04:05.180]  me.
[04:05.180 --> 04:07.660]  Some people don't like that I make too many pauses.
[04:07.660 --> 04:09.120]  Part of that honestly is for editing.
[04:09.120 --> 04:13.700]  It's much easier to edit a short pause instead of editing a long run on sentence to where
[04:13.700 --> 04:17.300]  when I'm talking and talking that then there's a new sentence and it's just a weird skip
[04:17.300 --> 04:18.300]  and an edit.
[04:18.300 --> 04:21.100]  So a couple of pauses do allow for some easier editing.
[04:21.100 --> 04:23.660]  Also I think it's easier for people to understand.
[04:23.660 --> 04:26.380]  A couple of pauses make me think of my talking speed.
[04:26.380 --> 04:31.100]  I can get really carried away and talk really fast if I don't take some breaths and pauses.
[04:31.100 --> 04:34.420]  So the pauses are for all of us to get along a little better.
[04:34.420 --> 04:35.420]  It makes the teaching better.
[04:35.420 --> 04:37.820]  It makes me pay more attention.
[04:37.820 --> 04:39.780]  So I apologize if people don't like the pauses.
[04:39.780 --> 04:41.860]  The good part is this person really enjoys it.
[04:41.860 --> 04:42.980]  They think that I speak well.
[04:43.260 --> 04:47.660]  They think I speak clearly and I've got thoroughness if that's even a real word.
[04:47.660 --> 04:48.660]  But I know what you mean.
[04:48.660 --> 04:53.020]  I do sometimes try to look at a subject from multiple different angles because I know that
[04:53.020 --> 04:56.060]  people learn from way different styles.
[04:56.060 --> 04:59.320]  A lot of people have to actually put their hands on something to learn something.
[04:59.320 --> 05:02.420]  Some people have to learn it like in a creative way.
[05:02.420 --> 05:04.660]  Some people have to learn it in a real analytical way.
[05:04.660 --> 05:10.620]  I try to approach teaching in a way that everybody can learn because I really love to learn.
[05:10.620 --> 05:12.060]  Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[05:12.140 --> 05:14.620]  I'm going to blame that on our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[05:14.620 --> 05:17.300]  I really love to learn but I did not like school.
[05:17.300 --> 05:20.860]  Sitting there for hours at a time having somebody drone on about some bullshit.
[05:20.860 --> 05:22.180]  It really bored me.
[05:22.180 --> 05:26.500]  When I had creative teachers who engaged and didn't just stand in front of the class at
[05:26.500 --> 05:30.860]  a board and write shit on a board if they gave us activities, I noticed that I excelled
[05:30.860 --> 05:33.840]  and enjoyed that class better.
[05:33.840 --> 05:37.540]  So my goal is to try to teach in a way that I can keep people focused and entertained.
[05:37.540 --> 05:38.900]  And then I'm kind of a smart ass.
[05:38.900 --> 05:40.220]  I tell some jokes in there.
[05:40.220 --> 05:43.700]  So I feel like those nuggets of funny are like little rewards for all the learning.
[05:43.700 --> 05:47.420]  Your brain, learn, learn, learn, laughter, learn, learn, learn, laughter.
[05:47.420 --> 05:48.420]  And it helps your brain.
[05:48.420 --> 05:49.420]  It helps us all function.
[05:49.420 --> 05:51.900]  Anyway, I'm fucking stoned and rambly.
[05:51.900 --> 05:56.100]  Thank you for noticing that I try hard to teach in a way that everybody can comprehend.
[05:56.100 --> 06:01.300]  It goes on to say, I find so many broadcasters come across mumbly-ish or they repeat silly
[06:01.300 --> 06:03.980]  phrases like, you know what I'm saying?
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.060]  Or they say like a lot.
[06:05.060 --> 06:07.460]  A lot of people do say like too many times.
[06:07.460 --> 06:09.420]  I do catch myself saying catchphrases.
[06:09.420 --> 06:12.060]  You know that I've got all the catchphrases at the start of the show and shit.
[06:12.060 --> 06:15.820]  But I thank you for noticing I try not to say, you know what I'm saying?
[06:15.820 --> 06:18.340]  And like and shit like that, because that drives me crazy.
[06:18.340 --> 06:19.540]  You don't know what I'm saying.
[06:19.540 --> 06:21.300]  If you knew what I was saying, I wouldn't have to say it.
[06:21.300 --> 06:23.900]  So you know what I'm saying is, no, I don't know what you're saying.
[06:23.900 --> 06:24.900]  Tell me, right?
[06:24.900 --> 06:26.960]  It's fucking language is crazy.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.340]  And I appreciate it when people speak well.
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.380]  So thank you for noticing that I try hard.
[06:30.380 --> 06:34.580]  It also goes on to say, not only do I and others take your show more seriously because
[06:34.580 --> 06:38.380]  of your professional sounding approach and detail, but also the good vibes of sharing
[06:38.380 --> 06:41.180]  and caring you put through shines through.
[06:41.180 --> 06:42.420]  Man, thank you a lot.
[06:42.420 --> 06:44.580]  I appreciate that.
[06:44.580 --> 06:48.180]  I think that speaking well shows that my brain is working and I fucking put some thought
[06:48.180 --> 06:49.460]  into this.
[06:49.460 --> 06:51.980]  And then what's the part that I really liked there?
[06:51.980 --> 06:54.420]  Professional sounding approach, that's mandatory.
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.220]  The good vibes, I'm glad that comes through.
[06:56.220 --> 06:57.860]  I don't know that that shows.
[06:57.860 --> 06:59.540]  I just recently started doing videos.
[06:59.540 --> 07:03.060]  So now you can see my smiling face and see that I'm filled with good vibes.
[07:03.060 --> 07:05.380]  But I don't know that good vibes come through on a recording.
[07:05.380 --> 07:07.060]  That wasn't, I try to have fun.
[07:07.060 --> 07:09.820]  I said a moment ago, I try to be kind of funny and tell jokes.
[07:09.820 --> 07:11.340]  I'm a fucking witty, funny dude.
[07:11.340 --> 07:12.860]  I'm kind of, I like to have fun.
[07:12.860 --> 07:13.860]  Fun is important to me.
[07:13.860 --> 07:15.540]  If you're not having fun, what the fuck are you having?
[07:15.540 --> 07:17.340]  So I'm glad that you get the good vibes.
[07:17.340 --> 07:19.700]  It's hard to know that that is conveying in a recording.
[07:19.700 --> 07:21.740]  I don't know that I'm passing that on.
[07:21.740 --> 07:24.540]  I just know that when I'm editing, I'm not looking for good vibes.
[07:24.540 --> 07:26.020]  Do you sound like a good vibe?
[07:26.020 --> 07:27.920]  That's not on my list of shit to look for.
[07:27.920 --> 07:29.300]  So I'm glad that that's coming through.
[07:29.300 --> 07:30.300]  Thank you.
[07:30.300 --> 07:33.580]  Guys, I'm rambling, but I promise we will get to the point of this podcast today.
[07:33.580 --> 07:34.620]  We only have so much time.
[07:34.620 --> 07:37.100]  So we've got to get there eventually.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.820]  Then it says, I have one request.
[07:38.820 --> 07:43.260]  Please do an episode on your varieties, Space Force and on Starstruck.
[07:43.260 --> 07:47.320]  These were freebies I recently received through Oregon Elite Seeds.
[07:47.320 --> 07:51.300]  Thank you for all that you create, created and continue to create.
[07:51.300 --> 07:52.700]  Big up from Joe.
[07:52.700 --> 07:54.280]  Hey, Joe, thank you.
[07:54.280 --> 07:55.280]  This is a great message.
[07:55.280 --> 07:58.340]  It's filled with compliments, specific compliments.
[07:58.340 --> 07:59.700]  You let me know why you like the show.
[07:59.700 --> 08:00.700]  That means a lot to me.
[08:00.700 --> 08:01.940]  So I know what I'm doing right.
[08:01.940 --> 08:03.500]  You told me that the vibe comes through.
[08:03.500 --> 08:05.100]  That means a lot to me.
[08:05.100 --> 08:07.540]  And you set me up for a really good episode.
[08:07.540 --> 08:11.820]  You asked about two strains that I've created called Space Force and Starstruck.
[08:11.820 --> 08:15.180]  Well, my friend, I'm going to highlight both of those strains.
[08:15.180 --> 08:17.700]  We're going to do two separate episodes.
[08:17.700 --> 08:20.340]  Again, excuse me for the throat clearing, you guys.
[08:20.340 --> 08:23.080]  I'm not even going to edit that because we're doing video now.
[08:23.080 --> 08:24.580]  We're just going to keep rolling through it.
[08:24.580 --> 08:28.780]  I'm going to clear my throat a lot of times because I took some fat, fat dabs earlier,
[08:28.780 --> 08:33.540]  but we're going to do two back to back episodes here that are going to be strain reviews.
[08:33.540 --> 08:39.260]  I feel if I do both of these strains in one episode, the information will get convoluted
[08:39.260 --> 08:43.140]  and people's brains will mash the details up into one thing.
[08:43.140 --> 08:47.220]  So I've got to do two separate episodes to do the two strains for you just to keep shit
[08:47.220 --> 08:49.320]  straight for you and for me.
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.540]  So in this episode, we are going to review a strain which I created called Starstruck.
[08:54.540 --> 08:56.540]  So let's jump right into it.
[08:57.100 --> 08:59.340]  Starstruck is a strain I created.
[08:59.340 --> 09:02.220]  What were the parents of Starstruck?
[09:02.220 --> 09:05.220]  Starstruck was bred from Stardog.
[09:05.220 --> 09:07.820]  Stardog female to an Arise male.
[09:07.820 --> 09:10.060]  Let's talk about the Stardog first.
[09:10.060 --> 09:12.320]  We'll go ladies first.
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.620]  Stardog is a cross of Chem4 and Tresdog.
[09:15.620 --> 09:19.800]  So you can tell it's already got a lot of dog dominant genetics in there.
[09:19.800 --> 09:22.100]  That Chem4 is one of my favorites to grow.
[09:22.100 --> 09:23.860]  A lot of people love the Chem4.
[09:23.860 --> 09:25.360]  I did grow the Tresdog.
[09:25.360 --> 09:27.880]  It was a little bit of a pain in the ass.
[09:27.880 --> 09:30.400]  It wasn't my favorite to grow in a commercial facility.
[09:30.400 --> 09:33.800]  If you didn't get it just right, it didn't grow just right for you.
[09:33.800 --> 09:34.800]  It would give you problems.
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.920]  If you overwatered, overfed, if you pissed it off in any way, instead of making one giant
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.640]  cola up the middle of the plant, it would do one stick with a little popcorn bud on
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.920]  one side and then a couple inches away up it, it would do another popcorn bud.
[09:48.920 --> 09:50.800]  Just a few golf balls up the main branch.
[09:50.800 --> 09:53.480]  That main cola would never fill in if you pissed it off.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.360]  That was the Tresdog.
[09:55.360 --> 09:58.200]  Chem4 grows like a fucking savage.
[09:58.200 --> 09:59.680]  Chem4 is really easy to grow.
[09:59.680 --> 10:00.680]  It grows like a champ.
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.680]  It does a lot of great turps.
[10:03.680 --> 10:05.320]  It's really bug resistant.
[10:05.320 --> 10:06.320]  It's easy to grow.
[10:06.320 --> 10:08.360]  I love Chem4, the aroma, the flavor, the buzz.
[10:08.360 --> 10:09.800]  It's just a great strain.
[10:09.800 --> 10:13.960]  So it is Chem4 to the Tresdog.
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.920]  It got my attention as a consumer because it's got a really good gassy aroma.
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.200]  It's gassy, it's funky, it's got some earth to it.
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.880]  When I say that strains have certain aromas and flavors, you have to keep in mind that
[10:26.880 --> 10:32.080]  different growers in different environments are going to get different flavors and aromas.
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.560]  We can take this Stardog Cut and put it in seven grows and we're going to get seven different
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.840]  flavors, but they are all going to have this base of a gassiness.
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.480]  It's gassy and skunky.
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.960]  And then I noticed that when I grow it in a commercial facility with New Millennium
[10:47.960 --> 10:55.720]  Nutrients, I do find a little bit of strawberry or watermelon hints to the after flavor.
[10:55.720 --> 10:57.120]  So the start is gas.
[10:57.120 --> 10:59.360]  It's gassy, it's dirty, it's funky.
[10:59.360 --> 11:01.600]  It's got a little bit of feet and feel to it.
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.720]  And then you inhale.
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.560]  And then as you exhale, there's this, this strawberry watermelon turp to it.
[11:07.560 --> 11:09.320]  I just think it's a, and my brain is weird.
[11:09.320 --> 11:10.800]  I see flavors and colors.
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.400]  It's a really soft pink color and flavor.
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.280]  It's not bubble gummy, but it is watermelon-y and strawberry.
[11:17.280 --> 11:19.280]  So that's my crazy brain description of flavor.
[11:19.280 --> 11:22.120]  It's gassy with hints of watermelon and strawberry.
[11:22.120 --> 11:27.120]  The phenotype that I grew, the grow that I'm familiar with, lots of gas, hints of feet,
[11:27.120 --> 11:29.360]  lots of watermelon and strawberry.
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.800]  So that was one of the things that got my attention and it gets me so high.
[11:33.800 --> 11:36.800]  It gives me a really desirable high.
[11:36.800 --> 11:37.800]  Good head buzz.
[11:37.800 --> 11:38.800]  It makes my eyes heavy.
[11:38.800 --> 11:42.600]  It makes me think like some, some weeds, some concentrates go to your body.
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.560]  Some concentrates give you cotton mouth.
[11:44.560 --> 11:45.560]  Some go right to the brain.
[11:45.560 --> 11:48.920]  This one hit me in the eyes and in my head, I was high.
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.440]  Like I wasn't stoned.
[11:50.440 --> 11:52.980]  When I smoke Stardog, I actually get high and I smoke a lot.
[11:52.980 --> 11:55.600]  So it takes a little bit to get me really high.
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.840]  And I think it's that Chem 4, the Trez Dog, that Chem family stuff gets to me.
[11:59.840 --> 12:02.400]  So I really love the buzz.
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.780]  When you grow it, you see a lot of trichomes, a lot of trichomes.
[12:05.780 --> 12:07.120]  They start popping up early.
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.200]  They coat the plant.
[12:08.200 --> 12:09.960]  They get really thick on the plant.
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.960]  Lots of trichomes.
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.600]  The Stardog makes great concentrates.
[12:12.600 --> 12:17.480]  Apothecary Farms makes a Stardog batter that if they've got a four gram jar of it, I will
[12:17.480 --> 12:19.320]  take it every time it's on the shelf.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.800]  I love that Stardog batter.
[12:21.800 --> 12:24.080]  So it makes a lot of trichomes.
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.360]  Stardog has a really good structure, except for sometimes if it doesn't get enough light,
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.360]  if you don't have enough wind, the bottom branches will grow sideways instead of up.
[12:34.360 --> 12:37.080]  They start going horizontally instead of vertically.
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.920]  They try to get out to the end of the plant, then they go up so they can get away from
[12:40.920 --> 12:43.000]  the rest of the branches and get that light.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.580]  So sometimes if you don't have enough light, it can be a little bit of a bitch.
[12:46.580 --> 12:48.680]  Most of the time, it's an amazing grower.
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.980]  It's really good to grow, in my opinion, in a commercial environment.
[12:53.980 --> 13:00.320]  Growing Stardog, if I had to get a bonus, if we had an issue in the previous grow, Stardog
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.960]  is how I would make up for it in the next grow.
[13:02.960 --> 13:06.000]  If we wanted to get a bonus, if we wanted to fill a room with something we knew would
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.840]  kick ass, if we had a 420 sale coming and we needed a lot of product, fill a room with
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.840]  Stardog.
[13:11.840 --> 13:12.840]  It will please you.
[13:12.840 --> 13:15.520]  You'll get a lot of quality product.
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.240]  It's really easy to grow.
[13:17.240 --> 13:18.520]  You don't make mistakes with it.
[13:18.520 --> 13:20.640]  It's forgiving is what I think I'm trying to say.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.560]  If you make a mistake, it will bounce back.
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.620]  You can overwater it, you can overfeed it, and it won't be too pissed off.
[13:26.620 --> 13:28.360]  It's really good for commercial growing.
[13:28.360 --> 13:29.920]  It kicks out great lab tests.
[13:29.920 --> 13:32.680]  The potency, the turps are always great in the labs.
[13:32.680 --> 13:34.780]  It never ever had any problems.
[13:34.780 --> 13:36.860]  It's got amazing bag appeal.
[13:36.860 --> 13:39.180]  The shapes of the buds are beautiful.
[13:39.180 --> 13:43.300]  They're nice and dense, but not too dense to where the bags look small.
[13:43.300 --> 13:44.300]  It just sells.
[13:44.300 --> 13:48.580]  Once you put it in a jar and put it on the shelf, the colors, the bag appeal, the smell,
[13:48.580 --> 13:49.580]  people want it.
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.300]  They see that lab test on it.
[13:51.300 --> 13:54.940]  High 20s, low 30s in the numbers, people really want that.
[13:54.940 --> 13:58.220]  I really found Stardog to be an excellent commercial strain.
[13:58.220 --> 13:59.460]  You can tell I grew it a lot.
[13:59.460 --> 14:00.460]  I fell in love with it.
[14:00.460 --> 14:01.980]  It was one of my favorites.
[14:01.980 --> 14:03.880]  The commercial grow guys couldn't mess it up.
[14:03.980 --> 14:07.760]  If you had plants in that commercial grow, like the Tres dog, they could kill that one.
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.520]  The Stardog, it would just survive through everything if they messed up.
[14:11.520 --> 14:13.080]  I love growing the Stardog.
[14:13.080 --> 14:14.160]  I can make bonuses.
[14:14.160 --> 14:15.480]  I love to smoke it.
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.720]  It was a grower and a smoker's dream.
[14:17.720 --> 14:20.460]  It was a commercial cultivator's best friend.
[14:20.460 --> 14:21.760]  We could grow a lot of it.
[14:21.760 --> 14:22.960]  It didn't take a lot of time.
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.280]  It would put out really well.
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.560]  Then once it hit the shelf, it would disappear.
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.160]  That is Stardog.
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.080]  I took my male Arise plant.
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.360]  I've got a male Arise plant known as King Solomon.
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.200]  If you listen to my podcast a lot, you've learned all about King Solomon.
[14:38.200 --> 14:44.120]  King Solomon is a very unique, selected male cultivar of Arise.
[14:44.120 --> 14:46.720]  Arise is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.040]  Golden Goat is Island Sweetskunk, Hawaiian Sativa, and Romulan.
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.160]  Daybreaker is Chemde and Joseph Ogee.
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.560]  I did that without looking at my notes.
[14:55.560 --> 14:56.560]  I'm proud of myself.
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.600]  I took a really tropical Sativa dominant type of a plant.
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.080]  That was pollinated by an Ogee-Cush-Chemdog combination plant.
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.200]  I had tropical sweet flavors and those dank, stanky, skunky, earthy, savory flavors.
[15:11.200 --> 15:14.040]  I crossed that and that made Arise.
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.920]  There is an Arise phenotype that is known as Arise number four because it was number
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.700]  four in the garden that tests very high in THC.
[15:21.700 --> 15:27.460]  My friend Miles in New Mexico grew out an Arise plant and he tested that plant at 35.84%
[15:27.460 --> 15:35.020]  THC A. This plant is known to put out amazing lab numbers, very high THC results.
[15:35.020 --> 15:40.760]  When I use the male Arise plant, everything I pollinate with that plant becomes better
[15:40.760 --> 15:42.820]  than it was before.
[15:42.820 --> 15:46.240]  There wasn't anything wrong with the Stardog plant.
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.900]  I just thought that by pollinating it with my Arise plant that I could probably make
[15:51.100 --> 15:55.420]  something bigger, faster, and better because that is what it is known for.
[15:55.420 --> 16:00.460]  I feel like I mostly, mostly, that word was hard for my face to say, I feel like I mostly
[16:00.460 --> 16:09.540]  hit my goal except for too many phenotypes of this cross are just remakes of the Stardog.
[16:09.540 --> 16:12.220]  Most of them, a lot of them come out just like Stardog.
[16:12.220 --> 16:14.020]  I didn't make anything too different.
[16:14.020 --> 16:18.020]  A lot of them are Stardog dominant, but they grow a little bit more quickly.
[16:18.020 --> 16:21.100]  Some of them are Stardog with sweeter flavors and aromas.
[16:21.100 --> 16:23.700]  But unfortunately, I like what I made.
[16:23.700 --> 16:24.700]  I mean, it kicks ass.
[16:24.700 --> 16:28.620]  It's a really great cross, but I was trying to do something new and it mostly came out
[16:28.620 --> 16:31.760]  like one of the parent plants, which I understand why.
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.700]  If you look at the genetics, if you look at King Solomon, there is ChemD in there.
[16:35.700 --> 16:38.000]  So there's Chemdog in King Solomon.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.220]  There's Chemdog in the Stardog.
[16:40.220 --> 16:41.660]  There's Chem4, there's Tresdog.
[16:41.660 --> 16:42.660]  There's a lot of Chem happening.
[16:42.660 --> 16:45.380]  So it was all already kind of put together.
[16:45.380 --> 16:48.660]  All of my ingredients already tasted like chem, looked and smelled like chem.
[16:48.660 --> 16:50.600]  So it came out very chem.
[16:50.600 --> 16:52.520]  But I do get a lot of trichome development.
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.140]  I do get a lot of hyper vigor, and I do get some really unique phenotypes.
[16:57.140 --> 17:00.380]  Now let's talk a little bit more about Star Struck here.
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.660]  The outcome was perfect.
[17:01.660 --> 17:04.020]  It's a really great commercial plant.
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.980]  It is a better commercial plant than the Stardog was.
[17:06.980 --> 17:07.980]  It grows more quickly.
[17:07.980 --> 17:09.980]  It makes larger buds.
[17:09.980 --> 17:14.740]  Some of the phenotypes flower longer, but some of the phenotypes flower more quickly.
[17:15.100 --> 17:17.900]  So if you're looking for a great commercial plant and you can't get your hands on the
[17:17.900 --> 17:22.380]  Stardog or you want something different, the Star Struck would be perfect for you.
[17:22.380 --> 17:24.620]  It is very PM resistant.
[17:24.620 --> 17:26.340]  It is very bug resistant.
[17:26.340 --> 17:29.620]  I've noticed that many phenotypes do not get bugs.
[17:29.620 --> 17:33.100]  It puts out really big fat friendly yields.
[17:33.100 --> 17:35.980]  That's why I said earlier, it is great for commercial production.
[17:35.980 --> 17:39.820]  If you just need to put out fat weight, this is the plant for you.
[17:39.820 --> 17:41.580]  The aromas are beautiful.
[17:41.580 --> 17:44.100]  Like I said, it's very much like Stardog.
[17:44.100 --> 17:47.860]  It's got that gassy, we've got so much chem going on in here.
[17:47.860 --> 17:51.300]  We've got Joseph OG that it's got that gassy feet thing.
[17:51.300 --> 17:55.060]  Then a lot of the phenotypes because of the golden goat side of the arise, you're going
[17:55.060 --> 17:56.220]  to get that sweetness in there.
[17:56.220 --> 17:57.420]  You're going to get that watermelon.
[17:57.420 --> 17:59.020]  You're going to get some strawberries.
[17:59.020 --> 18:03.500]  We even get some sort of grapefruit sort of turps coming out of some of these.
[18:03.500 --> 18:07.900]  There are a lot of really cool phenotypes, but again, most of them are going to be Stardog
[18:07.900 --> 18:09.340]  dominant.
[18:09.340 --> 18:11.340]  And that is why I'm just going to drop this now.
[18:11.340 --> 18:15.180]  That is why I discontinued making star struck seeds.
[18:15.180 --> 18:19.540]  There are still star struck seeds available.
[18:19.540 --> 18:20.540]  You say it, don't stutter.
[18:20.540 --> 18:21.540]  I dare you.
[18:21.540 --> 18:25.580]  There are star struck seeds still available at many vendors, but I will not be making
[18:25.580 --> 18:27.540]  them anymore.
[18:27.540 --> 18:31.140]  Mainly because I didn't do anything too new.
[18:31.140 --> 18:34.340]  It came out very star struck or Stardog dominant.
[18:34.340 --> 18:38.260]  And there are plenty of other breeders out there working with Stardog.
[18:38.260 --> 18:41.020]  Stardog is not a cross I made that was made by somebody else.
[18:41.700 --> 18:43.820]  I'll let that breeder work with that and do that work.
[18:43.820 --> 18:45.380]  I'm going to stop playing with it.
[18:45.380 --> 18:46.900]  I did what I wanted to do.
[18:46.900 --> 18:47.900]  It's a great cross.
[18:47.900 --> 18:49.940]  Also, for some reason, it never took off.
[18:49.940 --> 18:50.940]  I advertised it.
[18:50.940 --> 18:51.940]  We talked about it.
[18:51.940 --> 18:53.420]  I just never really went anywhere.
[18:53.420 --> 18:56.460]  I'm sure after this episode comes out, a few more packs will move.
[18:56.460 --> 19:01.100]  But I don't know how some strains really gain traction and some really don't.
[19:01.100 --> 19:02.780]  I guess they're hitters or they're not.
[19:02.780 --> 19:04.300]  But the star struck, nobody cared.
[19:04.300 --> 19:05.660]  I advertised it.
[19:05.660 --> 19:06.740]  I put it out.
[19:06.740 --> 19:07.740]  Nobody bought it.
[19:07.740 --> 19:10.780]  So it's going to be discontinued to make room for things that maybe somebody will be interested
[19:11.540 --> 19:12.700]  in. Also make room for new art.
[19:12.700 --> 19:15.940]  I'm kind of I think being a breeder, I'm kind of an artist, I guess you might want to call
[19:15.940 --> 19:16.940]  me that.
[19:16.940 --> 19:19.420]  I need to get rid of that old artwork and work on a new project.
[19:19.420 --> 19:23.140]  So the Stardog will go bye bye so that we can work on new things.
[19:23.140 --> 19:24.420]  Nothing against it.
[19:24.420 --> 19:25.420]  It's a great plant.
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.420]  I bred to it.
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.420]  I love it.
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.420]  I love the outcome.
[19:28.420 --> 19:31.980]  But I don't need to make more Stardog crosses when there are plenty of breeders out there
[19:31.980 --> 19:34.020]  making plenty of Stardog crosses.
[19:34.020 --> 19:36.540]  The guy that made Stardog has plenty of out crosses.
[19:36.540 --> 19:38.300]  I'll let him have his plant.
[19:38.300 --> 19:39.300]  Just respect.
[19:39.300 --> 19:40.300]  Do your thing, bro.
[19:41.300 --> 19:42.300]  Where are we?
[19:42.300 --> 19:43.420]  It's too much like Stardog.
[19:43.420 --> 19:45.660]  The flavors, gas, strawberries.
[19:45.660 --> 19:47.100]  I wrote down feet.
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.980]  Some of the phenotypes smell like feet.
[19:48.980 --> 19:50.900]  Some of them get that rubber tire smell.
[19:50.900 --> 19:56.660]  A lot of people say that Chemdog dominant crosses have a tire shop sort of a smell.
[19:56.660 --> 19:58.580]  I don't know how many hours you spent the tire shop.
[19:58.580 --> 20:00.940]  But the next time you go, your tires change.
[20:00.940 --> 20:02.980]  Think about what those tires smell like.
[20:02.980 --> 20:07.900]  Also, sometimes it smells like new generic shoes, not good shoes, but like good cheap
[20:07.900 --> 20:08.900]  shoes.
[20:09.140 --> 20:11.140]  Good new cheap shoes.
[20:11.140 --> 20:12.580]  Some of them smell like fresh tennis balls.
[20:12.580 --> 20:15.180]  I don't know if you've ever opened a can of tennis balls and smelled that weird smell
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.180]  that comes out of there.
[20:16.180 --> 20:18.580]  It's kind of a rubbery chemical sort of a smell.
[20:18.580 --> 20:22.100]  But some of the phenotypes will have that aroma to them.
[20:22.100 --> 20:25.380]  Now let's talk about the buzz that comes from Starstruck.
[20:25.380 --> 20:28.180]  I talked earlier how I love the buzz from Starstruck.
[20:28.180 --> 20:29.180]  I feel it.
[20:29.180 --> 20:32.260]  If I take a dab from Starstruck, I feel my eyes just go.
[20:32.260 --> 20:34.540]  It's like somebody just pushed a button to close the garage door.
[20:34.540 --> 20:36.020]  My eyes get real heavy.
[20:36.020 --> 20:37.220]  They get real bright red.
[20:37.500 --> 20:38.900]  I get a nice buzz from it.
[20:38.900 --> 20:40.060]  I get stoned.
[20:40.060 --> 20:41.060]  I get high.
[20:41.060 --> 20:42.620]  I get like, I don't know, it does something.
[20:42.620 --> 20:44.580]  A lot of concentrates make me normal.
[20:44.580 --> 20:46.060]  This one doesn't make me normal.
[20:46.060 --> 20:47.060]  It fucks me up.
[20:47.060 --> 20:48.380]  And that's what I'm looking for.
[20:48.380 --> 20:49.380]  It'll give me the giggles.
[20:49.380 --> 20:51.740]  I can get that weird grin.
[20:51.740 --> 20:53.660]  People that have been smoking a long time, it takes you a minute.
[20:53.660 --> 20:56.620]  But once you get there, you get that fucking silly grin on your face.
[20:56.620 --> 21:01.100]  Stardog will give me that stupid grin, that stoned grin that like, what are you thinking
[21:01.100 --> 21:02.100]  about, bro?
[21:02.100 --> 21:03.100]  I don't even know.
[21:03.100 --> 21:04.100]  But I'm just fucking smiling, dude.
[21:04.100 --> 21:06.460]  I'm just stoned and it's good.
[21:06.460 --> 21:10.860]  I've noticed if I smoke too many dabs of the Starstruck, I can time travel.
[21:10.860 --> 21:15.540]  I can get into a little bubble and I can come out of that bubble and it's been the full
[21:15.540 --> 21:16.540]  day.
[21:16.540 --> 21:20.420]  But also in that little bubble, I may have like completely rearranged the house.
[21:20.420 --> 21:23.020]  I don't know how well I rearranged it, but I did it.
[21:23.020 --> 21:24.120]  Completely rearranged the house.
[21:24.120 --> 21:26.040]  Maybe I organized all my seed packages.
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.420]  Maybe I tuned up the whole drum set.
[21:27.420 --> 21:33.100]  But it really, it can put you into a huge bubble if you smoke too much of the Starstruck.
[21:33.100 --> 21:35.660]  So now let's talk more about the growth characteristics.
[21:35.860 --> 21:37.380]  We've talked about consuming it.
[21:37.380 --> 21:38.820]  Let's talk about growing this plant.
[21:38.820 --> 21:43.260]  This is the part where all the growers are going to want to pay attention.
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.800]  Starstruck can take heavy feeds.
[21:45.800 --> 21:47.300]  She likes to be fed a lot.
[21:47.300 --> 21:52.460]  All of the plants in this cross are very heavy feeders, so she can take a lot of food.
[21:52.460 --> 21:55.740]  Later in flower, she will want extra cow mag.
[21:55.740 --> 21:59.980]  She takes topping, popping, twisting, and abuse very well.
[21:59.980 --> 22:04.620]  If you want to twist her, pop her, hold her down, put it in a screen, put it in a tomato
[22:04.620 --> 22:08.100]  cage, anything like that, it will take all of that very well.
[22:08.100 --> 22:10.180]  Also this plant clones very well.
[22:10.180 --> 22:14.660]  I've noticed that most of the time the Starstruck clones root a little more quickly than some
[22:14.660 --> 22:15.860]  of the other clones.
[22:15.860 --> 22:17.740]  It is very PM resistant.
[22:17.740 --> 22:19.840]  It is also resistant to bugs.
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.960]  It will take a lot of CO2.
[22:21.960 --> 22:24.980]  If you pump up the CO2, this plant will continue to grow.
[22:24.980 --> 22:28.340]  In a commercial environment, I really crank up the CO2.
[22:28.340 --> 22:31.240]  I'm not even going to tell you the numbers that I hit because some of the management
[22:31.240 --> 22:34.600]  may hear and they will not be happy at how much CO2 I'm cranking.
[22:34.600 --> 22:37.440]  We go fucking crazy and the Stardog plants love it.
[22:37.440 --> 22:39.880]  The Starstruck plants go fucking crazy.
[22:39.880 --> 22:44.420]  So Stardog, Starstruck loves the fucking CO2.
[22:44.420 --> 22:47.360]  They will get big buds that will need some help and some support.
[22:47.360 --> 22:50.560]  I say that about many of the crosses that I breed.
[22:50.560 --> 22:53.400]  Anything that comes from King Solomon is going to need support.
[22:53.400 --> 22:56.200]  If you think these plants will hold themselves up, you're crazy.
[22:56.200 --> 23:00.360]  It will need sticks, tomato cages, or trellis or something like that.
[23:00.360 --> 23:03.920]  You're going to get big fat buds from the Starstruck.
[23:03.920 --> 23:06.800]  Be prepared for that.
[23:06.800 --> 23:08.200]  These plants do stretch.
[23:08.200 --> 23:12.960]  I'm going to say expect double the height by the end of flower.
[23:12.960 --> 23:16.520]  Most of these plants are going to have that classic Christmas tree structure.
[23:16.520 --> 23:20.480]  Like I said earlier, some of the bottom branches are going to stretch out really horizontally
[23:20.480 --> 23:24.120]  and try to get away from the branches above them to where they can get more light.
[23:24.120 --> 23:25.760]  You may want to do some defoliation.
[23:25.760 --> 23:28.200]  These plants take very well to defoliation.
[23:28.200 --> 23:30.960]  Pull out those extra leaves, get that light down there.
[23:30.960 --> 23:32.880]  That'll help you minimize the stretch.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.760]  So crack, pop, and twist.
[23:34.760 --> 23:39.440]  The first two weeks of flower, that will definitely help slow down that aggressive stretching
[23:39.440 --> 23:41.680]  that you may see.
[23:41.680 --> 23:42.680]  They may double in height.
[23:42.680 --> 23:43.680]  I think I said that.
[23:43.680 --> 23:48.840]  They do like a pH somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4.
[23:48.840 --> 23:51.480]  They handle temperature swings very well.
[23:51.480 --> 23:53.600]  I've had this plant in a commercial environment.
[23:53.600 --> 23:57.920]  I've had the Starstruck and the Stardog both in commercial environments, and they both
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.540]  handle temperature swings very well.
[24:00.540 --> 24:03.900]  Of course, in a commercial environment, there are always equipment failures, and that's
[24:03.900 --> 24:08.060]  how you get to learn what good plants take the temperature problems, and that's how we
[24:08.060 --> 24:09.060]  learned it.
[24:09.060 --> 24:10.300]  So I've got good experience there.
[24:10.300 --> 24:12.700]  I know it will take temperature swings.
[24:12.700 --> 24:17.420]  Now let's talk about some of the phenotypes that you're going to find when you are growing
[24:17.420 --> 24:19.900]  Starstruck plants.
[24:19.900 --> 24:26.100]  Most of them, like I keep saying, they look mostly like Stardog.
[24:26.100 --> 24:28.380]  Not a super thick branch, not a really wispy branch.
[24:28.380 --> 24:31.660]  Like a medium-sized main apical meristem.
[24:31.660 --> 24:33.780]  Then we get long branching on the bottom.
[24:33.780 --> 24:35.820]  Then we get Christmas tree shape.
[24:35.820 --> 24:39.260]  Those bottom branches kind of just want to stretch out so they can get the light because
[24:39.260 --> 24:40.980]  they're being blocked from above.
[24:40.980 --> 24:44.060]  Instead of growing straight up, they grow completely horizontal.
[24:44.060 --> 24:47.100]  Then once they get past the branch above them, then they curve up.
[24:47.100 --> 24:51.540]  So they've got that classic Christmas tree shape to them.
[24:51.540 --> 24:56.540]  You will see some thin-leaved phreaks, and that is coming from the golden goat.
[24:56.540 --> 25:00.660]  That's probably from the island sweet skunk or the Hawaiian sativa.
[25:00.660 --> 25:02.420]  Those are not my favorite phenotypes.
[25:02.420 --> 25:04.060]  Those take a little bit longer.
[25:04.060 --> 25:06.300]  They don't have that gassy, funky flavor.
[25:06.300 --> 25:09.340]  They start getting a little bit more sweet flavor to it.
[25:09.340 --> 25:11.900]  But those do have more of a psychedelic head buzz.
[25:11.900 --> 25:16.220]  If you get those longer-lasting plants, those are more of a psychedelic head buzz, although
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.860]  they are not my favorite.
[25:17.860 --> 25:22.180]  If I'm growing Starstruck, I probably want the one that looks a little bit more like
[25:22.180 --> 25:23.180]  Stardog.
[25:23.180 --> 25:24.180]  It's got a whiter leaf.
[25:24.180 --> 25:25.180]  It almost looks like a maple leaf.
[25:25.180 --> 25:27.220]  It looks like the Canadian flag.
[25:27.220 --> 25:30.900]  That is the leaf I'm looking for when I'm growing Stardog or Starstruck.
[25:30.900 --> 25:33.300]  I want that Stardog-dominant phenotype.
[25:33.300 --> 25:37.220]  That is the commercial grower's dream.
[25:37.220 --> 25:39.500]  So those skinny leaves are going to be more sativa-dominant.
[25:39.500 --> 25:40.820]  They're going to take a little bit longer.
[25:40.820 --> 25:44.140]  They're definitely going to get stretchier and get much taller.
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.700]  I don't keep those around.
[25:45.700 --> 25:49.740]  If you choose to keep that, grow the shit out of it, let it go about 10 weeks, you will
[25:49.740 --> 25:50.740]  enjoy it.
[25:50.740 --> 25:52.780]  But I prefer the bigger-leaved phenotype.
[25:52.940 --> 25:53.940]  Defoliate.
[25:53.940 --> 25:58.700]  If you get these bigger-leaved phenotypes, you're going to have to defoliate and control
[25:58.700 --> 25:59.700]  the canopy.
[25:59.700 --> 26:02.100]  They will get large leaves that will block the light.
[26:02.100 --> 26:03.100]  Pull that off there.
[26:03.100 --> 26:06.460]  If you start seeing purple petioles, get that leaf off of there.
[26:06.460 --> 26:08.740]  It's not a problem if you get the purple petioles.
[26:08.740 --> 26:12.900]  Also, some of the phenotypes will get really large leaves that just droop.
[26:12.900 --> 26:16.900]  They won't go up no matter how much you water that plant, no matter how much light you give
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.900]  it.
[26:17.900 --> 26:20.220]  Some of those big, super big leaves are going to droop.
[26:20.220 --> 26:22.060]  That is a trait that comes from Daybreaker.
[26:22.060 --> 26:23.060]  That is not a problem.
[26:23.060 --> 26:24.740]  You're not doing anything wrong.
[26:24.740 --> 26:28.740]  The Daybreaker makes giant leaves and some of the phenotypes, they just hang down.
[26:28.740 --> 26:30.060]  They don't want to go up.
[26:30.060 --> 26:32.580]  They're so big that they can't support themselves.
[26:32.580 --> 26:34.240]  You're not doing anything wrong.
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.380]  That is just the plant.
[26:35.380 --> 26:37.980]  You can defoliate those if they are in the way.
[26:37.980 --> 26:38.980]  They'll get huge.
[26:38.980 --> 26:40.540]  Take some pictures.
[26:40.540 --> 26:43.420]  Some of these plants are going to get stinky really early.
[26:43.420 --> 26:48.220]  The ones that start putting off a watermelon turb early, that will turn into fuel and feet
[26:48.220 --> 26:49.340]  later on.
[26:49.340 --> 26:50.860]  That is a good sign.
[26:50.860 --> 26:52.660]  She goes fast, so be ready.
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.100]  You may need to flip early.
[26:54.100 --> 26:57.740]  You may need to flower a week earlier than you do with most of your plants.
[26:57.740 --> 27:02.140]  If you're not taking out that main apical top, these plants are going to get tall, maybe
[27:02.140 --> 27:04.260]  flower a little bit earlier.
[27:04.260 --> 27:07.060]  Now let's talk about flowering times.
[27:07.060 --> 27:09.580]  Most of the phenotypes are going to flower in nine weeks.
[27:09.580 --> 27:12.540]  You will find 10-week phenotypes.
[27:12.540 --> 27:15.260]  I like the 63-65 day phenotype.
[27:15.260 --> 27:17.540]  It is perfect for a commercial environment.
[27:17.540 --> 27:19.940]  That 10-weeker will get tall on you.
[27:20.060 --> 27:23.220]  You may see some more dense, tighter buds.
[27:23.220 --> 27:27.700]  That is the star-struck, star-dog dominant phenotype that you want.
[27:27.700 --> 27:29.580]  You'll see some airier, fluffier buds.
[27:29.580 --> 27:33.380]  That is the one I don't keep, but that is also the one that's going to give you that
[27:33.380 --> 27:34.940]  psychedelic head buzz.
[27:34.940 --> 27:38.180]  The tighter bud plant will probably go about nine weeks.
[27:38.180 --> 27:39.340]  Some will go 10.
[27:39.340 --> 27:43.900]  That airier, fluffier one, the stretchy one, that little bitch can go 10 or 11 weeks.
[27:43.900 --> 27:46.580]  I've never let it go longer because I don't like it.
[27:46.580 --> 27:47.580]  I cut it down.
[27:47.580 --> 27:48.580]  I get rid of it.
[27:48.620 --> 27:52.380]  That is not what I wanted from this project, so it just gets removed from the room.
[27:52.380 --> 27:53.380]  Not my favorite.
[27:53.380 --> 27:57.460]  If I wanted to grow a golden goat dominant plant, I would grow golden goat.
[27:57.460 --> 27:59.500]  I remove that little bitch from the room.
[27:59.500 --> 28:06.340]  Now, I've said it before, this seed line is discontinued.
[28:06.340 --> 28:09.420]  Don't be afraid to pick up seeds just because I don't make them anymore.
[28:09.420 --> 28:12.780]  I said that I don't make it because the first fact is nobody is buying it.
[28:12.780 --> 28:15.180]  I can't make seeds that aren't going to sell.
[28:15.180 --> 28:19.740]  First of all, there is somebody making plenty of Stardog crosses.
[28:19.740 --> 28:24.500]  If you want something that is a Stardog cross, cross to a rise, that has got the potential
[28:24.500 --> 28:31.580]  for really impressive THC numbers, I can almost promise you that you will find a 32 or higher
[28:31.580 --> 28:36.860]  percent THC plant in these seeds if you search through it, if you've got access to a lab,
[28:36.860 --> 28:40.980]  if you grow properly, if you give these things all of the love and care they deserve, you'll
[28:40.980 --> 28:45.140]  get 32% THC out of a phenotype of starstruck.
[28:45.140 --> 28:48.380]  I've seen that and higher from Stardog.
[28:48.380 --> 28:50.220]  I've seen that and higher from a rise.
[28:50.220 --> 28:52.240]  I know together they will beat that.
[28:52.240 --> 28:54.060]  I want to see your lab test.
[28:54.060 --> 28:57.220]  So I think that's all I've got for you guys when it comes to starstruck.
[28:57.220 --> 28:59.260]  It's a wonderful cross.
[28:59.260 --> 29:01.460]  I keep saying that it's great for commercial production.
[29:01.460 --> 29:05.140]  If you've got a commercial grow and you want to put some iRegenetics in there, I would
[29:05.140 --> 29:09.620]  put some starstruck and some strawberry starburst in there and you would have two wonderful
[29:09.620 --> 29:13.260]  flavors and aromas and you would kick ass and reach your goals.
[29:13.260 --> 29:16.340]  We could figure out a third strain and see what fits your palate and your customers'
[29:16.340 --> 29:18.900]  desires and we'll get your grow all loaded up.
[29:18.900 --> 29:23.580]  If you're a private grower, you want something that grows giant buds, you love that gassy,
[29:23.580 --> 29:29.580]  funky watermelon strawberry aroma, starstruck may be the plant for you.
[29:29.580 --> 29:34.300]  You guys, I am pretty sure that starstruck seeds are available at seedsherenow.com.
[29:34.300 --> 29:42.380]  Make sure you use coupon code GFYH10 and you can save yourself 10% off at seedsherenow.com.
[29:42.500 --> 29:44.900]  I think that is all I've got for you for the starstruck review.
[29:44.900 --> 29:48.780]  If I left anything out, if you've got any specific questions, please send me an email.
[29:48.780 --> 29:52.420]  Again, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:52.420 --> 29:56.980]  I look forward to your questions and I will try my best to do an update if I get enough
[29:56.980 --> 29:57.980]  questions.
[29:57.980 --> 30:01.500]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[30:01.500 --> 30:06.940]  and growers, seed hoarders, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, I don't know who else there
[30:06.940 --> 30:07.940]  is.
[30:07.940 --> 30:08.940]  What else we got out there?
[30:08.940 --> 30:10.700]  Oh, we got light makers, we got trimmers.
