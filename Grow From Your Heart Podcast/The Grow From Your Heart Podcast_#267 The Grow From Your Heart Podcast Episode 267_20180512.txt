[00:00.190 --> 00:12.190]  Hey everyone, this is Dab and Branny and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:12.190 --> 00:15.190]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:15.190 --> 00:21.190]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.190 --> 00:23.190]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.190 --> 00:24.190]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.190 --> 00:26.190]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.190 --> 00:27.190]  Before you going back.
[00:27.190 --> 00:28.190]  Way back.
[00:28.190 --> 00:31.190]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.190 --> 00:32.190]  Hit it.
[00:33.190 --> 00:34.190]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.190 --> 00:40.190]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:40.190 --> 00:43.190]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.190 --> 00:49.190]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.190 --> 00:54.190]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.190 --> 00:56.190]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[00:56.190 --> 01:01.190]  And with no further ado, here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:02.190 --> 01:21.480]  Cannabis community, it's time for episode number 148 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.480 --> 01:25.480]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.480]  So if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.480]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:33.480 --> 01:36.480]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.480 --> 01:39.480]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.480 --> 01:41.480]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.480 --> 01:44.480]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:44.480 --> 01:46.480]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:46.480 --> 01:50.480]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:51.480 --> 01:52.480]  I hope everybody's having a great week.
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode features myself and our buddy White Mike.
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.480]  Make sure you follow White Mike's Facebook page, Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.480]  Make sure you support all the sensible cannabis laws.
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.480]  You guys, I don't want to do too long of an intro.
[02:04.480 --> 02:05.480]  I'm just going to let the music play.
[02:05.480 --> 02:08.480]  And when I get right back, I'll be joined by our good friend White Mike.
[02:08.480 --> 02:09.480]  Hang out.
[02:20.570 --> 02:23.570]  I think that's how the podcast is going to start is with a big fat fuck blue dream.
[02:24.570 --> 02:26.570]  So you guys, we are back.
[02:26.570 --> 02:27.570]  We're here.
[02:27.570 --> 02:28.570]  It's going to say the studio.
[02:28.570 --> 02:30.570]  Is this can this officially be a studio?
[02:30.570 --> 02:33.570]  I think when all the gears that we can call it a studio, I think that's fair.
[02:33.570 --> 02:35.570]  So today we've got the pocket studio.
[02:35.570 --> 02:37.570]  We're recording on the we are recording.
[02:37.570 --> 02:38.570]  My mouth is fucking high.
[02:38.570 --> 02:39.570]  My brain's not as high as my mouth.
[02:39.570 --> 02:42.570]  I think we're recording on the Zoom H6 handy recorder.
[02:42.570 --> 02:44.570]  You guys, I'm doing a little test run.
[02:44.570 --> 02:48.570]  I want to make sure that I've got this figured out because I'm going to go record with dad and granny again.
[02:48.570 --> 02:52.570]  So here on the podcast with me in the makeshift pocket studio is our buddy White Mike.
[02:52.570 --> 02:53.570]  Welcome back, bro.
[02:53.570 --> 02:54.570]  Thanks, man.
[02:55.570 --> 02:56.570]  Let's do this part that I always like to do.
[02:56.570 --> 03:01.570]  Tell everybody that's listening where they can stalk you on social media so that they can check you out while they're listening.
[03:02.570 --> 03:07.570]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook and at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[03:08.570 --> 03:10.570]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[03:10.570 --> 03:13.570]  What kind of stuff are we going to see if we go to the Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws Facebook page?
[03:14.570 --> 03:20.570]  Pretty much any marijuana news related event I can find that's even remotely relevant to the US gets linked up there.
[03:21.570 --> 03:23.570]  I appreciate what you do for the cannabis industry and for the cannabis community.
[03:24.570 --> 03:25.570]  Thank you, man.
[03:25.570 --> 03:28.570]  I'm not I'm a working man and I'm always at a grow.
[03:28.570 --> 03:33.570]  Anybody that listens to the podcast regularly knows that I am the lead cultivator of a hundred light facility.
[03:34.570 --> 03:35.570]  So that keeps me busy.
[03:35.570 --> 03:36.570]  I've got a day job.
[03:36.570 --> 03:39.570]  Most of the politics happens during the day.
[03:40.570 --> 03:47.570]  So when there's politicking to be done, when there's people have to go to city council meetings and speak and show support when that stuff is to be done.
[03:48.570 --> 03:51.570]  Mike is the guy that goes and does that in my my place because I am stuck at the grow.
[03:52.570 --> 03:53.570]  So thanks for doing that kind of stuff.
[03:54.570 --> 03:56.570]  Thanks for having a Facebook page to keep our community together.
[03:57.570 --> 04:03.570]  Thanks to all the people that help with Mike Mike's organizations and all the people that join up with Mike to go to all these rallies to go protest things.
[04:04.570 --> 04:05.570]  Big shout out to all those people.
[04:05.570 --> 04:08.570]  If there are a couple of pro what's the word activists in town?
[04:08.570 --> 04:09.570]  I couldn't think of the word act.
[04:10.570 --> 04:11.570]  There are several now.
[04:11.570 --> 04:13.570]  It's kind of nice that I'm not totally alone anymore.
[04:14.570 --> 04:15.570]  Do you want to give two or three of them some shout outs?
[04:16.570 --> 04:17.570]  Anybody that may deserve a big fat thumbs up?
[04:18.570 --> 04:24.570]  Juicy J has been doing a lot of stuff on social media that I love.
[04:25.570 --> 04:31.570]  There's a guy named Brooks that's been doing a ton of stuff on social media right now.
[04:32.570 --> 04:36.570]  Lots of great infographic memes for our side and our fight down here.
[04:36.570 --> 04:39.570]  He's been doing some amazing work and I really appreciate it.
[04:40.570 --> 04:44.570]  Some of his work shared to my page has gotten record views and shares and stuff like that.
[04:45.570 --> 04:46.570]  So nice.
[04:46.570 --> 04:47.570]  Juicy J and Brooks.
[04:48.570 --> 04:49.570]  Yep.
[04:49.570 --> 04:50.570]  Those two.
[04:50.570 --> 04:51.570]  Thanks for supporting the cannabis community.
[04:52.570 --> 04:53.570]  You guys we need people like you on the team.
[04:54.570 --> 04:55.570]  Mike dude.
[04:55.570 --> 04:56.570]  Awesome.
[04:56.570 --> 04:58.570]  You showed up with this orange flavor.
[04:59.570 --> 05:00.570]  Citrusy grapefruit hash.
[05:01.570 --> 05:02.570]  Tell me a little more about that.
[05:03.570 --> 05:05.570]  Lemon thyme sugar wax from Rock and Expo.
[05:06.570 --> 05:07.570]  It's a new Pueblo company.
[05:08.570 --> 05:09.570]  I really like it.
[05:10.570 --> 05:16.570]  I took it to just do something fun to take along with me to a meeting of several dab kids is the wrong term.
[05:17.570 --> 05:18.570]  But it's the closest one we got I guess.
[05:19.570 --> 05:22.570]  But several folks getting together dabbing and it ended up being the talk of the table.
[05:23.570 --> 05:29.570]  Which I thought was funny because we were dabbing raw turps on distillate that night too.
[05:30.570 --> 05:32.570]  Is this a, sorry about the fucked up throw you guys.
[05:33.570 --> 05:34.570]  We've been taking dabs like we're talking about.
[05:34.570 --> 05:36.570]  Is this a live resin or is this a fresh frozen product?
[05:37.570 --> 05:38.570]  How much do you know about that?
[05:39.570 --> 05:41.570]  I'm actually not sure on that particular step.
[05:42.570 --> 05:49.570]  The big part or the big pitch of this company is it's a proprietary mixed gas extraction.
[05:50.570 --> 05:51.570]  That explains a lot to me.
[05:52.570 --> 05:55.570]  Somebody that knows a lot, not a lot, but that smokes a lot of different types of concentrates.
[05:56.570 --> 05:58.570]  I can tell that this, that's why I asked if it was live resin.
[05:59.570 --> 06:00.570]  Because of the color and texture.
[06:00.570 --> 06:06.570]  The color and texture are not what I'm used to seeing from a butane extraction unless it's live resin.
[06:07.570 --> 06:09.570]  But that is very, very close to what I see.
[06:10.570 --> 06:11.570]  What would you call that color?
[06:12.570 --> 06:14.570]  Man, I don't know what color that is.
[06:15.570 --> 06:16.570]  Butterscotch.
[06:17.570 --> 06:18.570]  It's a butterscotch color. That's a really good description of it.
[06:19.570 --> 06:20.570]  It's not orange, it's not yellow.
[06:21.570 --> 06:26.570]  And when it was fresh it had a little more orange, yellowish pop to it.
[06:27.570 --> 06:28.570]  Okay.
[06:28.570 --> 06:30.570]  It's a propane butane mix.
[06:31.570 --> 06:32.570]  I can see the propane happening there.
[06:33.570 --> 06:35.570]  This is legitimately the first propane hash I've ever dabbed.
[06:36.570 --> 06:42.570]  I've seen it made. There's a great Vice Media documentary where they go and interview a guy building a propane extraction rig.
[06:43.570 --> 06:47.570]  And the hash that comes out of that is frighteningly orange, like cheese and orange.
[06:48.570 --> 06:53.570]  Okay, wow. I've smoked a bunch of propane hash oil from our friends at Altitude Organic Medicine.
[06:54.570 --> 06:55.570]  Excuse me for that, you guys.
[06:55.570 --> 07:00.570]  I've smoked a bunch of propane hash from Altitude and it's always white, like completely white.
[07:01.570 --> 07:03.570]  And it's real, it's kind of mushy and it always tastes really good.
[07:04.570 --> 07:07.570]  What I don't like about it is it kind of makes my lungs feel sort of heavy.
[07:08.570 --> 07:09.570]  It gives me a butter lung sort of feeling.
[07:10.570 --> 07:13.570]  I over-dabbed myself with some of this one night.
[07:14.570 --> 07:19.570]  I way overheated my banger and took an insanely hot dab, just not paying attention.
[07:20.570 --> 07:24.570]  The last one I'd taken a little cool, so I was a little, you know, Johnny on the spot.
[07:25.570 --> 07:26.570]  I was taking that dab.
[07:27.570 --> 07:30.570]  And while I was coughing, the cough seemed to go on quite a while.
[07:31.570 --> 07:33.570]  And for a minute I considered, is it the mixed gas?
[07:34.570 --> 07:38.570]  But from everything I've seen, all the lab testing, it's totally clean.
[07:39.570 --> 07:43.570]  Okay. Well, we talked about lipids and plant fats and all that kind of stuff on an episode previous.
[07:44.570 --> 07:49.570]  So I wonder if there are plant paraffins and lipids and stuff like that left behind in there that they're not taken out.
[07:50.570 --> 07:52.570]  Either way, it's marvelous hash is what I wanted to get to.
[07:53.570 --> 07:54.570]  The flavor is insane.
[07:55.570 --> 07:57.570]  It was like, at first it was like orangey.
[07:58.570 --> 08:00.570]  And then I waited a few minutes and as my mouth dried up, it turned to grapefruits.
[08:01.570 --> 08:02.570]  Just straight up grapefruits on my tongue.
[08:03.570 --> 08:05.570]  It was really delicious. I didn't want to take a drink for a while, but I had to because I was coughing and dying.
[08:06.570 --> 08:07.570]  I've still got the grapefruit coating now. It's really nice.
[08:08.570 --> 08:09.570]  Nice. Good job on bringing the good hash.
[08:10.570 --> 08:11.570]  Big shout out to Rockin' Extracts.
[08:12.570 --> 08:13.570]  You said they're a Pueblo company?
[08:14.570 --> 08:16.570]  Yeah, they're right up the street from the shop.
[08:17.570 --> 08:18.570]  That's pretty cool.
[08:19.570 --> 08:20.570]  Yeah, they're good guys.
[08:21.570 --> 08:23.570]  They make several different products that I've enjoyed.
[08:23.570 --> 08:24.570]  Their deliveries better always be on time.
[08:25.570 --> 08:27.570]  Yeah, they walk them over. It's cute.
[08:28.570 --> 08:32.570]  Can you do that legally with the manifest? Can you walk over a product?
[08:33.570 --> 08:34.570]  Yep.
[08:35.570 --> 08:38.570]  They make a couple different products that I'm enjoying right now.
[08:39.570 --> 08:42.570]  They've also got the first vape pen cartridge I've actually not felt bad about spending money on.
[08:43.570 --> 08:46.570]  Nice. Does it come in flavors or is it just one flavor?
[08:47.570 --> 08:49.570]  Right now it's just a single extract run.
[08:50.570 --> 08:52.570]  It's a mixed batch, no strain specific.
[08:53.570 --> 08:54.570]  It's a Diva or Indica?
[08:55.570 --> 08:56.570]  A hybrid blend.
[08:57.570 --> 08:59.570]  Of course. That means they just threw a bunch of shit together.
[09:00.570 --> 09:02.570]  I have a feeling it's half Clementine, half Blue Dream.
[09:03.570 --> 09:04.570]  Is honestly what I think it is.
[09:05.570 --> 09:06.570]  Fuck Blue Dream.
[09:07.570 --> 09:09.570]  But yeah, I've been enjoying the hell out of this Sugar Wax.
[09:10.570 --> 09:12.570]  Super tasty hash. High quality. I'm high as shit.
[09:13.570 --> 09:15.570]  When you guys go into your local weed store, if that's a thing where you are,
[09:16.570 --> 09:18.570]  ask them what new stuff is in and check out new stuff.
[09:19.570 --> 09:20.570]  Don't get set in a total routine.
[09:20.570 --> 09:22.570]  There's a lot of new cool stuff coming out you should check out. What's new?
[09:23.570 --> 09:24.570]  I kind of stepped out of my little box.
[09:25.570 --> 09:26.570]  I was really familiar with Turpex.
[09:27.570 --> 09:28.570]  I mean I grow the product at Green and Healthy.
[09:29.570 --> 09:31.570]  We take it to Turpex. They turn it into concentrates for us.
[09:32.570 --> 09:33.570]  Why wouldn't I buy that? You know what I mean?
[09:34.570 --> 09:36.570]  But lately I've been buying the Kraft Extracts.
[09:37.570 --> 09:38.570]  The Kraft makes really good products.
[09:39.570 --> 09:40.570]  I've been getting Extracts Inc.
[09:41.570 --> 09:42.570]  I think that's what they're called. Extracts Inc.
[09:43.570 --> 09:44.570]  Yeah, they make really good products.
[09:45.570 --> 09:47.570]  I had some Darth Cookies the other day. It was really tasty stuff.
[09:47.570 --> 09:49.570]  I've been stepping out of my normal 710 Labs.
[09:50.570 --> 09:51.570]  Really good shit. Viola.
[09:52.570 --> 09:53.570]  If you get the right batch of Viola, it'll taste really good.
[09:54.570 --> 09:55.570]  Yeah, check out new shit.
[09:56.570 --> 09:57.570]  Don't be afraid to try new stuff.
[09:58.570 --> 09:59.570]  You're going to get a quality product.
[10:00.570 --> 10:02.570]  I've spent a lot of time going through the edible section,
[10:03.570 --> 10:04.570]  making sure I tried kind of one of everything.
[10:05.570 --> 10:07.570]  And I'm doing the same thing with the hash lately.
[10:08.570 --> 10:09.570]  It's a lot of fun.
[10:10.570 --> 10:11.570]  It's fun watching you step up your hash game.
[10:12.570 --> 10:14.570]  It's so expensive piece by piece, but I'm loving it.
[10:14.570 --> 10:17.570]  You started off, I think I gave you your first dab probably.
[10:18.570 --> 10:19.570]  I would assume.
[10:20.570 --> 10:21.570]  Yeah, it was downstairs on the swing arm skillet.
[10:22.570 --> 10:23.570]  Oh gosh.
[10:24.570 --> 10:25.570]  The hot oil days.
[10:26.570 --> 10:27.570]  The syringe of black CO2 oil on the dabber.
[10:28.570 --> 10:29.570]  On the dental pick dabber days.
[10:30.570 --> 10:32.570]  Oh, those days when they were selling us dental pick dabbers
[10:33.570 --> 10:34.570]  at the events for the price of dab tools
[10:35.570 --> 10:36.570]  and they were just old dental dabbers from Pakistan.
[10:37.570 --> 10:38.570]  Yep.
[10:39.570 --> 10:40.570]  But it's good to see you've stepped up.
[10:41.570 --> 10:42.570]  You went from taking little tiny dabs of just boo-boo
[10:42.570 --> 10:43.570]  to now you take pretty good sized dabs
[10:44.570 --> 10:45.570]  of some Clementine sugar wax, bro.
[10:46.570 --> 10:47.570]  Right. It's nice.
[10:48.570 --> 10:49.570]  I got you a decent sized dab of some pineapple jack
[10:50.570 --> 10:51.570]  set up there.
[10:52.570 --> 10:53.570]  That's going to make you cough pretty good.
[10:54.570 --> 10:55.570]  The last pineapple jack.
[10:56.570 --> 10:57.570]  Which company made this?
[10:58.570 --> 10:59.570]  Was it Terp?
[11:00.570 --> 11:01.570]  Yeah, this is from the TerpX.
[11:02.570 --> 11:03.570]  The shop got in a shipment of that a long time ago
[11:04.570 --> 11:05.570]  and I ended up with like eight of them at home
[11:06.570 --> 11:07.570]  by the time we sold out.
[11:08.570 --> 11:09.570]  I had a back stash.
[11:10.570 --> 11:11.570]  I probably grew that.
[11:12.570 --> 11:13.570]  Very, very well.
[11:14.570 --> 11:15.570]  It's actually New York pineapple diesel
[11:16.570 --> 11:17.570]  is what it would be.
[11:18.570 --> 11:19.570]  It's a pineapple diesel cross on accident, I think.
[11:20.570 --> 11:21.570]  But there were a bunch of seeds
[11:22.570 --> 11:23.570]  and that's what came out as that phenotype
[11:24.570 --> 11:25.570]  and it grows like a fucking savage.
[11:26.570 --> 11:27.570]  Super sweet.
[11:28.570 --> 11:29.570]  It's a great plant.
[11:30.570 --> 11:31.570]  So we've been talking for quite a while here.
[11:32.570 --> 11:33.570]  I don't think we've gotten into any sort of topic.
[11:34.570 --> 11:35.570]  Well, I take this dab.
[11:36.570 --> 11:37.570]  You let the listeners know what the topic is.
[11:38.570 --> 11:39.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:40.570 --> 11:41.570]  Well, the first stop, I'm going to read a couple of email.
[11:42.570 --> 11:43.570]  I'm going to read a couple of emails
[11:44.570 --> 11:45.570]  that I got from the audience on there.
[11:46.570 --> 11:47.570]  I wanted to remind everybody that I did promise everybody
[11:48.570 --> 11:49.570]  a podcast about the dab and granny
[11:50.570 --> 11:51.570]  or featuring the dab and granny.
[11:52.570 --> 11:53.570]  I recorded that podcast at the Cana Canyon
[11:54.570 --> 11:55.570]  and unfortunately I got home
[11:56.570 --> 11:57.570]  and my memory card would not let me pull the files.
[11:58.570 --> 11:59.570]  It would let me drag the files
[12:00.570 --> 12:01.570]  from the memory card to my desktop,
[12:02.570 --> 12:03.570]  but they will not play.
[12:04.570 --> 12:05.570]  They won't play from the memory card.
[12:06.570 --> 12:07.570]  They won't play from the desktop.
[12:08.570 --> 12:09.570]  I even took the Zoom H6 and ran the USB cable
[12:10.570 --> 12:11.570]  to the computer and tried to open the files that way
[12:12.570 --> 12:13.570]  and so far with my tech skills,
[12:14.570 --> 12:15.570]  that show is lost.
[12:16.570 --> 12:17.570]  So what I've done is I set up another show.
[12:18.570 --> 12:19.570]  I'm not going to tell you when
[12:20.570 --> 12:21.570]  because you might show up.
[12:22.570 --> 12:23.570]  That's creepy, but in the future,
[12:24.570 --> 12:25.570]  dab and granny, myself, Brett, Lindsay,
[12:26.570 --> 12:27.570]  and maybe a couple of the folks
[12:28.570 --> 12:29.570]  are going to congregate at the Cana Canyon.
[12:30.570 --> 12:31.570]  Mike is going to cough his face off.
[12:32.570 --> 12:33.570]  Hang out, bro.
[12:34.570 --> 12:35.570]  You don't have to run.
[12:36.570 --> 12:37.570]  Do it.
[12:38.570 --> 12:39.570]  We'll leave your mic on and everything.
[12:40.570 --> 12:41.570]  He's purple.
[12:42.570 --> 12:43.570]  He's going to cough his face off
[12:44.570 --> 12:45.570]  in the very near future.
[12:46.570 --> 12:47.570]  We're going to read that email.
[12:48.570 --> 12:49.570]  I said that the one thing I wanted
[12:50.570 --> 12:51.570]  to talk about with Mike, the main thing,
[12:52.570 --> 12:53.570]  because Mike is our smart friend
[12:54.570 --> 12:55.570]  that comes over with smart shit.
[12:56.570 --> 12:57.570]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[12:58.570 --> 12:59.570]  the DEA has failed to reschedule cannabis.
[13:00.570 --> 13:01.570]  Cannabis is still considered a Schedule 1 drug,
[13:02.570 --> 13:03.570]  which let me tell you what that means.
[13:04.570 --> 13:05.570]  Schedule 1 drugs are the most dangerous drugs
[13:06.570 --> 13:07.570]  with the most potential for abuse
[13:08.570 --> 13:09.570]  and psychological dependence.
[13:10.570 --> 13:11.570]  So now cannabis still is in the same category
[13:12.570 --> 13:13.570]  as LSD, as heroin, and ecstasy.
[13:14.570 --> 13:15.570]  There is no medicinal value.
[13:16.570 --> 13:17.570]  Mike, how do you feel about that?
[13:18.570 --> 13:19.570]  I saw it coming a mile away,
[13:20.570 --> 13:21.570]  but I'm still a little disappointed.
[13:22.570 --> 13:23.570]  It's 2016.
[13:24.570 --> 13:25.570]  So about 90 days ago,
[13:26.570 --> 13:27.570]  the DEA said that they were
[13:28.570 --> 13:29.570]  considering rescheduling cannabis.
[13:30.570 --> 13:31.570]  They taunted everybody.
[13:32.570 --> 13:33.570]  They teased us.
[13:34.570 --> 13:35.570]  They made us all think that there may be a change.
[13:36.570 --> 13:37.570]  And then in 90 days, they just said,
[13:38.570 --> 13:39.570]  oh, never mind.
[13:40.570 --> 13:41.570]  Sorry, we're not going to do that.
[13:42.570 --> 13:43.570]  Cannabis is not big.
[13:44.570 --> 13:46.570]  It's just not as big as the media made it sound.
[13:47.570 --> 13:48.570]  They didn't reschedule cannabis,
[13:49.570 --> 13:52.570]  but they did open up more research,
[13:53.570 --> 13:55.570]  growth production sites for cannabis
[13:56.570 --> 13:59.570]  for pretty much everybody listening's whole lifetime.
[14:00.570 --> 14:01.570]  The feds have been growing marijuana
[14:02.570 --> 14:04.570]  for research purposes at the University of Mississippi.
[14:05.570 --> 14:07.570]  Sorry, I'm still dabbed out.
[14:08.570 --> 14:11.570]  But that's the only farm that grew it.
[14:12.570 --> 14:13.570]  We've been watching Sanjay Gupta's
[14:14.570 --> 14:16.570]  Weed 1, 2, and 3 specials on CNN.
[14:17.570 --> 14:21.570]  They covered the research restriction topic pretty well.
[14:22.570 --> 14:25.570]  Basically, there's only one farm growing research marijuana
[14:26.570 --> 14:29.570]  in the U.S., which means there's almost no variety
[14:30.570 --> 14:31.570]  of cannabis to research in the U.S.
[14:32.570 --> 14:33.570]  They've only got four strains
[14:34.570 --> 14:35.570]  or some really restricted number.
[14:36.570 --> 14:37.570]  Sorry, my lungs are still going a little nuts.
[14:38.570 --> 14:39.570]  You're good. We can hear it.
[14:40.570 --> 14:41.570]  But you're good. You're making enough sense to make it matter.
[14:42.570 --> 14:44.570]  Following along, I'm trying really hard
[14:45.570 --> 14:46.570]  not to cough and punch it right into the mic.
[14:47.570 --> 14:48.570]  He's doing really well, too.
[14:49.570 --> 14:50.570]  You should see the look on his face.
[14:51.570 --> 14:52.570]  I'll jump in for a second.
[14:53.570 --> 14:56.570]  You guys, I've seen the cannabis that they grow
[14:57.570 --> 14:59.570]  at that facility there in Mississippi, and it's garbage.
[15:00.570 --> 15:01.570]  They don't have a proper growth facility.
[15:02.570 --> 15:03.570]  They don't have proper technique.
[15:04.570 --> 15:05.570]  I don't think they have good genetics.
[15:06.570 --> 15:07.570]  I've seen what they're doing, and it's an embarrassing growth.
[15:08.570 --> 15:09.570]  If my growth looked like that, I would put matches to it.
[15:10.570 --> 15:11.570]  They should be ashamed of what they were producing
[15:12.570 --> 15:13.570]  when I saw the last footage in there.
[15:14.570 --> 15:16.570]  You can pull up some footage on YouTube,
[15:17.570 --> 15:18.570]  what a lot of it looks like.
[15:19.570 --> 15:20.570]  When you listen to the researchers talk,
[15:21.570 --> 15:23.570]  they tell you, we can produce anything that's requested.
[15:24.570 --> 15:30.570]  We can mix a batch of 19% THC or 10% or 4% or 12%,
[15:31.570 --> 15:32.570]  whatever you want.
[15:33.570 --> 15:34.570]  When you look at what he's talking about,
[15:35.570 --> 15:36.570]  he's basically like, we just grind up enough leaf and stem
[15:37.570 --> 15:38.570]  in there to bring the 21 down to 12
[15:38.570 --> 15:42.570]  or the grind enough bud over the 4% until it's a 9%.
[15:43.570 --> 15:44.570]  It's not pretty.
[15:45.570 --> 15:47.570]  I've seen their facility, and I don't think they ever pass 15%.
[15:48.570 --> 15:52.570]  The feds have run a medical marijuana program since 82,
[15:53.570 --> 15:55.570]  where patients get mailed 11 ounces each
[15:56.570 --> 15:58.570]  of pre-rolled joints every month.
[15:59.570 --> 16:00.570]  Like a coffee can?
[16:01.570 --> 16:02.570]  Yeah, in a really cool coffee tin.
[16:03.570 --> 16:05.570]  It's actually a bizarre collectible in the US now,
[16:06.570 --> 16:07.570]  because you can find them on eBay from time to time.
[16:08.570 --> 16:11.570]  One of the federal patients that does a lot of public speaking
[16:12.570 --> 16:16.570]  will give them away for charity events like silent auctions and stuff.
[16:17.570 --> 16:21.570]  The marijuana that those patients get is from this farm.
[16:22.570 --> 16:24.570]  Some of the video of it, especially,
[16:25.570 --> 16:27.570]  that was taken at conferences in the late 90s, early 1000s.
[16:28.570 --> 16:30.570]  The quality is just atrocious.
[16:31.570 --> 16:33.570]  They have to unroll the pre-rolled joints,
[16:34.570 --> 16:35.570]  rehydrated in the fridge,
[16:35.570 --> 16:38.570]  like old hippie style with a piece of lettuce or a piece of bread
[16:39.570 --> 16:41.570]  to bring the moisture content up real quick, and then re-roll it.
[16:42.570 --> 16:44.570]  It's like Mexican brick weed from America.
[16:45.570 --> 16:46.570]  Yep.
[16:47.570 --> 16:48.570]  They need to hire somebody.
[16:49.570 --> 16:50.570]  Hey, guys in Mississippi, hire me.
[16:51.570 --> 16:52.570]  I know how to grow cannabis.
[16:53.570 --> 16:54.570]  Let's do this.
[16:55.570 --> 16:56.570]  It's gotten a lot better since a lot of that footage was shot.
[16:57.570 --> 16:58.570]  I hope so.
[16:59.570 --> 17:00.570]  Did you see the CNN footage?
[17:01.570 --> 17:02.570]  Do you know it well enough to discuss quality from that?
[17:03.570 --> 17:04.570]  I think that's the footage that I saw.
[17:05.570 --> 17:07.570]  They have a shitty LED, and they've got a small hydro table,
[17:08.570 --> 17:09.570]  and the plants just look sad.
[17:10.570 --> 17:11.570]  The plants totally look sad.
[17:12.570 --> 17:16.570]  It's definitely not like Colorado commercial production quality.
[17:17.570 --> 17:18.570]  It's definitely not home-grown quality.
[17:19.570 --> 17:20.570]  Yeah.
[17:21.570 --> 17:22.570]  Remember the guy we went to his house,
[17:23.570 --> 17:24.570]  and he had those super stretchy plants with the UFO light above them?
[17:25.570 --> 17:26.570]  That's what it made me think of.
[17:27.570 --> 17:28.570]  You know who I'm talking about right away.
[17:29.570 --> 17:30.570]  It reminded me of that dude's grow.
[17:31.570 --> 17:32.570]  I was like, oh, that guy's growing over there.
[17:33.570 --> 17:34.570]  Shit.
[17:35.570 --> 17:36.570]  It's definitely not home-grown quality by the looks of it.
[17:37.570 --> 17:42.570]  The DEA claims that cannabis does not have a currently accepted medical use in the US,
[17:43.570 --> 17:46.570]  and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision,
[17:47.570 --> 17:49.570]  and it has a high potential for abuse.
[17:50.570 --> 17:51.570]  All of that is bullshit, you guys.
[17:52.570 --> 17:56.570]  Mike, why isn't the DEA smart enough to see that all of that is bullshit?
[17:57.570 --> 17:58.570]  Oh, they totally do.
[17:59.570 --> 18:00.570]  What's their motive?
[18:01.570 --> 18:04.570]  It doesn't have anything to do with marijuana itself.
[18:05.570 --> 18:09.570]  It has everything to do with seceding power, in my opinion.
[18:10.570 --> 18:13.570]  Marijuana being illegal is an amazingly powerful tool.
[18:14.570 --> 18:17.570]  It does several things that they want to keep happening.
[18:18.570 --> 18:20.570]  If they lose that stick, they lose a lot.
[18:21.570 --> 18:26.570]  There are a lot of things that are built on that pyramid they crumble after.
[18:27.570 --> 18:28.570]  Is it the pharmaceutical industry?
[18:29.570 --> 18:31.570]  There are definitely financial interests at stake.
[18:32.570 --> 18:33.570]  Is it the prison industry?
[18:33.570 --> 18:35.570]  There's been some good reporting lately.
[18:36.570 --> 18:42.570]  I don't remember which paper, but looking at the major lobbying efforts recently
[18:43.570 --> 18:45.570]  against marijuana rescheduling, against marijuana legalization,
[18:46.570 --> 18:48.570]  and a lot of that's coming from alcohol and pharmaceuticals.
[18:49.570 --> 18:51.570]  Alcohol, pharmaceutical, prisons. Okay.
[18:52.570 --> 18:55.570]  There's a big report out recently that legal marijuana states
[18:56.570 --> 19:00.570]  and medical marijuana states saw huge reductions in Medicare and Medicaid prescription billing.
[19:01.570 --> 19:02.570]  Oh, wow.
[19:03.570 --> 19:10.570]  It was in enough states and over the same timelines to draw causation conclusions.
[19:11.570 --> 19:16.570]  Not a one-to-one mathematical conclusion, but enough to infer that
[19:17.570 --> 19:20.570]  where people have easy, free, legal access to cannabis,
[19:21.570 --> 19:23.570]  they can just swing by a store and get it, basically.
[19:24.570 --> 19:27.570]  They consume significantly less prescription drugs,
[19:28.570 --> 19:30.570]  and that's a huge loss to a major industry.
[19:31.570 --> 19:32.570]  Same thing with alcohol.
[19:33.570 --> 19:37.570]  When 20-something males have marijuana that they can go buy at a store,
[19:38.570 --> 19:41.570]  they consume significantly less alcohol.
[19:42.570 --> 19:44.570]  Honestly, my mic sounded really hot. Sorry.
[19:45.570 --> 19:47.570]  Honestly, when I got my first medical marijuana card,
[19:48.570 --> 19:50.570]  I told myself and my friends and my family, I was like,
[19:51.570 --> 19:52.570]  you know what, I can smoke all the cannabis I want.
[19:53.570 --> 19:54.570]  I'm going to quit drinking.
[19:55.570 --> 19:56.570]  And they're like, bullshit.
[19:57.570 --> 19:59.570]  And here it is, probably six, seven, eight years maybe later,
[20:00.570 --> 20:01.570]  I haven't drank since I started using medical cannabis,
[20:01.570 --> 20:04.570]  since I was able to go to the dispensary and point at that jar and say,
[20:05.570 --> 20:07.570]  let me get an ounce of that tastiness right there,
[20:08.570 --> 20:10.570]  and go home and roll up and puff down as hard as I want without any worries.
[20:11.570 --> 20:13.570]  Because back in the day, I didn't know where I was going to buy my next weed.
[20:14.570 --> 20:15.570]  You have to preserve that ounce because you paid way too much,
[20:16.570 --> 20:18.570]  and you don't know if that dude's going to have good weed or not next time.
[20:19.570 --> 20:20.570]  Now you can medicate as needed.
[20:21.570 --> 20:22.570]  I don't need to drink any alcohol. I don't like being drunk.
[20:23.570 --> 20:25.570]  I'm no good. I don't know if I'm really good at it or really bad at it.
[20:26.570 --> 20:29.570]  I'm not sure what the case is, but I know that it's not my friend.
[20:29.570 --> 20:33.570]  I don't wake up hungover and regretful when I smoke cannabis.
[20:34.570 --> 20:36.570]  I've got a very similar story.
[20:37.570 --> 20:39.570]  I quit drinking before I had a medical marijuana card,
[20:40.570 --> 20:42.570]  but essentially the same thing is I got really good at drinking.
[20:43.570 --> 20:46.570]  And I decided that I didn't like some of those character traits,
[20:47.570 --> 20:48.570]  so I was going to take a couple of days off.
[20:49.570 --> 20:52.570]  A couple of days became a week, and now it's been like eight years.
[20:53.570 --> 20:58.570]  I went to Mardi Gras two years ago and had three shots.
[20:59.570 --> 21:01.570]  Three beers, just like with dinners,
[21:02.570 --> 21:04.570]  just because I was there and I was at sea level,
[21:05.570 --> 21:06.570]  and I wouldn't feel the repercussions of it the next day.
[21:07.570 --> 21:08.570]  I wouldn't have had I had three beers here.
[21:09.570 --> 21:10.570]  Is that where Devi happened, bro?
[21:11.570 --> 21:14.570]  No, we found out about Devi the day after we got to New Orleans.
[21:15.570 --> 21:17.570]  So the wife couldn't have any alcohol the whole time on the trip?
[21:18.570 --> 21:19.570]  That's sort of how we found out.
[21:20.570 --> 21:22.570]  The day we got there, she took a sip out,
[21:23.570 --> 21:25.570]  her first drink and got queasy and was like, man.
[21:26.570 --> 21:28.570]  And then the second day, same thing.
[21:29.570 --> 21:31.570]  And then the second day, she was like, go to Walgreens.
[21:32.570 --> 21:34.570]  And so we were in New Orleans for 10 days,
[21:35.570 --> 21:36.570]  and we found out we were pregnant on the second day.
[21:37.570 --> 21:38.570]  So you got to celebrate while you were there, kind of.
[21:39.570 --> 21:40.570]  We did. It was great.
[21:41.570 --> 21:42.570]  We celebrated the whole time. We ate a truckload of good food.
[21:43.570 --> 21:44.570]  Neither of us are real heavy drinkers anyway,
[21:45.570 --> 21:46.570]  so it's not like we were missing out on anything.
[21:47.570 --> 21:48.570]  Right, yeah.
[21:49.570 --> 21:51.570]  But yeah, I had a great time, and I had a lot to celebrate.
[21:52.570 --> 21:55.570]  But yeah, I don't really drink, and a lot of it has to do with
[21:56.570 --> 21:57.570]  I can relax and unwind with cannabis.
[21:57.570 --> 21:58.570]  And it's a much better unwind.
[21:59.570 --> 22:02.570]  There's no penalty the next day.
[22:03.570 --> 22:05.570]  And that's what I hated about drinking,
[22:06.570 --> 22:08.570]  is the incredibly bad decisions I would make while drinking.
[22:09.570 --> 22:11.570]  And then waking up the next day and paying for it all.
[22:12.570 --> 22:13.570]  Getting home while you're drunk.
[22:14.570 --> 22:15.570]  Right.
[22:16.570 --> 22:17.570]  Just figuring out how to get home.
[22:18.570 --> 22:19.570]  Am I going to drive? Am I going to take a taxi?
[22:20.570 --> 22:21.570]  Am I going to jump in one of my drunk friend's cars?
[22:22.570 --> 22:23.570]  So many nights, so many mornings I've woken up saying,
[22:24.570 --> 22:25.570]  I am so thankful that I made it home last night.
[22:25.570 --> 22:26.570]  I talked to someone today who's like,
[22:27.570 --> 22:28.570]  I quit drinking this morning.
[22:29.570 --> 22:32.570]  And it's like, I hear it a lot when you get to six months.
[22:33.570 --> 22:34.570]  Holler.
[22:35.570 --> 22:36.570]  Yeah.
[22:37.570 --> 22:39.570]  So the point we're at here is people are consuming less alcohol.
[22:40.570 --> 22:41.570]  They're consuming less pills.
[22:42.570 --> 22:44.570]  Because we are able to access cannabis safely.
[22:45.570 --> 22:48.570]  There's a lot of people who don't want that to happen.
[22:49.570 --> 22:51.570]  And there's a lot of people who don't want to lose
[22:52.570 --> 22:53.570]  that lever of control.
[22:53.570 --> 22:55.570]  To lose that lever of control on people.
[22:56.570 --> 22:59.570]  It's an immediate excuse to further a car stop.
[23:00.570 --> 23:01.570]  I smell marijuana.
[23:02.570 --> 23:04.570]  There's not one video on YouTube where the cop goes,
[23:05.570 --> 23:07.570]  I smell heroin. I want to search your vehicle.
[23:08.570 --> 23:09.570]  I want to smoke cocaine.
[23:10.570 --> 23:11.570]  Or I smell cocaine. I want to search your vehicle.
[23:12.570 --> 23:13.570]  Right.
[23:14.570 --> 23:15.570]  That video doesn't exist. It never gets said.
[23:16.570 --> 23:17.570]  I think I smell a gun. I want to search your vehicle.
[23:18.570 --> 23:21.570]  I think I smell someone you're smuggling in your trunk.
[23:21.570 --> 23:22.570]  I want to search your vehicle.
[23:23.570 --> 23:24.570]  That video doesn't exist.
[23:25.570 --> 23:26.570]  Every single video is I think I smell marijuana.
[23:27.570 --> 23:31.570]  When that steps away, everything for law enforcement gets a little bit harder.
[23:32.570 --> 23:34.570]  That is so true because I recently got pulled over.
[23:35.570 --> 23:36.570]  I talked about it on the show.
[23:37.570 --> 23:38.570]  And the first thing that cop said was,
[23:39.570 --> 23:40.570]  do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[23:41.570 --> 23:42.570]  And I had to reprogram my brain real quickly
[23:43.570 --> 23:44.570]  because first I was going, no sir, there's no weed in here.
[23:45.570 --> 23:46.570]  But then I was like, wait a minute, that's 2016, bro.
[23:47.570 --> 23:48.570]  You've got your badge on.
[23:49.570 --> 23:50.570]  You've got your purple card in your pocket.
[23:51.570 --> 23:52.570]  And he's like, maybe, because I wasn't certain,
[23:53.570 --> 23:54.570]  but there may be, there could be weed in here.
[23:55.570 --> 23:56.570]  And he's like, it smells really strong.
[23:57.570 --> 23:58.570]  And I was like, oh, I work at Agro.
[23:59.570 --> 24:00.570]  And just being honest with him, that changed everything.
[24:01.570 --> 24:02.570]  He had no problem to mess with me now.
[24:03.570 --> 24:04.570]  So you're right, that does take all the stress.
[24:05.570 --> 24:06.570]  I'm not a criminal anymore.
[24:07.570 --> 24:08.570]  The only thing I used to do wrong was have a bunch of weed in the car.
[24:09.570 --> 24:11.570]  Those first couple of law enforcement interactions are bizarre.
[24:12.570 --> 24:18.570]  It's almost a genetic response with this community at this point.
[24:19.570 --> 24:20.570]  Right.
[24:21.570 --> 24:22.570]  So we're not subject to being part of the cannabis community
[24:23.570 --> 24:24.570]  or having cannabis or supporting it in any way.
[24:25.570 --> 24:28.570]  We subject ourselves to all sorts of horrible things.
[24:29.570 --> 24:30.570]  And in Colorado, that's not true anymore.
[24:31.570 --> 24:33.570]  And as those realizations sets in, it's awesome.
[24:34.570 --> 24:37.570]  Have you been to an event or a place where you have consumed cannabis
[24:38.570 --> 24:40.570]  near law enforcement and they've watched you?
[24:41.570 --> 24:42.570]  Many times.
[24:43.570 --> 24:46.570]  Before it was legal, I was up in Denver and Boulder
[24:47.570 --> 24:50.570]  during the heydays of the Boulder Smokeout on 420.
[24:51.570 --> 24:56.570]  In the Civic Center, gatherings on 420 where tens or hundreds of thousands
[24:57.570 --> 24:58.570]  of people get together all at once.
[24:59.570 --> 25:00.570]  Everybody lights up at the same time.
[25:01.570 --> 25:02.570]  Sort of as a dare.
[25:03.570 --> 25:04.570]  Go ahead.
[25:05.570 --> 25:06.570]  There's 10,000 of us. Arrest 11 of us.
[25:07.570 --> 25:08.570]  See what happens.
[25:09.570 --> 25:11.570]  We're going to peacefully sit here and smoke pot and play bad music
[25:12.570 --> 25:14.570]  and then cheer at 420 and all smoke pot together
[25:15.570 --> 25:18.570]  and there'll be a big cloud and by 5 o'clock we'll all be gone.
[25:18.570 --> 25:23.570]  The shops in the area that sell food will all make an extra 5 grand, 10 grand that day.
[25:24.570 --> 25:25.570]  Everybody's happy.
[25:26.570 --> 25:29.570]  Everybody except people that have to take public transportation
[25:30.570 --> 25:31.570]  or commute during those hours.
[25:32.570 --> 25:34.570]  Uber drivers are making mad money.
[25:35.570 --> 25:36.570]  Same thing downtown Denver.
[25:37.570 --> 25:39.570]  100,000 people just convene at Civic Center.
[25:40.570 --> 25:43.570]  The cops stand by and they always had.
[25:44.570 --> 25:46.570]  And just kind of made sure everything was calm and collected
[25:46.570 --> 25:48.570]  and nobody got out of control and it was fine.
[25:49.570 --> 25:52.570]  But post legalization, only a few.
[25:53.570 --> 25:54.570]  It's just I've been too busy.
[25:55.570 --> 25:56.570]  I always end up working those days.
[25:57.570 --> 25:58.570]  You're not the guy that goes to all the events.
[25:59.570 --> 26:00.570]  You're not that dude.
[26:01.570 --> 26:02.570]  I desperately want to go to the next secret sesh.
[26:03.570 --> 26:05.570]  I need to get out and enjoy a few events now.
[26:06.570 --> 26:07.570]  August 27th.
[26:08.570 --> 26:10.570]  And now that Davey's a little bit older, I can start doing that a little bit easier.
[26:11.570 --> 26:12.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:13.570 --> 26:14.570]  He's going to be so much fun pretty soon.
[26:14.570 --> 26:17.570]  So I remember the first time we used to go to smoke nights
[26:18.570 --> 26:19.570]  at the Cloud 9 hookah bar here in Pueblo.
[26:20.570 --> 26:22.570]  I've talked about them on the podcast way back in the early episodes
[26:23.570 --> 26:24.570]  because that was back in the day here.
[26:25.570 --> 26:26.570]  Since then, they've shut them down.
[26:27.570 --> 26:28.570]  We can't do that here in Pueblo anymore.
[26:29.570 --> 26:30.570]  But we were at the Cloud 9 hookah bar and I was sitting.
[26:31.570 --> 26:34.570]  I was at the bar, which is it's an old bar, but it's now turned into a hookah bar.
[26:35.570 --> 26:36.570]  But they didn't change much.
[26:37.570 --> 26:38.570]  You know, still got the bar seating.
[26:39.570 --> 26:40.570]  They just put hookahs out.
[26:41.570 --> 26:42.570]  I was sitting at the bar and there was one person and then me.
[26:42.570 --> 26:46.570]  It was my little oil slick pad, my rig, my torch, my little variety of hash.
[26:47.570 --> 26:48.570]  I was hitting a bowl.
[26:49.570 --> 26:50.570]  I was hitting a bowl that night.
[26:51.570 --> 26:52.570]  I had a bowl with some flowers in it.
[26:53.570 --> 26:54.570]  I had a bag of weed next to me.
[26:55.570 --> 26:56.570]  And I was just chilling, just sitting on the bar stool.
[26:57.570 --> 26:58.570]  And the cops walked in, three of them together.
[26:59.570 --> 27:00.570]  And I heard the radio.
[27:01.570 --> 27:02.570]  You always hear the, and then they walk in and I was like, ah, what do I do?
[27:03.570 --> 27:04.570]  And I thought, fucking sit here, dude.
[27:05.570 --> 27:06.570]  You're a 21 year old.
[27:07.570 --> 27:08.570]  You're over 21.
[27:09.570 --> 27:10.570]  You've got a red card in your pocket, a purple card now.
[27:10.570 --> 27:12.570]  The owner of this place is who's going to have to fucking deal with anything.
[27:13.570 --> 27:15.570]  Those cops walked right past me and they went and talked to the owner.
[27:16.570 --> 27:17.570]  The owner nodded and smiled a couple of times.
[27:18.570 --> 27:19.570]  They all shook hands.
[27:20.570 --> 27:22.570]  The cops walked past me and they kind of looked at my, what I had sitting on the table.
[27:23.570 --> 27:24.570]  Like, they looked at it more curiously.
[27:25.570 --> 27:26.570]  They were like, huh, okay.
[27:27.570 --> 27:28.570]  That's what smoking hash supplies look like.
[27:29.570 --> 27:30.570]  And they walked past it and they nodded at me and they kind of smiled like,
[27:31.570 --> 27:32.570]  yeah, what's up stoner?
[27:33.570 --> 27:34.570]  Like one of them kind of condescendingly smiled.
[27:35.570 --> 27:36.570]  Like what's up you weed head, you're high as fuck.
[27:37.570 --> 27:38.570]  And the other two just kind of nodded politely.
[27:38.570 --> 27:39.570]  One of the kids that was there was a younger dude.
[27:40.570 --> 27:44.570]  Just being a typical dude, I probably would have said the same thing fucking 15 years ago.
[27:45.570 --> 27:47.570]  But as soon as they got outside, he goes, man, fuck the police.
[27:48.570 --> 27:50.570]  And I looked at him and I was like, bro, unfuck those police.
[27:51.570 --> 27:52.570]  They didn't take my hash and we didn't go to jail.
[27:53.570 --> 27:54.570]  Because you were the first motherfucker they saw when they walked in here.
[27:55.570 --> 27:56.570]  Like they didn't do anything.
[27:57.570 --> 27:59.570]  So yeah, it was like I had to remind him like we didn't go to jail for that, dude.
[28:00.570 --> 28:02.570]  Like two years ago, they would have threw me on the floor.
[28:03.570 --> 28:04.570]  Like just for having that shit.
[28:04.570 --> 28:06.570]  And there are a lot of people who don't want to give that out.
[28:07.570 --> 28:11.570]  And that's why you see the DEA make decisions like this.
[28:12.570 --> 28:14.570]  It's just silly.
[28:15.570 --> 28:16.570]  It is silly.
[28:17.570 --> 28:19.570]  If they would have rescheduled cannabis to a schedule two substance,
[28:20.570 --> 28:23.570]  what that would have meant is it would have now been allowable for prescriptions
[28:24.570 --> 28:25.570]  by all medical doctors.
[28:26.570 --> 28:28.570]  So they'd be able to write you a prescription for cannabis basically.
[28:29.570 --> 28:32.570]  Well, and they also, it makes research significant.
[28:32.570 --> 28:34.570]  It makes research significantly easier.
[28:35.570 --> 28:41.570]  I mean, I hate to keep going back to CNN specials because CNN is usually obnoxious as all hell.
[28:42.570 --> 28:44.570]  But their marijuana reporting that they've done has been spectacular.
[28:45.570 --> 28:51.570]  It's easy to research cocaine in the US because it's a schedule two drug.
[28:52.570 --> 28:57.570]  It's easy to research schedule two drugs because they're schedule two.
[28:58.570 --> 29:00.570]  If they're schedule one, significantly more red tape.
[29:00.570 --> 29:02.570]  Much, much harder to research.
[29:03.570 --> 29:08.570]  And I mean, it takes years of going through approval meetings and submitting paperwork,
[29:09.570 --> 29:11.570]  years to just begin your study.
[29:12.570 --> 29:14.570]  And then in studies take years to complete.
[29:15.570 --> 29:19.570]  They take more years to write the conclusions, examine the data, all of that.
[29:20.570 --> 29:22.570]  And then more years to publish.
[29:23.570 --> 29:27.570]  And when you add another decade of red tape at the beginning of all that,
[29:27.570 --> 29:31.570]  marijuana research is something that's not going to happen until we're all men.
[29:32.570 --> 29:35.570]  And that's because it's a schedule one drug.
[29:36.570 --> 29:39.570]  And moving into schedule two changes all that.
[29:40.570 --> 29:46.570]  Any competent researcher can submit the paperwork and within a relatively reasonable amount of time begin researching.
[29:47.570 --> 29:48.570]  And none of those changes were made.
[29:49.570 --> 29:52.570]  And so even though they created more places to grow it,
[29:52.570 --> 29:57.570]  and the selection of research grade cannabis that's available to be researched will be expanding,
[29:58.570 --> 30:00.570]  access to that material won't be.
[30:01.570 --> 30:02.570]  And that's really unfortunate.
[30:03.570 --> 30:06.570]  And this is why I rant and tell people to vote.
[30:07.570 --> 30:13.570]  Because none of this shit changes until A, most of the people involved in this have gotten old and died.
[30:14.570 --> 30:20.570]  Like we just have to wait until the generation that's so tied to this has seceded power to our generation.
[30:20.570 --> 30:22.570]  And it's just going to take another couple of decades.
[30:23.570 --> 30:27.570]  And in the meantime, we need more people in our generation politically active.
[30:28.570 --> 30:34.570]  So many members of our community tuned out because if we spoke up about what we believed in, we went to jail.
[30:35.570 --> 30:38.570]  I was scared, dude. Back in the day, you would be like, come to these little city council meetings with me.
[30:39.570 --> 30:42.570]  And I was like, no, I grow and that scared.
[30:43.570 --> 30:49.570]  Well, and that's part of the reason I became the politically active one down here is because I didn't physically have the space to grow.
[30:50.570 --> 30:53.570]  Or the money for the startup equipment.
[30:54.570 --> 30:57.570]  And so I didn't like go ahead and show my ass the warrant.
[30:58.570 --> 31:00.570]  You get to the result 12 square feet.
[31:01.570 --> 31:03.570]  Start with the dirty laundry prick.
[31:04.570 --> 31:05.570]  Like I didn't care.
[31:06.570 --> 31:07.570]  I like I could have cops show up.
[31:08.570 --> 31:11.570]  I could have cops pull me over and demand to search my car and I'd be okay.
[31:12.570 --> 31:14.570]  Most of the time.
[31:15.570 --> 31:21.570]  But I was able to risk it where a lot of other people in the community simply weren't in a position to do that.
[31:22.570 --> 31:30.570]  But one of the one of the really interesting things that I noticed when I spoke out is that it gives you a shield.
[31:31.570 --> 31:39.570]  When you go to city council meeting reporters for the local paper there, if you live in a major city reporters for major papers are there.
[31:39.570 --> 31:55.570]  When the guy that comes down to city council or the county commissioner meetings and makes really coherent articulate arguments in the appropriate manner and setting for marijuana gets his house raided.
[31:56.570 --> 32:00.570]  They break a bunch of furniture, rough him up, shoot his dog and don't find anything.
[32:01.570 --> 32:04.570]  That shit makes the front page of the Washington Post every day for a week.
[32:05.570 --> 32:07.570]  And they know this and so it doesn't happen.
[32:08.570 --> 32:10.570]  And that's not universally true.
[32:11.570 --> 32:21.570]  It's not being granted immunity by a judge, but it does provide you a significant layer of protection because by becoming mildly public you're granted some of that protection.
[32:22.570 --> 32:23.570]  All right.
[32:23.570 --> 32:24.570]  So the DEA failed you guys.
[32:25.570 --> 32:26.570]  That was my point of that topic.
[32:27.570 --> 32:28.570]  I want to move on to another topic here.
[32:29.570 --> 32:30.570]  Mike, thanks for having a whole lot of info on that one for supporting me on that.
[32:31.570 --> 32:32.570]  Y'all just learned a lot.
[32:33.570 --> 32:34.570]  I rambled a lot, but you like it.
[32:35.570 --> 32:36.570]  Both both happened.
[32:37.570 --> 32:39.570]  It is now Wednesday, August 17th as we were recording this.
[32:40.570 --> 32:41.570]  It just passed midnight.
[32:42.570 --> 32:43.570]  Right now it is August 17th.
[32:44.570 --> 32:45.570]  Happy birthday Gibbs. Gibbs, I don't know if you listen to this podcast, bro.
[32:46.570 --> 32:47.570]  I love you. It's great being your friend.
[32:48.570 --> 32:49.570]  I miss you. I wish we'd hang out more.
[32:50.570 --> 32:51.570]  I hope everything is going well for you.
[32:52.570 --> 32:53.570]  Happy fucking birthday, Giblet.
[32:54.570 --> 32:58.570]  Also today marks the anniversary of the first time that my friend Amanda and myself took dabs together.
[32:59.570 --> 33:00.570]  Amanda has been in Colorado for one year now.
[33:01.570 --> 33:02.570]  Amanda, I don't know what Colorado would be like without you.
[33:03.570 --> 33:04.570]  I'm so glad you showed up.
[33:04.570 --> 33:05.570]  Yeah, fucking friends forever there, dude.
[33:06.570 --> 33:08.570]  Not to get all sappy on everybody, but some landmarks to note.
[33:09.570 --> 33:10.570]  Shout out to Gibbs and Amanda.
[33:11.570 --> 33:12.570]  Love you guys.
[33:13.570 --> 33:14.570]  Glad you're on my roster.
[33:15.570 --> 33:16.570]  I said I was going to bring an email to the table to read.
[33:17.570 --> 33:20.570]  I took a screenshot of it because it's much easier than going and searching through shit.
[33:21.570 --> 33:22.570]  Let me read this message to you.
[33:23.570 --> 33:24.570]  I've got two of them.
[33:25.570 --> 33:29.570]  This one says, first of all, he said, sucks that sucks about the granny podcast.
[33:30.570 --> 33:33.570]  He said you killed it with the emails, though, and we love your updates.
[33:34.570 --> 33:35.570]  On your genetics.
[33:36.570 --> 33:38.570]  I should give you guys a quick update on that because I said I would do that.
[33:39.570 --> 33:43.570]  The male plant, we are now, the date is now the 17th, so we are now 14 days in.
[33:44.570 --> 33:47.570]  You guys, the male plant just started sprinkling a little bit of pollen.
[33:48.570 --> 33:50.570]  Little itty bitty bitty bits of pollen are coming out of them.
[33:51.570 --> 33:52.570]  The girls are just starting to go into full flower.
[33:53.570 --> 33:55.570]  You can see their calyx pistils are just going nuts right now.
[33:56.570 --> 33:57.570]  The stretch phase is in full fledge.
[33:58.570 --> 34:00.570]  They'll quit stretching in about a week.
[34:01.570 --> 34:03.570]  I'll let them get pollen in about seven to 10 days.
[34:04.570 --> 34:05.570]  I'm getting a lot of pollen on them.
[34:06.570 --> 34:07.570]  I've got pollen in a jar for backup.
[34:08.570 --> 34:09.570]  I've also got that male throwing pollen.
[34:10.570 --> 34:11.570]  They're going to get pollinated.
[34:12.570 --> 34:13.570]  So they're looking great.
[34:14.570 --> 34:15.570]  Everything is going beautifully on the breeding project.
[34:16.570 --> 34:17.570]  Everything is on schedule.
[34:18.570 --> 34:19.570]  Not a whole lot to report other than the male.
[34:20.570 --> 34:21.570]  His balls are big and he's just barely starting to dump pollen.
[34:22.570 --> 34:25.570]  So this message says, I was wondering what you know about fox tailing.
[34:26.570 --> 34:29.570]  I don't really understand what is happening and whether it's a good or bad thing.
[34:30.570 --> 34:31.570]  When it happens, maybe a good show topic.
[34:31.570 --> 34:32.570]  I replied with great topic.
[34:33.570 --> 34:35.570]  So that was a message that actually came from a friend on Instagram.
[34:36.570 --> 34:37.570]  The email has been killer lately.
[34:38.570 --> 34:40.570]  I get a lot of topics, a lot of content from the people that are sending me emails.
[34:41.570 --> 34:42.570]  I really appreciate that.
[34:43.570 --> 34:44.570]  Send me your emails, guys.
[34:45.570 --> 34:46.570]  Send them to me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.570]  That's the easiest way to reach me.
[34:49.570 --> 34:50.570]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[34:51.570 --> 34:52.570]  It's easier if I filter all the questions through that one channel.
[34:53.570 --> 34:54.570]  I'll read your questions wherever they come from, honestly.
[34:55.570 --> 34:56.570]  Because I know you're not.
[34:57.570 --> 34:58.570]  Some of us are friends on Instagram, on Twitter, on whatever.
[34:59.570 --> 35:00.570]  Wherever we're friends, send me emails.
[35:01.570 --> 35:02.570]  I'll read it, but it's easier.
[35:03.570 --> 35:05.570]  You got more of a chance if you hit me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[35:06.570 --> 35:07.570]  So this guy wants to know about fox tailing.
[35:08.570 --> 35:13.570]  Fox tailing is when you're growing some buds and they start popping off like little fox tails, little fingers.
[35:14.570 --> 35:15.570]  They start spreading out a little bit.
[35:16.570 --> 35:17.570]  I call them Cheeto fingers too.
[35:18.570 --> 35:19.570]  Cheeto fingers, yeah.
[35:20.570 --> 35:21.570]  But yeah, fox tails is the appropriate term.
[35:22.570 --> 35:23.570]  Some strains, it's genetic.
[35:24.570 --> 35:30.570]  If the bud stays compact, if it's tight and it's doing what looks like a fox tail, more like a crown,
[35:31.570 --> 35:32.570]  that's genetic.
[35:33.570 --> 35:38.570]  If the bud is airy and you're getting fox tailing, that is most likely from too much heat.
[35:39.570 --> 35:40.570]  That's usually what that's from.
[35:41.570 --> 35:42.570]  Your plants are probably too hot.
[35:43.570 --> 35:44.570]  They're probably a little bit too close to the light.
[35:45.570 --> 35:48.570]  Also, coming with that fox tailing, you may see a little bit of taco leaf.
[35:49.570 --> 35:50.570]  Your leaf will look healthy.
[35:51.570 --> 35:53.570]  It'll look cool, except on the edges, it'll be folding up like a taco shell.
[35:54.570 --> 35:56.570]  You could just make a little taco out of your leaf right there.
[35:57.570 --> 35:58.570]  Both of those are visual descriptors.
[35:58.570 --> 36:01.570]  Yeah, so if you're seeing both of those, it certainly is too hot in there.
[36:02.570 --> 36:08.570]  I've seen it most often when we call it kissing the sky, where the plants grow up into the light while they're in bloom.
[36:09.570 --> 36:11.570]  Yeah, that's probably what's happening to this guy's poor plants.
[36:12.570 --> 36:15.570]  If that's not the case, fox tailing could be from too much humidity.
[36:16.570 --> 36:17.570]  They're trying to spread out.
[36:18.570 --> 36:20.570]  This is the grossest description I could give you, but it's completely accurate.
[36:21.570 --> 36:22.570]  Mike knows where I'm going with this.
[36:23.570 --> 36:24.570]  Imagine you're in Las Vegas in the summer.
[36:25.570 --> 36:26.570]  It's like 114 degrees outside.
[36:26.570 --> 36:28.570]  Your man junk tries to just move away from your body.
[36:29.570 --> 36:30.570]  These plants are doing the same thing.
[36:31.570 --> 36:32.570]  It's too hot.
[36:33.570 --> 36:34.570]  Your balls want to get away.
[36:35.570 --> 36:36.570]  These plants are too hot.
[36:37.570 --> 36:38.570]  They want to get away from each other.
[36:39.570 --> 36:40.570]  They're starting to sweat.
[36:41.570 --> 36:42.570]  They're getting funky.
[36:43.570 --> 36:44.570]  They're just trying to peel off of each other so they're not getting sweaty and funky and compacted in there.
[36:45.570 --> 36:46.570]  The plant's just trying to make some air room for itself.
[36:47.570 --> 36:48.570]  It's trying to get spongy.
[36:49.570 --> 36:50.570]  It's fox tailing out a little bit.
[36:51.570 --> 36:52.570]  It's going to get fluffy.
[36:53.570 --> 36:55.570]  It's getting heat stressed is probably what's happening, or you could be overfeeding it.
[36:56.570 --> 36:57.570]  That's when the fox tailing happens.
[36:58.570 --> 36:59.570]  One of those three.
[37:00.570 --> 37:01.570]  It's nine times out of 10, your plant hit the light.
[37:02.570 --> 37:06.570]  Some jelly bean phenotypes like to make a crown-shaped fox tail.
[37:07.570 --> 37:10.570]  Strawberry banana tangy likes to make some crown-shaped fox tails.
[37:11.570 --> 37:13.570]  Tangy, I guess it's a lot of things crossed to that.
[37:14.570 --> 37:15.570]  Calio.
[37:16.570 --> 37:17.570]  I worked with the lemon haze phenotype that did it.
[37:18.570 --> 37:19.570]  If it got within eight inches of the light, it was a bitch.
[37:20.570 --> 37:22.570]  The plant would drip.
[37:23.570 --> 37:24.570]  The grower wouldn't get rid of it.
[37:24.570 --> 37:25.570]  Literally, when you were harvesting, it would just drip THC.
[37:26.570 --> 37:27.570]  It was insane.
[37:28.570 --> 37:29.570]  That's awesome.
[37:30.570 --> 37:31.570]  I think I know that plant.
[37:32.570 --> 37:33.570]  I know what you're talking about.
[37:34.570 --> 37:35.570]  The closer, if it got within 10 inches of the light, it would fox tail like mad.
[37:36.570 --> 37:38.570]  Chances are, bro, your plant is getting too close to the light.
[37:39.570 --> 37:40.570]  It's a little bit too hot.
[37:41.570 --> 37:44.570]  If that's not the case, send me a follow-up message, and we'll figure out what's going on.
[37:45.570 --> 37:46.570]  We'll talk about it on a future episode.
[37:47.570 --> 37:48.570]  I truly do appreciate the interaction with my listeners.
[37:49.570 --> 37:50.570]  Send me more questions, more messages.
[37:51.570 --> 37:52.570]  I love it, you guys.
[37:52.570 --> 37:53.570]  I like it a lot.
[37:54.570 --> 37:55.570]  I want to read one more email.
[37:56.570 --> 37:57.570]  This one's going to be quick.
[37:58.570 --> 37:59.570]  I'm finding it on my phone here.
[38:00.570 --> 38:01.570]  I did take another screenshot.
[38:02.570 --> 38:04.570]  This one says, hey, I was listening to the podcast today, and I heard you answer my questions on the air.
[38:05.570 --> 38:06.570]  This one's from Mazzer420, by the way.
[38:07.570 --> 38:08.570]  He said, it was a trip.
[38:09.570 --> 38:10.570]  Then he said, thanks for that, bro.
[38:11.570 --> 38:12.570]  When I say I work with robots, I just meant they act like robots.
[38:13.570 --> 38:15.570]  Remember, I asked, are they real robots, or are these people that act like robots?
[38:16.570 --> 38:18.570]  Then he said, I kind of like office space, but different.
[38:19.570 --> 38:20.570]  He said, I got another question for the show.
[38:20.570 --> 38:21.570]  I was hoping you could shine some light on.
[38:22.570 --> 38:23.570]  Then he said, show questions.
[38:24.570 --> 38:25.570]  Number one, what are your thoughts on monster cropping?
[38:26.570 --> 38:28.570]  Then he said, I read that it's great to use for Scrog.
[38:29.570 --> 38:30.570]  Honestly, I don't know a lot about monster cropping.
[38:31.570 --> 38:33.570]  All you got to do is send me another message and tell me what monster cropping is,
[38:34.570 --> 38:35.570]  and I'll tell you my opinions on it.
[38:36.570 --> 38:37.570]  I'll learn about it.
[38:38.570 --> 38:39.570]  Just tell me what's going on there.
[38:40.570 --> 38:41.570]  I don't know what you mean by monster cropping.
[38:42.570 --> 38:43.570]  There's a couple things that could mean.
[38:44.570 --> 38:45.570]  You could mean by snapping the stems and bending them.
[38:46.570 --> 38:48.570]  If that's what you mean, that's cool, but it takes too long for my type of growth.
[38:49.570 --> 38:53.570]  Number two question, he said, I was curious to hear your thoughts on LEDs,
[38:54.570 --> 38:55.570]  any experience using one.
[38:56.570 --> 38:58.570]  I don't have any personal experience with LEDs, so I don't have a lot to tell you.
[38:59.570 --> 39:02.570]  I can tell you that it changes the way your plants function.
[39:03.570 --> 39:04.570]  They do everything.
[39:05.570 --> 39:06.570]  They use their nutrients differently.
[39:07.570 --> 39:08.570]  They drink differently.
[39:09.570 --> 39:12.570]  I've seen friends run side by sides with LEDs and HPS lights,
[39:13.570 --> 39:16.570]  and the LED plants and the HPS lights looked completely different,
[39:16.570 --> 39:17.570]  being fed the same thing.
[39:18.570 --> 39:19.570]  They photosynthesize differently.
[39:20.570 --> 39:21.570]  They want different nutrients.
[39:22.570 --> 39:23.570]  It's a whole new thing to learn.
[39:24.570 --> 39:25.570]  I don't have any experience with it personally.
[39:26.570 --> 39:27.570]  I can't guide you on any lights to use.
[39:28.570 --> 39:29.570]  I don't know enough.
[39:30.570 --> 39:34.570]  I spend a lot of time researching light spectrums and their effects on plants,
[39:35.570 --> 39:36.570]  and yeah, that'll answer some of that.
[39:37.570 --> 39:41.570]  I've only seen them really successfully regularly used as auxiliary color augmentation.
[39:42.570 --> 39:43.570]  Right.
[39:43.570 --> 39:47.570]  When they're a primary light source, every harvest I've seen has been minuscule.
[39:48.570 --> 39:49.570]  I'll give a shout out to my friend Nancy Budwell.
[39:50.570 --> 39:53.570]  She grows with a very specific brand of LED lights, and she kills it.
[39:54.570 --> 39:55.570]  Her plants are gorgeous.
[39:56.570 --> 39:59.570]  Yeah, but I've only ever seen the cheaper ones in action.
[40:00.570 --> 40:01.570]  Right.
[40:02.570 --> 40:03.570]  I've never seen the $1,800 version.
[40:04.570 --> 40:06.570]  The lights that Nancy are using, those lights are quite expensive.
[40:07.570 --> 40:08.570]  They're $1,000 to $1,400 lights.
[40:08.570 --> 40:14.570]  LEDs can be extremely expensive, but allegedly you pay for it in the first year in electrical savings.
[40:15.570 --> 40:16.570]  Right.
[40:17.570 --> 40:18.570]  You got to throw it down on the table to walk out with that light,
[40:19.570 --> 40:22.570]  but you're not going to have to pay the electric bill every month like I do with my HPS lights,
[40:23.570 --> 40:26.570]  and you don't have to run as much electricity on an air conditioner to cool it off also.
[40:27.570 --> 40:28.570]  There's a huge power saving there.
[40:29.570 --> 40:31.570]  I've never seen them effectively used alone.
[40:32.570 --> 40:35.570]  Check out Nancy Budwell on Facebook or Instagram,
[40:35.570 --> 40:38.570]  and she is a representative for a specific lighting company,
[40:39.570 --> 40:42.570]  and she has great pictures, and she will guide you through your purchase of an LED light
[40:43.570 --> 40:44.570]  if it's something that you're really interested in.
[40:45.570 --> 40:46.570]  He's got a third part to this question.
[40:47.570 --> 40:50.570]  It says, also wondering what are your thoughts on hempy buckets and deep water culture?
[40:51.570 --> 40:53.570]  What are the pros and cons and your likes and dislikes?
[40:54.570 --> 40:57.570]  I am not super experienced in deep water culture.
[40:58.570 --> 40:59.570]  Do you remember our friend from Hawaii?
[41:00.570 --> 41:03.570]  That dude grew some deep water culture buckets and did some great work.
[41:03.570 --> 41:06.570]  The problem was if something goes wrong, everything goes wrong.
[41:07.570 --> 41:09.570]  If your pump goes out on that deep water culture pump,
[41:10.570 --> 41:12.570]  and you don't spray for three or four hours, if it quits spraying,
[41:13.570 --> 41:14.570]  your plants are going to die.
[41:15.570 --> 41:16.570]  That's the major dislike to it.
[41:17.570 --> 41:18.570]  I thought it was awesome.
[41:19.570 --> 41:21.570]  Our buddy had five gallon deep water culture buckets,
[41:22.570 --> 41:23.570]  and his plants were taller than me, and I'm six foot five,
[41:24.570 --> 41:25.570]  and they were putting on weight.
[41:26.570 --> 41:27.570]  They were packing it up.
[41:28.570 --> 41:30.570]  The only problem is he had a lot of fungus gnats all the damn time.
[41:31.570 --> 41:32.570]  He could not get rid of the fungus gnats.
[41:33.570 --> 41:35.570]  I've never done it myself, so I don't have a lot of experience,
[41:36.570 --> 41:38.570]  but that's what our Hawaiian friend was experiencing from what I saw.
[41:39.570 --> 41:41.570]  I spent a lot of time researching different growth methods,
[41:42.570 --> 41:44.570]  and this one scares me because of its complexity.
[41:45.570 --> 41:46.570]  It's the same thing with hydro.
[41:47.570 --> 41:50.570]  The more complicated it gets, the more random things might fail
[41:51.570 --> 41:54.570]  and cause your crop to suicide when you're only gone for six hours.
[41:55.570 --> 41:56.570]  That's why I'm a soil grower.
[41:57.570 --> 41:58.570]  Honestly, soil is insanely forgiving,
[41:58.570 --> 42:02.570]  and part of the reasons for that are what make me favor it.
[42:03.570 --> 42:04.570]  Let's talk about deep water culture a little bit
[42:05.570 --> 42:06.570]  because there might be people out there going,
[42:07.570 --> 42:08.570]  what the hell is deep water culture?
[42:09.570 --> 42:10.570]  Basically, deep water culture is a five gallon bucket.
[42:11.570 --> 42:12.570]  This is just a one.
[42:13.570 --> 42:14.570]  You can do multiple site deep water culture buckets,
[42:15.570 --> 42:16.570]  and you can have a main bucket that feeds
[42:17.570 --> 42:18.570]  or a main reservoir that feeds multiple buckets,
[42:19.570 --> 42:20.570]  but for a one plant deep water culture bucket,
[42:21.570 --> 42:22.570]  you've got a five gallon bucket,
[42:23.570 --> 42:25.570]  and then there's a lid type device that goes on top of the bucket,
[42:26.570 --> 42:27.570]  but it's got a little mesh basket cut out of the center of it.
[42:28.570 --> 42:30.570]  You fill that area with rockwool cubes,
[42:31.570 --> 42:33.570]  and you put, not rockwool, the hydrotone clay balls.
[42:34.570 --> 42:35.570]  The hydrotone clay balls.
[42:36.570 --> 42:37.570]  Then you put your clone that's in a rockwool.
[42:38.570 --> 42:39.570]  You just set it in there, and then it'll root,
[42:40.570 --> 42:41.570]  and the roots will hang down inside of that five gallon bucket.
[42:42.570 --> 42:44.570]  Inside that five gallon bucket, you put a sprayer.
[42:45.570 --> 42:47.570]  There are a lot of different types of sprayers available.
[42:48.570 --> 42:49.570]  There are so many different ways to do it.
[42:50.570 --> 42:51.570]  They sell a circular.
[42:52.570 --> 42:53.570]  It's a circle sprayer that's got spray jets that shoot straight up,
[42:54.570 --> 42:55.570]  and it's a mister type thing.
[42:56.570 --> 42:57.570]  You're misting the bottom here.
[42:58.570 --> 43:00.570]  It's a long growth version of the auto cloner.
[43:01.570 --> 43:03.570]  It's a real big easy cloner is basically what it is.
[43:04.570 --> 43:06.570]  You want to mist those roots from the bottom real heavily,
[43:07.570 --> 43:09.570]  and you put nutrients in the water and a lot of oxygen,
[43:10.570 --> 43:13.570]  heavily oxygenated and nutriented water spraying from the bottom
[43:14.570 --> 43:16.570]  so that those roots hang down into that and grow into that spraying water
[43:17.570 --> 43:18.570]  because gravity makes the roots want to go down.
[43:19.570 --> 43:20.570]  I think gravity does.
[43:21.570 --> 43:22.570]  I don't know if they just want to go down or if it's gravity.
[43:23.570 --> 43:24.570]  They may just want to do it naturally.
[43:25.570 --> 43:26.570]  The water is spraying up onto there, and it's growing.
[43:26.570 --> 43:28.570]  You put it on a timer so that it stops every once in a while
[43:29.570 --> 43:31.570]  so the roots can dry so that they don't rot.
[43:32.570 --> 43:33.570]  Then you just keep it cycling.
[43:34.570 --> 43:35.570]  Every 45 minutes, it shuts off for 15.
[43:36.570 --> 43:38.570]  That lets your water cool down so that the pump doesn't overheat your water
[43:39.570 --> 43:41.570]  because the oxygen pump and the fucking moving it pump
[43:42.570 --> 43:43.570]  is going to make that water hot.
[43:44.570 --> 43:45.570]  A lot of people throw a chiller in there to keep that water cool.
[43:46.570 --> 43:47.570]  It's a lot of work.
[43:48.570 --> 43:50.570]  It's a lot of technology, and if one piece of all that tech goes wrong,
[43:51.570 --> 43:53.570]  your whole thing could die, but the production is amazing.
[43:53.570 --> 43:55.570]  The plant seems to really love it when everything's humming,
[43:56.570 --> 43:58.570]  but it's one of those things where if you're setting up
[43:59.570 --> 44:01.570]  the one-bucket version on the cheap,
[44:02.570 --> 44:03.570]  that's the quality of the parts.
[44:04.570 --> 44:06.570]  You just require constant attention.
[44:07.570 --> 44:10.570]  You have to understand that your plant's got a gun to its head
[44:11.570 --> 44:12.570]  and the hammer's cocked.
[44:13.570 --> 44:14.570]  One piece fails, and that trigger gets pulled,
[44:15.570 --> 44:17.570]  and you start over, period.
[44:18.570 --> 44:20.570]  That's why I read that far in the book,
[44:20.570 --> 44:21.570]  and was like, I know enough.
[44:22.570 --> 44:23.570]  Next chapter.
[44:24.570 --> 44:26.570]  So, Mazhar, I know I couldn't answer a lot of your questions,
[44:27.570 --> 44:29.570]  but at least I gave you the answers that I had.
[44:30.570 --> 44:31.570]  I don't know a lot about monster cropping.
[44:32.570 --> 44:33.570]  Tell me what you think monster cropping means
[44:34.570 --> 44:36.570]  because if you Google it, there are several different takes
[44:37.570 --> 44:38.570]  just because that's a very common word.
[44:39.570 --> 44:40.570]  Let me know what you're thinking.
[44:41.570 --> 44:42.570]  I'll talk more about that.
[44:43.570 --> 44:44.570]  LEDs, no experience, dude.
[44:45.570 --> 44:46.570]  I told you what I saw from my friends.
[44:47.570 --> 44:48.570]  Deepwater Culture, we ranted on what I saw from my buddy,
[44:48.570 --> 44:50.570]  called him Pineapple Express because he's from Hawaii.
[44:51.570 --> 44:52.570]  That's what I used to call him all the time.
[44:53.570 --> 44:54.570]  But Mazhar420, thanks for the email.
[44:55.570 --> 44:56.570]  Please send me more emails.
[44:57.570 --> 44:59.570]  We will talk more about this stuff on a future episode.
[45:00.570 --> 45:01.570]  Yeah, we will.
[45:02.570 --> 45:03.570]  I looked up at Mike, and he was just blank.
[45:04.570 --> 45:05.570]  He was staring into the microphone.
[45:06.570 --> 45:07.570]  No, the rig's looking at me.
[45:08.570 --> 45:09.570]  Do you need a dab?
[45:10.570 --> 45:11.570]  You want to take some dabs on the show?
[45:12.570 --> 45:13.570]  No, I did already, and I think I'm probably still good.
[45:14.570 --> 45:15.570]  I'm going to dab the rest of what is on this parchment paper.
[45:16.570 --> 45:17.570]  This is some pineapple jack from our friends at Total.
[45:18.570 --> 45:19.570]  Perfect.
[45:20.570 --> 45:21.570]  By last quarter gram.
[45:22.570 --> 45:23.570]  That's probably a quarter gram, but I'm going to take this,
[45:24.570 --> 45:26.570]  and then I think we're going to wrap up the show after that.
[45:27.570 --> 45:28.570]  Mike, got anything poignant to say?
[45:29.570 --> 45:31.570]  We're gearing up for November.
[45:32.570 --> 45:33.570]  Make sure you can do it online most places.
[45:34.570 --> 45:35.570]  Make sure you're registered to vote.
[45:36.570 --> 45:38.570]  Make sure you know what election issues are coming up in your area.
[45:39.570 --> 45:41.570]  Take a minute to actually research them.
[45:42.570 --> 45:43.570]  It's going to be a hell of an election.
[45:44.570 --> 45:46.570]  All the news is focused on the search for the right person.
[45:46.570 --> 45:48.570]  All the news is focused on the circus that is the presidential race.
[45:49.570 --> 45:53.570]  Honestly, it's the local stuff that really, really, really matters.
[45:54.570 --> 45:56.570]  That's the stuff that's really going to impact your day to day.
[45:57.570 --> 45:59.570]  Did you just say day to day?
[46:00.570 --> 46:01.570]  I did.
[46:02.570 --> 46:07.570]  That's the local issue stuff, the things that tend to really matter to most people.
[46:08.570 --> 46:10.570]  Take a minute to figure out what those are.
[46:11.570 --> 46:13.570]  The local issues are now set.
[46:13.570 --> 46:16.570]  County voters will be voting on one marijuana question,
[46:17.570 --> 46:19.570]  whether or not they want to ban the industry.
[46:20.570 --> 46:22.570]  City voters will be voting on three marijuana questions.
[46:23.570 --> 46:26.570]  The first one, do you want to ban the rec industry, yes or no?
[46:27.570 --> 46:31.570]  The second question, do you want to allow recreational stores, yes or no?
[46:32.570 --> 46:37.570]  And the third question, do you want to tax those stores at like 4.5%?
[46:38.570 --> 46:40.570]  Kind of a confusing set of questions.
[46:40.570 --> 46:45.570]  And there's reasons for that, like a lot of complicated reasons for all of those three questions
[46:46.570 --> 46:48.570]  appearing in front of public city voters.
[46:49.570 --> 46:51.570]  But you need to know which questions which.
[46:52.570 --> 46:56.570]  You need to know the wording so that you don't accidentally vote the wrong way.
[46:57.570 --> 47:02.570]  And it's important that you know that stuff regardless of whether you live near me or not.
[47:03.570 --> 47:06.570]  Because whatever the issues are in your area, they will impact you personally.
[47:06.570 --> 47:08.570]  Make sure you know what's up and make sure you vote.
[47:09.570 --> 47:12.570]  Have you gone to your Facebook page, your Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws Facebook page,
[47:13.570 --> 47:17.570]  and kind of typed in guidance on which way to vote since it is worded awkwardly?
[47:18.570 --> 47:23.570]  There's already a beautiful infographic that helps with that, that the Pueblo Pope did.
[47:24.570 --> 47:25.570]  They've been doing some amazing cannabis reporting.
[47:26.570 --> 47:27.570]  Is that John Rodriguez?
[47:28.570 --> 47:33.570]  Lisa Wheeler, and I don't know the other reporter's name, have been doing that.
[47:33.570 --> 47:38.570]  Okay. Well, thanks Lisa Wheeler and your colleague who are helping us out in the cannabis fight.
[47:39.570 --> 47:42.570]  Not so much that. It's just doing solid, honest reporting.
[47:43.570 --> 47:48.570]  And when that's done, it leans far to the pro-cannabis side because that's just the reality.
[47:49.570 --> 47:52.570]  You can't be a good reporter and not end up reporting that.
[47:53.570 --> 47:54.570]  Truth.
[47:55.570 --> 47:58.570]  But know the issues in your area. It's not that difficult.
[47:59.570 --> 48:01.570]  It doesn't take that much time, and it's incredibly important, folks.
[48:01.570 --> 48:02.570]  Get out and do it.
[48:03.570 --> 48:05.570]  Mike always knows what's up. He's always got the right thing to say.
[48:06.570 --> 48:11.570]  If you're listening and you're in the industry, you should think about some sort of show up with your I voted sticker.
[48:12.570 --> 48:13.570]  Get a dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[48:14.570 --> 48:15.570]  You hear that?
[48:16.570 --> 48:17.570]  Think about it. Awesome promotion.
[48:18.570 --> 48:24.570]  Owners, store managers, people that voted, get a something like a percentage off today, a free pre-roll if you spend something.
[48:25.570 --> 48:28.570]  I don't know. Go vote. Go to the dispensary and celebrate your freedoms.
[48:28.570 --> 48:32.570]  Hey, Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out. I know you got that little guy at home. I know you want to go hang out with him.
[48:33.570 --> 48:39.570]  Yeah, man. It'll be good to get home, but I love the podcast. I'm happy to get over here, and I love doing it.
[48:40.570 --> 48:44.570]  Thanks for coming on, bro. I love having you on the show. You're always good material. The people love it when you ramble.
[48:45.570 --> 48:46.570]  You always bring good content.
[48:47.570 --> 48:51.570]  You guys, the next episode I have planned, well, I don't even know if I should talk about Jesse coming.
[48:52.570 --> 48:55.570]  Jesse says he's going to come over tomorrow. Mike might go pick him up and make sure he shows up.
[48:56.570 --> 48:57.570]  We want to make sure that happens.
[48:58.570 --> 49:04.570]  The next will either be myself and Mike or Jesse and myself or myself, Mike, and Jesse. You never know how it's going to go in these parts.
[49:05.570 --> 49:08.570]  There may or may not be a podcast recorded tomorrow. It may or may not be epic.
[49:09.570 --> 49:14.570]  It's outdoor season, so you never know what could go on right now, but I hope to have Jesse on tomorrow. Mike, you know you're invited back.
[49:15.570 --> 49:19.570]  Then after that, you guys, I will be recording once again with the Dabbing Granny. I can't wait to have her back on the show.
[49:20.570 --> 49:26.570]  It's tentatively scheduled. That's the intro about the gear. We're test running everything to make sure that this goes smooth this time, folks.
[49:26.570 --> 49:30.570]  We're 48 minutes in of this part of the recording and everything's looking like it works.
[49:31.570 --> 49:32.570]  Things look good.
[49:33.570 --> 49:34.570]  Yes, it looks good so far. So far, so good.
[49:35.570 --> 49:36.570]  All right, let's quit while we're ahead. Mike, thanks for coming.
[49:37.570 --> 49:43.570]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up this part of the show and I'll be back in just a jingle and I'll put a bow on this bitch.
[49:44.570 --> 49:48.570]  All right, everybody, I want to thank you guys for listening to another episode. I want to thank Mike for coming and joining me.
[49:49.570 --> 49:54.570]  You guys, I owe a huge shout out to my friend, Chris Baker. Make sure you listen to the Broadcast Geeks podcast and support my buddy, Baker.

[51:10.570 --> 51:14.570]  And then episode 150 will feature the dabbing granny. We're going to do that one again.
[51:15.570 --> 51:20.570]  So, join me for those. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.360]  I'm
[52:40.360 --> 52:42.360]  in
[52:44.360 --> 52:46.360]  for the
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.360]  children
[52:50.360 --> 52:52.360]  .
[53:15.050 --> 53:17.050]  We need you now more than ever.
[53:18.050 --> 53:20.050]  War in the street again.
[53:21.050 --> 53:25.990]  People are fighting.
[53:25.990 --> 53:27.990]  I said too much.
[53:42.800 --> 53:46.520]  You can't let's get
[53:47.520 --> 53:59.630]  more.
[54:00.630 --> 54:10.680]  You can't let's
[54:11.680 --> 55:08.500]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 149 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[55:09.500 --> 55:11.500]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[55:12.500 --> 55:16.500]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the cannabis world,
[55:17.500 --> 55:19.500]  you're in for a great time.
[55:19.500 --> 55:21.500]  This, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[55:22.500 --> 55:24.500]  I'm your host. My friends call me.
[55:25.500 --> 55:27.500]  Thank you once again for joining me.
[55:28.500 --> 55:30.500]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[55:31.500 --> 55:33.500]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire mystic roots crew.
[55:34.500 --> 55:36.500]  Yeah, I hope everybody's having a great week.
[55:37.500 --> 55:39.500]  I hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[55:40.500 --> 55:42.500]  I hope you got the email turned on.
[55:43.500 --> 55:45.500]  I hope you're taking a dab.
[55:46.500 --> 55:48.500]  I hope you're smoking some good shatters.
[55:49.500 --> 55:51.500]  Maybe some good live resin.
[55:52.500 --> 55:54.500]  Maybe you're smoking some rosin with me.
[55:55.500 --> 55:57.500]  Whatever you're smoking, I hope you're getting high as shit and having a good time with us.
[55:58.500 --> 56:00.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode features our good friends, White Mike and also Jesse Grose is back.
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.500]  We talk about a little bit of outdoor growing.
[56:04.500 --> 56:06.500]  We talk about a whole bunch of randomness.
[56:07.500 --> 56:09.500]  This is a really wonderful episode in my opinion.
[56:10.500 --> 56:12.500]  You guys, I did drop a Thursday episode.
[56:13.500 --> 56:15.500]  If you didn't catch the episode that came out on Thursday, make sure you go back and check that one out.
[56:16.500 --> 56:18.500]  Number 148 is available. It came out Thursday.
[56:19.500 --> 56:21.500]  I felt like I could put one out on Thursday for you.
[56:22.500 --> 56:24.500]  I hope you listened. I hope you enjoyed it.
[56:25.500 --> 56:27.500]  Send me a tweet. Let me know what you thought of that episode.

[56:31.500 --> 56:33.500]  You guys, I'm going to let the music play.

[56:37.500 --> 56:41.350]  Enjoy the music for a moment.
[56:42.350 --> 56:44.350]  Do it, Mike. You want to bust a freestyle?
[56:45.350 --> 56:47.350]  It looks like you're about to let one go.
[56:48.350 --> 56:50.350]  I want to hear a freestyle rap.
[56:51.350 --> 56:53.350]  City Council. City Council.
[56:54.350 --> 56:56.350]  Talk about City Council. City Council.
[56:57.350 --> 56:59.350]  Make sure you register to vote. City Council. City Council.
[57:00.350 --> 57:02.350]  Slinging the Texans.
[57:03.350 --> 57:05.350]  I have press record, you guys. We are recording at this podcast.
[57:06.350 --> 57:08.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to episode number 149.
[57:09.350 --> 57:11.350]  As promised, sitting to the left of me is a repeat offender, a returning champion.
[57:12.350 --> 57:14.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast. Our good buddy, Jesse Grose.
[57:15.350 --> 57:17.350]  Welcome back, bro. Hey, what's up?
[57:18.350 --> 57:20.350]  You guys, Jesse showed up with Raw Terps today.
[57:21.350 --> 57:23.350]  He's got some shit. He's got some shatter.
[57:24.350 --> 57:26.350]  He's locked and loaded and ready to go. Bro, thanks for showing up ready.
[57:27.350 --> 57:29.350]  For sure. Yeah.
[57:30.350 --> 57:32.350]  You got to use your microphone voice. Sorry, I interrupted him.
[57:33.350 --> 57:35.350]  He was about to take a drink of that Frosty Cool Brew of beer and I started talking to him.
[57:36.350 --> 57:38.350]  The Cottonmouth Killer. Yeah. Speaking of Cottonmouth, we are taking some serious dabs here today.
[57:39.350 --> 57:44.350]  Jesse, before we get too far, tell everybody on social media how they can stalk you while they listen to your sexy voice.
[57:45.350 --> 57:47.350]  Instagram, Jesse Grose.
[57:47.350 --> 57:49.350]  And then also you can check out my podcast.
[57:50.350 --> 57:54.350]  We've got a Facebook page, Colorado Podcast on Facebook.
[57:55.350 --> 57:57.350]  The Colorado Podcast. You guys make sure you check that out. Support that. It's a great show.
[57:58.350 --> 58:00.350]  I've been on that show. Big shout out to Mick the Dog.
[58:01.350 --> 58:02.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mick the Dog will be joining us also on this podcast.
[58:03.350 --> 58:05.350]  Right now, he's taking a comfy seat underneath the table.
[58:06.350 --> 58:08.350]  If you're a regular listener, you know the other day I kicked the dog. I apologize.
[58:09.350 --> 58:11.350]  I did not mean to do that. Jesse, thanks for joining us.
[58:12.350 --> 58:14.350]  Everybody, make sure you follow at Jesse Grose on Instagram.
[58:14.350 --> 58:16.350]  Take a look at his photography while you're listening to the show.
[58:17.350 --> 58:19.350]  Check him out. See what he does. We're going to talk a whole lot about outdoor growing.
[58:20.350 --> 58:23.350]  You guys also across the table from me, another repeat offender, a returning champion,
[58:24.350 --> 58:26.350]  the guy that was here just last night recording a show with me. I missed you, bro.
[58:27.350 --> 58:28.350]  Welcome back, Mike. What's up, everybody?
[58:29.350 --> 58:32.350]  White Mike is on the podcast. If you're not a regular listener, you can check Mike out.
[58:33.350 --> 58:35.350]  He's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[58:36.350 --> 58:39.350]  And he is also Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[58:40.350 --> 58:41.350]  Make sure you check out that group page. Did I get that right?
[58:41.350 --> 58:42.350]  Perfect. I've been trying to train that in my brain.
[58:43.350 --> 58:44.350]  That's a lot of words for my stoner brain.
[58:45.350 --> 58:47.350]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[58:48.350 --> 58:50.350]  If you've got enough of your own social media in your head, remembering someone else is, thanks, man.
[58:51.350 --> 58:53.350]  For sure, man. Thanks for doing that for us. I told you on the last episode.
[58:54.350 --> 58:56.350]  We need you out there fighting that part of the fight.
[58:57.350 --> 58:59.350]  I'll do the breeding. Jesse will do the growing. You get us legal. Fight for us.
[59:00.350 --> 59:01.350]  Welcome back to the show, bro. I appreciate having you here.
[59:02.350 --> 59:03.350]  Thanks, man.
[59:04.350 --> 59:05.350]  Taking time away from the baby, the family, the dogs. You're a busy dude.
[59:06.350 --> 59:07.350]  It's great to have you here. You were supposed to trim all night,
[59:08.350 --> 59:09.350]  so I'm glad that you ended up not trimming.
[59:09.350 --> 59:10.350]  I was. I ended up trimming all night, and then that got waved off.
[59:11.350 --> 59:12.350]  So, yeah. Back for the podcast. I love it.
[59:13.350 --> 59:14.350]  Shut up.
[59:15.350 --> 59:16.350]  I was hoping to be here with Jesse finally.
[59:17.350 --> 59:18.350]  Hell yeah.
[59:19.350 --> 59:20.350]  This is a first.
[59:21.350 --> 59:22.350]  I was going to say.
[59:23.350 --> 59:24.350]  We've done celebratories, haven't we?
[59:25.350 --> 59:26.350]  Yeah, like 50 and 100. I think you're both here for those.
[59:27.350 --> 59:28.350]  Yeah. I think we did one before, too.
[59:29.350 --> 59:30.350]  I met you at this table doing a podcast.
[59:31.350 --> 59:32.350]  That's how many I've done. I dabbed that memory away completely.
[59:33.350 --> 59:34.350]  It's hard to remember some of those early, early episodes.
[59:35.350 --> 59:36.350]  Right. They're foggy and foggy.
[59:36.350 --> 59:37.350]  In my head, people remind me of things I've said and done on those episodes.
[59:38.350 --> 59:39.350]  I'm like, wow, that happened.
[59:40.350 --> 59:41.350]  Yeah.
[59:42.350 --> 59:43.350]  Way to burst the balloon. I've been toting around all day, bud.
[59:44.350 --> 59:45.350]  Sorry.
[59:46.350 --> 59:47.350]  Well, hey, this is the first meaningful one. How about that?
[59:48.350 --> 59:49.350]  Right. The first to grow oriented one.
[59:50.350 --> 59:51.350]  This is episode 149, you guys.
[59:52.350 --> 59:53.350]  Yeah.
[59:54.350 --> 59:55.350]  149 episodes into this podcast.
[59:56.350 --> 59:57.350]  I haven't missed a week in two and a half years.
[59:58.350 --> 59:59.350]  Every Monday, you guys have had a podcast to listen to,
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.350]  and some Thursdays.
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:03.350]  It's been incredible.
[01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:05.350]  I've been doing a lot of stuff.
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.350]  I've been running 20 episodes.
[01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:09.350]  Nice.
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.350]  Tomorrow, actually.
[01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:13.350]  Tomorrow will be your 20th?
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.350]  I was honored to be on one of those episodes.
[01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.350]  We did a, I call it a swap cast.
[01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.350]  I learned the phrase swap cast from Doug Stanhope.
[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.350]  It's when two podcasters come together and record one podcast,
[01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:23.350]  and then they both put it up on their feed
[01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:25.350]  so that everybody gets exposed to both shows at the same time.
[01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:27.350]  I did one of those with the Colorado podcast.
[01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:29.350]  Make sure you check it out.
[01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.350]  It was good fun.
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:33.350]  It's a little bit of chaos, but it is a great show.
[01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:35.350]  Listen to it on their feed so that they get the clicks, you guys.
[01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.350]  Go to the Colorado podcast page and listen to that episode
[01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.350]  on their feed because they could use the traffic.
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:41.350]  We've actually got some internet problems
[01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.350]  or some website problems at the moment,
[01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:45.350]  so I'm not sure they'll be able to find that one.
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:47.350]  Uh-oh, tech difficulties, mate.
[01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.350]  Well, this episode won't come out for a few days,
[01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.350]  so hopefully you've got that resolved by then, bro.
[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.350]  Hopefully your tech guy is on it.
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.350]  If not, I know a guy that'll work on that one for you.
[01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:57.350]  All right.
[01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.350]  I was going to say I'm excited because episode 150,
[01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.350]  it has been confirmed.
[01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:03.350]  Episode 150 is going to feature the Dabbing Granny once again.
[01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.350]  I know I recorded the episode before,
[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.350]  I'm still heartbroken that it failed.
[01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:09.350]  Everyone has been real supportive and encouraging.
[01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:11.350]  Everyone's all about coming back
[01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.350]  and rerecording that podcast.
[01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:15.350]  Dabbing Granny went and bought special hash
[01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:17.350]  to smoke with me to show me
[01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.350]  that she doesn't mind doing it again.
[01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.350]  I love it.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.350]  Tomorrow night at a secret location,
[01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.350]  I will be recording with the Dabbing Granny.
[01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.350]  You guys, it'll be at the Cannon Canyon.
[01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.350]  By the time this goes out, it'll be too late
[01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.350]  for anyone to show up and harass us.
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:33.350]  Tomorrow night at the Cannon Canyon,
[01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:35.350]  it'll be myself, Dabbing Granny,
[01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.350]  and Camille will be there.
[01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:39.350]  Hopefully, Aaron will be there.
[01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.350]  Hopefully, Biddy and Sirius will be there.
[01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:43.350]  I'm not even going to try to mimic the show we did last time.
[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.350]  That's bullshit to try to do.
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.350]  There will be things that get left behind.
[01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:49.350]  We're just going to have a conversation like we do.
[01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:51.350]  Some of that is lost forever
[01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.350]  unless you find it on Dabbing Granny's social feed.
[01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.350]  It was Dabbing Granny's first podcast
[01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:57.350]  and she wasn't sure how to go about it right away.
[01:01:58.350 --> 01:01:59.350]  Now, she is completely fucking comfortable
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.350]  and she knows what to do on a podcast.
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.350]  It was a practice run, you guys.
[01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:05.350]  150 will be the Dabbing Granny.
[01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.350]  We're going to talk about outdoor growing, you guys.
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.350]  I want to talk about these Dabs, this Distillate,
[01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.350]  and these Terps, though, bro.
[01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.350]  You showed up with some delicious shit, Jesse.
[01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.350]  Remind me what's in each of these little vials you got here.
[01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:18.350]  We got Critical Mass.
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.350]  Critical Mass Terps.
[01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.350]  Distillate.
[01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:24.350]  Raw Distillate.
[01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.350]  This is the OVM.
[01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:28.350]  OVM Orange Vanilla Milano.
[01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.350]  Orange Vanilla Milano.
[01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.350]  Shout out to the Garden of Weden
[01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:34.350]  for an amazing breeding project.
[01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.350]  That strain came out amazing.
[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.350]  Yeah, I could tell him.
[01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:39.350]  I had 12 females of it,
[01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:41.350]  so I don't know how much he's grown it out,
[01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.350]  but I could tell him a little about it.
[01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:45.350]  I could use a pack of those, Spence.
[01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.350]  Nice.
[01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:49.350]  I could use some of them.
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.350]  And then what's this last one here?
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:53.350]  That is Gorilla Glue.
[01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:55.350]  Gorilla Glue Raw Terps.
[01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.350]  So, you guys, they have figured out
[01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.350]  how to take a plant, a cannabis plant,
[01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.350]  probably takes more than one plant,
[01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:03.350]  but take a large batch of cannabis
[01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:05.350]  and put it on the plant,
[01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.350]  and then you can get the essence,
[01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.350]  the flavor, the aroma, the taste,
[01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:11.350]  and get it all in your face
[01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.350]  and all in your palate
[01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:15.350]  just with one little droplet on a dab,
[01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:17.350]  and it's amazing.
[01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:19.350]  It can actually be overwhelming.
[01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.350]  We've learned that some require
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.350]  far, far less than a droplet.
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:25.350]  Durban Poison dabs?
[01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:27.350]  Very, very little.
[01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:29.350]  Very little.
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:31.350]  I overdone it on some that I took the other night,
[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.350]  and it was just too much.
[01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:35.350]  It was really overwhelming.
[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.350]  I really think the terpenes
[01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:39.350]  are really contributing to my high also.
[01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.350]  It makes me skyrocket to that next level.
[01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:43.350]  That became crystal clear
[01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:45.350]  when I started playing with the distillate and the terps.
[01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.350]  You're taking the same THC material,
[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:49.350]  and when you add it to something like
[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.350]  the Critical Mass,
[01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.350]  you go one way hard.
[01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:55.350]  When you add it to something like the Durban,
[01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:57.350]  you go the other way real hard.
[01:03:58.350 --> 01:03:59.350]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:01.350]  And you're not changing the THC content.
[01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.350]  Right.
[01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.350]  It's really shaped that eye.
[01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.350]  That entourage effect.
[01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:09.350]  The symbolic effect.
[01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.350]  What Gupta talked about.
[01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:13.350]  It's exactly evident,
[01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.350]  and when we're using the terps like this,
[01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.350]  yeah, good job.
[01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.350]  I know your company is experimenting.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:21.350]  Give your company a shout out
[01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:23.350]  so we can hype them up a little bit.
[01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:25.350]  It's the Uncle Bud Company.
[01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:27.350]  The Uncle Bud Company based in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.350]  We are pulling raw terps out here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:31.350]  With no THC in them.
[01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:33.350]  Zero THC in these terpenoids?
[01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:35.350]  If you're going to do this, don't fucking ask.
[01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:37.350]  Hypothetically, we could make these available nationwide
[01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:39.350]  because there are no cannabinoids in there.
[01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:41.350]  Yes.
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.350]  Awesome.
[01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:45.350]  Diverting it out of metric is a whole other story.
[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:47.350]  Right, right.
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.350]  Making them...
[01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:51.350]  It's virtually impossible for that to leave
[01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:53.350]  the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Tracking System.
[01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:55.350]  That is stuck.
[01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:57.350]  You're not going to get it, you guys.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:59.350]  As a consumer, if you purchase it in a store,
[01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:01.350]  if there's no THC in it, can it travel?
[01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:03.350]  Yes.
[01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.350]  That was also my assumption.
[01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.350]  Because there's nothing...
[01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.350]  That's terpenoids.
[01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:11.350]  Terpenoids are not illegal.
[01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:13.350]  Cannabinoids.
[01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:15.350]  It's not a little glass vial.
[01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.350]  You're going to spend a lot of time explaining that.
[01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:19.350]  It just smells like weed.
[01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.350]  Officer, stop hating me.
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.350]  Go to Vitamin Cottage, get yourself some fucking...
[01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:25.350]  Theoretically, it's also legal to ship in the mail.
[01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:27.350]  I wasn't going to go there.
[01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:29.350]  But yeah, theoretically, since it's just terpenoids,
[01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:31.350]  you can buy terpenoids.
[01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.350]  Vials of liquid in the mail,
[01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.350]  I wouldn't, folks.
[01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.350]  But if there's really no THC in it,
[01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:39.350]  I think there's a loop here to be played with if necessary.
[01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:41.350]  There's actually a...
[01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:43.350]  Whoa, my mic got too hot.
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.350]  There's a website called JustTerps.com
[01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.350]  or something similar to that
[01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:49.350]  where you can purchase terpenoids.
[01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:51.350]  You can buy limonene,
[01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:53.350]  you can buy all of the terpenoids separately.
[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.350]  Is that the big pretty wheel I've seen?
[01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:57.350]  Probably.
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:05:59.350]  But those terps are not derived from cannabis.
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.350]  Those are pulled from things like bananas
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.350]  and roses and oranges and other fruits.
[01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:05.350]  So, I think people who don't really like
[01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:07.350]  to be cannabis would be able...
[01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.350]  They'd have to get some dabs or some distillate
[01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:11.350]  or something to carry it.
[01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:13.350]  You could probably put this in a vape pen cartridge.
[01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.350]  You can mix that up with some VG,
[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.350]  some vegetable glycol or something.
[01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:19.350]  All day long.
[01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:21.350]  We've tried it.
[01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:23.350]  Yeah, see?
[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.350]  It's actually pretty amazing.
[01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.350]  It makes vaping a little less gay.
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.350]  I wasn't going to go there about it.
[01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:33.350]  But yeah, you could put that in a vape pen
[01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:35.350]  and get a lemon OG or lemon G.
[01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:37.350]  That lemon G, you guys.
[01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:39.350]  People do crazy shit for me for the lemon G.
[01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.350]  They'll stare at you like,
[01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:43.350]  can I get one of them lemon G dabs?
[01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.350]  They look like they got them white lips.
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.350]  I'm here for the Friday five o'clock
[01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.350]  free lemon G dab giveaway.
[01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.350]  They got VCRs and shit in their hand for it.
[01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.350]  Something about the lemon G terps are amazing.
[01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:55.350]  I had OG Kush terps.
[01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.350]  There's Paradigm terps floating around here somewhere.
[01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.350]  It's so delicious to taste these cannabis terpenes.
[01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.350]  We're getting spoiled.
[01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.350]  It's actually...
[01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.350]  It's really not that hard to extract them either.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:07.350]  It's just the right equipment and the right knowledge.
[01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:09.350]  Yeah.
[01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:11.350]  I was going to say,
[01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:13.350]  tell us what you feel comfortable sharing.
[01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:15.350]  I don't want to pry too much information out of you,
[01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.350]  but if there's something you want to tell us
[01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.350]  that we would love to know some of your process.
[01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:21.350]  I'll tell you this.
[01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:23.350]  If you get with me and give me a hundred bucks,
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.350]  I'll walk you through the entire process.
[01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:27.350]  A hundred bucks.
[01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:29.350]  I can even...
[01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:31.350]  I've already proven I can do it.
[01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:33.350]  I taught Ross DeSeb how to do it over Facebook.
[01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.350]  I'm not going to pay you just for showing up.
[01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:37.350]  For sure.
[01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:39.350]  250 bucks.
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.350]  It takes an investment in equipment.
[01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.350]  How much would the equipment cost for a small operation?
[01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.350]  Maybe I had five pounds of plant material to run.
[01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:49.350]  How much equipment should I buy?
[01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.350]  What would I be spending for a five pound run?
[01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.350]  Good equipment, you're looking about 600 bucks.
[01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:56.350]  You're going to be doing five runs
[01:07:57.350 --> 01:07:58.350]  instead of one five pound run.
[01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.350]  Okay.
[01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:02.350]  About a pound at a time and it's 600 bucks in equipment.
[01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:03.350]  Yeah.
[01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:05.350]  You want to go to the store?
[01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.350]  We can do it on the internet.
[01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.350]  And I got the hundred bucks
[01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:11.350]  so that you could teach me how to do it.
[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.350]  It's next week's episode.
[01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:15.350]  We're going to order a bunch of stuff.
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:17.350]  Yeah, the next episode you're going to come back
[01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:19.350]  and I'm just be sitting here covered in turps.
[01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.350]  I spilled some and I don't care.
[01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.350]  It's a solventless process, completely and totally organic.
[01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.350]  It takes a little bit of a chemistry background or...
[01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:27.350]  I know that guy.
[01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.350]  Or you just need to know someone
[01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.350]  who can walk you through the process.
[01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:33.350]  Between you and Brett Maverick,
[01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:35.350]  I should be able to figure it out.
[01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.350]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:39.350]  Shout out to Brett Maverick.
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.350]  Like I said, I taught Seb how to do it.
[01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.350]  Shout out to Rasta Seb also, by the way.
[01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:45.350]  Just a quick shout out.
[01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:47.350]  I don't know if I'm ready to answer
[01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.350]  your Facebook messages yet, bro,
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.350]  but shout out on the show.
[01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:53.350]  Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.350]  I'm over it.
[01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:57.350]  I'm just not ready to interact yet.
[01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.350]  Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:01.350]  I brought Jesse on the show
[01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.350]  and I'm putting a lot of pressure on you, bro.
[01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.350]  My outdoor expert.
[01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.350]  Ouch.
[01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.350]  That means I don't know a lot of outdoor growers.
[01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.350]  Oh, come on.
[01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.350]  No, no, no.
[01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.350]  You're reliable.
[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.350]  The previous outdoor grow episodes
[01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:19.350]  that Jesse's done with you
[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:21.350]  have been some of my favorites.
[01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.350]  If I were you at home, I'd get a notepad and a pen.
[01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.350]  John Randall Jr., get out a notepad and a pen, buddy.
[01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:27.350]  I know you're taking notes right there.
[01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:29.350]  Put down the Pokemon Go, buddy.
[01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:31.350]  It's time to take some notes about the grow.
[01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.350]  Randall's, we love you, bro.
[01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:35.350]  Outdoor growing.
[01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.350]  You guys are probably about three weeks into flower.
[01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:39.350]  You should start seeing the pistils.
[01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.350]  The calyx pistils are starting to form on your plants.
[01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.350]  Those little, you guys call them hairs.
[01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:45.350]  The white hairs, those are popping up on your plants.
[01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:47.350]  If you've got girls, those are popping up.
[01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.350]  Something super important and hypercritical.
[01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:53.350]  Your boy plants need to be fucking pulled by now.
[01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:55.350]  Walk through your garden.
[01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:57.350]  Look for boys.
[01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.350]  Look for hermaphrodites.
[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:01.350]  Get rid of that shit because how far can pollen travel?
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:03.350]  A hundred miles or so?
[01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:05.350]  Very far.
[01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:07.350]  I don't want everybody's crop getting pollinated because you're ...
[01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:09.350]  Wow, excuse me.
[01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:11.350]  I just let out a full solid burp on the podcast.
[01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:13.350]  I was red.
[01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:15.350]  I don't need everybody's crop getting pollinated because you're too lazy to pull a male plant out of your garden.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.350]  Go outside, pull the male plants.
[01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.350]  If you haven't already done it, you might be fucking up already.
[01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.350]  I talked about it on another episode of how quickly male plants drop pollen.
[01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:25.350]  I've got a male plant in another room right over there.
[01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:28.350]  He is 15 days in and he is just blasting pollen right now.
[01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.350]  It only takes 15 or 16 days for serious shit to happen.
[01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.350]  It takes trouble to start happening.
[01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:35.350]  It doesn't take long.
[01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:45.350]  I've known an amateur breeder that pollinated his neighbor's grow that was, let's say, 400, 500 feet away.
[01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:47.350]  Oh, man.
[01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:50.350]  With trees, fences, houses, all kinds of stuff in between.
[01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:52.350]  Oh, pollen is amazing.
[01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.350]  It's whole purpose of life is to just land on the female plant and climb up that pistol and get up in there.
[01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.350]  It wants to get in the ovule.
[01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:13.350]  There's a couple of places that have passed special rules keeping hemp and marijuana grows five or six miles away just to make sure that there's never a legal war between the big hemp field and the big marijuana field.
[01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:15.350]  I totally know a solution to that.
[01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:21.350]  I would grow my sensamilia grow right next to a hemp field.
[01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.350]  Are you willing to expose your secret on the podcast?
[01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:26.350]  I think I know you.
[01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:27.350]  By the way, you told me.
[01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.350]  Will you tell us on the show or do you want to keep that a secret?
[01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.350]  Hemp plants only release pollen once a year.
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:34.350]  Oh, okay.
[01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:38.350]  Plan your bloom cycles accordingly.
[01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:40.350]  If you can.
[01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:42.350]  Yeah.
[01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.350]  Also, most hemp growers like to grow from cloud.
[01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:52.350]  There's significant other ways you can protect your own grow from the guy next door who doesn't know the difference between a male and a female.
[01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.350]  It's part of the planning and the research you should have done by now.
[01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:58.350]  Or he should have done.
[01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:00.350]  He should not have a male out there outside in the first place.
[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.350]  I actually know a couple of breeders in California that do everything outdoors and I just shake my heads at them.
[01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.350]  I'm like, you shouldn't be doing that, bro.
[01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:09.350]  You'll be getting buds right about now.
[01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.350]  You'll start seeing the bud sites.
[01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:13.350]  It's time to get in there and kind of take off that lower shit.
[01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:15.350]  Yeah, totally screwed them up.
[01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:17.350]  Yeah, screwed them up.
[01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:19.350]  Shave the legs in there.
[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.350]  Get that stuff getting in something where like a little squirrel could get help climbing up the little ladder at the bottom.
[01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:24.350]  Take that off of there.
[01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:26.350]  All that stuff that's going to hang down and touch the dirt.
[01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:28.350]  Get rid of that.
[01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.350]  All those little sucker branches, just a little thin pale yellow branches that are just shooting up.
[01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.350]  Take all those off.
[01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.350]  You don't need those.
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.350]  Go clean up the inside a little bit.
[01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:40.350]  You want to focus on the tops of the plants.
[01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:42.350]  That's where all the magic is going to happen.
[01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.350]  So clean them up a little bit.
[01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:46.350]  Hollow them out.
[01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:48.350]  Yeah, hollow them out a little bit.
[01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.350]  If you can't get the sun properly, feel free to do it.
[01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:52.350]  They can take a beating.
[01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.350]  Go out into your grow around noon, one o'clock when the sun's really high in the sky.
[01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:02.350]  And everything that's not getting direct sunlight right then and there.
[01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:08.350]  Use that as a guide of what to take off.
[01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:18.350]  Not everything's going to be getting full sunlight, but things that are just in the dark at the bottom, you can take that off.
[01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:27.350]  Things that are a little further down the side, or bud sites that are further down the side, they may not be getting full sunlight, but they're still getting sunlight.
[01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.350]  Leave those there.
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:31.350]  So just judge accordingly.
[01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:34.350]  All that dark stuff, you can definitely take that off.
[01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:36.350]  This one's going to be larfy.
[01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:39.350]  Yeah, and you don't want to trim that, unless you're making a bunch of hash.
[01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.350]  And then maybe leave that if you want to, but it's going to take away from the energy up top.
[01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:47.350]  So stretch phase should be just about over, right?
[01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.350]  About the first three weeks, we really start stretching.
[01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:53.350]  That should be slowing down now, so we can see how big our plants are actually going to be.
[01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:58.350]  Kind of get a judgment of how tall they're going to be, how much panicking you need to do on readjusting that fence.
[01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:00.350]  Because a lot of people, I know some people that are...
[01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.350]  We're building that second trellis.
[01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:06.350]  Yeah, well, people are growing crazy outdoor plants here in Pueblo, and it's completely illegal to grow outside in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.350]  It is banned, but there are people that are doing it, and they're just building a higher fence every week.
[01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:11.350]  I see them, like, had to put more plywood up.
[01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:13.350]  I spotted another one today.
[01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:20.350]  There was an old school giant back TV set propped against a gate on the outside of the target place, and I about died laughing.
[01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:22.350]  That's that time of year, you guys.
[01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.350]  It's going to be all over Pueblo.
[01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:28.350]  You guys, if you're growing outdoors this year and someone tries to steal your shit, don't fucking shoot them.
[01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:30.350]  Grow more weed next year.
[01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:32.350]  I hate that we have to do this episode every year, but it's just weed.
[01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:34.350]  Just let it go.
[01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.350]  Yeah, it's happened here, though.
[01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:40.350]  Somebody got shot trying to steal somebody's cannabis outdoors, and that medicine that was supposed to be medicine became a target of theft,
[01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:43.350]  which became an attempted homicide, which, fuck that.
[01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.350]  We don't need that vibe attached to this plant at all.
[01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.350]  That's why we tried to make it legal.
[01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.350]  That's why we wanted it safely accessible, so nobody's getting shot over this shit.
[01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:53.350]  We took it away from the cartels, put it in the hands of the medical community.
[01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:55.350]  Let's do it right, you guys.
[01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:57.350]  It is not justifiable.
[01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:02.350]  It instantly makes it into a criminal element or a criminal act.
[01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:04.350]  A criminal enterprise?
[01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.350]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.350]  Now you're protecting your illegal crop.
[01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:09.350]  Yeah.
[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.350]  Guys, if you're listening to this, you're probably not going to shoot anybody.
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.350]  You're all peaceful, cool-ass people, is why you're listening to my show.
[01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:15.350]  Yep.
[01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:17.350]  So stretch phases over.
[01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.350]  You're going to start seeing what size the plants are.
[01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.350]  Don't top.
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.350]  Don't top anymore.
[01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:25.350]  I'm glad that's one of the next things I had written down, is no more topping.
[01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:30.350]  The hormones in the plants have all decided where the tops of those plants are going to be and where they need to bake the most energy, where they need to send the THC, where they need to send all the energy for budding.
[01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:32.350]  Quit topping them.
[01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.350]  No more topping.
[01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.350]  You can kind of bend them.
[01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:38.350]  You can stretch them down, but don't cut any more off the tops of the plants.
[01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:40.350]  But the tops where the hormones have climbed up, don't take that off of there.
[01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:42.350]  No more topping.
[01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.350]  Is it time now to adjust the nutrients that we're feeding them?
[01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:48.350]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:50.350]  Probably, you know, especially by the time this comes out.
[01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:54.350]  But yeah, last week, most definitely now.
[01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.350]  But yeah, go for it.
[01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.350]  We can put this out.
[01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:00.350]  We can put this out Monday morning.
[01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:06.350]  Outdoor plants, they'll use a little more nitrogen than indoor plants will through the bloom cycle.
[01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:11.350]  So keep that in mind, you know, keep that bottle of bloom or I mean bottle of grow around.
[01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:26.350]  The way I do it is I'd probably just, if I felt they need a little extra nitrogen shot, I just mix up some grow and maybe a little cow mag and feed that in addition to the normal feed.
[01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.350]  Okay.
[01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.350]  So add it on top of what you're normally feeding.
[01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:35.350]  You know, I saw Subcool take a bottle of nutrients and pour it directly into the plant.
[01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:39.350]  Directly onto the soil on his outdoor grow and then just watered it in.
[01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:44.350]  I wouldn't recommend that, but I saw that shit and it made me shake my head like Subcool really did that, bro?
[01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.350]  Like one of the most reputable growers you could find on the internet.
[01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:53.350]  And that dude just poured a bottle of a nutrient I won't even use straight onto the dirt and then watered it in.
[01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.350]  It'll be just fine.
[01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.350]  You know, Subcool's kind of from the south a little bit.
[01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:00.350]  He's got that southern flavor to him, so he doesn't give two shits most of the time.
[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.350]  I'll hold my tongue on this.
[01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:04.350]  Yeah.
[01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:05.350]  All right.
[01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:06.350]  It's time to adjust the feed.
[01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.350]  You might want to keep...
[01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:09.350]  Jesse made a really good point that I didn't think about.
[01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.350]  These outdoor plants are going to use a little more nitrogen than what we're used to.
[01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:13.350]  So increase your nitrogen feed.
[01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:19.350]  If you're not going to be a bottle fed nutrient kind of guy, what kind of stuff can we add to top dress to get a little more nitrogen in there?
[01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:21.350]  Yeah, now we're talking.
[01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.350]  Right up your alley.
[01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.350]  Some Neem Mill.
[01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:30.350]  Seabird guano is a great all-purpose guano if that's your thing.
[01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:34.350]  I've quit using it, but I had a shit ton of it.
[01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.350]  So it's not going anywhere.
[01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:38.350]  I've got to use it up.
[01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.350]  I'm just not going to buy any more.
[01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:45.350]  But Seabird guano gives you PK and nitrogen, so it's a real good one.
[01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:53.350]  There's something about whatever they're eating, the fish and the kelp that's in that, I think that really adds to the flavor and the funky smell of good, cushy bud.
[01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:56.350]  I think kelp and Seabird guano really contribute.
[01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.350]  I love...
[01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:00.350]  Ocean products make the best tasting bud, in my opinion.
[01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:02.350]  I agree.
[01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:08.350]  I've done veganic, I've done the bone mills and blood mills, everything.
[01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:16.350]  And I love my little, my ocean style kelp and crab shell mill.
[01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:19.350]  Seabird guano works good with it.
[01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:23.350]  I like the product SeaPlex from Organicare.
[01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:25.350]  Nice.
[01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:29.350]  It's a cold pressed, blue algae based product.
[01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.350]  And it makes, I think it makes the buds taste better, smell better.
[01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:34.350]  They get more density.
[01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.350]  And I think there's something else in there that just makes them grow better.
[01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:41.350]  Whatever's happening in that kelp, that life that's in that kelp makes my plants happier.
[01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.350]  It definitely gives them a little boost.
[01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:47.350]  Kelp's the fastest growing plant on the face of the planet.
[01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:51.350]  So there's all kinds of natural PGRs going on there.
[01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:53.350]  Okay. It works.
[01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:54.350]  Cytotoxins and...
[01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:56.350]  Cytokinins.
[01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:58.350]  Yeah.
[01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:00.350]  Oxins and cytokinins.
[01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:02.350]  Yeah.
[01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:04.350]  Very, very happy plant food.
[01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:06.350]  Like I said, notepads.
[01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:09.350]  Yeah. Some of this stuff is not for everybody.
[01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:11.350]  So here's a quick little kelp.
[01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.350]  Kelp is also a great bloom booster.
[01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:21.350]  So you can take kelp, put it in a mason jar, say a quart mason jar, put a cup of kelp in there.
[01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:23.350]  Go ahead and top it off with water.
[01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:25.350]  Let it rehydrate for 24 hours.
[01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:30.350]  Strain any extra water away if there is a little bit.
[01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:36.350]  Run that kelp through your food processor and that'll turn it into just a mush.
[01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:45.350]  At that point, it dissolves into water and you can foliar spray it as a bloom booster right there on your plant.
[01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:47.350]  And then store it in your refrigerator.
[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.350]  In the back, keep it as cold as possible.
[01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:53.350]  That'll definitely make your plants happy.
[01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:56.350]  Would you add any fulvic acid to that spray?
[01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.350]  That wouldn't hurt a bit.
[01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:00.350]  Make it a little more absorbable?
[01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:04.350]  That's probably the recipe to a lot of organic gluten boosters on the market right there.
[01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:06.350]  A lot. A lot. Yeah.
[01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:09.350]  That's the key right there. Any foliar that you're spraying has got kelp in it.
[01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:11.350]  Is there silylic acid naturally in kelp like that?
[01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:13.350]  Is that where the silylic acid comes in?
[01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:17.350]  There's a little bit, but most of that, or the big source of that is aloe vera.
[01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:19.350]  That's really popular right now.
[01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.350]  You could easily add some aloe vera into that.
[01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:25.350]  Am I actually going to do that?
[01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.350]  That's a really good bloom booster. Thank you.
[01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.350]  We just made a new product. Let's fucking pad this shit.
[01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.350]  We all have no pads.
[01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:36.350]  You want me to write that down?
[01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:38.350]  That went up here. That went into my grower brain.
[01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:40.350]  That's in my grower brain.
[01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:44.350]  See, back in the day, we were taught not to take too many notes.
[01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:46.350]  Because if your door got kicked in and there were notes that said,
[01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:47.350]  feed on week six, feed on week seven,
[01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:49.350]  you just left a paper trail in your handwriting.
[01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:52.350]  You had to have those plants in there with no fucking notes and a good memory.
[01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:56.350]  Yep. Yeah. It was harder that time.
[01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:59.350]  So many things change in legalization.
[01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:03.350]  That's just one of the really nice ones that not everyone even gets to see.
[01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:08.350]  Fuck. I was scared to look at it on the internet even.
[01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:12.350]  Even to Google, or back then it was Yahoo or American Online.
[01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:15.350]  Were you part of overgrow.com?
[01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:19.350]  I was way too scared to ever ask questions or post on it,
[01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:21.350]  but I totally read the fucking content.
[01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:23.350]  Totally trolled it and looked at it. All right.
[01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:25.350]  Yeah. I used to go look and all that good stuff.
[01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:27.350]  I used to make up fake accounts on other sites and just go look like that
[01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.350]  before I was supposed to be doing it.
[01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:33.350]  Cannabis Culture Magazine had a really good one too,
[01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.350]  after they shut down overgrow.
[01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:37.350]  A lot of the people from there went.
[01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:41.350]  I got into the forums years later.
[01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:43.350]  When I got my med card, I was like, fuck this.
[01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:45.350]  Once I had my med card, I just game the fuck on.
[01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:48.350]  A lot of people may argue with me.
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:54.350]  I think that the OG Kush, the OG and OG Kush could be OG from overgrow.com.
[01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.350]  Because if you met somebody from overgrow, they just say,
[01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:59.350]  are you fucking Jesse from OG?
[01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:02.350]  Because you wouldn't want to say overgrow because if it wasn't you,
[01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:04.350]  then I mean I just fucked up. They'd be like, from what?
[01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:06.350]  Nevermind man, from this thing I do.
[01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:09.350]  So we just called it OG. Are you guys all on OG or what?
[01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.350]  I'm on overgrow.com.
[01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:13.350]  I think that people were shipping seeds around.
[01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:16.350]  One guy had a seed and he shipped some of them to Jesse.
[01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:19.350]  Then Jesse grew them and found the phenotype he liked and bred to that
[01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:21.350]  and then shipped those seeds to somebody.
[01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.350]  I think that somebody ended up with a bag of seeds
[01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:25.350]  and they called it the overgrow Kush.
[01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:27.350]  That could be completely fucking wrong.
[01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.350]  There's so many stories of where the OG Kush came from.
[01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:32.350]  That's one of the more plausible ones.
[01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:36.350]  That's kind of an adaptation of another one I've heard.
[01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:41.350]  That one and then the one that involves the Bubba Kush guy.
[01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:43.350]  Yeah, Matt from Florida coming out.
[01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.350]  That's kind of the same.
[01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:47.350]  I mean it kind of falls in there,
[01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:49.350]  but that's the two I tend to believe personally.
[01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:51.350]  Okay.
[01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:53.350]  Yeah, there are plenty of other stories of how that happened.
[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.350]  I won't even bring up the podcasts that I've heard them on.
[01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:59.350]  Having the OGs I have, yeah, I love OG.
[01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.350]  I love some good OG.
[01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:03.350]  My Jeff's OG has got some flavor to it.
[01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:05.350]  There'll be some Jeff's OGs coming out.
[01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:07.350]  We'll have some Jeff's OG available on the shelf
[01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.350]  at the store pretty soon here that John Randall Jr.
[01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:11.350]  trimmed up for us.
[01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:13.350]  It looks delicious.
[01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.350]  Nice.
[01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:17.350]  We're top dressing with nitrogen heavy products.
[01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:19.350]  How about some...
[01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:21.350]  Well, not, I mean, add them in there.
[01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.350]  Okay, add them in there.
[01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:25.350]  All right, but don't go too hard.
[01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:27.350]  Yeah, you want to hit hard with your Ps and Ks.
[01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:29.350]  Ps and Ks now.
[01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:31.350]  Yeah, and remember it takes a week to two weeks
[01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:33.350]  on a typical top dress for it to break down enough
[01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:35.350]  to be uptakeable by the plant.
[01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.350]  So, plan ahead.
[01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:39.350]  If you do it right now or in the morning,
[01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:41.350]  whatever it is,
[01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.350]  that's not going to really take effect
[01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:45.350]  for at least a week.
[01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:47.350]  So, think about that.
[01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:49.350]  So, if that plant is already yellowing,
[01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:51.350]  you're chasing it by now.
[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:53.350]  Yeah.
[01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:55.350]  So, you should have done more nitrogen already.
[01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.350]  So, next year do more.
[01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:59.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.350]  And I would still add nitrogen to keep it
[01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:03.350]  from getting worse.
[01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:05.350]  And that'll help your buds develop.
[01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:07.350]  Other top dresses though,
[01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:09.350]  Neem Mill is a favorite of mine.
[01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:11.350]  Crab Mill is good for blooming.
[01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:13.350]  And then, kelp.
[01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:15.350]  I mean, most organic bloom boosters
[01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:17.350]  are made out of kelp.
[01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:19.350]  So, that's really where you want to go.
[01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:21.350]  Do you mess with the Karanja meal?
[01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:23.350]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:25.350]  Yeah.
[01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:26.350]  Okay.
[01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:27.350]  That's the Neem Mill mix I use.
[01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:29.350]  It's 50-50.
[01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:31.350]  Okay, great mix.
[01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:33.350]  That'll keep most bugs out of the soil
[01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:35.350]  and keep most bugs out for the plants.
[01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:37.350]  And then, I have a question for you.
[01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:39.350]  Because at this point of the season,
[01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:41.350]  it's time to clean up a bunch of the leaves.
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:43.350]  Do you like to heavily defoliate
[01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:45.350]  or do you just kind of clean them up?
[01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:47.350]  I'm more of a clean up guy.
[01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:49.350]  Yeah.
[01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:51.350]  On outdoors.
[01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:53.350]  I get in there and clean them the fuck up
[01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:55.350]  on an inorgra.
[01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.350]  I'll take off a lot of leaves to where people
[01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:59.350]  look at you like you're crazy,
[01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:01.350]  but then they come back a week,
[01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:03.350]  10 days later and all the leaves are back
[01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.350]  and they can't even tell.
[01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:07.350]  They're not the same size.
[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.350]  The one in the middle is going to get tortured?
[01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:11.350]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:13.350]  What strain do you have?
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.350]  Northern Lights.
[01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:17.350]  Old school Northern Lights number five?
[01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:19.350]  The cut that goes around Denver shops quite a bit.
[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.350]  Is that the one that Spence bred to?
[01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.350]  Yeah.
[01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:25.350]  Nice.
[01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:27.350]  That's a good cut.
[01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:29.350]  I had that for a little bit.
[01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:31.350]  That's the cut I made my grape OG with too.
[01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:33.350]  Oh, that's a great cut.
[01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:35.350]  It makes some donkey dicks for buds for sure.
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:37.350]  You can pull that fucker off and it's going to
[01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:39.350]  grow back because it's an outdoor plant and
[01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:41.350]  you're going to be amazed at how quickly the
[01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:43.350]  leaves grow back.
[01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:45.350]  You'll pull off a leaf the size of your hand
[01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:47.350]  and in 10 days you'll have one back bigger than
[01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.350]  your head.
[01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:51.350]  For sure.
[01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:53.350]  They just grow and grow.
[01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:55.350]  They love the outdoors.
[01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:57.350]  All right.
[01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:59.350]  We've talked about feeding a little bit.
[01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:01.350]  We talked a little bit about top dressing.
[01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.350]  We talked about defoliating.
[01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:05.350]  You mentioned specifically that we need to
[01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:07.350]  get rid of caterpillars.
[01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:09.350]  They've already got full grown caterpillars
[01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:11.350]  inside your fully developed buds.
[01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:13.350]  You're fucked.
[01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:15.350]  There's nothing you can do aside from just
[01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:17.350]  manually picking through and pulling them
[01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:19.350]  out yourself.
[01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:21.350]  Yuck.
[01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:23.350]  It sucks.
[01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:25.350]  Yuck.
[01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:27.350]  Now is the time to apply those preventative
[01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.350]  things that will keep them away.
[01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:31.350]  You're going to have to spray your bud
[01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:33.350]  sites.
[01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:35.350]  Spraying your buds is a good idea.
[01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.350]  Your...
[01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.350]  Oops, sorry.
[01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:41.350]  I just heard voices in my head jump.
[01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:43.350]  Or the volume in my head jumped.
[01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:45.350]  I was turning you up a little bit.
[01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:47.350]  You're getting far from the mic.
[01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:49.350]  I was trying to fix it, but you fixed yourself.
[01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:51.350]  You're good.
[01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:53.350]  You need some bud site for that BT to be on
[01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:55.350]  to ward off the parent from laying the egg
[01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:57.350]  in there in the first place.
[01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:59.350]  So BT is what I recommend.
[01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:02.350]  That's like Captain Jack's.
[01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:04.350]  It's a good idea.
[01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:05.350]  And then you can also use
[01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:07.350]  Monterey spray.
[01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:09.350]  Bacillus thuracid.
[01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:11.350]  Bacillus thuragensis.
[01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:13.350]  I think.
[01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:15.350]  I should Google that.
[01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:17.350]  You keep talking.
[01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:19.350]  I'll Google that one.
[01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:21.350]  That's what I recommend for getting rid of
[01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:23.350]  any kind of bud worm.
[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:25.350]  And now is the time to apply it.
[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:27.350]  Also, the garlic oil ferment that you
[01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:29.350]  were talking about is very good for that,
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:31.350]  too.
[01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:33.350]  Even just to see if you can get
[01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:35.350]  essential garlic oil from the health
[01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:37.350]  food store would probably have
[01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:39.350]  some of the same properties in it
[01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:41.350]  right there.
[01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:43.350]  Yes, it's Bacillus thuragensis.
[01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:45.350]  I was really close.
[01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:47.350]  So, yes, that's that's available
[01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:49.350]  from Captain Jack's.
[01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:51.350]  It's available in Monterey spray.
[01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.350]  It's a very, very popular product
[01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:55.350]  used for keeping away insects.
[01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:57.350]  And it's also usable.
[01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:59.350]  You can use it in the soil.
[01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:01.350]  It will not cause any problems.
[01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.350]  The mosquito dunks that you buy at
[01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:05.350]  Home Depot, that's the main
[01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:07.350]  ingredient in there.
[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:09.350]  You can crush those up.
[01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:11.350]  You can put that in some water.
[01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.350]  You can water that directly into
[01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:15.350]  your soil that will get rid of
[01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:17.350]  your fungus gnats.
[01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:19.350]  That'll get rid of most soil bound
[01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:21.350]  creatures.
[01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:23.350]  Actinovate is another brand name.
[01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:25.350]  That's a dry powdered product, but
[01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:27.350]  it's same active ingredient.
[01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:29.350]  Natural is the same thing.
[01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:31.350]  You guys, if you're going to use any
[01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:33.350]  of these powdered products beyond
[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.350]  the dry powder, I would recommend
[01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:37.350]  that you take that little booklet
[01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:39.350]  that's on there.
[01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:40.350]  I know it's crazy.
[01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:41.350]  Nobody does this.
[01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:42.350]  That little booklet, if you open
[01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:44.350]  it up, it tells you all the safety
[01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:45.350]  precautions.
[01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.350]  It's crazy.
[01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:47.350]  No one does.
[01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:48.350]  No, no one does.
[01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:49.350]  That's the truth.
[01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:50.350]  I love reading those.
[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.350]  It tells you how how much to apply
[01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:53.350]  on certain types of crops.
[01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:54.350]  It tells you how long between
[01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.350]  applications.
[01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:56.350]  It tells you what kind of safety
[01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:57.350]  equipment you need to wear.
[01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:59.350]  It's kind of whether you need to
[01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:00.350]  apply it in.
[01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:01.350]  Right.
[01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:02.350]  Because that matters.
[01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:03.350]  Because if it's going to rain and
[01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:04.350]  also in there, it tells you the
[01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:05.350]  reentry interval.
[01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:06.350]  How long from spring this product?
[01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.350]  Should you avoid this room without
[01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:10.350]  wearing protective gear?
[01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:11.350]  Because some of the chemicals and
[01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:12.350]  products that are available to
[01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:13.350]  HydroStore are much more toxic and
[01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.350]  dangerous than you realize.
[01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:16.350]  They expect you to be a responsible
[01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.350]  adult that can read that label.
[01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:19.350]  Shit that bear stuff, the bear
[01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:20.350]  spray they sell for your outdoor
[01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:22.350]  house at Lowe's that can kill you.
[01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:24.350]  Like that can completely kill a
[01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:25.350]  human if you fuck around and do it
[01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:27.350]  wrong. So pay attention to the
[01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:28.350]  labels. You guys read that shit.
[01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:29.350]  Read the safety sheets in there.
[01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:30.350]  It's really important.
[01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:31.350]  I know I sound like I'm preaching
[01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:32.350]  to you, but a lot of times when
[01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:34.350]  you're in a room with a bear, a
[01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:35.350]  bear spray, a lot of the things
[01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:36.350]  that you can get from these
[01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:37.350]  products, you won't notice until
[01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:38.350]  10 or 12 years down the line,
[01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:39.350]  you'll start getting a facial
[01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:40.350]  tick or something.
[01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:41.350]  And it'll be from that time you
[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:42.350]  sprayed for my into the fan and it
[01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:43.350]  came back into your face.
[01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:45.350]  That's how they affect you to its
[01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:46.350]  most.
[01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:48.350]  They nervous system and
[01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:49.350]  reproductive system.
[01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.350]  It's the exact same thing they do
[01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:51.350]  to the insects.
[01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:52.350]  Exactly.
[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:53.350]  To kill.
[01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:54.350]  Yeah.
[01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:55.350]  It's just going to take a little
[01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:56.350]  while longer on you because you're
[01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:57.350]  fucking 160 pounds.
[01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.350]  All right.
[01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:00.350]  So caterpillar prevention.
[01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:01.350]  Use that.
[01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:02.350]  It's a great spray.
[01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:03.350]  It's available in Captain Jack's
[01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:04.350]  Monterey insect spray.
[01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:05.350]  Has it.
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:06.350]  You guys a very good
[01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:07.350]  recommendation for you.
[01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:08.350]  They do not pay me.
[01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:09.350]  They don't sponsor me in any way.
[01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:10.350]  There's a company called
[01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:11.350]  Arbico dot com.
[01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:13.350]  A R B I C O dot com.
[01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:14.350]  They sell all types of
[01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:15.350]  horticultural supply, gardening
[01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:16.350]  supply type stuff.
[01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:18.350]  You can buy almost any type of
[01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:19.350]  sprays you want.
[01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:21.350]  You can buy organic sprays.
[01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:22.350]  You can buy crazy.
[01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:24.350]  They sell anything from stylet
[01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:25.350]  oil to fluoromite.
[01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:27.350]  And this one catalog.
[01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:29.350]  They also sell beneficial
[01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:30.350]  insects.
[01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:31.350]  That is something I was going to
[01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:32.350]  talk about on a future episode
[01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:33.350]  with you.
[01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.350]  But let's jump into it for a
[01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:35.350]  minute.
[01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:36.350]  Beneficial insects is now the
[01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:37.350]  time to release my whole
[01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:39.350]  bunch of beneficial insects.
[01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:41.350]  Yeah.
[01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:42.350]  Yeah.
[01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:43.350]  I mean, that'd be totally cool.
[01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:44.350]  Predator mites and ladybugs.
[01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:45.350]  For sure.
[01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:46.350]  Lace wigs.
[01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:47.350]  I go for Ladybug
[01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:49.350]  larvae, especially outdoors.
[01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:50.350]  OK.
[01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:52.350]  The larvae are a lot more
[01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:54.350]  productive, meaning they eat
[01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:55.350]  more shit.
[01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:56.350]  OK.
[01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.350]  They're still growing.
[01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:58.350]  Yeah.
[01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:59.350]  OK.
[01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:00.350]  They'll hang around longer, too.
[01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:01.350]  All right.
[01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:02.350]  What's the trick to keeping
[01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:03.350]  ladybugs to stick around?
[01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:04.350]  Is there a trick to that?
[01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:05.350]  I've heard some pretty awful
[01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:06.350]  things.
[01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:10.350]  For me, you know, outdoors is
[01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:12.350]  where I use them most and just
[01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:14.350]  having a nice welcoming
[01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:15.350]  environment.
[01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:16.350]  You know, it's.
[01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:19.350]  There's not normally many
[01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.350]  pests on the plants, but there
[01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.350]  can be pests found in the
[01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.350]  mulches and the garden beds
[01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:24.350]  around.
[01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:26.350]  So I think that works to keep
[01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:27.350]  them around.
[01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:28.350]  Stick around there, too.
[01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:29.350]  OK.
[01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.350]  How do you feel about a praying
[01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:31.350]  mantis?
[01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:32.350]  They're awesome.
[01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:33.350]  They're awesome.
[01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:34.350]  I'm sure.
[01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:36.350]  So Arbico.com happens to sell
[01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:37.350]  praying mantis larvae.
[01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:39.350]  You can order them, set the
[01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:40.350]  larvae on a plant.
[01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:41.350]  They will hatch and come alive
[01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:42.350]  in your garden.
[01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:43.350]  You can watch it happen.
[01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:44.350]  It's kind of cool.
[01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:45.350]  I haven't seen it happen, but
[01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:46.350]  I've seen videos of it because
[01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:47.350]  I'm kind of an Internet nerd.
[01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:48.350]  But yeah, check them out.
[01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:49.350]  That company does not pay me
[01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:50.350]  anything.
[01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:51.350]  But I mean, they've got all the
[01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:52.350]  products that you need if you
[01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:53.350]  want a preventative to keep the
[01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:54.350]  bugs away.
[01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:55.350]  If you want something a little
[01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.350]  stronger to destroy them or if
[01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.350]  you want to go full fucking
[01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:59.350]  madness nuclear, they've got the
[01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.350]  product for you.
[01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:01.350]  You can order it from there.
[01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:02.350]  They'll ship it to you quickly.
[01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.350]  Check them out.
[01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:04.350]  I use that product.
[01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:05.350]  I use that catalog all the time
[01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:06.350]  just for plenty of research to
[01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.350]  compare.
[01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:08.350]  Oh, I know.
[01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:09.350]  Yeah.
[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:10.350]  What is this versus this?
[01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:11.350]  Which is better?
[01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.350]  You just hold the page aside and
[01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:13.350]  see what you like better and
[01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:14.350]  read them.
[01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:15.350]  Yeah, they've got everything in
[01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:16.350]  there.
[01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:17.350]  But again, if you get some
[01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:18.350]  formite, if you get something
[01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:19.350]  crazy, get yourself a Tyvek suit
[01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:21.350]  and some gloves, a mask, suit
[01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:24.350]  up, go all Walter White style and
[01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:25.350]  that shit.
[01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:26.350]  Do it properly.
[01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:27.350]  Don't get sick.
[01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:28.350]  And I also think you're a
[01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:29.350]  bastard for spraying that shit
[01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:30.350]  outside.
[01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:31.350]  Yeah.
[01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:32.350]  Don't don't ever spray it
[01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:33.350]  outside.
[01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:34.350]  Yeah.
[01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:35.350]  Don't kill bees.
[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.350]  And that shit wipes out.
[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:38.350]  Just personal opinion without the
[01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:39.350]  bees, you don't have any food,
[01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:40.350]  right?
[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:41.350]  Especially me.
[01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:42.350]  I'm a vegetarian.
[01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:43.350]  Everything I eat grows.
[01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:44.350]  We don't have a lot of
[01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:46.350]  everything I eat either grows or
[01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:47.350]  eats.
[01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.350]  It's something that grows.
[01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:49.350]  Your food eats my food.
[01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:51.350]  It's not fair.
[01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:52.350]  It'd be a pretty shitty place
[01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:54.350]  without pollinators.
[01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:55.350]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:56.350]  So we want lady bugs.
[01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:58.350]  We want beneficial predators.
[01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:00.350]  Predatory mites is what I'm
[01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:01.350]  thinking.
[01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:02.350]  We want some of the praying
[01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:03.350]  mantises.
[01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:04.350]  What are the kind of bugs can we
[01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:05.350]  put out there to help us out?
[01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:07.350]  Worms in your soil.
[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:09.350]  OK.
[01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.350]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:11.350]  Put worms in the soil.
[01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:12.350]  Yeah.
[01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:13.350]  Is a spider good luck in your
[01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:14.350]  garden?
[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:15.350]  Is it a good thing to have one or
[01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:16.350]  two spiders?
[01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:17.350]  We've got a few.
[01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.350]  They'll eat most of the other
[01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:19.350]  bugs.
[01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:20.350]  Yeah.
[01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.350]  A wasp.
[01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:22.350]  We've got those two.
[01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:23.350]  OK.
[01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:24.350]  They're going to cause any
[01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:25.350]  problems, are they?
[01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:26.350]  No, not really.
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:28.350]  I've actually watched the wasps
[01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:31.350]  carry away a full grown
[01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:33.350]  worm before.
[01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:34.350]  Wow.
[01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:35.350]  OK, here in Colorado, we get
[01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:36.350]  something that I don't know if
[01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:37.350]  these happen anywhere else.
[01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:39.350]  And Michael, remember these?
[01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:41.350]  My microphone cover is bright
[01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:42.350]  orange.
[01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.350]  We get these orange bud worms.
[01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:44.350]  I've called them I've heard them
[01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:45.350]  called melon worms before.
[01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:47.350]  Yeah.
[01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:48.350]  Do you do you get those in your
[01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:49.350]  buds around here?
[01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:50.350]  I've never had those ones.
[01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:51.350]  I get like they're like a
[01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:52.350]  brownish green color.
[01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:53.350]  OK.
[01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:54.350]  But they're all I mean, they're
[01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:55.350]  all beetles of some kind, I
[01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:56.350]  believe.
[01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:57.350]  All right.
[01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:58.350]  It's the
[01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:00.350]  captain.
[01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:01.350]  I've seen the orange ones.
[01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:02.350]  Is the captain Jacks and the
[01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:03.350]  Monterey spray going to keep
[01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:04.350]  that shit away?
[01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:05.350]  It'll.
[01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:06.350]  Yeah.
[01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:07.350]  It affects them all equally.
[01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:08.350]  I mean, for the most part, if
[01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.350]  you got something really exotic
[01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:11.350]  and crazy, you know, I don't
[01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:13.350]  know.
[01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.350]  But I know here in southern
[01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.350]  Colorado, it takes care of
[01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.350]  anything.
[01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.350]  So.
[01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:19.350]  So if somebody is local, if
[01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:20.350]  they're here all the time, they
[01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:21.350]  know that the city is local.
[01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:22.350]  If they're here in the Pueblo,
[01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:23.350]  Colorado area, where can they go
[01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.350]  pick up some good
[01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:26.350]  sprays to take care of their
[01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:27.350]  insects?
[01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:28.350]  One love garden supply.
[01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:30.350]  That's it.
[01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:31.350]  Isn't that. Let me see if I can
[01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:32.350]  remember the address.
[01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:33.350]  It's one sixteen east fourth
[01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:34.350]  street.
[01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:35.350]  Right. Six, 18, six, 18.
[01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.350]  I had the right numbers as close
[01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:39.350]  as close as dyslexic or some shit
[01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:40.350]  on there. But yeah, six, 18
[01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.350]  east fourth street.
[01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:43.350]  Go support one love garden
[01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:44.350]  supply for sure.
[01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:45.350]  Burns down there.
[01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:46.350]  She's a great lady.
[01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:47.350]  She'll take good care of you.
[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:48.350]  Say hi to my beautiful wife.
[01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:49.350]  Yeah. Go say hi.
[01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.350]  Go support that place.
[01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:51.350]  Go support local businesses.
[01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:52.350]  If you can, guys, do that.
[01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:54.350]  Awesome. All right.
[01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:55.350]  We've been going for like 40
[01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:56.350]  minutes talking about outdoor
[01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:57.350]  growing. If you guys have any
[01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:58.350]  outdoor grow questions that you
[01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:59.350]  would like me to ask Jesse,
[01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:01.350]  send them to me.
[01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:02.350]  My email address is grow from
[01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:03.350]  your heart at Hotmail dot com.
[01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:04.350]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:06.350]  I will compile the questions.
[01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:07.350]  I'll take screenshots into my
[01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:08.350]  phone. I'll put them all in one
[01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:09.350]  little section and then I'll get
[01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:11.350]  Jesse back over here and we will
[01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:12.350]  address your questions
[01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:13.350]  specifically so that we can help
[01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:14.350]  you out with exactly what you
[01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.350]  need.
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:17.350]  Oh, yeah. Kind of dial it in and
[01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:18.350]  aim it a little more at you
[01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:19.350]  specifically and get what you
[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:20.350]  need.
[01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:21.350]  One other quick thing.
[01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:22.350]  Plants are going to start using
[01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:23.350]  more water.
[01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.350]  So
[01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:26.350]  don't just give them what they'll
[01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:28.350]  take and what they need to stay
[01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:29.350]  perked up.
[01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:30.350]  If you want big fat bugs, you
[01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:32.350]  got to get them lots of water.
[01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:33.350]  Lots of water.
[01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:34.350]  I guess that that mainly applies
[01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:35.350]  to in-ground plants.
[01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:37.350]  But same,
[01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:39.350]  same, you know, same for
[01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:40.350]  potted container.
[01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:42.350]  I mean, it'll only take so much
[01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:43.350]  water.
[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:44.350]  But right.
[01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:45.350]  But as soon as it dries, give it
[01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:46.350]  some more. Oh, yeah.
[01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:47.350]  Don't be shy.
[01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:48.350]  Don't sleep in and think you can
[01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:49.350]  water those plants later.
[01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:50.350]  No, you can't.
[01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:51.350]  You got to get out there and water
[01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:52.350]  right now.
[01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:53.350]  If you're not want to stay on it,
[01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:54.350]  don't start it.
[01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:55.350]  That's the truth.
[01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:56.350]  If you let them dry out,
[01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:58.350]  it's a noticeable chunk out of
[01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:59.350]  your harvest.
[01:35:59.350 --> 01:36:01.350]  Yeah, it's I'm sure it's a
[01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:02.350]  noticeable percentage.
[01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:04.350]  So it's like that in indoor or
[01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.350]  outdoor.
[01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:06.350]  Yeah. How do you feel about using
[01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:07.350]  a drip system in an outdoor girl?
[01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:09.350]  Awesome. Awesome.
[01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:11.350]  OK, I've promised the listeners
[01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:12.350]  that I would talk about building a
[01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:13.350]  drip system, but it's
[01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:15.350]  not a lot of plant involvement and
[01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:16.350]  I don't want to spend too much of
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.350]  an episode talking about building
[01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:19.350]  PVC pipes.
[01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:20.350]  That actually kind of be a hard
[01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:21.350]  episode because it's not really
[01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.350]  hard.
[01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:23.350]  Right.
[01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:24.350]  Just some that just go do it.
[01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:26.350]  Just get your hands dirty.
[01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:27.350]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:28.350]  I'll just. There you go.
[01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:29.350]  That's perfect. I'll give him like a
[01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:30.350]  five or 10 minute primer.
[01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.350]  Yeah. Here's what you need.
[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.350]  You need a pump and some tubes and
[01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:33.350]  a fucking octopus head and some
[01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:34.350]  tubing and some sprinklers and you
[01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:35.350]  build that.
[01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:36.350]  It seems really daunting.
[01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:38.350]  But tutorial.
[01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:40.350]  Yeah. Just get like Jesse said,
[01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:41.350]  just doing it because you got to
[01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:42.350]  get out there and measure.
[01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:44.350]  You need a tape measure and PVC
[01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:45.350]  pipe cutter and just got to go to
[01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:46.350]  town and learn how to build.
[01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:47.350]  It's like Legos.
[01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.350]  Basically, I bought these two
[01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:50.350]  thirty dollar kits from Lowe's
[01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:52.350]  and like I'd never.
[01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:53.350]  This was last year.
[01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:55.350]  I'd never really done a drip system
[01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:56.350]  before. I was a little nervous.
[01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:58.350]  And by the afternoon, I'm like, I'm
[01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:59.350]  a fucking expert.
[01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:00.350]  Yeah.
[01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:03.350]  It's it's really not.
[01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:05.350]  It's boys playing with Legos is
[01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:06.350]  essentially what it is.
[01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:07.350]  They have all of the parts over
[01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:08.350]  there at Lowe's.
[01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:09.350]  If you go to that little section
[01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:10.350]  and look around, your head will
[01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:11.350]  just start spinning and you'll know
[01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:12.350]  what to do. I'll do a quick lesson
[01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:13.350]  on it in the future here.
[01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:14.350]  I might let you guys know what I
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:15.350]  do in the future here.
[01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.350]  I might let you come hang out with
[01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:17.350]  me and talk to you.
[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:18.350]  And also it'll be fun.
[01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.350]  All right, guys, we've got 40
[01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:20.350]  minutes. Is there anything funny
[01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:21.350]  you want to ramble and talk about
[01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:22.350]  chaotically, randomly that you want
[01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:23.350]  to make sure that people hear on a
[01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:24.350]  podcast, anything you got coming up
[01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:25.350]  that you want to share with people?
[01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:28.350]  I just put you guys on the spot and
[01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:29.350]  you both look at me blankly.
[01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:30.350]  The secret session is coming up,
[01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:31.350]  you guys.
[01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:32.350]  August 27th.
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:33.350]  I cannot reveal the location, but
[01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:35.350]  it is coming up. I should be there.
[01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:36.350]  It's a secret.
[01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.350]  It's a secret.
[01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:39.350]  It's the same day as Reggae on the
[01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:40.350]  Rocks. So I've got to go to Reggae
[01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:41.350]  on the Rocks.
[01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:42.350]  But the headline I'm not into the
[01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:43.350]  headlining band.
[01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:44.350]  I'm just not feeling it.
[01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:46.350]  So I'm going to leave during the
[01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:47.350]  headlining band and then I'm going to
[01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:48.350]  go over to secret session.
[01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:50.350]  Mike, I wish I could tag you in for
[01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:51.350]  the headlining band, bro.
[01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:53.350]  Oh, is it my boy?
[01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:54.350]  It's your boys.
[01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:55.350]  It's your boys.
[01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.350]  Yeah, sorry. No offense.
[01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:57.350]  It's just not my thing.
[01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:59.350]  But now, wait, now that they're able
[01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:01.350]  to play Reggae on the Rocks, like I'm
[01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:02.350]  less of a fan than I used to be.
[01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:04.350]  Mike's favorite band.
[01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:05.350]  Those guys.
[01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:06.350]  Three. Three. Eleven is Mike's
[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:07.350]  favorite band.
[01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:08.350]  Reggae on the Rocks.
[01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:09.350]  Yeah, they're playing with Iration.
[01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.350]  It's three eleven and Iration.
[01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:11.350]  Doing a set together.
[01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:13.350]  Oh, man, at Red Rocks.
[01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:14.350]  Red Rocks is such a beautiful venue
[01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:15.350]  for the band.
[01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:16.350]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:17.350]  It's like the first time a plebeian
[01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:19.350]  snuck into the Roman council or some
[01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:20.350]  shit like that.
[01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:23.350]  They've been Reggae on the Rocks has
[01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:25.350]  been not as Reggae every year.
[01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:27.350]  That's the politest way to say that.
[01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:28.350]  But they've.
[01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:29.350]  While the band has got slightly more
[01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:30.350]  Reggae.
[01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:32.350]  Two of my two of my favorite Reggae
[01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:34.350]  bands ever are opening the show.
[01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:36.350]  Steel Pulse, of course, if you're a
[01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:37.350]  Reggae fan, you know, good old Steel
[01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:38.350]  Pulse. If you've ever hung out with me,
[01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:39.350]  you know, I'm a big fan of Steel Pulse.
[01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:40.350]  If you've ever hung out with me, you
[01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:42.350]  know, I love Steel Pulse and Morgan
[01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:43.350]  Heritage is also there.
[01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:45.350]  And those are my two favorite.
[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:46.350]  Like if I had to just pick two Reggae
[01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:48.350]  bands that like defined what I like
[01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:49.350]  about Reggae, those would be the bands.
[01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:51.350]  So that's that's a great show for me.
[01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:52.350]  It'll be the afternoon.
[01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:53.350]  I'll get all sunburned.
[01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:54.350]  I'll have a good time.
[01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:55.350]  Nice. And then when it starts getting
[01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:56.350]  all three eleven.
[01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:58.350]  That one I'm going to take off.
[01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:01.350]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:02.350]  Three eleven is going to come on.
[01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:03.350]  Your hair is so cool.
[01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:06.350]  I met three eleven backstage
[01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:08.350]  at Warped Tour one time.
[01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:09.350]  I want tickets and a meet and greet
[01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:10.350]  from Kilo.
[01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:11.350]  That's fucking rad.
[01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:12.350]  Yeah, that's cool.
[01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:14.350]  The dopest thing was this dope ass
[01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:16.350]  Jansport backpack I got in the giveaway
[01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.350]  too.
[01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:18.350]  Because I'm not a three eleven fan
[01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:20.350]  either.
[01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:22.350]  Actually, there's a three eleven
[01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:24.350]  used to actually get in fist fights
[01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:26.350]  with Sublime, which is my favorite band.
[01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.350]  And I know a lot of people, they sound
[01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:29.350]  like the exact same band.
[01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:31.350]  But so
[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:32.350]  I don't like three eleven.
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:35.350]  And the whole time I was bringing up
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:36.350]  all these fights and these guys are
[01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:39.350]  like, man, these guys are lame and just
[01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:40.350]  kind of wandered off.
[01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.350]  I was like 19 years old.
[01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:44.350]  So nice.
[01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:45.350]  You weren't as polite as you are now,
[01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:46.350]  either.
[01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:47.350]  No, no.
[01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:48.350]  I'm sure you were. You're having a
[01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:49.350]  little more fun with them than you're
[01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:50.350]  letting on.
[01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:51.350]  You might have trolled them a little
[01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:53.350]  bit before trolling people was a thing.
[01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:54.350]  Totally.
[01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:57.350]  All right. Let's remind everybody how

[01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:15.350]  Thank you.
[01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:16.350]  A lot of fun. I love these outdoor
[01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:17.350]  girl episodes.
[01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:19.350]  I've got notebooks full of notes from
[01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:21.350]  other shows from these
[01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:22.350]  lessons episodes.

[01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:28.350]  I hope you had a great time.
[01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:30.350]  I'm going to wrap up this part of the
[01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:31.350]  show.
[01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:32.350]  If if you're listening,
[01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:34.350]  this would be a good time for
[01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:36.350]  emails about tips and
[01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.350]  tricks for harvest.
[01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:38.350]  Oh, there you go.
[01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:39.350]  If you get any questions, we have
[01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:41.350]  time to answer for you to prep
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:42.350]  for that.
[01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:44.350]  Outdoor harvest can be overwhelming.
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:45.350]  Yep.
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:46.350]  Yep.
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:47.350]  Somebody that from their Facebook
[01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:49.350]  post looks like they're a wee bit
[01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:50.350]  overwhelmed.
[01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:52.350]  Oh, I know two people that still
[01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:53.350]  haven't trimmed all their shit from
[01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:54.350]  last year.
[01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:55.350]  And I'm not even kidding.
[01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:57.350]  And they put themselves in an even
[01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:58.350]  worse predicament this year.
[01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:00.350]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:01.350]  It sounds like, you know, them very
[01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:02.350]  well.
[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:03.350]  Uh huh.
[01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.350]  All right. Don't be shy, you guys.
[01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:07.350]  I would love to answer your
[01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:08.350]  questions on the show.
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:09.350]  Jesse would love to come back and

[01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:14.350]  the podcast and take some dabs and
[01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:15.350]  hang out.

[01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:18.350]  I love bringing material.
[01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:19.350]  So bring it.

[01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:27.350]  friends with me.
[01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.350]  You know, I'm going to play some

[01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:30.350]  minutes and I'll be right back and

[01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:31.370]  and get out of here.
[01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:32.370]  Take a fat dab and give your
[01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.370]  mom a hug for me.
[01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:34.370]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[01:44:34.370 --> 01:48:22.180]  It's your boy Rasta Jeff.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:23.180]  Before I start episode 150, I
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:24.180]  wanted to drop in and say thank
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.180]  you to everyone that listens to
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:26.180]  the podcast and everyone who has
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.180]  ever been on the podcast.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.180]  150 episodes means a lot to me
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:29.180]  and I appreciate all of the
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:30.180]  support.
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:31.180]  Also, this podcast was recorded
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.180]  live at the Canna Canyon.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.180]  From about six minutes until ten
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.180]  minutes, it gets a little noisy.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:35.180]  I tried to fix it the best I
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.180]  could, but it sounds a little
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:37.180]  crappy and I do apologize.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.180]  After ten minutes, it'll be
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.180]  crystal clear and you'll see
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.180]  the final version of the podcast
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.180]  live on the Canna Canyon.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.180]  I'm Rasta Jeff.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.180]  I'm a podcaster.
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:44.180]  I'm a podcaster.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:32.300]  Once again, thanks for the
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:33.300]  support.
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:34.300]  Now here's episode 150 of the
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:35.300]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:36.300]  To the Cannabis community, it's
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.300]  time for episode number 150 of

[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:40.300]  education, and conversations.
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.300]  That's right, if you're a new
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.300]  grower, if you're a professional
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.300]  grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.400]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.400]  a Cannabis activist or even
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.400]  someone who's just curious about
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  the current state of Cannabis,

[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.280]  They let me invade their space for two or three hours.

[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.880]  They will get you set up with everything you need.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna let the music play
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.400]  for just a couple of seconds, and when we get back,
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.720]  we'll be at the Canna Canyon,
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.520]  and we will be joined by the Dabbing Granny,
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.680]  THC Sam, Brett from Evo Labs,
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.240]  Lindsey the Traveling Stoner, and Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.080]  Hang out with me.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:54.920]  Wait, what?
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.080]  Wait, Lindsey, did you just say that you're too stoned?
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.400]  Is that what you just said?
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.720]  I'm gonna hand you this microphone
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.360]  so that we can hear what you're saying.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.200]  Yeah.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.280]  I mean, I might have.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.120]  That's right, yeah.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.120]  There are six people here, and there are four microphones.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.320]  Everybody, welcome to the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.640]  the 150th episode.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.960]  I don't know if anybody at the stable knew
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.560]  that we were number 150.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:18.400]  Check that out.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.880]  Yeah, 150 here at the Canna Canyon.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.200]  I'm fucking stoked.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.080]  I am happy.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:22.920]  That's Brett who is fucking stoked,
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.480]  and that is Dabbing Granny who's happy.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.000]  Let me slowly introduce everybody here.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, to my left,
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.160]  back again to try to get this right this damn time.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.640]  I apologize for screwing it up the first time,
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.920]  but joining me is a beautiful Dabbing Granny
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.760]  is to my left.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:34.720]  Welcome back to the show, honey.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.520]  Oh, Jeff, I'm so excited to be here.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:37.520]  Thanks for having me.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.600]  It's so good to be here with you again.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.440]  Thanks for coming back.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.320]  Thanks for being patient with me.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.360]  No worries.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:44.440]  You know, it was terrible that my SD card failed,
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.680]  but I'm excited that everyone's back again.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.600]  It's kind of exciting.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.080]  So sitting to the left of Dabbing Granny is my new friend.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.120]  They call him THC Sam.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.800]  He is Sam from THC Magazine.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.640]  Dude, thanks for joining me.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.520]  Thank you very much for having me on InstaVN Included.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.530]  Awesome, man.
[01:51:58.530 --> 01:51:59.530]  Next, let's get the mic a little closer
[01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:00.610]  because I'm not sure we got you too much,
[01:52:00.610 --> 01:52:01.930]  but I'll make sure that we pump you up.
[01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:02.770]  You're good, bro.
[01:52:02.770 --> 01:52:03.610]  You're good.
[01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:04.450]  Welcome to the podcast.
[01:52:04.450 --> 01:52:05.290]  I'll guide you.
[01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:06.130]  Don't worry.
[01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:06.970]  And now the guy that's excited,
[01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:07.810]  you're bouncing in your chair, bro.
[01:52:07.810 --> 01:52:10.330]  Mr. Instagram over there, Mr. Fish Eye on the phone.
[01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:12.010]  I'm Terp Pimp.
[01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:12.850]  Terp Pimp.
[01:52:12.850 --> 01:52:13.690]  Since everyone here is a Terp,
[01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:15.650]  or he is a Terp slut, he's our Terp Pimp.
[01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:16.490]  I'm not a slut.
[01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:17.330]  I'm not a slut.
[01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:18.210]  I'm not a slut.
[01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:19.050]  I'm not a slut.
[01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:19.970]  I'm the white Terp Pimp.
[01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:21.650]  You are the Terp Pimp.
[01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:22.490]  But it's all good.
[01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:24.250]  That name was given to me.
[01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:26.770]  I did not declare that myself.
[01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:27.610]  You're not a proclaimed Terp Pimp?
[01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:29.170]  No, no, I did not proclaim that myself.
[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:33.130]  It's Rooster Brett, the Terp Pimp.
[01:52:33.130 --> 01:52:35.010]  Anything Granny says to me, I'll take.
[01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:35.850]  It's official.
[01:52:35.850 --> 01:52:37.450]  It's official shit once Granny says it.
[01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:38.290]  Welcome to the show, brother.
[01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:41.730]  Brent is, of course, the lab manager at Evo Labs.
[01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:42.970]  He is partially responsible
[01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:46.890]  for all these beautiful cannabis-extracted terpines
[01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:48.890]  that we've been enjoying and we truly appreciate it.
[01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:51.010]  We're gonna talk about terpine extraction.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:53.530]  We're gonna try to pry into his business a little bit
[01:52:53.530 --> 01:52:54.690]  here in the future.
[01:52:54.690 --> 01:52:58.090]  But across the table is one of my heroes,
[01:52:58.090 --> 01:53:00.290]  the guy that makes the fucking tables
[01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:01.850]  with emails built into them.
[01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:02.690]  Holy shit.
[01:53:02.690 --> 01:53:03.530]  What up, guys?
[01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:04.610]  That's my buddy, Bobo Blastrico.
[01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:05.490]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:53:05.490 --> 01:53:06.730]  Thank you for having me here.
[01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:08.210]  Good, thanks for coming up to the Canna Canyon
[01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.050]  and hanging out.
[01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.890]  I'm so happy to be here.
[01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:12.970]  I was a little jelly I wasn't here for the first one.
[01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:13.810]  You were in Florida, bro.
[01:53:13.810 --> 01:53:14.970]  You have to be jelly about it.
[01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:15.810]  You were on the beach with a dog.
[01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:17.610]  I was still jealous about it.
[01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:19.170]  When I heard, we were at Canna Canyon,
[01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:20.210]  I was like, oh, the terps.
[01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:21.050]  I was like, oh, man.
[01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:22.170]  I was like, a huge sesh?
[01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:23.010]  That's awesome.
[01:53:23.010 --> 01:53:25.890]  Yeah, on these cozy couches with dad and granny hanging out.
[01:53:25.890 --> 01:53:26.730]  Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:28.370]  And orange soda.
[01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:31.010]  And this orange soda hash that granny brought.
[01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:32.050]  Last time it was so wonderful,
[01:53:32.050 --> 01:53:33.770]  she went and got more for us.
[01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:36.890]  She says that if this hash keeps becoming available
[01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:39.410]  from Incredibles, she's gonna go broke.
[01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:44.410]  No, I will be down on Nevada in my high heels
[01:53:44.690 --> 01:53:49.210]  and my red lips and my painted fingernails.
[01:53:49.210 --> 01:53:52.090]  Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
[01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:55.770]  all donations to dad and granny on that corner post.
[01:53:55.770 --> 01:54:00.770]  And now, please, please do not go through the terp pimp.
[01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:07.410]  You must go, is my official manager for Nevada.
[01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:09.370]  So let's introduce to the podcast,
[01:54:09.370 --> 01:54:11.170]  the official, the traveling stoner,
[01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:13.130]  dad and granny's terp pimp.
[01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:15.010]  This podcast started off wonderfully.
[01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.890]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:17.210]  She's a terp pimp.
[01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.250]  Granny's already on the corner of the scenario.
[01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:21.090]  Can we work together or something?
[01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:23.770]  You can get her and I can get your guy or something.
[01:54:23.770 --> 01:54:24.770]  Yeah, I got you.
[01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:25.610]  Awesome.
[01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:26.450]  I got you, you can have him.
[01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:28.850]  Did this show just become Tinder?
[01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:29.770]  What just happened over here?
[01:54:29.770 --> 01:54:33.490]  Bender, Tinder, Grindr, whatever those things are.
[01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:35.090]  All right, all right, welcome to the show, everybody.
[01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:35.930]  Thank you guys for joining me.
[01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:38.530]  Podcast listeners, I'm gonna put this show
[01:54:38.530 --> 01:54:39.570]  back on track a little bit.
[01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:41.730]  We're here live at the Cana Canyon, the Cana Canyon,
[01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:44.010]  Colorado Springs' premier social lounge
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.130]  where you can come and if you're 21 and over,
[01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:47.970]  you do not need a medical marijuana card.
[01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:50.730]  If you're 21, you have an ID and you're not a dick,
[01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:51.850]  you can come here, you can hang out,
[01:54:51.850 --> 01:54:53.730]  you can sign a member agreement.
[01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:55.050]  There may be products available
[01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:56.650]  that if they share it with you,
[01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:58.290]  you may reimburse them for the products
[01:54:58.290 --> 01:54:59.410]  that are available here.
[01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.410]  Oftentimes there are some tasty hashes,
[01:55:01.410 --> 01:55:02.930]  there are tasty flowers here.
[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:03.850]  Come check it out.
[01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:05.730]  Make sure you tip your bud tenders.
[01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:07.890]  Be kind to everybody and clean up after yourself.
[01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:08.730]  You come join us.
[01:55:08.730 --> 01:55:10.730]  You might come take some dabs with Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:13.850]  With dad and granny, you never know who could be here.
[01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:16.650]  The traveling stoner is here quite frequently.
[01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:18.170]  You might get to meet Bitty the dog.
[01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:19.770]  You may meet Sirius.
[01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:20.610]  Come check it out.
[01:55:20.610 --> 01:55:21.450]  This place is cool as shit.
[01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:22.270]  It's classy as fuck.
[01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:23.610]  The couches are comfy.
[01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:25.370]  The air conditioning is kicking and it's the summertime,
[01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:27.090]  so this is the place to be.
[01:55:27.090 --> 01:55:28.490]  Dad and granny, I see you here a lot
[01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:30.490]  now that I've bumped into you and met you.
[01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:32.370]  This is my favorite dab lounge.
[01:55:32.370 --> 01:55:33.210]  This is your favorite?
[01:55:33.210 --> 01:55:36.250]  This is like sitting in somebody's living room.
[01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:37.690]  I love it that there are no TVs here.
[01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:39.890]  All the other social lounges have TVs
[01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:41.970]  and everyone just zones out into a TV.
[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:47.600]  Or there's pool tables or like mine,
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.240]  sitting down, dabbing, talking,
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.840]  exchanging knowledge and giggles.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.960]  Lots of giggles today.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:54.800]  Oh my goodness.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:57.440]  Exchanging terps, exchanging grow knowledge.
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.200]  I made a new friend.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.760]  My friend Sam over here has also experienced a head injury
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.040]  and he's writing a book about it.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.160]  Can we talk about your book?
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.280]  Get a little closer, a little closer.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:08.100]  You're good.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:08.940]  We'll get you introduced.
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:09.780]  When do you play?
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:10.720]  Sorry, you heated up a nail
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.680]  and then I started talking to you.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.040]  You're gonna miss that dab opportunity.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.360]  I apologize.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.280]  When do you expect your book to come out?
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.120]  I don't know, I'm not sure.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:17.960]  Over the next few years.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.280]  Over the next few years, okay.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.520]  When you have that book prepared,
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.240]  I'd love to read it and have you on the show
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.240]  and talk about it because it's great talking
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.720]  to other people that have experienced
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.440]  traumatic brain injuries.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:29.600]  Well, thankfully, I grew up in a,
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.400]  my parents were pretty big fans of holistic medicine.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.560]  So I didn't really, they weren't too big of a fan
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:38.080]  to put me right on any kind of pharmaceuticals, thankfully.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:38.920]  Good, good.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.200]  So your parents were looking out for you then?
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.200]  Yeah, so thankfully that was a pretty great decision
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.040]  on their part and actually to speak something else,
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.600]  to speak on something else besides head injuries
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.520]  when I was in college, I blew out some ligaments in my knee.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.000]  So cannabis is much more of an effective pain reliever
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.720]  than a lot of the opioids that you get prescribed
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:55.080]  so quickly and in such large doses.
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.760]  So cannabis is really just something
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.720]  that a lot of people should really be more aware of
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:01.280]  and if even not aware of, just more accepting of.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.560]  Right, and no addiction.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.400]  Right.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.480]  And you don't go down that black spiral with cannabis.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.960]  Cannabis is good for you, excellent.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.160]  Dude, thanks for joining me on the podcast.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.000]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  Yeah, I'd love to read your book when it's available.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.120]  If you need any insight or you want to talk about it,
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.240]  I'd love to hear more about that.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:16.600]  Thank you so much and also if everybody
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.040]  could check out The Hemp Connoisseur.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.240]  That's where I was headed next, perfect segue.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.080]  Oh, cool.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.600]  Yeah, this man's on top of it with me.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.760]  Yeah, tell me more about your magazine.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:24.600]  I'd love to hear more about it.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.360]  Yeah, I'm a writer and photographer with THC Magazine,
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.120]  The Hemp Connoisseur, based out of Denver,
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:30.400]  but we actually recently just went national.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.800]  We have copies of the new national,
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.560]  the new summer edition in Barnes and Nobles
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:34.800]  across the country.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.560]  So we hope everybody can be on the lookout for that.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:39.720]  Lots of content.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720]  Yeah, tons of content.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.960]  Great pictures, really great, well done magazine.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.800]  Thank you, we appreciate it.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.040]  We appreciate the copy you gave me.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.320]  Dale, post an Instagram shot of this magazine.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.160]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.440]  Yeah, and if everybody wants to follow
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.760]  The Hemp Connoisseur on Instagram as well,
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.600]  we'd appreciate that.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.080]  We're trying to get everybody kind of more aware of hemp
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.160]  and everything that it can do,
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:55.480]  as well as everything that cannabis does.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:56.920]  We're kind of trying to really spread the message.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.200]  Sorry, it's our sister plant.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.120]  And it's classified as the same thing, unfortunately,
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.920]  even though it's a textile and not a...
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:05.800]  Brett, what are you so excited about over there?
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.200]  Yeah, he also wrote this dope-ass article
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.920]  from Dreamlives, and I see some really nice pieces
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.760]  that I'd love to read sometime.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.400]  Yeah, this has a real nice wide array
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.880]  of everything in the cannabis community.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.160]  It's got a little bit of glass,
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.680]  it's got a little bit of edible knowledge,
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.960]  a little grow knowledge.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:28.680]  It's got a lot.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:29.520]  Excellent magazine.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.840]  Thanks for joining us, Sam.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.440]  Thank you guys very much, we appreciate it.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.360]  Brett, let's talk about Terps, buddy.
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.560]  Ah, Terps.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.400]  I'm kind of building it up
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.520]  so we can save Granny a little bit.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.360]  We're hyping it up.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.480]  I like Terps, though.
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:43.680]  I'll turn Granny on for you, it's all good.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:47.720]  I think Granny loves Terps more than life itself.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.560]  I do.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:49.400]  She loves Terps.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.520]  Don't look how cocky you are.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.360]  Like, I feel like that's my favorite part about you, Brett.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.600]  I just love Brett.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:55.440]  I know.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.280]  How can you not love Brett?
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:57.120]  He's so good. Honestly.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.640]  Yeah, he's just a walking smile with Terps in his pocket.
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.720]  What could go wrong?
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:01.560]  Honestly.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.400]  I like it.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.040]  He's a walking smile with Terps in his pocket.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.040]  That's probably the best compliment I've ever gotten.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.320]  I like that.
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:10.160]  I like that.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.000]  Tell us more about,
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.480]  so we recorded this podcast before,
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:16.960]  and I asked, explain to me what a Terp is,
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.760]  nice and easily, so that everybody,
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.920]  keep in mind that more than 50% of my listeners
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.400]  are from a place where cannabis is illegal,
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:28.320]  so they know very basic knowledge about cannabis.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.880]  So let's break it down to where
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:31.960]  they're able to follow along with us.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:33.880]  Definitely, definitely.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.920]  Well, terpenes are in basically every type of,
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.240]  well, there's two different types of things
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.520]  that could be in fruits or vegetables and stuff like that.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:49.680]  Terpenes are esters, but a lot of stuff
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:54.520]  that you get either a smell from or a taste from
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:58.280]  comes from some type of terpene combination.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:02.520]  And terpenes are in apples, oranges, bananas,
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:04.440]  everything, they also are in cannabis.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.680]  Now, from my understanding, as of right now,
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.880]  there hasn't been any esters found in cannabis,
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:14.080]  but there are tons of terpenes.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.720]  And there are over 115 terpenes,
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  150 terpenes that make up kind of a plant profile.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.960]  Yeah, right now, the best labs can maybe test for 30 of them.
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:31.000]  Okay.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:33.360]  Maybe 30 for maybe the best labs.
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:37.200]  And I honestly don't even know how accurate those 30 tests,
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:39.160]  those 30 terpenes to testing is actually
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:40.480]  how accurate they are.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.760]  But, and then after that, there's some companies
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.120]  that can go for 15 or even 10.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.120]  So, I mean, it's, that's basically,
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.680]  there's a whole bunch of different terpenes
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:57.280]  that make up a plant profile.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:00.200]  So the terps are basically what give a cannabis plant
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.240]  its smell.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:04.400]  Its smell, its taste, but also there's a lot more
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:06.160]  than just smell and taste to it.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:09.160]  And this guy, Sam, next to me knows a lot
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.520]  about the health benefits
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.640]  and actually knows a lot about terpenes.
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:16.640]  And that's what actually the big article
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.320]  in the magazine is about.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.760]  And he knows a lot about the health benefits.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.840]  There is a lot of stuff to do with the floral,
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:27.400]  the smell of it, the taste of it.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.080]  And that's what most people that buy it
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.880]  only understand, but I have learned a lot
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.720]  from Sam about it.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.080]  I like the way Sam set up.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.480]  He knows his shit when it comes to this.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.960]  I wouldn't say I'm like a total expert,
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.920]  but I've definitely had a chance to learn
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:47.080]  a little bit about terpenes on a little bit
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:48.960]  of a different level, which is cool.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.920]  That's one of the articles in the summer edition
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:51.880]  of the Hemp Connoisseur.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:53.440]  Excellent.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:54.280]  And terpenes.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.600]  Let them know you also worked as an expert.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.600]  You worked in, okay.
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.040]  We'll just keep going.
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:06.480]  So basically, as popular as terpenes are for flavor,
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.760]  they do a lot more medically.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.560]  I actually had a chance to talk with Max Montrose.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.040]  He's the head of the Tricome Institute.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.040]  And he is probably the terpene head, the terpene expert.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.360]  So he gave me a really nice little education.
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:23.320]  And terpenes are basically, the way he described it
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.520]  and the way that I kind of explained it in the article
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.280]  is basically like a glass of beer.
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.080]  So when you have a fresh cannabis plant,
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.200]  that's a fresh glass of beer with all of those bubbles
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.360]  floating off, all that carbonation floating up to the top.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.240]  Over time, that disappears.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.760]  Over time with a fresh cannabis plant,
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:38.480]  those fresh oils, those fresh terpenes
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.840]  on the end of the plant are gonna disappear over time.
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:42.760]  And those not only add flavor,
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.960]  but they also add, depending on the terpene,
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.000]  a lot of medical benefits.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.180]  Some of them are anti-psychotic, they're anti-seizure,
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:49.720]  they're anti-inflammatory.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:51.200]  They do a whole lot of different things
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.800]  that we're just really starting to learn about.
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.160]  Also depending on what time of harvest you do
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.040]  with the plant, you can also pull different terpenes
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:00.840]  with it too.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.920]  I know that, Jeff, I don't know if you,
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:03.280]  I mean you grow a lot more than I do,
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.720]  but I know that if you chop plants,
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:08.360]  certain plants earlier, certain plants late,
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.800]  you can get a higher CBG or CBN rate usually.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.960]  And that can actually help with what,
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:18.400]  in the end, what terpenes you pull off that plant.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.400]  That makes a lot of sense.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.720]  Also the heat, how much heat that plant is affected
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.360]  or touched by, how much light is put onto it.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.040]  Yeah, there are definitely ways that the plant
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:27.960]  can be affected to increase and decrease
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.200]  specific terpenes.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.680]  And really what fascinated me most,
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.480]  I think, about my conversation with Max Montrose
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.200]  is really that what people think is the medical benefit
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.440]  coming from cannabinoids might really be coming
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.360]  from terpenes.
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.960]  So it's really kind of, you have to really combine the two
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.920]  to really get a full picture of really what's happening.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.920]  Because every strain has CBD, CBN, CBG,
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.240]  depending on the strain to some ratio.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.820]  But what really differs, what really differentiates,
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.280]  excuse me, a lot of strains is that terpene profile.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.240]  Because not every strain is going to have
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:57.840]  that certain combination of terpenes.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.760]  So the combination of that terpene profile
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.560]  and the cannabinoids in that specific strain
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.800]  kind of contribute to the overall effect
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.000]  and the overall medical benefit that people get.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:07.840]  I like it.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:10.400]  I've noticed when I take a small dab
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.600]  and I dunk it into a little bit of terps,
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:14.840]  I get way higher than I would get from a dab
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:17.240]  a little bit bigger than that dab size,
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.080]  if that makes any sense.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.260]  Yeah, so there's still studies going on.
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:22.040]  I definitely understand what Sam's talking about
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.920]  and I have read about it and I do have talked to Max.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:28.400]  I do know that there are still more studies,
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.720]  hopefully that there's gonna be even bigger studies
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.520]  going on, obviously, with the advancement of cannabis
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.480]  in this community, hopefully more studies.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.000]  But what Sam was saying is really true,
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.360]  how without terpenes, cannabinoids might not
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.920]  transfer in your brain or transfer in your body the same way.
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.120]  So that's what kind of might, there's still studies.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.120]  I'm not, don't quote me, obviously,
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.800]  but I know that there's people talking about
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:02.680]  without the terpenes, you can't get the same effect
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.040]  and it's kind of true, because I've felt it.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.660]  I mean, you don't get the full.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:10.760]  I've said before that it wouldn't.
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.760]  Wouldn't a good example be taking the distillate
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:18.760]  or which is pretty much all the terps are pulled out.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:24.600]  So when you smoke that by itself,
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.320]  which you're not supposed to do,
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:30.840]  we're not advocating that at all.
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.040]  It's distilled by itself, right?
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:32.880]  Yeah.
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.120]  Yeah, but I mean, you should put some terps in it.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:34.960]  It could taste good.
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.360]  It tastes way better with terps.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.970]  It tastes terrible without the whole,
[02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:41.610]  depending on what, what?
[02:05:41.610 --> 02:05:42.450]  You think it's good?
[02:05:42.450 --> 02:05:43.290]  It's still great by itself,
[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:45.930]  but you want 100% amazing with the terps.
[02:05:45.930 --> 02:05:47.930]  It's like sugar on your cereal.
[02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:50.610]  Yes, it just puts it on a whole new level.
[02:05:50.610 --> 02:05:52.210]  It's interesting on the cornflakes.
[02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:55.970]  I smoke distillate honestly every day, all day.
[02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:56.810]  Oh, I mean, I smoke a lot of-
[02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:57.650]  No flavors?
[02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:59.850]  I mean, I do put terps in it sometimes,
[02:05:59.850 --> 02:06:01.610]  but honestly, sometimes not.
[02:06:01.610 --> 02:06:04.290]  I mean, I don't mind raw distillate.
[02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:07.130]  And I know Jeff actually took a nice,
[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:11.090]  he tried to take a nice half gram dab of some distillate.
[02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:13.410]  One night I had the secret session.
[02:06:13.410 --> 02:06:15.850]  I just walked up, I had this half gram distillate
[02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:16.690]  left in my pocket.
[02:06:16.690 --> 02:06:19.050]  I was like, who wants to take this right now to the dome?
[02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:20.890]  And Jeff honestly was like-
[02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:21.730]  I'll do that.
[02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:23.650]  I'll take that dab, let's do this.
[02:06:23.650 --> 02:06:24.490]  So that was pretty cool.
[02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:25.930]  It seemed like you were on your way
[02:06:25.930 --> 02:06:27.130]  to ask a specific question.
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:28.890]  Did you get to ask what you were trying to ask?
[02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:29.890]  I like how Sam-
[02:06:29.890 --> 02:06:31.650]  I have a brain fart now.
[02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.210]  I don't even know.
[02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:36.210]  But I do want to say, wow, nice pressing.
[02:06:36.210 --> 02:06:37.810]  Look at that.
[02:06:37.810 --> 02:06:39.770]  It's all about this awesome-
[02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:41.090]  Rebel's glass.
[02:06:41.090 --> 02:06:42.250]  I mean, guys.
[02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:44.130]  His iron has little presses.
[02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:45.170]  These things are awesome.
[02:06:45.170 --> 02:06:48.050]  Let's give a big shout out to this local artist,
[02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.010]  Rebel's Glass.
[02:06:49.050 --> 02:06:51.570]  I brought my Rebel recycler with me, of course.
[02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:55.930]  It just so happens my little iron matches.
[02:06:55.930 --> 02:06:56.770]  Yeah.
[02:06:57.930 --> 02:06:58.970]  It kind of sold me now.
[02:06:58.970 --> 02:07:00.730]  I kind of need to get one now.
[02:07:00.730 --> 02:07:02.370]  Those little irons are adorable.
[02:07:03.210 --> 02:07:05.770]  It presses it so unbelievably.
[02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:08.010]  I've been trying to use tons of little tools
[02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:12.370]  and bottom of jars and little flat glass surfaces
[02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:16.490]  I could find, but this thing is perfect.
[02:07:16.530 --> 02:07:20.090]  You can press out a really wide piece of solventless.
[02:07:20.090 --> 02:07:21.930]  Let's explain what we're talking about a little bit.
[02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:24.010]  Because like I said, people are listening in on the art.
[02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:27.770]  So it's literally like a two inch by one inch,
[02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:29.610]  it really looks like a glass iron.
[02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:32.690]  So like an iron that you would iron your clothes with,
[02:07:32.690 --> 02:07:33.970]  but just glass.
[02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:36.690]  And you would heat that up to press out
[02:07:36.690 --> 02:07:40.770]  some of this full melt ice hash that we have here.
[02:07:40.770 --> 02:07:41.610]  That we're-
[02:07:41.610 --> 02:07:42.450]  Fold it between a piece of parchment paper.
[02:07:42.450 --> 02:07:43.290]  Yes.
[02:07:43.290 --> 02:07:44.130]  You can iron a little bit.
[02:07:44.130 --> 02:07:44.970]  Just press it out.
[02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:45.810]  Just press it out and make it flat.
[02:07:46.130 --> 02:07:46.970]  And then you're just ironing it out
[02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:47.810]  just like a shirt.
[02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:49.810]  Trying to get all the creases out of it,
[02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:51.290]  get it all flat and get turpy.
[02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:52.850]  Doesn't goop up on the nail.
[02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:53.770]  Doesn't get as funky.
[02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:54.610]  I'm gonna have you come over
[02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:57.210]  and iron my shirts for me sometime.
[02:07:57.210 --> 02:07:58.730]  With that little tiny iron.
[02:07:58.730 --> 02:08:01.530]  And the big difference is
[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:04.810]  that does not leave your nail black.
[02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.050]  Yes, that solventless does burn nice and clean.
[02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:08.450]  Lindsay, it looks like you're trying to sneak something in.
[02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:09.290]  What you got to say?
[02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:11.490]  Yeah, because I'm really sad how much you like those irons
[02:08:11.490 --> 02:08:13.130]  because there was two purple ones.
[02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:14.850]  Granny got one of them and there was another one
[02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:16.810]  and I was like, oh man, I should scoop that
[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:17.890]  because it matches his rig.
[02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.610]  And I was like, yo, he's not gonna want that.
[02:08:19.610 --> 02:08:21.170]  He's gonna be like, why'd you buy me an iron?
[02:08:21.170 --> 02:08:22.010]  And now you love it.
[02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:23.410]  And I'm like, crap, that one's gone.
[02:08:23.410 --> 02:08:24.850]  And I feel so bad.
[02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:27.250]  That's the way life goes sometimes.
[02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:29.130]  All right, we're talking about Terps.
[02:08:29.130 --> 02:08:29.970]  Ask away.
[02:08:29.970 --> 02:08:30.810]  Granny was on to something about Terps.
[02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:31.650]  Ask away.
[02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:33.090]  Discal it.
[02:08:33.090 --> 02:08:34.730]  Granny was thinking that we...
[02:08:34.730 --> 02:08:37.250]  Oh, no, my point was that
[02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:38.090]  it can be hard.
[02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:42.730]  I do believe you get a better medicated feeling
[02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:45.810]  once you add any of the Terps.
[02:08:45.810 --> 02:08:50.770]  Like I like in the morning, I like that lemon tea.
[02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:51.610]  Oh God, you know I love my lemon tea.
[02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:54.210]  Or the ghost train haze.
[02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:56.050]  That's wonderful for in the morning.
[02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:57.450]  Mornings are my two favorites, Granny.
[02:08:57.450 --> 02:08:58.290]  All the time.
[02:08:58.290 --> 02:09:00.090]  At night, zenberry.
[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:04.150]  Definitely, definitely.
[02:09:04.150 --> 02:09:05.830]  I mean, that's what I was saying.
[02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:09.510]  I know I personally feel that without terpenes,
[02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:13.030]  cannabinoids wouldn't transfer in your body the right way.
[02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:15.590]  The same way as, I don't want to say the right way,
[02:09:15.590 --> 02:09:18.630]  the same way as they do right now with terpenes.
[02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:20.390]  I know one thing is I love Terps.
[02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:21.230]  I love Terps too.
[02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:22.910]  I think all of us do.
[02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:23.750]  I'm gonna ask Mike a question.
[02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:24.990]  I like he got Mike's head in every direction.
[02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:26.990]  He was like, as the paparazzi came and asked him a question.
[02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:28.110]  We got you.
[02:09:28.110 --> 02:09:29.230]  My question, I forgot the question.
[02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:30.070]  I know.
[02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:32.590]  Do you, can you give me examples of like
[02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:35.270]  what specific terpenoids work for specific conditions?
[02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:36.110]  What they may help with?
[02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:37.630]  Because we already know, a lot of us know
[02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:40.550]  that like high THC strains will work well for seizures.
[02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:43.310]  High CBD works good for like epilepsy.
[02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:45.350]  Oh, he's got an article in his hand to refer to.
[02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:47.870]  I love it when people come with research.
[02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:49.030]  This is gonna be awesome.
[02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:51.110]  Guys, we're gonna learn what terpenoids will help
[02:09:51.110 --> 02:09:52.150]  with specific ailments.
[02:09:52.150 --> 02:09:54.510]  He's pulling out a chart, helping them find the right page.
[02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:57.030]  Shout out to his page, Turner Brett over there.
[02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:58.750]  So I guess the first example that I'm looking at
[02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:59.870]  right here is Humulin.
[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:02.430]  What would that kind of smell like?
[02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:04.870]  Humulin is common in a lot of sativa strains.
[02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:08.270]  And basically in terms of medicinal value,
[02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:10.390]  it's anti-tumoral, antibacterial.
[02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:12.110]  And it has anti-inflammatory properties.
[02:10:12.110 --> 02:10:13.870]  And Steep Hill Labs has done a lot of research
[02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:15.910]  on individual terpenes and their benefits.
[02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:17.310]  That's another place that I've done some research.
[02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:18.150]  Shout out to Steep Hill.
[02:10:18.150 --> 02:10:19.470]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:20.990]  One thing I can tell you about Humulin,
[02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:25.510]  it's also a natural, you don't wanna eat.
[02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:28.110]  It's like a diet pill almost.
[02:10:28.110 --> 02:10:28.950]  Abstinence suppressant?
[02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:29.790]  Yes, that's it.
[02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:31.110]  Thank you, brain fart.
[02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:33.390]  Can you give me a couple more examples?
[02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:34.350]  Like maybe one or two more?
[02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:35.510]  Because that's really interesting to me.
[02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:37.070]  And I'm sure our listeners would love learning
[02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.910]  about the terpenes as well.
[02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:41.430]  You can read all of this in THC Magazine.
[02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:42.910]  Yes, yes, I'm not trying to make them read
[02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:44.190]  this whole magazine, but I wanted to get
[02:10:44.190 --> 02:10:45.030]  at least two or three good examples in.
[02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:47.670]  No, for sure, just another shout out to THC Magazine.
[02:10:47.670 --> 02:10:49.510]  This is a quote from Steep Hill actually.
[02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:51.070]  Linalool is a critical precursor
[02:10:51.070 --> 02:10:52.630]  in the formation of vitamin E.
[02:10:52.630 --> 02:10:53.630]  It has been used in the treatment
[02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:55.030]  of both psychosis and anxiety,
[02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:58.070]  and as an anti-epileptic agent.
[02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:59.350]  Excuse me.
[02:10:59.350 --> 02:11:00.630]  What does that one smell like?
[02:11:00.630 --> 02:11:02.710]  Linalool is very floral, like lavender.
[02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:05.190]  Okay, all right, that's probably my least favorite terp.
[02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:07.030]  I really do not appreciate the smell
[02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:08.870]  of lavender and lilacs.
[02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:10.550]  It drives my nose crazy.
[02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:12.750]  It makes me wanna sneeze and pick my nose for some reason,
[02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:13.950]  like there's chunks in my nose.
[02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:15.990]  It smells like bathroom stuff,
[02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:18.190]  like your grandma's bathroom.
[02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:19.030]  Oh, granny, I love you sometimes.
[02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:20.790]  My bathroom doesn't smell like that,
[02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:23.150]  but it does smell like grandma's bathroom.
[02:11:23.150 --> 02:11:23.990]  I went to a restaurant.
[02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:25.310]  I wish I could smell your bathroom.
[02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.150]  That's weird, though.
[02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:27.510]  That's really weird.
[02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:29.710]  I went to a restaurant, somebody served me rose ice cream,
[02:11:29.710 --> 02:11:30.710]  and they asked me what I thought,
[02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:32.830]  and I said, it tastes like grandma's bathroom.
[02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:34.670]  They've never eaten rose ice cream again.
[02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:37.960]  I ruined that for them.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.680]  I guess, what common one that everybody loves,
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.480]  D-limonene, that lemony, really citrusy flavor.
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:44.320]  Sativa.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's my favorite.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:46.960]  It's said to be helpful with symptoms
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.320]  of depression and anxiety.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.040]  So, different terpenes are definitely useful
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:50.920]  for a lot of different things,
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.600]  and we're only really just starting to figure that out.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:53.440]  So, hopefully.
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.280]  Is that why we love it so much?
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.240]  Because it helps us not be anxious
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.720]  and helps us not be depressed?
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:59.080]  Yeah, that's why a lot of sativa strains
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:11:59.920]  are really uplifting.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.760]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:01.600]  They help with depression, exactly.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:04.040]  That's probably, Brett, what's your favorite terp?
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.560]  I'm gonna have to say limonene,
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.680]  or probably mercine.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.520]  Okay.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:11.720]  Mercine, I like mercine.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:13.440]  I like the pinene.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.120]  I probably go lemonene, too.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:16.960]  Okay.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.800]  I like that lemon as well.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.720]  All right, if you guys are growing,
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.520]  okay, I'm gonna reveal a grow tip
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:21.560]  that is a million dollar tip
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:22.800]  that I don't say a lot on the air.
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:25.960]  I've said this one time in a way previous episode.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.080]  If you've got a sativa strain
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.400]  that has lemony flavors and lemon characteristics,
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.520]  and you wanna bring out the D-limonene terpenoids,
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.440]  let it get a little bit too close to the light,
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:35.280]  and it will panic,
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.920]  and it will start creating D-limonene
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.560]  as a panic response and defense,
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.680]  and that'll bring out your lemony flavors.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.840]  And I learned this on accident
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:44.360]  by getting my plants too close to the light too many times,
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:45.800]  and I'm like, why are they always so lemony?
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:46.840]  And I was like, wait, those are the plants
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.000]  that almost got burnt,
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.880]  and I'm 90% sure that that's what's happening.
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:51.400]  That's from my experience.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.280]  I think getting the plants too close to the HPS light
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.400]  will bring out the limonene.
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.240]  So do it on purpose.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.080]  Drop your lemon, Jeffrey.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.160]  Get the light real close to that lemon, Jeffrey.
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.000]  I'm gonna do that.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:00.840]  I'm gonna bring it out for you.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.160]  You're putting the biggest smile on my face right now.
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:04.000]  You've always got a big smile.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.880]  We all are smiling.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.440]  Guys, that was a cool tip.
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.160]  Thank you for sharing that, Rasta Jeff.
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:11.000]  Devin Granny, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.280]  You know, it was just,
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:16.400]  what you just did is the reason I started listening to you.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.280]  It was your enthusiasm for cannabis.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.560]  I appreciate that.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.480]  Can I tell you how I found you?
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.320]  I think through the Traveling Stoner.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:26.520]  Well, that's how we got introduced.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.360]  Thank you, Lindsay.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.200]  That's how we got in touch.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.560]  And then we know Brett.
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:32.880]  He's the phone snatcher.
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.080]  Yeah, Brett's the real deal.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:38.320]  Have you subscribed THC Sam to the podcast?
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.720]  If he's not listening, I don't know what to do.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:44.000]  I might have to go hog time or something.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.760]  Brett will grab your phone and subscribe you to my podcast.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.720]  If you've got an iPhone and you're around Brett,
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:49.880]  you will open up your phone one day
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:51.800]  and you'll be like, when did I subscribe to a podcast?
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:54.080]  Grab your friend's phone and subscribe them
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:55.480]  to the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.320]  I definitely got a bit of,
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:57.400]  I've been lacking on the podcast game,
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.000]  so I will be subscribing and following this event.
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:00.760]  I can't expect everybody to listen
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.040]  to 140 episodes of me rambling.
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:03.880]  I can't expect everybody to.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:05.320]  Why, I'm almost there.
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.160]  You like it when you ramble.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.000]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:07.840]  Hashtag you like it when you ramble.
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:09.280]  Where's your podcast?
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.160]  Hey, guys, by the way, special shout out to Rasta Jeff
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.040]  for this podcast that aired on Monday.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:21.720]  I mean, this guy pulled it together and it was like,
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:24.440]  wow, what a great podcast.
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:25.960]  You are a pro.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:26.800]  Thank you.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.000]  And what she's referring to, you guys,
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.680]  is so I was gonna put the podcast together Sunday night.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:33.200]  I was like, I better throw an intro on that,
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:34.960]  put the memory card in the computer,
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:37.320]  put the part that we recorded at the Canyon into a show
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:39.440]  and then put an outro on it and post it up.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:41.160]  And I pulled out my memory card
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:43.440]  and it said files are unreadable.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:45.240]  So I had to pull a podcast together.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:46.480]  It was about eight or nine o'clock
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:48.200]  and the podcast usually drops at midnight.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:50.800]  So I had three or four hours to put together a podcast,
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:53.880]  record it, edit it up, air it, get it up on the website.
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:54.720]  And I pulled it off, you guys.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.400]  It was up there by 11.59.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.600]  So thanks for all the love.
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.440]  I appreciate that.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.760]  When I got the notification, I was like, is it an encore?
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.400]  And I listened, I was like, wow, kudos.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.120]  Luckily, I've got some notes prepared for,
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.160]  I try to stay one or two shows in advance.
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.800]  Actually, there's a show that'll come out before this one.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.360]  148 came out today.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.200]  This is 150.
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:18.120]  So I've obviously got one in the can ready to go.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.680]  So yeah, shout out to my friends
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:21.040]  that help me record podcasts all the time.
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.160]  I appreciate all of you guys,
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.840]  the guys that are here and not here
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.320]  for taking hours out of their day
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.960]  to come take dabs and record podcasts with me.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.360]  I appreciate each and every one of you guys.
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:30.200]  We love it.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:31.040]  Thank you so much for inviting us.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:31.880]  Thank you for having us.
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:34.120]  It's a tough job, really, guys.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:34.960]  I mean, honestly.
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.320]  I really appreciate it.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.920]  Granny, is that lollipop medicated?
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:41.960]  No, I wish it was, but Lindsey's donuts were medicated.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.800]  Nice.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:43.640]  Wait, what donut?
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:44.680]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.200]  Oh, I know.
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:47.560]  Well, last time, first of all,
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.960]  I tried to give you a donut last time on the last one.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.720]  Starfire Edibles, that's those little donuts.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.720]  And I have shout out to Starfire Edibles.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:59.920]  They are made with solventless hash
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:01.520]  and they are incredible.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:03.720]  She makes amazing different flavors.
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.320]  She makes cake cones.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:06.320]  I won't go into it too much,
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:08.160]  but Starfire Edibles, shout out to them.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.000]  Shout out, shout out.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:09.840]  Sounds like you like it.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:10.680]  For sure.
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.520]  Sounds like you like it.
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:12.360]  That was hard to say.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:13.200]  They're my favorite edibles right now, actually.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.040]  Nice.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.880]  For sure.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:15.720]  All right, I'm afraid of edibles.
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:16.800]  The people that listen to the podcast
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.160]  know that I ate way too many edibles one time
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.200]  and I've been kind of gun shy since then.
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:23.600]  All right, I wanna go this direction again.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:26.240]  I was telling Granny about how I found her.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:28.200]  I was scrolling through Facebook one day
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.560]  and there was no sound in the video,
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:30.640]  so I'm gonna cut the sound out,
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:31.880]  but they're like, check out this lady.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:34.040]  And it was just somebody reposting your video.
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:36.000]  You took a big ass dab,
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.080]  like a dab that I would take probably a half a gram,
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.360]  at least a 0.3, maybe a 0.5.
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:42.160]  You sucked that dab in, you held it in,
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:44.680]  you chugged a beer, you chugged a shot,
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:47.000]  and then you grabbed, you blew out your dab
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.800]  and you grabbed your nectar collector
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:52.600]  and did another dab and blew that one out
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:55.320]  and smiled at the camera like nothing had happened.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:56.720]  That's kind of what I'm known for.
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:57.560]  And that's what she does.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.720]  I guess you should not be proud of it, but I am.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.080]  Because really, can you see your mother
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:09.760]  or your daughter doing a knockout and smiling?
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:12.920]  And then most people think, oh, she's laid out.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.880]  I'll come back and do another big dab for you.
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:19.720]  But she's, we've been, we probably smoked,
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.200]  there's six people here in this group,
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:23.040]  we probably smoked three or four grams of Cheddar
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:24.720]  in the hour that we've been hanging out here.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:26.520]  There's been some energy consumed.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:29.120]  And Granny takes a lot of big dabs, she is not shy.
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:30.120]  She's taking more dabs than me
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:31.640]  because I feel like I try to keep my throat
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:33.280]  a little composed for the show.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.880]  But Granny goes in, she takes some big old dabs.
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.280]  We all have been dabbing out.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.280]  In fact, everybody needs to watch social media
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.880]  for the best group dab ever.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:43.720]  Who's gonna post that?
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:44.560]  Who's a-
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:46.640]  I'm gonna post it. He already did, actually.
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:48.520]  It's about to go up on the THC Magazine account,
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:49.520]  the Hemp Connoisseur.
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:51.320]  Oh, wow, yeah, make sure you follow
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:53.360]  the Hemp Connoisseur account on Instagram
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.640]  so you can see our group dab video.
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:56.520]  There were six of us doing a big dab
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:57.960]  over here at the Cana Canyon.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.040]  It was glorious.
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:01.240]  It's still very smoky in here.
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:02.080]  Yeah.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:02.920]  It's a little cloudy.
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:04.000]  They actually cracked the door.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.040]  Oops, when you smoke out the smoke lounge.
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:10.080]  I feel like every time we come here,
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:11.600]  they crack the back door.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:12.680]  I take big dabs.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:14.920]  They had to clean out their email a couple of times,
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.000]  their rig, because I've globbed it all up.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.280]  They've been like, who's here globbing?
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:19.120]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.720]  Oh, Jess in the corner.
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:22.520]  Oh, shit, was I that loud?
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.240]  Yeah, I take big dabs.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.560]  So that's how I found Dabbing Granny.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:26.880]  It was watching her do strikeouts,
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.520]  and then somebody was like, she lives in Springs.
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:29.360]  And I was like, what?
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:31.000]  And they're like, she shops at Elevate.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.400]  And I started following you, and I was like,
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:33.880]  this lady and I cross paths.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:35.640]  We go to all the same places.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.160]  You shop at Green and Healthy Wellness occasionally.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.600]  You support all the dispensaries in town,
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:40.840]  which is one thing I love. Yes, I do.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:42.840]  I love that you don't just go pick one place
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:43.800]  and say that they're the best.
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:46.400]  I love that you go and learn and experience all the stuff.
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.640]  I kinda am a representative for the cannabis community,
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.640]  and so I'm gonna go all over.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:58.970]  I'm not gonna give one dispensary my plant count.
[02:18:58.970 --> 02:19:00.770]  It wouldn't be fair for somebody to say,
[02:19:00.770 --> 02:19:03.410]  oh, we own the Dabbing Granny.
[02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:04.770]  I'm a free agent.
[02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:08.410]  So I'm gonna kinda tell everybody what we're talking about.
[02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:10.490]  In Colorado, if you're a medical marijuana patient,
[02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:13.650]  you are allowed to grow a specific amount of plants
[02:19:13.650 --> 02:19:16.210]  based on what your doctor feels is appropriate,
[02:19:16.210 --> 02:19:18.690]  based on your medical condition,
[02:19:18.690 --> 02:19:21.450]  or honestly, based on how much money's in your pocket.
[02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:23.090]  It just costs more, honestly.
[02:19:23.090 --> 02:19:26.290]  So you pay for an elevated plant count is what we call it.
[02:19:26.290 --> 02:19:27.770]  That allows you to grow more plants
[02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:29.930]  and also to possess more cannabis.
[02:19:29.930 --> 02:19:32.530]  When you go to a dispensary in Colorado Springs,
[02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.890]  we are medical cannabis only,
[02:19:34.890 --> 02:19:37.210]  and the way that those dispensaries are able to grow
[02:19:37.210 --> 02:19:39.370]  is those plants that those patients have,
[02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:42.690]  they can allow the dispensary to grow those plants for them.
[02:19:42.690 --> 02:19:44.250]  We call it signing over your card,
[02:19:44.250 --> 02:19:45.810]  signing over your plants.
[02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:47.130]  You become a member.
[02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:48.370]  So that's what Granny's talking about
[02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:50.570]  is she's not gonna let anybody have her plant count.
[02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:51.650]  She's in charge of that.
[02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:52.810]  She is her own.
[02:19:52.810 --> 02:19:53.650]  She's a free agent.
[02:19:53.650 --> 02:19:54.490]  She grows on her own.
[02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:56.250]  None of these dispensaries own her.
[02:19:56.250 --> 02:19:57.090]  They don't have her plants.
[02:19:57.090 --> 02:19:58.570]  They can't brag about it.
[02:19:58.570 --> 02:20:00.490]  And hopefully, Granny's got a nice garden of her own,
[02:20:00.490 --> 02:20:03.770]  but that's none of our business unless she wants to tell us.
[02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:06.410]  I don't know the first thing about growing.
[02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:08.010]  I know a podcast that you can listen to
[02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:08.850]  that would probably be good.
[02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:09.690]  I've been listening.
[02:20:09.690 --> 02:20:10.530]  I've been listening.
[02:20:10.530 --> 02:20:11.490]  There's a very good podcast
[02:20:11.490 --> 02:20:15.090]  that has helped me with a lot of good tips.
[02:20:15.090 --> 02:20:15.930]  Episode number one.
[02:20:15.930 --> 02:20:17.530]  Give me your phone, I could show you.
[02:20:17.530 --> 02:20:18.450]  Yeah.
[02:20:18.450 --> 02:20:22.210]  So what gave you the idea to become the Dabbin' Granny?
[02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:26.570]  Well, I've always smoked.
[02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:31.110]  I've smoked long before.
[02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:36.110]  And this Dabbin' thing was pretty new
[02:20:36.390 --> 02:20:39.150]  about what, maybe two years ago.
[02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:41.350]  And at the dispensary I was going to,
[02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:43.030]  they kept saying, you need to try this.
[02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:44.390]  You need to try this.
[02:20:44.390 --> 02:20:48.190]  No, y'all are young boys with slap back hats.
[02:20:48.190 --> 02:20:49.390]  I'm not gonna try this.
[02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:50.230]  Uh-uh.
[02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:53.070]  This is not for me, I'm an old lady.
[02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:56.110]  Well, then actually it was the owner
[02:20:56.110 --> 02:21:00.270]  of the Canna Canyon, Aaron and Pete.
[02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:01.590]  They were like, come on, try it.
[02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:08.040]  You have a high tolerance.
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.080]  I wasn't too big on it
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.080]  because I didn't know what I was doing.
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:15.080]  Then in November, I got a portable email.
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.200]  Can I tell that story?
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.280]  You can definitely tell any story you want on this podcast.
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:21.200]  I'm gonna shout out to Dabato up in Denver
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:25.000]  because they're the ones that encouraged me
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:26.520]  to go in front of a camera
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:28.920]  when I didn't know what the hell I was doing
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:31.400]  and do dabs and smile and talk.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.520]  And when I was like, but why should I do it?
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:36.120]  And they're like, because people will like you.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:36.960]  They should.
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.280]  And people like me.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.120]  I don't know why, but people like me.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.360]  I love you.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.840]  You've just got a personality that people wanna watch.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:44.680]  I'm gonna take you home tonight.
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:47.640]  You can take big old dabs and then you can handle it.
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:50.200]  And so there's several things that intrigue people,
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:52.040]  especially the normal people
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:54.440]  that are in Colorado taking dabs.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:55.920]  And the people that don't get to dab.
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:58.160]  And the people that when they do take dabs,
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:00.160]  it's a pea size and they get high as shit
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.400]  because they rarely get to dab.
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:04.000]  They're blown away by this old lady taking a big old dab.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.600]  Like that's like my grandma taking a dab.
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.960]  But now everybody wants to dab.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.280]  Yeah, and everybody wants to dab with you.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:11.120]  Yes.
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.600]  And I guess you keep it quiet that you're coming here
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:14.280]  because otherwise this place just fills up
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:15.600]  with people trying to meet granny.
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:17.560]  I have learned don't say where I'm going.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:18.560]  Yeah.
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.560]  Actually, speaking to that,
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.920]  in the August issue of the Hemp Connoisseur,
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:22.480]  I had the chance to do an interview
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:24.200]  with Dab and Granny over here.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.040]  And we got to talk about kind of how she started
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.880]  with cannabis and exactly what you just talked about,
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.040]  kind of how she's changing what it looks like
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:31.000]  to consume hash.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.840]  And it's changing what it looks like
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:34.360]  to use a blowtorch to heat up the nail,
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:35.320]  to take a big dab.
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:38.160]  And it also changes what people's opinions look like
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:39.760]  of what a high tolerance looks like,
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:42.360]  what actually functioning on that high tolerance looks like.
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:45.120]  So it's really a really cool thing to see.
[02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:46.720]  And I think a lot of people are really enjoying it,
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:48.080]  hence her massive following.
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:49.360]  Massive following.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.640]  How many Instagram followers do you have now, Granny?
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:54.440]  I woke up this morning to 151.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:56.400]  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:57.240]  Only 151?
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:59.520]  151, that sucks.
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.360]  And I have not met Dick.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.600]  No, dude, she just hit 150 like two days ago.
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:04.440]  She got a thousand followers in like a day.
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:05.760]  She only got 151?
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.600]  Stack it.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:11.600]  Wait, you're telling me she only has 150 people?
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:12.600]  No, I'm joking.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:14.200]  I'm fucking around.
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:15.520]  She deserves way more, but like still.
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.680]  You have to add the K to the end.
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:17.880]  People don't understand that.
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:20.320]  I have 151,000 followers.
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:21.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:26.160]  Can I tell you guys a funny story about a rabble house?
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:28.040]  Some of our followers might not know,
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:32.040]  and if you just say 151, they might just think,
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:32.880]  they're not understanding.
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:33.720]  That's not a big following, you rip.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:36.880]  And I haven't even been on social media a year.
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:37.880]  But last night.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:41.000]  151,000 followers in one year, Granny.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.080]  I know, it's amazing.
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:42.920]  It's crazy.
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:46.680]  And then look, I'm on Periscope, Snapchat.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.080]  All you do is.
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:48.920]  Talk.
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:49.760]  And dab.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.120]  And do just what we're doing here.
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:55.120]  But you know the best thing about being dabbing Granny?
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:56.160]  This right here.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.800]  Look how many young people I have brought together tonight.
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:01.960]  And now.
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:04.160]  And have exchanged a conversation.
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:05.000]  I met Sam tonight.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:05.840]  Good to meet you.
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:08.880]  Guys, it's not all about getting stoned.
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:10.080]  Please don't think it is.
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.160]  Yes, we're giggling and stuff, but no.
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:13.840]  It's pretty good, it's some knowledge though.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:14.680]  Lots of knowledge.
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:15.720]  It's a community education.
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:18.320]  There's so much going on.
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:19.920]  I think we might've heard you, Chris.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:20.760]  Yeah, my bad.
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.200]  You guys are cool over there.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:23.160]  Everyone's so relaxed in this place.
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.840]  Everyone's just on the couches, just chilling.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.040]  I love the vibe in here right now.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:27.960]  There's some revolution playing in the background.
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.560]  It's kind of hard not to after two dozen dabs.
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.880]  Yeah, everyone's just kicking it.
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.800]  Granny, we cut you off on your story, I apologize.
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:35.640]  Oh yes.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:37.760]  I needed butane.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:41.600]  What dabber doesn't need butane?
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:45.240]  Not to blast dabs, but for my torches.
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:47.840]  So I was on Hancock and Delta.
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:52.560]  And I seen Rasta colors and it said,
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:57.560]  hops, crops, gift shop, no red card needed.
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:00.320]  Okay, they'll sell butane, right?
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:01.160]  Yep.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:03.760]  I walk in the door and there's somebody on a couch
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:06.240]  and it's not the Canna Canyon vibe.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.840]  It's more like dab lounge, family joint kind of vibe.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.320]  Yeah, bar room kind of vibe.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.680]  And a person on the couch goes, you look familiar.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:18.760]  And I said, yeah, I'm the dabbing granny.
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.080]  And I wasn't tooting my horn or anything.
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.880]  So I said, do you have butane?
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:26.640]  And the girl goes, yeah.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:28.800]  And she was kind of attitude with me.
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.680]  And she said, if I turn you on to a dab, can I record it?
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.360]  And I said, sure, I don't care.
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.640]  So she's recording and she goes, she says she's famous.
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:43.920]  I hope it was worth the wait.
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.760]  She dabs me, doesn't carve it
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:51.520]  and lifts the damn joint off the pipe.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.440]  And I just go, peace.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.800]  You're not supposed to carve a nail.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.520]  No, you just lift the drop down right off the nail, right?
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:00.560]  That's just weird.
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.120]  It was very weird.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.760]  They didn't like me there.
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:05.480]  Why, what did you do to them, granny?
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:06.760]  I don't know.
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.560]  She says she's famous.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.120]  I'm like, well, I didn't say I was famous.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:13.160]  I said I was the dabbing granny.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:15.520]  Yeah, rude people.
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:17.880]  Don't be rude to people, especially the dabbing granny.
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.760]  She's the dabbing granny.
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.240]  Well, then somebody made a comment.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:23.400]  Granny, don't go there.
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:26.720]  Somebody was just killed in the parking lot there last week.
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:31.240]  All right then, shout out to the Cannon Canyon.
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.840]  Nobody has been killed here.
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:33.680]  No. Ever.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.320]  How can you hate on a sweet lady
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:39.560]  who brings a basket of awesome treats
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:40.400]  everywhere she comes with it?
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:41.960]  She's got a basket of snacks over there.
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:44.400]  Not only does she bring a basket of turfs,
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:49.040]  she literally brings a basket of all candy greatness
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:50.880]  you could possibly think of.
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:51.720]  Wait, there's candy?
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:52.560]  Can I have some?
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.400]  There is.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:55.320]  Granny said there's always candy.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:57.520]  That is granny's basket right there of goodness.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.360]  Goodness.
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.080]  She brought a basket of snacks.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:04.080]  Those were hard words for my brain to make happen, dude.
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:05.160]  Basket of snacks.
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:07.560]  I'm good on a lollipop.
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:09.680]  I appreciate you, though.
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:11.440]  Where's my granny?
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:12.280]  You confused him.
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.850]  You really are my granny.
[02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:16.690]  It's amazing.
[02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:18.210]  I'll eat some sugar, baby.
[02:27:18.210 --> 02:27:19.530]  I'll take one.
[02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:21.570]  How nostalgic are sugar babies?
[02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:23.570]  Shout out to Lindsey for bringing people snacks
[02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:24.450]  and being awesome.
[02:27:24.450 --> 02:27:26.530]  Shout out to granny for bringing a basket of snacks.
[02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:28.530]  I don't think I've ever used a sugar baby,
[02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:30.730]  but I'm gonna try it because I need some sugar, baby.
[02:27:30.730 --> 02:27:33.330]  Shout out to Chris for getting me this shirt, actually.
[02:27:33.330 --> 02:27:36.210]  Chris has good taste.
[02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:37.530]  Well, obviously.
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:42.460]  Lindsey's blushing.
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:44.060]  I never get to see Lindsey blush.
[02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:44.900]  That's great.
[02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:47.500]  She's blushing is what I said, no one else caught.
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:51.500]  I actually really wanted to blush that day in the car
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:52.780]  with the...
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:54.340]  All right, we're gonna move forward, man.
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:57.140]  Oh, we've got Daven granny here on the podcast with us.
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:27:57.980]  Hmm.
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:02.300]  Jeff is blushing.
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:04.860]  Jeff is in stress.
[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:06.500]  I just wanted to watch him do that back.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.980]  You see that?
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:10.660]  Good one, trolling Lindsey.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:12.140]  I know, I have no doubt.
[02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:13.860]  Daven's face red.
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:14.700]  That's beautiful.
[02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:15.780]  So these sugar babies,
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:17.460]  he's trying to switch it.
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:20.340]  I can't believe what's going on here.
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:22.780]  I am so excited right now.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.460]  Oh, you shouldn't eat these while you try to talk.
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:26.060]  You can't chew with those in your face at all.
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:26.900]  That's gonna be weird.
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:32.510]  I'm gonna let him try to chew these real quick
[02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:35.710]  while I stare down at Jeff and wanna know
[02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:38.910]  what this whole conversation is about.
[02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:43.150]  Because I know Lindsey over there is giggling like no other.
[02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:45.150]  The conversation that happened in the car?
[02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:46.070]  Oh.
[02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:47.070]  Inside joke.
[02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:48.070]  It's about the car.
[02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:50.310]  What happened to the car stays in the car?
[02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:52.430]  My car has now became Vegas.
[02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:53.750]  We're gonna name my car Vegas.
[02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:55.270]  We're gonna name my car Vegas.
[02:28:55.270 --> 02:28:58.710]  I was honestly just trying to make you blush back
[02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:59.750]  just because.
[02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:01.430]  We did experience one thing in the car though.
[02:29:01.430 --> 02:29:04.430]  I don't like it when the person in the seat behind me
[02:29:04.430 --> 02:29:06.430]  tries to use a dab torch.
[02:29:06.430 --> 02:29:08.510]  Because I've got like four foot long dreadlocks
[02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:11.390]  and that freaked me the fuck out completely.
[02:29:11.390 --> 02:29:13.870]  So that's funny because then on the last podcast
[02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:16.470]  when someone was sitting behind me on the couch
[02:29:16.470 --> 02:29:17.950]  and they were using a torch and I looked at you
[02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:19.670]  and I was like okay, you're right, that's weird.
[02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:20.510]  I don't like that.
[02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:22.230]  You're like ooh, I could just be a candle in a minute here.
[02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:23.070]  This is weird.
[02:29:23.070 --> 02:29:24.430]  Yeah, I was like where are my dreads down?
[02:29:24.430 --> 02:29:26.110]  Is there one of them loose?
[02:29:26.110 --> 02:29:27.510]  Do I have all of them still?
[02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:31.310]  I don't smell burning hair, we're okay.
[02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:34.070]  Wow, right now we have three dreads
[02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:35.710]  to three non-dreads right here.
[02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:37.750]  And Camille's over there so that's more than shit.
[02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:40.230]  And Camille's over there, we're over, we're on.
[02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:41.150]  Team dreadlocks.
[02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.990]  Team dreadlocks.
[02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:43.190]  Mind.
[02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:44.750]  Might have to convert.
[02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:45.590]  Might have to convert.
[02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:46.750]  Brandy, what are you doing right now?
[02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:48.470]  Would you like to explain what's happening to us?
[02:29:48.470 --> 02:29:50.430]  Sam, will you hold the mic to her face so that she can?
[02:29:50.430 --> 02:29:52.190]  I am terping up.
[02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:55.760]  I don't even know what it is.
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.360]  It's some Viola Shatter.
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:29:58.680]  I like the paper.
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:29:59.520]  What's the other thing in your hand though?
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.240]  And that comes from Oil Slick, by the way.
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:02.800]  That's how I got to know Oil Slick
[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:05.920]  because I admired this beautiful Shatter paper.
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:07.200]  Shout out to my friends at Oil Slick.
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.360]  Those are good friends of mine.
[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:09.880]  Shout out to Josh and the entire Oil Slick.
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:10.720]  I love you guys.
[02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:12.320]  I love Josh's mustache.
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:13.160]  They're nice people.
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:14.880]  The coolest mustache you'll ever find.
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.480]  Anyway, so I got to know him
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:17.760]  because of the parchment paper.
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:21.600]  So some Viola, which needs to be kicked up a notch.
[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.600]  It's not real flavorful.
[02:30:30.330 --> 02:30:33.050]  That's my second or third favorite right there.
[02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:33.890]  The Durban Poison.
[02:30:33.890 --> 02:30:35.010]  I love Durban Poison.
[02:30:35.010 --> 02:30:36.850]  It's so distinguishable.
[02:30:36.850 --> 02:30:38.730]  It's one of my favorite flowers to smoke.
[02:30:38.730 --> 02:30:39.570]  Exactly, that's why.
[02:30:39.570 --> 02:30:42.610]  But honestly, I don't enjoy the terps.
[02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:43.450]  Really?
[02:30:43.450 --> 02:30:44.290]  Oddly enough.
[02:30:44.290 --> 02:30:47.490]  It hits my tongue where it's overpowering to my tongue.
[02:30:47.490 --> 02:30:51.330]  What was the combination you had last week that you was like?
[02:30:51.330 --> 02:30:53.530]  It was the Durban Poison on some Shatter.
[02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:55.290]  I don't remember what the Shatter was,
[02:30:55.290 --> 02:30:57.250]  but there's that licorice anise flavor.
[02:30:57.250 --> 02:30:59.450]  It's too overpowering within the terps.
[02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:00.930]  The flowers are amazing.
[02:31:00.930 --> 02:31:03.930]  I love the Lemon G, the Ghost Train Haze,
[02:31:03.930 --> 02:31:06.170]  the OG Kush, the Paradigm,
[02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:08.810]  the whatever, there's a berry with Zenberry.
[02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:09.650]  I like that.
[02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:10.490]  Zenberry is out of control.
[02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:11.850]  The other ones you brought last week,
[02:31:11.850 --> 02:31:13.130]  the ones you brought to Secret Sesh,
[02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:14.530]  loved every one of them.
[02:31:14.530 --> 02:31:16.770]  The Durban Poison, my tongue doesn't agree with it.
[02:31:16.770 --> 02:31:18.090]  Oh, Secret Sesh.
[02:31:18.090 --> 02:31:19.450]  Did you go to Durban Poison?
[02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:20.410]  Secret Sesh.
[02:31:20.410 --> 02:31:22.250]  No, the Durban Poison and then there's
[02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:24.170]  the Gorilla Blue No. 4.
[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:26.170]  Will it happen?
[02:31:26.170 --> 02:31:27.850]  Yeah, sorry, I was trying to go quickly
[02:31:27.850 --> 02:31:28.690]  so that Brett could talk.
[02:31:28.690 --> 02:31:29.530]  Sorry.
[02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:30.370]  I was trying to cut myself off.
[02:31:30.370 --> 02:31:32.130]  I was trying to get in there quick.
[02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:33.330]  But I wanted to say first.
[02:31:33.330 --> 02:31:34.170]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:35.290]  I just wanted to go in there first.
[02:31:35.290 --> 02:31:38.410]  But shout out to Secret Sesh.
[02:31:40.050 --> 02:31:42.370]  No, that's why I'm kind of having issues over here.
[02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:44.010]  I'm like, which one do I talk into?
[02:31:44.010 --> 02:31:45.730]  So Granny is now taking a dab.
[02:31:45.730 --> 02:31:47.290]  She's got a healthy size dab there.
[02:31:47.290 --> 02:31:50.130]  That's gotta be, that's a good dab.
[02:31:50.130 --> 02:31:51.890]  That's .2, .25.
[02:31:52.530 --> 02:31:53.570]  And they're gonna drop the turps.
[02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:55.930]  She's got a little, are you just gonna pour it on?
[02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:57.410]  Oh, I'm impressed.
[02:31:57.410 --> 02:31:58.250]  Just ballsy.
[02:31:58.250 --> 02:32:00.610]  Sam's got a little, a small dram vial,
[02:32:00.610 --> 02:32:03.010]  like a quarter dram vial of turpines.
[02:32:03.010 --> 02:32:05.850]  And he just poured the turps directly onto the dab
[02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:08.010]  and he nailed it like a freaking Olympian.
[02:32:08.010 --> 02:32:08.850]  That's gorgeous.
[02:32:08.850 --> 02:32:09.690]  That is a beautiful dab.
[02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:13.850]  He would get a tan in the dab Olympics.
[02:32:13.850 --> 02:32:15.290]  It's just not my favorite.
[02:32:15.290 --> 02:32:20.290]  I'm gonna try to bring the clear Durban Poison.
[02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:22.450]  I'm not mad at you for anything.
[02:32:22.450 --> 02:32:23.650]  I'm just saying that's, you know.
[02:32:23.650 --> 02:32:24.490]  There's never hate.
[02:32:24.490 --> 02:32:27.770]  Yeah, it's just, you know, that's not my flavor.
[02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:29.210]  Oh, Granny grabbed the e-mail.
[02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:30.050]  The thing is milky.
[02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.890]  She's capping it.
[02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:32.210]  She's like a champion over here.
[02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:33.250]  What?
[02:32:33.250 --> 02:32:34.970]  This is when you need the video.
[02:32:34.970 --> 02:32:36.610]  Oh, holy shit.
[02:32:36.610 --> 02:32:37.770]  You should have saw that cloud
[02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:38.970]  that just came out of her mouth.
[02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:40.490]  Yeah, you should have just heard that.
[02:32:40.490 --> 02:32:41.330]  Oh, I was out of here.
[02:32:41.330 --> 02:32:42.490]  She shakes her head.
[02:32:42.490 --> 02:32:43.970]  She's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:32:43.970 --> 02:32:45.170]  She points at her nose.
[02:32:45.170 --> 02:32:46.690]  She's like, no, that didn't go out of my mouth.
[02:32:46.690 --> 02:32:47.850]  That came out right out of my nose.
[02:32:47.850 --> 02:32:48.690]  Holy shit.
[02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:50.130]  Most people would be coughing by now.
[02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:53.050]  I would say that would have burned my nose.
[02:32:53.050 --> 02:32:54.330]  She said she has tears in her eyes.
[02:32:54.330 --> 02:32:56.610]  But yum.
[02:32:57.690 --> 02:32:59.050]  Tears of yum.
[02:32:59.050 --> 02:32:59.970]  Yes, tears of yum.
[02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:00.810]  Tears of terps.
[02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:01.850]  Terp tears.
[02:33:01.850 --> 02:33:02.930]  Hashtag terp tears.
[02:33:02.930 --> 02:33:04.330]  Oh, that might be a new one.
[02:33:04.330 --> 02:33:05.170]  Yeah.
[02:33:05.170 --> 02:33:06.010]  Terp tears.
[02:33:06.010 --> 02:33:06.850]  That's probably like a .3 dab.
[02:33:06.850 --> 02:33:08.810]  I want to ask Granny how long she's been consuming cannabis
[02:33:08.810 --> 02:33:11.890]  as soon as she quits choking on this mini dab.
[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:13.330]  Since she was 14.
[02:33:13.330 --> 02:33:14.770]  Did she say 14?
[02:33:14.770 --> 02:33:17.770]  But keep in mind, that podcast never happened.
[02:33:17.770 --> 02:33:19.210]  No, I'm telling you, since she was 14,
[02:33:19.210 --> 02:33:20.050]  I think I know that actually.
[02:33:20.050 --> 02:33:20.890]  It is.
[02:33:20.890 --> 02:33:21.930]  It's, Lindsay is correct.
[02:33:21.930 --> 02:33:22.770]  Killing it.
[02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:24.450]  A freshman in high school.
[02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:25.490]  I know Granny trivia.
[02:33:25.490 --> 02:33:26.330]  Let's do this.
[02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:27.170]  You want sugar, baby?
[02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:28.170]  No, I'm good.
[02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:29.370]  I'm just kidding.
[02:33:29.370 --> 02:33:32.650]  That's how some of my giveaways are, trivia like that.
[02:33:32.650 --> 02:33:33.490]  When did I?
[02:33:33.490 --> 02:33:35.610]  No, I think we actually just had that conversation
[02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:38.530]  when you were at the shop last.
[02:33:38.530 --> 02:33:39.370]  Probably.
[02:33:39.370 --> 02:33:40.210]  I think that was.
[02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:41.050]  Why?
[02:33:41.050 --> 02:33:42.810]  Oh, I met another nice glass blower.
[02:33:42.810 --> 02:33:43.970]  Let's shout him out.
[02:33:44.970 --> 02:33:46.410]  Mr. Bojangles.
[02:33:46.410 --> 02:33:47.330]  Oh, yes.
[02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:48.650]  That dude deserves a shout out.
[02:33:49.410 --> 02:33:52.170]  Yes, Logan and Cody.
[02:33:52.170 --> 02:33:53.450]  Yes, Cloudy Glass.
[02:33:53.450 --> 02:33:55.210]  They do a lot of Periscopes.
[02:33:55.210 --> 02:33:57.010]  If you follow them on Periscope,
[02:33:57.010 --> 02:33:59.250]  you'll see them blowing some glass.
[02:33:59.250 --> 02:34:00.090]  Honestly.
[02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:02.410]  My number one alert is those guys on Periscope.
[02:34:02.410 --> 02:34:04.850]  They actually depend on their Periscope
[02:34:04.850 --> 02:34:06.130]  to sell their artwork.
[02:34:06.130 --> 02:34:06.970]  So give them a follow.
[02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:07.810]  Such good resources.
[02:34:07.810 --> 02:34:08.650]  Yes, they do.
[02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:10.290]  I love how social media,
[02:34:10.290 --> 02:34:12.450]  I'm sure Granny makes a decent income
[02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:13.450]  off of the social media,
[02:34:13.450 --> 02:34:15.210]  whether it be glass or clothing
[02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:16.210]  or whatever is sent to you.
[02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:17.050]  I'm sure you get.
[02:34:17.050 --> 02:34:17.890]  Oh, yes.
[02:34:17.890 --> 02:34:19.650]  A mailbox full of stuff every month.
[02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.250]  And Lindsay, I know you do a whole bunch
[02:34:21.250 --> 02:34:22.730]  of social media stuff.
[02:34:22.730 --> 02:34:23.570]  Yeah.
[02:34:23.570 --> 02:34:25.530]  And Chris and I met through social media.
[02:34:25.530 --> 02:34:26.890]  That's how everything happened.
[02:34:26.890 --> 02:34:29.370]  That's how I became friends with Bobo Blaster Co.
[02:34:29.370 --> 02:34:30.610]  Remember I used to say on the podcast
[02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:31.810]  and you said you would giggle.
[02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:32.650]  No, I'm past.
[02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:34.090]  Brett, I'm pretty sure we became friends on social media
[02:34:34.090 --> 02:34:35.130]  before we ever met.
[02:34:36.210 --> 02:34:37.050]  Definitely.
[02:34:37.050 --> 02:34:38.490]  Actually, I've been following you.
[02:34:38.490 --> 02:34:39.770]  I love the podcast level
[02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:41.170]  you've been putting out for a while.
[02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:42.010]  Well, thank you, bro.
[02:34:42.010 --> 02:34:42.850]  Actually, Brett.
[02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:44.810]  I'm gonna shout Brett out
[02:34:44.810 --> 02:34:46.850]  for being such a kind, loving person
[02:34:46.850 --> 02:34:48.170]  in the cannabis community.
[02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:49.010]  Thank you.
[02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:51.170]  When I jumped on the scene back in November,
[02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:52.650]  I didn't know what the hell I was doing
[02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:53.890]  and none of you, in fact,
[02:34:53.890 --> 02:34:54.810]  most people were like,
[02:34:54.810 --> 02:34:57.890]  where the hell did this woman come from?
[02:34:57.890 --> 02:35:01.730]  I still have this note that Brett wrote me
[02:35:01.730 --> 02:35:04.130]  with one of his first slaps,
[02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:05.250]  as the people call them,
[02:35:05.250 --> 02:35:07.690]  because you slap them up on everything,
[02:35:07.690 --> 02:35:10.450]  his light bulb, Mary's motivation,
[02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:13.730]  that just encouraged me to keep being positive and silly.
[02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:15.770]  And I have.
[02:35:15.810 --> 02:35:17.090]  So thank you, Brett,
[02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:18.690]  just for kind of saying,
[02:35:18.690 --> 02:35:19.530]  I'm so happy.
[02:35:19.530 --> 02:35:20.370]  Stick with it.
[02:35:20.370 --> 02:35:21.210]  I'm so happy we met.
[02:35:21.210 --> 02:35:22.050]  And I took a picture
[02:35:22.050 --> 02:35:22.930]  because I don't think he believed
[02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:25.050]  that I really kept that letter for that long,
[02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:26.250]  but I have.
[02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:27.450]  This is what I'm talking about.
[02:35:27.450 --> 02:35:28.890]  This is why I love Brett so much.
[02:35:28.890 --> 02:35:32.010]  This is how positive and just happy you always are.
[02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:33.210]  And every time I see you,
[02:35:33.210 --> 02:35:34.170]  you're never upset.
[02:35:34.170 --> 02:35:35.650]  You just, all right, let's do this.
[02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:36.690]  Let's say, here's Terps.
[02:35:36.690 --> 02:35:37.530]  Let's do this.
[02:35:37.530 --> 02:35:40.130]  I'm so positive all the time.
[02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:42.410]  His Instagram displays exactly that.
[02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:44.890]  Guys, follow, is it Mary's underscore motivation
[02:35:44.890 --> 02:35:46.370]  or Mary's motivation?
[02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:47.490]  Mary's underscore motivation.
[02:35:47.490 --> 02:35:49.250]  All right, follow Mary's underscore motivation
[02:35:49.250 --> 02:35:50.090]  on Instagram.
[02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.930]  Check him out in the morning.
[02:35:50.930 --> 02:35:51.770]  He takes a morning dab.
[02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:52.850]  He does a silly dance.
[02:35:52.850 --> 02:35:53.690]  He's got a dog.
[02:35:54.690 --> 02:35:56.970]  He can do handstand dabs.
[02:35:56.970 --> 02:35:57.810]  Thank you.
[02:35:57.810 --> 02:35:59.090]  I was just about to say to you,
[02:35:59.090 --> 02:36:02.050]  listen, I tried three times, okay?
[02:36:02.050 --> 02:36:05.090]  I just don't have a rig that will like,
[02:36:05.090 --> 02:36:06.730]  yours right to your mouth.
[02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:08.050]  What the hell is that?
[02:36:08.050 --> 02:36:09.090]  That was so perfect.
[02:36:09.090 --> 02:36:10.610]  I was like, dude, I'm never gonna be able to do that.
[02:36:10.610 --> 02:36:11.490]  I don't have a rig that's,
[02:36:11.490 --> 02:36:12.770]  it was just perfect height.
[02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:13.610]  I was like, I hate you.
[02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:15.050]  I have tried many times.
[02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:16.730]  The rig honestly is what did it.
[02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:17.570]  I was just looking at,
[02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:18.850]  I was stoned looking at the rig
[02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:21.010]  and I was like, how can I take a funny dab?
[02:36:21.010 --> 02:36:23.490]  And I looked at my Bob Marley poster on the wall,
[02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:24.370]  tapestry on the wall,
[02:36:24.370 --> 02:36:27.080]  and I'm like, well, my rig,
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.440]  maybe I could do a headstand
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:29.640]  and it'll reach right in my mouth.
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:31.600]  And honestly, at first try,
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:34.120]  I was like, honestly tried my first try and it worked.
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:34.960]  I was surprised as fuck.
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:36.040]  What happens when you think outside the box
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:37.720]  and do too many dabs?
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.920]  I have tried, Brett.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:40.240]  I'm not gonna lie.
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.520]  But my ass will not pop up over my head.
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:46.560]  I asked grumpy grandpa,
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.680]  will you give me a lift?
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:52.240]  And he said, you are not one of those 25 year old kids.
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:55.520]  No, I will not help you do a handstand dab.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.960]  Can I help you do a handstand dab
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:58.200]  before we leave tonight?
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:36:59.680]  Can we put some of these couch cushions
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.640]  on so we can all pull this out?
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:02.480]  And we'll film this shit.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:04.600]  Can we sign some waivers to our roster, Jeff?
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:06.400]  This is literally the keg stand of the dab world.
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:07.240]  This is my only responsibility.
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:08.080]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:08.920]  That's fine.
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:11.800]  The dab stand.
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:14.200]  The dab stand, holy crap.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:16.400]  I would love to see it, but I'm afraid to see it.
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.120]  So I wanna back up on two things.
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:21.600]  Grumpy grandpa?
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:22.440]  Yes.
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:24.200]  I fucking love it.
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:25.800]  Dabbing granny, not grumpy grandpa.
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:27.240]  Now, I'll tell you,
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:30.240]  when I first started doing dabbing granny,
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:33.280]  I have to blow my nose, dab, you know.
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:34.760]  All right, I'll talk for a second.
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:38.280]  I'm in love with the grumpy grandpa that's the best.
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:40.200]  He was like, have fun,
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:42.360]  but I don't want to be on the camera.
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:43.600]  And I respected that.
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:45.640]  And I was like, well,
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:50.640]  what do you want people to know you as?
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.400]  And he was like, well, just call me grumpy grandpa.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:57.040]  And I was like, okay, that it is.
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.440]  That's great.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:37:59.280]  That's perfect.
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.520]  On a scale of one to 10, how grumpy is grandpa?
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:05.160]  Actually, because he has such chronic pain
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:09.080]  and chronic illness, some days he's pretty grumpy.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:10.480]  He could be an 11, huh?
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:15.480]  But considering I've been with him since 1974
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:18.720]  and he still makes me laugh every day,
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.120]  he's not that grumpy.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:20.960]  That's awesome.
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:21.800]  That's true love.
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:22.640]  That is love.
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.600]  That's longer than I've been alive, granny.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:24.760]  Me too, that's pretty cool.
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:26.480]  He is my life partner.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:27.320]  That's awesome.
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:29.240]  You know, and it's good things and bad things
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:31.160]  as every relationship is, right?
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:32.360]  I like that he watched out for you
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.240]  and didn't let you do a handstand.
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:37.520]  He did not want to call 911 for his love today.
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:39.880]  He was like, nope, you're not going to do that.
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:41.680]  But I want to.
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:44.000]  We'll get it done.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:44.840]  We got this.
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:46.440]  We'll just make it look like an upside down dab.
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:47.680]  We've got editing.
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.520]  I've got iMovie.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:50.480]  We'll make something happen for you.
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:51.320]  All right.
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:52.680]  What state did you live in
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.800]  when you started consuming cannabis at the age of 14?
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:57.760]  I am an Iowa corn whore.
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:03.320]  Maybe better than Terpsilet somehow.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:04.800]  A corn whore and a Terpsilet.
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:05.640]  That's quite an evolution.
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:07.960]  What happens in the corn field stays in the corn field.
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:10.440]  That is, that's the first time that's ever been done.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.880]  Brad is from Illinois.
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:12.720]  Yeah, what happens is-
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:19.800]  I've never been to a corn field.
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:21.240]  They don't have hockey in Baltimore either,
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:22.760]  we talked about earlier.
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.400]  Hockey doesn't exist, Brett.
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:26.800]  Hockey exists everywhere.
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:27.640]  Go Blackhawks.
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:30.400]  The look on his face.
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:31.920]  You say hockey doesn't exist.
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:33.560]  How hard was it for you to get some cannabis
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:34.800]  when you lived in the corn?
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:36.800]  Was it where they just growing cannabis up in the corn also?
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.400]  Actually, I started meeting guys
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.080]  coming back from the Vietnam War.
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.200]  Ah, you told us about that.
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.400]  Yeah, that's where it all started.
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:47.040]  You know, I was exposed to first cannabis
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:48.800]  and then many other things.
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:50.400]  Slowly progressed.
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:51.240]  Yeah.
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:52.080]  Okay.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:52.920]  And at this point in my life,
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:55.760]  I can truly say with life experience,
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:57.920]  don't mess with that other shit.
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:39:58.920]  I can agree with that.
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:02.200]  I mean, okay, you young folks say
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.640]  you need your spiritual experiences with psychedelics.
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:06.720]  I respect that.
[02:40:09.890 --> 02:40:12.170]  And as far as like meth and stuff,
[02:40:12.170 --> 02:40:15.530]  ooh man, that's poison, stay away from that crap.
[02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:18.050]  Anything that anybody has to make, stay away from that.
[02:40:18.090 --> 02:40:20.290]  I know that sounds contradictory because we smoke turps,
[02:40:20.290 --> 02:40:22.650]  but we're extracting something from groan.
[02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:24.370]  The meth, you gotta put it together.
[02:40:24.370 --> 02:40:27.130]  Brett, are you just yoga time suddenly?
[02:40:27.130 --> 02:40:28.010]  All right, thumbs up.
[02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:28.850]  Here we go.
[02:40:28.850 --> 02:40:29.690]  Whoa.
[02:40:29.690 --> 02:40:30.530]  Gotta loosen up for them dabs.
[02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:31.370]  Just doing some bridges
[02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:32.410]  and then we're gonna do some big dabs.
[02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:34.210]  All right, I like the way you roll, buddy.
[02:40:34.210 --> 02:40:36.010]  He's prepping for an upside downer.
[02:40:38.010 --> 02:40:39.770]  Yoga dabs over here.
[02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:42.050]  All right, so Granny meets these handsome young men
[02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:44.410]  coming back from Vietnam and started smoking cannabis
[02:40:44.410 --> 02:40:46.290]  in Iowa out in the corn,
[02:40:46.410 --> 02:40:48.570]  raising hell, being a youngster.
[02:40:48.570 --> 02:40:50.690]  When did you move to Colorado?
[02:40:50.690 --> 02:40:54.450]  I've lived here 24 years now.
[02:40:54.450 --> 02:40:56.850]  Oh, so you were here before the cannabis revolution?
[02:40:56.850 --> 02:40:57.690]  Yes.
[02:40:57.690 --> 02:40:58.530]  Okay.
[02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:00.210]  But did I smoke cannabis?
[02:41:00.210 --> 02:41:01.050]  Yes.
[02:41:01.050 --> 02:41:01.890]  Oh, far before the revolution.
[02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:02.730]  Oh, of course.
[02:41:02.730 --> 02:41:03.570]  Guaranteed.
[02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:06.570]  I lived in Europe before I came here.
[02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:10.770]  They didn't have cannabis, but they had hashish.
[02:41:10.770 --> 02:41:12.130]  Plenty of hashish in Europe.
[02:41:12.130 --> 02:41:12.970]  Yeah, they don't smoke a lot of plants.
[02:41:12.970 --> 02:41:15.850]  Yes, no, they didn't have a lot of flour
[02:41:16.810 --> 02:41:19.970]  This has been a long time ago, and I'm telling things,
[02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:23.010]  I'm telling secrets, but I would, every now and again,
[02:41:23.010 --> 02:41:25.290]  get my hands on cannabis.
[02:41:25.290 --> 02:41:29.610]  Oh boy, did the Europeans love American cannabis.
[02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:30.450]  Oh, I bet.
[02:41:31.570 --> 02:41:38.460]  And I always, I just have always thought-
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:39.900]  We're like-minded folks.
[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:42.340]  We like to, you can always find, it's like we,
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:44.420]  if you get a new job, if you go to a new school,
[02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:47.060]  if you move to a new town, if you go to a new whatever,
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:49.100]  if you're an archer into archery,
[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:50.420]  when you go to that new archery class,
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:51.820]  whatever it is, if you're a glass blower,
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:53.380]  you walk in, if you're a glass blower,
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:54.780]  everyone smokes, bad example.
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:56.580]  But if you walk into most places,
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:57.940]  you can look around the room and be like,
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:00.820]  ah, that dude over there, he's a turpor just like me.
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:02.700]  I'm gonna go hang out and kind of feel the waters out.
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.540]  And when it's a break time,
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:07.100]  like, so you want to go fucking get some 420 on?
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:08.340]  And you can always just find
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:10.140]  the like-minded potheads in the group.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:12.180]  It's just because we put a vibe out.
[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:16.460]  We're, there's a few haters in the community,
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:20.180]  that's like every sect of life,
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:22.020]  you're gonna have a few bad people.
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:22.860]  Of course.
[02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:24.380]  But for the most part,
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:27.980]  the people in the cannabis community are happy people.
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:31.380]  We're loving people.
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:32.780]  We want to help each other.
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:35.460]  We want to help other human beings.
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:37.060]  And we love the earth.
[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:38.420]  We want to respect it.
[02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:40.140]  I mean, we're all pretty.
[02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:44.540]  We're all connected in that one way.
[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:47.460]  If we don't love, if we don't take care of the earth,
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:48.980]  we can't grow cannabis.
[02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:50.540]  Cannabis makes us more peaceful.
[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:51.580]  It makes us more connected.
[02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:53.300]  It makes us easier to love each other.
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:55.900]  You ever taken a big dab and been like, fuck that person.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:58.620]  You take a big dab and you're like, nah, it'll be okay.
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.820]  You're never angry as you're blowing out a dab.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:02.580]  No, I'm never angry.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:04.340]  I've never seen you angry.
[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:07.060]  Because you know, this is, think about it.
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:10.420]  You can be angry at somebody and know it's ugly.
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:11.860]  And I heard that.
[02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:13.060]  What are you popping over there, bro?
[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:13.900]  That's weird.
[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:15.900]  His piggy.
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:17.060]  You're popping your piggy.
[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:18.820]  He's popping his piggy.
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:20.860]  Let's just keep moving.
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:23.100]  Cause this is getting weird.
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:26.140]  But you know, you're so angry at your neighbor or whatever.
[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:29.780]  It's an anger is a pretty ugly emotion.
[02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:34.580]  Does your neighbor know that it's eating you up?
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:36.220]  Probably not.
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:37.380]  So who's it hurting?
[02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:38.220]  Yeah.
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:39.060]  He's renting space in your head for free.
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:40.340]  Give it up.
[02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:41.180]  It isn't worth it.
[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:42.300]  Yeah. Let it go.
[02:43:42.300 --> 02:43:43.500]  Go talk to him.
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:45.420]  Yeah. All right.
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:46.900]  Granny, you're awesome to have on the podcast.
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.580]  I like some of the stuff you say.
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:51.140]  You said a second ago that you're telling your dark secrets.
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:52.780]  What's something that you've never shared with anybody
[02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:54.100]  that you want to tell us here on the podcast?
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:54.940]  I'm going to put you on the spot like that.
[02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:56.460]  Cause I want to know what you're going to say.
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:43:57.500]  Killing it.
[02:43:57.500 --> 02:43:59.100]  She just did the hand on the chin thing
[02:43:59.100 --> 02:44:00.380]  and looked up at the sky.
[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:01.500]  I like this lady.
[02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:04.980]  Okay.
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:06.620]  I will say that I,
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:09.540]  obviously I've done a lot in my life
[02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:12.820]  and I have no criminal record.
[02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:15.460]  I'm still alive.
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:20.870]  And that amazes me when I think back at some.
[02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:25.870]  So I'm destined to be here right now as Dab and Granny.
[02:44:26.430 --> 02:44:27.270]  Guaranteed.
[02:44:27.270 --> 02:44:28.870]  We're all destined to be right here,
[02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:30.110]  right at this moment.
[02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:31.190]  Some of my favorite friends,
[02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:32.270]  even Sam, the new guy.
[02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:33.190]  Bro, I like your vibe.
[02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:34.430]  I like what you know.
[02:44:34.430 --> 02:44:35.310]  We're going to hang out more.
[02:44:35.310 --> 02:44:36.150]  Thank you for having me.
[02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.990]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.830]  Oh man. Thanks for coming.
[02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:38.710]  So we've been going for almost an hour.
[02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:39.870]  It's time to do that thing
[02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:42.590]  where we talk about everybody's social media connections.
[02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:43.990]  And I thank everybody for coming.
[02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.990]  So Dab and Granny,
[02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:47.230]  tell everybody how everybody can find you
[02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:48.070]  on all the social media.
[02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:49.230]  Let them know about the YouTube,
[02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:50.550]  Facebook, Instagram, everything.
[02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:52.630]  I'm on YouTube.
[02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:55.390]  I think I'm dabbing underscore granny.
[02:44:55.390 --> 02:44:58.630]  I'm on Instagram dabbing underscore granny,
[02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:59.470]  Snapchat.
[02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:04.070]  I'm on Facebook and I'm kind of liking this live stream
[02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.910]  and on Facebook.
[02:45:04.910 --> 02:45:06.710]  You do great Facebook live videos.
[02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:08.310]  I just started doing that.
[02:45:08.310 --> 02:45:10.510]  I don't have a lot of followers yet.
[02:45:10.510 --> 02:45:12.350]  It's only a few people and they like it.
[02:45:12.350 --> 02:45:13.870]  You'll probably take a dab on Facebook live
[02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:15.470]  as the end of this recording wraps up.
[02:45:15.470 --> 02:45:16.310]  Let's do that.
[02:45:16.350 --> 02:45:17.670]  We'll do it together.
[02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:18.510]  Definitely.
[02:45:18.510 --> 02:45:19.350]  Awesome.
[02:45:19.350 --> 02:45:21.230]  And obviously,
[02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:24.190]  because I am the dabbing granny,
[02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:27.750]  I consume a large amount of medicine.
[02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:29.550]  I have to have a few sponsors.
[02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:30.390]  So I'm gonna shout them out if that's okay.
[02:45:30.390 --> 02:45:31.790]  That was gonna be the next thing I did.
[02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:32.630]  I would love to hear that.
[02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:34.070]  First ones are Dabado.
[02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:36.670]  I know they take a lot of grief about their product,
[02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:38.030]  but as far as I'm concerned,
[02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:40.430]  there's many of those portable emails out there
[02:45:40.430 --> 02:45:42.870]  branded under many names.
[02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:45.070]  Any one of those companies could have come and said,
[02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:46.550]  hey, we like you.
[02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:47.670]  We're gonna help you.
[02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:48.510]  They didn't.
[02:45:48.510 --> 02:45:49.590]  Dabado did.
[02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:51.310]  I like Dabado.
[02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:54.750]  Ooze 420, they have pens, they have silicone things.
[02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:55.990]  They make exit bags,
[02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:58.350]  which you have to have at every dispensary
[02:45:58.350 --> 02:46:00.270]  here in Colorado.
[02:46:00.270 --> 02:46:03.750]  And then I'm gonna be repping Megatoke,
[02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:06.070]  which is smoking cannabis.
[02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:08.310]  So this is gonna be smoking flour,
[02:46:08.310 --> 02:46:10.790]  which is kind of different for me.
[02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:14.670]  So be watching for me to be doing some more Megatokes.
[02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:18.550]  Granny, how much hash do you smoke in one day on average?
[02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:19.950]  About four to five grams.
[02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:22.550]  Four to five grams of good quality shatter
[02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:24.510]  or live resin every day, you guys.
[02:46:24.510 --> 02:46:25.350]  That's amazing.
[02:46:25.350 --> 02:46:26.190]  That's impressive.
[02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:28.830]  She keeps up with me if she doesn't outdo me.
[02:46:28.830 --> 02:46:30.750]  My budget can't keep up with that.
[02:46:30.750 --> 02:46:32.790]  I told you, Nevada, here I come.
[02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:36.190]  And she means Nevada Avenue, you guys.
[02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:37.870]  You can find her up near Cimarron.
[02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:40.870]  That's why I have to have a few sponsors.
[02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:42.830]  I know people are like, well, you shouldn't do that,
[02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:44.470]  but I have to.
[02:46:45.270 --> 02:46:46.110]  So shout out to the sponsors.
[02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:47.710]  I love that this community is willing to sponsor each other
[02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:48.910]  and help each other out.
[02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:50.230]  It makes the wheels go around.
[02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:51.070]  That's right.
[02:46:51.070 --> 02:46:52.110]  Granny, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:53.870]  I look forward to having you on future episodes
[02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:55.390]  because I love your vibe.
[02:46:55.390 --> 02:46:56.590]  You need to have your own show.
[02:46:56.590 --> 02:46:58.390]  I hear that may be a possibility in the future.
[02:46:58.390 --> 02:46:59.990]  I'm going to encourage that.
[02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:01.310]  I'm being told not to talk too much about it,
[02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:02.310]  but you need your own damn show.
[02:47:02.310 --> 02:47:03.150]  That's what I think.
[02:47:03.150 --> 02:47:03.990]  I've said that before.
[02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.950]  You need a show.
[02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:05.790]  Thank you, Jeff.
[02:47:05.790 --> 02:47:06.630]  Anytime.
[02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:07.470]  We're gonna hang out and do some tabs.
[02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:08.430]  We're gonna do a Facebook Live together.
[02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:10.350]  Sam, thanks for joining me, dude.
[02:47:10.350 --> 02:47:11.190]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:12.030]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:14.350]  Remind everyone, oh, your first podcast.
[02:47:14.350 --> 02:47:15.190]  Nice.
[02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:16.030]  Thanks for coming.
[02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:18.350]  It's these guys' first podcast, too, kind of.
[02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:21.070]  1.5.
[02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:22.070]  First one was a practice run.
[02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:24.070]  Remind everybody where they can find you on social media
[02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:25.590]  and then tell us about the magazine.
[02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:28.710]  Me personally, it's at THC underscore Samuel.
[02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:29.550]  Excuse me.
[02:47:29.550 --> 02:47:30.550]  Yeah, THC underscore Samuel.
[02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:32.950]  And the magazine is at The Hemp Connoisseur.
[02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:33.790]  Awesome.
[02:47:33.790 --> 02:47:34.630]  Check them out, you guys.
[02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:35.470]  Make sure you follow The Hemp Connoisseur.
[02:47:35.470 --> 02:47:36.310]  It's a great magazine.
[02:47:36.310 --> 02:47:37.150]  Well made.
[02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:38.190]  Well printed.
[02:47:38.190 --> 02:47:39.070]  Brett, it's time.
[02:47:39.070 --> 02:47:39.910]  Grab the mic, buddy.
[02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:40.750]  Yo!
[02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:46.190]  This is the white turp, Tim.
[02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:50.030]  You guys, he's got a hat with a feather in it on.
[02:47:50.030 --> 02:47:51.590]  Come at you live.
[02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:53.270]  At the Cannon Canyon.
[02:47:53.270 --> 02:47:54.350]  At the Cannon.
[02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:57.710]  Down here we watch Jeff and the turps.
[02:47:57.710 --> 02:47:59.150]  You've always wanted to do this.
[02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.990]  I have, actually.
[02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.830]  You've always been crazy.
[02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:03.750]  And honestly, so I'm gonna throw this out there right now
[02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:05.310]  because I've never said this.
[02:48:05.310 --> 02:48:07.070]  And some of these people on the podcast
[02:48:07.070 --> 02:48:09.630]  are gonna fucking laugh and I'm gonna laugh.
[02:48:09.630 --> 02:48:12.030]  But dude, I've actually seen you before.
[02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:13.390]  This is like way back.
[02:48:13.390 --> 02:48:14.990]  Like this is before we even met.
[02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:18.270]  So he's intimidating.
[02:48:18.270 --> 02:48:20.350]  He's like a 6'6 dude.
[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:22.510]  6'5, like maybe 6'6 with the hair.
[02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:23.910]  I'm saying with the hat, with the dreads,
[02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:25.470]  you can get a little tall, man.
[02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:29.990]  And when you actually know what he does and who he is,
[02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:31.230]  he can be intimidating.
[02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:34.830]  I actually saw him at, it was some cannabis event.
[02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:38.270]  It was, had to be, I think Champs.
[02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:39.110]  Possible.
[02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:40.110]  Here in Denver.
[02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:46.630]  And I rasted Jeff that I have followed his genetics
[02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:47.710]  and shit for a while.
[02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:49.190]  And I couldn't even say what's up
[02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:51.430]  because I didn't even know what to talk about
[02:48:51.430 --> 02:48:54.290]  and even how to approach this.
[02:48:54.290 --> 02:48:55.650]  Like, let's take a dab.
[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:56.490]  Yeah, bro, yeah.
[02:48:56.490 --> 02:49:00.090]  I am so appreciative that you have asked me
[02:49:00.090 --> 02:49:00.970]  to be on your show.
[02:49:00.970 --> 02:49:01.930]  Like you have no idea.
[02:49:01.930 --> 02:49:03.050]  This is a dream come true.
[02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:04.690]  So thank you so much, man.
[02:49:04.690 --> 02:49:07.050]  Brett, at the end of the day,
[02:49:07.930 --> 02:49:10.170]  didn't this teach you that every one of us,
[02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:11.410]  we're all alike?
[02:49:11.410 --> 02:49:12.770]  We're all people, bro.
[02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:13.730]  It's the funny thing.
[02:49:13.730 --> 02:49:15.090]  So I've had actually people come up to me
[02:49:15.090 --> 02:49:16.730]  and it's like, I've seen you at a sesh a couple of times.
[02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:18.370]  I didn't want to say hi, but I didn't know what to say.
[02:49:18.370 --> 02:49:19.210]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:19.210 --> 02:49:20.250]  I've been in the same place, man.
[02:49:20.250 --> 02:49:21.090]  So.
[02:49:21.090 --> 02:49:22.010]  But first off, I appreciate it.
[02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:24.290]  I appreciate the admiration and the respect.
[02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:25.570]  I completely appreciate that.
[02:49:25.570 --> 02:49:26.770]  And it's returned.
[02:49:26.770 --> 02:49:29.890]  Bro, you are a lab manager for a well-known lab
[02:49:29.890 --> 02:49:32.250]  that makes one of my favorite products.
[02:49:32.250 --> 02:49:35.890]  Like, yeah, you guys are breaking ground every day.
[02:49:35.890 --> 02:49:37.570]  Evolab CO2.
[02:49:37.570 --> 02:49:39.250]  Evolab CO2 on Instagram.
[02:49:39.250 --> 02:49:40.090]  Follow us.
[02:49:40.090 --> 02:49:40.930]  Terps, terps, terps.
[02:49:40.930 --> 02:49:42.690]  We do have a lot of good terps.
[02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:44.930]  Yeah, and a backpack off him.
[02:49:44.930 --> 02:49:45.770]  We really do appreciate it.
[02:49:45.770 --> 02:49:46.690]  I really appreciate it.
[02:49:46.690 --> 02:49:47.690]  Having me on the podcast
[02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:48.530]  and everybody at the HemCon,
[02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:49.370]  so we appreciate it.
[02:49:49.370 --> 02:49:50.490]  We're going to get you guys on again
[02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:53.130]  to do an in-depth episode about terpenes,
[02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:54.130]  how terps are made.
[02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:55.250]  I got the perfect person.
[02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:56.290]  We're going to go in-depth.
[02:49:56.290 --> 02:49:57.810]  We're going to get you guys more terp nerds on here.
[02:49:57.810 --> 02:50:00.650]  Like a real knowledge than not a sit around.
[02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:01.490]  Right.
[02:50:01.490 --> 02:50:02.330]  Like some PhD doctors.
[02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:03.170]  Right, we'll do it here again.
[02:50:03.170 --> 02:50:05.010]  But I mean, we're going to get terpy on that one.
[02:50:05.010 --> 02:50:06.530]  We're just going to go real nerd-like
[02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:08.930]  so that only a few people even understand the terminology.
[02:50:08.930 --> 02:50:11.530]  Because those are some people's favorite episodes.
[02:50:11.570 --> 02:50:12.850]  Those used to be mine.
[02:50:12.850 --> 02:50:14.770]  Our bar audience gets divided by like
[02:50:14.770 --> 02:50:17.650]  the folks that love the sit arounds
[02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:19.610]  and the folks that love the like science
[02:50:19.610 --> 02:50:20.930]  and the folks that love the grow.
[02:50:20.930 --> 02:50:22.090]  There's kind of some divides,
[02:50:22.090 --> 02:50:23.610]  but I love it all so I do it all.
[02:50:23.610 --> 02:50:24.450]  Definitely.
[02:50:24.450 --> 02:50:25.290]  Yeah, Brett, thanks for coming, dude.
[02:50:25.290 --> 02:50:26.610]  I look forward to doing more podcasts
[02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:28.410]  with you and you both.
[02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:29.290]  Cannot wait.
[02:50:29.290 --> 02:50:30.130]  Yes, yes.
[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:32.130]  And thanks for being a fan boy.
[02:50:32.130 --> 02:50:33.650]  You guys, if you see me in an event,
[02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:34.490]  and I'm pretty sure I can speak
[02:50:34.490 --> 02:50:35.530]  for everybody at this table,
[02:50:35.530 --> 02:50:36.370]  we're just people.
[02:50:36.370 --> 02:50:37.970]  We get thirsty when we wake up.
[02:50:37.970 --> 02:50:38.970]  We got to pee in the morning.
[02:50:38.970 --> 02:50:41.210]  We like to take dabs around six o'clock.
[02:50:41.890 --> 02:50:42.730]  I want some food.
[02:50:42.730 --> 02:50:43.930]  Where does normal people walk up, say hi?
[02:50:43.930 --> 02:50:45.730]  If you do not say hi to me,
[02:50:45.730 --> 02:50:47.490]  and you know who I am,
[02:50:47.490 --> 02:50:49.370]  I will be very upset
[02:50:49.370 --> 02:50:52.330]  because I know eventually I will say what's up to you.
[02:50:52.330 --> 02:50:54.210]  And if you say the same thing I've said
[02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:56.210]  and you've heard this and you say this thing,
[02:50:56.210 --> 02:50:58.730]  I'm like, yo, bro, I've told you
[02:50:58.730 --> 02:51:00.050]  because this is me talking to you.
[02:51:00.050 --> 02:51:00.890]  Some people are shy.
[02:51:00.890 --> 02:51:02.690]  So come say what's up, let's dab.
[02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:03.530]  Honestly, let's do it.
[02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:04.970]  Brett's obviously not that shy.
[02:51:04.970 --> 02:51:06.330]  I get that I am 6'5",
[02:51:06.330 --> 02:51:07.730]  and I've got dreadlocks down to my,
[02:51:07.730 --> 02:51:08.730]  almost my knees.
[02:51:09.250 --> 02:51:11.330]  Yeah, yeah, I get that I could be intimidating.
[02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:14.170]  I usually got three or four people hanging out with me.
[02:51:14.170 --> 02:51:16.650]  When you're so well-known in the industry
[02:51:16.650 --> 02:51:17.930]  and you know what you're doing,
[02:51:17.930 --> 02:51:18.770]  and you want to learn from you.
[02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:20.690]  And then you hear that deep radio voice.
[02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:24.490]  It's like, what is behind that voice?
[02:51:24.490 --> 02:51:26.170]  Come say hello and I'll be your friend.
[02:51:26.170 --> 02:51:28.170]  We can hang out, we can take some dabs.
[02:51:28.170 --> 02:51:29.210]  We can take some selfies.
[02:51:29.210 --> 02:51:34.210]  That 1-900 Rasta Jeff podcast voice.
[02:51:35.810 --> 02:51:37.570]  1-900 Rasta Jeff.
[02:51:37.570 --> 02:51:38.450]  No, that doesn't happen.
[02:51:39.130 --> 02:51:39.970]  Don't do that, please.
[02:51:39.970 --> 02:51:49.120]  That's weird.
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:50.880]  Barry Manilow podcast voice.
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:51.720]  Oh, Barry Manilow.
[02:51:51.720 --> 02:52:01.320]  That's what he turns on.
[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:02.160]  Smash?
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:03.000]  Smash.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:03.840]  Oh, smash.
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:04.680]  Somebody on Facebook, I posted this.
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:05.520]  Squash.
[02:52:06.960 --> 02:52:07.800]  What are you gonna do?
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:08.640]  Are you gonna squash?
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:09.880]  If we were in New Jersey, it could be.
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:11.480]  You gonna squash at work, y'all?
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:12.320]  You gonna squash later?
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:14.160]  So I posted to Facebook that I was setting up
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:15.760]  to record a podcast with Dab and Granny.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:16.680]  And someone on Facebook,
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:19.080]  the first comment was, y'all gonna smash after?
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:21.960]  And she's like, what's smash?
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:24.480]  I know now.
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:26.120]  Probably not, I'm sorry.
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:28.320]  But if we do, there will be video.
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:29.600]  And we'll post it to Facebook
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:31.200]  and you guys will get to check it out.
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:33.760]  Facebook Live, right after the show.
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:36.840]  I didn't sign up for that.
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:38.800]  I don't think anyone in the room signed up for that.
[02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:41.240]  No, no, I didn't get paid enough for that tonight.
[02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.080]  I hope your grandpa's gonna be upset.
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:46.000]  All right, Chris, you got a microphone in your hand.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:46.840]  I do.
[02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:48.520]  Tell everybody your Instagram and or Snapchat
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:49.760]  and or social medias.
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:54.320]  And then also tell us a whole bunch about furniture.
[02:52:57.640 --> 02:52:58.480]  BoBoBlasterCo.
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:02.360]  Yeah, you can find me on Instagram.
[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:05.920]  My Snapchat, I don't even know my Snapchat name, honestly.
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:08.640]  I think I might have it listed on my Instagram.
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:09.800]  So I'm gonna find me on it.
[02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:11.560]  I don't tweet.
[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:13.760]  Just liking on social medias, bro.
[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:14.680]  I was excited.
[02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:15.520]  I thought I was gonna hear a whole slew of words.
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:17.480]  I'm a master, don't really use that.
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:18.480]  It's there.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:19.760]  It's BoBoBlasterCo, too.
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:20.600]  You can find me there, too.
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:22.280]  I want some of your furniture.
[02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:23.120]  Tell me about that.
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:24.280]  Oh, yeah, so the furniture.
[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:25.120]  The furniture is,
[02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:27.920]  I have a whole bunch of sweet little furniture ideas.
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:28.760]  Oh, not ideas.
[02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:29.920]  I have a whole bunch of products
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:34.920]  that are available on furniture.bigcartel.com.
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:39.280]  And basically I make coffee tables and tables.
[02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:43.800]  I have shelves that with basically e-mails built into it.
[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:47.880]  So you don't have to have a clumsy little pod or cluster.
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:49.440]  We're gonna work on a deal, F-E-S,
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:50.680]  because I need one.
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:51.600]  Yes, yes.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:57.030]  That's why he's not all over social buildings.
[02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:58.710]  Building furniture.
[02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:59.550]  Yeah.
[02:53:59.550 --> 02:54:01.150]  How long ago did you give me my table?
[02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:02.310]  That was over a year ago now.
[02:54:02.310 --> 02:54:03.150]  Over a year ago.
[02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.990]  That's what we were just talking about the other day
[02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:05.030]  on another podcast.
[02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:07.150]  And it still works, no problem.
[02:54:07.150 --> 02:54:07.990]  It's still jamming.
[02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:09.390]  That was like an original, original one, too.
[02:54:09.390 --> 02:54:10.230]  The paint's kinda beat up,
[02:54:10.230 --> 02:54:11.990]  but I mean, you know, that means it's been used.
[02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.830]  100%.
[02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:14.190]  It's not just a decoration.
[02:54:14.190 --> 02:54:15.710]  Yeah, that was what we were saying.
[02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:16.990]  That's why I'm happy I sent it to him,
[02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:19.430]  because that's what I sent it over to him for,
[02:54:19.430 --> 02:54:21.710]  was to really get that work into it.
[02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:23.390]  That was one of my first original ones.
[02:54:23.390 --> 02:54:24.230]  And I was like, you know what?
[02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:25.910]  Nice, I got the OG furniture table.
[02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:27.470]  How many people do I know and I've seen
[02:54:27.470 --> 02:54:30.990]  who like really just dabs and Ross and Jeff's that guy?
[02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:31.910]  I take some dabs.
[02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:32.750]  Well, thank you, bro.
[02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:33.590]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:34.430]  It's a great sample.
[02:54:34.430 --> 02:54:35.270]  It's a great product.
[02:54:35.270 --> 02:54:36.110]  I fully endorse furniture tables.
[02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.950]  Sweet, thank you.

[02:54:57.350 --> 02:54:58.670]  I have kids that come to me and they're just like,
[02:54:58.670 --> 02:55:00.310]  hey, put this in a shoe.
[02:55:00.310 --> 02:55:01.670]  I'm like, yeah, I'd probably put it in a shoe.
[02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:03.030]  Just give me a pair of shoes
[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:04.870]  and I could probably put it in a shoe.
[02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:07.390]  If you have something, we can work it out.
[02:55:07.390 --> 02:55:08.710]  We could just put it in your stash.
[02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:09.550]  Yeah, just have it emailed.
[02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:12.390]  Like a portable, really on the go email.
[02:55:12.390 --> 02:55:13.270]  On the go, yeah.
[02:55:13.270 --> 02:55:14.790]  Just coming out of the dashboard.
[02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:15.870]  I know that's highly illegal.
[02:55:15.870 --> 02:55:16.990]  I should not talk like that.
[02:55:16.990 --> 02:55:18.350]  We were making a joke.
[02:55:18.350 --> 02:55:19.750]  For camping, for camping.
[02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:22.630]  Or the outdoor experience, yes.
[02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:24.150]  When you're stuck in fucking traffic
[02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:25.990]  between Denver and Springs for an hour and a half
[02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:28.190]  and you move 10 feet because there's a wreck up there
[02:55:28.190 --> 02:55:29.750]  and nobody cares if you're taking a dab or not
[02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:31.270]  because you're not gonna drive for an hour anyway.
[02:55:31.270 --> 02:55:32.670]  Why can't I take a dab, officer?
[02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:35.030]  I just want, I just, ah!
[02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:37.150]  I'm having a panic attack.
[02:55:37.150 --> 02:55:39.150]  I just, yeah, you just definitely gave white Mike
[02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:41.110]  a panic attack while he's listening to this.
[02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.950]  Sorry, Mike.
[02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:44.190]  That was so unfair of him.
[02:55:44.190 --> 02:55:46.030]  Mike is like, oh my God, he's talking about,
[02:55:46.030 --> 02:55:49.830]  oh my, oh my, oh my, I need to take a dab.
[02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:53.030]  Sometimes the traffic is horrendous, Mike, I'm sorry.
[02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:54.470]  All right, Bubba, thanks for making
[02:55:54.470 --> 02:55:55.310]  the killer furniture tables.
[02:55:55.310 --> 02:55:56.150]  No, thank you, thank you.
[02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.990]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:58.470]  Thank you always for the love.
[02:55:58.470 --> 02:56:00.270]  Thank you always for letting me on here.
[02:56:00.270 --> 02:56:01.550]  It was so great coming out here.
[02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:03.150]  I love meeting all you guys.
[02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:04.750]  Sam, it was awesome meeting you.
[02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:08.030]  And Dan, Granny, it was wonderful meeting you.
[02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:09.470]  This is such a great, awesome,
[02:56:09.470 --> 02:56:10.830]  it's great to be in Canyon Canyon
[02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:12.270]  and have Canyon Canyon and stuff like this,
[02:56:12.270 --> 02:56:14.830]  to be able to have and be able to meet
[02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:17.030]  so many people at once, it's great.
[02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:18.310]  But Canyon's a great place.
[02:56:18.310 --> 02:56:19.150]  I really appreciate that place.
[02:56:19.150 --> 02:56:22.750]  You guys in states that are passing legalization
[02:56:23.470 --> 02:56:25.190]  for medical, please keep in mind,
[02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:26.990]  do not go strictly rec.
[02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:33.480]  I mean, there's people that really, truly need medical.
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:38.480]  Remember, you need places to gather and consume.
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:41.200]  You have people that have leases
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:44.240]  that they can't medicate in their own apartment.
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:45.360]  Where are they gonna go?
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:47.800]  You need places like this.
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.820]  We have learned here in Colorado,
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:53.060]  we're trying to help you.
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:55.180]  We're not being arrogant.
[02:56:55.220 --> 02:56:57.660]  Just put some forethought in a couple of things.
[02:56:57.660 --> 02:56:58.700]  Granny's completely right.
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:01.420]  In Colorado, we messed up when we wrote the bills here.
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:03.660]  We did not include consumption areas.
[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:05.300]  So there's a gray area.
[02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:07.060]  These places can be shut down at any time.
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:09.020]  This Canyon Canyon where we are allowed
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:10.860]  to sit here at this table and gather peacefully
[02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:13.340]  and take some dabs and have a podcast together,
[02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:15.740]  this could be stopped at any moment with just a letter.
[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:17.620]  All that would have to be done is a letter written
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:20.260]  and a judge says, no more, and it could be over.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:22.460]  So when you do get around to writing
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:24.420]  the legalization bills in your state,
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:26.820]  make sure you include these types of places.
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:29.140]  Make sure you put so many of these places available
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:31.820]  in so much locality and write rules for them
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:33.620]  because if you don't write rules,
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:35.620]  when it comes to make rules for cannabis legalization
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:37.780]  in your area, the rules will be written for you.
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:40.620]  And when they make the rules for you, you get really fucked.
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:42.540]  They say, okay, nothing then.
[02:57:42.540 --> 02:57:44.300]  If you let them write the rules, they don't give a shit.
[02:57:44.300 --> 02:57:45.900]  If you make the rules yourself,
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:47.260]  you can have experienced people on there
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:50.020]  that understand what this community wants and needs
[02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:51.100]  and it can be done appropriately.
[02:57:51.100 --> 02:57:53.260]  So I encourage you, be a part of that.
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.460]  Make sure you get the social clubs and the legislation
[02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:57.300]  when the time comes and the time is now,
[02:57:57.300 --> 02:57:58.820]  start doing it, get your shit together.
[02:57:58.820 --> 02:58:01.060]  Remember people, knowledge is power.
[02:58:02.260 --> 02:58:05.020]  We gotta keep this cannabis army on the march.
[02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:07.100]  Yes, just because we're getting recreation illegal
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:10.100]  in some places doesn't mean we can get lazy with it.
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:11.020]  Chris, thank you, bro.
[02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:11.900]  No, thank you.
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:14.460]  The beautiful Lindsey, Chris's better half.
[02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:16.700]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:18.540]  The lovely red dreads.
[02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:19.380]  Oh yeah.
[02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:21.020]  Looks like you cleaned up a little bit today, I like it.
[02:58:21.020 --> 02:58:22.700]  You gonna give a little buzz on the other sides?
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:24.980]  I had to get a haircut, it was getting bad.
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:27.220]  Take the little frillies off?
[02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:29.540]  I actually like it better short like this.
[02:58:29.540 --> 02:58:30.380]  You get a little airflow?
[02:58:30.380 --> 02:58:31.620]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:33.620]  Like you lollipopped your head a little?
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:38.000]  Lindsey, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:38.840]  Thank you for having me.
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:41.360]  I'm sure most of our listeners know how to find you by now,
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:45.360]  but remind everybody all of your social media connections.
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:48.240]  So my Instagram is the traveling stoner,
[02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:51.800]  my Snapchat is traveling stoner without the G,
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:54.000]  my Twitter is the travel stoner
[02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:56.680]  and my Periscope is the traveling stoner.
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:58.800]  You are one traveling stoner.
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:58:59.640]  That's me.
[02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:00.480]  I like it.
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:01.600]  Do you have any brands you need to shout out
[02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:02.920]  or anybody that is sponsoring you
[02:59:02.920 --> 02:59:05.520]  that you need to support while you're on here?
[02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:08.120]  Another shout out to Starfire Edibles for sure.
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:09.280]  Nom nom nom nom nom.
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:12.800]  Yeah, I mean, Jazz is just the bomb.
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:15.560]  I can't speak highly enough of her.
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.560]  And Dank Essence, CBD infused bath bombs as well.
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:22.920]  Bath bombs.
[02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:23.760]  Yeah.
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:25.880]  Is there a reason for a dude to use a bath bomb?
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:28.200]  You might like them actually.
[02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:29.040]  Yeah, so.
[02:59:29.040 --> 02:59:32.280]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hook me up.
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:33.520]  I had a product test them.
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:35.160]  So don't judge a guy.
[02:59:35.160 --> 02:59:37.720]  Did you make one of the videos like all the girls do?
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:38.560]  You got one, bro?
[02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.240]  Just turn to the camera, I'll cue you.
[02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:42.840]  I had a product test something that we made at our company.
[02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:44.400]  Oh, I thought you meant a Dank Essence one.
[02:59:44.400 --> 02:59:49.400]  Dank Essence, I actually, I gave some to my girlfriend.
[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:50.680]  Dank Essence?
[02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:56.250]  Not Dank Essence, another bath bomb.
[02:59:56.290 --> 02:59:59.370]  I think actually I've tried many of them.
[02:59:59.370 --> 03:00:03.370]  I do like Dank Essence because they are high in CBDs.
[03:00:03.370 --> 03:00:04.850]  And to me, okay,
[03:00:11.030 --> 03:00:14.590]  old school, I used to just soak with some Epsom salt.
[03:00:14.590 --> 03:00:18.550]  Now I use these bath bombs and they work.
[03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:21.430]  Colorado Springs, young men of Colorado Springs,
[03:00:21.430 --> 03:00:23.030]  you dab dudes, you're sitting on the couch
[03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:24.430]  on a fucking Saturday taking dabs,
[03:00:24.430 --> 03:00:26.550]  watching dabbing granny do videos.
[03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:28.670]  Go do our yard work, go mow her lawn for her,
[03:00:28.670 --> 03:00:31.030]  go pick up the trash, go pick up the leaves.
[03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:32.750]  Just hit her up on Instagram, say dabbing granny,
[03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:33.870]  I'm gonna come clean your front lawn
[03:00:33.870 --> 03:00:34.910]  because Ross and Jeff said so
[03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:36.350]  and I'm a respectful young man.
[03:00:36.350 --> 03:00:39.710]  There's no need for you to be out there cleaning up.
[03:00:39.710 --> 03:00:41.950]  You're too awesome to be out there cleaning shit up.
[03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:43.830]  Some young man, you ain't doing shit, dude.
[03:00:43.830 --> 03:00:46.270]  Get up off the couch, go help out the dabbing granny.
[03:00:46.270 --> 03:00:48.310]  And then after that, go help out someone else's granny
[03:00:48.310 --> 03:00:49.990]  and clean up some fucking leaves, clean up their yard.
[03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.830]  Help somebody out.
[03:00:50.830 --> 03:01:02.910]  Do you know I always end my YouTube somebody
[03:01:02.910 --> 03:01:06.070]  because you'll feel good at the end of the day.
[03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:09.110]  I see no reason to not end this podcast on that.
[03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.950]  Not at all.
[03:01:09.950 --> 03:01:12.790]  Someone else is kind of like, fuck.
[03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:16.110]  Oh man, Kabuki J Fox just called in on FaceTime.
[03:01:16.110 --> 03:01:17.270]  Somebody put your mic up to him.
[03:01:17.270 --> 03:01:18.110]  I can't hear him from here.
[03:01:18.110 --> 03:01:28.890]  You know I wanna meet you.
[03:01:28.890 --> 03:01:31.090]  All right, right?
[03:01:31.970 --> 03:01:34.010]  So Kabuki J Fox just happens to call right
[03:01:34.010 --> 03:01:35.730]  as we're recording, that's so awesome.
[03:01:35.730 --> 03:01:37.330]  Kabuki, you gave me a gift the other day
[03:01:37.330 --> 03:01:39.730]  and I appreciate it, thank you brother.
[03:01:39.730 --> 03:01:41.970]  He threw me a peace sign and said I'm welcome at any time.
[03:01:41.970 --> 03:01:42.810]  So that's awesome.
[03:01:42.810 --> 03:01:43.650]  That's great that you called us.
[03:01:44.090 --> 03:01:48.250]  Kabuki J Fox and his CBD medicine.
[03:01:48.250 --> 03:01:51.450]  Great with the CBDs I always talk about.
[03:01:51.450 --> 03:01:56.450]  I see his Instagram pictures and I salivate.
[03:01:56.930 --> 03:01:58.370]  Guys, I love each and every one of you.
[03:01:58.370 --> 03:02:00.050]  Thanks for joining me on the podcast.
[03:02:00.050 --> 03:02:00.890]  This is fucking awesome.
[03:02:00.890 --> 03:02:01.730]  Look forward to coming back.
[03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:02.570]  Thank you.
[03:02:02.570 --> 03:02:03.410]  Big shout out to the Canna Canyon.
[03:02:03.410 --> 03:02:04.250]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:04.250 --> 03:02:05.090]  Oh, you're welcome, man.
[03:02:05.090 --> 03:02:05.930]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[03:02:05.930 --> 03:02:06.810]  I was glad to find out you're coming.
[03:02:06.810 --> 03:02:07.690]  I heard you're coming.
[03:02:07.690 --> 03:02:08.530]  Somebody told me you're coming.
[03:02:08.530 --> 03:02:09.370]  I was like, that's gonna be rad,
[03:02:09.370 --> 03:02:10.210]  because Sam's cool.
[03:02:10.210 --> 03:02:12.130]  I've heard a lot of cool shit about you already.
[03:02:12.130 --> 03:02:13.330]  Thank you very much, it was a great time.
[03:02:13.330 --> 03:02:14.210]  Anytime, man, anytime.
[03:02:14.210 --> 03:02:16.370]  If you guys ever wanna do a podcast to any of you,
[03:02:16.370 --> 03:02:17.410]  if you're bored, you wanna hang out,
[03:02:17.410 --> 03:02:18.330]  say, let's podcast.
[03:02:18.330 --> 03:02:19.850]  I'll put this gear together and we'll do this.
[03:02:19.850 --> 03:02:20.690]  This is rad.

[03:02:45.010 --> 03:02:47.450]  We're on Colorado Avenue, I think.
[03:02:47.450 --> 03:02:50.130]  I don't wanna give you the wrong address.
[03:02:50.130 --> 03:02:51.410]  I was gonna say 1503.

[03:03:08.330 --> 03:03:10.170]  So go in the alley, park in the back.
[03:03:10.170 --> 03:03:11.010]  It's a great place.
[03:03:11.730 --> 03:03:12.570]  You cannot walk in through the back.
[03:03:12.570 --> 03:03:13.410]  You have to come through the front door.
[03:03:13.410 --> 03:03:14.930]  If you're 21 and over, we invite you.
[03:03:14.930 --> 03:03:15.970]  If you're not a dick,

[03:03:17.130 --> 03:03:18.130]  you wanna come smoke some hash,
[03:03:18.130 --> 03:03:19.490]  you wanna come be a cool person and hang out,

[03:03:22.170 --> 03:03:23.570]  Everybody is getting distracted
[03:03:23.570 --> 03:03:25.490]  because the hash is spinning around the table.
[03:03:25.490 --> 03:03:27.170]  Everyone's getting excited.
[03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:28.130]  Thank you all for listening.
