[00:01.530 --> 00:06.250]  Hey everybody, Rasta Jeff here. Before I start the podcast, I want to send love and respect
[00:06.250 --> 00:10.010]  to all of the victims of the Planned Parenthood shooting. And I also want to send a huge thank
[00:10.010 --> 00:14.490]  you to all of the law enforcement that helped rescue those people. Thank you.
[00:14.490 --> 00:33.760]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 108 of the Grow From
[00:33.760 --> 00:39.320]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education and conversation. That's right.
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.680]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.040]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.560]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My
[00:51.560 --> 00:55.160]  friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys for joining me as always. I need
[00:55.160 --> 00:58.240]  to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.440]  music on my show. Big thanks to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Also you
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.320]  guys, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Hitman Glass. Hitman Glass,
[01:09.320 --> 01:13.280]  made in America by Americans. When I'm shopping for a new rig, I like to know that what I'm
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.400]  paying for is going to give me a nice fat dab. And you know what? I can always rely
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.280]  on Hitman Glass. Don't trust your dab to a rig made in China by a Chinese child without
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.640]  proper eye protection or adequate pay. Buy yourself some glass made in America by folks
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.760]  who dab as hard as you. Hitman Glass is not only a glass company, you guys. Hitman Dougie

[01:44.360 --> 01:48.960]  You guys, tonight as we record, I'm hitting my Hitman E-Series sidecar. This is my first
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.440]  Hitman rig and I have been impressed since my first rip out of any Hitman rig. Shout
[01:53.440 --> 01:56.880]  out to Hitman Glass and Dougie. You know, I can remember the first time I hit a Hitman
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.800]  rig. I hit a Hitman sidecar with my homie Hank. We may have been in his car. I don't
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.000]  know nothing about that. But a big shout out to my buddy Hank for introducing me to the
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.500]  world of Hitman Glass. I have not looked back since then. You guys, I know everybody
[02:11.500 --> 02:15.960]  likes a nice custom rig, a nice colorful rig made by some fancy artist. It's always great
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.120]  to have in your collection, but sometimes you pay a bunch of money and you go to hit
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.360]  that rig and when you put water in it, the first time you go to draw through it, you
[02:23.360 --> 02:26.600]  get water in your mouth. Every time you try to take a dab, you get water in your mouth
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.560]  because the water level has to be just at this awkward level to where when you hit it,
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.280]  you get water in your mouth or you can put a little less water and not get any bubbles.
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.760]  That never happens with a Hitman rig. When you buy a Hitman rig, it is always going to
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.280]  hit like a fucking truck. So I recommend Hitman Glass. Let's quit rambling about glass and
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.840]  let's take a dab, you guys. Today we're going to hit the Hitman E-Series sidecar. I've got
[02:46.840 --> 02:50.040]  a highly educated domeless nail. I'm going to heat this sucker up. We're going to do
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.720]  it old school. I'm going to use a torch and not use the e-nail today. I'm sitting in a
[02:54.720 --> 02:57.840]  different location, so I don't have the e-nail right here, but I'm heating this nail up,
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.160]  getting it nice and hot and we're going to take a dab together and then we're going to
[03:00.160 --> 03:05.200]  get on with this podcast. So you guys, I hope you've got a dab ready. I hope wherever you are,
[03:05.200 --> 03:08.760]  whatever you're doing, you're smoking something tasty. Let's take a dab together. This dab,
[03:08.760 --> 03:22.260]  you guys, goes out to Hitman Glass and the entire Hitman crew. Let's take a dab. Here we go. Yeah.
[03:22.260 --> 03:29.380]  That was my first rig and I love the way it hits. My first Hitman rig and I love the way it hits.
[03:29.380 --> 03:33.620]  Shout out to the Hitman crew. I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping. You guys,
[03:33.620 --> 03:36.420]  I've got a whole bunch of stuff that I want to talk about in this podcast. So let's get
[03:36.420 --> 03:43.860]  down to business a little bit. I need to mention that my Instagram account, the IRI Genetics
[03:43.860 --> 03:49.100]  Instagram account was at 19,000 followers and Instagram shut that thing down. So big middle
[03:49.100 --> 03:53.860]  finger to Instagram for that. What I would like you to do is follow my new account. It's IRI
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.020]  underscore genetics. So I've got a new account going. I've been posting a few pictures. I've
[03:59.020 --> 04:05.020]  got close to a thousand followers again. Excuse my cough. So please go support the new IRI
[04:05.140 --> 04:09.780]  Genetics Instagram page. It looks like they're out to get the entire cannabis community. What
[04:09.780 --> 04:15.180]  I read today was as long as you don't post pictures of yourself using cannabis, you can
[04:15.180 --> 04:19.660]  post pictures of your plants and of your rigs and of your hash and of your buds. You just can't post
[04:19.660 --> 04:24.620]  pictures of yourself smoking is what somebody tried to tell me today. Excuse my coughing. I
[04:24.620 --> 04:28.020]  did just take a fat dab. And you know what? It seems true because the accounts that are getting
[04:28.020 --> 04:32.020]  deleted are people smoking and the accounts, the accounts that are still there, they don't have
[04:32.140 --> 04:36.180]  images of them smoking. So I'm going to try to stick with that. I'll just be posting pictures of
[04:36.180 --> 04:41.860]  plants, pictures of me at work, pictures of stuff like that. But I won't be posting dab videos and
[04:41.860 --> 04:47.780]  dab pictures to Instagram anymore. I apologize. So yeah, make sure you follow the new IRI
[04:47.780 --> 04:53.860]  Genetics Instagram. Also, I want to send a huge shout out to my friend, Seb. I'm not sure if you
[04:53.860 --> 04:57.980]  want me to say your whole name on the podcast. But big shout out to my friend Seb from Australia.
[04:58.180 --> 05:01.540]  You guys have been talking about the donation button on the podcast page. If you go to the
[05:01.540 --> 05:07.460]  website, IRI Genetics, colorado.com, go to the podcast tab, there is a PayPal button on the top
[05:07.460 --> 05:11.940]  right. That is a donation button. And every donation you make goes directly to my PayPal
[05:11.940 --> 05:17.860]  account. You guys are friend, Seb from Australia sent me a nice donation. And I really want to
[05:17.860 --> 05:22.100]  give you a huge thank you shout out, dude. Thank you. That was amazing. That's a huge
[05:22.100 --> 05:27.060]  contribution. I absolutely appreciate it. It did not go unnoticed. Thanks a lot. If you guys want
[05:27.060 --> 05:30.260]  to make a contribution, I would definitely appreciate it. I'll give you a big old shout out
[05:30.260 --> 05:35.780]  on the show. I will be your Facebook friend. I would love it. All right. So big shout out to our buddy
[05:35.780 --> 05:40.660]  Seb. That is super awesome of you. I super appreciate the contribution. Let's see. One more
[05:40.660 --> 05:46.180]  thing to mention. Episode number 106, you guys. I put up episode number 106 a couple of weeks ago
[05:46.180 --> 05:51.220]  and Stitcher failed to grab the episode. It would not play on Stitcher. But since then, it has been
[05:51.220 --> 05:55.860]  fixed. So if you are a Stitcher listener, you can go back and listen to episode number 106.
[05:55.860 --> 05:59.940]  It's kind of an important episode. If you're, if you hang out with me, if you listen to me,
[05:59.940 --> 06:04.180]  and you feel like we're buddies, since we become podcast friends, episode number 106 is kind of
[06:04.180 --> 06:07.700]  important. It tells you a little bit about what's going on in my world. I think you should listen
[06:07.700 --> 06:12.660]  if you have not. So that is available on Stitcher now. Let's see. There's a whole bunch of stuff I
[06:12.660 --> 06:18.660]  want to cover you guys. Dude. So everybody knows I quit the spot dispensary. And if you don't,
[06:18.660 --> 06:22.500]  when you listen to episode number 106, you will learn that because that's part of what 106 is
[06:22.500 --> 06:27.540]  about. I no longer work at the spot dispensary. I am now part of the green and healthy wellness
[06:27.540 --> 06:32.260]  team. I am the lead cultivator for the green and healthy wellness gardens in Colorado Springs.
[06:32.260 --> 06:37.380]  Big shout out to my boy hunt. He's got trust and faith in me and understands that I am able to run
[06:37.380 --> 06:41.700]  this large garden by myself and produce the quality of cannabis that they expect on their
[06:41.700 --> 06:46.580]  shelves. So much respect to the green and healthy team, much respect to hunt. But let me get back to
[06:46.580 --> 06:50.900]  what I was saying. I quit the spot recently. I just wasn't working for me nothing personal against
[06:50.900 --> 06:55.860]  the spot. It just wasn't they don't have any plants yet. And I'm a pot grower. So I needed to
[06:55.860 --> 07:02.420]  be growing and that wasn't happening. So I quit. But the spot held a contest or maybe a raffle. It
[07:02.420 --> 07:08.420]  wasn't really a contest. What they did was anybody who spent over $50 in purchases got their name
[07:08.420 --> 07:13.780]  entered into a raffle to win two tickets to the Grateful Dead concert at the first bank center
[07:13.780 --> 07:17.860]  just a couple of nights ago. It wasn't actually the Grateful Dead. They called themselves dead
[07:17.860 --> 07:21.860]  and co. It's most of the members of the Grateful Dead but the bass player and the lead guitar player
[07:21.860 --> 07:28.420]  and the keyboard player are new guys because well the guitar player is dead you guys the lead Jerry
[07:28.420 --> 07:32.500]  Garcia has been dead for several years. So they had John Mayer of all people replace him. They
[07:32.500 --> 07:37.060]  had Oteel Burbridge replace the bass player because Phil Lesh is out with bladder cancer.
[07:37.060 --> 07:40.580]  And if you know anything about the Grateful Dead you know that they just have an issue with keyboard
[07:40.580 --> 07:45.220]  players. Their keyboard players seem to die for some reason. So this time they had Jeff Cimenti
[07:45.220 --> 07:52.740]  on keyboards. But so the spot had this raffle to anybody that spent 50 bucks could win these
[07:52.740 --> 07:57.300]  tickets by being entered into a raffle. Our good friend Sloppy who has been here on the podcast
[07:57.300 --> 08:03.140]  actually won the Grateful Dead tickets. Sloppy didn't put down his phone number or anything. He
[08:03.140 --> 08:08.100]  simply wrote Sloppy on the on the raffle ticket. So our good friend Mike is the manager over at the
[08:08.100 --> 08:11.700]  spot dispenser. He might call me and he said hey bro Sloppy won these Grateful Dead tickets. How do
[08:11.700 --> 08:15.620]  I get a hold of him. And I texted Sloppy and I said hey bro you won these Grateful Dead tickets.
[08:15.620 --> 08:23.700]  And Sloppy said cool take those tickets and have fun bro. So Sloppy the man my homie Sloppy what's
[08:23.700 --> 08:29.700]  up brother I love you bro. Sloppy threw me two free Grateful Dead tickets. So I got to go see
[08:29.700 --> 08:34.660]  the Grateful Dead on what was it was a Tuesday. Yeah I get to go see this version of the Grateful
[08:34.660 --> 08:40.340]  Dead on Tuesday. And I think it's great because I quit the spot a week ago and I'm still getting
[08:40.340 --> 08:44.020]  perks and hookups from the spot. So shout out to the spot for the free Grateful Dead tickets. I had
[08:44.020 --> 08:47.940]  a great time and also a super huge shout out to my boy Sloppy. When I told him I had Grateful Dead
[08:47.940 --> 08:51.940]  tickets he didn't even hesitate. He was like those are yours go have fun. So big shout out to Sloppy.
[08:51.940 --> 08:57.620]  I love you bro. Shout out to Dave. I was good bumping into you over at the Grateful Dead show.
[08:57.620 --> 09:01.380]  That was kind of a fun experience and also a big shout out to Rachel. It was good seeing you there.
[09:01.380 --> 09:06.020]  It's fun watching you blow big old vape clouds through the whole show. But yeah I got to go see
[09:06.020 --> 09:10.260]  the Grateful Dead and I think it's kind of neat that the job I quit a week ago kind of in a round
[09:10.260 --> 09:14.100]  about way gave me free tickets to go see the Grateful Dead. That was ironic in my mind.
[09:14.900 --> 09:20.980]  But the Grateful Dead holy crap that was such a good show. They're at a whole new level of
[09:20.980 --> 09:25.460]  playing. The music is refreshed. I said it a minute ago and you guys probably scratched your
[09:25.460 --> 09:30.660]  head and said what John Mayer plays for the Grateful Dead now? Yes that happened. A few years
[09:30.660 --> 09:35.060]  ago John Mayer did something stupid and I don't pay a lot of attention but he said something stupid
[09:35.060 --> 09:39.620]  somewhere and it messed up his musical career and people did not like him. So he kind of took a
[09:39.620 --> 09:45.140]  little hiatus and went away for a while and while he was finding himself he discovered the Grateful
[09:45.140 --> 09:48.900]  Dead and discovered the Grateful Dead music and the way of the dead and the community and really
[09:48.900 --> 09:54.340]  got into it and somehow ended up playing guitar for the Grateful Dead now. And you know what?
[09:54.340 --> 10:01.140]  At first I was skeptical because John Mayer is not my style of music at all. That's like
[10:01.140 --> 10:05.620]  girl music. It's like teenager music in my mind. And yeah I know I'm a prick because I'm really
[10:05.620 --> 10:11.380]  judgmental about music but I gotta say when I saw John Mayer playing with the Grateful Dead
[10:11.380 --> 10:17.380]  he nails it. He gets it perfect. He does everything exactly the way it should be done. His tone is
[10:17.380 --> 10:23.060]  perfect. He does not overplay. The dude knows how to play a guitar. He can sing you guys. He sang a
[10:23.060 --> 10:28.820]  few tunes and they sounded perfect. I loved it. Great show. So if you guys get a chance to go see
[10:28.820 --> 10:33.060]  any Grateful Dead shows, if you're a Grateful Dead fan, I definitely recommend you go check it out.
[10:33.860 --> 10:38.580]  Get there early. Have a good time. Enjoy the lot scene. Big shout out to my buddy Gibbs. I took
[10:38.580 --> 10:42.020]  Gibbs with me to the Grateful Dead show and we had a great time. Haven't seen Gibbs in quite a while
[10:42.020 --> 10:46.500]  so it was a wonderful time hanging out with my brother Gibbs at the Grateful Dead show. Shout
[10:46.500 --> 10:50.180]  out to the entire Deadhead family. I'm gonna keep moving on with the podcast. I feel like I'm really
[10:50.180 --> 10:56.260]  rambly today so I hope you guys are into that. I've got an event coming up on next weekend. It's
[10:56.260 --> 11:02.580]  the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational. Everybody knows that I bred this strain of weed for the lovely
[11:03.220 --> 11:06.100]  Miss Dude It's Damsel. If you guys aren't following Dude It's Damsel on Instagram,
[11:06.100 --> 11:10.020]  you're missing out. Make sure you go follow my friend Dude It's Damsel. She's the manager at
[11:10.020 --> 11:14.580]  Green and Healthy Wellness. She's an alternative model and her Instagram pictures will put a smile
[11:14.580 --> 11:19.860]  on your face. But I did breed a strain of cannabis for our friend Damsel and we are having an
[11:19.860 --> 11:25.540]  official tasting party at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational on the 4th and 5th of next month.
[11:25.540 --> 11:31.300]  So I will record. I will do my best to record with Damsel and get a little bit of that onto
[11:31.300 --> 11:35.620]  the show. But what we're gonna do is Damsel's bringing a few of her friends from out of town.
[11:36.340 --> 11:40.820]  Hunt, myself, and a couple other dudes will be at the event. We've rented a house in Manitou
[11:40.820 --> 11:45.460]  Springs. It's a private party. We've rented a house and we're going to have a tasting party.
[11:46.020 --> 11:49.620]  I've got 10 jars in front of me. I'm gonna crack one open right now just for fun.
[11:49.620 --> 11:55.540]  I got 10 jars of herb that I grew for the lovely Damsel. It smells so good. And we're gonna have
[11:55.540 --> 12:00.420]  a little tasting party and Miss Damsel is going to decide which of these phenotypes
[12:00.420 --> 12:07.300]  gets to be the selection that will take the name of Damsel's Dank. And then we will get a clone into
[12:07.300 --> 12:13.060]  the shop and we will start growing Damsel's Dank at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[12:13.060 --> 12:17.620]  And it will be available on the shelves. It'll be a little while, but we'll get it there and the
[12:17.620 --> 12:22.100]  whole world with a medical card will be able to try it. Hopefully, eventually Colorado Springs
[12:22.100 --> 12:26.100]  will wake up and start allowing recreational cannabis sales. And that way we can make
[12:26.100 --> 12:31.380]  Damsel's Dank available to the entire world. That would be awesome. Big shout out to Hunt for
[12:31.380 --> 12:36.100]  putting me in touch with Damsel and also a huge shout out to the lovely dude at Damsel.
[12:36.740 --> 12:42.020]  Hey Britt, thanks for giving me the honor of being the breeder chosen to create a strain for you. I
[12:42.020 --> 12:46.820]  understand how important this is to you and I'm gonna get it right for you. Trust me. All right,
[12:46.820 --> 12:51.140]  so the next thing I want to do is a little grow lesson. This will be a very simple lesson.
[12:52.100 --> 12:57.140]  I was watching a Facebook argument the other day and people were arguing over a plant being
[12:57.140 --> 13:02.260]  male or female. And I thought I'd just come on here and just make it really clear and simple.
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.740]  And we'll talk about what a male and a female plant look like. Okay, when it comes time to
[13:06.740 --> 13:11.780]  determine the sex of your plants, there are a few ways you can go about doing it. The main way that
[13:11.780 --> 13:17.300]  you can do it is to just flower your plant. If you've got a plant and you put it under 12-12,
[13:17.300 --> 13:22.500]  which is 12 hours on and 12 hours off of light, and you need full darkness in your dark cycle,
[13:22.500 --> 13:27.460]  you guys, you need complete darkness uninterrupted for 12 full hours. If you can see anything in
[13:27.460 --> 13:32.740]  that room in the dark cycle, it is too bright, you need to make it darker. There's if there's
[13:32.740 --> 13:36.660]  any light, it's not dark enough, that is not considered dark. If you can see your hand in
[13:36.660 --> 13:41.780]  front of your face, it is too light in there. The only lights that you can have in a grow room during
[13:41.780 --> 13:47.300]  the dark cycle are green LED lights, or those green coiled fluorescent lights. Those will work
[13:47.300 --> 13:51.940]  for you. You need green light in your dark cycle. Green lighting during the flowering cycle does not
[13:51.940 --> 13:56.820]  interrupt the flowering photo period, because the plants are green and they do not absorb green light.
[13:56.820 --> 14:02.660]  So by putting any plant into the 12-12 period, you will actually induce the flowering stage.
[14:03.300 --> 14:08.980]  And in about 10 to 14 days-ish, you'll be able to tell if your plant is male or female
[14:09.620 --> 14:13.220]  by signs that it shows. And we'll talk about those here in just a couple of seconds.
[14:13.220 --> 14:17.140]  And you guys, you can flower a plant at any size. It doesn't matter how big it is.
[14:17.780 --> 14:21.300]  What's going to happen is it's going to flower when you put it into 12-12. That's what's going
[14:21.300 --> 14:26.980]  to make it flower. But what I always recommend is that you take a clone from every seed that you
[14:26.980 --> 14:32.580]  grow. When you start a plant from seed, please take a clone from it. You never know, you might
[14:32.580 --> 14:37.140]  be growing the most amazing strain anybody has ever smoked. It may be the perfect medicinal
[14:37.140 --> 14:41.940]  strain for everybody on the planet, for the entire population. It could cure every ailment,
[14:41.940 --> 14:46.100]  you never know. And if you didn't take a clone, oh, you're going to be so mad at yourself about
[14:46.100 --> 14:51.220]  that. You guys, there's one strain that I grew that got away. I could not get it to clone,
[14:51.220 --> 14:54.740]  and it was some of the best cannabis I've ever smoked. And I'm a little mad at myself
[14:54.740 --> 14:58.500]  that I couldn't get it to clone, but I do have more seeds of it. So hopefully I can find that
[14:58.500 --> 15:03.540]  phenotype again. Anyway, when you grow, so grow a plant from seed, right? And then put it under
[15:03.540 --> 15:08.660]  12-12, and it will flower. I always recommend taking a clone. So take a clone. Now you've got
[15:08.660 --> 15:13.620]  a plant that has grown for a little while, and you've got a clone. You can either flower out that
[15:13.620 --> 15:17.540]  original plant that has been growing, and that way you've got a little bit of product to show for
[15:17.540 --> 15:22.900]  yourself, and you've got something to smoke and make it worth your time. Or you can flower out
[15:22.900 --> 15:27.620]  that clone. As soon as that clone that you took starts showing roots, you can switch that light
[15:27.620 --> 15:33.380]  to 12-12, and that clone will flower. And in 10 to 14 days, you'll have a little tiny plant with
[15:33.380 --> 15:38.020]  either male or female flowers coming out of it. And you'll be able to tell if you've got a boy or
[15:38.020 --> 15:42.740]  a girl. And at that point, you can either throw away that male plant that you've got that's in
[15:42.740 --> 15:48.500]  the bigger pot, or you can put that female plant into the flowering room and start making buds out
[15:48.500 --> 15:53.220]  of it, or keep it as a mother plant and keep taking clones off of it and have that strain around
[15:53.220 --> 15:58.500]  forever. So take clones, you guys, and then you can either clone that original clone or flower
[15:58.500 --> 16:02.820]  that original clone as it roots out, and then you can see what you've got, or you can flower that
[16:02.820 --> 16:07.860]  original plant. Either way, it's going to do the same thing, and you will know what you've got.
[16:07.860 --> 16:13.700]  Please take a clone. I can't stress that. So also, you guys, the plants will show sex if you let them
[16:13.700 --> 16:18.260]  pre-flower. If you leave a plant in a pot for long enough to where it feels like it's starting to get
[16:18.260 --> 16:23.780]  root-bound and it's reached its space, its space constraints in that pot, it will actually start
[16:23.780 --> 16:28.500]  to flower on its own. Some genetics will just panic and start to flower on their own that way,
[16:28.500 --> 16:32.820]  and they will show you what is called a pre-flower. That's just the plant showing you that it's
[16:32.820 --> 16:37.060]  reaching maturity, that it is ready to go, that its hormones are built up, that it wants you to
[16:37.060 --> 16:41.940]  switch the flowering cycle. So simply waiting for the plant to pre-flower is a good way to determine
[16:41.940 --> 16:46.580]  if you've got a male or a female, but then you do waste a lot of light and a lot of nutrients and a
[16:46.580 --> 16:50.500]  lot of space. And if you're a productive gardener, sometimes you just can't deal with that. That's why
[16:50.500 --> 16:54.340]  I recommend cutting a clone and flowering out that little clone and seeing what you've got.
[16:54.980 --> 16:59.700]  It's a lot easier to waste a little bit of time under a fluorescent light than it is to waste time
[16:59.700 --> 17:03.460]  under that big thousand-watt high-pressure sodium lamp where you could have been running a useful
[17:03.460 --> 17:08.580]  crop. So take some clones, flower them out, see what you're working with. And now it feels like
[17:08.580 --> 17:13.700]  it's time to talk about what to look for when your plants do start flowering so that you can tell if
[17:13.700 --> 17:19.700]  you've got boys or girls. Basically, I'm going to call it an intersection, but at a node where the
[17:19.700 --> 17:22.980]  two nodes separate, you've got your main stalk coming up, and then you've got the little intersection
[17:22.980 --> 17:28.100]  where a branch comes off to the left and a branch comes off to the right. Right about there, your
[17:28.100 --> 17:32.420]  plants are either going to grow balls or hairs. And I know that sounds really general, but that's
[17:32.420 --> 17:37.940]  the most simple way to describe this. You're either going to get a pair of balls growing out right
[17:37.940 --> 17:43.460]  there at that intersection, or you are going to get little hairs. If you see two little hairs
[17:43.460 --> 17:48.660]  sticking up, those are your female plant parts. Those are actually the parts that if you were to
[17:48.660 --> 17:53.380]  spread pollen in the room, the pollen would land on those little pistils. Those are called pistils,
[17:53.380 --> 17:57.700]  and those pistils would slide the pollen up into the ovule, which would absorb the pollen,
[17:57.700 --> 18:04.180]  which would then pollinate your plant, and then it would produce seeds. So if you've got those
[18:04.340 --> 18:09.060]  hairs, you have got girls. If you've got those balls, you've got male plants. And unless you
[18:09.060 --> 18:14.100]  plan on making some seeds and doing some breeding, it is time to get those boy plants out of the
[18:14.100 --> 18:17.620]  room. And honestly, if you're listening to this lesson and you're learning about how to determine
[18:17.620 --> 18:22.420]  sex, please do not breed cannabis yet. Please learn a lot more about plants before you breed,
[18:22.420 --> 18:26.900]  and I'll touch on that in a minute. I'll try to remember to mention why. So if you see balls,
[18:26.900 --> 18:31.380]  get those plants out of there. Also, here's a good hint. The male plants, I'm a breeder,
[18:31.380 --> 18:34.980]  I've been breeding plants for a long time. I've been growing plants for a really long time.
[18:34.980 --> 18:40.500]  One thing I really notice is the male plants grow much, much taller. If you've got a plant that's
[18:40.500 --> 18:45.540]  just taken off, it's just getting really, really tall. It's got a real thick, fibrous stock. That's
[18:45.540 --> 18:50.100]  probably a boy. I would just count on that. Don't get so excited that you've got this one plant that
[18:50.100 --> 18:54.500]  grows like a son of a bitch. It is probably a son of that bitch. It's probably a boy. You're
[18:54.500 --> 18:58.340]  going to want to get rid of that in the future. As soon as you flower it, you will know. Pull
[18:58.340 --> 19:03.620]  the males as soon as you can, you guys. If you've got male and female plants flowering next to each
[19:03.620 --> 19:10.020]  other, by day 14, that male plant is getting ready to drop pollen. I've seen them drop pollen
[19:10.580 --> 19:16.100]  around two weeks into flower. The second to third week, that male plant is really going to start
[19:16.100 --> 19:20.740]  spitting out his pollen. Your female plants are going to be just ready to take pollen at that
[19:20.740 --> 19:23.860]  time. So you're going to end up with a seeded crop if you don't pay attention and get those
[19:23.860 --> 19:29.220]  boys out of there. If you leave those boys in too long, they'll seed up the entire room very
[19:29.220 --> 19:34.980]  quickly. It just takes one quick little pass of the fan to spread that pollen through the whole room,
[19:34.980 --> 19:39.540]  and then you've got a pollinated crop. You've got seeds everywhere. So pay attention, check every
[19:39.540 --> 19:45.380]  single day, get the males out of there, be diligent about it, don't relax, stay on top of that shit,
[19:45.380 --> 19:49.460]  and get those out of there. All right. So it feels like I've talked enough about male plants and how
[19:49.460 --> 19:54.740]  to identify them. Let's talk a little bit about hermaphrodites, because hermaphrodites can really
[19:54.740 --> 20:01.460]  confuse a new grower. Hermaphrodites can confuse an experienced grower. A hermaphrodite is, and
[20:01.460 --> 20:05.380]  there are a lot of words for it, you'll hear people call it a hermie or a herm. It's a
[20:05.380 --> 20:11.460]  hermaphrodite, you guys. It is a plant that has both male and female sexes, and it will show them
[20:12.260 --> 20:17.300]  hopefully very early in flower. Unfortunately, sometimes you don't see it until like week eight
[20:17.300 --> 20:20.980]  on a nine week plant, and then it starts showing a little pollen sack, and then you're like, oh shit,
[20:20.980 --> 20:24.100]  I got to cut this plant, or I got to pick this pollen sack out. You start panicking.
[20:24.820 --> 20:31.380]  But let's talk about hermaphrodites. When you see a plant with male and female parts coming out of
[20:31.380 --> 20:37.620]  it during flower, you've probably got yourself a hermaphrodite. Oftentimes this happens in regular
[20:37.620 --> 20:42.500]  breeding, and it often happens in feminized seeds. This is something that just happens.
[20:43.060 --> 20:47.940]  I breed regular and feminized seeds. A lot of people try to hate on feminized seeds for
[20:47.940 --> 20:52.260]  hermaphrodism. If feminized seeds are made correctly, they will not be hermaphrodites,
[20:52.260 --> 20:59.700]  you guys. They will be good seeds. I've gotten more hermaphrodites from regular seeds than I have
[20:59.700 --> 21:05.620]  from feminized seeds, and I'm a breeder and I run a lot of seeds. So I don't blame it on the
[21:05.620 --> 21:10.500]  feminized seeds at all. I think it is just something that happens. You get males, you get
[21:10.500 --> 21:16.100]  females, and you get hermaphrodites. The whole goal of this plant, its whole goal is to reproduce
[21:16.100 --> 21:21.300]  itself. That's what it wants to do. It's a horny plant, it's a horny male, it's a horny girl. They
[21:21.300 --> 21:25.700]  just want to find another plant. They want to make seeds so that the seeds can drop into the ground,
[21:25.700 --> 21:30.580]  and those seeds can happen again next year. This whole plant's goal is to just reproduce.
[21:30.580 --> 21:35.540]  Sometimes it will do whatever it's got to reproduce, and one of its fail-safe backup
[21:35.540 --> 21:40.420]  plans is to become a hermaphrodite. So sometimes that happens. Now I've said that that can be a
[21:40.420 --> 21:45.780]  trait that is just in the plant. That can be in the DNA of that plant. It can be, that plant can
[21:45.780 --> 21:52.500]  be born as a hermaphrodite. But sometimes hermaphrodites are caused by environment or
[21:52.500 --> 21:59.300]  mistakes. If you interrupt the dark cycle during the flowering period, I talked earlier about how
[21:59.300 --> 22:04.500]  you have to have that complete 12-12 photo period with 12 hours of complete uninterrupted darkness.
[22:06.020 --> 22:11.620]  If you interrupt that, you will cause your plants to hermaphrodite. If you seriously, if you open up
[22:11.620 --> 22:17.380]  that door and left that light on for six hours during one dark cycle, you will start to see male
[22:17.380 --> 22:21.940]  flowers pop up in your female flowers. You'll see it happen, and you will have a seeded plant.
[22:23.300 --> 22:26.660]  It happens like that. That is the kind of thing that can cause hermaphrodism.
[22:27.860 --> 22:31.620]  A lot of the chemdog and cush strains, if you push them too hard with nutrients,
[22:31.620 --> 22:35.940]  or just give them a little bit of stress somehow, if they get bugs or powdery mildew,
[22:35.940 --> 22:40.580]  they'll hermaphrodite on you just in a survival method. That is something that that plant wants
[22:40.580 --> 22:45.860]  to do just to make sure that it gets to carry on with its race. It just wants to keep going on with
[22:45.860 --> 22:50.980]  its life. Hermaphrodites can be really confusing. Shit does happen like that in the grow room.
[22:50.980 --> 22:56.580]  That's your job as a grower to be aware of it and to learn how to identify it. If you see
[22:57.300 --> 23:02.340]  pollen sacks and pistils on the same plant, you've probably got a hermaphrodite. It is not worth
[23:02.340 --> 23:06.340]  keeping. You need to get rid of that plant. No matter how good it looks, no matter how sweet it
[23:06.340 --> 23:11.300]  smells, that plant needs to go. Now, if your plant is well into the flowering cycle and you've got
[23:11.300 --> 23:15.380]  big old chunky buds and you're starting to see these pollen sacks come up, these little male
[23:15.380 --> 23:18.900]  flowers, they look like little bananas, you guys. It just looks like maybe a piece of rice.
[23:20.100 --> 23:23.700]  It's a little tiny, tiny micro-sized banana popping up out of your plants. That's a little
[23:23.940 --> 23:28.500]  pollen sack, a little male flower coming out of your female plants. Oftentimes, that stuff will
[23:28.500 --> 23:34.420]  happen late in flower, somewhere between week seven and nine. If you're past week seven,
[23:34.420 --> 23:38.260]  or past, yeah, I'd say past week seven and you see those, you've got a decision to make. Anytime
[23:38.260 --> 23:42.660]  before week seven, you guys, if I see that shit, that plant is dead. I just murder it.
[23:42.660 --> 23:46.420]  I've got availability to more plants. I've got access to seeds and clones like you wouldn't
[23:46.420 --> 23:51.140]  believe. I'm a little picky. I'm not afraid to euthanize a plant. Sometimes, shit just has to
[23:51.140 --> 23:56.820]  go. If it doesn't work for my grow room, sometimes a certain plant in your environment, that's called
[23:56.820 --> 24:01.620]  a phenotypical expression. The plant will express that it is not happy with your environment and it
[24:01.620 --> 24:04.500]  won't work for you. You just got to get rid of that plant and grow a different plant.
[24:05.300 --> 24:09.380]  If you start seeing those bananas popping up around week six or seven or eight,
[24:09.380 --> 24:13.220]  you have a decision to make. If they're popping up around week nine, it's not that bad because
[24:13.220 --> 24:16.740]  you've only got a few days left. Most plants are going to go about nine, maybe 10 weeks.
[24:17.300 --> 24:21.700]  If you've got a plant that you're ending up week seven and you start seeing little nanners popping
[24:21.700 --> 24:26.500]  up, you want to figure out if you want to keep that plant going. Is it worth risking the rest
[24:26.500 --> 24:31.380]  of the garden? Sometimes those little bananas are sterile and they don't produce pollen.
[24:31.380 --> 24:37.220]  Sometimes one of those can rupture and it will pollinate the plant that that banana is on and
[24:37.220 --> 24:42.900]  it will pollinate the plants all around that plant as well. Sometimes it can pollinate the whole room.
[24:43.140 --> 24:47.860]  It doesn't take much pollen to create seeds and so now you'll have seeds in all of your plants.
[24:47.860 --> 24:53.700]  You've got a decision to make. Do you want to try to eliminate the plant? Do you want to risk it? Or
[24:53.700 --> 24:58.340]  do you want to try to get rid of those bananas? What you can do to those little male flowers,
[24:59.140 --> 25:04.820]  you can mist them with water because water deactivates pollen. Just mist the plant with
[25:04.820 --> 25:09.940]  water and then get some tweezers and pluck out those little nanners. If you're around week eight,
[25:09.940 --> 25:14.020]  week nine, just pluck those out if you want to. If you're in week nine, just leave it there and
[25:14.020 --> 25:18.740]  don't touch it until you harvest and you should be just fine. If it's popping up at week nine,
[25:18.740 --> 25:24.020]  it's probably sterile. But sometimes it's scary and you don't want to risk it around week seven
[25:24.020 --> 25:27.380]  or week eight. You might want to pluck them out. It's up to you. That's when you have a decision
[25:27.380 --> 25:32.980]  to make. But if you're a breeder, do not ever breed with a plant that'll make a hermaphrodite,
[25:32.980 --> 25:38.100]  a little pop up, a little male plant around week seven, eight or nine. Don't do that because
[25:38.100 --> 25:40.900]  then you're going to breed that hermaphroditic trait into something.
[25:41.700 --> 25:46.500]  So make sure you pull out the hermaphrodites. Keep an eye on that. That's a decision you're
[25:46.500 --> 25:49.940]  going to have to make. That's going to happen at some point in your grow career. You're going to
[25:49.940 --> 25:55.460]  see a female plant popping up a male flower at week eight and you're going to panic. But don't
[25:55.460 --> 26:00.420]  worry, it's not the end of the world. You can either pluck out that male, you can let it grow,
[26:00.420 --> 26:05.140]  or you can just destroy the plant. It's up to you. You can always turn those seeded plants into really
[26:05.140 --> 26:11.700]  good hash. I think plants that are allowed to seed make better hash than plants without seeds.
[26:11.700 --> 26:17.140]  You don't get as much hash sometimes, but I think that the high is better once you allow the plants
[26:17.140 --> 26:21.380]  to make seeds. And I only know that because I breed and sometimes when I breed there's material
[26:21.380 --> 26:24.420]  left over. Well, most of the time when I breed there's material left over. You have to separate
[26:24.420 --> 26:31.220]  the seeds from the actual bud and we will run the bud material and turn it into BHO. And I like the
[26:31.220 --> 26:36.980]  seeded BHO. There's no seeds in the BHO, but I mean it comes from seeded materials. Seeds are removed,
[26:36.980 --> 26:42.340]  then we run the material. The seeds are packaged and grown and then the material is turned into
[26:42.340 --> 26:49.300]  hash. And that hash seems to get me a little bit better of a buzz. That's my opinion. I talked
[26:49.300 --> 26:56.340]  earlier about new growers not breeding and hermaphrodites are a little bit of why. Let me
[26:56.340 --> 27:03.220]  touch on why I said please don't breed if you're a new grower. Breeding takes a very selective eye.
[27:03.220 --> 27:07.380]  You need to understand what plants you're putting together. And if you're putting a plant, a plant
[27:07.380 --> 27:12.340]  needs to be properly tested before it's bred. I have talked about how I stress test a plant before
[27:12.340 --> 27:17.140]  I'll breed with it. I'll take a girl plant and I will try to piss that plant off the best I can
[27:17.140 --> 27:21.940]  and see what it takes to make that plant hermaphrodite or die or stress or whatever.
[27:22.580 --> 27:28.260]  And I make sure it's not going to herm on me. And more importantly, I make sure that the progeny,
[27:28.260 --> 27:32.180]  the offspring, the seeds that come from that female plant, I make sure that they're not going
[27:32.180 --> 27:38.500]  to hermaphrodite on you. So you have to have a plant, you have to stress the shit out of it,
[27:38.500 --> 27:44.420]  you have to have a properly selected male. The eye for male selection is a skill. I plan to have a
[27:44.420 --> 27:48.180]  conversation with other breeders on this show about male selection, so we'll give you a heads
[27:48.180 --> 27:54.420]  up on that. But selecting a male is definitely a special skill. Selecting plants for breeding is
[27:54.420 --> 27:59.220]  a, it's a skill, it's an art. And if you're not experienced with the plants you're using,
[27:59.220 --> 28:03.060]  you may breed some bullshit and then you're going to have a bunch of seeds and you're going to give
[28:03.060 --> 28:08.100]  those seeds out and you're going to grow those bullshit seeds. And it's going to, the whole idea
[28:08.100 --> 28:14.260]  of breeding cannabis is to improve the genetics, to improve the race, to make the plant better.
[28:14.260 --> 28:17.700]  And if you're breeding bullshit into it, you're just watering it down and you're spreading
[28:17.700 --> 28:22.340]  genetics that are a waste of time, that are a waste of people's garden space when they could
[28:22.340 --> 28:27.380]  have been growing some usable medicine that would have worked for them. So I'm not dissing any new
[28:27.380 --> 28:31.300]  growers. I'm just asking you, please don't try to breed until you're a little more familiar with the
[28:31.300 --> 28:36.580]  plant. If you have to listen to a podcast and learn how to sex your plant, then you're not ready to
[28:36.580 --> 28:41.620]  breed. And I'm just being honest with you. Learn slowly. And then when you're ready to breed, I'll
[28:41.620 --> 28:45.780]  be here to help you out. I'm not trying to get rid of you. I'm just trying to be honest with you.
[28:45.780 --> 28:49.860]  That's the truth. Learn how to grow and then we'll learn how to breed. You got to learn to ride the
[28:49.860 --> 28:53.940]  bike before you can do wheelies, brah. All right. It feels like I've been going on for about 30
[28:53.940 --> 28:58.020]  minutes. Let's see. Look at that. You guys, I went 29 minutes and I didn't even make any notes. I
[28:58.020 --> 29:01.540]  didn't look at the clock. That was a great episode. I feel like I did a good job. I hope you
[29:01.540 --> 29:07.460]  guys enjoyed listening to that little lesson on how to sex your ganja plants. I want to start
[29:07.460 --> 29:12.260]  wrapping up the show. You guys make sure that you check out my favorite glass company, Hitman Glass.
