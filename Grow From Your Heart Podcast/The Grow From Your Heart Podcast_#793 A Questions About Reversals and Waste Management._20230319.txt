[00:01.150 --> 00:22.140]  All right, here we go.
[00:22.140 --> 00:23.780]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:23.780 --> 00:25.340]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.340 --> 00:30.320]  This is episode 793 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.220]  In this episode, I'm going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:33.220 --> 00:38.660]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of Irie Genetic Seeds.
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.340]  Hang out, we'll talk more about that later in this episode.
[00:41.340 --> 00:45.620]  I do want to remind you that Irie Genetics will be at the Dude Groves Cup this year.
[00:45.620 --> 00:49.580]  That's right, we are participating in the Dude Groves Cup June 3rd in Fort Collins,
[00:49.580 --> 00:50.580]  Colorado.
[00:50.580 --> 00:55.740]  Make sure you check out dudegroves.com or dgccup.com for all of the information.
[00:55.740 --> 01:00.640]  Also make sure you check out Irie Direct for a new restock and reduced pricing.
[01:00.640 --> 01:03.620]  I think that is all of the advertising and business to cover here at the start of the
[01:03.620 --> 01:04.620]  show.
[01:04.620 --> 01:07.620]  Let's jump into the email portion of today's podcast.
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.420]  This question came from the Grow Help tab.
[01:09.420 --> 01:14.460]  If you go to my website, ireegenetics.com, there's a tab on the top right that says questions.
[01:14.460 --> 01:18.020]  If you click on that tab, we will ask you a few questions about your grow.
[01:18.020 --> 01:19.020]  What strain are you growing?
[01:19.020 --> 01:20.020]  Where are you growing it?
[01:20.020 --> 01:21.020]  Is it indoors, outdoors?
[01:21.020 --> 01:22.860]  How are your temps and humidity?
[01:22.860 --> 01:23.860]  Would you feed the plants?
[01:23.860 --> 01:27.700]  Then we give you plenty of opportunity to explain the problem in your garden.
[01:27.700 --> 01:30.300]  I do invite you to send those questions to the Grow Help tab.
[01:30.300 --> 01:33.260]  This question came from our friend Brad in Canada.
[01:33.260 --> 01:35.980]  Big shout out to my friend Brad in Canada for the great question.
[01:35.980 --> 01:37.220]  It goes a lot like this.
[01:37.220 --> 01:38.900]  It says, hello Rasta Jeff.
[01:38.900 --> 01:42.380]  If you read this on the podcast, you can call me Brad from Canada.
[01:42.380 --> 01:43.380]  What's up dude?
[01:43.380 --> 01:44.380]  Nice to meet you.
[01:44.380 --> 01:45.380]  I love the podcast.
[01:45.380 --> 01:49.420]  I've listened to every episode that's available on Spotify and it has quickly become my favorite
[01:49.420 --> 01:51.020]  growing podcast.
[01:51.020 --> 01:55.180]  I do appreciate that you are listening on Spotify, but I do highly recommend that you
[01:55.180 --> 01:57.300]  check out the YouTube videos.
[01:57.300 --> 01:59.460]  Every single episode is available on YouTube.
[01:59.460 --> 02:03.260]  Well, let me say that over because not every single episode is on YouTube.
[02:03.260 --> 02:07.540]  YouTube has taken some down, but there are a lot more episodes available on YouTube than
[02:07.540 --> 02:08.940]  there are Spotify.
[02:08.940 --> 02:12.580]  There's probably 785 episodes on YouTube.
[02:12.900 --> 02:15.820]  Spotify only gives us the most 100 recent, I believe.
[02:15.820 --> 02:18.180]  So there's a lot more content on YouTube.
[02:18.180 --> 02:21.820]  Also come check out the 4K video and see my smiling face.
[02:21.820 --> 02:22.820]  Let me keep going.
[02:22.820 --> 02:24.740]  I do appreciate that you're listening on Spotify, by the way.
[02:24.740 --> 02:27.860]  Let me say that, but I do invite you to check out the YouTube channel.
[02:27.860 --> 02:28.860]  Let me keep going.
[02:28.860 --> 02:31.660]  It said I'm becoming my favorite growing podcast.
[02:31.660 --> 02:36.380]  Your deep dives and out of the box creative thinking such as 18.6 for the last 10 days
[02:36.380 --> 02:37.380]  of flowering.
[02:37.380 --> 02:38.380]  So thank you.
[02:38.380 --> 02:39.380]  Thank you for noticing that.
[02:39.380 --> 02:40.380]  I do appreciate that.
[02:40.380 --> 02:46.060]  It says, or 18.6 for bigger, stronger, faster finishing seeds is truly one of a kind information.
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.060]  You can only learn here.
[02:47.060 --> 02:49.060]  I appreciate you, dude.
[02:49.060 --> 02:53.180]  Those are great compliments and I get a lot of controversy, a lot of feedback, a lot of
[02:53.180 --> 02:57.500]  a lot of flack, I guess, for teaching people to run their plants on 18.6 at the end of
[02:57.500 --> 02:58.500]  flower.
[02:58.500 --> 02:59.500]  A lot of people say I'm crazy.
[02:59.500 --> 03:01.740]  A lot of people have sent negative feedback, but guess what?
[03:01.740 --> 03:06.060]  The only people that tell me I'm a lunatic, the only people that tell me it's a bad idea
[03:06.060 --> 03:07.300]  are people who haven't tried it.
[03:07.300 --> 03:11.500]  People that try to run their plants 18.6 for the last 10 to 14 days of the flowering
[03:11.500 --> 03:12.500]  phase.
[03:12.500 --> 03:14.900]  They always come back and they say, dude, my plants were better.
[03:14.900 --> 03:15.900]  They were beefier.
[03:15.900 --> 03:16.900]  They were chunkier.
[03:16.900 --> 03:18.820]  There was more to it and they finished a little bit sooner.
[03:18.820 --> 03:23.280]  People that make seeds under the 18.6 schedule at the end, they always tell me they have
[03:23.280 --> 03:24.540]  great success with the seed.
[03:24.540 --> 03:26.980]  So thank you for noticing the 18.6 idea.
[03:26.980 --> 03:27.980]  Thank you for trying that.
[03:27.980 --> 03:29.420]  I'm glad that worked out for you.
[03:29.420 --> 03:30.420]  It goes on.
[03:30.420 --> 03:36.140]  It says, anyhow, on today's podcast, you mentioned watching out for expired fertilizers and how
[03:36.140 --> 03:38.420]  they can negatively affect your grow.
[03:38.420 --> 03:43.500]  I was hoping you could go over how to properly dispose of your gross waste products such
[03:43.500 --> 03:47.220]  as bottles of fertilizer, runoff, pesticides, et cetera.
[03:47.220 --> 03:48.700]  Thanks again for all you do.
[03:48.700 --> 03:49.740]  Brad from Canada.
[03:49.740 --> 03:51.740]  This is a very great question.
[03:51.740 --> 03:53.140]  This is a very important question.
[03:53.140 --> 03:58.020]  This is something that I feel is very overlooked in the commercial and private production of
[03:58.020 --> 03:59.020]  cannabis.
[03:59.020 --> 04:03.700]  I am trained by the Colorado Department of Agriculture to understand pesticide handling,
[04:03.700 --> 04:04.700]  pesticide application.
[04:04.740 --> 04:06.660]  I understand mixing nutrients safely.
[04:06.660 --> 04:08.660]  I understand applying nutrients safely.
[04:08.660 --> 04:12.820]  However, in the state of Colorado for the Marijuana Enforcement Division and the Colorado
[04:12.820 --> 04:16.820]  Department of Agriculture and Public Health and Environment, which are two different entities,
[04:16.820 --> 04:23.980]  I kind of combined them, but there is technically no protocol for disposing of wastewater, excess
[04:23.980 --> 04:26.620]  nutrients, excess pesticides.
[04:26.620 --> 04:30.920]  There's no true protocol for that in a commercial cultivation facility.
[04:30.920 --> 04:33.260]  My main concern is the pesticides.
[04:33.300 --> 04:37.980]  I really, really try when we are creating a batch of pesticides to apply, I try not
[04:37.980 --> 04:39.100]  to make too much.
[04:39.100 --> 04:43.060]  I'd rather have almost too little or just barely enough to coat the room to get the
[04:43.060 --> 04:46.860]  job done so I don't have to figure out what to do with the leftover pesticides.
[04:46.860 --> 04:48.460]  Honestly, we just spray.
[04:48.460 --> 04:51.660]  Just keep spraying until you run out because that's your best option.
[04:51.660 --> 04:52.660]  Apply it to the plants.
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.900]  Apply it to the walls if you need to.
[04:53.900 --> 04:54.900]  Hit the floor.
[04:54.900 --> 04:58.820]  I try not to waste it by pouring it into the water supply or into the ground.
[04:58.940 --> 05:04.060]  So pesticides, my main mission is to just mix up just enough and coat the rooms.
[05:04.060 --> 05:08.800]  After several applications, I've been applying in several locations for so long that basically
[05:08.800 --> 05:11.100]  we know exactly how much to mix up per room.
[05:11.100 --> 05:12.540]  For that room, I need seven gallons.
[05:12.540 --> 05:15.580]  For that room, I'm just pointing at arbitrary rooms that exist in my head.
[05:15.580 --> 05:17.700]  I know that that one room takes about seven gallons.
[05:17.700 --> 05:20.340]  That other room only needs about three and a half gallons.
[05:20.340 --> 05:23.680]  So most of my method there is strategy and not mixing up too much to where I have any
[05:23.680 --> 05:26.780]  waste or leftovers, which sometimes I nail it.
[05:26.780 --> 05:30.260]  Honestly, sometimes we don't and then we do have to get creative with the disposal
[05:30.260 --> 05:31.260]  of those nutrients.
[05:31.260 --> 05:36.140]  The Department of Ag has taught us that dilution is the solution to pollution.
[05:36.140 --> 05:40.120]  So if you've got to pour it somewhere, mix it heavily with regular water and dispose
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.120]  of it.
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.660]  That does not sound like the greatest idea, but that's what I was instructed by the Department
[05:44.660 --> 05:48.660]  of Ag was to pour it down the floor drain and dilute it with regular water.
[05:48.660 --> 05:52.500]  Now let's talk more about the nutrients, waste nutrients.
[05:52.500 --> 05:57.340]  In a commercial grow, it would not be uncommon for me to mix up a 500 gallon reservoir of
[05:57.340 --> 06:00.220]  nutrients and then feed most of that to the plants.
[06:00.220 --> 06:01.220]  Then there is runoff.
[06:01.220 --> 06:05.340]  In most cases, you hear me preach about watering to runoff.
[06:05.340 --> 06:10.900]  Unfortunately, once again, there is not a protocol with the Colorado Department of Agriculture,
[06:10.900 --> 06:12.460]  the Department of Health, OSHA.
[06:12.460 --> 06:18.020]  Nobody's given us a true standard operating procedure of how to dispose of the leftover
[06:18.020 --> 06:19.020]  nutrients.
[06:19.020 --> 06:21.020]  Luckily, I was going to say fortunately.
[06:21.020 --> 06:25.680]  So fortunately, at one of the facilities where I spent most of my time, the facility was
[06:25.680 --> 06:29.240]  out in what would be considered a big field in the middle of a desert area.
[06:29.240 --> 06:32.380]  So there's just a bunch of brush out there, a bunch of sagebrush, a bunch of cactus, a
[06:32.380 --> 06:34.620]  bunch of yucca, a bunch of dirt.
[06:34.620 --> 06:36.300]  And that's what was behind our facility.
[06:36.300 --> 06:40.120]  So most of the time, if we had excess water, we would pour that water into the dirt and
[06:40.120 --> 06:44.620]  water those plants, which was amazing because all of the vegetation behind our facility
[06:44.620 --> 06:47.300]  was lush and gigantic year round.
[06:47.300 --> 06:50.220]  Everywhere else, it would turn brown, it would get dusty and crunchy.
[06:50.220 --> 06:53.780]  Our vegetation behind our facility, around our facility was beautiful.
[06:53.780 --> 06:54.780]  It was huge.
[06:54.780 --> 06:59.580]  Also, we got some giant rabbits and some giant rattlesnakes and a bunch of giant life because
[06:59.580 --> 07:02.140]  I think we were feeding the plants so well, there was a lot of food.
[07:02.140 --> 07:03.140]  Food was abundant.
[07:03.140 --> 07:06.820]  The animals were abundant, which made the rattlesnakes abundant, which made the birds
[07:06.820 --> 07:07.820]  abundant.
[07:07.820 --> 07:09.140]  There was a lot of shit happening in our area.
[07:09.140 --> 07:11.860]  And I think a lot of it was because of the nutrients which we were dumping out there
[07:11.860 --> 07:14.900]  in that field and feeding all of those weeds, all of those plants.
[07:14.900 --> 07:18.540]  We were giving them high quality grow nutrients and boosting the shit out of them.
[07:18.540 --> 07:23.340]  So that was how we were disposing of the excess water, the nutrients.
[07:23.340 --> 07:26.300]  Unfortunately, we were told that that should go down the floor drain.
[07:26.300 --> 07:29.460]  I did not agree with that, but I did not know what else to do.
[07:29.460 --> 07:34.060]  So unfortunately, there was not a strong protocol by any of the governing bodies that kind of
[07:34.060 --> 07:36.100]  oversee the production of cannabis.
[07:36.100 --> 07:39.860]  We were basically told that the standard operating procedure and the thing to do would be to
[07:39.860 --> 07:44.420]  pour it down the floor drain or to continue putting it in the backyard like I was doing.
[07:44.940 --> 07:48.340]  I never felt good putting a pesticide in a floor drain, but that's what we were instructed
[07:48.340 --> 07:49.340]  to do.
[07:49.340 --> 07:50.380]  And sometimes they did not have any other option.
[07:50.380 --> 07:54.100]  So just pour it down the floor drain and pour a bunch of gallons of water on top of it.
[07:54.100 --> 07:55.780]  That way we kind of dilute that a little bit.
[07:55.780 --> 07:59.000]  I wish there was a better answer to this, honestly, because it doesn't feel good telling
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.980]  you that the protocol was to pour shit in the backyard and pour it down a drain.
[08:02.980 --> 08:05.000]  But in Colorado, there is no rule.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  We were never fined.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.300]  We were never told to do any differently.
[08:07.300 --> 08:08.940]  We were never given any guidance.
[08:08.940 --> 08:11.940]  And when I said that's what we were doing, the Department of Ag basically turned their
[08:11.940 --> 08:14.060]  head and said, I guess that's what you got to do.
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.060]  So I agree with you.
[08:15.060 --> 08:18.860]  That's not the best way to do it, but that's the option that I was given.
[08:18.860 --> 08:22.880]  So that's basically how we got rid of the runoff fertilizers and the pesticides.
[08:22.880 --> 08:26.580]  You did ask about a couple of other products, bottles of fertilizer.
[08:26.580 --> 08:29.180]  We would basically use the fertilizer in a commercial grow.
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.420]  We would use that to the end.
[08:30.420 --> 08:31.900]  There would never be anything left.
[08:31.900 --> 08:33.380]  Nothing would expire in a commercial grow.
[08:33.380 --> 08:35.900]  That stuff comes and goes very quickly.
[08:35.900 --> 08:40.860]  If you are disposing of a pesticide or a nutrient bottle, the proper protocol is to poke a bunch
[08:40.860 --> 08:45.980]  of holes in that bottle near the bottom around the sides so that nobody can reuse that container
[08:45.980 --> 08:46.980]  and get themselves sick.
[08:46.980 --> 08:51.980]  A pesticide bottle, a nutrient bottle, it's got to be punctured several times.
[08:51.980 --> 08:55.900]  And then those punctured bottles would go into a dumpster that had to be locked.
[08:55.900 --> 09:00.180]  Also into that dumpster would go all of our root balls, a lot of our organic waste, a
[09:00.180 --> 09:04.060]  lot of the sticks, the stems, a lot of the trim that we didn't use to send out to get
[09:04.060 --> 09:05.060]  extracted.
[09:05.060 --> 09:09.160]  Any waste would go into a big dumpster, old pots, old soil.
[09:09.160 --> 09:12.200]  Just about all of the waste would get put into one dumpster that was required to be
[09:12.200 --> 09:17.600]  locked and only the facility manager, which was myself most of the time, and the person
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.180]  that picked up the trash had a key to that dumpster.
[09:20.180 --> 09:24.400]  You would not believe how many times people cut the lock off of our dumpster, tried to
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.360]  break into our dumpster, destroyed our dumpster to get what they thought was product, but
[09:28.360 --> 09:31.400]  it was actually nothing but sticks and dirt and waste.
[09:31.400 --> 09:35.520]  When you throw something away, if there is plant material in your waste and you throw
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.100]  that away in Colorado, it's got to be destroyed.
[09:38.100 --> 09:42.140]  It's either got to be mixed with bleach or they like it if you mix it with kitty litter.
[09:42.140 --> 09:45.940]  A lot of the times what I would do is when we harvest it, I would save a couple of pots
[09:45.940 --> 09:50.100]  behind, three gallon pots filled with cocoa, so that way when it came time to blend in
[09:50.100 --> 09:53.540]  the waste from all the plants, I could dump some of that cocoa on top of it, put some
[09:53.540 --> 09:56.660]  plants in there, dump cocoa on top of it, put plants in there.
[09:56.660 --> 10:00.600]  Basically they wanted you to make a lasagna of plant waste and then something to destroy
[10:00.600 --> 10:03.940]  the plant waste and then more waste so that when the people do come in and break into
[10:03.940 --> 10:07.060]  the trash cans, if they do get something, they don't really get a product, they can
[10:07.060 --> 10:09.620]  make any profit or any consumption off of.
[10:09.620 --> 10:14.140]  They were trying, they were trying, but some of the MED rules were completely ridiculous.
[10:14.140 --> 10:17.820]  Since I'm thinking about it, I've got footage, I probably don't have the footage on my phone
[10:17.820 --> 10:18.820]  anymore.
[10:18.820 --> 10:22.820]  I worked for a facility that was kind of tucked back off of the main street.
[10:22.820 --> 10:26.300]  Any traffic that went by there was just weirdo traffic looking for problems.
[10:26.300 --> 10:29.460]  A lot of people would come by on bikes and shine flashlights in our growth facility.
[10:29.460 --> 10:33.300]  We had to build a 12 foot fence around the facility and keep the trash can inside the
[10:33.300 --> 10:36.700]  12 foot fence and still walk the trash can because people are crazy.
[10:36.860 --> 10:40.820]  Anyway, one night a homeless person climbed over, I assume they were homeless.
[10:40.820 --> 10:41.820]  I'd seen them around there.
[10:41.820 --> 10:47.260]  I'd never, they looked very, maybe I'm prejudging, but this person that did not look like they'd
[10:47.260 --> 10:49.580]  had a shower in a while, that part was quite obvious.
[10:49.580 --> 10:50.820]  They climbed our fence.
[10:50.820 --> 10:52.140]  They tried to get into the trash can.
[10:52.140 --> 10:53.340]  They couldn't get into it.
[10:53.340 --> 10:57.060]  So they shimmied up one of the rain gutters and got to the roof of the building, jumped
[10:57.060 --> 11:01.940]  off the roof WWF style and shoulder bombed their way through the top of our dumpster.
[11:01.940 --> 11:03.980]  The metal lid of the dumpster caved in.
[11:03.980 --> 11:05.720]  A bunch of dust came flying up.
[11:05.740 --> 11:07.200]  You saw them fall through it.
[11:07.200 --> 11:08.840]  They looked disheveled for a couple of seconds.
[11:08.840 --> 11:10.280]  They got their shit together.
[11:10.280 --> 11:12.840]  They looked like they just won the freaking lottery.
[11:12.840 --> 11:15.920]  But then when they threw those bags over the fence, they left them there because they realized
[11:15.920 --> 11:18.580]  it wasn't nothing but sticks and fucking kitty litter.
[11:18.580 --> 11:23.000]  So this person climbed up our rain gutter, got all the way to the roof of the building
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.160]  and WWE or WWF style jumped off the fucking building through our dumpster to attempt to
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.880]  steal our trash.
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.880]  That's how ridiculous it was.
[11:31.880 --> 11:36.600]  So everything that went into that dumpster had to be destroyed, punctured, mixed with
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.880]  kitty litter, ground to a pulp, and then the dumpster had to be locked.
[11:39.880 --> 11:42.640]  It was behind two gates in some facilities.
[11:42.640 --> 11:44.920]  The trash was a very, uh, it was a huge target.
[11:44.920 --> 11:47.920]  I've never had my trash targeted like that before.
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.240]  So let me recap and make sure I've answered all of the aspects of this question.
[11:52.240 --> 11:54.000]  Dispose of the grow waste products.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.760]  I consider grow waste products to be plants, pots, stuff like that.
[11:57.760 --> 12:00.240]  That goes into the locked dumpster.
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.240]  Bottles of fertilizer.
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.600]  Use all of the liquid inside of those bottles.
[12:04.600 --> 12:06.520]  Everything gets used in a commercial facility.
[12:06.520 --> 12:10.760]  When you're mixing up 500 gallons of nutrients, if you've just got a little bit extra, just
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.760]  pour it in.
[12:11.760 --> 12:12.760]  It'll be fine.
[12:12.760 --> 12:13.760]  It won't make a difference for one feeding.
[12:13.760 --> 12:15.440]  If it's a little bit, guys, don't go get crazy.
[12:15.440 --> 12:17.440]  But so the bottles get punctured, runoff.
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.760]  Again, we did not have any guidance or expertise on what to do with the runoff.
[12:21.760 --> 12:24.700]  I was pouring it in the field and feeding the vegetation.
[12:24.700 --> 12:29.680]  The pesticides, we do our best, our absolute best to mix up enough for this application
[12:29.800 --> 12:31.200]  so that none is wasted.
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.760]  And then if you need to overspray, go spray some foliage outside, something like that
[12:34.760 --> 12:36.200]  if you really have to.
[12:36.200 --> 12:37.600]  So I think that wraps up that question.
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.320]  I do want to send another big thank you shout out to our friend Brad from Canada.
[12:41.320 --> 12:42.920]  Congratulations to Brad from Canada.
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.520]  My dude, you have won yourself a free pack of IRI genetic seeds.

[13:00.240 --> 13:02.180]  But congratulations Brad from Canada.
[13:02.180 --> 13:04.920]  You have won a free pack of IRI genetic seeds.
[13:04.920 --> 13:08.980]  Most of the time I do limit the seed giveaways to the states, but I liked your question quite
[13:08.980 --> 13:12.960]  a bit so I will eat the cost and ship that right up there to Canada for you.
[13:12.960 --> 13:17.320]  Brad, please do send me your shipping address so I can get you a free pack of seeds.
[13:17.320 --> 13:22.040]  I've said before that if I read your question here on the podcast, you will win a free pack
[13:22.040 --> 13:23.040]  of seeds.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.040]  All right, let's keep moving.
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.100]  I've got another great question in front of me.
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.860]  This one came from our friend Daniel.
[13:27.860 --> 13:29.240]  Big shout out to Daniel.
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.180]  It says, what kind of grow question do you have?
[13:32.180 --> 13:37.720]  And Daniel said, how viable is a breeding project that is solely based on using pollen
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.840]  from reversed females?
[13:39.840 --> 13:40.840]  That's a really good question.
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.080]  It says, I want to get into breeding, but my current circumstances greatly favor growing
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.060]  fem auto flowers over photos.
[13:48.060 --> 13:51.060]  I'm assuming I'm able to readily reverse them.
[13:51.060 --> 13:54.980]  Are there significant downsides compared to using males?
[13:54.980 --> 13:56.980]  This is a really good question.
[13:56.980 --> 14:01.340]  Some of the info that I'm going to give you, this next piece of info comes from my friend,
[14:01.340 --> 14:02.340]  Mr. Soul.
[14:02.340 --> 14:04.440]  Big shout out to Mr. Soul at Brothers Grimm Seed Company.
[14:04.440 --> 14:05.660]  Go support him.
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.660]  Really good dude.
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.420]  Very, very smart guy.
[14:08.420 --> 14:13.500]  I agree with 99% of what he says when it comes to talking about cannabis and almost anything
[14:13.500 --> 14:17.060]  else, which is very rare for me to agree with somebody that much.
[14:17.060 --> 14:18.820]  99% is huge agreement.
[14:18.820 --> 14:21.140]  So big fist bump to my buddy, Mr. Soul.
[14:21.140 --> 14:23.620]  Mr. Soul put it this way one time.
[14:23.620 --> 14:29.140]  The only difference between regular and feminized seeds, the main difference, the difference
[14:29.140 --> 14:30.660]  is the pollen.
[14:30.660 --> 14:35.580]  The female pollen is what is creating female seeds on your plant.
[14:35.580 --> 14:40.040]  Basically imagine this is not how it works, but you can imagine it this way.
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.300]  Imagine if I were able to create a filter and put a filter in the air and that filter
[14:44.300 --> 14:47.700]  only removed male pollen from the air at new.
[14:47.700 --> 14:49.860]  It's like female pollen, you can go ahead and party.
[14:49.860 --> 14:50.860]  You could get through.
[14:50.860 --> 14:52.780]  It's ladies night, but male pollen.
[14:52.780 --> 14:53.780]  No way, bro.
[14:53.780 --> 14:54.780]  You're staying outside.
[14:54.780 --> 14:58.100]  So imagine I've got this filter and then I make my plant produce pollen.
[14:58.100 --> 15:03.460]  All we are doing is eliminating the male pollen from the equation and that female pollen is
[15:03.460 --> 15:07.300]  hitting the plants and making 100% female seeds.
[15:07.300 --> 15:09.180]  My friend, Mr. Soul put it that way.
[15:09.180 --> 15:11.600]  He gave me the analogy of using the filter.
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.980]  That is very much what it's like when breeding with a reversed female.
[15:14.980 --> 15:17.860]  The only difference that you're going to, okay, there may be another difference I'll
[15:17.860 --> 15:21.380]  get into, but the only difference that you're going to notice is that it's going to be all
[15:21.780 --> 15:25.180]  female seeds because there is no male pollen in the mix.
[15:25.180 --> 15:30.120]  That's where we are reversing the female plant because we're making female pollen.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.180]  That's where the magic happens.
[15:31.180 --> 15:34.100]  The female pollen is the key to all that feminization.
[15:34.100 --> 15:35.220]  So it's all female pollen.
[15:35.220 --> 15:37.460]  I said, there's one more thing you may notice.
[15:37.460 --> 15:44.940]  The thing you're going to notice is more uniform phenotypes and less transgressive segregation.
[15:44.940 --> 15:49.940]  A lot of times when we work with regular seeds, when we make further filial generations, we
[15:49.940 --> 15:54.260]  will see expressions of the grandparents and the grandma and the grandpa and the great
[15:54.260 --> 15:56.500]  grandma and the great grandpa on both sides.
[15:56.500 --> 16:00.780]  So you've got the options of more things popping up in your mix if you're using the regular
[16:00.780 --> 16:01.900]  seeds.
[16:01.900 --> 16:04.140]  Using fem seeds, I think we kind of cut some of that out.
[16:04.140 --> 16:10.660]  We get less phenotypical expression, less variation, and more uniformity in my experience
[16:10.660 --> 16:12.820]  with the plants that I have selected.
[16:12.820 --> 16:17.460]  If you select different plants and go a different route in your breeding, that could vary just
[16:17.460 --> 16:19.300]  because of the plants that were chosen.
[16:19.340 --> 16:23.740]  I feel like over time I've developed a very discerning eye, a very keen eye for selecting
[16:23.740 --> 16:25.020]  breeding pairs.
[16:25.020 --> 16:29.100]  And this far in my breeding game, I really do see very nice phenotypes coming from the
[16:29.100 --> 16:32.900]  fems and less variation than what I see coming from the regular seeds.
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.260]  I make plenty of both.
[16:34.260 --> 16:37.700]  I make a lot of feminized seeds and I make a lot of regular seeds.
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.900]  I grow a lot of them out.
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.820]  My test team grows a lot of them out.
[16:40.820 --> 16:42.860]  My testing is 100% transparent.
[16:42.860 --> 16:44.180]  We do it on Discord.
[16:44.180 --> 16:45.180]  Everybody can see it.
[16:45.180 --> 16:47.780]  Then a lot of people grow out the seeds that make it to market.
[16:47.780 --> 16:53.220]  I'm seeing less variation in the feminized seeds than I am in the regular seeds.
[16:53.220 --> 16:55.260]  So that's possibly an advantage.
[16:55.260 --> 16:57.940]  I like the variation that is coming from the regular seeds.
[16:57.940 --> 16:59.260]  That's why I like doing reg seeds.
[16:59.260 --> 17:03.540]  I like seeing how the male expresses, how the female expresses, what the difference
[17:03.540 --> 17:08.780]  is if I take this male and pollinate four different females, how does that express differently?
[17:08.780 --> 17:12.260]  It will be clear what that reversed plant is contributing to your breeding project.
[17:12.260 --> 17:16.180]  If you pollinate multiple females with that plant and see what the differences are, you'll
[17:16.180 --> 17:20.060]  be able to see, oh, when I pollinated the strawberry plant with this blueberry plant,
[17:20.060 --> 17:21.340]  we got strawberry blueberry.
[17:21.340 --> 17:25.620]  But when I pollinated the orange plant with the blueberry, the orange really dominated.
[17:25.620 --> 17:29.820]  But if I pollinated Durban poison with the blueberry, the Durban poison really dominated.
[17:29.820 --> 17:33.860]  You'll get to see what traits and what dominates in what mix by breeding to other plants.
[17:33.860 --> 17:39.100]  But you won't see as much variation as you would if you were running the regular seeds.
[17:39.100 --> 17:43.420]  In my experience in that test right there, I do see more variation.
[17:43.420 --> 17:47.100]  I see more grandparents represented with the regular seeds.
[17:47.100 --> 17:51.020]  So let me recap the question, make sure I'm giving you a solid answer.
[17:51.020 --> 17:55.140]  How viable is breeding that solely uses pollen from reversed females?
[17:55.140 --> 17:59.660]  Lemon Jeffrey is one of my most popular, best-selling strains.
[17:59.660 --> 18:04.100]  Orange Chasm is definitely, Orange Chasm is my number one selling seed line that I've
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.300]  ever made.
[18:05.300 --> 18:12.460]  Those two crosses are 100% feminized and they are very viable, very potent, very reliable
[18:12.500 --> 18:13.500]  seeds.
[18:13.500 --> 18:16.940]  Lemon Jeffrey and Orange Chasm are probably, those are my two most popular strains I've
[18:16.940 --> 18:20.940]  ever made and they're FEMs made from reversed female pollen.
[18:20.940 --> 18:25.820]  So you can start a seed company that will be very successful with FEM seeds if you do
[18:25.820 --> 18:31.900]  it properly, if you take the proper time for selection, if you make sure, test, test, test,
[18:31.900 --> 18:32.900]  test.
[18:32.900 --> 18:33.900]  I can't say that enough.
[18:33.900 --> 18:35.060]  Test, a lot of testing.
[18:35.060 --> 18:39.820]  Test every female that you plan on putting in your breeding project for all of the problems
[18:39.820 --> 18:41.940]  that a female plant could represent.
[18:41.940 --> 18:44.460]  Let's find out first of all, does it handle heat stress?
[18:44.460 --> 18:45.660]  Does it handle cold stress?
[18:45.660 --> 18:46.700]  Does it handle overfeed?
[18:46.700 --> 18:48.200]  Does it handle underfeed?
[18:48.200 --> 18:49.740]  Does it handle too much heat?
[18:49.740 --> 18:51.360]  Does it handle too much cold?
[18:51.360 --> 18:53.940]  Does it handle high humidity, low humidity?
[18:53.940 --> 18:54.940]  Does it handle drought?
[18:54.940 --> 18:55.940]  Does it handle overwater?
[18:55.940 --> 18:59.860]  I may have repeated a couple of those things, but does it handle all of that shit?
[18:59.860 --> 19:04.780]  Do these plants that you intend to breed with, do they show any type of intersex traits when
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.000]  you beat them up?
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.340]  Can they handle light interruptions?
[19:07.340 --> 19:08.860]  Can they handle darkness interruptions?
[19:08.860 --> 19:10.340]  Can they handle problems?
[19:10.340 --> 19:11.420]  Are they bug resistant?
[19:11.420 --> 19:13.060]  Are they pathogen resistant?
[19:13.060 --> 19:14.680]  Are they friendly to the grower?
[19:14.680 --> 19:17.540]  That is something that I really like to think about when I'm making seeds that will go to
[19:17.540 --> 19:18.700]  other people.
[19:18.700 --> 19:22.700]  Are these seeds going to be a complete pain in the ass or will everyday consumers be able
[19:22.700 --> 19:25.060]  to complete the grow with this product?
[19:25.060 --> 19:27.940]  Think about those traits when you are making seeds.
[19:27.940 --> 19:32.020]  But the short answer is that your idea for a breeding project of feminized only seeds
[19:32.020 --> 19:36.460]  could and will be very successful if the selection is done properly.
[19:36.460 --> 19:40.620]  If you don't select plants that have been tested, tried and true, that's when you can
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.080]  run into problems.
[19:42.080 --> 19:47.100]  If you put one plant into this breeding program that is intersex, all of the offspring from
[19:47.100 --> 19:50.580]  that plant do hold the potential to be intersex plants.
[19:50.580 --> 19:51.740]  So let's test the plants.
[19:51.740 --> 19:56.460]  Let's remove any intersex plants from the gene pool before we do any breeding.
[19:56.460 --> 20:00.440]  Intersex is the number one complaint from a consumer when it comes to buying seeds.
[20:00.440 --> 20:04.040]  If those plants show nanners in week three, people are going to be pissed.
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.520]  If it shows nanners in week six, they're going to be extra pissed.
[20:07.520 --> 20:12.380]  So let's not release anything or breed to anything that has the opportunity or shows
[20:12.380 --> 20:16.240]  the potential to display intersex characteristics.
[20:16.240 --> 20:20.680]  But overall, if you do the selection properly, if you pay attention, if you stress test all
[20:20.680 --> 20:24.400]  of your plants before you breed, pick your plants now.
[20:24.400 --> 20:26.180]  Pick all of the plants you want to breed.
[20:26.180 --> 20:27.880]  Get a mother plant of all of those plants.
[20:27.880 --> 20:30.140]  Have two or three clones of each of those plants.
[20:30.140 --> 20:32.580]  Let's put all the potential breeders in a room.
[20:32.580 --> 20:35.800]  Let's put the light schedule on 12-12 and leave it like that for a few days.
[20:35.800 --> 20:39.660]  But then in a couple of days, I'm going to fuck it all up and put it back on 18-6.
[20:39.660 --> 20:41.840]  Then a few days later from that, I'm going to overwater.
[20:41.840 --> 20:44.840]  Then a couple of days after that, we'll put it back on 12-12 and wait two weeks and see
[20:44.840 --> 20:45.880]  what happens.
[20:45.880 --> 20:47.920]  If any of those plants freak out, guess what?
[20:47.920 --> 20:49.440]  I'm not going to breed with them.
[20:49.440 --> 20:53.840]  The plants that continue through and flower and finish properly, those are my breeding
[20:53.840 --> 20:54.920]  candidates.
[20:54.920 --> 20:58.600]  So run some testing, verify that you've got good quality breeding candidates.
[20:58.600 --> 21:01.560]  And then once you've verified that, that's when you do your pollen chuck.
[21:01.560 --> 21:03.640]  And now that is only the first step.
[21:03.640 --> 21:06.960]  Once you've done the pollen chucking, the next step is to grow out the seeds that you
[21:06.960 --> 21:08.140]  have created.
[21:08.140 --> 21:12.600]  Grow populations as large of a population as you can from each batch and take a lot
[21:12.600 --> 21:13.640]  of notes.
[21:13.640 --> 21:14.780]  Be very observant.
[21:14.780 --> 21:16.320]  Take ridiculous notes.
[21:16.320 --> 21:20.240]  If your plant does something, one weird thing, write it down.
[21:20.240 --> 21:22.860]  If it does some very small thing, write it down.
[21:22.860 --> 21:25.660]  If it does something drastic, definitely write it down.
[21:25.660 --> 21:27.400]  But grow out as many of those as you can.
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.380]  See if the seeds you have produced, like we started with, are they intersex?
[21:31.380 --> 21:32.380]  Did you meet your goal?
[21:32.380 --> 21:33.940]  Do you have a breeding goal?
[21:33.940 --> 21:37.740]  Are the plants that you have created better than both of the parent plants?
[21:37.740 --> 21:41.820]  If they're not quality seeds, I don't recommend sharing them, selling them, or giving them
[21:41.820 --> 21:42.820]  out.
[21:42.820 --> 21:47.300]  Maybe use them for your own or maybe turn them into some sort of oil or put them into
[21:47.300 --> 21:48.700]  the compost bin.
[21:48.700 --> 21:49.980]  You know if you hit your goal or not.
[21:49.980 --> 21:51.180]  You know if they're quality.
[21:51.180 --> 21:54.420]  You know if this is something that you would be proud to share with the community or if
[21:54.420 --> 21:57.160]  it's something you'd rather flush and act like never happened.
[21:57.160 --> 21:58.160]  Don't be ashamed.
[21:58.160 --> 21:59.160]  It's all about selection.
[21:59.160 --> 22:02.060]  If you did not select the proper strains, select again.
[22:02.060 --> 22:03.060]  Get it going again.
[22:03.060 --> 22:06.060]  Now you did mention that you want to use auto flowers.
[22:06.060 --> 22:08.400]  So you're going to have to do this with auto flowers.
[22:08.400 --> 22:11.920]  You're going to have to find an auto flower plant that looks like a good breeding candidate.
[22:11.920 --> 22:13.380]  You're going to have to reverse that.
[22:13.380 --> 22:15.240]  Then put that on several more females.
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.240]  I honestly do not have experience breeding with auto flowers.
[22:19.240 --> 22:21.880]  The selection process there would baffle me.
[22:21.880 --> 22:25.840]  How do I know that that is a breeding male if I haven't flowered it out and finished
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.400]  it and see what it looks like?
[22:28.280 --> 22:30.800]  You can't cut a clone and repeat the process.
[22:30.800 --> 22:33.720]  You're going to have to pick one that looks real good.
[22:33.720 --> 22:36.840]  Reverse it right before it starts to flower.
[22:36.840 --> 22:38.840]  Once again, I don't mess with auto flowers.
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.800]  So I recommend spraying the plant for the first reversal about 10 days, 7 to 10 days
[22:43.800 --> 22:45.200]  before you put it into flower.
[22:45.200 --> 22:47.000]  So you're going to have to time that.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  Spray it.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.840]  Then once it goes into flower, you've got to spray it every three days for about 21
[22:50.840 --> 22:52.240]  to 24 days.
[22:52.240 --> 22:55.740]  You've got to time that to where the females are ready for pollen at the right time.
[22:55.740 --> 22:59.380]  This could be a whole new set of challenges that I don't even know how to adjust for because
[22:59.380 --> 23:01.420]  I'm not familiar with auto flowers.
[23:01.420 --> 23:02.980]  I wish you the best of luck.
[23:02.980 --> 23:05.900]  I do look forward to seeing your breeding project.
[23:05.900 --> 23:08.460]  If you do make seeds, if you do this, send me an update.
[23:08.460 --> 23:11.380]  Let me know how this goes because I would love to know how my guidance helped you.
[23:11.380 --> 23:13.460]  And also maybe my guidance slowed you down.
[23:13.460 --> 23:14.860]  Let me know what I did wrong for you.
[23:14.860 --> 23:16.460]  All right, let me make sure I answered.
[23:16.460 --> 23:20.780]  Assuming I'm able to readily reverse them, are there significant downsides?
[23:20.780 --> 23:22.940]  No, I do not find any downsides.
[23:22.940 --> 23:24.580]  I think this is a great project.
[23:24.580 --> 23:28.300]  I think you're on to the right start and I'm very excited for you to be making your
[23:28.300 --> 23:31.420]  own feminized auto flower seeds.
[23:31.420 --> 23:32.420]  I look forward to it.
[23:32.420 --> 23:36.260]  All right, my friend Daniel, you of course did win a free pack of seeds because I read
[23:36.260 --> 23:39.380]  your message here on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[23:39.380 --> 23:43.260]  Please do send me your address so that I can get your seeds to you.
[23:43.260 --> 23:47.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I did not read your message, your question here on this episode,
[23:47.940 --> 23:49.140]  do not be afraid.
[23:49.140 --> 23:50.220]  Have no fear.
[23:50.220 --> 23:53.840]  There are plenty more episodes coming and I've got a lot more emails stacked up here
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.960]  in front of me.
[23:54.960 --> 23:59.280]  Please continue to send me the emails because I like building listener generated content
[23:59.280 --> 24:03.580]  and I absolutely like giving you guys free seeds for helping build the podcast.
[24:03.580 --> 24:06.860]  So go to the Grow Help tab on iRegenetics.com.
[24:06.860 --> 24:08.800]  Find the little tab that says Help or Questions.
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.300]  I don't remember what it says right now.
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.560]  It says Questions.
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.080]  Click on the one that says Questions.
[24:13.080 --> 24:14.260]  It's obvious from there.
[24:14.260 --> 24:15.260]  Send me your Grow Question.
[24:15.260 --> 24:19.840]  If I read your Grow Question here on this podcast, I will send you a free pack of seeds
[24:19.840 --> 24:21.840]  brought to you by seedsherenow.com.
[24:22.840 --> 24:23.840]  All right.
[24:23.840 --> 24:26.600]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[24:26.600 --> 24:29.080]  You know I'll be back in another week with fresh new content.

[24:35.840 --> 24:36.840]  Don't be shy.
[24:36.840 --> 24:37.840]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.120]  If you've got hate mail, if you've got words of encouragement, go on, send it to me.
[24:41.120 --> 24:42.720]  I'd love to read it.
[24:42.720 --> 24:49.140]  Also make sure you check out the Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[24:49.140 --> 24:51.400]  Everything else you could possibly need is on my website.
[24:51.960 --> 24:52.960]  I read genetics.com.
[24:52.960 --> 24:55.680]  There's a link to the discord, a link to the Patreon.
[24:55.680 --> 24:58.120]  There's a link to I read direct to get brand new seeds.
[24:58.120 --> 25:01.920]  By the way, there's a fresh drop or restock and a price drop on I read direct.
[25:01.920 --> 25:03.600]  Go there before those are gone.
[25:03.600 --> 25:07.000]  The Patreon members did get the first heads up.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  That's all I've got for you.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.280]  I'll be back in another week with fresh new content.
[25:10.280 --> 25:11.280]  Thank you again for listening.
[25:11.280 --> 25:14.680]  I want to give a giant shout out to my good friends at Lollipop Farms.
[25:14.680 --> 25:17.960]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
