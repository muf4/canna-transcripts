[00:00.000 --> 00:05.500]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It's time for Episode 386 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:05.500 --> 00:10.200]  Podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new
[00:10.200 --> 00:15.000]  seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:15.000 --> 00:23.000]  them at www.dankseed.store. I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.840]  smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Star Dog from our friends at Apothecary Farms in
[00:27.840 --> 00:36.480]  Pueblo. The package says it is 64.7% THC and 76.4% total cannabinoids. I always love
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.880]  the Star Dog and they did a great job on this batch. So big shout out to our friends at
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.960]  Apothecary Farms in Pueblo. You guys, in this episode, we are going to do iTunes customer
[00:46.960 --> 00:52.640]  reviews, but before we get there, I'd like to make one big announcement. I'd like to
[00:52.640 --> 00:59.520]  announce that Iry Genetics will be at the Indo Expo on January 26th and 27th in 2019.
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.040]  The Indo Expo is in Denver, Colorado. It is the trade show for people who really know
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.600]  cannabis. I will be at the Oregon Elite Seeds booth representing Colorado. So come find
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.120]  me, grab some Iry Genetics, shake my hand, take a selfie, come say what's up. I'll be
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.240]  at booth 414 and I look forward to meeting you.
[01:17.240 --> 01:22.200]  All right, Podcast World, let's jump right into these iTunes customer reviews. If you
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.000]  would like to leave a review on the podcast on iTunes, I would appreciate your support.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.160]  It is really easy to do. If you're listening to the podcast on your phone, simply open
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.600]  up the podcast and scroll like you're looking for new episodes and it will go right past
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.560]  the old episodes. Then it will give you ratings and reviews. Right at the top of that is a
[01:39.560 --> 01:43.820]  little window that says, write a review. Click right there. It will give you an opportunity
[01:43.820 --> 01:49.240]  to give me an amount of stars. Click on the amount of stars you feel I truly deserve.
[01:49.240 --> 01:52.840]  Then type in a review and let me know what you think of the show and I will read your
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.600]  review on a future episode.
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.840]  Now let's jump right into the most recent iTunes customer reviews. Today's first iTunes
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.920]  customer review comes from a listener who calls himself IryArmy619. Big shout out to
[02:06.920 --> 02:12.360]  the IryArmy. They left us a five star rating. The headline says, great show. Listen and
[02:12.360 --> 02:17.200]  learn everything you need or want to know about cannabis. Then the main review goes
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.280]  like this. Jeff is a very knowledgeable and humble grower. Well, thank you, first of all.
[02:22.280 --> 02:27.480]  Then he says, follow his guide and grow the best in your town. That is a great review.
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.960]  He said, I'm knowledgeable. He gives me some credibility there. Then he says, I'm humble,
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.480]  which makes him sound like a decent human. Then he recommends you follow the guide so
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.200]  that you can grow the best in your town. I could not have asked for a better review.
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.020]  Thanks for listening and thanks for the support, dude. I really do appreciate that five star
[02:42.020 --> 02:43.740]  review.
[02:43.740 --> 02:48.340]  Now our next iTunes customer review comes from a listener who calls themselves Eric
[02:48.340 --> 02:54.280]  at True North. Again, we got a five star rating and the review goes like this. I love the
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.980]  way Rasta Jeff combines humor and information to teach the listener about best grow techniques.
[02:59.980 --> 03:05.100]  He walks the fine line between take this seriously and don't be afraid to make mistakes. He also
[03:05.100 --> 03:10.880]  walks you through the details a new grower needs to know. He also conveys a ton of credibility.
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.340]  I trust he knows what he's talking about. I also have purchased from IRI Genetics and
[03:15.340 --> 03:20.360]  the product is world class. Keep it up. I feel like I may have read that review before,
[03:20.360 --> 03:24.460]  but that's worth reading again if I did read that on the show. Eric at True North, dude,
[03:24.460 --> 03:27.660]  thank you for the great review. I'm glad that you noticed a little bit of humor in there
[03:27.660 --> 03:31.200]  while I'm trying to teach and I'm glad that you're learning from me. I've said it before,
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.100]  but I was not a good student in school. I always want to learn, but I did not like being
[03:36.100 --> 03:41.140]  at school. So I try to educate in a way that I think can keep people's attention. So I
[03:41.140 --> 03:44.900]  try to put some jokes in there. I try to keep it entertaining and funny. Then you say I
[03:44.900 --> 03:49.580]  walk that fine line between take this seriously and don't be afraid to make mistakes. It's
[03:49.580 --> 03:53.740]  your garden. We're not doing brain surgery. We're not doing rocket science. We're growing
[03:53.740 --> 03:57.340]  some cannabis. So don't be afraid to make a few mistakes in the grow room. That's how
[03:57.340 --> 04:02.460]  you learn the most. You don't learn anything if things go smoothly every time. So do some
[04:02.460 --> 04:05.540]  experiments and challenge yourself. And I think that's how you learn the most.
[04:05.540 --> 04:09.620]  Now, you also say that I walk you through the details that a new grower needs to know.
[04:09.620 --> 04:13.540]  Yes, I want to get everybody up to speed. I know that not everybody has experience in
[04:13.540 --> 04:17.580]  a commercial environment. I want to grab everybody by the hand and walk them right through a
[04:17.580 --> 04:21.420]  grow and make sure they know what they're doing. The next thing you mentioned is that
[04:21.420 --> 04:25.940]  you know I have got credibility. Hey dude, thank you. I appreciate that. You say you
[04:25.940 --> 04:30.580]  trust that I know what I'm talking about. That means a lot to me. So thank you. Then
[04:30.580 --> 04:35.440]  you also say you have purchased from iRegenetics and the product is world-class. Man, I'm glad
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.080]  that the iRegenetics seeds worked for you and I'm glad that you found it world-class.
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.000]  So the last words were keep it up, Jeff. Dude, you know I will. Can't stop, won't stop. So
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.600]  hey, True North, thank you for the great review. Thank you for the five stars. I do appreciate
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.240]  it. And man, keep listening to the podcast and I will keep teaching you.
[04:53.240 --> 04:57.960]  All right, our next review comes from a person who calls themselves Mountain Man Drew. Mountain
[04:57.960 --> 05:04.200]  Man Drew left us a five-star review and the review goes like this. This is one of my favorite
[05:04.200 --> 05:10.120]  podcasts. Jeff keeps it cool and classy. I wish I could come hang out in the studio.
[05:10.120 --> 05:16.400]  By the way, some of my favorite episodes feature Mike. He seems like a cool dude. Hey, Mountain
[05:16.400 --> 05:19.880]  Man Drew, thanks for the five-star review. Thanks for saying that this is one of your
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.800]  favorite podcasts. I'm curious what your other favorites are. I'm glad you think I keep it
[05:24.800 --> 05:28.600]  cool and classy. I'm trying to be cool and classy. Dude, you can come hang out. If you're
[05:28.600 --> 05:31.560]  not crazy, if you're not a creep, if you're not a psycho, and if you don't smell like
[05:31.560 --> 05:35.720]  a pile of dog shit, you can come hang out, bro. Come kick it. It's not really a studio.
[05:35.720 --> 05:39.200]  It's my dining room. It's not as fancy as you think it's going to be, but bro, you're
[05:39.200 --> 05:40.600]  invited. Come hang out.
[05:40.600 --> 05:44.400]  Then the review goes on to say, by the way, some of my favorite episodes feature Mike.
[05:44.400 --> 05:48.640]  Hey dude, thank you for saying that because in a recent review, we had somebody bashing
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.080]  on Mike and saying they did not enjoy Mike on the podcast. I forgot to mention that that
[05:53.080 --> 05:58.000]  review no longer exists. If you scroll through my iTunes customer ratings and reviews, that
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.240]  review from Yolo Grower where he bashed Mike, it is gone. That was taken down. I had nothing
[06:03.240 --> 06:07.400]  to do with it. We are back to nothing but positivity in the ratings and reviews section.
[06:07.400 --> 06:12.160]  Hey Mike, I hope you heard that. Some of this guy's favorite episodes feature Mike and he
[06:12.160 --> 06:14.240]  says you seem like a cool dude.
[06:14.240 --> 06:17.720]  So Mountain Man Drew, thanks for shouting out the show. Thanks for shouting out Mike
[06:17.720 --> 06:23.080]  and thank you for listening and thank you for the great five-star review. I'm going
[06:23.080 --> 06:26.920]  to keep moving on with these customer reviews. We've got a couple more. This next one comes
[06:26.920 --> 06:32.440]  from a person who calls himself Smokin Art. Smokin Art left us a five-star rating. The
[06:32.440 --> 06:37.200]  headline of their review is, great show, and the review goes like this. This is a must
[06:37.200 --> 06:43.360]  for any new or old grower. I listen to every show at least once. So much good info. Keep
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.560]  up the great education.
[06:44.560 --> 06:49.720]  Hey Smokin Art, it sounds like I am hitting my target audience with you. You're listening
[06:49.720 --> 06:54.400]  to the shows multiple times and you're finding a lot of info and you are finding it educational.
[06:54.400 --> 06:58.120]  So perfect, man. Thank you. Thanks for listening and thanks for saying it's a must for new
[06:58.120 --> 07:03.040]  and old growers. That is my goal. So it feels good knowing I am hitting my goal.
[07:03.040 --> 07:09.680]  All right, our next review comes from a person who called themselves Ridge Monkey. The headline
[07:09.680 --> 07:16.760]  is GFYH equals dank. They left a five-star rating and the review goes like this. If you
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.360]  have a desire to learn about cannabis in more aspects than simply learning to grow, then
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.640]  this is a good podcast to start with. Although Rasta Jeff does focus most of the podcast
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.640]  time on the cultivation of cannabis, it still has savory nugs of the culture in general
[07:32.640 --> 07:38.320]  on the show. He is very thorough and has made me a believer in his capabilities to provide
[07:38.320 --> 07:44.640]  excellent quality, knowledge, and entertainment. His arise is fire. Mike occasionally comes
[07:44.640 --> 07:49.320]  on the show with some great information regarding the legal issues and also how to fight for
[07:49.320 --> 07:54.500]  your rights in the city council meetings. Much respect and much love to White Mike
[07:54.500 --> 07:57.320]  and Rasta Jeff for his amazing podcast.
[07:57.320 --> 08:00.840]  Hey, that is a great review. Thanks for all of that Ridge Monkey. There's a lot of great
[08:00.840 --> 08:05.680]  stuff in there. I do focus mostly on growing because I am a cultivator. I've got a lot
[08:05.680 --> 08:11.480]  of grow experience and I feel that that was what was lacking in the cannabis podcast area.
[08:11.480 --> 08:16.560]  We needed somebody to talk about growing. There are plenty of market reviews and politics
[08:16.560 --> 08:20.080]  stuff going on. There wasn't somebody out there talking about growing. So I wanted to
[08:20.080 --> 08:24.880]  fill that niche. I've got a lot of growing experience. I've got a lot of teaching experience.
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.160]  I felt like I would be a great person for that. So I do focus mostly on the cultivation
[08:30.160 --> 08:35.000]  part, but I'm glad you find that there are nuggets of our culture in there. And I also
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.480]  am glad that you appreciate Mike being on the show. I really love that you said that
[08:39.480 --> 08:44.440]  my arise is fire. And I also appreciate that you said I have made you a believer in my
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.100]  capabilities. That means a lot to me. So thanks for that support. And thanks for shouting
[08:49.100 --> 08:53.200]  out Mike and for my and shouting out myself. And thanks for all the love and respect. And
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.200]  also, thanks for saying the podcast is amazing. I do appreciate that. So big shout out to
[08:57.200 --> 09:00.840]  Ridge Monkey. Thanks for the great review and thanks for listening.
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.760]  You guys, there are more reviews. I'm going to keep going. The next one goes like this.
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.280]  The headline is genuine and informative. Again, we got a five-star rating. The review says
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.840]  Rasta Jeff is both honest and knowledgeable. He doesn't push sponsors and doesn't hate
[09:15.840 --> 09:20.760]  on others. You won't be let down by an episode. Every show has a genuine tone and you can
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.160]  feel the care and time that has gone into each production. Five stars is a perfect rating
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.400]  for this podcast in this genre. You'll learn something new every time.
[09:30.400 --> 09:33.840]  If that is a great review, I don't think I said your name because I think it's Taluna
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.120]  12 is how you say that. Big thanks for the great review, Taluna 12. You called me honest
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.360]  and knowledgeable. That means a lot to me. I don't push sponsors. There's no need for
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.480]  that. If there was a product that I really supported that wanted to sponsor the show,
[09:47.480 --> 09:50.760]  I would take it, but there's no need to have sponsors on here. This is just all for you
[09:50.760 --> 09:54.880]  guys to learn, not for me to get rich. Don't hate on others. Yeah, there's no need to do
[09:54.880 --> 09:58.920]  that. That's not going to get either one of us anywhere. You won't be let down by an episode.
[09:58.920 --> 10:01.900]  Thank you. And then you say that you can feel the care
[10:01.900 --> 10:05.700]  and time that goes into each production. Man, thank you because I do put a lot of energy
[10:05.700 --> 10:09.540]  and time into this. So I'm glad somebody notices. Thank you for mentioning that. And
[10:09.540 --> 10:13.620]  then five stars because you learn something every time. That means a lot to me. I'm glad
[10:13.620 --> 10:17.260]  you were learning something. That is exactly what I'm here for. So thanks for learning
[10:17.260 --> 10:22.540]  with me. Thanks for becoming a better grower. And also thanks for the great rating and review.
[10:22.540 --> 10:27.460]  All right, I've got another one for you. This one is headlined, Irie Army for the win. We've
[10:27.460 --> 10:34.580]  got five stars. This one is left by Ivyzilla. And the review goes like this. It occurs to
[10:34.580 --> 10:39.660]  me that I have heard every episode at least once, but I don't think I have ever left a
[10:39.660 --> 10:44.980]  review. So this is mine. Five stars all the way. I stumbled upon Rasta Jeff through an
[10:44.980 --> 10:50.100]  internet search for local suicide girls. That may be a weird way to find a cannabis podcast
[10:50.100 --> 10:53.780]  creator, but that's how it worked for me. I know how that worked out. I used to have
[10:53.780 --> 10:58.260]  some friends who were in the suicide girls group and we did a little thing together.
[10:58.260 --> 11:02.140]  There's a photo shoot and some cannabis things happening there. So I understand how that
[11:02.140 --> 11:05.340]  worked. I remember that. That was quite a while ago. The review goes on to say,
[11:05.340 --> 11:10.940]  I also enjoy listening to Jeff and his friends as they get lifted and talk about cannabis.
[11:10.940 --> 11:16.300]  I recently moved my family from Colorado to a state that is in the early days of medical use.
[11:16.300 --> 11:21.420]  I especially love the episodes that talk about standing up for the creation of new cannabis laws
[11:21.420 --> 11:27.340]  in your immediate area. I feel strongly that the entire country needs to have avenues for responsible
[11:27.340 --> 11:33.500]  adults to acquire cannabis legally and safely. We're starting a new year and while the political
[11:33.500 --> 11:38.380]  climate is unpleasant, it's definitely time for the ivory army to stand up and be heard.
[11:38.380 --> 11:43.340]  Safe cannabis for everyone. Thank you for the inspiration and happy new year from our friend,
[11:43.340 --> 11:47.660]  Tide Up. Hey Tide Up, thanks for the great review, bro. I know exactly who you are.
[11:47.660 --> 11:51.420]  We've hung out. We've had some fun together. You have been around for quite a while,
[11:51.420 --> 11:56.380]  so you are absolutely right. It is definitely time for you to leave a review. So thank you for that.
[11:56.380 --> 12:00.620]  Dude, thank you for all of the appreciation toward Mike. It is great to hear so much support
[12:00.620 --> 12:05.580]  for Mike. I'm glad you like listening to Mike and my friends and I hang out and get lifted.
[12:05.580 --> 12:09.260]  And dude, thank you for all of the ivory army support. I really appreciate that.
[12:09.260 --> 12:14.780]  It's an honor to have you as part of the ivory army. And bro, the next time you're in Colorado,
[12:14.780 --> 12:19.580]  let's get together and let's get elevated. All right, we've got more customer reviews to cover.
[12:19.580 --> 12:25.100]  The next one comes from a person who calls themselves Ogris Organic. The headline is,
[12:25.100 --> 12:30.940]  great edutainment. They left us a five-star review and the rating goes like this. I love
[12:30.940 --> 12:36.060]  this show. It has a great range of topics and covers each subject really well. I love having
[12:36.060 --> 12:41.740]  Mike on as he has helped me get ready for when my state finally goes legal to start growing my own
[12:41.740 --> 12:47.180]  happiness. Hey Ogris, thank you for the great review. We love having you as a listener. I'm
[12:47.180 --> 12:51.820]  glad you appreciate the range of topics. And again, I love hearing all of the support for Mike
[12:51.820 --> 12:56.380]  on the podcast. So big thanks and big shout out for the great review. We're going to keep going,
[12:56.380 --> 13:00.860]  you guys. We've only got two more, so let's get right through them. This one, the headline says,
[13:00.860 --> 13:06.700]  surprised you said no Thursday show. That's right. A couple episodes back, I said I probably would
[13:06.700 --> 13:10.460]  not put out a Thursday show. Mike ended up coming over and getting high and rambly,
[13:10.460 --> 13:14.940]  so we did put out a Thursday show. So you're welcome for the bonus content. I hope you
[13:14.940 --> 13:19.420]  enjoyed that. Also a huge shout out to Mike. Hey Mike, thank you for coming out and doing a long
[13:19.420 --> 13:23.820]  episode that night. I had a great time. Bro, you're invited back. Let's do more shows like
[13:23.820 --> 13:28.860]  that. It looks like the listeners really enjoyed it. So I'm going to continue with this episode,
[13:28.860 --> 13:33.660]  or with this review. It says, I liked all the info about how to behave when driving dirty,
[13:33.660 --> 13:38.700]  and I missed all but the last 15 minutes of your live show last night. So it was great to put a
[13:38.700 --> 13:44.460]  face to the all-knowing voice. Thanks for all you do in the cannabis cause. Hey bro, you're really
[13:44.460 --> 13:48.940]  welcome for all of what I do for the cannabis cause. Thanks for being a great listener. Thank
[13:48.940 --> 13:54.460]  you for the five-star rating, and thank you for the great review. This person mentioned he missed
[13:54.460 --> 14:00.060]  all but the last 15 minutes of my live show last night. He is referring to my Instagram live. I go
[14:00.060 --> 14:05.900]  on Instagram live, and I do hour-long rants where I just take a few dabs, and I answer cannabis
[14:05.900 --> 14:10.700]  questions. We hang out. Sometimes it's really serious. Sometimes it gets really goofy. Sometimes
[14:10.700 --> 14:14.780]  it's really funny. It is always a good time. So that's what he's talking about in there. Hey dude,
[14:14.860 --> 14:19.820]  thank you for hanging out in the Instagram live feeds, and thanks again for the great review.
[14:19.820 --> 14:25.340]  You guys, let's move into the last iTunes customer review of the episode. This one was left on
[14:25.340 --> 14:31.500]  January 9th of 2019. This one was left by a person who calls themselves, again, they're back at
[14:31.500 --> 14:41.900]  789-454-879-823123. That is a really long, very specific name. The headline of their review,
[14:41.900 --> 14:46.780]  again, is Full Melt Six Star Podcast. This person has left a review before. They're back. They have
[14:46.780 --> 14:53.100]  updated their review, and this time, the review goes like this. This podcast is iRee. Take a fat
[14:53.100 --> 14:59.340]  dab and give your mom this podcast. So this guy obviously listens to the end. Dude, thanks for
[14:59.340 --> 15:05.100]  the great review. Thanks for the five stars, and thanks for thinking that the podcast is iRee.
[15:05.100 --> 15:09.500]  I want to thank everybody again for leaving an iTunes customer review. If you're listening on
[15:09.500 --> 15:14.060]  an Apple device, if you've got an iPhone, an iPad, or even a MacBook, don't be shy, you guys.
[15:14.060 --> 15:19.020]  Please go leave a rating and review on the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. I would appreciate your
[15:19.020 --> 15:23.660]  support. All right, podcast world, I'm going to wrap up this quick Thursday episode. I want to
[15:23.660 --> 15:28.220]  thank you again for listening. I will be back Monday with a full-length episode. Don't forget
[15:28.220 --> 15:34.220]  that you can find me January 26th and 27th at the Indow Expo in Denver, Colorado. I will be at booth
[15:34.220 --> 15:39.980]  414. Come find me, come shake my hand, come take a picture, come get some iRee genetic seeds. I
[15:39.980 --> 15:44.620]  can't wait to meet you. All right, that's all I've got for you for this episode. I want to send a
[15:44.620 --> 15:49.900]  huge shout out to the CannaCrat. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
