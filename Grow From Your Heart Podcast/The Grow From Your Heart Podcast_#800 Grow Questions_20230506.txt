[00:03.200 --> 00:25.780]  Yeah, welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[00:25.780 --> 00:27.140]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:27.140 --> 00:31.120]  This is episode 800 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:31.120 --> 00:33.280]  Of course, I've got a fun show lined up for you.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.260]  In this episode, I'm going to give away free seeds.
[00:36.260 --> 00:37.260]  That's right.
[00:37.260 --> 00:42.100]  You can go to friendsatseedsherenow.com to give away free Irie Genetics seeds.
[00:42.100 --> 00:45.300]  We'll talk more about the free seed giveaway later in this episode.
[00:45.300 --> 00:50.660]  I do want to remind you that Team Irie Genetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup, June 3rd, just
[00:50.660 --> 00:52.860]  outside of Fort Collins, Colorado.
[00:52.860 --> 00:54.500]  Come say hi to Team Irie Genetics.
[00:54.500 --> 00:55.500]  I'll be there.
[00:55.500 --> 00:56.500]  I'll have Mike with me.
[00:56.500 --> 00:57.500]  Come say hi.
[00:57.500 --> 01:00.860]  Come give me a fist bump, shake my hand, take a selfie, grab some seeds if you need them.
[01:00.860 --> 01:03.540]  I cannot wait to meet you at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:03.540 --> 01:08.980]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all the links, deets, details, and ticket information.
[01:08.980 --> 01:15.520]  Also, I want to send a big shout out to everybody who supported the Irie Direct 420 sale.
[01:15.520 --> 01:16.520]  That sale was amazing.
[01:16.520 --> 01:17.520]  It was overwhelming.
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.140]  You guys did a great job on that sale.
[01:19.140 --> 01:20.680]  I appreciate it.
[01:20.680 --> 01:24.540]  Many of you may have noticed that for a moment, everything on Irie Direct was marked sold
[01:24.540 --> 01:25.540]  out.
[01:25.540 --> 01:29.460]  That was because I got so many sales on the 420 sale that I could not keep up.
[01:29.460 --> 01:32.700]  We had to mark everything sold out so that we could catch up and actually get the orders
[01:32.860 --> 01:34.420]  caught up and get to zero.
[01:34.420 --> 01:35.500]  We are doing an inventory.
[01:35.500 --> 01:36.500]  We are regrouping.
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.140]  We are rebuilding part of the website.
[01:38.140 --> 01:42.200]  I'm going to make sure that all the sold out stuff is removed and the in stock items are
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.200]  updated.
[01:43.200 --> 01:47.220]  Then I will send you a newsletter and we will do a fresh drop and a fresh restock here for
[01:47.220 --> 01:48.220]  the month of May.
[01:48.220 --> 01:51.900]  I've got a lot of great things ready to put out, a lot of great things planned for you.
[01:51.900 --> 01:55.780]  If you did notice that everything was out of sale on Irie Direct, have no fear.
[01:55.780 --> 02:01.100]  By the time this episode comes out, there will be plenty of new stock on the website.
[02:01.100 --> 02:05.180]  If you want to stay updated for those new updates, new drops, new restocks, make sure
[02:05.180 --> 02:09.660]  you join the Patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:09.660 --> 02:12.620]  Everyone on Patreon does get the first heads up on drops.
[02:12.620 --> 02:18.180]  And then of course there is the newsletter on the website at iregenetics.com.
[02:18.180 --> 02:21.060]  You guys, let's get excited because this is episode number 800.
[02:21.060 --> 02:25.580]  I cannot believe that I have done 800 episodes of this podcast.
[02:25.580 --> 02:28.340]  Big shout out to everybody who's ever been on the show.
[02:28.340 --> 02:30.060]  I've had a lot of great guests in the past.
[02:30.060 --> 02:34.020]  Of course, Mike has been the most dominant, most prominent guest on the show.
[02:34.020 --> 02:38.020]  Big shout out to my buddy, White Mike for joining the podcast and being on the show.
[02:38.020 --> 02:42.460]  Big shout out to Maddie and Spence and Sean and Jesse and everybody who's been on the
[02:42.460 --> 02:43.460]  show.
[02:43.460 --> 02:46.120]  There's so many people that if I try to work through the list, I will miss some people.
[02:46.120 --> 02:48.260]  We had Addison DeMora on the show.
[02:48.260 --> 02:50.900]  We've had John Hunt and the Terpy Boys on the show.
[02:50.900 --> 02:53.540]  We've had a bunch of great people here on the podcast.
[02:53.540 --> 02:55.880]  Big shout out to everybody who's been on the show.
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.100]  Big shout out to everybody who has sponsored the show.
[02:58.100 --> 03:02.700]  A lot of people and companies out there have sent financial contributions to the podcast
[03:02.700 --> 03:07.940]  and many companies and brands have sent products for me to use, abuse, review and enjoy here
[03:07.940 --> 03:10.740]  on the show or just in my normal dabbing life.
[03:10.740 --> 03:13.900]  Lots of dab equipment, dab nails from Highly Educated.
[03:13.900 --> 03:16.320]  Big shout out to Highly Educated, one of my first sponsors.
[03:16.320 --> 03:20.420]  Also shout out to Oil Slick, Handmade Apparel, some of the folks that have been sponsors
[03:20.420 --> 03:22.060]  since the beginning.
[03:22.060 --> 03:24.340]  Big shout out to all the people that have been on the podcast.
[03:24.340 --> 03:25.340]  Thank you.
[03:25.340 --> 03:26.340]  Thanks to everybody that has sponsored the show.
[03:26.460 --> 03:31.380]  Most importantly, you guys, thanks to everybody who listens to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:31.380 --> 03:32.380]  I appreciate it.
[03:32.380 --> 03:35.540]  If you're a new listener, if you're a long-time listener, thank you.
[03:35.540 --> 03:37.740]  I appreciate all of the clicks, all of the listens.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.780]  I appreciate the interaction.
[03:39.780 --> 03:40.780]  Thank you.
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.900]  Without you guys, this would be a mental problem.
[03:42.900 --> 03:46.020]  It would just be me talking to a camera for no reason.
[03:46.020 --> 03:47.020]  Thank you for listening.
[03:47.020 --> 03:48.140]  Thank you for watching.
[03:48.140 --> 03:49.220]  Thank you for subscribing.
[03:49.220 --> 03:50.220]  I appreciate it.
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.420]  With that being said, let's keep rocking, bro.
[03:52.420 --> 03:53.620]  There's no reason to stop the show.
[03:53.620 --> 03:55.900]  You guys keep sending amazing questions.
[03:56.460 --> 03:57.460]  Cannabis keeps evolving.
[03:57.460 --> 04:00.380]  There are more states and more people growing every single day.
[04:00.380 --> 04:04.740]  So I'm going to stay here and keep rocking this cannabis podcast to make you guys the
[04:04.740 --> 04:07.740]  best growers that we can all possibly be together.
[04:07.740 --> 04:10.200]  So thank you guys for 800 episodes of support.
[04:10.200 --> 04:11.200]  That's fucking tremendous.
[04:11.200 --> 04:12.380]  I appreciate it.
[04:12.380 --> 04:16.580]  Now, let's move off of the ramblings and business part of the podcast.
[04:16.580 --> 04:18.620]  Let's jump into some grow topics.
[04:18.620 --> 04:22.900]  I was talking to a friend earlier today, and we're talking about just rebuilding grow rooms
[04:22.900 --> 04:25.660]  and redesigning spaces and ideas and goals.
[04:25.660 --> 04:31.060]  And then every time we talk about adding more shit to a grow, my brain says, keep it simple
[04:31.060 --> 04:32.060]  stoner.
[04:32.060 --> 04:36.940]  The more shit in that room, the more operating pieces you've got, the more shit can go wrong.
[04:36.940 --> 04:39.100]  I work in commercial facilities.
[04:39.100 --> 04:41.260]  I train people to work in commercial facilities.
[04:41.260 --> 04:45.500]  When we have a new hire, the first thing I tell them, so I have them meet me at the door
[04:45.500 --> 04:47.100]  to the facility on day one.
[04:47.100 --> 04:48.100]  I unlock the door.
[04:48.100 --> 04:49.100]  We walk in together.
[04:49.100 --> 04:50.100]  We clock in together.
[04:50.100 --> 04:52.000]  I teach this person how to run the grow.
[04:52.100 --> 04:53.360]  They walk in right with me.
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.840]  Before we walk into the grow on the very first day, I tell them the first thing we are going
[04:57.840 --> 05:01.980]  to look for today is to find out what broke last night.
[05:01.980 --> 05:06.560]  And I know that sounds very, not very optimistic, but when you run a commercial facility with
[05:06.560 --> 05:11.360]  somewhere between two and 500 lights, or maybe even more in some cases, there are a lot of
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.800]  lights, a lot of fans, a lot of pumps, a lot of random equipment, humidifiers, dehumidifiers,
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.480]  cameras, sensors, detectors, emitters.
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.880]  There's a ton of shit that can go wrong.
[05:21.880 --> 05:23.180]  And guess what?
[05:23.180 --> 05:24.280]  Something is going to go wrong.
[05:24.280 --> 05:28.180]  No matter how much maintenance you do, no matter how much care and upkeep you give,
[05:28.180 --> 05:31.240]  these are constantly moving pieces in a commercial facility.
[05:31.240 --> 05:32.520]  Something will go wrong.
[05:32.520 --> 05:36.600]  The first thing you need to do when you go in, I teach is go look for the shit that broke.
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.980]  So my theory is the less moving parts you have in a personal grow, the less shit you've
[05:40.980 --> 05:41.980]  got to break.
[05:41.980 --> 05:44.280]  So kind of keep it simple stoner.
[05:44.280 --> 05:48.360]  Another thing that reminds me of and brings me to is when I started growing, we did not
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.240]  have all these monitors and devices and technology and toys.
[05:52.240 --> 05:53.960]  I had to learn the plants.
[05:53.960 --> 05:56.440]  The plants are what was telling me I'm over watered.
[05:56.440 --> 05:57.440]  I'm underwater.
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.440]  It's too hot in here.
[05:58.440 --> 05:59.680]  It's too cold in here.
[05:59.680 --> 06:01.000]  You've given me too much nitrogen.
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.920]  You haven't given me enough nitrogen.
[06:02.920 --> 06:06.440]  The plants are what I have learned as my monitors, my meters.
[06:06.440 --> 06:09.000]  I don't use a bunch of technical stuff in my grow space.
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  I have a pH pen.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.320]  I have an EC meter.
[06:11.320 --> 06:14.640]  I've got monitors to tell me what the temperature and humidity are in there, but I don't really
[06:14.640 --> 06:18.440]  use a lot of super overly complicated technical shit.
[06:18.440 --> 06:21.920]  If I need to know if it's too hot or too cold in my grow, I look at the thermometer.
[06:21.920 --> 06:25.360]  If I need to know if the humidity is too high or too low, I look at the hygrometer.
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.520]  Those are two really easy pieces of equipment to read that tell me what my room is sitting
[06:29.520 --> 06:30.520]  at.
[06:30.520 --> 06:32.780]  The temperature and humidity, those are two of the most important things.
[06:32.780 --> 06:34.440]  If those are cool, then I look at the plants.
[06:34.440 --> 06:37.560]  If the plants look like this and they're green, nothing to fuck with.
[06:37.560 --> 06:41.040]  If they're yellow, if they're going sideways, if the leaves are twisting, there's something
[06:41.040 --> 06:42.040]  to deal with.
[06:42.040 --> 06:43.040]  And guess what?
[06:43.040 --> 06:45.120]  The leaves are telling me exactly what the problem is.
[06:45.120 --> 06:47.200]  I look at the leaf, I go, it's kind of yellow in the middle.
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.200]  It needs some nitrogen.
[06:48.200 --> 06:50.720]  Or I look at the leaf and I go, oh, it's getting crispy at the tips.
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.160]  I'm feeding it a little bit too much.
[06:52.160 --> 06:54.080]  I can identify all of those problems.
[06:54.080 --> 06:57.760]  So what I'm kind of getting at is you guys don't rely on so much of that equipment.
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.360]  Keep it simple, stoner.
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.360]  Learn the plants.
[07:00.360 --> 07:02.400]  Learn how to identify what the plants are telling you.
[07:02.400 --> 07:05.240]  Learn how to identify it early and how to react to it.
[07:05.240 --> 07:08.320]  If you see this, how do you respond to it to correct that?
[07:08.320 --> 07:12.600]  Because another thing, once you identify the problem, how are you going to correct it?
[07:12.600 --> 07:17.560]  Many new growers see a very small problem and they turn it into a big problem by trying
[07:17.560 --> 07:19.760]  to overcorrect that problem.
[07:19.760 --> 07:22.960]  They say, oh, I need a little bit of cow mag, but I read that when you give cow mag, you
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.880]  need to give phosphorus or potassium.
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.760]  Or also maybe I should add some of this.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.500]  And they just get these bright ideas.
[07:28.500 --> 07:30.440]  What if I put this in there also?
[07:30.440 --> 07:31.440]  Guess what?
[07:31.440 --> 07:32.440]  You had a cow mag deficiency.
[07:32.440 --> 07:34.120]  Just add a little bit of cow mag.
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.320]  It was probably calcium and not magnesium, but they're sold in the same bottle.
[07:37.320 --> 07:38.660]  So you see what I'm saying?
[07:38.660 --> 07:42.000]  You see that little bit of a problem and you want to fix 12 different problems or throw
[07:42.400 --> 07:45.040]  12 different things at it and then you throw everything out of whack.
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.120]  Just carefully fix that one problem.
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.300]  What I'm rambling about is you guys learn the plants, keep it simple, Stoner.
[07:51.300 --> 07:56.000]  Don't rely too much on monitors, equipment, gear, toys, tools, and technology.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.840]  When we've been doing this for hundreds of years, growing plants without all that shit,
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.480]  we've just been looking at them and going, hey Bill, this plant's yellow.
[08:02.480 --> 08:03.480]  What should we do?
[08:03.480 --> 08:04.480]  Give it more nitrogen.
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.480]  Perfect.
[08:05.480 --> 08:07.080]  It's been that simple for that long.
[08:07.080 --> 08:09.160]  So let's learn these plants.
[08:09.160 --> 08:12.240]  There are plenty of charts on the internet that will tell you if your leaves look like
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.480]  this, here is the problem.
[08:13.480 --> 08:15.860]  If your leaf looks like this, here is the problem.
[08:15.860 --> 08:19.640]  Those charts are quite accurate if you learn how to read them and become very discerning
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.820]  because of course a couple of them look similar and can be confusing, but really pay attention
[08:23.820 --> 08:28.560]  to the details and pay attention to what you fed also and you'll know, did I give it too
[08:28.560 --> 08:29.560]  much nitrogen?
[08:29.560 --> 08:30.840]  Did I not give it enough phosphorus?
[08:30.840 --> 08:35.100]  You'll be able to tell based on what the leaves are doing and what you have fed that plant.
[08:35.100 --> 08:38.680]  So that's how I wrap up that section where I call it, keep it simple, Stoner.
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.480]  Let's not focus so much on the toys and the technology, but let's learn how to pay attention
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.880]  to the plants because after all, the plants are the boss in our grow rooms.
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.480]  All right, now let's segue into everybody's favorite part of this podcast.
[08:50.480 --> 08:53.520]  Let's get into the email portion of today's podcast.
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.920]  I've got a stack of questions here in front of me.
[08:55.920 --> 09:02.080]  This first question did come from the grow help submission tab on iRegenetics.com.
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.200]  If you have a grow help question, go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[09:06.200 --> 09:07.560]  There's a row of tabs at the top.
[09:07.560 --> 09:10.080]  One of them says grow help or grow questions.
[09:10.080 --> 09:11.080]  Click on that tab.
[09:11.080 --> 09:13.600]  We'll give you the opportunity to fill out a little questionnaire.
[09:13.600 --> 09:15.920]  Then you get to tell us what's wrong with your plants.
[09:15.920 --> 09:19.960]  If I select your question and read it here on the podcast, guess what?
[09:19.960 --> 09:21.960]  You win a free pack of seeds.
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.080]  So this message came from my friend Chivo Del Norte.
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.080]  Big shout out to Chivo.
[09:26.080 --> 09:28.640]  You have won a free pack of iRegenetic seeds.
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.720]  Please send me an email with your shipping address and also include a real name that
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.080]  I can put on the box for those seeds because I have to hand deliver these packages to the
[09:37.080 --> 09:41.400]  post office and when they see weird random names, they look at me kind of funny and I
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.400]  don't want any problems.
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.240]  So let's put a real name on the package, please.
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.320]  You guys, this grow question goes just like this.
[09:47.320 --> 09:48.760]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff.
[09:48.760 --> 09:49.760]  What's up, bro?
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.760]  Good to meet you.
[09:50.760 --> 09:51.760]  I think I've met you before online.
[09:51.760 --> 09:52.760]  Thanks for the great message.
[09:52.760 --> 09:53.760]  It goes like this.
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.080]  First of all, I want to say that I really appreciate you and what you do for the community
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.200]  and that you bless us all with your knowledge and passion.
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.200]  Much respect.
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.960]  Bro, it's comments like that that recharge me, that keep me going, that make it all worth
[10:05.960 --> 10:06.960]  it.
[10:06.960 --> 10:09.920]  Knowing that I'm helping at least you because I'm answering your question, but knowing that
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.680]  I'm helping people, making gardens better, making cannabis better as a whole, that means
[10:14.680 --> 10:15.680]  a lot to me.
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.040]  And the reminders like this, those recharge me and those keep me going.
[10:19.040 --> 10:20.040]  So thank you, bro.
[10:20.040 --> 10:21.120]  I do appreciate that.
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.600]  Much respect back at you as well.
[10:22.600 --> 10:23.600]  Big fist bump.
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.760]  Now it says, my question is in the area of white hairs, those are called pistils, my
[10:28.760 --> 10:29.760]  friend.
[10:29.760 --> 10:30.760]  Those are the reproductive organ of the plant.
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.960]  It says, is there a way to tell from the hairs that the plant has been pollinated?
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.680]  I know some cultivars do produce red hairs, so I was wondering how I can tell the difference.
[10:39.680 --> 10:42.640]  Thanks again for your time and passion and aloha.
[10:42.640 --> 10:43.680]  Big aloha, my brother.
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.200]  Thank you for the great question.
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.240]  Let's talk about these pistils.
[10:47.240 --> 10:53.920]  About 14 to 21 to 28 to 32-ish days into flower, your plant is going to be showing pistils.
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.400]  Those are the dandelion looking or the cluster of those pistils looks like a dandelion forming
[10:58.400 --> 10:59.400]  on your ganja plant.
[10:59.400 --> 11:00.920]  That is the start of flower.
[11:00.920 --> 11:04.280]  Those little pistils are the reproductive part of the cannabis plant.
[11:04.320 --> 11:06.320]  That's the number one goal.
[11:06.320 --> 11:08.160]  We think it's to get us high.
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.160]  That's the bonus.
[11:09.160 --> 11:10.160]  That's the side effect.
[11:10.160 --> 11:12.920]  But the number one goal of the cannabis plant is to reproduce.
[11:12.920 --> 11:17.920]  It wants to make more plants to continue its life next year and then continue next year.
[11:17.920 --> 11:20.320]  So cannabis's number one goal is to reproduce.
[11:20.320 --> 11:23.820]  And those white hairs are the reproductive organ on the plant.
[11:23.820 --> 11:25.360]  Those hairs stick out.
[11:25.360 --> 11:27.880]  The male plants grow a little bit taller than the females.
[11:27.880 --> 11:29.360]  Hopefully, they drop pollen.
[11:29.360 --> 11:31.520]  That pollen lands on that hair.
[11:31.520 --> 11:35.360]  That pistil slides down that pistil into the ovule where a seed is formed.
[11:35.360 --> 11:38.640]  There's a bract involved in there, but we're just going to stick with the ovule into the
[11:38.640 --> 11:39.640]  bract.
[11:39.640 --> 11:40.640]  A seed is formed.
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.640]  That's where the seeds will happen.
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.880]  Now, the question is how can I tell if the plant has been pollinated by looking at the
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.880]  pistils?
[11:46.880 --> 11:48.040]  That's a really good question.
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.280]  Once the plant is pollinated, so we'll say the pistils are sticking up like my fingers
[11:52.280 --> 11:54.240]  like I'm giving you a high five.
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.260]  Shortly after pollination, they'll turn kind of a brown color and start to crumple inside
[11:59.260 --> 12:02.140]  on themselves and just dry up and wither away.
[12:02.140 --> 12:04.100]  That's how to identify that they have been pollinated.
[12:04.100 --> 12:09.820]  Now, it is true that a lot of plants do produce red hairs, but that is later in flower.
[12:09.820 --> 12:14.300]  Once those hairs have turned red, that plant is basically past its prime point for pollination
[12:14.300 --> 12:15.980]  and it can no longer receive pollen.
[12:15.980 --> 12:20.180]  Its lady parts are dried up basically, and it can no longer reproduce.
[12:20.180 --> 12:24.420]  Now most of the time, I can tell the difference between a dried up pistil that has been pollinated
[12:24.420 --> 12:28.120]  and a plant that has gone beyond its time just by kind of looking at the plant.
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.680]  First of all, there will be a seed.
[12:29.680 --> 12:32.320]  If it's been pollinated, it will start forming a seed.
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.840]  I won't take very long from pollination for the seeds to start forming.
[12:35.840 --> 12:37.880]  You'll see seeds in seven to 10 days.
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.800]  They won't be chunky, fat, healthy seeds, but you'll be able to identify that that plant
[12:41.800 --> 12:44.800]  has been pollinated by the formation of seeds.
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.160]  Now when they get pollinated, they kind of curl in and shrivel a little bit differently.
[12:49.160 --> 12:52.820]  If they go un-pollinated and they're left just to die on their own and wither away,
[12:52.820 --> 12:56.880]  they kind of just die and stay not withered and curled in, but a little bit straighter.
[12:56.880 --> 13:00.320]  They do have curls and textures to them, but they don't curl as badly.
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.600]  I keep saying the word curl.
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.200]  Maybe that's exactly what to look for when it like claws up a little bit.
[13:05.200 --> 13:07.920]  When the pistils, they just fold in on each other.
[13:07.920 --> 13:09.040]  That's when they have been pollinated.
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.280]  If they're still kind of long and wispy like eyelashes, then they're probably not pollinated.
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.280]  But the number one indicator obviously is going to be the presence of a seed in that
[13:17.280 --> 13:18.280]  plant.
[13:18.280 --> 13:19.920]  Now a lot of people are going to freak out.
[13:19.920 --> 13:22.200]  A lot of times people send me messages.
[13:22.200 --> 13:23.240]  They say, hey bro, what do I do?
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.200]  My plants are filled with seeds.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.840]  And then I say, let's investigate more.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.200]  Send me a picture, send me a video.
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.620]  Let's do some tricks.
[13:29.620 --> 13:30.920]  We go squeezing around on the plant.
[13:30.920 --> 13:33.760]  We go looking around and we realize those are not seeds.
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.320]  Those are swollen bracts, which is what we want.
[13:36.320 --> 13:39.440]  We want the plant to get swollen calyxes, big fat bracts.
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.000]  Those are the parts that we're going to smoke.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.160]  That's going to be the flower.
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.240]  That is the flower cluster forming.
[13:44.240 --> 13:47.120]  Every one of those little clusters makes a big flower.
[13:47.120 --> 13:48.640]  So we want that to happen.
[13:48.640 --> 13:49.800]  A lot of people freak out.
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.300]  They see at the nodes, right where the leaf, the big petiole comes out.
[13:53.300 --> 13:55.600]  Sometimes there's a little bract right at the bottom of there.
[13:55.600 --> 13:57.440]  People really freak out and say, I've got seeds.
[13:57.440 --> 13:58.440]  Guess what?
[13:58.440 --> 13:59.440]  That's just a bract.
[13:59.440 --> 14:00.560]  You probably don't have seeds.
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.880]  So look at the plants and you can tell if they're big and white and fluffy, those are
[14:04.880 --> 14:07.080]  ready for pollen and have not been pollinated.
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.160]  If they get brown and curl in a little bit like a cat claw, I guess, or like the, like
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.200]  the, yeah, it's a cat claw I'm making right there, bro.
[14:13.200 --> 14:14.200]  That's what that is.
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.040]  They curl in like a girl on Instagram trying to show you her fingernails.
[14:17.040 --> 14:19.160]  If they curl in like that, that makes sense, right?
[14:19.160 --> 14:20.800]  Then it's probably been pollinated.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.240]  If they just die and lay across the bud like that and they don't curl in like the cat claw,
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.400]  then they're probably just expired pistols is what I would call them at that point.
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.600]  I just made that phrase up, expired pistols.
[14:30.600 --> 14:32.240]  I don't know if that's even real.
[14:32.240 --> 14:35.420]  You heard it first here on the Grow From Your Heart podcast, episode 800, we're making up
[14:35.420 --> 14:36.800]  new fucking words.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.800]  Have fun with me.
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.680]  Um, so I think I basically covered that.
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.320]  I know some cultivars, cultivars produce red hairs.
[14:43.320 --> 14:44.640]  That's going to be later in flower.
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.160]  So, um, you'll know you'll, you'll probably, you should probably be able to tell the difference
[14:49.160 --> 14:52.280]  if you don't see any seeds or anything, then it has not been pollinated.
[14:52.280 --> 14:53.820]  So just go ahead and give it a squeeze.
[14:53.820 --> 14:56.100]  Don't go destroying your buds, but give it a squeeze.
[14:56.100 --> 15:00.780]  If there's a seed in there, it'll pop like a pea or it'll have some juices inside of
[15:00.780 --> 15:01.780]  it.
[15:01.780 --> 15:05.580]  And if there's not a seed, there won't be anything inside of those bracts or calyxes.
[15:05.580 --> 15:08.100]  All right, my buddy Chivo, thank you for the great message.
[15:08.100 --> 15:11.460]  I do owe you a free pack of Irie genetic seeds.
[15:11.460 --> 15:14.140]  Once again, please do send me your shipping info.
[15:14.140 --> 15:15.900]  I'll get those out to you right away.
[15:15.900 --> 15:19.340]  If I do owe you seeds as a prize, cause I've read your message here on the show and I have
[15:19.340 --> 15:21.420]  not sent it, please be patient with me.
[15:21.420 --> 15:23.660]  I was overwhelmed with the 420 sale.
[15:23.700 --> 15:25.020]  I've just caught up with all of that.
[15:25.020 --> 15:27.860]  I've got a lot of stuff going on, but I will get your prizes out.
[15:27.860 --> 15:29.400]  Have no fear.
[15:29.400 --> 15:31.160]  Everybody does get their prizes.
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.500]  Sometimes it just takes a little bit of time.
[15:32.500 --> 15:37.100]  All right, we're going to move into the next question here on today's podcast.
[15:37.100 --> 15:40.860]  This one came from our friend Kronkor, is how I think I would say that.
[15:40.860 --> 15:41.860]  K-R-O-N-K-O-R.
[15:41.860 --> 15:42.860]  That's Kronkor.
[15:42.860 --> 15:45.700]  That's what I'm calling you from now on, bro.
[15:45.700 --> 15:46.860]  I hope that's how I say it.
[15:46.860 --> 15:51.180]  So this message says, yo Rasta Jeff, I love your show and I've been watching since at
[15:51.180 --> 15:53.860]  least 2018.
[15:53.860 --> 15:54.860]  That's a lot of episodes, bro.
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.280]  Thank you for watching.
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.900]  Also kind of embarrassing because I wasn't a super good podcaster back then, but thank
[15:59.900 --> 16:01.220]  you for growing with me.
[16:01.220 --> 16:03.500]  I hope you noticed the growth and improvements in the podcast.
[16:03.500 --> 16:05.300]  I hope you're watching the video as well.
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.500]  Uh, then it goes on.
[16:06.500 --> 16:10.340]  It says, thank you for all of the wonderful information you put into your podcast.
[16:10.340 --> 16:11.700]  I have learned a lot.
[16:11.700 --> 16:15.020]  Like I said before, bro, that is the kind of feedback and encouragement that I need
[16:15.020 --> 16:17.020]  to keep me inspired to do the shows.
[16:17.020 --> 16:18.020]  So thank you.
[16:18.020 --> 16:20.060]  It says now onto my reason for writing.
[16:20.060 --> 16:24.700]  I have a few potential questions for you to maybe answer on your podcast.
[16:24.700 --> 16:25.700]  Have no fear, my dude.
[16:25.700 --> 16:28.860]  I'm going to answer your questions right here on the show.
[16:28.860 --> 16:29.860]  This is a quick one.
[16:29.860 --> 16:33.860]  It says, I've been wondering if you know if there are any benefits to watering cannabis
[16:33.860 --> 16:40.100]  plants with coffee leftover from our morning, maybe not every morning, but sometimes.
[16:40.100 --> 16:43.620]  My quick answer to that is the, uh, the pH is way too acidic.
[16:43.620 --> 16:48.620]  I wouldn't do it because, uh, we try to stay in a Pacific, a specific pH range.
[16:48.620 --> 16:51.460]  And I'm certain that coffee is going to be very acidic.
[16:51.460 --> 16:54.780]  First of all, when I drink coffee, if it tastes very acidic to me, I'm not even a huge coffee
[16:54.780 --> 16:55.780]  fan anymore.
[16:55.780 --> 16:57.180]  Uh, but it's too acidic.
[16:57.180 --> 16:59.220]  That's going to be my, that's the short answer.
[16:59.220 --> 17:04.500]  Now it says, uh, keeping with the coffee questions, what about top dressing with coffee grounds?
[17:04.500 --> 17:05.500]  Again?
[17:05.500 --> 17:06.500]  Uh, no.
[17:06.500 --> 17:07.500]  Now my short answer was no.
[17:07.500 --> 17:11.780]  Then it says for these, for any of these questions, does it matter if we use a coffee beans, if
[17:11.780 --> 17:14.580]  the coffee beans are caffeinated or not?
[17:14.580 --> 17:16.100]  Thank you from your friend Kronker.
[17:16.700 --> 17:19.660]  The final note that I wrote on this paper was just drink the coffee.
[17:19.660 --> 17:21.100]  It sounds like you really enjoy coffee.
[17:21.100 --> 17:23.380]  It sounds like you really enjoy cannabis.
[17:23.380 --> 17:27.220]  Let's just roll up a fat joint of cannabis and have a nice fat cup of coffee and enjoy
[17:27.220 --> 17:28.220]  them that way.
[17:28.220 --> 17:29.940]  Um, I don't see the benefits.
[17:29.940 --> 17:33.980]  I think you'll probably cause more harm than you will benefit if you try to induce the
[17:33.980 --> 17:35.500]  coffee into the cannabis.
[17:35.500 --> 17:37.060]  Um, it's a really good idea.
[17:37.060 --> 17:40.700]  I understand you want to be a useful, you've got these coffee grounds, you've got some
[17:40.700 --> 17:41.940]  waste, you want to use it.
[17:41.940 --> 17:46.300]  If you really want to do it, I recommend putting it into the compost bin, compost it,
[17:46.300 --> 17:51.220]  but otherwise you're just going to totally disrupt the pH of your rhizosphere for your
[17:51.220 --> 17:52.220]  cannabis plants.
[17:52.220 --> 17:54.340]  My dude Kronker, thank you for the great message.
[17:54.340 --> 17:59.660]  Once again, send me your address so that I can send you a pack of Irie Genetics seeds.
[17:59.660 --> 18:04.220]  Of course, that seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[18:04.220 --> 18:09.860]  Make sure you check out seedsherenow.com for regular feminized photo period auto flower,
[18:09.860 --> 18:11.220]  any seeds you could imagine.
[18:11.220 --> 18:13.980]  They are available at seedsherenow.com.
[18:13.980 --> 18:14.980]  Go check them out.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.140]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[18:16.140 --> 18:18.700]  All right, we've got another question right here in front of me.
[18:18.700 --> 18:21.540]  This one came from our friend Fridge Raider.
[18:21.540 --> 18:26.020]  Bro, you're telling me bro, smoke a few dabs and go raid the fridge.
[18:26.020 --> 18:27.260]  That is a great name.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.900]  This is a general grow question.
[18:28.900 --> 18:33.140]  It says Rasta Jeff, I'm very excited and happy to have your gear.
[18:33.140 --> 18:35.100]  I'm glad you're able to get your hands on my gear brother.
[18:35.100 --> 18:38.220]  It says I've been listening to the podcast for at least a year now.
[18:38.860 --> 18:41.020]  I picked up a few packs from you recently.
[18:41.020 --> 18:43.500]  I got Nuketown, very great strain.
[18:43.500 --> 18:46.620]  Nuketown is Chernobyl to a Golden Goat.
[18:46.620 --> 18:50.340]  It says I got Chemical Cocktail, which is Lemon Chem to Afterglow.
[18:50.340 --> 18:56.260]  And we've got the Maze, which is Blue Raspberry Truffle to the reversed Afterglow once again.
[18:56.260 --> 19:00.060]  So a great lineup of strains there, Nuketown, Chemical Cocktail and the Maze.
[19:00.060 --> 19:01.140]  It says I'm very excited.
[19:01.140 --> 19:01.820]  Bro, I would be too.
[19:01.820 --> 19:03.100]  That's a good run.
[19:03.100 --> 19:06.220]  And also, very good strain selections.
[19:06.220 --> 19:10.580]  The Chemical Cocktail and the Maze will run beautifully together and they're going to
[19:10.580 --> 19:14.780]  have very different effects and flavors and aromas.
[19:14.780 --> 19:15.740]  So that's great.
[19:15.740 --> 19:18.780]  The Nuketown will go well in there, but it's going to be a little bit shorter than the
[19:18.780 --> 19:20.260]  other plants.
[19:20.260 --> 19:23.100]  So if you're going to run those together, I do the Chemical Cocktail and the Maze and
[19:23.100 --> 19:25.620]  then consider the Nuketown on a different run.
[19:25.620 --> 19:26.140]  Do your thing.
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.780]  If you're going to run them all together, it will work.
[19:27.780 --> 19:33.140]  But the Nuketown is going to grow a little bit differently, more bushy, less tall than
[19:33.140 --> 19:34.340]  the other plants in the room.
[19:34.340 --> 19:35.660]  I'm sure you can manage it.
[19:35.660 --> 19:36.260]  It goes on though.
[19:36.260 --> 19:37.820]  It says I'm very excited.
[19:37.820 --> 19:40.500]  I would like to preserve genetics by cloning.
[19:40.500 --> 19:44.940]  The issue is I've never cloned anything before and I've been through a few runs.
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.300]  All right.
[19:45.300 --> 19:46.460]  Now it's time to learn how to clone.
[19:46.460 --> 19:47.500]  Bro, that's a great step.
[19:47.500 --> 19:52.100]  Unfortunately, I put out a wonderful cloning podcast.
[19:52.100 --> 19:52.620]  It was great.
[19:52.620 --> 19:55.380]  In my opinion, it was a wonderful show.
[19:55.380 --> 20:00.300]  YouTube didn't seem to think so because after it got about 2,000 views in just a few days,
[20:00.300 --> 20:02.060]  YouTube took the video down.
[20:02.100 --> 20:07.620]  My How to Cut Clones and Cultivate Clones episode with a step-by-step video, I was clipping
[20:07.620 --> 20:10.020]  them, dipping them, and sticking them and getting them going.
[20:10.020 --> 20:11.020]  YouTube took it down.
[20:11.020 --> 20:13.300]  So I can't refer you to my clone cutting video.
[20:13.300 --> 20:17.180]  I hope and I'm sure there are several other clone cutting videos out there on YouTube.
[20:17.180 --> 20:21.260]  I recommend watching a good video, getting a good education on cloning.
[20:21.260 --> 20:22.500]  But I'm sad they took mine down.
[20:22.500 --> 20:23.100]  I digress.
[20:23.100 --> 20:24.020]  Let's keep moving here.
[20:24.020 --> 20:29.980]  It says, how would you recommend one to clone without using a store-bought tray and dome?
[20:30.020 --> 20:32.540]  What do you think about putting clones into tap water to root?
[20:32.540 --> 20:37.420]  No, these plants are too high performance, too valuable, too precious, and we expect
[20:37.420 --> 20:40.860]  too much out of them to just drop them into water and expect them to root.
[20:40.860 --> 20:43.620]  They may, some of your healthier plants may root.
[20:43.620 --> 20:46.900]  Most of them are just going to shrivel up and get rotten and die without some sort of
[20:46.900 --> 20:48.860]  movement, without some air in there.
[20:48.860 --> 20:51.260]  They want more than that and they deserve more than that.
[20:51.260 --> 20:57.740]  They also say, also, what about putting cuttings into reused soil to root using cups?
[20:57.740 --> 20:58.740]  So I understand what you're saying.
[20:58.740 --> 21:02.540]  You want to use a beer cup, like a solo cup with holes in the bottom for drainage, then
[21:02.540 --> 21:05.620]  use a clear cup up top to work as a humidity dome.
[21:05.620 --> 21:11.220]  So far, out of all of your ideas, that is the best one that I think I would go with.
[21:11.220 --> 21:15.100]  You say that the store-bought domes and trays and everything are expensive.
[21:15.100 --> 21:17.740]  Those are super affordable and that is the way to clone.
[21:17.740 --> 21:22.380]  If you want to get expensive, look into buying a turbo cloner or an easy cloner with a manifold
[21:22.380 --> 21:25.740]  and a sprayer and a big body and replaceable collars.
[21:25.740 --> 21:27.620]  That's when cloning gets fucking expensive.
[21:27.700 --> 21:34.740]  I honestly think you could buy the cloning dome and tray and some rapid rooters and you're
[21:34.740 --> 21:38.460]  going to need, however you do this, you're going to need some clone gel of some sort.
[21:38.460 --> 21:41.580]  I recommend the purple clonex shit.
[21:41.580 --> 21:45.420]  I think for the price of the cups you're going to buy, depending on how many clones you want
[21:45.420 --> 21:49.820]  to make, you could probably buy most of your clone domes set up for the same price.
[21:49.820 --> 21:54.660]  If you go to a hydroponic shop or if you even shop on Amazon, if you have to, you can get
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.860]  a dome and a tray for about 15 bucks.
[21:57.100 --> 21:58.500]  Probably get some rapid rooters.
[21:58.500 --> 22:01.380]  Those are going to run you about 30 bucks for a bag of rapid rooters.
[22:01.380 --> 22:05.940]  It's really not that much funding compared to buying cups and hoping that they work.
[22:05.940 --> 22:11.340]  I would encourage you to set yourself up for success and do this the best way that you
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.340]  can.
[22:12.340 --> 22:16.100]  I understand 45 bucks may be a lot of money to somebody who isn't going to make any money
[22:16.100 --> 22:17.100]  off of these clones.
[22:17.100 --> 22:21.940]  You got to wait at least 120 days before there's any profit, any return on investment.
[22:21.940 --> 22:23.460]  But I would just buy the tray.
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.460]  I would buy the dome.
[22:24.460 --> 22:26.340]  I'd buy some rapid rooters or something similar.
[22:26.340 --> 22:27.660]  They don't have to be rapid rooters.
[22:27.660 --> 22:28.660]  There's root riots.
[22:28.660 --> 22:30.340]  There's fucking 20 different brands out there.
[22:30.340 --> 22:31.340]  Pick the one that's on sale.
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.460]  They're all mostly reliable.
[22:32.460 --> 22:33.820]  They're all close to the same thing.
[22:33.820 --> 22:35.220]  Just get the one that's on sale.
[22:35.220 --> 22:37.440]  So you got the tray, maybe the insert.
[22:37.440 --> 22:38.440]  You got a dome.
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.380]  You got some rapid rooters and some clone gel, and then you need scissors and then a
[22:42.380 --> 22:45.560]  way to label these plants and maybe some alcohol to clean up or something.
[22:45.560 --> 22:47.420]  You don't need a lot of things.
[22:47.420 --> 22:48.540]  Just invest a few bucks.
[22:48.540 --> 22:49.780]  That's what I would totally recommend.
[22:49.780 --> 22:51.620]  I know it sounds like you own a business.
[22:51.620 --> 22:52.620]  You got some money.
[22:52.620 --> 22:53.620]  You're saying spend it.
[22:53.620 --> 22:57.100]  I definitely recommend it's going to be a more enjoyable process.
[22:57.100 --> 22:58.360]  You're going to have more pride in it.
[22:58.360 --> 23:01.620]  You're going to enjoy it more, which means you'll make more time for it.
[23:01.620 --> 23:04.800]  You'll put more effort into it, which means you'll get a better product in the end.
[23:04.800 --> 23:06.220]  So spend the few bucks.
[23:06.220 --> 23:08.820]  And when you spend money, then you're going to work harder because you put money into
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.820]  it.
[23:09.820 --> 23:10.820]  This shit's got to work.
[23:10.820 --> 23:12.420]  So that's my recommendation.
[23:12.420 --> 23:17.820]  But the other option was using recycled soil, putting it into a beer cup and using a clear
[23:17.820 --> 23:21.900]  cup or maybe even a bag to cover it to keep the humidity in.
[23:21.900 --> 23:24.140]  I can't find a good dome and tray on Amazon.
[23:24.140 --> 23:27.540]  They are expensive and weird sizes and fragile.
[23:27.540 --> 23:28.540]  They'll get them to you, bro.
[23:28.540 --> 23:30.660]  Amazon will not destroy your clone dome.
[23:30.660 --> 23:35.780]  I've gotten plenty delivered in the mail myself, allegedly, and they're not that expensive.
[23:35.780 --> 23:39.960]  And the size, you can get a 50 cutting tray.
[23:39.960 --> 23:45.660]  It's only, what is 14 inches long, 15, maybe that's about 16 inches long by eight or nine
[23:45.660 --> 23:46.940]  inches wide.
[23:46.940 --> 23:48.060]  That's really not that big, bro.
[23:48.060 --> 23:49.740]  And then you just put the dome right on top of it.
[23:49.740 --> 23:53.180]  If you've already got a grow space with a veg room, you can probably put these in the
[23:53.180 --> 23:55.460]  floor and the peripheral area where the light goes.
[23:55.460 --> 23:58.620]  They don't need a lot of light, just spring for the good year, bro.
[23:58.620 --> 24:04.940]  But if you insist on using soil and cups and domes, uh, by using a cup or a baggie, you
[24:04.940 --> 24:08.420]  can absolutely do that, but make sure you use that root gel.
[24:08.420 --> 24:12.500]  I still recommend cutting them and putting them in some sort of a root gel before you
[24:12.500 --> 24:16.980]  put them in the dirt that will encourage root growth much more drastically than if you just
[24:16.980 --> 24:19.660]  put them in there without any sort of root hormone.
[24:19.660 --> 24:24.060]  Also, if you decide to do this, I would clean out that soil so it's not overloaded with
[24:24.060 --> 24:26.700]  nutrients that are going to burn your plants.
[24:26.700 --> 24:28.020]  You've been feeding that soil.
[24:28.020 --> 24:31.140]  Hopefully maybe you flushed a little bit at the end, but maybe you didn't get all the
[24:31.140 --> 24:32.420]  nutrients out of that soil.
[24:32.420 --> 24:33.860]  There's still stuff in there.
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.860]  I would rinse it out.
[24:34.860 --> 24:39.900]  If you've got any enzymatic products, some SLF 100, some hygrosyme, something like that,
[24:39.900 --> 24:43.380]  I would run a little bit of enzymes, mix it in water and run the enzymes through that
[24:43.380 --> 24:45.140]  soil to help you flush it out.
[24:45.140 --> 24:46.260]  That way it's fresh and clean.
[24:46.260 --> 24:48.340]  There's no pathogens, no problems.
[24:48.340 --> 24:50.460]  Because basically think of it like this.
[24:50.460 --> 24:54.380]  When we cut clones, we are severing a limb off of that plant.
[24:54.380 --> 24:58.300]  Would you like me to just cut your arm off and stick your arm into just some random dirty
[24:58.300 --> 25:04.180]  dirt and hope there's no pathogens that take over and prevent you from growing your arm?
[25:04.180 --> 25:08.180]  Or would you rather me give you some sort of sterile environment with a chance?
[25:08.180 --> 25:11.460]  If it was my arm, bro, I would definitely recommend that sterile environment and get
[25:11.460 --> 25:12.460]  a chance.
[25:12.660 --> 25:15.740]  I understand budget may be the key issue here in the garden.
[25:15.740 --> 25:19.100]  So you can use that recycled soil, but rinse it out.
[25:19.100 --> 25:23.540]  Make sure you put holes in that bottom cup so the water can drain out of the dirt.
[25:23.540 --> 25:27.340]  Then if you put a clear cup or a baggie on top, make sure you just seal it up there.
[25:27.340 --> 25:30.460]  And then you're going to have to learn how to adjust the airflow to that after a few
[25:30.460 --> 25:31.460]  days.
[25:31.460 --> 25:32.540]  It's going to need some air.
[25:32.540 --> 25:34.420]  If you've got a cup, you could poke holes in the cup.
[25:34.420 --> 25:36.820]  The baggie, I'm not sure what you're going to do.
[25:36.820 --> 25:42.620]  Now, your idea will work, but you will be much more successful if you just spring for
[25:42.620 --> 25:48.380]  the dome, the divider thing, the little insert that holds the plugs, the plugs, and the tray
[25:48.380 --> 25:49.380]  part.
[25:49.380 --> 25:50.380]  I said that backwards.
[25:50.380 --> 25:53.420]  The tray, the insert, the plugs on the dome, and maybe like a spray bottle.
[25:53.420 --> 25:55.460]  So you could spray them to keep them moist.
[25:55.460 --> 25:57.500]  That always helps you out a little bit.
[25:57.500 --> 25:58.700]  Some clonex gel for sure.
[25:58.700 --> 26:01.860]  You're going to need some kind of cloning gel and clean scissors.
[26:01.860 --> 26:02.980]  Make sure you clean the scissors.
[26:02.980 --> 26:03.980]  That's definitely important.
[26:04.220 --> 26:08.980]  I think you can make this happen, but my advice is just spring for the proper equipment.
[26:08.980 --> 26:10.780]  Set yourself up for success.
[26:10.780 --> 26:12.460]  Enjoy the grow a little bit better.
[26:12.460 --> 26:13.460]  Invest in it.
[26:13.460 --> 26:15.620]  You're going to spend that 45 bucks on silly shit anyway.
[26:15.620 --> 26:16.900]  Go ahead and put it into the garden.
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.900]  It will reward you.
[26:17.900 --> 26:19.180]  All right, my buddy, Fridge Raider.
[26:19.180 --> 26:20.660]  I do want to thank you for the great message.
[26:20.660 --> 26:22.820]  Thank you for getting me to ramble for a few minutes.
[26:22.820 --> 26:26.500]  Once again, you have won a free pack of seeds, so please do send me your address.
[26:26.500 --> 26:28.940]  I cannot wait to get you a free pack of seeds.
[26:28.940 --> 26:34.620]  And once again, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[26:34.620 --> 26:36.860]  All right, I've got one more message here in front of me.
[26:36.860 --> 26:42.980]  This message also came from the iReed Genetics Grow Help tab on iReedGenetics.com.
[26:42.980 --> 26:45.460]  This one came from our friend Sean from Massachusetts.
[26:45.460 --> 26:46.460]  What up, Sean?
[26:46.460 --> 26:47.460]  Good to meet you, bro.
[26:47.460 --> 26:49.420]  Thank you for the great question.
[26:49.420 --> 26:52.660]  You of course do win a free pack of iReed Genetic Seeds.
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.340]  Please send me your shipping address.
[26:54.340 --> 26:57.700]  Cannot wait to get you a free pack of beans and get those in your garden.
[26:57.700 --> 27:02.260]  Our friend Sean has a general grow question that goes just like this.
[27:02.260 --> 27:03.580]  It says, hi, Rasta Jeff.
[27:03.580 --> 27:04.580]  Hi, Sean.
[27:04.580 --> 27:07.260]  It says, I have a quick breeding question for you.
[27:07.260 --> 27:08.540]  Everybody knows those are my favorite.
[27:08.540 --> 27:13.300]  It says, I have a plant I want to breed with, and it was from a feminized seed.
[27:13.300 --> 27:17.020]  Is it okay to use STS to make her the pollen donor?
[27:17.020 --> 27:19.220]  Yes, absolutely.
[27:19.220 --> 27:20.220]  Yes.
[27:20.220 --> 27:25.780]  Also, would it be okay to then pollinate another feminized plant with that pollen donor?
[27:25.780 --> 27:26.780]  Yes.
[27:26.860 --> 27:27.860]  Yes.
[27:27.860 --> 27:29.180]  Thank you in advance.
[27:29.180 --> 27:30.740]  I appreciate all of the info.
[27:30.740 --> 27:32.140]  You could bless me with.
[27:32.140 --> 27:33.140]  Bro, yes.
[27:33.140 --> 27:34.340]  I have done this.
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.020]  I do this.
[27:36.020 --> 27:37.740]  What strain do I use that is feminized?
[27:37.740 --> 27:38.740]  Let's pick something.
[27:38.740 --> 27:40.500]  Oh, Lemon Sorbet.
[27:40.500 --> 27:43.900]  Somebody else has used the name Lemon Sorbet since then, but a long time ago, a very, very
[27:43.900 --> 27:49.020]  long time ago, before the rain and before the snow, I took my Grateful Dog, which is
[27:49.020 --> 27:50.780]  a feminized seed project.
[27:50.780 --> 27:52.660]  That plant is a feminized plant.
[27:52.660 --> 27:54.060]  And I reversed Grateful Dog.
[27:54.060 --> 27:56.500]  And I put that pollen on Lemon Jeffrey.
[27:56.500 --> 27:59.140]  Lemon Jeffrey is a feminized project.
[27:59.140 --> 28:03.780]  From that reversed pollen, from a reversed, from a female plant, put that pollen on another
[28:03.780 --> 28:05.900]  plant that came from a femme seed.
[28:05.900 --> 28:06.900]  Guess what it made?
[28:06.900 --> 28:08.020]  It made fucking hot fire.
[28:08.020 --> 28:11.180]  That's one of my favorite crosses that I have never put out.
[28:11.180 --> 28:13.980]  When I first made that cross, I put out a bunch of tester seeds.
[28:13.980 --> 28:18.260]  And right after I did it, my social media account got squashed and I lost contact with
[28:18.260 --> 28:19.260]  a lot of people.
[28:19.260 --> 28:20.620]  I was very discouraged.
[28:20.620 --> 28:22.220]  I lost excitement for that cross.
[28:22.220 --> 28:23.220]  And guess what?
[28:23.380 --> 28:26.580]  I put all the seeds in the vault and I've never let them go to anybody other than those
[28:26.580 --> 28:27.580]  testers.
[28:27.580 --> 28:28.860]  I've got a few of them left myself.
[28:28.860 --> 28:31.740]  At the time, I wanted to call them a Lemon Sorbet.
[28:31.740 --> 28:36.300]  I'm pretty sure somebody has taken that name by now, but it was a Grateful Dog reversed
[28:36.300 --> 28:38.220]  onto the Lemon Jeffrey.
[28:38.220 --> 28:42.580]  And both of those are feminized and it made amazing fucking plants.
[28:42.580 --> 28:44.940]  So yes, you can do this.
[28:44.940 --> 28:49.300]  Sometimes if we go too far with generations of selfing a plant, things can go weird.
[28:49.300 --> 28:54.180]  If we do like S2 or S3, sometimes we start going the wrong direction and losing vigor
[28:54.180 --> 28:58.460]  and losing the quality traits and we start seeing slow, weak plants.
[28:58.460 --> 29:03.380]  But most of the time, taking a feminized plant and a feminized plant that are not related
[29:03.380 --> 29:06.700]  to each other, that have not been inbred, that have not been worked together, and you
[29:06.700 --> 29:09.060]  breed those together, that's a new F1.
[29:09.060 --> 29:12.220]  That's a new S1 or an R1, whichever one you want to call it.
[29:12.220 --> 29:17.780]  But that new F1 is going to have hybrid vigor and I definitely recommend that sort of a
[29:17.780 --> 29:18.780]  project.
[29:18.780 --> 29:19.780]  Don't be afraid of fear.
[29:19.780 --> 29:24.020]  Grow your fem seeds, reverse your fem seeds, breed with your fem seeds, have fun with them.
[29:24.020 --> 29:28.260]  The most important part is to pay attention to what happens to the progeny.
[29:28.260 --> 29:30.020]  You've got to grow those out.
[29:30.020 --> 29:33.660]  Sometimes you're going to make some wonky shit, but sometimes you're going to make some
[29:33.660 --> 29:34.700]  amazing shit.
[29:34.700 --> 29:37.140]  Most of the time, it'll come out just like you anticipate.
[29:37.140 --> 29:41.180]  If you can see the traits that come from plant A and the traits that come from plant B and
[29:41.180 --> 29:45.260]  you know you've grown them enough times and you've identified what they do when you breed
[29:45.260 --> 29:49.260]  them, when you reverse one and pollinate the other, you can easily predict what they're
[29:49.260 --> 29:52.540]  going to do if you've developed a relationship with both plants.
[29:52.540 --> 29:57.860]  So I recommend breeding with regulars, fems, breed, breed, breed, have a good time.
[29:57.860 --> 29:59.100]  Thank you for the great question, my dude.
[29:59.100 --> 30:04.220]  Once again, please do send me your address so I can send you a free pack of Irie Genetics
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.220]  Seeds.
[30:05.220 --> 30:10.060]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[30:10.060 --> 30:13.860]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis activists out there, I
[30:13.860 --> 30:18.900]  do want to thank you once again for joining me for episode 800 of the Grow From Your Heart
[30:18.900 --> 30:19.900]  podcast.
[30:19.900 --> 30:21.740]  It feels really good to say 800 episodes.
[30:21.740 --> 30:26.740]  That puts some pride inside of me, puts a smile on my face, puts a new spark in me for
[30:26.740 --> 30:27.740]  podcasting, also a new spark.
[30:27.740 --> 30:29.620]  I hope you guys have been enjoying the new format.
[30:29.620 --> 30:31.260]  I've been trying to cut out some of the nonsense.
[30:31.260 --> 30:33.780]  I cut out the advertising and the shout outs at the front of the show.
[30:33.780 --> 30:37.900]  I try to get in, give you guys the info you need and get out so that you guys can learn
[30:37.900 --> 30:40.620]  some stuff and not have to listen to me ramble for too long.
[30:40.620 --> 30:44.100]  If you do enjoy the rambles, check out my Instagram live show every Monday.
[30:44.100 --> 30:45.100]  That's right.
[30:45.100 --> 30:49.380]  Every Monday around 7, 10 p.m. Mountain Time, I go on Instagram live.
[30:49.380 --> 30:50.700]  I'm Irie underscore genetics.
[30:50.700 --> 30:53.020]  You'll have to type in the whole name to find me.
[30:53.020 --> 30:54.020]  Set your notifications.
[30:54.020 --> 30:55.940]  Monday night, I'll go live.
[30:55.940 --> 30:56.940]  That's where I get rambly.
[30:56.940 --> 30:59.060]  I'll smoke a bunch of dabs and just talk a bunch of shit.
[30:59.060 --> 31:00.180]  We'll listen to reggae music.
[31:00.180 --> 31:01.840]  We'll talk about growing ganja.
[31:01.840 --> 31:02.840]  We'll talk about music.
[31:02.840 --> 31:03.940]  We'll talk about sneakers.
[31:03.940 --> 31:06.740]  Who knows what we might say on the Monday night show.
[31:06.740 --> 31:08.780]  But I really hope you enjoy the new format of the podcast.
[31:08.980 --> 31:11.020]  I've been trying to keep it flowing a little bit.
[31:11.020 --> 31:15.380]  I noticed that people check out about 36 minutes into a podcast, so I definitely keep it around
[31:15.380 --> 31:16.940]  30 minutes for you guys.
[31:16.940 --> 31:18.840]  That way you guys don't get bored of my rambling.
[31:18.840 --> 31:20.420]  But I hope you've been enjoying the new format.
[31:20.420 --> 31:22.060]  I've been trying to keep it flowing.
[31:22.060 --> 31:25.420]  Get in, give you some info and get out without rambling your face off.
[31:25.420 --> 31:28.800]  So thank you for the words of encouragement, the great feedback that I've been getting.
[31:28.800 --> 31:30.560]  And also we've been getting more views.
[31:30.560 --> 31:33.660]  So I do feel like the new idea has been working.
[31:33.660 --> 31:35.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am rambling once again.
