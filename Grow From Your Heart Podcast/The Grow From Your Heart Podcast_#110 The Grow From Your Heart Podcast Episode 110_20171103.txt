[00:19.390 --> 00:23.790]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 110 of the Grow From
[00:23.790 --> 00:28.190]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:28.190 --> 00:31.990]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.990 --> 00:35.710]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.710 --> 00:40.590]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:40.590 --> 00:44.430]  host, my friends, call me Ross DeJeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:44.430 --> 00:47.630]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use
[00:47.630 --> 00:53.270]  their music on my show. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. What's
[00:53.270 --> 00:56.230]  up everybody? I hope you guys are having a great evening, afternoon, morning, whatever
[00:56.230 --> 00:59.910]  time it is, wherever you are. Hope you're hanging out, getting some turps in your head.
[00:59.910 --> 01:03.310]  Hope you're smoking a fat joint. Hope you got a vaporizer packed up. Hope you got a
[01:03.310 --> 01:07.310]  dab ready. Hope you got the e-mail turned on. Maybe you're eating some edibles. You
[01:07.310 --> 01:10.670]  might be smoking a blunt. That's like not my favorite, but if you're smoking a blunt,
[01:10.670 --> 01:14.350]  more power to you. Do what you got to do. Get it in your head. Get them turps in your
[01:14.350 --> 01:18.270]  mind. Set yourself free. You guys, this is going to be a great episode. This is the episode
[01:18.270 --> 01:23.430]  that I recorded in Colorado Springs from the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational. There are a
[01:23.430 --> 01:28.270]  lot of great folks in this episode. This episode features the Grimy Gatsby. This episode features
[01:28.270 --> 01:33.030]  Chris from the Clear Concentrates, and it definitely features a whole bunch of lovely
[01:33.030 --> 01:37.590]  ladies. Before we get to that, this podcast is brought to you by our great friends at
[01:37.590 --> 01:41.390]  Hitman Glass. That's right, Hitman Glass. You guys stay. I'm sitting over here hitting
[01:41.390 --> 01:46.590]  the Hitman mini sidecar with the Hammerhead. I grabbed this one because it's got a yellow
[01:46.590 --> 01:50.510]  label on it, and I haven't seen a lot of Hitman with a yellow label. I really liked it. Thought
[01:50.510 --> 01:54.470]  it looked fresh. The Hammerhead perk in this thing, you guys. Oh my God, this thing hits
[01:54.470 --> 01:57.630]  like a fucking boss. You know what I'm talking about it. I'm going to heat this up for a
[01:57.630 --> 02:01.590]  second here while I'm rambling about Hitman Glass. Let's see. What else do I have to say?
[02:01.590 --> 02:04.830]  I'm going to heat this up. We're going to take a fat dab of some Gorilla. What is it?
[02:04.830 --> 02:09.630]  What do we got? It's Gorilla Glue, live resin from the Garden of Weeden. Let's take a dab
[02:10.390 --> 02:14.390]  is brought to you by our good friends at Hitman Glass. When I'm shopping for a rig, you guys.
[02:14.390 --> 02:17.830]  I want a rig that I know is going to hit like a truck. It's not going to splash water in
[02:17.830 --> 02:22.990]  my mouth. I also want a rig made by an American in America, and not made by some Chinese kid
[02:22.990 --> 02:27.390]  without protective eyewear, with no shoes and not getting paid. You guys, I represent
[02:27.390 --> 02:32.110]  Hitman Glass by Glass Made in America. Hitman Glass is a huge part of the Cannabis and Hash
[02:32.110 --> 02:37.870]  movement. Make sure you check out www.hitmanglass.com. Make sure you follow them on Instagram. It's

[02:46.910 --> 02:47.950]  You guys, let's take a dab.
[02:47.950 --> 02:48.870]  Let's do this.
[02:55.900 --> 02:56.740]  All right.
[02:57.900 --> 02:59.380]  All right, you guys, I'm nice and turped out.
[02:59.380 --> 03:00.500]  Big shout out to Hitman.
[03:00.500 --> 03:01.780]  Make sure you guys support the Hitman crew.
[03:01.780 --> 03:04.420]  Thanks a lot to Dougie and the entire Hitman fam
[03:04.420 --> 03:05.940]  for supporting the podcast.
[03:05.940 --> 03:07.620]  You guys, I don't have a lot else to say.
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.740]  Let's get into the episode.
[03:08.740 --> 03:11.820]  Let's time travel back a few days to Colorado Springs.
[03:11.860 --> 03:14.340]  You guys, it was a lovely snowy afternoon.
[03:14.340 --> 03:16.860]  There were a bunch of lovely ladies in the house.
[03:16.860 --> 03:18.400]  There were a bunch of turpy dudes in the house.
[03:18.400 --> 03:21.140]  There was a table covered in great food
[03:21.140 --> 03:23.100]  and good hash and good weed.
[03:23.100 --> 03:24.100]  So it was a party.
[03:24.100 --> 03:25.820]  Let's let the music take us right
[03:25.820 --> 03:27.200]  into that part of the episode.
[03:27.200 --> 03:29.780]  And then I'll be back to wrap up the show after that.
[03:32.100 --> 03:33.180]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:33.180 --> 03:34.020]  It's your boy, Rasta Jeff.
[03:34.020 --> 03:36.580]  I am here in beautiful Colorado Springs
[03:36.580 --> 03:39.260]  looking out a giant window, looking at a lovely day.
[03:39.260 --> 03:41.180]  It's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.940]  It's gorgeous out there.
[03:42.940 --> 03:44.380]  Sitting across from me, you guys,
[03:44.380 --> 03:47.620]  I am here at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[03:47.620 --> 03:50.060]  And sitting across from me is the lovely Dude It's Damsel.
[03:50.060 --> 03:51.060]  How you doing today?
[03:51.940 --> 03:55.820]  I'm really good and really high.
[03:55.820 --> 03:58.060]  It sounds and looks like the weed that I grew
[03:58.060 --> 03:59.580]  is working for the whole house.
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:00.820 --> 04:03.260]  There is no doubt about that.
[04:03.260 --> 04:07.060]  We've all been stone silly for four days now.
[04:07.060 --> 04:08.580]  Nice, I like that.
[04:08.580 --> 04:09.420]  I like that.
[04:09.420 --> 04:10.780]  Well, our friend Brittany is joining us.
[04:11.380 --> 04:12.220]  She's known as Dude It's Damsel.
[04:12.220 --> 04:13.040]  Her real name is Brittany.
[04:13.040 --> 04:13.880]  Hey, thanks for being on the show.
[04:13.880 --> 04:14.700]  I appreciate that.
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.300]  Yeah, of course, man, anytime.
[04:16.300 --> 04:18.300]  She brought four or five,
[04:18.300 --> 04:19.940]  I can't even count how many lovely ladies there are.
[04:19.940 --> 04:22.420]  She brought four beautiful model friends with her.
[04:22.420 --> 04:23.980]  I'm just gonna go from the left
[04:23.980 --> 04:25.180]  and introduce all the ladies.
[04:25.180 --> 04:26.900]  Sitting to my left is Miss Amanda.
[04:26.900 --> 04:28.780]  What do they call you on Instagram?
[04:28.780 --> 04:31.900]  Ackley Rocks, R-A-W-K-S.
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.740]  There you go, guys.
[04:32.740 --> 04:33.560]  Make sure you follow her.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.400]  Thanks for joining us.
[04:34.400 --> 04:37.200]  We're gonna talk to you a little bit more later, too.
[04:37.200 --> 04:38.040]  Pass the mic for me.
[04:38.040 --> 04:38.860]  Oh, you've got a mic.
[04:38.860 --> 04:39.700]  Nevermind, I gave you a mic.
[04:39.700 --> 04:40.520]  Sitting right in front of me.
[04:41.260 --> 04:42.100]  There you go.
[04:42.100 --> 04:42.920]  I'm really high, too.
[04:42.920 --> 04:43.760]  I just hide it better.
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.080]  Sitting in front of me is my new friend, Shana.
[04:45.080 --> 04:47.080]  Hey, I'm just Shana.
[04:47.080 --> 04:47.920]  Just Shana?
[04:47.920 --> 04:48.740]  Yep.
[04:48.740 --> 04:49.880]  Do you not have an Instagram you wanna shout out?
[04:49.880 --> 04:51.960]  No, I'm super good.
[04:51.960 --> 04:53.300]  Awesome, she's a great photographer, you guys.
[04:53.300 --> 04:54.980]  She has taken some great pictures this weekend.
[04:54.980 --> 04:56.800]  Hopefully, we'll talk more about that.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.960]  I'm gonna give everybody a heads up.
[04:57.960 --> 04:59.760]  Make sure you check out Instagram,
[04:59.760 --> 05:01.560]  hashtag Dude It's Gatsby,
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.360]  and look at some of the pictures that are posted there.
[05:03.360 --> 05:05.540]  You might enjoy some of those.
[05:05.540 --> 05:07.320]  So, sitting at my, I don't know,
[05:07.320 --> 05:09.120]  that's like my noon position here,
[05:09.120 --> 05:09.960]  is Tristan.
[05:10.400 --> 05:11.240]  How you doing?
[05:11.240 --> 05:12.060]  What's up?
[05:12.060 --> 05:12.900]  I'm doing good.
[05:12.900 --> 05:13.720]  Good, good.
[05:13.720 --> 05:14.560]  What's your Instagram handle,
[05:14.560 --> 05:15.400]  so people can stalk you while they're listening?
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.880]  Oh, man, Tristan Renee is my Instagram.
[05:16.880 --> 05:18.920]  All right, and how do you spell Renee at the end there?
[05:18.920 --> 05:19.760]  I know it's different.
[05:19.760 --> 05:20.880]  R-E-N-E-E.
[05:20.880 --> 05:22.080]  I'm a little special.
[05:22.080 --> 05:23.120]  You are special.
[05:23.120 --> 05:23.960]  We like it.
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.120]  All right, sitting way to my right-ish is this shy girl.
[05:27.120 --> 05:27.960]  Do we call you Jacqueline?
[05:27.960 --> 05:28.960]  Do we call you Jackie?
[05:28.960 --> 05:29.780]  Jacqueline, please.
[05:29.780 --> 05:30.620]  Jacqueline, please.
[05:30.620 --> 05:32.040]  All right, what's your Instagram, honey?
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.480]  Hello, my name is underscore Jacqueline.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.680]  All right, make sure you follow her, guys.
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.160]  She's taking some great pictures this weekend.
[05:37.160 --> 05:38.000]  Thanks for joining me, ladies.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.040]  We really appreciate it.
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.360]  Yeah, we're super stoked.
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.880]  Over here, who's gotta grab his mic,
[05:41.880 --> 05:44.560]  blow out his dab, get his shit together.
[05:44.560 --> 05:45.400]  Cough a little bit.
[05:45.400 --> 05:46.240]  This is my buddy, John Hunt.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.060]  How you doing, brother?
[05:47.060 --> 05:47.900]  What's going down?
[05:47.900 --> 05:48.740]  Hanging out, man.
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.840]  This is my buddy, the Grimy Gatsby.
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.040]  This is the man, the myth, the Terp gatherer, the legend.
[05:52.040 --> 05:53.120]  Thanks for joining me, man.
[05:53.120 --> 05:53.960]  Hi.
[05:53.960 --> 05:54.800]  Hi.
[05:54.800 --> 05:55.620]  I'm faded, bro.
[05:55.620 --> 05:56.460]  I just took the biggest dab.
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.300]  That's why I was like,
[05:57.300 --> 05:58.120]  this dude's gonna blow out a dab.
[05:58.120 --> 05:58.960]  I'm all stupid, blown out right now,
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.560]  and I'm trying to talk without coughing and hacking.
[06:00.560 --> 06:01.600]  You can cough on this show.
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.900]  This show will be filled with coughs.
[06:02.900 --> 06:03.740]  That's no problem.
[06:03.780 --> 06:04.860]  Thanks for coming out, bro.
[06:04.860 --> 06:05.680]  Dude, thanks for having me.
[06:05.680 --> 06:07.500]  This is a gorgeous house, a gorgeous location,
[06:07.500 --> 06:09.060]  some gorgeous friends and family.
[06:09.060 --> 06:10.220]  Also in the room, you guys,
[06:10.220 --> 06:11.860]  we're gonna do another podcast after this,
[06:11.860 --> 06:13.060]  and we'll feature these guys,
[06:13.060 --> 06:15.380]  but also in the room, we got Jordan from TerpX.
[06:15.380 --> 06:17.900]  We got our buddy Dan from CCC420,
[06:17.900 --> 06:19.540]  and to my left, my new friend, Chris,
[06:19.540 --> 06:20.980]  from The Clear, The Clear Scientist.
[06:20.980 --> 06:22.320]  Dude, thanks for jumping in.
[06:22.320 --> 06:23.580]  Yeah, we're gonna do a show
[06:23.580 --> 06:25.140]  with all these guys here in just a minute.
[06:25.140 --> 06:26.540]  We may get the guitar out again,
[06:26.540 --> 06:28.900]  if you guys remember what happened on that episode.
[06:28.900 --> 06:30.780]  It got a little Terp sloppy.
[06:30.780 --> 06:32.220]  Yeah, all right, we might do that.
[06:32.220 --> 06:33.820]  So I've got a bunch of notes here on the phone.
[06:33.820 --> 06:35.460]  I should probably open that stuff up
[06:35.460 --> 06:36.580]  and start getting on it.
[06:36.580 --> 06:37.740]  First, before we get too far,
[06:37.740 --> 06:39.740]  I need to learn a little bit about
[06:39.740 --> 06:41.500]  the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[06:41.500 --> 06:43.600]  Do you guys wanna tell me all about that?
[06:45.300 --> 06:49.380]  Sure, so I've kind of been organizing
[06:49.380 --> 06:52.660]  these shoot fests for a few years.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.620]  I used to do it for a different company,
[06:54.620 --> 06:56.540]  where I would bring a bunch of girls
[06:56.540 --> 06:59.060]  and photographers to different locations,
[06:59.060 --> 07:01.060]  and we would make a whole bunch of art
[07:01.060 --> 07:03.020]  and have a really good time.
[07:03.020 --> 07:05.580]  And it was kind of an excuse for all of us
[07:05.580 --> 07:07.940]  to get together, even though we are spread
[07:07.940 --> 07:09.340]  across the country.
[07:09.340 --> 07:14.340]  And I thought, why not do that for cannabis products
[07:14.820 --> 07:15.820]  and for businesses?
[07:15.820 --> 07:18.100]  And so we kind of,
[07:20.060 --> 07:22.460]  I kind of ran the idea past Hunt,
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.840]  and he was like, that could actually happen.
[07:24.840 --> 07:26.620]  It was kind of just an idea.
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.460]  Wouldn't it be cool?
[07:27.460 --> 07:28.820]  I really just wanted an excuse
[07:28.820 --> 07:29.900]  to bring my friends somewhere
[07:29.900 --> 07:31.260]  and watch them run around naked.
[07:31.260 --> 07:32.100]  But he said that-
[07:32.100 --> 07:33.220]  We appreciate that.
[07:33.220 --> 07:36.820]  Yeah, he said that we could make it a real thing
[07:36.820 --> 07:41.820]  and lots of hard work and planning
[07:43.020 --> 07:45.180]  and some sweet sponsors later.
[07:45.180 --> 07:50.180]  And a lot of these guys here teaching me how to be a boss.
[07:50.340 --> 07:52.420]  You already knew how to be a boss before I met you.
[07:52.420 --> 07:54.300]  Well, maybe.
[07:54.300 --> 07:56.180]  I mean, I think lifestyle marketing
[07:56.180 --> 07:58.740]  and kind of like content creation in general
[07:59.100 --> 08:01.660]  is something that numerous businesses,
[08:01.660 --> 08:04.660]  whether big or small, are utilizing in different aspects.
[08:04.660 --> 08:09.660]  And so with the GG Fam and different kind of aspects,
[08:09.860 --> 08:14.860]  and I actually met Damsel at one of those shoots before
[08:14.900 --> 08:18.180]  giving a cannabis class to like the photo shoot
[08:18.180 --> 08:20.460]  and kind of doing some cannabis consulting.
[08:20.460 --> 08:24.380]  But with the people that are in the room now,
[08:24.380 --> 08:27.780]  there's a massive imprint and footprint, so to speak,
[08:27.820 --> 08:30.980]  on how social media and social engineering
[08:30.980 --> 08:33.660]  and lifestyle marketing comes to be very effective.
[08:34.540 --> 08:36.860]  And so it was kind of a double-edged sword
[08:36.860 --> 08:39.820]  with bringing the right people together,
[08:39.820 --> 08:41.700]  but also getting the right brands together
[08:41.700 --> 08:44.820]  to be able to represent what Damsel does really well
[08:44.820 --> 08:46.020]  and what we can put together.
[08:46.020 --> 08:48.460]  And what brands were part of the event this time?
[08:48.460 --> 08:50.300]  Is this the first event you guys have done like this?
[08:50.300 --> 08:53.420]  This is the first one, the first ever.
[08:53.420 --> 08:54.780]  The first of its kind.
[08:54.780 --> 08:56.260]  So who joined on for this one?
[08:57.020 --> 08:59.180]  You wanna, I can, I mean, I can rattle them off pretty fast,
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.020]  but it's-
[09:00.020 --> 09:01.020]  Well, they all deserve a shout out.
[09:01.020 --> 09:03.420]  Yeah, we have all kinds of different companies
[09:03.420 --> 09:05.940]  came to be, obviously, iReGenetics had a nice part
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.460]  with some of the stuff we've been putting in the air
[09:07.460 --> 09:08.300]  for the week.
[09:08.300 --> 09:11.540]  Apothecana came through with a bunch of great holistic
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.340]  topicals that we've been using
[09:13.340 --> 09:15.180]  and also having some great shoots.
[09:15.180 --> 09:17.580]  Turpex is an unbelievable sponsor that not only
[09:17.580 --> 09:19.660]  has like done all this stuff from like sponsoring
[09:19.660 --> 09:22.180]  the vehicles to other aspects,
[09:22.180 --> 09:24.220]  the Clear Concentrate, as well as their whole
[09:24.220 --> 09:25.340]  subsidiary of brands.
[09:25.340 --> 09:27.100]  How about that popcorn?
[09:27.100 --> 09:28.500]  That popcorn from the Clear?
[09:28.500 --> 09:30.340]  Yeah, I went like a thousand milligrams deep yesterday
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.180]  and saw myself.
[09:31.180 --> 09:33.500]  Oh man, I slept like an infant.
[09:33.500 --> 09:35.100]  Man, it was wonderful.
[09:35.100 --> 09:36.780]  I looked at my, I was like, I think something's moving.
[09:36.780 --> 09:38.140]  I looked and I was like, my hand's on the wall,
[09:38.140 --> 09:38.980]  how's something moving?
[09:38.980 --> 09:40.140]  And I looked down and I was like, wait, that's me
[09:40.140 --> 09:40.980]  just trembling right now.
[09:40.980 --> 09:41.820]  Just trembling, just shaking.
[09:41.820 --> 09:43.820]  Trying to keep it together as I'm rolling.
[09:43.820 --> 09:45.180]  Yeah, so the Clear came through huge.
[09:45.180 --> 09:47.500]  You know, Chris coming out in person is a blessing
[09:47.500 --> 09:49.660]  in general, just having out the scientists.
[09:51.100 --> 09:52.020]  Oh, the mats.
[09:52.020 --> 09:54.460]  Mood mats, yeah, mood mats came through.
[09:54.460 --> 09:56.900]  They sent out a box of rubber that you could literally
[09:56.900 --> 09:59.540]  like wear as a jacket and stay warm for the whole winter.
[09:59.540 --> 10:01.820]  I mean like mats that can cover that coffee table
[10:01.820 --> 10:03.820]  right there that we're staring at and all kinds of shit.
[10:03.820 --> 10:04.660]  Yeah, so unbelievable.
[10:04.660 --> 10:06.140]  Quick get your mom's table all sticky.
[10:06.140 --> 10:06.980]  Yeah.
[10:08.580 --> 10:10.660]  Green and Healthy Wellness, we had some places there
[10:10.660 --> 10:14.260]  that we shot at and saw what was going down with that.
[10:14.260 --> 10:16.540]  There are, what other ones?
[10:16.540 --> 10:21.100]  That, yeah, that's it, two of the bikes.
[10:21.100 --> 10:22.460]  All of the people that are here, obviously,
[10:22.460 --> 10:23.940]  all of the ladies and their brands.
[10:24.380 --> 10:25.220]  Shout out to all the ladies that are traveling.
[10:25.220 --> 10:27.300]  This was a huge success.
[10:27.300 --> 10:29.260]  We brought out a bunch of veteran models
[10:29.260 --> 10:32.620]  and a veteran photographer and girls that are really used
[10:32.620 --> 10:34.980]  to like pitching in and doing their share of the work
[10:34.980 --> 10:37.380]  and helping out and we all get along really well.
[10:37.380 --> 10:39.940]  But we know how to work really hard to get the job done.
[10:39.940 --> 10:41.860]  So it was a lot of work and a lot of play.
[10:41.860 --> 10:44.940]  And we just had a, you know, a really great group of girls
[10:44.940 --> 10:47.580]  that are really good friends spread across the country.
[10:47.580 --> 10:49.660]  And when we get together, it's like nothing changed.
[10:49.660 --> 10:50.900]  So it's been awesome.
[10:50.900 --> 10:52.780]  We keep talking about friends from across the country.
[10:52.780 --> 10:55.060]  Where is everybody in the room from?
[10:55.060 --> 10:55.900]  I'm from LA.
[10:55.900 --> 10:58.420]  Okay, Ms. Shana.
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.580]  I'm from Boston.
[10:59.580 --> 11:01.540]  Oh, opposite ends of the country, nice.
[11:01.540 --> 11:03.020]  Meeting in Colorado.
[11:03.020 --> 11:03.860]  Tristan?
[11:03.860 --> 11:05.220]  I'm from Long Beach.
[11:05.220 --> 11:06.420]  Nice, that's kind of my neighborhood.
[11:06.420 --> 11:08.180]  I'm from Bellflower.
[11:08.180 --> 11:11.420]  I'm from Chicago, but just moved to Phoenix three months ago.
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.980]  Oh, wow, how's that for a change?
[11:12.980 --> 11:13.820]  I love it.
[11:13.820 --> 11:15.300]  Nice, nice, you get to ride your bike more?
[11:15.300 --> 11:16.140]  Yes.
[11:16.140 --> 11:17.220]  Nice, this young lady rides a Harley
[11:17.220 --> 11:18.420]  and she looks awesome doing it.
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.660]  Shout out to you and your bike.
[11:19.660 --> 11:20.540]  Thank you.
[11:20.540 --> 11:22.060]  All right, so one of the things that we really,
[11:22.060 --> 11:23.980]  so big shout out to the dude,
[11:23.980 --> 11:24.820]  that's hard for me to remember,
[11:24.820 --> 11:26.660]  the dude, it's Gatsby Invitational.
[11:26.660 --> 11:28.780]  That's a lot of words for my stone nest to remember.
[11:28.780 --> 11:30.900]  But shout out for letting me be a part of that.
[11:30.900 --> 11:32.100]  Look, the snow is coming down again.
[11:32.100 --> 11:33.060]  This is such a great view.
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.300]  Shout out to the people that let us use this house.
[11:35.300 --> 11:36.140]  Yeah.
[11:36.140 --> 11:36.980]  Yeah, this is a dope house.
[11:36.980 --> 11:39.700]  So one of the things that really made this weekend special,
[11:39.700 --> 11:42.420]  Ms. Damsel, actually we're gonna blame this mostly on Hunt.
[11:42.420 --> 11:45.740]  A few months ago, Hunt put me in touch with Ms. Damsel
[11:45.740 --> 11:48.840]  and she asked me if I would breed a strain for her.
[11:48.840 --> 11:50.900]  So a lot of what's been going on this weekend
[11:50.900 --> 11:53.940]  is we have all been smoking what will become
[11:53.940 --> 11:56.060]  or possibly not become from what the talk has been,
[11:56.060 --> 11:58.820]  some things that may become Damsel's dink.
[11:58.820 --> 12:00.800]  So you've got a little notebook in front of you.
[12:00.800 --> 12:03.020]  Have you guys decided which is your favorite
[12:03.020 --> 12:04.820]  and least favorites and such?
[12:04.820 --> 12:08.620]  I mean, I think the overwhelming favorite is what ladies?
[12:08.620 --> 12:09.460]  The B4.
[12:09.460 --> 12:11.040]  B4, okay.
[12:11.040 --> 12:11.880]  All right, can you describe?
[12:11.880 --> 12:12.980]  It's like an echo in the room.
[12:12.980 --> 12:15.340]  Yeah, yeah, all right, so B4 is the winner.
[12:15.340 --> 12:17.340]  I've always had, I mean, judging competitions
[12:17.340 --> 12:18.820]  and being a part of a lot of different stuff,
[12:18.820 --> 12:20.660]  I mean, obviously putting you all together
[12:21.380 --> 12:23.060]  is great stuff for us to all flavor.
[12:23.060 --> 12:25.140]  I have a veteran rule in doing this,
[12:25.140 --> 12:27.500]  but the one that's gone first is always the winner.
[12:27.500 --> 12:28.980]  True, the one that everybody smoked up.
[12:28.980 --> 12:30.740]  B4 was gone first the first time.
[12:30.740 --> 12:33.220]  B4 was gone first this time at the house.
[12:33.220 --> 12:34.780]  Nice, I've got some more B4 in the car.
[12:34.780 --> 12:36.260]  I'll have to throw some on the counter before I leave.
[12:36.260 --> 12:37.540]  Yes, please.
[12:37.540 --> 12:39.380]  All right, so for the people that didn't get a chance
[12:39.380 --> 12:42.860]  to smoke it, can you describe what you thought of B4
[12:42.860 --> 12:44.260]  since you've got your notes right in front of you?
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.260]  Yeah, so I thought it smelled a little bit like pineapple
[12:49.380 --> 12:54.100]  with a hint of citrus, but the taste was a little bit more,
[12:54.100 --> 12:57.580]  I was so high when I did this, I drew a campfire.
[12:57.580 --> 12:59.740]  There's a campfire, I can see it on our page, guys.
[12:59.740 --> 13:01.500]  I said it was like a little bit floral
[13:01.500 --> 13:03.660]  with a hint of birch and that it was nature-y.
[13:03.660 --> 13:07.140]  I said it kind of tasted like camping.
[13:07.140 --> 13:07.980]  Okay.
[13:09.100 --> 13:12.460]  And it was, you know, had some nice orange hairs.
[13:12.460 --> 13:17.460]  It was frosty and yeah, we have been really enjoying it.
[13:18.260 --> 13:22.060]  There's been lots of giggles, lots of good times.
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.660]  The bitches love B4.
[13:23.660 --> 13:25.260]  The bitches, can I call you guys the bitches
[13:25.260 --> 13:27.780]  for the length of the show and I'll stop right after?
[13:27.780 --> 13:30.700]  Oh, I gotta look, I'm not gonna do that.
[13:30.700 --> 13:33.220]  I think you have to have tits to use that word.
[13:33.220 --> 13:35.340]  I asked and I got totally denied.
[13:36.940 --> 13:37.980]  I have found my boundary.
[13:37.980 --> 13:39.500]  You need to smoke more B4.
[13:39.500 --> 13:40.980]  Gotta smoke more B4.
[13:40.980 --> 13:44.140]  All right, so did anybody else in the room get a campfire
[13:44.140 --> 13:45.740]  or tastes like camping aroma?
[13:45.740 --> 13:46.860]  I'm just curious about that.
[13:47.380 --> 13:48.220]  Totally, all right.
[13:48.220 --> 13:49.060]  I mentioned it.
[13:49.060 --> 13:50.100]  She's kind of a chef.
[13:50.100 --> 13:51.420]  Aren't you a chef?
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.260]  I am.
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.460]  You've been cooking the entire time I've been here.
[13:53.460 --> 13:55.700]  This is the first time you haven't been cooking.
[13:55.700 --> 13:57.660]  Yeah, I'm taking a break.
[13:57.660 --> 13:58.500]  You're taking a break, well, thank you.
[13:58.500 --> 13:59.340]  I appreciate it.
[13:59.340 --> 14:01.340]  And you say it does kind of taste like campfire.
[14:01.340 --> 14:02.180]  It does.
[14:02.180 --> 14:03.020]  In a good way?
[14:03.020 --> 14:03.860]  Yes.
[14:03.860 --> 14:04.860]  Okay, all right, because when I think of campfire,
[14:04.860 --> 14:05.980]  I think like when you go camping
[14:05.980 --> 14:07.860]  and your hair smells like campfire.
[14:07.860 --> 14:08.700]  Not like that.
[14:08.700 --> 14:10.660]  That's just because everything stays in your hair.
[14:10.660 --> 14:11.580]  That's, yeah.
[14:11.580 --> 14:13.300]  Hey, what kind of dreadlock joke is that, mama?
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.900]  Grab a mic if you're gonna talk.
[14:15.860 --> 14:16.700]  I'm so sorry.
[14:16.700 --> 14:17.540]  We heard you.
[14:17.540 --> 14:18.980]  They're loud enough to where they kind of got you,
[14:18.980 --> 14:20.220]  but it heard you.
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.460]  All right, so B4, was there a runner up?
[14:24.060 --> 14:28.540]  Yeah, I also really enjoyed the A3.
[14:28.540 --> 14:29.700]  A3, all right.
[14:29.700 --> 14:33.700]  Which I thought, it smelled like fruity pebbles,
[14:33.700 --> 14:35.940]  a little bit like black cherry,
[14:35.940 --> 14:38.460]  but it tasted a little more diesel-y.
[14:38.460 --> 14:41.740]  But that one had super sparkly turps on it.
[14:42.260 --> 14:46.700]  And I described the overall high as sway feels,
[14:46.700 --> 14:48.740]  you know, when you like get super high
[14:48.740 --> 14:51.140]  and you just like start swaying in the kitchen.
[14:51.140 --> 14:53.140]  Nice, just kind of leaning, just back and forth.
[14:53.140 --> 14:54.500]  Yeah, just kind of leaning.
[14:54.500 --> 14:56.060]  Can't pick which way your feet wanna go.
[14:56.060 --> 14:56.900]  Yeah.
[14:56.900 --> 14:58.140]  All right, this sways.
[14:58.140 --> 14:59.780]  All right, so does anybody wanna know
[14:59.780 --> 15:00.820]  what was in these crosses?
[15:00.820 --> 15:02.980]  I know all the boys in the room are staring at me.
[15:02.980 --> 15:04.140]  They're going, tell me what's in there.
[15:04.140 --> 15:06.140]  We have been waiting.
[15:06.140 --> 15:07.620]  Yeah, this was fun to mess with everybody.
[15:07.620 --> 15:10.060]  Did anybody try any of the letter C?
[15:10.060 --> 15:11.700]  Did any of that get tasted?
[15:12.540 --> 15:13.620]  Can we all agree that was just dookie
[15:13.620 --> 15:14.460]  and I shouldn't grow that anymore?
[15:14.460 --> 15:16.900]  But we just didn't even write anything down for it.
[15:16.900 --> 15:17.780]  It was no good.
[15:17.780 --> 15:19.220]  Yeah, that's why there were three
[15:19.220 --> 15:21.460]  that were from that selection and I didn't bring them.
[15:21.460 --> 15:23.660]  So the way I did this, I ran,
[15:24.660 --> 15:27.820]  I think I started with 20 seeds of three different strains
[15:27.820 --> 15:29.900]  and I narrowed it down through the veg phase
[15:29.900 --> 15:30.740]  and through flour.
[15:30.740 --> 15:33.460]  I ended up with three of letter A
[15:33.460 --> 15:34.620]  and I just labeled the seeds
[15:34.620 --> 15:35.540]  so that nobody knew what they were.
[15:35.540 --> 15:37.220]  I was just, this is brand A, this is brand B,
[15:37.220 --> 15:38.040]  this is brand C.
[15:38.040 --> 15:41.300]  I had three of letter A, four of B and three of C.
[15:41.300 --> 15:42.940]  C's are dookie, just got rid of them.
[15:42.940 --> 15:43.980]  We don't need that, it's crap.
[15:43.980 --> 15:45.580]  I'm not even gonna grow any more of those seeds.
[15:45.580 --> 15:46.500]  Throw it all away.
[15:46.500 --> 15:51.540]  A, C was Transformer to Daybreaker
[15:51.540 --> 15:53.500]  from Gage Green Genetics.
[15:53.500 --> 15:57.060]  Transformer is Inferno, Hayes and Chem D
[15:57.060 --> 16:01.140]  and then the, what's the other one I said it is?
[16:01.140 --> 16:01.980]  Sorry, I'm lost now.
[16:01.980 --> 16:04.100]  Chem D, it's Inferno, Hayes and Daybreaker.
[16:04.100 --> 16:08.260]  Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[16:08.260 --> 16:09.140]  All right, yeah.
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.740]  So many genetics in my head that I get confused.
[16:11.100 --> 16:11.940]  But the winners are.
[16:11.940 --> 16:13.180]  Terp nerd.
[16:13.180 --> 16:14.820]  I am kind of a terp nerd, I'll take that.
[16:14.820 --> 16:17.320]  A is Space Queen crossed to Grateful Dog.
[16:17.320 --> 16:18.660]  I used a female Space Queen
[16:18.660 --> 16:20.820]  and a male, a reverse male Grateful Dog.
[16:20.820 --> 16:21.820]  So it's a feminized seed.
[16:21.820 --> 16:22.940]  But it's Space Queen.
[16:22.940 --> 16:24.740]  Yeah, Space Queen to Grateful Dog is what that is.
[16:24.740 --> 16:26.820]  So it's my Space Queen or my Grateful Dog
[16:26.820 --> 16:28.980]  that I made to sub-cool Space Queen.
[16:28.980 --> 16:31.560]  A real tall, stretchy phenotype of the Space Queen.
[16:31.560 --> 16:33.900]  That's where that fruity, funky, moldy smell comes from
[16:33.900 --> 16:34.900]  is the Space Queen.
[16:34.900 --> 16:37.340]  And it's the Romulan that makes it grow those orange,
[16:37.340 --> 16:40.460]  real orange pistols, the real fingery calyxes.
[16:41.180 --> 16:42.020]  That's from Romulan.
[16:42.020 --> 16:43.820]  So B, the one that everybody loves.
[16:43.820 --> 16:45.780]  Everybody's guessed it so many times accurately.
[16:45.780 --> 16:47.140]  It's Lemon Skunk from Arion.
[16:47.140 --> 16:48.580]  It's Greenhouse Seeds Lemon Skunk.
[16:48.580 --> 16:50.860]  It's Arions from Lemon Man.
[16:50.860 --> 16:52.780]  And then it's crossed to the Daybreaker
[16:52.780 --> 16:55.060]  from Gage Green Genetics with the Joseph OG
[16:55.060 --> 16:57.980]  and the Chem D in there.
[16:57.980 --> 16:59.220]  So that's what that one is.
[16:59.220 --> 17:01.260]  Lemon Skunk and Daybreaker.
[17:01.260 --> 17:02.780]  It needs a good name if it's.
[17:02.780 --> 17:05.260]  So what I've heard, you might not decide
[17:05.260 --> 17:07.540]  that this is gonna be the keeper.
[17:07.540 --> 17:09.940]  You know, they were all super, super good.
[17:10.380 --> 17:13.540]  But I feel like there's just another strain
[17:13.540 --> 17:16.500]  that I compare all of my hives to.
[17:16.500 --> 17:17.340]  And.
[17:17.340 --> 17:18.180]  Don't say the name of it,
[17:18.180 --> 17:19.100]  because we're gonna keep that secret
[17:19.100 --> 17:20.500]  and do this all over again.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.740]  But so I think we should try to put that in the mix
[17:22.740 --> 17:24.300]  and maybe do the process over.
[17:24.300 --> 17:25.380]  But I mean. I'm cool with that.
[17:25.380 --> 17:27.380]  There were so many good.
[17:27.380 --> 17:29.620]  What was the B one that was another really, really good one?
[17:29.620 --> 17:31.740]  B one, and that's the Lemon Skunk Daybreaker cross.
[17:31.740 --> 17:34.100]  So all of the Bs will be Lemon Skunk to Daybreaker.
[17:34.100 --> 17:36.220]  And all of the As are Grateful Dog and Space Queen.
[17:36.220 --> 17:37.540]  And all the Cs were trash.
[17:37.540 --> 17:38.380]  Okay.
[17:38.380 --> 17:39.900]  So the ones that you guys really liked,
[17:40.740 --> 17:41.580]  we're gonna work on getting those
[17:41.580 --> 17:42.780]  on the shelf at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[17:42.780 --> 17:44.060]  It'll take a while.
[17:44.060 --> 17:47.420]  Yeah. That's the A3.
[17:47.420 --> 17:48.740]  A3, we'll get that there.
[17:48.740 --> 17:49.580]  And B4, I believe.
[17:49.580 --> 17:50.420]  And B4.
[17:50.420 --> 17:51.260]  Maybe even B1.
[17:51.260 --> 17:52.100]  B1 is super good.
[17:52.100 --> 17:52.940]  I really liked B1.
[17:52.940 --> 17:53.780]  Yeah.
[17:53.780 --> 17:54.620]  Yeah.
[17:54.620 --> 17:55.660]  Yeah. I mean, the Phenos all came out fantastic.
[17:55.660 --> 17:56.900]  The Terpy Boys are across the room.
[17:56.900 --> 17:59.380]  And when I said B1, I got two thumbs ups on the B1.
[17:59.380 --> 18:00.780]  So there'll be some new stuff
[18:00.780 --> 18:02.380]  showing up at Green and Healthy Wellness, you guys.
[18:02.380 --> 18:03.380]  That'll be a little bit.
[18:03.380 --> 18:05.220]  Be a couple of harvests, but we'll make it happen.
[18:05.220 --> 18:06.940]  I mean, it all got smoked.
[18:06.940 --> 18:08.420]  So I think it's fine.
[18:08.420 --> 18:09.740]  It's all great.
[18:10.580 --> 18:12.420]  And kudos to you, brother.
[18:12.420 --> 18:13.260]  Thank you.
[18:13.260 --> 18:14.940]  Thank you for some nice fire to smoke for the event.
[18:14.940 --> 18:15.780]  We made some amazing stuff.
[18:15.780 --> 18:16.620]  We appreciate all that.
[18:16.620 --> 18:18.500]  I've watched all these ladies be really high,
[18:18.500 --> 18:21.420]  but when they don't smoke like the Colorado folk do,
[18:21.420 --> 18:24.300]  they come and get wrecked and it's pretty entertaining.
[18:24.300 --> 18:25.740]  Not making fun of you, I love it.
[18:25.740 --> 18:26.580]  I love it.
[18:26.580 --> 18:28.380]  And then the Terpy Boys have just been smoking
[18:28.380 --> 18:30.620]  all the B1 and B4 like champions.
[18:30.620 --> 18:31.460]  What'd you write?
[18:31.460 --> 18:32.460]  What are your notes?
[18:32.460 --> 18:34.820]  Okay, so Jacqueline over here,
[18:36.140 --> 18:37.980]  she did her own.
[18:37.980 --> 18:38.820]  Don't they call you dimples?
[18:38.860 --> 18:40.700]  I'm gonna call you dimples.
[18:40.700 --> 18:41.540]  She's getting so shy.
[18:41.540 --> 18:42.380]  That's hilarious.
[18:42.380 --> 18:45.940]  So Jacqueline did her own notes for the B4.
[18:45.940 --> 18:47.700]  That was when we smoked it at-
[18:47.700 --> 18:49.460]  Yeah, she was already really high
[18:49.460 --> 18:51.220]  and I was like, write down how you feel.
[18:51.220 --> 18:54.820]  And just for appearance, she wrote green.
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.540]  Potency, she wrote good.
[18:58.300 --> 19:00.140]  Taste, she wrote tasty.
[19:02.260 --> 19:03.100]  Creative.
[19:03.100 --> 19:05.380]  We were just giggling at her notes.
[19:07.420 --> 19:08.340]  She's all blushing.
[19:08.980 --> 19:09.820]  I like it.
[19:09.820 --> 19:10.860]  I have more notes that we could go over
[19:10.860 --> 19:13.540]  unless anybody has more stuff to say about this weed.
[19:17.020 --> 19:18.860]  So talk to us about what's up with that pheno.
[19:18.860 --> 19:20.220]  How long is B4?
[19:20.220 --> 19:21.420]  How high does it get?
[19:21.420 --> 19:22.380]  What does it yield?
[19:22.380 --> 19:25.380]  So B1 and B, all of the Bs were very, very similar
[19:25.380 --> 19:26.260]  in growth.
[19:26.260 --> 19:27.940]  You could barely see a difference in them.
[19:27.940 --> 19:28.860]  They kind of stretch.
[19:28.860 --> 19:30.820]  The lemon skunk makes them stretch pretty well.
[19:30.820 --> 19:31.700]  They grow real dense.
[19:31.700 --> 19:33.580]  They grow real chunky.
[19:33.580 --> 19:35.140]  They could take 70 days.
[19:35.140 --> 19:36.180]  These went 63.
[19:36.180 --> 19:37.540]  I think it could have gone another week,
[19:37.580 --> 19:38.860]  but I was pressed for time.
[19:38.860 --> 19:40.060]  What about the A?
[19:40.060 --> 19:42.740]  The A was done at eight weeks.
[19:42.740 --> 19:43.620]  Finished at eight weeks.
[19:43.620 --> 19:44.940]  One of them started to herm.
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.940]  You could probably see it
[19:45.940 --> 19:47.500]  if you guys are experienced weed growers.
[19:47.500 --> 19:48.540]  And if you got one of the top buds,
[19:48.540 --> 19:50.140]  you could see herm flowers in there.
[19:50.140 --> 19:50.980]  It was just starting.
[19:50.980 --> 19:51.980]  The banana bud, man.
[19:51.980 --> 19:52.820]  Yeah, man.
[19:52.820 --> 19:54.260]  So I can't work.
[19:54.260 --> 19:55.260]  I don't remember which one it is.
[19:55.260 --> 19:57.260]  I took pictures and marked it down in the photos and stuff,
[19:57.260 --> 19:59.220]  but I don't remember off the top of my head.
[19:59.220 --> 20:00.580]  But I marked down which one was a herm.
[20:00.580 --> 20:01.620]  That'll have to go.
[20:01.620 --> 20:03.300]  Which one brought in the most?
[20:03.300 --> 20:04.900]  The most flower?
[20:04.900 --> 20:06.100]  B1.
[20:06.140 --> 20:08.380]  B1 brought in just, yeah, there was,
[20:08.380 --> 20:09.500]  most of them, they're little plants.
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.740]  They harvested about an ounce and a half.
[20:10.740 --> 20:12.340]  B1 was about two and a half ounces.
[20:12.340 --> 20:13.180]  Bless.
[20:13.180 --> 20:14.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:14.020 --> 20:14.860]  So B1's a keeper.
[20:14.860 --> 20:15.700]  Yes, I.
[20:15.700 --> 20:17.020]  We got another Rasta on the microphone.
[20:17.020 --> 20:17.860]  That's always nice.
[20:17.860 --> 20:19.060]  Yeah.
[20:19.060 --> 20:21.460]  So you know what your favorite strain is basically,
[20:21.460 --> 20:22.300]  Damsel.
[20:22.300 --> 20:23.740]  You figured that out.
[20:23.740 --> 20:27.140]  We're gonna cross something of mine to that strain.
[20:27.140 --> 20:28.180]  Some of our friends in the room
[20:28.180 --> 20:30.100]  actually have a clone of your favorite strain.
[20:30.100 --> 20:32.980]  They've given me blessings to work with that.
[20:32.980 --> 20:33.820]  So I'm gonna play with it
[20:33.820 --> 20:34.860]  and we're gonna make you a new strain.
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.340]  We'll do this all over again.
[20:36.340 --> 20:38.020]  When are you ladies coming back?
[20:38.020 --> 20:38.900]  Soon, I hope.
[20:38.900 --> 20:39.740]  All right.
[20:39.740 --> 20:40.980]  Yeah, everybody's.
[20:40.980 --> 20:43.620]  This is gonna take me, let's see, 120,
[20:43.620 --> 20:44.780]  give me about a year.
[20:44.780 --> 20:46.180]  Honest, I'm not even shitting.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.340]  Like because I know what I wanna do.
[20:47.340 --> 20:49.940]  I need to get the clone that you want me to work with
[20:49.940 --> 20:51.220]  and then I'm going to reverse it.
[20:51.220 --> 20:52.380]  I'm going to make it a boy.
[20:52.380 --> 20:53.220]  It's a girl.
[20:53.220 --> 20:54.380]  I'm gonna turn it into a boy.
[20:54.380 --> 20:55.860]  I'm gonna collect pollen from it.
[20:55.860 --> 20:58.580]  Then I'm gonna put pollen on another clone of the same plant
[20:58.580 --> 20:59.660]  and then I'm also put pollen
[20:59.660 --> 21:01.660]  on like nine other bitches in the room
[21:01.660 --> 21:02.540]  and then we're gonna smoke all,
[21:02.540 --> 21:03.940]  we're gonna grow those out
[21:03.940 --> 21:04.980]  and we'll smoke a bunch of those.
[21:04.980 --> 21:06.620]  We'll do this all over again.
[21:06.620 --> 21:07.460]  That sounds like a really good plan.
[21:07.460 --> 21:09.700]  Yeah, that's like three harvests pretty much, right?
[21:09.700 --> 21:10.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:10.540 --> 21:11.580]  Maybe three or four without fuck ups.
[21:11.580 --> 21:12.420]  It's gonna be a minute.
[21:12.420 --> 21:13.260]  Plus some curing.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.100]  Yeah.
[21:14.100 --> 21:15.900]  And we're gonna have a whole bunch of stuff growing in.
[21:15.900 --> 21:17.500]  You can't rush perfection.
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.540]  That is the truth
[21:18.540 --> 21:21.380]  and we wanna find your strain just for you.
[21:21.380 --> 21:22.780]  I appreciate that, man.
[21:22.780 --> 21:23.620]  What are we smoking right now?
[21:23.620 --> 21:24.580]  Which one is this?
[21:25.740 --> 21:27.140]  Microphone.
[21:27.140 --> 21:27.980]  B9.
[21:27.980 --> 21:28.820]  B9, okay.
[21:29.980 --> 21:31.460]  It's got a cotton candy, lemon candy taste.
[21:31.460 --> 21:32.300]  It's like musky.
[21:32.300 --> 21:33.260]  It's very sweet.
[21:33.580 --> 21:35.580]  That's the Daybreaker that gives it the musky.
[21:35.580 --> 21:38.140]  Daybreaker's got some real OG Kush influence to it.
[21:38.140 --> 21:39.860]  Shout out to Gage Green Genetics.
[21:39.860 --> 21:42.020]  I feel it's real important to give shout outs
[21:42.020 --> 21:45.100]  to the people that let me breed with their strains.
[21:45.100 --> 21:47.140]  Gage completely encourages me to work with his stuff.
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.180]  So thanks, dude.
[21:48.180 --> 21:49.460]  The whole Gage Green Genetics crew.
[21:49.460 --> 21:50.300]  It's not just one person.
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.380]  It's a group of people.
[21:51.380 --> 21:52.820]  So have you guys ever done a tasting party
[21:52.820 --> 21:54.540]  or anything like this before?
[21:54.540 --> 21:55.460]  No.
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.500]  All the girls said no.
[21:56.500 --> 21:57.380]  All the ladies said no.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.260]  How about you guys over there?
[21:58.260 --> 21:59.940]  Tasting party, you ever done something like this?
[21:59.940 --> 22:00.780]  Yeah.
[22:00.780 --> 22:01.620]  Nice.
[22:01.620 --> 22:02.460]  Well, thanks for being involved with it.
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.620]  Fist bump for putting me in this position.
[22:04.620 --> 22:05.460]  That is awesome.
[22:05.460 --> 22:06.300]  What's up?
[22:06.300 --> 22:07.140]  Thanks, man.
[22:07.140 --> 22:08.020]  We've revealed the winner.
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.540]  I told you what everything is.
[22:09.540 --> 22:10.820]  We're gonna do it again.
[22:11.780 --> 22:12.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:12.620 --> 22:13.460]  All right.
[22:13.460 --> 22:15.100]  So I wrote this down.
[22:15.100 --> 22:17.300]  Hey, Miss Amanda, I see you got your phone over there.
[22:17.300 --> 22:19.620]  You've got a book coming out.
[22:19.620 --> 22:21.380]  A cookbook?
[22:21.380 --> 22:22.220]  You talked about it.
[22:22.220 --> 22:23.540]  You want me to just cut that part out?
[22:23.540 --> 22:26.980]  I was gonna give you a chance to shout out your cookbook.
[22:26.980 --> 22:30.580]  I am finishing a cookbook that I've been inspired
[22:30.620 --> 22:34.980]  by this trip to quickly finish by the first of January.
[22:34.980 --> 22:35.820]  Nice.
[22:35.820 --> 22:36.660]  Stay tuned.
[22:36.660 --> 22:37.580]  What's your cookbook called?
[22:37.580 --> 22:39.860]  It's gonna be called Eat Yourself Thin.
[22:39.860 --> 22:41.660]  And you said it's mostly for women?
[22:41.660 --> 22:46.180]  It's gonna be for everybody.
[22:46.180 --> 22:50.180]  I think that everyone should know how to cook clean
[22:50.180 --> 22:52.420]  and simple and on a budget.
[22:52.420 --> 22:53.300]  So that's how it's gonna be.
[22:53.300 --> 22:57.220]  So whether you cook for your boyfriend or girlfriend
[22:57.220 --> 22:59.940]  or significant other, husband, wife,
[23:00.260 --> 23:02.220]  it's for those people.
[23:02.220 --> 23:03.060]  Awesome.
[23:03.060 --> 23:05.340]  So you'll have it finished by the end of the year.
[23:06.260 --> 23:08.340]  And then how long to get it out?
[23:08.340 --> 23:09.700]  Oh.
[23:09.700 --> 23:11.140]  We'll do a Skype interview when it comes out.
[23:11.140 --> 23:12.980]  Because you've cooked for the house
[23:12.980 --> 23:14.980]  and I ate some of the leftovers last night.
[23:14.980 --> 23:17.580]  And I drove home like a satisfied man.
[23:17.580 --> 23:18.660]  I was like, that was some good food.
[23:18.660 --> 23:19.500]  So thank you.
[23:19.500 --> 23:20.340]  Well, thank you.
[23:20.340 --> 23:21.160]  That was awesome.
[23:21.160 --> 23:22.000]  I had to make sure to shout out your book.
[23:22.000 --> 23:22.820]  Thank you so much.
[23:22.820 --> 23:27.820]  She's also catered to like vegetarian, soy allergies,
[23:28.660 --> 23:31.020]  dairy allergies, gluten allergies.
[23:31.020 --> 23:35.020]  I mean, we have about five different food allergies
[23:35.020 --> 23:37.480]  in this house and she's managed to cater
[23:37.480 --> 23:38.660]  to every single one of them.
[23:38.660 --> 23:40.900]  Normally I won't eat at somebody else's house.
[23:40.900 --> 23:43.540]  But when she was talking to Hunt about his gluten allergy
[23:43.540 --> 23:45.420]  and she said, there's no egg in this and this.
[23:45.420 --> 23:46.780]  I was like, this lady knows what's up.
[23:46.780 --> 23:48.620]  So I totally trusted eating her food.
[23:48.620 --> 23:49.580]  It's been amazing.
[23:49.580 --> 23:50.420]  Yeah, good job.
[23:50.420 --> 23:51.260]  Thanks for feeding everybody.
[23:51.260 --> 23:52.820]  Thank you, it was super fun.
[23:52.820 --> 23:53.640]  Nice.
[23:53.640 --> 23:54.940]  I could tell you just live in the kitchen.
[23:54.940 --> 23:56.140]  You're just comfortable in there.
[23:56.140 --> 23:56.980]  Pretty much.
[23:57.020 --> 23:57.840]  It's awesome.
[23:57.840 --> 23:58.680]  I love it.
[23:58.680 --> 24:01.260]  So Britt, what do you do when you're not being a supermodel?
[24:01.260 --> 24:02.100]  Not a supermodel.
[24:02.100 --> 24:04.180]  I meant a super model, but you know what I mean.
[24:04.180 --> 24:05.020]  Thank you.
[24:05.900 --> 24:10.900]  I am the general manager for Green and Healthy Wellness.
[24:10.940 --> 24:13.740]  So I, you know.
[24:13.740 --> 24:14.820]  You manage.
[24:14.820 --> 24:16.060]  Yeah, I manage.
[24:17.700 --> 24:18.540]  Any help in the garden?
[24:18.540 --> 24:19.360]  I take care of the day to day.
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.540]  I recently started helping out in the garden.
[24:21.540 --> 24:23.660]  I have a new appreciation for the plant
[24:23.660 --> 24:26.540]  that I've been smoking for the past 10 years
[24:27.100 --> 24:29.140]  because it is a lot of work to make.
[24:29.140 --> 24:30.620]  Did you get a little sweaty in there?
[24:30.620 --> 24:32.140]  Little bit of sweaty.
[24:32.140 --> 24:37.140]  Got my hair caught in some sticky fly traps.
[24:37.140 --> 24:42.140]  And you know, sore back and sliced fingers.
[24:43.460 --> 24:45.380]  All the dudes with shaved heads are laughing at you.
[24:45.380 --> 24:47.020]  There's some battle wounds.
[24:47.020 --> 24:48.620]  It was like straight up like,
[24:48.620 --> 24:50.460]  there's something about Mary's status.
[24:50.460 --> 24:52.540]  Like my bangs just like up in the front.
[24:52.540 --> 24:53.420]  It's pretty gross.
[24:53.420 --> 24:54.260]  It was gross.
[24:55.260 --> 24:57.540]  So yeah, it was a really humbling experience
[24:57.540 --> 24:59.140]  and a really good experience.
[24:59.140 --> 25:00.700]  I've enjoyed it.
[25:00.700 --> 25:04.660]  But I really enjoy interacting with the patients most
[25:04.660 --> 25:08.060]  and you know, getting to develop relationships with them
[25:08.060 --> 25:09.740]  and building that trust.
[25:09.740 --> 25:12.000]  So that's definitely where I think,
[25:13.220 --> 25:15.460]  oh God, how long have I been in customer service now?
[25:15.460 --> 25:16.940]  How old am I?
[25:16.940 --> 25:19.820]  13 years of customer service experience
[25:19.820 --> 25:23.140]  probably serves me well in the front of the house.
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.140]  But so I do that and I'm married and I have a dog
[25:28.420 --> 25:32.900]  and we like to stay home and smoke weed and-
[25:32.900 --> 25:33.740]  Shout out to Puggle.
[25:33.740 --> 25:34.580]  Watch Netflix.
[25:34.580 --> 25:36.700]  Yeah, shout out to Penelope and Puggle.
[25:36.700 --> 25:37.860]  Make sure you follow her on Instagram,
[25:37.860 --> 25:39.260]  the sweetest dog on IG.
[25:39.260 --> 25:41.100]  She's such a diva.
[25:42.900 --> 25:45.420]  So yeah, it's been, you know,
[25:45.420 --> 25:49.660]  I just, I live the weed and Colorado lifestyle
[25:49.660 --> 25:51.900]  and I've been here since April.
[25:51.900 --> 25:56.900]  So I'm just enjoying the altitude and the mountains and-
[25:57.700 --> 25:58.540]  Welcome home.
[25:58.540 --> 25:59.380]  Thank you.
[25:59.380 --> 26:00.620]  This view here is awesome.
[26:00.620 --> 26:02.300]  It's snowing so perfectly.
[26:02.300 --> 26:03.140]  I like it.
[26:03.140 --> 26:04.220]  You guys found the greatest spot.
[26:04.220 --> 26:06.340]  I'm glad we did a podcast right here.
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.460]  All right, Ms. Shana, can I ask you what you do
[26:08.460 --> 26:11.360]  in your normal everyday life when you're not being a model?
[26:13.020 --> 26:13.860]  Photographer.
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.700]  Yeah, I'm a photographer.
[26:14.700 --> 26:16.740]  I mean, she's babely enough to be a model for sure.
[26:16.740 --> 26:17.820]  Aren't you a model, bro?
[26:17.820 --> 26:19.260]  Let's hear why you aren't the model.
[26:19.260 --> 26:20.220]  I wanna know.
[26:20.220 --> 26:21.060]  She retired.
[26:21.580 --> 26:22.420]  You retired?
[26:22.420 --> 26:23.260]  You were a model?
[26:23.260 --> 26:24.080]  Yeah, she retired.
[26:24.080 --> 26:24.920]  But not anymore?
[26:24.920 --> 26:26.620]  Yeah, she's the artiste.
[26:26.620 --> 26:27.580]  All right.
[26:27.580 --> 26:30.180]  Okay, so I bet it's much easier for you ladies
[26:30.180 --> 26:32.660]  to pose and feel comfortable in front of a lady photographer
[26:32.660 --> 26:34.020]  instead of some creepy dude.
[26:34.020 --> 26:35.700]  It's something she's very sure of.
[26:35.700 --> 26:37.340]  We love shooting with Shana.
[26:37.340 --> 26:38.180]  I can tell.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.620]  And with our past experience,
[26:39.620 --> 26:44.620]  she really, you know, shoots each photo to the model's body
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.380]  and she's really good at directing.
[26:46.380 --> 26:49.180]  And yeah, we love working with her.
[26:50.020 --> 26:52.500]  I'm so stoked about all of the shots
[26:52.500 --> 26:53.660]  that we got from this weekend.
[26:53.660 --> 26:55.220]  And we're real stoked to put out the lookbook
[26:55.220 --> 26:56.580]  because Shana killed it.
[26:56.580 --> 26:58.780]  I saw the unedited shots and the lighting is great.
[26:58.780 --> 27:00.060]  You made these ladies look great.
[27:00.060 --> 27:00.900]  Good job.
[27:00.900 --> 27:04.900]  Thanks guys for providing me with the stuff I needed.
[27:04.900 --> 27:05.740]  Yeah, girl.
[27:07.060 --> 27:08.260]  They make it look so easy.
[27:08.260 --> 27:09.300]  Miss Tristan.
[27:09.300 --> 27:10.140]  Hello.
[27:11.100 --> 27:12.500]  Wow, hi there.
[27:12.500 --> 27:14.940]  Oh, it sounds like we're gonna do some weird phone shoots.
[27:14.940 --> 27:17.500]  I'm like, I'm game.
[27:17.540 --> 27:20.180]  What do you normally do in your normal life?
[27:20.180 --> 27:22.540]  Normal life, I'm a bartender at night.
[27:22.540 --> 27:24.900]  And during the day, I hang out with my dog a lot.
[27:24.900 --> 27:26.900]  Smoke a bunch of weed, watch some Netflix and chill.
[27:26.900 --> 27:27.740]  Perfect.
[27:27.740 --> 27:28.580]  Yes.
[27:28.580 --> 27:30.980]  All right, Miss Shy Girl, I'm gonna ask you next.
[27:30.980 --> 27:33.220]  What do you do in your normal day to day life?
[27:33.220 --> 27:35.620]  I'm a bottle service girl on the weekends.
[27:35.620 --> 27:37.180]  Where do you do that?
[27:37.180 --> 27:39.740]  This bar called Barsmith and Monarch Theater.
[27:39.740 --> 27:40.740]  Oh, no, people are gonna stalk you.
[27:40.740 --> 27:42.260]  I might cut that out.
[27:42.260 --> 27:43.780]  No, I post on Instagram.
[27:43.780 --> 27:45.900]  I have to post about it too.
[27:45.900 --> 27:46.900]  So that's about it.
[27:46.900 --> 27:50.060]  And then I ride my bike and I hike.
[27:50.060 --> 27:51.380]  Your motorcycle, your Harley?
[27:51.380 --> 27:52.220]  Yes.
[27:52.220 --> 27:53.060]  Tell us a little bit about the Harley.
[27:53.060 --> 27:54.060]  I'm curious.
[27:54.060 --> 27:57.980]  It's a 2010 1200 Nightster.
[27:57.980 --> 27:59.100]  It's my first bike.
[27:59.100 --> 28:01.940]  And I've had it for just about a month now.
[28:01.940 --> 28:03.460]  Nice, it looks good on you.
[28:03.460 --> 28:04.300]  Thanks.
[28:04.300 --> 28:05.140]  It looks great on you.
[28:05.140 --> 28:06.220]  Thanks for not being shy for a minute.
[28:06.220 --> 28:08.020]  Oh, she passed the mic so quickly.
[28:08.020 --> 28:08.860]  Oh, you pulled it off.
[28:08.860 --> 28:09.700]  You nailed it though.
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.340]  You nailed it, that was perfect.
[28:11.340 --> 28:12.180]  Hey, Hunt.
[28:12.180 --> 28:14.700]  What do you do in your normal life, brother?
[28:14.740 --> 28:16.100]  What doesn't he do?
[28:16.100 --> 28:18.220]  Stealing your car.
[28:18.220 --> 28:20.420]  Besides getting his car stolen?
[28:20.420 --> 28:21.980]  Yeah, I don't really have a normal life.
[28:21.980 --> 28:24.100]  Shout out to the people that stole your car.
[28:24.100 --> 28:27.700]  Yeah, my car got stolen yesterday morning.
[28:27.700 --> 28:29.340]  Can we talk about the irony of this?
[28:29.340 --> 28:30.180]  Yeah.
[28:30.180 --> 28:31.740]  Can we just mention this irony?
[28:31.740 --> 28:33.380]  You are more than welcome to bring up the fact
[28:33.380 --> 28:36.300]  that I got paid to be a car thief model
[28:36.300 --> 28:39.140]  for the Department of Police and DMV
[28:39.140 --> 28:42.260]  about identity theft and getting your car stolen.
[28:42.260 --> 28:45.660]  And that was on every Red Rock ticket
[28:45.660 --> 28:49.580]  and every DMV department banner for like a year or so.
[28:49.580 --> 28:53.020]  So how many Facebook and Instagram and text messages
[28:53.020 --> 28:54.420]  did you get when your car got stolen?
[28:54.420 --> 28:57.540]  Well, yeah, so like five o'clock in the morning
[28:57.540 --> 29:01.140]  I started my car or whatever and these guys got it
[29:01.140 --> 29:02.540]  while I was coming out the front door
[29:02.540 --> 29:05.660]  and I chased them and all this other shit that occurred.
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.020]  And then three or four hours later we got our car back.
[29:09.980 --> 29:12.020]  So that was a...
[29:12.020 --> 29:13.060]  We're double micing him.
[29:13.060 --> 29:14.620]  Oh, I'm switching mics on the phone.
[29:14.620 --> 29:15.740]  We've got a mic on the phone.
[29:15.740 --> 29:16.580]  So sorry.
[29:16.580 --> 29:17.420]  No, you're good.
[29:17.420 --> 29:19.660]  So got the car back and all this stuff.
[29:19.660 --> 29:24.220]  I think the day yesterday, yeah, no, two days ago,
[29:24.220 --> 29:25.740]  whenever it happened on Thursday,
[29:25.740 --> 29:27.820]  I think I got about like 15 to 20 text messages
[29:27.820 --> 29:30.940]  of some sort of image of myself as a car thief
[29:30.940 --> 29:33.340]  saying that your car was easy to steal
[29:33.340 --> 29:35.500]  and taking your identity was even easier.
[29:36.580 --> 29:38.540]  And there's one that's like a really big close up
[29:38.940 --> 29:40.660]  with me and it just says like, you know,
[29:40.660 --> 29:44.020]  something about me taking your ID or some shit.
[29:44.020 --> 29:44.860]  So...
[29:44.860 --> 29:46.700]  I'm mad at myself for not making the first meme
[29:46.700 --> 29:48.020]  of that situation.
[29:48.020 --> 29:51.340]  Oh, that's all credit to dad back there.
[29:51.340 --> 29:53.180]  Yeah, that was the Terpy Boys coming through.
[29:53.180 --> 29:54.820]  The Terpy Boys pointing over here to Amanda.
[29:54.820 --> 29:55.780]  So that's a 50.
[29:55.780 --> 29:57.540]  I heard you guys complimenting each other yesterday.
[29:57.540 --> 29:58.380]  It's a 50-50.
[29:58.380 --> 30:00.100]  Yeah, he came in with the assist.
[30:00.100 --> 30:02.540]  Yeah, so, yeah, that all happened yesterday.
[30:02.540 --> 30:04.820]  I don't really have much of a regular life, I don't think.
[30:04.820 --> 30:07.220]  I mean, I have like, my real life is like, you know,
[30:07.260 --> 30:10.980]  Grimey Gatsby in four pieces and green, healthy wellness
[30:10.980 --> 30:13.140]  and the grow that, you know, you and I work at
[30:13.140 --> 30:13.980]  and the different states.
[30:13.980 --> 30:14.820]  Dude, you crush it in there.
[30:14.820 --> 30:15.660]  You know what you're doing.
[30:15.660 --> 30:16.500]  When you hired me, you're like,
[30:16.500 --> 30:17.500]  I don't know how to grow weed, I need you.
[30:17.500 --> 30:18.740]  Bro, you got it under control.
[30:18.740 --> 30:19.740]  I shouldn't tell you that too much
[30:19.740 --> 30:20.780]  because I mean, I'd be out of a job,
[30:20.780 --> 30:21.980]  but you got it under control, bro.
[30:21.980 --> 30:22.820]  You know what you're doing.
[30:22.820 --> 30:24.260]  We do an all right job over there.
[30:24.260 --> 30:25.300]  We try to keep the Terps coming.
[30:25.300 --> 30:26.140]  You look like you know how to grow weed.
[30:26.140 --> 30:27.580]  Yeah, I don't know about a real life yet.
[30:27.580 --> 30:30.260]  I think I get, I sleep from like 11 or 12
[30:30.260 --> 30:32.380]  until like five in the morning and the rest of the time,
[30:32.380 --> 30:34.340]  as you all know, my phone's on and we're going.
[30:34.340 --> 30:35.740]  You guys, there's a bed at the shop.
[30:35.740 --> 30:37.540]  If that tells you anything about life,
[30:37.540 --> 30:39.660]  there's a bed at our shop where we grow.
[30:39.660 --> 30:40.820]  Yeah, I've slept in it already.
[30:40.820 --> 30:42.220]  I've only worked there for less than a month
[30:42.220 --> 30:43.660]  and I've crashed out in that bed.
[30:43.660 --> 30:45.220]  Yeah, I don't think I can't, I can't.
[30:45.220 --> 30:47.340]  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta grind as hard as you can.
[30:47.340 --> 30:48.900]  You gotta do what you gotta do to win it.
[30:48.900 --> 30:50.940]  Yeah, we have a mattress that I grow
[30:50.940 --> 30:52.140]  in case that's necessary.
[30:52.140 --> 30:53.620]  Nice, all right.
[30:53.620 --> 30:55.100]  So I feel like we've gone about 30 minutes.
[30:55.100 --> 30:56.820]  Most people listen for about 35 minutes
[30:56.820 --> 30:57.660]  before they get burned out.
[30:57.660 --> 30:58.980]  I'll put a little intro and an ending
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.940]  at the end of this show at the start and end.
[31:00.980 --> 31:01.980]  Do you ladies have anything you wanna say
[31:01.980 --> 31:03.220]  since you got a microphone in your hand
[31:03.220 --> 31:05.060]  and a chance to say something to the world?
[31:05.060 --> 31:05.900]  Do it, shoot it in the mouth right there.
[31:05.900 --> 31:06.740]  Yeah, shout out whenever you need promo.
[31:06.740 --> 31:08.060]  Free the nipple.
[31:08.060 --> 31:09.860]  Free the nipple, all right.
[31:10.820 --> 31:11.660]  Right, yeah.
[31:11.660 --> 31:12.820]  Can we talk about your little crew?
[31:12.820 --> 31:13.940]  We all agree.
[31:13.940 --> 31:15.420]  Can we talk about your crew, like your gang,
[31:15.420 --> 31:16.900]  you're the WPC?
[31:16.900 --> 31:17.740]  Can we mention that?
[31:17.740 --> 31:19.100]  Ha ha ha.
[31:19.100 --> 31:21.180]  I got a bunch of ha ha's.
[31:21.180 --> 31:22.020]  All right.
[31:22.020 --> 31:24.620]  That's kind of a secret, but use your own imagination
[31:24.620 --> 31:26.660]  for what you think WPC could stand for.
[31:26.660 --> 31:28.740]  Yep, that's all we get out of them, guys.
[31:28.740 --> 31:30.460]  Well, ladies, thanks for letting me invade your privacy
[31:30.980 --> 31:31.820]  for a few minutes.
[31:31.820 --> 31:32.660]  I really appreciate you being on the show.
[31:32.660 --> 31:34.500]  Britt, thanks for giving me the honor
[31:34.500 --> 31:36.620]  of being the dude selected to create a stream for you.
[31:36.620 --> 31:37.820]  Yes, thank you for all your hard work.
[31:37.820 --> 31:38.900]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[31:38.900 --> 31:40.660]  Can't wait for us to find the winner.
[31:40.660 --> 31:41.900]  Yeah, we're close, you guys.
[31:41.900 --> 31:42.980]  And Team Green and Healthy,
[31:42.980 --> 31:44.300]  thanks for letting me be a part of that, you guys.
[31:44.300 --> 31:45.820]  That's awesome, I'm honored.
[31:45.820 --> 31:48.820]  Definitely, yeah, come down to West 430 Colorado Avenue
[31:48.820 --> 31:51.300]  and buy a bunch of turps and hang out and kick it
[31:51.300 --> 31:52.700]  and see the new shop.
[31:52.700 --> 31:56.420]  And soon, in like February or something,
[31:56.420 --> 31:58.500]  I think we'll have Weed by Jeff on the shelf too.
[31:58.500 --> 31:59.980]  Yeah, about February, March-ish,
[32:00.500 --> 32:01.660]  that'll be Ganja Grown by Rasta Jeff.
[32:01.660 --> 32:03.020]  You guys can always come meet Miss Damsel.
[32:03.020 --> 32:03.980]  She's there a lot.
[32:03.980 --> 32:04.820]  Come meet Damsel.
[32:04.820 --> 32:06.380]  It's 430 West Colorado.
[32:06.380 --> 32:07.420]  We'd love to see ya.
[32:08.260 --> 32:09.100]  Yeah.
[32:09.100 --> 32:10.100]  Go say hi to Haley also.
[32:10.100 --> 32:12.220]  Oh, it's medical only.
[32:12.220 --> 32:13.820]  I just went, I'm so sorry.
[32:13.820 --> 32:16.820]  All of you people that are not patients.
[32:16.820 --> 32:20.700]  But, you know, we'll expand soon and we'll see you there.
[32:20.700 --> 32:22.740]  It's coming, you guys.
[32:22.740 --> 32:24.020]  Colorado Springs has to wake up
[32:24.020 --> 32:25.340]  and let us do recreational cannabis.
[32:25.340 --> 32:26.620]  This is not cool.
[32:26.620 --> 32:27.540]  Smoke turps.
[32:27.540 --> 32:28.380]  Smoke turps.
[32:28.380 --> 32:29.700]  Turps up, piggies out.
[32:30.420 --> 32:31.260]  Uh-oh, that's starting.
[32:31.260 --> 32:32.180]  All right, well, since that's starting,
[32:32.180 --> 32:33.020]  we're gonna wrap up this one
[32:33.020 --> 32:34.980]  and we're gonna start a show with the turpy boys over there
[32:34.980 --> 32:36.940]  because Hunt's throwing the vibe now.
