[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, lost a Jeff in the house.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.500]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.500]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.500 --> 00:27.500]  Before you going back, we back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Hit it!
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  Anyways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:17.350 --> 01:21.350]  At Cannabis Community, it's time for episode number 120 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:21.350 --> 01:25.350]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.350 --> 01:28.350]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:28.350 --> 01:30.350]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.350 --> 01:34.350]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.350 --> 01:37.350]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.350 --> 01:39.350]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.350 --> 01:41.350]  I want to thank you again for joining me.
[01:41.350 --> 01:45.350]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:45.350 --> 01:47.350]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:47.350 --> 01:53.480]  Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and me.
[01:53.480 --> 01:55.480]  You guys, this episode was fun to record.
[01:55.480 --> 01:56.480]  I had a few people over.
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.480]  We had our buddy Buzzy over, we had Mike over and our good homie Sloppy was back.
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.480]  We did an episode about how to interact with law enforcement in case you're pulled over
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.480]  or in case you bump into the cops out in public or in case the cops come to your front door.
[02:08.480 --> 02:11.480]  There may be some useful advice in this one for you.
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.480]  Before we get to the podcast, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[02:15.480 --> 02:18.480]  Tonight, I'm sitting here hitting the Hitman E-Series sidecar,
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.480]  smoking some Turpex Sour Death Star, got some live resin.
[02:23.480 --> 02:25.480]  Big shout out to my friends at Hitman.
[02:25.480 --> 02:28.480]  When I buy a rig, I like to buy a rig made in America by an American.
[02:28.480 --> 02:30.480]  That's why I shop with Hitman Glass.
[02:30.480 --> 02:36.480]  Check them out at www.hitmanglass.com.

[02:39.480 --> 02:41.480]  They'll get you a rig, they'll get you a nail.

[02:44.480 --> 02:45.480]  That's my buddy Dougie.

[02:49.480 --> 02:52.480]  Chalice, hash, music, glass, and art.

[02:54.480 --> 02:56.480]  Do not miss it.
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.480]  All right, guys, that's all I've got for shout outs and advertising.
[02:59.480 --> 03:03.480]  So, I'm going to let the music play, and we're going to get into the episode
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.480]  about how to interact with law enforcement.
[03:06.480 --> 03:07.480]  Thanks for listening.
[03:14.400 --> 03:18.400]  So, what I think we have learned today is that we need to sign like an emergency contact form
[03:18.400 --> 03:20.400]  for people when they come over and take dabs,
[03:20.400 --> 03:22.400]  because I try to fuck people up over here, apparently.
[03:22.400 --> 03:24.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the show.
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.400]  Sitting to my left is our good friend, Buzzy.
[03:26.400 --> 03:27.400]  How are you doing today, my friend?
[03:27.400 --> 03:28.400]  Hey, all is well.
[03:28.400 --> 03:29.400]  Right on. Thank you for joining me.
[03:29.400 --> 03:30.400]  No problem.
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.400]  Awesome.
[03:31.400 --> 03:34.400]  Over here, kind of in front of me a little bit, off to an angle, is our good buddy, White Mike.
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.400]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[03:35.400 --> 03:36.400]  Thanks, man. Good to be here.
[03:36.400 --> 03:37.400]  Thanks for coming.
[03:37.400 --> 03:40.400]  Over here, even more in front of me, is our buddy, Sloppy.
[03:40.400 --> 03:41.400]  How are you doing, bro?
[03:41.400 --> 03:42.400]  Yo, yo. Doing well.
[03:42.400 --> 03:44.400]  Right on, man. Thanks for coming. I don't get to see you often enough.
[03:44.400 --> 03:46.400]  For sure. That's why I shot over here like that.
[03:46.400 --> 03:48.400]  Bro, Sloppy was on time, if not early.
[03:48.400 --> 03:50.400]  I was fucking impressed. Good work, bro. Thanks for coming.
[03:50.400 --> 03:51.400]  For sure.
[03:51.400 --> 03:52.400]  Awesome.
[03:52.400 --> 03:54.400]  We've got a topic that we're going to talk about tonight.
[03:54.400 --> 03:56.400]  I'm going to tell a little quick story.
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.400]  Yesterday, I was at work, and one of my trimmers, I will not say his name, just because I got respect for him,
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.400]  one of my trimmers called me, and he's like, hey, bro, can you do me a favor?
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.400]  I was like, anything for you, bro.
[04:06.400 --> 04:09.400]  He said, can you come pick me up at the fire station?
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.400]  I was like, well, what's going on?
[04:11.400 --> 04:16.400]  He said, I got pulled over, and they gave me a DUI for cannabis.
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.400]  They pulled him over.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.400]  They had probable cause to pull him over.
[04:20.400 --> 04:23.400]  When they pulled him, walked up to the car,
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.400]  the car reeked of cannabis because he's a trimmer.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.400]  I'm sure I reek of cannabis.
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.400]  Occupational hazard, yeah.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:30.400 --> 04:33.400]  So the cop was like, holy shit, you smell like cannabis.
[04:33.400 --> 04:36.400]  And my buddy was like, well, I'm a trimmer.
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.400]  And he's like, all right, well, get out of the car.
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.400]  I want to give you a sobriety test, and my buddy failed the test.
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.400]  They then put him in the cop car and took him to the fire station and drew blood.
[04:47.400 --> 04:49.400]  At that point, they called me.
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.400]  My buddy called me and said that I can come pick him up.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.400]  A couple minutes later, my phone rang.
[04:55.400 --> 04:59.400]  It was my buddy saying, hey, the state trooper just said that if you look,
[04:59.400 --> 05:02.400]  smell, or act high at all, he's going to arrest you.
[05:02.400 --> 05:05.400]  So be cool if you're coming, or I'll call somebody else.
[05:05.400 --> 05:06.400]  And I was cool.
[05:06.400 --> 05:07.400]  I hadn't smoked since.
[05:07.400 --> 05:08.400]  Fair heads up.
[05:08.400 --> 05:09.400]  Yeah, it was early.
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.400]  It was like 2 in the afternoon, and I don't even think I smoked before I went to work that day
[05:13.400 --> 05:15.400]  because I go to work too fucking early to smoke sometimes.
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.400]  Right.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.400]  So I went and smoked all day.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.400]  I was crispy.
[05:18.400 --> 05:20.400]  The only reason my eyes would be crispy is because I'd been up for too long working,
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.400]  you know, in the fucking grow room.
[05:22.400 --> 05:25.400]  So I drive over there, and I call my buddy.
[05:25.400 --> 05:26.400]  I'm like, can you come out?
[05:26.400 --> 05:27.400]  And he goes, hold on.
[05:27.400 --> 05:28.400]  The cop's going to come talk to you.
[05:28.400 --> 05:29.400]  And I was like, oh, fuck.
[05:29.400 --> 05:30.400]  He's going to come talk to me?
[05:30.400 --> 05:32.400]  And I got my couple of friends in the car from work.
[05:32.400 --> 05:35.400]  I just brought everybody with me because I didn't want to leave them there without the boss.
[05:35.400 --> 05:39.400]  So I put them in the car like a field trip for the boys and took them to the fire station.
[05:39.400 --> 05:40.400]  And I get out of the car.
[05:40.400 --> 05:41.400]  I was like, you guys stay here.
[05:41.400 --> 05:43.400]  Somebody record this.
[05:43.400 --> 05:47.400]  So a couple of the people recorded the interaction on their cell phone just in case shit went sloppy.
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.400]  Nothing went wrong.
[05:48.400 --> 05:49.400]  It was all good.
[05:49.400 --> 05:55.400]  So I walk up to the cop, and he's like, so your buddy was pulled over for DUI.
[05:55.400 --> 05:57.400]  He's too intoxicated to drive.
[05:57.400 --> 06:01.400]  I've got the opportunity to either take him to jail and keep him,
[06:01.400 --> 06:08.400]  or I can release him to a responsible adult who will declare responsibility for him for the next eight hours.
[06:08.400 --> 06:10.400]  So I know the guy.
[06:10.400 --> 06:12.400]  He's a good dude, and he's going to come work with me.
[06:12.400 --> 06:13.400]  I need him to fucking come work with me.
[06:13.400 --> 06:15.400]  He was on his way to work when he got pulled over.
[06:15.400 --> 06:17.400]  So I was like, yeah, man, I'll sign the paper.
[06:17.400 --> 06:19.400]  So the cop's like, I need your ID.
[06:19.400 --> 06:24.400]  And he took my ID and watched me write down my information as I was doing it and ran my license and shit.
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.400]  And he goes, you're not wanted.
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.400]  And I go, well, thanks.
[06:26.400 --> 06:28.400]  I've never felt more unwanted.
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.400]  Because I was sober, and it was kind of the cop.
[06:30.400 --> 06:31.400]  I want to give him a shout out.
[06:31.400 --> 06:32.400]  I don't remember his name.
[06:32.400 --> 06:36.400]  He was really fucking cool for being a state trooper that had to give my friend a DUI.
[06:36.400 --> 06:41.400]  He gave us information on how to avoid getting ourselves in trouble.
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.400]  He said stuff like, don't smell like cannabis so strongly.
[06:44.400 --> 06:48.400]  Don't smell like cannabis, have expired plates, and do these certain things.
[06:48.400 --> 06:49.400]  Right?
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.400]  He said there are 15.
[06:51.400 --> 06:52.400]  He didn't tell us what they are.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.400]  He said there are 15 things that they look for as main keys.
[06:55.400 --> 06:57.400]  And my buddy hit nine of them.
[06:57.400 --> 06:59.400]  So he definitely got arrested.
[06:59.400 --> 07:01.400]  But they let him go to me.
[07:01.400 --> 07:03.400]  The cop was really cool.
[07:03.400 --> 07:08.400]  But I've been talking about doing this episode about what to do if you're involved with law enforcement.
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.400]  I feel like my buddy handled himself well.
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.400]  He told them he worked in the industry.
[07:12.400 --> 07:14.400]  He had to have or you wouldn't have gotten that call.
[07:14.400 --> 07:15.400]  Exactly.
[07:15.400 --> 07:16.400]  Yeah, and that's that.
[07:16.400 --> 07:17.400]  And he was peaceful.
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.400]  You would have gotten a very different call.
[07:18.400 --> 07:19.400]  Yeah.
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.400]  Yeah.
[07:20.400 --> 07:21.400]  Yeah.
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.400]  If you come out of the car like, what's up, boy?
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.400]  You're arresting me.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.400]  You're not going to get the air.
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.400]  You're going to go to jail.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.400]  They didn't even tow his car.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.400]  They pulled it off to the side.
[07:27.400 --> 07:28.400]  Oh, they were extra decent about it.
[07:28.400 --> 07:29.400]  Yeah.
[07:29.400 --> 07:30.400]  Yeah.
[07:30.400 --> 07:31.400]  And they asked us a lot of questions, and I'd quit.
[07:31.400 --> 07:34.400]  When I was picking him up, the cop asked basic questions.
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.400]  And then he got friendly with us and started asking questions about the industry and work.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.400]  And at one point, I just shut up.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.400]  I was like, oh, I don't want to answer any more questions.
[07:41.400 --> 07:42.400]  He tricked me.
[07:42.400 --> 07:44.400]  He's my friend now, and I'm telling him shit.
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.400]  Dry snitching.
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.400]  Fuck off.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.400]  Right, right.
[07:47.400 --> 07:48.400]  I was like, oh, wait, no, shut up.
[07:48.400 --> 07:49.400]  Pause.
[07:49.400 --> 07:50.400]  Don't say any of this.
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.400]  I had to pull myself out of that one.
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  But it brings us to this episode.
[07:52.400 --> 07:54.400]  It's a really good way to segue into this.
[07:54.400 --> 07:59.400]  You guys, don't drive high, because they're out looking for people in Colorado right now.
[07:59.400 --> 08:00.400]  It's the start.
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.400]  This officer told us it's the start of their searching for DUI season.
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.400]  All of the state troopers have recently taken a drug expert class.
[08:08.400 --> 08:15.400]  A lot of the state troopers are now cannabis intoxication or impairment experts or whatever.
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.400]  It's where they could tell how high you are.
[08:17.400 --> 08:20.400]  And this cop said things that made me think he was serious.
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.400]  He knew stuff about my buddy being intoxicated that I know about cannabis.
[08:25.400 --> 08:26.400]  He knew that level.
[08:26.400 --> 08:32.400]  He said, your buddy doesn't look high or act high, but when I interviewed him, I can tell there are things inside of him
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.400]  that are going on that indicate that he's high.
[08:36.400 --> 08:40.400]  I was like, wow, that's kind of fucking like, I was impressed by the way that he put it.
[08:40.400 --> 08:42.400]  I'm like, all right, Jedi master.
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.400]  Right.
[08:43.400 --> 08:45.400]  Part medical training, like whatever.
[08:45.400 --> 08:46.400]  I don't know.
[08:46.400 --> 08:56.400]  But, so let's talk about some things that we could do to maybe help ourselves out and not get in as much trouble
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.400]  and maybe prevent ourselves, maybe hopefully walk away without any fucking handcuffs.
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.400]  Or maybe instead of getting all the way taken to the jail, keep yourself in a situation where they call Rasta Jeff
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.400]  and he gets to come pick you up and sign for you.
[09:08.400 --> 09:11.400]  So let's talk about like if you get pulled over.
[09:11.400 --> 09:19.400]  You've told me your method, our friend Buzzy over here, he's told me his method of how to handle himself when he gets pulled over.
[09:19.400 --> 09:24.400]  So I'm going to go around the table and I'll start with Buzzy because he's to the left.
[09:24.400 --> 09:27.400]  You're driving down the street, you're on the interstate, you're driving.
[09:28.400 --> 09:30.400]  Maybe you got a little weed in the car, but it's hidden.
[09:30.400 --> 09:31.400]  You know, it's cool.
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.400]  Oh, it's in Colorado.
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.400]  It's Colorado.
[09:33.400 --> 09:35.400]  But not all of our listeners are in Colorado.
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.400]  So a lot of these people are going to be like however many percent of them.
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.400]  Where you are is really going to depend on what you should do before you get in the car.
[09:44.400 --> 09:50.400]  Also, if you are driving with weed, regardless of where you are, you should pretty much put it in the trunk always.
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.400]  And we're in no way endorsing breaking the law.
[09:55.400 --> 09:59.400]  We're going to teach you how to be a little smarter about getting through the problem.
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.400]  This is in Colorado where it's all gravy.
[10:01.400 --> 10:02.400]  All right then.
[10:02.400 --> 10:03.400]  Yeah, okay.
[10:03.400 --> 10:04.400]  Then we'll stick with Colorado.
[10:04.400 --> 10:05.400]  This is Colorado out here.
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.400]  Yeah.
[10:06.400 --> 10:07.400]  I just feel like being a smart-ass.
[10:07.400 --> 10:08.400]  I like you.
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.400]  As you light up a big blunt.
[10:09.400 --> 10:10.400]  Let me find you an ashtray, bro.
[10:10.400 --> 10:12.400]  Just do it right here onto this table.
[10:12.400 --> 10:14.400]  I was going to ask him to do this.
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.400]  Do that then.
[10:15.400 --> 10:16.400]  I'm a guy, man.
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.400]  I'm a guy.
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.400]  I'm a dabber.
[10:18.400 --> 10:19.400]  I'm a blunt guy.
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.400]  I don't think you invented ashing into the Swisher package.
[10:22.400 --> 10:23.400]  I've done it before.
[10:23.400 --> 10:25.400]  I didn't want to just ask him to stuff.
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.400]  I appreciate you, brother.
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.400]  All right.
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.400]  Let's order in the court.
[10:28.400 --> 10:29.400]  I'm tapping the gavel.
[10:29.400 --> 10:30.400]  So you're getting pulled over.
[10:30.400 --> 10:32.400]  My buddy Buzz, you're over here.
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.400]  You're getting pulled over.
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.400]  You got those red and blues behind you.
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.400]  They're flickering.
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.400]  Bling, bling, bling.
[10:36.400 --> 10:37.400]  What am I getting pulled over for?
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.400]  Who the fuck knows?
[10:38.400 --> 10:39.400]  It's the cops, dude.
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.400]  You don't know that when you're getting pulled over.
[10:40.400 --> 10:41.400]  I'm not using your blinker.
[10:41.400 --> 10:44.400]  Being in a car and driving and just being a person.
[10:44.400 --> 10:45.400]  Sure.
[10:45.400 --> 10:46.400]  Windows are tinted.
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.400]  They don't know what color you are in there.
[10:48.400 --> 10:49.400]  They have no idea what you're doing.
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.400]  Okay.
[10:50.400 --> 10:51.400]  I don't know.
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.400]  Just pulled over.
[10:53.400 --> 10:54.400]  You don't even know yet.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.400]  So you get pulled over.
[10:55.400 --> 11:01.400]  Cop walks up to the window, shines his light right in your goddamn face, and usually he'll say something like...
[11:01.400 --> 11:02.400]  Yeah.
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.400]  I would have the window rolled down before he gets there.
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.400]  Okay.
[11:06.400 --> 11:08.400]  Your hands should be on the steering wheel.
[11:08.400 --> 11:09.400]  All right.
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.400]  Both hands on the steering wheel.
[11:10.400 --> 11:11.400]  Yeah.
[11:11.400 --> 11:12.400]  You want to be able...
[11:12.400 --> 11:13.400]  The cop should be able to see both your hands.
[11:13.400 --> 11:14.400]  This is to...
[11:14.400 --> 11:17.400]  My method is avoid anything possible.
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.400]  Be extremely what the cop wants to happen.
[11:22.400 --> 11:25.400]  Give him the most desirable situation possible.
[11:25.400 --> 11:26.400]  Be submissive to him almost.
[11:26.400 --> 11:27.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.400]  Because I'm just trying to avoid paying money to the state.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400]  Or getting shot.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.400]  That's my goal.
[11:32.400 --> 11:35.400]  So far his method and my method are very, very similar.
[11:35.400 --> 11:36.400]  Yeah, so you just keep your hands on the wheel.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.400]  He's like, license registration.
[11:38.400 --> 11:39.400]  Say, it's in my glove box.
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.400]  Can I reach into it?
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.400]  He says, sure.
[11:41.400 --> 11:42.400]  You go into it.
[11:42.400 --> 11:43.400]  You get your stuff out.
[11:43.400 --> 11:44.400]  Give it to him.
[11:44.400 --> 11:45.400]  Then, I don't know.
[11:45.400 --> 11:47.400]  Different things can happen from there.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.400]  Okay.
[11:48.400 --> 11:50.400]  So, he grabs your license.
[11:50.400 --> 11:51.400]  He's like, how you doing?
[11:51.400 --> 11:53.400]  You're like, I'm pretty good, sir.
[11:53.400 --> 11:54.400]  How about yourself?
[11:54.400 --> 11:55.400]  Probably is what...
[11:55.400 --> 11:56.400]  You're polite, dude.
[11:56.400 --> 11:58.400]  He's going to be like, license registration, proof of insurance.
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.400]  He's going to walk back to the car.
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.400]  Hopefully, he's going to come back and he's going to say, my friend Buzzy, you were going a little too fast.
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.400]  Quit driving like an asshole in these parts.
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.400]  I'm just going to give you a warning.
[12:10.400 --> 12:12.400]  Hopefully, it goes well.
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.400]  So, the key to it, I think we're all going to have the same story.
[12:16.400 --> 12:18.400]  Be polite to the cop.
[12:18.400 --> 12:20.400]  Don't try to be...
[12:20.400 --> 12:22.400]  Know your rights, but don't try to invoke them immediately.
[12:22.400 --> 12:27.400]  When the cop comes up, give him what he wants until they start fucking with you.
[12:27.400 --> 12:34.400]  The important thing to keep in mind here is that they have all the power and can execute you.
[12:34.400 --> 12:36.400]  I mean, not to fucking blunt it at all.
[12:36.400 --> 12:44.400]  99 times out of 100 or probably even more than that, you're going to get annoyed, ticketed, and sent on your way.
[12:44.400 --> 12:52.400]  But that one time out of however many, they're going to freak out and shoot you in the face or get pissed and drag you to jail.
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.400]  Or in some towns, the cops will just straight rob you and take your shit and leave you there.
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.400]  Take your shit and leave you on the side of the road.
[12:58.400 --> 13:00.400]  I want to continue. We're in the same pullover.
[13:00.400 --> 13:09.400]  That's what you got to keep in mind. Exercise your rights, but if you follow the little script they're expecting, 9 times out of 10, you're on your way in 10 minutes.
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.400]  Alright. Yeah, 10-15 minutes is as long as it takes them to run your shit.
[13:13.400 --> 13:15.400]  Alright, we're in the same pullover.
[13:15.400 --> 13:18.400]  You've gotten pulled over. You've gone through all the shit our buddy Buzzy over here has handled.
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.400]  But now when the cop comes back with your license, registration, proof of insurance, he goes,
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.400]  Hey Mike, kind of smells like you've got weed in there. I would like to search your vehicle.
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.400]  Now what's the proper response at this point?
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.400]  I don't consent to any searches, sir.
[13:32.400 --> 13:38.400]  Sloppy, do not endorse that one. We do not ever endorse running from the law enforcement unless it's in a video game.
[13:38.400 --> 13:46.400]  I do not consent to any searches. You keep repeating that when they ask you to search your stuff.
[13:46.400 --> 13:47.400]  Alright.
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.400]  They need major probable cause and they'll make shit up like you've got Altoids.
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.400]  That's probable cause because drunks use that to cover their breath.
[13:56.400 --> 13:58.400]  That's not probable cause.
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.400]  What about like myself? I work in a giant grow. I was trimming plants that were six feet tall today.
[14:03.400 --> 14:08.400]  I had to lean in between two plants and chop plants down and carry six foot tall plants.
[14:08.400 --> 14:11.400]  So am I sure I probably reek. I've got trim on me right now.
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.400]  If I was coming from work and they said, you smell like marijuana, I work in the legal marijuana industry.
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.400]  That's just a side effect of my job.
[14:17.400 --> 14:20.400]  It's probably probable cause to search my vehicle though.
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.400]  Nah, I'm sorry to jump in.
[14:23.400 --> 14:29.400]  I would say be strong on distinguishing the different smells between smoked marijuana and fresh marijuana.
[14:29.400 --> 14:33.400]  This doesn't, this, this smell that you're smelling is work related.
[14:33.400 --> 14:36.400]  This is not smoked marijuana. This is the smell of a plant.
[14:36.400 --> 14:44.400]  At this point you're like, they're arguing about smells because you're not slurring your speech because your eyes aren't red because they didn't catch you weaving.
[14:44.400 --> 14:46.400]  So I came from a...
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.400]  So don't do that shit is probably one of the things we should put on the list to avoid getting your ass in trouble.
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.400]  If you're sober right now, you can argue it.
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.400]  This is a smell that I picked up at work, working while sober.
[14:57.400 --> 14:59.400]  I'm on my way home sober.
[14:59.400 --> 15:01.400]  Like that's what you're smelling.
[15:01.400 --> 15:03.400]  I would insist on searching the car.
[15:03.400 --> 15:07.400]  Like unless they're finding roaches in the ashtray or a dab rig in the cup holder.
[15:07.400 --> 15:08.400]  And put your shit away you guys.
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.400]  Yep, you're headed on the road.
[15:09.400 --> 15:11.400]  Yeah, have it out of reach.
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.400]  Have your stuff in a, if you've got a locked container, that would be ideal.
[15:15.400 --> 15:16.400]  That's what they'd prefer.
[15:16.400 --> 15:17.400]  Keep it in the trunk.
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.400]  I think we were talking about that earlier.
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.400]  Right, it works just like booze.
[15:21.400 --> 15:25.400]  If you've got a 12 pack in the back seat of the trunk, you're fine.
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.400]  If that 12 pack is open and the 12th one is in your cup holder, half drunk, you ain't fine no more.
[15:30.400 --> 15:32.400]  Hey Puffy, you lit a blunt and you never passed it to anybody.
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.400]  What's going on with you bro?
[15:33.400 --> 15:35.400]  I've hit it four times sir.
[15:35.400 --> 15:38.400]  I figured there's only two of us smoking it.
[15:38.400 --> 15:40.400]  I'll take a puff out of that blunt.
[15:40.400 --> 15:42.400]  Turn down for what?
[15:42.400 --> 15:44.400]  I'm not going to turn down your blunt at the house.
[15:44.400 --> 15:47.400]  Thanks for coming man, I respect the blunt.
[15:47.400 --> 15:50.400]  Yeah, hey, hey, I grew this.
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.400]  That's part of why I want to smoke it.
[15:52.400 --> 15:54.400]  That's why I was sitting over there, I was like what happened?
[15:54.400 --> 15:58.400]  I guess I'm so used to some of my friends just not wanting to smoke it.
[15:58.400 --> 16:00.400]  I just sat here and faced the hills all day.
[16:00.400 --> 16:02.400]  They made me this stoned.
[16:02.400 --> 16:04.400]  They did this to me.
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.400]  Alright, so Sloppy.
[16:06.400 --> 16:07.400]  Yes.
[16:07.400 --> 16:08.400]  I want to hear about it.
[16:08.400 --> 16:09.400]  I'm a cop.
[16:09.400 --> 16:10.400]  I got the red and blue lights behind you.
[16:10.400 --> 16:11.400]  You're in the car.
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.400]  You're just cruising and you've done nothing wrong that you know of.
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.400]  Yeah.
[16:14.400 --> 16:15.400]  You pull over.
[16:15.400 --> 16:16.400]  I come up behind you.
[16:16.400 --> 16:17.400]  How do you handle yourself?
[16:17.400 --> 16:18.400]  What are you going to do?
[16:18.400 --> 16:21.400]  Okay, so two different answers.
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.400]  When I was younger, because I have two totally different perspectives on this.
[16:25.400 --> 16:26.400]  That's why I got you here.
[16:26.400 --> 16:28.400]  From being an adolescent to being an adult.
[16:28.400 --> 16:29.400]  You know what I'm saying.
[16:29.400 --> 16:30.400]  Going from young to old.
[16:30.400 --> 16:32.400]  Yeah, what I was just saying.
[16:32.400 --> 16:34.400]  Now I remember why I don't smoke blunts.
[16:34.400 --> 16:36.400]  Yeah, sorry.
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.400]  That's alright, I did it.
[16:37.400 --> 16:38.400]  I did it.
[16:38.400 --> 16:39.400]  I really appreciated that.
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.400]  Yeah, see, it was out of respect for the blunt and my homie.
[16:42.400 --> 16:44.400]  Yeah, I could die happy right now.
[16:44.400 --> 16:45.400]  No.
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.400]  Gotta have goals.
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.400]  No, okay, so when I was younger, I was one of those, oh, fuck the police, man.
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.400]  They can't do shit to me.
[16:54.400 --> 17:00.400]  I would approach the situation they pull me over and I'd be like, why'd you pull me over?
[17:00.400 --> 17:03.400]  Then I'd be really confrontational towards it.
[17:03.400 --> 17:04.400]  And then I'd go to jail.
[17:04.400 --> 17:05.400]  And that's what would happen.
[17:05.400 --> 17:08.400]  Because I was being confrontational in a scenario where I didn't need to.
[17:08.400 --> 17:10.400]  Nowadays, you comply.
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.400]  You fucking comply to everything they are asking you within reason.
[17:14.400 --> 17:17.400]  Like, oh, why were you speeding?
[17:17.400 --> 17:18.400]  This.
[17:18.400 --> 17:21.400]  Keep, like what Buzzy said, keep your hands where they can see them.
[17:21.400 --> 17:24.400]  My goal is to make the police officer feel comfortable.
[17:24.400 --> 17:28.400]  Like, as soon as they walk up to the window, that should be your best friend.
[17:28.400 --> 17:30.400]  Like, oh, those teeth are mighty white today, sir.
[17:30.400 --> 17:32.400]  You're looking real sharp in that clothes.
[17:32.400 --> 17:34.400]  Like, it's nice and sunny out, right?
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.400]  Don't say the phrase mighty white.
[17:37.400 --> 17:40.400]  Just don't say the phrase mighty white to the cops.
[17:40.400 --> 17:49.400]  All right, so without putting myself out there too much, I was driving, not high at the moment, going 15 over.
[17:49.400 --> 17:51.400]  And I had weed on me.
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.400]  This is back in North Carolina or whatever.
[17:53.400 --> 17:55.400]  And I got pulled over.
[17:55.400 --> 17:57.400]  And I had Colorado plates because I had a rental car.
[17:57.400 --> 18:00.400]  I'm going 15 over.
[18:00.400 --> 18:02.400]  And I just, I was like, fuck.
[18:02.400 --> 18:03.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.400]  Like, dude got out of the car with his cowboy hat.
[18:07.400 --> 18:09.400]  Like, he had a cowboy hat.
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.400]  And his badge was on the hat.
[18:11.400 --> 18:13.400]  He was fucking serious.
[18:13.400 --> 18:16.400]  Yeah, so what happened was I drove back to North Carolina.
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.400]  I brought a little bit of personal because I didn't want to deal with no, like, fucking ratchet shit to get weed back there.
[18:21.400 --> 18:22.400]  Fuck that.
[18:22.400 --> 18:23.400]  I got weed now.
[18:23.400 --> 18:24.400]  I actually got pulled over in Kansas.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.400]  Worst place to get pulled over ever.
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.400]  So he got out with the badge on his hat, and I was like, oh, he's going to shoot me and my dogs.
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.400]  I had two little puppies.
[18:32.400 --> 18:33.400]  So I'm nervous.
[18:33.400 --> 18:35.400]  I'm like, fuck, fuck, fuck, Colorado plates.
[18:35.400 --> 18:41.400]  And I remember right until he was in my peripherals, I was nervous, like scared.
[18:41.400 --> 18:44.400]  And as soon as he was at, I sung to him.
[18:44.400 --> 18:46.400]  I could have sung him a whole disc.
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.400]  I was so nice to him.
[18:48.400 --> 18:50.400]  And he asked me why I was speeding.
[18:50.400 --> 18:54.400]  I was like, officer, I've been driving for like eight hours.
[18:54.400 --> 18:58.400]  I saw that there's a rest area up there.
[18:58.400 --> 19:01.400]  I was honestly just trying to make it there so I can go to sleep.
[19:01.400 --> 19:02.400]  Runs my stuff.
[19:02.400 --> 19:09.400]  Now, I don't know how the police things work, but I'm pretty sure that when they run my name in any state, they can see my criminal background.
[19:09.400 --> 19:11.400]  I'm pretty sure it goes from state to state.
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.400]  So he saw that I had it.
[19:12.400 --> 19:15.400]  It's not perfect, but the bigger stuff, yes.
[19:15.400 --> 19:17.400]  Yeah, I'm sure he saw I had a record.
[19:17.400 --> 19:19.400]  And he treated me totally respectfully.
[19:19.400 --> 19:20.400]  He looked at me.
[19:20.400 --> 19:26.400]  He said, I pulled you over because you were speeding, and I wanted to really come talk to you because you're Colorado plates.
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.400]  I wanted to see if you have anything to hide from me, but obviously you don't.
[19:30.400 --> 19:31.400]  Have a good day.
[19:31.400 --> 19:32.400]  And then he left me.
[19:32.400 --> 19:34.400]  Didn't even give me the speeding ticket.
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.400]  And it's all because I was, I made him feel comfortable and I was polite.
[19:38.400 --> 19:43.400]  Because 15 over, they could take your license on the spot if they really want to be a dick.
[19:43.400 --> 19:46.400]  And we were in Kansas, and I had two pit bulls in the car.
[19:46.400 --> 19:54.400]  And after he left, I threw up because I was like, oh my God, I really thought I was going back to jail.
[19:54.400 --> 19:56.400]  And I was like, I hate life.
[19:56.400 --> 19:57.400]  They're going to take my dogs.
[19:57.400 --> 20:06.400]  But I could have handled it like when I was younger and been an asshole and got my dog shot and got fucking tasered or killed myself or thrown back in jail.
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.400]  But I was polite.
[20:07.400 --> 20:08.400]  That's what I hate.
[20:08.400 --> 20:14.400]  I hate seeing all these videos where they're like, oh, that's police abuse.
[20:14.400 --> 20:15.400]  That's police abuse.
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.400]  But the dude isn't doing what the police is asking him.
[20:19.400 --> 20:21.400]  Like, lay down on the ground.
[20:21.400 --> 20:22.400]  Lay the fuck down.
[20:22.400 --> 20:25.400]  Like, why do you want to get DDT'd?
[20:25.400 --> 20:27.400]  I just don't see the point.
[20:27.400 --> 20:28.400]  Like, they're pointing.
[20:28.400 --> 20:29.400]  Like, I saw a video.
[20:29.400 --> 20:32.400]  I saw a video.
[20:32.400 --> 20:35.400]  The police had a gun pointed at a guy.
[20:35.400 --> 20:39.400]  He had a knife, and he lunged at him, and they shot him.
[20:39.400 --> 20:41.400]  And people were like, unnecessary force.
[20:41.400 --> 20:48.400]  You're a fucking hypocrite because if you have a legal gun on you and I come and try to stab you right now, you're going to shoot me, you faggot.
[20:48.400 --> 20:51.400]  So don't fucking, don't be dating on the police.
[20:51.400 --> 20:53.400]  And when I say faggot, I don't mean gay people.
[20:53.400 --> 20:55.400]  So don't be all uptight about that.
[20:55.400 --> 20:56.400]  It's an old school version of the word.
[20:56.400 --> 20:57.400]  Yeah, for sure.
[20:57.400 --> 20:58.400]  Don't be a little fucking bitch about it.
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.400]  Don't be a little faggot.
[20:59.400 --> 21:01.400]  Like, because if I try to stab you, you're going to shoot me.
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.400]  If you say it one more time, we're going to have to do something about it.
[21:04.400 --> 21:12.400]  But no, I hate that because people are so hypocritical because if they put themselves in the same position, they would act totally different than what they're speaking.
[21:12.400 --> 21:17.400]  And I hate that because if you try to stab me, I'm shooting you if I have a legal firearm.
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.400]  Yeah, stand in front of that guy with a knife, and I'll give you half a second to decide.
[21:20.400 --> 21:21.400]  Are you going to shoot him or not?
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.400]  You're shooting him every time.
[21:22.400 --> 21:23.400]  Six or eight times.
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400]  Yeah, like what?
[21:24.400 --> 21:25.400]  Six or eight times.
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.400]  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.
[21:26.400 --> 21:28.400]  You can tell that gun goes click, click, click, click.
[21:28.400 --> 21:30.400]  The judges will be like, why didn't you shoot him 17 times?
[21:30.400 --> 21:31.400]  There was only 16 bullets.
[21:31.400 --> 21:34.400]  That was a big Lebowski reference for all the people that didn't get it.
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.400]  Click, click, click.
[21:36.400 --> 21:42.400]  The real trick here, though, is to just be calm and go through the script that they're expecting.
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.400]  And that's really easy to do if you're not doing something you're not supposed to be doing.
[21:47.400 --> 21:51.400]  But a lot of people are doing something we shouldn't be doing a lot of the time.
[21:51.400 --> 21:54.400]  Well, no, I remember how it used to be in Colorado.
[21:54.400 --> 21:57.400]  I used to have to drive and go pick up weed and drive it home all the time.
[21:58.400 --> 22:04.400]  And that was the time that I was most at risk is when I just went and picked up a new quarter and had to drive it home.
[22:04.400 --> 22:06.400]  And I made it real easy on myself.
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.400]  I threw it in a backpack when I bought it.
[22:08.400 --> 22:11.400]  I threw that backpack in the trunk when I got to the car.
[22:11.400 --> 22:18.400]  If I got pulled over on the way home, it wasn't for speeding because I did my damnedest not to break a single traffic law with weed in the car.
[22:18.400 --> 22:21.400]  But I got pulled over plenty of times with weed in the car.
[22:21.400 --> 22:26.400]  And when they walk up to your car and you go, good evening, officer, and it doesn't stink like weed in the car, you're fine.
[22:27.400 --> 22:30.400]  They go, oh, I pulled you over for this. Let me run your shit.
[22:30.400 --> 22:32.400]  Oh, here's your ticket. Have a good night.
[22:32.400 --> 22:34.400]  You show up to court, you pay that bitch, it's done.
[22:34.400 --> 22:37.400]  Quit driving 105 on I-25, Rasta Jeff.
[22:37.400 --> 22:38.400]  Right.
[22:38.400 --> 22:39.400]  Cruise control.
[22:39.400 --> 22:43.400]  I also think looking them in the eyes is key.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.400]  Yeah.
[22:44.400 --> 22:47.400]  Because if you're hiding something, you're like, yeah, be respectful.
[22:48.400 --> 22:56.400]  If you can be calm and confident, they don't wonder why you're nervous and try to figure out why you're freaking out and want to dig through your car.
[22:56.400 --> 22:59.400]  The hardest part for me is when they make you sign the ticket.
[22:59.400 --> 23:06.400]  Normally I sign my name, I get a little motion, but then you get all nervous and your shit looks like a fucking polygraph or some shit.
[23:06.400 --> 23:08.400]  You're like, I'm okay, thanks, officer.
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.400]  Right? It's all good until you look like you've got a major neurological disorder when you sign your ticket.
[23:12.400 --> 23:13.400]  Yeah, that's the best part.
[23:13.400 --> 23:17.400]  I always sign sloppy, so if that happens, I guess I don't know what I'm going to do.
[23:17.400 --> 23:19.400]  I'm just trying to sign my real name.
[23:19.400 --> 23:23.400]  You're going to end up going to jail and they're going to, uh-oh, our buddy's headphones here have taken a poo on us.
[23:23.400 --> 23:25.400]  Are they back now? Are you in business?
[23:25.400 --> 23:27.400]  Yeah, it's this connection here.
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.400]  You're going to sign sloppy one time and they're going to make that your real name.
[23:30.400 --> 23:32.400]  You're going to have to sign everything as sloppy.
[23:32.400 --> 23:33.400]  It's my alias.
[23:33.400 --> 23:34.400]  Yeah, okay.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.400]  Under the NC inmate, whatever, it says sloppy.
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.400]  Unfortunately.
[23:38.400 --> 23:39.400]  Unfortunately.
[23:39.400 --> 23:42.400]  I got arrested once and my hat said sloppy on it.
[23:42.400 --> 23:44.400]  So they take it down because it's your gang name now.
[23:44.400 --> 23:45.400]  Yeah, he brought it to me.
[23:45.400 --> 23:48.400]  He was like, I can only assume that you're sloppy, huh?
[23:48.400 --> 23:49.400]  I was like, fuck.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.400]  I also had it tatted on my arm for a while.
[23:51.400 --> 23:54.400]  Wait, you had it on your arm for a while?
[23:54.400 --> 23:55.400]  It's covered up now.
[23:55.400 --> 23:56.400]  That makes more sense to me.
[23:56.400 --> 23:57.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.400]  He was like, how did this dude have a tattoo for a while?
[23:59.400 --> 24:03.400]  I have covered all of my gang affiliation tattoos.
[24:03.400 --> 24:04.400]  Nice work.
[24:04.400 --> 24:06.400]  You're trying to be a good person now, bro.
[24:06.400 --> 24:08.400]  I'm trying not to be a target.
[24:08.400 --> 24:14.400]  One of the old heads one day looked at me and said, all that is is a bullseye for everybody that doesn't like you and the police.
[24:14.400 --> 24:17.400]  And I said, oh my God, that is genius.
[24:17.400 --> 24:22.400]  He's like, well, you walk down the street, you're just telling everybody, like, you don't need to do that.
[24:22.400 --> 24:24.400]  I was like, oh, that makes a lot of sense.
[24:24.400 --> 24:25.400]  Yep, yep, yep.
[24:25.400 --> 24:26.400]  All right.
[24:26.400 --> 24:27.400]  All right.
[24:27.400 --> 24:28.400]  So now let's move on.
[24:28.400 --> 24:29.400]  We all know what to do if you get pulled over now.
[24:29.400 --> 24:31.400]  Pull the fuck over as quickly as you can safely.
[24:31.400 --> 24:33.400]  Quickly, safely pull the fuck over.
[24:33.400 --> 24:34.400]  Keep your hands where they can see them.
[24:34.400 --> 24:35.400]  Let the cop come up.
[24:35.400 --> 24:36.400]  He's going to be like, I want your shit.
[24:37.400 --> 24:39.400]  Don't don't flirt with a female cop.
[24:39.400 --> 24:41.400]  No, that pisses her off so bad.
[24:41.400 --> 24:42.400]  Don't do it.
[24:42.400 --> 24:44.400]  Don't call her Miss Carter.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.400]  So the cop will come up.
[24:47.400 --> 24:48.400]  He'll be like, hey, what's up?
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.400]  And be like, yes, sir.
[24:49.400 --> 24:50.400]  No, sir.
[24:50.400 --> 24:52.400]  Let that interaction go smoothly.
[24:52.400 --> 24:54.400]  When they ask for your stuff, tell them you're going to reach for it.
[24:54.400 --> 24:56.400]  I'm going to reach for into the glove box.
[24:56.400 --> 24:57.400]  Ask them to reach for it.
[24:57.400 --> 24:58.400]  Ask me if you can.
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.400]  Can I reach my glove box and grab my license, registration, proof of insurance?
[25:02.400 --> 25:03.400]  I'm going to reach my pocket.
[25:03.400 --> 25:04.400]  Get my wallet out now, please.
[25:04.400 --> 25:05.400]  All right.
[25:05.400 --> 25:06.400]  So you can reach out to them, sir, and hand them your stuff.
[25:06.400 --> 25:09.400]  I recommend everybody records interactions with the police.
[25:09.400 --> 25:13.400]  As soon as you're pulled over, turn your camera phone on, place it somewhere.
[25:13.400 --> 25:15.400]  Or like, you know what I'm saying?
[25:15.400 --> 25:16.400]  Just stream it live.
[25:16.400 --> 25:17.400]  Yeah, stream it.
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.400]  Periscope.
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.400]  Periscope that shit.
[25:19.400 --> 25:20.400]  Periscope it for sure.
[25:20.400 --> 25:21.400]  For sure.
[25:21.400 --> 25:23.400]  Because then, like, yo, I mean, why not?
[25:23.400 --> 25:24.400]  At least it's there.
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.400]  I don't want everyone seeing me cry on Periscope.
[25:28.400 --> 25:30.400]  If you can, record it.
[25:30.400 --> 25:33.400]  Call my mama.
[25:33.400 --> 25:34.400]  Call my mama.
[25:34.400 --> 25:35.400]  Someone call my mama.
[25:35.400 --> 25:36.400]  I'm going to jail.
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.400]  It's an extra layer of protection for everybody.
[25:39.400 --> 25:45.400]  And if you're lucky, you live in a place where the cops have cameras stuck to their chest that they can't turn off.
[25:45.400 --> 25:46.400]  But you're not lucky.
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.400]  And then when you drive away, don't get all nervous and do something stupid.
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.400]  Right?
[25:52.400 --> 25:54.400]  Try not to peel out as you go.
[25:54.400 --> 25:55.400]  Don't celebrate too hard.
[25:55.400 --> 25:56.400]  I've done it before.
[25:56.400 --> 25:58.400]  Like, whoops, sorry, officer.
[25:58.400 --> 25:59.400]  I was nervous as shit.
[25:59.400 --> 26:00.400]  I just got away.
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.400]  I might sneeze.
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.400]  Right into the microphone.
[26:03.400 --> 26:04.400]  I was sneezing.
[26:04.400 --> 26:13.400]  Something else I was thinking about earlier today that I had to realize as an adult is not every officer is a fucking scumbag.
[26:13.400 --> 26:14.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.400]  By saying that every officer is just trying to make your day worse is basically being racist.
[26:19.400 --> 26:21.400]  It's like the same as labeling a racist doing something.
[26:21.400 --> 26:22.400]  Being a copist.
[26:22.400 --> 26:24.400]  Yeah, like, it's just jobist or some shit.
[26:24.400 --> 26:25.400]  Yeah.
[26:25.400 --> 26:28.400]  Every fast food person is going to be an asshole and every cop is trying to fuck you over.
[26:29.400 --> 26:30.400]  Because I've seen cool cops.
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.400]  I've interacted with cops who are literally just trying to do their jobs.
[26:34.400 --> 26:35.400]  I know cops that have given me.
[26:35.400 --> 26:44.400]  So when I was younger, like 24, 25-ish, my girlfriend at the time worked, managed a bar, and we would go smoke in the alley.
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.400]  There was an alleyway that went one way, and you could turn left or right to come into the parking lot of the bar.
[26:48.400 --> 26:50.400]  If you go the other way, you'll go through another area.
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.400]  This cop would roll through, and he knew we were out there just puffing all the time in that alley because you could just walk right out of the side door of the bar and go sit in this little area between you and him.
[26:57.400 --> 26:59.400]  He would come through and flash his brights.
[26:59.400 --> 27:02.400]  So we'd put our shit away and be prepared so he wouldn't have to fuck with us.
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.400]  He would just rather not see us smoking, or maybe he's got somebody else in the car.
[27:06.400 --> 27:07.400]  But not all cops are assholes.
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.400]  That guy was trying to help us out, like not have to do paperwork and fuck with us just because we want to smoke some weed.
[27:12.400 --> 27:14.400]  Oh, sorry.
[27:14.400 --> 27:15.400]  Oh, no.
[27:15.400 --> 27:17.400]  I've just had dozens of interactions with cops.
[27:17.400 --> 27:19.400]  When I was a teenager, I used to get pulled over like twice a week.
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.400]  I had a car that had really loud subwoofers in the area I grew up in.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.400]  That made me the biggest drug dealer on the planet.
[27:27.400 --> 27:28.400]  Yeah, for sure.
[27:28.400 --> 27:29.400]  I've seen that happen.
[27:29.400 --> 27:34.400]  But if you follow the script nine times out of ten, you're out of there in 15-minute stops.
[27:34.400 --> 27:45.400]  We never see, we rarely see any good shit about the cops on the news, on the Internet, on TV, anywhere like that because you rarely hear anything about the good shit.
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.400]  When people do good shit, it's like, oh, yeah, that cop helped that old lady up.
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.400]  It's his fucking job.
[27:49.400 --> 27:51.400]  You only see cop kick the guy in the face.
[27:52.400 --> 28:00.400]  That's actually, as soon as he's, in psychology class I learned about this, that's actually life, period.
[28:00.400 --> 28:12.400]  If you notice people talking about stuff a lot or even the news, it's never good stuff because even though it's unknown, you don't realize that good stuff is happening all the time.
[28:12.400 --> 28:20.400]  So that bad stuff is a blip on the radar, and that's what you remember and reference to because it's usually things are copasetic.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.400]  So when something bad happens, it really sticks out, and that's what people want to hear.
[28:23.400 --> 28:26.400]  They don't want to hear like, a hundred kids were saved today.
[28:26.400 --> 28:29.400]  They want to hear puppies getting kicked off of a cliff.
[28:29.400 --> 28:30.400]  People are fucked up, man.
[28:30.400 --> 28:33.400]  Like, they see bad stuff, and it gives them-
[28:33.400 --> 28:35.400]  Puppies getting kicked off of a cliff.
[28:35.400 --> 28:42.400]  I see like a fucking vine of six seconds of just somebody punting puppies, and it just replays over and over in my fucking head right now.
[28:42.400 --> 28:48.400]  I personally feel like people want to see bad things.
[28:48.400 --> 28:58.400]  So they have a reason to fuel an unnecessary fire to complain about why they're not doing well or to use it to why things are so fucked up, this and that.
[28:58.400 --> 29:05.400]  Like, especially like, oh man, here in America, like, we are so privileged as Americans.
[29:05.400 --> 29:07.400]  I hate this whole anti-American thing that's happening.
[29:07.400 --> 29:09.400]  Like, people standing on flags.
[29:09.400 --> 29:12.400]  If I see you standing on a flag, I'm running you over in my Prius.
[29:12.400 --> 29:13.400]  I don't give a fuck.
[29:13.400 --> 29:14.400]  Like, that's so ignorant.
[29:14.400 --> 29:15.400]  You want to know why?
[29:15.400 --> 29:16.400]  Yo, this is why.
[29:16.400 --> 29:17.400]  This is why.
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.400]  Because no one is fleeing from America.
[29:20.400 --> 29:25.400]  You are not putting your family on a door and pushing it into the ocean to get somewhere else.
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.400]  Like, America is fine.
[29:26.400 --> 29:29.400]  There's no death raids happening.
[29:29.400 --> 29:31.400]  When it's nighttime, we're in here making a podcast.
[29:31.400 --> 29:36.400]  We're not having one of us make sure that death troopers aren't coming and killing everybody in our fucking village.
[29:36.400 --> 29:37.400]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[29:37.400 --> 29:40.400]  I hate people that are like, oh, America's horrible.
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.400]  No, you're able to be the person that you want to be because you're in America.
[29:44.400 --> 29:47.400]  Because being yourself in other countries can get you fucking murdered.
[29:47.400 --> 29:49.400]  Like, as shitty as that sounds.
[29:49.400 --> 29:52.400]  This jar of weed, this is probably, what, you think that's about a half ounce?
[29:52.400 --> 29:53.400]  Yeah.
[29:53.400 --> 29:56.400]  That half ounce of weed right here in most countries would probably get your head cut off, bro.
[29:56.400 --> 29:57.400]  Thank you.
[29:57.400 --> 29:59.400]  Not most, but several.
[29:59.400 --> 30:00.400]  In a few, for sure.
[30:00.400 --> 30:01.400]  Yeah.
[30:01.400 --> 30:02.400]  Yeah.
[30:02.400 --> 30:03.400]  A lot of countries.
[30:03.400 --> 30:04.400]  Jail time in most.
[30:04.400 --> 30:05.400]  Yeah.
[30:05.400 --> 30:09.400]  We are so, like, free to do even, like.
[30:09.400 --> 30:10.400]  There are a lot of problems.
[30:10.400 --> 30:12.400]  You can't downplay that there are problems.
[30:12.400 --> 30:13.400]  No, no, no, there are.
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.400]  There are absolutely.
[30:14.400 --> 30:16.400]  No, but on the grand scheme of things, he's completely right.
[30:16.400 --> 30:19.400]  Oh, yeah, we can drive down the street and get 75 different kinds of food.
[30:19.400 --> 30:20.400]  We can drive our own vehicles.
[30:20.400 --> 30:21.400]  We can, we're all.
[30:21.400 --> 30:22.400]  Okay.
[30:22.400 --> 30:25.400]  We all, I bet everybody in this room has varying religious beliefs.
[30:25.400 --> 30:27.400]  And we, I'm not going to ask, but we could all.
[30:27.400 --> 30:29.400]  I have, like, every religious tattoo on my head.
[30:29.400 --> 30:30.400]  On one hand.
[30:30.400 --> 30:31.400]  Yeah.
[30:31.400 --> 30:32.400]  On one damn hand.
[30:32.400 --> 30:34.400]  But we could all express them by having, I've got a tattoo here.
[30:34.400 --> 30:35.400]  I've got dreadlocks.
[30:35.400 --> 30:36.400]  You've got your symbols there.
[30:36.400 --> 30:38.400]  I think I have a good idea what you follow.
[30:38.400 --> 30:41.400]  And I'm sure you two kind of link up in the same similar sort of way from conversations
[30:41.400 --> 30:42.400]  we've had.
[30:42.400 --> 30:46.400]  But in other countries, one of us would be beheaded for what we all believe.
[30:46.400 --> 30:47.400]  We'd be fighting to the death right now.
[30:47.400 --> 30:48.400]  Yeah.
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.400]  Like, raaaah, Odin.
[30:50.400 --> 30:51.400]  Like.
[30:51.400 --> 30:56.400]  At the very, very least, like, spend all day pretending like that wasn't you.
[30:56.400 --> 30:57.400]  Yeah.
[30:57.400 --> 30:58.400]  Like.
[30:58.400 --> 30:59.400]  Yeah.
[30:59.400 --> 31:00.400]  I couldn't have these dreadlocks in a lot of places.
[31:00.400 --> 31:01.400]  Yo, I.
[31:01.400 --> 31:04.400]  A lot of states, not Colorado, you'd get pulled over.
[31:04.400 --> 31:05.400]  I asked you this.
[31:05.400 --> 31:06.400]  Profiled.
[31:06.400 --> 31:08.400]  When we first met at one point, I literally asked you, like, how the fuck do you not get
[31:08.400 --> 31:10.400]  pulled over all the time?
[31:10.400 --> 31:13.400]  And it's because you don't stand out in Colorado anymore, especially not in Buffalo.
[31:13.400 --> 31:14.400]  Yeah.
[31:14.400 --> 31:16.400]  So a lot of the listeners don't realize.
[31:16.400 --> 31:20.400]  I've been told so many times that my voice doesn't match my appearance when people meet
[31:20.400 --> 31:21.400]  me.
[31:21.400 --> 31:25.400]  People, especially when I'm at the store at Green and Healthy Wellness, I'll go in, I
[31:25.400 --> 31:28.400]  buy a lot of product there, and I also deliver products sometimes.
[31:28.400 --> 31:29.400]  But.
[31:29.400 --> 31:31.400]  I don't know if I should have said that.
[31:31.400 --> 31:32.400]  I might edit that shit out.
[31:32.400 --> 31:33.400]  Beep.
[31:33.400 --> 31:34.400]  Man, back to the.
[31:34.400 --> 31:35.400]  I buy a lot of product there.
[31:35.400 --> 31:38.400]  And when I do, sometimes I bump into people that are shopping, and they're like, I recognize
[31:39.400 --> 31:40.400]  that voice.
[31:40.400 --> 31:42.400]  And they turn around and they look at me, and they're not sure if that dreadlock guy
[31:42.400 --> 31:43.400]  is the guy from the podcast.
[31:43.400 --> 31:44.400]  It's really funny.
[31:44.400 --> 31:51.400]  So the listeners that have never, that aren't privy, I guess, I'm 6'5", and I've got dreadlocks
[31:51.400 --> 31:57.400]  seriously to past my ass, like mid-thigh region, almost to my knees.
[31:57.400 --> 32:00.400]  One of the really longer ones goes almost to my kneecaps by now.
[32:00.400 --> 32:04.400]  So yeah, I feel pressure from the police sometimes.
[32:04.400 --> 32:07.400]  The cop yesterday asked me, he said, how long did it take you to get those dreadlocks?
[32:08.400 --> 32:09.400]  That long, like 11 years.
[32:09.400 --> 32:12.400]  And he goes, wow, commitment, buddy.
[32:12.400 --> 32:14.400]  That cop was cool.
[32:14.400 --> 32:19.400]  I was at the courthouse getting fingerprinted for when I worked at a dispensary.
[32:19.400 --> 32:22.400]  Everybody had to go get fingerprinted and had to go take a day off because it took them
[32:22.400 --> 32:24.400]  all fucking day to fingerprint me.
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.400]  But a cop in there walked by and he goes, great dreadlocks, bro.
[32:28.400 --> 32:30.400]  And I was like, that was a cop.
[32:30.400 --> 32:33.400]  Like that cop complimented my dreadlocks just now.
[32:33.400 --> 32:34.400]  And he meant it.
[32:34.400 --> 32:35.400]  He wasn't even being sarcastic.
[32:35.400 --> 32:37.400]  He was like, had a smile on his face and shit.
[32:37.400 --> 32:39.400]  So not all cops are cocks.
[32:39.400 --> 32:40.400]  Some cops are cool.
[32:40.400 --> 32:42.400]  But yeah, I'm a freak.
[32:42.400 --> 32:45.400]  And so sometimes I do feel some pressure from the police.
[32:45.400 --> 32:48.400]  I think all that America stuff, time is good with the police.
[32:48.400 --> 32:51.400]  Like, because that's just a big thing going on now.
[32:51.400 --> 32:55.400]  I could really just go on about America, man.
[32:55.400 --> 32:57.400]  Social media warriors and stuff.
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.400]  People who are like just bitching about the world.
[32:59.400 --> 33:04.400]  But I think that what we were just talking about earlier, like how public
[33:04.400 --> 33:06.400]  executions and all that stuff.
[33:06.400 --> 33:09.400]  Like, I think that for one hour out of the week.
[33:09.400 --> 33:10.400]  Were we talking about that?
[33:10.400 --> 33:12.400]  Yeah, we were talking about other countries being fucked up.
[33:12.400 --> 33:13.400]  Yeah.
[33:13.400 --> 33:15.400]  Mike gave me a look of like, really?
[33:15.400 --> 33:16.400]  No, I followed.
[33:16.400 --> 33:18.400]  It was just, we're all high and this is awesome.
[33:18.400 --> 33:20.400]  It was a sharp left.
[33:20.400 --> 33:22.400]  This conversation is brought to you by marijuana.
[33:22.400 --> 33:24.400]  Brought to you by marijuana.
[33:24.400 --> 33:25.400]  Bong.
[33:25.400 --> 33:29.400]  I think that everybody should be made to watch one hour of what's really
[33:29.400 --> 33:31.400]  going on in other countries.
[33:31.400 --> 33:32.400]  Like a week.
[33:32.400 --> 33:35.400]  One hour a week of like, show me like what's up in Mexico.
[33:35.400 --> 33:36.400]  Show me what's up in Egypt.
[33:36.400 --> 33:38.400]  Like show you what's really fucked up.
[33:38.400 --> 33:39.400]  Because.
[33:39.400 --> 33:40.400]  That would be a great idea.
[33:40.400 --> 33:42.400]  But I think it's all about the source.
[33:42.400 --> 33:44.400]  Where are you going to get that material?
[33:44.400 --> 33:46.400]  The fucking internet has all of it.
[33:46.400 --> 33:50.400]  It has people being publicly executed by the.
[33:50.400 --> 33:52.400]  But does it have the good also?
[33:52.400 --> 33:54.400]  Does it have the good as well as the bad?
[33:54.400 --> 33:55.400]  Well, yeah, no, no, no, no.
[33:55.400 --> 33:56.400]  What I'm saying is every,
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.400]  I was just referencing to the fact that people bitch about America so much.
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.400]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[34:01.400 --> 34:02.400]  Okay.
[34:02.400 --> 34:04.400]  We are really okay here.
[34:04.400 --> 34:06.400]  Like I got, I just went to Cali.
[34:06.400 --> 34:07.400]  Cali was awesome.
[34:07.400 --> 34:08.400]  First time ever in Cali.
[34:08.400 --> 34:09.400]  Amazing.
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.400]  Shout out to Cali.
[34:10.400 --> 34:13.400]  I think someone like Cali.
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.400]  But I got into a debate with my friend there because she's like an active
[34:18.400 --> 34:20.400]  feminist and stuff, which I support.
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.400]  That's awesome.
[34:21.400 --> 34:24.400]  But she said that like women don't have a lot of rights here and they're
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.400]  really restrained and so on and so forth, which in some ways I do see,
[34:28.400 --> 34:30.400]  like statistically they get paid less and stuff.
[34:30.400 --> 34:31.400]  I understand.
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.400]  But as far as freedoms of the world, women are really free in America.
[34:35.400 --> 34:38.400]  And I hate to say it, but like in other countries,
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.400]  women are still getting stoned to death for talking to males in public.
[34:43.400 --> 34:45.400]  And we got women running for president.
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.400]  So like, yes, things are different, but like we are,
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.400]  we are far the advanced in a lot of ways.
[34:51.400 --> 34:54.400]  Like, I don't know if that sounds like weird to say, but like.
[34:54.400 --> 34:56.400]  How can people find you on Twitter?
[34:56.400 --> 34:58.400]  Sloppy 919.
[34:58.400 --> 34:59.400]  Angry tweet me if you want to.
[34:59.400 --> 35:00.400]  I want to hear everything.
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.400]  Make sure all of the tweets about the anti-feminism statements are headed
[35:04.400 --> 35:05.400]  towards sloppy.
[35:05.400 --> 35:07.400]  Whoa, I didn't say anything about anti.
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.400]  I've said I'm totally for it.
[35:09.400 --> 35:12.400]  There were some microaggressions.
[35:12.400 --> 35:14.400]  And then.
[35:14.400 --> 35:16.400]  I feel like it was just a statement.
[35:16.400 --> 35:17.400]  Just in the.
[35:17.400 --> 35:19.400]  Almost swallowed your whole float.
[35:19.400 --> 35:20.400]  When I said the word microaggression.
[35:20.400 --> 35:21.400]  It was funny.
[35:21.400 --> 35:23.400]  That's a new word for this.
[35:23.400 --> 35:25.400]  Stand up for whoever you are.
[35:25.400 --> 35:26.400]  I believe in like,
[35:27.400 --> 35:31.400]  I also think that I think it's up that it's up to be proud of your
[35:31.400 --> 35:32.400]  heritage nowadays.
[35:32.400 --> 35:35.400]  Like, like, no, or no, nobody really does.
[35:35.400 --> 35:37.400]  And nobody's like, I'm Italian and.
[35:37.400 --> 35:39.400]  Like nobody's with their roots.
[35:39.400 --> 35:42.400]  Nobody wants to be guilty of cultural appropriation.
[35:42.400 --> 35:43.400]  Right. Right.
[35:43.400 --> 35:45.400]  It's a step away from being racist.
[35:45.400 --> 35:49.400]  It's almost, it's a foot into the racist category, which it isn't.
[35:49.400 --> 35:53.400]  But then again, racism is, isn't it just having pride in one's race?
[35:53.400 --> 35:55.400]  Isn't bigotry the real problem?
[35:55.400 --> 35:56.400]  Like, or something like that?
[35:56.400 --> 36:00.400]  Like, cause like it's, I feel like it's, it's a thing.
[36:00.400 --> 36:02.400]  Like, it shouldn't be a thin line.
[36:02.400 --> 36:04.400]  Like everybody should be proud of who they are.
[36:04.400 --> 36:06.400]  Like if you're German, be proud, you're German.
[36:06.400 --> 36:08.400]  If you're black, be proud, you're black.
[36:08.400 --> 36:10.400]  If you're, if you're Asian, you know what I'm saying?
[36:10.400 --> 36:13.400]  Like, but it's when you add hate to it, like, oh,
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.400]  I don't like these other people.
[36:14.400 --> 36:15.400]  Cause they're not.
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.400]  Yeah.
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.400]  But I, I think that it's misinterpreted a lot.
[36:19.400 --> 36:21.400]  Like.
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.400]  People just see what they want to see, like straight up.
[36:23.400 --> 36:25.400]  You could take any story and make it good or bad.
[36:25.400 --> 36:32.400]  And by changing like minor details, altering shit, I've seen them do it.
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.400]  Two people can read the same book and get totally different stories.
[36:36.400 --> 36:40.400]  Two people can watch the same car accident and tell two totally different stories.
[36:40.400 --> 36:42.400]  Perspective is a damn thing.
[36:42.400 --> 36:43.400]  Yep.
[36:43.400 --> 36:44.400]  And watch the same fight.
[36:44.400 --> 36:46.400]  Have two totally different stories.
[36:46.400 --> 36:47.400]  Both people won.
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.400]  Yeah.
[36:48.400 --> 36:49.400]  Yeah.
[36:49.400 --> 36:50.400]  You can tell it.
[36:50.400 --> 36:51.400]  Mike beat the shit out of Jeff and you'll be like,
[36:52.400 --> 36:53.400]  Jeff beat the shit out of Mike.
[36:53.400 --> 36:54.400]  He was stomping them.
[36:54.400 --> 36:55.400]  Mike had him the whole time.
[36:55.400 --> 36:56.400]  I've heard stuff like that.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.400]  Like back in school.
[36:57.400 --> 36:58.400]  Shit.
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.400]  Like both people went up.
[36:59.400 --> 37:00.400]  I won't.
[37:00.400 --> 37:01.400]  Well, who won then?
[37:01.400 --> 37:03.400]  Y'all just like everybody is, is, is a Hulking Superman here.
[37:03.400 --> 37:06.400]  All right, guys, we got way off course here, but I like it.
[37:06.400 --> 37:07.400]  It's fun.
[37:07.400 --> 37:08.400]  The America stuff.
[37:08.400 --> 37:10.400]  I tried to squeeze it in America.
[37:10.400 --> 37:11.400]  Fuck.
[37:11.400 --> 37:12.400]  Yeah.
[37:12.400 --> 37:13.400]  When we ramble, they do hashtag.
[37:13.400 --> 37:14.400]  I like it when you ramble.
[37:14.400 --> 37:15.400]  So.
[37:15.400 --> 37:18.400]  Talking about what to do.
[37:18.400 --> 37:20.400]  If you get pulled over by the police guys, behavior.
[37:21.400 --> 37:22.400]  Don't reach too quickly.
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.400]  We all saw the video of the guy that reached into his car to get his ID.
[37:25.400 --> 37:26.400]  I got blasted by the police.
[37:26.400 --> 37:28.400]  Don't reach so quickly.
[37:28.400 --> 37:29.400]  Just chill out.
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.400]  Ask him, chill out, chill out, try to try to get a good recording.
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.400]  Whoever said that as a genius.
[37:33.400 --> 37:35.400]  Sloppy high five.
[37:35.400 --> 37:37.400]  Since you got your hand up, I'm sure I five you.
[37:37.400 --> 37:38.400]  There you go.
[37:38.400 --> 37:39.400]  High five on a record it.
[37:39.400 --> 37:40.400]  All right.
[37:40.400 --> 37:41.400]  So how about if we're sitting here?
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.400]  Mike, I'm going to know what I'm going to ask you.
[37:45.400 --> 37:46.400]  I want, let's go Mike.
[37:46.400 --> 37:47.400]  First.
[37:47.400 --> 37:48.400]  This is your house.
[37:48.400 --> 37:49.400]  Let's say I just gave you the house.
[37:49.400 --> 37:50.400]  I'm sitting here.
[37:50.400 --> 37:51.400]  Doorbell rings.
[37:51.400 --> 37:52.400]  And it not even doorbell.
[37:52.400 --> 37:53.400]  It's this one.
[37:53.400 --> 37:54.400]  It's fucking this sound.
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.400]  The cop.
[37:56.400 --> 37:59.400]  We all, everybody's heart sinks when you hear that shit.
[37:59.400 --> 38:03.400]  If your pizza boy is not like that, right?
[38:03.400 --> 38:04.400]  Like don't take the guy.
[38:04.400 --> 38:05.400]  Don't knock like that.
[38:05.400 --> 38:07.400]  We all know right away.
[38:07.400 --> 38:08.400]  Like, Oh, sure.
[38:08.400 --> 38:09.400]  It's the police.
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.400]  What are you going to do?
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.400]  How do you handle that?
[38:11.400 --> 38:17.400]  Take a quick look around the room and make sure there's nothing laying there
[38:18.400 --> 38:19.400]  that I wouldn't want laying out.
[38:19.400 --> 38:22.400]  That's just a habit from back when we was illegal here.
[38:22.400 --> 38:23.400]  Right.
[38:23.400 --> 38:24.400]  And it's a good tip for anybody that's not in Colorado.
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.400]  I shouldn't have knocked so hard on the fucking table.
[38:26.400 --> 38:27.400]  Right.
[38:27.400 --> 38:28.400]  Ridiculous.
[38:28.400 --> 38:30.400]  It's I don't know how cops knock like that repeatedly.
[38:30.400 --> 38:32.400]  Like, is that why they're annoyed when I opened the door?
[38:32.400 --> 38:33.400]  Cause their fucking hand.
[38:33.400 --> 38:36.400]  Rubbing their hand on their jeans all like, fuck this sucks.
[38:36.400 --> 38:37.400]  It broke my knuckle.
[38:37.400 --> 38:38.400]  Right.
[38:38.400 --> 38:40.400]  Um, so open the door.
[38:40.400 --> 38:43.400]  Um, good, you know, good evening officer.
[38:43.400 --> 38:44.400]  What can I do for you?
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.400]  Um, and then see what they've got to say at that point.
[38:48.400 --> 38:53.400]  Like nine times out of 10, if they were there and you were in real trouble,
[38:53.400 --> 38:56.400]  they would have knocked like your door would have exploded.
[38:56.400 --> 38:59.400]  A flashback would have gone off and you'd have an M 16 point is your head.
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.400]  Um, if they're knocking, they just want to ask questions.
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.400]  And so you just, if you're not interested, say you're not interested,
[39:07.400 --> 39:11.400]  come back with a warrant and politely at the conversation and step back
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.400]  inside. Um, if they're like asking about something that happened up the street
[39:16.400 --> 39:17.400]  or whatever, and you want to talk to them,
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.400]  step out onto the porch and pull the door shut behind you,
[39:22.400 --> 39:23.400]  sit there and have the conversation.
[39:24.400 --> 39:25.400]  Should you almost lock yourself out?
[39:27.400 --> 39:28.400]  Unnecessary.
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.400]  All right. They can't open the door and call in for any reason.
[39:31.400 --> 39:32.400]  Not legally.
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.400]  We're at a warrant like without probable cause that like there's a crime being
[39:37.400 --> 39:39.400]  committed inside or that somebody is in distress.
[39:39.400 --> 39:42.400]  So what if the cop says, well, Mike,
[39:43.400 --> 39:44.400]  I'd like to take a look inside.
[39:45.400 --> 39:46.400]  Why?
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.400]  Because we believe you did it.
[39:50.400 --> 39:51.400]  Did what?
[39:51.400 --> 39:52.400]  The thing that we're here to accuse you of.
[39:53.400 --> 39:54.400]  I know. Come back.
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.400]  I'd like to look inside. Mike.
[39:58.400 --> 40:01.400]  I'd like to go inside and shut the door and continue on my evening officer.
[40:01.400 --> 40:03.400]  If you don't have a warrant, please come back later with one.
[40:03.400 --> 40:05.400]  If you don't have anything to hide, Mike,
[40:05.400 --> 40:07.400]  there shouldn't be a problem with us coming in and taking a look.
[40:07.400 --> 40:08.400]  Don't you think?
[40:08.400 --> 40:09.400]  I got stuff to do. Have a nice night.
[40:10.400 --> 40:12.400]  All right, Mike. Thanks for, thanks for playing along.
[40:13.400 --> 40:14.400]  Do you fucking win? Would you like a dab?
[40:15.400 --> 40:16.400]  Like it's a lot scarier.
[40:17.400 --> 40:18.400]  I'm serious. Would you like a dab?
[40:19.400 --> 40:20.400]  A really small one.
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.400]  Cause you won. He played that perfectly.
[40:23.400 --> 40:24.400]  All the right answers over there.
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.400]  It's you've got a lot of rights in knowing how to exercise them is key.
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.400]  Grab a pen or type flex your rights.com.
[40:35.400 --> 40:36.400]  I think it is.
[40:36.400 --> 40:37.400]  Or just Google flex your rights.
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.400]  It's a series of videos put on by a defense attorney out of Baltimore.
[40:42.400 --> 40:44.400]  Um, who's really fun to watch on video.
[40:45.400 --> 40:47.400]  And it's really nice to know exactly what to do when you run into law enforcement.
[40:48.400 --> 40:49.400]  Google flex your rights.
[40:50.400 --> 40:51.400]  Flex your rights.
[40:52.400 --> 40:53.400]  Oh, we should have gone there before we did this.
[40:54.400 --> 40:55.400]  We should have read that.
[40:56.400 --> 40:57.400]  It's a, it's awesome.
[40:58.400 --> 40:59.400]  I meant to review it before I came over, but I got a kid now.
[41:00.400 --> 41:02.400]  Try not to. Yeah, there you go.
[41:03.400 --> 41:04.400]  Don't dab the microphone.
[41:04.400 --> 41:06.400]  I read something the other day that says that, uh,
[41:07.400 --> 41:12.400]  undercover vehicles cannot operate normal traffic stops in Colorado.
[41:13.400 --> 41:14.400]  Do you know if that's true or not?
[41:15.400 --> 41:17.400]  I saw a Chevy Tahoe ish looking vehicle.
[41:18.400 --> 41:19.400]  I don't want to be certain on the Tahoe.
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.400]  It looked like a Tahoe, uh, pull somebody over on I-25 the other day while I was in Denver.
[41:25.400 --> 41:26.400]  Yeah. Yeah. I have,
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.400]  I have somebody who works at the Honda dealership that said that he got pulled over by undercover and they said,
[41:31.400 --> 41:32.400]  uh, you don't have insurance.
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.400]  And he said, you're not supposed to be pulling people over in this vehicle.
[41:37.400 --> 41:38.400]  And they let him go.
[41:39.400 --> 41:41.400]  But I, you know, I know I don't never believe a hundred percent what people say.
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.400]  So I was trying to, and he was a car dealer.
[41:45.400 --> 41:46.400]  No, he just, he's a mechanic.
[41:47.400 --> 41:49.400]  Okay. I was going to say, if he's a car dealer, he already loses a little bit of credibility.
[41:50.400 --> 41:51.400]  You want me to turn your mic up over there, Mike?
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.400]  I'm just going to let him die right on my, take your baby.
[41:57.400 --> 41:58.400]  Baby lungs, Mike, don't smoke cigarettes.
[41:59.400 --> 42:00.400]  You guys are, you'll end up sounding like that.
[42:01.400 --> 42:02.400]  That's exactly what that is.
[42:03.400 --> 42:04.400]  We're going to have an intervention.
[42:05.400 --> 42:08.400]  One day we're going to tell him we're having a podcast and this is going to be an intervention.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.400]  Um, the fuck we're just talking about.
[42:12.400 --> 42:13.400]  I was watching tribute.
[42:14.400 --> 42:15.400]  Then I coughed.
[42:16.400 --> 42:17.400]  I'm going to quiz sloppy sloppy.
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.400]  All right, here we go.
[42:20.400 --> 42:21.400]  We're at your house.
[42:22.400 --> 42:23.400]  It's the cops.
[42:24.400 --> 42:25.400]  You open the door.
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.400]  I'm putting my dog somewhere where they can't act aggressive towards the police because fuck that.
[42:32.400 --> 42:33.400]  Like they will shoot your fucking dog.
[42:34.400 --> 42:39.400]  And honestly, like not trying to sound like crazy or nothing, but if they shoot my dogs in front of me, I'm catching some charges because I'm swinging.
[42:40.400 --> 42:41.400]  No regrets.
[42:42.400 --> 42:43.400]  No doubt.
[42:44.400 --> 42:45.400]  I am beast moding that.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.400]  Dogs look fucking scary as shit.
[42:48.400 --> 42:49.400]  And they're so lovable, but they're 90 pounds of pit bulls.
[42:50.400 --> 42:53.400]  So I understand, like sometimes I forget that they're like that because people are like, Oh my God.
[42:53.400 --> 42:54.400]  I'm like, what?
[42:55.400 --> 42:56.400]  Get in their face, bro.
[42:57.400 --> 42:58.400]  You're right.
[42:59.400 --> 43:00.400]  I cuddle with those dogs.
[43:01.400 --> 43:02.400]  I sleep in my bed every night.
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.400]  But yeah, no, I'm putting my dogs up and then I, I'm going to answer the door.
[43:05.400 --> 43:08.400]  As soon as I see that it's the authorities, I am stepping out and closing the door.
[43:09.400 --> 43:12.400]  Like I, when you said that, that's exactly, I don't want them looking in my house.
[43:13.400 --> 43:14.400]  I don't want them to have reason.
[43:15.400 --> 43:16.400]  Like, Oh, I saw this on the table.
[43:17.400 --> 43:18.400]  Shut the door.
[43:19.400 --> 43:21.400]  So that, that, that while one of them talks to the other one searches as much of your house as he can.
[43:21.400 --> 43:22.400]  Be lurking around.
[43:23.400 --> 43:24.400]  Oh, there's a grinder on the table or so.
[43:25.400 --> 43:26.400]  I don't want none of that shit.
[43:27.400 --> 43:28.400]  Get out, shut the door.
[43:29.400 --> 43:30.400]  Why are you here?
[43:31.400 --> 43:32.400]  Always be polite.
[43:33.400 --> 43:34.400]  I contact, uh, I guess.
[43:35.400 --> 43:36.400]  Yeah.
[43:36.400 --> 43:37.400]  Be the hands out of your pockets.
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.400]  Yeah, for sure.
[43:40.400 --> 43:41.400]  That's, that's a key.
[43:42.400 --> 43:43.400]  Don't have your hands.
[43:44.400 --> 43:45.400]  All right, here's the ultimate question.
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.400]  Well, uh, Mr.
[43:48.400 --> 43:49.400]  Sloppy, I'd like to come inside and take a look.
[43:49.400 --> 43:52.400]  Uh, I really don't know what you're talking about.
[43:53.400 --> 43:54.400]  You did the crime that we're here to invent.
[43:55.400 --> 43:56.400]  That we're here to invent.
[43:57.400 --> 44:00.400]  That's all I mean, that's, you know, that's how it's kind of feels most of the time.
[44:01.400 --> 44:02.400]  Nah, yeah.
[44:03.400 --> 44:04.400]  If they don't have a warrant, don't, don't let them do anything.
[44:05.400 --> 44:06.400]  Don't let them fucking in your house.
[44:07.400 --> 44:08.400]  Yeah.
[44:08.400 --> 44:14.400]  And, and honestly, from, from past experience, even if they have a warrant, they're going to do whatever the fuck they want.
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.400]  Cause the one time I was arrested was this exact scenario.
[44:19.400 --> 44:20.400]  I will not exact.
[44:20.400 --> 44:21.400]  I stepped out of the house.
[44:22.400 --> 44:23.400]  I went to the gas station to get a Dutch.
[44:24.400 --> 44:25.400]  I was with my friend Julian.
[44:26.400 --> 44:27.400]  I think I've told this shot at the Julian.
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.400]  Yeah.
[44:29.400 --> 44:30.400]  Yeah.
[44:30.400 --> 44:31.400]  Shout out to killer Jules and see he makes beats.
[44:32.400 --> 44:33.400]  Uh, day God.
[44:34.400 --> 44:36.400]  But no, I think I've told this story on the cast before we, we, we pulled up to the gas station.
[44:37.400 --> 44:40.400]  It's like half a mile from the house and mad cops swarm the car and, uh, get out.
[44:41.400 --> 44:43.400]  And they're like full tactical gear and stuff.
[44:44.400 --> 44:47.400]  And, uh, they're yelling at Julian and I was like, Oh, mistaken identity.
[44:48.400 --> 44:49.400]  I literally thought that.
[44:50.400 --> 44:53.400]  And then they looked at me and said my government name and, uh, they had the warrant.
[44:54.400 --> 44:55.400]  They showed me the warrant.
[44:55.400 --> 44:56.400]  I read it.
[44:56.400 --> 44:57.400]  I was in handcuffs.
[44:57.400 --> 44:58.400]  I looked through it.
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.400]  Uh, I lived in a third story apartment one way in, one way out, told them the door was unlocked, said my girlfriend's in there with my dog.
[45:04.400 --> 45:05.400]  Go ahead.
[45:05.400 --> 45:06.400]  Just go in.
[45:06.400 --> 45:07.400]  Like you already have all the paperwork.
[45:07.400 --> 45:08.400]  It's cool.
[45:09.400 --> 45:10.400]  They went up there and still busted out every window.
[45:11.400 --> 45:14.400]  Flash banged my girlfriend, tasered the dog and knocked the door in.
[45:15.400 --> 45:18.400]  And, and I told them where everything was and they cut my cushions open, broke my fridge.
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.400]  Uh, they found half a gram of marijuana, a bong and an unregistered firearm.
[45:25.400 --> 45:26.400]  I wasn't 21 yet.
[45:26.400 --> 45:27.400]  I was three months away.
[45:27.400 --> 45:28.400]  Uh, and that was it.
[45:29.400 --> 45:32.400]  And I told them the door was unlocked to go inside and they still blew that shit up.
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.400]  Like, yeah.
[45:35.400 --> 45:37.400]  So, uh, if they have the warrant, fuck you.
[45:37.400 --> 45:39.400]  If they don't have the warrant, get the fuck out of my face.
[45:39.400 --> 45:40.400]  Like, leave me alone.
[45:41.400 --> 45:42.400]  If they've got the warrant, they're pretty much doing what they want to do.
[45:43.400 --> 45:44.400]  They didn't knock anyway.
[45:44.400 --> 45:45.400]  They booted in that fucking door.
[45:46.400 --> 45:48.400]  What it was, was they planned on doing that to me anyway.
[45:48.400 --> 45:51.400]  And then I went to the store and he was like, oh, he took all the fun out of it.
[45:51.400 --> 45:52.400]  Fuck it.
[45:52.400 --> 45:53.400]  Like, yeah, yeah.
[45:53.400 --> 45:54.400]  We had all of our toys polished.
[45:55.400 --> 45:56.400]  We wanted to come play with our toys.
[45:56.400 --> 45:57.400]  All right.
[45:57.400 --> 45:59.400]  So we all know what to do now.
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.400]  If the cops come to the door, step outside, talk to him, be kind, keep your hands where they can see him.
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.400]  Uh, if, if a cop asks for your ID, you do not have to present ID, but it helps with the interaction.
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.400]  If you want to keep on that, like polite, like I don't want to go to jail side.
[46:14.400 --> 46:15.400]  Compliance.
[46:15.400 --> 46:16.400]  Just give me a fucking ID.
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.400]  If you're not hiding anything, you can, you can flex your rights and be like, I don't have to give you my ID.
[46:20.400 --> 46:22.400]  But it's just kind of being a dick.
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.400]  There are a lot of YouTube videos where you can really learn your rights.
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.400]  And some people really enjoy pulling the, am I detained?
[46:32.400 --> 46:33.400]  Am I free to go?
[46:33.400 --> 46:34.400]  That's a good rapid fire.
[46:34.400 --> 46:36.400]  That's where I'm headed with this.
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.400]  There are YouTube channels that are solely dedicated to people harassing police officers.
[46:40.400 --> 46:41.400]  Yeah.
[46:41.400 --> 46:44.400]  Walking down the street with assault rifles just to get a rile out of the police.
[46:44.400 --> 46:45.400]  Like, sir, what are you doing?
[46:45.400 --> 46:47.400]  I can be here because of HB 41.
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.400]  Me and my nunchucks and samurai sword and butt ass naked are fairly legal right now.
[46:55.400 --> 47:09.400]  Well, no, depending on where you live in the U S like along our Southern states, uh, anything bordering Mexico, they've got random highway checkpoints where they look for immigration documents and all kinds of shit.
[47:09.400 --> 47:14.400]  And a lot of that's unconstitutional and it really pisses people off.
[47:15.400 --> 47:29.400]  And so people who know exactly how to flex their rights in a very specific way, risk giving the living shit beaten out of them and thrown in jail and go flex their rights at fucking massive checkpoints and stuff.
[47:29.400 --> 47:30.400]  And it's nuts.
[47:30.400 --> 47:36.400]  But, uh, exactly how to do that makes getting pulled over really easy to handle.
[47:37.400 --> 47:40.400]  Like you stay calm and keep your hands in plain sight.
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.400]  You ask him what is your info out of the glove box?
[47:43.400 --> 47:44.400]  What if you're walking down the street?
[47:44.400 --> 47:50.400]  What if you're just down on fucking fourth street, walking from one store to the other, it's kind of fucking dark out.
[47:50.400 --> 47:52.400]  The cop walks up to you and he's like, Hey, you come here.
[47:52.400 --> 47:53.400]  I want to talk to you.
[47:53.400 --> 47:56.400]  A cop just walks out of nowhere or he comes from somewhere specific.
[47:56.400 --> 47:59.400]  He there's a manhole.
[47:59.400 --> 48:01.400]  He's a rapist.
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.400]  Manhole smoothly slid over on the cop elevated slowly out of it.
[48:08.400 --> 48:09.400]  No, that means the devil.
[48:11.400 --> 48:12.400]  Or a Ninja turtle.
[48:12.400 --> 48:13.400]  Ninja turtle.
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  All right.
[48:14.400 --> 48:16.400]  You don't know where he came from.
[48:16.400 --> 48:17.400]  You're in conversation.
[48:17.400 --> 48:18.400]  You and I were talking.
[48:18.400 --> 48:19.400]  We're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[48:19.400 --> 48:20.400]  Cop pops up, bumps into us.
[48:20.400 --> 48:21.400]  Excuse me, boys.
[48:21.400 --> 48:22.400]  I'd like to talk to you.
[48:23.400 --> 48:24.400]  How can I help you, officer?
[48:24.400 --> 48:25.400]  Hey, what's up, sir?
[48:25.400 --> 48:26.400]  What's going on?
[48:26.400 --> 48:27.400]  I'd like to see your ID.
[48:27.400 --> 48:28.400]  You reach in your pocket, hand him your ID.
[48:29.400 --> 48:30.400]  Yeah, sure.
[48:30.400 --> 48:31.400]  All right.
[48:31.400 --> 48:32.400]  Sure.
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.400]  If I'm just standing there and it's not harassing me or anything.
[48:34.400 --> 48:37.400]  That question depends what other items are on my person.
[48:38.400 --> 48:39.400]  I was just about to say that.
[48:39.400 --> 48:40.400]  Well, that's where I'm headed next.
[48:40.400 --> 48:41.400]  Looks like you guys were.
[48:41.400 --> 48:43.400]  We saw you guys smoking some weed back there when you were walking.
[48:44.400 --> 48:45.400]  No, you didn't.
[48:46.400 --> 48:49.400]  Well, I saw you and you fucking reek like weed.
[48:50.400 --> 48:51.400]  It's an opinion, not a fact, sir.
[48:52.400 --> 48:53.400]  Okay.
[48:53.400 --> 48:54.400]  I like the way you're going with this.
[48:54.400 --> 48:55.400]  That would probably give me a hit on the stick.
[48:55.400 --> 48:56.400]  Yeah.
[48:56.400 --> 48:57.400]  Yeah.
[48:57.400 --> 48:58.400]  Yeah.
[48:58.400 --> 48:59.400]  That's what I was going to say.
[48:59.400 --> 49:00.400]  Right now, I'm going to mace you, tase you, and hit you with something,
[49:00.400 --> 49:01.400]  and then put you in the car.
[49:01.400 --> 49:02.400]  That's my perfume.
[49:02.400 --> 49:06.400]  That was the one and only benefit ever to smoking cigarettes is that's what I always smelled like.
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.400]  And I could like point to you.
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.400]  I could point to the cigarettes in my pocket and be like, no, sir, Marlboro.
[49:13.400 --> 49:14.400]  And they'd go, oh.
[49:15.400 --> 49:18.400]  And then the line of questioning would change like instantly.
[49:18.400 --> 49:19.400]  All right.
[49:19.400 --> 49:24.400]  So when does the, I want to search your pockets, Mike.
[49:25.400 --> 49:26.400]  I think you're the guy smoking weed over there.
[49:26.400 --> 49:27.400]  I don't consent to any searches, sir.
[49:27.400 --> 49:28.400]  You don't consent to any search.
[49:29.400 --> 49:30.400]  I feel like I need to search you, Mike.
[49:31.400 --> 49:32.400]  I don't consent to any searches, sir.
[49:33.400 --> 49:34.400]  Am I being detained?
[49:35.400 --> 49:37.400]  I don't have any grounds to detain you, so.
[49:38.400 --> 49:39.400]  Have a good evening, officer.
[49:39.400 --> 49:40.400]  Yeah.
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.400]  Can I run your name first?
[49:44.400 --> 49:45.400]  I'd like to run your name and then I'll let you go.
[49:46.400 --> 49:48.400]  You can go because you're an asshole and you know you're right.
[49:49.400 --> 49:51.400]  Just stay really calm.
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.400]  And like if you're screaming, am I being detained?
[49:55.400 --> 49:56.400]  The answer is going to be yes.
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.400]  Get on the ground.
[49:58.400 --> 50:00.400]  But if you just calmly, I'm sorry, sir.
[50:01.400 --> 50:02.400]  I have somewhere to be.
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.400]  Am I being detained?
[50:04.400 --> 50:05.400]  I'm not being detained, sir.
[50:05.400 --> 50:06.400]  I'd like to go.
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.400]  Am I free to go?
[50:07.400 --> 50:08.400]  Thank you, officer.
[50:08.400 --> 50:09.400]  Have a good night.
[50:09.400 --> 50:11.400]  You know, good luck investigating whatever it is you're doing.
[50:12.400 --> 50:13.400]  Wasn't me.
[50:13.400 --> 50:14.400]  Look.
[50:14.400 --> 50:15.400]  All right.
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.400]  So a couple of weeks ago, weekends ago, two or three weekends ago, by the time this podcast comes out, it'll be three weekends.
[50:20.400 --> 50:21.400]  There was an event called the Frost Bowl.
[50:21.400 --> 50:28.400]  The Frost Bowl was a local cannabis competition where people grew cannabis and entered their cannabis and people were judging it.
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.400]  And there was a party where people were consuming cannabis.
[50:32.400 --> 50:34.400]  And the police came and they raided that motherfucker.
[50:35.400 --> 50:36.400]  They didn't raid it.
[50:36.400 --> 50:38.400]  The word they used was raided, but they came and shut it down.
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.400]  But there were like 35 cops that surrounded the place and all stormed in all at once and shut the place down.
[50:43.400 --> 50:44.400]  Let's say we're in an event.
[50:46.400 --> 50:52.400]  I have to change my event now because I was going to say the Cannabis Cup, but as of the past couple of days, it doesn't look like the Denver Cannabis Cup is going to happen.
[50:53.400 --> 50:54.400]  Yes.
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.400]  They're currently looking for a new venue.
[50:55.400 --> 50:56.400]  Yeah, new venue.
[50:56.400 --> 50:57.400]  Yeah.
[50:57.400 --> 51:00.400]  And it sounds like a lot of places are not going to be able to give that permit that they want.
[51:00.400 --> 51:01.400]  They're still in Pueblo.
[51:01.400 --> 51:02.400]  State Fair.
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.400]  State Fair has already said they don't want anything to do with any cannabis stuff.
[51:05.400 --> 51:07.400]  And nobody wants to come to Pueblo.
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.400]  But I mean, if you did a Cannabis Cup there, that's...
[51:11.400 --> 51:12.400]  If you build it, they will come.
[51:12.400 --> 51:13.400]  You're the man.
[51:13.400 --> 51:14.400]  So let's say you're walking.
[51:15.400 --> 51:18.400]  Cannabis Cup happens at the State Fairgrounds in Pueblo, Colorado.
[51:18.400 --> 51:19.400]  I could fucking take an Uber over there.
[51:19.400 --> 51:20.400]  It costs me six bucks.
[51:20.400 --> 51:21.400]  An Uber over there.
[51:22.400 --> 51:23.400]  I'm dabbing the fuck out.
[51:23.400 --> 51:24.400]  I'm walking around.
[51:24.400 --> 51:28.400]  I've got, I don't know, four grams of shatter in my pocket and seven grams of good flour.
[51:29.400 --> 51:30.400]  Okay, let's be real.
[51:30.400 --> 51:33.400]  We've got an ounce of good flour and I got like 10 grams of shatter in my possession.
[51:33.400 --> 51:35.400]  I'm legal to carry that as an adult in Colorado.
[51:36.400 --> 51:37.400]  Cop walks up to me and wants to give me shit.
[51:38.400 --> 51:40.400]  How do I handle myself with this cop in public?
[51:41.400 --> 51:43.400]  At an event, at a cannabis event where I'm going to be fucked with.
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.400]  Sorry, I said straight in public, but it's at an event where we're all consuming.
[51:47.400 --> 51:48.400]  He's like, come here.
[51:48.400 --> 51:49.400]  I want to talk to you.
[51:50.400 --> 51:51.400]  Inside the event?
[51:52.400 --> 51:59.400]  I'd immediately like stop moving my feet and make sure my hands were in plain sight and just be like, what can I do for you, officer?
[51:59.400 --> 52:00.400]  I'd offer to smoke with him.
[52:01.400 --> 52:04.400]  Yeah, and just kind of resist their questions.
[52:04.400 --> 52:06.400]  Just the, am I being detained in my free to go circle?
[52:08.400 --> 52:12.400]  Um, in an event like that, especially like I'm not there to get messed with.
[52:12.400 --> 52:13.400]  I'm not doing anything.
[52:13.400 --> 52:14.400]  I haven't heard anyone.
[52:14.400 --> 52:15.400]  I'm not carrying a weapon.
[52:16.400 --> 52:17.400]  I didn't steal anything.
[52:18.400 --> 52:20.400]  Like I'm just not in the mood to be harassed.
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.400]  That's how I'd play it.
[52:22.400 --> 52:24.400]  Not in the mood to be harassed.
[52:24.400 --> 52:25.400]  Yep.
[52:25.400 --> 52:26.400]  All right.
[52:26.400 --> 52:27.400]  Do you say that to the cop?
[52:27.400 --> 52:28.400]  Occasionally.
[52:28.400 --> 52:29.400]  Occasionally.
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.400]  Like it hasn't really come up that I've had to run it like that since I was a teenager.
[52:32.400 --> 52:34.400]  Like the good evening officer.
[52:34.400 --> 52:35.400]  How are you?
[52:35.400 --> 52:36.400]  What can I do for you?
[52:36.400 --> 52:42.400]  Like, it doesn't matter if it's, oh, I was speeding or, oh, we got a noise complaint or, oh, it smells like weed out front.
[52:42.400 --> 52:50.400]  Like if you started off that way, nine times out of 10, just being polite and going like, no, I don't consent to any searches.
[52:50.400 --> 52:51.400]  No, I've got stuff to do later.
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.400]  Like, sorry guys.
[52:54.400 --> 52:55.400]  What can I do to help?
[52:55.400 --> 52:56.400]  Like, sorry guys.
[52:56.400 --> 52:57.400]  Sorry guys.
[52:57.400 --> 52:58.400]  Have a good night.
[52:58.400 --> 53:00.400]  Usually that gets you through it in five or ten minutes.
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.400]  Worst case scenario, they go get out of the car, they search your car, they find the weed, they write you a ticket for the weed, you go home.
[53:08.400 --> 53:09.400]  All right.
[53:09.400 --> 53:10.400]  That sounds reasonable.
[53:10.400 --> 53:11.400]  Sloppy standing up taking a dab.
[53:11.400 --> 53:12.400]  Sorry.
[53:12.400 --> 53:13.400]  No, I like it.
[53:13.400 --> 53:18.400]  So you don't bump the rig on the mic, so you don't dab the microphone like you did last time you were here.
[53:18.400 --> 53:30.400]  Like, even if you're about to get in a bunch of trouble, playing it cool with the original interaction with the officer assures you don't get really injured during that interaction.
[53:30.400 --> 53:31.400]  Don't get injured.
[53:31.400 --> 53:34.400]  Something I didn't mention earlier that I should have totally mentioned.
[53:34.400 --> 53:40.400]  The cop that pulled my friend over and gave him a DUI asked him how long it had been since he smoked last.
[53:40.400 --> 53:44.400]  My friend tried to play Mr. Honesty and told him a little too early, I think.
[53:44.400 --> 53:46.400]  I think that played a part of the arrest.
[53:47.400 --> 53:48.400]  Say yesterday.
[53:49.400 --> 53:55.400]  Like, if that cop's like, how long ago you're driving to get pulled over, a cop's like, when is the last time you smoked cannabis?
[53:55.400 --> 53:56.400]  Yesterday.
[53:56.400 --> 53:57.400]  Yeah.
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.400]  Yeah, not today.
[53:58.400 --> 53:59.400]  Before I went to bed.
[53:59.400 --> 54:01.400]  I only smoked cannabis to go to sleep.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.400]  You're not obligated to answer any of those questions.
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.400]  For sure.
[54:03.400 --> 54:06.400]  So when the cop goes, how long has it been since you've consumed marijuana?
[54:06.400 --> 54:10.400]  You can say, I don't, or I'm not legally obligated to answer that question.
[54:11.400 --> 54:12.400]  Plead the fifth.
[54:12.400 --> 54:18.400]  Like, if you're driving, you're required to hand over, like, license, registration, proof of insurance.
[54:18.400 --> 54:21.400]  But you're not legally required to self-incriminate.
[54:21.400 --> 54:24.400]  You're not legally required to answer any other questions.
[54:24.400 --> 54:25.400]  Dry snitching.
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.400]  Give him the minimum amount of information that you need to give him.
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.400]  Don't go on with snitching.
[54:31.400 --> 54:34.400]  You're legally obligated to comply.
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.400]  You can get arrested for just resisting.
[54:37.400 --> 54:41.400]  Like, if the cop walks up and you run away, like, the cop didn't even say anything.
[54:41.400 --> 54:46.400]  He just saw him walk onto your block or whatever and immediately turned and ran, and he chose to chase you and arrest you.
[54:46.400 --> 54:49.400]  You can get arrested for just resisting arrest.
[54:49.400 --> 54:50.400]  I got arrested for that.
[54:50.400 --> 54:53.400]  All charges got dropped immediately, but...
[54:54.400 --> 54:57.400]  A relation of mine got arrested just for that.
[55:00.400 --> 55:03.400]  They were climbing through the window of a party while he was in high school.
[55:04.400 --> 55:08.400]  And he put his arms out just to the sides and went, get out of my house, piggy.
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.400]  And he got tackled and handcuffed.
[55:10.400 --> 55:22.400]  And he thought it was hilarious, but he knew he'd survive it because after he was tackled and handcuffed, like, he could do and say what he wanted, and he was going to get bailed out in less than 24 hours anyway.
[55:23.400 --> 55:24.400]  Like...
[55:24.400 --> 55:25.400]  Yeah.
[55:25.400 --> 55:34.400]  I was young on probation, walking with another friend that was on probation, and we had heard that if you're on probation, you're not supposed to be with other people on probation.
[55:34.400 --> 55:40.400]  So these cops came up on us and I darted, and then I had a little dub stack on me, but I threw it.
[55:41.400 --> 55:49.400]  And then I got arrested, and as soon as I, like, I went to jail, got bailed out, and then as soon as I went to court, he was like, where are the other charges?
[55:49.400 --> 55:50.400]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.400]  He was like, well, what else did you get charged from?
[55:52.400 --> 55:55.400]  I said, oh, I just ran because I thought I wasn't supposed to be hanging out with this person.
[55:55.400 --> 55:58.400]  Automatically dropped, let it go, not on my record.
[55:58.400 --> 55:59.400]  Nice.
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.400]  So, I mean, that's a, that's an easy choice to get out of if you're just completely, you know, just...
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.400]  Even if you're about to get in trouble, it's so much easier to deal with in court without the, why did you run away?
[56:09.400 --> 56:12.400]  Like, why did you leave him on a car chase?
[56:12.400 --> 56:13.400]  Yeah.
[56:13.400 --> 56:16.400]  Like, why did you injure Detective So-and-so with your door?
[56:16.400 --> 56:17.400]  Don't do that type of shit.
[56:17.400 --> 56:18.400]  Like...
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.400]  Just don't do that.
[56:19.400 --> 56:21.400]  You just play it cool, and you're like...
[56:21.400 --> 56:22.400]  Slop turned his head, like...
[56:22.400 --> 56:23.400]  ...get out of it in court.
[56:23.400 --> 56:24.400]  No, I burped.
[56:24.400 --> 56:25.400]  I didn't, I wanted to be polite.
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.400]  You don't want to just let it go into the mic?
[56:27.400 --> 56:29.400]  Nah, it was directed towards you.
[56:29.400 --> 56:30.400]  I don't know.
[56:30.400 --> 56:31.400]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[56:31.400 --> 56:32.400]  I can give you that Dr. Pepper stank.
[56:32.400 --> 56:35.400]  Shout-outs to the Dr. Pepper, those 23 Terps.
[56:35.400 --> 56:36.400]  Right? Oh my god.
[56:36.400 --> 56:37.400]  Flavor's a date.
[56:37.400 --> 56:38.400]  Terp-alicious.
[56:38.400 --> 56:39.400]  Flavor's a date.
[56:39.400 --> 56:41.400]  Sometimes I pour other drinks in there, 25...
[56:41.400 --> 56:46.400]  Oh, uh, interesting thing about the police.
[56:46.400 --> 56:54.400]  Alright, so, if you're getting pulled over by an unmarked vehicle, would you pull over, or would you call it in?
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.400]  Uh, I'm a, I'm a dude.
[56:59.400 --> 57:00.400]  I can handle myself.
[57:00.400 --> 57:04.400]  I feel like, for the most part, I got pretty good judgment of what a cop looks like and whatnot.
[57:04.400 --> 57:11.400]  But if I, I'm not trying to be sexist here, if I were a small woman who wasn't as, fucking wasn't 6'5 and 200 pounds, you know what I mean?
[57:11.400 --> 57:15.400]  There are some girls, and I'm not even trying to, you could pick some girls up and just fucking carry them off.
[57:15.400 --> 57:18.400]  If I was that size of a girl, I would, I don't know, I'd reconsider my options.
[57:18.400 --> 57:20.400]  Slow down and call, call them in.
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.400]  Yeah, yeah, if you just call 911 and be like, hey, is this cop that's pulling me over for real?
[57:24.400 --> 57:25.400]  They'll tell you if it is or not.
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.400]  If you hit your hazard lights low way down, get over all the way to the right, and then just do like four miles an hour,
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.400]  or you call 911 and I'm, am I really being pulled over?
[57:35.400 --> 57:44.400]  Like, I'm a tiny woman, or I'm in a sketchy part of town, or da-da-da-da, it doesn't look like a cop car except for the flashing lights and the windshield.
[57:44.400 --> 57:47.400]  911 will know if you're being pulled over.
[57:47.400 --> 57:48.400]  For sure, yeah.
[57:48.400 --> 57:52.400]  And if it's not, they'll send people to pull over, whoever's trying to pull you over.
[57:52.400 --> 57:54.400]  And then just sit there with your windows up and wait.
[57:54.400 --> 57:56.400]  And that way they can get the person that's trying to fuck with you.
[57:56.400 --> 57:58.400]  Do you all remember when that was an issue?
[57:58.400 --> 58:00.400]  It still is from time to time.
[58:00.400 --> 58:06.400]  Every now and then you'll see in the police blotter was someone was arrested for pretending to be a cop.
[58:06.400 --> 58:07.400]  Impersonating, yeah.
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.400]  Like a year ago it happened here, but they pulled over a cop.
[58:11.400 --> 58:12.400]  Oh, wow.
[58:12.400 --> 58:17.400]  And immediately he was like, you ain't a cop, and like got out with his gun and was like, somebody go to jail.
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.400]  In North Carolina somebody was impersonating an officer and robbing people.
[58:22.400 --> 58:24.400]  Bless you, Joe.
[58:24.400 --> 58:26.400]  That's another thing.
[58:26.400 --> 58:33.400]  Do you think that you have to roll your window down all the way, or can you just do it the necessary amount to talk in exchange?
[58:33.400 --> 58:34.400]  Is that being a douche?
[58:34.400 --> 58:37.400]  Are you pushing the limit by not giving them the full window?
[58:37.400 --> 58:39.400]  What are you trying to prove?
[58:39.400 --> 58:41.400]  Yeah, just roll it down and talk to them.
[58:41.400 --> 58:44.400]  I mean, yeah, because if somebody's going to assault you, they're doing it through the glass anyway.
[58:44.400 --> 58:46.400]  That glass ain't stopping no like nothing.
[58:46.400 --> 58:49.400]  Impersonating an officer, how can I lick your ball sack today?
[58:49.400 --> 58:58.400]  Right, like that's why you play it cool from the get-go so that the cop doesn't decide to play it the hardest way possible.
[58:58.400 --> 59:02.400]  Because they could just decide to arrest you and come through that window no problem.
[59:02.400 --> 59:04.400]  Like just roll that fucker down.
[59:04.400 --> 59:07.400]  That's why you put the weed in the backseat or in the trunk.
[59:07.400 --> 59:11.400]  Throw it in an extra bag or a backpack so that your car doesn't stink while you're on the road.
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.400]  Don't have a roach burning in the ashtray when you get pulled over.
[59:15.400 --> 59:17.400]  Yeah, don't smoke and drive.
[59:17.400 --> 59:19.400]  Shout out to Oseum.
[59:19.400 --> 59:26.400]  I, man, I have to get on that don't smoke and drive shit for sure.
[59:26.400 --> 59:29.400]  Yeah, you got to be careful with that, bro. DUIs are no fun.
[59:29.400 --> 59:32.400]  If you do get fucking pulled over, if you get fucked, get yourself a good lawyer.
[59:32.400 --> 59:33.400]  Get a lawyer.
[59:33.400 --> 59:39.400]  If you can't afford a lawyer, get the free public defender one or go to a law school in your area.
[59:39.400 --> 59:45.400]  Nine times out of ten, they've got a third year law student who would fucking love to defend the living shit out of you for free.
[59:45.400 --> 59:49.400]  Don't believe what all your pothead friends are going to tell you and shit.
[59:49.400 --> 59:52.400]  Like, they'll hype you up, they'll get you scared, they'll make you feel relaxed.
[59:52.400 --> 59:55.400]  But they're just, they are not a lawyer.
[59:55.400 --> 59:58.400]  They're not a judge, they don't know the law, they don't know what's going to happen to you.
[59:58.400 --> 59:59.400]  Go get a lawyer.
[59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]  Take their advice.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.400]  Don't take your crazy Uncle Larry's advice.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.400]  Just go down there and tell them that you were this.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.400]  Just carry a fake ID and get arrested as somebody else.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.400]  Don't do that.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.400]  Terrible idea.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.400]  Please don't do that.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.400]  Sloppy, bad, bad sloppy.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400]  No doubt for you.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400]  All jokes.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]  Bad sloppy.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]  All jokes.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  Don't do that shit.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.400]  That's like, yeah, I'd rather get caught in a little weed than with a fake ID.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  Fuck.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]  All right.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.400]  So we've been going for a long time, you guys.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400]  Thanks for listening.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.400]  If you've made it an hour with us, that's a journey.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]  Really?
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  Time flies when there's a bunch of people at the table.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]  Yes, it sure does.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.400]  So does anybody have, would you like to shout out any social media or anything?
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.400]  Anything that you want to say since you got a microphone in your face and some people is listening.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.400]  I'll start going.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400]  We'll just go to the left here.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400]  You got anything you'd like to say over there, my friend?
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400]  Not really.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  All right.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400]  Just hanging out.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  Just hanging out.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  Kind of quiet this episode, but it's all good.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.400]  Mike had a lot to say.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.400]  It's cool.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400]  I wasn't trying.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.400]  I was just hanging.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.400]  So good.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]  Thanks for being here, brother.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  Yep.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  All right.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]  White Mike.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400]  Just be safe.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.400]  People don't get, don't get fucked by being nervous.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  How do our friends follow you on social media?
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.400]  You can find me at at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter or Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]  Make sure you support that.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]  Click it, give it a like, follow it.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.400]  Check out what Mike posts, share it, observe it.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  It's good shit.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.400]  People should start paying attention to politics.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400]  You get registered to vote.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.400]  This next year is going to be interesting in most states.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.400]  I wonder if Randy ever listens to the podcast.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  No poor Randy and his little square dome.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.400]  No, he, he doesn't read anything that he does.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400]  He suspects might not be pre-approved.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.400]  That's a really interesting way of educating oneself.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  Somebody, somebody share this podcast with Randy.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]  Let him learn the truth.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]  All right, sloppy.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  We're going to move over to you, Mike.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400]  Thanks for coming again, bro.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  I know you got to take time away from your youngster to come hang out with us.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400]  High five your boy for me.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400]  Will do.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  Nice sloppy sloppy.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.400]  How can all the people listening, how can they find you on social media,
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, however you want to do it.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.400]  I am sloppy 9 1 9 on everything except for Tumblr.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.400]  I think it's sloppy brains.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  Sloppy brains.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.400]  I didn't make that, but somebody made it for me.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.400]  And then yeah, dead God 9 1 9 as well as our music.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400]  So you're trying to check that out.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]  I think I follow that.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]  Didn't know that was you.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.400]  Yep.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.400]  Boy, nice.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400]  All right.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  Stay out the left lane people.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]  Oh dude.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400]  Are you fucking serious?
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  Did you just say that?
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  I, I, I, Oh my God.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.400]  I'm turning beat right over here.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400]  Try not to smack the table.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.400]  I drive 50 miles to and from work every day.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400]  It's 50 miles each way.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  A hundred miles on the road.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.400]  Uh, there's one exit where I go.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.400]  It probably takes me 10 minutes just to get on the damn on ramp because the
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400]  construction in Colorado Springs right now.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.400]  Uh, if you're in the left lane, you should be passing somebody.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.400]  If I am behind you in the left lane and you think I'm writing your ass,
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  I am not an asshole.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  See the left lane is for passing.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.400]  That lane over there to the right is for the slower moving traffic.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  There are big signs on the interstate.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.400]  It's a slower traffic.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.400]  Keep right.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  That means fucking you.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.400]  If, if I'm writing your, if I'm writing your ass in the left lane,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.400]  all it means is you're a conceited fuck.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400]  That's what it's like.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  Don't flick your cigarette at me.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.400]  Don't give me the finger, put on your damn blinker and move over and let me
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.400]  zip past you and then get back to the thing is too.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.400]  I don't even care if you're going 10 miles over and I'm trying to go 20.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400]  Honestly, not to sound like, like a, like fuck it,
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.400]  but the left lane is the go as fast as you please and risk getting a ticket
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  lane straight up.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400]  It's another passing people and then get back in the right lane.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400]  As soon as you pass somebody, get in the right lane, keep doing it.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400]  People be like, Oh, you're weaving a lot.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]  I'm like, no, I'm driving correctly.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400]  You fucking idiot.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.400]  Like, I'm not driving.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.400]  Get out the left lane.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400]  Oh, I didn't know.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  There's a sign every five miles that says keep right in less passing.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.400]  Truth.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]  All right.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400]  And don't be that,
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400]  that social justice warrior that tries to slow me down.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400]  He's going too fast.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400]  I'm going to pull it front of him.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]  It's not your road.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  No, it is our road.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.400]  If I want to get a ticket, I'll take it.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.400]  I throw water bottles at people.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  Straight up.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  I'm vomiting.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]  I'm not going to get a ticket.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400]  I throw water bottles at people.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.400]  Straight up.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.400]  I've vomited a couple of people with water bottles.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400]  This is how the breeze.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]  Not to do things now that you've grown up.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400]  You don't do that anymore.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]  Right, Soppy?
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400]  What?
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400]  I did that two weeks ago.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400]  Come on, Soppy.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400]  Soppy, help us out here.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400]  No, I'm just playing.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400]  I did.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.400]  But yeah, no, for real.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.400]  Yo, driving is, driving is not a game.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400]  You're playing with people's lives.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400]  Pay attention.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.400]  I get enraged sometimes when people do stupid shit on the road.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.400]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400]  And, and I drive a Prius.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400]  Nobody wants to get beat up by the guy that was driving the Prius.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.400]  Because then you got to go home and lie.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.400]  You have to be like, it was six guys in a Jeep.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  And then, no, it was one dude with a fucking Bob Ross Afro hopping out here and whooping your ass out the Prius.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]  And then getting back in there.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400]  Tattooed Bob Ross in a Prius.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400]  Beat my ass.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]  And then driving away in all ears.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.400]  Hello from the other side.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400]  Adele.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.400]  It's hard to be tough when you pull up and your car goes wing, wing.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]  No, you don't.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400]  No, that's where you're wrong.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400]  You don't hear the Prius pull up at all.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.400]  I have literally had people in the car and then drove off and they were like, you started this?
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400]  Like.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]  All right.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]  So, we've got a long time.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.400]  If you guys have been listening for this long, I love all of you.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400]  We're going to wrap up this part of the show.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400]  We're going to take some dabs.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.400]  And I will be back to put a tail on this episode.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]  All right, guys.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400]  I want to send another huge thank you to our guests.

[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.400]  We're going to talk about selecting a male plant for breeding.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  It should be a great educational episode.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400]  I need to give another shout out to our sponsor.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.400]  Big shout out to Hitman Glass.

[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.400]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:09:33.020]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.020]  It's time for episode number 121 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.020]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.020]  That's right.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:46.020]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:50.020]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.020]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.

[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.020]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:03.020]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my show.

[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020]  Hitman Glass.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:15.020]  When I buy a new rig, I like to buy something made in America by an American.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.020]  And that's why I support Hitman Glass.

[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.020]  The Chalice Festival.

[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.020]  I hope everybody's having a great week.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.020]  You guys, this is a great episode in my opinion.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:43.020]  My good buddy Rob from Sour Seeds dropped by, and we talk about selecting a male plant for breeding.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.020]  So I'm going to let the music play for a couple of seconds.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.020]  And when we come back, our good buddy Rob and I will be sitting at the table.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.020]  Stay tuned.
[01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:06.110]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:08.110]  I am back with our good friend Rob from Sour Seeds.
[01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:09.110]  How you doing tonight, bro?
[01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:10.110]  How you doing, man? Thanks for having me.
[01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:12.110]  Oh, dude, thanks for coming, taking some time out of your day.
[01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.110]  Always.
[01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.110]  We've been talking. We're both busy cats, dude.
[01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:16.110]  You got a lot of things on your head. I'm impressed.
[01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.110]  Too much.
[01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:18.110]  You looking forward to the Cannabis Cup?
[01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:19.110]  Absolutely.
[01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:23.110]  So this will be the first time we've spoke about this on the podcast.
[01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:28.110]  The Cannabis Cup that was planned for Denver over the 420 weekend, Denver said no.
[01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:30.110]  They did not issue the permits that were needed.
[01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:36.110]  High Times response was to move the Cannabis Cup to Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:37.110]  Woo-hoo!
[01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.110]  Yeah, that's where we are.
[01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:39.110]  That is our location.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.110]  That is my town.
[01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.110]  That's where this podcast is recorded.
[01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:48.110]  So the podcast, no matter where the podcast lands in Pueblo, it will be 20 minutes from my house at maximum.
[01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:49.110]  That's it.
[01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:50.110]  I'm pretty stoked on that.
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.110]  We're going to have a whole bunch of cool people around here.
[01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:54.110]  We're going to have a whole bunch of cool shit to do.
[01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:58.110]  I'm hoping to get a whole bunch of cool people on the podcast since it's nearby.
[01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:05.110]  They can either come here and record in the kitchen slash studio podcast setup, or I've got a portable unit we'll take.
[01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:07.110]  Hopefully, we'll get a whole bunch of cool folks.
[01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:08.110]  Don't be afraid to come, you guys.
[01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:12.110]  A lot of people seem to be talking shit on Facebook about Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.110]  Boo!
[01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:17.110]  All the people that are talking shit have never been here.
[01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:18.110]  Well, that's it.
[01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:20.110]  And I'm from Florida, and I love it here, so that tells you something right there.
[01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:21.110]  Yeah.
[01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:23.110]  I landed here because of research.
[01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:24.110]  There you go.
[01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:25.110]  That's even worse.
[01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:26.110]  I landed here because of research.
[01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:28.110]  Then when I got here, I visited Denver.
[01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.110]  I visited Springs.
[01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:32.110]  I went in South, Walsenburg.
[01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:36.110]  I've been all over for being here a short amount of time in three years, and I really love Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:37.110]  It's a nice, humble town.
[01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.110]  You get to know the people here.
[01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:39.110]  They'll take care of you.
[01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:40.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:41.110]  Denver's too expensive.
[01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:44.110]  Springs is kind of a military vibe.
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.110]  I think it's a high crime, too.
[01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.110]  Okay.
[01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:50.110]  Yeah, I've been—I work in Springs now, and I see a lot of wonky shit on my brakes.
[01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:53.110]  Honestly, I see some strange shit happening.
[01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:56.110]  I just watch the crazy-ass local news, man, and it's always going down in Springs.
[01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:57.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:57.110 --> 01:13:03.110]  Well, there are a couple of parts of Pueblo that I would not go to, but for the most part, this place is not that bad, you guys.
[01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:04.110]  So come hang out at the Cannabis Cup.
[01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.110]  Have a good time.
[01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:07.110]  Sour Seeds should have a booth out there.
[01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:08.110]  You know I'll be running around.
[01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.110]  I don't have a booth.
[01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:11.110]  I will not do a booth this year.
[01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:13.110]  I'll have an IREAD Genetics t-shirt on.
[01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.110]  I'll be running around, having a good time.
[01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:16.110]  That's a long ways away, but we're stoked about it.
[01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:18.110]  The Cannabis Cup is coming to Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.110]  Don't be afraid.
[01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:21.110]  Come see us.
[01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.110]  Absolutely.
[01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.110]  It's going to be a lot of fun, guys.
[01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.110]  All right, guys, so we're going to do a little show about breeding cannabis.
[01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.110]  We want to do a show about selecting a male plant.
[01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.110]  Sorry, we're both coughing over here.
[01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:30.110]  I'm taking some dabs.
[01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:31.110]  Rob's smoking a joint.
[01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:32.110]  What strain are you smoking on, bro?
[01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:34.110]  Probably some of that Tut and Common.
[01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.110]  The King Tut?
[01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.110]  It tastes good.
[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:40.110]  It smells kind of—it's got a unique smell, a very unique smell.
[01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.110]  I don't even know how to describe that.
[01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:45.110]  It almost reminded me of a specific terpenoid.
[01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.110]  I can't remember which one we decided it smelled like anymore.
[01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:49.110]  It started with an L.
[01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:50.110]  Linolool.
[01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:51.110]  Linolool.
[01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.110]  Linolool.
[01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.110]  Thank you for the heads up there.
[01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.110]  I can never remember the name of Linolool.
[01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.110]  It's always the one that I forget.
[01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:59.110]  That herb smells like it's got a lot of Linolool in it.
[01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:01.110]  Anyway, we're choking over here because we're getting high.
[01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:04.110]  I'm smoking some Terpex Sour Death Star Wax.
[01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.110]  Shout out to the Terpex crew.
[01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:10.110]  All right, we're going to do a podcast about selecting a male plant for breeding.
[01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:15.110]  If you're trying to breed some seeds, there are a few things to look for in a male plant.
[01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:18.110]  Let's say you buy yourself a 10-pack.
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:23.110]  I would do it two 10-packs if you're trying to do a pheno hunt to find a male, but not everybody's got the room.
[01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.110]  Try to do at least two 10-packs.
[01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:25.110]  There's power in numbers.
[01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.110]  When you're pheno hunting, the more plants, the better.
[01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:28.110]  I agree.
[01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:29.110]  20 to 50 is a good number.
[01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.110]  Right.
[01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.110]  You can usually find super plants in 20 to 50.
[01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:35.110]  Just astounding keepers that stand out.
[01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:38.110]  Yeah, and if you can't do that many at a time, just do them in phases.
[01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:39.110]  Do 10.
[01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.110]  Find a keeper out of that 10.
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:41.110]  Do 10 more.
[01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.110]  Find the best out of those two.
[01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.110]  Yeah, out of those 10.
[01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.110]  Then you got two to stack up against each other.
[01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:49.110]  Keep doing it until your room is full, then start eliminating shit.
[01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.110]  That's right.
[01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.110]  I even sometimes I do it from seeds right out of the gate.
[01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.110]  You can kind of tell.
[01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.110]  You have those seeds that just look like they're going to have a hard time.
[01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:57.110]  They're going to struggle.
[01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:59.110]  You can tell whenever they open the shell.
[01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:04.110]  They have the little tiny leaves or sometimes are mutated or doesn't look as strong or vibrant as the others.
[01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:06.110]  I just go ahead and chuck them right out of the gate.
[01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:09.110]  As a breeder, as somebody who is ... I've bred a lot of plants.
[01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:15.110]  If you were looking for a male plant, you're going to have to learn to get rid of some plants and not be too attached to your babies.
[01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.110]  Be ruthless.
[01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:17.110]  Yes, be ruthless.
[01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:18.110]  These are not humans.
[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:20.110]  These are little baby plants, and you are creating the future of cannabis.
[01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.110]  That's right.
[01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:28.110]  If you do not pull those ugly little fuckers, you are going to ruin and fuck up, and you're going to retard the progression of cannabis.
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:29.110]  That's exactly it.
[01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.110]  You're going to water the genetics down.
[01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.110]  Yes, you are, and we don't want to do that.
[01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.110]  We're breeding to improve the genetics.
[01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:36.110]  If you have a plant, you start a bunch of seeds.
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:38.110]  You got a couple that are kind of wonky looking.
[01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:39.110]  You got one with a fucked up leaf.
[01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.110]  Don't be afraid to get rid of it.
[01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:42.110]  That's right.
[01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:45.110]  As they grow, keep a good eye on them.
[01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:50.110]  Before we get to that part, let's talk about what the male plant is going to bring to our breeding project.
[01:15:50.110 --> 01:16:01.110]  When we hit a male plant with pollen to a female plant that accepts pollen that has pistils, it's going to create seeds that are going to have traits of both plants.
[01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:05.110]  What is the male mostly going to bring to the table here?
[01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:12.110]  I feel like it's going to bring a lot of the pest resistance and a lot of the vigor and a lot of the shape.
[01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:13.110]  That's it.
[01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:16.110]  That's really a lot of what it is, the hybrid vigor.
[01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:21.110]  Without that male side of the family, you really can't catch that true hard vigor like that.
[01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:27.110]  I always tell people all the time, you can't create Halle Berries by eliminating half the gene pool.
[01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:31.110]  I like the way you put that.
[01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:33.110]  People will catch on there.
[01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:37.110]  Yeah, we need the male to bring that good structure and the resistance.
[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:40.110]  I think a lot of the flavor comes from mama, it comes from the girl.
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:44.110]  When you're looking for structure and shape, a lot of it is going to come from the boy.
[01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:49.110]  Now we can talk a little bit about what to look for in a male plant.
[01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.110]  I keep saying the structure.
[01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:53.110]  I like a male plant.
[01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:56.110]  If you're breeding a sativa, you're going to want one that gets a little bit taller.
[01:16:56.110 --> 01:17:02.110]  When you're in veg, the males are always going to start taking off a little taller.
[01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:07.110]  Their goal is to get above the females so that when they pollinate, their pollen falls down onto the girls.
[01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:08.110]  That's a good hint.
[01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:11.110]  When they're growing in veg, look for that one that's taken off.
[01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:12.110]  That might be a boy for you.
[01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:13.110]  Absolutely.
[01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:19.110]  You're looking for, if you've got a sativa, you want the one that keeps not too tall and doesn't take off too much
[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:23.110]  because you don't want to make your progeny skyrocket immediately.
[01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:25.110]  You want to find the one that's the right shape.
[01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:28.110]  You almost want to find what you want your girls to look like.
[01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:33.110]  You want the boy to look the shape to be what you want your females to look like is what I think I'm trying to say.
[01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.110]  Look for that.
[01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:37.110]  You want tight, close node spacing.
[01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.110]  You don't want a whole bunch of gaps between your branches.
[01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:44.110]  I don't like it when a plant spits out really long branches like Tahoe OG.
[01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:45.110]  I was going to say the OGs.
[01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:49.110]  That was about to come right out of my mouth, the OG family, the whole family over there on that side,
[01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:53.110]  even Grape Stomp or OG and some of the other ones that are hybrids, most of them take off because of the boys.
[01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:55.110]  Like you're saying, the structure, it comes from the males.
[01:17:55.110 --> 01:18:04.110]  The perfect example, Joseph, the Joseph male, the Gage uses everything they cross, that great male, by the way, but it comes out tall.
[01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:07.110]  A lot of the times you get mostly dominant phenotypes of stretchy plants because of that.
[01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:10.110]  Stretchy, stretchy with little popcorn balls coming off everywhere.
[01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:11.110]  That's it.
[01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:13.110]  It's a dominant OG male, and that's what's going on there.
[01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:18.110]  It's that structure taking over the dominance from that male plant, and it's the OG dominance.
[01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:24.110]  And the OGs always, the Cush's have always had that dominance, and it really is an Afghan heritage.
[01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.110]  It's just trace back.
[01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:35.110]  It's recessive Afghan genes that are really strong, and they're always going to come forward and breed true unless you find a dominant gene from a different side of the family that breeds just as hard, like something from Blue Dream, for example.
[01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:40.110]  Good example of a good breeding parent, or White Widow used to be a really good breeding parent.
[01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:43.110]  I've bred the White Widow with two other strains, and it does very well.
[01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:46.110]  That's it, exactly, and that's what you're doing at that time.
[01:18:46.110 --> 01:19:00.110]  You're taking a diversity of genotypes from different parts of the world, Brazil, South America, things like that, and then diversifying them against things like OG Cush's, which are originally derivative Afghan, places like that.
[01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:06.110]  They're mostly perched in the California, East Coast, places with coastlines, and then out.
[01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.110]  Out.
[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:13.110]  A lot of the stuff that started off in the Dutch genetics has those real thin leaves because it was all bred for indoor cultivation.
[01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:20.110]  A lot of Brazilian and Sativa genetics, and then Nepal and things like that, Nepalese genetics, Moroccan genetics.
[01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:23.110]  You see a lot of Spain, a lot of Spanish genetics.
[01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:27.110]  That's where you see an influx of that in the Netherlands.
[01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:31.110]  I want to give a shout out to Gage Green Genetics since we were talking about the Grape Stomper OG there.
[01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:34.110]  Those guys finally took home a Cannabis Cup for the Grape Stomper.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:35.110]  Good work, guys.
[01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:36.110]  Nothing but love and respect for you.
[01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:37.110]  Gage Green.
[01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:38.110]  Congrats.
[01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:41.110]  M4K, MK4, and Keep Play.
[01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.110]  The whole crew, they helped me get a little start in the cannabis industry.
[01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:45.110]  Much love, much respect.
[01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:46.110]  Shout out for that.
[01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.110]  Look for something that doesn't get too tall, too crazy.
[01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:55.110]  If you're looking for an indica, if you're trying to breed an indica male, find the shortest, stoutest, squattiest one you can find.
[01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:58.110]  Probably with those big, fattest leaves you can find.
[01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:01.110]  Those dinner plate leaves.
[01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:08.110]  If you can camp out under those leaves, if you can almost make a hammock under those leaves, that'd be a sweet male to breed with if you're looking for a nice indica plant.
[01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:13.110]  You want something with nice, tight, close node spacing.
[01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:16.110]  If you can find a male plant, you've got to flower them out.
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.110]  You've got to veg them out.
[01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:20.110]  Note their structure in veg.
[01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:21.110]  Watch what they do.
[01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:22.110]  You don't have to get them too tall.
[01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:24.110]  Take a clone off of them.
[01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.110]  Label the clone that matches.
[01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:29.110]  Clone A to Plant A. Clone B to Plant B.
[01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:31.110]  Flower your plants out.
[01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:32.110]  See what they do.
[01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:37.110]  If you've got females and you're looking for males, you can just go ahead and toss the females, or you can finish them out and have some buds.
[01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:40.110]  I will take my male plants and flower them all the way out to see what they do.
[01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:44.110]  All the way to seven, eight, maybe nine weeks into flower.
[01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:46.110]  I want to see if they're going to produce trichomes.
[01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:49.110]  I want to see if they're going to produce a whole bunch of pollen.
[01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:53.110]  I want to see if they're just barely ... Some plants will only produce a little bit of pollen.
[01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:57.110]  As a breeder, you can see which pollen will be ... There's grainy pollen.
[01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:59.110]  I don't feel like that pollen's worth a shit.
[01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:01.110]  It's the pre-pollen.
[01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:04.110]  It's the pollen before your plants actually start busting out.
[01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:06.110]  That real grainy, dusty shit, I don't think that is good.
[01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:09.110]  You want to let that ... If you're going to collect pollen, let that fall.
[01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:15.110]  Let that get away, and then collect that ... It's about 14 days into the pollination.
[01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:18.110]  That's about 10 to 14 days into when they bust open.
[01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:20.110]  That's when the really good pollen starts coming out.
[01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:23.110]  It's a little softer, a little smoother to the touch.
[01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:25.110]  Plants fully maturing into flower at that point.
[01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:27.110]  It's hormones are going in overdrive.
[01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:28.110]  He's doing it.
[01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:30.110]  He's spraying all over those plants.
[01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:31.110]  He's letting them go.
[01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:37.110]  If your plant is producing trichomes and a whole bunch of resin and has the perfect structure,
[01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.110]  you want to breed with that.
[01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:41.110]  I like to rub the stem and smell the stem of my plant.
[01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:43.110]  That's one of my favorite things.
[01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:45.110]  If it smells like puke, it's a good thing.
[01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:46.110]  It's a good thing.
[01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:51.110]  All those plants, when you ... For some reason, when it's got a hint of bar trash can and vomit,
[01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:53.110]  that's a good male to breed with.
[01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:54.110]  That's it.
[01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:55.110]  To me, that's it.
[01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.110]  A lot of that, when you smell that stem, and if it's a male, you can go across the board
[01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:02.110]  and say you have a bunch in a row from your pheno hunt that you're doing.
[01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:03.110]  Put them all next to each other.
[01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:05.110]  Sit down, smell each one of them side by side.
[01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:07.110]  Make sure you're cleaning your hands each time.
[01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:09.110]  Get a really good profile of what each one's doing.
[01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:12.110]  Usually, the one that stinks the worst is the best one to use.
[01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:17.110]  Typically, and then you narrow it down by smell, and then narrow it down by structure, site.
[01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:18.110]  Use all your senses.
[01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:19.110]  Don't eliminate anything.
[01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:23.110]  Feel free to take a leaf and snap one off and taste the stem a little bit.
[01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:25.110]  If it's sour and tart to you and stuff a lot of the time,
[01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:28.110]  and you're using hardly no nutrients at all, it's a good thing.
[01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.110]  It's telling you I got a lot of terpenes.
[01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.110]  I got a lot to add to the table.
[01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:35.110]  The male is definitely going to contribute to the flavor.
[01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:39.110]  I think the mama definitely overwhelms the flavor category,
[01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:43.110]  but the male is going to contribute to the amount of flavor.
[01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:45.110]  You don't want to just use any old male.
[01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.110]  You want to use the best one you can at any and all costs.
[01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:53.110]  That's just one of those things that we look for, I think.
[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:58.110]  If you best a 10-pack of seeds, you'll probably find maybe five males, hopefully.
[01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:00.110]  Five females, five males.
[01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.110]  You're going to toss two of those right away.
[01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.110]  One of them is going to be funky.
[01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:05.110]  One of them is going to be a runt, so those go away.
[01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.110]  Now, you got three.
[01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:10.110]  I think that I never use...
[01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:15.110]  No, I personally know that I never use that first plant to show me male flowers.
[01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:16.110]  I don't like to take that first one.
[01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:17.110]  He's too dominant.
[01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:20.110]  I feel like he's going to do too much to my breeding.
[01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:22.110]  All the plants are going to look like that one.
[01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:27.110]  If I've got three of them, I kind of would lean toward the third one to flower.
[01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:32.110]  If I had five males that worked well, probably that third or fourth one would be the one that I would use.
[01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:36.110]  I wouldn't go right for that first one that busted out because it's too obvious.
[01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:37.110]  Me, I always choose it.
[01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:42.110]  Honestly, when I'm doing my breeding, I always choose it based on what the mother is doing,
[01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:44.110]  what I'm trying to do.
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:48.110]  If I'm trying to, say, if I'm out crossing a blue dream or a sativa or something close to it
[01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:53.110]  that has a longer flowering time and I want to come in with an indica and actually shorten his flowering time,
[01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:59.110]  then that's when I would choose a male that's bust out first because I want to take that flowering time and cut it down.
[01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:01.110]  Really cut it down with that dominant male.
[01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:02.110]  There you go.
[01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.110]  That's perfect.
[01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:04.110]  Thank you.
[01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:08.110]  But if, say, you have a little indica dominant, but you want to make it a true hybrid
[01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:13.110]  and you want to make it go a little bit longer in the garden, say, more if it's a seven, eight week,
[01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:16.110]  and you want it to go more like eight, nine, maybe ten-ish or something like that,
[01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:19.110]  then that's another reason you'd go with a longer flowering male.
[01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:21.110]  Same instance, just vice versa.
[01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:24.110]  And don't be afraid to have plants that flower for a long time, you guys.
[01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:30.110]  I know nine, ten, and eleven weeks sounds like scary flowering times, but I've flowered plants for 14 and 15 weeks.
[01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:33.110]  What happens is amazing once they get that ripe and that far in.
[01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:39.110]  Sour diesel is a good example of that, going that long, ten, eleven weeks on it, but it's well worth it in the end.
[01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:42.110]  I mean, you're getting a connoisseur product that you can't gain anywhere else,
[01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:44.110]  and the test results will show you the rest.
[01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:47.110]  And the harvest waits come through. It makes it well worth it.
[01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:51.110]  I had an African land race that didn't have a name, and it grew colas.
[01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:54.110]  I cut it down in week 14, and the colas were bigger than my legs.
[01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:59.110]  I think this is the biggest complication with all growers, young to old, is patience.
[01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:02.110]  Yeah, I think it's the hardest thing we all have to overcome.
[01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.110]  Just in life.
[01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:04.110]  That's it.
[01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:05.110]  In general.
[01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:06.110]  That's it.
[01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:09.110]  All right, I got to take a drink. I'm about to choke, and then we're going to keep this moving.
[01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:16.430]  All right, I'll edit that part out.
[01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:19.430]  I was going to beatbox.
[01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:21.430]  Oh, man, you should have. That would have been fresh.
[01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:23.430]  I might not even edit it now since you're beatboxing.
[01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:25.430]  I might just leave that part right there.
[01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:27.430]  All right.
[01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:29.430]  What else do you want to add to that, bro?
[01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:31.430]  You got anything you want to add to talking about selecting a male?
[01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:36.430]  We pretty much covered it. I mean, use all your senses, you know, and breed for a purpose.
[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.430]  That's the biggest thing, breed for purpose.
[01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:40.430]  I can't stress that enough. Breed for purpose.
[01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:45.430]  All because if it's good, and you want to bang it together with something else that just looks good,
[01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:48.430]  don't do it just because to do it, or don't do it because you got a cool name lined up.
[01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:50.430]  Do it for purpose. Do it for purpose.
[01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:56.430]  We see too much of that in the industry every day that you got to, you know, create the strain, come up with the name, lastly.
[01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:59.430]  Yes, and if you do make something and it sucks.
[01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:02.430]  Okay, so let's say you make a strain.
[01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:06.430]  You take whatever, you've got this male, and then you've got this prized female.
[01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:08.430]  You throw pollen all over it. You let it go.
[01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:14.430]  So once you pollinate, it's going to take you, you know, about six more weeks until the seeds are ready.
[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.430]  Maybe six or eight more weeks before you can chop that plant down.
[01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:19.430]  I let the plants dry until they're crispy at that point.
[01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:23.430]  I just chop them down, let them get super crispy, and then I just rub them, and the seeds fall out.
[01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:24.430]  And then I go and collect all the seeds.
[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:27.430]  And then I blast the material into oil, honestly.
[01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:29.430]  But so then you got to grow those seeds yourself.
[01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.430]  I would recommend you grow a hundred of them.
[01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:35.430]  Just at least germinate a hundred of them right away and see what they do.
[01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:39.430]  Before you give any of them away to anybody, germinate a hundred of them.
[01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:42.430]  Veg out at least 50, and flower at least 25 of them.
[01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:44.430]  Dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:45.430]  See what they do.
[01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:48.430]  If it sucks, flush the seeds down the toilet.
[01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:50.430]  Get rid of them. Feed them to your birds.
[01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:51.430]  That's when stuff happens.
[01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:52.430]  We're all human.
[01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:55.430]  We all make mistakes, and you can only control what you're doing so much.
[01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:57.430]  It's not. It's nature.
[01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:58.430]  That's it. Nature.
[01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.430]  You can only control so much of what you're doing.
[01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:01.430]  The rest is left in our hands.
[01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:04.430]  Yeah, and sometimes things just don't want to breed together.
[01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:05.430]  I made a strain that totally sucked.
[01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:10.430]  It produced giant colas that tasted amazing, but it would not get you high at all.
[01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:13.430]  You could smoke the entire crop.
[01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:15.430]  No high at all.
[01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:18.430]  Yeah, I'm guilty of that.
[01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:21.430]  My main thing was breeding.
[01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:23.430]  We had one recently that came out.
[01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:25.430]  It was a Dante's Inferno.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:27.430]  It was a big hit for a lot of people because a lot of people,
[01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:30.430]  there are connoisseur smokers out there that like growing things like Grin Spoon
[01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:35.430]  and other strains out there that are just absolutely 100% top-grade
[01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.430]  connoisseur weed that yield like crap.
[01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:38.430]  Girl Scout cookies.
[01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:39.430]  Girl Scout cookies.
[01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:41.430]  It's not known for its yield.
[01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.430]  It's known for its power and its flavor.
[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:45.430]  That peppery, sweet funk taste.
[01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:48.430]  Well, that's it, and you're not growing that as a cash crop.
[01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.430]  A lot of the times you're growing that for personal,
[01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:54.430]  and if you are growing it for cash crop, you have a lot of room and a lot of lights.
[01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:57.430]  A bunch of Govita somewhere.
[01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:58.430]  That's it, dude.
[01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:00.430]  Warehouse style.
[01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:02.430]  What were we even talking about to get a standpoint?
[01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:03.430]  Males.
[01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:06.430]  But anyway, I did have something I wanted to add to the males.
[01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:07.430]  Terpenes.
[01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:09.430]  Breeding for terps.
[01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:11.430]  One of our perfect ones that's coming up now,
[01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:15.430]  it's going to be one of our big front runners, is the S1 version of our Blueberry Fuel.
[01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:18.430]  This cut has amazing terpenes.
[01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:20.430]  It's just off the hand.
[01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:21.430]  It's hard to explain.
[01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.430]  It's really, really hard to explain.
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.430]  It's got a little bit of everything in it,
[01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:28.430]  and the reason that is is because when you're choosing males and females
[01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:31.430]  and you're doing that breeding work, actually look at their terpene profile.
[01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:34.430]  If you don't know and you can get it tested, spend the $40, $50, $75,
[01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:36.430]  whatever it takes, get it tested.
[01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.430]  Then you have paperwork to back your stuff up.
[01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:40.430]  If you're in a legal state, you should be able to get your stuff tested.
[01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:41.430]  Absolutely.
[01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:44.430]  And the more widely it's becoming nowadays, you have literally half the country now.
[01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:46.430]  We're 50-50 and it's taken over,
[01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:49.430]  and you should be able to get it tested by someone, somehow, somewhere.
[01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:55.430]  Forums, use your connections, reach out, and then get it done.
[01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.430]  And it makes a big difference.
[01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.430]  I mean, you can find out a terpene profile
[01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:03.430]  and then try to match it up with something that absolutely would complement
[01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:07.430]  those terpenes but doesn't have them, like our blueberry fuel.
[01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:10.430]  You have Blue Dream, which is a good clone only, a good breeding parent.
[01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.430]  Breeds true, it breeds solid.
[01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.430]  It's known to breed stable.
[01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:15.430]  I bred a couple good strains with it.
[01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:19.430]  You can pop 100, 200 seeds and you might get one or two Hermes out of it
[01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:22.430]  just because it breeds that stable.
[01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:24.430]  And it usually takes the dominance of things,
[01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:28.430]  but when you breed it with something like OGs and diesels and things like that,
[01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:31.430]  you add a whole different terpene profile that really complements
[01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:35.430]  the blueberry muffin-y hues and the blend and the creaminess of the Blue Dream.
[01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:37.430]  It just stands out and it creates a whole other animal.
[01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:40.430]  And then you don't even – most people, when you smoke it with them first,
[01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:42.430]  tell them what it is lastly.
[01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:44.430]  They never even would have guessed it came from Blue Dream.
[01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:45.430]  That's the thing.
[01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:49.430]  They look at it, never would have thought, taste it, never would have thought,
[01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:50.430]  and it just peels them back.
[01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:52.430]  It's got diesels.
[01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.430]  It's got OG tones.
[01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:54.430]  It's got blueberry tones.
[01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:58.430]  It's got creamy tones in it, and it's just off the hook, man.
[01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:59.430]  That's all I can say.
[01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:00.430]  I think I've smoked some of that with you before.
[01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:03.430]  I think you brought that last time, and it was definitely a tasty strain
[01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.430]  if that was what you brought for me to smoke.
[01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:08.430]  I've noticed everything I breed to the Blue Dream,
[01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:12.430]  I've never used it as a male, obviously, because it's a clone only and it's a girl.
[01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:16.430]  But everything I've bred to it, it has made huge colas, everything you put to it.
[01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:17.430]  That's it.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:18.430]  That's it too.
[01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:22.430]  That's why we did the OG cross on it typically was to actually gain a little bit of extra yield.
[01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:23.430]  Want it?
[01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:25.430]  Yeah, because OGs are lanky and stuff.
[01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:28.430]  I was trying to put more – I bred Grateful Dog to the Blue Dream,
[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:33.430]  and I call it the Blue Healer, and my point was to put more vigor to the Grateful Dog,
[01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:35.430]  just make it a little bit bigger, a little chunkier.
[01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:38.430]  But I'm not a fan of the flavor of Blue Dream.
[01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:40.430]  It's girl weed.
[01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:41.430]  It tastes like stripper weed.
[01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:42.430]  It is.
[01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:44.430]  It's kind of like a bland blueberry.
[01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:46.430]  It's real muffiny and real creamy.
[01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:49.430]  It tastes like Jiffy Muffin smell.
[01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:50.430]  Okay.
[01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.430]  Like in the oven when you get the Jiffy Muffins, you put the blueberry muffins in,
[01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:55.430]  and it kind of has that aroma of blueberry.
[01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:57.430]  That fairy muffiny blueberry air freshener instead of blueberry candies.
[01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:58.430]  That's it.
[01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:00.430]  Or like that blueberry marker.
[01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:01.430]  Yeah.
[01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:02.430]  Oh, man.
[01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:03.430]  I missed that.
[01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.430]  Just smell the markers in class.
[01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:05.430]  You just gave me a weird flashback.
[01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:06.430]  But yeah, yeah.
[01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:09.430]  And I'm not a fan of that, so I put that to the Grateful Dog,
[01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:14.430]  and it made it more pungent and more piney, and then it brought out a bottom layer of fruit.
[01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:15.430]  That's it.
[01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:22.430]  And then I bred it to the King Kim Cross the Grape Stomper OG, and we call it the – well, it's the Blue Stomper.
[01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:28.430]  But that one made it much stinkier, and the King Kim Grape Stomper OG made little tiny popcorns,
[01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:30.430]  and now it makes spears since we put it to the Blue Dream.
[01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:31.430]  That's it.
[01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:32.430]  Yeah.
[01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:33.430]  This is what I tell people all the time.
[01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:34.430]  You know, I know you've had it.
[01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:37.430]  I know it's been around for a long time, held 15 years now,
[01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:39.430]  but don't count it out as a breeding mother with hybrids.
[01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:42.430]  You know, don't see Blue Dream on the label and automatically turn it away
[01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.430]  because you're probably passing up a really, really good cross.
[01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:47.430]  I know a lot of people that do not like Blue Dream at all.
[01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.430]  Shout out to those guys.
[01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:49.430]  They know who they are.
[01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:50.430]  I'm not going to say your names on the show.
[01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:51.430]  What up, boys?
[01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:54.430]  I don't know a lot of the nightmare lines people fell in love with and things like that.
[01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:59.430]  The reason why they called it Nightmare, where you think Nightmare, Dream, I mean, put two and two together.
[01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:01.430]  People didn't even know.
[01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:02.430]  Didn't know.
[01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:03.430]  Yeah.
[01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:05.430]  Then you tell them, like, no, there's no Blue Dream in there.
[01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:06.430]  All right.
[01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:11.430]  So something important I should mention, this is kind of a breeding by eye technique here.
[01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:13.430]  You could make allele charts.
[01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:15.430]  You could take a whole bunch of notes.
[01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:20.430]  You should take a whole bunch of notes either way, but this is kind of just a breeding with love.
[01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:25.430]  Grow from your heart, sort of do it by your eye, old school sort of thing.
[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:27.430]  We're breeding with a lot of experience here.
[01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:33.430]  So I think if you find a good male, you're going to want to do a pheno hunt of at least 20 seeds.
[01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:35.430]  You're going to want to find one with a good structure.
[01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:40.430]  You want it to look, you want it to have the shape that you want the babies to have.
[01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:42.430]  Find one that makes resin if you can.
[01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:44.430]  Find one that makes a whole bunch of pollen.
[01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:47.430]  If it doesn't make enough pollen, you're not going to make enough seeds.
[01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.430]  Find one with real close node spacing.
[01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:52.430]  Find one that smells real good.
[01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:57.430]  Try not to select the very first one that goes into flower and shows you that it's a boy.
[01:32:57.430 --> 01:33:02.430]  Definitely do not use any male plants that show any sign of hermaphrodism.
[01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:05.430]  Male plants can hermaphrodite also.
[01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:06.430]  You'll see pollen sacs.
[01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.430]  You'll see little male sacs popping out.
[01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:11.430]  And then right out of the sides, you'll see female pistils come out.
[01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:14.430]  Yeah, it's not, those aren't nut hairs.
[01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:16.430]  That's a hermaphroditic plant.
[01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:19.430]  You got to cut fucking Bruce Jenner down and get rid of it.
[01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:21.430]  Yeah, I just said that.
[01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.430]  I ain't afraid.
[01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:25.430]  You got to get Bruce Jenner out of there.
[01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:27.430]  We ain't trying to have none of that shit in the grow room.
[01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:28.430]  You got to get rid of it.
[01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:30.430]  That will create lots of problems in the future.
[01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:33.430]  You do not want to breed hermaphrodism into your plants.
[01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:34.430]  That's right.
[01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:37.430]  That is not a good, that's the exact opposite of what we're aiming for.
[01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:41.430]  So, yeah, and then pay attention to that pollen, you guys.
[01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:44.430]  And when the pollen does start spitting, you don't want that first grainy, sandy pollen.
[01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:48.430]  You want that, the pollen will, when you catch some of it and put it in your hand and rub it in the palm of your hand,
[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.430]  it'll feel smooth and silky.
[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:51.430]  It'll feel real nice.
[01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:55.430]  And then when you leave the grow room, you're going to have to hose yourself down.
[01:33:55.430 --> 01:34:00.430]  Get a mister, like a sprayer and spray, like a pump sprayer, like you'd almost use to pump pesticides.
[01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:05.430]  Get one of those and just spray yourself down and wash your hands because tap water works really great.
[01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:07.430]  It has chlorine, it's safe for everything, plants, animals, people.
[01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:08.430]  There you go.
[01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:10.430]  That'll deactivate any pollen that you've got on you.
[01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:16.430]  And then if you are going from that pollen room into a room that has female plants, you can always hose them down as you walk in.
[01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:20.430]  Just hit them with the sprayer and they won't receive pollen for a little while.
[01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:24.430]  Just try to prevent that pollen from getting onto your females if you don't want to breed.
[01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:33.430]  Because if you have a male plant in the house or in the room or in the facility with your females, it's going to try to get pollen everywhere.
[01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:38.430]  One thing I've noticed, where you can tell me if you've recognized this, I've got separate breeding rooms.
[01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:42.430]  I've got an upstairs and a downstairs area and an area over here and an area over here.
[01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:46.430]  And then I've got a male in one area and females in a totally different area.
[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:54.430]  I've noticed when I've got girls and a flowering male in the same house, the girls get a little stickier and they flower a little more quickly.
[01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:58.430]  Do you think those girls know there's a male around somewhere?
[01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:00.430]  Good question. That is a good question.
[01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:02.430]  It goes into some of my forte lighting.
[01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:04.430]  And it actually, yeah, they do.
[01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.430]  They know because of infrared lighting.
[01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:07.430]  Okay.
[01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:09.430]  Plants use infrared lighting to see around them.
[01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:11.430]  That's why you have natural spacing in the woods.
[01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:16.430]  That is why trees naturally space themselves out and naturally weed out smaller ones below them and around them.
[01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:21.430]  And you typically go into the woods and you pine tree forests and things like that and they have an equal spacing between trees.
[01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:22.430]  Yeah, they do.
[01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:23.430]  That is why.
[01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:24.430]  Okay.
[01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:25.430]  Infrared lighting.
[01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:27.430]  My horny girl plants know there's...
[01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:28.430]  She knows.
[01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:29.430]  She can stand upstairs blowing his load.
[01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:30.430]  They know.
[01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:31.430]  She's like, I want some of that.
[01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.430]  There's pheromones, I believe, as well.
[01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:34.430]  Okay.
[01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:35.430]  I would believe that.
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:38.430]  Well, they can take in CO2 and they breathe out carbon dioxide.
[01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:44.430]  There's always a constant intake between oxygen and carbon dioxide battling back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:45.430]  Right.
[01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:50.430]  And a lot of it, they're annual plants, so they built over thousands and millions of years beyond the surface.
[01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:53.430]  They have built defense mechanisms to try to breed.
[01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:54.430]  That is their purpose.
[01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:56.430]  That's why they're hermaphrodite on us when we fuck with them.
[01:35:56.430 --> 01:36:02.430]  If anybody remembers the first Jurassic Park, how the guy used to say nature will always find a way and then all of a sudden you have eggs.
[01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:05.430]  That is why, because nature will always find a way.
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:08.430]  And you're talking about something that is on a total different level than what you think.
[01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:17.430]  It's mind-boggling to think how, you know, in evolution sense, how far ahead some plants are than what we are.
[01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:19.430]  You know, we tend to think we are the kings of the world.
[01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:21.430]  You know, we're the center of the universe every day of the week.
[01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:26.430]  But really, if you look at an ant, if he was our size, he could lift your house.
[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:27.430]  Right.
[01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:28.430]  Yeah.
[01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:29.430]  They can lift like 500 times their natural weight.
[01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:31.430]  And start hiding in a smile at you with one arm holding your house.
[01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:33.430]  Go, ah, evolution.
[01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:37.430]  Because that's really what it is.
[01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.430]  You know, it's really more about perception than anything.
[01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.430]  You just fucked with all the listeners' heads.
[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:45.430]  Now they're just visualizing an ant lifting up my house and running away with it while we're in here recording.
[01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:47.430]  But it is.
[01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:50.430]  In reality, when you put it that way, I mean, it's how you perceive things.
[01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:52.430]  It's pretty wild, man.
[01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:54.430]  It's a wild universe out there.
[01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:56.430]  Yeah, the whole plant's mission is to survive.
[01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:57.430]  All right.
[01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.430]  So, man, you got anything else you want to add to this podcast?
[01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:02.430]  It sounds like we've covered selecting a male.
[01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:04.430]  I hope that made a lot of sense to you guys.
[01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:09.430]  Man, I just want everybody to show up and show Denver that we can do this better than they can.
[01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:11.430]  I really do.
[01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:18.430]  I think the people of Pueblo are going to show them that we've held the state fair here for how long?
[01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:26.430]  And somebody we know actually made a good point on social media that it's 11 days long, 25,000 people a day.
[01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:28.430]  If anybody can do it, Pueblo County can do it.
[01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:30.430]  Right. We can host that many folks.
[01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:32.430]  We got enough hotels, eating places.
[01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:33.430]  That's it.
[01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.430]  You guys, I actually plan to put together a podcast.
[01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:38.430]  I posted it up to social media asking my local friends for a little bit of help.
[01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:41.430]  I'm going to put a podcast together and be a little bit of a tour guide for you.
[01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:46.430]  I'm going to find places for you to stay, places for you to eat, things for you to do.
[01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:51.430]  Give you a little bit of information about our town so that when you come here, you're prepared.
[01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:55.430]  And then we can all have a good time and take a bunch of dabs and be friends, and you'll have a good time with us.
[01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:56.430]  It's going to be a blast.
[01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:57.430]  It's going to be such a blast.
[01:37:57.430 --> 01:38:00.430]  I'm proud to be here, man. That's all I can say.
[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:02.430]  I'm proud to have landed in this spot.
[01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:04.430]  They know we're holding the greatest party in the world.
[01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:07.430]  A lot of people talk a lot of trash, but look what's about to happen here.
[01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:08.430]  That's right.
[01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:12.430]  The biggest cannabis event on the planet is going to be here in our backyard.
[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:13.430]  I think it's going to be a blast, man.
[01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:16.430]  I know it's going to be a blast because I have fun everywhere I go.
[01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:18.430]  You're going to be there, and I'm going to be there.
[01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:20.430]  Jesse and Spencer are going to be there.
[01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:22.430]  What else do we need, bro? We're going to have a good-ass time.
[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:24.430]  Is Spencer competing this year?
[01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:25.430]  I can't speak for Spencer.
[01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:28.430]  Okay. Well, shout-out to Gardner Weed and Man Do It Boy.
[01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:30.430]  What's up, buddy? I hope you're listening to this.
[01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:32.430]  Shout-out to Maddie and the whole Gardner Weed and crew and Spence and the doggies.
[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.430]  What's up, Sirac Boy? What's up, Nana?
[01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:36.430]  I hope everybody's doing well over there.
[01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:38.430]  We just gave shout-outs to dogs on the podcast.
[01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:39.430]  That's pretty rad.
[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:42.430]  All right. Make sure you guys follow my buddy Sour Seeds on social media.
[01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:44.430]  How can people find you, bro?

[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:51.430]  We have our own website, www.mylehydink.co,
[01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:55.430]  which we'll be changing over to SourSeedCompany.com.
[01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.430]  We'll go to e-commerce.
[01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:03.430]  You can get our hat pins and get custom links right to our sites at Sour Seeds.
[01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:04.430]  Bro, thanks for the hat pins.
[01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:06.430]  You brought me a nice little selection of hat pins.
[01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:09.430]  I really like the dab scraper. That's pretty nice.
[01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:10.430]  I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
[01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:12.430]  I enjoy the art, man. I enjoy doing it.
[01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:14.430]  It just keeps everything fresh, man.
[01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:18.430]  Are your products available on thedankteam.com at this time?
[01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:19.430]  Not yet.
[01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:21.430]  Well, we got to get you in touch with our buddies over there.
[01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:22.430]  That would be great.
[01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:23.430]  Yeah, Yankee needs to talk to you.
[01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:26.430]  But make sure you guys check out thedankteam.com.
[01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:27.430]  Let them know that we sent you.
[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:29.430]  There's a little bit of iRegenetics stuff available.
[01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.430]  Go check that out.
[01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:32.430]  There's some Black Cherry Chem available up there.
[01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:33.430]  This is damn good, by the way.
[01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:34.430]  Well, thank you. Thank you.
[01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:36.430]  We grew some over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:39.430]  It'll be on the shelves by the time this podcast comes out.
[01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:40.430]  Very likely be gone.
[01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:44.430]  This has made some of the best concentrates I've had in Colorado, dude, honestly.
[01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:46.430]  I mean, I'd say top five.
[01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:47.430]  Well, damn, thank you.
[01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:48.430]  Just the flavors off.
[01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:49.430]  You can taste the cherry.
[01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:50.430]  You can taste the chem.
[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:51.430]  I really liked it.
[01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:52.430]  That Black Cherry comes through.
[01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:55.430]  It's like my two favorite, you know, two favorite herbs right there.
[01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:57.430]  That's why shit happens, brother.
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:59.430]  See, that's how breeding happens.
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:02.430]  You see two strains in a breeder that's bred as many times as we have,
[01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:04.430]  you can see what it's going to do.
[01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:07.430]  You're like, oh, if I put that to that, it's like becoming a chef.
[01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:08.430]  It's like a weird chef almost.
[01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:09.430]  It is.
[01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:10.430]  It's a lot of it.
[01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:11.430]  Yeah, it is.
[01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:12.430]  It's an art.
[01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:15.430]  There is some artistry involved in it, and don't ever let us think that we're taking that away.
[01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:16.430]  It's not just pure science.
[01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:19.430]  There's art to all of it, extractions, growing, breeding especially.
[01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:20.430]  Absolutely.
[01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:23.430]  It takes a good eye and a little bit of heart.
[01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:24.430]  You've got to listen to the plants.
[01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:26.430]  You've got to lay down next to them and listen to them.
[01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.430]  You've got to feel the vibe from the plants to help you out.
[01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:30.430]  Well, brother, thank you for coming out.
[01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:32.430]  Thanks for rolling some joints and smoking down.
[01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:33.430]  Yeah, I'll hit that sucker again.
[01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:35.430]  You looked at me like you want to hit this.
[01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:36.430]  Yeah, I do.
[01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.430]  I'm going to hit a joint, you guys.
[01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:39.430]  You guys fill your head with thoughts while I fill my head with smoke.
[01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:43.020]  There you go.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.020]  People think I don't smoke a lot of flour, but I've been smoking a lot of flour lately.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.020]  Yeah, it was me.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.020]  I'm guilty of that.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.020]  That's why I didn't just allow it.
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:53.020]  I wasn't just passing Bogart and over here.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.020]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:55.020]  Oh, no, man.
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.020]  That's how it is.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.020]  We're not the – once you get to that level, you just hold on to a joint for a few minutes
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.020]  and smoke it for a few minutes and pass it, and I'll smoke it for a few.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.020]  These are my new cigarettes.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.020]  Well, congrats on not smoking cigarettes.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.020]  Thank you.
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:06.020]  21 years clean sober.
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020]  Do it, guys.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020]  How long have you not had a cigarette now?
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020]  Almost two months.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.020]  Almost two months.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:14.020]  We mentioned that you had a problem one night on the show, and we didn't talk too much about it.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.020]  I just said that you were planning on coming, but you had a little issue.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:18.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:19.020]  I'll be honest.
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:20.020]  It's from smoking cigarettes.
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.020]  You smoke too much.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.020]  You collapse lung will happen.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.020]  Damn, son.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020]  Well, I'm way glad you're repairing back in it.
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.020]  I'm getting there.
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:28.020]  Getting there.
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:29.020]  You look good, bro.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020]  I look good.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.020]  I'm breathing good.
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.020]  I'm happy.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:33.020]  You want to go run some laps?
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.020]  I feel like I'm good.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.020]  Good.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.020]  Good.
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:37.020]  Good, good.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:38.020]  All right, man.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.020]  Well, thanks for spending some time with me, guys.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.020]  We're going to wrap up this part of the show.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.020]  We're going to take a bunch of dabs.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:44.020]  I'm going to take a break, and then I will be back to wrap up this show.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.020]  All right, you guys.
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:46.020]  That was a lesson in how to select male plants for breeding.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.020]  I hope you learned something.
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.020]  I want to send another huge thank you shout out to Rob.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.020]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.020]  Big shout out to everybody in the Sour Seeds crew.

[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:52.020]  I'm putting together an episode on how to get your MED badge so that you can work here
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.020]  in the Colorado marijuana industry legally.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.020]  I'm also putting together a tour guide episode.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.020]  The Cannabis Cup is coming to my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:56.020]  I'm going to be doing a tour guide episode.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.020]  I'm going to be doing a tour guide episode.

[01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:24.550]  Hey, what's up, everybody?
[01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:25.590]  Happy to be here.
[01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:26.430]  Well, thanks for coming, man.
[01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:28.090]  Thanks for taking some time away from the rig,
[01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:30.190]  away from the job, and especially away from the new baby.
[01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:31.310]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:32.150]  Happy to, man.
[01:48:32.150 --> 01:48:33.790]  I heard the kid ate potatoes today.
[01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:35.350]  He did, first potatoes.
[01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:36.990]  Shout out to the baby and the potatoes.
[01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:38.110]  Yep, shout out to mashed potatoes.
[01:48:38.110 --> 01:48:39.830]  Also, big shout out to the wife
[01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:42.470]  for taking some time and letting you come hang out.
[01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:43.750]  Yep, that's much appreciated.
[01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:45.310]  Thanks for taking a little man, baby.
[01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:46.150]  Thanks, Al.
[01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:46.970]  I'll be home in a little bit.
[01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:47.830]  I won't say your name on the show here,
[01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:49.670]  but thanks to Mike's wife for letting Mike come play.
[01:48:49.670 --> 01:48:51.150]  I appreciate you letting me borrow your husband
[01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:51.990]  for a little while.
[01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.810]  It's really cool.
[01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:53.890]  I appreciate it.
[01:48:53.890 --> 01:48:55.470]  All right, well, we'll quit talking about babies
[01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:56.670]  and we'll get on with the podcast, you guys.
[01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:57.510]  Thanks for jumping in.
[01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:59.830]  Thanks for joining the podcast.
[01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:01.230]  Let's see, where do we wanna start?
[01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:02.430]  I wanna give a big shout out
[01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:04.770]  to my friend, John Anthony Moses.
[01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:07.250]  I know you're hanging out, listening to the podcast.
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:08.090]  Thanks for listening, bro.
[01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.930]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.870]  Also, let's get into the big topic
[01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:15.190]  that's been going on here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:49:15.190 --> 01:49:18.670]  The Cannabis Cup was supposed to be in Denver on 420.
[01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:19.550]  Supposed to.
[01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:21.350]  Supposed to, but unfortunately,
[01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:23.270]  the city of Denver declined all of the permits.
[01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:24.490]  I'm not sure exactly.
[01:49:24.490 --> 01:49:26.270]  Denver officials declined all the permits.
[01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:27.110]  They were not allowed to host the event there.
[01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:30.070]  Adams County, I believe.
[01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:32.350]  Well, either way, they said, nope, not gonna do it.
[01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:34.230]  Nope, they had some issues,
[01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:37.870]  namely out-of-state dispensaries handing out samples
[01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:41.630]  and what was supposed to be 14,000 people a day
[01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:43.870]  actually being 35,000 people a day.
[01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:47.110]  All right, well, anyway, they said, no, not gonna happen.
[01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:47.950]  They're like, fuck you.
[01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:49.110]  I've been following this one close.
[01:49:49.110 --> 01:49:50.870]  High Times came down to Pueblo, Colorado,
[01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:52.070]  where Mike and I reside.
[01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:53.070]  Yes, they did.
[01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:55.350]  They claimed they were going to do the festival
[01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:59.390]  on the 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, within that range.
[01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:00.390]  That was the original goal.
[01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:01.850]  They put up flyers.
[01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:03.550]  They put out some announcements on their website.
[01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:06.630]  They put out some stuff on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
[01:50:06.630 --> 01:50:09.510]  And then suddenly, they retracted all of their statements
[01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:12.270]  and said, oh shit, the next weekend.
[01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:13.910]  So the permits have been entered.
[01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:15.630]  They've been submitted.
[01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:16.850]  They're being reviewed.
[01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:18.630]  So far, the city of Pueblo has not said
[01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:21.230]  if they are going to allow or decline
[01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:23.730]  the Cannabis Cup to happen in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:25.990]  This episode will come out in two or three days,
[01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:27.090]  and I'm pretty sure the decision
[01:50:27.090 --> 01:50:28.270]  will not be made at that time.
[01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:31.230]  So right now, there is no definite location
[01:50:31.230 --> 01:50:33.570]  for the High Times Cannabis Cup in Colorado.
[01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.710]  And if it does happen, it will be moved
[01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:39.350]  to the weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd.
[01:50:40.190 --> 01:50:42.590]  If it does happen in Pueblo, Colorado at all.
[01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:44.910]  Yeah, I read something today claiming
[01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:49.270]  that this move was, it was sort of an option B
[01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:52.110]  if Adams County didn't go through,
[01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:54.550]  and they'd been looking for bigger locations
[01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:56.110]  than the Denver Mart.
[01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:59.110]  And the location down here in Pueblo claims
[01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:02.030]  to be able to handle the 25 or 30,000 people a day,
[01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:03.270]  no problem, so.
[01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:04.750]  I'm not too familiar with the location.
[01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:06.050]  I thought Denver Mart was great,
[01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.890]  but of course, when I heard
[01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:08.430]  that it was going to be in Pueblo,
[01:51:08.430 --> 01:51:09.270]  I was excited to tell.
[01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:10.190]  Right, that's so awesome.
[01:51:10.190 --> 01:51:13.430]  That shaves a lot, A, a huge chunk of money
[01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:15.230]  out of going to the cup for people
[01:51:15.230 --> 01:51:17.030]  that just want to go to the cup.
[01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:18.910]  Yeah, you got to go up, you got to get a hotel room.
[01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:20.230]  You don't want to be driving back home
[01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:21.470]  to Pueblo after the cup.
[01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:24.350]  When it's a multiple day event,
[01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:25.570]  I have to go to every day,
[01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:26.410]  just because that's how I feel.
[01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:28.430]  Right, if you're trying to go to all three days
[01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:29.790]  or have to go to all three days,
[01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:31.870]  you got to be up there for, you know,
[01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:33.870]  paying top dollar for hotel rooms right now
[01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:35.030]  in Denver sucks.
[01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:37.430]  And all of the shitty hotels go expensive.
[01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:39.910]  If you think you're going to pay 70 or 80 for a hotel,
[01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:42.630]  those 70 and $80 hotels are now 130
[01:51:42.630 --> 01:51:43.830]  on Cannabis Cup weekend.
[01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.230]  Yep, every hotel in Denver knows
[01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:48.190]  that 420 is a big weekend in Denver
[01:51:48.190 --> 01:51:50.070]  and they cash the fuck in.
[01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.310]  Unfortunately, a bunch of people
[01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:52.790]  have already booked plane tickets.
[01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:54.870]  They've booked rooms, they've booked cars.
[01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:56.910]  The big complaint about the cup in Denver
[01:51:56.910 --> 01:52:00.470]  was always that the planning was sort of like a D minus.
[01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:03.630]  Like the roof didn't fall in, like nobody got squashed.
[01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:06.030]  But other than that, it was kind of a clusterfuck.
[01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:07.230]  Well, when they changed their mind
[01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.870]  that they weren't going to do it in Denver
[01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:10.110]  and they decided to move it to Pueblo,
[01:52:10.110 --> 01:52:12.870]  a lot of people were like, yeah, fuck Pueblo.
[01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:14.870]  Pueblo's got an interesting reputation out there.
[01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:16.230]  Yeah, we sure do, we sure do.
[01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:17.750]  But then when they pushed the date
[01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:19.510]  to a completely different weekend,
[01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:21.510]  I'm sure that a large portion of the people
[01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:23.390]  that were going to attend just decided, fuck it,
[01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:24.990]  they weren't even going to try.
[01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:27.070]  If the cup goes off in Pueblo,
[01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:29.350]  because it's not at all a sure thing at this point, folks,
[01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:31.550]  it's the decision comes down
[01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:34.310]  to the county planning department.
[01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:37.590]  And then if they decide yes, it can be appealed
[01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:39.990]  by any number of people.
[01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:42.670]  And our local sheriff has told the press
[01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:44.910]  that if it's approved, he's going to appeal
[01:52:46.110 --> 01:52:48.430]  because he doesn't have any idea
[01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:52.230]  how he's going to handle 35,000 Cannabis Cup attendees,
[01:52:52.230 --> 01:52:53.870]  not because of the number of attendees,
[01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:55.630]  but because they're attending the Cannabis Cup.
[01:52:55.630 --> 01:52:57.430]  Something about the event makes it special.
[01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:59.150]  We're going to be too high to drive.
[01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:00.390]  We're going to be too high to drive
[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:02.270]  is what I saw in a statement.
[01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:04.390]  They're really scared of dabs.
[01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:07.510]  Oh yeah, well, I mean, yeah, to the average,
[01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:09.670]  to a normal person who's never seen cannabis
[01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:11.590]  and sees me pull out a torch and heat up a nail
[01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:13.430]  and do this crack like looking drug,
[01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:15.590]  I can understand the fear, but he's a police officer.
[01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:16.550]  He's a sheriff.
[01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:18.150]  He needs to figure out what's going on
[01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:19.590]  with the medical marijuana community
[01:53:19.590 --> 01:53:21.670]  and be in touch with us and come join us
[01:53:21.670 --> 01:53:22.710]  instead of be afraid of us
[01:53:22.710 --> 01:53:24.550]  and try to persecute us and prosecute us.
[01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:27.390]  Right, spend 10 minutes talking to any member
[01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:29.910]  of the community and we will seem to be scary.
[01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:31.150]  Truth, I'm a peaceful dude.
[01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:32.110]  I may look intimidating.
[01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:34.270]  I may say a lot of big, crazy, weird words,
[01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:35.110]  but when it comes down to it,
[01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:36.230]  I'm a peaceful, chilled out dude.
[01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:37.750]  And I'd love to sit down and have a conversation
[01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:40.110]  with anybody who needs to be educated properly
[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:40.950]  about cannabis.
[01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:41.870]  That's what the show's all about.
[01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:43.070]  Cannabis edumacation.
[01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.990]  That's what today is.
[01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:47.670]  There was a lot of hilarity, I think, in this story.
[01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:51.070]  If you look at some of the reasons stated and quoted
[01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:54.350]  that the permits up in Denver were denied,
[01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:57.070]  the two big reasons that are cited over and over and over
[01:53:57.070 --> 01:54:00.950]  again in the press are, A, a woman jumped out of her car.
[01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:04.510]  Like somewhere in or around the cannabis cop
[01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:06.350]  or she had just attended or was on her way.
[01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:08.030]  It doesn't really specify.
[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:10.470]  But like clearly marijuana use doesn't cause
[01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:11.430]  jumping out of cars.
[01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:12.470]  No, I've smoked.
[01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:14.950]  People, if you know me.
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:16.670]  Like Colorado sold almost a billion dollars
[01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:17.510]  with weed last year.
[01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:21.510]  If it caused jumping out of cars, we would know.
[01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:23.710]  How many people have a medical marijuana car?
[01:54:23.710 --> 01:54:25.990]  There'd be that many people jumping out of cars.
[01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:28.950]  I smoke, I would have a good bet in saying
[01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:32.030]  I smoke more cannabis than 90% of the people
[01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:33.790]  on the planet.
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:35.310]  Right, like that's not an effect we wouldn't see
[01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:36.630]  for years down the road.
[01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:39.030]  If cannabis made you jump out of cars,
[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:41.110]  I would have done back flips out of buses by now.
[01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:43.590]  Right, and there were 35,000 people a day at the cop
[01:54:43.590 --> 01:54:45.110]  and one woman jumped out of a car.
[01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:47.630]  Like that's not exactly like event related.
[01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:50.790]  They forgot to mention in the article that she took a dab
[01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:52.910]  and then she went and did a whole bunch of molly
[01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:54.270]  and then she drank whiskey.
[01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:56.510]  And then there was all the other shit that helped her out.
[01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:57.510]  Dude, I've only ever heard of a chick jumping out of a car
[01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:59.350]  one other time and she was stone sober
[01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:00.710]  and fighting with her boyfriend.
[01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:04.150]  So like, there's a lot of non-consumed.
[01:55:04.150 --> 01:55:05.070]  Were you the boyfriend?
[01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:08.230]  Nope, I was friends with the boyfriend
[01:55:08.230 --> 01:55:09.710]  and they showed up, it's a long story,
[01:55:09.710 --> 01:55:10.750]  I'm not fucking telling it now.
[01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:11.590]  Let's not go there.
[01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:14.710]  But yeah, like that wasn't drug or alcohol related.
[01:55:14.710 --> 01:55:16.790]  That was I can't be in this car another minute
[01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:18.390]  fucking craziness longer.
[01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:21.230]  So if you do come to Colorado and you come to Pueblo,
[01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:23.070]  if we do have the cannabis cup here,
[01:55:23.070 --> 01:55:24.710]  please behave yourself, represent yourself
[01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:28.390]  as a positive cannabis user and a responsible cannabis user.
[01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:30.270]  Be careful, they're going to be looking for people
[01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:31.670]  who are driving too high.
[01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:32.870]  Check it out, let's talk about this a little bit.
[01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.110]  I don't know the exact rule here,
[01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:36.190]  but they treat cannabis like alcohol.
[01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:38.190]  If you're going to be leaving the cannabis cup,
[01:55:38.190 --> 01:55:40.310]  have your cannabis in a sealed container.
[01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:42.230]  If you can put it in the trunk of your car,
[01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:45.470]  put your rig, your dabber, your carb cap,
[01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:47.590]  your torch and especially your product,
[01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:49.510]  any product you've got that's smokable,
[01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:51.270]  edible, drinkable.
[01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.190]  If it's cannabis infused related,
[01:55:53.190 --> 01:55:54.790]  if you can rub it on your balls,
[01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:55.990]  put it in the trunk of the car.
[01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:57.910]  If you don't have a trunk, if you've got an SUV,
[01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:59.870]  put it in the backpack, zip the backpack up,
[01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:01.790]  put it way in the back of the vehicle.
[01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:03.950]  Have it out of reach of the driver.
[01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:07.270]  Don't get yourself a DUI or an illegal possession
[01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:09.030]  of cannabis ticket because that is still
[01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:11.310]  a possible thing here in Colorado.
[01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:16.070]  This cannabis cup, if it goes off in Pueblo,
[01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:18.830]  is going to be under a lot of scrutiny.
[01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:21.310]  And honestly, Pueblo could use a cup down here
[01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:23.430]  and I'd really like to see the event do well
[01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:24.870]  if it gets approved at all.
[01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:26.550]  I would love to see it do well.
[01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:28.470]  One of the big complaints in Adams County
[01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:30.390]  was out of state dispensaries coming here
[01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:33.710]  and selling weed and dabs at their booths.
[01:56:33.710 --> 01:56:36.470]  Some of them were doing donation,
[01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:41.430]  legal mumble jumbo, other people were straight doing sales.
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:42.630]  That's illegal.
[01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:45.030]  At least according to recent reports.
[01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:46.350]  And yeah, that's a big no-no here,
[01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:48.270]  which is why none of our local dispensaries
[01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:50.990]  were even handing out product at the cup.
[01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:52.950]  I get that the cup is supposed to be
[01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:54.750]  the community gathering and celebrating
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.710]  and having a huge smokeout,
[01:56:56.710 --> 01:56:59.350]  but how you hand out samples
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:01.070]  or what people bring to smoke,
[01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:02.430]  there's a lot of rules around that.
[01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:06.190]  You need to know the law and please try to comply with it,
[01:57:06.190 --> 01:57:07.870]  like as much as practicable.
[01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:08.910]  Be careful, please.
[01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:09.870]  Please don't fuck it up for us.
[01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:11.150]  We've worked really hard here to do this.
[01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:12.830]  We've got a good thing going.
[01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:13.670]  Come have a good time.
[01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:14.550]  I'm not trying to be a dick about it.
[01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:16.750]  Come when you're at the event, take dabs,
[01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:17.830]  share your dabs with your friends.
[01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.790]  Give me a fat dab, take a fat dab with me,
[01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:21.350]  high five me, let's take some selfies,
[01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:22.470]  let's get on Instagram together,
[01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:24.070]  let's Snapchat it the fuck up.
[01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:25.950]  But be careful when you're driving away from there,
[01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:28.870]  keep your cannabis safe, keep your eyes not red,
[01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:31.350]  be able to walk the line, be able to pass the tests.
[01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:33.070]  Remember we did the episode a little while back
[01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:34.910]  about interacting with law enforcement,
[01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:36.390]  be prepared for that shit.
[01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:38.270]  If you're a nervous person,
[01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:40.110]  don't be extra high and nervous
[01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:41.110]  when you're leaving the cup.
[01:57:41.110 --> 01:57:42.790]  Hang out for an extra hour.
[01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:43.630]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:45.150]  If you take a couple dabs, hang out for an hour.
[01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:47.230]  When I went back and listened to that episode,
[01:57:47.230 --> 01:57:50.230]  the one thing I realized I meant to emphasize and didn't
[01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:52.590]  was the easiest way to not get in trouble
[01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:54.630]  with law enforcement and to be calm and cool
[01:57:54.630 --> 01:57:58.470]  during those interactions is to not be breaking the law.
[01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:59.950]  You know, that's something my buddy Louis,
[01:57:59.950 --> 01:58:01.190]  shout out Magoo, he goes,
[01:58:01.190 --> 01:58:03.070]  you know what you forgot to fucking mention was
[01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:04.510]  don't have fucking expired plates,
[01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.150]  don't have your tags expired,
[01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:07.270]  don't have a broken headlight,
[01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:08.270]  don't have a broken taillight,
[01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:10.310]  don't be an asshole, don't have a cracked windshield.
[01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:13.350]  He said break one rule at a time was his advice.
[01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:14.550]  So shout out to Magoo for pointing that out for us.
[01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:16.110]  I grew up in a lawyer family,
[01:58:16.110 --> 01:58:18.630]  like if you haven't figured that out yet by now,
[01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:20.230]  I don't know if you've been listening.
[01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:22.890]  But that's an old lawyer joke is like,
[01:58:22.890 --> 01:58:25.650]  if you've got to break the law, break one law at a time.
[01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:27.130]  And it's fucking true.
[01:58:27.130 --> 01:58:28.450]  Like if you've got weed in the car
[01:58:28.450 --> 01:58:29.470]  and you ain't allowed to have weed,
[01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:31.610]  make sure that that's the only rule you're breaking.
[01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:34.490]  If you're speeding, you're asking to get caught.
[01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:37.130]  If you've got a fucked up car, you're asking to get caught.
[01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:38.250]  Truth.
[01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.770]  In a lot of states, if you look like Jeff,
[01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:40.610]  you're asking to get caught.
[01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:43.890]  Hey, hey, and by what, some of the listeners don't know,
[01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:44.890]  some of the listeners,
[01:58:44.890 --> 01:58:46.410]  this gets pointed out to me occasionally,
[01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:48.250]  some listeners don't know this.
[01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:50.170]  When people meet me or they hear my voice somewhere
[01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:51.570]  and they turn around and like, is that you?
[01:58:51.570 --> 01:58:53.050]  Because I go to the grocery store sometimes
[01:58:53.050 --> 01:58:55.170]  and people like, dude, that's fucking you.
[01:58:55.170 --> 01:58:57.370]  You guys, I am six foot five
[01:58:57.370 --> 01:59:00.770]  and I've got dreadlocks almost to my knees.
[01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:01.930]  I am not even joking.
[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:04.330]  My dreadlocks go damn near to my knees.
[01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:06.330]  Now I can close them in the car door.
[01:59:06.330 --> 01:59:07.810]  I used to roll them up in the car window,
[01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:09.050]  but now they're so long that that shit
[01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:10.530]  isn't even thought about.
[01:59:11.610 --> 01:59:13.010]  Yeah, they're long.
[01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:14.250]  Testify for me, Mike.
[01:59:14.250 --> 01:59:15.090]  These fucking things.
[01:59:15.090 --> 01:59:16.810]  They're ridiculous.
[01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:18.170]  With a gentle weave,
[01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:20.370]  they could be like a legit hammock or blanket.
[01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:23.410]  This one here is bigger around than my torch.
[01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:26.210]  I've watched them steal things from other people's hands
[01:59:26.210 --> 01:59:28.490]  without Jeff's knowledge or consent.
[01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:29.930]  Oh, my dreads will clean off a table.
[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:31.610]  Dude, they work like a bullwhip from time to time.
[01:59:31.610 --> 01:59:32.450]  It gets hilarious.
[01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:33.290]  They're really long.
[01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:34.130]  If I need space at a concert,
[01:59:34.130 --> 01:59:35.890]  I just shake the dreadlocks around a little bit
[01:59:35.890 --> 01:59:37.690]  and then no one wants my dreadlocks in their face
[01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:38.530]  and or their beer,
[01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:39.530]  so they just back the fuck up
[01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:40.890]  and give me some dancing room.
[01:59:40.890 --> 01:59:44.330]  In Colorado, it's not that unusual to see some dreadlocks.
[01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:46.690]  It's really unusual to see locks this long.
[01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:48.490]  All right.
[01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:49.970]  But yeah, in other states,
[01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:52.170]  you're a walking advertisement for a dude that's high.
[01:59:52.170 --> 01:59:54.730]  Yeah, oh, you should see me try to go through the TSA,
[01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:55.570]  going through the airport.
[01:59:55.570 --> 01:59:56.410]  Right.
[01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:57.250]  They inspect my dreadlocks.
[01:59:57.250 --> 01:59:58.330]  They fucking wanna squeeze them
[01:59:58.330 --> 01:59:59.650]  and see what's in there, honey.
[01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:00.490]  Yeah.
[02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:02.490]  So you guys, if you're coming to the Cannabis Cup,
[02:00:02.490 --> 02:00:03.610]  be careful.
[02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:04.450]  Look out at the cup.
[02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:05.270]  Have a good time.
[02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:06.110]  I will be there.
[02:00:06.110 --> 02:00:06.930]  Look for me.
[02:00:06.930 --> 02:00:08.370]  I'm gonna do a shameless shout out here.
[02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:09.770]  Since the Cannabis Cup in Denver
[02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:13.250]  will not be on the day of 420,
[02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:15.570]  everyone's looking for something to do on 420 in Denver.
[02:00:15.570 --> 02:00:17.050]  I wanna give a huge shout out to an event
[02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:18.690]  called The Secret Sesh.
[02:00:18.690 --> 02:00:20.850]  The Secret Sesh will be happening at the Gatsby Gardens
[02:00:20.850 --> 02:00:22.410]  in Denver, Colorado on 420.
[02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:24.610]  And I do invite you to join us.
[02:00:24.610 --> 02:00:25.430]  For more information,
[02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:27.650]  you're gonna have to follow The Secret Sesh Colorado
[02:00:27.650 --> 02:00:28.490]  on Instagram.
[02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:29.970]  Search them out.
[02:00:29.970 --> 02:00:31.150]  We will get a website going.
[02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:32.370]  There's more happening.
[02:00:32.370 --> 02:00:34.770]  Our homie Adam L will be coming out to DJ,
[02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:35.970]  or not to DJ, to host the show.
[02:00:35.970 --> 02:00:36.810]  I apologize.
[02:00:36.810 --> 02:00:38.290]  I'm not sure if I can announce who the DJ will be.
[02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:39.130]  I'm excited.
[02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:40.970]  I know who the DJ is, I think.
[02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:42.130]  I think we've got him lined up,
[02:00:42.130 --> 02:00:44.250]  but I don't wanna say the name of the DJ on the show here
[02:00:44.250 --> 02:00:45.210]  and get everybody pumped up
[02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:46.690]  because it's a good DJ.
[02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:48.010]  You guys will recognize his name when I say it.
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:49.290]  If you're a fan of the podcast,
[02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:50.810]  you might know who I'm talking about.
[02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:52.250]  And it is not Nickatee.
[02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:54.170]  So I'm just gonna cross that one off.
[02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:55.570]  A lot of people might think I have Nickatee
[02:00:55.570 --> 02:00:57.270]  coming to DJ an event, but we do not.
[02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:59.090]  So big shout out to the Grimey Gatsby.
[02:00:59.090 --> 02:01:01.330]  Big shout out to The Secret Sesh.
[02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:02.830]  We wanna get The Secret Sesh packed up.
[02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:03.670]  We want you there.
[02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:04.810]  Come check it out.
[02:01:04.810 --> 02:01:05.650]  All right.
[02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:08.130]  So we do have a topic for this episode.
[02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:09.470]  It's not just gonna be two high guys
[02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:11.610]  taking dabs and rambling.
[02:01:11.610 --> 02:01:12.650]  We got the topic.
[02:01:12.810 --> 02:01:15.730]  Our friend, she calls herself That One Mountain Girl,
[02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:17.810]  sent me a message on Instagram and she said,
[02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:19.410]  "'Hey, you guys should do a message
[02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:21.770]  "'about how to get your badge in Colorado.'"
[02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:23.690]  So big shout out to That One Mountain Girl
[02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:24.970]  for listening to the podcast.
[02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:27.850]  Also big shout out for following me on IG.
[02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:30.990]  Man, today, and today it happened to a lot of people,
[02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:32.770]  but I noticed several Instagram accounts
[02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:34.370]  got wiped the fuck out.
[02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:36.350]  The Green and Healthy Wellness Instagram account
[02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:38.090]  for the shop, buh-bye.
[02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:41.250]  The Terpex account for their hash, buh-bye.
[02:01:41.250 --> 02:01:42.530]  I'm afraid to open mine right now
[02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:44.210]  and look if it's even there,
[02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:45.170]  because I mean, that's my crew, you know what I mean?
[02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:47.370]  I grow the herb for green and healthy,
[02:01:47.370 --> 02:01:48.730]  and then it's blasted by Terpex,
[02:01:48.730 --> 02:01:51.050]  and we're all tagged in the same posts.
[02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:53.610]  So I feel like my time's coming on Instagram.
[02:01:53.610 --> 02:01:54.730]  You guys, if it disappears,
[02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:56.530]  I'll just create a Rasta Jeff Instagram.
[02:01:56.530 --> 02:01:58.170]  It won't even be iRegenetics anymore.
[02:01:58.170 --> 02:01:59.330]  It'll be Rasta Jeff this time.
[02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:02.410]  It'll be the second iRegenetics Instagram
[02:02:02.410 --> 02:02:03.730]  to get blasted down.
[02:02:03.730 --> 02:02:05.730]  So I'll just make a Rasta Jeff if it disappears.
[02:02:05.730 --> 02:02:06.570]  I'll let you know.
[02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:07.390]  It's until then.
[02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:08.810]  Dedicated Instagrammers good on ya.
[02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:09.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:10.470]  Oh, I love Instagram.
[02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:11.310]  It's fun.
[02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:12.150]  I like to post pictures of what's going on
[02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:13.950]  with my friends and my family out there.
[02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:15.830]  So big shout out to that one mountain girl.
[02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:18.230]  Also, shout out to my friend Jessica.
[02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:20.550]  She kind of encouraged me to write this episode.
[02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:23.350]  She is a manager at a very prominent dispensary
[02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:25.150]  in the Colorado Springs area.
[02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:27.790]  Big shout out to her and her staff and her dispensary.
[02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:29.110]  Not gonna say the name of the dispensary.
[02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:29.950]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:30.790]  I should've.
[02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:31.610]  She got a mini shout out.
[02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:32.450]  He got a shout out, Jess.
[02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:33.370]  Big love, big hugs.
[02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:36.550]  But Jess was like, you should do an episode.
[02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:38.830]  No, we had a friend doing this,
[02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:39.950]  going through the same thing,
[02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:42.310]  and I thought about we should do a show for that.
[02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:43.150]  Right, yeah.
[02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:45.190]  Well, Jessica deals with people at the dispensary every day,
[02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:47.310]  and one person a day asks how do,
[02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:48.830]  yeah, and Mike works at a dispensary too,
[02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:51.390]  and Mike and Jess both have one person a day say,
[02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:52.310]  how do I get a badge?
[02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:53.150]  How do I get a badge?
[02:02:53.150 --> 02:02:54.430]  How do I get a badge?
[02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:56.950]  So now all they have to do is refer that person
[02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:57.790]  to this episode.
[02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:59.070]  Welcome new listener.
[02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:01.110]  If you learned about the podcast by somebody saying,
[02:03:01.110 --> 02:03:01.950]  hey, listen to that.
[02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:02.910]  You'll learn how to get your badge.
[02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:03.750]  Welcome.
[02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:04.590]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:05.410]  I'm Rasta Jeff.
[02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:06.390]  Cross the table is my buddy, White Mike.
[02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:07.230]  What up?
[02:03:07.230 --> 02:03:08.510]  We're gonna teach you how to get your badge.
[02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:09.770]  I took a bunch of notes.
[02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:12.310]  So I'm gonna open the notes.
[02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:13.150]  I'm gonna find them.
[02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:13.970]  Here we go.
[02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:14.990]  It says how to get your badge in Colorado,
[02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:17.150]  and this is how to get a Colorado
[02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:19.110]  marijuana enforcement division badge
[02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:21.430]  so that you're able to work in a legal,
[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:24.150]  recreational, and or medical marijuana facility.
[02:03:24.150 --> 02:03:25.990]  This could be a dispensary
[02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:27.870]  where you're either rolling joints all day,
[02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:29.430]  where you're a bud tender.
[02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:30.270]  If you're going to be-
[02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:32.190]  There's a million different types of jobs
[02:03:32.190 --> 02:03:34.950]  at dispensaries, but be prepared to start
[02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:37.030]  at the bottom of the ladder kind of regardless.
[02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:38.190 --> 02:03:39.430]  Like unless you're coming with $2 million.
[02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:40.790]  But anything you're gonna do in there,
[02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:42.510]  you need a badge from the owner
[02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:44.590]  to the bud tender to the joint roller.
[02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:46.470]  To the dude who paints the walls.
[02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:50.070]  Yeah, to the lawyer needs a badge.
[02:03:50.070 --> 02:03:51.630]  The guys that come in and build the place
[02:03:51.630 --> 02:03:55.150]  have to get either real badges or visitor badges.
[02:03:55.150 --> 02:03:58.210]  So all the people that work for the dispensary,
[02:03:58.210 --> 02:04:00.990]  the grows, the processing facilities
[02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:02.150]  where extracts are made,
[02:04:02.150 --> 02:04:04.390]  the facilities where edibles and drinkables are made,
[02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:06.270]  the places where topicals are made,
[02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:08.310]  even the testing facilities where the cannabis
[02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:10.070]  is tested for cannabinoids,
[02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:11.410]  they all are required to have
[02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.950]  a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division badge,
[02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:17.470]  which requires a thorough FBI background check,
[02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:19.310]  fingerprints, and an intensive,
[02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:21.430]  intensive application process.
[02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:23.110]  If you don't meet the requirements,
[02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:25.150]  you're not gonna get a badge.
[02:04:25.150 --> 02:04:25.990]  We'll get to that.
[02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.870]  We'll get to that.
[02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:29.590]  So let's talk about the steps on how to get this badge.
[02:04:29.590 --> 02:04:30.950]  Because if you want to work at a dispensary,
[02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:33.030]  this is the first thing that you need to do.
[02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:34.990]  And this is really, really important
[02:04:34.990 --> 02:04:37.550]  if you're thinking about moving here to work in legal weed,
[02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:39.350]  know this before you move.
[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:42.070]  Yes, there's one step in here that you'll need to know
[02:04:42.070 --> 02:04:42.910]  and we'll get to it.
[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:43.730]  I'm excited to get to it.
[02:04:43.730 --> 02:04:44.990]  Because it's one of the, I did a lot of,
[02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:46.610]  a lot of research and it was one of my favorite parts
[02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:47.450]  to get to.
[02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:49.030]  There's a buttload of people who moved here
[02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:50.710]  that didn't know how to do none of this
[02:04:50.710 --> 02:04:53.430]  and don't meet the requirements and so they're fucked.
[02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.830]  Yeah.
[02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:56.310]  Or they're stuck trying to get a job
[02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:58.190]  doing whatever it was they were doing
[02:04:58.190 --> 02:05:00.230]  that they hated so much they moved across the country
[02:05:00.230 --> 02:05:01.590]  to work in legal weed.
[02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:03.910]  Or they're trying to set up a black market grow to survive.
[02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:04.750]  Right.
[02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:05.570]  And they're struggling.
[02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:06.410]  All right, so the first thing you gotta do
[02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:08.950]  if you wanna get a badge here in the state of Colorado,
[02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:12.270]  you have got to find the application online.
[02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:13.950]  And I will put the application in the show notes.
[02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:16.030]  I'll put a link to the application.
[02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:18.110]  Let me read you the website address.
[02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.230]  If you've got a pen and paper
[02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:21.270]  or if you wanna type this into your web browser quickly,
[02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:26.110]  it is colorado.gov slash Pacific, the word Pacific.
[02:05:26.110 --> 02:05:30.230]  Yes, colorado.gov slash Pacific slash enforcement
[02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:35.230]  slash medical dash marijuana dash occupational
[02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:36.870]  dash licensing.
[02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:40.630]  So it's colorado.gov slash Pacific slash enforcement
[02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:44.470]  slash medical dash marijuana dash occupational licensing.
[02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:46.270]  So long as URL.
[02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:48.070]  Yeah, well, hopefully somebody type that
[02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:49.190]  into their web browser.
[02:05:49.190 --> 02:05:50.670]  Hopefully somebody got that, wrote it down.
[02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:51.930]  I'll put it in the show notes,
[02:05:51.930 --> 02:05:53.750]  but that's where you need to go to get the application.
[02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:54.950]  That's where you start.
[02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:58.150]  It's not super hard to find if you just Google it by name.
[02:05:58.190 --> 02:06:00.390]  Right, there are a lot of things to filter through though.
[02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:02.230]  It's confusing on what you're looking for.
[02:06:02.230 --> 02:06:03.990]  Yeah, it does take a minute of reading
[02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:05.550]  and kind of clicking around
[02:06:05.550 --> 02:06:07.550]  to find the actual application that you need
[02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:08.990]  because they've got like four of them posted.
[02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:11.230]  Right, and you're looking for either a key badge
[02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.310]  or a support badge.
[02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:14.050]  And we'll talk about that in just a couple of seconds.
[02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:16.070]  I think I made a note to talk about that.
[02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:20.370]  So find the application, read and review the application.
[02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:22.310]  You'll get to a part that says,
[02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:24.710]  this marijuana occupational employee application form
[02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:25.910]  is an official document.
[02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:27.350]  If you provide false information
[02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:29.030]  on your marijuana license application
[02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:31.070]  and or do not disclose all information
[02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:32.510]  the application asks,
[02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:35.310]  your license is subject to denial or revocation
[02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:38.470]  and you may be subject to criminal prosecution.
[02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:39.830]  The marijuana enforcement division
[02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:41.830]  will conduct a complete background investigation
[02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:43.790]  and will check all sources of information.
[02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:45.550]  You are advised that it is better
[02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:47.230]  to disclose all information
[02:06:47.230 --> 02:06:51.550]  than face denial, revocation or criminal prosecution.
[02:06:51.550 --> 02:06:53.790]  So guys, they're not bullshitting when they say that.
[02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:56.150]  I know a guy named Tim who has been waiting months
[02:06:56.150 --> 02:06:57.470]  and months for his badge
[02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:59.590]  because they are doing a thorough investigation.
[02:06:59.590 --> 02:07:01.510]  They found some stuff on his record.
[02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:03.350]  They're contacting the state where that happened.
[02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:04.990]  They're talking to the actual judge
[02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:07.210]  that resided over my friend's case
[02:07:07.210 --> 02:07:09.630]  to find out if he can get his badge or not.
[02:07:09.630 --> 02:07:10.510]  And it's been a long time.
[02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:11.830]  He writes them letters all the time
[02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:13.670]  and they reply with, we're still investigating, sir.
[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:14.750]  We'll get back to you.
[02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:15.830]  So they're not bullshitting.
[02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:16.990]  They're gonna go through this.
[02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:18.630]  They're not kidding.
[02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.070]  Disclose your shit.
[02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:22.750]  So it says, if you need clarification
[02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:24.110]  of any of the following questions,
[02:07:24.110 --> 02:07:27.310]  please contact any marijuana enforcement division office.
[02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:29.190]  So that means if it's not clear to you,
[02:07:29.190 --> 02:07:30.030]  call them because they do not want you lying.
[02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:33.030]  They're happy to tell you exactly what's up.
[02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:35.950]  And when we get into the requirements in a minute,
[02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:37.750]  like we'll get more specific,
[02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.230]  but like really just tell the truth.
[02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:40.390]  There's no fudge in this.
[02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:41.830]  Yep, know the requirements.
[02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:43.830]  If you don't meet them straight up, don't try
[02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:45.110]  because you ain't gonna get passed.
[02:07:45.110 --> 02:07:46.710]  And if you do, it's a special crime.
[02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:48.350]  This is the age of the internet.
[02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:50.830]  And if you did some shit, it's on paper.
[02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:51.830]  Just write it down.
[02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:54.550]  They really don't care as long as it violates
[02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:55.630]  the couple of requirements.
[02:07:55.630 --> 02:07:57.950]  And they play those straight up and down for the most part.
[02:07:57.950 --> 02:08:01.230]  I've only heard one person who didn't get their badge
[02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:03.270]  and they tried to make it sound like a big conspiracy.
[02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:04.310]  And it was like, no dude,
[02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:06.110]  it was that felony three years ago.
[02:08:06.110 --> 02:08:07.470]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:09.630]  Well, let's read the disqualifying conditions.
[02:08:09.630 --> 02:08:12.270]  It says, these questions go like this.
[02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:15.670]  Have you ever discharged a sentence for a conviction
[02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:18.390]  of a felony pursuant to any state or federal law
[02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:20.990]  regarding the possession, distribution, manufacturing,
[02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:23.590]  cultivation, or use of a controlled substance,
[02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:26.350]  including probation or parole within the last 10 years,
[02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:29.630]  even if the conviction occurred more than 10 years ago?
[02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:31.710]  So that means have you been in jail for any felony?
[02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:32.550]  Does that what that means?
[02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:33.550]  Discharge the sentence?
[02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:35.630]  That's no drug felonies in 10 years
[02:08:35.630 --> 02:08:37.470]  is what that question's asking about.
[02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:41.150]  Like you have to have completed the jail sentence
[02:08:41.150 --> 02:08:44.390]  and any probation or parole at least 10 years
[02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:47.270]  before you apply for your MED badge.
[02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:50.190]  So 10 years ago, you guys, if you've had a drug felony.
[02:08:50.190 --> 02:08:51.030]  10 years, it's like-
[02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:52.030]  Drug felony.
[02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:54.270]  Let's be specific, it says drug felony.
[02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:56.950]  So you had to have drugs involved in your felony
[02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:59.470]  and it has to be more than 10 years ago if that happened.
[02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:02.790]  If it was nine years and 365 days,
[02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:04.230]  cause it's fucking leap year,
[02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:07.510]  then you're still not able to qualify.
[02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:09.870]  You gotta wait another day and then apply.
[02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:11.950]  So condition number two,
[02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:15.110]  have you served a sentence including probation, parole,
[02:09:15.110 --> 02:09:18.070]  within the last five years upon conviction for any felony,
[02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:21.230]  even if the conviction occurred more than five years ago?
[02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:23.270]  So once again, if you're on probation or parole
[02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:26.230]  five years ago or within the last five years,
[02:09:26.230 --> 02:09:27.910]  you are not allowed to work in the industry.
[02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:32.190]  So no drug felonies in 10, no felonies period in five.
[02:09:32.190 --> 02:09:33.430]  Or probation or parole.
[02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:34.950]  Yep, and the probation and parole
[02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:37.150]  for many of those felonies has to be done
[02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:38.470]  at least that many years ago.
[02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:39.510]  And then this one is neat.
[02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:41.070]  Are you a licensed physician
[02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:43.030]  making patient recommendations?
[02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:45.070]  Yep, if you're a doctor in the industry,
[02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:47.550]  you can't be affiliated with a dispensary
[02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:48.790]  if you're involved with that part of it.
[02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:50.070]  So you don't need a badge.
[02:09:50.070 --> 02:09:51.510]  That makes good sense.
[02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:52.630]  I understand why that's a rule.
[02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:53.990]  That rule kind of makes sense.
[02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:56.070]  And I really get where they're going with the felony rule.
[02:09:56.070 --> 02:09:57.750]  They're really trying to play it
[02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:01.870]  so that the state can say with all reassurance
[02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:05.550]  that people who were dealing drugs in the past
[02:10:05.550 --> 02:10:07.670]  aren't owning dispensaries.
[02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:09.990]  And an easy way to do that is to make sure
[02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:12.070]  that anyone convicted of selling drugs
[02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.750]  doesn't get to be a dispensary owner
[02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:15.270]  for at least the first decade.
[02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:18.230]  And yeah, that kind of sucks
[02:10:18.230 --> 02:10:19.990]  for people who got busted back in the day
[02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:22.190]  and they're now trying to be totally straight up legal,
[02:10:22.190 --> 02:10:25.150]  but that's how Colorado wants to play it.
[02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:25.990]  And this physician part,
[02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:27.910]  they just don't want you to be a doctor
[02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:28.750]  hanging out in a dispensary.
[02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:30.590]  Yep, they've quashed that a long time ago.
[02:10:30.590 --> 02:10:31.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:32.750]  All right, number four says,
[02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:35.510]  have you had your authority to act as primary caregiver
[02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:37.870]  revoked by the state health agency?
[02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:40.390]  So if you were somebody's primary caregiver
[02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:43.190]  as not under the medical marijuana type of caregiver,
[02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:45.110]  but as their caregiver for somebody who is elderly
[02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:46.790]  or disabled, if that's been revoked,
[02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:49.270]  you are not allowed to work in the cannabis industry.
[02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:52.030]  The next question is, are you under 21 years of age?
[02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:54.790]  You have to be 21 years old when you apply.
[02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:56.190]  Yep, gotta be 21.
[02:10:56.190 --> 02:10:58.110]  That's not too hard to figure out, 21.
[02:10:58.110 --> 02:11:00.750]  The next question says, or not question,
[02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:02.030]  but let me take a sip here.
[02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.990]  Hold on, talk, Mike.
[02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:05.790]  I don't know what the next question is,
[02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:09.190]  but I can guess student loans and child support.
[02:11:09.190 --> 02:11:10.470]  Not yet.
[02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:11.870]  Nope, those are further down the list.
[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:13.190]  Sorry for the teaser.
[02:11:13.190 --> 02:11:14.430]  No, that'll come up in a little bit though.
[02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:15.910]  That's not on this list.
[02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:16.950]  Thanks for the time to take a drink.
[02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:17.790]  Excuse me.
[02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:18.630]  It says, are you the-
[02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:19.630]  Sorry for the shitty film.
[02:11:19.630 --> 02:11:20.790]  Are you the spouse?
[02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:21.790]  You were under pressure, bro.
[02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:22.630]  That's cool.
[02:11:22.630 --> 02:11:24.470]  Are you the spouse or child living in the household
[02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:25.510]  of any person employed
[02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:28.030]  by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division?
[02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:29.470]  So if your mom-
[02:11:29.470 --> 02:11:30.910]  No working for both sides.
[02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:31.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:32.590]  If your mom-
[02:11:32.590 --> 02:11:35.270]  You can't be a regulator and a profiteer.
[02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:36.430]  Your mom works at the MED.
[02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:38.430]  You can't have a badge, sorry.
[02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:42.630]  Tell mom that she's gotta like disown you or something.
[02:11:42.630 --> 02:11:44.350]  So you can go get your badge.
[02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:45.990]  Probably don't do that.
[02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.830]  Tell her to switch sides.
[02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:47.790]  Tell her to get on the right team.
[02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:48.750]  Tell her to join the force.
[02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:51.590]  There's special rules to prevent that from happening
[02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:53.830]  for a chunk of years when you join the MED now
[02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:57.510]  because a bunch of people were going to work for the MED,
[02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:58.710]  going through training,
[02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:00.670]  doing a bunch of MED inspections
[02:12:00.670 --> 02:12:01.910]  for like three or four months,
[02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:03.510]  and then getting a job at a dispensary
[02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:06.990]  for like 10 times the pay to be a compliance officer
[02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:09.710]  because they could put on their resume, MED officer.
[02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:11.150]  Oh wow, that's a good idea.
[02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:13.470]  And so it was happening so much,
[02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:17.310]  the MED had to pass special like non-compete clause rules
[02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:19.070]  that they have to sign contracts
[02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:20.910]  when they get their job at the MED now.
[02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:21.750]  That's pretty good.
[02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:22.590]  I like it.
[02:12:22.590 --> 02:12:23.430]  I like it.
[02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:26.150]  And then the next one, and the last one,
[02:12:26.150 --> 02:12:28.510]  are you a sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer,
[02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:31.390]  or prosecuting officer, or any officer or employee
[02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:33.230]  of the Marijuana State Licensing Authority
[02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:35.950]  or a local licensing authority?
[02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:36.790]  Yep.
[02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:38.430]  Then the next little-
[02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:39.830]  Cops don't get no badges.
[02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:42.350]  The next little note here says, stop.
[02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:45.070]  If you answered yes to any of the above questions
[02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:47.310]  by Colorado law, you cannot obtain or hold
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:50.910]  a Colorado marijuana occupational employee license.
[02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:52.190]  Yep, those are just straight up,
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:54.270]  you can't get a license, period.
[02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:56.910]  Don't try, we'll find it with the FBI background check.
[02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:58.590]  Yep, so if you heard, if you qualify
[02:12:58.590 --> 02:13:00.750]  under any of that shit that we just read,
[02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:04.430]  you cannot work in Colorado in the legal marijuana industry.
[02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:05.950]  You're gonna have to go to California,
[02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:08.750]  or Washington, or Oregon, or maybe Michigan,
[02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:09.790]  or who else is legal now?
[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:11.110]  Mike, where can people go?
[02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:16.470]  Other legal states, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, DC, sorta.
[02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:18.310]  Go up there with Charlotte, Maine, and Alaska.
[02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:21.270]  There's 23 medical marijuana states, get online,
[02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:22.710]  look at the laws in each one,
[02:13:22.710 --> 02:13:24.150]  see which ones you can still work for.
[02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:27.670]  Or, or, or, or, what you should really do,
[02:13:27.670 --> 02:13:28.510]  wherever you are-
[02:13:28.510 --> 02:13:29.710]  Change the laws in your area.
[02:13:29.710 --> 02:13:33.470]  Make the laws better, legalize cannabis where you are.
[02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:35.670]  If you can't work in the legal industry,
[02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:38.030]  that doesn't mean you can't lobby on its behalf.
[02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.870]  That's the truth.
[02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:40.550]  Shout out to Daryl if you listen to the podcast.
[02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:42.590]  I'm just gonna throw that out there.
[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:44.990]  Yeah, you can do what you can do for your area.
[02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:48.430]  Maybe you can't be a grower, maybe you can't be a manager,
[02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:49.350]  maybe you can't be an owner,
[02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:52.070]  but you can always be a lobbyist, you can be an activist,
[02:13:52.070 --> 02:13:54.190]  you can do your part in some way, shape, or form.
[02:13:54.190 --> 02:13:55.190]  That is for sure.
[02:13:55.190 --> 02:13:57.790]  So, after it asks you all these questions,
[02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:59.830]  and when you check no to them or yes to them,
[02:13:59.830 --> 02:14:00.910]  it makes you sign, and it says,
[02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:03.030]  I have thoroughly read and understand the questions above,
[02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:04.270]  and understand that I cannot hold
[02:14:04.270 --> 02:14:05.950]  a Colorado marijuana license.
[02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:09.230]  If at any time in the future I can ever answer yes,
[02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:11.390]  if at any time in the future I can ever answer yes
[02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:12.630]  to any of the questions above.
[02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:13.790]  That's weirdly worded.
[02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:16.790]  It's weird, but it's crazy legal talk
[02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:19.590]  for if the answer to this change is like,
[02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:22.670]  if you committed a felony nine years ago and two years passed,
[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:25.070]  and now that felony conviction and all your shit with it
[02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:28.910]  was over 10 years ago, like you're good to go now.
[02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:29.750]  All right.
[02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:32.430]  You can reapply or apply, period.
[02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:36.110]  So, then there's also an arrest disclosure forum.
[02:14:36.110 --> 02:14:36.950]  Forum.
[02:14:37.070 --> 02:14:39.110]  If it says, if since turning age 18,
[02:14:39.110 --> 02:14:41.150]  have you ever been arrested, served criminal summons,
[02:14:41.150 --> 02:14:43.070]  charged with, or convicted of any crime
[02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:44.470]  regarding the possession, distribution,
[02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:45.950]  or use of a controlled substance,
[02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:47.550]  you must disclose this information
[02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:49.550]  to the marijuana enforcement division.
[02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:50.390]  Yep.
[02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:51.430]  Make sure you get them all on there too,
[02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:53.870]  because oops, I forgot that one.
[02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:55.710]  Looks really fucking bad.
[02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:57.630]  They give you plenty of space to list.
[02:14:57.630 --> 02:14:58.470]  Yep.
[02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:59.790]  Holy crap.
[02:14:59.790 --> 02:15:02.030]  Check any of the following or professional licenses
[02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.870]  you have held.
[02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:05.030]  So, it asks which licenses you have held.
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:07.710]  So, it asks which licenses you've had.
[02:15:07.710 --> 02:15:09.230]  It asks if you've had a liquor license,
[02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:12.270]  or a lawyer license, or a racing license, a lottery license.
[02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.950]  So, it's going to ask you a lot of crazy questions.
[02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:16.430]  Fill all of this out truthfully, okay?
[02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:19.030]  So, read the disqualifying conditions.
[02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:21.990]  If you qualify, then print out the application.
[02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.870]  Don't fucking print it.
[02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:24.390]  It's like 10 pages of paper.
[02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:25.230]  Let's see.
[02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:26.070]  There's several pages here.
[02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:28.030]  Yeah, read through it.
[02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.870]  Yeah, it's 11 pages.
[02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:30.310]  Make sure you read the qualifications.
[02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:32.070]  The ones we read you verbatim
[02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:35.710]  are the automatic disqualification ones.
[02:15:35.710 --> 02:15:37.230]  If you start checking yes
[02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:39.390]  to some of the ones we're talking about now,
[02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:41.310]  that doesn't automatically mean a no.
[02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:43.310]  It means you got some explaining to do.
[02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:45.990]  No, those, okay, yeah, the first ones were nos.
[02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:47.750]  Yeah, the first ones are automatic nos.
[02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:50.350]  If it's a felony in 10 years,
[02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:51.670]  or a felony in five years,
[02:15:51.670 --> 02:15:53.310]  a drug-related felony in 10.
[02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:56.190]  If you're a cop,
[02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:58.750]  or I don't remember what the last one was,
[02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:59.750]  cop or doctor.
[02:15:59.750 --> 02:16:00.790]  Those all disqualify you right away.
[02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:02.630]  Those all DQ you automatically,
[02:16:02.630 --> 02:16:04.350]  but the only two of those that apply to most
[02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:06.910]  of the people listening to the show are the first two.
[02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:07.750]  All right, all right.
[02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:10.150]  You don't think any cops listen to the show?
[02:16:10.150 --> 02:16:11.990]  Well, maybe.
[02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:13.870]  I hope there are cops out there to listen.
[02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:15.510]  I really hope there are law enforcement officers
[02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:16.910]  listening to the show and becoming educated and aware.
[02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:18.070]  The more I think about it,
[02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:19.710]  there's probably a couple,
[02:16:19.710 --> 02:16:20.950]  a good number of listeners.
[02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:22.710]  There was an event that we did for the show.
[02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:23.830]  We did a live show somewhere.
[02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:25.390]  The place doesn't exist anymore,
[02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:26.590]  but we did a live show somewhere,
[02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:27.790]  and we invited people to come,
[02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:29.630]  and I made flyers for the show.
[02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:31.710]  And I put out flyers for the podcast
[02:16:31.710 --> 02:16:33.230]  to come listen to wild people.
[02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:34.790]  It was a smoking place.
[02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:37.030]  I remember because I used to sit in a room
[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:38.990]  with a number of members of law enforcement
[02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.150]  every Monday night.
[02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.990]  Okay, okay.
[02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:42.190]  So like when this happened,
[02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:44.870]  that I was keenly aware of how many officers
[02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:47.270]  were in that room every Monday night.
[02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:49.430]  I put out flyers to listen to the podcast
[02:16:49.430 --> 02:16:50.430]  at a smoking event,
[02:16:50.430 --> 02:16:52.470]  and somehow law enforcement found the flyers
[02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:54.510]  and thought that they were like some sort of tickets
[02:16:54.510 --> 02:16:57.190]  to get free weed at the event or something.
[02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:58.110]  And so on the next episode,
[02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:59.230]  I gave a shout out to the cops,
[02:16:59.870 --> 02:17:00.710]  hoping that they were listening
[02:17:00.710 --> 02:17:01.910]  because they had the flyers and it said how to listen.
[02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:02.870]  It had a little QR code.
[02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:03.710]  If you scanned it,
[02:17:03.710 --> 02:17:05.630]  it would take you to iTunes and you could hear the show.
[02:17:05.630 --> 02:17:06.950]  So if you're in law enforcement,
[02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:07.870]  I appreciate you for listening.
[02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:09.270]  I hope you're learning the truth about cannabis.
[02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:10.110]  It's not evil.
[02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.950]  It's not terrible.
[02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:11.790]  It doesn't ruin anybody.
[02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:12.630]  We're not that scary.
[02:17:12.630 --> 02:17:13.790]  We do understand that there are laws
[02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:14.670]  that you have to enforce,
[02:17:14.670 --> 02:17:17.110]  but we wish that you would do what you can to change laws
[02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:18.670]  because I'm sure you see that it's not a problem
[02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:19.550]  where you are, officer.
[02:17:19.550 --> 02:17:20.390]  Much respect for you.
[02:17:20.390 --> 02:17:21.350]  Thanks for doing what you do.
[02:17:21.350 --> 02:17:22.990]  All right, so print the application.
[02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.830]  That's the next step here.
[02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:24.870]  We're going to keep this show on track.
[02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:26.630]  Mike's got ADD today.
[02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:28.390]  Print the application, complete the application.
[02:17:28.390 --> 02:17:29.830]  That shouldn't be too hard.
[02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:31.310]  So at that point,
[02:17:31.310 --> 02:17:33.350]  obtain any court papers that you need,
[02:17:33.350 --> 02:17:36.350]  any arrest disclosure forms, anything like that.
[02:17:36.350 --> 02:17:38.230]  If you've got tax paper forms that you need,
[02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:41.310]  if you have child support paper forms that you need,
[02:17:41.310 --> 02:17:43.310]  print all that, find those papers.
[02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:47.030]  Then you need to make an appointment.
[02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:50.310]  The Denver office in Longmont accepts walk-ins.
[02:17:50.310 --> 02:17:52.190]  In Grand Junction, you need to make an appointment.
[02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:54.510]  In Springs, you need to make an appointment.
[02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.990]  The phone number is on the website.
[02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.990]  I guess I could have had that for you.
[02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.830]  I do not.
[02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:58.670]  I apologize.
[02:17:58.670 --> 02:17:59.510]  I failed you there.
[02:17:59.510 --> 02:18:01.550]  You're going to have to do a little bit of this on your own.
[02:18:01.550 --> 02:18:03.710]  So call and make an appointment.
[02:18:03.710 --> 02:18:07.150]  It's way easier to call and make an appointment in Springs
[02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:08.070]  than it is to sit there
[02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:10.150]  and wait for like three hours in Denver.
[02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:11.830]  That's what I did and it kind of sucked.
[02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:13.190]  You waited all day in Denver?
[02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:14.030]  Yep.
[02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:15.470]  I made my appointment for Colorado Springs.
[02:18:15.470 --> 02:18:17.550]  I showed up about 15 minutes early
[02:18:17.550 --> 02:18:19.190]  because I thought it would take much longer to get there.
[02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.390]  It's hard to judge I-25.
[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:21.950]  It could take you an hour or an hour and a half
[02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:23.030]  to get from here to there.
[02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:24.910]  So I got there about 15 minutes early
[02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:25.750]  and the lady was like,
[02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:29.150]  hey, the guy that was scheduled before you didn't show up.
[02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.990]  Are you ready?
[02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:31.190]  And I was like, well, fuck yeah, I'm ready.
[02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:33.270]  And it took her, I don't know,
[02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:34.870]  maybe an hour to do the entire process.
[02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:37.270]  She fingerprinted me, interviewed me.
[02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:38.630]  That's why you're waiting all day in Denver
[02:18:38.630 --> 02:18:40.030]  is because that's how long it takes.
[02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:40.870]  Right.
[02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:41.710]  And there's a lot of other people
[02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:44.070]  who just showed up every day in Denver.
[02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:45.590]  And just relax when they're fingerprinting you.
[02:18:45.590 --> 02:18:46.430]  It's easy.
[02:18:46.430 --> 02:18:47.270]  And you know what?
[02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:48.270]  If you've got warrants or something,
[02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:50.270]  if you're wanted in the state of Colorado
[02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:52.830]  and you're in the MED office getting your shit done,
[02:18:53.590 --> 02:18:55.030]  they run your ID and if you're wanted,
[02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:56.590]  they come and fucking arrest you.
[02:18:56.590 --> 02:18:58.070]  Yeah, we really can't emphasize,
[02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:59.550]  like read the questions.
[02:18:59.550 --> 02:19:01.830]  And if the answer's yes to the first four,
[02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:05.870]  or you've got like active warrants out now, don't apply.
[02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:06.710]  Don't apply.
[02:19:06.710 --> 02:19:07.670]  Cause I'm not even kidding.
[02:19:07.670 --> 02:19:08.670]  They will come arrest you.
[02:19:08.670 --> 02:19:10.470]  If you're getting fingerprinted and they run your shit
[02:19:10.470 --> 02:19:12.030]  and you're wanted by the FBI,
[02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:14.030]  there's a sign on the door that says unmarked
[02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:17.990]  or plainclothes security officer on premises at all times.
[02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:19.150]  He will come and arrest you.
[02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:21.630]  Yeah, I spent three and a half hours trying to find the dude.
[02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:23.270]  And I think I found both of them.
[02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:27.270]  Like they're not playing around.
[02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:29.190]  Read the questions, answer them honestly.
[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:31.750]  For the secondary questions,
[02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:35.230]  like child support and student loans,
[02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:37.350]  if you've got any of those,
[02:19:37.350 --> 02:19:38.910]  you know, any of those questions apply to you,
[02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:41.830]  you're gonna need to contact that institution.
[02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:45.710]  Like I had to contact everybody I've got student loans with
[02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:47.670]  and get a paper that says my student loans
[02:19:47.670 --> 02:19:48.510]  are in good standing.
[02:19:48.510 --> 02:19:50.590]  Which means if you've been ducking that shit for a decade,
[02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:52.990]  you need to stand up, take the punch,
[02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:55.070]  set up a payment plan, start making payments.
[02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:56.390]  You only need to make one payment.
[02:19:56.390 --> 02:19:58.070]  Same thing with child support.
[02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:59.990]  Right, if your child support is fucked up,
[02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:01.230]  I was cool cause mine's legit,
[02:20:01.230 --> 02:20:02.350]  but if your child support is fucked up,
[02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:04.350]  they will make you get a paper from your caseworker
[02:20:04.350 --> 02:20:05.390]  that says that you're paying
[02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:06.750]  and that you're doing what you can.
[02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:11.750]  If you had felonies 17 years ago or over the deadline
[02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:13.550]  and you're good to go,
[02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:15.670]  you need paperwork from the court
[02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:18.750]  that adjudicated your felony in the original jurisdiction.
[02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:20.110]  You gotta fucking contact the court
[02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:21.830]  that tried and sentenced you
[02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:23.470]  and get the paperwork from them
[02:20:23.470 --> 02:20:25.190]  that says you completed successfully
[02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:28.990]  and on what date you completed for every fucking felony.
[02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:30.230]  And it can be a real pain.
[02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:33.030]  You've got, I mean, I've talked to people in Denver
[02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:34.950]  while I was waiting that had to go to like
[02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:37.670]  seven different courthouses to pick up stuff
[02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:40.910]  that they got between 20 or like 18 and 20.
[02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:43.110]  And then they've been perfect for a decade,
[02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:45.270]  but they had still had to spend four days
[02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:47.950]  driving between courthouses getting paperwork
[02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:49.670]  so that they could then apply to work
[02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.150]  in the legal marijuana industry.
[02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:53.310]  Like have your shit together.
[02:20:53.310 --> 02:20:54.790]  And for some of you,
[02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:56.950]  that's gonna be a lot of paperwork gathering.
[02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:58.070]  If you don't have it together,
[02:20:58.070 --> 02:21:00.030]  the lady at the MED office or the man,
[02:21:00.030 --> 02:21:01.150]  the person that helped me was a lady.
[02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:01.990]  So I always think it's a lady,
[02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:04.430]  but the person that helps you at the MED office,
[02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:07.070]  they will give you a list of everything that you need
[02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:08.510]  after you fail the first time.
[02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:10.390]  Yeah, that's the first step of the process
[02:21:10.390 --> 02:21:11.870]  when you get there and it's your turn
[02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:15.150]  is they go through your shit piece by piece
[02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:16.830]  and make sure you have everything.
[02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:19.510]  And when I got done,
[02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:21.790]  it was very clearly like you have everything.
[02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:23.790]  It's your first try, wow, high five.
[02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:24.630]  That's kind of, yeah.
[02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:25.550]  Yeah, well I was well prepared.
[02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:27.870]  I knew plenty of people that have badges.
[02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:29.150]  I was the same way.
[02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:31.590]  Yeah, so neither of us had an issue,
[02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:33.430]  but we've all talked to countless people
[02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:36.030]  that have no idea what this process looks like.
[02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:37.510]  They even moved to Colorado,
[02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:39.790]  moved across the country unprepared.
[02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:41.750]  And so knowing this and doing it right
[02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:43.110]  is sort of essential folks.
[02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:44.550]  If you've got 44 felonies,
[02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:45.670]  you're probably not gonna get that much.
[02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:47.350]  I've been thinking about it this whole show.
[02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:48.670]  Shout out to our buddy 44.
[02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:49.510]  Shout out, buddy.
[02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:51.190]  Nobody's ever known why we call him 44
[02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:52.910]  and that's the only hint we're gonna give you.
[02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:54.750]  So we're gonna keep moving.
[02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:56.830]  When you show up, okay, the next step is show up
[02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:58.870]  and complete the damn interview.
[02:21:58.870 --> 02:22:00.030]  It's an MEP interview.
[02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:01.870]  It doesn't matter what you wear or anything.
[02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:03.830]  Comb your hair if you do that.
[02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:05.510]  If you got dreadlocks, flatten them down
[02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:06.350]  because they're gonna make you take off your hat
[02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:07.190]  and they're gonna make you take a picture.
[02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:08.350]  They're gonna make you take your hat off
[02:22:08.350 --> 02:22:10.150]  and then you're gonna wear the picture they take
[02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:12.070]  around your neck for the next two years.
[02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:13.990]  Bro, I'm 6'5".
[02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:16.310]  And that picture place, they have like a little,
[02:22:16.310 --> 02:22:19.630]  like a swatch on the floor or on the wall of material
[02:22:19.630 --> 02:22:20.830]  where you're supposed to stand in front of.
[02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:23.550]  That shit's like 5'10", like where most people are.
[02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:25.110]  So I gotta do a squat.
[02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:26.390]  So I'm trying to smile as I'm doing the squats.
[02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:28.310]  I had to squat but not real far.
[02:22:28.310 --> 02:22:29.350]  Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[02:22:29.350 --> 02:22:30.910]  All right, so when you show up for the place,
[02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:32.830]  when you show up for the interview,
[02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:34.110]  bring the completed application.
[02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:36.110]  Have that shit filled out before you get there.
[02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:37.270]  Bring your ID.
[02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:39.110]  Bring your court papers and disclosure forms
[02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:41.710]  if you've got any of those to bring with you.
[02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:44.310]  Bring proof of residency if you don't have,
[02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:46.350]  if you're new to Colorado and your ID,
[02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:47.790]  if you do have an out of state ID,
[02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:48.750]  that's what the fuck I'm trying to say.
[02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:50.310]  If your ID is from out of state,
[02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:52.230]  bring proof of residency that you do live
[02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:53.110]  in the state of Colorado.
[02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:56.110]  Bring a phone bill, bring a fucking cable bill,
[02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:57.870]  bring the light bill, bring whatever you got that shows up.
[02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:59.510]  This goes back to column.
[02:22:59.510 --> 02:23:01.310]  They'll tell you exactly what you need
[02:23:01.310 --> 02:23:04.070]  and this is the time to bring up my ID
[02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:07.710]  says I'm from Texas or Tennessee or wherever the fuck.
[02:23:07.710 --> 02:23:10.430]  Like bring it up and they'll tell you exactly
[02:23:10.430 --> 02:23:12.510]  what you need supporting paperwork wise.
[02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:13.470]  If you've got felonies,
[02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:16.870]  they'll tell you what to ask the courts for.
[02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:18.510]  Same thing with your child support stuff.
[02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:20.430]  They told me exactly what the letter had to say.
[02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:22.190]  It's all on the application when you look at it.
[02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:24.270]  And they're happy to answer these questions.
[02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:27.150]  Super important, they do not take cash.
[02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:29.110]  Bring a money order or bring a check.
[02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:31.230]  If you're going to get your key badge
[02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:32.670]  and this is where we'll talk about this part.
[02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.110]  If you're going to get your key badge,
[02:23:34.110 --> 02:23:36.510]  it's gonna cost you $300.
[02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:39.270]  If you want your support badge, it is $150.
[02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:40.390]  Mike looked at me, is that wrong dude?
[02:23:40.390 --> 02:23:41.230]  Cause I just looked at the website.
[02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:44.150]  No, the prices were right, but I think Denver takes cash.
[02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.990]  I'm like 85% sure I'm getting cash.
[02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:47.110]  You know, I said that to somebody else
[02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:48.510]  that was helping me with this episode.
[02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:49.350]  Shout out to Jessica.
[02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:50.190]  That might've changed, that would be something
[02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:51.030]  you'd wanna ask on the phone.
[02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:52.110]  And she's like, they will not accept cash.
[02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:54.350]  And the website says bring check or money order.
[02:23:54.350 --> 02:23:56.430]  So I'm pretty sure they quit accepting cash.
[02:23:56.430 --> 02:23:57.270]  Just imagine.
[02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:58.110]  That wouldn't surprise me.
[02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:59.870]  I knew that only one office did
[02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:01.030]  and I could have sworn it was Denver,
[02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:02.230]  but I might've taken a check.
[02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:05.310]  I worked at a place that had a lot of cash flow.
[02:24:05.310 --> 02:24:07.630]  Like we had a lot of cash in the end of the register.
[02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:09.510]  They've worked at several places.
[02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:12.910]  And just imagine how many applications they handle a day.
[02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:17.910]  $150 a badge, minimum time, 16,000 employees.
[02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:19.510]  Imagine all of them.
[02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:22.030]  Divided by 365 days, people you can do the math.
[02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:24.230]  You just don't want that much money in a box
[02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:25.910]  in the NED office anywhere.
[02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:27.870]  Like over a fucking couple of days,
[02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:29.150]  that box is gonna be full of cash.
[02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:31.430]  So I understand they probably, just be prepared.
[02:24:31.430 --> 02:24:33.630]  You guys take a check or take a money order.
[02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:35.390]  Just stop it somewhere that sells a money order.
[02:24:35.390 --> 02:24:36.850]  Freaking Walmart sucks.
[02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:37.690]  They have money orders.
[02:24:37.690 --> 02:24:39.690]  I think most Walgreens will sell you a money order.
[02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:40.930]  Several 7-Elevens will.
[02:24:40.930 --> 02:24:41.850]  7-Eleven will do it.
[02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:43.290]  You can go to the post office.
[02:24:43.290 --> 02:24:44.650]  Get yourself a money order.
[02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:46.250]  Go to the MED place.
[02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:47.290]  Now let's talk about the difference
[02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:49.810]  between a key badge and a support badge.
[02:24:49.810 --> 02:24:52.670]  There always has to be a support badge on premises.
[02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:55.610]  Nobody can be in my grow without a support badge.
[02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:57.650]  There either has to be a red badge, which is the owner badge.
[02:24:57.650 --> 02:24:59.210]  You have to own the place to get that one.
[02:24:59.210 --> 02:25:00.090]  Or a key badge.
[02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:02.130]  If you don't have a key badge,
[02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:03.530]  if there's not a key badge on premises,
[02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:04.850]  nobody else can be in there.
[02:25:04.850 --> 02:25:07.010]  None of the support badges can be in the room.
[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:11.810]  So I find it advantageous to go ahead and get that key badge
[02:25:11.810 --> 02:25:14.050]  because then you're kind of more qualified to do more shit.
[02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:15.710]  You've already got more ability
[02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:18.090]  to take on more responsibility.
[02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:19.730]  I made sure to get the key.
[02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:20.930]  Yeah, and did it help you?
[02:25:20.930 --> 02:25:23.050]  Do you feel like getting your key badge
[02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:25.730]  helped you advance in your position at the spot?
[02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:27.930]  I think those rules are more heavily enforced
[02:25:27.930 --> 02:25:29.810]  on the medical side.
[02:25:29.810 --> 02:25:30.730]  Okay.
[02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:34.450]  Or maybe I'm just, no, I've gotta be the,
[02:25:35.090 --> 02:25:36.970]  I'm the only support badge server that's a week at work.
[02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:37.810]  The only key badge.
[02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:38.930]  That might be why, or my only key badge,
[02:25:38.930 --> 02:25:40.250]  that might be why I got promoted.
[02:25:40.250 --> 02:25:41.090]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:42.290]  At one of my promotions.
[02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:43.970]  Yeah, it just makes you more promotable.
[02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:47.330]  So a support badge, you can be like a bud tender.
[02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:48.170]  You can be a trimmer.
[02:25:48.170 --> 02:25:49.890]  You can be a joint roller.
[02:25:49.890 --> 02:25:51.530]  You can, in the gardens, you can-
[02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:53.170]  Support badge is the starter badge.
[02:25:53.170 --> 02:25:55.530]  Like if you've only got 150 to spend on a badge
[02:25:55.530 --> 02:25:57.770]  and you know you're gonna be a trimmer for the first year.
[02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:58.890]  Or a bud tender.
[02:25:58.890 --> 02:25:59.730]  Or a bud tender.
[02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:00.970]  You can go ahead and get the support.
[02:26:00.970 --> 02:26:02.090]  Like we're not saying don't,
[02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:04.250]  but the key badge definitely gives you
[02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:06.050]  more opportunities in the industry.
[02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:08.490]  And if you're one of those people that's moving
[02:26:08.490 --> 02:26:11.510]  to Colorado with a degree in biochemistry,
[02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:16.170]  like you might wanna go ahead and get the support badge.
[02:26:16.170 --> 02:26:17.210]  Or the key badge, I'm sorry.
[02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:18.890]  I'm mixing those two in my head.
[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:21.090]  I was trying to figure, you confused me.
[02:26:21.090 --> 02:26:21.930]  So that's all right.
[02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:22.770]  Sorry.
[02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:24.130]  Yeah, the key badge is the more important one.
[02:26:24.130 --> 02:26:25.770]  I was looking for the distinguishing,
[02:26:25.770 --> 02:26:27.210]  it says something about on the application.
[02:26:27.210 --> 02:26:30.050]  If you're going to have keys and be in charge of employees
[02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:31.930]  and have access to limited access areas,
[02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:34.010]  you should go ahead and get a key badge.
[02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:35.570]  So I recommend of course get the key badge.
[02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:36.570]  If you don't have the money for it,
[02:26:36.570 --> 02:26:38.110]  get yourself a support badge.
[02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:40.050]  If you're an ambitious person
[02:26:40.050 --> 02:26:41.170]  and you feel like you wanna move up
[02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:42.610]  if you're gonna manage that bitch.
[02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:43.450]  Get the key.
[02:26:43.450 --> 02:26:44.410]  Go ahead and get a key badge.
[02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:45.690]  If you wanna work with the grow team,
[02:26:45.690 --> 02:26:47.450]  if you're real enthusiastic and you can show
[02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:49.410]  that you can do it, get yourself a key badge.
[02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:51.810]  We'd love to see you move up in the industry super quickly.
[02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:54.410]  I knew I wasn't gonna be on the bottom rung for long,
[02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:56.170]  so I fully got that one on purpose.
[02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:59.010]  Like I know a lot of other people that did that too.
[02:26:59.010 --> 02:27:00.850]  And I know a couple of people who got the support
[02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:03.730]  and have been kind of passed over several times
[02:27:03.730 --> 02:27:06.090]  because they can't meet some of those requirements
[02:27:06.090 --> 02:27:07.250]  that you have to have the key for.
[02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:10.170]  Gotta have a key badge on premises at all times.
[02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:12.370]  Gotta be pretty much in the same room
[02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:13.890]  with the support badges.
[02:27:13.890 --> 02:27:15.730]  You can't even leave them in another room.
[02:27:15.730 --> 02:27:16.950]  So, all right.
[02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:19.550]  So if you wanna be like the cultivation manager,
[02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:20.390]  get a key badge.
[02:27:20.390 --> 02:27:22.290]  If you wanna be a trim team leader, get a key badge.
[02:27:22.290 --> 02:27:24.370]  Maybe even if you wanna be lead bud tender,
[02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:25.330]  you might need a key badge
[02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:28.370]  because you'll be carrying product back to the storage room,
[02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:30.330]  which requires a key badge to get into,
[02:27:30.330 --> 02:27:32.170]  or at least it should.
[02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:33.450]  So, get your badge.
[02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:34.370]  It's gonna cost money.
[02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:35.450]  Decide which badge you want.
[02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:36.650]  The next step here, you guys,
[02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:39.130]  once you've got your badge, wait for it, take a picture.
[02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:40.410]  Fucking smile for your picture.
[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:41.330]  Look good in the picture, bro.
[02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:42.170]  That's the next step.
[02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:43.970]  Yep, you don't wanna look like a dumb ass
[02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:45.490]  and then hang that picture around your neck
[02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:46.570]  for the next two years.
[02:27:46.570 --> 02:27:48.290]  Wear that bright green Colorado
[02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:50.650]  medical marijuana enforcement division lanyard.
[02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:53.010]  With your cheesy ass picture on it.
[02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:54.370]  Oh, it's so funny walking into places.
[02:27:54.370 --> 02:27:55.730]  Do you still have your original lanyard?
[02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:57.290]  I got the original green one, bro.
[02:27:57.290 --> 02:27:59.210]  Yeah, yeah. Way to be OG, buddy.
[02:27:59.210 --> 02:28:00.170]  I'm OG.
[02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:02.330]  All right, so once you've got that picture
[02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:03.730]  with your cheesy ass grin on it,
[02:28:03.730 --> 02:28:05.490]  you got a badge,
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:07.290]  the next step is to get a job.
[02:28:08.730 --> 02:28:09.730]  Once you get the badge,
[02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:11.450]  now you can apply in the industry.
[02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:12.290]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:14.130]  So, think about what you're good at.
[02:28:14.130 --> 02:28:15.290]  Are you good at bud tending?
[02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:16.210]  Are you good at trimming?
[02:28:16.210 --> 02:28:17.850]  Honestly, we keep saying bud tending and trimming.
[02:28:17.850 --> 02:28:20.290]  Those are the ways into this industry.
[02:28:20.290 --> 02:28:21.530]  If you wanna be a master grower,
[02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:23.210]  most places have a master grower.
[02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:24.210]  You're gonna have to start trimming.
[02:28:24.210 --> 02:28:26.010]  You're gonna have to show them that you know about plants.
[02:28:26.010 --> 02:28:27.690]  One day the master grower is gonna go,
[02:28:27.690 --> 02:28:29.690]  fuck, I need help transplanting plants.
[02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:31.050]  And you're gonna go, I'm good at that.
[02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:32.890]  And he's gonna go, well, come show me what you got.
[02:28:32.890 --> 02:28:34.130]  And if you can follow directions
[02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:35.930]  and do it the way that he wants it done,
[02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:39.290]  and also contribute skill, knowledge, and care to the job,
[02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:41.570]  you may end up being assistant grower one day.
[02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:44.010]  I may let you come help me pull leaves in the garden one day.
[02:28:44.010 --> 02:28:45.250]  You'll work your way up.
[02:28:45.250 --> 02:28:46.570]  And one day when I'm,
[02:28:46.570 --> 02:28:48.170]  or not me, I don't wanna say it about me,
[02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:50.250]  when the master grower at whatever facility you work at,
[02:28:50.250 --> 02:28:51.450]  one day when he's sick or whatever,
[02:28:51.450 --> 02:28:53.050]  and he's got the shits and can't come in,
[02:28:53.050 --> 02:28:54.850]  maybe you get to water the plants or whatever,
[02:28:54.850 --> 02:28:56.290]  and you get to learn how to become a master grower.
[02:28:56.290 --> 02:28:58.930]  You're gonna work your way up one way or another.
[02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.530]  Jeff and I were both bud tenders.
[02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:04.210]  That's where you start.
[02:29:05.250 --> 02:29:06.970]  A lot of people start off as trimmers.
[02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:07.970]  That's where you start.
[02:29:07.970 --> 02:29:10.570]  You can be almost anything in the marijuana industry.
[02:29:10.570 --> 02:29:12.570]  We literally need every profession.
[02:29:12.570 --> 02:29:16.090]  I have played bud tender, manager,
[02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:18.770]  hire and firer.
[02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:20.290]  I did the hiring and firing.
[02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:22.290]  I grew the weed.
[02:29:22.290 --> 02:29:24.130]  I'm still doing the growing.
[02:29:24.130 --> 02:29:27.490]  I do some transportation.
[02:29:27.490 --> 02:29:29.250]  Do a bunch of, do all of the,
[02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:30.650]  I used to do, yeah.
[02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:32.090]  You've helped with design at different points.
[02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:33.890]  I've designed a couple of facilities.
[02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:34.890]  I've designed rooms.
[02:29:34.890 --> 02:29:36.810]  Yeah, I've done a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:37.650]  So there are a lot of options available.
[02:29:37.650 --> 02:29:39.610]  But it starts off at the bottom.
[02:29:39.610 --> 02:29:40.810]  I talk to people every day
[02:29:40.810 --> 02:29:42.930]  that aren't prepared for that idea.
[02:29:42.930 --> 02:29:45.410]  They're like, well, I've been in marketing for 10 years,
[02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:46.770]  and it's like, cool.
[02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:48.370]  Are you ready to trim some weed?
[02:29:48.370 --> 02:29:49.210]  Yeah.
[02:29:49.210 --> 02:29:52.450]  Like, do you think you could learn everything in this room
[02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:54.050]  and what their different applications are
[02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:55.130]  for different patients,
[02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:58.970]  and sell it accurately and well-informed?
[02:29:59.010 --> 02:30:00.010]  Can you pull that off?
[02:30:00.010 --> 02:30:01.090]  Because if you can't do that
[02:30:01.090 --> 02:30:03.370]  or be cool with trimming a shill of the weed,
[02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:05.090]  like, you're gonna have a really hard time
[02:30:05.090 --> 02:30:07.210]  looking for a dispensary
[02:30:07.210 --> 02:30:09.490]  that's actively looking for a marketing dude
[02:30:09.490 --> 02:30:11.770]  who's never worked in legal weed before,
[02:30:11.770 --> 02:30:14.210]  and doesn't necessarily know the community,
[02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:17.010]  the culture, the product, the clients.
[02:30:17.010 --> 02:30:18.690]  Like, there's a lot you need to know,
[02:30:18.690 --> 02:30:20.370]  and you learn that when you start
[02:30:20.370 --> 02:30:21.650]  as a blood tender or a trimmer.
[02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:22.730]  It's a whole etiquette.
[02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:24.690]  It's a whole world to be involved in.
[02:30:24.690 --> 02:30:26.490]  A buddy of mine started as a trimmer,
[02:30:26.490 --> 02:30:27.930]  and like six weeks later,
[02:30:27.930 --> 02:30:29.370]  he was running a trim crew
[02:30:29.370 --> 02:30:30.930]  for like seven different dispensaries,
[02:30:30.930 --> 02:30:33.930]  and they just cycled between them as they harvested.
[02:30:33.930 --> 02:30:34.970]  Shout out to Linus.
[02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:35.810]  Yep.
[02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:36.650]  Shout out Linus.
[02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:39.130]  Like, he struggled for a while
[02:30:39.130 --> 02:30:41.250]  finding a dispensary that would even take him on
[02:30:41.250 --> 02:30:42.650]  as a trimmer.
[02:30:42.650 --> 02:30:44.370]  And when he finally found one,
[02:30:44.370 --> 02:30:46.730]  he made sure to put it in his all,
[02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:49.970]  and now he's running a big-ass crew.
[02:30:49.970 --> 02:30:50.810]  A big crew.
[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:51.850]  I see what he's doing on Facebook,
[02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:52.690]  and he's killing it.
[02:30:52.690 --> 02:30:53.530]  His crew is killing it.
[02:30:53.530 --> 02:30:54.370]  Yep, they're killing it right now.
[02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:55.810]  They're doing a great job.
[02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:56.650]  I'm the same way.
[02:30:56.650 --> 02:30:57.490]  You're the same way.
[02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.850]  I wish we moved up quick.
[02:30:58.850 --> 02:31:00.890]  Be motivated if you wanna come here and work.
[02:31:00.890 --> 02:31:03.610]  This industry is growing so rapidly.
[02:31:03.610 --> 02:31:04.850]  We're growing so rapidly,
[02:31:04.850 --> 02:31:06.890]  and there are so many people coming from around the world
[02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:08.290]  to be in this industry,
[02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:11.690]  that there are 50 people trying to take your job
[02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:14.450]  in this industry every fucking day.
[02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:16.290]  Green and Healthy Wellness is a small shop
[02:31:16.290 --> 02:31:18.570]  with a small location.
[02:31:18.570 --> 02:31:19.890]  We aren't very well-known yet.
[02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.730]  We're kinda new.
[02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:21.570]  We don't have a large following.
[02:31:21.570 --> 02:31:22.890]  I think that's what I'm trying to say
[02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:23.730]  with a whole bunch of words.
[02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:25.250]  We don't have a huge following,
[02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:28.330]  but we get probably five to 10 applications
[02:31:28.330 --> 02:31:30.810]  every single day of people that wanna be growers,
[02:31:30.810 --> 02:31:33.770]  trimmers, bud tenders, whatever they can do.
[02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:34.970]  I will clean the toilets
[02:31:34.970 --> 02:31:37.370]  as long as you give me a job in there.
[02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:38.370]  I see some crazy.
[02:31:38.370 --> 02:31:41.290]  I see a lot of people coming in that are doing it right,
[02:31:41.290 --> 02:31:42.370]  that are ready to work,
[02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:43.850]  that know the industry
[02:31:43.850 --> 02:31:47.170]  and know how to sell their place in it.
[02:31:48.570 --> 02:31:50.210]  And a lot of it comes down to knowing
[02:31:50.210 --> 02:31:52.210]  how to pitch your previous work experience
[02:31:52.210 --> 02:31:54.570]  because I sold weed from my living room
[02:31:54.610 --> 02:31:56.290]  for the last 10 years.
[02:31:56.290 --> 02:31:57.730]  Looks like shit on a resume.
[02:31:57.730 --> 02:31:58.570]  Yeah, it does.
[02:31:59.450 --> 02:32:00.290]  Well, speaking of that-
[02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:03.010]  You did an episode before that covered
[02:32:03.010 --> 02:32:05.610]  some of the resumes you got in the grow
[02:32:05.610 --> 02:32:07.810]  and how ridiculous some of them could get.
[02:32:07.810 --> 02:32:10.050]  Put together a real resume.
[02:32:10.050 --> 02:32:11.850]  If you don't know what that is, Google it.
[02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:12.690]  Yeah.
[02:32:13.570 --> 02:32:15.530]  Be prepared because there's a lot of people
[02:32:15.530 --> 02:32:18.250]  gone in for the jobs that are available
[02:32:18.250 --> 02:32:20.370]  even with this, how fast we're expanding.
[02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:23.450]  So if you wanna stand out at all, you gotta do it right.
[02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:26.170]  Now let's talk about some of the problems
[02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:29.850]  that come with getting a job working in the cannabis industry.
[02:32:29.850 --> 02:32:33.930]  The number one most obvious problem to me is banking.
[02:32:33.930 --> 02:32:36.010]  Yep, that's an issue.
[02:32:36.010 --> 02:32:39.290]  When you worked at a dispensary or as a grower,
[02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:41.850]  and I can't speak for every shop or every grow,
[02:32:41.850 --> 02:32:43.130]  and this is something that I probably
[02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:44.250]  shouldn't say too much about,
[02:32:44.250 --> 02:32:46.010]  but this is the damn truth.
[02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:51.010]  When payday comes, you get an envelope stuffed with cash.
[02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:53.850]  Everything is done in cash, it sucks.
[02:32:53.850 --> 02:32:56.130]  Yeah, you get a pay stub and taxes are taken out
[02:32:56.130 --> 02:32:56.970]  and that you get a pay stub showing-
[02:32:56.970 --> 02:32:58.410]  Everything else is the same,
[02:32:58.410 --> 02:33:00.090]  but instead of a check at the bottom
[02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:03.610]  or better yet, a voided check that tells you
[02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:06.050]  about the direct deposit you just got,
[02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:08.650]  you get a check stub folded up
[02:33:08.650 --> 02:33:10.410]  with a bunch of 20s in the middle.
[02:33:10.410 --> 02:33:11.250]  A bunch of 20s in the middle.
[02:33:11.250 --> 02:33:12.090]  It's awkward as fuck.
[02:33:12.090 --> 02:33:13.890]  Yeah, you gotta carry all these damn 20s
[02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:16.250]  in your backpack or somehow to the car and then home.
[02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:18.770]  But it's not just payroll, it's everything.
[02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:22.890]  State taxes, federal taxes, electric bills, rent.
[02:33:24.090 --> 02:33:24.930]  It's fucking nuts.
[02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:26.330]  Yeah, so when you get home, you gotta figure out a way
[02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:29.290]  to convert all that cash into some way to pay your rent.
[02:33:29.290 --> 02:33:31.330]  So that is the obvious problem.
[02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:34.810]  Luckily, employees can usually get bank accounts.
[02:33:34.810 --> 02:33:36.650]  It's smaller banks, no problem.
[02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:39.050]  It's the businesses that really can't get accounts,
[02:33:39.050 --> 02:33:41.370]  but you've still gotta transfer cash to bank.
[02:33:41.370 --> 02:33:44.890]  Right, right, and that cash came from a dispensary.
[02:33:44.890 --> 02:33:46.570]  So sometimes it stinks like weed,
[02:33:46.570 --> 02:33:48.750]  which can trigger your account to get closed.
[02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:50.550]  Yep, yep.
[02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:51.510]  If your money stinks too much.
[02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:54.030]  We have a mutual friend whose account was just closed
[02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:55.990]  because their cash deposit smelled
[02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:57.630]  way too much like cannabis.
[02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:58.590]  Shout out to that person.
[02:33:58.590 --> 02:34:00.470]  Get a second safe, y'all.
[02:34:00.470 --> 02:34:02.230]  Yeah, also one of the problems,
[02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:04.150]  we've talked about this a little bit on the podcast.
[02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:05.270]  Another problem that can happen
[02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:07.030]  if you work in the cannabis industry
[02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.990]  is you're gonna get pulled over
[02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:10.030]  and you're gonna smell like a pound of fucking weed
[02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:12.070]  and the cops are gonna harass you.
[02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:14.350]  If you've got a badge, a lot of times they expect you
[02:34:14.350 --> 02:34:16.470]  to be a model citizen because you've got the badge
[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:17.550]  and you know the rules.
[02:34:17.550 --> 02:34:18.910]  So you've gotta be a little more careful.
[02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:21.150]  We're back to putting your best foot forward.
[02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:25.590]  Don't stink like weed with your badge on.
[02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:26.590]  And also-
[02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:29.230]  Because as soon as they see that fucker
[02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:31.190]  or even the green lanyard that goes with it,
[02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:33.590]  they're automatically gonna be thinking,
[02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:36.310]  is this person high right now behind the wheel?
[02:34:36.310 --> 02:34:37.590]  Do I have a DUI arrest?
[02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:39.710]  So don't be that person.
[02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:41.710]  True, also renting is hard.
[02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:43.430]  Yeah.
[02:34:43.430 --> 02:34:45.350]  Getting a house is hard when your place of employment
[02:34:45.350 --> 02:34:47.030]  is green and healthy wellness.
[02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:49.830]  There's a stigma involved that a lot of people
[02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:50.670]  don't realize.
[02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:52.830]  I've got a friend leaving the industry right now
[02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:58.790]  and they were talking to me just this afternoon
[02:34:58.790 --> 02:35:00.790]  that they're applying for jobs
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:03.030]  that aren't in the cannabis industry
[02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:07.270]  and he's real hesitant because he hasn't faced a company
[02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:09.070]  that drug tests in a decade.
[02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:13.150]  He's a bud tender and a cannabis consumer
[02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:16.070]  and passionate about cannabis,
[02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:18.750]  really enjoys that aspect of his life.
[02:35:18.750 --> 02:35:21.150]  And at minimum, he's gonna have to give it up
[02:35:21.150 --> 02:35:23.190]  until he can pee clean.
[02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:25.470]  And he wasn't necessarily expecting
[02:35:25.470 --> 02:35:26.950]  to leave the industry this abruptly,
[02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:29.310]  so he's not prepared for that.
[02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:33.550]  And so at best, his ass is gonna be out of work for a while
[02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:38.550]  while he looks for either jobs that don't test or whatnot,
[02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:41.350]  but he's extra hesitant because as soon as they're like,
[02:35:41.390 --> 02:35:43.550]  well, what'd you just get stopped doing?
[02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:45.910]  And he's like, well, I've worked in the marijuana industry
[02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:48.750]  for three years and now I'm trying to get a job at a bank
[02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:52.150]  or wherever the hell else, the mall.
[02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:54.550]  Yeah, they're gonna be judgmental for sure.
[02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:57.350]  Right, so even if they don't typically drug test
[02:35:57.350 --> 02:35:58.630]  or there's a lot of companies,
[02:35:58.630 --> 02:36:00.310]  I've worked for a bunch of them back in the day
[02:36:00.310 --> 02:36:01.790]  that just threatened to drug test
[02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:04.630]  and the only drug test they do is whether or not
[02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:06.030]  you show up to get your cup.
[02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:09.750]  They can't actually afford to pay the 75 bucks
[02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:10.950]  or whatever to test you.
[02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:12.470]  Yeah.
[02:36:12.470 --> 02:36:15.030]  Even those companies are more apt to test somebody
[02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:17.230]  who's coming out of the legal weed industry.
[02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:20.070]  It's just got that stigma attached to it.
[02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:24.110]  So renting, banking, renting cars, getting loans.
[02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:25.910]  Renting a car is kind of a bitch.
[02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:27.670]  I was turned down, I just bought a new car.
[02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:30.070]  You guys, woohoo, shout out to my new car.
[02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:31.310]  But also shout out to Mario Orch,
[02:36:31.310 --> 02:36:33.150]  a letter for the sweet hookup on the new car.
[02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:33.990]  But I got a new car.
[02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:35.230]  Shout out for not having to fix your old car.
[02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:36.430]  Yeah, I did that also.
[02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:37.270]  I got two cars.
[02:36:37.390 --> 02:36:38.230]  Yeah.
[02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:40.430]  Got a winter car and a summer car now.
[02:36:40.430 --> 02:36:41.270]  Nice.
[02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:42.910]  But I was declined.
[02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:45.550]  I've been getting stacks of envelopes in the mail
[02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:47.950]  from credit companies that declined my credit.
[02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:51.030]  And when you look at why, it says insufficient employment.
[02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:53.350]  And I make a shit ton of money, not to brag about my money,
[02:36:53.350 --> 02:36:56.470]  but I make plenty of fucking money for the car that I bought
[02:36:56.470 --> 02:36:57.510]  and they just didn't like it
[02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:58.590]  that I worked at a dispensary.
[02:36:58.590 --> 02:37:00.550]  They would call me while I was waiting
[02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:02.430]  in the Ford dealership to buy my car.
[02:37:02.430 --> 02:37:03.750]  They would call and they'd be like,
[02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:05.470]  hey, we've just got one question about your employment.
[02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:07.950]  What is this GAHW you work at?
[02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:09.150]  Because I just write down GAHW,
[02:37:09.150 --> 02:37:10.590]  trying to avoid questions.
[02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:12.630]  I was like, oh, it stands for green and healthy wellness.
[02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:14.470]  They're like, oh, are you a weed grower?
[02:37:14.470 --> 02:37:16.510]  They're like, well, yeah, bitch, why?
[02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:17.830]  Oh, we can't, we, sorry, we can't,
[02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:18.830]  we can't give you credit today.
[02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:19.670]  And they just hang up.
[02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:21.190]  Like, damn it, God damn it.
[02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:23.350]  It's not all companies, but it's several.
[02:37:23.350 --> 02:37:24.710]  Yeah.
[02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:27.390]  Shout out to the companies that don't apply to this,
[02:37:27.390 --> 02:37:30.030]  but like there's a stigma that you're going to take on
[02:37:30.030 --> 02:37:32.630]  and you kind of have to be ready to bear that cross.
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:34.270]  And it's not just out in the world.
[02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:36.470]  Plenty of you got family that's like,
[02:37:36.470 --> 02:37:39.590]  oh, fucking cousin Ricky working at the weed store.
[02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:42.350]  We should mention all the drug testing talk.
[02:37:42.350 --> 02:37:44.150]  The dispensary won't drug test you.
[02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.990]  Nope.
[02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:45.870]  Don't worry, but don't show up high either.
[02:37:45.870 --> 02:37:47.190]  Don't be an asshole.
[02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:49.710]  There's too many fucking rules to come to us, dude.
[02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:51.270]  If we can't tell you're high, it's okay.
[02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:52.670]  If we can tell you're high, you're in trouble.
[02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:53.830]  Don't be that high, asshole.
[02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:54.670]  Chill out.
[02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:56.190]  You're going to get us all in trouble.
[02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:58.390]  So the obvious problems,
[02:37:58.390 --> 02:38:00.510]  the obvious problems with working in the industry
[02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:04.190]  are banking, credit, getting a car, getting a loan.
[02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:06.270]  That kind of shit is hard.
[02:38:06.270 --> 02:38:07.390]  Shout out to my friend, Jessica.
[02:38:07.390 --> 02:38:08.670]  I asked her for guidance on this
[02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:10.470]  because she is a manager at a dispensary.
[02:38:10.470 --> 02:38:13.590]  She said the first thing she spouted off with a passion
[02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:16.870]  was fucking sexism in the cannabis industry.
[02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:18.590]  This is, she called it a boys club
[02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:20.950]  and said that this is ran by guys and she's a woman
[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:22.630]  and it's hard to be taken fucking seriously
[02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:24.270]  by all the men in this industry.
[02:38:24.270 --> 02:38:27.710]  So ladies, when you come to Colorado,
[02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:30.310]  your chances of getting a job are nearly tripled
[02:38:30.310 --> 02:38:33.230]  of what a guy with the same qualifications
[02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:35.590]  are going to have the chances of that same dude
[02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:37.070]  are going to have of getting employment.
[02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:38.310]  I know that sounds rude to say.
[02:38:38.310 --> 02:38:39.750]  They don't care what you look like
[02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:41.870]  if you're a trimmer for the most part,
[02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:43.510]  but if you're a bud tender,
[02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:46.350]  automatically hot females go to the top of the stack.
[02:38:46.350 --> 02:38:47.870]  And that's kind of true in any industry,
[02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:49.710]  but it's really true in the marijuana industry.
[02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:51.430]  It's super true in the cannabis industry, unfortunately.
[02:38:51.430 --> 02:38:53.270]  So you're going to get hired first.
[02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:54.750]  At the same time,
[02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:56.550]  everybody's going to look at your titties
[02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:59.110]  all fucking day long in the cannabis industry.
[02:38:59.110 --> 02:39:01.070]  We are used to growing weed in our basement.
[02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:02.590]  We're used to being a bunch of bros.
[02:39:02.590 --> 02:39:03.910]  It's kind of a boys club.
[02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:06.830]  We should know this by now,
[02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:09.670]  but the grow environment, the weed business environment,
[02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:10.910]  sometimes people forget
[02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:13.630]  and it gets a little bit sexist a little bit.
[02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:17.230]  So yeah, the rules that kind of apply
[02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:18.390]  to every other industry,
[02:39:18.390 --> 02:39:21.190]  like we're under so many weed specific rules
[02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:22.590]  that in a lot of ways,
[02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:24.910]  the ball gets dropped with some of the others.
[02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:27.430]  So slap us, remind us, be like boys,
[02:39:27.430 --> 02:39:30.110]  there are women in the room, behave your fucking selves.
[02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:31.790]  And a guy like myself will check myself
[02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:33.230]  after one or two of those.
[02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:35.230]  Believe me, I don't say some shit when damsel's around.
[02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:36.070]  Shout out damsel,
[02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:37.590]  I've learned to respect the ladies a little bit better
[02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:38.830]  because I've been reminded.
[02:39:38.830 --> 02:39:40.870]  So shout out to the ladies that have taught us that.
[02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:43.070]  There is some sexism in the cannabis industry.
[02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:44.710]  Be prepared for that a little bit.
[02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:49.470]  Another huge problem, you cannot consume on site.
[02:39:49.470 --> 02:39:50.790]  If you want to consume cannabis
[02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:52.390]  while you're working at a medical marijuana
[02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:54.630]  or a recreational marijuana grow facility,
[02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:57.030]  processing facility, anything like that,
[02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:59.470]  you cannot do it anywhere near the building.
[02:39:59.470 --> 02:40:01.150]  You got to go somewhere else.
[02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:03.150]  I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do.
[02:40:03.150 --> 02:40:04.990]  The cameras cannot see you.
[02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:06.950]  People that are leaving the dispensary
[02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:09.110]  should not see you consuming.
[02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:12.710]  Go far away, consume your medicine somewhere far away,
[02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:13.550]  safely, legally.
[02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:15.710]  Dude, that goes for customers too.
[02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:17.950]  Like if you're shopping in the legal weed industry,
[02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:19.710]  don't try to fucking roll a joint in the parking lot.
[02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:21.630]  Yeah, yeah, well, okay.
[02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:23.430]  Yeah, don't do that, get out of there.
[02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:26.110]  Also, something that I would mention
[02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:28.110]  is a pain in the ass in the cannabis industry.
[02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:29.110]  And you may think I'm crazy.
[02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:30.270]  Some people are gonna be like, wham,
[02:40:30.270 --> 02:40:34.350]  but there's so much tedious regulation
[02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:36.590]  and so much pressure.
[02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:38.790]  They went way overboard with the regulation.
[02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:42.630]  And like, I watch people every day
[02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:46.070]  grind up scraps of marijuana, like stems,
[02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:49.430]  like shit that you wouldn't even consider
[02:40:49.430 --> 02:40:50.790]  feeling bad about if you threw away.
[02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:52.590]  Like it's just trash.
[02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:54.830]  They have to grind it with coffee and shredded paper
[02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:57.430]  to make it indistinguishable and unusable.
[02:40:57.750 --> 02:41:01.590]  And when you translate that to a major grow,
[02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:05.310]  the amount of just how you throw out the trash
[02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:07.350]  becomes a majorly complicated process.
[02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:08.190]  So what we're forced to do-
[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:09.030]  So what we're forced to do-
[02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:09.870]  It's ridiculous.
[02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:10.830]  I run a big grow.
[02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:13.550]  We are harvesting 85 lights worth of plants.
[02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:15.310]  You make trash lasagna, right?
[02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:18.830]  So what we do, I will start a trash can
[02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:20.630]  where the trimmers are, and I'll put,
[02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:23.310]  I'll harvest a plant and I will put that pot of dirt
[02:41:23.310 --> 02:41:24.430]  in the bottom of the can.
[02:41:24.430 --> 02:41:26.470]  Now there's like a little bit of dirt in the bottom.
[02:41:26.470 --> 02:41:27.310]  And then as we trim,
[02:41:27.310 --> 02:41:28.990]  the leaves and a little bit of sticks will go in,
[02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:30.870]  and then I'll go harvest another plant,
[02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:32.870]  or maybe we've got old pots stacked up
[02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:34.790]  and I'll pour some of that dirt in there.
[02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:37.830]  And it goes dirt, leaves, dirt, leaves.
[02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:40.270]  And then like, I'll sweep up the floor and shit
[02:41:40.270 --> 02:41:41.870]  and put the sweep-ins in there.
[02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:43.550]  But you gotta mix up that weed.
[02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:45.710]  The weed shouldn't be recognizable.
[02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:49.030]  And then it has to go into a locked trash can,
[02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:51.150]  which is also behind a gate.
[02:41:52.310 --> 02:41:55.550]  And we still have had our fucking trash broken into,
[02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:56.630]  torn out of the dumpster.
[02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:59.510]  They tear the bags open and they destroy all that.
[02:41:59.510 --> 02:42:00.830]  And I gotta go fucking sweep it up
[02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:02.670]  and put the trash back in the goddamn trash can
[02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:03.870]  in the morning when I get there.
[02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:06.310]  So there are a lot of regulations.
[02:42:06.310 --> 02:42:07.870]  The regulations are ridiculous.
[02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:11.830]  I have to, everything's gotta be weighed a million times.
[02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:14.630]  Everything, and there are checks on things also.
[02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:16.990]  So it's a little bit stressful on all the regulation.
[02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:18.430]  All the pressure is crazy.
[02:42:19.270 --> 02:42:21.710]  Things have to happen at a certain time.
[02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:22.910]  Things have to be done quickly.
[02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:25.870]  You can't wait for some shit in a big grow.
[02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:28.310]  And you're on camera from 9,000 different angles.
[02:42:28.310 --> 02:42:30.870]  So don't ever think you're gonna get away with anything.
[02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:34.670]  To be on camera on every square inch takes some adjusting.
[02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:36.190]  Like, I watch it all day at work.
[02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:38.030]  People forget they're on camera.
[02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:40.470]  Or I pointed out to customers, like, we're on camera.
[02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:43.110]  Like, we can see and hear everything, stop it.
[02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.950]  Hear everything.
[02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:45.510]  Like, you're trying to get us in trouble.
[02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:48.430]  Like, why, stop fucking asking how to take weed to Texas.
[02:42:48.430 --> 02:42:49.390]  Like, we can't answer you.
[02:42:49.390 --> 02:42:50.230]  Right, yeah.
[02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:52.870]  Stop asking how many pieces of edibles you should eat.
[02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:54.550]  It's fucking one and way two hours.
[02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:55.670]  Bitch, I told you twice.
[02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:56.790]  It gets stressful.
[02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:59.670]  And also, the rules always fucking change.
[02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:02.270]  I get emails once a week with new rules.
[02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:03.110]  Yep.
[02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.950]  New rules.
[02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:05.510]  There's a special company that makes law books
[02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:08.550]  and they're on their, like, third marijuana book now.
[02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:09.390]  Wow.
[02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:10.670]  Like, you have to buy the original book
[02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:12.390]  and then the two addendum books.
[02:43:12.390 --> 02:43:14.950]  So that's most of what I've got that's stressful.
[02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:17.670]  But one thing that Mike can testify to,
[02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:19.790]  because he's a bud tender mostly,
[02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:22.470]  now the consumer is so educated
[02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:25.910]  that they expect a bud, and faux educated,
[02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:27.630]  they think they know what the fuck they're talking about,
[02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:28.470]  that they expect a bud tender.
[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:30.710]  Dude, I hear the phrase sad of a lot.
[02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:32.670]  And I hear indigo even more.
[02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:33.510]  Oh, wow.
[02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:36.070]  It's a good and a bad thing.
[02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:40.350]  I guess I'm blessed to be in the medical side of things now.
[02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:42.830]  I get a lot of that too, but honestly,
[02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:45.590]  I see kind of a more touristy side of it.
[02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:48.630]  And honestly, they just haven't had the culture
[02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:50.350]  and the community out loud and proud
[02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:51.630]  like we have here in Colorado.
[02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:54.830]  Down in Texas and in Arkansas for as long.
[02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:59.830]  But you can really tell who's been
[02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:02.710]  in the community actively and who hasn't.
[02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:05.870]  Who's been a marijuana consumer in the total shadows,
[02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:08.150]  like most of their friends don't know.
[02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:10.150]  They definitely wouldn't talk about it in public
[02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:12.550]  or on the news or on the radio.
[02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:16.030]  So they've never heard anyone say sativa before or indica.
[02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:17.070]  It's just never happened.
[02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:18.790]  They've only ever read it.
[02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:21.070]  And just thinking about that kind of boggles my mind
[02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:22.910]  a little bit, so I try to pity them a little bit.
[02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:25.710]  But when I hear it for like the 14th time on a Saturday,
[02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:27.630]  it makes me wanna cock punch somebody.
[02:44:30.270 --> 02:44:33.950]  But I saw the same thing in the wine world.
[02:44:33.950 --> 02:44:35.390]  So it exists in other places.
[02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:38.150]  People think they know a lot and they act snotty.
[02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.990]  It's funny.
[02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.670]  I love the dispensary where the buntender
[02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:43.910]  knows fucking everything and makes you feel stupid
[02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:45.910]  and doesn't realize that I'm a breeder.
[02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:48.630]  Right, I love it when they're wrong.
[02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:50.990]  I was in a shop the other day in Denver
[02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:52.750]  and I heard wrong information.
[02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:53.870]  There was a strain labeled wrong
[02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:56.230]  and I listened to the buntender go on for like four minutes
[02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:57.990]  about how it was an indica
[02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:59.550]  when it's a really popular sativa.
[02:44:59.550 --> 02:45:01.030]  And I'm just sitting there shaking my head
[02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:03.190]  as the customer gobbles it up.
[02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:04.470]  And I'm like, dude, look at the buds.
[02:45:04.470 --> 02:45:06.230]  Like I can tell that's a fucking sativa
[02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:07.070]  from over here.
[02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:08.550]  Just by the way the buds are growing, damn it.
[02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:11.110]  Stupid professional weed smokers.
[02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:13.510]  All right, Mike, thanks for coming to the show, bro.
[02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:15.070]  Happy to, man.
[02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:17.350]  You guys, that's all we've got for how to get your badge
[02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:18.190]  here in the state of Colorado.
[02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:19.430]  That's how to get your badge
[02:45:19.470 --> 02:45:21.510]  and some of the things that come along
[02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:24.470]  with that particular key to awesomeness.
[02:45:24.470 --> 02:45:27.110]  Yeah, shout out once again to that one mountain girl
[02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:28.950]  and also a huge shout out to Jessica.
[02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:31.630]  Both were huge contributors to the show.
[02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:33.950]  Also a shout out to the CD,
[02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:35.310]  the Colorado Department of Public Health
[02:45:35.310 --> 02:45:36.310]  and Environment website
[02:45:36.310 --> 02:45:38.150]  for all the information they gave me.
[02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:42.510]  I wanna give a huge shout out to everybody
[02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:43.630]  who wished me a happy birthday.
[02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:45.390]  If it was on Facebook, if it was on Instagram,
[02:45:45.390 --> 02:45:47.950]  if it was on Twitter, if it was here face to face,
[02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:49.550]  if it was through text message.
[02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:52.230]  However it was, thanks, I had a great birthday.
[02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:53.470]  The whole week has been amazing.
[02:45:53.470 --> 02:45:55.270]  We're still raging.
[02:45:55.270 --> 02:45:57.750]  It has been several days since my birthday.
[02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:59.590]  It's actually the fourth now.
[02:45:59.590 --> 02:46:01.190]  And my birthday was on the first
[02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:04.070]  and I have finally eaten all of the food and snacks
[02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:05.710]  that I was given on my birthday.
[02:46:05.710 --> 02:46:09.150]  I however have not consumed all of the Chipotle gift cards
[02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.990]  that I was given.
[02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.830]  Dope.
[02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:12.150]  Yeah, somebody gave me a Chipotle gift card.
[02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:13.390]  So I got that on deck.
[02:46:13.390 --> 02:46:16.230]  Maybe that'll be my after work treat tomorrow.
[02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:18.550]  I just went to check my phone
[02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:20.990]  to see if Chipotle was still possible.
[02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:21.830]  Not at all, bro.
[02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:23.830]  It's kind of late for Chipotle.
[02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:25.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:26.110]  So big thanks to everybody
[02:46:26.110 --> 02:46:27.390]  that hooked me up for my birthday.
[02:46:27.390 --> 02:46:30.310]  If you fed me, if you took me out, if you dad me out,
[02:46:30.310 --> 02:46:32.110]  if you gave me some solventless hash
[02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:34.950]  that I pressed into one giant fucking dad, big shout out.
[02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:37.670]  If you dad me out with Spherix, big shout out.
[02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:40.110]  Also big shout out to my friends at the Cana Canyon.
[02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:43.390]  I dropped into the Cana Canyon yesterday and hung out.
[02:46:43.390 --> 02:46:45.070]  Everybody in there dad me out.
[02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:46.430]  Everybody in there was happy to see me.
[02:46:46.430 --> 02:46:47.790]  Big shout out to the Cana Canyon.
[02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:49.190]  If you're ever in Colorado Springs
[02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:51.350]  and you need a place to stop and kill a few minutes,
[02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:54.390]  you wanna smoke down, I always recommend the Cana Canyon.
[02:46:54.390 --> 02:46:57.710]  It's on Colorado Boulevard, Colorado Avenue.
[02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:59.630]  It's on Colorado.
[02:46:59.630 --> 02:47:00.470]  It's not hard to find.
[02:47:00.470 --> 02:47:02.670]  If you Google the Cana Canyon in Colorado Springs,
[02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:03.550]  you will get there.
[02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:05.390]  Tell Camille that Rasta Jeff sent you,
[02:47:05.390 --> 02:47:07.230]  that you listen to the Grow From the Heart podcast.
[02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:10.110]  She will treat you like royalty.
[02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:12.150]  That's what I think I've got for you this week, you guys.
[02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:13.510]  I do have more episodes planned.
[02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:15.550]  I'm gonna do an episode with a bunch of lovely ladies
[02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:18.310]  and we'll talk about women and cannabis.
[02:47:18.310 --> 02:47:20.190]  What else do we have?
[02:47:20.190 --> 02:47:21.670]  Anyway, it'll be in the future anyway.
[02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:23.110]  We don't have to talk too much about what's coming up.
[02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:24.430]  My little notebook is over there.
[02:47:24.430 --> 02:47:25.270]  I'm not gonna reach for it.
[02:47:25.270 --> 02:47:26.470]  Mike, I wanna thank you for hanging out, dude.
[02:47:26.470 --> 02:47:28.150]  You had to leave the little guy at home.
[02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:29.910]  I hope you didn't miss him too much while you're here.
[02:47:29.910 --> 02:47:31.390]  I'm gonna let you get back to him real soon.
[02:47:31.390 --> 02:47:32.550]  Yeah, it was about that time,
[02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:33.830]  but it's good to be here, man.
[02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:36.030]  I heard an episode a little while back.
[02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:38.230]  Someone mentioned missing me on the shows.
[02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:39.070]  Yes.
[02:47:39.070 --> 02:47:40.950]  Dude, I'm trying to be here, man.
[02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:43.670]  Life got crazy, but this is still important to me
[02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:45.710]  and I wanna be here as often as I can,
[02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:47.830]  but that's not as often as I would like right now.
[02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:50.070]  So I apologize for my absence
[02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:52.110]  and I hope you like me on the show lately.
[02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:54.190]  That was our buddy Mike O was his name?
[02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:55.510]  Yep, I thought it was Mike O.
[02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:59.030]  He sent a couple of emails, which I like repeated updates.
[02:47:59.030 --> 02:48:00.390]  Yeah, well, he was a little pissed off
[02:48:00.390 --> 02:48:01.750]  that you hadn't been here for a little while.
[02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:03.030]  He was kinda upset with the show.
[02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:06.950]  Life exploded and the show had to take a back burner
[02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:07.790]  for a while.
[02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:10.270]  For a minute there, it was a big part
[02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:12.070]  of my extracurricular activities
[02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:14.310]  and I just sort of that time got filled big time.
[02:48:14.310 --> 02:48:15.830]  Yeah, man, I don't blame you at all.
[02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:17.590]  That kid is the most important thing in your world
[02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:18.550]  as it should be.
[02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:20.710]  Nope, but yeah, the show is still a priority.
[02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:22.950]  So we're recording real late at night.
[02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:24.870]  Like we said, Chipotle be fucking closed.
[02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:25.710]  That sucks.
[02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:28.590]  So yeah, we're scratching it out,
[02:48:28.590 --> 02:48:31.910]  but I wanted to be part of the show, getting a badge.
[02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:33.230]  I've seen so many people fucked
[02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:35.150]  because they didn't know this information
[02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:37.430]  before they made a big leap.
[02:48:38.430 --> 02:48:41.470]  And I really wanted to be a part of this show.
[02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:42.950]  So yeah, sorry for the ramblings.
[02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:44.630]  Hope you got the information you need.
[02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:46.150]  Because knowing is half the battle.
[02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:47.790]  Knowing's fucking half the battle, people.
[02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:49.270]  All right, you guys, I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[02:48:49.270 --> 02:48:50.510]  Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:53.070]  I will be back in seven days with another episode.
[02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:54.950]  I'm not sure what I'm gonna put out for you in seven days.
[02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:56.870]  I've got a lot of stuff written down.
[02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:58.790]  It'll be great, I promise you that.
[02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:59.870]  Make sure you tune in.
[02:48:59.870 --> 02:49:01.870]  Make sure you check out the show on iTunes, Stitcher,

[02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:07.150]  We do not have any sponsors on this episode.
[02:49:07.870 --> 02:49:08.870]  If you wanna sponsor the podcast,
[02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:10.590]  or if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[02:49:10.590 --> 02:49:11.430]  send me an email.

[02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:18.950]  I was able to dab this new Earl called Spherix
[02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:20.510]  last night at the Cannon Canyon.
[02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:22.350]  I only took one dab of it so far.
[02:49:22.350 --> 02:49:23.550]  It's got my fucking attention.
[02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:26.390]  So check that product out if you're in Colorado.
[02:49:26.390 --> 02:49:27.790]  If you've got something you want me to review,

[02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:35.870]  The show is aimed at a cannabis community.
[02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:37.150]  So if you've got a cannabis product,
[02:49:37.150 --> 02:49:41.070]  this would be the perfect avenue to show off your wares.
[02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:42.790]  You guys, I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:45.110]  Big thanks to everybody out there in the cannabis community
[02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:47.470]  who's doing their thing, who's making this shit happen.
[02:49:47.470 --> 02:49:49.270]  You guys, I wanna give a big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:49:49.270 --> 02:49:51.310]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[02:49:51.310 --> 02:49:52.910]  and give your mom a hug for me.

[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:43.860]  But you've got to kill off the one you'd want.
[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:46.340]  But I wish to God you never hurt no one.
[02:50:46.340 --> 02:50:49.540]  But you've got to kill off the one you'd want.
[02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:51.620]  You see now, girls and guns,
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:53.060]  guns and girls,
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.900]  come together like the diamond and pearl.
