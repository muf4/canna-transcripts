[01:38.100 --> 01:39.100]  I want to say thank you.
[01:39.100 --> 01:42.700]  Thank you guys for all of the feedback on a couple of previous episodes.
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.600]  The last episode was not my favorite show.
[01:45.800 --> 01:49.400]  It was an episode dedicated to a friend who we lost to a drunk driver.
[01:49.500 --> 01:54.000]  Thank you for all of the condolences all of the love all of the support all of the feedback.
[01:54.200 --> 02:00.500]  I did try to include a link to the go fund me to the PayPal account to support my friend's wife in the show notes.
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.600]  However, YouTube is removing those links.
[02:03.700 --> 02:07.400]  I couldn't put the link in the show notes or the video description or in the comments.
[02:07.400 --> 02:08.300]  It keeps taking it out.
[02:08.300 --> 02:12.300]  It keeps flagging that if I keep trying to put it in there, they will take down my video.
[02:12.300 --> 02:14.200]  So I couldn't put the description up there.
[02:14.500 --> 02:19.500]  If you would like a link on how to help contribute to my friend, I help his wife help out with funeral costs.
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.300]  Send me a message.
[02:20.300 --> 02:21.300]  We will get you a link.
[02:21.300 --> 02:23.000]  Also stabby has been posting the link.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.200]  A lot of my other friends have posted the link on other social media platforms.
[02:26.500 --> 02:29.500]  I will post it on cannabis because they will not take it down.
[02:29.500 --> 02:36.900]  Shout out to cannabis, but I wanted to make sure to say thank you for all of the love all of the support all of the hugs and virtual kisses.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.100]  It meant a lot to me.
[02:38.200 --> 02:40.700]  I did receive that and it did make me feel a lot better.
[02:40.700 --> 02:42.100]  So thank you guys for that.
[02:42.300 --> 02:46.000]  Also, thank you for all of the feedback on the visual AIDS episode.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.500]  I did an episode where I dropped in a lot of fancy pictures and photos tried to teach a lot tried to up my game.
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.700]  Thank you for all of the feedback and compliments on that episode.
[02:54.700 --> 02:56.300]  I spent a lot of time doing that.
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.300]  It took me a lot of time learning how to do that learning video editing software.
[03:00.300 --> 03:05.100]  There comes a lot of points in time when you just want to smash your head straight into the computer screen a few times.
[03:05.300 --> 03:06.400]  I've avoided all of that.
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.200]  We've gotten a lot of work done.
[03:08.300 --> 03:09.800]  Thank you guys for all of the feedback.
[03:09.800 --> 03:17.000]  It makes it worth it taking all that time to learn it figure it out produce it all of the feedback all of the compliments that makes all of that worth it.
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.800]  You guys told me that the show is improved a lot that makes all of my efforts worth it when you guys notice it.
[03:22.800 --> 03:23.700]  So thank you guys.
[03:23.700 --> 03:26.100]  I'm having fun learning video editing software.
[03:26.300 --> 03:31.400]  It has been a really fun time and I've got some great friends out there that give me some great advice tech tips.
[03:31.500 --> 03:33.000]  So thank you guys for that.
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.900]  Also, I want to thank you for the great feedback recently.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.900]  I co-hosted the dude grows show with my buddy the dude and guru.
[03:41.900 --> 03:44.500]  I filled that filled in for my good friend Scotty real.
[03:44.900 --> 03:49.700]  I got a lot of great compliments a lot of great feedback on that podcast.
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.200]  Thank you.
[03:50.200 --> 03:53.200]  I had a really good time the dude Scotty guru.
[03:53.200 --> 03:56.500]  I look forward to hanging out with or without any of you on there.
[03:56.500 --> 04:01.700]  If anybody needs a fill in if you need a replacement, let me know I could pull almost any of those jobs.
[04:01.700 --> 04:03.000]  I think I can do gurus job.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.600]  I can almost keep up with you guru.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  You do the the tech and the knowledge all at the same time.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.400]  So big shout out for that, but I'm rambling I was on the dude grows podcast.
[04:12.400 --> 04:18.600]  If you did not catch that make sure you watch that it is available on their all of their feeds on their YouTube feed.
[04:18.600 --> 04:20.100]  It's on their podcasting feed.
[04:20.100 --> 04:29.000]  If it's Apple podcast Spotify stitcher wherever you find the dude grow show, make sure you check out the episode co-hosted by yours truly Rasta Jeff.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.500]  I had a really good time on that podcast.
[04:30.500 --> 04:31.400]  I had a lot of fun.
[04:31.800 --> 04:42.200]  I was trying not to interrupt too much because we know that our friend Scotty real does kind of but in a little bit with a lot of stuff to say I didn't want to overrun the show because I'm not the regular member of that show.
[04:42.200 --> 04:48.400]  I wanted to be a good gracious guest also had to fill my shoes had to pull my own weight and be involved.
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.000]  So it's hard to find that borderline there, but I think we did a good job on the show.
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.300]  Thanks to everybody for the compliments the comments the feedback.
[04:55.300 --> 04:58.300]  If you haven't seen it go watch it leave some comments on the video.
[04:58.400 --> 05:03.000]  Most importantly let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you so, you know to go watch that show.
[05:03.700 --> 05:07.500]  What am I going to talk about before we get to the birthday celebration?
[05:07.500 --> 05:12.400]  I wrote down the words super stony tolerance swings.
[05:12.600 --> 05:13.400]  Holy shit.
[05:13.400 --> 05:15.500]  I may have talked about this in the past on the show.
[05:15.500 --> 05:17.200]  It may have been a long time.
[05:17.400 --> 05:19.100]  How about you right now?
[05:19.100 --> 05:26.500]  I'm going through a phase where I can basically open up my jar of concentrates and just look at it and be stoned out of my fucking dome.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.200]  I go through phases where the guy at the dispensary is like bro.
[05:30.200 --> 05:32.900]  You were here yesterday and I'm like, I know I know trust me.
[05:32.900 --> 05:39.500]  I know and then I go through phases like today where I could just look at the jar and be fucking wrecked all day long right now.
[05:39.500 --> 05:45.300]  I'm going through one of those phases where I could take one dab and I get so high and then I go through it'll probably last a week.
[05:45.300 --> 05:53.400]  Maybe three days four or five days, maybe a week tops and then next week I'll go buy concentrates and I will smoke all of the concentrates and not even get a nice buzz.
[05:53.600 --> 05:57.300]  So do you go through weird shifts and swings in your tolerance?
[05:57.700 --> 06:01.200]  I definitely notice it is based on a lot of is based on my hydration.
[06:01.200 --> 06:02.600]  I haven't been hydrating properly.
[06:02.600 --> 06:10.400]  I've been a little extra physically busy been working a little bit more physically been in a grow a little bit more and that's dehydrating me a little bit.
[06:10.400 --> 06:13.100]  I'm wondering if that's contributing to the extra buzz.
[06:13.100 --> 06:19.300]  I've been getting my diet has changed a little honestly been eating more food and still getting extra high when I smoke.
[06:19.300 --> 06:22.800]  So I'm curious send me some feedback wherever you interact with me.
[06:23.300 --> 06:29.300]  Do you go through phases where sometimes you can smoke all of the product and not get stoned at all?
[06:29.300 --> 06:34.300]  And then sometimes you go through phases where you smoke a little bit of the product and you're fucking wrecked for the day.
[06:34.300 --> 06:37.500]  Do you go through phases ebbs and flows like that with your tolerance?
[06:37.500 --> 06:38.700]  Give me some feedback.
[06:38.700 --> 06:40.000]  You can hit me up on Twitter.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.800]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[06:41.800 --> 06:43.400]  You can find me on Instagram.
[06:43.400 --> 06:48.800]  It is at I re underscore genetics or of course there is an Instagram for the show.
[06:48.800 --> 06:50.000]  I don't use it very often.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.400]  It is the grow from your heart podcast on Instagram.
[06:52.500 --> 06:54.100]  Of course, there is cannabis.
[06:54.100 --> 06:56.900]  I love cannabis leave a comment in the YouTube video.
[06:56.900 --> 06:58.300]  Just give me some feedback.
[06:58.300 --> 07:03.000]  Let me know am I the only one that goes through these weird ebbs and flows of tolerance.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  I didn't take a tolerance break or anything.
[07:05.000 --> 07:05.900]  I've been smoking.
[07:05.900 --> 07:09.300]  I did a tolerance break a while back, but I mean I'm back on the train.
[07:09.300 --> 07:10.000]  We've been smoking.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.700]  We've been puffing but man the past couple of days I could take a dab and it's like high school high blow out the dab and I'm like,
[07:16.700 --> 07:22.100]  oh, I'm silly got to take a couple of seconds got to get a couple of snacks in me got to recharge.
[07:22.200 --> 07:27.200]  Anyway, if you can't tell today's one of them days when I got fucking high as shit from just a couple of dabs.
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.900]  So so totally super rambly and here's where we are going to get serious.
[07:32.900 --> 07:36.200]  I'm going to shift gears here really quickly and this isn't going to last for very long.
[07:36.200 --> 07:42.800]  We're going to get out of this but this is required as a responsible person with a microphone with a platform is a fucking human.
[07:42.800 --> 07:45.500]  This is something that I feel I'm responsible to do.
[07:45.500 --> 07:47.000]  I need to take a moment.
[07:47.000 --> 07:57.800]  We need to take a moment to send some love some vibes some hugs some healing energy to all of the victims in the recent tragedies,
[07:57.800 --> 08:03.300]  which have swept our nation there have been some terrible domestic terrorism some shootings,
[08:03.300 --> 08:04.600]  whatever you want to label it.
[08:04.600 --> 08:06.700]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[08:06.700 --> 08:08.000]  It's a mental health problem.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.600]  I don't know if it's a gun problem a mental health problem.
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.500]  This is not the podcast for that.
[08:12.500 --> 08:15.400]  It's a mental health issue in my opinion.
[08:15.400 --> 08:20.000]  I don't know what to do about it what to say about it other than holy shit.
[08:20.000 --> 08:20.500]  This sucks.
[08:20.500 --> 08:24.200]  It's fucked up people are broken things are rough.
[08:24.200 --> 08:36.800]  I want to take a minute to send some love some of my heart some of my energy some jaw love to all of the victims of all of the terrible shootings that have happened recently the victims of violence terrorism.
[08:36.800 --> 08:39.000]  We'll start with the victims here in Colorado.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.500]  Let's send a big big moment of silence here.
[08:41.500 --> 08:49.900]  Just a brief second of silence for everybody in Boulder who not only the people who lost their lives the people who witnessed it the people who were affected by it the sort of thing leaves big ripple.
[08:49.900 --> 08:54.800]  So brief moment for everybody up there in Boulder who was affected by this one quick moment of silence here.
[08:54.800 --> 08:55.200]  It is.
[08:57.500 --> 09:03.200]  All right, that was for all of our people in Boulder another another mention for all of the people in Georgia.
[09:03.200 --> 09:05.000]  There is another tragedy in Georgia.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.100]  You know, you can't just be specific and do this for the ones that we are aware of for the ones that hit home that were local.
[09:11.100 --> 09:22.500]  I want to do a moment of silence a little fucking jaw love for everybody who's been dealing with some bullshit who's been a victim of some bullshit if your car got broken into if there was terrorism if you're just feeling sorrow.
[09:22.500 --> 09:24.900]  Here's a little bit of jaw love a little moment for you.
[09:24.900 --> 09:29.000]  Here's a big fist bump for you, but let's just take a second put some energy out there together right now.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  You guys let's just put some love into the air some healing energy some Rastafari or whatever you believe in feel it put some love out there.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.100]  Let's do it together for just one second on the count of three one two three Rastafari.
[09:41.100 --> 09:44.700]  All right, that is for everybody out there feeling some effects of some sort of tragedy.
[09:44.700 --> 09:52.300]  If it was a shooting in Boulder if it was a shooting in Georgia, if it was something across the planet that I'm not aware of if it's something inside of you some turmoil.
[09:52.300 --> 09:56.600]  Hopefully we can all do some energy work together get us all through that together.
[09:56.700 --> 10:00.600]  All right, I got weird on this podcast where we go from there.
[10:01.400 --> 10:03.600]  We got to do our best you guys this is a weird time.
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.400]  We got to do our best bring everybody together.
[10:05.400 --> 10:09.600]  The place we go from there is talking about celebrating a podcast birthday.
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.300]  What oh my goodness you guys I can't think of many other things.
[10:14.300 --> 10:15.800]  I've been doing for seven years.
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.600]  This is the seventh year of the grow from your heart podcast.
[10:19.600 --> 10:22.400]  This episode will come out on March 25th.
[10:22.500 --> 10:24.200]  Speaking of March 25th.
[10:24.200 --> 10:27.400]  Happy birthday to one of my best friends on the planet.
[10:27.400 --> 10:30.000]  Happy birthday to Rob the dude.
[10:30.000 --> 10:38.600]  If you know Rob the dude send him some birthday love even if you don't know Rob the dude send him some birthday love Robbie and I went to high school together.
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.200]  I moved to Colorado in the middle of high school made good friends with Robbie shortly after that.
[10:44.200 --> 10:50.400]  We ended up going to a bunch of fish concerts and fish related concerts and mo shows lots of mo.
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.300]  We even did a little bit of string cheese and a lot of widespread panic concerts.
[10:54.300 --> 10:58.800]  We've been to a lot of shows together you guys Robbie and I have done a lot of miles in the car together.
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.500]  We've been to a lot of States together.
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.400]  We've been on planes trains and automobiles together.
[11:03.400 --> 11:06.500]  We've been around this whole fucking country together having a good time.
[11:06.500 --> 11:16.200]  He was my road dog for more than half of my fish experiences 90% of my widespread panic experiences have got Robbie the dude right next to me for those.
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.300]  So without that dude, I wouldn't be who how what where I am today.
[11:21.300 --> 11:24.100]  He's played a huge role in who and what and how and where I am.
[11:24.100 --> 11:27.100]  So I need to send a big shout out to my buddy Rob the dude.
[11:27.100 --> 11:28.000]  Happy birthday, bro.
[11:28.000 --> 11:28.300]  Love you.
[11:28.300 --> 11:28.800]  Miss you.
[11:28.900 --> 11:31.200]  He's in Massachusetts right now being a mass hole.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.300]  Hope you're well brother.
[11:32.600 --> 11:33.400]  I hope you hear this.
[11:33.400 --> 11:35.500]  You're not technologically advanced.
[11:35.500 --> 11:40.400]  You're kind of living in the Stone Ages the stoned ages if you will, but I hope you hear this brother big shout out.
[11:40.400 --> 11:40.900]  Love you, bro.
[11:40.900 --> 11:41.800]  Hope you have a good birthday.
[11:42.100 --> 11:45.300]  You'll definitely get some text messages and some harassing phone calls from me.
[11:45.800 --> 11:46.900]  So shout out to my buddy Robbie.
[11:46.900 --> 11:49.000]  Anyway, this comes out on March 25th.
[11:49.100 --> 11:52.600]  The podcast birthday is officially March 28th.
[11:52.600 --> 11:55.300]  This will be seven years of podcasting.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.900]  I said I haven't done anything for seven years.
[11:58.200 --> 11:59.500]  I've done some shit for seven years guys.
[11:59.500 --> 12:01.500]  I've been a parent for nearly 18 years.
[12:01.500 --> 12:04.400]  I've had these dreadlocks for fucking 16.
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.400]  Holy shit.
[12:05.900 --> 12:10.700]  So I've been doing some things but seven years of podcasting some of you are brand new at listening.
[12:10.700 --> 12:13.200]  Some of you may this may be your first episode listening.
[12:13.300 --> 12:18.700]  Some of you may have listened since episode one when the show was called the I grow culture podcast.
[12:18.700 --> 12:20.300]  Let's ramble about that for a moment.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  Oh, by the way, there's not going to be any grow talk or anything like that in this episode.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.700]  This is all just going to be a birthday celebration.
[12:25.700 --> 12:29.700]  I'm going to ramble and regroup from the past couple of episodes which have been stressful.
[12:29.800 --> 12:33.500]  We're going to have a good time and then after this one, we're going to jump deep into the grow lessons again.
[12:34.500 --> 12:38.600]  But back in the day the show was called the I grow culture podcast.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.300]  I started off with I grow culture is episode one.
[12:41.600 --> 12:44.300]  It was a play on like iPad iPod.
[12:44.300 --> 12:49.200]  I everything it was a lowercase I and then the word grow with a capital G.
[12:49.200 --> 12:52.300]  I grow like iPad, you know what I'm saying?
[12:52.300 --> 12:53.700]  Right all the Apple stuff.
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.300]  So it's I grow culture because it was the I grow I was growing some culture.
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.700]  I was growing cannabis culture.
[13:00.900 --> 13:07.000]  I was growing we were cultivating and it was also a play on the word agriculture is where I was going with that.
[13:07.100 --> 13:08.100]  I grow culture.
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.900]  It was also a little bit of when you put I and stuff it makes it a little Rastafari feel that's a whole nother Avenue.
[13:12.900 --> 13:20.800]  If you understand the Rastafari lingo, then you get that but about 30 or 40 episodes into the I grow culture podcast.
[13:20.800 --> 13:25.900]  I received a cease and desist letter from a company called I grow culture.
[13:26.000 --> 13:26.600]  That's right.
[13:26.700 --> 13:35.900]  They were a college accredited company who made courses for colleges for agricultural studies.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.700]  So they were teaching like Ag schools.
[13:37.700 --> 13:46.400]  They were the ones making the books for the agriculture schools and they kindly said hey, we see you've got a new podcast or a few episodes in we would appreciate it.
[13:46.400 --> 13:55.800]  If you stop using the word I grow culture and if you do continue to use that then we will have to have our lawyers step in and sue the shit out of you.
[13:55.900 --> 13:57.200]  It's not exactly what they said.
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.100]  I'm paraphrasing but that was when I decided, you know, I don't really like the word.
[14:01.100 --> 14:01.900]  I grow culture.
[14:01.900 --> 14:03.600]  Anyway, I thought about it.
[14:04.100 --> 14:08.400]  My company is the growth or my company is I read genetics premium seeds.
[14:08.700 --> 14:15.900]  The slogan for I read genetics was grow from your heart and breed with love and I thought that grow from your heart is what we do.
[14:15.900 --> 14:16.500]  It's what I do.
[14:16.500 --> 14:18.300]  It's what I'd like to teach you to do.
[14:18.400 --> 14:19.700]  It's what the show is about.
[14:19.700 --> 14:21.700]  I'm giving you free grow lessons.
[14:21.700 --> 14:23.100]  You're getting free content.
[14:23.200 --> 14:25.800]  You're learning how to grow your product for free.
[14:25.900 --> 14:27.700]  I'm giving it to you from my heart.
[14:27.700 --> 14:29.900]  I would appreciate you to grow from your heart.
[14:29.900 --> 14:32.900]  So it felt natural grow from your heart podcast.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.900]  So that happened at episode 50 at episode 50.
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.400]  I rebranded everything.
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.000]  I had a new logo made I redid.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.600]  I actually re branded with a new YouTube channel because I couldn't redo all the words and all the names.
[14:45.800 --> 14:47.500]  So I created a brand new YouTube channel.
[14:47.500 --> 14:53.800]  I changed all the logos everywhere else changed all the names and we became the grow from your heart podcast at episode 50.
[14:55.400 --> 14:57.700]  My point was a lot of you may be brand new.
[14:57.700 --> 15:00.000]  A lot of you probably jumped in right in the middle.
[15:00.200 --> 15:07.100]  Many of you jumped in when I started doing the video podcast around episode 500 is when I think that happened 520 ish.
[15:07.100 --> 15:08.000]  Maybe three something.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.200]  I don't even know it's been so long, but many of you jumped in when the video started on YouTube.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.000]  So thank you for that.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.500]  But many of you have been here since the beginning and it is crazy to think that you guys have been listening to me for seven years.
[15:20.600 --> 15:29.700]  What blows my mind is when somebody says, hey, dude, I discovered your podcast yesterday and I've already listened to like 400 episodes or something of your show and I'm like, oh my goodness.
[15:29.900 --> 15:32.400]  These people have heard me from back in the day.
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.200]  I used to write out entire podcast like type them out on paper and read it like a script.
[15:37.200 --> 15:55.900]  So today we will be doing episode 325 of the grow from your heart podcast brought to you by our friends at seeds here now.com make sure and I would just read it like that and I didn't I didn't flow it and feel good and now I just turn on the mic and I've got like five bullet points on the screen and we just fucking talk for 30 or 40 minutes and hopefully don't have to edit too much shit out.
[15:55.900 --> 15:57.000]  The show has progressed.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.100]  I feel like I have grown so far as a podcaster.
[16:00.100 --> 16:05.900]  I feel like I've grown a lot as a cultivator commercial cultivator a home cultivator.
[16:06.100 --> 16:08.400]  Also, I feel like I've grown so much as a teacher.
[16:08.400 --> 16:15.400]  I understand so much better how to guide you to success now, but I feel like we've come a long way together.
[16:15.700 --> 16:19.900]  So my main point of that ramble was some of you are new some of you been here forever.
[16:19.900 --> 16:21.500]  Some of you been here right in the middle.
[16:21.700 --> 16:32.300]  Thank each and every one of you for listening to me for supporting me for encouraging me for emailing me for commenting on my videos my audio posts.
[16:32.800 --> 16:37.100]  Thank you for the compliments and noticing my progression.
[16:37.300 --> 16:46.500]  I went from having a terrible audio quality sound that was over compressed and sound tinny focused way too much on just the wrong stuff.
[16:46.500 --> 16:51.000]  I didn't know I was new at podcasting then we improved the sound then we improved the video.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.700]  Now we're in 4k most of the time.
[16:53.700 --> 16:54.400]  It's in 4k.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.600]  I record in 4k.
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.700]  Sometimes YouTube doesn't fucking let me post it in 4k, but that's hey, that's that's another story.
[17:00.700 --> 17:01.500]  We're in 4k.
[17:01.500 --> 17:01.900]  Now.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  We got the Joe Rogan microphone coming to you.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.600]  Boom in the set looks good.
[17:05.700 --> 17:08.200]  I feel like we've come a long way and you guys have noticed it.
[17:08.200 --> 17:12.800]  So the the compliments and the compliments is what it is encouragement that keeps me going.
[17:12.800 --> 17:13.600]  So thank you.
[17:14.500 --> 17:15.700]  I'm really rambling.
[17:15.900 --> 17:20.900]  I just wanted to make sure to give thanks and praise for you guys to you guys for all of the support because.
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.500]  I do put a lot of work into it.
[17:22.500 --> 17:26.200]  I write the shows I produce the shows that come and ramble for 30 or 40 minutes.
[17:26.200 --> 17:29.600]  I edit it down make it look shiny put all kinds of video touches to it.
[17:29.600 --> 17:31.900]  Then I put it out there and just hope you guys accept it.
[17:33.300 --> 17:38.000]  But without an audience, it would just be some weirdo talking into a microphone with a bunch of toys.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.400]  This would just be all me and this would just be fucking weird.
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.300]  So thank you guys.
[17:41.500 --> 17:42.300]  I appreciate you.
[17:42.300 --> 17:43.800]  I love you and I respect you now.
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.700]  Let's get a little deeper into all of these.
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.400]  Thanks notes.
[17:47.800 --> 17:49.500]  I want to send a big thanks to Mike.
[17:49.600 --> 17:51.600]  Mike is an integral part of this podcast.
[17:51.600 --> 17:53.000]  He's not on enough episodes.
[17:53.000 --> 17:53.800]  Mike's a busy man.
[17:53.800 --> 17:54.600]  He's got a family.
[17:54.800 --> 17:55.800]  He's got children.
[17:56.300 --> 17:57.200]  He's got his own life.
[17:57.200 --> 17:59.600]  I understand that but Mike, thank you, bro.
[17:59.900 --> 18:02.000]  Nothing but love respect and appreciation for you.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.800]  It's time to get you back on the podcast again.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.700]  The audience loves you.
[18:05.000 --> 18:05.400]  I love you.
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.900]  The show loves you big.
[18:06.900 --> 18:07.600]  Thanks to Mike.
[18:07.700 --> 18:09.300]  He contributes a lot to the show.
[18:09.600 --> 18:16.300]  Maybe sometimes he won't be on the show, but he'll send me a message and say make sure you talk about this or he'll say when you talk about this, make sure to cover this point.
[18:16.500 --> 18:20.400]  So Mike is a big part of the show behind the scenes behind the camera in front of the camera.
[18:20.600 --> 18:21.100]  Thank you, bro.
[18:21.100 --> 18:22.200]  I appreciate that.
[18:22.300 --> 18:23.100]  I want to thank Mike.
[18:23.100 --> 18:27.400]  I want to thank all of the guests who have been on the show everybody from day one.
[18:28.400 --> 18:37.300]  Kevin Mike Spence Maddie Garden of Weed in Joe Buzzy Jesse grows, especially sloppy has been on the show.
[18:37.800 --> 18:43.100]  I'm going to miss somebody barefoot organic as fuck everybody that's been on the show.
[18:43.300 --> 18:44.000]  Thank you.
[18:44.100 --> 18:45.000]  I appreciate it.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  It's been awesome.
[18:47.300 --> 18:50.900]  You guys make the show without you guys coming on the show without you being a part of the show.
[18:50.900 --> 18:52.800]  The show wouldn't grow shout out to a double door.
[18:52.800 --> 18:54.400]  Dank out.
[18:54.400 --> 18:55.700]  It should send some love to double door.
[18:55.700 --> 18:58.700]  Dank actually you guys double doors been dealing with some health issues.
[18:58.700 --> 19:00.600]  So let's send him some jaw love as well.
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.200]  But thanks all the people that have been on the show.
[19:02.200 --> 19:15.000]  I'm sure I missed several guests there that I did not mention because we've had quite a few people on the show, but thank you guys all the people that have gathered at the table in the past in the present and in the future even friends that have fallen off.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.300]  We've had some falling outs.
[19:16.300 --> 19:18.800]  We've had some some rifts in the force here.
[19:18.800 --> 19:31.000]  If you will still big shout out to all those people that were on the show without you guys the show wouldn't have existed and people say hey, why do you leave up some of those episodes that person has proved themselves to be a phony or has proved themselves to be a fool since they were on your show.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.100]  Why do you leave it up?
[19:32.300 --> 19:44.900]  I can't change history taking down a podcast episode is not going to change the fact that we were cool at that point that we were friends at that point that episode that knowledge that info is still probably valid and then we can see what that person is.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.500]  Evolved into some people have changed some people wearing masks.
[19:48.600 --> 19:51.400]  Some people have really evolved into bigger and better people.
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.300]  Some people have been abandoned and deleted and blocked completely.
[19:54.400 --> 20:04.000]  So the reason I don't take down those messages are those old episodes is because it's a time capsule the podcast happened to those things were said I'm kind of a historian here doing this.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  So that's why some of the episodes if you ask why do you leave that up?
[20:07.100 --> 20:12.400]  It's a time capsule can't change history just by deleting an episode can't change the future by deleting an episode.
[20:12.900 --> 20:13.300]  All right.
[20:13.300 --> 20:19.700]  So thanks to all of the guests past present and future even if we don't kick it anymore, even if I don't rep your brand or you don't rep my shit.
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.300]  Thank you.
[20:20.400 --> 20:22.100]  It was still worth having you on the show.
[20:22.800 --> 20:27.500]  Also, thank you to all of the shows which have had me as a guest.
[20:27.900 --> 20:29.900]  I've been on a lot of podcasts.
[20:29.900 --> 20:36.000]  I think the first show I appeared on may have been John Doe radio with Tim Martin.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.500]  What that's some old-school shit Tim.
[20:38.500 --> 20:39.900]  I'd love to see you get moving again.
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.400]  You talk about getting it fired up.
[20:41.500 --> 20:42.500]  Maybe you've gotten it going.
[20:42.500 --> 20:43.700]  I haven't seen it on iTunes.
[20:43.700 --> 20:53.900]  I look for you occasionally if the John Doe radio fired up again, I would give it a follow but Tim Martin was one of the reasons why I started the show his show inspired me.
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.700]  There were a lot of shows that inspired me.
[20:55.700 --> 20:57.300]  We don't need to go too far into that.
[20:57.700 --> 21:05.000]  But I was talking a lot about cannabis teaching my friends and then somebody asked me the same question like three times in a row and I thought I should record this and do it.
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.100]  That's why a podcast started but thanks to all the people that had me as a guest.
[21:09.100 --> 21:11.300]  I was on John Doe radio that got me started.
[21:11.700 --> 21:13.400]  I've been on the dude gross show.
[21:13.400 --> 21:18.600]  I've been on medical marijuana radio with our friend LS love down there in New Mexico.
[21:18.900 --> 21:19.900]  I've been on okay.
[21:19.900 --> 21:20.400]  So here's one.
[21:20.400 --> 21:32.500]  We should really make sure to touch on big shout out to the gang at embracing organics embracing organics invited me to be on their video zoom podcast, which goes live on YouTube.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.500]  I was hesitant for a couple of reasons at the time.
[21:35.500 --> 21:37.200]  I wasn't doing video shows.
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.900]  I wasn't prepared or comfortable to go on video.
[21:40.200 --> 21:42.900]  Also, I wasn't doing live shows at the time.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.500]  So I was about to be on camera live.
[21:45.600 --> 21:46.800]  That was really nerve-wracking.
[21:46.800 --> 21:52.700]  It was a little uh, made me nervous to be honest with you, but we did it and after that there was no turning back.
[21:52.700 --> 21:56.300]  Now I get on the microphone and I talk and I ramble and this is like where I live.
[21:56.300 --> 21:57.500]  This is my space right here.
[21:57.500 --> 21:59.600]  I feel so good in the podcasting zone.
[22:00.200 --> 22:03.100]  I don't know that I would have gotten comfortable on the video.
[22:03.100 --> 22:08.800]  I don't know that I would have learned the live zoom stuff without my buddy Dirtman Dan and the embracing organics crew.
[22:09.400 --> 22:11.500]  So we all owe a special.
[22:11.500 --> 22:21.400]  Thank you to Dirtman Dan and embracing organics because I wouldn't be doing this show the way I'm doing it without that encouragement without that shift without that boost.
[22:21.400 --> 22:23.200]  It was good practice and it got me going.
[22:23.200 --> 22:24.100]  So thank you bro.
[22:24.100 --> 22:30.000]  You guys really did contribute to my show to my success by showing me the way on how to do it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.400]  You guys made me really confident being on those shows showing me how to do the zoom stuff that made me really confident and knowing that I've got such a
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.800]  cool team of fucking nerds and Grove Geeks behind me.
[22:42.800 --> 22:49.200]  If I've got a computer question a zoom question a fucking YouTube question a an equipment question.
[22:49.200 --> 22:50.400]  I have got three guys.
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.100]  I can call I'm like thousands of people's weed guys.
[22:53.100 --> 23:00.800]  So it's really relieving knowing that I've got tech guys camera guys camera gals that I can message and call and be like, hey, I'm trying to do this.
[23:00.800 --> 23:06.200]  I can't figure it out and I go dude just mix a and B and press C and you're like, oh, I was fucking so easy.

[23:12.400 --> 23:18.400]  Thanks to all my friends who deal with all of my endless and ridiculous technical questions.
[23:18.400 --> 23:23.800]  We do have good relationships because I answer all of your weed questions freely, but sometimes I feel like I'm annoying.
[23:23.800 --> 23:28.800]  I feel like I'm a pain in the ass when I've got a thousand technical questions when I'm shopping to buy equipment.
[23:28.800 --> 23:35.200]  I ask everybody too many questions Google is my friend, but my friends with experience are also very knowledgeable.
[23:35.300 --> 23:36.900]  Shout out to my web guys.
[23:36.900 --> 23:39.400]  Shout out to Ben who keeps the website updated.

[24:12.200 --> 24:14.600]  You make the show better with all of those little details.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.500]  I couldn't do this by myself.
[24:15.500 --> 24:17.200]  I say it's a one-man show.
[24:17.200 --> 24:20.800]  I say I do this by myself, but honestly the army keeps me going.
[24:20.800 --> 24:21.600]  You guys help out a lot.
[24:21.600 --> 24:27.400]  So big thanks to the entire I re army the whole grow from your heart podcast crew without you guys.
[24:27.400 --> 24:28.800]  I keep saying this without you.
[24:28.800 --> 24:30.400]  I look like a fucking psychopath.
[24:30.500 --> 24:39.000]  If there wasn't somebody watching this video listening to this audio feed and clicking like and interacting with me if I just did this twice a week just for fun.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.100]  I may need a doctor may need different medication.
[24:43.100 --> 24:52.100]  So thank you guys you validate my my vision you show me that my guidance and that my advice and that my efforts actually have results you send me pictures of your garden.
[24:52.100 --> 24:52.600]  You send me.
[24:52.600 --> 24:53.600]  Thanks and you say dude.
[24:53.600 --> 24:56.800]  I did what you said you rescued my grow.
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.400]  So thank you.
[24:57.400 --> 24:58.600]  Thank you for the trust.
[24:58.600 --> 24:59.600]  Thank you for the respect.
[24:59.600 --> 25:01.100]  Thank you for the support.
[25:01.100 --> 25:02.100]  Thank you for the honesty.
[25:02.100 --> 25:04.400]  You guys are completely honest with me when a show sucks.
[25:04.400 --> 25:06.200]  You guys tell me when a show is great.
[25:06.200 --> 25:08.900]  You guys tell me thank you for that.
[25:08.900 --> 25:12.000]  So I just want to say thank you guys.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.100]  It's been fucking seven years of podcasting.
[25:15.100 --> 25:15.900]  So thank you.
[25:15.900 --> 25:17.000]  Thanks for all the support.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.600]  Thank you for sticking with me.
[25:18.600 --> 25:21.200]  Keep sticking with me.
[25:21.200 --> 25:22.200]  I need to send a special.
[25:22.200 --> 25:24.500]  Thank you to all of the patreon supporters.
[25:24.500 --> 25:27.600]  It was a struggle to get 200 patreon supporters.
[25:27.600 --> 25:30.600]  Now we've been hovering just above 200.
[25:30.600 --> 25:33.400]  We stay about 205 210 patreon supporters.
[25:33.400 --> 25:34.200]  Thank you.
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.300]  That is hard to do as a solitary podcaster.
[25:37.300 --> 25:38.300]  That is a challenge.
[25:38.300 --> 25:39.100]  Thank you guys.
[25:39.100 --> 25:42.300]  I truly truly appreciate that stick around.
[25:42.300 --> 25:44.800]  I'm getting better at podcasting.
[25:44.800 --> 25:46.300]  I'm getting better at growing.
[25:46.300 --> 25:48.900]  I'm learning more about growing all the time.
[25:48.900 --> 25:52.100]  I'm reading more about plants about the plant cycles.
[25:52.100 --> 25:53.800]  I learn more about commercial growing.
[25:53.800 --> 25:55.700]  There's always more stuff to learn.
[25:55.700 --> 25:57.300]  I'm not going to stop learning.
[25:57.300 --> 26:01.200]  I love advancing my knowledge so that I can keep sharing it with you guys.
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.800]  So stick with me for another seven, maybe ten more years.
[26:04.800 --> 26:06.000]  Let's just keep doing the shit.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.300]  There's no end in sight.
[26:07.300 --> 26:09.200]  I don't see a reason to stop.
[26:09.200 --> 26:10.600]  So I'm learning more about growing.
[26:10.600 --> 26:12.200]  I'm learning more about the gear.
[26:12.200 --> 26:13.900]  I'm getting more comfortable with the equipment.
[26:13.900 --> 26:15.700]  I'm getting much better at editing.
[26:15.700 --> 26:19.200]  There will be more cameras more microphones in the future.
[26:19.200 --> 26:20.600]  Cove it is going away.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.800]  I don't know if it's going away or whatever restrictions are easing.
[26:23.800 --> 26:24.800]  There's a vaccine.
[26:24.800 --> 26:27.200]  We're able to play with our friends again pretty soon.
[26:27.200 --> 26:29.700]  There will be people here at the podcast table.
[26:29.700 --> 26:31.700]  There will be more options for the show coming up.
[26:31.700 --> 26:35.400]  There will be more visual aids stick around you guys.
[26:35.400 --> 26:37.000]  I'm excited.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.500]  I feel like I skipped a note.
[26:39.500 --> 26:42.500]  Oh, no, it's still down there on the bottom cool.
[26:42.500 --> 26:45.600]  I'm going to have more guests more zoom stuff coming up.
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.000]  I did notice that when I record on zoom my video comes out super grainy.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.900]  I think I've resolved that issue.
[26:50.900 --> 26:53.100]  I talked about that in a previous episode.
[26:53.100 --> 26:56.000]  I'm still learning you guys just like you're learning to grow.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  I'm learning this stuff.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.800]  So be patient stick with it.
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.000]  I don't want to make any promises, but I'm going to need to do that third episode.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.800]  Maybe every other week or something.
[27:06.800 --> 27:14.400]  Maybe do a bonus one or two extra episodes every month because I can't fit in all of the questions from patreon and all the patreon shoutouts.
[27:14.400 --> 27:21.700]  So if things keep going well, if we stay above 200 patrons things go like they are I'm going to have to do that third episode.
[27:21.700 --> 27:22.900]  I owe it to you.
[27:22.900 --> 27:25.300]  So thank you for that.
[27:25.300 --> 27:27.300]  I had a couple of things in the way of my time.
[27:27.300 --> 27:29.300]  I'm getting better at time management.
[27:29.300 --> 27:33.800]  I had a health concern that turned out to be a false alarm.
[27:33.800 --> 27:35.100]  So that is out of the way.
[27:35.100 --> 27:36.100]  That's a little bit of stress.
[27:36.100 --> 27:40.000]  I don't have to worry about that helps me focus a little bit more on the podcasting.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.200]  Also, I don't have to go to the doctor and figure out what the fuck is going on.
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.400]  I'm going to live you guys and there's honestly nothing fucking wrong with me.
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.800]  I'm an old man that was paranoid.
[27:47.800 --> 27:49.800]  So that was nice to fucking find out.
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.200]  Anyway, I'll be able to get more podcasting going.
[27:52.200 --> 28:03.800]  I'll be bringing you better content more focused grow lessons deeper more in-depth grow knowledge more visual aids more visual learning things are going to get better.
[28:03.800 --> 28:06.000]  I promise you I owe it to you.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.800]  You deserve it for all of the support which you have given me.
[28:08.800 --> 28:09.900]  So thank you guys.
[28:09.900 --> 28:11.300]  I do appreciate it.
[28:11.300 --> 28:13.300]  Happy birthday to the podcast.

[28:58.600 --> 29:01.500]  It's going to take me a minute to get comfortable going to the events.
[29:01.500 --> 29:06.700]  I want people to get out and go to events in public and learn how to fucking act in public again.
[29:06.700 --> 29:08.500]  Some of you guys haven't been out for a while.
[29:08.500 --> 29:11.500]  You may have forgotten some of the common courtesies.
