[00:26.490 --> 00:30.970]  Yeah, what's up everybody? It's time for another episode of the I Grow Culture Podcast, your
[00:30.970 --> 00:36.530]  source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. Welcome to episode number 46. I'm your host,
[00:36.530 --> 00:40.770]  Rasta Jeff, and I'm coming to you this week with a solo episode. It's the day after Christmas
[00:40.770 --> 00:44.250]  and all my friends are hanging out with their families, so I put together a quick show this
[00:44.250 --> 00:48.850]  week and I'll probably do a short episode next week also. I hope everybody had a wonderful
[00:48.850 --> 00:53.690]  holiday. Whichever holiday you choose to celebrate, I hope it was wonderful for you. I owe a huge
[00:53.690 --> 00:57.930]  thank you to my mom for an amazing Christmas gift. I cannot believe what my mom put together
[00:57.930 --> 01:03.170]  for me. Big thanks, mom. And also a big thanks to my queen. Thanks a lot, Angela. You made
[01:03.170 --> 01:07.770]  Christmas awesome. I'm glad you spent that with my family and I. You're family now. Also,
[01:07.770 --> 01:11.130]  I owe a big Christmas shout out to the Garden of Weden. Thanks for letting me be a part
[01:11.130 --> 01:13.850]  of your secret Santa. That was really cool. I felt blessed to be there. That was a good
[01:13.850 --> 01:18.810]  time. I think I'm still dabbed out from the dab gauntlet we did. And I'm wearing the socks
[01:18.810 --> 01:24.050]  that I scored at the secret Santa exchange right now. I got my Huff socks on and my feet
[01:24.050 --> 01:28.210]  are nice and warm. And it's a cold ass night here in Colorado. Holy shit, it's snowing
[01:28.210 --> 01:32.010]  out. It's windy as shit. So these socks came in perfectly. Thank you guys. If you're in
[01:32.010 --> 01:37.770]  Colorado, I hope you're warm. Next week is a, it's New Year's Eve actually. So I will
[01:37.770 --> 01:41.450]  be at the String Cheese Incident concerts in Broomfield, Colorado with my lady. We're
[01:41.450 --> 01:44.810]  taking a little mini vacation. So next week and this week will be kind of easy shows without
[01:44.810 --> 01:48.450]  a ton of info. But I do promise you guys that I'll get back to the original format with
[01:48.450 --> 01:52.490]  tons of info and great guests at the start of the year. The holidays got everybody in
[01:52.490 --> 01:57.370]  chaos. Everybody is, we're all growers and we all have jobs and families. So most of
[01:57.370 --> 02:00.210]  the guys just decided to hang out and not do a show with me this week, which is cool.
[02:00.210 --> 02:03.090]  I don't, I don't blame them. I hope you guys are having fun. Big shout out to everybody
[02:03.090 --> 02:06.610]  who has been on the show, who's taken some time out of their life to come put in an hour,
[02:06.610 --> 02:10.050]  an hour and a half with the agro culture podcast. That's pretty cool. I appreciate it. The listeners
[02:10.050 --> 02:14.690]  love you guys. So I got a few people to thank and a few things to remind you guys of. But
[02:15.010 --> 02:19.690]  we get into too much of that part, let's pay the bills. Let's start with nature's green
[02:19.690 --> 02:25.290]  remedies. This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at nature's green remedies.com

[03:13.930 --> 03:19.410]  Check out the Denver store at 6271. Beach Street or the Pueblo location on 618. East
[03:19.410 --> 03:24.010]  Fourth Street in Pueblo, Colorado. Guys, if you go to the Fourth Street location in Pueblo,
[03:24.010 --> 03:28.970]  there's no parking. Take a right right at the corner. There's a taco place right there
[03:28.970 --> 03:32.370]  and then turn into the alley kind of area and that first door is actually hydro. There's
[03:32.370 --> 03:36.170]  parking in the back go park back there. It's a lot easier to carry your stuff out of the
[03:36.170 --> 03:40.050]  back also. So check out hydro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor growth
[03:40.050 --> 03:44.490]  supplies. Don't forget that hydro runs a special for the podcast listeners. When you check
[03:44.490 --> 03:49.150]  out hydro, tell them you listen to the hydro culture podcast and they will give you commercial
[03:49.150 --> 03:54.210]  pricing on your entire purchase. Because they had a whole bunch of advanced nutrients stuff
[03:54.210 --> 03:57.610]  at the Pueblo location and they're dying to get rid of it. If you went in there and made
[03:57.610 --> 04:01.790]  them an offer on a bunch of advanced nutrients products, I bet burn and Jesse would hook
[04:01.790 --> 04:05.370]  you up. Tell them I listened to the hydro culture podcast. Jeff said to come in here
[04:05.370 --> 04:09.370]  and get these nutrients and they'll give you a deal. So this podcast is also brought
[04:09.370 --> 04:14.930]  to you by our good friends at tree thugger.com tree thugger.com live music lifestyle magazine.

[04:21.370 --> 04:26.370]  All right, much respect to all the sponsors for making the show possible. Big shout out
[04:26.370 --> 04:29.730]  to the mystic roots band that song that just played was from the mystic roots band. They
[04:29.730 --> 04:33.370]  let me play all of their music on the show. So every episode I try to give them a shout
[04:33.370 --> 04:38.450]  out mystic roots band. They're awesome. They're so Cal reggae kind of funk reggae. They got
[04:38.450 --> 04:42.010]  a lot of cool stuff going on. They're probably going to play in your neighborhood sometime
[04:42.010 --> 04:46.690]  soon those kids travel around. Actually they are in Europe right now. The last pictures
[04:46.690 --> 04:51.490]  I saw they were in Italy. Man, it's good to see the mystic roots band in Italy. I think
[04:51.490 --> 04:54.710]  they're just out having fun. I don't know if they're playing but all the pictures I've
[04:54.710 --> 04:58.250]  seen is just them on vacation and that is well deserved guys. I hope you guys are having
[04:58.250 --> 05:03.090]  a great vacation. Shout out to cat and coot in the mystic roots band. Check them out.
[05:03.090 --> 05:07.970]  They're great. Let's see. Got a bunch of comments and stuff to read. What do I want
[05:07.970 --> 05:12.010]  to do first? Oh, let's smack the microphone with the papers. I'm sorry guys. I might have
[05:12.010 --> 05:15.970]  taken a bunch of dabs tonight. So I want to remind you guys that we're going to change
[05:15.970 --> 05:21.290]  the name of the podcast. The show is not going to be the agro culture podcast for much longer.
[05:21.290 --> 05:25.970]  It will be called the grow from your heart podcast. Like I've said before, there's an
[05:25.970 --> 05:31.250]  agricultural educational entity that has the moniker I grow taken. And also I was told
[05:31.250 --> 05:36.170]  that iTunes doesn't appreciate people ripping off the eye. So we're just going to be respectful.
[05:36.170 --> 05:38.610]  We're going to change it to grow from your heart because that's what this is all about.
[05:38.610 --> 05:42.650]  I've always said grow from your heart. If you grow your herb, your cannabis, your medicine
[05:42.650 --> 05:46.850]  from your heart, you will produce better cannabis. If you don't grow your cannabis from your
[05:46.850 --> 05:52.250]  wallet or your ego or your camera. I know I take a lot of pictures, but I grow dank
[05:52.250 --> 05:55.450]  herb because I grow from my heart. That's why I'm able to take the dank pictures. I'm
[05:55.450 --> 06:00.210]  not thinking about my wallet. I'm not thinking about the harvest weight. I pay attention
[06:00.210 --> 06:04.410]  to that stuff. But when I'm in the grow room, I'm thinking about what's going to happen
[06:04.410 --> 06:10.770]  after I grow this herb properly, after I flush it, after I chop it down, after I trim it,
[06:10.770 --> 06:15.210]  after I cure it, after I give it to my patients that smoke this cannabis. I've got an older
[06:15.210 --> 06:18.610]  friend as initials are DC. I don't really want to call him out on the show, but he's
[06:18.610 --> 06:23.430]  who I think of when I think of medical cannabis. He's a good friend of mine and I'm his caregiver.
[06:23.430 --> 06:29.810]  When I see him consume the herb that I put my love into, I can see him get something
[06:29.810 --> 06:34.610]  inside of him feels better. It's not just a physical thing. It's not just him getting
[06:34.610 --> 06:38.550]  high. There's an emotional thing that happens to that guy when my medicine makes him feel
[06:38.550 --> 06:43.490]  better. That emotional thing happens back to me and it fulfills my heart. I grow from
[06:43.490 --> 06:49.010]  my heart. You should grow from your heart as well. I think it'll improve your outlook
[06:49.010 --> 06:54.130]  on your weed. It'll improve your cannabis overall. It'll improve your relationship with
[06:54.130 --> 06:57.410]  your patients. It'll just make things a lot better. Grow from your heart. Quit growing
[06:57.410 --> 07:00.930]  from your wallet. Quit growing from the scale. Quit growing from your camera. Quit growing
[07:00.930 --> 07:03.970]  from your ego and grow from your heart. The Grow From Your Heart podcast, that's our new
[07:03.970 --> 07:10.290]  motto. Grow from your heart. Coming with a new name requires a new logo. I can't change
[07:10.290 --> 07:13.770]  the name until I have a sweet ass new logo. If any of you artists out there would like
[07:13.770 --> 07:20.650]  to throw me down a Grow From Your Heart podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff Logo, I would appreciate
[07:20.650 --> 07:24.710]  it. I don't have a lot of money to tell you the truth, but I would compensate you in some
[07:24.710 --> 07:28.690]  way that made you happy. It may take time. It may take payments. It may take multiple
[07:28.690 --> 07:33.770]  gifts over time. We will work something out because I like to pay back my community that
[07:33.770 --> 07:39.250]  helps me out and you like to help your community out. Do me a favor. Make me a logo. I have
[07:39.250 --> 07:43.450]  this vision. Jesse said it actually. It's a seed. If you've ever grown pot, when you
[07:43.450 --> 07:47.670]  germinate seeds, they crack open and the taproot comes out of there. When that cracks open,
[07:47.670 --> 07:52.190]  it makes the shape of a heart. If you could make that into a heart with the little thing
[07:52.190 --> 07:55.650]  coming out of it, but then make that taproot actually turning into maybe, I don't know.
[07:55.650 --> 07:59.670]  You can get creative, but I want to see that heart coming out or just whatever with the
[07:59.670 --> 08:03.590]  heart in it or grow from your heart. Of course, I like red, yellow, and green. I'm a Rastafarian.
[08:03.590 --> 08:08.110]  If you do that, I've never said this on a podcast. If you're going to make a Rastafarian
[08:08.110 --> 08:12.390]  themed logo, the red goes on the bottom, you guys. It's red, gold, and green. Yes, red,
[08:12.390 --> 08:17.370]  yellow, green, but the red is on the bottom. It's actually green, yellow, red. Do that
[08:17.370 --> 08:20.650]  properly if you're going to make me a logo because I'm a Rasta and I want it right because
[08:20.650 --> 08:23.890]  it's almost disrespectful to put your logo with the colors upside down if you're bringing
[08:23.890 --> 08:27.330]  it in a Rasta way. I'm not going to bitch about it. I'm just saying, do it the right
[08:27.330 --> 08:31.050]  way. If you're a real Rasta, you'll understand why. You want it the right way. It's like
[08:31.050 --> 08:34.410]  if I put the American flag upside down, it would piss a lot of Americans off. Just imagine
[08:34.410 --> 08:37.890]  you people getting the Rasta flag backwards. It frustrates some people. I don't give too
[08:37.890 --> 08:41.010]  much of a shit about it. I'm just letting you know that you're doing it wrong.
[08:41.010 --> 08:46.330]  Yeah, also, we need a new theme song. I've been playing the Mystic Roots band. It sounds
[08:46.330 --> 08:50.170]  awesome, but wouldn't it be a lot cooler if I had a customized theme song that was something
[08:50.170 --> 08:53.770]  about grow from your heart? I don't even know how it would go, but maybe some dance
[08:53.770 --> 08:59.370]  hall reggae or something. Grow from your heart. I don't know. That's your job, not mine. If
[08:59.370 --> 09:02.650]  somebody's got a song for me, I got the same deal for you as I do the logo. Some kind of
[09:02.650 --> 09:06.210]  kick down. If you're in Colorado, I'll hand you packs of seeds. You'll get Iri genetic
[09:06.210 --> 09:13.130]  seeds, feminized or regular or both. We'll work something out. I'll give you a t-shirt.
[09:13.130 --> 09:16.130]  I'm going to get more hoodies made. More of the Iri genetics hoodies are being planned
[09:16.130 --> 09:20.890]  out. Shout out to Handmade Apparel. We're negotiating. Had to kind of hesitate a little
[09:20.890 --> 09:23.490]  bit. I'm going to do it at the start of the year just for tax purposes, and then we'll
[09:23.490 --> 09:27.290]  get some more hoodies. Maybe you'll get a hoodie out of the deal. I'm begging. I'm just
[09:27.290 --> 09:31.650]  asking for a new logo and a new theme song for the Grow from Your Heart podcast because
[09:31.650 --> 09:35.530]  I'm too busy putting together shows and growing gardens and teaching people how to grow herb
[09:35.530 --> 09:40.050]  to actually be able to make a new logo. I don't really have good art skills. If you
[09:40.050 --> 09:44.890]  do that, I'd appreciate it. Let's see. What's the next part? I've been getting a ton of
[09:44.890 --> 09:49.010]  emails, dude. Holy crap. I've been getting so many emails, tweets and Facebook messages
[09:49.010 --> 09:53.450]  about the podcast. It's overwhelming in such a good way. I want to thank everybody for
[09:53.450 --> 09:57.370]  messaging me. The huge response I've gotten the last few episodes has really inspired
[09:57.370 --> 10:01.090]  me to push the show to the next level. I've been putting more time into the shows and
[10:01.090 --> 10:05.450]  doing more research because I want to keep bringing the best show that I can. Every time
[10:05.450 --> 10:09.610]  you guys message me, that makes me want to try a little bit harder. I just want to step
[10:09.610 --> 10:15.490]  it up. Let's see. I've got a couple of tweets that I saved here. I've got them in my phone,
[10:15.490 --> 10:17.890]  so I've got to search through the phone. I know I just said I want to bring you guys
[10:17.890 --> 10:22.010]  better shows. I bring you a half-ass New Year's Eve show. I don't have any guests or anything.
[10:22.010 --> 10:25.330]  I thought I'd have people here, so I don't have a lot planned, but I'm going to make
[10:25.330 --> 10:30.770]  it dope for you. Let's see. Big shout out to Party McFly. He says, Rasta Jeff, bro.
[10:30.770 --> 10:34.610]  Oh, yeah. You can tweet me at the I Grow Culture or I Grow. It's at I Grow Culture, or you
[10:34.610 --> 10:38.290]  can also tweet me. It's at Rasta Jeff 420 if you just want to hit me directly. I check
[10:38.290 --> 10:42.410]  them both quite frequently, like once a day probably. This dude says, bro, I love the
[10:42.410 --> 10:46.170]  podcast. It's the first podcast I've been into. I'm going to have to start from the
[10:46.170 --> 10:51.490]  beginning and catch up. Okay. I'm embarrassed that you're going to do that because honestly,
[10:51.490 --> 10:57.450]  well, let me not say I'm embarrassed. I guess I'm proud now. The first 25 episodes or so,
[10:57.450 --> 11:02.650]  I didn't know what I was doing. I turned on the microphone and just blurted out a bunch
[11:02.650 --> 11:06.090]  of shit and whatever came out of my face is how the show went. Then I started making too
[11:06.090 --> 11:09.850]  many notes and it got a little weird, but I feel like I'm comfortable with the microphone
[11:09.850 --> 11:14.770]  now. I just turn it on. I make a few bullet points and start going and it all comes out.
[11:14.770 --> 11:19.690]  I'm not so hypercritical of it now. Dude, Party McFly and the way you wrote your Twitter
[11:19.690 --> 11:25.130]  handle is pretty cool. I can't even ... I don't know how you did that, but it's at Frivolous,
[11:25.130 --> 11:30.810]  F-R-I-V-O-L-A-S if you want to follow Party McFly. Dude, thanks for the tweet. I hope you
[11:30.810 --> 11:35.130]  listen to every single episode. If you want to listen to them all, they're on iTunes.
[11:35.130 --> 11:39.770]  I think the last 10 are on Stitcher, but every single episode all the way from the
[11:39.770 --> 11:46.330]  beginning all the way up to whatever episode you're on will always be on the iRegeneticsColorado.com
[11:46.330 --> 11:50.010]  website. I'm going to have to change the tab on there. We're going to do a lot of changing,
[11:50.010 --> 11:54.370]  you guys. Don't get lost. It's still going to be in the same feed. If you're listening
[11:54.370 --> 11:57.490]  on iTunes or Stitcher or whatever, the feed will still be the same. If you're coming to
[11:57.490 --> 12:01.850]  the website, it'll still be easy to find. Don't lose me when I change my name. I just
[12:01.850 --> 12:07.210]  have to do it. It's going to be super easy, I hope. I'm rambling. I took a bunch of dabs,
[12:07.210 --> 12:13.610]  a lot of dabs. I made these dabs even. Party McFly, thanks for messaging me on Twitter.
[12:13.610 --> 12:19.230]  My next tweet came from Road Runner. It's at Road underscore Runner 420. He said, listening
[12:19.230 --> 12:24.450]  from the UK, still underground here, but great to see you guys leading the way for us. Great
[12:24.450 --> 12:28.810]  show. Keep it up. Dude, thanks a lot. Those words of encouragement mean a lot to me, like
[12:28.810 --> 12:32.650]  I was saying. Everybody wants to hear that they're doing right. Sometimes you just put
[12:32.650 --> 12:35.770]  in a bunch of work and nobody says anything and you're like, ah, but you guys have been
[12:35.770 --> 12:41.530]  making me feel like I'm killing it. Awesome. Thank you. We've gotten 6,500 listens on some
[12:41.530 --> 12:47.210]  episodes. The episode with King Cola is probably going to hit 10,000 episodes eventually. That
[12:47.210 --> 12:51.730]  will be the first one to do it, which is remarkable because it's a newer episode and there's been
[12:51.730 --> 12:56.490]  a lot of time on other shows and they haven't been listened to nearly as much as the episodes
[12:56.490 --> 13:00.810]  with King Cola. So shout out to King Cola. And episode 35 with drying and curing also
[13:00.810 --> 13:05.890]  has been a huge success. If you guys haven't listened to that one, it's time. Go back and
[13:05.890 --> 13:10.810]  listen to number 35. If I had a recommendation for you, 35 and then the ones with King Cola,
[13:10.810 --> 13:15.330]  I don't remember the numbers. I could pause and look. Hold on. All right. I went back
[13:15.330 --> 13:21.930]  and checked. I honestly think that from 35 on is where if 35 through 45 are some of our
[13:21.930 --> 13:27.210]  best episodes ever, there are a couple in there. 44 is random chatter because we got
[13:27.210 --> 13:32.570]  chatty and then 41 is chatty stoners. But for the most part, the 35 through 45 are some
[13:32.570 --> 13:39.730]  of my favorite, most proud episodes. 45 more about organics with King Cola, 43 intro to
[13:39.730 --> 13:44.650]  organics with King Cola. Those are some great episodes. Number 42 intro to NPK. That got
[13:44.650 --> 13:50.490]  a lot of response. The episodes about building your grow 39 and 40. Those really crushed
[13:50.490 --> 13:55.730]  it. 37 was planning your grow space. That did a lot. And 35 drying and curing definitely
[13:55.730 --> 14:00.130]  has been listened to a whole bunch. So thanks a lot guys for listening to those. It's good
[14:00.130 --> 14:03.930]  to know that you're paying attention and liking it. I'm so rambly today. I'm glad I turned
[14:03.930 --> 14:07.570]  on the microphone. Guys take a dab. I'm going to take a dab right quick. I've got some dabs
[14:07.570 --> 14:13.490]  sitting here. This is a mix of stuff that I recently grew. My homie Spence taught me
[14:13.490 --> 14:17.570]  how to make this hash. I usually wasn't making it. I was letting other people do it, but
[14:17.570 --> 14:22.610]  why not be self-sufficient, right? This is a white widow, a girl scout cookies. No, there's
[14:22.610 --> 14:29.050]  no cookies in here. It's white widow, golden goat flow, ghost OG. There's gorilla glue
[14:29.050 --> 14:35.010]  number four in here. Um, there's some lemon Jeffrey in here. There's lemon skunk. So this
[14:35.010 --> 14:39.050]  is quite a nice mix. I'm going to take a big fat dad. You guys take a dab with me, please.
[14:39.050 --> 14:52.090]  I want to give a big shout out to giddy up and emo tech. I'm hitting this G nail. I've
[14:52.730 --> 14:57.090]  had it turned on for about a month now. I haven't turned it off. I don't think, Oh,
[14:57.090 --> 15:01.090]  that was a big dab. Wow. And this G nail has not given me any trouble. It's been awesome.
[15:01.090 --> 15:05.090]  I love it. It's got a USB port on the front that'll charge up your phone. So you can plug
[15:05.090 --> 15:09.410]  in if you've only got a limited spot of plugs, you can plug in your email or the G nail,
[15:09.410 --> 15:13.010]  and then you can plug in your iPhone into that and charge your phone while you're taking
[15:13.010 --> 15:18.330]  hot dabs. It's amazing. I like it. So shout out to giddy up. Thanks a lot, bro. That was
[15:18.330 --> 15:23.050]  a good gift came right before Christmas. All right, let's see. I did the tweets. I
[15:23.050 --> 15:26.570]  want to thank Jake and Emily. Wow. I just yelled into the microphone. I'm sorry. I hope
[15:26.570 --> 15:30.370]  the software fixes that. I want to thank Jake and Emily for the emails they sent. I will
[15:30.370 --> 15:33.650]  be in touch very soon. You guys haven't responded to a bunch of emails. It's been the holidays
[15:33.650 --> 15:39.530]  been a little overwhelmed. I'll get back to you. I promise. But I'm interested. You guys
[15:39.530 --> 15:43.250]  said some things and I'm interested. I'm paying attention. Also, I want to give a big thanks
[15:43.250 --> 15:50.730]  to G 35. Don't even ask guys. That's his name. He can be G 35 if he wants. Brent M.
[15:50.730 --> 15:55.970]  And also Fred Garvin. I want to thank you guys for all your interaction messages, tweets,
[15:55.970 --> 16:01.250]  emails, Facebook's all of the above. I appreciate the emails guys. So keep them coming. Send
[16:01.250 --> 16:05.930]  them to I grow culture at hotmail.com. Shit. I'm gonna have to change that too. We're gonna
[16:05.930 --> 16:09.810]  make another email address since we're changing everything. I can just keep that and I'll
[16:09.810 --> 16:14.010]  forward it but we'll make up another one. Episode 50 is coming up guys and I'm planning
[16:14.010 --> 16:18.610]  a small celebration episode. I'm going to try to get as many microphones as I have.
[16:18.610 --> 16:22.930]  I'm going to try to get that many people my software or my setup here. I could probably
[16:22.930 --> 16:28.610]  put in 20 microphones with all the inputs and other in lines I've got but I don't really
[16:28.610 --> 16:33.450]  you know, we'll try to get we'll get Adam and Jesse and maybe Spence. Hey Maddie, you're
[16:33.450 --> 16:36.450]  invited. I'd like to have Maddie on the show. It'd be great to have the first chick on the
[16:36.450 --> 16:40.210]  show. Be you. I'm sorry. The first woman. I won't say chick. That's sexist. We'll have
[16:40.210 --> 16:44.650]  the first woman on the show. Be Maddie. Try to correct myself there. I'd like you guys's
[16:44.650 --> 16:48.530]  input about episode number 50. I've got a few questions for you. So if you want to email
[16:48.530 --> 16:52.850]  me or tweet me, now's a good time. I want to know what were some of your favorite moments
[16:52.850 --> 16:58.250]  on the podcast so far? What stood out to you if there's an episode or a moment that stood
[16:58.250 --> 17:03.330]  out tweet me and tell me what it was. I want to celebrate that on episode 50. What did
[17:03.330 --> 17:07.130]  you guys learn? Is there something that you learned that really stood out that really
[17:07.130 --> 17:10.410]  like if you ever heard somebody say one thing and you're like, Oh my God, I've been listening
[17:10.410 --> 17:14.810]  to this guy ramble for a whole hour and that's the one thing that made it worth it. If you
[17:14.810 --> 17:18.810]  got one thing that you learned or something that really stood out, let me know. I want
[17:18.810 --> 17:23.890]  to know what you guys learned from me or us. Also, who's your favorite guest on my podcast?
[17:23.890 --> 17:30.770]  I've had a lot of people on Spence, Jesse, Mike, Adam, King Cola, Addison Damora was
[17:30.770 --> 17:34.770]  on the show via interview. That was one of my most proud because that was my second episode
[17:34.770 --> 17:37.770]  and I called up Addison like I had a podcast going on. I didn't know what the hell I was
[17:37.770 --> 17:42.450]  doing. It was kind of funny of me to do. I should try that again and see how it goes.
[17:42.450 --> 17:46.910]  Also I want to know what would you guys like to hear next? I talk a lot and why not make
[17:46.910 --> 17:51.650]  it be about something that you guys actually want to hear? You know, cause if I'm just
[17:51.650 --> 17:54.450]  going to talk, you can tell me what you want me to say instead of me just rambling and
[17:54.450 --> 17:59.250]  rambling and rambling. All right, so send me some input. You guys, it's I grow culture
[17:59.250 --> 18:05.450]  at hotmail.com. You can tweet me at I grow culture or you can find me on Facebook. Um,
[18:05.450 --> 18:09.010]  send me a message there. Just search for I grow culture. I've got a personal Facebook.
[18:09.010 --> 18:13.410]  If you guys find that, uh, I don't accept every friend request right away. I kinda,
[18:13.410 --> 18:16.330]  I'll troll you a little bit and see who you are before I approve your stuff. Cause I'm
[18:16.330 --> 18:20.330]  getting, if Facebook's getting weird, I'm sorry. Uh, I don't, I don't want to be that
[18:20.330 --> 18:24.690]  open anymore. If you want to see, I'm completely open with the IRI genetic stuff and the I
[18:24.690 --> 18:29.930]  grow culture stuff. All of that is fair game. I tweet, uh, I Instagram dude, my IRI genetics
[18:29.930 --> 18:35.290]  Instagram blows up and I'm going to brag a little bit. My mom spoiled the shit out of
[18:35.290 --> 18:40.170]  me for Christmas. She knows that I've been looking at this Nikon camera and so on Christmas,
[18:40.170 --> 18:45.010]  uh, the gifts were all done and then she slid this other box toward me and just smiled and
[18:45.010 --> 18:48.250]  had a tear in her eye. And when I opened it, I kind of got a tear in my eye also cause
[18:48.250 --> 18:53.210]  she hooked me up with the Nikon D 32, uh, the D 3200, the package with the extra lens
[18:53.210 --> 18:59.410]  in the bag and shit. And uh, I've been eyeballing that thing for quite a while. So thanks mom.
[18:59.410 --> 19:02.210]  Again, that's why I shouted her out at the start of the show, but Holy shit, dude, that's
[19:02.210 --> 19:06.650]  the one of the best gifts I've ever gotten. Uh, not to discredit any other gifts, but
[19:06.650 --> 19:10.290]  I mean, Holy crap, that's the camera I've been eyeballing for months and mom's bought
[19:10.290 --> 19:14.410]  it for me. So thanks again, mom. Uh, that means that my Instagram is going to improve.
[19:14.410 --> 19:17.690]  Uh, you're going to see better pictures. You're going to see more angles. You're going to
[19:17.690 --> 19:21.170]  see more zoom. You're going to see better, better, better just cause I've got better
[19:21.170 --> 19:25.610]  gear. I've been shooting those Instagram shots. You see, if you follow me on IgE, those
[19:25.610 --> 19:32.330]  shots come from a Panasonic Lumix point and shoot camera. It was $199 at Best Buy and
[19:32.330 --> 19:36.650]  that's what I'm pulling off. So now that I've upgraded to this freaking badass camera, I
[19:36.650 --> 19:39.970]  think you'll see some improvement. All right. I've been rambling about that. Holy crap.
[19:39.970 --> 19:43.730]  But follow me on Instagram if you want to. It's I grow culture or I read genetics. I've
[19:43.730 --> 19:47.410]  got them both. I post a lot of stuff on I read genetics. I post about every three hours.
[19:47.410 --> 19:52.170]  I try just to keep it moving. Holy crap guys. I'm dabbed out and I feel like I'm talking
[19:52.170 --> 19:56.570]  really, really quickly. Let's take a big yoga breath together and slow down a little bit.
[19:56.570 --> 20:03.170]  Yeah, that's the sound of me calming down. I do that shit sometimes I need to calm down
[20:03.170 --> 20:08.630]  for this part. Uh, this is important. Uh, I've got a friend whose name is Deacon Gray.
[20:08.630 --> 20:14.210]  Deacon Gray is a comedian. Um, he's from Oklahoma, but he currently resides in the great city
[20:14.210 --> 20:18.550]  of Denver, Colorado. If you've gone to a show at comedy works, there's a good chance you've
[20:19.030 --> 20:23.790]  seen Deacon Gray as an opening act. He's a little white haired dude that tells weed jokes.
[20:23.790 --> 20:30.190]  Uh, he talks about being from Oklahoma. He's hilarious in my opinion. Um, Deacon Gray has
[20:30.190 --> 20:36.670]  made me laugh my ass off multiple times. And, uh, recently I'm going to go to this website
[20:36.670 --> 20:38.990]  that I've got here. I got to search through it real quick. Sorry. I'm stumbling because
[20:38.990 --> 20:46.190]  I was trying to be somber about this. Let's see. I got to back up one tab. Do do do doom.
[20:46.190 --> 20:52.030]  So Deacon Gray, uh, this page is called help Deacon Gray grab cancer by the throat. Um,
[20:52.030 --> 20:55.590]  help Deacon Gray grab cancer by the throat. Deacon was living his life and slinging his
[20:55.590 --> 20:59.870]  jokes and doing his duties as a new talent coordinator at comedy works. Everything was
[20:59.870 --> 21:03.990]  hunky Dory except that his friends say hunky Dory when he noticed he had a lump on his
[21:03.990 --> 21:07.910]  neck. Hmm. Better have that looked at. Well, he had it looked at and they wanted to look
[21:07.910 --> 21:13.670]  at it a little closer, like take a tonsil out closer, which they did. The bad news,
[21:13.670 --> 21:17.710]  it's cancer. You guys, the good news, it's a highly curable kind of cancer. The same
[21:17.710 --> 21:23.310]  kind of nuggets coach George Carl beat recently. His prognosis is excellent. His spirits are
[21:23.310 --> 21:29.230]  good, but he's got several weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments to get through. So
[21:29.230 --> 21:31.670]  it's this click more. I'm not going to read all this to you guys. You get the point. What
[21:31.670 --> 21:36.190]  I'm headed for is Deacon. Gray has made me laugh my ass off several times. He's funny
[21:36.190 --> 21:42.710]  as fuck, dude. He tells weed jokes. His delivery is amazing. And in return for making me laugh,
[21:42.750 --> 21:46.750]  I want to shout out his website so that we can raise this guy a little bit of money.
[21:46.750 --> 21:50.070]  He's got throat cancer. We got to get him through it. He can't smoke cannabis right
[21:50.070 --> 21:53.130]  now because he's got throat cancer, but he can definitely eat edibles. He can do stuff
[21:53.130 --> 21:57.350]  like that. So if you live near Deacon Gray and you see him laying edible on him, a good
[21:57.350 --> 22:01.590]  edible, don't give him some bullshit. Give him a good clean quality edible. And then
[22:01.590 --> 22:08.590]  after that, go to give forward.com and search for Deacon Gray. I'm looking for the, my,
[22:08.990 --> 22:13.150]  it just wants to show me, here we go. It's give forward.com slash fundraiser. Oh, there's
[22:13.150 --> 22:17.710]  a whole bunch of stuff. So just go to give forward.com and search for Deacon Gray. It's
[22:17.710 --> 22:24.030]  D E A C O N. And then his last name is great. G R A Y. I truly appreciate it. Uh, you can
[22:24.030 --> 22:29.310]  donate as little as $5. Somebody on here donated. One of the last donations that I saw was a
[22:29.310 --> 22:33.670]  thousand dollars. And I thought that was really generous. I wish I could give somebody a thousand
[22:33.670 --> 22:38.310]  dollars for their cancer treatment and health, but man, I would contribute a little bit to
[22:38.310 --> 22:41.430]  this. I won't disclose how much that's my personal donation, but I will donate to this
[22:41.430 --> 22:44.870]  cause. Uh, as soon as I'm leaving the tab open so that I could do it right after the
[22:44.870 --> 22:48.070]  show here. But I'd appreciate it if you guys just went through a couple of bucks to Deacon
[22:48.070 --> 22:52.630]  Gray. I'm not trying to beg for him. The dude's got throat cancer. He made me laugh. Uh, laughter
[22:52.630 --> 22:56.550]  is medicine. That shit means a lot to me. So I want to give forward and help out Deacon
[22:56.550 --> 23:00.870]  Gray. So once again, I'll read out his website. It's give forward.com and just search for
[23:00.870 --> 23:06.110]  Deacon Gray. He's really close to his goal. He's trying to raise $10,000. He's already
[23:06.110 --> 23:12.670]  got $4,120. He's almost 50% of the way through 39 donations. So he's getting there. That's
[23:12.670 --> 23:16.270]  freaking awesome. Uh, Deacon Gray shout out brother. I hope you get to hear this somehow.
[23:16.270 --> 23:20.390]  I hope somebody relays this to you. Much respect. You made me laugh a lot. This is the least
[23:20.390 --> 23:26.630]  I can do for you. So I want to go and read a news article that kind of hit home for me
[23:26.630 --> 23:30.590]  because uh, well, you'll understand why I'm a seed breeder. I am, I am Rasta Jeff. I do
[23:30.590 --> 23:35.470]  the agriculture podcast, but I'm also the guy that owns iRegenetics. I, I am iRegenetics.
[23:35.470 --> 23:41.270]  I do the breeding. I do the selection. Um, Jesse is actually part of the team now. None
[23:41.270 --> 23:44.510]  of his stuff is available through me yet, but it will be very soon. So Jesse is part
[23:44.510 --> 23:49.430]  of the team. Big shout out to Jesse. Jesse grows, follow him. Um, you'll see his projects
[23:49.430 --> 23:53.550]  coming through, but you'll understand why this hits home. Now this is from the cannabis.
[23:53.550 --> 23:57.750]  The article was written by Jason Blevins. It was from the Denver post originally. It
[23:57.750 --> 24:04.310]  was published December 24th, uh, at 5 0 5 PM. It says pot growers, new quest us patent
[24:04.310 --> 24:09.450]  protection for cannabis seeds. Ben Holmes gently lowers the turntable needle onto the
[24:09.450 --> 24:15.090]  album and traffic's medicated goo begins to play. Steve Wynwood's wistful tenor sweeps
[24:15.090 --> 24:20.310]  through the Centennial seeds laboratory. My own homegrown recipe. You'll see it through.
[24:20.310 --> 24:23.870]  Everyone stole from Steve Wynwood. Home says his foot tapping as he injects a syringe of
[24:23.870 --> 24:29.750]  dark syrupy liquid into his gas chromatograph. No one is stealing from Holmes, a self-taught
[24:29.750 --> 24:34.310]  scientist engineer farmer and cannabis seed geek who next month will take a rare step
[24:34.310 --> 24:39.910]  to apply for a patent on a laboriously created cannabis super strain. If it is awarded the
[24:39.910 --> 24:44.890]  U S patent on Holmes medical grade auto to strain will be the first to protect a cannabis
[24:44.890 --> 24:49.430]  plant and a first step in establishing plant breeder rights for growers who only a few
[24:49.430 --> 24:54.630]  years ago were considered criminals. Now I said the strain is called auto two, uh, it's
[24:54.630 --> 24:59.750]  spelled O T T O and then the Roman numeral two. It's not auto like auto flower. So I
[24:59.750 --> 25:03.190]  just want to clear that up. It's the same word. Essentially I'm saying auto and I would
[25:03.190 --> 25:07.710]  say auto if it were spelled the other way. So if you guys are haters of auto flowers,
[25:07.710 --> 25:11.990]  that's not what it is. It's just auto like a, the dude from the Simpsons. It's probably
[25:11.990 --> 25:17.870]  got a some Canadian influence I would assume. Right? Anyway, this industry came up in stealth
[25:17.870 --> 25:21.550]  born in basements and crawl spaces, Holmes said, but now with companies forming and making
[25:21.550 --> 25:25.670]  larger investments, the desire to protect intellectual property is becoming paramount,
[25:25.670 --> 25:29.950]  bleeding edge stuff right here. And I, this is kind of hits home to me because I breed
[25:29.950 --> 25:35.470]  seeds and I create strains and I see people, um, I don't want to say ripping them off because
[25:35.470 --> 25:38.890]  I don't know if they thought of it before me, if they just happened to post it to Instagram
[25:38.890 --> 25:45.910]  after me, but people, we like to borrow names in this industry for strains. We, uh, we think
[25:45.910 --> 25:48.070]  we're coming up with something original. You guys are going to hear a thumping noise. I'm
[25:48.070 --> 25:51.350]  moving this microphone. It's sliding. Sorry. Here we go. I've got to tighten this up. Tighten
[25:51.350 --> 25:54.590]  up now. Here we go. Sorry if that sounds like shit in the recording, I'm not going to censor
[25:54.590 --> 26:01.310]  that or edit that out at all. So making stuff, my strains get stolen often and I can't complain
[26:01.310 --> 26:05.270]  about it because I'm actually using other people's strains to make mine. Somebody had
[26:05.270 --> 26:09.750]  to make the seeds for me to breed with, but just give credit I guess. But now people are
[26:09.750 --> 26:15.550]  going to be able to patent stuff. So what I'm worried about mainly are people with more
[26:15.550 --> 26:19.950]  money going to punk me and patent my shit and squeeze me right out. Are you going to
[26:19.950 --> 26:24.790]  see other people claiming that they own Capelton? That's what I'm worried about. And I don't,
[26:24.790 --> 26:29.390]  I don't know the legal parts of this enough to know, but I do know that I don't have any
[26:29.390 --> 26:32.870]  money compared to a lot of these people. I am small time compared to a lot of these people
[26:32.870 --> 26:37.950]  compared to greenhouse, compared to the Cali connection, compared to DNA. I am nobody.
[26:37.950 --> 26:41.910]  And those guys could squeeze me out tomorrow if they wanted to. But luckily we're a friendly
[26:41.910 --> 26:46.590]  industry. Big business doesn't give a shit about friendly industry. They'll squeeze us all out by
[26:46.590 --> 26:49.550]  doing this kind of stuff because they've got the money. That's what I fear. But I'm a paranoid
[26:49.550 --> 26:54.430]  hippie. I've been on too many fish parking lots to have a clear head about that kind of shit. I
[26:54.430 --> 26:58.710]  just always think the paranoid part. So let me read more to more of the article. It says,
[26:58.710 --> 27:03.790]  indeed, gone are the days when pie long hairs haphazardly hurled pollen into jungles of pot
[27:03.790 --> 27:10.070]  plants hoping to meld two strains. And that's such a great cliche in one fucking sentence. I love
[27:10.070 --> 27:15.830]  that. Let's see what we got. We got pie eyed long hairs. So you can see those guys pie eyed long
[27:15.830 --> 27:22.070]  hairs all, I'm high and I got big eyes, right? Like a long hair. So a haphazardly hurling pollen.
[27:22.070 --> 27:26.750]  They're just got this male plant and there's beating it into the room in the jungles of pot
[27:26.750 --> 27:32.830]  plants. So no strain selection here. Let's just put a bunch of females in here. Sorry. I'm just
[27:32.830 --> 27:38.030]  talking shit about the sentence. It was great. Hoping to meld two strains. Today's top readers
[27:38.030 --> 27:43.030]  are geneticists taking years to weed through carefully engineered generations of cannabis to
[27:43.030 --> 27:47.150]  elevate the most desired traits. Now that's a pretty accurate statement. I will agree with
[27:47.150 --> 27:52.950]  that. Some of the new super strains are high in cannabidiol or CBD, one of several dozen cannabinoid
[27:52.950 --> 27:58.790]  chemical compounds and cannabis and the plants major non psychoactive ingredient. Oh man, I was
[27:58.790 --> 28:04.350]  proud because he said chemical compound, but then he said ingredient and then that ruined him. I'm
[28:04.350 --> 28:07.910]  so critical of these guys articles and I bet I say some really dumb shit on the podcast because
[28:07.910 --> 28:11.590]  I'm high, but these guys have editors and proofreaders and shit. I'm just here spouting it
[28:11.590 --> 28:18.230]  out. I've taken dabs and drink mate and can't be held accountable for anything I say after that.
[28:18.870 --> 28:24.510]  All right, CBD has been credited with relieving some epileptic seizures, prompting widespread
[28:24.510 --> 28:29.950]  calls for additional research. Other more utilitarian super strains are resistant to mites
[28:29.950 --> 28:35.830]  or the crop killing powdery mildew that plagues grow operations across Colorado. Um, crop killing
[28:35.830 --> 28:39.470]  powdery mildew that plagues grow operations across Colorado. It sounds like we only have that
[28:39.470 --> 28:43.750]  here. They have powdery mildew all over the place, bro. I don't know why you're singling out
[28:43.750 --> 28:48.990]  Colorado. It does happen here. All right, I'll quit ranting about that part. Let's get more into
[28:48.990 --> 28:54.310]  the article here. Oh, where was I? Some super strains are simply super stony with sky high
[28:54.310 --> 29:01.830]  levels of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. I gotta scroll
[29:01.830 --> 29:05.830]  way down. There's like seven ads here. Here we go. The gas chromatograph is Holmes key in
[29:05.830 --> 29:11.590]  shaping auto to a high CBD low THC strain he hopes can feel medical therapies. The 50 year old
[29:11.590 --> 29:16.430]  gizmo separates molecules and converts them into an electrical impulse. A green line tracking
[29:16.430 --> 29:21.510]  across screen reveals the THC level in the substance. That line will be the baseline for a
[29:21.510 --> 29:27.110]  measurement of auto to Holmes produces a well worn label tablet laden with acronyms and
[29:27.110 --> 29:32.030]  millivolt values from the gas chromatograph. Those figures reveal his painstaking progress
[29:32.030 --> 29:38.350]  toward breeding the THC out and the CBD into his treasured varietal. It is in many ways the
[29:38.350 --> 29:42.390]  result of a lifelong career dedicated to breeding, growing, cloning, engineering and
[29:42.390 --> 29:47.670]  charting the most useful cannabis plants. As Wynwood sings the off cover Dear Mr. Fantasy,
[29:47.710 --> 29:52.150]  Holmes shares his plans to protect auto to which ranks among the most valuable of his
[29:52.150 --> 29:57.150]  collection of 400 varieties of cannabis seeds, both marijuana and hemp, most of which are
[29:57.150 --> 30:02.390]  stored in additional freezer in his Lafayette lab. In addition to the patent, he hopes to be
[30:02.390 --> 30:07.510]  the first cannabis breeder to secure protection under the plant variety Protection Act. The
[30:07.510 --> 30:13.230]  Seminole plant breeders rights legislation from 1970. The value of the seed the value of that
[30:13.230 --> 30:18.430]  seed long term could be very, very valuable. And annuity said Holmes, a father of two who
[30:18.430 --> 30:22.950]  serves on the state's industrial hemp advisory committee, and is collaborating on the
[30:22.950 --> 30:27.950]  University of Colorado's groundbreaking cannabis genomic research initiative. And if you guys
[30:27.950 --> 30:33.070]  haven't checked that out, you should. I'll say it again. It's the cannabis genomic research
[30:33.070 --> 30:37.390]  initiative. There's a link to it in this article on the cannabis. So if you can find this article
[30:37.390 --> 30:42.350]  on the cannabis, it's the article about pot growers new quest us patent patent protection.
[30:43.310 --> 30:48.590]  This link is in that article. So everyone who does this wants to produce something with
[30:48.590 --> 30:54.590]  durability, he said, a seed with good utility that produces well, can have longevity for
[30:54.590 --> 31:00.830]  generations, which is very true. I've read a few strains that I can keep those seeds around. And
[31:00.830 --> 31:04.270]  that capelton the bounty killer will be good forever. I'm gonna get back into the article
[31:04.270 --> 31:10.190]  here. That was kind of a random rant. It says, Holmes is sort of a modern day Luther, Luther
[31:10.190 --> 31:14.670]  Burbank, who you should read about guys, the pirate pioneering American botanist and horticulturist
[31:14.670 --> 31:19.710]  who developed more than 800 varieties and strains of plants in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
[31:20.270 --> 31:25.630]  His name is Luther Burbank. If you want to Google him, Wikipedia, that guy, Burbank faced intellectual
[31:25.630 --> 31:30.910]  property challenges in his career as he created still herald peaches, plums, daisies and the world
[31:30.910 --> 31:36.670]  dominant Burbank russet potato. Holmes follows Burbank's lead offering a few types of seeds to
[31:36.670 --> 31:40.670]  a single large distributor who can flood the market in the first year before anyone can take
[31:40.670 --> 31:45.630]  it as their own by cloning the young seedlings. So this guy's idea and that's a good idea.
[31:46.830 --> 31:53.950]  He's gonna put out so many seeds so quickly that everybody will know it's his because it'll be
[31:53.950 --> 31:58.430]  flooded, but nobody will be able to claim it before they can cut a clone because he'll be so well known
[31:58.430 --> 32:02.190]  for putting it out. That's pretty smart. He just puts out so many that they're like, oh, it's got
[32:02.190 --> 32:06.670]  to be him because everyone's got the seeds. Yeah, that makes sense to me. I like that. It's a good
[32:06.670 --> 32:10.750]  idea. I might start hoarding certain strains when I make seeds now, just make a whole bunch of them
[32:10.750 --> 32:14.910]  until I can do that. No, I wouldn't do that. I'm just joking. Sorry, guys. By the time copycats
[32:14.910 --> 32:20.190]  have cloned Holmes's strains, he's already, he already has made his money. He also licenses the
[32:20.190 --> 32:24.990]  use of his heirloom seeds, but not the extra special seeds he doesn't want copied. Really,
[32:24.990 --> 32:29.390]  the focus minus any patent protection is non licensing and careful selection of distributors.
[32:29.390 --> 32:33.950]  Holmes said state trademark protection can safeguard the name of an innovation within a
[32:33.950 --> 32:38.430]  state's borders, but protecting intellectual property through state law is a bandage.
[32:38.430 --> 32:44.190]  Patents are exclusively federal. Marijuana is illegal under federal law and federal law
[32:44.190 --> 32:49.630]  trumps state law. So this guy could get completely denied for his attempt at patenting his cannabis
[32:49.630 --> 32:54.830]  strain. But if he does, he's going to open the floodgates for a lot of shit and people will start
[32:54.830 --> 32:58.990]  patenting their own strains. I bet you. And that means I'm gonna have to get on the game,
[33:00.190 --> 33:03.390]  get lawyered up a little bit harder for a lawyer that knows about patent laws too.
[33:04.270 --> 33:08.590]  God, this game is getting so vast. You have to have your hands in everything now to be able to
[33:08.590 --> 33:12.510]  keep up in this kind of a business. If you guys want to move to Colorado and get in the cannabis
[33:12.510 --> 33:16.910]  industry, I recommend you do like a year of research before you get into it. Maybe come
[33:16.910 --> 33:20.750]  here and talk to somebody who's in the industry. I can help you out a little bit. I don't know a
[33:20.750 --> 33:25.790]  lot about getting into the industry. I don't like into, if you want a dispensary or something,
[33:25.790 --> 33:30.190]  I don't know how to get you into there. That's going to be hard. So be careful. Let's see.
[33:30.190 --> 33:35.390]  What else do I want to talk about in this episode? I wanted to talk about the new year is coming up
[33:35.390 --> 33:39.230]  and the new year is always a good time. Everybody says they want to do New Year's resolutions and
[33:39.230 --> 33:45.550]  stuff. I think it's a good time to start a new grow calendar or a schedule to kind of make a
[33:45.550 --> 33:51.710]  game plan. Clean up your grow room, get everything started fresh again. And then instead of just
[33:51.710 --> 33:55.310]  cutting a bunch of clones and having a bunch of plants and veg and having some shit over here and
[33:55.310 --> 33:59.710]  some more shit over here. Think about what you're going to do. Think about how many lights you have
[33:59.710 --> 34:04.430]  in each space. How many flowering lights do you have? How many plants fit under each of those
[34:04.430 --> 34:10.430]  lights? How long do they take to flower? Okay. So you got about 65 days underneath this light,
[34:10.430 --> 34:14.750]  right? Well, in about 65 days, you need more plants to go under there, but you need a couple
[34:14.750 --> 34:18.590]  days to clean that. You got to trim, you got to sweep up, you got to wipe the walls down,
[34:18.590 --> 34:21.950]  you got to clean all the dirt out, you got to repot, you got to get shit back in there.
[34:21.950 --> 34:26.830]  So remember that in like nine weeks, you need more plants in there. So you got to cut clones
[34:26.830 --> 34:30.590]  about three to four, maybe five weeks before that, depending on how much space you have,
[34:30.590 --> 34:35.150]  you got to get your shit ready. So start planning. I think it's a good time for you guys to start
[34:35.150 --> 34:40.910]  working on an advanced grow calendar. I don't know how you want to do it. There are a lot of
[34:40.910 --> 34:44.750]  ways to go about it. Do it your way is what I recommend. Maybe we'll make an episode out of
[34:44.750 --> 34:48.670]  that, but it's the start of the year coming up and just make a calendar. Because if you pop a bunch
[34:48.670 --> 34:52.350]  of seeds, you cut a bunch of clones and you got a bedroom full and a flowering room full, and you
[34:52.350 --> 34:56.590]  don't have a full plan of where those plants are going, you're going to run into some problems.
[34:56.590 --> 35:00.910]  Overcrowding causes problems. Overcrowding promotes problems. You can't see that plan on
[35:00.910 --> 35:04.110]  the bottom. You can't tell there was a spider mite infestation there. You got spider mites
[35:04.110 --> 35:08.510]  everywhere. You got way too many plants. That shit's out of control. Just be diligent. Think
[35:08.510 --> 35:13.390]  in advance. Think ahead of yourself. Be like five steps ahead. That's how you be a good grower.
[35:13.390 --> 35:17.070]  Kind of try to predict what's going to happen in your plants. Don't just watch and see what
[35:17.070 --> 35:21.390]  happens. Be like, oh, this is going to happen because I've grown weed a million times and I've
[35:21.390 --> 35:25.950]  paid attention at least 10 of them. All right, I'm ranting again, but that's really important,
[35:25.950 --> 35:30.030]  I think. And it's the start of the year. So it's time for that to happen. It would be a good time
[35:30.030 --> 35:33.870]  for all of that. And clean up all your shit right at the start of the year. If your carbon filters
[35:33.870 --> 35:37.950]  are all mucky, buy some new carbon filters. If your bulbs are all shitty, get some new bulbs.
[35:37.950 --> 35:44.590]  It's the start of the year. Spoil your gardens. They spoil you back. That's my advice. That's my
[35:44.590 --> 35:50.350]  personal advice from the heart of Rasta Jeff. God, I must be dabbed out. I'm saying from the heart of
[35:50.350 --> 35:55.390]  Rasta Jeff. Grow from your heart, right? That's what I say. All right, I'm going to wrap up this
[35:55.390 --> 35:58.590]  episode, you guys. I hope you join me next week. It's going to be another quick episode. I'm going
[35:58.590 --> 36:04.190]  to go see the string cheese on the 29th, 30th, and 31st. The string cheese incident at the
[36:04.190 --> 36:08.430]  Broomfield. It's the first bank center in Broomfield. If you happen to run into me, say,
[36:08.430 --> 36:11.710]  what's up? Don't be shy. I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks. I'm probably wearing an
[36:11.710 --> 36:16.590]  Irie Genetics hoodie. If I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks and there's a little short chick
[36:16.590 --> 36:20.990]  with dreadlocks next to me and she's sweet looking, that's probably me. There's going to be a lot of
[36:20.990 --> 36:24.350]  people that match that description, but I'm probably wearing the Irie hoodie and she's
[36:24.350 --> 36:29.070]  probably got the Irie hoodie. I'll try to remember to take some stickers or something with me and
[36:29.070 --> 36:32.670]  throw them in my back pocket so that if you say, what's up, shake my hand, give me a hug, I'll give
[36:32.670 --> 36:37.390]  you a sticker. It'll be really funny when you hug the wrong hippie because there's going to be a
[36:37.390 --> 36:41.070]  bunch of tall white guys with dreadlocks there. So say what's up to me at the string cheese
[36:41.070 --> 36:44.670]  incident. If you see me, I hope to see you there. Maybe we'll smoke down or something. I'll have
[36:44.670 --> 36:47.470]  some dabs with me if we're not on the show. I don't know how I'm going to sneak my rig into
[36:47.470 --> 36:53.630]  the show, but I'll definitely have a spliff. All right, let's wrap this up. Man, happy new year,
[36:53.630 --> 36:56.510]  you guys. You guys might be, when are you listening to this? You might hear this on New
[36:56.510 --> 37:00.430]  Year's. Let me look at the calendar. When does this come out? When does this come out, bro?
[37:00.910 --> 37:03.630]  Going to the calendar. I'm not even going to press pause on the recording. I'm just going to do it.
[37:03.630 --> 37:06.830]  I'm going to try not to do any editing anymore. What do you think? Do you like it when I just
[37:06.830 --> 37:11.950]  talk a lot and don't, do you like when I talk about my life and my stuff and I don't just keep
[37:11.950 --> 37:15.550]  talking about weed and have it all scripted or do you want me to keep it tight? I want to know
[37:15.550 --> 37:19.950]  what you think. So this episode will come out on the 29th. Oh shit, you guys will probably,
[37:19.950 --> 37:23.470]  I hope you're listening to this on your way driving to the cheese show, wherever you are.
[37:23.470 --> 37:27.550]  So if you see me at string cheese, give me a hug. The next, happy new year also because
[37:28.510 --> 37:32.750]  Wednesday is the new year. So happy new year. Hope you guys are safe. Dude, don't drink and drive.
[37:33.950 --> 37:38.270]  Be safe. Take care of one another. Keep an eye out for each other. I don't, I want everybody to
[37:38.270 --> 37:42.350]  be able to see all your friends again tomorrow. So have a happy new year. You guys, I love you
[37:42.350 --> 37:46.110]  guys. Thanks for listening to the show. There's nothing cooler than having people that email you
[37:46.110 --> 37:51.470]  and tweet you until you're listening. So now that the show is over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher
[37:51.470 --> 37:56.030]  and find the iTunes or Stitcher main page. Search for I grow culture. Find the review section. Give
[37:56.030 --> 37:59.550]  me a five star rating, type in a comment. Let me know what you think of the show. And I will read
[37:59.550 --> 38:04.190]  your comments on the show. Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher and every
[38:04.190 --> 38:11.070]  single episode will always be archived on ireegeneticscolorado.com. Find us on Twitter,
[38:11.070 --> 38:15.230]  Instagram and Facebook search for I grow culture. I'm going to have to change all of that stuff
[38:15.230 --> 38:19.310]  to grow from your heart podcast. I hope all of those services will let me change my name at least
[38:19.310 --> 38:23.630]  once. I'm not sure how it's going to work, but I'll do it. I'm more focused on the string cheese
[38:23.630 --> 38:26.750]  concerts. I'll be gone for three days. I'll be gone for like four days. So I'm more worried about
[38:26.750 --> 38:31.790]  that right now than I am, um, getting the show stuff done because I don't have a logo yet and
[38:31.790 --> 38:34.670]  all that. But once I get the logo going, we'll get it happening at the start of the year. You guys,
[38:34.670 --> 38:38.830]  it'll all be rocking. Stay with me, please. Don't, don't abandon me right around episode 50. That'd
[38:38.830 --> 38:43.950]  be weird. Uh, also follow Iree genetics on Instagram. That's not going anywhere. Well,
[38:43.950 --> 38:48.430]  unless I region or unless Instagram fucks me like Facebook did. If you guys are interested in
[38:48.430 --> 38:52.350]  sponsoring the podcast, or if you have a product you'd like me to review, send me an email at
[38:52.350 --> 38:57.070]  I grow culture at hotmail.com and I'll get you all of the info you need. Uh, we do need a theme
[38:57.070 --> 39:02.430]  song and a logo, a big, super huge shout out to my ninja Spence. Also big shout out to Maddie,
