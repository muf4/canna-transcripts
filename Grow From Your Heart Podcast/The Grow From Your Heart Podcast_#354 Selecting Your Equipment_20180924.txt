[00:00.000 --> 00:02.340]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.340 --> 00:06.120]  It's time for episode 354 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.120 --> 00:10.400]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.140]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:15.140 --> 00:19.020]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:19.020 --> 00:23.380]  It seems to have become tradition that I start the show off by letting you know what I'm
[00:23.380 --> 00:24.380]  smoking.
[00:24.380 --> 00:29.980]  Today, I'm taking dabs of the blueberry citron fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.300]  On the last episode, I described the flavor as oranges rolled in sugar with a hint of
[00:35.300 --> 00:36.740]  purple Laffy Taffys.
[00:36.740 --> 00:38.580]  I really enjoy this concentrate.
[00:38.580 --> 00:42.860]  I've got a lot of it, so we'll be smoking this for a couple of episodes.
[00:42.860 --> 00:47.760]  This is going to be the third episode in my long series of grow lessons.
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.940]  In the past two episodes, we talked a little bit about setting goals and planning your
[00:51.940 --> 00:52.940]  grow.
[00:52.940 --> 00:56.860]  Then we talked more specifically about selecting and planning your space.
[00:56.980 --> 01:01.780]  In this episode, we're going to focus more in on the equipment and choosing the appropriate
[01:01.780 --> 01:03.800]  equipment for your grow.
[01:03.800 --> 01:07.420]  We need the right equipment for the size of your grow, we need the right equipment to
[01:07.420 --> 01:13.340]  meet your goals, and we need the right equipment to meet our power consumption limits.
[01:13.340 --> 01:18.380]  Let's get into a podcast all about selecting equipment for your new grow.
[01:18.380 --> 01:23.500]  In a previous episode, we talked about selecting your space and thinking about your goals.
[01:23.500 --> 01:28.220]  Your space is really going to dictate how much light you can put in there.
[01:28.220 --> 01:34.140]  Your amount of electricity available is really going to dictate how much gear we put in there.
[01:34.140 --> 01:38.300]  Try to keep these things in mind and have realistic expectations of your garden while
[01:38.300 --> 01:41.260]  we're designing and building your new grow.
[01:41.260 --> 01:43.820]  Now let's talk about selecting lighting.
[01:43.820 --> 01:48.460]  Lighting is probably the number one decision to make when designing a new grow.
[01:48.460 --> 01:54.160]  If you've got a small closet or a very small cupboard area, your lighting options are going
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.100]  to be limited to smaller, lower-powered lights that don't put off a lot of heat.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.100]  But that's okay.
[02:00.100 --> 02:06.260]  As long as they light your small space appropriately, you don't need a gigantic light in there.
[02:06.260 --> 02:10.760]  For a small closet or a cupboard or something that's been converted into a grow space like
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.580]  a dresser or an armoire or a storage cabinet or something that's incognito, something like
[02:16.620 --> 02:18.860]  our friends at Love for the Plant would create.
[02:18.860 --> 02:22.960]  If you're running a small space, maybe a T5 light would work in there.
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.340]  If you want to upgrade from a T5, your next best option is an LED.
[02:27.340 --> 02:30.020]  LEDs are great for small spaces.
[02:30.020 --> 02:32.820]  LED technology has come a long way.
[02:32.820 --> 02:36.460]  I do not have a lot of personal experience with LEDs.
[02:36.460 --> 02:39.740]  I also don't have a lot of experience in small spaces.
[02:39.740 --> 02:43.100]  I have seen LEDs kill it in little spaces.
[02:43.100 --> 02:45.580]  They do very well for small home grows.
[02:45.580 --> 02:49.940]  If you've got an apartment or somewhere where you can't take up a lot of power, an LED is
[02:49.940 --> 02:50.940]  a great option.
[02:50.940 --> 02:55.620]  It works great in a closet, in a cupboard, or in a small piece of furniture that has
[02:55.620 --> 03:00.860]  been converted into your little secret home grow space that's hidden right there in plain
[03:00.860 --> 03:01.860]  sight.
[03:01.860 --> 03:06.580]  A T5 light is probably your beginner light, your lowest-powered light that I would recommend
[03:06.580 --> 03:08.140]  growing cannabis with.
[03:08.140 --> 03:09.820]  Then you've got your LED lights.
[03:09.820 --> 03:14.060]  If you've got a small space, a T5 or an LED may work for you.
[03:14.060 --> 03:18.700]  When we work our way into something like a tent or a small enclosure that we have built
[03:18.700 --> 03:23.100]  or maybe a mini room that we have sectioned off, that's when you can work your way into
[03:23.100 --> 03:27.860]  either more or larger T5s, more or larger LEDs.
[03:27.860 --> 03:31.140]  You can buy more of them or you can get higher-powered LEDs.
[03:31.140 --> 03:35.280]  Or there are also ceramic metal halide lights.
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.300]  Ceramic metal halides are great in the same way that LEDs are because they don't put off
[03:39.300 --> 03:40.300]  a lot of heat.
[03:40.300 --> 03:44.780]  The T5s, the LEDs, and the ceramic metal halides are going to be fairly low heat.
[03:44.780 --> 03:49.500]  There is heat, but not as much as you're going to get from the high-intensity discharge lighting
[03:49.500 --> 03:51.980]  that we're going to talk about here in just a minute.
[03:51.980 --> 03:54.980]  The T5, the LED, and the ceramic metal halide are great for a tent.
[03:54.980 --> 03:57.100]  They don't put off a lot of heat.
[03:57.100 --> 03:59.660]  They also do not consume a lot of electricity.
[03:59.660 --> 04:03.780]  If you are limited on electrical consumption, those are great options.
[04:03.780 --> 04:08.540]  Another advantage of the T5s, the LEDs, and the ceramic metal halide is that since they
[04:08.540 --> 04:13.100]  don't put off so much heat on their own, you don't have to buy more cooling equipment
[04:13.100 --> 04:15.940]  to plug in and use even more electricity.
[04:15.940 --> 04:17.500]  So it's kind of a win-win with those.
[04:17.500 --> 04:22.260]  However, I don't feel like they put out the same harvest weight that a high-intensity
[04:22.260 --> 04:24.620]  discharge light will put out.
[04:24.620 --> 04:29.600]  But if you're limited on space and limited on electrical consumption and you're not able
[04:29.600 --> 04:34.260]  to cool it, those smaller lights are absolutely the way to go.
[04:34.260 --> 04:38.260]  So now let's talk a little bit about high-intensity discharge lighting.
[04:38.260 --> 04:41.940]  And I'm not going to focus too much on any specific kind of lighting or brand because
[04:41.940 --> 04:45.460]  I'm not here to really sell you any type of product.
[04:45.460 --> 04:50.040]  I want to give you guidance on the things that you may want to pay attention to while
[04:50.040 --> 04:52.260]  you're thinking about building your grow.
[04:52.260 --> 04:56.140]  I'm not going to pitch you specific stuff because that's up to you to decide.
[04:56.140 --> 04:59.780]  I want you to customize your grow, but I'm going to give you a really good blueprint
[04:59.780 --> 05:03.560]  and a really good idea of how to get to your goal.
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.300]  So let's talk more about high-intensity discharge lighting.
[05:07.340 --> 05:11.820]  High-intensity discharge lighting is like a high-pressure sodium or a metal halide bulb.
[05:11.820 --> 05:14.760]  They are powered by a ballast that you plug into the wall.
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.780]  That ballast generates more power to power that large high-intensity discharge bulb.
[05:19.780 --> 05:24.940]  They put off a lot of light and a lot of heat as well.
[05:24.940 --> 05:27.740]  I've seen 250-watt high-pressure sodium bulbs.
[05:27.740 --> 05:31.980]  I'm sure they make smaller, but I've never seen it offered in a grow store or anything.
[05:31.980 --> 05:33.120]  I've never looked for it.
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.520]  I have used and seen a 250-watt, 400-watt high-pressure sodium and metal halides are
[05:38.520 --> 05:39.520]  very common.
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.940]  600s are fairly common, and 1000s are the industry standard.
[05:43.940 --> 05:48.400]  If you're using high-intensity discharge lighting in a commercial facility, they are probably
[05:48.400 --> 05:49.840]  1000-watt lights.
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.800]  They are probably double-ended Govitas, which is a whole step up.
[05:53.800 --> 05:58.360]  We'll talk about that a little bit later when we get into the warehouse environment.
[05:58.360 --> 06:01.360]  But if you've got a tent, you can use the T5s.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.620]  You can use LEDs.
[06:02.620 --> 06:07.720]  You can use ceramic metal halides, or you can work your way into a small high-intensity
[06:07.720 --> 06:08.920]  discharge light.
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.180]  You can use a 250 in a small tent, maybe a 3x3.
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.660]  I wouldn't go any larger.
[06:13.660 --> 06:20.420]  You can use anything from a 400 to 1000-watt high-intensity discharge light in a 5x5 tent,
[06:20.420 --> 06:24.420]  and you should be okay if you learn how to control the temperature properly.
[06:24.420 --> 06:28.980]  You're going to need to duct the light, and in a moment, we will talk about ducted lighting.
[06:28.980 --> 06:31.900]  So if you're going with the tent, you can use T5 lights.
[06:32.020 --> 06:36.500]  T5s, you got to get them real close to the plant to get a lot of real productive growth,
[06:36.500 --> 06:37.860]  and it takes a lot of them.
[06:37.860 --> 06:44.140]  T5s, I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are on a low budget for lights and power consumption.
[06:44.140 --> 06:48.860]  LEDs are very brand and style specific.
[06:48.860 --> 06:52.460]  You have to learn the light you've got and the plants you've got together.
[06:52.460 --> 06:57.060]  I don't have enough experience with the LEDs, but I've seen some kick-ass product come from
[06:57.060 --> 06:58.220]  LED lighting.
[06:58.220 --> 07:01.700]  They also don't put out a lot of heat, and they don't use up a lot of electricity, so
[07:01.700 --> 07:04.340]  that's great in a tent or a small room environment.
[07:04.340 --> 07:08.260]  The ceramic metal halides are very similar to the LEDs.
[07:08.260 --> 07:09.300]  They don't use a lot of power.
[07:09.300 --> 07:13.500]  They don't put off a lot of heat, and you get a quality product that should make you
[07:13.500 --> 07:14.740]  happy.
[07:14.740 --> 07:19.140]  Those are going to be fairly easy to cool in a small space, in a small tent.
[07:19.140 --> 07:23.940]  Then if we work our way into the small high-intensity discharge lighting, that's when you have to
[07:23.940 --> 07:27.800]  start thinking about cooling the room much more efficiently.
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.580]  You have to think about getting that heat out and getting fresh air into the room.
[07:31.580 --> 07:34.700]  That's when you start thinking about ducted lights or open lights.
[07:34.700 --> 07:37.380]  We're going to talk about that more in a second.
[07:37.380 --> 07:41.140]  Just keep in mind for now that the bigger light we use, the more cooling we're going
[07:41.140 --> 07:43.860]  to have to focus on, which will be more electricity.
[07:43.860 --> 07:47.820]  You're pulling a bigger light, and now you're adding more cooling, so you're doubling up
[07:47.820 --> 07:49.140]  your electrical load.
[07:49.140 --> 07:50.460]  Keep that in mind.
[07:50.460 --> 07:55.980]  Now let's move from a larger space, from a one-light situation to maybe a two- or four-light
[07:55.980 --> 07:59.900]  situation where we've got a larger tent or maybe a dedicated room.
[07:59.900 --> 08:02.180]  Let's talk about our lighting options there.
[08:02.180 --> 08:04.220]  This is where I would move away from the T5s.
[08:04.220 --> 08:07.180]  I wouldn't consider a T5 if you're doing this much.
[08:07.180 --> 08:08.180]  You're just wasting light.
[08:08.180 --> 08:09.180]  You're wasting electricity.
[08:09.180 --> 08:10.640]  You're not going to see production.
[08:10.640 --> 08:12.980]  If you've got four lights, you need production.
[08:12.980 --> 08:13.980]  Let's hang up some real lights.
[08:13.980 --> 08:15.100]  You can go with LEDs.
[08:15.100 --> 08:19.060]  Get a quality LED, something with high output, not a little starter LED.
[08:19.060 --> 08:21.140]  You need a good one if you're going this route.
[08:21.140 --> 08:23.840]  Or multiple ceramic metal halide lights.
[08:23.840 --> 08:27.660]  You can place them closer together because they don't take as much electricity.
[08:27.660 --> 08:28.900]  You can have more of them.
[08:28.900 --> 08:30.100]  You can cover more of a footprint.
[08:30.100 --> 08:36.260]  I think they cover about a three-by-three, maybe a four-by-four area for the 315 ceramic
[08:36.260 --> 08:37.400]  metal halide.
[08:37.400 --> 08:41.100]  Your LED light is going to be very light and brand-specific.
[08:41.100 --> 08:44.060]  It should tell you what the footprint covers on there.
[08:44.060 --> 08:47.540]  Go a little smaller than that, and I think you'll be happy.
[08:47.540 --> 08:49.960]  For a room, step away from the T5s.
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.140]  Maybe get a high-powered LED, maybe multiple ceramic metal halides.
[08:54.140 --> 09:00.260]  Or in a room, this is where we can start using multiple 600 and or multiple 1,000-watt
[09:00.260 --> 09:02.740]  high-intensity discharge lights.
[09:02.740 --> 09:07.280]  I think I've kind of covered the pros and cons of the LEDs and the ceramic metal halides.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.660]  They don't use a lot of electricity.
[09:08.660 --> 09:12.540]  They don't make a lot of heat, but they also don't put out like a high-intensity discharge
[09:12.540 --> 09:13.540]  light.
[09:13.540 --> 09:18.640]  Now let's talk about the differences between a 600 and 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.580]  bulb for flowering.
[09:20.580 --> 09:25.180]  With two 600s, you can cover a little more space with less shadow.
[09:25.180 --> 09:30.980]  With 1,000-watt, you can cover a really nice space with a whole lot of light.
[09:30.980 --> 09:31.980]  So it's kind of up to you.
[09:31.980 --> 09:36.180]  Do you want to run two 6s, or do you want to run 1,000?
[09:36.180 --> 09:38.360]  Keep in mind the height, how much height you've got.
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.780]  If your ceiling is low, go with the 600s.
[09:40.780 --> 09:44.340]  If you're not able to do a lot of cooling, go with the 600s.
[09:44.340 --> 09:48.700]  Think about 600-watt lights or 1,000-watt lights when you're planning your grow.
[09:48.820 --> 09:53.420]  The 600-watt high-pressure sodium light will be more efficient if you're trying to decide
[09:53.420 --> 09:55.780]  between a 600 and 1,000.
[09:55.780 --> 09:59.980]  But the 1,000 is going to push your plants just a little bit more.
[09:59.980 --> 10:04.500]  Now earlier what I said about shadows, what I mean is if you've got 1,000-watt bulb coming
[10:04.500 --> 10:08.780]  from right above all of your plants, you've got one source of light, you're going to create
[10:08.780 --> 10:11.980]  shadows because you only have light coming from one direction.
[10:11.980 --> 10:16.060]  If you have two 6s that are just a little bit apart, you've got light coming from two
[10:16.140 --> 10:20.700]  directions, so that will give you less shadows, more of your buds will get light, and that
[10:20.700 --> 10:25.500]  is actually a little more efficient than one bulb and a bunch of shadows.
[10:25.500 --> 10:31.960]  Now is probably a good time to start thinking about open or ducted light reflectors.
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.780]  Just to be clear about what I'm talking about, when we hang up our grow lights, that enclosure
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.820]  is known as the reflector.
[10:37.820 --> 10:41.820]  Then we screw the bulb into the socket and cord set.
[10:41.820 --> 10:43.020]  That runs to the ballast.
[10:43.020 --> 10:47.140]  The ballast plugs into, it's got another cord that plugs into the wall.
[10:47.140 --> 10:53.380]  So that reflector, they are available in tons of different styles at this point.
[10:53.380 --> 10:56.580]  Right now let's think about vented or open.
[10:56.580 --> 11:01.100]  Do you want a light that's got glass between your grow and the bulb so that it keeps that
[11:01.100 --> 11:04.980]  heat in there and we can set up ducting to move that heat out of the room?
[11:04.980 --> 11:10.060]  Or do you want to allow that heat from the bulb to enter the grow room and combat that
[11:10.060 --> 11:11.820]  with air conditioning?
[11:11.820 --> 11:14.140]  Both are reasonable options.
[11:14.140 --> 11:16.740]  Both have their pros and cons.
[11:16.740 --> 11:20.940]  Not ducting your lights means that you've got to cool that room.
[11:20.940 --> 11:23.740]  That means you've got to add air conditioning.
[11:23.740 --> 11:26.580]  We'll talk about air conditioning options in just a minute.
[11:26.580 --> 11:31.420]  Now if you do choose to vent your lights, make sure you run the ducting to where none
[11:31.420 --> 11:37.100]  of the odor from your grow is going to make it out of wherever that air is being expelled
[11:37.100 --> 11:38.580]  from your area.
[11:38.580 --> 11:43.100]  We don't need to blow that hot cannabis aroma right into the neighbor's bedroom window.
[11:43.100 --> 11:45.580]  So think about that when you're setting up your grow.
[11:45.580 --> 11:49.300]  We'll talk about carbon filters and odor control here in just a minute.
[11:49.300 --> 11:53.180]  So think about if you want to duct and have cooled lights or if you want to have open
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.180]  lights.
[11:54.180 --> 11:57.500]  If you've got ducted vented lights, there will be a piece of glass between the bulb
[11:57.500 --> 12:00.700]  and your plants that needs to stay clean.
[12:00.700 --> 12:02.060]  Also that means more equipment.
[12:02.060 --> 12:03.620]  That means we need a powerful blower.
[12:03.620 --> 12:07.720]  We need some ducting and we need something running it out of the grow space, possibly
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.800]  out of the house, which is going to need to be camouflaged and taken care of discreetly.
[12:12.800 --> 12:15.680]  The advantage to ducting your lights is less cooling.
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.840]  You're not going to need as much air conditioning.
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.440]  You're going to need one blower to blow over the lights to get that hot air out of there.
[12:22.440 --> 12:27.320]  If that hot air is going out of the house or out of your building, you need carbon filtration,
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.080]  which we're going to talk about in just a minute.
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.040]  So back in the day, most home grows were designed with ducted lights.
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.480]  Most commercial grows, however, do not use vented or ducted lights.
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.280]  We use gavitas, which are hung really high because we need them about three feet, maybe
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.040]  more from the canopy because they do get really hot.
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.200]  They are so intense, not just from heat, but so intense from light that they can cause
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.560]  burn and wrinkle and bleaching on the tips of the plants.
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.420]  So in a commercial environment, we use non-ducted lighting.
[12:57.420 --> 13:01.920]  In a home grow, it is very common to see the ducted lighting.
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.480]  A lot of home grows now, a lot of guys are going hard and they're actually hanging up
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.920]  the lower wattage gavitas.
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.200]  They're hanging up the gavita 750s and I'm seeing great success with that.
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.500]  You will need to know how to trellis and control the height of your canopy if you plan on using
[13:15.500 --> 13:21.240]  gavitas in a basement or in a bedroom, unless you've got extremely high ceilings.
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.380]  So for a home grow, here's a quick, just a quick breakdown of how I would do it.
[13:24.380 --> 13:28.400]  It would go carbon filter and I would have the appropriate carbon filter for the size
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.560]  of my room.
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.120]  Then I would have a blower and I would have an appropriate blower to go with that carbon
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.520]  filter, either a six inch or an eight inch, maybe a 10, maybe a 12, depending on the size
[13:38.520 --> 13:40.800]  of the grow and how many lights.
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.000]  Then possibly a Y, I'd have a piece of ducting that sits on my blower that maybe goes to
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  a Y.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.120]  If I'm running four or six lights, I will do the Y and I will run three lights parallel
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.720]  or two lights parallel to where it goes.
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.080]  Carbon filter, blower, Y duct, then coming off of each side of the Y, we've got a little
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.080]  ducting.
[14:01.080 --> 14:04.440]  Then we've got a vented light, a little more ducting, a vented light.
[14:04.440 --> 14:07.320]  Then those two ducts, sometimes they come together.
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.740]  Sometimes I don't put them back together, depending on where I'm exiting with that ducting.
[14:11.740 --> 14:16.560]  Then they go out of the grow area, whether out of the house, whether out of the building,
[14:16.560 --> 14:17.560]  just depends on where I am.
[14:17.560 --> 14:21.480]  Maybe it goes out of the room into another room where it's taken care of there, but it
[14:21.480 --> 14:27.880]  goes carbon filter, blower, maybe a Y, maybe not, and then lights, and then maybe back
[14:27.880 --> 14:29.680]  together, maybe not, and then out.
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.040]  Then at the end there, it's always a good idea to have something to prevent other things
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.640]  from climbing into the grow.
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.640]  You don't want to get a mouse that feels a bunch of warm air coming out of there in the
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.480]  middle of the night and he's like, oh, look, a little warm duct and a mouse or a lizard
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.880]  or somebody, possibly a snake, climbs right into your ducting, ends up in your grow light,
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.260]  cooks itself, maybe makes it all the way to the blower, shreds itself.
[14:49.260 --> 14:50.580]  I don't know what could happen.
[14:50.580 --> 14:51.700]  Put something on the end there.
[14:51.700 --> 14:52.940]  It may sound crazy.
[14:52.940 --> 14:54.780]  A pair of pantyhose works beautifully.
[14:54.780 --> 14:57.380]  Go to the local Walgreens or whatever.
[14:57.380 --> 15:01.340]  You may look like a weirdo if you're a big dude, but buy a couple of pair of black pantyhose
[15:01.340 --> 15:04.780]  and then just like a condom, stretch them over the end of your ducting, secure it with
[15:04.780 --> 15:07.900]  some duct tape, and that way nothing can climb up in the end there.
[15:07.900 --> 15:12.100]  They do sell more expensive options to put at the end of your ducting, but pantyhose
[15:12.100 --> 15:15.980]  will work just fine if you use a couple of layers.
[15:15.980 --> 15:18.940]  And here's a really random piece of advice while I'm thinking about it.
[15:18.940 --> 15:25.620]  If you have got that end going outside, you're going to have to put some bends in your ducting
[15:25.620 --> 15:32.460]  to prevent light from coming down that ducting during your dark cycle if there is light outside.
[15:32.460 --> 15:38.540]  So you've got that ducting that goes, it's a carbon filter blower, ducting, light, ducting,
[15:38.540 --> 15:42.220]  maybe another light, maybe more ducting, then out of the house, right?
[15:42.220 --> 15:45.020]  Now imagine the sun comes up and your lights aren't on yet.
[15:45.020 --> 15:48.900]  If that sun is shining toward the direction of that duct, it'll shine light right down
[15:48.900 --> 15:51.060]  that ducting and it's reflective on the inside.
[15:51.060 --> 15:53.940]  So it's going to bounce through there and end up into your grow room and it'll come
[15:53.940 --> 15:56.100]  out of the lights looking just like a grow light.
[15:56.100 --> 15:59.700]  It'll be a low power grow light, but it'll be coming out and the plants will think it's
[15:59.700 --> 16:02.060]  daytime because that sun is awesome.
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.060]  That sun will tell them, wake up little ladies, and they will.
[16:05.060 --> 16:06.740]  So you've got to prevent that.
[16:06.740 --> 16:12.300]  Put some sort of a light baffle outside and also bend the ducting on the inside to prevent
[16:12.300 --> 16:13.300]  that.
[16:13.300 --> 16:17.500]  Go in there and turn off the lights in your grow and just hang out and see if it is totally
[16:17.500 --> 16:18.500]  dark in there.
[16:18.500 --> 16:19.620]  We'll talk about this in another episode.
[16:19.620 --> 16:23.020]  If you can see your hand in front of your face at all, it is too dark.
[16:23.020 --> 16:26.420]  We need absolute darkness in the grow.
[16:26.420 --> 16:32.780]  So that's a lot of talk about ducted or vented lights and non-vented or open lights.
[16:32.780 --> 16:37.100]  They've both got their pros and cons, but the lighting you decide may dictate a lot
[16:37.100 --> 16:38.940]  of the rest of your setup.
[16:38.940 --> 16:41.580]  So be careful when you choose your lighting.
[16:41.580 --> 16:44.420]  Now let's talk about moving into larger spaces.
[16:44.420 --> 16:50.620]  If you've got a barn or an outbuilding with high ceilings and a lot of electrical availability,
[16:50.620 --> 16:55.420]  then I would recommend moving into double-ended bulb technology.
[16:55.420 --> 16:57.260]  They are much more high output.
[16:57.260 --> 17:01.900]  They do put off a lot more heat, but the plants will definitely show you the difference.
[17:01.900 --> 17:06.980]  I can pull about three pounds per light consistently from a double-ended bulb.
[17:06.980 --> 17:11.100]  Now I know earlier I said I would try not to talk about brands and pitch brands to you,
[17:11.100 --> 17:16.420]  but the industry standard for the double-ended horticultural bulb in a Colorado commercial
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.820]  grow facility is of course the Goveda.
[17:18.820 --> 17:22.660]  So I try not to recommend too many brands to you, but I'll tell you straight up, I would
[17:22.660 --> 17:26.700]  use the Govedas if I were going to build a large grow right now.
[17:26.700 --> 17:28.460]  As many of them as I can fit.
[17:28.460 --> 17:33.580]  I want about one Goveda per four by four or five by five foot space.
[17:33.580 --> 17:37.660]  So for a warehouse or a commercial environment, or maybe a large barn with high ceilings,
[17:37.660 --> 17:40.780]  I would always recommend the double-ended technology.
[17:40.780 --> 17:42.660]  Of course, I would recommend a Goveda.
[17:42.660 --> 17:45.500]  However, they do produce a lot of heat.
[17:45.500 --> 17:49.060]  You're going to need more cooling if you're using Govedas.
[17:49.060 --> 17:50.980]  Also you need those high ceilings.
[17:50.980 --> 17:57.260]  I recommend you keep your Goveda lights about three feet, maybe more from the top of your
[17:57.260 --> 18:02.580]  plants unless you've got some serious cooling, you want those lights about three feet away
[18:02.580 --> 18:03.900]  from the top of your canopy.
[18:03.900 --> 18:07.540]  So think about that by the end of flower, if you've got big giant buds, you still need
[18:07.540 --> 18:12.980]  three foot of space, or you're going to start burning and bleaching the tips of your plants.
[18:12.980 --> 18:16.580]  Now for veg, you can use whatever kind of light you're comfortable with.
[18:16.580 --> 18:21.740]  Vegging T5s work for small plants, LEDs and ceramic metal halides will definitely work
[18:21.740 --> 18:23.820]  for veg for smaller plants.
[18:23.820 --> 18:28.620]  If you're going to get into a commercial grow, I would recommend 400s, 600s if you can, or
[18:28.620 --> 18:34.100]  even just veg under your thousands or in a commercial environment, try to veg under Govedas.
[18:34.100 --> 18:38.580]  They make metal halide and high pressure sodium bulbs for your Govedas.
[18:38.580 --> 18:43.260]  And just because I know somebody is going to ask, for vegging, we prefer metal halide bulbs.
[18:43.260 --> 18:48.060]  You want more of the blue spectrum for veg that keeps your plants shorter and helps them root.
[18:48.060 --> 18:51.180]  For flowering, we want high pressure sodium.
[18:51.180 --> 18:53.460]  That's more of a orange and red spectrum.
[18:53.460 --> 18:56.340]  That's going to give you bigger fruits and more growth.
[18:56.340 --> 19:01.100]  So metal halide for veg, high pressure sodium for flower.
[19:01.100 --> 19:04.100]  Way different spectrums are going to be available for your LED lighting.
[19:04.100 --> 19:07.580]  Check out your specific light manufacturer's options.
[19:07.580 --> 19:12.900]  There are so many options for LEDs that I cannot even get specific, you guys.
[19:12.900 --> 19:14.980]  So let's quickly recap lighting.
[19:14.980 --> 19:18.980]  If you're in a tent or a small space, T5s are a good option.
[19:18.980 --> 19:20.260]  LEDs will work for you.
[19:20.260 --> 19:26.060]  You could work with a small ceramic halide or maybe a very small 250 watt high pressure
[19:26.060 --> 19:28.020]  sodium, but I wouldn't go much more than that.
[19:28.340 --> 19:32.420]  When you start working into the smaller tents or a small room, that's when you can start
[19:32.420 --> 19:36.660]  introducing the bigger lights, the small HIDs, the 250 or a 400.
[19:36.660 --> 19:41.700]  If you get yourself a 5x5 tent, that's when you can step up to a 600 or a 1000 watt light.
[19:41.700 --> 19:45.660]  When you start working on a production grow, you're busting out a whole room, a dedicated
[19:45.660 --> 19:47.660]  space, or maybe a larger tent.
[19:47.660 --> 19:52.420]  That's when you can work your way into multiple 600s or multiple 1000 watt lights.
[19:52.420 --> 19:56.300]  And of course, if you're going to run a warehouse, I highly recommend double-ended bulb
[19:56.300 --> 19:57.260]  technology.
[19:57.260 --> 20:00.420]  Again, I recommend the Govitas and they do not pay me.
[20:00.420 --> 20:04.380]  Now keep in mind that your lights are going to heat the room very quickly.
[20:04.380 --> 20:10.100]  You're going to need appropriate air conditioning and you're going to need appropriate air flow.
[20:10.100 --> 20:14.980]  So let's talk about air conditioning and then we will work our way into air flow and odor
[20:14.980 --> 20:16.620]  control.
[20:16.620 --> 20:17.620]  Air conditioning, cooling.
[20:17.620 --> 20:24.220]  In a small grow environment, you can probably get away with a small window air conditioner.
[20:24.220 --> 20:28.940]  Now maybe you don't have the option of installing a small window air conditioner.
[20:28.940 --> 20:31.460]  You can also use those portable air conditioners.
[20:31.460 --> 20:33.500]  They're on wheels and they have ducting.
[20:33.500 --> 20:37.740]  They have a duct that brings the air in and a duct that shoots the old hot air out.
[20:37.740 --> 20:41.020]  I like to use those, but I do not use the in duct.
[20:41.020 --> 20:43.460]  I only use the duct that shoots the heat out.
[20:43.460 --> 20:47.580]  I keep the air from my grow room being recycled in the grow, so I'm not bringing out that
[20:47.580 --> 20:51.420]  air from outside and introducing it into the grow room.
[20:51.420 --> 20:56.180]  There's no filtration in that air conditioner before that air gets into my grow, so I don't
[20:56.180 --> 20:59.300]  want to suck in some weird stuff and bring it into the grow.
[20:59.300 --> 21:00.500]  So I don't use that duct.
[21:00.500 --> 21:03.900]  I only use the out duct on a portable air conditioner.
[21:03.900 --> 21:06.580]  Now those portable air conditioners are very inefficient.
[21:06.580 --> 21:11.620]  They cost a lot of money to buy and they cost a lot of money to run, but they are very discreet.
[21:11.620 --> 21:14.900]  They are very portable and they work very well.
[21:14.900 --> 21:16.780]  They'll cool the room down very quickly.
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.860]  You can kind of roll it right to where you need it.
[21:18.860 --> 21:20.880]  Those are always an option.
[21:20.880 --> 21:24.640]  Another thing to think about with air conditioning is you've got air going out of your grow room
[21:24.640 --> 21:26.880]  now that is not filtered.
[21:26.880 --> 21:33.240]  If your room with your grow is right up against your neighbor's house also, putting that air
[21:33.240 --> 21:36.960]  conditioner in that window may not be an option because you might start blasting that sweet
[21:36.960 --> 21:40.360]  ganja smell right into your neighbor's bedroom and they're going to be trying to sleep and
[21:40.360 --> 21:43.680]  they're just going to be dreaming about smoking a joint at a fish concert.
[21:43.680 --> 21:47.520]  So be careful where you duct your air conditioning air.
[21:47.640 --> 21:53.840]  Now another really important thing to think about is how much air conditioning do we need
[21:53.840 --> 21:58.400]  in a small grow, in a residential grow, not a warehouse type of environment.
[21:58.400 --> 22:05.040]  If you're using thousand watt high pressure sodium lights, I recommend about 3000 BTUs
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.360]  of cooling per thousand watt light.
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.000]  I'll say that again for you.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.520]  I recommend 3000 BTUs of cooling for every thousand watt light.
[22:16.520 --> 22:19.920]  So if you've got two lights, you want 6,000 watts of air conditioning.
[22:19.920 --> 22:23.640]  If you've got four lights, you want 12,000 watts of air conditioning.
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.760]  I also recommend go a little extra because it's been hot lately.
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.080]  Every summer it gets hotter and hotter and I don't want you to struggle in your grow
[22:32.080 --> 22:33.120]  with heat.
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.720]  A lot of the companies that make the portable air conditioners make a 14,000 BTU unit.
[22:38.720 --> 22:44.240]  That is just about perfect for a 4,000 watt light setup, which is beautiful for a spare
[22:44.240 --> 22:45.240]  bedroom.
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.240]  So that's another important thing to think about.
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.920]  Now, if you're in a tiny grow like a closet or maybe a space that you've built, I understand
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.960]  that you can't install an air conditioner.
[22:52.960 --> 22:56.960]  The way you're going to have to cool that is by putting a blower somewhere in there
[22:56.960 --> 23:02.920]  and exhausting the heat out of that enclosure into the main room and then pulling air in
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.960]  through maybe a passive duct from the room that's already got nice fresh air.
[23:06.960 --> 23:09.120]  If you're in the room, it's probably comfortable for the plant.
[23:09.120 --> 23:12.720]  So if you're ducting out that hot air and just pulling in fresh air through a passive
[23:12.720 --> 23:16.320]  vent in like a small enclosure, that will work perfectly.
[23:16.320 --> 23:21.040]  Just make sure you've got enough power to suck the air out of that enclosure often enough.
[23:21.040 --> 23:25.760]  And also make sure you put a carbon filter on there so that you don't snitch on yourself
[23:25.760 --> 23:30.080]  and blow that fresh ganja scented air right into the living room where everybody's hanging
[23:30.080 --> 23:31.080]  out.
[23:31.080 --> 23:32.880]  You think you've got this little enclosure, it's all smooth.
[23:32.880 --> 23:35.840]  You've got a fish tank set up next to it so that all the noise is covered and all the
[23:35.840 --> 23:37.120]  plugins are covered.
[23:37.120 --> 23:41.220]  You've got an excuse for everything, but every time they walk past it, they just get blown
[23:41.220 --> 23:43.460]  with wind that smells like ganja.
[23:43.460 --> 23:45.220]  Pay attention to that sort of stuff, you guys.
[23:45.220 --> 23:48.780]  So in a small enclosure, you're going to have to use a blower to close it or to cool it.
[23:48.780 --> 23:52.420]  And you're going to have to use passive air from the room to cool that.
[23:52.420 --> 23:55.260]  And like I said, if you're in the room, if that's where you live, if that's where you're
[23:55.260 --> 23:57.860]  hanging out, it's probably comfortable for the plants.
[23:57.860 --> 24:01.940]  It's not going to be perfect, but in a small enclosure, that may be the best you can do.
[24:01.940 --> 24:08.760]  Now let's talk about cooling a giant facility, a warehouse, or maybe a small barn.
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.720]  When it comes to cooling, Govita lighting, it is a totally different ball game.
[24:12.720 --> 24:15.280]  This is when we move into industrial cooling.
[24:15.280 --> 24:17.600]  This is when we move into rooftop units.
[24:17.600 --> 24:21.220]  We can't use little wall units and portable units anymore.
[24:21.220 --> 24:25.940]  We have to get big boy air conditioning and HVAC setups.
[24:25.940 --> 24:30.760]  So if you're setting up an industrial grow and you're going to hang Govitas, I will recommend
[24:30.760 --> 24:40.600]  between four and 6,000 BTU per Govita or one ton of cooling for every two Govita fixtures
[24:40.600 --> 24:42.240]  in the room.
[24:42.240 --> 24:47.000]  Another thing I will recommend is instead of one large rooftop unit, so let's say you
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.680]  need 30 tons of cooling in your room, I would recommend that you break that 30 tons up amongst
[24:52.680 --> 24:58.200]  multiple units so that if you have a failure in one unit, you can still run at three quarters
[24:58.200 --> 25:01.420]  or half of your capacity and not have to shut down the room.
[25:01.420 --> 25:05.760]  If you can keep it just cool enough to survive with three, but you've got four most of the
[25:05.760 --> 25:08.640]  time, one breaks, you've still got three running strong.
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.840]  If they can push it and keep the room cool, you're still in business.
[25:11.840 --> 25:14.800]  If you've got one 30 ton unit and it dies, you're fucked.
[25:14.800 --> 25:17.900]  The lights are going to turn off because it's a hundred degrees in there in no time.
[25:17.900 --> 25:20.240]  So that is my suggestion to you.
[25:20.240 --> 25:25.200]  Divide your HVAC into multiple units so that when one of your units fails, you've got a
[25:25.200 --> 25:26.820]  major backup plan.
[25:26.820 --> 25:30.420]  And trust me, your HVAC units will fail.
[25:30.420 --> 25:34.420]  That is my number one complaint in a commercial facility, the HVAC.
[25:34.420 --> 25:35.460]  It always takes a shit.
[25:35.460 --> 25:38.960]  There's always an HVAC issue somewhere that I've got to deal with.
[25:38.960 --> 25:40.340]  That is never a surprise.
[25:40.340 --> 25:44.660]  I know a lot of HVAC guys on a first name basis, I've got their name and number right
[25:44.660 --> 25:45.660]  on my phone.
[25:45.660 --> 25:46.940]  A lot of them are on speed dial.
[25:46.940 --> 25:50.340]  Siri is familiar with the HVAC crew.
[25:50.340 --> 25:53.100]  So really don't be a cheap ass when it comes to HVAC, you guys.
[25:53.100 --> 25:57.400]  If you're building a home grow, if you're building a commercial grow, I really recommend
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.380]  you get a good air conditioner and keep that room nice and cool.
[26:01.380 --> 26:06.500]  Your plants will be really happy if you get them in the low seventies or the high seventies,
[26:06.500 --> 26:07.500]  low eighties.
[26:07.500 --> 26:10.940]  They will really show you a difference from when you had them in the mid eighties.
[26:10.940 --> 26:16.620]  You'll see a huge difference in your production, the quality, the terpenes, the weight, everything
[26:16.620 --> 26:19.700]  will be better when you cool them down a little bit.
[26:19.700 --> 26:23.600]  So in a really small space, you're just going to have to use air exchange for cooling.
[26:23.600 --> 26:25.660]  That's not going to work in a larger space.
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.580]  You'll have to figure out air conditioning.
[26:27.580 --> 26:31.660]  If it's a window unit, if you're cutting a hole in the wall and creating a window for
[26:31.660 --> 26:34.900]  a window unit, that's always an option, but keep in mind, it's going to blow heat out
[26:34.900 --> 26:35.900]  the other side.
[26:35.900 --> 26:38.140]  So you're heating up the other side of that wall.
[26:38.140 --> 26:40.660]  Maybe you've got yourself one of those portable air conditioners.
[26:40.660 --> 26:42.380]  I really like those.
[26:42.380 --> 26:44.340]  That thing has a duct that goes outside.
[26:44.340 --> 26:48.060]  Do the same thing to that duct that I recommend you did to your light duct.
[26:48.060 --> 26:51.660]  Put a little pantyhose over it to work as a condom so that you don't get a mouse climbing
[26:51.660 --> 26:55.100]  up into that or a lizard climbing up into that when it's kind of cool outside and they
[26:55.100 --> 26:56.340]  feel that warm air coming out.
[26:56.340 --> 26:57.340]  They're like, that feels cozy.
[26:57.340 --> 27:01.480]  They just climb right up in there, put something over it to prevent that.
[27:01.480 --> 27:06.460]  Then once we move into a larger grow, you may need more window units or more portable
[27:06.460 --> 27:07.460]  ACs.
[27:07.460 --> 27:09.980]  And if those don't cut it, there's always the mini split option.
[27:09.980 --> 27:11.660]  I kind of skipped over the mini split.
[27:11.660 --> 27:16.440]  A mini split is a big unit that sits outside and then it runs conduit through the wall
[27:16.520 --> 27:18.920]  and the mini split hangs on the wall.
[27:18.920 --> 27:19.920]  You've seen them.
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.720]  It's about three feet long and it just looks like a vent on the wall and it is an air conditioner
[27:23.720 --> 27:24.720]  vent.
[27:24.720 --> 27:25.880]  That's part of a mini split.
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.280]  I think those run about 30,000 BTUs of cooling.
[27:29.280 --> 27:34.320]  So if you've got about eight to 10 lights, a mini split may be ideal and I'm sure they
[27:34.320 --> 27:36.520]  do make them in stronger models.
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.400]  So then we move up into an industrial grow and that's where we start recommending rooftop
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.400]  units.
[27:41.400 --> 27:49.200]  I'm going to recommend four to 6,000 BTUs of cooling per Govita or one half ton of cooling
[27:49.200 --> 27:50.360]  per Govita fixture.
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.200]  So for every two Govitas you hang, you do need one ton of cooling.
[27:54.200 --> 27:57.640]  All right, so now we know how to light the room and get it real hot.
[27:57.640 --> 28:00.200]  And now we've talked about a few ways to cool the room.
[28:00.200 --> 28:05.360]  Let's talk a little bit about airflow and odor control.
[28:05.360 --> 28:10.560]  If you decide to run ducted lights or if you decide to run an exhaust vent in your room
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.760]  to expel humidity or stale air every so often, I would highly recommend you add a carbon
[28:16.760 --> 28:19.400]  filter to that extraction fan.
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.200]  You don't need to send unfiltered air out of your grow.
[28:23.200 --> 28:29.640]  Most of the cannabis busts happening in my city are based on a neighbor complaining of
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.640]  odor.
[28:30.640 --> 28:32.960]  A neighbor says, hey, that smell is too strong.
[28:32.960 --> 28:34.680]  They decide which house it's coming from.
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.840]  They call the cops, the cops come, they knock on your door, they show up and knock.
[28:38.840 --> 28:41.920]  They say, hey, the neighbors say it smells too strongly of cannabis here.
[28:41.920 --> 28:43.120]  Do you have a grow?
[28:43.120 --> 28:44.800]  You either say yes or no.
[28:44.800 --> 28:45.880]  That's when they make their next move.
[28:45.880 --> 28:47.760]  If you say yes, they say, can we look?
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.160]  Then they come in and take a look.
[28:49.160 --> 28:52.640]  If you've got the right amount of plants, if you're not over your count, they high five
[28:52.640 --> 28:54.120]  you and they say, sorry to bug you.
[28:54.120 --> 28:56.080]  And they leave and they tell your neighbor, shut the fuck up.
[28:56.080 --> 28:58.000]  He's got enough plants and he's okay.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.760]  If you've got too many plants, shit goes wrong.
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.600]  That's when you probably say, no, you can't come in.
[29:02.600 --> 29:05.080]  That's when they go, yeah, because you've got too many plants, asshole.
[29:05.080 --> 29:07.120]  And then that's when things escalate.
[29:07.680 --> 29:09.960]  My point is odor control.
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.280]  Don't get yourself in trouble by growing stinky weed and advertising it to the neighborhood.
[29:15.280 --> 29:21.880]  Get a carbon filter, get the appropriate size, carbon filter and blower for your grow space.
[29:21.880 --> 29:22.880]  What's your goal?
[29:22.880 --> 29:25.680]  Are you blowing it over the lights to try to cool the lights?
[29:25.680 --> 29:30.760]  Are you also using that carbon filter blower and ducting system to pull air in through
[29:30.760 --> 29:33.480]  passive vents in that room while cooling those lights?
[29:33.480 --> 29:35.080]  Because yes, that will work for you.
[29:35.080 --> 29:37.720]  But at the same time, you're sucking your air conditioning cooling out of the room at
[29:37.720 --> 29:38.920]  the same time.
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.560]  But also my theory is that that air conditioning cooling is also helping cool the bulbs as
[29:42.560 --> 29:43.560]  it passes over there.
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.000]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.720]  That's kind of the way I have one gross setup.
[29:46.720 --> 29:50.000]  Anyway, do you need to move a whole bunch of air over lights?
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.760]  Do you need to move it a long distance or do you just need to run that air through a
[29:53.760 --> 29:57.000]  carbon filter and out of the room to get rid of excess humidity?
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.200]  And if you're going to do that, hang your carbon filter up as high as you can in the
[30:00.200 --> 30:01.200]  middle of the room.
[30:01.200 --> 30:02.200]  That's where the humidity is hidden.
[30:02.320 --> 30:05.800]  That's where I always recommend the carbon filter up high.
[30:05.800 --> 30:11.800]  But think about your use of that carbon filter and that blower and get the appropriate setup.
[30:11.800 --> 30:15.240]  If you've got a huge blower and a small filter, you're going to suck a whole bunch of air
[30:15.240 --> 30:18.440]  through a filter and it's not going to get filtered appropriately and you're going to
[30:18.440 --> 30:21.280]  blast that stank right to the neighborhood.
[30:21.280 --> 30:22.280]  Don't do that.
[30:22.280 --> 30:28.080]  So get the appropriate blower and carbon filter for anything that is going to exit your grow.
[30:28.080 --> 30:33.400]  I can recommend the fat filter and the fresh filter because I have used both of them.
[30:33.400 --> 30:35.080]  They are very similar.
[30:35.080 --> 30:36.560]  They both work very well for me.
[30:36.560 --> 30:39.560]  They both last about 18 to 24 months.
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.580]  I really didn't see a difference in either brand.
[30:42.580 --> 30:46.440]  So I only recommend them because I was satisfied with both of them.
[30:46.440 --> 30:50.680]  They were both affordable and they both did what I needed them to do.
[30:50.680 --> 30:52.760]  So that's odor control.
[30:52.760 --> 30:54.200]  Let's talk about intake.
[30:54.200 --> 30:56.680]  We're forcing a bunch of air out of this grow room.
[30:56.680 --> 30:59.600]  The air conditioner is going to send air out of the grow.
[30:59.600 --> 31:03.480]  We've probably got an extractor fan blowing humidity out of the grow.
[31:03.480 --> 31:06.580]  So now we need to replace some of that air.
[31:06.580 --> 31:08.720]  Are you going to do that through a passive vent?
[31:08.720 --> 31:12.600]  Are you going to use a powered fan to do that?
[31:12.600 --> 31:17.120]  Most of your small enclosures, your closets, and probably your small spare bedrooms are
[31:17.120 --> 31:22.840]  going to have enough passive vents to allow enough air to get into that room to replace
[31:22.840 --> 31:24.600]  that air we're pulling out.
[31:24.600 --> 31:26.760]  It'll probably come in through under the door.
[31:26.760 --> 31:28.880]  That's a lot more space than you realize.
[31:28.880 --> 31:33.400]  If you calculated that half inch gap by three feet, that's a lot of space.
[31:33.400 --> 31:35.240]  So a lot of air can flow through there.
[31:35.240 --> 31:38.520]  So we're replacing a lot of that air through there.
[31:38.520 --> 31:42.280]  If you want to replace the air much more quickly, you can make a hole.
[31:42.280 --> 31:45.160]  If you feel like you're getting a whistle from under that door and it's trying to pull
[31:45.160 --> 31:48.640]  the door off when the air conditioner comes on, if you've got pressure in there, or if
[31:48.640 --> 31:53.400]  it's trying to blow the door off one or the other, you may need to relieve some pressure
[31:53.400 --> 31:54.440]  one way or another.
[31:54.440 --> 31:56.360]  So a passive vent may be the way to go.
[31:56.360 --> 32:01.520]  Just start with a three inch hole or maybe a four inch hole somewhere low on the wall.
[32:01.520 --> 32:06.520]  I like to make my intake vents low and my outtake vents high because the lower air or
[32:06.520 --> 32:08.160]  the cooler air is lower.
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.040]  So just make a couple of holes.
[32:10.040 --> 32:13.160]  And of course you're going to have to make that light proof also.
[32:13.160 --> 32:17.520]  So think of a way to make it light proof and also maybe consider stapling one of those
[32:17.520 --> 32:23.160]  HEPA filters over it to prevent any bugs or anything from traveling from room to room.
[32:23.160 --> 32:24.960]  So a passive vent is really easy to do.
[32:24.960 --> 32:28.600]  I just put a dryer vent over it once I've made, I think it's a four inch hole fits perfectly
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.600]  for a dryer vent.
[32:29.600 --> 32:33.040]  So you can just put the little dryer vent over it and that way no light will shine through
[32:33.040 --> 32:34.040]  there.
[32:34.040 --> 32:37.000]  And it's also real low to the ground, so you don't have as much light risk coming in, but
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.120]  put it low to the ground, put the dryer vent over it and you'll be cool.
[32:39.120 --> 32:42.160]  That's a four inch passive vent into the room.
[32:42.160 --> 32:46.480]  So now when the air conditioner is blowing out all that stale air and while your exhaust
[32:46.480 --> 32:50.600]  fan is sucking out humidity up top, you've got some passive fresh air coming in through
[32:50.600 --> 32:52.120]  that hole in the wall.
[32:52.120 --> 32:54.240]  It doesn't take any electricity or equipment.
[32:54.240 --> 32:58.240]  Now if you really want to blast more air in there, get one of those squirrel cage fans,
[32:58.240 --> 33:00.620]  cut a hole in the wall, mount that squirrel cage fan in there.
[33:00.620 --> 33:04.360]  You can run ducting or however you want to do that and just blast more air in the room.
[33:04.360 --> 33:08.280]  If that's something you want to do, it's probably not necessary.
[33:08.280 --> 33:10.520]  Now let's talk a little bit about air flow.
[33:10.520 --> 33:13.580]  We do need to move the air around.
[33:13.580 --> 33:17.660]  We want air exchange and air flow in the room at all times.
[33:17.660 --> 33:21.200]  We don't need a giant tornado when they're beating our plants up, but we do need air
[33:21.200 --> 33:23.520]  movement constantly.
[33:23.520 --> 33:26.640]  In a small grow, I like to put one fan per light.
[33:26.640 --> 33:31.160]  So if you've got a small bedroom with four lights, why not hang up four fans?
[33:31.160 --> 33:32.520]  That way you get plenty of air flow.
[33:32.520 --> 33:34.000]  You don't get any hot spots in there.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.320]  In a larger grow, I understand that is not reasonable.
[33:37.320 --> 33:41.560]  It would not make any sense to hang a hundred fans in one room.
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.800]  I try to place a fan about every six to eight feet on the wall and depending on the height
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.720]  of my tables or my benches or my canopy, that decides where I place my fans.
[33:51.720 --> 33:53.880]  They're definitely lower than the lights.
[33:53.880 --> 33:57.960]  They'll be just between, hopefully they'll be between the lights and where the top of
[33:57.960 --> 33:59.440]  my canopy ends.
[33:59.440 --> 34:03.240]  So if I'm using gavitas, I've got a three foot space between the light and the top of
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.360]  the plants.
[34:04.360 --> 34:07.880]  Somewhere in that three foot space, that's probably where I would have my fans.
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.680]  Probably right at the bottom of that three foot space.
[34:09.680 --> 34:12.560]  You got gavitas, three feet and then a fan.
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.480]  In another environment, you're probably going to have a light and then maybe like a foot,
[34:16.520 --> 34:20.000]  maybe two and then your fans and then the top of your plants right there.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.360]  So that's where you want to hang your fans.
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.280]  In a small environment, like I said, about one fan per light.
[34:26.280 --> 34:28.240]  In a larger environment, I know that's not reasonable.
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.560]  You're going to want to go about one fan every six feet on the wall.
[34:32.560 --> 34:36.120]  And then if you can attach fans somewhere in the middle of the room to some poles or
[34:36.120 --> 34:38.220]  something that will always help.
[34:38.220 --> 34:39.400]  We just want air flow.
[34:39.400 --> 34:41.040]  We don't need to beat the plants to death.
[34:41.040 --> 34:42.560]  We don't need a hurricane in there.
[34:42.560 --> 34:43.960]  We just want to move that air around.
[34:43.960 --> 34:46.840]  We want to rustle the leaves nice and gently.
[34:46.840 --> 34:51.240]  Recently I discovered some fans that mount to the ceiling and they actually pull air
[34:51.240 --> 34:55.920]  from the ground up and they've got a louver that spreads the air outward.
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.240]  So the air comes from the ground up and then it spreads it across the ceiling and then
[35:00.240 --> 35:01.600]  that falls back down.
[35:01.600 --> 35:06.800]  I think those are great fans for any facility that is using CO2 augmentation.
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.000]  It'll bring that unused CO2 up off the floor and redistribute it back amongst the canopy.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.400]  And it also creates a lot of air flow in the grow without excessive wind.
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.200]  So look into those fans if you need more air flow in your garden.
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.120]  And of course if you're in a home grow, you can get those fans that are on a stand at
[35:23.120 --> 35:24.120]  Walmart.
[35:24.120 --> 35:25.680]  Just basic stand fans.
[35:25.680 --> 35:26.680]  Those work great.
[35:26.680 --> 35:28.920]  Buy them right at the start of winter when they go on sale.
[35:28.920 --> 35:30.880]  Go to Lowe's and clean them out because they'll be on sale.
[35:30.880 --> 35:32.860]  Don't try to buy your fans at the start of summer.
[35:32.860 --> 35:34.880]  Get them in the winter and they are on sale.
[35:34.880 --> 35:36.920]  In summer, they are sold out.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.440]  That's a grower trick.
[35:38.440 --> 35:41.520]  I also like to put fans low in the room.
[35:41.520 --> 35:44.800]  It wouldn't be odd to see a fan on the floor in my grow room.
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.040]  I buy those square box fans and just set one on the floor in the corner, blowing right
[35:49.040 --> 35:50.040]  toward the other corner.
[35:50.040 --> 35:54.520]  That's just going to help a little bit more airflow and airflow is always your friend.
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.800]  Also it will help if you spill some water.
[35:56.800 --> 36:00.920]  If you need the floor to dry, a fan is always your friend to help you dry up a spill.
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.120]  All right, now we've covered lighting.
[36:03.120 --> 36:06.520]  We have covered HVAC and cooling and airflow.
[36:06.520 --> 36:10.360]  Let's get into the next couple of details we should think about.
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.400]  Humidification and dehumidification, depending on your location, these may be crucial elements
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.760]  for your grow.
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.560]  In Colorado, we use both.
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.360]  I've talked about this a lot.
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.120]  We have days where it will be 95 and it will be hot and dry.
[36:25.120 --> 36:29.300]  And then in the night, it'll drop to the high 50s and it will rain.
[36:29.300 --> 36:34.560]  We use every piece of equipment in our HVAC arsenal in one day in a commercial grow in
[36:34.560 --> 36:35.560]  Colorado.
[36:35.600 --> 36:37.040]  We will use the heater in the morning.
[36:37.040 --> 36:39.560]  We will use the air conditioner all day.
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.120]  We will use the dehumidifier all night and we will use the humidifier all day.
[36:44.120 --> 36:46.160]  So think about those items.
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.640]  If you've got a small space, maybe you can get by with just a small humidifier like you
[36:50.640 --> 36:54.520]  would use for when you're sick or just to humidify the baby's bedroom or something like
[36:54.520 --> 36:55.520]  that.
[36:55.520 --> 36:59.280]  Just get a small one from Walmart and maybe that'll work for like a small tent or maybe
[36:59.280 --> 37:01.280]  a small bedroom grow.
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.520]  When you're moving into a bigger environment, you do need a larger industrial size, industrial
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.960]  use, humidifier or dehumidifier.
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.020]  I always say I don't like to recommend brands, but when you're entering into the commercial
[37:15.020 --> 37:20.480]  dehumidification game, I am of course going to recommend a Quest dehumidifier.
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.320]  The units on wheels are great.
[37:22.320 --> 37:25.280]  They are very expensive and very inefficient.
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.000]  The units that hang from the ceiling are what I would recommend.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.680]  I like to set my dehumidifier up on something like a Smartbee or a PL Grow unit and have
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.760]  something like that trigger it so that you can dial in that room perfectly.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.040]  Set the dehumidifier knob.
[37:39.040 --> 37:40.040]  It's got a knob on it.
[37:40.040 --> 37:41.600]  Turn that almost all the way up.
[37:41.600 --> 37:46.520]  Plug that into a trigger that is triggered by another monitoring device.
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.840]  And when you hit the appropriate humidity level, that thing will trigger on for you.
[37:50.840 --> 37:54.680]  I love setting up a dehumidifier on some sort of a triggering device.
[37:54.680 --> 37:57.080]  It keeps the rooms dialed in so well.
[37:57.080 --> 37:59.320]  You need some more to run that water off.
[37:59.320 --> 38:04.440]  A lot of people say you can use that water that's collected from a dehumidifier.
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.340]  I stopped doing it because after a while, the coils in that dehumidifier gather funk
[38:09.340 --> 38:11.560]  and that funk ends up in your water.
[38:11.560 --> 38:16.280]  Also, funky shit ends up in the tube that drains from the dehumidifier into whatever
[38:16.280 --> 38:17.280]  you're catching it in.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.800]  I've seen weird shit come out of that dehumidifier water.
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.000]  I don't know what it was.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  We stopped using it.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.920]  I found it to be unsafe.
[38:23.920 --> 38:29.400]  And like I said about your HVAC units, I would recommend buying multiple small dehumidifiers
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.400]  if your budget works for that instead of one large dehumidifier for when that dehumidifier
[38:34.400 --> 38:35.400]  breaks.
[38:35.400 --> 38:37.640]  Then you have a backup plan.
[38:37.640 --> 38:41.960]  You can still at least control the humidity a little bit with unit number two.
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.320]  Also make sure you keep the filters on your dehumidifiers clean.
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.880]  In a small unit or a large unit, it will make a huge difference.
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.940]  So my recommendation for humidification and dehumidification is to find a unit that is
[38:55.940 --> 39:02.000]  appropriate for the size space you are trying to humidify or dehumidify.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.240]  Find something that fits your budget.
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.200]  And don't worry too much about the controls on the unit as long as it's got an off and
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.600]  on we can plug it into something that will trigger it and that will help us dial in our
[39:12.600 --> 39:15.200]  humidity levels right where we want them.
[39:15.200 --> 39:19.180]  And if you want more guidance on humidity levels and vapor pressure deficit, I would
[39:19.180 --> 39:24.140]  recommend listening to the vapor pressure deficit episode that I did a while back.
[39:24.140 --> 39:29.780]  And that is episode 314, vapor pressure deficit, bug poops, and testing samples.
[39:29.780 --> 39:30.780]  Go check that one out.
[39:30.780 --> 39:33.220]  All right, you guys, I've been going for about 40 minutes.
[39:33.220 --> 39:38.660]  I feel like I have given you a lot of information to absorb when it comes to selecting equipment
[39:38.660 --> 39:40.080]  for your new grow.
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.980]  There are still a few details I would like to cover, but I think I'm going to save that
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.740]  for the next episode.
[39:45.740 --> 39:48.580]  And the next episode, we'll talk more about controllers.
[39:48.580 --> 39:49.980]  What are you going to plug everything into?
[39:49.980 --> 39:53.100]  What are we going to use to monitor the environment in your room?
[39:53.100 --> 39:58.560]  What are we going to use to trigger your humidifier, your fans, your dehumidifiers, your extraction
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.560]  fans?
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.780]  What are we going to use for that sort of stuff?
[40:00.780 --> 40:05.660]  We'll also talk about pots, soil, then we'll talk about nutrients, and then we will talk
[40:05.660 --> 40:11.180]  a little bit about integrated pest management and how all of these things need to work together.
[40:11.180 --> 40:12.980]  So I'm going to start wrapping up this episode.
[40:12.980 --> 40:18.020]  Make sure you join me for the next episode and we will continue this grow lesson.
