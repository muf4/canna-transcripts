[00:00.000 --> 00:18.440]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:18.440 --> 00:20.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:20.720 --> 00:26.120]  This is episode 762 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:26.120 --> 00:29.080]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a few listener emails.
[00:29.080 --> 00:32.520]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:32.520 --> 00:36.640]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:36.640 --> 00:39.240]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:39.240 --> 00:42.080]  Thank you shout out to my friend Girls Grow Too.
[00:42.080 --> 00:45.560]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Crafted Flower and Anvil Gardens.
[00:45.560 --> 00:48.680]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Levity Love Day and James Brown.
[00:48.680 --> 00:52.400]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Froggle Rock and Quazi.

[00:55.400 --> 00:58.200]  Let's send a big fist bump to G7 and Turt Burglar.
[00:58.200 --> 01:01.160]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01.160 --> 01:04.200]  Thank you shout out to my buddy Kes Burton.
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.000]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:26.720 --> 01:30.700]  of my friends to support the show on Patreon.

[01:35.840 --> 01:38.560]  That's right July 30th in Fort Collins Colorado.
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.120]  The Dude Grows crew is hosting the Growers Cup.
[01:41.120 --> 01:43.120]  I do invite you to join us.
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.440]  Team Iry Genetics, the Dude Grows crew and a bunch of members of the community will be there.
[01:47.440 --> 01:49.140]  I look forward to joining you.
[01:49.140 --> 01:53.640]  For all of the info do check out dudegrows.com.
[01:53.640 --> 01:56.600]  Alright I said I was going to answer a few listener emails on this episode.
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.400]  Let's not waste a lot of time.
[01:58.400 --> 02:00.720]  This first message came from our friend on Patreon.
[02:00.720 --> 02:02.320]  Big shout out to my buddy Kip.
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.480]  This one says yo Rasta Jeff I hope you're having a great Monday.
[02:05.480 --> 02:06.480]  It is a beautiful day.
[02:06.480 --> 02:08.440]  It is super hot but I'm adjusting.
[02:08.440 --> 02:11.520]  I apologize if you do hear the air conditioner in the background.
[02:11.520 --> 02:12.520]  I'm not turning it off.
[02:12.520 --> 02:13.520]  It's hot.
[02:13.520 --> 02:14.680]  We're going to keep that thing flowing.
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.920]  Anyway it says I just received my Iry Direct order and I noticed an extra 10 pack of seeds.
[02:20.920 --> 02:23.440]  So our friend has discovered the Iry Direct page.
[02:23.440 --> 02:27.280]  If you go to irygenetics.com you will see the tab that says Iry Direct.
[02:27.280 --> 02:28.280]  Make sure you check that out.
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.080]  Our friend has seen that link and it says I received my order and received an extra 10
[02:32.080 --> 02:33.080]  pack of seeds.
[02:33.080 --> 02:37.760]  So you said on a recent podcast that you do occasionally send out testers but I just wanted
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.680]  to make sure I didn't get a whole extra pack by mistake.
[02:41.680 --> 02:45.720]  You are correct I do send out testers but I make sure that people know they are getting
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.720]  testers.
[02:46.720 --> 02:48.540]  I make sure they can run them right away that they are prepared.
[02:48.540 --> 02:49.540]  We have a conversation.
[02:49.540 --> 02:51.800]  What you got my friend was a gift.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.760]  I know that people work hard for their money.
[02:53.760 --> 02:55.760]  I know that money is expensive.
[02:55.760 --> 02:58.720]  The only way to get money is by putting in your time, your effort and your energy.
[02:58.720 --> 03:00.480]  We don't have a lot of time.
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.620]  We're bombarded by life as humans.
[03:02.660 --> 03:05.540]  So I understand that you work really hard for your money and when you buy seeds from
[03:05.540 --> 03:07.220]  me I appreciate it.
[03:07.220 --> 03:12.060]  To show everybody their thank you and their appreciation for buying seeds I make sure
[03:12.060 --> 03:14.980]  to include some freebies with every single order.
[03:14.980 --> 03:18.140]  So those were a gift to you from me to say hey thank you.
[03:18.140 --> 03:19.540]  You didn't have to buy seeds from me.
[03:19.540 --> 03:22.500]  You could have bought from hundreds of other seed makers.
[03:22.500 --> 03:25.700]  I'm sure there are thousands of seed makers out there that you could have chosen to give
[03:25.700 --> 03:29.660]  your money and I appreciate that you chose to send your money my direction.
[03:29.660 --> 03:30.860]  So to say thank you my friend.
[03:30.860 --> 03:32.540]  You got 10 extra seeds.
[03:32.540 --> 03:34.480]  I do appreciate you noticing.
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.860]  Thank you for asking.
[03:35.860 --> 03:36.860]  Enjoy them.
[03:36.860 --> 03:39.240]  If you don't have room to grow them now send them to a friend.
[03:39.240 --> 03:40.240]  Grow them next time.
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.240]  They're extras.
[03:41.240 --> 03:42.240]  They're yours.
[03:42.240 --> 03:43.240]  They're a gift.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.240]  Thank you bro.
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.240]  I do appreciate your support.
[03:45.240 --> 03:48.820]  All right anybody else out there if you do get extra beans in your order have no fear.
[03:48.820 --> 03:49.820]  Those are yours.
[03:49.820 --> 03:50.820]  You can grow them.
[03:50.820 --> 03:51.900]  You can share them with a friend.
[03:51.900 --> 03:54.980]  Like I said if you don't have space or time to grow them right now share them with the
[03:54.980 --> 03:55.980]  grower in need.
[03:55.980 --> 03:58.420]  If you know somebody that needs some beans pass them out.
[03:58.420 --> 03:59.420]  Spread the love.
[03:59.460 --> 04:02.100]  And by the time you order seeds from me the karma will probably double up.
[04:02.100 --> 04:04.580]  It will work out in your favor.
[04:04.580 --> 04:07.500]  All right this next question does come from the YouTube channel.
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.140]  It is a comment left on a video.
[04:09.140 --> 04:13.180]  I don't usually take questions from the YouTube but this one looks like a good thing I should
[04:13.180 --> 04:14.180]  mention.
[04:14.180 --> 04:15.660]  I could ramble about for a couple of seconds.
[04:15.660 --> 04:18.100]  It comes from our buddy Local Grow Guy.
[04:18.100 --> 04:19.100]  What's up Local Grow Guy.
[04:19.100 --> 04:21.120]  I hope you see this episode of the show.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.880]  It says great show brother.
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.880]  Much respect.
[04:23.880 --> 04:26.180]  You need to do a live Q&A show.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.540]  YouTube followers would love it.
[04:27.540 --> 04:28.780]  Just a thought.
[04:28.780 --> 04:29.780]  Just a thought.
[04:29.780 --> 04:31.580]  Much love and stay safe.
[04:31.580 --> 04:33.660]  That is a really good message.
[04:33.660 --> 04:37.780]  My answer is I do a live show every Monday on Instagram.
[04:37.780 --> 04:42.180]  Every Monday around 7 10 p.m. mountain time.
[04:42.180 --> 04:43.180]  I'm in Colorado.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.340]  I go live mountain time.
[04:44.340 --> 04:46.300]  I don't know what time zone you are in.
[04:46.300 --> 04:47.480]  I'm in mountain time.
[04:47.480 --> 04:50.180]  So every Monday approximately 7 10.
[04:50.180 --> 04:51.180]  It could be 7 0 5.
[04:51.180 --> 04:53.020]  It could be 7 15.
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.500]  Sometimes the internet gives me some trouble.
[04:54.500 --> 04:56.340]  I usually get there as quickly as I can.
[04:56.340 --> 04:57.340]  I go live.
[04:57.340 --> 04:58.340]  I take dabs.
[04:58.340 --> 04:59.340]  I hang out.
[04:59.340 --> 05:00.340]  I answer questions.
[05:00.340 --> 05:01.340]  And everybody in the Instagram is able to type in and ask me questions.
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.340]  I do my best to answer every single question that comes in through the Instagram live.
[05:02.340 --> 05:03.340]  And honestly some of my favorite questions get written down and recycled and I do make
[05:03.340 --> 05:04.340]  a full podcast out of them.
[05:04.340 --> 05:05.340]  Because I don't feel I don't I'm not prepared on the live show.
[05:05.340 --> 05:06.340]  It's like stump the grower.
[05:06.340 --> 05:07.340]  People can ask me whatever they want.
[05:07.340 --> 05:08.340]  So people ask a lot of random crazy questions.
[05:08.340 --> 05:09.340]  Ask grow question.
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.340]  Music questions.
[05:10.340 --> 05:11.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:11.340 --> 05:12.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:12.340 --> 05:13.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:13.340 --> 05:14.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:14.340 --> 05:15.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:15.340 --> 05:16.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:18.340 --> 05:19.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:19.340 --> 05:20.340]  I'm not prepared.
[05:50.940 --> 06:08.160]  So join us Monday on Instagram the Instagram is IRI underscore genetics IR IE underscore
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.340]  genetics that is me on Instagram.
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.340]  Follow me on Instagram.
[06:11.340 --> 06:14.660]  Look for the notification on Monday around 7 10 p.m.
[06:14.660 --> 06:15.700]  I will go live.
[06:15.700 --> 06:20.080]  We will hang out you'll be able to type in all of your grow questions your random questions
[06:20.080 --> 06:21.920]  and a couple of cold beverages,
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.360]  and we just hang out and get lit,
[06:23.360 --> 06:26.160]  and I try to answer the questions as quickly as possible,
[06:26.160 --> 06:28.640]  as accurately and thoroughly as possible,
[06:28.640 --> 06:30.740]  without any preparation, any study.
[06:30.740 --> 06:32.800]  So that keeps it fun, that keeps me on my toes,
[06:32.800 --> 06:34.200]  keeps my brain active.
[06:34.200 --> 06:36.300]  Also a good time to just kind of hang out with the crew
[06:36.300 --> 06:38.200]  and take some dabs and talk some shit.
[06:38.200 --> 06:39.400]  All right, I do have another question
[06:39.400 --> 06:40.240]  right here in front of me.
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.320]  This one came from Patreon.
[06:42.320 --> 06:44.560]  This comes from our buddy who calls himself,
[06:44.560 --> 06:45.920]  F a plant count, bro.
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.160]  I know what you mean.
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.960]  F your plant count, that's how I feel.
[06:49.960 --> 06:51.720]  Let me do what I need to do.
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.120]  Although I do have to follow the rules
[06:53.120 --> 06:55.440]  because everybody knows who I am by now.
[06:55.440 --> 06:57.120]  Anyway, this message came from Patreon.
[06:57.120 --> 06:58.320]  Shout out to the Patreon crew.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.960]  It goes a lot like this.
[06:59.960 --> 07:01.760]  Yo, Rasta Jeff, what's up my brother?
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.720]  I hope everything is iry, bro.
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.200]  Things are pretty good.
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.960]  It's 100 and something degrees outside,
[07:06.960 --> 07:08.200]  and it is nice and cool in here.
[07:08.200 --> 07:09.860]  I got a frosty cold beverage in front of me.
[07:09.860 --> 07:11.880]  I took a few fat dabs.
[07:11.880 --> 07:15.080]  Shout out to my friend who teleported me,
[07:15.080 --> 07:17.560]  manifested somehow, the Lemon Jeffrey dabs.
[07:17.560 --> 07:19.040]  That shit is great.
[07:19.080 --> 07:19.920]  You know who you are, bro.
[07:19.920 --> 07:21.120]  I just don't want to, you know.
[07:21.120 --> 07:22.760]  Anyway, we're alive here on the show.
[07:22.760 --> 07:24.920]  It says, thank you for answering my last question
[07:24.920 --> 07:26.400]  about reversing a male.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.740]  I really appreciate it.
[07:27.740 --> 07:29.120]  I've grown a few dozen strains,
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.960]  but I'm coming across an anomaly
[07:30.960 --> 07:32.360]  which I've never seen before.
[07:32.360 --> 07:33.360]  Those are my favorites.
[07:33.360 --> 07:34.620]  I love anomalies.
[07:34.620 --> 07:35.460]  All right, it goes on.
[07:35.460 --> 07:39.000]  It says, I am growing end game RBX punchline by Ethos.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.840]  That is a very creative, long name.
[07:41.840 --> 07:43.520]  It says, I've come across a phenotype
[07:43.520 --> 07:46.060]  that virtually does not pistol out.
[07:46.060 --> 07:47.480]  So it's not making any of the things
[07:47.480 --> 07:48.800]  that you guys call hairs,
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.220]  which are the breeding parts of the female plant.
[07:51.220 --> 07:54.480]  It is not making any of those, which is kind of rare.
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.380]  It says, both phenos I have through very little pistols
[07:57.380 --> 07:58.440]  in the stretch phase.
[07:58.440 --> 08:01.600]  Now at day 50, one house beautiful, dense,
[08:01.600 --> 08:03.560]  hairless nugs top to bottom,
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.280]  and stinks like Swedish fish and Hubba Bubba gum
[08:07.280 --> 08:08.280]  had an orgy.
[08:08.280 --> 08:11.240]  So if we took some Swedish fish, Hubba Bubba gum,
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.780]  and we had an orgy with them,
[08:12.780 --> 08:14.160]  that's what this plant would smell like.
[08:14.160 --> 08:16.000]  That doesn't sound too bad in my mind.
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.120]  Smells kind of sweet and juicy.
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.920]  I enjoy that smell.
[08:18.920 --> 08:19.760]  He does go on.
[08:19.760 --> 08:22.840]  It says, the other plant has hairless main colas.
[08:22.840 --> 08:26.240]  All the lower golf balls got pistols late and flower.
[08:26.240 --> 08:27.760]  I spoke with other people growing this,
[08:27.760 --> 08:29.280]  and it seems to be common.
[08:29.280 --> 08:31.820]  I remember you mentioning some wonky things happen
[08:31.820 --> 08:33.660]  after a few reversals down the line,
[08:33.660 --> 08:36.880]  and I can count at least three or four that went into these.
[08:36.880 --> 08:38.980]  Is this a mutation that comes from reversals?
[08:38.980 --> 08:40.820]  I don't know that it's a mutation.
[08:40.820 --> 08:43.560]  It could just be a trait maybe, just a,
[08:43.560 --> 08:45.120]  I don't know necessarily it's a mutation
[08:45.120 --> 08:48.120]  because I don't have the qualification to identify
[08:48.120 --> 08:51.960]  that that is a definition of a mutation.
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.240]  It is definitely a trait that we're noticing,
[08:54.240 --> 08:57.160]  and it's a commonality if a lot of people are getting it.
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.100]  It goes on, it says,
[08:59.100 --> 09:01.200]  do you think these plants would be sterile?
[09:01.200 --> 09:04.660]  I would assume so, but I have no way of being certain.
[09:04.660 --> 09:05.500]  I'm gonna keep going.
[09:05.500 --> 09:07.240]  It says, I took three clones of the hairless girl
[09:07.240 --> 09:08.760]  and put them outdoors.
[09:08.760 --> 09:10.540]  I already assume putting them outside
[09:10.540 --> 09:12.720]  may give them a different phenotypical expression.
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.000]  You may see a lot different stuff.
[09:14.000 --> 09:14.840]  You may not.
[09:15.560 --> 09:17.720]  It says, but I figured no pistols, no pollination,
[09:17.720 --> 09:20.000]  and I would have to worry less about my outdoor crop
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.440]  being pollinated by a careless neighbor or something.
[09:22.440 --> 09:25.720]  That is a really great idea, a really great assumption,
[09:25.720 --> 09:27.120]  a really great hope,
[09:27.120 --> 09:29.760]  but I would take one of those plants and put it indoors
[09:29.760 --> 09:31.840]  and attempt to pollinate it just once
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.840]  just to see what happens.
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.320]  Being the highly inquisitive, curious person
[09:37.320 --> 09:39.640]  that wants to know, I just wanna know what if,
[09:39.640 --> 09:41.320]  I would take that pistol-less plant
[09:41.320 --> 09:43.280]  and I would put it in a room with a male plant
[09:43.280 --> 09:44.600]  and I would just put some pollen on it,
[09:45.360 --> 09:47.120]  or I've always got some pollen in a fridge or in a freezer.
[09:47.120 --> 09:48.160]  I'd grab some of that pollen
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.120]  and just dust a couple of plants with that
[09:50.120 --> 09:52.240]  or a couple of clones of this plant with that
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.600]  and see what happened
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.440]  and see if you can make any seeds out of it.
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.320]  Then you would know that those are sterile or not,
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.360]  but your assumption is great.
[09:59.360 --> 10:01.940]  That plant will probably not take pollen as well,
[10:01.940 --> 10:03.960]  probably make fewer seeds.
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.560]  That could be a really good plant for you.
[10:05.560 --> 10:08.200]  The problem is how do you get more seeds of that?
[10:08.200 --> 10:10.120]  You've gotta keep cloning it or make a bunch of clones
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.100]  is the only way that one carries.
[10:12.100 --> 10:13.640]  That is the end game.
[10:13.720 --> 10:15.760]  There's something that we used to hear about,
[10:15.760 --> 10:17.240]  wow, this is old cannabis lore.
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.240]  I didn't mean to talk about this.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.120]  How long have I been going?
[10:19.120 --> 10:21.160]  All right, we're gonna get off on a side right here.
[10:21.160 --> 10:23.000]  There's a thing that they talk about back in the day
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.140]  that is known as the terminator gene,
[10:25.140 --> 10:27.100]  which was bred into plants.
[10:27.100 --> 10:28.240]  So I don't do this.
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.700]  I don't know how to do this, honestly.
[10:29.700 --> 10:31.280]  If I read up on it, I could figure it out.
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.640]  It's not something I want to do.
[10:33.640 --> 10:36.040]  Some breeders, A breeders, some more along the line
[10:36.040 --> 10:37.960]  discovered how to breed plants
[10:37.960 --> 10:40.160]  and breed what is called the terminator gene into it.
[10:40.160 --> 10:43.060]  If you breed certain filial generations into each other,
[10:43.060 --> 10:45.220]  you can create sterile plants basically.
[10:45.220 --> 10:47.180]  And I don't know exactly how to do it,
[10:47.180 --> 10:50.100]  but I think it's an octoploid or from what I,
[10:50.100 --> 10:51.340]  I've spent so long since I read it,
[10:51.340 --> 10:52.740]  I'm not gonna ramble and get it wrong,
[10:52.740 --> 10:54.900]  but there is the terminator gene
[10:54.900 --> 10:56.720]  where you can breed it to where the plants
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.940]  actually do not make any more seeds.
[10:58.940 --> 10:59.780]  They just stop.
[10:59.780 --> 11:00.660]  They are not fertile plants.
[11:00.660 --> 11:02.500]  You'll get males that'll kick out pollen,
[11:02.500 --> 11:04.660]  but the females do not take any pollen.
[11:04.660 --> 11:05.700]  They don't make pistils.
[11:05.700 --> 11:06.780]  They cannot get pollinated.
[11:06.780 --> 11:07.620]  They're sterile.
[11:07.620 --> 11:08.740]  They're non-fertile is the word my brain
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.340]  is searching for as I ramble.
[11:10.340 --> 11:11.580]  So it is possible.
[11:11.580 --> 11:13.940]  I'm not making any assumptions or accusations.
[11:13.940 --> 11:15.500]  I am saying it as an option
[11:15.500 --> 11:18.180]  that maybe our friend has bred in the terminator gene
[11:18.180 --> 11:20.340]  by accident here, or it just popped up,
[11:20.340 --> 11:22.100]  or maybe these plants will breed completely.
[11:22.100 --> 11:23.740]  We have no evidence of either direction,
[11:23.740 --> 11:25.740]  but these are all possibilities.
[11:25.740 --> 11:28.380]  Let me make sure I got to the bottom of this message.
[11:28.380 --> 11:31.340]  It says, I can't wait to pop your wombat fems
[11:31.340 --> 11:32.280]  in a couple of weeks.
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.460]  Thanks for your time.
[11:33.460 --> 11:38.380]  Much love from our friend who calls themselves Joe Giz.
[11:38.380 --> 11:40.060]  You're doing so great till that part, bro.
[11:40.060 --> 11:40.900]  No, I'm just kidding.
[11:40.900 --> 11:41.900]  It's a creative name.
[11:41.900 --> 11:44.380]  I think you do have the great assumption
[11:44.380 --> 11:48.180]  that since these plants have fewer pistils than most plants
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.940]  that they won't receive pollen,
[11:49.940 --> 11:52.500]  but I would hate to find out the wrong way.
[11:52.500 --> 11:54.860]  That would definitely be the way to make an ass
[11:54.860 --> 11:56.820]  of you and me.
[11:56.820 --> 11:59.380]  So maybe put it indoors, hit it with some pollen,
[11:59.380 --> 12:01.300]  see what it does, then put it outside.
[12:01.300 --> 12:02.300]  Sounds like you've already done it.
[12:02.300 --> 12:04.220]  So we're going to put it to the true test.
[12:04.220 --> 12:05.660]  If any of your neighbors are out there
[12:05.660 --> 12:08.100]  with some stray pollen, that plant will get it.
[12:08.100 --> 12:10.100]  If it makes seeds, then it makes seeds.
[12:10.100 --> 12:11.260]  That's the only way to find out though,
[12:11.260 --> 12:13.620]  is to pollinate that bitch and to find out.
[12:13.620 --> 12:15.200]  Dude, thank you for the great message.
[12:15.200 --> 12:17.180]  Thank you for letting me talk about the Terminator gene
[12:17.180 --> 12:18.020]  on accident.
[12:18.020 --> 12:19.620]  I had forgotten all about that.
[12:19.620 --> 12:20.660]  I will do more research.
[12:20.660 --> 12:21.900]  Maybe you guys remind me.
[12:21.900 --> 12:23.480]  I'll try to do a show that involves more
[12:23.480 --> 12:25.820]  of the Terminator gene.
[12:25.820 --> 12:28.540]  All right, this next message does come from Patreon.
[12:28.540 --> 12:30.060]  Big shout out to the Patreon crew.
[12:30.060 --> 12:33.700]  Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[12:33.700 --> 12:35.500]  This one comes from our friend A-Ron
[12:35.500 --> 12:37.380]  and it goes just like this.
[12:37.380 --> 12:40.040]  It says, how about an in-depth conversation
[12:40.980 --> 12:42.320]  about getting into the cannabis industry?
[12:42.320 --> 12:45.420]  That is a very good topic that we can talk about.
[12:45.420 --> 12:47.900]  What I'm going to cover is what I know.
[12:47.900 --> 12:50.720]  I know how to get into the, basically the legal,
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.100]  what I'm going to cover today is getting
[12:52.100 --> 12:55.800]  into the legal Colorado cannabis industry,
[12:55.800 --> 12:57.820]  the marijuana enforcement division
[12:57.820 --> 13:00.560]  regulated legal cannabis industry,
[13:00.560 --> 13:03.760]  the big grows that produce legal cannabis
[13:03.760 --> 13:05.840]  for the legal dispensaries.
[13:05.840 --> 13:07.440]  That's what I'm going to focus on today
[13:07.440 --> 13:09.440]  because any other cannabis business
[13:09.840 --> 13:11.240]  that you're getting into the industry,
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.520]  you have to kind of find your niche.
[13:12.520 --> 13:15.440]  It doesn't, I didn't mean to even do this
[13:15.440 --> 13:17.280]  when I started this brand, this seed company.
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.060]  I think I invented this on my own on accident.
[13:20.060 --> 13:22.120]  I made seeds, people wanted them.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.180]  I sold some of them, people wanted more.
[13:24.180 --> 13:25.080]  It just kind of snowballed.
[13:25.080 --> 13:26.400]  Eventually I had a seed company.
[13:26.400 --> 13:28.160]  I was breeding out of passion.
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.200]  So if you're doing something you're passionate about
[13:30.200 --> 13:32.840]  that you can turn into a business, do that.
[13:32.840 --> 13:35.560]  If you're doing something that is ancillary of cannabis
[13:35.560 --> 13:38.040]  that you can cater to this industry, do that.
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.200]  One thing I'm going to say before I jump into talking
[13:40.200 --> 13:41.960]  about creating your own cannabis
[13:41.960 --> 13:44.480]  or what I'm going to focus on here is the legal side
[13:44.480 --> 13:47.840]  of the industry is don't turn your passion,
[13:47.840 --> 13:50.080]  your favorite thing into a career
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.200]  that could possibly burn out your passion
[13:52.200 --> 13:55.240]  for whatever that subject is.
[13:55.240 --> 13:57.120]  I used to be in the music industry.
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.600]  I'm not hyping it up.
[13:58.600 --> 13:59.420]  I'm not bragging.
[13:59.420 --> 14:01.040]  This is just a story here for you.
[14:01.040 --> 14:02.980]  I used to play music professionally.
[14:02.980 --> 14:04.480]  I've been around the country playing the drums
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.320]  with several bands.
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.880]  I've been on a lot of big stages,
[14:06.920 --> 14:08.400]  been on even more small stages,
[14:08.400 --> 14:11.560]  been in a lot of tiny shit clubs playing little tiny shows.
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.160]  But I've been all over the place playing music.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.860]  I've been all over making money.
[14:14.860 --> 14:15.700]  That was my career.
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.180]  Playing drums was my job.
[14:17.180 --> 14:18.920]  That's what I did five nights a week.
[14:18.920 --> 14:20.880]  That's how I paid the bills, how I paid the rent,
[14:20.880 --> 14:22.940]  how things worked out for me.
[14:22.940 --> 14:24.840]  I also worked at Guitar Center for a little while.
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.000]  I was a department manager,
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.280]  obviously a drum department manager at Guitar Center.
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.040]  Those two things combined kind of burnt me out
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.140]  on the desire to be around and involved in music.
[14:37.140 --> 14:40.000]  There was a time when I would leave my job at Guitar Center
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.700]  and most people when you get out of work,
[14:41.700 --> 14:43.340]  you probably walk out to the car,
[14:43.340 --> 14:45.160]  you get to the car, you sit down and do that,
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.600]  oh, I'm fucking off work thing.
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.400]  You check your phone and you crank up some music
[14:48.400 --> 14:50.280]  and get on the road, right?
[14:50.280 --> 14:51.320]  That wasn't me.
[14:51.320 --> 14:53.000]  I would get in the car and hit the pipe
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.080]  as hard as I fucking could
[14:54.080 --> 14:55.200]  because I wanted to get super stoned
[14:55.200 --> 14:58.140]  and get all the terrible guitar sounds out of my head.
[14:58.140 --> 15:00.000]  I don't want to hear the intro to Enter Sandman.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.340]  I don't want to hear fucking Back in Black anymore.
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.620]  I don't want to hear Stairway to Heaven.
[15:03.620 --> 15:05.380]  I've been hearing it all day long
[15:05.380 --> 15:06.800]  and it was just driving me crazy.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.060]  So I'd get in the car and turn the music off
[15:09.060 --> 15:10.380]  and try to get as stoned as I could
[15:10.380 --> 15:12.580]  where I didn't hear music anymore.
[15:12.580 --> 15:14.900]  So it was kind of, and then going on tour,
[15:14.900 --> 15:17.540]  it wasn't fun to be like, well, we've got to play this gig,
[15:17.540 --> 15:19.040]  but then we can't have any fun
[15:19.040 --> 15:19.980]  because as soon as we're done,
[15:19.980 --> 15:21.620]  we got to get the gear off the stage
[15:21.620 --> 15:23.260]  and get in the van and get to the next city
[15:23.260 --> 15:24.200]  because we don't have,
[15:24.200 --> 15:26.180]  we got to play in 12 hours in another city
[15:26.180 --> 15:28.260]  and we don't even have that much time to drive there.
[15:28.260 --> 15:30.060]  It would just get hectic, maybe not 12 hours,
[15:30.060 --> 15:30.900]  but you see what I'm saying?
[15:30.900 --> 15:33.580]  It would burn you out to where playing the drums was more,
[15:33.580 --> 15:35.260]  it became work, it wasn't fun.
[15:35.260 --> 15:37.380]  Now that I don't have to show up for a gig
[15:37.380 --> 15:38.380]  and play at a certain time
[15:38.380 --> 15:39.620]  when I do get to beat on the drums,
[15:39.620 --> 15:41.900]  it is so joyous, it is so much fun.
[15:41.900 --> 15:44.340]  My point here, what I'm rambling forever about
[15:44.340 --> 15:46.420]  is don't turn your cannabis career
[15:46.420 --> 15:48.340]  into what I did with music.
[15:48.340 --> 15:49.300]  Some, there was a while
[15:49.300 --> 15:50.700]  when I didn't want to go to a concert.
[15:50.700 --> 15:52.620]  I didn't want to go see live music
[15:52.620 --> 15:53.700]  because it just felt like work.
[15:53.700 --> 15:55.660]  I was like, I'd rather just miss this show
[15:55.660 --> 15:57.620]  and let myself start to miss music again.
[15:57.620 --> 15:59.140]  Now I'm passionate about music again,
[15:59.140 --> 16:03.420]  but don't let this happen to you with cannabis.
[16:03.420 --> 16:06.020]  Don't uproot your whole life to move to another state
[16:06.020 --> 16:07.340]  to get a job as a trimmer
[16:07.340 --> 16:09.340]  because you think it's gonna change your whole life.
[16:09.340 --> 16:11.620]  Being a trimmer or being a grow tech
[16:11.620 --> 16:14.020]  or being a dispensary bud tender,
[16:14.020 --> 16:15.820]  it could ruin your passion for cannabis.
[16:15.820 --> 16:17.640]  You're gonna have hours, you're gonna have goals,
[16:17.640 --> 16:18.780]  you're gonna have expectations,
[16:18.780 --> 16:21.100]  you're gonna have bosses around cannabis.
[16:21.100 --> 16:23.500]  And do you want to associate one of your favorite things
[16:23.500 --> 16:26.660]  with work, with stress, with a paycheck, with a headache,
[16:26.660 --> 16:28.600]  with bad customers, with a terrible boss,
[16:28.600 --> 16:30.540]  with deadlines, expectations?
[16:30.540 --> 16:32.700]  Do you want to put that on your favorite thing?
[16:32.700 --> 16:33.860]  That is my advice to you.
[16:33.860 --> 16:35.980]  Luckily, fortunately, beautifully,
[16:35.980 --> 16:38.620]  I've established a beautiful career,
[16:38.620 --> 16:41.080]  a place in this industry to where I love it.
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.660]  I cannot get burnt out on this.
[16:42.660 --> 16:43.620]  I am passionate about it.
[16:43.620 --> 16:46.060]  I wake up thinking about growing and smoking
[16:46.060 --> 16:47.020]  and consuming cannabis
[16:47.020 --> 16:49.080]  and teaching you guys how to grow better herb.
[16:49.080 --> 16:51.820]  So make sure that you don't put yourself in a position
[16:51.820 --> 16:55.040]  where you're going to hate your life, your career,
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.760]  your location and the plant
[16:57.760 --> 16:59.680]  because you wanted to combine all of those things
[16:59.680 --> 17:00.640]  into one thing.
[17:00.640 --> 17:04.420]  Keep some space, separation of plant and state,
[17:04.420 --> 17:05.760]  I guess, if you will.
[17:05.760 --> 17:07.520]  All right, now let's talk more about the email,
[17:07.520 --> 17:08.800]  the shit that I did write down.
[17:08.800 --> 17:10.440]  If you want to get into the legal
[17:10.440 --> 17:12.040]  marijuana enforcement division,
[17:12.040 --> 17:14.960]  regulated legal cannabis industry here in Colorado,
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.000]  the first thing you have to do is, do you qualify?
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.320]  There's a checklist of things
[17:19.320 --> 17:21.760]  on the marijuana enforcement division.
[17:21.760 --> 17:23.600]  Can I get my badge checklist?
[17:23.600 --> 17:24.760]  There's a website you will go to.
[17:25.480 --> 17:26.300]  I should have written that down.
[17:26.300 --> 17:27.140]  I didn't.
[17:27.140 --> 17:29.000]  You're going to have to do some of the work on your own.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.600]  There's a website, marijuana enforcement division.
[17:31.600 --> 17:33.560]  You will see if you qualify to even get
[17:33.560 --> 17:36.480]  a marijuana enforcement division workers badge.
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.960]  There'll be a few questions.
[17:37.960 --> 17:40.560]  Have you had any felonies within the past few years?
[17:41.500 --> 17:43.040]  I don't remember the exact questions
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.760]  and I'm not going to ask all of them right now.
[17:44.760 --> 17:46.000]  There's a questionnaire.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.540]  You have to find out if you qualify.
[17:47.540 --> 17:49.800]  If you've done some things that they find unacceptable
[17:49.800 --> 17:51.320]  or that you may need to correct,
[17:51.320 --> 17:53.360]  you do not qualify for the badge at this time,
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.920]  which means you shouldn't pack up and move to Colorado
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.280]  and try to get a weed industry job
[17:57.280 --> 17:59.440]  because you can't even get the badge.
[17:59.440 --> 18:01.360]  Before you even think about coming here,
[18:01.360 --> 18:03.360]  before you think about applying for a job,
[18:03.360 --> 18:05.040]  see if you qualify for that badge.
[18:05.040 --> 18:07.200]  If you can't come here, check other states.
[18:07.200 --> 18:09.040]  There are so many other states developing
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.300]  cannabis industries.
[18:10.300 --> 18:11.680]  This isn't the only place to go,
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.160]  but this is where I know the rules, the process,
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.000]  and the steps.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.360]  It's what I can talk about.
[18:16.360 --> 18:18.780]  So do you qualify for the badge?
[18:18.780 --> 18:19.620]  Do you?
[18:19.620 --> 18:20.460]  Maybe, I don't know.
[18:20.460 --> 18:23.080]  If you do, get all of the required paperwork,
[18:23.920 --> 18:26.960]  it costs money to get it, get the money together,
[18:26.960 --> 18:28.220]  then apply for the badge.
[18:28.220 --> 18:30.440]  You may have to come all the way to Colorado
[18:30.440 --> 18:32.280]  just to apply for the badge.
[18:32.280 --> 18:34.200]  So when you come here to apply for that badge,
[18:34.200 --> 18:37.840]  I recommend you visit where you're going.
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.600]  I've got a friend who is on our Patreon
[18:39.600 --> 18:40.760]  who listens to the podcast.
[18:40.760 --> 18:41.600]  What's up, bro?
[18:41.600 --> 18:43.200]  Hope you're well, hope you're safe.
[18:43.200 --> 18:45.920]  That person decided that after listening to the show
[18:45.920 --> 18:47.360]  and hearing about the industry,
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.500]  they were gonna pack up their life
[18:48.500 --> 18:51.960]  and move to the east side of Pueblo, Colorado
[18:51.960 --> 18:54.760]  and get a job in the cannabis industry.
[18:54.760 --> 18:56.120]  That only took them about four days
[18:56.120 --> 18:58.920]  to realize they do not wanna be on the east side of Pueblo,
[18:58.920 --> 19:01.440]  and they got out of there as quickly as possible.
[19:01.440 --> 19:03.100]  They've been complaining to me in a friendly way.
[19:03.100 --> 19:05.640]  They've been venting about how not so great
[19:05.640 --> 19:07.160]  their new location is.
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.480]  And if they would have moved here or visited here,
[19:09.480 --> 19:10.800]  I'm sorry, if they would have visited here
[19:10.800 --> 19:12.600]  for just a couple of days before they moved here
[19:12.600 --> 19:15.240]  and set up shop, they probably would have realized
[19:15.240 --> 19:17.380]  they did not wanna move to where they were moving.
[19:17.380 --> 19:19.920]  So my advice to you is come visit or go visit
[19:19.920 --> 19:21.040]  wherever you think you're gonna move.
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.280]  Whether it's Broomfield, Pueblo, Denver, Longmont,
[19:25.280 --> 19:27.800]  what's down south, Trinidad, any of those places,
[19:27.800 --> 19:30.280]  they all have good and bad things about them.
[19:30.280 --> 19:32.520]  Go visit, go see if it's for you.
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.520]  Some places are for me, some places are simply not for me.
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.900]  Go see before you uproot your whole life
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.560]  and move there to grow weed.
[19:39.560 --> 19:41.200]  First of all, do you qualify?
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.480]  Can you even get the badge,
[19:42.480 --> 19:44.000]  the requirements to work in the industry?
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.680]  Then go see the place you're thinking about going.
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.120]  Everybody tells big tales and fantasies
[19:49.120 --> 19:50.880]  about what they do for work when they grow,
[19:51.720 --> 19:52.640]  but they're not gonna tell you
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.560]  that you're gonna live in the places
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.800]  they want you to think that you're living the dream.
[19:54.800 --> 19:57.200]  They're not gonna tell you that it fucking snows
[19:57.200 --> 19:58.320]  for four months out of the year
[19:58.320 --> 20:00.080]  and it's terribly fucking cold.
[20:00.080 --> 20:01.720]  They're not gonna tell you about that crazy shit.
[20:01.720 --> 20:03.720]  But come visit, that's what I'm saying.
[20:03.720 --> 20:05.760]  Let me get back on my list here.
[20:05.760 --> 20:06.600]  Do you qualify?
[20:06.600 --> 20:09.520]  Get your badge, think about visiting when you get your badge.
[20:09.520 --> 20:11.080]  Look at the places you think you're gonna live.
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.920]  Shit's expensive, get a heads up before you move.
[20:13.920 --> 20:16.720]  Then search for jobs before you move.
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.360]  When you come out here to visit,
[20:18.360 --> 20:19.880]  look at the dispensaries around you,
[20:19.880 --> 20:21.360]  if you wanna be a grower,
[20:21.360 --> 20:22.640]  when you go to the dispensary,
[20:22.640 --> 20:25.440]  ask, is there a grow attached to this facility?
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.600]  And are they hiring?
[20:26.600 --> 20:28.320]  And they'll probably have no idea.
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.300]  They'll tell you how to apply.
[20:29.300 --> 20:30.540]  They may give you an application.
[20:30.540 --> 20:32.000]  They may be able to help you out.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.320]  If you wanna work in the dispensary,
[20:33.320 --> 20:35.060]  just ask, can I work here?
[20:35.060 --> 20:37.240]  I don't recommend shopping in the dispensary
[20:37.240 --> 20:39.240]  in the same trip as you get your application
[20:39.240 --> 20:41.360]  and or drop off your application.
[20:41.360 --> 20:43.480]  I don't want a customer employee interaction
[20:43.480 --> 20:44.880]  at the same time.
[20:44.880 --> 20:47.320]  That looks to me as a hiring manager,
[20:47.320 --> 20:49.320]  it looks like you just happened to be here buying weed
[20:49.400 --> 20:50.960]  and thought maybe I'll apply.
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.760]  Do them in two separate transactions.
[20:52.760 --> 20:55.440]  Just for professionalism, that is my advice.
[20:55.440 --> 20:57.240]  When you do go to the interview,
[20:57.240 --> 21:00.280]  don't show up in your torn Led Zeppelin t-shirt
[21:00.280 --> 21:02.480]  and your sweatpants and your dirty shoes.
[21:02.480 --> 21:04.840]  Show up looking like you want a job.
[21:04.840 --> 21:07.120]  Treat this just like any other job.
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.560]  Show up for the job you want.
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.300]  If you show up looking like you don't really work hard,
[21:11.300 --> 21:13.360]  we're gonna think that you don't really work hard.
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.560]  Clean up a little bit.
[21:14.560 --> 21:15.560]  I do have dreadlocks,
[21:15.560 --> 21:17.680]  but I tie them up and make them presentable.
[21:17.680 --> 21:18.520]  Shave a little bit.
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.460]  If you've got a good beard, trim it up.
[21:20.460 --> 21:21.300]  Manicure it.
[21:21.300 --> 21:22.280]  You can have a beard and look good.
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.340]  I got dreadlocks and I take care of myself.
[21:24.340 --> 21:25.480]  You can be presentable.
[21:25.480 --> 21:26.720]  Don't show up looking lazy.
[21:26.720 --> 21:27.880]  Don't show up late.
[21:27.880 --> 21:29.760]  Don't show up high.
[21:29.760 --> 21:30.800]  Okay, show up high.
[21:30.800 --> 21:32.000]  I show up to everything high,
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.240]  but don't show up noticeably high.
[21:34.240 --> 21:35.140]  If they can tell you're high,
[21:35.140 --> 21:36.740]  you're not gonna get the job, bro.
[21:36.740 --> 21:37.580]  Don't do that.
[21:37.580 --> 21:39.360]  Be sharp, be present.
[21:39.360 --> 21:40.640]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[21:40.640 --> 21:41.880]  Took my brain a minute to get there.
[21:41.880 --> 21:42.720]  We're learning life.
[21:42.720 --> 21:44.700]  Be present at the job interview.
[21:44.700 --> 21:47.120]  If you could be lit and be present, do that.
[21:47.480 --> 21:49.080]  If you're too stoned to be fucking functional
[21:49.080 --> 21:50.720]  at the interview, don't do that.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.280]  That is a bad thing.
[21:52.280 --> 21:54.040]  So look for jobs before you get there.
[21:54.040 --> 21:57.040]  Then take the interview very, very seriously.
[21:57.040 --> 21:59.560]  Then something you're gonna have to accept here
[21:59.560 --> 22:02.580]  is that in Colorado, most of the jobs
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.600]  are going to start you off as either
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.720]  like a trimmer or a bud tender.
[22:06.720 --> 22:09.120]  I am usually, so I used to be a consultant
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.000]  and a hiring manager.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.920]  I used to do a lot of things in the commercial industry
[22:11.920 --> 22:13.240]  and the commercial grows.
[22:13.240 --> 22:14.680]  Since COVID, it got kind of weird.
[22:14.680 --> 22:15.960]  I've taken a step back from that.
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.840]  I made sort of a career change.
[22:17.840 --> 22:18.800]  It's for the better, honestly.
[22:18.800 --> 22:21.500]  It was really stressful running commercial grows.
[22:21.500 --> 22:24.040]  But one of my responsibilities in those commercial grows
[22:24.040 --> 22:26.560]  was to hire the crew, hire the staff.
[22:26.560 --> 22:27.800]  I was the hiring manager.
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.600]  One of my jobs was to make sure that everybody
[22:29.600 --> 22:31.240]  was gonna work well together,
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.680]  make sure that everybody was going to be able
[22:32.680 --> 22:34.200]  to do their job, make sure that everybody
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.760]  understood their job.
[22:35.760 --> 22:37.880]  One way that I did that was that everybody
[22:37.880 --> 22:40.960]  that started that grow, if I was hiring you
[22:40.960 --> 22:44.100]  to be the lead grower or the next consultant,
[22:44.100 --> 22:46.140]  my starting position was that you were going
[22:46.140 --> 22:47.300]  to be the trimmer.
[22:47.300 --> 22:48.860]  Everybody starts off as a trimmer.
[22:48.860 --> 22:51.200]  You have to show me that you can show up on time.
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.460]  You can follow instructions.
[22:52.460 --> 22:54.380]  You come back from lunch on time.
[22:54.380 --> 22:56.820]  You don't get so high you can't do your job.
[22:56.820 --> 22:57.900]  You can work with the group.
[22:57.900 --> 22:59.180]  You can participate.
[22:59.180 --> 23:01.220]  Just basic shit that I need employees to do
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.860]  before I give them too much access to the plants,
[23:03.860 --> 23:04.680]  they are a trimmer.
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.140]  We make them trim a little bit.
[23:06.140 --> 23:07.900]  Then we find out who you are.
[23:07.900 --> 23:10.500]  Once we see that you can work, after a week or two,
[23:10.500 --> 23:12.140]  I'll take you back to the grow and introduce you
[23:12.140 --> 23:13.820]  to small grow tasks.
[23:14.540 --> 23:16.740]  My point is, be prepared to start at the bottom.
[23:16.740 --> 23:18.980]  You may be, and I'm sorry if the trimmers are offended
[23:18.980 --> 23:20.740]  that I say you're starting at the bottom.
[23:20.740 --> 23:22.580]  That is the entry level into the grow.
[23:22.580 --> 23:24.020]  I'm not saying you're the bottom.
[23:24.020 --> 23:25.180]  Let me give the trimmers some love
[23:25.180 --> 23:26.360]  because I feel bad that I said that.
[23:26.360 --> 23:28.420]  Trimmers, I fucking love you guys.
[23:28.420 --> 23:30.660]  Without the trim crew, there would be no product.
[23:30.660 --> 23:32.420]  All the shit that we grow would sit in a room
[23:32.420 --> 23:34.700]  and get moldy and funky if the trim crew
[23:34.700 --> 23:36.300]  didn't trim it up and take it to the store.
[23:36.300 --> 23:38.820]  They are the go-between between the grow
[23:38.820 --> 23:40.380]  and the store is the trim crew.
[23:40.380 --> 23:42.660]  They are your quality assurance team.
[23:43.140 --> 23:44.740]  You're learning quality control.
[23:44.740 --> 23:45.660]  They're learning how to trim.
[23:45.660 --> 23:46.900]  They're learning what to expect,
[23:46.900 --> 23:48.520]  what goes to the dispensary.
[23:48.520 --> 23:51.660]  The trim crew is a very important aspect of the operation.
[23:51.660 --> 23:54.740]  I feel bad that I kinda made it feel like you were not
[23:54.740 --> 23:56.940]  as important as you are because you are very important,
[23:56.940 --> 24:00.620]  but you are the entry area for my training.
[24:00.620 --> 24:01.660]  Big up to the trim crew.
[24:01.660 --> 24:02.740]  I'm kissing your ass now.
[24:02.740 --> 24:03.780]  Feel bad the way I said that.
[24:03.780 --> 24:05.660]  Trim crew, you gotta start on the trim crew.
[24:05.660 --> 24:06.720]  We know you show up.
[24:06.720 --> 24:07.860]  Once we know you're gonna show up,
[24:07.860 --> 24:09.020]  then we'll move you around the grow
[24:09.020 --> 24:10.820]  to the place that you wanted to be,
[24:10.820 --> 24:12.100]  but you're gonna have to move up.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.980]  I'm not gonna let you show up in water plants
[24:13.980 --> 24:15.060]  on the first day.
[24:15.060 --> 24:16.140]  I don't know who you are.
[24:16.140 --> 24:17.260]  I don't know if you're crazy.
[24:17.260 --> 24:18.740]  I don't know if you can follow instructions.
[24:18.740 --> 24:20.260]  I don't know if you're on drugs, man.
[24:20.260 --> 24:21.920]  We gotta learn you and figure you out.
[24:21.920 --> 24:25.480]  So be prepared to start at the bottom and work your way up.
[24:25.480 --> 24:27.620]  Your performance will tell me how far
[24:27.620 --> 24:30.060]  and where you go in my facility.
[24:30.060 --> 24:33.960]  I want everybody to be lead growers because one day,
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.660]  and it does happen, I might get sick
[24:35.660 --> 24:37.300]  or who knows what could happen to me,
[24:37.300 --> 24:38.940]  and I want there to be people in line
[24:38.940 --> 24:41.380]  to take over my position.
[24:41.380 --> 24:43.900]  I don't want everybody to be a grow tech forever.
[24:43.900 --> 24:46.260]  I want everybody to be the lead grower,
[24:46.260 --> 24:47.820]  the consultant, the head grower,
[24:47.820 --> 24:49.280]  the head motherfucker in charge.
[24:49.280 --> 24:51.260]  That is the goal so that everybody
[24:51.260 --> 24:52.520]  just keeps to get moving up.
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.700]  As I leave a facility, that lead grower
[24:54.700 --> 24:57.580]  should become the new whatever director of cultivation,
[24:57.580 --> 24:59.620]  and then everybody should just take steps up.
[24:59.620 --> 25:02.380]  I think we should all be passing down that knowledge.
[25:02.380 --> 25:05.340]  So don't be afraid to start at an entry-level position
[25:05.340 --> 25:07.620]  as a trimmer, as a training bud tender,
[25:07.620 --> 25:10.960]  as just somebody in the back packaging shit up all day.
[25:10.960 --> 25:13.360]  We've got to find out, basically we're testing you.
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.400]  Can you show up five days in a row on time?
[25:15.400 --> 25:18.360]  Can you come back from lunch five days in a row on time?
[25:18.360 --> 25:19.440]  Can you work with the group?
[25:19.440 --> 25:20.660]  Can you follow instructions?
[25:20.660 --> 25:22.280]  Did you steal anything?
[25:22.280 --> 25:23.800]  Basic shit, that's all we're trying to do.
[25:23.800 --> 25:25.820]  So be ready to start at the bottom.
[25:25.820 --> 25:28.760]  Also expect shit pay, shit treatment,
[25:28.760 --> 25:30.640]  shit work, and shit hours.
[25:30.640 --> 25:32.080]  The new people always get the shit,
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.360]  but that's how it is in almost any industry.
[25:34.360 --> 25:37.040]  We exaggerate that in the cannabis industry.
[25:37.040 --> 25:39.240]  If you do get hired in the commercial facility,
[25:39.240 --> 25:41.320]  it will not be glamorous work.
[25:41.320 --> 25:42.480]  You're going to get sticky.
[25:42.480 --> 25:43.400]  You're gonna get dirty.
[25:43.400 --> 25:45.040]  You're gonna get nutrients on you.
[25:45.040 --> 25:45.880]  You're gonna get muddy.
[25:45.880 --> 25:47.400]  You may have to do some outside work.
[25:47.400 --> 25:49.160]  You're gonna have to take out the trash.
[25:49.160 --> 25:51.160]  You also may have to clean the bathrooms.
[25:51.160 --> 25:52.360]  Also, I'm gonna make a note.
[25:52.360 --> 25:53.960]  I clean the bathrooms also.
[25:53.960 --> 25:55.300]  There's just a chart on the wall.
[25:55.300 --> 25:56.560]  Every employee gets a list,
[25:56.560 --> 25:58.200]  and then we just go down the list.
[25:58.200 --> 25:59.380]  Start at the top today.
[25:59.380 --> 26:00.320]  I clean it tomorrow.
[26:00.320 --> 26:01.280]  You clean it the next day.
[26:01.280 --> 26:02.320]  That guy cleans it.
[26:02.320 --> 26:04.060]  We just go down the fucking rotation.
[26:04.060 --> 26:05.720]  Hopefully there's enough people on the list.
[26:05.720 --> 26:07.000]  You don't have to do it very long.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.980]  Just clean in the bathroom once every couple of weeks.
[26:09.720 --> 26:10.560]  It's not that bad.
[26:10.560 --> 26:11.380]  You guys clean the shit up.
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.380]  You took a shit in there too.
[26:12.380 --> 26:13.220]  Clean it up.
[26:13.220 --> 26:14.040]  It's not that bad.
[26:14.040 --> 26:14.880]  But we all have to clean the bathrooms.
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.020]  You gotta do all that kind of stuff,
[26:16.020 --> 26:19.100]  but you're gonna start off at kind of low pay
[26:19.100 --> 26:21.960]  because unless you get a job like a lead grower
[26:21.960 --> 26:24.460]  or a consultant or a lead bud tender
[26:24.460 --> 26:26.740]  or a manager or something higher up,
[26:26.740 --> 26:30.000]  it is going to be low pay and crappy hours.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.560]  And the terrible part about it is a lot of the employers
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.700]  don't have to pay higher because there are plenty of people
[26:36.700 --> 26:38.900]  that keep coming from other states to work here
[26:39.740 --> 26:41.060]  to do the jobs, unfortunately.
[26:41.060 --> 26:43.060]  So they're not gonna raise the wages.
[26:43.060 --> 26:45.580]  There's not enough profit to raise the wages.
[26:45.580 --> 26:47.500]  Unfortunately, that's just how it is
[26:47.500 --> 26:49.560]  in the cannabis industry.
[26:49.560 --> 26:51.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I noticed that camera
[26:51.160 --> 26:52.400]  doing something weird.
[26:52.400 --> 26:54.660]  I wanna wrap up this show before I lose it.
[26:54.660 --> 26:57.020]  I wanna make sure we get all of this recording saved.
[26:57.020 --> 26:59.260]  I really do hope I answered this question thoroughly
[26:59.260 --> 27:02.600]  because I just bailed, pulled a ripcord and panic mode.
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[27:04.220 --> 27:06.380]  pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers, growers,
[27:06.380 --> 27:08.020]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[27:08.020 --> 27:09.900]  all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[27:09.900 --> 27:12.020]  I do wanna thank you once again for listening
[27:12.020 --> 27:15.540]  to this episode that I do hope makes it to the internet.
[27:15.540 --> 27:17.140]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments
[27:17.140 --> 27:18.900]  or concerns, please do send them to me
[27:18.900 --> 27:20.900]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:20.900 --> 27:23.380]  I look forward to hearing from you.

[27:27.140 --> 27:31.340]  Everything else is on the website at ireygenetics.com.
[27:31.340 --> 27:33.560]  I apologize for wrapping it up so abruptly.
[27:33.560 --> 27:34.740]  Don't wanna lose anything.
[27:34.740 --> 27:37.220]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[27:37.220 --> 27:38.260]  I'll fix the camera.
[27:38.260 --> 27:39.420]  We'll see what's going on.
[27:39.420 --> 27:41.740]  Let's give a big shout out to my buddy, Stoner Dave.
[27:41.740 --> 27:43.820]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[27:43.820 --> 27:45.380]  and give your mom a hug for me.
