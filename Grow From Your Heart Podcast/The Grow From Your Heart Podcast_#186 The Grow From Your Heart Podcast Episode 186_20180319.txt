[00:01.470 --> 00:03.630]  Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[00:03.630 --> 00:05.290]  It's time for another throwback episode.
[00:05.290 --> 00:07.870]  This time I'm going to put out episodes seven, eight, and nine.
[00:07.870 --> 00:11.550]  Let me do a couple of disclaimers before I get into the episodes.
[00:11.550 --> 00:13.910]  All of the social media has changed.
[00:13.910 --> 00:19.270]  Now it is at GFYH podcast on Twitter and the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook,
[00:19.270 --> 00:22.790]  and the email is at, no, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[00:22.790 --> 00:23.790]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:23.790 --> 00:28.770]  Also, a lot of my ideas and opinions may have changed in 185 episodes, so if I said some
[00:28.770 --> 00:30.710]  shit that was stupid, please forgive me.
[00:30.930 --> 00:35.170]  All right, I don't want to make this file too long, so here is episode seven, eight,
[00:35.170 --> 00:37.330]  and nine of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:00.730 --> 01:03.390]  From my neighbors to the north Now Cali runs the valley
[01:03.390 --> 01:04.930]  Henceforth, henceforth
[01:04.930 --> 01:08.010]  Linus with the bumpin' track Let me get another pack
[01:08.010 --> 01:10.950]  Blowin' on the butter so you know the motherfucker's back
[01:10.950 --> 01:13.570]  Fuck who was gifted and we lifted like a hovercraft
[01:13.570 --> 01:16.630]  Lumberjacks comin' for your trees, then we run it back
[01:16.630 --> 01:19.390]  All my friends creatin' gold from a bunch of scraps
[01:19.390 --> 01:22.370]  We set the trends, break the mold, then we run it back
[01:22.370 --> 01:24.630]  People thankin' me for showin' them the way to go
[01:24.630 --> 01:27.790]  Like, way to go, B.H.O. made it on the radio
[01:27.790 --> 01:31.990]  Give me a dabber and a skillet and nettle Or a mic, cause I'm a rapper who can kill
[01:31.990 --> 01:33.190]  it as well
[01:33.190 --> 01:37.710]  Entrepreneur man, buildin' a wealth Iller than Duff, so cool I only chill with
[01:37.710 --> 01:38.710]  myself
[01:38.710 --> 01:43.430]  Yeah, so if you're wallowin' I would bet It's probably cause you wanna be followin'
[01:43.430 --> 01:44.430]  my footsteps
[01:44.430 --> 01:47.390]  If you're a fan, then it's likely you're a pioneer
[01:47.390 --> 01:49.910]  You can look back on this day and say I was here
[01:49.910 --> 01:52.390]  First place in the race Hand raised with the torch
[01:52.390 --> 01:55.350]  Get the paper, you don't need no coach
[01:55.350 --> 01:56.830]  What's up, podcast world?
[01:56.830 --> 01:58.830]  Welcome to the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[01:58.830 --> 02:00.830]  This is episode number 7.
[02:00.830 --> 02:02.830]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, hanging out with my buddy Kevin.
[02:02.830 --> 02:03.830]  What's up, bro?
[02:03.830 --> 02:04.830]  What up?
[02:04.830 --> 02:06.830]  We're coming to you for the second time today.
[02:06.830 --> 02:07.830]  We had a little computer issue.
[02:07.830 --> 02:09.830]  I think I got it figured out.
[02:09.830 --> 02:10.830]  It helps if you press record.
[02:10.830 --> 02:13.830]  No, that's not really what happened, but I think we got the computer going, so we're
[02:13.830 --> 02:17.830]  here strong, ready to dab out, bring you our Cannabis Cup Review Show.
[02:17.830 --> 02:20.830]  We had a fuckin' amazing 420 this weekend.
[02:20.830 --> 02:22.830]  Hope you guys had as good of a 420 as we did.
[02:23.310 --> 02:26.310]  If your 420 was half as cool as mine, you had a great time.
[02:26.310 --> 02:27.310]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:27.310 --> 02:28.310]  For sure.
[02:28.310 --> 02:31.310]  I'm gonna turn down the music a little bit, and we're gonna get down to business here.
[02:31.310 --> 02:35.310]  I got a couple of ads to read before we can talk about the Cannabis Cup.
[02:37.310 --> 02:41.310]  Before we go any further, this episode is brought to you by Nature's Green Remedies.com.

[03:31.790 --> 03:33.790]  It was a pleasure to meet and see you this weekend.
[03:33.790 --> 03:35.790]  Well, I met you before, but it was a pleasure to see you again, bro.
[03:35.790 --> 03:36.790]  Meet up with you.
[03:37.790 --> 03:40.790]  So, how was your 420 weekend, Kev?
[03:40.790 --> 03:41.790]  It was awesome.
[03:41.790 --> 03:42.790]  You were there.
[03:42.790 --> 03:43.790]  I was there, bro.
[03:43.790 --> 03:44.790]  I wanted you to have some input, bro.
[03:44.790 --> 03:45.790]  Come on.
[03:45.790 --> 03:46.790]  It was a great time.
[03:46.790 --> 03:50.790]  I met some of my heroes in the community, if you will.
[03:50.790 --> 03:53.790]  We partied it up.
[03:53.790 --> 03:54.790]  We did party it up, dude.
[03:54.790 --> 03:56.790]  A lot of people liked our dabs.
[03:56.790 --> 03:57.790]  Yeah, that was cool.
[03:57.790 --> 03:59.790]  It was kind of very...
[04:01.790 --> 04:02.790]  Honoring?
[04:02.790 --> 04:04.790]  Yeah, I guess that would be a perfect word for sure.
[04:04.790 --> 04:06.790]  I don't know if honoring is actually a...
[04:06.790 --> 04:07.790]  Yeah, I don't know if that's a word.
[04:07.790 --> 04:08.790]  See, I was trying to think of a real word.
[04:08.790 --> 04:10.790]  I don't think it is, but sure.
[04:10.790 --> 04:14.790]  Most people are here for dabs, not English class, which is cool because we get a little
[04:14.790 --> 04:15.790]  ridiculous on that.
[04:16.790 --> 04:19.790]  Yeah, we went to the Cannabis Cup, the US Cannabis Cup.
[04:19.790 --> 04:24.790]  I think it's the High Times US Cannabis Cup in Denver, where anybody 21 and over was able
[04:24.790 --> 04:27.790]  to hang out, freely smoke cannabis with us.
[04:27.790 --> 04:29.790]  Dabs were available.
[04:29.790 --> 04:31.790]  Cannabis was available.
[04:31.790 --> 04:33.790]  We were having a grand old time.
[04:35.790 --> 04:37.790]  So, the first day, I guess we'll get kind of into that.
[04:37.790 --> 04:41.790]  The first day we got there, we stood in line for two hours, which sounds like it would
[04:41.790 --> 04:43.790]  suck, but to tell you the truth, man, that was kind of...
[04:43.790 --> 04:44.790]  It started the party just right.
[04:44.790 --> 04:45.790]  We got to hang out.
[04:45.790 --> 04:48.790]  Yeah, hang out in line with a bunch of cool people.
[04:48.790 --> 04:49.790]  Just hang out.
[04:49.790 --> 04:51.790]  We were dabbing in the parking lot.
[04:51.790 --> 04:55.790]  It sort of kind of reminded me a lot of my old school fish tour, widespread panic tour
[04:55.790 --> 04:56.790]  days.
[04:56.790 --> 05:00.790]  That's where we used to just hang out in the lot all day and make friends and get down,
[05:00.790 --> 05:02.790]  kind of do with what you had there.
[05:02.790 --> 05:03.790]  Yeah, that was a good time.
[05:03.790 --> 05:06.790]  Met some cool people, did some dabs, smoked some weed.
[05:06.790 --> 05:10.790]  We met people from seven or eight different states just while we were hanging in line
[05:10.790 --> 05:11.790]  for two hours.
[05:12.790 --> 05:14.790]  Shout out to my buddy Sammy for a little bit of help there.
[05:14.790 --> 05:16.790]  We needed some help for a minute and Sam helped us.
[05:16.790 --> 05:17.790]  That was really cool of you, bro.
[05:17.790 --> 05:18.790]  Really appreciate that.
[05:20.790 --> 05:21.790]  Yeah, I was with him all day.
[05:21.790 --> 05:22.790]  All day.
[05:22.790 --> 05:23.790]  That was a cool guy.
[05:23.790 --> 05:24.790]  Shout out, Sammy.
[05:24.790 --> 05:25.790]  Shout out to the Weed Nerd crew.
[05:25.790 --> 05:26.790]  There was no drama at the Cannabis Cup.
[05:26.790 --> 05:29.790]  I didn't see any ridiculous, crazy drama.
[05:29.790 --> 05:34.790]  I saw one girl look like she might be passing out kind of a moment and they had to kind
[05:34.790 --> 05:38.790]  of put her in a chair, but that was the scariest shit I saw all weekend for the most part.
[05:38.790 --> 05:41.790]  People seem to behave themselves and take good care of themselves.
[05:43.790 --> 05:44.790]  Yeah.
[05:44.790 --> 05:45.790]  Yeah, you agree.
[05:45.790 --> 05:46.790]  Kev agrees.
[05:46.790 --> 05:47.790]  No rebuttal or anything to that.
[05:47.790 --> 05:48.790]  Nice, that's great.
[05:48.790 --> 05:50.790]  That was exactly correct.
[05:50.790 --> 05:51.790]  Nice.
[05:51.790 --> 05:54.790]  I think they really, really improved the Cannabis Cup this year.
[05:54.790 --> 05:55.790]  Yeah, definitely.
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.790]  Last year it was crowded.
[05:56.790 --> 06:00.790]  I heard a lot of people saying they were having panic attacks because it was just too damn
[06:00.790 --> 06:01.790]  crowded.
[06:01.790 --> 06:04.790]  This year you were able to move around, you were able to get to the booths.
[06:04.790 --> 06:05.790]  They gave out a pretty nice map.
[06:06.790 --> 06:10.790]  They told you where, who was, who was on first, if you will.
[06:10.790 --> 06:12.790]  We're not even going to go down that route at all.
[06:12.790 --> 06:14.790]  So, a big shout out to those guys.
[06:14.790 --> 06:16.790]  They did a really cool improvement.
[06:16.790 --> 06:18.790]  Everything was nice and smooth.
[06:18.790 --> 06:20.790]  It was easy to get through.
[06:20.790 --> 06:27.790]  There wasn't a vegetarian food option that I could find, but I guess that's my own dumbass.
[06:27.790 --> 06:29.790]  I don't need to complain about that.
[06:29.790 --> 06:31.790]  If I could find some vegetarian food there, it would have been an oasis.
[06:32.790 --> 06:35.790]  I had ice cream for lunch, which kind of made me feel like shit by the end of the day.
[06:35.790 --> 06:38.790]  That's my only gripe, I guess, with the whole thing.
[06:38.790 --> 06:43.790]  It was worth it because I got to see all of my friends, old and new.
[06:43.790 --> 06:44.790]  Yeah, for sure.
[06:44.790 --> 06:47.790]  If I wanted to list all the people that I saw there and say hi to everybody, this show
[06:47.790 --> 06:51.790]  would be four hours long because Kevin and I, we spent more time just stopping and saying,
[06:51.790 --> 06:52.790]  hey, what's up man?
[06:52.790 --> 06:53.790]  Good to see you.
[06:53.790 --> 06:54.790]  Good to meet you.
[06:54.790 --> 06:55.790]  It was a great time.
[06:55.790 --> 06:57.790]  We got through the first day and it was hot.
[06:57.790 --> 06:58.790]  We roamed around.
[06:59.790 --> 07:03.790]  We were only there for a couple of minutes before we started bumping into people, but
[07:03.790 --> 07:04.790]  then it rained.
[07:04.790 --> 07:07.790]  So everybody kind of sought shelter.
[07:07.790 --> 07:11.790]  We ran into this little building and that kind of cleared out a lot of the large chaotic
[07:11.790 --> 07:12.790]  crowd for the first day.
[07:12.790 --> 07:14.790]  So Kevin and I felt like we had a lot of the place to ourselves.
[07:14.790 --> 07:18.790]  It felt like it was mostly the crew, you know, like people that had a booth.
[07:18.790 --> 07:23.790]  So we ended up walking through and this guy named Swerve Swerven, he's the owner of the
[07:23.790 --> 07:25.790]  Cali Connection, he kind of calls us over to his booth.
[07:26.790 --> 07:27.790]  And we thought he wanted to chat.
[07:27.790 --> 07:28.790]  He actually wanted to hang out with us.
[07:28.790 --> 07:30.790]  He invited us to the back of his booth.
[07:30.790 --> 07:34.790]  We did a few dabs, ended up hanging out with Addison DeMora.
[07:34.790 --> 07:36.790]  John Hunt was there, Grammy Gatsby.
[07:36.790 --> 07:39.790]  And then this dude named Darby Holm showed up with a case of glass.
[07:39.790 --> 07:42.790]  And Kevin and I, I had to hide my stoner boner.
[07:42.790 --> 07:44.790]  I was getting a little out of control there.
[07:44.790 --> 07:47.790]  That glass was some of the most beautiful glass I've ever seen in person.
[07:47.790 --> 07:49.790]  It was nice.
[07:49.790 --> 07:50.790]  Yeah.
[07:50.790 --> 07:52.790]  So we got to dab out with Darby Holm.
[07:52.790 --> 07:56.790]  We dabbed with the Steep Hill crew and the Cali Connection crew and Adam Mill,
[07:56.790 --> 07:58.790]  which was kind of an honor.
[07:58.790 --> 08:01.790]  If you guys don't know who Adam Mill is, he kind of inspired part of this podcast.
[08:01.790 --> 08:03.790]  He had a podcast a long time ago.
[08:03.790 --> 08:05.790]  It wasn't a long time ago in stoner time.
[08:05.790 --> 08:06.790]  It was a long time ago.
[08:06.790 --> 08:08.790]  But he had a podcast and it kind of got shut down.
[08:08.790 --> 08:09.790]  He started his own thing.
[08:09.790 --> 08:11.790]  And he just recently got re-added to iTunes.
[08:11.790 --> 08:13.790]  So check out Getting High with Adam Mill.
[08:13.790 --> 08:14.790]  That's my buddy.
[08:14.790 --> 08:16.790]  I usually don't promote other podcasts.
[08:16.790 --> 08:17.790]  It's kind of weird.
[08:17.790 --> 08:18.790]  But that's my bro.
[08:18.790 --> 08:19.790]  I like him.
[08:19.790 --> 08:20.790]  Listen to his show.
[08:20.790 --> 08:21.790]  He inspired me to do part of it.
[08:21.790 --> 08:24.790]  He inspired us to do what we're doing here.
[08:24.790 --> 08:26.790]  So, yeah, shout out to everybody that I saw this weekend.
[08:26.790 --> 08:27.790]  That's where I was headed.
[08:27.790 --> 08:31.790]  Man, I can't start to list off the people because I feel so bad because I'll leave everybody out.
[08:31.790 --> 08:34.790]  We mentioned the Cali Connection crew, all the seed companies.
[08:34.790 --> 08:38.790]  I got to hang out with Gage Green, Alpha Chronic, La Plata.
[08:38.790 --> 08:39.790]  I'm going to miss a bunch of people.
[08:39.790 --> 08:42.790]  Sin City was there.
[08:42.790 --> 08:43.790]  The Oil Slick booth.
[08:43.790 --> 08:44.790]  The Oil Slick boys.
[08:44.790 --> 08:46.790]  It's always great to see the Oil Slick crew.
[08:46.790 --> 08:48.790]  Those guys are some of the funnest kids in the business.
[08:49.790 --> 08:53.790]  Just a shout out to Nika.
[08:53.790 --> 08:55.790]  I've hung out with him a little bit.
[08:55.790 --> 08:56.790]  I was selecting Nika Tea.
[08:56.790 --> 09:02.790]  I gave Nika Tea a pack of seeds, and in return he gave me some cannabis capsules.
[09:02.790 --> 09:03.790]  Those are much appreciated.
[09:03.790 --> 09:06.790]  There's a family member in need.
[09:06.790 --> 09:09.790]  Thank you, Jeff, for kicking those down.
[09:09.790 --> 09:10.790]  Absolutely, bro.
[09:10.790 --> 09:11.790]  Absolutely.
[09:11.790 --> 09:12.790]  To Pops.
[09:12.790 --> 09:14.790]  Yeah, Pops needs some help.
[09:14.790 --> 09:17.790]  We're going to do everything we can to get Pops back on his feet and super healthy again.
[09:17.790 --> 09:18.790]  Yeah, for sure.
[09:18.790 --> 09:19.790]  That's what we do here.
[09:19.790 --> 09:20.790]  All right.
[09:20.790 --> 09:22.790]  We saw a bunch of cool people.
[09:22.790 --> 09:23.790]  We want to say what's up to all those people.
[09:23.790 --> 09:27.790]  If we saw you and shook your hand, dude, we're saying what's up to you right now because we don't want to leave anybody out.
[09:27.790 --> 09:31.790]  I was going to wait a little longer to get into this part, but you know who was there that we never saw?
[09:31.790 --> 09:33.790]  Ginny Kush, bro.
[09:33.790 --> 09:34.790]  Oh, yeah.
[09:34.790 --> 09:35.790]  That girl was all over the place.
[09:35.790 --> 09:39.790]  She was the most popular girl at the party, and she wasn't even there, bro.
[09:39.790 --> 09:41.790]  She was not even there.
[09:41.790 --> 09:42.790]  Much love to Ginny Kush.
[09:42.790 --> 09:44.790]  We're going to talk a little more about that lovely lady later.
[09:45.790 --> 09:47.790]  So, bro, what was your favorite booth at the Cannabis Cup?
[09:47.790 --> 09:55.790]  I'm biased as shit, but the Cali Connection booth was my favorite booth.
[09:55.790 --> 09:57.790]  Yeah, we did spend a little bit of time there.
[09:57.790 --> 09:58.790]  We had a lot of fun.
[09:58.790 --> 09:59.790]  I'm going to throw on some music in the background.
[09:59.790 --> 10:01.790]  Oh, shit.
[10:01.790 --> 10:02.790]  I'm going to turn it down, and then I'll throw on some music.
[10:02.790 --> 10:05.790]  I can't think of the name of the booth, and I forgot those guys' names already.
[10:05.790 --> 10:07.790]  The place where I bought both my rigs.
[10:07.790 --> 10:09.790]  Yeah, Kev got some really sick glass.
[10:09.790 --> 10:12.790]  That shit was awesome, dude.
[10:12.790 --> 10:13.790]  I don't know.
[10:13.790 --> 10:15.790]  Those guys were so cool.
[10:15.790 --> 10:22.790]  They had my favorite glass at the place other than Darlie Holmes' little personal case.
[10:22.790 --> 10:24.790]  There was some amazing glass there this weekend.
[10:24.790 --> 10:25.790]  Yeah, there was.
[10:25.790 --> 10:27.790]  There was some tight stuff.
[10:27.790 --> 10:30.790]  So, do you have a moment that you'll never forget from this Cannabis Cup?
[10:35.980 --> 10:42.980]  The moment that John Hunt dabbed at, I think it was that lemon mix,
[10:42.980 --> 10:44.980]  and he had a big ol' huge grin and was like,
[10:44.980 --> 10:47.980]  Yeah! That's what's up!
[10:47.980 --> 10:48.980]  And he like...
[10:48.980 --> 10:51.980]  So, the Grimey Gatsby likes the hash that Kev makes.
[10:51.980 --> 10:52.980]  That was tight.
[10:52.980 --> 10:55.980]  And that is an honor, because those guys get to smoke a lot of hash.
[10:55.980 --> 10:56.980]  Yeah.
[10:56.980 --> 11:01.980]  And then Addison hit it right afterward and did a very similar reaction.
[11:01.980 --> 11:04.980]  He's the one who actually pointed me out to Darby's Glass.
[11:04.980 --> 11:06.980]  He was like, show me this rig.
[11:06.980 --> 11:07.980]  He's like, come here.
[11:08.980 --> 11:12.980]  Yeah, so that was a huge honor just to be invited to hang out in the back of the Cali Connection booth.
[11:12.980 --> 11:14.980]  I don't know how we managed that.
[11:14.980 --> 11:17.980]  And then Saturday was chaos.
[11:17.980 --> 11:23.980]  It was controlled chaos, but Saturday about 3.50, I realized 4.20 is creeping up.
[11:23.980 --> 11:26.980]  We should find a nice spot to hang out and take some dabs.
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.980]  And it was a hectic place.
[11:27.980 --> 11:30.980]  It's like a state fair based around weed, and I don't mean to downplay it,
[11:30.980 --> 11:33.980]  but you know, you got your booths, you got all your vendors lined up,
[11:33.980 --> 11:35.980]  and there's a grid of people just rushing left and right.
[11:35.980 --> 11:37.980]  Everyone's trying to get from place to place.
[11:37.980 --> 11:39.980]  We wanted to find a nice cool spot to take some dabs for 4.20,
[11:39.980 --> 11:44.980]  and something in my mind said that Cali Connection booth had two really cool couches.
[11:44.980 --> 11:49.980]  So we wandered towards there, and we could see from one angle that those couches were completely empty.
[11:49.980 --> 11:50.980]  And there happened to be—
[11:50.980 --> 11:51.980]  That was on Sunday, right?
[11:51.980 --> 11:53.980]  Oh, that was Sunday. Sorry. Sorry.
[11:53.980 --> 11:54.980]  Yeah, that was actually 4.20.
[11:54.980 --> 11:55.980]  Yeah.
[11:55.980 --> 11:57.980]  So we wanted a nice spot for 4.20.
[11:57.980 --> 11:58.980]  Dude, you're playing with that piece of shatter.
[11:58.980 --> 11:59.980]  Why don't you—
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.980]  I'm gonna.
[12:00.980 --> 12:01.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[12:01.980 --> 12:05.980]  No, I mean like pick it up and make like a nice couple of dabs for us with that shit.
[12:05.980 --> 12:06.980]  Yeah, I'm gonna.
[12:06.980 --> 12:07.980]  There you go.
[12:07.980 --> 12:08.980]  I'm gonna do.
[12:08.980 --> 12:13.980]  I left that shatter on the table for the weekend, and I think it cured itself up a little bit better.
[12:13.980 --> 12:14.980]  That's cool.
[12:14.980 --> 12:18.980]  So Sunday, by the way, it was Sunday. I'm high and saying the wrong day.
[12:18.980 --> 12:19.980]  Sunday we're cruising.
[12:19.980 --> 12:22.980]  We end up over at the Cali Connection booth, and there's this big dude blocking the way,
[12:22.980 --> 12:26.980]  and he was a big biker guy, and he must have recognized us from being there earlier
[12:26.980 --> 12:28.980]  because he goes, you guys need to get back in there?
[12:28.980 --> 12:31.980]  And I go, yeah, man, I need to get right in that booth, and he moved out of my way
[12:31.980 --> 12:35.980]  and kind of let us—he pushed the crowd out and let me and Kev right into the back of the Cali Connection booth.
[12:35.980 --> 12:38.980]  And one of the guys who works at Cali Connection—I don't know your name, bro.
[12:38.980 --> 12:40.980]  Oh, my God, I wish I knew who that dude was.
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.980]  He's kind of a tall dude. He's got long hair. He's got kind of dark skin.
[12:43.980 --> 12:47.980]  He was wearing boots and jeans and a hat, and that guy is a cool-ass dude.
[12:47.980 --> 12:48.980]  Shout out to that guy.
[12:48.980 --> 12:51.980]  Yeah, if you're listening to this right now, dude whose name is not known,
[12:51.980 --> 12:54.980]  hit us up and let us know your name.
[12:54.980 --> 12:59.980]  Yeah, we'll see you next time, definitely, because that guy saw us come in,
[12:59.980 --> 13:02.980]  and he was like, oh, man, get back in here because this crowd is getting thick.
[13:02.980 --> 13:07.980]  And he let us grab two spots on the couch, and we dabbed out the Cali Connection crew for $420.
[13:07.980 --> 13:11.980]  Adam Mill was working his ass off getting shirts and merchandise to the crowd, hyping up the crowd.
[13:11.980 --> 13:12.980]  They were hustling, dude.
[13:12.980 --> 13:13.980]  They were hustling.
[13:13.980 --> 13:14.980]  And doing dabs with us.
[13:14.980 --> 13:17.980]  And that's why I was trying to keep them dabbed out.
[13:17.980 --> 13:20.980]  I owe Swerve and Adam Mill. Those guys have done me a couple favors.
[13:20.980 --> 13:23.980]  They're just crew, so I was like, let's go dab them out, and they gave us a spot to chill.
[13:23.980 --> 13:24.980]  So that was a true honor.
[13:24.980 --> 13:26.980]  A lot of people hate on those guys.
[13:26.980 --> 13:29.980]  I know we keep mentioning that, but it was awesome.
[13:29.980 --> 13:33.980]  It's like if you play his fork, imagine the biggest star.
[13:33.980 --> 13:39.980]  If you play basketball, imagine Michael Jordan inviting you into his house and play basketball.
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.980]  And then him love your shot.
[13:41.980 --> 13:42.980]  That's kind of what it was like, yeah.
[13:42.980 --> 13:44.980]  That's fucking cool.
[13:44.980 --> 13:46.980]  I would agree with that, yeah.
[13:46.980 --> 13:49.980]  This was like stoner boner moment the whole entire weekend.
[13:50.980 --> 13:58.980]  You know you've arrived when you walk into the Cannabis Cup and all your fellow breeders are ignoring customers to come run over to you and talk to you for a moment.
[13:58.980 --> 13:59.980]  That's kind of neat.
[13:59.980 --> 14:01.980]  It is quite neat.
[14:01.980 --> 14:03.980]  It's a neat thing to see.
[14:03.980 --> 14:08.980]  I really enjoyed getting all the ceramic products that were out and about.
[14:08.980 --> 14:11.980]  I have been thoroughly impressed with those ceramic products.
[14:11.980 --> 14:16.980]  I wasn't sure if I would be, but I have been very impressed.
[14:17.980 --> 14:21.980]  If you get your hands on some ceramics or know somebody who has them, give it a shot.
[14:21.980 --> 14:22.980]  Give it a try.
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.980]  See what it's like.
[14:25.980 --> 14:27.980]  I enjoy it.
[14:27.980 --> 14:31.980]  Next week or the next episode, whenever it is, will probably be the start of next week.
[14:31.980 --> 14:36.980]  We're going to actually have you bring over your ceramic and we'll do a little review on the show and we'll see how you think a week later.
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.980]  Cool.
[14:37.980 --> 14:39.980]  I'm curious about it.
[14:39.980 --> 14:40.980]  It did taste good.
[14:40.980 --> 14:44.980]  It seemed kind of clean when we took dabs off it, but I'm a little partial to the titanium.
[14:44.980 --> 14:46.980]  I'm afraid I'm going to break that ceramic.
[14:46.980 --> 14:47.980]  That's my biggest fear.
[14:47.980 --> 14:49.980]  That's why I don't want to take it around.
[14:49.980 --> 14:50.980]  It's like my home.
[14:50.980 --> 14:51.980]  There you go.
[14:51.980 --> 14:52.980]  Your personal...
[14:52.980 --> 14:53.980]  You know what I mean?
[14:53.980 --> 14:54.980]  All right.
[14:54.980 --> 14:57.980]  On my pendant rig and the shit I take around.
[14:57.980 --> 15:00.980]  I'm highly educated on all that shit.
[15:00.980 --> 15:01.980]  There you go.
[15:01.980 --> 15:02.980]  Yeah.
[15:02.980 --> 15:04.980]  I'm looking for some more music here.
[15:04.980 --> 15:05.980]  I know what I want to find.
[15:05.980 --> 15:08.980]  It's easier to play it off of this way than doing it the other way.
[15:08.980 --> 15:10.980]  I'm going to play a little bit of TASK this episode.
[15:10.980 --> 15:11.980]  It's been fun seeing him.
[15:11.980 --> 15:14.980]  Got a little great vibe for the background.
[15:14.980 --> 15:17.980]  I hate it that YouTube plays commercials now.
[15:17.980 --> 15:18.980]  It's obnoxious.
[15:18.980 --> 15:24.980]  My favorite part of the Cannabis Cup collectively I think would be just the unity that I felt.
[15:24.980 --> 15:26.980]  The welcomeness and the unity.
[15:26.980 --> 15:29.980]  It felt like we're actually getting somewhere.
[15:29.980 --> 15:31.980]  We've been going to all these events.
[15:31.980 --> 15:32.980]  We've been working our asses off.
[15:32.980 --> 15:35.980]  People don't see what the hash companies do and what the seed breeders do as much,
[15:35.980 --> 15:38.980]  but we're finally getting some respect from our peers.
[15:38.980 --> 15:39.980]  It's nice.
[15:39.980 --> 15:40.980]  Thank you, guys.
[15:40.980 --> 15:42.980]  We're just a couple of punk kids from Pueblo.
[15:42.980 --> 15:43.980]  It's good to be accepted.
[15:43.980 --> 15:46.980]  Yeah, it felt like it was all just one.
[15:46.980 --> 15:48.980]  It was all one around there.
[15:48.980 --> 15:51.980]  No matter who you were or where you were from or whatever.
[15:51.980 --> 15:55.980]  I always kept thinking everyone was from Colorado.
[15:55.980 --> 15:57.980]  I kept forgetting there was tons of people there from other places.
[15:57.980 --> 15:59.980]  There was somebody there from every state.
[15:59.980 --> 16:00.980]  I would say every state.
[16:00.980 --> 16:04.980]  I kept forgetting, though, just because of the attitude and the vibe everybody had.
[16:04.980 --> 16:05.980]  It was all the same.
[16:05.980 --> 16:08.980]  It was just like everyone was from the same place.
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.980]  Big love to Miss Nadia Dabbs, if you're listening, sweetie.
[16:10.980 --> 16:11.980]  Thanks for the hug.
[16:11.980 --> 16:12.980]  Thanks for sharing some dabs with us.
[16:12.980 --> 16:13.980]  I'm glad you liked it.
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.980]  Sure, for sure.
[16:14.980 --> 16:21.980]  Our friend said that Colorado had a little technical glitch on the computer,
[16:21.980 --> 16:23.980]  so I hope everything's legit and it looks fine here.
[16:23.980 --> 16:24.980]  We're going to keep recording.
[16:24.980 --> 16:28.980]  But Miss Nadia Dabbs Facebooked saying that she wasn't having a good time in Colorado
[16:28.980 --> 16:29.980]  and that there weren't any good dabs.
[16:29.980 --> 16:33.980]  So Kevin and I stopped by her booth, and we corrected that issue quite promptly.
[16:33.980 --> 16:35.980]  She looked very happy when we left.
[16:35.980 --> 16:37.980]  I think she mentioned something on her Instagram.
[16:37.980 --> 16:40.980]  She might have said that those were the best dabs she had in Colorado.
[16:40.980 --> 16:45.980]  She posted your rig and your Chewbacca and mentioned the dabs in the comment,
[16:45.980 --> 16:46.980]  which was cool.
[16:46.980 --> 16:47.980]  Big up to Nadia Dabbs.
[16:47.980 --> 16:51.980]  If you guys want to follow some gorgeous women on Facebook or Instagram,
[16:51.980 --> 16:56.980]  she's Nadia Dabbs, and she's Miss Nadia Noir on Instagram, I think.
[16:56.980 --> 16:57.980]  So find her.
[16:57.980 --> 16:58.980]  She's gorgeous.
[16:58.980 --> 17:00.980]  She used to be the tiny rebel.
[17:00.980 --> 17:02.980]  Yeah, she changes it up, so it's hard to.
[17:02.980 --> 17:05.980]  Some people may know her as one thing.
[17:05.980 --> 17:08.980]  If you go to Facebook and look for Nadia Dabbs, you'll find her that way.
[17:08.980 --> 17:09.980]  Yeah, for sure.
[17:09.980 --> 17:11.980]  You just got a fat plug from us, Miss Nadia Dabbs.
[17:11.980 --> 17:15.980]  So I'm going to grab my rig here.
[17:15.980 --> 17:17.980]  I've been watching this dab for a second.
[17:17.980 --> 17:23.980]  I'm going to hit this 14 millimeter highly educated flux nail.
[17:23.980 --> 17:24.980]  Shameless plug there.
[17:24.980 --> 17:28.980]  Yeah, I just hit the duality.
[17:28.980 --> 17:30.980]  It's a brand new duality, bro, seasoned to perfection.
[17:30.980 --> 17:33.980]  I think I seasoned that sucker just right.
[17:33.980 --> 17:34.980]  I think I got it perfect.
[17:34.980 --> 17:38.980]  My boy TaskRock taught me really nicely how to season a nail.
[17:38.980 --> 17:41.980]  All right, you talk for a minute about something while I take a dab of this.
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.980]  Certainly while you take a dab of this.
[17:44.980 --> 17:48.980]  I'm going to have to go a little bit longer because I still got to get the nail on.
[17:48.980 --> 17:52.980]  Hey, if you guys work at the cannabis company and you saw me and you've got pictures of Kevin or I,
[17:52.980 --> 17:53.980]  tweet those, please.
[17:53.980 --> 17:55.980]  Instagram them, tweet them, tag me.
[17:55.980 --> 17:56.980]  At Hydrogenetics.
[17:56.980 --> 17:57.980]  Good laugh, bro.
[17:57.980 --> 18:00.980]  That was some fun shit.
[18:00.980 --> 18:04.980]  I didn't think I would have that good of a time, but for me personally,
[18:04.980 --> 18:09.980]  any time I walk into a spot and see Rev, Jaron, and Charles chilling,
[18:09.980 --> 18:12.980]  I usually just pop a chair up next to him.
[18:12.980 --> 18:14.980]  It's usually a pretty good day.
[18:14.980 --> 18:19.980]  So, I didn't really fail there.
[18:19.980 --> 18:21.980]  Much loved Adam Dunner in the hood lab.
[18:21.980 --> 18:22.980]  Yeah.
[18:22.980 --> 18:24.980]  That was a cool little after party you guys threw there.
[18:24.980 --> 18:27.980]  They always throw fun, chill, little cannabis parties, dude.
[18:27.980 --> 18:30.980]  They're always fun and chill and complete.
[18:30.980 --> 18:36.980]  It's just a nice little get together that happens at the lab.
[18:36.980 --> 18:39.980]  I see you in my headphones, but you're not showing up on the computer here.
[18:39.980 --> 18:40.980]  There you are.
[18:40.980 --> 18:41.980]  Well, that's me.
[18:41.980 --> 18:45.980]  Guys, I apologize if there's some bullshit technical issues in this episode.
[18:45.980 --> 18:46.980]  The computer might be high.
[18:46.980 --> 18:47.980]  We're dabbing.
[18:47.980 --> 18:48.980]  We'll just give it some excuses.
[18:48.980 --> 18:51.980]  Yeah, the computer might have had a 420 too.
[18:51.980 --> 18:55.980]  I'm pretty sure the computer enjoyed 420 as well.
[18:55.980 --> 18:58.980]  So, Kevin and I went to this little restaurant in Denver.
[18:58.980 --> 18:59.980]  That was so tight.
[18:59.980 --> 19:00.980]  Siri took us there.
[19:00.980 --> 19:01.980]  That was cool.
[19:01.980 --> 19:02.980]  I thought it was funny.
[19:02.980 --> 19:03.980]  Thanks, Siri.
[19:03.980 --> 19:05.980]  It was called the Cherry Tomato, and it was delicious.
[19:05.980 --> 19:07.980]  I had gnocchi, and I would recommend it to anybody.
[19:07.980 --> 19:08.980]  It was so good.
[19:08.980 --> 19:10.980]  The price was reasonable.
[19:10.980 --> 19:12.980]  It was just delicious.
[19:12.980 --> 19:13.980]  The waiter was super cool.
[19:13.980 --> 19:16.980]  Whatever the waiter's name was, that was super cool.
[19:16.980 --> 19:17.980]  It was awesome indeed.
[19:17.980 --> 19:20.980]  There were some cute waitresses that worked around there.
[19:20.980 --> 19:24.980]  Go check that place out if you're ever around.
[19:24.980 --> 19:27.980]  So, there are some updates available from my computer, it's telling me.
[19:27.980 --> 19:33.980]  So, if this episode is a little bit sketchy, blame it on Mac trying to fucking force some updates on me right now.
[19:33.980 --> 19:34.980]  All right.
[19:34.980 --> 19:42.980]  I thought it was funny at that restaurant because everybody, not everybody, most of the folks in there looked like they were on dates.
[19:42.980 --> 19:47.980]  It was guys in collared shirts with their hair really nice and some smoking ladies in that place.
[19:47.980 --> 19:48.980]  Man.
[19:48.980 --> 19:50.980]  But everybody looked like they were on a nice fancy date.
[19:50.980 --> 19:54.980]  And then there was us, our two high asses in black hoodies, baseball caps.
[19:54.980 --> 19:57.980]  Kevin's got like 20 pins on his head, and I'm sure we just reaped a dank.
[19:57.980 --> 19:59.980]  We just came from the cannabis club.
[19:59.980 --> 20:00.980]  Yeah.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.980]  And nobody even acted funny.
[20:02.980 --> 20:04.980]  Nobody said a word to us about anything.
[20:04.980 --> 20:05.980]  They all treated us really cool.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.980]  We got to grub, and it was delicious.
[20:07.980 --> 20:09.980]  Dude, my hotel.
[20:09.980 --> 20:15.980]  I got to my hotel the first night, and before I walked in, it smelled like a fucking dispensary in there.
[20:15.980 --> 20:17.980]  It just reaped a sticky dank.
[20:17.980 --> 20:22.980]  You could hear as I walked down the hall to my hotel room, I could just hear people choking and coughing all the way down.
[20:22.980 --> 20:24.980]  It was freaking hilarious.
[20:24.980 --> 20:26.980]  That's hilarious.
[20:26.980 --> 20:27.980]  Oh, sorry.
[20:27.980 --> 20:29.980]  I'm coughing.
[20:29.980 --> 20:33.980]  There was a big sign saying that you can't sell cannabis in the hotel.
[20:33.980 --> 20:36.980]  It's illegal to display or purchase cannabis in the hotel.
[20:36.980 --> 20:38.980]  They were talking about all kinds of Colorado state laws.
[20:38.980 --> 20:42.980]  Every corner I went to had another poster that was worded differently.
[20:42.980 --> 20:44.980]  I thought it was funny, but nobody cared.
[20:44.980 --> 20:46.980]  I dabbed the shit out of that place.
[20:48.980 --> 20:49.980]  All right.
[20:49.980 --> 20:50.980]  I'm dabbed out, dude.
[20:50.980 --> 20:51.980]  That dab worked.
[20:51.980 --> 20:53.980]  My voice sounds funny in my headphones.
[20:55.980 --> 20:56.980]  That's fucking funny to me.
[20:56.980 --> 20:57.980]  Sorry.
[20:59.980 --> 21:00.980]  All right.
[21:00.980 --> 21:01.980]  I'm going to press pause.
[21:01.980 --> 21:04.980]  We're going to play a commercial because I'm not sure that this is recording properly.
[21:04.980 --> 21:05.980]  Hang on for a second.
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.980]  We'll do an ad.
[21:07.980 --> 21:10.980]  This portion of the iGrow Culture podcast is brought to you by Oil Slick.
[21:10.980 --> 21:12.980]  Oil Slick, tools to help you concentrate.
[21:12.980 --> 21:14.980]  Check out oilslickpad.com for more information.
[21:17.980 --> 21:18.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.980]  I think we fixed all of our technical difficulties.
[21:21.980 --> 21:22.980]  We're having too much fun.
[21:22.980 --> 21:24.980]  Yeah, we took a little break, took a couple dabs.
[21:24.980 --> 21:26.980]  We've got a commercial going for you guys.
[21:26.980 --> 21:27.980]  I hope you like that.
[21:30.980 --> 21:31.980]  All right.
[21:31.980 --> 21:32.980]  I think everything's working.
[21:33.980 --> 21:34.980]  I'm satisfied.
[21:34.980 --> 21:35.980]  Sorry about that, guys.
[21:35.980 --> 21:37.980]  I hate to break up a show like that.
[21:38.980 --> 21:42.980]  I guess it's time to read the winners of the High Times Cannabis Cup.
[21:42.980 --> 21:43.980]  We haven't gotten to that part yet.
[21:43.980 --> 21:44.980]  We talked a lot about the Cannabis Cup.
[21:44.980 --> 21:45.980]  We rambled on and on and on.
[21:47.980 --> 21:51.980]  The High Times Cannabis Cup, this is actually High Times' 40th birthday.
[21:52.980 --> 21:53.980]  Happy birthday, High Times.
[21:53.980 --> 21:54.980]  Yes, indeed.
[21:54.980 --> 21:56.980]  You guys are getting a lot of free ads from me today.
[21:56.980 --> 21:59.980]  Congratulations to all the winners and people who placed, by the way.
[22:00.980 --> 22:04.980]  I think I need to turn down some task rock just a tiny bit, and then we'll announce some winners.
[22:05.980 --> 22:06.980]  All right.
[22:07.980 --> 22:08.980]  They did a lot of awards.
[22:08.980 --> 22:09.980]  They did edibles.
[22:09.980 --> 22:10.980]  They did concentrates.
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.980]  They did booths.
[22:11.980 --> 22:13.980]  We're just going to read you the flowers.
[22:14.980 --> 22:16.980]  They did two separate categories.
[22:16.980 --> 22:19.980]  There was the medical and the U.S. competition.
[22:19.980 --> 22:22.980]  The medical competition was only available to, of course, medical dispensaries.
[22:23.980 --> 22:28.980]  The U.S. competition was available to anyone 18 and over that could afford to enter and felt like doing so.
[22:30.980 --> 22:31.980]  The best medical hybrid.
[22:31.980 --> 22:34.980]  Hybrid is a not indica, not sativa, but a nice blend.
[22:35.980 --> 22:37.980]  It can't be more than 70% leaning either way.
[22:38.980 --> 22:42.980]  So third place, best hybrid, best medical hybrid, Golden Goat from The Green Solution.
[22:43.980 --> 22:45.980]  Second place, Chem Crush from Le Contes.
[22:46.980 --> 22:49.980]  First place, Pure Power Plant from Good Meds Network.
[22:50.980 --> 22:51.980]  So that's your best hybrid, Pure Power Plant.
[22:53.980 --> 22:56.980]  For the U.S. competition, the best U.S. hybrid.
[22:56.980 --> 22:59.980]  Third place, Cinderella 99x White from Natural Remedies.
[23:00.980 --> 23:03.980]  Second place, best U.S. hybrid was Colorado Chem from Cannibals.
[23:04.980 --> 23:08.980]  And first place U.S. hybrid was Cookies and Cream from Exotic Genetics.
[23:09.980 --> 23:11.980]  Not a big surprise to see the word cookies in there.
[23:12.980 --> 23:13.980]  Cookies like to win awards.
[23:14.980 --> 23:17.980]  You know, side note, I'm surprised we did not see Kyle Cushman this year.
[23:18.980 --> 23:19.980]  He was there.
[23:20.980 --> 23:21.980]  I didn't see him or...
[23:22.980 --> 23:23.980]  You didn't see him at the booth?
[23:23.980 --> 23:25.980]  I was even more surprised that I did not see him on stage.
[23:26.980 --> 23:27.980]  He didn't win anything.
[23:28.980 --> 23:30.980]  I didn't see him there, but I was even more surprised that he didn't win anything.
[23:31.980 --> 23:33.980]  Usually we see Kyle Cushman on stage a lot.
[23:34.980 --> 23:37.980]  A lot of the winners had some TGA stuff in it though.
[23:38.980 --> 23:40.980]  Alright, so now we'll move on to the sativa category.
[23:41.980 --> 23:42.980]  The best medical sativa.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.980]  Third place, Cherry Pie from The Clinic.
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.980]  I don't smoke a lot of flowers.
[23:48.980 --> 23:50.980]  That cherry pie is the bomb.
[23:50.980 --> 23:52.980]  I don't shop at a lot of dispensaries, but if I had to go to a dispensary,
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.980]  The Clinic would be one of the very few places that I would go to.
[23:56.980 --> 23:57.980]  So shout out to The Clinic.
[23:58.980 --> 23:59.980]  Third place, Cherry Pie.
[24:00.980 --> 24:01.980]  Best medical sativa.
[24:02.980 --> 24:04.980]  Second place, Durban Poison from Denver Relief.
[24:05.980 --> 24:08.980]  Once again, another impressive facility and another impressive strain.
[24:09.980 --> 24:11.980]  There are very few places that I really like to shop.
[24:12.980 --> 24:13.980]  Because I mean, I've got my own hookups.
[24:14.980 --> 24:17.980]  I don't need to go shopping, but Denver Relief, they've always been a great place to shop.
[24:17.980 --> 24:18.980]  They've been around for a long, long time.
[24:19.980 --> 24:20.980]  We used to go get that biodiesel.
[24:21.980 --> 24:22.980]  Unless it was the fire.
[24:23.980 --> 24:27.980]  So, first place, best medical sativa in the US High Times Cannabis Cup
[24:28.980 --> 24:31.980]  was Jilly Bean number one from Standing Akimbo.
[24:32.980 --> 24:34.980]  So shout out Jilly Bean, TGA Subcooled Genetics.
[24:35.980 --> 24:37.980]  Best sativa in the medical cup.
[24:38.980 --> 24:39.980]  Let me find more music.
[24:40.980 --> 24:42.980]  Alright, so we're going to go ahead and play a little bit of music.
[24:42.980 --> 24:44.980]  Best sativa in the medical cup.
[24:45.980 --> 24:46.980]  Let me find more music.
[24:47.980 --> 24:48.980]  I'm just going to play more TASC.
[24:49.980 --> 24:50.980]  There will be something on the screen.
[24:55.560 --> 24:56.560]  Oh no, here we go.
[24:57.560 --> 24:58.560]  It's playing, I promise.
[24:59.560 --> 25:00.560]  It's going, see?
[25:01.560 --> 25:02.560]  Alright.
[25:03.560 --> 25:04.560]  Best US sativas.
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.560]  Second place was Twista from The Green Solution.
[25:08.560 --> 25:11.560]  Second place, Super Silver Haze from Life is Good Healing.
[25:12.560 --> 25:14.560]  I've always liked some Super Silver Haze if it's done properly.
[25:14.560 --> 25:17.560]  And then first place was Ghost Train Haze from Green Man Cannabis,
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  which is really cool because that's our friends at Rare Dankness,
[25:21.560 --> 25:22.560]  which is a Colorado brand.
[25:23.560 --> 25:25.560]  Always like to see fellow Coloradans doing good things.
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.560]  They were suffering what they were calling the Colorado Curse.
[25:30.560 --> 25:33.560]  Rare Dankness wins cups everywhere they go except Colorado.
[25:34.560 --> 25:36.560]  In the past couple years we've seen Scott from Rare Dankness
[25:37.560 --> 25:39.560]  have a look of frustration at the end of the event.
[25:40.560 --> 25:41.560]  And they finally broke free from the Colorado Curse.
[25:41.560 --> 25:44.560]  So congratulations Rare Dankness and Green Man Cannabis
[25:45.560 --> 25:46.560]  with your Ghost Train Haze victory.
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.560]  So Best Medical Indica is where we are now.
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.560]  Third place, Best Medical Indica.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.560]  Denver Maple from Ballpark Holistic Dispensary.
[25:57.560 --> 25:59.560]  I don't know anything about the dispensary or the strain,
[26:00.560 --> 26:01.560]  but we should check it out.
[26:02.560 --> 26:05.560]  Second place, Rascal OG from Colorado Alternative Medicine.
[26:06.560 --> 26:08.560]  Rascal OG has always been a tasty fucking dank, dank strain.
[26:08.560 --> 26:11.560]  And Cam has always been one of the few dispensaries I would shop at.
[26:12.560 --> 26:14.560]  It would be probably the clinic,
[26:15.560 --> 26:17.560]  fucking Denver Relief,
[26:18.560 --> 26:19.560]  Cam,
[26:20.560 --> 26:21.560]  and sometimes Kind Love.
[26:22.560 --> 26:24.560]  Or like the four or five, four places I'd shop at.
[26:25.560 --> 26:26.560]  There's another one.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.560]  There are several branches of the clinic,
[26:29.560 --> 26:30.560]  so I'd go to one or two of those if I had to.
[26:31.560 --> 26:32.560]  So Rascal OG from Cam.
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.560]  And then first place, Best Medical Indica
[26:35.560 --> 26:37.560]  would be Larry OG from MMJ America.
[26:38.560 --> 26:41.560]  That was a collab with Cali Connection and MMJ America.
[26:42.560 --> 26:44.560]  It's good to see Larry OG taking more awards.
[26:45.560 --> 26:46.560]  It's a dank ass strain.
[26:47.560 --> 26:48.560]  Grow that shit.
[26:49.560 --> 26:50.560]  That's good stuff.
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.560]  Alright, Best US Indica.
[26:53.560 --> 26:55.560]  Excuse me, I'm all dabbed out of my throat.
[26:56.560 --> 26:57.560]  It's reflecting such.
[26:58.560 --> 27:00.560]  So third place, Best US Indica.
[27:01.560 --> 27:02.560]  MK Ultra from The Green Solution.
[27:02.560 --> 27:03.560]  That's a great strain.
[27:04.560 --> 27:05.560]  I don't know that dispensary,
[27:06.560 --> 27:07.560]  but MK Ultra is definitely a great strain.
[27:08.560 --> 27:09.560]  That's OG Kush and a haze if I'm correct.
[27:10.560 --> 27:11.560]  G13 is what it is.
[27:12.560 --> 27:13.560]  OG Kush and G13.
[27:14.560 --> 27:15.560]  So that's got a nice little mix there.
[27:16.560 --> 27:18.560]  Second place, Grand Daddy Purple from Cannibals.
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.560]  People are going to hate on me.
[27:21.560 --> 27:22.560]  I've never liked purple weed.
[27:23.560 --> 27:24.560]  Not the color purple,
[27:25.560 --> 27:26.560]  but strains that are from the purple line.
[27:27.560 --> 27:28.560]  It just always tastes, it tastes like CBD to me,
[27:29.560 --> 27:30.560]  I guess is what I've learned.
[27:30.560 --> 27:32.560]  And I've never been a huge fan of that CBD flavor.
[27:33.560 --> 27:34.560]  To each his own.
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.560]  You can hate on me if you'd like.
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.560]  That's at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[27:39.560 --> 27:41.560]  First place, Best US Indica.
[27:42.560 --> 27:44.560]  South Central LA from Colorado Alternative Medicine
[27:45.560 --> 27:47.560]  and Root Cellar Seeds.
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.560]  South Central LA from Cam and Root Cellar Seeds.
[27:53.560 --> 27:54.560]  So Root Cellar Seeds gave Cam some seeds.
[27:55.560 --> 27:56.560]  Cam grew the shit out of it.
[27:57.560 --> 27:58.560]  It's called South Central LA.
[27:58.560 --> 27:59.560]  And it won Best US Indica.
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.560]  So that's pretty chill.
[28:02.560 --> 28:03.560]  All right, got a couple more.
[28:04.560 --> 28:05.560]  People's Choice Cup.
[28:06.560 --> 28:07.560]  This is for Hash.
[28:08.560 --> 28:09.560]  The third place, People's Choice Cup,
[28:10.560 --> 28:11.560]  which is the people voted on this apparently.
[28:12.560 --> 28:14.560]  Third place, K1 Shatter from New Age Medical.
[28:15.560 --> 28:17.560]  Second place, Jilly Bean Shatter from 710 Labs
[28:18.560 --> 28:19.560]  BudMed Health Center.
[28:21.560 --> 28:22.560]  Anything with that jilly bean flavor,
[28:23.560 --> 28:24.560]  tangy flavor, grapefruit flavor,
[28:25.560 --> 28:26.560]  I will take a shot at.
[28:26.560 --> 28:27.560]  Yes, please.
[28:28.560 --> 28:29.560]  That shit is always so tasty.
[28:30.560 --> 28:31.560]  In fact, let me read first place.
[28:32.560 --> 28:33.560]  And there was a lovely lady.
[28:34.560 --> 28:35.560]  I don't know your name.
[28:36.560 --> 28:37.560]  We bumped into you close to the end of Sunday night.
[28:38.560 --> 28:39.560]  And you gave me a little parchment
[28:40.560 --> 28:41.560]  with this grapefruit dab in there.
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.560]  And there were probably three or four dabs of my size.
[28:46.560 --> 28:47.560]  Holy crap, honey.
[28:48.560 --> 28:49.560]  Thank you.
[28:50.560 --> 28:51.560]  This is some delicious dabs.
[28:52.560 --> 28:53.560]  I was gifted a lot of cool things.
[28:54.560 --> 28:55.560]  And so far, this is the one I've enjoyed the most.
[28:56.560 --> 28:57.560]  Yeah.
[28:58.560 --> 28:59.560]  Yeah, these dabs are delicious.
[29:00.560 --> 29:01.560]  I'll split this in half with you.
[29:02.560 --> 29:03.560]  I'm pretty sure you got some of it.
[29:04.560 --> 29:05.560]  I didn't.
[29:06.560 --> 29:07.560]  I'll give you a dab of what's here.
[29:08.560 --> 29:09.560]  It was tasty, though.
[29:10.560 --> 29:11.560]  I gave you a dab at the thing.
[29:12.560 --> 29:13.560]  It was delicious.
[29:14.560 --> 29:15.560]  All right, so first place, People's Cup Hash.
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.560]  It's a Golden Goat Shatter.
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.560]  Gotta love that Golden Goat Shatter.
[29:20.560 --> 29:22.560]  By Infusions, powered by The Green Solutions.
[29:23.560 --> 29:25.560]  So shout out to The Green Solution
[29:26.560 --> 29:27.560]  for the Golden Goat Shatter.
[29:28.560 --> 29:29.560]  I fricking love some Golden Goat Shatter.
[29:30.560 --> 29:31.560]  Yeah, Golden Goat's a great strain.
[29:32.560 --> 29:33.560]  It's good for migraines, good for seizures,
[29:34.560 --> 29:35.560]  good for anxiety.
[29:36.560 --> 29:37.560]  It's not good for naps.
[29:38.560 --> 29:39.560]  If you need to take a nap, do not smoke some Golden Goat.
[29:40.560 --> 29:41.560]  That's one of the strains that,
[29:42.560 --> 29:43.560]  if you need to get the dishes done
[29:44.560 --> 29:45.560]  and you're not motivated, puff a little Golden Goat.
[29:46.560 --> 29:47.560]  You might get wired up enough to go and do the dishes.
[29:48.560 --> 29:49.560]  What do you got in that dabber, homie?
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.560]  I'm just looking at it.
[29:52.560 --> 29:53.560]  You're just looking?
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.560]  I got a lemon sativa blend.
[29:55.560 --> 29:56.560]  Ooh, that's some tastiness.
[29:57.560 --> 29:58.560]  Everybody at the Cup this week loved it.
[29:59.560 --> 30:00.560]  I know, so much.
[30:01.560 --> 30:02.560]  I loved it so much.
[30:03.560 --> 30:04.560]  You guys better look out for us
[30:05.560 --> 30:06.560]  when the Secret Cup comes.
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.560]  We're gonna crush.
[30:09.560 --> 30:10.560]  Oh, man.
[30:11.560 --> 30:12.560]  You should knock that dab off there, or do it,
[30:13.560 --> 30:14.560]  and then I'll give you this grapefruit dab
[30:15.560 --> 30:16.560]  that's super tasty.
[30:17.560 --> 30:18.560]  I'll save this one, I'll do that grapefruit.
[30:19.560 --> 30:20.560]  There you go, there's that one.
[30:21.560 --> 30:22.560]  I'll take that carb cap.
[30:23.560 --> 30:24.560]  So I got three more words to read while...
[30:25.560 --> 30:26.560]  We're in the middle of something right now.
[30:27.560 --> 30:28.560]  Yeah, I know we're in the middle.
[30:29.560 --> 30:30.560]  I got a mouse on the computer
[30:31.560 --> 30:32.560]  and I just scroll the mouse to where I am.
[30:33.560 --> 30:34.560]  And that's my secret for finding where I need to be.
[30:35.560 --> 30:37.560]  So we're gonna crush at the Secret Cup, so there.
[30:38.560 --> 30:39.560]  So there.
[30:40.560 --> 30:42.560]  I think we figured out what we're doing.
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.560]  We'll talk about it after the show, off the air.
[30:46.560 --> 30:47.560]  Oh, yeah.
[30:48.560 --> 30:49.560]  It's a secret.
[30:50.560 --> 30:51.560]  So, the People's Cup, flowers.
[30:51.560 --> 30:52.560]  This is flowers.
[30:53.560 --> 30:54.560]  For the people that...
[30:55.560 --> 30:56.560]  I gotta explain two things, carb cap and flowers.
[30:57.560 --> 30:58.560]  Now I ran myself into a circle.
[30:59.560 --> 31:01.560]  So, flowers, for the people that aren't from Colorado
[31:02.560 --> 31:03.560]  and aren't hip to all of our cool lingo,
[31:04.560 --> 31:05.560]  flowers are pre-run.
[31:06.560 --> 31:08.560]  I just fucked you again.
[31:09.560 --> 31:10.560]  My buddy Adam Mill calls it pre-run
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.560]  because flowers are buds.
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.560]  Flowers and concentrates, flowers and hash.
[31:15.560 --> 31:16.560]  Flowers are just buds.
[31:17.560 --> 31:18.560]  We call it flowers, it's the flower, the plant.
[31:19.560 --> 31:20.560]  We just call it that here in Colorado.
[31:21.560 --> 31:22.560]  It's just a circle.
[31:23.560 --> 31:24.560]  A lot of the guys call it pre-run.
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.560]  I'm not sure how I feel about it.
[31:27.560 --> 31:28.560]  I know, I call it flowers.
[31:29.560 --> 31:30.560]  It feels disrespectful to my plant that I just spent
[31:31.560 --> 31:32.560]  three or four months trying to nurture
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.560]  and then you guys are like, pre-run.
[31:35.560 --> 31:36.560]  But that's just my baby.
[31:37.560 --> 31:38.560]  Alright, so, People's Cup for flowers.
[31:39.560 --> 31:40.560]  Third place, sour diesel from the
[31:41.560 --> 31:42.560]  Walking Raven Retail Marijuana Center.
[31:43.560 --> 31:45.560]  Who does not love some good sour diesel?
[31:46.560 --> 31:48.560]  If I smoke sour d, it makes my head spin.
[31:49.560 --> 31:50.560]  It's like, I go fucking retarded.
[31:51.560 --> 31:52.560]  I go full retard.
[31:53.560 --> 31:54.560]  I go even worse than full retard.
[31:55.560 --> 31:56.560]  I go like ADD, I forget what I'm doing.
[31:57.560 --> 31:58.560]  I start nine projects, I turn on the Xbox,
[31:59.560 --> 32:00.560]  don't even play it.
[32:01.560 --> 32:02.560]  I make some food and don't even eat it.
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.560]  I just go nuts.
[32:05.560 --> 32:07.560]  Second place, Death Star from New Age Medical.
[32:08.560 --> 32:09.560]  Death Star's a good strain.
[32:10.560 --> 32:11.560]  The cut that was going around Denver,
[32:12.560 --> 32:15.560]  it's got this really, in a good way,
[32:16.560 --> 32:19.560]  it smells like burnt rubber and kush.
[32:19.560 --> 32:21.560]  And it tastes like dirty kush in your mouth.
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.560]  And I love it.
[32:24.560 --> 32:25.560]  It's a good thing.
[32:26.560 --> 32:27.560]  If you're into that good kushy, dirty, earthy smell,
[32:28.560 --> 32:29.560]  that Death Star that goes around Colorado,
[32:30.560 --> 32:31.560]  the Denver area, that's a good cut
[32:32.560 --> 32:33.560]  if you can find that one.
[32:34.560 --> 32:35.560]  Alright, first place, People's Choice Cup for flowers.
[32:36.560 --> 32:37.560]  First place was Presidential Kush
[32:38.560 --> 32:39.560]  from The Green Solution.
[32:40.560 --> 32:41.560]  There are a couple breeders that work with cuts
[32:42.560 --> 32:43.560]  they call Presidential Kush,
[32:44.560 --> 32:45.560]  so I can't shout out any breeders.
[32:46.560 --> 32:47.560]  I don't know which one that came from.
[32:47.560 --> 32:48.560]  Presidential Kush, Green Solution,
[32:49.560 --> 32:50.560]  was a People's Choice.
[32:51.560 --> 32:52.560]  That means people liked it, people voted.
[32:53.560 --> 32:54.560]  Go smoke some of that shit and see what you think.
[32:55.560 --> 32:56.560]  No? Alright.
[32:57.560 --> 32:59.560]  That was the High Times winners list there.
[33:00.560 --> 33:01.560]  I want to find the one that Joey won
[33:02.560 --> 33:03.560]  so I can read it properly.
[33:04.560 --> 33:05.560]  Our friends from Natural Mystic Caregivers
[33:06.560 --> 33:07.560]  took home an award.
[33:08.560 --> 33:09.560]  And I'm looking for it.
[33:10.560 --> 33:11.560]  They took home two awards.
[33:12.560 --> 33:13.560]  Here it is, Best Medical Edible.
[33:14.560 --> 33:15.560]  Mystic CBD Capsules from Natural Mystic
[33:15.560 --> 33:16.560]  Cannabis Caregivers.
[33:17.560 --> 33:20.560]  Big up to Joey from Natural Mystic Caregivers.
[33:21.560 --> 33:22.560]  He hooked me up with a few of those
[33:23.560 --> 33:24.560]  and they were the last ones he had.
[33:25.560 --> 33:26.560]  He said he was going to hook me up with some more
[33:27.560 --> 33:28.560]  but they were the last ones he had
[33:29.560 --> 33:31.560]  so I could give to my pops for his stuff
[33:32.560 --> 33:33.560]  that he's going through.
[33:34.560 --> 33:35.560]  So big thanks to that dude.
[33:36.560 --> 33:37.560]  He always has a real kind heart
[33:38.560 --> 33:39.560]  and I always give him back to the industry 100%.
[33:40.560 --> 33:41.560]  So it's good to see him win some stuff too.
[33:41.560 --> 33:43.560]  Shelly from that shop is a cancer survivor.
[33:44.560 --> 33:46.560]  So you can see the love they put into that.
[33:47.560 --> 33:48.560]  Cannabis saved her life
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.560]  and she gives that back every day
[33:51.560 --> 33:52.560]  being involved in what she does so much.
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.560]  So much love and respect to Natural Mystic
[33:55.560 --> 33:56.560]  Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[33:57.560 --> 34:00.560]  They also won Best Medical Non-Solvent Hatch
[34:01.560 --> 34:03.560]  for first place with the Blueberry Waltz.
[34:04.560 --> 34:05.560]  That's awesome.
[34:06.560 --> 34:07.560]  Non-solvent hatch.
[34:08.560 --> 34:09.560]  That's killing it.
[34:09.560 --> 34:10.560]  You're my hash guy bro.
[34:11.560 --> 34:12.560]  We're both dabbed out here a little bit
[34:13.560 --> 34:14.560]  but explain non-solvent hash.
[34:15.560 --> 34:16.560]  Non-solvent hash is just
[34:17.560 --> 34:18.560]  they don't use any solvents.
[34:19.560 --> 34:21.560]  Nothing is dissolved in the plant matter.
[34:22.560 --> 34:23.560]  They essentially use cold temperatures
[34:24.560 --> 34:25.560]  and ice to freeze,
[34:26.560 --> 34:27.560]  keep plant matter frozen
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.560]  and knock the trichomes off of the plant
[34:31.560 --> 34:34.560]  and to be able to separate using filters
[34:35.560 --> 34:37.560]  the trichome heads from the trichome tails.
[34:37.560 --> 34:40.560]  And then they make pure forms of ice wax.
[34:41.560 --> 34:43.560]  Ice wax and grease and juice.
[34:44.560 --> 34:45.560]  After it's all extracted
[34:46.560 --> 34:48.560]  they lay it out thin and flat on parchment
[34:49.560 --> 34:50.560]  and dry it for several days.
[34:51.560 --> 34:52.560]  So there's no chemicals used in it?
[34:53.560 --> 34:54.560]  No.
[34:54.560 --> 34:55.560]  Only water?
[34:55.560 --> 34:56.560]  Just water.
[34:57.560 --> 34:58.560]  So the other option is solvent hash
[34:59.560 --> 35:00.560]  which would usually be BHO
[35:01.560 --> 35:02.560]  or butane honey oil which is made with CO2.
[35:03.560 --> 35:04.560]  The BHO is made with butane
[35:05.560 --> 35:06.560]  and the CO2 is made with compressed air.
[35:07.560 --> 35:08.560]  Compressed CO2 of course.
[35:09.560 --> 35:10.560]  And there's iso that's made with isopropyl alcohol.
[35:11.560 --> 35:12.560]  So this is non-solvent
[35:13.560 --> 35:14.560]  which means it's made with essentially ice and water.
[35:15.560 --> 35:16.560]  And some people, I'm going to cut you off,
[35:17.560 --> 35:18.560]  don't even go there,
[35:19.560 --> 35:20.560]  you're going to say but water is a solvent.
[35:21.560 --> 35:22.560]  Yes, we do understand that
[35:23.560 --> 35:24.560]  but in this case water is not being used as a solvent.
[35:25.560 --> 35:26.560]  I'm kind of quoting Nikiti.
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.560]  I'm giving credit to this statement right here to Nikiti.
[35:29.560 --> 35:30.560]  This is not my teachings.
[35:31.560 --> 35:32.560]  Nikiti has taught me that
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.560]  water is not being used as a solvent
[35:35.560 --> 35:36.560]  in water hash or ice hash.
[35:37.560 --> 35:38.560]  It's a carrier and a carrier
[35:39.560 --> 35:40.560]  because what we're trying to do
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.560]  we're freezing the trichomes basically
[35:43.560 --> 35:44.560]  and you knock them off of the plant matter
[35:45.560 --> 35:46.560]  like how you get gum out of your hair.
[35:47.560 --> 35:48.560]  Remember back in the day you just freeze the gum
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.560]  and it comes out of your hair, kind of?
[35:51.560 --> 35:52.560]  It does the same thing.
[35:53.560 --> 35:54.560]  The trichomes and the oils will fall off of the plant
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.560]  and so you're not using it as a solvent.
[35:57.560 --> 35:58.560]  It's a carrier and it's not dissolving.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.560]  It's just there to freeze.
[36:01.560 --> 36:02.560]  And you're extracting it from the plant material.
[36:03.560 --> 36:04.560]  So I did that all,
[36:05.560 --> 36:06.560]  I probably said that all wrong
[36:07.560 --> 36:08.560]  but it's like you're washing something essentially.
[36:09.560 --> 36:10.560]  Shout out to Nikiti.
[36:11.560 --> 36:12.560]  He taught me better than that.
[36:13.560 --> 36:14.560]  I just can't remember exactly what he said.
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.560]  I should go Google it so I can get it right for him.
[36:17.560 --> 36:20.560]  But Nikiti is awesome at that solventless hash.
[36:21.560 --> 36:23.560]  He took second and then winning best US, wasn't he?
[36:24.560 --> 36:26.560]  He took second in medical and then won best US.
[36:27.560 --> 36:28.560]  Right here on the screen it says
[36:29.560 --> 36:30.560]  second place, sour lemon OG, solventless
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.560]  from essential extracts and trill alternatives.
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.560]  Nice, there you go.
[36:35.560 --> 36:36.560]  And then right here, best US non-solvent hash
[36:37.560 --> 36:38.560]  OG solventless wax from essential extracts
[36:39.560 --> 36:40.560]  and down with dirt.
[36:41.560 --> 36:42.560]  Shout out to down with dirt.
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.560]  He's a breeder and he's a cool little dude.
[36:45.560 --> 36:46.560]  He's always humble, he's always kind,
[36:47.560 --> 36:48.560]  he's always polite, he's always friendly.
[36:49.560 --> 36:50.560]  Whenever he sees me he's always got a pack of seeds
[36:51.560 --> 36:52.560]  and a high five for me.
[36:53.560 --> 36:54.560]  That's a cool little dude right there.
[36:55.560 --> 36:56.560]  Look out for down with your seeds.
[36:57.560 --> 36:58.560]  They're going to be doing some big things in the future.
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.560]  I predict it.
[37:01.560 --> 37:02.560]  I predict that.
[37:03.560 --> 37:04.560]  So 420 weekend happened, right?
[37:05.560 --> 37:06.560]  Did anybody hear about that?
[37:07.560 --> 37:08.560]  No.
[37:09.560 --> 37:10.560]  Not only was there the Cannabis Cup,
[37:11.560 --> 37:12.560]  but there was also a big event
[37:13.560 --> 37:14.560]  at Civic Center Park in Denver.
[37:15.560 --> 37:16.560]  There were a few bands set up.
[37:17.560 --> 37:18.560]  There was actually an area where they were selling alcohol,
[37:19.560 --> 37:20.560]  which we ranted about that on the first,
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.560]  on the last podcast.
[37:23.560 --> 37:24.560]  We don't approve of that.
[37:25.560 --> 37:26.560]  I hope nobody drank.
[37:27.560 --> 37:28.560]  Kevin had a couple of friends that went to the event
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.560]  at Civic Center Park.
[37:31.560 --> 37:32.560]  How did you say that they felt about it?
[37:33.560 --> 37:34.560]  Yeah, the people I've talked to,
[37:35.560 --> 37:36.560]  everyone said pretty much it was really boring
[37:37.560 --> 37:38.560]  and very uncomfortable,
[37:39.560 --> 37:40.560]  unlike past years with all the fencing
[37:41.560 --> 37:42.560]  and security and all that stuff.
[37:43.560 --> 37:44.560]  They commented that it made them feel
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.560]  like they were in a prison yard.
[37:48.560 --> 37:50.560]  And they were extremely uncomfortable.
[37:51.560 --> 37:52.560]  I saw a tweet that said,
[37:53.560 --> 37:54.560]  with all of these barricades and things,
[37:55.560 --> 37:56.560]  if somebody shoots this year,
[37:57.560 --> 37:58.560]  all we're going to do is trample each other.
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.560]  Yeah.
[38:01.560 --> 38:02.560]  Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.
[38:03.560 --> 38:04.560]  I wasn't there.
[38:05.560 --> 38:06.560]  I can't judge it,
[38:07.560 --> 38:08.560]  but I had the wrong idea
[38:09.560 --> 38:10.560]  of how we need to have our cannabis events.
[38:11.560 --> 38:12.560]  Need to come look at the Cannabis Cup
[38:13.560 --> 38:14.560]  and see how that was done.
[38:15.560 --> 38:16.560]  I think there were 40,000 people there.
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.560]  There had to be 50.
[38:19.560 --> 38:20.560]  I'm going to guess.
[38:21.560 --> 38:22.560]  There were 40,000 people there,
[38:23.560 --> 38:24.560]  but this was a cannabis event.
[38:25.560 --> 38:26.560]  And everybody's friend did a cannabis event.
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.560]  If I would have been patient enough,
[38:29.560 --> 38:30.560]  we both would have gotten in with a wristband.
[38:31.560 --> 38:32.560]  You know what I mean?
[38:33.560 --> 38:34.560]  We just didn't want to hunt around
[38:35.560 --> 38:36.560]  and find the right people.
[38:37.560 --> 38:38.560]  There were 40,000 people in that place.
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.560]  I'm going to guess 40,000 to 50,000 people.
[38:41.560 --> 38:42.560]  And I didn't see any problems.
[38:43.560 --> 38:44.560]  There was no need for major security.
[38:45.560 --> 38:46.560]  And I can agree that too much security
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.560]  would be intimidating.
[38:49.560 --> 38:50.560]  You're just trying to get stoned and chill out,
[38:51.560 --> 38:52.560]  participate.
[38:53.560 --> 38:54.560]  They come dressed for war.
[38:55.560 --> 38:56.560]  We come dressed for a party.
[38:57.560 --> 38:58.560]  Right.
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.560]  All right.
[39:00.560 --> 39:01.560]  By late afternoon at the 420 rally in Denver,
[39:02.560 --> 39:03.560]  Denver police had issued 47 citations
[39:04.560 --> 39:05.560]  for public marijuana consumption
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.560]  for a number of other reasons.
[39:07.560 --> 39:08.560]  Denver Health Medical Center paramedics
[39:09.560 --> 39:10.560]  had treated 14 people,
[39:11.560 --> 39:12.560]  including three who were taken to detox.
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.560]  Were those people drunk or were they high?
[39:15.560 --> 39:16.560]  The people taken to detox.
[39:17.560 --> 39:18.560]  What the fuck is weed detox like?
[39:19.560 --> 39:20.560]  Yeah.
[39:21.560 --> 39:22.560]  You just sit in the corner and wish
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.560]  you had some cartoons to watch.
[39:25.560 --> 39:26.560]  Yeah.
[39:27.560 --> 39:28.560]  I hope those were...
[39:29.560 --> 39:30.560]  I hope that's for being too drunk.
[39:31.560 --> 39:32.560]  Yeah.
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.560]  The hospital's emergency room had treated
[39:35.560 --> 39:36.560]  a number of people for substance abuse.
[39:37.560 --> 39:38.560]  I would say it's people that aren't used
[39:39.560 --> 39:40.560]  to elevation and haven't drank enough water.
[39:41.560 --> 39:42.560]  Yeah.
[39:43.560 --> 39:44.560]  If you don't drink water in that elevation
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.560]  and you're dabbing, and it was hot.
[39:47.560 --> 39:48.560]  Yeah, dude.
[39:49.560 --> 39:50.560]  It was a nice hot day.
[39:51.560 --> 39:52.560]  I've got a wicked sunburn.
[39:53.560 --> 39:54.560]  I enjoy it.
[39:55.560 --> 39:56.560]  I feel like a kid again.
[39:57.560 --> 39:58.560]  I haven't been sunburned like this in years.
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.560]  So yeah, I would assume that a lot of those people are...
[40:01.560 --> 40:02.560]  I pick on Texas a lot.
[40:03.560 --> 40:04.560]  So let's say some people from Nebraska,
[40:05.560 --> 40:06.560]  they just got a ride down.
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.560]  They just ended up dropping like flies.
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.560]  By the way, what I'm reading comes from
[40:11.560 --> 40:12.560]  the Denver Post.
[40:13.560 --> 40:14.560]  Just want to give them some credit.
[40:15.560 --> 40:16.560]  So, uh...
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.560]  I don't want to read about this girl
[40:19.560 --> 40:20.560]  that got a ticket.
[40:21.560 --> 40:22.560]  I'm not going to say her name.
[40:23.560 --> 40:24.560]  She lit up her chillum on the outskirts of the rally
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.560]  just before police officers on bicycles rode by.
[40:27.560 --> 40:28.560]  They handed her a $150 ticket
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.560]  for public marijuana consumption,
[40:31.560 --> 40:32.560]  but they said,
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.560]  you know,
[40:34.560 --> 40:35.560]  so they were trying to be cool about it,
[40:36.560 --> 40:37.560]  but she was just right on the outskirts
[40:38.560 --> 40:39.560]  where they were like,
[40:40.560 --> 40:41.560]  hey, dumbass, we've got to give you a ticket, you know?
[40:42.560 --> 40:43.560]  So maybe that was not smart on her part.
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.490]  Doesn't seem like there were many events
[40:49.490 --> 40:50.490]  because of cannabis this year.
[40:51.490 --> 40:52.490]  I bet they were predicting a lot worse.
[40:53.490 --> 40:54.490]  Yeah, they're probably expecting us to rampage.
[40:55.490 --> 40:56.490]  Oh, that's what with all the police
[40:57.490 --> 40:58.490]  they had set up, dude.
[40:59.490 --> 41:00.490]  Like, this is ridiculous.
[41:01.490 --> 41:02.490]  You can see the police are like,
[41:02.490 --> 41:03.490]  there are guard towers.
[41:04.490 --> 41:05.490]  Like, yeah.
[41:06.490 --> 41:07.490]  That's why it was like a prison.
[41:08.490 --> 41:09.490]  Mm-hmm.
[41:10.490 --> 41:11.490]  That's no way to celebrate 420.
[41:12.490 --> 41:13.490]  This year's rally had fences around Civic Center
[41:14.490 --> 41:15.490]  designated entry points
[41:16.490 --> 41:17.490]  with pat-downs and bag checks,
[41:18.490 --> 41:19.490]  street closures,
[41:20.490 --> 41:21.490]  dozens of vendor booths
[41:22.490 --> 41:23.490]  from hemp energy drinks
[41:24.490 --> 41:25.490]  to festival favorites like the turkey leg guy
[41:26.490 --> 41:27.490]  and two stages for musical performance.
[41:28.490 --> 41:29.490]  After a shooting marred last year's rally,
[41:30.490 --> 41:31.490]  armed security forces were deployed
[41:32.490 --> 41:33.490]  and security guards this year
[41:34.490 --> 41:35.490]  walked through the crowd.
[41:36.490 --> 41:37.490]  At mid-afternoon, the air even smelled
[41:38.490 --> 41:39.490]  slightly less perfumed with pot than last year's,
[41:40.490 --> 41:41.490]  or than years past.
[41:42.490 --> 41:43.490]  That's kind of funny.
[41:44.490 --> 41:45.490]  So they were smoking less down there.
[41:46.490 --> 41:47.490]  Is it actually easier to smoke outside
[41:48.490 --> 41:49.490]  before it was legal?
[41:50.490 --> 41:51.490]  A person said the police are watching much more now.
[41:52.490 --> 41:53.490]  So maybe we kind of hosed ourselves
[41:54.490 --> 41:55.490]  by doing this, you guys, maybe.
[41:56.490 --> 41:57.490]  Nothing we can do about it now,
[41:58.490 --> 41:59.490]  but we've got to be careful,
[42:00.490 --> 42:01.490]  got to be responsible.
[42:02.490 --> 42:03.490]  So I think we should take a quick dab
[42:04.490 --> 42:05.490]  and then we should do the part of the show
[42:06.490 --> 42:07.490]  that we call Give Thanks.
[42:08.490 --> 42:09.490]  Yeah, let's dab and then we'll give thanks.
[42:10.490 --> 42:11.490]  It's something pretty special.
[42:12.490 --> 42:13.490]  Really special.
[42:14.490 --> 42:15.490]  All right, guys, we're going to find a cool song
[42:16.490 --> 42:17.490]  and take a dab with you.
[42:18.490 --> 42:19.490]  What are you in the mood to hear, Kev?
[42:20.490 --> 42:21.490]  Music.
[42:22.490 --> 42:23.490]  Music.
[42:24.490 --> 42:25.490]  You're such a smart ass, bro.
[42:26.490 --> 42:27.490]  Such a smart ass.
[42:28.490 --> 42:29.490]  Hey, if you guys have musical suggestions for us,
[42:30.490 --> 42:31.490]  go ahead and send them because Kevin
[42:32.490 --> 42:33.490]  is going to be here in a minute.
[42:34.490 --> 42:35.490]  All right, let's get some Steel Pulse.
[42:36.490 --> 42:37.490]  Let's get some Steel Pulse.
[42:38.490 --> 42:39.490]  Let's get some Steel Pulse.
[42:40.490 --> 42:41.490]  It helps if you spell it with an S.
[42:42.490 --> 42:43.490]  Those are torches that you hear.
[42:44.490 --> 42:45.490]  That's a torch that you hear.
[42:46.490 --> 42:52.670]  Here comes some Steel Pulse.
[42:53.670 --> 42:54.670]  As long as there's not a commercial.
[42:55.670 --> 42:56.670]  Look, it's a commercial.
[42:57.670 --> 42:58.670]  I'll hit mute.
[42:59.670 --> 43:00.670]  You can skip this ad in one second.
[43:01.670 --> 43:04.520]  There's a little bit of Steel Pulse
[43:05.520 --> 43:06.520]  while I take a dab.
[43:07.520 --> 43:08.520]  Damn, Kev, you're going in, bro.
[43:09.520 --> 43:10.520]  That's a dab.
[43:11.520 --> 43:12.520]  This dude's dropping probably a quarter gram
[43:13.520 --> 43:14.520]  onto the fucking domeless.
[43:15.520 --> 43:16.520]  Got the carb cap on there.
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.520]  Oh, his eyes are crossing,
[43:20.520 --> 43:21.520]  but he just keeps smoking.
[43:22.520 --> 43:23.520]  Yeah, nice, bro.
[43:24.520 --> 43:25.520]  You just clouded out the whole spot.
[43:26.520 --> 43:27.520]  No wonder my computer won't work.
[43:28.520 --> 43:29.520]  It's stoned.
[43:30.520 --> 43:31.520]  All right, I'm going to take a little dab here.
[43:32.520 --> 43:38.440]  You can cough into the microphone.
[43:39.440 --> 43:40.440]  Let people know we're still here.
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.350]  I'm going to hit the flux now.
[43:46.350 --> 43:47.350]  Check us out next week,
[43:48.350 --> 43:49.350]  because we're going to do a review
[43:50.350 --> 43:51.350]  of the Hive ceramic nail.
[43:52.350 --> 43:53.350]  It's domeless.
[43:54.350 --> 43:55.350]  It's white.
[43:56.350 --> 43:57.350]  It looks clean.
[43:58.350 --> 43:59.350]  We'll do a full review.
[44:00.350 --> 44:01.350]  I haven't taken enough dabs off of it
[44:02.350 --> 44:03.350]  to know what I think yet,
[44:04.350 --> 44:05.350]  so we'll hit it heavily next week on the show
[44:06.350 --> 44:07.350]  and I'll tell you what I think.
[44:08.350 --> 44:09.350]  Bring your favorite rig with it.
[44:10.350 --> 44:11.350]  I will bring my favorite rig with it.
[44:12.350 --> 44:13.350]  The one that it works best with.
[44:14.350 --> 44:15.350]  You know what I mean?
[44:16.350 --> 44:17.350]  I'm going to put some Steel Pulse
[44:18.350 --> 44:19.350]  and Kevin on his own.
[44:20.350 --> 44:21.350]  I'm still recording.
[44:22.350 --> 44:23.350]  I'm good.
[44:24.350 --> 44:26.350]  That grapefruit dab ain't nothing to fuck with.
[44:29.350 --> 44:30.350]  Shout out to that lovely young lady
[44:31.350 --> 44:32.350]  that gave it to me.
[44:33.350 --> 44:34.350]  That was fire.
[44:36.350 --> 44:37.350]  That was delicious.
[44:38.350 --> 44:39.350]  Savor my last grapefruit dab
[44:40.350 --> 44:41.350]  on the show with you guys.
[44:42.350 --> 44:43.350]  Oh, tastiness.
[44:44.350 --> 44:45.350]  My mouth is liking that.
[44:47.350 --> 44:49.350]  Well, let's give thanks to somebody, dude.
[44:50.350 --> 44:52.350]  How would you describe the flavor of that on your tongue?
[44:53.350 --> 44:54.350]  It's like orangey.
[44:55.350 --> 44:56.350]  Like a sweet...
[44:57.350 --> 44:59.350]  It's like a jolly rancher's came in orange?
[45:00.350 --> 45:01.350]  That's what it would be like, huh?
[45:02.350 --> 45:03.350]  Kind of like that.
[45:04.350 --> 45:05.350]  Don't you guys like Kevin's descriptions?
[45:06.350 --> 45:07.350]  Kind of like that.
[45:08.350 --> 45:09.350]  Kind of like that.
[45:10.350 --> 45:11.350]  Okay, I'm done coughing.
[45:13.350 --> 45:15.350]  Every episode we try to do a review
[45:16.350 --> 45:18.350]  we try to do a part of the show called Give Thanks.
[45:19.350 --> 45:20.350]  I'm going to apologize in advance
[45:21.350 --> 45:22.350]  because the two of us may tear up a little bit for this.
[45:23.350 --> 45:24.350]  Yeah.
[45:25.350 --> 45:26.350]  This is the most special episode
[45:27.350 --> 45:28.350]  or version of Give Thanks we've ever done.
[45:29.350 --> 45:30.350]  We want to give thanks to a young lady
[45:31.350 --> 45:32.350]  by the name of Jenny Kush.
[45:33.350 --> 45:34.350]  I've been looking for the right words to say about Jenny Kush
[45:35.350 --> 45:37.350]  and I honestly did not know Jenny a whole bunch.
[45:39.350 --> 45:41.350]  But I do see the effect that she had on my community,
[45:42.350 --> 45:43.350]  our community.
[45:44.350 --> 45:45.350]  And I feel that she deserves to be awarded.
[45:46.350 --> 45:47.350]  And honored.
[45:48.350 --> 45:49.350]  And so I was at the Cannabis Cup.
[45:50.350 --> 45:51.350]  I know, Cannabis Cup, blah, blah, blah.
[45:52.350 --> 45:53.350]  But I saw a magazine with Miss Jenny printed on the cover.
[45:54.350 --> 45:56.350]  And the magazine is CM Report.
[45:57.350 --> 45:58.350]  And it's October 13th.
[45:59.350 --> 46:01.350]  It's volume one, issue three.
[46:02.350 --> 46:03.350]  It's a free magazine.
[46:04.350 --> 46:05.350]  It's got a beautiful painting of Jenny on the cover.
[46:06.350 --> 46:07.350]  It's got red, gold, and green hair
[46:08.350 --> 46:09.350]  with purple in the background.
[46:10.350 --> 46:11.350]  And the author of this,
[46:12.350 --> 46:13.350]  and him and I kind of were in the same boat
[46:14.350 --> 46:15.350]  with our level of how much we knew Jenny.
[46:16.350 --> 46:17.350]  And I'm gonna read another person's article
[46:18.350 --> 46:19.350]  because it's perfect.
[46:20.350 --> 46:21.350]  Here we go.
[46:22.350 --> 46:23.350]  Jennifer Allette Munson,
[46:24.350 --> 46:25.350]  more commonly known as Jenny Kush
[46:26.350 --> 46:27.350]  and often self-referred to as Jenny fucking Kush.
[46:28.350 --> 46:29.350]  It's so awesome.
[46:30.350 --> 46:31.350]  Hi, I'm Jenny fucking Kush.
[46:32.350 --> 46:33.350]  But anyway, Jenny fucking Kush,
[46:34.350 --> 46:35.350]  a mother, an activist, an animal maker,
[46:36.350 --> 46:37.350]  a friend, and a lover of many things,
[46:38.350 --> 46:39.350]  ironically taken from us
[46:40.350 --> 46:41.350]  by the very thing she fought so hard against.
[46:42.350 --> 46:43.350]  I wanna make sure I'm recording this
[46:44.350 --> 46:45.350]  because we've had issues with the computer.
[46:46.350 --> 46:47.350]  But anyway, during a concert,
[46:48.350 --> 46:49.350]  Jenny and her life partner Jeremy
[46:50.350 --> 46:51.350]  were struck head on by a drunk driver
[46:52.350 --> 46:53.350]  traveling the wrong way on the high occupancy vehicle lane
[46:54.350 --> 46:55.350]  early in the morning of August 31st.
[46:56.350 --> 46:57.350]  Jenny hosted Sexpot Radio
[46:58.350 --> 46:59.350]  where they would discuss some of our favorite things,
[47:00.350 --> 47:01.350]  sex, pot, and all around mental,
[47:02.350 --> 47:03.350]  physical, and spiritual well-being.
[47:04.350 --> 47:05.350]  Jenny often attended local rallies and protests.
[47:06.350 --> 47:07.350]  And with her background in nursing,
[47:08.350 --> 47:09.350]  Jenny was always ready to help someone in need.
[47:10.350 --> 47:11.350]  And this is my article,
[47:13.680 --> 47:14.680]  but we're in the same boat here.
[47:15.680 --> 47:16.680]  So it says,
[47:17.680 --> 47:18.680]  I've only had the pleasure of interacting
[47:19.680 --> 47:20.680]  with Jenny on a few occasions,
[47:21.680 --> 47:22.680]  so I feel somewhat underqualified
[47:23.680 --> 47:24.680]  to write this article.
[47:25.680 --> 47:26.680]  Although my personal experience with Jenny was limited,
[47:27.680 --> 47:28.680]  my experience with those her life touched is plentiful.
[47:29.680 --> 47:30.680]  I gotta go slowly because if I go too fast,
[47:31.680 --> 47:32.680]  I'll tear up.
[47:33.680 --> 47:34.680]  I'm all high and you're making me read this.
[47:35.680 --> 47:36.680]  All right, this woman brought a community together
[47:37.680 --> 47:38.680]  in a way I have never before witnessed.
[47:39.680 --> 47:40.680]  Within hours of hearing the horrible news,
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.680]  her friends quickly organized donation pages
[47:43.680 --> 47:44.680]  to collect money for Jenny's four surviving children,
[47:45.680 --> 47:46.680]  Shelby, Christopher, Jordan, and me.
[47:47.680 --> 47:48.680]  And Tyler.
[47:49.680 --> 47:50.680]  A memorial party was organized
[47:51.680 --> 47:52.680]  at the Hood Lab on Larimer.
[47:53.680 --> 47:54.680]  And in the first 48 hours,
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.680]  the fundraiser site had collected $7,381.
[47:57.680 --> 47:58.680]  Yeah.
[47:59.680 --> 48:00.680]  I was at that party and donated fairly heavily.
[48:01.680 --> 48:02.680]  I was proud to be at both.
[48:03.680 --> 48:04.680]  And I'll add that to the $5,700
[48:05.680 --> 48:06.680]  collected at the Hood Lab
[48:07.680 --> 48:08.680]  and another $3,000
[48:09.680 --> 48:10.680]  from Moms of Marijuana donation page
[48:11.680 --> 48:12.680]  put the total over $15,000
[48:13.680 --> 48:14.680]  in less than two days.
[48:14.680 --> 48:15.680]  That was our community that did that.
[48:16.680 --> 48:17.680]  Well, I can't say our community,
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.680]  but that was mostly the cannabis community.
[48:20.680 --> 48:21.680]  So that shows that we're not a bunch of weed heads
[48:22.680 --> 48:23.680]  that we unite for a cause.
[48:24.680 --> 48:25.680]  And when we love somebody, man, we can show.
[48:26.680 --> 48:27.680]  So this was the response from Jenny's mother, Lori,
[48:28.680 --> 48:29.680]  on the donation site from Lori Monson.
[48:30.680 --> 48:31.680]  I don't know any of you, but Jenny was our daughter.
[48:32.680 --> 48:33.680]  Some of the names sound familiar.
[48:34.680 --> 48:35.680]  Jenny was always talking about her friends from Colorado.
[48:36.680 --> 48:38.680]  I just want to tell all of you how much it means to me
[48:39.680 --> 48:40.680]  and the rest of my family
[48:41.680 --> 48:42.680]  that we're all in this together.
[48:42.680 --> 48:43.680]  I just want to tell all of you how much it means to me
[48:44.680 --> 48:45.680]  and the rest of my family
[48:46.680 --> 48:47.680]  what you're doing for our daughter's children.
[48:48.680 --> 48:49.680]  Many blessings and thanks go out to each and every one of you.
[48:50.680 --> 48:51.680]  That's the part that makes me cry a little bit.
[48:52.680 --> 48:53.680]  Yeah.
[48:54.680 --> 48:55.680]  That was someone's daughter.
[48:56.680 --> 48:57.680]  That's rough.
[48:58.680 --> 48:59.680]  It's our friend, but I'm going to turn the read on.
[49:00.680 --> 49:01.680]  The Hood Lab was packed.
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.680]  Sorry, that was loud.
[49:04.680 --> 49:05.680]  The Hood Lab was packed.
[49:06.680 --> 49:07.680]  I'm passionate right now.
[49:08.680 --> 49:09.680]  Trying to keep it together for you, bro.
[49:10.680 --> 49:11.680]  The Hood Lab was packed
[49:12.680 --> 49:13.680]  and we were able to get in
[49:14.680 --> 49:15.680]  and do the opening.
[49:16.680 --> 49:17.680]  We were able to get in
[49:18.680 --> 49:19.680]  and do the opening
[49:20.680 --> 49:21.680]  and make donations.
[49:22.680 --> 49:23.680]  This was most definitely the largest crowd,
[49:24.680 --> 49:25.680]  250 plus people in attendance.
[49:26.680 --> 49:27.680]  The largest crowd the venue had seen
[49:28.680 --> 49:29.680]  since it opened in 2012.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.680]  The reason, a celebration.
[49:32.680 --> 49:33.680]  This is so well written right here.
[49:34.680 --> 49:35.680]  Hold on.
[49:36.680 --> 49:37.680]  Tears are for pussies.
[49:38.680 --> 49:39.680]  That's a Jenny Kush quote.
[49:40.680 --> 49:41.680]  All right.
[49:42.680 --> 49:43.680]  Unicorns, rainbows, and tutus.
[49:44.680 --> 49:45.680]  Dude, we saw big 300 pound dudes
[49:46.680 --> 49:47.680]  in tutus and shit with rainbow socks,
[49:48.680 --> 49:49.680]  bows in their hair.
[49:50.680 --> 49:51.680]  It was glorious.
[49:52.680 --> 49:53.680]  All right, that makes me smile.
[49:54.680 --> 49:55.680]  Purple hair, awkwardly long hugs.
[49:56.680 --> 49:57.680]  Our industry is known for awkwardly long hugs.
[49:58.680 --> 49:59.680]  It's like a fucking fish concert.
[50:00.680 --> 50:01.680]  All right, laughing and of course there were tears.
[50:02.680 --> 50:03.680]  I'm crying right now and I'll admit it.
[50:04.680 --> 50:05.680]  I miss this girl and I don't even know her.
[50:06.680 --> 50:07.680]  All right.
[50:08.680 --> 50:09.680]  It was overwhelming to say the least.
[50:10.680 --> 50:11.680]  I watched strangers hug,
[50:12.680 --> 50:13.680]  and in the eyes of Jenny's good deeds,
[50:14.680 --> 50:15.680]  fantastic edibles, acts of peace,
[50:16.680 --> 50:17.680]  and her unique laugh were told.
[50:18.680 --> 50:19.680]  It was only fitting that following
[50:20.680 --> 50:21.680]  the thunderstorm the next day,
[50:22.680 --> 50:23.680]  Jenny blessed us with an extremely vivid rainbow
[50:24.680 --> 50:25.680]  across the entire Denver sky.
[50:26.680 --> 50:27.680]  It was everything Jenny loved
[50:28.680 --> 50:29.680]  and exactly how she would have wanted it to be,
[50:30.680 --> 50:31.680]  minus the tears, because tears are for pussies.
[50:36.680 --> 50:37.680]  So.
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.680]  She was awesome, dude.
[50:40.680 --> 50:41.680]  I didn't get a chance to meet her very much.
[50:42.680 --> 50:43.680]  I knew so much about her for a long time.
[50:44.680 --> 50:45.680]  Just being in the room with her.
[50:46.680 --> 50:47.680]  Being in the room with her at the secret cup,
[50:48.680 --> 50:49.680]  you could just feel she was,
[50:50.680 --> 50:51.680]  she was everybody there, she was their mama.
[50:52.680 --> 50:53.680]  She gave everybody like, yeah, yeah.
[50:54.680 --> 50:55.680]  And that was the first time
[50:56.680 --> 50:57.680]  and only time I got to meet her,
[50:58.680 --> 50:59.680]  but I had a little conversation
[51:00.680 --> 51:01.680]  when I met both Jeremy and her at the,
[51:02.680 --> 51:03.680]  it was a 710 cup.
[51:06.680 --> 51:08.680]  And it was when Jeremy was doing the panel
[51:09.680 --> 51:10.680]  and I was doing the panel,
[51:10.680 --> 51:11.680]  the top shelf panel.
[51:12.680 --> 51:13.680]  After that, I introduced myself to Jeremy
[51:14.680 --> 51:15.680]  and introduced him to Jenny
[51:16.680 --> 51:17.680]  and they both knew about my hash cup
[51:18.680 --> 51:19.680]  and were following me on Instagram and stuff.
[51:22.680 --> 51:23.680]  They were like my heroes
[51:24.680 --> 51:25.680]  and I had only heard about them,
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.680]  I had never met them before.
[51:28.680 --> 51:29.680]  They were just, they acted like I was just,
[51:30.680 --> 51:31.680]  you know, their best friend.
[51:32.680 --> 51:33.680]  And I was like,
[51:34.680 --> 51:35.680]  I'm gonna go talk to them.
[51:36.680 --> 51:37.680]  And I was like,
[51:38.680 --> 51:39.680]  I'm gonna go talk to them.
[51:40.680 --> 51:41.680]  And I was like,
[51:42.680 --> 51:43.680]  I've been their best friend in the whole world
[51:44.680 --> 51:45.680]  for the last 20 years.
[51:46.680 --> 51:47.680]  That's how they treated me.
[51:48.680 --> 51:49.680]  And that's how she seemed to treat everybody.
[51:50.680 --> 51:51.680]  She gave me a huge hug
[51:52.680 --> 51:53.680]  and just acted like she had known me forever.
[51:54.680 --> 51:55.680]  And I was the best thing in the world
[51:56.680 --> 51:57.680]  and that was for, you know,
[51:58.680 --> 51:59.680]  a good five minutes.
[52:00.680 --> 52:01.680]  But it was, I'll never forget it.
[52:02.680 --> 52:03.680]  Nobody has ever treated me like that
[52:04.680 --> 52:05.680]  the moment they met me.
[52:06.680 --> 52:07.680]  Never.
[52:08.680 --> 52:09.680]  And it was,
[52:10.680 --> 52:11.680]  it was a huge thing.
[52:12.680 --> 52:13.680]  And what we can do
[52:14.680 --> 52:15.680]  as a person if we want to.
[52:16.680 --> 52:17.680]  Just takes a second.
[52:18.680 --> 52:19.680]  Just a second to say what's up to somebody.
[52:20.680 --> 52:21.680]  Yep.
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.680]  So we want to give super big thanks to Jenny Kush.
[52:24.680 --> 52:25.680]  Yeah.
[52:25.680 --> 52:26.680]  We love you Jenny.
[52:27.680 --> 52:28.680]  So also,
[52:29.680 --> 52:30.680]  Jenny had four children
[52:31.680 --> 52:32.680]  and what any community should do
[52:33.680 --> 52:34.680]  is help take care of some kids.
[52:35.680 --> 52:36.680]  Yeah.
[52:36.680 --> 52:37.680]  You can go to a website,
[52:38.680 --> 52:39.680]  it's called Fundraiser.
[52:40.680 --> 52:41.680]  Go to iGrowCulturePodcast
[52:42.680 --> 52:43.680]  and there will be a link.
[52:44.680 --> 52:45.680]  Click on that link and I promise it's a real website.
[52:46.680 --> 52:47.680]  I promise you're actually donating money
[52:48.680 --> 52:49.680]  for Jenny's children.
[52:50.680 --> 52:51.680]  There's a beautiful picture of Jenny.
[52:52.680 --> 52:53.680]  She's wearing a hemp necklace
[52:54.680 --> 52:55.680]  and I don't know, I'm not a,
[52:56.680 --> 52:57.680]  I'm straight so I don't know what to call this top she's wearing.
[52:58.680 --> 52:59.680]  She's got her arm up on her head.
[53:00.680 --> 53:01.680]  That's a real website.
[53:02.680 --> 53:03.680]  Go contribute.
[53:03.680 --> 53:04.680]  Right now there are $21,900 raised.
[53:05.680 --> 53:06.680]  Nice.
[53:07.680 --> 53:08.680]  That's a lot of money.
[53:08.680 --> 53:09.680]  What I can do,
[53:10.680 --> 53:11.680]  I grabbed a couple of pins
[53:12.680 --> 53:13.680]  from the Rare Dageness Jenny Kush booth
[53:14.680 --> 53:15.680]  at the Cannabis Cup.
[53:15.680 --> 53:16.680]  I've got three pins.
[53:17.680 --> 53:18.680]  One is a SexPod radio pin.
[53:19.680 --> 53:20.680]  One is an iDab pin
[53:21.680 --> 53:22.680]  and the other one is the Zombie Unicorn pin
[53:23.680 --> 53:24.680]  which is kind of rare and limited.
[53:25.680 --> 53:26.680]  I bought those
[53:27.680 --> 53:28.680]  and I want to make those a prize.
[53:29.680 --> 53:30.680]  The first person
[53:31.680 --> 53:32.680]  that contributes $100
[53:33.680 --> 53:34.680]  to Jenny's fund on Fundraiser
[53:35.680 --> 53:36.680]  and sends me some sort of a picture
[53:36.680 --> 53:37.680]  or a screenshot on Twitter
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.680]  at iGrowCulture,
[53:40.680 --> 53:41.680]  I'll send you these three pins as a thank you.
[53:42.680 --> 53:43.680]  That's the least I could do.
[53:44.680 --> 53:45.680]  So,
[53:46.680 --> 53:47.680]  go to this website, I'll tweet it.
[53:48.680 --> 53:49.680]  You donate $100
[53:50.680 --> 53:51.680]  and I will send you these pins.
[53:52.680 --> 53:53.680]  That's all it takes.
[53:54.680 --> 53:55.680]  Yeah, just take like a snapshot or something
[53:56.680 --> 53:57.680]  and message me.
[53:57.680 --> 53:58.680]  Actually, if you go throw down money
[53:59.680 --> 54:00.680]  on this site,
[54:01.680 --> 54:02.680]  it looks like you can Facebook or something
[54:03.680 --> 54:04.680]  and it shows people who have given money
[54:04.680 --> 54:05.680]  and it shows Mitch Geis gave $100.
[54:06.680 --> 54:07.680]  Bobby Black from High Times gave $200.
[54:08.680 --> 54:09.680]  He says,
[54:10.680 --> 54:11.680]  this donation is on behalf of myself
[54:12.680 --> 54:13.680]  and my wife April
[54:14.680 --> 54:15.680]  as well as a gentleman named Eric Carl
[54:16.680 --> 54:17.680]  who was the winning bidder in the auction
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.680]  for my porn collection.
[54:20.680 --> 54:21.680]  So, Bobby got married a little while ago
[54:22.680 --> 54:23.680]  and he auctioned off his porn collection
[54:24.680 --> 54:25.680]  and all the proceeds went to Jenny Kush.
[54:26.680 --> 54:27.680]  Nice.
[54:28.680 --> 54:29.680]  So, it shows Joel Halen gave,
[54:30.680 --> 54:31.680]  dude,
[54:32.680 --> 54:33.680]  big fucking love Joel Halen.
[54:34.680 --> 54:35.680]  I can't even say how much he gave.
[54:36.680 --> 54:37.680]  There are three posts in a row
[54:38.680 --> 54:39.680]  that are my rent.
[54:40.680 --> 54:41.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.680]  Shout out Joel Halen.
[54:44.680 --> 54:45.680]  Yeah.
[54:46.680 --> 54:47.680]  So, I can see it if you post here I think
[54:48.680 --> 54:49.680]  but if you just want to take a screenshot
[54:50.680 --> 54:51.680]  with your phone and tweet it to me,
[54:52.680 --> 54:53.680]  I'll send you these three pins.
[54:54.680 --> 54:55.680]  I would be proud of you.
[54:56.680 --> 54:57.680]  It'd be great.
[54:58.680 --> 54:59.680]  I feel like we can all work together that way.
[55:00.680 --> 55:01.680]  So, we're going to get our shit together
[55:02.680 --> 55:03.680]  and quit crying.
[55:04.680 --> 55:05.680]  I guess to wrap up that story,
[55:06.680 --> 55:07.680]  the person that killed Jenny Kush
[55:08.680 --> 55:09.680]  has pleaded guilty
[55:10.680 --> 55:11.680]  to manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter.
[55:12.680 --> 55:13.680]  That's what I think the charge is.
[55:14.680 --> 55:15.680]  There were no pleas offered.
[55:16.680 --> 55:17.680]  So, she just stepped up
[55:18.680 --> 55:19.680]  and pled guilty to what the hell she did.
[55:20.680 --> 55:21.680]  Not many people do that.
[55:22.680 --> 55:24.680]  She faces 36 years in prison.
[55:25.680 --> 55:26.680]  36 years.
[55:27.680 --> 55:28.680]  I wish her the best.
[55:29.680 --> 55:30.680]  I don't want to give my opinion really
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.680]  because that's fucked up.
[55:32.680 --> 55:33.680]  Yeah, she killed somebody.
[55:34.680 --> 55:35.680]  She killed a friend of mine.
[55:36.680 --> 55:37.680]  She's going to live with that inside forever
[55:38.680 --> 55:39.680]  and I hope she can learn and grow
[55:40.680 --> 55:41.680]  and I hope she can recover.
[55:42.680 --> 55:43.680]  All I can really say is
[55:44.680 --> 55:46.680]  ride on for just pleading guilty
[55:47.680 --> 55:48.680]  and not making them go through
[55:49.680 --> 55:50.680]  another year of court
[55:51.680 --> 55:52.680]  and just keep dragging it on.
[55:53.680 --> 55:54.680]  Just get it done.
[55:55.680 --> 55:56.680]  Get your shit started
[55:57.680 --> 55:58.680]  and get it done.
[55:59.680 --> 56:00.680]  Now, way to the prosecutor
[56:00.680 --> 56:01.680]  for not budging on doing deals
[56:02.680 --> 56:03.680]  and shit like that.
[56:04.680 --> 56:06.680]  You don't see that too, too often.
[56:07.680 --> 56:08.680]  Very true.
[56:09.680 --> 56:10.680]  Very true.
[56:11.680 --> 56:12.680]  Well, I think they may have caught on
[56:13.680 --> 56:14.680]  to who the lady was that they killed.
[56:15.680 --> 56:16.680]  Yeah.
[56:17.680 --> 56:18.680]  They killed a celebrity.
[56:19.680 --> 56:20.680]  With the way cannabis is going around here
[56:21.680 --> 56:22.680]  with the support from the community
[56:23.680 --> 56:24.680]  that we've got, they killed a celebrity.
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.680]  Everything she did all the way
[56:27.680 --> 56:28.680]  leading up to legalization
[56:28.680 --> 56:30.680]  and everything, she was a champion.
[56:31.680 --> 56:33.680]  All right, guys.
[56:34.680 --> 56:35.680]  We're on a billion person right there.
[56:36.680 --> 56:37.680]  So I don't want to harp on it,
[56:38.680 --> 56:39.680]  but as a community what we need to do,
[56:40.680 --> 56:41.680]  we all, excuse me,
[56:42.680 --> 56:43.680]  I'm not requiring a $100 donation,
[56:44.680 --> 56:45.680]  but that's what I'm going to do
[56:46.680 --> 56:47.680]  to send you a pin.
[56:48.680 --> 56:49.680]  If you guys can throw down $10, $20,
[56:50.680 --> 56:51.680]  these are four little kids
[56:52.680 --> 56:53.680]  that don't have a mama that need some care.
[56:54.680 --> 56:55.680]  I mean, they have family to help out,
[56:56.680 --> 56:57.680]  but who expected mama to disappear?
[56:58.680 --> 56:59.680]  If I disappeared, I hope somebody
[57:00.680 --> 57:01.680]  would throw down $10, $20 to help my daughter
[57:02.680 --> 57:03.680]  out with some food.
[57:04.680 --> 57:05.680]  If everyone threw in 50 cents,
[57:06.680 --> 57:07.680]  if every single person threw in 50 cents,
[57:08.680 --> 57:09.680]  it would be $500 million.
[57:10.680 --> 57:11.680]  Did you just make those numbers up?
[57:12.680 --> 57:13.680]  No, I'm not an adult.
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.680]  I just figure about the average adult.
[57:16.680 --> 57:18.680]  You look fucking confident.
[57:19.680 --> 57:20.680]  There's like three and a half billion people.
[57:21.680 --> 57:22.680]  Good job, bro.
[57:23.680 --> 57:24.680]  We were a little somber after the Jenny Kush.
[57:25.680 --> 57:26.680]  Jenny Kush, we love you.
[57:26.680 --> 57:27.680]  This is emotional.
[57:28.680 --> 57:29.680]  On our next episode,
[57:30.680 --> 57:31.680]  we're going to answer Twitter questions.
[57:32.680 --> 57:33.680]  If you've got questions,
[57:34.680 --> 57:35.680]  send them to us at agroculture.
[57:36.680 --> 57:37.680]  Weed related stuff,
[57:38.680 --> 57:39.680]  if you want to know about growing,
[57:40.680 --> 57:41.680]  if you want to know about laws,
[57:42.680 --> 57:43.680]  if you want to know what's up in Colorado.
[57:44.680 --> 57:45.680]  If you've got questions,
[57:46.680 --> 57:47.680]  feel free to ask them.
[57:48.680 --> 57:49.680]  I'll read them.
[57:50.680 --> 57:51.680]  I like interacting with the people
[57:52.680 --> 57:53.680]  that are listening.
[57:54.680 --> 57:55.680]  That's part of what I'm here for.
[57:56.680 --> 57:57.680]  He's a comedian.
[57:58.680 --> 58:00.680]  We'll see about that when he's on the show.
[58:01.680 --> 58:02.680]  He has a lot of questions about growing cannabis.
[58:03.680 --> 58:05.680]  He says that we talk over people's heads sometimes.
[58:06.680 --> 58:07.680]  He said he has no idea what we're saying
[58:08.680 --> 58:09.680]  a lot of the time.
[58:10.680 --> 58:11.680]  He's going to ask us a bunch of beginner questions.
[58:12.680 --> 58:13.680]  We're going to help our listeners.
[58:14.680 --> 58:15.680]  I'm not going to say his name yet.
[58:16.680 --> 58:17.680]  I'm not going to say his name yet.
[58:18.680 --> 58:19.680]  I don't know which name.
[58:20.680 --> 58:21.680]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name
[58:22.680 --> 58:23.680]  or if he's got a moniker he will use.
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.680]  You know him.
[58:26.680 --> 58:27.680]  He's a comedian.
[58:28.680 --> 58:29.680]  We've seen him naked in his comedy act.
[58:30.680 --> 58:31.680]  I have not seen that,
[58:32.680 --> 58:33.680]  but I have heard a lot about it.
[58:34.680 --> 58:35.680]  I'm not too sure.
[58:36.680 --> 58:37.680]  I think I just blew his whole bit too.
[58:38.680 --> 58:39.680]  I'm not too sure about that.
[58:40.680 --> 58:41.680]  Also, I plan to start doing the Grow School.
[58:42.680 --> 58:43.680]  I want to get comfortable with the microphone.
[58:44.680 --> 58:45.680]  I want to get comfortable with the show.
[58:46.680 --> 58:47.680]  I want to figure out the computer.
[58:48.680 --> 58:49.680]  Today it took a dump on us
[58:50.680 --> 58:51.680]  while we were recording the first round of this episode.
[58:52.680 --> 58:53.680]  I want to get that figured out.
[58:54.680 --> 58:55.680]  Then we're going to do Grow School.
[58:56.680 --> 58:57.680]  That's all the way up to Drying and Curing.
[58:58.680 --> 58:59.680]  We're going to talk about a lot of stuff in that.
[59:02.680 --> 59:03.680]  You got anything else to say, KevBro?
[59:05.680 --> 59:06.680]  Not really, man.
[59:07.680 --> 59:08.680]  That about sums up the Cannabis Cup episode, I think.
[59:09.680 --> 59:10.680]  Yeah, it does.
[59:11.680 --> 59:12.680]  We ended it well with Jenny Kush.
[59:13.680 --> 59:14.680]  We gave good shoutouts to everyone.
[59:15.680 --> 59:16.680]  We got Jenny Kush thanked.
[59:20.680 --> 59:21.680]  That's good for this one.
[59:22.680 --> 59:23.680]  Alright.
[59:24.680 --> 59:25.680]  Check us out on Instagram.
[59:26.680 --> 59:27.680]  Check us out on Facebook.
[59:28.680 --> 59:29.680]  Check us out on Twitter.
[59:30.680 --> 59:31.680]  You can listen to the show on iTunes, Stitcher.
[59:32.680 --> 59:33.680]  In less than a week,
[59:34.680 --> 59:35.680]  the show will be available on a site called Swell.
[59:36.680 --> 59:37.680]  It's www.swell.am.
[59:38.680 --> 59:39.680]  They claim to be kind of like
[59:40.680 --> 59:41.680]  the Pandora of the podcast world.
[59:42.680 --> 59:43.680]  If you click like on a couple things,
[59:44.680 --> 59:45.680]  they'll try to find what you like.
[59:46.680 --> 59:47.680]  If you click, fucking hate this,
[59:48.680 --> 59:49.680]  they'll try to not play that stuff for you.
[59:50.680 --> 59:51.680]  That's their shtick.
[59:52.680 --> 59:53.680]  I've been in email contact with them
[59:54.680 --> 59:55.680]  for a couple of weeks now.
[59:56.680 --> 59:57.680]  I've been doing live chats with them
[59:58.680 --> 59:59.680]  over the past couple days.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]  They claim they'll have my feed up
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]  in less than a week.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]  Check that out.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680]  Let them know that you like the show.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]  Keep listening, keep listening.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680]  The opening song, I don't know if I ever said it,
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680]  that was First Place by Task Rock.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680]  The closer is going to be Blaze Up by Midnight.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.680]  I'm going to go ahead and find that.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680]  Hey, thanks for sticking around.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.680]  Thanks for listening to me cry
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680]  while we talked about Jenny Kush.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680]  You got to see my sensitive side.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]  I'm going to wrap it up.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.680]  Thank you.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]  This sounds weird.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.680]  Thanks for noticing.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.680]  This may sound weird,
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.680]  but it was fun going to dinner with you.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.680]  It does sound weird, but that was...
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680]  We've never gone and just sat down
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680]  at a snazzy restaurant and just grubbed down
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680]  and were bros at a restaurant like that.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.680]  Sure.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680]  Two dudes stinking like weed in a classy joint.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]  That was pretty fun with you, bro.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680]  That was pretty fun.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680]  We don't get to do that a lot.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]  It's midnight now.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680]  Take that, Dad.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:10.120]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.460]  I'm going to be Blaze Up by Midnight.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460]  I'm going to go ahead and find that.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.460]  Thanks for listening to me cry
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.460]  while we talked about Jenny Kush.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.460]  You got to see my sensitive side.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.460]  It's going to be Blaze Up by Midnight.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.460]  Take that, Dad.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.460]  Sure.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.460]  Take that, Dad.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.460]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.460]  Take that, Dad.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.460]  It's going to be Blaze Up by Midnight.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.460]  It's going to be Blaze Up by Midnight.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:44.610]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It's episode number eight of the iGrow Culture podcast.

[01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.930]  Oh, man. That's how you know you're recording is when Jeff starts hacking up a line. Yeah,
[01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.930]  you know, that's how the show gets started every time. All right, I'm gonna fade this out. We'll
[01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:28.660]  start talking. Awesome fade out. We come into Kevin with the torch. Say what's up, Kev. What's up.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.300]  You should have said what's up, Kev. That would have been a lot smoother. Yeah. All right, ladies
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:36.740]  and gentlemen, thanks for listening to that cool intro. We're hanging out here with, we got Jesse,
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:42.980]  and we got Spence. We got Kev. We got Clint. Yeah. Clint's got a great look on his face. Yeah.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.700]  Scared of these dabs. Scared it's gonna get in me. Oh, that's a good place to start. So we got
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:52.260]  our buddy Clint. He's a comedian. He's not a dabber. Have you ever smoked in your life?
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:05:00.100]  I've smoked and never done anything much. Much? No, just, you know, hitting the bowl back 10
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.180]  years ago. 10 years ago? Yeah. So weed has changed completely since back then. Yeah,
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:09.620]  that was East High School weed. Oh God, I'm sorry. Yeah. So I have no idea what weed is. All
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.220]  right. You'll be in for some lessons today. Yeah. Clint's going to get an education. He
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.540]  wants us to teach you guys some of the amateur stuff that we seem to have forgotten.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.260]  Music's too loud in my headphone. Sorry. Sorry. Also sitting over there on the table,
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.140]  we got our buddy Jesse. I almost said your last name, dude. I'm sorry. I won't do that.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:33.060]  Oh, it's all good. Cool. What's up, everyone? So Jesse and our buddy Spence were in a contest
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:38.180]  or a competition called the Pueblo Super Bud Bowl over the 420 weekend, and they both got some awards.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.380]  What kind of award did you win over there, Jesse? I took overall in private entry,
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:54.740]  overall crowd favorite for my grape OG. Nice. Congratulations. You got a really good review.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:59.060]  One of the people that hosted the contest said this was such a favorite of myself and the judges
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.340]  until there was none left to display a landslide winner in this category. Nice. Yeah. He said you
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:09.700]  drew that shit to perfection. Yeah. Is it your cross? Did you make the grape OG? I helped
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:16.340]  Paul and Chuck Paul and Chuck. I like that. I was provided the pollen and just hit it with a
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:26.180]  plan I had and I wasn't expecting what came out from it. It's really floral, really creepy.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:36.020]  Great stuff. No, it's really good. It has like it has pretty much everything. The bag appeal,
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:44.820]  it smokes great. It has pretty good benefits to it as well. So there's some positives behind it.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.780]  Do you know, would you tell us what the cross is or do you want to keep that a secret?
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:57.860]  Um, the, the mom is a, uh, reversed, uh, uh, Tahoe OG or no, I bet, uh, SFV OG. Okay. From
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:06.580]  Kelly connection, I believe. Um, the female or the, the, uh, um, the other female. Um,
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.660]  yeah, I'll just kind of keep that one quiet. Okay. Good enough. I know that that reversed a
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:17.540]  female that uses male. I know that's good shit. So yeah, right on a Clint's lost over here. He's
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:24.820]  lost. Yeah. What's happening. So he made a screen. He took a female plant and used, I'm not even
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.700]  going to ask about the method because I'm a breeder too. I don't know. We don't talk about
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.700]  how we do our reversing and such. That's kind of our own. Uh, but you take a female plant and you
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:37.540]  reverse it, make it into a male, uh, by certain techniques. And then it'll spit out pollen that
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.740]  only has female traits. And so you'll make female seeds out of that. That was one of the questions
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.380]  I had. Nice. We'll, we'll, we'll elaborate on that a little more if you want to. Nice. So a lot
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:52.580]  of the grape. Oh, gee, what's it taste like? Did you bring me any? Yeah. Yeah. Nice. I'm popping
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:58.660]  open a jar here. That's the little shaky bit. They were able to return to me. You got some back.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:03.540]  I'm amazed at the end of it. It's dense as shit. It's bright green. It's got nice orange to it.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:10.100]  I'm going to smell it. I don't know why it's called grape. I approve it. Nicely grown. Thank
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.340]  you. I didn't attend the, uh, super bud bowl. I was up at the cannabis. Next time I'll have to
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:18.100]  grow something and have one of you guys rep it for me or something. I didn't realize we could do
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.740]  that. I actually saw, um, I can't remember the gentleman's name, but I saw a really great, uh,
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:30.100]  heart of gold sample there. Wow. He, uh, said he was also growing your, um, grateful dog too.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:38.340]  I wish we knew who that was. Yeah, man. Was it any good? Yeah. Oh yeah. It was, uh, one of the
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.740]  more golden goat Finos. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Heart of gold. Heart of gold leans a lot to the golden.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:49.060]  Yeah. This was one of the real heavy ones, but, um, it, uh, yeah, I, I smoked a joint with him.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.700]  It was great. So shout out to whoever did a good job with that. Hit me up on Twitter or email me
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.140]  something. Cause I'd like to see your work. I'd like to taste it. And, uh, maybe I'll give you
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.940]  some more beans. You can run some good stuff for me. Sure. Uh, Spence, would you win buddy? Um,
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:08.660]  Oh, I entered in the private side of hash. Um, and at the end, they ended up joining the medical
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:15.060]  and the private side together. So I took second, um, second place in best wax is what they called
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:20.340]  it. Um, did you enter shatter or wax? Um, I entered shatter. Okay. Um, do you have any of it?
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.580]  You have some of it. Do you, I have some of those, the talisman. Yeah. Good stuff. I've
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.940]  been dabbing that all weekend. It's definitely good. It's engaged product. So shout out to gauge
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:36.340]  age green, good family. Sure. I got to meet key play and MK four or M four K whichever one. Yeah.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:41.380]  Good cats. Really good cats. Good family. Keep going. Sorry. I totally interrupted. Um,
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:50.420]  I took second behind, uh, my job conveniently. So it was not too bad, but, um, it was, uh,
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:56.020]  talisman OG, or I don't even know if they're calling it an OG, but talisman. Um, and my mix
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:01.140]  was actually three different Finos of the talisman altogether. So I figured it'd give a
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:09.220]  better, you know, taste for what it was made of. Um, I dubbed it, uh, Kim trails, because it was
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:17.220]  made out of one of the parents of talisman is Kim dog OG. So it's very, very Kimmy. So that's why
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:22.260]  we named it the Kim trails. Sweet. So some, somebody hit me up and said, I like Kim, but I
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:26.660]  don't like Kim trails. And I was like, well, you'll you'll like it anyway. So it was cool.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:31.380]  Uh, rare dankness has a strain called Kim trails. So be careful. It's cool. It's just, it's all
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.660]  good. It's just hash. Yeah. I wonder about that. Sometimes I'm going to bust your balls a little
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.140]  bit and we're bro. So it's cool. Uh, when the hash makers make hash, sometimes it's confusing
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:44.260]  to patients, uh, when you label it as Kim trails, cause now they think it's Kim trails dabs. Yeah.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:49.060]  Or if you made up a name, I see, I know one guy on the online, on the damn internet that makes up
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.660]  names. Oh, we took off his headphones. We're going to fight. No, the headphones cut out. So,
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:56.180]  Oh man, I can tap them here. I'll tell him. It's all right, brother. But, uh, when people mix up
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.500]  the, uh, the flavors, it's confusing to the patient. So just to bust your balls a little,
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.380]  no worries. That's cool. That was for a competition. It wasn't for a dispensary or
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.900]  anything. We can get your headphones gone, bro. I'm just going to hit up Kevin next. So here I'll
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.620]  keep talking. How's it sound? Anything? See, so I just got to tap on it again. See, it's right here,
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.060]  right there. How's that? That feels good. Oh, you like that, but does it make the headphones work
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.380]  right there? Okay. Yeah. That's it. That's kind of gross. Yeah. You should have seen the look he
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:24.180]  gave me. It's kind of gross. How are you doing over there, Kev? You're quiet today, bro. I'm high.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:29.700]  I'm high. I'm dabbed up. Spence won two awards, bro. Nice. Proud of them. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:35.460]  Nice. Congratulations. We got to both of you guys. Thank you for sure. Uh, we, uh, promised the
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.340]  viewer or the listeners, the viewers, you can't even see us. We promised the listeners last time
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.180]  that we're going to talk about your, uh, hive nail. Oh yeah. You want to take some dabs off of
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.100]  that? Sure. All right. We're going to do a little bit of a review. Uh, we got to get, if you're using
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.500]  a hive nail, something I should tell you, don't use titanium tools. Don't use metal tools. Yeah.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:55.380]  Don't use a paper clip coated in plastic. Like one of our friends tried to do. If you're listening,
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:01.060]  bro, you've done a lot of smarter shit than that in your life. Let's not, uh, man. Yeah. Don't,
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:05.300]  don't use weird tools on the hive. Use some glass or some, they need to make a nice ceramic dabber.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:12.340]  They do have a dabber and carb cap, but they were sold out. No. Okay. So I did not buy one.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:17.780]  All right. Fair enough. So you're supposed to heat it in a circle, right? Yep. For how long?
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.380]  Do you have like a count? Do you know, do you have like a count in your head? I always know
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:26.660]  how long I have not counted. I have not took the time to count. It's about 15 to 20 seconds. If
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.900]  you haven't counted, how do you know that? How do I know what, how do you know that it's 15 to 20
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:38.820]  seconds? Estimating time. Okay. A lot of ball busting on this show. So heat in a circle.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:52.980]  Five, 10, 15. I think that's good. Yeah. Now feel it. Now feel it. Okay. Don't touch it though.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.740]  Don't just grab it. I think it needs a little more. I know how to tell when a nail is hot
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.340]  enough, but it needs a little more. All right. That's the kind of feel warm to your fingers,
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:04.900]  about an inch above 20 to 25 is where I think we need to go. You don't want it to be hot,
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:09.060]  but you don't want it to take a second to feel warm. Yeah. Like you should do one of you hash
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:13.700]  guys want to explain about a low temp dads and all the people overheating their dads. Either one of
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.780]  you guys, both of you together, Spence nodded at you, bro. Go for it. I'll chime in. No worries.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:23.140]  The low temp dabs like really help conserve the cannabinoids and the terpenes
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:29.540]  throughout the hash. When you do higher temp dabs, you end up boiling away and it destroys
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:36.180]  some of that molecular structure if it's too hot. But also you don't want to do them too cold either
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.460]  because sometimes, you know, you want to melt all the hash. Obviously you want to get everything
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:49.940]  consumed from the dab. And God forbid, if there is residuals, it does help burn off the residuals.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:54.180]  So you don't consume those. Yeah. Yeah. Pentane burns at 600 degrees. Yeah. You don't want it to
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:59.780]  be too cold. So that way I'm wrong with that. I don't remember. Yeah. 600, like six Oh five
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:05.140]  will burn off pentane and butane. Yeah. A lot of people don't understand it, but it's, you know,
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:09.940]  you don't want to be dabbing off of a scolding red nail. That's not very good for your body.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:16.020]  Yeah. I mean, obviously you can tell like when you're yakking up after a dab, it's most likely
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:20.980]  from your dabs or coming off a red hot nail or you take too big a dabs like I do. Or you do that.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.860]  I kind of do them too large. So I like that. That was nice and smooth. Honestly, it wasn't my first
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:30.900]  hit off there, but it's my first one on the show. It's smooth. It tastes good. I overheated it just
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.380]  a touch, but that tastes good. It's nice and smooth. What I liked is somebody told me that
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.900]  you could take several dabs off of it if you kind of overheat it the first time. Yeah. It holds
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:44.260]  temperature really well. If you're, should I even say this? If you're in the car and dabbing and all
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.220]  three of you in the car need to get a dab and you don't want to be with the torch in the car a lot,
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:53.540]  then you can pull two or three dabs. I'm not sure that if I just promoted dabbing in the car, but
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.780]  people do it. I saw a guy in Denver a couple of weeks ago, dabbing in the car and he scared the
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.140]  shit out of me. I thought he was going to drive into some shit. He didn't, he was not pro like us.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:06.980]  Oh, I thought you were talking about a parker. Yeah, he was moving. He was moving. Yeah. Dab in
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:11.380]  the car if you're parked. Okay. Don't dab in the car if you're driving. What if you're a passenger?
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:17.460]  Go for it. Fuck it. So if I'm driving, Kev should take dabs. No problem. He should take more dabs.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.020]  You should take one for me, right? Yeah, exactly. One for your homies. Double dabs. Blow it in your face.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:29.460]  What do you think of that nail, Jess? Uh, yeah, it's really smooth. Cool. Cool. Uh, it scares me though.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:35.220]  I've seen a couple of them that are, yeah, go ahead. You're gonna, um, I'm a big guy. Uh, fragile things scare me.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:42.420]  So me as well. Yeah. That's partly why I'm afraid of it. Uh, until we break it, I, I approve. That's a
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.420]  cool thing. And I'll try my best not to break your nail, bro. It's ceramic. And in my world,
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:51.140]  we're heating it and cooling it. It just makes sense to me that it's going to bust. I've seen one.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:56.900]  One of my friends has one at his house and they broke it pretty quickly. Now the nail is the,
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:02.260]  the piece that's, that's connected to the bond. Oh yeah. Clinton noob. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to ask
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.700]  the questions that some people aren't going to know. That's awesome. I like it. We need you here
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.860]  for more episodes just to chime in just like that. Exactly what we need you for. I believe that would
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:16.100]  be referred to as a rig. Sorry. The thing that looks like a bong called the rig. There is the,
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:22.100]  uh, the heated part. It's a baby bong. It's a, the heated, the part that you're heating up is
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:29.380]  called a nail from what I've gathered so far. Yes. It is either a ceramic or titanium or quartz
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:36.580]  or glass. If they're really cheap shit I've seen, I've seen Jeff dabbing off of titanium as well as
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:43.380]  now I've seen the, the ceramic. Um, now between those two, what do you guys prefer?
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:49.940]  Is there a preference in between those two or is it still new? There's a ceramic still new and you
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:54.100]  don't know yet. Um, I haven't spent enough time with the ceramic to see how long it'll last. The
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.060]  titanium does burn out from heating and cooling and absorbing all that Earl and all that. It does
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:05.860]  burn out. I haven't had the ceramic long enough. Haven't seen one around. I, I'm not a, the ceramic
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:10.740]  doesn't come in a domed version and in my backpack when I'm cruising, I need a dome because I get
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.820]  shit stuck to my domeless nail. And the next time I go to use it, it tastes like shit. It's funky.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:19.940]  So I need a domed one, like with the dome here. Oh, it's almost a cap that goes over your nail.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.580]  Right. And these are domeless. Uh, there's a hole right down the center of it. So you don't need
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.100]  the dome. So it's a little more convenient for here at the table, but in my backpack, I need
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.900]  this style. So he's like, Oh, sorry. Go for it, bro. Like that's how I just did. I didn't even
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:36.660]  heat it with the torch. It was still hot enough for me to do my dab. And it was like the perfect
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.820]  temperature. Actually. That's kind of a bro dab. That's kind of neat. Yeah. This actually also
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:46.820]  represents progression in nails to, uh, starting with the domed ones and then the domeless and now
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:51.700]  the ceramics. So the domed ones were the first ones. Yeah. Right. All right. Yeah. Actually,
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:56.820]  what was kind of first was the swing arm skillet. Yeah. They made a piece that came out of here and
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:01.060]  it hung upside down and they wrapped like a piece of wire around it and hung a little titanium plate
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:05.140]  underneath there. Okay. And you drop your dab on the plate and it would go when you inhale, it'd
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:11.460]  go up. And those things hit like a fricking rock. It was bad. It's like a bell over a little hot
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:16.100]  plate. So we're very happy that we moved away from that. Yes. Yes. Shout out to task for, uh,
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:22.500]  improving and innovating the nails every day. For sure. I had a question on the grape OZ or OG,
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:29.140]  sorry. Yeah. Great bounce. I'm an idiot. Um, on the grape OG, is that something that, um,
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:33.060]  that somebody can pick up? Is there a place they can pick that up or is that just your personal
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.300]  stuff? That's my personal stuff. Okay. And then on the shatter we were talking about earlier,
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.220]  um, I already forgot the name of it. Is that something that do they sell that kind of stuff
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.500]  in dispensaries and recreational places? Some places, some places. Is that something they can
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:53.780]  pick up? It just depends. Like it's a commodity. Like honestly, like we, like I work for a shop,
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:19:00.340]  so like the demand for it is so high that it's never around. I mean it is, but once it's there,
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:06.260]  it's gone. I guess I kind of half-assed trying to plug your stuff so people can buy it. But if
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:13.540]  it's your stuff, then, uh, then fuck them. Yeah. A lot of dads are hard to come by. We're, uh,
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.540]  those of us that are blessed enough to have a nice little slab like this, we kind of hoard it.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.940]  Yeah. I take my material from, well, I'm a seed maker. I'm a seed breeder and I have my
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.780]  own little caregiver girl and I take my leftover material, the trim and whatnot, and let these two
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:30.340]  guys blast it for me. And that's how they make a lot of their cut for their personal hash. I don't
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:35.060]  want to get into their business, but then I get my cut back and I barely get enough. I dab a lot
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:41.140]  and I've got patients that I have to distribute it to share it with, uh, medically. So it disappears
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.500]  very quickly. All right. Yes. Seeing everybody in the room nodded like, Oh, and I'm sitting there
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.740]  going, Oh, cause I've only hung out with you when somebody's dabbing. It's only been you.
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:54.580]  And I always see like, there's a good amount of, I guess, shatter. Is that what we're going to call
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:20:00.580]  it? Yeah. Wax. Um, whatever other names you guys have any wax? No. Okay. I'll show you some wax
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:04.820]  one day. Wax is the same. You take this product, if you're doing it right, you take this product
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.860]  and at the end you heat it again and apply like a whipping motion to it to put air into it. And it
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:14.340]  just fluffs it up a little bit. And the, some people skip a couple of steps and they do that
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:19.060]  too early. And that fucks everything up. If you do it right and do it at the end, wax can be great.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:22.340]  And what I like about it, this, we have to use a little dab tools. It's kind of shattery. It's
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.740]  hard to work with wax. You can pick it up and play with it and make a little ball and slam,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:30.260]  dunk it without a dabber. It's a little easier to work with and it hits harder.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:34.980]  Yeah. Some of the best tasting like hash I've ever smoked has been wax. Okay. Sure. Yeah. I'd
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:40.340]  agree with that. Some tangy wax. That's awesome. The guy down there at the end of the table
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:47.140]  actually has made the best tasting wax. I think it was something you grew. That was a couple of
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:52.180]  years ago. That was actually a while ago too. So it was probably the grateful dog or the,
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:58.580]  um, might've been one of the, I want to say it was the, uh, lemon skunk. It's always been one
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:03.140]  of my favorites. We used to do a lot of the lemon stuff. We'd make wax. Yeah. Cool. Thank you.
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:09.060]  No, I think that lemon Jeffrey is some of the best dads you can make. Yeah. That one's skittles.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.300]  A lot of people always ask what's your best for dabs. If you're making shatter, order up a pack
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:18.660]  of lemon Jeffrey, but guess what? I sold out for a minute. They're coming to, I'm working on it.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:23.380]  It takes a long time to breed some seeds. They see that you're sold out. I think you can refill
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.900]  it tomorrow. You're like, eh, or no takes a minute, bro. How long does it take to breed seeds?
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:35.780]  And what exactly is that? Oh, wow. Uh, so here comes like a hour and a half question.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.140]  The quick part is you got to get plants that you have to make selections. You have to have a male
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.620]  and know which females you want to breed with. You have to get them large enough to put into
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.620]  the flower stage, which will take you two or three months. Uh, the way that I like to grow
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.940]  usually about two months, three, if you're just from clone, uh, then you got to get those flowering.
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:01.380]  You have to, one needs a headstart on the other. I will not get specific into times. Uh, so you're
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.660]  looking about 12 weeks of flowering time after the two months. So you're looking like five or
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.980]  six months just to produce the seeds. And then you need to test them. Like if I were going to put
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.820]  them out, I would give them to all these guys to grow, to see what they do before I would even
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.900]  consider putting them out to anybody. Oh, of course. Yeah. Yeah. And then if I find that
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.340]  they're kind of fucked up, but they're close, I'll find one that's really close to what I'm
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:27.620]  looking for because there'll be variations. Uh, that's a whole nother, there'll be variations in
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.260]  phenotype. If like, if, uh, like your brothers and sisters all don't look the same. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.180]  I'd find the brother and sister that looks just perfect that I want to make babies with. And I'd
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:41.140]  keep that one and breed it back with the daddy again. Okay. And so that'll bring the traits that
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:47.540]  I want maybe, or, or sometimes that second cross sometimes when you fuck everything up, but if you
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.460]  do it right, if you find, if you've got that magic, it's all genetic combinations. If they match up,
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:56.900]  right. You'll come out with by the third or fourth generation, every seed will be very similar to each
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:02.100]  other by the time they're done. Okay. Yeah. So breeding could take, if you're making F ones from
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:07.540]  fans and you're cool with that, uh, five months, six months, if you're making F ones that are regs,
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:12.340]  uh, five or six months. But if you want to make F twos, which are going back and rebreeding or
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:18.900]  make F threes, you're looking at years and years. I have a strain. I've been back crossing, um,
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:25.220]  for four or five years now. So, and I'm only on the third leg of the back cross. So goodness.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:31.700]  Speaker 1 So there's, there's, there's a lot more to, you know, growing a weed than,
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:36.820]  than many people give you guys credit for, you know, because I look at it and I'm like, all right,
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.820]  well, there's plants in the ground or plants and pots and they're growing them and then you're
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.900]  going to harvest them. And I don't look at, you know, all the back work that goes into that.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:51.060]  And I know that like, like the last time I smoked weed was 10 years ago. And so of course,
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.300]  things are going to get better. But I, I did see that huge progression when, uh,
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.980]  when medicals started being okay.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:01.060]  Speaker 3 Oh yeah. That's, that really what is what helped us be able to breed. We could set up,
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:05.780]  not we, but they could set up thousand light warehouses and just throw out as many
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.860]  seeds as they could and grow all of them. And then you find that magic keeper. And then,
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:13.940]  yeah, if you've got, if you can grow in that many numbers, that's why Holland is big. Holland lets
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.060]  you kind of get away with a lot of plant numbers. You can shout out to Holland.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.420]  Speaker 2 The best comes from Northern California or came from Colorado.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:25.940]  Speaker 3 Yeah. Now it's from Colorado. Uh, Colorado breeders are killing it. Not even
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.940]  just because we're from here, but we have a lot of, we have a lot of advantages. We're, uh, the
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:34.340]  same altitude and climate and conditions as Afghanistan, which is where a lot of our favorite
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:39.780]  genetics are from. It's really advantageous. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. 300 days of sunlight a year.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:46.580]  Yeah. That's you don't get that in a lot of places besides like Iraq. I grew up in Iraq.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:53.460]  Yeah. So, um, the plants get huge here. Gigantic yields trunks this big around
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.620]  for the listener. That was like a 12 inch circumference. Yeah. That was easily one of
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:07.300]  those Gatorade bottles or yeah. It's like an arm to water bottles. I've seen, I've seen branches
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:12.580]  that grown men can actually stand on to like reach the top of their plant. Yeah. I've seen
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:18.100]  guys have to get ladders to trim the top. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. There's, I know spots where I've
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:23.860]  been on 350 plant outdoor farms where the four of us grown men sitting here, sorry, Kevin, I didn't
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.300]  mean to disclude you from the grown men, but it wouldn't take you also. It just needs us for
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.940]  the four of us could reach around these plants and barely touch hands, but the four of us would
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.260]  take to get around these plants. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. We're looking five pounds on some of those,
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.020]  not on Jesse's, but these are like in a mountain town where nobody will find them.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.580]  Five pounds out of one plant, five pounds out of one. And they're rocking,
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.660]  they're rocking probably 300 of them on some of these plantations. But that's, I mean,
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:50.020]  they're putting a lot of money into like the, like you were saying, there's a crew out there.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.860]  Yeah. There's, there's a crew like us work like us boys. There's a crew of us working there all
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.420]  day long from morning to night all day. And then at night they just hang out. It's like, can they
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:04.180]  pass out because it's hard manual labor. It is. People don't give us credit for, for being a,
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.340]  I've got an indoor facility and you've got trash to deal with. Like the city doesn't want your weed
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:12.020]  trash. You got to handle that. You got to get that to the dump and the dump doesn't want it either.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:17.540]  Need a fireplace. Yeah. But then that's a fire ordinance. You know, you don't want them coming
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.980]  to your grow facility. You're burning fucking all these pot. It smells, it stinks. It smells like
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:27.620]  dirt to deal with. You got water to deal with. There's a lot to think about. It's yeah. Electricity,
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:33.540]  the fire hazards, licensing. There's a lot to. Yeah. See. And that's something I think everybody
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:38.340]  got mad because like the dispensaries were, Oh, it's going to be so expensive. I can get it from
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:43.220]  this guy. And it's like, well, yeah, but look how professional they are being with these in
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:47.780]  these dispensaries. They have to go through such regulations. Right. And the weed there mostly is
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:52.100]  usually pretty clean. Usually I've seen some dirty shit. They're going through a lot of
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:56.260]  regulation now. So the weeds tested, uh, they're all going through steep Hill Halen labs or a
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:27:02.420]  similar laboratory. Uh, and they're getting all their stuff tested for molds, parasites, pesticides,
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.580]  uh, little bugs. So if there's spider mites or fungus gnats or white flies in your weed,
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:10.740]  they're going to find it. Uh, they're able to test. Addison said that they can test for,
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.340]  uh, things like flora, my, and as a max and as a, my, and your plants and Eagle 20
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:22.020]  in your buds. If you use that shit in the cloner. Yeah. So that makes sense.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.740]  Yeah. That's one of those is a, a minus side. One of them is actually a fungicide. And the other one
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:33.220]  is, uh, just like an all around bug treatment. But what that means is in the cloner is basically
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:36.500]  the start of life. You cut a plant and it's got a clone to make roots. And then you've got to
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:42.500]  vege it. Most people go three or four weeks. I go 30 to 45 days. I like them a little bigger.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.380]  And then you flower for usually nine weeks is average. So from these little tiny babies,
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:53.460]  all the way to they grow and you flower it, you dry it, you trim it out. Uh, this lab can find
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:57.060]  pesticides in there. They can be like, Oh yeah, use this shit. Here it is. We found it in there.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:03.540]  Also dry it out of these, like this kind of bud. These are like neurotoxins and proven carcinogenics
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:08.420]  and stuff. Yeah. No, you don't want to dab neuro because we're, most of us are dabbers.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:14.740]  They're meant for ornamental flowers that aren't going to be consumed. Okay. Yeah. But, uh,
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.980]  there's something that doesn't care. Yes. Yeah. Monsanto will spray that right on your car. But
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:26.020]  as medical caregivers, we don't, uh, like his pops is quite sick. He's got a condition that if we gave
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:30.820]  him some cannabis that had neurotoxins in it, it's only going to make him worse. We're trying
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:35.620]  to heal him, you know? So that's the kind of stuff that we all have to be aware of. And we have to be
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.020]  conscious of. And like, that's our goal. That's what separates the medical growers and the real
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:44.340]  growers from just the guys out there trying to make a buck. I'd rather cut down a moldy plant,
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:49.060]  throw it away, then sell it to one of my, most of my patients, honestly, are older cats. And I don't
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:53.300]  want to see them. I don't want to feel like I just killed them. I don't want that. I do this to feel
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:57.940]  better. It feels good to watch people. Uh, his old man came over one time, felt like shit. He
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:03.060]  walks with a cane, hunched over, walks with a cane, uh, smoked the perfect strain with him.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:06.820]  That dude stood up and walked up the stairs and turned around and said, Hey, will you bring me
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:10.980]  my cane? I forgot it. Nice. Yeah. That's the kind of shit that makes you feel like Jesse's smiling
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.180]  over there. Spence is not in his head. That's the kind of shit that makes you like, yeah,
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:18.820]  that's awesome. Like, oh yeah, that's, that's some weed that people hate. I grew that and it made
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.420]  this guy stand up and he forgot. I don't know if he forgot that he hurt or if the pain went away,
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.980]  it doesn't matter. The interaction, the smoke session and the cannabis healed him long enough
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:32.660]  for him to forget his cane and walk up some stairs. So that's, that's, that's awesome. I
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:36.340]  forgot where I was even going. I got some questions about that topic, but yeah, that's
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:42.100]  at the, uh, at the Bud Bowl this weekend, one of the judges that had a man, I'm, I'm stoned.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:48.180]  You're on the right show for that. Don't worry. One of the judges that smoked the grape OG
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.300]  was epileptic and she told me she didn't have any seizures for three days while she was smoking
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:30:00.260]  that. And I mean, that's awesome. She had already smoked pot and you know, had good results from it,
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:06.260]  but had still had the occasional seizure. But with the grape OG, she, I guess three days with that
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:12.180]  one. So now is that a, uh, like a THC content or a CBD content hasn't been tested. It's the
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:16.420]  perfect combination, whatever it is. I don't think it's one. I'm not a scientist, but as my experience
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:21.140]  with the plant and administering, uh, plants and strains to people, I think it's a combination of
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:26.740]  terpenoids and THC, CBD, uh, all of the different cannabinoids. I think it's a combination,
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:32.420]  perfectly matching her condition in her body profile. Uh, there may be another person sitting
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:37.460]  right next to her that has the same condition that it may not help, but I may have a plant in
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:42.980]  my arsenal that may be perfect for that person. Well, there's thousands of strains now. Yeah.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:48.580]  Millions because Jesse's a Paul and Chucker Spence is on his way to being a Paul and Chucker. I'm a
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:52.500]  Paul and Chucker. Uh, by the time Kev gets good at growing weed, he'll be a Paul and Chucker.
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.740]  Cause he's watching all of us. It only takes a little once. If you're reaching for quality,
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:01.060]  you want a Paul and Chuck. It's the way that the progression goes. Uh, I had to explain to
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:06.260]  a customer one time, like he, he actually was like, I don't see why there's all these different
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:10.260]  strains. They can't be different. And I had to explain to him, like, actually they are like,
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:16.820]  we found over 200 different molecules that are in different levels in every single plant. So
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:20.420]  we should get Addison to more on the phone one day. He can teach us about genome mapping.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:25.700]  I can't wait. Yeah. We'll get an episode. I'll call him and see what he knows. Maybe he can put
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.460]  us in touch with the right people. Shout out Addison to Morris steep hill labs. Yeah. Something
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.900]  else I'd just like to mention kind of on the subject, uh, CBD only legislation that is happening
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:42.980]  in States, uh, that like maybe just a strain named after a book. Uh, they only want to grow
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:49.060]  that. Well, that's bullshit. Cause, um, because of what we were just talking about. Yeah. It's
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:56.260]  the full profile, not just CBD. Uh, some conditions do require a higher level of certain things than,
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:02.100]  than other conditions. So you need to find the right one that has the right levels of the right
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:06.660]  molecules for you. You know, one thing that, uh, one thing that somebody discovered I did,
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:11.140]  this was not my discovery. Uh, I think it was Mitch and NASA that made this realization.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:15.220]  Plants that are high in CBD and low in THC qualify as hemp. And it's legal to grow hemp
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.740]  all the fuck over. So, uh, grow that shit, grow large fields of CBD plants. If that's your shtick.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:27.540]  Yeah. Yeah. And then make a RSO out of it. Uh, actually we're not supposed to call it RSO. Rick,
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.820]  I was referring to Rick Simpson oil, but we're not going to call it Rick Simpson oil anymore
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.980]  because there's some controversy with that. People claim that he stole the idea and there's
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:38.100]  a lot of weird stuff being said in the cannabis community. And I don't want any part of the
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:43.060]  backlash. So, uh, it's full cannabis plant extract. Essentially you take a whole plant
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:46.020]  and I don't know how to do it. I'm kind of ignorant to it. That's not my, I'm not an
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.620]  extract guy. I'm a grower. Uh, you take the whole plant and you take a whole bunch of it and you
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:55.940]  make a little bit of, uh, it looks like tar and it's edible or you can rub it on. And it's, uh,
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:00.340]  it's basically all the cannabinoids and all the good parts squished into a little tiny vial.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:05.220]  And he take just a pea sized bite of it. And it's been known to, I can't say cure cancer,
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:11.140]  but stop cancer. And, uh, it Tommy Chong claims that that's what got rid of his prostate cancer.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:17.140]  Wow. Yeah. Real life snake oil. Yeah. Yeah. But the real shit. Yeah. Yeah. As soon as you
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:21.620]  called it snake oil, I was like, Oh, so it's fit. Oh no, but it's, it's miracle shit. But no,
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:25.780]  none of the medical establishments want to recognize that it's actually curing and helping.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.820]  Well, of course not. Cause if it's curing things and they have no job.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:33.220]  Exactly. But there are little girls not having seizures and Tommy Chong doesn't have prostate
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:38.580]  cancer. And, uh, pretty soon our Kev's, our buddy Kev's pops is not going to have his condition.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.860]  If we can find somebody that's willing to help us out with some, I don't know how to do it. And I
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.780]  don't know how much product it takes, but we need somebody to help us out with some RSO.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:50.180]  Definitely. So, uh, Colorado, and you've got a little bit to help us out with, uh,
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.260]  I'll trade you seeds or something. We're willing. We've got a guy in need. He's, uh, we love him.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:59.700]  Yeah. Teach us. We got two really, really smart extract artists. Yeah. And two good growers. So
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:04.580]  we can breed a perfect strain. We could make it, you guys do it. I could have an idea how to,
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.380]  how to make it. I just don't hurt yourself. I've seen it done and it looks fucking scary,
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.460]  dude. It looks scarier than making BHO to me. One of those ingredients too.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:23.220]  We're not even, yeah. So, uh, RSO. Yeah. It's a little tiny bit of it. It's supposed to get rid
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:28.020]  of cancer. And it comes from like a whole, the whole plant, the whole plant, full plant extract.
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:34.740]  I've heard it called full extract cannabis oils. Any other names for Phoenix? Yeah. That's what
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:39.620]  the, so there's a movie called run from the cure or run for the cure race for the cure race. Yeah.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.900]  Race for the cure race for the cure. The break Simpson story. If you guys want to know more
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.220]  about it, check that one out. It's worth, it's worth a watch that YouTube, uh, YouTube will have
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:51.540]  it. I have the DVD of it here somewhere. If you guys I'll hand it to one of you. If I can find it.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:58.580]  Yeah. Cool. I got a very basic question. Um, good. Like, uh, Indico versus Sativa.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:04.740]  Anybody want to laugh them? And that one too. Yeah. He meant the first one. Yeah. This is the
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:08.860]  one he wants to know about your Indica. What's what's blue versus Sativa. Uh,
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:16.580]  so the Indica is more of a strain from Iraq, Afghanistan, Rocky mountainous regions. That
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:20.820]  is more, it'll make you lazier, more couch Lockie. Uh, that's the strains where you will
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:27.140]  find the CBD stuff. Uh, so Sativa is more of a tropical region kind of stuff. It'll grow. So
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.780]  the Indica is grow short and bushy and have bigger, fatter leaves. Uh, they finish earlier
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:36.180]  because where they're from the cold comes and they got to be done sooner and they don't get as tall,
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:41.140]  uh, because they're in rockier areas of the land, less water. Uh, they, the roots actually branch
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:45.620]  out further this way instead of going down because they're in Rocky regions, they can't dig. So they
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:49.540]  stay, they get bushy cause they can, they got bigger feet so they can balance out wider. So
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.740]  T was on the other hand are from tropical areas. So they get real tall and they kind of get airy.
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:57.140]  So they don't get a moldy cause there's humidity there. So they got to get some like a, this is
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.900]  the grossest fucking description. You don't just hot in your ball swing. Yeah. So T was kind of
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:04.180]  spread out a little, the same reason your balls swing a little bit and they get a little, I'm
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.300]  trying to get some space. Yeah. So the city was kind of do that. And if you guys are getting
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.980]  LARPy buds in your grow rooms, it's cause you're overheating. And that's the exact reason why,
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.620]  uh, if you're not growing a good sativa and your shit's airing out, it's cause it's too
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:18.900]  hot. It's trying to get some space. Makes sense. Yeah. So a city was, are more from like a lot of
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:22.900]  Vietnam. Like a lot of stuff is from Vietnam. Like, like Asian countries and stuff like that.
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:26.980]  Why are you laughing? Spence? Cause you're now somebody from Vietnam. Oh, what's up?
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:32.580]  Hey Sean, the phone made my torch. I've said that a couple of times on the show. If you want a
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:38.020]  really cool custom torch, fun phone, he'll do your nails too. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to take a picture
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:44.340]  of it right now, Instagram and I'll tag Jeff in it so he can check it out too. But, uh, well, uh,
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.020]  so that I can check it out. I've never seen it before. Yeah. What's it look like? It's pretty
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:52.340]  cool. I was saying, uh, so your listeners can check it out. Uh, Indica's will finish earlier
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.700]  and because I've seen some that finish in 55, 56 days. Uh, I like to let most plants go at least 60.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:02.340]  I think they're done then. But, uh, and because it'll be done around nine weeks at the longest,
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:07.780]  I've got sativas that take 77 days, which is 11 weeks in flower. That's just the flowering
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:13.540]  cycle. Uh, and they'll grow tall and skinny. And I think they pack on way more THC, like the
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:18.740]  sativa plants. They get you way. I prefer that buzz. So that's the next part of the high, uh,
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.660]  Indica's are the ones when you smoke it and you end up laying on the couch. Uh, that's Indica.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.940]  If you need to calm down, if you need to sleep, if you need to eat, um, that's Indica's the way to
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:31.060]  go. If you need to get the dishes done, if you want to paint, if you want to play music and get
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:35.380]  creative, if you want to ramble on a podcast, smoke some sativas. Okay. Yeah. That's, that's
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:42.420]  kind of the opposite there. No, no. For like a layman like me, somebody that doesn't do this.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:49.220]  And I do feel like, you know, this could be advantageous to writing and stuff like that.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:56.340]  Um, where would I start? You know, who, uh, fine. You would have to three or four dab. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:00.580]  I'd give you a little bit. Let's just do that now. Yeah. Like a half a gram dab is the way to go
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:07.060]  for the start. No, I don't. I don't want to talk. This Mike needs a windscreen. I feel myself
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:11.460]  blowing shit up. Sorry. I got a new mic guys. I kind of like it. Uh, so you would want to pipe
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:15.060]  like this and I'm not encouraging. I'm just showing you a pipe like this with the fresh bowl
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:20.660]  of something. Uh, man, if anybody at this table grew it, it's going to fuck you up one hit and
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:24.100]  you're going to be high from it. So just take one good hit, be hanging out with somebody like us
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:29.220]  that knows what's up. Don't be, don't call your mom. Like mom, I'm so high. Don't do that shit.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:33.140]  Hang out with us. Uh, we'll feed you. We'll get you some water. You're going to want to watch
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:38.660]  some cartoons. Yeah, that sounds normal. Yeah. There's nothing. There's nothing from cannabis,
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.820]  some spaghetti or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich can't cure. Nice. Yeah. That's all
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:46.820]  you need to do is eat and take a nap. And if you're too high or whatever, you'll be fine.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:52.500]  But our good friend, Wade Ridley, that is a good comedian, buddy of yours. What's up, bro? Uh,
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.340]  he'll have an idea, you know, he'll come up with the bit and Carlin said the same thing. He'll
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:01.460]  write a bit and then they'll write it sober and then smoke a little and go back and season it.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:04.820]  That's like putting the dressing on it. You go back and that's when you kind of go and sprinkle
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:08.260]  some detail and get a little funk into it. All right. And that's kind of how I did it as a
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:13.380]  musician too. We'd go to like writing sessions, totally sober, but then you show up for a practice
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.820]  or recording and you smoke a little puff and that's when you start, Oh, I'll check it out.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:21.860]  Then you get a little funkier when you get stoned, you just loosen up a little. Yeah. And I feel like
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.780]  the right strain, some strains don't do this, but the right strain,
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:30.980]  like when you put blinders on a horse, when the horse is at the fair, so it can't see the shit on
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:34.820]  the outside, the left and right, it just focuses on what's in front of it. Good weed, the right
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.860]  strain does that to me. And it puts me just boom in the focus. So if I'm playing music or growing
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:46.580]  weed, watching a movie, uh, playing a video game, I am in that shit. Like just that it's like
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.500]  goggles for me. Trimming. Trimming. Oh yeah. Dude, give me a, one of those Indica Chiba chews
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:58.420]  and sent me down to trim and time flies and I trim the whole crop. It's awesome. But, but for a non
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:01.780]  smoker where they're going to get started is probably just try to start with a pipe. Yeah.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:05.620]  Try to maybe a joint or a pipe and just one or two good puffs is all you need. If somebody here
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:10.260]  grew up one puff, if you got it from the dispensary, take two and just put it down and see what happens.
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:14.260]  If you don't feel high enough, you'll know we're going to take your time. I mean, really? Well,
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:18.100]  some people don't, you know, some people like the edible people that have just been scarfing the
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.940]  whole snack thinking that they're Superman and getting hurt and shit. Yeah. See, and that's
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.460]  something that I had kind of thought, like I was like, man, the edibles are probably like, where
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:30.100]  do you want to start? But that's way wrong. Uh, yeah. The edibles will sneak up on you. Spence
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:35.460]  is nodding one night. Spence's lady, uh, they made some dabs in a Pyrex dish like you're supposed to
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:39.540]  do. And we had plenty, so they didn't want to scrape it all out. You know, there's some residuals
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:44.100]  in there. She put the dish in the oven to heat it up and all the dabs soak to the bottom or sunk
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:51.060]  like in a puddle, she poured a brownie mix on top of that shit. And I think there were four or six
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:57.060]  grown men in that room that ate that shit. And all of us were comatose. It wrecked us. And I can't
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:01.860]  get that high from smoking. Like it would take all day to smoke that much. So that's pro level
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:06.260]  status. That was dude. It was super Mario versus the dragon in the fucking tunnel, trying to fight
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:12.260]  Metroid on level three. Like it was, it was insane, dude. That's seeing that's just kind of something
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:18.020]  where I don't know where the, uh, where my thoughts came from on that. Like, I guess I just thought,
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.060]  you know, you would, you would just start with brownies or something. Just have a piece of a
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.980]  brownie and that's where you'll start. Oh, it'll last four or five times longer if you eat a
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:30.740]  brownie too. Yeah. Edibles last a long time. I get, I feel drunk. Uh, I've had nights where I've
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.980]  eaten too many edibles where I've woken up and been like, Holy shit, what did I do? Like, and
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:41.460]  you feel weed hangover. Yeah. I don't complain from it. I don't mind it. I like it. That's
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:46.420]  been a while. So no thanks. I'm too hyper. So I got to smoke the Indica's to kind of keep me
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:52.580]  mellow when I'm smoking flowers. But when I smoke dabs, I prefer a sativa for that headspin.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:58.180]  Yeah, for sure. You agree? Yeah. Word. I like edibles to sleep. Like if I can't sleep,
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:03.780]  yeah. We'll put you down. Yeah. That's what I use it for. I like to eat edibles before a comedy show.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:07.540]  I'm going to see some comedy this weekend and I'll definitely stop at a dispensary and pick up
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:12.100]  too many edibles and overdose myself for the show. Right on. Yeah. Good. 300 milligrams. Ooh,
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:18.180]  I'll be nice and high. TKO bar. Exactly. A TKO and then some clotty bears. Yeah. Oh,
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:23.060]  cloudy bears. Yeah. That's the perfect combo for me. But for those guys coming from out of state
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:27.940]  that haven't had the experience that we do here in Colorado and they go to a place, they go to
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:32.820]  just go buy something. Start with weed and a pipe. Yeah. Start with weed and a pipe. Maybe a joint.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:37.140]  Don't buy a pre-roll from a dispensary. Never buy a pre-roll from a dispensary. They're giving you
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.580]  all the shit that fell on the floor while they're trimming. You're going to have a bad time. You're
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:46.820]  going to have a bad time. I like that. See, there you go, Texas. You're welcome. We love you, Texas.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:51.460]  We're trying to make peace with you by offering good weed. And please be careful with edibles.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:57.060]  Yeah. So yeah, start off with like a pipe or a joint. And then if you're going to eat an edible,
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:01.460]  get something. If you get a hundred milligram edible, seriously eat a quarter of it and wait
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:07.220]  45 minutes. 25 milligrams doesn't sound like much of THC, but for a skinny dude like Kevin's size,
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:10.820]  that's never eaten edibles. That's plenty. Dude, a lot of people that come into the shop,
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:16.020]  that's too much for them. Like they need like an eighth of it or a 10th of it.
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:22.580]  Wow. 10 milligrams. Yeah. They seriously need like 10, 15 milligrams and they're perfect.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:27.540]  A lot of like never tried weed in their entire life. Yeah. And they're scared of that thing.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:34.420]  Yeah. And it's a pipe smoking. You know, they don't smoke at all. Anything ever. So there were
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:39.060]  people at the cannabis cup this weekend that we were in line for two hours, dude. So about an
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:43.860]  hour into it, Kevin and I pulled out our dab rigs out of our backpacks and just started dabbing like
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:49.140]  champs. Oh, some's cutting out here. It's me. I'm too loud. Sorry. My fault. So we started dabbing
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:55.940]  and some people, Chicago people were like, what the fuck? What is that? It's dabs, bro. You want
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:01.620]  one? And they're like, I don't know. I don't know, man. I gave a guy his first dab at a party
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:06.420]  and his eyes were better than your shirt, bros. Spence is wearing a red Nike shirt and it is
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:11.700]  blood red for sure. And his eyes were that red. Your ears are too. I can feel them.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.820]  Yeah. Those tabs are no joke. Yeah. We got some good dads at the table. I've got this fat dab
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.500]  sitting here. I'm going to take it out of this little roster rig off of a highly educated
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.460]  14 millimeter flux nail. Cause that's what I flux with.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.540]  Is there a strain for a non-user that you would recommend?
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.060]  Is said non-user a medical patient or just a recreational smoker?
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:40.660]  This is going to be Rick or a, you know what? I think that's, I don't know. What do you think
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:44.180]  your listeners are going to want to hear? Honestly, I think they want to hear both. So
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:49.540]  for a medical patient, I'm going to see how it elaborated. Like you're going for, I always ask
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:53.620]  above the head or below the head or like spine or brain. Like there's all, there's a couple
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:59.700]  of questions there. Toro, Tora Bora is an all around good strain for new smokers. It's high
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:05.140]  in CBD. It's low in THC. You'll get a nice tingly body buzz. If you're a new smoker, your body will
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:10.100]  feel good and high, but you won't freak out. You won't get paranoid. It's not so high in THC and
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.500]  THC V and THC aid that your head is going to spin and you're going to get paranoid. Cause that's
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:18.020]  what ruins the high for a lot of people. Their first time they're so high, they're scared and
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.820]  paranoid and freaking out and you won't get that from the Toro Bora. Also for a medical smoker,
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:28.820]  Toro Bora, a rec and medical, I guess. If you want to get head wrecked, go for a strong sativa,
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.900]  get some sour diesel. I'm not sure if that's really sativa, but when I smoke it, I can't pay
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:38.980]  any attention. Like I'm a pro and sour diesel messes me up. I can't sit down on diesel. Yeah.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:43.220]  Sour diesel. Yeah. It's the one that makes you want to do the dishes and all kinds of stuff like
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:48.580]  that. Yeah. You just brought up something really funny. I'm going to give a plug to another podcast
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:54.820]  just cause they clear up a lot of myths. The Adam Dunn show for sure had Ken dog and AJ and
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:59.780]  P bud. I think his name was on the show and they talked about a lot of cool stuff. So you guys
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:03.860]  check that out. If you're a fan of my show, you'd like the Adam Dunn show. If you have questions
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:10.420]  about a sour diesel, a dabber, there you go. Nice catch. If you've got questions about sour diesel,
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:14.020]  if you've got questions about the chem dog, the people that made that shit and a stat, well,
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:18.260]  they didn't make it. The people that made it famous. Yeah. They, uh, they do a show and you
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:22.980]  want to hear it like that's a plug for another podcast. I listened to it, so it's good. It's
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:26.020]  good. Yeah. I think everybody here at the table, it's a weed smoker. Kevin and I listened to it
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:30.660]  together. I think so. Yeah. We all heard it. Listen to that shit. Adam Dunn, Mitch and NASA,
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:33.380]  all those guys. Great show. Bike. Good show guys. If you ever hear my show,
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:38.820]  I'm not the only one listening. That's funny. Somebody talk while I take a dab.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:45.540]  Um, the, the, the Pueblo cup that you guys just did. Um, how, how prestigious is that? How many
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:49.940]  entries and stuff like that are there? I mean, how many categories and stuff like that? It was,
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:56.100]  uh, it was their first event. Oh, okay. So everybody's first event is kind of, you know,
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:01.060]  it's the first one. So nobody knows exactly what to do. Yeah. Um, but I mean, there was entries
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:09.620]  from, you know, pin rows, local Pueblo dispensary, Pueblo, um, a couple other local growers.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:15.700]  Um, so it was, I mean, it wasn't a large event, but I mean, it was the first one. It was the
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:19.940]  first one. You know what I'm saying? So next time can always be better. Are they going to do it
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:23.860]  annually or is it going to be, I think it'll be annually. Um, yeah, I think that's planned.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:29.060]  And, and is there a reason they did it in April? 424 20. Oh yeah.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:36.260]  See, I'm thinking like, yeah, I understand that when I got it's like our super bowl and actually
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:42.580]  with the cannabis scope, it's rapidly becoming that literally. Yeah. I was thinking, um, uh,
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:46.020]  that maybe there was something to do with the growth cycle or something like a good harvesting
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:52.260]  time that that would have been. That's why, but maybe, I don't know when, if you are doing it
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:57.620]  outdoors, you're not going to have like indoor conditions like that. You can control your,
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:04.020]  your outdoors. So when is the harvest when you're outdoors? Uh, fall. Yeah. Right around
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:10.500]  Halloween or depending on your strain conditions in Colorado, right before the first snowfall.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:14.900]  Yeah. Yeah. You sit outside and you wait. And as soon as you see snow, you go cut that shit down
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:18.980]  because Colorado, you got to let them go right until then sometimes, or you pull out the hoop
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:24.740]  houses and the heaters. Yeah. People get elaborate. Yes, we do. But basically right around
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:30.420]  Halloween is usually about harvest time. Okay. Yeah. So, so why isn't, uh, and then how long,
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:35.460]  um, after say harvest and then it takes you a couple of weeks to trim everything,
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:39.380]  depending on the size of the harvest, didn't dry and cured up two or three weeks. And then,
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:43.700]  and then after you're done trimming, uh, how long until that weed is able to be smoked
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:48.900]  depending on your, uh, thirst for the money right then, or you can cure it for a couple of weeks
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:54.980]  or your trim style too, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. And then, and then in good conditions,
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:49:00.820]  how long can that weed stay good? Six months ish. I've seen weed last a year, but six months is
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.820]  before it'll start degrading and shit in a jar sealed. All right. So maybe the end of may would
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:10.900]  be the end of, excuse me. Maybe the end of may would be like the try to get rid of everything.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.460]  So I guess April 20th would be like a good time. People flush out all their, that's why you see
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:19.700]  the dispensaries with all their sales. They're getting rid of last year's outdoor stuff. Oh,
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.260]  I think with the whole four 20. Yeah. I also think with the holiday that it's becoming a lot of
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:29.220]  growers shoot for that. They plant and there's like, there's cups, there's contests, you know
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:34.100]  what I'm saying? And there are actually a harvest ball, uh, cannabis competitions, but we're so busy.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:38.100]  Uh, if you've got a big outdoor grow, you're just too busy at that season to even do anything.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.460]  You've got a big harvest. You're trying to trim it and cure it. You got to flip it. You got to
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:45.300]  pay your trimmers. You got to get back cleaned up. You got to get shit going. Like it's a busy
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:50.260]  time of year. So it makes sense. No, that's, that's all good information that, you know,
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:54.820]  if, if somebody was wanting to attend one of those, there's a good reason that it's in April,
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:59.300]  like that you're not super busy at that part. When, when are you starting like to,
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:02.180]  when do you start planting stuff when you're outside? No.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:06.980]  Um, today is end of April. It's still a little early here.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:16.020]  June 1st. Yeah. June 1st is a good day. I mean, so somewhere, um, towards the end of July,
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:19.620]  beginning of September, did I say that right? Oh, August.
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:30.100]  That's when most strains will start flowering. Um, outdoors I've seen plants,
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:34.900]  you know, go a little faster than what they did indoors. I've seen the exact opposite.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:42.180]  Um, but you know, that's where, when you go from the, it stops growing and starts, well,
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:48.100]  not necessarily stops growing, but, um, that's when it starts producing a flower, a fruit.
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:54.740]  And that's the, that's the cone. Um, the bud. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And that's what we're a little
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:59.220]  white pistols. Yeah, for sure. For sure. The part you're smoking. Yeah. That part takes about
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:04.820]  nine weeks to develop ish, depending on the strain. Yeah. That last stab fucked me up. I'm
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:10.500]  having a good time talking. Uh, I didn't even ask you how your four 20 was other than other than
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:18.980]  your victory. Um, yeah, yeah. Went to Canada's cup on Saturday and, uh, worked sold t-shirts
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:25.140]  for the greener side. Yeah. I was that, um, I smoked a lot of weed. We stopped by the booth
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:31.860]  and it was chaotic. Yeah, it was chaos. It was nice. Um, checked it out a little, so, um,
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:38.340]  then, uh, hit up the bud bowl on a Sunday. You mean anybody cool at the cup? Um, Danny Danko,
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:50.260]  um, giddy up. Um, I think that's it. Probably. I saw some cats, but you know, working and shit.
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:54.500]  So yeah, I'm sure you were busy, dude. I stopped by that booth and it was crazy.
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:58.420]  I was right there on the other side of the gauge booth. A lot of the time. Oh, nice. Yeah. That's
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:06.100]  my buddy. How about you spent? How was your four 20? Um, it was fun. The, the cup was crazy. It
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:11.380]  was, there was a lot of people. I'm not the people person. I mean, I like, I like people, but there's
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:18.100]  just like thousands of people around you. So I like this smoke too. So you can't really just smoke
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:24.820]  walking around with 10,000 people around you. Um, but it was fun. I got to, um, see a bunch of
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:31.380]  people that I wanted to meet. Um, also pick up genetics. Um, you know, that was a lot of people's
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:35.220]  goal. Pick up a lot of genetics. Hey, uh, when you say pick up a genetics, what do you mean?
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:44.420]  Get caught on his face buying seeds in my beard. Lots of come in the beard. That's how we, uh,
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:48.580]  all the breeders go and they have booths, all the seed makers. So you could buy seeds of almost
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.100]  all the hottest strains, most of the hottest strains on the market. You could pick those up
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.740]  at the cup for discount prices. And if you know the guys and he make buddies, they'll throw you
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:00.100]  freebies and shit. If you buy them straight from them, it's a lot cheaper and you get some hookups.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:06.660]  Now are those, uh, like feminized when they come? Uh, some, some, some and reg. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:16.020]  Um, what, what would, um, what constitutes it being feminized? Like it will, uh, 99.9% of those
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:21.620]  plants will be females. Okay. From those seeds. Yeah. Not always. Well, if done right. And then
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:27.700]  you get G bubba. Yeah. Uh, there's some strains that have failed and it's just breeding techniques.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:32.100]  Some genes don't match up properly, so they don't make good seeds and you have to throw those away.
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:36.260]  But those come from a specific plant that are going to produce female plants,
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:42.500]  female seeds, feminized seeds. Uh, so I take a female plant and I treat it a specific way and
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:47.460]  that makes it turn into a male, but it doesn't actually have any male genetics in it. I just
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:52.500]  kind of stressed it to do that. And so when it produces that pollen, there's no male chromosomes
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:56.820]  in there. Wow. So when it hits the female, it's only female genetics that are combining
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:03.140]  once women figure it out. We're all fucked. Yeah. Females. I hope you weren't listening to that.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:11.380]  Yeah. Shit. Shit. I explained it to my girlfriend once and that was kind of my reply. Her reply.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:15.540]  We should just end the show with a suction sound and then we're all done right there.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:20.020]  Once women figured out we're fucked. That's it. The end. You'll never hear from us again.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:24.020]  The hate tweets we're going to get from this. Oh no, no, I don't think we'll get hate.
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:28.260]  Our listeners love us. They're all stoned. All right. So you were at the cup. What'd you,
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:34.420]  did you go to some concert? I saw some pictures, bro. Um, yeah, I went to a dizzy concert. He's a
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:40.980]  somewhat of a new hip hop artist out of Las Vegas. Um, he's got a good movement. You know,
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:47.300]  he's all about like, he makes a song called world peace, you know, and he smokes a lot of herbs. So
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:53.380]  I was fortunate enough to be able to give him some weed. Um, cause who knows where he's getting his
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:58.340]  weed from. So I figured, Hey, I'll give you some weed. I saw his Instagram cause he was giving you
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:02.740]  shout outs. He liked your weed, bro. Uh, there's a picture of him holding the garden of weed and
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:07.620]  jar and he looks faded. I think he's actually next to you standing next to you in that picture. Yeah.
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:12.100]  And he looks high as shit. It's cool though. Cause you go into like, and honestly it wasn't
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:17.620]  like a big venue is that a Cervantes in Denver. Yeah. So it was just the backstage is like
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:25.620]  an old locker room. Oh damn. That was hot. Who saw that? So, uh, it was cool. We just placed down,
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:29.380]  got to give them some stickers. So who knows where those, maybe those stickers will make it somewhere.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:34.260]  Yeah. Well I saw where some of them made it. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that too. Yeah. And some ratchet booty,
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:39.460]  some ratchet. Where would we, uh, what's your, what's your Instagram? Do you want people knowing
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:44.180]  that? Yeah, that's cool. It's a garden of weed and garden weed. He grows some really, really nice
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:47.540]  stuff. He works with some of my strains, uh, some of the Irish genetic seed line. He was one of my
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:54.660]  testers. I work with Jesse's as well too. I do a bunch of growing for hit, not for him, but I'll
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:56:00.340]  grow some same strains that he grows just to kind of have them around since we're on plugs, bro.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:05.940]  Where do we find you? Uh, Jesse grows all one board Instagram. He's got some lovely cannabis
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:10.980]  picks. That's where I got my, uh, ghost Bubba. That's a fire strain. I've got a lot of good
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:15.060]  stuff from him. I got my white widow cut from Spence over here for sure. Yeah. How about you,
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:21.380]  Clint? Where do we find you? Uh, at tall Clint, Twitter, Instagram, then a wild cousins on
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:28.020]  Facebook at tall client. Hey, I didn't even say it to the aspect. I know. It was awesome on our
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:31.940]  other show. He, uh, he's, he's got some Tourette's and every once in a while the conversation will be
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.420]  going and you'll just, you're at talk. No, that's Carl. That's fun, bro. Do you have anything you
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:41.700]  want to check out online? Uh, not really. I don't know. Don't look at you. Don't, don't look at me
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:47.140]  online. Yeah, I'm not interesting at all. That's no longer interesting. All right guys, you want
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:51.780]  to stretch out one more question. We got like about 10 more minutes. Sure. One more good question.
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:56.100]  I, I know that like hemp is important for, for, uh,
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:03.940]  just becoming a better society, honestly. Like there's so much we can do with it. Um,
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:13.380]  I know that we can only grow it or can we grow it now? Is that like, is that legal now? Can we
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:20.180]  grow it like in a field? Untested. Oh, well in a field. Nevermind. That's, that's another question.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:29.380]  I thought you meant in a garden. Like, well, well, I think so because, uh, until now, uh, uh, Dr.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:32.820]  Bronner's had to buy all of their hemp in Canada and have it shipped here. And I'm pretty sure that
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:37.620]  the first hemp crop that was produced in America was purchased here in Colorado. It was purchased
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:42.740]  by Dr. Bronner's. So there's some legal way that we can grow hemp crops here now. I'm ignorant to
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:47.300]  that. Okay. And my computer is way over there. Yeah. Yeah. I unfortunately don't know all the
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:52.660]  specifics. Um, you guys are growing for different purposes. Completely. Yeah. Yeah. But that's a
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:55.860]  good question that we should understand. Cause that's part of our industry and hemp is really
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:00.660]  reliable. That's something that we should be. Oh, okay. Uh, the government did just do something
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:05.780]  to make it, there was a hemp bill. I'm going to sound real ignorant, but I'll give you this much.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:12.420]  There was a hemp bill that got approved. Um, and then in Colorado, I believe they just issued the
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:20.020]  first licenses this year. Um, the actual license last year's crop was just kind of gray zone,
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:26.980]  testing the boundaries, getting the guy's feet wet. But, uh, yeah, in a nutshell, that's
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:34.260]  so like the first industrial license, like industrial hemp crop. I saw pictures. Yeah.
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:40.500]  It was down in a Springfield. Um, yeah, I wrote hemp crop on the, uh, on the notes here. That'll
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.700]  be something that I'll try to talk about on one of the next upcoming shows. That's a good topic.
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:49.380]  Um, Adam Dunn would be a great, great guy to answer those questions. Yeah. I'll see him up at
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:53.060]  hood lab pretty soon here. Shout out to the hood lab, dude. Those guys threw an awesome party.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:56.020]  Yeah. That was a shitload of fun. I didn't ask you about your four 20, bro. We talked about that
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:00.180]  on the last show. So yeah, starting with, yeah, as long as you're cool. If you listened to the
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:04.820]  last show, then you know all about my four 20. It's pretty epic. So yeah. A shout out to Adam
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:09.940]  Dunn. He threw a hell of a party. We all hit the hive nail, the ceramic, uh, anybody gotten
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:13.300]  reviews or opinions you want to throw down at that? At this towards the end of the show, I'm
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:19.700]  high. I'm stuttering. It's awesome. Very high. Um, I don't mind it. Um, I like the flavor. The
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:24.900]  flavors a little bit better than titanium. I would say, I guess, depending on what you're
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:30.100]  dabbing, it's smooth. It's smooth. Um, only reason I don't like it is because I broke mine.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:37.300]  So it's cool. It wasn't like, it wasn't as expensive as titanium. So it's, it's,
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:45.380]  if you break it, you can probably buy another one. Um, but I don't know if, were there directions
[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:48.900]  in yours? Yeah. Okay. See, I didn't read directions. That's probably why I broke it.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:55.540]  So I'm a, I guess I am a fan of it. I just need to get a new one. Cool. Yeah. I love mine. I've
[01:59:55.540 --> 02:00:00.260]  been using it pretty much nonstop since I got it. Props for the nice little rig too. That thing
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:07.140]  hits. Yeah. Sneaky. The dudes that I got it from hooked me up pretty nice on it. So got a little
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:12.180]  pendant rig from him too. So that was fucking awesome. I don't even remember their fucking
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:16.820]  name. I asked him like four times. Yeah. Their sign was hard to read. It was something street.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:21.860]  They're from New Jersey, maybe Jersey, Jersey boys. That's what we'll call them. Those Jersey
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.340]  boys. Gluesome. Great. Gruesome. Fuck. Gruesome. Great. Gruesome. Great. Yeah.
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:32.500]  Chris Christie, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are suck it along with everybody at the
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:39.940]  NSA. All of you. Yeah. All at once. One big Bukkake session. Uh, hive nail. Did you, did
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:45.940]  you have any opinions on it? Um, I'm a, like I said, I'm a big guy. It scares me. Oh, my school,
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:53.780]  just a mic. Go ahead. It was smooth. Um, it's, uh, it's hard to tell how hot it is. Like that
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:58.340]  was my biggest point. And like you say, I'm a big guy. I'm kind of afraid to break it. Yeah.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:05.140]  I think, uh, I like my highly educated. See, uh, I didn't pay him to say that. He doesn't even know
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:09.220]  that the show is sponsored by highly educated titanium products. He didn't know that. So this
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:14.980]  show is bought by highly educated titanium products. I'm sure that's, that's everybody's
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:20.580]  phrase. I'm sure he's probably just mute to it by now. Yeah. It doesn't even, yeah. It's just like
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:24.340]  when you're a girl, we're giving me some seeds. You didn't even hunt. What? Did you say something?
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:30.020]  Sorry. Clones. What? No, those don't exist. Anyway. I don't know about clones. Uh, so it's my turn. I
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.380]  like the hive dude. It tastes good. You're right. It's hard to tell if it's hot enough. I agree with
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:38.420]  that. I'm a big guy. I'm afraid I'm going to break it. I agree with that. Uh, I can't use my
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:42.900]  preexisting carb cap and dabber that I'm in love with. And so I got to buy all new shit for that,
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:48.420]  which I mean, for me, that's not a big deal. I do. Okay. But some people are not privileged
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:52.260]  and doing well and they can only buy a few dab things. So I guess here's my, my sum up. If you
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:56.580]  can only buy one nail, get titanium because you're going to break the hive eventually. For sure. But
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:00.740]  if you're spoiled and you want to try something, if you're a spoiled hashbrad, if you're a connoisseur,
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:05.860]  so if you're from Colorado, I personally don't recommend it for like your travel rigs,
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:11.060]  like don't have it towards bouncing around and shit like at home, your heady pieces,
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:14.980]  you know what I mean? You just chilling on the table. Yeah. Put it on your coil.
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:20.500]  If you know what I mean by coil, then if you've got a coil condenser, put it on your coil. And
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.940]  there's no way to hook it up to so far that I know of, I could be totally wrong. I've never
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:28.740]  seen a way to hook it up to an email. I don't know of yet. Once they get that going, I think
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:33.380]  that constant heat would probably bust it, but that would be, it should be using a honey hole
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.340]  anyway. If you're doing that, shout out Joel Halen. But I do like, I definitely do like highly
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:42.660]  educated titanium for sure. I don't find anything wrong with it at all. Well, that's where I'm
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:47.220]  headed. If you can only afford one nail, highly educated, either the, uh, whatever size you got,
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:52.100]  go for the duality. That's probably my favorite nail of all of theirs. The duality, the flux,
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:57.860]  the turbine flux. Uh, that's the, uh, so the, the flux is the one here. It's got the holes in the
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.740]  side and then the turbine flux has like a cone shape on the inside. So your Earl kind of swirls
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:08.100]  around. Uh, the turbine flux is my favorite. Uh, my second, if you have a dome, the turbine flux,
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:13.780]  if you're going domeless, go for the duality. Yeah, that's. And then a carb cap of course.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:20.180]  And I use my carb cap on my dome rig too. And it works really well. That was a fat plug right there,
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:25.140]  man. That was nice. Cool. Uh, one more question, bro. Cause that was a quick question. It ended
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:30.660]  up more of us rambling about hemp. Um, like what laws are coming out right now that we need to be
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:37.700]  aware of? Like, I know that like on, on the, I grow culture Twitter, um, you had posted a few
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:42.100]  things like, or look at, look at these guys, look at these guys. There are two of them that we should
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:49.380]  pay attention to. Uh, SB 77 and 78 is, uh, the drug endangered child act. Uh, they're going to
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:55.060]  make it to our what's humming. That's a weird sound. That sounds like a drag car. Wow. Wow,
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:04:00.580]  dude. When you guys got some gas over there or no, some taco bell. So, uh, SB 77 and 78,
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:06.260]  the drug endangered child act, uh, it basically is accidentally aimed at, uh, cannabis users.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:11.060]  If you have marijuana and utensils in your home and you have children, you're endangering your
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:17.700]  child. Maybe not accidentally. Yeah. And that's good. That was another part of my rant on that
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:22.260]  too is we're giving kids cannabis now cause it helps. So that's something we need to fight
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:26.900]  against because that accidentally, like if I had this in another room and my daughter was on the
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:30.660]  couch, that's a drug endangered child in their eyes with the new act. So we need to fight that
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:35.300]  down. And on the Instagram for agriculture or on the Twitter, there's plenty of info of people to
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:40.580]  email and talk shit to about that. Uh, the other one, I can't remember the numbers of it. It's a
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:46.340]  caregiver act that's trying to limit, uh, Colorado caregivers to 30 plants maximum, no matter what
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:52.100]  your location or status. Okay. Uh, that's kind of bullshit for a lot of reasons, for several
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:56.180]  reasons. We went over it on a whole episode, but if you're a, if you have a perpetual grow and
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:01.220]  you've got five patients that require the amount of dabs that my patients require, uh, 30 plants
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:06.100]  won't cut it. Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of people grow small hydroponic plants and there's a reason why
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:10.900]  their doctors recommended them a certain amount of plants. And now there's going to be a new law.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:14.580]  It's like, we're playing football. We're playing football, right? You caught this pass. You got
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:17.780]  super close to the end zone. You got tackled. You're cool, right? You're doing good. But then
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:21.780]  suddenly the ref comes out and goes, Oh wait, new rule, new rule. You can't wear purple. How you're
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:25.220]  wearing purple back the fuck up 20 yards. And you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:28.900]  know about that rule. You just made, and that's what they're doing to us. Caregivers have been
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:35.780]  around for 14 years. You know, as long as amendment 20 has been, um, no issues up until now.
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:40.900]  And it's all about the patients and the caregivers without that relationship, it wouldn't exist. The
[02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.820]  whole model would fall apart and they're trying to make more people have to shop at dispensaries.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:48.980]  And the dispensaries are already out of medical weed, but they have plenty of recreational weed,
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:53.540]  which I think is a whole nother rant. That's bullshit. So that's, it's about money in the long
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:58.660]  run is what I think taking the money away from, uh, and it's not, they don't realize we don't
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:02.900]  make any money being a caregiver. There's no money in it because we don't take a lot of money from
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:06.500]  our patients because they're sick people. They're most of them don't work like the people I work
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:11.300]  with don't have a real job. They're actually sick. So I don't take money from them and growing weed
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:16.420]  costs time, money, and energy. So I lose money, honestly, being a grower, like a caregiver.
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:20.900]  They're on fixed budgets. Yeah. So they're trying to, they think that they're going to
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:26.340]  funnel money into their system from it, which they kind of will. But in the long run, my patients are
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:31.460]  going to go in pain or sick or what if, uh, what if you're working with cash, hide cash, I'd had a
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:35.620]  tumor the size of a golf ball. And the only thing that was keeping them alive was some cannabis oil.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:40.020]  And if they limit his growers production, his tumor is going to grow back and he's passed
[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:44.420]  already now, unfortunately bless him. But he's a good example. And he died because they took away
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:47.780]  his cannabis. And that's kind of what they're going to do to people. And people are moving
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:52.100]  here because of the availability. And now they're like, Oh, new rules. And I don't find it fair.
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:56.180]  So that's something we need to shoot down. Yeah. I think that was a good question. Thank you.
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:59.540]  Yeah, dude. No, I'm happy to be the ignorant guy. Honestly.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:02.980]  We'll have you back because you do ask a great questions. Hey guys, if you're listening,
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:08.900]  uh, tweet us at, uh, at agriculture and send us your questions. Cause that's, uh, I'd like to
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.180]  educate and help you guys. If you have some of those, I heard this and you don't know if it's
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.700]  true, send it to me. You can send it to me privately, even if you want, and I won't say
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:20.420]  your name that way. You can not be embarrassed. If you feel like that, I invite all of your
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:23.460]  questions. There's a Facebook, there's an Instagram, there's a Twitter. I've been posting
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:27.940]  up some cool pictures on my, uh, I read genetics, Instagram, check those out. I don't plug that very
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:32.500]  much. So usually we do a portion of the show right towards the end called give thanks where we give
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:37.540]  thanks to a person who has heavily contributed to the cannabis industry. Last week we cried.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:40.660]  It was awesome. Bless you, Jenny Cush. We still miss you. We still love you this time.
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:46.580]  Got a really easy one. Didn't take a lot of research. Uh, I saw it all weekend long. I want
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:52.660]  to give thanks to everybody, everybody, everybody in the cannabis four 27, 10, the ganja movement
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:56.500]  from Clint with questions to the growers, to the breeders, to the smokers, to the dabbers,
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:00.900]  to Danny Danko, to freaking the guys learning to write to everybody you've heard of gauge green,
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:05.940]  TGA sub cool, Kelly connection, John Hunt's deep hill, everybody that you've ever not heard of.
[02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:11.380]  All of them. Thank you. Uh, that's what makes it a community. It's what makes it a movement.
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:16.340]  All of you guys without all of us doing our little parts, there wouldn't be this, uh, without the
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:20.820]  Colorado people doing what we did. We couldn't sit here and dab out at a table. I had a guest
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:26.420]  on that told me dabs in Texas were a felony and you could do life in prison. Yeah, dude. Yeah.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.220]  Look at my table. Look at my table and think about that. We're all going to prison.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:35.380]  We're going to have the coolest prison. Kevin's got a lot of boyfriends. Suddenly
[02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:40.100]  you're all of our girlfriend, buddy. I'm trying to find them all off anyway.
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:46.500]  Uh, so that was a long rant, but it was heartfelt. Uh, really without all the giant,
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:50.980]  without all the little pieces, the giant machine wouldn't function. Uh, I saw a lot of unity at
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:54.500]  the cannabis cup this year. I was kind of proud because this industry has gotten clicky and I
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:58.820]  didn't see any of that bullshit at the cup. People that, uh, people that hate each other,
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:02.660]  saw each other and gave each other hugs and made amends. And it was kind of cool. So that's my give
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:06.580]  thanks this episode. All of you guys, everybody, if you're listening, if you're not listening,
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:10.660]  if you've ever smoked weed, if you've thought about weed, if you fought for weed, uh, if you
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:15.300]  flicked a roach somewhere, if you found a roach somewhere, like you got anything to do with weed,
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:19.460]  thank you. Uh, we give you thanks. Thanks for being part of our family. Uh, anybody got anything
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:23.620]  to say at the end of the show? This is it. I think we should try that grape OG real quick
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:28.660]  and give a little, a little review on that. I'll hand the ball to the guy that brought it.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:32.980]  He doesn't want to tell us the genetics of it though. He's keeping one parent secret.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:37.620]  It's a cool if I plug a couple of shows, do it, dude, do it. I got a may 2nd. We'll be at Phil's
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:42.980]  radiator here in Pueblo. We're going to be a, that's a local standouts, uh, for the first
[02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:50.180]  part, first Friday after party, um, be up in Manitou, uh, May 17th. Oh, you man, the two hippies
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:54.980]  go see some comedy. He's funny. Thank you. I appreciate that. Oh, for sure. Thank you. And
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:59.620]  then we're bringing some, uh, big names through Pueblo. Uh, on May 27th, we got a couple of people,
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:05.380]  uh, coming from LA, David Ross and Amber Tozer. And then we got, uh, one of my favorite comedians,
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:16.260]  Sam talent coming down from Denver. Nice. Well, yeah, well, Hey, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So much better
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:21.220]  looking than I am. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So unfortunately I've seen a lot more of your skin.
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:27.060]  Yeah. Well, that's how things go. Um, but each of these shows is only $5. You'd be helping us
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:32.100]  out a lot just to come and laugh. Um, and we got open mics and stuff like that. I mean, find us on
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:38.820]  wild cousins on Facebook. It's we we're trying to, we're trying to make Pueblo better and, uh,

[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:49.700]  You know, I quit smoking cigarettes. I got an e-cig now. Like I, and he puffs on that thing.
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:54.420]  They're like a pacifier. Yeah. Yeah. He nurses that bitch. Yeah. No, it's, it's really bad.
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:58.980]  So tell us who's all in the wild cousins since we're on that topic. Oh, it's, uh, myself,
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:02.660]  uh, Paul Rosales. Fuck him. No, I'm just kidding. Whoever you were going to say, fuck him.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:08.660]  John Bueno. Fuck him too. Yeah. And it's a little tiny hands. Previn Marquez. I love that guy so
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:13.140]  much. I can't even joke about him. Yeah. He's great. Yeah. And then, uh, Matt Chapman. Oh,

[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:30.660]  been doing it, you know, eight months or so. Like most of us down here, but I think we're getting
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:37.060]  better. So we're working on it. That's all it is. That stuff tastes really good. Thank you.
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:44.260]  Hit it right. Yeah. It was nice and smooth. Very, very, uh, surprising, uh, outcome. I've
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:47.540]  run towards the microphone. Like I could share it with the listeners. Like they would get a taste.
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:53.460]  Okay. I taste the grape. That's very smooth. Yeah. It's Ling. It's like I had some great
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:58.820]  bubble gum in my mouth. Go for it. I just tried to pass it to clay. I'm going to hit that very
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:02.980]  well done, bro. I see why you can win some stuff. All right. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.780]  Congrats on your winnings guys. We're going to end the show with some music. I don't know what
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:09.700]  we're going to play yet. I'll piece in it at the end piece it in at the end. Language is hard after
[02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:15.620]  a lot of dabs. So excuse us. Any last words? It's your last chance. Yeah. If anybody likes or
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:20.900]  dislikes this, uh, let Jeff know. Cause we'll, you know, we'll, we'll try to format to what people
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:24.980]  like. We'll take a dab and laugh about it. Yeah. But, but if you don't like me being on here and
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.580]  asking stupid questions and let them know if you do, if you think it's had value, let us know.
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:32.420]  He's coming back. Cause I like his, his, uh, element. You bring a lot. Yeah. We forget we're
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:36.180]  pots and obscene elitist. We forget that people aren't all up to speed. So it's great having you
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:41.140]  here. Honestly, I'm not just rubbing your ass. No, not this time. Not this time. Not this time.

[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:26.440]  hookah bar, got scrutinized for their private dab parties. We're going to mention something about a
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:34.280]  weed symphony. And we're going to read a little bit about a review of a Denver Post article
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:40.040]  that has a bunch of frequently asked questions and they respond with some weird and sometimes
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.040]  accurate answers. So we're going to read a little bit about that if we have time and turn this music
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.600]  down, introduce our buddy hanging out with us. We got Kevin back. What's up, bro? What's up, dude?
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.080]  How you been? Been good, man. Hanging out, hanging out. Nice. Everything's been real busy since 420.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.880]  Everyone thought it was going to calm down. Not in this industry, man. It never comes down. It just
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:02.600]  keeps building and building. And building. I think we drummed up more business and it just made us
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:08.760]  even busier. I'm not complaining. I love it. Oh my gosh. I've been busy. It's fun. It's a good
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:13.800]  industry to be busy in. Definitely. Yeah. I got a lot of cool things coming up. Some collaborations
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:18.600]  and such. I'm going to drop this music down a little more. I did get my email sent to the
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:26.040]  Secret Cup for my company name and all my contact info. So I haven't received anything back yet,
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:31.800]  but it has been sent and Big D sent me a private message on what to send and where. So I better get
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:39.160]  a crop going because it's going to be soon. We have to do it at the end of July, I think,
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:46.200]  because the competition is the first week of August, I believe. So it has to be dried and
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:51.240]  ready to go by then. All right. We'll talk about that. Remind me that after the show. We'll talk
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:58.040]  about that. Seriously. It is time to think about that. The Secret Cup. You told me right after 420
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:03.000]  if we hadn't talked about it to let you know. So now is the time. I just put in my notice.
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:09.960]  Put in notice. Hey, grower, get some shit together. I think we're well on the right path.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.840]  So, yeah, that was not planned at all. Shout out to the whole Secret Cup community. Big D.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:19.720]  Is it Jeremy that helps put it together? Is that the name? Jeremy Norrie. Yeah. Shout out to that
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:25.480]  guy. He's the rig rags, dude. That's an excellent event. Oh, he was also on another podcast I
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.840]  listened to recently. So shout out to that guy. Cool. Yeah. He's a really nice guy. No, he's a
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.000]  cool dude. He seems to be knowledgeable. Yeah. And Big D, of course. Yeah, for sure. One of the
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.880]  leaders in the industry. Yeah. So I'm going to turn this music down just a little bit more just
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:42.200]  because it feels too loud to talk over. It won't go down much more without muting it out. But there
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:49.320]  we go. All right. So how are you, bro? I'm good, man. Busy, like just like you. I've been working
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:55.000]  the hell out of the shop and getting stopped and asked all kinds of questions all the time.
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.720]  So it's been are you calming down or are you picking up? We've been picking up and we've been
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:04.760]  doing summer is bringing in busier days. So are you getting more locals or are you getting more
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:12.040]  like out of towners? It seems to still be about the same ratio. A lot of our customers are out
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:16.840]  of towners. It's kind of amazing. A lot of the guys are out of towners. Well, most of the local
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:21.240]  people that come in and buy weed, they already have their cards and shit. So that's most of our
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:27.400]  medical side is our local people. And then the wreck gets a lot of out of state.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:33.400]  You shared some jelly bean with me from the other day. That stuff was tasty. I forgot to get you
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:38.200]  some. I'll pick some up for you. That's how things go before it's gone. Yeah, exactly. No worries. I
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:43.240]  got busy and we've got some slabs here. Shout out to Turpex Jordan from Turpex. I got to hang out
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.320]  with Jordan and also the Grammy Gatsby. But I got to hang out with Jordan the other day and he threw
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.640]  me down some OG dabs. There's just a couple of dabs of it. It didn't last long. Dude, those dabs
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:57.480]  were great. If you listen to the show, Turpex at Turpex 215. Jordan's a cool dude. He's got other
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:02.520]  dudes, but Jordan's the guy I met. That's good hash. Turpex, good guys. Yeah, Turpex is one of
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:06.520]  my favorite companies for sure. And of course, Hunt. Dude, thanks for letting me kick it on your
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:12.840]  couch. That was pretty fun. We won't even elaborate there. Yeah, I took dabs with your dad, bro. Not
[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:16.840]  really. It was kind of a joke. I showed up and Hunt was dressed in business attire. I told him he
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:21.400]  looked like a substitute teacher because I had my dreadlocks swinging around. I was in happy hippie
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:24.760]  in the sunshine mode and he looked like he was Babylon there to give me a drug test or something.
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.560]  But shout out, bro. Shout out. He changed clothes and we got down to some dabs. Yeah, he's a cool
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:34.280]  guy. Cool. We got a bunch of news I kind of wanted to bring to the table. I've got a lot of topics.
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:41.240]  Kevin and I used to, I don't want to say too much, we used to hang out, kind of contribute a little
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:47.480]  bit, sponsor, I guess, a dab party at a local hookah bar, the Cloud Nine Hookah Bar on 4th and
[02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:54.040]  Santa Fe. I think the address is actually 420 South Santa Fe. 419. 419. Okay, I knew it was close.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:59.720]  Close. Okay, but that's the point is, and I'm going to read a Facebook post that they post and
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:04.120]  we'll just get right to the point. I regret to inform our club members that all cannabis events
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:08.280]  in the city of Pueblo have been canceled by the Pueblo Police Department under threat of revoking
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:13.080]  business licenses. Consumption of cannabis in a private setting is legal according to the
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.600]  Amendment 64 Task Force Regulation of MMJ and recreational cannabis. However, we apologize for
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:23.480]  this injustice and are administratively working to bring you a safe place to consume cannabis.
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:30.120]  However, as of today, April 26, 2014, all cannabis events canceled by Pueblo Police Department under
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:34.920]  under threat to shut down the club permanently. For additional information, there's a phone number
[02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:41.160]  and then they say we shall overcome. If you want to support this or something, it's Cloud Nine Hookah,
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:46.440]  H-O-O-K-A-H. Check that out. They're the one in Pueblo, Colorado. That's where Kevin and I rep.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:51.160]  We're from Pueblo, Colorado. Much love. If you want something, if you want to help out, if you have
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:54.200]  some legal advice or some guidance, or if you just want to chime in on their page and show some
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:58.760]  support, go to Cloud Nine Hookah and let them know that you support them because it's kind of crap.
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:02.760]  Yeah, I definitely had a lot of customers that came into our shop because we were helping
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:08.840]  promote the last event that unfortunately got canceled. But we had a lot of people come in that
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:13.720]  night for the event and were really bummed that they couldn't go and partake because most of the
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:19.400]  people were from out of state that recently have moved to the area. And so they're trying to meet
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:24.440]  new people and meet like-minded people. And it was people of all different types and ages and
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:30.360]  everything, just like every other cannabis event. We had everybody. It was packed on that Saturday
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:36.120]  with people just coming in to get their herb before going down there. And then they were just
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:42.920]  bummed to hear that all day. It was really unfortunate. So they're backing it 100% as well.
[02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:47.400]  We got a lot of customers that are trying to help out with the movement too. So if any of you guys
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:52.840]  are listening to it, that's the Facebook page that you can go and show some support. And you can write
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:23:00.200]  City Council, send them a well-written, thought-out response and letter. Like don't just write
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:05.960]  chicken scratch. Type it. Use a printer. Use spell check. Spell check, grammar check, all that.
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.000]  And show support. I've met several of our friends there. People that we hang out with now.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:17.800]  Yeah, exactly. And I have actually met a couple of people that I knew already on Facebook that I
[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:21.400]  wanted to hang out with. I told them, come down to this place and meet me because it's a chill spot.
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:24.440]  And I don't have to bring new people to my house. I don't have to go to their house. And that place
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:32.760]  is cool. So we met and just Manny, Adam, and Gary. All three I met at that spot on different occasions.
[02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:37.080]  And now that was such huge networking. We're just friends now. I got my job through that place.
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:43.640]  See? Like the manager of the place went down there for one of our events and invited me to come meet
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:49.640]  the owner and start working. I hadn't had a job for almost a year. What we used to be able to do
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:52.840]  here, just to kind of give you some background, I guess, like she should rewind a little.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:57.080]  There's this hookah bar. They're still open. You can still go in there. You can get your hookah.
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:00.920]  I think they have a pool table and they watch movies in there. You can still go get your hookah
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:05.160]  on. You just can't consume cannabis at all in there now. So what we would do, they would host
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:09.560]  private parties and you had to pay a cover charge to get in. You had to show your ID. And once you
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:15.400]  did that, they would offer hash like in the form of dabs, which would be either wax or shatter.
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:20.680]  And then I would always be there with some flowers and shatter. And I would just be rolling up fat
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:27.080]  joints and packing bong loads and then giving people dabs. And the club provided rigs and
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:31.000]  torches and we brought our own rigs and torches. So it was kind of cool. We'd all go hang out
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.720]  and just dab out. They served, they sold like bottled beverages like Mountain Dew and Coke
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:41.720]  and whatnot. And they would order pizza sometimes if there were enough people and sell the pizza at
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:47.080]  a fair price. And so there was nothing wrong going on. The cops came in one night and walked through
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.840]  and I was the first person, like as you walk in the door, I'm the first person you see in that.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.560]  I remember that night, dude. And they looked at me and they kind of grinned like stupid hippie,
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.440]  taking dabs. They weren't offended. They weren't afraid. No, they went and talked to the owner
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:05.800]  for a quick second and then left. And that was it. And that was just their normal like walkthrough
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.800]  like they do at a bar or anything else. They just walked. They didn't check anybody's ID.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.240]  They didn't harass anybody. They didn't talk to anybody other than the owners. And they were fine.
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.720]  There was nothing wrong going on in that place at all. And so, and that's what I'm getting at is
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:25.560]  there were never any fights. The most dramatic shit that happened in there was our friend Wade's
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:30.120]  a comedian and he was Wade. That's like the most dramatic thing I've ever seen in that place.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:34.600]  Like Wade got obnoxiously loud, but it wasn't like violently loud. It's like, dude, we're high.
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.200]  Turn down your volume loud. That was like the worst thing that's ever happened. Sorry, Wade.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:42.440]  I'm just picking on you, bro. I love you. But like really nothing ever went wrong in there. There
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:47.720]  were actually people as I walked in one night that tried to ask me to sell them weed. And I told them
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.080]  to get the fuck out because they were going to ruin a good time. I told him, come on in. I'll get
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:55.080]  you high as shit, but you can't stand out here and buy weed. I told him, get the fuck out of here or
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:01.240]  come on in because that will ruin our good time. Definitely. So nothing went wrong here. Nothing's
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.440]  going wrong. While at the same time, there's seven bars within a walking distance of this hookah bar
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:12.760]  that there are fights at on a regular basis. There's drunk people driving home, which of course
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:18.040]  we were probably going to be dead than attempting to drive home. But it just seems weird that we
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:21.720]  can't hang out and smoke a little cannabis in a private hookah bar setting. And it's the same
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.200]  shit that we ran into, are running into in Denver. This is why the secret cup, the hash event.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.200]  Is being moved. Yeah. Yeah. It's often like we're not even going to say where, but it has been moved
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:36.200]  to a secluded location. It'll be much smaller. Makes it better and makes it worse. It's now we
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.480]  have to limit the vending. We have to limit attendance and that makes it less inviting to
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:47.480]  people, but it makes it more prestigious. So it's kind of cool too. All right. I think it's just
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:52.920]  bullshit that we can't have a nice little smoking spot here in Pueblo or anywhere, anywhere in
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:27:00.280]  Colorado where it's legal. There are places that I know they do puff and I don't want to call them
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.120]  out now since they're shutting down places. But if they're doing that, be careful, you guys,
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:08.120]  keep them going strong, support those places and also tweet me where they are. And we'll,
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:12.120]  Kevin and I will get in the car and we'll go do a little tour of these spots whenever we have a
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.160]  little bit of time. Hit me up at, at I grow culture or at Rasta Jeff 420 on Twitter. I'm
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:22.760]  serious. And we'll come check out your little smoke spots. I owe that to all of them. Kevin
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:28.440]  will come with me. I'm down. We'll bring some killer shatter. Yeah. The fire shatter. The fire.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:33.960]  And if you have, yeah, yeah. If you, uh, all right, cool. I'm gonna move on. Moving on.
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.080]  I sound echoey. Do I sound echoey? Oh, it's cause we got the reggae in the background.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.480]  It's moving on. I'm all dubbed out boy. Shout out once again to Nicky T. Thanks for giving me
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:45.320]  full permission to play this CD. It's cushioned coconut water. It's a little bit old, but man,
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:52.680]  it's still relevant. It still gets going. Music is always relevant, right? Well, good music is
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:59.560]  always relevant. Some of that stuff that the MTV tries to feed you is irrelevant. Like immediately.
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:05.000]  All right. Here's something I thought was cool somewhere where they do invite cannabis
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:11.480]  in a statement Tuesday. And this comes from, it just says the associated press. It doesn't really
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:17.480]  have a, a good author listed. So in a statement Tuesday, symphony CEO, Jerome Kern says they're
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:22.600]  part of efforts to reach a broader audience. The States. I'm going to read that again in a
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:27.240]  statement Tuesday symphony CEO, Jerome Kern says they're part of efforts. Okay. That's where I
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:31.640]  fucked up. They are part of efforts to reach a broader audience. The States only full-time
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:35.960]  professional orchestra like others has struggled with dwindling audiences and budget problems.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:42.520]  So solution listeners are encouraged to bring their own marijuana to smoke or eat to the symphony.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:48.440]  Smoking will be allowed at the private venues where the first two 21 up, 21 and up concerts
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:53.000]  will be held. Organizers say they will follow the rules at the final show and the publicly
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:58.840]  owned Red Rocks amphitheater where smoking is officially banned. I got a couple of things to
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:04.040]  say there, but the last sentence where smoking is officially banned at Red Rocks, didn't we just have
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:09.160]  Snoop and Wiz Khalifa there and Mac Miller and Slightly Stupid there. That was pretty smoked up.
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:16.120]  Those lights were cloudy. Yeah. Dude, you could smoke the fuck out at Red Rocks. They have stopped
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:20.520]  giving a shit. I remember a few years ago I walked in and I had a bubbler tucked into my waistband
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:23.960]  like it was a gun because I had nowhere else to put it. And I figured I could distract him with
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.840]  my hands and all my movement, my Wookiee type skills. And so I was cool. He let me through,
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:33.000]  but then the wind blew and it highlighted like it wrapped my shirt up on my body real quick
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.440]  and showed my bubbler and he goes, what is that? And I go, that's my bubbler. And he goes,
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:41.400]  you're what? And I go, my bubbler. And he looked at me and he felt embarrassed that he missed it.
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:45.160]  And he goes, just get out of my line and let me go through. Yeah. He didn't want to like,
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.520]  cause he already let me through. His boss would have saw him pull that shit out after I already
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:53.080]  passed security. So he would have been in trouble. But so in an attempt to get more people to come to
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:58.120]  the symphony, these guys are inviting you to bring some ganja to come spark up at the symphony.
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.720]  I like symphonies, bro. Yeah. Are you a symphony kind of guy? Dude, the one I went to was so
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:11.880]  awesome. What'd you go see? Uh, Beethoven's fifth up in Denver, Colorado symphony orchestra. Okay.
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:16.920]  It was freaking intense. I was like the only hippie looking kid in there. Like there's all
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:23.080]  these like rich people in Texas and like furs and fucking super blinged out jewelry, like all these
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:29.960]  old ladies and shit. And fuck dude, it's, it's ridiculous. I was sitting there all stoned as
[02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:35.800]  like I stood out like a sore thumb dude. It's the only person not dressed up like us that night in
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:41.560]  that restaurant. Yeah. So they need to, uh, they need to make more events like this. Why can,
[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:46.280]  yeah. Why can we go smoke at the symphony, but not at the hookah bar? The hookah bar has couches,
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:52.840]  the hookah bar has snacks and the hookah bar plays reggae. If I ask them to, I don't understand
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:31:00.440]  the, the point either, but I do like that I can fucking blaze out at some symphonies. Yeah. Those
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:05.400]  things are going to sell the fuck out, dude. Right. They should just let us smoke at every concert and
[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:09.320]  not worry because that's part of the musical experience. We've wanted, people have been
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:15.000]  enhancing musical experiences. Everybody does at every show. So it's not like, oh man, I remember
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:22.280]  when I used to go see Fish one night and it was, uh, the date was eight, five 96 and Fish opened
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:29.720]  up set two with a space odyssey, 2001 into Haley's Comet into down with disease into it's ice. I'm
[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:35.080]  pretty sure that's the order. Uh, during that little section of music there at some point,
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:39.240]  Red Rocks lifted up and spun around and did a bunch of circles and changed colors. And then
[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:44.840]  it landed perfectly back in place. Uh, and that would not have happened without a little bit of
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:51.480]  concert enhancement. So that's the kind of shit that's like part of what you go for. That's part
[02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:57.240]  of, yeah, that's part of the experience. All right. So let us smoke at concerts. That's all we're
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:01.160]  saying. Uh, let us smoke everywhere. I'm going to take a sip real quick. I got some truck mouth
[02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:05.560]  happening. Can I get one of those waters, bro? There you go, bro. That's actually what it was
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:08.760]  there for. I just wasn't paying attention. I like to set it right out of reach of the guest.
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:12.120]  So you get real thirsty and you have that, like, I can fucking see the water. They're
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:16.600]  like, don't buy the headphones. I don't. I can't. Does that, is that mine or is that cause it's just,
[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:27.680]  yeah, that was on purpose. Not really. How about that? Reggae air horn right at the drink break
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:34.240]  pool up. Seriously. Thanks Niko for letting me play your stuff. Please listen to one podcast.
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:37.760]  Make it, make sure it's this episode. I'm going to skip this part. We're going to move on to
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:42.720]  another news section here. I got a couple more. I want to make sure I get them all in
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:48.320]  because I got a lot of stuff going on. I got a lot of news. There's a lot of news. Sometimes I
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:52.160]  have a hard time selecting news stories. I can't find enough news. And then sometimes since I didn't
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:57.840]  do much news on the last show with all the boys, I had a lot of news saved up. So, uh,
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:04.240]  where'd I put my pens? I bet they're down here. I don't have any pens in my reach.
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:11.920]  All right. Uh, May 1st was, uh, the day that mandatory testing for edibles begins in Colorado.
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:15.920]  And the story is coming from the cannabis. It was originally written by Eric Gorski from the
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:23.920]  Denver post. Sorry, I'm clearing my throat here. So for the first time makers of marijuana infused
[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:28.480]  cookies, cupcakes, and candies were required to submit samples to newly licensed independent
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:31.600]  labs for testing starting Thursday, which was May 1st.
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:37.360]  If an individual individually packaged product exceeds the legal limit of 100 milligrams of THC,
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.600]  marijuana's major psychoactive ingredient, it is supposed to be blocked from reaching
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:46.480]  recreational store shelves. Manufacturers can fix the problem or destroy the batch,
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:50.320]  or you can donate them to the agriculture podcast and we'll make sure that they are
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:57.280]  disposed of properly. That is definitely an acceptable option. Feel free to send all of your
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:03.360]  overly medicated edibles right this way. I will, uh, I will dispose of them. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:09.280]  They will work safely. I'm a professional. I know how to dispose of edibles the proper way.
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:16.080]  Oh, don't refresh please. Uh, so my, uh, this, I may be right now. The, uh, we're at the internet's
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:20.160]  down here in my neighborhood and the page just refreshed, but we've got good news. It came back.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:27.200]  By the way, uh, follow me on Twitter. I'm at the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:34.160]  the fuck you Comcast. Please get my cable and internet fixed because it's going to be a long night without any internet trying to do
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:41.600]  podcasts and post podcasts and all that good shit. All right. I'm way off task here. Okay. So send me
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:46.000]  all of your edibles that are overdosed. Now the debut of mandatory potency testing for edibles
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.960]  did not come without problems. Only two labs were cleared to start testing Thursday. And even those
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.960]  haven't yet been fully certified. The state postponed another test that was supposed to
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:59.920]  begin and edible manufacturers are concerned about a lack of standardization and results
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:05.520]  are all over the map. State officials acknowledged testing will not be perfect at the start.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:14.720]  So the labs that are testing aren't tested yet. So how can any of the testing be valid? But anyway,
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:20.400]  for us, it goes back to public safety said Lewis Cod caused key. Sorry, dude, I just fucked up.
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:24.320]  Your name said Lewis Kosky director of the marijuana enforcement division, part of the
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:28.640]  department of revenue. And we'll talk about that in a second. I'm gonna hold my head up in the air
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.760]  to remember to review that it's a necessary step for us to ensure that the product is what it says
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.400]  it is on the label. The marijuana enforcement division, I've talked about those guys before,
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:42.880]  that is basically what it sounds like the marijuana enforcement division, they go to your
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:50.640]  to the dispensaries, and they have access to everything. They also go to like private homes
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:56.240]  and shit to have people who have badges if they suspect you're doing something wrong. Oh, wow. Yeah,
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.760]  I didn't know. They also show up with like local cops and shit. That's pretty neat. And if you're
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:11.040]  doing anything illegal, we might want to tell a couple of our friends that so just so you know,
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:14.880]  yeah, so check it out. What Kevin just said is if you're in Colorado, and if you have,
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:22.160]  if you are a badged medical marijuana and for an MED badged employee, the MED can bring local
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.160]  police to your house and come to your house and investigate to see if you were conducting any sort
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:33.360]  of illegal activity. Think about that you guys that a lot of you guys. That's gives a lot of
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:36.880]  you guys some shit to think about. Because a lot of us are private caregivers. And a lot of those
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:42.640]  guys are also going to have a home grow. Yeah. Is that gonna so but we're legit, right? They can
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.120]  have their home grow just as long as they're not if they're within their limits or whatever. Yeah,
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:50.640]  on the side or beating their wife on the side or having a bunch of guns or some shit as long as
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:56.240]  they're not committing a crime. illegal guns. Right. All right. That's weird. I guess that's
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:00.960]  one of the things you sign up for. Yeah, I wonder if a lot of people paid attention to that. That's
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:07.600]  a whole nother show that we should your rights get pretty effed in the a when you apply for badges
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:11.520]  through them. Yeah, so they can come to apparently if you're a badge, a badge employee means that you
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:16.400]  have to apply for a medical marijuana enforcement division employee badge. There are certain levels
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.600]  of badging that are required for different parts of the store or job. You need those to do anything
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:27.920]  dispensary related grow related in a shop that is going to go recreational or medical infused
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:32.960]  products any of that. Yeah, it's all all of it. So the MED or the MED the marijuana and for it used
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.400]  to be the medical marijuana enforcement division. Now it's just the marijuana enforcement division,
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:42.160]  they can go to any dispensary and they can also search the employees vehicles that are in the
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:47.440]  parking lots. They can search the employees pockets if they feel the need. They're they're
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:51.600]  the weed Nazis. They're the ones in charge of all of it. So it's not just the wild wild west out here.
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:58.640]  A couple few years ago under we're under strict regulation between 10 and eight years ago. It was
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:07.200]  the wild wild west around 2007 like 2010 ish. I think it was nuts around here. You there was no
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:13.280]  enforcement division. You would open up a dispensary and home growers or caregivers would bring their
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.840]  products to the shop and offer you do you want to buy this pound of weed and you buy that pound of
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:22.960]  weed and put it on your shelf like it was no thing. All you needed was a red card. We didn't give a
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:27.520]  back in those days. I miss that time. Over regulation is making things weird.
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:33.680]  So I'm going to continue the article a new the new testing comes amid growing scrutiny of the
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.920]  edible marijuana products with two recent deaths linked to edibles hospital emergency rooms
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:43.200]  reporting more patients reacting badly to edibles and state legislators and regulators. Now I never
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:46.640]  mentioned the two deaths on my show because I don't want to support that propaganda is honestly
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.440]  why I never talked about it very much in depth. I think we mentioned the one kid jumping one time.
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:55.760]  I don't want to support that. I don't want to be attached to it. I don't want to touch it. I don't
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:01.120]  know enough about it. I don't know what that kid was on. So I avoided it. Sorry if you felt like I
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:06.800]  should have talked about it. Enforcement division officials say even testing labs have been licensed
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:11.120]  and for being certified an additional step carried out with State Department of Public Health and
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:16.880]  Environment to be certified labs must meet standards that include lab director qualifications
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:22.640]  quality control security and sample tracking. As of Thursday however none had completed the
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:28.480]  process state officials said. Two labs received provisional certifications meaning they're in
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:32.560]  material compliance but not through the process. There's a little fly buzzing around me I'm trying
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:35.200]  to smack it and I'm hitting everything but the fly. That's fucking funny.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:42.800]  Uh where did I go? Okay state officials I indefinitely postponed mandatory mandatory
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.840]  testing that was to begin Thursday for homogeneity basically making sure THC is
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:53.600]  spread throughout a product and not concentrated in any area. A spokeswoman said the division wants
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:59.680]  to take one step at a time to ensure a controlled rollout process for testing. So they're not just
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.600]  gonna slap everybody with huge problems if they do come out kind of wrong because they understand
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:09.440]  the lab could be fucked up too. They understand that we have to do this slowly just like the
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:14.800]  cannabis industry worked a lot better when it grew slowly I believe and now we're in this big
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:19.600]  giant cannabis bubble and it's gonna pop somehow because there are a million fucking vape pen
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:26.080]  companies. Yeah. There are a million edible companies and so I like her idea of a controlled
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.080]  rollout process. Yeah. Like that's what we do in the cannabis industry. It's how we do it. You
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:36.320]  don't go large scale right away because it costs a lot of money and we're all grassroots companies
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:40.640]  not crap but you know what I mean. Yeah. Now that grassroots use that name they fucking get a lot
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:46.080]  of promotion and also that's something we talked about on another episode the THC being spread
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.880]  through a product and not concentrated in any area. Like if your chocolate bar melts and this is
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.520]  relative to another topic I've got coming up if your chocolate bar melts and is tipped one way
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:59.920]  and then it's re-hardened you may have just re-stirred all of the fucking cannabinoids to
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:05.360]  one area so I understand what they're trying to do and that's good because I've got a patient that
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:09.600]  if I gave him a hundred milligram edible that would be four doses for him if it all got moved
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:16.720]  to one end he'd be really fucked up one time like he'd be bad. So I'll continue. Kosky said earlier
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.440]  this week he was confident labs could handle potency testing for the roughly 40 Colorado
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:27.360]  businesses making edible products for recreational use. So the company has to make them or test them
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:31.840]  not or the company has to front the testing not the dispensaries which is kind of cool.
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:38.800]  I think if the dispensary were required to do it the cost would land on the patients a little more
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:42.480]  yeah since the company is doing it they're gonna take they can take the hit a little better
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:47.600]  but among labs and edible companies there was uncertainty there always is that's how our
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:53.520]  industry thrives is in uncertainty. I think everybody is probably in the same situation as me
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.400]  hanging back waiting to pull the trigger on adding instrumentation or personnel said Joseph Evans
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:03.040]  Laboratory Director of Steep Hill Halent which says it got the green light to begin the mandatory
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:10.080]  testing. Shout out to the guys at Steep Hill Halent labs, Earl Ripper, at Grimey Gatsby that's
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.200]  Addison Demora, John Hunt much love you guys. Those are some cool guys I really and Joseph Evans also
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:19.920]  I had to pull myself away from a conversation with Joseph where I would have been there
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.760]  for like I would have camped just to talk to that guy I would have just sat down on the table bring
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:28.720]  a lunch I could talk to him all day one day I'll get the opportunity you know when we talk to
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:34.880]  Addison he sounds like he knows everything about dabs he learned it all from Joe yeah I feel like
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:39.360]  not just Joe but like Joe knows 20 times that and our buddy that sits at the table and teaches us
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:44.240]  about chemistry Joe would school him yeah and no offense to either of those guys but Joe is
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:49.680]  fucking brilliant Joe entertains my mind I like it so shout out big guy I'd like to talk to that
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:56.240]  dude too next time we go up they are at the table willing to talk all we have to do is show up at
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:01.680]  the labs if you call Steep Hill labs and tell them you need some information they will they'll do
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:04.720]  some consulting for you they may charge you a little bit but you can go up there and get some
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:08.960]  consulting done sit at the table really cool yeah I've paid my upfront consulting fee for a minute
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:15.760]  so got that account going so some edible companies fear a backlog can the labs handle the volume in
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:21.360]  a timely fashion said Joe Hodes spokesman for Dixie Elixirs and Edibles of Denver Dixie Elixirs
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:27.520]  is hard to say when you're dabbed the fuck out by the way so if it was a 24 or 48 hour turnaround
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:33.760]  for voluntary testing becomes two-week turnaround that significantly impacts our production I fucked
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.160]  up that sentence but you got the point Hodes said because of inconsistent results in Colorado's lab
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:44.640]  testing industry Dixie has is moving to lower the dosage in its 100 milligram products to reduce the
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:50.240]  risk of failing a test so instead of trying to get the test right you're just gonna fucking lowball
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.520]  yourself edible makers say samples from each batch get widely different results from different labs
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:59.840]  Meg Collins executive director of the Cannabis Business Alliance said the consistency problem
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.800]  can be addressed with data the state collects for mandatory testing it's important for the state to
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:08.960]  begin the program and not delay it she said if there are wrinkles they can be worked out
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:16.880]  go slow that's what I recommend so Dan Alge- Anglin? Dan Anglin of Edipure which infuses food
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:22.240]  products with THC disagrees he supports a delay in mandatory testing if a company relies on a
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:26.800]  test result that underestimates the true level of THC companies could end up putting too much he said
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:31.840]  very good point then we're right back where we are overdosing people this is a result of trying
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:36.720]  to rush something to appease public opinion and what it's actually doing is putting harmful public
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:42.560]  policy in place he said the state said is working to contract with the reference lab a sort of
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:46.480]  independent check on the process that would be used to verify the results and practices of labs
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:54.480]  conducting the tests so they want to hire a lab to test the labs that are testing the products
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:45:02.720]  so we're gonna have to hire a lab to test that lab too right? I would assume which makes sense but
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:06.480]  man this is what happens when you freaking over-regulate shit yeah because guess who's
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:12.000]  paying for it the patients and the customers they end up definitely yeah so there's another
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.760]  dollar on every product that you buy one more dollar for all these tests maybe maybe $1.25
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:21.600]  that doesn't sound like a lot but if you're an MMJ patient and you're already struggling because
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:27.920]  your wife is rough in Colorado or in the world you're gonna be fucking broke so Dr. Michael
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:32.640]  Wimp, Director of Medical Chemistry Core Facility at the University of Colorado School of Pharmacy
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:38.640]  and Pharmaceutical Sciences I'm so glad that it's not my fucking title. Could you imagine having to
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:42.720]  write that or introduce yourself that hi I'm Dr. Michael Wimp, Director of the Medical Chemistry
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:47.280]  Core Facility at the University of Colorado School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:52.400]  that dude said it should that should have come first it's extremely important he said how can
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.880]  you release a product to people and not know whether the label is correct and this is the only
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:02.480]  industry that would get away with that also yeah is doing that so uh Senior Enforcement Director of
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:06.160]  the Marijuana Enforcement Division acknowledged that a system without a reference lab is not
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.280]  perfect but mandatory testing and regimented testing of the product is better than no testing
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:16.080]  at all he said other testing of recreational marijuana will be introduced in coming months
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:23.600]  including screening for contaminants that's the part I look forward to so basically uh they're
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:27.680]  trying to roll out this thing on the first of the year everybody's got to get compliant and
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:32.080]  everybody but the labs and the system that they put in place so that's how the MMED works
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:37.440]  sometimes hurry up and wait hurry up and wait what I liked is they said that stuff's coming up
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:42.080]  uh that all of the cannabis will be tested in the future all of the hash will be tested in the future
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:47.520]  it will be tested for potency and will also be tested for contaminants like contaminants will be
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:53.360]  bugs mold and I'm hoping that they implement the new stuff that Steep Hill is using and they are
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:47:00.960]  looking for pesticides the guys at Steep Hill told me that they're able to find pesticides so if
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:06.720]  you spray your plants when they are baby clones little tiny clones in cups you let them grow for
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:10.960]  two or three weeks four weeks you flower them for nine weeks you let them dry you trim them you
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:16.160]  harvest them even if they're flushed properly and taken care of the kids it's the professors
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:23.040]  the scientists the chemists at Steep Hill labs can find those pesticides that you sprayed in your buds
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:28.480]  in your flowers they can definitely find it in hash they said it's way more prevalent in hash
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:33.520]  because you're concentrating everything yeah we're gonna be finding a lot of great and a lot of
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:38.480]  terrible shit here in the very near future I'm looking to see how much music we have on the CD
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:44.880]  we might run out of nicotine music oh shit we got like 40 songs on this disc we ain't got no trouble
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:52.640]  shout out Nika thanks for letting me play your CD bro all right so another story connected to
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:59.040]  our edible report tens of thousands in product thrown away after pot shop health inspections
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:07.040]  uh this is by Boris Sanchez from Fox 31 Denver hopefully we don't get a pop-up all right uh
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.480]  Thoi Vu I think that's how you say it the guy's name is Thoi Vu a public Denver health inspector
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:17.360]  Denver public health inspector is changing the edible marijuana business in Denver not only does
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.640]  she go oops I said he huh not only does she go I think I called that person a guy earlier not only
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:27.840]  does she go into local restaurants to make sure their food is up to par she now also inspects the
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:31.920]  edibles at recreational marijuana dispensaries and the kitchens where they are made we don't
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:36.960]  really look at it as an infused product we look at it as food said Vu who along with her team of
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.360]  health inspectors has been making unannounced visits to metro area marijuana businesses since
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:48.320]  January 1st the focus is to look closely at edibles manufacturing process from stem to snack
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:53.120]  how they are cultivating the plants asking them about different fertilizers fertilizers pesticides
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.680]  and what they're using said Vu at most dispensaries her goal is to look at whether or not edibles are
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:02.880]  being stored properly her team has had to establish new regulations for how edible products should be
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:08.800]  kept based off based off federal rules that already apply to non-similar cannabis infused products
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:14.160]  yeah have you ever gotten a edible at a dispensary dude that you could tell it has
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.640]  full-on been melted and like they threw it in the freezer to fix it like yeah yeah so they're
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.480]  gonna try to stop that because that's messing with your health that could be dangerous I'm
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:29.440]  gonna read right after this drink give me a sip time here we go sip time it's like a time out
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:36.880]  drink time out lots of dabs and talking man you need some water all right according to records
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:40.560]  obtained from the department of health new rules have forced dispensary owners no I said that huh
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:46.000]  uh dispensary owners dump out a lot of product including hundreds of boxes of edibles costing
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:52.800]  manufacturers and dispensaries tens of thousands of dollars man so these guys had to dump out tens
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:59.440]  of thousands of dollars the most prominent prominent example hash infused oils Vu says
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:04.720]  that oil products not being refrigerated when they should be adding that to keep adding that
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.280]  to keep products from growing bacteria we'd like them to ensure that it's being held at 41 degrees
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:14.720]  fahrenheit or below so all you guys that are making edibles and having edibles why don't you do this
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:18.880]  for us to keep it at 41 degrees fahrenheit or below when you're storing it and that'll prevent
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:23.040]  any bacteria from growing that'll do us all a favor and then you won't get any trouble for
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:29.600]  making anybody sick so one metro area hash oil manufacturer who did not want to be identified
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:34.400]  is not too thrilled about the new rules it doesn't make sense said the manufacturer who had to recall
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:39.120]  several of her products and dispose of more than five thousand dollars worth of edibles though she
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:43.760]  says no one had ever become sick using her products i've personally never seen a bottle of
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:48.960]  olive oil sitting in a refrigerator so to me it doesn't make any sense at all she said in response
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:54.560]  thoi thoi says that most other oils sold at grocery stores undergo a rigorous inspection process by
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:59.680]  the FDA which even the oil manufacturer admits would not happen with their products when it's
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:04.080]  infused product there's no laboratories that would touch anything of that sort she said adding that
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:08.320]  while the recalls are frustrating she believes thoi and her team are doing the best they can
[02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:13.600]  surprisingly with this industry they are extremely compliant they want to ensure that whatever product
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:19.280]  they are producing is safe so they are kind of making sure that there's quality control now it's
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:24.320]  not the wild wild west like we talked about a minute ago oh don't do that to me we might have
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:31.680]  lost one story i think i had it what was the next one that one article disappeared so we're not going
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:37.520]  to get to read too much about that maybe i can get back to it which one was it uh so the denver post
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:41.840]  is receiving a lot of questions about oh it's going to reload we may have internet service back
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:48.160]  here again uh the denver post posted an article about a common a colorado marijuana guide 64
[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:55.680]  answers to commonly asked questions uh yeah some of them some of the answers i think i've seen did
[02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:59.440]  you read some of the answers yeah some of them are kind of hokey some of them are but some of
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:04.000]  them are actually educational got a few minutes here so we'll read a couple of them before we get
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:09.280]  to uh toe that i just say before we get toe before we get to our uh give thanks portion before we
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:14.560]  read a couple of political rants so here are some uh like i said the denver post
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:21.440]  posted i'm trying to find the author uh john ingold from the denver post this was posted
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:28.160]  oh this is posted oh updated january 3rd so this is kind of old news and i'm just now reading it so
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:33.120]  uh there are a lot of crazy questions here i'm going to skim through them i'll read the opening
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:38.160]  article on january 1st colorado became the first place anywhere in the world to allow legal marijuana
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:43.760]  sales to anybody over 21 for any purpose you have you have questions about how it works here are 64
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:52.720]  answers to commonly asked questions all right so the first question which i've been talking about
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:58.560]  for a long time did marijuana become legal in colorado on january 1st 2014 and we all know that
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:04.080]  marijuana was actually legal in colorado prior to 2014 since the voter approved amendment 64
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:09.680]  went into effect on december 10th 2012 it has been legal for anyone 21 and over to use marijuana or
[02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:15.600]  possess up to an ounce of marijuana for any purpose even if it's just as rolling stone magazine has
[02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:20.400]  put it for getting high purposes marijuana possession and use by people under 21 who
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:25.360]  aren't medical marijuana patients remains against the law so the follow-up question what happened on
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:31.680]  january 1st then new year's day was the first day that marijuana could be sold to anyone over 21 at
[02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:36.480]  specially licensed stores though marijuana use possession and sale remain illegal under federal
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:45.920]  law nowhere else in the world has pot sales this legal not even amsterdam so that was kind of they're
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:50.800]  accurate there i give them props the next question is where can i buy weed uh more than two dozen
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:55.760]  shops open january 1st for recreational sales we here at the denver post have compiled a list of
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:01.440]  stores that opened and if you go to this article in the denver post uh they have a actually have
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:06.640]  a marijuana section so go to that section find this article and there's a link there of dispensaries
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:12.000]  in colorado that are open for recreational use uh my buddy here kev bro he works at a place called
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.480]  the spot in pueblo west they don't pay for any plugs or anything if you want to talk to a kid that
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:21.360]  i know kevin knows a lot of shit about weed because i'd like to toot my own horn and say he
[02:54:21.360 --> 02:54:26.800]  probably learned a good portion of it from me a lot of it and i just found out a lot of the links and
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.840]  where to find out information through you too so yeah so i trust that he knows what he's talking
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:35.920]  about 90 of the way because he learned it from me and our crew and we try to teach each other the
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:41.520]  best and he makes hella good hash so he must be learning all right so if you guys want to buy weed
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:45.520]  the next question is how does it work and the greatest answer you basically walk into a store
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:50.880]  show them your id and make a purchase it's a lot like a liquor store uh there's a lot of
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:56.640]  normal questions uh are there limits on how much i can buy people with a colorado id can buy up to
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:00.800]  an ounce of marijuana at a time people with an out-of-state id can buy up to a quarter ounce at
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:06.000]  a time the next question is there enough pot to go around uh yes i'm not even going to read their
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:11.920]  answer yes we got some weed don't worry can i make multiple multiple purchases on the same day
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:18.480]  yes the only cap how much you can buy uh it's the legal possession limit uh the only cap on how much
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:23.280]  you can buy is the legal possession limit no one who's a non-medical marijuana patient can possess
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:27.440]  more than one ounce at a time but that's up to the customer to abide by there's nothing in the
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:32.960]  state's rules for recreational marijuana stores that requires them to track the purchase so the
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:39.280]  next obvious question is can i go store to store buying weed yes you can uh if you have more than
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:42.960]  an ounce of weed on you you've broken the law at that point so you can go get four good quarters
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:49.040]  and then go home uh smoke seven grams and go buy seven more but if you're a rebel you can do that
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:55.280]  is there a list of marijuana customers that will be given no i already know the answer but i'll
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:59.840]  read it to you no amendment 64 which is a constitutional measure specifically forbids
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:05.280]  the measure states that the department shall not require a consumer to provide a retail marijuana
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.360]  store with personal information other than government issued identification to concern
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:14.160]  to determine the consumer's age and a retail marijuana store shall not be required to acquire
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.960]  and record personal information about consumers other than information typically acquired in a
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:23.680]  financial transaction conducted at a retail liquor store so that means you will not be
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:28.160]  tracked you will not you will be on camera though the next question is there anything that will show
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:32.320]  uh that i bought weed at one of the shops and it says yes you'll be on camera
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:36.160]  uh there's a lot of stuff about the camera uh
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:43.120]  yes you'll be on camera can i smoke in the store no where can i go to consume
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:49.120]  that's a little fuzzy uh they you can't really smoke anywhere in here can i in colorado unless
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:52.560]  you find like a private bar or something i'm not going to read the stuff that they said here
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:56.960]  but there is a colorado's clean air act so pot smoking isn't allowed anywhere that cigarette
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.840]  smoking is also banned so if you can't smoke cigarettes you can't smoke weed there there have
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:08.080]  been exceptions made i'm not going to mention them uh can i puff at a park somewhere absolutely not
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:14.800]  ski slope colorado's winter resorts are not all stoked at the possibility of stone skiers and
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.040]  what's more most of the actual ski slopes are on federal land where marijuana use
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:22.800]  and possession remains strictly for boat in so don't smoke at the ski slopes
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:28.320]  uh so that means taking marijuana on a summer camping trip is probably out too yes
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.440]  national parks national forests national monuments all off limits
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.680]  oh i didn't even think of that what about apartments landlords can say no
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:41.040]  yeah but there are some places if you tell them you're gonna smoke weed there they'll let you
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:45.600]  what about my back patio front porch or balcony different cities a lot of different stuff is kind
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:52.720]  of the answer there so there's a lot of stuff going on i don't want to read all those can i
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:58:02.720]  send weed in the mail kev can i send weed in the mail no no you can't fucking send weed in the
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.880]  fucking mail i won't send you any weed i won't send you any dabs i won't send you any slabs
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:13.040]  send you some dick pics that's all you get don't send weed in the mail colorado's working hard to
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:19.600]  get cheese colorado's working hard and all that shit that leaves here is fucking it up every time
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:23.440]  it gets caught it's fucking it up so i'm not gonna i've ranted about that if you want to yeah don't
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:28.240]  do that is it okay to drive with marijuana in my car the answer is yes as long as you're transporting
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:34.640]  it and not consuming it driving stone is absolutely against the law uh colorado this year made it
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:38.880]  easier to win convictions against stone drivers the state set a standard of how much thc the
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:43.280]  psychoactive chemical and marijuana that drivers can have in their system the driver tests above
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:48.560]  that the prosecutor can tell the jury it's okay to assume the driver was stoned there's a lot more
[02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:53.040]  questions uh will my employer be okay with it um i'm not going to read their part that's up to the
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:59:02.480]  employer probably not um can i legally possess an ounce of marijuana how much is that in practical
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:10.800]  terms it's a lot reachers of circuit so an ounce of marijuana uh 28 grams of uh good dank herb it'll
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:15.520]  fill up like one of those sandwich baggies just about perfectly like because it's fluffy it's not
[02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:21.680]  squished it's about a sandwich bag full how much will it cost is the next question uh in the medical
[02:59:21.680 --> 02:59:27.920]  marijuana market ounces cost from 150 to close to 300 but nobody buys full ounces the more common
[02:59:27.920 --> 02:59:32.880]  purchase amount is an eighth think of it like a 12 pack it's from around 25 to 45 for medical
[02:59:32.880 --> 02:59:37.440]  marijuana we'll have to wait and see what stores set the recreational prices does that include taxes
[02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:46.480]  no um right now i see prices being advertised for rec shops right about 200 to 250 an ounce for good
[02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:50.880]  stuff what do you charge at your shop dude for rec shops that's about medical sorry that's totally
[02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:55.120]  what i mean yeah med shops yeah i don't even walk into a rec shop the only reason i go to a shop is
[02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:59.440]  to get some edibles right i got a monkey bar i ate a monkey bar dude i should mention that from
[02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:04.800]  incredibles shout out incredibles fucking monkey bar dude thing was so delicious as well medicated
[03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:09.920]  one of pop's favorite is the blueberry bliss oh yeah yeah i don't do blueberry but it fits as good
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:13.760]  as the monkey bar he loves it yeah i think they're really good the cookies and cream thing is delicious
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:21.200]  oh my god so on your rec site at your shop what do you guys sell an ounce for uh we're at 460 before
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:34.320]  tax and how much is it on the medical side uh 230 for non-members okay 180 for members
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:38.320]  but half price if you're a medical but we're not really doing ounces right now on medical
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:42.640]  because we're trying to make sure every patient has some meds cool like we're cool you know
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:48.880]  good recreation you can get you can get a half though like you can get a half but we're trying
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:52.720]  to make sure we keep product on our shelves for everybody and we're not like some of these other
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:01:02.400]  dispensaries that don't have anything so there are reasoning for that there are a lot of other
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.600]  stuff yeah there's a ton of questions on there one that i want to go over that i just discovered
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:12.960]  seed to sale tracking how does it work this could be long uh in december the state rolled out its
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:20.160]  1.2 million excuse me 1.2 million dollar marijuana tracking system called mits for uncreatively
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:26.800]  marijuana inventory tracking solution it works a little like this every plant that a commercial
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:31.760]  grower's start sticks in dirt gets a radio frequency tag an rf tag that moves with the
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:35.680]  plant through its life cycle once the marijuana is harvested everything is weighed then it's weighed
[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:41.440]  again after drying out and at other points during processing until it's all packaged up to leave the
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:47.600]  grow so basically uh if you work there and you're trimming you make three piles you have buds you
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:52.160]  have trim and then you have trash and you get a plant you cut it down you do your harvest and all
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:56.560]  of your stuff has to weigh what it weighed when you originally cut it down you have to have enough
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:00.160]  buds enough trim and enough sticks to equal the weight of the original plant or they think you
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:06.160]  just stole some shit or it's missing and it needs to be accounted for so uh it's uh it's weighed
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:10.560]  several times then the package is shipped to stores to stores can't weigh more than a pound
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:15.040]  and they get their own rfid tags at the shop store owners are required to weigh their inventory
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:20.560]  every day all of the data is entered into the mits the mitts stores are also required to have
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:24.960]  some type of point of sale tracking system to chart sales in theory every purchase at point
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:30.080]  of sale system should have a corresponding drop in inventory in the marijuana tracking system
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:34.720]  it's up to the state's pot auditors to actually scour the books and make sure it all matches up
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:53.520]  so the tracking system does not have limits though
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:03:00.080]  which is why officials say it's just an enforcement tool not a whole regime and embarrassingly for the
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:04.640]  state holiday shipping delays mean not all plants in the commercial system were entered into the
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:09.360]  mitts by january 1st that was kind of funny january 1st they're like this is all required
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:13.920]  this is all required i was watching dispensary owner sit there going well unless ups comes today
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:20.320]  that shit ain't happening it's kind of funny so there's a lot of stuff i don't want to read i want
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:24.480]  to open my own marijuana store where do i start i'm not even going to get into that one dude that's
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:29.680]  long all right i got add on this article so i'm glad i got to share that one a little bit with you
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:35.600]  i'm gonna move on to the next topic here uh i mentioned at the start of the show that we
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:44.880]  defeated senate bill 177 and 178 yeah uh i tweeted a lot i didn't uh i didn't do as much as i could
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:49.200]  but a lot of people sent emails a lot of people rallied we got a lot of support that's really cool
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:55.760]  proud of us for that uh we need to knock that down so now uh there's a new one we are looking
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:02.000]  for volunteers to send a few emails urging members of the senate to vote yes vote yes on senate bill
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:11.120]  218 218 with its passage colorado can begin the process of lifting up those that have been so
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:16.080]  adversely affected by the collateral punishment associated with criminal criminal convictions of
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:21.760]  marijuana i have a template and a contact list i'm happy to share with you so what this will do
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:28.240]  this will possibly start to uh free marijuana prisoners people that are in jail for weed crimes
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:33.200]  yep yeah and take some convictions off of some people's records who have already served their
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:39.680]  time and stuff there you go that's awesome too yes or yeah if you were or if you have a weed crime and
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:45.520]  that'll go away now in colorado if you do the right take the right steps so uh i will post i
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:50.800]  will get those email addresses by the time this episode posts and i will post those up and we can
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:05:00.000]  vote yes on sb 218 big shout out to my buddy kevin mamalji who helps me uh find all these senate
