[00:01.790 --> 00:04.130]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:04.130 --> 00:05.970]  It's time for episode 337
[00:05.970 --> 00:07.610]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.610 --> 00:11.210]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:11.210 --> 00:13.410]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:13.410 --> 00:15.730]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:15.730 --> 00:16.970]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:16.970 --> 00:18.330]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:18.330 --> 00:20.070]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:20.070 --> 00:22.550]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:22.550 --> 00:24.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, put some fresh water in the bong
[00:24.970 --> 00:27.910]  because it's time for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.910 --> 00:29.130]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:29.130 --> 00:31.010]  It's time for episode 337.
[00:31.010 --> 00:32.450]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:32.450 --> 00:34.810]  As always, this episode of the podcast is brought to you
[00:34.810 --> 00:36.810]  by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:36.810 --> 00:38.530]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[00:38.530 --> 00:40.930]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[00:40.930 --> 00:45.010]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:45.010 --> 00:46.970]  All right, that's all the advertising for this episode.
[00:46.970 --> 00:48.390]  You guys know I like to start the show off
[00:48.390 --> 00:50.450]  by telling you what I've been smoking on.
[00:50.450 --> 00:53.970]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Guava Papaya Nectar
[00:53.970 --> 00:55.410]  from Green Dot Labs.
[00:55.410 --> 00:58.450]  This is Chem-4 and papaya mixed together.
[00:58.450 --> 01:02.610]  It is labeled as sour fuel and soft fruit flavors.
[01:02.610 --> 01:06.210]  It's got sort of a sour fuel and then there's a weird,
[01:06.210 --> 01:08.810]  like a green gummy bear or a green gummy worm
[01:08.810 --> 01:10.090]  sort of a flavor to it.
[01:10.090 --> 01:10.930]  I was enjoying it.
[01:10.930 --> 01:12.930]  It's got a nice ripping head high to it.
[01:12.930 --> 01:14.530]  It's got me kind of slowed down, it feels like.
[01:14.530 --> 01:15.830]  It feels like I'm just kind of chilling.
[01:15.830 --> 01:16.850]  Like I could be more hyper.
[01:16.850 --> 01:18.290]  Like I could use some caffeine or something.
[01:18.290 --> 01:21.490]  But the Guava Papaya Nectar from Green Dot Labs
[01:21.490 --> 01:22.450]  tastes great.
[01:22.450 --> 01:24.170]  It's got me nice and stoned.
[01:24.170 --> 01:25.950]  That's what I'm dabbing on today.
[01:26.910 --> 01:28.510]  And today I've been dabbing in style
[01:28.510 --> 01:30.750]  because our friends Adam Ill and Hempur Co
[01:30.750 --> 01:34.870]  sent me the Highest Host Collab Gift Box.
[01:34.870 --> 01:37.350]  It's a very cute, collectible pink box.
[01:37.350 --> 01:38.990]  It's got Adam Ill's face on it and it says,
[01:38.990 --> 01:42.750]  what all over the box because Adam Ill likes to say what.
[01:42.750 --> 01:44.470]  It's got some cool branding all over the box.
[01:44.470 --> 01:45.870]  Then when you open the box up,
[01:45.870 --> 01:48.910]  you are styled out and ready to dab.
[01:48.910 --> 01:51.310]  There is everything you need to dab inside this box
[01:51.310 --> 01:52.950]  except some dabs and a torch.
[01:52.950 --> 01:54.970]  Other than that, you're pretty much ready to go.
[01:54.970 --> 01:56.390]  I busted the box open.
[01:56.390 --> 01:58.850]  There is a rig inside the box.
[01:58.850 --> 01:59.850]  It's a very cute little rig.
[01:59.850 --> 02:00.730]  It's shaped like a cup.
[02:00.730 --> 02:02.930]  It looks like maybe a small cup that you'd get some,
[02:02.930 --> 02:04.890]  maybe if you ordered orange juice in at McDonald's
[02:04.890 --> 02:06.550]  or something or some fast food joint.
[02:06.550 --> 02:08.010]  It's that style of a cup shape.
[02:08.010 --> 02:10.410]  It's got a straw coming out of it for a mouthpiece.
[02:10.410 --> 02:12.830]  The best part is on the front part of the rig,
[02:12.830 --> 02:15.010]  there is a picture of my boy Adam Ill.
[02:15.010 --> 02:15.890]  He's just looking at you.
[02:15.890 --> 02:17.410]  You can see him going, what?
[02:17.410 --> 02:19.970]  And then it says Adam Ill times Hempur on the bottom there.
[02:19.970 --> 02:20.930]  It's got a disc perk,
[02:20.930 --> 02:22.690]  which was actually done in an amber color.
[02:22.690 --> 02:25.430]  And then the straw itself was done in an amber color also.
[02:25.430 --> 02:27.770]  I like the way that the mouthpiece kind of flares out.
[02:27.770 --> 02:29.650]  I like those flared out mouthpieces.
[02:29.650 --> 02:32.370]  Great little rig from our friends at Adam Ill and Hempur Co.
[02:32.370 --> 02:34.050]  And then also they threw in a banger.
[02:34.050 --> 02:37.090]  So it came with a 14 millimeter banger,
[02:37.090 --> 02:39.130]  a male banger that fits right into the rig.
[02:39.130 --> 02:40.450]  This thing is super thick.
[02:40.450 --> 02:41.890]  It holds heat really well.
[02:41.890 --> 02:44.850]  So pretty much all I needed now was a torch and some dabs
[02:44.850 --> 02:45.690]  and I was able to dab.
[02:45.690 --> 02:47.970]  And of course I've got that, but wait, there's more.
[02:47.970 --> 02:49.610]  They included a whole bunch of sweet accessories.
[02:49.610 --> 02:50.610]  I'm not going to go over everything,
[02:50.610 --> 02:52.850]  but there's a pack of Q-tips in there
[02:52.850 --> 02:54.370]  to keep the new banger clean.
[02:54.370 --> 02:56.350]  And then one of my favorite things was random.
[02:56.350 --> 02:59.490]  There are some snap cap alcohol swabs.
[02:59.490 --> 03:01.290]  They've got alcohol Q-tips.
[03:01.290 --> 03:03.330]  So they're a Q-tip that you crack the tip
[03:03.330 --> 03:05.090]  and then it becomes wet with alcohol.
[03:05.090 --> 03:05.930]  What?
[03:05.930 --> 03:07.450]  So now you've got some alcohol soaked Q-tips
[03:07.450 --> 03:09.730]  to clean your banger, to help clean your stuff up.
[03:09.730 --> 03:10.930]  Super helpful there.
[03:10.930 --> 03:11.930]  There were some papers in there.
[03:11.930 --> 03:13.250]  There's some stickers in there.
[03:13.250 --> 03:15.770]  There's a wristband with a stash pocket on the back of it.
[03:15.770 --> 03:17.130]  That's going to be useful.
[03:17.130 --> 03:19.170]  And then also my favorite part,
[03:19.170 --> 03:22.530]  there's an Adam Il air freshener for your car.
[03:23.410 --> 03:24.970]  There are a few other cool items in here.
[03:24.970 --> 03:27.730]  There's a silicone ashtray with a cone in the middle of it.
[03:27.730 --> 03:29.410]  So you can catch your bowls on that.
[03:29.410 --> 03:31.170]  There's a small torch lighter
[03:31.170 --> 03:32.730]  so that you can light your blunts.
[03:32.730 --> 03:34.570]  There's a hemp wick in here.
[03:34.570 --> 03:36.850]  There are a couple other small accessories,
[03:36.850 --> 03:38.490]  but it's a really well put together package.
[03:38.490 --> 03:39.850]  I think this was well thought out
[03:39.850 --> 03:41.290]  and I wanted to make sure to say thank you
[03:41.290 --> 03:43.530]  to Hemper Co and my buddy Adam Il
[03:43.530 --> 03:45.170]  and also a big shout out to Dab and Granny
[03:45.170 --> 03:48.450]  for making sure I got on the list for one of these boxes.
[03:48.450 --> 03:49.730]  So big shout out to everybody
[03:49.730 --> 03:51.470]  for taking such good care of me.
[03:52.650 --> 03:54.370]  All right, you guys, one more thing to talk about
[03:54.370 --> 03:57.530]  before we get into the main topic of this podcast.
[03:57.530 --> 04:00.850]  A couple of episodes ago, I talked about my strain Arise
[04:00.850 --> 04:03.850]  and I requested my audience to go to Leafly
[04:03.850 --> 04:06.930]  and help me get Arise posted on the website Leafly.
[04:06.930 --> 04:09.310]  Leafly is a website that many people go to
[04:09.310 --> 04:10.970]  to find strain recommendations.
[04:10.970 --> 04:13.290]  They list a lot of strains there.
[04:13.290 --> 04:14.530]  You can click on the strain.
[04:14.530 --> 04:16.370]  You can read reviews from other consumers.
[04:16.370 --> 04:18.210]  You can see what it smokes like.
[04:18.970 --> 04:19.810]  You can see what the high is like.
[04:19.810 --> 04:21.450]  You can see how it smells and tastes.
[04:21.450 --> 04:22.650]  You can also click on the strain
[04:22.650 --> 04:24.970]  and get a bunch of information about how it grows,
[04:24.970 --> 04:26.370]  about how it was bred.
[04:26.370 --> 04:28.850]  Leafly is a great resource for a lot of people
[04:28.850 --> 04:30.650]  who are new to the cannabis industry
[04:30.650 --> 04:32.430]  and want to discover new strains
[04:32.430 --> 04:34.370]  without having to go to the dispensary
[04:34.370 --> 04:35.850]  and biogram of everything.
[04:35.850 --> 04:37.310]  So it's a good place for them to find out
[04:37.310 --> 04:40.130]  what they're interested in and what may get their attention
[04:40.130 --> 04:42.510]  and also what may work for them medically.
[04:42.510 --> 04:47.510]  So I'm trying to get Arise listed on leafly.com.
[04:47.550 --> 04:49.630]  All I did was say, hey guys, go do this for me
[04:49.630 --> 04:52.470]  and I gave vague instructions on how to do so.
[04:52.470 --> 04:54.270]  Since then I've gotten a couple of messages saying,
[04:54.270 --> 04:56.470]  hey dude, how do I do this?
[04:56.470 --> 04:58.150]  I've noticed that it is hard to figure out
[04:58.150 --> 05:00.150]  where to create a new strain review
[05:00.150 --> 05:01.710]  if you're not familiar with Leafly.
[05:01.710 --> 05:05.190]  So this is a brief explanation on how to do a review
[05:05.190 --> 05:08.210]  on a strain that does not exist on Leafly.
[05:08.210 --> 05:10.710]  These instructions are based on using the website,
[05:10.710 --> 05:11.750]  not the application.
[05:11.750 --> 05:13.250]  I don't have the app in my phone.
[05:13.250 --> 05:14.870]  I open up a web browser.
[05:14.870 --> 05:17.230]  I go to leafly.com.
[05:17.950 --> 05:19.670]  Then either log in or create an account.
[05:19.670 --> 05:21.230]  It's really easy to create an account.
[05:21.230 --> 05:22.510]  It won't take you that long.
[05:22.510 --> 05:24.390]  You have to have an account to leave a review
[05:24.390 --> 05:25.690]  or to create a new strain.
[05:25.690 --> 05:28.270]  So create a new account, log in.
[05:28.270 --> 05:32.070]  Then from there, you will click on your name
[05:32.070 --> 05:35.350]  and it will bring a menu with other options.
[05:35.350 --> 05:37.830]  On that menu, it'll say profile, activity.
[05:37.830 --> 05:39.110]  It'll have your location.
[05:39.110 --> 05:40.270]  It'll say settings.
[05:40.270 --> 05:42.390]  Then it says add strain review.
[05:42.390 --> 05:44.770]  That's where you want to click, add strain review.
[05:44.770 --> 05:46.010]  That will take you to the page
[05:46.010 --> 05:48.850]  where you can actually add a new strain.
[05:48.850 --> 05:50.290]  So it says create a new review.
[05:50.290 --> 05:52.150]  It says enter name.
[05:52.150 --> 05:54.970]  In box one right there, just type the word arise.
[05:54.970 --> 05:57.930]  Arise is not currently in Leafly's database.
[05:57.930 --> 06:00.970]  So on step two, where it says select item to review,
[06:00.970 --> 06:03.610]  you will have to click add arise.
[06:03.610 --> 06:05.570]  Then step three is select type.
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.530]  It is a strain.
[06:06.530 --> 06:08.450]  You are not reviewing an edible or a topical.
[06:08.450 --> 06:10.170]  This is a strain.
[06:10.170 --> 06:12.690]  Number four, select category.
[06:12.690 --> 06:14.330]  Arise is a hybrid.
[06:14.330 --> 06:15.950]  It is a sativa dominant hybrid,
[06:16.790 --> 06:17.630]  but it is a hybrid.
[06:17.630 --> 06:18.950]  Now once you've clicked on all of that,
[06:18.950 --> 06:20.750]  it will take you to the next page,
[06:20.750 --> 06:22.550]  which is where you can type a review.
[06:22.550 --> 06:24.310]  It will ask you to rate this strain,
[06:24.310 --> 06:26.830]  overall review, one through five stars.
[06:26.830 --> 06:29.030]  Of course, I encourage you to give five stars,
[06:29.030 --> 06:30.790]  but be honest.
[06:30.790 --> 06:32.550]  If you don't feel like it was worth five,
[06:32.550 --> 06:34.470]  give it what you feel like it deserves.
[06:34.470 --> 06:36.870]  Then it says what do you think about this strain?
[06:36.870 --> 06:38.010]  Talk about the appearance.
[06:38.010 --> 06:39.110]  Talk about the aroma.
[06:39.110 --> 06:40.110]  Talk about the flavor.
[06:40.110 --> 06:41.550]  Talk about the effects.
[06:41.550 --> 06:44.170]  Type in what you like about the strain.
[06:44.170 --> 06:46.610]  Then you get to continue on with the review.
[06:46.610 --> 06:49.370]  The next question is flower or concentrate.
[06:49.370 --> 06:52.170]  Were you smoking buds or was this dabs?
[06:52.170 --> 06:55.090]  Then the next question is smoke or vaporize.
[06:55.090 --> 06:58.050]  Did you roll one up or did you put it in the vaporizer?
[06:58.050 --> 06:58.930]  That's your next option.
[06:58.930 --> 07:02.210]  Then the next thing you get to answer is
[07:02.210 --> 07:05.570]  you get to talk about the effects.
[07:05.570 --> 07:07.050]  Did this get you aroused?
[07:07.050 --> 07:08.050]  Were you creative?
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.170]  Were you energetic?
[07:09.170 --> 07:12.170]  Click on any of the things that you feel like apply to you.
[07:12.170 --> 07:13.730]  Then there is a box for other.
[07:14.250 --> 07:15.610]  You can type in any words there.
[07:15.610 --> 07:17.850]  If it had some sort of an effect on you,
[07:17.850 --> 07:18.970]  make sure you list that.
[07:18.970 --> 07:21.250]  Then the next option is medical effects.
[07:21.250 --> 07:22.950]  If this had some sort of a medical effect,
[07:22.950 --> 07:25.770]  if it eased some sort of a medical condition for you,
[07:25.770 --> 07:26.730]  type that in there.
[07:26.730 --> 07:29.050]  It's already got cramps, depression, eye pressure,
[07:29.050 --> 07:30.690]  and things like that listed.
[07:30.690 --> 07:32.570]  If it did something for you medicinally,
[07:32.570 --> 07:34.050]  please type that in there.
[07:34.050 --> 07:36.010]  Then it's got medical conditions.
[07:36.010 --> 07:37.450]  If it worked for your Alzheimer's,
[07:37.450 --> 07:39.610]  your anorexia, your anxiety,
[07:39.610 --> 07:41.450]  if it worked for anything on this list,
[07:41.450 --> 07:43.570]  please click on that and it'll highlight it
[07:44.410 --> 07:45.250]  and that will add that to your review.
[07:45.250 --> 07:47.130]  There's also that box where it says other.
[07:47.130 --> 07:48.850]  Type in anything that worked for you
[07:48.850 --> 07:50.530]  that is not listed there.
[07:50.530 --> 07:51.530]  I would appreciate that.
[07:51.530 --> 07:53.790]  Then it says add potency information.
[07:53.790 --> 07:55.210]  If you happen to know the potency,
[07:55.210 --> 07:57.170]  if you bought it at a dispensary in Colorado,
[07:57.170 --> 07:58.750]  it will have the potency listed.
[07:58.750 --> 08:00.170]  Just go ahead and type that in.
[08:00.170 --> 08:02.250]  It will say add flavor information.
[08:02.250 --> 08:03.290]  When you click on that tab,
[08:03.290 --> 08:04.530]  it brings up a bunch of things
[08:04.530 --> 08:06.610]  that all you have to do is click on them and highlight them.
[08:06.610 --> 08:07.730]  And if they're highlighted,
[08:07.730 --> 08:09.490]  it will be added to your review.
[08:09.490 --> 08:10.330]  And I really like it.
[08:10.330 --> 08:14.370]  It's got ammonia, apple, berry, butter.
[08:14.370 --> 08:15.970]  There are a bunch of great things listed on here.
[08:15.970 --> 08:17.690]  Honey, lavender.
[08:17.690 --> 08:19.570]  It gives you a lot of options for listing the flavor
[08:19.570 --> 08:20.770]  and you can really get specific.
[08:20.770 --> 08:22.410]  It'll let you click on a bunch of them.
[08:22.410 --> 08:24.490]  So feel free to click on as many flavors
[08:24.490 --> 08:25.650]  as you tasted in there.
[08:25.650 --> 08:26.850]  Click on those.
[08:26.850 --> 08:28.710]  Then the next question is dispensary.
[08:28.710 --> 08:30.490]  If you remember where you picked it up,
[08:30.490 --> 08:31.530]  go ahead and type that in there.
[08:31.530 --> 08:33.330]  If you don't remember, that's okay.
[08:33.330 --> 08:36.330]  If you got it on the street, if you grew it,
[08:36.330 --> 08:37.810]  if you don't want to reveal where it came from,
[08:37.810 --> 08:39.430]  you can leave that tab blank
[08:39.430 --> 08:40.630]  and that will be just fine.
[08:40.630 --> 08:43.510]  Then at the end, you just click save my review.
[08:43.510 --> 08:46.150]  And now you have successfully reviewed Arise
[08:46.150 --> 08:48.670]  and you have helped me get one of my proudest creations
[08:48.670 --> 08:51.530]  listed on the website, leafly.com.
[08:51.530 --> 08:52.910]  You guys, thank you for the support.
[08:52.910 --> 08:55.090]  I truly do appreciate all of your help.
[08:55.090 --> 08:56.710]  I know I ask you guys to do something
[08:56.710 --> 08:57.750]  on every single episode.
[08:57.750 --> 09:01.110]  I either ask for Patreon help or ask for iTunes reviews.
[09:01.110 --> 09:02.790]  And now I'm up here asking for you to go
[09:02.790 --> 09:05.310]  to a totally different website and create a new account
[09:05.310 --> 09:06.830]  and review my strain for me.
[09:06.830 --> 09:08.710]  But I do appreciate all of the support
[09:08.710 --> 09:10.110]  and I couldn't do what I'm doing
[09:10.110 --> 09:12.590]  without your guys' love and support.
[09:12.590 --> 09:13.690]  So thank you for that.
[09:14.590 --> 09:16.790]  You guys, I'm only nine minutes into this show
[09:16.790 --> 09:18.450]  and my throat is starting to sound like crap.
[09:18.450 --> 09:19.930]  My voice is starting to get funky.
[09:19.930 --> 09:21.110]  So I'm gonna press pause.
[09:21.110 --> 09:22.470]  I'm gonna pound a bunch of water.
[09:22.470 --> 09:24.550]  And then when I get back, we're gonna talk about
[09:24.550 --> 09:26.670]  watering our cannabis plants.
[09:51.840 --> 09:53.640]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[09:53.640 --> 09:55.680]  While I was gone, I took some dabs of some
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.440]  Doctor Who full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[09:59.440 --> 10:02.800]  This stuff tastes like a strawberry kiwi Snapple.
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.160]  The package says passion fruit, guava, and strawberry taffy,
[10:06.160 --> 10:10.320]  but I got more of a kiwi strawberry Snapple sort of a flavor.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.260]  Kind of woke me up, snapped me out of that little
[10:12.260 --> 10:13.920]  mellow buzz from the other dabs.
[10:13.920 --> 10:15.560]  I approve.
[10:15.560 --> 10:17.320]  Now, before I pressed pause and took a break
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.520]  and hydrated and medicated, I said I was going to come back
[10:20.520 --> 10:23.200]  and talk about watering our plants.
[10:23.200 --> 10:24.440]  Something that we do every day,
[10:24.440 --> 10:26.080]  something that seems so simple,
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.360]  something that we can really do wrong
[10:28.360 --> 10:30.200]  if we're not paying attention.
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.200]  So let's get right into watering our plants.
[10:33.200 --> 10:35.160]  I'm gonna talk about something that I call
[10:35.160 --> 10:36.720]  one through five water tech.
[10:36.720 --> 10:38.560]  It's something I use to train new employees.
[10:38.560 --> 10:41.200]  It's something I go over with anybody who waters plants.
[10:41.200 --> 10:43.280]  They get trained on one through five water tech.
[10:43.280 --> 10:45.880]  It's something I could recommend to every commercial grow.
[10:45.880 --> 10:48.080]  It's something I can recommend to every home grow.
[10:48.080 --> 10:49.840]  If you're watering with a pitcher,
[10:49.840 --> 10:51.540]  if you're watering with a watering wand,
[10:51.540 --> 10:54.040]  if you're watering with an automated drip system,
[10:54.040 --> 10:56.020]  however you have chosen to water your plants,
[10:56.020 --> 10:58.660]  this will work for you.
[10:58.660 --> 11:01.140]  Now keep in mind, when you're watering the plants,
[11:01.140 --> 11:02.940]  we need to saturate our medium.
[11:02.940 --> 11:04.420]  We don't want to leave dry spots in there.
[11:04.420 --> 11:05.580]  We want to wet everything,
[11:05.580 --> 11:08.140]  but we don't want to drown the roots.
[11:08.140 --> 11:10.900]  So you need enough water in there to get everything wet.
[11:10.900 --> 11:12.980]  You want a little bit of runoff,
[11:12.980 --> 11:14.740]  but then you don't want so much water in there
[11:14.740 --> 11:16.740]  that they're spongy and the plants are drowning
[11:16.740 --> 11:18.760]  and you have forced out all of the oxygen.
[11:18.760 --> 11:20.780]  So it's a nice balance that you need to find.
[11:20.780 --> 11:21.940]  It takes time.
[11:21.940 --> 11:24.080]  This will be a way to help you dial it in.
[11:24.080 --> 11:25.380]  Also, think about this.
[11:25.380 --> 11:27.840]  Jorge Cervantes taught us a very long time ago
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.380]  in one of the very first grow videos I ever watched,
[11:30.380 --> 11:34.380]  Jorge said, water should be abundant, but not excessive.
[11:34.380 --> 11:35.340]  So keep that in mind.
[11:35.340 --> 11:38.900]  You want an abundance of water, but not excessive water.
[11:38.900 --> 11:42.880]  So the idea behind that is to water them thoroughly,
[11:42.880 --> 11:45.300]  give them a lot of water to where the whole medium,
[11:45.300 --> 11:47.460]  all of the cocoa, all of the soil is saturated.
[11:47.460 --> 11:49.220]  There's a little water coming out of the bottom.
[11:49.220 --> 11:50.820]  Now the water is abundant.
[11:50.820 --> 11:53.260]  Now don't water it again until it needs it.
[11:53.260 --> 11:55.100]  And that is not excessive.
[11:55.780 --> 11:57.740]  You've got abundance and not excess.
[11:57.740 --> 12:00.500]  Also focus on not getting all of the water
[12:00.500 --> 12:02.260]  directly in the center of the pot.
[12:02.260 --> 12:04.060]  The roots are growing outward.
[12:04.060 --> 12:07.140]  Your freshest, hungriest, most vigorous roots
[12:07.140 --> 12:08.660]  are out there at the outer edge.
[12:08.660 --> 12:10.220]  So water the outer edge of the plant
[12:10.220 --> 12:12.300]  and let the water work its way in.
[12:12.300 --> 12:14.540]  Don't go just pouring the water dead center.
[12:14.540 --> 12:17.340]  Try to get the whole pot saturated.
[12:17.340 --> 12:19.460]  I keep saying you want the whole pot saturated
[12:19.460 --> 12:20.740]  and that's our goal.
[12:20.740 --> 12:22.920]  If you're pouring nutrients into your solution,
[12:22.920 --> 12:25.020]  you're pouring that water into that root zone,
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.500]  you want that everywhere so that every root can eat.
[12:27.500 --> 12:28.980]  You don't want it to have to go digging around
[12:28.980 --> 12:30.580]  to try to find whatever you just fed it.
[12:30.580 --> 12:31.600]  Where's the plus life?
[12:31.600 --> 12:32.440]  Where is it?
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.580]  You want it to just go, ah yeah, there's plus life.
[12:34.580 --> 12:36.460]  You just want those roots to be saturated
[12:36.460 --> 12:37.900]  or you want that dirt to be saturated
[12:37.900 --> 12:39.820]  so those roots know right where it is.
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.660]  It's right here.
[12:40.660 --> 12:41.900]  I'm just touching it already.
[12:41.900 --> 12:42.940]  It's been hand delivered to me.
[12:42.940 --> 12:45.220]  They just brought it right to me on a cafeteria tray.
[12:45.220 --> 12:46.460]  I'm gonna eat up this plus life.
[12:46.460 --> 12:47.780]  I'm gonna eat up this shine.
[12:47.780 --> 12:51.020]  I'm gonna eat up this HD and some fulvic
[12:51.020 --> 12:51.980]  and we're just gonna take it up
[12:51.980 --> 12:53.340]  because they don't have to go anywhere for it.
[12:54.180 --> 12:55.220]  Saturate your medium.
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.060]  That is my point.
[12:56.060 --> 12:57.300]  Now let's actually talk a little bit
[12:57.300 --> 13:00.540]  about one through five water tech.
[13:00.540 --> 13:02.860]  One through five is a good way to balance out
[13:02.860 --> 13:06.060]  your wet and dry cycles in your pots.
[13:06.060 --> 13:08.660]  If your plants get too dry or if they're too wet,
[13:08.660 --> 13:11.020]  you will have pH fluctuations.
[13:11.020 --> 13:12.940]  You will have slow root growth.
[13:12.940 --> 13:14.580]  Your plants will stop eating.
[13:14.580 --> 13:16.260]  You will have diminished yields.
[13:16.260 --> 13:18.740]  If your plants are too wet or too dry for too long,
[13:18.740 --> 13:20.140]  you will definitely see problems.
[13:20.140 --> 13:22.780]  You've seen what happens if plants get too dry, right?
[13:22.780 --> 13:23.700]  You know what happens.
[13:23.700 --> 13:24.580]  If they get too wet,
[13:24.580 --> 13:26.260]  I'm sure some of you have seen what happens.
[13:26.260 --> 13:28.620]  It's the same thing as if they get too dry.
[13:28.620 --> 13:31.540]  So we always try to keep our plants right at the sweet spot.
[13:31.540 --> 13:32.380]  We don't want them dry.
[13:32.380 --> 13:33.500]  We don't want them soggy.
[13:33.500 --> 13:35.340]  We want them right where I call number three.
[13:35.340 --> 13:38.860]  So let's just get right into one through five.
[13:38.860 --> 13:40.040]  Now for this to work,
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.340]  you're gonna need all of your plants in the same size
[13:43.340 --> 13:45.780]  and shape pot with the same amount of medium.
[13:45.780 --> 13:47.220]  So that's really gonna help you out.
[13:47.220 --> 13:48.980]  You'll learn from this.
[13:48.980 --> 13:49.980]  You'll learn how to adjust that.
[13:49.980 --> 13:51.380]  But if you wanna teach this technique,
[13:51.380 --> 13:53.620]  you need everything to be the same.
[13:53.620 --> 13:55.260]  You need it to all match up.
[13:55.260 --> 13:56.220]  You need it uniform.
[13:56.220 --> 13:57.780]  That makes it a lot easier to teach this
[13:57.780 --> 14:00.380]  and to keep this into production with your crew.
[14:00.380 --> 14:02.680]  So get the pot that you're gonna use.
[14:02.680 --> 14:04.860]  Get the medium that you're going to use.
[14:04.860 --> 14:07.700]  Fill that pot just like you were gonna fill it with a plant.
[14:07.700 --> 14:08.540]  Put your plant in there,
[14:08.540 --> 14:10.820]  just like you're gonna transplant a fresh plant in there.
[14:10.820 --> 14:12.020]  Pack it down just like you would.
[14:12.020 --> 14:13.220]  Do not water it.
[14:13.220 --> 14:14.060]  Get done.
[14:14.060 --> 14:14.880]  Get it all the way done.
[14:14.880 --> 14:15.820]  Have it just where you're gonna water it.
[14:15.820 --> 14:17.060]  Have all the amount of cocoa
[14:17.060 --> 14:19.100]  or all the amount of dirt that you're gonna have in there.
[14:19.100 --> 14:19.940]  Be done.
[14:19.940 --> 14:21.220]  I'm not shaking the pot that's in my hand
[14:21.220 --> 14:22.220]  that is invisible,
[14:22.220 --> 14:23.660]  but I'm shaking it to get all that dirt
[14:23.660 --> 14:24.900]  packed down to the bottom.
[14:24.900 --> 14:26.420]  Twist it a couple times to get all that dirt
[14:26.420 --> 14:27.260]  moved into place.
[14:27.260 --> 14:29.460]  Pack the plant down in there nice and tight.
[14:29.460 --> 14:30.400]  It's nice and snug.
[14:30.400 --> 14:31.240]  It's ready to go.
[14:31.240 --> 14:32.080]  All you need now is water, right?
[14:32.080 --> 14:33.140]  Don't pour the water.
[14:33.140 --> 14:34.540]  Set that pot down.
[14:34.540 --> 14:37.460]  Now get another pot and do just the same thing.
[14:37.460 --> 14:38.420]  Put a plant in there,
[14:38.420 --> 14:41.260]  fill it with cocoa or soil or whatever you're gonna use.
[14:41.260 --> 14:42.500]  Do it the same as you did the other one.
[14:42.500 --> 14:44.300]  The same exact method, the same technique.
[14:44.300 --> 14:45.340]  Pack it down.
[14:45.340 --> 14:46.260]  Make it match.
[14:46.260 --> 14:47.700]  If you do that thing where you pick up the pot
[14:47.700 --> 14:48.900]  and tap it on the ground a few times
[14:48.900 --> 14:50.300]  to get the dirt in there,
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.660]  I'm sure you just heard me hit the table.
[14:51.660 --> 14:54.100]  Just tap that in there a little bit to get it into place.
[14:54.100 --> 14:55.120]  Get it to settle.
[14:55.120 --> 14:56.220]  Shake it into place.
[14:56.220 --> 14:58.380]  Do the same thing to all of the pots.
[14:58.380 --> 15:00.660]  Now you've got one you did not pour any water through.
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.840]  Now this other pot that we just potted,
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.900]  for the sake of this training,
[15:03.900 --> 15:06.620]  let's say that we're using three gallon pots.
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.740]  Push the one pot aside.
[15:07.740 --> 15:08.860]  It doesn't get any water right now.
[15:08.860 --> 15:10.260]  Yeah, that plant's gonna start looking angry
[15:10.260 --> 15:11.460]  in a few minutes, but we'll rescue it.
[15:11.460 --> 15:13.020]  Don't worry, it'll get CPR in a little while
[15:13.020 --> 15:14.180]  after training class is over.
[15:14.180 --> 15:17.180]  But this other plant that we just put in the pot,
[15:17.180 --> 15:18.760]  let's soak the shit out of it.
[15:19.620 --> 15:20.960]  Let's pour like two, maybe three gallons of water
[15:20.960 --> 15:23.240]  through this pot until water is just gushing
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.080]  out of the bottom.
[15:24.080 --> 15:26.720]  We may kill this plant, but this is the sake of training.
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.840]  So we're gonna just pour water through it
[15:28.840 --> 15:30.480]  until it's saturated.
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.920]  And then when you think it's saturated with water,
[15:32.920 --> 15:34.360]  pour a little bit more in there.
[15:34.360 --> 15:36.160]  Just to where it is just pouring out of the bottom
[15:36.160 --> 15:38.360]  uncontrollably to where you've made a mess on the floor
[15:38.360 --> 15:39.880]  and you're like, what the hell is happening?
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.000]  You're kind of mad at me about it now.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.940]  And you're like, why do I have all this water on the floor?
[15:42.940 --> 15:45.040]  This is for the sake of training.
[15:45.040 --> 15:47.080]  We wanna soak that plant to death.
[15:47.120 --> 15:49.840]  Now, while all that water is running out of there,
[15:49.840 --> 15:51.180]  I want you to pick that pot up.
[15:51.180 --> 15:53.880]  If you're using a fabric pot, it's gonna be heavy.
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.580]  You're gonna have to grab it with two hands by the edges
[15:56.580 --> 15:57.880]  and it's gonna try to stretch on you.
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.120]  It's gonna be real heavy and all the dirt,
[15:59.120 --> 16:00.560]  it's gonna act like a big grocery bag.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.880]  All the dirt's gonna cave to the bottom.
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.580]  It's gonna get real cumbersome.
[16:03.580 --> 16:05.960]  If you're using a plastic pot, you're gonna need two hands.
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.920]  You're gonna have to grab it under the lips on the edges
[16:07.920 --> 16:09.520]  and try to pick it up.
[16:09.520 --> 16:10.640]  It's gonna be really heavy.
[16:10.640 --> 16:12.040]  Remember the weight of that.
[16:12.040 --> 16:13.360]  That is a five.
[16:13.360 --> 16:14.480]  That's how we're gonna start teaching
[16:14.480 --> 16:15.680]  one through five water tech.
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.240]  That saturated, over-watered, that's a number five.
[16:19.240 --> 16:20.760]  That other pot that we pushed to the side
[16:20.760 --> 16:23.920]  that we didn't put any water in, that is a number one.
[16:23.920 --> 16:24.920]  Pick that pot up.
[16:24.920 --> 16:26.800]  When you go to pick it up, you might accidentally
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.540]  throw it up into the air after picking up that number five.
[16:29.540 --> 16:31.640]  It's gonna be super light.
[16:31.640 --> 16:33.260]  That is a number one.
[16:33.260 --> 16:35.920]  Now, let's talk a little bit about the range
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.600]  of one through five water tech.
[16:38.600 --> 16:40.880]  The idea behind water tech is picking up
[16:40.880 --> 16:43.520]  each and every single plant and deciding,
[16:43.520 --> 16:46.200]  is this a one, is this a two, is this a three,
[16:46.200 --> 16:48.640]  is this a four, is this a five?
[16:48.640 --> 16:51.260]  And then understanding how to water it appropriately
[16:51.260 --> 16:53.480]  based on your professional assessment.
[16:53.480 --> 16:55.680]  Yes, you'll be a professional after this training.
[16:55.680 --> 16:58.520]  So, number one, when you pick up the plant
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.160]  and you almost throw it up into the air
[17:00.160 --> 17:02.880]  because it's so dry, that's a number one.
[17:02.880 --> 17:04.960]  You should be able to tell by looking at the plant
[17:04.960 --> 17:06.960]  that it is at a number one.
[17:06.960 --> 17:08.860]  The leaves are drooping, they're hanging down,
[17:08.860 --> 17:11.560]  the plant looks sad, it's starting to tip over a little bit.
[17:11.560 --> 17:13.480]  The top soil or the top of your cocoa,
[17:14.320 --> 17:16.040]  the surface is starting to look a little crispy and crunchy.
[17:16.040 --> 17:18.180]  You can tell that it is visibly dry.
[17:18.180 --> 17:19.760]  That is a number one.
[17:19.760 --> 17:22.800]  That is a sign that your plant is slowly dying.
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.400]  It is not eating.
[17:24.400 --> 17:26.720]  It has got the risk of death.
[17:26.720 --> 17:29.480]  And also, you are absolutely going to have
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.880]  diminished yields.
[17:30.880 --> 17:32.340]  You are losing time.
[17:32.340 --> 17:34.080]  The whole time that plant is sitting there
[17:34.080 --> 17:37.040]  looking like death, you are wasting time.
[17:37.040 --> 17:39.040]  You are moving backwards with your growth.
[17:39.040 --> 17:40.560]  You're not making any productivity.
[17:40.560 --> 17:42.880]  You are torturing that plant and pissing it off
[17:42.920 --> 17:44.000]  and wasting time.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.680]  So, number one, undesirable.
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.920]  Also another result of a number one,
[17:48.920 --> 17:49.760]  you're fucking fired.
[17:49.760 --> 17:52.240]  If you work in a commercial grow and I'm the manager
[17:52.240 --> 17:54.200]  and I walk in and those plants are a number one,
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.760]  whoever was in charge that day is coming to the office
[17:56.760 --> 17:57.980]  and we're gonna talk about it.
[17:57.980 --> 18:00.140]  And you may not come back after that.
[18:00.140 --> 18:01.680]  So that's number one and don't be scared,
[18:01.680 --> 18:02.680]  I'm not gonna fire you guys.
[18:02.680 --> 18:06.280]  Number two, number two is when the plants need water.
[18:06.280 --> 18:08.120]  You can see it, they're just starting to droop.
[18:08.120 --> 18:09.900]  They're like, hey, can we get a drink now?
[18:09.900 --> 18:12.080]  That's number two, right when they start to droop,
[18:12.080 --> 18:14.080]  you can see the difference in the topsoil.
[18:14.080 --> 18:16.920]  That top layer is just starting to change to brownish.
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.880]  It's not totally, it's not black anymore
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.920]  like when it was moist and it's not gray
[18:20.920 --> 18:22.840]  because it's totally dry or it hasn't turned
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.880]  that cork color because it's cocoa.
[18:24.880 --> 18:26.220]  We haven't gotten that far.
[18:26.220 --> 18:28.960]  Number two, it's like, hey, we could use some water.
[18:28.960 --> 18:31.440]  That's pretty much the prime time to give it some water.
[18:31.440 --> 18:34.520]  So number two, the growth is kind of slowing down.
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.600]  The roots are going, hey man,
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.200]  we could use some water pretty soon,
[18:37.200 --> 18:39.080]  but that's right when you wanna give it some water,
[18:39.080 --> 18:40.920]  right when it hits the number two.
[18:40.920 --> 18:44.440]  Number three, number three is when it is perfect
[18:44.440 --> 18:45.560]  and thriving.
[18:46.440 --> 18:48.440]  Number three is where you want to be.
[18:48.440 --> 18:49.900]  To get to number three though,
[18:49.900 --> 18:53.080]  you're going to have to water either at a four or a five
[18:53.080 --> 18:55.600]  and let it dry down to that three
[18:55.600 --> 18:58.780]  and then maybe just a little bit past to that two.
[18:58.780 --> 19:01.480]  Now it sounds really easy if you've got a home grow,
[19:01.480 --> 19:03.380]  but what if you work in a large facility
[19:03.380 --> 19:04.920]  and you've got to leave overnight?
[19:04.920 --> 19:06.200]  In a lot of commercial facilities,
[19:06.200 --> 19:08.120]  we clock out at five or 7 p.m.
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.680]  We don't come back until seven or nine in the morning.
[19:11.680 --> 19:12.680]  The plants are still gonna be,
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.440]  the lights are still gonna be on for a little while
[19:14.440 --> 19:15.260]  when we leave.
[19:15.260 --> 19:17.320]  If we work an eight or a nine or a 10 hour shift,
[19:17.320 --> 19:18.600]  the lights are on for 12 hours.
[19:18.600 --> 19:21.280]  So we're still gonna have two hours of lights on.
[19:21.280 --> 19:22.760]  They're still gonna be, or if they're in veg,
[19:22.760 --> 19:24.320]  they're still gonna be on for way longer,
[19:24.320 --> 19:25.760]  but the plants are still gonna be on.
[19:25.760 --> 19:27.240]  So they're still gonna be active
[19:27.240 --> 19:28.480]  and they're gonna be drinking
[19:28.480 --> 19:30.400]  and then you're gonna have the night cycle to deal with.
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.620]  They're gonna have to last that shift
[19:32.620 --> 19:34.480]  until we come back to work, whatever it is.
[19:34.480 --> 19:36.520]  If we leave at, we'll say five,
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.800]  and then you have six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.600]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
[19:41.600 --> 19:43.160]  in the morning, you got 10 solid hours
[19:43.160 --> 19:44.880]  till anybody comes back and checks on them.
[19:44.880 --> 19:45.880]  They have to stay wet.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.720]  So that's why I say maybe water them at a five
[19:48.720 --> 19:51.260]  and let them chill out and work their way through.
[19:51.260 --> 19:52.840]  Let them cycle through overnight.
[19:52.840 --> 19:54.200]  And then by the time you get there in the morning,
[19:54.200 --> 19:57.000]  hopefully they're right at a three or maybe at a two
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.240]  so that you can water them.
[19:58.240 --> 20:00.660]  So that's why it's an important thing to think about.
[20:00.660 --> 20:02.960]  You may have to overwater at that five
[20:02.960 --> 20:05.120]  just so that by the time you come back to work
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.960]  the next morning, they're not at a one
[20:06.960 --> 20:07.920]  and everybody goes home
[20:07.920 --> 20:09.700]  because there are no plants to take care of.
[20:09.700 --> 20:11.960]  So I'm gonna continue on with the number three
[20:11.960 --> 20:12.920]  is where I was.
[20:12.920 --> 20:14.200]  Three is perfect.
[20:14.200 --> 20:16.360]  That's where we would like to stay all the time.
[20:16.360 --> 20:18.520]  There's the right amount of oxygen in the root zone.
[20:18.520 --> 20:19.640]  The pH is correct.
[20:19.640 --> 20:21.560]  The plants are eating, the plants are thriving,
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.920]  they're growing.
[20:22.920 --> 20:24.320]  Everybody is happy.
[20:24.320 --> 20:26.220]  Three is where we would like to stay.
[20:26.220 --> 20:28.320]  But we've got airflow and evaporation
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.760]  and science and nature to work with.
[20:29.760 --> 20:33.280]  So we can't stay at a constant, at a constant three.
[20:33.280 --> 20:35.840]  Three is kinda, if you poke your finger down
[20:35.840 --> 20:39.280]  into the dirt just about two inches
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.880]  and you feel some moisture in there,
[20:40.880 --> 20:42.400]  that's about a number three.
[20:42.400 --> 20:44.620]  They're not soaked, they're not dry.
[20:44.620 --> 20:46.240]  The plants are just going crazy.
[20:46.240 --> 20:48.440]  You can tell that is a number three
[20:48.440 --> 20:49.920]  when those plants are happy.
[20:49.920 --> 20:51.520]  So that's a number three, you guys.
[20:51.520 --> 20:53.600]  Try to, you're gonna have to dial this in and practice.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.200]  Like I said, this is gonna take some practice
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.300]  in your own garden.
[20:56.300 --> 20:57.840]  That's why I gave you a number one.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.720]  That's why I gave you a number five to see.
[20:59.720 --> 21:01.800]  And then you're gonna have to watch them a little bit
[21:01.800 --> 21:03.640]  and see where that fine line for number three is.
[21:03.640 --> 21:05.940]  Watch your plants, see when they're super happy.
[21:05.940 --> 21:07.920]  Pick up the pot, feel the weight of that.
[21:07.920 --> 21:09.440]  That's probably at number three.
[21:09.440 --> 21:11.400]  So let's move forward to number four.
[21:11.400 --> 21:14.520]  Number four is when you're just a little bit too wet.
[21:14.520 --> 21:17.960]  But honestly, number four is where I water my plants to
[21:17.960 --> 21:18.920]  right when they're watered.
[21:18.920 --> 21:21.080]  As I'm watering, I aim for number four.
[21:21.080 --> 21:22.880]  Like that's just a little bit too much water.
[21:22.880 --> 21:25.960]  I've got 10 to 20% of my water that goes in
[21:25.960 --> 21:27.700]  is dripping out of the bottom of my pots.
[21:27.700 --> 21:30.120]  But I'm making sure to water in a circle.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.120]  I don't just pour the water right into the center.
[21:32.120 --> 21:33.480]  I go around the edge of the pots
[21:33.480 --> 21:35.880]  and watch the water fill into the middle as it goes.
[21:35.880 --> 21:37.440]  It really works very well.
[21:37.440 --> 21:39.720]  So I water until about 10 or 20%
[21:39.720 --> 21:41.000]  is coming out of the bottom.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.240]  That's a number four.
[21:42.240 --> 21:45.840]  The pot is heavy, but they're not goopy and muddy.
[21:45.840 --> 21:47.560]  There's not mud in your pot.
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.040]  It is just really wet.
[21:49.040 --> 21:50.800]  And I know you're gonna have to play with this
[21:50.800 --> 21:51.640]  to figure it out.
[21:51.640 --> 21:53.560]  It depends on how much perlite you've got in there.
[21:53.560 --> 21:55.720]  It depends on how much cocoa you're using.
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.080]  It's gonna depend on a few things,
[21:57.080 --> 21:58.900]  but you'll be able to dial this in
[21:58.900 --> 22:00.740]  and customize this to your grow.
[22:00.740 --> 22:03.380]  You'll be able, if you're the manager,
[22:03.380 --> 22:05.980]  this is a good way to teach your staff on one through five.
[22:05.980 --> 22:08.460]  If you're the manager, you're catching on.
[22:08.460 --> 22:09.300]  Does that make sense?
[22:09.300 --> 22:10.340]  If you're the manager, you're bright enough.
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.740]  They trusted you and you're bright enough
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.900]  to be able to catch on to what I'm saying by now.
[22:13.900 --> 22:14.820]  If you're a home grower,
[22:14.820 --> 22:16.820]  this is a good way to teach your backup.
[22:16.820 --> 22:19.100]  Maybe you've got somebody that's gonna come help you grow
[22:19.100 --> 22:20.100]  when you go on vacation.
[22:20.100 --> 22:21.980]  Maybe you wanna get your girlfriend into there
[22:21.980 --> 22:24.380]  and you're kinda leery on teaching her how to water.
[22:24.380 --> 22:27.660]  This is a way to involve your other half into the garden.
[22:27.700 --> 22:29.060]  Maybe you wanna get the kids in there.
[22:29.060 --> 22:29.980]  Maybe you got a new grower.
[22:29.980 --> 22:32.180]  Whoever it is, this is a good way to teach people
[22:32.180 --> 22:33.780]  one through five technique.
[22:33.780 --> 22:36.620]  So number four is where I water my plants to
[22:36.620 --> 22:38.060]  right in the morning when I'm giving them
[22:38.060 --> 22:39.140]  that fresh first feed.
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.260]  I aim for number four.
[22:40.260 --> 22:41.740]  They're a little bit too wet,
[22:41.740 --> 22:43.580]  but if you watch them an hour or two later,
[22:43.580 --> 22:44.740]  they've hit number three.
[22:44.740 --> 22:45.780]  They're just fine.
[22:45.780 --> 22:47.260]  By the time the lights go off,
[22:47.260 --> 22:48.780]  they're just about to hit number two,
[22:48.780 --> 22:51.300]  but they don't cycle through much through the night.
[22:51.300 --> 22:53.100]  So the plants are gonna be just fine overnight.
[22:53.100 --> 22:54.580]  When the lights come on in the morning,
[22:54.580 --> 22:57.380]  they're either gonna be right at the low end of number three,
[22:58.060 --> 22:58.900]  just getting a little bit dry,
[22:58.900 --> 23:00.140]  or right at the top end of number two,
[23:00.140 --> 23:01.900]  just like, hey, you should water us.
[23:01.900 --> 23:03.140]  You guys, I'm not sure why,
[23:03.140 --> 23:06.300]  but at this point in the recording for about 30 seconds,
[23:07.420 --> 23:09.740]  the file just started making a hissing noise
[23:09.740 --> 23:10.860]  and it sounded terrible.
[23:10.860 --> 23:13.540]  So you only missed about 30 seconds of this episode.
[23:13.540 --> 23:15.540]  I'm going to figure out why this keeps happening
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.100]  and I'm going to correct the issue,
[23:17.100 --> 23:18.740]  but it was only about 30 seconds.
[23:18.740 --> 23:20.220]  I cut out the annoying hiss.
[23:20.220 --> 23:21.780]  So let's get back to the show.
[23:21.780 --> 23:25.900]  And also if you've got more than like 10 or 20%
[23:25.900 --> 23:27.580]  of what you're putting in coming out of the bottom,
[23:27.580 --> 23:28.740]  then you're starting to overwater.
[23:28.740 --> 23:31.980]  We only want about 10 or 20% coming out of the bottom.
[23:31.980 --> 23:34.460]  Now let's talk about the dreaded number five.
[23:34.460 --> 23:37.500]  If you were at number five, your medium is soggy.
[23:37.500 --> 23:39.660]  There's just water gushing out of the bottom of your pot.
[23:39.660 --> 23:41.660]  It may be sitting in stagnant water.
[23:41.660 --> 23:43.040]  We never want that.
[23:43.040 --> 23:44.040]  That is a number five.
[23:44.040 --> 23:45.660]  Those plants are drowning.
[23:45.660 --> 23:47.260]  They're not getting any oxygen.
[23:47.260 --> 23:48.220]  They are struggling.
[23:48.220 --> 23:49.960]  The leaves are drooping.
[23:49.960 --> 23:52.780]  They're probably starting to get kind of soft at the base
[23:52.780 --> 23:54.060]  where the stick meets the soil.
[23:54.060 --> 23:55.060]  You're gonna get mushy there
[23:55.100 --> 23:56.500]  because they're starting to rot.
[23:56.500 --> 23:58.300]  We are risking root rot.
[23:58.300 --> 23:59.940]  We are risking stem rot.
[23:59.940 --> 24:03.700]  We are risking death when the plants are that moist.
[24:03.700 --> 24:06.460]  Also, you are certainly slowing down your growth
[24:06.460 --> 24:09.300]  and diminishing your yields when you get your plants
[24:09.300 --> 24:11.660]  to a number five level of moisture.
[24:11.660 --> 24:13.140]  So try to avoid that, you guys.
[24:13.140 --> 24:16.100]  Pay attention to where number four is and stop there.
[24:16.100 --> 24:17.220]  Water the plants.
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.580]  Wait for some to come out of the bottom.
[24:18.580 --> 24:20.580]  If nothing comes out, pour in a little bit more.
[24:20.580 --> 24:22.820]  If nothing comes out, pour in a little bit more.
[24:22.820 --> 24:25.300]  If you're using a three gallon pot,
[24:25.300 --> 24:27.140]  maybe just pour in a half a gallon of water
[24:27.140 --> 24:27.980]  and see what happens.
[24:27.980 --> 24:29.380]  That's a good start.
[24:29.380 --> 24:31.380]  Then if you need more, you can always add more.
[24:31.380 --> 24:32.740]  Remember, you can't reach in there
[24:32.740 --> 24:34.960]  and take water out of that pot.
[24:34.960 --> 24:36.780]  Now that's one through five.
[24:36.780 --> 24:38.140]  One will kill the plants.
[24:38.140 --> 24:40.280]  Five, you run the risk of killing the plants.
[24:40.280 --> 24:41.800]  Three is right where you wanna be.
[24:41.800 --> 24:44.280]  You've got to figure out how to keep those plants
[24:44.280 --> 24:47.120]  right around a three for as long as possible.
[24:47.120 --> 24:47.960]  And when they get too dry,
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.000]  you gotta water them again without over watering them.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.260]  Now this is gonna be challenging
[24:52.700 --> 24:53.700]  based on the size of your plants.
[24:53.700 --> 24:54.940]  If your plants are smaller,
[24:54.940 --> 24:56.300]  they are much more critical
[24:56.300 --> 24:58.060]  through that one through five phase.
[24:58.060 --> 24:59.260]  It means a lot more to them.
[24:59.260 --> 25:01.900]  When they get bigger, they can handle a lot more stress.
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.540]  They can handle a lot more abuse.
[25:03.540 --> 25:05.760]  Once that root ball gets developed in that pot,
[25:05.760 --> 25:08.620]  they can definitely take more excessive water.
[25:08.620 --> 25:10.700]  So if you've got big plants
[25:10.700 --> 25:12.860]  and you do need to go away for a long time,
[25:12.860 --> 25:15.060]  you can soak those up to a number five.
[25:15.060 --> 25:16.340]  Just be careful.
[25:16.340 --> 25:17.960]  Just make sure that you're not keeping them
[25:17.960 --> 25:19.620]  too soggy for too long.
[25:19.620 --> 25:22.180]  Like in a large grow, I'm running three gallon pots.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.100]  We've got plants that weigh 2,000 grams
[25:24.100 --> 25:25.260]  when we harvest them.
[25:25.260 --> 25:27.060]  Those plants, right before we leave,
[25:27.060 --> 25:28.660]  I soak the shit out of them.
[25:28.660 --> 25:30.220]  I soak them to a five.
[25:30.220 --> 25:31.860]  But I'm confident that by the time
[25:31.860 --> 25:33.420]  I get back to work the next day,
[25:33.420 --> 25:35.200]  they're only gonna be at a two.
[25:35.200 --> 25:37.500]  So you've gotta learn how to dial in those cycles
[25:37.500 --> 25:38.460]  with your plants.
[25:38.460 --> 25:41.100]  The bigger plants will be more forgiving.
[25:41.100 --> 25:44.060]  The smaller plants are always going to be less forgiving.
[25:44.060 --> 25:46.860]  They will let you know when you make mistakes right away
[25:46.860 --> 25:48.920]  and their cycles will not be as long.
[25:48.920 --> 25:51.860]  So if you've gotta be away from the grow for several hours,
[25:52.540 --> 25:54.500]  make sure you water those little plants right before you go
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.140]  because they could dry up overnight
[25:56.140 --> 25:58.140]  if you're not paying attention.
[25:58.140 --> 26:00.500]  You guys, that is one through five watering tech.
[26:00.500 --> 26:02.900]  I tried to keep it as simple as I could.
[26:02.900 --> 26:05.460]  You're gonna have to get a pot and fill it
[26:05.460 --> 26:06.620]  and make that a number one.
[26:06.620 --> 26:07.900]  You're gonna have to get another pot
[26:07.900 --> 26:11.020]  and soak the shit out of it and make that a number five.
[26:11.020 --> 26:14.220]  Maybe get another one and get water running out 10 or 20%.
[26:14.220 --> 26:15.460]  That's your number four.
[26:15.460 --> 26:16.460]  Then you'll be able to figure out
[26:16.460 --> 26:18.680]  where the three and the two lie from there.
[26:18.680 --> 26:20.120]  Then you'll be able to dial it in.
[26:20.120 --> 26:22.360]  Then if you're setting up an auto water system,
[26:22.360 --> 26:25.040]  that will help you dial in how much water to give it
[26:25.040 --> 26:26.040]  and how often.
[26:26.040 --> 26:28.400]  It'll also help you to teach the new people
[26:28.400 --> 26:30.860]  how to dial in that garden perfectly.
[26:30.860 --> 26:32.280]  And keep in mind,
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.140]  cannabis is very picky and strain specific.
[26:35.140 --> 26:37.360]  So some plants may want a lot of water
[26:37.360 --> 26:40.020]  and some plants may not want any water.
[26:40.020 --> 26:44.640]  So pay attention to each cultivar, not just each table.
[26:44.640 --> 26:47.320]  You may have to think about which plants go on which table
[26:47.320 --> 26:48.960]  if you're gonna set up an auto system
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.200]  because Durban poison wants barely any water
[26:53.200 --> 26:55.760]  where Golden Goat will drink all of the water.
[26:55.760 --> 26:57.000]  So you're gonna have to plan on that
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.680]  and pay attention and adjust and adapt.
[27:01.040 --> 27:01.860]  All right, you guys,
[27:01.860 --> 27:03.560]  that's what I've got for you on one through five
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.400]  watering tech.
[27:04.400 --> 27:05.560]  I hope you guys learned something.
[27:05.560 --> 27:07.640]  I hope you're able to teach somebody else
[27:07.640 --> 27:09.520]  something about one through five water tech.
[27:09.520 --> 27:10.780]  I know it sounds simple,
[27:10.780 --> 27:13.040]  but it's probably something a lot of people
[27:13.040 --> 27:16.500]  are making mistakes on and overlooking.
[27:16.500 --> 27:18.500]  It's also something that managers
[27:18.500 --> 27:20.560]  will be able to train grow techs on,
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.700]  which will be very helpful for the cannabis industry.
[27:23.700 --> 27:24.540]  Ladies and gentlemen,
