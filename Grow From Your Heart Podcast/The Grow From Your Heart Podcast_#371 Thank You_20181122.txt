[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.320 --> 00:04.120]  It's time for episode 371
[00:04.120 --> 00:06.200]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.200 --> 00:07.560]  You might be able to tell by my voice
[00:07.560 --> 00:10.000]  that I've got a nasty little head cold.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's also Thanksgiving.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.080]  Also, my website is broken,
[00:14.080 --> 00:16.940]  so I'm unable to post the podcast to iTunes.
[00:16.940 --> 00:20.200]  So I'm not going to do a long, drawn-out grow lesson
[00:20.200 --> 00:22.880]  or an intense podcast episode for Thanksgiving.
[00:22.880 --> 00:25.240]  I just wanted to drop in and say hello
[00:25.240 --> 00:27.160]  and maybe mention a few things
[00:27.160 --> 00:28.840]  that I am thankful or grateful for.
[00:28.840 --> 00:31.640]  It's always good to be reminded and remind others
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.680]  of things that we're grateful for.
[00:33.680 --> 00:34.920]  So let's just get right into it.
[00:34.920 --> 00:37.580]  I am grateful that you folks have been listening
[00:37.580 --> 00:40.200]  to the podcast almost religiously.
[00:40.200 --> 00:42.900]  I certainly appreciate all of the listens,
[00:42.900 --> 00:45.280]  all of the clicks, all of the downloads,
[00:45.280 --> 00:46.780]  and even more than all of the listens,
[00:46.780 --> 00:49.040]  I appreciate all of the interaction.
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.480]  I appreciate all of the emails,
[00:50.480 --> 00:52.240]  all of the Instagram messages,
[00:52.240 --> 00:53.680]  all of the Twitter messages.
[00:53.680 --> 00:54.920]  It really means a lot to me.
[00:54.920 --> 00:56.560]  Thanks for listening to my show.
[00:56.560 --> 00:57.800]  Thanks for hanging out with me,
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.200]  and thanks for trusting me with your garden
[01:00.200 --> 01:03.020]  and with the cannabis advice that I give you.
[01:03.020 --> 01:05.600]  So I'm really grateful that this little podcast
[01:05.600 --> 01:07.680]  has developed into a community.
[01:07.680 --> 01:09.880]  We have got a family based around this podcast.
[01:09.880 --> 01:11.400]  We have developed the Irie Army,
[01:11.400 --> 01:13.560]  is what some of the folks have labeled this little group
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.760]  that follows the podcast so closely.
[01:15.760 --> 01:17.120]  So I want to give a big thank you
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.400]  and a giant fist bump to the Irie Army.
[01:19.400 --> 01:21.080]  I'm thankful for each and every one of you.
[01:21.080 --> 01:23.720]  It wouldn't be an army without each one of you
[01:23.720 --> 01:24.660]  filling your position.
[01:24.660 --> 01:25.960]  So thank you, guys.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.420]  Another thing I am very grateful for is the Patreon support.
[01:29.420 --> 01:32.120]  You guys have been very generous on Patreon.
[01:32.120 --> 01:32.940]  Thank you.
[01:32.940 --> 01:35.600]  I certainly notice that and I appreciate that.
[01:35.600 --> 01:37.940]  The kind folks at Best Buy certainly notice
[01:37.940 --> 01:40.640]  and appreciate your Patreon contributions.
[01:40.640 --> 01:43.520]  You guys have covered the cost of the MacBook
[01:43.520 --> 01:45.480]  that runs this podcast.
[01:45.480 --> 01:46.320]  So thank you.
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.720]  You guys have kept the podcast alive by contributing,
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.040]  and I certainly do notice it and I appreciate it.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.080]  So thank you.
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.720]  And if you're not contributing on Patreon,
[01:53.720 --> 01:54.560]  don't feel left out.
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.600]  I still appreciate you just for listening,
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.480]  just for being a part of the podcast,
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.840]  and just for trying to be a part
[01:59.840 --> 02:01.680]  of moving cannabis forward with me.
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.760]  That is my mission.
[02:02.760 --> 02:05.520]  I want to make cannabis more accepted by society.
[02:05.520 --> 02:07.120]  I want people to grow better cannabis,
[02:07.120 --> 02:09.200]  and I want people to have a better understanding
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.800]  and a better attitude toward cannabis in general.
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.840]  So just by listening and opening your mind,
[02:13.840 --> 02:15.680]  you are participating in the way you can.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.520]  So thank you.
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.720]  Thank each and every one of you
[02:17.720 --> 02:19.880]  for all of the podcast support.
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.160]  Now let's talk about some stuff that's not podcast related.
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.120]  I am grateful that I am in generally good health.
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.320]  I know I sound like shit today.
[02:27.320 --> 02:28.640]  I've got a little cold, big deal.
[02:28.640 --> 02:29.480]  That'll go away.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.320]  I took some medicine.
[02:30.320 --> 02:31.240]  I took a lot of vitamins.
[02:31.240 --> 02:32.520]  I feel the medicine kicking in.
[02:32.520 --> 02:33.800]  My palms are getting super sweaty.
[02:33.800 --> 02:35.440]  So this cold will be knocked out.
[02:35.440 --> 02:36.360]  For the most part,
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.480]  I am in good general health mentally and physically.
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.000]  I'm grateful for that.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.640]  I feel like I'm doing fairly well business-wise.
[02:43.640 --> 02:45.320]  The podcast is part of my business.
[02:45.320 --> 02:47.000]  The podcast is taking off.
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.760]  Seed sales are taking off.
[02:48.760 --> 02:51.080]  I feel like iRegenetics is going really far.
[02:51.080 --> 02:52.520]  We have spread our wings quite far.
[02:52.600 --> 02:53.520]  We've got a far reach.
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.000]  Seeds are going everywhere.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.920]  People are really happy with the products.
[02:56.920 --> 02:58.880]  The merchandise is selling quite well.
[02:58.880 --> 03:01.040]  Everybody is happy with the company.
[03:01.040 --> 03:04.400]  Myself, the customers, the vendors, everybody is satisfied.
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.720]  It's growing, it's expanding.
[03:05.720 --> 03:06.920]  I'm really grateful for that.
[03:06.920 --> 03:07.880]  That was my little dream.
[03:07.880 --> 03:09.760]  One day I was like, I'm going to make a seed company.
[03:09.760 --> 03:10.600]  And look, here it is.
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.440]  It's happening, you guys.
[03:11.440 --> 03:12.280]  I'm doing it.
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.560]  So I'm really grateful for that.
[03:13.560 --> 03:15.000]  I set my mind to something.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.760]  I thought about steps of how to do it.
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.160]  And I took those steps and it is happening.
[03:19.160 --> 03:21.920]  So I'm grateful that my efforts are finally paying off.
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.560]  It's been a long time, but it is doing something now.
[03:24.560 --> 03:25.400]  And I see it.
[03:25.400 --> 03:26.680]  I can actually see the growth.
[03:26.680 --> 03:27.920]  I can see the explosion.
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.960]  And I'm really grateful for that.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.600]  Through the expansion of my company,
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.880]  through social media,
[03:32.880 --> 03:34.720]  through all of the things I have done
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.560]  in the past few months,
[03:35.560 --> 03:37.760]  I have made a lot of new friends,
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.640]  some really close friends.
[03:39.640 --> 03:42.360]  I'm really grateful for all of the friends I have made
[03:42.360 --> 03:45.520]  locally and through social media worldwide.
[03:45.520 --> 03:47.880]  I talk to a lot of people that are nowhere near me.
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.480]  I've got friends in other states
[03:49.480 --> 03:51.240]  that I talk to more than some people
[03:51.280 --> 03:52.600]  that are really close to me.
[03:52.600 --> 03:54.920]  So everybody from the people in my neighborhood,
[03:54.920 --> 03:55.960]  the people in my house,
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.080]  to the people worldwide that I interact with,
[03:58.080 --> 04:00.280]  my little support team, my friendship circle,
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.440]  I'm fucking super grateful for each and every one of you.
[04:03.440 --> 04:05.200]  If you've texted me and I've replied,
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.520]  if we've had a conversation,
[04:06.520 --> 04:07.520]  that meant something to me.
[04:07.520 --> 04:08.920]  So I'm thankful for you.
[04:08.920 --> 04:10.320]  Thank you.
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.600]  I don't talk too much about my family life on the podcast
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.000]  because quite frankly, that's not what we're here for.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  We're here to talk about cannabis,
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.160]  but I'm talking about what I'm grateful for.
[04:18.160 --> 04:21.040]  I recently had a health scare with a family member
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.800]  and I am extremely grateful he pulled through on that.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.520]  He's still got a long ways to go,
[04:25.520 --> 04:27.880]  but it was scary as shit for a couple of days there.
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.520]  And I'm extremely grateful that he is okay.
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.200]  I'm also super thankful and grateful
[04:32.200 --> 04:34.080]  that my mom is still in good health.
[04:34.080 --> 04:34.960]  She's probably my,
[04:34.960 --> 04:37.200]  she's certainly my closest family member.
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.080]  My mom's probably my best friend, you guys.
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.960]  So I'm really grateful that my mom can be my best friend
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.600]  and that she is still in good health
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.040]  because she's not a spring chicken.
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.360]  She's getting up there in age.
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.000]  So I'm really thankful that she's still
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.280]  in fairly good health.
[04:50.320 --> 04:52.240]  Also, I'm glad my daughter's doing well.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.960]  I don't talk about my kid on the show a lot,
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.880]  but if I'm talking about shit I'm grateful for,
[04:55.880 --> 04:57.400]  I'm really grateful for that kid.
[04:57.400 --> 04:59.840]  Everything about her, I'm grateful for.
[04:59.840 --> 05:01.560]  I feel like those are most of the big, major,
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.200]  obvious points I should be grateful for.
[05:03.200 --> 05:05.280]  My friends, my family, my loved ones,
[05:05.280 --> 05:07.040]  my business, my general health.
[05:07.040 --> 05:08.600]  I'm really grateful for all of that stuff,
[05:08.600 --> 05:10.200]  but also there are random things
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.320]  that make me happy every day.
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.480]  Just the fact that I can drive just about any direction.
[05:15.480 --> 05:16.600]  I can go 10 minutes that way.
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.960]  I can go 10 minutes that way.
[05:17.960 --> 05:19.960]  And I will arrive at a dispensary
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.160]  that allows me to buy some of the best cannabis flowers
[05:23.160 --> 05:25.840]  and cannabis concentrates on the planet.
[05:25.840 --> 05:28.120]  I am really grateful for that ability.
[05:28.120 --> 05:29.760]  I spent too many years of my life
[05:29.760 --> 05:31.280]  having to hunt down some good herb.
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.920]  I spent too many years of my life
[05:32.920 --> 05:34.800]  having to grow good herb just to have it around.
[05:34.800 --> 05:36.120]  I spent too many years of my life
[05:36.120 --> 05:37.800]  having to watch over my shoulder
[05:37.800 --> 05:39.480]  because I consumed cannabis.
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.720]  So I'm really grateful for the situation
[05:41.720 --> 05:43.520]  that we are in with cannabis now.
[05:43.520 --> 05:45.000]  Of course, things could be different.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.240]  There are some things I would adjust with the rules.
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.800]  I would raise plant counts.
[05:48.840 --> 05:50.480]  I would make a lot of things a little bit different,
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.080]  but I am grateful that I'm able to acquire the stuff
[05:54.080 --> 05:57.520]  that I enjoy and not have to feel like a criminal.
[05:57.520 --> 05:59.440]  Something random that I'm suddenly grateful for,
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.840]  I can feel this medicine I took starting to work.
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.600]  My sinuses are loosening up.
[06:03.600 --> 06:04.880]  I'm starting to feel a lot better.
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.840]  So I'm definitely grateful that I have access to medicine
[06:08.840 --> 06:10.720]  that when I am not feeling well,
[06:10.720 --> 06:11.560]  I know I'm stubborn.
[06:11.560 --> 06:13.000]  I don't take medicine until I'm about to die,
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.200]  but I really needed some.
[06:14.200 --> 06:16.880]  I finally took it and I feel much better already.
[06:16.920 --> 06:19.400]  So I'm grateful for that stuff working.
[06:19.400 --> 06:21.320]  Another random thing that I'm really thankful
[06:21.320 --> 06:25.000]  and grateful for is my ability to play the drums.
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.360]  I'm very musical on the drums.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.520]  I'm very gifted on the drums.
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.640]  I'm not trying to brag.
[06:28.640 --> 06:31.400]  I am more grateful than bragging about it right now.
[06:31.400 --> 06:34.040]  That is something that I am really proud of.
[06:34.040 --> 06:37.320]  And I feel like I am blessed to be able to play the drums
[06:37.320 --> 06:38.160]  the way that I do.
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.440]  So I'm absolutely grateful on that.
[06:39.440 --> 06:40.760]  That really feels like a humble brag,
[06:40.760 --> 06:43.720]  but I'm so grateful because a lot of my life,
[06:43.720 --> 06:45.160]  I made a living playing the drums.
[06:45.160 --> 06:46.760]  I traveled around the country playing the drums.
[06:47.640 --> 06:48.480]  I got paid playing the drums.
[06:48.480 --> 06:50.040]  I learned how, I guess I kind of learned a lot
[06:50.040 --> 06:53.160]  about business being sort of the band manager.
[06:53.160 --> 06:55.440]  I'm the obnoxious guy in the group most of the time.
[06:55.440 --> 06:57.440]  I'm the big guy in the group a lot of the times.
[06:57.440 --> 06:59.640]  So I would be the guy that was sent to tell the club owner,
[06:59.640 --> 07:01.600]  fuck you, pay me when things didn't go right.
[07:01.600 --> 07:04.680]  So I learned a lot about business by being in a band
[07:04.680 --> 07:05.520]  and being the drummer.
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.240]  So I'm grateful that I had the skills to be a drummer
[07:08.240 --> 07:09.240]  that took me places.
[07:09.240 --> 07:12.160]  And I'm also grateful that I learned some business
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.840]  throughout that process.
[07:13.880 --> 07:16.880]  And of course I'm super, super grateful and thankful
[07:16.880 --> 07:19.280]  for the skills I have acquired and developed
[07:19.280 --> 07:21.400]  within the cannabis industry.
[07:21.400 --> 07:23.000]  This plant has taken me far
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.200]  and I owe a great respect to the cannabis plant.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.720]  So I'm grateful for the plant.
[07:26.720 --> 07:28.440]  I'm grateful for the industry.
[07:28.440 --> 07:30.040]  Like I said earlier, there are several things
[07:30.040 --> 07:32.040]  I would change about legalization.
[07:32.040 --> 07:33.720]  There are so many things I would change
[07:33.720 --> 07:34.720]  about the cannabis industry,
[07:34.720 --> 07:37.280]  but overall I'm grateful that the cannabis industry
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.760]  even exists and I'm grateful to be involved in it
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.800]  on any level.
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.680]  And I'm grateful to have been accepted by so many people
[07:44.520 --> 07:45.520]  as a teacher, as an advocate,
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.840]  and somebody that people look up to and respect
[07:47.840 --> 07:48.760]  in the cannabis industry.
[07:48.760 --> 07:52.240]  I'm really thankful and grateful for all of that.
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.760]  And one last thing, just to wrap this up,
[07:53.760 --> 07:54.880]  because my voice sounds like shit
[07:54.880 --> 07:56.440]  and I think this is getting long enough.
[07:56.440 --> 07:58.720]  I am super grateful to live in this age
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.840]  of information and technology.
[08:00.840 --> 08:02.440]  You should never say, I wonder,
[08:02.440 --> 08:04.160]  because there's no need to wonder.
[08:04.160 --> 08:06.000]  There is a device in most of our pockets.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.280]  We can pull it out and we can find the answer
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.520]  to almost anything you wonder.
[08:10.520 --> 08:12.000]  Of course, there's some existential shit
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.240]  you should always wonder.
[08:13.760 --> 08:16.160]  But most facts, most info, it's in your phone.
[08:16.160 --> 08:17.080]  Go find out.
[08:17.080 --> 08:17.920]  I love it.
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.960]  I love being a part of this generation, this time period.
[08:21.960 --> 08:23.120]  I love being right here.
[08:23.120 --> 08:25.840]  I'm very grateful that I am a part of this,
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.640]  whatever we're gonna call it, this revolution,
[08:27.640 --> 08:29.320]  this timeframe, this era.
[08:29.320 --> 08:32.760]  I am excited, thankful, and grateful to be right here
[08:32.760 --> 08:35.520]  in this time today, right now.
[08:35.520 --> 08:36.600]  All right, podcast world,
[08:36.600 --> 08:38.120]  thank you for letting me share things
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.080]  I am thankful and grateful for.
[08:40.080 --> 08:42.200]  I hope I reminded you of a few things
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.240]  that you are thankful and grateful for.
[08:44.240 --> 08:46.960]  Once again, thank you for listening to this podcast.
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.920]  I know that the episode 370 has not made it to iTunes
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.360]  at the time of this recording.
[08:52.360 --> 08:54.640]  There is a technical issue with my website.
[08:54.640 --> 08:56.520]  I have got the web guy working on it.
[08:56.520 --> 08:59.240]  Of course, it is the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
[08:59.240 --> 09:00.760]  He has got some time with his family,
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.240]  which I totally understand.
[09:02.240 --> 09:04.000]  So we are putting all of that sort of stuff
[09:04.000 --> 09:04.880]  on the back burner.
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.800]  We're just gonna chill out.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.280]  We're gonna enjoy time with our family.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.880]  I'm gonna get over this head cold.
[09:08.880 --> 09:11.120]  We're gonna take care of this stuff after the holiday.
[09:11.120 --> 09:13.920]  Everything should be back to business really soon.
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.640]  Sometimes when you're working with the internet
[09:15.640 --> 09:17.920]  and computers and coding, shit just goes wonky.
[09:17.920 --> 09:19.240]  And this is one of those times
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.840]  we're trying not to stress over it.
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.640]  We're just gonna enjoy the holiday season.
[09:22.640 --> 09:24.560]  You guys enjoy the holiday season also.
[09:24.560 --> 09:25.960]  Thanks for being patient with me.
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.520]  As soon as we get the website fixed,
[09:27.520 --> 09:28.840]  we will put the episodes up.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.160]  I will keep recording episodes.
[09:30.160 --> 09:31.400]  I'm not going to stop.
[09:31.400 --> 09:33.960]  I'm sure some of you have found the episodes on YouTube.
[09:33.960 --> 09:35.280]  YouTube is still letting me post.
[09:35.280 --> 09:36.120]  That's really easy.
[09:36.120 --> 09:38.120]  It's a different method of posting.
[09:38.120 --> 09:39.680]  So that's not stopped at all.
[09:39.680 --> 09:41.060]  YouTube will continue.
[09:42.000 --> 09:42.840]  Once I get things back together,
[09:42.840 --> 09:45.420]  we'll get it all up on iTunes and Stitcher just like normal.
[09:45.420 --> 09:47.180]  Hey guys, thanks for letting me ramble at you
[09:47.180 --> 09:48.340]  for a good 10 minutes.
[09:48.340 --> 09:50.300]  I hope everybody had a great safe holiday.
[09:50.300 --> 09:52.180]  Even if you're not celebrating Thanksgiving,
[09:52.180 --> 09:53.700]  wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
[09:53.700 --> 09:55.140]  I hope you're hanging out with some loved ones.
[09:55.140 --> 09:56.740]  I hope you're eating something delicious
[09:56.740 --> 09:59.580]  and I hope you got to smoke some great cannabis products
[09:59.580 --> 10:01.660]  with your friends and family.
[10:01.660 --> 10:02.700]  All right, podcast world,
[10:02.700 --> 10:04.780]  it is time for me to wrap up this episode.
[10:04.780 --> 10:06.260]  I want to thank you for hanging out.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.500]  I will be back Monday.
[10:07.500 --> 10:10.060]  Hopefully my voice sounds a little bit better for you.
[10:10.060 --> 10:13.340]  No advertising, no shout outs, just a big thank you.
[10:13.340 --> 10:14.300]  And until next time,
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.940]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
