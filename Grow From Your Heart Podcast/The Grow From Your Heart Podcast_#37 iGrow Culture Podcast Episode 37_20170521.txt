[00:16.660 --> 00:18.660]  I'm a rockin' a hundred dollar bag
[00:18.660 --> 00:19.660]  When you see me now they party me
[00:19.660 --> 00:21.660]  And Shady got us started in the max
[00:21.660 --> 00:22.660]  We'll be broad
[00:22.660 --> 00:23.660]  Hundred dollar bag
[00:23.660 --> 00:25.660]  If you see the house where we live
[00:25.660 --> 00:26.660]  Car that we drive
[00:26.660 --> 00:27.660]  Axe of Mel we get it
[00:27.660 --> 00:28.660]  Hundred dollar bag
[00:28.660 --> 00:29.660]  And if a night that we...
[00:29.660 --> 00:31.660]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen?
[00:31.660 --> 00:34.660]  Welcome to episode number 37 of the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[00:34.660 --> 00:35.660]  It's me again, Rasta Jeff.
[00:35.660 --> 00:36.660]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:36.660 --> 00:39.660]  Joining me on the microphone today is Jesse from iGrow.
[00:39.660 --> 00:40.660]  How you doing, bro?
[00:40.660 --> 00:41.660]  How's it going, guys?
[00:41.660 --> 00:42.660]  Doing pretty good.
[00:42.660 --> 00:43.660]  Dude, thanks for coming.
[00:43.660 --> 00:44.660]  Right on.
[00:44.660 --> 00:47.660]  In this episode, Jesse and I are going to talk a little bit about building your grow space.
[00:47.660 --> 00:51.660]  Honestly, this may end up being a multi-episode discussion
[00:51.660 --> 00:52.660]  because I know we're going to leave stuff out.
[00:52.660 --> 00:53.660]  We're going to forget things.
[00:53.660 --> 00:55.660]  We took quite a few notes.
[00:55.660 --> 00:57.660]  We wrote quite a bit of stuff down.
[00:57.660 --> 00:59.660]  And the more I wrote, the more I feel like we were missing.
[00:59.660 --> 01:02.660]  So we're going to try to keep notes on what we're missing while we go.
[01:02.660 --> 01:04.660]  And we'll keep this conversation going.
[01:04.660 --> 01:08.660]  But before we get to that part, we got to pay some bills.
[01:08.660 --> 01:11.660]  This podcast is brought to you by Cannabis Grand Crew.

[03:00.660 --> 03:02.660]  It's going to be fancy. It's in Aspen.
[03:02.660 --> 03:07.660]  It's a little far from here, and I have things going on that week, so I'm not sure.
[03:07.660 --> 03:10.660]  I want to go really badly, but somebody may end up with a free ticket.
[03:10.660 --> 03:15.660]  We'll keep going. This podcast is also brought to you by our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.

[05:06.660 --> 05:11.660]  All right, that's enough commercials for today. We're going to get on with some show.
[05:11.660 --> 05:13.660]  Jesse and I are here.
[05:13.660 --> 05:18.660]  Last night, Jesse hosted a small gathering for growers over at Hygro.
[05:18.660 --> 05:20.660]  The party was a huge success, dude.
[05:20.660 --> 05:26.660]  Yeah, had a great response, great turnout. I was really stoked about it.
[05:26.660 --> 05:30.660]  Jesse didn't advertise much. It was kind of a test run.
[05:30.660 --> 05:32.660]  We just wanted to kind of see what would happen.
[05:32.660 --> 05:34.660]  He wanted to see what would happen.
[05:34.660 --> 05:36.660]  We had about 12 people there for most of the evening.
[05:36.660 --> 05:39.660]  I'd say about 20 people showed up for the peak of the night.
[05:39.660 --> 05:43.660]  When Spence and Maddie and Big Mike and Michael showed up, that made about 20 people in the room.
[05:43.660 --> 05:46.660]  Big shout out to everybody that came, the people that I met, the people that I already knew.
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.660]  Thanks for coming and supporting something like that.
[05:48.660 --> 05:51.660]  Big, huge thanks to Bert and Jesse and Hygro for letting us gather in the store.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.660]  That was a great time.
[05:52.660 --> 05:54.660]  Yeah, it was fun. We had some pizza.
[05:54.660 --> 05:57.660]  We had some pizza. Thanks for feeding me, dude. That was great.
[05:57.660 --> 06:01.660]  Last night was kind of just a test run to see how many people we could get to show up.
[06:01.660 --> 06:02.660]  Do you plan on doing this more?
[06:02.660 --> 06:08.660]  Yeah, we're going to set a date real soon for next month, probably on Monday.
[06:08.660 --> 06:10.660]  Cool, trying to make it like a monthly event?
[06:10.660 --> 06:11.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:11.660 --> 06:13.660]  Sweet. Who's invited? Can anybody come?
[06:13.660 --> 06:24.660]  Yeah, yeah. It's 21 and up, but anyone's invited, just come down to the store and ask for info or whatever.
[06:24.660 --> 06:29.660]  Cool. Did you make a Facebook page or anything for it?
[06:29.660 --> 06:34.660]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. There was a Facebook event.
[06:35.660 --> 06:42.660]  I don't think I can do it from the iReed Genetics page or from the Hygro Culture page, but I can do it from my personal.
[06:42.660 --> 06:48.660]  I'll make an event or I'll share Jesse's event as soon as the next one comes up, and we'll talk about it on the show, and we'll let you guys know.
[06:48.660 --> 06:52.660]  We hope to get more growers from the Pueblo area coming out to the gathering.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.660]  We'll announce it for sure when we get it figured out.
[06:54.660 --> 06:57.660]  Hopefully, we can get some listeners out there and meet the people.
[06:57.660 --> 07:00.660]  They can come shake our hands, and we can find out who we're talking to.
[07:00.660 --> 07:01.660]  For sure.
[07:01.660 --> 07:03.660]  Armando, we want you to come to one.
[07:03.660 --> 07:04.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:04.660 --> 07:11.660]  All right, so we were talking about building your grow rooms, and last night there were actually some new growers at the party, and we got to help them build a pretty sweet room.
[07:11.660 --> 07:18.660]  It was kind of nice to – they're like, we don't know what to do, and Jesse and I looked at each other, and it was neat because we had the exact same idea in our heads.
[07:18.660 --> 07:21.660]  We're like, do this, and they pretty much are going to do that, I think.
[07:21.660 --> 07:28.660]  So on this show, we're going to talk about a few different ways to set up a grow space that is suitable for your production needs.
[07:28.660 --> 07:35.660]  I also found a comment on the Facebook page that asks for guidance in building a space for $500.
[07:35.660 --> 07:39.660]  That's a really tight budget for a grow room, but I'll see what I can come up with.
[07:39.660 --> 07:44.660]  I Googled a few items to try to save some pennies, but that's a challenge, dude, $500.
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.660]  How big is the space?
[07:46.660 --> 07:48.660]  Well, she just said, help me out.
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.660]  Teach me how to build a space for $500.
[07:50.660 --> 07:52.660]  She said she's on a very low budget.
[07:52.660 --> 07:53.660]  I have her Facebook comment.
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.660]  I'd have to read to remember exactly what she said, but I think she's also disabled.
[07:56.660 --> 07:59.660]  So we're going to have to build her something that's not heavy, that's not a lot of work.
[07:59.660 --> 08:00.660]  I have an idea.
[08:00.660 --> 08:01.660]  That's accessible.
[08:01.660 --> 08:09.660]  And I want to build a PVC frame and then wrap it in some sort of Mylar type thing, and then maybe hang a small T5 light in there.
[08:09.660 --> 08:10.660]  And that'll get her going.
[08:10.660 --> 08:11.660]  We'll talk more about that.
[08:11.660 --> 08:16.660]  We'll get that going once we get into the building the grow stuff a little more.
[08:16.660 --> 08:18.660]  Let's talk about building grows.
[08:18.660 --> 08:24.660]  There's a few things to consider when you're going to plan your grow before you even go to the hardware store, before you ever go to the hydro shop.
[08:24.660 --> 08:26.660]  There's stuff you got to think about.
[08:26.660 --> 08:31.660]  The first thing to think about, in my opinion, is is it legal where you are?
[08:31.660 --> 08:33.660]  I'm not going to help you break the law.
[08:33.660 --> 08:40.660]  The first part of this is move to a location where cannabis is legal if you want to follow my rules.
[08:40.660 --> 08:42.660]  So don't do this in an illegal state.
[08:42.660 --> 08:51.660]  Move to Colorado, go to California, or even better, do what you can to get cannabis legalized or decriminalized where you are so that you can grow legally.
[08:51.660 --> 08:53.660]  I don't want to be responsible for you breaking the law.
[08:53.660 --> 08:56.660]  So if you plan on breaking the law, just change to another podcast.
[08:56.660 --> 08:58.660]  All right.
[08:58.660 --> 09:02.660]  Sorry, I don't want you to go to jail for what I'm telling you.
[09:02.660 --> 09:04.660]  But you're going to do what you're going to do.
[09:04.660 --> 09:07.660]  So the next thing to think about, understand the risk you're taking.
[09:07.660 --> 09:13.660]  Because if you're growing in a state that's not legal, the consequences can be quite severe.
[09:13.660 --> 09:15.660]  It's not just you you're putting at risk.
[09:15.660 --> 09:18.660]  If you're growing in a house, everybody in that house is in trouble.
[09:18.660 --> 09:23.660]  If you have a family and you go to jail, that's going to just cause a tidal wave of bullshit in your life.
[09:23.660 --> 09:25.660]  So keep that in mind.
[09:25.660 --> 09:28.660]  The next thing that I would say to think about is what are your realistic needs?
[09:28.660 --> 09:31.660]  If you're committed, you're going to grow some cannabis for yourself.
[09:31.660 --> 09:32.660]  What are your realistic needs?
[09:32.660 --> 09:39.660]  Do you need to grow for yourself, your family, maybe a few patients, or are you trying to become the next big production facility in your area?
[09:39.660 --> 09:45.660]  So my next idea would be set a goal and kind of stick with that for a few cycles to see what you're doing.
[09:46.660 --> 09:49.660]  You're not going to know how good of a grower or what kind of crop you get on the first grow.
[09:49.660 --> 09:55.660]  Stick with that. Set something up. Stick with it for a couple of cycles and then adjust to your needs after you've gone a couple rounds.
[09:55.660 --> 09:59.660]  Don't run your first lap and then think my shoes are too tight, my shoes are too loose.
[09:59.660 --> 10:02.660]  Run a couple laps, see what you're good at, then adjust.
[10:02.660 --> 10:09.660]  So my next thing to consider, I would say, is does your location have viable electricity?
[10:09.660 --> 10:13.660]  This is something Jesse really stressed on when he got here to talk about this.
[10:13.660 --> 10:19.660]  Running more than one or two thousand watt lights in a room may require some electrical upgrades if you want to be safe.
[10:19.660 --> 10:24.660]  If your breakers are flipping and you're scrambling to keep everything running, that's when you're creating a fire hazard.
[10:24.660 --> 10:28.660]  And you don't want to be on the news for burning down your house growing weed.
[10:28.660 --> 10:29.660]  No.
[10:29.660 --> 10:40.660]  In your experience, can you usually just run like a thousand watt light, the blower that it requires, and a couple of fans, and if you have like a hydro bubbler or whatever, is that pretty much what one room can do?
[10:40.660 --> 10:44.660]  Yeah, most residential rooms have about 30 amps.
[10:44.660 --> 10:45.660]  A 30 amp breaker.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.660]  Yeah.
[10:46.660 --> 10:49.660]  And if you're putting an air conditioner in there, you're taking up half a breaker just with that.
[10:49.660 --> 10:52.660]  The light takes up about half a breaker.
[10:52.660 --> 10:58.660]  If you're flipping the breaker when you turn on the dishwasher or whatever, have an electrician come and help you out.
[10:58.660 --> 10:59.660]  There are a lot of electricians.
[10:59.660 --> 11:04.660]  Actually, if you're in the Pueblo area, I have an electrician that I will refer because he's looking for some work.
[11:04.660 --> 11:07.660]  He's off and he could use your job.
[11:07.660 --> 11:09.660]  So don't burn down the house, please.
[11:09.660 --> 11:10.660]  Please don't burn down the house.
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.660]  Don't create that fire hazard with electricity.
[11:12.660 --> 11:18.660]  Also, if you're in an illegal state, this is something I just thought of, you're going to have to have an excuse for all that electricity.
[11:18.660 --> 11:29.660]  If your 1,000 watt light is going to kick your light bill up about $100 per month, an additional like the light and the fan and the blower it takes to run it, you're looking about another $100 every month.
[11:30.660 --> 11:35.660]  If you're just a dude in an apartment or something like that, that may spark some concerns.
[11:35.660 --> 11:36.660]  You might want to get a hot tub.
[11:36.660 --> 11:39.660]  We've heard of people using welding equipment.
[11:39.660 --> 11:42.660]  Just get something to kind of make it look like you're doing something.
[11:42.660 --> 11:45.660]  Put a bunch of table saws in the garage if you've got that option.
[11:45.660 --> 11:47.660]  Look like you have somewhere for that power consumption to go.
[11:47.660 --> 11:50.660]  Empty saltwater fish tanks.
[11:50.660 --> 11:58.660]  But all of that stuff, I bet you they can tell that my timers are on 12-12 over at the grow.
[11:58.660 --> 12:01.660]  They're like, oh yeah, every day at 8 o'clock, this guy kicks on thousands of watts.
[12:01.660 --> 12:04.660]  And then every day at 8 o'clock, they kick off.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.660]  They're not retarded.
[12:05.660 --> 12:07.660]  Sorry if retarded is an offensive word to you.
[12:07.660 --> 12:12.660]  So, will you be able to ventilate your space is the next thing I would think about.
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.660]  Fresh air is super important.
[12:14.660 --> 12:18.660]  Stale, stagnant, humid air is the number one cause for powdery mildew.
[12:18.660 --> 12:19.660]  It'll also slow your growth.
[12:19.660 --> 12:20.660]  It makes your plants look ugly.
[12:20.660 --> 12:21.660]  It makes your room stink.
[12:21.660 --> 12:25.660]  You want to be able to walk into your grow room and close your eyes and not smell pot.
[12:25.660 --> 12:27.660]  You want it to smell like a nice, clean room.
[12:27.660 --> 12:29.660]  So, keep that in mind.
[12:29.660 --> 12:31.660]  You have to be able to ventilate that space.
[12:31.660 --> 12:34.660]  Number five on my list of things that you should consider.
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.660]  Is your grow space safe and secure?
[12:36.660 --> 12:40.660]  You may need to hide your grow from the landlord or your nosy in-laws that come over for dinner.
[12:40.660 --> 12:43.660]  Are you ready to live the grow life in your house?
[12:43.660 --> 12:47.660]  That doesn't sound like a huge question, but dude, when you've got pot plants in your house,
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.660]  your whole house will stink if you don't have it under control.
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.660]  You might need some carbon filters.
[12:52.660 --> 12:54.660]  You might need an extra carbon filter or two.
[12:55.660 --> 12:59.660]  I always have a carbon filter on the air that is going out the exhaust.
[12:59.660 --> 13:05.660]  But then also, I'll hang a carbon filter with a blower on it just right in the middle of the room on the ceiling to act as a scrubber.
[13:05.660 --> 13:08.660]  Just to clean even more air and that eliminates more odor.
[13:08.660 --> 13:10.660]  We were talking about Ona gel last night.
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.660]  They sell Ona gels in like a plastic jar.
[13:14.660 --> 13:17.660]  They say to take the lid off and just leave it sitting.
[13:17.660 --> 13:23.660]  But I actually poke little pencil-sized holes with the drill right in the lid and then just let it sit.
[13:23.660 --> 13:28.660]  Once it gets down to about a third of the jar, I just add like a half a cup of water in there and shake it.
[13:28.660 --> 13:31.660]  It rehydrates all the crystals and it lasts a little longer.
[13:31.660 --> 13:36.660]  Put those by your door, like your entryway to your home or entryway to wherever you're growing.
[13:36.660 --> 13:38.660]  People's nose will hit that first.
[13:38.660 --> 13:42.660]  Now their nose has already been punched, so they're confused.
[13:42.660 --> 13:45.660]  When they smell the herb, they won't know that it's herb, hopefully.
[13:45.660 --> 13:47.660]  You can put them inside your ducting too.
[13:47.660 --> 13:49.660]  Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
[13:49.660 --> 13:52.660]  There you go. It'll move that odor around instead of the cannabis odor.
[13:52.660 --> 13:54.660]  I'm going to add a random side note.
[13:54.660 --> 13:57.660]  This is just a really random sidebar because I just thought about it.
[13:57.660 --> 13:59.660]  I keep hearing a lot of people say the word marijuana.
[13:59.660 --> 14:01.660]  Marijuana is a racist word and it sounds bad.
[14:01.660 --> 14:03.660]  People are afraid of marijuana.
[14:03.660 --> 14:05.660]  Cannabis is the new word.
[14:05.660 --> 14:07.660]  Cannabis sounds better.
[14:07.660 --> 14:09.660]  It doesn't sound as racist.
[14:09.660 --> 14:13.660]  I know that's a weird way to put it, but we were taught that marijuana is the devil.
[14:13.660 --> 14:17.660]  If you smoke marijuana, you're going to get crazy and rape white bitches.
[14:17.660 --> 14:18.660]  Cannabis will heal you.
[14:18.660 --> 14:20.660]  Cannabis stops cancer.
[14:21.660 --> 14:25.660]  I think we should just try to abandon the word marijuana and say cannabis a lot more.
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.660]  That's just my random sidebar for the day.
[14:27.660 --> 14:30.660]  Marijuana actually literally is a racist word.
[14:30.660 --> 14:34.660]  Don't doubt that, people.
[14:34.660 --> 14:39.660]  It was invented by the government to discriminate against Mexicans.
[14:39.660 --> 14:40.660]  That's a huge history lesson.
[14:40.660 --> 14:43.660]  They didn't like the Mexicans that were coming to America and smoking marijuanas
[14:43.660 --> 14:45.660]  and then bringing it to the jazz musicians.
[14:45.660 --> 14:47.660]  That's all reefer madness, you guys.
[14:47.660 --> 14:48.660]  Hopefully you know about that already.
[14:48.660 --> 14:51.660]  Hopefully you're not that brainwashed and you never paid attention to that.
[14:51.660 --> 14:53.660]  Hopefully you just call it cannabis.
[14:53.660 --> 14:54.660]  All right.
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.660]  Safe and secure grow space, living the grow life.
[14:56.660 --> 15:00.660]  Another big thing to consider is the location of your grow inside of your house
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.660]  or wherever you're doing it.
[15:02.660 --> 15:04.660]  The basement is generally the coolest spot.
[15:04.660 --> 15:07.660]  You're insulated by dirt and concrete walls and you're underground.
[15:07.660 --> 15:10.660]  You don't get a lot of climate changes there in the basement.
[15:10.660 --> 15:13.660]  Also, hopefully you don't get a lot of traffic down there in the basement.
[15:13.660 --> 15:15.660]  You got like one room in the corner in the back or something.
[15:15.660 --> 15:17.660]  You can just dedicate.
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.660]  The attic is going to get hot.
[15:19.660 --> 15:20.660]  The attic is the top of the house.
[15:20.660 --> 15:23.660]  It's getting hit by the sun.
[15:23.660 --> 15:26.660]  You don't have all this insulation from the dirt and the concrete walls.
[15:26.660 --> 15:28.660]  The attic is going to be a little more challenging,
[15:28.660 --> 15:30.660]  so you're going to need more cooling power.
[15:30.660 --> 15:32.660]  You're going to have to adjust.
[15:32.660 --> 15:36.660]  Your snow melts off the roof in the middle of the winter,
[15:36.660 --> 15:38.660]  and it's the only house in the neighborhood.
[15:38.660 --> 15:41.660]  You're the only house that your roof is clean because you just melt.
[15:42.660 --> 15:45.660]  I've had to make an adjustment because I noticed that I was melting snow
[15:45.660 --> 15:46.660]  somewhere one year.
[15:46.660 --> 15:48.660]  I was like, oh, that's obvious as shit.
[15:48.660 --> 15:51.660]  Also, guys, this is something we'll cover a little later,
[15:51.660 --> 15:52.660]  but I want to jump to it.
[15:52.660 --> 15:54.660]  You're going to have to get water there.
[15:54.660 --> 15:56.660]  Putting your plants in the attic,
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.660]  once you get all the grow equipment hung up up there and everything's up
[15:59.660 --> 16:01.660]  there, now you have to get water up there often.
[16:01.660 --> 16:03.660]  Keep that in mind.
[16:03.660 --> 16:06.660]  Then another, go ahead, you got something to add.
[16:06.660 --> 16:09.660]  Attics, if you can avoid it, it's just really not a good place to grow.
[16:09.660 --> 16:12.660]  It's actually a pretty good fire hazard.
[16:12.660 --> 16:17.660]  It's a significant fire hazard.
[16:17.660 --> 16:21.660]  Avoid the attic at all costs.
[16:21.660 --> 16:23.660]  If you're in Wisconsin or something, though,
[16:23.660 --> 16:26.660]  and you can't really do it like we can here in Colorado,
[16:26.660 --> 16:28.660]  nobody goes to anybody else's attic.
[16:28.660 --> 16:30.660]  That may be someone's only option.
[16:30.660 --> 16:31.660]  For sure.
[16:31.660 --> 16:33.660]  Guys, like we were talking about earlier, be safe.
[16:33.660 --> 16:36.660]  I know this sounds cheesy as hell, but safety first, bro.
[16:37.660 --> 16:39.660]  You don't want to be on the news for burning down your house,
[16:39.660 --> 16:41.660]  growing pot, because when the news comes,
[16:41.660 --> 16:44.660]  you might've been growing legal medical cannabis,
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.660]  but as soon as that fire starts and the news truck pulls out,
[16:46.660 --> 16:47.660]  you've got a drug lab.
[16:47.660 --> 16:48.660]  Yeah.
[16:48.660 --> 16:50.660]  They're not going to be polite.
[16:50.660 --> 16:54.660]  This, this medical marijuana provider accidentally sparked fire to his home.
[16:54.660 --> 16:55.660]  Now the report's going to say,
[16:55.660 --> 16:58.660]  we're here in front of this house where there's a major drug lab on fire
[16:58.660 --> 16:59.660]  right now.
[16:59.660 --> 17:01.660]  That's what the reports and you're going to be the asshole that just went to
[17:01.660 --> 17:02.660]  jail for doing that.
[17:02.660 --> 17:04.660]  That was a nice news voice.
[17:04.660 --> 17:05.660]  You like that?
[17:05.660 --> 17:06.660]  Yeah.
[17:06.660 --> 17:08.660]  It sounded really weird in the headphones.
[17:08.660 --> 17:09.660]  I had to bail on it kind of quickly.
[17:09.660 --> 17:12.660]  So yeah,
[17:12.660 --> 17:13.660]  try to go lower in the house is better.
[17:13.660 --> 17:16.660]  In Pueblo,
[17:16.660 --> 17:19.660]  they're trying to actually push and push an ordinance where we have to grow
[17:19.660 --> 17:20.660]  in an outbuilding.
[17:20.660 --> 17:23.660]  And I was reading a book doing research on this and in Jorge Cervantes book,
[17:23.660 --> 17:24.660]  he says,
[17:24.660 --> 17:27.660]  outbuildings are actually the worst place you could think about growing
[17:27.660 --> 17:29.660]  because that's where thieves are.
[17:29.660 --> 17:31.660]  And the cops don't consider that trespassing.
[17:31.660 --> 17:33.660]  So they can go into your outbuilding.
[17:33.660 --> 17:34.660]  It's not part of your home.
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.660]  Oh,
[17:35.660 --> 17:36.660]  nice.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.660]  Yeah.
[17:37.660 --> 17:38.660]  So the cops can walk right in.
[17:38.660 --> 17:39.660]  That's not,
[17:39.660 --> 17:40.660]  it's a different rule.
[17:40.660 --> 17:41.660]  You know,
[17:41.660 --> 17:42.660]  it's not part of your domicile.
[17:42.660 --> 17:43.660]  It's a shed.
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.660]  So they can walk right into that.
[17:44.660 --> 17:45.660]  They don't need a warrant.
[17:45.660 --> 17:47.660]  That's something we got to remind all the people that are opposed to this of
[17:47.660 --> 17:48.660]  Mike.
[17:48.660 --> 17:49.660]  Did you just hear that bro?
[17:49.660 --> 17:51.660]  You're outbuilding that they're trying to propose that we build will not be
[17:51.660 --> 17:52.660]  part of your home.
[17:52.660 --> 17:55.660]  So it will not require a warrant is what this book that Jorge Cervantes wrote
[17:55.660 --> 17:56.660]  says.
[17:56.660 --> 17:57.660]  Let me know how that really works.
[17:57.660 --> 17:59.660]  Shout out to Mike.
[17:59.660 --> 18:00.660]  He's my legal counsel.
[18:01.660 --> 18:02.660]  Grown in a shed.
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.660]  It has a lot of challenges too.
[18:04.660 --> 18:08.660]  So it's going to be a lot like growing in an attic as far as trying to
[18:08.660 --> 18:09.660]  insulate it and cool it.
[18:09.660 --> 18:10.660]  Okay.
[18:10.660 --> 18:11.660]  It's going to be very difficult.
[18:11.660 --> 18:12.660]  And I guess I should,
[18:12.660 --> 18:13.660]  one more thing.
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.660]  The next step here is how are you going to cool the room?
[18:15.660 --> 18:18.660]  Keep in mind that you have to use more electricity for that air
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.660]  conditioner and the air conditioner has to vent itself somewhere.
[18:20.660 --> 18:22.660]  So you keep in mind how you're going to cool the room.
[18:22.660 --> 18:24.660]  I had a good point that I wanted to make,
[18:24.660 --> 18:25.660]  and it just left me a little bit of a blank.
[18:25.660 --> 18:26.660]  I'm going to go ahead and say,
[18:26.660 --> 18:28.660]  keep in mind how you're going to cool the room.
[18:28.660 --> 18:30.660]  I had a good point that I wanted to make and it just left my head.
[18:30.660 --> 18:31.660]  What were you just telling me?
[18:31.660 --> 18:33.660]  What was that?
[18:33.660 --> 18:35.660]  With the sheds.
[18:35.660 --> 18:36.660]  Yeah.
[18:36.660 --> 18:37.660]  The sheds.
[18:37.660 --> 18:38.660]  Okay.
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.660]  Yeah.
[18:39.660 --> 18:40.660]  What our goal is,
[18:40.660 --> 18:42.660]  I guess I should have covered this more in the beginning,
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.660]  but your goal when you're building a grow room,
[18:44.660 --> 18:45.660]  you want as much control of the lights,
[18:45.660 --> 18:46.660]  the air,
[18:46.660 --> 18:47.660]  the water,
[18:47.660 --> 18:48.660]  the humidity,
[18:48.660 --> 18:49.660]  the temperature.
[18:49.660 --> 18:50.660]  That's what we're trying to do.
[18:50.660 --> 18:53.660]  We're trying to build a room that we can control to set the ideal climate
[18:53.660 --> 18:54.660]  for these plants.
[18:55.660 --> 18:56.660]  I guess we should,
[18:56.660 --> 18:57.660]  instead of just starting building a room,
[18:57.660 --> 18:58.660]  we should know what we're trying to build.
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.660]  That's what you want.
[18:59.660 --> 19:05.660]  You want a room that you can almost automate and let that happen and just
[19:05.660 --> 19:07.660]  turn everything on properly,
[19:07.660 --> 19:09.660]  get everything set up properly and let it run.
[19:09.660 --> 19:10.660]  Then when the nighttime comes,
[19:10.660 --> 19:12.660]  you have a nighttime temperature selected.
[19:12.660 --> 19:13.660]  It'll get to that.
[19:13.660 --> 19:14.660]  When the daytime comes again,
[19:14.660 --> 19:15.660]  you have a daytime temp selected.
[19:15.660 --> 19:17.660]  The air conditioner kicks on at the right time.
[19:17.660 --> 19:19.660]  Your fans move at the right time.
[19:19.660 --> 19:20.660]  Your blowers are all at the right schedule.
[19:21.660 --> 19:27.660]  Then you can hit that perfect 50% humidity or 40% humidity mark.
[19:27.660 --> 19:30.660]  You can get your 77 degree mark in there.
[19:30.660 --> 19:32.660]  You can get it all perfect.
[19:32.660 --> 19:34.660]  You can have just a little bit of wind.
[19:34.660 --> 19:36.660]  That's what you're trying to do.
[19:36.660 --> 19:37.660]  You're trying to build that super happy,
[19:37.660 --> 19:40.660]  trying to build an aquarium for your plants or a cage for plants,
[19:40.660 --> 19:42.660]  the perfect habitat for these plants.
[19:42.660 --> 19:44.660]  A subclimate inside your house.
[19:44.660 --> 19:45.660]  Inside your house.
[19:45.660 --> 19:46.660]  Yeah, that's your goal.
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.660]  I guess I should have talked more about that at the beginning.
[19:49.660 --> 19:53.660]  Once you achieve that pretty dialed in perfect climate,
[19:53.660 --> 19:55.660]  growing becomes a lot easier.
[19:55.660 --> 19:57.660]  A lot, lot easier.
[19:57.660 --> 20:03.660]  The room, the genetics, what you're feeding,
[20:03.660 --> 20:05.660]  and then the grow, how you grow,
[20:05.660 --> 20:07.660]  that's pretty much what your components are.
[20:07.660 --> 20:10.660]  Light air, water, soil, and love.
[20:10.660 --> 20:12.660]  Cleanliness.
[20:12.660 --> 20:14.660]  Cleanliness is next to godliness when it comes to growing.
[20:14.660 --> 20:16.660]  Every little piece of trash or scrap,
[20:17.660 --> 20:18.660]  and not just in your grow room.
[20:18.660 --> 20:23.660]  If your grow room is in your mom's basement or your grandma's attic
[20:23.660 --> 20:28.660]  or your bedroom closet, all of those clothes, all those books,
[20:28.660 --> 20:31.660]  all those scraps of paper, all those cigarette butts, all the dust,
[20:31.660 --> 20:34.660]  that's all a place for a spider mite to hide.
[20:34.660 --> 20:36.660]  That's all a place for a thrip to lay a bug.
[20:36.660 --> 20:40.660]  Also, all that dust and cigarette smoke will end up in your concentrate
[20:40.660 --> 20:42.660]  and in your flowers.
[20:43.660 --> 20:47.660]  I've stopped sweeping my grow room now after about week six
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.660]  because I don't want to stir up the dust and put it in my flowers.
[20:50.660 --> 20:53.660]  I will let my grow room look a little shitty on the floor for a week
[20:53.660 --> 20:55.660]  to not sweep it up as often.
[20:55.660 --> 20:59.660]  I'll turn off all the fans and blowers and air conditioners now to sweep up
[20:59.660 --> 21:03.660]  because I don't want that sticking to my buds because that ends up in the hash.
[21:03.660 --> 21:05.660]  We're trying to make the best hash we can now.
[21:05.660 --> 21:08.660]  That seems to be the point that everybody's headed to.
[21:08.660 --> 21:09.660]  I still try to grow the best flowers,
[21:09.660 --> 21:11.660]  but of course we want the best hash to go with that.
[21:13.660 --> 21:15.660]  All right. That was a long rant.
[21:15.660 --> 21:20.660]  Other than things to consider, there are responsibilities that I think
[21:20.660 --> 21:24.660]  you should practice being a good grower.
[21:24.660 --> 21:28.660]  When you're setting up to grow, you don't want to piss off the neighbors.
[21:28.660 --> 21:32.660]  You don't want to attract unwanted attention by thieves or thugs.
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.660]  You don't want to get cop attention.
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.660]  This is something people don't think about.
[21:36.660 --> 21:39.660]  There are kids out there that love to steal pot plants now.
[21:39.660 --> 21:40.660]  Kids are getting braver.
[21:40.660 --> 21:43.660]  The younger kids are getting dumber and braver.
[21:43.660 --> 21:44.660]  They know what pot is.
[21:44.660 --> 21:47.660]  They know how to find a grow, and they don't want to steal your shit.
[21:47.660 --> 21:48.660]  Keep the pot.
[21:48.660 --> 21:51.660]  There are also innocent kids that will just see your pot and want to steal it
[21:51.660 --> 21:52.660]  just because they're curious.
[21:52.660 --> 21:54.660]  Be careful. Keep your pot away from the kids.
[21:54.660 --> 21:58.660]  I know I stress that, but I'm a father, so I don't want my kid finding your pot.
[21:58.660 --> 22:03.830]  Sorry. I needed a drink. That was a long rant.
[22:03.830 --> 22:06.830]  Some of the responsibilities that I think,
[22:06.830 --> 22:08.830]  and I want to thank my friends on Facebook for helping me out.
[22:08.830 --> 22:11.830]  I asked for a couple of pieces of advice on this topic
[22:11.830 --> 22:12.830]  and a few people chimed in.
[22:12.830 --> 22:15.830]  I owe a huge shout out to Mr. Chris Barkowitz.
[22:15.830 --> 22:18.830]  If you guys know Chris Barkowitz, you'll know why this is funny.
[22:18.830 --> 22:20.830]  You can Google his name if you want.
[22:20.830 --> 22:23.830]  I asked Chris Barkowitz, or I asked on Facebook,
[22:23.830 --> 22:25.830]  what would be a few things you could do to be a responsible grower
[22:25.830 --> 22:27.830]  and not get yourself in trouble?
[22:27.830 --> 22:29.830]  Chris's reply was, don't do interviews.
[22:29.830 --> 22:31.830]  Great answer. I love it.
[22:31.830 --> 22:33.830]  That's the golden answer right there.
[22:33.830 --> 22:36.830]  Chris is finally free after that interview, and welcome home, bro.
[22:36.830 --> 22:39.830]  You look good in that iRegenetics t-shirt.
[22:40.830 --> 22:42.830]  A few responsibilities being a grower.
[22:42.830 --> 22:45.830]  Make sure your lights are not visible from the outside.
[22:45.830 --> 22:48.830]  When you set up your grow room, when the sun goes down,
[22:48.830 --> 22:51.830]  turn on all your grow lights, walk outside,
[22:51.830 --> 22:54.830]  whatever, if you're in the basement, attic, bedroom,
[22:54.830 --> 22:57.830]  walk outside and see if you can see your grow lights.
[22:57.830 --> 23:00.830]  If you can see your grow lights, fix it. You're failing.
[23:00.830 --> 23:02.830]  That's the problem. That also means you have a light leak.
[23:02.830 --> 23:05.830]  Yeah, that means the lights are getting in during your flowering cycle,
[23:05.830 --> 23:08.830]  which you're just going to cause a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[23:08.830 --> 23:10.830]  Also, your next responsibility.
[23:10.830 --> 23:12.830]  Make sure the blowers and fans are not heard by neighbors
[23:12.830 --> 23:14.830]  or people walking past your grow.
[23:16.830 --> 23:19.830]  If there's a spot where you don't think people will ever walk,
[23:19.830 --> 23:21.830]  the day you build a damn grow, someone's going to walk there.
[23:21.830 --> 23:25.830]  The meter maid, the gas guy, some kid chasing his dog,
[23:25.830 --> 23:27.830]  some cop looking for someone else.
[23:27.830 --> 23:29.830]  They're going to walk right past that blower,
[23:29.830 --> 23:31.830]  and they're going to go, what is this?
[23:31.830 --> 23:33.830]  And you're going to think, no one's ever going to walk there.
[23:33.830 --> 23:35.830]  But as soon as you put a blower there, dude, they will.
[23:35.830 --> 23:37.830]  That's the way life works.
[23:37.830 --> 23:39.830]  So just be careful, plan ahead.
[23:39.830 --> 23:41.830]  Make sure no one can hear your blowers.
[23:41.830 --> 23:43.830]  Make sure no one can see your lights.
[23:43.830 --> 23:45.830]  There's ways to muffle.
[23:45.830 --> 23:48.830]  Insulating the duct, insulating the blower.
[23:48.830 --> 23:51.830]  You can disguise outlets as a dryer outlet.
[23:51.830 --> 23:54.830]  You can try to put it through the roof.
[23:54.830 --> 23:58.830]  Just move the blower to the other end of the chain so it's not so noisy.
[23:58.830 --> 24:00.830]  Not right at the window.
[24:00.830 --> 24:02.830]  Those mufflers are a great idea.
[24:02.830 --> 24:05.830]  They're actually available at a high-grow window or growing supplies.
[24:06.830 --> 24:09.830]  And actually, a cheaper alternative to the mufflers
[24:09.830 --> 24:13.830]  and better for your grow is a HEPA filter.
[24:13.830 --> 24:14.830]  Yes.
[24:14.830 --> 24:17.830]  Those will, if it's sucking in, those will help.
[24:17.830 --> 24:22.830]  Over all of my ends where I have drilled 6-inch holes or 8-inch holes
[24:22.830 --> 24:25.830]  to have my ends coming in, I get those little square HEPA filters
[24:25.830 --> 24:27.830]  that are just a sheet, I guess they're a rectangle,
[24:27.830 --> 24:30.830]  and I just staple those right over it with a staple gun onto the wall.
[24:30.830 --> 24:31.830]  For sure.
[24:31.830 --> 24:34.830]  Wherever I do a grow, yeah, that keeps your bugs out,
[24:34.830 --> 24:36.830]  all the stuff that you don't want in your hash, it keeps all that out of there.
[24:36.830 --> 24:38.830]  Filter everything twice.
[24:38.830 --> 24:40.830]  Yes, twice if you can.
[24:40.830 --> 24:43.830]  People are going, oh my God, how much is this going to cost?
[24:43.830 --> 24:46.830]  Building a good grow room does cost a little bit of money.
[24:46.830 --> 24:49.830]  People were asking last night, they're like, we've got this much budget,
[24:49.830 --> 24:52.830]  should we buy better this or better this?
[24:52.830 --> 24:56.830]  And that's kind of where I think you should get the best bulbs and ballasts you can.
[24:56.830 --> 24:57.830]  That's your first start.
[24:57.830 --> 24:59.830]  And then move your air.
[24:59.830 --> 25:02.830]  And then if you have to buy in chunks, I think you buy the lights
[25:02.830 --> 25:04.830]  and your air moving stuff, like your ducting, your blowers,
[25:04.830 --> 25:09.830]  and then your air conditioner, and then you buy your pots and soil and nutrients.
[25:09.830 --> 25:13.830]  Start with the room and just buy slowly instead of, but yeah.
[25:13.830 --> 25:17.830]  It's all about choosing where, the weakest link is always going to be the weakest link.
[25:17.830 --> 25:19.830]  It's hard to decide where to pinch your budget there.
[25:19.830 --> 25:21.830]  Get the good bulbs and good ballasts.
[25:21.830 --> 25:23.830]  That's definitely my opinion.
[25:23.830 --> 25:27.830]  So here's a big issue that we've been dealing with here in Pueblo.
[25:27.830 --> 25:31.830]  This caused a lot of, most of our new laws here that are being proposed in Pueblo
[25:31.830 --> 25:32.830]  are because of this issue.
[25:32.830 --> 25:35.830]  Make sure nobody can smell your grow.
[25:35.830 --> 25:38.830]  The smell is the most offensive and revealing part of your grow.
[25:38.830 --> 25:39.830]  Yes, I said offensive.
[25:39.830 --> 25:44.830]  There are some people that do not love the smell of sweet, sweet, sticky ganja in the morning.
[25:44.830 --> 25:46.830]  There's a guy here in our city that keeps complaining to city council
[25:46.830 --> 25:51.830]  that he can smell pot every day when he wakes up because his neighbors are growing the dank.
[25:51.830 --> 25:52.830]  Not a fan.
[25:52.830 --> 25:53.830]  Yeah.
[25:53.830 --> 25:55.830]  Keep that smell down.
[25:55.830 --> 25:58.830]  If you build your grow discreetly and you don't bring attention to yourself,
[25:58.830 --> 26:01.830]  your neighbors will never know you've got a grow in your home.
[26:01.830 --> 26:03.830]  It's a security issue too.
[26:03.830 --> 26:09.830]  Being able to, I mean, don't, that's just inviting people in, man.
[26:09.830 --> 26:10.830]  Or people.
[26:10.830 --> 26:12.830]  Not only thieves, but mooches.
[26:12.830 --> 26:16.830]  You make more friends than you've ever wanted when people find out you grow weed.
[26:16.830 --> 26:18.830]  Can I get one of those buds?
[26:18.830 --> 26:19.830]  No, dude.
[26:19.830 --> 26:20.830]  What are you talking about, man?
[26:20.830 --> 26:21.830]  What buds?
[26:21.830 --> 26:22.830]  There's a dead skunk in my backyard.
[26:22.830 --> 26:23.830]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[26:23.830 --> 26:26.830]  Fucking dog got sprayed again.
[26:27.830 --> 26:32.830]  Several years ago, I lived in another house and I had a grow in the basement there.
[26:32.830 --> 26:37.830]  The power went out and I was mid-flower, so it stinks, dude.
[26:37.830 --> 26:42.830]  The power guys had to come through everybody's backyard looking for the problem.
[26:42.830 --> 26:45.830]  I wasn't at the place, but my girlfriend was there.
[26:45.830 --> 26:47.830]  The power guy told my girlfriend,
[26:47.830 --> 26:51.830]  ma'am, I'd go in the house, it smells like you've got a skunk in the backyard.
[26:51.830 --> 26:55.830]  He could smell my grow completely.
[26:55.830 --> 26:58.830]  She just made a cringing face and went in the house and told me about it later.
[26:58.830 --> 27:02.830]  People can smell your, even if you can't smell it, people can smell your grow.
[27:02.830 --> 27:03.830]  You're around it.
[27:03.830 --> 27:04.830]  You sleep by it.
[27:04.830 --> 27:05.830]  You're in there.
[27:05.830 --> 27:06.830]  You wake up.
[27:06.830 --> 27:07.830]  You're smoking it.
[27:07.830 --> 27:10.830]  You're the last person that's going to smell it.
[27:10.830 --> 27:14.830]  Yeah, the church lady down the block can smell it down the street.
[27:14.830 --> 27:15.830]  Don't let anybody smell your grow.
[27:15.830 --> 27:19.830]  Here's step number four to be a good, responsible grower when you're building a grow room.
[27:19.830 --> 27:22.830]  Do whatever it takes to make sure no kids ever get into your grow space.
[27:22.830 --> 27:24.830]  I stuttered when I said that because I mean it.
[27:24.830 --> 27:26.830]  Make sure no kids ever get into your grow space.
[27:26.830 --> 27:28.830]  That's important.
[27:28.830 --> 27:33.830]  That's like the biggest black eye you can put on the cannabis community right now is letting kids get caught with your weed.
[27:33.830 --> 27:34.830]  Yeah.
[27:34.830 --> 27:35.830]  Here's something you might not think about.
[27:35.830 --> 27:39.830]  Most of the stuff was kind of obvious, but here's a good one.
[27:39.830 --> 27:41.830]  You're going to create a lot of waste growing plants in your house.
[27:41.830 --> 27:42.830]  You're going to have soil.
[27:42.830 --> 27:44.830]  You're going to have plant stems and stalks.
[27:44.830 --> 27:45.830]  You're going to have root balls.
[27:45.830 --> 27:49.830]  Find a responsible way to dispose of everything.
[27:49.830 --> 27:51.830]  Some of you guys live out in the rural areas.
[27:51.830 --> 27:53.830]  Burn that shit if you can.
[27:54.830 --> 27:55.830]  Compost it.
[27:55.830 --> 27:56.830]  Compost it if you can.
[27:56.830 --> 28:07.830]  Yeah, but see I live in the city and my grow is in a city facility, and so it's all got to be chopped up into little tiny pieces and put into secured trash bags, and it's got to be destroyed on site.
[28:07.830 --> 28:14.830]  So, you other guys, you're going to have to find what if the trash guy is dumping your trash and finds all your pot leaves in Connecticut when you're growing pot?
[28:14.830 --> 28:15.830]  What if he's not cool?
[28:15.830 --> 28:16.830]  What if he is cool?
[28:16.830 --> 28:18.830]  Then he's going to want your weed and he's going to rob you.
[28:18.830 --> 28:20.830]  If he's not cool, he's calling the cops.
[28:20.830 --> 28:21.830]  So be careful.
[28:22.830 --> 28:23.830]  They might find your trash.
[28:23.830 --> 28:36.830]  They cannot, from Jorge's book that I read, they cannot start a case based on your trash that does not justify a search warrant, but the trash can be used in court as part of the case.
[28:36.830 --> 28:38.830]  So, keep an eye on the trash.
[28:38.830 --> 28:39.830]  Evidence.
[28:39.830 --> 28:40.830]  Physical evidence.
[28:40.830 --> 28:41.830]  I actually know people.
[28:41.830 --> 28:47.830]  I lived in Lawrence, Kansas, and now that I think about it, I know people that got busted and had their trash used as evidence in court.
[28:48.830 --> 28:51.830]  I can't remember their names, but a couple of kids I worked at a place with.
[28:51.830 --> 28:52.830]  What's up, guys?
[28:52.830 --> 28:57.830]  I've heard that for drug dealing cases back in the day and stuff.
[28:57.830 --> 29:00.830]  Find that tape they wrap around the packaging?
[29:00.830 --> 29:02.830]  I had that happen to a friend, too.
[29:02.830 --> 29:10.830]  I worked at a bowling alley, and I found a bunch of that tape, that dark colored tape, and you could tell it was wrapped around like a – I've seen plenty of pounds of weed, like brick pounds of weed.
[29:10.830 --> 29:14.830]  I don't know if it was wrapped around weed or some cocaine or something, but it was that kind of tape, and I know exactly.
[29:14.830 --> 29:18.830]  Somebody had a nice bulk of something in my bowling alley one night.
[29:18.830 --> 29:19.830]  Wow.
[29:19.830 --> 29:21.830]  You found that in the trash at the bowling alley?
[29:21.830 --> 29:23.830]  In the trash in the bathroom, just sitting on the top.
[29:23.830 --> 29:27.830]  So, you're telling me that someone at evidence lockup may have been crooked?
[29:27.830 --> 29:29.830]  No, not the evidence tape.
[29:29.830 --> 29:30.830]  Oh, oh, oh.
[29:30.830 --> 29:32.830]  That would be a lot cooler.
[29:32.830 --> 29:34.830]  You know that brown tape they wrap the kilos with?
[29:34.830 --> 29:35.830]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:35.830 --> 29:36.830]  It was a bunch of that.
[29:36.830 --> 29:37.830]  Gotcha.
[29:37.830 --> 29:43.830]  You know, a kilo of coke or a pound of weed in the bowling alley, which isn't really surprising now that I'm thinking about it.
[29:43.830 --> 29:44.830]  Oh, yeah.
[29:44.830 --> 29:47.830]  Bowling alleys are kind of sketchy places that people don't think about.
[29:47.830 --> 29:49.830]  So, think about what you guys are going to do with your trash.
[29:49.830 --> 29:53.830]  Guys, you've got a bunch of shit that you're going to have to throw away and not look obvious with it.
[29:53.830 --> 29:59.830]  If you've got more than two lights, when you harvest four lights worth of stuff, three lights worth of stuff, that's a lot of trash to take care of.
[29:59.830 --> 30:04.830]  And if you don't know what to do, if you don't know how to recycle and compost your soil, you've got soil to deal with, too.
[30:04.830 --> 30:06.830]  It's got perlite in it.
[30:06.830 --> 30:07.830]  It's got old nutrients in it.
[30:07.830 --> 30:08.830]  You've got to be careful.
[30:09.830 --> 30:10.830]  Here's another one.
[30:10.830 --> 30:12.830]  Keep your yard and house clean and presentable.
[30:12.830 --> 30:16.830]  Don't give your neighbors or anyone in the neighborhood a reason to dislike you.
[30:16.830 --> 30:17.830]  Don't stand out.
[30:17.830 --> 30:21.830]  If the house is on your block, get the lawn mowed once a week.
[30:21.830 --> 30:22.830]  Go mow the lawn once a week.
[30:22.830 --> 30:28.830]  If they've got flowers growing outside and it's a bunch of yuppies, look like a bunch of yuppies and grow flowers outside, dude.
[30:28.830 --> 30:30.830]  Try to fit in the best you can.
[30:31.830 --> 30:34.830]  Just don't be the neighborhood asshole if you're going to grow cannabis.
[30:34.830 --> 30:35.830]  Help out.
[30:35.830 --> 30:40.830]  When it snows, shovel the extra house next door on each side of you.
[30:40.830 --> 30:42.830]  Just do what you can to kind of be friendly.
[30:42.830 --> 30:49.830]  A friend of mine, Amanda, on Facebook said she actually just moved into a new house and she's building her grow in there in a legal state so I can talk about her.
[30:49.830 --> 30:53.830]  She said she walked to her neighbors on either side and introduced herself and said,
[30:54.830 --> 30:55.830]  I'm the new neighbor.
[30:55.830 --> 30:56.830]  Here's my phone number.
[30:56.830 --> 30:58.830]  If you ever have any problems, feel free to call me.
[30:58.830 --> 31:00.830]  If you guys ever want to hang out, just let me know.
[31:00.830 --> 31:03.830]  So by making friends and giving them her number, she's done two things.
[31:03.830 --> 31:06.830]  If they get pissed off at her, they won't call the cops.
[31:06.830 --> 31:10.830]  They'll call her or they'll come over and be like, hey, dude, your Grateful Dead music's too damn loud.
[31:10.830 --> 31:12.830]  Can you hippies chill out with the drum circle in here?
[31:12.830 --> 31:13.830]  Sorry, Amanda.
[31:13.830 --> 31:14.830]  I hope you're listening to that.
[31:14.830 --> 31:16.830]  And then she'll stop, you know.
[31:16.830 --> 31:20.830]  And then also if something's wrong, they don't have to call 911.
[31:20.830 --> 31:23.830]  They can call her and be like, your house is glowing.
[31:23.830 --> 31:25.830]  Like there's a bunch of light coming from the basement window.
[31:25.830 --> 31:26.830]  Your curtain fell.
[31:26.830 --> 31:27.830]  What's happening?
[31:27.830 --> 31:28.830]  They don't have to get to the cops right away.
[31:28.830 --> 31:30.830]  So just be a good neighbor.
[31:30.830 --> 31:31.830]  Introduce yourself.
[31:31.830 --> 31:32.830]  Make friends.
[31:32.830 --> 31:33.830]  Be social.
[31:33.830 --> 31:34.830]  That's my point.
[31:34.830 --> 31:36.830]  Number seven, we've talked about this.
[31:36.830 --> 31:40.830]  Don't burn the place down and make us all look like assholes.
[31:40.830 --> 31:42.830]  This cannabis revolution is new.
[31:42.830 --> 31:44.830]  There are tons of people who hate the movement.
[31:44.830 --> 31:46.830]  Fox News hates us.
[31:46.830 --> 31:50.830]  Anytime some dipshit burns down a house by blasting in doors or overpowering his breaker box,
[31:50.830 --> 31:52.830]  it makes the entire movement look stupid.
[31:52.830 --> 31:55.830]  So please, guys, don't be the asshole we see on Fox News.
[31:55.830 --> 31:59.830]  Like I said earlier, they're not going to say this medical marijuana provider had a snafu.
[31:59.830 --> 32:02.830]  They're going to say this drug lab erupted in flames.
[32:02.830 --> 32:06.830]  And you're going to be on the news in handcuffs in the back of a cop car looking like a dipshit.
[32:06.830 --> 32:08.830]  Please don't be that guy.
[32:08.830 --> 32:09.830]  Please.
[32:09.830 --> 32:12.830]  And there's no reason to.
[32:12.830 --> 32:14.830]  Grow equipment is pretty cheap nowadays.
[32:14.830 --> 32:17.830]  Don't use some sketchy asshole shit.
[32:17.830 --> 32:22.830]  If you're running a bunch of lights, get yourself a power box, plug it into the 240, and plug all the lights into that,
[32:22.830 --> 32:23.830]  and you're pretty much legit.
[32:23.830 --> 32:25.830]  You can run like eight lights on that thing.
[32:25.830 --> 32:27.830]  I think you can run nine or 12.
[32:27.830 --> 32:30.830]  I've seen like 16 light ones.
[32:30.830 --> 32:36.830]  But, yeah, if you know, and electrical upgrades aren't really that expensive.
[32:36.830 --> 32:40.830]  So if you're going nuts, you know, do it the right way.
[32:40.830 --> 32:42.830]  Don't run extension cords all over the damn place.
[32:42.830 --> 32:44.830]  No, each extension cord is a fire hazard.
[32:44.830 --> 32:45.830]  Each one.
[32:45.830 --> 32:48.830]  If you need electrical upgrades, guys, just call.
[32:48.830 --> 32:55.830]  Craigslist is filled with electricians that advertise that they're MMJ friendly or 420 friendly.
[32:55.830 --> 33:00.830]  Get one of those guys to come wire up your shit because when they do it, you'll be so impressed.
[33:00.830 --> 33:02.830]  It looks so cool to have your stuff.
[33:02.830 --> 33:05.830]  The first time you get a professionally wired up grow room, you got the wire going,
[33:05.830 --> 33:10.830]  like the little conduit going all the way across the room with the box every like eight feet or six feet for a plug in,
[33:10.830 --> 33:15.830]  and then like a big one big breaker box on the outside of the room that you can shut everything off
[33:15.830 --> 33:18.830]  so that you know you can work on shit and not get any electricity.
[33:18.830 --> 33:21.830]  Man, that is so sweet looking the first time you get that.
[33:21.830 --> 33:23.830]  So have a pro come do that.
[33:23.830 --> 33:25.830]  Find them on Craigslist if you need to.
[33:25.830 --> 33:29.830]  If you're in the southern Colorado area, I've got a guy, I got two guys for you.
[33:29.830 --> 33:33.830]  So if this first guy is busy, we can send his old boss to come help you out.
[33:33.830 --> 33:37.830]  Yeah, don't bring the shit down.
[33:37.830 --> 33:38.830]  That's what we're talking about.
[33:38.830 --> 33:40.830]  There's no reason for it.
[33:40.830 --> 33:45.830]  That should be one of the number one things when you're setting up a grow room.
[33:45.830 --> 33:49.830]  Guys, I always add a fire extinguisher and a smoke alarm.
[33:49.830 --> 33:51.830]  Put a smoke detector in the grow rooms.
[33:51.830 --> 33:53.830]  Put it near the exhaust fan.
[33:53.830 --> 33:59.830]  Like if you've got a carbon filter sucking air out, put it near there because the smoke is going to get sucked toward that.
[33:59.830 --> 34:01.830]  That way, put the smoke alarm there.
[34:01.830 --> 34:07.830]  I put a fire extinguisher outside of the damn grow room because you don't want to have to run in there and get the extinguisher
[34:07.830 --> 34:08.830]  if that room is on fire.
[34:08.830 --> 34:12.830]  You want to be able to kick in the door and just start spraying that shit.
[34:12.830 --> 34:16.830]  At Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, you can pick up an item called the Flame Defender.
[34:16.830 --> 34:17.830]  I haven't used it.
[34:17.830 --> 34:19.830]  I've done a lot of research about it.
[34:19.830 --> 34:21.830]  I need those.
[34:21.830 --> 34:22.830]  Those look like the way to go.
[34:22.830 --> 34:24.830]  I think we're going to get ourselves set up with those.
[34:24.830 --> 34:25.830]  Yeah.
[34:25.830 --> 34:26.830]  We'll test them.
[34:26.830 --> 34:28.830]  Hopefully, we never have to test them out.
[34:28.830 --> 34:30.830]  Hopefully, we never find out how good those work.
[34:30.830 --> 34:31.830]  Yeah.
[34:31.830 --> 34:32.830]  All right.
[34:32.830 --> 34:38.830]  Guys, once you've figured out how much herb you need to produce, that's when you can start designing your grow space.
[34:38.830 --> 34:41.830]  Actually, sometimes your space dictates how you build your grow.
[34:41.830 --> 34:45.830]  That's where the fun kicks in, in my opinion.
[34:45.830 --> 34:48.830]  Building a grow is all about adapting to the space you're provided.
[34:48.830 --> 34:50.830]  Some of you guys are going to use a small closet.
[34:50.830 --> 34:52.830]  Some of you might use a spare bedroom.
[34:52.830 --> 34:54.830]  Some of you guys are going to buy a grow hut and set that up.
[34:54.830 --> 34:56.830]  I will do a lot of talking about a grow hut.
[34:56.830 --> 34:57.830]  Maybe not on this episode.
[34:57.830 --> 34:59.830]  We're already 35 minutes in.
[34:59.830 --> 35:00.830]  But I will definitely.
[35:00.830 --> 35:01.830]  I'm writing that down.
[35:01.830 --> 35:02.830]  Grow hut.
[35:02.830 --> 35:03.830]  They're very versatile.
[35:03.830 --> 35:04.830]  Yeah.
[35:04.830 --> 35:07.830]  A lot of people made fun of them at first.
[35:07.830 --> 35:09.830]  But I have done some breeding.
[35:09.830 --> 35:10.830]  I've done some phenoselection.
[35:10.830 --> 35:13.830]  I've done some great growing in just a grow hut.
[35:13.830 --> 35:15.830]  They're great if you have limited space.
[35:15.830 --> 35:18.830]  You can put it in the corner of your bedroom, and it's awesome.
[35:18.830 --> 35:24.830]  I've seen a whole bedroom full of them that was quite the little production area.
[35:24.830 --> 35:26.830]  It's pretty neat.
[35:27.830 --> 35:31.830]  Since I'm only allowed a small plant count here in Pueblo in my house,
[35:31.830 --> 35:39.830]  in a spare bedroom, I run two 5x5 hydro huts on a flip box with a 600-watt light in each hut.
[35:39.830 --> 35:41.830]  But what happens, I run one ballast.
[35:41.830 --> 35:44.830]  The ballast plugs into the wall on a timer.
[35:44.830 --> 35:48.830]  So it goes ballast, and then there's a cord that goes to the flip box.
[35:48.830 --> 35:52.830]  And then the flip box has two cords that come out, and a bulb comes from each one.
[35:52.830 --> 35:55.830]  And every 12 hours, side A lights up.
[35:55.830 --> 35:59.830]  And then for 12 hours, it stays on, and then it shuts off, and the other side comes on for 12 hours.
[35:59.830 --> 36:05.830]  So instead of adding electrical upgrades to that bedroom that I'm just using in the winter as a grow space,
[36:05.830 --> 36:07.830]  it keeps the house warm up here, actually.
[36:07.830 --> 36:09.830]  So I just run that.
[36:09.830 --> 36:14.830]  Using the flip box, I can use that room all the time and have it flowering constantly
[36:14.830 --> 36:16.830]  and not have any downtime in that room.
[36:16.830 --> 36:17.830]  Nice.
[36:17.830 --> 36:23.830]  Yeah, so it's like a 14x9 room, so those two 5x5 huts fit perfectly in there.
[36:23.830 --> 36:26.830]  It gives me a little bit of room to work because I really like the grow huts.
[36:26.830 --> 36:28.830]  A lot of people talk shit about them and hate on them.
[36:28.830 --> 36:29.830]  They're amazing.
[36:29.830 --> 36:32.830]  That's my friend that was doing it.
[36:32.830 --> 36:36.830]  He didn't have the flip box, but he had two different ballasts.
[36:36.830 --> 36:40.830]  So one was on for 12 hours, and the other was on for 12 hours.
[36:40.830 --> 36:42.830]  Same thing.
[36:42.830 --> 36:43.830]  He just had the extra ballast.
[36:43.830 --> 36:45.830]  I didn't want to go buy another one.
[36:45.830 --> 36:48.830]  I was like, that flip box was the price of another ballast and everything.
[36:48.830 --> 36:50.830]  So I was like, I'll just do it this way.
[36:50.830 --> 36:52.830]  And it's kind of a test idea.
[36:52.830 --> 36:56.830]  I wanted to see if I could do that on a larger scale because I've designed an 18-light room
[36:56.830 --> 37:00.830]  that's two 9-light rooms on a flip box.
[37:00.830 --> 37:05.830]  And then I actually did some research, and a guy named Eric Bixa kind of beat me to the punch
[37:05.830 --> 37:07.830]  on this room that I was trying to build.
[37:07.830 --> 37:08.830]  So it's a cool room.
[37:08.830 --> 37:09.830]  Nice.
[37:09.830 --> 37:14.830]  It's a 10x10 room with a 10x5 long room in the middle, and all of your equipment is in that middle room.
[37:14.830 --> 37:17.830]  And you cool off all of the air in the middle room, and one side sleeps,
[37:17.830 --> 37:19.830]  so you're producing CO2 in the sleeping plants.
[37:19.830 --> 37:21.830]  Guys' plants that are asleep kick off CO2.
[37:21.830 --> 37:25.830]  If you can vent that CO2 into your flower room that's awake, you can use that.
[37:25.830 --> 37:29.830]  But so, yeah, you've got one air conditioner, one set of ballast, one dehumidifier,
[37:29.830 --> 37:31.830]  and then you're just moving the air around in both rooms.
[37:31.830 --> 37:32.830]  Yeah, for sure.
[37:32.830 --> 37:33.830]  Killer idea, guys.
[37:33.830 --> 37:34.830]  We'll talk about that.
[37:34.830 --> 37:35.830]  That's a huge room.
[37:35.830 --> 37:36.830]  That's a lot of money.
[37:36.830 --> 37:38.830]  That's like a multi-thousand-dollar room.
[37:38.830 --> 37:40.830]  So some of you guys are going to grow in closets and shit.
[37:40.830 --> 37:41.830]  That's what I'm saying, right?
[37:41.830 --> 37:43.830]  Some of you guys are going to grow in grow huts.
[37:43.830 --> 37:46.830]  Some of you guys might even bust out 16 lights in a basement.
[37:46.830 --> 37:50.830]  However you do it, there will be some obstacles presented by your existing environment.
[37:50.830 --> 37:51.830]  That's how it goes.
[37:51.830 --> 37:55.830]  Unless you're building a building that's designed to be a grow space from the beginning,
[37:55.830 --> 37:57.830]  you're going to have to deal with some type of obstacles.
[37:57.830 --> 37:59.830]  That's part of the fun for me, honestly.
[37:59.830 --> 38:01.830]  Yeah, no, totally is.
[38:01.830 --> 38:06.830]  I like taking a space like a dirty basement or a funky attic or the back part of the dispensary
[38:06.830 --> 38:11.830]  and making it an amazing, sufficient grow with the space and power that I've got
[38:11.830 --> 38:14.830]  without having to do any crazy, dramatic improvements to the place.
[38:14.830 --> 38:16.830]  It's kind of a fun challenge.
[38:17.830 --> 38:20.830]  I think I... No, I don't think I know.
[38:20.830 --> 38:24.830]  I do upgrades after every single run.
[38:24.830 --> 38:27.830]  Sometimes upgrades that slow me down quite a bit.
[38:27.830 --> 38:29.830]  Yeah, I've noticed.
[38:29.830 --> 38:31.830]  You've had some downtime for a minute.
[38:31.830 --> 38:32.830]  I've heard you talking about it.
[38:32.830 --> 38:33.830]  All right.
[38:33.830 --> 38:36.830]  So let's talk about a few things that every grow will need.
[38:36.830 --> 38:40.830]  There will be more things you're going to have to add to this depending on your room and your space.
[38:40.830 --> 38:42.830]  But every room is going to need these things.
[38:42.830 --> 38:45.830]  This is mostly for just one flowering room.
[38:45.830 --> 38:50.830]  If you want to have plants vegging while your crop flowers, you're going to need a small veg room also.
[38:50.830 --> 38:56.830]  Eventually, you're going to want a mother room and a clone area and a veg area and a breeding area
[38:56.830 --> 38:59.830]  and a place for your male plants and a place to make pollen.
[38:59.830 --> 39:04.830]  And it gets ridiculous when you start doing it a whole bunch.
[39:04.830 --> 39:06.830]  But eventually, you're going to want to add more rooms.
[39:06.830 --> 39:11.830]  My advice is build slowly and plan ahead with realistic expectations.
[39:11.830 --> 39:13.830]  Don't start counting your chickens before they hatch.
[39:13.830 --> 39:19.830]  If you've got a light and you expect a pound of weed, start thinking you've got three quarters of a pound of weed and budget for that
[39:19.830 --> 39:23.830]  because you're not going to grow as great as you plan your first couple of runs.
[39:23.830 --> 39:25.830]  So make your upgrades like Jesse said.
[39:25.830 --> 39:26.830]  He makes upgrades every time.
[39:26.830 --> 39:28.830]  Kind of plan them.
[39:28.830 --> 39:31.830]  Don't go too ambitious your first couple of times.
[39:31.830 --> 39:32.830]  Be realistic about it.
[39:32.830 --> 39:33.830]  You can fail.
[39:33.830 --> 39:35.830]  Crops fail.
[39:35.830 --> 39:40.830]  Things that kill crops, spider mites, air conditioner failure.
[39:40.830 --> 39:44.830]  Air conditioner cuts out in the middle of a flower cycle and you're at work and it's 90 degrees outside.
[39:44.830 --> 39:47.830]  You're going to come home and it's going to be 108 degrees in your grow room.
[39:47.830 --> 39:49.830]  And you're going to have crispy buds.
[39:49.830 --> 39:51.830]  They're already dried and cured for you.
[39:51.830 --> 39:54.830]  That shit happens.
[39:54.830 --> 40:00.830]  If you're running a hydro setup, if one pump dies while you're at work or while you're asleep, everything can go crunchy.
[40:00.830 --> 40:02.830]  Don't get me started on that.
[40:02.830 --> 40:03.830]  It's happened.
[40:03.830 --> 40:04.830]  I know.
[40:04.830 --> 40:06.830]  We have a mutual friend that went to Las Vegas for two days.
[40:07.830 --> 40:10.830]  He was supposed to go to a wedding and didn't want to go, but he had to go.
[40:10.830 --> 40:13.830]  And there was like a five-day vacation planned, but he went for two days.
[40:13.830 --> 40:20.830]  He flew there and flew back right away and came home and his pump took a shit while he was gone and his whole 4x4 table done.
[40:20.830 --> 40:21.830]  Oh, man.
[40:21.830 --> 40:22.830]  Yeah.
[40:22.830 --> 40:34.830]  We had a double redundancy setup, you know, two pumps and a setup at a dispensary and both failed the same weekend while everyone was at the Canada's Cup.
[40:34.830 --> 40:35.830]  Oh, man.
[40:35.830 --> 40:36.830]  Yeah.
[40:36.830 --> 40:37.830]  Goodbye.
[40:37.830 --> 40:38.830]  Two tables worth of weed.
[40:38.830 --> 40:39.830]  Two whole tables.
[40:39.830 --> 40:40.830]  Cannabis.
[40:40.830 --> 40:41.830]  Yeah.
[40:41.830 --> 40:42.830]  See?
[40:42.830 --> 40:43.830]  Thank you.
[40:43.830 --> 40:44.830]  Good job.
[40:44.830 --> 40:45.830]  Yeah.
[40:45.830 --> 40:46.830]  No, I've been trying that for a while, too.
[40:46.830 --> 40:47.830]  Cannabis.
[40:47.830 --> 40:48.830]  Cannabis.
[40:48.830 --> 40:49.830]  Yeah.
[40:49.830 --> 40:50.830]  It just sounds like a better word.
[40:50.830 --> 40:51.830]  Cannabis.
[40:51.830 --> 40:52.830]  Yeah.
[40:52.830 --> 40:53.830]  Herb.
[40:53.830 --> 40:54.830]  I call it herb a lot.
[40:54.830 --> 40:55.830]  It's a Rasta in me.
[40:55.830 --> 40:56.830]  It's a good herb.
[40:56.830 --> 40:57.830]  Yeah.
[40:57.830 --> 40:58.830]  So we're talking about things that all grows need.
[40:58.830 --> 40:59.830]  Yeah.
[40:59.830 --> 41:00.830]  Every grow is going to need electricity.
[41:00.830 --> 41:01.830]  Duh.
[41:01.830 --> 41:02.830]  Right?
[41:02.830 --> 41:03.830]  Unless you're growing outside, you need electricity.
[41:03.830 --> 41:04.830]  You're going to need lights and timers.
[41:04.830 --> 41:05.830]  You're going to need a water source.
[41:05.830 --> 41:06.830]  Those are the basics that every grow will need.
[41:06.830 --> 41:07.830]  And we're at 40 minutes.
[41:07.830 --> 41:08.830]  I'm going to try to squeeze as much of this in as we can, but we might not actually even
[41:08.830 --> 41:09.830]  get to like that.
[41:09.830 --> 41:10.830]  Yeah, man.
[41:10.830 --> 41:11.830]  I mean.
[41:11.830 --> 41:12.830]  Might not get to the build part until another episode.
[41:12.830 --> 41:13.830]  Because I have another episode planned that is just, I've had news articles set aside.
[41:13.830 --> 41:14.830]  I've got a couple of things Mike and I wanted to talk about.
[41:14.830 --> 41:15.830]  It's going to kind of go between these two build episodes, I think.
[41:15.830 --> 41:16.830]  But I might put it out as like a midweek episode.
[41:16.830 --> 41:17.830]  So I think after we record here, Mike is going to be talking about the build part.
[41:17.830 --> 41:18.830]  And then I'm going to be talking about the build part.
[41:18.830 --> 41:19.830]  And then I'm going to be talking about the build part.
[41:19.930 --> 41:46.530]  And then I'll try to get Jesse back as soon as possible to talk more about building.
[41:46.530 --> 41:52.790]  tell. Yeah, we love the questions. That means we're doing our job. If we spark your thoughts,
[41:52.790 --> 41:57.430]  that means we're doing our job. Hey, LB, you asked me questions and I appreciate it. I
[41:57.430 --> 42:00.950]  hope I responded appropriately. I don't want to say your full name because I haven't gotten
[42:00.950 --> 42:04.670]  your permission, but LB, I appreciate you for listening. That's awesome.
[42:04.670 --> 42:08.390]  So lights, everybody needs lights. Lights are actually the main ingredient to your grow
[42:08.390 --> 42:13.350]  space. Lights dictate the cycles of the gardens. They tell you if you're in veg or if you're
[42:13.350 --> 42:18.770]  in flower. Lights are also the main fuel and energy provider for your plants. Lights
[42:18.770 --> 42:21.670]  create photosynthesis. Lights are the main thing.
[42:21.670 --> 42:26.630]  It's the number one nutrient. Yes. Put as big of a light as you can in your
[42:26.630 --> 42:34.110]  space is what I always say. And a lot of them. So no matter how big or small your grow space
[42:34.110 --> 42:38.470]  is, you will need some sort of air exchange system. Always. You got to get rid of that
[42:38.470 --> 42:43.870]  old stale, funky air. I can't stress how important this is. Most of the problems I
[42:43.870 --> 42:49.790]  see from low budget grows is a lack of airflow and air exchange. Moving the air around the
[42:49.790 --> 42:55.770]  room is great, but you need to replace the air in the room also. If you leave a freshly
[42:55.770 --> 42:59.670]  watered crop locked in a sealed closet with a light above it, you're creating a very humid
[42:59.670 --> 43:04.110]  environment. The plants are trying to transpire, but there's too much moisture in the air.
[43:04.110 --> 43:08.350]  The plants can't sweat like they should, which slows down photosynthesis and stunts
[43:08.350 --> 43:13.150]  growth. It also makes your plants look angry and sad too. If the plants are left in excessive
[43:13.150 --> 43:17.150]  humidity for long periods, they will become very susceptible to our good friend, powdery
[43:17.150 --> 43:25.710]  mildew. F you powdery mildew. As your buds grow, your risk of powdery mildew way increases.
[43:25.710 --> 43:28.690]  The insides of your buds, if you're not getting some airflow in there and you got too much
[43:28.690 --> 43:33.230]  moisture in the room, that mold is going to grow right in the middle of your buds.
[43:33.870 --> 43:37.510]  Lock yourself in your car one day. Just lock yourself in the car on the sun and just try
[43:37.510 --> 43:40.550]  to sit there and breathe for the whole day. That's what it feels like for your plants
[43:40.550 --> 43:42.590]  when you just stifle them locked up in a tight room.
[43:42.590 --> 43:44.830]  That's a good way to put it.
[43:44.830 --> 43:50.750]  We've stressed the need for air exchange. Water. Water should be easily accessible.
[43:50.750 --> 43:56.050]  I predict that each thousand watt light will require about five gallons of water two to
[43:56.050 --> 44:04.570]  three times a week. This works across the board. I like to put 16 three gallon pots
[44:04.570 --> 44:10.130]  under the light or I like to put nine five gallon pots or between four and six seven
[44:10.130 --> 44:15.930]  gallon pots underneath a thousand watt light. Either way, I find that that requires about
[44:15.930 --> 44:18.370]  five gallons of water for each watering.
[44:18.370 --> 44:22.450]  That's a real good estimate actually.
[44:22.450 --> 44:26.450]  I'm glad that works out. Keep that in mind that you guys are going to have to get water
[44:26.450 --> 44:32.490]  to your grow space at least twice a week unless you set up a drip system. Lay it in flour
[44:32.490 --> 44:36.570]  and if your room is a little hotter, you may be watering three or four times a week.
[44:36.570 --> 44:39.850]  I'm hitting my plants as a little cool now, so I'm hitting them Monday. I hit them with
[44:39.850 --> 44:43.730]  nutrients real heavy and then I try to hit them on Thursday or Friday with just enough
[44:43.730 --> 44:48.190]  water to keep them through Monday. Since they haven't been drinking a lot, that means that
[44:48.190 --> 44:51.610]  on their next day when they get just water, I'm going to really water the shit out of
[44:51.770 --> 44:55.370]  them to kind of wash out any excess nutrients that have built up over time and then we'll
[44:55.370 --> 45:00.610]  start refeeding the soil again around day 30. I really pummel them with a lot of sugars
[45:00.610 --> 45:01.610]  and things.
[45:01.610 --> 45:06.290]  Smaller plants will use water a lot more often too.
[45:06.290 --> 45:10.850]  That mic stand is fired after his performance tonight. We have a mic stand that needs Viagra.
[45:10.850 --> 45:14.090]  We'll swap it out for that one over there. Sorry about giving you the shitty mic stand.
[45:14.090 --> 45:15.090]  It's all good.
[45:15.090 --> 45:19.570]  I've got to talk to our sponsors about this. If you guys are interested in sponsoring the
[45:19.570 --> 45:23.610]  I Grow Culture podcast, email me. I grow culture at hotmail.com. I'd love to hear what you
[45:23.610 --> 45:26.410]  have to say. I'll send you a one sheet if that's what you're looking for. Let you know
[45:26.410 --> 45:32.370]  what my rates are. We've been hitting, dude, we've been hitting between 3000 and 5000 listeners
[45:32.370 --> 45:38.330]  per episode. 5000 is our peak. 2500 is like our low on an episode now. Jesus, that's,
[45:38.330 --> 45:41.530]  that's how many people are here in this show. So thank each and every one of you that are
[45:41.530 --> 45:45.410]  listening. That is awesome. Yeah, thank you guys. All right. I feel like we've talked
[45:45.410 --> 45:49.610]  about the very basics of building a room. We talked about setting a goal for how much
[45:49.610 --> 45:54.290]  cannabis we need to grow. I wrote herb right here, but I corrected myself. The next step
[45:54.290 --> 45:58.130]  is figuring out if you're building your room to fit your production needs, or if you're
[45:58.130 --> 46:04.490]  building the room to fit the available space, budget and electrical limitations. Sometimes
[46:04.490 --> 46:08.290]  you can't always throw 24 lights in your basement because you can't pull that many amps. So
[46:08.290 --> 46:13.530]  find a happy medium that lets you grow a few crops and then see if this is something that
[46:13.530 --> 46:17.890]  you can dedicate more time and space and electricity to. And then after a couple of
[46:17.890 --> 46:22.490]  crops, expand your grows, plant them out. But don't expand more quickly than you can
[46:22.490 --> 46:26.690]  learn. I keep saying that. Imagine this. Imagine getting ahead of yourself will cause you headaches
[46:26.690 --> 46:32.850]  in the future. Imagine if you have 24 lights and flower with six, seven gallon pots under
[46:32.850 --> 46:37.050]  each light and now you have fungus gnats and it's your first grow and you're like four
[46:37.050 --> 46:40.370]  weeks into flower and you can't spray because if you spray, you're going to put shit in
[46:40.370 --> 46:44.610]  your buds, but you've got to get rid of those fungus gnats and you got a whole lot of them.
[46:44.610 --> 46:52.370]  You just spent, if you got 24 lights, it's like 150 plants. That should be 24 to 30 pounds
[46:52.370 --> 46:55.210]  of wheat. If you do this, right? Some guys are going to get 48 pounds of weed out of
[46:55.210 --> 46:58.930]  these 24 lights. If you're running some OG kush or girl's got cookies, you're hoping
[46:58.930 --> 47:03.970]  for those 25 pounds out of that. And now you may have to cut it down four weeks in. You
[47:03.970 --> 47:08.690]  got to do it. What if you got spider mites in there? I'm cringing. So what I'm saying
[47:08.690 --> 47:13.890]  is start small, dude. Uh, fail small before you fail so large because when you grow, you're
[47:13.890 --> 47:18.890]  going to fail. Uh, I mess up at this rate. I still kill stuff on accident like all the
[47:18.890 --> 47:22.610]  time, but that's the only way I learn. I encourage a little bit of experiment. Don't experiment
[47:22.610 --> 47:27.330]  on your moms. Don't experiment on your patients. Important crop. Pick a plant, torture it,
[47:27.330 --> 47:33.330]  see what you can do to it, but go small. Like experience a few problems before you try to
[47:33.330 --> 47:39.570]  battle fungus gnats in a 24 light flowering room. All right. We are 47 minutes in. I'm
[47:39.570 --> 47:42.410]  not sure if we should try to keep going or if we should save this next part for another
[47:42.410 --> 47:46.650]  episode because we're, uh, we kind of got them on the edge of their seats right now.
[47:46.650 --> 47:52.690]  Yeah. We'll talk about, we'll talk about this one spot right here. And then, uh, so we're
[47:52.690 --> 47:56.850]  gonna talk a little bit about room size in relation to how many and what type of lights
[47:56.850 --> 48:02.810]  to use. We got about 10 minutes to do this. So a small closet set up. Uh, I would use
[48:02.810 --> 48:08.890]  some small T5 lights, little fluorescent lights. I personally don't like the coiled
[48:08.890 --> 48:13.730]  CFLs. I don't feel like they put out enough light. They work great as supplements. If
[48:13.730 --> 48:16.570]  it's all you got, that's going to, if it's all you've got and all you can power, it's
[48:16.570 --> 48:20.090]  going to work. But for the amount of heat that they put off, I don't think they put
[48:20.090 --> 48:26.210]  off enough light. I agree. Totally. Awesome. Uh, for a closet, I would almost recommend
[48:26.210 --> 48:31.310]  it's a T5 light. I think there are eight bulbs and I think it's 24 by 24 is the dimensions
[48:31.310 --> 48:37.070]  of it. Uh, and I think it's actually made by Hydro Farm. If you've got a small closet,
[48:37.070 --> 48:40.830]  that is the perfect light. In my opinion. Uh, if you can't run a lot of electricity,
[48:40.830 --> 48:44.830]  you can put that in a small fan and leave the closet cracked a little bit. You've got
[48:44.830 --> 48:48.430]  a grow room, dude. As long as you're getting that stale air out of there and not letting
[48:48.430 --> 48:53.590]  it get too hot, keep the, those T5 lights right above your plants. And then every night
[48:53.590 --> 48:57.150]  you got to close that closet door at the same time and turn off your light to start your
[48:57.150 --> 49:01.070]  flower cycle. And you got to be on the money eight o'clock, eight o'clock every day and
[49:01.070 --> 49:05.390]  night. But so in a small closet, I think that little T5 light I'm talking about is perfect
[49:05.390 --> 49:12.150]  or maybe a small HID, a high intensity discharge light. Uh, maybe like a one 50 in a closet.
[49:12.150 --> 49:16.470]  I really like a 250 watt high pressure sodium light. I really find those to be efficient.
[49:16.470 --> 49:20.270]  Those are cool lights. It's a great size light. Doesn't take a lot of wattage, but it does
[49:20.270 --> 49:26.510]  make a little bit of heat. Uh, even, um, you know, if your closet's a little bigger, 400s
[49:26.510 --> 49:29.950]  are great. That's great. That's exactly what I wrote down. I was going to say a 400 is
[49:29.950 --> 49:32.950]  kind of the biggest you really want to go in a closet unless you got like one of those
[49:32.950 --> 49:38.830]  fancy like Bel Air walk-in closets. Uh, but everyone's got a small closet they can dedicate
[49:38.830 --> 49:42.690]  to a grow space. So if you're just trying to supply herb for you and your girlfriend
[49:42.690 --> 49:46.390]  or something, or your patient, just you, the closet is fine. Especially with the little
[49:46.390 --> 49:50.910]  T5 light. I think you could pull some, some stuff out of a T5. Is that where your first
[49:50.910 --> 49:56.550]  grow was it in a closet? Uh, technically yes, it was in a closet, but inside of that
[49:56.550 --> 50:00.710]  closet I put a grow hut in there. It was kind of a large closet. It was more of a, uh, it
[50:00.710 --> 50:05.470]  was a closet that was actually attached to the hot water heater area. So the closet had
[50:05.470 --> 50:11.230]  another door in it and I actually took the ducting from my hot water heater and my heater
[50:11.230 --> 50:17.670]  and use some of the CO2, uh, to my grow room. Yeah. That can be a little dangerous. Yes.
[50:17.670 --> 50:22.270]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't don't do that if you don't know what you're doing. Nice.
[50:22.270 --> 50:26.270]  Uh, so yeah, perfect little closet. Uh, it's a great way to grow. You can grow a little
[50:26.270 --> 50:31.910]  short plants in there. You can supply yourself. Oh yeah. A small corner of a room works. If
[50:31.910 --> 50:37.350]  you need to like tarp off a room or like if you have a small room that you can just take
[50:37.350 --> 50:41.230]  the corner, you can put a grow hut in the corner. Grow huts are awesome. I said, I'm
[50:41.230 --> 50:44.550]  going to do a whole talk about those. That will be another episode guys. We're at 50
[50:44.550 --> 50:48.790]  minutes now. I've noticed you guys don't listen past 45 a lot of the, the listeners
[50:48.790 --> 50:54.390]  click out at 45 minutes. You're droning off. I mean you're not droning on this. What I
[50:54.390 --> 50:59.910]  meant, it didn't mean I meant after, after a while we, if we listen to the show, I can
[50:59.910 --> 51:04.150]  tell we run out of energy about an hour. It's like, Oh my throat's done. All the listeners
[51:04.150 --> 51:10.950]  are getting drowsy. Yes. Okay. Well yeah. And I don't blame you guys. Uh, so you got
[51:10.950 --> 51:15.470]  that small corner, small space. You can put a T five all the way up to like a 600 watt
[51:15.470 --> 51:21.390]  light and like a six by six space if you can vent it. Uh, we'll talk in the next episode.
[51:21.390 --> 51:25.270]  Jesse is actually like a carpenter craftsman house builder, manly man. So he's going to
[51:25.270 --> 51:28.910]  talk about framing up a space and stuff. Uh, in the next episode we're going to try to
[51:28.910 --> 51:33.990]  get this part done quickly here. Grow huts. I will talk a lot about them. Uh, you can
[51:33.990 --> 51:38.510]  put a grow hut in the corner of any room. You can put multiple grow huts in a basement.
[51:39.150 --> 51:43.210]  You can put one grow hut in every room. If you've got limited power, find out where each
[51:43.210 --> 51:47.790]  room is on each breaker and put one grow hut on each breaker. You can grow plenty of cannabis
[51:47.790 --> 51:52.490]  in one house or one location. Sounds like my kind of place. I think I've been to houses
[51:52.490 --> 51:56.930]  like this. Uh, then of course there's the whole dedicated bedroom. If you've got a nice
[51:56.930 --> 52:02.330]  bedroom that nobody needs, if you're a single guy and your roommate sucks, kick him out,
[52:02.330 --> 52:06.750]  build a grow room. He won't eat your food. He won't bring over ugly chicks. You got to
[52:06.750 --> 52:10.410]  grow room in there now. It's going to produce dank cannabis and it will pay for itself.
[52:10.410 --> 52:14.890]  Uh, something I should write down to talk about is the cost of running the grow room
[52:14.890 --> 52:18.550]  because that's just on my mind. Huh? I had more paper here and I don't know where the
[52:18.550 --> 52:24.150]  note I wrote earlier went, but we'll write that right here. It's expensive. Uh, big grow
[52:24.150 --> 52:30.430]  rooms, big facilities and stuff like that. Astronomical electricity bills. But imagine
[52:30.430 --> 52:34.110]  if, uh, if imagine if you and I were roommates and you kicked me out and built a grow room
[52:34.110 --> 52:38.150]  in my space, it would definitely pay for itself in the long run and it wouldn't eat
[52:38.150 --> 52:44.910]  your freaking Ben and Jerry's. It would get you high as crap in the end. So a whole room,
[52:44.910 --> 52:49.130]  you can put multiple, depending on the size of your room, if you've got, so I say like
[52:49.130 --> 52:53.470]  every six by six, four by four, four by four to six by six space, you should put about
[52:53.470 --> 52:57.550]  a thousand watt light if you can vent it. Uh, if you've got a room that's like 10 by
[52:57.550 --> 53:01.750]  10, I think you should put 4,000 while lights in there. Uh, if you're getting bigger and
[53:01.750 --> 53:07.310]  bigger, I, it kind of depends on your wattage and stuff, but about every five by five square
[53:07.310 --> 53:12.830]  should be a thousand watt light. If you can vent that, I try to leave. People hate walkways.
[53:12.830 --> 53:16.750]  A lot of growers say that walkways are expensive and a waste of space. I like giving myself
[53:16.750 --> 53:21.790]  a walkway so I can get to every single plant and I think the plants like the space to breathe.
[53:21.790 --> 53:25.590]  Uh, you don't like being crowded in on the bus with everybody touching you. Your plants
[53:25.590 --> 53:28.750]  don't like that shit either. Give them some room to breathe and keeping the leaves off
[53:28.750 --> 53:34.230]  of each other will prevent powdery mildew and places for bugs to jump around. So if
[53:34.230 --> 53:40.430]  you've got a whole room, put up 1000 watt light every five by five space up to the limit
[53:40.430 --> 53:45.790]  that your electricity will allow and that you can cool. Um, here's a random recommendation.
[53:45.790 --> 53:51.390]  I think it's about 3000 BTU use of cooling for every single thousand watt light is what
[53:51.390 --> 53:56.630]  I think you want. 2,500 to 3000. Okay. So keep that in mind when you're, and you have
[53:56.630 --> 54:04.110]  to power that air conditioner also. So in your big room here, if you've got, uh, and
[54:04.110 --> 54:07.430]  you're 30 and you're two 30 amp breakers, you're going to be able to run one, maybe
[54:07.430 --> 54:13.030]  two lights and an air conditioner. Um, that's going to be about it on a 30 amp breaker.
[54:13.030 --> 54:16.830]  So you're going to need an, uh, an electrician to come wire up your big room. Yeah. You're
[54:16.830 --> 54:20.070]  not going to be able to get the air conditioner on that. Most likely. Uh, if you've got a
[54:20.070 --> 54:25.150]  big garage or a basement, you need to have the electrician come and wire you up with
[54:25.150 --> 54:30.990]  a 240 in the whole basement. And then you need to have a mini split put in the basement
[54:30.990 --> 54:35.110]  and hang like 24 lights down there in your basement. And you gotta have an HVAC guy come
[54:35.110 --> 54:40.670]  set that up. Yeah. And yeah, they're fun. Yeah. That mini split is going to be fun to
[54:40.670 --> 54:44.450]  put in, but man, you can keep it so cool once you get it there. And then the next step up
[54:44.450 --> 54:48.630]  from there, uh, after you have your basement or your big garage with multiple thousands,
[54:48.630 --> 54:53.310]  uh, anything more than nine lights, I think becomes like kind of extensive for a home
[54:53.310 --> 54:57.630]  grow. Like, yeah, if you got like 10 lights in a house, you're kind of pushing it. But
[54:57.630 --> 55:01.430]  then you move on to like the commercial scale warehouses where you've got multiple rooms
[55:01.430 --> 55:05.870]  with multiple thousand watt lights or one giant room with a hundred lights in it. I
[55:05.870 --> 55:09.870]  kind of prefer more separated rooms. Uh, I like to breed and if something goes wrong
[55:09.870 --> 55:14.510]  in one room, you don't have it everywhere. Yeah. It's a little more containable. So my
[55:14.510 --> 55:19.550]  main point is plan the room before you start building. Uh, think about how many lights
[55:19.550 --> 55:23.070]  you want to run. Think about how much cannabis you want to produce. Uh, think about your
[55:23.070 --> 55:27.150]  electrical limitations. Think about your budget. It's going to cost you, we said about a hundred
[55:27.150 --> 55:32.190]  bucks a month to run a light and its accessories. So keep that in mind until harvest. You're
[55:32.190 --> 55:35.910]  not going to have, uh, you're going to have to figure out how to pay for that. Once harvest
[55:35.910 --> 55:39.830]  comes, then you obviously have a way to pay for that. Uh, we're going to be at an hour
[55:39.830 --> 55:43.510]  real quick here, guys. This is a good way to make this a two part episode. The part
[55:43.510 --> 55:47.870]  we're going to come up with next is actually the basic steps to building the room and some
[55:47.870 --> 55:51.950]  guidance on building a room and things to look for. Uh, I'm going to cut this episode
[55:51.950 --> 55:56.630]  off right here and we'll make that part two. Uh, dude, thanks for coming to do it. Another
[55:56.630 --> 56:01.230]  great episode. We just crushed this one. I feel like, yeah, um, we kind of droned on
