[00:00.000 --> 00:02.520]  All right, here we go.
[00:02.520 --> 00:03.840]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:03.840 --> 00:08.560]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 602 of the Grow From Your
[00:08.560 --> 00:09.560]  Heart podcast.
[00:09.560 --> 00:14.620]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about making your own silver thiosulfate spray to reverse
[00:14.620 --> 00:16.860]  your plants to make feminized seeds.
[00:16.860 --> 00:19.860]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the folks who support the
[00:19.860 --> 00:21.620]  show on Patreon.
[00:21.620 --> 00:23.840]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.840 --> 00:26.200]  Thank you, shout out to our new friend, Colin Hughes.
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.480]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Robert S. I want to send a big thank you shout out
[00:29.480 --> 00:30.980]  to Freedom Farms.
[00:30.980 --> 00:32.760]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to O.N.G.
[00:32.760 --> 00:33.760]  Crossman.
[00:33.760 --> 00:36.280]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to our buddy Redbeard.
[00:36.280 --> 00:38.760]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Lernon and Bernon.
[00:38.760 --> 00:42.560]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to our new friend DZ from Detroit.
[00:42.560 --> 00:45.020]  Let's send a big fist bump and a Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:45.020 --> 00:47.380]  Thank you, shout out to our friend Guy-Uti Grows.
[00:47.380 --> 00:49.680]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Tartan Mike.
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.640]  I want to send a special thank you to Pac Northwest Dan.
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.720]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.240]  Thank you, shout out to Tree Star Meadow.
[01:00.240 --> 01:03.900]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:03.900 --> 01:07.180]  If you are not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all
[01:07.180 --> 01:13.100]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:13.100 --> 01:16.540]  All of the information you need to support the show is right there on the screen.
[01:16.540 --> 01:20.460]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:20.460 --> 01:22.480]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.620]  Maybe you're driving, maybe you're working, maybe you got your hands full.
[01:25.620 --> 01:26.620]  Be safe.
[01:26.620 --> 01:28.120]  You can use that link when it is time.
[01:28.120 --> 01:32.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, without a whole bunch of chatter, I do want to apologize
[01:32.600 --> 01:34.720]  for the Monday episode being late.
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.400]  I have not missed a Monday in I think five or six, maybe seven years worth of podcasting.
[01:39.400 --> 01:41.280]  I've never missed a Monday.
[01:41.280 --> 01:43.000]  This Monday, the show was delayed.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.120]  It wasn't, I came out on Monday still, but it was barely Monday in the mountain time
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.120]  zone when it came out.
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.800]  There was a technical difficulty with my website where the podcast is posted.
[01:52.800 --> 01:55.640]  I had to contact a couple of people to try to help me.
[01:55.660 --> 01:57.740]  I was left with a couple of baffled faces.
[01:57.740 --> 02:02.500]  Eventually, I contacted the web hosting service and they were able to get me fixed up.
[02:02.500 --> 02:06.420]  It took a couple of hours on the phone, some head scratching, some clicking, some punching
[02:06.420 --> 02:07.420]  away.
[02:07.420 --> 02:08.420]  We got it solved.
[02:08.420 --> 02:11.700]  So big shout out to everybody who let me know that the podcast was late.
[02:11.700 --> 02:13.900]  Big shout out to everybody who was concerned.
[02:13.900 --> 02:15.500]  People that reminded me, hey bro, it's Monday.
[02:15.500 --> 02:17.220]  There's no podcast on iTunes.
[02:17.220 --> 02:18.940]  I know I was scrambling.
[02:18.940 --> 02:21.220]  Big shout out to the web hosting company.
[02:21.220 --> 02:22.220]  I was going to say their name.
[02:22.220 --> 02:25.460]  I don't want to say their name because I don't want you to know where the podcast is hosted.
[02:26.280 --> 02:28.040]  It's just safer that way for everybody.
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.680]  But big shout out to the web hosting company that was able to get my website back up, get
[02:32.680 --> 02:35.240]  the service going for everybody.
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.000]  And big shout out to everybody who wanted to remind me that the show was late.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.480]  That is my point here.
[02:39.480 --> 02:40.800]  It was up on YouTube on time.
[02:40.800 --> 02:42.840]  So technically we were not late at all.
[02:42.840 --> 02:46.040]  I did have something to show that I really did do a podcast.
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.040]  It was there.
[02:47.040 --> 02:49.600]  We did a premiere on Monday on YouTube.
[02:49.600 --> 02:50.600]  I hope you joined us.
[02:50.600 --> 02:54.600]  And if you didn't join us for the next premiere, every time I do an episode, I do the premiere.
[02:54.740 --> 02:57.380]  That is Monday night at midnight or Thursday night at midnight.
[02:57.380 --> 03:01.540]  It's actually Sunday night rolling into Monday or Wednesday night rolling into Thursday.
[03:01.540 --> 03:05.540]  That's when I premiere the episodes is at 12 o'clock midnight mountain time.
[03:05.540 --> 03:07.860]  I don't know your time zone, but join me in the mountain time.
[03:07.860 --> 03:08.860]  I know.
[03:08.860 --> 03:09.860]  Why do I do it late at night?
[03:09.860 --> 03:12.820]  Because that way the podcast is there for everybody in the morning and I can still stay
[03:12.820 --> 03:15.020]  up late that night and hang out in the premiere.
[03:15.020 --> 03:17.740]  I think 12 o'clock works beautifully.
[03:17.740 --> 03:18.940]  I am fucking rambling.
[03:18.940 --> 03:22.260]  We're going to get out of these rambles and we're going to work ourselves into some emails.
[03:22.260 --> 03:27.720]  I've got one quick Patreon message before we talk about making our own silver thiosulfate
[03:27.720 --> 03:29.000]  solution.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.680]  This message comes from Patreon.
[03:30.680 --> 03:32.520]  It comes from our good friend, Girls Grow Too.
[03:32.520 --> 03:33.760]  Shout out to Girls Grow Too.
[03:33.760 --> 03:36.840]  Hope everything is doing marvelously in your garden.
[03:36.840 --> 03:38.920]  I'm going to catch my breath and read this message.
[03:38.920 --> 03:42.980]  It says, you mentioned you taste in colors.
[03:42.980 --> 03:45.360]  You may have what is called synesthesia.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  It's a real thing.
[03:46.360 --> 03:50.120]  And when you mentioned it, I wanted to tell you the show keeps getting better.
[03:50.140 --> 03:52.140]  Thanks for all of the continued work you do.
[03:52.140 --> 03:55.000]  Cheers to 2021.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.460]  So in a previous episode, I mentioned that I think I smell in colors and I've been told
[04:00.460 --> 04:01.700]  that that's an official thing.
[04:01.700 --> 04:04.980]  It looks like I've been diagnosed with synesthesia.
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.180]  I'm not crazy.
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.460]  My mother had me tested.
[04:08.460 --> 04:12.980]  Big thank you for the great update of the diagnosis, I guess we can say.
[04:12.980 --> 04:14.520]  I'm going to read more about that.
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.820]  And now I don't feel like I am as crazy.
[04:16.820 --> 04:18.060]  Trust me, I still feel crazy.
[04:18.060 --> 04:19.340]  But that's one more thing.
[04:19.360 --> 04:20.360]  You don't have to worry about.
[04:20.360 --> 04:22.720]  All right, let's get to the point of this podcast.
[04:22.720 --> 04:24.280]  This is going to be a short episode.
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.840]  But I promise you this is going to be a very valuable episode for a lot of people.
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.800]  So with no further ado, let's get into this great question that came from our friend Joe.
[04:33.800 --> 04:36.120]  And it goes a lot like this.
[04:36.120 --> 04:37.320]  It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.000]  I saw you on the Dude Grows show before and I had to check out your podcast.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.400]  Big shout out to all of my friends in the DGC.
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.800]  Shout out to the Dude Grows crew.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.400]  Big shout out to Scotty Real.
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.400]  Shout out to the dude.
[04:48.460 --> 04:52.540]  Shout out to Guru and big shout out to everybody behind the scenes that makes that show happen.
[04:52.540 --> 04:56.620]  I understand there are a lot of people that make that show the wonderful production it
[04:56.620 --> 04:57.620]  is.
[04:57.620 --> 05:00.260]  Big shout out to each and every one of the people behind the scenes as well.
[05:00.260 --> 05:02.440]  They get overlooked quite a bit.
[05:02.440 --> 05:04.180]  Big shout out to the DGC gang.
[05:04.180 --> 05:06.780]  I'm glad you found me through the Dude Grows crew.
[05:06.780 --> 05:08.500]  It's I had to check out your podcast.
[05:08.500 --> 05:12.860]  Thank you for all of the knowledge and for keeping it simple for us stoners.
[05:12.860 --> 05:16.180]  I like to explain things in a way that everybody can understand.
[05:16.180 --> 05:18.220]  Some people learn from this angle.
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.240]  Some learn from this angle.
[05:19.240 --> 05:22.040]  I make sure to deliver my teachings from a lot of angles.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.520]  I did not like school.
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.480]  I love learning but I didn't enjoy school.
[05:26.480 --> 05:30.800]  That may sound redundant but I'm not good at sitting in a classroom looking at a chalkboard
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.240]  or now it's a dry erase board I guess and listening to some boring ass person drone
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.480]  on for eight hours a day.
[05:36.480 --> 05:37.720]  That was not for me.
[05:37.720 --> 05:42.000]  I understand that learning can be totally boring for some people and I try to keep it
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  entertaining.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  I try to keep it fun.
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.640]  Try to tell a couple of jokes in there.
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.460]  So I'm glad you find it that I'm keeping it simple for the stoners.
[05:49.460 --> 05:51.060]  I try to keep everybody involved.
[05:51.060 --> 05:54.260]  If you're a new grower, if you're an advanced grower, if you're a pro grower, that's always
[05:54.260 --> 05:55.260]  been my slogan.
[05:55.260 --> 05:57.220]  I try to have something for you.
[05:57.220 --> 06:00.540]  It says I have a question about silver thiosulfate.
[06:00.540 --> 06:05.540]  If you recommend a certain brand also when to spray and how often to spray and how you
[06:05.540 --> 06:06.540]  dilute your spray.
[06:06.540 --> 06:10.260]  I know you said different strains will require different solutions and intervals.
[06:10.260 --> 06:13.900]  I just want a good starting point or a reference to go off of.
[06:13.900 --> 06:14.900]  Thanks again.
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.520]  And of course this comes from our buddy Joe.
[06:17.520 --> 06:18.960]  Joe thank you for the great question.
[06:18.960 --> 06:20.960]  There is a lot to talk about here.
[06:20.960 --> 06:28.200]  What Joe is asking about is a silver thiosulfate solution which would be used to reverse a
[06:28.200 --> 06:29.200]  plant.
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.040]  That reversed plant would then create pollen and that pollen would then create feminized
[06:33.040 --> 06:34.040]  seeds.
[06:34.040 --> 06:37.040]  I have talked in great detail about feminized seeds on other episodes.
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.040]  I'll include a link to the other feminized seed episode in the show notes.
[06:41.180 --> 06:45.380]  Basically what we are going to do is take a female plant and we are going to treat it
[06:45.380 --> 06:46.900]  with this solution.
[06:46.900 --> 06:51.500]  That will cause this plant to create pollen sacks which only contain female chromosomes
[06:51.500 --> 06:53.140]  because it's a true female plant.
[06:53.140 --> 06:54.460]  We have tested that solid.
[06:54.460 --> 06:55.720]  It's a female.
[06:55.720 --> 06:58.220]  It will make pollen with female chromosomes.
[06:58.220 --> 07:00.740]  We put that on another female plant.
[07:00.740 --> 07:03.860]  The seeds that come from there are all females.
[07:03.860 --> 07:08.480]  The way that we do that is with a silver thiosulfate solution.
[07:08.860 --> 07:12.100]  Our friend Joe asked what brand do I use?
[07:12.100 --> 07:16.100]  There are a lot of reversal products out there on the market.
[07:16.100 --> 07:20.220]  There are a lot of companies making pre-mixed silver thiosulfate solutions.
[07:20.220 --> 07:21.220]  There are a lot of options.
[07:21.220 --> 07:22.580]  I make my own.
[07:22.580 --> 07:23.580]  I buy silver nitrate.
[07:23.580 --> 07:24.580]  What do I buy?
[07:24.580 --> 07:26.340]  I wrote it down because I want to make sure I get it right.
[07:26.340 --> 07:30.900]  I bought silver nitrate and I buy sodium thiosulfate in separate containers.
[07:30.900 --> 07:37.880]  They are dry powdered forms and I make my own silver thiosulfate solution.
[07:37.880 --> 07:42.340]  This will work on 90% of the plants you are trying to reverse.
[07:42.340 --> 07:46.640]  Most of the products on the market are overpriced and unnecessary when you can make your own
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.680]  silver thiosulfate for about $13 for probably 100 gallons.
[07:51.680 --> 07:53.100]  You don't need to make that much at a time.
[07:53.100 --> 07:55.540]  You only need about half a gallon at a time.
[07:55.540 --> 07:58.280]  It's probably the most I've ever needed.
[07:58.280 --> 08:01.340]  You don't need to make a lot at a time and you don't need a lot of product to make it.
[08:01.340 --> 08:02.740]  You don't need a lot of money.
[08:02.740 --> 08:06.500]  If you do have plants that are a little bit stubborn, there is one product out there that
[08:06.500 --> 08:08.360]  I'm not going to say is overpriced.
[08:08.360 --> 08:13.200]  If you've got some stubborn plants that won't reverse, that one reversal spray may be worth
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.200]  the money.
[08:14.200 --> 08:17.480]  But otherwise, I would say make your own silver thiosulfate.
[08:17.480 --> 08:19.480]  I'm going to teach you guys how to be self-sufficient.
[08:19.480 --> 08:21.680]  I want you self-sufficient and always.
[08:21.680 --> 08:23.640]  So you're going to get some gold from me today.
[08:23.640 --> 08:27.360]  Today we're going to talk about making our own silver thiosulfate solution.
[08:27.360 --> 08:30.040]  I'm going to clear my throat really quickly and then we will move forward.
[08:30.040 --> 08:32.160]  All right, excuse me.
[08:32.160 --> 08:34.920]  I felt it was better to get that out of the way instead of just keep doing it.
[08:34.920 --> 08:36.080]  All right, here we go.
[08:36.660 --> 08:40.100]  So we're going to make our own silver thiosulfate solution to reverse our plants.
[08:40.100 --> 08:42.660]  The first thing we need is distilled water.
[08:42.660 --> 08:44.980]  I highly recommend distilled water.
[08:44.980 --> 08:46.180]  Distilled water is easy to get.
[08:46.180 --> 08:47.340]  It's very affordable.
[08:47.340 --> 08:49.460]  It's probably two bucks for a gallon.
[08:49.460 --> 08:52.540]  You can probably get it at the gas station or the grocery store right down the street
[08:52.540 --> 08:53.580]  from wherever you are.
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.860]  So we start off with distilled water.
[08:55.860 --> 08:59.060]  Then like I said before, we need silver nitrate.
[08:59.060 --> 09:01.620]  We also need sodium thiosulfate.
[09:01.620 --> 09:04.860]  These products are both readily available on the internet.
[09:04.880 --> 09:08.160]  A very short Google search will find these products for you.
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.120]  Don't spend too much.
[09:09.120 --> 09:11.040]  They are very affordable products.
[09:11.040 --> 09:14.520]  The most expensive part will probably be shipping.
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.560]  They're going to ask you all kinds of questions.
[09:16.560 --> 09:18.200]  Some of the websites ask more questions.
[09:18.200 --> 09:20.680]  Some websites don't ask any questions.
[09:20.680 --> 09:23.520]  These products could be used for photography.
[09:23.520 --> 09:26.160]  There is a wide range of uses for these products.
[09:26.160 --> 09:28.440]  If they ask a lot of questions, maybe don't use that website.
[09:28.440 --> 09:31.120]  Find the website that doesn't ask you what you're using it for.
[09:31.120 --> 09:33.240]  Find a website that I don't know where you are.
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.720]  Find a website in your country.
[09:34.780 --> 09:36.660]  So you don't have to ship these products over the border
[09:36.660 --> 09:39.100]  so that you get them more quickly.
[09:39.100 --> 09:40.020]  Something I'm going to jump in.
[09:40.020 --> 09:42.860]  This is not in my notes, but I feel like I do need to say this
[09:42.860 --> 09:46.480]  anytime I talk about mixing or touching dangerous products.
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.100]  Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment.
[09:50.100 --> 09:53.140]  Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment.
[09:53.140 --> 09:54.380]  These products are caustic.
[09:54.380 --> 09:56.140]  You don't want to breathe in silver nitrate
[09:56.140 --> 09:57.740]  or sodium thiosulfate.
[09:57.740 --> 09:59.420]  It's very fine particles.
[09:59.420 --> 10:01.720]  If you're new at this, please protect yourself.
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.940]  If you're experienced at this, please protect yourself.
[10:03.960 --> 10:06.720]  Wear a respirator, maybe even some goggles.
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.960]  Wear some gloves.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.080]  Please protect yourself.
[10:09.080 --> 10:10.680]  I know you're going to say that's extreme,
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.520]  but I'm teaching you how to do something.
[10:12.520 --> 10:14.360]  I need to teach you how to protect yourself.
[10:14.360 --> 10:17.520]  Please protect yourself when making these products.
[10:17.520 --> 10:18.900]  So you're going to get distilled water.
[10:18.900 --> 10:20.640]  You will need silver nitrate.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.120]  You will need sodium thiosulfate.
[10:23.120 --> 10:24.620]  You'll need a couple of containers.
[10:24.620 --> 10:27.840]  I prefer glass containers, glass vessels.
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.240]  We're going to put 500 milliliters in one container of water,
[10:32.260 --> 10:34.060]  of distilled water in one container,
[10:34.060 --> 10:37.520]  and 500 milliliters of distilled water in another container.
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.300]  Then we're going to pour those two containers of water
[10:40.300 --> 10:42.240]  into one vessel of water.
[10:42.240 --> 10:45.420]  So we need two containers that will hold 500 milliliters each
[10:45.420 --> 10:47.520]  and we need another vessel which will hold
[10:47.520 --> 10:49.420]  at least one liter of water.
[10:49.420 --> 10:51.600]  A thousand milliliters is going to go
[10:51.600 --> 10:53.140]  into this next container.
[10:53.140 --> 10:56.060]  So the way that we do it, the way that I do it,
[10:56.060 --> 10:59.780]  is I will take one half of a gram of silver nitrate.
[10:59.780 --> 11:00.700]  I'll repeat that.
[11:00.700 --> 11:04.640]  One half a gram, 0.5 of a gram of silver nitrate.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.680]  And I will drop that into 500 milliliters of distilled water
[11:08.680 --> 11:10.880]  and stir it until it is completely dissolved.
[11:10.880 --> 11:12.440]  It shouldn't take too long.
[11:12.440 --> 11:16.360]  Then I will take a separate jar or container
[11:16.360 --> 11:17.560]  of distilled water.
[11:17.560 --> 11:20.200]  This is jar number two or jar B.
[11:20.200 --> 11:22.840]  500 milliliters of distilled water.
[11:22.840 --> 11:26.280]  To that jar I will add two and a half grams
[11:26.280 --> 11:28.880]  of sodium thiosulfate powder.
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.160]  2.5 grams of sodium thiosulfate
[11:32.160 --> 11:35.580]  to the 500 milliliters of distilled water.
[11:35.580 --> 11:37.380]  Now I've got my jar A and my jar B.
[11:37.380 --> 11:40.600]  I've got my silver nitrate, my sodium thiosulfate jars
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.640]  that are separate.
[11:41.640 --> 11:43.000]  We've stirred them both up.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.020]  I use a butter knife to stir them, honestly,
[11:45.020 --> 11:46.780]  because it's metal, nothing's gonna stick to it.
[11:46.780 --> 11:47.980]  It's non-porous.
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.560]  I use the butter knife.
[11:49.560 --> 11:50.820]  I pull it out, I clean it,
[11:50.820 --> 11:53.100]  stir the other one with the butter knife.
[11:53.100 --> 11:55.460]  That's what I use, honestly.
[11:55.460 --> 11:57.540]  Then, like I mentioned a moment ago,
[11:57.540 --> 11:59.160]  we will take those two bottles,
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.680]  those two jars of solution,
[12:00.680 --> 12:02.400]  and pour them into the one container.
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.080]  In most cases you would mix one into the other.
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.640]  I honestly, since my containers are full at this time,
[12:07.640 --> 12:08.980]  I've got a bigger vessel here.
[12:08.980 --> 12:11.400]  I pour them both into there kinda at the same time
[12:11.400 --> 12:12.800]  and stir them with the butter knife
[12:12.800 --> 12:14.200]  after they're poured into there.
[12:14.200 --> 12:17.760]  Now you have got a silver thiosulfate solution
[12:17.760 --> 12:20.240]  that is a 100% ratio.
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.080]  Do not spray that 100% concentrate onto the plants.
[12:24.080 --> 12:26.360]  We need to dilute that solution.
[12:26.380 --> 12:28.180]  Let's jump into that part now.
[12:28.180 --> 12:32.620]  We've got our one, a liter of silver thiosulfate solution
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.180]  in our large vessel.
[12:34.180 --> 12:35.660]  This is when I get a spray bottle,
[12:35.660 --> 12:36.820]  just a basic spray bottle.
[12:36.820 --> 12:37.820]  I get them from Uline.
[12:37.820 --> 12:39.660]  You can get them from the dollar store.
[12:39.660 --> 12:40.820]  What's that other place?
[12:40.820 --> 12:42.460]  Harbor Freight's got them all the time.
[12:42.460 --> 12:43.740]  Just a basic spray bottle.
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.700]  You'd put a window cleaner in it and spray the window,
[12:45.700 --> 12:48.100]  psst, psst, psst, and spray the window and wipe it down.
[12:48.100 --> 12:50.620]  That's the exact type of spray bottle I'm talking about.
[12:50.620 --> 12:52.780]  Maybe something, depending on how many plants
[12:52.780 --> 12:54.820]  you're spraying, you may want something bigger.
[12:54.840 --> 12:57.560]  The small squirt pump spray bottle works just fine
[12:57.560 --> 12:58.860]  for what I'm doing.
[12:58.860 --> 13:02.480]  So then I will take, this is where it comes in
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.680]  to adjusting for the plant.
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.800]  I will start with a one to nine dilution.
[13:08.800 --> 13:11.840]  I will use one part silver thiosulfate
[13:11.840 --> 13:13.800]  and nine parts distilled water.
[13:13.800 --> 13:16.000]  So I'm diluting it one to nine.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.840]  One part of the silver thiosulfate solution,
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.720]  nine parts distilled water.
[13:20.720 --> 13:23.560]  So if my spray bottle will hold a thousand milliliters,
[13:23.560 --> 13:27.400]  I put 100 milliliters of silver thiosulfate solution
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.300]  in there, then I top it off with 900 milliliters
[13:30.300 --> 13:32.540]  of clean water, the distilled water,
[13:32.540 --> 13:34.220]  then I shake the shit out of it to make sure
[13:34.220 --> 13:35.860]  I've got a nice mix in there.
[13:35.860 --> 13:38.580]  And I've got a thousand milliliters in a spray bottle.
[13:38.580 --> 13:40.880]  This is when we start treating the plants.
[13:40.880 --> 13:43.720]  See how easy it was to make the silver thiosulfate solution?
[13:43.720 --> 13:46.300]  That's why I don't want you guys paying so much money
[13:46.300 --> 13:47.140]  for these products.
[13:47.140 --> 13:49.320]  You get 500 milliliters of something
[13:49.320 --> 13:50.820]  and you gotta spray it way often.
[13:50.820 --> 13:52.020]  You don't have enough of the solution.
[13:52.020 --> 13:54.320]  It's not gonna work and it was way overpriced.
[13:54.320 --> 13:55.520]  Don't buy into those products.
[13:55.520 --> 13:57.920]  Like I said, there's one product that is worth it
[13:57.920 --> 13:59.800]  if you're having a hard time reversing plants,
[13:59.800 --> 14:02.240]  but otherwise don't spend that expensive money
[14:02.240 --> 14:05.000]  because most of the time silver thiosulfate will do it
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.120]  and it's very affordable.
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.160]  You'll be amazed at how affordable this project will be.
[14:09.160 --> 14:11.920]  It's like 13 bucks and you can make gallons and gallons
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.740]  of this stuff.
[14:12.740 --> 14:15.160]  So we've used a half a gram of silver nitrate,
[14:15.160 --> 14:17.480]  two and a half grams of sodium thiosulfate.
[14:17.480 --> 14:18.800]  That's in our liter of water.
[14:18.800 --> 14:20.320]  It's all mixed up together.
[14:20.340 --> 14:24.020]  We've diluted that into our spray bottle.
[14:24.020 --> 14:26.180]  We've got 100 milliliters of STS,
[14:26.180 --> 14:30.940]  900 milliliters of the distilled water in a spray bottle.
[14:30.940 --> 14:33.620]  Now it is time to start spraying the plant.
[14:33.620 --> 14:34.820]  Let me jump back into the message
[14:34.820 --> 14:36.980]  and make sure I'm getting all of the things you asked for.
[14:36.980 --> 14:38.020]  Certain brand.
[14:38.020 --> 14:40.420]  Okay, when to spray is the next part of the question here.
[14:40.420 --> 14:45.300]  When to spray is a very important part of this equation.
[14:45.300 --> 14:50.300]  I spray about a week before I put the plant into flower.
[14:50.620 --> 14:53.060]  So if I'm gonna put the plant into flower on the 7th,
[14:53.060 --> 14:55.220]  I will spray it on the 1st.
[14:55.220 --> 14:57.060]  Today I'm recording on a Wednesday.
[14:57.060 --> 14:59.340]  If I wanted to flip my plants on Wednesday,
[14:59.340 --> 15:01.540]  I would spray them on Wednesday.
[15:01.540 --> 15:03.580]  So pull that plant that you plan on flipping
[15:03.580 --> 15:04.900]  out of the room.
[15:04.900 --> 15:07.300]  Don't do it in the room with the rest of the plants.
[15:07.300 --> 15:08.900]  Don't think you can control the spray.
[15:08.900 --> 15:09.820]  Don't be a dumb ass.
[15:09.820 --> 15:11.100]  Don't be a smart ass.
[15:11.100 --> 15:12.880]  Take the plant out of the room.
[15:12.880 --> 15:15.700]  Spray it with the silver thiosulfate solution.
[15:15.700 --> 15:16.980]  Spray it to runoff.
[15:16.980 --> 15:19.660]  I like to spray it till it's really running off.
[15:19.660 --> 15:22.800]  Also, don't just spray the leaves with the solution.
[15:22.800 --> 15:23.760]  Spray the stems.
[15:23.760 --> 15:24.640]  Spray the stalks.
[15:24.640 --> 15:27.400]  Get the entire plant with the silver thiosulfate.
[15:27.400 --> 15:29.820]  We wanna get as much of the silver into the plant.
[15:29.820 --> 15:32.400]  The sodium thiosulfate is a carrier agent.
[15:32.400 --> 15:34.480]  The silver actually gets into the plant
[15:34.480 --> 15:36.700]  and causes the reaction which I spoke about
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.000]  in the Feminize Seed episode.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.200]  Not gonna go too far into that right now.
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.560]  So pull that plant out.
[15:41.560 --> 15:42.400]  Spray it.
[15:42.400 --> 15:44.000]  When it is completely dry,
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.840]  you can put it back in the grow room.
[15:45.840 --> 15:46.880]  Then you wait a week.
[15:46.900 --> 15:49.980]  Then we put all of the plants into flower.
[15:49.980 --> 15:50.980]  Maybe not all of them.
[15:50.980 --> 15:52.820]  That is another issue that you've got to think about.
[15:52.820 --> 15:57.600]  It's going to take somewhere between 25 and 35 days
[15:57.600 --> 15:59.260]  for this plant to produce pollen.
[15:59.260 --> 16:03.860]  We want the female plants closer to day 23 to 30-ish
[16:03.860 --> 16:04.940]  when they get pollen.
[16:04.940 --> 16:05.900]  So time that out.
[16:05.900 --> 16:09.100]  You may wanna put this boy into flower a little bit earlier.
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.020]  Get him head started.
[16:10.020 --> 16:12.660]  Or this girl that is going to be a boy.
[16:12.660 --> 16:14.740]  This reversed female is technically what it is.
[16:14.760 --> 16:17.240]  We may wanna get him, her into flower
[16:17.240 --> 16:19.680]  a little bit more early than the other females.
[16:19.680 --> 16:21.840]  Let's get back on track with the plant we are spraying.
[16:21.840 --> 16:23.120]  We're gonna spray a plant.
[16:23.120 --> 16:25.640]  Spray it on a week before flower day.
[16:25.640 --> 16:28.580]  Then move it to the flower room on flower day.
[16:28.580 --> 16:32.440]  Spray it again the first day of flower.
[16:32.440 --> 16:34.160]  So whatever day you flip the lights,
[16:34.160 --> 16:35.960]  spray that plant again that day.
[16:35.960 --> 16:37.080]  Pull it out of the room.
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.120]  Spray it to run off.
[16:38.120 --> 16:41.680]  Then we are going to spray that plant every three days.
[16:41.700 --> 16:46.700]  So on day one, day four, day seven, 10, 13, and so on.
[16:46.860 --> 16:49.380]  Every three days you wanna spray that plant.
[16:49.380 --> 16:53.600]  I spray the plants approximately seven to nine times,
[16:53.600 --> 16:55.880]  including that first initial spray.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.140]  Something's clicking when I move,
[16:58.140 --> 16:59.820]  and I apologize if you can hear it in the recording.
[16:59.820 --> 17:01.980]  I think it's my headphone cable.
[17:01.980 --> 17:02.860]  It's driving me nuts.
[17:02.860 --> 17:04.540]  I hope it's not driving you crazy.
[17:04.540 --> 17:06.900]  So we're gonna spray the plants seven to nine times.
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.820]  Some plants that take longer to flower,
[17:08.820 --> 17:10.180]  some plants that are more stubborn
[17:10.180 --> 17:12.280]  will get 10 or 11 sprays.
[17:12.280 --> 17:14.320]  This comes with learning the plant.
[17:14.320 --> 17:17.280]  This comes with learning the dilution of the solution
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.840]  and the frequency of how often to spray that plant.
[17:20.840 --> 17:24.560]  I wish that this 90% diluted solution
[17:24.560 --> 17:27.240]  would work on every plant with seven sprays,
[17:27.240 --> 17:29.080]  but we're working with cannabis plants.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.840]  We're working with living things.
[17:30.840 --> 17:32.160]  They are picky.
[17:32.160 --> 17:34.320]  Some plants you can spray them
[17:34.320 --> 17:37.280]  with a really strong solution a couple of times,
[17:37.280 --> 17:38.920]  and they'll reverse very well.
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.860]  Some of them you have to spray them a lot of times
[17:40.860 --> 17:43.700]  with a very diluted solution, and they'll reverse better.
[17:43.700 --> 17:46.740]  The only way to learn this is by doing it to the plants.
[17:46.740 --> 17:48.780]  If you have a plant that you have chosen
[17:48.780 --> 17:51.880]  to be your pollen donor that you're going to reverse,
[17:51.880 --> 17:54.660]  I recommend taking several clones of that plant
[17:54.660 --> 17:58.080]  and treating it with different dilutions of the solution.
[17:58.080 --> 18:00.580]  Treat it with a 90%, treat it with an 80%,
[18:00.580 --> 18:03.900]  treat it with a eight to one, or a nine to one,
[18:03.900 --> 18:06.020]  and then an eight to two and a seven to three.
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.320]  Just start increasing the potency of your mix,
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.600]  or start increasing the frequency of your sprays.
[18:12.600 --> 18:14.980]  Then see how the plants react.
[18:14.980 --> 18:18.120]  You will see in the end which plant makes the most pollen.
[18:18.120 --> 18:19.260]  That's kind of what we're looking for,
[18:19.260 --> 18:21.400]  which plant makes the most pollen.
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.120]  The only way to really tell if this project was successful
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.320]  is to grow out the seeds which you produce.
[18:27.320 --> 18:29.820]  So let me recap just to make sure I got everything,
[18:29.820 --> 18:31.840]  because I'm going kind of quickly.
[18:31.840 --> 18:34.820]  We're gonna spray about a week before flip.
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.360]  Then we're going to spray again on day one,
[18:37.360 --> 18:38.840]  and then every three days.
[18:38.840 --> 18:41.800]  So day one, day four, seven, 10, 13.
[18:41.800 --> 18:44.920]  Continue until about day 22-ish.
[18:44.920 --> 18:47.680]  Sometimes if the plant doesn't look like it is reversed,
[18:47.680 --> 18:49.680]  or if it's not doing what I want it to do,
[18:49.680 --> 18:51.620]  I will continue the spraying.
[18:51.620 --> 18:54.520]  I'll continue to spray it maybe nine to 11 times,
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.560]  just depending on the plant.
[18:55.560 --> 18:57.380]  Some of the longer flowering plants,
[18:57.380 --> 18:58.560]  some of the more stubborn plants
[18:58.560 --> 19:00.640]  will get more sprays out of me.
[19:00.640 --> 19:04.200]  If you over spray, the plants will not produce pollen.
[19:04.540 --> 19:06.380]  They'll simply make pollen sacks that open up
[19:06.380 --> 19:07.340]  and nothing comes out.
[19:07.340 --> 19:09.020]  They fizzle out and the plants kind of dry up
[19:09.020 --> 19:10.100]  and look like shit.
[19:10.100 --> 19:11.500]  You won't get any pollen.
[19:11.500 --> 19:13.980]  Sometimes you'll spray them and immediately,
[19:13.980 --> 19:15.540]  the leaves will just crinkle up
[19:15.540 --> 19:17.120]  and look like complete shit.
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.740]  By the time you put it back in the grow room,
[19:18.740 --> 19:20.180]  those leaves are turning brown.
[19:20.180 --> 19:21.100]  You've over sprayed,
[19:21.100 --> 19:23.520]  the plant doesn't want that heavy of a dilution.
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.940]  So then you've got to lighten it up,
[19:24.940 --> 19:26.780]  and you've got to spray more frequently.
[19:26.780 --> 19:28.700]  And then you got to pay attention to those leaves.
[19:28.700 --> 19:30.300]  Sometimes the plants don't react at all.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.140]  You spray it and you go,
[19:31.140 --> 19:33.060]  I wonder if that's even doing anything.
[19:33.060 --> 19:35.240]  And then about 21, 24 days in, you start going,
[19:35.240 --> 19:36.560]  oh look, it's starting to make balls.
[19:36.560 --> 19:38.120]  It's starting to make male plants.
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.840]  Sometimes it takes even longer.
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.100]  So it's all about the plant.
[19:41.100 --> 19:42.680]  It's learning that female plant
[19:42.680 --> 19:44.000]  that you were trying to reverse.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.320]  We are really doing a lot to this plant.
[19:46.320 --> 19:48.320]  We are changing the hormones of this plant
[19:48.320 --> 19:50.760]  to make it do something it was never intended to do.
[19:50.760 --> 19:51.920]  So be patient with it,
[19:51.920 --> 19:53.360]  and you've got to adjust to the plant.
[19:53.360 --> 19:54.820]  I say this all the time.
[19:54.820 --> 19:56.080]  The plants are the boss.
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.280]  I wish I had an SOP that I could say,
[19:58.280 --> 20:00.900]  spray it at 90% at one o'clock on Friday,
[20:00.920 --> 20:03.080]  do it again at 2.30 on Thursday,
[20:03.080 --> 20:05.240]  and then feed it a cookie and everything will go magically.
[20:05.240 --> 20:08.080]  But again, these are plants, this is science,
[20:08.080 --> 20:10.540]  this is biology, this is horticulture and nature.
[20:10.540 --> 20:12.600]  There are a lot of variables to work with here.
[20:12.600 --> 20:14.880]  A lot of it depends on the female plant,
[20:14.880 --> 20:16.480]  like the breeding of the female plant.
[20:16.480 --> 20:17.920]  What are the genetics in there?
[20:17.920 --> 20:19.740]  If the plant can reverse too easily,
[20:19.740 --> 20:21.080]  maybe you don't want to work with it.
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.680]  So make sure you've got a solid tested female.
[20:23.680 --> 20:26.680]  Very important part is that you use solid tested genetics.
[20:26.680 --> 20:27.840]  Don't use any hermaphrodites,
[20:27.840 --> 20:29.840]  or you're going to make more plants
[20:29.860 --> 20:31.540]  with more intersex traits,
[20:31.540 --> 20:33.660]  and that's just going to mess up everybody's grow.
[20:33.660 --> 20:35.100]  Nobody wants that.
[20:35.100 --> 20:37.820]  So select good plants, test your progeny,
[20:37.820 --> 20:40.020]  and if you can't get a plant to reverse,
[20:40.020 --> 20:41.980]  that's when it's time to start thinking about
[20:41.980 --> 20:45.260]  that more expensive reversal spray.
[20:45.260 --> 20:47.620]  You guys, I feel like I went super quickly over that,
[20:47.620 --> 20:50.980]  but I feel like I covered all of the things we need to cover.
[20:50.980 --> 20:53.420]  Make the solution and start spraying.
[20:53.420 --> 20:55.900]  Don't get the solution on the other plants.
[20:55.900 --> 20:59.620]  Also, sometimes the silver thiosulfate solution
[21:00.360 --> 21:01.800]  will leave a purple stain behind.
[21:01.800 --> 21:04.000]  So if you're spraying against a wall,
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.980]  maybe you don't want that wall to turn purple.
[21:05.980 --> 21:07.160]  Maybe put something down,
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.200]  put some newspaper behind it or something,
[21:09.200 --> 21:11.540]  but spray until that plant runs off,
[21:11.540 --> 21:13.120]  then put it back in the room once it's dry.
[21:13.120 --> 21:14.720]  Don't get the other plants wet.
[21:14.720 --> 21:15.680]  I think I covered it all.
[21:15.680 --> 21:16.720]  You guys, I don't want to ramble
[21:16.720 --> 21:18.740]  and go back over anything unnecessarily,
[21:18.740 --> 21:21.280]  because I feel like I repeat myself a lot.
[21:21.280 --> 21:23.000]  That's so that everybody can learn.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.560]  I do want to thank my friend Joe.
[21:24.560 --> 21:25.720]  Let's read the email one more time
[21:25.720 --> 21:27.560]  and make sure we covered everything.
[21:27.560 --> 21:28.400]  How do you spray?
[21:28.400 --> 21:29.220]  How do you dilute it?
[21:29.960 --> 21:31.040]  How do you take different solutions
[21:31.040 --> 21:32.340]  and different intervals?
[21:32.340 --> 21:33.420]  I think I covered that.
[21:33.420 --> 21:35.280]  You're going to have to experiment with the plant.
[21:35.280 --> 21:37.560]  So I recommend taking clones of the same plant
[21:37.560 --> 21:39.040]  and just treating them all differently
[21:39.040 --> 21:41.160]  and take a lot of notes when you do that.
[21:41.160 --> 21:42.960]  Otherwise you don't know what you did.
[21:42.960 --> 21:44.760]  You don't have anything to reference later
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.160]  to see what worked for you.
[21:46.160 --> 21:47.600]  All right, that is my lesson
[21:47.600 --> 21:50.540]  on making your own silver thiosulfate solution
[21:50.540 --> 21:51.800]  to reverse your plants.
[21:51.800 --> 21:53.100]  I hope you learned something.
