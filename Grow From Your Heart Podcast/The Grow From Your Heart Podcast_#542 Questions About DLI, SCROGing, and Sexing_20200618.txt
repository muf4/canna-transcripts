[00:52.200 --> 00:54.300]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:54.300 --> 00:55.140]  What's up, man?
[00:55.140 --> 00:55.960]  Thanks for having me.
[00:55.960 --> 00:56.880]  Howdy, thank you for being here.
[00:56.880 --> 00:59.960]  Thank you for putting up with my ridiculously fun intro.
[00:59.960 --> 01:01.000]  That was a good time.
[01:01.960 --> 01:05.560]  Ran myself out of breath trying to be so enthusiastic.
[01:05.560 --> 01:06.940]  Yeah.
[01:06.940 --> 01:08.780]  Just to buy myself some breath catching time,
[01:08.780 --> 01:10.940]  what are you smoking on over there, bro?
[01:10.940 --> 01:12.840]  Just, I changed it up lately.
[01:12.840 --> 01:15.240]  I've been doing some local homegrown.
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.480]  Smoking flowers, are you?
[01:16.480 --> 01:18.600]  Yep, just sticking to flowers lately.
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.480]  Awesome, shout out to the local home grower
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.920]  for doing the good work.
[01:22.920 --> 01:25.660]  Yep, just some nice little local homegrown.
[01:26.060 --> 01:28.780]  Nothing too fancy, but hitting the spot.
[01:28.780 --> 01:30.060]  Well, I think it's fancy.
[01:30.060 --> 01:32.060]  I wasn't gonna diss the guy.
[01:32.060 --> 01:34.860]  No, it's just, there's some crazy shit
[01:34.860 --> 01:36.980]  going around in the weed world right now.
[01:36.980 --> 01:38.980]  Like I don't have cookies or nothing.
[01:38.980 --> 01:40.740]  I'm not into that fancy flower.
[01:40.740 --> 01:41.940]  All right, he's gonna listen to this.
[01:41.940 --> 01:43.260]  So shout out to the local home grower.
[01:43.260 --> 01:44.820]  I know who that dude is.
[01:44.820 --> 01:46.180]  He gets a shout out.
[01:46.180 --> 01:47.020]  It's fire herb.
[01:47.020 --> 01:48.900]  I gifted a little bit of it this afternoon
[01:48.900 --> 01:50.660]  and made somebody really happy with it, so.
[01:50.660 --> 01:53.940]  Cool, I love seeing people get happy over gifted herb.
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.380]  I am smoking, since you replied enough to ask,
[01:56.380 --> 01:58.940]  I'm smoking Purple Starburst Live Batter
[01:58.940 --> 01:59.940]  from Green Dot Labs.
[01:59.940 --> 02:02.940]  This is a blend of Purple Punch, Skittles,
[02:02.940 --> 02:04.760]  and Starburst OG.
[02:04.760 --> 02:07.860]  On the package, the flavor is described as spun sugar.
[02:07.860 --> 02:10.160]  I think that is cotton candy, right?
[02:10.160 --> 02:11.860]  Grapes and shampoo.
[02:11.860 --> 02:13.420]  I know it sounds weird.
[02:13.420 --> 02:15.560]  I enjoy that shampoo flavor.
[02:15.560 --> 02:16.400]  It's good.
[02:16.400 --> 02:17.300]  It sounds kind of weird.
[02:17.300 --> 02:18.140]  I really like it.
[02:18.140 --> 02:20.940]  The shampoo is what stands out the most for me.
[02:20.940 --> 02:23.500]  Cotton candy and shampoo, almost like strawberry shampoo.
[02:24.020 --> 02:26.140]  I think it's that old cheap strawberry swab shampoo.
[02:26.140 --> 02:27.100]  I dig it.
[02:27.100 --> 02:31.220]  On the back, it says it contains 54.84% THC
[02:31.220 --> 02:33.940]  and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:33.940 --> 02:36.180]  I'm digging the Purple Starburst.
[02:36.180 --> 02:39.140]  Starburst spelled with a Z, so nobody gets sued.
[02:39.140 --> 02:44.060]  Z-T-A-R-B-U-R-S-T, Purple Starburst from Green Dot Labs.
[02:44.060 --> 02:46.060]  It's obviously got me stoned,
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.620]  and it's doing that shit to my throat.
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.400]  That passes through the show.
[02:49.400 --> 02:50.380]  Yeah, it's got me going.
[02:50.380 --> 02:51.220]  Mike, when you're on the show,
[02:51.220 --> 02:53.540]  something just makes us fucking ramble together.
[02:53.540 --> 02:55.660]  I bet if we were in school, they would have separated us.
[02:55.660 --> 02:57.980]  We would not have been allowed to have classes together.
[02:57.980 --> 02:58.940]  They'd be like, those two guys,
[02:58.940 --> 03:01.900]  we gotta keep those two guys coughing, separate them.
[03:01.900 --> 03:04.340]  We're bad influences on each other.
[03:04.340 --> 03:05.180]  This is the point of the show
[03:05.180 --> 03:06.340]  where we should do some shout-outs
[03:06.340 --> 03:08.060]  to a few of the folks who continue
[03:08.060 --> 03:10.460]  to support the show on Patreon.
[03:10.460 --> 03:11.620]  Let's start off with the big, giant
[03:11.620 --> 03:13.180]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.580]  Thank you, shout-out to the hardest-working man in cannabis.
[03:15.580 --> 03:18.060]  Let's send a giant thank you shout-out to James Brown.

[03:19.420 --> 03:20.860]  for Godfather Kush.
[03:21.500 --> 03:23.780]  Let's send a big high five and a fist bump to Brett G.
[03:23.780 --> 03:26.500]  I always wanna send a big thank you shout-out to Jacob W.
[03:26.500 --> 03:28.340]  How about a big thank you to Kurt Z.
[03:28.340 --> 03:30.740]  How about a giant shout-out to Captain Mojo.
[03:30.740 --> 03:32.180]  We've always got a big thank you shout-out
[03:32.180 --> 03:34.940]  for everybody busting their ass out there at Hogan's Farms.
[03:34.940 --> 03:37.260]  Big thank you to my friend Melvin818.
[03:37.260 --> 03:39.700]  Big fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Dayron.
[03:39.700 --> 03:42.460]  Got a big thank you shout-out and a high five to Josiah.
[03:42.460 --> 03:44.060]  I've got a big fat thank you shout-out
[03:44.060 --> 03:48.180]  and a big fat dab for Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen.
[03:48.180 --> 03:50.740]  Big thanks, big shout-out, big fist bump

[04:21.180 --> 04:22.180]  and community.
[04:22.180 --> 04:23.500]  So help out my bro.
[04:23.500 --> 04:24.340]  Thank you, Mike.
[04:24.340 --> 04:25.580]  I do appreciate you.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.740]  Thanks, man.
[04:26.740 --> 04:29.500]  And thank you for everybody that's contributed so far.
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.980]  Yes, thank you to everybody who helps out Mike and myself.
[04:31.980 --> 04:33.340]  We do appreciate it.
[04:33.340 --> 04:35.500]  And I am working on freeing up more time
[04:35.500 --> 04:38.140]  so I can make even better and more content.
[04:38.140 --> 04:41.980]  And the Patreon contributions, money does buy time sometimes.
[04:41.980 --> 04:43.180]  So it's really helping.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.340]  That's, yeah, that is helping out.
[04:44.340 --> 04:45.180]  So thank you guys.
[04:45.180 --> 04:46.940]  And it keeps all this fancy equipment going.
[04:47.740 --> 04:49.980]  You guys bought Mike's recording equipment through Patreon.
[04:49.980 --> 04:51.340]  So thank you guys for that.
[04:51.340 --> 04:52.180]  Appreciate it.
[04:53.100 --> 04:55.300]  Something I should mention about Patreon questions
[04:55.300 --> 04:56.500]  and comments and shout outs.
[04:56.500 --> 04:58.180]  I do promise to give people shout outs
[04:58.180 --> 05:01.340]  if they contribute to the Patreon campaign.
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.980]  I also promise to read their emails
[05:02.980 --> 05:04.500]  and answer their questions.
[05:04.500 --> 05:06.980]  A lot of people have sent me a lot of great questions
[05:06.980 --> 05:07.900]  and emails.
[05:07.900 --> 05:09.980]  They do not realize that we are recorded
[05:09.980 --> 05:11.780]  several weeks ahead at this time.
[05:11.780 --> 05:14.540]  I think we are three weeks ahead of ourselves in podcasting.
[05:14.540 --> 05:16.700]  So I need to take a break and let us catch up
[05:17.460 --> 05:18.860]  so that the emails are fresher.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.380]  But your messages are coming.
[05:20.380 --> 05:22.100]  I did not forget you.
[05:22.100 --> 05:22.940]  You just gotta be patient.
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.660]  I only read like three or four per show
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.620]  and I probably get 25 per week.
[05:26.620 --> 05:29.060]  So the math means that I'm always going to fall behind.
[05:29.060 --> 05:29.900]  I'm not complaining.
[05:29.900 --> 05:31.140]  That means I've always got content.
[05:31.140 --> 05:34.060]  When the apocalypse comes, still got emails to read.
[05:34.060 --> 05:34.900]  It's not a bad thing.
[05:34.900 --> 05:36.580]  We just, patience, please.
[05:36.580 --> 05:38.060]  Yes, quality takes time.
[05:38.060 --> 05:39.460]  And I'm going to get to your message.
[05:39.460 --> 05:41.380]  I'm going to get to your Patreon shout outs.
[05:41.380 --> 05:42.340]  We're just ahead.
[05:42.340 --> 05:45.220]  So if you sent me a message in June,
[05:45.260 --> 05:47.460]  I just now, we haven't even gotten,
[05:47.460 --> 05:48.820]  we're already, I'm already recorded
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.980]  almost halfway through June.
[05:49.980 --> 05:51.820]  So it's going to be, I think you understand
[05:51.820 --> 05:52.660]  what I'm trying to say.
[05:52.660 --> 05:53.500]  My brain got ahead of my mouth,
[05:53.500 --> 05:55.660]  but I think my mouth got ahead of my brain.
[05:55.660 --> 05:56.900]  Either way, we're recorded ahead.
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.860]  So don't feel offended if I skipped your question,
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.180]  haven't gotten to your question yet,
[06:00.180 --> 06:01.900]  haven't given you a Patreon shout out.
[06:01.900 --> 06:03.020]  It's coming.
[06:03.020 --> 06:03.860]  Don't feel slighted.
[06:03.860 --> 06:04.900]  Don't feel offended.
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.420]  Don't cancel your Patreon subscription.
[06:06.420 --> 06:07.700]  That shit's coming up.
[06:07.700 --> 06:08.540]  Be patient.
[06:08.540 --> 06:09.660]  And that means that you got a whole,
[06:09.660 --> 06:11.620]  like a whole month of Patreon shout outs coming up
[06:11.620 --> 06:13.660]  if you've paid for a Patreon shout out.
[06:13.660 --> 06:15.260]  I think that covers that part of the business.
[06:15.260 --> 06:17.100]  Another thing I wanted to mention is,
[06:17.100 --> 06:20.420]  today I had the honor of recording on the Growcast
[06:20.420 --> 06:22.620]  with Jordan from the Growcast.
[06:22.620 --> 06:23.580]  That was a really good time.
[06:23.580 --> 06:25.100]  I had a fucking really fun chat,
[06:25.100 --> 06:28.020]  a really fun chat pre-recording and recording with him.
[06:28.020 --> 06:30.140]  I think that dude is a great recorder,
[06:30.140 --> 06:31.780]  a great podcaster and had a good time.
[06:31.780 --> 06:34.140]  So in the future, make sure you guys look forward
[06:34.140 --> 06:37.540]  to myself on the Growcast with Jordan River.
[06:37.540 --> 06:39.580]  If you're not already listening to the Growcast,
[06:39.580 --> 06:40.940]  make sure you download that.
[06:40.940 --> 06:42.420]  I think it is on Spotify.
[06:42.420 --> 06:44.500]  I know it's on Apple Podcasts
[06:44.500 --> 06:47.300]  and I think it's on most of the other podcast servers.
[06:47.300 --> 06:50.940]  He did agree to come be on my show on a video format.
[06:50.940 --> 06:53.420]  So in the future, look forward to myself
[06:53.420 --> 06:54.780]  interviewing Jordan River.
[06:54.780 --> 06:56.500]  Mike, if you'd like to tag team and join in,
[06:56.500 --> 06:57.660]  you're always invited.
[06:57.660 --> 06:58.940]  So that'll be a cool show.
[07:00.420 --> 07:02.940]  Now that we've got this Zoom recording mastered, man,
[07:02.940 --> 07:04.220]  the sky's the limit.
[07:04.220 --> 07:05.180]  Right?
[07:05.180 --> 07:07.380]  Yeah, I think we're really doing a lot better.
[07:07.380 --> 07:09.420]  Since we're talking about podcast servers,
[07:09.420 --> 07:10.660]  thank you, Mike, also for the compliment.
[07:10.660 --> 07:11.780]  I didn't mean to glance right over that.
[07:11.780 --> 07:13.140]  We are doing a lot better.
[07:13.140 --> 07:14.540]  Zoom makes a lot better show.
[07:14.540 --> 07:15.900]  You're a lot more comfortable.
[07:15.900 --> 07:17.980]  It makes it a lot easier for me as well.
[07:17.980 --> 07:19.780]  So good job to you, bro.
[07:19.780 --> 07:21.100]  Let me get myself back on track.
[07:21.100 --> 07:22.460]  I didn't mean to gloss over your comment.
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.660]  Trying to stay focused here and not Scotty real myself.
[07:24.660 --> 07:25.500]  Shout out to Scotty.
[07:25.500 --> 07:26.580]  I love you, bro.
[07:26.580 --> 07:28.300]  I mentioned Patreon a moment ago.
[07:28.300 --> 07:29.140]  Or not Patreon.
[07:29.140 --> 07:29.980]  What's the thing called?
[07:29.980 --> 07:30.800]  What is it?
[07:30.800 --> 07:31.640]  Stitcher.
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.460]  On Stitcher, a lot of people have notified me
[07:33.460 --> 07:36.740]  that episode 371 is errored on Stitcher
[07:36.740 --> 07:38.140]  and it's only a minute long.
[07:39.020 --> 07:39.900]  Bro.
[07:39.900 --> 07:43.420]  I have fucking deleted, replaced, edited, updated,
[07:43.420 --> 07:46.620]  fucking kicked and cussed at that fucking file
[07:46.620 --> 07:48.140]  and that upload service.
[07:48.140 --> 07:50.260]  I don't know why it won't work.
[07:50.260 --> 07:53.660]  It is the same RSS feed that works on iTunes
[07:53.660 --> 07:54.700]  or Apple Podcasts.
[07:54.700 --> 07:57.980]  It's the same RSS feed that works on Google Podcast
[07:57.980 --> 07:59.700]  or Google Play.
[07:59.700 --> 08:03.140]  Everything except Spotify runs off of that RSS feed.
[08:03.140 --> 08:06.700]  Everything else is accurate and correct except Stitcher.
[08:06.700 --> 08:09.620]  I don't know why Stitcher won't fucking do it, dude.
[08:10.060 --> 08:11.140]  I can't figure it out.
[08:11.140 --> 08:12.660]  Stitcher in this one episode
[08:12.660 --> 08:14.340]  just ain't ever gonna be friends.
[08:14.340 --> 08:16.100]  And you can email Stitcher
[08:16.100 --> 08:18.420]  and it takes them like three to 17 weeks
[08:18.420 --> 08:19.340]  for them to reply.
[08:19.340 --> 08:21.540]  They don't really care because I don't pay them anything.
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.840]  They're hosting my shit for free.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.520]  They don't make any benefit from contacting me or not.
[08:25.520 --> 08:27.500]  So they're not gonna fix it.
[08:27.500 --> 08:30.620]  So that episode, if you're listening today on Stitcher Radio
[08:30.620 --> 08:31.940]  and you're like, hey bro, I would have loved
[08:31.940 --> 08:34.100]  to have heard 371 because it's a great episode.
[08:34.100 --> 08:35.380]  You did wanna hear it.
[08:35.380 --> 08:37.180]  It's available on Spotify.
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.860]  And also I encourage you to check it out on YouTube
[08:39.860 --> 08:42.580]  because it is Jesse and myself sitting at the table.
[08:42.580 --> 08:44.060]  Many people have not seen Jesse.
[08:44.060 --> 08:45.020]  They don't know what he looks like.
[08:45.020 --> 08:45.860]  So you can come see what Jesse looks like.
[08:45.860 --> 08:48.180]  You don't wanna miss the Jesse episodes.
[08:48.180 --> 08:49.180]  Yeah, those are some gems.
[08:49.180 --> 08:51.500]  He actually messaged me today on Facebook and he said,
[08:51.500 --> 08:53.460]  hey, do you wanna do another outdoor episode?
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.540]  And I was like, fuck yeah, buddy, come on over.
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.580]  So I gotta get that recorded
[08:56.580 --> 08:58.340]  and don't say an episode number at the start of it
[08:58.340 --> 08:59.580]  so I can sneak it in whenever
[08:59.580 --> 09:01.220]  and try to fit it into the flow.
[09:01.220 --> 09:02.800]  Yeah, that way I don't have to make everybody wait
[09:02.800 --> 09:04.540]  too many weeks for that.
[09:04.540 --> 09:07.540]  But if you missed that one on Stitcher Radio,
[09:07.540 --> 09:08.900]  I wanna call it Patreon every time.
[09:08.900 --> 09:11.300]  The two logos blend together in my head.
[09:11.300 --> 09:13.060]  If you missed that one, I apologize.
[09:13.060 --> 09:15.660]  Thank you to everybody who emailed me, messaged me.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.260]  I got a lot of messages.
[09:17.260 --> 09:18.460]  My replies were short.
[09:18.460 --> 09:19.300]  Yeah, dude, I know.
[09:19.300 --> 09:20.120]  I'm trying to fix it.
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.180]  I fucking fixed it.
[09:21.180 --> 09:23.520]  I was trying to be, I tried to reply to everybody,
[09:23.520 --> 09:25.340]  but after a while I was like, dude, I know.
[09:25.340 --> 09:26.620]  And I'm trying to fix it.
[09:26.620 --> 09:28.300]  I just can't fucking, it won't fix.
[09:28.300 --> 09:30.220]  So we're just gonna have to live with that.
[09:30.220 --> 09:31.060]  Nobody's gonna die.
[09:31.060 --> 09:31.880]  Nobody got hurt.
[09:31.880 --> 09:33.140]  We can all live to podcast another day,
[09:33.140 --> 09:34.660]  but it's not gonna be fixed.
[09:34.660 --> 09:35.500]  So check it out.
[09:35.500 --> 09:37.460]  Somewhere else I think you'll like the video.
[09:37.460 --> 09:39.220]  Let me make sure I haven't skipped any other notes.
[09:39.220 --> 09:40.500]  I was on the Growcast.
[09:41.660 --> 09:44.500]  Dude, people like the music that we've been playing.
[09:44.500 --> 09:47.100]  I have been playing at the end of the show.
[09:47.100 --> 09:48.540]  I don't know if you watch the shows
[09:48.540 --> 09:49.380]  because you're on them,
[09:49.380 --> 09:52.380]  and sometimes it feels weird to watch a show you were on.
[09:52.380 --> 09:55.980]  At the end, I'm running like a clip of,
[09:55.980 --> 09:59.140]  it's a slideshow of strains of just weed pictures.
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.620]  And also sometimes I take a dab.
[10:00.620 --> 10:02.900]  And the other day I think I danced around to a fish song
[10:03.660 --> 10:05.580]  or to Stevie Wonder song for a couple of seconds.
[10:05.580 --> 10:07.220]  And somebody asked me to show my dreadlocks too.
[10:07.220 --> 10:08.140]  I forgot about that.
[10:08.140 --> 10:09.460]  I'll show my dreads in another episode.
[10:09.460 --> 10:11.220]  They're bundled up super tightly today,
[10:11.220 --> 10:13.540]  but I'll show them in another episode at the end.
[10:13.540 --> 10:15.500]  But people are impressed with the music
[10:15.500 --> 10:16.940]  that I'm playing at the end of the show.
[10:16.940 --> 10:18.700]  Unfortunately, we've got to quit doing that.
[10:18.700 --> 10:20.740]  Spotify doesn't like the music.
[10:20.740 --> 10:21.940]  YouTube doesn't like the music.
[10:21.940 --> 10:24.940]  We're getting this no, no, no finger at us.
[10:24.940 --> 10:25.980]  The bigger the company,
[10:25.980 --> 10:27.700]  the less cool they're gonna be with that shit.
[10:27.700 --> 10:29.020]  And the bigger the podcast,
[10:29.020 --> 10:30.260]  we've increased the listens.
[10:30.260 --> 10:32.700]  Audio and video listeners have totally increased
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.300]  by a large amount.
[10:34.300 --> 10:35.140]  So we're getting more notices,
[10:35.140 --> 10:37.180]  which is getting us higher up in the rankings,
[10:37.180 --> 10:38.820]  which more algorithms are seeing us
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.380]  and now they're messing with our stuff.
[10:40.380 --> 10:43.900]  So I'm no longer going to be able to put cool music
[10:43.900 --> 10:44.780]  at the end of the show,
[10:44.780 --> 10:47.900]  unless somebody makes me a kick in theme song.
[10:47.900 --> 10:49.820]  If you send me music that is original,
[10:49.820 --> 10:50.660]  I've said this before,
[10:50.660 --> 10:52.900]  I'll play your track at the starter at the end of the show,
[10:52.900 --> 10:54.780]  and you'll get compensated based on how cool
[10:54.780 --> 10:57.460]  your fucking track is and how many times I decide to play it.
[10:57.460 --> 10:59.620]  If you're a professional and you need money for sure,
[10:59.620 --> 11:00.700]  send me a sample.
[11:00.700 --> 11:02.380]  If you're kind, send me some tracks,
[11:03.060 --> 11:03.900]  I'll give you a shout out,
[11:03.900 --> 11:06.140]  I'll say your name and I'll send you gifts in return.
[11:06.140 --> 11:09.300]  But what I was getting to is somebody asked me for a list
[11:09.300 --> 11:11.140]  of the tracks, multiple people have asked me,
[11:11.140 --> 11:11.980]  what was that track?
[11:11.980 --> 11:12.980]  What was that track?
[11:12.980 --> 11:16.220]  I'm going to read a couple of short ones
[11:16.220 --> 11:17.580]  because the list is really long.
[11:17.580 --> 11:19.940]  I'll read a few of the most recent tracks I've played.
[11:19.940 --> 11:22.620]  Then I'm going to post to social media,
[11:22.620 --> 11:23.820]  the full list of tracks,
[11:23.820 --> 11:27.620]  because I've got it written down since 446,
[11:27.620 --> 11:29.780]  I started writing down which songs I was playing.
[11:29.780 --> 11:32.180]  So I've got the full list of every track.
[11:32.980 --> 11:34.300]  It's going to take me a while to tweet that.
[11:34.300 --> 11:35.700]  It may be like fucking 20 tweets.
[11:35.700 --> 11:37.140]  How many songs can I fit?
[11:37.140 --> 11:39.540]  If you've really got the list handwritten,
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.340]  take photos of the list and post that shit to Instagram.
[11:42.340 --> 11:44.340]  Just save yourself a year's worth of tweeting.
[11:44.340 --> 11:46.340]  See, the thing about that is this handwriting
[11:46.340 --> 11:49.420]  is kind of, it looks more like book code.
[11:49.420 --> 11:52.180]  And for some people, it's not going to do you any good.
[11:52.180 --> 11:54.780]  People like the Da Vinci code shit, don't get into it.
[11:54.780 --> 11:55.980]  Yeah, but it's still not going to,
[11:55.980 --> 11:58.140]  it's just going to be an artifact that doesn't mean shit.
[11:58.140 --> 12:00.580]  They're like, so what are those four letters in a row mean?
[12:00.580 --> 12:02.180]  It's like a fish song that nobody else understands.
[12:02.180 --> 12:04.140]  So they're going to need, they're going to need.
[12:04.140 --> 12:04.980]  So, and I don't even know,
[12:04.980 --> 12:07.420]  oh, RHM is Red Hot Mama from Widespread Panic.
[12:07.420 --> 12:08.860]  Yeah, that was one that I put on there.
[12:08.860 --> 12:12.940]  And then through 505 through 507, it says, shit I made,
[12:12.940 --> 12:16.500]  because those three fucking shows were tracks that I made.
[12:16.500 --> 12:21.340]  So let me just read, we'll start at five on the back.
[12:21.340 --> 12:23.140]  We start at 527.
[12:23.140 --> 12:25.780]  So 527 was called Fat Freddy's Drop.
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.260]  I didn't write down details guys.
[12:27.260 --> 12:29.740]  So I may not know either the artist or the track.
[12:29.740 --> 12:31.700]  I just wrote down enough to give myself a reminder
[12:31.700 --> 12:33.540]  so that I don't play that song again
[12:33.540 --> 12:35.420]  for like another 10 tracks or whatever.
[12:35.420 --> 12:38.540]  So Fat Freddy's Drop, that was recommended by a friend.
[12:38.540 --> 12:41.980]  528 was a Pearl Jam song, don't remember which one.
[12:41.980 --> 12:46.420]  529 was Government Mule, that is Warren Haynes, Matt Apps.
[12:46.420 --> 12:47.780]  Cannot remember the bass player's name.
[12:47.780 --> 12:49.260]  I feel like a dick for that.
[12:49.260 --> 12:51.500]  Matt's one of my favorite drummers, super awesome.
[12:51.500 --> 12:53.540]  Track 530 was the White Mike interview.
[12:53.540 --> 12:55.780]  I didn't put music at the end of that
[12:55.780 --> 12:58.020]  because I think we high-fived each other at the end
[12:58.020 --> 13:00.180]  or something, it sounded cool, so I cut that out.
[13:00.180 --> 13:03.540]  531 got a lot of notice.
[13:03.540 --> 13:06.980]  531 is a song called Bloodshot Eyes.
[13:06.980 --> 13:08.820]  Sorry for my bloodshot eyes.
[13:08.820 --> 13:10.460]  I did not write down the artist.
[13:10.460 --> 13:12.700]  I wanna say Through the Roots,
[13:12.700 --> 13:14.780]  but I could be completely wrong with that.
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.540]  Don't hold me accountable for that.
[13:16.540 --> 13:19.580]  But if you Google reggae song, Bloodshot Eyes,
[13:19.580 --> 13:20.420]  it will come up.
[13:20.420 --> 13:22.700]  They're a current reggae band, they're popular right now.
[13:22.700 --> 13:24.540]  I found it on Sirius XM.
[13:24.540 --> 13:25.900]  I was cruising home one night
[13:25.900 --> 13:28.020]  and that song came on on the reggae channel on Sirius
[13:28.020 --> 13:31.460]  on the joint, and I was like, that's a fucking good tune.
[13:31.460 --> 13:33.100]  532 is the Beastie Boys
[13:33.100 --> 13:35.260]  because I fucking love the Beastie Boys.
[13:36.180 --> 13:38.060]  533 was Damian Marley.
[13:38.060 --> 13:40.340]  534 was Fell on Black Days.
[13:40.340 --> 13:42.460]  You better know Fell on Black Days, bro.
[13:43.380 --> 13:45.460]  535 was Here Comes Trouble,
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.740]  and I think that is Chronix and Protege
[13:47.740 --> 13:49.460]  is who sings that together.
[13:49.460 --> 13:52.740]  536 was Say It to Me Santos by Phish.
[13:52.780 --> 13:55.780]  I think that was the live track from Dix
[13:55.780 --> 13:57.540]  at a show that I went to recently.
[13:57.540 --> 14:00.300]  537 was Brass Monkey by the Beastie Boys
[14:00.300 --> 14:03.140]  because Jesse was here and he made a comment about
[14:03.980 --> 14:06.180]  the Beastie Boys taught him that every picture is cooler
[14:06.180 --> 14:07.620]  if you point at the camera.
[14:07.620 --> 14:09.740]  And so when he said Beastie Boys at the end of the video,
[14:09.740 --> 14:10.700]  I left that part in.
[14:10.700 --> 14:11.700]  He thought I would edit that out
[14:11.700 --> 14:13.220]  because the show was technically over,
[14:13.220 --> 14:14.340]  but I left that short clip in
[14:14.340 --> 14:17.540]  and then I played the Beastie Boys just to make it fun.
[14:17.540 --> 14:21.580]  538 was Boogie on Reggae Woman by Stevie Wonder.
[14:21.580 --> 14:25.940]  539 is a track that I made and I just call it some reggae.
[14:25.940 --> 14:27.860]  It doesn't really have a real name,
[14:27.860 --> 14:29.260]  but those are the tracks most recently
[14:29.260 --> 14:30.460]  that I put on the show.
[14:30.460 --> 14:32.380]  Hopefully I got the one you're asking about.
[14:32.380 --> 14:33.220]  I will.
[14:33.220 --> 14:35.420]  It's gonna take a while for me to tweet all of that shit,
[14:35.420 --> 14:37.100]  but I'll tweet out the list or something,
[14:37.100 --> 14:39.020]  show you guys the rest of the tracks.
[14:40.500 --> 14:41.820]  Mike, I've been talking for a long time.
[14:41.820 --> 14:44.020]  We haven't even gotten to any cannabis content.
[14:44.020 --> 14:45.380]  Let's talk about weed.
[14:45.380 --> 14:46.860]  Wanna talk about growing weed?
[14:46.860 --> 14:48.580]  We should.
[14:48.580 --> 14:49.980]  I like to give garden updates.
[14:49.980 --> 14:51.060]  What's growing on, bro?
[14:51.860 --> 14:53.660]  I think we might've borrowed that from another podcast,
[14:53.660 --> 14:54.500]  but that's okay.
[14:56.140 --> 14:57.780]  I'm marking off the things that we've already done
[14:57.780 --> 14:59.460]  because I went out of order.
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.380]  Check off that list, homie.
[15:01.380 --> 15:02.820]  Yeah.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.780]  I like to give garden updates, dude.
[15:04.780 --> 15:05.620]  I have a garden.
[15:05.620 --> 15:07.540]  People know I'm a fucking ganja grower.
[15:07.540 --> 15:08.780]  I really like to give updates
[15:08.780 --> 15:10.700]  when I've got something cool going on.
[15:11.660 --> 15:14.980]  Recently we lost a very important cannabis soldier.
[15:14.980 --> 15:16.580]  Subcool is no longer with us.
[15:16.580 --> 15:17.700]  Subcool passed a while back.
[15:17.700 --> 15:18.540]  We cried over that.
[15:18.540 --> 15:19.380]  I did an episode about it,
[15:19.500 --> 15:21.180]  but I still love Sub, still miss Sub.
[15:21.180 --> 15:22.820]  Sub's still on my mind sometimes.
[15:23.700 --> 15:26.100]  I wouldn't be the breeder, grower, shit talker,
[15:26.100 --> 15:28.140]  podcaster, social media thing.
[15:28.140 --> 15:29.060]  I wouldn't be that guy
[15:29.060 --> 15:31.220]  without a lot of Subcool's influence.
[15:31.220 --> 15:33.660]  Subcool taught me a lot of what to do.
[15:33.660 --> 15:36.100]  I jokingly say that Subcool also taught me
[15:36.100 --> 15:37.980]  a fucking whole lot of what not to do.
[15:39.220 --> 15:41.620]  That guy was fucking cantankerous and a loose cannon,
[15:41.620 --> 15:43.420]  but I fucking love the shit out of him, dude.
[15:43.420 --> 15:44.460]  I wouldn't have been here without him.
[15:44.460 --> 15:47.820]  So I got some Jack the Ripper seeds from a good friend
[15:47.820 --> 15:49.060]  who was very close to Subcool,
[15:49.740 --> 15:52.260]  who actually thanked me for my podcast about Subby.
[15:52.260 --> 15:54.340]  He sent me some Jack seeds, Jack the Ripper.
[15:54.340 --> 15:56.620]  I germinated them right around 420.
[15:56.620 --> 15:59.820]  They are now under some Canon LED lights
[15:59.820 --> 16:02.380]  in a five by five tent that is my tester area,
[16:02.380 --> 16:03.220]  is what I've called it.
[16:03.220 --> 16:05.140]  Now it's my breeding chamber for today.
[16:05.140 --> 16:08.180]  I have got a stellar, stellar looking
[16:08.180 --> 16:09.620]  Jack the Ripper male, dude.
[16:10.820 --> 16:13.460]  This Jack the Ripper male is what I wanted.
[16:13.460 --> 16:14.580]  I planted five seeds
[16:14.580 --> 16:16.500]  and I found a killer male out of that pack.
[16:16.500 --> 16:18.380]  I've got a female that looks really well.
[16:18.380 --> 16:19.860]  They're gonna breed very well together.
[16:19.860 --> 16:21.260]  The photos look sick.
[16:21.260 --> 16:22.540]  Thank you, I'm glad you've seen that.
[16:22.540 --> 16:24.420]  They are under Canon LEDs.
[16:24.420 --> 16:26.940]  I've spoken about Canons on a previous episode.
[16:26.940 --> 16:30.300]  Those plants grow so vigorously under Canons.
[16:30.300 --> 16:32.860]  I should have flipped to flower like a week earlier
[16:32.860 --> 16:34.380]  because they're just taking off, dude,
[16:34.380 --> 16:36.020]  but the Canons are killing it.
[16:36.020 --> 16:37.020]  I love the Canons.
[16:37.020 --> 16:37.940]  Nice.
[16:37.940 --> 16:39.940]  I love it when a new piece of gear kicks off, right?
[16:39.940 --> 16:40.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:40.780 --> 16:43.140]  So I've got the new lights and a new male plant
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.660]  and a new environment and it's got me super excited.
[16:45.660 --> 16:47.460]  I'm always passionate and stoked about growing,
[16:47.460 --> 16:49.540]  but right now I'm like, woohoo, new shit.
[16:49.540 --> 16:52.900]  And I also changed my mom and veg space to Canon LEDs.
[16:52.900 --> 16:56.180]  So I've only got one more flowering area to go
[16:56.180 --> 16:58.340]  until we're all Canoned out in this place.
[16:58.340 --> 16:59.860]  So it's gonna be cool.
[16:59.860 --> 17:01.740]  And I think I may need to get some Canons in my friends
[17:01.740 --> 17:03.420]  to get them growing too.
[17:03.420 --> 17:05.260]  But I've got this Jack the Ripper male.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.660]  I'm super excited about it, bro.
[17:06.660 --> 17:07.500]  It's dumping pollen.
[17:07.500 --> 17:08.340]  It looks great.
[17:08.340 --> 17:10.860]  It's right about pollination time for the females.
[17:10.860 --> 17:13.380]  I do have, I haven't talked about the females
[17:13.380 --> 17:14.300]  that are in there too much.
[17:14.300 --> 17:17.220]  I like to keep my stuff kinda, not super secretive,
[17:17.980 --> 17:19.940]  but yeah, well, I feel like sometimes I've talked
[17:19.940 --> 17:21.740]  about projects and then they failed and I was like,
[17:21.740 --> 17:22.860]  oh, it's cause I talked about it.
[17:22.860 --> 17:25.460]  I gave it too much, like too much energy, too much hope.
[17:25.460 --> 17:27.660]  I put it on a pedestal and I fucked it all up.
[17:27.660 --> 17:29.420]  But I do have a Jack the Ripper male,
[17:29.420 --> 17:30.700]  a Jack the Ripper female.
[17:31.820 --> 17:35.020]  And there is an Arise female in there
[17:35.020 --> 17:37.820]  amongst several other females, not several, a couple.
[17:37.820 --> 17:40.420]  We're limited by plants here, but yeah,
[17:40.420 --> 17:43.060]  half my account is dedicated to this breeding area.
[17:43.060 --> 17:46.660]  So there will be some Jack the Ripper F2s.
[17:47.100 --> 17:48.140]  That's just for myself to like make more
[17:48.140 --> 17:48.980]  Jack the Ripper seeds,
[17:48.980 --> 17:51.220]  cause we gotta make more Jack because Subby's gone.
[17:51.220 --> 17:53.900]  And then I crossed, there are also my,
[17:53.900 --> 17:55.100]  there are other things in there, Mike.
[17:55.100 --> 17:56.540]  You'll be happy with what I put in there.
[17:56.540 --> 17:58.100]  One of your favorites is in there.
[17:58.100 --> 18:01.060]  So there will be some Irie Genetics Classics.
[18:01.060 --> 18:02.180]  More than one.
[18:02.180 --> 18:05.060]  Yes, yes, some Irie Genetics Classics crossed
[18:05.060 --> 18:07.660]  to one of Subcool's Classics.
[18:07.660 --> 18:08.740]  This will be not the first time
[18:08.740 --> 18:09.780]  that I've worked with Sub stuff,
[18:09.780 --> 18:12.140]  but the first time I've used his pollen.
[18:12.140 --> 18:15.580]  I was a serious Jack the Ripper fan.
[18:15.620 --> 18:17.620]  And it's just, it disappeared.
[18:17.620 --> 18:19.100]  It's not like I stopped being a fan.
[18:19.100 --> 18:22.260]  It's just, it stopped being widely available.
[18:22.260 --> 18:25.180]  And I cannot wait to see where this project leads.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.740]  All of the cookies and cake stuff.
[18:26.740 --> 18:28.860]  Listeners are as psyched as I am.
[18:28.860 --> 18:30.500]  Yeah, all the, yeah, yeah.
[18:30.500 --> 18:32.220]  I get, they are because I get messages.
[18:32.220 --> 18:34.940]  Every time I say it, they want testers.
[18:34.940 --> 18:37.340]  You guys, the pollen is just now starting to drop.
[18:37.340 --> 18:41.340]  I need weeks to get the seeds done, harvested, packaged.
[18:41.340 --> 18:42.380]  Then I will grow them.
[18:42.380 --> 18:43.820]  If they're worth a shit when I grow them,
[18:43.820 --> 18:46.860]  that's when I'll look to giving them out to testers.
[18:46.860 --> 18:47.940]  I'm gonna interrupt myself
[18:47.940 --> 18:49.620]  because I said something a minute ago.
[18:49.620 --> 18:52.140]  You said that the Jack the Ripper disappeared.
[18:52.140 --> 18:53.700]  And then I said it got overran
[18:53.700 --> 18:55.740]  by like cookies and stuff like that.
[18:55.740 --> 18:57.380]  That triggered a memory in my head.
[18:57.380 --> 18:59.780]  An episode or three ago, I don't know when,
[18:59.780 --> 19:01.380]  because we're so far ahead.
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.100]  I called a few strains hype strains,
[19:03.100 --> 19:05.940]  and apparently I offended a close friend.
[19:05.940 --> 19:07.340]  And I don't want to offend anybody.
[19:07.340 --> 19:09.980]  I said that a strain, I listed off strains.
[19:09.980 --> 19:11.300]  Then I was just rambling.
[19:11.300 --> 19:12.460]  I was putting words together.
[19:12.460 --> 19:14.140]  I was like, this sounds like a hype strain.
[19:14.140 --> 19:17.900]  I said two words together and my friend bred that strain.
[19:17.900 --> 19:19.660]  And I don't want to diss my friend.
[19:19.660 --> 19:20.940]  So no disrespect to you.
[19:20.940 --> 19:22.660]  Bro, you're listening to the show right now, I hope,
[19:22.660 --> 19:24.220]  or somebody will relay the message to you.
[19:24.220 --> 19:26.620]  He's a really popular girl where he's on YouTube.
[19:26.620 --> 19:29.180]  I don't need to, I didn't mean to offend you, bro.
[19:29.180 --> 19:30.780]  But it was all, I was just running names
[19:30.780 --> 19:31.700]  off the top of my head.
[19:31.700 --> 19:34.180]  And I said, this sounds like a fucking hype strain.
[19:34.180 --> 19:35.020]  Your shit's fire.
[19:35.020 --> 19:35.860]  I apologize, bro.
[19:35.860 --> 19:37.100]  Nothing but love and respect.
[19:37.100 --> 19:39.020]  I really don't have any beef with any breeders out there.
[19:39.020 --> 19:40.620]  I think all that shit is silly.
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.260]  But when I thought of cookies,
[19:43.060 --> 19:43.900]  I just thought it would be polite of me
[19:43.900 --> 19:45.260]  to fucking go ahead and apologize to my buddy.
[19:45.260 --> 19:47.340]  I said cake bomb was all hype.
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.420]  Cake bomb's not all hype, bro.
[19:48.420 --> 19:50.900]  Cake bomb is fucking all gas, no brakes.
[19:50.900 --> 19:52.460]  So fucking sorry, bro.
[19:52.460 --> 19:53.300]  I apologize.
[19:53.300 --> 19:54.140]  I'm just rambling.
[19:54.140 --> 19:55.300]  I picked a strain out of the fucking thin air.
[19:55.300 --> 19:56.500]  I pissed somebody off doing it.
[19:56.500 --> 19:57.540]  I'll be more careful.
[19:58.580 --> 19:59.620]  I'm sure he wasn't pissed off.
[19:59.620 --> 20:01.100]  I'm sure he was like, fucker, you just called.
[20:01.100 --> 20:02.820]  I'd be like, if somebody called a rise,
[20:02.820 --> 20:05.380]  I'd be like, hey bro, a rise is fucking hype meds.
[20:05.380 --> 20:06.900]  I'd be like, oh, ouch.
[20:06.900 --> 20:08.540]  Like, fuck, stop.
[20:08.540 --> 20:09.580]  That's my kid.
[20:09.580 --> 20:11.060]  It's like calling one of your kids a fucking,
[20:11.060 --> 20:12.020]  you know, the wrong word.
[20:12.780 --> 20:13.620]  I get it.
[20:13.620 --> 20:14.460]  I get it.
[20:14.460 --> 20:15.660]  Look at that little R word.
[20:15.660 --> 20:16.740]  Like, hey, wait, bro.
[20:18.100 --> 20:19.060]  Can't say that word anymore,
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.580]  especially about my fucking kid.
[20:20.580 --> 20:21.420]  Right?
[20:21.420 --> 20:22.580]  Why are you picking on kids, bro?
[20:22.580 --> 20:23.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:23.420 --> 20:24.700]  So sorry I picked on your child, bro.
[20:24.700 --> 20:26.820]  Nothing but love and respect.
[20:26.820 --> 20:28.260]  Keep killing it on fucking Patreon.
[20:28.260 --> 20:30.700]  The person I'm talking about kills it on Patreon
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.700]  and on Twitch and on fucking Patreon.
[20:32.700 --> 20:34.660]  I'm impressed with your Patreon, by the way.
[20:34.660 --> 20:37.540]  Okay, I'm rambling myself fucking all day long.
[20:37.540 --> 20:38.460]  My throat's gonna be too dry
[20:38.460 --> 20:40.260]  to even cover any cannabis topics.
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.820]  These rambles are brought to you by Dabbs.
[20:42.820 --> 20:43.820]  Big shout out to Dabbs
[20:43.820 --> 20:45.180]  and also a big shout out to our friends
[20:45.180 --> 20:46.860]  at seedsherenow.com.
[20:47.940 --> 20:49.900]  So Stitcher error covered that.
[20:49.900 --> 20:51.740]  Make sure you find the show on Spotify.
[20:51.740 --> 20:53.940]  I really prefer you check the show out on YouTube.
[20:53.940 --> 20:55.820]  I'm just trying to get most of the audience to YouTube.
[20:55.820 --> 20:57.500]  I understand you may be driving
[20:57.500 --> 20:58.780]  and unless you've got YouTube read,
[20:58.780 --> 21:00.420]  you can't lock your phone and close your phone
[21:00.420 --> 21:02.980]  and put it away or in your pocket or something and hear it.
[21:02.980 --> 21:05.500]  So I understand you may need to listen on Spotify
[21:05.500 --> 21:06.900]  or Stitcher or Apple Podcast,
[21:06.900 --> 21:08.980]  but if Stitcher fails you again,
[21:08.980 --> 21:10.420]  there are backup options.
[21:10.420 --> 21:13.020]  Spotify is free, it's available.
[21:13.020 --> 21:15.340]  There are other services that I will try to get the show on.
[21:15.340 --> 21:17.300]  It just takes, I had a technical issue
[21:17.300 --> 21:18.940]  and I, dude, I didn't know that I knew
[21:18.940 --> 21:20.700]  how to make an RSS feed and solve issues.
[21:20.700 --> 21:21.540]  I fucking did it.
[21:21.540 --> 21:22.700]  Matt was sitting here and he's like,
[21:22.700 --> 21:23.740]  why aren't you on Spotify?
[21:23.740 --> 21:24.940]  And I was like, this is my excuse.
[21:24.940 --> 21:26.780]  And I was like, I could do this.
[21:26.780 --> 21:27.620]  I could do that.
[21:27.620 --> 21:28.460]  Oh, I could do that.
[21:28.460 --> 21:30.180]  And within 20 minutes, my shit was on Spotify.
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.180]  I just had to take a couple of dabs and get the idea.
[21:32.180 --> 21:33.340]  Take a minute and think about it.
[21:33.340 --> 21:34.180]  Yeah.
[21:34.180 --> 21:36.340]  So I think we've covered all of the news
[21:36.340 --> 21:38.100]  and all the crap in the first start of the show.
[21:38.100 --> 21:39.780]  We're only like 20 minutes in now.
[21:39.780 --> 21:42.340]  I think we got caught up with the do list.
[21:42.340 --> 21:43.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:43.180 --> 21:46.180]  I think they call it housekeeping in the podcast business.
[21:46.180 --> 21:48.740]  Now we can actually move on to the edumacational
[21:48.740 --> 21:51.340]  and entertainment part of the podcast.
[21:51.340 --> 21:54.300]  I like to take questions from email.
[21:54.300 --> 21:56.940]  If you've got a question, the best way to get it to me,
[21:56.940 --> 22:00.100]  honestly, the best way to get it to me is through Patreon.
[22:00.100 --> 22:01.620]  Go for the appropriate tier.
[22:01.620 --> 22:02.500]  I've changed the pricing,
[22:02.500 --> 22:04.460]  but go for the question answering tier.
[22:04.460 --> 22:06.460]  Sign up, throw me your question on Patreon.
[22:06.500 --> 22:08.180]  The Patreon questions go first.
[22:08.180 --> 22:10.740]  Obviously, that's an expensive ticket to ride.
[22:10.740 --> 22:12.180]  You get to the front of the line.
[22:12.180 --> 22:14.300]  The next best way is to send me an email.
[22:14.300 --> 22:16.580]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[22:16.580 --> 22:18.780]  Yeah, laugh at me because it's a hotmail fucking,
[22:18.780 --> 22:20.580]  but all the other ones get hacked and broken into
[22:20.580 --> 22:22.260]  and Gmail failed me once and now I'm scared.
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.380]  So it's Hotmail, bro.
[22:23.380 --> 22:26.500]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com will get you right to me.
[22:26.500 --> 22:28.460]  I don't remember where I found this question
[22:28.460 --> 22:29.700]  because I didn't print it,
[22:29.700 --> 22:31.500]  which makes me think it came from YouTube.
[22:31.500 --> 22:33.620]  I love that people comment on YouTube,
[22:33.620 --> 22:35.700]  but it's more challenging for me to print them off
[22:35.740 --> 22:37.740]  because it wants to print the entire YouTube screen.
[22:37.740 --> 22:40.100]  Unless I catch it in the email, it's difficult.
[22:40.100 --> 22:41.460]  I'm not complaining.
[22:41.460 --> 22:44.300]  Third world, first world problems, white people problems.
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.940]  But if you really want me to get it,
[22:45.940 --> 22:47.420]  YouTube isn't the place to send it.
[22:47.420 --> 22:49.020]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com is the best.
[22:49.020 --> 22:51.260]  I did find this one on YouTube, I believe.
[22:51.260 --> 22:54.140]  And all I wrote down was DLI question.
[22:55.220 --> 22:56.340]  Somebody asked me,
[22:56.340 --> 22:58.780]  hey, Ross to Jeff, why are my plants drooping
[22:58.780 --> 23:01.460]  toward the end of the day cycle?
[23:01.460 --> 23:02.820]  A little bit before the light cycle,
[23:02.820 --> 23:05.500]  my start, my plants, my leaves start to droop down.
[23:06.300 --> 23:07.220]  They need water right before they go to sleep.
[23:07.220 --> 23:08.620]  Did I do something wrong?
[23:08.620 --> 23:10.900]  They were really worried about their plants.
[23:10.900 --> 23:12.020]  Mike, you look like you might know
[23:12.020 --> 23:12.940]  what's going on with these.
[23:12.940 --> 23:14.420]  Do you have any input on this?
[23:14.420 --> 23:15.620]  Nope.
[23:15.620 --> 23:17.540]  Oh, you look like you really fucking knew.
[23:17.540 --> 23:19.180]  I tried to give them more space to talk, bro.
[23:19.180 --> 23:20.220]  I've seen this before
[23:20.220 --> 23:23.820]  and I'm eagerly awaiting your diagnosis.
[23:23.820 --> 23:26.700]  Do you start to get droopy toward the end of the day?
[23:26.700 --> 23:27.540]  I do.
[23:27.540 --> 23:28.740]  The plants are doing the same thing.
[23:28.740 --> 23:31.300]  I think they'd be pissed if I gave them Red Bull though.
[23:31.300 --> 23:32.500]  Yeah, yeah, don't do that.
[23:32.500 --> 23:33.460]  Give them a nap.
[23:33.460 --> 23:36.900]  So what's happening is they have reached their,
[23:36.900 --> 23:38.540]  he's got that mountain dude going strong
[23:38.540 --> 23:40.540]  for you people only listening on audio.
[23:41.980 --> 23:44.260]  Daily light integral is,
[23:44.260 --> 23:46.820]  that means the daily light integral.
[23:46.820 --> 23:47.940]  They've had their amount of light
[23:47.940 --> 23:48.780]  that they want for the day.
[23:48.780 --> 23:51.180]  Your light is however far away.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.780]  Yeah, it's basically it, bro.
[23:52.780 --> 23:56.020]  They go, hey, I only want this many U moles per joule today
[23:56.020 --> 23:57.220]  and that is a measurement of light.
[23:57.220 --> 23:58.940]  Don't worry about PARs, don't worry about photons.
[23:58.940 --> 24:00.780]  What matters is U moles per joule
[24:00.780 --> 24:01.860]  and they've gotten enough.
[24:01.860 --> 24:03.260]  So they're starting to shut down.
[24:03.940 --> 24:04.860]  They're going, yeah, there's no reason for me
[24:04.860 --> 24:06.740]  to keep fucking photosynthesizing.
[24:06.740 --> 24:08.260]  I'm just gonna let my leaves hang.
[24:08.260 --> 24:09.180]  I'm gonna kind of take a rest
[24:09.180 --> 24:11.180]  and start doing the functions that I do
[24:11.180 --> 24:12.500]  during the night cycle.
[24:12.500 --> 24:13.620]  And then when the lights shut off,
[24:13.620 --> 24:15.860]  it's beautiful nighttime for them.
[24:15.860 --> 24:17.580]  So that is why the plants are drooping.
[24:17.580 --> 24:19.700]  They could be thirsty, but most,
[24:19.700 --> 24:23.300]  if it's happening like 15, 20, 30 minutes before nighttime,
[24:23.300 --> 24:24.620]  they've reached their.
[24:24.620 --> 24:26.780]  They'd be the other symptoms of thirsty.
[24:26.780 --> 24:27.620]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:27.620 --> 24:29.380]  It'd be easier to diagnose than this.
[24:29.380 --> 24:32.100]  Now, one thing that does happen in strains
[24:32.140 --> 24:34.740]  is that they're spread from my daybreaker.
[24:34.740 --> 24:37.060]  If that's something that came from the daybreaker line,
[24:37.060 --> 24:38.780]  because I cross stuff straight from daybreaker,
[24:38.780 --> 24:41.180]  I made daybreaker F2s and a few daybreaker things,
[24:41.180 --> 24:43.180]  a rise was made in that batch.
[24:43.180 --> 24:46.580]  So things that come from a rise also have the potential
[24:46.580 --> 24:49.900]  to make, if you get the big leaved phenotypes
[24:49.900 --> 24:52.060]  of crosses that come from a rise,
[24:52.060 --> 24:55.180]  those do have the potential to be a little bit droopy
[24:55.180 --> 24:57.140]  just because they're so big
[24:57.140 --> 24:58.940]  that like the plants don't have enough energy
[24:58.940 --> 25:01.260]  to keep that giant leaf turgid and upright.
[25:01.260 --> 25:03.100]  So it hangs a little tiny bit.
[25:03.100 --> 25:03.940]  Don't get worried about that.
[25:03.940 --> 25:04.780]  It's making me think of the lemon OG
[25:04.780 --> 25:06.340]  we used to work with all the time.
[25:06.340 --> 25:09.340]  Yeah, that fucker got big in the pre-98 Bubba Kush,
[25:09.340 --> 25:10.180]  used to make droopy leaves.
[25:10.180 --> 25:11.500]  Glitter bottle colas, and then yeah,
[25:11.500 --> 25:13.180]  it would get droopy at the end of the day.
[25:13.180 --> 25:14.260]  Yeah, and it was just tired.
[25:14.260 --> 25:15.940]  It was just like, nah, bro, these leaves are,
[25:15.940 --> 25:17.780]  the leaves are longer than my fucking foot.
[25:17.780 --> 25:20.940]  So they were like, I can't even keep the tip going anymore.
[25:20.940 --> 25:23.020]  It needed a little bit of plant Viagra on the leaves.
[25:23.020 --> 25:23.860]  It was just tired, bro.
[25:23.860 --> 25:26.420]  It was just getting a little plant ED, I guess.
[25:26.420 --> 25:28.900]  But what I think is happening for the person
[25:28.900 --> 25:30.420]  who asked me this question is,
[25:30.420 --> 25:32.300]  the plants basically need a nap.
[25:32.300 --> 25:36.300]  So you could, and I don't know the condition of your plants.
[25:36.300 --> 25:38.460]  I don't know how long your lights are on.
[25:38.460 --> 25:40.700]  If they are on for 24 hours a day,
[25:40.700 --> 25:43.580]  and you're seeing droop toward a certain period of the day,
[25:43.580 --> 25:44.700]  give them some nighttime.
[25:44.700 --> 25:47.260]  Start introducing some dark to your plants.
[25:47.260 --> 25:49.260]  If you're on an 18.6, maybe not,
[25:49.260 --> 25:50.860]  because then they may be telling you,
[25:50.860 --> 25:52.380]  I'm ready to start flowering.
[25:52.380 --> 25:54.300]  So be careful, start paying attention.
[25:54.300 --> 25:57.460]  If they're starting to droop at the end of that daytime,
[25:57.460 --> 25:58.900]  they're starting to tell you, hey bro,
[25:58.900 --> 26:01.020]  it is almost time for me to start flowering,
[26:01.020 --> 26:03.220]  unless you either put me in a bigger pot
[26:03.220 --> 26:04.140]  or something changes.
[26:04.140 --> 26:05.660]  They could be starting to get root bound.
[26:05.660 --> 26:07.180]  It could be one of the reasons they'll do that.
[26:07.180 --> 26:09.260]  But it's the daily light integral
[26:09.260 --> 26:10.580]  that is mainly doing that.
[26:10.580 --> 26:11.940]  If you put them into flower,
[26:11.940 --> 26:14.820]  you'll also see that happen toward the end of the day
[26:14.820 --> 26:16.860]  in flower, they will also start to droop.
[26:16.860 --> 26:18.340]  You can't really change the light cycle.
[26:18.340 --> 26:20.220]  So you gotta keep them on 12.12 there.
[26:21.620 --> 26:22.660]  Just keep giving them that light.
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.060]  They'll pump out those big old fat buds,
[26:24.060 --> 26:26.140]  but they've already processed as much as they can.
[26:26.140 --> 26:28.740]  So nothing wrong with your plants,
[26:29.580 --> 26:30.940]  but if they're in small pots and you're vegging,
[26:30.940 --> 26:32.020]  it may be time to up pot.
[26:32.020 --> 26:33.780]  That's the only thing I could recommend.
[26:33.780 --> 26:35.700]  But if everything else is in line,
[26:35.700 --> 26:37.300]  just enough light, you're cool.
[26:38.260 --> 26:39.620]  Next question, let's move right on.
[26:39.620 --> 26:41.420]  This one came from Patreon.
[26:41.420 --> 26:42.260]  Like I said before,
[26:42.260 --> 26:44.700]  Patreon is the best way to get your message onto the show.
[26:44.700 --> 26:46.660]  That is the ticket to the front of the line.
[26:46.660 --> 26:49.340]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[26:49.340 --> 26:51.180]  Also help out my buddy, White Mike.
[26:51.180 --> 26:54.380]  Patreon.com forward slash White Mike.
[26:54.380 --> 26:55.540]  This one came from Patreon.
[26:55.540 --> 26:57.340]  It comes from our friend.
[26:57.340 --> 26:58.700]  I'm gonna straight up say his name
[26:59.540 --> 27:00.380]  because he signed it.
[27:00.380 --> 27:01.220]  There's a lot of stuff in.
[27:01.220 --> 27:02.860]  I think his name is Craig Compton.
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.900]  And he said, hey, Ross DeJeff,
[27:03.900 --> 27:05.900]  I ran across your podcast and YouTube channel
[27:05.900 --> 27:07.020]  about a month ago,
[27:07.020 --> 27:09.420]  and I wanted to tell you that I am hooked.
[27:09.420 --> 27:10.260]  Thank you, bro.
[27:10.260 --> 27:11.580]  Glad you took the bait.
[27:11.580 --> 27:13.260]  It says, I really appreciate the way you present
[27:13.260 --> 27:14.420]  your knowledge, your passion,
[27:14.420 --> 27:17.300]  and your dedication to the plant and the industry.
[27:17.300 --> 27:19.260]  They are all a 10 out of 10.
[27:19.260 --> 27:21.860]  So we're getting 10 stars today, bro.
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.540]  Thank you for the compliment, Craig.
[27:23.540 --> 27:25.460]  It goes on to say, I'm a new grower.
[27:25.460 --> 27:26.620]  I'm a commercial grower,
[27:26.620 --> 27:29.380]  and I love to listen to people who can elevate my game,
[27:29.380 --> 27:31.940]  and you are now one of my faves.
[27:31.940 --> 27:32.780]  Thank you, bro.
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.980]  I like to educate and inform.
[27:35.980 --> 27:38.500]  And what I really like is knowing that somebody
[27:38.500 --> 27:40.860]  is getting educated and informed and enlightened.
[27:40.860 --> 27:42.380]  That feels good.
[27:42.380 --> 27:45.740]  I threw a dart, and I didn't know where my bullseye was,
[27:45.740 --> 27:46.740]  but I fucking hit it.
[27:46.740 --> 27:47.780]  So that feels really good.
[27:47.780 --> 27:50.460]  As somebody, an educator, a podcaster, a producer,
[27:50.460 --> 27:52.060]  a passionate person,
[27:52.060 --> 27:54.660]  those compliments all mean a lot of shit to me.
[27:54.660 --> 27:55.700]  A lot of good shit.
[27:55.700 --> 27:57.940]  So here's where this message gets really fun.
[27:57.940 --> 28:00.300]  It says, I almost spit my coffee on my windshield
[28:00.300 --> 28:02.300]  the other day when you said you had to stop listening
[28:02.300 --> 28:05.140]  to your guru because you started talking like him.
[28:06.100 --> 28:08.420]  I don't know if it was on this podcast or in a live feed
[28:08.420 --> 28:11.860]  or on Embracing Organics or in another platform.
[28:11.860 --> 28:13.900]  For a while, I was listening to a guy
[28:13.900 --> 28:16.340]  who was very educational and informative.
[28:16.340 --> 28:18.020]  I feel like I've got to educate myself
[28:18.020 --> 28:19.140]  with more knowledgeable people
[28:19.140 --> 28:21.100]  so that I can keep you guys educated.
[28:21.100 --> 28:22.820]  I got to get a lot of education sources.
[28:22.820 --> 28:25.180]  So I try to fill my brain with knowledge.
[28:25.700 --> 28:28.460]  I had a fucking bromance and a man crush
[28:28.460 --> 28:30.900]  on this fucking weed cultivator that I found.
[28:30.900 --> 28:33.820]  He was just filling my brain with so much great information.
[28:33.820 --> 28:36.300]  And I started, he's got a East Coast accent.
[28:36.300 --> 28:38.620]  I wasn't talking like the East Coast accent,
[28:38.620 --> 28:42.460]  but I was using his terms and his ideologies way too much.
[28:42.460 --> 28:44.900]  Like I caught it infecting, affecting my brain.
[28:44.900 --> 28:47.540]  Affecting with an A, I was affecting my brain
[28:47.540 --> 28:49.540]  and my speech and my thoughts.
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.620]  So I had to stop talking like, or listening to him.
[28:51.620 --> 28:52.900]  I had to cut myself off for a minute.
[28:52.900 --> 28:54.820]  I was like, no, no more of him for a minute.
[28:55.460 --> 28:56.740]  It's like, if you listen to the same rapper for a while,
[28:56.740 --> 28:58.020]  you probably, if you listen to Eminem,
[28:58.020 --> 29:00.020]  you probably start doing the Eminem, Eminem, Eminem.
[29:00.020 --> 29:02.140]  Start doing the Eminem shit eventually.
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.460]  If you listen to fucking whoever he is,
[29:03.460 --> 29:04.300]  if you listen to Metallica,
[29:04.300 --> 29:05.940]  you start playing fucking chin, chin, chin, chin, chin, chin.
[29:05.940 --> 29:07.140]  Just too much of that.
[29:07.140 --> 29:08.500]  So I had to quit listening to this guy.
[29:08.500 --> 29:10.500]  But this guy says,
[29:10.500 --> 29:12.820]  I knew immediately you were talking about Kev
[29:12.820 --> 29:14.020]  because I am the same way.
[29:14.020 --> 29:15.980]  And it made me bust out laughing
[29:15.980 --> 29:19.500]  that he has the same effect on you as he does me.
[29:19.500 --> 29:21.260]  I was talking about Kevin Jodry.
[29:21.260 --> 29:23.740]  I had to quit listening to Kevin Jodry for a while, you guys,
[29:23.740 --> 29:25.740]  because I started saying all of his words,
[29:25.740 --> 29:27.580]  his glossary, his dictionary.
[29:27.580 --> 29:29.180]  It all spilled into my brain.
[29:29.180 --> 29:31.660]  It wasn't a bad thing, but I wanted to be me again
[29:31.660 --> 29:33.020]  and stop being Kevin Jodry.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.260]  It was fucking me up.
[29:34.260 --> 29:37.260]  So this guy knew right away who I was talking about.
[29:37.260 --> 29:40.700]  He says he has the same effect as he does on me.
[29:40.700 --> 29:42.820]  I'm very fortunate to have crossed paths with Kev
[29:42.820 --> 29:45.260]  about five years ago and became very good friends with him.
[29:45.260 --> 29:47.460]  And over that time, I've spent many hours and days
[29:47.460 --> 29:48.740]  with him learning and laughing
[29:48.740 --> 29:50.820]  and smoking some great flower.
[29:50.820 --> 29:51.860]  He's my mentor and friend.
[29:51.900 --> 29:54.060]  I thank God every day for people like him
[29:54.060 --> 29:56.660]  and you who make me a better grower and person.
[29:56.660 --> 29:57.500]  Thanks again.
[29:57.500 --> 29:59.020]  I signed up for Patreon just to support you.
[29:59.020 --> 29:59.860]  Thank you, bro.
[29:59.860 --> 30:00.740]  That means a lot.
[30:00.740 --> 30:01.580]  You are worth it.
[30:01.580 --> 30:03.500]  And I look forward to the day we can hang out
[30:03.500 --> 30:07.740]  as well as bust out a fat dab or a fatty.
[30:07.740 --> 30:08.860]  Peace, love, and understanding.
[30:08.860 --> 30:10.420]  And then he signed out with his real name.
[30:10.420 --> 30:11.340]  Follow him on Instagram.
[30:11.340 --> 30:13.420]  He's Robert Gnarly on Instagram.
[30:13.420 --> 30:15.580]  And let's see, where else can we find him?
[30:16.700 --> 30:18.060]  He doesn't give us another spot to follow him.
[30:18.060 --> 30:19.060]  So that's enough spots.
[30:19.060 --> 30:20.380]  We gave him a good shout out.
[30:20.380 --> 30:23.300]  Craig Compton, thank you for the cool message.
[30:23.300 --> 30:28.300]  It means, dude, this guy listens and supports us
[30:28.420 --> 30:30.980]  while he's working alongside
[30:30.980 --> 30:33.620]  the Walking Talking Cannabis Encyclopedia.
[30:33.620 --> 30:35.900]  Like Kevin Jodry, Kevin is,
[30:35.900 --> 30:37.500]  if I can't figure something out,
[30:37.500 --> 30:39.500]  Kevin is who I would look to for answers.
[30:39.500 --> 30:41.380]  And this guy's standing next to him all day.
[30:41.380 --> 30:43.780]  This person still chooses to listen to us
[30:43.780 --> 30:44.980]  on our little podcast here.
[30:44.980 --> 30:46.260]  So that's flattering.
[30:46.260 --> 30:47.220]  That's a huge compliment.
[30:47.220 --> 30:50.220]  That's a huge, try not to let my ego swell too much.
[30:51.060 --> 30:51.900]  I'm getting older and trying to deflate
[30:51.900 --> 30:53.020]  and understand that ego,
[30:53.020 --> 30:54.900]  but it just got pumped up a little bit.
[30:54.900 --> 30:57.260]  You just put some fucking, some oomph to my ego, bro.
[30:57.260 --> 30:58.100]  So thank you.
[30:58.100 --> 30:58.940]  It's not a bad thing, bro.
[30:58.940 --> 30:59.780]  Yeah, I'm proud.
[30:59.780 --> 31:02.700]  I love it when the show helps people grow better.
[31:02.700 --> 31:04.500]  Like that's the whole point of the show.
[31:04.500 --> 31:05.900]  Exactly the point of the show.
[31:05.900 --> 31:10.260]  I was recently, I'll say subjected
[31:10.260 --> 31:13.340]  to some online weed forums.
[31:13.340 --> 31:17.740]  And holy fuck, the advice is just as bad as it was in 97.
[31:17.740 --> 31:19.460]  It's still shit.
[31:19.500 --> 31:22.500]  You must've seen some comments I left on a Facebook forum.
[31:24.420 --> 31:26.900]  It's still, it still seems like it's a whole bunch
[31:26.900 --> 31:29.860]  of mediocre growers giving people advice
[31:29.860 --> 31:31.340]  they know is shitty in hopes
[31:31.340 --> 31:34.180]  that they'll still have a market for their meds.
[31:34.180 --> 31:35.020]  Right.
[31:35.020 --> 31:37.220]  It's just that the advice is that bad.
[31:37.220 --> 31:38.060]  And it's okay.
[31:38.060 --> 31:39.780]  To know that there's people putting out
[31:39.780 --> 31:42.300]  the right information and it's reaching its target
[31:42.300 --> 31:43.180]  makes me happy.
[31:43.180 --> 31:44.300]  Yes, yes.
[31:44.300 --> 31:46.140]  It's okay to be a mediocre grower.
[31:46.140 --> 31:48.580]  Dude, I sucked at growing when I started.
[31:48.580 --> 31:50.580]  I sucked at playing the drums.
[31:50.580 --> 31:52.420]  I sucked at podcasting.
[31:52.420 --> 31:54.420]  Yeah, we all, I say I sucked at,
[31:54.420 --> 31:56.460]  I don't take karate, I'm not a fucking ninja.
[31:56.460 --> 31:57.980]  When I was a kid, I took karate.
[31:57.980 --> 31:58.860]  I sucked at karate.
[31:58.860 --> 31:59.820]  I was a white belt.
[31:59.820 --> 32:00.780]  My kicks were sloppy.
[32:00.780 --> 32:01.860]  My form was terrible.
[32:01.860 --> 32:03.020]  Dude, after a few years,
[32:03.020 --> 32:05.060]  I was throwing fucking head kicks in tournaments.
[32:05.060 --> 32:06.740]  Like you gotta suck for a little bit.
[32:06.740 --> 32:10.300]  At everything you do, it feels good to suck at stuff.
[32:10.300 --> 32:12.500]  Like I've got such a good grasp on podcasting,
[32:12.500 --> 32:14.980]  growing, fucking playing the drums
[32:14.980 --> 32:16.780]  that when I try to pick up a guitar,
[32:17.100 --> 32:20.300]  this is hard and it makes my brain go, yeah.
[32:20.300 --> 32:23.300]  And I wanna fucking get good at it and figure it out.
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.860]  It's okay to suck at shit.
[32:24.860 --> 32:27.460]  What you shouldn't do if you suck at stuff
[32:27.460 --> 32:30.460]  is tell other people how to suck at things also.
[32:30.460 --> 32:32.060]  You don't have to have an answer.
[32:32.060 --> 32:32.900]  Mike, if I go-
[32:32.900 --> 32:34.220]  Tell other people how to do it worse
[32:34.220 --> 32:36.300]  to make your suckage appear better.
[32:36.300 --> 32:39.620]  What are, what notes do I tune my guitar to, Mike?
[32:39.620 --> 32:40.460]  I don't know.
[32:40.460 --> 32:43.180]  See, you could have said F, R, T, M, and Q
[32:43.180 --> 32:44.220]  if you really wanted.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.060]  Yeah, but instead-
[32:45.060 --> 32:45.900]  I put it on seven, bro.
[32:45.900 --> 32:49.180]  You fucking adulted, you manned up and went, I don't know.
[32:49.180 --> 32:52.220]  Hey Mike, how many states have legal cannabis?
[32:52.220 --> 32:54.500]  I should know, but I don't remember off the top of my head.
[32:54.500 --> 32:55.340]  36.
[32:55.340 --> 32:57.100]  But see, you could, you see, you're qualified enough
[32:57.100 --> 32:59.620]  to do the research and give me a ballpark answer.
[32:59.620 --> 33:03.420]  Yeah, I could check and be sure, but like-
[33:03.420 --> 33:04.260]  How old are your kids?
[33:04.260 --> 33:05.860]  How legal are you talking?
[33:05.860 --> 33:06.980]  Two and almost five.
[33:06.980 --> 33:07.820]  That's what I know.
[33:07.820 --> 33:08.660]  You're a fucking expert.
[33:08.660 --> 33:11.940]  No, you should answer questions on forums about your kids.
[33:11.940 --> 33:14.620]  You can chime in about legal states.
[33:14.620 --> 33:16.980]  Shut the hell up when it comes to tuning guitars.
[33:16.980 --> 33:19.500]  Yeah, if more people took that advice,
[33:19.500 --> 33:20.820]  the world would be a way fucking better place.
[33:20.820 --> 33:22.940]  Yeah, and that's the only thing that,
[33:22.940 --> 33:23.900]  I can't say that's the only,
[33:23.900 --> 33:24.980]  I'm sure that's not the only thing.
[33:24.980 --> 33:26.980]  That is the real issue that bugs me
[33:26.980 --> 33:29.180]  on social media grow platforms.
[33:29.180 --> 33:32.340]  People will say, my uncle's brother tried to put this
[33:32.340 --> 33:33.660]  in his soil and it worked for him,
[33:33.660 --> 33:35.060]  so that'll solve all your problems.
[33:35.060 --> 33:36.660]  And I'm like, you just told them that
[33:36.660 --> 33:38.260]  that's gonna kill all the plants.
[33:38.260 --> 33:39.500]  Like, I hope you didn't do this yet.
[33:39.500 --> 33:42.620]  Can I reply quicker and get my word in before you do this?
[33:43.580 --> 33:45.140]  But it worries me.
[33:45.140 --> 33:47.740]  Like all social media is pretty toxic right now,
[33:47.740 --> 33:50.860]  but the growth forums,
[33:50.860 --> 33:54.140]  I gotta think it's that the financial incentive,
[33:54.140 --> 33:56.060]  because everybody sort of understands
[33:56.060 --> 33:59.220]  that there's a limited number of cannabis consumers out there
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.700]  and everybody's selling the same product.
[34:01.700 --> 34:03.540]  And if somebody asks you for advice,
[34:03.540 --> 34:04.900]  and you're like, no, I'll set it on fire,
[34:04.900 --> 34:06.700]  take it out back and kick it.
[34:06.700 --> 34:08.260]  Like that makes your shit,
[34:08.260 --> 34:10.580]  even if it's mediocre, a little bit more, I don't know.
[34:10.620 --> 34:13.340]  It's just the advice is so bad, it's insane.
[34:13.340 --> 34:15.580]  The advice on other topics is usually bad,
[34:15.580 --> 34:18.460]  but it's not like this bad.
[34:19.780 --> 34:22.500]  And I'm trying to be a more positive person,
[34:22.500 --> 34:23.660]  but it's a good time to vent.
[34:23.660 --> 34:24.740]  This drives me crazy.
[34:24.740 --> 34:26.540]  Somebody posts a picture of a plant.
[34:26.540 --> 34:28.180]  It's got a minor problem.
[34:28.180 --> 34:30.100]  The first person says spider mites.
[34:30.100 --> 34:31.260]  They don't have spider mites.
[34:31.260 --> 34:33.300]  So now they're paranoid about spider mites.
[34:33.300 --> 34:35.300]  Second person says thrips.
[34:35.300 --> 34:37.300]  Third person says bad soil.
[34:37.300 --> 34:39.460]  Fourth person says wrong light.
[34:39.460 --> 34:41.540]  Now this person is spraying for mites
[34:41.540 --> 34:43.540]  and spraying for thrips and changing their soil
[34:43.540 --> 34:46.980]  and buying new lights when really it was too hot.
[34:46.980 --> 34:48.060]  Well, and their plant dies
[34:48.060 --> 34:49.940]  because they did 11 things to it on the same day.
[34:49.940 --> 34:52.460]  Yeah, and so I'm like, please be careful.
[34:52.460 --> 34:54.460]  So guys, my bottom line, my point here,
[34:55.420 --> 34:57.740]  just be careful when you're fucking looking online
[34:57.740 --> 34:58.660]  for advice.
[34:58.660 --> 35:01.380]  Like there are a lot of things that people will say,
[35:01.380 --> 35:03.100]  go look at the pictures of their garden.
[35:03.100 --> 35:05.940]  Go look, if they can't spell leaves with a V,
[35:05.940 --> 35:07.620]  if they put an F in the word leaves,
[35:07.620 --> 35:08.980]  don't fucking take their advice.
[35:09.020 --> 35:11.100]  Like that's, sorry.
[35:11.100 --> 35:14.340]  It's easier with other topics.
[35:14.340 --> 35:18.020]  With cannabis, it's still fringy enough
[35:18.020 --> 35:20.020]  that sometimes it's hard to tell.
[35:20.020 --> 35:23.060]  Like proper grammar is not always indicative
[35:23.060 --> 35:24.340]  of proper knowledge.
[35:25.180 --> 35:27.660]  It's not quite as obvious as it is in like in politics.
[35:27.660 --> 35:28.820]  With politics, it's quick.
[35:28.820 --> 35:31.300]  When people start talking about impeaching laws
[35:31.300 --> 35:33.540]  and you're like, do you mean repeal, bitch?
[35:33.540 --> 35:34.860]  Yeah.
[35:34.860 --> 35:36.460]  It's a little bit more obvious
[35:36.460 --> 35:38.020]  than it is in the cannabis world.
[35:38.020 --> 35:39.940]  But usually if you pay attention,
[35:39.940 --> 35:43.540]  you take a minute and check two or three reliable sources,
[35:43.540 --> 35:45.220]  you'll get the info you want.
[35:45.220 --> 35:46.780]  But just be super careful
[35:46.780 --> 35:48.940]  if you're asking a social media forum
[35:48.940 --> 35:50.700]  about a cannabis growing question,
[35:50.700 --> 35:52.180]  because 80% of those answers
[35:52.180 --> 35:54.500]  are designed to fuck up your plans.
[35:54.500 --> 35:56.300]  I don't know if they're really designed that way
[35:56.300 --> 35:58.540]  or if they're actually that misinformed.
[35:58.540 --> 36:00.420]  Like I would like to hope they're not targeting
[36:00.420 --> 36:01.660]  to thank you fail.
[36:01.660 --> 36:02.500]  All right, I should move forward
[36:02.500 --> 36:04.220]  from ranting about social media.
[36:04.220 --> 36:06.500]  Honestly, dude, social media,
[36:06.540 --> 36:10.460]  people talking about feminized seeds in such an,
[36:10.460 --> 36:12.180]  I think ignorant is the appropriate word.
[36:12.180 --> 36:13.380]  Ignorant means misinformed.
[36:13.380 --> 36:14.540]  It's not an insult.
[36:14.540 --> 36:17.500]  They're very ignorant about feminized seeds.
[36:17.500 --> 36:19.180]  They have frustrated me enough
[36:19.180 --> 36:22.260]  to where I am going to do a full episode
[36:22.260 --> 36:26.980]  on feminized seeds and detailed on how I make them
[36:26.980 --> 36:28.580]  so that it's understood,
[36:28.580 --> 36:30.780]  so that people aren't using the wrong terms
[36:30.780 --> 36:31.620]  and wrong assumptions.
[36:31.620 --> 36:32.940]  I want to correct it.
[36:32.940 --> 36:36.260]  So that's maybe it worked for them
[36:37.020 --> 36:37.860]  and giving all this terrible advice
[36:37.860 --> 36:39.420]  frustrated me enough to go,
[36:39.420 --> 36:41.380]  okay, children, here's how it works.
[36:41.380 --> 36:42.220]  It's like if you,
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.540]  if I know that the best way
[36:43.540 --> 36:45.620]  to get one of my comedian friends to tell a joke
[36:45.620 --> 36:47.780]  is to start telling his joke wrong.
[36:49.020 --> 36:50.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:50.100 --> 36:51.300]  Like if you're,
[36:51.300 --> 36:52.980]  you know I hang out with some of the comedian nerds, right?
[36:52.980 --> 36:53.820]  So start telling-
[36:53.820 --> 36:55.420]  No, I know, it's a good analogy.
[36:55.420 --> 36:56.700]  Start telling one of their bits, bro.
[36:56.700 --> 36:57.620]  And they'll be, you're fucking it up.
[36:57.620 --> 36:58.460]  It goes like this.
[36:58.460 --> 36:59.300]  And I just sit back
[36:59.300 --> 37:00.980]  and then I get to watch them tell their joke.
[37:00.980 --> 37:01.820]  Like, oh, thank you.
[37:01.820 --> 37:03.620]  Now I get to hear you do comedy now.
[37:03.620 --> 37:04.900]  And I get to enjoy it.
[37:04.900 --> 37:05.740]  Yeah.
[37:06.260 --> 37:07.100]  And I'm like, we're super rambly.
[37:07.100 --> 37:08.340]  I've got no deadline today.
[37:08.340 --> 37:11.580]  So let's get right into another message.
[37:11.580 --> 37:12.700]  This one comes from,
[37:12.700 --> 37:14.340]  what did they sign it with?
[37:14.340 --> 37:15.740]  No, they're writing from Prohibition Land.
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.580]  So we're not going to even hit their name.
[37:17.580 --> 37:18.460]  What's up Prohibition Land?
[37:18.460 --> 37:20.100]  And somebody sent me an email the other day
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.420]  and it said, I am in PL.
[37:21.420 --> 37:23.140]  And I was like, bro, I don't, where's PL?
[37:23.140 --> 37:24.380]  Like Prohibition Land, motherfucker.
[37:24.380 --> 37:26.420]  And I was like, sorry, I'm high.
[37:26.420 --> 37:27.980]  I'm fucking stupid if I didn't get that.
[37:27.980 --> 37:29.340]  I apologize.
[37:29.340 --> 37:31.540]  From Prohibition Land says like this,
[37:31.540 --> 37:33.780]  Rasta Jeff, I love everything you do, brother.
[37:33.820 --> 37:36.580]  I'm writing from East Coast Prohibition Land.
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.460]  I'll keep it short since you're busy.
[37:38.460 --> 37:39.300]  Thank you.
[37:39.300 --> 37:40.140]  I do appreciate that.
[37:40.140 --> 37:43.540]  First, if you think your perpetual grow lesson
[37:43.540 --> 37:47.420]  was worth money, then your breeding lessons was priceless.
[37:47.420 --> 37:48.260]  Dude, that's awesome.
[37:48.260 --> 37:49.100]  Thank you.
[37:49.100 --> 37:50.020]  I think I made a joke one time
[37:50.020 --> 37:53.460]  about my perpetual grow lesson being worth a million bucks.
[37:53.460 --> 37:54.500]  Or if I would have written a book,
[37:54.500 --> 37:56.380]  that would have been the cash cow right there.
[37:56.380 --> 37:57.220]  That was old school.
[37:57.220 --> 37:58.700]  So you've been listening for a while
[37:58.700 --> 38:01.380]  and I'm glad you enjoyed the breeding labels lesson.
[38:01.380 --> 38:04.140]  I kind of went over that on two other podcasts today.
[38:04.140 --> 38:05.900]  We talked about that on Embracing Organics.
[38:05.900 --> 38:09.380]  We also talked about that on the Growcast with Jordan River.
[38:09.380 --> 38:11.620]  So fun topic that keeps coming up.
[38:11.620 --> 38:12.900]  I'm gonna get myself back on track.
[38:12.900 --> 38:15.380]  It says, dude, I listened to it twice back to back
[38:15.380 --> 38:17.020]  just for the A and B line lesson.
[38:17.020 --> 38:19.740]  And I will listen many more times for a refresher.
[38:19.740 --> 38:20.580]  I love that.
[38:20.580 --> 38:21.700]  Keep clicking on it, bro.
[38:21.700 --> 38:22.540]  Listen on YouTube.
[38:22.540 --> 38:24.260]  Give me more listens and views.
[38:24.260 --> 38:25.980]  That episode is my absolute favorite
[38:25.980 --> 38:28.180]  and I will spread the word about your podcast
[38:28.180 --> 38:30.100]  to anyone who will listen, my friend.
[38:30.100 --> 38:30.940]  I love that.
[38:31.700 --> 38:32.700]  Yeah, don't run off your friends
[38:32.700 --> 38:35.140]  by rambling too much about it, but encourage them.
[38:35.140 --> 38:36.380]  So it goes on to say,
[38:36.380 --> 38:37.940]  I grew in a basement for about 10 years
[38:37.940 --> 38:39.420]  and I had to stop for six.
[38:39.420 --> 38:42.020]  I started again, then I started again.
[38:42.020 --> 38:43.580]  It says why he had to stop,
[38:43.580 --> 38:44.980]  but I don't know if I'm supposed to read that
[38:44.980 --> 38:46.460]  because it's in parentheses.
[38:46.460 --> 38:50.420]  It says now I'm allegedly in week two of my,
[38:50.420 --> 38:52.340]  week two of flower on my third attempt.
[38:52.340 --> 38:55.140]  I've got four New York diesel in a four by three tent.
[38:55.140 --> 38:56.900]  Everything looks good for this one.
[38:56.900 --> 38:58.020]  Bro, I've seen your past
[38:58.020 --> 39:00.420]  and I hope this one is much more successful.
[39:00.780 --> 39:01.700]  Fingers crossed.
[39:01.700 --> 39:03.780]  Yeah, toes crossed, jaw love.
[39:03.780 --> 39:06.780]  I am fairly experienced, but this is my first trellis grow.
[39:06.780 --> 39:09.060]  So they've got a trellis, a netting system.
[39:09.060 --> 39:10.780]  I just installed my second trellis.
[39:10.780 --> 39:12.820]  So they got a first one, hopefully spreading it.
[39:12.820 --> 39:14.940]  The second one kind of giving it support.
[39:14.940 --> 39:17.020]  It says I listened to all of your Scrog lessons,
[39:17.020 --> 39:18.620]  but I have a quick question.
[39:18.620 --> 39:20.620]  All right, this is where the questions come in.
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.780]  Is it okay if some of my buds are woven through the trellis
[39:24.780 --> 39:26.300]  or should I only be weaving
[39:26.300 --> 39:28.820]  so only the branch material is touching the trellis?
[39:28.820 --> 39:30.380]  I hope this makes sense.
[39:31.220 --> 39:32.580]  I'm trying to keep the canopy super low.
[39:32.580 --> 39:34.820]  I'm just worried that I'm keeping some of the buds caught
[39:34.820 --> 39:35.860]  in the trellis.
[39:35.860 --> 39:38.780]  I work on a 2,500 acre fresh produce farm,
[39:38.780 --> 39:40.500]  but I come home to a four by three tent.
[39:40.500 --> 39:42.340]  Bro, that is passion right there.
[39:42.340 --> 39:44.420]  I wish every day that these rows were golden goat
[39:44.420 --> 39:45.700]  or lemon Jeffrey.
[39:45.700 --> 39:46.540]  Thank you, bro.
[39:46.540 --> 39:48.380]  I wish you much love.
[39:48.380 --> 39:49.540]  Shout out from our friend out there
[39:49.540 --> 39:51.500]  in East Coast prohibition land.
[39:51.500 --> 39:53.540]  Let's talk about this for a minute, Mike.
[39:54.460 --> 39:56.100]  One of the, the first thing I thought was,
[39:56.100 --> 39:56.940]  yeah, it's okay.
[39:56.940 --> 39:58.300]  You're gonna get, your buds are gonna grow
[39:58.300 --> 40:00.180]  into your trellis occasionally.
[40:00.980 --> 40:01.820]  You get the little nodules,
[40:01.820 --> 40:03.860]  the stick comes up and the bud branches off of there.
[40:03.860 --> 40:05.460]  And instead of it just growing straight,
[40:05.460 --> 40:07.660]  it happens to catch the part of this trellis
[40:07.660 --> 40:08.740]  and it just grows around it.
[40:08.740 --> 40:09.580]  That's fine.
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.860]  You're just gonna have to cut that out at the end of flower.
[40:10.860 --> 40:12.140]  Be careful.
[40:12.140 --> 40:13.860]  Something that did catch my attention though,
[40:13.860 --> 40:16.700]  you said that you're still weaving it through
[40:16.700 --> 40:17.940]  and you're in flower.
[40:17.940 --> 40:20.060]  Be very careful doing that.
[40:20.060 --> 40:23.180]  If you're in flower far enough to have chunky bud set,
[40:23.180 --> 40:25.780]  you should have already be woven up through there.
[40:25.780 --> 40:28.340]  That's part of what got my attention.
[40:28.340 --> 40:30.780]  So I'm gonna read it again.
[40:30.780 --> 40:34.540]  Only, I only be weaving or should I only be weaving
[40:34.540 --> 40:37.420]  so only the branch material is touching the trellis?
[40:38.660 --> 40:41.940]  I read that or listening to you read that,
[40:41.940 --> 40:44.380]  it sounded like he was talking about his setup.
[40:44.380 --> 40:46.140]  So should he weave it through
[40:46.140 --> 40:49.940]  so that when it starts to flower out heavily,
[40:49.940 --> 40:52.180]  all of the flowering material is off
[40:52.180 --> 40:54.300]  and it's mostly stick hitting trellis.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.140]  Okay.
[40:55.140 --> 40:55.980]  Most of the time-
[40:55.980 --> 40:56.820]  That's what I'd shoot for.
[40:56.820 --> 40:59.380]  The bottom one, we're going to clean off
[40:59.380 --> 41:01.700]  most of the branching and sucker shoots and shit
[41:01.700 --> 41:02.660]  on the bottom net.
[41:02.660 --> 41:05.580]  That's, we clean all the way.
[41:05.580 --> 41:06.860]  That's I kind of, as a rule of thumb,
[41:06.860 --> 41:07.700]  I kind of clean all the way to the bottom net.
[41:07.700 --> 41:10.100]  The bottom net's only there at the end of flower
[41:10.100 --> 41:13.660]  because it's too hard to get it out before flowering's done.
[41:13.660 --> 41:14.500]  Right.
[41:14.500 --> 41:15.340]  But there shouldn't be buds on that one.
[41:15.340 --> 41:16.300]  Like you're not using it anymore.
[41:16.300 --> 41:18.060]  The bud starts right above that.
[41:18.060 --> 41:20.980]  Like that's, I tell the guys bottom it to the first net.
[41:20.980 --> 41:23.100]  That's kind of the first net goes about 18 inches high
[41:23.100 --> 41:24.140]  and we bottom up to there.
[41:24.140 --> 41:26.300]  So you got however tall the pot is
[41:26.820 --> 41:27.740]  and then the rest of that gets kind of cleaned up.
[41:27.740 --> 41:29.860]  So there's no bud down there.
[41:29.860 --> 41:32.660]  Maybe tiny buds may grow into your net, but that's fine.
[41:32.660 --> 41:33.620]  Just pull them right out.
[41:33.620 --> 41:35.540]  They're going to fall off when you start pulling it.
[41:35.540 --> 41:37.540]  You know, when the guys run through the grow rooms, Mike,
[41:37.540 --> 41:38.380]  and at the end of the day,
[41:38.380 --> 41:39.900]  we got a bunch of little popcorn buds on the floor.
[41:39.900 --> 41:41.420]  Those are the ones that got caught in the net.
[41:41.420 --> 41:42.860]  Those are the little tiny buds that grew
[41:42.860 --> 41:44.420]  on the wrong side of the fence.
[41:44.420 --> 41:46.780]  So your second layer of trellis,
[41:46.780 --> 41:48.580]  that is there to support the buds.
[41:48.580 --> 41:50.200]  So they're going to be leaning against that.
[41:50.200 --> 41:51.260]  They've got to go somewhere.
[41:51.260 --> 41:52.620]  They're toppling over, they're tall.
[41:52.620 --> 41:53.940]  They're going to, and so that is when you get
[41:53.940 --> 41:55.540]  the opportunity for that stick to go straight.
[41:55.540 --> 41:57.460]  The bud starts growing up, the fences around it,
[41:57.460 --> 41:59.700]  and they are going to go on the wrong side of the fence.
[41:59.700 --> 42:00.900]  Yeah, that'll be okay.
[42:00.900 --> 42:01.940]  That will happen.
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.400]  It's going to be hard to prevent.
[42:03.400 --> 42:05.100]  You see where the buds are going to develop
[42:05.100 --> 42:06.540]  because you've got to shoot there,
[42:06.540 --> 42:08.020]  but sometimes you just can't aim it.
[42:08.020 --> 42:09.340]  It's, shit happens.
[42:09.340 --> 42:11.860]  In a tent, you've got a little more chance to control it
[42:11.860 --> 42:13.940]  than you do in a larger facility.
[42:13.940 --> 42:14.780]  Yeah.
[42:14.780 --> 42:16.360]  And when you're talking four or six plants,
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.020]  it's easier to micromanage each cola.
[42:21.120 --> 42:24.720]  It's not possible to do it on a 20 yard table.
[42:24.720 --> 42:25.560]  Yeah.
[42:25.560 --> 42:26.600]  When you cut them down,
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.440]  you're going to cut them down to small buds anyway.
[42:28.440 --> 42:30.440]  Nobody wants, it's really fun to look at
[42:30.440 --> 42:32.440]  big old donkey dick buds, big old bananas,
[42:32.440 --> 42:33.800]  big old dildos of weed,
[42:33.800 --> 42:35.360]  but I don't want to buy those
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.220]  because there's a stick down the middle.
[42:37.220 --> 42:38.420]  There's a drumstick down the middle.
[42:38.420 --> 42:39.960]  I'm not trying to buy a five hay drumstick
[42:39.960 --> 42:40.800]  along with my weed.
[42:40.800 --> 42:42.480]  I'll go to Guitar Center when I need sticks.
[42:42.480 --> 42:44.600]  Actually, I'll visit my friends at Dope Sticks.
[42:44.600 --> 42:46.080]  Shout out to Dope Sticks.
[42:46.080 --> 42:47.420]  You've got to show love to local drummers
[42:47.420 --> 42:48.960]  and people that support you back.
[42:48.960 --> 42:49.800]  That's my friend, Eric Moore.
[42:49.800 --> 42:51.080]  He's got a drum company that makes sticks now.
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.440]  Got to show him love, but I don't want the big bud.
[42:53.440 --> 42:54.400]  You got to cut it down.
[42:55.080 --> 42:55.920]  Make it smaller.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.740]  So in the end of the cycle,
[42:56.740 --> 42:57.920]  you're kind of down making it smaller anyway.
[42:57.920 --> 42:59.480]  Don't be too worried if it's stuck.
[42:59.480 --> 43:01.140]  What you can do at harvest time,
[43:01.140 --> 43:02.800]  you can cut the branch low.
[43:02.800 --> 43:04.720]  And so if your trellis is at one level
[43:04.720 --> 43:06.040]  and the buds grown up through it,
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.720]  cut below there and just slowly slide down
[43:08.720 --> 43:11.600]  and get the trellis net out of there,
[43:11.600 --> 43:13.440]  the string, the plastic line, whatever.
[43:13.440 --> 43:14.620]  Just slowly get it out of there,
[43:14.620 --> 43:16.200]  go downward and pull it out.
[43:16.200 --> 43:18.280]  Hopefully you got like 12 or 14 inches worth of,
[43:18.280 --> 43:19.560]  you won't, I'm just exaggerating
[43:19.560 --> 43:20.800]  and hoping you the best of luck,
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.320]  but it's only going to be a couple of inches.
[43:22.320 --> 43:24.360]  You got to slide down, pull it out of there.
[43:25.200 --> 43:27.000]  Maybe that way you won't break that bud off of the stick
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.080]  and it will still dry and cure properly.
[43:29.080 --> 43:30.560]  But yeah, it's not a big deal.
[43:30.560 --> 43:31.400]  It's not a major issue.
[43:31.400 --> 43:32.640]  It's not a problem.
[43:32.640 --> 43:35.920]  It just makes harvesting as a little bit more challenging
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.160]  once you get it that way.
[43:38.600 --> 43:41.480]  If you can, when it comes harvest time,
[43:41.480 --> 43:43.600]  cut the plants out of the net.
[43:43.600 --> 43:47.720]  Don't cut the net down all at once.
[43:47.720 --> 43:50.360]  Just as a commercial grower with a lot of experience,
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.320]  Mike's nodding his head because he's seen this.
[43:52.320 --> 43:56.160]  So like your net is hooked to some supports
[43:56.160 --> 43:57.960]  on the side of the table.
[43:57.960 --> 43:59.920]  If you cut it free of those supports
[43:59.920 --> 44:04.000]  so that the net flops free all in one piece,
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.640]  it'll fuck up your harvest.
[44:06.640 --> 44:09.320]  All of your buds will flop free all at once.
[44:09.320 --> 44:10.520]  Triple your harvest time.
[44:10.520 --> 44:12.240]  It's easier to cut the buds out of the net
[44:12.240 --> 44:14.880]  than to cut the net out of the buds, to tell you the truth.
[44:14.880 --> 44:17.920]  And it's, yeah, it's super easy to go piecemeal.
[44:19.000 --> 44:19.840]  Be patient.
[44:19.840 --> 44:21.160]  Don't get in a rush.
[44:21.200 --> 44:24.400]  I've seen growers cut other growers.
[44:24.400 --> 44:26.760]  I've seen growers cut themselves.
[44:26.760 --> 44:28.760]  That is when shit goes wrong.
[44:28.760 --> 44:30.880]  I had a guy fall off a ladder once.
[44:30.880 --> 44:32.560]  They were both holding it.
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.840]  And one guy tugged it and one guy fell.
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.040]  If this dude's working in a ladder and is four by four tent,
[44:38.040 --> 44:39.520]  he's already going crazy.
[44:39.520 --> 44:41.240]  So we're gonna drug test him.
[44:41.240 --> 44:42.080]  We're gonna drug test you
[44:42.080 --> 44:44.200]  if I catch you in a ladder in there, buddy.
[44:45.640 --> 44:47.200]  Yeah, that was a really good piece of advice.
[44:47.200 --> 44:49.800]  Bring the net down little by little around the plants.
[44:49.840 --> 44:51.840]  Not all in one piece.
[44:51.840 --> 44:54.360]  Or if you can get the plants out of that top layer,
[44:54.360 --> 44:56.520]  then cut the net out and then take out the bottom layer,
[44:56.520 --> 44:57.440]  then cut the net.
[44:57.440 --> 44:58.760]  You may wanna recycle that net.
[44:58.760 --> 44:59.680]  Bro, it's like eight bucks.
[44:59.680 --> 45:01.760]  Please just fucking get a new one.
[45:01.760 --> 45:03.360]  Yeah, that's something you wanna,
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.520]  that and the reuse and that and the pots.
[45:07.520 --> 45:10.360]  Those are the two most brutal things to reuse.
[45:10.360 --> 45:11.560]  I reuse the pots.
[45:11.560 --> 45:12.960]  I take them to the-
[45:12.960 --> 45:14.080]  The cloth pots.
[45:14.080 --> 45:14.920]  Oh, don't use the,
[45:14.920 --> 45:17.200]  you can run the cloth pots through the washer
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.280]  at the laundry machine.
[45:18.280 --> 45:20.120]  Don't do them at your wife's or your mom's house
[45:20.120 --> 45:21.480]  because she will bitch at you.
[45:21.480 --> 45:22.640]  But do them at the laundry machine
[45:22.640 --> 45:24.000]  at the industrial washing machines.
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.360]  And you can run those cloth pots through there
[45:25.360 --> 45:27.480]  and get one or two uses out of them.
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.480]  They're cheap and affordable,
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.240]  but some of you guys are using the more expensive ones
[45:30.240 --> 45:31.080]  with the zippers.
[45:31.080 --> 45:32.040]  Go wash those.
[45:32.040 --> 45:33.960]  Take your plastic pots to,
[45:33.960 --> 45:36.000]  if you're in a legal state and it's not sketchy,
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.640]  take them to the car wash to spray them down.
[45:38.640 --> 45:39.480]  Yeah.
[45:39.480 --> 45:41.600]  If you can get that thing that holds the floor mats
[45:41.600 --> 45:43.400]  in place on the wall, clip them into that
[45:43.400 --> 45:44.240]  and spray the fuck out of them.
[45:44.240 --> 45:45.600]  Then clip them in and spray them.
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.520]  Yeah, because when you put them on the floor,
[45:46.520 --> 45:47.360]  they're gonna slide away.
[45:47.360 --> 45:48.200]  You can put them up against the wall
[45:48.200 --> 45:49.400]  or put your foot on them or something guys,
[45:49.400 --> 45:50.240]  because they will.
[45:50.240 --> 45:51.080]  That's sprayer.
[45:51.080 --> 45:53.000]  Spray the fuck out of them and don't use any detergent.
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.960]  Just do the hot water rinse.
[45:54.960 --> 45:57.720]  And spray for a couple seconds before you start.
[45:57.720 --> 45:59.560]  So in case there's soap in the line,
[45:59.560 --> 46:01.840]  spray for a few seconds until the water.
[46:01.840 --> 46:02.840]  Yeah, spray the line clear
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.560]  until the water runs hot and clear.
[46:04.560 --> 46:05.400]  Yeah.
[46:05.400 --> 46:07.080]  You don't want car wash in your plants.
[46:07.080 --> 46:09.040]  And if you are in a sketchy area
[46:09.040 --> 46:10.960]  and you need to wash them out at the car wash,
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.800]  put them in the back of the truck face up,
[46:12.800 --> 46:13.760]  like you're gonna load them
[46:13.760 --> 46:14.920]  and then drive up to the car wash
[46:14.920 --> 46:16.520]  and then to stand to the bed of the truck and hose.
[46:16.520 --> 46:18.120]  It looks like you're hosing the bed of your truck down,
[46:18.120 --> 46:19.440]  but you got enough pots in there packed up
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.840]  to where you can just do it in the bed of the truck.
[46:21.840 --> 46:23.320]  Mike, how long have we been at this shit?
[46:23.320 --> 46:25.840]  These are like fucking secret tricks right here.
[46:25.840 --> 46:27.080]  It's like 20 years.
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.680]  I was telling somebody about the old,
[46:29.680 --> 46:33.320]  you can rig an electric car door opener,
[46:33.320 --> 46:34.840]  the little fob openers.
[46:34.840 --> 46:37.320]  You can rig those to block like a bedroom door
[46:37.320 --> 46:39.520]  so that if your landlord comes by unexpectedly,
[46:39.520 --> 46:41.720]  they can't get into that second bedroom.
[46:41.720 --> 46:43.400]  I was telling somebody about that trick last night
[46:43.400 --> 46:44.360]  and they were like, holy fuck,
[46:44.360 --> 46:45.280]  where'd you learn about that?
[46:45.320 --> 46:46.160]  And I was like, oh dude,
[46:46.160 --> 46:48.280]  that was a high times trick when I was in high school.
[46:48.280 --> 46:50.600]  Allegedly, I saw one of the coolest,
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.480]  most stealth grows in a Denver apartment,
[46:53.480 --> 46:55.440]  allegedly, maybe recently.
[46:55.440 --> 46:57.920]  That was fucking, I was impressed.
[46:57.920 --> 47:00.120]  Yeah, I was like, you guys in here?
[47:00.120 --> 47:01.640]  Like I didn't know, I was sitting on the couch
[47:01.640 --> 47:02.960]  on the opposite side of the room
[47:02.960 --> 47:04.040]  and didn't know it existed.
[47:04.040 --> 47:07.560]  So, shout out to my friend who knows what he's doing.
[47:07.560 --> 47:08.520]  We've been going for a while,
[47:08.520 --> 47:10.960]  but we've got one more message from Patreon.
[47:10.960 --> 47:11.800]  One more question.
[47:11.800 --> 47:14.600]  And this person is a Grow From Your Heart podcast supporter.
[47:14.640 --> 47:16.440]  They're an iRegenetics supporter.
[47:16.440 --> 47:18.760]  They support Rasta Jeff and all things I do.
[47:18.760 --> 47:21.640]  They're also members of the DGC.
[47:21.640 --> 47:23.400]  So, a big shout out to this person
[47:23.400 --> 47:26.120]  for being an awesome cannabis soldier,
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.000]  big supporter of the cannabis community.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.120]  Shout out to Rasta K.
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.800]  We've got a message from Patreon from Rasta K.
[47:31.800 --> 47:32.680]  Shout out to Rasta K.
[47:32.680 --> 47:36.080]  Anybody who calls himself Rasta whatever is a friend of mine.
[47:36.080 --> 47:39.360]  It goes like this, I'm waiting for sex on Arise.
[47:40.600 --> 47:41.440]  I don't think I've-
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.280]  How are y'all, brother?
[47:42.280 --> 47:44.560]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever sent a message
[47:45.400 --> 47:47.720]  with the words waiting for sex in the subject.
[47:49.120 --> 47:50.960]  Good luck with your Google searches in the future, bro.
[47:50.960 --> 47:52.360]  How are we, y'all?
[47:52.360 --> 47:54.720]  Anyway, waiting for sex.
[47:54.720 --> 47:55.840]  It says, what up, Grommies?
[47:55.840 --> 47:57.120]  I have a quick question.
[47:57.120 --> 47:59.880]  Though this community, I thought this community could help.
[47:59.880 --> 48:03.600]  I switched over an Arise five days ago to 12-12.
[48:03.600 --> 48:04.800]  So, they've put it into flower.
[48:04.800 --> 48:06.520]  They're 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.200]  It's in the flowering cycle because the question is,
[48:11.200 --> 48:13.960]  is there a specific point, specific, that's the word,
[48:14.400 --> 48:15.240]  specific point, not Pacific.
[48:15.240 --> 48:16.200]  I meant to say specific.
[48:16.200 --> 48:19.760]  Is there a specific point that would show sex first?
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.000]  I did top it.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.360]  So, would the pistols or sacks show up higher
[48:23.360 --> 48:25.160]  on the plant or lower?
[48:25.160 --> 48:26.840]  Or is this all random?
[48:26.840 --> 48:28.520]  Thanks, guys.
[48:29.600 --> 48:32.000]  How long ago did you top it before you put it into flower?
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.760]  I'm hoping you gave it seven, 10, maybe 14 days to recover
[48:35.760 --> 48:38.120]  so that the auxins and cytokinins can run back
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.120]  to the tips of the plant and try to fight
[48:41.120 --> 48:42.800]  over apical dominance.
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.000]  I hope you did that.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.520]  Too late to fucking worry about it at this point.
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.400]  Not gonna make too big of a difference.
[48:48.400 --> 48:49.600]  Would have gotten bigger, fatter buds
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.760]  had you let it recover.
[48:52.760 --> 48:55.240]  At first, I thought they were asking what timeframe
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.440]  it will show sex.
[48:56.440 --> 48:57.720]  And I was going to say 10 to 14 days.
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.320]  Higher location.
[48:59.320 --> 49:00.880]  At what, yeah, location.
[49:00.880 --> 49:04.160]  What specific point on the plant will it show sex?
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.200]  Look at the very tops.
[49:05.200 --> 49:09.080]  I think the tops are going to be the most indicative points
[49:09.080 --> 49:11.360]  of the plant to find sex.
[49:11.360 --> 49:13.640]  So you'll start seeing, if it's a female,
[49:13.640 --> 49:15.680]  you'll start getting the little pistils coming out.
[49:15.680 --> 49:17.840]  If it's a male, you'll start seeing little nubs.
[49:17.840 --> 49:20.480]  And eventually those nubs will turn into little ball sacks.
[49:20.480 --> 49:24.360]  So the top is probably the best place to look.
[49:24.360 --> 49:27.000]  Or if you've got an area that's getting really shaded,
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.600]  that area may develop into flower more quickly.
[49:29.600 --> 49:32.200]  Sometimes the male plants will show you a little lower down.
[49:32.200 --> 49:34.200]  They'll start popping off just one or two sacks
[49:34.200 --> 49:35.240]  that are really extended
[49:35.240 --> 49:37.080]  because they're trying to reach for the light.
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.000]  But typically the tops are going to be
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.880]  where you're going to see sex first
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.120]  because the male plants grow taller.
[49:45.120 --> 49:45.960]  Here's a weird thing.
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.400]  In my opinion, what I've experienced,
[49:47.400 --> 49:49.160]  the male plants generally grow taller
[49:49.160 --> 49:50.440]  than all of the females.
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.120]  They'll get taller.
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.000]  So if you've got a batch of the same strain,
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.920]  a batch of whatever seeds, golden goat seeds,
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.440]  that's not a good fucking selection
[49:58.440 --> 49:59.680]  because that's a feminized.
[49:59.680 --> 50:01.200]  We need a blue raspberry truffle.
[50:01.200 --> 50:02.320]  We got blue raspberry truffle.
[50:02.320 --> 50:06.120]  The males typically grow just a ratio taller.
[50:06.120 --> 50:07.440]  I don't know what size pots you're using,
[50:07.440 --> 50:08.840]  but it's going to be noticeably taller
[50:08.840 --> 50:10.400]  because they're going to make pollen
[50:10.400 --> 50:13.040]  and that pollen needs to fall down onto the females.
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.600]  So the tops are usually where we start getting the,
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.240]  that's where they want to put their pollination parts.
[50:18.240 --> 50:19.800]  Their sex glands go up to the top
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.000]  so they can catch that pollen.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.600]  If it was down lower, it would get intercepted by leaves.
[50:23.600 --> 50:25.880]  It'd get blown away by the wind by the time it got to it.
[50:25.880 --> 50:28.680]  So the tips, that's where their vaginas are.
[50:28.680 --> 50:30.520]  The vaginas are on the tips mainly.
[50:30.520 --> 50:31.480]  It's where they start off first.
[50:31.480 --> 50:33.640]  So it wants to get pollinated up there.
[50:33.640 --> 50:35.680]  So that's something to think about.
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.400]  If you guys are checking for males and females,
[50:37.400 --> 50:39.720]  quite often, not a hundred percent true.
[50:39.720 --> 50:41.000]  Sometimes it's phenotypical.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.680]  Sometimes you get some mutants and some freaks
[50:42.680 --> 50:45.520]  and some champions, but usually if you run a pack of seeds,
[50:45.520 --> 50:47.440]  those plants, they get super tall right away
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.200]  or generally going to be boys.
[50:49.200 --> 50:50.040]  Don't get too excited.
[50:50.040 --> 50:51.120]  That was the urban legend.
[50:51.120 --> 50:53.480]  And the more we ran, I thought that was funny
[50:53.480 --> 50:54.760]  that that one held true.
[50:54.760 --> 50:57.440]  Yeah. I kind of believed it from the beginning
[50:57.440 --> 50:58.920]  because it's got a reason.
[50:58.920 --> 51:00.560]  There's like a reason in nature.
[51:00.560 --> 51:01.880]  It makes a lot of sense.
[51:01.880 --> 51:04.920]  It's, if that's not actually true,
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.720]  that sounds true as fuck.
[51:08.080 --> 51:10.320]  It's true in my experience for sure.
[51:10.320 --> 51:12.720]  Well, the boys want to get up there and drop pollen down.
[51:12.720 --> 51:15.680]  If the boys are lower, you can't pollinate the top bud.
[51:15.680 --> 51:18.440]  And do the short guys ever get to fuck the tall chick?
[51:20.360 --> 51:22.240]  The first couple of times I popped seeds,
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.320]  I got really excited over the super vigorous one.
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.160]  Yes.
[51:27.160 --> 51:29.000]  And each time it was like, oh man,
[51:30.320 --> 51:33.000]  one, 10 days into flowering, you come in and it's like,
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.880]  oh man, that plant's got a heart on.
[51:34.880 --> 51:36.040]  I tell a lot of people,
[51:36.080 --> 51:38.480]  like that one you're excited about, it's going to be a boy.
[51:38.480 --> 51:39.320]  And they're like, don't say that.
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.440]  And I'm like, no, I already, it's not,
[51:40.440 --> 51:41.280]  I'm not jinxing you.
[51:41.280 --> 51:42.320]  It's a fucking dude.
[51:42.320 --> 51:43.920]  That's why it's a foot taller than the rest.
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.280]  It's why it's more vigorous.
[51:45.280 --> 51:46.120]  Yeah.
[51:46.120 --> 51:46.960]  It's like I'm not fucking with you.
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.040]  That's Adam's apple.
[51:48.040 --> 51:49.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[51:49.560 --> 51:51.360]  Yeah. I'm going to move on from that.
[51:51.360 --> 51:52.200]  It's 2020.
[51:53.600 --> 51:54.880]  Mike, this was a fun podcast.
[51:54.880 --> 51:57.400]  We've been going for like, I think close to an hour, dude.
[51:57.400 --> 51:59.200]  I wrote it down on another page of notes
[51:59.200 --> 52:00.680]  and I don't know where it went.
[52:00.680 --> 52:02.040]  Yeah, dude, we've been going for close to an hour.
[52:02.040 --> 52:04.960]  So yeah, let's start wrapping up this show, bro.
[52:04.960 --> 52:06.160]  I had a good time with you.
[52:06.160 --> 52:07.000]  Yeah.
[52:07.000 --> 52:07.840]  The people deserve this.
[52:07.840 --> 52:10.720]  I think the last episode, I was off my game, dude.
[52:10.720 --> 52:11.680]  I watched it again and I was like,
[52:11.680 --> 52:13.040]  it's not as bad as I felt like it was,
[52:13.040 --> 52:15.440]  but I was just a little bit off my crackers.
[52:15.440 --> 52:18.360]  We might want to look at the last episode re-recorded.
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.080]  We talked about being a little,
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.200]  a little recorded ahead in this episode.
[52:23.200 --> 52:25.080]  So I don't feel like we're giving away
[52:25.080 --> 52:27.200]  any movie magic secrets,
[52:27.200 --> 52:30.760]  but we were in rare form for an episode, folks.
[52:30.760 --> 52:33.480]  If you enjoyed it, thumbs up.
[52:33.520 --> 52:34.800]  If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[52:34.800 --> 52:36.000]  it might've got edited.
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.520]  There wasn't much editing to be done,
[52:38.520 --> 52:41.080]  but we were, I think we may have had too many dabs
[52:41.080 --> 52:43.080]  for a podcast that night, dude.
[52:43.080 --> 52:46.120]  Might've, we got, we got carried away
[52:46.120 --> 52:47.440]  before the show a little bit.
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.080]  And it was also like two in the morning.
[52:49.080 --> 52:51.880]  So that should always has an effect on us.
[52:51.880 --> 52:52.960]  It does.
[52:52.960 --> 52:54.120]  Yeah.
[52:54.120 --> 52:55.720]  Late night podcasting from the bunker.
[52:55.720 --> 52:56.960]  It's been a good time, dude.
[52:56.960 --> 52:59.480]  The late night bunker sessions, man.
[52:59.480 --> 53:00.320]  So-
[53:00.320 --> 53:01.160]  Brought to you by Zoom.
[53:01.160 --> 53:02.000]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[53:02.000 --> 53:02.840]  They didn't pay us shit.
[53:03.160 --> 53:04.400]  I paid them, so fuck that.
[53:05.520 --> 53:07.080]  Made possible by Zoom.
[53:07.080 --> 53:07.920]  Yeah, brought to you by seedshere.com.

[53:10.280 --> 53:12.720]  Thanks to everybody on Patreon who helps us out.
[53:12.720 --> 53:14.440]  Mike, I've never given you the warning
[53:14.440 --> 53:15.280]  that I'm going to do this,
[53:15.280 --> 53:16.360]  but I think you should expect it right now.
[53:16.360 --> 53:19.360]  Do you have any Mike's moments here at the end of the show?
[53:19.360 --> 53:20.360]  A Mike's moment?
[53:20.360 --> 53:22.320]  No, just be good to each other, people.
[53:22.320 --> 53:24.080]  All right, sounds good to me.
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.440]  Where can the kind folks find you on social media?
[53:27.440 --> 53:31.720]  Find me at, at NemoPunk15 on Twitter or Instagram
[53:31.760 --> 53:35.680]  and at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.

[53:39.480 --> 53:41.000]  forward slash white Mike.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  Beautifully done, bro.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.080]  You're doing that like a podcasting professional
[53:44.080 --> 53:44.920]  at this point.
[53:44.920 --> 53:47.160]  Like a pro, like I was expecting you to do that shit.
[53:47.160 --> 53:49.400]  Yeah, thanks again for hanging out, dude.
[53:49.400 --> 53:50.600]  Hell yeah, thanks for having me.
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.440]  It was great.
[53:51.440 --> 53:52.280]  You had something to say, go for it.
[53:52.280 --> 53:53.120]  Don't let me interrupt you.
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.800]  I was going to say, keep leaving YouTube comments,
[53:54.800 --> 53:58.520]  keep sending emails, keep sending tweets.
[53:58.520 --> 54:01.320]  Love the interactions and want more, so.
[54:01.920 --> 54:03.640]  Yeah, we want more, just like you want more.
[54:03.640 --> 54:04.800]  We want more interaction.
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.760]  We'll keep putting out shows, you keep responding.
[54:06.760 --> 54:09.040]  We'll keep interacting, keeping them coming for you.
[54:09.040 --> 54:10.240]  Be safe while you're in quarantine
[54:10.240 --> 54:11.800]  or while you're doing whatever you're doing.
[54:11.800 --> 54:14.240]  I feel like pretty soon, man, we may get to go play again
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.040]  and see some comedy shows and high five people.
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.080]  I'm itching, there's a couple of possible events coming.
[54:21.080 --> 54:22.640]  Well, they're just itching to get out again.
[54:22.640 --> 54:25.200]  Like I'm, it's weird, cause I'm a shut in anyway.
[54:26.280 --> 54:28.600]  But I've kind of reached the end of my limit.
[54:28.640 --> 54:31.920]  I need to get out and see some people and do some things.
[54:31.920 --> 54:33.800]  I freaking agree.
[54:33.800 --> 54:34.640]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[54:34.640 --> 54:35.560]  I'm just a system.
[54:35.560 --> 54:36.560]  Yes, yes.
[54:37.520 --> 54:39.120]  Take care of yourselves, behave yourselves.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.840]  I'm not going to talk any conspiracies.
[54:40.840 --> 54:42.120]  You're an adult, do what you want to do.
[54:42.120 --> 54:43.320]  I love you for it.
