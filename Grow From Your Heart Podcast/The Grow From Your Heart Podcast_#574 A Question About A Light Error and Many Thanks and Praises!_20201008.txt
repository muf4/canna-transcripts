[01:01.390 --> 01:07.630]  what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Fatso OG No. 1 Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:07.630 --> 01:13.590]  This is a blend of GMO and Legend OG. On the package, the flavor is described as dark roast,
[01:13.590 --> 01:18.790]  garlic, and fuel. I completely agree with that. I completely love that flavor description.
[01:18.790 --> 01:23.270]  I love that type of flavor and aroma on my tongue. It makes my taste buds happy, and
[01:23.270 --> 01:27.790]  I really love the nice buzz. It's kind of a heavy buzz. It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[01:27.790 --> 01:32.510]  It's got me chilled out in my chair, really digging the buzz from the Fatso OG. On the
[01:32.510 --> 01:39.630]  back of the package, it says it contains 82.68% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. Big
[01:39.630 --> 01:45.550]  shout-out to Fatso for making perfect podcast concentrate. All right. In this episode, I'm
[01:45.550 --> 01:49.710]  going to read a few messages from Patreon. Before we get there, let's do some shout-outs
[01:49.710 --> 01:54.030]  to a few of the folks who support the show on Patreon. Let's start off with a big Grow

[03:04.350 --> 03:08.310]  All right, where are we going next? We're going to talk about these fancy shirts. The
[03:08.310 --> 03:13.090]  last time we spoke I had a couple of shirts available. There are now at the time of this
[03:13.090 --> 03:17.230]  episode is being recorded. There are three shirts available on my Etsy store. If you
[03:17.230 --> 03:22.710]  go to I've actually if you visit I read genetics.com and click on the store tab that will take
[03:22.710 --> 03:27.510]  you directly to my Etsy store that website is under construction but the store tab is
[03:27.510 --> 03:33.330]  functioning. It is I read genetics.com click on the store tab or simply go to Etsy search
[03:33.330 --> 03:38.470]  for I read gifts LLC that will get you there. I'm about to show you the fancy shirts. Last
[03:38.470 --> 03:41.930]  time I think I showed you let's recap what we showed last time and build suspense. That's
[03:41.930 --> 03:46.030]  always fun. If you're watching on the video show on YouTube like I encourage you get to
[03:46.030 --> 03:51.150]  see the lemon Jeffrey t-shirts. What I'm holding up now is a small that is a small
[03:51.150 --> 03:55.070]  shirt just so you know what size I'm playing with that is the lemon Jeffrey shirt. The
[03:55.070 --> 04:00.230]  next one I'm going to show the camera will be the orange gasm shirt. Once again, I'm
[04:00.230 --> 04:04.990]  showing the camera a small just in case you're judging what size maybe you should buy. That
[04:04.990 --> 04:10.690]  is a small orange gasm shirt. It's got the orange gasm logo says I read genetics on it.
[04:10.690 --> 04:15.510]  All of these shirts are they do have the words I read genetics on them. So it's got my brand
[04:15.510 --> 04:19.110]  listed on there, but they are not blatantly cannabis. They don't have weed leaves or anything
[04:19.110 --> 04:23.750]  like that. They do have the orange for orange gasm and the lemon for lemon Jeffrey on there.
[04:23.750 --> 04:26.310]  One of my buttons on my shirt popped open as I was showing you that we're getting a
[04:26.310 --> 04:31.710]  little a little risque here. But anyway, it's got the logo on there. This one may be my
[04:31.710 --> 04:35.310]  favorite. I thought the lemon Jeffrey would be my favorite. I thought the orange gasm
[04:35.310 --> 04:38.950]  would be my favorite. They all battled for favorites. But the look on this little goats
[04:38.950 --> 04:44.350]  face this golden goat shirt. I'm loving the look on the goats face. He just looks nice
[04:44.350 --> 04:50.910]  and stone. So stone goat. That is the golden goat shirt. Once again, the shirt that I showed
[04:50.910 --> 04:54.830]  the camera was a small so if you guys are looking for the shirts once again, they are
[04:54.830 --> 04:59.390]  on I read genetics.com click on the store tab. I do apologize. The website is under
[04:59.390 --> 05:03.910]  construction. Give me three or four weeks and that website will impress you. Big shout
[05:03.910 --> 05:08.110]  out to my friend who was working on it. We've had a couple of meetings. Both of us are doing
[05:08.110 --> 05:12.010]  late night meetings trying to get this website going. We're both stone and half asleep trying
[05:12.010 --> 05:16.490]  to communicate on a website. We're getting it going. Be patient with us. Anyhow, I read
[05:16.490 --> 05:21.970]  genetics.com click on the store tab that will get you to the store or simply visit Etsy.com
[05:21.970 --> 05:28.130]  search for I re gifts LLC. You'll see the shirts. Grab one get styled out then send
[05:28.130 --> 05:31.810]  me a picture of yourself in the shirt when I send it to you. I want to see what you look
[05:31.810 --> 05:35.730]  like and give me permission to share it or tell me do or do not share this. I'll post
[05:35.730 --> 05:39.330]  it up to social media. You'll get some followers and I'll get to share what the shirts look
[05:39.330 --> 05:42.830]  like on people. All right, let's move forward. Ladies and gentlemen, where are we going
[05:42.830 --> 05:47.570]  to go from here? Like Axel Rose said, where do we go now? I think this is the part of
[05:47.570 --> 05:52.510]  the show where we jump into reading Patreon messages. I've got a great big stack of emails
[05:52.510 --> 05:57.310]  and messages here in front of me. Let's not waste too much more time with my stone rambles.
[05:57.310 --> 06:01.170]  And let's get right into it. The first couple are going to be from Patreon. They're going
[06:01.170 --> 06:05.690]  to be mainly compliments and praise. Then we're going to move into some grow questions.
[06:05.690 --> 06:13.770]  This one comes from Smokey J. And it goes just like this. I just got my mail from seedsherenow.com.
[06:13.770 --> 06:19.090]  That was the easiest purchase I have ever made. I just got some shredder, Raphael and
[06:19.090 --> 06:23.490]  Sunkiss from you. That is a nice lineup, dude. You got the shredder for that like lemony
[06:23.490 --> 06:28.050]  and funky turps, Raphael for that strawberry stuff and Sunkiss for the orange turps. You
[06:28.050 --> 06:32.150]  are going to be a happy camper in a few weeks here. It goes on to say, I'm very excited
[06:32.150 --> 06:37.190]  to get them started. Also, the five pack of Sunkiss actually had seven seeds in there.
[06:37.190 --> 06:40.970]  You guys, I didn't make this message up. This came from an actual Patreon subscriber who
[06:40.970 --> 06:45.590]  bought seeds and was extremely happy with their experience. They found seven seeds in
[06:45.590 --> 06:49.650]  their five pack. I'm not going to say you're going to find five in yours, but sometimes
[06:49.650 --> 06:53.330]  that happens. If I'm in a good mood and we're packing up seeds, and I know that I'm going
[06:53.330 --> 06:57.630]  to have enough seeds to fill the amount of packages I made, I may just go put extra seeds
[06:57.630 --> 07:01.310]  in there just to make sure you're happy. I know you guys work really hard for your
[07:01.310 --> 07:06.150]  money. Money's expensive. Time is expensive. The whole time you're at work, you're away
[07:06.150 --> 07:10.830]  from whatever it is that makes you happy. Most of us aren't as blessed as myself. I
[07:10.830 --> 07:15.030]  love my job. I've built a career for myself. I love this. Most of us aren't that blessed.
[07:15.030 --> 07:18.510]  You got to go somewhere and listen to some asshole tell you what to do all day. You don't
[07:18.510 --> 07:22.190]  want to do that all day. You got to be away from your Xbox. You got to be away from your
[07:22.190 --> 07:24.990]  loved ones. You got to be away from your puppy. You got to be away from Pornhub, whatever
[07:24.990 --> 07:27.870]  it is that's got your attention. You can't fucking do that because you're working for
[07:27.870 --> 07:32.590]  some asshole all day just for enough money to barely get by. Then you got to work a few
[07:32.590 --> 07:36.830]  weeks and save up a few weeks so you could buy some seeds. I understand. I get it. I
[07:36.830 --> 07:40.670]  want you to be happy. I want you to set yourselves up for success when you get the seeds. I do
[07:40.670 --> 07:45.310]  what I can to make sure you are successful. If you get seven in a pack, that's almost
[07:45.310 --> 07:50.590]  like 30%. That's almost 50% extra for free. I'm not good at math that quickly, but I know
[07:50.590 --> 07:53.870]  that money's expensive. I know that being away from home to make money sucks. You want
[07:53.870 --> 07:57.470]  to be with your family, your puppy, your plants, your fucking Xbox, whatever else you
[07:57.470 --> 08:00.910]  got at home going on. You want to be there. Maybe you just want to be on the road doing
[08:00.910 --> 08:04.190]  something else. I want to be at a fish show having a good time. Maybe you want to be seeing
[08:04.190 --> 08:08.350]  whatever band you want to see. Either way, money is expensive. I appreciate that you
[08:08.350 --> 08:12.990]  trust me and spend your money on my brand with me. That means a lot to me. I make sure
[08:12.990 --> 08:17.030]  to make sure that you are happy. It's a good symbiosis. You guys are going to stay happy.
[08:17.030 --> 08:21.630]  You keep me happy. Thank you. You found seven seeds in there. You're very welcome. Make
[08:21.630 --> 08:25.070]  me proud when you grow those. I want to see pictures. If you've got a friend who is in
[08:25.070 --> 08:28.630]  need that wants to grow that has never grown before, that's got some space, maybe you could
[08:28.630 --> 08:32.630]  be a nice guy and pass on those extra two beans. Get your friend growing. See if they
[08:32.630 --> 08:37.110]  find a winner also. We're going to keep going. It says, you're an inspiration to me to better
[08:37.110 --> 08:43.510]  my grow and better myself. Thanks again so much from Smokey J. Smokey J, thank you. This
[08:43.510 --> 08:48.710]  is a two-way relationship. If I just did podcasts and made seeds that weren't quality and nobody
[08:48.710 --> 08:53.510]  enjoyed it, nobody appreciated it, I would probably be in a mental hospital. If I set
[08:53.510 --> 08:57.590]  this gear up twice a week and just did this and nobody cared, that would be a sign of
[08:57.590 --> 09:02.950]  psycho or psychotic or some weirdness. I would need medication and a padded room. It's a
[09:02.950 --> 09:06.930]  two-way street. Thank you, man. Also, the seed business is the same. If I was just making
[09:06.930 --> 09:10.830]  seeds and selling them and nobody purchased them, nobody cared about them, I'd be hungry.
[09:10.830 --> 09:15.470]  Thank you. I do appreciate your trust and your faith in me and my brand. Thank you,
[09:15.470 --> 09:19.510]  I appreciate that. I'm fucking rambly. I love it when I get talkative like this because it
[09:19.510 --> 09:25.870]  makes good podcasts, but I've got to keep moving. Big shout out to Smokey J and thank you for the
[09:25.870 --> 09:31.350]  Patreon support. This one comes from, do they want their name said? Yes, it says right in the
[09:31.350 --> 09:37.230]  beginning. It says, hey, Rasta Jeff. Somebody needs to write that song. Hey, Rasta Jeff. It'll
[09:37.230 --> 09:41.550]  get going. My name is Brad. Good to meet you, Brad. I'm Rasta Jeff. It says, I've been listening
[09:41.750 --> 09:47.550]  every week for about two years now and I'm almost mostly caught up with your back catalog too. Man,
[09:47.550 --> 09:54.470]  that's 573 episodes you've listened to. I would be sick of my own voice by now. Thank you. I hope
[09:54.470 --> 09:57.310]  you've learned a lot and I'm sure you've got some questions by now. I hope you've heard the
[09:57.310 --> 10:02.150]  progression of the show. This show has changed, evolved, morphed, rotated a lot. I used to do
[10:02.150 --> 10:07.190]  segments and shit at the beginning. I used to type out almost everything I was going to say
[10:07.190 --> 10:11.670]  throughout the entire show would be written. I would sit here and read a script. This is how I
[10:11.670 --> 10:16.070]  recommend you transplant plants. First, you want to place your hand on top of the soil and gently
[10:16.070 --> 10:21.510]  grip the stem. Then turn the pot upside down and shake it gently until the pot comes out. I was
[10:21.510 --> 10:26.870]  fucking, I was robotic. It wasn't as much fun. I took a while to get comfortable doing this. Look
[10:26.870 --> 10:31.350]  at me now. I got like four notes and I just ramble. This is a lot of fun now. Thank you for
[10:31.710 --> 10:35.310]  watching my journey. All of you, thank you for watching the evolution, the journey, the
[10:35.310 --> 10:40.670]  progression of the podcast. If you listened to through the episodes when I had my head injury, I
[10:40.670 --> 10:46.710]  apologize and thank you. There were some episodes you guys in about 2015 around April, I think it
[10:46.710 --> 10:53.150]  was, I hit my head. Some of the episodes are fucking goofy. I tried to keep going. I wasn't
[10:53.150 --> 10:57.030]  all there and people were emailing me saying, hey, what the fuck are you saying on this episode,
[10:57.030 --> 11:01.070]  bro? I was like, I don't even know. I really couldn't tell you either. Thank you guys for being
[11:01.070 --> 11:05.230]  patient with me and dealing with me through that. Let's get me back on track. This guy's been
[11:05.230 --> 11:09.270]  listening for two years, caught up on the back catalog. Keep up the good work. The shows keep
[11:09.270 --> 11:14.310]  getting better. So you were paying attention. Thank you. I'm getting better at speaking, getting
[11:14.310 --> 11:19.270]  better at podcasting, more comfortable with this microphone. And also I'm becoming a better grower.
[11:19.270 --> 11:24.350]  I'm experienced and exposed to more shit. Every time I go to a grow to a facility, I still troll
[11:24.350 --> 11:28.150]  the internet like I used to to read what's going on and grows. I'm still watching all the hot
[11:28.150 --> 11:32.230]  breeders trying to better myself every day. If I stop, then you guys will beat me and you'll be way
[11:32.230 --> 11:36.390]  ahead of me and there'll be no reason for me to have a show. So I got to stay training too, or the
[11:36.390 --> 11:41.550]  sensei will get passed up by the student. It says I've been a Patreon contributor for a year now,
[11:41.550 --> 11:47.230]  but I want to step it up to the 710 club. Thank you. I appreciate that. Don't anybody out there
[11:47.230 --> 11:50.950]  don't feel like you have to contribute or you have to step up your contributions. That is a
[11:50.950 --> 11:56.190]  voluntary thing that I love and appreciate. If you can't do it, somebody out there will cover it for
[11:56.190 --> 11:59.990]  you. Our friend Brad here just covered a couple of people for the month. You guys get to listen and
[11:59.990 --> 12:04.790]  enjoy it. If you can't afford or support the Patreon, just tell a friend to listen to the show.
[12:05.070 --> 12:09.510]  Anyway, Brad, thank you for catching up on all the episodes. That is a lot of clicks. Wherever you're
[12:09.510 --> 12:14.630]  listening. You've increased my listens by 500. If you're listening on Stitcher, Apple podcasts or
[12:14.630 --> 12:19.590]  YouTube, I got 500 clicks out of you and that really moves the show along, makes it more available
[12:19.590 --> 12:23.590]  on algorithms. So that's awesome. Thank you. And thank you for the support. And thank you for
[12:23.590 --> 12:29.030]  mentioning that the show keeps getting better. Brad did write a quite lengthy email. We're not
[12:29.030 --> 12:33.870]  going to read it all here on the episode. But it says the last two guys coughing was a great show. I
[12:33.870 --> 12:38.910]  always enjoy when white Mike comes on. And you guys talk about the industry and history. You hear
[12:38.910 --> 12:44.110]  that Mike, they enjoy our rambles. So we need you to come back soon. You don't have to come back just
[12:44.110 --> 12:49.030]  to do the legalization part to come hang out again, Mike, you're always invited. This guy loves your
[12:49.030 --> 12:55.030]  company. Then it says your recent episode on making fem seeds was also very interesting. I like it
[12:55.030 --> 12:59.550]  when you get into some more of the more unique topics. I'm glad you're paying attention. Thank you.
[12:59.550 --> 13:03.950]  I don't know if some of those in depth lessons lose people or if you guys care or not. So I love
[13:03.950 --> 13:10.310]  feedback. Thank you. Also goes on to say I also enjoy the shows when Jesse is on. I'm sure he's
[13:10.310 --> 13:15.310]  getting into crunch time with his grows this time of year. There's a lot more of this message, but I
[13:15.310 --> 13:20.870]  wanted to cover the first crucial and important topics. A couple of compliments and invitations
[13:20.870 --> 13:26.230]  for my friends to come back. Yes, Jesse is a busy man. I'm not even sure where Jesse is right now.
[13:26.230 --> 13:31.350]  Jesse could be in Mexico. Jesse could be in Oklahoma. He could be in Colorado. He could be down
[13:31.350 --> 13:37.590]  the street from me. I'm not sure where the dude is. He moves around a lot. Shout out to Jesse. I like
[13:37.590 --> 13:41.750]  what I've got. But sometimes Jesse, I'm fucking jealous of your lifestyle, bro. You're like, I'm
[13:41.750 --> 13:44.870]  like, what are you doing tomorrow? I'm flying to Tulsa. And I'm like, Oh, we'll come over the next
[13:44.870 --> 13:49.350]  day. You're like, Oh, I'm going to Mexico for three days after that. And then I'll be back. And I'm
[13:49.350 --> 13:54.150]  like, What are you even doing, bro? But I love it. I love it. That carefree floaty lifestyle is fucking
[13:54.150 --> 13:58.950]  awesome. But Mike and Jesse, this isn't an official formal invitation. This listener wants you guys
[13:58.950 --> 14:03.230]  back on the show. So come on the show, gentlemen, whether it's here in person, whether it's zoom, you
[14:03.230 --> 14:08.270]  guys are invited. I want you on the show. All right. Brad, I want to thank you for the long message.
[14:08.470 --> 14:13.750]  It wraps up with anyway, thanks for reading. Anyway, thanks for reading my long message. I don't know
[14:13.750 --> 14:18.270]  what my mouth said, but my brain didn't make it right there. Anyway, thanks for reading my long
[14:18.270 --> 14:22.910]  message. Not really any questions here. But if you choose to read this on one of your feedback shows,
[14:23.070 --> 14:27.550]  there you go. What do you got in the feedback portion of this show? You can use Brad. That is
[14:27.550 --> 14:32.390]  also fine for the 710. Shout out big shout out to our new friend, Brad, for supporting the show at
[14:32.390 --> 14:38.070]  the 710 level or higher. Then it says I hope I can meet you at an event someday when this is all over.
[14:38.150 --> 14:44.070]  Have a great podcast from Brad. Hey, Brad, thank you. I hope that when this is over, we do get to
[14:44.070 --> 14:48.870]  meet at the dude grows cup, or maybe at a one of the events. I'm not even gonna start listing them
[14:48.870 --> 14:52.950]  because I'm just gonna get heartbroken that none of them are happening. Oh, Brad, thank you for the
[14:52.950 --> 14:56.950]  great message, bro. We're gonna keep moving forward. I've got another message. This one is all
[14:56.950 --> 15:02.390]  thanks and praise for the podcast. This comes from Jay Tapa. And it says your grow lessons deserve my
[15:02.390 --> 15:08.270]  patronage. I get more impressed with you every day. Rasta Jeff. Thank you. That means a lot to me. I
[15:08.270 --> 15:13.110]  don't know that I'm aiming to impress. I like that I do impress that feels fucking good. It wasn't my
[15:13.110 --> 15:17.350]  goal. I'm coming out here to give you a quality podcast and improve your grow. So I'm glad that
[15:17.350 --> 15:23.350]  you're impressed and thank you for the patronage. My grow lessons earned that patronage. Thank you
[15:23.350 --> 15:27.110]  very much. If you ever have any questions or anything like that, please feel free to reach out
[15:27.110 --> 15:32.630]  and ask your questions. Big shout out to our friend Jay Tapa. All right, we've got one more.
[15:33.510 --> 15:36.230]  Excuse me, I hope you didn't hear that come through the microphone. We're gonna take a drink and make
[15:36.230 --> 15:41.030]  sure that doesn't happen again. Thanks for hanging out you guys. This is a fun episode. It's going
[15:41.030 --> 15:45.510]  really well for me. I feel like I was going way too fast in the last podcast episode. I don't know
[15:45.510 --> 15:49.990]  what whatever I smoked before the show just made my brain spin. I couldn't keep up with my own brain.
[15:49.990 --> 15:54.070]  So thank you for all the compliments on the last episode. I feel like this one's going much more
[15:54.070 --> 16:01.020]  smoothly from for me. Get a little hydration going on and we will continue with the show.
[16:01.580 --> 16:04.300]  I'm not even gonna edit this part out. It's like you're hanging out with me. Thank you for being
[16:04.300 --> 16:10.220]  here. Also, thank you for all the compliments on the new studio space slash office space. I took
[16:10.220 --> 16:15.500]  your advice. I put a light in front of me. I can already tell a difference on the camera. There are
[16:15.500 --> 16:19.180]  new toys coming in the works. I need some time to go shopping. I want to look at some new gear. I'm
[16:19.180 --> 16:23.260]  gonna buy some new shit and do some cool stuff for you guys. I appreciate you watching. I appreciate
[16:23.260 --> 16:27.740]  how many people have been joining on and following the videos following the audio show. I owe it to
[16:27.740 --> 16:31.900]  you to kind of upgrade the show a little bit. All the Patreon contributions will make that easy.
[16:31.900 --> 16:35.820]  There will be a new camera coming. There will be some lighting coming. I may get a new microphone.
[16:35.820 --> 16:40.220]  This one sounds good, right? I've been looking at the SM7B. I'd love to have it. It looks nice
[16:40.220 --> 16:45.820]  and professional, but this thing does it, bro. I sound pretty good, I think. Anyway, I should quit
[16:45.820 --> 16:49.260]  rambling and focus on this or again, we're gonna have a real long episode and that thing I just
[16:49.260 --> 16:53.420]  said about doing a great show is not gonna count anymore. Let's keep moving you guys. This one comes
[16:53.420 --> 16:57.500]  from our good friend Tonto's Garden. What up, Tonto? Always good to hear from you, big brother.
[16:57.500 --> 17:02.140]  This message goes like this. Hey, let me move it this way so I can look toward the camera a little
[17:02.140 --> 17:06.940]  bit. I'm currently taking in as much information as my brain will handle on breathing right now.
[17:06.940 --> 17:13.020]  I just finished episode 331 and had someone email on how you and cannabis has impacted them. Yes,
[17:13.020 --> 17:18.140]  in some episodes people message me and let me know how cannabis has impacted their lives.
[17:18.140 --> 17:23.580]  It said, I hadn't done so in a while, so I thought I would. I love this type of feedback from my
[17:23.580 --> 17:30.380]  listeners. It goes on to say, I'm a proud veteran of Princess, Patricia's, Canadian Light Infantry
[17:30.380 --> 17:38.620]  or PPCLI for short, who sustained both physical and mental injuries during my service. My condition
[17:38.620 --> 17:44.700]  affected me in my everyday life in one way or another, which cannabis has helped with immensely.
[17:44.700 --> 17:50.620]  I will start by thanking you for putting all that information, effort, and your own time, plus guests
[17:50.620 --> 17:56.060]  on the internet for free of charge. There is so much to unpack here. First of all, thank you for
[17:56.060 --> 18:01.180]  your service. I'm not in Canada, but still, you're a soldier. You put yourself out there and you've
[18:01.180 --> 18:06.540]  been injured mentally and physically, maybe not fighting for my country, but for your country.
[18:06.540 --> 18:12.220]  That is commendable and respectable. You can tell by looking at me, I'm not soldier material.
[18:12.220 --> 18:16.460]  I would probably bitch out and cry. To be quite honest with you, they start shooting at me,
[18:16.460 --> 18:21.340]  I'm going to duck and cry and hope you've got my back. Thank you for having people's backs.
[18:21.340 --> 18:27.340]  That is not meant for me. I'm not for war. I'm not for battle. There doesn't need to be any
[18:27.340 --> 18:31.020]  bloodshed and killing and shit. We should all fucking smoke some dabs and have a good time.
[18:31.020 --> 18:35.900]  I understand the world doesn't fucking work like that. Unfortunately, there needs to be
[18:35.900 --> 18:41.340]  somebody protecting my high ass. I appreciate that you're out there doing it because back in the day,
[18:41.340 --> 18:46.220]  they just find motherfuckers to do it. I'm tall and slender and healthy and smart and fucking
[18:46.220 --> 18:51.100]  fast and agile. Guess what? I'd be at war. You go shoot people. I'd be like, no,
[18:51.980 --> 18:58.700]  nope, not for me. Thank you. I do appreciate it and I do respect it. I'll never disrespect a soldier
[18:58.700 --> 19:02.220]  or anything like that. Thank you. Let me find my place in this message. Wanted to make sure to
[19:02.220 --> 19:07.580]  catch up on that. Thank you for putting your life on the line and getting injured, man. I'm
[19:07.580 --> 19:13.340]  sorry for that. Anyway, you're welcome for all of the free information. I feel like I owe this. I
[19:13.340 --> 19:17.660]  don't know what that even means, but it comes out of me naturally. I was compelled to do a podcast.
[19:17.660 --> 19:22.620]  It felt like I owed the world to do it. I try not to bring my religious or my faithful talk into
[19:22.620 --> 19:28.780]  this too much, but when Joss says some stuff, I've got to listen. Joss said, Rasta Jeff, do a podcast
[19:28.780 --> 19:31.900]  and teach all the people how to grow weed because they love the way you grow weed and they love your
[19:31.900 --> 19:35.820]  photography. Why would you keep that to yourself? Send them home so they can grow weed just as good
[19:35.820 --> 19:42.060]  as yours. I went, okay. I bought gear and I have a podcast. It came out of me. Playing the drums
[19:42.060 --> 19:45.980]  happens the same way. Joss says, what if you put the beats here instead of doing it this way? I go,
[19:45.980 --> 19:50.540]  yeah, John, I'm going to do that and shit works for me. When I listen to Joss, follow Joss guidance
[19:50.540 --> 19:57.820]  and give thanks for it and don't stray too far. Things go really well. This podcast comes, it has
[19:57.820 --> 20:04.220]  to happen. I think I'd spontaneously combust or melt down or something if I didn't do this podcast.
[20:04.860 --> 20:10.220]  It's got to be free. It's for the people. It's karmic. I don't know. I've got to be doing it.
[20:10.220 --> 20:13.740]  Thank you for noticing that I'm doing it and I'm putting my heart and soul into it, my time and
[20:13.740 --> 20:18.940]  energy, and it's free. I do ask for Patreon contributions, but I don't put the show behind
[20:18.940 --> 20:24.620]  a paywall. Even if you can't help me on Patreon, you still get it. The people on Patreon, they're
[20:24.620 --> 20:28.860]  in a position where they can help and they do that. I understand how that goes. I want it free.
[20:29.420 --> 20:35.100]  I'm fucking rambling today. Let's keep going. It says, free of charge. Without this podcast,
[20:35.100 --> 20:39.580]  I don't know if I would have taken the plunge into growing. Also, you've given me passion and
[20:39.580 --> 20:44.460]  some purpose through growing. This hobby of growing and cannabis has had such a profound,
[20:44.460 --> 20:51.900]  positive impact on getting my health and my life back together. That makes all of the money I spent
[20:51.900 --> 20:55.820]  on all this equipment right here, all the time I spent today setting up, the time I spent trying
[20:55.820 --> 20:59.820]  to balance this fucking light on the edge of my desk right here, those couple of sentences
[21:00.540 --> 21:06.780]  make all of this effort worth it. There's somebody out there who, soldiers, I hate to even go down
[21:06.780 --> 21:10.860]  this thought, but soldiers take their own lives. People who are in this type of position, if they
[21:10.860 --> 21:15.340]  don't have something to live for, if they don't have a positive, they cling to the negative and
[21:15.340 --> 21:20.940]  they take their own lives. I don't want to judge my friend here, but we're giving this person
[21:20.940 --> 21:25.500]  positive light at the end of a dark, dark fucking tunnel. That feels really good. It says, we've
[21:25.500 --> 21:30.300]  given him passion and purpose. That's what people need. Without passion and purpose, we get lonely
[21:30.300 --> 21:34.860]  and dark and depressed. Passion and purpose are what we live for. That's what keeps you inspired.
[21:34.860 --> 21:39.500]  Without passion and purpose, you're a fucking couch potato. We've given our friend passion
[21:39.500 --> 21:45.740]  and purpose through growing cannabis. The hobby of growing cannabis has had a profound impact
[21:45.740 --> 21:51.820]  on health and life, mental, physical, spiritual. You feel better because you're spending time with
[21:51.820 --> 21:55.020]  your plants. You're in there. When you're spending time with the plants, you got to think about them.
[21:55.020 --> 21:59.260]  You have to pay attention to them. You can't think about the post-traumatic stress that's in the
[21:59.260 --> 22:03.100]  mind. You've got to focus on the plants. You're thinking about the plants. You're getting away
[22:03.100 --> 22:08.860]  from the PTSD. Then you've got an outcome that you can be proud of. You're proud of that. Then
[22:08.860 --> 22:14.780]  you get to smoke that outcome. Now you're stoned. Now the PTSD, the problems, that's all gone.
[22:14.780 --> 22:19.500]  Guess what? We get to wake up tomorrow and go back in the garden and do it all over again.
[22:19.500 --> 22:23.580]  Now, since we're feeling better, spending time away from our own thoughts, spending time in the
[22:23.580 --> 22:27.340]  garden, we start feeling better, consuming a product that makes us feel better, getting a
[22:27.340 --> 22:31.980]  better attitude. Now, maybe we can have better relationships with people. Simple things like
[22:31.980 --> 22:37.420]  that will compound. Maybe after a few months, you'll develop a relationship. Maybe that guy at
[22:37.420 --> 22:40.620]  the store that you just keep your hat down because you don't want to deal with the cashier at the
[22:40.620 --> 22:44.700]  store, maybe you'll say, hey, thank you. Have a good day. They'll go, damn, that guy just told me
[22:44.700 --> 22:48.780]  to have a good day. Nobody's told me to have a good day all day. Instead of yelling at their
[22:48.780 --> 22:53.340]  wife when they get home, they'll go, hey, honey, I brought you a Snickers bar. Ripples, you guys,
[22:53.340 --> 22:57.020]  ripples. I know I got rambly there, but that's how small ripples fucking happen.
[22:57.740 --> 23:02.700]  Let's get fucking focused here. Profound impact on getting your life and health back together.
[23:03.260 --> 23:06.860]  Thank you. I love hearing stuff like that. It says, the next thing to tell you is that
[23:07.900 --> 23:13.340]  you have provided a positive impact both on my mental health and my garden. There are days where
[23:13.340 --> 23:19.180]  a hole of depression has sucked me so far down that I don't even have the willpower to go water
[23:19.180 --> 23:23.660]  my plants. But this is where your little voice, little voice, bro, I got to turn up my microphone.
[23:23.660 --> 23:28.300]  Just picking on you, brother. This is where my little voice pops into your head. It says,
[23:28.300 --> 23:34.540]  Rasta Jeff says, be the best grower I can be. And I do my best. And that will be all the thanks he
[23:34.540 --> 23:39.340]  needs. I love that, dude. I love that. I always say if you can't help me out on Patreon, just
[23:39.340 --> 23:44.540]  take care of your plants the best you can. Make your plants happy. Love them for me. That is free.
[23:44.540 --> 23:49.340]  This guy's doing it. Sometimes that PTSD and depression can be a bitch. Trust me. I come on
[23:49.340 --> 23:53.660]  here and I smile. When I had that head injury, there were terrible thoughts in my head. I couldn't
[23:53.660 --> 23:57.660]  deal with what my brain was doing to me. There were dark, dark alleys that I didn't want to go down.
[23:58.220 --> 24:02.460]  Without good friends, I may have journeyed down some of those alleys. Without my mama having my
[24:02.460 --> 24:06.220]  back, without Mike checking on me, without all the other people that were around loving me,
[24:06.220 --> 24:12.060]  things may have not have been as pretty as they came out. So depression, PTSD can be a hell of a
[24:12.060 --> 24:16.780]  bitch. I get it. When you hear my little voice in there and you go, bro, just go water those plants.
[24:16.780 --> 24:21.340]  The plants are going to make you so happy. Just go water the plants. I love that. That gets you up
[24:21.340 --> 24:26.780]  and gets you moving. Thank you. I love that. Good work, soldier. Where are we now? Rasta Jeff says,
[24:26.780 --> 24:33.660]  water the plants. Let's see. That is all the motivation I need that I sometimes begin to the
[24:33.660 --> 24:39.500]  long crawl out of that hole. I hope on those days you feel that extra positivity vibe coming through
[24:39.500 --> 24:44.620]  the universe. So thank you for being such a positive support to the community and to those
[24:44.620 --> 24:50.460]  like me. Bro, this is probably my favorite email I've gotten in a long time. I've gotten some
[24:50.460 --> 24:54.700]  pretty cool messages. It's going to go on. There is more. It says, there are people who go through
[24:54.700 --> 24:59.100]  life not knowing that they have truly impacted someone's life and also potentially pushed them
[24:59.100 --> 25:04.300]  onto a different path. Cannabis and you have potentially given me that push and have helped
[25:04.300 --> 25:10.140]  me during my long road of rehab over the last couple of years. So what path you have possibly
[25:10.140 --> 25:15.660]  sent me down? I'm currently upgrading my high school courses to possibly go into a program for
[25:15.660 --> 25:23.260]  microbiology at a local college. Bro, our friend here was having a hard time struggling and is now
[25:25.100 --> 25:29.740]  upgrading high school courses and possibly going to a program for microbiology.
[25:29.740 --> 25:33.660]  We're sparking brains and changing futures here at the show, you guys. This is amazing.
[25:33.660 --> 25:36.860]  I didn't realize that my push was going this far. I'm not going to let it go to my head. I'm going
[25:36.860 --> 25:41.100]  to let it go to my heart. Thank you, Tonto. This is fucking awesome. I wish you all the best.
[25:41.100 --> 25:46.140]  If I can do anything else, if you have any specific help that I can offer you, send me a message. Let
[25:46.140 --> 25:51.900]  me know. I'd be honored to help you out. Stay in school. Don't be a fool. Do good, man. Go to
[25:53.100 --> 25:58.300]  microbiology college. I can't even say the word and you're going to school for it. He wraps it up
[25:58.300 --> 26:03.260]  with, I will end this with, I want you to know that you have made a difference in someone's life.
[26:03.260 --> 26:09.980]  Thank you for being an educator, podcaster, grower, friend, breeder, and a good human being
[26:09.980 --> 26:15.820]  from Tonto. Tonto, thank you. Thank you so much, brother. These messages mean a lot to me.
[26:17.420 --> 26:22.220]  I jokingly wrote that this message is like recharge for my soul. It's like you just gave me
[26:22.220 --> 26:29.500]  my weekly dose of recharge and I want to grow vigorously. Man, this is awesome. I am one click
[26:29.500 --> 26:32.860]  of emotions away from a small tear in my eye, to tell you the honest truth. This is a fucking
[26:32.860 --> 26:37.980]  amazing message. I feel it in my heart. It's recharging me. Thank you. This is inspiring and
[26:37.980 --> 26:42.780]  keeps me going. You guys, this is what makes me do a free podcast. Feedback like this. Tonto,
[26:42.780 --> 26:48.220]  thank you. Fist bump, handshake, salute, however you want to do it, bro. Thank you. I respect you
[26:48.220 --> 26:52.140]  and appreciate your support. All right. I want to keep moving because I've got a lot of messages.
[26:52.140 --> 26:54.540]  I don't even know how long I've been going. It doesn't really matter. We're just going to keep
[26:54.540 --> 26:58.780]  going. I'm the boss. I didn't say we had to quit yet. It's a good show. We're having fun. Look
[26:58.780 --> 27:03.420]  good. Feel good. Let's keep moving. This is more of a grow question. I feel like I've moved into
[27:03.420 --> 27:07.020]  the grow question part of the stack. I want to move that message out of there so you guys can't
[27:07.020 --> 27:11.020]  read my scribbles on there. Yeah, I'm insecure about my handwriting on that paper. That's my
[27:11.020 --> 27:14.700]  business. Thank you for hanging out, guys. We've gotten so comfortable together. I hope you're as
[27:14.700 --> 27:20.620]  comfortable with me as I am with you by now. 574 episodes. What a fucking party. This message comes
[27:20.620 --> 27:25.180]  from our friend Riley in Illinois and it says, what up, Rasta Jeff? This is Riley from Illinois
[27:25.180 --> 27:29.340]  back with yet another question. Don't be shy, bro. I love answering your questions.
[27:29.340 --> 27:33.980]  It says, thanks again for all of your help with my previous question. I had a hermaphrodite and
[27:33.980 --> 27:40.860]  it was likely caused by an extension cord that has an orange light up tip. That's possible.
[27:40.860 --> 27:45.820]  That's possible. If that much light caused that plant to herb, I would just get rid of those
[27:45.820 --> 27:51.180]  genetics. That's too finicky. Anyway, and I know what you mean. Sometimes those extension cords
[27:51.180 --> 27:54.300]  have the orange light up tips. You can find it in the dark and you know where to plug in. I know
[27:54.300 --> 28:00.300]  what you mean, but I'd still reconsider. Anyway, it says, I sprayed the room down and my next crop
[28:00.300 --> 28:06.860]  is looking beautiful with no intersex plants yet. Yeah, keep an eye on them, bro. Keep an eye on
[28:06.860 --> 28:10.620]  them. Hopefully you don't have that problem again. Hopefully you've gotten rid of that extension
[28:10.620 --> 28:14.860]  cord. Hopefully you checked that there were no light leaks. Let's stay focused. There is a brand
[28:14.860 --> 28:20.620]  new question. It says, I do have another question for you. I accidentally left my UV supplement
[28:20.620 --> 28:25.900]  light on overnight. How long does it typically take for plants to show hermaphroditic traits?
[28:26.540 --> 28:32.700]  Will one day of UV being on for 16 hours while all of the other lights off cause this plant to
[28:32.700 --> 28:38.060]  herm? I'm sure you can't say 100% as there are many other factors that can be at play, but any of your
[28:38.060 --> 28:43.740]  advice is greatly appreciated. Let me write down a note that I forgot to write.
[28:44.300 --> 28:51.820]  Okay, there we go. Notes on the fly. So our friend Riley here has left his UV light on for 16 hours.
[28:51.820 --> 28:56.700]  That means it was on your plants. If you're in flower, let's see, if you're in veg,
[28:56.700 --> 29:02.220]  this is not a problem. If you're in flower, I'm not sure why it was on for 16 extra hours.
[29:02.220 --> 29:06.460]  You got a 12-12 cycle that should have gone off. Anyway, the light stayed on. That's the bottom
[29:06.860 --> 29:12.940]  Honestly, I am not educated in UV lighting. When it comes to cannabis growing, cultivation,
[29:12.940 --> 29:17.180]  cannabis production, commercial growing, feeding plants, loving plants, knowing plants,
[29:17.180 --> 29:23.420]  I will say that lighting is my weakest part of that whole subject. I know the plants very well.
[29:23.420 --> 29:27.580]  I can look at plants and tell you what's wrong with them. I can breed plants. I can fix grow rooms.
[29:28.300 --> 29:34.300]  I am a little bit uneducated as far as UV lighting. I'm not sure why it's on.
[29:34.300 --> 29:41.580]  I'm a little bit uneducated, not as educated as I should be when it comes to grow lights and grow light technology.
[29:41.580 --> 29:45.900]  All those graphs and things, my brain, honestly, my brain just isn't interested. I want to learn
[29:45.900 --> 29:50.300]  about it. My brain goes, nah, let's go look at microbes or something. So I go read about microbes.
[29:50.300 --> 29:55.260]  I could do that. I probably shouldn't, but that's what my brain chooses to do. And then we let
[29:55.260 --> 29:59.340]  guys like Keith from Blacksail, big shout out to Keith from Blacksail. Let's get you on the show,
[29:59.340 --> 30:04.060]  bro. Come talk on my show about the McCree curve and teach me about lighting and help me understand
[30:04.060 --> 30:07.820]  lighting a little bit better. That's my official invite to you, Keith. I'll reach out via text here
[30:07.820 --> 30:11.980]  this week and try to get you on the show. But honestly, I'm not educated in lighting. So I don't
[30:11.980 --> 30:16.460]  know enough about specifically UVs to talk. I'm going to talk about plants in general.
[30:19.500 --> 30:25.180]  This is going to be very, very plant specific, very cultivar specific. I don't know what plant
[30:25.180 --> 30:29.980]  you're working with. You may have multiple plants in the room. Some will react differently than
[30:30.060 --> 30:35.020]  others to this light error. This is basically the same as a light leak. You had light interruptions
[30:35.020 --> 30:40.460]  during your dark period. This could cause problems. So it's going to be very plant specific.
[30:40.460 --> 30:47.260]  I would watch for problems. Watch and see if you see male flowers popping up on any branches of
[30:47.260 --> 30:51.900]  your plants. Look on the top branches, look on the lower branches. Don't just look at the tops and
[30:51.900 --> 30:55.660]  think you're okay. Look down in the lower part of the plant where you don't get a lot of light.
[30:55.660 --> 31:01.900]  Look and see if you've got male flowers popping up out of those buds anywhere on that plant. Look
[31:01.900 --> 31:06.860]  very carefully on all of the plants that are in there. Watch for intersex traits. Watch for male
[31:06.860 --> 31:13.260]  flowers. Check now and then also keep checking throughout the entire growth cycle. They may take
[31:13.260 --> 31:18.460]  a little bit to pop up. That is one of your major parts of this question. How long until they pop up?
[31:18.460 --> 31:24.060]  You may never see male flowers. You may never see pollen sacks. You may never see anthers.
[31:24.060 --> 31:30.060]  But you may get seeds at the end. So it is hard to guess. You may not know exactly what happened
[31:30.060 --> 31:34.140]  until you harvest and cut them down and see what you've got. You're gonna have to chop it down. And
[31:34.140 --> 31:37.980]  when you're trimming it, you'll know if there are seeds in there. You'll start seeing buds with the
[31:37.980 --> 31:42.620]  calyxes are just extra swollen. There's a seed inside of there. Drop those seeds out. See what
[31:42.620 --> 31:49.740]  you've got. Then watch for seeds. If you've got seeds in there, I would say grow some of the
[31:49.820 --> 31:54.380]  seeds. That's gonna be fun. You may have just accidentally made a bunch of seeds for yourself
[31:54.380 --> 32:00.540]  to play with. Don't sell the seeds. If you did make seeds, don't be that guy that decides to
[32:00.540 --> 32:05.260]  sell them. Do not sell these seeds. These are accidental seeds. They're not made for the market.
[32:05.260 --> 32:09.740]  They're made for you, possibly some of your grow friends. If you've got some friends that need some
[32:09.740 --> 32:15.420]  seeds, you can donate these seeds to them. If they come with a solid disclaimer, hey, these were
[32:15.980 --> 32:20.540]  accidental light leak seeds. I don't know if these are gonna be hermaphrodites, if they're gonna be
[32:20.540 --> 32:24.620]  feminized seeds, or if they're gonna be wild mutants. They could be anything. They've got a
[32:24.620 --> 32:29.420]  lot of potential to be problematic. They've also got a lot of potential to be real fucking hitters.
[32:30.300 --> 32:36.700]  I wrote down Gorilla Glue number four was an accidental pollination that made a champion. Of
[32:36.700 --> 32:40.860]  course, that was a male-female cross to the best of my knowledge, but it was an accident.
[32:40.860 --> 32:46.460]  Golden Goat was an accident. Of course, that was a male-female pollination. Again, an accident.
[32:46.460 --> 32:51.180]  Girl Scout Cookies. There's a lot of controversy around the Girl Scout Cookies line. I think Girl
[32:51.180 --> 32:55.500]  Scout Cookies was bag seed. I don't think anybody really knows what happened, but if it was bag
[32:55.500 --> 32:59.100]  seed, that's the same as what you've got. See, they came from buds, and we don't know where it
[32:59.100 --> 33:04.060]  came from, and it grew out to be the biggest fucking trend in cannabis for several years.
[33:04.060 --> 33:08.220]  A lot of the controversy in cannabis is around that strain. Still is. I don't even know what the
[33:08.220 --> 33:13.580]  real cross of it is. There you go. Cookies got real popular, and it was bag seed. Now, let's talk
[33:13.580 --> 33:20.540]  about the entire chem dog family was bag seed. That was some of the most amazing herb ever found.
[33:20.540 --> 33:28.540]  Chem 91, Chem 4, Chem D, Chem Sister. Excuse me. All of the subsequent chem crosses that came from there,
[33:28.540 --> 33:34.860]  all of those chem crosses came from one bag of weed. If you don't know what the story of chem dog
[33:34.860 --> 33:38.620]  and the legend of the 13 beans is, that is something that you should research if you consider
[33:38.620 --> 33:43.020]  yourself a cannabis historian or someone that's really interested in cannabis if you're a weed
[33:43.020 --> 33:49.180]  nerd. Chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans. Chem bought some weed. There were 13 seeds in there.
[33:49.180 --> 33:53.580]  He grew a few of them. That's where the chem dog lineage came from. That was bag seed.
[33:53.580 --> 33:58.700]  If there are seeds in your bud, they are bag seed. Like I said a moment ago, they've got the potential
[33:58.700 --> 34:03.980]  to be the next Chem 91, the next Gorilla Glue number four, or they can also be the next thing
[34:04.060 --> 34:08.700]  that fuck up your garden and wreak havoc in your grow room. If you did make those seeds, grow
[34:08.700 --> 34:12.460]  them yourself and see what you've got. Maybe you've got some fun in there. Maybe you've got some
[34:12.460 --> 34:17.820]  problems. It's always fun to grow seeds that you made, even if it was an accident. I know you
[34:17.820 --> 34:23.740]  want to know how long until you're going to see herb. Seven to 10 days probably, maybe 14 days,
[34:24.300 --> 34:28.860]  maybe a little bit later. It all depends on how those plants react. I'm not sure what cuts you've
[34:28.860 --> 34:32.300]  got in there. I'm not sure how sensitive they are to light. I'm not sure what their critical
[34:32.300 --> 34:37.740]  periods are. I'm not sure who bred them. I don't know what's up with those plants. I don't want to
[34:37.740 --> 34:43.500]  give you any false hope, but look out for seeds, look out for problems, and just pay close attention.
[34:43.500 --> 34:47.820]  I'm going to take a drink and then I've got one more thing to ramble about on this message.
[34:55.350 --> 35:00.230]  If they are seeded, they are not a total loss. First, you've got a bunch of seeds to play with.
[35:00.230 --> 35:04.390]  As a breeder, that's fun. Even if they're not available for market or something you want to
[35:04.390 --> 35:09.110]  sell, grow them. See what you've got. Run 10 of them. Run them in beer cups. Put them in a beer cup.
[35:09.110 --> 35:12.630]  Veg them out until they're three and three quarters inches tall, the size of a GI Joe,
[35:12.630 --> 35:16.710]  and then put them into flower and see what you get. They could be fucking awesome. They could
[35:16.710 --> 35:20.870]  be total shit, but if they're in a beer cup, there are only 10 of them, you're only wasting so much
[35:20.870 --> 35:25.430]  space. Find out what you've got. They could be really fucking cool. Now, if they are seeded,
[35:25.990 --> 35:30.630]  you can still... I wouldn't want to really smoke the flower if it's seeded. You can, but you got
[35:30.630 --> 35:33.830]  to clean the fucking seeds out of the flower before you smoke it. That's a pain in the ass.
[35:33.830 --> 35:38.630]  It's like old school back in the day. We don't need to do that, but you can process and use
[35:38.630 --> 35:43.590]  seeded herbs. You can extract it. You can make edibles out of it. You can make bubble hash out
[35:43.590 --> 35:47.750]  of it. If you find out there's seeds in there, run it through the bubble bags. You're just going
[35:47.750 --> 35:51.430]  to separate the seeds and everything just like you normally would. The seeds are going to be
[35:51.430 --> 35:56.630]  right there in the mix. You can still make bubble out of it. You can also still make BHO. If you're
[35:56.630 --> 36:03.510]  one of those guys that is still running BHO, you can absolutely make BHO out of seeded products.
[36:03.510 --> 36:08.950]  You can make BHO, grind it up, pull the seeds out, or just pack the fucking seeded buds into
[36:08.950 --> 36:13.190]  the tube and extract it just like that. If you're making diamonds and sauce, do your method with
[36:13.190 --> 36:18.310]  the seeded product. Just get the seeds out or don't. That is up to you. One thing I'd recommend,
[36:18.310 --> 36:23.030]  though, do not press it if there are seeds in there. That's probably obvious to most people,
[36:23.030 --> 36:28.950]  but to some people, I am not certain that that's obvious. Let's not go pressing the seeded bud.
[36:28.950 --> 36:33.190]  It'll blow up like popcorn. It'll be like when you used to smoke a seed in the joint.
[36:33.190 --> 36:38.870]  You don't want to do that. It is not a total loss even if it is seeded. Sorry, I'm making myself an
[36:38.870 --> 36:45.350]  edit note. It is not a total loss even if it is seeded. You can still make bubble hash. You can
[36:45.350 --> 36:49.590]  make BHO. You can make butters. You could probably make sabs and topicals and whatever else you want
[36:49.590 --> 36:55.510]  to do with it, but don't press it because you don't want blowing up seeds like a popcorn bowl.
[36:56.630 --> 37:00.470]  I wish I could give you better advice. I wish I could tell you exactly when they're going to
[37:00.550 --> 37:03.750]  herm, if they are going to herm, but I don't know that that's going to happen.
[37:03.750 --> 37:09.510]  My best advice is keep an eye on each and every single plant. Look at every plant every day. Pay
[37:09.510 --> 37:14.310]  attention. Look at the top. Look in the middle. Absolutely look at the bottom. When you're doing
[37:14.310 --> 37:19.110]  work in there, just look around at the plants. Do what I call the grower's gaze. Just stare at them.
[37:19.830 --> 37:24.470]  Just slowly look across the room and you'll go, oh shit, there it is. You'll see that intersex
[37:24.470 --> 37:28.310]  trait popping up on one of your plants. That's how you're going to find it if you do find it.
[37:28.310 --> 37:31.670]  I'm hoping you don't to tell you the truth. All right, Riley, I've been rambling for quite a few
[37:31.670 --> 37:35.430]  minutes on your message. I'm going to move forward. I want to thank you again for the great message
