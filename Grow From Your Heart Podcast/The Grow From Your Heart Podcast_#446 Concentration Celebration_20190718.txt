[00:30.120 --> 00:31.120]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:31.120 --> 00:32.120]  Thanks, man.
[00:32.120 --> 00:33.120]  What's up, everybody?
[00:33.120 --> 00:34.120]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[00:34.120 --> 00:35.120]  Sorry I cut you off there.
[00:35.120 --> 00:36.120]  No, it's cool.
[00:36.120 --> 00:37.120]  They're not going to respond.
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.480]  I bet a lot of people in our car did say, what's up, Mike?
[00:38.480 --> 00:41.240]  I said that the first time and now it's like my little high.
[00:41.240 --> 00:42.240]  Nice, nice.
[00:42.240 --> 00:43.240]  Well, thanks for being here, bro.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.240]  Yeah, man.
[00:44.240 --> 00:45.240]  Dude, let's...
[00:45.240 --> 00:47.720]  So usually we'd start by talking about what we're dabbing on.
[00:47.720 --> 00:48.720]  I've been dabbing...
[00:48.720 --> 00:49.720]  We've been dabbing on some of everything.
[00:49.720 --> 00:51.400]  I've been dabbing minimally today.
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.880]  After the event that we're going to talk about, dude, my lungs, they were through the marathon.
[00:56.280 --> 00:57.840]  I've been taking it a little easy as well.
[00:57.840 --> 00:59.240]  I had some fun at the event.
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.040]  We're going to talk about this watermelon gelato briefly.
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.880]  Today we're dabbing on some watermelon gelato ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.640]  The potency label says 64.6% THC, 76.7% total cannabinoids.
[01:12.640 --> 01:14.160]  I really like the watermelon gelato.
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.640]  When you take a dab of it, this watermelon candy flavor coats your mouth.
[01:18.640 --> 01:21.600]  And then as you breathe through your mouth a little bit, as the flavor dries out, it
[01:21.600 --> 01:24.040]  turns into a sour apple sort of a flavor.
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.400]  It's so good.
[01:25.920 --> 01:29.920]  When I first hit it, I was like, huh, I didn't really get super high from that.
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.640]  But then about three seconds later, it was like, oh, then about six seconds later, it
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.880]  was like, oh, oh, about 15 seconds later, it was like, oh shit.
[01:38.880 --> 01:39.880]  And then it just keeps going.
[01:39.880 --> 01:42.400]  And that just keeps happening for probably two or three minutes.
[01:42.400 --> 01:45.360]  You just get a little higher and higher and higher from it.
[01:45.360 --> 01:50.840]  I'm really loving the flavor, the aroma, and the effects of the watermelon gelato ambrosia
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.920]  from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:52.920 --> 01:53.920]  It's delicious.
[01:53.920 --> 01:54.920]  Delicious.
[01:55.440 --> 01:58.080]  Rusticheff and White Mike approved.
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.760]  We're going to talk about the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration in this episode.
[02:02.760 --> 02:06.920]  Mike and I and a bunch of other kind folks got to go hang out at this Dude Grows Concentration
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.400]  Celebration hosted by the Dude Grows crew, thrown by my good friend, Scotty Real.
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.800]  Before we get to that part of the podcast, let's do some shout outs to some of our friends
[02:15.800 --> 02:16.800]  on Patreon.
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.440]  I want to start with the big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:19.440 --> 02:21.000]  Shout out to my friend, Glenn G.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.240]  How about a big giant shout out to Ryan S.
[02:23.240 --> 02:26.320]  I owe a huge thank you and a Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:26.320 --> 02:27.320]  Shout out to Eric Ross.
[02:27.320 --> 02:30.800]  I always want to give a giant shout out to our friends over at Hogan's Farms.
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.560]  And of course, last but certainly not least, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast hug, a
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.360]  handshake, and a fist bump to my good friend, Stabby McStabberson.

[03:01.280 --> 03:05.120]  All right, Mike, I feel like we got all the advertising done.
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.600]  Let's talk about this cool ass event in which we got to attend.
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.500]  I want you to talk about it a little bit because I have a podcast where I get to talk and run
[03:13.500 --> 03:14.500]  my face all the time.
[03:14.500 --> 03:15.500]  You go to events all the time.
[03:15.500 --> 03:17.680]  And I get to go to events all of the time.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.400]  You don't get spoiled like I do.
[03:19.400 --> 03:21.480]  You are more focused on other things.
[03:21.480 --> 03:25.640]  You are more on the activism side, doing the ... I call you White Mike because you're like
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.640]  my legal guy.
[03:26.640 --> 03:28.880]  I'm the one out here doing the gross stuff.
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.120]  You're the one in the trenches doing the fucking legal work.
[03:32.120 --> 03:34.800]  Taking care of legislative bills and zoning rules.
[03:34.800 --> 03:38.240]  So without your work, my work would not happen, to tell you the truth.
[03:38.240 --> 03:40.440]  You're a big part of what I'm able to do.
[03:40.440 --> 03:42.520]  And I see that and I know that that's a thing.
[03:42.520 --> 03:43.520]  Yeah, for sure, brother.
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.020]  You've been there for a long time also.
[03:45.020 --> 03:50.340]  So I want to give you an opportunity to talk about the Dude Grows concentration celebration
[03:50.340 --> 03:52.100]  that happened at Cultivated Synergy.
[03:52.100 --> 03:53.860]  Man, I'm glad you came.
[03:53.860 --> 03:54.860]  What did you think?
[03:54.860 --> 04:02.100]  First, I just want to say thank you to the whole DGC crew for throwing an awesome party.
[04:02.100 --> 04:03.360]  Such a rad party.
[04:03.360 --> 04:10.740]  The last couple of consumption-friendly events that I've been to, it was an event that was
[04:10.740 --> 04:15.220]  friendly and the consumption part was out in the back corner of the parking lot in a
[04:15.220 --> 04:16.500]  bus.
[04:16.500 --> 04:22.340]  And that was not at all the 710 Cup, which I really, really enjoyed.
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.380]  Thank you for not shoving us all into little buses.
[04:26.380 --> 04:28.620]  Shout out to that location for letting us do that.
[04:28.620 --> 04:29.740]  It's a wonderful location.
[04:29.740 --> 04:31.660]  I'd never been there before and I loved it.
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.700]  The staff is great.
[04:32.700 --> 04:36.100]  All of the people that help us out when we get there to load in, they're like, do you
[04:36.100 --> 04:37.100]  guys need help with anything?
[04:37.100 --> 04:38.580]  And I'm like, no, we've got everything.
[04:38.580 --> 04:40.060]  We need a table and a spot.
[04:40.060 --> 04:42.220]  And they say, pick a spot, here's a table.
[04:42.220 --> 04:44.980]  And they let me set up and anything I asked for, they brought to me.
[04:44.980 --> 04:46.140]  I needed chairs for...
[04:46.300 --> 04:47.300]  I had granny with me.
[04:47.300 --> 04:49.260]  I said, I need a couple of nice chairs.
[04:49.260 --> 04:51.500]  And they pointed like, which of these would you like?
[04:51.500 --> 04:53.820]  And they gave me a selection of really nice chairs.
[04:53.820 --> 04:56.900]  I had great chairs for granny and grumpy grandpa there.
[04:56.900 --> 04:57.900]  But yeah, that was a great venue.
[04:57.900 --> 04:58.900]  Mike, I cut you off.
[04:58.900 --> 04:59.900]  Keep going, brother.
[04:59.900 --> 05:03.460]  The space was great.
[05:03.460 --> 05:04.900]  Just the feel of the event was great.
[05:04.900 --> 05:12.100]  There wasn't a beer truck right in the front, right as you walked in, which I really appreciated.
[05:12.100 --> 05:15.140]  Free water, that was pretty epic for a consumption event.
[05:15.140 --> 05:18.300]  When I saw that, I was like, man, they fucking thought of everything.
[05:18.300 --> 05:19.860]  They really did try to think of everything.
[05:19.860 --> 05:20.860]  There was a...
[05:20.860 --> 05:22.660]  From start to finish, it was a smooth event.
[05:22.660 --> 05:27.780]  There was like no stubbed toes, no bonked elbows, no hurt feelings that I saw.
[05:27.780 --> 05:29.860]  It looked like everything ran really smoothly.
[05:29.860 --> 05:31.220]  I would agree with that.
[05:31.220 --> 05:35.380]  Actually, in my Instagram post thanking Scotty for the event, I said, the party went off
[05:35.380 --> 05:36.380]  without a hitch.
[05:36.380 --> 05:37.380]  It went very well.
[05:37.380 --> 05:38.380]  It was a pretty smooth event.
[05:38.380 --> 05:47.940]  Yeah, usually on the quiet consumption event, there's a lot of snags just because of how
[05:47.940 --> 05:51.500]  it's set up or how it wasn't planned out as well as it should have been.
[05:51.500 --> 05:53.500]  There was none of that with the DGC Cup.
[05:53.500 --> 05:54.500]  It was all smooth.
[05:54.500 --> 05:58.540]  There were so many different aspects of this event that there were so many opportunities
[05:58.540 --> 06:00.220]  for things to go wrong.
[06:00.220 --> 06:04.340]  Something did kind of go wrong, but nobody even noticed because there were so many good
[06:04.340 --> 06:07.460]  people involved in it that it got overlooked and it got skipped.
[06:07.540 --> 06:09.660]  Nobody even said, hey, what happened to this?
[06:09.660 --> 06:10.860]  We had an event planned.
[06:10.860 --> 06:13.380]  We had a speaker planned to do a presentation.
[06:13.380 --> 06:15.500]  He was unable to make it because he had a family emergency.
[06:15.500 --> 06:19.020]  I know exactly what happened and I completely think that that was more important than this
[06:19.020 --> 06:20.020]  event.
[06:20.020 --> 06:21.020]  You got to take care of your family.
[06:21.020 --> 06:22.020]  But we covered for him.
[06:22.020 --> 06:25.220]  Nobody even realized, hey, this guy didn't do the talk he said he was going to do because
[06:25.220 --> 06:28.860]  we had so much fun and made it such a good event that everybody was like, oh, wait, that
[06:28.860 --> 06:31.220]  may have broken up the party anyway.
[06:31.220 --> 06:36.980]  The only snag I hit was parking and that's sort of a key component to a successful event
[06:36.980 --> 06:40.900]  is a lot of people attend and some people get there a half hour late like I did.
[06:40.900 --> 06:43.660]  I have to truck it in for a minute.
[06:43.660 --> 06:47.060]  That part of my story for the event was going to be the traffic getting up there.
[06:47.060 --> 06:49.660]  We live 120 ish miles from the event.
[06:49.660 --> 06:53.100]  Yeah, that's it was traffic was bad that day, kind of everywhere.
[06:53.100 --> 06:56.220]  But I mean, I didn't count that for the event.
[06:56.220 --> 06:57.220]  No, I know.
[06:57.220 --> 07:00.020]  I'm just saying part of my story involves traffic.
[07:00.020 --> 07:01.020]  I got it.
[07:01.020 --> 07:03.460]  I got a fucking stress headache just from the traffic from getting up there.
[07:03.460 --> 07:04.460]  I was like, ah.
[07:04.940 --> 07:08.140]  And by the time I got there, I was ready to load in and get dabbed out.
[07:08.140 --> 07:09.340]  And they made it super easy.
[07:09.340 --> 07:10.420]  Like there's a table.
[07:10.420 --> 07:11.420]  Here's the torch.
[07:11.420 --> 07:12.420]  Have a good time.
[07:12.420 --> 07:13.420]  It was super cool in there.
[07:13.420 --> 07:18.300]  The reason I was late because I got caught in rain traffic and it was a heavy downpour
[07:18.300 --> 07:20.980]  right over top of the event while I was trying to get to it.
[07:20.980 --> 07:22.140]  And that's the RINO district.
[07:22.140 --> 07:25.140]  You should always expect shitty parking situations in the RINO district.
[07:25.140 --> 07:27.260]  I knew what I was getting into when I got there.
[07:27.260 --> 07:31.540]  And like it wasn't even really it's like when I pulled up and I saw that I immediately had
[07:31.540 --> 07:32.740]  to park a couple blocks away.
[07:32.740 --> 07:36.620]  I thought, man, like it already looks like a good event pulling up.
[07:36.620 --> 07:39.260]  I see a lot of people inside.
[07:39.260 --> 07:43.260]  I could see kind of just through one of the doors as I was driving past.
[07:43.260 --> 07:45.980]  And I was happy as soon as I walked in.
[07:45.980 --> 07:49.380]  I saw a bunch of people that we knew and everybody was having a good time.
[07:49.380 --> 07:58.660]  There was what, 20 different booths, each with delicious hash, friendly people and some
[07:58.660 --> 07:59.660]  decent swag.
[07:59.660 --> 08:00.660]  It was a good time.
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.980]  I would agree with all of that.
[08:03.980 --> 08:04.980]  Granny showed up.
[08:04.980 --> 08:05.980]  We had Deb and Granny hanging out.
[08:05.980 --> 08:06.980]  That was always a good time.
[08:06.980 --> 08:07.980]  I love running into Granny.
[08:07.980 --> 08:09.460]  We have so much fun together.
[08:09.460 --> 08:12.740]  So you always have fun with Granny, no matter what.
[08:12.740 --> 08:13.920]  She brings a party.
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.740]  She has a party in her own.
[08:15.740 --> 08:17.860]  She brings, so I had my own booth set up.
[08:17.860 --> 08:19.580]  I have my brand new iReed Genetics booth.
[08:19.580 --> 08:24.860]  I debuted that at the Dude Grows event, but I also set another table next to it for Granny
[08:24.860 --> 08:25.860]  and Grumpy Grandpa.
[08:26.060 --> 08:30.820]  And it's a good thing that I did because when she showed up, she had boxes of raw papers
[08:30.820 --> 08:31.820]  to give away.
[08:31.820 --> 08:36.180]  She had Deb and Granny hat pins, Deb and Granny stickers, Deb and Granny rolling trays.
[08:36.180 --> 08:40.700]  If you could wear it, smoke it, use it to consume, wave it around as a cannabis banner.
[08:40.700 --> 08:45.580]  Granny probably had one with her to give to you and also give you a hug at the event.
[08:45.580 --> 08:46.980]  She is a very generous lady.
[08:46.980 --> 08:48.100]  She brings a lot of good stuff.
[08:48.100 --> 08:51.540]  She had pop sockets for phones, but I think I have a brand new ooze pop socket for my
[08:51.540 --> 08:52.540]  phone.
[08:52.540 --> 08:54.660]  Yeah, she came with all kinds of good shit.
[08:55.660 --> 08:58.460]  Hanging out with Scotty is always a good time, dude.
[08:58.460 --> 09:01.460]  Yeah, we can't talk about Granny without talking about Scotty.
[09:01.460 --> 09:05.220]  Getting Granny and Scotty in the same area together, taking dabs with them is such a
[09:05.220 --> 09:06.220]  good time.
[09:06.220 --> 09:07.220]  Right.
[09:07.220 --> 09:10.220]  It was more like a big family get-together than anything.
[09:10.220 --> 09:13.940]  That's kind of the way that I think Scotty wanted it.
[09:13.940 --> 09:19.300]  It was also aimed at being an educational event and also a concentrate competition.
[09:19.300 --> 09:23.100]  We'll talk about that a little bit in the later part of the episode.
[09:23.260 --> 09:27.780]  He wanted it to be just a more friendly family, not like family, but like the Canna family,
[09:27.780 --> 09:31.700]  sort of a tighter event, sort of like a family reunion instead of a big old blown out weed
[09:31.700 --> 09:34.580]  expo because those get exhausting and tiresome.
[09:34.580 --> 09:35.580]  Quickly.
[09:35.580 --> 09:36.580]  Yeah.
[09:36.580 --> 09:38.180]  I feel like everybody at this event knew each other.
[09:38.180 --> 09:40.140]  Half of the people that came up, I've already met them.
[09:40.140 --> 09:44.020]  And if I didn't, I was Facebook or Instagram or Cannabuzz friends with them.
[09:44.020 --> 09:46.300]  Shout out to our friends on Cannabuzz.
[09:46.300 --> 09:48.020]  So I knew almost everybody in there.
[09:48.020 --> 09:49.620]  That was a lot of fun.
[09:49.620 --> 09:50.620]  So the drive was crazy.
[09:50.620 --> 09:52.780]  Getting there, getting set up was great.
[09:53.460 --> 09:56.660]  Almost as soon as I got set up and got comfortable, everybody started coming over and giving me
[09:56.660 --> 10:01.740]  dabs and asking me questions about seeds and buying shirts and saying, what's up?
[10:01.740 --> 10:03.900]  Then we started medicating and dabbing out.
[10:03.900 --> 10:05.940]  And that's when it got super fun.
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.380]  I didn't even have a chair yet.
[10:07.380 --> 10:11.860]  I'd been there for 30 seconds and I had a rig with a nail ready to go and a dab in my
[10:11.860 --> 10:12.860]  hand.
[10:12.860 --> 10:13.980]  It was that kind of an event.
[10:13.980 --> 10:15.820]  It was that type of an event.
[10:15.820 --> 10:16.820]  Granny showed up.
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.340]  She set up her table.
[10:18.340 --> 10:20.460]  Then granny went and I was at a booth.
[10:20.460 --> 10:21.460]  I'm running a booth.
[10:21.460 --> 10:27.180]  I miss Amy with me, helping me out, but I don't, uh, Amy can do it, but most people,
[10:27.180 --> 10:29.500]  they want to talk to me when they come to the booth.
[10:29.500 --> 10:31.220]  They're asking questions about the genetics.
[10:31.220 --> 10:32.220]  They want to see me.
[10:32.220 --> 10:33.260]  I'm the guy you go to Disneyland.
[10:33.260 --> 10:34.260]  You want to see Mickey Mouse.
[10:34.260 --> 10:35.500]  You go to I read genetics booth.
[10:35.500 --> 10:37.860]  You want to see Rasta Jeff, a big shout out to Amy.
[10:37.860 --> 10:38.860]  No disrespect to her.
[10:38.860 --> 10:39.860]  I'm not downplaying her.
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.340]  You're pretty much nailed to that booth for the rest of the night.
[10:42.340 --> 10:43.340]  Absolutely.
[10:43.340 --> 10:46.580]  But granny went over to the judging table where the concentrates were and where they
[10:46.580 --> 10:47.580]  were being judged.
[10:47.580 --> 10:51.100]  And Scotty came over and gave me a clipboard and he's like, you got to be a judge, dude.
[10:51.740 --> 10:53.140]  So I told Amy, I was like, I got to do my job.
[10:53.140 --> 10:54.140]  You know what I mean?
[10:54.140 --> 10:55.140]  I'm here for this event.
[10:55.140 --> 10:56.180]  And she's like, go ahead and do your thing.
[10:56.180 --> 10:57.180]  She gives me the go ahead.
[10:57.180 --> 10:58.180]  Look at, she can hold it down.
[10:58.180 --> 10:59.180]  She does a great job.
[10:59.180 --> 11:00.660]  Uh, she takes care of the booth.
[11:00.660 --> 11:04.420]  So I finally got to go over to the judging area for a few with granny.
[11:04.420 --> 11:09.860]  And that was a fun experience going over to that judging table with granny.
[11:09.860 --> 11:15.340]  I'm glad I didn't try to judge, you know, there were, I think there were less than 20
[11:15.340 --> 11:18.540]  complete entries and halfway through that list.
[11:18.540 --> 11:20.660]  I would have been roasted.
[11:21.220 --> 11:23.700]  I think I nailed, I've got a list of winners here that I'll read.
[11:23.700 --> 11:24.700]  Mike Rez.
[11:24.700 --> 11:26.980]  There were a lot of people that were roasted.
[11:26.980 --> 11:30.540]  I was having a conversation with Keith from a Canon lights.
[11:30.540 --> 11:31.740]  I think it's Canon.
[11:31.740 --> 11:32.740]  What's the name of his light company?
[11:32.740 --> 11:33.740]  Shit.
[11:33.740 --> 11:34.740]  I'm sorry, Keith.
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.100]  I can't, he makes cannons or one of the led lights that he makes.
[11:36.100 --> 11:37.100]  Uh, sorry.
[11:37.100 --> 11:39.260]  I can't remember the name of your light company right now, brother, but big shout out, nothing
[11:39.260 --> 11:40.260]  but love and respect.
[11:40.260 --> 11:43.380]  I was talking to Keith and we both said something and looked at each other.
[11:43.380 --> 11:48.100]  And I think whatever one of us said, he was basically like, do you like ice in your water?
[11:48.100 --> 11:50.060]  And I was like, bacon's not my friend.
[11:50.060 --> 11:51.420]  And we looked at each other like, where the fuck?
[11:51.420 --> 11:53.260]  And he goes, everybody is so high here.
[11:53.260 --> 11:54.260]  It was just so funny.
[11:54.260 --> 11:58.060]  Our conversations didn't, but we were talking on two different frequencies.
[11:58.060 --> 11:59.060]  It was so funny.
[11:59.060 --> 12:00.260]  I had the same girl.
[12:00.260 --> 12:03.940]  She came up to the, uh, at the start of the event, she was like, Hey, do you know, dabbing
[12:03.940 --> 12:04.940]  granny?
[12:04.940 --> 12:05.940]  I see you sit next to her.
[12:05.940 --> 12:06.940]  And I was like, yeah, I know granny.
[12:06.940 --> 12:07.940]  What's up?
[12:07.940 --> 12:08.940]  She goes, can you introduce me?
[12:08.940 --> 12:09.940]  I'd love to get a picture.
[12:09.940 --> 12:10.940]  And I go, sure.
[12:10.940 --> 12:13.380]  And before we could take eight steps, she got distracted.
[12:13.380 --> 12:17.420]  And we had that exact same conversation three times.
[12:17.420 --> 12:18.420]  That's funny.
[12:18.420 --> 12:22.540]  I actually got her to stay focused long enough to get a picture with granny.
[12:22.540 --> 12:24.140]  At the judging area.
[12:24.140 --> 12:26.100]  So they had a little area.
[12:26.100 --> 12:29.740]  So if you paid a certain amount of money, or if you were a VIP guest, you got a judge's
[12:29.740 --> 12:30.860]  pass.
[12:30.860 --> 12:34.300]  And with that judge's pass, uh, you could go, you could go look at the concentrates
[12:34.300 --> 12:37.420]  without that, but you weren't really, you could take a dab.
[12:37.420 --> 12:39.500]  Nobody was going to slap you if you weren't a judge.
[12:39.500 --> 12:42.460]  There was enough to share, but we wanted to make sure that the judges all got the dabs
[12:42.460 --> 12:44.300]  first so that we got to sample it.
[12:44.300 --> 12:46.140]  The judging was over.
[12:46.140 --> 12:50.660]  Like I went through like maybe half the line over the course of the event.
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.340]  Just they were getting rid of everything.
[12:52.340 --> 12:53.340]  Oh yeah.
[12:53.340 --> 12:54.340]  They wanted it.
[12:54.340 --> 12:55.340]  You got to dab it.
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.340]  We don't need stuff left over.
[12:56.340 --> 13:02.220]  Uh, but up there for the pro there was a pro category and a home grower category.
[13:02.220 --> 13:08.100]  I nailed the winners in the, um, I think I did them in the backwards order.
[13:08.100 --> 13:09.960]  I said, this number should win first place.
[13:09.960 --> 13:12.060]  This number should win second place in this number should win third place.
[13:12.100 --> 13:15.100]  And I think I got them the exact backwards order.
[13:15.100 --> 13:17.300]  One of them, I opened this product.
[13:17.300 --> 13:19.500]  So they, so I should describe the dabbing area more.
[13:19.500 --> 13:20.500]  That's where I was.
[13:20.500 --> 13:21.500]  You go to the dabbing area.
[13:21.500 --> 13:24.820]  They've got like a, uh, cultivated synergy has like a bar area.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.820]  It's not a bar with alcohol.
[13:25.820 --> 13:29.220]  It looks like the kitchen bar, like the Island and the bar where everybody gathers around
[13:29.220 --> 13:32.940]  in the bar when you're partying, it's where everybody hangs out on, but not the drinking
[13:32.940 --> 13:33.940]  bar.
[13:33.940 --> 13:34.940]  It's an Island, I guess is what that is.
[13:34.940 --> 13:37.860]  So there's an Island in the middle off to the one side there.
[13:37.860 --> 13:39.300]  And all of the concentrates were on there.
[13:39.300 --> 13:40.520]  They had bar stools around that.
[13:40.520 --> 13:43.160]  If you choose to sit on a bar stool, most of us were just standing up.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.160]  You'd bring your rig over there and your torch.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.840]  However you choose to dab the concentrates were there.
[13:47.840 --> 13:48.840]  You could dab it.
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.080]  However you were most comfortable with that way.
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.120]  You could get a proper judging.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.680]  My favorite is this dab rig, this torch, this carb cap.
[13:53.680 --> 13:55.080]  I know that real well.
[13:55.080 --> 13:57.680]  I know what to expect from a dab with this setup.
[13:57.680 --> 13:59.300]  So I took that over there.
[13:59.300 --> 14:03.920]  There were, uh, concentrates of different qualities and textures and appearances and
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.660]  consistencies with a number on them.
[14:06.660 --> 14:11.300]  And I mainly waited until I could see that numbers one, two, and three were available
[14:11.300 --> 14:14.460]  so that I knew I could burn through one, two, and three pretty quick and get one, two, and
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.460]  three down.
[14:15.460 --> 14:17.860]  And then I waited until I saw four or five and six, so I could get some judging figured
[14:17.860 --> 14:20.940]  out and not have to search for all the numbers.
[14:20.940 --> 14:21.940]  There were a couple I didn't dab.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.940]  Honestly, I skipped a couple.
[14:22.940 --> 14:23.940]  I was like, man, nope.
[14:23.940 --> 14:26.420]  I already know that I don't need to try that.
[14:26.420 --> 14:30.780]  And a lot of people say that looks can be deceiving when it comes to a concentrate.
[14:30.780 --> 14:33.260]  There were, I, there was no deception.
[14:33.260 --> 14:36.700]  I knew I didn't need to dab that to know that the others in the lineup were already
[14:36.700 --> 14:37.700]  better.
[14:37.700 --> 14:40.580]  I think that appearance is part of the, uh, the decision when you're shopping at a dispensary,
[14:40.580 --> 14:43.260]  when you're looking for a car looks, make a big decision.
[14:43.260 --> 14:44.260]  I didn't want those.
[14:44.260 --> 14:45.940]  Uh, so I dabbed quite a few of them.
[14:45.940 --> 14:46.940]  I made some notes.
[14:46.940 --> 14:48.660]  I went and hung out with miss Amy, made sure the booth was cool.
[14:48.660 --> 14:51.180]  Came back, did some more dabs, uh, for the pro category.
[14:51.180 --> 14:54.860]  I'm pretty sure I knew which three were going to win top three, but I got number one and
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.300]  number three flipped.
[14:56.300 --> 15:00.300]  I was correct for number two, which I, I knew wouldn't win number one, but I wish it would
[15:00.300 --> 15:02.900]  have because we'll talk about why in a little bit.
[15:03.540 --> 15:08.660]  So for the, uh, the home grower category, I think I nailed that one.
[15:08.660 --> 15:09.660]  Exactly.
[15:09.660 --> 15:10.660]  I think, but I'm not sure who won second place.
[15:10.660 --> 15:12.660]  Cause I can't find the list online.
[15:12.660 --> 15:15.460]  So let me look at my phone here.
[15:15.460 --> 15:16.460]  Everybody was clapping.
[15:16.460 --> 15:17.660]  Nobody was making notes.
[15:17.660 --> 15:20.200]  I was way in the back because I had the booth.
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.940]  My booth was as far away from the event microphone as I could have been.
[15:24.940 --> 15:27.380]  Yeah, it was totally far away from that.
[15:27.380 --> 15:31.020]  So let's talk about, uh, the dude grows pro division winners.
[15:31.020 --> 15:32.380]  I'm going to start from the bottom here.
[15:32.860 --> 15:34.860]  So the first place was Kimmy Jones from dab logic.
[15:34.860 --> 15:40.020]  Uh, second place, I predicted this one would be in the top three.
[15:40.020 --> 15:41.500]  This was one of my favorites.
[15:41.500 --> 15:43.900]  I was talking about this a moment ago and I cut myself off.
[15:43.900 --> 15:49.440]  I was taking the dabs and I opened this one jar and as soon as I opened it, I went, Oh,
[15:49.440 --> 15:50.820]  it felt, it smelled like home.
[15:50.820 --> 15:51.820]  It felt so familiar.
[15:51.820 --> 15:54.900]  I was like, I know this one.
[15:54.900 --> 15:56.220]  And I took a dab out of it.
[15:56.220 --> 16:00.220]  And as soon as the dabber hit the concentrate, I was like, Oh, I know what that is.
[16:00.220 --> 16:03.760]  Like it just cracked open the aroma and the aroma climbed up in my nose and my mouth watered
[16:03.760 --> 16:04.760]  a little bit.
[16:04.760 --> 16:05.900]  And I was like, Oh, I don't even need to dab this.
[16:05.900 --> 16:06.940]  I already know what this is.
[16:06.940 --> 16:08.700]  Of course I took the dab.
[16:08.700 --> 16:12.500]  Number two was Clementine from our friends at apothecary farms.
[16:12.500 --> 16:13.500]  They won second place.
[16:13.500 --> 16:14.500]  That shit was delicious.
[16:14.500 --> 16:19.380]  In my opinion, uh, that should have been number one, but I think consistency and appearance
[16:19.380 --> 16:22.100]  are a lot of what made the number one winner.
[16:22.100 --> 16:26.580]  Number one, uh, number one was mimosa from nomad extracts.
[16:26.580 --> 16:31.380]  I tasted that again, the Clementine is sweet oranges there.
[16:31.380 --> 16:32.380]  Yeah.
[16:32.380 --> 16:33.380]  Their booth was really, they were right next to us.
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.700]  Their booth was packed and it was really nice.
[16:35.700 --> 16:40.140]  Um, I think the main difference between the Clementine and that mimosa, they both had
[16:40.140 --> 16:42.060]  that orange candy flavor.
[16:42.060 --> 16:46.900]  The Clementine is a batter and it looks messy in the container, especially after multiple
[16:46.900 --> 16:48.700]  people have dabbed out of it.
[16:48.700 --> 16:50.820]  That mimosa was beautiful diamonds and sauce.
[16:50.820 --> 16:54.660]  It was such a nice mixture and the diamonds were just the right size.
[16:54.740 --> 16:58.580]  I feel if apothecary would have entered something a little chunkier, they would have had a better
[16:58.580 --> 17:02.380]  chance if they would have entered Clementine Ambrosia, it probably could have taken it.
[17:02.380 --> 17:04.340]  I'm glad they entered a batter though.
[17:04.340 --> 17:05.380]  Like batters.
[17:05.380 --> 17:07.580]  It took second despite it did.
[17:07.580 --> 17:09.980]  And I, it's, it's, it's that good.
[17:09.980 --> 17:12.500]  I've got a jar of that batter sitting here on the table.
[17:12.500 --> 17:14.220]  So that's why it felt like it was home.
[17:14.220 --> 17:15.700]  I've been smoking a lot of that stuff.
[17:15.700 --> 17:19.700]  The diamonds and sauce, you take 15 dabs out of a jar of diamonds and sauce.
[17:19.700 --> 17:21.020]  You've still got diamonds and sauce.
[17:21.060 --> 17:22.060]  Exactly.
[17:22.060 --> 17:23.060]  The same thing with batter.
[17:23.060 --> 17:27.620]  It's like the, the little burnt parts leftover when you're making pancakes.
[17:27.620 --> 17:28.620]  You know what I mean?
[17:28.620 --> 17:30.620]  It looks like a baby food jar that you let your baby eat out of.
[17:30.620 --> 17:31.620]  Yeah.
[17:31.620 --> 17:32.620]  It's just like a mess.
[17:32.620 --> 17:33.620]  I know offense to that batter.
[17:33.620 --> 17:34.620]  That's just what happens to it.
[17:34.620 --> 17:38.580]  So just to recap, third place, Kimmy Jones, second place.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.580]  What was that?
[17:39.580 --> 17:40.740]  Oh, Kimmy Jones and dab logic.
[17:40.740 --> 17:42.420]  Second place Clementine from apothecary.
[17:42.420 --> 17:44.700]  First place mimosa from Nomad extracts.
[17:44.700 --> 17:47.660]  Big shout out to everybody that won in the, uh, the, what is it?
[17:47.660 --> 17:48.660]  Pro division.
[17:48.820 --> 17:53.620]  Everything, all the booths that were set up, all of those were everything I tried from
[17:53.620 --> 17:54.620]  a booth was pretty nice.
[17:54.620 --> 17:55.620]  So that was acceptable.
[17:55.620 --> 18:01.100]  I had two different booths had Rosin that I really liked and I don't like Rosin.
[18:01.100 --> 18:05.900]  One of the, uh, one of the, one of my favorites that I was voting for would probably have
[18:05.900 --> 18:06.900]  been a Rosin.
[18:06.900 --> 18:09.420]  If I got to pick my top five favorite, I think one of them was a Rosin.
[18:09.420 --> 18:11.500]  It was gassy and kind of Kimmy flavored.
[18:11.500 --> 18:14.860]  Uh, in the, so let's talk about the home grower area.
[18:14.860 --> 18:19.180]  I don't have the list because I can't find it posted on any social media anywhere.
[18:19.180 --> 18:21.860]  I do know that number three, I don't know the person's name.
[18:21.860 --> 18:23.180]  I can't think of it off the top of my head.
[18:23.180 --> 18:24.180]  I met the kid.
[18:24.180 --> 18:25.180]  He's a great person.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.940]  He's a good grower, super enthusiastic.
[18:26.940 --> 18:27.940]  He's one of those young dudes.
[18:27.940 --> 18:28.940]  It's like, what's up, bro.
[18:28.940 --> 18:30.100]  Check out what I grew, what I entered.
[18:30.100 --> 18:32.220]  He entered, I've got a nice little portion of it.
[18:32.220 --> 18:33.220]  I'm pointing over there.
[18:33.220 --> 18:34.460]  Like Mike can see where it is.
[18:34.460 --> 18:35.460]  Yeah.
[18:35.460 --> 18:37.020]  There's some golden goat shatter over there.
[18:37.020 --> 18:39.460]  Uh, that golden goat was very beautiful.
[18:39.460 --> 18:41.500]  That one third place, it tastes good.
[18:41.500 --> 18:43.980]  I took a big fat, I knew what that was when I unfolded the parchment.
[18:44.100 --> 18:45.420]  I was like, well, that's a golden goat.
[18:45.420 --> 18:47.580]  And I took a big fat dab of that one.
[18:47.580 --> 18:49.340]  It tasted so golden goat.
[18:49.340 --> 18:51.100]  He did a really perfect job on that one.
[18:51.100 --> 18:52.380]  It shattered that later.
[18:52.380 --> 18:53.380]  It's shattered, bro.
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.380]  And I would smoke it right now.
[18:54.380 --> 18:57.340]  If you put some of it in front of me, I would smoke that shatter and I don't smoke a lot
[18:57.340 --> 18:58.340]  of shatter.
[18:58.340 --> 18:59.720]  So third place was shatter.
[18:59.720 --> 19:00.720]  Second place.
[19:00.720 --> 19:01.720]  I apologize.
[19:01.720 --> 19:02.720]  I don't remember.
[19:02.720 --> 19:03.720]  Don't know.
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.720]  Don't recall who that was.
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.980]  Somebody will post a comment on the YouTube channel.
[19:06.980 --> 19:09.860]  Somebody will tell us who second place was, and then I'll give you an update on the next
[19:09.860 --> 19:10.860]  episode.
[19:11.260 --> 19:14.460]  First place was dialed in terpenes.
[19:14.460 --> 19:18.860]  If you guys have been watching the dude grows show podcast, dialed in terpenes was recently
[19:18.860 --> 19:20.660]  on that show.
[19:20.660 --> 19:24.700]  He was walking around the event with much confidence and there was a reason why, because
[19:24.700 --> 19:26.020]  his product crushed it.
[19:26.020 --> 19:27.020]  He took first place.
[19:27.020 --> 19:29.720]  He's got a dude grows concentration cup belt.
[19:29.720 --> 19:30.720]  So big shout out to everybody.
[19:30.720 --> 19:32.980]  I apologize again for not having the top three.
[19:32.980 --> 19:36.820]  I think that's the one real piece of constructive criticism we could put out there for the event
[19:36.820 --> 19:39.660]  is afterwards to a better job post in the winter.
[19:39.660 --> 19:40.660]  Yeah.
[19:41.460 --> 19:45.460]  And then that live also would have been another thing, but dude, um, there were so many dabs
[19:45.460 --> 19:50.220]  taken and so much cannabis consumed that, uh, we're lucky.
[19:50.220 --> 19:55.420]  We remember to do the award ceremony because people were stoned, bro.
[19:55.420 --> 19:56.420]  Yep.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.820]  It was, it was a stony event.
[19:57.820 --> 19:59.380]  I'm looking at the dude grows.
[19:59.380 --> 20:03.060]  I'm looking for the dude grows Instagram right now so that we can see.
[20:03.060 --> 20:04.060]  Yeah.
[20:04.060 --> 20:05.420]  They haven't posted any updates yet.
[20:05.420 --> 20:06.980]  So that would be my advice to them.
[20:06.980 --> 20:10.220]  All we ask for is some winners posted to social media and we'll be cool.
[20:10.780 --> 20:12.540]  I bet they'll say it on their podcast.
[20:12.540 --> 20:14.740]  Also, Hey, you guys make sure you support my friends.
[20:14.740 --> 20:15.740]  The dude grows podcast.
[20:15.740 --> 20:16.740]  They're good friends of mine.
[20:16.740 --> 20:19.300]  I feel a lot of people like you advertise another podcast.
[20:19.300 --> 20:20.300]  Fuck yeah, I do.
[20:20.300 --> 20:21.300]  Those are my friends.
[20:21.300 --> 20:22.300]  Make sure you support them.
[20:22.300 --> 20:23.940]  Big shout out to Scotty real big shout out to the dude.
[20:23.940 --> 20:27.580]  Also a big shout out to my buddy, the guru, uh, holding it down, keeping the show alive.
[20:27.580 --> 20:30.140]  Uh, and also all the warehouse crew, big shout out to everybody.
[20:30.140 --> 20:31.700]  They don't get enough love and attention.
[20:31.700 --> 20:34.260]  Uh, warehouse, Kyle, everybody out there working it.
[20:34.260 --> 20:37.660]  Uh, shout out, you know, everybody, uh, Jay Maestro, Jr.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.660]  Token.
[20:38.660 --> 20:39.660]  If I missed you, I'm sorry.
[20:39.660 --> 20:40.660]  I'm tapped out.
[20:40.660 --> 20:42.460]  Um, dude, the event was awesome.
[20:42.460 --> 20:44.460]  I feel like we covered most of the event.
[20:44.460 --> 20:47.300]  Uh, going live from the event was fun.
[20:47.300 --> 20:50.900]  Scotty real kept creeping up on me and he would ask me a silly question and I'd start
[20:50.900 --> 20:51.900]  to answer and go, be careful.
[20:51.900 --> 20:52.900]  We're on Instagram live.
[20:52.900 --> 20:55.140]  And I'd be like, oh shit, I was about to say something.
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.700]  I really don't want to say on Instagram live.
[20:56.700 --> 20:58.900]  Cause you just asked me a fucking awkward question.
[20:58.900 --> 21:01.020]  Uh, we spent a lot of time on Instagram live.
[21:01.020 --> 21:02.020]  That was a lot of fun.
[21:02.020 --> 21:07.460]  Granny's Instagram live goes so fast that her comments are just, you can't even read
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.260]  them.
[21:09.260 --> 21:10.260]  It's fucking crazy.
[21:10.260 --> 21:11.260]  I don't get that many.
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.260]  I'm not jealous at all.
[21:12.260 --> 21:23.220]  Um, so I guess the part now is to, um, first off, let's invite everybody to next year's
[21:23.220 --> 21:24.780]  concentration celebration.
[21:24.780 --> 21:26.420]  You follow the party.
[21:26.420 --> 21:27.420]  It was fun.
[21:27.420 --> 21:30.860]  Did you see on social media and look for their four 20 and seven 10 parties?
[21:30.860 --> 21:31.860]  That's right.
[21:31.860 --> 21:32.860]  Do that.
[21:32.860 --> 21:33.860]  Do that.
[21:33.860 --> 21:34.860]  Do that.
[21:34.860 --> 21:36.340]  Um, then we should give a shout out to all of our friends that supported us and invited
[21:36.340 --> 21:37.340]  us.
[21:38.220 --> 21:39.220]  I think I've got a list here.
[21:39.220 --> 21:40.220]  Did I do it right?
[21:40.220 --> 21:43.820]  Um, of course I owe a giant shout out to Scotty real Scotty without you.
[21:43.820 --> 21:45.900]  Yeah, dude, thank you.
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.540]  Without you, that event would, it would not have happened.
[21:47.540 --> 21:48.580]  That was your idea.
[21:48.580 --> 21:49.580]  You mentioned it.
[21:49.580 --> 21:52.900]  He mentioned it on the podcast one time and before he was done with the sentence on the
[21:52.900 --> 21:53.940]  show, I was texting him.
[21:53.940 --> 21:58.620]  If this doesn't happen, like you failed, like you mentioned it, it's got to happen manifest.
[21:58.620 --> 22:00.780]  I was like, I'll pay for a booth right now.
[22:00.780 --> 22:02.140]  And so we got that shit to happen.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.540]  So big shout out to Scotty real.
[22:03.540 --> 22:05.260]  Uh, Scotty does not work alone.
[22:05.260 --> 22:07.780]  He's got a nice team behind him.
[22:07.780 --> 22:12.540]  Team Scotty real team, DGC team, dude grows team recharge, uh, whatever you want to call
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.180]  him, call them.
[22:14.180 --> 22:15.180]  He's got a nice crew.
[22:15.180 --> 22:16.180]  So shout out to all of them.
[22:16.180 --> 22:17.220]  I don't know who all of them are.
[22:17.220 --> 22:18.220]  There was a Google document.
[22:18.220 --> 22:19.220]  It's a big team.
[22:19.220 --> 22:20.220]  Yeah.
[22:20.220 --> 22:23.580]  There was a Google doc in which a lot of people were participating and adding, uh, information
[22:23.580 --> 22:24.580]  to.
[22:24.580 --> 22:25.580]  So shout out to everybody on that Google doc.
[22:25.580 --> 22:26.580]  That was kind of fun.
[22:26.580 --> 22:31.680]  Uh, so I always shout out to Scotty also guru and the dude, uh, the entire DGC crew and
[22:31.680 --> 22:33.340]  all the people that work behind the scenes.
[22:33.340 --> 22:35.240]  They talk about the folks behind the scenes.
[22:36.220 --> 22:39.160]  Also big shout out to my friends at spectrum King.
[22:39.160 --> 22:40.160]  I owe them a shout out.
[22:40.160 --> 22:45.160]  I also, my friends at be nails, a shout out, big shout out to the, to Ali at be nails,
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.640]  much love, much respect for all the support.

[22:52.200 --> 22:54.480]  friends at mammoth P good folks there.
[22:54.480 --> 22:58.080]  Um, dude, aquaponics, Steve from potent Ponics.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.080]  We owe Steve a big shout out.
[22:59.080 --> 23:00.080]  He did a lot of work.
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.760]  Uh, he hung out at the booth a lot.
[23:01.760 --> 23:02.760]  Very cool kid.
[23:02.760 --> 23:03.760]  Big shout out.
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.240]  I love having granny without granny.
[23:05.240 --> 23:07.800]  That event would not have been as much fun.
[23:07.800 --> 23:09.320]  Granny is a fucking party on her own.
[23:09.320 --> 23:10.520]  I know I talk about it all the time.
[23:10.520 --> 23:15.320]  You guys, this lady is 63 years old and she will outsmoke and out dab you.
[23:15.320 --> 23:20.360]  I don't know who you are, but she will outsmoke and out dab you and she will laugh at you.
[23:20.360 --> 23:22.160]  She's got the heart of gold.
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.240]  She is the fucking funniest, sweetest lady that there is.
[23:25.240 --> 23:26.440]  She has such a good time.
[23:26.440 --> 23:28.720]  She's nothing but love and energy and good vibes.
[23:28.720 --> 23:30.720]  So having granny there was amazing.
[23:30.720 --> 23:31.920]  Fun dabbing with granny.
[23:31.920 --> 23:32.920]  Yes.
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.080]  I love the grumpy grandpa.
[23:34.080 --> 23:37.120]  Uh, Kevin wasn't so grumpy, so it was a lot of fun hanging out with him.
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.440]  He honestly got to meet grandpa.
[23:38.440 --> 23:40.040]  Yeah, he's a cool guy, ain't he?
[23:40.040 --> 23:42.080]  He's not super grumpy like he's made out to be.
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.480]  That's just his nickname, grumpy grandpa.
[23:43.480 --> 23:44.480]  We talked about guitars.
[23:44.480 --> 23:47.160]  Uh, we talked about granny a little bit when she wasn't looking.
[23:47.160 --> 23:48.320]  Uh, really cool dude.
[23:48.320 --> 23:49.400]  It's a big shout out to Kevin.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.320]  I hope we get to hang out more often at more events.
[23:51.320 --> 23:54.280]  I know sometimes he keeps to himself, but I'm going to get that old man talking to me
[23:54.280 --> 23:55.280]  more.
[23:55.280 --> 23:56.280]  He's a good dude.
[23:56.280 --> 23:57.280]  Uh, man, I want to give you a shout out.
[23:57.280 --> 23:58.280]  You fucking made it.
[23:58.280 --> 23:59.280]  I did.
[23:59.280 --> 24:00.280]  I finally made it to an event.
[24:01.240 --> 24:03.960]  And I was able to get out for several hours.
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.840]  It's not easy when there's a two hour drive on the either end of a three hour event.
[24:07.840 --> 24:11.640]  I dude, I was there from fucking three 30 to 1130.
[24:11.640 --> 24:12.640]  So I know, Jimmy, how were you?
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.640]  You left about the same time as me.
[24:13.640 --> 24:15.040]  Funny enough, Mike and I bumped into each other.
[24:15.040 --> 24:18.360]  We left and then reunited in the men's room at a gas station.
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.360]  Yeah.
[24:19.360 --> 24:25.240]  That sounds really awkward, but it wasn't in a, I was pissing and he walked up from
[24:25.240 --> 24:26.240]  behind me, goes, Hey hippie.
[24:26.240 --> 24:27.640]  And then he pissed at a separate stall.
[24:27.640 --> 24:28.640]  It was nothing weird.
[24:28.640 --> 24:29.920]  I got snacks, he got gas.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.560]  We got the fuck out.
[24:31.560 --> 24:33.560]  And that was like a good 30 miles outside of Denver too.
[24:33.560 --> 24:35.000]  Uh, so dude, thank you.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  I'm glad you made it.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  It was fun having you at the booth.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.600]  Uh, and it was fun when stabby realized that you were white Mike.
[24:40.600 --> 24:43.120]  He goes, I heard white Mike was coming and I go, you mean this guy?
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.320]  And he goes, Oh, and he was just like, people's faces were, were great.
[24:47.320 --> 24:50.960]  And then on social media, there's a great picture of you, me and Scotty going around
[24:50.960 --> 24:53.720]  in some of the comments underneath that have had me rolling all week.
[24:53.720 --> 24:54.720]  That's really funny.
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.520]  Scotty is not standing on a bench or a booster seat of any sort.
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.240]  And that photo, that is how tall Scotty really is.
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.880]  Mike's looking at me like, why the fuck you lying to everybody?
[25:06.880 --> 25:08.200]  Because they know I'm lying to them.
[25:08.200 --> 25:09.200]  It's funny.
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.200]  Somebody even pointed out just the angle it's taken makes you look like the shortest person
[25:13.200 --> 25:14.200]  there.
[25:14.200 --> 25:17.320]  And you're pretty upfront about the fact that you're like six, three, six, five.
[25:17.320 --> 25:18.480]  I am six, five.
[25:18.480 --> 25:19.680]  Mike's at least six, four.
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.160]  And then Scotty's got to be at least like a good four, 11, four, 11, five, three or
[25:24.160 --> 25:25.160]  something.
[25:25.160 --> 25:26.160]  No, I'm just fucking with you, Scotty.
[25:26.160 --> 25:27.160]  Nothing but love.
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.240]  It's Scottie's a normal size, three of magic though.
[25:29.240 --> 25:30.240]  Scottie's a normal size dude.
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.080]  But when he's standing next to us, it makes him shrink down to a normal person size.
[25:34.080 --> 25:36.040]  He gets all weird, but big shot at the Scotty.
[25:36.040 --> 25:37.040]  That is a great picture.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.800]  Um, let's see who else gets shot at.
[25:38.800 --> 25:42.000]  I'm just trying to run through these without sounding like a, some kind of award show or
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  something.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.560]  Um, Oh dude, I got to give a giant shout out to Amy without Amy, the iReed genetics booth
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.560]  wouldn't flow as smoothly as it does.
[25:49.560 --> 25:52.080]  People come and we do some, some business there.
[25:52.080 --> 25:53.920]  Uh, there are some shirts available.
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.560]  There are some iReed gifts available there.
[25:56.560 --> 25:57.560]  And people want to talk to me.
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.600]  Like we talked about earlier and I want to talk to people and sometimes four and five,
[26:01.600 --> 26:04.200]  maybe six, 22 people want to talk to me at a time.
[26:04.200 --> 26:08.400]  And Amy is able to say that guy right there wanted a shirt and she'll grab the shirt and
[26:08.400 --> 26:11.640]  she'll hear what size and what color shirt and she'll have it out before I could say,
[26:11.640 --> 26:12.960]  what size and color did you need, bro?
[26:12.960 --> 26:14.520]  And they'll say a black extra large.
[26:14.520 --> 26:15.520]  And she'd like, here it is.
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.120]  And she'll tap me on the shoulder with the shirt.
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.080]  No, I, you guys had a beautiful little system going.
[26:20.080 --> 26:21.080]  I was impressed.
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.800]  Well, yeah, without her, it wouldn't happen that way.
[26:22.840 --> 26:24.640]  It would be me stoned stumbling through.
[26:24.640 --> 26:26.640]  So what'd you want again, bro?
[26:26.640 --> 26:26.920]  Yeah.
[26:26.920 --> 26:27.200]  Yeah.
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.200]  So big shout out to Amy.
[26:28.200 --> 26:30.040]  Uh, I would have fucked up a lot of things without her.
[26:30.040 --> 26:32.600]  She alphabetized all of the products that we carry.
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.240]  Uh, she keeps a lot of things in line.
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.080]  She does a really good job.
[26:35.080 --> 26:36.080]  So big shout out to her.
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.360]  It wouldn't happen without her.
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.400]  Um, here's where it gets fun.
[26:39.400 --> 26:41.520]  Big shout out to my buddy, Stabby McStabwood.
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.320]  That dude traveled a long, long way.
[26:43.320 --> 26:44.720]  He drove several minutes of hours.
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.160]  Uh, so yeah, it was a good time to hang out with him again.
[26:47.160 --> 26:48.440]  That's the second or maybe third time.
[26:48.440 --> 26:49.680]  Second time I got to hang out with him.
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.000]  I'll see you Thursday on the embracing organics show.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.000]  Cannot wait.
[26:54.320 --> 26:55.800]  Uh, for giving a shout out to Stabby.
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.520]  So I said, Stabby has weird.
[26:57.640 --> 26:59.040]  We've got to give a shout out to Stoney.
[26:59.040 --> 27:00.360]  Big shout out to Stoney scholar.
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.440]  Um, also an anonymous friend gave me a really cool gift of a really cool pipe.
[27:05.760 --> 27:07.560]  Uh, man, that fucking pipe is cool.
[27:07.560 --> 27:10.880]  It's a green and blue and it's got some yellows and it's got some UV working.
[27:10.880 --> 27:12.520]  It's a Sherlock shout out.
[27:12.520 --> 27:13.360]  Thank you for the pipe.
[27:13.360 --> 27:14.200]  That is really cool.
[27:14.440 --> 27:16.040]  Also shout out to Tenasi.
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.520]  Uh, always good to see Tenasi and his lovely lady, lovely lady at the event.
[27:20.520 --> 27:22.080]  That was harder to say than it should have been.
[27:22.520 --> 27:24.040]  Uh, who else do we need to shout out for?
[27:24.640 --> 27:26.640]  We've got to give a huge shout out to cultivated synergy.
[27:26.880 --> 27:29.320]  Oh, and I always shout out to, uh, Jay bro.
[27:29.320 --> 27:31.360]  Jay bro brought me yet another gift.
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.120]  That man's brings the fucking greatest gifts.
[27:34.360 --> 27:35.240]  So thank you, brother.
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.480]  I hope you hear this, uh, big shout out from one dead head to another.
[27:38.680 --> 27:40.360]  Uh, Hey now, I appreciate that.
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.040]  But back to cultivated synergy.
[27:42.240 --> 27:43.360]  Cultivated synergy.
[27:43.480 --> 27:48.480]  That's honestly, if the, if the event gets 30% more popular, 30% more attendance,
[27:52.440 --> 27:53.280]  it's not going to fit.
[27:53.840 --> 27:58.320]  I think the max capacity with the part, there's more of the venue we can open.
[27:58.760 --> 27:59.800]  We didn't open the whole place.
[27:59.800 --> 28:01.200]  There are parts that were sealed off.
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.600]  But it's a great little space.
[28:02.640 --> 28:02.840]  Yeah.
[28:02.840 --> 28:06.080]  If you can pay for more of the building, we didn't pay for more of it, apparently,
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.200]  which was fine.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.480]  We wanted to keep it right around where we did.
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.080]  Uh, I think that section of the building, I think there were
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.240]  300 approximately in that area.
[28:15.280 --> 28:18.240]  It can hold three 50 before we have to open more of the building.
[28:18.440 --> 28:21.560]  So when it was, it was comfortable to, it wasn't overcrowded.
[28:21.560 --> 28:22.560]  It wasn't hot.
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.680]  There was a space to move around.
[28:24.680 --> 28:27.720]  There was space to set your stuff down for a minute and sit down and drink some
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.560]  water.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.040]  Um, it's set up, it kind of looks like it'd be a spot for like an obnoxious
[28:35.040 --> 28:35.960]  corporate meeting.
[28:36.600 --> 28:36.880]  They do.
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.160]  There's a kitchen there where you could like legit make a full meal.
[28:41.160 --> 28:45.080]  All the kitchen implements were there to use a dishwasher fridge.
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.800]  Um, the whole getup, there's like a living room space with a bunch of comfy
[28:50.800 --> 28:52.960]  chairs and couches and some tables.
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.000]  And then there was like just open space with a nice floor for all the booth
[28:57.000 --> 28:57.440]  tables.
[28:57.440 --> 28:58.720]  It was a really nice spot for this.
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.880]  We should mention the gorgeous artwork on the walls as well.
[29:01.920 --> 29:02.880]  Beautiful artwork.
[29:02.920 --> 29:04.320]  Well, well-maintained artwork.
[29:04.320 --> 29:07.520]  One thing I was going to say, when you said they could host boring, obnoxious
[29:07.520 --> 29:08.680]  meetings there, they do that.
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.280]  Uh, that place holds events like a couple of weeks ago, maybe a week ago,
[29:12.280 --> 29:13.120]  no, it was two weeks ago.
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.880]  They had the home growers cup, which was the same type of event.
[29:15.880 --> 29:19.800]  Like we had then the weekend after that it was the Colorado department of
[29:19.800 --> 29:25.040]  agriculture and MED, uh, sort of a symposium of some sort where there was
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.640]  absolutely no consumption.
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.920]  That's where the suits and all the tide folks were hanging out.
[29:29.240 --> 29:30.840]  And then the next week they've got us back.
[29:31.920 --> 29:32.280]  Right.
[29:32.280 --> 29:34.640]  Well, that's also, they do bud tender nights there.
[29:34.640 --> 29:36.360]  They do a industry night there.
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.120]  They'll do Cincy night there quite often.
[29:38.120 --> 29:39.080]  So it's a really cool place.
[29:39.080 --> 29:40.880]  A really, really nice space.
[29:42.160 --> 29:44.000]  I was immediately impressed with the venue.
[29:44.640 --> 29:44.920]  Yeah.
[29:45.080 --> 29:48.520]  There's a young lady there whose name I do not know, uh, who does a really good
[29:48.520 --> 29:52.440]  job when we get there, she frantically runs around and she's like, what do you
[29:52.440 --> 29:52.720]  need?
[29:53.160 --> 29:55.160]  Like, and that's what, what do you need?
[29:55.160 --> 29:55.680]  That's her quiet.
[29:55.680 --> 29:57.880]  And sometimes that's all you need is somebody to go, Hey, what do you need?
[29:58.120 --> 30:01.200]  Even if you don't need anything for someone to go, what do you need?
[30:01.240 --> 30:03.720]  You go, shit, we're taken care of, but thank you.
[30:03.720 --> 30:05.400]  I needed to know I was taken care of.
[30:05.400 --> 30:05.600]  Yeah.
[30:05.600 --> 30:06.040]  I know.
[30:06.080 --> 30:06.280]  Yep.
[30:06.320 --> 30:09.000]  I need to know who to talk to when shit does go wrong and you're the person I'm
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.840]  going to need when I need that window closed because or opened or whatever.
[30:11.840 --> 30:12.640]  Now I know who to find.
[30:12.640 --> 30:13.040]  Thank you.
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.080]  But yeah, she, she runs around and asks, asks, what do you need?
[30:16.080 --> 30:19.720]  If you need an extension cord or more tables or a table cloth or whatever,
[30:19.720 --> 30:20.520]  she's got you covered.
[30:20.520 --> 30:21.680]  So that's always nice.
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.600]  So big shout out to our friends at cultivated synergy.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.520]  Uh, man, we've just been ranting, giving people shout outs.
[30:26.600 --> 30:32.920]  It's, it was so nice to go to, to a good and smoothly functioning consumption
[30:33.920 --> 30:39.120]  um, a couple of the others that I've managed to make it to over the years.
[30:40.040 --> 30:42.880]  There's always some just like, why is this happening?
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.760]  Well, there was another five minutes of thought two days ago, solves this
[30:46.760 --> 30:48.800]  headache for the 300 people that are here.
[30:48.800 --> 30:49.560]  Like, come on now.
[30:49.640 --> 30:52.280]  There was any parallel job.
[30:52.320 --> 30:52.560]  Yeah.
[30:52.560 --> 30:57.120]  There was an event that happened right next in our hometown that we drove
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.720]  108 miles away from, um, to go to a better one.
[31:01.120 --> 31:03.520]  But that event I heard was a complete shit show.
[31:03.560 --> 31:06.880]  So I'm glad that we went to the event, which we chose to support
[31:06.880 --> 31:08.400]  to a reputable event folks.
[31:08.400 --> 31:08.800]  Yes.
[31:08.800 --> 31:09.240]  Yes.
[31:09.640 --> 31:10.000]  All right, Mike.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.320]  It sounds like we've been shouting out the dude grows.
[31:12.720 --> 31:15.880]  Concentration celebration event for quite enough time.
[31:15.880 --> 31:17.720]  We've given them 30 good solid minutes.
[31:18.480 --> 31:20.760]  There are a lot of people who I did not give a shout out.
[31:20.760 --> 31:23.760]  A lot of people, uh, Dray McFly, you get a shout out.
[31:25.440 --> 31:29.480]  If I wanted to list off everybody who I high five, we'd have another half hour
[31:29.640 --> 31:29.920]  yeah.
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.200]  Jeremy and Cheryl and cannabis clarity and her lovely partner in crime.
[31:34.760 --> 31:36.440]  Uh, ogre's organics gets a shout out.
[31:36.440 --> 31:38.720]  I don't know if they were at the event, but they definitely get a shout out.
[31:40.200 --> 31:43.280]  Everybody, everybody was fucking there and they all should get a shout out, but
[31:43.280 --> 31:45.960]  I can't cover all of you because then I'll forget somebody and I'll feel bad.
[31:46.360 --> 31:50.280]  Um, but I want to thank everybody for showing up for hanging out.
[31:50.280 --> 31:51.520]  Everybody that visited the booth.
[31:51.520 --> 31:52.440]  That was fucking cool.
[31:52.720 --> 31:56.400]  Uh, there was a lovely couple whose names are eluding me right now.
[31:56.560 --> 32:00.680]  I don't want to say that little tiny cute girl, the normal size tall dude, but that
[32:00.680 --> 32:03.920]  little tiny cute girl, that normal size dude, uh, they're really nice.
[32:03.920 --> 32:04.560]  They're really kind.
[32:04.560 --> 32:05.760]  They always make sure to come say hi.
[32:06.080 --> 32:06.840]  I'm highest shit.
[32:06.840 --> 32:08.640]  And at events, I cannot think of anybody's name.
[32:08.640 --> 32:11.040]  Their names are leaving my head, but you guys get a special shout out.
[32:11.040 --> 32:13.400]  Cause you make sure to come say hi every time you're super kind.
[32:13.400 --> 32:14.720]  And I appreciate that sort of shit.
[32:14.960 --> 32:15.560]  You know who you are.
[32:15.560 --> 32:18.480]  And I'm sorry that I identify you as that little tiny chick with the orange
[32:18.480 --> 32:20.280]  shoes, but you totally know who you are now.
[32:20.640 --> 32:21.640]  Uh, you guys are super cool.
[32:21.840 --> 32:22.800]  I was looking forward to seeing you.
[32:23.200 --> 32:25.680]  Um, dude, I think that's all we've got.
[32:25.680 --> 32:28.280]  Mike, you got any shit to say for the end of this podcast here?
[32:28.520 --> 32:30.640]  I'll just be kind to each other.
[32:30.640 --> 32:31.200]  Stay good.
[32:31.200 --> 32:32.040]  And we'll see you in a week.
[32:32.480 --> 32:33.760]  That sounds about right.
[32:33.760 --> 32:36.840]  We should just press end right there, but we're not, we're going to go like this.
[32:37.840 --> 32:38.480]  Thanks for hanging out.
[32:38.480 --> 32:39.880]  I did have a lot of fun in this episode.
[32:39.880 --> 32:41.400]  Mike, it was good having you back, dude.
[32:41.440 --> 32:42.040]  Oh yeah, man.
[32:42.680 --> 32:43.560]  Oh, we got to get you on here.
[32:43.560 --> 32:45.680]  It was good getting me out and it was good being back on the show.
[32:45.720 --> 32:47.480]  Dude, you got out of the house twice this.
[32:47.480 --> 32:51.720]  I, uh, I've got a couple of shows that, uh, I want to come over record.
[32:51.960 --> 32:53.480]  So I've got some ideas.
[32:53.480 --> 32:55.520]  There's some stuff in the works.
[32:55.520 --> 32:56.800]  We're going to try to get me on some more.
[32:57.120 --> 33:00.400]  If you think that's a good or a bad idea, feel free to send me a message at
[33:00.400 --> 33:04.480]  Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or Pablo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[33:04.560 --> 33:07.640]  And a lot of people on the Instagram live feeds ask for more of you.
[33:08.040 --> 33:09.080]  This is so funny.
[33:09.080 --> 33:15.600]  As soon as, uh, I think it was halfway home from the cup and the DGC social
[33:15.600 --> 33:19.000]  media posted that picture of the three of us that I started getting, um,
[33:19.240 --> 33:20.680]  follow requests on Instagram.
[33:20.680 --> 33:22.520]  And I'm like, I don't Graham people.
[33:22.600 --> 33:22.840]  Yeah.
[33:22.840 --> 33:25.640]  He doesn't Instagram very much, but I do enough for both of us.
[33:25.680 --> 33:28.360]  You will not be very amused with my Instagram.
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.840]  Uh, but you can follow my Instagram.
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.560]  It's I re underscore genetics.
[33:33.920 --> 33:35.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, do that.
[33:35.560 --> 33:36.000]  It's great.
[33:36.040 --> 33:38.880]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[33:39.160 --> 33:41.480]  I'm going to cover some more listener emails on Monday.
[33:41.480 --> 33:44.080]  So if you've sent me an email with a cannabis growing question, and you've
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.960]  been wondering if I'm ever going to read it, the answer is yes.
[33:47.160 --> 33:48.600]  I've got a giant stack of emails.
[33:48.800 --> 33:51.880]  Maybe yours is in the pile that comes up on the Monday episode.
[33:52.320 --> 33:54.800]  If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or
[33:54.800 --> 33:58.280]  entertaining, and you'd like to support the show financially, you can do so
