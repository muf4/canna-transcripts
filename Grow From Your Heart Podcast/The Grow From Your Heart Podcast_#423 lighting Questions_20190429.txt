[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  Hey, what's up, smokers and growers?
[00:01.880 --> 00:06.000]  It is time for episode 423 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.560]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.560 --> 00:13.520]  It is time to add fresh new genetics to your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon Elite
[00:13.520 --> 00:20.240]  Seeds, and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.240 --> 00:24.160]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.880]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Mai Tai live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:28.880 --> 00:31.880]  This is a blend of Sunset Sherb and Purple Punch.
[00:31.880 --> 00:35.600]  The flavor description on the container says it should taste like tropical fruit cocktail.
[00:35.600 --> 00:37.660]  I would say that is accurate.
[00:37.660 --> 00:44.600]  The potency label says 69.27% total THC and 0% CBD.
[00:44.600 --> 00:49.680]  When I crack this open, I start thinking that I don't know if I know what a Mai Tai really
[00:49.680 --> 00:50.680]  smells like.
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.640]  That is not a familiar aroma for me, but as I give this a sniff, it smells like a Long
[00:55.640 --> 00:57.280]  Island iced tea.
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.600]  It's got a tropical aroma.
[00:58.600 --> 01:03.320]  It has got a very pungent aroma, but that maybe a triple sec sort of a thing definitely
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.240]  dominates the smell of the Mai Tai.
[01:05.240 --> 01:06.360]  It is delicious.
[01:06.360 --> 01:09.880]  It is obviously quite potent because it has got me talking my face off.
[01:09.880 --> 01:12.040]  This is great podcast concentrate.
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.240]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the Mai Tai live batter.
[01:17.240 --> 01:21.220]  I want to thank everybody for listening to that short episode I put out on Thursday with
[01:21.220 --> 01:23.520]  all of the content I made before 420.
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.640]  I just needed a little bit of a podcasting break, so I threw out a short episode for
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.640]  Thursday.
[01:28.640 --> 01:31.200]  Here we are Monday with a full length episode.
[01:31.200 --> 01:32.680]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:32.680 --> 01:35.960]  I'm going to read more listener emails in this episode.
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.480]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs for our friends on Patreon.
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.800]  I always want to give a big shout out to Miss Melville.
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.000]  I owe a giant shout out to my friend Tanner M. I want to send a huge Grow From Your Heart
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.640]  podcast shout out to my friend Farmer John.
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.520]  How about a big giant shout out to my friend Dick Goals?
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.400]  Of course, always a shout out to Todd K. Of course, a big shout out to my friend Aldridge.
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.960]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast fist bump to my friend Remy Red Eye.
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.360]  I want to thank each and every one of you for your support on Patreon.
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.960]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[02:10.960 --> 02:12.700]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:12.700 --> 02:16.800]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[02:16.800 --> 02:20.480]  Once again, I want to thank everybody for all of the Patreon contributions, everybody
[02:20.520 --> 02:23.360]  who has helped out in the past, in the present, and in the future.
[02:23.360 --> 02:25.960]  Your support really does mean a lot to me.
[02:25.960 --> 02:26.960]  Thank you.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.200]  Now I know I said I was going to read some listener emails.
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.920]  Before we get there, I've got one more thing I would like to cover.
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.460]  Several episodes back, before 420, I started asking people to send in submissions and let
[02:37.460 --> 02:39.800]  me know what 420 means to you.
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.800]  I got a lot of great submissions.
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.120]  Of course, many of you are cannabis consumers, which means that 420 came and passed you up.
[02:47.120 --> 02:48.880]  You didn't even realize it was 420.
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.040]  A lot of you messaged me on 420 or right after.
[02:52.040 --> 02:56.160]  Here is a submission I received on the afternoon of 420.
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.120]  This is what 420 means to a friend of the podcast.
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.320]  This one goes like this.
[03:01.320 --> 03:05.960]  When I see or hear 420, I smile and I say, thank you for saving my life.
[03:05.960 --> 03:10.940]  I am in constant pain from a pinched nerve in my neck and three screwed up lower back
[03:10.940 --> 03:17.600]  discs, plus a 15 millimeter by 22 millimeter crack in my left knee socket.
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.400]  I had enough and wanted to get just high for the fun of it and hoped it would get
[03:22.400 --> 03:24.320]  me numb.
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.400]  I was getting ready to leave and I'd started giving my shit away to all my peoples.
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.600]  I was done with all of my pains and being angry all the time and I was stressed out.
[03:32.600 --> 03:33.600]  I was overweight.
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.000]  I was at 365 pounds.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.920]  You know, I was mentally and emotionally checking out.
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.800]  Then I asked my bud tender what was good for pain, sleep, or just help with stress.
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.680]  I thought the 18 year old kid would recommend something that was just strong as hell, lots
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.360]  of THC, and that would get me high as hell.
[03:51.360 --> 03:57.000]  I thought that's what everyone was talking about when they said cannabis helped them,
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.440]  that they were just getting high as a kite.
[03:59.440 --> 04:05.040]  So the kid says something like, try Romulan or sleep pain for sleeper pain or Jack the
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.360]  Ripper for daytime pain or OG Kush and so on.
[04:08.360 --> 04:09.360]  So I get home.
[04:09.360 --> 04:13.700]  It's close to bedtime, so Romulan slept great first time since 1997.
[04:13.700 --> 04:16.260]  So cannabis helped this guy sleep for the first time since 97.
[04:16.260 --> 04:18.340]  He goes, it is 2019.
[04:18.340 --> 04:21.860]  How would you feel if you hadn't had a nap since fucking 1997?
[04:21.860 --> 04:25.380]  Some of you say I've been up for two days or I didn't get any sleep last night.
[04:25.380 --> 04:28.020]  This dude said he's been up since 97.
[04:28.020 --> 04:31.620]  So our friend smoked a little bit of Romulan on the recommendation of a bud tender and
[04:31.620 --> 04:36.340]  he got his first good night's sleep since 1997.
[04:36.340 --> 04:38.700]  He goes on to say, then I tried OG Kush.
[04:38.700 --> 04:40.940]  That's when I got this stuff that really works.
[04:40.940 --> 04:45.780]  So I put the brakes on all that checking out bullshit and started growing and I haven't
[04:45.780 --> 04:52.300]  looked back at those dark days until you asked me, what does 420 mean to me?
[04:52.300 --> 04:55.600]  So in short, it sounds like this guy was done with life.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.860]  He was looking to possibly take his own life in the very near future if he hadn't discovered
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.860]  the proper strains of cannabis.
[05:02.860 --> 05:07.900]  His pain, his discomfort, his attitude, his health, his weight, everything was stacking
[05:07.900 --> 05:09.420]  up to where he was done.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.900]  He had emotionally checked out.
[05:10.900 --> 05:12.580]  He had checked out of his friends and family.
[05:12.580 --> 05:14.140]  It sounds like he was giving a shit away.
[05:14.140 --> 05:17.740]  When you get to that point, you were close to doing something ridiculous that you can't
[05:17.740 --> 05:18.740]  stop.
[05:18.740 --> 05:19.740]  You can't undo.
[05:19.740 --> 05:21.240]  He was about to get there.
[05:21.240 --> 05:25.740]  He smoked the appropriate strain of cannabis based on a bud tender's recommendation and
[05:25.740 --> 05:27.340]  he finally got some sleep.
[05:27.340 --> 05:28.820]  Imagine getting some sleep since 1997.
[05:28.820 --> 05:30.720]  You're going to be tired.
[05:30.720 --> 05:31.720]  You finally get some rest.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.720]  It's going to change your life.
[05:32.720 --> 05:34.260]  You're going to start being nicer to people.
[05:34.260 --> 05:35.340]  Your attitude's going to change.
[05:35.340 --> 05:37.620]  When you're nicer to people, they're nicer back.
[05:37.620 --> 05:38.960]  That has a lot to do with your health.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.280]  It has a lot to do with your mental health and my opinion will play a lot with how your
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.680]  body feels.
[05:42.680 --> 05:46.440]  Our friend consumed some cannabis and basically it saved his life.
[05:46.440 --> 05:47.760]  Now he is one of us.
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.640]  Now he is a grower, he's a smoker, and he is an advocate.
[05:50.640 --> 05:52.020]  I know who this person is.
[05:52.020 --> 05:54.080]  He does contribute to the podcast heavily.
[05:54.080 --> 05:56.160]  He gets a shout out on a lot of episodes.
[05:56.160 --> 05:59.440]  He actually says his name here in the future in the message, so we are going to give him
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.380]  a shout out here on this.
[06:01.380 --> 06:03.380]  Cannabis has turned this person's life around.
[06:03.380 --> 06:06.380]  He smoked just for the hell of it because he was at wit's end.
[06:06.380 --> 06:07.380]  What else was going to happen?
[06:07.380 --> 06:08.380]  Is it going to go bad?
[06:08.800 --> 06:09.800]  Is it going to get worse?
[06:09.800 --> 06:10.800]  He was already at the breaking point.
[06:10.800 --> 06:11.800]  He smoked a little reefer.
[06:11.800 --> 06:12.800]  It made him feel good.
[06:12.800 --> 06:14.300]  It gave him some sleep.
[06:14.300 --> 06:17.380]  He got to break free from his pain, from his suffering.
[06:17.380 --> 06:18.500]  Now he is enjoying life.
[06:18.500 --> 06:19.500]  Now he's one of us.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.500]  Also, he's part of the Irie Army.
[06:20.500 --> 06:22.300]  I want to continue with the message here.
[06:22.300 --> 06:26.780]  He goes on to say, thank you so damn much for all you do for the 420 community.
[06:26.780 --> 06:29.660]  Much love to you, Rasta Jeff and the Irie Army.
[06:29.660 --> 06:32.540]  Hey, thank you for this great message.
[06:32.540 --> 06:37.220]  Messages like this, I know I didn't have anything to do with your starting of consumption, but
[06:37.220 --> 06:41.820]  knowing that I'm part of this movement, that I'm helping people with their cannabis, just
[06:41.820 --> 06:45.920]  being a part of this and being able to read these types of stories on my little show here,
[06:45.920 --> 06:46.920]  that means a lot to me.
[06:46.920 --> 06:49.420]  Other people are going to hear this and they're going to say, man, this guy was at wit's end
[06:49.420 --> 06:51.380]  and cannabis kind of turned him around.
[06:51.380 --> 06:56.500]  Maybe that story alone will change somebody else's perspective on cannabis.
[06:56.500 --> 06:57.500]  Thank you, man.
[06:57.500 --> 06:58.580]  Thank you for being a part of the community.
[06:58.580 --> 07:00.700]  Thank you for supporting myself and the show so much.
[07:00.700 --> 07:02.600]  You have been a big part of the Irie Army.
[07:02.600 --> 07:05.160]  You are part of the Irie Army as well.
[07:05.160 --> 07:06.620]  Thank you, man.
[07:06.620 --> 07:07.620]  It's reciprocated.
[07:07.620 --> 07:08.860]  It goes back and forth.
[07:08.860 --> 07:12.420]  Without a listener, a guy doing a podcast is just a weirdo with a microphone.
[07:12.420 --> 07:14.100]  So I need a good solid audience.
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.140]  You guys have a good show.
[07:15.140 --> 07:16.220]  It works well for both of us.
[07:16.220 --> 07:17.220]  So thank you.
[07:17.220 --> 07:19.940]  He goes on to mention his social media handles.
[07:19.940 --> 07:23.740]  He also talks about some other things here that we don't need to share on the show.
[07:23.740 --> 07:25.900]  He says, thanks for the shout outs every time.
[07:25.900 --> 07:27.660]  It feels so damn good.
[07:27.660 --> 07:29.460]  And then he said, sorry for this long ass email.
[07:29.460 --> 07:33.020]  I'm an old fart grower and all of this is new to me.
[07:33.020 --> 07:35.220]  And then he gives me, it looks like a cloud emoji.
[07:35.220 --> 07:36.500]  I can't read what that emoji is.
[07:36.500 --> 07:38.180]  My computer printed it out kind of oddly.
[07:38.180 --> 07:39.180]  And then a fist bump.
[07:39.180 --> 07:41.660]  So big shout out for the fist bump right there.
[07:41.660 --> 07:45.940]  And that is from our friend Richard Memel, also known as 420grampsys.
[07:45.940 --> 07:48.620]  So hey, Richard, thank you for the great email.
[07:48.620 --> 07:51.100]  Thank you for telling me what 420 means to you.
[07:51.100 --> 07:52.100]  That means a lot to me.
[07:52.100 --> 07:53.380]  That is a very moving story.
[07:53.380 --> 07:56.420]  I hope that changes somebody's outlook on cannabis.
[07:56.420 --> 07:59.460]  And dude, that was kind of brave for you to go out and share something like that.
[07:59.460 --> 08:02.740]  That is kind of opening up to the whole world here, to the whole cannabis community, especially
[08:02.740 --> 08:03.740]  to myself.
[08:03.740 --> 08:04.740]  So thank you, dude.
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.020]  I appreciate your bravery and I appreciate this great message.
[08:08.020 --> 08:09.740]  Thanks for telling me what 420 means to you.
[08:09.740 --> 08:11.420]  It is not too late, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:11.420 --> 08:15.460]  I know I asked several episodes ago, what does 420 mean to you?
[08:15.460 --> 08:16.460]  It is not too late.
[08:16.460 --> 08:17.460]  Send me your responses.
[08:17.460 --> 08:20.460]  You can email them to me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:20.460 --> 08:24.500]  Or if it is short, you can send it to me on Twitter, at GFYH podcast.
[08:24.500 --> 08:26.300]  I'll do my best to find them all.
[08:26.300 --> 08:28.820]  And I will read your submission on the show.
[08:28.820 --> 08:30.480]  What does 420 mean to you?
[08:30.480 --> 08:31.820]  And somebody said, do you mean the number?
[08:31.820 --> 08:32.820]  Do you mean the time?
[08:32.820 --> 08:33.820]  Do you mean the date?
[08:33.900 --> 08:34.900]  I don't know.
[08:34.900 --> 08:35.900]  What do you mean?
[08:35.900 --> 08:38.420]  When I say 420, what does it mean to you?
[08:38.420 --> 08:39.420]  All right.
[08:39.420 --> 08:42.140]  Now let's get into those emails that I keep talking about.
[08:42.140 --> 08:44.820]  I've got one right here at the top of the pile.
[08:44.820 --> 08:46.300]  This one, let's see, it says, no names.
[08:46.300 --> 08:47.860]  I am in prohibition land.
[08:47.860 --> 08:49.020]  That makes it easy.
[08:49.020 --> 08:50.020]  So let's get right into it.
[08:50.020 --> 08:53.460]  It says, Rasta Jeff, please don't say my name because I am in prohibition land.
[08:53.460 --> 08:56.140]  I do have an indoor garden going.
[08:56.140 --> 08:57.500]  First grow all auto flowers.
[08:57.500 --> 09:01.260]  I'm doing a 20 on and four hour off light schedule.
[09:01.260 --> 09:05.340]  Some of my plants are already a couple of weeks into flower and some have just started.
[09:05.340 --> 09:08.820]  They were all seeded the same week, but there are three different strains.
[09:08.820 --> 09:10.540]  So they are going at different rates.
[09:10.540 --> 09:12.500]  Yes, that makes sense so far.
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.500]  They're from seed.
[09:13.500 --> 09:14.500]  They're from auto flowers.
[09:14.500 --> 09:15.500]  They're different strains.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.980]  They were bred from different genetics.
[09:16.980 --> 09:18.780]  So they are going to have different traits.
[09:18.780 --> 09:20.300]  They will have different flowering times.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.380]  They'll start at different times.
[09:21.380 --> 09:22.820]  They'll finish at different times.
[09:22.820 --> 09:24.380]  But variety is the spice of life.
[09:24.380 --> 09:26.820]  We talked about why in a previous episode.
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.820]  Let's keep moving forward.
[09:27.820 --> 09:32.260]  He says, the weather where I live has gotten really nice and I want to move my plants to
[09:32.260 --> 09:36.940]  my back deck for a few hours each day for their light cycle when it's nice.
[09:36.940 --> 09:41.340]  Is there anything I should know about moving them in and out as far as temps and humidity?
[09:41.340 --> 09:45.660]  Also, should I gradually let them adjust to the sunlight or is it okay to stick them out
[09:45.660 --> 09:49.340]  there for 12 to 13 hours of daylight in a row?
[09:49.340 --> 09:52.780]  He wraps up and he says, I'm a disabled veteran and I'm growing my own medicine.
[09:52.780 --> 09:55.580]  It really helps with my anxiety and PTSD.
[09:56.140 --> 09:57.700]  Hey, thank you for your service.
[09:57.700 --> 10:03.460]  And I am saddened that you have got PTSD, but I am happy to hear that you have found
[10:03.460 --> 10:07.660]  medicine that works for you because I know that PTSD can be really torturous.
[10:07.660 --> 10:10.140]  So I'm glad you've got something helping you with that.
[10:10.140 --> 10:11.380]  Now let's get into this question.
[10:11.380 --> 10:15.620]  He said, the weather has gotten really nice and I want to move my plants to my back deck
[10:15.620 --> 10:17.340]  for a few hours.
[10:17.340 --> 10:19.500]  In theory, that sounds like a really great option.
[10:19.500 --> 10:21.200]  Those plants would love some sunlight.
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.660]  That sunlight would be really good for them.
[10:22.660 --> 10:23.740]  It is also free.
[10:23.740 --> 10:26.100]  They're probably also going to love that outdoor air.
[10:26.100 --> 10:28.380]  It is going to be beautiful for them.
[10:28.380 --> 10:32.980]  However, my biggest fear is that you were going to bring bugs into the grow room when
[10:32.980 --> 10:34.660]  you bring the plants back in.
[10:34.660 --> 10:40.020]  No matter how careful you are, no matter what you do, I would be very afraid that I would
[10:40.020 --> 10:43.740]  bring bugs from that outside environment into my grow room.
[10:43.740 --> 10:45.580]  We spend a lot of time building a grow room.
[10:45.580 --> 10:49.540]  We put a lot of effort into there and to kind of keeping it isolated to take those plants
[10:49.540 --> 10:51.020]  right outside.
[10:51.020 --> 10:55.220]  That is kind of against everything that I would do in my grow environment.
[10:55.220 --> 10:57.380]  You probably play by your own rules.
[10:57.380 --> 11:00.300]  That's why you're a cannabis grower and a cannabis consumer.
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.860]  I would not take these plants outside because you may likely bring bugs in when you bring
[11:04.860 --> 11:06.500]  them back in.
[11:06.500 --> 11:08.300]  Bugs can fly and land on them.
[11:08.300 --> 11:10.700]  Bugs can climb up the pot and get right into the dirt.
[11:10.700 --> 11:14.020]  Bugs will climb up into the dirt, then climb up the stick and hide under the leaves.
[11:14.020 --> 11:16.820]  Also, I had another friend who listens to this podcast.
[11:16.820 --> 11:18.980]  He was having an issue with his plants.
[11:18.980 --> 11:20.500]  We couldn't figure out what it was.
[11:20.500 --> 11:22.900]  One day he told me, well, when I took them outside, they looked fine.
[11:22.900 --> 11:24.060]  I've been bringing them back in.
[11:24.060 --> 11:27.700]  I realized he had some sort of soil-borne pest.
[11:27.700 --> 11:32.260]  Something burrowed from the bottom of his pot up into the root zone, up into the soil.
[11:32.260 --> 11:34.840]  It infested the entire root zone of his plants.
[11:34.840 --> 11:37.180]  It took him a long time to recover from that one.
[11:37.180 --> 11:39.540]  I would not suggest taking them outside.
[11:39.540 --> 11:40.940]  You've got bugs out there.
[11:40.940 --> 11:43.460]  Also, maybe possibly you've got neighbors out there.
[11:43.460 --> 11:45.020]  I don't know your living situation.
[11:45.020 --> 11:46.020]  I don't know your neighborhood.
[11:46.020 --> 11:47.580]  Maybe you're out in the middle of nowhere.
[11:47.580 --> 11:50.480]  However, I don't want anybody to see those plants.
[11:50.480 --> 11:51.820]  You said you're a disabled veteran.
[11:51.820 --> 11:55.920]  If somebody sees them, people are thieves, people are shitty.
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.060]  Somebody might call the cops.
[11:57.060 --> 11:58.060]  Be very careful.
[11:58.060 --> 11:59.060]  I wouldn't put them out there.
[11:59.060 --> 12:03.200]  You say Prohibition Land and plants outside, that is another big red flag for me.
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.620]  I would not do that.
[12:04.620 --> 12:05.620]  Don't snitch on yourself.
[12:05.620 --> 12:06.920]  There could be a helicopter.
[12:06.920 --> 12:10.680]  There could be a fucking Girl Scout cookie sales girl coming by to sell you some Girl
[12:10.680 --> 12:13.160]  Scout cookies and see your weed plant out on the back deck.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.800]  Again, I don't know your situation.
[12:14.800 --> 12:17.840]  You may be out in the middle of the woods where nobody's coming for 20 miles.
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.120]  Still, I would be very careful just because you're in Prohibition Land.
[12:22.120 --> 12:23.720]  I wouldn't take those plants outside.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.840]  You may want to do that because you're a grown ass man and you can do whatever you want.
[12:26.840 --> 12:27.920]  I respect that.
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.840]  If you do choose to take these plants outside, let me give you some advice that can help
[12:31.840 --> 12:32.840]  you out.
[12:32.840 --> 12:36.000]  I would not take them out there and leave them in the sun for 12 hours.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.680]  I would absolutely introduce them slowly.
[12:38.680 --> 12:42.120]  I would take them out when the sun comes up for a couple of hours, maybe an hour or two,
[12:42.120 --> 12:44.480]  and watch them, see how they react.
[12:44.480 --> 12:46.200]  If they start getting weird, take them back in.
[12:46.200 --> 12:48.600]  Put them back under their normal grow lights.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.040]  Then maybe the next day, put them out there.
[12:50.040 --> 12:52.720]  If you went an hour the first day, maybe go two hours the next day.
[12:52.720 --> 12:54.600]  Maybe go three hours the next day.
[12:54.600 --> 12:57.560]  Slowly increase the outdoor interval and see how they react.
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.120]  You have to pay very close attention because if they start acting weird, you need to get
[13:01.120 --> 13:02.920]  them back indoors.
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.880]  I think if you put them out there for 12 hours underneath that natural light, I think that
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.360]  may be a little more than what they were ever used to.
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.200]  I would be like if I just kept you in a dark basement for a couple of years and then one
[13:13.200 --> 13:16.520]  Friday night I picked you up and took you to see the Pink Floyd light show, your eyes
[13:16.520 --> 13:17.520]  would blow out.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.520]  You wouldn't be able to handle it.
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.760]  I think the plants will feel the same way if we go put them under the sunlight for too
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.040]  long right away without any protection.
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.720]  If you've got a shadier spot to put them in at first and then move them into the sun,
[13:28.720 --> 13:30.600]  that also may be a good idea.
[13:30.600 --> 13:34.880]  It may not look like you're getting a lot of light out there in a shadier spot, but
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.480]  you are absolutely getting enough rays from the sun for it to affect that plant in comparison
[13:40.480 --> 13:43.560]  to what you were getting indoor under a grow light.
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.160]  That shadier spot outside is probably more efficient light than the grow light indoors,
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.280]  even if it's shady because it is the exact spectrum of light that your plants need and
[13:52.280 --> 13:53.780]  it's the sun.
[13:53.780 --> 13:57.600]  You're not going to dim the sun too much even with a whole bunch of clouds even in a shady
[13:57.600 --> 13:58.600]  spot.
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.600]  So maybe start that plant in a shadier area on your deck and then move it into the sunlight
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.060]  as the day goes on.
[14:04.060 --> 14:06.380]  But pay very close attention to your plants.
[14:06.380 --> 14:08.080]  Those plants are the boss.
[14:08.080 --> 14:11.120]  I can't say that all three are going to enjoy the same thing.
[14:11.120 --> 14:12.860]  You said you've got three different strains.
[14:12.860 --> 14:14.900]  You may get different responses from these plants.
[14:14.900 --> 14:17.160]  I don't know what they're going to do outside.
[14:17.160 --> 14:19.760]  So introduce them to the sunlight slowly.
[14:19.760 --> 14:23.380]  Pay close attention to them if you're going to do this.
[14:23.380 --> 14:26.800]  Another thing I'm thinking about, and I'm not sure how much this will apply to your
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.840]  plants, but those plants have never seen the sunlight.
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.720]  They don't know that there is sunlight.
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.360]  You may introduce them to the idea that there is a light outside much greater than they
[14:36.360 --> 14:39.400]  have ever experienced inside that grow room.
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.360]  Right now, they are growing because they are adjusted to the amount of light that they
[14:43.360 --> 14:44.360]  are getting.
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.680]  They're meeting their DLE because of that grow light.
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.280]  If you take them outside, they may get used to having more intense light.
[14:52.280 --> 14:53.840]  They may get spoiled.
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.080]  When you bring them back indoors and put them under your grow light, that's not going to
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.400]  be enough light to stimulate the photosynthesis that they were receiving, and they may begin
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.080]  to stretch ridiculously fast.
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.400]  That will be strain dependent.
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.920]  That will be genetic dependent, but that could be a thing that happens.
[15:10.920 --> 15:13.320]  That's like introducing somebody to ice cream.
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.160]  Somebody who has only eaten just a plain diet, they just have breakfast, lunch, and dinner,
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.640]  and no snacks, nothing sweet, nothing tasty, no kind of personal treats for their mouth
[15:21.640 --> 15:22.640]  ever.
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.800]  Then one day, you take them out to some fancy place and you give them just pretty good ice
[15:26.800 --> 15:27.800]  cream.
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.440]  Now they're like, holy shit, ice cream.
[15:29.440 --> 15:32.760]  They're never going to be satisfied with basic breakfast, lunch, and dinner anymore because
[15:32.760 --> 15:34.320]  you introduce them to ice cream.
[15:34.320 --> 15:35.320]  They were cool before.
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.000]  They didn't know ice cream was a thing, but now they're like, bro, ice cream?
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.760]  I need some of that shit because you introduced it to their lives.
[15:40.760 --> 15:43.280]  I feel like maybe the plants will react the same way.
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.120]  They'll say, hey, I was used to getting sunshine.
[15:46.120 --> 15:47.120]  That's a lot of light.
[15:47.120 --> 15:48.120]  You're not going to give me that.
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.480]  I'm going to keep stretching for it because I know that it is an option.
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.320]  When you take them indoors, that may backfire on you.
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.960]  I would completely not take these plants outside.
[15:56.960 --> 15:58.840]  You're risking bug problems.
[15:58.840 --> 16:01.460]  Then you're also risking snitches and thieves.
[16:01.460 --> 16:02.460]  That is terrible.
[16:02.460 --> 16:04.120]  I don't want you to go to jail.
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.200]  My next suggestion is if you're going to take them out there, if you insist on doing it,
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.880]  I would leave them out there.
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.880]  Don't take them out and bring them back in because then you're going to contaminate your
[16:13.880 --> 16:14.880]  grow room.
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.560]  Now, I know that the light cycle is probably not appropriate at this time for your auto
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.080]  flower plants to go outside to continue their flowering cycle, but that would be the best
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.320]  case scenario would just be take them outside and leave them to finish.
[16:26.320 --> 16:28.320]  I understand that is probably not an option.
[16:28.320 --> 16:30.820]  That's why you want to bring them back in and put them in your room.
[16:30.820 --> 16:32.320]  That scares me, honestly.
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.600]  We put a lot of time and effort into these grow rooms and to take plants outside just
[16:36.600 --> 16:39.840]  to get them a little bit of sunlight and bring them back in and then bring the bugs into
[16:39.840 --> 16:40.840]  the grow room.
[16:40.840 --> 16:42.480]  That really makes me paranoid.
[16:42.480 --> 16:45.980]  As a commercial cultivator, I've got a lot at stake.
[16:45.980 --> 16:48.400]  One bug can become a problem very quickly.
[16:48.400 --> 16:50.160]  It can cost a lot of money.
[16:50.160 --> 16:52.380]  This is your medicine that you're relying on.
[16:52.380 --> 16:54.240]  This is what's helping with your PTSD.
[16:54.240 --> 16:55.560]  I wouldn't risk it, my friend.
[16:55.560 --> 16:58.640]  I would just keep those plants in the grow room and keep them happy.
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.040]  Now, like I said before, you're an adult.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.520]  You can do whatever you want.
[17:02.520 --> 17:05.840]  Feel free to do what makes you happy because I know there's nothing like taking that plant
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.400]  out on the back deck, watching the birds fly around and the squirrels run around and smoking
[17:10.400 --> 17:13.880]  a fat joint, maybe taking a couple of pictures of those plants in the sunshine.
[17:13.880 --> 17:15.800]  I understand how good that's going to feel.
[17:15.800 --> 17:18.040]  If you want to do that, feel free.
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.040]  Have fun.
[17:19.040 --> 17:20.040]  Grow from your heart.
[17:20.040 --> 17:21.040]  Make yourself happy.
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.920]  Just understand the risks while you were doing so.
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.800]  Hey, I want to thank you for a great email.
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.240]  This was a lot of great content.
[17:27.240 --> 17:29.720]  Very useful information for a lot of people.
[17:29.720 --> 17:30.920]  There is one more sentence.
[17:30.920 --> 17:35.640]  It says, do you know anywhere that has feminized lemon Jeffrey seeds in stock?
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.760]  It sounds like a great strain, but I can't find it in stock online anywhere.
[17:39.760 --> 17:40.920]  Thanks again for all of your help.
[17:40.920 --> 17:43.040]  And I will send a pics when they finish.
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.600]  Thanks again from Prohibition Land.
[17:44.600 --> 17:45.600]  And then he signs his name.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.120]  Hey, thank you for the great email.
[17:47.120 --> 17:49.840]  I really look forward to those photos when they are finished.
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.680]  Now, about the lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds.
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.520]  I don't have any lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds for myself.
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.160]  I don't know where they are in stock anywhere at this time.
[18:01.160 --> 18:06.040]  If everything goes according to plan, there should be lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds available
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.280]  at Oregon Elite Seeds around the beginning or middle of July.
[18:11.280 --> 18:13.260]  That is the earliest I can promise those.
[18:13.260 --> 18:15.000]  They will be very limited.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.600]  This breeding batch was very small.
[18:16.600 --> 18:18.640]  We are very limited on our numbers here.
[18:18.640 --> 18:24.080]  So this batch was a very small batch, but around the middle or beginning of July, there
[18:24.080 --> 18:29.960]  will be very few packs of lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds available at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.240]  You guys, my throat just did a thing.
[18:31.240 --> 18:32.240]  I'm going to press pause.
[18:32.240 --> 18:33.800]  I'm going to take like seven fat dabs.
[18:33.800 --> 18:35.680]  I'm going to take a drink and then I'll be right back.
[18:35.680 --> 18:39.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, as promised, I
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.800]  took way too many dabs.
[18:40.800 --> 18:46.080]  I had a good drink and now I am back heavily medicated, well hydrated and ready for a good
[18:46.080 --> 18:47.080]  podcast.
[18:47.080 --> 18:49.200]  I've got another great email in front of me.
[18:49.200 --> 18:51.760]  This one goes a lot like this.
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.640]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.280]  I am in prohibition land, so no names if you use this on the show.
[18:57.280 --> 18:58.280]  Hey, that's easy.
[18:58.280 --> 18:59.280]  I've got your back.
[18:59.280 --> 19:02.640]  It goes on to say, I just wanted to say that I really enjoy your podcast.
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.680]  I have listened to all of the grow shows and I am very appreciative of the information
[19:06.680 --> 19:07.680]  and the help.
[19:07.680 --> 19:08.680]  Hey, thank you, man.
[19:08.680 --> 19:11.640]  That means a lot to me just to know that I'm helping somebody makes it worth all of the
[19:11.640 --> 19:12.640]  effort.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.640]  The message goes on.
[19:13.640 --> 19:18.520]  It says, this is my first grow and I am doing auto flowers under led lighting that I got
[19:18.520 --> 19:19.840]  from Amazon.
[19:19.840 --> 19:23.480]  I think the plants are about two weeks into flower, but I'm not positive because they
[19:23.480 --> 19:24.840]  are autos.
[19:24.840 --> 19:26.360]  The plants are doing okay.
[19:26.360 --> 19:29.160]  They are just not really big.
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.520]  Most are about a foot tall and they have really exploded in the last couple of weeks.
[19:33.520 --> 19:37.840]  I did use some LST and I have lots of exposed bud sites.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.960]  So he said he's done some low stress training.
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.900]  I'm not sure exactly what he's done, but he's done a little bit of training.
[19:42.900 --> 19:46.580]  The plants aren't very big, but they're taking off now that they are in flower.
[19:46.580 --> 19:47.580]  That is very common.
[19:47.580 --> 19:49.480]  So you've probably had them long enough.
[19:49.480 --> 19:52.540]  They've reached their age where the hormones have developed and they have triggered themselves
[19:52.540 --> 19:53.540]  into flower.
[19:53.540 --> 19:55.000]  They are flowering.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.040]  So far in this email, everything seems okay, but there is more.
[19:58.040 --> 20:01.040]  It says, anyway, my question is this.
[20:01.040 --> 20:06.080]  I have been using two kinds of cheaper LEDs, which I got from Amazon.
[20:06.080 --> 20:10.020]  After listening to your podcast, I have decided to do a veg and flower room and the cheaper
[20:10.020 --> 20:16.460]  LEDs are going to veg room and my new HLG 600 H LED should be here tomorrow.
[20:16.460 --> 20:21.480]  So he's ordered a horticultural lighting group 600 H LED and by the time we're reading
[20:21.480 --> 20:24.400]  this message on the show, it has arrived.
[20:24.400 --> 20:25.900]  Hopefully he's got it hung up.
[20:25.900 --> 20:27.140]  Hopefully I'm not too late.
[20:27.140 --> 20:31.240]  Hopefully I have still got some useful information for you in this episode.
[20:31.240 --> 20:33.380]  So you've got your HLG 600.
[20:33.380 --> 20:38.820]  You say this light is supposed to replace a 1000 watt DE, which means a double ended
[20:38.820 --> 20:39.820]  bulb.
[20:39.820 --> 20:44.140]  I don't know the par of my current lights, but I know what the par of the HLG 600 are
[20:44.140 --> 20:49.940]  supposed to be and they recommend to put the light 24 to 30 inches from the canopy
[20:49.940 --> 20:52.100]  because the par is so high.
[20:52.100 --> 20:55.820]  I obviously don't want to screw anything up since I am so far along.
[20:55.820 --> 20:59.580]  Any suggestions on height to start at the new lights and what to look for if the new
[20:59.580 --> 21:01.300]  light was to cause problems.
[21:01.300 --> 21:05.060]  I really appreciate everything you have helped me with so far.
[21:05.060 --> 21:07.140]  Keep the grow podcast coming.
[21:07.140 --> 21:08.620]  And then he signs his name.
[21:08.620 --> 21:10.420]  Hey, thank you for the great email.
[21:10.420 --> 21:13.100]  I promise to keep the grow lessons coming.
[21:13.100 --> 21:15.380]  Let's focus on this new grow light question.
[21:15.380 --> 21:17.060]  You've probably already got the light.
[21:17.060 --> 21:18.620]  It is probably already hung up.
[21:18.620 --> 21:22.900]  You've probably already got the plants underneath there and you were probably already doing a
[21:22.900 --> 21:24.000]  wonderful job.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.900]  It sounds like you were thinking and you know that you need to pay attention.
[21:26.900 --> 21:31.080]  So you probably paid close attention to the plants and you saw how they reacted and you
[21:31.080 --> 21:32.760]  adjusted accordingly.
[21:32.760 --> 21:36.620]  Let me tell you what I would have recommended had I read this email before you got your
[21:36.620 --> 21:37.900]  light delivered.
[21:37.900 --> 21:42.020]  I would assume and hope that your new light is quite a bit more powerful than your old
[21:42.020 --> 21:43.020]  light.
[21:43.020 --> 21:46.300]  You are absolutely correct in thinking that you may need to hang that light a little bit
[21:46.300 --> 21:48.880]  higher than the previous light was hung.
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.580]  So if the light that was in there before was let's say 16, 18 inches above the canopy,
[21:54.580 --> 21:59.220]  this one, you're going to want to start off maybe 24, maybe 30 inches away from the canopy.
[21:59.220 --> 22:02.740]  You say that they recommend 24 to 30 inches from the canopy.
[22:02.740 --> 22:08.520]  I would start off at least that far, run the light at full power and pay close attention.
[22:08.520 --> 22:12.520]  One of the things I should recommend you make sure to do is to keep this light on the exact
[22:12.520 --> 22:14.600]  same cycle which your old light was on.
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.040]  If you're in a flowering phase, stay at that flowering phase.
[22:18.040 --> 22:19.040]  Don't change anything.
[22:19.040 --> 22:20.040]  You're running auto flowers.
[22:20.040 --> 22:23.780]  Keep that light cycle the same so that you don't disrupt anything so that we don't have
[22:23.780 --> 22:28.400]  multiple variables to mess up our experiment so that we can see what is happening from
[22:28.400 --> 22:29.400]  the new light.
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.580]  So hang up the new light, pay close attention to it.
[22:31.580 --> 22:36.240]  You need a thermometer and a hygrometer in this environment so we can see if that new
[22:36.240 --> 22:41.160]  light is heating up the room or if it is drying out the room or causing excessive humidity.
[22:41.160 --> 22:42.200]  You've got a new light in there.
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.600]  We need to pay attention to what happens in the environment.
[22:45.600 --> 22:47.840]  We also need to pay close attention to the plants.
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.160]  You asked what we could watch for for these plants to see if they were frustrated.
[22:52.160 --> 22:53.540]  We want to pay attention to the heat.
[22:53.540 --> 22:57.120]  If they get too hot, they will start to make what I call taco leaves.
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.980]  Normally, the leaves should be basically flat.
[22:59.980 --> 23:01.820]  If they start to curl up, you'll see it.
[23:01.820 --> 23:04.280]  When you see a taco leaf, you'll go, oh, that's what he meant.
[23:04.280 --> 23:05.900]  It starts to make like a canoe.
[23:05.900 --> 23:07.880]  The middle of the leaf goes a little lower.
[23:07.880 --> 23:09.520]  The outer edges come up higher.
[23:09.520 --> 23:11.900]  If you were getting that leaf, you could almost pour water in there and it would sit
[23:11.900 --> 23:13.300]  right inside of that leaf.
[23:13.300 --> 23:15.120]  It makes a taco or a canoe.
[23:15.120 --> 23:16.940]  That is a sign of too much heat.
[23:16.940 --> 23:19.160]  If you were getting that, you've got too much heat.
[23:19.160 --> 23:23.100]  You can use your thermometer and that indicator right there on the plants to see if the heat
[23:23.100 --> 23:25.840]  has increased to a level that has made that plant uncomfortable.
[23:25.840 --> 23:27.740]  If so, you need to lower the heat in there.
[23:27.740 --> 23:29.880]  That is obviously the solution there.
[23:29.880 --> 23:34.720]  Now the thing we want to focus on after worrying about the heat is do we have too much light
[23:34.720 --> 23:35.720]  on our plants?
[23:35.720 --> 23:39.120]  Did we just increase the light to a level that makes them uncomfortable?
[23:39.120 --> 23:40.520]  Keep an eye on the leaves of the plant.
[23:40.520 --> 23:41.680]  Do they start drooping?
[23:41.680 --> 23:43.880]  Do they start pointing straight up?
[23:43.880 --> 23:47.000]  Those are indicators of how happy your plants are.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.300]  If the leaves begin to droop throughout your cycle, that means they have reached their
[23:51.300 --> 23:55.800]  daily light integral and they simply can't take any more light and they have put themselves
[23:55.800 --> 23:56.800]  to sleep.
[23:56.800 --> 23:59.160]  You may see those leaves just start to droop a little bit.
[23:59.160 --> 24:00.160]  That is natural.
[24:00.160 --> 24:01.160]  They're taking a nap.
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.160]  They're going to bed.
[24:02.160 --> 24:03.160]  It is nap time.
[24:03.160 --> 24:04.880]  They're going to start doing their nighttime stuff.
[24:04.880 --> 24:06.160]  They've had enough for the day.
[24:06.160 --> 24:09.440]  You may be able to reduce your light cycle if you see that.
[24:09.440 --> 24:11.920]  You may be able to reduce it by an hour or so.
[24:11.920 --> 24:16.600]  If your light is intense enough, if your new light is giving off enough increased intensity,
[24:16.600 --> 24:20.440]  your plants may be reaching their daily light integral earlier than they did before because
[24:20.440 --> 24:22.320]  they are receiving so much light.
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.980]  Pay attention to the leaf.
[24:23.980 --> 24:27.800]  If it starts to droop maybe an hour before you're used to, that is fine.
[24:27.800 --> 24:28.800]  That's expected.
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.800]  It's getting enough light.
[24:29.800 --> 24:30.800]  It is tired.
[24:30.800 --> 24:31.800]  It's trying to take a nap.
[24:31.800 --> 24:32.800]  It's going to bed a little bit early.
[24:32.800 --> 24:35.720]  That is an indicator that you may be able to adjust that light cycle.
[24:36.280 --> 24:38.120]  I am not an auto flower grower.
[24:38.120 --> 24:42.760]  I do not know enough about auto flowers to know if you should adjust your light to adjust
[24:42.760 --> 24:43.760]  to those plants.
[24:43.760 --> 24:45.560]  That is not my expertise.
[24:45.560 --> 24:47.680]  I don't know if he will answer your questions.
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.320]  The person I think of when I say auto flowers is Mephisto Genetics.
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.240]  That is who I would recommend and suggest in all things auto flower.
[24:55.240 --> 24:57.180]  Take your auto flower questions to Mephisto.
[24:57.180 --> 24:59.640]  He may be able to give you more details on that.
[24:59.640 --> 25:02.440]  Let's talk about this light because I do understand this part.
[25:02.440 --> 25:06.000]  The first thing you're going to see is leaves drooping or leaves pointing up.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.400]  You need to pay attention to the leaves.
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.240]  If they start drooping way early, that means that you are giving it too much light.
[25:11.240 --> 25:15.480]  I mean like within an hour of putting the light above those plants, they should not
[25:15.480 --> 25:16.480]  droop.
[25:16.480 --> 25:19.600]  If you see them droop, that means they are getting too much light and they're frustrated.
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.120]  Over a couple of days, if your leaves begin to twist, that means they are getting too
[25:23.120 --> 25:24.920]  much light and they are pissed off.
[25:24.920 --> 25:26.640]  Too much light is kind of a rare thing.
[25:26.640 --> 25:29.760]  I don't know that you can do it with an indoor light setup.
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.180]  You're going from an LED to an LED.
[25:32.180 --> 25:34.300]  Your plants should be excited about this.
[25:34.300 --> 25:35.980]  They should be happy with it.
[25:35.980 --> 25:38.820]  I would put that light up there and pay attention to them.
[25:38.820 --> 25:41.040]  Hang it as high as you can get it within reason.
[25:41.040 --> 25:45.140]  Start off, it says 25, let's see, it says 24 to 30 inches above the canopy.
[25:45.140 --> 25:46.640]  Start at 36 inches.
[25:46.640 --> 25:47.760]  Run it for two hours.
[25:47.760 --> 25:49.060]  See what the plants do.
[25:49.060 --> 25:50.100]  Check on the humidity.
[25:50.100 --> 25:51.140]  Check on the temperature.
[25:51.140 --> 25:52.540]  See if everything is right.
[25:52.540 --> 25:53.700]  Lower at six inches.
[25:53.700 --> 25:54.900]  Pay attention to the plants.
[25:54.900 --> 25:56.780]  Run it for a couple of hours like that.
[25:56.780 --> 25:57.780]  Keep an eye on the plants.
[25:57.780 --> 25:59.060]  You're the one that knows those plants.
[25:59.060 --> 26:01.540]  You should be able to see how they are reacting.
[26:01.540 --> 26:05.540]  You've been working with these plants for their entire veg phase plus two weeks of flower
[26:05.540 --> 26:06.540]  now.
[26:06.540 --> 26:08.820]  You should have a good idea of what these plants look like in the morning when they
[26:08.820 --> 26:09.820]  wake up.
[26:09.820 --> 26:12.940]  You should know what these plants look like in the mid-afternoon when you do your afternoon
[26:12.940 --> 26:16.260]  check and you should know what the plants look like when it is almost bedtime when you
[26:16.260 --> 26:18.980]  do the before bed check on your plants.
[26:18.980 --> 26:23.140]  So keep those things in mind and compare that to how the plant is reacting with this new
[26:23.140 --> 26:24.140]  light.
[26:24.140 --> 26:26.580]  The main things you're going to watch for is the leaves.
[26:26.580 --> 26:27.660]  Are the leaves drooping?
[26:27.660 --> 26:28.660]  Are they falling off?
[26:28.660 --> 26:29.660]  Do the plants look sad?
[26:29.660 --> 26:31.180]  Does it look over watered?
[26:31.180 --> 26:33.500]  Does it start to curl downward or upward?
[26:33.500 --> 26:35.240]  Those are signs of too much light.
[26:35.240 --> 26:39.140]  Now if the whole tip top of the plant starts bending over, it is trying to get away from
[26:39.140 --> 26:40.140]  the light.
[26:40.140 --> 26:41.140]  It is cooking.
[26:41.140 --> 26:44.300]  You definitely need to raise the light or reduce the power at that point.
[26:44.300 --> 26:47.980]  I think since you're going from LED to an improved LED, your plants are going to be
[26:47.980 --> 26:48.980]  happy.
[26:48.980 --> 26:49.980]  They're going to like it.
[26:49.980 --> 26:52.780]  The things you need to pay close attention to are the leaves.
[26:52.780 --> 26:55.700]  The next thing to think about is the VPD in that room.
[26:55.700 --> 26:57.940]  Have you changed the VPD by changing the light?
[26:57.940 --> 27:00.020]  I bet you were getting a whole different temperature.
[27:00.020 --> 27:01.500]  You're getting a different humidity.
[27:01.500 --> 27:04.900]  You were getting a lot of different changes that you're going to re-need to dial that
[27:04.900 --> 27:05.900]  room in.
[27:05.900 --> 27:09.500]  You need to readjust all of your climate controls if possible.
[27:09.500 --> 27:13.340]  Another thing you can do is grab those plants and see what they feel like.
[27:13.340 --> 27:16.220]  What is the leaf surface temperature in your garden?
[27:16.220 --> 27:17.220]  Do the plants feel cold?
[27:17.220 --> 27:18.660]  Do they feel too hot?
[27:18.660 --> 27:20.620]  Do you see the plants physically sweating?
[27:20.620 --> 27:22.720]  If they are sweating, they're too hot.
[27:22.720 --> 27:24.020]  They need to be separated.
[27:24.020 --> 27:25.260]  You don't want them touching in there.
[27:25.260 --> 27:26.380]  That's a whole other subject.
[27:26.940 --> 27:30.740]  You can tell by looking at the plants how they are liking or hating this new light.
[27:30.740 --> 27:34.160]  If they are drooping, if they look angry, they obviously don't like the new light.
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.560]  If over a couple of days, the leaves start to twist and curl, they absolutely do not
[27:38.560 --> 27:39.740]  like this new light.
[27:39.740 --> 27:44.460]  I think, like I said before, since you went from an LED to an upgraded LED, these plants
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.500]  should be happy.
[27:45.500 --> 27:47.220]  Start out about 36 inches.
[27:47.220 --> 27:48.540]  Give them a couple of hours.
[27:48.540 --> 27:50.060]  Drop it down to the 30 mark.
[27:50.060 --> 27:51.060]  Give it a couple of hours.
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.060]  See how they react.
[27:52.060 --> 27:53.500]  Maybe go to 24 inches.
[27:53.500 --> 27:54.500]  See how they react.
[27:54.500 --> 27:57.460]  If you don't see any adverse reactions, maybe go a little lower.
[27:57.460 --> 27:59.420]  I don't know how low you want to go with the LEDs.
[27:59.420 --> 28:00.540]  I don't know where they're at.
[28:00.540 --> 28:04.300]  There's a distance where you kind of ... It becomes a point of diminishing returns when
[28:04.300 --> 28:07.820]  you get your plants too close to the bulb because that super intense coming off of the
[28:07.820 --> 28:10.140]  light bulb there isn't even usable by the plants.
[28:10.140 --> 28:12.500]  You got to back it up to make it usable.
[28:12.500 --> 28:13.500]  Experiment.
[28:13.500 --> 28:14.780]  That is the best way to learn.
[28:14.780 --> 28:15.780]  Start off too high.
[28:15.780 --> 28:16.780]  Work your way down.
[28:16.780 --> 28:17.780]  Get too low.
[28:17.780 --> 28:18.860]  Watch the plants react to it.
[28:18.860 --> 28:22.260]  If you start seeing what I call they get their nails done, just the tips of the leaves start
[28:22.260 --> 28:26.140]  to look like shit, that is a good sign that you are giving them too much light.
[28:26.140 --> 28:30.020]  Now what will happen if you continue to develop buds, the buds will get bigger.
[28:30.020 --> 28:31.380]  They'll grow into the light.
[28:31.380 --> 28:33.940]  Then those tips of the buds will start to bleach themselves.
[28:33.940 --> 28:37.520]  We've seen that in a few magazines when it just looks like a little white tip on the
[28:37.520 --> 28:40.180]  top of the bud or the top of the bud is just bleached.
[28:40.180 --> 28:43.900]  That is from the plant being exposed to too much light during the flowering cycle.
[28:43.900 --> 28:48.040]  It simply bleached the chlorophyll out of the plant and that can absolutely happen with
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.180]  your LEDs.
[28:49.180 --> 28:51.260]  I don't think you're going to have a problem.
[28:51.260 --> 28:53.180]  I'm looking at this light right now on the website.
[28:53.180 --> 28:54.180]  This is a great light.
[28:54.180 --> 28:55.700]  This is a high quality light.
[28:55.700 --> 29:00.220]  Hey, HLG, if I can get you to send me one of these, what do we have here?
[29:00.220 --> 29:05.020]  An HLG 600H, I would gladly replace one of my thousand watt HPS lights.
[29:05.020 --> 29:11.260]  I would run it side by side and we can see what your HLG 600 versus my current HPS setup
[29:11.260 --> 29:12.260]  does.
[29:12.260 --> 29:13.260]  I would love to work with you.
[29:13.260 --> 29:14.260]  Let's do that.
[29:14.260 --> 29:16.220]  I'm just throwing out a shameless plug through the podcast here.
[29:16.220 --> 29:17.740]  This does look like a wonderful light.
[29:17.900 --> 29:22.260]  It is a quite pricey light, but it is going to save you money in electricity and in cooling
[29:22.260 --> 29:23.260]  costs.
[29:23.260 --> 29:24.820]  I think you are going to love this light.
[29:24.820 --> 29:26.460]  Congratulations on the great purchase.
[29:26.460 --> 29:29.500]  I really hope this does a great upgrade for your grow room.
[29:29.500 --> 29:31.940]  You just turbocharged your whole setup.
[29:31.940 --> 29:35.420]  Since you had the forethought to ask this question, I think you are going to be right
[29:35.420 --> 29:38.820]  on top of paying attention to your plants and knowing if they have gotten too close
[29:38.820 --> 29:39.820]  to the light.
[29:39.820 --> 29:44.140]  I think you were already forethinking, you were prepared and you know what to look for.
[29:44.140 --> 29:47.940]  I hope I gave you enough helpful advice to where you don't burn your plants.
[29:47.940 --> 29:48.940]  Let me know how it goes.
[29:48.940 --> 29:52.260]  By the time this episode comes out, you have got this light, it is hung up, the plants
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.140]  are under there and it is rocking.
[29:54.140 --> 29:56.460]  Give me an update, pictures or it didn't happen.
[29:56.460 --> 29:58.540]  Hey, I want to thank you for the great email.
[29:58.540 --> 30:00.700]  I do appreciate listener generated content.
[30:00.700 --> 30:02.600]  I hope I was able to help you out.
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.500]  Also thank you because you have inspired me to research LED lighting just a little bit
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.500]  more.
[30:07.500 --> 30:11.660]  Between this message and all of the talk about HLG lighting on the Dude Grow Show, I may
[30:11.660 --> 30:15.180]  have to reach out to those folks and see if we can't do some work together.
[30:15.180 --> 30:20.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, my throat and my voice are done podcasting today.
