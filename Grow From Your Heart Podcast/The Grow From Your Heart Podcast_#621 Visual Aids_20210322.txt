[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.820]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 620 of the Grow From Your
[00:12.820 --> 00:13.820]  Heart podcast.
[00:13.820 --> 00:17.460]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.
[00:17.460 --> 00:21.360]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:21.360 --> 00:27.120]  Of course, the 710 Club are my friends who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.440]  level or higher.
[00:28.440 --> 00:31.900]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:31.900 --> 00:35.200]  Thank you shout out to my friend, Sweet James Jones.
[00:35.200 --> 00:37.680]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Rico Relaxo.
[00:37.680 --> 00:40.760]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to my buddy, Mobius Grows.
[00:40.760 --> 00:44.640]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Chris B and Tartan Mike.
[00:44.640 --> 00:47.640]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Grant M and Black Hippie.
[00:47.640 --> 00:50.520]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my friend, Levity Loveday.
[00:50.520 --> 00:53.360]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Thomas M and Mr.
[00:53.360 --> 00:55.400]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Green Vet.
[00:55.400 --> 00:58.120]  And let's wrap it up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.120 --> 01:00.880]  Thank you shout out to my friend, Red Beard.
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.520]  Big thank you and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.040]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:09.040 --> 01:15.360]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.760]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:17.760 --> 01:21.840]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:21.840 --> 01:24.760]  make everything nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:24.760 --> 01:27.000]  All right, thanks for joining me, everybody.
[01:27.000 --> 01:28.800]  Thanks for those Patreon contributions.
[01:28.800 --> 01:31.440]  I do owe you an apology.
[01:31.440 --> 01:36.380]  If you watched the latest YouTube video, you may have noticed that that video was super
[01:36.380 --> 01:38.520]  grainy and not top quality.
[01:38.520 --> 01:40.040]  I apologize for that.
[01:40.040 --> 01:43.400]  I pride myself on putting out a top quality product.
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.560]  That video was not top quality.
[01:45.560 --> 01:47.680]  Mike and I, thanks to Mike for joining me.
[01:47.680 --> 01:49.840]  Mike and I recorded via Zoom.
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.860]  Everything looked beautiful on the computer screen.
[01:51.860 --> 01:52.860]  Everything sounded great.
[01:52.860 --> 01:57.000]  When I went to process the video and do the editing, it wasn't great.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.240]  I did not want to can it.
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.720]  I didn't want to throw that episode away.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.800]  I wanted to make sure you guys got to hear what Mike and I had to say, mainly what Mike
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.560]  had to say in that episode.
[02:04.560 --> 02:05.760]  Wanted to make sure that got put out.
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.940]  I did my best to clean it up, edit that a little bit, put that show out.
[02:09.940 --> 02:12.360]  But I know that was not up to Rasta Jeff standards.
[02:12.360 --> 02:14.840]  That was not Grow From Your Heart podcast standards.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.920]  I apologize.
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.520]  Things will be better in the future.
[02:17.520 --> 02:19.840]  I'll do my best to not make that happen.
[02:19.840 --> 02:22.360]  I think I have found the solution.
[02:22.360 --> 02:25.080]  I found a way to mitigate that problem.
[02:25.080 --> 02:26.440]  You guys don't care what the solution is.
[02:26.440 --> 02:28.000]  I almost rambled on about that.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.600]  But I found a way to record three different video options and three different audio options.
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.520]  I'll do my best to piece those three recordings together.
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.320]  That's six different recordings to make a top shelf podcast out of.
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.960]  I've got a backup plan for next time.
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.720]  I apologize that I failed you on the last episode.
[02:45.720 --> 02:47.720]  If you listened to the audio, you probably loved it.
[02:47.720 --> 02:50.520]  You didn't notice that it was a Zoom meeting that looked like shit.
[02:50.520 --> 02:53.200]  There were a couple of moments where it did kind of get staticky.
[02:53.200 --> 02:55.040]  But I'm rambling about an apology.
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.520]  You guys, I apologize.
[02:56.520 --> 02:59.280]  That episode was not up to par, not up to my standards.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.280]  I'll up my game.
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.320]  We'll get the stuff going properly in the future.
[03:03.320 --> 03:04.800]  But thank you for putting up with that.
[03:04.800 --> 03:06.480]  I do appreciate it.
[03:06.480 --> 03:08.640]  I did talk about the Edibles episode.
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.120]  If you watched that last episode, I told you I was going to recap the Edibles episode of
[03:13.120 --> 03:15.560]  the Embracing Organics podcast.
[03:15.560 --> 03:18.040]  Let's talk about Embracing Organics for a brief moment.
[03:18.040 --> 03:24.880]  Embracing Organics is a podcast or a YouTube show that happens live on YouTube every Thursday.
[03:24.880 --> 03:27.120]  It happens at 7 p.m. Mountain Time.
[03:27.120 --> 03:28.280]  I'm in the Mountain Time zone.
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.280]  I don't know where you are.
[03:29.280 --> 03:30.280]  I know my time zone.
[03:30.280 --> 03:31.440]  I know what time it is for me.
[03:31.440 --> 03:32.920]  You're going to have to translate.
[03:32.920 --> 03:33.920]  Use Google.
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.920]  It'll help you out.
[03:34.920 --> 03:37.840]  But Thursday at 7 p.m. Mountain Time for about two hours.
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.040]  Honestly, it's about 7.10, 7.15 because we like to take a few dabs and hang out.
[03:42.520 --> 03:46.960]  A little after 7 until about a little after 9, we hang out on YouTube and we talk about
[03:46.960 --> 03:48.040]  growing organically.
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.040]  We talk about growing.
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.040]  We talk about all kinds of random chaotic stuff.
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.960]  On one episode of the Embracing Organics show recently, we did eat a bunch of Edibles.
[03:56.960 --> 04:03.140]  I myself ate a 250 milligram dose of Edibles and we hung out and we tried to have a show.
[04:03.140 --> 04:04.140]  That was a good show.
[04:04.140 --> 04:05.140]  Let's recap that now.
[04:05.140 --> 04:08.940]  By the way, I did mention that if you do miss the live show of Embracing Organics, you can
[04:08.940 --> 04:10.200]  always catch the replay.
[04:10.200 --> 04:11.720]  The show stays up on YouTube.
[04:11.720 --> 04:14.080]  Once it's over, we repost it up to YouTube.
[04:14.080 --> 04:15.080]  It does stay.
[04:15.080 --> 04:17.480]  You can watch it basically forever.
[04:17.480 --> 04:19.440]  So search right now Embracing Organics.
[04:19.440 --> 04:20.800]  Give them a subscribe.
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.560]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[04:22.560 --> 04:29.080]  Anyway, let's talk about the Edibles challenge episode that I participated in on Embracing
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.120]  Organics with my friends.
[04:31.120 --> 04:34.600]  We all acquired the same Edibles, the same amount of Edibles.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.840]  Some of us ate all 250 right at the start of the show.
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.240]  Some of us kind of dosed ourselves slowly throughout the show.
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.040]  Some people didn't choose to eat all of the dosage.
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.160]  As I watched a few people just throw it all into their mouths at the start of the show,
[04:49.160 --> 04:54.040]  my plan was to eat 50 now, 50 later, see how it goes, maybe 50 more.
[04:54.040 --> 04:58.080]  A couple people threw all 250 in their mouths and I thought, I don't want to be late to
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.080]  the party.
[04:59.080 --> 05:01.840]  So I just ate all 250 right there at the beginning.
[05:01.840 --> 05:04.780]  I took a couple of monstrous dabs.
[05:04.780 --> 05:07.220]  After I ate the 250, I was like, I'm not super high.
[05:07.220 --> 05:10.180]  Then I took a dab that put me on another planet.
[05:10.180 --> 05:15.220]  And from there, I needed a seatbelt for my office chair because I felt like I was going
[05:15.220 --> 05:16.220]  to float away.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.220]  I was super high.
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.980]  So I ate the 250 milligrams of Edibles.
[05:19.980 --> 05:20.980]  I survived the show.
[05:20.980 --> 05:21.980]  I had a good time.
[05:21.980 --> 05:23.900]  I hung out in the after show.
[05:23.900 --> 05:28.560]  If you're part of the Embracing Organics live crew chat, part of their Patreon, we hang
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.180]  out with you after on Patreon.
[05:30.180 --> 05:31.180]  You're invited to come hang out.
[05:31.180 --> 05:32.180]  We give you a link.
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.340]  You can join the show.
[05:33.340 --> 05:35.340]  We let you hang out and join the video and we chat.
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.940]  I did a good job hanging out with those folks after.
[05:38.940 --> 05:42.740]  But as soon as I signed out, I ate everything in the refrigerator.
[05:42.740 --> 05:44.260]  I ate everything in the cupboards.
[05:44.260 --> 05:47.260]  And then I slept on the couch until I had to wake up and pee.
[05:47.260 --> 05:48.760]  Then I went back to sleep.
[05:48.760 --> 05:50.100]  And it was a blurry, blurry night.
[05:50.100 --> 05:51.660]  The next morning I woke up doing the damn.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.880]  Did I eat all of the food?
[05:52.880 --> 05:53.880]  And yes, I did.
[05:53.880 --> 05:55.740]  I ate all of the food.
[05:55.740 --> 05:57.780]  Drank all of the drinks.
[05:57.780 --> 05:58.780]  Consumed everything in the house.
[05:58.780 --> 06:00.940]  Smoked all of the concentrates also.
[06:00.940 --> 06:05.280]  The funny part was watching a few of my friends try to manage themselves.
[06:05.280 --> 06:07.740]  One of our friends, I may not say everybody's names.
[06:07.740 --> 06:09.100]  I don't know that they want to be called out.
[06:09.100 --> 06:11.580]  I don't need to embarrass our friends.
[06:11.580 --> 06:14.840]  One of our friends north of the border had to check out early.
[06:14.840 --> 06:15.840]  He was twisted.
[06:15.840 --> 06:16.840]  He was done.
[06:16.840 --> 06:17.840]  He was roasted.
[06:17.840 --> 06:18.840]  He was cooked.
[06:18.840 --> 06:19.840]  He was barbecued.
[06:19.840 --> 06:20.840]  It was over for him.
[06:20.840 --> 06:21.840]  We've got a Jamaican friend.
[06:21.840 --> 06:24.740]  Shout out to my Jamaican friend Rastafari.
[06:24.740 --> 06:26.580]  He looked like a statue.
[06:26.580 --> 06:28.260]  It looked like weekend at Bernie's at his house.
[06:28.260 --> 06:30.780]  He was laid out just a little.
[06:30.780 --> 06:32.300]  He was just one.
[06:32.300 --> 06:35.180]  If he didn't have such bad cotton mouth, he would have been drooling on himself, I do
[06:35.180 --> 06:36.180]  believe.
[06:36.180 --> 06:37.460]  But I guess he handled himself quite well.
[06:37.460 --> 06:40.540]  Dirtman Dan didn't seem to be very affected.
[06:40.540 --> 06:41.540]  Watching Keith try to handle...
[06:41.540 --> 06:43.140]  I said I wasn't going to say their names, but fuck it.
[06:43.140 --> 06:44.140]  We're saying their names.
[06:44.140 --> 06:45.820]  You're going to watch the show.
[06:45.820 --> 06:48.600]  Keith was going to stop at a certain amount of edibles.
[06:48.600 --> 06:50.460]  He was already plenty intoxicated.
[06:50.460 --> 06:51.460]  You could see it on his face.
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.900]  His mouth wasn't moving.
[06:52.900 --> 06:56.100]  He would say words, but his mouth wasn't making the right shape for those words.
[06:56.100 --> 06:57.860]  It's kind of funny to watch him, but...
[06:57.860 --> 07:00.340]  Oh, and he's kind of pale too.
[07:00.340 --> 07:05.540]  He said if he got so many likes on the video that he would eat more edibles.
[07:05.900 --> 07:08.540]  Basically, he said if he got 150, he would eat the 150.
[07:08.540 --> 07:13.140]  If we got 200 likes on the video, he would eat 200.
[07:13.140 --> 07:16.740]  I may be a smart ass and maybe not the best friend on the planet sometimes.
[07:16.740 --> 07:20.780]  I used my social media prowess and I posted to Facebook saying, hey, we're on this live
[07:20.780 --> 07:24.420]  video and if you post enough likes, my buddy will eat more edibles.
[07:24.420 --> 07:26.020]  Please come give us more likes.
[07:26.020 --> 07:27.020]  Guess what?
[07:27.020 --> 07:28.020]  My Facebook friends came through.
[07:28.020 --> 07:29.580]  Shout out to you guys for coming through.
[07:29.580 --> 07:32.620]  Keith ate way too many edibles that night.
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.420]  I think we had a good time.
[07:34.940 --> 07:36.900]  Oh, we got to see who could handle the edibles.
[07:36.900 --> 07:40.820]  Nobody honestly was wrecked in a dangerous position.
[07:40.820 --> 07:44.300]  I said that our Canadian friend checked out early because he was twisted.
[07:44.300 --> 07:45.300]  It was okay.
[07:45.300 --> 07:46.300]  He did the same thing I did.
[07:46.300 --> 07:48.180]  He ate way too much food and went to bed.
[07:48.180 --> 07:49.180]  He's still Canadian.
[07:49.180 --> 07:50.180]  He still talks funny.
[07:50.180 --> 07:51.740]  He's still killing it at life.
[07:51.740 --> 07:54.180]  Just took a few hours to get him out of that weed coma.
[07:54.180 --> 07:55.260]  So we all handled it pretty well.
[07:55.260 --> 07:56.260]  It was a good show.
[07:56.260 --> 08:00.500]  Once again, I encourage you to check out the Embracing Organics Edibles Challenge.
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.820]  Just search for Embracing Organics.
[08:01.820 --> 08:03.360]  You will find it.
[08:03.360 --> 08:04.360]  It's a good time.
[08:04.360 --> 08:05.600]  Where am I going from there?
[08:05.600 --> 08:08.360]  I got my medical marijuana card renewed.
[08:08.360 --> 08:09.360]  What?
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.360]  That's right.
[08:10.360 --> 08:13.840]  During COVID times, we are still getting our medical marijuana cards renewed.
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.840]  It's hard to get appointments.
[08:14.840 --> 08:17.920]  It's hard to do a lot of things in person.
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.720]  I got an email from my cannabis doctor that said, hey, it's time to renew.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.240]  Would you like to do it over the phone?
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.640]  And I said, sure.
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.320]  And they said, make an appointment on this app.
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.480]  So I clicked on a thing and it said, here are your times.
[08:28.480 --> 08:29.980]  And I picked a time.
[08:29.980 --> 08:32.920]  It said, be ready 10 minutes ahead of time to fill out a paper.
[08:33.480 --> 08:35.120]  I got a text message 10 minutes ahead of time.
[08:35.120 --> 08:36.120]  I filled out that paper.
[08:36.120 --> 08:37.120]  I hit send.
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.360]  After I hit send, I got a phone call.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.360]  It was the weed doctor.
[08:39.360 --> 08:42.680]  It said, hey, why do you need medical marijuana?
[08:42.680 --> 08:43.680]  And I explained why.
[08:43.680 --> 08:45.200]  And they said, have you had medical marijuana before?
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.120]  And I said, this is like my 14th or 15th year of renewing my card.
[08:49.120 --> 08:50.120]  They giggled.
[08:50.120 --> 08:51.440]  And they said, cool, your paperwork is pushed through.
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.760]  Give me your credit card number.
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.960]  I paid them for my medical marijuana card, filled out a couple of papers on the state.
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.280]  If the state didn't have a small snafu with my paperwork, it would have taken a total
[09:02.280 --> 09:04.720]  of two hours to get my medical marijuana card renewed.
[09:04.720 --> 09:07.680]  I didn't have to leave the house, didn't have to put on pants.
[09:07.680 --> 09:10.040]  Like I said, there was a small technical mistake.
[09:10.040 --> 09:11.040]  Not a big deal.
[09:11.040 --> 09:12.040]  Something was spelled wrong.
[09:12.040 --> 09:16.920]  And so it was just a technical, the other people, the service I used spelled my name
[09:16.920 --> 09:17.920]  wrong.
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.920]  My name is spelled wrong.
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.400]  Technically, they spelled it correctly, but it's not the way my full name is spelled,
[09:22.400 --> 09:24.520]  if that made any sense to you.
[09:24.520 --> 09:27.840]  But other than the quick snafu, it would have taken me a total of maybe two hours to get
[09:27.840 --> 09:30.480]  my weed card renewed, which is remarkable.
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.160]  Back in the day, we would make appointments and you would go to the weed doctor and you
[09:35.160 --> 09:38.480]  would realize that they just said, sure, come at 11.
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.360]  And they told everybody that called to come at 11 or whatever time they felt was good.
[09:43.360 --> 09:44.360]  They just said, come then.
[09:44.360 --> 09:45.360]  There were no appointments.
[09:45.360 --> 09:48.000]  We would stand in line all day.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.400]  Sometimes you'd get there at nine in the morning, you'd get to see the doc at five and they
[09:51.400 --> 09:53.520]  would sign your paperwork that day and send you on your way.
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.160]  It used to cost somewhere between three and $500 to see the doctor.
[09:58.160 --> 09:59.440]  This time it was 80 bucks.
[09:59.600 --> 10:02.200]  It used to cost 120 to register with the state.
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.160]  This time it was 25.
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.160]  It's getting much cheaper.
[10:05.160 --> 10:08.040]  The whole appointment, everything was $105.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.920]  It took me less than two hours.
[10:09.920 --> 10:11.120]  Didn't have to leave the house.
[10:11.120 --> 10:12.920]  Technically, didn't have to put on pants.
[10:12.920 --> 10:16.520]  I did wear pants just to make you feel better, but that was quick.
[10:16.520 --> 10:17.520]  That was easy.
[10:17.520 --> 10:19.280]  So I'm good for a solid year.
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.720]  Got my medical marijuana card.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.720]  Really comfortable.
[10:23.720 --> 10:26.260]  It was a really pain-free fucking flawless process.
[10:26.260 --> 10:28.800]  They call you and ask you a few questions.
[10:29.160 --> 10:30.760]  They ask you if you're crazy, basically.
[10:30.760 --> 10:32.960]  Do you have any mental conditions?
[10:32.960 --> 10:33.960]  Are you suicidal?
[10:33.960 --> 10:36.040]  Do you want to hurt yourself or anybody else?
[10:36.040 --> 10:37.040]  Are you pregnant?
[10:37.040 --> 10:39.080]  Weird shit like that.
[10:39.080 --> 10:41.040]  Most of the time you know how to answer the questions.
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.040]  It's so much easier over the phone.
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.520]  When I told her it was my 14th year or 15th year of renewing my card, she just started
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  typing.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.520]  She's like, we don't need to ask all these questions.
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.240]  We're just going to go ahead and I think you're ready to go.
[10:53.240 --> 10:54.480]  She re-gave me my card.
[10:54.480 --> 10:56.560]  So got the new weed card.
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.840]  Everything is good to go.
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.240]  Got my plant count taken care of.
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.560]  I do not opt for the increased plant counts because in Colorado we're limited to 12 plants
[11:05.560 --> 11:06.560]  anyway.
[11:06.560 --> 11:09.880]  If I were going to have a dispensary or something grow my plants, I may go for the extra plants,
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.240]  but I don't pay extra for the extended plant count.
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.240]  It doesn't make any sense.
[11:13.240 --> 11:14.560]  It's pointless for me.
[11:14.560 --> 11:16.800]  So I've just got the regular plant count.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.800]  Going to crush it with that.
[11:17.800 --> 11:18.800]  It's fine for me.
[11:18.800 --> 11:19.800]  It does what I need to do.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.000]  I've got a small grow space anyway.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.800]  I've made those numbers work for the past couple of years, so didn't need to increase.
[11:24.840 --> 11:29.360]  It was amazing how easy it would have been just to pay for the extended plant count,
[11:29.360 --> 11:30.840]  which is basically money.
[11:30.840 --> 11:32.840]  Allegedly, I'm not sure.
[11:32.840 --> 11:35.440]  Anyway, that was the weed card doctor.
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.320]  The next thing I want to talk about is congratulations to my friends at Cannabuzz.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.320]  That's right.
[11:40.320 --> 11:41.440]  I talk about Cannabuzz all the time.
[11:41.440 --> 11:42.920]  I'll do it quickly right now.
[11:42.920 --> 11:45.120]  Cannabuzz is a social media application.
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.120]  It's a lot like, excuse me, I'm just going to clear my throat real hard.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.120]  We'll keep going.
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.790]  Sorry, I did take a bunch of fat dabs before the show.
[11:54.830 --> 11:57.270]  I do have that dab throat happening.
[11:57.270 --> 11:59.190]  I'm sure you were as tired of it as I was.
[11:59.190 --> 12:01.630]  Anyway, Cannabuzz, it's a social media application.
[12:01.630 --> 12:05.670]  You can't buy, trade, or sell cannabis on there, but you can post all of your cannabis
[12:05.670 --> 12:10.530]  photography, dab videos, garden shots, all the stuff that the other social media applications
[12:10.530 --> 12:12.550]  will take down and ban you for.
[12:12.550 --> 12:14.150]  Bring that shit to Cannabuzz.
[12:14.150 --> 12:15.330]  We want to see your weed pics.
[12:15.330 --> 12:16.990]  Don't bring your booty pics.
[12:16.990 --> 12:18.350]  Don't bring your boobie shots.
[12:18.350 --> 12:19.350]  We don't need that there.
[12:19.350 --> 12:21.390]  I mean, be cute, but don't overdo it.
[12:21.390 --> 12:22.390]  That's all.
[12:22.390 --> 12:23.550]  There's plenty of that on IG.
[12:23.550 --> 12:26.670]  We want the cannabis community.
[12:26.670 --> 12:27.670]  Come post your weed pics.
[12:27.670 --> 12:32.630]  Anyway, on Cannabuzz, there was some controversy with the word Cannabuzz.
[12:32.630 --> 12:37.270]  Another company was claiming that they had a copyright on the word buzz and Cannabuzz
[12:37.270 --> 12:39.230]  couldn't use Cannabuzz.
[12:39.230 --> 12:41.350]  They had to hire a lawyer.
[12:41.350 --> 12:45.030]  Not to toot my own horn, I did my best to help with the contributions for the lawyer.
[12:45.030 --> 12:46.270]  We got the lawyer covered.
[12:46.270 --> 12:47.870]  A few other people helped as well.
[12:47.870 --> 12:51.270]  There were auctions, there were raffles, and things like that that helped cover the cost
[12:51.270 --> 12:52.270]  of the lawyer.
[12:52.270 --> 12:53.270]  I can't say I did it.
[12:53.270 --> 12:54.270]  I did my best to help.
[12:54.270 --> 12:58.510]  Also, a lot of Cannabuzz family, Iry Army, Grow From Your Heart Gang, we all helped out
[12:58.510 --> 12:59.510]  a lot.
[12:59.510 --> 13:00.510]  You helped out a lot.
[13:00.510 --> 13:01.510]  Thank you.
[13:01.510 --> 13:02.510]  Had to get a lawyer.
[13:02.510 --> 13:04.190]  Had to fight a copyright lawsuit.
[13:04.190 --> 13:09.070]  Congratulations to Cannabuzz because they won the motherfucking lawsuit.
[13:09.070 --> 13:10.910]  Shout out to my friends at Cannabuzz.
[13:10.910 --> 13:12.390]  They own the name Cannabuzz.
[13:12.390 --> 13:13.470]  Nobody can take it from them.
[13:13.470 --> 13:15.910]  The trademark lawsuit is over.
[13:15.910 --> 13:16.910]  They're keeping it.
[13:16.910 --> 13:17.910]  Good work, you guys.
[13:17.910 --> 13:18.910]  I'm happy for you.
[13:18.910 --> 13:20.830]  They don't have to change the name of the app, which would have been a total pain in
[13:20.830 --> 13:21.830]  the ass.
[13:21.830 --> 13:22.830]  Don't have to change branding.
[13:23.390 --> 13:24.950]  You guys, catch a buzz.
[13:24.950 --> 13:28.150]  Join us over on ... I probably don't even know that catch a buzz is something I can
[13:28.150 --> 13:29.150]  say.
[13:29.150 --> 13:30.150]  That's probably somebody else's.
[13:30.150 --> 13:32.870]  If not, cue, go copyright that shit.
[13:32.870 --> 13:33.870]  Catch a buzz.
[13:33.870 --> 13:35.590]  Join the community at Cannabuzz.
[13:35.590 --> 13:36.910]  I'm on Cannabuzz a lot.
[13:36.910 --> 13:39.470]  I've got nearly 60,000 Cannabuzz followers.
[13:39.470 --> 13:40.470]  Thank you, guys.
[13:40.470 --> 13:42.630]  I do a lot of shit on Cannabuzz.
[13:42.630 --> 13:43.630]  Post a lot.
[13:43.630 --> 13:45.350]  Do a lot of interaction there.
[13:45.350 --> 13:46.350]  Join me.
[13:46.350 --> 13:47.350]  I invite you.
[13:47.350 --> 13:48.350]  Cannabuzz, it's free.
[13:48.350 --> 13:49.350]  I am Iry underscore genetics.
[13:49.350 --> 13:52.870]  I wanted to say congrats to my friends because that has been an uphill battle and I'm glad
[13:52.870 --> 13:54.190]  it's finally over for you.
[13:54.190 --> 13:57.630]  Next, I want to give a special shout out to a friend of mine.
[13:57.630 --> 14:00.430]  He's a business partner, but more importantly, he's a friend of mine.
[14:00.430 --> 14:02.470]  More importantly, he is a good fucking person.
[14:02.470 --> 14:06.630]  I want to give a shout out to my friend James Bean from Seeds Here Now.
[14:06.630 --> 14:07.750]  This is not advertising.
[14:07.750 --> 14:11.310]  This is not a plug for Seeds Here Now, but do make sure to check out seedsherenow.com
[14:11.310 --> 14:13.830]  and use coupon code GFYH10.
[14:13.830 --> 14:18.350]  The important part here is that we acknowledge an outstanding person, an excellent member
[14:18.350 --> 14:21.030]  of the cannabis community and my friend James Bean.
[14:21.030 --> 14:23.270]  I'm not kissing his ass or doing anything like that.
[14:23.270 --> 14:28.510]  I did an episode talking about a person who was leaving their partner behind because their
[14:28.510 --> 14:31.670]  morals, their ideas, and their grow room ethics changed.
[14:31.670 --> 14:35.950]  Our viewer, our friend, wanted some advice and some guidance, basically some reassurance
[14:35.950 --> 14:38.350]  and some affirmation that they were doing the right thing.
[14:38.350 --> 14:41.870]  I talked about that person and gave them some guidance on the podcast.
[14:41.870 --> 14:46.390]  My friend, my business partner, James Bean, sent me a message and said, hey, that person
[14:46.390 --> 14:51.110]  is an awesome person and I would like to give them a reward.
[14:51.110 --> 14:53.590]  James Bean, that is admirable of you.
[14:53.590 --> 14:56.510]  You deserve a big high five, a salute, a shout out.
[14:56.510 --> 14:57.510]  You've got my respect.
[14:57.510 --> 15:00.990]  You already had my respect, but I want to make it known to the community how good of
[15:00.990 --> 15:02.330]  a person you are.
[15:02.330 --> 15:04.070]  You run a solid business.
[15:04.070 --> 15:05.550]  You talk a solid game.
[15:05.550 --> 15:09.150]  You're amazing on podcasts, but people may not know the truth that deep down inside you're
[15:09.150 --> 15:12.990]  a good fucking dude and I've got your back because you've always got my back and you've
[15:12.990 --> 15:14.630]  got the community's back.
[15:14.630 --> 15:15.630]  Wanted to take a moment.
[15:15.870 --> 15:18.550]  Shout out James Bean from Seeds here now.
[15:18.550 --> 15:23.390]  Also if you're the person that sent me that message, check your email or send me another
[15:23.390 --> 15:28.430]  email because we would like to help you out for being such a good person.
[15:28.430 --> 15:29.430]  Shout out, bro.
[15:29.430 --> 15:30.430]  Let's keep moving.
[15:30.430 --> 15:32.510]  I wanted to make sure to acknowledge my friend James Bean.
[15:32.510 --> 15:34.070]  Dude, I do appreciate you.
[15:34.070 --> 15:36.090]  The community does appreciate you.
[15:36.090 --> 15:37.090]  Thank you.
[15:37.090 --> 15:42.310]  Now this is the part of the show where we are going to read the listener emails.
[15:42.310 --> 15:43.710]  I've got cotton mouth so bad, you guys.
[15:43.790 --> 15:45.430]  I took so many fat dabs right before the show.
[15:45.430 --> 15:48.950]  I'm going to take a sip of this kombucha, recompose myself, and then we're going to
[15:48.950 --> 15:50.630]  read the listener emails here.
[15:50.630 --> 15:51.630]  Let's take a drink.
[15:51.630 --> 15:52.630]  Sip something with me.
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.630]  Hydrate, you guys.
[15:53.630 --> 15:54.630]  Hashtag SipsTea.
[15:54.630 --> 16:04.340]  All right.
[16:04.340 --> 16:05.340]  Not editing that out.
[16:05.340 --> 16:06.340]  I'm human.
[16:06.340 --> 16:08.140]  Thank you for joining me.
[16:08.140 --> 16:11.260]  Now here is the first email on this show.
[16:11.260 --> 16:13.460]  This one is titled, shout out question.
[16:13.460 --> 16:17.100]  It came from, actually I just grabbed this from YouTube.
[16:17.100 --> 16:21.500]  Somebody said, I joined the Patreon approximately two weeks ago and I still have not gotten
[16:21.620 --> 16:23.020]  a shout out.
[16:23.020 --> 16:24.460]  My friend Crazy Hand replied.
[16:24.460 --> 16:25.820]  This was a YouTube comment.
[16:25.820 --> 16:27.180]  Crazy Hand replied to the comment.
[16:27.180 --> 16:29.380]  It says, I feel he does it randomly.
[16:29.380 --> 16:31.860]  I have never heard mine on a shout out part.
[16:31.860 --> 16:33.020]  And then he mentioned it.
[16:33.020 --> 16:35.740]  And then he did me a solid and gave me a special shout out.
[16:35.740 --> 16:37.820]  And then he said my RNG is always bad.
[16:37.820 --> 16:42.420]  I can't remember what RNG stands for.
[16:42.420 --> 16:46.300]  So mainly the question here is, somebody said they signed up for Patreon approximately two
[16:46.300 --> 16:47.300]  weeks ago.
[16:47.300 --> 16:49.140]  I still haven't given them a shout out.
[16:49.140 --> 16:50.900]  There are a couple of reasons for that.
[16:51.300 --> 16:52.300]  It's nothing personal.
[16:52.300 --> 16:56.740]  I think this person actually did get their shout out shortly after this comment was posted.
[16:56.740 --> 17:00.460]  Let me explain why if you contribute to Patreon, sometimes it does take me a minute to give
[17:00.460 --> 17:01.660]  you a shout out.
[17:01.660 --> 17:04.340]  I am recorded one solid week ahead.
[17:04.340 --> 17:06.060]  I do two shows a week.
[17:06.060 --> 17:08.300]  I try to record both of them.
[17:08.300 --> 17:12.380]  So if the show that comes out Tuesday was recorded last Tuesday, basically, or the show
[17:12.380 --> 17:15.380]  that comes out Thursday was recorded the Tuesday before.
[17:15.380 --> 17:18.660]  So I'm several days ahead just in case something goes wrong.
[17:18.700 --> 17:22.500]  I don't want to have to get on the mic and record a show Thursday, edit it, post it,
[17:22.500 --> 17:24.980]  hope it comes out on YouTube on time on Thursday.
[17:24.980 --> 17:26.260]  I'm ahead of myself.
[17:26.260 --> 17:30.620]  So we got to wait for the episodes to come out in the order in which they come out.
[17:30.620 --> 17:35.400]  And with the COVID times, with fucking life the way that it is, I try to be at least one
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.860]  or two episodes ahead so that if something does go wrong in my life, I've got one or
[17:39.860 --> 17:43.140]  two loaded up in the can is what we say.
[17:43.140 --> 17:46.840]  I've got a couple loaded up that I can launch if something's wrong with me, if something's
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.120]  wrong with my gear, if my internet's down, I've got a backup plan.
[17:50.120 --> 17:54.440]  So you send me the message on the first saying, hey, I'm a patron.
[17:54.440 --> 17:55.440]  I want the shout out.
[17:55.440 --> 17:57.720]  I write it down on the first.
[17:57.720 --> 18:00.120]  Maybe I'll record on the third or fourth.
[18:00.120 --> 18:02.680]  Then that won't come out till the seventh maybe.
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.000]  And then maybe I recorded two episodes.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.400]  Maybe you're the second episode that month that I record.
[18:07.400 --> 18:09.200]  You're not going to get your shout out till the 10th.
[18:09.200 --> 18:10.200]  Maybe you're the third.
[18:10.200 --> 18:11.960]  You're looking at the 13th of the month now.
[18:11.960 --> 18:13.320]  So it's just about the first of the month.
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.200]  I write down the shout outs and then I record them through the month.
[18:16.200 --> 18:17.200]  It may just take a minute.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.280]  I do get to them.
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.640]  Also I'm getting, I don't want to complain.
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.560]  I'm getting an overwhelming amount of shout outs and amount, a overwhelming amount of
[18:26.560 --> 18:27.960]  contributions and response.
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.360]  I love it.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.360]  I can't keep up.
[18:30.360 --> 18:33.320]  I used to do 10 shout outs at the top of every episode.
[18:33.320 --> 18:36.120]  If you pay attention now, sometimes it's 12.
[18:36.120 --> 18:39.780]  Sometimes I extend it to 13 if the names are short and I can sneak it in.
[18:39.780 --> 18:43.640]  So it went from 10 shout outs every episode to 12 or 13.
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.400]  I may, and I can't make you a promise because my time is limited.
[18:47.400 --> 18:52.280]  I may have to step it up and do a third episode just to get the Patreon shout outs in every
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.640]  month, which if I can find another, uh, one more evening to record, I would love to give
[18:56.640 --> 18:57.640]  you a third episode.
[18:57.640 --> 19:01.360]  And if I can get the content, if you guys can send me more questions and shit, I would
[19:01.360 --> 19:02.880]  love to get that third episode out.
[19:02.880 --> 19:05.900]  I would make the adjustments, but that may be what has to happen.
[19:05.900 --> 19:11.000]  So the main issue is that you're, I get the Patreon notice on the first of the month.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.260]  And then I put out eight episodes every month.
[19:13.380 --> 19:15.740]  And you may get your shout out on that eighth episode.
[19:15.740 --> 19:17.620]  And I just go down the list, honestly.
[19:17.620 --> 19:20.940]  Uh, I just pick the seven 10 club and I just start writing their names.
[19:20.940 --> 19:24.580]  I actually type them into the computer and I just read them as they come up.
[19:24.580 --> 19:28.700]  So sometimes people get snuck in there if there's a special circumstance, like if it's
[19:28.700 --> 19:32.780]  your birthday or if you just contributed to Patreon today and you're brand new, maybe
[19:32.780 --> 19:34.240]  I'll put you on there.
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.360]  But for the most part, uh, they're random.
[19:36.360 --> 19:38.100]  They just, I get the notifications on the first.
[19:38.100 --> 19:40.020]  I try to get them all done by the end of the month.
[19:40.020 --> 19:42.340]  If not, I continue them through the next month.
[19:42.980 --> 19:44.940]  It used to be 10, excuse me.
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.620]  It used to be 10.
[19:45.620 --> 19:46.740]  Now it's 12 or 13.
[19:46.740 --> 19:48.180]  I may have to do that third episode.
[19:48.180 --> 19:51.700]  I'm trying to adjust my schedule for that third episode.
[19:52.060 --> 19:54.260]  You guys, podcasting isn't as easy as it looks.
[19:54.260 --> 19:56.300]  I gotta, uh, I gotta write the show.
[19:56.300 --> 19:57.520]  It has to come from somewhere.
[19:57.520 --> 19:58.780]  I got, I've talked about this before.
[19:58.780 --> 19:59.900]  We're not going to ramble too much.
[20:00.140 --> 20:01.660]  I got editing to do afterward.
[20:01.700 --> 20:04.500]  Then it takes a long time for YouTube to post it as well.
[20:04.500 --> 20:07.020]  So, uh, be patient.
[20:07.020 --> 20:09.660]  And if that's the same with the questions, if you've sent me your questions on
[20:09.660 --> 20:13.100]  Patreon on the first and I haven't read it by the second, please be patient.
[20:13.300 --> 20:15.820]  It may take me a few weeks to get to you.
[20:15.820 --> 20:18.100]  I'm recorded ahead, at least two episodes.
[20:18.420 --> 20:22.320]  And I've got questions lined up for at least four or five episodes already.
[20:22.540 --> 20:24.140]  I'm written ahead, recorded ahead.
[20:24.340 --> 20:25.200]  Please be patient.
[20:25.420 --> 20:27.780]  I do respect your questions, your time.
[20:27.940 --> 20:28.740]  I appreciate you.
[20:28.740 --> 20:29.860]  I don't want you to stop.
[20:30.220 --> 20:33.520]  Uh, keep in mind there are a lot of you and there's only one of me.
[20:33.520 --> 20:35.180]  This is a one man podcast.
[20:35.180 --> 20:36.860]  There's nobody behind the scenes here.
[20:37.220 --> 20:40.820]  Uh, I am the writer, editor, director, producer.
[20:41.140 --> 20:45.820]  Uh, I do all of this stuff, so please be patient with me, but don't stop.
[20:45.820 --> 20:46.940]  I like the pressure.
[20:46.940 --> 20:49.380]  I do no pressure, no diamonds.
[20:49.620 --> 20:54.260]  Uh, if you don't keep me, uh, going, I get lazy idle hands or the devil's playground.
[20:54.260 --> 20:56.140]  So you guys, please keep me overloaded.
[20:56.380 --> 20:57.340]  It inspires me.
[20:57.540 --> 20:58.620]  So don't stop.
[20:58.740 --> 20:59.260]  Can't stop.
[20:59.260 --> 20:59.900]  Won't stop.
[21:00.140 --> 21:02.800]  I'm fucking high and rambly, but let's keep it on track.
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.580]  I've got another great question.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.460]  This one came from Patreon.
[21:06.460 --> 21:10.980]  It came from Jackie Daytona and it said, no, actually this one came from YouTube.
[21:11.220 --> 21:12.820]  Came from Jackie Daytona on YouTube.
[21:12.820 --> 21:15.740]  And it said, Hey Jeff, thanks again for the great info.
[21:15.900 --> 21:19.900]  I had a thought when you were explaining nanners in a previous episode, I talked
[21:19.900 --> 21:23.740]  about nanners, uh, hermaphroditic male flowers and female plants.
[21:24.260 --> 21:25.820]  Uh, that's what I was calling nanners.
[21:26.100 --> 21:28.260]  It says people love visuals.
[21:28.420 --> 21:30.760]  I love visuals too, but I think you have something different
[21:30.760 --> 21:32.620]  in mind in this question here.
[21:32.700 --> 21:34.340]  I think you mean visual AIDS.
[21:34.660 --> 21:37.900]  It says, and sometimes a pop-up photo can show a good example
[21:37.900 --> 21:39.260]  of what you're talking about.
[21:39.660 --> 21:42.820]  Uh, I've been putting in photos right about here, uh, somewhere
[21:42.820 --> 21:44.380]  here in this region in the video.
[21:44.580 --> 21:46.620]  I've been learning a lot more with my editing equipment.
[21:46.620 --> 21:49.500]  I've got a couple of other ideas that may happen here in the future
[21:49.500 --> 21:51.820]  to give you some more, uh, visual AIDS.
[21:52.140 --> 21:55.900]  But, uh, it says nanners, herms, male, female parts, et cetera.
[21:56.180 --> 21:58.420]  People obviously can just Google it.
[21:58.420 --> 22:02.500]  However, it could really add a new dynamic to your already great podcast.
[22:02.860 --> 22:06.140]  Thank you for sharing your generous knowledge.
[22:06.380 --> 22:07.660]  Uh, man, Jackie Daytona.
[22:07.660 --> 22:08.040]  Thank you.
[22:08.040 --> 22:09.500]  I do appreciate that great comment.
[22:09.500 --> 22:10.220]  That is a good idea.
[22:10.220 --> 22:11.260]  That is great feedback.
[22:11.260 --> 22:14.980]  I love constructive criticism, uh, positive or negative feedback.
[22:14.980 --> 22:19.420]  As long as they're done politely or both taken well, uh, this is a great idea.
[22:19.420 --> 22:21.560]  You're very, very accurate and very correct.
[22:21.560 --> 22:26.100]  I should have posted a picture of a plant with a nanner right here.
[22:26.200 --> 22:27.580]  That was a missed opportunity.
[22:28.260 --> 22:29.540]  Good job on catching that.
[22:29.940 --> 22:32.140]  Uh, so now's a good time to catch up.
[22:32.340 --> 22:34.220]  Uh, never too late, right?
[22:34.220 --> 22:34.980]  Now's a good time.
[22:35.060 --> 22:37.500]  Better late than never is what I think my brain is trying to say.
[22:37.720 --> 22:41.100]  So at this point, I'm going to pop up a couple of photos here on the screen.
[22:41.100 --> 22:42.900]  And we're going to talk once again about nanners.
[22:42.900 --> 22:45.580]  If you listen to the episode about nanners, here is a great
[22:45.580 --> 22:47.260]  visual representation of nanners.
[22:47.260 --> 22:51.380]  What I'm going to show you is a female cannabis plant that is late into flower.
[22:51.380 --> 22:53.820]  This is a very well developed flower.
[22:53.960 --> 22:57.820]  And you will see that in the very center of this flower, there are two yellow
[22:57.820 --> 22:59.300]  things that just don't look right.
[22:59.300 --> 23:00.940]  Popping out of the center of the bud.
[23:01.180 --> 23:04.620]  I'm going to put the picture right here on the screen and right here in the center.
[23:04.900 --> 23:06.420]  Uh, I'll try to circle it or something.
[23:06.420 --> 23:09.260]  I need to learn the software, so I can't promise you what's going to happen, but
[23:09.260 --> 23:11.020]  I'll do something to indicate right here.
[23:11.420 --> 23:14.580]  This part that I'm showing is what I'm calling the nanner.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.300]  You'll see why we call that the banana.
[23:16.580 --> 23:17.860]  That is a female plant.
[23:18.060 --> 23:19.060]  It's got buds on it.
[23:19.060 --> 23:19.960]  It's got trichomes.
[23:19.960 --> 23:23.020]  We can see the female, uh, pistols is what you may want to call them.
[23:23.020 --> 23:27.460]  You can see the female clearly see that it's a female, but we see a couple of
[23:27.460 --> 23:29.420]  male parts in the middle of that plant.
[23:29.700 --> 23:30.980]  Those are nanners.
[23:31.220 --> 23:33.580]  That is what we call an intersex plant.
[23:33.580 --> 23:35.580]  That is what we call a hermaphrodite plant.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.820]  That is hermaphroditic.
[23:37.340 --> 23:41.720]  Sometimes those nanners contain pollen and that pollen can pollinate your room.
[23:42.080 --> 23:47.420]  Now, this plant is way too far beyond pollination point for that to be an issue.
[23:47.420 --> 23:51.100]  But if you've got younger plants in the room, that plant could receive the pollen.
[23:51.100 --> 23:55.420]  So that is what we call a nanner that could or could not contain pollen.
[23:56.220 --> 23:57.500]  Sometimes they have pollen.
[23:57.820 --> 23:59.380]  Sometimes they do not have pollen.
[23:59.380 --> 24:02.020]  Sometimes they have pollen that is non-viable.
[24:03.340 --> 24:05.520]  So that's what a nanner looks like.
[24:05.520 --> 24:08.960]  I'm going to scroll through my iPad here and find another picture and explain this
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.920]  one once again, this one, the thing that looks like a tongue sticking out of the
[24:13.920 --> 24:15.460]  bud, it looks like a yellow tongue.
[24:15.660 --> 24:16.740]  That is a nanner.
[24:16.740 --> 24:19.440]  That is a male flower sticking out of a female plant.
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.220]  Once again, we have got a hermaphrodite and intersex plant.
[24:23.940 --> 24:27.660]  So this plant, the past two shots that I showed you, there would be a decision to
[24:27.660 --> 24:33.100]  make. If there's no pollen coming out of those nanners, if you're running one crop
[24:33.100 --> 24:38.020]  on one cycle that has no chance of getting pollinated, you may keep that plant around.
[24:38.020 --> 24:42.940]  A couple of late nanners in late flower may not be detrimental to the grow.
[24:43.060 --> 24:46.380]  If it happens early, that's when I get rid of them for sure.
[24:46.380 --> 24:48.540]  If it happens in week one or week two, it's gone.
[24:48.540 --> 24:49.580]  Week three, it's gone.
[24:49.860 --> 24:52.380]  Week four, five and six, I'd probably get rid of it.
[24:52.380 --> 24:57.460]  Week eight, I would consider keeping that bad dog because the flowers are so far
[24:57.460 --> 24:59.420]  into bloom, they're so far into ripeness.
[24:59.780 --> 25:04.460]  The female parts which would receive that pollen are so recessed and dried up that
[25:04.460 --> 25:05.980]  that plant won't receive pollen.
[25:05.980 --> 25:06.940]  It will not pollinate.
[25:06.940 --> 25:08.180]  It will not make seeds.
[25:08.500 --> 25:15.420]  So this plant with this tongue looking male pollen sack sticking out, if that is the
[25:15.420 --> 25:19.040]  fire, if that's a really good cannabis and it only makes one or two of those on the
[25:19.040 --> 25:21.540]  entire plant, I may consider keeping that.
[25:21.540 --> 25:24.140]  But that is a clear picture of a nanner.
[25:24.300 --> 25:25.220]  Very good shot.
[25:25.220 --> 25:26.420]  I'm going to call this one a tongue.
[25:26.420 --> 25:27.420]  We got a new word for it.
[25:27.420 --> 25:28.980]  It looks like a tongue in my opinion.
[25:29.500 --> 25:31.980]  I'm going to scroll through my iPad and see what my next photo is.
[25:32.300 --> 25:37.540]  The next photo which I'm going to show you is a very clear shot of a cannabis plant
[25:37.820 --> 25:44.300]  with male and female sex parts clearly displayed in one single bud set of this
[25:44.300 --> 25:44.620]  plant.
[25:44.620 --> 25:45.660]  This is a lower bud.
[25:46.060 --> 25:47.580]  We can see the female parts.
[25:48.660 --> 25:52.820]  This little hair that we see coming off here, a lot of people call it the hairs.
[25:53.260 --> 25:55.740]  Those are, a lot of people are going to call it pistols.
[25:56.260 --> 25:57.580]  Those are stigmas or pistols.
[25:57.580 --> 25:58.980]  I may have said stamens a moment ago.
[25:58.980 --> 25:59.780]  That's the wrong word.
[25:59.780 --> 26:00.660]  I shouldn't have said stamen.
[26:00.660 --> 26:03.700]  I don't know why I said stamen talking about the female plants.
[26:04.220 --> 26:06.220]  Stigmas and pistols is what those are called.
[26:06.700 --> 26:07.860]  The little hairy parts here.
[26:08.260 --> 26:12.060]  This other part that's opened up, it looks like a seashell that opened or a flower
[26:12.060 --> 26:12.660]  that bloomed.
[26:13.060 --> 26:15.460]  That is a male cannabis flower.
[26:15.860 --> 26:18.020]  That part that opened up, the pollen was in there.
[26:18.300 --> 26:21.100]  That may have contained pollen that is now all over the garden.
[26:21.140 --> 26:22.820]  That part is actually the stamen.
[26:22.820 --> 26:24.420]  That part there is the stamen.
[26:24.700 --> 26:25.540]  It popped open.
[26:25.940 --> 26:30.380]  Uh, it may have shot pollen all over the plants next to this, the female parts,
[26:30.380 --> 26:33.500]  the pistols and the stigmas may have been pollinated.
[26:33.940 --> 26:36.820]  So this is a plant with clear intersex traits.
[26:36.820 --> 26:41.060]  We can see a male flower, a male pollen sack, which has been opened and we can
[26:41.060 --> 26:43.740]  see the female stigmas or pistols.
[26:44.420 --> 26:48.020]  So that is a very good shot to show you a male and a female.
[26:48.300 --> 26:50.820]  Now I'm going to scroll through my iPad and see what I've got next.
[26:51.100 --> 26:56.780]  The next photo is another shot of a male and a female flower on the same plant.
[26:56.940 --> 26:58.020]  They're early into flower.
[26:58.020 --> 27:01.820]  This is a great way to show you what a male flower is going to look like.
[27:02.100 --> 27:05.660]  So we've got a guy who is holding a small part of a plant to indicate
[27:05.660 --> 27:06.500]  what we're looking at.
[27:06.900 --> 27:10.100]  This part here that looks like a pod, it is seed shaped.
[27:10.100 --> 27:11.180]  It's bean shaped.
[27:11.500 --> 27:13.700]  That is a male flower.
[27:13.700 --> 27:19.340]  And that thing is a day or two away from opening up and pollinating the rest of
[27:19.340 --> 27:19.900]  the grow.
[27:20.020 --> 27:21.340]  That thing's big and beefy.
[27:21.500 --> 27:22.420]  It's swollen.
[27:22.660 --> 27:25.060]  It's going to come out just a little more and protrude.
[27:25.180 --> 27:26.420]  Then it will point down.
[27:26.460 --> 27:29.100]  Then it will open up and pollen will come out of that pollen sack.
[27:29.100 --> 27:32.060]  That is a very clear male pollen sack.
[27:32.060 --> 27:36.380]  However, further up the plant, the little bud that we see here, it's got those
[27:36.380 --> 27:39.940]  female parts, those little, the things you guys like to call hairs, those stigmas
[27:39.940 --> 27:41.580]  and pistols that are sticking off there.
[27:41.780 --> 27:43.340]  That is a clear female part.
[27:43.700 --> 27:50.180]  And then you can see, I can see swollen calyxes or swollen bracts, which I will
[27:50.180 --> 27:55.460]  assume are seeded already or are developing seeds or will develop seeds.
[27:55.700 --> 27:59.860]  So that is a very clear shot of a hermaphroditic plant, a male,
[27:59.940 --> 28:01.820]  female intersex plant.
[28:02.100 --> 28:02.380]  All right.
[28:02.380 --> 28:06.940]  I think I've made it clear what male, this part right here, that is a male plant.
[28:07.100 --> 28:09.580]  That part, not a male plant, that is a male part.
[28:09.740 --> 28:12.020]  If your plant showed that, it is probably a male.
[28:12.180 --> 28:16.140]  If it's got these hairy parts up here, that's what we're looking for in a female.
[28:16.300 --> 28:18.220]  I'll try to post a solid picture of a male.
[28:18.260 --> 28:19.020]  That's a boy.
[28:19.460 --> 28:21.340]  Now I'll post a solid picture of a female.
[28:21.740 --> 28:22.620]  That's a female.
[28:22.900 --> 28:24.980]  And now you've seen what the intersex plants look like.
[28:25.180 --> 28:28.420]  Now I've made it clear what nanners look like, what males look like, what females
[28:28.420 --> 28:30.260]  look like, what intersex plants look like.
[28:30.580 --> 28:32.300]  That should help you out quite a bit.
[28:32.540 --> 28:39.020]  One thing that you should not get paranoid about are swollen bracts or swollen calyxes.
[28:39.340 --> 28:43.140]  When you're looking at a cannabis plant, the parts that develop are calyxes and
[28:43.140 --> 28:44.380]  bracts, they keep growing.
[28:45.140 --> 28:49.940]  Sometimes those look like they're swollen and they look like they are male parts.
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.260]  Those are not male parts.
[28:52.260 --> 28:54.540]  They will be at the bottom of the bud.
[28:54.540 --> 28:57.260]  So you'll have a little branch and at the bottom of the bud, it'll start to look
[28:57.260 --> 28:58.060]  like popcorn.
[28:58.060 --> 28:59.060]  It'll have little balls.
[28:59.660 --> 29:03.700]  Those could be swollen bracts or calyxes.
[29:03.980 --> 29:05.300]  Don't overjudge.
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.540]  Don't get too paranoid.
[29:06.540 --> 29:10.980]  Don't get too excited and get too quick to cut down a plant that is showing you
[29:10.980 --> 29:13.700]  female parts because you think it may be a male.
[29:14.100 --> 29:15.900]  Verify, make sure that it's a male.
[29:16.140 --> 29:20.220]  At the intersections, at the nodes, is where you're most likely to see the first
[29:20.220 --> 29:21.540]  signs of male sex.
[29:21.860 --> 29:26.500]  If you're seeing those balls and the buds, that is probably a swollen calyx or a
[29:26.500 --> 29:29.780]  bract that is just swollen because it's developing the way it should.
[29:30.020 --> 29:30.980]  Don't be paranoid.
[29:31.540 --> 29:33.100]  Don't let your mind play tricks on you.
[29:33.700 --> 29:37.900]  And most importantly, don't cut down a female because you've mistaken it for a
[29:37.900 --> 29:39.060]  male plant.
[29:39.460 --> 29:39.700]  All right.
[29:39.700 --> 29:41.220]  I think that is all I've got.
[29:41.420 --> 29:43.700]  I want to thank everybody on social media.
[29:43.700 --> 29:48.540]  I posted, Hey guys, I need, and gals, I need a photo of hermaphroditic plants and
[29:48.540 --> 29:50.620]  I especially need a shot with some nanners in it.
[29:50.900 --> 29:55.060]  I want to thank all of my friends who sent me pictures of plants with nanners.
[29:55.340 --> 29:59.180]  Uh, I did withheld, withhold their names to protect the innocent.
[29:59.180 --> 30:03.460]  I don't want to say, Hey, my buddy, Jim has hermaphroditic plants in his garden.
[30:03.540 --> 30:04.380]  Here you go.
[30:04.540 --> 30:08.180]  I just felt it would be best to keep those names, uh, to myself.
[30:08.420 --> 30:09.780]  Keep those people protected.
[30:09.980 --> 30:14.900]  I may also show at the end of the video, I may just pop up a few more pictures of
[30:14.900 --> 30:16.700]  intersex plants cause I did get a lot.
[30:16.700 --> 30:20.620]  So I want to thank all of my friends who sent me all of the marvelous intersex
[30:20.620 --> 30:21.300]  plant pictures.
[30:21.300 --> 30:24.380]  I got so many, uh, some of them made me sick to my stomach.
[30:24.380 --> 30:26.620]  Some of them were exactly what I was looking for.
[30:26.900 --> 30:27.580]  Thank you.
[30:27.820 --> 30:30.420]  Uh, I thought it was great that I had to reach out and ask for
[30:30.420 --> 30:32.140]  pictures of intersex plants.
[30:32.140 --> 30:34.620]  Being a breeder, you'd think I'd have that, but guess what?
[30:35.140 --> 30:35.900]  I don't have that.
[30:36.300 --> 30:37.660]  Maybe I just didn't take enough pictures.
[30:37.660 --> 30:39.140]  We don't take pics of our fuck ups, right?
[30:39.140 --> 30:40.540]  You only take pictures of the good stuff.
[30:40.940 --> 30:42.500]  All right, you guys, I'm going to quit rambling.
[30:42.500 --> 30:44.020]  I got nice and high before this episode.
[30:44.020 --> 30:45.820]  So I want to thank you for putting up with my rambles.
[30:46.020 --> 30:47.860]  I want to thank you for putting up with their throat clearing.
[30:48.060 --> 30:51.620]  Uh, once again, I apologize for that last episode, but I want to thank you for
