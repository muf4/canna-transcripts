[00:01.920 --> 00:04.960]  Hey what's up ladies and gentlemen, it's Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.960 --> 00:05.960]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:05.960 --> 00:08.720]  I'm doing that thing where I release old episodes.
[00:08.720 --> 00:13.520]  Today I'm going to put out episodes 25, 26, and 27 of what used to be known as the
[00:13.520 --> 00:17.800]  I Grow Culture podcast, currently known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:17.800 --> 00:20.760]  Before we get started on the show, let me make a few disclaimers.
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.120]  A lot of my ideas, opinions, methods, and techniques may have changed.
[00:25.120 --> 00:27.200]  I've been doing this podcast for two years now.
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.280]  When I first started, I did some shit differently.
[00:29.280 --> 00:32.120]  Hopefully we have all learned a lot of things since then.
[00:32.120 --> 00:33.120]  Stuff may be different.
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.720]  Don't hold it against me if I have different ideas and techniques now than I did then.
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.360]  Also, all of the social media has changed.
[00:40.360 --> 00:42.160]  All of the I Grow Culture stuff, it's gone.
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.200]  I don't answer any of that.
[00:43.200 --> 00:44.200]  I don't read that.
[00:44.200 --> 00:47.640]  I don't answer, open, reply, respond, or think about any of that stuff.
[00:47.640 --> 00:50.640]  So if you wish to contact me, please send me an email.
[00:50.640 --> 00:53.000]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.

[01:14.960 --> 01:15.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy.
[01:15.960 --> 02:22.670]  What's up ladies and gentlemen?
[02:22.670 --> 02:26.870]  Welcome to episode number 25 of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[02:26.870 --> 02:29.190]  I'm your host Ross DeGeff.
[02:29.190 --> 02:31.350]  Thanks again for joining me for the 25th episode.
[02:31.350 --> 02:32.950]  I'm so excited to be here.
[02:32.950 --> 02:36.230]  Big shout out to Task Rock for letting me play his tracks in the background.
[02:36.230 --> 02:38.670]  You're listening to Task and Linus at 710 The Movement.
[02:38.670 --> 02:42.510]  Tonight we have Kevin and Adam over here.
[02:42.510 --> 02:43.510]  What's up guys?
[02:43.510 --> 02:44.510]  It's been a while.
[02:44.510 --> 02:45.510]  What is up?
[02:45.510 --> 02:47.070]  Kevin looks like he's having a seizure while he's trying to dance.
[02:47.070 --> 02:48.550]  It's some funny shit to watch.
[02:48.550 --> 02:52.630]  I looked up from the recording equipment and I'm like, what can I say?
[02:53.590 --> 02:55.710]  Yeah, I think you're doing the Humpty dance.
[02:55.710 --> 02:57.190]  Might have been what that was.
[02:57.190 --> 02:58.750]  It was getting there.
[02:58.750 --> 03:01.910]  You look like MC Hammer on crack Humpty.
[03:01.910 --> 03:02.910]  Yeah.
[03:02.910 --> 03:06.950]  I got to catch my breath from some dabs we took, but we're going to have a great 25th
[03:06.950 --> 03:07.950]  episode.
[03:07.950 --> 03:08.950]  I'm excited.
[03:08.950 --> 03:09.950]  This is cool.
[03:09.950 --> 03:10.950]  So what are you guys doing?
[03:10.950 --> 03:11.950]  How are you guys man?
[03:11.950 --> 03:12.950]  What's going on?
[03:12.950 --> 03:13.950]  Great.
[03:13.950 --> 03:14.950]  I'm pumped man.
[03:14.950 --> 03:15.950]  Ready and glad to be here for 25.
[03:15.950 --> 03:16.950]  You just showed up bro.
[03:16.950 --> 03:17.950]  Thanks for getting here right on time.
[03:17.950 --> 03:19.150]  Running a little late.
[03:19.150 --> 03:21.030]  Things are pretty crazy at the hut.
[03:21.830 --> 03:25.190]  It gave Kevin and I some time to take some dabs and hang out at the hut.
[03:25.190 --> 03:26.190]  Did you call it the hut?
[03:26.190 --> 03:27.190]  Oh, the hut.
[03:27.190 --> 03:28.190]  Not your house.
[03:28.190 --> 03:29.190]  The hut.
[03:29.190 --> 03:30.190]  No, the actual hut.
[03:30.190 --> 03:31.190]  Jabba owns it.
[03:31.190 --> 03:32.190]  Jabba owns the, that hut.
[03:32.190 --> 03:33.190]  Word.
[03:33.190 --> 03:36.790]  So also I should mention that we've got the email set up next to us on the Eric Ross 4.0
[03:36.790 --> 03:37.790]  rig.
[03:37.790 --> 03:40.350]  So say hello to the email, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:40.350 --> 03:41.750]  That's the email talking back to you.
[03:41.750 --> 03:43.590]  It'll be doing a lot of work tonight.
[03:43.590 --> 03:46.070]  All right, I'm better.
[03:46.070 --> 03:47.070]  I got a cough.
[03:47.070 --> 03:48.390]  I feel like we're doing good.
[03:48.390 --> 03:49.390]  What happened to the music?
[03:49.390 --> 03:50.390]  Who's responsible for that?
[03:50.750 --> 03:51.750]  I think you are.
[03:51.750 --> 03:52.750]  Here it comes.
[03:52.750 --> 03:53.750]  It's coming again.
[03:53.750 --> 03:54.750]  Watch.
[03:54.750 --> 03:55.750]  There's the music.
[03:55.750 --> 03:56.750]  There it is.
[03:56.750 --> 03:57.750]  Just roll it again.
[03:57.750 --> 03:58.750]  Do it again.
[03:58.750 --> 03:59.750]  Yeah.
[03:59.750 --> 04:00.750]  Do it again.
[04:00.750 --> 04:01.750]  No, we'll just do it that one time.
[04:01.750 --> 04:02.750]  All right.
[04:02.750 --> 04:03.750]  So, uh, man, thanks for coming to guys.
[04:03.750 --> 04:04.750]  It's episode 25.
[04:04.750 --> 04:07.710]  I wanted you guys here because, uh, Spence and Jesse are hard to get here or they would
[04:07.710 --> 04:08.710]  have been here too.
[04:08.710 --> 04:11.110]  But, uh, of course at this time of night, they're not coming.
[04:11.110 --> 04:12.110]  So we're the second choice.
[04:12.110 --> 04:13.110]  No, I want all four.
[04:13.110 --> 04:14.110]  I heard that too.
[04:14.110 --> 04:15.110]  It's okay.
[04:15.110 --> 04:16.110]  It's not, not.
[04:16.110 --> 04:17.110]  Oh, fuck.
[04:17.110 --> 04:18.110]  I appreciate the invite regardless.
[04:18.110 --> 04:19.110]  Yeah.
[04:19.110 --> 04:20.110]  Yeah.
[04:20.110 --> 04:21.110]  I love coming over.
[04:21.110 --> 04:22.110]  I love that I'm all high and you guys want to turn that and make me sound like a dick.
[04:22.110 --> 04:23.110]  No, I wanted all four of you here.
[04:23.110 --> 04:24.110]  All right.
[04:24.110 --> 04:25.110]  I wanted all four of you guys here.
[04:25.110 --> 04:26.110]  That would have been dope.
[04:26.110 --> 04:27.110]  That would have been loud, but it would have been fun.
[04:27.110 --> 04:28.110]  It would have been a lot of fun.
[04:28.110 --> 04:29.110]  We would have had to get more chairs out, more microphones.
[04:29.110 --> 04:30.110]  It would have been pretty awesome.
[04:30.110 --> 04:31.110]  But imagine, uh, probably one other dab rig.
[04:31.110 --> 04:32.110]  Yeah, at least.
[04:32.110 --> 04:33.110]  But it's like, it's kind of, it's like one in the morning.
[04:33.110 --> 04:34.110]  You guys that are listening, it's one in the morning on Friday night.
[04:34.110 --> 04:35.110]  That's my fault.
[04:35.110 --> 04:36.110]  I'm sorry.
[04:36.110 --> 04:37.110]  I'm sorry.
[04:37.110 --> 04:38.110]  I'm sorry.
[04:38.110 --> 04:39.110]  I'm sorry.
[04:39.110 --> 04:40.110]  I'm sorry.
[05:10.110 --> 05:11.110]  It's like, yeah.
[05:11.110 --> 05:12.110]  We all had shit to do.
[05:12.110 --> 05:13.110]  I'm a grower.
[05:13.110 --> 05:14.110]  Kev's got a life.
[05:14.110 --> 05:15.110]  Ish.
[05:15.110 --> 05:16.110]  Ish.
[05:16.110 --> 05:17.110]  Life-ish.
[05:17.110 --> 05:18.110]  My second choice is you got me feeling bad and shit.
[05:18.110 --> 05:19.110]  Man.
[05:19.110 --> 05:20.110]  God.
[05:20.110 --> 05:21.110]  Man.
[05:21.110 --> 05:22.110]  You're good.
[05:22.110 --> 05:23.110]  Jeez.
[05:23.110 --> 05:24.110]  We love you, buddy.
[05:24.110 --> 05:25.110]  I'm just giving you shit.
[05:25.110 --> 05:26.110]  Make me cry on the 25th episode.
[05:26.110 --> 05:27.110]  Anyway.
[05:27.110 --> 05:28.610]  So last night, uh, Adam and myself and another friend went to a comedy show, a comedy show
[05:28.610 --> 05:29.610]  called, uh, Manhood.
[05:29.610 --> 05:36.350]  Manhood and, uh, we're like, I think it was called like, uh, Manhood and Suicide.
[05:36.350 --> 05:39.890]  shows or you can get $5 tickets to a bunch of other shows.
[05:39.890 --> 05:41.470]  And they do it just to fill the seats
[05:41.470 --> 05:42.570]  is what they're trying to do.
[05:42.570 --> 05:44.190]  And I see why now that we got there,
[05:44.190 --> 05:47.030]  why that comedy show was $5.
[05:47.030 --> 05:50.130]  But I told him next time, give me somebody dirty.
[05:50.130 --> 05:52.890]  I was like, I want something dirtier, a little filthy.
[05:52.890 --> 05:55.570]  The opening act, there was a host who I always forget
[05:55.570 --> 05:57.410]  his name, it's Ron something and I feel bad
[05:57.410 --> 05:58.250]  that I forget his name.
[05:58.250 --> 06:01.050]  He's a comedian, well known for doing dabs,
[06:01.050 --> 06:02.890]  dab jokes, weed jokes.
[06:02.890 --> 06:04.370]  He's pretty funny, he's a good host.
[06:04.370 --> 06:06.130]  He's getting better at being a host.
[06:06.890 --> 06:08.490]  Is he like in a comedy group?
[06:08.490 --> 06:09.770]  He used to be, I think.
[06:09.770 --> 06:11.030]  He's a short dude.
[06:12.730 --> 06:14.770]  Sorry to call you short, bro, but I'm six five.
[06:14.770 --> 06:16.410]  Everybody's fucking short to me.
[06:17.810 --> 06:19.010]  We'll look him up, we'll Google him
[06:19.010 --> 06:20.170]  when we take a dab break.
[06:20.170 --> 06:21.090]  What was his name again?
[06:21.090 --> 06:23.690]  Ron was his first name, I'm pretty sure.
[06:23.690 --> 06:25.570]  He's a real friendly looking, but he's a comedian, man.
[06:25.570 --> 06:27.210]  So anything I say to describe him is gonna make,
[06:27.210 --> 06:28.970]  he's a real friendly looking dude, he's short,
[06:28.970 --> 06:29.810]  he's done a bit of a good.
[06:29.810 --> 06:30.630]  I would like to know if he was one of the guys
[06:30.630 --> 06:31.850]  I saw at Phil's one night,
[06:31.850 --> 06:35.330]  because there were two comedians that came down from Denver
[06:35.330 --> 06:37.770]  that were fucking hilarious
[06:37.770 --> 06:40.130]  and did some awesome dab jokes and shit.
[06:40.130 --> 06:41.050]  Could have been this guy.
[06:41.050 --> 06:42.850]  I actually tipped him with some goodies
[06:42.850 --> 06:44.570]  because of the jokes that he made.
[06:44.570 --> 06:46.130]  Some goodies, I like that.
[06:46.130 --> 06:47.650]  Two comedians that did that shit.
[06:47.650 --> 06:49.890]  Well, following up, that guy was the host.
[06:49.890 --> 06:52.090]  Following him was a guy named Deacon Gray, right?
[06:52.090 --> 06:54.170]  Was there a comedian before Deacon Gray?
[06:54.170 --> 06:57.210]  Yeah, yeah, Deacon, oh no, because it seemed like
[06:57.210 --> 06:59.050]  the host did a short set.
[06:59.050 --> 07:00.290]  The host did a five set.
[07:00.290 --> 07:01.610]  Okay. A five minute set.
[07:01.610 --> 07:03.130]  And then Deacon Gray came out,
[07:03.130 --> 07:04.370]  and if you guys don't know Deacon Gray,
[07:05.010 --> 07:08.050]  Deacon Gray is a Denver local, as far as I know.
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.290]  He's funny as shit.
[07:09.290 --> 07:10.130]  Hilarious.
[07:10.130 --> 07:10.950]  He's kind of an older dude,
[07:10.950 --> 07:12.570]  and he's had time to calm down.
[07:12.570 --> 07:13.770]  He's not a hyper kid,
[07:13.770 --> 07:16.290]  and he's got his delivery is flawless.
[07:16.290 --> 07:18.710]  He doesn't look like he's up there performing.
[07:18.710 --> 07:21.290]  He's up there having as much fun as we are.
[07:21.290 --> 07:23.090]  And he did quite a bit of high humor too.
[07:23.090 --> 07:24.810]  And I mean, that's not easy.
[07:24.810 --> 07:26.890]  I mean, it seems easy to write jokes about pot,
[07:26.890 --> 07:28.250]  but it's, you know.
[07:28.250 --> 07:30.210]  Right, and it has to be, in Denver now,
[07:30.210 --> 07:32.490]  there's a thing where everybody's a pot comic.
[07:32.490 --> 07:34.610]  So you can't be a pot comic.
[07:34.610 --> 07:36.150]  You have to have that.
[07:36.150 --> 07:38.730]  You can throw in your pot set for when the crowd is there.
[07:38.730 --> 07:42.130]  You can't rely on that because it gets old quickly.
[07:42.130 --> 07:43.230]  It wasn't about pot.
[07:43.230 --> 07:45.170]  It was more about the high humor, you know,
[07:45.170 --> 07:46.970]  about being high, kind of,
[07:46.970 --> 07:49.370]  than it was about like, I get my weed for cheap.
[07:50.850 --> 07:52.170]  Deacon Gray, I recommend that dude.
[07:52.170 --> 07:53.010]  Check him out.
[07:53.010 --> 07:54.630]  If you can see him, go see him.
[07:54.630 --> 07:55.470]  I don't know.
[07:55.470 --> 07:56.290]  He might have a website or something.
[07:56.290 --> 07:58.490]  I didn't do any research on that.
[07:58.490 --> 08:00.690]  Also a big shout out to Melissa from Comedy Works.
[08:00.690 --> 08:03.570]  She probably does not have any clue about this podcast,
[08:03.570 --> 08:04.930]  but she made it.
[08:04.930 --> 08:05.770]  You should listen.
[08:05.770 --> 08:06.890]  Yeah, yeah, she should listen.
[08:06.890 --> 08:08.330]  I'll tell her next time I talk to her on the phone,
[08:08.330 --> 08:10.010]  I'll be like, you should listen to my show.
[08:10.010 --> 08:11.250]  But she hooked it up.
[08:11.250 --> 08:12.310]  She made it all worth it.
[08:12.310 --> 08:14.490]  I'll be catching Joe Rogan at Comedy Works next week,
[08:14.490 --> 08:17.290]  and I'll let you guys know how that goes
[08:17.290 --> 08:19.510]  on the next episode.
[08:20.850 --> 08:21.810]  I'm coughing it up over here.
[08:21.810 --> 08:23.050]  We've been taking dabs, guys.
[08:23.050 --> 08:24.610]  Excuse my little miniature pauses.
[08:24.610 --> 08:26.450]  That is not me dying at all.
[08:26.450 --> 08:27.490]  I'm also kind of cold.
[08:28.330 --> 08:31.290]  Left the air on until fucking midnight,
[08:31.290 --> 08:34.130]  and it got like 64 degrees in here.
[08:34.130 --> 08:34.970]  Whoops.
[08:34.970 --> 08:36.090]  What was 60 degrees less anyways?
[08:36.090 --> 08:37.450]  Yeah, it was chilly in here.
[08:37.450 --> 08:39.410]  I've been used to it being like 85, 90,
[08:39.410 --> 08:41.610]  and then I walked up here and it was 60, 64,
[08:41.610 --> 08:42.490]  and I was shivering.
[08:42.490 --> 08:43.410]  It was kind of weird.
[08:43.410 --> 08:45.010]  Anyway, random talk on the show, guys.
[08:45.010 --> 08:46.130]  Sorry.
[08:46.130 --> 08:49.370]  So before we get too far, this is a celebration show,
[08:49.370 --> 08:51.130]  but we have something really awesome
[08:51.130 --> 08:52.270]  to add to this celebration.
[08:52.270 --> 08:56.090]  I'm excited to announce that Mark Emery is home in Canada
[08:56.090 --> 08:58.250]  with his wife, Jodi.
[08:58.250 --> 08:59.330]  Congratulations.
[08:59.330 --> 09:00.930]  That is great.
[09:00.930 --> 09:01.970]  Yeah, if you guys follow the show,
[09:01.970 --> 09:03.330]  you know that Mark Emery was arrested
[09:03.330 --> 09:06.290]  and held in an American federal prison
[09:06.290 --> 09:08.970]  for distributing cannabis seeds across the world.
[09:08.970 --> 09:10.450]  Most listeners of the show would agree
[09:10.450 --> 09:13.090]  that Mark was in prison for complete bullshit,
[09:13.090 --> 09:14.570]  so I think it's great to know that he's back home
[09:14.570 --> 09:16.050]  with his family where he belongs.
[09:16.050 --> 09:18.010]  He's cuddled up with his wife.
[09:18.010 --> 09:20.890]  I saw a picture of him smoking a joint with some people.
[09:20.890 --> 09:23.370]  I saw a picture of him hugging up on his wife.
[09:23.370 --> 09:24.570]  That's what a man should be doing.
[09:24.570 --> 09:26.570]  You shouldn't be locked up.
[09:26.570 --> 09:27.830]  And he's right back on the fight.
[09:27.830 --> 09:30.170]  I don't know if you've watched any video.
[09:30.170 --> 09:31.330]  He's right up there.
[09:31.330 --> 09:34.070]  And I never really noticed that he spoke with a wisp.
[09:34.070 --> 09:36.050]  Maybe he has a retainer or something,
[09:36.050 --> 09:40.290]  but it really was pronounced when he very first stepped back
[09:40.290 --> 09:42.850]  into Canada and got in front of the microphone.
[09:42.850 --> 09:43.690]  I don't remember that.
[09:43.690 --> 09:45.170]  I can link you to the video.
[09:45.170 --> 09:47.250]  I always remember him going on and on for days.
[09:47.250 --> 09:48.690]  Me too, and I mean, that's something
[09:48.690 --> 09:51.130]  that I never really noticed, but he's right back on it,
[09:51.130 --> 09:54.010]  and his wife's running for liberal,
[09:56.250 --> 10:00.650]  some kind of liberal office up there for their stuff
[10:00.650 --> 10:01.930]  to fight the power.
[10:01.930 --> 10:02.770]  Yeah, good, good.
[10:02.770 --> 10:03.610]  It's good to see him back on it.
[10:03.610 --> 10:04.450]  That was quick.
[10:04.450 --> 10:06.730]  So big love and much respect to Mark and Jody Emery.
[10:06.730 --> 10:08.330]  I did a little bit of checking it out.
[10:08.330 --> 10:12.530]  Mark was taken into federal prison on September 10th, 2010.
[10:12.530 --> 10:16.010]  He was released July 9th, 2014.
[10:16.010 --> 10:17.230]  I used Siri.
[10:18.530 --> 10:19.690]  I was gonna say I used a calculator.
[10:19.690 --> 10:21.690]  I just asked Siri how many days was that?
[10:21.690 --> 10:25.970]  That's 1,398 days in federal prison
[10:25.970 --> 10:29.090]  plus the time he was locked up while awaiting trial,
[10:29.090 --> 10:30.250]  the time during the trial,
[10:30.250 --> 10:31.730]  and a couple of weeks in limbo
[10:31.730 --> 10:34.850]  after he was released from federal prison.
[10:34.850 --> 10:38.010]  1,398 days.
[10:39.250 --> 10:40.550]  Adam, you look speechless.
[10:41.570 --> 10:45.010]  Are you familiar with that sort of time period?
[10:45.010 --> 10:46.530]  That's a long, long time, man.
[10:46.530 --> 10:47.810]  That's a long time, dude.
[10:48.530 --> 10:50.610]  I am gonna sound retarded here,
[10:50.610 --> 10:53.410]  but I did three and then 54,
[10:53.410 --> 10:55.650]  and I felt like it was fucking hell.
[10:55.650 --> 10:57.210]  Three days and 54 days?
[10:57.210 --> 10:58.050]  So, yeah.
[10:58.050 --> 10:59.370]  You're a little tiny dude.
[10:59.370 --> 11:00.530]  So, you're not like street tough or nothing?
[11:00.530 --> 11:03.450]  That's some fucking courage and some badassness
[11:03.450 --> 11:05.730]  in that dude, so good job, man.
[11:05.730 --> 11:07.250]  I mean, that's kind of what I was gonna ask
[11:07.250 --> 11:10.450]  is now that he was the prince of pop before he came in,
[11:10.450 --> 11:13.770]  now does he knock Arien off his king throne?
[11:13.770 --> 11:14.610]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:14.610 --> 11:15.450]  Like, you ain't done a lick.
[11:15.450 --> 11:16.770]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:16.810 --> 11:18.090]  I'm not touching that.
[11:18.090 --> 11:20.330]  That's close to four years, though, in federal prison.
[11:20.330 --> 11:23.570]  That's 46 months, 200 weeks.
[11:23.570 --> 11:26.730]  So, imagine your life being disrupted for 200 weeks.
[11:26.730 --> 11:27.570]  You'd be a totally different person.
[11:27.570 --> 11:29.090]  He said he spent his time well.
[11:29.090 --> 11:31.010]  You know, he said he learned the bass guitar
[11:31.010 --> 11:32.450]  and he did a lot of reading.
[11:32.450 --> 11:33.290]  That's awesome, man.
[11:33.290 --> 11:34.570]  So, he learned the bass in prison?
[11:34.570 --> 11:35.410]  That's cool.
[11:35.410 --> 11:37.730]  Mine was in county jail, not federal prison.
[11:37.730 --> 11:39.810]  So, that's a whole nother level even.
[11:39.810 --> 11:43.410]  Like, that's amazing, and I'm glad he's free.
[11:43.410 --> 11:45.170]  That's fucking awesome.
[11:45.170 --> 11:49.050]  He was locked up on, in our opinion, bullshit charges.
[11:49.050 --> 11:49.970]  Bullshit charges.
[11:49.970 --> 11:53.090]  It makes every seed breeder, pot grower,
[11:53.090 --> 11:54.610]  it makes us all a little bit kinda-
[11:54.610 --> 11:56.490]  And not only that, but he was worried about ourselves.
[11:56.490 --> 11:58.210]  Before the rules have changed
[11:58.210 --> 12:00.730]  and now that they've changed, you know,
[12:00.730 --> 12:03.090]  I can just imagine the culture shock.
[12:03.090 --> 12:05.050]  I mean, from where he was Mark Emmer,
[12:05.050 --> 12:06.450]  where he could probably puff on the street
[12:06.450 --> 12:08.250]  anytime he wanted to, but now?
[12:08.250 --> 12:09.730]  In Canada, they don't really seem to care
[12:09.730 --> 12:10.810]  from what people have told me.
[12:10.810 --> 12:12.050]  They're like, come here and smoke weed.
[12:12.050 --> 12:12.890]  We don't really, they don't talk about it.
[12:12.890 --> 12:14.370]  They got bigger problems to fry.
[12:14.410 --> 12:15.890]  Yeah, they don't talk about it like we do.
[12:15.890 --> 12:17.250]  They don't get all hyped about it,
[12:17.250 --> 12:19.650]  but they also don't give a shit about it.
[12:19.650 --> 12:21.770]  All right, so big shout out to Mark Emmer.
[12:21.770 --> 12:23.210]  If you guys are long-time listeners,
[12:23.210 --> 12:24.370]  you know that we actually did,
[12:24.370 --> 12:26.290]  we used to do a portion of the show called Give Thanks,
[12:26.290 --> 12:28.810]  which I will do again in the future,
[12:28.810 --> 12:29.970]  but we've been packing the show.
[12:29.970 --> 12:32.010]  It's been like an hour and 15 minutes sometimes,
[12:32.010 --> 12:33.410]  and I don't feel like we need to stretch it out
[12:33.410 --> 12:35.850]  with another Give Thanks portion once we're that long.
[12:35.850 --> 12:36.850]  So, I'll just wrap it up.
[12:36.850 --> 12:39.610]  So, yeah, welcome home, Mark Emmer.
[12:39.610 --> 12:41.530]  Much love to Jodi Emmer for being strong
[12:41.530 --> 12:43.210]  and keeping herself active in the movement
[12:43.210 --> 12:46.410]  while we were down one soldier.
[12:46.410 --> 12:48.250]  All right, where'd the music go?
[12:48.250 --> 12:49.090]  I don't know.
[12:49.090 --> 12:49.930]  It's right there.
[12:49.930 --> 12:51.370]  Just real quiet.
[12:51.370 --> 12:52.210]  There it is.
[12:52.210 --> 12:53.450]  Task Rock, what's up, Task?
[12:54.410 --> 12:57.570]  So, I need to take one second to make an important,
[12:57.570 --> 13:00.810]  make an, I'm fucking high and stuttering.
[13:00.810 --> 13:03.730]  Let's try that in English, in English this time.
[13:03.730 --> 13:06.250]  I need to make an important announcement.
[13:06.250 --> 13:07.410]  Look, I did it.
[13:07.410 --> 13:09.490]  All the contests we have started on the show
[13:09.490 --> 13:11.170]  will be ending soon.
[13:11.210 --> 13:13.250]  I left a few contests open-ended,
[13:13.250 --> 13:16.210]  and I've been waiting for answers to a few questions
[13:16.210 --> 13:17.410]  and stuff like that.
[13:17.410 --> 13:18.930]  I think those episodes have gotten old
[13:18.930 --> 13:20.330]  and the giveaways have just faded away.
[13:20.330 --> 13:22.170]  So, I want to reuse the prizes.
[13:23.010 --> 13:25.490]  So, I'll end all of the contests that are happening now
[13:25.490 --> 13:28.530]  on the podcast, August 17th at 11.15,
[13:28.530 --> 13:30.730]  59 p.m. Mountain Time.
[13:30.730 --> 13:33.330]  The Jenny Kush prizes and any other unused prizes
[13:33.330 --> 13:35.810]  will be used for future contests and giveaways.
[13:35.810 --> 13:37.330]  So, look forward to that.
[13:37.330 --> 13:39.370]  I just wanted to make an official ending date
[13:39.370 --> 13:42.330]  on those contests so that when I do reuse those prizes,
[13:42.330 --> 13:46.530]  nobody can get mad if they try to go win the old contests.
[13:46.530 --> 13:48.410]  There it is, official shit.
[13:48.410 --> 13:49.250]  All right.
[13:50.930 --> 13:52.330]  So, I do have a Jenny Kush pin
[13:52.330 --> 13:53.650]  and a couple other pins and things
[13:53.650 --> 13:55.730]  that I tried to use in contests before.
[13:55.730 --> 13:58.290]  There'll be a Jenny Kush pin available pretty soon.
[13:58.290 --> 13:59.490]  I need to check the little box.
[13:59.490 --> 14:00.650]  I've got some prizes set aside.
[14:00.650 --> 14:01.690]  We're going to put them back in.
[14:01.690 --> 14:03.250]  Pins are cool, get boys.
[14:03.250 --> 14:04.090]  Get boys?
[14:04.090 --> 14:04.930]  Get boys.
[14:04.930 --> 14:05.770]  You're as high as me, dude.
[14:05.770 --> 14:06.610]  No, I'm not, honestly.
[14:06.610 --> 14:07.450]  That's the problem.
[14:07.450 --> 14:08.290]  Let's get you a couple dabs
[14:08.290 --> 14:09.130]  for saying you're not as high as me.
[14:09.130 --> 14:09.970]  No, you're good.
[14:09.970 --> 14:10.810]  No, it's cool, man.
[14:10.810 --> 14:12.650]  You're on a podcast where we need to-
[14:12.650 --> 14:15.330]  I don't need to speak well, you know what I'm saying?
[14:15.330 --> 14:17.210]  Well, it's a podcast.
[14:17.210 --> 14:18.090]  What are you going to do?
[14:18.090 --> 14:19.930]  You don't look good.
[14:19.930 --> 14:21.690]  Oh, well, yeah, sorry.
[14:21.690 --> 14:24.810]  For all you ladies and gentlemen that were hoping to see me,
[14:24.810 --> 14:25.890]  he's told you where to find me
[14:25.890 --> 14:28.530]  and look at my ugly mug before, so.
[14:28.530 --> 14:29.370]  That's the-
[14:29.370 --> 14:30.210]  Go ahead and dab that.
[14:30.210 --> 14:31.050]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[14:31.050 --> 14:32.010]  That's some Turpex right there.
[14:32.010 --> 14:34.930]  Shout out to the Turpex boys, Jordan and Jordan.
[14:34.930 --> 14:36.970]  Also, big shout out to the Grimey Gatsby.
[14:38.290 --> 14:39.130]  Keep running, Hunt.
[14:39.130 --> 14:40.810]  I want to see you do six miles every morning
[14:40.810 --> 14:42.250]  without fucking getting winded.
[14:42.250 --> 14:43.890]  That's what I want.
[14:43.890 --> 14:46.490]  And my buddy Hunt has quit eating meat,
[14:46.490 --> 14:47.650]  eats fish still.
[14:47.650 --> 14:48.490]  I saw that.
[14:48.490 --> 14:50.330]  And he's cut out, he's addicted to soda,
[14:50.330 --> 14:52.890]  and he's cut out the 23, bro, the Dr. Pepper.
[14:52.890 --> 14:54.130]  He's cut it out of his life.
[14:54.130 --> 14:55.330]  So give him some strength for that.
[14:55.330 --> 14:56.170]  Word.
[14:56.170 --> 14:57.010]  Big shout out.
[14:57.010 --> 14:59.890]  I quit Mountain Dew just for exercising.
[14:59.890 --> 15:01.090]  Yeah, I cut out Mountain Dew.
[15:01.090 --> 15:03.170]  I used to be strongly addicted to Mountain Dew,
[15:03.170 --> 15:04.370]  and I cut that out of my diet,
[15:04.370 --> 15:06.650]  and my body feels better.
[15:06.650 --> 15:07.490]  That was tasty.
[15:07.490 --> 15:08.330]  Do you want another one?
[15:08.330 --> 15:09.170]  No, no, I'm good for a second, but that was tasty.
[15:09.170 --> 15:10.010]  All right, cool.
[15:10.010 --> 15:10.850]  I'm going to take this one right here.
[15:10.850 --> 15:11.690]  You want a dab here?
[15:11.690 --> 15:12.530]  Go for it.
[15:12.530 --> 15:13.370]  Shout out to Turpex, for real.
[15:13.370 --> 15:14.210]  Go for it.
[15:14.210 --> 15:15.050]  If you're handing them out.
[15:15.050 --> 15:15.890]  We're handing out dabs.
[15:15.890 --> 15:16.730]  Shout out to Turpex.
[15:16.730 --> 15:17.570]  That's what we do.
[15:17.570 --> 15:18.410]  You know how we do it here on the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[15:18.410 --> 15:20.650]  I'm a smoker, and that was smooth.
[15:20.650 --> 15:22.810]  Yeah, I think you guys are crazy that smoke cigarettes
[15:22.810 --> 15:25.250]  and still take, are able to take dabs and shit.
[15:25.250 --> 15:26.090]  Oh, yeah.
[15:26.090 --> 15:26.930]  Man.
[15:26.930 --> 15:27.770]  I'm trying, brother.
[15:27.770 --> 15:28.610]  I'm trying to get rid of it.
[15:28.610 --> 15:29.450]  Trust me.
[15:29.450 --> 15:30.290]  It's killing me.
[15:30.290 --> 15:32.050]  Well, you got a nice outdoor harvest coming up.
[15:37.490 --> 15:38.330]  Fucking pouch tobacco.
[15:38.330 --> 15:39.170]  I can't mix it.
[15:39.170 --> 15:39.990]  Well, then just roll some joints,
[15:39.990 --> 15:41.810]  and well, then you'll get your nicotine fit that way,
[15:41.810 --> 15:43.410]  and then just slowly take the nicotine out.
[15:43.410 --> 15:46.450]  I can, like I said, I've done the jail thing.
[15:46.450 --> 15:47.530]  I can just quit.
[15:47.530 --> 15:48.370]  Okay.
[15:48.370 --> 15:51.370]  That's, my problem is her smoking next to me.
[15:51.370 --> 15:53.050]  You know, we both have to quit.
[15:53.050 --> 15:55.850]  And she's not that strong-willed, so.
[15:55.850 --> 15:57.570]  If she doesn't want to quit, then she won't quit.
[15:57.570 --> 15:58.610]  She doesn't want to.
[15:58.610 --> 16:00.130]  So I'm trying to, I've told her,
[16:00.130 --> 16:03.010]  get a pen and just smoke wax, you know?
[16:03.010 --> 16:05.490]  Like, you don't, you don't.
[16:05.490 --> 16:06.330]  Exactly.
[16:06.330 --> 16:07.170]  Exactly.
[16:07.890 --> 16:09.650]  You got a little pen, pulls it out of nowhere.
[16:09.650 --> 16:10.490]  What is that?
[16:10.490 --> 16:13.210]  What's the, you want to say what kind of brand it is,
[16:13.210 --> 16:14.490]  or I don't know if you want to shout it out.
[16:14.490 --> 16:16.770]  Yeah, well, they give him that product to test out,
[16:16.770 --> 16:19.210]  and he doesn't really have a platform to give a review.
[16:19.210 --> 16:20.490]  You're tied up in the headphone cable,
[16:20.490 --> 16:22.530]  so you're going to be stuck for life now.
[16:22.530 --> 16:25.090]  But go ahead and tell him the name of the thing,
[16:25.090 --> 16:28.490]  and then I hit it once, I'll tell you my opinion.
[16:28.490 --> 16:29.330]  It's a Neos.
[16:29.330 --> 16:30.770]  Adam will hit it.
[16:30.770 --> 16:31.890]  I'll shut up so you can talk.
[16:31.890 --> 16:33.430]  The company is Neos.
[16:33.950 --> 16:37.710]  In my opinion, it's an easier draw,
[16:37.710 --> 16:40.070]  and better tasting, and more effective
[16:40.070 --> 16:41.390]  than some of the other companies.
[16:41.390 --> 16:42.230]  It's good.
[16:43.510 --> 16:45.710]  That's an interesting piece.
[16:45.710 --> 16:47.630]  They gave us some samples to try out
[16:47.630 --> 16:50.350]  to see if, you know, we wanted to carry their stuff.
[16:50.350 --> 16:51.750]  They're a fairly new company.
[16:51.750 --> 16:52.590]  Okay.
[16:52.590 --> 16:53.510]  So they're just trying to get their name
[16:53.510 --> 16:54.430]  out there pretty much.
[16:54.430 --> 16:55.750]  A lot of that's going down right now.
[16:55.750 --> 16:57.910]  The battery's a little bit bigger
[16:57.910 --> 17:00.990]  than some of the other companies that are a similar style.
[17:00.990 --> 17:02.670]  So they have strange specifics.
[17:02.670 --> 17:04.030]  You want it to hit.
[17:04.030 --> 17:05.430]  Strange specific cartridges.
[17:05.430 --> 17:06.430]  It's CO2 oil.
[17:06.430 --> 17:07.590]  I don't know if you mentioned that yet.
[17:07.590 --> 17:08.990]  Yeah, CO2 oil.
[17:08.990 --> 17:09.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:10.910 --> 17:13.430]  It's a good product.
[17:13.430 --> 17:14.270]  It is not-
[17:15.390 --> 17:16.230]  It looks really good.
[17:16.230 --> 17:18.550]  Pro level, it's not dab kit dabs,
[17:18.550 --> 17:19.950]  but if you're-
[17:19.950 --> 17:23.390]  If you're looking for a vape pen like this,
[17:23.390 --> 17:24.390]  it's really attractive.
[17:24.390 --> 17:25.950]  Is that-
[17:25.950 --> 17:28.190]  Okay, so you just replace the cartridge on the end.
[17:28.190 --> 17:29.270]  Okay, I see it now.
[17:29.270 --> 17:30.550]  Cool, I was looking for the unscrewy part,
[17:30.550 --> 17:31.470]  but you had your finger right there,
[17:31.470 --> 17:32.310]  and I couldn't tell.
[17:32.830 --> 17:34.190]  It's a USB that attaches to the other end.
[17:34.190 --> 17:35.030]  Cool.
[17:35.030 --> 17:36.670]  And the very end of it is a stylus.
[17:36.670 --> 17:37.870]  What does that cost?
[17:37.870 --> 17:41.030]  If I were a rec patient, what would that cost me?
[17:41.030 --> 17:42.830]  We haven't started carrying them yet,
[17:42.830 --> 17:43.790]  so I'm not sure,
[17:43.790 --> 17:46.070]  but similar companies with smaller batteries,
[17:46.070 --> 17:47.910]  like I said, that aren't as great,
[17:47.910 --> 17:52.470]  a starter package is about $58 and some change.
[17:52.470 --> 17:54.230]  For a small cartridge,
[17:54.230 --> 17:57.910]  just a 150 milligram cartridge and a battery.
[17:57.910 --> 17:59.190]  You don't have to replace the battery.
[17:59.190 --> 18:00.070]  You can recharge it.
[18:00.070 --> 18:02.110]  So you just have to come get cartridges,
[18:02.950 --> 18:04.470]  and they make them in three different sizes,
[18:04.470 --> 18:06.170]  but these ones that were,
[18:06.170 --> 18:07.870]  these new ones that we're testing out,
[18:07.870 --> 18:09.990]  we're probably gonna start carrying those,
[18:09.990 --> 18:12.030]  and I'm not sure what the price will be on those.
[18:12.030 --> 18:13.830]  It'll be similar, definitely.
[18:13.830 --> 18:15.910]  But it's a cool little piece.
[18:15.910 --> 18:17.670]  I noticed a different high.
[18:17.670 --> 18:18.830]  I noticed a different high from it.
[18:18.830 --> 18:19.790]  We've been dabbing for a while,
[18:19.790 --> 18:21.110]  and I just took another rip off that,
[18:21.110 --> 18:22.670]  and my high changed.
[18:22.670 --> 18:23.550]  It got me a little different.
[18:23.550 --> 18:25.030]  So yeah, it's a cool product.
[18:25.030 --> 18:27.950]  It's lemon diesel, this particular cartridge.
[18:27.950 --> 18:30.990]  I'm gonna take a dab of some Terpex, of course.
[18:30.990 --> 18:32.750]  I might have friends that are Terpex.
[18:32.750 --> 18:34.910]  Something may have hooked me up with some hash there.
[18:34.910 --> 18:36.110]  Oh yeah, someone might have.
[18:36.110 --> 18:37.350]  Terpex is badass.
[18:37.350 --> 18:39.910]  Yeah, Jordan, Jordan, Grammy Gatsby.
[18:39.910 --> 18:40.750]  There are more of the guys,
[18:40.750 --> 18:42.910]  but those are the guys I kick with mostly.
[18:42.910 --> 18:43.790]  I'm gonna take this dab.
[18:43.790 --> 18:45.470]  Somebody talk for me for a couple seconds.
[18:45.470 --> 18:48.310]  But no, it's definitely a very attractive case
[18:48.310 --> 18:49.150]  and all that stuff,
[18:49.150 --> 18:50.590]  and that's what I'm talking about.
[18:50.590 --> 18:52.630]  You know, I mean, why not get something like that
[18:52.630 --> 18:56.350]  and fill it full of wax that she'll hit maybe,
[18:56.350 --> 18:58.850]  she probably won't clear the damn thing in a week.
[18:59.850 --> 19:02.490]  That would last your wife a week.
[19:02.490 --> 19:04.010]  Oh, that would last a while, dude.
[19:04.010 --> 19:05.170]  I don't know.
[19:05.170 --> 19:06.730]  Those cartridges are gonna last a bit.
[19:06.730 --> 19:08.930]  I can't say if it will or not,
[19:08.930 --> 19:11.890]  but it's very, it's smooth pull.
[19:11.890 --> 19:12.970]  You don't have to push a button.
[19:12.970 --> 19:13.810]  You know, it's simple.
[19:13.810 --> 19:17.210]  It's, like I said, you wear it with a black shirt.
[19:17.210 --> 19:18.050]  I didn't even see it.
[19:18.050 --> 19:19.610]  You haven't, you know, like.
[19:20.850 --> 19:22.250]  Yeah. All right.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.650]  That was enough of a free shout out.
[19:23.650 --> 19:24.490]  Ha ha ha ha.
[19:24.490 --> 19:27.570]  Ah, I got a message on Facebook
[19:27.610 --> 19:29.850]  from a listener named Fred,
[19:29.850 --> 19:31.330]  and ironically he was asking me
[19:31.330 --> 19:33.770]  to talk about acquiring seeds.
[19:34.690 --> 19:35.530]  It's really great,
[19:35.530 --> 19:36.410]  because this email came today
[19:36.410 --> 19:38.170]  while I was preparing for the show.
[19:39.850 --> 19:41.050]  Sorry, excuse my cough, guys.
[19:41.050 --> 19:42.730]  That's from Dabs.
[19:42.730 --> 19:44.010]  That's from Big Dabs.
[19:44.010 --> 19:47.050]  So I want to talk about acquiring seeds,
[19:47.050 --> 19:48.790]  but before I do that,
[19:48.790 --> 19:51.590]  let me give a little bit of a legal disclaimer,
[19:51.590 --> 19:54.130]  because we don't want to be the next Mark Emory.
[19:54.130 --> 19:54.970]  Okay.
[19:54.970 --> 19:56.810]  It may be illegal to acquire cannabis seeds
[19:56.810 --> 19:58.090]  in your location.
[19:58.090 --> 19:59.730]  It is your responsibility to.
[19:59.730 --> 20:00.570]  Ah.
[20:00.570 --> 20:01.610]  Ha ha ha ha.
[20:01.610 --> 20:02.450]  Awesome.
[20:02.450 --> 20:03.290]  Ha ha ha ha.
[20:03.290 --> 20:04.770]  Let's start that again.
[20:04.770 --> 20:06.770]  I'm not even going to try to edit any of that.
[20:06.770 --> 20:09.250]  It is your responsibility
[20:09.250 --> 20:11.810]  to know the laws in your location.
[20:11.810 --> 20:13.690]  Any company online that will send you seeds
[20:13.690 --> 20:17.370]  is only sending them to you for souvenir purposes.
[20:17.370 --> 20:18.810]  Germinating seeds,
[20:18.810 --> 20:22.690]  germinating cannabis seeds is illegal in most places.
[20:22.690 --> 20:24.170]  I'm not here to help you break the law.
[20:24.170 --> 20:26.890]  If you decide to buy and or germinate cannabis seeds,
[20:26.890 --> 20:28.810]  I cannot be responsible for you.
[20:30.370 --> 20:33.010]  I live in Colorado where cannabis is legalized.
[20:33.010 --> 20:35.210]  So most of my advice is for Colorado,
[20:35.210 --> 20:38.730]  California, Oregon, Washington, or Michigan residents.
[20:38.730 --> 20:40.850]  Be careful and don't get your ass into trouble
[20:40.850 --> 20:43.650]  because I'm not a lawyer and I'm not responsible.
[20:43.650 --> 20:47.290]  I'm simply the host of a bad-ass podcast.
[20:47.290 --> 20:48.770]  That's a cool fucking disclaimer, right?
[20:48.770 --> 20:49.610]  Absolutely.
[20:49.610 --> 20:50.450]  All right.
[20:50.450 --> 20:52.290]  I just had to do that because I don't, I don't,
[20:52.290 --> 20:55.010]  guys, if you're ordering seeds,
[20:55.010 --> 20:58.130]  you must be 18 or 21 and you got to be responsible.
[20:58.130 --> 20:59.170]  You have to be smart.
[21:01.170 --> 21:05.210]  Know the rules where you are in your location.
[21:05.210 --> 21:06.290]  I think they might've used,
[21:06.290 --> 21:07.130]  that's not good.
[21:07.130 --> 21:08.810]  Know the rules in your location.
[21:08.810 --> 21:12.090]  I've used poor grammar, but still do that shit.
[21:12.090 --> 21:13.170]  So now with all that being said,
[21:13.170 --> 21:16.610]  here's what I can tell you about acquiring yourself
[21:16.610 --> 21:19.370]  some seeds, yourself, acquiring some seeds.
[21:20.370 --> 21:22.690]  I like quality seeds from reputable breeders.
[21:24.250 --> 21:25.970]  You guys want to rant on breeders for a minute?
[21:25.970 --> 21:27.050]  Who's some of your favorites?
[21:27.050 --> 21:28.410]  I know who you're going to say, go for it.
[21:28.410 --> 21:29.930]  Say who you are, whoever you want.
[21:29.930 --> 21:32.210]  I mean, I've only heard of a few, you know what I'm saying?
[21:32.210 --> 21:35.530]  TGA's definitely got the respect and TGA's sub-4 seeds.
[21:35.530 --> 21:36.370]  You know what I'm saying?
[21:36.370 --> 21:37.330]  Rare Dankness is definitely great.
[21:37.330 --> 21:38.490]  I respect both of those guys.
[21:38.490 --> 21:40.530]  And of course, you know, Irogenetics, you know?
[21:40.530 --> 21:41.370]  Yeah.
[21:41.370 --> 21:42.210]  Well, they'll be mentioned in here.
[21:42.210 --> 21:43.050]  Okay.
[21:43.050 --> 21:43.890]  That's, that's me, of course.
[21:43.890 --> 21:45.290]  So you don't have to, you don't have to punish me.
[21:45.290 --> 21:46.130]  All right, whatever.
[21:46.130 --> 21:46.970]  You're already here getting dabs.
[21:46.970 --> 21:47.810]  Don't worry about that.
[21:47.810 --> 21:48.650]  Okay, sure.
[21:49.410 --> 21:50.530]  Kelly Connection.
[21:51.610 --> 21:53.490]  Who are you thinking?
[21:53.490 --> 21:55.370]  I'm, I'm honestly a fan.
[21:55.370 --> 21:58.130]  I'm honestly a fan of a lot of the new seed breeders
[21:58.130 --> 21:58.970]  coming out.
[21:58.970 --> 21:59.810]  The new guys?
[21:59.810 --> 22:02.410]  Not to take anything away from some of the old guys
[22:02.410 --> 22:04.650]  who've really paved the way and helped a lot
[22:04.650 --> 22:07.730]  of the new seed breeders get good genetics to breed with.
[22:08.770 --> 22:10.610]  So you can't take anything away from those guys.
[22:10.610 --> 22:14.370]  But I mean, some of the Irogenetics, La Plata Labs,
[22:15.690 --> 22:17.690]  Gage Green Genetics, like they're all doing
[22:17.730 --> 22:19.090]  some really awesome stuff.
[22:19.090 --> 22:21.010]  And they're thinking about what they're crossing
[22:21.010 --> 22:24.010]  and what they're trying to get out of their crosses.
[22:24.010 --> 22:26.610]  And not just finding a good phenotype.
[22:26.610 --> 22:29.610]  They're actually looking for flavor profiles
[22:29.610 --> 22:31.170]  and cannabinoid profiles,
[22:31.170 --> 22:34.570]  and they're getting what they want out of it.
[22:34.570 --> 22:38.210]  And a lot of that has to do with the way they do things.
[22:38.210 --> 22:42.090]  A lot of the new seed breeders are really community friendly
[22:42.090 --> 22:44.690]  and dispersing a lot of seeds to a lot of people
[22:44.690 --> 22:49.250]  and allowing them to perform their methods of growing
[22:49.250 --> 22:53.490]  and find different types of plants.
[22:53.490 --> 22:57.010]  There's an occasional secret meeting at a place in Denver
[22:57.010 --> 23:00.730]  where a few of us are chosen to meet at this mansion.
[23:00.730 --> 23:01.570]  Shout out to the King of Quality.
[23:01.570 --> 23:02.770]  Mile High Seeds?
[23:02.770 --> 23:03.810]  Yeah.
[23:03.810 --> 23:05.810]  Mile High is there, La Plata Labs is there,
[23:05.810 --> 23:08.810]  Sin City goes, Alpha Chronic shows up,
[23:08.810 --> 23:11.250]  a bunch of us breeders, Irogenetics goes,
[23:11.250 --> 23:13.290]  and we all take packages of our newest shit
[23:13.290 --> 23:16.370]  or whatever our secret weapon, and we trade.
[23:16.370 --> 23:21.370]  And Mile High has given me his Apollo Times Brothers Hayes,
[23:22.370 --> 23:24.690]  and I give him my Grateful Dog.
[23:24.690 --> 23:26.970]  Just trade packs of seeds around the table.
[23:26.970 --> 23:30.370]  And we all try to keep it together with each other
[23:30.370 --> 23:31.450]  instead of trying to compete.
[23:31.450 --> 23:32.650]  We're trying to be like, well, here, bro,
[23:32.650 --> 23:36.290]  here's some face-off OG for some heart of gold.
[23:36.290 --> 23:38.530]  Barter, trade.
[23:38.530 --> 23:40.250]  Then you don't need a bank account.
[23:40.250 --> 23:42.050]  That's right, that's right.
[23:42.050 --> 23:44.850]  So that's a few of our favorite breeders.
[23:44.850 --> 23:46.730]  Buy some seeds from reputable breeders.
[23:46.730 --> 23:49.330]  I'm a breeder, I am Irogenetics.
[23:49.330 --> 23:53.290]  I would say, since it's hard to get Irogenetics seeds,
[23:53.290 --> 23:55.170]  Gage Green is one of my favorites.
[23:55.170 --> 23:57.330]  I use Gage Green for breeding stuff.
[23:57.330 --> 23:59.650]  If you want to get into a breeding stuff
[23:59.650 --> 24:00.810]  and you want a reliable male,
[24:00.810 --> 24:02.530]  I can't believe I'm fucking telling the world this,
[24:02.530 --> 24:05.930]  but Gage Green is a good place to find a nice, reliable male.
[24:05.930 --> 24:07.330]  That's true shit right there.
[24:07.330 --> 24:08.630]  That's how friendly I am.
[24:09.930 --> 24:11.050]  But be careful with your breeding
[24:11.050 --> 24:13.290]  because you can still fuck up even with that good male.
[24:13.290 --> 24:14.130]  So much I like you guys.
[24:14.130 --> 24:15.850]  You listen to my show, it's awesome.
[24:17.010 --> 24:19.090]  So bag seeds are fun, but they're not as reliable.
[24:19.090 --> 24:22.770]  Bag seeds are seeds that you find in weed, of course, right?
[24:22.770 --> 24:25.330]  They're not as reliable as something you'd find.
[24:25.330 --> 24:27.770]  You want something with a specific Paris bred
[24:27.770 --> 24:29.690]  for certain traits like Kevin was saying earlier.
[24:29.690 --> 24:31.890]  So it was kind of cool that he touched on that.
[24:31.890 --> 24:33.290]  Your first option is bag seed.
[24:33.290 --> 24:35.030]  That's shit that you of course found in that cush
[24:35.030 --> 24:36.530]  that you bought from that guy in the park
[24:36.530 --> 24:37.410]  and it had a seed in it.
[24:37.410 --> 24:39.090]  Grow that out, see what happens.
[24:39.090 --> 24:40.930]  But keep a close eye on any bag seed
[24:41.810 --> 24:44.170]  because it could be a male or it could be a hermaphrodite.
[24:44.170 --> 24:45.170]  Yep, yep.
[24:45.170 --> 24:47.610]  Adam's got a yard full of herms.
[24:50.450 --> 24:52.250]  So if you're in a legal state,
[24:52.250 --> 24:55.830]  you can possibly get seeds at a dispensary or a co-op.
[24:55.830 --> 24:58.550]  Many of the shops in California, Colorado, Washington,
[24:58.550 --> 25:01.650]  and Michigan have seeds from reputable breeders
[25:01.650 --> 25:04.530]  available on the shelves in the dispensaries.
[25:04.530 --> 25:06.850]  Almost everywhere in the Pacific Northwest
[25:06.850 --> 25:11.850]  has fucking TGA sub cool seeds all over the place.
[25:12.050 --> 25:13.390]  Most of the shops in Colorado,
[25:13.390 --> 25:16.370]  you can pick up yourself some rare dankness.
[25:16.370 --> 25:18.930]  Michigan's got, oddly enough,
[25:18.930 --> 25:21.770]  they've got Gage Green Genetics because our friend Yankee
[25:23.010 --> 25:25.250]  trolls up and down the East Coast there
[25:25.250 --> 25:26.790]  and takes care of them with the Gage Green.
[25:26.790 --> 25:28.170]  He's Gage Green rep and he's awesome.
[25:28.170 --> 25:30.130]  So they're taken care of.
[25:30.130 --> 25:32.410]  So there are seeds on shops and shelves.
[25:32.410 --> 25:33.530]  I was reading, I forgot.
[25:33.530 --> 25:34.370]  There you go.
[25:34.370 --> 25:35.570]  You can also pick up seeds,
[25:35.570 --> 25:38.170]  at cannabis events like the Cannabis Cup and Hemfest
[25:38.170 --> 25:39.750]  or whatever else is happening this month
[25:39.750 --> 25:43.210]  because there seems to be an event every damn month now.
[25:43.210 --> 25:45.250]  The breeders go, they set up a tent,
[25:45.250 --> 25:46.850]  do a little bit of research online,
[25:46.850 --> 25:49.090]  look what you're, find out what you're looking for,
[25:49.090 --> 25:51.290]  find out what you should be paying.
[25:51.290 --> 25:52.830]  Expect to pay about a hundred bucks
[25:52.830 --> 25:55.090]  for a 10 pack of seeds, honestly,
[25:55.090 --> 25:56.890]  between 60 and 120,
[25:56.890 --> 25:58.810]  but about a hundred bucks for a 10 pack of seeds.
[25:58.810 --> 26:01.090]  So before you go to the events,
[26:01.090 --> 26:02.930]  go and find out what you want
[26:02.930 --> 26:04.970]  and then go there and see if you can find those breeders
[26:05.330 --> 26:06.170]  and you'll have a little shopping done.
[26:06.170 --> 26:08.130]  It'll be a little easier for you,
[26:08.130 --> 26:10.570]  but those are only viable options if you live in,
[26:10.570 --> 26:13.210]  or if you can travel to a legal state like Colorado
[26:13.210 --> 26:15.970]  or to Hemfest, which is happening right now.
[26:15.970 --> 26:18.170]  It'll be over by the time you hear this, sorry.
[26:19.450 --> 26:21.070]  That may not be an option for most of you guys.
[26:21.070 --> 26:22.390]  So in this case,
[26:22.390 --> 26:25.370]  you're gonna need to order your seeds online.
[26:25.370 --> 26:27.290]  If you're in the United States,
[26:27.290 --> 26:31.130]  I strongly recommend naturesgreenremedies.com.
[26:31.130 --> 26:32.950]  My company has a great working relationship
[26:32.950 --> 26:34.210]  with Nature's Green Remedies.
[26:34.210 --> 26:35.750]  I'm friends with most of the breeders
[26:35.750 --> 26:37.170]  stocked on Nature's Green Remedies,
[26:37.170 --> 26:39.970]  and I trust everyone that I've done business with
[26:39.970 --> 26:41.850]  involved with Nature's Green Remedies.
[26:41.850 --> 26:44.250]  So I strongly recommend naturesgreenremedies.com
[26:44.250 --> 26:45.970]  for seeds in the US.
[26:45.970 --> 26:48.090]  Like I said, expect to pay around $100
[26:48.090 --> 26:49.450]  for a 10 pack of seeds.
[26:49.450 --> 26:51.650]  Sometimes you get a 12 pack.
[26:51.650 --> 26:53.810]  Some brands are a little cheaper, some are slightly higher.
[26:53.810 --> 26:56.530]  Feminized seeds often run a little more expensive
[26:56.530 --> 26:58.170]  because they're harder to produce.
[26:58.170 --> 27:02.050]  You get way less feminized seeds out of a breeding project
[27:02.050 --> 27:03.330]  than you do regular seeds.
[27:03.330 --> 27:04.890]  It takes more time, it takes more space,
[27:04.890 --> 27:06.370]  it takes more energy.
[27:06.370 --> 27:08.430]  So of course we want more money for that.
[27:08.430 --> 27:10.970]  I do not charge my regular seeds.
[27:10.970 --> 27:12.970]  My feminized seeds are the same price.
[27:12.970 --> 27:15.570]  They charge the same price all the way around.
[27:15.570 --> 27:18.770]  Nature's Green Remedies uses discreet.
[27:18.770 --> 27:19.930]  That's discreet.
[27:19.930 --> 27:21.010]  That means they don't write,
[27:21.010 --> 27:22.690]  these are seeds on the package.
[27:22.690 --> 27:26.710]  Nature's Green Remedies uses discreet priority shipping.
[27:26.710 --> 27:28.690]  And they're right here in the United States.
[27:28.690 --> 27:31.490]  So you know your seeds will arrive in just a few short days.
[27:31.490 --> 27:32.890]  They don't have to pass through customs
[27:33.410 --> 27:34.330]  and get held up.
[27:34.330 --> 27:35.690]  They take all kinds of time.
[27:35.690 --> 27:38.490]  Yeah, America, right here in America.
[27:38.490 --> 27:41.090]  So speaking of Nature's Green Remedies,

[28:16.950 --> 28:18.510]  You got some sign language happening.
[28:18.510 --> 28:19.350]  I wanna know, I feel left out.
[28:19.350 --> 28:21.270]  And his pen got me set back in my seat.
[28:21.270 --> 28:22.110]  No, I don't want it anymore.
[28:22.110 --> 28:23.310]  Nice, so the pen works, that's awesome.
[28:23.310 --> 28:24.150]  Yeah, definitely.
[28:24.150 --> 28:24.970]  I'm glad I got it.
[28:24.970 --> 28:25.810]  I'm trying to signal that.
[28:25.810 --> 28:26.650]  No, that's good, that's good.
[28:26.650 --> 28:27.470]  Okay.
[28:27.470 --> 28:29.310]  I'm just fucking, dude, you had me excited.
[28:30.070 --> 28:30.910]  This ad will wait.
[28:30.910 --> 28:33.150]  I wanted to know what you were doing.
[28:33.150 --> 28:34.190]  This ad will be here.
[28:34.190 --> 28:35.710]  That was interesting watching you do
[28:35.710 --> 28:37.830]  fucking redneck sign language over there.
[28:37.830 --> 28:38.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:38.670 --> 28:39.670]  Nice dude.
[28:39.670 --> 28:40.510]  I was trying to figure out what was happening.
[28:40.510 --> 28:43.190]  It's like giving monkeys tools for the first time.
[28:43.190 --> 28:44.670]  You're like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[28:44.670 --> 28:45.510]  You're fucking.
[28:45.510 --> 28:46.350]  All right.
[28:46.350 --> 28:49.110]  That's fucking great.
[28:49.110 --> 28:50.070]  All right, so here we go.
[28:50.070 --> 28:52.950]  That's not my joke anyway, giving monkeys tools for it.
[28:52.950 --> 28:53.790]  Sure.
[28:53.790 --> 28:54.610]  That's not me.
[28:54.610 --> 28:55.630]  It's like watching monkeys use tools.
[28:55.630 --> 28:57.710]  I don't know where I heard it, but that's not mine.
[28:57.710 --> 28:59.030]  All right, I'm gonna back up.
[28:59.750 --> 29:00.590]  Rewind.

[30:16.630 --> 30:17.630]  because I fucking love you guys.
[30:17.630 --> 30:19.030]  I need a drink right quick, hold on.
[30:19.030 --> 30:20.750]  That is a bad ass deal.
[30:20.750 --> 30:22.870]  And that was a long promo to fucking say
[30:22.870 --> 30:25.070]  without taking a breath or a drink.
[30:25.070 --> 30:26.630]  Arise is the new stuff, right?
[30:28.230 --> 30:29.510]  That's your-
[30:29.510 --> 30:31.590]  It's a golden goat female that was pollinated
[30:31.590 --> 30:34.990]  by a Gage Green Genetics Daybreaker male.
[30:34.990 --> 30:36.830]  Bomb, sounds tasty.
[30:36.830 --> 30:40.630]  It grows, there are phenos that look like the golden goat,
[30:40.630 --> 30:42.350]  there are phenos that look like the Daybreaker
[30:42.350 --> 30:45.110]  and there's one right in the middle, buddy.
[30:45.110 --> 30:46.870]  There's almost no leaf on it.
[30:46.870 --> 30:49.310]  It grows big long fan leaves and no leaf
[30:49.310 --> 30:51.110]  so you don't have to trim it.
[30:51.110 --> 30:51.950]  Darn.
[30:51.950 --> 30:54.350]  And it's some head kicker.
[30:55.230 --> 30:58.750]  All right, so that lasts for one week, you guys.
[30:59.830 --> 31:02.190]  Hopefully I don't run out because I packaged up a bunch.
[31:02.190 --> 31:03.310]  Hopefully I do run out.
[31:03.310 --> 31:04.870]  Hopefully I have to fucking message you guys
[31:04.870 --> 31:07.550]  and be like, I have to give you a 10 pack of something
[31:07.550 --> 31:09.750]  in substitute because you ran me out.
[31:09.750 --> 31:11.550]  I hope that's what happens.

[31:14.510 --> 31:15.830]  or one order per person.
[31:15.830 --> 31:18.270]  Don't try to, it's a freebie, dude.
[31:18.270 --> 31:19.550]  Come on, just be kind with the freebies
[31:19.550 --> 31:20.390]  is what I'm trying to say.
[31:20.390 --> 31:21.270]  Share the wealth.

[31:34.370 --> 31:36.490]  So while we're on this little advertising kick,

[32:54.330 --> 32:55.810]  for making this show possible.
[32:55.810 --> 32:56.970]  Dude, I gotta take another drink.
[32:56.970 --> 32:58.930]  You guys talk about something for a brief moment.
[32:58.930 --> 32:59.970]  Jeez, dude.
[32:59.970 --> 33:01.610]  That's a lot of talking and air going through my head.
[33:01.610 --> 33:02.450]  I'm out of breath.
[33:02.450 --> 33:03.270]  Yeah.
[33:03.270 --> 33:04.110]  I'm out of breath.
[33:04.110 --> 33:05.170]  I try not to bombard you guys with commercials,
[33:05.170 --> 33:06.770]  but we gotta pay the bills.
[33:06.770 --> 33:07.610]  All right.
[33:07.610 --> 33:08.450]  A drink and a damaged message.
[33:08.450 --> 33:09.570]  I love when you message me and you're like,
[33:09.570 --> 33:11.490]  everything was one take.
[33:11.490 --> 33:13.450]  And I'm like, did you breathe through it?
[33:13.450 --> 33:14.290]  You know?
[33:14.290 --> 33:15.210]  Like did you?
[33:15.210 --> 33:17.450]  That's usually my next question is like,
[33:17.450 --> 33:19.170]  did you take a breath?
[33:19.170 --> 33:20.010]  But yeah.
[33:20.010 --> 33:21.450]  Oxygen intake, yes.
[33:21.490 --> 33:23.050]  That's good, man.
[33:23.050 --> 33:25.890]  I'm glad that everything's rolling good with you.
[33:25.890 --> 33:27.170]  It's 25 episodes in, dude.
[33:27.170 --> 33:28.010]  We're getting comfortable.
[33:28.010 --> 33:30.170]  We're learning how to do this shit.
[33:30.170 --> 33:31.410]  So I'm getting there.
[33:31.410 --> 33:33.450]  You guys have endured 25 episodes, man.
[33:33.450 --> 33:35.650]  The first 24, I'm not so sure about.
[33:35.650 --> 33:38.970]  This one is still not even guaranteed to be any good.
[33:38.970 --> 33:39.810]  They're all good, man.
[33:39.810 --> 33:41.850]  You just gotta have faith in your product, bro.
[33:41.850 --> 33:42.690]  I appreciate it.
[33:42.690 --> 33:45.690]  You guys must be liking it because the Facebook,
[33:45.690 --> 33:47.410]  the Instagram, the Twitter, my email,
[33:47.410 --> 33:50.110]  they've all been blowing up lately regarding the show.
[33:50.950 --> 33:52.410]  Man, regarding everything,
[33:52.410 --> 33:55.270]  I read genetics, the podcast, life,
[33:55.270 --> 33:56.870]  everything has been going well.
[33:56.870 --> 33:57.990]  Pretty excited.
[33:57.990 --> 34:00.670]  Good to see you got fish coming up in a few days.
[34:00.670 --> 34:04.230]  I just got tickets for that freaking oddball comedy show.
[34:04.230 --> 34:05.670]  Yeah, I looked at it too.
[34:05.670 --> 34:07.790]  I looked at the prices for those and I was like,
[34:07.790 --> 34:09.750]  yeah, probably not going to that one.
[34:09.750 --> 34:11.710]  You don't get the reserve seating at all.
[34:11.710 --> 34:13.230]  Don't even look at those.
[34:13.230 --> 34:14.790]  Go to the ones underneath those.
[34:14.790 --> 34:15.910]  Okay.
[34:15.910 --> 34:16.750]  All right.
[34:16.750 --> 34:19.230]  63 feet comedy show would be dope.
[34:19.430 --> 34:22.310]  Still 63 is a little bit much for me right now.
[34:22.310 --> 34:23.150]  I agree.
[34:23.150 --> 34:23.990]  I agree.
[34:23.990 --> 34:25.750]  Yeah, gotta pay some bills before that happens.
[34:25.750 --> 34:27.870]  Well, we just paid all the bills here.
[34:27.870 --> 34:28.790]  I got something in my nose.
[34:28.790 --> 34:29.870]  So if I sneeze on the show,
[34:29.870 --> 34:32.670]  it'll be the second time I've ever sneezed on a podcast.
[34:34.030 --> 34:36.270]  This is episode 25 and it feels like a milestone
[34:36.270 --> 34:37.510]  in the podcast world.
[34:37.510 --> 34:39.390]  They say that your show isn't anywhere
[34:39.390 --> 34:41.590]  until you've done 25 episodes.
[34:41.590 --> 34:44.730]  They say don't expect any listener interaction.
[34:44.730 --> 34:45.690]  Don't expect a tweet.
[34:45.690 --> 34:47.190]  Don't expect a comment.
[34:47.190 --> 34:48.950]  Don't expect a five-star review.
[34:49.670 --> 34:50.510]  You're going to be at least until you've gotten
[34:50.510 --> 34:52.310]  25 episodes under your belt.
[34:52.310 --> 34:54.630]  And I do have to give a little bit of respect
[34:54.630 --> 34:57.790]  to the podcast that helped me get my feet wet
[34:57.790 --> 34:59.190]  and learn how to do podcasting.
[34:59.190 --> 35:00.870]  It was 719 the Blocks podcast.
[35:00.870 --> 35:01.950]  No disrespect to those guys.
[35:01.950 --> 35:03.590]  I just had to end that relationship,
[35:03.590 --> 35:05.110]  or not that relationship, that podcast.
[35:05.110 --> 35:06.910]  I didn't have time for that shit anymore.
[35:06.910 --> 35:08.670]  So shout out to those guys.
[35:08.670 --> 35:10.270]  It's kind of where I got my feet wet.
[35:10.270 --> 35:11.710]  And the podcast answer man, dude,
[35:11.710 --> 35:12.550]  you taught me a lot of shit.
[35:12.550 --> 35:13.510]  I know you don't listen to my show,
[35:13.510 --> 35:17.590]  but Cliff Ravenscraft taught me a lot about podcasting.
[35:17.630 --> 35:19.710]  So since we're doing all that,
[35:19.710 --> 35:22.230]  I should send some love to a lot of people.
[35:22.230 --> 35:24.630]  Big shout out to Kevin, of course.

[35:48.390 --> 35:49.390]  Shout out little guys.
[35:49.390 --> 35:51.070]  Burnin' the Crew from High Grove Pueblo,

[36:18.730 --> 36:21.570]  to all of my listeners who have stuck around this long.
[36:21.570 --> 36:22.890]  Finally comfortable on a microphone
[36:22.890 --> 36:25.250]  and I've learned what I'm doing with the recording gear.
[36:25.250 --> 36:27.250]  So stick with me and I'll bring you grow advice
[36:27.250 --> 36:28.450]  and cannabis news every week
[36:28.450 --> 36:31.090]  until they make me freaking stop.
[36:31.090 --> 36:32.150]  I hope I didn't miss anyone.
[36:32.150 --> 36:34.290]  If I did, please know that I love you.
[36:34.290 --> 36:35.850]  Dab the fuck out and I'm on the spot.
[36:35.850 --> 36:38.210]  So it's time to take a celebration dab
[36:38.210 --> 36:39.650]  because episode 25 has gone well.
[36:39.650 --> 36:41.770]  We got the shout outs done, we got the commercials done,
[36:41.770 --> 36:43.530]  we got the contest out.
[36:43.530 --> 36:44.350]  It's time for a dab.
[36:44.350 --> 36:45.770]  I feel good after giving all those people
[36:45.770 --> 36:46.970]  a shout out on the show.
[36:48.250 --> 36:49.090]  That's good, man.
[36:49.090 --> 36:49.930]  That's good.
[36:49.930 --> 36:51.690]  That's a lot of people.
[36:51.690 --> 36:53.050]  That covers most everyone.
[36:53.050 --> 36:54.730]  I wanna give one special shout out
[36:54.730 --> 36:57.930]  to fucking toughest dude I know, Pops, man.
[36:57.930 --> 37:00.130]  He fucking is beating shit and it's awesome.
[37:00.130 --> 37:02.050]  I thought he might show up here tonight for the show.
[37:02.050 --> 37:03.610]  I wasn't sure.
[37:03.610 --> 37:05.090]  But yeah, big shout out to Pops.
[37:05.090 --> 37:07.170]  A big shout out to Joffrey T and Cara Pops.
[37:07.170 --> 37:08.010]  Oh, freaking dude.
[37:08.010 --> 37:09.730]  Pops was really battling some,
[37:09.730 --> 37:11.050]  can we say who Pops was working with?
[37:11.050 --> 37:11.890]  Pops?
[37:11.890 --> 37:12.710]  Yeah.
[37:12.710 --> 37:14.610]  Pops had lung cancer and he looked like hell.
[37:14.610 --> 37:16.650]  Pops looked like a skeleton several months ago.
[37:16.650 --> 37:19.090]  And with the little treatments from his doctor,
[37:19.090 --> 37:19.930]  not little treatments,
[37:19.930 --> 37:21.410]  fucking big ass treatments from his doctor
[37:21.410 --> 37:23.850]  that almost plowed the shit out of Pops,
[37:23.850 --> 37:26.010]  and the love from Kevin and the nurturing from Kevin
[37:26.010 --> 37:27.870]  and also the help of cannabis,
[37:27.870 --> 37:30.650]  Pops looks like a freaking million bucks now, man.
[37:30.650 --> 37:33.050]  The help from Jeff and Irie
[37:33.050 --> 37:34.770]  and the whole cannabis community, man.
[37:34.770 --> 37:38.690]  There were a lot of people who gave free donations
[37:38.690 --> 37:39.850]  just to help out his cause
[37:39.850 --> 37:42.050]  because he couldn't smoke anymore and things like that.
[37:42.050 --> 37:43.050]  So that's what it's about.
[37:43.050 --> 37:44.210]  Really, you know,
[37:44.210 --> 37:46.830]  he gained weight throughout his entire treatment.
[37:46.830 --> 37:50.690]  The only bad news we received was the original cancer.
[37:50.690 --> 37:54.610]  So cannabis has done a lot for the man.
[37:54.610 --> 37:56.170]  He's made sure he could eat
[37:56.170 --> 38:00.650]  and kept him going through all those hard treatments.
[38:00.650 --> 38:02.770]  And we're just waiting on the scan next month
[38:02.770 --> 38:04.350]  to see what the final answer is.
[38:04.350 --> 38:06.770]  But he says he has more energy.
[38:06.770 --> 38:09.690]  He feels better than he has in over three years.
[38:09.690 --> 38:11.970]  So, I mean, he looks better.
[38:11.970 --> 38:14.450]  He's, it's awesome.
[38:14.450 --> 38:15.770]  Take care of yourselves, guys.
[38:15.770 --> 38:18.290]  Thank, I have to thank the community for that
[38:18.290 --> 38:22.650]  because very little came from me, to be quite honest.
[38:22.650 --> 38:25.890]  I bought what I could, but I was limited as well.
[38:25.890 --> 38:28.330]  And I got a lot of free things from a lot of good people
[38:28.330 --> 38:29.490]  and I appreciate that.
[38:30.370 --> 38:32.290]  That's what this community is for.
[38:32.290 --> 38:33.810]  As growers and breeders, we,
[38:33.810 --> 38:35.650]  if you're doing it right, you do okay.
[38:35.650 --> 38:37.010]  So we got to pay it forward.
[38:37.010 --> 38:38.250]  We got to kick it down.
[38:38.250 --> 38:39.370]  I hope you guys noticed that shit.
[38:39.370 --> 38:40.810]  We try not to be stingy.
[38:40.810 --> 38:42.370]  And I mean, I've only been here a couple of months
[38:42.370 --> 38:44.530]  and let me just say that it's one thing hearing about it,
[38:44.530 --> 38:48.170]  you know, from internet and other sources
[38:48.170 --> 38:49.730]  and things like that, but seeing it for yourself,
[38:49.730 --> 38:50.570]  it's great, man.
[38:50.570 --> 38:53.650]  Like it's, what he's speaking is the truth out here.
[38:53.650 --> 38:54.490]  You know what I'm saying?
[38:54.490 --> 38:55.310]  It's-
[38:55.310 --> 38:57.410]  I have to give a huge thanks to Joey
[38:57.410 --> 39:00.130]  from Natural Mystic Caregivers and Selecta Nikiti.
[39:00.130 --> 39:03.050]  Both, they fucking hooked it up with oil capsules
[39:03.050 --> 39:04.770]  that went directly to him.
[39:04.770 --> 39:05.610]  And I mean-
[39:05.610 --> 39:06.610]  The essential caps, right?
[39:06.610 --> 39:08.330]  Yeah, the essential caps.
[39:08.330 --> 39:09.890]  I've heard a lot of good things about those.
[39:09.890 --> 39:11.610]  They don't pay me to say this.
[39:11.610 --> 39:12.730]  I have paid sponsors.
[39:12.730 --> 39:13.570]  No, not at all.
[39:13.570 --> 39:14.390]  The essential caps didn't pay anything.
[39:14.390 --> 39:16.010]  I've heard a lot of good things about those.
[39:16.010 --> 39:18.250]  And the Mystic caps from Joey,
[39:18.250 --> 39:20.970]  I ran into him just walking, leaving actually.
[39:20.970 --> 39:24.010]  I ran into him right in the middle of two places
[39:24.010 --> 39:25.650]  and I kind of told him how I was doing
[39:25.650 --> 39:27.970]  and he asked about my dad because he had met him before.
[39:27.970 --> 39:30.370]  And I told him and he reached in his bag
[39:30.370 --> 39:32.010]  and gave me some of those Mystic caps
[39:32.010 --> 39:34.530]  that won the Cannabis Cup award recently.
[39:34.530 --> 39:35.370]  Just give, man.
[39:35.370 --> 39:37.350]  And just here, like give these to your dad.
[39:37.350 --> 39:38.190]  I did.
[39:38.870 --> 39:40.190]  It's just been amazing,
[39:40.190 --> 39:42.390]  the love and support I've gotten from everybody
[39:42.390 --> 39:45.230]  and the love that's gone to him.
[39:45.230 --> 39:46.070]  It's awesome.
[39:46.070 --> 39:47.150]  The community really works like that, man.
[39:47.150 --> 39:48.550]  If you show it love, it does.
[39:48.550 --> 39:49.550]  It gives you love back.
[39:49.550 --> 39:50.490]  It really does.
[39:51.670 --> 39:53.510]  I had another friend,
[39:53.510 --> 39:55.510]  I don't know if he wants me to shout him out on a podcast,
[39:55.510 --> 39:57.670]  but a friend of a friend came down
[39:57.670 --> 40:00.270]  with stage four liver cancer and was in deep shit.
[40:01.270 --> 40:03.190]  Actually looked worse than pops looked
[40:03.190 --> 40:04.670]  and I'm not trying to level any shit,
[40:04.670 --> 40:06.370]  but the only thing that was gonna work for this cat
[40:06.370 --> 40:07.690]  was RSO.
[40:07.690 --> 40:08.850]  And I posted on Facebook,
[40:08.850 --> 40:11.610]  I need some RSO and I got it within five days.
[40:11.610 --> 40:12.450]  I remember that.
[40:12.450 --> 40:13.370]  That's awesome.
[40:13.370 --> 40:14.970]  It delivered from Leadville.
[40:14.970 --> 40:17.970]  That's like fucking eight or nine hours away from here.
[40:17.970 --> 40:19.810]  To just a friend of a friend who-
[40:19.810 --> 40:21.610]  That's compassionate care right there.
[40:21.610 --> 40:22.450]  You know?
[40:22.450 --> 40:23.270]  They knew it wasn't for me.
[40:23.270 --> 40:25.130]  They knew that that was for that guy.
[40:25.130 --> 40:25.970]  I wasn't asking for it.
[40:25.970 --> 40:27.730]  And they're like, yeah, we got it, man.
[40:27.730 --> 40:28.570]  Hooked him up.
[40:28.570 --> 40:30.290]  So if you hooked up somebody,
[40:30.290 --> 40:32.130]  if anybody out there, this shout out's for you.
[40:32.130 --> 40:33.490]  If you hook up medical patients,
[40:33.490 --> 40:35.530]  if you don't charge your medical patients,
[40:35.530 --> 40:36.890]  if you give medical patients extra,
[40:36.890 --> 40:38.290]  I know you got to recoup your light fees.
[40:38.290 --> 40:39.250]  You got to pay for your soil.
[40:39.250 --> 40:40.850]  You got to do that shit.
[40:40.850 --> 40:42.970]  So charge them the bare minimum.
[40:42.970 --> 40:45.850]  If you guys are hooking up cancer patients with RSO,
[40:45.850 --> 40:46.770]  if you're doing that kind of shit,
[40:46.770 --> 40:48.410]  you know who you are if you deserve a shout out
[40:48.410 --> 40:49.290]  for this shit.
[40:49.290 --> 40:50.130]  Big ups.
[40:50.130 --> 40:52.170]  If you're a medical provider, big love, respect.
[40:52.170 --> 40:53.010]  Thank you.
[40:53.010 --> 40:53.830]  That's a shout out for you.
[40:53.830 --> 40:55.250]  You guys don't get enough attention paid to you.
[40:55.250 --> 40:56.530]  You don't get enough love.
[40:57.650 --> 40:58.850]  Some of you guys are just balling out,
[40:58.850 --> 41:00.130]  looking like gangsters,
[41:00.130 --> 41:01.290]  living off the caregiver life.
[41:01.290 --> 41:04.090]  But some of you guys are doing it proper
[41:04.130 --> 41:05.210]  and mad love for that
[41:05.210 --> 41:07.650]  because it's hard to do it proper.
[41:07.650 --> 41:10.210]  Growing that medical grade herb with no sprays,
[41:10.210 --> 41:12.910]  no crazy shit on it is definitely a challenge.
[41:14.610 --> 41:15.450]  All right.
[41:15.450 --> 41:16.850]  That's crazy stuff, man.
[41:16.850 --> 41:18.330]  I want to keep the grow lessons coming and shit
[41:18.330 --> 41:20.050]  and always do episodes with news.
[41:20.050 --> 41:22.610]  If you guys want to hear me talk about something,
[41:22.610 --> 41:24.610]  something random, something like this guy,
[41:24.610 --> 41:26.970]  the whole seed topic today just happened to be good timing.
[41:26.970 --> 41:28.690]  I had a giveaway planned
[41:28.690 --> 41:30.890]  and that guy asked about where to get seeds.
[41:30.890 --> 41:33.090]  So now hopefully he's listening to episode 25
[41:33.090 --> 41:34.610]  and he can get seeds.
[41:34.610 --> 41:36.050]  He knows the laws and regulations.
[41:36.050 --> 41:37.330]  He doesn't even have to buy
[41:37.330 --> 41:39.090]  some iRegenetics products right now.
[41:39.090 --> 41:41.250]  I think his email said he's in California.
[41:41.250 --> 41:42.610]  So he's cool to grow herb.
[41:42.610 --> 41:43.650]  Great.
[41:43.650 --> 41:46.170]  He's got that 215 and it's legal out there.
[41:46.170 --> 41:47.010]  Good deal.
[41:47.010 --> 41:49.890]  But he doesn't have to even buy iRegenetics products.
[41:49.890 --> 41:54.170]  He can go buy some rare dankness or some La Plata,
[41:54.170 --> 41:56.930]  some Durango OG if they've got that shit in stock.
[41:56.930 --> 41:57.750]  What was that?
[41:57.750 --> 41:59.970]  That alien, lemon alien?
[41:59.970 --> 42:00.810]  Lemon alien.
[42:00.810 --> 42:02.690]  I'm not sure if that's available anywhere.
[42:03.330 --> 42:05.570]  I don't know if it's available, but it looked ridiculous.
[42:05.570 --> 42:09.010]  Or a Gage Green Genetics, Scarlet Kush or Scarlet Kush
[42:09.010 --> 42:09.850]  or Asperare.
[42:09.850 --> 42:11.050]  I'm trying not to call.
[42:11.050 --> 42:12.530]  Oh, there it was.
[42:12.530 --> 42:13.530]  Okay, I'm better now.
[42:13.530 --> 42:15.210]  I should have just let it happen.
[42:15.210 --> 42:19.010]  But go get some of those and then use that coupon code,
[42:19.010 --> 42:21.450]  episode 25, it's all one word, capital E
[42:21.450 --> 42:24.410]  and then the number 25, episode 25.
[42:25.850 --> 42:29.130]  You get a free five pack of iRegener and I don't want
[42:29.130 --> 42:31.210]  anything except your loyal listenership,
[42:31.210 --> 42:32.890]  which is pretty awesome.
[42:32.890 --> 42:33.730]  Yep.
[42:33.730 --> 42:36.050]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:36.050 --> 42:37.490]  So if you wanna hear me talk about some shit,
[42:37.490 --> 42:39.530]  just tweet me, message me, I'll talk about it.
[42:39.530 --> 42:42.050]  We'll discuss it, we'll talk about it on the show.
[42:43.290 --> 42:44.650]  Let's see, let's see.
[42:44.650 --> 42:46.250]  I've learned what I'm doing with recording gear.
[42:46.250 --> 42:47.090]  I knew that part.
[42:47.090 --> 42:47.930]  Where am I?
[42:47.930 --> 42:49.050]  I missed, I lost my fucking,
[42:49.050 --> 42:50.050]  somebody point to this paper
[42:50.050 --> 42:51.850]  and I'll just start reading there.
[42:51.850 --> 42:53.290]  I'm not really sure where you were on that paper.
[42:53.290 --> 42:54.410]  All right, well, you can message me
[42:54.410 --> 42:55.890]  at agroculture on hotmail.com
[42:55.890 --> 42:57.530]  or you can tweet me at agroculture
[42:57.530 --> 43:00.370]  or you can find me on Facebook under agroculture.
[43:00.490 --> 43:02.810]  If you don't want me to say your name on the show,
[43:02.810 --> 43:04.250]  just let me know in your message
[43:04.250 --> 43:05.450]  and I'll keep your identity private.
[43:05.450 --> 43:08.170]  I know that I gotta keep some people in Texas and Oklahoma.
[43:08.170 --> 43:09.890]  I can't let anybody know they're growing and shit.
[43:09.890 --> 43:12.330]  So I won't bust you out.
[43:12.330 --> 43:14.090]  If you leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher,
[43:14.090 --> 43:16.290]  I'll try to read those on a future episode.
[43:17.410 --> 43:21.010]  Big shout out to TaskRock for the song that's playing.
[43:21.010 --> 43:21.930]  We got a couple minutes to kill.
[43:21.930 --> 43:23.930]  You guys got a topic you wanna bring up?
[43:25.290 --> 43:26.610]  You had a couple topics earlier.
[43:26.610 --> 43:27.530]  Oh yeah, bro.
[43:28.450 --> 43:33.450]  Colorado Springs has banned the use of butane extraction.
[43:33.450 --> 43:34.290]  As far as I know-
[43:34.290 --> 43:37.210]  You're gonna celebrate the banning of butane extraction
[43:37.210 --> 43:38.810]  by taking a fat, chunky dad?
[43:38.810 --> 43:39.730]  Is that what you're gonna do?
[43:39.730 --> 43:41.850]  I asked, honestly.
[43:41.850 --> 43:42.770]  That's gonna happen.
[43:42.770 --> 43:44.010]  Okay.
[43:44.010 --> 43:44.890]  Go for your thing, Kevin.
[43:44.890 --> 43:46.450]  There's not a lot of details on it.
[43:46.450 --> 43:47.290]  I'll turn Adams on my dog.
[43:47.290 --> 43:50.170]  There's not a lot to say about it.
[43:50.170 --> 43:53.570]  However, for those who haven't caught the message yet,
[43:54.570 --> 43:59.570]  Colorado Springs has put a moratorium on butane extraction,
[44:00.130 --> 44:02.410]  including in a closed loop system.
[44:02.410 --> 44:04.130]  And under all these new regulations
[44:04.130 --> 44:07.010]  that have been put on the extraction labs-
[44:07.010 --> 44:09.450]  Can you dumb that down just a little bit?
[44:09.450 --> 44:11.050]  Like I don't really understand.
[44:11.050 --> 44:12.810]  So they're saying no more blasting?
[44:12.810 --> 44:13.770]  Yeah, pretty much.
[44:13.770 --> 44:14.610]  Exactly.
[44:14.610 --> 44:16.690]  You can't do it open, which are the new regulations.
[44:16.690 --> 44:18.130]  You have to have closed loop system
[44:18.130 --> 44:19.810]  and a certain type of environment
[44:20.730 --> 44:23.010]  under certain code and things like that.
[44:23.810 --> 44:28.810]  But now they're outlawing even that in Colorado Springs.
[44:28.970 --> 44:33.970]  And apparently what it was is one guy from,
[44:35.130 --> 44:39.410]  I forget his name, from some building department
[44:39.410 --> 44:41.130]  or something in Springs,
[44:43.090 --> 44:46.450]  kinda decided that these electrical codes
[44:46.450 --> 44:48.930]  and certain things were not sufficient
[44:48.930 --> 44:52.650]  to even have a closed loop system in.
[44:52.650 --> 44:54.970]  So here the industry is,
[44:54.970 --> 44:59.210]  there's a lot of people making new rooms and everything
[44:59.210 --> 45:03.450]  under all these new codes that follow all these guidelines.
[45:03.450 --> 45:07.410]  And this guy just came in and said that wasn't good enough.
[45:07.410 --> 45:10.450]  And apparently this department has like final say
[45:10.450 --> 45:13.810]  over fire department and all this other stuff.
[45:13.810 --> 45:15.250]  So-
[45:15.250 --> 45:16.810]  If you guys hear that cough in the background,
[45:16.810 --> 45:18.330]  that's Adam being a big sissy.
[45:19.570 --> 45:22.410]  So they're working to figure it out
[45:23.170 --> 45:26.850]  and I think the guy from what I understand
[45:26.850 --> 45:31.330]  is going to tell the industry
[45:31.330 --> 45:34.490]  what he wants as his regulations or whatever.
[45:34.490 --> 45:39.490]  And it may be like the video I saw,
[45:39.490 --> 45:42.210]  they said it may be a week,
[45:42.210 --> 45:44.610]  it may be a year before this is fixed.
[45:44.610 --> 45:46.330]  You just never know with this stuff.
[45:46.330 --> 45:49.410]  And it's just happened yesterday afternoon.
[45:49.410 --> 45:50.250]  So that's-
[45:50.490 --> 45:51.810]  How many extraction-
[45:52.690 --> 45:55.730]  So this is open blasting
[45:55.730 --> 45:57.370]  is actually technically illegal anyway.
[45:57.370 --> 46:00.250]  This is only relating to dispensary OPC grows.
[46:00.250 --> 46:03.290]  So state regulated, MED regulated grows
[46:03.290 --> 46:04.530]  that are blasting their products.
[46:04.530 --> 46:06.010]  Not even blasting anymore at this point,
[46:06.010 --> 46:08.650]  it's processing in a closed loop system.
[46:08.650 --> 46:12.370]  How many of those legal MED regulated MIPS,
[46:12.370 --> 46:14.930]  OPC regulated blasting sites,
[46:14.930 --> 46:17.090]  processing facilities, I guess we'll call them.
[46:17.090 --> 46:18.090]  How many of those do you think
[46:18.090 --> 46:20.450]  or know of in Colorado Springs?
[46:20.450 --> 46:23.130]  I know of two for sure.
[46:23.130 --> 46:25.610]  I know there's probably a couple more
[46:25.610 --> 46:28.610]  just because some of the dispensaries
[46:28.610 --> 46:31.050]  have their own MIPS license
[46:31.050 --> 46:33.010]  and stuff that they can process under.
[46:33.010 --> 46:35.370]  But I know two of for sure,
[46:35.370 --> 46:37.730]  and one's fairly new to Colorado.
[46:37.730 --> 46:40.010]  And that's kind of a bummer.
[46:41.330 --> 46:44.450]  Because they just spent a lot of money building their-
[46:44.490 --> 46:47.410]  They just popped for licensing and everything.
[46:47.410 --> 46:51.570]  And it's getting shut down now, which is, you know, that's-
[46:51.570 --> 46:53.370]  They can still run their garden, but they can't.
[46:53.370 --> 46:54.610]  They can't extract it.
[46:54.610 --> 46:56.890]  With butane, you can still run CO2,
[46:56.890 --> 47:00.330]  you can still run water.
[47:00.330 --> 47:01.170]  But-
[47:01.170 --> 47:03.090]  So can the garden that we're talking about,
[47:03.090 --> 47:06.370]  okay, a garden in Springs that was actually being grown.
[47:06.370 --> 47:08.290]  So what happens guys, if you're listening from,
[47:08.290 --> 47:10.530]  we've got a listener that listens in London.
[47:10.530 --> 47:11.370]  Like, so we have to keep in mind that-
[47:11.370 --> 47:12.210]  Respect, dude.
[47:12.210 --> 47:13.250]  Yeah, thank you.
[47:13.290 --> 47:14.770]  So we have to keep in mind that not everybody-
[47:14.770 --> 47:15.610]  My mic sounds funny.
[47:15.610 --> 47:16.850]  Okay, it's just the music.
[47:16.850 --> 47:17.690]  We have to keep in mind
[47:17.690 --> 47:19.970]  that not everybody knows Colorado shit.
[47:19.970 --> 47:24.730]  These places grow a large garden, like a thousand plants,
[47:24.730 --> 47:26.450]  and they harvest the entire garden.
[47:26.450 --> 47:28.170]  And then they run all of that
[47:28.170 --> 47:31.210]  through a closed loop butane extraction machine
[47:31.210 --> 47:36.210]  and turn all of it into hash, into BHO, dabs, shatter-
[47:36.530 --> 47:37.370]  Processed-
[47:37.370 --> 47:38.490]  Wire wanna concentrate.
[47:38.490 --> 47:39.330]  Yes.
[47:39.330 --> 47:42.210]  And that sells for somewhere between,
[47:42.250 --> 47:43.890]  depending on where and who,
[47:43.890 --> 47:46.330]  between 30 and 60 a gram.
[47:46.330 --> 47:47.730]  And if you're getting into live resin,
[47:47.730 --> 47:50.170]  it's 85 to $100 a gram.
[47:50.170 --> 47:52.850]  So these guys are making large portions
[47:52.850 --> 47:56.210]  and portioning it up into grams.
[47:56.210 --> 47:58.330]  And then they deliver it back to the dispensary
[47:58.330 --> 48:00.010]  and then the dispensary sells it.
[48:00.010 --> 48:01.930]  Or the dispensary takes their grow
[48:01.930 --> 48:03.290]  that they have leftovers of
[48:03.290 --> 48:04.970]  and sends it to the extraction company
[48:04.970 --> 48:07.650]  for them to blast or process.
[48:07.650 --> 48:10.450]  And then they take all of that product back to the shop
[48:10.450 --> 48:11.750]  and sell it on the shelves.
[48:12.290 --> 48:14.230]  So these guys are growing large, large gardens
[48:14.230 --> 48:15.630]  just for processing.
[48:15.630 --> 48:17.470]  So what I see them doing,
[48:17.470 --> 48:20.270]  you run your large garden, you chop it, you dry it,
[48:20.270 --> 48:22.510]  you drive it up to Denver to your processing facility
[48:22.510 --> 48:24.550]  or down to Pueblo to your processing facility
[48:24.550 --> 48:26.710]  where it's legal, and then you run it there
[48:26.710 --> 48:28.610]  and then you just have to drive twice.
[48:30.150 --> 48:30.990]  Yeah, pretty much.
[48:30.990 --> 48:33.870]  So this is forcing closed loop systems, correct?
[48:33.870 --> 48:35.430]  Well, closed loops have been banned also
[48:35.430 --> 48:37.550]  in Colorado Springs as part of this moratorium.
[48:37.550 --> 48:38.510]  But the closed loop system
[48:38.510 --> 48:40.030]  is what the industry standard is now.
[48:40.030 --> 48:41.430]  You cannot blast open loop.
[48:42.310 --> 48:45.950]  Is this not doing anything but upgrading the hash?
[48:45.950 --> 48:48.350]  I mean, it kind of sounds negative
[48:48.350 --> 48:49.510]  when it's coming from YouTube,
[48:49.510 --> 48:51.070]  but to me it sounds like more people
[48:51.070 --> 48:52.630]  are gonna be making unicorn hash
[48:52.630 --> 48:54.230]  and we're gonna go away from the butane nasty-
[48:54.230 --> 48:55.070]  Well, they just banned,
[48:55.070 --> 48:56.830]  you can't even make unicorn hash now,
[48:56.830 --> 48:57.990]  which is a live resin, you guys.
[48:57.990 --> 48:58.830]  Sorry, we'll just call it-
[48:58.830 --> 48:59.650]  Not in Colorado Springs.
[48:59.650 --> 49:01.790]  Yeah, you can't do any of it in Colorado Springs.
[49:01.790 --> 49:03.510]  It's gonna drive the black market hash.
[49:03.510 --> 49:04.350]  Exactly.
[49:04.350 --> 49:08.370]  Now guys that are unlicensed, like me,
[49:08.370 --> 49:10.110]  I'm a grower and I'm a breeder.
[49:10.510 --> 49:11.590]  I don't know how to make the dabs.
[49:11.590 --> 49:13.430]  Honestly, I let other people do that for me,
[49:13.430 --> 49:14.830]  but I'm going to have to,
[49:14.830 --> 49:16.090]  if I live in Colorado Springs,
[49:16.090 --> 49:18.210]  I can't get it now because it's not being made.
[49:18.210 --> 49:19.830]  I'm going to have to go in my backyard
[49:19.830 --> 49:21.690]  and open blast my own product,
[49:21.690 --> 49:24.190]  which is kind of taking it back to where it was
[49:24.190 --> 49:26.430]  that caused a lot of the problems in the first place.
[49:26.430 --> 49:29.110]  Yep, but that's what prohibition does.
[49:29.110 --> 49:29.950]  I mean-
[49:29.950 --> 49:30.790]  It goes back and forth.
[49:30.790 --> 49:34.230]  Yeah, they're just trying to re-prohibit prohibition.
[49:34.230 --> 49:37.470]  Yeah, Colorado Springs is kind of a strange city anyway.
[49:37.470 --> 49:38.430]  For being such a big city,
[49:38.430 --> 49:40.550]  they've banned all the recreational cannabis.
[49:40.550 --> 49:41.990]  Now they're banning blasting.
[49:42.870 --> 49:44.670]  Yeah, there's a lot of military up there.
[49:44.670 --> 49:48.570]  Do you want to mention the event being pushed back or?
[49:48.570 --> 49:49.410]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:49.410 --> 49:50.550]  Oh yeah, yeah, we got to talk about that.
[49:50.550 --> 49:52.670]  Big shout out to Daniel for making this decision.
[49:52.670 --> 49:53.510]  Secret Cup Mountain Region, man.
[49:53.510 --> 49:54.710]  And yeah, big up to him.
[49:54.710 --> 49:56.990]  I don't know if anybody is mad about it.
[49:56.990 --> 49:58.430]  I haven't heard any bad reviews on this decision.
[49:58.430 --> 49:59.870]  I haven't seen anything on it either.
[49:59.870 --> 50:01.390]  I think it's a great idea.
[50:01.390 --> 50:04.470]  He pushed the Mountain Region back.
[50:04.470 --> 50:07.750]  I'm sure it was a community decision to some extent.
[50:08.110 --> 50:08.950]  It wasn't just Big D going,
[50:08.950 --> 50:10.830]  no, I'm fucking doing this.
[50:10.830 --> 50:11.670]  That's just not how he does.
[50:11.670 --> 50:13.310]  I feel like doing it tomorrow.
[50:13.310 --> 50:17.310]  But no, they had just wrapped up the East Coast.
[50:17.310 --> 50:18.310]  The Beast Coast.
[50:18.310 --> 50:19.150]  Beast Coast?
[50:19.150 --> 50:20.270]  Shout out to Bobby Nugs.
[50:20.270 --> 50:21.670]  Apparently that was badass.
[50:21.670 --> 50:22.490]  Good job, dude.
[50:22.490 --> 50:23.330]  I watched the video on it.
[50:23.330 --> 50:24.150]  Good job.
[50:24.150 --> 50:25.590]  They had some pretty high numbers
[50:25.590 --> 50:26.410]  and some pretty high-
[50:26.410 --> 50:28.270]  So after that, you know,
[50:28.270 --> 50:30.950]  Secret Cup administrators decided that
[50:31.870 --> 50:33.910]  they needed to make Colorado the home state.
[50:33.910 --> 50:35.470]  Secret Cup administrators.
[50:35.470 --> 50:36.310]  Yeah.
[50:36.310 --> 50:37.270]  So Big D and Jeremy?
[50:37.790 --> 50:38.630]  Yeah.
[50:38.630 --> 50:39.470]  Okay.
[50:39.470 --> 50:42.830]  As badass as the Beast Coast was, you know?
[50:42.830 --> 50:45.950]  And they didn't feel like they could do that
[50:45.950 --> 50:48.230]  within like a week and a half.
[50:48.230 --> 50:50.670]  And they have had several venue changes,
[50:50.670 --> 50:52.790]  several issues with Denver.
[50:52.790 --> 50:53.630]  Yeah.
[50:53.630 --> 50:54.990]  And the venues they could get locked down.
[50:54.990 --> 50:57.350]  So they finally have a good venue locked down
[50:57.350 --> 50:59.670]  and they're getting everything else squared away.
[50:59.670 --> 51:02.210]  And they pushed it back to the end of September.
[51:03.590 --> 51:04.830]  And so it's still happening
[51:04.870 --> 51:07.510]  and they want to just make it badass and not half-ass.
[51:07.510 --> 51:10.510]  So good job on that decision for sure.
[51:10.510 --> 51:12.150]  Maybe they think that'll leave more time
[51:12.150 --> 51:13.110]  for people to get ready.
[51:13.110 --> 51:16.350]  Also, Big D offered to pay any expenses
[51:16.350 --> 51:19.150]  that were extra incurred on people
[51:19.150 --> 51:21.750]  who had already had plane tickets
[51:21.750 --> 51:23.750]  that had to trade a man or anything like that.
[51:23.750 --> 51:25.670]  Like he had posted right on Facebook
[51:25.670 --> 51:28.070]  that said just prove to me what you're out
[51:28.070 --> 51:29.270]  and I'll take care of it.
[51:29.270 --> 51:31.830]  Like if you need to back out of the competition
[51:31.830 --> 51:32.870]  or whatever, I understand.
[51:32.870 --> 51:33.710]  No big deal.
[51:33.710 --> 51:35.430]  I can refund that.
[51:35.430 --> 51:39.590]  So I mean, he offered to fucking pay airline fees
[51:39.590 --> 51:41.830]  for changing tickets if there were, you know.
[51:41.830 --> 51:42.670]  That's awesome.
[51:42.670 --> 51:44.990]  And I was like, that's pretty cool, dude.
[51:44.990 --> 51:45.830]  It's a good man.
[51:45.830 --> 51:47.270]  Big D, shout out Big D.
[51:47.270 --> 51:50.190]  So yeah, if you guys were trying to come to the Secret Cup,
[51:50.190 --> 51:51.290]  the date has been changed.
[51:51.290 --> 51:53.350]  Have they announced the new date?
[51:53.350 --> 51:55.470]  September 27th or something, I think.
[51:55.470 --> 51:56.550]  They announced like the week.
[51:56.550 --> 51:58.430]  They said we'll probably pin down a date
[51:58.430 --> 51:59.270]  as it gets closer.
[51:59.270 --> 52:00.350]  That's kind of how they do it.
[52:00.350 --> 52:01.390]  He may have the date right,
[52:01.390 --> 52:03.390]  but I didn't really look since it's been posted.
[52:04.070 --> 52:05.910]  I want to say the 27th, 28th.
[52:07.670 --> 52:10.590]  That's cool because before it was the same day
[52:10.590 --> 52:14.050]  as a Phish concert and sorry, but Phish won.
[52:16.070 --> 52:18.030]  Yeah, it'll be that Saturday and Sunday,
[52:18.030 --> 52:20.150]  the 27th and 28th of September.
[52:20.150 --> 52:22.270]  Cool, cool.
[52:22.270 --> 52:24.110]  Guys got any plugs you want to do?
[52:24.110 --> 52:25.750]  Where you want anybody to check out?
[52:25.750 --> 52:26.990]  Anybody you want to fucking mention
[52:26.990 --> 52:28.310]  while you got your airtime?
[52:28.310 --> 52:31.350]  Adam is at Overgrow the Gov.
[52:31.350 --> 52:35.630]  Twitch and whatever that other T1 is, Twitter.
[52:35.630 --> 52:36.470]  There you go.
[52:36.470 --> 52:37.990]  Yeah, at Overgrow the Gov on Twitter.
[52:37.990 --> 52:38.990]  Yeah, find him there.
[52:38.990 --> 52:40.710]  Send him filthy shit.
[52:40.710 --> 52:41.550]  He likes it.
[52:41.550 --> 52:43.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:43.070 --> 52:46.870]  Kev, any shout outs, any plugs, advertising?
[52:46.870 --> 52:47.710]  Nah.
[52:47.710 --> 52:48.550]  Nah?
[52:48.550 --> 52:50.190]  I think we already said them.
[52:50.190 --> 52:52.030]  Yeah, we did a lot of cool shout outs.
[52:52.030 --> 52:53.310]  I was going to fucking say so.
[52:53.310 --> 52:56.190]  Shout out to Diamond Dave and the Compound.
[52:56.190 --> 52:58.030]  What up, Diamond Dave?
[52:59.350 --> 53:01.150]  I love to fuck with Dave, man.
[53:01.950 --> 53:03.190]  That's it, man.
[53:03.190 --> 53:06.190]  Like, God, you're so fun to mess with, Dave.
[53:06.190 --> 53:08.590]  Big ups to our friends that are crushing it in Las Vegas.
[53:08.590 --> 53:10.870]  They've got a large grow facility in Clark County.
[53:10.870 --> 53:12.110]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name
[53:12.110 --> 53:14.430]  on a podcast or not, but he knows who he is.
[53:14.430 --> 53:18.270]  He's got that Hell's Angel OG that tested at 30% THC.
[53:18.270 --> 53:19.110]  What?
[53:19.110 --> 53:20.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:20.350 --> 53:21.390]  It's a multiple cup winner.
[53:21.390 --> 53:22.230]  He's got the cup.
[53:22.230 --> 53:23.670]  You're the homie, get the hook up.
[53:23.670 --> 53:25.230]  That's his Vegas prize.
[53:25.230 --> 53:28.830]  He's got a cultivation facility in Vegas,
[53:28.830 --> 53:30.390]  and that's the one that's going to make the man
[53:30.430 --> 53:31.950]  a million bucks.
[53:31.950 --> 53:33.150]  All right.
[53:33.150 --> 53:34.470]  My plugs, I guess it's my turn.
[53:34.470 --> 53:35.790]  Check me out.
[53:35.790 --> 53:37.710]  It's at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[53:38.870 --> 53:41.270]  I post all the episode updates at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[53:41.270 --> 53:42.910]  I'm going to just keep the music down for a minute.
[53:42.910 --> 53:43.750]  I like that.
[53:43.750 --> 53:44.590]  It's easier.
[53:44.590 --> 53:46.830]  At I Grow Culture, yeah, where was I?
[53:46.830 --> 53:49.150]  At I Read Genetics on Instagram.
[53:50.070 --> 53:52.830]  I Grow Culture at Hotmail.com.
[53:52.830 --> 53:54.390]  There's more, but that's enough, dude.
[53:54.390 --> 53:55.510]  You guys know what's up, right?
[53:55.510 --> 53:56.350]  You know where to find me.
[53:56.350 --> 53:57.830]  It's 25 episodes in.
[53:58.670 --> 54:00.630]  Where else would you want to find me?
[54:00.630 --> 54:01.790]  I don't even know.
[54:01.790 --> 54:02.630]  All right.
[54:04.470 --> 54:07.350]  There's constantly links to all your other things too
[54:07.350 --> 54:08.190]  from there.
[54:08.190 --> 54:09.310]  Yeah, I link it all up.
[54:09.310 --> 54:11.190]  As long as you find I Grow Culture on Twitter
[54:11.190 --> 54:12.790]  or I Read Genetics on Instagram
[54:12.790 --> 54:16.390]  or I Read Genetics on Twitter, you'll be happy.
[54:16.390 --> 54:17.230]  You'll find all of it.
[54:17.230 --> 54:18.070]  I link them up.
[54:18.070 --> 54:20.470]  So yeah, that's 25 episodes, you guys.
[54:20.470 --> 54:22.750]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the show.
[54:22.750 --> 54:24.870]  Send me tons of tweets and emails and Facebook messages.
[54:24.870 --> 54:26.670]  It's really cool.
[54:26.670 --> 54:27.670]  This part always sounds fun.
[54:28.510 --> 54:29.630]  I'll turn up some music for this.
[54:29.630 --> 54:31.390]  Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes.
[54:31.390 --> 54:34.030]  Go to the iTunes store, search for I Grow Culture.
[54:34.030 --> 54:35.430]  Find the review section.
[54:35.430 --> 54:37.190]  Give me a five-star rating.
[54:37.190 --> 54:38.350]  After that, type in a comment
[54:38.350 --> 54:39.590]  and let me know what you think of the show.
[54:39.590 --> 54:41.390]  And I will read your comments on the show.
[54:41.390 --> 54:43.030]  If you tell me that I'm awesome,
[54:43.030 --> 54:44.270]  if you tell me that I sound like
[54:44.270 --> 54:45.590]  fucking Charlie Brown's teacher,
[54:45.590 --> 54:47.310]  if you tell me I'm a stupid pothead,
[54:47.310 --> 54:49.030]  if you tell me I should be president,
[54:49.030 --> 54:50.630]  if you tell me I sound like Martians has landed
[54:50.630 --> 54:52.150]  and fucking cut off my brain,
[54:52.150 --> 54:53.670]  I'll say that on the show.
[54:53.670 --> 54:54.510]  I'll do it.
[54:54.510 --> 54:56.150]  I'll read almost anything you type
[54:56.150 --> 54:57.230]  into that comment section,
[54:57.230 --> 54:59.430]  which is kind of scary for somebody to say.
[55:01.630 --> 55:03.230]  I just see the wheels turning and Adam says,
[55:03.230 --> 55:04.070]  I say that.
[55:05.030 --> 55:07.110]  So don't forget that the show is available
[55:07.110 --> 55:10.830]  on iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am,
[55:10.830 --> 55:14.070]  and also on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[55:14.070 --> 55:15.710]  The other day, Stitcher was messing up
[55:15.710 --> 55:16.950]  and not posting the episode.
[55:16.950 --> 55:19.190]  So if it freaks out, you guys,
[55:19.190 --> 55:22.230]  go find me on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[55:22.230 --> 55:23.070]  That's my website.
[55:23.070 --> 55:23.910]  I own that.
[55:23.910 --> 55:25.150]  It will not go away.
[55:25.150 --> 55:28.150]  Every episode is posted there, one through 25.
[55:28.150 --> 55:30.070]  I promise I'll keep them coming.
[55:30.070 --> 55:31.870]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[55:31.870 --> 55:32.710]  Shout out to these boys
[55:32.710 --> 55:34.470]  for sitting through an hour long episode with me
[55:34.470 --> 55:35.310]  and kicking ass.
[55:35.310 --> 55:36.230]  You guys stayed on the mics.
[55:36.230 --> 55:37.910]  You sounded great.
[55:37.910 --> 55:38.830]  Thanks for coming.
[55:38.830 --> 55:41.030]  Thanks for having me for the big two five, man.
[55:41.030 --> 55:43.670]  It's been a little bit since I've been on.
[55:43.670 --> 55:44.710]  Sorry I was late, man.
[55:44.710 --> 55:45.550]  I was trying to.
[55:45.550 --> 55:46.510]  Hey, it worked out well, man.
[55:46.510 --> 55:47.350]  It was perfect.
[55:47.350 --> 55:48.190]  Yeah, I wanted you on
[55:48.190 --> 55:50.110]  because you've been here from the start of that show.
[55:50.110 --> 55:51.790]  Even if we are second choice and all,
[55:51.790 --> 55:53.190]  it's, thank you.
[55:54.190 --> 55:55.030]  Bringing it back.

[56:34.830 --> 56:36.190]  How's that?
[56:36.190 --> 56:37.030]  It's getting a little better.

[59:55.230 --> 59:56.270]  So let's get right down to it.
[59:56.270 --> 59:58.150]  Jesse came over for a grow lesson,
[59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.010]  taught us a lot of stuff about outdoor growing.
[01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.790]  Adam hung out and learned a few things.
[01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.510]  So I'm gonna let the music play for a second.
[01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.430]  We're gonna go ahead and fade in that conversation.
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.910]  And then after that, Adam and I
[01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.570]  will be back to wrap up the show.
[01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:10.030]  Hang on, listen guys, thanks.
[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:16.230]  ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.600]  Eventually they're just gonna fucking stick my iPhone
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.840]  in my head and I can just think like text Adam
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.800]  and tell him to come over and take dabs with me.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.640]  That would be funny.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.440]  Yeah, we're recording now just so that you guys are aware.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.120]  Your next thought would be a little weird.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.960]  Hey, what's up guys?
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.780]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.680]  We're just here having a little random conversation.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.520]  We're gonna have a grow lesson.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.320]  We got Jesse back as promised.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.420]  Hey, what's up?
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.260]  Thanks for coming, bro.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.640]  Also, Adam's back.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.360]  Adam's, he's on the show all the time,
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.680]  but you guys might not know that Adam's a new grower.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.620]  He's kind of new to Colorado.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.680]  It's his first grow season here.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.840]  And he does have some outdoor plants.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.520]  So I invited him to stick around while Jesse's here.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.120]  He may have some good outdoor questions.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  He may bring up some shit that we may overlook.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.100]  So it's always good to have a new guy in
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.880]  to kind of referee us because been told we're kind of snobs
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.960]  and we go a little fast and we talk about shit
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.080]  like everybody should know.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.560]  We'll slow down.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.600]  We'll try to go slow for you guys
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.460]  and keep it at a pace where you can keep up.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.960]  But I do plan to increase the knowledge in this show
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.680]  slowly but surely over time so that you guys
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.360]  can all improve, take your grow to the next level.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.200]  That's right.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.240]  Knowledge is power.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.600]  That came from Adam.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.720]  Never stop learning.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.400]  That might be the smartest thing Adam's gonna say all day.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.920]  That's it.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.240]  You guys said I was too loud in the headphones.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240]  I gotta turn that shit up now.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.080]  You guys are crazy.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.760]  No, you were too loud in my headphones.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.600]  All right.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.400]  So of course we're back for an outdoor grow lesson.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.600]  It's full bloom time.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.280]  Your plants should be starting to flower.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.120]  You guys.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:37.960]  Rocking and rolling.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.780]  Rocking and rolling.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.840]  All right, all right.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.680]  Signs of flower.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.720]  Hopefully you guys have pulled your mails.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.440]  It's time to pull the mails now, right?
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.400]  Yeah.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.720]  It's past time.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.560]  Way, way past time.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.320]  If you haven't pulled your mails,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.000]  you've got a seeded crop and your neighbors
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.680]  have a seeded crop and someone else on the block
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.040]  has a seeded crop and they're all pissed off at you.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.580]  So you fucked up.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.840]  But hopefully you pulled your mails by now
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840]  because you're in full bloom.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.100]  So that means we're probably 25, 30 days in.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.620]  He's pulling out a calendar
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.260]  is why we have a little bit of silence.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.100]  Yeah, sure.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.940]  For some strains.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.780]  For some strains.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.600]  Okay.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.940]  Adam was saying he had one that took a long time
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.420]  to switch into flower.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.020]  It's just now getting to the point
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.620]  where it's like visibly flower.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:13.460]  It probably did.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.340]  It probably switched last week or so officially, you know,
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.900]  but it is, it had definitely taken,
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.020]  it might be a little bit longer,
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.460]  but it, the other two had switched into flower
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.140]  three or four weeks ago, obviously,
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.460]  and now have decent sides.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.300]  So I'm not sure.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.740]  Decent sides, quarter size buds.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.580]  Nice.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.400]  Nice.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.240]  That's about where I am.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.220]  Here's a random question.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.020]  How long since you're an outdoor grower?
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:38.860]  I'm asking Jesse.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.300]  He's an out inexperienced outdoor grower.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.140]  I'm a city boy.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:41.960]  I live indoors.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.800]  I grow indoors.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.580]  I don't worry too much about the outside.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.420]  I don't know the answer.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.620]  I am a city boy.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.540]  Yeah, you take me to the sticks and I'm fucking scared, bro.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.100]  I need a gun to fucking protect myself out there.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.940]  But-
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.760]  Me too.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.600]  Okay.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.780]  Yeah, but if you don't jump at everything,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.620]  I'm like, what was that?
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.440]  What was that?
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.280]  It was fucking life, dude.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.120]  Chill out.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.940]  Mm-hmm.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.380]  What was I gonna ask you now?
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.220]  I don't know.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.040]  Oh, okay.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:04.880]  How long do we have?
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.740]  How many weeks or about when do you expect frost?
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.140]  When does it get too cold for our outdoor crop?
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.900]  That's a, that's always a good question.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.380]  If I know the answer to that.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.940]  You're not mother nature, are you?
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.780]  Yeah.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.620]  Okay.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.140]  I've noticed-
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:20.980]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.900]  Oh, would you agree that in Colorado,
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.820]  in Pueblo, Colorado, nature loves to snow on Halloween
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.960]  and fuck up all the kids' costumes on Halloween?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.260]  That's kind of our traditional, you know.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.100]  Okay.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.500]  So get them down October 30th.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.340]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.160]  You'll start to be able to tell.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.000]  If you guys-
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.820]  For sure.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.140]  So I'm gonna grab a calendar right quick.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.020]  I wanna see how many weeks.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.780]  I'll just ask Siri.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.600]  She'll tell me.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.540]  Siri is great.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.380]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.580]  Here we go.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.420]  You gotta use-
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.940]  How many days until Halloween?
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.840]  Oh, there we go.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.760]  She'll tell me.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.520]  She failed.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.760]  Siri's been a not friendly chick today.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.840]  Fire.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.400]  How many days until Halloween?
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.960]  She's looking.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.560]  70 days.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.120]  Oh, so most trains should be done.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:07.960]  Yeah.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.920]  Even your stuff that just started flowering
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.760]  should be done.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.600]  All right.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.420]  Yeah.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.260]  Cool.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.320]  70 days from, so today is actually Thursday.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.920]  The show won't go up until Monday morning.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.920]  So you're gonna have closer to 65,
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.160]  but you probably won't listen until Wednesday.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:21.980]  So-
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.260]  Mm-hmm.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.100]  You're kidding.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:24.920]  Get down to nine weeks.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.220]  You got about nine weeks to flower, guys.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.860]  Nine or 10 weeks.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.700]  Depending on where you are.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.660]  If you're in California,
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.340]  you could get that shit out no problem.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.260]  But if you're in Colorado,
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.100]  you got about nine weeks.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:33.920]  If you're higher up,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.260]  if you're towards Denver,
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.180]  you may wanna cut that little closer to Thanksgiving.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.980]  People, folks in California
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.340]  have been flowering longer than us.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.820]  It seems like a lot of them.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.020]  You know, from the pictures I've seen,
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.980]  they definitely went into flower sooner.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.020]  I can imagine several things
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.100]  why that would be,
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.060]  but I wonder what the actual reason is.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.700]  Do you think they've selected better strains?
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.580]  No.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.420]  Autoflowers?
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.760]  Okay.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.280]  Send all hate mail too.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.060]  Wah, wah, wah.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.420]  I don't know.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.340]  I wonder if the coast,
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.740]  maybe like just their different region,
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.760]  they're at a different latitude and longitude in the earth.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.460]  North and south makes a huge difference.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.860]  They get the sun, you know,
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.060]  a slightly different angle or something like that.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.120]  Guys, if somebody understands
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.740]  why those plants in Cali flowered sooner,
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.580]  I think we just nailed it.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.060]  But if you got the science-y reason,
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.380]  tweet that to me, email it to me,
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.780]  agroculture at hotmail.com,
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.900]  at agroculture on Twitter.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.720]  Let me know.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.820]  We'd like to understand more of that.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.740]  Agroculture on Facebook.
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.580]  We get it, but we want you to explain it
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.300]  because we're podcast hosts and stoners,
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.100]  and that's fucking, you can explain it.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.460]  We'd like to understand.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.300]  Yeah.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.140]  Yeah.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.680]  So I asked Jesse when he got here,
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.920]  we took a bunch of dabs, of course,
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.640]  and then we talked about what we wanted to do.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.440]  He talked about top dressing a little bit.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.560]  Do you want to talk about the mulching
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.520]  and the top dressing?
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.360]  You know, I think it's safe to say
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.680]  to go ahead and switch over all your top dressings
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.480]  and your teas and stuff to, you know,
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.380]  throw in that high P stuff, high PK,
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.460]  you know, pretty much chill out on the nitrogen.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.320]  Adam's got some plants that are nitrogen deficient,
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.200]  visibly on the lower, lower bottom,
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.940]  lower third of the plant.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.580]  I told him to hit it real good with nitrogen
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.400]  one more time, real hard for his feeding.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.720]  And he'd think, yeah, okay.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.560]  All right, I'm going to turn this mic
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]  a little more to your face.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.400]  Sorry.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.240]  Sorry.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.560]  We're getting Jesse trained on podcast.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.880]  He'll be a lot more audible now.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880]  I just noticed that.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.760]  Oh yeah, look at that.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.580]  We can hear him.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.420]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.260]  No worries, bro.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.080]  You're learning, dude.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.920]  You're way, I got to compliment you.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.000]  You're way more comfortable,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.440]  way more fluid on the show now
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.960]  compared to the first episode.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.960]  I think you were on number eight or six.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.440]  It was number eight and we're at 26 now, bro.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440]  So you've been coming quite a few times.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.280]  Nice.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.120]  Yeah.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:58.940]  All right, keep going.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.960]  Sorry, I totally interrupted you.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.400]  Maybe give it like a little foliar feed
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.640]  locally just to that part of the plant,
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.260]  a high nitrogen, you know,
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.120]  several different ways you could do that.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.000]  My option is basically to put grow
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.260]  in a bottle and spray it.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.000]  For sure.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.680]  Really dilute.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.280]  That would work perfectly.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.720]  If anything, that's my problem
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.760]  is I'm a little underfeeding.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.600]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.420]  Yeah.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.260]  I mean, you gave me the chart
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.840]  and I've just been basically going off of that
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.640]  besides all the additives that I should have gotten
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.200]  probably by now that I don't have.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.760]  Yes, I told Adam to buy a couple of things.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.600]  And I didn't get them.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.440]  So.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.280]  Well, now you can see it.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.100]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.680]  Yeah, but now that's understandable.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.520]  You're a new grower.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.360]  You don't have a budget to allocate to growing.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.680]  You got a family, you got a life.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.080]  Learn to do chemicals.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.520]  Learn to take nutrients.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.360]  Not chemicals.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.040]  I just want to avoid the word chemicals.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.400]  I don't mean to be so, but yeah.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.520]  Chemicals is a scary word.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.360]  Nutrients is a safe word.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.520]  Well, I steered clear of Miracle Grow
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.080]  on the East Coast because.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.920]  When you harvest this.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.880]  I'm such a devil.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.840]  Try to either, if you have a patient friend
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.160]  that needs some medicine
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.260]  or I don't know the fucking straight way to do that.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.080]  But save the money that you normally would have gone
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.640]  to your caregiver or your dispensary.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.960]  Save that money next year
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.320]  because you're going to have your own pot
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.160]  because you're growing it
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.280]  and buy those bottles that you could not get this year.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.120]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.800]  Make your shit a little bit better next year.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.440]  And then the next year, a little bit better.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.320]  And then by the time you're just an amateur grower,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.520]  you don't need the fucking rockstar drum set yet.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.880]  By the time you're a good rockstar,
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.040]  you'll have a rockstar set up.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.880]  You'll know what you're doing.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.700]  And it's easier to learn.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.840]  I think you learn better.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.200]  I became a good grower because I started with struggle bud.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.720]  You know, I started with a shitty setup
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.960]  and was like, oh, this sucks.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.240]  And then had to grow a whole crop through that
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.640]  because you don't want to rebuild your room
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.860]  in the middle of a grow
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.240]  and then bought the next upgrade
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.360]  and then realized I just never had a room.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.280]  I've always had like a small box with plants in it.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.880]  And then now it's outdoors.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.700]  So-
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.540]  You were never in a state
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.600]  where you could just go to the grow shop
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.840]  and be like, I need this.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.600]  Yeah, we could walk in.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.320]  It almost feels like we're cheating.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.240]  It's almost too easy.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.960]  It is cheating at this point.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.280]  It's almost too easy.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.120]  For sure.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.320]  All right, let's go back to top dressing with mulch.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.680]  You should be hooking them up with your full bloom feed.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.220]  Like you were saying, pull back on the nitrogen,
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.440]  get your phosphorus and potassium in there heavily.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.920]  For sure.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.560]  So you're mulching.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.040]  You're, explain that to the guys that like,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.600]  fuck, I'll tell you, I'm retarded on mulching.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.760]  I know how to mulch my yard and my trees outside.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.240]  What are we using for mulch for our weed plants?
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.020]  I've been using fresh green matter.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.540]  Most of it's from the plant itself, the leaves.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.840]  And weed seedlings I've been pulling up.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.000]  And then also I've been,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.960]  well, I've been mixing that with straw.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.000]  That's been composted.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.520]  And I'm, you know,
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.880]  I'm building a mulch mound around the plants
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.440]  that's probably eight, 10 inches tall
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.360]  and the circumference of the, yeah.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.600]  I'm picturing a coffee can is kind of what I see.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.520]  Coffee can for sure.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.880]  I mean, it's a fricking mound, man.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.720]  Okay.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.400]  I mean, yeah, no, it's pretty, you know,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.240]  maybe closer to like 10 or 12 inches in the center.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.320]  Then we're coming out probably two feet circumference.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.200]  Wow.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.200]  But when I've removed part of the, to apply top dressing,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.760]  the root growth that I've seen is just phenomenal.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.560]  The soil just looks better.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.880]  It looks happier.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.600]  It's not as tight as it normally gets
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.000]  when it's getting sunbaked.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.480]  And, you know, I've always top or mulched a little bit,
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.640]  but never to this extent.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.080]  I've just-
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.680]  So in nature, wouldn't leaves fall off of a plant
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.320]  and kind of decompose where the plant's growing
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.960]  and provide that nutrient for next year.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.920]  So that makes a lot of great sense.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.760]  Here's my question.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.840]  Do you ever worry about heat with that?
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.680]  No.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.560]  No?
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.880]  I mean, I did initially,
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.080]  cause I mean, I know how a complex fire works.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:54.920]  Yeah.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.240]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.120]  But that's why I've always kind of steered away from it.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:03.480]  But doing the big mound with, you know,
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.240]  it's just, it's worked great.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.600]  You know, it'll be dry on top,
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.160]  but as I work down into it-
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.760]  I've looked for something to keep the heat off my soil
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.160]  because my soil is just baked and I tried sand
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.000]  because somebody was like,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.760]  I'll just put a layer of sand on there.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.960]  And I went out there and my plants were like.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.800]  So-
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.280]  The sand choked them out good.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.880]  Don't use sand.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.720]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.560]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.400]  Don't use sand.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.680]  You can get rid of your dirt bugs with sand.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.040]  If you do it, use a really tiny, tiny layer.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.480]  Just, yeah.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.080]  Just make some diatonation so it's into your feet.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.080]  Reapply it every single time after you-
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.920]  Water.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.760]  Water.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.720]  So it looks like we've kind of worked over
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.960]  to one of the things that we wrote down
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.440]  to talk about watering.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.600]  If you're outdoor growing,
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.320]  it's been 90 something degrees in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.800]  How much water?
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.040]  Okay, Adam, I'll ask you first
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.400]  because Jesse's going to have a lot to say.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.560]  You're kind of a new guy.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.960]  What size are your pots?
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.200]  Five gallon.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.360]  Your plants, from what I see,
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.560]  look to be about four feet tall.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.440]  One's four foot.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.040]  The other two are right at my chin.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:02.880]  So about five foot.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.700]  Okay.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.540]  I'm just looking at pictures on Facebook.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.640]  Guys haven't gone over there and looked.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.400]  I don't want to spider mites.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.240]  Yeah.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.000]  It's fine.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.320]  That's a gardener joke.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.160]  You guys will razzle.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.560]  There you go.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.080]  He does not have bugs.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:15.920]  Only in his hair.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.760]  Yep.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.920]  All right.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.960]  Only the beneficial kind.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.520]  You got four foot tall plants.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.360]  You got worms.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.440]  And five gallon pots.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.120]  How often and how much are you watering those girls?
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.480]  Every day before the sun comes up,
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.040]  getting the hose out
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.200]  and literally filling it up to the top
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.760]  three different times.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.900]  By the end of the day,
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.740]  they are dry and I can pick them up with one hand.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.220]  Wow.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.040]  Wow.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.880]  So you guys got to get on it.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.700]  It's a lot of water.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.540]  Every single day.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.380]  And if you think,
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.700]  oh, I'll just wait until noon.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:46.900]  No, you won't.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.100]  Because you will go out there
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.020]  and they will be sad pieces of lump.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:50.860]  And you'll be like,
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.180]  oh my God, what have I done?
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.020]  Yeah.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.080]  I've waited until nine or 10
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.660]  and went out there and they're screaming for water.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.740]  So water your plants.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.340]  Water your plants.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.920]  Try wrapping some white plastic around them.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.760]  Okay.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.580]  Yeah.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.420]  White plastic.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.780]  Instead of retaining it.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.620]  Okay.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.740]  And get you a good size mulch going.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.580]  All right.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.620]  Yeah.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.260]  Another thing about the mulch,
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.240]  I just pulled a whole bunch of weeds out of my yard.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.540]  They were tall and atrocious.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.280]  Could I just throw them in a bucket
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.260]  and start mulching them?
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.380]  I'm worried about bugs.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.220]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.060]  I mean.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.100]  Yeah, that.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.940]  The plant matter I can definitely work with.
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.100]  I'd be a little nervous about that personally.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.420]  So don't just grab any weeds and start mulching it.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.260]  Yeah.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.920]  Okay.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.720]  I'm, you know, select about my,
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.680]  my weeds are actually morning glory seeds.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.520]  So.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.360]  Nice.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.920]  And if anyone knows anything about morning glory.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.760]  Yeah.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.580]  Yeah.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.420]  Highly, highly invasive.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.640]  So it's easy to find, but.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.280]  So how much water, sorry.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.680]  How big are your plants outdoors?
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.560]  Can I even ask you that?
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.320]  I can avoid questions you don't want to answer.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.320]  We're doing like a six to eight foot.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.600]  Each one's probably minimum of four foot in circumference.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.880]  So they're.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.800]  That takes the three of us to put our arms together
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.840]  to get around it probably.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.680]  Yeah.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.120]  This stocks as big as that water bottle.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.960]  Yeah.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.780]  I've seen pictures.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.360]  The stocks are as big as my forearm.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.200]  Yeah.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.020]  Coming out of the ground.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:17.860]  One of them is actually.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.700]  Yeah.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.520]  It's pretty gnarly.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.360]  Moved from plants to shrubs.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.400]  How much, how much water does a plant
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.300]  that size take every day?
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.760]  Seven and a half to 10 gallons a day.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.920]  Wow.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.400]  Times however many plants he's got.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.560]  We won't even go there.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.400]  So you got to.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.280]  Purinated.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.120]  Yeah.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:33.960]  Filtered.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.780]  Areated.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.620]  Exactly where I was headed to.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.760]  It's got to be hauled in somewhere.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.560]  If you're out in a rural area,
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560]  because there's not enough water to do that.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.880]  If you're just coming out of your well,
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.980]  sometimes you don't want to drain the well.
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.400]  You got to have water for your life.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.240]  Piss your neighbors off real good too.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.400]  I didn't even think of that shit.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.240]  Oh man.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.960]  And then the federal government regulates most wells.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.780]  Yeah.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.620]  They can't know that you're.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.820]  They're real understanding of pot grows
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.660]  as I understand it.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.640]  So.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.520]  They're real inviting for that sort of thing.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:05.920]  All right.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.740]  So we've covered a lot about water.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.560]  Oh man, there was a hum and I just found it.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.960]  There was a squeal in my headphones.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.240]  I hope it only happened in my ears,
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.720]  but it went blah, blah, blah just a minute ago.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.280]  And that was my headphone.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.540]  Could have been my head.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540]  All right.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.880]  So yeah, that's something we talked about a few episodes ago.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.240]  The federal government is banning fucking water use
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.960]  for dispensaries and grows, which if they catch,
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.100]  if a federal agent, federal agent,
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.840]  if somebody for like the department of waterworks
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.120]  or somebody, some of them that works in a federal agency
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.400]  discovers water in their municipality being used
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.240]  for a cannabis grow,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.560]  they're supposed to report the cannabis grow in the water.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.960]  That's something we talked about a few episodes ago.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.800]  Wack shit.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.600]  Be careful, you guys be super careful.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.640]  Try to be super discreet.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.040]  All right.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.820]  We talked a little bit about worms.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.040]  You were saying that the worms were crawling up
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.280]  into your mulch.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.960]  That's crazy.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.520]  That means happy mulch.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.360]  Yeah.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.240]  The worms get up there.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.080]  They're probably eating those leaves.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:58.920]  Yeah.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.640]  They're probably secreting their enzymes
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.520]  all over those leaves.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.000]  Those leaves are breaking down and becoming nutrients
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.200]  that are more bioavailable to the plants.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.520]  So that's a win-win situation for everybody.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.360]  Yeah.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.880]  Do you guys hear that?
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.720]  Nope.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.560]  Okay.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.600]  It's just my headphones or something.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.040]  No, it's like digital sound in my ear.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.880]  Yeah.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.260]  It sounds like a telegraph.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.360]  There's a fan on or something.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.200]  I wasn't sure.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.040]  It's a digital noise.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.160]  Sorry, guys, I'm tripping out over here.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.960]  I don't like the sound of part of this equipment.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.400]  Oh, no, mine's gone.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.240]  Yeah.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.060]  It's this a HAO4 from LiveWire Solutions.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.240]  I've talked about it on the show before.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.280]  Fuck this thing.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.120]  We've heard about it.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:36.940]  Yeah, that's what's failing.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:37.940]  It's out now for me.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.780]  Is it out completely?
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.720]  Yep.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.560]  How about now?
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.380]  There you go.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.220]  All right, guys.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.060]  Oh, it sounds better in mine too.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:43.880]  Hey, cool.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.720]  Cool.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.560]  Hey, if things works.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.320]  Hey, whatever channel I'm on, solid.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.160]  Nice, channel one, yeah.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.040]  Because they never did nothing throughout that.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:50.880]  Cool.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.580]  Sorry you had to listen to that.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.520]  This headphone app sucks.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.360]  Don't ever buy it.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.280]  I will not say the name of the company one more time.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.640]  It's a LiveWire Solutions HAO4,
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.840]  four channel stereo headphone amplifier.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.880]  Don't buy that thing.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.120]  That's my anti-sponsor right there.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.700]  You guys keep saying, won't you buy something better?
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.400]  Well, I bought this one and it keeps breaking.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.320]  So I go to Guitar Center and I say, this thing broke again.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.160]  And they just give me another one of the same thing.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.060]  So it just costs me a trip to Guitar Center
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.320]  every few weeks, which, you know, they're cool over there.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.280]  And I always find new toys.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.760]  So what the hell?
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.600]  Let's do it.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.240]  Hopefully the company goes out of business.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.640]  Then you get an upgrade.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.840]  There you go.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.660]  If I recall.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:28.500]  Now you're thinking, yeah.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.480]  Or at least some store credit on an upgrade or something.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.320]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.340]  That's just random talk, guys.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.320]  I hope you enjoy hearing us talk about random shit.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.320]  I get messages that are like, just hang out and talk.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.280]  We love hearing you talk.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.720]  So that was some of that.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.200]  You probably want to hear me talk about weed
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.440]  and not my piece of shit equipment, but that's all right.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.960]  So worms, yeah, worms are awesome.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.160]  Put worms by the roots of your plants all the time.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.000]  That's good stuff.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:49.840]  Yeah.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.920]  Hey, and if you find a worm, don't bury it.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.360]  That's not how that works.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.820]  Let me re-explain that and not stone or talk it.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.800]  If you find a worm and you want to put it into your plant,
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.660]  don't bury it.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.480]  Gently put him on the surface.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.120]  And work his way down or its way in there.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.600]  I'm sure yours are in the ground.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.960]  So finding worms in your plants are one thing,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.800]  but should I go out and get some worms?
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.040]  Would that be beneficial at the beginning of,
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.840]  when I first put the plants out there?
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.280]  I don't think it would hurt.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.120]  It wouldn't hurt.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.480]  You're feeding bottled nutrients.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.480]  There's a lot of acids and salts in what you're feeding.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.440]  They're going to wreak havoc on your-
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.320]  I've inadvertently had worms in indoor plants before,
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.440]  but never purposely.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.120]  How about growing mushrooms in your soil on accident?
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.000]  Those yellow mushrooms that pop up?
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.280]  I see a lot of that in Colorado
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.360]  because of the weird climate changes.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.280]  Yeah.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.000]  I got some crazy grokashi compost going on right now.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.520]  That's about to start doing some mushrooms.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520]  Nice.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.640]  Shout out to the Probiotic Farmers Alliance,
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.520]  Cage Green Genetics, Key Play.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.120]  Big, big love to all those guys.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.600]  I think I'm really, really stoked about this stuff.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.920]  All of the stuff they grow with that looks great.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.280]  Looks amazing.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.120]  You know, I've been talking with Jesse a lot
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.280]  about farming and stuff and talking to,
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.240]  not talking to, but listening to a guy named Jim Frere
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.080]  on Facebook.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.600]  He's a excellent grower.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.840]  He's a scientist, dude.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.680]  He's awesome.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.120]  He's a organic chemistry guy.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.800]  He knows a lot of things.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.080]  Between all you organic farmers and you outdoor guys,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.720]  I need a compost pile.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.640]  I'm a vegetarian and I'm over there chopping up pineapple,
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.840]  watermelon, strawberries, kale, lettuce, onions,
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.920]  tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers,
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.120]  whatever else you brought me today.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.680]  I didn't even get to look into the bag far enough.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.680]  But I chop up all that.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.960]  And every one of those has a piece
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.120]  that you chop off and don't eat.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:42.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.840]  That little part where the stem comes out
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.360]  or the little tip that's funky.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.200]  For sure.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.040]  Bananas have a peel.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.440]  My avocado, I eat a ton of avocados.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.280]  They all have a peel.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.000]  They always have some shitty brown spot in them.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.480]  Instead of throwing that in the damn trash,
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.280]  I need a compost pile for all of that.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.640]  No, just try the grocache.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.760]  Just what I've been doing is just a bucket.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.360]  I've got one right now.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.180]  It's just all veggie scraps, which would be all greens.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.600]  I've got another one I'm doing.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.840]  Started a little earlier.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.860]  It's half carbon, half greens.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.640]  Explain the carbon to the retards.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.480]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.160]  To me, I said retards because it was me.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.320]  Sorry guys.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.000]  Greens are living things.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.680]  Carbon would be like peat moss,
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.720]  I suppose would be carbon.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.760]  Coconut or cocoa shell.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.760]  Dried up sticks, dried up leaves.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.600]  Peanut shells.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.440]  Peanut shells.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.260]  Because I eat a lot of nuts.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.100]  Egg shells.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.280]  Egg shells.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.480]  But you have to have a 50-50 mixture.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.320]  Well, you don't have to have, but to get-
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.160]  It's ideal.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.000]  Yeah, to get it rock and roll good.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  It's what you're shooting for.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.660]  All right.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.880]  So I just took that, a third of a cup of grocache.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.000]  Mix that fucker in there.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.240]  Threw it away.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.920]  Six days later, I mean, I can visually see
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.440]  stuff turning into humate.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.280]  You know?
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.100]  Wow.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:00.940]  Yeah.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:01.780]  I got pictures of it on-
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.620]  Did you get that white web of life in there?
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:03.460]  Oh, big time.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.280]  Oh, big time.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.120]  Okay.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.960]  Here, I'll-
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.840]  Can you send one to my phone
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.400]  and then let me tweet that from the show's stuff?
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.240]  For sure.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.060]  I totally will.
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.320]  I'm gonna tweet Jesse's pic.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.160]  I'm writing it.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.080]  And I've tried lots of different styles
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.480]  of composting before.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.800]  And this is, hands down, the easiest.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.520]  Yeah, that sounds like it's right up my alley.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.360]  I'm super stoked,
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.720]  because I'll be able to have fresh compost
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.560]  all through the winter.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.280]  Can I put carrots and shit in there?
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.120]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.000]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.200]  Oh, that soil is ready to grow some shit, dude.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.040]  Oh man.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:32.880]  Yeah, that's-
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.040]  And then just add that to my root organic base?
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.560]  Yeah, I'm gonna let it go for like a month,
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.120]  is kind of what I was reading from this guy.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.560]  I'm gonna sift it out, if it needs to be,
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.720]  which is like a quarter inch screen.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.840]  You just take it all, dump it on there, sift it through.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.200]  It'll catch anything that's not composted yet.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.480]  And then everything that comes through is bam.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.480]  It's beautiful.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.640]  Beautiful, beautiful compost.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.720]  That's a good idea, you guys.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.560]  I'm sold on that.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.480]  That was a quick rundown, and I'm sold on that.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.840]  Two five gallon buckets and some table scraps
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.280]  and a bag of Grokashi,
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.600]  and you're making awesome compost.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.440]  Yeah, let's see.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.520]  I got a picture of, this was Dave on.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.920]  It's a bunch of celery.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.840]  Some, oh, coffee grounds are carbon too.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.920]  Okay, looks like some asparagus maybe in there.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.360]  She drinks coffee, so that would-
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.960]  Maybe some asparagus in there, something like that.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.400]  So I'm a vegetarian, man.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.800]  Almost everything I eat could go in.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.360]  Yeah, and I've just-
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.880]  You always got something.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.280]  There's always, watermelon has a rind.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.440]  Strawberries have that little green thing at the tip.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.680]  Everything's got something, some sort of waste to it.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.120]  Bananas have a peel, like I was saying.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.080]  Everything comes off the vine at some point.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.800]  And usually where it comes off the vine,
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.640]  we as Americans don't eat.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.960]  I don't wanna eat that part.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.040]  I'm not, yeah.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.040]  Nigerian meme.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.720]  You could even experiment with some scraps
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.800]  from different grows and stuff like that.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.840]  Yeah, clean leaves.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.960]  Good clean leaves, old stems could be my fiber part.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.920]  Yeah, my carbon part.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.760]  For sure.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.840]  Awesome, that's a great idea.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.640]  Man, you guys just learned something with me.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.480]  I'm glad we could all learn that together.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.320]  I would guess that's what you do
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.480]  with your fan leaves too at the end.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.920]  Yeah, that's what I do for sure.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.880]  Yeah, I'm tempted to buy a juicer.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.560]  I also have another way of composting.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.800]  This is actually the easiest way of composting
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.760]  I've ever discovered.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.040]  I feed it to my chickens.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.560]  So, but not everyone has that luxury.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.240]  I don't watch it.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.080]  I don't know if they shoot it out at high nutrient levels.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]  Yeah.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.960]  All right, what was I about to say?
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.840]  Oh, I don't even remember.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.640]  There were so many things happening to my brain just now.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.480]  That's a lot.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.320]  Let's get back on topic here.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.120]  Snotsberries taste like what?
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.920]  They taste like snotsberry, man.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.760]  Snots.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.760]  Yeah, all the stuff we're eating,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.080]  we should think about what we put into ourselves
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.120]  because that's what we should be feeding our plants
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:44.960]  kind of the same way.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.240]  You don't wanna feed your plants watermelons,
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.120]  but like think about what's in,
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.040]  yeah, think about your health,
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:50.880]  think about your plant health.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.720]  It's all the same shit.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.480]  Once you start paying attention, you'll match up,
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.920]  you'll start feeling better.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.400]  You'll definitely pay attention.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.240]  I noticed that from the last show that you were here
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.440]  and you said, you know, we go out
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:03.560]  and we spend the money on expensive bud
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.320]  and expensive water.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.920]  And then we just put 99 cents.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.560]  I'm the worst at that, dude.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.040]  I'm a cheeseburger fanatic.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.320]  So I've been, I told her straight up after that,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.680]  like go get meals, go make food.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.520]  For sure.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.360]  It's fun.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.960]  I mean, me and my wife cook together.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.640]  So I didn't go that far.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.680]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.880]  She listens to the show.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.040]  Don't give her ideas.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:28.880]  You shut your mouth.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.080]  Get in the kitchen and cook, bro.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.640]  It's fun.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.440]  I cooked lunch with a little lady today
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.520]  and it was a great time.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.960]  I cook for her sometimes.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.160]  Usually she can't make bacon the best,
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.000]  but you know what I'm saying?
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  See, well, that's your job.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.440]  Then get in there and you make the bacon.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.280]  That's why they say it.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.120]  Making bacon.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.320]  Making the bacon.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.840]  Yep, yep.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:46.960]  All right, let's get back on track
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.240]  maybe a little bit.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.080]  A little bit.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.760]  But I don't know, it's my show.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]  We can do whatever we want.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.840]  I was following you.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.200]  I mean, I agree with you,
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.600]  but I mean, we don't have to get back on track at all.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.560]  You know what?
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.280]  So let's talk more about bacon.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.560]  You seen any good cartoons lately?
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.400]  No.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.520]  Everyone just leans back in their chair.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.760]  Rick and Morty is great,
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.520]  but I'm not aware of Rick and Morty.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.960]  Oh, that show is so bizarre.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.520]  Dude, if you want to, say,
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.120]  try to get drinking and driving is cool off to children,
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:13.960]  this is a better show.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.120]  Oh, you've told me about this one
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.400]  where the guy's drinking constantly.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]  He's flying a spaceship.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.040]  Let's clarify that.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.400]  And it's like, okay,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.280]  but he's slammed by the end of every show.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.080]  Like, isn't everything just better?
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.320]  All right, we're hitting flour hard.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.360]  Our plants are in flour.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.280]  We're showing the fuzzies.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.160]  We've pulled our males.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.000]  We've top dressed.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.240]  Our worms are happy.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.280]  We've switched to full bloom nutrients.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.640]  You're feeding bottle nutrients,
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.000]  go lightly on the nitrogen there,
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.240]  the grow or the bloom stuff.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.000]  Now, if you're feeding teas and stuff,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.720]  what should we be mixing into our teas at this time?
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.920]  Seabird guano.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.880]  That's pretty much where I get all my nitrogen
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.400]  for the bloom phase from.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.160]  And then also most seabird guanos,
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.600]  typically, kind of high NP.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.000]  Literally. At least a little bit.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.920]  This show's way off track already today.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.760]  This is awesome.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.160]  All right.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.040]  I should have known that was coming
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.480]  from the look on your face.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.400]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.240]  We need a dab, I think.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.680]  I'm gonna get dabs going for everybody.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.040]  So seabird guano.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.560]  What else are you putting in there?
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.120]  I actually had a conversation with a gentleman
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.800]  about this earlier today.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.160]  Was it Armando Vigil?
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.000]  Sure, yeah.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.520]  If you just want to throw him on blast like that.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.360]  No, he's a cool guy.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.000]  I don't want to actually put him on blast.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:43.840]  I want to give him a shout out.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.520]  That dude listens to the show.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.360]  He's a loyal listener.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.320]  He's a shopper at I Grow a Pueblo.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.160]  Fuck yeah.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.200]  So that's a lot of support.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.040]  He shops at the stores I recommend.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.800]  He buys the seeds I recommend.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.520]  He grows products I recommend.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.360]  He listens to your advice to the fucking word, bro.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.440]  He wants to do exactly what he knows that success is proven
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.880]  and he wants to do what we are doing.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.520]  So he's a loyal listener.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.440]  He's become my friend.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.360]  He's gonna come hang out with us the next time he's around.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.680]  He lives a little bit away from here.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.200]  He was messaging me the last time he was here
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.040]  but I wasn't prepared.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.840]  I was working and the phone was jingling away
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.320]  from my pocket, but.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.160]  For sure.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.000]  Yeah, next time we're gonna hang out, bro.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.820]  I look forward to hanging out with you.
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.960]  So shout out to Mr. Vigil.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.320]  I'm pretty sure it's Armando Vigil.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.160]  Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.000]  That sounds right.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.040]  I get lost on names.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.520]  I'm not even looking at a screen, so I'm 90% sure.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.560]  I know it's Armando,
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.040]  because that's just fun to say.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:31.880]  Cool.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.360]  I didn't want to take a Mondo dab.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.200]  An Armando.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.120]  I'm gonna make sure I'm saying your name right, bro.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.880]  Just because I'd feel like a dick if I'm all shot
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.720]  and not the wrong guy.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.600]  We're gonna go look right now.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.920]  We're going to Facebook.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.320]  I'm doing it.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.680]  I'm gonna get this out before I dab.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.320]  Yeah, the hype-y bat guanos, if you got them.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.800]  You know, they're good.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.520]  They're not very sustainable.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.160]  Any of those bat guanos really, really suck,
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.780]  but it is what it is, so don't, you know.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.520]  Not everyone's as conflicted as I am, I suppose, but.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.680]  I'm shouting out the right guy.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.520]  Yeah, nice.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.360]  I'm happy now.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.440]  That's sweet.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.440]  But yeah, switch to the hype-y and rock it out.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.360]  Any molasses?
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.080]  Yeah, I always do molasses.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.480]  I always do molasses.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.920]  Almost every feed in flower after day 21, I have molasses.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.320]  Or something similar, humble honey, the Mendocino honey.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.640]  Those are, I like the humble
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.720]  because it's got the yucca extract in there.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.160]  The Mendocino honey is dirt cheap.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.000]  It's dirty cheap.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.760]  There might be yucca extract in that one, but not as much.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  Oh, he's taking a pretty big dab right now.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.400]  Carb cap if you want it, there you go.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.880]  Yeah, I don't really know why he put it on that,
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.720]  but whatever.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.640]  It was the type of shatter.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.640]  It was just hard to pull it up with that other dabber.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.540]  I needed the cutting edge on that one.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.960]  Hey, TaskRock, shout out, brother.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.800]  There it is.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.080]  Well, that completely made me forget
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.080]  what we were talking about.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.320]  Good, good, good.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.360]  I hope the listeners are taking dabs with this.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.240]  Fishbone mill, that's always high in P.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.640]  That's some good stuff too.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.080]  And I always go with the kelp.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.800]  And I've noticed something.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.680]  I wonder what's up with this.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.600]  I've had some kelp that is 101.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:31.360]  And then I just recently bought some kelp that is 001.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.360]  It's the exact same strain.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.200]  Or you know, this is derived from,
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.680]  and it's that whatever strain that you always see.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.560]  But yeah, I wonder what's up with that.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.600]  You know, I don't pay enough attention to the packaging.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.920]  I should start looking at that one.
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.960]  I know, that's, there's certain things
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.120]  I never pay attention to because you know.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.400]  The look on my face doesn't convey on a podcast,
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.520]  but I've got a very curious look now.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.640]  Like, huh, did they make different packaging
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.040]  for different runs or, because you know,
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:00.880]  stuff like that's gonna be inconsistent.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.040]  It was different companies too.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:02.880]  Okay.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.720]  But still, I mean,
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.000]  where did the nitrogen come from all of a sudden?
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:06.840]  You know, or.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.200]  Yeah, or where did it go?
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.560]  It's supposed to be the same product.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.400]  Yeah.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.120]  Just different testing calibrations.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:12.960]  For sure.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.800]  Yeah.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.440]  Well, it's supposed to be standardized though.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.240]  Yeah, but you know, a lot of shit is.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.400]  A lot of shit is supposed to be standardized.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.240]  Supposed to be.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.080]  Supposed to.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:21.920]  Yeah.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.740]  All right, it's my turn.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.920]  I'm gonna take this big dab.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.760]  I was gonna give it to Adam,
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.680]  but I realized how big it is and he doesn't wanna do this.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.760]  He doesn't do that sort of thing.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.960]  I'm a lightweight homie.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.000]  I should ask a question before I take a dab.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.040]  I asked about teas, I asked about feeding.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.280]  It's time to finally train those things, right?
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.600]  If we wanna do any LST training or anything like that,
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.200]  we better do it before they start budding out like crazy.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.120]  Give them some sticks to support themselves.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.800]  I said, support themselves.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.040]  Support with two Ps.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.920]  I guess I'm excited about this dab.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.760]  So tell us about what we need to do
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.040]  and then we will talk about, after that,
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.760]  we'll talk about problems to look for
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.880]  and the biggest fear of all gardeners.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.200]  We'll talk about those two things.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.040]  So I'm gonna take a dab and Jesse will talk.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.600]  God, now I feel like I'm on the spot.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.440]  You are, you are.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.960]  I like how you got the mic right by your face.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.800]  Dude, it's fucking awesome.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.080]  We can hear you so well.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.920]  Nice.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.320]  Let's see.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.360]  Fuck, I'm stoned.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.920]  We're training.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.680]  So if you got the bamboos,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.000]  I kinda like to stick them in the ground at an angle,
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.600]  and then attach the plant at a lower angle on the bamboo
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.080]  so that it's still going past it.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.320]  Are you angling in toward the pot
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.000]  or out from the center of the pot?
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:41.840]  Out from the pot.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.840]  Okay, I just wanted to clear that up.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.880]  I've seen both methods.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.760]  Yeah, so you actually want the bud dangling above the bamboo
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:54.760]  and that kinda gives it a chance to develop its girth
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.840]  and then it's gonna kinda fall towards the bamboo
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.120]  and you wrap it up.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.600]  Kinda predict where it's gonna fall.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.440]  Yeah.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.840]  Also, I mean, just straight up bamboos.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.960]  With outdoors, make sure you tie your plants
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.080]  in at least two places.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:16.040]  The wind, once you start pinning plants with bamboos
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.640]  and stakes and stuff like that,
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.400]  you know, you put them, you know, this applies indoors too,
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:28.960]  but make sure you get them tied up in two places real good
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.280]  so that anything doesn't break over.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.000]  That was such a stone ramble.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:35.840]  That was perfect.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.320]  You said exactly what needed to be said
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.160]  while Adam and I both got to take a dab
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.800]  and kinda get our shit back together
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.520]  because that gave us big dabs.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.640]  See, now I'm kinda new to the bamboo sticking
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.560]  just because I never had plants big enough
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.600]  to even need stuff like that.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.520]  For sure.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.360]  I kinda asked him,
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.760]  he told me the same thing the other day,
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.080]  and I asked him, you know,
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.880]  what's really the purpose of it?
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.400]  And he's like, you know, just to hold it there.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.160]  Now I have a tomato cage and I went out
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.840]  and I purchased the only sticks that were
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.000]  because, you know, living here in Colorado,
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.560]  things are not quite as available
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.400]  as you think they would be.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.640]  Never sold the fuck out.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.680]  Yeah.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.360]  So I had to, you know,
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.280]  I got little ones with the little rings in them
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.040]  that I can just hold up my side
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.360]  because those are the only ones right now.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.920]  And I figure I can just tie it with a loose string.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.280]  I got some branches coming in, you know,
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.840]  just holding it up against the tomato cage.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.680]  So.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.080]  I mean, yeah, that's sounds like it's working for you.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.280]  Yeah, I mean, if nothing else, you can, you know,
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.680]  at maybe an earlier stage,
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.760]  run them through the tomato cage or.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.760]  Yeah, that's.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.200]  Yeah, the way you did it is perfect though.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.280]  The only thing that Adam did wrong is he tried
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.800]  to put the tomato cages on a little late.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.120]  So he had to struggle with that.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.520]  Next time I'll show you a really smooth trick.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.360]  Okay.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.480]  It just takes like a, I use a twisty tie
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.240]  or a fucking like a pipe cleaner.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.760]  They're called fuzzy sticks.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.480]  You just grab the plant from the bottom and go up
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.560]  and then just tie that shit in a couple of spots.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.480]  Then you get a slightly cage on.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.800]  For the size cages I got,
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.000]  I think it was still a little too late for that.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.680]  Cause I tried that trick when I went out
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.720]  and bought the last one and it was just like, no, no, no.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.280]  So I just stuck it down in the middle
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.760]  and it kind of branched it all out.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.440]  There you go.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.760]  You can also cut them open
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:14.320]  and then just wire them back together.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.440]  See, Jesse's a thinker.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.360]  Jesse's a thinker.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.800]  Didn't think about that.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.120]  But next year I plan to have the small square
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.160]  fence lines around it maybe.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:27.840]  For sure.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.680]  Yeah.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.840]  That's something that I've been seeing a lot lately
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:34.920]  on YouTubes and you know, so.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.000]  I actually tomorrow have to try to put one
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.800]  on one of those monsters.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.640]  The outside one.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.560]  I actually sell a 16 inch tomato cage that comes apart.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.040]  The sticks are three different pieces
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.200]  and the cage is two different loops that come apart.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.920]  So you can put that on after.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.640]  I really endorsed those tomato cages.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.840]  Those are fucking useful.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:53.680]  Yeah, they're good.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.520]  Well, they're a good product.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.360]  I like them.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.760]  I actually might've learned about them through sub cool.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.320]  Hey, mine were 99 cents.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.160]  So I can't really complain when it's user error
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.360]  trying to get it onto something.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.200]  All right.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.560]  That was Adam's words of wisdom.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.520]  Yep.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.560]  So problems.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.840]  You guys were talking about moths and worms.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.800]  What the fuck?
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.640]  Yeah.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.040]  They are referred to in America as corn borers.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.240]  And here's a little side conversation.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.440]  They're actually in Europe called a hemp borer.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.720]  When prohibition hit, there wasn't any more hemp plants
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.080]  around, so they went for corn and shit.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.120]  You know, looking up a little bit on here.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.080]  Yeah, I'm Googling it right now.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.320]  Sorry, that's why I'm quiet.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.680]  I know what a hillbilly knows.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.840]  I don't know what he's about to read for us, hopefully.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.200]  The European corn borer.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.040]  All right.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.480]  There you go.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.960]  Well, I'm just reading it straight from Wikipedia.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.000]  The European corn worm or European corn borer,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.800]  also known as the European high flyer,
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.840]  is a pest of grain, particularly maize.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.120]  The insect is native to Europe,
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.280]  originally infesting varieties of millet,
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.160]  including broom corn.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.160]  It's an ugly fucking bug, dude.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.600]  So it's huge.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.280]  Yeah, well, it says the European corn borer
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.880]  caterpillars damage the ears of corn,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.560]  as well as stalks by chewing tunnels,
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.880]  in which cause the plant to fall over.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.680]  Biological control agents of corn borers include,
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.600]  sorry, I'm just gonna read that part.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.720]  But they dig a tunnel in there.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.760]  I can't say it and read it all.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.000]  And then they lay little eggs in there.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.120]  And then it shows these fucking disgusting orange worms
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.040]  that grow out of there.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.960]  This is when I got all freaked out.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:39.080]  Like, what is this dark spot on my plant?
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.240]  This is the kind of stuff that I knew that stuff will burrow
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.600]  and lay eggs inside of, and then rot from the inside out.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.200]  I've never seen them in the stalk.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.920]  Okay, mine were like right at the base.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.640]  They lay clusters of eggs on the leaves,
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.160]  usually the undersides.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.600]  The egg masses or clusters are laid in an overlapping
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.240]  configuration.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.840]  The water would develop inside the eggs,
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.080]  and the eggs become more, yeah, so these things are ugly.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.640]  They eventually turn into a flying insect, I believe.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.480]  Correct?
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.560]  Yeah, well, they fly, they land on the plant,
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  they burrow in or they lay eggs on the bottom.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.480]  Then they turn into these worms that chew on your plants.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.760]  Also, so the original flying thing eats your plant,
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.280]  the new worm they left eats your plant,
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.240]  and then it turns into a flying thing that eats your plant
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.440]  and comes back and drops more of these fucking demon bugs
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.280]  on your plant.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.120]  Yeah, terrible shit.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.560]  And they're like Nazi, yeah.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.800]  Good ways to get rid of them.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.640]  Prevention is the best way I've came up with.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:43.520]  I've spent hours picking them out by hand
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.680]  because they destroy, you know, fortunately,
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.480]  it's not going to destroy an entire crop.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.040]  They destroy a piece of a bud.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.600]  Okay.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.880]  And when you're trimming at the end of the year,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.760]  it is very easy to locate.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.640]  I've spotted those orange worms in there.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.280]  I actually knew a guy that would dry and smoke
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.320]  those orange worms himself through that crop.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.240]  And he's like, those are mine.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.480]  And he loved it.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.320]  He loved it.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.320]  And you talk shit about me.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.280]  Monterey spray has some effect on them.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.120]  That's a great product.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.160]  It contains spinosad.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.080]  Spinosad, that's what I was looking for.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.600]  Our good old friend neem oil,
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.640]  but it really sucks because you're spraying neem oil
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.520]  on a flower.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.440]  I was going to ask,
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.320]  is that product okay with flowers?
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.400]  But I mean, not neem oil.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.720]  I know what neem oil does.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.320]  Yeah. Don't put neem oil on your flowers.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.560]  Monterey.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.760]  What can you do?
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.840]  Yeah. I mean, it's an organic.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.320]  It's a, it's a bacteria.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.520]  Use it as more of a deterrent, maybe?
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.080]  Yeah. That's a, I sprayed my plants with it
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.600]  all through veg.
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.440]  Religiously.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.480]  Preparation.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.520]  Every four days, they got sprayed with something different,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.320]  mixed it up, kept it all organic.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.520]  And yeah.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.560]  So.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.200]  Something to scare those plants away.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.040]  Or those bugs away.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.520]  Sorry.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.040]  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.680]  That's the goddamn truth.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.520]  There you go.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.680]  For sure.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.600]  All right.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.800]  So we've gotten a man.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:16.720]  Fuck the moths.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.560]  That's gross.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.400]  I wonder.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.240]  They're big too, dude.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.640]  They're like the size of a Bic lighter,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.360]  but except triangle.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.120]  So you're praying mantis isn't going to do shit against those.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:25.960]  No, actually.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.520]  No, it's great to watch.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.360]  Yeah.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.640]  I've seen one rip it out of the bud.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.480]  Nice.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.320]  Yeah.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.240]  I'm sure that probably fills up a praying man is pretty good.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:36.080]  Oh yeah.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:36.920]  Yeah.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.760]  Well, they're just fluff anyway.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.720]  And then they get all that moth dust in your mouth.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.560]  Yeah.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.400]  Yuck.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.160]  Gross.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.040]  So yeah, those things are huge too.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:47.880]  I've seen them.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.440]  It's a cool story that you fucking said
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.360]  that they used to be hemp moths.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.320]  Hemp borders.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.200]  Before they were corn,
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.640]  because the wiki didn't say anything about that.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.520]  It's a cool story.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.360]  Well look at the hemp border.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.560]  It probably links me to those.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.400]  Yeah.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.880]  We'll do it just for fun.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.800]  Otherwise known as the corn moth.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.640]  Yeah.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.680]  Yeah, it's going to link you right there.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.760]  Did you mean this?
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760]  You're in America.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.240]  Yeah, actually an old timer told me that.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.560]  There's not a wiki for it,
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.640]  but it's all weed stuff though.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.400]  It's all like nasty bugs, nasty bugs.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.400]  And it's the same picture.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.480]  Yeah.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.920]  Yep.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.760]  Gross.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.880]  Wow, that was a freaky sound.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.960]  Whoever's phone did that one.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.320]  No, is that not anybody's phone?
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.800]  No, that was my phone.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.000]  I don't understand why that's going off.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.120]  I mean, it was dead like forever ago.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.840]  And now I feel like an idiot because it was.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.240]  Still talking to you, bro.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.080]  Still talking to you.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:43.920]  It's all good.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.760]  It's all the way down.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.640]  I'm not going to call you out about leaving your phone
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.040]  on on table during a podcast.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:47.880]  My bad.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:48.720]  I won't do that.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.960]  Completely unprofessional about me.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:53.440]  Now we have talked about moths and worms.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.240]  Other than the obvious problem
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.520]  that you know I'm going to bring up,
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.600]  what are any other problems we can look for right now
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  that we can work with right now we can kind of try to prevent?
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.640]  You know, I mean, it's still pretty early in flowering.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:10.640]  So, you know, spider mites are going to come up.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.800]  Don't fucking say that word.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.600]  Yeah, I didn't want to hear them either.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.840]  And you know, if you don't have a lot of air circulation
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.400]  and it gets moist and I mean,
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.160]  it creates the conditions for powdery mold.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.680]  Plan for the worst.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.080]  All right, so get the,
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.880]  damn I can't remember any brand names tonight.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.280]  Actinovate, that's stuff for ox.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.480]  Is that for powdery mildew?
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.320]  Yeah.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.240]  Okay, Actinovate.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.080]  Yeah.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.080]  Jesse shouts that out.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.440]  I'm testing a product called Witch's Brew.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.120]  Well, as soon as I find a situation to use it in,
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120]  not to be a dick,
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.600]  but yeah, it's called Witch's Brew.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.040]  And supposedly it just like totally annihilates
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.760]  powdery mildew, but it's totally organic
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.280]  and made in up in Denver somewhere,
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.320]  or maybe Boulder, you know, up north somewhere.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.000]  So, and it's cheap too.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.840]  A lot of you guys are, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.680]  No, you're cool.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.800]  You look like you might need a hand.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.680]  A lot of you guys are not in places
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.400]  where you're able to walk into a hydro shop
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.720]  and be like, yo, I need fricking a whole big bottle
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.920]  of Spinosad, sorry.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.600]  Hit the volume button on the wrong way there.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.000]  Fucking what's up?
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.760]  You can't be like, I need a big bottle of Monterey spray.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.240]  So, that's actually it.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.080]  Go ahead, bro.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:30.920]  Say what you're going to say.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.760]  No, no, I'm just looking.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.600]  Oh, okay.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.440]  I thought you were going to say something.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.280]  Side note real quick.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.440]  You can get a Monterey at a Home Depot.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.720]  That's where exactly where I was headed.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.200]  You guys are in Tennessee, Georgia, Florida,
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.560]  that might, I don't condone your growing.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.480]  I can't support that.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.320]  Don't fucking do that illegal against the law.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.160]  That's up to you.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.760]  But if you happen to be doing that,
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.080]  because I can't condone it, I can't support it.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.480]  Vote for the right to do that.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.560]  Yeah, but I'll go to jail if I say,
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.320]  hey, you in Kentucky, grow fucking weed.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.040]  But if you insist on doing it,
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.640]  you can get your products at Lowe's and Home Depot.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.280]  If you're really careful about what you do,
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.720]  look for that Omri certified shit.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.480]  There are a few products that Monterey spray
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.320]  that we were talking about.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.800]  It just says Monterey insect spray.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.480]  It says contain Spinosad right on the bottle.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.640]  Spinosad kills a lot of insects
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.560]  that you'll find in the garden.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.240]  Yeah, it's organic, it's safe.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.760]  Neem oil is also out there.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.360]  Neem oil is there for veg.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.120]  You should use neem oil and veg often.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.280]  It's your friend.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.440]  It's cheap, it's affordable.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.680]  You can dilute it.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.320]  And you're really not gonna hurt anything
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.560]  unless you use it in flour.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.400]  Yeah. You can spray
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.240]  the ground around it.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.760]  I saw a product, I can't remember the name,
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.640]  but it contains white oil.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:36.800]  It's a little tiny bottle.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.600]  It's nine bucks.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.880]  It's got some white oil in it.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.120]  I have not used it yet, but I'm sure
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.440]  that that would knock out your flying insects
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:47.080]  and mites really quickly.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.120]  I'll have to research the name,
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.320]  but look for it, guys.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.840]  If you need some stuff,
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.520]  you can actually get your products
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.200]  at a Home Depot or Lowe's or something similar.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.400]  Just be careful.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.800]  Don't be discreet.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.520]  Don't talk about your weed
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:00.840]  when you're at any store,
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.920]  even the hydro shop.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.680]  The only place you can talk about your grow
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.080]  is in your grow or at your table with your crew.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.120]  We're talking about problems in a garden right now.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.800]  We're talking about bugs and shit.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.440]  One more thing is fucking homies and shit.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.520]  Be careful who you tell.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.440]  Everybody's your friend today,
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.480]  but in like a week when you guys have the stupidest fight
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:21.520]  over the dumbest song on the radio
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.000]  that reminded you of that girl,
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  oh, you were with her too?
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:24.840]  Fuck you.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.160]  Now you're not friends anymore.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.000]  He's got a grow, officer,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.200]  or we're gonna steal his grow.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.480]  Just shut up about your grow.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.560]  Everybody knows everybody in Colorado grows.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.440]  There's so much of it here
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.400]  that it's not as threatening.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.320]  It's not as crazy.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.520]  Everyone's growing their own crops here,
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.200]  but you guys that are in those other places,
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.920]  just be careful with your grow.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.600]  Go ahead, man.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.760]  I might've grown a plant or two before medical,
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.760]  and there was no such thing as talking to anyone about it.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.440]  Yeah.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.560]  Anyone at all.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.640]  I remember that vibe.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.800]  When you go to the hydro shop
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.320]  before everybody had a medical card,
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.120]  it was dead silence.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.600]  You could hear the cashier going,
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.240]  as she rung up your shit in the hydro store,
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.760]  and she'd mumbled numbers
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.400]  because she didn't want Jesse to hear
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.160]  how much I just fucking spent at the hydro shop.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.360]  Even write it on paper.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.200]  Uh-huh.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.280]  Yep.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.560]  Or the classic, no, never.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.800]  I'm not even gonna do it.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.240]  Are you gonna say when you run into friends
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.080]  at the hydro shop,
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.440]  if you and I used to run into each other,
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.080]  hey bro, can I get a cut of that white widow?
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.400]  Sure, I'll trade you for that great,
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.560]  oh, fuck, we, psh.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.680]  The shop owner will tell you to shut up in there.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.440]  That never happened to me, at least back then.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.920]  And I'm just, yeah, that's what we'll leave it at.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.800]  Yeah, all right.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.000]  Jesse's got a horror story
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.560]  he's gonna share with me after the podcast.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560]  Coming from out east,
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.800]  anything that I ever had outside
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.120]  and was like, yo, check this out, it was gone.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:45.960]  Yeah, one of those guys.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.120]  And I'm gonna tell you right now,
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.200]  no, yeah, it's always your friends.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.240]  I mean, that's, I'm here to tell you right now,
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.080]  nine times out of 10,
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:52.920]  if something's stolen from you,
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.880]  it's somebody you know.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.720]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.320]  It's somebody you bragged about.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.800]  So you just, you know, keep it quiet.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.640]  Yeah.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.240]  Don't bring girls to your spot if you're growing.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.600]  No one, yeah.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.920]  They don't know what to look at anyways.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.600]  So that's what you, yeah,
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.960]  but well then they just talk randomly.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.120]  If they don't have any business being there,
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.200]  don't bring girls.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.600]  If you're just trying to be cool,
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.360]  don't bring girls to your grow to be cool.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  That's a failure.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.560]  I've seen women bring down grow rooms.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.320]  Yeah, until the pot's harvested.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.560]  Like I love you ladies.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.440]  I love the loyal ladies that are loyal to their man,
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.720]  but some of you girls don't know when to stop talking
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.760]  about the grow room that you saw.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.920]  And that's not your fault.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.760]  I may or may not.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.880]  That's that guy's fault for taking you to the grow room
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.160]  without knowing you well enough.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.680]  I may or may not have had a plant snapped in half
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.880]  a couple of times.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:44.440]  All right, so this leads us to something
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.240]  that we all dread other than the police.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.680]  In Colorado, we don't worry a lot about the police anymore.
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:50.560]  We all obey the law.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.960]  We either have a medical marijuana card or we are an adult.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.320]  In Colorado, any adult over 21 can grow six plants.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.340]  I think you're allowed to grow six plants at any house.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.200]  I don't know that if Jesse and I lived in the same house,
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.680]  I don't know if we could grow 12 outside.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.520]  I don't know how that works,
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.640]  but as a medical marijuana provider,
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.000]  a lot of us have increased counts.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.240]  You look like you might have something to add to that.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.680]  I've heard it does.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.720]  Okay.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.440]  But I don't want to be accused of giving anyone legal advice.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.560]  Yeah, follow the rules on yourself.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.200]  I'm in that spectrum, you know what I'm saying,
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.520]  of where I'm allowed to have six plants,
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.960]  but I'm allowed to have three flowering
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.280]  and three not flowering.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.600]  Right, that's the law in Colorado.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.680]  You can have six plants, three in flower,
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.960]  three not in flower.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.280]  I don't know the freaking logistics or whatever,
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.720]  the bottom end, the fine print.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:38.440]  I don't know if Adam and I and Jesse live together,
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.160]  can we do 18 plants in the backyard?
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.160]  I'm not sure.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.600]  They seem to kind of be up on that
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:44.560]  and they kind of seem to cock block a lot of those moves.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.760]  They're smart in Colorado, they're catching on.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.240]  Anyway, we digress.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.960]  Jesse's walking, so he's tiptoeing
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.160]  and his Jordan's through the kitchen
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.760]  trying to get a bottle of water.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.000]  I actually heard a rumor that Pueblo County
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  is going to instate a 18 plant limit per household total.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.360]  So that could happen.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.520]  That sounds like shit that Pueblo does.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.960]  But yeah, so we're allowed to have six plants.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.160]  God, you just fucking changed my whole thought process.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.000]  I don't like it.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.280]  We're going to have to go political.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.120]  Well, I got a set in with the town hall meeting
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.520]  the other day with Sal Pace.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.240]  It was pretty much, he was campaigning for himself,
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.840]  but someone brought up marijuana
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  and he was real quick to bring up the fact
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.640]  that they're planning on instating that.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.200]  And so I've already called him twice
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.200]  and I left a message at the end of the town hall meeting.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.200]  Yeah, a lot of you guys that grow
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.580]  those little tiny hydro plants are like six inches tall.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.840]  You wouldn't be able to get shit off of 18 plants.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:51.680]  I need clarification.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.880]  Yeah, I want clarification.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.160]  It was, he just talking recreational and stuff like that.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.680]  And we're caregivers.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.840]  I've got patients that rely on, that's okay.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.580]  Yeah, we'll bring that up on further episodes, you guys.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:04.160]  We'll get into this and figure out what's going on.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.620]  So far, it's just at the start.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.740]  We've talked about bringing the wrong people to your grow.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.020]  We've talked about trying to impress chicks.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:15.420]  Here's the biggest fucking problem, thieves, you guys.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:17.660]  People are going to steal your outdoor weed.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.300]  It's going to happen.
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:21.080]  If you grow for three years in a row,
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.860]  one of those years, you're not going to get a harvest.
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.560]  It's going to be fucking stolen.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.700]  Take a break.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:28.640]  That's the old school rule.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:32.180]  Do two times, take a break, find a spot.
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.100]  Yeah, okay.
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:34.940]  Man, that's hard.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:35.780]  That makes sense, yeah.
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.620]  Come back two years later, a year later.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.740]  Okay, yeah, because next year,
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.020]  they're going to know that crop is there.
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.140]  They'll go and look and they'll be like,
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.600]  oh, it's not here to give up.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.460]  All right, so thieves are going to come to your garden.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:49.020]  I don't even want to talk too much about this story.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.420]  It's just something that needs to be mentioned.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:51.580]  Recently in our community,
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:53.420]  a 13-year-old boy was shot in the back
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.980]  because he was attempting to steal
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:57.360]  somebody's outdoor marijuana grow.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.540]  That dude was arrested.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:59.460]  He's in fucking jail.
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:00.860]  He's going to go to court.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.020]  He shot that person in the back.
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.220]  I wasn't there.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.700]  I'd like to point out this was a pellet.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.540]  Oh yes, it was a pellet.
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:06.820]  It was a high caliber pellet gun.
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:07.660]  The pellet is now-
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.740]  This was not an actual firearm.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.500]  Right, but the pellet is lodged in this kid's organs
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:16.260]  and he had to be taken to Denver Children's Hospital
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.100]  to be rescued.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:17.920]  He almost died.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.760]  He's in critical condition.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.860]  I'm not on either one of these guys' sides.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:23.060]  I'm not on the shooter's side.
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:24.100]  I'm not on the kid's side.
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:24.940]  The kid was a thief.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:25.760]  He was in the yard.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.660]  He was actually, the newspaper said he was out of the yard
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:29.700]  and he shot him in the back,
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:33.300]  but we're just going to act like that he was right next
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.100]  to the pot plants in this story.
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:36.220]  Think about this.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.060]  It's fucking three in the morning.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:39.620]  He was part of a gang as well.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.460]  Okay.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.280]  I'd like to point out.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.460]  Yeah, if there's multiple, then you got to-
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.180]  So he's the one that got it then.
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:45.460]  Yeah, he's the one.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.300]  The slow one.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.140]  So let's put this story,
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.900]  let's put everybody that's listening to this
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:49.900]  that has an outdoor crop,
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.980]  I want to put this story in their heads right now.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:54.260]  It's three, you've got your pot plants outside.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.240]  It's like seven days before you cut them down.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.500]  You've got a hard on.
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:58.580]  You're just fucking drooling.
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.980]  You're rubbing your hands together like a porno
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:01.860]  is about to start.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:04.000]  You're fucking drooling like food is cooking.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.300]  You're about to go on the ride of your life.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.460]  You got your outdoor crop about to come down.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.540]  It's three in the morning.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.820]  You get woken up to the dogs going nuts.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.780]  You get woken up to the fucking lights coming on.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.460]  You look on your security cameras that hopefully you have.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.060]  We're going to talk in a couple of seconds
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:19.540]  about things to do to prevent some thieves,
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.180]  but I want to set this story here.
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:22.260]  What are you going to do?
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.300]  Those alarms are going off.
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.980]  The asshole's up on your security camera.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:26.620]  You can see him cutting down your plant.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.660]  It's a fucking 19 year old kid.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:30.580]  He's wearing a black hoodie.
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.380]  You can't tell who he is.
[01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:33.580]  He's cutting your shit down, dude.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.340]  He's about to run out of your yard.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:38.100]  If you're in Colorado, like a 90% chance
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.340]  there's a gun in your house.
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:42.360]  Probably you've got a baseball bat.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:44.780]  If you're a camper, you got a machete.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:45.700]  Think about what you're going to do
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.900]  because it could happen to you.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:50.100]  And you could walk out there and put yourself
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:53.340]  in a more dangerous situation than what you're ready for.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.920]  You could walk out there and be like this guy in our town
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.880]  that shot somebody and has to deal with a kid
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.580]  that could die right now.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:01.080]  And I don't think that that kid's life
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.120]  was worth anything in my house.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.760]  If you want something, I'll let you have it
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:05.600]  and I won't kill you.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.840]  And that sounds like something fucking stupid to say,
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.520]  but if you need it that bad, it's not worth killing you for.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.360]  I'll make more money.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.280]  I'll grow more next year.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.120]  Leave my mother plants and my seeds where they are.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.040]  We'll be just fine.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880]  Well, you have it like that.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:21.160]  Whereas somebody like me who is depending,
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.680]  you know, on those three plants,
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.280]  not only for me, but for my old lady, you know,
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.280]  it would be rough for that.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.880]  You know, I would be spending money every week.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.160]  Well, that's why I'm trying to put that story
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.200]  in these growers' heads now,
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:35.560]  these new folks' heads that haven't had to deal with this.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.520]  Let me break it down from the suspect's perspective.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.920]  He's, you know, he got woken up at 2.30 in the morning.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:47.920]  He grabbed a BB gun and he shot someone in his yard
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:53.420]  protecting his plants in an effort to protect his plants.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.620]  Well, the cop showed up because he shot someone
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:59.580]  and the cop saw his plants and he shot someone
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:03.700]  and the cops realized that he valued his plants
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:05.920]  more than he valued human life.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.940]  So now he's sitting in a jail cell
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:12.660]  because these people otherwise didn't, you know,
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:14.140]  intend to harm him.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.060]  Yeah.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.260]  Well, I'm highly conflicted on this.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.100]  I don't know where this is.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:19.300]  Yeah, that's why I tried to not,
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.500]  I said, I'm not taking a side.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.260]  I wasn't there, but I want our listeners to kind of-
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:24.940]  Even if he gets away with it,
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.180]  his face has been on the paper.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:28.260]  His plants are still there.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.100]  Everyone in town knows they're there.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.540]  The cops won't touch them
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:34.620]  because they're not going to maintain that evidence.
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:37.260]  So he's going to have to spend lawyer fees.
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.660]  He probably lost his job.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.320]  His dad's been on the news.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.820]  And even if he gets away with it all,
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:45.100]  he still lost his plants.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:45.940]  Was it worth it?
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.380]  No, not at all.
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.420]  And a little boy has, I mean, so.
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:53.980]  Just don't do it.
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:55.220]  Yeah, even thinking that,
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.300]  oh, I'll just get him with the pellet gun.
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.860]  Like, you know, you just coming out the door
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.060]  with the pellet gun, they were running.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.900]  You can get yourself shot doing that.
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.740]  What if he's got a real gun?
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.580]  Exactly.
[01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:08.740]  You know, and that's the other thing.
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.580]  That's what I said.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.060]  You can walk out and put yourself in worse danger
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:12.340]  than what you were prepared for
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.140]  to deal with for those plants.
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.580]  And if you love your dogs, don't turn them out either.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.540]  Yep, yeah, I agree with that.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.380]  Like, it sucks, man.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:21.220]  It's happened to me.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:22.060]  It fucking sucks.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:22.880]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.020]  If you interrupt them, they're gonna run off.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.940]  Yeah. Hopefully.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.020]  Well, yeah, hopefully.
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:27.860]  Hopefully.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.700]  Let them go nuts.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.520]  Turn the lights on.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.360]  Yeah, flicker them, bitch.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.700]  If you can get a good look at the situation,
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:33.660]  try to scare them off.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:35.460]  You know, maybe you got it elevated.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.460]  You know, maybe you can walk out on a back balcony
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:38.500]  or something like that.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.820]  You know, just scaring them off,
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.140]  you know, throwing a rock at them.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.460]  I don't see, you know.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.300]  Yeah, throw a rock.
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.140]  Fuck yeah. Get the fuck out of my yard.
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:46.140]  Always, if someone's in your yard,
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:46.980]  throw a fucking rock at them.
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:48.980]  Hell yeah, I like that idea.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:52.500]  I mean, if you know your dog's got the situation, you know.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.180]  You can still literally hit somebody in the head
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.620]  with a damn hand-sized rock
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.540]  and probably do some real good-sized damage.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:58.380]  That's true.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.860]  That's true.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:02.020]  Yeah, so, guys, that's my point is think about,
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.180]  be prepared what you're gonna do,
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:05.140]  because I don't want you to have to,
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:06.820]  the only way to be prepared for that situation
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:09.100]  is to think about it today while I'm telling you about it,
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.780]  so that when someone's in your yard stealing your shit,
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:13.140]  you don't panic and shit your pants.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.520]  Hopefully, if you prepare for it and think about it,
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.380]  you've got a plan of action.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:18.580]  You know how to get out there quickly.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.140]  You know how to get rid of a thief.
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:22.500]  I don't want anybody to try to be a hero for a pot plant.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.260]  I don't want to hear about anybody else
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:26.140]  shooting more people for weed plants.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:27.940]  We don't need that kind of publicity.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:28.780]  Things are going great right now.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:31.700]  It's not gangster to go to jail for, you know.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:32.540]  Anything.
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:33.380]  You're a weed grower.
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:34.820]  Don't put that on the industry.
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:39.820]  Yeah, just, yeah, we don't need that, so.
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.940]  In Colorado, we shouldn't be growing enough
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.580]  to make it worth robbing us, which, that sounds weird.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:49.600]  And don't, we're not defending thieves.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:52.900]  No, we're saying take the high road.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.700]  Yeah, they are the lowest.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.460]  We work so hard for what we have,
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.940]  and in one night, in a couple hours,
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:02.820]  they take it all away from you.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:05.180]  And they leave it scattered down in your alley,
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:08.020]  so you have to clean it up at eight o'clock in the morning.
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:11.020]  And your neighbors finally realize what those,
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:12.900]  it's just, it's not worth it.
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.740]  Yeah, I've had one plant taken from me.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:16.200]  I've grown one plant outside.
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:17.660]  Guess how many I got taken from me?
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:19.000]  One fucking plant.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.920]  I lived in a snazzy neighborhood.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.080]  That plant was in a nice backyard tucked away.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.400]  I think the gardeners are the ones
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.720]  that fucking took that thing.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.560]  Yeah.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.760]  I have never grown in my own yard before,
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.360]  or anything like that.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.920]  And the year I tried it, it got taken, so.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.480]  Three plants, so.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:38.440]  Damn.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.880]  So I guess we've scared the shit out of everybody.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.720]  Just be prepared, guys.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.400]  I'm not, I don't know what you're gonna do.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.480]  I don't want you to shoot people.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.500]  I don't want you to fight people.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.620]  I want you to protect your crop peacefully.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.660]  Use your voice.
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:50.020]  Scare the shit out of them.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:50.860]  Put your firearms away.
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:52.100]  If you look outside and it's your cousin Earl,
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:53.340]  beat his fucking ass.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:54.340]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.140]  Well, I was gonna make the example,
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:00.020]  if you're stealing Adam's plants and he catches you,
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:02.460]  Adam's fucked if he walks out and tries to stop you.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:04.460]  If Adam's stealing your plants and you catch him,
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:06.260]  Adam is fucked if you try to catch him.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:07.420]  Yeah.
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:10.460]  The array of outcomes could be very broad
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.620]  if there's a thief in your yard,
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.720]  because, but then again,
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.020]  me knowing that I'm going to steal his plants,
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.580]  I'm probably not coming with just my little skinny arms
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:19.420]  either, you know what I'm saying?
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:21.100]  And, but you're going to his house,
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.860]  so you know he's got more than his big ass arms in there.
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:24.700]  Well, and that's just the thing.
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:26.140]  And that's where this all just keeps going.
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:26.980]  It escalates.
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:27.820]  Yeah, yep.
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:28.640]  Very quickly.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.480]  And it is not worth it.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:30.700]  It's just a plant.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.540]  Yeah.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.020]  Jail is the bottom line.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:36.140]  You should put some outside next month or next year.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.820]  Yeah, try again next year.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.740]  Grow indoors.
[01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:39.740]  So don't shoot thieves.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:40.580]  That's my advice.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:41.460]  Please, jail sucks.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:42.920]  You don't want to go to jail.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.120]  We need to talk about,
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:46.640]  if we don't want to lose our plants and shoot people,
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.140]  how can we prevent this?
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.120]  Dogs, right?
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:51.960]  Big dogs.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.480]  Keeping dogs in your backyard.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.720]  Keeping them through at night.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.480]  Don't, if you're going to use them as security,
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.920]  don't leave them, you know, don't, you know,
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.520]  these are working dogs.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.880]  They need to stay outside,
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:05.680]  have a good dog house, it's summer.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.500]  Yeah.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:07.340]  Yeah, it's the summer in Colorado.
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:08.760]  They should be outside protecting their shit.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:10.440]  Once again.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.520]  I like a mixture of big dogs and little dogs.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.120]  Yeah, those little yapper dogs.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.080]  They wake up the big ones and then it's on.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.200]  Yeah.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.360]  The big pit bulls will come do business.
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.240]  We've got one.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.680]  He doesn't sleep during the night, during the summer.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.920]  He's just gotten, I don't know.
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:29.760]  Trains.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.600]  Yeah.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:31.760]  He knows.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.680]  Yeah, he knows that those crops are important.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.600]  So also if your dog bites somebody,
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.000]  you're going to have to fucking deal with that.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:37.840]  Yep.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:38.660]  They're going to take your dog.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:39.560]  They're going to put your dog in quarantine.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:42.360]  Make it doesn't have, make sure it doesn't have rabies.
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.040]  If your dog really eats the shit out of somebody,
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.040]  hopefully it doesn't come to that.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.360]  Hopefully, I want to use two dogs as examples.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.760]  If I got into a yard and Soraka Nana rushed me
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:53.920]  and barked at me, I would be gone.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.080]  I'm not a very good runner,
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:59.020]  but I would run a record lap with those two dogs behind me.
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:00.780]  So hopefully that's all you got to do.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:01.620]  Yeah.
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.580]  Lights and cameras are your best friend.
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:06.460]  Lights and cameras are anybody's best friend.
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:07.660]  If you live in a sketchy hood,
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:10.040]  put some lights and cameras up on your house,
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.640]  floodlights and cameras.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.080]  And once people see those cameras,
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:14.480]  they know and they're like, I don't even.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.800]  Motion sensors.
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:16.640]  Yeah.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:19.520]  Mount them high enough so that an animal
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.040]  isn't going to set them off.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.320]  There you go.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.160]  I live in the city.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:25.480]  There's a couple little tricks you can do with them.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.560]  If that animal is big enough to set off a motion detector
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.360]  over here, we got to fucking shoot it.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.560]  I got deer right across the house.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:34.220]  You know what you're talking about.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:35.360]  You know, those deer may come have a snack
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.280]  on your plants one day.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.120]  You might want to keep an eye on them for that.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:39.440]  That could very much happen.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.120]  Putting the dog out there, believe me.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:42.480]  Deer know what's good.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:43.320]  You know?
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.140]  Yeah.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.680]  I don't know if they want my weed.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.800]  You've been eating good that week.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.600]  I got one plant that smells like Skittles.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.200]  The other three or the other two are just like, eh.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.720]  Nah, it's early still.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.920]  They shouldn't have much of a lot of aroma yet.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.000]  So have you guys ever hung bells on your plants?
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.360]  Just like their Christmas decorations?
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:01.920]  Is that effective?
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:02.760]  It would be.
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:03.600]  It would be.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:04.420]  Thieves are cowards.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:05.800]  It doesn't take much to scare them off.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.640]  Okay.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.160]  Especially, I mean, put yourselves in their shoes.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:10.360]  They're in someone's backyard.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.280]  They do not know in the middle of the night it is.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.720]  And they're doing something.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.360]  You know, they're breaking two or three rules
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.000]  and laws and all kinds of shit.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.680]  It's not going to take much to spook them.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.840]  And it's likely somebody you know,
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.520]  so they don't want you to see their face
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.360]  or their clothes or their body language.
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.640]  Don't tell anybody about those either.
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:29.360]  Like, you know, tuck them up in there.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.200]  Tuck them in.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.240]  Another, when mine got taken,
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.520]  they were heavily, heavily bambooed.
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.360]  I had, you know, kind of made a big old fricking bush
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.820]  out of one little thing.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.200]  The bamboos actually played,
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.280]  it was hard for them to pull the plants out.
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.120]  Oh, I bet.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.920]  You know, I still had, you know,
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:54.840]  a couple of branches left to each one, but you know,
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.000]  so those bamboos serve a couple of purposes.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.240]  Jesse brought up, oh, go ahead.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.600]  You might be leading to what I was going to say.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:03.040]  If they ever tripped and fell on some, you know,
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.640]  that really sucks.
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:07.440]  It worked good for the VC, so.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.680]  A great point Jesse brought up earlier, guys.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.760]  Be friends with your neighbors.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:17.120]  Be a friendly, polite, courteous neighbor.
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:18.280]  Keep your yard clean.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.600]  Keep your backyard clean.
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.680]  Keep your music down.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:22.120]  Keep your grow discreet
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.960]  and make friends with your neighbors.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.000]  And if you think they're legit,
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.680]  you can almost let them know you're growing
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.160]  and not have to hide that shit and maybe share with them.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.680]  Smoke out your neighbor and then they'll know
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.200]  that that dank crop in the backyard,
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.440]  they got to keep an eye on it too.
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.200]  And then maybe they won't steal it from you
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.440]  because some neighbors will jack your shit.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.080]  But then maybe if someone does come in the yard,
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.120]  they'll help you out also.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.280]  They'll keep an eye on that shit
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:46.880]  because they know that they've been keeping an eye on it.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.200]  Maybe you'll throw them an ounce or two when it gets done.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.880]  Maybe they'll come over and help you trim, you know.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:52.720]  Be neighborly.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:54.120]  Our neighbors on the farm are like that.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.400]  That's, yeah.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.240]  That's farm neighbors.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.080]  That should be that way.
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:57.920]  True, true.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:58.760]  That's a little different.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.440]  You guys aren't living in the city.
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.080]  Yeah, it's a whole new ball game now.
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.000]  So I made a little spike shape on my paper here
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.360]  to remind me to talk about something.
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:08.640]  A lot of you guys are going to set some kind of weird
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.720]  booby traps or some kind of things
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.080]  for the thieves to get hurt.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:12.920]  Don't do that.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.640]  Yeah, we can't condone that.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.920]  That's just like shooting somebody.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:17.080]  It's just like letting your dogs out.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.040]  You're going to get in fucking trouble for that.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.400]  You can get manslaughter.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.060]  I think it's also, some places called man trapping.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.760]  Don't do it.
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:27.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.000]  And it really, really pisses cops off when they see it.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.920]  Because they think, oh, I could have stepped in that.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.480]  Especially if you're in an illegal state.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.560]  What if they arrest you at the front door,
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.800]  and they lead you to the car,
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.360]  and they just go walking around back, and it's dark?
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:44.200]  I mean.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.040]  Just step on whatever you put down there.
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.640]  And then you've just assaulted a police officer.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.120]  Not doing anything.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:49.960]  You're handcuffed.
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.200]  Yep.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.040]  Completely.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.880]  If you're doing things like this,
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.640]  you've probably got a substantial crop,
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:00.320]  and you're probably doing a lot of things wrong.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:03.120]  You're not really doing anyone but yourself.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.360]  There's those, somebody showed me a Google map.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:06.760]  I might've talked about this.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.240]  A Google map where there's a community in NorCal,
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.960]  where you can tell the same dude set up
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.640]  like seven lots of housing.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:17.240]  It's like, Jesse owns one lot, Adam owns another,
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.440]  I own another.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.040]  But since we're all allowed to have them.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:22.080]  Yeah, they just subdivided all this land,
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.360]  and set up gigantic crops.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.000]  And it looks like you built all of them.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.040]  It looks like one guy set up all these crops
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.560]  for all these families.
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:31.600]  So those guys have a lot on the line, man.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.560]  What if somebody goes in there,
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:35.920]  and tries to take 10 of those plants?
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:37.480]  They've got a lot to fucking lose.
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:39.320]  Those are five, 10 pound plants each.
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.320]  Yeah.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.040]  I would hope at that point of scale,
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.520]  you can pay two dudes to sit around with flashlights.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.040]  Someone's awake at all hours of the day.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.960]  I don't even want to set up the scene for a shitty movie,
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.200]  but that's a lot of money on that mountain, bro.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.040]  Yeah.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:57.120]  There's a short window when it's done,
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.000]  and not harvested, but could be cut,
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  when the growers are trying to let it get
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:01.480]  that final few days.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:02.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.520]  And man, just a few, the three of us could,
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.480]  and it always seems to go in.
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.800]  Can you imagine the amount of work?
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.440]  I mean, all of it.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:13.040]  The house, dressed out here, sorry to cut you off.
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:13.880]  No, you're good.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:15.880]  I'm horrible about cutting people off.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.320]  Could you imagine just like all the,
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:21.960]  the work. The tension in your head.
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:22.800]  Yeah, everything.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.120]  You show up that morning like,
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.840]  oh, good, oh shit.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:29.480]  There's a half a acre of fucking plants just missing.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.680]  So another thing that can help you from getting ripped off,
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:36.440]  I wrote this real big, we talked about it, be discreet.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.120]  Always.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.960]  Quit showing everybody, quit talking about it.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:43.240]  It's so much fun to post Instagram pictures
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.640]  and shit though, man.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.680]  But, but if there's a way to take pride in your work though,
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:52.760]  you know, like save all those pictures
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.680]  until the stuff is done, you know,
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:57.000]  and then maybe say, look what, you know,
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.480]  this is the buildup.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.040]  You don't have to post to Instagram
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.480]  under your real fucking name either.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.320]  There it is.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.920]  I'm not even gonna call out a couple of people that do it,
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:04.920]  but I know where you live
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.400]  and I know where your backyard's located.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.760]  And I see those gigantic plants on your Instagram.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.080]  I'm a nice guy.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.440]  Not all of your friends on your friends list are.
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.360]  Yep. Yeah.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.200]  That sucks.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.040]  Yeah.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:15.880]  Yeah.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:16.720]  I just think that's.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:17.600]  I have mine on a select few.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:18.840]  That's taunting people.
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:21.200]  That's, yep.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.560]  Don't show geographical landmarks in your pictures.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.920]  Tell her your house, stuff like that.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:27.760]  Yeah.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:28.760]  The mountain in the background.
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.600]  Yeah.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:30.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:33.800]  All right.
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.720]  You guys got anything to add?
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.120]  We're gonna finish this part up
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.280]  if these guys don't have anything to add.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.160]  And then Adam and I are gonna come back.
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:40.000]  We're gonna go,
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.840]  we're recording on a fucking Thursday right now.
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:45.200]  Saturday, Adam and another friend and I
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.160]  are gonna go see Joe Rogan at the Comedy Works in Denver.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.480]  Smoke crack, Joe Rogan.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:50.680]  I don't think we're gonna do that,
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:52.280]  but that is what Adam just said
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:53.320]  with the funny look on his face.
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:54.960]  They're definitely gonna be,
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:58.680]  Joe Rogan is recording his next Comedy Central special
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.520]  at Comedy Works Saturday night.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.680]  And I was lucky enough to score some tickets.
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:04.040]  So.
[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:05.160]  And thank you, by the way.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:06.720]  I mean, I can't thank you enough.
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.560]  Yeah, you're an inspiring figure.
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:10.000]  I wanna see some iRegenetics shirts
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.920]  in the crowd when they watch the show.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.080]  And that's what I was trying to say.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.080]  And you know what I got told?
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:15.920]  Mm-hmm.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.840]  I said, they're 20 bucks.
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:17.680]  Yeah.
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.280]  Yeah.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.280]  So I'm looking for that 20 bucks.
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.640]  As soon as I find that, then we'll get the iRegenetics shirt.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.480]  But if you guys,
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:26.120]  so Adam and I will be back in a couple of minutes.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.360]  We're gonna take a couple of dabs
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.480]  and wrap up this portion of the show.
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.640]  If you guys got anything fun to say
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:30.640]  for the end of this part,
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:32.160]  go ahead and shout it out right now.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:33.400]  If you wanna shout out anybody cool,
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.240]  if you wanna give them a-
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:35.840]  I did not get to shout out two people
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:38.320]  that listen back East.
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.120]  My homie Stumps and QP James.
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.840]  I know they both listen, so.
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:43.680]  Who's Dickfoot?
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.520]  Is that one of your friends?
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.340]  Dickfoot?
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:46.760]  I don't know a Dickfoot.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:47.600]  Shout out Dickfoot.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:48.440]  I think that's his name on Twitter.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.280]  Shout out Dickfoot, dude.
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.120]  That's a hellacious Twitter handle right there.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:52.960]  You know?
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:00.800]  And of course that Apothicana that you recommended,
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.200]  said my mom said she's really helping her out.
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.040]  So good.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.320]  Good.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:07.880]  Any shout outs over there, bro?
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.000]  I know you're not that shout out guy, but.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.080]  Yeah, I'm stoned.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.280]  Shout out to Organics.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.120]  Yeah, Organics.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.840]  Organic as fuck.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:19.320]  We did not include Ras Cola and Queen Cola
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:22.080]  in our shout outs on last episode on 25.
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:22.920]  So.
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.280]  That's what I'm saying too, because I forgot.
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:25.120]  We're gonna be doing a lot of those.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.320]  I want that guy to come explain some shit to us.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.320]  Ras Cola, if you listen to the show, bro.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.160]  Hit me up.
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.640]  We'd love to have you on the show.
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:34.640]  I know there's a way you can get in touch with me.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.480]  He works for the company.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.920]  He would probably make that happen
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:39.160]  whatever time he could do it.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:41.600]  Yeah, I'm available 36 hours a day.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.000]  So, Sean, if you're listening, bro, come on the show.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:44.840]  We'd love to have you.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.760]  We'd love to hear you talk about Organic as fuck.
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:48.240]  I know that's how you roll.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:49.440]  I could learn from you.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.200]  The listeners could definitely learn from you.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.120]  We'd appreciate you on.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:54.800]  So, the listeners, you guys hear me
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.960]  inviting somebody really cool on.
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.080]  If we get him on, you'll be proud.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.680]  He really knows what he's doing.
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.360]  He's actually ran a pretty cool little
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.000]  urban farm kind of deal before.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.080]  So, that's, he's a, yeah.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:08.920]  He's super stoked on Organics.
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.240]  He's got a cool, real cool story.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:12.000]  So, he's a cool dude.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.520]  Yeah, love to have him on the show.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.760]  You can bring the lady if you want,
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.960]  if that's still happening.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.000]  Sorry, I haven't seen you in a long time.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.240]  So, hope I'm not touching on a sore subject there.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.920]  Shout out to her either way.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.760]  She was always fun to dab with.
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:25.800]  All right, guys, it looks like it's time
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.680]  to wrap up the dab portion of the show.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:29.800]  I am gonna give one quick shout out to Dreadful J.
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:30.640]  What's up, mama?
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.480]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.360]  Thanks for all your support.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.000]  Grow those seeds with all your love.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.240]  We're gonna take some dabs.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.840]  We'll be back in just a couple of seconds.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:38.680]  Listen to the music.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:40.280]  Shake your booty, get down.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.120]  All right, guys, thanks for joining us
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.400]  for another Grow episode.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:45.600]  I wanna give Jesse a huge thanks for coming out.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:46.760]  I hope you guys learned a whole bunch.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:48.200]  Hey, Adam, did you learn anything, bro?
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:49.040]  I sure did, man.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.200]  You look like you're dabbed out over there.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:51.040]  I am fucking high.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:51.880]  Nice, nice.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.320]  Speaking of fucking high,
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.320]  we had a super great time last night.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:57.360]  Adam, myself, and a little friend of ours
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.880]  got to go see Joe Rogan record his next
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.880]  standup comedy special for Comedy Central at Comedy Works.
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:07.120]  What'd you think of that show, bro?
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:07.960]  I loved it.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:08.800]  I loved it.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:10.640]  What'd you think of that show, bro?
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.680]  It was awesome, dude.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:15.400]  I've never seen a professional comic, so to say,
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:16.240]  you know what I'm saying?
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.320]  Besides when we went up to Denver, but it was great, man.
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.120]  I woke up and my cheeks and my ribs
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.000]  were still sore from laughing so hard.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.280]  Absolutely, my cheeks.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:25.240]  Yeah.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:27.000]  Tony Hinchcliffe opened up for Joe Rogan
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  at Comedy Works last night.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.240]  He did 15 solid minutes.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.280]  Every second of his set was ripping.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:34.800]  Yep, he was a funny dude.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.840]  I've never heard of him before,
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.200]  but he was definitely an interesting comic.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.200]  He's a little dark, he's a little twisted.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:41.880]  And that's, you're grinning, you're like,
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.280]  yeah, that's right up our alley.
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.240]  So that was perfect.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.760]  And then of course, Joe Rogan is a legend.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:48.440]  He crushed it.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.320]  He came out a little bit nervous, I felt like, but.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.400]  He used it.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:54.200]  He harnessed that, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.600]  He grabbed that energy.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.240]  And then somebody tried to heckle Joe Rogan
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.720]  about 10 minutes into his set.
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:00.840]  And that's when he calmed.
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.120]  He totally broke free of the bubble of,
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.160]  I'm recording a show, and he kinda chewed that lady.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.080]  A tiny bit of a chewing of a new asshole.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.920]  He just made her feel really stupid for a second,
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:11.840]  like a comedian should do, and went back about his business.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:15.200]  I had a hell of a good time, so shout out to Joe Rogan.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.520]  That's gonna be a great comedy special.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:19.240]  Comedy Works is a great setting, man.
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.680]  Isn't that a great setting?
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.040]  It's a great place.
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.640]  Yeah, we ate dinner at a place called the Something Mushroom.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:26.600]  Do you remember the name, bro?
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:27.720]  The Mellow Mushroom.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:28.880]  The Mellow Mushroom, yeah.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:29.960]  That place was dank.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:31.280]  That pizza was delicious.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.800]  Our server was pretty chill.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.400]  It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had, for sure.
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:37.360]  I'm not really a big pizza fan.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.720]  Yeah, you ate all the way to the end of the crust
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.560]  and everything, right?
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.400]  I ate all of it.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.280]  Yeah, we killed that large pizza between the three of us.
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:46.000]  It should've been enough pizza for four people,
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.880]  but three high people.
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.480]  Had nothing to do with the dabs
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.840]  before the show, the pregame, but hey, whatever.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.680]  That was a good time.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.960]  Hey, shout out, if you're listening,
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:57.200]  a guy named Phil approached me after the comedy show,
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.800]  and he asked me if I was the guy that owns the Seed Company,
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:01.440]  because I mean, I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks,
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.520]  and I'm wearing an iRegenetics t-shirt
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.640]  in the middle of downtown Denver.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:07.120]  He's like, do you own that Seed Company?
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.080]  I was like, that's me, dude.
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.160]  So Phil, if you're listening to the podcast,
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.040]  if you founded the show, congratulations,
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:13.200]  and thanks for your support, bro.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.040]  That was really cool meeting somebody
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.320]  that just knew me from my Seed Company
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:19.000]  and my Instagram and Facebook presence.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  That was kind of cool.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.640]  So shout out to Phil.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.480]  Bro, do you have anybody you need
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:25.280]  to give a shout out to in this episode?
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.000]  No, man, that's pretty much it.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.240]  The guys I hit up.
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:29.760]  Cool, I feel like we kind of rambled
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.120]  on the Joe Rogan part for a second.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.760]  Shout out to our friend Angela that got to join us.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.880]  I had a good time with you, Angela.
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:35.840]  Thanks for coming to pizza
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.280]  and being a really cool passenger.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:38.560]  That was fun.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:41.040]  I guess we're gonna wrap up the show.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.760]  If you guys ever get to go see a show at Comedy Works,
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.600]  go check it out.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:45.440]  It's a good time.
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.260]  Doug Benson will be there.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.120]  Look, I'm giving Doug Benson a plug.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:48.960]  Doug Benson will be there.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:51.540]  If you guys are pot smokers and you live in Colorado,
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:53.040]  go see Doug Benson at Comedy Works.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.960]  I think the date is September 15th.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.120]  It's a Monday.
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:57.400]  I will be there.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.640]  Maybe we can arrange a little smoke session.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.600]  If you wanna do that, tweet me about it
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:04.160]  at I Grow Culture on Twitter
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:07.020]  or email me, I Grow Culture at Hotmail.com.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:10.200]  Or of course, find me on Facebook under I Grow Culture.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:13.400]  And we can smoke out at the Doug Benson show
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.400]  after the show, not in there.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.560]  You can't smoke at Comedy Works.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.280]  They will kick you the fuck out.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.680]  I've got a note here that says, watch your mouth.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.600]  I'm trying not to watch,
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.800]  or I'm trying not to cuss so much.
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:23.960]  I know that's one of my downfalls
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.360]  of being a great podcaster.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.020]  I'll quit saying the F word a lot
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:29.920]  because it's really not good class.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:30.840]  They're not good taste.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:31.960]  So I'm gonna try to quit.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  I, on the other hand.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.640]  You can talk like a fucking pirate if you want.
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:36.680]  You're not the host of a show.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.920]  Yeah, arg.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:38.840]  Arg.
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.080]  Shout out to all of our pirate friends.
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:42.320]  All right, guys, we're gonna wrap it up.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.320]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes,
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.880]  search for I Grow Culture, find the review section,
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:49.100]  give us a five-star rating.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.160]  After that, type in a comment
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.720]  and let me know what you think of the show.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.160]  If you're listening to us on Stitcher,
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.600]  please leave a comment there and give us a good review.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.800]  All those reviews help the show move up in the rankings,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.160]  which in turn gets us more listeners.
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:02.400]  I wanna spread my message to everyone
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.600]  who needs help or wants Grow information.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.240]  We have about 1,000 listeners
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.800]  on the past couple of few episodes we've put out.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:12.240]  1,000 people are hearing us.
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.000]  I think 1,100 listeners on episode 24.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  By the time I looked, the stats are a few days behind
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.460]  because it takes a minute for the analytics to get there.
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.200]  But there were 1,100 listeners on episode 24.
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.520]  And this is the night we're recording 26.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.320]  So it takes them two weeks and we get 1,100.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:31.320]  In the first week, we usually get about 800 listens.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.940]  In the first week an episode is posted.
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:33.780]  So I wanna give-
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:34.600]  That's so awesome, man.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:36.080]  That's a lot of people hearing our message.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.400]  So I wanna give a huge thank you
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.600]  to all 1,100 of you that are listening.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.440]  Absolutely.
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.880]  But I want you guys to do me one favor.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.320]  1,100 of you are listening.
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.800]  Everybody tell two of your friends
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  about the I Grow Culture podcast.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:52.320]  Just say, man, I was, you know everybody grows, smokes,
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:53.760]  loves weed, has something to do with weed.
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.080]  You all know two stoners.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.040]  Or if it's your mom and she's afraid of weed,
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.720]  she can listen to us, be semi-educated.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.880]  And we're good people.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.200]  We preach a good message.
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.280]  On the last part with Jesse, we said, don't shoot people.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:07.120]  Absolutely.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:07.940]  So we're good people.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:10.080]  You can break myths, you can educate people.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.780]  You can, if somebody's lonely
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:12.880]  and wants someone to listen to,
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.840]  we've got great radio voices.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:15.680]  I'm just fucking-
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.000]  Absolutely educate people.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.360]  Anytime you can.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:19.480]  But yeah, you can spread the word.
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:22.520]  So all 1,100 of you, 1,000 of you,
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.660]  1,500 by the time this episode posts,
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:26.580]  all of you guys tell two people.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:28.940]  And that way, if one of them listens to the show,
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:30.480]  then we got 3,000 listeners.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.860]  And that's when iTunes and Stitcher
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.900]  really start paying attention
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:34.620]  once you break that 2,500 marker.
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:37.540]  And that's all the ratings is really doing.
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:39.660]  I mean, it tells people that the show is good,
[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:41.060]  but more than anything else,
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:45.980]  it helps your relationship with iTunes or Stitcher.
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:47.620]  But when it moves us up in the ranking,
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.220]  it shows people that we exist.
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.540]  And then it's like, it's just our brand has more integrity.
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:53.620]  If more people are listening,
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.020]  people say, oh, people are listening.
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.060]  It must be worth listening.
[02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:58.260]  And so, you know what the,
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:14:59.980]  when you're seeing a killer band,
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:02.740]  nobody wants to dance until that first idiot dances.
[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:03.740]  Just dance, guys.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:04.580]  Yep.
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:05.420]  Yeah.
[02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:06.860]  If anything that I've learned from Colorado
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.060]  is just get out there and dance
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:09.780]  because there are people far behind.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.920]  Yeah.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.260]  Nobody wants to be the first dancer,
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:13.860]  but those fifth and 10th dancers,
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:16.020]  those guys are all gonna love you for breaking the ice.
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:18.060]  So just let's just, I'm not begging.
[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:18.900]  I just wanna, you know,
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.100]  let's just get the show moved up there.
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:20.940]  And that way more people-
[02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:21.780]  Love, man.
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.180]  More people can learn how to grow high-grade cannabis,
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:26.140]  less people will be afraid of cannabis,
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:29.580]  and more people will be properly educated about cannabis
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:32.140]  and the things that go with cannabis.
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:32.980]  That's my goal.
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:33.800]  I wanna-
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:34.740]  You preach a good message, brother.
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:35.580]  I wanna big up the weed.
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:39.060]  Well, I feel like I'm an ambassador to the plant now,
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:40.540]  to the whole industry and to the movement.
[02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:42.720]  I kind of speak, I'm the voice, you know?
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.380]  There's a few of us that have podcasts
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:46.180]  and we're starting to be recognized
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:47.460]  and I wanna be-
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:48.300]  You're helping.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.180]  Very positive for the plant.
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:50.780]  Yeah, I don't wanna be a bad vibe for the plant.
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.820]  I don't want people to think I'm a stupid pothead.
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:54.820]  People do, because I take fucking gram dabs
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:57.020]  and I have dreadlocks, but that's just that, you know-
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:58.340]  You prove them wrong every day.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.180]  Well, thank you.
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:00.000]  That's really appreciated.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.220]  Guys, I thank you guys all for listening.
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:02.560]  I'm ranting and rambling again.
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:05.100]  So don't forget the show's available on iTunes,
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:08.440]  Stitcher, Swell.am, and also every episode,
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:09.700]  all the way from episode one
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.940]  is on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:13.380]  Somebody told me today,
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.020]  a friend of mine that I just met in person today,
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.380]  another listener, what's up, Dustin?
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.780]  Shout out, bro.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:19.820]  Dustin was saying he listens to episode,
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:21.620]  he was listening to episodes one and two,
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:23.520]  and he's starting to go from the very beginning,
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:25.420]  and he will catch up while he gardens.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.260]  So what's up, bro?
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:30.460]  In quite a while, you'll hear this shout out on number 26.
[02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:31.540]  26, 27?
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:32.380]  Binge.
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:33.860]  26, yeah, we're on 26.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:35.900]  All right, so what do we do at the end?
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:38.100]  We give a big old shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:38.940]  What's up, bro?
[02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:39.760]  Love you.
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:40.600]  I was supposed to come hang out tonight.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:41.820]  I got tied up doing a podcast.
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.660]  We went a little later than expected.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:45.020]  So a big shout out to my ninja, Spence,
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.540]  in the Garden of Weeden.
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:48.060]  Huge thanks again to all the listeners.
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:49.160]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.400]  Take a fat dab.
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:51.800]  Hey, Adam, thanks for coming.
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:52.840]  So take a fat dab.
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.240]  Give your mama a hug for me.

[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.620]  It's the hustle.

[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.160]  Thanks for joining me.
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.920]  Got a very news-filled episode for you guys this week.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:53.600]  Joining me across the table is my buddy, Adam.
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:54.440]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:55.260]  What's up, man?
[02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:56.600]  I am high.
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:58.200]  I'm certainly not low.
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.040]  Thanks for joining me tonight for another episode, bro.
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.960]  Absolutely, man.
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:02.640]  It is 420 and we are doing it right.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:03.880]  We are doing 420 right.
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:05.640]  We had a little 710 with our 420,
[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:08.200]  smoking a big old fat joint of some Heart of Gold.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.360]  Loving this afternoon.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.080]  Anyway, this episode will be filled with a bunch of news
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.400]  and some chatting because this weekend,
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:19.280]  the weekend that just passed by the time this comes out,
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:20.240]  this will be out on a Monday.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.740]  That means that the weekend,
[02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:24.960]  I got to see Phish at Dick's in Denver
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:26.620]  and they played all of my favorite songs
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.280]  and we had a wonderful time.
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:29.840]  So that's my prediction.
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.520]  Hopefully that comes true.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.560]  So let's get to some ads real quick here
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:36.800]  and then we'll get into some news.

[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:34.320]  and then we, Adam and I are gonna come back
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.420]  and review a little bit of news.
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:37.520]  We haven't done the news in a while.
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.560]  So we're gonna get you nice and caught up.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.940]  I'm gonna turn up Nick a tee for a couple of seconds
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:42.880]  while I take a dab.
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:45.600]  Adam, if you wanna say anything, now's your chance, buddy.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.360]  No, I'm pretty good right now.
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:48.640]  You know, and the way you look,
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:51.080]  it may be best if you just keep your head down right now,
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:51.920]  bro.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.400]  All right, I'm here people.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:54.240]  He's there.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:56.560]  He's, no, I'm not even sure he's there, you guys.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:57.680]  Hang on, I need a dab.
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:24.400]  ♪ Every yellow and a new D1, chicken and a double C. ♪
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:26.760]  All right, I wanna give a huge shout out to Spence
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:28.680]  and the entire Garden of Weeden crew.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:32.160]  I'm dabbing some live resin.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:33.680]  What's strange is that I'm so high, I just took a dab.
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.640]  I can't even remember what it's called.
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:37.680]  Yeti OG.
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:39.120]  It's the Yeti OG, thanks, bro.
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.120]  It's written on there, but it's upside down over there.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:41.960]  I can't see it.
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:43.760]  It's Yeti OG live resin.
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:45.520]  It's dank, it's so high, I couldn't remember the name,
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:47.600]  or it's so dank, I couldn't remember the name of it.
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.160]  I'm all dabbed out right now
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:50.480]  and everything sounds like I'm in a tunnel.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.040]  It's epic.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:53.440]  I just said the word epic.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:55.400]  All right, guys.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.040]  I am going to cough my brains out
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:02.400]  and then we're gonna scroll to some news.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.400]  All right, check this out.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:07.560]  This news I found entertaining.
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:09.880]  This is coming from the Cannabist
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:13.720]  and it is by Ricardo Baca from the Cannabist staff.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.400]  The topic says, pot shop owner,
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:20.000]  80% of our customers come from out of state.
[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:23.160]  Adam's over there shaking his head.
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:24.280]  You're an out of stater, bro.
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.120]  I am an out of stater.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:25.960]  You're out of state.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.800]  ID qualifies you as out of stater.
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:30.080]  But I'm no longer an out of stater.
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.320]  You know, I'm a resident.
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:32.840]  I've been here longer than six months.
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:35.000]  Yeah, but they don't realize that when they check your-
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.080]  No, totally not.
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.080]  But I just, I feel that because I'm a red card patient
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:45.000]  and the place that has my card
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.160]  or the place that I like to go to anyways,
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:52.160]  my preferred place is now recreational and it's a line.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.280]  There's a line to get in, to get your meds?
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:55.480]  It's the same place.
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.760]  You know, they can only take the same one,
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:00.640]  two people back at one time and it's the same building.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:01.480]  Same-
[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:03.720]  How long does that line take you now?
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:05.680]  I haven't been out there since they've really done it
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:06.800]  besides one or two times.
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.680]  And one time I've walked right in there
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.920]  because there was nobody on there.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:12.840]  But the other times there's been five or six people
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.760]  ahead of me and people walk in behind me
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.480]  and they're like, oh no.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:17.880]  And they just turn around and walk out.
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:19.160]  Yeah, that's a long time to wait.
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.760]  We used to have a shop downtown.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.160]  They're not hurting for the business.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.720]  People would wait in line for an hour
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:26.080]  because the whole front of the place would be full.
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.880]  All right, I'm going to get into this article a little bit.
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:32.920]  Ryan, it says Ryan Griego owns a recreational pot shop
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:35.200]  in Southern Colorado.
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:37.800]  And he's putting out a bold informed estimate
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:41.440]  saying that a decidedly clear majority of his customers
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:42.880]  are from outside of Colorado.
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.800]  I'm going to take a big breath here
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:46.160]  because I can't even read after that dab.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.680]  I think the dispensary this guy is from is actually,
[02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:50.920]  they posted a really cool shot of the Cana Sewer
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:52.560]  in this article online here.
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:54.840]  A really cool angle of the sign and the building.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:57.960]  Stylish looking place with a great Colorado background.
[02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:59.440]  Is that a dope shot?
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.320]  A dope shot, right?
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.320]  Ha ha ha.
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:03.040]  I didn't even mean that pun.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:04.240]  All right, I'm back on my game.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.080]  Let's go.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.320]  80% of my customers are coming from other states,
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:09.600]  predominantly Texas, New Mexico, Kansas,
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:12.840]  and Arizona said Griego, owner of Cana Sewer
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:15.320]  in Pueblo West, which opened its doors in May
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:17.520]  for recreational marijuana sales.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.840]  I knew there would be out of state customers coming in,
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:22.640]  but I thought it would be more of a 30, 70 split
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:25.160]  with 30% of my customers from out of state,
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:28.520]  but it's more severe than that on the flip flop.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:30.520]  I don't think severe was the right word.
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:33.600]  Out of state tourists account for 44% of all retail sales
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:37.160]  in the Denver area and about 90% in mountain resorts,
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:39.040]  such as Aspen or Telluride.
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:40.560]  According to a recent study produced
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:43.200]  by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.600]  Guys, we've talked about the Marijuana Enforcement Division
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.880]  or the MED.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.920]  They're the guys, the division in charge
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:52.600]  of regulating the dispensaries and the grows
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.440]  and all of that stuff.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.240]  They are in charge of the marijuana
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.040]  and they regulate all of that stuff.
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:02.040]  They make the rules and they are also a branch of the IRS.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.480]  So that's pretty legit.
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:04.320]  They're a huge place.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.640]  They make a lot of rules.
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:08.600]  They fucking put their foot down and it matters.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.360]  Guys, tweet me every time I say the F word.
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:12.840]  Every time I say fuck, just tweet me
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:14.280]  and tell me to stop doing it, please.
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.560]  I'm trying to stop doing that on the show.
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.400]  Trying to cut that word out of my vocabulary.
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:20.960]  It's not even a cool word to use for anything.
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.100]  But anyway, but for a shop in Pueblo hardly considered
[02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:27.720]  in the same tourism league as Aspen or Telluride
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:30.200]  to make 80% of its sales to out of state visitors
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:34.400]  is something of an anomaly, even given Pueblo's proximity,
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.000]  less than a hundred miles to the New Mexico state line.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.600]  They're not joking at all about the differences
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:42.880]  between Aspen, Telluride compared to Pueblo.
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.240]  Pueblo is, it's a cool place if you live here
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.080]  and you know where you're going,
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:49.400]  but it's a steel town.
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:50.300]  It's a steel mill town.
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:51.960]  It's a blue collar working man's town.
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:53.780]  And Aspen and Telluride are places
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:54.980]  where you go to spend some time.
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:58.000]  We don't have, we have a reservoir here.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.120]  We've got a river walk here.
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:01.400]  We've got some really cool trails and things.
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:03.840]  There's a castle about 30 minutes from here.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:05.960]  I mean, Pueblo is definitely nice to come and see,
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:07.760]  but there's nothing here to like,
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:11.000]  Pueblo has this.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.800]  It has everything that a normal town has and it's pretty.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:14.640]  That's.
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:15.460]  Yeah.
[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.080]  So to say that 80% of our sales are going
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:19.880]  to out of state visitors is kind of shocking.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:22.560]  Well, we have a lot of recreational weed shops here
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:24.680]  and the shop that you're talking about
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:26.600]  is 100% recreational.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.680]  So.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.240]  Do you think that the numbers are the same
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:32.420]  across the board at the shops, at the rec shops,
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:33.480]  that it's 70, 30?
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:35.280]  I think it depends on your product.
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:36.120]  That's true.
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.080]  And that's something I was going to get at.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.680]  Because the reason that the Colorado market
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.720]  is not shopping at a recreational shop,
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:44.560]  we're either, and I haven't read this article
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:45.440]  in advance very well.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:48.280]  I skimmed it because I found it interesting for the show.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:50.580]  I think that a Colorado resident, like you did,
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:51.520]  you became a resident,
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:54.080]  you got your medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor.
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:54.960]  You've got your red card.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:56.640]  Now you can shop at a medical shop
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.920]  and not pay the 25% tax that's added onto the rec weed.
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.160]  And probably you get better herb there,
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.520]  I think at the med shops,
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:09.400]  but also most of the Colorado residents have been here
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.040]  and we have a guy or a caregiver,
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:13.240]  or just, you've got the hookup already.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:14.640]  Or you start growing your own.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.600]  Or you're growing your own.
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.640]  I used, I literally used the rec shops
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:20.720]  and until I got my red card.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:22.680]  And then once I got my red card,
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:25.600]  then I used it all the time.
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:26.440]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:28.200]  I went into the rec shop
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:29.840]  with somebody who just came here recently
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:31.640]  and I was looking for a certain product.
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:34.720]  And that's, I went in there because for one,
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:37.040]  she had never done it before and it's an experience.
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:39.160]  You know, everybody should go.
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.480]  Yep, there you go.
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.680]  Stuff is amazing.
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:44.560]  I've got a bottle of Apothicanna,
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.680]  extra strength pain cream,
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.060]  Arnica, peppermint, juniper, cannabis.
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.400]  This stuff, I have said on this show
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:56.680]  that I'm skeptical of topicals and lotions and such.
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:58.420]  24 bucks.
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:01.720]  This was actually kicked down by the Grammy Gatsby to me
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:04.140]  because I mentioned some shoulder pain.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.400]  I had a guest over the other night
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:10.560]  who looked like hell when they were sitting at the table,
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:12.120]  didn't look like they felt good.
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:12.940]  And I was like, what's up?
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:14.080]  And they said, neck hurts.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:16.400]  And put some of this on my hands
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:17.820]  and rubbed her neck for about 10 minutes
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:19.720]  and my hands were high.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:22.760]  My hands felt balloony.
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.080]  I hate to quote Pink Floyd,
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.000]  but my hands felt just like two balloons
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.920]  after rubbing a girl's neck with that stuff.
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.820]  Yeah, I can only imagine what that girl's neck felt like
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:32.720]  after I rubbed that.
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.560]  I bet she was chilling.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:35.760]  She just slathered it all over her legs
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:38.200]  and then like, you know what I'm saying?
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:40.520]  And she was talking about, it's just one, that one hit.
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.240]  No, it wasn't that one hit.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.720]  The person you shared it with.
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:45.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.020]  Adam shared some Colorado cannabis
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.760]  that I grew with a lightweight
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:51.600]  and that kind of wrecked their world.
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:52.440]  Yeah, that's funny.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:53.920]  All right, I'm gonna get a little back into this article.
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:55.120]  We got high and got distracted.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:56.740]  Shout out to the person that got a massage
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:00.080]  with the freaking cannabis Arnica, peppermint, juniper,
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:02.440]  cannabis lotion from Apothecary.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:04.880]  Huge shout out to Grimey Gatsby.
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:06.840]  You guys don't even know,
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:08.360]  he's behind the scenes working shit
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:09.720]  and you don't even know it.
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.360]  This article continues to say,
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:14.900]  so how did Griego land at these figures,
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:17.000]  especially given the state of Colorado's restrictions
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.720]  on tracking recreational customers information?
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:20.560]  Ooh.
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.060]  We keep seeing these statistics
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:25.240]  and that's a question I've raised twice now.
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:26.080]  All right.
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:26.920]  Once, and this is the second time
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:27.900]  somebody has raised it for me.
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:28.740]  Go for it.
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:30.080]  But you've already explained it
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.280]  where they're not tracking your name,
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:35.640]  so much as they're just tracking your purchase.
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:37.880]  He comments on it.
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:38.700]  So he says,
[02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:40.400]  we have a media group that we hired on
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.160]  and they monitor all of our social media
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.320]  and Google analytics.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.920]  And we've paid close attention
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.040]  to the progression of people searching on PCs
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:49.420]  and mobile devices, Griego said.
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:51.720]  A lot of these numbers come from inside the store.
[02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:54.280]  Everyone has to show ID and we check IDs twice,
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:57.160]  once in reception and again in the dispensing area.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:29:59.880]  Plus our bud tenders are always making friendly conversation
[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:01.880]  asking people where they're from.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:04.400]  Sure, 80% is Griego's educated guests,
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.800]  but while he knows he sees traffic locally,
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:10.560]  as well as from nearby weedless Colorado towns,
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:13.760]  Colorado Springs, Walsenburg, Trinidad and La Junta,
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:17.560]  he said, he says definitively that he sees more Texans
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:19.000]  than anybody else.
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:21.560]  That's a big state though.
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:22.960]  Our bro Kevin works at a shop.
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:25.080]  He's not here tonight, but he works at a dispensary.
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:25.920]  He said the same thing.
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:27.560]  And he says it's a lot of Texans.
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.400]  Yeah.
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:30.280]  Not surprisingly, the out of state customers
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:32.840]  are also spending more than the Coloradans he said.
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:36.040]  I wanna know what you guys are paying for herb.
[02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:38.040]  You might've, we did this on my Facebook page
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:39.000]  on the iReed genetics.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.640]  I wanna know what you guys are paying herb in your location.
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:43.540]  Tweet me at iGrowCulture.
[02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:45.400]  Let me know, give me a good,
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.960]  don't tell me exactly where you are,
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.120]  but just let me know what state you're in,
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:49.720]  maybe what part of that state
[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:51.520]  and let me know what good high grade herb
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:52.760]  or whatever herb is available.
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:54.720]  Let me know what it costs.
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:59.400]  I'll tell you in Colorado, I don't go to the shops, dude.
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:00.280]  Do you know what an ounce?
[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:02.480]  Kevin knows what an ounce, actually we had a friend,
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.680]  I think she said it was 460.
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:08.640]  Yeah, recreational, that's right about the high end of price.
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:10.360]  As a caregiver, my patients.
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:12.580]  You can find them for 350 if you shopped around
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:16.080]  and it wasn't really like, I want this quality and this,
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:18.000]  you know, you can still find it cheaper
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.360]  depending on where you wanna go, recreational that is.
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.560]  All right, so I wanna know what you guys are paying.
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:26.040]  On the street right now in Colorado,
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:27.680]  ounces, depending on what you want,
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:29.760]  you can find an ounce for $150.
[02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:32.240]  It's not the dank, it's not the chronic, maybe.
[02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:34.880]  What'd you buy it for medical for, 150?
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:37.080]  But for the fire, it's about 200 bucks,
[02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:39.680]  225 for a good dank ounce right now in Colorado.
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:42.080]  Just depends on, you know, if you're just random dude,
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:43.160]  if you got the hookups that you're going for.
[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.600]  I would rather go 50 bucks, believe me.
[02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.720]  Just go that extra 50 and get that dank,
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:48.880]  that top shelf kush.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:52.320]  Yeah, if you gotta go to the dispensaries and get it,
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:54.960]  it's gonna run you close to $500 an ounce
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:58.320]  for that same 225, $200 ounce.
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.600]  Wow, all right.
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:03.400]  It makes sense, but, and I guess it's the Colorado people
[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:06.120]  are getting that stuff that the caregivers are growing
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:07.560]  or their buddies with the caregiver grow
[02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:10.000]  or having some extra on or something.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.320]  All that private kush is a little bit better
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:14.080]  than the shop weed, I think.
[02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:17.360]  It's harder for someone to get on with a caregiver,
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:18.800]  you know, especially if you don't have
[02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:22.040]  a medical debilitating condition where, you know,
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:25.920]  I'm not medical because I'm in a wheelchair,
[02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:27.760]  that's for sure, you know, or I have cancer.
[02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:29.480]  It's just knowing somebody that you trust
[02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:30.960]  and want to assign as your caregiver.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:33.040]  So here's something we kind of skipped over, guys.
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:34.720]  We were talking about caregiver and stuff.
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.600]  When you get a, and now actually the word
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:38.160]  is now provider in Colorado.
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:39.000]  Correct.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.240]  When you're, back in the day it was caregiver,
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.800]  but that was, sounds confusing.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:44.080]  When you get your medical marijuana recommendation
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:45.560]  from a doctor, there is no license.
[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:47.520]  It's a recommendation, it's not a prescription.
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.400]  They recommend that you use medical cannabis
[02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:50.880]  and they sign papers.
[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:53.840]  And you send that paper into the Colorado State Registry
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:56.080]  and they send you back a card that is a registry card
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:58.120]  that says you are registered with the state of Colorado
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:32:59.920]  to use medical marijuana.
[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:01.080]  When you fill out your paperwork,
[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:03.720]  you are allowed to sign, designate a person
[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:04.960]  that is called your provider,
[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:06.640]  which used to be your caregiver.
[02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:09.960]  This person, the paperwork says they have to be responsible
[02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:14.240]  for something other than just procuring your cannabis.
[02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:17.040]  So you should drive them to their medical marijuana
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:17.960]  doctor's appointment.
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.960]  You should probably make them a kale smoothie
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:21.920]  and work on their fucking person.
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:23.440]  I said, fuck again, somebody tweet me
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.880]  and tell me to stop doing that.
[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:26.600]  I'm trying, I got a note in front of me still,
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:27.520]  watch your mouth.
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.120]  So you make them a, you go, you spend time with them.
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:31.960]  You make them a shake.
[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:33.560]  You try to deal with their overall wellbeing.
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:35.760]  And if you're a caregiver, I think sitting like you and I do,
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:37.080]  we hang out, I'm not your caregiver,
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.080]  but when you're having a bad day,
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:39.280]  when something's driving you nuts.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:41.560]  I got my red card the same day you renewed
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.080]  and you were there with-
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:44.480]  With a couple of my patients, yeah.
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:45.320]  Absolutely.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:47.520]  And I hang out, you can tell that one of the guys
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:49.640]  is an older cat, he's a 60 year old guy
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.080]  and him and I, he's my bro because like you come
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.560]  and sit on the table, sit at the table
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:55.200]  and you're having a bad day and we talk
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.800]  and you feel better about that.
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:59.640]  Some people that have AIDS, cancer, major shit.
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:00.680]  They don't have those people.
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:01.800]  They just need someone to talk to
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:03.160]  because a lot of people are afraid of them.
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:05.040]  Once you're sick, people abandon you
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:06.160]  or you just need extra-
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:07.320]  They gotta distance themselves.
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:08.520]  We need extra support.
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:09.560]  You need extra support.
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:11.920]  Even if those people are there, you can always use.
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:14.520]  I'm a young, energetic, youthful dude with a good attitude.
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:17.040]  I just spit right across the table at you, my bad.
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:17.920]  I apologize for that one,
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:21.080]  but I didn't say fuck about it till now.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.760]  I just tweeted.
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:25.400]  So I think being a caregiver, that's part of it.
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:28.400]  Going in, I write down spiritual counseling on my,
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.080]  when they say, what else do you provide?
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:32.200]  I make smoothies and shakes for these guys.
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:33.200]  I drive them to their appointments
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:36.520]  and I provide spiritual counseling, just being your friend.
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:39.080]  But so the caregiver is a person that is responsible
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.120]  for providing your medicine.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:44.840]  The actual Colorado law does say that they are allowed
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:49.840]  to charge you money to cover the cost of your labor
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:51.840]  and your lights and your expenses,
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.080]  but you're not supposed to profit off of caregiver,
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:58.040]  your caregiver ship, your provider ship.
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.960]  So yeah, so you can be a caregiver in the state of Colorado.
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:04.200]  All you have to do is decide that you wanna be a caregiver
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  and learn how to grow
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.400]  and then find somebody that trusts you enough
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:10.520]  and then work out something with them.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:13.480]  The dispensaries, I don't think,
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.160]  or the centers don't give you a good deal.
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.680]  They just give you a little bit of a discount.
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:21.120]  My guys, they're people that I'm responsible for.
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.080]  Right now, there are four people
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:24.880]  and I know pretty much exactly how much,
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.440]  I can predict when they need medicine.
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.760]  I'll be sitting around one night and go,
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:30.440]  oh, it's about time for patient A to give me a call tomorrow
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:32.120]  and I'll put them a little package together
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.640]  because I know what he needs and when he needs it.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:36.640]  Not only that, but that way they kind of have
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:41.200]  more of a specific and exactly what they need,
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:44.240]  you know, high CBD, high THC.
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:46.320]  Exactly, I grow that Tora Bora cut.
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:47.680]  Exactly.
[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:49.880]  The night nurse was bred for a specific person.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.880]  His two favorite strains are Grateful Dog and Tora Bora
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:54.920]  and I bred them together basically
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:57.280]  to make the perfect medicine for one of my patients.
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:35:58.120]  Absolutely, man.
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:35:59.120]  I went that far for this guy.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.360]  Plus I know it's gonna be a killer strain,
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.480]  but I mean, he inspired that strain.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.600]  You're not probably not gonna go wrong with it
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:07.480]  and even if you do, you know, it's a test.
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:08.680]  It's all an experiment.
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:09.520]  It's sitting there on the table
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:10.960]  if you wanna give that thing a little smell.
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:12.560]  Yeah, I've smelled it.
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.640]  It's fantastic.
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:14.480]  Well, thank you.
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:15.600]  That's the night nurse.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.440]  It's definitely frosty.
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:20.240]  But DNA Genetics lets me use their Tora Bora.
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:21.640]  They gave me permission to breed with it.
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:24.080]  I've got their award-winning cut.
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.520]  They let me use that to breed to the Grateful Dog
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:30.240]  and it came out pretty stanky.
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:31.440]  Smells well.
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:32.720]  I'm gonna run a bunch of testers
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:35.000]  and maybe one day we'll put that to market.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:35.840]  I definitely like the taste of it.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.520]  You can find that at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.720]  Because I'm more of the indica smoker,
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.080]  more of the sativa guy.
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:46.120]  What's weird about me, I like indica flowers.
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:47.000]  If I'm gonna smoke a joint,
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.120]  I want it to make me sit down and chill out.
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.280]  And like, well, I just want,
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.240]  a joint seems more like sitting in a hammock
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:54.080]  with my feet up,
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.080]  with the little dreadlock girl cuddled up next to me
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:59.080]  and some Grateful Dead on the radio and a nice breeze.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:00.240]  That's smoking a joint.
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:02.840]  Dabs are like taking shots.
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:03.760]  I don't drink alcohol,
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:05.200]  but it reminds me of when I used to drink
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:06.800]  Jägermeister or tequila.
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:09.600]  It's more energetic.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:11.280]  It makes my head spin a little bit more.
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:13.080]  I don't relax well after dabs.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.240]  It makes me want to do shit,
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:16.840]  unless I take a half gram dab and want to sit down.
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:17.760]  Oh my goodness.
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.840]  Yeah, yeah, we won't do that tonight on the show.
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:21.600]  We will do a large dab.
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:22.800]  It's almost time.
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:26.240]  The large dab thing is almost coming to an end.
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.200]  I don't feel as good about it as I used to.
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:30.200]  I'm getting older, I guess.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:32.520]  Your lungs have so many inhales and exhales.
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:34.520]  And I'm assuming by doing a half gram dab,
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:38.360]  I'm probably using up multiple inhale and exhales
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:39.520]  for each dab.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:41.280]  And I'd like to live a little bit longer
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:42.960]  than I wanted to when I was a kid.
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.880]  I didn't realize one day I was going to fall over and die.
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:48.080]  So we may do a grand finale.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:51.120]  We may do like a gram dab or a two gram dab or something.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:52.200]  Episode 100.
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.040]  Episode, no, that's a long time.
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:55.880]  Maybe like 50 or something.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:57.000]  For the stars, brother.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:57.840]  For the stars.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:37:58.680]  I just want to do it.
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:00.840]  So that way we can retire the super large dab thing.
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:02.800]  We can put the dab challenges to a rest
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:04.120]  and say, hey, we're all alive.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.680]  And we could do the life challenge after that.
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:10.080]  So we're way off topic on this news thing.
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:11.000]  Weed's expensive.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.040]  It could be 200, 150 an ounce,
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:16.320]  but these shops are selling it for 500 an ounce close enough.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:17.160]  So.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:19.600]  You think weed is expensive where you live?
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:20.680]  Even though it's legal here,
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:23.000]  it's not the cheapest for recreational use.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.080]  Yeah, but it's available.
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:26.960]  Yeah, it's vastly available
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:28.560]  between the hours of eight and eight.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.640]  Here's a random question.
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:32.880]  You're from a state where cannabis was hard to get.
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:34.800]  You've told me stories about waiting on your dude
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:35.640]  for hours and hours.
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:37.120]  It's not that it was hard to get.
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:40.640]  It's just that everybody is too busy.
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.440]  There's other drugs that are more important
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:44.760]  than your $10 dime bag.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.080]  Okay, yeah, it's Florida.
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.840]  So you guys could imagine what kind of.
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.280]  Florida wasn't that hard.
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:50.320]  I grew up there.
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.360]  So it was, but when I moved back to Tennessee.
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:55.400]  So would you rather have, whoa,
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:57.400]  the internet just, it's refreshing multiple times
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:00.280]  and freaking me out, but it went right back to where it was.
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:01.520]  The music didn't cut out, so that's cool.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:02.760]  Would you rather have,
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.040]  so street weed is cheaper, a little bit cheaper.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:10.440]  I'm gonna say 30 bucks an eighth on the street.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:12.120]  How much is an eighth of weed at the dispensary
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:14.000]  where you would shop?
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.320]  For recreational?
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.000]  That you can go get, your med weed.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.560]  Oh, 30 at my shop.
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:21.400]  Would you rather.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:23.080]  We have deals every fourth and the 20th month.
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:24.920]  And how much is it rec?
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:26.080]  Recreational, sorry.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.160]  60 bucks an eighth.
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.160]  Holy crap, so.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:31.960]  55 to 60, just depending on which store.
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:35.320]  Would you rather have the convenience of going to the store
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:36.720]  and just paying the extra money,
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:39.320]  or would you rather sit there and wait for some high ass dude
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:41.160]  to show up with a sack that's probably light?
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:45.440]  If I go buy a gram or just a joint,
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:47.280]  from a pre-roll or something like that,
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.400]  we're gonna get high and it was eight bucks or 10 bucks.
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:51.240]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:52.600]  And I could go out there,
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:54.920]  it costs you a little bit of gas because it's here,
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:59.160]  it's outside of town, but some places have it closer.
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:00.000]  A little closer, yeah.
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:02.360]  If I lived out there, it'd be a different story,
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.480]  but you could go buy a joint.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:06.760]  It's as simple as that.
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:10.840]  And that to me, I'm not gonna go out there and do it
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:13.880]  just because you move here, you get kind of picky.
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:15.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:18.440]  Everybody in Colorado is a damn weed snob now,
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:19.320]  or all kind of sewers.
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:20.880]  I only smoke OG Kush.
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:22.520]  I was already a weed snob before I moved here.
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:24.320]  I only smoke Girl Scout cookies.
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:25.680]  People would give me weed and I'd be like,
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:27.520]  did you flush this?
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.480]  Do you even flush?
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:30.160]  Hashtag do you even flush, bro?
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.280]  Yeah, flush your weed.
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:34.480]  We'll talk about that in the future.
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:35.600]  Flush your weed, dude.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.440]  It's easy.
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.040]  It's one of the easiest, it's almost free.
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.400]  And it's one of the easiest things you can do.
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:41.360]  Just flush your weed.
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:42.640]  It'll help out so much.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:43.480]  And cure.
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:44.320]  And cure.
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.160]  Well, that's a whole,
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.360]  I can talk for hours about curing weed.
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:48.520]  Maybe I will one day.
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:50.200]  But those are the two things back East
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:51.440]  that people are like, what?
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:52.800]  That's what a lot of people are failing on.
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:54.120]  I see a lot of Facebook posts about,
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.440]  does anybody in Colorado know how to cure weed?
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:57.280]  Yes, I do.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:59.000]  And I'll share it.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:40:59.840]  I will.
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:00.680]  It's different here.
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:01.640]  What's dry here.
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:03.360]  So you need to build a humid room
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:04.400]  and control your humidity.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:05.480]  All right, I'm just ranting.
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:06.440]  I'm gonna get back to the article.
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:07.400]  Cause I said I had a lot of news.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:08.240]  And at this rate,
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:09.400]  we're not gonna get a lot of news.
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:10.240]  And news story.
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:11.080]  It's cool.
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:11.920]  It's a podcast, man.
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.360]  It's going the way it should.
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:14.520]  These out of state consumers,
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:15.960]  because remember we're talking about people
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:16.800]  from out of state.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:17.920]  That's how far it's been.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.280]  These out of state consumers are spending
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:20.280]  much more than locals.
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:21.120]  Grego said.
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:23.320]  They're spending about twice as much as locals,
[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:26.160]  about 120 to $140.
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.200]  Edibles are the most popular with these people.
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:30.360]  Out of state consumers can buy up to seven grams
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:31.200]  of cannabis total.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.880]  So you see them buy one to two grams of bud
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:37.840]  and the rest of their allotment made up of edible products.
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:39.440]  I'm not sure.
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:40.800]  I am not up to date with that rule.
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.960]  We're gonna have to look that up in the future here
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:44.160]  and talk about that.
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:45.640]  What is your edible?
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:47.360]  What, how much?
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:49.360]  Medical?
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:52.360]  They don't really distinguish between the two.
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:53.760]  No, I'm saying your edibles for,
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:55.480]  this is for recreational purposes.
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:56.640]  It's out of staters.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:58.600]  How much does my edible count as?
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:01.560]  I thought you and Kevin already went over this
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:05.560]  where it was gonna be weighed by the metric gram
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:06.560]  or whatever, you know?
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:07.640]  I mean.
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:08.480]  I don't remember that.
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:09.320]  We're gonna have to Google that.
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:10.200]  We'll find that out for you guys.
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.160]  Remind me to check that out
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:12.760]  and we'll put that on a future episode.
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:14.520]  Of course, I just saw fish this weekend
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:15.880]  after your, while you're listening to this.
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:17.240]  So I'm forgetful.
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:19.320]  I'm gonna need some pep talks.
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:20.160]  Remind me.
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:21.000]  Forgetful in the future.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:21.840]  Remind me.
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.680]  All right.
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:24.360]  Yeah, we're gonna get back to the future.
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:26.040]  Since it's illegal to cross state boundaries
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.320]  with legally purchased Colorado marijuana,
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.960]  does Griego and his staff inform these consumers,
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:34.480]  says customer, sorry, about that very serious state law?
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:36.760]  And here's where I have the problem.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:39.520]  This person that I got to try that cream
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:42.600]  was very vocal inside the store
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:45.480]  and asking where she could take Hearsaid products
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:50.240]  since it was high in CBD, just product in general.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:53.480]  And he, after informing him,
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:56.000]  after informing her three times,
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  he kind of got like, hey, can we stop saying anything
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.240]  about taking it where you're not supposed to?
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:04.320]  I think we've already said it.
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:05.880]  So guys, when you come to Colorado,
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:08.480]  what Adam's kind of alluding to is have some class,
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:10.280]  be careful what you say in the dispensaries.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.640]  No, the answer is no.
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:13.440]  When you're thinking, can I put this in my car
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:14.880]  and drive back to Texas?
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:15.720]  No.
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:17.960]  Can I put this in my suitcase and fly back to California?
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:20.480]  Maybe, maybe.
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:21.600]  You're not allowed to take it.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:23.520]  There's amnesty boxes in the airport.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:26.600]  Even there is ways to pack it.
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:28.720]  And if you're a medical marijuana patient in California
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:30.000]  and you're flying, figure that one out for yourself.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.520]  I'm not gonna encourage that, but you're not supposed to.
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:33.160]  I'm gonna leave all the medical states out of that.
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.840]  But the, no, you're not supposed to leave Colorado
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:37.720]  with Colorado marijuana products.
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:38.920]  You're really not supposed to do that.
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.160]  I shouldn't encourage it in any way.
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:41.400]  Even if you're going to California,
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:42.480]  if you're going to fucking Washington,
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:43.320]  it's legal. There is forms.
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:44.160]  Don't do it.
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:45.480]  And laws and procedures,
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:48.320]  because I've seen people, you know, for cups bring
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.040]  right, substantial amounts just in their, in their backpacks,
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:55.920]  you know, so there is forms and procedures go through that
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.480]  if you really want to do it,
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.600]  but you're not going to be like,
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:00.920]  can I bring my quarter home to Kentucky?
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:01.760]  No.
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:02.600]  So you shop at dispensaries.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:03.960]  This guy says when people come in,
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:05.800]  we're all about safety and state compliance.
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:08.640]  And we make sure that the out of state consumers are aware
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:12.200]  that they're, he says that,
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:14.120]  are aware that they're purchasing the,
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:16.680]  okay.
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:18.200]  I, this is written weird,
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  but it says there is for in-state consumption only.
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:23.520]  We also remind them that they can't do it in public.
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:25.400]  Is that true to the shops remind you that stuff
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:26.240]  when you're there?
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:27.560]  Cause you have an out of state ID.
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:31.120]  A few of them have not all of them.
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:34.200]  It just really depends on how busy, you know,
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  if they're having a slow day,
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:36.960]  they'll chat, chat you up a little bit,
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.800]  but if there's 10 people in the waiting room,
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:40.120]  they're not there.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:41.880]  They're not informing you of nothing there.
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:43.760]  What you, what you want.
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:44.800]  Okay.
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:45.680]  How much?
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.720]  Okay.
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:47.920]  You can buy this much.
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:50.320]  If you want to buy this much, that's what it really is.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:52.120]  Most of the recreational shops,
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:56.880]  the pre-rolls are actually just shake and bullshit
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:57.760]  and you don't want it.
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:01.560]  So I don't know if bullshit counts on the cuss jar.
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:02.480]  I just said bullshit.
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:03.840]  Does that count in the cuss jar?
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.680]  Is that fair?
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.520]  It's not the F word.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:07.040]  Hey, check out the can of sewer in this picture.
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:11.120]  They have, I'm not, I don't endorse any dispensary.
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:12.280]  Honestly, I'm not paid.
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:14.000]  I'm not sponsored by any dispensary.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.800]  I don't shop at most dispensaries.
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:18.080]  And I hate the picture.
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.120]  The picture of the can of sewer here
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:21.520]  has a picture of their,
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:24.520]  got a window cut out and you can see into their grow room.
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:27.120]  So if you are from another state
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:29.200]  and you want to see a pretty stylish looking grow room,
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:30.040]  check that out.
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.000]  I don't know anything about their product.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:32.840]  Many people here.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.200]  It looks cool in this picture.
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:35.600]  That is very stylish.
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:37.160]  I don't, like I said,
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:38.480]  I don't know what their product is like.
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:39.560]  If you go in there and they sell you,
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:41.240]  hey, I apologize.
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:42.080]  So,
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:47.320]  somebody looks like I may be right about that.
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:48.360]  You can say that on my show.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:49.840]  You're allowed to have an opinion, bro.
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:50.880]  No, no, no.
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:51.720]  I just-
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:52.880]  Out of five stars, how many?
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:53.920]  I've never been there.
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:54.760]  Okay.
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:56.120]  So I don't want to give any rating.
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:56.960]  All right.
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:45:57.800]  I've just heard stories.
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:45:58.640]  All right.
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:45:59.840]  Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories as well
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.320]  from about a lot of the shops here.
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:02.760]  I'm a med patient.
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:04.960]  80% of our customers are coming from out of state.
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.080]  So that's a good article there.
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:07.120]  I thought you guys would be interested.
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:09.320]  Let's click over back to the recording
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:11.600]  and see how many hours we've gone.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:12.520]  We're at 30 minutes here.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:15.720]  We're going to squeeze in some more stuff, you guys.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:18.000]  I sent an email to Jody Emery asking
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.560]  if I'm allowed to play parts of a Mark Emery video
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:21.600]  on a podcast.
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:22.440]  And if I am,
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:25.120]  I plan to play a little bit of Mark's speech
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.040]  that he gave recently after he was released
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:28.240]  from federal prison.
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:29.320]  So I look forward to doing that.
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:30.160]  I need a drink.
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:31.000]  Excuse me.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:31.840]  One second.
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:32.680]  Adam, say something.
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:34.200]  Yeah, I watched this and actually linked it to him.
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:37.160]  It was a powerful, motivating speech.
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:39.640]  He is on the ball.
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:44.200]  And if he does get the permission to do it,
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:45.120]  I won't ruin it for you,
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:47.480]  but everybody should watch it.
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:49.600]  And if it doesn't inspire you to get up on your feet-
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:51.920]  You want to take a risk and just play some of it?
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:54.640]  We can, or we can just talk kind of what it's about.
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.520]  I don't really want to talk what it's about.
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:46:58.720]  I like being innovative.
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:01.840]  The audio, I don't think we'll be in trouble for it.
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:02.680]  I really don't.
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:03.520]  As long as we don't play a video or something.
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:04.360]  It's on YouTube.
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:05.200]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:07.720]  Let's click over here and pause the music.
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:08.560]  And then I think I'm going to play
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:09.560]  a little bit of this video.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:10.600]  I wasn't prepared to do it,
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:12.360]  but we're talking about it.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.440]  And it seems like the thing to do.
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:16.200]  If you kind of play towards the end of it,
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:18.360]  it would kind of relay the message more of it,
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:20.480]  unless you want to play the whole video later on.
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:22.600]  How about I'll play a couple of intro seconds
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:23.800]  when he takes the mic.
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.080]  He was introduced at one point
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:27.520]  and he brought his friend back on stage to-
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:28.680]  That's a good part to play.
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:29.640]  He gets introduced.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:32.000]  Mark Emery is introduced by somebody else.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.520]  Mark Emery comes on stage and gives thanks to another friend
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:35.560]  and hands the mic to him.
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:38.520]  That guy talks for about eight minutes.
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:40.440]  And then Mark Emery comes back on stage
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:43.320]  and starts his little, not little, his big speech.
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:45.080]  We'll start with, it's about 10 minutes
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:47.120]  and 25 seconds into the video.
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:48.040]  We'll start there.
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.880]  I'm going to give a shout out to the YouTube pages
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:50.720]  that I'm playing it from.
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:51.600]  I'm trying to be polite here.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:53.600]  These guys are, I asked for permission.
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:55.720]  I haven't gotten the email back saying yes or no yet,
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:57.280]  but they're busy.
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:47:58.280]  I feel like they'd let me do it.
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:47:59.200]  And it's Jodi Emery.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.040]  She's cool.
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:00.880]  Why wouldn't she want Mark's-
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.720]  Preach the word.
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:04.440]  Yeah, and it's coming from Pot TV on YouTube.
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:07.520]  It's on Cannabis Culture's website.
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:08.640]  Big shout out to all those guys.
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:09.960]  So please-
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.320]  I subscribe to you.
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:13.520]  I beg for your forgiveness if I wasn't supposed to do this,
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:16.160]  but I'm sure you'd want this message out.
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:17.520]  And then we'll play a few seconds of it.
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.920]  And then we'll find out if we can play a lot of it.
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:21.880]  And if we can play a bunch, we'll go ahead and play
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:24.160]  a couple of minutes of it for everyone.
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:25.160]  Yeah.
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:26.040]  Guys, I'm going to take a drink.
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:26.880]  We'll take some dabs.
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:29.480]  I'll start off this Mark Emery video.
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:30.960]  This was kind of a weird transition here
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:31.880]  that randomly happened.
[02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:33.720]  This is Mark Emery right after he,
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:36.360]  I think he's like 48 hours out of prison when he did this.
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:37.200]  Absolutely.
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.480]  Right, like 48, something like that, he said.
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.560]  So here it goes.
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:42.480]  I'm going to click play and I will have to adjust
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:43.320]  the sound while it goes on.
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:44.160]  I apologize.
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:45.000]  We'll figure it out on the fly.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  It's fun to be me.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:46.840]  It's Mark Emery.
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:49.040]  And I even said that while I was in prison
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.040]  because doing something, let's almost use the word noble,
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:55.040]  doing something on principle,
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  giving a good chunk of your life in sacrifice,
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:02.240]  I guess, for principle, even in prison was highly regarded.
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:04.600]  In the four and a half years I was in prison,
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:07.080]  I really never heard an unkind word spoken to me
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:08.200]  by any inmate.
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:10.840]  And I was in a medium security prison for almost all that.
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:13.240]  And a lot of these people are serving life imprisonment
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:14.160]  without parole.
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:16.000]  They've come down from the penitentiary.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.560]  They're covered in tattoos.
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:20.120]  They're bad-ass dudes, a lot of them,
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.880]  or at least they think they are.
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:24.480]  And they're serving horribly long sentences,
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:26.560]  by and large, for drugs,
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.720]  mostly methamphetamine, crack, cocaine,
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:30.600]  but certainly there were many, many people there
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:32.560]  for marijuana serving 10, 15,
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:37.120]  and even in one case, 25 years for marijuana distribution.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:41.280]  So I was able to be very productive in jail.
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:42.280]  I wrote a lot.
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:43.440]  I blogged.
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:44.920]  I read a book every week.
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:47.000]  I had 25 magazine subscriptions.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.120]  I got the New York Times every day.
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.840]  I learned how to play the bass guitar
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:54.200]  and was in an outstanding rock and roll band
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:56.400]  of incredibly talented musicians.
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:59.600]  And all of them were very patient in teaching me
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.920]  at no charge for anything, music and music principles
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:05.880]  and how to be a bass guitarist.
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:08.880]  And I must tell you that it was a very redemptive
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:11.360]  and meaningful experience being in prison.
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:14.160]  And I hope I always carry the message forward
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:16.520]  that I saw there that, you know,
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:19.800]  it is a very wrong society that punishes people for drugs
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:21.840]  and puts them in jail for decades
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:24.080]  and takes them away from their family and their children
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.360]  and essentially ruins their life
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:28.680]  because of a lifestyle choice they made.
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:30.240]  And we manufacture crime.
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:31.440]  With the drug laws, we actually-
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.680]  All right, guys, Mark Emery can talk for quite a while.
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:35.600]  I'm gonna kind of fade out.
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.680]  Adam's telling me that I should play this stuff
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:38.520]  at the end of the video
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.720]  because it's a lot more moving and compelling.
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:41.560]  I'm gonna save that.
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:42.480]  I'm gonna tease it a little bit.
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:44.240]  I'm gonna make sure that I can get permission.
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:46.280]  That was about a minute and a half there.
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:48.280]  I hope I don't get in any kind of trouble.
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:50.280]  If they take down this episode, I apologize.
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:52.880]  All it was was some news and a Mark Emery rant anyway.
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:54.680]  You're right, I didn't get a backup.
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:55.600]  But anyway- Yeah, I'll just cut that out
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:56.440]  and we'll fix it.
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:57.280]  That's right.
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:58.360]  Good idea. Go watch the video.
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:02.000]  The message after he gets through this,
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.600]  what I did in jail stuff, you know?
[02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:06.160]  And I mean, that's moving, trust me.
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:08.120]  But his message towards the end
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:10.240]  is definitely what you need to hear.
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:11.880]  And it's what we need to do.
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:16.360]  So take the video, take 30 minutes and watch it.
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:17.320]  Yeah, if they let me-
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:18.920]  Whoa, that was loud, I apologize.
[02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:19.760]  If they let me play that,
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:22.240]  I'll play the last few minutes at the end of this show here.
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:24.200]  I'm gonna wait for the email, try to be respectful.
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:27.200]  And if I don't get the email by the time I post the episode,
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.880]  then I won't do it, I'm sorry.
[02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:34.880]  So in Denver, part of this article,
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:36.240]  I'm gonna kind of paraphrase it
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.080]  because it's a lot of stuff.
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:38.120]  And the episode's getting long already.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:40.960]  I got a couple more things I wanna read about.
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:42.560]  This is from the Cannabis also.
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:44.600]  This was actually published August 12th.
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:48.240]  It's by Alida Laback from the Cannabis staff.
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:50.680]  I didn't say that right, I'm sure, but I'm sorry.
[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:56.320]  This one is, so Governor Hickenlooper,
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:01.720]  John Hickenlooper placed these giant cages
[02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:03.480]  around places in Denver.
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:05.840]  He put one in front of a skate park.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:08.000]  He put one in front of a library in Denver,
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:09.440]  the Denver Public Library.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:13.120]  And they're big cages that look like your hamster cage
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:15.120]  and they call it a lab rat cage.
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:18.120]  It's a lab rat cage that says, don't be a lab rat.
[02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:22.120]  And it's on the inside, it's got a little thing
[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:23.640]  that tells you about cannabis
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:26.080]  and the problems that cannabis can cause you.
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:28.680]  And it's saying, don't be a lab rat to cannabis
[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:31.240]  to encourage kids to not smoke weed.
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:37.400]  Well, if you put a big 12 foot tall lab rat looking cage
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:40.680]  with a giant, looks like those water bottles
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:43.240]  that hang upside down that your hamster licks to get water.
[02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:45.200]  And then it's got a little green thing on the outside
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:48.240]  that talks about cannabis on it, a little note.
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:49.640]  If you wanna come around on the side of the computer, bro,
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:51.240]  and take a look, it's definitely worth looking at.
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:52.080]  It's funny.
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:54.240]  Am I right?
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:56.080]  It's just like a people cage for hamsters
[02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:57.440]  or a hamster cage for peoples.
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:52:58.480]  It is a people cage.
[02:52:58.480 --> 02:52:59.800]  It is a people cage.
[02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:02.880]  And so the article says, well, that didn't take long.
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:04.240]  The state of Colorado debuted
[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:06.240]  its don't be a lab rat youth campaign
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:07.480]  on Monday, August 11th,
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:10.160]  by dropping human size laboratory cages
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:11.200]  around the Denver area,
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:13.280]  including outside the Denver Public Library
[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:15.000]  and the downtown skate park.
[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:19.720]  Vandalized signs at the skate park installation
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:22.760]  were reported Monday evening by CBS4.
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:24.040]  The cages feature posters
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:26.320]  that cite controversial marijuana research studies
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:29.520]  and ask open-ended questions about pot use,
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:30.800]  about youth pot use.
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:32.480]  Sorry, that was a hard sentence.
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:34.600]  Some cleverly crossed out a reference
[02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:38.040]  to negative effects of marijuana and changed it to positive.
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:41.080]  Although another message left on the poster says,
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:43.800]  critically, smoking weed saved my life.
[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:47.560]  The campaign, which targets teens with messages
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:49.520]  that marijuana research is ongoing,
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:54.120]  particularly in studies of the developing brain,
[02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:56.560]  is trying a different tact
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.040]  from the just say no anti-drug campaigns of yore.
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:01.680]  There are a few variations of the posters
[02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:03.320]  that adorn the giant cages.
[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:06.640]  So a new message is sure to replace the vandalized signs.
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:09.800]  The vandalism was taken in stride by Dr. Larry Wolk,
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:11.760]  who leads the state health department.
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:13.440]  If they're defacing it,
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:15.600]  or they're doing something with regard to graffiti
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:16.840]  or gathering in the cages,
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:18.760]  at least they're taking notice
[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:21.000]  and let the debate occur.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  They're probably just breaking that shit
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.040]  while they're smoking a joint.
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:27.160]  To be perfectly honest.
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:30.080]  There was also the man who toked up inside the cage
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.960]  at the skate park, according to the TV station report.
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:34.120]  So somebody was-
[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:35.200]  That's what I think it is.
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:36.440]  It's just marijuana activists.
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:37.280]  I mean, it's Denver.
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:39.960]  You know, it's not like there's not enough of them.
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:42.320]  You know, obviously people got off their ass
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:45.720]  and signed enough papers that it's legal here, you know?
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:48.040]  The $2 million project,
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:51.000]  which includes a stylized website
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:55.440]  is funded by a grant paid by legal settlements
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:57.200]  with various pharmaceutical companies,
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:59.280]  according to the governor's office.
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.120]  Another component of the don't be a lab rat campaign
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.160]  are the TV ads as seen below.
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:06.320]  We're not gonna watch these stupid ass commercials.
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:08.240]  Where does Big Pharma get off
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:10.200]  by telling you not to be a lab rat?
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:12.680]  Well, they need your money.
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:16.000]  I get that they want you on Zoloft instead of weed, but-
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:17.680]  Dude.
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:18.520]  Yep.
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.920]  Well, most of our listeners
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:24.560]  probably haven't seen these gigantic lab rat cages.
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:25.760]  It's quite entertaining.
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:27.880]  They've posted, there are three or four stories
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:29.160]  on the cannabis about it.
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:30.440]  We were down there the other day.
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:31.640]  I would have liked to go get a picture.
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:32.720]  You know, that's a good idea.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:34.880]  We should have gone and checked it out.
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:36.280]  If you want to jump around on this side again
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.800]  and take a look, there's actually people inside of this one
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.320]  as they were building it.
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.240]  Here, I'll move the email out of the way.
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:45.040]  That's the people cage they're working with right there.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.240]  It's essentially a lion cage from the zoo.
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:50.080]  Yeah.
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:50.920]  It's a lion.
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:51.760]  It looks like a lion cage.
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:55.680]  It looks like a large cat, small enclosure.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:57.600]  Is that 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 by 10?
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:58.440]  Yeah.
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:55:59.280]  By 10?
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:00.120]  I don't even think it's that.
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:00.960]  It's probably 12 by 10.
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:01.800]  Okay.
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:02.640]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:03.680]  It's probably longer than it is wider.
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:05.480]  But yeah.
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:08.520]  And there's a lot of scrutiny
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:11.560]  about how kind of ridiculous it is too
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:14.360]  from a lot of people by the looks of these websites.
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:15.880]  So let me click and see how long we're going.
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:17.800]  It's bigger than a jail cell.
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:22.520]  I'm just going to keep moving on with that one.
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:24.920]  We are about 40 minutes in, so we can keep going.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.600]  We got a couple, we can make this a perfect hour.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:28.120]  I bet if we do this, right?
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:28.960]  All right.
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:29.800]  All right.
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:30.640]  I'll try to save a couple of minutes
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.240]  for the Mark Emery part if we get a chance to do that.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:37.240]  So this is something random and this only support,
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:40.440]  I'm reading this because this supports the legalization,
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:42.280]  the nationwide legalization
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:44.520]  and decriminalization of cannabis.
[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:46.360]  The headline will say it all for you.
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:50.280]  New Hampshire declares state of emergency over spice.
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:51.120]  No shit, right?
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:52.160]  You know how to cure that?
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:53.840]  Let us just smoke the weed we want to smoke
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:56.240]  instead of having to smoke fake spice.
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:00.600]  A lot of that is probation and jobs.
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:02.640]  Probation and prohibition and job testing.
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:03.520]  Yep.
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:07.240]  I mean, I had personal experience with this
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:10.560]  where people were like, oh no, it's better than sex, man.
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:12.880]  You gotta, I've never.
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:14.840]  And I was like, all right, whatever.
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:16.040]  And dude, I will never again.
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:17.800]  I was in the toilet for six hours,
[02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:20.680]  like hacking my lungs up, felt like a piece of shit.
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:21.520]  Yum.
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.440]  And don't ever smoke spice.
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.280]  Yeah.
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:26.080]  The guys that listen to my show won't smoke spice.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:26.920]  Yeah, I know.
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:29.520]  And Adam will try anything twice.
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:30.800]  He only did spice once.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:31.640]  Yep.
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:33.400]  All right.
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:34.240]  So I'm gonna read some of that.
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:35.080]  It doesn't even seem like we need this.
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:35.920]  Gets the point across, right?
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:36.760]  Yeah, don't.
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:37.600]  Fucking legalize.
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:38.920]  I said, I just said, fuck, somebody tweet me
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:40.120]  and tell me to quit doing it.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:41.000]  I'm sorry, guys.
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:41.840]  I know it's offensive.
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:42.680]  It's a terrible word.
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:44.320]  I gotta quit doing that.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:46.080]  So it's kind of obvious.
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:49.200]  Legalize cannabis and we won't have to smoke.
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.000]  They won't have to smoke spice.
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:54.880]  Employers and probation.
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:56.280]  Some probation, you can't drink alcohol,
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:59.440]  but employers don't care if you go out at five o'clock
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:02.520]  or six o'clock, or if you go down to panic hour at 6.15
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:05.600]  and drink 22 beers, your employer doesn't care.
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:07.720]  But if you smoke a fat joint, man,
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:10.080]  you might get fired from your job, which is terrible.
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:11.200]  I'll read part of this.
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:14.760]  Governor Maggie Hassan has declared a state of emergency
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:16.720]  to allow public health officials to investigate
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:20.040]  and quarantine synthetic drugs linked to recent overdoses
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:22.120]  in Manchester and Concord.
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:23.760]  This is New Hampshire, by the way.
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:27.160]  Authorities say at least 41 people in the Manchester area
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:29.440]  have experienced serious medical reactions
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:32.480]  to synthetic cannabinoids known as spice
[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:34.480]  that are chemically engineered substances
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:37.160]  similar to the active ingredient in marijuana.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:41.280]  Let's scrutinize this sentence just for fun.
[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:44.800]  Synthetic cannabinoids.
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:46.800]  I don't think that that's what that is.
[02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:53.600]  It's poser pot known as spice that are chemically engineered
[02:58:53.640 --> 02:58:55.560]  chemically engineered substances.
[02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:56.800]  That's close, I think.
[02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:58.440]  Active ingredient in marijuana.
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:00.280]  Marijuana doesn't have ingredients.
[02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:01.280]  It's a compound, I think,
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:02.840]  is what you'd want to call it there.
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:06.600]  So come on, guys, you're the cannabis bra.
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:08.000]  Cannabis properly.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:09.480]  Do you even cannabis, bro?
[02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:12.480]  Concord police have reported
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:15.440]  at least three cases since Wednesday.
[02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:19.360]  Hassan's declaration gives the State Department
[02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:20.960]  of Health and Human Services
[02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:22.720]  the power to investigate, quarantine,
[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:25.280]  and require the destruction of the products.
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:27.680]  She says the department will work with the police
[02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:29.320]  to quarantine the bubblegum flavor
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:31.560]  of a product named Smacked.
[02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:33.640]  Such products are labeled as herbal incense
[02:59:33.640 --> 02:59:36.080]  but are known to be smoked or brewed.
[02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:38.680]  Who wants to take a product called Smacked?
[02:59:39.640 --> 02:59:42.880]  I don't know, I might take a dab of a strain called Smacked.
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:45.440]  Yeah, but not a spice.
[02:59:45.440 --> 02:59:48.200]  I mean, people have been doing this for years
[02:59:48.200 --> 02:59:52.080]  but they put them in boilers and use them in rooms,
[02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:55.320]  you know, like large rooms to give everybody
[02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:56.160]  that kind of feeling.
[02:59:56.160 --> 02:59:57.880]  Oh my gosh.
[02:59:57.880 --> 02:59:59.880]  Frankincense myrrh has been used for that.
[02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:01.680]  I'm just imagining what if.
[03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:02.880]  They just, for years.
[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:04.720]  Everybody got spiced up.
[03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.600]  And like, yeah, let's get baked.
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:09.280]  No, they had herb for that
[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:12.160]  because it wasn't against the law then, you know?
[03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:15.120]  It wasn't all around the world.
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:17.000]  It's still looked at as something crazy
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:21.320]  and people are gonna try to get it one way or the other.
[03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:24.400]  Well, here's some decently uplifting news.
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.400]  Utah Medical Marijuana Program,
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:30.320]  11 cards issued, several for child patients.
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:34.160]  This is by Michelle L. Price of the Associated Press.
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:35.960]  In Salt Lake City,
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:38.400]  Utah issued nearly a dozen registration cards
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:41.160]  in the first month of its limited medical marijuana program
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:43.120]  that allows those with severe epilepsy
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:45.960]  to possess cannabis extract oil.
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:49.040]  This was August 9th, so this is kind of old news,
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.400]  but I just wanted to put out some news and catch up.
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:53.960]  As of Friday evening, the state has issued 11 cards
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:55.560]  since the program started July 8th,
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:58.080]  said Janice Houston, the state registrar
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:59.920]  and director of the Utah Department
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:01.720]  of Health Records Office.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:03.720]  About half of those 11 cards were issued
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:05.840]  for child patients, Houston said.
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:09.120]  An application for another card is pending.
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:11.320]  Health department officials on Friday also announced
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:15.640]  the $400 annual fee for the cards had been cut in half.
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:18.440]  The program's startup fee were less than expected
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:22.040]  and the registration cards will now cost $200, Houston said.
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:26.080]  Dude, there are 11 cards and one more being applied for
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:27.320]  in the state of Utah.
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:29.720]  I was at a party the other night
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:32.360]  and there were probably 11 medical marijuana cards
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:33.200]  in the room.
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:36.320]  No, it's a huge relief, said Jennifer May
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:38.040]  with Hope for Children with Epilepsy.
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:40.280]  We've been trying to find ways to help the families
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:41.640]  come up with that money
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:44.120]  along with the money for the oil itself.
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:45.840]  Those who already paid the higher fee
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:48.040]  will be refunded, health officials said.
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:50.400]  Utah's law doesn't allow the distribution
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:51.280]  of medical marijuana,
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:53.160]  but it permits those meeting certain requirements
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:57.000]  to possess the extract after getting it from other states.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:01.040]  So they can at least get what they need to from Colorado.
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:02.200]  Wow, yeah.
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.280]  Hey, that's a step in the right direction, honestly.
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:09.720]  The extract, this is, I'm frustrated.
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:10.560]  They fuck up right here.
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:13.000]  The extract called cannabidiol.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Okay, man, they're looking for that CBD,
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.560]  but that's not the extract.
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:20.480]  Come on, cannabis, please.
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:22.320]  The extract called cannabidiol
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:24.160]  is believed to help with severe seizures,
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:26.600]  particularly those experienced by children
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:28.800]  with a severe form of epilepsy.
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:30.920]  Um...
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:32.600]  Georgia is also looking at that too.
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:34.240]  Close, guys, nice try.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:36.520]  It's not an extract called cannabidiol.
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.880]  Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid,
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:42.400]  but one of the cannabinoids in the extract,
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:44.040]  but I see what you're doing.
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:44.880]  Nice try, guys.
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:45.720]  You got it.
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:48.520]  That, you fucked me up a couple of times in this article.
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:51.240]  So the oil doesn't have the psychoactive properties
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:52.240]  that gets users high
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:55.200]  and can be mixed with foods such as applesauce.
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:57.520]  Um...
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:00.280]  I wonder if they'd be able to bring back the OG caps
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:03.040]  because those OG caps from essential extracts
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:05.040]  available at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers,
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:06.240]  which is a medical shop.
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:07.600]  Man.
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:09.680]  So they're gonna have to get a Colorado residency
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:11.400]  and get a medical marijuana card in Colorado
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:14.880]  to even acquire this type of medicine to get it to Utah.
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:15.840]  Maybe not in Dipper.
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:18.440]  You know, maybe there's something a little more...
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:19.920]  Yeah, hopefully.
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:20.760]  Nowadays.
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:21.960]  All right, we'll keep going.
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:23.520]  The cost of cannabidiol varies
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:24.800]  depending on the size of the patient
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:27.040]  and the level of the dose the patient is receiving.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:28.000]  For a hundred pound person,
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.120]  a month's supply of a beginning dose is about 40 bucks.
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:32.760]  A maximum dose for the same patient
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:35.200]  could cost up to $900 a month.
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:40.160]  What they are talking about seems to be Phoenix Tears,
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:43.680]  Rick Simpson oil, full plant cannabis extract,
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:45.600]  full extract cannabis oil.
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:48.200]  It's Orally Eaton.
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:50.920]  It's black usually or greenish colored.
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:52.800]  They're not talking about dabs or anything.
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:54.480]  So it's basically Rick Simpson oil.
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:56.120]  If you guys are familiar with that,
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:03:58.560]  there's a movie called Run From The Cure,
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:03:59.720]  I believe is what it's called.
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:00.760]  Race for the Cure.
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:02.280]  It's Run From The Cure, the Rick Simpson story.
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:05.080]  Search for the name Rick Simpson and then put cannabis oil
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:06.320]  and you'll find the movie I'm talking about.
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:07.880]  Learn about Rick Simpson oil.
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:10.840]  A lot of people say Rick Simpson may have stolen that recipe
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:11.920]  and gotten famous off of it.
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:12.760]  I don't care.
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:14.000]  He's helping a lot of people do your thing.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:15.800]  Shout out Rick Simpson.
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:16.640]  Give thanks.
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:17.480]  There we go.
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:18.920]  We just did a give thanks section on accident.
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:20.720]  The main producer of the extract in Colorado
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:22.640]  has a waiting list with thousands of names
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:25.320]  and doesn't expect to have more supply until fall.
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:26.760]  And other producers of the product
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:29.800]  have also have a waiting list, May said.
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:32.480]  Because Utah's registration cards expire year after year,
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:36.240]  many families are expected to apply later this year.
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:38.360]  About 100 families are expected to take advantage
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:41.320]  of Utah's program, health department officials said.
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:42.880]  May, whose 12 year old son
[03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:45.160]  can suffer hundreds of seizures a day,
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:47.400]  said she and many other families are also waiting
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:48.920]  to see if they can secure a spot
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:51.320]  in a pending drug trial by neurologists
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:54.320]  at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City.
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:56.480]  Once families receive a registration card,
[03:04:56.480 --> 03:04:59.160]  they can face additional hurdles
[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:01.200]  to actually get the extract from other states,
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:02.800]  including enrolling in that state's
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:04.480]  medical marijuana program.
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:07.040]  All state marijuana programs, medical or otherwise,
[03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:08.840]  are still illegal under federal law.
[03:05:08.840 --> 03:05:11.360]  And some doctors and advocacy groups have warned
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:14.080]  there's no proof the extract is effective
[03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:15.600]  at treating epilepsy.
[03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:17.920]  But families say it's worth the time and cost
[03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:21.360]  if it brings relief to those suffering from seizures.
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:25.520]  All right, do you think these people are gonna pay $400
[03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:28.120]  or now $200 to get the medical marijuana card
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:32.280]  that they require and then go spend money in another state?
[03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:35.600]  They're gonna travel to Colorado to get this oil
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:40.600]  that costs up to $900 for a freaking dose, a month dose.
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:42.640]  They're gonna drive from Colorado to Utah.
[03:05:42.640 --> 03:05:44.480]  They're gonna spend a couple of hundred bucks in gas.
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:45.980]  They're gonna spend a day away.
[03:05:45.980 --> 03:05:49.420]  They're probably traveling with a child with seizures.
[03:05:49.420 --> 03:05:51.580]  Are they gonna waste, and excuse this one,
[03:05:51.580 --> 03:05:53.140]  are they gonna waste that fucking time
[03:05:53.140 --> 03:05:55.180]  if this medicine doesn't work?
[03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:58.860]  If they're just, no, there must be something working, right?
[03:05:58.860 --> 03:06:01.220]  There's that documentary that I linked you
[03:06:01.220 --> 03:06:03.540]  not that long ago that literally you watch
[03:06:03.540 --> 03:06:04.940]  these people uproot their life.
[03:06:04.940 --> 03:06:06.260]  They come out here and they try it.
[03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:07.620]  I'm pretty sure I've seen that one, yeah.
[03:06:07.620 --> 03:06:09.180]  Then they go back to their home state
[03:06:09.180 --> 03:06:12.020]  and their home state's giving them a 0.0
[03:06:12.020 --> 03:06:15.540]  or 0.something CBD value.
[03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:17.900]  They had to uproot their lives and move to Colorado.
[03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:20.780]  I mean, there's a million stories like it all over.
[03:06:20.780 --> 03:06:23.900]  You throw a stone here and you can pretty much find
[03:06:23.900 --> 03:06:27.220]  what they're calling the marijuana refugees.
[03:06:28.340 --> 03:06:32.580]  So it's hard, man, absolutely.
[03:06:32.580 --> 03:06:34.500]  This dude, the story you just read said
[03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:37.460]  half the people we get are coming from out of state.
[03:06:37.460 --> 03:06:38.780]  I think you said 70.
[03:06:38.780 --> 03:06:41.580]  Why would people not come here to help their children
[03:06:41.580 --> 03:06:45.260]  that is in desperate need of oil themselves?
[03:06:45.980 --> 03:06:47.780]  People are packing up their entire lives
[03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:50.340]  and moving to another state because we can offer them
[03:06:50.340 --> 03:06:51.940]  a medicine that is obviously working.
[03:06:51.940 --> 03:06:52.780]  And there's plenty of video documentary out there.
[03:06:52.780 --> 03:06:54.820]  And I'm not gonna say it's gonna work for everybody.
[03:06:54.820 --> 03:06:56.980]  Yeah, the union was the first time I ever saw that.
[03:06:56.980 --> 03:06:59.340]  There's a guy that he's all shaky
[03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:00.700]  and I don't mean to be rude about it.
[03:07:00.700 --> 03:07:01.940]  He's really shaky and they-
[03:07:01.940 --> 03:07:03.820]  Smoked and it was gone.
[03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:06.660]  Yep, he goes right back to not shaky.
[03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:08.900]  So while we got time for one more quick news article,
[03:07:08.900 --> 03:07:13.900]  Seattle Pot Tickets, one cop wrote 80% of citations.
[03:07:14.780 --> 03:07:17.660]  What were they calling that one guy out there in California
[03:07:17.660 --> 03:07:19.020]  when it really boomed?
[03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:21.420]  There was one dude out there.
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:23.700]  You know who I'm talking to that was just standing outside
[03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:26.220]  of pot shops, like writing people citations.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:28.260]  Yeah, I don't remember his name, but yeah.
[03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:30.100]  So this is from Seattle.
[03:07:30.100 --> 03:07:32.820]  A Seattle police officer has been reassigned after review.
[03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:35.500]  After a review found, he wrote about 80%
[03:07:35.500 --> 03:07:37.460]  of marijuana tickets issued in the city
[03:07:37.460 --> 03:07:40.060]  during the first half of 2014.
[03:07:41.020 --> 03:07:43.940]  Seattle police chief Kathleen O'Toole said 30,
[03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:46.460]  or said July 30 on the department website
[03:07:46.460 --> 03:07:49.740]  that the unidentified officer issued 66
[03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:53.540]  of the 83 citations for public pot use in Seattle.
[03:07:53.540 --> 03:07:56.100]  She says that in some cases he added notes to the tickets
[03:07:56.100 --> 03:07:58.940]  or addressed them to Seattle city attorney, Pete Holmes.
[03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:04.180]  In other case, the officer reportedly said he flipped a coin
[03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:06.340]  when deciding which person to cite.
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:08.300]  O'Toole says the officer also wrote
[03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:10.260]  on the voter approved state initiative
[03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:14.140]  legalizing recreational marijuana was silly.
[03:08:14.140 --> 03:08:17.260]  The police chief said that the case has been referred
[03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:19.860]  to the department's official of professional accountability.
[03:08:19.860 --> 03:08:22.460]  She says the officer won't be on patrol duties
[03:08:22.460 --> 03:08:23.980]  during the investigation.
[03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:27.860]  Big middle finger to that cop.
[03:08:28.940 --> 03:08:30.700]  That's all I got to say about that one.
[03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:32.100]  Just hating.
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:35.100]  Yeah, let some people smoke some weed, man.
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:35.940]  You don't know their story.
[03:08:35.940 --> 03:08:38.020]  Maybe they had something crazy.
[03:08:38.700 --> 03:08:39.540]  Right?
[03:08:39.540 --> 03:08:41.060]  Maybe weed killed their dad or something.
[03:08:41.060 --> 03:08:44.940]  I guess if that had ever happened, you know, I don't know.
[03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:45.780]  I'm just saying.
[03:08:45.780 --> 03:08:46.620]  We'd never killed anybody.
[03:08:46.620 --> 03:08:47.460]  Don't say that.
[03:08:47.460 --> 03:08:48.300]  I understand that, but I'm just saying.
[03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:50.620]  The only way that you can be killed by marijuana,
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:52.220]  the only way you can be killed by cannabis
[03:08:52.220 --> 03:08:54.980]  is if a bunch of it falls on top of you
[03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:56.860]  or if a cop beats you up for having it in your pocket.
[03:08:56.860 --> 03:08:57.700]  You see that's what I'm saying.
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:08:59.500]  Maybe her dad got crushed by thousands of pounds.
[03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:00.540]  Crushed by tons of weed?
[03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:02.060]  Yeah.
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:03.820]  Imagine that stanky death.
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:06.340]  Who's got a lighter with Dalby you're thinking about?
[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:07.980]  Just burn this on top of me.
[03:09:08.940 --> 03:09:09.780]  Nothing horrible.
[03:09:09.780 --> 03:09:11.340]  I'm not saying like he smoked a joint and died.
[03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:13.020]  You know, I'm saying that.
[03:09:13.020 --> 03:09:15.260]  I'm just gonna wrap that part of this talk up.
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:18.580]  All right, guys, we have gone.
[03:09:18.580 --> 03:09:20.340]  We're pretty close to an hour now.
[03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:23.220]  So I'm not sure if they are going to let me play
[03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:25.020]  more of that Mark Emery video.
[03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:27.140]  If they do, it'll happen here.
[03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:31.860]  I mean, if you'd have told me,
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:35.860]  Mark, you're gonna spend the next 25 years, you know,
[03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:38.380]  smoking joints and bongs and selling seeds
[03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:39.220]  and you're gonna go to jail
[03:09:39.220 --> 03:09:41.980]  for many, many years of your life.
[03:09:41.980 --> 03:09:45.540]  But one day after 25 years of you being arrested,
[03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.100]  of you going to jail, of you being taken away,
[03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:48.620]  of you losing all your assets,
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:51.340]  of you being separated from your family and your wife,
[03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:55.100]  after all that, you're gonna have one day,
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:10:00.100]  one day in 2015, and if you can get your people together,
[03:10:00.500 --> 03:10:03.020]  it all ends on that day.
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:07.180]  On that day, the next day after that day,
[03:10:07.180 --> 03:10:09.380]  the stores will start selling marijuana.
[03:10:09.380 --> 03:10:11.300]  People will walk the streets confident
[03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:12.460]  about the marijuana in their pocket.
[03:10:12.460 --> 03:10:13.860]  They're not gonna get arrested.
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:16.620]  There will be medical marijuana science experiments
[03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:19.180]  and advancements every day after that,
[03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:22.660]  because it'll be legal to study marijuana in universities.
[03:10:22.660 --> 03:10:25.300]  It'll be legal for doctors to recommend it.
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:28.540]  It'll be legal for doctors, judges, cops,
[03:10:28.540 --> 03:10:32.660]  politicians to smoke it and share it and understand it.
[03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:34.500]  It'll be legal to go and buy it.
[03:10:34.500 --> 03:10:36.420]  It'll be legal for ordinary people to grow it.
[03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:38.060]  It'll be legal for people to have a business
[03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:39.260]  that grows marijuana.
[03:10:39.260 --> 03:10:42.300]  It'll be legal for everybody to make vaporizers and bongs.
[03:10:42.300 --> 03:10:44.300]  All the books and magazines about marijuana
[03:10:44.300 --> 03:10:45.300]  will all be legal.
[03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:47.820]  No one will ever try and ban them ever again.
[03:10:47.820 --> 03:10:50.380]  No one will ever say a bad thing about pot smokers
[03:10:50.380 --> 03:10:52.660]  as a culture, as a way of demonizing them
[03:10:52.660 --> 03:10:57.660]  and sending them to jail, because Mark, in 25 years,
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:11:02.380]  that one day, everybody showed up,
[03:11:03.060 --> 03:11:04.940]  and it was a happy, wonderful world ever since,
[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:06.940]  because everybody showed up.
[03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:08.660]  So that's my message.
[03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:10.940]  We've got a big opportunity coming in 14 months.
[03:11:10.940 --> 03:11:13.220]  I'm gonna be touring the country relentlessly,
[03:11:13.220 --> 03:11:15.860]  telling everybody, even in other countries,
[03:11:15.860 --> 03:11:19.380]  you just need one day where everybody we know
[03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:21.220]  who smokes pot shows up.
[03:11:21.220 --> 03:11:22.740]  That'll be my message in Ireland.
[03:11:22.740 --> 03:11:24.020]  It'll be my message in Spain.
[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:25.620]  It'll be my message in Vienna.
[03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:27.340]  It's gonna be my message all across Canada,
[03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:29.980]  and it's certainly my message to all Americans
[03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:33.340]  who go to vote in Oregon and Alaska and Florida
[03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:35.460]  and Washington District of Columbia
[03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:37.020]  on the first Tuesday in November.
[03:11:37.020 --> 03:11:39.700]  If you show up, you'll never need to think
[03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:40.660]  about this ever again.
[03:11:40.660 --> 03:11:42.540]  You'll just be allowed to enjoy.
[03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:44.740]  You'll be allowed to be part of a culture
[03:11:44.740 --> 03:11:47.100]  that ought to be one of the most respected cultures
[03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:49.780]  in the history of mankind, because I'll tell you this.
[03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:52.980]  The cannabis culture is given more to humanity
[03:11:52.980 --> 03:11:56.220]  and mankind, humankind, in science and entertainment
[03:11:56.220 --> 03:11:58.580]  and theater and arts, books and culture,
[03:11:58.620 --> 03:12:01.300]  and especially in music than any other culture
[03:12:01.300 --> 03:12:03.060]  of the last hundred years.
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:05.100]  The cannabis culture is one of the greatest cultures
[03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:06.140]  in the history of mankind,
[03:12:06.140 --> 03:12:08.460]  starting with William Shakespeare, who smoked marijuana.
[03:12:08.460 --> 03:12:10.300]  Cannabis, actually.
[03:12:10.300 --> 03:12:13.860]  So many great poets and writers and musicians
[03:12:13.860 --> 03:12:17.020]  and scientists and doctors and explorers,
[03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:21.140]  and to this day, are movers and shakers.
[03:12:21.140 --> 03:12:25.340]  Bill Gates, Stephen Jobs, pot smokers.
[03:12:25.340 --> 03:12:27.500]  Carl Sagan, pot smoker.
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:30.060]  Every musician you've ever cared to really enjoy
[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:30.900]  a pot smoker.
[03:12:30.900 --> 03:12:33.580]  Most of the people who write today's great bestsellers
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:35.540]  and make today's great movies are pot smokers,
[03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:36.700]  including actors.
[03:12:37.620 --> 03:12:39.540]  We are a great culture,
[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:41.780]  but we have been denied our official right
[03:12:41.780 --> 03:12:43.580]  to be regarded as first-class citizens
[03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:46.060]  like everybody else who makes contributions
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:49.180]  and who ought to be acknowledged as a culture.
[03:12:49.180 --> 03:12:52.100]  And so if they'd have told me 25 years ago,
[03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:54.700]  Mark, it's gonna be a long road with a lot of difficulties,
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:58.860]  but one day in 2015, one day it all becomes real
[03:12:58.860 --> 03:13:01.700]  if you can get your people to show up.
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:02.580]  So that's my message.
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:03.420]  Thanks very much.
[03:13:03.420 --> 03:13:05.140]  I look forward to parting with you tonight.
[03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:10.250]  All right, guys, that was Mark Emery.
[03:13:10.250 --> 03:13:13.890]  That video came from the Pot TV YouTube channel.
[03:13:13.890 --> 03:13:15.930]  I need to give a big shout out to Jodi Emery.
[03:13:15.930 --> 03:13:18.290]  I emailed Jodi and she gave me permission
[03:13:18.290 --> 03:13:21.410]  to use these videos, so we gotta give them a big thanks.
[03:13:21.410 --> 03:13:24.490]  I also need to give a big shout out to CannabisCulture.com
[03:13:24.490 --> 03:13:26.810]  if you want some great cannabis news.
[03:13:27.490 --> 03:13:28.890]  If you're online and not able to listen to a podcast,
[03:13:28.890 --> 03:13:31.450]  make sure you check out CannabisCulture.com.
[03:13:31.450 --> 03:13:33.730]  There's a lot of videos and updates from Mark.
[03:13:33.730 --> 03:13:36.850]  Also go to YouTube and check out the Pot TV channel.
[03:13:36.850 --> 03:13:39.650]  There are a lot of great Mark Emery videos.
[03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:42.250]  I will start, I'll try to play some Mark Emery videos
[03:13:42.250 --> 03:13:43.850]  at the end of the episodes that are short.
[03:13:43.850 --> 03:13:45.490]  That way we can fill in a little time.
[03:13:45.490 --> 03:13:47.770]  If the episodes are long, I won't put that in there.
[03:13:47.770 --> 03:13:49.890]  We'll just try to get them closer to an hour.
[03:13:49.890 --> 03:13:51.050]  All right, guys, I'm high and rambling,
[03:13:51.050 --> 03:13:52.650]  so let's get back to the regular part of the show.
[03:13:52.650 --> 03:13:53.890]  Thanks for listening to Mark Emery.
[03:13:53.890 --> 03:13:55.490]  Support those guys.
[03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:56.970]  So, hey, Adam, dude,
[03:13:56.970 --> 03:13:58.210]  you made it through a whole nother episode.
[03:13:58.210 --> 03:13:59.450]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[03:13:59.450 --> 03:14:00.450]  Hey, thanks, man.
[03:14:00.450 --> 03:14:02.370]  You make the episodes go a little bit smoother.
[03:14:02.370 --> 03:14:04.170]  It's better than me sitting here talking to myself
[03:14:04.170 --> 03:14:06.370]  and looking at the wall like I'm a schizophrenic.
[03:14:06.370 --> 03:14:07.210]  I appreciate it.
[03:14:07.210 --> 03:14:11.010]  And yeah, like always, anytime you need.
[03:14:12.170 --> 03:14:15.690]  Where can these guys find you on the Twitter?
[03:14:15.690 --> 03:14:17.490]  Overgrowthegov on Twitter,
[03:14:17.490 --> 03:14:21.370]  and then the website is 420F.com.
[03:14:21.370 --> 03:14:23.170]  I've never checked out that website, guys, so.
[03:14:23.170 --> 03:14:24.010]  Games and fun.
[03:14:24.010 --> 03:14:25.410]  No, it's nothing bad.
[03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:27.050]  I apologize.
[03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:29.490]  You can find all of our Twitters and all that.
[03:14:29.490 --> 03:14:30.930]  Big shout out to my homie, Bender,
[03:14:30.930 --> 03:14:32.730]  and he's been working hard on the servers and stuff.
[03:14:32.730 --> 03:14:33.970]  We run game servers, so.
[03:14:34.890 --> 03:14:36.410]  You wanna come play some video games with Stoners?
[03:14:36.410 --> 03:14:37.250]  Come on.
[03:14:37.250 --> 03:14:38.250]  There you go.
[03:14:38.250 --> 03:14:40.530]  Who doesn't wanna play video games with Stoners?
[03:14:40.530 --> 03:14:43.810]  Guys, you can find me at Ireadgenetics on Instagram,
[03:14:43.810 --> 03:14:45.530]  at Igrowculture on Instagram,
[03:14:45.530 --> 03:14:47.370]  at Igrowculture on Twitter.
[03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:49.650]  Igrowculture has a Facebook.
[03:14:49.650 --> 03:14:50.530]  You can email us.
[03:14:50.530 --> 03:14:53.610]  It's Igrowculture at hotmail.com.
[03:14:54.610 --> 03:14:57.210]  I gotta give a huge shout out to DJ Nickatty.
[03:14:57.210 --> 03:14:59.010]  That's what's playing in the background.
[03:14:59.010 --> 03:14:59.850]  Big shout out.
[03:14:59.850 --> 03:15:02.090]  Thanks for letting me play the Summit Turn Up,
[03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:04.930]  the electronic dance hall music volume one.
[03:15:04.930 --> 03:15:07.250]  It's not even on the screen anymore, and I remembered it.
[03:15:07.250 --> 03:15:09.410]  So much respect to DJ Nickatty.
[03:15:09.410 --> 03:15:11.370]  Follow him on SoundCloud.
[03:15:11.370 --> 03:15:14.050]  And now that the show is over,
[03:15:14.050 --> 03:15:14.890]  or should I do this?
[03:15:14.890 --> 03:15:15.730]  Watch, just in case.
[03:15:15.730 --> 03:15:16.810]  All right, guys, and that was a little speech
[03:15:16.810 --> 03:15:17.650]  from Mark Emery.
[03:15:17.650 --> 03:15:18.810]  Thanks for listening to that.
[03:15:18.810 --> 03:15:21.770]  And if not, now that the show is over,
[03:15:21.770 --> 03:15:22.890]  please go to iTunes.
[03:15:22.890 --> 03:15:24.970]  Go to the iTunes store, search for Igrowculture.
[03:15:24.970 --> 03:15:25.850]  Find the review section.
[03:15:25.850 --> 03:15:27.050]  Give us a five-star rating.
[03:15:27.050 --> 03:15:28.170]  After that, type in a comment
[03:15:28.170 --> 03:15:29.650]  and let me know what you think of the show,
[03:15:29.650 --> 03:15:31.650]  and I'll read your comments on the show.
[03:15:31.650 --> 03:15:33.410]  And I'm really serious about that.
[03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:34.730]  If you're listening to us on Stitcher,
[03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:37.610]  please leave a comment there and give us a good review.
[03:15:37.610 --> 03:15:39.090]  All of those reviews help with the show
[03:15:39.090 --> 03:15:39.970]  move up in the rankings,
[03:15:39.970 --> 03:15:41.410]  which in turn get us more listeners.
[03:15:41.410 --> 03:15:43.530]  And I wanna spread my message to everyone
[03:15:43.530 --> 03:15:46.170]  who wants to grow and wants to learn more about cannabis.
[03:15:46.170 --> 03:15:48.890]  This is an important message to spread.
[03:15:48.890 --> 03:15:51.450]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes,
[03:15:51.490 --> 03:15:54.010]  Stitcher, and every single episode
[03:15:54.010 --> 03:15:57.930]  is on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[03:15:57.930 --> 03:15:59.770]  Big, huge shout-out to my ninja Spence.
[03:15:59.770 --> 03:16:01.170]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[03:16:01.170 --> 03:16:03.690]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:16:30.460 --> 03:16:34.260]  All right, Podcast World, that was episodes 25, 26, and 27
[03:16:34.260 --> 03:16:35.700]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:36.700]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[03:16:36.700 --> 03:16:37.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you
[03:16:37.780 --> 03:16:39.460]  about a service called Patreon.

[03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:55.240]  I would appreciate it.
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:16:56.460]  I'm not trying to get rich.
[03:16:56.460 --> 03:16:58.820]  Just a few people offered to make some contributions,
[03:16:58.820 --> 03:17:00.260]  so I created a way to do that.
[03:17:00.260 --> 03:17:02.640]  If you'd like to contribute, there is your way.

[03:17:19.420 --> 03:17:20.400]  YouTube channel.
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:22.160]  Currently, there are only 25 videos,
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:24.420]  but I promise I will post more.
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:25.620]  I think that's all I've got for you.

[03:17:33.460 --> 03:17:35.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, this file is getting really long.
[03:17:35.420 --> 03:17:37.660]  We're at three hours and 17 minutes,
[03:17:37.660 --> 03:17:38.980]  so I'm getting out of here.
[03:17:38.980 --> 03:17:40.700]  Thanks for letting me suck up all of your data plan
[03:17:40.700 --> 03:17:41.540]  this month, you guys.
[03:17:41.540 --> 03:17:43.620]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:45.220]  and give your mom a hug for me.
