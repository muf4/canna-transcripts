[00:00.000 --> 00:05.800]  Welcome back, Podcast World. It's time for Episode 394 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.800 --> 00:10.280]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds. If you need fresh seeds for your garden,
[00:10.280 --> 00:16.840]  I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[00:16.840 --> 00:20.920]  It's become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:20.920 --> 00:26.880]  Today I'm taking dabs of vanilla cookies batter from Apothecary Farms, and it tastes delicious.
[00:26.880 --> 00:31.760]  If you let the nail cool nice and cool, you get the real nice vanilla cream kind of a flavor out of it.
[00:31.760 --> 00:38.480]  If you're a savage and you hit it while the nail's a little bit hot, you get that spicy Durban Poison part of the Girl Scout cookies flavor.
[00:38.480 --> 00:45.440]  I really love both flavors, and it really gives me a great buzz. I really enjoy the vanilla cookies from Apothecary Farms.
[00:45.440 --> 00:48.720]  Big shout out to everybody at Apothecary. Big shout out to all three locations.
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.360]  They've got a Pueblo location. They've got a Colorado Springs location.
[00:52.400 --> 00:55.640]  By the time this comes out, they will have opened a Denver location.
[00:55.640 --> 00:59.880]  So big up and congratulations to all of my friends at Apothecary.
[00:59.880 --> 01:02.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be another repost episode.
[01:02.840 --> 01:06.960]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:06.960 --> 01:12.680]  In the timeline of those grow lessons, it has become time to clean up and reset our garden for the next run.
[01:12.680 --> 01:18.000]  I originally did this episode as number 327. I'm reposting it now as 392.
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.040]  So ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's clean up and reset our garden for the next run.
[01:23.040 --> 01:29.040]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:29.040 --> 01:32.680]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.720]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:37.720 --> 01:42.200]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:42.200 --> 01:44.840]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.080]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:49.920 --> 01:53.920]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.320]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:58.320 --> 02:01.680]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig
[02:06.720 --> 02:10.160]  because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:11.160 --> 02:20.250]  Welcome back, podcast world. It's time for episode 328 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:20.250 --> 02:24.250]  Thanks again for joining me. You know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[02:24.250 --> 02:29.250]  Today, I'm smoking Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[02:29.250 --> 02:34.250]  If you know me, you know I love the Stardog. I love the aroma. I love the flavor. I love the high.
[02:34.250 --> 02:40.250]  I love the way it grows. And of course, I love taking pictures of Stardog. She's a very photogenic strain.
[02:40.250 --> 02:45.250]  So today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary.
[02:45.250 --> 02:52.250]  Now, if you've been following the show lately, you've probably caught the episodes about determining ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[02:52.250 --> 02:57.250]  Then we did an episode about flushing your plants. Then we did an episode about harvesting.
[02:57.250 --> 03:02.250]  Then we did an episode about drying and curing your cannabis plants. Then we did an episode about trimming.
[03:02.250 --> 03:08.250]  Now, it is time to clean up the grow room and get restarted for the next cycle.
[03:08.250 --> 03:11.250]  Let's talk a little bit about after harvest cleaning.
[03:11.250 --> 03:15.250]  It sounds pretty basic, but there are a few things you may overlook.
[03:15.250 --> 03:20.250]  Now, if you had bugs or powdery mildew, you may want to step up your cleaning product.
[03:20.250 --> 03:22.250]  You may want to step up your cleaning regimen.
[03:22.250 --> 03:27.250]  But if you didn't have any bugs or any issues, I think a light bleach and water solution should work.
[03:27.250 --> 03:33.250]  Or maybe you might want to get yourself some Fizan and use 15 to 20 mL of Fizan per gallon of water.
[03:33.250 --> 03:35.250]  Use that to clean up your whole grow.
[03:35.250 --> 03:40.250]  Either way, whatever product you use, let's clean everything. Let's clean the walls.
[03:40.250 --> 03:46.250]  Wipe down every inch of every wall. Start at one section at the top and just work your way down and to the right.
[03:46.250 --> 03:50.250]  And then just keep going until you've covered every inch of that grow room.
[03:50.250 --> 03:55.250]  Also, if you can reach, scrub the ceiling. If you can't reach, find me. I can probably reach.
[03:55.250 --> 03:58.250]  If not, get a ladder. Scrub the ceiling.
[03:58.250 --> 04:06.250]  Let's clean it with either bleach and hot water or Fizan and hot water and just get anything off of there that may be hiding that we don't want in that grow room.
[04:06.250 --> 04:11.250]  Maybe you've got a spider mite up there chilling out. Maybe you've got a little bit of powdery mildew spore that you don't know about.
[04:11.250 --> 04:14.250]  Maybe there's a piece of pollen up there that you don't know about.
[04:14.250 --> 04:19.250]  Let's clean everything just to be sure. So clean the walls. Clean the ceiling.
[04:19.250 --> 04:25.250]  Clean your light reflectors. Clean the lights. The top of the lights, they're probably dusty up on top.
[04:25.250 --> 04:29.250]  The reflectors, they're dusty on the inside. Clean those things.
[04:29.250 --> 04:33.250]  Take this opportunity while the room's empty and clean everything, you guys.
[04:33.250 --> 04:38.250]  So take the light reflectors down if you think they need some cleaning. Clean them. Hang them back up.
[04:38.250 --> 04:43.250]  Clean your fans. Take the fans off of the wall. Take the little grate off the front.
[04:43.250 --> 04:51.250]  Unscrew the little thing that holds the blades on. Take the blades off. Clean the blades. I know they're dirty. Fans get disgusting.
[04:51.250 --> 04:58.250]  The grate on the back is filled with muck and hair and just weird random gunk that I can't even tell you what it is.
[04:58.250 --> 05:03.250]  Clean that shit out of there. You're probably going to be disgusted that you've been blowing that shit around in your grow.
[05:03.250 --> 05:08.250]  Clean your fans. While you're cleaning the fans, look at anything that moves air or blows air.
[05:08.250 --> 05:15.250]  Look at the air return on your dehumidifier. That thing's pulling in a bunch of water and a bunch of air and then it's blowing air back out.
[05:15.250 --> 05:20.250]  Does that filter need to be changed? Does that dehumidifier need to be cleaned off?
[05:20.250 --> 05:26.250]  Is the water line that's draining water out of your dehumidifier, is it gunky? Does it need to be cleaned?
[05:26.250 --> 05:32.250]  Is the reservoir that you're draining your dehumidifier water into starting to develop slime and algae?
[05:32.250 --> 05:36.250]  If so, you need to clean that. Stay on top of those sort of things.
[05:36.250 --> 05:41.250]  So clean the walls. Clean the lights. Clean the fans. Clean your dehumidifier. Dust everything.
[05:41.250 --> 05:47.250]  The top of everything is dusty. The top of everything is funky. You've been spraying pesticides in there.
[05:47.250 --> 05:52.250]  Imagine you sprayed some sticky pesticide like Azimax in there. Then it got dusty.
[05:52.250 --> 05:58.250]  It's just sticking to the Azimax. It's funky. It's gross. Clean everything. Wipe it and dust the tops of everything.
[05:58.250 --> 06:02.250]  Clean your hydro tables. If you've got tables in the room, clean them.
[06:02.250 --> 06:07.250]  If you've got trays and you can take them outside, take them outside. Spray them down with the hose.
[06:07.250 --> 06:10.250]  If you've got a power washer, hit them with the power washer.
[06:10.250 --> 06:14.250]  If those tables are real dirty, scrub them down with some Fizan. Scrub them down with some bleach.
[06:14.250 --> 06:17.250]  Make sure you rinse them out real good and just get them real clean.
[06:17.250 --> 06:21.250]  You guys, the Fizan is going to foam up. Be prepared for that. You're going to make foam with Fizan.
[06:21.250 --> 06:24.250]  And make sure you clean everything out when you're done using cleaning products.
[06:24.250 --> 06:29.250]  Clean out your tables and reservoirs really well if you use a cleaning product.
[06:29.250 --> 06:34.250]  But rinse the shit out of those hydro tables. Rinse the shit out of all your tubing and all of your lines.
[06:34.250 --> 06:37.250]  Clean that stuff so that it's not clogged and so there's no algae in there.
[06:37.250 --> 06:42.250]  Here's something people don't pay enough attention to. Clean the floor.
[06:42.250 --> 06:47.250]  Yes, I know. We just walk on the floor all day, right? Sweep it. Mop it. Clean it up.
[06:47.250 --> 06:53.250]  If you've got some sort of poly film or panda film on the floor, some sort of subfloor, does it need to be replaced?
[06:53.250 --> 06:59.250]  Are there holes in it? Has your poly or your panda film started stretching and getting holes from the staples?
[06:59.250 --> 07:02.250]  Do you need to duct tape some spots? Check that kind of stuff out.
[07:02.250 --> 07:07.250]  Clean your floors. Everything lands on the floor. The floor is gross. Clean it up.
[07:08.250 --> 07:15.250]  Also, here's something I should mention. If you've got light reflectors with glass on them so that they're air cooled, clean that glass.
[07:15.250 --> 07:21.250]  Take that glass out. Wipe that shit down with some Windex. Let it dry and put it back. Clean the reflector glass.
[07:21.250 --> 07:26.250]  Also, clean all of your air conditioner filters. Check them. Make sure they are clean.
[07:26.250 --> 07:31.250]  If you've got ducting anywhere, check your ducting. Make sure the ducting isn't bent in any weird places.
[07:31.250 --> 07:35.250]  Make sure there are no clogs. Make sure all of your duct is secured.
[07:35.250 --> 07:43.250]  Make sure it's duct taped or clamped somewhere so that the air you're trying to move away from the grow doesn't accidentally end up being blown right where you don't need it.
[07:43.250 --> 07:46.250]  If you've got a leak, that air is just going to come flying out of there.
[07:46.250 --> 07:50.250]  You may just be moving the heat from the light right back into the grow room.
[07:50.250 --> 07:55.250]  Then your air conditioner has to work harder. You can't figure out why the room isn't cooling down and it gets frustrating.
[07:55.250 --> 08:00.250]  Check all of your ducting. Check your carbon filter. Is that carbon filter still filtering?
[08:00.250 --> 08:06.250]  Can you smell the herb outside when you grow? Did anybody mention that your harvest stunk really badly?
[08:06.250 --> 08:09.250]  How long have you had that carbon filter? Did you write it down?
[08:09.250 --> 08:12.250]  You should know when that carbon filter needs to be replaced.
[08:12.250 --> 08:19.250]  A lot of the brands say they will last two years. I never believe in that. I've never had a carbon filter last two years.
[08:19.250 --> 08:26.250]  Also, that carbon filter cover. Maybe you're going to leave that filter there for two years and it's got that little dust cover on it.
[08:26.250 --> 08:31.250]  Take that ugly thing off, throw it in the washer with some OxiClean and clean that thing.
[08:31.250 --> 08:38.250]  Nobody wants to see your pictures of your black and gray carbon filter dust cover. That is gross.
[08:38.250 --> 08:41.250]  Also, you guys, get in there and clean out the reservoir.
[08:41.250 --> 08:48.250]  If you've got a reservoir that you mix your nutrients in or that you use as part of your hydro system that you're pumping your nutrients from right to your plants,
[08:48.250 --> 08:52.250]  clean that reservoir. Why wouldn't you want a clean, fresh start?
[08:52.250 --> 08:56.250]  You don't want biofilm and funk in there because that's going directly to your plants.
[08:56.250 --> 09:04.250]  Also, clean all of the tubing. I've already said that once, but clean it all because all that gunk will end up into your plants.
[09:04.250 --> 09:07.250]  Another thing we should remember to clean is the emitters.
[09:07.250 --> 09:14.250]  If you've got a hydro system with some sprayers or emitters or sprinklers at the end of a line, make sure you pop those emitters off and clean them.
[09:14.250 --> 09:17.250]  They like to get filled with some gunky funk.
[09:17.250 --> 09:22.250]  Now is the perfect opportunity to take all those off and clean them up real well.
[09:22.250 --> 09:28.250]  Another really important thing we can do while we've got the room taken down, we can decide if we need to replace any bulbs.
[09:28.250 --> 09:31.250]  How long have your bulbs been in the grow?
[09:31.250 --> 09:36.250]  Depending on what type of lighting you're using, it may be time to swap out some bulbs.
[09:36.250 --> 09:43.250]  When bulbs get old, they still draw the same amount of electricity, but they do not put out the same amount of light.
[09:43.250 --> 09:47.250]  So you're paying for that electricity and it is not making it to your plants.
[09:47.250 --> 09:50.250]  So check your bulbs and see if they need to be replaced.
[09:50.250 --> 09:54.250]  A good way to find out if they need to be replaced is to get a lumen meter.
[09:54.250 --> 09:58.250]  A lumen meter will measure how much light is coming from your bulb.
[09:58.250 --> 10:04.250]  If your bulb is putting out less than 75 or 80% of its maximum output, it is time to replace it.
[10:04.250 --> 10:07.250]  Now how do you know what the maximum output of that bulb is?
[10:07.250 --> 10:12.250]  The way to find that out is to buy a brand new bulb, put the bulb in your reflector and turn it on.
[10:12.250 --> 10:16.250]  Then you've got to wait a few minutes and let that bulb get to its maximum brightness.
[10:16.250 --> 10:20.250]  It takes a little while for the bulbs to heat up and get to the right spectrum and get all the way bright.
[10:20.250 --> 10:28.250]  Once it's bright and all the way heated up, go about 12 to 18 inches from that bulb and measure what the lumens are right there and write it down.
[10:28.250 --> 10:31.250]  Write down the date and the amount of lumens.
[10:31.250 --> 10:34.250]  Then check it now when you're cleaning the room.
[10:34.250 --> 10:38.250]  Go the same distance away with that lumen meter and see how many lumens are popping up.
[10:38.250 --> 10:44.250]  If you're not satisfied with the amount of power you're getting out of that bulb, it is time to replace it.
[10:44.250 --> 10:50.250]  If you feel like you're paying for electricity that is not making it to your plants, it is time to replace your bulb.
[10:50.250 --> 10:58.250]  Lumen meters may be expensive, but a lot of times the grow shop will let you borrow one because they know that if your bulbs are bad,
[10:58.250 --> 11:02.250]  you're probably just going to come by more bulbs when you return the lumen meter.
[11:02.250 --> 11:06.250]  Ask them at the grow store. They may have one available that you can borrow.
[11:06.250 --> 11:09.250]  Most of the cleaning stuff should be fairly obvious.
[11:09.250 --> 11:12.250]  Clean the shit out of everything. Scrub everything.
[11:12.250 --> 11:16.250]  If you're going to put plants in anything that had a cleaner in it, make sure you get that cleaner out.
[11:16.250 --> 11:19.250]  Replace the bulbs. Replace the filters.
[11:19.250 --> 11:25.250]  Some other things we may not remember to think about are check and reset your timers and all of your programs.
[11:25.250 --> 11:28.250]  If you've got your lights on a certain schedule, fix that schedule.
[11:28.250 --> 11:35.250]  If you've got your CO2 or your auto watering on a schedule, make sure you correct that schedule before you put new plants in here.
[11:35.250 --> 11:38.250]  Did daylight savings time happen? Check that.
[11:38.250 --> 11:42.250]  Is the timer on the right time? Is your timer on the right day?
[11:42.250 --> 11:46.250]  A lot of the controllers have a day that you can set. Is it Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday?
[11:46.250 --> 11:50.250]  Is it the proper day? Do you have AM and PM set properly?
[11:50.250 --> 11:57.250]  Make sure you check out all of your controllers before you put plants in there and you accidentally flower them way too early.
[11:57.250 --> 12:00.250]  Also, check out all of your CO2 controls.
[12:00.250 --> 12:05.250]  Another thing I like to do at this point in time is calibrate all of my pens and meters.
[12:05.250 --> 12:10.250]  I like to calibrate my pH pen. I like to make sure that my EC meter is working properly.
[12:10.250 --> 12:12.250]  These are all things that you should check on between harvests.
[12:12.250 --> 12:18.250]  I like to calibrate my meters about once every two weeks to tell you the truth, probably every ten days.
[12:18.250 --> 12:22.250]  I just like to check on them and make sure that those things are accurate.
[12:22.250 --> 12:27.250]  Another thing, you should have a fire extinguisher near your grow.
[12:27.250 --> 12:31.250]  Check on that. Look at the little gauge on there. Make sure it's in the green.
[12:31.250 --> 12:39.250]  If your fire extinguisher gauge is not in the green, either buy a new one or take it to the fire department and have it refilled correctly.
[12:39.250 --> 12:45.250]  I really hope you don't have to use that fire extinguisher, but if you need it, I really want it to work for you.
[12:45.250 --> 12:48.250]  Also, check the batteries in your smoke alarm.
[12:49.250 --> 12:53.250]  Yes, I said smoke alarm. Your grow should have a smoke alarm.
[12:53.250 --> 13:00.250]  You don't want to burn down the house because something went wrong in the grow room and you did not have a smoke detector and a fire extinguisher.
[13:00.250 --> 13:05.250]  Be a responsible grower. Make sure that the safety precautions are in place.
[13:05.250 --> 13:11.250]  Since we're checking on the fire extinguisher and the smoke alarm, it is a good time to check on your respirator.
[13:11.250 --> 13:16.250]  Are you using a respirator to apply pesticides? I really hope you're using something to keep yourself safe.
[13:16.250 --> 13:20.250]  If you're using a respirator, now is the time to check those cartridges.
[13:20.250 --> 13:25.250]  How long have they been on there? Is it time to replace them? Is that respirator clean?
[13:25.250 --> 13:30.250]  Maybe it's time to watch a Google video and learn how to properly clean and take care of your respirator.
[13:30.250 --> 13:34.250]  That thing is going to save your life over time. Take care of that.
[13:34.250 --> 13:40.250]  Also, it's a good time to replace your gloves. Do you need more nitrile gloves? Do you need more Tyvek suits?
[13:40.250 --> 13:46.250]  Now is a really good time to make a list and go to the grow store and stock up on those types of items.
[13:46.250 --> 13:53.250]  We've got the grow room nice and clean. We've checked all of our safety precautions. We've refilled all of the necessary supplies.
[13:53.250 --> 14:00.250]  Now is a good time to do a quick inventory of your pesticides and nutrients and any accessories you think you may need.
[14:00.250 --> 14:06.250]  If you're going to need pesticides or nutrients, start ordering that stuff now so that when you move your plants back into the room,
[14:06.250 --> 14:12.250]  you have got all of the nutrients and all of the supplies you need so that you don't miss a day of the grow cycle.
[14:12.250 --> 14:17.250]  We've got everything cleaned up. We've checked out all of our safety equipment. We've restocked all of our personal protective equipment.
[14:17.250 --> 14:23.250]  We've reordered all of our nutrients. Now, if we didn't have any problems with pests or powdery mildew,
[14:23.250 --> 14:28.250]  it is time to start running that room and get it prepared for the next cycle.
[14:28.250 --> 14:33.250]  Now, if you did have pests or problems, there are a couple of more steps that we need to take.
[14:33.250 --> 14:37.250]  We need to clean this room thoroughly. We need to spray it with some products.
[14:37.250 --> 14:43.250]  We might want to go a little harder with the bleach water. We might want to go a little harder with some Fizan.
[14:43.250 --> 14:46.250]  You might want to get a product called Pro-Cure.
[14:46.250 --> 14:52.250]  If you had powdery mildew, you're going to want to spray something to get rid of the spores in that room.
[14:52.250 --> 14:57.250]  If you had bugs, I would recommend spraying some sort of pesticide through the entire room.
[14:58.250 --> 15:03.250]  Just mix up your pesticide sprayer, your pump sprayer. If you don't have one, go get one from Lowe's.
[15:03.250 --> 15:08.250]  Get a good one. Get a deck sprayer that can handle bleach because you're going to be putting some chemicals in here.
[15:08.250 --> 15:13.250]  They're not that expensive. You just need one that holds about a gallon, maybe two gallons of water.
[15:13.250 --> 15:19.250]  Fill it up with water. Put your cleaning product in there, whether it's Fizan, whether it's Pro-Cure,
[15:19.250 --> 15:24.250]  whether it's a bunch of bleach. Maybe you want to use granulated sulfur if you had a PM issue.
[15:24.250 --> 15:27.250]  Mix that up. Spray the shit out of the entire room.
[15:27.250 --> 15:31.250]  This is your best opportunity to spray everything and eliminate your problem.
[15:31.250 --> 15:36.250]  There are no plants in there, so you can use products that you wouldn't spray when you've got plants in there.
[15:36.250 --> 15:38.250]  Get in there and clean the shit out of the room.
[15:38.250 --> 15:41.250]  I would start with the normal cleaning I recommended.
[15:41.250 --> 15:45.250]  Take everything down and clean it, then put it back up, then set up the room.
[15:45.250 --> 15:52.250]  Before you put the plants in there, go in there with this extra hard commando cleaning spray and go really hard.
[15:52.250 --> 15:57.250]  You've got to get all of the bugs out of there, or you're just going to bring plants in there,
[15:57.250 --> 16:01.250]  and they're going to get bugs or they're going to get PM, and you're going to have another struggling harvest.
[16:01.250 --> 16:04.250]  Nobody likes to struggle through a harvest.
[16:04.250 --> 16:07.250]  Now we've taken everything apart. We've cleaned the shit out of the room.
[16:07.250 --> 16:10.250]  We've replaced the bulbs. We've replaced all of our filters.
[16:10.250 --> 16:14.250]  We have calibrated all of our equipment. We've got new protective equipment.
[16:14.250 --> 16:18.250]  We have tested our safety equipment. We've put the room back together.
[16:18.250 --> 16:20.250]  We've gone in there and done another final spray.
[16:20.250 --> 16:26.250]  Maybe we hit it with Fizan. Maybe we sprayed Pro-Cure on everything to try to get rid of our problems.
[16:26.250 --> 16:30.250]  Maybe we just sprayed bleach water, real hot bleach water in there.
[16:30.250 --> 16:33.250]  Maybe we went in there with some H2O2. That would work really well also.
[16:33.250 --> 16:38.250]  But if you use any type of product like that, you guys, make sure you wear personal protective equipment,
[16:38.250 --> 16:40.250]  some goggles, and a respirator.
[16:40.250 --> 16:43.250]  You don't want to spray bleach. You don't want to spray H2O2.
[16:43.250 --> 16:47.250]  You don't want to spray Fizan without some sort of protective equipment.
[16:47.250 --> 16:49.250]  It will be terrible for your eyes, terrible for your skin.
[16:49.250 --> 16:51.250]  Please take care of yourself.
[16:51.250 --> 16:57.250]  And if you're using a sprayer to spray anything, please use some sort of respiratory protection.
[16:57.250 --> 16:58.250]  Please.
[16:58.250 --> 17:02.250]  Now once the room is put back together, here is something I suggest.
[17:02.250 --> 17:05.250]  I would turn on the lights. I would turn on your blowers.
[17:05.250 --> 17:08.250]  I would turn on the fans. I would turn on the air conditioner.
[17:08.250 --> 17:10.250]  And I would let everything run for a few minutes.
[17:10.250 --> 17:12.250]  And I would stand in the room and pay attention.
[17:12.250 --> 17:15.250]  Is there anything wrong? Is there anything you could dial in?
[17:15.250 --> 17:17.250]  Is there anything you could adjust?
[17:17.250 --> 17:19.250]  Do it while you're in there.
[17:19.250 --> 17:23.250]  Then, go outside and walk around your grow space.
[17:23.250 --> 17:26.250]  If your grow is at your house, just go walk around the house.
[17:26.250 --> 17:31.250]  Just go pick up trash around the house or whatever and see if you can identify any light leaks.
[17:31.250 --> 17:33.250]  Do you see light coming out of your grow room?
[17:33.250 --> 17:37.250]  If you see light coming out, there is light going in.
[17:37.250 --> 17:40.250]  We do not want and cannot have light leaks in our grow room.
[17:40.250 --> 17:43.250]  So, walk around the house. Walk around the perimeter.
[17:43.250 --> 17:45.250]  Identify any possible light leaks.
[17:45.250 --> 17:49.250]  Also, listen. Do you hear the blowers? Do you hear the fans?
[17:49.250 --> 17:51.250]  Do you hear your air conditioner?
[17:51.250 --> 17:56.250]  Is anything outside making it obvious that you're running a grow in that house?
[17:56.250 --> 18:01.250]  This is a good time to discover that we've got light leaks or that we've got noisy equipment
[18:01.250 --> 18:03.250]  so that we don't get ourselves in trouble.
[18:03.250 --> 18:05.250]  You do not want to attract law enforcement.
[18:05.250 --> 18:08.250]  It may be legal where you grow. It is legal where I grow.
[18:08.250 --> 18:12.250]  I am still stealth because you know who's worse than law enforcement?
[18:12.250 --> 18:13.250]  Fucking thieves.
[18:13.250 --> 18:16.250]  You don't want people to know you've got a grow in your house
[18:16.250 --> 18:22.250]  because somebody may come and take your crop from you.
[18:22.250 --> 18:25.250]  That is a real thing. Keep that in mind.
[18:25.250 --> 18:28.250]  You have to be careful even in a legal state.
[18:28.250 --> 18:30.250]  Keep your grow stealth.
[18:30.250 --> 18:32.250]  So, walk around outside.
[18:32.250 --> 18:36.250]  Look, listen, smell, pay attention.
[18:36.250 --> 18:39.250]  See if anything is going wrong outside.
[18:39.250 --> 18:42.250]  Once you're sure that everything is fine outside,
[18:42.250 --> 18:44.250]  that's when you can go back in the grow room,
[18:44.250 --> 18:46.250]  turn off the lights in the grow room,
[18:46.250 --> 18:48.250]  and stand in there for about 10 minutes.
[18:48.250 --> 18:50.250]  Let your eyes adjust.
[18:50.250 --> 18:54.250]  Now is the time to find out if any light is leaking into the grow.
[18:54.250 --> 18:57.250]  Now is the time to find out if the sunshine from outside
[18:57.250 --> 19:00.250]  is coming through your ducts for your vented hoods
[19:00.250 --> 19:03.250]  right into your light reflectors into your grow room
[19:03.250 --> 19:06.250]  and shining light on your plants during a dark period.
[19:06.250 --> 19:08.250]  Now is the time to find that out.
[19:08.250 --> 19:10.250]  Now, the catch to these last two things,
[19:10.250 --> 19:13.250]  you're only going to be able to tell if you have a light leak outside
[19:13.250 --> 19:16.250]  if you go walk around the house and it's dark outside.
[19:16.250 --> 19:18.250]  The only way you can tell if you have a light leak inside
[19:18.250 --> 19:21.250]  is if it's light outside and you go in the grow room
[19:21.250 --> 19:24.250]  and you turn off the lights on the inside of the grow room.
[19:24.250 --> 19:27.250]  So, you're going to have to find the time of day to do that.
[19:27.250 --> 19:30.250]  You're going to have to do some investigating and some inspecting,
[19:30.250 --> 19:33.250]  these are very important details to not overlook.
[19:33.250 --> 19:35.250]  Make sure your grow room is lightproof.
[19:35.250 --> 19:38.250]  Make sure there's not a lot of noise coming out of there.
[19:38.250 --> 19:43.250]  And also, find out if you've got too much aroma and correct it if you do.
[19:43.250 --> 19:46.250]  You don't want to attract attention that you don't need.
[19:46.250 --> 19:48.250]  Once you've been growing for a while,
[19:48.250 --> 19:50.250]  or if you're somebody who is looking for grows,
[19:50.250 --> 19:53.250]  so say myself, I've been growing for a long time.
[19:53.250 --> 19:55.250]  When I used to go walk my dog in my neighborhood,
[19:55.250 --> 19:57.250]  I would always discover a new grow.
[19:57.250 --> 19:58.250]  I would go a different route.
[19:58.250 --> 20:01.250]  I'd go two blocks that way, three blocks that way, a block that way,
[20:01.250 --> 20:04.250]  and then I'd come back and then the next day I'd just do a different pattern.
[20:04.250 --> 20:07.250]  I would always find a new grow about once a week
[20:07.250 --> 20:10.250]  because I know what I'm looking for, listening for, and smelling for.
[20:10.250 --> 20:12.250]  I know the details. I know the clues.
[20:12.250 --> 20:15.250]  If I hear your weird blower at 3 in the morning going,
[20:15.250 --> 20:17.250]  vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, from your basement window,
[20:17.250 --> 20:19.250]  chances are you've got a grow in there.
[20:19.250 --> 20:23.250]  If you've got an air conditioner in your basement window in the middle of winter,
[20:23.250 --> 20:25.250]  chances are there's a grow in there.
[20:25.250 --> 20:28.250]  If you've got one window by the basement that has no snow
[20:28.250 --> 20:31.250]  and the rest of the backyard is snowy, there's a grow in there.
[20:31.250 --> 20:35.250]  If there's one spot on your roof above one bedroom that there's no snow on it,
[20:35.250 --> 20:37.250]  there's a grow in there.
[20:37.250 --> 20:39.250]  There are really easy signs that give it away,
[20:39.250 --> 20:42.250]  so pay attention, you guys, because if I can see it,
[20:42.250 --> 20:45.250]  law enforcement can see it, and so can the thieves,
[20:45.250 --> 20:47.250]  so be careful with your grow.
[20:47.250 --> 20:50.250]  Try to stay stealth even in legal states.
[20:50.250 --> 20:53.250]  There's no reason to brag. There's no reason to set bait.
[20:53.250 --> 20:58.250]  All right, Podcast World, I feel like that is a pretty good clean and reset episode.
[20:58.250 --> 21:01.250]  Hopefully I mentioned some details that you would have overlooked.
[21:01.250 --> 21:04.250]  Hopefully I rescued you through a couple of pitfalls.
[21:04.250 --> 21:06.250]  Now you don't have to make those mistakes.
[21:06.250 --> 21:10.250]  Hopefully everything was well in your grow and you don't have any problems.
[21:10.250 --> 21:12.250]  Hopefully you don't have anything funky to deal with.
[21:12.250 --> 21:17.250]  Also, now that the grow is nice and clean, let's fucking keep it clean.
[21:17.250 --> 21:20.250]  Let's get in there with a mop and a broom every day if we need to
[21:20.250 --> 21:22.250]  and mop and sweep that bitch.
[21:22.250 --> 21:26.250]  Let's get in there with a shop vac and suck out, you know, that shit in the corner you've been looking at?
[21:26.250 --> 21:28.250]  Get the fucking shop vac and vac that out.
[21:28.250 --> 21:32.250]  It's not going to shop vac itself, and that's a great place for a spider mite to hang out.
[21:32.250 --> 21:35.250]  That's a great place for some aphids to hang out and breed.
[21:35.250 --> 21:38.250]  That's a great place for some powdery mildew to start.
[21:38.250 --> 21:40.250]  That is just a vector for problems.
[21:40.250 --> 21:43.250]  So now that you've got it nice and clean, don't be lazy.
[21:43.250 --> 21:46.250]  Get in there and clean it as often as you can.
[21:46.250 --> 21:49.250]  They say that cleanliness is godliness,
[21:49.250 --> 21:52.250]  and I think that most applies in kitchens and grow rooms, you guys.
[21:52.250 --> 21:53.250]  So clean up that grow room.
[21:53.250 --> 21:55.250]  Give yourself a nice, clean environment.
[21:55.250 --> 21:57.250]  Give your plants a nice, healthy start.
[21:57.250 --> 21:59.250]  I think your plants will be more comfortable,
[21:59.250 --> 22:03.250]  and I think you will also notice working in a cleaner, more organized environment
[22:03.250 --> 22:05.250]  will make you happier.
[22:05.250 --> 22:07.250]  It'll make you faster and more productive.
[22:08.250 --> 22:10.250]  And shit, now that you're done cleaning up the grow room,
[22:10.250 --> 22:12.250]  why don't you clean up all your supplies?
[22:12.250 --> 22:13.250]  Go organize your nutrients.
[22:13.250 --> 22:17.250]  Go organize the pesticides, the measuring devices, your cleaning supplies.
[22:17.250 --> 22:19.250]  Go write down a list of anything that you can need,
[22:19.250 --> 22:21.250]  anything that you're low on.
[22:21.250 --> 22:22.250]  Go get yourself organized.
[22:22.250 --> 22:26.250]  Also, get a notebook and start making detailed notes.
[22:26.250 --> 22:29.250]  Start documenting when you changed your bulb.
[22:29.250 --> 22:32.250]  Start documenting when you changed your carbon filter.
[22:32.250 --> 22:36.250]  Start documenting the last time you changed your air conditioner filters
[22:36.250 --> 22:37.250]  and calibrated your meters.
[22:37.250 --> 22:40.250]  Start writing that stuff down so that when something comes up,
[22:40.250 --> 22:41.250]  you can look in there and go,
[22:41.250 --> 22:43.250]  oh, that's why my pH meter isn't working.
[22:43.250 --> 22:45.250]  I haven't calibrated the fucking thing in two months.
[22:45.250 --> 22:49.250]  You may find some things you were slipping on if you start taking more notes.
[22:50.250 --> 22:51.250]  All right, podcast world.
[22:51.250 --> 22:55.250]  I feel like that pretty much wraps up my clean and reset the grow room episode.
[22:55.250 --> 22:56.250]  I want to thank you guys for listening.

[24:10.250 --> 24:13.250]  I want to thank everybody once again for listening to a rambly podcast.
[24:13.250 --> 24:16.250]  I will be back in a few days with a fresh new episode.
[24:16.250 --> 24:18.250]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Mama Bear Dabs.
[24:18.250 --> 24:22.250]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[24:24.250 --> 24:28.250]  All right, Podcast World, that concludes a long series of grow lessons.
[24:28.250 --> 24:30.250]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the grow lessons.
[24:30.250 --> 24:33.250]  I want to thank you again for listening to the repost episodes.

[24:37.250 --> 24:40.250]  and I also hope you're going to have more fun in your grow with the knowledge
