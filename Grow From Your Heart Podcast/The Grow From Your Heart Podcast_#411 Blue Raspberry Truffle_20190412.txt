[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  Hey, it's time for episode 411 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.420 --> 00:06.860]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:06.860 --> 00:10.980]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:10.980 --> 00:16.900]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:16.900 --> 00:21.020]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:21.020 --> 00:25.820]  I just took a nice fat dab of Samoa Kush from Nomad Concentrates.
[00:25.820 --> 00:27.800]  This stuff tastes delicious.
[00:27.800 --> 00:34.800]  The package says it contains 67.7% total THC, not a super high or impressive number, but
[00:34.800 --> 00:39.720]  it was really potent and the flavor and aroma was really impressive.
[00:39.720 --> 00:45.720]  I generally go for a more THC heavy sativa dominant style concentrate, but this one seems
[00:45.720 --> 00:46.880]  to have mellowed me out.
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.360]  It made me sit back in the chair a little bit and it kind of calmed me down.
[00:50.360 --> 00:53.280]  So this should be a fun podcast.
[00:53.280 --> 00:57.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do have a great episode planned for you, but before we get too far,
[00:58.480 --> 01:00.680]  let's do some shout outs for our friends on Patreon.
[01:00.680 --> 01:03.840]  Let's start off with a big shout out to our friend David O'Quinn.
[01:03.840 --> 01:08.000]  How about a big shout out to Ryan Schmidt, a huge shout out to Riley Hansen, a big Grow
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.040]  From Your Heart podcast shout out to John Milk, a big shout out to Sam, and of course,
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.340]  another Ganja Grower shout out to my friend Farmer John.
[01:17.340 --> 01:21.600]  Podcast world, this episode is going to be another strain review.
[01:21.600 --> 01:24.900]  If you've been following the podcast for a while, you know that I like to talk about
[01:24.900 --> 01:28.880]  strains that I have bred and feature them here on the podcast.
[01:28.880 --> 01:30.420]  Of course, I am I read genetics.
[01:30.420 --> 01:33.100]  I breed a lot of fine quality cannabis.
[01:33.100 --> 01:36.100]  I use a male plant known as a rise.
[01:36.100 --> 01:40.780]  I also make some feminized crosses with various selected females that are reversed and turned
[01:40.780 --> 01:41.780]  into males.
[01:41.780 --> 01:43.260]  That's a whole nother podcast.
[01:43.260 --> 01:47.860]  In this episode, we are going to focus on one of my new, most recent and most favorite
[01:47.860 --> 01:48.860]  creations.
[01:48.860 --> 01:49.940]  This will be the debut.
[01:49.940 --> 01:51.900]  Most of you haven't heard about this one yet.
[01:51.900 --> 01:56.940]  This is the first time we will talk about blue raspberry truffle here on the podcast.
[01:56.940 --> 02:01.380]  So ladies and gentlemen, pack up the bong, roll up a fat joint, heat up the dad nail,
[02:01.380 --> 02:06.260]  and let's talk a little bit about blue raspberry truffle.
[02:06.260 --> 02:11.380]  When this episode originally comes out, blue raspberry truffle will not be available.
[02:11.380 --> 02:16.820]  Blue raspberry truffle will not be available until 4-20, and it will be released first
[02:16.820 --> 02:22.540]  at Oregon Elite Seed Bank, and you can find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[02:22.540 --> 02:27.420]  So make sure you look for the blue raspberry truffle around April 20th on Oregon Elite
[02:27.420 --> 02:28.420]  Seeds.
[02:28.420 --> 02:34.300]  Also, I will have very limited packs with me at the Dude Grows Cup.
[02:34.300 --> 02:39.260]  So if you're at the Dude Grows Cup on April 13th at Cultivated Synergy, stop by the booth.
[02:39.260 --> 02:44.380]  You may have an opportunity to get some of the first released packs of the blue raspberry
[02:44.380 --> 02:45.380]  truffle.
[02:45.380 --> 02:48.900]  I'm not going to let things go at the events in person, face-to-face, before some of the
[02:48.900 --> 02:50.100]  vendors even have it.
[02:50.100 --> 02:52.940]  So this will be your first opportunity.
[02:52.940 --> 02:55.260]  So let's talk a little bit about blue raspberry truffle.
[02:55.260 --> 02:59.100]  What is this blue raspberry truffle that I keep talking about?
[02:59.100 --> 03:03.260]  Blue raspberry truffle is, of course, a cross of my Arise male.
[03:03.260 --> 03:06.540]  I've got a prized Arise male that I have named King Solomon.
[03:06.540 --> 03:09.380]  I use in many of my crosses.
[03:09.380 --> 03:13.980]  Arise is a golden goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[03:13.980 --> 03:15.500]  We'll briefly talk about Arise.
[03:15.500 --> 03:19.620]  I've done a full episode on Arise.
[03:19.620 --> 03:24.740]  It is episode 329, and I do a full feature of the strain Arise.
[03:24.740 --> 03:26.180]  We'll briefly talk about it here.
[03:26.180 --> 03:30.700]  Arise is a golden goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[03:30.700 --> 03:32.980]  Golden goat is kind of tropical, kind of sweet.
[03:32.980 --> 03:36.100]  It is Island Sweetskunk, Hawaiian sativa, and aromalan.
[03:36.100 --> 03:38.380]  So it's got that tropical sativa flavor to it.
[03:38.380 --> 03:40.020]  It's got a really nice head buzz to it.
[03:40.020 --> 03:43.580]  It is a really great growing plant, and it is very potent.
[03:43.580 --> 03:48.900]  The Daybreaker male used in that cross is Chem D, crossed to Joseph OG.
[03:48.900 --> 03:53.380]  The Chem D has kind of a fresh tennis ball, kind of a fresh rubber sort of a smell.
[03:53.380 --> 03:57.420]  And then, of course, Joseph OG smells like swampy, OG kush.
[03:57.420 --> 03:59.300]  It's kind of piney, kind of gassy.
[03:59.300 --> 04:01.660]  It's got kind of a really unique funk to it.
[04:01.660 --> 04:04.760]  So I like that one for its funky flavors and aromas.
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.360]  It had a short, squatty structure with really wide leaves, so it really contrasted that
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.820]  golden goat quite well.
[04:10.820 --> 04:15.820]  So I bred those two together, and I made that Arise cross.
[04:15.820 --> 04:19.860]  Out of those Arise seeds came a very standout male.
[04:19.860 --> 04:22.820]  That male has been known as King Solomon.
[04:22.820 --> 04:26.980]  King Solomon basically turbocharges everything he pollinates.
[04:26.980 --> 04:31.140]  You can take a plant that has great flavor and great trichome production, but maybe doesn't
[04:31.140 --> 04:34.020]  grow the best, and King Solomon will fix that growth.
[04:34.020 --> 04:35.900]  He gives plants hyper vigor.
[04:35.900 --> 04:37.780]  He also increases potency.
[04:37.780 --> 04:39.460]  He also increases yield.
[04:39.460 --> 04:41.980]  I feel like King Solomon is a very special plant.
[04:41.980 --> 04:45.720]  That is why I breed him to so many different things.
[04:45.720 --> 04:48.300]  So that is a quick rundown of King Solomon.
[04:48.300 --> 04:52.060]  King Solomon is the male I used in the Blue Raspberry Truffles.
[04:52.060 --> 04:54.740]  Now let's talk about the female that we used in this cross.
[04:54.740 --> 04:56.460]  I know I'm good at building suspense.
[04:56.460 --> 04:59.580]  Everybody wants to know what was the girl in that cross.
[04:59.580 --> 05:04.900]  The female that I used for the Blue Raspberry Truffle cross was the Blueberry Cookies cross,
[05:04.980 --> 05:10.260]  and that Blueberry Cookies is actually a cross of Blueberry Tahoe and Platinum Cookies.
[05:10.260 --> 05:17.300]  It's got a very, very blueberry dominant, kind of a blueberry Skittles, a Nerds kind
[05:17.300 --> 05:21.300]  of a flavor, and a really funky aroma going on.
[05:21.300 --> 05:25.020]  I've been working for a little while with the Blueberry Cookies, and I have only seen
[05:25.020 --> 05:26.460]  impressive results.
[05:26.460 --> 05:29.620]  I've ran the Blueberry Cookies in commercial environments.
[05:29.620 --> 05:31.580]  I've grown it in my personal grow.
[05:31.580 --> 05:36.140]  I have seen it grown in other grows by growers who are not as experienced by myself, and
[05:36.140 --> 05:38.580]  it always does a great job.
[05:38.580 --> 05:43.740]  The Blueberry Cookies was one of my favorite strains to smell, to grow, to smoke, to work
[05:43.740 --> 05:44.740]  with.
[05:44.740 --> 05:45.820]  I quickly fell in love with that.
[05:45.820 --> 05:50.880]  I had to cross it to my prized Arise King Solomon male.
[05:50.880 --> 05:51.880]  So I did that.
[05:51.880 --> 05:58.700]  I pollinated the Blueberry Cookies with my Arise male, and the offspring are impressive.
[05:58.820 --> 06:03.860]  I could tell early on in the veg phase that these plants were going to be impressive.
[06:03.860 --> 06:05.700]  They had amazing growth.
[06:05.700 --> 06:07.220]  Their structure was beautiful.
[06:07.220 --> 06:08.900]  They were perfectly shaped.
[06:08.900 --> 06:15.620]  And early in veg, I could smell a blueberry, sort of a rubbery tennis ball, sort of a burnt
[06:15.620 --> 06:19.420]  muffin sort of a thing coming off of these plants in their veg phase.
[06:19.420 --> 06:22.140]  So I was super excited to get these plants into flower.
[06:22.140 --> 06:26.340]  And when they went into flower, the aromas only intensified.
[06:26.340 --> 06:28.460]  These plants took off when I put them in flower.
[06:29.220 --> 06:31.500]  They did get kind of tall kind of quickly, but we're going to talk about the growing
[06:31.500 --> 06:32.660]  and stuff in a minute.
[06:32.660 --> 06:37.020]  Let's talk about the aromas and smoking this plant.
[06:37.020 --> 06:44.420]  While it was growing, it smelled like blueberries and almost like hot chocolate or really dark
[06:44.420 --> 06:47.300]  chocolate, which is where it got the truffle name from.
[06:47.300 --> 06:48.600]  The Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[06:48.600 --> 06:52.740]  It's got that blueberries with something sour, which is where the raspberry comes in.
[06:52.740 --> 06:54.940]  And then that dark chocolate was kind of truffle-y.
[06:54.940 --> 06:57.760]  Blue Raspberry Truffles was what I thought of the first time.
[06:57.760 --> 07:00.040]  It got real musty in the grow room.
[07:00.040 --> 07:06.800]  So it's kind of got a sort of a blue Skittles or a pack of Nerds and dark chocolate and
[07:06.800 --> 07:08.760]  blueberries is really dominant in there.
[07:08.760 --> 07:12.000]  So that is where it got the name is the Blue Raspberry Truffles.
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.420]  As it got older in flower, the truffle-y smell, that chem dog, OG Kush, Joseph OG really came
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.420]  out in it.
[07:20.420 --> 07:22.880]  It started off sweeter and more candy-like.
[07:22.880 --> 07:28.040]  Most of the phenotypes got a little bit more of the truffle-y flavor toward the end.
[07:28.040 --> 07:30.400]  Some of the plants, honestly, I let go too long.
[07:30.400 --> 07:33.040]  I should have cut some of them down a little bit earlier.
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.600]  I feel like there is a nice window with some of the phenotypes where it will change from
[07:37.600 --> 07:42.720]  that blueberry thing sort of over to a mustier, more of the truffle-y.
[07:42.720 --> 07:44.720]  It's got a foot kind of a thing going on.
[07:44.720 --> 07:49.120]  If you let it kind of transfer into that phase at the end, if you let it go a little bit
[07:49.120 --> 07:52.960]  too long, we're going to talk about those phenotypes here in just a minute.
[07:52.960 --> 07:57.840]  So as the grow went on, many of the phenotypes got a little bit mustier is the word that
[07:57.840 --> 07:58.840]  I like to use for it.
[07:58.840 --> 08:02.320]  A little more truffle-y, a little more dark chocolate, a little earthy is kind of the
[08:02.320 --> 08:05.060]  flavor and aroma I think I should be saying is earthy.
[08:05.060 --> 08:09.280]  They got a little more earthy, but when I cut them down, it kind of seemed like I just
[08:09.280 --> 08:12.760]  broke open the blueberry terp jar.
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.840]  It was just blueberries and raspberries and kind of a Skittle-y flavor just filled the
[08:17.840 --> 08:18.840]  room.
[08:19.560 --> 08:22.240]  It was crazy that it produced that much of a different aroma.
[08:22.240 --> 08:23.720]  I thought it was very interesting.
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.160]  So as it grew, it started off with the real blueberry raspberry sort of a thing.
[08:28.160 --> 08:34.080]  As it got older, many of the phenotypes shifted to sort of an earthy truffle kind of a flavor.
[08:34.080 --> 08:36.760]  Some of them did maintain their blueberry thing.
[08:36.760 --> 08:41.000]  We're going to talk about the phenotypes and the division of that in just a minute here.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.360]  But when I cut it down, it exploded with blue raspberry nerds.
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.480]  Remember those blue lollipops we used to get back in the day that would turn your whole
[08:49.480 --> 08:50.480]  face blue?
[08:50.480 --> 08:52.240]  It kind of reminded me of that.
[08:52.240 --> 08:57.440]  The flavor and aroma was very reminiscent of that blue raspberry lollipop and a package
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.440]  of nerds.
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.280]  So I cut it down, I dried it, I cured it.
[09:02.280 --> 09:06.760]  As I cured it, I noticed that that musty smell kind of got lighter.
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.440]  As it lightened, it balanced out the blueberries and the earthy smell really nicely.
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.000]  I think it really balanced them out very well to where the words blue raspberry truffle
[09:16.160 --> 09:18.360]  just made more sense as time went on.
[09:18.360 --> 09:21.360]  When I started smelling it, I was like, that's blue raspberry truffles.
[09:21.360 --> 09:25.120]  And as time went on, it just proved itself that that name was perfect for it.
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.260]  So I really think that it smells and tastes like a blue raspberry truffle.
[09:29.260 --> 09:30.600]  So I dried it, I cured it.
[09:30.600 --> 09:31.600]  Then what's next?
[09:31.600 --> 09:33.360]  I got to smoke it.
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.040]  First before we get there, let me say this stuff destroys a grinder.
[09:37.040 --> 09:38.340]  Your grinder will be sticky.
[09:38.340 --> 09:40.040]  Your fingers will be super sticky.
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.740]  This is some extremely resinous and sticky herb.
[09:43.740 --> 09:47.420]  So when I smoked it, I tried to roll a joint and it got really sticky.
[09:47.420 --> 09:52.500]  Maybe I needed to let it dry a little longer, but it was really sticky, but it tasted amazing.
[09:52.500 --> 09:54.780]  I had to try again and put it in a bowl.
[09:54.780 --> 09:57.380]  The bowl tasted even better.
[09:57.380 --> 10:00.080]  It had that blueberry thing come out right away.
[10:00.080 --> 10:05.420]  As soon as you hit it, it was like, ooh, that is blueberry Skittles or blueberry nerds or
[10:05.420 --> 10:08.180]  something really blueberry, like a blueberry muffin.
[10:08.180 --> 10:11.260]  Not the, not like the real blueberries.
[10:11.260 --> 10:13.700]  It smells like fake blueberries.
[10:13.700 --> 10:16.540]  Like if there were a blueberry air freshener, that's what it would be.
[10:16.540 --> 10:18.860]  Don't think it's fresh, fruity blueberries.
[10:18.860 --> 10:22.060]  This smells like straight up fake blueberries and candy.
[10:22.060 --> 10:25.980]  Like if they had blueberry candy turps at the candy store, that's what it would be like.
[10:25.980 --> 10:27.740]  It is not like a fruit blueberry.
[10:27.740 --> 10:32.380]  It is like a very powerful, almost a sour blueberry candy.
[10:32.380 --> 10:34.340]  And it is delicious.
[10:34.340 --> 10:37.820]  But as soon as that green bowl started to burn, that blueberry aroma hit the room.
[10:37.820 --> 10:41.300]  It was like you cracked open a blueberry air freshener and then it was like, ooh, that's
[10:41.300 --> 10:42.300]  delicious.
[10:42.300 --> 10:45.660]  But then on the exhale, that's where that warm, cushy flavor comes through.
[10:45.660 --> 10:50.140]  So it filled the room with sweet blueberries and then right after cushion truffles.
[10:50.140 --> 10:51.620]  So that was pretty nice.
[10:51.620 --> 10:54.900]  It gave me intense cotton mouth immediately.
[10:54.900 --> 11:01.300]  It was finally a drink, but it tasted so good that I did not want to drink anything to wash
[11:01.300 --> 11:03.760]  away that complex flavor.
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.820]  It's really neat when you've got, you go, hmm, blueberry, ooh, and chocolate.
[11:08.820 --> 11:10.080]  Your brain has to figure that out.
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.480]  You're going, ooh, how did I get such a range of flavors?
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.400]  I really enjoy that wide range of flavors.
[11:15.400 --> 11:19.080]  It was very reminiscent of some of the old blueberry strains I've smoked back in the
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.080]  day.
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.520]  Also very similar to the blueberry cookies mom that it came from, but also that arise.
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.560]  It took that chem D flavor and it really put the tennis balls of the chem D, that chocolate
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.360]  flavor that chem D sometimes has.
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.260]  It really brought that out into this cross.
[11:35.260 --> 11:37.280]  So the cotton mouth happens instantly.
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.880]  The high is crazy.
[11:38.880 --> 11:41.280]  The head high comes on super quickly.
[11:41.280 --> 11:43.760]  When you hit it, you're like, oh, I'm high now.
[11:43.760 --> 11:45.600]  And I smoke a lot of dabs.
[11:45.600 --> 11:50.260]  So to notice a bowl or a joint of flour come on that quickly, that means that it is potent.
[11:50.260 --> 11:52.200]  So the head buzz comes on quickly.
[11:52.200 --> 11:53.200]  It went to my eyes.
[11:53.200 --> 11:54.640]  It kind of went behind my eyes.
[11:54.640 --> 11:58.600]  It made my eyes feel heavy, but not like droopy, like they were being pushed on.
[11:58.600 --> 12:00.280]  Kind of intense.
[12:00.280 --> 12:01.280]  I was high.
[12:01.280 --> 12:02.280]  I was really high.
[12:03.200 --> 12:05.160]  And then it kind of slowly drifts over my body.
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.160]  I could feel it.
[12:06.160 --> 12:08.480]  It went from my brain and then it was like, oh, I'm really high.
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.480]  I'm really high.
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.240]  And then I felt it like kind of irradiate down my spine, across my shoulders, down my
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.240]  arms.
[12:14.240 --> 12:17.240]  And then it worked its way all the way down my back to my hips and my knees and my shoulders
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.600]  are kind of where a lot of my pain and stress are.
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.560]  I keep my attention in my shoulders, into my gut.
[12:21.560 --> 12:23.600]  And then my knees are just stressed because I'm old.
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.760]  So it gets to the knees and it relaxes them.
[12:25.760 --> 12:28.280]  And my whole body just feels like it's in a cozy blanket.
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.400]  I described it the other day as a superhero cape because it just made me feel good.
[12:31.520 --> 12:33.400]  I was like, I want to get up and do some shit.
[12:33.400 --> 12:34.400]  And somebody's like, what do you want to do?
[12:34.400 --> 12:36.720]  I was like, I don't really know.
[12:36.720 --> 12:38.080]  I just want to get up and do some shit.
[12:38.080 --> 12:41.440]  I didn't really have any goals or anything, but I felt like I should be doing something,
[12:41.440 --> 12:42.440]  damn it.
[12:42.440 --> 12:43.440]  But I love it.
[12:43.440 --> 12:44.440]  It comes on super quickly.
[12:44.440 --> 12:45.440]  It spreads throughout your body.
[12:45.440 --> 12:46.760]  It makes you feel all warm and tingly.
[12:46.760 --> 12:48.700]  It is a really great feeling.
[12:48.700 --> 12:53.020]  If you've got some pain, I'm sure that this one would be great for your pain.
[12:53.020 --> 12:55.220]  So that is a basic smoke report.
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.520]  It tastes amazing.
[12:56.520 --> 12:57.900]  The smoke was great.
[12:57.900 --> 13:02.220]  My first sample, I did not let dry long enough, but once I let it dry and cure properly, it
[13:02.220 --> 13:05.980]  really had a great, amazing flavor and it burned beautifully.
[13:05.980 --> 13:12.180]  So now let's talk a little bit about the growing aspect of our blue raspberry truffle.
[13:12.180 --> 13:16.620]  Most of the time, the first question people ask is how long does it take?
[13:16.620 --> 13:20.380]  I would recommend nine weeks, maybe a little longer, but you probably don't need to go
[13:20.380 --> 13:24.100]  past 10 weeks, maybe 72 days at the absolute longest.
[13:24.100 --> 13:26.780]  I don't think it would take any longer than that.
[13:26.780 --> 13:28.420]  I've gone 72 days.
[13:28.420 --> 13:32.940]  Honestly, some of the phenotypes had gone too long at that point.
[13:32.940 --> 13:33.980]  Growth structure.
[13:33.980 --> 13:38.760]  She gets a little bit tall, but she makes huge colas.
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.340]  If you've seen pictures of a rise, if you've seen pictures of the blueberry cookies, you
[13:42.340 --> 13:46.080]  know that both of those plants make monstrous top colas.
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.060]  These plants will get tall on you quickly, but it is worth it because they put out quite
[13:50.060 --> 13:51.400]  a bit of weight.
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.820]  You will have big, fat, chunky colas that are covered in trichomes.
[13:55.860 --> 13:59.900]  If you've seen photos of the blueberry cookies, if you've seen photos of any of the arise
[13:59.900 --> 14:02.720]  crosses, all of them are coated in trichomes.
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.380]  This one is just like that.
[14:04.380 --> 14:07.220]  It will put on a layer of crusty trichomes.
[14:07.220 --> 14:09.420]  So you'll have giant colas.
[14:09.420 --> 14:12.540]  These plants grow with what I call hyper vigor.
[14:12.540 --> 14:17.260]  I have had a few people tell me that plants crossed with the rise grow too quickly for
[14:17.260 --> 14:22.940]  them and they need to reduce their veg time by at least one full week.
[14:23.060 --> 14:27.060]  Be prepared for fast growing, hyper vigorous, tall plants.
[14:27.060 --> 14:29.540]  These will take off on you.
[14:29.540 --> 14:31.900]  They do like to be topped and spread out.
[14:31.900 --> 14:35.500]  If you are the type of person that tops your plants, you can top these.
[14:35.500 --> 14:39.680]  They will make a giant glory cola at the top if you do not top them.
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.280]  If you choose to top them, you're going to get nice branching that's going to spread
[14:43.280 --> 14:44.660]  out very far.
[14:44.660 --> 14:46.380]  You'll have a nice full canopy.
[14:46.380 --> 14:47.740]  These plants can take some abuse.
[14:47.740 --> 14:48.740]  They like to be cracked.
[14:48.740 --> 14:49.740]  They like to be popped.
[14:49.740 --> 14:51.020]  They like to be twisted.
[14:51.140 --> 14:53.180]  These plants like to get worked into a trellis.
[14:53.180 --> 14:57.780]  If you've got a net or something like that, I highly recommend a trellis system.
[14:57.780 --> 15:02.460]  If not, you're going to need some sticks, some stakes, some cages, or something to keep
[15:02.460 --> 15:04.580]  some of these taller, bigger buds up.
[15:04.580 --> 15:07.740]  When they get big, they may get a little bit floppy.
[15:07.740 --> 15:10.100]  I recommend you top them and spread them out.
[15:10.100 --> 15:12.080]  I like to spread out my plants kind of far.
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.780]  These are going to get a little bit bushy on you when you top them.
[15:15.780 --> 15:20.380]  Blue raspberry truffles can take a shit ton of nutrients in my experience.
[15:20.740 --> 15:24.780]  I have only grown this plant in soilless mix and cocoa.
[15:24.780 --> 15:26.500]  I've tried to feed it too hard.
[15:26.500 --> 15:28.300]  I gave it a little bit too much shine.
[15:28.300 --> 15:29.980]  It didn't react too poorly to me.
[15:29.980 --> 15:31.620]  It can take a beating.
[15:31.620 --> 15:35.100]  I really like to push my plants, and I really like to see what they can take.
[15:35.100 --> 15:38.580]  The blue raspberry truffle can really take a lot of nutrients.
[15:38.580 --> 15:40.060]  I've grown it in the cocoa.
[15:40.060 --> 15:41.860]  I've grown it in the soil.
[15:41.860 --> 15:45.220]  It can really take abuse in both of those.
[15:45.220 --> 15:49.740]  Blue raspberry truffle will react a little bit poorly if she gets too hot.
[15:50.100 --> 15:54.260]  You'll get taco leaves, and it will stunt her growth, and she will get extra stretchy.
[15:54.260 --> 15:56.060]  She's already a stretchy plant.
[15:56.060 --> 15:58.780]  If you get her too hot, she will start stretching on you.
[15:58.780 --> 16:01.900]  She wants to get away from herself and away from the other plants.
[16:01.900 --> 16:04.180]  She wants to stretch out and find some fresh air.
[16:04.180 --> 16:06.220]  She will get growing when she gets too hot.
[16:06.220 --> 16:09.620]  She also does that if you cram her in with too many other plants.
[16:09.620 --> 16:12.100]  She wants to be up high, so she will grow.
[16:12.100 --> 16:13.100]  Give her space.
[16:13.100 --> 16:14.100]  Top her.
[16:14.100 --> 16:15.980]  Maybe give her a trellis to hold her down.
[16:15.980 --> 16:18.180]  But if it gets too hot, you'll get taco leaves.
[16:18.180 --> 16:21.060]  You'll get massively slowed production from this plant.
[16:21.060 --> 16:22.540]  So don't get it too hot.
[16:22.540 --> 16:26.060]  Now, I'm sure at that point, somebody's going to say, what is too hot?
[16:26.060 --> 16:29.580]  There are so many variables to think about when you ask that question.
[16:29.580 --> 16:31.460]  Which phenotype are you working with?
[16:31.460 --> 16:34.420]  What is the rest of your VPD looking like in the room?
[16:34.420 --> 16:35.620]  It may be able to take more heat.
[16:35.620 --> 16:40.340]  If you've got CO2, I'm not exactly sure what to tell you on what is too hot.
[16:40.340 --> 16:42.940]  Some of them will react poorly to too much heat.
[16:42.940 --> 16:44.320]  So keep an eye out for heat stress.
[16:44.320 --> 16:47.220]  The first thing you're going to see is those leaves at the top.
[16:47.260 --> 16:50.300]  They'll start pointing straight up at the light, and then they will start tacoing.
[16:50.300 --> 16:51.780]  It looks like they're praying.
[16:51.780 --> 16:52.780]  That is not what's happening.
[16:52.780 --> 16:55.020]  That plant is telling you, I'm a little bit too hot.
[16:55.020 --> 16:59.080]  Please raise the light, or please top me, or please bend me down so I'm not getting
[16:59.080 --> 17:00.500]  a sunburn.
[17:00.500 --> 17:04.260]  So that is the basic grow breakdown of the blue raspberry truffles.
[17:04.260 --> 17:05.260]  Nine to 10 weeks.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.900]  10 weeks should be plenty.
[17:06.900 --> 17:09.300]  I found that she can take a lot of nutrients.
[17:09.300 --> 17:11.820]  I haven't burned this plant, and I have tried.
[17:11.820 --> 17:13.660]  So she can take a lot of nutrients.
[17:13.660 --> 17:16.400]  I would suggest giving it a lot with this plant.
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.640]  You are more likely to underfeed than you are to overfeed.
[17:20.640 --> 17:22.440]  Make sure you give her lots of space.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.080]  Spread her out, and make sure she doesn't get too hot, because that is the one thing
[17:26.080 --> 17:28.040]  she really does not like.
[17:28.040 --> 17:32.080]  I have seen a lot of beautiful colors come from the blue raspberry truffle.
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.520]  A lot of dark colors.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.880]  A lot of dark purples.
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.720]  A lot of gold and amber colors toward the end of flower.
[17:37.720 --> 17:39.640]  She really makes gorgeous colors.
[17:39.640 --> 17:43.920]  I really like to drop the temperatures late in flower in my grow room.
[17:43.920 --> 17:46.800]  And for the last few days, I will really bring out the cold.
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.040]  I really saw a lot of color changing when the room got colder.
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.400]  Also I did throw a couple of plants in the dark for 24 hours, and they turned gold and
[17:55.400 --> 17:56.680]  purple on me.
[17:56.680 --> 17:58.840]  So it will give you a lot of beautiful colors.
[17:58.840 --> 18:02.640]  Get the temperatures down low toward the end of flower, and I really think you will see
[18:02.640 --> 18:04.540]  the beauty come out of this plant.
[18:04.540 --> 18:06.360]  It is powdery mildew resistant.
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.080]  I haven't seen powdery mildew on the blue raspberry truffle yet, so that is a bonus.
[18:11.080 --> 18:15.080]  Another bonus is this plant loves to make resin.
[18:15.080 --> 18:17.840]  There is a lot of resin on the blue raspberry truffles.
[18:17.840 --> 18:22.040]  You will see phenotypes that it looks like the trichomes are fighting for space.
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.080]  So let's move into talking about phenotypes of blue raspberry truffles.
[18:27.080 --> 18:30.880]  This is a really stable hybrid in my opinion.
[18:30.880 --> 18:34.400]  Some of the phenotypes are blueberry cookies dominant.
[18:34.400 --> 18:35.400]  They're very skittlesy.
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.240]  And I say skittlesy.
[18:37.240 --> 18:42.480]  They smell like a bag of skittles, more like a bag of blue raspberry candies, or possibly
[18:42.480 --> 18:43.480]  those blue nerds.
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.240]  If you eat blue nerds candies, that's kind of what it smells like to me.
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.120]  It's kind of sweet and sour and blueberry and delicious, and it is so wonderful.
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.480]  So you will have some phenotypes that are blueberry cookies dominant, and you will also
[18:56.480 --> 18:59.200]  have some arise dominant phenotypes.
[18:59.200 --> 19:04.540]  If you've got more of a lemon, more of a citrus type of a thing, that is very arise golden
[19:04.540 --> 19:06.080]  goat dominant.
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.880]  Now since the parent plants are very similar, it's going to be kind of hard to tell the
[19:10.880 --> 19:17.640]  difference between maybe a blueberry cookies dominant phenotype and an arise dominant phenotype.
[19:17.640 --> 19:21.840]  Both of those plants have a similar structure, a similar leaf shape and size.
[19:21.840 --> 19:25.360]  They're very different, but they are very similar to a new grower.
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.160]  They've both got long, skinny, pointy leaves.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.160]  They both grow tall.
[19:28.160 --> 19:30.260]  They both grow kind of branchy.
[19:30.260 --> 19:31.260]  They both branch out.
[19:31.260 --> 19:32.860]  They both have hyper vigor.
[19:32.860 --> 19:35.760]  So the main thing you're going to notice is the aroma.
[19:36.440 --> 19:38.560]  The aroma is really going to be what stands out the most.
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.320]  Now, yes, you are going to see phenotypes that will show you golden goat.
[19:42.320 --> 19:45.400]  You'll see phenotypes that will show you the daybreaker.
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.280]  The cross on the blueberry cookies is the blueberry Tahoe and platinum cookies.
[19:49.280 --> 19:50.860]  So you're going to see blueberry.
[19:50.860 --> 19:55.320]  You're going to see Tahoe OG, and you're going to see platinum cookies come out a little
[19:55.320 --> 19:59.060]  bit because you're going to find recessive traits from the grandparents.
[19:59.060 --> 20:04.080]  For the most part, these plants are going to look like arise that smells a lot like
[20:04.080 --> 20:05.080]  blueberry cookies.
[20:05.760 --> 20:09.720]  So you're going to find blueberry cookies, dominant phenotypes.
[20:09.720 --> 20:13.120]  Then you are going to find arise dominant phenotypes.
[20:13.120 --> 20:17.080]  Then in the mix, we are going to find 50 50 phenotypes.
[20:17.080 --> 20:18.080]  Let's talk about that.
[20:18.080 --> 20:22.760]  The arise phenotypes are going to be a little airier, a little fluffier, just a little more
[20:22.760 --> 20:23.760]  loose.
[20:23.760 --> 20:29.540]  Also, you may find that the arise dominant phenotypes will have a tropical citrus sort
[20:29.540 --> 20:30.580]  of a thing.
[20:30.580 --> 20:35.580]  You may also notice that the arise dominant phenotypes are a little bit stretchier, and
[20:35.580 --> 20:39.900]  I believe that that comes from the Joseph OG side of things.
[20:39.900 --> 20:44.740]  Now the blueberry cookies dominant phenotype seems to stay a little shorter, and the node
[20:44.740 --> 20:47.340]  spacing seems to stay a little bit tighter.
[20:47.340 --> 20:53.260]  You'll also see a little bit larger leaf from the blueberry cookies dominant phenotype.
[20:53.260 --> 20:56.440]  I think that comes from the platinum cookie side of things.
[20:56.440 --> 20:59.560]  Also the Tahoe OG has fairly large leaves.
[20:59.560 --> 21:04.000]  So there is one phenotype that is really tight, really sharp looking buds.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.040]  It's got little wider leaves toward the bottom.
[21:06.040 --> 21:07.840]  They get thinner leave toward the top.
[21:07.840 --> 21:11.800]  It kind of gets a nice a menorah shape toward the bottom, and it's got one glory cola that
[21:11.800 --> 21:12.920]  grows out of it.
[21:12.920 --> 21:16.160]  It's got a blueberry skittle sort of a smell to it.
[21:16.160 --> 21:19.040]  That is the blueberry cookies dominant phenotype.
[21:19.040 --> 21:21.960]  Then there is another phenotype that is very similar.
[21:21.960 --> 21:24.040]  Without a comparison, it is hard to tell the difference.
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.040]  It is also tall.
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.560]  It's got a big glory bud, but that bottom branching will be a little bit stretchier.
[21:29.560 --> 21:32.440]  It'll be a little bit further apart in node spacing.
[21:32.440 --> 21:35.140]  It won't have the blueberry skittles flavor.
[21:35.140 --> 21:40.280]  It will have more of a tropical sweet flavor along with that earthy flavor as a dominant
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.280]  sort of a thing.
[21:41.280 --> 21:43.680]  So that is the golden goat dominant phenotype.
[21:43.680 --> 21:44.680]  Then we've got the 50-50.
[21:44.680 --> 21:49.060]  The 50-50 is the one that smells like blueberries and dark chocolate.
[21:49.060 --> 21:52.020]  It is the blue raspberry truffle scented phenotype.
[21:52.020 --> 21:53.640]  I really enjoy that one.
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.080]  The lower leaves are a little broader as it gets taller.
[21:56.080 --> 21:57.440]  It gets the thinner leaves.
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.280]  The leaves get real long and skinny toward the top.
[22:00.280 --> 22:04.720]  My favorite phenotype of the blue raspberry truffle is the one with the shorter petioles.
[22:04.720 --> 22:07.160]  If the leaves are closer to the plant, the bigger sun leaves.
[22:07.160 --> 22:10.800]  If they're closer to the plant, that is one of my favorite phenotypes.
[22:10.800 --> 22:14.560]  The further out those petioles get, the more I feel like you're getting that golden goat
[22:14.560 --> 22:15.560]  trait.
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.200]  So I think we're getting more of the 50-50, more of the desirable one when we get in a
[22:19.200 --> 22:20.200]  little bit.
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.920]  Some of the leaves will hang down.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.360]  I've noticed more of the chocolate flavor comes from the plants with the leaves that
[22:27.360 --> 22:28.360]  droop.
[22:28.360 --> 22:29.840]  You'll see some that have droopy leaves.
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.320]  That doesn't mean the plant is thirsty.
[22:31.320 --> 22:33.600]  That does not mean the plant is overwatered.
[22:33.600 --> 22:35.000]  That comes from daybreaker.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.880]  That is a trait of the daybreaker male, which I used.
[22:37.880 --> 22:40.840]  That doesn't pop up a lot, but it comes out in this cross.
[22:40.840 --> 22:45.440]  So if you see the leaves drooping, that has potential of being a very chocolate, maybe
[22:45.440 --> 22:49.380]  a tennis ball, maybe a rubbery sort of a smelling phenotype.
[22:49.380 --> 22:51.320]  So we've got that blueberry cookies dominant.
[22:51.320 --> 22:53.740]  The real jagged, the real sharp looking one.
[22:53.740 --> 22:57.000]  We've got the arise dominant phenotype, the one that opens up a little bit.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.340]  It's not super tight.
[22:58.340 --> 22:59.580]  It's not super fluffy either.
[22:59.580 --> 23:03.200]  It just has more airspace than that blueberry cookies dominant phenotype.
[23:03.200 --> 23:06.240]  It's got more of a tropical smell, longer petioles.
[23:06.240 --> 23:08.080]  That is the golden goat dominant phenotype.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.080]  We've got the 50-50.
[23:09.080 --> 23:11.360]  It is that beautifully balanced mix.
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.920]  Nice tight buds, that blue raspberry truffles sort of aroma.
[23:14.920 --> 23:16.120]  It's got the blueberry skittles.
[23:16.120 --> 23:19.320]  It's got the chocolate kind of background going on to it.
[23:19.320 --> 23:23.000]  That is the desirable sought after phenotype in my opinion.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.700]  Then there's a phenotype that I have dubbed the weirdo.
[23:26.700 --> 23:29.000]  This one may be great for concentrates.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.200]  This one is a little bit airy.
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.680]  It is kind of a blueberry golden goat, but it kind of gets a little bit fluffy.
[23:35.680 --> 23:41.560]  I suspect it is probably a blueberry Hawaiian sativa is kind of what we've got going on,
[23:41.560 --> 23:45.920]  or perhaps maybe like a blueberry Hawaiian sativa is what kind of came out of that because
[23:45.920 --> 23:48.840]  it gets tall and it gets a little bit fluffy.
[23:49.360 --> 23:50.360]  It doesn't tighten up.
[23:50.360 --> 23:51.360]  It's quite airy.
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.680]  I think it would make great concentrates because it tastes very, very blueberry dominant.
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.020]  It brings out a really sweet blueberry sort of a thing, and it's just covered in trichomes,
[24:00.020 --> 24:02.200]  but it is not desirable for bag appeal.
[24:02.200 --> 24:03.520]  It wouldn't work good on the market.
[24:03.520 --> 24:04.520]  Nobody would want to buy it.
[24:04.520 --> 24:07.480]  They would want to smoke it a few times, but once they saw what it looked like, it would
[24:07.480 --> 24:08.980]  change their opinion.
[24:08.980 --> 24:11.620]  That is the one weirdo phenotype.
[24:11.620 --> 24:16.180]  From what I have experienced, and I've grown a lot of these seeds, from what I have experienced,
[24:16.180 --> 24:20.740]  I see the blueberry cookies dominant phenotype approximately 30%.
[24:20.740 --> 24:23.940]  I get the arise dominant approximately 30%.
[24:23.940 --> 24:26.220]  I get that 50-50%.
[24:26.220 --> 24:30.300]  That beautiful, the one I'm after comes up about 30% of the time.
[24:30.300 --> 24:35.660]  Then that fucking weirdo plant that pops up somewhere between 5 and 15%, just for math's
[24:35.660 --> 24:38.600]  sake at this time, we're going to say it comes up at 10%.
[24:38.600 --> 24:40.740]  You may see that weirdo in there.
[24:40.740 --> 24:45.740]  That weirdo is easy to identify early in flower because it just takes off immediately.
[24:46.300 --> 24:48.860]  It makes little tiny sparse bud sites right at the very beginning.
[24:48.860 --> 24:52.760]  You can tell everything else is starting to make, in my opinion, it looks like dandelions.
[24:52.760 --> 24:54.160]  This one doesn't make the dandelions.
[24:54.160 --> 24:56.060]  It just gets little tiny, tiny bud sets.
[24:56.060 --> 25:01.120]  You can see it just wants to build calyxes on calyxes, kind of like the old Dr. Grinspoon
[25:01.120 --> 25:02.120]  used to do.
[25:02.120 --> 25:05.900]  It'd just be real calyxy, but it also fluffs out like a diesel plant does.
[25:05.900 --> 25:09.640]  That probably comes from the chem D somewhere along the line.
[25:09.640 --> 25:11.580]  Those are the phenotypes you're going to look for.
[25:11.580 --> 25:12.900]  That is how it grows.
[25:12.900 --> 25:14.140]  That's how it smokes.
[25:14.140 --> 25:15.580]  That's what the buzz is like.
[25:16.420 --> 25:20.260]  That is my breeder breakdown on my new blue raspberry truffle.
[25:20.260 --> 25:24.180]  If you are into unique aromas, if you're into blueberries, if you're into fruitiness, if
[25:24.180 --> 25:28.340]  you're into skittles, if you're into earthiness, there are a lot of opportunities for great
[25:28.340 --> 25:31.140]  phenotypes in a pack of blue raspberry truffles.
[25:31.140 --> 25:35.700]  They'll be available at the Dude Grow Show on April 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[25:35.700 --> 25:43.660]  Then after that, your next opportunity will be from Oregon Elite Seeds at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[25:43.660 --> 25:46.740]  You can find a full lineup of Irie Genetics seeds there.
[25:46.740 --> 25:48.900]  Just go ahead and check out Oregon Elite Seeds.
[25:48.900 --> 25:51.780]  Go into the search bar, type in Irie Genetics.
[25:51.780 --> 25:55.700]  My name may not be on the right on the links yet because I'm fairly new to the website,
[25:55.700 --> 25:59.900]  but if you type it in, it should pop up or type in Arise or something like that, and
[25:59.900 --> 26:02.700]  it will bring up the Irie Genetics line.
[26:02.700 --> 26:06.460]  All right, podcast world, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
