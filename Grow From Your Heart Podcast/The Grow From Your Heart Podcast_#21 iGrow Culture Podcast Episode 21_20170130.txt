[00:29.810 --> 00:31.810]  And you can't compete, cause your rap is weak
[00:31.810 --> 00:34.810]  Have a seat, my numbers game is uncontained by a data sheet
[00:34.810 --> 00:37.810]  I run the game while you drag your feet
[00:37.810 --> 00:39.810]  I'm unashamed with my love for fame
[00:39.810 --> 00:42.810]  Cause my life was mundane, now it's feeling magnifique

[00:57.810 --> 01:00.810]  Welcome to episode number 21 of the iGrow Culture podcast
[01:00.810 --> 01:03.810]  I'm your host Ross the Jeff, thanks for joining me for another episode
[01:04.810 --> 01:06.810]  Man I've been smoking live resin today
[01:06.810 --> 01:08.810]  And I'm a little bit dabbed out
[01:08.810 --> 01:10.810]  A little more dabbed out than usual
[01:10.810 --> 01:13.810]  We're smoking some stuff called Bare Naked
[01:14.810 --> 01:15.810]  You don't know about the Bare Naked yet
[01:15.810 --> 01:19.810]  But when you hear about it you'll remember that you heard about it on iGrow Culture podcast first
[01:20.810 --> 01:23.810]  I wanna give a big shout out to Spence and the whole Garden of Weedon crew
[01:23.810 --> 01:26.970]  of Weed and Crew. They let me hang out for a couple hours tonight on the couch, take
[01:26.970 --> 01:31.490]  some dabs, talk a little bit, be social. It was fun. Thanks for the dabs. Thanks for the

[02:24.130 --> 02:27.530]  the song ended and it got real quiet. That was awkward. It's like when you're at a concert
[02:27.530 --> 02:30.570]  and you're yelling and then all of a sudden the song stops and all they can hear is you
[02:30.570 --> 02:35.530]  yelling. You're always saying a really stupid word at that time. So I had nachos in my butt
[02:35.530 --> 02:40.130]  or something like that. Yeah, Oil Slick, shout out to those guys. Send them a tweet. Tell
[02:40.130 --> 02:44.090]  them you're listening to the show. Big shout out to our friends at treethugger.com. This

[03:24.550 --> 03:30.070]  bonus for you. Hygro has an awesome sale on roots organic soil. You can get one tote of
[03:30.070 --> 03:37.070]  soil for $550 in-store pickup or $600 delivered. This deal is available at both locations,
[03:37.550 --> 03:43.390]  the Pueblo and Denver store. Please contact Hygro to verify delivery availability, delivery
[03:43.390 --> 03:47.710]  availability. I'm not sure how far those guys are willing to drive to haul you that tote
[03:47.710 --> 03:52.750]  of soil. So I'm sure a lot of guys are saying, how much is a tote of soil Rasta Jeff? It's
[03:52.750 --> 03:58.150]  a really good question. The answer is a tote of soil is 54 cubic feet, which is about 350
[03:58.150 --> 04:03.030]  gallons. It's all in one bag also. So instead of buying a whole bunch of separate bags,
[04:03.030 --> 04:07.910]  you got one big bag here, a little more eco-friendly. So if you're running three gallon pots, that's
[04:07.910 --> 04:14.910]  116 three gallon pots. If you run five gallon pots, that's 75 gallon pots. If you run seven
[04:15.030 --> 04:20.190]  gallon pots, like I like to do, that's 57 gallon pots. So that's not a bad deal at all
[04:20.190 --> 04:24.830]  there. So go get your dirt at Hygro indoor growing supplies. Let me read the address
[04:24.830 --> 04:31.830]  to you one more time. That is 6271 beach street unit F or the Pueblo location. That address
[04:32.070 --> 04:37.590]  is in Denver. The Pueblo location is 618 East fourth street in Pueblo on the East side.
[04:37.590 --> 04:42.590]  So go check out Hygro, much respect to all those sponsors. They make the show possible.
[04:42.590 --> 04:45.790]  Big shout out to you guys for listening. We've made it 21 episodes. You guys, that's
[04:45.790 --> 04:50.230]  pretty awesome. I've got a couple of things I wrote down. I wanted to talk about where
[04:50.230 --> 04:53.870]  did I put the paper? Oh, big shout out to natural mystic cannabis caregivers in Colorado
[04:53.870 --> 04:59.670]  Springs. I was running low on shatter. Natural mystic cannabis caregivers came to the rescue.
[04:59.670 --> 05:04.030]  I got some delicious. I'm reaching for the container right now. I'm also recording this
[05:04.030 --> 05:08.150]  podcast in video. I don't know if I will do anything with the video, but I am actually
[05:08.590 --> 05:12.510]  recording it. So this is Guava sky. I'm just showing the container from natural mystic
[05:12.510 --> 05:17.550]  cannabis caregivers and this is mystic is what it's called. The mystic has a Torah board
[05:17.550 --> 05:23.150]  in there. It's a high CBD mix and the Guava sky is the sativa that they had available.
[05:23.150 --> 05:29.370]  I got more of the sativa than I did the CBD mix. That's just my preference, but I'll show
[05:29.370 --> 05:33.110]  you the Guava sky for the guys with the camera. Also take a picture with the, uh, that are
[05:33.110 --> 05:36.790]  seeing the video. I'll take a picture and post this up online, but I'm not watching
[05:36.790 --> 05:39.550]  the video. So I don't know how clear that is. I'm going to stay still for a second so
[05:39.550 --> 05:44.150]  it can focus. So huge shout out to natural mystic cannabis caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[05:44.150 --> 05:47.950]  What's up, Joey? What's up, Shelley? I hope you guys listen much love. That's a great
[05:47.950 --> 05:51.950]  shop. If you do need medical marijuana, it does require a red card to get in there. So
[05:51.950 --> 05:55.190]  if you do need your medical marijuana, that's the place in Colorado Springs, I would send
[05:55.190 --> 06:02.830]  you right now. Uh, they have your back. Uh, Shelley's a, uh, a cancer survivor. Uh, so
[06:02.830 --> 06:05.830]  she knows what you're dealing with. If you're sick, she definitely knows how to help you
[06:05.830 --> 06:09.950]  out. She's compassionate. She's friendly. Uh, Joey's hard to find. He's the, uh, he's
[06:09.950 --> 06:13.710]  the boss there. So he's always busy working, but Joey's a great dude. He's super friendly.
[06:13.710 --> 06:16.310]  They'll shake your hand and spend a minute with you if he is in the shop. So shout out
[06:16.310 --> 06:21.710]  to those guys. I got much love for you. Uh, here's a little personal note today is, uh,
[06:21.710 --> 06:27.050]  as I'm recording it's four 20 in the morning on July 23rd. Uh, so it is officially the
[06:27.050 --> 06:31.790]  birthday of his Imperial majesty, King highly Celestia the first. So, uh, if you know what
[06:31.790 --> 06:35.910]  that is, who that is, uh, you understand why I'm giving thanks and praise, many thanks
[06:35.910 --> 06:40.830]  and praise, many a birthday blessings to King highly Celestia the first. Let's take a little,
[06:40.830 --> 06:45.190]  a little half a second of silence cause it's a podcast. A moment of silence would be ridiculous.
[06:45.190 --> 06:51.220]  So here's a half a second of silence for King Celestia the first. All right, we got to keep
[06:51.220 --> 06:55.580]  the show moving. Much respect. Um, I am sad to inform you. I'm going to turn the music
[06:55.580 --> 07:01.300]  way down for this one. Also. I'm sad to inform you. We had an event scheduled for July 27th
[07:01.620 --> 07:04.500]  at the brickyard. I've been talking about it quite a bit. We're trying to get that a
[07:04.500 --> 07:11.340]  hookah bar turned into a dab bar. Unfortunately it's not going to happen. The event is canceled
[07:11.340 --> 07:17.180]  and that place is not going to get to be turned into a smoking establishment. I apologize
[07:17.180 --> 07:22.620]  for advertising an event that didn't happen. Uh, the city is against us every step of the
[07:22.620 --> 07:26.820]  way. They do not want us to get this place open. They do not want us to have our event.
[07:26.820 --> 07:30.260]  I had planned on taking live plants to the event so that we could do a little bit of
[07:30.260 --> 07:34.500]  education and I could show a male plant, a female plant. I had plants in different
[07:34.500 --> 07:41.740]  stages of flower for this event, but, uh, we can't take plants that they, they, uh,
[07:41.740 --> 07:44.260]  said they would confiscate the plants. We can't risk taking plants and getting them
[07:44.260 --> 07:48.420]  taken. I just can't do that to myself. That's medicine for my patients. I'm a caregiver
[07:48.420 --> 07:52.860]  and they're going to need that medicine. So I can't do that. So unfortunately the event
[07:52.860 --> 07:58.020]  that I had planned that I had talked about for July 27th at the brickyard is canceled.
[07:58.020 --> 08:03.020]  Uh, we couldn't come to an agreement with the city. They do not want us to do the event.
[08:03.020 --> 08:06.900]  Uh, I don't want anybody to get in trouble. I don't want my plants to get taken. So we
[08:06.900 --> 08:13.220]  have, uh, we have backed out of the event and I do apologize for that. Uh, the other
[08:13.220 --> 08:16.700]  day I said something on the show. I don't remember if I said it on the show or just
[08:16.700 --> 08:21.140]  in a conversation with people, but I need to correct something that I said. I'm going
[08:21.140 --> 08:26.660]  to go to a website here. This is actually, uh, from Ed Rosenthal's. I've just got it
[08:26.660 --> 08:30.940]  on my computer. It's easier to do while we're doing a show. Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers
[08:30.940 --> 08:33.940]  handbook. I'm trying to show it to the camera. I'm not watching the video. I should put the
[08:33.940 --> 08:38.380]  video up on the screen so I could see the video feed. Uh, here we go. This is the book
[08:38.380 --> 08:44.660]  that, uh, I'm coming from. So I said something about red spectrum, right? And I may have
[08:44.660 --> 08:48.580]  gotten it backwards for what I told you guys. So this is from the book I just showed you.
[08:48.580 --> 08:51.980]  All credit for what I'm saying right now. It goes to Ed Rosenthal. Ed, don't get mad
[08:51.980 --> 08:56.180]  at me for saying this on the show. Uh, you'd want people to know this. It's called the
[08:56.180 --> 08:59.100]  critical light period. And let me give you a quick explanation of what the critical light
[08:59.100 --> 09:02.820]  period is in my opinion. And like a little quick, uh, cause you need to know that to
[09:02.820 --> 09:07.760]  get to where we are. The critical light period is the amount of dark time that a specific
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.740]  cannabis strain will take to flower. So let me elaborate with Ed's article here. I take
[09:13.740 --> 09:20.500]  a big breath cause I've been taking dabs. All right. This 12 to a formula has been accepted
[09:20.500 --> 09:25.580]  without question by growers all over the world. Probably, probably one of the reasons for
[09:25.980 --> 09:30.860]  this was my discussion of the technique in some of my early books. The 1212 regimen was
[09:30.860 --> 09:35.100]  selected because my coauthor and I reasoned that no matter what critical period of variety
[09:35.100 --> 09:40.260]  might have given 12 hours of darkness, it would flower. However, most marijuana varieties
[09:40.260 --> 09:46.060]  need fewer than 12 hours of darkness to flower. Now what I was talking about with somebody
[09:46.060 --> 09:50.460]  was they were saying that their plants are starting to flower and it's not 12 hours of
[09:50.460 --> 09:57.820]  darkness outside. Uh, yes, that's because of the sunset and the sunrise have specific
[09:57.820 --> 10:03.020]  color spectrums that are triggering hormones in your plants is what I was telling them.
[10:03.020 --> 10:06.860]  And I was calling all of this info from memory. So I think I got it backwards to tell you
[10:06.860 --> 10:11.060]  the truth. So, uh, if I said that on a podcast or if I said that to you in person, I need
[10:11.060 --> 10:15.580]  to correct that. Here's what Ed Rosenthal has written a little bit more about it. Uh,
[10:15.580 --> 10:20.140]  if marijuana plants grown outdoors required a 12 hour dark period to flower, they would
[10:20.140 --> 10:25.780]  not be induced to start flowering until September 21st, the first day of autumn, when day and
[10:25.780 --> 10:30.540]  night are equal length, they would ripen six to eight weeks later in real life. Most modern
[10:30.540 --> 10:35.260]  varieties ripened between early September and late October. Budding was triggered six
[10:35.260 --> 10:40.620]  to eight weeks earlier. For instance, an eight week variety that requires 55 days from forcing
[10:40.620 --> 10:46.660]  to maturity, which would normally ripen October 1st would start flowering August 1st at that
[10:46.660 --> 10:53.620]  day in San Francisco, sunrise occurs at five 14 and sunset at nine 18, which is seven 18,
[10:53.620 --> 10:59.380]  a total of 14 hours and four minutes dawn and dusk at another 15 minutes of red light
[10:59.380 --> 11:04.460]  plants use the absence of this spectrum to measure the dark period. The total lit period
[11:04.460 --> 11:09.940]  came to about 14 hours and 20 minutes, leaving nine hours and 40 minutes of darkness. The
[11:09.940 --> 11:15.140]  critical period for this plant was nine hours and 40 minutes. If it were given just 10 hours
[11:15.140 --> 11:20.420]  of dark period daily indoors rather than 12, it would still flower. gardeners growing
[11:20.420 --> 11:25.540]  indoors who discover the critical time need to induce flowering. The critical time needed
[11:25.540 --> 11:29.220]  to induce flowering can use this information to get more efficient use of their indoor
[11:29.220 --> 11:34.660]  garden. Currently plants grown under a 1212 cycle spend half their time in the dark. If
[11:34.660 --> 11:39.380]  these plants have a critical flowering time of for instance, 10 hours of darkness daily,
[11:39.380 --> 11:44.220]  they can provide be provided 14 rather than 12 hours of light each day so that they can
[11:44.300 --> 11:52.300]  receive almost 17% more energy, which they use to produce sugars used for more and faster
[11:52.300 --> 12:02.140]  growth. So does that make any sense you guys? It's the it's a called the critical period
[12:02.140 --> 12:07.020]  for the specific strain most of your your like cush strains your indica stuff that's
[12:07.020 --> 12:12.060]  going to have a critical period. Apparently closer to that's going to have like your 12
[12:12.060 --> 12:16.780]  hour stuff, your more equatorial stuff, you may be able to cut that down just a little bit.
[12:16.780 --> 12:26.460]  Actually, I heard DJ short say that he runs most of his plants on a it's 13 off 11 on and he said
[12:26.460 --> 12:32.700]  that that shows a little bit more phenotypical expression is what that does. Which means that
[12:32.700 --> 12:37.580]  if you're growing from seed and you're trying to find that keeper, you'll get to see larger
[12:37.580 --> 12:43.020]  variances in your seed stock. If you've got a little f1 hybrid there. I had another article,
[12:43.020 --> 12:50.460]  I got to click back a couple of steps here. Maybe I've lost it. Huh? I learned a whole lot of stuff
[12:50.460 --> 12:55.340]  about me. Here it is. Sorry, I hate to stumble do that. But looking for stuff on the internet
[12:55.340 --> 13:01.340]  while I'm talking. This guy broke something down. There are things cannabis plants. Where's this
[13:01.340 --> 13:06.940]  coming from? Let me give credit. This is from marijuana growers hq.com slash light cycles and
[13:06.940 --> 13:13.980]  flowering cannabis. Says cannabis plants are referred to as long night or short day plants
[13:13.980 --> 13:18.860]  because they require a long period of darkness to trigger the hormone that tell the plant to switch
[13:18.860 --> 13:24.620]  from vegetative growth to flowering. These light receptors are color pigments in the leaves called
[13:24.620 --> 13:29.500]  phytochrome red and phytochrome far red. And they're going to start abbreviating that. So I
[13:29.500 --> 13:33.420]  need to try to remember which is which these pigments get their names from the types of light
[13:33.420 --> 13:40.540]  they absorb. Phytochrome red absorbs red light between 600 and 760. It doesn't give me a definition
[13:40.540 --> 13:47.580]  of what those are. And phytochrome far red absorbs far light between 760 and 800 nm.
[13:49.500 --> 13:54.460]  I don't remember what nm is. And that's I should sorry, I went blank on that one just now when they
[13:54.460 --> 13:58.300]  wrote it on the screen. These two pigments chemically react to the light and trigger the
[13:58.300 --> 14:03.580]  plant to flower or not. This is where it gets a little confusing. In cannabis plants the normal
[14:03.580 --> 14:10.460]  presence of phytochrome far red switches off the flowering signal. The level of phytochrome far red
[14:10.460 --> 14:15.900]  is what you can manipulate to adjust the photo period. Phytochrome far red is quickly produced
[14:15.900 --> 14:22.620]  when plants are exposed to light that contains far red wavelengths. When there is light the
[14:22.620 --> 14:28.780]  phytochrome far red and phytochrome red maintain a balance. When the sun goes down or the lights go
[14:28.780 --> 14:34.940]  out the darkness gradually switches the phytochrome far red to phytochrome red. Because of this the
[14:34.940 --> 14:41.180]  phytochrome red levels gradually increase and the far red gradually decreases during the dark period.
[14:41.180 --> 14:46.540]  The presence of red is neutral is a neutral condition to the plants and essentially tells
[14:46.540 --> 14:52.220]  them nothing. When the light returns or if a small amount of far red light interrupts a dark period
[14:52.220 --> 14:57.980]  the red immediately switches back to far red. If the plant is without light long enough the far
[14:57.980 --> 15:04.300]  red will decrease past a tipping point. This decreased level of phytochrome far red signals
[15:04.300 --> 15:11.340]  the plants that fall is approaching and the plants begin flowering. In short the presence of phytochrome
[15:11.340 --> 15:17.260]  far red due to long hours of light and short hours of darkness keep the plants in the vegetative phase.
[15:17.260 --> 15:23.340]  If the plant experiences enough hours of darkness most of the phytochrome far red turns to
[15:23.340 --> 15:30.220]  phytochrome red and the low level of far red signals the plant hormones to begin flowering.
[15:30.220 --> 15:35.420]  That's a really technical version of what I tried to say the last time I gave this little rant and
[15:35.420 --> 15:39.740]  I think I got it completely backwards to tell you the honest truth. So that goes to show you right
[15:39.740 --> 15:43.580]  there that sometimes you got to do your research you got to remind yourself even if you think you
[15:43.580 --> 15:47.660]  know what you're doing you might f**k up and say something wrong on a podcast and try to embarrass
[15:47.660 --> 15:50.940]  yourself but you know I don't feel embarrassed now I'm glad that I got to learn with you guys.
[15:51.900 --> 15:55.580]  We're gonna go find out what that one little abbreviation that they wrote there I've never
[15:55.580 --> 15:59.900]  seen it written like that before I'm gonna find out what that means so I can share that with you.
[15:59.900 --> 16:06.140]  Where was it? Right there. I'm gonna google that and find out what that means.
[16:07.100 --> 16:13.320]  I'm googling it right now NM light
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.840]  measurement definition pops up as soon as I start typing that visible light is usually defined as
[16:20.840 --> 16:24.520]  having a wavelength okay so that's that is nanometers what I thought it was they just
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.240]  wrote it uh small n capital M and I haven't seen it like that so that's nanometers is what I thought
[16:29.240 --> 16:36.600]  it was there in that that article. All right doing pretty good on that one until Safari just decided
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.640]  to freeze up there we go cool all right so uh man this is gonna be a short episode I really just
[16:41.640 --> 16:48.360]  wanted to come on and uh talk about having to uh cancel the committee for the responsible regulation
[16:48.360 --> 16:53.080]  of cannabis uh party that we were going to have at the Brickyard. I want to say that once again in
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.560]  case you guys are skimming through this episode the party the seminar the educational seminar we
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.040]  planned to host it has been canceled uh I was going to take some live plants and show you guys
[17:02.040 --> 17:05.480]  those we had people that were going to talk about all kinds of cool stuff we had a miniature job
[17:05.480 --> 17:11.400]  fair planned out the uh city of Pueblo does not want that to happen so I apologize it's beyond our
[17:11.400 --> 17:15.320]  control the police department have threatened us and scared us and we don't want police interaction
[17:15.320 --> 17:20.360]  so uh we're gonna back out we're gonna bow down and just uh not do that sorry it's the best we can
[17:20.360 --> 17:27.480]  do right now for what we've got uh all right enough begging for uh your forgiveness I do apologize
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.320]  if you were planning to come out uh message me and we'll find something else to do how's that
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.880]  so if you're listening on twitter or facebook or whatever message me and we will uh we'll hang out
[17:37.880 --> 17:44.040]  since I had that night booked because I thought I'd be doing stuff anyway so uh yeah let's wrap
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.720]  up this episode it was kind of a quick episode I want to give another uh I want to mention that
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.760]  coupon or that ad that hygro pueblo and hygro denver are both doing you can get yourself a
[17:52.760 --> 18:01.480]  gigantic bag of roots organic soil for 550 bucks or 600 dollars uh honestly dude 25 seven gallon
[18:01.480 --> 18:09.400]  pots or 57 gallon pots worth of soil that's two runs in a four light room in my opinion you know
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.200]  so if that tells you anything with what you could do with that amount of soil that is awesome big
