[00:17.980 --> 00:20.300]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.300 --> 00:21.980]  It's time for episode number 178
[00:21.980 --> 00:23.700]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.700 --> 00:27.420]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.420 --> 00:28.460]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.460 --> 00:29.680]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.680 --> 00:32.100]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.100 --> 00:33.900]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.900 --> 00:36.480]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.480 --> 00:38.980]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.900 --> 00:41.660]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.460]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.500]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.100]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:47.140 --> 00:49.500]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.500 --> 00:53.340]  Big thanks to Kat, Koon, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.900 --> 00:56.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't going to be a long episode.
[00:56.860 --> 00:58.300]  I'm just coming in for a quickie.
[00:58.300 --> 01:00.420]  I'm gonna release this on a Thursday.
[01:00.420 --> 01:03.660]  You're very welcome for a Thursday bonus episode.
[01:03.660 --> 01:04.740]  Before I get to the main topic,
[01:04.740 --> 01:06.580]  I wanna do a little bit of bragging.
[01:06.580 --> 01:09.020]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friends at Organtica.
[01:09.020 --> 01:11.860]  Organtica is a medical marijuana dispensary
[01:11.860 --> 01:12.900]  in the state of New Mexico.
[01:12.900 --> 01:14.540]  They are located in Albuquerque.
[01:14.540 --> 01:16.460]  If you are in Albuquerque or a New Mexico
[01:16.780 --> 01:17.980]  medical marijuana patient,
[01:17.980 --> 01:20.220]  be sure to visit my friends at Organtica
[01:20.220 --> 01:23.020]  because I bred a strain called Arise.
[01:23.020 --> 01:26.100]  Arise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[01:26.980 --> 01:29.020]  These guys at Organtica got some seeds
[01:29.020 --> 01:30.540]  and they grew the Arise.
[01:30.540 --> 01:32.940]  And the Arise has been testing consistently
[01:32.940 --> 01:35.700]  in the high 20s to low 30s.
[01:35.700 --> 01:39.820]  Their most recent test tested at 32% THC.
[01:39.820 --> 01:44.820]  It was 35.84% THC A and 32% THC.
[01:45.820 --> 01:48.500]  It was tested by my friends at Steep Hill Lab.
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.500]  Congratulations and big shout out
[01:50.500 --> 01:54.860]  and much thanks and much love to everybody at Organtica.
[01:54.860 --> 01:56.620]  Shout out to everybody.
[01:56.620 --> 01:57.460]  And good job you guys.
[01:57.460 --> 01:58.660]  That's fucking amazing.
[01:58.660 --> 02:00.220]  You guys, that means I've got a strain.
[02:00.220 --> 02:04.220]  Currently, I hold the highest THC A test
[02:04.220 --> 02:06.220]  at Steep Hill Labs with the Arise.
[02:06.220 --> 02:07.900]  I did not grow it, but I bred it.
[02:07.900 --> 02:08.820]  It means a lot to me.
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.660]  It means there's a lot of potential in the Arise
[02:11.700 --> 02:15.220]  and a lot of potential in the strains I crossed
[02:15.220 --> 02:17.140]  with the Arise male.
[02:17.140 --> 02:18.740]  All right, so big shout out to everybody there.
[02:18.740 --> 02:21.140]  Also, shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:21.140 --> 02:23.500]  That's right, if you need some t-shirts, hoodies,
[02:23.500 --> 02:25.060]  any sort of clothing printed,
[02:25.060 --> 02:27.980]  I highly recommend our friends at Handmade Apparel.

[02:31.780 --> 02:33.500]  They are smokers, they are dabbers.
[02:33.500 --> 02:35.860]  They are putting together a really cool event right now.
[02:35.860 --> 02:37.540]  It is the Borro Derby.
[02:37.540 --> 02:40.940]  It will feature dinner, an auction, and borrow.
[02:40.940 --> 02:42.420]  I cannot wait to see how it goes.
[02:42.420 --> 02:44.100]  I'm really proud of my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[02:55.420 --> 02:56.740]  Check those guys out.
[02:56.740 --> 02:57.940]  Truly appreciate them.
[02:57.940 --> 02:59.140]  They do great work for the community.
[02:59.140 --> 03:01.380]  They printed my Grow From Your Heart hoodies.
[03:01.380 --> 03:02.460]  They look super sweet.
[03:02.460 --> 03:04.060]  They printed my iRegenetics t-shirts.
[03:04.060 --> 03:05.380]  They look super sweet.
[03:05.380 --> 03:08.420]  They have printed, they printed the Secret Sesh t-shirts.
[03:08.420 --> 03:09.500]  They printed my hat pins.
[03:09.740 --> 03:12.180]  These guys have put in a lot of work for us,
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.980]  and I will continue to use them
[03:13.980 --> 03:15.660]  because I support and respect them.
[03:15.660 --> 03:17.980]  Much love to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[03:17.980 --> 03:19.460]  All right, if I wanna keep this episode short,
[03:19.460 --> 03:20.620]  I need to quit rambling.
[03:20.620 --> 03:21.900]  I need to quit bragging.
[03:21.900 --> 03:24.660]  Let's move into the main topic of this podcast.
[03:24.660 --> 03:26.820]  You guys, this podcast is about something called
[03:26.820 --> 03:30.120]  seasonal affective disorder, also known as SAD,
[03:30.120 --> 03:31.660]  also known as winter depression.
[03:31.660 --> 03:34.780]  I wanna talk about winter depression and feeling sad
[03:34.780 --> 03:37.620]  and ways that some cannabis may help us out with this.
[03:38.340 --> 03:41.420]  Um, why do I wanna come up with a podcast about SADs?
[03:41.420 --> 03:44.620]  Because lately I have felt this funk in my head.
[03:44.620 --> 03:46.420]  I'm blaming it on this weather.
[03:46.420 --> 03:47.760]  I'm a California person.
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.000]  I'm from Southern California.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.320]  I grew up right near da beach, boy.
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.580]  Ah, yeah, that was fucking stupid, right?
[03:52.580 --> 03:53.900]  But it's okay, because I meant it.
[03:53.900 --> 03:55.020]  I'm seriously from the beach.
[03:55.020 --> 03:56.760]  I grew up 20 minutes from the beach.
[03:56.760 --> 03:58.140]  I used to go to Bolsa Chica Beach.
[03:58.140 --> 03:59.300]  I used to go to Huntington Beach.
[03:59.300 --> 04:00.760]  I used to go to Seal Beach.
[04:00.760 --> 04:02.820]  I used to be all over the beach, bro.
[04:02.820 --> 04:04.900]  Lifeguard Stand 23 at Bolsa Chica Beach
[04:04.900 --> 04:05.820]  used to be the spot.
[04:05.820 --> 04:06.820]  It's where the waves are ripping.
[04:06.860 --> 04:08.380]  It's where the kids could go do whatever we want.
[04:08.380 --> 04:09.900]  It's where the, I was a young kid.
[04:09.900 --> 04:11.580]  It was where the older kids could go smoke some dope.
[04:11.580 --> 04:13.180]  The even older kids would drink beer.
[04:13.180 --> 04:14.420]  Nobody gave a shit what we did.
[04:14.420 --> 04:15.260]  I'm a beach kid.
[04:15.260 --> 04:17.580]  I miss that constant sunshine.
[04:17.580 --> 04:19.840]  I miss just that vibe.
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.140]  I live in Colorado now.
[04:22.140 --> 04:25.940]  In about October, November-ish, it gets fucking cold.
[04:25.940 --> 04:27.540]  And it gets really dark.
[04:27.540 --> 04:29.700]  The days get really short, it feels like.
[04:29.700 --> 04:32.620]  I feel like the days didn't get as short in California.
[04:32.620 --> 04:35.160]  When the winter comes, the days feel shorter in Colorado.
[04:35.200 --> 04:37.560]  That just could be me being older and not being a kid.
[04:37.560 --> 04:40.440]  But it's fucking with my head, you guys.
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.560]  These dark, cold winter months,
[04:42.560 --> 04:45.520]  you can't go outside and do what you'd normally do.
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.560]  It's a little slower.
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.960]  You gotta get up early for work.
[04:47.960 --> 04:49.120]  You gotta defrost the car.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.240]  Joe Rogan put it best.
[04:50.240 --> 04:52.160]  Joe Rogan said there are states that are called,
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.720]  he calls them the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck states.
[04:54.720 --> 04:56.120]  Because when you get in your car to go to work
[04:56.120 --> 04:57.480]  in the morning, you spend three or four minutes
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.040]  sitting there going fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[04:59.040 --> 05:01.240]  Because you're so cold, your body can't do anything.
[05:01.240 --> 05:02.400]  Your stomach muscles tighten up,
[05:02.400 --> 05:04.640]  your brain starts twitching, your neck gets all stiff,
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.320]  and you just gotta wait for the car to defrost
[05:06.320 --> 05:08.160]  and so that you can drive to work.
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.460]  That shit sucks.
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.760]  Snow drives me crazy.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.600]  I don't like the cold.
[05:11.600 --> 05:12.420]  I don't like the snow.
[05:12.420 --> 05:14.480]  It feels to make me, it seems to feel like
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.200]  it makes me weak and slow down.
[05:16.200 --> 05:17.960]  It makes my bones and muscles hurt.
[05:18.940 --> 05:19.900]  I'm dealing with it.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.880]  I'm not enjoying the winter.
[05:21.880 --> 05:23.560]  I've got a lot of good friends that do a lot of cool shit,
[05:23.560 --> 05:24.400]  so don't let it slow me down.
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.040]  But I do feel it in the back of my head going, bro,
[05:26.040 --> 05:28.080]  something sucks, and it's just
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.720]  this seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[05:30.720 --> 05:31.760]  I wanna talk about a couple things
[05:31.760 --> 05:34.540]  that winter depression comes along with.
[05:35.380 --> 05:36.900]  And then we'll move into the cannabis part of this.
[05:36.900 --> 05:37.880]  I did a little research.
[05:37.880 --> 05:40.100]  It says it usually lasts from fall to springish.
[05:40.100 --> 05:42.520]  So if you're feeling a little funky from fall to spring,
[05:42.520 --> 05:43.620]  this is probably why,
[05:43.620 --> 05:46.680]  especially if you live in these winter colder climates.
[05:46.680 --> 05:49.260]  Some symptoms of this seasonal effective disorder
[05:49.260 --> 05:51.660]  include depression, just basic depression.
[05:51.660 --> 05:53.380]  It's not your classic depression.
[05:53.380 --> 05:56.300]  If you are feeling like hurting yourself or somebody else,
[05:56.300 --> 05:57.580]  or if you've got problems like that,
[05:57.580 --> 05:59.620]  if you're thinking about starting to drink alcohol
[05:59.620 --> 06:02.300]  or take pills or hurt yourself or cut yourself
[06:02.300 --> 06:04.820]  or break something or be an asshole to people,
[06:04.820 --> 06:07.220]  please get some help.
[06:07.220 --> 06:08.180]  Nobody's gonna judge you.
[06:08.180 --> 06:09.180]  Nobody's gonna hate you.
[06:09.180 --> 06:10.020]  We're gonna love you.
[06:10.020 --> 06:10.840]  We're gonna treat you right.
[06:10.840 --> 06:12.680]  If you wanna hurt yourself, if you wanna kill yourself,
[06:12.680 --> 06:14.140]  please call me.
[06:14.140 --> 06:15.700]  Fucking send me a Facebook message.
[06:15.700 --> 06:16.540]  We'll talk.
[06:16.540 --> 06:18.300]  Call Suicide Prevention Hotline.
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.340]  Call somebody.
[06:19.340 --> 06:21.180]  We probably don't know each other too personally.
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.740]  If you're embarrassed to call somebody, hit me up.
[06:22.740 --> 06:23.580]  I don't know you.
[06:23.580 --> 06:24.660]  I won't broadcast your business.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.980]  We'll talk about why you wanna hurt yourself
[06:25.980 --> 06:27.420]  and we'll fix that shit.
[06:27.420 --> 06:28.580]  That doesn't need to happen.
[06:28.580 --> 06:30.580]  So if you're really depressed, please get some help.
[06:30.580 --> 06:33.300]  But if you think you've got some winter seasonal depression
[06:33.300 --> 06:35.380]  we can help you with some cannabis suggestions.
[06:35.380 --> 06:39.060]  Another symptom here would be some laziness.
[06:39.060 --> 06:43.020]  Just low energy, lethargy, no desire to get out of bed.
[06:43.020 --> 06:45.100]  You just wanna lay around, put some blankets over you,
[06:45.100 --> 06:47.400]  maybe play on your phone and not do a damn thing.
[06:47.400 --> 06:49.260]  Losing interest in life.
[06:49.260 --> 06:53.380]  That's sort of an effect of the winter depression here.
[06:54.820 --> 06:56.700]  A lot of people have no desire to eat
[06:56.700 --> 06:58.720]  when this winter depression comes on.
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.380]  But oddly enough, the internet says
[07:01.140 --> 07:03.500]  that people will seek foods like carbohydrates
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.740]  and such during the winter, which is odd for me
[07:05.740 --> 07:07.480]  because I always like carbs.
[07:07.480 --> 07:09.160]  I like pizza and pasta and shit.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.660]  But it says that you're gonna seek out
[07:10.660 --> 07:12.780]  carbohydrate type salty foods
[07:12.780 --> 07:16.320]  if you are experiencing seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[07:16.320 --> 07:19.060]  It says you're gonna be agitated and irritable,
[07:19.060 --> 07:21.260]  which I am there.
[07:21.260 --> 07:23.780]  That's partly how I'm noticing this.
[07:23.780 --> 07:25.140]  I feel more tired.
[07:25.140 --> 07:25.980]  I feel grouchy.
[07:25.980 --> 07:26.880]  I feel fucking annoyed.
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.380]  And I'm pretty sure that it's mostly
[07:28.380 --> 07:31.840]  just this seasonal effective disorder.
[07:31.840 --> 07:33.900]  Another thing that the internet said
[07:33.900 --> 07:35.080]  that I totally relate to,
[07:35.080 --> 07:36.780]  and this is kind of what inspired me
[07:36.780 --> 07:37.700]  to wanna talk about this
[07:37.700 --> 07:41.700]  because it's part of where we are in this new generation,
[07:41.700 --> 07:43.180]  this new part of life.
[07:43.180 --> 07:46.420]  They said that this seasonal effectiveness disorder
[07:46.420 --> 07:48.740]  comes with panic attacks.
[07:48.740 --> 07:50.580]  And I think there's a reason for these panic attacks
[07:50.580 --> 07:52.220]  that we're getting now as humans.
[07:53.540 --> 07:57.320]  We are too attached to our computers and our devices.
[07:57.320 --> 08:00.660]  And as humans, we have become completely lazy
[08:00.660 --> 08:02.380]  and complacent.
[08:02.380 --> 08:06.640]  In the winter, I think that there's something inside of me
[08:06.640 --> 08:10.460]  that gives me this trigger to go hunt and gather food
[08:10.460 --> 08:13.320]  and build a fire so that I can keep the family warm
[08:13.320 --> 08:14.160]  through the winter.
[08:14.160 --> 08:17.080]  But now we all have jobs that don't require,
[08:17.080 --> 08:19.720]  most of us have jobs that don't require that sort of stuff.
[08:19.720 --> 08:20.600]  I work in a grow.
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.580]  I show up at a grow at six in the morning.
[08:22.580 --> 08:23.560]  I do grow stuff.
[08:23.560 --> 08:26.080]  I leave there at 6 p.m.
[08:26.080 --> 08:26.920]  I come home.
[08:27.480 --> 08:28.320]  I play on my computer.
[08:28.320 --> 08:29.140]  I live in a house.
[08:29.140 --> 08:30.200]  I drive a car.
[08:30.200 --> 08:32.160]  My food all comes from a store.
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.640]  I think that as humans, we were designed and built
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.900]  to be out there hunting our food.
[08:37.900 --> 08:40.140]  I should be out there chasing down deer or buffalo
[08:40.140 --> 08:42.400]  and killing that shit and dragging it in
[08:42.400 --> 08:44.280]  and then skinning it and cleaning it.
[08:44.280 --> 08:45.980]  Yes, I am a vegetarian and I'm saying this.
[08:45.980 --> 08:47.600]  This is part of why I think humans are fucked up
[08:47.600 --> 08:49.440]  because we're not doing this.
[08:49.440 --> 08:50.560]  There's something primal in us
[08:50.560 --> 08:52.540]  that makes us supposed to do that.
[08:52.540 --> 08:55.060]  And in the winter, that primal instinct to survive
[08:55.060 --> 08:58.100]  becomes even stronger because it's harder to survive.
[08:58.100 --> 08:59.980]  And in the environment where I am,
[08:59.980 --> 09:01.780]  it's even harder because it snows.
[09:01.780 --> 09:03.260]  I'm not saying that I'm in the worst conditions,
[09:03.260 --> 09:05.000]  but I mean, we get snow and it's fucking cold.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.820]  And if you don't have shelter and food and warmth,
[09:06.820 --> 09:08.740]  you will die out there.
[09:08.740 --> 09:11.740]  So our inside, our instinct,
[09:11.740 --> 09:15.380]  our natural design is to be hunting and gathering.
[09:15.380 --> 09:18.140]  And you're supposed to be using energy and adrenaline
[09:18.140 --> 09:19.700]  and that anger that you feel,
[09:19.700 --> 09:22.300]  you wouldn't feel that if you were throwing a spear
[09:22.300 --> 09:24.400]  at another animal so that you could survive.
[09:24.740 --> 09:25.920]  You wouldn't have time to be angry.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.680]  You wouldn't have time to be depressed.
[09:27.680 --> 09:30.340]  It'd be letting out all that anger through adrenaline,
[09:30.340 --> 09:32.880]  through hiking, through stalking an animal,
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.920]  or maybe through gardening.
[09:33.920 --> 09:36.960]  If you were a vegetarian back in the whatever times
[09:36.960 --> 09:39.580]  I'm talking about, maybe you had to spend all of that energy
[09:39.580 --> 09:41.920]  in the garden and we're not doing that shit anymore.
[09:41.920 --> 09:44.880]  We're sitting on computers and we're playing video games
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.880]  and we're driving up to a window to get our food.
[09:47.880 --> 09:51.300]  I think a lot of that is kind of what's causing
[09:51.300 --> 09:53.440]  the winter depression for a lot of the males.
[09:53.440 --> 09:55.480]  I'm not sure if this affects women the same way.
[09:55.480 --> 09:56.480]  I'm not trying to be sexist.
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.680]  I just know it's a testosterone thing.
[09:58.680 --> 10:00.800]  Maybe women want to be hunters and gatherers also.
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.280]  Maybe women suffer the seasonal effectiveness disorder
[10:04.280 --> 10:06.400]  for the same reasons, but differently.
[10:06.400 --> 10:07.960]  I'm not sure this part is my opinion.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.780]  The panic attacks and the hunting rant
[10:09.780 --> 10:12.560]  is all my own opinion here.
[10:12.560 --> 10:14.860]  But I think we should be using our energy.
[10:14.860 --> 10:16.940]  And I'm gonna start talking about now about things
[10:16.940 --> 10:19.000]  that we can do to help ourselves
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.100]  with this seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[10:22.100 --> 10:24.740]  I already talked about being active.
[10:24.740 --> 10:27.060]  Exercise, get out there and do something.
[10:27.060 --> 10:29.860]  I'm hypothetically saying I feel like we should be hunting.
[10:29.860 --> 10:32.180]  We should be chasing down an elk or a deer.
[10:32.180 --> 10:34.340]  And then we gotta kill it with either a spear
[10:34.340 --> 10:36.660]  or a bow and arrow, a recurve bow.
[10:36.660 --> 10:38.420]  And you gotta go drag that shit back to camp.
[10:38.420 --> 10:39.300]  And then you gotta skin it.
[10:39.300 --> 10:40.580]  You gotta get everything out.
[10:40.580 --> 10:41.820]  Then fire.
[10:41.820 --> 10:44.500]  I think being around a fire makes me feel really good.
[10:44.500 --> 10:46.900]  Like a campfire, something inside of a campfire
[10:46.900 --> 10:49.620]  really fixes me, especially in this cold weather.
[10:49.620 --> 10:52.580]  So get out there and be active.
[10:52.580 --> 10:54.940]  Build a campfire, go camping.
[10:54.940 --> 10:57.460]  Go hunting if you're that type of person.
[10:57.460 --> 10:58.300]  Be physical.
[10:58.300 --> 11:00.580]  Something I can really recommend to get you out
[11:00.580 --> 11:03.980]  of a seasonal effective disorder kind of a funk
[11:03.980 --> 11:08.100]  is join some sort of organized martial art or fighting.
[11:08.100 --> 11:09.640]  Be physical, use your body.
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.260]  I think a lot of what's causing this
[11:11.260 --> 11:13.980]  is pent up body energy from the winter.
[11:13.980 --> 11:16.420]  So get out there and use your body.
[11:16.420 --> 11:18.300]  Go join a Brazilian jujitsu class.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.580]  Go join a martial arts class.
[11:20.420 --> 11:21.260]  Go be a wrestler.
[11:21.260 --> 11:22.700]  If you're not into that, go do some yoga.
[11:22.700 --> 11:25.200]  Just use your body, use some energy.
[11:25.200 --> 11:27.380]  I think it'll really help you out.
[11:27.380 --> 11:29.420]  So now let's start talking about,
[11:29.420 --> 11:30.820]  before I get to smoking cannabis,
[11:30.820 --> 11:32.140]  I wanna say go for a drive.
[11:32.140 --> 11:33.780]  Just put on some music and go for a drive.
[11:33.780 --> 11:36.900]  That always fixes my head when I'm a little bit funky.
[11:36.900 --> 11:39.020]  Put on your favorite music, some reggae,
[11:39.020 --> 11:39.860]  whatever you're into.
[11:39.860 --> 11:41.220]  If you're into some metal, put on some metal.
[11:41.220 --> 11:43.260]  Turn it up a little bit too loud and just go for a drive.
[11:43.260 --> 11:44.100]  That'll fix your head.
[11:44.100 --> 11:45.080]  But I wanted to say go for a drive
[11:45.080 --> 11:46.860]  before I start talking about consuming cannabis
[11:46.860 --> 11:48.820]  because Mike will flip out if I say smoke a joint,
[11:48.820 --> 11:51.020]  go for a drive, it'll make you feel better.
[11:51.020 --> 11:53.260]  So now let's talk about other things.
[11:53.260 --> 11:56.260]  Cannabis, this is how cannabis can truly help
[11:56.260 --> 11:59.600]  with the seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[11:59.600 --> 12:02.940]  I think that smoking sativa-dominant cannabis,
[12:02.940 --> 12:06.900]  either flowers or dabs, are going to help fix your mood.
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.660]  I've got a short list of strains here
[12:08.660 --> 12:10.660]  that I have experimented with personally
[12:10.660 --> 12:13.020]  that I have found to help uplift my mood
[12:13.020 --> 12:15.220]  and not make me too anxious or jittery
[12:15.220 --> 12:18.580]  and still allow me to function and get my job done
[12:19.340 --> 12:21.420]  like a normal person would still have a nice buzz
[12:21.420 --> 12:23.460]  and nobody could tell how high I am.
[12:23.460 --> 12:27.620]  So on this list, number one on this list is Jilly Bean.
[12:27.620 --> 12:30.500]  Jilly Bean has always put me in a good mood.
[12:30.500 --> 12:31.940]  It's uplifting, it makes me walk
[12:31.940 --> 12:33.260]  with a nice little pep in my step.
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.820]  It puts a grin on my face.
[12:34.820 --> 12:37.980]  Jilly Bean will wipe out any anxiety, depression.
[12:37.980 --> 12:40.140]  It'll calm me down and put you in a good mood.
[12:40.140 --> 12:42.140]  The next one on that list is Tangy.
[12:42.140 --> 12:43.220]  Yes, a lot of people are gonna say
[12:43.220 --> 12:45.240]  Jilly Bean and Tangy are the same thing.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.640]  They're very similar strains.
[12:46.640 --> 12:48.100]  They have very similar qualities.
[12:48.620 --> 12:50.020]  They taste very similarly.
[12:50.020 --> 12:51.140]  They grow similarly.
[12:51.140 --> 12:54.060]  I think they both put a smile on my face.
[12:54.060 --> 12:57.500]  The next strain on my list is Tangerine Haze from Soma.
[12:57.500 --> 13:00.220]  This is actually Soma's New York City Diesel,
[13:00.220 --> 13:02.340]  but there's a phenotype that tastes
[13:02.340 --> 13:04.940]  very tangerine and orangey.
[13:04.940 --> 13:07.740]  That Tangerine Haze has always been,
[13:07.740 --> 13:09.440]  I used to call it my morning breakfast smoke.
[13:09.440 --> 13:10.900]  I'd be like, I need my morning oranges
[13:10.900 --> 13:12.820]  and I would smoke some Soma's Tangerine Haze
[13:12.820 --> 13:15.220]  or his New York City Diesel known as Tangerine Haze.
[13:15.220 --> 13:17.100]  So there's a group back in the day
[13:17.100 --> 13:19.780]  known as the Devil's Harvest Crew.
[13:19.780 --> 13:20.940]  They grew a bunch of stuff
[13:20.940 --> 13:24.220]  and they found a very orangey phenotype,
[13:24.220 --> 13:28.180]  very orangey phenotype of the New York City Soma's Diesel.
[13:28.180 --> 13:29.860]  They passed that around and called it Tangerine Haze.
[13:29.860 --> 13:30.740]  That's where it got the name.
[13:30.740 --> 13:32.420]  I found the same phenotype out of a pack
[13:32.420 --> 13:34.260]  and I grew it and I loved it.
[13:34.260 --> 13:35.660]  It always used to put a smile on my face.
[13:35.660 --> 13:38.540]  So I think those top three that I listed
[13:38.540 --> 13:42.380]  are very orangey, very citrusy, very sativa,
[13:42.380 --> 13:43.780]  yet very light strains.
[13:43.780 --> 13:45.220]  When you smoke them, when I smoke them,
[13:45.220 --> 13:46.180]  I don't get super high.
[13:46.180 --> 13:49.020]  I can't get high as fuck off of either of those three strains
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.900]  but I can catch a really killer smiley buzz.
[13:51.900 --> 13:53.920]  So something in that orange terp
[13:53.920 --> 13:56.000]  is really helping you fix your mood.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.380]  The next strain on my list, you guys, is Cindy 99.
[13:59.380 --> 14:01.500]  Shout out to the Brothers Grimm Seed Company.
[14:01.500 --> 14:04.140]  Cindy 99 has always given me a nice,
[14:04.140 --> 14:06.700]  smiley, cerebral, uplifting buzz.
[14:06.700 --> 14:07.860]  It's just a mood changer.
[14:07.860 --> 14:09.100]  It gives you a little shift.
[14:09.100 --> 14:11.300]  I like it, it's easy to grow.
[14:11.300 --> 14:13.120]  I think it's available again in seed form
[14:13.120 --> 14:14.800]  from our friends at Brothers Grimm.
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.260]  You can possibly pick that up at thedankteam.com.
[14:19.320 --> 14:20.840]  Another one that's always uplifting
[14:20.840 --> 14:21.760]  and puts me in a good mood
[14:21.760 --> 14:24.200]  but is sometimes too much for some people.
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.000]  This one may give you a little panicky.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.440]  If you get a little jittery and too much sativa,
[14:28.440 --> 14:29.600]  this may be a little too much
[14:29.600 --> 14:33.320]  but the Jack Herr has always been a good strain for me.
[14:33.320 --> 14:35.680]  It changes my mood, it gives me energy,
[14:35.680 --> 14:38.280]  it keeps me upbeat, and it makes me social
[14:38.280 --> 14:40.640]  but it can drive your head a little crazy.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.240]  If you're somebody that gets too talkative
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.740]  when you smoke too much cannabis,
[14:43.740 --> 14:46.220]  Jack may not be the cross for you.
[14:46.220 --> 14:49.140]  If you need to get social, if you're going somewhere
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.820]  and you're like, I gotta go talk to people,
[14:50.820 --> 14:53.460]  maybe some Jack will be the one for you.
[14:53.460 --> 14:55.380]  Another strain that is always uplifting
[14:55.380 --> 14:56.560]  and puts people in a good mood,
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.220]  and you guys are gonna be surprised that I say this
[14:58.220 --> 14:59.720]  because I've made plenty of jokes about it,
[14:59.720 --> 15:00.940]  but Blue Dream.
[15:00.940 --> 15:02.700]  Blue Dream is always a good strain
[15:02.700 --> 15:05.500]  for putting you in a good mood, for changing your vibe.
[15:06.420 --> 15:07.340]  It's not one of those strains
[15:07.340 --> 15:09.140]  that makes you wanna curl up into a ball
[15:09.140 --> 15:09.960]  when you get too high
[15:09.960 --> 15:12.340]  because I've seen people wanna do that.
[15:12.340 --> 15:15.540]  Blue Dream is, you can't get too high from Blue Dream
[15:15.540 --> 15:17.180]  and it's a nice mellow buzz.
[15:17.180 --> 15:18.460]  That's why I make fun of Blue Dream.
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.860]  I call it stripper weed
[15:19.860 --> 15:21.700]  because that's how high strippers wanna get.
[15:21.700 --> 15:23.860]  Strippers don't wanna get high as fuck like I do.
[15:23.860 --> 15:25.100]  Strippers just wanna get a little buzz
[15:25.100 --> 15:26.180]  and go spin on the pole.
[15:26.180 --> 15:28.380]  I'm just joking, but that's why I call it stripper weed.
[15:28.380 --> 15:30.460]  So basically any kind of a haze cross, you guys.
[15:30.460 --> 15:33.060]  Most of what I've mentioned has a haze in it.
[15:33.060 --> 15:34.880]  Also Jack the Ripper.
[15:34.880 --> 15:36.640]  Jack Herrer and Jack the Ripper
[15:36.640 --> 15:37.880]  have a lot of the same parents.
[15:37.880 --> 15:40.300]  Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack Herrer.
[15:40.300 --> 15:42.060]  I strongly recommend some Jack the Ripper
[15:42.740 --> 15:44.380]  but like I said about the Herrer,
[15:44.380 --> 15:46.100]  it could be a bit much for you, you guys.
[15:46.100 --> 15:48.180]  It could make some people's head spin
[15:48.180 --> 15:50.540]  if you're not an experienced smoker.
[15:50.540 --> 15:53.300]  So if you're trying to beat seasonal effectiveness disorder
[15:53.300 --> 15:56.500]  and you are able to take a strong, heavy sativa dose
[15:56.500 --> 15:58.420]  and you like to get kinda whirlwind high,
[15:58.420 --> 16:00.100]  grab yourself some Jack the Ripper.
[16:00.100 --> 16:02.100]  It's available at a lot of dispensaries.
[16:02.100 --> 16:04.100]  It's a great tasting cannabis.
[16:04.100 --> 16:05.620]  It has a great high to it
[16:05.620 --> 16:07.140]  and it's usually pretty easy to find
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.620]  because Subcool is a very popular breeder.
[16:09.620 --> 16:11.220]  Since we're talking about Subcool,
[16:11.220 --> 16:13.420]  I'm gonna mention Vortex.
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.660]  I used to get some Vortex.
[16:15.660 --> 16:17.180]  It was wax but it was kinda,
[16:17.180 --> 16:18.740]  it was a different texture of wax
[16:18.740 --> 16:20.380]  from a dispensary in Denver
[16:20.380 --> 16:22.320]  and I loved the high from it.
[16:22.320 --> 16:24.860]  It made me, it gave me tunnel vision high
[16:24.860 --> 16:26.500]  to where I couldn't pay attention to anything
[16:26.500 --> 16:28.420]  except what was right in front of me
[16:28.420 --> 16:31.700]  but it also put the stupidest smile on my face.
[16:31.700 --> 16:34.340]  I really loved the way that Vortex made me feel.
[16:34.340 --> 16:36.900]  Again, Vortex, if you are not an experienced,
[16:36.900 --> 16:39.060]  Vortex made my heart race.
[16:39.060 --> 16:39.900]  It made, you could,
[16:40.460 --> 16:42.420]  my heart was going but I love it.
[16:42.420 --> 16:44.340]  There's something about being too high like that
[16:44.340 --> 16:45.960]  that I really, really enjoy.
[16:46.820 --> 16:48.700]  Another strain that is good
[16:48.700 --> 16:50.820]  for the seasonal affective disorder
[16:50.820 --> 16:52.100]  is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[16:52.100 --> 16:53.680]  That's a Golden Goat cross two.
[16:53.680 --> 16:55.780]  It's actually Lemon Skunk cross to Golden Goat.
[16:55.780 --> 16:56.900]  I bred that one.
[16:56.900 --> 16:59.100]  It is one of my favorites to smoke.
[16:59.100 --> 17:02.700]  It has been tested in the 30% range for THC.
[17:02.700 --> 17:04.340]  It is definitely a head changer.
[17:04.340 --> 17:06.540]  Something about the orange and lemon turps,
[17:06.540 --> 17:09.460]  the limonene turps really create like a good mood,
[17:09.500 --> 17:10.580]  a good vibe.
[17:10.580 --> 17:13.180]  So I think things that smell like oranges,
[17:13.180 --> 17:15.060]  smell like fruit, smell like lemons
[17:15.060 --> 17:17.260]  are usually going to be uplifting,
[17:17.260 --> 17:19.300]  positive vibe kind of strains.
[17:19.300 --> 17:21.100]  I think most of the Haze crosses
[17:21.100 --> 17:22.900]  and the Tangy and Jilly Bean crosses
[17:22.900 --> 17:24.620]  are usually going to be good
[17:24.620 --> 17:27.180]  to put you into a good mood.
[17:27.180 --> 17:29.700]  So those are strains that I can recommend for smoking
[17:29.700 --> 17:31.500]  if they are available where you are.
[17:33.140 --> 17:35.080]  If smoking isn't something for you
[17:35.080 --> 17:38.160]  and if you're not getting the desired affect from smoking,
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.720]  edibles may be a better route to go.
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.240]  Body chemistry is all different.
[17:42.240 --> 17:44.000]  So if you're trying to fight depression
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  or seasonal affective depression,
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.520]  maybe you need high THC.
[17:48.520 --> 17:50.280]  Maybe you need CBD.
[17:50.280 --> 17:52.640]  I would kind of stay away from the Indicas.
[17:52.640 --> 17:54.020]  What happens to me,
[17:55.240 --> 17:57.060]  and I have to go in history
[17:57.060 --> 17:58.360]  because now I smoke so much
[17:58.360 --> 18:00.200]  and my tolerance is so high and I'm older
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.160]  and I'm more used to being high out of my mind.
[18:03.160 --> 18:05.440]  When I was younger and was new at cannabis,
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.960]  when I would smoke sativas,
[18:06.960 --> 18:08.680]  I would get that real psychedelic high
[18:08.680 --> 18:10.160]  and get talkative sort of like I am now.
[18:10.160 --> 18:12.280]  I'm just fucking rambling and talking about everything.
[18:12.280 --> 18:14.080]  But then when I would smoke Indicas,
[18:14.080 --> 18:16.400]  I would go in my head and get quiet.
[18:16.400 --> 18:17.600]  And that's when you just sit in a chair
[18:17.600 --> 18:18.800]  and you start thinking too much.
[18:18.800 --> 18:20.080]  And I would kind of,
[18:20.080 --> 18:22.520]  sometimes you could drive yourself crazy thinking too much.
[18:22.520 --> 18:23.360]  And when you're already
[18:23.360 --> 18:26.800]  in the seasonal effectiveness disorder kind of head state,
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.320]  smoking an Indica that's going to put you into your own head
[18:29.320 --> 18:30.740]  and make you think may fuck you up
[18:30.740 --> 18:31.760]  a little more than you need.
[18:31.760 --> 18:32.920]  It may cause more depression.
[18:32.920 --> 18:34.420]  It may cause self doubt.
[18:34.420 --> 18:36.260]  It may cause confusion.
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.780]  It may not be the thing that you need.
[18:37.780 --> 18:42.180]  So I would go for some sativa edibles or CBD edibles,
[18:42.180 --> 18:43.740]  but I would definitely stay away
[18:43.740 --> 18:46.980]  from the Indica dominant stuff.
[18:46.980 --> 18:49.400]  You guys, I think the most reliable cure
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.300]  for seasonal effective disorder
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.920]  is to smoke a joint and go for a hike.
[18:53.920 --> 18:55.740]  Find a nice safe hiking spot,
[18:55.740 --> 18:58.500]  roll yourself up a nice joint of your favorite strain,
[18:58.500 --> 19:00.860]  either the Jilly Bean or some Lemon Jeffrey
[19:00.860 --> 19:02.780]  or whatever you can find that fits in the list
[19:02.780 --> 19:04.060]  that I talked about.
[19:04.060 --> 19:06.060]  Get yourself a nice sativa joint,
[19:06.860 --> 19:08.740]  roll it up, take one of your best friends with you,
[19:08.740 --> 19:11.420]  take your dog with you, get a bottle of water,
[19:11.420 --> 19:14.980]  go for a walk, smoke a joint and fix your head.
[19:14.980 --> 19:16.960]  And keep in mind, you guys, it's okay to feel this way.
[19:16.960 --> 19:18.820]  Everybody's going to deal with some shit in their life.
[19:18.820 --> 19:20.900]  It's all right to feel kind of funky once in a while.
[19:20.900 --> 19:22.180]  Just don't be a dick.
[19:22.180 --> 19:24.940]  Try to deal with it properly and pull yourself through it.
[19:24.940 --> 19:25.980]  Hopefully when the spring comes,
[19:25.980 --> 19:27.540]  he'll start cheering up again.
[19:27.540 --> 19:29.300]  Hopefully by the time 420 rolls around,
[19:29.300 --> 19:31.180]  you'll be in a good mood and then summer's coming back
[19:31.180 --> 19:33.060]  and then it's time to get in a good mood again.
[19:33.060 --> 19:34.100]  Hopefully you can figure it out
[19:34.100 --> 19:35.980]  and not go through it again next year.
[19:36.780 --> 19:37.620]  All right, you guys, that was my quick talk
[19:37.620 --> 19:40.260]  on seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[19:40.260 --> 19:41.380]  I hope I was helpful.
[19:41.380 --> 19:42.660]  I hope I could guide you in the right way
[19:42.660 --> 19:44.780]  to select cannabis to keep you in a good mood.
[19:44.780 --> 19:46.000]  Hey, even if you're not suffering
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.480]  through some seasonal depression,
[19:47.480 --> 19:49.640]  all of these strains will probably put a smile on your face,
[19:49.640 --> 19:51.020]  keep you social.
[19:51.020 --> 19:52.180]  If you have to go to lunch with somebody
[19:52.180 --> 19:53.580]  you don't really care to go to lunch with,
[19:53.580 --> 19:54.500]  if you've got to do a chore
[19:54.500 --> 19:56.020]  you don't really give a shit to do,
[19:56.020 --> 19:57.260]  try smoking one of these strains.
[19:57.260 --> 19:59.720]  It just might put you in a better mood for doing it.
[19:59.720 --> 20:00.840]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody
[20:00.840 --> 20:02.340]  for listening to a short podcast.
