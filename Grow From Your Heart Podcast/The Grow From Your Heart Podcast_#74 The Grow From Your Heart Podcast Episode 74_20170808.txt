[00:17.660 --> 00:20.060]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.060 --> 00:23.700]  It's time for episode number 73, 73, 74.
[00:23.700 --> 00:25.180]  I don't know, it might be 74
[00:25.180 --> 00:26.400]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:26.400 --> 00:29.980]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:29.980 --> 00:32.220]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:32.220 --> 00:34.140]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:34.140 --> 00:35.380]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:35.380 --> 00:36.780]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:36.780 --> 00:38.220]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:38.220 --> 00:40.820]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.820 --> 00:41.700]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.700 --> 00:42.620]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:42.620 --> 00:43.860]  Sitting across the table from me
[00:43.860 --> 00:44.940]  is my good buddy, White Mike.
[00:44.940 --> 00:45.780]  How you doing, bro?
[00:45.780 --> 00:46.620]  I'm doing good.
[00:46.620 --> 00:47.440]  How you doing, buddy?
[00:47.440 --> 00:48.280]  I'm doing great.
[00:48.280 --> 00:49.640]  Dude, I wanna give you a big personal thank you
[00:49.640 --> 00:51.240]  before we start the show.
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.440]  My car has been broke down, like you guys all know,
[00:53.440 --> 00:56.440]  and Mike was kind enough to run my errands for me today,
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.880]  and he actually stopped at the donut shop on the way home.
[00:59.880 --> 01:02.240]  So we're all hopped up on donuts and caffeine right now.
[01:02.240 --> 01:03.120]  It's gonna be a great show.
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.280]  Thanks, dude, for hooking me up with a ride lately.
[01:05.280 --> 01:06.960]  Happy to, man.
[01:06.960 --> 01:08.060]  Also, while we're giving thanks,
[01:08.060 --> 01:10.120]  I gotta give a thanks to the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.800]  That song that I cut off abruptly there
[01:11.800 --> 01:13.680]  was the doggy dub from the Mystic Roots
[01:13.680 --> 01:15.440]  off their album, The Constant Struggle.
[01:15.440 --> 01:18.000]  Shout out to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.760]  I like that they let me play their music on the show.
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.800]  That is really super kind of them.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.760]  I also, oh, a shout out to my buddy, Deez.
[01:24.760 --> 01:26.560]  He's working on a new intro song for me,
[01:26.560 --> 01:28.760]  so big thanks to Deez.
[01:28.760 --> 01:30.680]  Mike and I were talking, we were kind of hanging out.
[01:30.680 --> 01:32.320]  We didn't have anything to do on a Saturday night
[01:32.320 --> 01:33.920]  because we're a couple of bums,
[01:33.920 --> 01:35.800]  and we're like, why don't we do something productive
[01:35.800 --> 01:37.720]  and record a podcast?
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.040]  Put some time to good use.
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.600]  Yeah, you know, put our time to use.
[01:40.600 --> 01:41.440]  That's right.
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.280]  Put our sugar to good use, at least.
[01:42.280 --> 01:43.120]  Brr.
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.640]  I'm gonna be bouncing off the walls here.
[01:44.640 --> 01:45.560]  Thank you, Amy.
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.720]  Yeah, thanks, Amy's Donuts.
[01:46.720 --> 01:48.320]  Shout out to Amy's Donuts in Pueblo.
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.440]  And whoever was the one sad, lonely guy working the night.
[01:53.720 --> 01:54.840]  Glad to make you laugh, bro.
[01:54.840 --> 01:55.840]  Thanks for the sugar.
[01:55.840 --> 01:57.480]  We weren't gonna stop and get donuts,
[01:57.480 --> 01:59.560]  but as we drove by, we could see into the building
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.440]  that there was just one dude standing there
[02:01.440 --> 02:03.760]  staring out the window, watching traffic,
[02:03.760 --> 02:06.280]  and I predicted that if we waited four hours without going,
[02:06.280 --> 02:09.280]  he may kill himself standing there staring out the window.
[02:09.280 --> 02:11.760]  He looked so sad and lonely.
[02:11.760 --> 02:13.360]  We just had to go cheer him up.
[02:13.360 --> 02:15.720]  I bought some donuts and Mike gave the dude a fat tip.
[02:15.720 --> 02:16.560]  Yep.
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.960]  That was nice of you.
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.800]  Well.
[02:18.800 --> 02:19.640]  Fat for Pueblo.
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.480]  Yeah, it was a donut tip.
[02:20.480 --> 02:21.640]  I mean, it's supposed to feel the guy
[02:21.640 --> 02:22.480]  told you everything. When I handed it to him,
[02:22.480 --> 02:23.600]  it was kinda clear that he did not expect
[02:23.600 --> 02:25.160]  to get tipped on this shift.
[02:25.160 --> 02:26.720]  Well, then now he's got money
[02:26.720 --> 02:28.200]  for whatever he does after work.
[02:28.200 --> 02:30.160]  He's at least got a story to tell at the end of the day.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.320]  So these two super high guys came through
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.880]  and bought a lot of donuts.
[02:33.880 --> 02:35.720]  Part of the directions were to fill the box
[02:35.720 --> 02:37.440]  with something quote, colorful.
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.280]  That's what I said.
[02:38.280 --> 02:40.000]  I was like, I want one of these specific donuts
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.440]  because they're tasty as fuck.
[02:41.440 --> 02:44.280]  And then after that, just put colorful shit in the box.
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.040]  And he met that goal.
[02:46.040 --> 02:48.440]  We're looking forward to eating the lime green
[02:48.440 --> 02:50.040]  and possibly apple flavored one later.
[02:50.040 --> 02:51.320]  I don't know what that is.
[02:51.320 --> 02:53.000]  A couple of them got marshmallow on there.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.280]  I really try to stay away from the marshmallow products,
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.800]  but you know, he didn't know that.
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.680]  Like I said, I've had a lot of sugar.
[02:58.680 --> 02:59.840]  Yeah.
[02:59.840 --> 03:01.080]  We've been talking about donuts
[03:01.080 --> 03:02.280]  for almost three minutes now.
[03:02.280 --> 03:04.960]  So there are no ads on this show.
[03:04.960 --> 03:06.160]  We are gonna read some news.
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.040]  The other day I told Mike, he was talking about news.
[03:08.040 --> 03:10.240]  He's like, I tweeted you some good news.
[03:10.280 --> 03:13.960]  And no, not necessarily good news, good news articles.
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.360]  That's not all good news, but he tweeted that shit to me.
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.560]  And he's like, you can go ahead and use that on the show.
[03:19.560 --> 03:21.480]  And I was like, dude, why don't you go ahead
[03:21.480 --> 03:22.800]  and be like my news guy?
[03:22.800 --> 03:24.800]  Why don't you send me all the news about cannabis
[03:24.800 --> 03:26.040]  that you can find?
[03:26.040 --> 03:28.600]  And that way I can work on the grow lessons
[03:28.600 --> 03:30.440]  and we can get Mike doing a lot of news for us.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.080]  I still have to read all the news and review it,
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.560]  but Mike's searching out the news a little more for me.
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.400]  So shout out to Mike.
[03:35.400 --> 03:37.440]  He's gonna keep doing that for us.
[03:37.440 --> 03:38.280]  Happy to man.
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.120]  I hope.
[03:39.120 --> 03:39.940]  Gotta keep the people informed.
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.660]  Yeah, that's what we're here for.
[03:41.660 --> 03:45.100]  I don't have time to do this show's news,
[03:45.100 --> 03:48.700]  the grow, the spot, my grow.
[03:48.700 --> 03:49.860]  Focus on what you do best, buddy.
[03:49.860 --> 03:50.940]  Everybody's got their wheelhouse.
[03:50.940 --> 03:53.460]  So having you do some news is fully part of mine.
[03:53.460 --> 03:54.980]  It's definitely gonna make it a little bit
[03:54.980 --> 03:55.820]  of an improvement.
[03:55.820 --> 03:57.660]  Guys, if you get bored of the news shows, I apologize,
[03:57.660 --> 03:59.520]  but I think it's just as important
[03:59.520 --> 04:02.340]  as the lessons and things.
[04:02.340 --> 04:03.300]  And tweet at both of us.
[04:03.300 --> 04:04.860]  Tell us you want more or less.
[04:04.860 --> 04:06.620]  And if you find a news article you want me to read,
[04:06.620 --> 04:07.460]  you can tweet it to me.
[04:07.900 --> 04:10.020]  It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[04:10.020 --> 04:11.540]  Anyway, let's find one of these news articles
[04:11.540 --> 04:12.360]  we were talking about.
[04:12.360 --> 04:13.580]  You ready for this, dude?
[04:13.580 --> 04:14.420]  Yep.
[04:14.420 --> 04:17.860]  Let's start with Florida.
[04:17.860 --> 04:18.780]  Oh, Florida.
[04:18.780 --> 04:19.940]  What have you done now?
[04:19.940 --> 04:21.540]  Well, it's usually some fucked up shit
[04:21.540 --> 04:22.540]  we hear about from Florida,
[04:22.540 --> 04:24.380]  but this one doesn't involve a goat.
[04:24.380 --> 04:25.780]  It does not involve a chainsaw.
[04:25.780 --> 04:26.620]  No face eating.
[04:26.620 --> 04:27.460]  No bath salts.
[04:27.460 --> 04:28.540]  That's where I was headed.
[04:28.540 --> 04:30.420]  So this is actually.
[04:30.420 --> 04:32.380]  This is a step in the right direction for Florida.
[04:32.380 --> 04:33.860]  Yes, Florida is going the right way.
[04:33.860 --> 04:36.080]  Of course, I've got a giant ad on my screen
[04:36.080 --> 04:36.980]  right in the way here.
[04:37.500 --> 04:38.340]  Where did that article go?
[04:38.340 --> 04:39.700]  I'm going to have to refresh
[04:39.700 --> 04:43.060]  because this website I'm using is filled with ads
[04:43.060 --> 04:45.580]  that I cannot find the article under.
[04:45.580 --> 04:46.680]  All right, there's actually some good news
[04:46.680 --> 04:47.760]  coming out of Florida this time.
[04:47.760 --> 04:49.500]  I'm scrolling to the article right now.
[04:49.500 --> 04:52.340]  And the headline is Florida low THC,
[04:52.340 --> 04:55.900]  medical marijuana law passes major hurdle.
[04:55.900 --> 04:57.340]  I'm sure you guys kind of know where this is headed.
[04:57.340 --> 05:01.340]  And it says, this is actually from the firstcoastnews.com.
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.500]  I got to give them credit.
[05:02.500 --> 05:04.460]  And it says, we've shared their emotional stories.
[05:04.460 --> 05:06.500]  Parents from all over the state have been waiting,
[05:06.500 --> 05:08.420]  waiting to get their hands on Charlotte's Web,
[05:08.420 --> 05:11.020]  a low THC form of medical marijuana
[05:11.020 --> 05:12.720]  to treat illnesses their children have,
[05:12.720 --> 05:16.060]  such as epilepsy, seizures, and cancer.
[05:16.060 --> 05:17.740]  And it says, from Tallahassee, Florida,
[05:17.740 --> 05:19.180]  we've shared their emotional stories.
[05:19.180 --> 05:21.440]  Parents from all over the state have been waiting,
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.220]  waiting to get their hands on Charlotte's Web,
[05:23.220 --> 05:25.100]  a low THC form of medical marijuana
[05:25.100 --> 05:27.100]  to treat illnesses in their children,
[05:27.100 --> 05:29.580]  such as epilepsy, seizures, and cancer.
[05:29.580 --> 05:31.220]  And now finally, on Wednesday,
[05:31.220 --> 05:33.860]  they got an answer when a judge threw out a lawsuit
[05:33.860 --> 05:36.740]  holding up the implementation of the drug.
[05:36.740 --> 05:38.180]  Jeff Sharkey started
[05:38.180 --> 05:40.500]  the Medical Marijuana Business Association.
[05:40.500 --> 05:42.820]  He's followed the entire process of Charlotte's Web,
[05:42.820 --> 05:44.960]  from lawmakers legalizing it last year,
[05:44.960 --> 05:47.180]  to several lawsuits from potential growers
[05:47.180 --> 05:48.420]  halting the sale of the drug,
[05:48.420 --> 05:51.820]  to today with a sale date in sight.
[05:51.820 --> 05:54.860]  The rule that was finally approved was fair and balanced,
[05:54.860 --> 05:55.940]  Sharkey said.
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.420]  It's been a long discussion and dialogue.
[05:58.420 --> 06:00.100]  It's been a long discussion and dialogue,
[06:00.100 --> 06:02.220]  and I know there's been some frustration with it,
[06:02.220 --> 06:07.220]  but here we are with a rule that's going into effect.
[06:08.180 --> 06:10.460]  Sorry, guys, I'm trying to cough and read at the same time.
[06:10.460 --> 06:12.060]  We'll have people submitting applications
[06:12.060 --> 06:13.020]  to become dispensaries,
[06:13.020 --> 06:15.220]  and I think Florida is ready for this.
[06:15.220 --> 06:17.220]  Florida's Department of Health has been the agency
[06:17.220 --> 06:19.380]  in charge of implementing Charlotte's Web.
[06:19.380 --> 06:22.340]  They're expected to take applications
[06:22.340 --> 06:24.800]  from eligible growers within three weeks.
[06:24.800 --> 06:28.860]  Under the law, only five will be chosen to sell it.
[06:28.860 --> 06:30.300]  So pretty soon in Florida,
[06:30.300 --> 06:32.260]  there will be five dispensaries
[06:32.260 --> 06:34.440]  selling Charlotte's Web medicine.
[06:35.660 --> 06:36.820]  I have mixed emotions about this.
[06:36.820 --> 06:37.660]  How about you, Mike?
[06:37.660 --> 06:39.060]  You look like you got shit to say already.
[06:39.060 --> 06:41.180]  It's, I mean, I feel a little bad
[06:41.180 --> 06:43.240]  because I didn't follow this story as closely
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.200]  as I follow most cannabis news,
[06:45.200 --> 06:47.940]  because it's another Charlotte's Web state law.
[06:47.940 --> 06:52.340]  And while any progress towards medical marijuana access
[06:52.340 --> 06:53.660]  is huge and awesome,
[06:53.660 --> 06:57.740]  and it's another big win for reality and science,
[06:57.740 --> 07:00.900]  CBD only is silly and just a,
[07:00.900 --> 07:04.780]  it's a half step that no one needs to take at this point.
[07:04.780 --> 07:07.940]  California has been medical since 1996.
[07:07.940 --> 07:10.180]  All of this CBD stuff in Charlotte's Web
[07:10.180 --> 07:12.620]  came out of our medical marijuana system here.
[07:13.580 --> 07:15.540]  THC is fantastic medicine.
[07:15.540 --> 07:18.620]  And thanks to the vote last year in Florida,
[07:18.620 --> 07:21.300]  they've got CBD only now, thanks to this law,
[07:21.300 --> 07:23.340]  but it's only Charlotte's Web specific.
[07:23.340 --> 07:26.140]  It's the only strain they can sell and grow.
[07:26.140 --> 07:29.100]  Realm of Caring did an amazing job trademarking
[07:29.100 --> 07:31.780]  and getting their name out and pitching it as safe
[07:31.780 --> 07:34.240]  and not intoxicating.
[07:35.260 --> 07:37.060]  Add that and Sanjay Gupta together
[07:37.060 --> 07:39.660]  and we've got 13 CBD only states.
[07:39.660 --> 07:41.660]  Now, I know I said I had mixed emotions.
[07:42.540 --> 07:44.420]  One of my opinions is like you said,
[07:44.420 --> 07:47.340]  it's great that we have medical marijuana in Florida now
[07:47.340 --> 07:49.340]  so that these kids can get their medicine
[07:49.340 --> 07:52.000]  and the parents don't have to watch their children suffer
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.580]  and the kids can live a happy, normal life.
[07:54.620 --> 07:58.660]  But I don't think that CBD only medicine is the way to go.
[07:58.660 --> 08:00.180]  And also like you're saying,
[08:00.180 --> 08:02.660]  this one company that owns the Charlotte's Web
[08:02.660 --> 08:05.220]  is going to make money off of this like crazy.
[08:05.220 --> 08:07.620]  And that's not a cool way to go about medical cannabis.
[08:07.620 --> 08:09.420]  Well, I mean, if you really think about it,
[08:09.420 --> 08:11.480]  the article talks about the kids,
[08:11.480 --> 08:13.800]  but it's not just children in Florida
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.080]  that would be accessing Charlotte's Web medications
[08:17.080 --> 08:19.340]  through these five dispensaries.
[08:19.340 --> 08:21.980]  There's all the adult patients
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.400]  with all of those conditions as well.
[08:23.400 --> 08:26.200]  So you're talking about a huge number of people,
[08:26.200 --> 08:30.800]  five business or five store locations, one product brand.
[08:32.560 --> 08:33.380]  I mean-
[08:33.380 --> 08:34.220]  Are we gonna run out?
[08:34.220 --> 08:35.060]  Oh, for sure.
[08:35.060 --> 08:36.760]  There's gonna be huge product limitations
[08:36.760 --> 08:40.540]  and it's gonna be like two ridiculous costs per gram
[08:40.540 --> 08:42.160]  like it is out here.
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.880]  I don't know the price off the top of my head.
[08:43.880 --> 08:45.140]  I almost threw out a random number,
[08:45.140 --> 08:48.700]  but I don't wanna do that because it's ridiculously high,
[08:48.700 --> 08:51.640]  but I don't wanna be wrong about how ridiculously high.
[08:51.640 --> 08:52.840]  Okay.
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.840]  I'll let you live with that answer.
[08:54.840 --> 08:58.040]  Yeah, it's so, there's something that Mike said
[08:58.040 --> 08:59.600]  that the THC is good medicine.
[08:59.600 --> 09:01.560]  There's something I feel about,
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.680]  we used to call it the entourage effect in Colorado.
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.320]  Now the industry term has moved to the synergistic effect.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.720]  And that's the effect of the cannabinoids,
[09:09.720 --> 09:13.320]  the paleates, the terpenoids, the flavonoids,
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.640]  and the esters all working together
[09:15.640 --> 09:18.100]  to provide you a medicinal benefit.
[09:18.100 --> 09:20.680]  And just by isolating the CBD,
[09:20.680 --> 09:23.080]  I don't think you're getting the full benefit
[09:23.080 --> 09:25.140]  of the medicinal cannabis.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.880]  And you're gonna say it works with the kids
[09:26.880 --> 09:27.920]  and the kids don't have seizures.
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.520]  Yeah, but for me, CBD medicine doesn't do anything
[09:31.520 --> 09:34.920]  for my medical condition that I smoke for.
[09:34.920 --> 09:36.160]  It works great for me,
[09:36.160 --> 09:38.400]  but it doesn't do everything I need it to.
[09:38.400 --> 09:41.000]  I need the THC half of that puzzle as well.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.120]  Yeah, yeah, Mike.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.360]  We see this with the,
[09:43.360 --> 09:46.680]  there's been a 100% THC pill called Marinol
[09:46.680 --> 09:48.540]  on the market for decades.
[09:48.540 --> 09:49.600]  No one likes it because-
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.080]  Nobody likes it.
[09:51.080 --> 09:53.640]  It doesn't have the rest of the cannabinoids in it.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.480]  And they tried Sativa X.
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.320]  You need that balance.
[09:55.320 --> 09:56.140]  They tried Sativa X.
[09:56.140 --> 09:56.980]  Sativa X, yeah.
[09:56.980 --> 09:59.760]  Sativa X, I just called it Sativa X, you know, Sativa X.
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.400]  There's one company in Europe
[10:01.400 --> 10:03.560]  that's doing a whole plant extract
[10:03.560 --> 10:07.840]  where they're taking the whole raw marijuana plant
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.880]  and making some sort of, I think it's a sublingual spray,
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.560]  a spray under your tongue like Banaca.
[10:13.560 --> 10:14.840]  Nice.
[10:14.840 --> 10:17.560]  And they were testing it for MS the last I read.
[10:17.560 --> 10:19.080]  So there are companies looking
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.340]  at whole marijuana plant extract
[10:21.340 --> 10:23.920]  rather than isolating one or two components.
[10:23.920 --> 10:26.000]  Does your friend Dave listen to the podcast?
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.720]  I have no idea he should.
[10:27.720 --> 10:28.760]  Well, if you do, bro, shout out.
[10:28.760 --> 10:30.400]  I thought of you when he said that we've got a friend
[10:30.400 --> 10:32.360]  that could benefit from this sublingual spray.
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.180]  For sure.
[10:33.180 --> 10:34.020]  Did I say that right?
[10:34.020 --> 10:34.840]  Sublingual?
[10:34.840 --> 10:35.680]  Yep.
[10:35.680 --> 10:36.520]  Nice.
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.660]  I just spat that one out.
[10:37.660 --> 10:39.640]  Yeah, so this is gonna work for a lot of people,
[10:39.640 --> 10:41.480]  but I'm a medical smoker
[10:41.480 --> 10:46.200]  and I definitely need my THC heavy Sativas.
[10:46.200 --> 10:49.160]  So shout out for going the right direction, Florida,
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.480]  for trying to do the medical thing.
[10:50.480 --> 10:52.360]  Maybe this will open the door.
[10:52.360 --> 10:55.640]  How long do they have to just go with CBD medicine?
[10:55.640 --> 10:58.560]  This is the end of what they have going for now.
[10:58.560 --> 11:01.440]  I'm sure there's another group working
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.480]  towards getting a legalization on the ballot in Florida,
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.120]  either medical or rec again in the next presidential,
[11:07.120 --> 11:07.760]  but so far it's this.
[11:07.760 --> 11:10.440]  I guess we can look at it this way.
[11:10.440 --> 11:11.320]  Gosh, excuse me, guys.
[11:11.320 --> 11:13.320]  I had sugary Dr. Pepper and donuts
[11:13.320 --> 11:16.640]  and my voice is already all fucked up from the show,
[11:16.640 --> 11:18.040]  but we can look at it this way.
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.520]  The sick kids who have seizures and epilepsy and cancer
[11:22.520 --> 11:24.000]  and things like that that need help
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.880]  can now get the CBD medicine.
[11:25.880 --> 11:28.600]  And the people like you and I that are in our 30s
[11:28.600 --> 11:31.280]  that know some people that know some people
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.160]  that aren't, we're able-bodied.
[11:33.160 --> 11:34.760]  We can go out and get some herb.
[11:34.760 --> 11:35.580]  You know what I mean?
[11:35.580 --> 11:36.420]  So that's cool.
[11:36.420 --> 11:37.840]  The kids, those kids needed it way more
[11:37.840 --> 11:39.880]  than the folks that want the Sativas.
[11:39.880 --> 11:42.240]  So I guess it does, it helps a lot still.
[11:42.240 --> 11:44.080]  I'm a big fan, but at the same time,
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.880]  I remember how many epilepsy patients
[11:46.880 --> 11:48.280]  used to come into the shop.
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.480]  I remember, I mean, I remember them enough
[11:52.480 --> 11:55.400]  to have researched some of this stuff after we left
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.560]  and THC is fairly effective on treating seizures.
[11:59.560 --> 12:04.240]  And so having some THC in an anti-seizure medication
[12:04.240 --> 12:08.520]  that's made from cannabis makes a whole lot of sense.
[12:08.520 --> 12:10.520]  In Charlotte's Web specific laws,
[12:10.520 --> 12:12.560]  we didn't end up with Charlotte's Web
[12:12.560 --> 12:15.560]  because it happened, we saw it working great for seizures
[12:15.560 --> 12:17.920]  and dove into that.
[12:17.920 --> 12:22.300]  They found it had no THC and that certain medical patients
[12:22.300 --> 12:25.800]  were looking for a non-intoxicating medication.
[12:25.800 --> 12:26.640]  And it worked for that.
[12:26.640 --> 12:27.920]  And they're afraid to give the THC to the kids.
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.320]  That's the big scary part here.
[12:29.320 --> 12:31.080]  It makes a much better pitch
[12:31.080 --> 12:33.360]  when there's absolutely no THC in there.
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.440]  When you can just say straight up, there's no high to it.
[12:37.440 --> 12:38.820]  You can take as much as you want.
[12:38.820 --> 12:41.140]  There's no intoxicating effect,
[12:41.140 --> 12:45.180]  but an intoxicating effect doesn't mean non-medical effect.
[12:45.180 --> 12:47.660]  It just means also intoxicating.
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.220]  All right, let's get out of Florida.
[12:50.220 --> 12:51.060]  Thanks, Florida.
[12:51.060 --> 12:52.780]  We've done a couple minutes on that news topic.
[12:52.780 --> 12:53.940]  I don't want to bore the folks.
[12:53.940 --> 12:56.220]  CBD was big in the news this week.
[12:56.220 --> 12:59.180]  Yes, CBD is going to remain big in the news,
[12:59.180 --> 13:00.700]  I think for the next little while.
[13:00.700 --> 13:02.520]  What's the next, this is a random question.
[13:02.520 --> 13:04.140]  What's the next cannabinoid to pop up
[13:04.140 --> 13:05.220]  that's going to be popular?
[13:05.220 --> 13:06.620]  I'm hoping it's CBG.
[13:06.620 --> 13:08.180]  That's what I was going to say.
[13:08.580 --> 13:09.580]  Just from what I've seen.
[13:09.580 --> 13:14.580]  I had the good fortune to get a small sample of CBG capsules.
[13:15.900 --> 13:16.740]  Very neat.
[13:16.740 --> 13:18.300]  And it was during a period of time
[13:18.300 --> 13:20.220]  where I had some bad back pain.
[13:20.220 --> 13:22.420]  And oh Lordy, they helped me get through some long shifts.
[13:22.420 --> 13:24.060]  Did those come from within our circle?
[13:24.060 --> 13:24.880]  They did.
[13:24.880 --> 13:25.720]  I had some of those.
[13:25.720 --> 13:28.100]  They made me sleep like a baby.
[13:28.100 --> 13:28.940]  Yeah, that was awesome.
[13:28.940 --> 13:29.760]  Maybe I need some of those.
[13:29.760 --> 13:31.380]  I've been having some sleep issues lately.
[13:31.380 --> 13:34.060]  Been smoking too much Sativa and taking the alpha brain.
[13:34.060 --> 13:35.820]  Yep, one more reason to get caregivers
[13:35.820 --> 13:36.980]  back into the testing labs.
[13:36.980 --> 13:38.480]  I've been talking about this alpha brain.
[13:38.480 --> 13:40.380]  And when I take it too late in the day,
[13:40.380 --> 13:43.180]  it gives me the most craziest dreams.
[13:44.060 --> 13:46.060]  So we just did an article from Florida.
[13:46.060 --> 13:47.900]  Let's jump to our hometown here
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.980]  in the lovely Steel City, Pueblo, Colorado.
[13:51.980 --> 13:53.260]  What's up Pueblo?
[13:54.480 --> 13:55.660]  719.
[13:55.660 --> 13:57.740]  So the headline here is
[13:57.740 --> 14:00.580]  Pueblo County wants to keep excess weed money.
[14:00.580 --> 14:03.560]  This article is by Jeff Tucker from the Pueblo Chieftain.
[14:03.560 --> 14:06.020]  And it says Pueblo County will be asking voters
[14:06.020 --> 14:08.980]  whether they want the equivalent of about three spins
[14:08.980 --> 14:10.900]  of the city park kiddies ride,
[14:10.900 --> 14:13.980]  or if they would rather let the government
[14:13.980 --> 14:16.500]  use a little less than $150,000
[14:16.500 --> 14:19.580]  in excess marijuana revenues for something else.
[14:19.580 --> 14:21.620]  Guys that aren't from Pueblo, that's a local joke.
[14:21.620 --> 14:23.220]  We've got a park here with some kiddie rides.
[14:23.220 --> 14:24.980]  It costs like 50 cents.
[14:24.980 --> 14:27.300]  And they're saying that they're gonna write a check
[14:27.300 --> 14:29.380]  for about three spins on those shitty rides,
[14:29.380 --> 14:32.860]  or if they'd rather let the city just keep the money
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.500]  in the excess marijuana revenues
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.100]  and use it for something else.
[14:36.100 --> 14:38.700]  So it says the Pueblo Board of County Commissioners
[14:38.700 --> 14:42.380]  instructed County Attorney Greg Steidar on Wednesday
[14:42.380 --> 14:44.480]  to start work on a ballot language
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.100]  that will give voters an option
[14:46.100 --> 14:48.300]  on what to do with the marijuana sales tax money
[14:48.300 --> 14:51.060]  they collected in 2014.
[14:51.060 --> 14:52.620]  As part of the exemption,
[14:52.620 --> 14:57.620]  the 3.5% sales tax from the State Taxpayers Bill of Rights,
[14:57.660 --> 14:58.740]  let's make sure I read that right.
[14:58.740 --> 15:02.700]  3.5% sales tax from the State Taxpayers Bill of Rights,
[15:02.700 --> 15:06.820]  the county made an estimated income of $400,000
[15:06.820 --> 15:09.660]  from the marijuana sales tax collection.
[15:09.660 --> 15:11.940]  In the first year of legal recreational sales
[15:11.940 --> 15:16.940]  in Pueblo County, $548,479 was collected from sales tax,
[15:18.300 --> 15:23.300]  meaning that $148,479 is due back to the public
[15:23.980 --> 15:27.860]  unless voters give the county approval to keep it.
[15:27.860 --> 15:29.880]  Do you have an opinion on that?
[15:29.880 --> 15:31.340]  I'll let them keep it.
[15:31.340 --> 15:32.160]  Yeah, let them keep it.
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.960]  Maybe they can fill some of the damn potholes
[15:33.960 --> 15:36.160]  that are all over this city, everywhere.
[15:36.160 --> 15:38.880]  It's funny that you say that the county raked in it
[15:38.880 --> 15:41.280]  a huge amount of money, it was like 1.7 million
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.640]  just in Pueblo County last year from the marijuana industry.
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.160]  Half of that was taxes, half of that was like fees
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.680]  and application fees and things like that.
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.480]  But Pueblo West Metropolitan District
[15:53.480 --> 15:55.200]  whined that all the shops were there
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.940]  but they weren't getting a special cut.
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.760]  So the county commissioners broke them off
[15:58.760 --> 16:00.520]  like two or 300 grand
[16:00.520 --> 16:02.200]  and they're throwing it all onto their streets.
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.600]  It's a great plan.
[16:03.600 --> 16:05.880]  And they need their streets repaired as badly as we do.
[16:05.880 --> 16:07.800]  They made a good argument, the shops are all here,
[16:07.800 --> 16:10.200]  we wanna cut and so the county said, here's your cut
[16:10.200 --> 16:11.920]  and they said, thanks for the road money.
[16:11.920 --> 16:13.800]  Was it an extra shitty winter
[16:13.800 --> 16:15.960]  or are the roads just not getting paid attention to
[16:15.960 --> 16:17.640]  because they've been terrible here lately?
[16:17.640 --> 16:18.480]  Yes.
[16:18.480 --> 16:19.880]  Okay, I thought it was a little bit of both.
[16:19.880 --> 16:23.560]  One of the side of issues I caught down at city council
[16:23.560 --> 16:27.040]  is our roads right now, to get them up to speed
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.120]  at the pace we're doing, just to get the Pueblo stuff
[16:30.720 --> 16:32.240]  in order is gonna take 50 years.
[16:32.240 --> 16:35.000]  That's how bad our infrastructure stuff is right now.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.040]  And that's not just Pueblo, that's all over the nation.
[16:37.040 --> 16:39.760]  That's why bridges are collapsing and trains are crashing.
[16:39.760 --> 16:40.720]  Wow.
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.560]  Yep.
[16:41.560 --> 16:42.380]  Holy crap.
[16:42.380 --> 16:43.400]  Time to invest in infrastructure.
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.040]  I would rather have not heard that.
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.360]  Yep, so one of the big reasons to vote this year,
[16:48.360 --> 16:49.640]  make sure you're registered to vote
[16:49.640 --> 16:52.680]  for this November election is if you're in Colorado,
[16:52.680 --> 16:55.040]  you're gonna have half a dozen marijuana questions,
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.320]  almost all of which are your state asking
[16:58.320 --> 17:00.240]  if they can keep the extra tax revenue
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.700]  they collected last year,
[17:01.700 --> 17:03.600]  your county asking the same question,
[17:03.600 --> 17:06.440]  your city asking the same question.
[17:06.440 --> 17:09.440]  So get registered to vote people.
[17:09.440 --> 17:10.280]  Register to vote.
[17:10.280 --> 17:11.240]  And guys in the future,
[17:11.240 --> 17:12.960]  Mike is gonna come do an episode for us
[17:12.960 --> 17:15.240]  all about how to get yourself into politics.
[17:15.240 --> 17:18.240]  If you're ready to lobby for cannabis or anything else,
[17:18.240 --> 17:20.560]  Mike is gonna come kind of teach us a little bit.
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.480]  I put him on the spot now.
[17:21.480 --> 17:22.300]  He just looked at me like,
[17:22.300 --> 17:23.880]  shit, now I really have to do that.
[17:23.880 --> 17:25.320]  Yep, it's gonna happen people.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.320]  It'll just be a quickie bro.
[17:26.320 --> 17:28.360]  Just teach my friends that are listening
[17:28.360 --> 17:31.040]  how to get into politics, how to get themselves started,
[17:31.040 --> 17:33.880]  get them going to council meetings and shaking hands.
[17:33.880 --> 17:35.540]  Mike will get you on the right track.
[17:35.540 --> 17:37.860]  All right, so that was our article from Pueblo.
[17:37.860 --> 17:39.080]  Let's see how long we've been recording
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.480]  before we jump into anything else.
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.880]  All right, we got some time left.
[17:41.880 --> 17:42.720]  We're doing good.
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.360]  We're doing very well.
[17:44.360 --> 17:45.400]  You need a dab?
[17:45.400 --> 17:46.880]  I could definitely go for a dab.
[17:46.880 --> 17:47.720]  I'll get you a dab.
[17:47.720 --> 17:49.020]  You want CBD or THC?
[17:50.240 --> 17:51.080]  Ooh.
[17:51.080 --> 17:53.200]  I've got, well, your options are here this Tora Bora
[17:53.200 --> 17:55.320]  that was grown by myself and extracted by our good friends
[17:55.360 --> 17:56.480]  at the Garden of Weden.
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.680]  Shout out family, much love.
[17:58.680 --> 18:01.520]  And then from our good friends over at Terpex,
[18:01.520 --> 18:03.040]  Terpy boys.
[18:03.040 --> 18:04.160]  What's up fellas?
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.440]  And I picked this up over at the Green and Healthy Wellness
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.040]  in lovely Colorado Springs.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.000]  I really liked that place.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.240]  I was in a week or two ago.
[18:11.240 --> 18:12.400]  Very nice guys, right?
[18:12.400 --> 18:13.480]  Shout out to John John.
[18:13.480 --> 18:14.320]  Great fellas.
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.040]  John Randles Jr.
[18:16.040 --> 18:16.880]  What's up buddy?
[18:18.680 --> 18:21.160]  We got some Durban poison on the sativa end of things.
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.880]  And we've got some 818 headband,
[18:22.880 --> 18:25.480]  which in my opinion is more on the Indica side of things.
[18:25.480 --> 18:27.320]  I feel like I'm on getting dug with high right now.
[18:27.320 --> 18:28.520]  I think it's poison time.
[18:28.520 --> 18:30.160]  Go for the poison.
[18:30.160 --> 18:31.000]  Poison.
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.200]  I think I'm gonna get sued if I do that too much longer.
[18:36.200 --> 18:37.840]  You get what, 15 seconds?
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.680]  There are rules around that and I read them.
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.720]  And as long as I'm not making money,
[18:43.720 --> 18:45.880]  it's cool if nobody gets mad.
[18:45.880 --> 18:48.120]  If they get offended, they can make me take it down.
[18:48.120 --> 18:51.400]  But really it's like a fair use act law.
[18:51.400 --> 18:52.240]  Right.
[18:52.680 --> 18:54.400]  I'm just talking out of my ass kind of right now.
[18:54.400 --> 18:55.880]  I don't remember exactly what I read,
[18:55.880 --> 18:58.200]  but you can and can't at the same time.
[18:58.200 --> 18:59.360]  And it's up to whoever.
[18:59.360 --> 19:01.320]  If I get permission, then I can use whatever I want.
[19:01.320 --> 19:03.720]  Like the songs I use in the intros and outros,
[19:03.720 --> 19:05.960]  Mystic Roots Band has given me full permission.
[19:05.960 --> 19:08.040]  DJ Nickity has given me permission.
[19:08.040 --> 19:11.160]  I totally just tried to stab the microphone.
[19:12.200 --> 19:14.440]  So Mike held up the rig.
[19:14.440 --> 19:16.040]  I don't know if that was your second time doing it
[19:16.040 --> 19:17.240]  or if you're the second person,
[19:17.240 --> 19:20.840]  but he put his mouth full on to the microphone
[19:20.840 --> 19:23.160]  and tried to dab through the microphone.
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.720]  I went to put the dab on the nail
[19:24.720 --> 19:27.120]  and for some reason put my face on the microphone
[19:27.120 --> 19:29.000]  as though that was gonna do anything for me.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.080]  I saw the process happen in your brain
[19:31.080 --> 19:32.320]  and it was fucking funny.
[19:32.320 --> 19:34.120]  All right, I'm gonna start reading this article.
[19:34.120 --> 19:37.040]  I don't even remember what the hell I was saying anymore.
[19:37.040 --> 19:39.440]  Feds tell their employees to stay away from marijuana,
[19:39.440 --> 19:41.880]  even in states that have legalized.
[19:41.880 --> 19:44.180]  So if you're a federal agent.
[19:45.080 --> 19:47.360]  Shout out to Terpy Boys, that was delicious.
[19:47.360 --> 19:48.960]  Oh yeah, big shout out to the Terpy Crew.
[19:48.960 --> 19:51.360]  We're gonna get them back on the podcast again.
[19:52.320 --> 19:54.240]  I'll have my car back here within the next few days.
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.780]  So I'll be able to go do a podcast with the Terpy Boy Crew.
[19:57.780 --> 19:59.440]  Shout out to the Cannabis Grand Crew.
[19:59.440 --> 20:01.920]  That's happening as we record right now.
[20:01.920 --> 20:04.840]  I wish we were there, but I was not prepared.
[20:04.840 --> 20:07.520]  So this article, if you're a mailman,
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.680]  what a mail person, we shouldn't say mailman
[20:09.680 --> 20:11.880]  because they're a female mail carrier.
[20:11.880 --> 20:15.880]  If you're a mail carrier, is this a state park people?
[20:15.880 --> 20:16.720]  If you work for the Department of Wildlife?
[20:16.720 --> 20:17.560]  Department of Wildlife.
[20:17.560 --> 20:21.040]  Park Rangers, anybody that works for the federal government.
[20:21.040 --> 20:24.360]  It's a huge number of people, IRS, FBI.
[20:24.360 --> 20:26.200]  IRS can't smoke weed no more?
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.040]  No.
[20:27.040 --> 20:28.720]  Oh man, if I had to crunch numbers like that all day,
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.560]  I couldn't take a dad.
[20:29.560 --> 20:30.720]  Post office going up.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.800]  Yup, so let's read the article.
[20:34.800 --> 20:36.760]  The federal government wants to clear
[20:36.760 --> 20:40.400]  with its federal employees that might live in states
[20:40.400 --> 20:42.420]  that have reformed their marijuana laws.
[20:42.420 --> 20:45.320]  Marijuana remains illegal, so don't use it.
[20:45.360 --> 20:47.760]  In guidance issued this week from Catherine Archuleta,
[20:47.760 --> 20:50.600]  director of the US Office of Personal Management,
[20:50.600 --> 20:52.420]  that's personnel management,
[20:52.420 --> 20:54.960]  to the heads of all federal departments and agencies,
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.600]  Archuleta says in no uncertain terms that marijuana use
[20:58.600 --> 21:02.000]  for the more than 4.1 million federal employees
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.240]  across the nation is banned.
[21:05.560 --> 21:06.980]  Not a shocker.
[21:06.980 --> 21:07.820]  No, not at all.
[21:07.820 --> 21:09.440]  But what about, man,
[21:09.440 --> 21:10.980]  people need to smoke their medical cannabis.
[21:10.980 --> 21:13.320]  If that's what makes you feel better,
[21:13.320 --> 21:14.480]  you need to be able to do that.
[21:14.480 --> 21:16.720]  Feds don't care, schedule one.
[21:16.720 --> 21:17.560]  Yeah, the feds have no heart.
[21:17.560 --> 21:20.160]  A high level of abuse, no medical use.
[21:20.160 --> 21:21.520]  Feds have no heart.
[21:21.520 --> 21:24.160]  Federal law on marijuana remains unchanged,
[21:24.160 --> 21:27.280]  she writes in a letter announcing the guidance.
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.280]  We've got four legal states, 30-some medical states.
[21:31.280 --> 21:32.120]  23.
[21:32.120 --> 21:35.080]  And 23 medical states, and 13 CBD only,
[21:35.080 --> 21:37.880]  and not one of them came with worker protection.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.640]  So you can take any other intoxicating medication
[21:41.640 --> 21:43.640]  you feel like or are prescribed
[21:43.640 --> 21:47.040]  or your doctor recommends, but not cannabis.
[21:47.040 --> 21:48.120]  Not cannabis.
[21:48.120 --> 21:50.040]  It might be intoxicating.
[21:50.040 --> 21:52.800]  So who's, how do we go about writing
[21:52.800 --> 21:54.200]  the worker protection rules?
[21:54.200 --> 21:55.280]  Who does that?
[21:55.280 --> 21:58.280]  That's probably not gonna happen in our lifetime.
[21:58.280 --> 21:59.120]  Start it.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.040]  That's your new job, Mike.
[22:01.040 --> 22:02.560]  There you go, your new calling in life.
[22:02.560 --> 22:05.360]  Okay, someone's gotta pay me for that amount of lobbying.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.520]  All right, guys, there's-
[22:07.520 --> 22:08.920]  Guys, click the donate button.
[22:08.920 --> 22:10.080]  Yep, you know where I'm headed with this.
[22:10.080 --> 22:12.960]  There is a donate button, and you write Mike on there,
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.840]  and then Mike will use that.
[22:13.840 --> 22:16.400]  When that transmission's done getting paid.
[22:16.400 --> 22:18.240]  Oh God, don't remind me.
[22:18.240 --> 22:19.600]  We'll transfer that over to me.
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.960]  Don't remind me.
[22:20.960 --> 22:23.560]  So Mike just, he's not even reading the article,
[22:23.560 --> 22:26.640]  and he just said, while four states have legal,
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.800]  you just read part of the article out of your brain.
[22:28.800 --> 22:30.520]  So federal employees are also part
[22:30.520 --> 22:32.560]  of the Drug-Free Workplace Act guidelines,
[22:32.560 --> 22:35.520]  which ban any use of illegal drugs on and off duty.
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.360]  In general, most of the routine drug testing
[22:37.360 --> 22:39.480]  of federal employees primarily occurs
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.600]  within federal agencies that have personnel
[22:41.640 --> 22:43.280]  with safety-sensitive jobs,
[22:43.280 --> 22:46.520]  like those working in law enforcement or national security.
[22:47.680 --> 22:49.200]  This would be a good time to mention
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.280]  to those of you living in not Colorado,
[22:52.280 --> 22:54.640]  thinking about moving to heaven,
[22:54.640 --> 22:56.800]  and for our wonderful Wheelaws
[22:56.800 --> 22:59.800]  that have a job when you get here,
[22:59.800 --> 23:01.480]  because they're gonna drug test,
[23:01.480 --> 23:03.680]  just like the one in Minneapolis,
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.040]  wherever you're flying from, Texas.
[23:06.040 --> 23:08.520]  Yep, I had a friend that had to pass a drug test yesterday.
[23:08.520 --> 23:10.520]  In fact, she's like, how do I do it?
[23:10.520 --> 23:12.760]  And I was like, I don't know.
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.320]  If I have to take a pee test,
[23:14.320 --> 23:16.760]  I don't even wanna work there.
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.080]  I had to do that back before dabs were a thing,
[23:20.080 --> 23:21.680]  and dabs have been a thing for a while,
[23:21.680 --> 23:24.440]  so I've probably forgotten exactly how to do that now.
[23:25.480 --> 23:27.040]  My way of doing it is,
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.280]  the only way I can do it is use fake piss.
[23:29.280 --> 23:31.240]  It's the only way I've ever been able to pass a pee test.
[23:31.240 --> 23:33.720]  You go buy that fake pee and keep it warm.
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.920]  I just took breaks, and I was just be sober.
[23:36.920 --> 23:38.160]  It was never that painful.
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.360]  One time, dude, I went 63 days
[23:41.200 --> 23:43.560]  without smoking, and I still failed the drug test.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.740]  And I really didn't smoke.
[23:44.740 --> 23:46.000]  Everyone's like, you had to have smoked.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.520]  And I was like, no, I went to Reggae on the Rocks
[23:47.520 --> 23:50.040]  with my brother Bradley and rolled down the windows
[23:50.040 --> 23:52.280]  when he puffed, and I did not puff at all.
[23:52.280 --> 23:55.600]  He was laughing at me, and I still failed the pee test.
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.920]  So if you're a fed in any way, who else is a fed?
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.600]  We always said mailman's, park rangers.
[24:00.600 --> 24:03.080]  Well, it applies to all sorts of stuff, CDOT.
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.200]  There's a number of different professions,
[24:08.200 --> 24:10.320]  I suppose is the easiest way to say it,
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.040]  that have rules that the feds get to lay out,
[24:13.040 --> 24:15.040]  regulations that the feds get to lay out.
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.960]  And a lot of it comes with tax breaks, if.
[24:17.960 --> 24:19.840]  And one of those ifs is almost always
[24:19.840 --> 24:22.800]  Drug Free Workplace Act, which is why shit
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.200]  like McDonald's drug tests, like mad.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.040]  They're not gonna have to.
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.880]  They're all gonna be kiosks pretty soon.
[24:27.880 --> 24:28.800]  Yep, yep.
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.920]  All right, that article actually came
[24:29.920 --> 24:32.320]  from the Huffington Post by a dude named Matt Ferner.
[24:32.320 --> 24:35.360]  Thanks for letting me read your article there, Matt Ferner.
[24:35.360 --> 24:38.880]  Let's see, I'll probably get in one more article here.
[24:38.880 --> 24:40.120]  Do you wanna make it a good one?
[24:40.920 --> 24:41.760]  Yeah, we got about five minutes
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.040]  before I wanna start wrapping it up.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.400]  Let's see, that one's gonna be long.
[24:44.400 --> 24:45.240]  That one's kinda cool.
[24:45.240 --> 24:47.320]  Let's wrap this up with a funny one.
[24:47.320 --> 24:48.800]  You guys, we talked a whole bunch of stuff.
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.800]  If you made it to the 30 minute mark in this show,
[24:50.800 --> 24:52.240]  here is something great for you.
[24:52.240 --> 24:53.080]  Thanks for hanging in.
[24:53.080 --> 24:55.000]  Yeah, this one is good, you guys.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.320]  It says, and where is this from?
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.320]  Okay, this is from Pendleton, Oregon.
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.960]  And it says, man asks city to ban fart smells
[25:04.960 --> 25:06.000]  for a good reason.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.400]  And this came from the Huffington Post.
[25:07.400 --> 25:09.200]  It's written by Hillary Henson.
[25:09.200 --> 25:10.760]  I really liked this story.
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.960]  The article goes like this.
[25:11.960 --> 25:13.040]  You guys are gonna like this also.
[25:13.040 --> 25:14.960]  It says, a resident of Pendleton, Oregon
[25:14.960 --> 25:17.840]  has written a letter requesting the city council ban
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.720]  the smell of farts in the community.
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.000]  But he has good reason to be raising a stink.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.560]  Last week, the city of Pendleton
[25:24.560 --> 25:26.660]  uploaded its nuisance ordinance
[25:26.660 --> 25:30.020]  to cover the smell of marijuana, NBC reported at the time.
[25:30.020 --> 25:32.880]  That means that even though recreational marijuana
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.200]  will be legal in Oregon starting in July,
[25:35.200 --> 25:37.800]  a person can be fined up to $500
[25:37.800 --> 25:39.800]  if someone complains they smell marijuana
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.360]  coming from that person's property.
[25:42.360 --> 25:45.200]  In a letter published in the East Oregonian on Thursday,
[25:45.200 --> 25:47.640]  someone who signed his name as Peter Walters
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.560]  merely asked that council members take the next logical step
[25:50.560 --> 25:53.880]  and start regulating a far more noxious scent.
[25:53.880 --> 25:55.700]  It was with great relief Thursday
[25:55.700 --> 25:58.360]  when I read the East Oregonian
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.440]  that Pendleton City Council took the time
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.600]  to pass an amendment to the city's nuisance order
[26:02.600 --> 26:04.120]  banning marijuana order.
[26:04.120 --> 26:05.800]  Clearly, there has been no issue
[26:05.800 --> 26:07.880]  of greater importance facing the city.
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.080]  Now that this important work has been completed,
[26:10.080 --> 26:12.480]  I hope the council will move on to restricting
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.880]  the other offensive smell that plagues our community, farts.
[26:16.880 --> 26:18.560]  Walters, who is pretty clearly
[26:18.560 --> 26:21.520]  mocking the marijuana ordinances, notes,
[26:21.520 --> 26:23.440]  some habitual farters argue
[26:23.440 --> 26:25.500]  that they need to fart for medical reasons,
[26:25.500 --> 26:27.240]  but that doesn't mean my kids
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.440]  should have to smell their farts.
[26:29.440 --> 26:30.600]  It's just beautiful.
[26:30.600 --> 26:31.420]  That's great.
[26:32.260 --> 26:35.480]  If you're an elected official and you behave absurdly,
[26:36.160 --> 26:38.800]  you people have the right to mock the living shit out of you
[26:38.800 --> 26:40.600]  by sending you public letters
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.440]  asking you to ban the smell of farts.
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.360]  Pueblo, last summer, we passed a smell ordinance down here.
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.000]  It's considered automatically a yes,
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.600]  that's definitely offensive thing
[26:52.600 --> 26:56.080]  if your neighbor whines about the smell of your pot garden.
[26:56.080 --> 26:58.160]  You can be smoking marijuana on your porch
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.520]  and that smell cannot be considered automatically offensive,
[27:01.520 --> 27:04.120]  but growing marijuana is automatically offensive
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.400]  by a city ordinance.
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.160]  It's the only odor that you can get in trouble for in Pueblo.
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.000]  Well, if this passes,
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.560]  I pretty much can't go to Pendleton, Oregon.
[27:13.560 --> 27:15.960]  Banned.
[27:15.960 --> 27:17.980]  I will be fined, I mean, oops,
[27:17.980 --> 27:20.200]  500 bucks every couple of minutes out of me.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.760]  I'm a farting fool on some days.
[27:21.760 --> 27:23.280]  I think it's this vegetarian diet.
[27:23.280 --> 27:24.740]  That's what do it to me.
[27:24.740 --> 27:27.340]  All right, so pretty soon you guys in Pendleton, Oregon,
[27:27.340 --> 27:28.580]  they're gonna ban farts.
[27:28.580 --> 27:30.360]  Not really, but I think that's a great way
[27:30.360 --> 27:33.360]  to respond to some dipshit ordinances
[27:33.400 --> 27:35.080]  made by some dipshit people.
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.720]  Big shout out to the guy who signed his name
[27:37.720 --> 27:38.960]  as Peter Walters.
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.800]  I don't know who you are.
[27:39.800 --> 27:40.620]  Way to go, Peter.
[27:40.620 --> 27:43.320]  But you're one of my heroes today, shout out, bro.
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.560]  So we've gone 30 minutes.
[27:45.560 --> 27:46.640]  We've got some more news,
[27:46.640 --> 27:48.480]  but we're gonna save that for another episode
[27:48.480 --> 27:51.080]  because you guys really like these 30 minute episodes.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.540]  Dude, Mike, thanks for hanging out with me today.
[27:52.540 --> 27:53.800]  Thanks for recording the podcast.
[27:53.800 --> 27:55.680]  Thanks for kind of being my chauffeur.
[27:55.680 --> 27:57.160]  That little Ford Focus is killer.
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.200]  We just need to get you a better stereo in there, bro.
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.280]  Oh yeah, that whole car is from 2001.
[28:02.280 --> 28:03.120]  Well, it's not the car,
[28:03.120 --> 28:04.880]  it's what the radio plays around here.
[28:04.880 --> 28:07.960]  Makes me want to stab my ears with fucking butter knives.
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.800]  It's terrible.
[28:08.800 --> 28:10.520]  Clear Channel's taken over the world
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.240]  and I've been back or pushed back to FM recently
[28:14.240 --> 28:16.440]  and it's been a tough transition.
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.400]  I'm pretty sure I heard Taylor Swift, Poison, Metallica,
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.240]  and I think it was some Bon Jovi on the way over here
[28:23.240 --> 28:24.080]  just as you channel surfed.
[28:24.080 --> 28:25.520]  Yeah, we were in the car for a while.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.200]  It got fucking bad, people.
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.040]  Yeah.
[28:28.040 --> 28:30.480]  Thank God the digital age came along when it did.
[28:30.480 --> 28:31.880]  I'll be so glad to get my car back
[28:32.480 --> 28:34.000]  and then we'll get everything back together.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.520]  Shout out to all the people that have helped me out.
[28:35.520 --> 28:36.880]  There are a couple of people that have really given me
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.640]  some rides and shit for the past few days.
[28:38.640 --> 28:39.760]  Done me some favors.
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.520]  Shout out to the people that have showed up at my house
[28:41.520 --> 28:45.280]  with food because I hate eating food that I have at home.
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.520]  I cook the same shit all the time.
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.760]  There are a couple of people that have showed up
[28:47.760 --> 28:48.600]  with some fatty meals.
[28:48.600 --> 28:50.560]  It's hard to be a homebound vegetarian.
[28:50.560 --> 28:52.000]  Yeah, right, because all my shit's fresh.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.800]  You can't stock the fridge for more than three days.
[28:54.800 --> 28:56.560]  Yup, yeah, well, I can get a few.
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.360]  You know, more than a few days.
[28:58.360 --> 29:00.260]  I bought a shit ton of bananas and apples
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.600]  and I've been eating all kinds of goodies.
[29:02.320 --> 29:04.120]  So thanks to the people that have helped me out.
[29:04.120 --> 29:05.280]  We're gonna wrap up a show.
[29:05.280 --> 29:06.920]  Mike, remind these people how they can follow you
[29:06.920 --> 29:08.520]  on Twitter one more time.
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.960]  At Nemopunk15.
[29:09.960 --> 29:10.800]  Right on there.
[29:10.800 --> 29:11.840]  Follow me, guys, because he does do
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.080]  a lot of cannabis posting.
[29:13.080 --> 29:13.920]  He's one of my homies.
[29:13.920 --> 29:14.760]  He's part of the team.
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.520]  If you follow me from the podcast,
[29:16.520 --> 29:18.760]  just shoot me a tweet saying that's why you're following me
[29:18.760 --> 29:21.000]  because every time I do a show,
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.200]  I get random followers all week long.
[29:23.200 --> 29:24.040]  Nice.
[29:24.040 --> 29:26.480]  And I have to wonder if it's me taunting Kevin Sebette
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.240]  that day or the podcast and I just, I'll never know.
[29:30.360 --> 29:31.920]  Now all these people are gonna go troll
[29:31.920 --> 29:33.920]  Kevin Sebette for you.
[29:33.920 --> 29:35.440]  If they're following me on Twitter,
[29:35.440 --> 29:38.400]  it's something they're gonna get to enjoy anyway.
[29:38.400 --> 29:39.360]  Nice.
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.480]  Man, it was a pleasure recording with you.
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.340]  I'm gonna wrap up the show.
[29:41.340 --> 29:42.400]  So it goes like this, you guys.
[29:42.400 --> 29:43.760]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[29:43.760 --> 29:44.940]  I'll be back.

[30:31.240 --> 30:32.060]  I'll keep them honest.

[30:35.660 --> 30:36.560]  Go to the iTunes store.
[30:36.560 --> 30:37.980]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[30:37.980 --> 30:39.240]  Find the review section.
[30:39.240 --> 30:40.440]  Give me a five-star rating.
[30:40.440 --> 30:41.740]  And after that, type in a little comment.
[30:41.740 --> 30:42.840]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[30:42.840 --> 30:45.200]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[30:45.200 --> 30:47.200]  I really appreciate the comments.
[30:47.200 --> 30:48.720]  That keeps the show moving up in the ranks.
[30:48.720 --> 30:50.840]  It keeps more people aware of the show.
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.360]  The more people that know about the show,
[30:52.360 --> 30:53.900]  the more people will listen to the show.
[30:53.900 --> 30:55.000]  They'll grow better cannabis.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.240]  Tell your dealer about the show, yo.

[30:59.440 --> 31:01.240]  Tell your grower about the show.
[31:01.240 --> 31:02.240]  Yeah, tell everybody about it.
[31:02.240 --> 31:03.600]  Tell your grandma about it, too.
[31:03.600 --> 31:04.600]  Tell like five people.
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.520]  Because if you tell five people,
[31:05.520 --> 31:07.520]  then two people will probably listen.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.360]  So more people learn about the show.

[31:55.400 --> 32:00.000]  for workers protection for medical cannabis use,
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.200]  go ahead and send him, what do you need, a couple million?
[32:02.200 --> 32:03.020]  Yeah.
[32:03.020 --> 32:04.120]  Yeah, a couple mil should do it.
[32:04.120 --> 32:05.280]  Like eight to 10.
[32:05.280 --> 32:06.840]  Don't drop that in my PayPal account
[32:06.840 --> 32:08.840]  because I don't wanna pay taxes on that eight to 10 million.
[32:08.840 --> 32:09.760]  Just send me an email.
[32:09.760 --> 32:12.600]  Yeah, shoot us an email and I'll set up my own PayPal account
[32:12.600 --> 32:14.120]  if you wanna fund that particular effort.
[32:14.120 --> 32:14.960]  There you go.
[32:14.960 --> 32:15.840]  If you wanna throw a few thousand,
[32:15.840 --> 32:17.480]  or you know what, if you got a bunch of pennies
[32:17.480 --> 32:20.240]  you wanna throw at the podcast, we would appreciate it.
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.720]  We could use a couple new mic covers.
[32:21.720 --> 32:23.280]  I've been spitting into this one for a minute.
[32:23.280 --> 32:24.400]  I just tried to dab this one.
[32:24.400 --> 32:25.600]  It's a little soggy now.
[32:26.680 --> 32:27.840]  Yummy.
[32:27.840 --> 32:28.800]  All right, you guys,
