[00:00.000 --> 00:01.440]  Hey, welcome to the show.
[00:01.440 --> 00:05.140]  It's time for episode 418 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.140 --> 00:09.120]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.120 --> 00:14.040]  On 420, Oregon Elite Seeds will be dropping the first batch of blue raspberry truffle
[00:14.040 --> 00:21.520]  from Iry Genetics, so make sure you check them out at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.800]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I am dabbing.
[00:25.800 --> 00:31.720]  I just took a dab of Blackberry Banana Kush Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:31.720 --> 00:38.880]  The potency label says that this is 74.4% THC and 85.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.880 --> 00:42.440]  I really like the Blackberry Banana Kush.
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.760]  Perfect ratio of turps to crunchy diamonds, beautiful color, the flavor was perfect, and
[00:47.760 --> 00:49.280]  the high is just right.
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.220]  So again, big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:53.220 --> 00:57.020]  In this episode, I'm going to pick up where we left off in the last show, and I'm going
[00:57.020 --> 00:59.460]  to read an email about Golden Goat.
[00:59.460 --> 01:02.380]  But before we get there, let's do some shout outs from Patreon.
[01:02.380 --> 01:05.220]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Richard Goals.
[01:05.220 --> 01:06.860]  How about a shout out to Keith Klump?
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.820]  I owe a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Remy Redeye, and of course, a big shout
[01:11.820 --> 01:12.820]  out to Brett Gorman.
[01:12.820 --> 01:15.300]  How about a big shout out to my friend Full Monty?
[01:15.300 --> 01:20.100]  And last but not least, how about a big shout out to my friend Riley Hansen?
[01:20.100 --> 01:23.160]  Big thanks to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.320]  If you would like to learn how to get a shout out on the start of the show and become a
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.600]  patron, you can go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:30.600 --> 01:34.260]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:34.260 --> 01:38.360]  At the start of the show, I said I had an email about Golden Goat, so let's get into
[01:38.360 --> 01:39.560]  that email.
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.280]  It goes a lot like this.
[01:41.280 --> 01:47.520]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I am from Prohibition Land, so please do not say my name on the show.
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.520]  I love it when people start the email out like that.
[01:49.520 --> 01:51.240]  It makes it very easy.
[01:51.240 --> 01:54.680]  So I will make sure not to say your name, but thank you for the great email because
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.000]  it goes on like this.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.280]  I have fallen in love with the Golden Goat strain.
[01:59.280 --> 02:02.280]  I have learned that it helps with my migraines and my depression.
[02:02.280 --> 02:06.840]  Yeah, I knew Golden Goat was good for migraines, but I did not know that it was good for depression,
[02:06.840 --> 02:08.440]  so it is good to read that one.
[02:08.440 --> 02:10.140]  I'm glad that it's helping you there.
[02:10.140 --> 02:13.920]  It's a bummer to hear that you've got depression, but it's great to hear that the Golden Goat
[02:13.920 --> 02:14.920]  is working.
[02:14.920 --> 02:16.000]  The message goes on.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.420]  It says, in reading about the Golden Goat, I have discovered that you have bred a lot
[02:20.420 --> 02:23.400]  of strains with and from the Golden Goat.
[02:23.400 --> 02:27.200]  Maybe you can tell us on the podcast why you fell in love with Golden Goat and why you
[02:27.200 --> 02:29.540]  use it in so many of your projects.
[02:29.540 --> 02:31.180]  I can't wait to hear from you.
[02:31.180 --> 02:36.340]  Growers love, then they sign their name, then they said, P.S., thank you for all that you
[02:36.340 --> 02:37.340]  do.
[02:37.340 --> 02:38.420]  Hey, you are very welcome.
[02:38.420 --> 02:39.820]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[02:39.820 --> 02:43.520]  Thanks for the support, and thanks for the great email, and thanks for the opportunity
[02:43.520 --> 02:46.500]  to talk about one of my favorite strains, Golden Goat.
[02:46.500 --> 02:48.960]  So let's talk about Golden Goat a little bit.
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.920]  The first thing I should say about Golden Goat is I did not breed or create the Golden
[02:53.920 --> 02:54.920]  Goat.
[02:54.920 --> 02:56.600]  That was not my creation.
[02:56.600 --> 03:01.920]  Golden Goat was bred by a person known as Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[03:01.920 --> 03:03.760]  So I cannot take credit for it.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.880]  I've taken a lot of great pictures of Golden Goat.
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.400]  I have done a lot of breeding with Golden Goat, and I have made feminized seeds of Golden
[03:10.400 --> 03:11.920]  Goat, which I have released to the public.
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.680]  And I've also made Golden Goat BX1, and I've got some Golden Goat BX2 seeds that I've made.
[03:17.720 --> 03:20.520]  So I've done a lot of work with the Golden Goat.
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.400]  The Golden Goat BX1 beans are available through the Hella Dank Seed Company and Oregon Elite
[03:25.400 --> 03:27.120]  Seeds, so check there.
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.840]  If they don't have them, they are unavailable until I make more.
[03:30.840 --> 03:34.120]  The feminized seeds will be available again in July.
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.080]  Check Oregon Elite Seeds first for Golden Goat Fem Seeds.
[03:37.080 --> 03:40.120]  I already know I'm going to get a bunch of emails because I said that I make Golden Goat
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.960]  seeds, so those are the places you can check for them.
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.240]  Oregon Elite Seeds and the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.
[03:48.240 --> 03:50.760]  That's where you may be able to find Golden Goat seeds.
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.240]  I did not make the original Golden Goat, but I did make feminized seeds.
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.520]  I did make a bat cross.
[03:55.520 --> 03:58.600]  That was made by Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[03:58.600 --> 04:00.800]  Let's talk about the cross of Golden Goat.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.960]  What are the parents of Golden Goat?
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.640]  It is a Hawaiian sativa crossed to Romulan male that pollinated an island sweet skunk
[04:08.640 --> 04:10.240]  female.
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.180]  Also knowing a little bit about each of those parents, I can tell you where a lot of those
[04:13.180 --> 04:14.620]  traits came from.
[04:14.620 --> 04:17.860]  That tall, stretchy thing comes from the Hawaiian sativa.
[04:17.860 --> 04:21.920]  That tropical flavor comes from the island sweet skunk and the Hawaiian sativa.
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.720]  That short, squatty structure is mostly from the Romulan.
[04:25.720 --> 04:28.080]  The finishing time comes from the Romulan.
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.040]  So it is a beautiful combination of all three of those crosses, and I think it worked out
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.080]  beautifully in my opinion.
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.080]  There is another phenotype that was not released as widely and was not as popular as the Golden
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.080]  Goat.
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.800]  To the best of my knowledge, that phenotype was labeled Funky Bitch.
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.920]  I have seen Funky Bitch flowers and concentrates available in dispensaries in the Denver area,
[04:49.920 --> 04:55.240]  but there is no way for me to know if that is the original Funky Bitch released by Mr.
[04:55.240 --> 05:00.720]  Dank or if that is just another fish fan using the name Funky Bitch because it is a song
[05:00.720 --> 05:02.960]  that fish plays a cover of.
[05:02.960 --> 05:06.680]  So that's a quick breakdown on the genetic history of Golden Goat.
[05:06.680 --> 05:12.520]  It is a Hawaiian sativa crossed to Romulan male that pollinated an island sweet skunk
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.640]  female that created the Golden Goat.
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.600]  There may be another phenotype known as Funky Bitch roaming around somewhere out there.
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.400]  That was made by Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.160]  Let's talk about why Mr. Dank named it Golden Goat.
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.880]  In parts of the country, there is a recycling center that is called the Golden Goat Recycling
[05:29.880 --> 05:30.880]  Center.
[05:30.880 --> 05:37.320]  In the thick of the summer, that soda in the recycling center gets a sticky sweet smell.
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.160]  Mr. Dank thought that Golden Goat smelled just like that recycling center.
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.240]  So that is where that name came from.
[05:43.240 --> 05:48.720]  Golden Goat came from the aroma of the Golden Goat recycling plant near Mr. Dank's home
[05:48.720 --> 05:52.440]  in Topeka or near the grow in Topeka.
[05:52.440 --> 05:55.840]  Golden Goat generally flowers in around 60 days.
[05:55.840 --> 05:57.340]  It can come down a little bit earlier.
[05:57.340 --> 05:59.120]  It can come down a little bit later.
[05:59.120 --> 06:00.520]  Just depends on what you're looking for.
[06:01.160 --> 06:02.240]  It depends on your environment.
[06:02.240 --> 06:06.880]  In a commercial environment, I would run her for nine weeks and she would be beautifully,
[06:06.880 --> 06:09.960]  perfectly done at the end of the nine-week flowering period.
[06:09.960 --> 06:14.760]  She gave me big fat heavy harvest and I really like running Golden Goat in a small grow and
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.760]  in a large grow.
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.640]  We're going to talk more about that in just a little bit.
[06:18.640 --> 06:25.560]  Golden Goat is consistently a very potent, a very high THC tester when it comes to lab
[06:25.560 --> 06:26.560]  tests.
[06:26.560 --> 06:28.440]  It comes back in the high 20s every time.
[06:28.440 --> 06:34.600]  I have not gotten it past 29% yet, but I have gotten a 29% THC lab test from Golden Goat.
[06:34.600 --> 06:37.640]  So it is a consistently high tester.
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.140]  And that tropical Golden Goat, that sweet, sticky aroma, that tropical saltwater aroma
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.040]  that comes from it, it can't be beat.
[06:45.040 --> 06:47.800]  It is very unique and it is very desirable.
[06:47.800 --> 06:50.400]  When you have it in the bag, it looks beautiful.
[06:50.400 --> 06:51.720]  It produces heavy.
[06:51.720 --> 06:55.400]  Let's get into a little bit more detail of how I fell in love with Golden Goat.
[06:55.400 --> 06:56.560]  I've told you the genetics.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.800]  You know where it came from.
[06:58.160 --> 06:59.920]  You know how long it takes to flower.
[06:59.920 --> 07:02.280]  How did I end up with this Golden Goat?
[07:02.280 --> 07:05.320]  I had a friend who I met when I was working in a dispensary.
[07:05.320 --> 07:08.560]  This guy probably doesn't want his name blasted on a podcast.
[07:08.560 --> 07:12.040]  I nicknamed him Pineapple Express because he was really from Hawaii.
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.300]  So I just thought it was funny.
[07:13.300 --> 07:14.640]  He was my stoner friend.
[07:14.640 --> 07:15.840]  He was from Hawaii.
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.640]  His nickname for this show will be Pineapple Express.
[07:18.640 --> 07:21.000]  So Pineapple Express and I became really good friends.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.400]  We hung out quite often.
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.400]  We would smoke together.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.740]  We would bullshit together.
[07:24.740 --> 07:26.840]  We would do clone trades together.
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.920]  We would talk about each other's gardens together.
[07:28.920 --> 07:30.880]  We were just pothead buddies.
[07:30.880 --> 07:34.840]  One day, my friend Pineapple Express was gifted a clone of the Golden Goat.
[07:34.840 --> 07:37.120]  He asked me if I knew anything about the plant.
[07:37.120 --> 07:40.320]  And I told him I had heard nothing but good things about Golden Goat and that I would
[07:40.320 --> 07:41.840]  love a clone of it.
[07:41.840 --> 07:45.400]  At the time, I had been buying Golden Goat from a local dispensary known as the Greener
[07:45.400 --> 07:47.760]  Side and I was really happy with the product.
[07:47.760 --> 07:51.880]  There was a lot of Golden Goat going around the area and I was really impressed with it.
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.680]  So to get my hands on this plant, I knew I could really grow the shit out of it.
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.480]  So our friend Pineapple Express gave me a clone of the Golden Goat.
[08:00.480 --> 08:03.800]  I grew it until I could get a clone off of it so that I had a keeper.
[08:03.800 --> 08:07.960]  Then I flowered out that first little Golden Goat and my first run with that plant was
[08:07.960 --> 08:09.480]  impressive.
[08:09.480 --> 08:13.400]  Whatever I was doing with my nutrient regimen, whatever I was doing with my lights, whatever
[08:13.400 --> 08:18.640]  my VPD was, whatever was happening in my grow environment, Golden Goat said, hey, that is
[08:18.640 --> 08:19.640]  fucking awesome.
[08:19.640 --> 08:20.640]  Keep doing that.
[08:20.640 --> 08:24.360]  It was kind of like I had found the plant that went in my room.
[08:24.360 --> 08:25.920]  Most of my plants were really happy.
[08:25.920 --> 08:26.920]  Everything looked really good.
[08:26.920 --> 08:31.260]  But when I put Golden Goat in that environment, it was like, hey, I am the happiest plant
[08:31.260 --> 08:33.360]  you can ever find for this environment.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.800]  I didn't have to adjust anything.
[08:34.800 --> 08:36.340]  I didn't have to change my feed.
[08:36.340 --> 08:38.280]  I didn't have to change my grow style.
[08:38.280 --> 08:43.320]  It really blew up and it really excelled in my room just the way it was.
[08:43.320 --> 08:46.520]  So that made me fall in love with it right away in the very beginning.
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.640]  So it was a gifted clone that I had heard a lot about, that I had smoked already, that
[08:50.640 --> 08:52.840]  I had enjoyed and I knew I wanted.
[08:52.840 --> 08:55.560]  And when I got it, I crushed it in my first grow.
[08:55.560 --> 08:57.640]  So that made me really happy right away.
[08:57.640 --> 09:00.920]  I also took some tremendous photos.
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.400]  Some of the very first photos I posted to social media were of Golden Goat.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.920]  I tried to stay away from the Facebook and that sort of thing for a long time.
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.720]  I was posting on other places, very cannabis-specific forums and groups and things like that.
[09:14.720 --> 09:18.120]  But things like Facebook and Instagram, I was a little bit afraid to go on something
[09:18.120 --> 09:21.580]  so public, so mainstream and share my cannabis photos.
[09:21.580 --> 09:26.180]  I showed a few pictures of the Golden Goat to my friend Pineapple Express and he really
[09:26.180 --> 09:28.420]  encouraged me to put them online.
[09:28.420 --> 09:33.300]  So I made the Iry Genetics Facebook and I started posting photos of Golden Goat as my
[09:33.300 --> 09:37.860]  very first post on my Facebook for Iry Genetics.
[09:37.860 --> 09:39.780]  So that was my first grow with Golden Goat.
[09:39.780 --> 09:43.460]  The photos were good enough to where my friend Pineapple Express felt that I should create
[09:43.460 --> 09:45.980]  a social media page just for those photos.
[09:45.980 --> 09:51.100]  So that inspired a lot of more photography, a lot more sharing, a lot more social interaction,
[09:51.140 --> 09:55.900]  a lot more social media interaction, and actually a large expansion of what I wanted to be a
[09:55.900 --> 09:59.340]  very small seed company to make seeds for myself and my friends.
[09:59.340 --> 10:03.180]  It ended up getting a little out of hand and it has become a little bit more than that,
[10:03.180 --> 10:05.700]  but that is a whole other podcast to talk about.
[10:05.700 --> 10:07.620]  Let's focus on Golden Goat here.
[10:07.620 --> 10:11.500]  Golden Goat was, I was already amazed by this plant before I got a hold of it.
[10:11.500 --> 10:14.700]  When I grew it and I grew the shit out of it the first time, I fell in love.
[10:14.700 --> 10:15.860]  That's where I fell in love.
[10:15.860 --> 10:17.020]  It was such a fun grow.
[10:17.020 --> 10:18.440]  It was so easy.
[10:18.440 --> 10:20.980]  Anything I could do to this plant, it could take it.
[10:20.980 --> 10:23.940]  Then when I smoked it, I was so proud of myself.
[10:23.940 --> 10:25.180]  It tasted amazing.
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.860]  The potency was tremendous.
[10:26.860 --> 10:27.860]  It was perfect.
[10:27.860 --> 10:29.440]  It didn't take a lot to dry and cure it.
[10:29.440 --> 10:32.480]  You can't really fuck up Golden Goat unless you're trying.
[10:32.480 --> 10:33.480]  You have to kind of try.
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.180]  And I'm sure there's somebody out there that has destroyed a Golden Goat plant.
[10:36.180 --> 10:37.180]  They just put their head down.
[10:37.180 --> 10:38.180]  I apologize.
[10:38.180 --> 10:40.380]  But for the way I grow, I couldn't fuck it up.
[10:40.380 --> 10:42.540]  It was love and life in my grow.
[10:42.540 --> 10:43.940]  So it was great flower.
[10:43.940 --> 10:46.020]  I had gigantic harvests.
[10:46.020 --> 10:50.620]  Some of my biggest harvests in my personal grows, not in a commercial environment, have
[10:50.760 --> 10:53.700]  come from Golden Goat and Golden Goat dominant hybrids.
[10:53.700 --> 10:57.540]  We'll talk about a couple of those in the future if we don't run out of time.
[10:57.540 --> 11:03.980]  In an indoor personal grow environment, I am able to easily pull 2.5 pounds per thousand
[11:03.980 --> 11:05.540]  watt light with Golden Goat.
[11:05.540 --> 11:11.060]  In a commercial environment, it would not be unheard of for me to pull over three pounds
[11:11.060 --> 11:16.780]  per light in a commercial environment with Golden Goat or Golden Goat dominant genetics.
[11:16.780 --> 11:20.340]  So it is a very generous plant once you learn to work with it.
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.340]  And this isn't really a grow lesson on Golden Goat.
[11:23.340 --> 11:25.300]  This is more on how I fell in love with it.
[11:25.300 --> 11:28.980]  It will get nutrient deficient very easily.
[11:28.980 --> 11:30.460]  It wants more nutrients.
[11:30.460 --> 11:32.300]  It wants macronutrients all day.
[11:32.300 --> 11:35.060]  You will see it start to get deficient and you will never catch up.
[11:35.060 --> 11:37.580]  You'll have to foliar feed it to get it enough nutrients.
[11:37.580 --> 11:38.980]  So stay on top of it.
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.780]  It'll get macronutrient early.
[11:40.780 --> 11:42.340]  So feed it kind of heavily.
[11:42.340 --> 11:44.540]  But that is how you get that plant to take off.
[11:44.540 --> 11:46.140]  That's how you get those big fat harvests.
[11:46.140 --> 11:48.060]  You've got to feed it very well.
[11:48.100 --> 11:51.420]  So I said earlier that some of my best harvests were from Golden Goat.
[11:51.420 --> 11:55.180]  Some of my most impressive photos were also from Golden Goat.
[11:55.180 --> 11:59.540]  There's a Golden Goat photo that is in front of a Colorado flag that goes around.
[11:59.540 --> 12:03.300]  It's been reposted and reposted on a lot of social media outlets.
[12:03.300 --> 12:05.220]  That is a picture I am very proud of.
[12:05.220 --> 12:07.180]  That is a grow that I am very proud of.
[12:07.180 --> 12:08.940]  That was a beautiful grow.
[12:08.940 --> 12:10.500]  I lollipopped those plants.
[12:10.500 --> 12:13.500]  I did six of those Golden Goat plants in seven gallon pots.
[12:13.500 --> 12:16.740]  So I had six seven gallon pots under 1000 watt light.
[12:16.780 --> 12:18.860]  I lollipopped them fairly high.
[12:18.860 --> 12:19.900]  I did not top them.
[12:19.900 --> 12:22.100]  So they had one big fat glory bud.
[12:22.100 --> 12:27.820]  And I pulled 2.5 pounds of usable buds and then plenty of small popcorn buds and
[12:27.820 --> 12:32.940]  usable trim that we turned into concentrates underneath 1000 watt light.
[12:32.940 --> 12:35.420]  And those buds were some of the most photogenic buds.
[12:35.420 --> 12:38.620]  Those plants were some of the most photogenic, happiest, healthiest looking
[12:38.620 --> 12:40.140]  plants I've ever grown.
[12:40.140 --> 12:41.460]  I lollipopped them beautifully.
[12:41.460 --> 12:43.340]  I defoliated them beautifully.
[12:43.340 --> 12:46.500]  I feel like I took great care of those plants from the beginning to the end.
[12:46.540 --> 12:48.060]  The potency was amazing.
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.180]  The flavor was amazing.
[12:49.180 --> 12:52.060]  I feel like I did everything right with those Golden Goat plants.
[12:52.060 --> 12:56.180]  So things like that will really make you fall in love with the cultivar once you've
[12:56.180 --> 12:57.300]  grown it several times.
[12:57.300 --> 12:59.940]  And that's something I'm going to get off on a tangent here.
[12:59.940 --> 13:03.380]  That's something I feel like a lot of new growers are not doing.
[13:03.380 --> 13:07.620]  They're treating their plants kind of like they're just one night stands.
[13:07.620 --> 13:10.900]  You grow that one strain one time and you want to get rid of it because you saw that
[13:10.900 --> 13:15.780]  somebody posted wedding cake number 44 across to gelato number 75 and they called
[13:15.780 --> 13:19.220]  it wedding gelato number 9,000 and you've got to grow that next.
[13:19.220 --> 13:24.140]  So you get that and you grow it and it did okay, but it wasn't super fucking fire impressive.
[13:24.140 --> 13:28.100]  So you're going to get rid of that and you're going to get the clones of the Mac cross to
[13:28.100 --> 13:29.660]  fucking Wook Dick number seven.
[13:29.660 --> 13:33.700]  You're going to grow that and you'll do okay with it because it's fire genetics, but you're
[13:33.700 --> 13:36.220]  not going to reach its full potential and you're going to be annoyed with that.
[13:36.220 --> 13:37.220]  So you're going to get rid of that.
[13:37.220 --> 13:40.300]  You're going to get something new and you're not going to grow that to its full potential
[13:40.300 --> 13:45.380]  either because you're not going to get a cultivar to its full potential on its first
[13:45.380 --> 13:46.380]  run.
[13:46.380 --> 13:47.380]  You need to learn it.
[13:47.380 --> 13:50.900]  Yeah, you're going to kill it on the first try if you're a good grower with good genetics,
[13:50.900 --> 13:55.280]  but you can ultra fucking kill it on the third and fourth run with those genetics.
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.900]  If you learn it, imagine your dance partner, imagine you're making love to somebody the
[13:59.900 --> 14:03.980]  first time that maybe you kill it the first time, maybe you get lucky, but the first couple
[14:03.980 --> 14:06.900]  times dancing, making love to somebody, it's a little awkward.
[14:06.900 --> 14:08.460]  You're not sure what they're into.
[14:08.460 --> 14:09.820]  You're not sure what you're allowed to do.
[14:09.820 --> 14:11.820]  You're not sure how far you can push the limits.
[14:11.820 --> 14:13.140]  It is the same with the plants.
[14:13.140 --> 14:14.140]  You got to get in there.
[14:14.140 --> 14:18.100]  You got to try it a few times, see what they go, uh-uh, and see if they go, uh-huh.
[14:18.100 --> 14:20.140]  You got to pay attention and you got to learn.
[14:20.140 --> 14:23.260]  Three or four times in, you know exactly what that plant likes.
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.260]  You know how to do it.
[14:24.260 --> 14:27.740]  You know how long it takes and you make it fucking perfect by the third or fourth time.
[14:27.740 --> 14:32.380]  So you need to develop a relationship with these plants and stop running them one time
[14:32.380 --> 14:33.380]  and getting rid of them.
[14:33.380 --> 14:35.300]  If that's what you want to do, go for it.
[14:35.300 --> 14:39.220]  But I feel like you would develop a better relationship with a cultivar and you could
[14:39.620 --> 14:44.500]  have more satisfactory results with the same cultivar if you ran it more than one time
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.060]  and dialed it in and learned what that plant wanted.
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.700]  In fact, I have an episode planned for you in the future that is called Dialed In and
[14:50.700 --> 14:56.020]  we're going to talk about dialing in your garden to get beautiful, perfect flowers.
[14:56.020 --> 14:59.660]  Now let's get my high ass back on track here.
[14:59.660 --> 15:03.060]  So I'm in love with the golden goat because it grows like a champ.
[15:03.060 --> 15:04.740]  It has given me beautiful harvests.
[15:04.740 --> 15:09.300]  It has given me amazing potency and it has given me some amazing photos.
[15:09.300 --> 15:13.940]  It also works very well with my body and my brain chemistry.
[15:13.940 --> 15:17.660]  Something about the buzz from golden goat is very medicating to me.
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.540]  I have a traumatic brain injury.
[15:19.540 --> 15:22.780]  I don't talk about that a lot on the show anymore because that's not what the show's
[15:22.780 --> 15:23.780]  about.
[15:23.780 --> 15:26.540]  I've also got a stomach issue and some blown out knees.
[15:26.540 --> 15:30.180]  When I smoke the golden goat, my traumatic brain injury seems to kind of, I forget that
[15:30.180 --> 15:33.500]  I've got a brain injury, which is really funny if you've got a brain injury and you think
[15:33.500 --> 15:37.060]  about forgetting shit, but I forget about the brain injury and I forget that my brain
[15:37.060 --> 15:41.340]  is broken and all the little weird glitches that are caused by the brain injury, they
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.860]  seem to go away when I smoke golden goat dominant hybrids.
[15:45.860 --> 15:49.620]  It also seems to work very well to keep me motivated and energized.
[15:49.620 --> 15:53.060]  Some cultivars will make people kind of less motivated.
[15:53.060 --> 15:54.180]  It'll kind of wear you out.
[15:54.180 --> 15:55.180]  It'll mellow you out.
[15:55.180 --> 15:57.780]  It'll make you a little slower and possibly less productive.
[15:57.780 --> 16:00.420]  I'm not trying to say that cannabis makes people lazy.
[16:00.420 --> 16:04.620]  When lazy people smoke the wrong type of cannabis, it will make you lazier.
[16:04.620 --> 16:08.860]  When motivated people smoke the wrong strain of cannabis, it could slow down your motivation.
[16:08.860 --> 16:10.980]  Yes, that is a very possible thing.
[16:10.980 --> 16:14.000]  I have found that the golden goat will keep me moving.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.580]  Golden goat and golden goat dominant hybrids keep my brain sharp.
[16:17.580 --> 16:20.980]  They keep me motivated and off of the couch and that is something that I need because
[16:20.980 --> 16:22.100]  I am a busy person.
[16:22.100 --> 16:25.180]  I like to get a lot of shit done every day.
[16:25.180 --> 16:28.060]  So that is another reason why I've fallen in love with the golden goat.
[16:28.060 --> 16:33.980]  It works beautifully for medicinal and recreational purposes for me and it just puts all the pieces
[16:33.980 --> 16:38.860]  back together and I can smoke it day or night and I enjoy it anytime.
[16:38.860 --> 16:43.620]  So basically I enjoy golden goat because we get along very well in all aspects that I
[16:43.620 --> 16:44.700]  could ask for.
[16:44.700 --> 16:49.460]  She grows well, she smokes well, she takes great photos and one of my favorite parts
[16:49.460 --> 16:52.300]  is she breeds very well.
[16:52.300 --> 16:55.580]  Anything I breed to the golden goat comes out better.
[16:55.580 --> 16:59.860]  Golden goat hybrids all bring out that delicious, sweet, tropical flavor.
[16:59.860 --> 17:02.220]  They all come out as pretty heavy producers.
[17:02.220 --> 17:07.780]  They all seem to be fairly resistant to problems like pathogens, like pests, like powdery mildew,
[17:07.780 --> 17:08.940]  like boetritis.
[17:08.940 --> 17:13.240]  They all seem to be fairly pest resistant and everything I cross with golden goat seems
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.660]  to be quite vigorous.
[17:14.660 --> 17:17.380]  All of its offspring have pretty stout stalks.
[17:17.380 --> 17:21.540]  They all seem to grow with pretty sturdy structure and I really like that.
[17:21.540 --> 17:26.580]  Another thing I really like about the golden goat is it does this sort of a spin thing.
[17:26.580 --> 17:31.220]  Most plants, if you look at them from above, they shoot out a node going left and right
[17:31.220 --> 17:35.740]  and then what would be up and down, I'm going to refer to that as north, south, east and
[17:35.740 --> 17:36.740]  west.
[17:36.740 --> 17:41.900]  So most of your cultivars will do a north, south, east and west sort of a stem development
[17:41.900 --> 17:43.660]  or a branching development.
[17:43.660 --> 17:49.060]  The golden goat will do a north, south, east and west and then it throws in another pair.
[17:49.060 --> 17:52.820]  Also where most of your plants have four sets of branches, the golden goat will produce
[17:52.820 --> 17:53.820]  six.
[17:53.820 --> 17:56.140]  It will only do this if you get it super dialed in.
[17:56.140 --> 17:58.340]  That is when it is extremely happy.
[17:58.340 --> 18:00.820]  It'll start making more branching.
[18:00.820 --> 18:05.500]  Then if you crack and twist the golden goat to try to slow it down, she just gets more
[18:05.500 --> 18:09.500]  sturdy, more robust, thicker stalks and then she gets a little bit stronger and she can
[18:09.500 --> 18:12.340]  support those big chunky buds.
[18:12.340 --> 18:16.780]  Golden goat also makes a lot of very sturdy branching and most of her offspring makes
[18:16.780 --> 18:18.940]  a lot of very sturdy branching.
[18:18.980 --> 18:22.580]  I feel like the more branching you have, the more opportunity you have for bud sites.
[18:22.580 --> 18:26.900]  Also sturdier branching means you can make bigger, chunkier, fatter buds and not need
[18:26.900 --> 18:30.100]  as much support and maintenance in the grow room.
[18:30.100 --> 18:34.500]  Another great thing about golden goat is she will get slightly tall on you, but she stays
[18:34.500 --> 18:36.340]  short and bushy for the most part.
[18:36.340 --> 18:40.780]  The Romulan dominance in her keeps her short and gives her a really nice structure.
[18:40.780 --> 18:43.420]  So that is mostly why I love the golden goat.
[18:43.420 --> 18:44.620]  She breeds beautifully.
[18:44.620 --> 18:48.380]  Let's talk about some of the hybrids I have made with golden goat.
[18:48.420 --> 18:53.020]  I have used golden goat as a reversed female and I have taken pollen from the golden goat
[18:53.020 --> 18:54.700]  and made other crosses.
[18:54.700 --> 18:58.700]  The most popular cross from that of course is lemon Jeffrey.
[18:58.700 --> 19:00.820]  Lemon Jeffrey is one of my favorite crosses.
[19:00.820 --> 19:02.260]  That's why it's got my name.
[19:02.260 --> 19:05.720]  It is a reversed golden goat to the lemon skunk.
[19:05.720 --> 19:07.300]  It makes lemon candy.
[19:07.300 --> 19:10.740]  It kind of smells like if you took a box of lemon heads and dumped the lemon heads out
[19:10.740 --> 19:15.100]  and you smell the inside of the box, it's got that soft, sweet, sugary lemon smell to
[19:15.100 --> 19:16.100]  it.
[19:16.100 --> 19:18.060]  We're sort of like country time lemonade powder.
[19:18.740 --> 19:20.620]  That is what I think lemon Jeffrey smells like.
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.420]  It is a very vigorous plant.
[19:22.420 --> 19:26.540]  It is an excellent plant for concentrates and it is an excellent plant for my type of
[19:26.540 --> 19:30.340]  a condition with a traumatic brain injury or people with anxiety.
[19:30.340 --> 19:32.300]  It is a wonderful daytime smoke.
[19:32.300 --> 19:36.420]  So that is one of my favorite golden goat hybrids from the fem direction.
[19:36.420 --> 19:38.500]  Let's talk about the regular seed line.
[19:38.500 --> 19:41.460]  One of my most popular crosses is Arise.
[19:41.460 --> 19:45.620]  Arise is a golden goat female pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[19:45.620 --> 19:48.860]  I have done an entire episode on the strain Arise.
[19:48.860 --> 19:52.420]  If you'd like to listen to an entire episode about the strain Arise, it is episode number
[19:52.420 --> 19:53.420]  329.
[19:53.420 --> 19:55.260]  I think you would enjoy that one.
[19:55.260 --> 19:56.740]  Arise is a great strain.
[19:56.740 --> 19:58.900]  It has got amazing potency.
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.860]  I've actually used an Arise male to make many, many hybrids.
[20:02.860 --> 20:05.780]  I've probably made 30 crosses from Arise.
[20:05.780 --> 20:11.220]  I've only released about 15 or 20 of them, but I have made 30, maybe 40 crosses from
[20:11.220 --> 20:13.780]  an Arise male that I've really fallen in love with.
[20:13.780 --> 20:15.220]  His name is King Solomon.
[20:15.820 --> 20:18.500]  He makes beautiful offspring and he gives everything hyper vigor.
[20:18.500 --> 20:21.020]  I think a lot of that comes from the golden goat.
[20:21.020 --> 20:24.580]  He gives everything a lot of potency that comes from the golden goat.
[20:24.580 --> 20:29.380]  You can see a lot of the golden goat traits in many of his offspring.
[20:29.380 --> 20:32.700]  Another thing that I talked about earlier is Golden Goat BX.
[20:32.700 --> 20:34.660]  I have made a Golden Goat BX.
[20:34.660 --> 20:39.780]  Many people want golden goat seeds, but golden goat is not available in a regular seed form.
[20:39.780 --> 20:42.260]  I have made feminized golden goat seeds.
[20:42.300 --> 20:45.540]  Those are unadulterated pure golden goat S1s.
[20:45.540 --> 20:50.900]  The golden goat BX seeds were made because many people wanted non-feminized golden goat
[20:50.900 --> 20:51.900]  seeds.
[20:51.900 --> 20:53.900]  A lot of people are not fans of fem seeds.
[20:53.900 --> 20:55.220]  They asked for the BX.
[20:55.220 --> 20:58.300]  I thought I could do that, so I made a golden goat BX.
[20:58.300 --> 21:00.620]  I will talk about how I did that.
[21:00.620 --> 21:05.580]  To make a golden goat back cross, I obviously start with a golden goat female.
[21:05.580 --> 21:09.820]  Then I took a male that was very opposite of golden goat.
[21:09.860 --> 21:12.300]  The male that I used was that Daybreaker.
[21:12.300 --> 21:17.100]  The reason I bred the golden goat to the Daybreaker was because they were total opposites in every
[21:17.100 --> 21:18.180]  way.
[21:18.180 --> 21:20.260]  Golden goat has that sativa dominance.
[21:20.260 --> 21:22.620]  It's got thin, long, skinny leaves.
[21:22.620 --> 21:24.340]  It has a taller structure.
[21:24.340 --> 21:27.660]  It has a really tropical, sweet candy sort of a flavor.
[21:27.660 --> 21:31.340]  I thought it was completely different than the Daybreaker plant that I used.
[21:31.340 --> 21:33.940]  Daybreaker was a little more OG Kush-like.
[21:33.940 --> 21:35.100]  It had further node spacing.
[21:35.100 --> 21:36.420]  It was a little bit stretchy.
[21:36.420 --> 21:38.520]  It had big, fat, wide leaves.
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.800]  It had a really dark, musky, funky sort of aroma to it.
[21:41.800 --> 21:44.960]  I knew that crossing those plants would make very unique offspring.
[21:44.960 --> 21:46.640]  That is where the Arise came from.
[21:46.640 --> 21:49.380]  That is where the King Solomon male came from.
[21:49.380 --> 21:55.880]  From that batch of seeds came another very unique, very carefully selected golden goat
[21:55.880 --> 21:57.080]  dominant male.
[21:57.080 --> 21:58.240]  Let's talk about this.
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.020]  I used a golden goat female so that I could obviously find the golden goat phenotype.
[22:03.020 --> 22:08.300]  I used the male Daybreaker because it is completely the opposite of golden goat.
[22:09.080 --> 22:14.220]  This made it very simple for me to identify phenotypes that looked like golden goat and
[22:14.220 --> 22:16.540]  phenotypes that looked like the Daybreaker.
[22:16.540 --> 22:20.380]  I could very quickly cull any phenotypes with a wide leaf.
[22:20.380 --> 22:23.780]  I could cull any phenotypes with a far node spacing.
[22:23.780 --> 22:28.220]  I could cull any phenotypes that had any sort of stretchy branching because that was not
[22:28.220 --> 22:30.340]  golden goat's traits at all.
[22:30.340 --> 22:31.340]  It was very obvious.
[22:31.340 --> 22:33.420]  I could see it in the progeny immediately.
[22:33.420 --> 22:35.380]  I could see it early in veg.
[22:35.380 --> 22:38.620]  Just by leaf size and shape, it was very obvious.
[22:38.620 --> 22:43.580]  Out of a semi-large population of seeds, it was easy for me to cull about half of them
[22:43.580 --> 22:46.780]  because I could see the Daybreaker-leaning phenotypes.
[22:46.780 --> 22:50.500]  Now I am left with mostly golden goat dominant-leaning phenotypes.
[22:50.500 --> 22:55.380]  As they showed more traits of the Daybreaker and less golden goat dominance, I would remove
[22:55.380 --> 22:56.380]  them from the grow.
[22:56.380 --> 22:58.340]  That is not what I was looking for.
[22:58.340 --> 23:03.180]  As soon as I put them into flower, I was able to reduce my numbers by about 50% because
[23:03.180 --> 23:05.500]  I removed all of the females at this time.
[23:05.500 --> 23:07.940]  I was looking for that golden goat dominant male.
[23:07.940 --> 23:11.300]  I did not want to waste time and space for females, so I narrowed it down.
[23:11.300 --> 23:16.660]  I had a very good selection batch of males to select from.
[23:16.660 --> 23:21.020]  Now I am paying very close attention to this very small number of male plants, and I am
[23:21.020 --> 23:25.980]  setting these plants right next to my golden goat female that is in veg so that I can compare.
[23:25.980 --> 23:27.340]  I'm looking at node spacing.
[23:27.340 --> 23:28.960]  I'm looking at leaf shape.
[23:28.960 --> 23:33.060]  If the leaf shape, I took a leaf off of my golden goat plant that was in veg.
[23:33.100 --> 23:38.220]  I took a leaf off of a golden goat plant that was in flower, and I compared those leaf sizes
[23:38.220 --> 23:42.620]  and shapes to these golden goat males that were potentially going to be used for the
[23:42.620 --> 23:43.620]  bat cross.
[23:43.620 --> 23:47.900]  I'm taking leaves off of the plant that is acceptable, and I'm sizing them up next to
[23:47.900 --> 23:49.700]  the plants that are my potential mates.
[23:49.700 --> 23:53.860]  I'm looking, and I'm saying, no, your leaves are a little bit different, or you're reacting
[23:53.860 --> 23:58.060]  differently to the nutrients, or you're not doing what I want to see golden goat do.
[23:58.060 --> 24:01.980]  I've grown golden goat so much that I know what it does, and I'm looking at these plants,
[24:01.980 --> 24:03.300]  and I'm saying, you're not the one.
[24:03.300 --> 24:04.300]  I can see it.
[24:04.300 --> 24:07.500]  I know you don't perform the way golden goat performs.
[24:07.500 --> 24:08.500]  You got to go.
[24:08.500 --> 24:12.220]  So I'd get rid of these male plants as I saw them, showing me any sign of, hey, I'm not
[24:12.220 --> 24:13.320]  the one.
[24:13.320 --> 24:14.740]  One red flag, it had to go.
[24:14.740 --> 24:16.540]  I need the exact match.
[24:16.540 --> 24:21.420]  That's what I'm looking for because I don't want to make golden goat BX crosses that are
[24:21.420 --> 24:24.880]  mostly golden goat with a little hint of daybreaker in there.
[24:24.880 --> 24:27.060]  There is that opportunity because it is genetics.
[24:27.060 --> 24:31.460]  That is the way nature works, but I did my best to eliminate that opportunity with my
[24:31.940 --> 24:32.940]  selection.
[24:32.940 --> 24:38.740]  So I went as far as to rub the stem of that male plant and smell it with one hand.
[24:38.740 --> 24:41.820]  Then I rubbed the other stem of the other plant with the other hand, and I would hold
[24:41.820 --> 24:46.420]  them to my face and see if they both smelled exactly the same, and I found one.
[24:46.420 --> 24:48.420]  It smelled exactly the same.
[24:48.420 --> 24:50.540]  The node spacing was perfect.
[24:50.540 --> 24:52.700]  The leaf shape was perfect.
[24:52.700 --> 24:57.780]  I got down to the detail of counting the serrations on the leaves.
[24:57.780 --> 24:58.980]  It was a little obsessive.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.300]  It was a little bit crazy.
[25:00.300 --> 25:04.580]  I was a lot of dabs into this project, but I feel like in the end, I did a very good
[25:04.580 --> 25:08.980]  job at selecting the male to use for this golden goat BX project.
[25:08.980 --> 25:13.540]  What tells me that I did a good job at selecting is when I run these golden goat seeds, they
[25:13.540 --> 25:16.660]  look a lot like the clone.
[25:16.660 --> 25:21.460]  90% of them look just like the clone that I've got in my room.
[25:21.460 --> 25:25.860]  If you took that mother plant, you took a clone from it, and then you sprouted 100 of
[25:25.860 --> 25:30.820]  those golden goat seeds, when you eliminate 50 of them for being males, that's going to
[25:30.820 --> 25:36.700]  give you 45 beautiful seedlings that look just like the mother plant of the golden goat
[25:36.700 --> 25:41.660]  clone that I have got that was created from Mr. Dank's seeds in Topeka, Kansas several
[25:41.660 --> 25:43.220]  years ago.
[25:43.220 --> 25:48.260]  That is my story on how I selectively and very carefully made a golden goat BX.
[25:48.260 --> 25:52.060]  That is my story on how I fell in love with golden goat and why I choose to breed with
[25:52.060 --> 25:53.060]  it so much.
[25:53.060 --> 25:54.620]  I think that was a great email.
[25:54.620 --> 25:58.700]  You've asked me not to say your name on the show, but dude, that was a great question.
