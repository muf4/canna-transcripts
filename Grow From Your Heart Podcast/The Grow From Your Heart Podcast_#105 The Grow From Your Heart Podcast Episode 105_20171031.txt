[00:17.470 --> 00:22.050]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 105 of the Grow From
[00:22.050 --> 00:26.890]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[00:26.890 --> 00:31.810]  God, I'm already coughing through the intro. I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[00:31.810 --> 00:35.210]  You guys sitting across the table from me is my good buddy, Will. How you doing, bro?
[00:35.210 --> 00:38.130]  Good, man. How you doing? Dude, I'm doing great. Thanks for joining me. You guys, I
[00:38.130 --> 00:41.490]  apologize for coughing right away on the intro. I blew the intro, but it's all right. We're
[00:41.490 --> 00:45.190]  going to have a great show. You guys, my buddy Will is here. He's a glassblower. He's also
[00:45.190 --> 00:50.130]  known as at barefoot glass on Instagram. Are you on Twitter? Not on Twitter. All right.
[00:50.130 --> 00:52.690]  He's on Instagram. You guys make sure you check him out on Instagram. Go look at his
[00:52.690 --> 00:58.050]  posts while you're listening to this podcast. It's at barefoot glass. He's a, uh, it's kind
[00:58.050 --> 01:01.730]  of an up and coming glass artist. You're kind of a new guy. How long you been going? I started
[01:01.730 --> 01:06.410]  in July. So late July. You're really new there. Coming up on four months. Holy shit. Right
[01:06.410 --> 01:09.450]  on. Well, congratulations. I think you're doing hella good. Well, appreciate it, man.
[01:09.450 --> 01:15.750]  You gave me a, uh, you gave me a dabber several months ago. It is quite, it's taken a couple
[01:15.750 --> 01:19.470]  of tumbles and it has not broken yet. So that's a sign of a glassblower that kind of knows
[01:19.470 --> 01:22.790]  what he's doing. Well, thank you, man. Oh, for sure, man. I appreciate you being on the
[01:22.790 --> 01:26.430]  show. I'm looking for the news article that I had tagged here, but of course, uh, I got
[01:26.430 --> 01:29.990]  refreshed and now it's gone. So it'll come back up here. Yeah, dude. Technically it can
[01:29.990 --> 01:33.830]  be the best and it can be the worst thing on the planet. Well, dude, thanks for coming
[01:33.830 --> 01:37.070]  to the show. I've got a news article. I can't find it on my computer. I'm getting it going
[01:37.070 --> 01:40.610]  here. I promise you, but I don't even need the news article. Talk about it. Something
[01:40.610 --> 01:47.050]  weird happened here recently in Colorado. A Snoop dog has signed a deal with live. Well,
[01:47.050 --> 01:52.210]  a dispensary Hill here in Colorado to produce a strain of cannabis and market this cannabis
[01:52.210 --> 01:56.570]  under the Snoop dog name at live. Well, now that sounds like a really cool thing, but
[01:56.570 --> 02:00.530]  Will's looking at me and shaking his head kind of to the side, kind of like, eh, if
[02:00.530 --> 02:04.410]  you guys have heard the show in the past, we've reported about live. Well, putting a
[02:04.510 --> 02:09.110]  whole bunch of shitty ass pesticides in their cannabis. Uh, if you come to Colorado and
[02:09.110 --> 02:12.910]  you shop at live, well, you'll be disappointed because it's pretty much like going to the
[02:12.910 --> 02:17.710]  shittiest street dealer you can ever find and buying the shittiest dirt weed you can
[02:17.710 --> 02:23.270]  find for way too much money. And it always seems old, like old weed. Yeah. Yeah. And
[02:23.270 --> 02:27.590]  it just old. And it's probably cause they're using pesticides and low quality grow conditions.
[02:27.590 --> 02:31.830]  I've been there a couple of times. Not my cup of tea. Not your cup of tea. Not at all.
[02:31.830 --> 02:36.570]  So I think it's really weird that Snoop has come and done a deal with the shittiest, like
[02:36.570 --> 02:41.690]  they've got the reputation for being the shittiest dispensary in Colorado. Snoop's a publicist
[02:41.690 --> 02:45.530]  or publishing or public people should have done a lot more research on this shit. This
[02:45.530 --> 02:49.730]  is a big fail on Snoop's publicists. I think that's what you call them. Publicists. Publicists.
[02:49.730 --> 02:53.610]  Yeah. It's their fault. That guy failed. They should have done a little more work. Uh, and
[02:53.610 --> 02:57.930]  I'm also curious, I am not a law expert, but Snoop is not a Colorado resident. How was
[02:57.930 --> 03:02.550]  Snoop able to participate in a Colorado cannabis business? I'm very curious about that. So
[03:02.550 --> 03:06.210]  if you guys have some insight on that, Mike, if you're listening, please tweet me or come
[03:06.210 --> 03:09.790]  be on the show and we will talk about how Snoop's able to do this. This is, this is
[03:09.790 --> 03:13.030]  kind of wacky guys. Snoop signed up with the shittiest dispensary here in Colorado. And
[03:13.030 --> 03:17.270]  I'm not just talking shit. Uh, if you're in Colorado and you go to live well and then
[03:17.270 --> 03:21.510]  go to almost any other dispensary, go to the spot dispensary, uh, go to green and healthy
[03:21.510 --> 03:25.790]  wellness. When they reopened here in about two weeks, uh, you will see quality products
[03:25.810 --> 03:30.330]  to live well, very quality. Yeah. Yeah. Green and healthy is only a Terp station is only
[03:30.330 --> 03:33.890]  medical. So I apologize. You gotta be medical. All right. So I wanted to talk about that
[03:33.890 --> 03:38.110]  for a second. We got past the Snoop dog part. We did not even need any help from the news
[03:38.110 --> 03:43.130]  article. Uh, Snoop big fail, bro. If you need some good weed, come hit me up. It'll hook
[03:43.130 --> 03:47.090]  you up with a dispensary and I'll show you how to grow and I'll show you how I grow and
[03:47.090 --> 03:50.290]  we'll produce some quality buds for you. We'll do it. We'll make a strain for you called
[03:50.290 --> 03:55.610]  doggy style. We'll do it. All right. So Will's a glass blower. Let's talk a little bit about
[03:55.630 --> 03:59.230]  blowing glass. Dude, you brought some great looking pieces with you. Appreciate it, man.
[03:59.230 --> 04:02.430]  Uh, the piece right in front of me is, is that called Illuminati or is that this is
[04:02.430 --> 04:07.590]  Haterade Haterade? Oh shit. Yeah. All right. Very specific. Okay. That's a good, that's
[04:07.590 --> 04:11.510]  a good random question. Where did these names come from? The glass net, the color of the
[04:11.510 --> 04:15.230]  glass. Yeah. Whoever the company that makes it or the person that pulls it. Okay. Each
[04:15.230 --> 04:22.230]  one. Um, there's like glass alchemy, mountain glass arts, uh, and then taffy tubes, uh,
[04:22.410 --> 04:26.290]  D and L borough here in Denver. Okay. Um, just a bunch of different companies that pull
[04:26.290 --> 04:29.730]  different colors and they name it whatever they want. There's a few that go across the
[04:29.730 --> 04:33.770]  board like blue stardust is one that every company most likely has. Okay. But then there's
[04:33.770 --> 04:37.970]  a few, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but that are just specifically a
[04:37.970 --> 04:42.690]  company made them. Okay. So is this a common color or is this, it's a pretty common one.
[04:42.690 --> 04:47.490]  Yeah. All right. So what's the difference between Haterade, slime and Illuminati? Illuminati
[04:47.490 --> 04:51.530]  is UV reactive. Illuminati looks just like Haterade pretty much a little bit more on
[04:51.550 --> 04:56.230]  the yellow side probably, but it's UV reactive. So when you hit it with the UV light, it glows.
[04:56.230 --> 04:59.950]  It's pretty neat. I've got a little Pendy from shout out to ghost cat glass with some
[04:59.950 --> 05:05.910]  UV in it. All right. And then slime of course is a little, it's not, it's not as a transparent
[05:05.910 --> 05:09.590]  as a little more opaque. It's got a little bit of white in it sometimes depending on
[05:09.590 --> 05:12.630]  how you stretch it and pull it. But yeah, so you guys were already learning. We learned
[05:12.630 --> 05:16.070]  the difference. Illuminati glass is really cool. You guys, it's real hip. If you're not,
[05:16.070 --> 05:18.790]  if you're not in the glass scene, this, some of this episode may go over your head, but
[05:18.790 --> 05:22.650]  you're going to learn a whole bunch today. The glass scene has got its own scene happening
[05:22.650 --> 05:27.930]  here in Colorado. It's got its own glass scene in California. It's everywhere. Florida. Yeah.
[05:27.930 --> 05:31.230]  The East coast has got a glass scene popping up. It's everywhere. They're now glass galleries
[05:31.230 --> 05:35.170]  all over the place. It's really funny. I go to glass events and I don't even, uh, will
[05:35.170 --> 05:38.750]  and I hang out. Uh, we are friends through the garden of weed and we don't really hang
[05:38.750 --> 05:44.090]  out in, uh, on our own, but we always bump into each other at, uh, illusions, glass galleries.
[05:44.090 --> 05:48.630]  We ran into each other at champs. All the who's calling, you know, Mattie good. What
[05:48.630 --> 05:52.350]  up miss Maddie? Shut up. That's the best person that could call right now. Hey Maddie, come
[05:52.350 --> 05:55.850]  be on the podcast again. We get so many listens when you're here, but we run into each other
[05:55.850 --> 05:59.690]  at glass places, glass events all the time. So we're both huge glass enthusiasts, which
[05:59.690 --> 06:03.730]  is kind of great. So does this rig have a name? Who blew this one? Uh, this is whitey
[06:03.730 --> 06:07.690]  glass. Whitey glass. Yeah. Whitey glass is his name. I don't know his actual name. You're
[06:07.690 --> 06:11.010]  going to bet about that, but whitey glasses, Instagram, whitey. I don't even know there's
[06:11.010 --> 06:14.090]  an underscore or anything, but if you look up whitey glass, you'll find him. He's real
[06:14.090 --> 06:17.370]  good. He's killing the client. Maybe you'll see this client game. Yeah. So these pieces
[06:17.370 --> 06:20.490]  with this weird spout on the back, that's called the client. Yeah, this is a client.
[06:20.490 --> 06:25.050]  Client is like a recycler. It's the new kind of cool recycler that everyone's liking. Um,
[06:25.050 --> 06:29.650]  as opposed to the old triangular shape, shape, cycle, it's, it's more of an internal one.
[06:29.650 --> 06:33.170]  Um, even though it's not technically internal with the drains and the drain in the back,
[06:33.170 --> 06:36.330]  everything, I really liked the way those types of rigs hit. I've got a little client and
[06:36.330 --> 06:39.370]  yeah, I love the way that they're awesome. They're awesome. All right. So shout out to
[06:39.530 --> 06:43.050]  whitey glass. That's a sexy piece, dude. Tell me more about this rubber ducky looking.
[06:44.170 --> 06:49.450]  This little birdie right here. This is a calm birdling. Uh, this is number 38 in the series.
[06:49.450 --> 06:53.930]  Um, just kind of a little of how many I'm not sure on that. What I want to say, um,
[06:53.930 --> 07:00.010]  I don't know. I've got number 38. Um, it came with a little tin that you can see over there.
[07:00.010 --> 07:03.850]  It's like got a little drawing on the top of it signed and everything. That's fresh. Yeah. It's
[07:03.850 --> 07:08.250]  pretty cool. But, uh, yeah, it's a little series. Calvin Mickels or Calvin Mickel is his name.
[07:08.250 --> 07:14.650]  Uh, calm combo on Instagram. Oh, I follow combo. Yeah. Yeah. He makes really cool birds. This is
[07:14.650 --> 07:18.650]  more of one of the simpler ones, kind of a production series. So it's kind of a puck type
[07:18.650 --> 07:24.730]  base, which is hollow and functional. That's where the perk is sitting. He's got a donut,
[07:24.730 --> 07:31.610]  which functions as the, basically the head of the bird. It's got a beak. Uh, what color is the beak?
[07:31.610 --> 07:34.810]  The beak looks like green starters. I think it's what the green start us. All right. And then he's
[07:34.810 --> 07:38.730]  got a couple of white wings that are attached to the base. And then, uh, you got a little
[07:38.730 --> 07:43.130]  club banger on there. Yeah. Just a little, uh, I get this delusions. Nice. Yeah. A little,
[07:43.130 --> 07:46.250]  little banger, little courts banger. We're going to talk more about the bangers here in just a few
[07:46.250 --> 07:51.850]  minutes. One of my notes is all about the banger. Um, remind me the artist on that one. That is a
[07:51.850 --> 07:55.370]  calm combo combo. All right. So shout out to combo glass. You guys make sure you check out
[07:55.370 --> 07:58.170]  all these artists on Instagram. We're going to talk a lot about artists. Make sure you go check
[07:58.170 --> 08:01.610]  them out. I'll list off some of my favorite artists towards the end of the episode. I'm going
[08:01.610 --> 08:05.930]  to ask Will some of his favorites also. So we will definitely give you some shit to look at.
[08:06.410 --> 08:11.450]  Uh, so next up is a glorious piece with, what is this piece here on the front called this?
[08:11.450 --> 08:15.930]  This is called, it would be called a cab when it's connected like this. All right. Um, it's a little
[08:15.930 --> 08:23.370]  Dyke row, Iguana cab. Uh, this piece is made by a mongrel glass. Okay. Jack, uh, Jack is his name,
[08:23.370 --> 08:27.690]  Jack Albershark. Good. A good friend of mine from actually back in North Carolina. Um,
[08:27.690 --> 08:31.530]  shout out to North Carolina. So there are people left. You guys didn't bring everybody from North
[08:31.530 --> 08:36.650]  Carolina out. No, he's out here. He lives out here. You guys, that's funny because Maddie and
[08:36.650 --> 08:41.130]  Spence moved out here close to two years ago. And then everybody else from the town of Dixie came
[08:41.130 --> 08:45.210]  out here and then all of the surrounding areas, all the cool stoners are just moving to Colorado.
[08:45.210 --> 08:49.450]  Everybody from North Carolina is coming out here and it's really funny to see, but I love it. You
[08:49.450 --> 08:54.330]  guys are so good. The North Carolina people are some of my favorite friends. They're a different
[08:54.330 --> 08:58.490]  breed of folk. They're more open. They're kinder. They're more polite. They got more time. Yeah.
[08:58.490 --> 09:01.850]  We've got that Southern charm, but not that Southern, I don't know.
[09:03.450 --> 09:07.370]  Without the trailer park. Exactly. Exactly. I can say that because I'm not one. Exactly. There you
[09:07.370 --> 09:11.130]  go. I see it. Yeah, it's awesome. All right. Let's do this piece. What is going on with the
[09:11.130 --> 09:15.690]  piece of your time? This is a lot. This is one of my favorites. This is called the Safari special.
[09:16.570 --> 09:20.490]  It's a really big, really big base with a tiny little mouthpiece. It's got the tiny little.
[09:20.490 --> 09:25.690]  Okay. That is pretty tiny. We'll try it out in a minute. Oh yeah. He did. It's like,
[09:25.690 --> 09:28.730]  it's kind of hard to talk about it over the microphone without you people seeing it,
[09:28.730 --> 09:34.810]  but it's got this giant basically showerhead perk in it. It's got like seven holes. It frothing.
[09:36.650 --> 09:41.450]  Oh, they can hear that. Yeah. Yeah. It's got a nice function. A couple of leafs on the inside
[09:41.450 --> 09:46.650]  with some flower implosions attached to the perk. It looks like somewhere that Ariel,
[09:46.650 --> 09:50.570]  the little mermaid we want to kick. Exactly. It totally looks like it's got some, uh,
[09:51.370 --> 09:56.490]  so it, this is this a banger hanger. Would this officially be called? I would call a banger.
[09:56.490 --> 09:59.770]  Okay. All right. While we're on that subject about banger hangers, I want to give us another
[09:59.770 --> 10:04.890]  shout out to a mongrel glass here. Cause he was one of the first, in my opinion, to start using
[10:04.890 --> 10:08.810]  this. And he even posted about it a while ago. It was when, before even bangers were a thing,
[10:08.810 --> 10:13.210]  it was emails. Uh, when emails were a big thing, he was one of the first people to start going back
[10:13.210 --> 10:17.370]  to the original female joint as opposed to the male joint that people were using for dabbing.
[10:17.370 --> 10:23.370]  Um, cause he noticed the trend of people using, uh, attachments and, uh, drop downs and everything.
[10:23.370 --> 10:27.210]  So he, I remember him making a post about it and everything about, you know, I'm thinking about
[10:27.210 --> 10:31.050]  making the transition back to just this blah, blah, blah. And he was one of the first people
[10:31.050 --> 10:35.370]  in my opinion to really, you know, I was confused when I first saw him going back to the female
[10:35.370 --> 10:38.650]  joints. I was like, what's happening here. How do I put my nail in this bitch now? Like this
[10:38.650 --> 10:42.410]  is new. And when I saw the bangers, uh, the club bangers, we're going to have to talk about
[10:42.410 --> 10:46.490]  bangers in a minute. We're going to have to define those. What's a bang? What are they talking about?
[10:47.770 --> 10:51.370]  I wrote down the word banger just so we remember to talk about that a little bit.
[10:51.370 --> 10:53.850]  So this piece we're talking about, you guys, I know we've been talking about this piece for a
[10:53.850 --> 10:57.770]  long time. It's got a really fat base and then it's got, what'd you call this one again? Cab
[10:57.770 --> 11:03.690]  Dicro Dicro cab with an iguana, a molt, super colorful iguana on the front seat of life in the
[11:03.690 --> 11:08.810]  back of the seat of life, uh, sacred geometry in the background. Then when you spin it around in
[11:08.810 --> 11:13.050]  the back, there's like a mid with a flower and two leaves around it. And then it seals up and
[11:13.050 --> 11:18.410]  coming out of the clear sealed part is three pieces of bamboo, the taller pieces, the mouthpiece.
[11:18.410 --> 11:22.890]  And then it's got two beautifully detailed leaves. Oh, just one, one beautifully detailed
[11:22.890 --> 11:26.730]  leaf coming up the side. Uh, it's a pretty fresh looking piece. That's, that's a really stylish
[11:26.730 --> 11:30.330]  looking rig. Yeah. It's one of my favorites for sure. I can see why. Yeah. Does it hit well with
[11:30.330 --> 11:34.090]  that skinny mouthpiece? Oh yeah. Phenomenally cool. Phenomenally. I heard you pull on it. It
[11:34.090 --> 11:39.530]  sounds like a champ. All right. So we got to give shout outs to Mongrel to Combo and I forgot this
[11:39.530 --> 11:43.610]  guy Whitey. Whitey Glass. How do I forget Whitey Glass? People have called me Whitey all the time.
[11:44.650 --> 11:47.930]  All right. I'm writing these names down so that we can give a huge shout out at the end and make
[11:47.930 --> 11:52.010]  sure all these glassblowers get a bunch of love. Nice. All right. So, uh, are these three of your
[11:52.010 --> 11:56.250]  favorites? In my collection? Yeah. Oh yeah. These are probably three of my favorites in my collection
[11:56.490 --> 12:02.330]  I've got a couple more Kleins. I've got a couple more pieces by him. Um, I've got the Wyoming
[12:02.330 --> 12:06.090]  Angler, but these are like my daily drivers for sure. You've got that one of the Anglers. Yeah.
[12:06.090 --> 12:10.570]  You guys check those out on Instagram. Those are crazy. Some of the teeth make me nervous about
[12:10.570 --> 12:14.410]  them. They're sharp. Yeah. You can just bust those off and it scares me. I work with more of the
[12:14.410 --> 12:19.210]  functional clear prototype glass for myself. It's more my thing. Uh, so since we're talking about
[12:19.210 --> 12:22.410]  your glass, I'm going to brag about my new rig. I've got this, a Hitman over here. It's actually
[12:22.410 --> 12:28.010]  a Hitman Samson collab. Uh, it's got basic Hitman. Yeah. Yeah. It's got a basic Hitman sidecar
[12:28.010 --> 12:32.010]  design, but then it's got this sweet grow. What do you call that color? Greenish turquoise blue.
[12:32.010 --> 12:35.850]  That's a nice, like a nice mix. It looks like a custom, custom pool to be honest. Definitely
[12:35.850 --> 12:39.370]  a custom sort of things. I've never seen anything like that. So that's, that's the one I've been
[12:39.370 --> 12:43.290]  pulling on lately. I really love that rig. So shout out to Hitman glass, shout out to Dougie.
[12:43.290 --> 12:48.650]  Uh, I like the clear glass that's made by, uh, like a, like a brand that's known like Hitman
[12:48.650 --> 12:54.010]  because I have nothing against these rigs, but when you buy one of these, the function sometimes
[12:54.010 --> 12:58.650]  is questionable. Definitely. I've seen friends of ours spend thousands of dollars on a rig.
[12:58.650 --> 13:03.450]  And if you put four milliliters, too much water in it, you're going to get in your mouth. And if
[13:03.450 --> 13:08.170]  you put five milliliters too short, you get a dry dab and you choke for days. And I love that
[13:08.170 --> 13:12.170]  these production rigs that are made the same all the time. I love that. I know what I'm getting
[13:12.170 --> 13:16.970]  when I buy them. And if I break it, I can, I don't want to break it, but if I do, I can replace that
[13:16.970 --> 13:21.930]  fairly easily. Just go to the Hitman store, which is illusions around here and just go grab one off
[13:21.930 --> 13:25.690]  the shelf. Exactly. You're not out a thousand dollars. Right. Right. And if you break this,
[13:25.690 --> 13:30.490]  this is artwork. I mean, this is art as well, but this is, this took much. This is a proto artwork.
[13:30.490 --> 13:35.370]  This one, this is a only one, the only safari special that's out there. It's gorgeous. It is
[13:35.370 --> 13:39.290]  gorgeous. That's a great piece. You guys all take a picture of it and I'll put it on my Instagram.
[13:39.290 --> 13:43.370]  I just promised that. So I have to do it, which means you guys need to check out my Instagram.
[13:43.370 --> 13:48.330]  I'm writing down Insta. So you guys got to check out my Instagram at I read genetics. There are
[13:48.330 --> 13:54.410]  pictures of these rigs on there. Why am I ringing? That's so weird that the Mac book is ringing. We're
[13:54.410 --> 13:59.530]  just going to decline that shit. All right. So if you're on a podcast, put all your shit on airplane
[13:59.530 --> 14:04.810]  mode. That's that's my advice to you. Uh, where the shits were. Why I was talking about rigs,
[14:04.810 --> 14:08.010]  right? All right, dude, right on for bringing thousands of dollars worth of glass to the table.
[14:08.010 --> 14:10.250]  That is freaking awesome. We're gonna have to grab a torture in just a second.
[14:11.210 --> 14:16.730]  Bangers. Let's talk about the banger. So everybody, I talk about dabbing off the nail. You guys, I
[14:16.730 --> 14:21.850]  like the nail because I can hook the titanium nail up to the email. The nails that I use are usually
[14:21.850 --> 14:26.970]  titanium. They go onto a male joint that points up. You drop the nail onto there or you put your
[14:26.970 --> 14:32.970]  other dome type nail inside there. Like our buddy was talking about, this dude decided to flip back
[14:32.970 --> 14:38.650]  to the female joint because he saw the trend of accessories and what we're calling bangers coming
[14:38.650 --> 14:43.610]  out. So there's a guy, everyone calls him quave, but I think it's actually pronounced quav.
[14:43.610 --> 14:47.450]  Yeah. I don't, I'm not even sure it's where I go back and forth on it. Honestly, potato,
[14:47.450 --> 14:52.090]  potato type depends on how I hear you say it. How I say it in the conversation. It's like the truth.
[14:52.090 --> 14:56.730]  So a quave is more comfortable. Quav sounds a little fancier. A little weird. Yeah. Yeah.
[14:56.730 --> 15:01.450]  Uh, so anyway, there was a guy named quav who made, uh, what we call the banger. It's got a
[15:01.450 --> 15:07.050]  male joint that goes into your rig. That's got a female joint and then it comes straight up and
[15:07.050 --> 15:10.410]  then it curves out to, there are multiple different angles available. You can get it at 90
[15:10.410 --> 15:17.690]  or 45, uh, probably other angles as well, but then it's got just a basic, it looks like a small, uh,
[15:17.690 --> 15:22.330]  it looks like the lid to your chapstick basically. Oh, good. Nice. That's exactly what it looks like.
[15:22.330 --> 15:28.090]  Oh yeah. But it's clear it's made out of quartz. And so you heat that shit up and then you let it
[15:28.090 --> 15:32.010]  cool and then you drop your dab in there. And the theory, and I believe it is that the quartz is
[15:32.010 --> 15:38.490]  giving a much cleaner, more flavorful hit from your dab compared to the titanium. And I really
[15:38.490 --> 15:43.690]  agree with it. Uh, my problem is I'm a little clumsy and I would, I'm going to break that and
[15:43.690 --> 15:46.810]  you got to keep that a little bit cleaner. It's a little more high maintenance, definitely more
[15:46.810 --> 15:51.690]  high maintenance having the banger, um, with the tie, you know, you can get it real dirty and then
[15:51.690 --> 15:56.410]  just get it hot and hit it with a, um, one of those little brushes for the grill, even almost
[15:56.410 --> 16:00.330]  as little steel wool, steel wool type things and get it fresh and clean. But with the banger, once
[16:00.330 --> 16:04.650]  it gets dirty, it's a, it's dirty. And if you want to keep it clean, you got to do the, uh,
[16:04.650 --> 16:08.570]  you just got to keep Q-tipping it every day for every use and all that stuff. Yeah. He did it all
[16:08.570 --> 16:12.970]  the time. Q-tip tech. You want to go down that route? Oh, we can talk about the Q-tip tech.
[16:12.970 --> 16:17.530]  Are they ready for the Q-tip tech yet? All right. Well, Q-tip tech, since we're on, so that's a
[16:17.530 --> 16:21.050]  banger, you guys, basically a banger is made out of quartz. A lot of them are made out of glass.
[16:21.050 --> 16:24.490]  I don't see a problem with dabbing out of the glass piece, but it's not going to taste as good.
[16:24.490 --> 16:27.610]  It's not going to last as long. It's going to break after heating and cooling so long. The
[16:27.610 --> 16:31.130]  quartz is better quality. If you're going to use anything, quartz or tie, definitely one of the
[16:31.130 --> 16:34.970]  two. Yeah. And if you're going to try, maybe ceramic, uh, the Halen honey holes are great.
[16:34.970 --> 16:38.650]  If you're going for something made out of quartz, uh, the Halen troughs are amazing. Those are
[16:38.650 --> 16:43.450]  awesome. Uh, the co-op banger, the banger knockoffs are cool. If you trust your artist and your vendor
[16:43.450 --> 16:47.370]  trust where your stuff is coming from, try not to buy China. That's where I was heading up. No
[16:47.370 --> 16:52.010]  China glass. It's made by little kids that aren't using proper protection. Is there a difference in
[16:52.010 --> 16:56.890]  the glass? Um, it's really hard to tell, but yeah, there is definitely a difference in there's
[16:56.890 --> 17:00.650]  quartz qualities and the Chinese manufacturers are definitely going to be using much lower
[17:00.650 --> 17:04.170]  quality courts as cheap as they can find, as cheap as they can find, because it's just some
[17:04.170 --> 17:09.770]  douche over here trying to make money, uh, just exploiting the market. Right. Um, and, uh,
[17:09.770 --> 17:13.930]  you're definitely going to find lower grade Chinese made courts is going to be much lower grade than
[17:13.930 --> 17:18.330]  American made, just like titanium. Exactly. You guys, I know we sound like a bunch of snobby
[17:18.330 --> 17:22.090]  douches when we talk about getting a quality nail, but that's your health. You're heating this
[17:22.090 --> 17:26.570]  product up to, I don't even know how many degrees, how to have to burn the shit out of yourself.
[17:26.570 --> 17:29.850]  And you're putting your medicine on there. You're putting your hash on there and you're
[17:29.850 --> 17:34.570]  smoking directly into your lungs. So whatever's in that you're, you're going to dab it. If it's
[17:34.570 --> 17:38.730]  something that puts off some sort of gas or has an oil on it or some kind of shit, you're going
[17:38.730 --> 17:43.370]  to dab that right along with your Earl. So get a quality nail. That's super important to me.
[17:43.370 --> 17:48.090]  Definitely. Yeah. So Q-tip tech, Q-tip after you're done dabbing with your banger, you got to
[17:48.090 --> 17:52.570]  heat that bitch up and clean it out with a Q-tip, right? You don't even heat it to the, in theory is
[17:52.570 --> 17:56.410]  that if you get the good, you get a good temperature where it's not too hot. So you're
[17:56.410 --> 18:00.250]  done dabbing, you get your good temperature. You got to do it pretty much immediately after you
[18:00.250 --> 18:03.610]  grab a Q-tip, you wipe the inside. There should be like a little bit of a, not a puddle, but some
[18:03.610 --> 18:07.050]  wetness in there. You get it quick enough. It'll clean it out. Look good as new. You're good to go.
[18:07.050 --> 18:10.970]  You don't even got to heat it up. Um, like this nail, for example, I was, I was trying to do it.
[18:10.970 --> 18:14.970]  This is the nail is a couple of weeks old now, but you know, it still looks pretty decent. Yeah,
[18:14.970 --> 18:19.290]  I see it working. Um, but on this one you can see I haven't done the Q-tip tech as well. And it's
[18:19.610 --> 18:23.370]  the darkness, but it's going to look at she exactly. All right. So keep it clean. That's
[18:23.370 --> 18:26.650]  kind of what you're saying. Yeah. That's why Spence is always in there heating that shit,
[18:26.650 --> 18:29.530]  right? Yeah. Cause if you take it down and you can heat it up right after you dab that'll work
[18:29.530 --> 18:33.770]  too, but that's not gonna, that's also gonna like burn it and heat it. Like it burns it a little
[18:33.770 --> 18:38.410]  bit. So the Q-tip tech is definitely like the ideal, I guess it's just, it's definitely catching
[18:38.410 --> 18:42.090]  on. And I saw you saying something on Facebook about Q-tip tech, the Q-tip tech. I don't have
[18:42.090 --> 18:47.450]  a problem with the Q-tip tech. It's these new Q-tip holders is what I find hilarious. $300
[18:47.530 --> 18:52.890]  glass Q-tip holders. There's, there's some janky ones that you'll see go on for like $150. And
[18:52.890 --> 18:57.050]  it's literally, it's literally a shot glass for you people at home. It's a shot glass that a
[18:57.050 --> 19:01.370]  glass blower made and put some color on. And some of these guys are putting absolutely no time into
[19:01.370 --> 19:05.690]  it. You can tell, and they put them up for auctions and they go for like 150. There was one,
[19:05.690 --> 19:11.290]  I will say the one that started the whole hype on it was a, a two stroke and sleek collab that
[19:11.290 --> 19:15.850]  they posted. And I think they kind of posted it as a joke originally. And then they, and then they
[19:15.850 --> 19:20.090]  got a ton of hype behind it. And so they decided to auction it off and they went for $2,200.
[19:20.090 --> 19:24.730]  Holy shit. And I'm not, don't get me wrong. I mean, this shit was amazing. These two stroke
[19:24.730 --> 19:28.650]  and sleek are phenomenal glass artists and their work goes, I mean, their work is expensive, but
[19:29.210 --> 19:32.250]  at the end of the day, it was, it was a shot glass Q-tip holders. What they were selling
[19:32.250 --> 19:37.370]  is a thing to hold Q-tips, you know what I'm saying? And yeah, you can dab. Exactly. But,
[19:37.930 --> 19:41.850]  but this whole Q-tip holder thing blew up overnight and it's insane. You can do something
[19:41.850 --> 19:46.410]  with that kind of money. You can do a lot of stuff. You can change communities with $22,000.
[19:46.410 --> 19:51.210]  No, 2200. 22. Okay. Yeah. 22,000. Does that be insane? 2200 though. You can still change.
[19:51.210 --> 19:53.530]  Still 2200 is. 2200 to change your day. Oh,
[19:53.530 --> 19:57.690]  2200 will change a week. A lot of people listening right now that would fix their whole damn car.
[19:57.690 --> 20:00.970]  Your car would not be falling apart. If I had 2200, I'd be straight right now.
[20:00.970 --> 20:08.170]  Right. Oh yeah. I'm doing okay. And I'd take 2300. Damn. All right. So how long ago did you make
[20:08.170 --> 20:12.970]  your first Q-tip holder before it got popular? I honestly, like I didn't make it as a Q-tip
[20:12.970 --> 20:17.290]  holder when I first started, uh, probably one of my first after a month about being on the torch,
[20:17.290 --> 20:21.050]  I was working with shaping to make mini tubes and I started making shot glasses,
[20:21.050 --> 20:24.970]  slash little nug jar things. That was what we, what I was calling them. And my shopmate was
[20:24.970 --> 20:29.210]  calling them as again, nug jars, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Which is what they are. Um, and then I took
[20:29.210 --> 20:33.130]  it home and I was like, Oh look, I can put Q-tips in these. Ha ha. It's a Q-tip holder. It's a
[20:33.130 --> 20:36.650]  heady Q-tip holder. And I had a buddy come in town and I was showing him, I was like, Hey dude,
[20:36.650 --> 20:41.130]  how do you Q-tip holder? Ha ha. And we joked about it. And this was a solid two months ago,
[20:41.130 --> 20:44.810]  maybe a month and a half even like a, and I have a, there's a picture on my Instagram,
[20:44.810 --> 20:49.210]  five weeks old on my Instagram. You can see it on the table. It's I'm not lying. I'm not trying to
[20:49.210 --> 20:53.770]  be that guy, but you know, um, and uh, we, me and my buddy joked about it like, Oh, that's so stupid.
[20:53.770 --> 20:56.730]  Like, ha ha. Like heady Q-tip holder that would never sell. Like, that's just another, like,
[20:56.730 --> 21:02.250]  if it did, ha ha. And sure as shit, here we are a month and a half later with $2,200 Q-tip holders.
[21:02.730 --> 21:07.770]  Talking about it on the podcast. God, but whatever. Yeah. Well now you could still make
[21:07.770 --> 21:12.010]  them. Yeah. I mean, people are doing it. I just, I hate jumping on the hype train like that. I'm
[21:12.010 --> 21:19.290]  just, I'm just not, I don't like doing that. And yeah, but it's whatever hashtag Q-tip tech hashtag
[21:19.290 --> 21:25.450]  Q-tip holder tech, $2,200. Oh man. You guys are gonna have to go YouTube and, and uh, Instagram
[21:25.450 --> 21:31.130]  and so much shit after this. So much stuff. All right. So we talked about Q-tip tech. Uh,
[21:31.130 --> 21:34.650]  I should've asked you way long time ago, but the conversation was fun. Who are some of the
[21:34.650 --> 21:38.810]  glassblowers that inspired you? They got you into glassblowing. Uh, this guy right here,
[21:38.810 --> 21:44.650]  Mongo Glass. Okay. Definitely like my biggest, he was my biggest help getting involved in everything.
[21:44.650 --> 21:46.970]  So you know him personally and you can't be with him? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. We're from where, uh,
[21:46.970 --> 21:51.610]  he went to high school and we didn't go to the same high school, but we are in the same County
[21:51.610 --> 21:55.290]  and I had a lot of mutual friends in high school. Didn't know each other in high school. We both
[21:55.290 --> 21:59.210]  ended up living in Asheville after high school and I hit him up cause I knew he was blowing glass.
[21:59.210 --> 22:02.890]  And I was like, Hey man, I'd love to come check out the studio. Would it be cool? You know, blah,
[22:02.890 --> 22:05.850]  blah, blah. And he was like, yeah, sure. Went down to the studio a couple of times, hung out with
[22:05.850 --> 22:08.650]  him, hung out with him at his house a couple of times, you know, got to become pretty decent
[22:08.650 --> 22:13.210]  friends with him. Um, bought some glass from him and then he ended up moving out to Gunnison,
[22:13.210 --> 22:18.570]  uh, to work with, uh, Brian's don't know his last name, Berserker glass is a Berserker glass.
[22:18.570 --> 22:22.650]  So he was working with Berserker, um, who's phenomenal and he's, he's a beast. You guys
[22:22.650 --> 22:26.730]  definitely got to look up Berserker. Um, check out the dogs that he makes, the balloon animals.
[22:27.530 --> 22:30.890]  That's Blitzkrieg. Oh, Blitzkrieg. Fuck. You're right. Really close. My bad. Yeah. It's okay.
[22:30.890 --> 22:36.570]  It's same Blitzkrieg, Berserker. Yeah. Yeah. Bees and crazy noises. But, uh, he, uh, Jack showed me
[22:36.570 --> 22:39.530]  a bunch of things on the torch a couple of years ago. It's about probably three or four years ago
[22:39.530 --> 22:44.090]  now, I guess. Um, kept in touch with him over the years and then I wanted to start doing it and he
[22:44.090 --> 22:47.690]  gave me all the information I needed to do. He's let me come out to his studio here,
[22:47.690 --> 22:51.770]  check him out. Um, so he's definitely my biggest, he sold me my first torch actually.
[22:51.770 --> 22:56.490]  Nice. Um, biggest, he was definitely my biggest help getting into glass blowing. And as far as
[22:56.490 --> 23:01.450]  guys that like, you know, inspire me and motivate me and everything. I mean, you seen, uh, you seen
[23:01.450 --> 23:06.410]  goings, he's definitely, he's phenomenal. He's one of my favorites. Uh, calm right here. Uh,
[23:06.410 --> 23:09.530]  definitely one of my favorite like sculpture artists, or I guess he's sort of sculptural
[23:09.530 --> 23:13.850]  artists, but, uh, his birds are just phenomenal. I love him. Um, I was real big into elbow for a
[23:13.850 --> 23:18.570]  while. Uh, when the elbow, I mean, I was on the elbow bubble for a while, but then everybody was,
[23:18.570 --> 23:22.010]  everybody was as huge and it definitely, I don't want to say it popped, but it definitely
[23:22.010 --> 23:26.970]  deflated a little bit. Um, uh, salt, of course he was one of my favorites back in the day.
[23:26.970 --> 23:32.250]  You guys check out salt. That's some crazy dirty shit. Yeah. Yeah. And then, um, one of the, uh,
[23:32.250 --> 23:37.210]  with the books, um, I guess you cannot remember the name of them right now. I'm tripping, slipping
[23:37.210 --> 23:42.650]  these two books there. Uh, yeah, it was really before glass was a thing that he just smoked,
[23:42.650 --> 23:46.890]  smoked out, smoked volume one and two. Um, their books full of glass artists and everything. And
[23:46.890 --> 23:51.130]  it was before there was really a glass scene type of thing. It was just kind of like, this was how
[23:51.130 --> 23:55.210]  you found, there was no Instagram. This was like, these were the heady artists at the time. And
[23:55.210 --> 23:59.130]  anybody in that book too. I can't really remember anyone specific cause it was a while ago, but that
[23:59.130 --> 24:02.970]  those books, um, definitely were like, Whoa, this is kind of sparked you a little bit stuck in your
[24:02.970 --> 24:08.250]  mind. All right. Yeah. All right. And, um, degenerate art, the documentary, that was the
[24:08.250 --> 24:13.130]  biggest, I think I watched that my freshman year in college and I was already into glass. That's
[24:13.130 --> 24:16.890]  what we watched it, but we were more into me and my roommate had a bunch of roars. Um, we had like
[24:16.890 --> 24:24.650]  roars and 51 50 AMG straight tube rippers. Yeah, exactly what it was. And then we were like, Oh
[24:24.650 --> 24:28.570]  dude, there's this movie about glass on here. Let's watch it. And, uh, that movie, honestly,
[24:28.570 --> 24:32.010]  I would say like, I mean, like changed my life. It opened me up to my eyes to the scene of glass
[24:32.010 --> 24:36.890]  that I had no idea even existed. I was like, Holy hell, this is crazy. Like this is nuts.
[24:36.890 --> 24:41.530]  Did you get to meet Bob Snodgrass at champs? I did meet Bob Snodgrass. That was really cool for me.
[24:42.250 --> 24:49.050]  Shout out Bob Snodgrass, man. He's the man. He's the, the OG godfather of modern day glass
[24:49.050 --> 24:53.530]  blowing for sure. You kind of did it on accident too. If you know how he did it. Yeah. It's crazy.
[24:53.530 --> 24:58.730]  Yeah. Definitely check out degenerate art. If you have any, any interest in glass or art or
[24:58.730 --> 25:03.690]  just culture in general, any culture, it's just a really, it's just a great, great film. If you're
[25:03.690 --> 25:07.130]  into cannabis culture and you're looking for something that you want to watch, that's not just
[25:07.130 --> 25:10.650]  we like if your girlfriend's coming over and you want to watch something else, that's a good one to
[25:10.650 --> 25:14.650]  watch. It might be entertained by that too. It's not just another weed movie. It's awesome. And
[25:14.650 --> 25:18.250]  it's really cool with that one. Cause that was only four years ago that that documentary was
[25:18.250 --> 25:24.570]  like produced and made and let out. And it's just crazy to see how far the glass industry and the
[25:24.570 --> 25:30.890]  market has come from 2011 to 2015, where in 2011, you know, kind of this underground scene that like,
[25:30.890 --> 25:34.650]  right. There was nothing on it really until this documentary came out. And then, you know,
[25:34.650 --> 25:38.570]  like at the time in the documentary, I believe Scott Deppie, his most expensive piece at the time
[25:38.570 --> 25:44.170]  was $18,000. And like, that's, that's a crazy amount of money obviously for a piece. But now
[25:44.170 --> 25:48.810]  Scott Deppie is selling pieces for, I mean, 18 to 23,000 is, I mean, that's nothing these days.
[25:48.810 --> 25:53.050]  That's every day. Yeah. He's got a hundred thousand dollar pieces going out. So, so what I wanted to
[25:53.050 --> 25:57.050]  ask you, what makes the market do that kind of shit? What makes an artist and the market jump
[25:57.050 --> 26:02.410]  up and down? And then like we said earlier, Elbow, the guy that makes the dino rigs, he shot up huge
[26:02.410 --> 26:07.370]  for a little while. And then one day everyone's just selling their elbows on Instagram for stupid
[26:07.370 --> 26:11.530]  cheap. What makes shit go like that in the glass market? Well, I definitely think what happened,
[26:11.530 --> 26:14.490]  what Instagram definitely helps. I mean, Instagram is a huge part of like,
[26:15.210 --> 26:21.610]  who's doing, you know, what's who's what in the glass world, I guess. If they've got, you know,
[26:21.610 --> 26:25.450]  lots of followers on there, people are going to think they're like oil brothers, for example,
[26:25.450 --> 26:29.930]  Matt Bowlin. He's a, he's good. He's really good. But his first rig that he put up for sale,
[26:30.810 --> 26:35.130]  it was a little coil pot of green mini rig and it sold for like $800 at auction. And it was like
[26:35.130 --> 26:39.930]  his first rig that he ever sold just because, yeah, it was a hype thing. But I guess with the
[26:39.930 --> 26:44.490]  market, what happened was like everybody all of a sudden started getting into it and it built
[26:44.490 --> 26:48.570]  really fast. Like it went from nothing to something like in a year, mothership prices were
[26:48.570 --> 26:53.850]  quadrupling just because I really don't know what it was. It just be kind of like people started
[26:53.850 --> 26:57.930]  finding out about it. I guess it wasn't all of a sudden an underground thing that it was like,
[26:57.930 --> 27:01.370]  you know, people had Instagrams, they get to show their stuff. So people were buying more stuff.
[27:01.850 --> 27:05.850]  And then everyone, when the market peaked, everyone was like, Oh man, like kind of like
[27:05.850 --> 27:09.290]  a stock market almost. It's like a stock market crash. If you want to think about it like that,
[27:09.290 --> 27:12.330]  where, you know, everyone's like, Oh God, I got to sell, sell, sell, buy, buy, buy.
[27:12.330 --> 27:12.890]  Right. Yeah.
[27:12.890 --> 27:16.650]  And you know, when mothership is like, now's the time to sell the motherships. And so everybody
[27:16.650 --> 27:20.650]  sells their ships or I guess elbow in this example, everybody had the Brontos and they were
[27:20.650 --> 27:24.810]  like buying them for, I bought mine for $2,000. For example, I bought it from illusion, $2,000
[27:24.810 --> 27:32.650]  brand new, uh, sold it about six months later for $1,700. And I struggled selling it for that,
[27:32.650 --> 27:36.490]  you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And it was usually like before that had no problem. I definitely
[27:36.490 --> 27:40.170]  bought mine at the peak of the, the peak of the hype. I remember when he got it. Yeah. It was
[27:40.170 --> 27:42.970]  like right when I came down for vacation for the first time, even before I moved. It was a great
[27:42.970 --> 27:46.730]  little rig. Yeah. It was sweet. I definitely love that thing. Yeah. But, uh, but I think definitely
[27:46.730 --> 27:51.130]  people, they see what the rigs are going for a retail wise. And so they're like, okay, that's
[27:51.130 --> 27:54.890]  retail. I'm going to put a hype price on it and it goes for a little bit more. And then eventually
[27:54.890 --> 27:57.770]  it's going to build up to a point and then people are going to be like, fuck that. I'm not paying
[27:57.770 --> 28:01.530]  that anymore. So the price will start going down. And then all of a sudden everybody starts to sell
[28:01.530 --> 28:05.930]  their rigs trying to, Oh, should I get rid of this now while they're still still worth something.
[28:05.930 --> 28:11.130]  And then that in itself depreciate depreciates the value a little bit. Yeah. So it's a little
[28:11.130 --> 28:15.130]  interesting. It's funny to see the mothership hype. I saw the motherships go rollercoaster,
[28:15.610 --> 28:22.490]  the same rig went from 12 to 18 to 24 to 28 to 32. And now they're about 18.
[28:22.490 --> 28:26.810]  Dude, there was a time when you could get, I mean, clear, clear ships were going for like 9k
[28:26.810 --> 28:31.610]  at one point 5k some shit. I was like, Holy hell, are you kidding me? There are new ships. One just
[28:31.610 --> 28:39.050]  sold for $35,000 for the new trifecta. It's a, so mothership is known for the Klein, the Taurus
[28:39.610 --> 28:46.970]  and the fab egg. And they combined all three into one rig sandblasted it and put some crazy
[28:47.530 --> 28:53.050]  logos on it. It's sold for $35,000. So shout out to Scott Deppie. He's doing all right over there.
[28:53.050 --> 28:56.490]  He's doing big shout out to the mothership. If you want to see some crazy glass, you guys,
[28:57.210 --> 29:00.250]  excuse me, I'm all choked up. I'm getting something in my throat here. If you want to
[29:00.250 --> 29:05.610]  see some nice, crazy glass, some high quality glass go, I just hit hashtag mothership,
[29:06.170 --> 29:10.890]  mothership, appreciation, mothership glass, any of that mothership glass you find,
[29:11.610 --> 29:15.770]  it'll impress you. That's amazing shit. Especially those elites and everything.
[29:15.770 --> 29:22.330]  The clear ones, you guys are $3,000 each, 18 to 3000, 1800 to $3,000. The colored ones are starting
[29:22.330 --> 29:27.370]  off about $4,000. You can get a mini for a little minis for 12. Yeah. Yeah. Just the mini with the
[29:27.370 --> 29:32.650]  little swing on it. Yeah. But if you want, yeah. Anything that's not a fixie, you're looking at
[29:32.650 --> 29:38.890]  2,800, 1800 minimum and up. Yeah. So yeah. And that does, that's like 1800 for just the rig,
[29:38.890 --> 29:45.130]  no bucket swing cap, nothing like that. And it's just all hype on names too. Oh man. Holy crap. So
[29:45.130 --> 29:49.770]  how long is it going to take for you to climb your way up to the top there? Oh, I don't even know.
[29:49.770 --> 29:55.050]  That's like it. If I ever get up there, that'd be awesome. But, uh, it's just really a matter of,
[29:55.050 --> 30:00.570]  I mean, with the glass, it's kind of one of those who, you know, what not, it is definitely a lot
[30:00.570 --> 30:05.290]  of what you know, but it is a little bit of who you know too. Um, and who you can sell to. And
[30:05.290 --> 30:11.130]  I'm lucky enough where starting out, um, I have friends from like, cause I used to manage a shop,
[30:11.130 --> 30:15.370]  uh, back in North Carolina, a headshot back in North Carolina for a little bit. And so I've made,
[30:15.370 --> 30:18.890]  um, a little bit of connections through that. And I have a friend who just opened up a shop
[30:18.890 --> 30:23.050]  in North Carolina, uh, transparent dreams on Instagram, check them out. You guys grew up in
[30:23.050 --> 30:27.450]  North Carolina. If anyone wants to check it out. Um, and then some of my old coworkers have opened
[30:27.450 --> 30:32.730]  up shops. Uh, so I've had outlets to put my glass into, uh, from, from, from the get go,
[30:32.730 --> 30:36.810]  which is really nice. Cause I've had, uh, one of my shopmates, you know, he's, he's definitely,
[30:36.810 --> 30:40.490]  he's had some ex shopmates, not shot me anymore. He had some trouble selling his glasses. He's
[30:40.490 --> 30:44.090]  been doing it for two years and he's like, you know, he struggled selling cases. And I'm here
[30:44.090 --> 30:48.810]  like two months in, I was flipping, flipping mini tubes out the door. And he, you just,
[30:48.810 --> 30:52.090]  yeah, it's just a lot of, uh, getting networking and marketing for sure.
[30:52.090 --> 30:55.130]  I got to hit one of your mini tube banger hangers the other day. It hits very well.
[30:55.850 --> 30:59.530]  Little shredders. Yeah. One of the first ones you made. I think the one I gave Mike over there.
[30:59.530 --> 31:03.290]  Yeah. Yeah. Big shout out to Mike. What's his new Instagram name. He's got a new name on Instagram.
[31:03.290 --> 31:07.450]  Team Whedon 710 now. Yeah. Check him out. You guys team lead the 710. That's our buddy. Big Mike.
[31:07.450 --> 31:10.490]  He's a good dude. Make sure you follow him on Instagram. Shout out to the whole garden of

[31:23.850 --> 31:28.090]  over 30 minutes now. Um, dude, thank you for taking some time out of your day to come hang
[31:28.090 --> 31:31.770]  out. Let's start wrapping this up and then we're going to take some dabs. You guys, uh, before we
[31:31.770 --> 31:36.330]  go, let's give some shout outs and talk about some of my favorite glass blowers. Um, I'm,
[31:36.330 --> 31:40.010]  and I don't buy it. I like to look at it. Let me be clear about that. I don't pay the money,
[31:40.010 --> 31:45.770]  but I do appreciate the art, uh, coil, uh, coil condenser. God, Holy shit. Definitely one of my
[31:45.770 --> 31:50.410]  favorites. There's a, his monkeys and his little bananas and that whole little series. It's just
[31:50.410 --> 31:54.810]  very, very cool. Very not. I don't want to say simplistic, but some of, some of the more
[31:54.810 --> 31:58.490]  simplistic stuff that he does is some of my favorite stuff. It's awesome. Also, if you're
[31:58.490 --> 32:03.370]  into that simplistic shit, if you like that real, uh, it's real stylish, but real simple SD Rhino
[32:03.370 --> 32:08.650]  or Rhino Rhino dude, he's one of my favorites to definitely check out coil condenser on Instagram,
[32:08.650 --> 32:13.370]  check out SD. Right. It's at SD Rhino on Instagram. One of my favorites and also Bertone.
[32:14.890 --> 32:18.890]  Yeah. I like this little hustler. Yeah. You can tell. I like that real bold color. Real thick
[32:18.890 --> 32:22.170]  work. That's the kind of stuff that I like. And of course there's Darby home and people like that.
[32:22.170 --> 32:25.130]  That's what I really appreciate. Yeah. So I'm going to go back down this list. We got to give
[32:25.130 --> 32:30.010]  a shout out to mongrel glass. Uh, there's mongrel at mongrel. I think it's mongrel glass on Instagram.
[32:30.010 --> 32:34.890]  All right. There you go. And then combo, uh, is it just combo or their underscores in there?
[32:34.890 --> 32:39.130]  As far as I know, it's just calm. I think it is. And then whitey glass. And then if we're going to
[32:39.130 --> 32:43.610]  talk about glass, you guys make sure you check out hit man, glass, Dougie, uh, support hit man,
[32:43.610 --> 32:49.370]  glass. Those are some homies of mine, uh, berserker, uh, blitzkrieg, you Sheen elbow,
[32:50.010 --> 32:55.610]  salt, and of course, Bobby's snodgrass. You guys check out Bob's not, Bob's not grass started at
[32:55.610 --> 32:59.930]  all. If you want to blow glass, if you want to be a glass blower, you need to go check out anything
[32:59.930 --> 33:04.810]  to do with Bob's snodgrass. Make sure you check out the movie. Uh, the name is leaving my head
[33:04.810 --> 33:08.330]  right. Degenerate art degenerate art. Say, knew that I wanted to say borough hustler for some
[33:08.330 --> 33:13.050]  reason, but I knew that that was not it. I was like, check out the pipe classic movies on YouTube
[33:13.050 --> 33:19.370]  to pipe classic on YouTube. You guys, is there a good YouTube channel or a way for people to go
[33:19.370 --> 33:23.930]  learn how to blow glass? There's a great one. Revere glass on Instagram or sorry, on YouTube.
[33:23.930 --> 33:28.090]  Uh, they have a whole channel and that is how I got my start into it. That's how most people
[33:28.090 --> 33:32.730]  these days are getting their start. And do they have like, like 50 something videos and each one's
[33:32.730 --> 33:37.130]  a little how to video, uh, to do a different little, you know, different technique or something.
[33:37.130 --> 33:40.970]  And they're, they're pretty cool dudes. Dustin Revere and Kevin foot. I've actually got to do it.
[33:40.970 --> 33:43.770]  I heard of the channel. I didn't realize that that's what they did. Yeah. They have a couple
[33:43.770 --> 33:46.490]  different little things they do on there. It's pretty cool. Big shout out. And thanks to those
[33:46.490 --> 33:50.410]  guys for teaching people all the shit that they know. Cause that is a huge art. Oh yeah. Uh,
[33:50.410 --> 33:53.770]  I want to give a big shout out to somebody who will never hear this, but my buddy Ian, uh,
[33:54.570 --> 33:57.930]  I'm not even gonna say his real name, but he's Ian. He's a glass blower. He's not on Instagram
[33:57.930 --> 34:01.130]  or he's not even like that. He's kinda, he doesn't want notoriety. He just wants to make
[34:01.130 --> 34:05.850]  glass and be a glass artist. But, uh, that dude tried to teach me how to blow glass and it wasn't
[34:05.850 --> 34:09.770]  his fault that I couldn't learn. It was totally my fault there. I'm good at several things and
[34:09.770 --> 34:15.610]  blowing glass is definitely not one of them. I got a fiber optic burn. I burned my foot. I don't
[34:15.610 --> 34:19.530]  know how I burned my foot. I don't know what burned me, but something burned my damn foot.
[34:20.170 --> 34:24.490]  I am not meant to blow glass. So shout out to all the people that can and shout out to Ian for
[34:24.490 --> 34:28.730]  trying to teach me and shout out to the raging glass crew that tried to tolerate my dumb ass
[34:28.730 --> 34:33.370]  in their studio for a couple of nights. It only took me like two attempts to realize this is not
[34:33.370 --> 34:37.690]  for me. Yeah. It's hot. You guys, if you want to blow glass, you better be prepared for some heat.
[34:38.010 --> 34:42.250]  Yeah. And you got to get in that fire. You got to just get in there. You got to get, just,
[34:42.250 --> 34:46.170]  there's no, you can't hesitate. No stopping. You just got to keep going and keep that shit spinning
[34:46.170 --> 34:51.050]  and fingers get sweaty. Keep it hot. Oh my God. It's not so much respect. I understand why glass
[34:51.050 --> 34:56.410]  is so expensive to an extent. Yeah. To an extent. Raw glass in itself is expensive too. That's a big
[34:56.410 --> 34:59.930]  thing that people, a lot of things, I think a lot of people don't think about is sometimes you can
[34:59.930 --> 35:04.570]  get like a rod of slime, like a, just a couple ounces of slime, just a single little color rod
[35:04.570 --> 35:09.930]  can cost like 15 bucks for just a little raw. Oh shit. Yeah. And then how many, I know they break
[35:09.930 --> 35:14.810]  in the kiln sometimes when you make a rig. So how many, what percentage of your work will break in
[35:14.810 --> 35:21.610]  the kiln? You know, on a good day, like, uh, I'll get like 20% breakage, but on an average day,
[35:21.610 --> 35:25.930]  it's like 50%. It's just, it'll just be like, not necessarily like in the kiln, but it'll like,
[35:25.930 --> 35:29.210]  it'll break while I'm making it or it'll some, a piece of it'll break. I'll have to make a new
[35:29.210 --> 35:33.610]  piece. Like my base will break because acute angles will kill you. If you have an acute angle
[35:33.610 --> 35:37.930]  on glass, when it, when it cools down, it cracks. Uh, if the seal is not perfect, there's air
[35:37.930 --> 35:42.090]  pockets. There's just so many little, little things that go into it. It cools down quicker
[35:42.090 --> 35:45.930]  than one piece. If it's too thick, it's crazy. Those little details are the things that the
[35:45.930 --> 35:49.850]  China glass are not going to pay attention to, right? Yes. Seals, seals, they're making sure
[35:49.850 --> 35:52.970]  they don't make your needle work. Exactly. They don't have proper anneal cycles. They don't use
[35:52.970 --> 35:56.410]  proper seals. So you could, you know, some of their seals, you could just push it with your
[35:56.410 --> 36:00.490]  thumb and it'll fall off. Oh shit. Yeah. I want to do that. No, not at all. Buy American glass.
[36:00.490 --> 36:04.890]  You guys, if you can support American glass, if you can support a local artist, support a local
[36:04.890 --> 36:09.370]  artist. I know I buy a hit man glass, but there's a reason for that. Dougie is my homie. Uh, they
[36:09.370 --> 36:13.130]  kind of support what I do. I support what they do and they support the community. Yes. That's the,
[36:13.130 --> 36:17.450]  he puts back into the community. So yeah, he does support the chalice fest. No, he's paid me to say
[36:17.450 --> 36:20.570]  that, but support chalice festival. It's going to be freaking huge. This year is going to be
[36:20.570 --> 36:24.170]  awesome. Shout out to Doug for everything he's been doing for the community. I love it. I support
[36:24.170 --> 36:29.370]  it. Doug supports us. It's awesome, dude. Cool. Uh, man. So let's wrap up the show, dude. I want

[36:32.090 --> 36:37.290]  to say while you're being recorded and being put on the, on the world? Uh, sloppy told me to tell
[36:38.250 --> 36:42.410]  you to give a, give his mom a hug or he gave your mom a hug, something like that.

[37:18.490 --> 37:22.090]  stay cheesy glass on Instagram. He's been a huge, huge help ever since I started blowing glass. I
[37:22.090 --> 37:26.090]  guess I should have talked about him earlier, but he's taught me a good bit ever since I got into
[37:26.090 --> 37:29.930]  the studio here in Pueblo. Nice. Big shout out. Blake. I met you at champs. You seem like a cool
[37:29.930 --> 37:32.890]  bro. I wish you could have been here, but it sounds like you're having fun anyway. He's doing
[37:32.890 --> 37:37.850]  enjoy that. Yeah. Yeah. Enjoy that. I heard all about what you're doing, bro. I heard it. I love
[37:37.850 --> 37:41.290]  it. Awesome. All right, man. Well, uh, dude, thanks a lot for coming to talk about glass
[37:41.290 --> 37:45.770]  next time. We'll get you on and maybe, uh, you'll be able to tell us a little bit about how to
[37:45.770 --> 37:49.610]  yeah, definitely man. When I adapt, we'd love to do that. Nice. Nice. You heard it from him,
[37:49.610 --> 37:52.570]  you guys. So we'll get him back here in a couple of weeks. We'll set up another podcast here in
[37:52.570 --> 37:56.250]  two or three weeks. We'll have him come talk about how to blow glass. Just 30 minutes basics.
[37:56.250 --> 37:59.770]  You know, we're not going to get too in depth because if you burn yourselves, I'm not responsible
[37:59.770 --> 38:03.370]  either as well, either as well. Just make sure you know that you get the burn cream,
[38:03.930 --> 38:08.170]  get a fire extinguisher, some aloe. There you go. So a chef told me to rub mustard on it.
[38:08.810 --> 38:13.850]  That I guess that would work. Sure. Maybe it's just a, uh, what's that called? A fucking placebo
[38:13.850 --> 38:18.090]  effect. If you think it works and it works. If it works, it works. There you go. Rub some mustard
[38:18.090 --> 38:22.010]  on it. I don't want to thank everybody for listening. Uh, make sure you support all of
[38:22.010 --> 38:25.690]  the social media stuff. Make sure you follow it. Find me on Instagram under I read genetics.
[38:25.690 --> 38:29.770]  Make sure you follow at barefoot glass. As if you want to see a whole bunch of great glass,
[38:29.770 --> 38:32.970]  go follow all the people I mentioned before. I'm sure I said it several times. You're probably done
[38:32.970 --> 38:38.410]  hearing it. Um, I'm not going to read all that stuff that I normally read because you're probably
[38:38.410 --> 38:43.050]  tired of hearing it and you probably know it all by now. So I'm just going to wrap it up like this.
[38:43.050 --> 38:46.410]  You guys, thanks again for listening. I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[38:46.410 --> 38:50.810]  Shout out to my guests for joining me until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for
[40:43.220 --> 40:43.860]  your head.
