[01:11.840 --> 01:13.120]  genetics. All right,
[01:13.120 --> 01:15.520]  you guys know I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I'm
[01:15.520 --> 01:18.760]  smoking on. I've got a fresh new pickup of some concentrates.
[01:19.120 --> 01:21.400]  I grabbed some lemon Versace nectar,
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.760]  which is a mix of lemon OG and Skittles.
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.840]  When I brought this home and took a dab of it,
[01:26.840 --> 01:29.400]  I hadn't read the package yet to see what the flavor description was.
[01:29.400 --> 01:32.080]  I was just excited. I was like, lemon Versace. I want a dab of that.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.160]  So I got home and took a fat dab of the lemon Versace.
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.000]  It tasted like I described it as a burnt marshmallow with lemon juice on top of
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.680]  it. It was pleasant and I enjoyed it, but it was very unique.
[01:43.840 --> 01:46.240]  So then I grabbed the package and I looked at what it's described as.
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.040]  And it says unique lemon profile, sweet, sour, candied, and burnt.
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.240]  So I definitely picked up on the unique lemon profile and I got the burnt,
[01:55.280 --> 01:58.040]  the sweet, sour, and candied. I didn't really notice much of,
[01:58.360 --> 02:00.960]  but that burnt marshmallow flavor was kind of pleasant.
[02:00.960 --> 02:04.080]  I've never had that in a dab before. So that was nice.
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.760]  The thing about the lemon Versace, it didn't do much for me. Uh, high wise,
[02:08.760 --> 02:12.480]  it didn't get me high. It did not medicate me. It didn't really do a whole lot.
[02:12.760 --> 02:14.680]  I, it tastes amazing. It tastes really good,
[02:15.040 --> 02:18.240]  but it doesn't do much for what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to get high.
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.360]  I'm not just trying to taste it. I also picked up some infinity OG nectar,
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.160]  which is a combination of underdog OG and I 95.
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.080]  This is described as a gas and earth. I popped this open.
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.960]  It took a fat dab of this and it was tremendous earthy gas all over my tongue,
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.080]  all in my face. The high was incredible.
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.080]  The infinity OG nectar was really nice. So what I decided to do,
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.120]  you know me, I took a good size dab of the infinity OG nectar.
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.680]  And then I dunked that right inside of the lemon Versace nectar.
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.560]  And I took a dab of that combo and that is like a lemon gas
[02:54.600 --> 02:57.920]  punch to the face. And it gave me a super nice flavor.
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.000]  It had a tremendous face high to it. It went right to my face, right to my head.
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.280]  That was an amazing combo. So the infinity OG put the punch in there.
[03:06.440 --> 03:09.640]  It put that gas in there. And then that lemon Versace,
[03:09.640 --> 03:11.640]  put that lemon Skittles candy turp.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.880]  It kind of washed out that burnt marshmallow and brought out more of the candy
[03:14.880 --> 03:17.680]  flavor. It was a really good idea. I thought to mix them.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.040]  So that's what I'm dabbing on you guys,
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.800]  the infinity OG nectar and the lemon Versace nectar combination from green dot
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.120]  labs. Obviously it's got me nice and rambly,
[03:26.400 --> 03:29.560]  which is good because this is going to be a long podcast.
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.200]  I've got a great topic to get into,
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.120]  but first let's talk a little bit about what I did Thursday evening.
[03:36.120 --> 03:38.680]  While you guys were hanging out, listening to the new episode of the show,
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.640]  I was in Denver seeing Wheeler Walker jr. At the Gothic theater. Now,
[03:43.640 --> 03:46.400]  if you know who Wheeler Walker jr. Is, you're probably going, what?
[03:46.400 --> 03:48.280]  Rasta Jeff went to a country concert.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.800]  And if you don't know who Wheeler Walker jr. Is,
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.200]  let me explain to you that Rasta Jeff went to a country concert.
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.240]  I've never referred to myself in third person like that. That was awkward. Anyway,
[03:58.480 --> 04:00.720]  yes, I went to my very first country concert.
[04:00.720 --> 04:04.880]  I saw Wheeler Walker jr. And two other acts at the Gothic theater in Denver,
[04:04.880 --> 04:06.520]  Colorado. Uh,
[04:06.840 --> 04:10.160]  I went to see Wheeler because I think Wheeler Walker is hilarious.
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.000]  He comes out dressed in full cowboy fucking rebel cowboy outfit.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.320]  He's got his boots and his tight jeans and his fucking belt buckle that you
[04:18.320 --> 04:19.520]  could use as a dinner plate.
[04:19.720 --> 04:22.920]  And then he's got a long sleeve flannel shirt tucked in and he's got it buttoned
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.480]  up all the way to the top. And then he's got the cowboy beard.
[04:26.480 --> 04:27.720]  That's well kept. You know what I mean?
[04:27.720 --> 04:29.840]  It's just long enough to say I'm a rebel motherfucker,
[04:29.840 --> 04:33.040]  but then it's kept nice and tight. Also, he's got that big bushy mustache.
[04:33.480 --> 04:35.200]  He's got them cop glasses looking at you.
[04:35.200 --> 04:38.200]  And then he's got his big Wheeler Walker jr. Cowboy hat on.
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.280]  And he comes out and they start playing this. If you're,
[04:41.480 --> 04:44.360]  I'm not into country music necessarily, but I don't hate country music.
[04:44.360 --> 04:45.440]  I'm a musician. I've been,
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.320]  I've been hired to play in country bands before and you learn to appreciate it.
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.680]  And it's not bad. The, especially the shit Wheeler does. It's kinda,
[04:52.680 --> 04:55.960]  it's the fun kind of country. It's that rowdy fucking,
[04:56.240 --> 04:59.080]  I guess it's called rebel country is what they call it. I'm not a country fan,
[04:59.080 --> 05:02.400]  but I think so. He comes out and he does this like rock and roll country shit.
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.440]  Right. Then he starts singing lyrics that are just ridiculous.
[05:06.440 --> 05:08.440]  And we'll get into that here in a minute. Let's talk more about the show.
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.400]  And then, then we'll top this off with some of the song titles and some of the
[05:11.400 --> 05:13.520]  lyrics. Uh, so I drive up to Denver.
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.360]  I park as I'm walking in. I realized I am the only dreadlocked guy in the
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.200]  building. I'm the only one there that is not a country music fan.
[05:22.200 --> 05:23.360]  I'm so far.
[05:23.360 --> 05:28.160]  I'm the only one I've seen that is there for the joke that is Wheeler Walker
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.280]  jr. And I'm kind of feeling a little bit out of place.
[05:32.320 --> 05:36.280]  The first band was straight up country. They were fucking good. You guys,
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.360]  they were really good. They were so soulful. Uh, the,
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.480]  they had a singer that played acoustic guitar. They had a full band,
[05:42.480 --> 05:44.160]  bass drums, uh, lead guitar,
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.560]  but the singer played acoustic guitar and they had a female singer that sang
[05:48.560 --> 05:51.000]  with him that I'm going to assume they were related.
[05:51.040 --> 05:53.680]  They had to be brother or sister somewhere along the line.
[05:53.920 --> 05:56.360]  They've been singing together for years because they sounded rich.
[05:56.640 --> 06:00.320]  Like the sound that came out of them was real. Uh, they sounded really good.
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.400]  So I don't know the name of the opening act. I apologize for that.
[06:02.400 --> 06:03.480]  I didn't pay any attention to that.
[06:03.880 --> 06:07.480]  I was just trying to get comfortable in the environment. I've never been, uh,
[06:08.200 --> 06:11.360]  in that environment. It was a lot of country fans. You guys,
[06:11.360 --> 06:15.640]  it was folks in tight jeans and flannel shirts and fucking beards and a wad of
[06:15.640 --> 06:17.800]  chew and a hat in their face. And that's not my environment.
[06:17.800 --> 06:21.160]  I don't know how they're going to take me encroaching on their show.
[06:21.360 --> 06:24.480]  So I'm just trying to walk around and like, you know, get a feel. Am I welcome?
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.720]  And I was, I was,
[06:25.880 --> 06:30.120]  so it was kind of silly on my part to feel that these country fans may not want
[06:30.120 --> 06:32.320]  me there. They didn't give a shit. I got a few looks.
[06:32.840 --> 06:34.840]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass. I get looks,
[06:35.200 --> 06:38.320]  but nobody gave a shit that I was a weirdo at the country show.
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.640]  So that was cool. Then the second act came on and I spent the first, uh,
[06:42.640 --> 06:44.280]  since I just snuck in during the first band,
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.800]  I don't like to go walk right in front of people while the band is playing.
[06:47.200 --> 06:50.720]  So I just went toward the back of the club and got a big view of the whole club.
[06:50.720 --> 06:53.080]  And then as the first band picked up their gear,
[06:53.280 --> 06:55.960]  I walked closer to the stage and got a little up closer.
[06:56.520 --> 07:01.280]  And then the second opener came out and he was not very entertaining.
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.360]  The crowd was talking over him and kind of, they were,
[07:03.400 --> 07:07.200]  they were bored with him and he could feel the vibe. But then, uh,
[07:07.200 --> 07:09.640]  someone lit a joint in the crowd or some weed somewhere.
[07:10.160 --> 07:12.640]  And the country crowd got really weird about it.
[07:12.640 --> 07:14.800]  And the funny part is it was bad smelling weed.
[07:14.800 --> 07:17.080]  It smelled like a shitty roach or it just,
[07:17.160 --> 07:19.000]  it didn't smell like good weed and someone lit weed.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.720]  And that country crowd kind of got uptight. You can see there kind of,
[07:21.720 --> 07:24.120]  some of them were like, someone's smoking weed. And some of them were like, Ooh,
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.280]  someone's smoking weed. But it was kind of a,
[07:26.520 --> 07:29.280]  it was way different than the shows I'm used to. When someone smokes weed,
[07:29.480 --> 07:31.600]  nobody even notices because we're all smoking weed.
[07:31.880 --> 07:35.440]  But it was just really funny to smell somebody light some swag weed and then
[07:35.480 --> 07:37.120]  watch the whole crowd kind of looked around.
[07:37.120 --> 07:40.120]  A couple of them looked right at me like, no, I can see both of his hands.
[07:40.360 --> 07:42.400]  I knew better. I wasn't going to fucking smoke weed in there.
[07:42.720 --> 07:43.720]  Be the only one in there.
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.440]  And they run you through a pretty rigorous security thing on the way in.
[07:46.440 --> 07:50.400]  But it turns out that second opener that came out, it was one guy.
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.480]  He came out and played a couple of songs by himself.
[07:52.480 --> 07:56.080]  He ended up actually being Wheeler's bass player. So when Wheeler came out, uh,
[07:56.120 --> 08:00.480]  that was the bass player for Wheeler Walker jr's band. Anyhow. Um,
[08:00.960 --> 08:03.800]  so the first opener was cool. The second opener was awkward.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.880]  It was just one dude singing songs, playing a guitar.
[08:05.880 --> 08:07.640]  He played bass and sang a couple of times,
[08:07.640 --> 08:11.560]  which that's not really a popular thing to play bass and sing. Um,
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.800]  someone like weed, then a couple of,
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.640]  as the night went on and things got later, more non country fans came,
[08:18.640 --> 08:22.040]  more people that looked like they discovered Wheeler through Joe Rogan's
[08:22.040 --> 08:22.680]  podcast,
[08:22.680 --> 08:26.800]  more people that looked like they discovered Wheeler Walker jr through Joey Diaz's
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.800]  podcast or Bert Kreischer's podcast,
[08:28.800 --> 08:31.040]  which are all places where I've listened to Wheeler.
[08:31.560 --> 08:34.480]  I first found Wheeler through the Joe Rogan experience podcast.
[08:34.480 --> 08:36.920]  And I really liked his songs. I started listening. Uh,
[08:36.920 --> 08:40.200]  and I thought it was funny. And then he was on a Diaz's show.
[08:40.200 --> 08:43.200]  And so I listened there and I just, that kind of like solidified the,
[08:43.360 --> 08:45.680]  the songs were in my head and the dude's attitude was kind of funny.
[08:45.680 --> 08:47.960]  So I had to listen from there. Anyway,
[08:48.440 --> 08:52.320]  more people started piling in as the night went on that were obviously not
[08:52.360 --> 08:53.160]  country fans,
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.320]  or at least they weren't dressed in the country attire that some of the earlier
[08:56.600 --> 08:59.400]  arrivers were dressed in, uh, nothing against them.
[08:59.400 --> 09:00.960]  It's just obvious country attire.
[09:00.960 --> 09:04.080]  And I'm guessing I'm wearing hippie or woke attire, whatever you want to call it.
[09:04.680 --> 09:07.880]  Uh, you could, you could spot the differences in the folks. Uh,
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.240]  so a couple of younger cats stood in front of me and I'm wearing a grow from
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.360]  your heart podcast t-shirt.
[09:13.360 --> 09:16.200]  And one of the younger bros turns to me and he says, whose podcast is that?
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.840]  And I was like, Oh, that's my show, bro. It's all about weed.
[09:19.400 --> 09:21.480]  And we start talking for a few and they're like,
[09:21.600 --> 09:23.560]  what other shows do you listen to? And I was like, Oh dude,
[09:23.560 --> 09:26.040]  I listened to Doug loves movies. I listened to Diaz. Actually.
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.240]  They asked me if I listened to the church of what's happening now.
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.760]  And my answer was probably fuck. Yeah. Cocksucker.
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.600]  Because if you listen to the church of what's happening now,
[09:32.600 --> 09:35.200]  that's your answer. If somebody asks you, if you listen to it, you say, fuck.
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.280]  Yeah. Cocksucker. So that started conversation, uh,
[09:39.320 --> 09:41.200]  two young dudes named Doug and Daniel,
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.360]  they were a good time to hang out with. I went to the show by myself.
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.680]  So it was cool to have two dudes show up right in front of me that were, uh,
[09:46.720 --> 09:48.280]  fans of all the other stuff I listened to.
[09:48.280 --> 09:50.320]  They were fans of Wheeler because of the funniness,
[09:50.320 --> 09:52.800]  not because it's the new kind of country music.
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.360]  And they also are exposed to the podcast now. So shout out to Doug and Daniel.
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.560]  I hope you guys are listening to the show. So, uh,
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.760]  our conversation gets interrupted because fucking Wheeler Walker wants to come
[10:03.760 --> 10:06.280]  out and do a concert, right? So the lights go down and Wheeler comes out.
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.160]  And he starts playing honestly, what might be my favorite Wheeler Walker song.
[10:11.400 --> 10:13.880]  It's called a song's actually called sit on my face.
[10:13.880 --> 10:15.280]  We're going to get into that in a little bit here.
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.560]  And I posted a couple of really cool videos to YouTube.
[10:17.560 --> 10:21.080]  I hope you guys enjoy that. Uh, so Wheeler comes out, he plays his first song.
[10:21.600 --> 10:24.000]  At the end of the first song, he's like, why are you flipping me off?
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.400]  And some girl in the crowd has been flipping him off for the whole first song.
[10:26.440 --> 10:28.720]  So he kicked her the fuck out, which kind of made it awkward.
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.120]  But then he went right back into the show, which was kind of cool. Uh,
[10:32.160 --> 10:33.640]  he played a bunch of great songs. He has,
[10:33.640 --> 10:35.680]  I've got a list of the songs on my phone. I'm going to pull it up here,
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.280]  but he played a brand new weed song. He's like, Hey, since I'm in Colorado,
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.680]  I figured I would debut my new weed song.
[10:41.720 --> 10:43.480]  And I was smart enough to pull out my phone.
[10:43.680 --> 10:46.560]  I caught a pretty sweet recording of that. Uh,
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.160]  so that's up on the YouTube channel. Then, uh,
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.200]  he played more songs that are listed on my phone.
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.120]  I'm going to read some of those titles. Uh, let's do that now. Let's see.
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.040]  Some of the songs he played were, uh, finger in my butt.
[11:00.440 --> 11:03.160]  Uh, he played a song called eating pussy and kicking ass.
[11:03.440 --> 11:07.760]  And the encore was pussy King. And then the other one of the encores,
[11:07.960 --> 11:12.760]  I'm not even going to say the fucking name of the song because it's kind of
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.920]  offensive. And I don't even want to say that on my show.
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.480]  So you could tell he comes out and he plays his country music, right?
[11:18.800 --> 11:20.320]  The whole band is dressed country.
[11:20.360 --> 11:22.880]  It looks like you're at a fucking serious country show.
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.960]  And this dude starts singing and he starts singing about, like I said,
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.640]  the first song is called sit on my face.
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.520]  This song is straight up about sitting on my face.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.200]  And it's really hilarious the way he does it because it's,
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.200]  it sounds like you're going to hear some of those twangy fucking truck broke
[11:39.200 --> 11:42.480]  down. Dog ran away. Girlfriend left me kind of fucking rebel,
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.000]  rock and country things coming out, but it's not, it's, it's really hilarious.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.720]  So one of the things that I really laughed at,
[11:49.720 --> 11:52.080]  he does a song and he, at the start of the song, he goes,
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.360]  this one is for your whole family. And I knew what it was going to be.
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.680]  It's a song called family tree.
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.280]  And it is a filthy song about fucking his way up your family tree.
[12:01.400 --> 12:04.040]  And that's literally what it's about. And one of the lines is,
[12:04.240 --> 12:07.640]  if I had my druthers, I'd butt fuck both your brothers. Yes.
[12:07.640 --> 12:10.400]  That's what this man wrote for his country song. I didn't write these lyrics.
[12:10.400 --> 12:13.360]  I only laughed to them and reported them to you. But he says,
[12:13.680 --> 12:16.440]  if I had my druthers, I'd butt fuck both your brothers.
[12:16.720 --> 12:20.000]  Then I'd find your sister and take her out back and fester.
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.480]  And the funniest fucking part of the evening was when this theater filled with
[12:24.480 --> 12:27.000]  people dressed in country folk attire,
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.920]  they looked like great hardworking people, including they're really cute.
[12:31.920 --> 12:33.360]  Those little country girls are adorable.
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.320]  Little jean shorts and a little tank top and a big old country smile.
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.160]  And they got that sweet accent and they just smile at you. Uh,
[12:39.160 --> 12:41.640]  those country girls are fucking adorable. But then they,
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.240]  when he says take her out back and fester the entire theater,
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.120]  every person in there did their own sort of animated motion of a fisting
[12:50.120 --> 12:52.800]  motion. There were a couple of uppercuts. There were a couple of like,
[12:53.240 --> 12:55.760]  the guy did the move. Like he's putting on a rubber glove. There were,
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.000]  everybody did some sort of fisting motion and it made me laugh so
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.520]  hard. It was some of the funniest shit I've seen in a long time. It was unplanned.
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.040]  It was unchoreographed, but just imagine a country looking audience.
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.280]  Everybody looks all nice, right? They got a beer in their hand.
[13:10.280 --> 13:12.400]  Their shirts are all nice. He looked fucking good tonight.
[13:12.840 --> 13:13.840]  And then this dude says,
[13:14.080 --> 13:17.920]  take her out back and fester and everybody made the goddamn fester motion.
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.480]  It was hilarious. It was truly hilarious to me. That's what I was there for.
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.880]  I wanted to go see what that was like live in person.
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.760]  I honestly thought it was going to be a sausage fest.
[13:27.760 --> 13:30.280]  I thought there was going to be like 40 dudes up in the front,
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.280]  but that place was packed. It was a very, toward the end of the night,
[13:34.560 --> 13:38.080]  it was quite a diverse crowd. It wasn't all country fan folks.
[13:38.080 --> 13:39.000]  There were a lot of, uh,
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.960]  people that I would assume found Wheeler through the podcasts like myself and
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.400]  just wanted to go see this. It's kind of comedy. It's hilarious. I love music.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.560]  I love comedy. When you mix the two, that's some of my favorite shit.
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.400]  And just seeing a theater full of people singing along to songs like drop them
[13:55.400 --> 13:58.920]  out, drop them out as about letting me see your boobs and redneck shit.
[13:58.920 --> 14:00.240]  It's just about redneck shit.
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.760]  And eating pussy and kicking ass was one of the funniest to see.
[14:05.080 --> 14:07.200]  Just seeing these little country girls singing,
[14:07.200 --> 14:10.280]  eating pussy and kicking ass was so hilarious. You guys, it was really funny.
[14:10.480 --> 14:13.400]  So it was a really affordable show. I couldn't believe how cheap it was.
[14:13.400 --> 14:14.880]  I definitely got my money's worth.
[14:14.880 --> 14:17.120]  It cost me more in gas than it costs to get in the show.
[14:17.120 --> 14:20.560]  So that was a good time. I know a lot of people are going to say country music.
[14:20.560 --> 14:22.640]  I can't stand country music. It's,
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.920]  that's just the thing in your head that has a label and you decide you don't like
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.680]  it because it's got that label on it. If you can,
[14:27.960 --> 14:31.600]  if you can appreciate the fucking rhythm and then you can go listen to the words
[14:31.600 --> 14:34.040]  that are happening on top of it and put the whole picture together,
[14:34.320 --> 14:37.360]  it will make you giggle. It will make you laugh at some funny shit.
[14:37.760 --> 14:40.200]  So that's my experience in my first country show.
[14:40.440 --> 14:43.160]  I don't know if that totally counts cause it was a Wheeler Walker Jr,
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.320]  but it was pretty damn close. It's as close as I think I'm going to get,
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.200]  but I had a good ass time.
[14:48.200 --> 14:52.400]  So shout out to a Wheeler Walker Jr and his band and also shout out to the Gothic
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.880]  theater. You guys,
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.680]  this podcast may get long because I am going to do a long talk after I take a
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.560]  dab and a drink. I'm going to do a talk about genetic drift.
[15:02.560 --> 15:05.480]  We're actually going to change the terminology. We're going to change your mind.
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.080]  We're going to change your thought process on genetic drift. Stay tuned.
[15:09.080 --> 15:09.920]  I'll be right back.
[15:21.480 --> 15:23.280]  All right, podcast world. I am back.
[15:23.280 --> 15:25.800]  I am well hydrated and heavily medicated.
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.320]  Thanks for being patient with me while I got my life together momentarily.
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.600]  While I was gone, I took some dabs of this custom OG's nectar.
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.520]  It is a blend of Skittles and AFGUI and Larry OG.
[15:38.520 --> 15:41.160]  The flavor is described as assorted hard candies.
[15:41.520 --> 15:44.640]  I didn't really get the assorted hard candies that the label describes.
[15:45.040 --> 15:48.480]  It's more of a, it's kind of a fruity sort of a thing, which I guess could,
[15:48.760 --> 15:52.320]  could, could translate to fruity candy, but it's more of a fruit,
[15:52.320 --> 15:54.960]  kind of a floral nectary kind of a thing. I'm enjoying it.
[15:55.480 --> 15:57.640]  This was a good high kind of mellowed me out,
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.800]  not as super high speed as I was before.
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.360]  So that should be good for this portion of the podcast. Before we took a break,
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.040]  I teased that we were going to talk about genetic drift.
[16:07.040 --> 16:10.120]  And I said we were going to change your mind about genetic drift.
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.760]  Let's get right into it. I've got a lot of notes on the iPad for this one.
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.120]  So let's start with what is genetic drift or what do we think genetic drift
[16:19.120 --> 16:19.840]  means?
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.120]  Some growers believe that cloning plant over multiple generations will lead to a
[16:24.160 --> 16:27.120]  loss of plant vigor, health, or potency.
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.280]  So imagine if you've got a plant and you want to grow it again, right?
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.160]  So you can take a clone off of it. Then you flower that plant out.
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.120]  Now you've got a clone that plant grows up. You take clones off of that.
[16:37.120 --> 16:39.680]  You flower that out. Now you've got clones in preservation.
[16:39.680 --> 16:41.040]  You just keep repeating that process.
[16:41.800 --> 16:45.680]  Some folks believe that over time that will lead to problems,
[16:45.680 --> 16:48.880]  which is known as genetic drift. Now, cannabis is an annual plant,
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.400]  meaning it would only live for one year or one season. Naturally,
[16:52.400 --> 16:56.160]  our natural growing season outdoors is dictated by the sun.
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.320]  The natural cannabis plant life cycle is usually about six to eight months long
[17:00.320 --> 17:01.720]  without any human interaction,
[17:01.960 --> 17:06.720]  depending on where those plants are located from the equator in relation to the
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.040]  equator. They may be shorter or longer just based on where they are.
[17:10.480 --> 17:14.920]  So to keep our selected genetic library available, we keep mother plants.
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.360]  Mother plants are clones of select cultivars that are kept in a perpetual
[17:19.400 --> 17:23.800]  vegetative state by keeping that light cycle on for 18 or more hours per day.
[17:24.320 --> 17:28.880]  Now those mother plants act as preserve for our genetic stable and also to
[17:28.880 --> 17:30.960]  provide clones for production,
[17:30.960 --> 17:34.200]  whether it's for flowering amount for production or for breeding,
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.000]  whatever you're doing, that's where the clones will come from for the future.
[17:37.840 --> 17:41.760]  Now we're able to grow out a large mother plant and we can take 50 to a hundred,
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.440]  maybe even more clones from a single mother plant and run those for production.
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.240]  Now that ensures that all of my plants in that production run are the same
[17:49.240 --> 17:52.800]  thing. They're all tried, true, tested, reliable, potent,
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.720]  female plants that I've ran before. I know that they've got resistance to pest.
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.440]  They've got resistance to pathogens and I know how long it takes them to flower.
[18:01.680 --> 18:02.840]  I know what to look for.
[18:02.920 --> 18:05.560]  I know when certain things are going to happen in the growth phase.
[18:05.800 --> 18:08.760]  So I'm running 50 to a hundred of the same thing.
[18:09.160 --> 18:11.480]  This makes my garden easy to manage.
[18:12.080 --> 18:14.360]  I've grown this specific cultivar plenty of times,
[18:14.560 --> 18:17.400]  so I know what to expect. I've got a relationship with it now.
[18:17.640 --> 18:19.920]  So I know that I've got a hundred of the same thing to work with.
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.440]  So there are no variables and I can hit my goals and that makes everybody happy.
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.240]  Me, I'm happy because I've hit my goals.
[18:26.240 --> 18:28.840]  The grow team's happy because we likely get a bonus.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.080]  The owners are happy because they're making more money because the store has
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.880]  quality product. The customers are happy.
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.080]  The patients are happy because they're buying a quality product and there's
[18:37.080 --> 18:37.900]  plenty of it.
[18:37.900 --> 18:42.440]  So it makes everybody happy when I hit my goals as a cultivation manager.
[18:42.600 --> 18:45.360]  Now over time, these mother plants we work with,
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.000]  they get too large and you can't really just keep cutting them down smaller
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.920]  because they get misshapen and they become a difficult mess.
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.520]  They just have the plant with a super thick stock on it.
[18:55.520 --> 18:57.200]  That's just got two arms coming off of it.
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.760]  That's got a whole bunch of mini arms coming off different directions.
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.440]  They just get messy and hard to deal with. So after a while,
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.200]  it's time to replace your mother plant. That's a simple process.
[19:07.240 --> 19:10.800]  I replace my mother plants every three to six months ish,
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.840]  depending on the state of my garden and depending on which cultivar I am working
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.200]  with. Some things that grow super fast, like the redheaded stranger,
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.360]  it's got to get replaced more frequently than something like probably the chem
[19:23.360 --> 19:25.480]  four, the chem four doesn't grow super fast.
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.400]  That redheaded stranger grows super fast. Uh, the chem four,
[19:29.600 --> 19:31.760]  it doesn't get as root bound as quickly.
[19:31.800 --> 19:33.640]  That redheaded stranger will grow up into the lights.
[19:33.840 --> 19:36.480]  I'll top it a couple of times. It'll bush out real wide.
[19:36.480 --> 19:38.800]  I'll top it a couple more times. It'll bush out even wider.
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.800]  It'll start tipping itself over and want a bigger pot. It's got to go.
[19:41.800 --> 19:44.120]  It's either got to go in a bigger pot, which I don't really have room for.
[19:44.120 --> 19:45.800]  I don't need that big of a mother plant.
[19:46.120 --> 19:49.080]  So then it just gets recloned off of I cut a couple of clones. Anyway,
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.880]  we'll keep talking about that. It's time to replace your mother plants.
[19:52.320 --> 19:53.320]  It's a simple process.
[19:53.720 --> 19:57.440]  I reclone all of the large moms and create fresh new mom stock.
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.440]  So just go to all of my mother plants and pull off like one row,
[20:01.480 --> 20:04.600]  like five or 10, however many you think you need for one row of your cloner.
[20:04.800 --> 20:07.560]  Just pull off enough so that you've got plenty of clones for that keeper.
[20:07.840 --> 20:08.680]  Pull them off of there.
[20:09.160 --> 20:13.400]  Or if you need a large batch like a hundred or whatever extra take those hundred
[20:13.400 --> 20:15.240]  clones. I'll cut like a hundred. If I need a hundred,
[20:15.240 --> 20:17.800]  I'll cut a solid hundred plus a 20 extra for backups.
[20:18.280 --> 20:21.240]  That way if something goes wrong, then I've got some better selection.
[20:21.520 --> 20:24.800]  Then I'll cut as many clones as I can get off that bigger mother plant.
[20:25.160 --> 20:28.760]  And then I'll use one of the really good looking clones as my replacement
[20:28.760 --> 20:29.560]  mother.
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.040]  Now sometimes I keep the old mom around until I've got roots on my new clones,
[20:33.240 --> 20:36.560]  but my clone skills are pretty reliable. So those, those,
[20:36.560 --> 20:39.040]  all those clones I cut, I'm pretty sure something's going to root.
[20:39.040 --> 20:42.640]  But if you don't have super good clone skills,
[20:42.800 --> 20:47.520]  maybe take a few extra clones in case something happens or, uh, the,
[20:47.520 --> 20:50.160]  the always the fucking clones in the corners of the trays.
[20:50.200 --> 20:53.400]  They're always a challenge. So we cut a few extras just so you know,
[20:53.400 --> 20:57.440]  you have a survivor. If you're cutting new mother stock, you want that to survive.
[20:57.440 --> 20:59.400]  So cut as many as you can.
[20:59.640 --> 21:03.120]  And then maybe consider leaving a little portion of that plant alive,
[21:03.120 --> 21:04.720]  just like one or two small branches,
[21:04.920 --> 21:08.240]  leave yourself one or two more clones to cut in case you failed.
[21:08.400 --> 21:11.280]  And you've still got that mother plant. You can still keep that cultivar.
[21:11.480 --> 21:14.640]  You've got a little preserve over there that it totally looks like shit,
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.200]  but it's there. It exists.
[21:16.800 --> 21:20.520]  So that's basically my process of keeping and replacing a mother plant.
[21:20.520 --> 21:23.800]  It's fairly similar when I'm doing it in a small home growth,
[21:23.800 --> 21:26.520]  I'm doing it in a private growth. I'm doing it in a breeder grow.
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.360]  It's fairly similar. If I'm doing it in a commercial grow, when I say 100,
[21:30.360 --> 21:33.920]  120 plants, consider that the commercial grow all the time, the home grow,
[21:34.160 --> 21:35.640]  it's very small numbers nowadays.
[21:35.640 --> 21:39.320]  They've limited us so ridiculously in Colorado that I'm taking like three clones
[21:39.320 --> 21:43.560]  at a time just to make sure I've got a copy of that plant. So when I say 120,
[21:43.560 --> 21:45.920]  that's the commercial grow kind of scale. Don't get confused.
[21:46.480 --> 21:48.320]  When I say smaller numbers, that's the home grow,
[21:48.320 --> 21:50.960]  but it's all a similar process. When you're keeping mother plants,
[21:51.240 --> 21:53.640]  you've got a plant, you need to keep it in veg perpetually.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.280]  Then eventually you need to replace it.
[21:56.520 --> 22:00.000]  So now when we're replacing these plants, we're cutting clones from it,
[22:00.360 --> 22:03.280]  and then we're going to take that clone and we're going to grow it up big again.
[22:03.480 --> 22:05.520]  And then we're going to cut clones from it. Like I said earlier,
[22:05.520 --> 22:07.160]  if that one's going to grow, then it's going to,
[22:07.360 --> 22:09.800]  we're just going to keep cutting clones off of clones off of clones.
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.560]  That starts to lead us into where genetic drift is suspected to start happening.
[22:16.760 --> 22:20.840]  Through several rounds of cloning and vegging and then creating new moms and
[22:20.840 --> 22:22.920]  then clones and then vegging, like I said,
[22:22.920 --> 22:26.760]  we give the opportunity for what has been referred to as genetic drift.
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.520]  A lot of growers suspect that these plants get tired or that their genetics
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.440]  change over generations and the subsequent generations become less vigorous,
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.280]  less potent, and more prone to pest and pathogenic attacks.
[22:42.120 --> 22:47.120]  Now I personally have always been skeptical of genetic drift and I always blamed
[22:47.160 --> 22:51.640]  it on poor plant health or I blamed it on the grower or the person who cut the
[22:51.640 --> 22:52.480]  clone.
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.120]  And I feel like most of your genetic drift issues are probably caused within the
[22:56.120 --> 22:58.000]  first 24 hours of propagation.
[22:58.720 --> 23:02.920]  It's probably from inexperienced clone techniques, poor vapor pressure deficit,
[23:03.160 --> 23:08.040]  improper lighting, lack of nutrients, or the presence of pathogens,
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.080]  were usually my assumptions on what was causing what people were calling genetic
[23:12.080 --> 23:12.360]  drift.
[23:12.360 --> 23:15.200]  Because we would see it early on when people were saying that they had it.
[23:15.880 --> 23:17.200]  So I've always been skeptical.
[23:17.400 --> 23:22.400]  I've had my flow plant since 2007 or 2008.
[23:23.080 --> 23:24.840]  I'm not sure exactly when I got it.
[23:24.840 --> 23:28.040]  That timeframe is kind of fuzzy. And of course I got a traumatic brain injury,
[23:28.040 --> 23:30.880]  but I know where I was when I got it. I know who gave it to me.
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.920]  So I know it was about 2007, 2008 ish.
[23:34.320 --> 23:38.320]  I'm actually running that same flow plant for her very last time.
[23:38.320 --> 23:42.560]  Now there's nothing wrong with her. I'm just, I've ran it for so long.
[23:42.560 --> 23:45.080]  It's been crossed with everything. It's been there, done that.
[23:45.480 --> 23:48.440]  And like I keep saying that they've changed the rules in Colorado to where our
[23:48.440 --> 23:51.120]  numbers are limited. I would like to play with something new.
[23:51.280 --> 23:54.680]  And if I want to do that, I have to retire something old and flow.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.640]  It's time for her to go. So I'm running flow for her last time right now.
[24:00.080 --> 24:04.200]  She is just a few days away from being pollinated by King Solomon to make one
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.360]  last batch of piranha seeds. So she's had a long fun run,
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.960]  but I need to move on to something new. Anyway,
[24:09.360 --> 24:12.520]  I got that flow clone from my friend in 2007 or eight ish.
[24:12.520 --> 24:16.880]  Now imagine how many times I've had to re clone and remodel this one cultivar
[24:16.920 --> 24:18.320]  over the past 10 years.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.440]  It would be at least 20 times if I've done it every six months.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.280]  So I'm sure it was more.
[24:23.880 --> 24:26.560]  I'm sure it was more than that because there were times when I've moved,
[24:26.560 --> 24:28.960]  I've moved different houses. I've moved different facilities.
[24:29.320 --> 24:33.280]  I have taken it from the house where I lived to the new house,
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.240]  to the other house.
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.640]  Then I took it from the house to the house, to a grow facility,
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.760]  to another facility. And it still looks amazing. It still looks the same.
[24:43.640 --> 24:47.960]  It performs exactly as I remember in all of those conditions.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.920]  It does the same thing since I got her in 2007,
[24:51.320 --> 24:54.240]  somebody else was growing her in 2007 and gave it to me.
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.720]  And it looks like the way that person grew it still. So again,
[24:57.840 --> 25:01.400]  I've been skeptical of genetic drift and I've played with a lot of plants,
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.800]  but since I'm writing a podcast, I have to come at it unbiased and open-minded.
[25:06.800 --> 25:11.800]  So I didn't want my opinion to get in the way of the opportunity to learn and
[25:11.840 --> 25:12.680]  also teach.
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.840]  So I did some Google research to open my mind and I totally rattled my current
[25:18.080 --> 25:18.920]  opinion.
[25:19.400 --> 25:24.400]  I found a wonderful article on CannabisIndustryInstitute.com by a guy named
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.120]  Randy Robinson about genetic drift. And I wanted to share what I learned.
[25:30.440 --> 25:31.480]  This article says,
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.120]  the true concept of genetic drift started in the 1920s.
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.640]  This was several decades after Darwin had already revolutionized biology with his
[25:40.640 --> 25:41.760]  theory of evolution,
[25:41.760 --> 25:45.280]  but scientists still didn't know how certain traits were passed on.
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.480]  We had some clues from Mendel's pea studies, excuse me,
[25:49.480 --> 25:54.040]  but Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution hadn't been combined yet.
[25:54.440 --> 25:55.160]  In the twenties,
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.280]  biologists recognized that certain genes and traits changed a population without
[25:59.520 --> 26:02.000]  any adaptive or environmental pressures.
[26:02.160 --> 26:03.880]  So that's where we need to make a note.
[26:04.120 --> 26:09.120]  Biologists recognized that certain genes and traits changed a population without
[26:10.200 --> 26:13.280]  any adaptive or environmental pressures. For example,
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.080]  let's say there are two types of the same bird species on an island,
[26:17.320 --> 26:19.800]  some with silver feathers and some with gold feathers.
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.400]  The color of their feathers confers no special survival advantages and the
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.120]  colors don't harm the birds either. So these colors are neutral mutations.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.920]  After studying these birds for several years,
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.480]  we noticed that the ratio of silver feathered birds to gold feather birds
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.160]  begins to change. There used to be a ratio of one silver to one gold,
[26:40.200 --> 26:43.040]  but now it's 10 silvers to one gold.
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.080]  Nothing happened on the island that should have selected one color of bird over
[26:47.100 --> 26:49.280]  the other. It just happened randomly.
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.360]  This is what is known as genetic drift. Today,
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.720]  population geneticists refer to genetic drift as sampling error.
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.560]  This is something that happens with real world populations.
[27:01.840 --> 27:03.840]  No sampling is ever perfect.
[27:04.480 --> 27:06.600]  And that's what we're seeing with genetic drift.
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.320]  The sampling error happens over and over again until it's amplified and becomes
[27:11.320 --> 27:15.160]  the most prevalent, or in some cases, the only gene.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.160]  Now what does genetic drift have to do with cloning? Probably nothing,
[27:20.200 --> 27:22.240]  because pay attention to this part.
[27:22.260 --> 27:26.600]  Genetic drift only applies to populations of organisms that produce
[27:26.720 --> 27:29.560]  sexually. So when we're talking about cloning cannabis,
[27:29.920 --> 27:32.720]  we're dealing with only one organism. Of course,
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.640]  we may produce thousands of copies of that individual plant,
[27:35.660 --> 27:40.720]  but it's still only one plant. So genetic drift does not apply.
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.240]  So you guys, all this time, we've been saying genetic drift from cloning.
[27:45.560 --> 27:50.680]  That's not even possible because genetic drift only applies to populations
[27:50.760 --> 27:55.800]  of organisms that reproduce sexually. So we are not doing that.
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.200]  We are cloning. There's no sexual reproduction here. So that can't even apply.
[28:00.200 --> 28:03.760]  Genetic drift is not even a label that can be applied to this situation.
[28:03.760 --> 28:05.680]  So that's where we're going to change some things today.
[28:06.120 --> 28:08.280]  And this was not my knowledge.
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.760]  This is our friend Randy in this article that wrote this here.
[28:10.780 --> 28:12.800]  So let's keep moving forward.
[28:13.880 --> 28:18.440]  The question of why all of plants clones aren't 100% the same is not easy to
[28:18.440 --> 28:22.360]  answer. Mainly because we haven't studied cannabis as much as we'd like,
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.440]  especially in large scale grows.
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.840]  Most of the research was performed in labs on lower potency plants and small
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.760]  sample sizes. However, we have taken a ton of research on other plants.
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.800]  It is possible that clones are themselves producing new genes or deleting old
[28:38.800 --> 28:41.040]  genes. Back in 2011,
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.480]  a study from Oxford university showed that no clone was a perfect copy.
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.200]  Genetic analysts showed that when genes regenerate new tissue,
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.400]  they tend to spontaneously create new genes. You guys hear that?
[28:54.760 --> 28:58.800]  When genes regenerate new tissue,
[28:58.960 --> 29:01.600]  they tend to spontaneously create new genes.
[29:01.840 --> 29:04.680]  It hasn't been confirmed whether or not cannabis does this,
[29:04.960 --> 29:09.200]  but it is possible. Now the Oxford study called the phenomenon,
[29:09.440 --> 29:11.400]  regenerative mutation.
[29:11.680 --> 29:15.200]  Some genes would be duplicated in the process while other genes were deleted
[29:15.200 --> 29:17.400]  from the clone altogether. However,
[29:17.420 --> 29:22.240]  this study looked at the Thale Cress plant and as similar as regenerative
[29:22.260 --> 29:26.960]  mutation and genetic drift may seem, there's still not the same thing.
[29:27.560 --> 29:29.840]  So that thing we've been calling genetic drift, you guys,
[29:29.880 --> 29:31.320]  we have got to change the word.
[29:31.340 --> 29:35.960]  I think that is more appropriately known as regenerative mutation is what's
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.600]  happening there. So let's move forward with this article.
[29:40.720 --> 29:44.160]  It says another reason we may see changes in some clones is stress.
[29:44.360 --> 29:46.720]  Stress doesn't change the genetic makeup of a clone,
[29:46.740 --> 29:50.480]  but it can change how its genes are expressed through a process called
[29:50.480 --> 29:54.080]  epigenetics, a relatively new field of biology.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.400]  Over the last few decades,
[29:55.400 --> 29:59.960]  we realized that DNA and genetic expression are not set in stone.
[30:00.240 --> 30:04.360]  The experiences of a parent can change the way their DNA is expressed and they
[30:04.360 --> 30:07.120]  can pass those changes onto their offspring.
[30:08.080 --> 30:11.280]  Epigenetics may explain why people who experienced severe trauma,
[30:11.300 --> 30:15.680]  such as war might beget children who are more prone to disease and mental
[30:15.680 --> 30:16.520]  illness.
[30:16.520 --> 30:20.200]  The stress changed the way the parents genes were expressed and those changes
[30:20.220 --> 30:24.120]  were passed on to their children. Again, the DNA itself didn't change,
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.280]  but little control mechanisms such as chemicals produced to the body or
[30:28.280 --> 30:29.640]  produced by the body, excuse me,
[30:29.840 --> 30:33.960]  changed whether those genes were turned on off or set to overdrive.
[30:34.560 --> 30:36.920]  What are these stress culprits in our cannabis plants?
[30:37.080 --> 30:39.440]  Sometimes a mother plant just gets old.
[30:39.680 --> 30:43.640]  Sometimes her feeding cycle has changed or she gets sick or injured or both.
[30:44.360 --> 30:48.080]  Some growers suspect the heavy use of synthetic fertilizers or hormones may
[30:48.080 --> 30:49.740]  epigenetically alter their mothers,
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.680]  causing the clones to lose some desired trait.
[30:53.200 --> 30:55.160]  When it comes to making clones, remember this,
[30:55.160 --> 30:58.120]  the act of cloning is a stressful act.
[30:58.160 --> 31:01.720]  You're damaging tissue by severing part of the plant from itself.
[31:02.120 --> 31:05.240]  Clones also get transplanted and transported all over the place,
[31:05.260 --> 31:08.560]  which can induce stress. Once this happens dozens,
[31:08.580 --> 31:10.800]  if not hundreds of times to a series of clones,
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.480]  we may end up with different qualities in our clones than we started with.
[31:15.880 --> 31:20.840]  Again, that article was from CannabisIndustryInstitute.com by Randy Robinson.
[31:21.040 --> 31:24.800]  I hope you guys learned as much as I did because I thought that article got
[31:24.800 --> 31:28.040]  right to the point. It taught me a lot and I really enjoyed it.
[31:28.080 --> 31:33.080]  So we can't say genetic drift anymore because genetic drift only happens in
[31:33.320 --> 31:35.400]  something that produces sexually.
[31:35.400 --> 31:40.040]  The new word is regenerative mutation, regenerative mutation.
[31:40.040 --> 31:43.280]  You guys drop that one in the clone room tomorrow when you're working and watch
[31:43.280 --> 31:46.000]  the lead grower look confused. Watch him look intimidated. Like, oh shit,
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.760]  this guy knows more than me. Also keep in mind,
[31:49.200 --> 31:50.960]  they mentioned the phrase sampling error.
[31:51.000 --> 31:55.200]  That's from people taking shitty clones or taking clones improperly or improper
[31:55.200 --> 31:58.120]  care of plants or taking a clone from an unhealthy mother plant.
[31:58.400 --> 31:59.480]  That's a sampling error.
[31:59.480 --> 32:03.280]  And also another cause for what we used to think was genetic drift.
[32:03.300 --> 32:05.600]  Now we're going to call it regenerative mutation.
[32:05.800 --> 32:09.000]  So that's a new conversation in the grow room. Have fun with that tomorrow.
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.080]  Now what we thought we were seeing may be happening,
[32:11.400 --> 32:15.040]  but we were just identifying it incorrectly. Again, it's not genetic drift,
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.720]  but a regenerative mutation.
[32:16.720 --> 32:18.880]  I would assume the health of the donor plant,
[32:19.160 --> 32:22.240]  the stress and experience of cloning, the environment,
[32:22.240 --> 32:23.800]  it's all got a lot to do with this process.
[32:23.800 --> 32:28.760]  I still suspect most of what we see as grower error or plant reaction to poor
[32:28.760 --> 32:33.560]  stress or poor environment or poor cloning technique or unclean cloning area.
[32:33.560 --> 32:36.960]  It's usually a vapor pressure deficit issue or pest or pathogen issue,
[32:37.320 --> 32:39.600]  if not some sort of shock during the cloning process.
[32:39.600 --> 32:43.280]  We basically we're grabbing a plant and we're amputating the arm and we're
[32:43.280 --> 32:44.480]  trying to make it regrow.
[32:45.240 --> 32:48.280]  So we give a lot of opportunity for problems during cloning.
[32:48.280 --> 32:50.160]  Imagine if I cut off your arm in the clone room, right?
[32:50.160 --> 32:53.080]  Go think about wherever you take clones, stand in the middle there.
[32:53.520 --> 32:56.560]  Now I'm just going to grab a giant fucking knife and I'm going to cut your arm
[32:56.560 --> 33:01.560]  off. Now, would you feel clean and safe with an open wound in that room?
[33:01.560 --> 33:03.640]  Are you cool with that? Like, are you going to be like, yeah,
[33:03.640 --> 33:06.480]  this is totally sanitary. Go ahead and set my arm on that table.
[33:06.720 --> 33:08.600]  Like do you think that table where you set your clones,
[33:08.600 --> 33:11.280]  do you think that's cool for your freshly amputated arm?
[33:11.600 --> 33:13.480]  Like do you think that's going to be all right? Do you?
[33:13.960 --> 33:18.680]  And then also would you want me to cut your arm off while you're feeling strong
[33:18.680 --> 33:22.200]  and healthy? Like, let me give you a month to work out and get fucking tough.
[33:22.200 --> 33:24.600]  To where when you cut it off, you still got like some strength to you.
[33:24.600 --> 33:27.640]  Maybe we could get it stapled back on or something and we can get it to
[33:27.640 --> 33:30.320]  regenerate because you're still young and you're still healthy and you just got
[33:30.320 --> 33:31.880]  super strong and you've been eating well.
[33:32.280 --> 33:36.000]  Or do you want us to wait until you're 90 years old and cut your arm off and try
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.360]  to super glue and staple that bitch back on when you're using most of your
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.560]  energy just to live because you haven't been eating well and your body's all
[33:42.560 --> 33:45.720]  frail by now. So think about where the clones come from.
[33:45.720 --> 33:49.840]  The best way to prevent regenerative mutation is to keep healthy mother plants.
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.640]  Take your clones from healthy mother plants,
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.600]  have a sterile cloning area and a solid cloning method.
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.440]  Write some SOPs, go read some cloning techniques.
[33:58.680 --> 34:02.320]  I'll put out another cloning podcast very soon here. I've got one out already.
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.200]  I plan on putting out a revised cloning episode here in just a few
[34:07.200 --> 34:10.520]  weeks. So if you see your mother plant getting weak,
[34:10.600 --> 34:12.920]  cut some clones right away for safekeeping.
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.480]  As soon as you see her looking shitty, just take a few clones.
[34:15.680 --> 34:17.880]  I'm always pulling clones off of plants all the time anyway,
[34:17.880 --> 34:20.920]  just to have fresh mother plants, just to keep the cycle going. Uh,
[34:20.920 --> 34:23.960]  sometimes I know that I'm going to want a whole bunch of this plant.
[34:23.960 --> 34:27.480]  So I'll cut like four clones of that and I'll veg those out to get them kind of
[34:27.480 --> 34:27.760]  big.
[34:27.760 --> 34:30.240]  And then I'll take all my clones off of those four and they just become
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.800]  sacrificial plants. They die. But then I've got tons of clones from them.
[34:34.080 --> 34:35.880]  Just get good at cloning,
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.760]  get good at identifying problems in your mother plants and have timing and know
[34:39.960 --> 34:41.680]  when that mother plant starting to burn out.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.720]  But you also have to be able to tell if you've got issues. Do you have spider
[34:44.720 --> 34:47.480]  mites? Do you have russet mites? Do you have something eating at the roots?
[34:47.480 --> 34:51.240]  Do you have a problem making that mother plant get tired? So figure that out.
[34:51.400 --> 34:54.360]  And if it looks like she's healthy and she's just burning out on you,
[34:54.720 --> 34:55.520]  clone off of her,
[34:55.560 --> 34:58.360]  get some plenty of clones and then get those clones rooted,
[34:58.360 --> 34:59.800]  put them under a lot of light,
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.040]  feed them very well and get those back to super health.
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.080]  And then clone off of those for your next run.
[35:06.360 --> 35:08.960]  Also, if you're doing the clone off your veg plants,
[35:08.960 --> 35:12.360]  clone off your veg plants, clone off your veg plants. Again, same thing.
[35:12.360 --> 35:15.320]  Just make sure your veg plants are super healthy. You know what I mean?
[35:15.320 --> 35:17.840]  If you're doing it, you grow your veg plants right before you flower.
[35:17.840 --> 35:21.000]  You take a couple clones off of those. Those become the next generation.
[35:21.320 --> 35:24.120]  You put everything into flower except your little clones. The clones root,
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.080]  those become the next generation. You take a couple of clones off of those,
[35:27.080 --> 35:29.840]  put them into the flower room. You guys understand how it goes.
[35:30.040 --> 35:32.800]  So that's how a lot of perpetual grows work. You guys,
[35:32.920 --> 35:35.960]  you're not going to get problems if you do things correctly.
[35:35.960 --> 35:37.240]  If you keep everybody healthy,
[35:37.760 --> 35:42.040]  it'll take a long time to cause regenerative mutation problems.
[35:42.720 --> 35:44.960]  All right, you guys, that is my report on genetic drift.
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.560]  Now known as regenerative mutation. I hope you learned as much as I did.
[35:49.120 --> 35:52.600]  Visit the website where I found the article that is cannabisindustryinstitute.com.
[35:54.560 --> 35:56.800]  They have a lot of great informative articles.
[35:56.800 --> 36:00.640]  This was the first time I visited the website, but it will not be the last.
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.360]  All right, podcast world. I'm going to start wrapping up the show.

[37:13.280 --> 37:16.520]  I'm going to give a huge happy birthday shout out to my buddy Gibbs.
[37:16.720 --> 37:20.280]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[37:36.680 --> 37:51.680]  So we do that by having a mother plant. Holy shit.
[37:51.680 --> 37:53.480]  A spider just fell out of the sky at me.
[37:53.920 --> 37:57.360]  Well, that's a little clip we're going to have to fucking save for the end of the show or put somewhere.
[37:57.360 --> 37:58.240]  That was interesting.
