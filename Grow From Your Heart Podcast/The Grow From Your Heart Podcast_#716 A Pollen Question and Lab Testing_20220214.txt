[00:03.000 --> 00:26.250]  Alright, here we go.
[00:26.250 --> 00:27.850]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:27.850 --> 00:28.850]  I'm your host.
[00:28.850 --> 00:30.530]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:30.530 --> 00:35.510]  This is episode 716 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.510 --> 00:38.390]  In this episode, I'm going to read more listener emails.
[00:38.390 --> 00:41.870]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:41.870 --> 00:46.090]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:46.090 --> 00:49.970]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Kana
[00:49.970 --> 00:51.730]  Organic Illinois.
[00:51.730 --> 00:55.170]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Levity Love Day and Yannick Bucci.
[00:55.170 --> 00:58.750]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, our friend
[00:58.750 --> 01:00.610]  Nomi by my guacamole.
[01:00.610 --> 01:03.650]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my good friend Dave's Not Here.

[01:15.150 --> 01:16.150]  Heart TV.
[01:16.150 --> 01:20.430]  Then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:20.430 --> 01:22.530]  to Terp Burglar.
[01:22.530 --> 01:27.470]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:27.470 --> 01:31.150]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:31.150 --> 01:37.310]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:37.310 --> 01:39.890]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:39.890 --> 01:44.030]  Of course, I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:44.030 --> 01:47.170]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:47.170 --> 01:50.590]  All right, I don't want to ramble too much on this episode.
[01:50.590 --> 01:52.710]  In the last show, I got going pretty good.
[01:52.710 --> 01:54.610]  We didn't answer very many questions.
[01:54.610 --> 01:55.610]  Let's get right to it.
[01:55.610 --> 01:57.310]  I've got a grow question for you.
[01:57.310 --> 02:01.170]  If you have a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question, I would love to hear
[02:01.170 --> 02:02.170]  from you.
[02:02.170 --> 02:04.770]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:04.770 --> 02:05.810]  Don't be shy.
[02:05.810 --> 02:10.350]  The first message in today's episode came from our friend Jamie and it says in the subject
[02:10.350 --> 02:14.190]  line, I heard you say THC percentage doesn't mean anything.
[02:14.190 --> 02:15.750]  I would like to learn why.
[02:15.750 --> 02:17.150]  Can you point me to an episode?
[02:17.150 --> 02:21.550]  There is not an episode yet, but now there will be an episode to teach you why I feel
[02:21.550 --> 02:22.550]  odd.
[02:22.550 --> 02:26.710]  I don't mean the THC percentage doesn't mean anything, but there's more to this message.
[02:26.710 --> 02:27.710]  Let's just read it.
[02:27.710 --> 02:30.430]  It says, I do believe you and I'm not challenging you in any way.
[02:30.430 --> 02:32.510]  I just want to understand why you said that.
[02:32.510 --> 02:36.730]  Then he does talk about some more stuff, which we don't need to discuss here on the podcast,
[02:36.730 --> 02:39.250]  just talking about branding and other things.
[02:39.250 --> 02:41.490]  Our friend Jamie asked the question.
[02:41.490 --> 02:46.210]  Apparently, obviously somewhere either on Instagram live, on social media, or perhaps
[02:46.210 --> 02:52.310]  right here on this show, I did say that THC percentage does not matter.
[02:52.310 --> 02:56.070]  It does matter a little bit, but it is not the deciding factor.
[02:56.070 --> 03:01.410]  It should not be the deciding factor when it comes to buying your medical or recreational
[03:01.510 --> 03:06.870]  cannabis products, whether it's your flowers, your dabs, whatever you're buying, the THC
[03:06.870 --> 03:09.750]  percentage should not be the number one factor.
[03:09.750 --> 03:13.350]  I do have a few notes here and we'll talk about why.
[03:13.350 --> 03:19.630]  The main reason why being immersed in the industry, being deeply involved in the industry,
[03:19.630 --> 03:27.150]  having experience, I know that the tests themselves are very easily manipulatable.
[03:27.150 --> 03:29.270]  You can manipulate those tests very easily.
[03:29.330 --> 03:32.850]  You guys can translate that however it should have been done.
[03:32.850 --> 03:35.750]  I know how to make a lab test come out better.
[03:35.750 --> 03:37.370]  It has nothing to do with the lab.
[03:37.370 --> 03:38.850]  Many people say they just pay the lab.
[03:38.850 --> 03:39.850]  No, they don't.
[03:39.850 --> 03:41.670]  Everybody would just be paying the lab.
[03:41.670 --> 03:43.970]  Everybody would have 45% THC.
[03:43.970 --> 03:45.510]  That's what everybody would do.
[03:45.510 --> 03:46.510]  That's not a thing.
[03:46.510 --> 03:47.510]  You cannot pay the lab.
[03:47.510 --> 03:50.250]  What you can do, you can manipulate a lab test.
[03:50.250 --> 03:51.250]  I know how to do it.
[03:51.250 --> 03:53.410]  I'm not going to teach you how to do it here.
[03:53.410 --> 03:58.010]  It's very easy to increase the potency of the samples which you were sending to the labs.
[03:58.790 --> 04:03.910]  In Colorado, there's supposed to be a very strict guideline, a standard operating procedure
[04:03.910 --> 04:06.390]  of how the sample should be taken.
[04:06.390 --> 04:10.350]  However, there's nothing forcing you to do it that way.
[04:10.350 --> 04:14.950]  If you're smart, if you're smooth, if you don't follow all of the rules, you can make
[04:14.950 --> 04:18.470]  the lab tests appear much better than what they are.
[04:18.470 --> 04:24.870]  The first reason why I don't trust a lab test is they're very easily manipulated.
[04:24.870 --> 04:26.470]  That doesn't work well for me.
[04:26.490 --> 04:30.370]  If I know that I can easily manipulate it and teach employees how to get better lab
[04:30.370 --> 04:32.710]  tests, then anybody out there can do it.
[04:32.710 --> 04:35.570]  We can all figure it out.
[04:35.570 --> 04:36.810]  It's all about prepping the sample.
[04:36.810 --> 04:40.970]  If you take the sample certain ways, certain spaces, do certain things to it, you can definitely
[04:40.970 --> 04:43.050]  manipulate that test.
[04:43.050 --> 04:49.570]  Then, also THC is not the only thing that matters when you are smoking.
[04:49.570 --> 04:55.850]  I've smoked ... What matters is the combination of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds
[04:55.950 --> 04:59.470]  that all work together to give you the desired effect.
[04:59.470 --> 05:02.270]  I can go right now to many dispensaries.
[05:02.270 --> 05:04.790]  There's a dispensary 10 miles that way, four miles that way.
[05:04.790 --> 05:06.950]  They're everywhere where I am right now.
[05:06.950 --> 05:14.030]  I can go just a few miles and I can buy 99%, 98% THC-A diamonds that's just straight up
[05:14.030 --> 05:15.230]  THC.
[05:15.230 --> 05:16.590]  They're available.
[05:16.590 --> 05:22.690]  Right next to them for half the price is Green Dot Batter, Green Dot Full Spectrum Diamonds
[05:22.690 --> 05:25.430]  and Sauce, plenty of other company stuff.
[05:26.010 --> 05:30.890]  I prefer the Green Dot Batter because I prefer the other stuff in the mix.
[05:30.890 --> 05:33.250]  I don't just want the THC.
[05:33.250 --> 05:38.030]  The THC is a small part of it, but those other things in there really ... I've described
[05:38.030 --> 05:39.410]  it as this before.
[05:39.410 --> 05:41.290]  When I take ... I've hit the THC-A.
[05:41.290 --> 05:42.290]  I've hit a lot of it.
[05:42.290 --> 05:44.290]  I bought a big old ... They used to sell it in carats.
[05:44.290 --> 05:48.170]  When the stuff got popular, there was a dispensary just selling big diamonds of it.
[05:48.170 --> 05:50.130]  They thought it ... We all thought it was awesome.
[05:50.230 --> 05:55.550]  I'm bored with it now because I've realized that when I take a dab of that, no matter
[05:55.550 --> 05:58.030]  how big it is, I get super high.
[05:58.030 --> 05:59.190]  My high goes up.
[05:59.190 --> 06:01.210]  Think of it ... This is how I'm going to describe it.
[06:01.210 --> 06:02.830]  Think of it as a firework.
[06:02.830 --> 06:08.070]  When you smoke THC or THC-A, that's your lift off from your fireworks.
[06:08.070 --> 06:09.070]  You're going to go up.
[06:09.070 --> 06:10.230]  Of course, you're going to go up.
[06:10.230 --> 06:12.430]  That's what your THC is going to make you do.
[06:12.430 --> 06:15.110]  The more THC-A, the more THC.
[06:15.110 --> 06:18.230]  Probably the higher up you're going to go, but you're just going to go up.
[06:18.330 --> 06:22.370]  The terpenes, the esters, the paleates, the flavonoids, all of those other things that
[06:22.370 --> 06:27.490]  are in there are the things that contribute to the color of your fireworks.
[06:27.490 --> 06:31.890]  Another way I'm going to put that is that's what gives you the munchies.
[06:31.890 --> 06:33.210]  That's what gives you the giggles.
[06:33.210 --> 06:34.670]  That's what gives you paranoia.
[06:34.670 --> 06:36.170]  That's what gives you pain relief.
[06:36.170 --> 06:39.530]  That's what gives you ... Sometimes when I dab, I got to poop.
[06:39.530 --> 06:41.450]  Sometimes it makes me hungry.
[06:41.450 --> 06:43.810]  Lots of different things happen from different strains.
[06:43.810 --> 06:47.090]  Sometimes the same strain will have a lot of different effects on me.
[06:47.110 --> 06:52.070]  I think a lot of that is from the other compounds, not just the THC.
[06:52.070 --> 06:54.030]  The THC is great in there.
[06:54.030 --> 06:55.950]  That's what's going to make me go up.
[06:55.950 --> 07:00.270]  I know I can mess with the lab test to make it look like there's a lot of THC in there.
[07:00.270 --> 07:02.150]  I know that I need all those other things.
[07:02.150 --> 07:07.910]  We've called it the entourage effect, the synergistic effect, the full spectrum effect.
[07:07.910 --> 07:14.030]  We need all those other components to actually make the buzz more enjoyable, more medicated,
[07:14.030 --> 07:16.230]  more medical.
[07:16.250 --> 07:18.450]  For me, it's a recreational enjoyment.
[07:18.450 --> 07:24.530]  I enjoy ... You could give me all the diamonds and set them right here, pure THCA crystals,
[07:24.530 --> 07:27.470]  and you could give me a bunch of Green Dot Labs batter.
[07:27.470 --> 07:31.410]  Give me some of that GMO batter, maybe some of that Picasso or the DALI.
[07:31.410 --> 07:32.690]  The DALI is the one I really like.
[07:32.690 --> 07:36.970]  Give me the DALI batter or maybe some of their live rosin even.
[07:36.970 --> 07:39.690]  I'm going to smoke that over the diamonds 90% of the time.
[07:39.690 --> 07:44.970]  I may take some of the diamonds over here, the THCA crystals, and maybe crunch them up
[07:45.030 --> 07:49.510]  and sprinkle, take a dab of the batter and just coat it, like put sprinkles on the outside
[07:49.510 --> 07:54.170]  of it with the THCA diamonds, the little crystals, the shiny parts.
[07:54.170 --> 07:55.390]  That's going to make it taste better.
[07:55.390 --> 07:59.190]  That's going to give it a better buzz, and it's just going to increase the THCA or the
[07:59.190 --> 08:00.190]  THC.
[08:00.190 --> 08:01.190]  I'm not sure.
[08:01.190 --> 08:02.190]  I keep saying A or THC.
[08:02.190 --> 08:03.190]  I didn't write it down.
[08:03.190 --> 08:05.990]  But I feel like when I smoke that, I can only get so high.
[08:05.990 --> 08:06.990]  I start getting the sweats.
[08:06.990 --> 08:08.510]  I start to get a headache.
[08:08.510 --> 08:12.070]  But if you put the other stuff with it, you give it some terps mainly.
[08:12.070 --> 08:14.110]  You give it that flavor, that other stuff.
[08:14.250 --> 08:15.410]  Then you get a really nice buzz.
[08:15.410 --> 08:17.530]  You can really achieve something.
[08:17.530 --> 08:19.890]  It's almost harsh and too much.
[08:19.890 --> 08:22.250]  Too much THC by itself.
[08:22.250 --> 08:23.690]  The dabs, they burn my throat.
[08:23.690 --> 08:24.690]  They burn my lungs.
[08:24.690 --> 08:26.730]  It's not a desirable dab.
[08:26.730 --> 08:30.810]  You have to get it hotter than a normal dab, so that's also a little bit uncomfortable.
[08:30.810 --> 08:34.810]  Then on top of that, it kind of burns your throat on the way in, burns the lungs.
[08:34.810 --> 08:35.810]  Then it gives me a headache.
[08:35.810 --> 08:39.770]  I feel like when I come down from it, it gives me ... It's not desirable.
[08:39.770 --> 08:40.770]  It's like a headache.
[08:40.770 --> 08:41.770]  It's the best way I can describe it.
[08:41.790 --> 08:45.710]  It may not be the worst headache, but I can feel a lingering thing that it was like my
[08:45.710 --> 08:47.350]  body's going, yeah, where's the other part?
[08:47.350 --> 08:50.790]  You need the other part to make this work.
[08:50.790 --> 08:52.470]  That's my opinion on the THC-A diamonds.
[08:52.470 --> 08:57.350]  I think that that is what I meant when I said that THC is not the only thing.
[08:57.350 --> 09:04.230]  It matters, but it shouldn't be ... What happens is ... I said the test, I can manipulate the
[09:04.230 --> 09:05.230]  test.
[09:05.230 --> 09:07.310]  What's going to happen is I run a commercial grow.
[09:07.310 --> 09:09.750]  I take the samples or I manipulate the samples.
[09:09.750 --> 09:10.750]  We send them to the lab.
[09:10.750 --> 09:12.730]  They come back with impressive results.
[09:12.730 --> 09:16.990]  We put that on the jar or on the advertising at the dispensary.
[09:16.990 --> 09:21.090]  That draws a clientele, the clientele that just shops for THC percentage.
[09:21.090 --> 09:24.350]  Since we know that's going to work, we just mark that one up five more dollars an eighth
[09:24.350 --> 09:25.350]  or whatever.
[09:25.350 --> 09:27.610]  I don't work in that department, but I know that that's how it works.
[09:27.610 --> 09:33.010]  I go to the dispensaries and I see the flowers and I see the shit that's marked like 18%
[09:33.010 --> 09:35.370]  THC and below is one price point.
[09:35.370 --> 09:39.410]  18 to 22 is another and then 22 and up, that's the top shelf stuff.
[09:39.430 --> 09:41.870]  They charge you more for that.
[09:41.870 --> 09:44.710]  It's kind of just a ... Who knows if that number is even accurate.
[09:44.710 --> 09:49.270]  They tested ... You're supposed to test a couple of buds out of the batch, but you might
[09:49.270 --> 09:50.630]  be running a two pound batch.
[09:50.630 --> 09:54.510]  You could be running a 50 pound batch of the same product and the tests are going to be
[09:54.510 --> 10:00.510]  very inconsistent among that whole spectrum of all that flower and that big ass bin.
[10:00.510 --> 10:03.150]  I really do love lab testing.
[10:03.150 --> 10:04.910]  I love a lot of it.
[10:04.910 --> 10:10.730]  But also, the labs are allowed to have a plus or minus 10% threshold.
[10:10.730 --> 10:17.330]  When I say that this flower is 30% THC, it could be 20, it could be 40.
[10:17.330 --> 10:23.390]  10% ... Especially when most of our samples are coming around the 25 to 30%.
[10:23.390 --> 10:26.250]  How do I know they're not 15 to 35 to 40%?
[10:26.250 --> 10:28.330]  That's something that I should keep in mind.
[10:28.330 --> 10:30.610]  I'm going to check my notes.
[10:30.610 --> 10:32.250]  We are all machines.
[10:32.250 --> 10:33.730]  The machines love THCA.
[10:33.750 --> 10:34.750]  They love that.
[10:34.750 --> 10:39.470]  The high pressure liquid chromatography machine loves to show you that it's got a lot of THC
[10:39.470 --> 10:40.550]  in the test.
[10:40.550 --> 10:41.670]  Our bodies aren't machines.
[10:41.670 --> 10:46.470]  We need all of the other components to make that more desirable, in my opinion.
[10:46.470 --> 10:51.870]  Also, this is a joke I love to make.
[10:51.870 --> 10:53.270]  Machines never buy another eighth.
[10:53.270 --> 10:57.230]  I've never had a machine come back and say, bro, that hit really high numbers.
[10:57.230 --> 10:58.470]  Can I get another quarter?
[10:58.470 --> 10:59.510]  A machine has never done that.
[10:59.510 --> 11:03.490]  I've had a lot of people come back and say, dude, I smoked that bag so fast.
[11:03.490 --> 11:04.690]  Can I get another quarter?
[11:04.690 --> 11:05.930]  That's stuff that has happened.
[11:05.930 --> 11:07.850]  The machines ... I like the machines.
[11:07.850 --> 11:08.850]  I love the testing.
[11:08.850 --> 11:09.850]  It's great.
[11:09.850 --> 11:10.850]  They're great.
[11:10.850 --> 11:11.850]  What are they called?
[11:11.850 --> 11:12.850]  Markers?
[11:12.850 --> 11:17.890]  Yeah, it's like a marker, just a marker, a data point is maybe what it is.
[11:17.890 --> 11:19.730]  It's not that I'm a body, I'm a person.
[11:19.730 --> 11:20.810]  We're all different.
[11:20.810 --> 11:27.010]  The machines don't care if you like more THC, more CBD, more limonene, more mercine.
[11:27.010 --> 11:28.010]  The machines don't care.
[11:28.010 --> 11:30.470]  I've seen lots of THC and that we're not a machine.
[11:30.470 --> 11:31.470]  You need all the other stuff.
[11:31.470 --> 11:32.470]  All right, I think I'm rambling.
[11:32.470 --> 11:33.910]  Let me check my notes.
[11:33.910 --> 11:36.350]  THC percentage is a good selling point.
[11:36.350 --> 11:37.610]  It's a good guideline.
[11:37.610 --> 11:39.070]  It's a good idea.
[11:39.070 --> 11:44.110]  It's something to keep in mind when shopping, but it should not be the definitive end all
[11:44.110 --> 11:49.950]  be all decision maker when you are buying your medical or recreational cannabis products.
[11:49.950 --> 11:50.950]  I've done another episode.
[11:50.950 --> 11:52.570]  I'm going to get on a side tangent here.
[11:52.570 --> 11:55.310]  Another episode, I think it's called Follow Your Nose.
[11:55.310 --> 11:57.030]  I've done a updated episode on it.
[11:57.050 --> 11:58.050]  I'm sure.
[11:58.050 --> 11:59.290]  Follow your nose.
[11:59.290 --> 12:02.650]  When you're buying, smell the shit.
[12:02.650 --> 12:03.650]  That's a good comment right there.
[12:03.650 --> 12:04.650]  Smell the shit.
[12:04.650 --> 12:06.290]  Also, smell the flowers.
[12:06.290 --> 12:10.290]  When you smell things, 90% of the time, when you smell something and your body goes, oh,
[12:10.290 --> 12:12.330]  that's bad, you shouldn't consume it.
[12:12.330 --> 12:17.050]  When you smell something and your body goes, oh yeah, you should be consuming that.
[12:17.050 --> 12:19.690]  Oranges, smell good because they're good for you.
[12:19.690 --> 12:22.450]  Poop smells bad because you probably shouldn't eat that.
[12:22.450 --> 12:23.450]  Somebody already ate it.
[12:23.450 --> 12:25.170]  That's all their waste.
[12:25.190 --> 12:27.750]  The doctor did that on purpose for us.
[12:27.750 --> 12:31.630]  That's a blessing and a trait and a skill that we were given.
[12:31.630 --> 12:35.070]  When you drive past the restaurant and they're cooking whatever, whatever your favorite restaurant
[12:35.070 --> 12:38.430]  is, and you smell it out there and you go, oh, I need some of that.
[12:38.430 --> 12:40.190]  Your body craves it because it's good for you.
[12:40.190 --> 12:41.190]  It's going to nourish you.
[12:41.190 --> 12:44.350]  It might be some fast food or whatever, but it's going to satisfy your body.
[12:44.350 --> 12:48.070]  You've been programmed to think that's good for you, but still your body smells good stuff
[12:48.070 --> 12:50.390]  that's good for you that you're supposed to eat.
[12:50.390 --> 12:54.110]  You smell that pie bacon or that cake bacon, those cookies being baked and you go, I need
[12:54.130 --> 12:55.450]  to eat a hot cookie.
[12:55.450 --> 12:57.570]  I'm going to burn my mouth with that cookie.
[12:57.570 --> 12:59.290]  It's so fresh out of the oven, but it's so good.
[12:59.290 --> 13:00.890]  I'm going to burn myself with a chocolate chip.
[13:00.890 --> 13:02.250]  I cannot wait.
[13:02.250 --> 13:03.690]  That's the kind of stuff your body does.
[13:03.690 --> 13:06.370]  And then somebody farts and you want to walk away because you go, that's gross.
[13:06.370 --> 13:07.370]  It stinks, bro.
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.370]  Your body is trained to do that.
[13:08.370 --> 13:12.450]  So when you go to buy cannabis, when you go to buy concentrates, try to give it a smell.
[13:12.450 --> 13:13.450]  Smell a few things.
[13:13.450 --> 13:14.450]  Don't be shy.
[13:14.450 --> 13:15.650]  Take your time at the dispensary.
[13:15.650 --> 13:18.210]  You're going to give them your money and that's what they're there for.
[13:18.210 --> 13:19.490]  They're there to help you.
[13:19.490 --> 13:21.050]  You're not bothering anybody.
[13:21.050 --> 13:25.230]  doing your job at the dispensary, which is finding the product that is proper for you.
[13:25.230 --> 13:26.230]  Take your time.
[13:26.230 --> 13:27.230]  Don't ever let a bud tender.
[13:27.230 --> 13:28.590]  I'm going to weigh big tangent now.
[13:28.590 --> 13:32.710]  Don't ever let a bud tender or a patient behind you, a customer behind you, make you feel
[13:32.710 --> 13:35.110]  like you need to be rushed at the dispensary.
[13:35.110 --> 13:36.150]  Treat it like you're at the bank.
[13:36.150 --> 13:39.790]  Write all your notes you need to write, write down the numbers, cross your eyes, doctor
[13:39.790 --> 13:41.450]  T's, sign your name in the right spot.
[13:41.450 --> 13:43.950]  Make sure all the zeros and decimals are in the right place.
[13:43.950 --> 13:45.350]  Get what you need at the dispensary.
[13:45.350 --> 13:46.350]  Leave satisfied.
[13:46.350 --> 13:47.970]  You're spending your hard earned money.
[13:47.970 --> 13:48.970]  Money is expensive.
[13:48.970 --> 13:51.470]  That bud tender is there to do their job, which is to help you.
[13:51.470 --> 13:52.470]  They're there on the clock.
[13:52.470 --> 13:54.750]  No matter how long you take, they're getting paid.
[13:54.750 --> 13:56.310]  Also tip your bud tender.
[13:56.310 --> 13:59.070]  If you can afford it, if they help you out, if they take good care of you, tip them.
[13:59.070 --> 14:00.350]  I've got a bud tender friend.
[14:00.350 --> 14:02.590]  I don't need to say his name because he knows who he is.
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.990]  I take good care of him.
[14:03.990 --> 14:08.430]  When they get drops at my favorite dispensary, he messages me and he says, Hey bro, I'm here.
[14:08.430 --> 14:09.430]  We just got this.
[14:09.430 --> 14:11.670]  And I get a picture of all the new cool shit that came.
[14:11.670 --> 14:13.030]  And I'm like, you know, I'm going to need this.
[14:13.030 --> 14:15.470]  And he sends me a picture and he's like, bro, I already knew what you were going to need.
[14:15.470 --> 14:16.470]  It's already stashed.
[14:16.470 --> 14:17.470]  I'm not going to worry.
[14:17.470 --> 14:19.490]  So big up to my friends who take good care of me like that.
[14:19.490 --> 14:23.410]  If you tip your bud tenders, they will take good care of you and stash the good shit for
[14:23.410 --> 14:24.410]  you.
[14:24.410 --> 14:25.410]  Take good care of you.
[14:25.410 --> 14:27.530]  Um, don't rely on those numbers when you go to the dispensary.
[14:27.530 --> 14:30.590]  That's what I think I was getting at.
[14:30.590 --> 14:32.830]  Be sure to smell the jars.
[14:32.830 --> 14:33.830]  Look at all the buds.
[14:33.830 --> 14:37.770]  Look at the shapes, the smells, or the shapes, the colors, the textures of the bud.
[14:37.770 --> 14:38.990]  Something's going to get your attention.
[14:38.990 --> 14:43.230]  Just like when you're looking at the menu at your favorite restaurant or at a new restaurant,
[14:43.230 --> 14:45.770]  you're looking at it and you're going, Oh, they got this.
[14:46.070 --> 14:48.950]  For me, it's just a bunch of random vegetarian shit you guys have never heard of.
[14:48.950 --> 14:53.050]  But vegetarian item one with this vegetarian to spicy vegetarian.
[14:53.050 --> 14:54.050]  That's my style.
[14:54.050 --> 14:55.050]  Savory vegetarian.
[14:55.050 --> 14:56.750]  Ooh, that's my style right there.
[14:56.750 --> 15:00.430]  One of them will jump out and then you'll, you'll decide the cannabis will do that.
[15:00.430 --> 15:04.870]  If you go and smell the jars, follow your nose because your nose knows what you're going
[15:04.870 --> 15:05.870]  to enjoy.
[15:05.870 --> 15:07.550]  If it doesn't smell good, you're not going to want to smoke it.
[15:07.550 --> 15:10.150]  And if you don't want to smoke it, how are you going to enjoy it?
[15:10.150 --> 15:12.990]  If it smells, smells delightful, you're going to smoke it.
[15:12.990 --> 15:13.990]  You're going to blow it out.
[15:13.990 --> 15:14.990]  You're going to squint your eyes.
[15:15.210 --> 15:20.410]  It tastes so good and you're going to get a nice buzz from it because your nose knows
[15:20.410 --> 15:23.490]  just like our old friend, toucan Sam used to teach us.
[15:23.490 --> 15:24.490]  Follow your nose.
[15:24.490 --> 15:26.530]  It always knows your nose is right.
[15:26.530 --> 15:27.610]  The turps are there.
[15:27.610 --> 15:28.770]  That's what your nose is for.
[15:28.770 --> 15:29.770]  Follow your senses.
[15:29.770 --> 15:30.770]  Follow your gut.
[15:30.770 --> 15:31.770]  How long have we been going?
[15:31.770 --> 15:32.770]  Not long enough.
[15:32.770 --> 15:33.770]  Let's go for another question.
[15:33.770 --> 15:36.330]  My friend, Jamie, I hope I've answered your question.
[15:36.330 --> 15:38.650]  THC numbers are great.
[15:38.650 --> 15:40.650]  But also what about the turps bro?
[15:40.650 --> 15:43.530]  And I'm going to go on a really quick side tangent turps.
[15:43.550 --> 15:47.950]  He sent me a lab report and they said, bro, there was this much percent turps in your
[15:47.950 --> 15:48.950]  flowers.
[15:48.950 --> 15:53.110]  They're trying to say there's like 25% mercine in my flowers.
[15:53.110 --> 15:56.190]  Let me translate those terpene reports for you quite quickly.
[15:56.190 --> 16:02.350]  A lot of times when you get a terpene report, they're showing you the, when it says 25%
[16:02.350 --> 16:07.470]  mercine, 10% limonene, 5% other terp, I don't want to get ahead of myself.
[16:07.470 --> 16:14.650]  They're not saying that the overall sample you gave them contained 25% limonene or mercine.
[16:14.650 --> 16:19.890]  What they're saying in that report is that there were, was a sample out of all of the
[16:19.890 --> 16:21.890]  turps derived from that sample.
[16:21.890 --> 16:26.210]  25% of the overall turps were this component.
[16:26.210 --> 16:28.610]  I don't remember the turps I named because I'm ahead of myself again.
[16:28.610 --> 16:30.330]  But so don't get confused.
[16:30.330 --> 16:35.090]  It's there when they do the sample, they'll say this much of the overall product was terpenes.
[16:35.090 --> 16:36.090]  It's going to be low.
[16:36.110 --> 16:39.670]  It's going to be like one to 4% probably like that's, that's good terpenes.
[16:39.670 --> 16:41.150]  But like that's run do work.
[16:41.150 --> 16:42.150]  That's impressive.
[16:42.150 --> 16:43.150]  That's good.
[16:43.150 --> 16:49.750]  Um, but of those 4% now you've got a hundred percent of your terpenes, 4% of your overall
[16:49.750 --> 16:51.070]  flower was turps.
[16:51.070 --> 16:57.930]  Now you've got that now 25% of that is where your limonene is going to be your 10% mercine.
[16:57.930 --> 17:04.230]  So don't get confused and say my sample was 25% limonene and 35% THCA because then what
[17:04.230 --> 17:05.230]  else do you have?
[17:05.370 --> 17:09.090]  You've got like 40%, 35% sludge to carry that in.
[17:09.090 --> 17:10.090]  It's got to be bud.
[17:10.090 --> 17:13.290]  It's got to be chlorophyll and green leafy matter at that point.
[17:13.290 --> 17:17.090]  So read those lab tests correctly.
[17:17.090 --> 17:18.090]  Now let me move on.
[17:18.090 --> 17:19.210]  I do have another great question.
[17:19.210 --> 17:21.410]  I got a big pile of questions in front of me.
[17:21.410 --> 17:24.050]  Is this the one that I wanted to read for this episode?
[17:24.050 --> 17:26.850]  Sure this one will work very well.
[17:26.850 --> 17:28.250]  Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[17:28.250 --> 17:29.830]  Probably not even going to edit that.
[17:29.830 --> 17:33.290]  This one came from our friend Adam and it says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[17:33.290 --> 17:34.290]  What's up Adam?
[17:34.350 --> 17:35.350]  What's up bro?
[17:35.350 --> 17:37.010]  It says, Hey man, I love the podcast.
[17:37.010 --> 17:39.190]  It's very entertaining and informative.
[17:39.190 --> 17:40.190]  Thank you.
[17:40.190 --> 17:41.750]  That is absolutely the goal here.
[17:41.750 --> 17:43.550]  Also a little bit of education.
[17:43.550 --> 17:45.430]  Says nothing better than hearing you ramble.
[17:45.430 --> 17:46.910]  Dude this is the episode for you.
[17:46.910 --> 17:50.030]  I said I was going to try to not ramble, fail.
[17:50.030 --> 17:51.890]  It says it's the best part of the show.
[17:51.890 --> 17:54.550]  So maybe I failed successfully.
[17:54.550 --> 17:55.550]  Just a heads up.
[17:55.550 --> 17:57.990]  I'm a big fan of growing cannabis, comedy, and also fish.
[17:57.990 --> 18:00.390]  Bro, did we just become best friends?
[18:00.390 --> 18:01.390]  We should hang out.
[18:01.390 --> 18:05.170]  It says, just wondering if you ever thought about naming your strains after a fish song
[18:05.170 --> 18:06.990]  or fish lyrics.
[18:06.990 --> 18:10.450]  As a fan, purchasing a fish strain would be a must.
[18:10.450 --> 18:11.610]  I have thought about it.
[18:11.610 --> 18:13.450]  There's a concentrate by Green Dot.
[18:13.450 --> 18:16.930]  They call it Reba Jam, which is definitely named after, of course, Reba.
[18:16.930 --> 18:21.050]  If you're a fish fan, it's a good Reba Jam, which bag it, tag it, sell it to the butcher
[18:21.050 --> 18:22.330]  at the store.
[18:22.330 --> 18:23.930]  Can't go wrong with that.
[18:23.930 --> 18:28.410]  It also says, also, is it possible to buy or create and store male pollen?
[18:28.410 --> 18:30.410]  That's a whole totally different question.
[18:30.430 --> 18:32.430]  So let me ramble on about the fish part.
[18:32.430 --> 18:40.830]  I do have a couple of fish strain names in my head, but nothing has been ... Man, if
[18:40.830 --> 18:44.750]  I'm going to name something after the band that changed my life, I know if you're just
[18:44.750 --> 18:48.790]  listening and you don't know what it's like to follow fish around the country and go on
[18:48.790 --> 18:51.750]  tour and see a bunch of shows, that band changed my life.
[18:51.750 --> 18:54.950]  I learned a lot being a fish follower, a fish fan.
[18:54.950 --> 18:58.670]  If I'm going to name something after that band or in honor of that band, it's going
[18:58.670 --> 19:00.850]  to be something amazing.
[19:00.850 --> 19:03.770]  So I haven't found the right one.
[19:03.770 --> 19:06.610]  Maybe soon, because I've got a lot of great testers out there and some new stuff coming
[19:06.610 --> 19:08.610]  up, maybe.
[19:08.610 --> 19:14.450]  If you've got any ideas, like Tila would be cool, there's ... Guy Yudy might be cool.
[19:14.450 --> 19:19.050]  But if you've got ideas of fish strain names, I would love to hear them.
[19:19.050 --> 19:20.050]  Send them to me.
[19:20.050 --> 19:22.250]  Of course, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.250]  Don't be shy.
[19:23.250 --> 19:27.930]  I want to know your fish strain name suggestions.
[19:28.190 --> 19:29.190]  Don't send me fishing stuff.
[19:29.190 --> 19:30.190]  Send me the band fish.
[19:30.190 --> 19:31.190]  It's a big difference.
[19:31.190 --> 19:35.750]  I don't need the fucking ... I don't even know fishing references.
[19:35.750 --> 19:36.750]  No fly fisher, OG.
[19:36.750 --> 19:37.750]  We don't need any of that.
[19:37.750 --> 19:41.590]  No big trout cush, which hey, somebody out there, use that.
[19:41.590 --> 19:46.710]  If you've got a farmy, wildlife type of vibe, a brand, use that, bro.
[19:46.710 --> 19:49.750]  Big trout cush or fucking big mouth OG.
[19:49.750 --> 19:52.110]  Fucking, there you go.
[19:52.110 --> 19:53.110]  Wild river cush.
[19:53.110 --> 19:56.190]  Oh wait, there's already a something Coal Creek cush.
[19:56.190 --> 19:57.470]  I said I wasn't going to ramble.
[19:58.010 --> 20:00.010]  I told you I'd fucking fail on that one.
[20:00.010 --> 20:01.010]  Now to the next part of this one.
[20:01.010 --> 20:04.970]  Is it possible to buy or create and store male pollen?
[20:04.970 --> 20:08.770]  I'm a medical cannabis grower in Massachusetts who loves growing the dank.
[20:08.770 --> 20:12.210]  I'm interested in experimenting with seed making.
[20:12.210 --> 20:13.930]  I love how that evolution happens.
[20:13.930 --> 20:16.950]  People get super passionate growing cannabis and then the next thing you know, they're
[20:16.950 --> 20:18.170]  making seeds.
[20:18.170 --> 20:20.250]  I'm not discrediting you or doubting you.
[20:20.250 --> 20:21.250]  I love that passion.
[20:21.250 --> 20:23.410]  I love when people do that.
[20:23.410 --> 20:26.450]  Then it says, a little bit nervous about keeping a male in the house.
[20:26.470 --> 20:30.950]  Just wondering if it's possible to buy or make and store male pollen for later use.
[20:30.950 --> 20:32.530]  Feel free to use my name.
[20:32.530 --> 20:34.230]  Say my name, say my name.
[20:34.230 --> 20:37.950]  Big up to our friend Adam and my Instagram, which is youenjoymydank.
[20:37.950 --> 20:40.350]  Bro, I've seen your Instagram around.
[20:40.350 --> 20:45.070]  Thank you for following and supporting iReed Genetics and the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[20:45.070 --> 20:47.230]  Let's talk briefly about male pollen.
[20:47.230 --> 20:49.950]  Yes, you can buy male pollen.
[20:49.950 --> 20:54.150]  Man, I'm not a fan of buying or selling male pollen.
[20:54.170 --> 20:56.770]  I feel like if you're going to breed plants, if you're going to breed cannabis, if you're
[20:56.770 --> 20:59.970]  going to make your own seeds, you've got to do some of the work.
[20:59.970 --> 21:06.350]  Buying pollen is ... I don't want to ... That's just the cheap, lazy way.
[21:06.350 --> 21:07.650]  You didn't do any selection.
[21:07.650 --> 21:09.610]  How do you know that that male is going to be fire?
[21:09.610 --> 21:12.010]  We know that Solomon is fire because I've tested him.
[21:12.010 --> 21:16.290]  If you bought that pollen, which I won't sell, if you bought that, you'd know you've got
[21:16.290 --> 21:17.490]  winning pollen.
[21:17.490 --> 21:21.330]  If you're just buying pollen from somebody on the internet or some dude, you're trusting
[21:21.330 --> 21:23.130]  their selection process.
[21:23.150 --> 21:27.790]  That's like letting them pick your fucking wife or your husband or your mate.
[21:27.790 --> 21:30.190]  I'm not down to let somebody else pick that for me.
[21:30.190 --> 21:33.590]  I'm not in an arranged breeding project.
[21:33.590 --> 21:35.870]  I'm in a selective breeding project.
[21:35.870 --> 21:41.110]  That's why I like to choose ... I choose my male plants, my female plants based on criteria.
[21:41.110 --> 21:42.110]  What is your goal?
[21:42.110 --> 21:45.390]  You don't know what that other grower or breeder or selector, that's all they were.
[21:45.390 --> 21:46.430]  We don't even know about them.
[21:46.430 --> 21:48.130]  They're a selector at this point.
[21:48.130 --> 21:49.310]  We don't know what their goal was.
[21:49.310 --> 21:51.790]  We don't know their education, their knowledge.
[21:51.850 --> 21:53.210]  We have no idea what they chose.
[21:53.210 --> 21:55.410]  Why did they choose that male plant?
[21:55.410 --> 21:57.690]  Their mate may have just been the one.
[21:57.690 --> 21:59.330]  That could have been the one male plant they had.
[21:59.330 --> 22:02.450]  Now they're just using pollen, which that's cool if that's what you're doing, but do you
[22:02.450 --> 22:07.250]  really want to make seeds out of just some male plant or do you want a selected sought
[22:07.250 --> 22:12.370]  after plant with traits and alleles and things that you're after or do you just want ... Do
[22:12.370 --> 22:14.730]  you want the one I picked or the one that you picked?
[22:14.730 --> 22:17.490]  When we go to the restaurant, you want me to order dinner for you or do you want to
[22:17.490 --> 22:19.730]  fuck with the menu and order your dinner?
[22:19.730 --> 22:20.730]  That's how I see it.
[22:20.870 --> 22:22.350]  I don't like buying pollen.
[22:22.350 --> 22:24.070]  I'd rather hunt out my own males.
[22:24.070 --> 22:25.770]  It's not really that much work.
[22:25.770 --> 22:27.190]  Just do it just like you would females.
[22:27.190 --> 22:29.590]  Just find a male and then you've got it.
[22:29.590 --> 22:31.150]  Once you've got the male, you've got it.
[22:31.150 --> 22:32.750]  There is more to it.
[22:32.750 --> 22:33.750]  Storing pollen.
[22:33.750 --> 22:36.750]  Yes, you can run a male plant.
[22:36.750 --> 22:40.630]  You should have ... You're going to finish a seedless crop, right?
[22:40.630 --> 22:44.250]  You should have a male plant in the veg and then right when you finish or right before
[22:44.250 --> 22:48.590]  you finish that crop, put him in there and let him start flowering out.
[22:48.610 --> 22:54.110]  It's as quick as pollen and it's only going to take him 14, 21, 25-ish days to start making
[22:54.110 --> 22:57.230]  plenty of pollen for you to start catching it and playing with it.
[22:57.230 --> 23:01.270]  By day 26, 27, 28, he's really busting a lot of pollen.
[23:01.270 --> 23:04.030]  You can cut him down, gather the pollen and clean up.
[23:04.030 --> 23:07.790]  Then you can just clean up the room and continue back on your normal cycle.
[23:07.790 --> 23:12.630]  You can put yourself behind a couple of weeks to get a male or you can have a male in another
[23:12.630 --> 23:17.070]  location in the same grow space if you are careful and know what you're doing.
[23:17.070 --> 23:21.590]  I've got a grow space where I keep my main breeding area.
[23:21.590 --> 23:25.790]  Inside that breeding area, there's a three-by-three grow tent that ducks.
[23:25.790 --> 23:29.550]  The ducting goes out of the tent and directly out of the house.
[23:29.550 --> 23:34.390]  There's no possibility of that pollen being reintroduced to the main grow space.
[23:34.390 --> 23:36.430]  It goes directly outside.
[23:36.430 --> 23:41.190]  The rest of it is ducted inside that room, but that one tent ducks all the ducting directly
[23:41.190 --> 23:44.430]  outside so it will never make the pollen back into the room.
[23:44.430 --> 23:47.070]  When I start pollinating the boy, he goes in there early.
[23:47.070 --> 23:48.550]  I get him ahead of everybody else.
[23:48.550 --> 23:52.870]  When it's time for him to bust a nut, I just open up that tent, slowly drag him out, sprinkle
[23:52.870 --> 23:54.230]  him all over the plants.
[23:54.230 --> 23:57.310]  If you're careful about it, you can keep a boy in there.
[23:57.310 --> 24:00.750]  Depending on how much pollen you need, how long you keep him around, you only need him
[24:00.750 --> 24:06.750]  in flower for 10, I don't know, more than 10, excuse me, for about 14 to 25, maybe 26,
[24:06.750 --> 24:09.350]  27 days, you can get pollen from him.
[24:09.350 --> 24:13.070]  Depending on how many seeds you want to make, how hard you want to go, you can get pollen.
[24:13.110 --> 24:14.510]  Then you can store it.
[24:14.510 --> 24:16.950]  Let's talk briefly about storing pollen.
[24:16.950 --> 24:18.590]  Before you store it, so collect it somehow.
[24:18.590 --> 24:19.950]  I'm not sure how you're going to collect it.
[24:19.950 --> 24:24.550]  I would say get a Pyrex dish, cut down the top part of the male plant, set it in the
[24:24.550 --> 24:29.390]  Pyrex dish, let it dry, give it a tap, all the pollen will start falling out.
[24:29.390 --> 24:31.070]  Pull out anything that is not pollen.
[24:31.070 --> 24:35.230]  If you've got male flowers in there, leaves in there, buds in there, get all of that shit
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.230]  out.
[24:36.230 --> 24:37.230]  We just want pollen.
[24:37.230 --> 24:38.230]  Let it dry.
[24:38.230 --> 24:39.750]  Put a desiccant pack in there so it will dry.
[24:39.750 --> 24:41.270]  You don't want a Boveda.
[24:41.270 --> 24:43.510]  You want the pack that sucks up all the moisture.
[24:43.510 --> 24:44.510]  Dry that shit out.
[24:44.510 --> 24:45.510]  Get it as dry.
[24:45.510 --> 24:48.250]  I'm going to say dry about 12 or 30 more times.
[24:48.250 --> 24:49.910]  Get it as dry as dry can dry.
[24:49.910 --> 24:51.910]  It needs to be dry.
[24:51.910 --> 24:53.670]  Any moisture in your pollen will destroy it.
[24:53.670 --> 24:54.670]  It will not be active.
[24:54.670 --> 24:55.670]  So get it.
[24:55.670 --> 24:56.670]  What's the word?
[24:56.670 --> 24:57.670]  Dry pollen.
[24:57.670 --> 24:58.670]  Get it dry.
[24:58.670 --> 24:59.670]  Get that pollen dry.
[24:59.670 --> 25:00.670]  Seal it up.
[25:00.670 --> 25:04.710]  Put it in either a glass container, some of those little glass vials, a glass jar, or
[25:04.710 --> 25:09.190]  you can put it in a baggie, label it with the male plant and the date which you collected
[25:09.590 --> 25:11.590]  Then keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[25:11.590 --> 25:15.470]  I put mine in a brown paper bag in the crisper drawer in the fridge.
[25:15.470 --> 25:18.370]  That's simply how I store my pollen.
[25:18.370 --> 25:19.570]  Don't open it too often.
[25:19.570 --> 25:21.030]  Don't take it out of the fridge too much.
[25:21.030 --> 25:22.870]  Think about condensation.
[25:22.870 --> 25:24.090]  Think about temperature changes.
[25:24.090 --> 25:25.710]  Just leave it in there until you need it.
[25:25.710 --> 25:26.710]  Then take it out.
[25:26.710 --> 25:27.710]  Scoop out what you need.
[25:27.710 --> 25:28.870]  Do your pollination.
[25:28.870 --> 25:29.870]  You're safe that way.
[25:29.870 --> 25:30.950]  Be careful with pollination.
[25:30.950 --> 25:33.270]  Turn off all the fans.
[25:33.270 --> 25:36.470]  If you just want to pollinate one or two plants in the room, take them out of the room.
[25:36.470 --> 25:37.710]  Leave the rest in there.
[25:37.710 --> 25:38.710]  Pollinate them.
[25:39.230 --> 25:40.830]  Put them down a couple hours later.
[25:40.830 --> 25:42.230]  Then put them back in the room.
[25:42.230 --> 25:46.390]  Spray the rest of the bitches in there too so no pollen gets contaminated.
[25:46.390 --> 25:49.210]  Water deactivates pollen so that will help you out a lot.
[25:49.210 --> 25:50.950]  The water will destroy the pollen.
[25:50.950 --> 25:56.830]  I think I've answered most of these questions here.
[25:56.830 --> 25:59.190]  Keeping a male, yeah, that's a challenge sometimes.
[25:59.190 --> 26:00.910]  Just make sure you don't pollinate the house.
[26:00.910 --> 26:01.910]  You'll figure it out.
[26:01.910 --> 26:02.910]  You'll figure it out.
[26:02.910 --> 26:03.910]  You'll fuck it up once or twice.
[26:03.910 --> 26:04.910]  Then you'll figure it out.
[26:04.910 --> 26:06.370]  That's all it really takes.
[26:06.370 --> 26:07.370]  You can buy pollen.
[26:07.370 --> 26:08.730]  I don't recommend it.
[26:08.730 --> 26:09.730]  Why not just do the work?
[26:09.730 --> 26:11.010]  Why not get a pack of seeds?
[26:11.010 --> 26:12.010]  You're growing seeds.
[26:12.010 --> 26:13.010]  You're growing plants anyway.
[26:13.010 --> 26:14.010]  Get some seeds.
[26:14.010 --> 26:16.970]  Find a dude that really impresses you and then you've got a male that nobody else has.
[26:16.970 --> 26:19.490]  Why do you want the male plant everybody else has got?
[26:19.490 --> 26:21.930]  That's boring to me.
[26:21.930 --> 26:22.930]  You can store pollen.
[26:22.930 --> 26:24.130]  You can collect it.
[26:24.130 --> 26:25.650]  You can use it later in the future.
[26:25.650 --> 26:28.170]  I think I've answered your question here, my friend Adam.
[26:28.170 --> 26:30.290]  Big up and big thank you for the great question.
[26:30.290 --> 26:32.570]  I look forward to your follow-up.
[26:32.570 --> 26:36.250]  I'm sure you're going to have more to ask after this.
[26:36.250 --> 26:40.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[26:40.050 --> 26:43.810]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you sexy cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[26:43.810 --> 26:47.090]  thank you once again for supporting the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[26:59.130 --> 27:00.130]  I am not afraid.
[27:00.130 --> 27:02.290]  I'm not shy to hear what you've got to say.
