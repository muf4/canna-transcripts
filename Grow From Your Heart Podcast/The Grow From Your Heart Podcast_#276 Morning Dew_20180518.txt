[00:16.120 --> 00:18.340]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:18.340 --> 00:21.900]  It's time for episode number 276 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:22.300 --> 00:26.180]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:26.180 --> 00:28.100]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.120 --> 00:30.220]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.540 --> 00:33.580]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[00:33.580 --> 00:37.260]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.060 --> 00:39.900]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.940 --> 00:42.540]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:42.580 --> 00:45.660]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:45.660 --> 00:48.980]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:49.820 --> 00:52.220]  and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:54.420 --> 00:57.980]  Thanks again for joining me. Everybody is a frosty cold night here in Pueblo,
[00:57.980 --> 01:02.620]  Colorado. I hope you are nice and warm or maybe nice and chill wherever you are.
[01:02.620 --> 01:04.620]  What time of year it is, wherever you are, wherever you're listening.
[01:04.940 --> 01:08.220]  Hope you're having a great time. I also hope you got a big fat dab lined up.
[01:08.220 --> 01:11.140]  I hope you got a big fat joint rolled up. Hope you got the bong loaded.
[01:11.140 --> 01:12.100]  Hope you got a blunt rolled up.
[01:12.100 --> 01:14.980]  You got something going on so you can get medicated with me on the podcast.
[01:16.460 --> 01:19.340]  I like to start the show off by telling everybody what I've been smoking on.
[01:19.380 --> 01:21.460]  Let me reach over here and turn down this music just a little bit more.
[01:21.460 --> 01:22.660]  What am I smoking on today?
[01:22.660 --> 01:26.980]  I have been smoking on some Clementine live resin batter and I've been taking
[01:26.980 --> 01:28.260]  the dads of Clementine.
[01:28.260 --> 01:32.140]  I get it on the dabber and I've got this Gotham high cannabinoid full spectrum
[01:32.140 --> 01:36.180]  extract. It's the crystals, the diamonds. It's hard to stick that to the dabber.
[01:36.500 --> 01:41.500]  So I just push a little to the side and then I stick the Clementine dab dab on
[01:42.620 --> 01:43.060]  the dabber.
[01:43.060 --> 01:46.260]  And then I dip that like a paintbrush into the crystals and just pick up enough
[01:46.620 --> 01:49.300]  kind of like just to season a little, a little bit there.
[01:49.740 --> 01:53.740]  And then the Gotham crystals of course tested at 96 or 98% THC.
[01:53.740 --> 01:57.620]  I'm pretty sure it's 96% THC. So the Clementine gives you a great flavor.
[01:57.620 --> 02:01.260]  It's a nice head buzz. It doesn't do a lot for me to get me high,
[02:01.260 --> 02:03.420]  but the flavor is great. But those Gotham crystals,
[02:03.980 --> 02:07.500]  they really put you in another place. So the Clementine makes it taste amazing.
[02:07.500 --> 02:10.380]  The Gotham gets me super high, really great combo.
[02:10.660 --> 02:12.740]  Obviously it's got me in a good mood. It's got me chatty.
[02:12.940 --> 02:17.300]  So hopefully it's good podcast dabs. Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[02:17.300 --> 02:20.620]  I hope you're as lit up as I am. Something I want to talk about.
[02:21.180 --> 02:25.540]  I've been trying to be a cheap ass. I've been trying to buy cheap hash.
[02:26.020 --> 02:28.660]  Usually the hash that I smoke and I'm not trying to brag or anything.
[02:28.660 --> 02:30.700]  I'm just telling you something that I realized lately,
[02:30.980 --> 02:33.460]  the hash that I smoke from most of the time,
[02:33.460 --> 02:36.180]  the live resins and the batters, depending on where you go,
[02:36.260 --> 02:38.660]  some places have sales, some places have specials.
[02:39.020 --> 02:42.900]  It's going to run you somewhere between usually 35 and 50,
[02:42.900 --> 02:46.420]  maybe $60 a gram for top shelf, super quality hash,
[02:46.900 --> 02:51.180]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts. If you go to some places,
[02:51.180 --> 02:54.820]  it'll be a $40 a gram, maybe $35 a gram.
[02:54.820 --> 02:57.100]  Sometimes you can find it on sale for a little bit cheaper,
[02:57.100 --> 03:00.420]  but not much cheaper. If you're on the recreational side,
[03:00.420 --> 03:03.620]  it's going to be harder to find. And it's probably going to be 50 or $60,
[03:03.620 --> 03:07.060]  maybe 70 or $80 a gram. I don't shop on the recreational side.
[03:07.060 --> 03:08.540]  I've got a medical marijuana card,
[03:09.180 --> 03:11.340]  but I know it's way more expensive on that side of the store.
[03:12.460 --> 03:15.820]  What I'm getting at is, um, I was trying to be a cheap ass.
[03:16.220 --> 03:19.060]  I've been smoking too much of this expensive hash. I thought,
[03:19.340 --> 03:22.380]  what if I go to a dispensary and I buy some of this cheap hash,
[03:22.380 --> 03:23.140]  they're advertising.
[03:23.140 --> 03:27.980]  There was a shop advertising 10 and $15 grams of shatter and $15 grams of live
[03:27.980 --> 03:30.100]  resin. And so I was like, I should go check this out.
[03:30.300 --> 03:32.740]  And I'm not going to say any strain names. I'm not going to say any brand names.
[03:32.740 --> 03:34.140]  I'm not going to say any dispensary names,
[03:34.140 --> 03:36.820]  but I did a little bit of shopping just to see if there was anything out there
[03:36.820 --> 03:38.020]  that was affordable, uh,
[03:38.300 --> 03:41.020]  so that I didn't have to keep buying these 40 and 50 hour grams and dabbing them
[03:41.020 --> 03:42.540]  all day. I was like, I'm just going to go get some cheap shit.
[03:42.540 --> 03:45.300]  That way you can take some big old fat dabs and just keep moving. Uh,
[03:45.500 --> 03:46.780]  cause there's something about a big dab.
[03:47.180 --> 03:50.780]  I could take a hundred little dabs and not get as much effect as I would offer
[03:50.780 --> 03:54.820]  from one big dab. So I like a big dab, just something about the head rush,
[03:54.820 --> 03:56.620]  the lung expansion. I enjoy that.
[03:56.980 --> 03:58.820]  So I like to be able to take a big dab occasionally.
[03:59.300 --> 04:01.420]  So I wanted to go find some cheap shit. I was being a cheap ass.
[04:01.820 --> 04:05.340]  I found some $10 grams. They're acceptable for $10 grams.
[04:05.380 --> 04:09.300]  I would have been mad if it was a 15 or $20 gram. I found some $15 grams.
[04:09.660 --> 04:12.980]  They're exactly what you would expect from a $15 gram. It,
[04:13.100 --> 04:14.940]  I can tell it was made from trim.
[04:15.500 --> 04:18.860]  I can tell that the material was kind of dry and old because it tastes like
[04:18.860 --> 04:23.180]  Keith and it smells like dusty Keith. Both of these cheap grams,
[04:23.260 --> 04:24.100]  they get me high,
[04:24.100 --> 04:26.940]  but I got to smoke a lot of it to get any effect from it,
[04:26.940 --> 04:31.740]  like a quarter or a half of the gram. So I guess it was cost effective.
[04:31.780 --> 04:36.340]  But my complaint is that all of this cheap hash kind of tastes like shit.
[04:36.780 --> 04:41.780]  I would rather pay the extra funds and not have to make this face after I take
[04:42.740 --> 04:44.260]  my medicine and smoke my dab.
[04:45.180 --> 04:47.460]  It's supposed to be enjoyable when I take a fat dab,
[04:47.460 --> 04:51.420]  it's not supposed to taste like pesticides or nutrients or funk or mold or
[04:51.420 --> 04:55.060]  shit. It should be, Ooh, that was orangey and delicious. Or Ooh,
[04:55.060 --> 04:58.020]  that was lemony or Ooh, that tastes like OG kush.
[04:58.540 --> 05:02.260]  But a lot of these cheap dabs, they kind of just tastes like boo-boo.
[05:02.260 --> 05:07.100]  And it's because my theory is that it's because everybody's making high
[05:07.100 --> 05:10.780]  cannabinoid, full spectrum extracts, live resins, batters, butters,
[05:11.180 --> 05:13.260]  all these other fancy hashes.
[05:13.500 --> 05:17.100]  And the shatter is made from the lowest cheapest quality trim in most
[05:17.100 --> 05:20.700]  situations. I can't speak for every place. I know that at the grow I run,
[05:21.220 --> 05:24.020]  we sent, we are very picky about the trim that we send out to her.
[05:24.020 --> 05:28.380]  Actually an extraction company sent us an email saying that they get more
[05:28.380 --> 05:32.140]  returns and highest tests off of our hash material because we pick through it
[05:32.140 --> 05:35.780]  and clean out the shit leaves. And we, it is trim. We make hash out of the trim.
[05:35.780 --> 05:39.340]  There's a lot of popcorn, but in there that gives it better quality. Uh,
[05:39.340 --> 05:40.820]  and we don't spray with any funky shit.
[05:40.820 --> 05:45.180]  We're mostly switching all the way over to a predator bug.
[05:45.180 --> 05:47.580]  So there's no spray on our plants now. It's all predators.
[05:47.580 --> 05:49.620]  So the plants don't taste like shit. Nothing's funky.
[05:49.900 --> 05:53.220]  But some of these other places I'm shopping, some of the other extractions,
[05:53.660 --> 05:55.700]  it's, it tastes terrible. Something's funky.
[05:55.980 --> 05:58.700]  I think they're using the bottom quality shit.
[05:58.700 --> 06:01.060]  I think they're probably using problematic buds.
[06:01.340 --> 06:04.620]  A joke that I used to make when a hash started getting real popular again,
[06:04.620 --> 06:07.580]  like BHO. My joke was now that we know how to make BHO,
[06:07.580 --> 06:09.180]  nobody gets powdery mildew anymore.
[06:09.420 --> 06:12.780]  So I think a lot of the powdery mildew buds that people grow in Colorado,
[06:12.780 --> 06:14.700]  cause we have huge battery mildew problems in Colorado.
[06:14.700 --> 06:18.220]  It's hard to control the indoor environment when the outdoor environment changes
[06:18.300 --> 06:22.100]  30 degrees from day to day. Uh, it was eight o'clock or it was eight degrees.
[06:22.100 --> 06:25.340]  When I got to work at eight o'clock today and it was 32 degrees when I went to
[06:25.340 --> 06:28.900]  lunch at noon. And now it's probably back down. Uh, it's dark time.
[06:28.900 --> 06:32.740]  It's nighttime. It's probably back down to like the 16, 15 degree area.
[06:33.060 --> 06:35.780]  So you have to adjust your HVAC. You have to get shit dialed in.
[06:35.780 --> 06:39.140]  You get humidity that does create a lot of powdery mildew.
[06:39.140 --> 06:42.180]  So I'm sure that a lot of the products that I bought for cheap were powdery
[06:42.180 --> 06:45.860]  mildew or some side of some sort of pesticide ridden, uh,
[06:45.900 --> 06:50.580]  buds that people just had to get rid of on the cheap. What I'm getting at,
[06:50.780 --> 06:52.380]  and I know I've just been ranting for a long time and you're like,
[06:52.380 --> 06:53.660]  what the fuck's your point here? Uh,
[06:53.660 --> 06:57.460]  my point is remember back in the day when you had the choice of buying what they
[06:57.460 --> 07:00.900]  called swag weed or commercial weed, or you could buy,
[07:00.940 --> 07:02.900]  people called it kind bud or there were different words,
[07:02.920 --> 07:05.100]  but there was shit weed and good weed.
[07:05.980 --> 07:07.700]  I was always the guy trying to convince my friends,
[07:07.700 --> 07:09.340]  quit buying that shit weed and buy the good weed.
[07:09.740 --> 07:12.700]  My theory is that if I took a gram of,
[07:12.740 --> 07:14.500]  and I'm just going to be hypothetical with numbers here.
[07:14.500 --> 07:19.180]  If I took a gram of $15 hash and I took a gram of $45 hash,
[07:19.500 --> 07:23.740]  I think the $45 gram lasts me three times as long and gets me three times as
[07:23.740 --> 07:26.980]  medicated and is, doesn't it taste three times better?
[07:27.820 --> 07:30.700]  So I feel like I learned my lesson. I tried, I spent a few bucks.
[07:30.940 --> 07:32.820]  I didn't waste it because I got some medicine,
[07:32.840 --> 07:34.820]  but you should have seen the face I made. Uh,
[07:34.820 --> 07:37.900]  after I took a couple of these dads, one of them tastes like fish oil.
[07:38.580 --> 07:41.540]  One of them kind of tastes like broccoli or Brussels sprouts or something.
[07:41.740 --> 07:43.140]  But I think I learned my lesson, uh,
[07:43.180 --> 07:46.500]  quit trying to be a cheap ass and quit buying the cheapest concentrates I can buy
[07:46.500 --> 07:49.060]  and stick with what I know and what I trust. Uh,
[07:49.100 --> 07:52.300]  but something else that I was going to mention is it seems like shatter is being
[07:52.300 --> 07:56.380]  pushed out of the market so that they can make space for all of the fancy,
[07:56.980 --> 08:00.260]  the acronym concentrates, the high cannabinoid, full spectrum extracts,
[08:00.260 --> 08:04.140]  the high terpene full step spectrum extracts, the batters, the butters. Uh,
[08:04.140 --> 08:06.020]  and of course some places are carrying Rosins,
[08:06.300 --> 08:09.740]  but I see shatter kind of becoming a kind of the old school stuff.
[08:09.740 --> 08:12.660]  Like how a lot of us look at the bubble hash and stuff like that.
[08:12.660 --> 08:15.100]  Like the old hash at the old guy smoke. We look at it like that's hash,
[08:15.100 --> 08:16.660]  old guy smoke pretty soon.
[08:16.660 --> 08:19.620]  That's what shatter is going to be. And I'm going to be an old guy smoking shatter.
[08:20.660 --> 08:23.340]  It's really interesting to me the way things come and go from this industry.
[08:23.340 --> 08:25.540]  So quickly now, uh, before it was legal,
[08:26.180 --> 08:29.980]  it took a long time for things to evolve and travel around the world and around
[08:29.980 --> 08:33.780]  the country. If you were doing, if you're doing dabs in California,
[08:34.020 --> 08:35.900]  before the internet, before legalization,
[08:36.140 --> 08:39.100]  it would have taken years for people in New York to catch on how to do dabs.
[08:39.100 --> 08:42.860]  The same now with legalization in places. Now with the internet,
[08:43.420 --> 08:46.540]  you could do a dab in California on Facebook live and teach your buddy in New
[08:46.740 --> 08:50.100]  York exactly how to do a dab. And you guys can teach each other the same lingo.
[08:50.100 --> 08:53.100]  And now you're seeing the same shit on both coasts, both doing dabs.
[08:53.340 --> 08:56.060]  All this new shit is just across the country instantly.
[08:57.140 --> 09:00.740]  And now with legalization, we're able to do so much more learning,
[09:00.740 --> 09:03.380]  so much more testing, so much more R and D.
[09:03.700 --> 09:06.700]  And we have R and D ourselves up to the top with these crystals,
[09:06.700 --> 09:10.460]  with all these batters and butters to where we have R and D ourselves so
[09:10.460 --> 09:15.820]  quickly that shatter is becoming an antiquity. I think it was 2010,
[09:15.820 --> 09:19.940]  2011, maybe 2009 when I took my first dab,
[09:20.540 --> 09:23.540]  that was my first dab out of a rig. And I'll tell you where that was in a second.
[09:23.540 --> 09:27.900]  But the first time anybody gave me any BHO was a friend of mine just gave me a
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.700]  little piece of parchment with some stuff folded in it and a little sappy stuff
[09:31.700 --> 09:33.900]  folded up in there. And he's like, give that a hit when you get home.
[09:34.300 --> 09:36.980]  And so I went home and I scraped it into a brand new pipe that had never been
[09:36.980 --> 09:37.580]  smoked out of.
[09:37.580 --> 09:41.060]  And I just put it on the bowl and I just lit that shit up and gave it a hit.
[09:41.340 --> 09:44.220]  And I was supposed to go somewhere and wherever I was supposed to go.
[09:44.260 --> 09:45.460]  I remember just texting them.
[09:45.660 --> 09:49.100]  I'm going to be late because I just laid face down on the couch and I was like,
[09:49.100 --> 09:52.140]  Holy shit, I was so high. I hadn't been that high,
[09:52.380 --> 09:55.820]  that instantly high that fast. Cause I went from, I haven't smoked all day.
[09:55.820 --> 09:57.420]  I want to get high to, Oh shit,
[09:57.420 --> 10:02.100]  I need a nap and some food and maybe some cartoons like just instantly.
[10:02.820 --> 10:05.260]  So that was my first time smoking concentrates. And that was,
[10:05.860 --> 10:09.860]  I'm going to say that was not smoking concentrate, smoking BHO made concentrates.
[10:10.140 --> 10:14.580]  I'm going to say that was 2008 or 2009 because of the person that gave it to me
[10:14.580 --> 10:16.820]  and where I was and how we were associated.
[10:17.540 --> 10:20.500]  I was involved with Metamar the dispensary at that time.
[10:20.500 --> 10:23.580]  And that's where I met the guy. And I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.
[10:23.860 --> 10:28.420]  So it was like 2008, 2009 is probably when I started smoking BHO.
[10:28.940 --> 10:31.380]  And then I told you, I would tell you about my first real dab.
[10:31.380 --> 10:34.540]  I've talked about it on this podcast. I was at the,
[10:35.060 --> 10:38.020]  um, the Denver medical,
[10:38.420 --> 10:42.540]  the Denver high times medical cannabis cup at the Xdo event center.
[10:42.660 --> 10:45.500]  There's a lot of words in that title. Cause they had to put medical in there,
[10:46.340 --> 10:49.340]  uh, at the cannabis cup, the high times cannabis cup in Denver at the Xdo.
[10:50.140 --> 10:55.140]  And the Broadway wellness booth had a booth set up and they were giving out
[10:55.140 --> 10:57.220]  dabs and Daniel Desai,
[10:57.220 --> 11:00.980]  also known as big D from top shelf extracts was giving out dabs.
[11:00.980 --> 11:02.300]  And I had talked to him online.
[11:02.300 --> 11:05.260]  We had, uh, corresponded through Facebook a few times.
[11:05.260 --> 11:08.980]  We never met in person and we saw each other's faces. And I was like, dude,
[11:08.980 --> 11:10.340]  you're the guy from the internet. And he's like, dude,
[11:10.340 --> 11:11.180]  you're the guy from the internet.
[11:11.580 --> 11:14.580]  So I walked up and got in line and took a dab and we introduced each other.
[11:14.580 --> 11:16.780]  And then I bought a dab rig from Dan that day.
[11:16.780 --> 11:18.860]  It was actually one of the old school swing arm skillets,
[11:19.340 --> 11:22.020]  but I stood in line and I went up and I got my turn. I took a dab.
[11:22.020 --> 11:24.380]  And I was like, man, that was amazing. And he's like, it's this kind of oil.
[11:24.380 --> 11:26.580]  And he told me, I don't remember what he said, but I was like,
[11:26.580 --> 11:28.700]  I'm going to come back and buy one of those. And he kind of looked at me like,
[11:28.700 --> 11:30.860]  yep, I bet you will. Cause you look like you really like that.
[11:31.380 --> 11:33.700]  And so I thought about it for the next couple of hours. I was like,
[11:33.700 --> 11:35.060]  should I do it? Should I do it? And I was like, fuck,
[11:35.060 --> 11:36.180]  I can't even quit thinking about it.
[11:36.180 --> 11:38.140]  And I went and bought my first dab rig and I still have it.
[11:38.460 --> 11:41.140]  I still have the skillet and I still have the little dub. Uh,
[11:41.140 --> 11:44.820]  they call it a coughless bong. It's just a real, it's a beaker style bong.
[11:45.300 --> 11:48.380]  It's got a little beaker base and it's just real tall and skinny.
[11:48.660 --> 11:50.420]  It doesn't make you cough. It's pretty nice.
[11:50.660 --> 11:55.660]  Then I brought that home and I smoked dabs with a little Kev and pops and Tony
[11:55.860 --> 11:59.620]  and probably Mike and myself. And I don't remember who else was there,
[12:00.140 --> 12:01.700]  but I remember we all took our first,
[12:01.780 --> 12:04.980]  I they took their first dabs in my basement, uh,
[12:05.020 --> 12:08.140]  doing it that 70s show style down in the basement, getting stoned back then.
[12:08.940 --> 12:13.180]  And I think everybody went home and took a nap. I think I called everybody.
[12:13.420 --> 12:15.860]  I texted everybody like four hours later. I was like, what's up?
[12:15.900 --> 12:17.940]  And they're all like, I just fucking woke up from a nap, dude.
[12:18.340 --> 12:19.660]  That shit was funny. I remember that.
[12:19.660 --> 12:23.460]  That was like 2010 or 2011 when that first, uh,
[12:23.460 --> 12:25.220]  high times cannabis cup came to Colorado.
[12:25.220 --> 12:27.940]  I believe the medical one that wasn't recreational is before we allowed
[12:27.940 --> 12:31.580]  recreational cannabis. So that's the amount of time it's now 2000,
[12:31.580 --> 12:36.580]  barely 2018 dabs lasted shatter lasted like eight years before it started
[12:37.260 --> 12:40.660]  becoming the old school shit. It was all the rage for a minute.
[12:41.140 --> 12:44.380]  And now it's like the, yeah, maybe we'll smoke some shatter if he got some,
[12:44.380 --> 12:47.980]  but I'd rather smoke all this other shit first. It's really neat how it's evolving.
[12:48.020 --> 12:50.460]  I've predicted, and I don't know how long this will be.
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.940]  I don't know that we'll actually see this,
[12:52.220 --> 12:56.700]  but I think that eventually you'll be able to go, uh, to,
[12:56.740 --> 13:00.700]  maybe it'll be like a bud tender slash pharmacist slash Coke dispenser machine.
[13:01.220 --> 13:05.820]  And you'll be like, Oh, I like, uh, I like this much THC, this much CBD,
[13:05.820 --> 13:09.740]  this much CBG, this much CBN for my cannabinoid ratios.
[13:09.980 --> 13:13.340]  Now for my terpenes, I like this much terpenolene, this much pineal,
[13:13.620 --> 13:15.940]  this much, whichever terp I'm going to talk about.
[13:16.620 --> 13:19.980]  And then your bud tender or your pharmacist or the machine that you're pressing
[13:19.980 --> 13:21.700]  the buttons on and ordering everything from,
[13:21.700 --> 13:24.140]  because it's the future and everything will be automated. Uh,
[13:24.180 --> 13:28.100]  you just type in your, your ratios. And it basically has a bunch of,
[13:28.100 --> 13:30.660]  it's got those ingredients in the back and it whips them up for you.
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.260]  And it spits it out like a Coke machine. And it's like,
[13:33.260 --> 13:35.380]  here's your grandma concentrate custom tailored for you.
[13:35.780 --> 13:38.220]  It's perfectly mixed up so that every time you take a dab,
[13:38.220 --> 13:43.220]  you get that perfect, this much THC, this much CBD, CBG,
[13:43.420 --> 13:45.500]  CBN, whichever cannabinoids you're looking for.
[13:45.500 --> 13:49.420]  And also the perfect ratio and amount of terpenes to where that it tastes perfect
[13:49.420 --> 13:52.100]  for you. And those terpenoids work with the cannabinoids.
[13:52.140 --> 13:54.460]  It'll be your perfect tailored mix. Uh,
[13:54.500 --> 13:58.820]  maybe it'll you'll have a USB card that you can stick into a machine and it can
[13:59.100 --> 14:02.140]  bring up your options that you've bought before so that you can have your
[14:02.140 --> 14:05.420]  different variety mixes saved on that USB card. So you can just stick USB in.
[14:05.420 --> 14:08.580]  And it goes, Oh, you need mix number 3,752. We'll spit it out for you.
[14:09.460 --> 14:11.580]  And you can just save it on a USB. You've always got your, uh,
[14:11.940 --> 14:15.700]  your mix right there that it, that way it never changes. That's something I,
[14:15.740 --> 14:18.460]  not exactly, but that's sort of what I see coming in the future.
[14:18.460 --> 14:22.020]  You will be able to custom tailor your own concentrate for your own needs.
[14:22.900 --> 14:25.420]  What kind of mix do you think you would make? You should tweet me, uh, tell me,
[14:25.860 --> 14:29.620]  tweet me at GFYH podcast on the Twitter. You can send me a Facebook message,
[14:30.100 --> 14:32.900]  or you can email me it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Let me know.
[14:33.140 --> 14:35.540]  If you can make up your own custom mix, what would you make?
[14:35.540 --> 14:39.220]  Do you know what percentage of which cannabinoid and terpenoid terpenoids you
[14:39.220 --> 14:41.620]  would put in there? Do you know, let me know what you think.
[14:41.900 --> 14:46.660]  I would probably make myself a really high THC mix with a lot of
[14:46.860 --> 14:50.260]  limonene and lemony flavored turps. It'd be terpeneline and limonene.
[14:50.580 --> 14:55.700]  It would be really candy, lemony, uh, lemony flavored, maybe a hint of orange.
[14:55.980 --> 14:58.380]  So maybe like some pineapple in there, oranges, lemons,
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.740]  pineapples would be really like that flavor be super high THC.
[15:01.740 --> 15:05.620]  And it would just make my head spin. And then I would have another one, uh,
[15:05.660 --> 15:10.660]  that had like a real cushy chem flavor and it would have something in there would
[15:11.020 --> 15:13.900]  make me just want to be chilled out, kind of sedated, kind of lazy,
[15:13.940 --> 15:16.060]  maybe kind of creative, maybe a little bit giggly,
[15:16.420 --> 15:19.900]  but I would have two different opposite kinds of ends of the spectrum for my,
[15:19.900 --> 15:23.420]  uh, my custom tailored concentrates. That's what I would do. All right.
[15:23.740 --> 15:26.020]  That's just big hopes and dreams. That's a long time in the future.
[15:26.940 --> 15:29.780]  I hope to see that day and I hope you guys are there with me, man.
[15:29.780 --> 15:33.380]  That was a long, fun rant. These dabs must be working. You guys, uh,
[15:33.420 --> 15:37.180]  let's talk about something more cannabis related. Uh,
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.540]  how about a breeding update? You guys,
[15:38.540 --> 15:40.820]  I keep telling you about the breeding update that I'm working on.
[15:41.140 --> 15:44.900]  I of course in breeding with my male, it's King Solomon. That is an arise male.
[15:44.900 --> 15:46.700]  It's golden go across to daybreaker.
[15:47.460 --> 15:50.980]  I mentioned previously on the show that around Christmas time or around the new
[15:50.980 --> 15:55.100]  year, I would be pollinating and the pollination has happened.
[15:55.100 --> 15:58.900]  Those plants are all filled with pollen. The seeds are forming.
[15:58.980 --> 16:02.980]  The seeds are starting to get hard. I could see them. They're large and green.
[16:02.980 --> 16:05.700]  The calyxes are getting swollen. They're obviously seeded.
[16:05.700 --> 16:08.780]  The pistils have curled up. The plants are bright, bright green,
[16:08.780 --> 16:11.500]  and the pistils are bright red and the trichomes are developing.
[16:11.780 --> 16:15.260]  They look really good. Uh, let me look at the date today.
[16:15.500 --> 16:19.860]  We are recording on, why can't I find the date anywhere? Uh, today is this, uh,
[16:19.860 --> 16:21.620]  the fourth we're recording on January 4th.
[16:21.620 --> 16:25.700]  That means that those plants have been into flower for about 36 days,
[16:25.940 --> 16:29.100]  which means they need about 25 more days ish to finish up.
[16:29.380 --> 16:33.220]  And then those seeds should be ready. They look really nice.
[16:33.220 --> 16:35.140]  I posted one or two pictures to Instagram.
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.220]  So if you're not following me on Instagram, you should check that out.
[16:37.700 --> 16:42.700]  It's IRI, I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S IRI
[16:42.700 --> 16:45.420]  genetics on Instagram. Check out my cannabis photography,
[16:45.740 --> 16:50.140]  but I'm super excited about the Durban poison cross to arise. For some reason,
[16:50.140 --> 16:53.180]  I feel like that's going to be a really good cross.
[16:53.180 --> 16:56.780]  I see a lot of potential in mating those two. Also the star dog.
[16:56.780 --> 17:00.860]  I feel like that's going to be an amazing cross and also platinum tangy is in
[17:00.860 --> 17:01.300]  there.
[17:01.300 --> 17:04.820]  I'm hoping that's just going to make big spears that smell like oranges and
[17:04.820 --> 17:06.940]  candy and are just coated in resin.
[17:06.940 --> 17:09.060]  The platinum tangy is already a great strain.
[17:09.380 --> 17:11.820]  It's just kind of small and I want to make it bigger and I want to make
[17:11.820 --> 17:13.900]  something of my own that has that orange flavor.
[17:14.180 --> 17:16.980]  Want to add that orange to my lineup because I love orange flavored
[17:16.980 --> 17:21.380]  concentrates. So I'm really excited about those three crosses. Uh,
[17:21.420 --> 17:25.060]  they should be finished up here toward the end of January and I'll keep giving
[17:25.080 --> 17:28.900]  you guys updates and I'll keep posting pictures. All right.
[17:28.900 --> 17:30.180]  Speaking of strains that I bred,
[17:30.700 --> 17:34.340]  I've got an email from a listener that starts off by giving me a compliment and
[17:34.340 --> 17:38.740]  then they ask me to give advice on growing strains that I have bred.
[17:38.900 --> 17:41.060]  So I'm going to press pause. I'm going to take a drink.
[17:41.300 --> 17:42.900]  I'm going to take a couple of more dabs.
[17:43.140 --> 17:46.620]  I might check my Instagram and then I'm going to come back and read this email
[17:46.780 --> 17:51.140]  and talk about growing strains that I have bred. I'll be right back.
[17:51.140 --> 17:51.980]  Take a dab you guys.
[17:54.540 --> 17:57.900]  All right. Podcast world. I am back. I am well medicated.
[17:57.900 --> 18:00.380]  I took a dab of some of the cheap hash I was talking about.
[18:00.780 --> 18:02.660]  Kind of tastes like a, I don't know,
[18:02.660 --> 18:06.140]  maybe cream of broccoli soup or maybe some cream corn had sort of a
[18:06.140 --> 18:08.220]  vegetably soft,
[18:08.220 --> 18:12.900]  smooth flavor that I don't approve of. Goddammit. I bought it.
[18:12.940 --> 18:16.820]  Got to dab it. Got to do something with it. Anybody need a dab? I got a dab.
[18:16.860 --> 18:19.460]  If you want to take a dab, there's some stuff. All right,
[18:19.460 --> 18:22.300]  let's get on with the podcast. You guys, I told you I was going to read an email.
[18:22.740 --> 18:25.100]  I printed it out. I've got it right here in my hand. I'm going to read it.
[18:25.460 --> 18:29.020]  It goes like this. It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff. I'm in the Midwest,
[18:29.020 --> 18:32.140]  also known as prohibition land. So you can call me to the roach,
[18:32.140 --> 18:35.740]  which is my dude grows crew name. What up to the roach. Good to meet you.
[18:35.780 --> 18:36.780]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[18:37.620 --> 18:39.740]  Glad to make friends with anybody from the dude grows crew.
[18:40.340 --> 18:41.380]  The email goes on to say,
[18:41.380 --> 18:44.900]  I heard of your show from the guys over at the dude grow show been hooked ever
[18:44.900 --> 18:48.940]  since I've caught up on the majority of your episodes and I love it. Hey man,
[18:48.940 --> 18:51.580]  thanks for listening to the podcast. I'm glad I've got you hooked.
[18:51.940 --> 18:54.460]  And I'm glad you love the show. He also says,
[18:54.460 --> 18:58.100]  I was lucky enough to take advantage of the black Friday sale on your genetics.
[18:58.340 --> 18:59.180]  That's right. You guys,
[18:59.580 --> 19:02.460]  the hell a dank seed bank did a really great black Friday sale.
[19:02.620 --> 19:03.940]  They're doing another sale right now.
[19:03.940 --> 19:07.260]  Making sure you check them out at dank seed dot store.
[19:07.660 --> 19:11.860]  You can grab yourself some iri genetics. He says, I just popped some Prana seeds.
[19:11.860 --> 19:15.780]  I also picked up some morning dew and storm shadow. My question is,
[19:15.780 --> 19:19.940]  have you ever done a show with detailed information or tips on growing said
[19:19.940 --> 19:22.900]  strains? Thank you for your time and for the knowledge and entertainment.
[19:23.940 --> 19:27.420]  I will give my mom a big hug for you and take it to the next level and smoke a
[19:27.460 --> 19:31.420]  fat dab with her. And that sounds good, man. You are going above,
[19:31.620 --> 19:35.940]  above and beyond with that one. Thanks again to the roach. Hey, to the roach,
[19:35.980 --> 19:39.100]  thanks for the great, great email. That's a really good idea.
[19:39.820 --> 19:43.220]  I have actually thought about doing podcasts about strains that I've read,
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.740]  but it felt kind of, I don't know,
[19:44.740 --> 19:46.500]  self-centered or egotistical or something,
[19:46.500 --> 19:49.220]  spending a whole podcast talking about something that I created.
[19:49.740 --> 19:52.900]  But since you asked for it and you actually sent a list of strains that you
[19:52.900 --> 19:54.380]  purchased and wanted tips on,
[19:54.820 --> 19:57.860]  I've decided that I will start doing this and I'll try to get through a few
[19:57.860 --> 20:00.900]  strains over a few episodes. I'll just do one strain per episode,
[20:00.900 --> 20:04.540]  and I'll probably do, I'll space them out pretty far. But I did make a few notes.
[20:05.260 --> 20:07.740]  The strain that I chose to start with is morning dew.
[20:08.060 --> 20:10.140]  I probably would have chosen arise,
[20:10.140 --> 20:13.900]  but since you sent the email that inspired this and you said that you had Prana
[20:13.920 --> 20:15.260]  morning dew and storm shadow,
[20:15.620 --> 20:18.820]  I felt that morning dew would be a good place to start out of those three.
[20:19.140 --> 20:22.740]  And then we will work our way through a lot of the other iRegenetics lineup.
[20:23.580 --> 20:26.980]  The reason I chose morning dew out of those three is because it's got the
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.980]  grateful dog, which was kind of my debut strain.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.100]  That was one of the first strains that I released.
[20:32.120 --> 20:34.980]  I'd made plenty before that, but I never put anything out.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.020]  The grateful dog was the thing that I passed out.
[20:37.020 --> 20:41.620]  I gave a bunch of packs of those away at the cannabis cups in
[20:41.620 --> 20:45.920]  Denver. The first one that was at the the Denver Mart outdoors,
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.620]  I just walked around and gave tons of five packs of seeds away to people.
[20:50.020 --> 20:53.900]  I gave away the heart of gold and I gave away the grateful dog and the grateful
[20:53.900 --> 20:57.100]  dog was a hit. People seem to really love the grateful dog.
[20:57.340 --> 21:00.660]  The genetics of the grateful dog is of course the chem 91,
[21:00.820 --> 21:05.260]  also known as the SBK cut cross to San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[21:05.860 --> 21:07.460]  It's also known as the deadhead OG,
[21:07.460 --> 21:09.740]  but it's a little bit inbred and kind of worked a little bit.
[21:09.740 --> 21:11.420]  So it's the grateful dog fem seed.
[21:11.540 --> 21:16.300]  Cause I put it out in only a feminized version. And that was crossed to the arise,
[21:16.300 --> 21:19.020]  which is golden goat crossed a daybreaker.
[21:19.380 --> 21:21.380]  And I know I'm breaking down the family tree kind of far,
[21:21.380 --> 21:25.140]  but I like to do that because it explains why plants grow the way that they do
[21:25.140 --> 21:28.060]  and what traits you're looking for. Uh, the golden goat of course,
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.140]  his Island sweet skunk, Hawaiian and Romulan.
[21:31.380 --> 21:35.500]  So that's where you get that tropical flavor from that Hawaiian gives it the
[21:35.500 --> 21:39.340]  tropical flavor. The Island sweet skunk of course gives it that sweet tangy thing.
[21:39.340 --> 21:41.420]  And then the Romulan is what makes it grow so well.
[21:41.420 --> 21:44.780]  I think the combination of those made a really great combo.
[21:45.100 --> 21:48.180]  The Hawaiian probably gives it the sativa punch that it's got.
[21:48.660 --> 21:50.620]  I think that golden goat is a great strain.
[21:50.620 --> 21:54.260]  And then I bred that to the daybreaker. I used to daybreaker male, uh,
[21:54.300 --> 21:58.660]  daybreaker of course is chem D crossed to the Joseph OG.
[21:59.340 --> 22:02.900]  The chem D female was pollinated by a male known as Joseph OG.
[22:02.900 --> 22:05.860]  Joseph OG is an OG Kush male. Uh,
[22:05.900 --> 22:09.340]  that daybreaker cross was made by our friends gauge green genetics.
[22:09.660 --> 22:10.980]  I got seeds from gauge green.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.380]  I found a marvelous male and female of the daybreaker in there.
[22:14.740 --> 22:17.940]  I made daybreaker F twos. That's where the black cherry chem came from.
[22:18.180 --> 22:20.580]  Quite a few great crosses came out of that batch of breeding,
[22:20.820 --> 22:24.780]  but I made the daybreaker or I made the, uh, the arise there.
[22:25.100 --> 22:27.060]  Then I took the arise male,
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.340]  which is known as King Solomon and I crossed him to my grateful dog.
[22:31.740 --> 22:35.500]  And the progeny of arise crossed the grateful dog was known as morning dew.
[22:35.500 --> 22:40.020]  Of course that's named after a grateful dead song because it's got the arise.
[22:40.040 --> 22:43.220]  So it's the morning I kind of thought of. And then the grateful dog,
[22:43.220 --> 22:47.140]  which is the grateful dead offshoot named after a grateful dead song about
[22:47.140 --> 22:47.980]  morning dew.
[22:48.460 --> 22:51.900]  So I'm fairly proud and was fairly excited of morning dew because of course
[22:52.140 --> 22:56.740]  arises as a strain I created grateful dog was the first strain I created and now
[22:56.740 --> 22:57.740]  they are put together.
[22:57.940 --> 23:01.300]  So it's kind of a timeline put together to show a little bit of progress in my
[23:01.300 --> 23:04.380]  breeding. Uh, and there are two of my best, uh,
[23:04.580 --> 23:06.940]  best known products other than the lemon Jeffrey,
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.780]  the grateful dog and the arise are probably,
[23:08.980 --> 23:11.740]  and the lemon Jeffrey would be the top three most popular strains I've made.
[23:11.940 --> 23:13.260]  So it's fun to have them put together.
[23:13.500 --> 23:16.700]  Now I've told you a lot about how they were bred or why they were bred,
[23:16.700 --> 23:18.460]  how the names came about and what they are.
[23:18.620 --> 23:22.620]  Let's talk a little bit about growing these plants. Uh,
[23:22.620 --> 23:25.220]  what should you expect from morning dew?
[23:25.780 --> 23:29.860]  Now keep in mind that morning dew is an F1 hybrid and there will be phenotypical
[23:29.860 --> 23:32.380]  variation. You will see differences in your plants,
[23:32.620 --> 23:36.340]  but this is basically what I think will work for every phenotype.
[23:36.340 --> 23:40.540]  Although there will be some outliers and also your conditions, your environment,
[23:40.560 --> 23:41.860]  your lights, your nutrients,
[23:42.180 --> 23:45.780]  all of those things will play a part in everything that I'm about to tell you.
[23:46.100 --> 23:47.980]  If you have LEDs or HIDs,
[23:48.420 --> 23:51.220]  it may take you a little bit longer or shorter flowering time.
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.020]  If you're using hydroponics or soilless mixes,
[23:54.140 --> 23:56.060]  it may take you a little longer, a little shorter,
[23:56.260 --> 24:00.020]  but here's a basic guideline and some things that I have found by running a lot
[24:00.040 --> 24:03.780]  of seeds. Here are things that I found you can expect from morning do seeds.
[24:05.020 --> 24:09.460]  Most of them are going to take you about 55 to 65 days of flowering to finish.
[24:10.100 --> 24:12.100]  Usually nine weeks is just about right.
[24:13.100 --> 24:17.300]  Morning dew plants are going to get medium tall and they'll be kind of bushy.
[24:17.300 --> 24:18.060]  If you top it,
[24:18.060 --> 24:21.980]  if you let it grow to about two feet tall and then take out that main node right
[24:21.980 --> 24:24.500]  out of the middle, then it'll start bushing out real nice.
[24:24.620 --> 24:27.140]  I think it'll bush out and get kind of semi medium tall.
[24:27.140 --> 24:31.060]  It'll get a lot of heads that way that will really increase your production.
[24:31.060 --> 24:31.900]  When you do that,
[24:32.180 --> 24:35.460]  it's going to need some supports right before you put it into flower.
[24:35.460 --> 24:38.860]  Don't put the supports on too early. Leave the tomato cage off,
[24:38.880 --> 24:41.820]  leave the sticks off, leave the cage off, leave the netting off.
[24:42.220 --> 24:45.220]  So that you can put some fans on it and let these plants blow around.
[24:45.540 --> 24:48.540]  Also go in there and super crop stuff so that it gets a little bit stronger.
[24:48.540 --> 24:51.220]  Give it the pop and twist. I talked about that on another episode.
[24:51.740 --> 24:54.660]  When you pop it or you grab it and then you give it a little twist right above
[24:54.660 --> 24:57.900]  your finger, pop and it goes pop, makes a little stronger. Do that.
[24:57.940 --> 25:01.200]  It will like that, but do that stuff before you put supports on.
[25:01.200 --> 25:04.340]  And then right before you flower it, go ahead and put your support.
[25:04.420 --> 25:07.100]  If it's trellising, if it's a tomato cage, if it sticks,
[25:07.900 --> 25:09.060]  it'll need that in flower,
[25:09.060 --> 25:11.660]  but don't do it too early because you don't want to make it weak.
[25:11.980 --> 25:15.300]  A morning dew is going to produce buds that its own branches can't support.
[25:15.300 --> 25:17.740]  It'll need some sort of supports if you do it right.
[25:18.100 --> 25:21.980]  So it's going to be medium tall. It's going to need some supports.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.780]  I would top it and get it kind of bushy. Um, let's see,
[25:26.780 --> 25:29.060]  I'm trying to figure out which order we should go in.
[25:29.300 --> 25:31.260]  It's going to need some cages or some nets or sticks.
[25:31.260 --> 25:34.540]  I think I've talked about that. So now let's talk about,
[25:34.860 --> 25:39.260]  it's going to be stinky. You guys, this one is going to be stinky.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.340]  You're going to need some carbon filtration or something. Uh,
[25:42.380 --> 25:45.260]  if you're going to grow this in an apartment or a house next door to somebody
[25:45.280 --> 25:47.980]  else or in an illegal state, if you're going to grow morning,
[25:47.980 --> 25:53.180]  do I highly suggest plenty of carbon filtration? Uh, maybe, uh,
[25:53.220 --> 25:55.300]  something else around the house that smells good.
[25:55.300 --> 25:58.300]  Also the distracts from the smell it's going to stink.
[25:58.700 --> 26:02.460]  Also if you want to increase that stank ass aroma in the morning,
[26:02.460 --> 26:06.940]  do feed it some kelp type products. It really likes liquid karma.
[26:07.220 --> 26:10.220]  That's one thing I've noticed. It really enjoys liquid karma.
[26:10.500 --> 26:14.860]  It likes a veg bloom products. It likes shine very well. So feed it, uh,
[26:14.900 --> 26:15.860]  kelp products.
[26:16.540 --> 26:20.700]  It also seems to like the pH semi low in late flower.
[26:21.020 --> 26:24.220]  I've noticed that it kinda, it goes a little better. It goes faster.
[26:24.220 --> 26:28.180]  It keeps growing. If later in flower, like around when it starts purple and out,
[26:28.180 --> 26:30.940]  you'll see the morning dew will start to purple out and change colors on you.
[26:31.220 --> 26:34.380]  Maybe lower the pH just a little bit. If you're going six, four or six,
[26:34.380 --> 26:36.820]  five already, maybe try six, three or six,
[26:36.820 --> 26:39.580]  two just go one or two points lower than you normally would.
[26:39.820 --> 26:43.580]  And I've noticed that the morning do tends to like the lower pH.
[26:44.060 --> 26:48.020]  Another thing I've learned about the morning do is that it can use a little more
[26:48.020 --> 26:52.500]  cow mag than most of your plants. I wouldn't do, I wouldn't increase the dosage.
[26:52.500 --> 26:55.100]  I would increase the frequency. I would just feed.
[26:55.100 --> 26:58.100]  If you're doing cow mag once a week, I would maybe do cow mag twice a week,
[26:58.100 --> 26:59.740]  maybe add some Epsom salts in there.
[27:00.220 --> 27:04.700]  But be careful with the nutrients because you don't want to go too hard.
[27:04.700 --> 27:07.300]  You don't want to push it. This is an OG Kush kind of a plant.
[27:07.540 --> 27:11.660]  Going too hard with the nutrients could cause you problems. Don't over water,
[27:12.020 --> 27:16.060]  but make sure you have plenty of water. I think Jorge taught,
[27:16.100 --> 27:20.100]  Jorge Cervantes taught us we want water to be abundant, but not excessive.
[27:20.500 --> 27:22.860]  So if you've got like a three gallon pot,
[27:23.140 --> 27:26.940]  probably pour about half of a gallon on the top of there and let it saturate
[27:26.940 --> 27:29.860]  through. That's probably going to take, depending on the size of your plant,
[27:30.100 --> 27:34.060]  a day, maybe two or three days for that water to dry up and need water again.
[27:34.380 --> 27:38.700]  Let it get fairly dry before you water it again. These plants will enjoy that.
[27:38.900 --> 27:42.540]  The morning do, the grateful dog likes a little bit of a dry period.
[27:43.540 --> 27:46.340]  Cooler temps will help you bring out the purple.
[27:46.340 --> 27:48.780]  I said that these plants change colors later in flower.
[27:49.460 --> 27:51.540]  Some of them will turn really cool purples.
[27:51.820 --> 27:55.380]  Lower temps will certainly help with that. That helps with most plants.
[27:55.580 --> 27:58.580]  And the thing I said about the cow mag, about it wanting a little extra cow mag,
[27:58.780 --> 28:02.780]  most of your OG style plants are going to want a little more cow mag.
[28:03.060 --> 28:05.740]  It's going to give your leaves a really sweet serrated look.
[28:05.740 --> 28:08.380]  They're going to stand up strong. They're going to enjoy it.
[28:08.580 --> 28:12.940]  So cooler temps add some cow mag. Unfortunately, you guys, the morning do,
[28:13.260 --> 28:16.500]  there are some freak ass mutant phenotypes in there. They're rare.
[28:16.820 --> 28:20.420]  I've ran a lot of these seeds and I only came across a few mutants.
[28:20.660 --> 28:22.420]  There was one mutant that was fucking cool.
[28:22.420 --> 28:26.540]  It looked like I had topped it and they grew four equal tops right away.
[28:26.940 --> 28:28.860]  I didn't finish it because I didn't have room for that mutant.
[28:28.860 --> 28:31.340]  I did not want to see what it did. I couldn't waste space on it.
[28:31.340 --> 28:34.140]  It got big enough to see that it was a freak.
[28:34.380 --> 28:36.900]  No one had to get thrown away. It got cold, but I saw that.
[28:36.940 --> 28:39.980]  There were a couple of other odd, odd leaf shaped plants in there,
[28:40.420 --> 28:41.700]  but I finished a lot of those.
[28:41.740 --> 28:46.340]  And I found that the fatter leaf phenotypes of morning do
[28:46.740 --> 28:50.180]  have the stank. If you've got one with the broader, the leaf,
[28:50.180 --> 28:52.340]  the more the stank, it seemed like. And if the ones that,
[28:52.380 --> 28:55.420]  the ones that got black when they started finishing the ones that turned real
[28:55.420 --> 28:58.860]  dark in the leaves, almost a black color, those had the stank,
[28:59.300 --> 29:03.740]  kind of like an OG Kush dirty feet, sort of make your nose crinkle up,
[29:03.740 --> 29:05.220]  but in a good way sort of stink.
[29:05.900 --> 29:09.340]  But those were also the slower grower phenotypes. They were lankier.
[29:09.340 --> 29:12.460]  They grew a little bit slower, but they had the stink.
[29:12.540 --> 29:13.940]  They didn't produce as much herb.
[29:14.220 --> 29:18.500]  They produced a further spaced golf balls instead of spears.
[29:19.460 --> 29:22.300]  But it was such good quality herb that it was worth it.
[29:22.620 --> 29:26.260]  So the fat leaf one is going to be a smaller producing, slower growing plant,
[29:26.460 --> 29:28.220]  but it's going to put out the stank.
[29:28.260 --> 29:30.940]  If you just want some weed that you can smell six blocks away,
[29:30.940 --> 29:33.620]  when you light a joint, that's the phenotype you're looking for.
[29:33.980 --> 29:37.380]  There is a skinnier leaf phenotype. It's got fairly skinny leaves.
[29:37.740 --> 29:40.740]  I'm not sure if those skinny leaves are coming from the golden goat or the chem
[29:40.740 --> 29:43.260]  91, but they're skinny leaves. And you'll see it.
[29:43.260 --> 29:44.620]  If you get the skinny leaf when you'll go,
[29:44.620 --> 29:47.540]  I think that's what he's talking about. It gets kind of tall,
[29:47.900 --> 29:52.500]  but it makes just long skinny buds and it's just coated in resin.
[29:52.500 --> 29:54.580]  And it's got the, it's got the stink to it,
[29:54.580 --> 29:56.820]  but not the stink like the other phenotypes do.
[29:57.140 --> 30:00.500]  It's got more like the chem with some sweet going on is what I noticed.
[30:00.500 --> 30:02.900]  It was like chem, but it had the golden goat background. It was like,
[30:03.300 --> 30:07.380]  if you put a golden goat in a jar that had chem dog in it before,
[30:07.940 --> 30:12.220]  but it had more, it seemed to be more of the THC dominant planet,
[30:12.220 --> 30:15.340]  had more trichomes. It had a better, just a head ripping high.
[30:15.700 --> 30:17.860]  The fatter leafed one was kind of, it got you high,
[30:17.860 --> 30:20.980]  but it was more like in the face, more like in the eyeballs. Uh,
[30:21.020 --> 30:24.580]  but the skinny leaf one, it just made my brain spin around. It had,
[30:24.620 --> 30:27.140]  feels like it's got more, more of a THC punch.
[30:27.140 --> 30:29.860]  So those are two different phenotypes you can look for. Uh,
[30:29.860 --> 30:33.100]  I said earlier to top them when you taught morning do,
[30:33.100 --> 30:34.500]  or if you trellis morning, do out,
[30:34.500 --> 30:38.300]  give her plenty of time to recover because she's kind of a slower growing plant
[30:38.540 --> 30:41.100]  and you don't want to top a plant and then put her right into flower.
[30:41.100 --> 30:44.660]  So if you do topper, give her plenty of time to recover from that.
[30:44.860 --> 30:46.700]  Let those hormones move back up to the tops.
[30:46.700 --> 30:49.460]  Let the hormones decide where they're going to be before you flower.
[30:49.460 --> 30:52.020]  I say 10 days. Some people say a week is enough.
[30:52.020 --> 30:54.060]  I would go 10 to 14 days if it were up to me,
[30:54.620 --> 30:57.180]  just let your top plant recover before you put it into flower.
[30:57.180 --> 30:59.540]  And that's a good idea with any strain, but the morning do,
[30:59.780 --> 31:01.860]  sometimes you've got a slower growing phenotype.
[31:01.860 --> 31:03.620]  So make sure you give it plenty of time to recover,
[31:03.900 --> 31:05.660]  let it stretch back out before you flower it.
[31:05.900 --> 31:08.540]  Or you'll just end up with a bunch of little tiny buds at the top.
[31:08.540 --> 31:10.460]  And that's no fun. You want to call up there at the top.
[31:10.460 --> 31:13.180]  You want to take a good picture and brag on Instagram. So top them,
[31:13.180 --> 31:17.020]  let them recover, put some cages or some nets or some sticks on them.
[31:17.220 --> 31:19.140]  It can take some bending. It can take some trousers.
[31:19.900 --> 31:23.620]  Morning dew is also very powdery mildew resistant. We have learned,
[31:23.940 --> 31:27.060]  we had some plants outdoors, not myself, but a friend had some plants outdoors.
[31:27.100 --> 31:31.300]  All of them, except the morning do got powdery mildew on them over the last
[31:31.300 --> 31:33.180]  outdoor harvest. So that's something that you can,
[31:33.660 --> 31:36.260]  you can think about if you're going to grow outdoors and you get powdery mildew,
[31:36.260 --> 31:38.740]  maybe the morning do is one that will do well for you.
[31:38.820 --> 31:40.620]  It won't get the powdery mildew.
[31:41.140 --> 31:45.340]  It's definitely one of the faster finishers and it's one of my most like chem
[31:45.340 --> 31:49.260]  dog, chemi sort of scented strains that I've made available.
[31:49.260 --> 31:52.300]  So if you're into something that's got that chem sort of funk to it,
[31:52.820 --> 31:56.860]  it's kind of got some like dirty feet and sort of chemi and it smells
[31:56.860 --> 32:00.900]  disgustingly delicious. And I love it. It's pungent. It's definitely funky.
[32:01.580 --> 32:05.300]  There's hints of gas in there. There's fuel, there's funk, there's OG kush,
[32:05.340 --> 32:08.700]  there's chem dog. And then sometimes because of the golden goat,
[32:08.700 --> 32:12.780]  you end up with these like real sweet tropical tones that mix in with that.
[32:12.780 --> 32:14.300]  There's some great phenotypes in there.
[32:14.540 --> 32:19.140]  So that's a quick breakdown of morning do man to the roach.
[32:19.340 --> 32:22.620]  That was a really good email, a really good question. I appreciate it.
[32:22.900 --> 32:25.020]  I feel like that was a lot of fun.
[32:25.020 --> 32:28.380]  I haven't had the opportunity to talk about a strain I've bred.
[32:28.780 --> 32:32.060]  It's something I'm proud of. It's something I've got passion about.
[32:32.060 --> 32:33.700]  So that was honestly a lot of fun.
[32:34.020 --> 32:36.940]  I plan on doing more episodes about more strains.
[32:36.940 --> 32:40.380]  I'll probably do the three you asked about first and then we'll branch off to
[32:40.380 --> 32:44.260]  other stuff. But dude, I appreciate that. Thank you to the roach.
[32:44.460 --> 32:45.940]  I look forward to your next email.
[32:46.620 --> 32:49.300]  And if anybody else out there has a question or something they'd like to say,
[32:49.300 --> 32:51.220]  I would love to hear from you. You can reach out to me.
[32:51.220 --> 32:53.980]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[32:54.140 --> 32:57.500]  Maybe I will read your email on a future episode.
[32:57.700 --> 33:01.660]  I really do enjoy doing the listener generated content. All right.
[33:01.660 --> 33:05.140]  And also don't forget that the morning do seeds are available at dankseed.store.
[33:07.620 --> 33:08.580]  All right. Podcast world.
[33:08.580 --> 33:10.140]  This is the part where I thank you for listening.
[33:10.140 --> 33:12.340]  And then I ask you to follow me on social media.
[33:12.340 --> 33:15.100]  I would appreciate it if you follow me on Facebook and Twitter,
[33:15.180 --> 33:17.900]  just search for the grow from your heart podcast on Facebook, on Twitter,
[33:17.900 --> 33:21.940]  it's at GFYH podcast on Instagram. I use my other company.
[33:22.140 --> 33:26.620]  I use I read genetics on Instagram. I R I E underscore genetics.
[33:26.620 --> 33:30.860]  I read genetics on Instagram. I'm probably at 16,000 followers by now.
[33:30.860 --> 33:35.220]  I post a lot of great cannabis photography. If you're listening to this podcast,
[33:35.420 --> 33:37.660]  I bet you will like my Instagram feed.
[33:37.860 --> 33:39.980]  If you want to reach out to me and you're not into the social media,
[33:39.980 --> 33:43.340]  of course you can email me once again, that is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[33:45.300 --> 33:47.100]  Don't forget that I've got a YouTube channel.
[33:47.300 --> 33:51.820]  There are about 140 old episodes up on YouTube. I am making more.
[33:51.820 --> 33:54.580]  I keep telling you guys that they're coming. If you're paying attention,
[33:54.580 --> 33:56.860]  I'm sure you can see that they're slowly trickling up there.
[33:57.140 --> 33:59.500]  I just ties up my computer and it takes a long time to make those.
[33:59.500 --> 34:02.260]  It takes a lot of bandwidth to upload them. So they're going up slowly,
[34:02.260 --> 34:05.180]  but they will all get there. Eventually I'll get caught up to 275.
[34:05.220 --> 34:07.900]  I'll get caught up to 276 episodes on YouTube.
[34:08.580 --> 34:10.180]  Also don't forget about Patreon.
[34:10.220 --> 34:14.420]  Patreon is a way for podcast listeners to support podcast content providers.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.620]  If you'd like to learn more on how to support this podcast,
[34:17.820 --> 34:21.580]  I invite you to go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[34:21.820 --> 34:24.660]  All the information that you need to sign up will be right there.
[34:24.860 --> 34:28.460]  The trend seems to be that most people have been contributing $4 and 20 cents
[34:28.460 --> 34:29.020]  per month.
[34:29.020 --> 34:33.980]  I recently learned that there was a cannabis advocate who has a podcast or a
[34:34.180 --> 34:39.020]  show and they encouraged their listeners to go find another cannabis advocate
[34:39.020 --> 34:43.660]  or podcast or show that supported the legalization of cannabis and contribute
[34:43.660 --> 34:47.300]  $4 and 20 cents to that show. And it seems like a few people listened.
[34:47.300 --> 34:49.500]  So thank you guys. I appreciate that.
[34:49.700 --> 34:52.780]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[34:53.380 --> 34:56.700]  I think I mentioned it on the last episode, but through Patreon contributions,
[34:56.700 --> 35:01.100]  I was able to cover the cost of my website this year. My website,
[35:01.100 --> 35:04.420]  I read genetics, colorado.com is where I host the podcast.
[35:04.420 --> 35:07.740]  It's then uploaded through an RSS feed to iTunes and Stitcher and all the other
[35:07.740 --> 35:10.900]  podcast services that you hear it on. And without that website,
[35:11.140 --> 35:14.060]  I would not be able to host the podcast for free.
[35:14.660 --> 35:19.100]  So I owe a huge thank you to everybody who contributed to Patreon last year and
[35:19.100 --> 35:22.220]  everyone who is continuing to contribute to Patreon this year.
[35:22.500 --> 35:27.460]  Thanks to all the past, present, and future contributors to my Patreon campaign.
[35:27.700 --> 35:28.540]  I appreciate it.
[35:28.700 --> 35:32.100]  And I'm sure everybody else listening to the podcast appreciates it also because
[35:32.380 --> 35:35.900]  you're making it free for everybody else. And I appreciate it. And you guys,
[35:36.060 --> 35:39.420]  if you can't contribute, don't feel bad. There are people who can contribute.
[35:39.620 --> 35:42.820]  I want this podcast to be free, but there are people who feel like they can help
[35:42.820 --> 35:46.220]  out. So say thank you to them. Thank you guys. We appreciate you.
[35:46.500 --> 35:50.460]  I appreciate you. The listeners that can't contribute. They appreciate you also.
[35:50.740 --> 35:53.380]  Big, huge. Thanks. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[35:53.660 --> 35:56.660]  you can tell that my throat starting to burn out. It's time for another dab.
[35:56.780 --> 35:58.500]  I think I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[35:58.700 --> 36:01.860]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Brett C and until next time,
[36:01.860 --> 36:04.340]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
