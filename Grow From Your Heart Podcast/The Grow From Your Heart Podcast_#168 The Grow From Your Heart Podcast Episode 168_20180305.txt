[00:01.020 --> 00:12.370]  It's time for episode number 168 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:12.370 --> 00:18.240]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:18.240 --> 00:21.240]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:21.240 --> 00:24.240]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:24.240 --> 00:27.240]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:27.240 --> 00:30.240]  this, my friend, is the podcast for you.
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.240]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:33.240 --> 00:35.240]  I want to thank you guys for tuning in.
[00:35.240 --> 00:37.240]  I'm Rasta Jeff. I'm a cannabis activist.
[00:37.240 --> 00:39.240]  I'm a cannabis smoker. I'm a cannabis addict.
[00:39.240 --> 00:41.240]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.240 --> 00:43.240]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.240 --> 00:46.240]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.240 --> 00:48.240]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.240]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.240 --> 00:55.240]  I hope everybody's having a great day while they're listening.
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.240]  I did not put out a Thursday episode. I apologize, guys. It was Thanksgiving.
[00:59.240 --> 01:01.240]  I wanted to kind of hang out for a week.
[01:01.240 --> 01:03.240]  I'm actually recording the day after Thanksgiving.
[01:03.240 --> 01:04.240]  Hope everybody had a good holiday.
[01:04.240 --> 01:07.240]  Hope everybody survived Black Friday.
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.240]  Maybe you boycotted Black Friday. Whatever you did, I hope it went well for you.
[01:10.240 --> 01:11.240]  Hey, guys, I'm hanging out.
[01:11.240 --> 01:21.240]  Just about 45 minutes ago, I ate a Schumett banana pudding bar made with 200 mg of THC distillate.
[01:21.240 --> 01:24.240]  It says, caution, contains medical marijuana for medical use only.
[01:24.240 --> 01:26.240]  Keep out of reach of children.
[01:26.240 --> 01:28.240]  I could see why, you guys.
[01:28.240 --> 01:30.240]  About 40 minutes ago, my life was different.
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.240]  I'm getting high as shit from this thing.
[01:32.240 --> 01:35.240]  Decided I better get down on this recording and get it done before things get wonky in my world.
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.240]  So big shout out to our friends at Schumett Bars.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.240]  I endorse the banana pudding bar. It's delicious.
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.240]  Go get yourself one. Check it out at your local dispensary.
[01:43.240 --> 01:46.240]  All right, you guys. Speaking of shout outs, big shout out to our friends at thedankteam.com.
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.240]  If you need regular or feminized seats, make sure you support our friends at thedankteam.com.
[01:51.240 --> 01:54.240]  Let me try that again. Thedankteam.com. There we go.
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.240]  That was English.
[01:55.240 --> 01:58.240]  Thedankteam.com. They've got brands like Archive Seed Bank.
[01:58.240 --> 02:00.240]  They have got Mile High, Canaventure.
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.240]  They've, of course, got iRegenetics.
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.240]  They've got Rare Dankness.
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.240]  They've got everybody you can think of.
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.240]  They've now got Brothers Grim Seeds, which is a great thing.
[02:08.240 --> 02:10.240]  Big shout out to Brothers Grim and the C99.
[02:10.240 --> 02:13.240]  So make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[02:13.240 --> 02:15.240]  Let's see. Who else do I need to give a shout out to?
[02:15.240 --> 02:21.240]  No more shout outs. Since we're talking about seeds, let's talk about my recent breeding project, you guys.
[02:21.240 --> 02:23.240]  It has been time.
[02:23.240 --> 02:26.240]  Yesterday, I checked the male plants. I checked the female plants.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.240]  And they were speaking at me, bro.
[02:27.240 --> 02:29.240]  They were like, it is time.
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.240]  Let's sprinkle some pollen.
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.240]  Anybody that has been paying attention to the show knows that I have been running a breeding project continuously.
[02:35.240 --> 02:36.240]  I've always got some breeding going.
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.240]  But right now, I've got a male Arise plant and I've got some female plants.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.240]  What's in there?
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.240]  I have got a Grateful Dog female.
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.240]  There's a Lemon Jeffery female.
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.240]  There are several Cookies and Cream females.
[02:47.240 --> 02:48.240]  What else is in there?
[02:48.240 --> 02:49.240]  There's White Widow.
[02:49.240 --> 02:51.240]  And there are some other things in there.
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.240]  There are also Arises in there, so I can make some Arises have two seeds.
[02:54.240 --> 02:56.240]  There's a bunch of stuff in the room.
[02:56.240 --> 02:59.240]  But yesterday, the male plants are huge.
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.240]  There are male Colas the length of my arms on these male plants.
[03:03.240 --> 03:05.240]  And they are just pollen is just falling out.
[03:05.240 --> 03:07.240]  If you breathe too heavily, pollen goes flying across the room.
[03:07.240 --> 03:11.240]  So, I didn't want to drag the whole plant across the room to where the females were.
[03:11.240 --> 03:19.240]  So, I cut off a few select branches that were quite large, carried them over to the female plants, and gave all those male plants a nice shake.
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.240]  There was a huge cloud of pollen in my grow room for quite a while.
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.240]  I taste like pollen.
[03:24.240 --> 03:26.240]  Everything tastes like pollen around me.
[03:26.240 --> 03:28.240]  My whole mouth was just coated in pollen.
[03:28.240 --> 03:29.240]  I had to take a fat shower.
[03:29.240 --> 03:30.240]  I had to clean everything up.
[03:30.240 --> 03:32.240]  There was a lot of pollen in the air.
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.240]  So, in about 50-60-ish days, we're going to have some new seeds, some new creations.
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.240]  There's going to be some great stuff happening.
[03:38.240 --> 03:40.240]  I'm excited for that.
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.240]  So, let's see.
[03:41.240 --> 03:42.240]  What else can I talk about?
[03:42.240 --> 03:43.240]  We talked about that.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.240]  I'm just making it.
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.240]  I've got a checklist, you guys, because I get stupid high and forget to talk about shit.
[03:46.240 --> 03:48.240]  And then talk about shit that doesn't even matter instead.
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.240]  Let's see.
[03:49.240 --> 03:50.240]  What did I do?
[03:50.240 --> 03:51.240]  I kind of want to brag.
[03:51.240 --> 03:57.240]  A couple of days ago on Friday night, I got to take my lovely date Jenny Beth to Comedy Works to go see a movie.
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.240]  Joe Rogan was the headliner.
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.240]  There was a comedian named Jerron Horton that opened.
[04:01.240 --> 04:03.240]  That dude was fucking hilarious, you guys.
[04:03.240 --> 04:05.240]  I'd never heard of or seen him before.
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.240]  When he came on stage, he walked in, made a presence, and he crushed for like 30 or 40 solid minutes.
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.240]  And then he wound down and he looked at the crowd and he was like, I think I'm done.
[04:13.240 --> 04:15.240]  And he said, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rogan.
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.240]  And Joe Rogan came out and crushed, you guys.
[04:19.240 --> 04:22.240]  Joe Rogan just did his new comedy special for the year.
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.240]  And when a comedian records their special, the way they do it, they kind of record that special
[04:26.240 --> 04:27.240]  and they throw away that material.
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.240]  Once your comedy special comes out on Comedy Central or Netflix or wherever it goes,
[04:31.240 --> 04:33.240]  See-So seems to be the new shit.
[04:33.240 --> 04:36.240]  But once your comedy special comes out, you throw away that material.
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.240]  You don't perform that anymore.
[04:37.240 --> 04:39.240]  And you work on your next hour.
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.240]  And then at the end of the year, you want to put out your whole new special of our material.
[04:43.240 --> 04:45.240]  Then you do that all over again.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.240]  And that keeps the comedian on his toes.
[04:47.240 --> 04:48.240]  But Rogan just put out a special.
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.240]  So he's only had a couple of months to work up new shit, maybe a month.
[04:52.240 --> 04:54.240]  And he was here doing new shit.
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.240]  He went for an hour and a half and about 45 to an hour into the show,
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.240]  he kind of looked up at the crowd with this look and he goes,
[04:59.240 --> 05:01.240]  I just ran out of shit about like three minutes ago.
[05:01.240 --> 05:02.240]  I don't have any more material.
[05:02.240 --> 05:05.240]  And he just started making shit up on the fly and kind of joking.
[05:05.240 --> 05:06.240]  And he still crushed it.
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.240]  He did a little bit of crowd work, but he destroyed for a comedian.
[05:10.240 --> 05:11.240]  I love Joe Rogan's style.
[05:11.240 --> 05:12.240]  I love the way he does comedy.
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.240]  And I agree with like 97% of what he says.
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.240]  So that's always a great show.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.240]  So Joe does his show.
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.240]  He wraps up.
[05:18.240 --> 05:20.240]  We're giving him a standing ovation.
[05:20.240 --> 05:24.240]  He walks off the stage and less than 40 seconds later,
[05:24.240 --> 05:26.240]  he comes running back on stage.
[05:26.240 --> 05:29.240]  It had to be like 15, 20 seconds later, he ran back on stage.
[05:29.240 --> 05:32.240]  And he grabs a microphone and he said, sit the fuck down.
[05:32.240 --> 05:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Chappelle is here.
[05:34.240 --> 05:36.240]  Or he said, you guys, Dave Chappelle is here.
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.240]  And me and my date looked at each other like, what?
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.240]  Because that's what probably one of our favorite comedians, both of us.
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.240]  I've never seen Dave Chappelle.
[05:45.240 --> 05:46.240]  She's never seen Rogan or Chappelle.
[05:46.240 --> 05:49.240]  I've seen Rogan before, but for Chappelle to walk out was awesome.
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.240]  Chappelle was fucked up.
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.240]  You guys, Chappelle was intoxicated.
[05:54.240 --> 05:57.240]  Luckily, since I've got some friends at comedy works,
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.240]  I happen to be front row.
[05:58.240 --> 06:01.240]  And as you walk out onto the stage, there are a couple stages,
[06:01.240 --> 06:03.240]  a couple seats actually on the stage.
[06:03.240 --> 06:05.240]  But then if you go a few more feet,
[06:05.240 --> 06:08.240]  those next two seats that are in the crowd are where I was sitting and
[06:08.240 --> 06:10.240]  where Jenny Beth was sitting.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.240]  So Chappelle just was fucked up.
[06:12.240 --> 06:14.240]  So he just walked out barely onto the stage.
[06:14.240 --> 06:17.240]  So he was on the stage and he stood directly in front of her and I and
[06:17.240 --> 06:21.240]  told jokes for about 30 minutes and chain smoked cigarettes and drank Corona
[06:21.240 --> 06:22.240]  beers.
[06:22.240 --> 06:26.240]  He did 40 solid minutes of grabbing by the pussy jokes and material about
[06:26.240 --> 06:27.240]  Trump and the election.
[06:27.240 --> 06:29.240]  He did some Dave Chappelle jokes.
[06:29.240 --> 06:30.240]  He did a little bit of weed jokes,
[06:30.240 --> 06:34.240]  but mostly grabbing by the pussy jokes for like 40 minutes by Dave Chappelle.
[06:34.240 --> 06:35.240]  It was hilarious.
[06:35.240 --> 06:37.240]  A big shout out to Jenny Beth for going with me.
[06:37.240 --> 06:38.240]  And she was an incredible date.
[06:38.240 --> 06:40.240]  We've been having a lot of fun with her lately.
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.240]  So big shout out.
[06:41.240 --> 06:42.240]  And that was a great time.
[06:42.240 --> 06:43.240]  Glad she was able to come.
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.240]  Had to get her off work a little bit early for that and glad it worked out.
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.240]  Super huge shout out to the fucking traffic.
[06:47.240 --> 06:48.240]  Oh my God.
[06:48.240 --> 06:49.240]  Usually I 25 can lick my balls,
[06:49.240 --> 06:50.240]  but that night it was smooth.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.240]  I can't believe it.
[06:51.240 --> 06:52.240]  That was awesome.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.240]  Everything went super smooth that day.
[06:53.240 --> 06:55.240]  A big shout out to Baker at comedy works.
[06:55.240 --> 06:56.240]  Big shout out to comedy works.
[06:56.240 --> 06:58.240]  Big shots of the entire comedy works crew.
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.240]  Comedy works has a podcast.
[06:59.240 --> 07:00.240]  You guys,
[07:00.240 --> 07:01.240]  it's called how comedy works.
[07:01.240 --> 07:02.240]  If you care about comedy,
[07:02.240 --> 07:03.240]  if you're a comedy fan,
[07:03.240 --> 07:06.240]  I of course am obviously check it out.
[07:06.240 --> 07:08.240]  How comedy works hosted by Wendy,
[07:08.240 --> 07:10.240]  the owner of comedy works and a comedian.
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.240]  His name is Rick Kearns.
[07:12.240 --> 07:14.240]  He's almost famous.
[07:14.240 --> 07:15.240]  You know,
[07:15.240 --> 07:16.240]  he's kind of on the cusp there,
[07:16.240 --> 07:18.240]  but he's really funny and he's got a great personality.
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.240]  So check him out.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.240]  Let's see.
[07:20.240 --> 07:22.240]  Where else are we on this list of things to talk about?
[07:22.240 --> 07:25.240]  I want to give one more shout out and then we're going to do a couple things
[07:25.240 --> 07:26.240]  here with the podcast.
[07:26.240 --> 07:27.240]  I do have some real content.
[07:27.240 --> 07:28.240]  You guys,
[07:28.240 --> 07:31.240]  I always shout out to my friend at the spliff cast.
[07:31.240 --> 07:32.240]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[07:32.240 --> 07:34.240]  there's a podcast called the spliff cast.
[07:34.240 --> 07:35.240]  They gave me,
[07:35.240 --> 07:38.240]  she gave me like a minute and a half shout out and an endorsement the other
[07:38.240 --> 07:39.240]  day.
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.240]  And I listened to her.
[07:40.240 --> 07:41.240]  Somebody told me,
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.240]  Hey,
[07:42.240 --> 07:43.240]  this podcast shouted you out.
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.240]  And wow,
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.240]  that's a great show.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.240]  So check it out.
[07:46.240 --> 07:48.240]  It's hosted by a lady named Bo Nellis.
[07:48.240 --> 07:51.240]  She's not as hyper as me and she doesn't take as many dabs as me.
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.240]  So she's a little,
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.240]  a little more focused.
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.240]  If I'm too much energy for you,
[07:54.240 --> 07:55.240]  if I'm too hyper and spastic,
[07:55.240 --> 07:57.240]  you'll definitely enjoy her.
[07:57.240 --> 07:58.240]  She's calm.
[07:58.240 --> 08:01.240]  She's more mellow than myself and she puts out a great show.
[08:01.240 --> 08:02.240]  So I endorsed that fully.
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.240]  Thanks for the shout out.
[08:03.240 --> 08:04.240]  Thanks for the support.
[08:04.240 --> 08:07.240]  And you guys support my new friend at the spliff cast.
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.240]  All right.
[08:08.240 --> 08:12.240]  I am going to open up iTunes here.
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.240]  I've got a couple of new iTunes comments.
[08:13.240 --> 08:14.240]  You guys,
[08:14.240 --> 08:16.240]  I love the iTunes comments and the reviews.
[08:16.240 --> 08:17.240]  I would appreciate it.
[08:17.240 --> 08:18.240]  If you go to iTunes,
[08:18.240 --> 08:19.240]  if you're an iTunes user,
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.240]  if you've got an iPhone,
[08:20.240 --> 08:21.240]  if you've got a Mac book,
[08:21.240 --> 08:22.240]  whatever,
[08:22.240 --> 08:23.240]  however you're using iTunes,
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.240]  a lot of you guys are using an Android with Stitcher,
[08:24.240 --> 08:25.240]  but if you've got iTunes,
[08:25.240 --> 08:26.240]  go to the iTunes store,
[08:26.240 --> 08:28.240]  search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.240]  When you find you got to scroll down to the bottom,
[08:30.240 --> 08:31.240]  there's a little tab with the logo.
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.240]  It's got the red,
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.240]  golden green logo with my face on it.
[08:33.240 --> 08:34.240]  Click on that,
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.240]  go to ratings and reviews.
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.240]  It would be super awesome.
[08:36.240 --> 08:37.240]  If you typed in a rating,
[08:37.240 --> 08:38.240]  a review,
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.240]  and then gave me a rating.
[08:39.240 --> 08:41.240]  Everybody so far has given me a five star review.
[08:41.240 --> 08:43.240]  I've got 39 five star reviews.
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.240]  It'd be cool if you kept that up,
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.240]  but hey,
[08:45.240 --> 08:46.240]  give me what you feel I deserve.
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.240]  That would be awesome.
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.240]  I'm going to read the two most recent comments.
[08:50.240 --> 08:53.240]  This one just happens to be from Bo at the spliff podcast.
[08:53.240 --> 08:54.240]  They said,
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.240]  she said one episode in,
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.240]  and I can tell this show is solid.
[08:58.240 --> 09:01.240]  Can't wait for the new ones and to go digging through old ones.
[09:01.240 --> 09:02.240]  I can't grow,
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.240]  but in theory,
[09:03.240 --> 09:05.240]  and you got all kinds of delivery on the theory.
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.240]  Thanks,
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.240]  man.
[09:07.240 --> 09:08.240]  Well,
[09:08.240 --> 09:10.240]  I appreciate you for listening to the podcast.
[09:10.240 --> 09:12.240]  It's great hearing other podcasts,
[09:12.240 --> 09:15.240]  podcasters compliment your podcast.
[09:15.240 --> 09:16.240]  That really means a lot to me.
[09:16.240 --> 09:18.240]  All the compliments mean a lot to me,
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.240]  but she complimented on her show.
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.240]  She complimented the sound quality other than me clear in my throat.
[09:23.240 --> 09:24.240]  I apologize for that.
[09:24.240 --> 09:26.240]  She complimented the sound quality and that means a lot to me.
[09:26.240 --> 09:27.240]  So thanks for noticing.
[09:27.240 --> 09:28.240]  I appreciate that.
[09:28.240 --> 09:29.240]  And thanks for noticing the show overall.
[09:29.240 --> 09:31.240]  So a big shot at the boat,
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.240]  the spliff podcast.
[09:32.240 --> 09:34.240]  Our next comment comes from dab Smith's dab.
[09:34.240 --> 09:36.240]  Smith's has become a good friend lately.
[09:36.240 --> 09:37.240]  We've been talking a lot.
[09:37.240 --> 09:38.240]  The comment says,
[09:38.240 --> 09:39.240]  I got five star review.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.240]  Also in the comment says,
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.240]  great show is always buddy.
[09:41.240 --> 09:44.240]  You should try to do two shows a week on the reg.
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.240]  Thanks for the good podcast to listen to every Monday morning.
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.240]  When I start the daily grind,
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.240]  I usually get the show while I'm prepping my work for the day.
[09:51.240 --> 09:53.240]  Keep up the good work amigo.
[09:53.240 --> 09:54.240]  You know,
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.240]  I wish I could do.
[09:55.240 --> 09:58.240]  I wish I could promise you two shows every week.
[09:58.240 --> 10:00.240]  Sometimes time doesn't allow it this week.
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.240]  Of course,
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.240]  being the Thanksgiving week,
[10:02.240 --> 10:03.240]  I just took it off.
[10:03.240 --> 10:04.240]  I wanted to hang out,
[10:04.240 --> 10:05.240]  spend some time,
[10:05.240 --> 10:06.240]  actually worked on my garden a little bit.
[10:06.240 --> 10:07.240]  I hung out with that girl,
[10:07.240 --> 10:08.240]  Jenny Beth.
[10:08.240 --> 10:09.240]  I've been talking about so much.
[10:09.240 --> 10:10.240]  I hung out with some family,
[10:10.240 --> 10:11.240]  hung out with my kiddo.
[10:11.240 --> 10:12.240]  Yes,
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.240]  I do have a daughter.
[10:13.240 --> 10:14.240]  I don't talk about her a lot on the podcast because I mean,
[10:14.240 --> 10:15.240]  she doesn't want to be talked about.
[10:15.240 --> 10:16.240]  I'm pretty sure on a podcast,
[10:16.240 --> 10:18.240]  but hung out with her a little bit.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.240]  So it kind of took,
[10:19.240 --> 10:20.240]  took the Thursday episode off.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.240]  I promise you a Monday episode and I will do my best to get you.
[10:24.240 --> 10:26.240]  Thursday episodes as frequently as I can.
[10:26.240 --> 10:28.240]  I appreciate you for listening.
[10:28.240 --> 10:30.240]  I'm glad that I can make your Mondays better.
[10:30.240 --> 10:31.240]  That was why I put them out on Monday.
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.240]  Mondays are generally shitty for people who don't like their jobs or don't
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.240]  have the best jobs.
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.240]  People that don't get to grow weed,
[10:37.240 --> 10:39.240]  people that aren't artists or musicians.
[10:39.240 --> 10:40.240]  Your Monday probably sucks.
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  If you're in the service industry,
[10:41.240 --> 10:42.240]  your Monday sucks.
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.240]  So that's why I put them out on Monday morning.
[10:44.240 --> 10:45.240]  I try to make your day a little bit brighter.
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.240]  I'm glad I'm doing that for you.
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.240]  Dab smits.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.240]  Thanks for listening.
[10:48.240 --> 10:49.240]  Yeah,
[10:49.240 --> 10:50.240]  I appreciate it.
[10:50.240 --> 10:51.240]  You guys,
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.240]  I would love your comments or if you've got something else you'd like to
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.240]  say and you don't want to say it on a public forum,
[10:53.240 --> 10:54.240]  you can send me an email.
[10:54.240 --> 10:56.240]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.240]  I would totally love to hear from you.
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.240]  Speaking of emails,
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.240]  you guys,
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.240]  that's where we're going to get to.
[11:03.240 --> 11:04.240]  Let's get to this email from a guy.
[11:04.240 --> 11:05.240]  Dude,
[11:05.240 --> 11:07.240]  I'm going to hit pause and take a drink so I can quit clearing my throat.
[11:07.240 --> 11:08.240]  Hold on for just a second.
[11:08.240 --> 11:09.240]  You don't even have to hold on.
[11:09.240 --> 11:10.240]  Just keep listening.
[11:10.240 --> 11:11.240]  It'll happen through editing.
[11:11.240 --> 11:12.240]  All right.
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.240]  I feel like that's a little bit better.
[11:15.240 --> 11:17.240]  Of course it'll come back because I took some dabs and I ate this.
[11:17.240 --> 11:19.240]  I'm not blaming it on the banana pudding bar,
[11:19.240 --> 11:21.240]  but it is kind of making my throat a little,
[11:21.240 --> 11:22.240]  it's getting rid of that buttery thing.
[11:22.240 --> 11:23.240]  But anyway,
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.240]  let's get to this email.
[11:25.240 --> 11:27.240]  Let's start it off with an email from a dude who said,
[11:27.240 --> 11:28.240]  call him Roscoe.
[11:28.240 --> 11:29.240]  He says,
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.240]  Hey dude,
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.240]  it's Roscoe.
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.240]  I messaged you for advice,
[11:32.240 --> 11:33.240]  which I got from you,
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.240]  uh,
[11:34.240 --> 11:35.240]  from your episodes and it was great stuff.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.240]  Dude,
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.240]  keep up the good work.
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.240]  I catch up every Monday at work on your podcast and have done so for over a year now when I came across it.
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.240]  In fact,
[11:42.240 --> 11:43.240]  dude,
[11:43.240 --> 11:46.240]  it was around that time you said he'd put money in a pot for your curse words.
[11:46.240 --> 11:47.240]  So you guys a long time ago,
[11:47.240 --> 11:48.240]  uh,
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.240]  I didn't find it very professional to use any profanity on my podcast.
[11:51.240 --> 11:53.240]  And when I would drop F bombs and other words,
[11:53.240 --> 11:55.240]  I would try to throw,
[11:55.240 --> 11:58.240]  I forgot how much money I said I would put in a jar and we actually donated that to a good cause,
[11:58.240 --> 12:00.240]  but I filled up a jar with a bunch of money,
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.240]  you guys.
[12:01.240 --> 12:02.240]  And then somebody was like,
[12:02.240 --> 12:03.240]  that's stupid.
[12:03.240 --> 12:04.240]  Be yourself.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.240]  I hate it when you try to restrain yourself.
[12:05.240 --> 12:06.240]  And so I decided you're right,
[12:06.240 --> 12:07.240]  fuck it.
[12:07.240 --> 12:08.240]  And now I say fuck on the show because it's a lot more,
[12:08.240 --> 12:09.240]  it's more me.
[12:09.240 --> 12:10.240]  Honestly,
[12:10.240 --> 12:11.240]  it's more comfortable and I hate trying to censor myself.
[12:11.240 --> 12:12.240]  It's how I,
[12:12.240 --> 12:13.240]  I don't know.
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.240]  Maybe it's not professional,
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.240]  but that's how I roll.
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.240]  And it's me.
[12:16.240 --> 12:17.240]  I'd rather be me than not to tell you the truth.
[12:17.240 --> 12:20.240]  So he's continues to say anyway,
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.240]  safe to say due to your podcast and the educated guests you have on,
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.240]  I have successfully grown a lot of nice bushy plants.
[12:27.240 --> 12:28.240]  Awesome.
[12:28.240 --> 12:29.240]  I'm glad to hear that.
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.240]  He also says I've saved a ton of money.
[12:31.240 --> 12:32.240]  Thanks to you guys.
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.240]  Thanks to you guys.
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.240]  Seriously,
[12:34.240 --> 12:37.240]  not buying from the local riff raff has been a weight lifted off of me.
[12:37.240 --> 12:38.240]  Anyway,
[12:38.240 --> 12:40.240]  I've been thinking for a year now about doing a podcast,
[12:40.240 --> 12:41.240]  much similar to yours,
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.240]  bar a few things.
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.240]  Uh,
[12:44.240 --> 12:45.240]  that's,
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.240]  I've got to back up.
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.240]  That's something I don't think about.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.240]  He says that I've saved him money and a big hassle,
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.240]  not having to buy from the local riff raff.
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.240]  Uh,
[12:53.240 --> 12:54.240]  I'm six foot five and 200 pounds.
[12:54.240 --> 12:57.240]  And I don't worry a lot when I used to have to go buy cannabis,
[12:57.240 --> 13:01.240]  but I can only imagine if I were not this stature and I didn't have this,
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.240]  uh,
[13:02.240 --> 13:04.240]  type of upbringing where I'm from and I had to go,
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.240]  uh,
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.240]  into my old neighborhood where I'm actually from to go buy weed.
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.240]  I can just imagine how that would feel to be some of those people in the
[13:10.240 --> 13:12.240]  stress that that would be.
[13:12.240 --> 13:14.240]  I'm sure people get robbed and beat up and shit and get sold terrible
[13:14.240 --> 13:16.240]  product that isn't even weed.
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.240]  And that's got to suck.
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.240]  So I'm sure I could lift a lot of weight off people's shoulders if they're
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.240]  able to grow.
[13:21.240 --> 13:22.240]  That is,
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.240]  I can only imagine that I didn't even realize that just thinking about the,
[13:24.240 --> 13:26.240]  the people you can avoid by not having to buy herb,
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.240]  that's helpful.
[13:27.240 --> 13:28.240]  Anyway,
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.240]  he goes on,
[13:29.240 --> 13:30.240]  I am rambling today.
[13:30.240 --> 13:31.240]  You guys,
[13:31.240 --> 13:32.240]  I apologize.
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.240]  I'm going to blame it on the 200 milligram Schumet bar that I ate.
[13:33.240 --> 13:34.240]  And the,
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.240]  uh,
[13:35.240 --> 13:36.240]  what is this?
[13:36.240 --> 13:37.240]  How many ounces of this is like 16 ounces of Dr.
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.240]  Pepper together.
[13:38.240 --> 13:39.240]  Woo.
[13:39.240 --> 13:40.240]  That's a combo.
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.240]  You guys,
[13:41.240 --> 13:42.240]  I'd be feeling it.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.240]  He says,
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.240]  uh,
[13:44.240 --> 13:45.240]  I've been thinking about doing a four.
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.240]  I've been thinking for over a year now about doing a podcast,
[13:47.240 --> 13:48.240]  much similar to you,
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.240]  similar to yours bar,
[13:49.240 --> 13:50.240]  a few things.
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.240]  Then he says,
[13:51.240 --> 13:53.240]  I am in the UK and there's not really a podcast out here for the UK.
[13:54.240 --> 13:55.240]  People.
[13:55.240 --> 13:57.240]  And you have inspired me to want to be that podcast.
[13:57.240 --> 13:59.240]  The law is changing slowly here.
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.240]  The NHS are testing it for the first time now.
[14:01.240 --> 14:04.240]  And all the MPs want to advise our new prime minister,
[14:04.240 --> 14:05.240]  Mr.
[14:05.240 --> 14:07.240]  May to legalize cannabis.
[14:07.240 --> 14:08.240]  Oh,
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.240]  that's awesome.
[14:09.240 --> 14:11.240]  There's a lot of amazing stuff in that one paragraph.
[14:11.240 --> 14:14.240]  I've inspired somebody to want to create a podcast for their,
[14:14.240 --> 14:15.240]  for their,
[14:15.240 --> 14:17.240]  the UK for the entire UK about cannabis,
[14:17.240 --> 14:18.240]  because there isn't one.
[14:18.240 --> 14:19.240]  That's awesome.
[14:19.240 --> 14:20.240]  I am.
[14:20.240 --> 14:22.240]  I'm honored that I inspired somebody to do that.
[14:22.240 --> 14:23.240]  Also.
[14:23.240 --> 14:24.240]  I'm glad that I inspired you to do that.
[14:24.240 --> 14:26.240]  That that's going to lead me to part of my reply to your email.
[14:26.240 --> 14:28.240]  It's also great that the law is slowly changing there.
[14:28.240 --> 14:30.240]  I know some areas in the UK have really strict shitty cannabis laws.
[14:30.240 --> 14:32.240]  I'm glad that they're easing up on that.
[14:32.240 --> 14:34.240]  I love that the MPs want to advise the minister.
[14:34.240 --> 14:35.240]  Uh,
[14:35.240 --> 14:37.240]  that they want them to legalize cannabis.
[14:37.240 --> 14:38.240]  When,
[14:38.240 --> 14:40.240]  when I'm pretty sure that's the military police.
[14:40.240 --> 14:41.240]  I'm not sure exactly.
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.240]  I didn't research that,
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.240]  but whoever,
[14:43.240 --> 14:44.240]  when other,
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.240]  when other,
[14:45.240 --> 14:46.240]  when other people are doing it,
[14:46.240 --> 14:47.240]  I'm glad that they're easing up on that.
[14:47.240 --> 14:48.240]  I'm glad that they're doing it.
[14:48.240 --> 14:49.240]  I'm glad that they're doing that,
[14:49.240 --> 14:50.240]  but whoever,
[14:50.240 --> 14:51.240]  when other,
[14:51.240 --> 14:52.240]  when other people are like,
[14:52.240 --> 14:53.240]  Hey,
[14:53.240 --> 14:54.240]  do this,
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.240]  that that's really helpful.
[14:55.240 --> 14:56.240]  So this guy goes on to say,
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.240]  I want to educate people and teach them how to grow small secret setups
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.240]  and have fun doing it.
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.240]  UK cannabis news,
[14:59.240 --> 15:00.240]  culture,
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.240]  education,
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.240]  chats,
[15:02.240 --> 15:03.240]  and more.
[15:03.240 --> 15:04.240]  Uh,
[15:04.240 --> 15:05.240]  if not illegal to encourage on a podcast.
[15:05.240 --> 15:06.240]  You know,
[15:06.240 --> 15:07.240]  I don't think it's illegal to encourage on a podcast,
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.240]  but where you are,
[15:08.240 --> 15:11.240]  you may want to talk to a lawyer because I don't know the rules in the UK.
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.240]  That could be completely different.
[15:12.240 --> 15:14.240]  I've been told that I'm safe.
[15:14.240 --> 15:17.240]  As long as I'm careful and we try to be careful here on the show.
[15:17.240 --> 15:22.760]  So check on that yourself. That's the best I can say there, but you go on to say could you give me any advice on doing this?
[15:22.760 --> 15:28.880]  Any tips tricks etc to a successful successful podcast, and he said thanks dude much love
[15:29.660 --> 15:34.400]  Roscoe and they also said PS don't mind if you read it on your podcast, which is good because I just read the whole email
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.600]  on the podcast
[15:35.600 --> 15:37.860]  First off. Thank you for the email second
[15:37.860 --> 15:41.880]  I'm glad that I can inspire you to do a podcast about cannabis third
[15:41.880 --> 15:45.560]  Thanks for being so passionate about cannabis because it sounds like it's illegal there
[15:45.560 --> 15:49.440]  And you're risking your life and your safety and your family and your freedom and your finances in your future
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.680]  For this plant because you're in love so thanks for being on this team
[15:52.880 --> 15:55.920]  And that leads me to my answer my part of my reply
[15:55.920 --> 16:03.200]  I know that you're the right person to do this podcast because you have taken the effort to reach out to me to say
[16:03.520 --> 16:05.520]  What should I do so that tells me right there?
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.080]  You are supposed to be the guy doing this podcast be the confident dude that you are
[16:10.680 --> 16:12.680]  When you go to make your podcast
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.920]  Talk to the people just like you did to me in this email because this is comfortable
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.480]  And it sounds like you're a cool person, and it sounds like you can connect with people so do that on your podcast
[16:20.480 --> 16:26.240]  Just be yourself. That's the best advice. I can give to any person trying to do any podcast be you
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.160]  If you're fake your listeners will know it you won't have any fun
[16:30.160 --> 16:30.880]  It won't feel good
[16:30.880 --> 16:36.680]  And you'll come across fake and people can spot fake and they won't listen to fake and you'll get more shitty emails than you could
[16:36.680 --> 16:38.680]  Imagine so chill out be yourself
[16:40.040 --> 16:45.320]  Edit a little bit, but don't take out all of your mistakes. I I stutter I say dumb shit
[16:45.320 --> 16:47.800]  I say the wrong shit, and I talk over myself all the time
[16:47.800 --> 16:52.920]  But that's me and I've learned to accept me and it makes a good podcast just being me people don't want me to be
[16:53.160 --> 16:54.520]  Apologize. I'm not the president
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.480]  I don't need to come out you at here up here and speak some perfect shit to you teaching how to grow weed so be
[16:59.480 --> 17:01.320]  Yourself be comfortable
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.320]  Get some good equipment. That's something. I really should say you don't need to be a politician
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.960]  You really should say you don't need to spend a lot of money. My favorite setup is the zoom h6 on the go
[17:10.960 --> 17:14.280]  I use a zoom h6 and I run for Sennheiser
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.080]  835 e835 microphones into that. I'm not sure what's available in the UK. You could probably get that or very similar
[17:21.520 --> 17:24.560]  It's a great recording device. A lot of people use that
[17:25.240 --> 17:26.320]  for my big setup
[17:26.320 --> 17:28.240]  there's a lot of stuff happening but
[17:28.240 --> 17:35.000]  Sound quality is certainly important people if when people do phone calls on a podcast or if they Skype in I don't even listen
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.880]  So get good quality, so I'd really stress on good quality sound good
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.400]  Sound the best you can make sure that there's no funky noise in the background or if you're gonna do in a coffee shop
[17:45.400 --> 17:50.200]  And you want that clunky like dishes and waitress sound vibe kind of thing go for that if that's your vibe
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.760]  I don't like that. I like it quiet when I talk there when I don't talk there's no noise in my background
[17:53.760 --> 17:58.140]  I love that sort of feel so sound how you want to sound achieve your sound figure out how you got to do that
[17:58.380 --> 18:00.380]  be yourself and then
[18:01.100 --> 18:04.980]  Find content that relates to the audience you want to hit which is obviously
[18:05.300 --> 18:08.460]  Cannabis and news and culture and education and chats
[18:08.460 --> 18:10.460]  So find some people in your community
[18:10.460 --> 18:15.540]  That you can get on a show and build a relationship with what I found is the people that come back to my show
[18:15.980 --> 18:17.980]  The third and fourth time they come back
[18:17.980 --> 18:23.460]  They forget they're on a podcast and they're now hanging out in my little recording space and we just happen to have headphones and a
[18:23.460 --> 18:28.940]  Microphone on and we really get talking about cannabis in a way that we love instead of a way that feels
[18:29.300 --> 18:34.860]  Podcasty and interviewee like you guys notice when Jesse comes back the first time Jesse was here you guys a hundred episodes
[18:35.100 --> 18:39.200]  Just you talk like this like said like four words like okay
[18:39.220 --> 18:39.720]  Yeah
[18:39.720 --> 18:42.220]  And now when Jesse comes on you can't get him to shut up you guys
[18:42.380 --> 18:46.220]  So just get kind of build a relationship with somebody that you can get on the podcast
[18:46.380 --> 18:52.320]  Try to find people that are experts in certain areas of cannabis like I've got a guy Jesse's my outdoor guy
[18:52.940 --> 18:57.180]  Of course Sean is kind of the organics guy even though he's hard to get a hold of lately
[18:57.700 --> 19:03.380]  Spencer was our extracts guy even though he's moved to try to have guys that you can have like special like you got guys for
[19:03.380 --> 19:06.860]  Everything in your life. You got a you got a weed guy, you know, you got a fireworks guy
[19:06.860 --> 19:11.700]  You got a whatever guy get those guys for your podcast also, so that's something I could recommend
[19:13.700 --> 19:18.020]  Here's something that I could talk about from being a podcast nerd if you want to be noticed in iTunes
[19:18.340 --> 19:23.380]  get at least eight or ten episodes put together before you launch into iTunes because
[19:23.700 --> 19:30.220]  Your first eight weeks in iTunes is when they will notice you and that's if you get good ratings and you pop out with a
[19:30.220 --> 19:35.460]  Lot of quality content iTunes will put you in the new and noteworthy category, which will get you a lot more
[19:36.500 --> 19:42.140]  Views and or listen so try to get eight episodes put together drop a lot of quality content in eight weeks
[19:42.140 --> 19:44.260]  And you'll get up there in iTunes. I
[19:45.140 --> 19:49.520]  Feel like another guy I listen to you guys a lot of what I've learned on podcasting
[19:49.520 --> 19:52.500]  I got to give somebody a shout out here because I feel like I just turned I channeled this guy
[19:52.500 --> 19:53.940]  There's a guy named Cliff Ravenscraft
[19:53.940 --> 19:57.160]  He was known he is known as the podcast answer man
[19:57.160 --> 20:03.020]  If you go to the podcast answer man calm cliff will teach you a lot of stuff about podcasting
[20:03.020 --> 20:07.580]  There's a lot of paid content on his website. He will want you to sign up for his podcasting a to Z courses
[20:07.580 --> 20:09.580]  I'll try to get you to pay for a lot of
[20:09.980 --> 20:13.900]  online courses I have not paid for anything and I have learned a
[20:14.580 --> 20:21.180]  Tremendous amount about podcasting just through Cliff Ravenscraft's free stuff through his Twitter feeds through his email groups just stuff like that
[20:21.180 --> 20:28.100]  So you can always contact Cliff Ravenscraft or podcast answer man calm. That is a wealth of podcasting knowledge
[20:28.620 --> 20:34.540]  All right. So Roscoe, I feel like I have given you a lot of podcasting information and this is a cannabis podcast
[20:34.540 --> 20:41.780]  So I am going to try to wrangle my listeners back up and I'm going to read an email about cannabis next Roscoe
[20:41.780 --> 20:43.220]  I truly appreciate your efforts
[20:43.220 --> 20:49.340]  I want to know how your podcast goes if you do get this podcast launched or if you need any help getting this podcast
[20:49.340 --> 20:53.660]  Launched send me another email. I would be truly delighted to help you get your podcast going
[20:53.660 --> 20:55.460]  I'll give you all the advice I can
[20:55.460 --> 20:59.140]  Things are gonna be a little bit different because you're in the UK some of the setup may be different
[20:59.140 --> 21:03.140]  But we'll get it going. We'll figure it out between the two of us. We're smart enough to get this going
[21:03.140 --> 21:06.740]  I can't wait to hear your show and also thanks for listening and thanks for the email
[21:06.740 --> 21:09.340]  I look forward to hearing your show in the future
[21:09.460 --> 21:13.780]  Don't put it off because if you keep putting it off, it'll just fall to the wayside and you'll forget get it going
[21:14.020 --> 21:17.940]  All right, you guys I need to take a quick drink and I'm gonna read another email about cannabis
[21:18.180 --> 21:21.020]  All right, you guys I got a quick drink. I took a fat dab now
[21:21.020 --> 21:24.820]  I'm ready to read another email. This one comes from you know, I don't know if he wants me to say his name
[21:24.820 --> 21:28.980]  Let's see. I'm looking I don't have any indicator. So I'm not gonna say your name, dude, but big shout out
[21:28.980 --> 21:33.540]  You know how you are. I appreciate you for sending an email. Now. I will read your message. It goes like this
[21:33.540 --> 21:34.860]  It says hey, bro
[21:34.860 --> 21:37.460]  Loving the show been listening for over a year now first
[21:37.460 --> 21:41.060]  I want to thank you for spreading the knowledge and being a voice for the cannabis community
[21:41.620 --> 21:46.300]  Awesome, man. First off. Thanks for listening second. I guess I'm glad to be that voice for the community
[21:46.300 --> 21:49.220]  I guess I'm just the guy that grabbed a mic and wanted to do that
[21:49.220 --> 21:52.780]  I never thought of that trying to think about it then her put too much pressure on me
[21:52.780 --> 21:54.900]  Anyway, he goes on and he says my question
[21:54.900 --> 21:58.620]  I hope you can give your thoughts on is a term known as bud washing
[21:58.620 --> 22:02.100]  I had a good friend telling me to try it in case you're unfamiliar with the term
[22:02.100 --> 22:08.060]  It's where you take your just harvested buds that are still on the branches and you dip or wash them in water
[22:08.060 --> 22:13.860]  I read it's supposed to get dust particles off of your herb and make it cleaner tastier smoke
[22:14.340 --> 22:17.060]  Then he also says thanks for turning me on to Richie spice
[22:17.060 --> 22:21.780]  I heard you mentioning him on a previous episode. So I searched him out and then he quotes him Richie spice
[22:21.780 --> 22:25.140]  I'm and you're glad. All right, you're welcome. I'm glad you like Richie spice
[22:25.140 --> 22:27.740]  So you guys I'm high as shit tonight. This Schumet bar is kicking in
[22:27.740 --> 22:30.500]  I ate this an hour and a half ish ago and
[22:31.100 --> 22:34.860]  Yeah, I'm floating around on my chair here 200 milligrams of THC distillate will get to you
[22:34.860 --> 22:38.700]  Let's have had a few dabs. So kind of floating around. I like it. I love it. Try it
[22:39.220 --> 22:44.740]  So I'm gonna kind of talk about what he asked here he said is bud washing a term that I am familiar with yes
[22:44.740 --> 22:50.780]  I learned this from Jorge Cervantes or hey didn't do it with just water or he took a five gallon bucket of
[22:51.940 --> 22:55.680]  He used reverse osmosis water. You can use water from the hose if your water is
[22:55.680 --> 22:59.040]  Okay, if you don't have funky ass water, you can use water from your hose
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.860]  So fill up a five gallon bucket of water and then Jorge was putting 25
[23:03.220 --> 23:05.220]  I've seen people put more you guys
[23:05.580 --> 23:09.920]  But 25 is probably what I would recommend 25 or 30 milliliters of
[23:11.140 --> 23:14.780]  30% hydrogen peroxide into a 5 gallon bucket of water
[23:15.220 --> 23:19.580]  Not the hydrogen peroxide that your mom's got in the cabinet the stuff that you buy
[23:19.940 --> 23:22.460]  You can get it at the hydro store. Probably you can get it online
[23:23.020 --> 23:28.220]  But it's 30% maybe 33 maybe 35 percent hydrogen peroxide
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.860]  It's not expensive
[23:30.860 --> 23:34.700]  But you put about 30 milliliters of that 25 30 mils in a 5 gallon bucket
[23:35.140 --> 23:36.260]  Stir it up real good
[23:36.260 --> 23:42.020]  and then you harvest the branches and you leave is like kind of long branches, you know, six to eight inch long branches and
[23:42.220 --> 23:44.220]  wear rubber gloves and
[23:44.500 --> 23:48.980]  Dunk the entire branch into the water and give it a swirl like freshly chopped
[23:48.980 --> 23:52.440]  You want to chop the plants down cut off all the big leaves trim it up?
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.540]  Like you're gonna trim it up again later. Like you're just cleaning it up. You're not manicuring it. You're just kind of trimming it
[23:57.980 --> 24:04.100]  Then dunk that into the water solution the peroxide water solution give it a good swirl so that if there is
[24:04.500 --> 24:08.260]  Perhaps powdery mildew on there. You can knock that powdery mildew off
[24:08.260 --> 24:12.380]  That is a really good way to get powdery mildew if you don't have the PM on there
[24:12.380 --> 24:16.700]  I guess that would knock dust off if you grew it outside and it got dusty and shit
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.660]  But I don't see how much it dust is really gonna be on your plants if you grew indoors in a good
[24:20.820 --> 24:26.080]  Grow environment, but I've heard of this being done by Jorge Cervantes and I've seen it done by other people
[24:26.800 --> 24:30.640]  For powdery mildew and other problems like that to clean that stuff off
[24:31.400 --> 24:36.440]  So a little bit of peroxide 25 to 30 mils in a 5 gallon bucket of clean water
[24:36.440 --> 24:39.240]  Cut the branches into 6 or 8 inch maybe 10 inch sections
[24:39.240 --> 24:42.960]  It's got to fit in that 5 gallon bucket. Don't get in there. Give it a good shake then hang it up
[24:43.560 --> 24:48.200]  Give the buds plenty of space when they're hung up when they're that way and they're just gonna drip onto the floor you guys
[24:48.200 --> 24:50.760]  All that water is gonna drip all over the floor
[24:51.240 --> 24:54.880]  And it's just gonna run right out and then it'll dry keep a fan in the room
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.320]  Maybe a dehumidifier on there pay attention to the conditions in your drying area
[24:58.560 --> 25:00.560]  But if you're gonna do this, you got to pay attention
[25:01.360 --> 25:03.240]  Don't let it get to you too humid in there
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.360]  Now a lot of people are gonna say you're gonna soak buds that were just harvested you guys if you think about it
[25:08.360 --> 25:13.420]  Cannabis plants grow outside and if it weren't for us getting in the way, they would get wet all the damn time
[25:13.420 --> 25:17.480]  I don't think that every cannabis plant that ever got wet outside got destroyed
[25:17.480 --> 25:20.300]  I'm pretty sure that a lot of them got stronger and they got tougher
[25:20.720 --> 25:24.600]  If you look at the shape of a cannabis plant, it is kind of shaped like an umbrella
[25:24.880 --> 25:26.880]  When water hits a cannabis plant
[25:27.080 --> 25:32.960]  The leaves push the water in an outward direction and it spreads it out so that it falls down
[25:33.200 --> 25:38.600]  Now that tells me that you should water the plants around that area because that's where the roots are gonna grow out because in nature
[25:38.760 --> 25:40.280]  That's where the water is gonna land
[25:40.280 --> 25:41.600]  Of course, you want to get it in toward the stock
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.620]  But the outward area is a little bit more where you want it because nature would spread it out
[25:45.620 --> 25:48.880]  So cannabis is gonna search for roots out that way because it knows that you guys
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.240]  Also, the resin glands on your plant will protect it from the water
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.320]  You're not gonna bust that off by just giving it a little dunk. It's not gonna come off there these guys that make hash
[25:58.640 --> 26:02.760]  They're using a washing machine and ice to pull those trichomes off of your buds
[26:02.800 --> 26:06.280]  So a little bit of a dunk isn't gonna gonna pull those off of there
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.320]  If you've already got a little bit of PM or if you had an issue, this is a good way to get rid of it
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.720]  It's funny because in Colorado
[26:11.720 --> 26:17.560]  I make the joke that nobody gets powdery mildew anymore ever ever since anybody invented or figured out how to make BHO
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.920]  Everybody just fucking blast it even though it's got powdery mildew on it
[26:20.960 --> 26:27.500]  But I wouldn't recommend using a whole if it's got a lot of powdery mildew don't don't use it get rid of that product get
[26:27.500 --> 26:28.240]  Rid of that material
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.240]  But if you've just got a little bit of a problem like people in Oregon this year got pummeled with powdery mildew and other molds
[26:33.240 --> 26:36.120]  This will not handle your brown mold. This will not handle shit like that
[26:36.120 --> 26:39.480]  But a little bit of powdery mildew this peroxide solution will get rid of it
[26:39.480 --> 26:40.560]  Yes, you can do it
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.800]  if you want to get the dust and the dirt off if you grew outside a lot of people find like
[26:45.240 --> 26:46.600]  Cocoons or
[26:46.600 --> 26:50.320]  Caterpillar silk on their buds. That would be a good way to get rid of that stuff
[26:50.320 --> 26:52.140]  Just give it a good dunk that way, you know, it's clean
[26:52.140 --> 26:56.720]  Just make sure you're getting plenty of ventilation plenty of airflow when it dries. It's gonna dry up like normal
[26:56.720 --> 26:58.560]  It's just gonna take a little bit longer
[26:58.560 --> 27:00.000]  You won't notice a difference
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.280]  I'm pretty sure you can take a bud that did not get dunked in a bud that did get dunked and dried properly and trimmed
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.660]  And cured properly and you can smoke them both and you will not be able to tell the difference
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.760]  That's my opinion on that. So yes, I've heard of this. I've seen it in practice
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.880]  I don't know that I have personally tried it, but I've seen it done. I've been places that have done it
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.800]  It's kind of a semi common practice in commercial grows to tell you the truth because it is legal in Colorado to do that
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.440]  Two buds grown in a commercial facility. All right. I think that's all I've got time for
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.960]  I don't want to start another email because I've been going for close to 30 minutes and it's hard to do a long episode
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.920]  By myself, I feel like I just start chattering get way off course
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.800]  So I'm gonna start wrapping up the show you guys
[27:38.800 --> 27:40.800]  I want to let you guys know about a
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.520]  Website known as patreon you guys feel like you want to contribute to the podcast
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.080]  Patreon is the way to do it you guys a lot of people have sent me a message like hey on the website
[27:48.080 --> 27:51.040]  You used to have a donation button and that is gone. What happened to that?
[27:51.600 --> 27:57.360]  PayPal did not like having their service attached to my website. There was about a podcast
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.400]  That was about growing cannabis. They felt like that was inappropriate and they didn't want to be involved
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.160]  So they made me take the PayPal link off of my website
[28:05.240 --> 28:10.100]  So that's gone. But what we can do we can set you up with patreon. I'm gonna pull up the website right here
[28:10.100 --> 28:12.880]  I've got it stored so that I can make sure to give you the right link. It is
[28:13.580 --> 28:16.180]  patreon p a t r e o n
[28:16.460 --> 28:17.660]  patreon.com
[28:17.660 --> 28:18.940]  Slash grow from your heart
[28:18.940 --> 28:19.860]  If you go there
[28:19.860 --> 28:24.220]  You can find out how to become a member of patreon how you can sign up and you can contribute to the podcast
[28:24.780 --> 28:26.780]  You can sign up and you can contribute
[28:26.940 --> 28:32.940]  It's like a monthly service if you want to contribute monthly you can throw as little as one dollar in every month
[28:32.940 --> 28:34.420]  I would totally appreciate it
[28:34.420 --> 28:38.900]  Honestly you guys what that is going for is it will pay for the web hosting for my website
[28:39.140 --> 28:40.740]  IREGENETICSCOLORADO.COM
[28:40.740 --> 28:44.460]  It does cost me a little bit of money to keep that running on a yearly basis
[28:44.460 --> 28:48.940]  I have to pay that fee and that's what keeps the grow from your heart podcast feed alive
[28:49.420 --> 28:52.340]  So that's all I'm asking for. I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast
[28:52.340 --> 28:57.380]  I'm just trying to offset the cost of my web fees. I've already bought the equipment sometimes shit breaks
[28:57.380 --> 29:02.740]  So maybe I'll ask on patreon for help with that. But so far I'm just trying to pay for the cost of the website
[29:02.740 --> 29:07.780]  I would appreciate it if you contributed I'm gonna quit begging because it already feels a little funky
[29:07.780 --> 29:10.420]  All right guys, I want to thank you guys for listening to another episode of the podcast
