[00:00.000 --> 00:03.640]  Hey, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers.
[00:03.640 --> 00:07.780]  It is time for episode 433 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.780 --> 00:10.680]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.680 --> 00:14.960]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:14.960 --> 00:20.320]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.320 --> 00:25.080]  Make sure you check out Seeds Here Now because they just got a fresh drop of irie genetics.
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.080]  That's right.
[00:26.080 --> 00:29.800]  If you want to get some Arise or some Sonic Boom, or maybe you want some Dragon Punch,
[00:29.800 --> 00:35.120]  they've got that available right now at seedsherenow.com.
[00:35.120 --> 00:38.520]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:38.520 --> 00:44.040]  I just took a gigantic dab of Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:44.040 --> 00:51.520]  The label says this product contains 61.9% THC and 73.6 total cannabinoids.
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.240]  Stardog is one of my favorite strains to grow and definitely one of my favorite strains
[00:55.240 --> 00:56.240]  to smoke.
[00:56.240 --> 01:02.280]  So, big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Stardog Ambrosia Batter.
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.440]  In this episode, I'm going to go over a really long listener email that contains multiple
[01:06.440 --> 01:07.440]  questions.
[01:07.440 --> 01:09.760]  I'm going to briefly cover each of those questions.
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.800]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:13.800 --> 01:18.040]  How about a big ladies first shout out to my friend Miss Mel, a big gigantic Grow From
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.080]  Your Heart podcast shout out to our friend Canna You Dig It, a giant Grow From Your Heart
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.720]  podcast shout out to Hogan Farms, of course a big Viking handshake to my friend Grimball
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.480]  the Druid, and last but certainly not least, I want to give a big high elevation shout
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.680]  out to our friend Bag Seed Jesse.
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.520]  I want to thank everybody for all of the continued Patreon support.
[01:37.520 --> 01:44.600]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.600]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.520]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.800]  I know I mentioned it earlier in the show, but in the past couple of episodes, I have
[01:52.800 --> 01:56.600]  talked about my seeds being available on seedsherenow.com.
[01:56.600 --> 01:59.200]  Thanks for being patient with me after the holiday weekend.
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.680]  It is time to officially announce that Irie Genetics seeds are available on seedsherenow.com.
[02:04.680 --> 02:10.560]  I want to give a big shout out to James Bean and the entire Seeds Here Now crew.
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.160]  It is an honor and a pleasure to be a part of the Seeds Here Now team.
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.680]  Make sure you guys check out seedsherenow.com and grab yourself some Irie Genetics.
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.200]  The Golden Goat BX sold out in just a couple of hours.
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.800]  They do have a lot of a rise and they have a lot of other great varieties available.
[02:27.800 --> 02:33.160]  I will be restocking that Golden Goat very soon, so make sure you check out seedsherenow.com.
[02:33.160 --> 02:35.840]  All right, podcast world.
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.920]  At the start of the show, I said I was going to read a long email with multiple questions.
[02:39.920 --> 02:42.000]  Let's get into that portion of the show.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.140]  If you have got a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question and you would like me
[02:46.140 --> 02:49.340]  to read that question on the show, you can send me an email.
[02:49.340 --> 02:54.760]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com and you know I would love to hear from you.
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.560]  This message for today's episode goes just like this.
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.720]  Dear Rasta Jeff, this is my second email to you.
[03:01.720 --> 03:05.760]  My first message was read on episode 350, so cheers, dude.
[03:05.760 --> 03:08.220]  You are welcome to read my name out loud.
[03:08.220 --> 03:12.340]  This message comes from our friend John and it goes a lot like this.
[03:12.340 --> 03:13.340]  A couple of things.
[03:13.340 --> 03:18.180]  I heard you call out for music on podcast 400 and I will see what I can do for you.
[03:18.180 --> 03:22.540]  I checked out Phish to get an idea of what you like and I will see what I can come up with.
[03:22.540 --> 03:24.300]  Hey, that's pretty cool of you, man.
[03:24.300 --> 03:27.460]  Don't try to make too much of a fishy sound for an intro.
[03:27.460 --> 03:32.180]  I would prefer something kind of reggae, kind of up-tempo reggae, kind of kicks in the door.
[03:32.180 --> 03:35.780]  Remember how we used to start it with that beat that would just kick off right away?
[03:35.780 --> 03:38.420]  Something that kicks down the door and says, hey, it's time for a podcast.
[03:38.420 --> 03:39.420]  That's what I would love.
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.660]  Something kind of reggae-like.
[03:40.660 --> 03:43.740]  If you made a Phish-type song, I will certainly play it.
[03:43.740 --> 03:44.740]  That sounds great.
[03:44.740 --> 03:47.540]  So yes, I did ask for music on episode 400.
[03:47.540 --> 03:49.220]  I did not get a new theme song.
[03:49.220 --> 03:53.140]  If anybody out there would like to make a theme song, like I said, something reggae,
[03:53.140 --> 03:57.220]  something that kicks in the door, something that has not been posted to YouTube before
[03:57.220 --> 04:01.300]  because if you have already posted it to YouTube, YouTube will flag me when I post it and say
[04:01.300 --> 04:02.860]  that I am stealing your content.
[04:02.860 --> 04:06.940]  So it's got to be fresh, original material if you'd like me to play it on the show.
[04:06.940 --> 04:08.900]  So so far, John, you are off to a great start.
[04:08.900 --> 04:12.340]  You are making me an intro that probably sounds like Phish, and I appreciate that.
[04:12.340 --> 04:13.620]  I will play it on the show.
[04:13.620 --> 04:15.200]  It will make a great vibe.
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.200]  There is more to the message.
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.340]  It says, a few grow questions, and this is where it gets fun.
[04:20.340 --> 04:22.700]  Question number A, budget grows.
[04:22.700 --> 04:25.300]  How do I control humidity when the lights go out?
[04:25.300 --> 04:29.340]  When it is time for the girls to go to bed, there is always a huge humidity spike, which
[04:29.340 --> 04:31.980]  is difficult to control on a budget.
[04:32.100 --> 04:37.660]  I have a cheap 100 pound, not the weight, but the price, 100 pound dehumidifier, which
[04:37.660 --> 04:42.580]  removes moisture from the air and is fine whilst the lights are on, but fails to control
[04:42.580 --> 04:46.080]  the humidity during darkness humidity spikes.
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.580]  It would be worse without the dehumidifier, but it struggles to get the RH down to desired
[04:50.580 --> 04:52.500]  levels during darkness.
[04:52.500 --> 04:57.780]  Is this a fact of life for all gardeners, unless you have access to serious equipment?
[04:57.780 --> 05:01.500]  I can't afford a better dehumidifier or the power to run it.
[05:01.500 --> 05:05.060]  Any tips for a novice grower on a brutal budget?
[05:05.060 --> 05:07.740]  This listener has a very common problem.
[05:07.740 --> 05:12.300]  When the lights go out in their grow environment, the humidity spikes drastically.
[05:12.300 --> 05:15.740]  This person is getting concerned that it may cause a problem in their grow, and they need
[05:15.740 --> 05:20.980]  a way to control that humidity without spending a ton of money, perhaps without spending any
[05:20.980 --> 05:21.980]  money.
[05:21.980 --> 05:22.980]  They said that the budget is low.
[05:22.980 --> 05:26.580]  They cannot afford a better dehumidifier or even the power to run it.
[05:26.580 --> 05:30.060]  Let's talk about things that we could do, things that need to be done.
[05:30.060 --> 05:33.940]  The first thing I would suggest is maybe turn on the dehumidifier earlier.
[05:33.940 --> 05:37.500]  I don't know when you were starting that dehumidifier, so I don't know when it is starting to remove
[05:37.500 --> 05:39.220]  the moisture from the air.
[05:39.220 --> 05:41.940]  Your problem is happening right when the lights go off.
[05:41.940 --> 05:46.260]  Maybe if we start turning on the dehumidifier an hour before the lights go off, we can start
[05:46.260 --> 05:49.860]  prepping the environment and removing some of the air beforehand.
[05:49.860 --> 05:52.300]  Now what's going to happen is the lights are going to go off and the plants are going to
[05:52.300 --> 05:55.940]  start respiring and transpiring, and they're going to let out moisture.
[05:55.940 --> 06:00.100]  But maybe we can remove enough moisture from the air before the lights go off to where
[06:00.100 --> 06:03.940]  when the lights do go off, it is not such a drastic swing.
[06:03.940 --> 06:09.060]  So maybe when the lights are on, you're running about 50% humidity, maybe 40% humidity.
[06:09.060 --> 06:13.140]  When the lights go off, you're probably peaking up to 60, 70, maybe 80% humidity.
[06:13.140 --> 06:15.080]  I don't know your environment.
[06:15.080 --> 06:20.220]  Maybe if we start turning on that dehumidifier one, maybe two hours before lights go off,
[06:20.220 --> 06:25.400]  we can reduce the amount of moisture in that air low enough to compensate for that giant
[06:25.400 --> 06:28.160]  swing when it does happen, when the lights go off.
[06:28.160 --> 06:30.200]  That is going to be my first plan of attack.
[06:30.200 --> 06:33.080]  Try to get ahead of the humidity problem before it happens.
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.200]  We know it's going to happen.
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.880]  We know when it's going to happen.
[06:35.880 --> 06:39.400]  Maybe we can remove moisture from the air before that time comes and give ourselves
[06:39.400 --> 06:40.400]  a head start.
[06:40.400 --> 06:43.000]  Now, I don't know how large your grow space is.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.240]  I don't have a lot of details on your grow environment.
[06:45.240 --> 06:46.640]  I don't know how many plants are in there.
[06:46.640 --> 06:48.720]  I don't know what size containers those plants are in.
[06:48.720 --> 06:52.960]  I don't know how much moisture you are adding to the room or how frequently that is happening.
[06:52.960 --> 06:58.000]  So with the small amount of information I have got, I don't have a lot to work with.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.520]  No matter what size that environment is, I think you need to install some sort of extraction
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.360]  fan to remove the humidity from that environment and send it somewhere else.
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.980]  If you've got a small grow tent, something like maybe a four-inch extraction fan, maybe
[07:11.980 --> 07:15.120]  a computer fan up in the top corner would work.
[07:15.120 --> 07:16.400]  That may be efficient.
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.680]  Anything to help pull some of that stale humid air out of that environment would be beneficial.
[07:21.120 --> 07:25.080]  Now, if you have something larger, you may need a larger extraction fan.
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.400]  I don't know your environment.
[07:26.400 --> 07:28.200]  I don't know the size of your space.
[07:28.200 --> 07:30.480]  I don't know how much moisture is in there.
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.280]  But your best bet next to another dehumidifier would be some way of extracting that humid
[07:35.280 --> 07:37.240]  air from that room.
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.720]  Something like a squirrel cage blower or something like a vortex fan or something like a can
[07:41.720 --> 07:45.000]  fan, something to move that old air out of the room.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.520]  I keep saying I don't know how large your environment is.
[07:47.520 --> 07:51.920]  The size of your grow space is going to determine how much air you need to move out of that
[07:51.920 --> 07:52.920]  room.
[07:52.920 --> 07:56.360]  Now, when you go sucking air out of the room, you start thinking about odor.
[07:56.360 --> 08:00.680]  That's when you start thinking about a carbon filter, which is when this starts to get expensive.
[08:00.680 --> 08:04.480]  I don't know if you've got neighbors or people that you need to conceal the aroma from, but
[08:04.480 --> 08:08.960]  if you were extracting your odor outside of your home or to somewhere other people may
[08:08.960 --> 08:12.600]  come in contact with that air, you need to clean the aroma out of that air.
[08:12.600 --> 08:14.240]  So you will need a carbon filter.
[08:14.240 --> 08:17.600]  I've done a full episode on carbon filters.
[08:17.600 --> 08:22.040]  Episode number 430 is all about a carbon filter and where to place that filter.
[08:22.040 --> 08:25.520]  That lesson would apply greatly to your question here.
[08:25.520 --> 08:29.600]  Now I know you were on a budget, but this is what I would do if this were possible.
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.320]  I would get the appropriate size extraction fan for your grow environment.
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.100]  I would try to hang that extraction fan in the top center of my flowering room.
[08:39.100 --> 08:43.360]  If you can get it as high as possible and in the dead center, that is your best bet.
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.360]  I understand that ceiling space is limited.
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.000]  I understand that height is limited and I understand that things are heavy, so we can't
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.620]  always mount things to the ceiling, but that is the best place for this extraction fan.
[08:53.620 --> 08:55.320]  So I would hang that fan from the ceiling.
[08:55.320 --> 08:59.040]  Then I would run ducting from that ceiling to the wall.
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.400]  Then I would cut the appropriate size hole in the wall and I would run that ducting through
[09:03.400 --> 09:04.400]  the wall.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.560]  Now I don't know where it needs to go once it gets out of that room.
[09:06.560 --> 09:09.180]  Do you need to run it even further down another hallway?
[09:09.180 --> 09:11.200]  Is that going outside at that point?
[09:11.200 --> 09:13.040]  That's a whole nother thing to think about.
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.200]  So now you are sucking air through that blower, you're blowing it down the ducting and it
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.480]  is going out of your grow environment.
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.240]  You're going to remove heat and you're going to remove humidity by doing so.
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.320]  At the same time, you are going to be blasting odoriferous cannabis scented air straight
[09:27.320 --> 09:29.760]  through that ducting wherever that air ends up.
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.060]  So that is when I recommend a carbon filter.
[09:32.060 --> 09:36.440]  I would recommend you hang a carbon filter, then your blower, then your ducting out of
[09:36.440 --> 09:37.720]  the grow environment.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.800]  Now I do understand that earlier you said you don't have a budget to work with.
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.280]  You said you cannot afford a better dehumidifier and you said you cannot afford the power to
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.280]  run it.
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.240]  If you can't afford a big expensive blower and a carbon filter, maybe something like
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.800]  a small computer fan, anything that will just blow some air out of that room from the top
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.200]  would be helpful.
[09:56.200 --> 09:59.880]  Now I understand that buying a blower and buying a carbon filter and buying ducting
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.060]  does cost money and I really don't have a more affordable solution.
[10:04.060 --> 10:08.520]  That humid air either needs to be sucked out or blown out of that room or treated by the
[10:08.520 --> 10:09.520]  dehumidifier.
[10:09.520 --> 10:11.360]  Those are basically your two options.
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.320]  Other things we can think about are where is excess water coming from?
[10:15.320 --> 10:18.080]  Do you have any standing water in that room?
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.000]  After you water, is there water left in your catch tray or your runoff saucer or whatever
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  you're using?
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.740]  Is there water left in the room?
[10:24.740 --> 10:28.440]  Maybe you can use a shop vac and suck that up and get that out of the room.
[10:28.440 --> 10:32.520]  Another thing that will help, and this may sound crazy, is a little bit of defoliation.
[10:32.520 --> 10:35.100]  If those leaves aren't there, they can't let out water.
[10:35.100 --> 10:38.640]  So that may be another way to help combat your humidity issue.
[10:38.760 --> 10:40.400]  Hopefully one of those options work.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.480]  Maybe a combination of those things will help you out.
[10:42.480 --> 10:47.200]  I'm sorry I don't have a really easy solution that will fix this that could be free.
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.080]  It sounds like you may have to spend a few bucks on this.
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.840]  If you do go with the blower route, I highly recommend that carbon filter because a carbon
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.840]  filter, a blower, and some ducting is much more affordable than a court case for an illegal
[10:59.840 --> 11:00.840]  grow.
[11:00.840 --> 11:04.640]  All right, there are a lot of questions in this email, so let's keep moving.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.160]  Question number B says, low stress training.
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.360]  When should it start?
[11:09.360 --> 11:11.200]  Is there a method to the madness?
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.200]  Are scrognets worth the hassle if LST has been done properly?
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.120]  And is there anything you should not do when low stress training?
[11:20.120 --> 11:21.580]  That's a lot to think about.
[11:21.580 --> 11:26.360]  You can start LST as soon as those plants are thick enough and robust enough to handle
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.060]  being cracked, being twisted, being manipulated.
[11:29.060 --> 11:32.000]  If you feel like the plant can take it, go for it.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.720]  Usually I would wait for them to get about the thickness of a Bic pen or a pencil before
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.600]  I start cracking on them, but you can start as soon as you feel like they can take a little
[11:39.600 --> 11:40.600]  bit of abuse.
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.880]  And that is going to be strain and maybe phenotype specific, so be careful with that.
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.480]  Now there is a method to the madness.
[11:47.480 --> 11:50.680]  I'm not sure what type of low stress training you are doing.
[11:50.680 --> 11:53.060]  There are very many different options that you can do.
[11:53.060 --> 11:55.800]  I like to grab the plant and give it a little twist and pop it.
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.540]  I like to do that a lot.
[11:57.540 --> 12:01.960]  The method to that is to grab it kind of close to the stalk, put your other hand above it
[12:01.960 --> 12:03.320]  and twist and just pop.
[12:03.320 --> 12:04.320]  You'll hear it pop.
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.520]  And then I do like that thing we used to do in school and we tried to decide who goes
[12:07.520 --> 12:10.880]  first in baseball, where you put your hand on the bat and the next guy puts his hand
[12:10.880 --> 12:13.800]  above yours, the next guy puts his hand above yours.
[12:13.800 --> 12:15.160]  That's how I measure my crack distance.
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.120]  I go crack and I put my hand above it, crack, put my hand above it, crack, and I just work
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.480]  my way up the stem.
[12:20.480 --> 12:22.240]  That is my method to that madness.
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.040]  I start at the main stalk of the plant and I go all the way up until it gets kind of
[12:26.040 --> 12:27.960]  skinny until I'm up to the top.
[12:27.960 --> 12:32.560]  Then I do that to every single branch, starting at the lowest branch and work my way up that
[12:32.560 --> 12:34.880]  branch, then to the next branch and work my way up.
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.960]  I pop the shit out of those plants.
[12:36.960 --> 12:38.720]  That is the method to my madness.
[12:38.720 --> 12:42.800]  Again, there are several different methods and approaches to low stress training.
[12:42.800 --> 12:44.360]  I'm not sure what you're doing.
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.000]  As long as you have a goal in mind and you were observing what is happening, there is
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.740]  a method to your madness.
[12:49.740 --> 12:53.040]  Don't just go in there and do a bunch of different shit and don't pay attention.
[12:53.040 --> 12:56.840]  If you're going to do something to plant A and something to plant B, have a reason, make
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.280]  a note of what you did, why you did it, and which plant you did it to, and then there
[13:00.280 --> 13:02.260]  is a method to your madness.
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.860]  The next question is, are Scrognettes worth it if the LST is done correctly?
[13:06.860 --> 13:07.860]  Yes.
[13:07.860 --> 13:09.500]  I really like a Scrognette.
[13:09.500 --> 13:13.100]  I feel like when the top buds start getting kind of heavy and floppy, if you've got one,
[13:13.100 --> 13:16.380]  two, maybe even three layers of Scrognettes, you don't need to get in there with a bunch
[13:16.380 --> 13:17.380]  of sticks.
[13:17.380 --> 13:22.580]  Hopefully, your buds are going to get so big and fat that your branches can't support them.
[13:22.580 --> 13:26.220]  Even after all of that low stress training, you're still going to get big, fat, giant
[13:26.220 --> 13:28.580]  buds that those sticks are not ready for.
[13:28.580 --> 13:32.780]  In any commercial environment, which I am responsible for, I always run a screen of
[13:32.780 --> 13:33.860]  green system.
[13:33.860 --> 13:37.740]  I usually set up one screen to kind of spread the plants apart a little bit.
[13:37.740 --> 13:41.140]  The second screen is to kind of guide them to get them going straight up, to put them
[13:41.140 --> 13:43.060]  in the position where I want the branches.
[13:43.060 --> 13:48.340]  The third one is to support those big, gigantic, floppy buds that will happen around week five,
[13:48.340 --> 13:52.620]  six, seven, and they continue all the way through week nine or 10, whenever we harvest.
[13:52.620 --> 13:53.760]  They're just going to get bigger.
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.040]  They're going to get floppier.
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.260]  You don't want to get in there with a bunch of sticks and bamboo sticks and tomato cages
[13:58.260 --> 13:59.260]  and shit.
[13:59.260 --> 14:03.100]  I think those screens really are worth their weight in gold and they're definitely worth
[14:03.100 --> 14:04.100]  the hassle.
[14:04.100 --> 14:06.180]  Once you get good at hanging them up, they're not that hard.
[14:06.180 --> 14:09.900]  It almost becomes as easy as making a bed once you learn how to do it.
[14:09.900 --> 14:13.180]  In a commercial environment, I like to find another guy that's as tall as myself.
[14:13.180 --> 14:14.180]  I'm six five.
[14:14.180 --> 14:18.180]  If I can find another guy that's like six foot or six two, we can hang up trellis all
[14:18.180 --> 14:19.180]  day.
[14:19.180 --> 14:20.180]  No problem.
[14:20.180 --> 14:21.180]  It is super fast and super easy.
[14:21.180 --> 14:26.100]  Then to wrap up question B, he asks, is there anything you would not do when low stress
[14:26.100 --> 14:27.100]  training?
[14:27.420 --> 14:32.580]  Really, the only way to learn what not to do is to do some shit and see it go wrong.
[14:32.580 --> 14:35.060]  That is the best way to learn anything in a garden.
[14:35.060 --> 14:37.380]  So try some shit, experiment.
[14:37.380 --> 14:41.300]  When you try three or four things and one or two of them absolutely fail, those are
[14:41.300 --> 14:43.180]  the things not to do again.
[14:43.180 --> 14:46.220]  I really don't know what else to tell you not to do because I don't know what you're
[14:46.220 --> 14:47.220]  planning.
[14:47.220 --> 14:50.220]  I don't see your devious little mind plotting what's going to happen in that grow.
[14:50.220 --> 14:51.860]  So I don't know what to tell you not to do.
[14:51.860 --> 14:55.700]  What I can tell you is to think twice before you do anything.
[14:55.700 --> 14:58.860]  You can always cut later, but you can't put shit back.
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.860]  So think about it.
[14:59.860 --> 15:03.220]  If you're going to do something crazy, look at the plants, think about what you're going
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.220]  to do.
[15:04.220 --> 15:06.420]  Think to yourself, why am I going to do that?
[15:06.420 --> 15:08.020]  What is my desired outcome?
[15:08.020 --> 15:10.700]  What is it going to look like immediately after I do that?
[15:10.700 --> 15:13.740]  What is it going to look like in 12 hours after I do that?
[15:13.740 --> 15:15.500]  What's it going to look like in three days?
[15:15.500 --> 15:17.820]  What will it be like in two weeks after I do this?
[15:17.820 --> 15:21.980]  How is this going to affect my final outcome of my finished product?
[15:21.980 --> 15:26.380]  Then before you do that crazy shit you're thinking about, go smoke a joint, go for
[15:26.380 --> 15:30.860]  a walk, go play on the internet, then come back and rethink your shit and see if it is
[15:30.860 --> 15:32.700]  something you really want to do.
[15:32.700 --> 15:37.660]  Because like I said a moment ago, you can always cut more off, but you can't glue leaves
[15:37.660 --> 15:39.500]  or plant parts back on.
[15:39.500 --> 15:42.840]  So think about everything twice before you're going to do it.
[15:42.840 --> 15:44.860]  Smoke a joint, think about it again.
[15:44.860 --> 15:48.700]  Maybe ask a friend, maybe send me an email, maybe go look on a forum.
[15:48.700 --> 15:52.100]  Get an educated decision before you do anything crazy.
[15:52.100 --> 15:54.060]  So that is what I would say not to do.
[15:54.060 --> 15:57.540]  Don't do anything ridiculous without thoroughly, thoroughly thinking it through.
[15:57.540 --> 16:00.020]  All right, we are ripping right through this message.
[16:00.020 --> 16:05.420]  Let's work on question number C. Question number C says, best seed company in the UK
[16:05.420 --> 16:07.920]  or Europe for reliable genetics.
[16:07.920 --> 16:08.920]  Any recommendations?
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.920]  I would like to try your Lemon Jeffrey and Golden Goat, but I have a difficulty sourcing
[16:13.920 --> 16:16.740]  them in the UK or Europe.
[16:16.740 --> 16:18.340]  I understand that frustration.
[16:18.980 --> 16:22.100]  I get messages like this every day that people overseas would like to get their hands on
[16:22.100 --> 16:24.020]  some iReed Genetic Seeds.
[16:24.020 --> 16:30.380]  The best advice I've got for you there is to try seedsherenow.com, oregoneeliteseeds.com,
[16:30.380 --> 16:32.980]  or dankseed.store.
[16:32.980 --> 16:34.100]  They may be able to help you out.
[16:34.100 --> 16:35.740]  I do not know their shipping policies.
[16:35.740 --> 16:38.740]  I do not know where they are willing to ship seeds.
[16:38.740 --> 16:42.580]  But if you're interested in strictly iReed Genetics, those are the three top vendors
[16:42.580 --> 16:43.580]  that I would recommend.
[16:43.580 --> 16:52.380]  Again, that is seedsherenow.com, oregoneliteseeds.com, and dankseed.store.
[16:52.380 --> 16:56.180]  Those are my three top vendors right now that may be able to get products to you in the
[16:56.180 --> 16:57.580]  UK or Europe.
[16:57.580 --> 17:02.980]  Now, even if you do contact a vendor that can get seeds to you in the UK or in Europe,
[17:02.980 --> 17:08.260]  you will not be able to get any Lemon Jeffrey or Feminized Golden Goat seeds until at least
[17:08.260 --> 17:09.680]  the middle of July.
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.780]  Those seeds are not ready yet.
[17:10.780 --> 17:14.340]  They are currently sold out at almost every outlet that I know of.
[17:14.340 --> 17:15.720]  I am making more right now.
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.180]  They are almost done, but they will not be available anywhere until July.
[17:20.180 --> 17:25.300]  All right, let's work our way into question number D. Question D on this email goes like
[17:25.300 --> 17:26.300]  this.
[17:26.300 --> 17:27.300]  Upgrade.
[17:27.300 --> 17:32.420]  So if you start with a one meter square budget tent, a 400 watt light, a small dehumidifier,
[17:32.420 --> 17:36.580]  and a four inch extractor fan, at some point you will want to upgrade.
[17:36.580 --> 17:38.580]  Now you've just given me a really good idea of your grow.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.820]  I wish you would have started with that.
[17:39.860 --> 17:44.140]  I would have had more accurate, better, more clear advice, but this is where we are now,
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.520]  so let's keep going.
[17:45.520 --> 17:49.740]  The question is, can you give me any advice on upgrading?
[17:49.740 --> 17:54.480]  As many upgrades I suspect will only give you tiny gains and may be rather pointless
[17:54.480 --> 18:00.300]  unless you are upping your game altogether to a much larger grow with commercial aspirations.
[18:00.300 --> 18:03.020]  Are there any big gains for small grows?
[18:03.020 --> 18:07.460]  Then he says, by the way, I appreciate that the best gains are achieved by knowing and
[18:07.460 --> 18:08.700]  loving your plant.
[18:08.700 --> 18:09.980]  Yes, absolutely.
[18:09.980 --> 18:15.100]  Understanding the plants, developing a relationship with each cultivar is the best way to improve
[18:15.100 --> 18:16.980]  and grow top notch product.
[18:16.980 --> 18:18.940]  But let's look at the equipment you've already got.
[18:18.940 --> 18:20.380]  You've got a decent light.
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.120]  You have got a small dehumidifier.
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.980]  It sounds like you need a larger dehumidifier already is the thing you need to step up.
[18:26.980 --> 18:29.200]  You've got a four inch extractor fan.
[18:29.200 --> 18:31.060]  Maybe you need a better extractor fan.
[18:31.060 --> 18:33.500]  Those are the two things for you to focus on right now.
[18:33.500 --> 18:36.860]  It says at some point you're going to want to upgrade to a better light and a better
[18:36.860 --> 18:39.020]  dehumidifier and a better tent.
[18:39.020 --> 18:42.700]  Not necessarily a larger tent, but you'd like advice on that.
[18:42.700 --> 18:44.580]  I generally start with lighting.
[18:44.580 --> 18:49.600]  I like to buy the highest quality light I can afford and the most efficient light for
[18:49.600 --> 18:50.860]  my space.
[18:50.860 --> 18:54.620]  In today's modern market, grow lights are constantly changing.
[18:54.620 --> 18:58.580]  So I would try to find the most efficient, most effective light that I can afford for
[18:58.580 --> 18:59.580]  that space.
[18:59.580 --> 19:01.020]  That's where I would start.
[19:01.020 --> 19:04.620]  Then I would work on cooling that area and controlling the environment.
[19:04.620 --> 19:08.660]  I would work on dehumidification and removing stale hot air out of there.
[19:08.660 --> 19:11.620]  So you're going to need that extractor fan and a carbon filter.
[19:11.620 --> 19:13.860]  That's the next thing I would work on.
[19:13.860 --> 19:17.540]  Then I would work on cooling the environment in which that tent is in.
[19:17.540 --> 19:19.900]  I wouldn't necessarily cool the inside of the tent.
[19:19.900 --> 19:24.700]  I would cool the room which the tent is living in and that air would then cycle into that
[19:24.700 --> 19:25.860]  tent.
[19:25.860 --> 19:27.260]  So I would start with lighting.
[19:27.260 --> 19:28.860]  Then I would work on airflow.
[19:28.860 --> 19:30.780]  Then I would focus on cooling the tent.
[19:30.780 --> 19:35.300]  Now that we've got our light and our environment dialed in, it is time to work on automation.
[19:35.300 --> 19:38.380]  The first step to automation is knowing what is going on in the grow room.
[19:38.380 --> 19:41.940]  So you'll need something that can monitor your environment, something that can pay attention
[19:41.940 --> 19:45.580]  to temperature and humidity at all times.
[19:45.580 --> 19:50.060]  Then I like to have some sort of a device that can react to those inputs.
[19:50.060 --> 19:53.700]  Maybe I've got some sort of a device that tells me, hey, Rasta Jeff, it is now too humid
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.060]  in your grow room.
[19:55.060 --> 19:59.100]  At that point, I want something to trigger on to reduce that humidity.
[19:59.100 --> 20:01.660]  A good example would be a Smartbee unit.
[20:01.660 --> 20:05.620]  You can plug a Smartbee stinger into any wall outlet.
[20:05.620 --> 20:09.100]  Then you can plug your dehumidifier into that Smartbee.
[20:09.100 --> 20:10.900]  You plug it into spot number one.
[20:10.900 --> 20:13.380]  You assign number one to dehumidification.
[20:13.380 --> 20:18.300]  Then you tell your Smartbee sensor, hey, I want it to be 50% humidity in this room.
[20:18.300 --> 20:22.540]  If it gets higher than that, turn on that dehumidifier and it will do that for you.
[20:22.540 --> 20:24.200]  The monitor will pay attention.
[20:24.200 --> 20:27.860]  As soon as it hits 52% humidity in that room, it'll say, hey, guess what?
[20:27.900 --> 20:29.340]  Rasta Jeff wants it 50%.
[20:29.340 --> 20:32.300]  I need to turn on slot number A on that stinger.
[20:32.300 --> 20:34.020]  Your dehumidifier will fire up.
[20:34.020 --> 20:36.260]  You will suck out the humidity in that room.
[20:36.260 --> 20:39.580]  You can also put an extraction fan on that same stinger.
[20:39.580 --> 20:42.920]  Throw it on slot number two, put it on dehumidification.
[20:42.920 --> 20:47.560]  That way when it gets too humid, your dehumidifier comes on and your extraction fan comes on and
[20:47.560 --> 20:50.860]  now you are dehumidifying that room.
[20:50.860 --> 20:54.580]  Once you've got good equipment, I like to add monitors followed by automation.
[20:54.580 --> 20:58.140]  I think monitors and automation make things very easy.
[20:58.140 --> 21:00.300]  Cannabis plants love consistency.
[21:00.300 --> 21:04.340]  If you automate simple things like watering and dehumidifying, that saves you a lot of
[21:04.340 --> 21:08.340]  time for doing other things in the grow, like the low stress training, like the popping
[21:08.340 --> 21:12.660]  and twisting, like defoliating, like scouting for bugs, like all of the other things that
[21:12.660 --> 21:17.900]  get pushed aside because we're too busy doing things we could have and should have automated.
[21:17.900 --> 21:19.200]  I would start with the lights.
[21:19.200 --> 21:21.740]  Then I would work on climate control and air conditioning.
[21:21.740 --> 21:23.240]  Then I would go to monitoring.
[21:23.240 --> 21:25.200]  Then I would work on automation.
[21:25.200 --> 21:30.120]  Then if you really want to step it up, it is time to start adding CO2 to your grow room.
[21:30.120 --> 21:32.120]  You want to supplement CO2.
[21:32.120 --> 21:36.720]  Ambient CO2 in most environments on earth is around 400 ppms.
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.920]  Our cannabis plants can thrive in much higher levels of CO2.
[21:40.920 --> 21:42.480]  They will grow more rapidly.
[21:42.480 --> 21:43.880]  They will grow with more vigor.
[21:43.880 --> 21:46.520]  They will become larger with less time.
[21:46.520 --> 21:51.280]  So supplementing, augmenting CO2 in your grow environment is a great way to improve your
[21:51.280 --> 21:52.280]  grow room.
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.040]  You will increase the harvest weight.
[21:54.040 --> 21:55.720]  You will decrease grow time.
[21:55.720 --> 21:59.360]  You will increase overall quality of your finished product.
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.560]  Now that is the equipment.
[22:00.560 --> 22:04.280]  You also need to make sure that you are feeding the best nutrients you can feed.
[22:04.280 --> 22:06.560]  You need to make sure that each feed is dialed in.
[22:06.560 --> 22:11.720]  Also, I suggest good pH pens and EC meters.
[22:11.720 --> 22:14.960]  I also recommend you calibrate those devices regularly.
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.200]  Those devices don't do you any good if they are not calibrated properly.
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.440]  So that is a list of options and things you can do to upgrade your grow room.
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.240]  Keep in mind that grow room equipment is constantly changing and evolving.
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.600]  Especially with legalization, people are able to research more.
[22:31.600 --> 22:35.360]  People are able to advertise their product as a cannabis specific product.
[22:35.360 --> 22:37.940]  So things are developing and changing rapidly.
[22:37.940 --> 22:43.240]  So do a lot of research and buy quality products that you think will have longevity.
[22:43.240 --> 22:46.200]  Don't fall for gimmicky shit in the grow world.
[22:46.200 --> 22:49.140]  Try to find a company that will answer you when you send them an email.
[22:49.180 --> 22:52.660]  Try to find a company that will respond to you if you've got a problem.
[22:52.660 --> 22:55.340]  Customer service is huge in this industry.
[22:55.340 --> 23:00.460]  Now I keep saying it, no matter how much great shit you buy, nothing ever will make up for
[23:00.460 --> 23:05.460]  building a relationship with the plant and understanding the plants we are growing.
[23:05.460 --> 23:09.860]  Something that will probably improve your garden more than anything is a solid grow
[23:09.860 --> 23:11.300]  book.
[23:11.300 --> 23:16.860]  Go buy a cannabis specific grow book that was written by a reputable cannabis grower
[23:16.860 --> 23:18.940]  and a reputable author.
[23:18.940 --> 23:23.260]  Then once you've got that book, the next step is to read the book.
[23:23.260 --> 23:27.820]  Those books do you no good if you buy them and sit them on that bookshelf by the toilet.
[23:27.820 --> 23:28.820]  I've seen it.
[23:28.820 --> 23:29.820]  I've been to your house.
[23:29.820 --> 23:32.300]  I picked up that grow Bible that is right by your toilet.
[23:32.300 --> 23:34.580]  The spine of that book has never been cracked.
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.580]  Fucking open it and read it.
[23:35.580 --> 23:38.100]  It's not going to do you any good sitting there on the shelf.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.540]  The knowledge isn't going to fly out of the book into your head.
[23:40.540 --> 23:42.580]  You have to open it and read it.
[23:42.580 --> 23:47.040]  Then once you are done reading that grow book, the next step is to buy another grow book
[23:47.120 --> 23:49.880]  from a different author and read that one.
[23:49.880 --> 23:54.960]  Then combine the knowledge you got from both books and develop your own understanding for
[23:54.960 --> 23:57.160]  these plants.
[23:57.160 --> 24:01.560]  Understanding the plants we are growing and having a solid goal will be more useful than
[24:01.560 --> 24:06.760]  any piece of equipment you could buy at any grow store on Amazon or any sort of wizardry
[24:06.760 --> 24:08.440]  you could ever find.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.920]  Learn the plants.
[24:09.920 --> 24:12.640]  Develop a relationship with each cultivar.
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.640]  Touch it.
[24:13.640 --> 24:14.640]  Feel it.
[24:14.640 --> 24:15.640]  Smell it.
[24:15.640 --> 24:16.640]  Pay attention to it.
[24:17.240 --> 24:21.840]  All of that is free and that is probably the best way to improve your garden.
[24:21.840 --> 24:23.440]  All right, that was a good rant.
[24:23.440 --> 24:24.440]  That was a great question.
[24:24.440 --> 24:25.440]  Thank you for that.
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.640]  That wraps up the portion question of this email, but there is more.
[24:29.640 --> 24:30.640]  It goes on.
[24:30.640 --> 24:34.520]  Section three says, please give a big shout out for White Mike.
[24:34.520 --> 24:36.640]  Hey, White Mike, you're getting another shout out on the show.
[24:36.640 --> 24:39.560]  It is time for you to come be on the podcast.
[24:39.560 --> 24:40.560]  The message continues.
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.120]  It says, I heard that a few listeners did not relish Mike's whiter industry view.
[24:45.120 --> 24:47.440]  I do not agree at all.
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.080]  I love White Mike's contribution to the podcast.
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.120]  People like Mike and yourself remove the stigma of a bunch of potheads justifying their own
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.280]  habits by presenting a mature, thoughtful, and well-reasoned approach to the industry
[25:01.280 --> 25:02.920]  and the culture.
[25:02.920 --> 25:04.080]  That is a great sentence.
[25:04.080 --> 25:05.080]  I love that.
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.080]  Thank you, man.
[25:06.080 --> 25:07.080]  That means a lot to me.
[25:07.080 --> 25:10.200]  I kind of wanted to start the show to break some of the myths, dispel some of the rumors
[25:10.200 --> 25:13.560]  about cannabis, kind of take some of the fear away from cannabis.
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.320]  I'm glad that you see that we're trying to do it in a professional manner.
[25:17.320 --> 25:18.840]  I appreciate that.
[25:18.840 --> 25:19.840]  The message continues.
[25:19.840 --> 25:25.280]  It says, this helps to break down the bigoted views and any lingering stigma from 100 plus
[25:25.280 --> 25:26.840]  years of prohibition.
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.240]  I particularly loved episode 400 in which you, Mike, and another guest discussed the
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.160]  things that you do not like about the business, regulations, and the culture.
[25:37.160 --> 25:40.640]  Your guest was not a fan of dab rigs because they looked like drugs.
[25:40.640 --> 25:41.640]  That was our friend Clint.
[25:41.640 --> 25:42.640]  Big shout out to Clint.
[25:42.720 --> 25:44.280]  Thank you for listening to the podcast, bro.
[25:44.280 --> 25:47.160]  I thought that was such a good discussion to have.
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.200]  I have no issue with dab rigs, but I totally get the look like drugs view that those opposed
[25:52.200 --> 25:57.640]  or without much knowledge will fasten upon to justify their agenda.
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.600]  Yes, sometimes a dab rig can kind of look like you're doing other drugs.
[26:01.600 --> 26:03.400]  I've got this big glass bowl on here.
[26:03.400 --> 26:06.080]  I'm heating it with a torch and then I'm dropping shit into it.
[26:06.080 --> 26:08.760]  It does look a little suspect if you don't know what I'm doing.
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.640]  So I understand your view and I do understand Clint's view on it.
[26:12.640 --> 26:15.640]  Make sure you listen to episode 400 if you want to hear more about that.
[26:15.640 --> 26:16.880]  We're going to keep moving.
[26:16.880 --> 26:17.880]  Where was I?
[26:17.880 --> 26:24.000]  It says, it says, this sort of grown up warts and all approach is what the industry needs
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  more of.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.440]  Then he wraps it up by saying, if necessary, I will set up a GoFundMe page to save white
[26:30.440 --> 26:31.440]  Mike.
[26:31.440 --> 26:32.440]  That's pretty funny.
[26:32.440 --> 26:33.440]  Don't worry.
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.440]  White Mike isn't going anywhere.
[26:34.440 --> 26:35.440]  He's always invited on the show.
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.240]  White Mike is consumed by his family life.
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.360]  He just loves being a dad.
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.640]  He loves being a good husband.
[26:40.640 --> 26:42.400]  So he is always there doing that.
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.040]  I'm sure we'll break him free pretty soon and get him over here on the podcast.
[26:46.040 --> 26:47.560]  No need to save white Mike.
[26:47.560 --> 26:49.320]  However, I'm not going to stop you.
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.040]  If you want to make a GoFundMe page for white Mike, I would not be a good friend if I tried
[26:54.040 --> 26:55.300]  to stop you from doing that.
[26:55.300 --> 26:57.800]  So let's get white Mike a GoFundMe page going.
[26:57.800 --> 26:58.800]  You hear that Mike?
[26:58.800 --> 27:00.400]  You got some money coming, bro.
[27:00.400 --> 27:01.400]  Mike is doing fine.
[27:01.400 --> 27:02.600]  You guys, Mike's not going anywhere.
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.540]  Mike will be on the show pretty soon here.
[27:04.540 --> 27:05.960]  This message continues.
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.600]  Part four says, if either you and or white Mike ever venture over the pond to the UK,
[27:10.600 --> 27:13.080]  then you both have a place to stay.
[27:13.080 --> 27:14.080]  And then he says where?
[27:14.080 --> 27:16.040]  He says, just drop me a line.
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.280]  Then he says, I have had 400 free training lessons from you and you are both welcome
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.800]  to stay at my expense.
[27:21.800 --> 27:23.080]  Hey, that sounds fun.
[27:23.080 --> 27:25.600]  Hey, Mike, let's go overseas and have a good time.
[27:25.600 --> 27:27.080]  Mike was just over there recently.
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.040]  I did not get to join him, but Mike went to France for his birthday.
[27:30.040 --> 27:32.160]  We talked a little bit about that on the show.
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.920]  Part number five says, if you ever want a foreign contributor to your shows, I would
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.440]  be more than happy to contribute.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.920]  Hey, you just did and I appreciate it.
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.280]  He goes on to say that it would be interesting to get a non-US Canadian attitude as to what's
[27:45.280 --> 27:48.920]  happening all over our continent, which I do agree with that.
[27:48.920 --> 27:52.000]  It would be neat to get a little over the pond kind of a report.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.920]  So if you've got some recording equipment, maybe we could work out a little brief segment,
[27:55.920 --> 27:59.920]  maybe occasionally just drop in a little prerecorded part if you're able to do that.
[27:59.920 --> 28:00.920]  Keep in touch with me.
[28:00.920 --> 28:03.040]  I would love to hear your ideas on that.
[28:03.040 --> 28:05.560]  Now he does wrap up the email with, cheers guys.
[28:05.560 --> 28:06.760]  Keep up the good work.
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.760]  Looking to another 400 shows.
[28:09.760 --> 28:12.680]  Then he wraps it up with kind regards from John.
[28:12.680 --> 28:15.660]  Hey, John, thank you for the great message.
[28:15.660 --> 28:18.080]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.200]  And I look forward to bringing you another 400 episodes.
[28:22.200 --> 28:24.360]  All right, podcast world, my voice is burning out.
