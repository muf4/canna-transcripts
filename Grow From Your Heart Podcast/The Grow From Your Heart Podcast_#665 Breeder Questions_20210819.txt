[00:01.600 --> 00:10.760]  All right, here we go.
[00:10.760 --> 00:12.240]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:12.240 --> 00:13.240]  I'm your host.
[00:13.240 --> 00:20.720]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 665 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:20.720 --> 00:24.240]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of emails before we get to that part of the
[00:24.240 --> 00:25.240]  show.
[00:25.240 --> 00:30.160]  Let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the great folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:30.160 --> 00:33.880]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to my friend
[00:33.880 --> 00:35.400]  Girls Grow Too.
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.440]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Pacific Northwest Dan.
[00:38.440 --> 00:41.960]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Canna Organic Illinois.
[00:41.960 --> 00:44.680]  Let's send a big fist bump to my buddy Blackhawks Fan.
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.080]  I want to send a special thank you shout-out to Groove2112.
[00:48.080 --> 00:51.160]  I want to send a big fist bump to my buddy The Canna Crat.
[00:51.160 --> 00:53.980]  Let's send a special thank you shout-out to Lernon and Bernon.
[00:53.980 --> 00:57.200]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Nick A and Frankie.
[00:57.200 --> 00:59.680]  Let's send a big fist bump to Brendan Grows.
[00:59.680 --> 01:03.720]  Then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.200]  to my friends Alex and Adam from Fiskals Organics.
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.200]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.000]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.560]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.120]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and of course I do include a
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.900]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:32.900 --> 01:33.900]  You know the story.
[01:33.900 --> 01:36.820]  If you're driving, if you're trimming, if you've got the kids, don't reach into your
[01:36.820 --> 01:38.260]  pocket and grab your phone now.
[01:38.260 --> 01:40.700]  That link will be there when you're ready.
[01:40.700 --> 01:45.060]  Patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:45.060 --> 01:48.300]  I do again want to invite you to join my Discord server.
[01:48.300 --> 01:52.980]  That's right the Iry Genetics, Iry Army Grow From Your Heart Podcast Discord server has
[01:52.980 --> 01:54.980]  over 1,000 members.
[01:54.980 --> 01:56.900]  It would be great to see you there.
[01:56.900 --> 01:57.900]  Join the party.
[01:57.900 --> 01:58.980]  We do a lot of fun things.
[01:58.980 --> 02:03.700]  There are probably people hanging out right now in the Discord server chatting, talking
[02:03.700 --> 02:08.820]  about growing, talking about life, talking about music, having random conversations.
[02:08.820 --> 02:13.720]  If you've got grow questions, questions about just about anything Iry Genetics, somebody
[02:13.720 --> 02:15.780]  is there to answer that question for you.
[02:15.780 --> 02:19.380]  Even when I am not there, qualified people are there to help you out.
[02:19.380 --> 02:21.940]  That sounds like I got a 1-800 number or something now.
[02:21.940 --> 02:22.980]  That's pretty cool.
[02:22.980 --> 02:25.140]  Join the club, the Iry Genetics Discord.
[02:25.140 --> 02:29.500]  Again, there is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:29.500 --> 02:30.900]  Hang out, join the army.
[02:30.900 --> 02:31.900]  It is a good time.
[02:31.900 --> 02:33.340]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[02:33.340 --> 02:35.060]  I do pop into the live chat occasionally.
[02:35.060 --> 02:36.940]  I've been trying to hang out there more.
[02:36.940 --> 02:38.500]  I keep saying it's got my face on it.
[02:38.500 --> 02:39.980]  I should be more involved.
[02:39.980 --> 02:42.140]  So I do go to the Iry Army Discord.
[02:42.140 --> 02:46.580]  I hang out, take dabs in the live chat, chat with the folks that hang out there, try to
[02:46.580 --> 02:48.740]  be involved, show some appreciation.
[02:48.740 --> 02:50.740]  I do chat in the chat rooms quite a bit.
[02:50.740 --> 02:52.060]  I post pictures.
[02:52.060 --> 02:54.640]  There's a strain specific section now in the Discord.
[02:54.640 --> 02:59.220]  If you want to know anything about any Iry Genetics strain, there is probably a post
[02:59.220 --> 03:00.220]  about it in the Discord.
[03:00.220 --> 03:02.640]  It's got its own strain specific section.
[03:02.640 --> 03:04.960]  If you want to read about a rise, click on a rise.
[03:04.960 --> 03:06.120]  I posted a photo there.
[03:06.120 --> 03:08.400]  A bunch of people have posted grow reports.
[03:08.400 --> 03:10.440]  You can learn a lot on the Discord.
[03:10.440 --> 03:11.680]  Join us.
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.720]  Also, I did post some new merchandise to the web store.
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.960]  Everybody on the Discord and on the Patreon got the first notifications about that new
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.000]  merchandise.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.120]  You're hearing about it here on the podcast.
[03:24.120 --> 03:26.600]  There are some new items in the store.
[03:26.600 --> 03:28.880]  Make sure you check out the Iry Genetics store.
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.420]  Go to irygenetics.com.
[03:31.420 --> 03:32.680]  Click on the store.
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.020]  That will take you right to my web store where you will see the new merchandise.
[03:36.020 --> 03:38.560]  There are several new items you may enjoy.
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.560]  Go take a look.
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.520]  If you're a part of the Patreon or part of the Discord, you got an early notification.
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.920]  So maybe sign up there and you will get early notices when new things are released.
[03:48.920 --> 03:49.920]  All right.
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.880]  That's the main chatter for the top of the show.
[03:51.880 --> 03:53.920]  Let's move our way into the main topics.
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.120]  I did say I was going to talk about some emails.
[03:57.120 --> 03:59.600]  I've got a couple of great emails here in front of me.
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.040]  I don't have them in any particular order.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.960]  Just going to grab one right off the top of the stack.
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.000]  This one comes from our friend Adam, and it goes a lot like this.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.240]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[04:10.240 --> 04:11.720]  I like it when they start off like that.
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.520]  It says, I apologize in advance if this email gets a bit long.
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.680]  It's kind of long, but I will edit it to the best of my ability, and then we will get right
[04:19.680 --> 04:22.200]  to the point in answering a good question.
[04:22.200 --> 04:26.120]  It says, I will try to make sure to keep it as short and to the point as possible.
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.560]  First off, my name is Adam, and if this makes it to the podcast, you can use my name.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.560]  What's up, Adam?
[04:32.560 --> 04:33.560]  Good to meet you.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  I'm Ross to Jeff.
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.560]  Thank you for the great message.
[04:35.560 --> 04:36.560]  It goes on.
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.800]  It says, I listen to a lot of podcasts about growing, and I am a patron to several of them.
[04:41.800 --> 04:44.040]  They, we do all appreciate that.
[04:44.040 --> 04:46.680]  Then it says he's wondering why he doesn't contribute to mine.
[04:46.680 --> 04:48.000]  Yeah, bro, why don't you?
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  Not a big deal.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  I'm doing just fine.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.380]  Keep supporting the shows which you are supporting.
[04:51.560 --> 04:54.260]  There are a lot of people out there supporting me right now.
[04:54.260 --> 04:56.180]  I'm very grateful and appreciative for them.
[04:56.180 --> 04:59.020]  I know that money is expensive, so do what you can.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.180]  I'm getting enough support.
[05:00.180 --> 05:01.940]  There's probably somewhere else.
[05:01.940 --> 05:04.780]  If you're not supporting me and you are supporting somebody, that's fine.
[05:04.780 --> 05:05.780]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[05:05.780 --> 05:06.860]  Somebody else needs your support.
[05:06.860 --> 05:07.860]  That's cool.
[05:07.860 --> 05:08.860]  It goes on.
[05:08.860 --> 05:14.500]  It says, you are the only podcast that I actually trust to teach me something useful, useful
[05:14.500 --> 05:19.940]  advice that I know if I do what you say word for word, I will be successful.
[05:19.980 --> 05:22.820]  Thank you for the amazing, enlightening content.
[05:22.820 --> 05:24.740]  Dude, that's a huge compliment.
[05:24.740 --> 05:27.820]  I don't know if you realize how much of a compliment that is.
[05:27.820 --> 05:34.180]  I do try to keep in mind that you're going to follow my word, hopefully, step by step,
[05:34.180 --> 05:36.220]  word for word, when I give instructions.
[05:36.220 --> 05:40.500]  I forget how much trust you put in me, how much faith you have in me.
[05:40.500 --> 05:44.100]  I try to keep that in mind, but I try also not to let it affect me.
[05:44.100 --> 05:45.300]  I just try to deliver the show.
[05:45.300 --> 05:48.620]  I try not to let it get too stressful and too heavy because it's going to freak me out
[05:48.620 --> 05:49.780]  and mess it all up.
[05:49.780 --> 05:54.260]  I'm glad that you are noticing the attention to detail.
[05:54.260 --> 05:58.220]  I'm glad that you feel that you can just trust me and follow along and that things are going
[05:58.220 --> 06:00.780]  to go right just by following my guidance.
[06:00.780 --> 06:01.860]  I appreciate that, man.
[06:01.860 --> 06:02.860]  Thank you.
[06:02.860 --> 06:05.260]  I'm glad that I'm making your garden better.
[06:05.260 --> 06:06.260]  Excuse the throat clearing.
[06:06.260 --> 06:08.580]  I did take some fat, fat dabs a moment ago.
[06:08.580 --> 06:09.580]  This will go away.
[06:09.580 --> 06:10.580]  All right.
[06:10.580 --> 06:11.580]  I got to keep reading.
[06:11.580 --> 06:12.940]  It says, where were we?
[06:12.940 --> 06:14.380]  It says useful advice.
[06:14.380 --> 06:19.500]  Then it says, that being said, I have a different breeding question for you.
[06:20.220 --> 06:21.980]  We've been talking a lot about breeding on the podcast lately.
[06:21.980 --> 06:24.700]  I've really been enjoying these breeding questions.
[06:24.700 --> 06:27.380]  This one is a fun question for me.
[06:27.380 --> 06:28.380]  It goes on.
[06:28.380 --> 06:31.420]  It says, I've learned enough from you to do my own breeding.
[06:31.420 --> 06:34.900]  I've been making my own seeds for years.
[06:34.900 --> 06:38.020]  I do appreciate that you feel like you've learned enough from me about breeding.
[06:38.020 --> 06:39.780]  I hope you're reading some other books.
[06:39.780 --> 06:42.140]  Read some Mel Frank, some Greg Green.
[06:42.140 --> 06:46.180]  There are lots of other breeding books, a lot of other breeding books that I would recommend
[06:46.180 --> 06:47.180]  you read.
[06:47.180 --> 06:48.640]  Learn about Mendel charts.
[06:48.760 --> 06:50.040]  Read everything from Gregor Mendel.
[06:50.040 --> 06:52.120]  Learn about aliel charts.
[06:52.120 --> 06:53.160]  Learn all of that stuff.
[06:53.160 --> 06:57.040]  Then when it actually comes time to breed, forget you learned all of that and do it all
[06:57.040 --> 06:58.160]  from intuition.
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.320]  But I think it's important to learn all of that.
[07:00.320 --> 07:01.320]  It goes on.
[07:01.320 --> 07:02.680]  There's more.
[07:02.680 --> 07:06.640]  I have been breeding and making my own seeds for years.
[07:06.640 --> 07:11.320]  I've been managed to do pheno hunting, testing, and pollination, which is hard for me to actually
[07:11.320 --> 07:13.320]  express this question I have.
[07:13.320 --> 07:14.320]  Okay.
[07:14.320 --> 07:16.600]  I'm going to do my best to filter out your question.
[07:16.600 --> 07:23.080]  It says, every time I've run across, I don't get a lot of seeds, maybe 50 to a hundred
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.080]  seeds.
[07:24.080 --> 07:25.080]  That's okay.
[07:25.080 --> 07:28.240]  That's enough seeds to work with, to play with, to learn a lot of things about those
[07:28.240 --> 07:29.240]  plants.
[07:29.240 --> 07:33.240]  And you just need possibly bigger plants and better timed pollination, which we can talk
[07:33.240 --> 07:34.920]  about later if you want to.
[07:34.920 --> 07:38.140]  It says, you seem to be a very smart businessman.
[07:38.140 --> 07:44.060]  So I guess my question is, how would one go about starting a seed company?
[07:44.060 --> 07:49.060]  That is a very deep and detailed question that I could talk for days about.
[07:49.060 --> 07:53.140]  So I will touch on that and we'll try to get all of your points here covered.
[07:53.140 --> 07:57.060]  One of the main questions he asks is, how do you keep genetics around?
[07:57.060 --> 08:01.980]  I mean, I don't really care about plant counts, but I have to do pheno hunts and make sure
[08:01.980 --> 08:04.340]  I still have meds to get by.
[08:04.340 --> 08:10.540]  Yeah, that's the hard part is being a breeder, making seeds, and also having enough non-seeded
[08:10.540 --> 08:12.180]  medicine to supply yourself.
[08:12.180 --> 08:17.240]  That's kind of, when I started transitioning from doing seeds to not seeds, that was something
[08:17.240 --> 08:20.280]  I would struggle with.
[08:20.280 --> 08:25.980]  If you're not producing seeds on a commercial level yet, your small grow space, if you make
[08:25.980 --> 08:29.020]  a little bit, it doesn't sound like you're getting a lot of seeds now.
[08:29.020 --> 08:34.440]  If we improve the size of the plants, the pollination times, we can produce many, many
[08:34.440 --> 08:36.500]  more seeds in your grow space.
[08:36.620 --> 08:43.300]  Whatever space you're using for your personal production, we can dedicate one crop per year
[08:43.300 --> 08:49.020]  in that space to make enough seeds for a long time for you to work with and play with, maybe
[08:49.020 --> 08:54.120]  enough to send out some testers to see if what you've developed is, if it qualifies
[08:54.120 --> 08:55.460]  for the market.
[08:55.460 --> 08:57.620]  So you can make a lot of seeds.
[08:57.620 --> 09:01.300]  I would just dedicate one crop to seeds per year if that's what you've got to do.
[09:01.300 --> 09:04.800]  Just go in there and pollinate one time and then clean it all up and then grow a bunch
[09:04.800 --> 09:07.040]  of meds for the rest of the year.
[09:07.040 --> 09:12.720]  Hopefully, then we've got to teach you some tricks to make the other crops fill in the
[09:12.720 --> 09:15.840]  gap for that one crop that you took out for that part of the year.
[09:15.840 --> 09:17.960]  That's probably another good thing to learn.
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.520]  So we've just got to pollinate one crop and then recover for that one crop that you didn't
[09:22.520 --> 09:23.800]  grow for your medicine.
[09:23.800 --> 09:27.200]  It just means we've got to increase production by whatever that one crop is.
[09:27.200 --> 09:30.760]  We've got to cover that by the next four or five crops over the year.
[09:30.760 --> 09:32.580]  You understand what I'm saying.
[09:32.580 --> 09:37.540]  How do I have enough pollinate plants and still have meds to get by?
[09:37.540 --> 09:39.260]  It's all about finding more space.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.740]  You said you don't care about plant counts.
[09:40.740 --> 09:43.260]  So more space, more lights, more plants, dude.
[09:43.260 --> 09:45.180]  But try to keep the best you can.
[09:45.180 --> 09:48.420]  Keep that pollen away from your non-seeded stuff.
[09:48.420 --> 09:52.700]  Just learn how to have veg and flower cycles off of each other, out of rhythm.
[09:52.700 --> 09:56.940]  So you don't have room A in flower while room B is in flowers.
[09:56.940 --> 10:00.660]  You could pollinate, finish up, and then flower the other room right away.
[10:00.660 --> 10:06.020]  Don't have them going and flower at the same time and you won't pollinate both rooms.
[10:06.020 --> 10:08.220]  I do apologize for all the throat clearing in this episode.
[10:08.220 --> 10:09.380]  It is quite distracting.
[10:09.380 --> 10:12.840]  But I'm in a kind of a flow, so we're going to keep going here.
[10:12.840 --> 10:15.620]  One of the other questions, how do you keep genetics around?
[10:15.620 --> 10:18.580]  I keep mother plants, just like a basic mother plant.
[10:18.580 --> 10:20.220]  I do have male and female plants.
[10:20.220 --> 10:22.420]  I've got the King Solomon male plant.
[10:22.420 --> 10:24.900]  I've got the Jack the Ripper male plant that I keep around.
[10:24.900 --> 10:25.900]  Big ups to Subcool.
[10:25.900 --> 10:26.900]  Shout out.
[10:26.900 --> 10:27.900]  Miss you, buddy.
[10:27.900 --> 10:29.060]  Rest in peace, big love.
[10:29.500 --> 10:31.860]  I keep those plants just like a mother plant.
[10:31.860 --> 10:33.060]  They veg perpetually.
[10:33.060 --> 10:38.020]  I keep them in a large pot under a long light time cycle.
[10:38.020 --> 10:40.580]  They stand at a 19-5 cycle, honestly.
[10:40.580 --> 10:43.620]  I keep my moms under 19-5.
[10:43.620 --> 10:46.820]  So they're on for 19 hours a day, off for five hours a day.
[10:46.820 --> 10:50.140]  I keep them under really powerful LED lights right now.
[10:50.140 --> 10:53.620]  Actually, they're under Canon LEDs, big up to Black Sale Market.
[10:53.620 --> 10:54.620]  Check out Black Sale Market.
[10:54.620 --> 10:57.060]  I think you can use coupon code RastaJeff.
[10:57.060 --> 10:58.060]  Might save you a few bucks.
[10:58.060 --> 11:03.060]  Anyway, I keep the mother plants, the father plants just in a perpetual vegetative state.
[11:03.060 --> 11:06.580]  And then when I need them for breeding or whatever I'm going to do in the room, I just
[11:06.580 --> 11:10.140]  cut a bunch of clones and then veg those out and put those in the room together and let
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.140]  them have a party.
[11:11.140 --> 11:12.940]  And that's how the breeding happens.
[11:12.940 --> 11:14.580]  Occasionally, every...
[11:14.580 --> 11:18.220]  Depending on the strain and the plant and the vigor of the plant and how much light
[11:18.220 --> 11:22.060]  that plant needs and how many clones of that plant I take, how frequently.
[11:22.060 --> 11:27.220]  Sometimes I do what I call remomming a plant every three, six, nine months.
[11:27.380 --> 11:30.020]  Like, let's say strawberry starburst.
[11:30.020 --> 11:32.700]  Let's talk about mommying strawberry starburst.
[11:32.700 --> 11:35.440]  That plant grows very fast, very vigorous.
[11:35.440 --> 11:37.460]  It's one of my most productive plants.
[11:37.460 --> 11:42.900]  It needs to be remommed about every three to six months, which means the pot which it
[11:42.900 --> 11:44.740]  is in, it becomes root bound.
[11:44.740 --> 11:48.140]  If I put it in a five or a seven, I don't have room for any bigger than a seven.
[11:48.140 --> 11:51.820]  If I put it in a five or a seven, it will become root bound in three to six months,
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.540]  very tightly root bound.
[11:53.540 --> 11:54.540]  So it gets slow.
[11:54.540 --> 11:55.780]  It stops producing enough shoots.
[11:55.780 --> 11:57.820]  It gets kind of sad and shitty looking.
[11:57.820 --> 12:02.780]  I've got to cut a bunch of clones off of it before it gets to that point, ideally, and
[12:02.780 --> 12:08.180]  then either flower out that old one outdoors or just toss that big one or something and
[12:08.180 --> 12:10.780]  then use all those fresh clones.
[12:10.780 --> 12:14.020]  Part of them will be a production run and then one of them will be kept behind as the
[12:14.020 --> 12:15.660]  new mother.
[12:15.660 --> 12:18.540]  So that one gets remommed every...
[12:18.540 --> 12:21.340]  Probably every four or five months, honestly, about every four months.
[12:21.340 --> 12:23.460]  Let's talk about remomming the mac.
[12:23.460 --> 12:25.580]  The mac veggies quite slowly.
[12:26.380 --> 12:27.740]  It doesn't give me a lot of clones.
[12:27.740 --> 12:32.020]  So I've veged that one in a smaller pot and just let it veg for a really long time.
[12:32.020 --> 12:35.860]  I top it and then I take that top and I make another plant out of it and I let it grow
[12:35.860 --> 12:37.500]  right next to the other one.
[12:37.500 --> 12:40.660]  And then when I need clones, I actually cut clones off of both of those so that I've got
[12:40.660 --> 12:46.300]  enough clones for my project with the mac because I need extra cuts because it doesn't
[12:46.300 --> 12:48.140]  grow very well.
[12:48.140 --> 12:52.180]  But I use two plants as clone donors for that because it doesn't give me a lot of cuts.
[12:52.260 --> 12:57.340]  I don't have to remomm the mac every six months, every eight months, nine months or something
[12:57.340 --> 13:00.140]  like that because the roots don't go too crazy in that plant.
[13:00.140 --> 13:01.740]  It grows very slowly.
[13:01.740 --> 13:04.300]  So I just keep that one aside and let it keep vegging.
[13:04.300 --> 13:05.420]  All the others get up potted.
[13:05.420 --> 13:06.940]  That one doesn't get up potted.
[13:06.940 --> 13:10.660]  I cut a clone off of it, grow it up, cut a clone off of that, grow that one up.
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.580]  So I've got like three or four small mac plants that are growing and I get clones off of all
[13:14.580 --> 13:16.400]  of them when it's time to use them.
[13:16.400 --> 13:17.860]  Keep one behind as the keeper plant.
[13:17.860 --> 13:21.660]  I think I've described keeping mother and father plants properly.
[13:21.660 --> 13:24.940]  I think that is how I keep genetics around.
[13:24.940 --> 13:29.700]  Mother them, father them, perpetually veg them and then when they're getting too big,
[13:29.700 --> 13:31.820]  cut clones off them and start over.
[13:31.820 --> 13:36.180]  A lot of times I try to time it right to where I can go from the three gallon to either the
[13:36.180 --> 13:40.460]  five or the seven, get clones off of it, move that into the flower room and then keep the
[13:40.460 --> 13:43.980]  clones I just cut as my new mother so I can keep it going forever.
[13:43.980 --> 13:49.100]  So I'm vegging using my mom plant as my new flowering plant, get a clone off of that.
[13:49.100 --> 13:50.500]  Kind of keeps it going that way.
[13:50.500 --> 13:51.980]  You'll learn a rhythm of how to do that.
[13:51.980 --> 13:54.700]  All right, so you said you don't really care about plant count.
[13:54.700 --> 13:58.000]  That is fun because the next thing you said is pheno hunts.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.200]  If you're going to start a seed company, you're going to have to search out a lot of things.
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.740]  You've got breeding stuff, right?
[14:04.740 --> 14:05.740]  How do you know it's any good?
[14:05.740 --> 14:08.820]  You need to do some pheno hunts.
[14:08.820 --> 14:11.700]  Run a bunch of those seeds, see what you've got.
[14:11.700 --> 14:13.280]  Pick one or two lines.
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.620]  You said you've read a few things.
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.740]  Pick one or two of your favorites.
[14:16.740 --> 14:18.820]  Run as many of them as you think you can manage.
[14:18.820 --> 14:19.820]  Do them small.
[14:19.820 --> 14:20.820]  They don't need to be big pots.
[14:20.820 --> 14:25.060]  Put them in a one gallon pot, put them in a two gallon pot, veg them until they're just
[14:25.060 --> 14:27.540]  starting to show their shape, what they're going to be shaped like.
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.820]  Then flower them out.
[14:28.820 --> 14:29.860]  Now you know what you've got.
[14:29.860 --> 14:33.180]  You can see if it's crap or if it's amazing or if it's somewhere in the middle.
[14:33.180 --> 14:35.820]  You can see if it's mutants, if it's intersex.
[14:35.820 --> 14:37.420]  You know what you're working with now.
[14:37.420 --> 14:41.100]  Now pick a bunch of those seeds out and package them up and send them out to testers.
[14:41.100 --> 14:42.900]  Let them grow them.
[14:42.900 --> 14:47.540]  Do the testers experience positive or negative results with those seeds.
[14:47.540 --> 14:50.220]  That's how you're going to find out if you've got good stuff.
[14:50.220 --> 14:54.340]  Phenohunting is going to be a fun project, especially when you said you're not worried
[14:54.340 --> 14:56.260]  about plant counts.
[14:56.260 --> 14:59.180]  Get good at identifying the traits you're looking for.
[14:59.180 --> 15:01.460]  Get good at identifying desirable traits.
[15:01.460 --> 15:03.820]  What does the market want?
[15:03.820 --> 15:06.260]  I don't follow trends.
[15:06.260 --> 15:11.460]  Right now everybody wants, and no offense to the market, that's just not where I'm headed.
[15:11.460 --> 15:15.060]  People want cake and dessert flavored stuff right now.
[15:15.060 --> 15:16.460]  That seems to be the trend.
[15:16.460 --> 15:21.820]  I don't do that, but what I do is I watch and see what are they after?
[15:21.820 --> 15:22.820]  Is it bud?
[15:22.820 --> 15:23.940]  What of my stuff works?
[15:23.940 --> 15:25.140]  They want bud density.
[15:25.140 --> 15:26.780]  They want flavor.
[15:26.780 --> 15:27.780]  What is working?
[15:27.780 --> 15:30.020]  Is it powdery mildew resistant?
[15:30.020 --> 15:32.340]  What are the things people are after for their grow right now?
[15:32.340 --> 15:35.300]  Then I just make sure my stuff has those traits.
[15:35.300 --> 15:39.340]  If they like my flavors and aromas, that's what they're going to buy it for.
[15:39.340 --> 15:41.860]  I should get myself back on track and jump back into the message here.
[15:41.860 --> 15:46.160]  It does say, but King Solomon, for example, how do you keep that genetic around for so
[15:46.860 --> 15:47.860]  long?
[15:47.860 --> 15:48.860]  I think I talked a little bit about that.
[15:48.860 --> 15:52.760]  Just keep it as a mother plant, grow it, cut clones off of it, use the clones, put the
[15:52.760 --> 15:56.720]  big one in the room, let him make pollen, then I've got clones kept behind.
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.600]  It says, I had a beautiful arise male that I just collected pollen from, but now he is
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.600]  gone.
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.560]  Yeah, you could have taken clones from him just like you do a female plant and then you
[16:05.560 --> 16:08.640]  would have had him around and then he could have done it again and again and again.
[16:08.640 --> 16:11.760]  Then it goes on to say, I hope you can kind of figure out what I'm asking because I cannot
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.280]  figure out how to put it into words.
[16:14.400 --> 16:17.080]  Thanks for any advice and any response you may give.
[16:17.080 --> 16:22.160]  Thank you again for all of the amazing content you share with the world and of course, happy
[16:22.160 --> 16:23.160]  growing.
[16:23.160 --> 16:24.320]  Hey, my friend Adam, thank you.
[16:24.320 --> 16:27.000]  I do have a few more notes to talk about on this.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.440]  I just wanted to make sure to cover the few questions that you did specifically ask.
[16:32.440 --> 16:33.620]  You want to start a seed company.
[16:33.620 --> 16:38.380]  We talked about how to keep the plants around, how to make a few more seeds.
[16:38.380 --> 16:41.160]  You don't care about plant counts, so pheno hunting is going to be great.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  Get testers out.
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.120]  You still got to produce your own medicine.
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.080]  Just maybe use one room over there for meds and one room over there for seeds and just
[16:50.080 --> 16:52.720]  make sure not to get pollen over there or time them.
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.160]  Just veg this one, flower this one at the right time.
[16:55.160 --> 16:56.360]  You won't pollinate both rooms.
[16:56.360 --> 16:57.360]  I covered that.
[16:57.360 --> 16:59.720]  Now, let's talk about some other stuff.
[16:59.720 --> 17:01.680]  Starting a seed company.
[17:01.680 --> 17:07.460]  My number one question I like to ask people when they have any idea is why.
[17:07.460 --> 17:08.880]  Why do you want to start a seed company?
[17:08.880 --> 17:09.880]  I'm not doubting you.
[17:09.880 --> 17:10.960]  I'm not disrespecting you.
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.640]  I just want you to say out loud to the world why do you want to start a seed company.
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.840]  There doesn't have to be any witnesses around.
[17:18.840 --> 17:20.760]  Nobody needs to be in the room when you say it.
[17:20.760 --> 17:24.160]  I just want you to hear the words come out of your mouth and understand why you want
[17:24.160 --> 17:25.160]  to start a seed company.
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.840]  Have you thought about in depth why?
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.600]  A lot of times when I say why, people go, because ... and they got to actually think
[17:32.600 --> 17:33.600]  about it.
[17:33.600 --> 17:35.920]  They have to take ... We get cool ideas.
[17:35.920 --> 17:37.380]  I want to do a lot of things.
[17:37.380 --> 17:40.840]  I want to go places and I want to see people and buy things.
[17:40.920 --> 17:41.920]  Why?
[17:41.920 --> 17:42.920]  I don't know.
[17:42.920 --> 17:44.520]  Do I just want to because I saw it on the internet?
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.400]  Do I just want to because it sounds like a fun idea or is it something I really want
[17:48.400 --> 17:49.400]  to do?
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.680]  Do I think I want to do it or do I want to do it?
[17:52.680 --> 17:54.360]  Why do you want to start a seed company?
[17:54.360 --> 17:55.360]  What's your goal?
[17:55.360 --> 17:56.360]  What's your purpose?
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.360]  What's your mission?
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.520]  What are you going to bring to the industry, the cannabis industry, the seed industry?
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.920]  What are you going to provide that is not already here?
[18:04.920 --> 18:07.760]  What are you going to do that's not already being done?
[18:07.760 --> 18:10.220]  What can you offer us that's not already being offered?
[18:10.220 --> 18:11.660]  How are you going to stand out?
[18:11.660 --> 18:13.580]  What is your mission, your purpose?
[18:13.580 --> 18:14.580]  What's your pride?
[18:14.580 --> 18:15.700]  Where's your passion?
[18:15.700 --> 18:17.340]  Why are you doing this?
[18:17.340 --> 18:18.340]  What's your purpose?
[18:18.340 --> 18:19.940]  All right, so that's my main question.
[18:19.940 --> 18:25.420]  All right, another note that I wrote down was to not learn how to be a seed breeder
[18:25.420 --> 18:27.460]  while you're starting a company.
[18:27.460 --> 18:28.660]  Learn seed breeding.
[18:28.660 --> 18:31.140]  Learn the ins and outs of seed breeding.
[18:31.140 --> 18:34.180]  Learn the basics before you launch your company.
[18:34.180 --> 18:38.300]  If you put your brand and your logo on some stuff and you send out some stuff before you're
[18:38.300 --> 18:42.540]  ready and you realize, I don't know all of the ins and outs and I haven't thought this
[18:42.540 --> 18:47.580]  through yet, and you send out some problematic seeds or your shipping isn't on time or things
[18:47.580 --> 18:51.740]  go wrong and you start off wrong, you won't get far in this industry.
[18:51.740 --> 18:57.020]  The cannabis industry, the seed breeding industry, the growers, the patients, they're all on
[18:57.020 --> 18:58.020]  the internet.
[18:58.020 --> 19:00.140]  They all have a very tight knit community.
[19:00.140 --> 19:01.760]  Everybody knows everybody.
[19:01.760 --> 19:04.160]  Every brand gets a very quick reputation.
[19:04.160 --> 19:08.480]  If you kind of suck at the beginning, the community is going to say, hey, this new seed
[19:08.480 --> 19:10.320]  company, they failed at the very beginning.
[19:10.320 --> 19:11.320]  They didn't do me right.
[19:11.320 --> 19:12.320]  They didn't treat me right.
[19:12.320 --> 19:13.680]  Their product wasn't good.
[19:13.680 --> 19:15.000]  It didn't work for me.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.720]  You'll never get very far after that because word spreads like wildfire.
[19:18.720 --> 19:22.800]  This industry, we do take people's word for a lot of what we're doing.
[19:22.800 --> 19:26.660]  We use a lot of recommendations and a lot of reviews from the internet.
[19:26.660 --> 19:28.120]  That's going to matter a lot.
[19:28.120 --> 19:30.200]  Don't learn on your customers.
[19:30.200 --> 19:31.200]  Get established.
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.040]  Learn what you're doing, then get a customer base.
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.100]  That's going to go a long way for you because I see a lot of breeders on social media doing
[19:39.100 --> 19:40.100]  it backwards.
[19:40.100 --> 19:43.680]  They're making seeds and trying to figure it out and using their customers as their
[19:43.680 --> 19:47.100]  tester base and as their education.
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.100]  Don't do that.
[19:48.100 --> 19:52.240]  Educate yourself, then sell seeds to your customers and they'll be much more happy with
[19:52.240 --> 19:53.240]  you.
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.960]  You'll feel more pride and then you'll stick around and they'll come back and buy more
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.960]  seeds.
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.400]  I've got a lot of stuff on my paper here.
[20:00.440 --> 20:07.480]  If you're going to start a seed company, something I was going to say, consumers are very educated.
[20:07.480 --> 20:11.640]  Consumers are very connected and they are not afraid to go on the internet and either
[20:11.640 --> 20:13.660]  give you big praise.
[20:13.660 --> 20:17.880]  You can see like you said here, Rastajef, you did amazingly.
[20:17.880 --> 20:20.720]  There's also the opposite if you don't do well.
[20:20.720 --> 20:23.240]  The great thing about the internet, if you do a good job, you'll get one email.
[20:23.240 --> 20:25.800]  If you do a bad job, you'll get about 100 of them.
[20:25.800 --> 20:29.920]  If you mess up, you're going to get lit up really quickly.
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.480]  The consumers are very, very educated right now.
[20:33.480 --> 20:34.640]  They could listen to my show.
[20:34.640 --> 20:36.160]  They could listen to the Dude Grow Show.
[20:36.160 --> 20:37.340]  They could listen to Adam Dunn.
[20:37.340 --> 20:39.360]  They could listen to Tad Hussey.
[20:39.360 --> 20:41.160]  They could listen to Danny Danko and Mike.
[20:41.160 --> 20:46.200]  They could listen to so many shows out there to become very educated consumers.
[20:46.200 --> 20:47.620]  Then they all go online.
[20:47.620 --> 20:48.820]  They join my Discord.
[20:48.820 --> 20:51.020]  They join everybody's Discord.
[20:51.020 --> 20:54.080]  Every breeder out there by now probably has a cool Discord.
[20:54.080 --> 20:56.120]  They all go get very, very educated.
[20:56.120 --> 20:57.720]  They talk amongst each other.
[20:57.720 --> 20:58.960]  We love teaching each other.
[20:58.960 --> 21:00.560]  We're all very passionate.
[21:00.560 --> 21:02.760]  The consumers are very educated right now.
[21:02.760 --> 21:06.320]  If you make some mistakes, they will see through it and they'll call you out.
[21:06.320 --> 21:07.720]  They'll point it out.
[21:07.720 --> 21:11.680]  They'll expose you is what the internet likes to say now.
[21:11.680 --> 21:14.000]  Do what you're going to do, but do it correctly.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.600]  Come correct is what I think they say now because the consumers are very educated.
[21:18.600 --> 21:24.400]  If you are going to start a seed company from somebody who has been in it for a while,
[21:24.400 --> 21:27.440]  who is deep in it now, this is my life, dude.
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.920]  There's no way out and that's cool.
[21:28.920 --> 21:29.920]  I am dedicated.
[21:29.920 --> 21:31.200]  This is what I wanted.
[21:31.200 --> 21:36.120]  I didn't know this is what I was starting when I started it, but this is what I want.
[21:36.120 --> 21:38.740]  There's no halfway in if you're starting a seed company.
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.640]  If you're all in, you're all in.
[21:40.640 --> 21:43.940]  If you're not all in, you know it and don't even start.
[21:43.940 --> 21:48.360]  If you've got a backup plan, if you say, I'm going to start this seed company, but if it
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.320]  fails, you're already not in it.
[21:51.320 --> 21:54.320]  You've got to say, I'm going to start this seed company and then I'm going to do this
[21:54.320 --> 21:57.760]  with the seed company and then in five years I'll do this.
[21:57.760 --> 21:59.640]  Then in 10 years I'll do this.
[21:59.640 --> 22:01.400]  Then we'll expand to this.
[22:01.400 --> 22:04.620]  If that's your thought process, you've got a chance of winning.
[22:04.620 --> 22:09.640]  If you've got a backup plan already, if you've got an exit strategy, you are not meant to
[22:09.640 --> 22:11.100]  be in the seed game.
[22:11.100 --> 22:13.200]  This is a huge commitment.
[22:13.200 --> 22:14.920]  This is a huge lifestyle.
[22:14.920 --> 22:16.160]  This isn't just a business.
[22:16.240 --> 22:19.280]  This isn't just work.
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.760]  This is my lifestyle.
[22:20.760 --> 22:23.120]  I have to wake up and take care of plants.
[22:23.120 --> 22:25.600]  Before I go to bed, I am checking on plants.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.680]  I spend the first part of my day answering emails.
[22:28.680 --> 22:29.920]  I know people are going, no, he doesn't.
[22:29.920 --> 22:30.920]  He doesn't reply to me.
[22:30.920 --> 22:31.920]  Dude, I try.
[22:31.920 --> 22:33.360]  I get a lot of emails.
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.720]  There's social media to be done.
[22:34.720 --> 22:36.080]  There's merchandise to be ordered.
[22:36.080 --> 22:38.160]  There's packaging to be ordered.
[22:38.160 --> 22:41.160]  Once the packaging gets here, you've got to put the seeds in the packaging.
[22:41.160 --> 22:43.200]  You've got to put the labels on the packaging.
[22:43.200 --> 22:45.240]  I do all of that stuff.
[22:45.320 --> 22:47.400]  I do get some help with some of the things.
[22:47.400 --> 22:50.640]  I like to do all the seed touching and stuff myself.
[22:50.640 --> 22:55.080]  Some of the other stuff I do let some people help with, but 99% of it is me.
[22:55.080 --> 22:56.080]  There's a web guide.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.080]  There's an accounting team.
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.080]  There's stuff.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.280]  Oh, then you've got to go talk to the lawyers.
[22:59.280 --> 23:00.520]  You've got to go talk to the accountants.
[23:00.520 --> 23:02.600]  You've got to go do bank stuff.
[23:02.600 --> 23:04.320]  There's so much being involved.
[23:04.320 --> 23:07.040]  If you want to do this, be all in.
[23:07.040 --> 23:11.400]  It will be stressful in so many ways, but it's rewarding in so many ways.
[23:11.400 --> 23:13.560]  I wake up and I don't have to answer to a boss.
[23:13.600 --> 23:15.360]  The boss is myself and the most I am.
[23:15.360 --> 23:16.840]  I'm okay with that.
[23:16.840 --> 23:18.040]  That's what I want for my life.
[23:18.040 --> 23:19.680]  There's nobody bitching at me.
[23:19.680 --> 23:20.720]  Nobody telling me I'm late.
[23:20.720 --> 23:23.400]  Nobody telling me that I suck, that I got to work harder.
[23:23.400 --> 23:24.400]  Only me.
[23:24.400 --> 23:27.520]  I'm the only one that says that to me and that's okay.
[23:27.520 --> 23:28.960]  But it's a lifestyle.
[23:28.960 --> 23:34.620]  It's a strain on relationships because when you own a business, it's hard to decide when
[23:34.620 --> 23:35.640]  to take a day off.
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.560]  You guys don't even want to know what time it is right now when I'm recording.
[23:38.560 --> 23:39.560]  It's dark as shit out.
[23:39.560 --> 23:41.400]  I'm the only one up in the neighborhood.
[23:41.400 --> 23:45.720]  Nobody can probably hear me talking right now, but that is entrepreneur life.
[23:45.720 --> 23:48.800]  If you're going to start a seed company, you become an entrepreneur.
[23:48.800 --> 23:49.800]  You're breeding.
[23:49.800 --> 23:50.800]  You're taking care of the garden.
[23:50.800 --> 23:52.200]  You're taking care of the seeds.
[23:52.200 --> 23:53.200]  Then you're marketing.
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.600]  You're getting merchandise.
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.880]  You're meeting with people.
[23:55.880 --> 23:57.080]  You're worried about security.
[23:57.080 --> 23:59.420]  You're worried about financial things.
[23:59.420 --> 24:00.420]  Then you're marketing again.
[24:00.420 --> 24:01.420]  Then there's social media.
[24:01.420 --> 24:03.920]  Then you got to get up and do it all again tomorrow.
[24:03.920 --> 24:04.920]  When do you take a break?
[24:04.920 --> 24:06.440]  It's going to put a strain on relationships.
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.920]  It's going to put a strain on a lot of things.
[24:07.920 --> 24:10.540]  You have to learn a lot of balance.
[24:10.940 --> 24:14.860]  If you love it like I do, it's very, very rewarding.
[24:14.860 --> 24:19.420]  I think that the interactions I've built with my audience, the Iry Army, the Grow From Your
[24:19.420 --> 24:22.940]  Heart crew, that is very rewarding.
[24:22.940 --> 24:26.240]  That refills all of the stress that this company gives me.
[24:26.240 --> 24:28.140]  It's not even that stressful.
[24:28.140 --> 24:30.380]  It could be so much more stressful.
[24:30.380 --> 24:35.180]  The things I have to handle, the army, the crew replenish me.
[24:35.180 --> 24:36.300]  I go hang out in the chat.
[24:36.300 --> 24:41.140]  I hang out on Monday and you guys give me praise and send me digital fist bumps.
[24:41.140 --> 24:42.660]  That stuff really does recharge me.
[24:42.660 --> 24:46.420]  Of course, the Patreon and the seed sales, they do feel good as well.
[24:46.420 --> 24:49.680]  All that stuff from the crowd, the army, does recharge me.
[24:49.680 --> 24:51.120]  There is a lot of work to be done.
[24:51.120 --> 24:53.540]  It's going to put a strain on your life, your relationships.
[24:53.540 --> 24:55.380]  Don't let it affect your health.
[24:55.380 --> 24:56.580]  Learn some balance.
[24:56.580 --> 24:58.820]  If you've got an exit strategy, you're not in.
[24:58.820 --> 25:03.180]  You got to be all in because this is an all in thing.
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.780]  It's getting very competitive.
[25:05.820 --> 25:08.300]  Every year it gets more competitive.
[25:08.300 --> 25:11.980]  Speaking of every year, I didn't think about going to events.
[25:11.980 --> 25:15.540]  Once you've started a seed brand, where are you going to sell your seeds?
[25:15.540 --> 25:16.900]  It's great to sell them on the internet.
[25:16.900 --> 25:18.420]  That feels really nice.
[25:18.420 --> 25:22.360]  The key is to go to the places and meet the people and shake their hands.
[25:22.360 --> 25:23.860]  That's where you build relationships.
[25:23.860 --> 25:26.900]  That's where you build long lasting clientele.
[25:26.900 --> 25:31.060]  Some of my favorite people I meet at the events, they stand in front of my booth and wait 30
[25:31.060 --> 25:33.380]  minutes to get in line to see me and shake my hand.
[25:33.380 --> 25:35.500]  When they get there, I take my time with them.
[25:36.220 --> 25:37.220]  I shake their hand.
[25:37.220 --> 25:40.060]  I look them in the eye and I'm like, bro, I saw the pictures of the last girl you did.
[25:40.060 --> 25:41.460]  It looked amazing.
[25:41.460 --> 25:43.940]  Your new baby is beautiful.
[25:43.940 --> 25:46.100]  Conversations like that, you know who you are bro and ma'am.
[25:46.100 --> 25:51.380]  I like to meet the people, shake their hands, give them hugs, high five them, take pictures
[25:51.380 --> 25:52.380]  with them.
[25:52.380 --> 25:54.820]  That's a huge, huge part of being a seed breeder.
[25:54.820 --> 25:55.820]  You got to build a booth.
[25:55.820 --> 25:58.740]  You have to build a team that can work the booth with you.
[25:58.740 --> 26:02.620]  Then while you're at the booth at the Endo Expo for the weekend, who's taking care of
[26:02.620 --> 26:03.620]  the garden at home?
[26:03.620 --> 26:04.620]  Who's taking care of the seeds?
[26:04.740 --> 26:07.420]  Who's taking care of the internet, the website, the orders?
[26:07.420 --> 26:12.220]  There are a lot of things to think about logistics to deal with when it comes to owning a legitimate
[26:12.220 --> 26:13.860]  seed company.
[26:13.860 --> 26:18.220]  But if you build a nice team and you got some support, it is very easy.
[26:18.220 --> 26:20.340]  The market is getting more competitive.
[26:20.340 --> 26:24.420]  The market is getting much more competitive and more fast pace.
[26:24.420 --> 26:30.980]  All of the websites where I vend, if they had 10 breeders when I started, now they've
[26:30.980 --> 26:32.060]  got 30.
[26:32.060 --> 26:35.100]  If they had 20 when I started, now they've got 100.
[26:35.100 --> 26:37.700]  These websites are building quickly.
[26:37.700 --> 26:39.500]  Of course, I'm expanding to more vendors.
[26:39.500 --> 26:44.220]  I've got more outlets, but every website I go to, they've got more and more breeders,
[26:44.220 --> 26:48.500]  which is more competition, which means that you've got to do what I said earlier.
[26:48.500 --> 26:49.500]  How do you stand out?
[26:49.500 --> 26:50.500]  How do you set apart?
[26:50.500 --> 26:51.500]  What makes you special?
[26:51.500 --> 26:53.320]  Why do I want to buy your seeds?
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.140]  Why would I pick your brand over the 700 other brands that are available on the market right
[26:58.140 --> 26:59.140]  now?
[26:59.140 --> 27:00.380]  So you're going to have to come up somehow.
[27:00.380 --> 27:01.580]  You're going to have to stand out.
[27:02.100 --> 27:05.060]  You're going to have to win some awards or put out a strain that gets noticed.
[27:05.060 --> 27:07.700]  If you want longevity, do something real.
[27:07.700 --> 27:12.540]  Don't just use some shitty sales tactics that a lot of other brands that came and went tried
[27:12.540 --> 27:13.540]  to use.
[27:13.540 --> 27:15.140]  All right, there's more.
[27:15.140 --> 27:16.140]  There is more.
[27:16.140 --> 27:17.140]  No backup plan.
[27:17.140 --> 27:18.140]  That's what I've got written.
[27:18.140 --> 27:21.180]  If you've got a backup plan, you're not in it to win it.
[27:21.180 --> 27:25.460]  One of the things I struggled with, and I keep kind of mentioning this, letting others
[27:25.460 --> 27:28.420]  help with my company is really hard for me.
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.980]  I do have a web guy because I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to building a
[27:31.980 --> 27:32.980]  website.
[27:32.980 --> 27:34.100]  I rely on him and trust him greatly.
[27:34.100 --> 27:36.060]  I've got a graphic design group.
[27:36.060 --> 27:38.820]  I've got a few people that do graphic designs for me.
[27:38.820 --> 27:40.100]  They've learned my style.
[27:40.100 --> 27:45.580]  I got one guy I can say, hey bro, I want to make a sticker for a strain called blue raspberry
[27:45.580 --> 27:46.580]  truffle.
[27:46.580 --> 27:47.580]  And he goes, say no more, fam.
[27:47.580 --> 27:49.940]  And 30 minutes later, I get a design for blue raspberry truffle.
[27:49.940 --> 27:51.220]  And it's what I was thinking.
[27:51.220 --> 27:53.580]  I didn't have to send him my image or my idea.
[27:53.580 --> 27:55.340]  He goes, I already know what you're going to do, bro.
[27:55.340 --> 27:56.340]  Here you go.
[27:56.340 --> 27:57.340]  And he just sends it and it's perfect.
[27:57.340 --> 27:58.780]  So shout out to Kevin.
[27:58.780 --> 28:00.460]  You know who you are, bro.
[28:00.460 --> 28:01.740]  He hooks me up with great art.
[28:01.740 --> 28:02.740]  I do stuff like that.
[28:02.740 --> 28:04.820]  I let people help me out with stuff like that.
[28:04.820 --> 28:10.420]  But letting people design some of the merch and do some of that kind of stuff, it took
[28:10.420 --> 28:12.860]  me a minute to let go of some of that control.
[28:12.860 --> 28:16.020]  I still don't let anybody package seeds.
[28:16.020 --> 28:19.020]  Every seed is packaged by hand by me.
[28:19.020 --> 28:23.140]  They come in a little round disc with a little foam protective insert.
[28:23.140 --> 28:26.260]  All of the seeds come out of a little, it's a ritual.
[28:26.260 --> 28:30.460]  They get put into a little, like a, just a cereal bowl, a small cereal bowl.
[28:30.460 --> 28:34.220]  I roll them on the bottom of the bowl to make sure they're nice and hard with this finger.
[28:34.220 --> 28:36.100]  I make sure the seed's nice and solid.
[28:36.100 --> 28:37.980]  I set a few of them at the edge of the bowl.
[28:37.980 --> 28:41.500]  And then I try to find 10 or 12 of them that look like they would be friends to go in a
[28:41.500 --> 28:43.100]  container together.
[28:43.100 --> 28:46.860]  Maybe that's crazy, but I package every seed by myself.
[28:46.860 --> 28:50.300]  They're iRegenetics hand selected premium seeds.
[28:50.300 --> 28:53.060]  And I think that doing that, it says it on the package.
[28:53.060 --> 28:54.060]  That's what I talk about.
[28:54.060 --> 28:55.300]  I need to follow that.
[28:55.340 --> 28:58.940]  And that's why I stand out, because I touched those seeds and I made sure that they're quality.
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.860]  I don't trust anybody else to do that.
[29:01.860 --> 29:07.660]  Learning to delegate and letting anybody do anything else with my company took a long
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.660]  time.
[29:08.660 --> 29:13.300]  It took a very long time until I realized I simply cannot do all of this stuff.
[29:13.300 --> 29:17.060]  If I want to give you a long talkative podcast like this, I've been going for quite a while
[29:17.060 --> 29:18.340]  today and I'm enjoying it.
[29:18.340 --> 29:20.340]  I want to give you long shows like this.
[29:20.340 --> 29:23.300]  I've got to learn how to let other people help me with other things.
[29:23.340 --> 29:25.260]  So shout out to guys like Dave.
[29:25.260 --> 29:27.540]  Dave does Waffles and Actions.
[29:27.540 --> 29:30.380]  If you're on the internet, you know what Waffles and Actions are.
[29:30.380 --> 29:32.220]  Shout out to the artist crew.
[29:32.220 --> 29:35.700]  Shout out to Handmade Apparel, Adam Hand, for making shirts for me.
[29:35.700 --> 29:37.940]  Shout out to Kevin for doing artwork.
[29:37.940 --> 29:39.380]  There are other people.
[29:39.380 --> 29:41.460]  Black Thumb Grower gets a shout out too.
[29:41.460 --> 29:42.940]  But those people help me out quite a bit.
[29:42.940 --> 29:44.660]  I feel like there was somebody I really wanted to give a shout out.
[29:44.660 --> 29:48.580]  I was going to give a shout out to DP710 for his blueberry butcher artwork.
[29:48.580 --> 29:52.460]  You guys will see stickers and shirts of that when the seeds are restocked.
[29:52.500 --> 29:55.940]  Shout out to Dave for helping design some merchandise.
[29:55.940 --> 29:57.740]  Shout out to all the people that helped me out.
[29:57.740 --> 30:01.540]  Shout out to Riven Waters for a bunch of great artwork as well.
[30:01.540 --> 30:04.540]  Those people make my life much easier.
[30:04.540 --> 30:06.140]  A lot of people have sent me great artwork.
[30:06.140 --> 30:06.740]  Now I'm in a hole.
[30:06.740 --> 30:07.740]  I can't remember everybody.
[30:07.740 --> 30:11.300]  But all those people that sent me artwork and things like that that helped me out,
[30:11.300 --> 30:12.540]  they do make my life easier.
[30:12.540 --> 30:17.420]  It was hard, hard, hard, hard to let people have a little bit of control in this company
[30:17.420 --> 30:18.260]  because it was my vision.
[30:18.260 --> 30:19.340]  It's my baby.
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.980]  So learn how to delegate.
[30:20.980 --> 30:23.180]  Learn what you're comfortable letting other people do.
[30:23.180 --> 30:27.380]  So once the seeds go into the container and that part is sealed up, sometimes I do let
[30:27.380 --> 30:31.340]  other people fold the card and put a sticker on it and put that into a baggie and heat
[30:31.340 --> 30:32.380]  seal it.
[30:32.380 --> 30:36.140]  But that's like the only part I really let other people do for me because that's kind
[30:36.140 --> 30:41.300]  of, I can watch them do it and I give them 100 packs, 100 bubbles with 100 cards and
[30:41.300 --> 30:43.660]  100 stickers and they kind of can't screw it up.
[30:43.660 --> 30:45.260]  They kind of have to try to fuck that up.
[30:45.260 --> 30:48.700]  So I do let other people do that part sometimes.
[30:48.900 --> 30:52.780]  But most of the time, it's just me doing the seed packaging.
[30:52.780 --> 30:55.740]  So learning to let other people help is a challenge.
[30:55.740 --> 30:58.260]  Know when to ask for help.
[30:58.260 --> 31:00.740]  So then you've got to just do it, man.
[31:00.740 --> 31:05.060]  Just do it and then learn how to adjust and adapt to the market.
[31:05.060 --> 31:06.060]  Things are going to happen.
[31:06.060 --> 31:07.180]  Things are going to go wrong.
[31:07.180 --> 31:09.260]  Things won't go as expected.
[31:09.260 --> 31:13.180]  I've been booked for events and had the car loaded up and was about to get in the car
[31:13.180 --> 31:17.100]  and then got an email or a text message saying, hey, they just came and said you can't sell
[31:17.100 --> 31:18.100]  seeds here.
[31:18.500 --> 31:21.980]  I'm like, well, I paid you a lot of money for that booth and I'd like to go sell seeds
[31:21.980 --> 31:22.980]  there.
[31:22.980 --> 31:23.980]  And they're like, no, you can't even sell seeds.
[31:23.980 --> 31:25.260]  I wouldn't even show up if I were you.
[31:25.260 --> 31:29.140]  I'll give you back your money or you might not even get your money back.
[31:29.140 --> 31:31.340]  Those are often options at events.
[31:31.340 --> 31:33.940]  So learn to adjust and adapt.
[31:33.940 --> 31:36.740]  Recently, my Instagram page got fucking taken.
[31:36.740 --> 31:38.180]  Luckily, I've got a good team.
[31:38.180 --> 31:39.660]  We got that back quite quickly.
[31:39.660 --> 31:41.500]  But that's a great marketing tool.
[31:41.500 --> 31:44.780]  And without that, I was not reaching over 30,000 people.
[31:44.780 --> 31:48.980]  I posted over 500 people would see my stories every time I post them.
[31:48.980 --> 31:53.140]  That was 500 people that were not seeing my content potential.
[31:53.140 --> 31:55.540]  Those are we call those leads in the business industry.
[31:55.540 --> 31:57.860]  So it took a minute to get the Instagram back.
[31:57.860 --> 32:00.660]  There's always going to be stepping stones and stuff like that.
[32:00.660 --> 32:02.660]  Learn to adjust and adapt.
[32:02.660 --> 32:05.540]  Shit's not going to go smoothly for the first two years.
[32:05.540 --> 32:08.420]  And then you're going to get busy and it's going to feel like you're never going to catch
[32:08.420 --> 32:09.660]  up, which is a good thing.
[32:09.660 --> 32:12.780]  If you feel like you're catching up in a business, that means you don't have enough to do.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.780]  It means you're failing.
[32:13.860 --> 32:16.260]  You got to find more shit to do.
[32:16.260 --> 32:17.820]  So I'm rambling on that.
[32:17.820 --> 32:18.820]  Let's see.
[32:18.820 --> 32:22.380]  Then there's marketing, networking, and being involved.
[32:22.380 --> 32:23.700]  You've got to market your brand.
[32:23.700 --> 32:26.060]  How are people going to know that you exist?
[32:26.060 --> 32:30.020]  Social media will get you so far, but then you've got to get out there, be seen, make
[32:30.020 --> 32:34.420]  flyers, merchandise stickers, be on shows, get known.
[32:34.420 --> 32:36.620]  Networking.
[32:36.620 --> 32:39.820]  When you're new, I'm not trying to...
[32:39.820 --> 32:45.180]  It's hard to afford a booth and advertising and all of the requirements to get up where
[32:45.180 --> 32:46.780]  you need to be as a new breeder.
[32:46.780 --> 32:48.900]  So networking will help you out.
[32:48.900 --> 32:53.460]  Maybe you'll make friends with myself or another breeder who is new to the game.
[32:53.460 --> 32:57.460]  Maybe I'll say, hey bro, I'll give you two hours at my booth on Sunday.
[32:57.460 --> 33:01.180]  If you want to come hang out at my booth on Sunday, I'll give you two hours where you
[33:01.180 --> 33:03.000]  can come set up shop at my booth.
[33:03.000 --> 33:07.580]  You can tweet and say, hey, my brand will be at iRegenetics' booth at the Indo Expo
[33:07.580 --> 33:08.780]  for two hours.
[33:08.780 --> 33:10.940]  You can sit next to me and sell seeds for two hours.
[33:10.940 --> 33:12.220]  I'll give you a chance like that.
[33:12.220 --> 33:15.260]  So do some networking and make some friends.
[33:15.260 --> 33:19.280]  Or find another breeder who is right at your level and split the booth with them or maybe
[33:19.280 --> 33:24.860]  two or three other breeders and get like four or five other breeders who are just entering
[33:24.860 --> 33:25.860]  the game.
[33:25.860 --> 33:27.400]  All of you can go and network together.
[33:27.400 --> 33:30.420]  You can all use your social media powers together.
[33:30.420 --> 33:31.420]  Power in numbers.
[33:31.420 --> 33:33.040]  More people will come to the booth.
[33:33.040 --> 33:36.020]  Then when somebody comes to the booth to buy your friend's seeds, they'll say, oh, you
[33:36.020 --> 33:37.660]  made a cross of that and that.
[33:37.660 --> 33:39.140]  I want those seeds also.
[33:39.140 --> 33:42.380]  Now you've made a new client, a new customer, a new lead.
[33:42.380 --> 33:44.980]  Then you cross advertise with each other like that.
[33:44.980 --> 33:47.180]  I don't feel competition in the breeding game.
[33:47.180 --> 33:50.340]  So I'm all about teaching my friends how to get into this and helping you do it.
[33:50.340 --> 33:56.180]  Just know it's oversaturated and a lot of us are, it's already taken up.
[33:56.180 --> 33:58.220]  The pie is already getting eaten up.
[33:58.220 --> 34:03.460]  But I'm not afraid to teach you guys how to get into it because I feel it's like food
[34:03.460 --> 34:04.460]  and music.
[34:04.460 --> 34:08.460]  I make a certain kind of thing and you might not be into my certain kind of thing and that
[34:08.460 --> 34:12.140]  is okay with me because there are plenty of people that are into it.
[34:12.140 --> 34:18.140]  I'm into fish, the band Fish, and I'm into the Grateful Dead and I love reggae music.
[34:18.140 --> 34:22.200]  That's my little box, my genre of stuff I really, really enjoy.
[34:22.200 --> 34:26.380]  So let's just hypothetically say that my seeds are that kind of music.
[34:26.380 --> 34:30.740]  We'll say I put out Fish and reggae and Grateful Dead vibes with my seeds.
[34:30.740 --> 34:35.260]  If you've got Norwegian death metal seeds, that's not going to be my favorite.
[34:35.260 --> 34:36.260]  I'm not against it.
[34:36.260 --> 34:37.500]  I got no problem with it.
[34:37.500 --> 34:39.260]  That's just not my favorite.
[34:39.260 --> 34:43.980]  But there's going to be somebody at the convention that is looking and has been looking their
[34:43.980 --> 34:47.300]  whole life for Norwegian death metal seeds.
[34:47.300 --> 34:48.500]  Maybe you're into country music.
[34:48.500 --> 34:52.460]  There's a breeder that breeds seeds that are aimed toward the country music vibe.
[34:52.460 --> 34:55.820]  Just being, just giving you analogies here trying to compare some shit.
[34:56.060 --> 35:01.460]  I don't feel any competition because I make a certain type of product and other breeders
[35:01.460 --> 35:03.820]  out there make a certain type of product.
[35:03.820 --> 35:08.420]  A lot of the times people in the community have already decided what they're into.
[35:08.420 --> 35:11.960]  If you're into a certain thing, like if a lot of people have already decided when they
[35:11.960 --> 35:16.660]  go to the event, I want to go find Mr. Soul or I want to go find I Read Genetics or I
[35:16.660 --> 35:18.220]  want to go find Capulator.
[35:18.220 --> 35:19.820]  Everybody goes and gets in Caps Line.
[35:19.820 --> 35:22.660]  So we already know, we've already kind of found the band that we're looking for.
[35:22.660 --> 35:25.260]  It's like when you go to the festival, can't wait for six o'clock.
[35:25.260 --> 35:28.820]  I got to go see Fish at the Main Stage or whatever band you're into.
[35:28.820 --> 35:29.820]  You already know it.
[35:29.820 --> 35:30.820]  The industry gets like that.
[35:30.820 --> 35:35.980]  I feel no competition, no weird vibes or anything like that toward any of the industry.
[35:35.980 --> 35:37.700]  So I think I covered most of my notes.
[35:37.700 --> 35:39.020]  I did write a lot of stuff down.
[35:39.020 --> 35:40.380]  That was a really good question.
[35:40.380 --> 35:43.300]  Got me really, really rambly, which I do enjoy.
[35:43.300 --> 35:47.980]  I do need a drink and I do think that I'm going to wrap up this episode because my next
[35:47.980 --> 35:50.260]  question is going to be a long one.
[35:50.260 --> 35:54.660]  So on the next episode, we're going to have another long question that talks about commercial
[35:54.660 --> 35:59.220]  cultivation, cover a couple of commercial cultivations in the next episode.
[35:59.220 --> 36:00.300]  My buddy Adam, thank you.
[36:00.300 --> 36:01.300]  That was a great question, dude.
[36:01.300 --> 36:03.460]  You got me talking for quite a long time.
[36:03.460 --> 36:05.660]  Not a lot of editing to do, which makes my life easy.
[36:05.660 --> 36:07.460]  So thanks again for that.
[36:07.460 --> 36:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[36:12.060 --> 36:18.180]  cutters, pollen chuckers, BMX riders, skateboarders, surfer kids, and fruit booters, I want to
[36:18.180 --> 36:23.540]  thank each and every one of you again for listening to episode 665 of the Grow From
[36:23.540 --> 36:25.100]  Your Heart podcast.
[36:25.100 --> 36:28.980]  Every time I read the episode numbers on my screen, it makes me make this weird smile.
[36:28.980 --> 36:30.540]  It's kind of a weird pride thing.
[36:30.540 --> 36:34.780]  It's also like, holy shit, we did 665 episodes.
[36:34.780 --> 36:35.780]  It's pride.
[36:35.780 --> 36:36.780]  It's also a giddy feeling.
[36:36.780 --> 36:39.260]  Couldn't have done it, wouldn't have done it without you.
[36:39.260 --> 36:41.660]  So thank you guys for watching, listening, supporting.
[36:41.660 --> 36:43.460]  I do appreciate it.
[36:43.460 --> 36:46.780]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[36:46.780 --> 36:47.780]  from you.
[36:48.380 --> 36:51.580]  My email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[36:51.580 --> 36:52.580]  Don't be shy.
[36:52.580 --> 36:53.580]  Send me some messages.
[36:53.580 --> 36:54.580]  Let me know what's up.
[36:54.580 --> 36:55.580]  Also, the Discord.
[36:55.580 --> 36:57.860]  I mentioned the Discord earlier in the show.
[36:57.860 --> 36:58.940]  The Discord server.
[36:58.940 --> 37:02.020]  There is a link in the show notes and the video description.
[37:02.020 --> 37:03.980]  Over a thousand members on the Discord channel.
[37:03.980 --> 37:09.620]  When I get done here, as the files load from the cameras into the computer, I actually
[37:09.620 --> 37:13.940]  go hang out on Discord and take a couple of dabs, drink some water, get my voice back.
[37:13.940 --> 37:16.660]  So that's where we'll be for a couple of minutes here.
[37:16.660 --> 37:17.660]  Patreon.
[37:18.540 --> 37:20.500]  Patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[37:20.500 --> 37:21.540]  Show love, give love.
[37:21.540 --> 37:23.460]  Thank you for all of the love.
[37:23.460 --> 37:25.860]  Now is the time to click like and subscribe.
[37:25.860 --> 37:29.700]  If you have not already clicked like on this video, I did slur a little bit, but that's
[37:29.700 --> 37:30.700]  okay.
[37:30.700 --> 37:33.420]  If you have not already clicked like on this video, now is a good time.
[37:33.420 --> 37:35.300]  Also make sure to subscribe.
[37:35.300 --> 37:36.980]  Also there's a little notification bell.
[37:36.980 --> 37:40.860]  If you click on that notification bell, every time I put out a new episode, you'll get a
[37:40.860 --> 37:42.260]  little ding on your phone.
[37:42.260 --> 37:45.020]  You'll know there's a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[37:45.020 --> 37:47.780]  You can jump in, watch the premieres, hang out with us.
[37:47.780 --> 37:51.380]  I'm often in the chat in the premiere of the show.
[37:51.380 --> 37:54.300]  So I'm hanging out, watching the chat, chatting with the crew.
[37:54.300 --> 37:55.300]  Join us.
[37:55.300 --> 37:56.300]  Like and subscribe.
[37:56.300 --> 37:57.300]  All right.
[37:57.300 --> 37:58.300]  That's all I've got for you for this episode.
[37:58.300 --> 38:01.780]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[38:01.780 --> 38:05.740]  I want to send a big shout out to my buddy John at Lollipop Farms.
[38:05.740 --> 38:09.100]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
