[00:17.280 --> 00:19.560]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.560 --> 00:22.800]  It's time for episode number 96 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.440]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.080 --> 00:27.360]  That's right.
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.780]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[00:29.780 --> 00:33.280]  news smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.880]  someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,
[00:36.880 --> 00:38.560]  my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.320 --> 00:39.920]  I'm your host.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.160]  My friends call me Ross DeGeffo.
[00:41.160 --> 00:42.600]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.960 --> 00:44.200]  I'm coming to at you.
[00:44.480 --> 00:45.240]  I can't even speak today.
[00:45.240 --> 00:47.680]  I'm coming to you on a lovely Thursday.
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.000]  It's a bonus Thursday episode.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.600]  You guys, why not put out a Thursday episode?
[00:50.600 --> 00:52.080]  I know the Monday episode was pretty short.
[00:52.600 --> 00:54.520]  Uh, right after I put out the Monday episode, right after I
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.720]  recorded the Monday episode, I went to go look at the news and there
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.520]  was another news article that I feel like you guys need to know about.
[01:00.920 --> 01:03.480]  Uh, so on this episode, it's going to be a quickie, just going to be a
[01:03.480 --> 01:05.320]  midweek quickie, a Thursday bonus episode.
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.200]  I hope you guys enjoy it, but I want to talk about a news article.
[01:08.200 --> 01:11.280]  And then I'm going to talk about something that I saw while doing a
[01:11.280 --> 01:12.760]  consultation at somebody's house.
[01:13.200 --> 01:15.560]  I'm going to try to give you a little bit of guidance and
[01:15.560 --> 01:16.640]  help you improve something.
[01:17.400 --> 01:21.320]  So let's get into this news article that made me want to record.
[01:21.600 --> 01:24.480]  This one says Denver issues, two more pot recalls of pot
[01:24.480 --> 01:26.320]  containing unapproved pesticides.
[01:26.560 --> 01:27.720]  They are at it again.
[01:27.720 --> 01:31.280]  You guys, uh, this article comes from the cannabis and it is written by our
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.760]  friends, David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.600]  So let's get right down to bid.
[01:36.240 --> 01:36.640]  Here we go.
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.000]  It goes like this owners of two Denver marijuana growing facilities on Friday
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.960]  said they were voluntary voluntarily recalling their products after city
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.800]  health officials learned tests found unapproved pesticides, the recall of an
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.200]  undisclosed amount of plants and edible products is the second issued by the
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.840]  Denver department of environmental health.
[01:52.840 --> 01:56.680]  And just over a week underscoring the city's enforcement efforts on companies
[01:56.680 --> 01:59.360]  allegedly using disallowed chemicals.
[01:59.760 --> 02:02.640]  Department officials said retailers should either destroy the recalled
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.440]  products or return them to the manufacturer consumers who have had the
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.480]  products who consumers who have the product should return them to the
[02:10.480 --> 02:12.480]  store of purchase or dispose of them.
[02:12.640 --> 02:13.120]  Take them back.
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.560]  You guys don't throw them away.
[02:14.560 --> 02:15.160]  Take them back.
[02:15.200 --> 02:15.920]  Go get your money back.
[02:15.920 --> 02:16.600]  Get a replacement.
[02:17.120 --> 02:20.920]  Uh, owners of the two impacted businesses summit wellness, which operates as
[02:20.920 --> 02:24.840]  Denver rec, uh, Denver recreational dispensary and sacred seed confirmed.
[02:24.840 --> 02:27.360]  They were removing products from their store shelves.
[02:28.200 --> 02:28.840]  It's true.
[02:29.160 --> 02:32.720]  Uh, Denver rec owner, James Monaco told the Denver post about the recall.
[02:32.960 --> 02:35.880]  We're working through the process and we'll have a statement on our
[02:35.880 --> 02:37.200]  Twitter feed later tonight.
[02:37.640 --> 02:40.440]  The sacred seed recall apparently was the result of pesticides.
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.280]  A rogue employee secretly applied in the middle of the night without
[02:43.280 --> 02:45.720]  permission, CEO, Jeremy Kilbourne told the post.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.240]  Now, is that just an excuse you guys, or do you think that that really happened?
[02:49.240 --> 02:52.600]  Do you think they really had a rogue employee go in the grow rooms in the
[02:52.600 --> 02:55.080]  middle of the night and spray pesticides?
[02:55.360 --> 02:58.200]  Now that pesticide had to be in the damn building for that
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.240]  dude to put in the sprayer.
[02:59.440 --> 03:00.640]  That means he had to go to the store.
[03:00.640 --> 03:01.880]  He had to buy a pesticide.
[03:01.880 --> 03:03.000]  He had to drive to work.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.680]  He had to wait for everybody else to leave.
[03:04.920 --> 03:07.640]  He had to mix that shit up and then he had to spray this shit on the plants.
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.440]  I'm not gonna like call them out and say bullshit, but I might say that I'm not
[03:12.440 --> 03:18.120]  completely sure I completely buy that whole story because how would they know
[03:18.120 --> 03:20.040]  that a rogue employee did that?
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.400]  If nobody ever said anything until the shit was tested and found spray on it,
[03:25.480 --> 03:28.480]  like, did they just go, Oh yeah, that was that time that that guy did that.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.360]  They didn't know that.
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.600]  I feel like they just made that up.
[03:30.640 --> 03:34.240]  The more I talk about it, the more I feel like they are just using that as a,
[03:34.240 --> 03:37.240]  a cop out anyway, I want to get back into the article.
[03:37.480 --> 03:42.880]  Um, the next, uh, paragraph lists all of the, uh, origin, RMCF numbers on all of
[03:42.880 --> 03:46.120]  the products that are recalled because I don't feel the need to read all of these
[03:46.120 --> 03:46.600]  numbers.
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.000]  Um, 90% of my audience is not in Colorado anyway.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.080]  So most of you guys don't have any of these products.
[03:52.400 --> 03:56.280]  If you bought my hot, my products, uh, you may want to contact the dispensary
[03:56.280 --> 03:58.720]  where you got them and you may want to get a refund.
[03:59.480 --> 04:00.400]  So I'm going to continue.
[04:00.400 --> 04:03.640]  It says as in the city's prior marijuana recall, return products
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.440]  cannot be sold until additional testing clears them of residues
[04:06.680 --> 04:08.240]  of the disallowed pesticides.
[04:08.480 --> 04:11.520]  The businesses also have the discretion to destroy them.
[04:11.880 --> 04:12.840]  We're in a state of shock.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.560]  Kilbourn said we pulled everything off of our shelves, self-quarantined
[04:16.560 --> 04:17.760]  our grow and our product.
[04:17.760 --> 04:18.560]  We don't wholesale.
[04:18.560 --> 04:21.720]  So no one has our product out there except the small amount of trim for
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.560]  processing the products subject to the recall had been tested at Mahama Mahatma
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.240]  concentrates in Denver, which was already under a recall issued September
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.040]  eighth for its own products that had tested positive for pesticides that
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.440]  state agriculture officials have not cleared for the use on cannabis.
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.680]  The city's inquiry at Mahatma extended to several businesses that send it.
[04:41.960 --> 04:45.840]  Marijuana trimmings for processing into edible concentrates, such as wax and
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.400]  shatter, which are then returned or distributed to different stores.
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.400]  As a result of the first recall, Mahatma began pesticide testing on all marijuana
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.520]  trimmings that arrive in its Denver facility.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.760]  It was that testing that found pesticides in the latest recalled products.
[05:01.240 --> 05:04.320]  Kilbourn said Mahatma informed him of the test results and the company
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.080]  immediately contacted officials at the Colorado marijuana enforcement division.
[05:08.560 --> 05:11.600]  We're going to be getting it tested and figuring out the extent of damage and
[05:11.600 --> 05:13.560]  destroying materials or throwing it out.
[05:13.800 --> 05:17.720]  However, environmental help, uh, however, environmental health wants us to do.
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.640]  Kilbourn said we're reeling.
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.120]  We're reeling right now.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.520]  Kilbourn said the sacred seed employee responsible for the pesticide misuse had
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.080]  left on Tuesday and offered an explanation in her resignation letter.
[05:29.440 --> 05:30.760]  He said, I'm so sorry.
[05:30.760 --> 05:34.880]  We had a minor bug problem and I was concerned we were going to lose the crop.
[05:34.880 --> 05:39.320]  Kilbourn said of the letter, not only did we tell him not to use those pesticides,
[05:39.560 --> 05:44.160]  we had sent him on to and to others to specialize pesticide handlers training
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.280]  through the Colorado department of agriculture, it was unclear how, uh,
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.240]  Dan rec learned of the test results.
[05:50.360 --> 05:54.160]  Denver inspectors said they only found application log books for the past 30
[05:54.200 --> 05:57.800]  days at den rec and the business said older ones had been destroyed.
[05:57.800 --> 05:58.640]  Reports show.
[06:00.080 --> 06:01.000]  This is weird.
[06:01.280 --> 06:05.520]  A letter of resignation with an apology and destroyed evidence.
[06:05.520 --> 06:07.360]  This is turning into a cannabis soap opera.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.160]  This is kind of neat.
[06:08.640 --> 06:12.040]  Uh, the CDA issued a list earlier this year of products it says can be used on
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.000]  marijuana because the drug is illegal under federal law.
[06:15.000 --> 06:18.760]  No pesticide is specifically approved for use on cannabis, but some label
[06:18.760 --> 06:22.160]  restrictions are so broadly written that using the chemical would not violate
[06:22.880 --> 06:26.160]  federal law mandates that no pesticide may be used in a manner that is
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.640]  not consistent with its label.
[06:28.080 --> 06:31.440]  Most marijuana growers are not well informed about pesticide use and the
[06:31.440 --> 06:32.320]  rules behind them.
[06:32.360 --> 06:34.280]  CDA CDA officials have said.
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.480]  So what appears to solve a problem in a greenhouse could actually be a violation
[06:38.480 --> 06:39.240]  of law.
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.240]  Pesticides are regulated by the U S environmental protection agency, and it
[06:43.240 --> 06:47.800]  offers no information about marijuana because the drug is illegal.
[06:48.640 --> 06:53.880]  So now we are not able to, uh, test pesticides on cannabis to find out the
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.080]  long-term effect, to find out how long that product stays in the cannabis, to
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.520]  find out how much of it actually makes it to the concentrate.
[07:00.880 --> 07:05.160]  It's illegal to test these pesticides on cannabis in the way that we need to do it
[07:05.160 --> 07:10.480]  to find what combats are our problems because cannabis is federally illegal.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.840]  Um, I'm sure you guys know where I'm headed with this, right?
[07:12.840 --> 07:15.080]  The solution to this problem, right?
[07:15.360 --> 07:16.880]  I'm sure you guys all want to say it with me.
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.640]  Legalize cannabis.
[07:19.120 --> 07:21.640]  Then we can test this shit properly and we'll solve this problem.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.320]  Just legalize it.
[07:22.360 --> 07:25.440]  They can make money off of the testing labs would make money.
[07:25.480 --> 07:27.720]  There's another avenue of revenue right there.
[07:28.160 --> 07:30.840]  So there are more products being recalled.
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.720]  You guys, because of pesticides, um, Mahatma concentrates is actually taking
[07:34.720 --> 07:38.560]  it upon themselves to start testing everything that comes in before they run
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.240]  it, uh, before they do the extraction process, they are testing all of the
[07:42.240 --> 07:43.320]  material that comes in.
[07:43.720 --> 07:45.240]  I give kudos to Mahatma.
[07:45.680 --> 07:48.000]  That is a bold step and that is a brave thing to do.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.080]  They have to pay for the testing, which costs money.
[07:50.400 --> 07:53.280]  Uh, and then they're also going to lose clientele because anything that does
[07:53.280 --> 07:55.760]  come back with the contaminant and it cannot be ran.
[07:56.440 --> 07:58.160]  So big shout out to Mahatma.
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.840]  You guys, if you're coming to Colorado to buy products, I want you to feel safe.
[08:02.880 --> 08:05.560]  And this is what we're doing to make you feel safe.
[08:05.560 --> 08:08.240]  We're making sure there are not ridiculous pesticides in here.
[08:08.960 --> 08:12.520]  And they mentioned that department of agriculture, uh, applicators training,
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.080]  uh, course in this article, if you are growing cannabis, I recommend that you
[08:18.120 --> 08:24.280]  go and read your state's, uh, pesticide applicators training manual or
[08:24.280 --> 08:25.920]  certification manual, whatever it is.
[08:25.920 --> 08:29.520]  It varies state by state, but your department of agriculture in your state
[08:29.840 --> 08:35.200]  will have a, an applicators, uh, training guide or a certification guide or
[08:35.200 --> 08:36.200]  something, go read it.
[08:36.400 --> 08:40.400]  You will learn so much about pesticides, about pesticide use, about pesticide
[08:40.400 --> 08:45.040]  safety, you will learn that, uh, most of these products are all derived from the
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.040]  same thing and they are mixed with other carrier agents and that alone will be a
[08:50.040 --> 08:52.480]  useful tool in your ganja growing arsenal.
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.420]  All right.
[08:53.800 --> 08:57.440]  I do in the future plan on doing an integrated pest management episode.
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.120]  Um, I'm, I've got two people lined up that I want to have on that show and
[09:01.120 --> 09:03.120]  getting them here at the same time has been a challenge.
[09:03.120 --> 09:06.760]  I may just do two separate episodes and get them both on separate episodes.
[09:07.200 --> 09:07.440]  All right.
[09:07.440 --> 09:09.080]  That was the news article that I wanted to read you guys.
[09:09.080 --> 09:12.680]  I want to keep you guys updated on what's going on here in Denver or up in Denver.
[09:12.680 --> 09:15.600]  I'm not in Denver, but here in Colorado, up in Denver, I'm about a hundred
[09:15.600 --> 09:16.840]  miles South of Denver, you guys.
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.640]  But I want to keep you going, updated on what's going on.
[09:19.840 --> 09:23.000]  Let you know how this pesticide, uh, drama has been going.
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.880]  And I wanted to kind of give props to Mahatma concentrates for
[09:26.880 --> 09:28.120]  just stepping up their game.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.560]  They're testing everything now.
[09:29.800 --> 09:32.160]  They found out they had a problem instead of trying to hide it.
[09:32.400 --> 09:34.400]  They're like, Hey, we fucked up and look what we're going to do.
[09:34.400 --> 09:35.880]  We're going to test everything.
[09:35.880 --> 09:37.280]  It's going to make a lot of people accountable.
[09:37.640 --> 09:40.680]  And I like the way that this industry is moving.
[09:41.280 --> 09:41.640]  All right.
[09:41.920 --> 09:43.120]  I do want to talk about one more thing.
[09:43.120 --> 09:45.280]  You guys, this is just going to be a short episode.
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.600]  This is just a bonus Thursday episode.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.040]  I wanted to get that news article out, but since I'm here recording, I want to
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.320]  talk about something that I saw a few days ago while I was at a consultation.
[09:56.840 --> 09:59.680]  A lot of times when I go to a consultation, the people will have a
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.920]  problem that they need corrected, but sometimes they just want me to observe
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.120]  what they're doing and see what we can improve or make easier for them.
[10:07.160 --> 10:09.640]  That will make their cannabis crop come out a little bit better.
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.160]  So, um, I want to tell you guys a little something about what I saw at a
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.480]  consultation with a client a few days ago, and I just want to kind of correct this.
[10:18.480 --> 10:21.080]  And I don't know if you're doing this wrong or if you could be doing this
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.800]  better, but I'm sure that there are a couple people out there who will benefit
[10:24.800 --> 10:28.800]  from this, so I was just watching this guy work in his garden.
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.920]  Uh, I just showed up at his house.
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.720]  I was like, what's up, man?
[10:31.720 --> 10:32.360]  I know you need help.
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.040]  Let's go check it out.
[10:33.040 --> 10:36.000]  And we walked out there and he said, I saved all my chores for when you got
[10:36.560 --> 10:37.920]  And we're just going to do my gardening.
[10:37.920 --> 10:39.040]  And I was like, that sounds great.
[10:39.440 --> 10:40.280]  And so I helped him out.
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.800]  I filled some buckets and we did what we did.
[10:41.800 --> 10:42.480]  And I watched him.
[10:42.960 --> 10:48.120]  Now, the first thing this dude did that I corrected was this guy gets a five
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.960]  gallon bucket and he pours his nutrients into a glass to measure.
[10:52.160 --> 10:54.760]  And then he pours all of the nutrients into the five gallon bucket.
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.880]  You guys, you cannot do that.
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.360]  Um, I will explain why I am not a scientist, but I know why these, uh, the
[11:02.360 --> 11:04.120]  reason that they're sold in different bottles.
[11:04.120 --> 11:07.120]  So if you go by, I'm just going to use advanced nutrients because it's the
[11:07.120 --> 11:08.880]  product that it's popped up in my mind.
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.200]  They've got, uh, they've got a flower, a, they've got a flower B and then
[11:13.200 --> 11:14.800]  there's like a bloom booster.
[11:15.080 --> 11:17.080]  And then there's like a flavor booster.
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.640]  Advanced nutrients has so many bottles.
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.880]  The reason those are all sold separately is because if they put those products
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.160]  all into one container, uh, the elements in there will bond.
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.680]  That's why we need to add those products to water and never mix them
[11:33.680 --> 11:34.800]  together, concentrated.
[11:34.800 --> 11:36.640]  Those are very concentrated products.
[11:36.840 --> 11:39.640]  You're only adding a few milliliters to five gallons of water.
[11:40.040 --> 11:42.920]  So the first thing I'm going to say is fill up your container that you're
[11:42.920 --> 11:46.800]  going to mix into probably a five gallon bucket, fill that with water first,
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.600]  preferably reverse osmosis water, but we can't all do that.
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.520]  So fill your five gallon bucket with water.
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.240]  Always fill it with water first, then add the nutrients to the water.
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.320]  Never mix nutrients without water.
[11:59.480 --> 12:00.240]  They are buffered.
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.960]  They are sold separately for a reason.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.600]  They are buffered and chelated and they are not meant to be
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.760]  mixed in concentrate together.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.680]  So the best I can recommend is to either mix them into a one gallon pitcher so
[12:12.680 --> 12:16.320]  that if you do make a mistake, you don't waste five gallons of water or just mix
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.040]  the nutrients one at a time into your five gallon bucket, but never pour them.
[12:20.520 --> 12:22.640]  In concentrate form into a container together.
[12:22.680 --> 12:23.720]  That is not a good thing.
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.120]  You're causing problems already.
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.200]  So fill your bucket, get a pitcher of water from that bucket, mix your
[12:29.200 --> 12:31.000]  nutrient solution into the pitcher.
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.360]  Use a quality measuring device.
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.160]  You guys go get something from the growth store or a scientific store.
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.560]  The stuff you use for your kitchen is close, but it is not going to be as
[12:40.560 --> 12:45.080]  accurate as something you could get from the grow store and do not use something
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.520]  from the kitchen and then put it back in the kitchen, you can't use the same shit.
[12:48.520 --> 12:50.360]  You've got to have a dedicated one for your grow.
[12:50.600 --> 12:53.240]  You don't want to be mixing your whatever kind of food you're mixing.
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.160]  You're measuring out your vanilla extract and the same damn measuring device that
[12:57.160 --> 12:58.240]  you're mixing up your nutrients.
[12:58.240 --> 12:58.720]  Don't do that.
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.520]  That's tacky and it's unsanitary.
[13:00.520 --> 13:02.360]  It's either going to get you sick or your plant sick.
[13:02.360 --> 13:03.160]  Don't fuck with that.
[13:03.520 --> 13:05.360]  Go get some, some dedicated stuff.
[13:05.680 --> 13:06.840]  So measure really carefully.
[13:06.840 --> 13:08.680]  You guys be accurate with your measurements.
[13:08.880 --> 13:10.840]  If it says 25 milliliters.
[13:11.600 --> 13:12.880]  Okay, well, here's something I should say.
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.080]  If the bottle says 50 milliliters, probably use half of that to start.
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.440]  I have never needed to use as much as recommended on the bottle.
[13:19.720 --> 13:21.960]  The nutrient companies want you to buy more.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.960]  They recommend that you use a little bit extra.
[13:24.800 --> 13:27.680]  So you don't always have to use as much as it says, start with maybe a half, two
[13:27.680 --> 13:29.240]  thirds and work your way up from there.
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.560]  But measure carefully.
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.640]  If you're trying to put in 25 milliliters, measure 25 milliliters, write it down.
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.040]  So that if something goes wrong, you know, next time that 26 or 27, isn't what you
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.160]  did. 25 is what you did and it either worked or it did not.
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.320]  So 25 is your number to go to next time and adjust from there.
[13:46.560 --> 13:47.600]  So measure carefully.
[13:47.960 --> 13:49.920]  Um, like I just said, take notes all the time.
[13:49.920 --> 13:52.600]  I should always remind you guys to take notes, always take notes when you're
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.240]  growing cannabis.
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.600]  It's the only way you know what you did and what you didn't do and what worked
[13:56.600 --> 13:57.440]  and what didn't work.
[13:57.720 --> 13:59.360]  I know you're going to think I'll remember doing that.
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.480]  You're growing cannabis, which means you're probably smoking cannabis, which
[14:02.480 --> 14:03.360]  means you're going to forget.
[14:03.400 --> 14:04.920]  So write that shit down.
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.160]  So, uh, now you've got everything measured, right?
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.360]  You've taken a pitcher of water.
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.240]  You've poured your grow a, into a small measuring device, dump that into the
[14:13.240 --> 14:17.200]  pitcher, pour B into the measuring device, dump that in the pitcher, all your
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.040]  additives, put that into there.
[14:19.320 --> 14:21.240]  Uh, then clean out your measuring device.
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.240]  You guys go clean it right now before you do anything else, go clean it.
[14:24.560 --> 14:24.840]  All right.
[14:24.840 --> 14:27.800]  So now you've got a pitcher dump that pitcher into your five gallon
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.520]  a bucket with water in there.
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.440]  So now you've got five gallons of perfectly mixed water.
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.600]  Um, yeah, if you do make a mistake, all you gotta do is dump out that
[14:36.600 --> 14:37.760]  pitcher and then just start fresh.
[14:37.760 --> 14:40.760]  Of course you wasted your nutrients, but you didn't just dump out five gallons of
[14:40.760 --> 14:41.080]  water.
[14:41.080 --> 14:43.320]  You don't have to wait for a five gallon bucket to refill.
[14:43.720 --> 14:44.360]  Uh, it'll help you out.
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.960]  And if you're using reverse osmosis water, you just saved even more because when
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.600]  you make reverse osmosis water, there's a lot of water that gets thrown away.
[14:51.600 --> 14:54.640]  So it's hard to, it's hard to waste water when you're using reverse osmosis
[14:54.640 --> 14:54.960]  water.
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.400]  Uh, let's see.
[14:57.080 --> 14:58.440]  Um, so now you've got your bucket.
[14:58.680 --> 15:00.160]  It's filled with your nutrient solution.
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.200]  It's filled with water.
[15:01.320 --> 15:03.440]  Now it's time to test the pH.
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.080]  Um, I've seen people adjust the pH of their water before they add the nutrients,
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.520]  which is a fail because you're going to pH it and then put shit in it.
[15:12.800 --> 15:13.040]  Yeah.
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.640]  So once you've got all of your nutrients in there, every single nutrient, that is
[15:16.640 --> 15:20.440]  when you adjust the pH, use pH up or pH down to correct it.
[15:20.960 --> 15:21.720]  Uh, write it down.
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.640]  You guys write down the pH.
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.560]  If you get it at 6.5, write it down.
[15:26.560 --> 15:29.000]  If you get it at 6.3, write that down.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.800]  If it's 6.7, write it down.
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.400]  If you're in hydro, you're going lower still write it the fuck down so that when
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.160]  you see those plants doing something, you know, if you were right or wrong with
[15:40.160 --> 15:44.440]  your measurement and you have a reference for where to go to next time, you can't
[15:44.440 --> 15:46.760]  make adjustments if you don't know what you did last time.
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.800]  So now we've got our nutrients mixed up in a five gallon bucket.
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.760]  We've got it properly pH to about 6.5.
[15:52.800 --> 15:54.000]  We wrote that down.
[15:54.400 --> 15:56.600]  Uh, we wrote down how much nutrients we've used.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.280]  Now it's time to water each plant.
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.400]  You guys, when you go watering the plants, this is something that I saw my, uh, my
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.280]  client do the other day.
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.520]  He poured the water directly in the center of the pot, right over the stock,
[16:08.560 --> 16:09.880]  right into the middle of the damn plant.
[16:10.560 --> 16:13.440]  Um, if you're using enough water, that'll work.
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.440]  But here's what I would recommend.
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.920]  It is wiser and more healthy for the plant to start on the outer edge of the
[16:20.320 --> 16:23.840]  because the roots that are newer and fresher and growing and searching for
[16:23.840 --> 16:25.720]  water are those outer roots.
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.040]  So you want to get the outer perimeter of the dirt, wet the inside of the root zone
[16:30.040 --> 16:33.080]  there, the water will work its way in because the roots will pull it there.
[16:33.400 --> 16:35.320]  So think about a cannabis plant.
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.680]  Let's envision a cannabis plant standing there out in a field by itself or with
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.240]  other friends, whichever you got a cannabis plant standing there, the leaves
[16:43.240 --> 16:45.560]  hang off of it and sort of like a tent shape.
[16:45.560 --> 16:46.880]  If you think about it, it's like a tent.
[16:46.880 --> 16:49.240]  It's protecting the inside of that plant from moisture.
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.480]  So when the rain hits it, if rain comes down from the sky, rain hits the plant
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.600]  and it's being brought out to the outer edge of the plant, hardly any water will
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.160]  land on the ground near the stock of that plant because all of the leaves
[17:02.160 --> 17:03.600]  are pushing it out to the perimeter.
[17:04.320 --> 17:10.280]  So I kind of believe that a plant will grow as wide as its root mass will allow it.
[17:10.520 --> 17:13.800]  So if you water the outer edge of that pot, then your plant's going to grow
[17:13.800 --> 17:16.160]  wider because it's going to feel like it's getting more water.
[17:16.560 --> 17:19.880]  Also that wideness of the plant should kind of represent the root mass.
[17:20.160 --> 17:23.680]  So when the rain comes down, the rain will drip off of the plant and fall
[17:23.680 --> 17:25.080]  right at the perimeter of the plant.
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.000]  And that's where those roots are in my opinion.
[17:27.240 --> 17:28.640]  And so it'll drink that right up.
[17:28.640 --> 17:32.120]  And it also, if you water the outside of that, it'll keep your roots active.
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.200]  So don't go dumping the water right in the middle of the pot, kind of
[17:35.200 --> 17:36.760]  try to water around the outer edge.
[17:36.960 --> 17:39.080]  I mean, you're going to want to soak the soil anyway, but make
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.720]  sure you get that outer area wet.
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.240]  That's, that's the important part.
[17:42.240 --> 17:43.280]  Not right there in the middle.
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.800]  One good way to do that, you guys, if you have time and I hope you do
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  make a little mound around your stock, just grab a handful of the soil in the,
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.520]  in the pot and just kind of make a little, a conular shape, like a mound
[17:55.520 --> 17:58.880]  around the stock so that when you water, the water runs down that and
[17:58.880 --> 18:00.520]  runs towards the edges of the pots.
[18:00.760 --> 18:01.880]  That's what I would recommend.
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.200]  So my point is try to get the water to the outer edge of the pot.
[18:06.200 --> 18:07.360]  Not so much in the center.
[18:07.680 --> 18:10.040]  So that's a couple of things that I saw at a consultation that I
[18:10.040 --> 18:11.280]  thought I would share with you guys.
[18:11.280 --> 18:13.560]  Also, you guys clean up after yourselves.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.360]  Um, don't do something tomorrow that could be done today because when you
[18:19.360 --> 18:22.120]  start getting lazy as a grower, that's when you fall behind, that's when
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.000]  shit gets messy, when shit gets behind and messy is when you have problems.
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.240]  When you're growing on a professional level and you're trying to have
[18:29.240 --> 18:32.640]  professional quality buds for yourself and your clients and your patients
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.680]  and whatever you, whoever else you're growing for, you need to be in there
[18:35.680 --> 18:37.560]  every day, you need to be diligent.
[18:37.560 --> 18:38.720]  You need to be on top of shit.
[18:38.960 --> 18:40.480]  Nothing can wait until tomorrow.
[18:40.480 --> 18:44.760]  If it needs to be done today, you should probably get in there and do it today
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.200]  because plants are only alive.
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.040]  If you think about it, your plants are only alive.
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.800]  They're in flower for nine weeks.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.000]  That's 63 days.
[18:51.360 --> 18:54.000]  Uh, plants only live for about a hundred days indoors, maybe
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.040]  120, 150 at the most.
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.920]  So you've only got 150 days.
[18:57.920 --> 19:01.240]  Why not make every single day for your plant count, right?
[19:01.400 --> 19:02.400]  Your patients will know it.
[19:02.760 --> 19:04.280]  Your flowers will show it in the end.
[19:04.600 --> 19:05.560]  It'll be well worth your time.
[19:05.560 --> 19:06.640]  Just get in there and do that shit.
[19:07.720 --> 19:08.600]  Um, let's see.
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.160]  I want to talk a little bit about defoliation a little bit.
[19:11.440 --> 19:13.600]  I've been experimenting with defoliation.
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.320]  What that is, is just going and taking off all of the big
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.240]  fan leaves early in flower.
[19:19.640 --> 19:23.280]  Uh, I put two plants side by side, the same exact strain I used to Jeff's
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.360]  OG because it's something I'm very familiar with and I tore off all of
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.560]  the fan leaves on one plant, uh, about a week into flower, I, all of the
[19:32.560 --> 19:36.800]  fan leaves, if there was a PDL, I'd cut that leaf off at the PDL right at the
[19:36.800 --> 19:37.160]  stem.
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.080]  So this plant looked completely naked.
[19:39.400 --> 19:41.160]  It was just a bunch of buds up a stick.
[19:41.440 --> 19:42.320]  There were no leaves.
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.640]  And the one next to it looks like a big leafy pot plant.
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.680]  Um, as time went on, the leaves grew back.
[19:47.680 --> 19:49.960]  You guys, I went and cut those leaves off again.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.560]  I did it about every seven to 10 days.
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.440]  I was in there cutting off major amounts of leaf off of these plants.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.960]  Uh, it started growing so much leaf toward week six that it looked just
[20:00.960 --> 20:03.280]  like the plant next to it, that I had never defoliated.
[20:03.280 --> 20:06.120]  It was spitting out a lot of leaf, but I kept cutting them off.
[20:06.120 --> 20:08.040]  They were just little tiny leaves just trying to grow out.
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.240]  Um, I wasn't getting too crazy.
[20:10.240 --> 20:16.920]  It was my first time trying it, but I noticed that the lower buds got chunkier.
[20:17.240 --> 20:20.520]  I didn't think it would work that way because my opinion has always been that
[20:20.520 --> 20:23.960]  those bigger leaves were the solar collectors that got off the light for my
[20:23.960 --> 20:25.520]  plant that gave the plant energy.
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.480]  Um, I may have to experiment more with this defoliating.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.720]  I've noticed I get a little better airflow.
[20:32.720 --> 20:36.080]  The plants seem to be just happier when I cut down a lot of the leaf.
[20:36.280 --> 20:41.280]  So you guys, if you have some leaves that are shadowing a bud, or if your
[20:41.280 --> 20:44.760]  plant looks a little bit too leafy, I encourage you to choose one plant in
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.360]  your garden and maybe experiment with a little bit of extreme defoliation.
[20:48.560 --> 20:51.000]  You don't have to go extreme if you don't want to, but if you want to,
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.320]  the plants will handle it.
[20:52.320 --> 20:52.760]  You guys.
[20:53.200 --> 20:57.120]  Um, I think I got on the one plant that I did not defoliate.
[20:57.120 --> 20:58.480]  It was in a seven gallon pot.
[20:58.680 --> 21:02.560]  I got five and a half ounces of Jeff's OG and the plant that was
[21:02.560 --> 21:05.040]  defoliated, I got six and a quarter.
[21:05.280 --> 21:08.760]  So that's three quarters of an ounce, which is not a whole lot of a
[21:08.760 --> 21:13.240]  difference when you go by a whole room, but that's still 21 grams of cannabis
[21:13.240 --> 21:14.640]  just by cutting off some leaves.
[21:14.680 --> 21:15.880]  And I did everything else the same.
[21:15.880 --> 21:18.600]  You guys, the plants looked very similar up until that moment.
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.280]  So that's a little bit of defoliating.
[21:21.280 --> 21:24.160]  If you guys have any comments or if you want to know more about that, let me
[21:24.160 --> 21:27.120]  know that's just something I was playing with in my garden and I thought I
[21:27.120 --> 21:28.480]  would share it with you guys.
[21:29.440 --> 21:29.720]  All right.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.160]  I'm going to wrap up this bonus Thursday episode.
[21:32.360 --> 21:34.040]  I appreciate you guys for hanging out with me.
[21:34.320 --> 21:37.760]  I think this is a good makeup for my short episode last week, right?
[21:37.800 --> 21:40.800]  Instead of a one 30 minute, you guys got two 20 minute episodes.
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.120]  That should work for you.
[21:42.440 --> 21:42.600]  Dude.
[21:42.600 --> 21:46.040]  I really appreciate you guys for listening to me and supporting the podcast.
[21:46.040 --> 21:48.160]  I've been getting a lot, a lot of lessons lately.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.240]  I can tell by the website.
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.760]  I just go and check out some stats.
[21:51.040 --> 21:52.440]  You guys are really paying attention.
[21:52.440 --> 21:53.440]  You're listening to the show.
[21:53.440 --> 21:55.080]  I completely appreciate it.
[21:55.080 --> 21:55.520]  You guys.
[21:56.040 --> 21:59.920]  What I would truly appreciate is if you went to iTunes, go to the iTunes
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.360]  store, find the review section.
[22:01.800 --> 22:04.040]  Uh, give me a five star rating on there and type in a comment.
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.680]  Let me know what you think about the show.
[22:05.960 --> 22:08.600]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[22:09.080 --> 22:12.320]  Um, the reason that I want you guys to leave comments and give me a five star
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.240]  rating is because that's what moves me up in the ranks and iTunes.
[22:16.480 --> 22:19.560]  And if I move up in the ranks and iTunes, more people will see the show.
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.320]  They'll put my, my logo up there in the hot shit section somewhere.
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.240]  And then people will click and they will listen.
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.560]  And then more people will learn how to grow quality cannabis.
[22:28.560 --> 22:31.520]  And the more people that are learning to grow quality cannabis, which means
[22:31.760 --> 22:35.720]  will mean there's more quality cannabis of cannabis available for everyone.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.080]  To smoke that English is getting hard.
[22:39.080 --> 22:40.880]  So I'm just going to end this show already.
[22:41.240 --> 22:44.240]  Uh, you guys don't forget that the show is available on iTunes stitcher and
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.880]  every single episode is always in forever archived on I read genetics, Colorado.com.
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.280]  Make sure you check me out on all the social media.
[22:51.280 --> 22:52.480]  I'm on all of them.
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.320]  I'm on most of them.
[22:53.320 --> 22:54.640]  If I'm not on something, let me know.
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.320]  I'll get on there.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.320]  You guys, I'm wrapping up this show.
[22:57.680 --> 22:59.680]  Uh, my throat's burning out and words are getting hard.
[22:59.680 --> 23:02.360]  So it's time to go take some dabs until next time.
[23:02.400 --> 23:03.440]  Oh, I almost missed a part.
[23:03.440 --> 23:05.120]  I'm going to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[23:05.440 --> 23:06.880]  Uh, thanks for listening until next time.
[23:06.880 --> 23:09.440]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
