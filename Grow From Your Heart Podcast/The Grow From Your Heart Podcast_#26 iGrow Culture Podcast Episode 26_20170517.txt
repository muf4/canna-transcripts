[00:27.440 --> 00:29.720]  Thanks for joining me for the 26th episode.
[00:29.720 --> 00:33.680]  In this episode, Jesse and Adam and myself talk about some outdoor growing.
[00:33.680 --> 00:36.800]  I've got Adam hanging out while I record this intro on a Sunday night.
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.800]  What's going on, bro?
[00:37.800 --> 00:38.800]  What's up, man?
[00:38.800 --> 00:41.320]  Loving tonight, taking some dabs, getting a little bit wrecked.
[00:41.320 --> 00:43.400]  Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[00:43.400 --> 00:46.080]  We're having fun tonight trying to record this episode.
[00:46.080 --> 00:49.240]  Last night, Adam, another friend of myself, went to Denver to watch Joe Rogan record his
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.720]  special for Comedy Central.
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.800]  We'll talk about that at the end of the show.

[02:49.200 --> 02:50.200]  So let's get right down to it.
[02:50.960 --> 02:54.080]  Jesse came over for a grow lesson, taught us a lot of stuff about outdoor growing.
[02:54.080 --> 02:55.080]  Adam hung out and learned a few things.
[02:55.080 --> 02:57.520]  So I'm going to let the music play for a second.
[02:57.520 --> 02:59.040]  We're going to go ahead and fade in that conversation.
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.200]  And then after that, Adam and I will be back to wrap up the show.
[03:02.200 --> 03:04.200]  Hang out and listen guys.
[03:04.200 --> 03:05.200]  Thanks.
[03:05.200 --> 03:16.480]  Eventually, they're just going to fucking stick my iPhone in my head and I can just
[03:16.480 --> 03:19.400]  think like text Adam and tell him to come over and take dabs with me.
[03:19.400 --> 03:20.400]  That would be funny.
[03:20.400 --> 03:22.440]  Yeah, we're recording now just so that you guys are aware.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.720]  Your next thought would be a little weird.
[03:23.720 --> 03:24.720]  Hey, what's up guys?
[03:24.800 --> 03:25.800]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:25.800 --> 03:26.800]  We're just here having a little random conversation.
[03:26.800 --> 03:28.440]  We're going to have a grow lesson.
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.880]  We got Jesse back as promised.
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.880]  Hey, what's up?
[03:30.880 --> 03:32.280]  Thanks for coming, bro.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.280]  Also, Adam's back.
[03:33.280 --> 03:36.880]  Adam's, he's on the show all the time, but you guys might not know that Adam's a new
[03:36.880 --> 03:37.880]  grower.
[03:37.880 --> 03:38.880]  He's kind of new to Colorado.
[03:38.880 --> 03:42.360]  It's his first grow season here and he does have some outdoor plants.
[03:42.360 --> 03:45.480]  So I invited him to stick around while Jesse's here.
[03:45.480 --> 03:47.040]  He may have some good outdoor questions.
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.120]  He may bring up some shit that we may overlook.
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.920]  So it's always good to have a new guy in to kind of referee us because I've been told
[03:54.120 --> 03:57.600]  we're kind of snobs and we go a little fast and we talk about shit like everybody should
[03:57.600 --> 03:58.600]  know.
[03:58.600 --> 03:59.600]  So we'll slow down.
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.440]  We'll try to go slow for you guys and keep it at a pace where you can keep up.
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.280]  But I do plan to increase the knowledge in this show slowly but surely over time so that
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.400]  you guys can all improve, take your grow to the next level.
[04:10.400 --> 04:11.400]  That's right.
[04:11.400 --> 04:12.400]  Knowledge is power.
[04:12.400 --> 04:13.400]  That came from Adam.
[04:13.400 --> 04:14.400]  Yeah.
[04:14.400 --> 04:15.400]  Never stop learning.
[04:15.400 --> 04:17.400]  That might be the smartest thing Adam's going to say all day.
[04:17.400 --> 04:18.400]  That's it.
[04:18.400 --> 04:19.960]  You guys said I was too loud in the headphones.
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.200]  I got to turn that shit up now.
[04:21.200 --> 04:22.200]  You guys are crazy.
[04:22.200 --> 04:23.520]  No, you were too loud in my headphones.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.120]  All right.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.400]  So of course we're back for an outdoor grow lesson.
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.600]  It's full bloom time.
[04:27.600 --> 04:29.400]  Your plants should be starting to flower.
[04:29.400 --> 04:32.200]  You guys rock and rolling, rocking and rolling.
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.200]  All right.
[04:33.200 --> 04:34.200]  All right.
[04:34.200 --> 04:35.200]  Signs of flower.
[04:35.200 --> 04:36.200]  Hopefully you guys have pulled your mails.
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.480]  It's time to pull the mails now, right?
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.480]  It's past time.
[04:39.480 --> 04:40.480]  Wait, wait.
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.440]  Kevin pulled your mails.
[04:42.440 --> 04:45.280]  You've got a seeded crop and your neighbors have a seeded crop and someone else on the
[04:45.280 --> 04:48.020]  block has a seeded crop and they're all pissed off at you.
[04:48.020 --> 04:49.560]  So you fucked up.
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.800]  But hopefully you pulled your mails by now because you're in full bloom.
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.920]  So that means we're probably 25, 30 days in.
[04:56.920 --> 04:57.920]  He's pulling out a calendar.
[04:57.920 --> 04:59.560]  That's why we have a little bit of silence.
[04:59.560 --> 05:00.560]  Yeah, sure.
[05:00.560 --> 05:01.560]  For some strains.
[05:01.560 --> 05:02.560]  For some strains.
[05:02.560 --> 05:03.560]  Okay.
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.000]  Adam was saying he had one that took a long time to switch into flower.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.120]  It's just now getting to the point where it's like visibly flower.
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.120]  It probably did.
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.720]  It probably switched last week or so officially, you know, but it is, it had definitely taken,
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.240]  it might be a little bit longer, but it, it, the other two had switched into flower three
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.600]  or four weeks ago, obviously, and now have decent sides, quarter size buds.
[05:26.600 --> 05:27.600]  Nice.
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.600]  Nice.
[05:28.600 --> 05:29.600]  That's about where I am.
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.600]  Here's a random question.
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.880]  Uh, how long since you're an outdoor grower?
[05:31.880 --> 05:32.880]  I'm asking Jesse.
[05:32.880 --> 05:34.160]  He's an out inexperienced outdoor grower.
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.160]  I'm a city boy.
[05:35.160 --> 05:36.160]  I live indoors.
[05:36.160 --> 05:37.160]  I grow indoors.
[05:37.160 --> 05:38.160]  I don't worry too much about the outside.
[05:38.160 --> 05:39.280]  I don't know the answer.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.280]  I am a city boy.
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.360]  Uh, yeah, you take me to the sticks and I'm fucking scared, bro.
[05:43.360 --> 05:46.160]  I need a gun to fucking protect myself out there.
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.160]  But uh, me too.
[05:47.160 --> 05:48.160]  Okay.
[05:49.160 --> 05:52.160]  But if you don't jump at everything, I'm like, Oh, what was that?
[05:52.160 --> 05:53.160]  What was that?
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.160]  It was fucking life, dude.
[05:54.160 --> 05:55.160]  Chill out.
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.160]  Uh, what was I going to ask you now?
[05:56.160 --> 05:57.160]  Oh, okay.
[05:57.160 --> 05:58.320]  How long do we have?
[05:58.320 --> 06:01.800]  How many weeks or about when do you expect frost?
[06:01.800 --> 06:04.160]  When does it get too cold for our outdoor crop?
[06:04.160 --> 06:08.040]  Um, that's a, that's always a good question.
[06:08.040 --> 06:11.160]  If I know the answer to that, you're not mother nature, are you?
[06:11.160 --> 06:12.160]  Yeah.
[06:12.160 --> 06:13.160]  Okay.
[06:13.160 --> 06:14.480]  Uh, I've noticed, sorry, go ahead.
[06:14.480 --> 06:19.720]  Oh, would you agree that in Colorado, uh, in Pueblo, Colorado, nature loves to snow
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.040]  on Halloween and fuck up all the kids' costumes on Halloween.
[06:23.040 --> 06:27.960]  That's kind of our traditional, you know, so get them down October 30th.
[06:27.960 --> 06:31.840]  Uh, you'll start to be able to tell if you guys are in your climate snap.
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.600]  So I'm going to grab a calendar right quick.
[06:33.600 --> 06:36.800]  I want to see how many weeks I'll just ask Siri.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.800]  She'll tell me.
[06:37.800 --> 06:38.800]  Siri is great.
[06:38.800 --> 06:39.800]  Yeah.
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.000]  You got to use how many days until Halloween?
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.840]  Oh, there we go.
[06:45.840 --> 06:46.840]  She'll tell me.
[06:46.840 --> 06:47.840]  Thank you.
[06:47.840 --> 06:48.840]  She failed.
[06:48.840 --> 06:50.960]  Siri's been a not friendly chick today.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.960]  Fire.
[06:51.960 --> 06:56.160]  How many days until Halloween?
[06:56.160 --> 06:57.160]  She's looking.
[06:57.160 --> 06:58.160]  70 days.
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.880]  Oh, so most strains should be done.
[07:00.880 --> 07:01.880]  Yeah.
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.720]  Even your stuff that just started flowering should be done.
[07:03.720 --> 07:04.720]  All right.
[07:04.720 --> 07:05.720]  Yeah.
[07:05.720 --> 07:06.720]  Cool.
[07:06.720 --> 07:09.280]  Um, 70 days from, so today is actually Thursday.
[07:09.280 --> 07:10.760]  The show won't go up until Monday morning.
[07:10.760 --> 07:15.160]  So you're going to have closer to 65, but you probably won't listen until Wednesday.
[07:15.160 --> 07:18.480]  So for sure you're getting down nine weeks.
[07:18.480 --> 07:22.640]  You get about nine weeks to flower guys, nine or 10 weeks, depending on where you are.
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.680]  If you're in California, you can get that shit out.
[07:24.680 --> 07:25.680]  No problem.
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.000]  But if you're in Colorado, you got about nine weeks.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.200]  If you're higher up, if you're towards Denver, you may want to cut that little closer to
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.040]  Thanksgiving people.
[07:35.040 --> 07:38.320]  Folks in California have been flowering longer than us.
[07:38.320 --> 07:40.720]  It seems like a lot of them, you know, from the pictures I've seen.
[07:41.680 --> 07:42.680]  They definitely went into flower sooner.
[07:42.680 --> 07:47.520]  I can imagine several things that why that would be, but I wonder what the actual reason
[07:47.520 --> 07:48.520]  is.
[07:48.520 --> 07:50.840]  Do you think they've selected a better strains?
[07:50.840 --> 07:52.360]  Um, no.
[07:52.360 --> 07:54.040]  Auto flowers.
[07:54.040 --> 07:55.040]  Okay.
[07:55.040 --> 08:01.760]  Send all hate mail to, uh, I don't know.
[08:01.760 --> 08:08.600]  I wonder if, uh, the coast, maybe like just their different region, they're at a different,
[08:08.600 --> 08:11.720]  uh, latitude and longitude in the earth.
[08:11.720 --> 08:14.120]  Uh, north and south makes a huge difference.
[08:14.120 --> 08:18.440]  They get the sun, you know, slightly different angle or something like that.
[08:18.440 --> 08:21.880]  You guys, if somebody understands why those plants in Cali flowered sooner, I think we
[08:21.880 --> 08:22.880]  just nailed it.
[08:22.880 --> 08:26.800]  But if you got the, if you got the science, you reason tweet that to me, email it to me.
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.840]  I grow culture at hotmail.com at I grow culture on Twitter.
[08:28.840 --> 08:29.840]  Let me know.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.840]  We'd like to understand more of that.
[08:30.840 --> 08:32.720]  Uh, I grew culture on Facebook.
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.440]  We get it, but we want you to explain it because we're podcast hosts and stoners and, uh, that's
[08:37.440 --> 08:39.080]  fucking, you can explain it.
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.080]  We'd like to understand.
[08:40.080 --> 08:41.080]  Yeah.
[08:41.080 --> 08:42.080]  Yeah.
[08:42.080 --> 08:44.720]  So I asked Jesse at the, when he got here, we took a bunch of dabs of course.
[08:44.720 --> 08:46.760]  And then we talked about what we wanted to do.
[08:46.760 --> 08:49.240]  Uh, he talked about top dressing a little bit.
[08:49.240 --> 08:51.440]  Do you want to talk about the mulching and the top dressing?
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[08:52.440 --> 08:57.360]  Um, you know, I, I think it's safe to say to go ahead and, uh, switch over all your,
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.600]  uh, top dressings and your teas and stuff to, you know, throw in that, that high P stuff.
[09:02.600 --> 09:04.280]  Uh, high PK.
[09:04.280 --> 09:08.880]  Um, you know, pretty much chill out on the nitrogen.
[09:08.880 --> 09:16.200]  Um, Adam's got some plants that are nitrogen deficient visibly on the lower, lower bottom,
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.800]  lower third of the plant.
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.520]  I told him to hit it real good with nitrogen one more time.
[09:21.520 --> 09:23.400]  Real hard for his feeding.
[09:23.400 --> 09:24.400]  And you'd think, yeah, okay.
[09:24.400 --> 09:25.400]  All right.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.400]  I'm going to turn this mic a little more to your face.
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.400]  Sorry.
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.400]  Sorry.
[09:28.400 --> 09:29.720]  We're getting Jesse trained on podcast.
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.760]  It'll be a lot more audible now.
[09:31.760 --> 09:32.760]  I just noticed that.
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.760]  Um, oh yeah.
[09:34.240 --> 09:35.240]  Look at that.
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.240]  We can hear him.
[09:36.240 --> 09:37.240]  Yeah.
[09:37.240 --> 09:38.240]  Sorry.
[09:38.240 --> 09:39.240]  No worries, bro.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.240]  You're learning to do your way.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.680]  I got to compliment you're way more comfortable, way more fluid on the show now compared to
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.680]  the first episode.
[09:42.680 --> 09:43.680]  Nice.
[09:43.680 --> 09:45.920]  I think you were on number eight or six.
[09:45.920 --> 09:48.400]  There's number eight and we're at 26 now, bro.
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.120]  So you've been coming quite a few times.
[09:50.120 --> 09:51.120]  Nice.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.120]  Yeah.
[09:52.120 --> 09:53.120]  All right.
[09:53.120 --> 09:54.120]  Keep going.
[09:54.120 --> 09:55.120]  Sorry.
[09:55.120 --> 09:56.120]  I totally interrupted you.
[09:56.120 --> 09:59.040]  Maybe, uh, give it like a little full of your feed, uh, locally just to that part of the
[09:59.040 --> 10:01.040]  plant, a high nitrogen.
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.120]  Um, you know, uh, several different ways you could do that.
[10:05.120 --> 10:11.640]  My option is basically to put grow in a bottle and spray it for sure.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.640]  Yeah.
[10:12.640 --> 10:13.640]  Really, really dilute.
[10:13.640 --> 10:14.640]  Yeah.
[10:14.640 --> 10:15.640]  Yeah.
[10:15.640 --> 10:16.640]  Yeah.
[10:16.640 --> 10:17.640]  For sure.
[10:17.640 --> 10:18.640]  That would work.
[10:18.640 --> 10:20.760]  If anything, that's my problem is I'm a little underfeeding.
[10:20.760 --> 10:21.760]  You know what I'm saying?
[10:21.760 --> 10:22.760]  Yeah.
[10:22.760 --> 10:25.720]  I mean, you gave me the chart and I've just been basically going off of that besides all
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.960]  the additives that I've should have gotten probably by now that I don't have.
[10:28.960 --> 10:29.960]  Yes.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.960]  I mean, I did buy a couple of things.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.640]  Um, and I didn't get them.
[10:32.640 --> 10:34.000]  So now you can see it.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  Oh yeah.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.640]  And yeah, well now that's, that's understandable.
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.640]  You're a new grower.
[10:37.640 --> 10:39.280]  You don't have a budget to allocate to growing.
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.520]  You got a family, you got a life.
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.520]  I'm learned to do chemicals, learn to take a nutrients.
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.520]  Not going to do that.
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.680]  We just want to avoid the word chemicals.
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.840]  But yeah, chemicals is a scary word.
[10:48.840 --> 10:49.840]  Nutrients.
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.920]  I steered clear of miracle glow East coast because we try to, when you harvest this,
[10:54.920 --> 10:59.800]  try to either, if you have a patient friend that needs some medicine or I don't know the
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.920]  fucking straight way to do that, but save the money that you normally would have gone
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.120]  to your caregiver or your dispensary, save that money next year because you're going
[11:06.120 --> 11:10.400]  to have your own pot because you're growing it and buy those bottles that you could not
[11:10.400 --> 11:11.400]  get this year.
[11:11.400 --> 11:14.800]  You have to make your shit a little bit better next year and then the next year and a little
[11:14.800 --> 11:15.800]  bit better.
[11:15.800 --> 11:18.880]  And then every, then by the time you're just an amateur grower, you don't need the fucking
[11:18.880 --> 11:20.440]  rockstar drum set yet.
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.960]  By the time you're a good rockstar, you'll have a rockstar set up.
[11:22.960 --> 11:23.960]  You'll know what you're doing.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  So it's easier to learn.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  I think piece by piece.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.120]  I became a good grower because I started with struggle, bud.
[11:28.120 --> 11:30.880]  You know, I started with the shitty setup and was like, no, this sucks.
[11:30.880 --> 11:34.200]  And then had to grow a whole crop through that because you don't want to rebuild your
[11:34.200 --> 11:38.400]  room in the middle of a grow and then bought the next upgrade and then realized I've never
[11:38.400 --> 11:39.400]  had a room.
[11:39.400 --> 11:43.840]  I've always had like a small box with plants in it and then now it's outdoors.
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.200]  So you were never in a state where you could just go to the grow shop and be like, I need
[11:47.200 --> 11:48.200]  this.
[11:48.200 --> 11:49.200]  Yeah.
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.200]  We could walk in.
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.200]  We, it almost feels like we're cheating.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.200]  It's almost too easy.
[11:52.200 --> 11:53.200]  It is cheating.
[11:53.440 --> 11:54.440]  Yeah.
[11:54.440 --> 11:55.440]  It's almost too easy.
[11:55.440 --> 11:56.440]  All right.
[11:56.440 --> 11:57.440]  Let's go back to top dressing with mulch.
[11:57.440 --> 12:00.680]  You should be hooking them up with your full bloom feed.
[12:00.680 --> 12:04.800]  Like you were saying, pull back on the nitrogen, get your phosphorus and potassium in there
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.800]  heavily.
[12:05.800 --> 12:06.800]  For sure.
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.400]  Um, so you're mulching your, uh, explain that to the guys that like, fuck, I'll tell
[12:11.400 --> 12:12.400]  you I'm retarded on mulching.
[12:12.400 --> 12:14.200]  I know how to mulch my yard and my trees outside.
[12:14.200 --> 12:16.680]  What are we using for mulch for our weed plants?
[12:16.680 --> 12:19.920]  Um, I've been using a fresh green matter.
[12:20.040 --> 12:27.280]  Um, most of it's from the plant itself, the leaves, um, and weed seedlings I've been pulling
[12:27.280 --> 12:28.280]  up.
[12:28.280 --> 12:32.960]  Um, and then also I've been, well, I've been mixing that with straw.
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.160]  Um, that's been composted.
[12:35.160 --> 12:41.840]  Um, and I'm, you know, I'm building a mulch mound, uh, around the plants is probably eight,
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.600]  10 inches tall.
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.440]  Um, and the circumference of the, uh, um, yeah, yeah.
[12:48.760 --> 12:51.560]  A picture in a coffee can is kind of what I see.
[12:51.560 --> 12:52.560]  Coffee can for sure.
[12:52.560 --> 12:54.880]  Well, I mean, it's a, it's a fricking mound, man.
[12:54.880 --> 12:55.880]  Okay.
[12:55.880 --> 12:57.360]  I mean, um, yeah, no, it's pretty good.
[12:57.360 --> 13:00.880]  You know, maybe closer like 10 or 12 inches in the center.
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.280]  And then we're, we're coming out probably two feet circumference.
[13:05.280 --> 13:12.840]  But um, when I've removed part of the, to apply top dressing, um, the root growth that
[13:12.840 --> 13:15.680]  I've seen, um, is just phenomenal.
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.440]  Um, the soil just looks better.
[13:19.440 --> 13:20.440]  It looks happier.
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.920]  Um, it's not as tight as it normally gets when it's getting sunbaked.
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.480]  Um, and you know, I've always topped or mulched a little bit, but never to this extent.
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.880]  I've just, uh, so in nature, wouldn't leaves fall off of a plant and kind of decompose
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.920]  for where the plant's growing and provide that nutrient for next year.
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.960]  So that makes a lot of great sense.
[13:39.960 --> 13:40.960]  Here's my question.
[13:40.960 --> 13:42.640]  Do you ever worry about heat with that?
[13:42.640 --> 13:43.640]  No, no.
[13:43.640 --> 13:49.240]  Um, I, I mean, I did initially cause I mean, yeah, yeah.
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.480]  Um, but, uh, that's why I've always kind of steered away from it.
[13:53.480 --> 14:00.240]  Um, but doing the big mound with, you know, um, it's just, it's worked great.
[14:00.240 --> 14:04.040]  You know, it'll be dry on top, but as I worked down into it, I've looked for something to
[14:04.040 --> 14:10.640]  keep the heat off my soil because my soil is just baked and I tried sand because somebody
[14:10.640 --> 14:12.720]  was like, I'll just put a layer of sand on there.
[14:12.720 --> 14:18.760]  And I went out there and my plants were like, don't, don't do you sent?
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.760]  Yeah.
[14:19.760 --> 14:20.760]  Yeah.
[14:20.760 --> 14:22.560]  Don't you say you can get rid of your dirt bugs with sand.
[14:22.560 --> 14:24.760]  If you do it, use a really tiny, tiny layer.
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.960]  Just make some diet donations, reapply it every single time after you water.
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.960]  It's a gigantic.
[14:32.960 --> 14:35.800]  So it looks like, uh, we've kind of worked over to one of the things that we wrote down
[14:35.800 --> 14:36.800]  to talk about watering.
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.320]  If you're out door growing, it's been 90 something degrees in Pueblo, Colorado.
[14:42.320 --> 14:43.320]  How much water?
[14:43.320 --> 14:44.320]  Okay.
[14:44.320 --> 14:45.320]  Adam, I'll ask you first.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.360]  Cause Jesse's going to have a lot to say.
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.600]  You're kind of a new guy.
[14:47.600 --> 14:49.000]  What size are your pots?
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  Five gallon.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.720]  Uh, your plants from what I see look to be about four feet tall.
[14:52.720 --> 14:54.360]  Uh, one's four foot.
[14:54.360 --> 14:56.000]  The other two are right at my chin.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  So about five foot.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  Okay.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  I'm just looking at pictures on Facebook.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Guys haven't gone over there and looked.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  I don't want to spider mites.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Yeah.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  I'm just kidding.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  No, it's fine.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  That's a gardener joke.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  You guys will, you guys will razzle.
[15:06.200 --> 15:07.200]  There you go.
[15:07.200 --> 15:08.200]  There you go.
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.880]  He does not have bugs only in his hair.
[15:09.880 --> 15:10.880]  Yep.
[15:10.880 --> 15:11.880]  All right.
[15:11.880 --> 15:12.880]  Only the beneficial kind.
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.400]  You got four foot tall plants and five gallon pots.
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.200]  How often and how much are you watering those girls?
[15:19.200 --> 15:26.440]  Every day before the sun comes up, getting the hose out and literally filling it up to
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.820]  the top three different times.
[15:28.820 --> 15:32.760]  By the end of the day, they are dry and I can pick them up with one hand.
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.760]  Wow.
[15:33.760 --> 15:34.760]  Wow.
[15:34.760 --> 15:35.760]  So you guys got to get on it.
[15:36.520 --> 15:37.520]  You got to get on the water.
[15:37.520 --> 15:38.520]  Every single day.
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.520]  And if you think, Oh, I'll just wait until noon.
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.520]  No, you won't.
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.360]  You will go out there and they will be sad pieces of lump and you'll be like, Oh my God,
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.360]  what have I done?
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.360]  Yeah.
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.680]  I've waited until nine or 10 and went out there and they're screaming for water.
[15:50.680 --> 15:52.880]  So water your plants.
[15:52.880 --> 15:53.880]  Water your plants.
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.800]  Uh, try a wrap and some white plastic around them.
[15:56.800 --> 15:57.800]  Okay.
[15:57.800 --> 15:58.800]  Yeah.
[15:58.800 --> 15:59.800]  White plastic.
[15:59.800 --> 16:00.800]  Sure.
[16:00.800 --> 16:01.800]  It'll reflect the heat instead of retain it.
[16:01.800 --> 16:02.800]  Okay.
[16:02.800 --> 16:03.800]  And get you a big good size mulch going.
[16:03.800 --> 16:04.800]  All right.
[16:04.840 --> 16:06.600]  Um, another thing about the mulch.
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.160]  Um, I just pulled a whole bunch of weeds out of my yard.
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.240]  They were tall and atrocious.
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.120]  Could I just throw them in a, in a bucket and start mulching them?
[16:14.120 --> 16:15.120]  I'm worried about bugs.
[16:15.120 --> 16:16.120]  You know what I'm saying?
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.960]  I mean, yeah, that, um, the plant matter I can definitely work with, you know, like I'd
[16:20.960 --> 16:23.000]  be a little nervous about that.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Okay.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.640]  Um, so don't just grab any weeds and start mulching it.
[16:26.640 --> 16:27.640]  Yeah.
[16:27.640 --> 16:28.640]  Yeah.
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.680]  Like, um, I'm, you know, select about my, my weeds are actually morning glory seeds.
[16:33.680 --> 16:40.480]  So, and if anyone knows anything about morning glory, yeah, highly, highly invasive.
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.700]  So it's easy to find, but so how much water, sorry, how big are your plants outdoors?
[16:45.700 --> 16:48.320]  Can I even ask you to, I can avoid questions you don't want to answer.
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.480]  We're doing like a, a six to eight foot.
[16:52.480 --> 16:56.640]  Um, each one's probably minimum of four foot in circumference.
[16:56.640 --> 17:02.720]  So, um, they're the three of us to put our arms together, look good around it.
[17:02.760 --> 17:03.760]  Yeah.
[17:03.760 --> 17:04.760]  Yeah.
[17:04.760 --> 17:05.760]  This stocks as big as that water bottle.
[17:05.760 --> 17:06.760]  Yeah.
[17:06.760 --> 17:08.480]  I've seen pictures of the stocks are as big as my forearm.
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.480]  Yeah.
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.200]  Coming out of the ground is actually, yeah, it's pretty gnarly moved from plants.
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.640]  So shrubs, how much, uh, how much water does a plant that size take every day?
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.280]  Seven and a half to 10 gallons a day.
[17:21.280 --> 17:22.280]  Wow.
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.280]  Times.
[17:23.280 --> 17:24.600]  However many plants he's got, we won't even go there.
[17:24.600 --> 17:27.600]  So you got a chlorinated where I was headed.
[17:27.600 --> 17:29.420]  Exactly what I was headed to.
[17:29.420 --> 17:33.700]  It's gotta be hauled in somewhere if you're out in a rural area, because there's not enough
[17:33.700 --> 17:34.700]  water to do that.
[17:34.700 --> 17:38.020]  If you're just coming out of your well, sometimes you don't want to drain the well, you gotta
[17:38.020 --> 17:39.020]  have water for your life.
[17:39.020 --> 17:40.020]  The picture neighbors off real good too.
[17:40.020 --> 17:45.300]  I didn't even think of that shit, man.
[17:45.300 --> 17:49.020]  And then the federal government regulates most wells.
[17:49.020 --> 17:51.180]  So yeah, they can't know that you're there.
[17:51.180 --> 17:53.740]  Real understanding of pot grows as I understand it.
[17:53.740 --> 17:56.860]  So they're real inviting for that sort of thing.
[17:56.860 --> 17:59.340]  All right.
[17:59.340 --> 18:00.540]  So we've covered a lot about water.
[18:00.540 --> 18:02.580]  Oh man, there was a hum and I just found it.
[18:02.580 --> 18:03.820]  There was a squeal in my headphones.
[18:03.820 --> 18:06.820]  I hope it only happened in my ears, but it went blah, blah, blah, just a minute ago.
[18:06.820 --> 18:09.460]  I was my headphone could have been my head.
[18:09.460 --> 18:10.540]  All right.
[18:10.540 --> 18:12.740]  So yeah, that's something we talked about a few episodes ago.
[18:12.740 --> 18:16.740]  Uh, the federal government is banning fucking water use for dispensaries and grows, which,
[18:16.740 --> 18:21.180]  uh, if they catch, if a federal agent, federal agent, if somebody for like the department
[18:21.180 --> 18:25.380]  of waterworks or somebody, some of them that works in a federal agency discovers water
[18:25.380 --> 18:29.540]  in their municipality being used for a cannabis grow, they're supposed to report the cannabis
[18:29.540 --> 18:30.540]  grow in the water.
[18:30.540 --> 18:32.540]  That's something we talked about a few episodes ago.
[18:32.540 --> 18:33.700]  Whack shit.
[18:33.700 --> 18:34.700]  Be careful.
[18:34.700 --> 18:35.700]  You guys be super careful.
[18:35.700 --> 18:38.100]  Uh, try to be super discreet.
[18:38.100 --> 18:39.100]  All right.
[18:39.100 --> 18:41.820]  Uh, we talked a little bit about worms.
[18:41.820 --> 18:45.020]  You were saying that the worms were crawling up into your mulch.
[18:45.020 --> 18:46.020]  Yeah.
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.020]  Yeah.
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.020]  That's crazy.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.020]  That means happy mulch.
[18:49.020 --> 18:50.020]  Yeah.
[18:50.020 --> 18:51.020]  Uh, the worms get up there.
[18:51.020 --> 18:52.020]  They're probably eating those leaves.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.020]  Yeah.
[18:53.020 --> 18:55.860]  They're probably secreting their enzymes all over those leaves.
[18:55.860 --> 19:01.220]  Uh, those leaves are breaking down and becoming nutrients, uh, that are more bioavailable
[19:01.220 --> 19:02.220]  to the plants.
[19:02.220 --> 19:04.260]  So that's a win-win situation for everybody.
[19:04.260 --> 19:05.260]  Yeah.
[19:05.260 --> 19:06.260]  Do you guys hear that?
[19:06.260 --> 19:07.260]  Nope.
[19:07.260 --> 19:08.260]  Okay.
[19:08.260 --> 19:09.260]  It's just my headphones or something.
[19:09.260 --> 19:12.260]  No, it's like digital sound in my ear.
[19:12.260 --> 19:14.260]  It sounds like a telegraph.
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.260]  There's a fan on or something.
[19:15.260 --> 19:16.260]  I wasn't sure.
[19:16.260 --> 19:17.260]  Digital noise.
[19:17.260 --> 19:18.260]  Sorry guys.
[19:18.260 --> 19:19.260]  I'm tripping out over here.
[19:19.260 --> 19:21.660]  I don't like the sound of part of this equipment.
[19:21.660 --> 19:22.660]  Oh no.
[19:23.300 --> 19:24.300]  It's gone.
[19:24.300 --> 19:25.300]  Yeah.
[19:25.300 --> 19:26.940]  It's this, uh, H A O four from live wire solutions.
[19:26.940 --> 19:28.460]  I've talked about it on the show before.
[19:28.460 --> 19:29.460]  Fuck this thing.
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.460]  Yeah.
[19:30.460 --> 19:31.460]  That's what's failing.
[19:31.460 --> 19:32.460]  It's out now for me.
[19:32.460 --> 19:33.460]  Is it out completely?
[19:33.460 --> 19:34.460]  Yep.
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.460]  How about now?
[19:35.460 --> 19:36.460]  There you go.
[19:36.460 --> 19:37.460]  All right guys.
[19:37.460 --> 19:38.460]  Oh, it sounds better in mind too.
[19:38.460 --> 19:39.460]  Hey, cool.
[19:39.460 --> 19:40.460]  Cool.
[19:40.460 --> 19:41.460]  Things works.
[19:41.460 --> 19:42.460]  I'm Hey, whatever channel I'm on solid.
[19:42.460 --> 19:43.460]  Nice.
[19:43.460 --> 19:44.460]  Channel one.
[19:44.460 --> 19:45.460]  Yeah.
[19:45.460 --> 19:46.460]  Never did nothing throughout that.
[19:46.460 --> 19:47.460]  Uh, sorry.
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.460]  You had to listen to that.
[19:48.460 --> 19:49.460]  This headphone app sucks.
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.460]  Don't ever buy it.
[19:50.460 --> 19:51.460]  I will not say the name of the company one more time.
[19:52.260 --> 19:54.980]  H A O four, four channel stereo headphone amplifier.
[19:54.980 --> 19:56.940]  Don't buy that thing.
[19:56.940 --> 19:59.180]  That's my anti-sponsor right there.
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.060]  You guys keep saying, won't you buy something better?
[20:01.060 --> 20:03.380]  Uh, well I bought this one and it keeps breaking.
[20:03.380 --> 20:07.180]  So I go to guitar center and I say this thing broke again and they just give me another one
[20:07.180 --> 20:08.180]  of the same thing.
[20:08.180 --> 20:12.860]  So it just costs me a trip to guitar center every few weeks, which you know, they're cool
[20:12.860 --> 20:14.260]  over there and I always find new toys.
[20:14.260 --> 20:16.820]  So what the hell let's do it.
[20:16.820 --> 20:17.820]  Hopefully the company goes out of business.
[20:17.820 --> 20:19.620]  Then you get an upgrade.
[20:19.620 --> 20:20.620]  There you go.
[20:20.780 --> 20:25.500]  Now you're thinking early some store credit on an upgrade or something.
[20:25.500 --> 20:26.500]  Yeah.
[20:26.500 --> 20:27.500]  That's just random talk guys.
[20:27.500 --> 20:29.220]  I hope you enjoy hearing us talk about random shit.
[20:29.220 --> 20:31.260]  I get messages that are like, just hang out and talk.
[20:31.260 --> 20:32.260]  We love hearing you talk.
[20:32.260 --> 20:33.260]  So that was some of that.
[20:33.260 --> 20:36.860]  You probably want to hear me talk about weed and not my piece of shit equipment, but that's
[20:36.860 --> 20:37.860]  all right.
[20:37.860 --> 20:39.940]  Uh, so worms, yeah, worms are awesome.
[20:39.940 --> 20:42.100]  Put worms by the roots of your plants all the time.
[20:42.100 --> 20:43.100]  That's good stuff.
[20:43.100 --> 20:44.100]  Yeah.
[20:44.100 --> 20:47.020]  Hey, and if you find a worm, don't bury it.
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.820]  That's not how that works.
[20:48.820 --> 20:49.820]  Okay.
[20:50.020 --> 20:52.860]  Let me re explain that and not stone or talk it.
[20:52.860 --> 20:58.900]  If you find a worm and you want to put it into your plant, um, don't bury it.
[20:58.900 --> 21:04.980]  Gently put him on the surface and work in his way down or it's way in there.
[21:04.980 --> 21:06.620]  So I'm sure yours are in the ground.
[21:06.620 --> 21:10.820]  So finding worms in your plants are one thing, but should I go out and get some worms?
[21:10.820 --> 21:15.300]  Would that be beneficial at the beginning of, you know, when I first put the plant out
[21:15.300 --> 21:16.300]  there?
[21:16.300 --> 21:17.860]  I don't think it would hurt.
[21:17.860 --> 21:18.860]  Okay.
[21:18.900 --> 21:21.540]  So that's a, you're feeding bottled nutrients.
[21:21.540 --> 21:23.420]  There's a lot of acids and salts in what you're feeding.
[21:23.420 --> 21:29.780]  They're going to wreak havoc on your, on your inadvertently had, uh, worms in indoor plants
[21:29.780 --> 21:31.380]  before, but never purposely.
[21:31.380 --> 21:35.100]  So, uh, how about growing mushrooms in your soil on accident?
[21:35.100 --> 21:36.580]  Those yellow mushrooms pop up.
[21:36.580 --> 21:40.140]  I see a lot of that in Colorado because of the weird climate changes.
[21:40.140 --> 21:41.140]  Yeah.
[21:41.140 --> 21:44.860]  I got some crazy grow, grow, Kashi compost going on right now.
[21:44.860 --> 21:47.180]  That's about to start doing some mushrooms.
[21:47.180 --> 21:48.180]  Nice.
[21:48.500 --> 21:52.980]  Shout out to the probiotic farmers alliance, gauge green genetics, key play big, big love
[21:52.980 --> 21:53.980]  to all those guys.
[21:53.980 --> 21:56.580]  I think I'm really, really stoked about this stuff.
[21:56.580 --> 21:58.980]  All of the stuff they grow with that looks great.
[21:58.980 --> 22:00.220]  Looks amazing.
[22:00.220 --> 22:04.740]  You know, uh, I've been talking with Jesse a lot about farming and stuff and, uh, talking
[22:04.740 --> 22:08.980]  to not talking to, but listening to a guy named Jim Frere on Facebook.
[22:08.980 --> 22:10.620]  He's a excellent grower.
[22:10.620 --> 22:11.780]  He's he's a scientist, dude.
[22:11.780 --> 22:12.780]  He's awesome.
[22:12.780 --> 22:14.060]  He's a organic chemistry guy.
[22:14.060 --> 22:17.980]  He knows a lot of things, uh, between all you organic farmers and you outdoor guys,
[22:17.980 --> 22:19.580]  I need a compost pile.
[22:19.580 --> 22:24.740]  I'm a vegetarian and I'm over there chopping up pineapple, watermelon, strawberries, kale,
[22:24.740 --> 22:28.980]  lettuce, onions, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, whatever else you brought me today.
[22:28.980 --> 22:32.620]  I didn't even get to look into the bag far enough, but I chop up all that.
[22:32.620 --> 22:35.940]  And every one of those has a piece that you chop off and don't eat.
[22:35.940 --> 22:36.940]  You know what I mean?
[22:36.940 --> 22:39.900]  That little part where the stem comes out or the little tip that's funky for sure.
[22:39.900 --> 22:40.900]  Bananas have appeal.
[22:40.900 --> 22:42.100]  My avocado, I eat a ton of avocados.
[22:42.100 --> 22:43.100]  They all have appeal.
[22:43.100 --> 22:45.340]  They always have some shitty Brown spot in them.
[22:45.900 --> 22:49.140]  Instead of throw that in the damn trash, I need a compost pile for all of that.
[22:49.140 --> 22:51.700]  No, just try the, uh, the girl Kashi.
[22:51.700 --> 22:54.780]  Just, um, what I've been doing is just a bucket.
[22:54.780 --> 22:57.300]  Um, I've got one right now.
[22:57.300 --> 23:01.140]  It's just all veggie scraps, which would be all greens.
[23:01.140 --> 23:04.940]  Um, I've got another one I'm doing started a little earlier.
[23:04.940 --> 23:06.980]  It's half carbon, half greens.
[23:06.980 --> 23:09.220]  Um, explain the carbon to the retards.
[23:09.220 --> 23:10.220]  No, I'm sorry.
[23:10.220 --> 23:11.220]  I said retards.
[23:11.220 --> 23:12.220]  Cause it was me.
[23:12.220 --> 23:13.220]  Sorry.
[23:13.220 --> 23:14.220]  I'm sorry.
[23:14.220 --> 23:15.220]  I'm sorry.
[23:15.220 --> 23:16.300]  Green greens are living things.
[23:16.300 --> 23:20.540]  Carbon would be like, um, uh, peat moss.
[23:20.540 --> 23:24.860]  I suppose would be carbon, uh, coconut or cocoa shell.
[23:24.860 --> 23:32.820]  Um, dried up sticks, dried up leaves, peanut shells, egg shells, um, but you have to have
[23:32.820 --> 23:36.980]  a 50 50 mixture where you don't have to have, but to get a deal.
[23:36.980 --> 23:37.980]  Yeah.
[23:37.980 --> 23:38.980]  To get it.
[23:38.980 --> 23:39.980]  Yeah.
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.980]  All right.
[23:40.980 --> 23:46.300]  So I've got, um, a third cup, a third of a cup of grow Kashi mix that fucker in there.
[23:46.300 --> 23:47.700]  Threw it away.
[23:47.700 --> 23:48.900]  Uh, six days later.
[23:48.900 --> 23:53.140]  I mean, I can visually see stuff turning into humate, you know?
[23:53.140 --> 23:54.140]  Wow.
[23:54.140 --> 23:55.140]  Yeah.
[23:55.140 --> 23:56.620]  It's a web of life in there.
[23:56.620 --> 23:57.620]  Oh, big time.
[23:57.620 --> 23:58.620]  Oh, big time.
[23:58.620 --> 23:59.620]  Okay.
[23:59.620 --> 24:04.380]  Uh, can you send one to my phone and then let me tweet that from the show stuff for
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.380]  sure.
[24:05.380 --> 24:07.180]  I'm going to totally tweet Jesse's pick.
[24:07.180 --> 24:08.180]  I'm writing it.
[24:08.180 --> 24:14.420]  I've tried lots of different styles of composting before, and this is hands down the easiest.
[24:14.420 --> 24:15.420]  Yeah.
[24:15.420 --> 24:16.420]  That sounds like it's right up my alley.
[24:16.420 --> 24:17.420]  I'm super stoked.
[24:17.420 --> 24:19.220]  Cause I'll be able to have fresh compost all through the winter.
[24:19.220 --> 24:21.660]  I can, can I put carrots and shit in there?
[24:21.660 --> 24:22.660]  Oh yeah.
[24:22.660 --> 24:23.660]  Okay.
[24:23.660 --> 24:25.460]  Oh, that soil is ready to grow some shit, dude.
[24:25.460 --> 24:26.460]  Oh man.
[24:26.460 --> 24:29.860]  And just, and then just add that to my root organic base.
[24:29.860 --> 24:30.860]  Yeah.
[24:30.860 --> 24:31.860]  I'm going to let it go for like a month.
[24:31.860 --> 24:34.420]  It's kind of what I was reading from this guy.
[24:34.420 --> 24:35.420]  Yeah.
[24:35.420 --> 24:39.860]  Almost sifted out if it needs to be, which is like a quarter inch screen.
[24:39.860 --> 24:43.940]  Um, you just take it all, dump it on there, sift it through.
[24:43.940 --> 24:47.260]  It'll catch anything that's not composted yet.
[24:47.260 --> 24:49.420]  And then everything that comes through is bam.
[24:49.420 --> 24:52.780]  It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful compost.
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.780]  That's a good idea.
[24:53.780 --> 24:54.780]  You guys, I'm sold on that.
[24:54.780 --> 24:58.660]  That was a quick rundown and I'm sold on that two, five gallon buckets and some table scraps
[24:58.660 --> 25:01.860]  and a bag of grow Kashi and you're making awesome compost.
[25:01.860 --> 25:02.860]  Yeah.
[25:02.860 --> 25:03.860]  Let's see.
[25:03.860 --> 25:06.140]  I got a picture of a, this was day one.
[25:06.140 --> 25:07.940]  It's a bunch of celery.
[25:07.940 --> 25:09.900]  Some coffee grounds are carbon too.
[25:09.900 --> 25:10.900]  Okay.
[25:10.900 --> 25:11.900]  Looks like some asparagus maybe in there.
[25:11.900 --> 25:13.420]  She drinks coffee so that would.
[25:13.420 --> 25:15.940]  Maybe some asparagus in there or something like that.
[25:15.940 --> 25:19.660]  So I'm a vegetarian and almost everything I eat could go in.
[25:19.660 --> 25:20.660]  Yeah.
[25:20.660 --> 25:21.660]  Yeah.
[25:21.660 --> 25:22.660]  And I've just, you always got something.
[25:22.660 --> 25:23.660]  Yeah.
[25:23.660 --> 25:25.700]  There's always, watermelon has a rind.
[25:25.700 --> 25:27.700]  Strawberries have that little green thing at the tip.
[25:27.700 --> 25:29.860]  Everything's got something, some sort of waste to it.
[25:29.860 --> 25:30.860]  Bananas have a peel.
[25:30.860 --> 25:31.860]  Like I was saying.
[25:31.860 --> 25:34.740]  You know, we all eat the vine at some point and we're usually where it comes off the vine.
[25:34.740 --> 25:36.740]  We as Americans don't eat that part.
[25:36.740 --> 25:37.740]  Yeah.
[25:37.740 --> 25:38.740]  Yeah.
[25:38.740 --> 25:39.740]  Nigerian meme.
[25:39.740 --> 25:40.740]  Yeah.
[25:40.740 --> 25:44.140]  You could even experiment with some, you know, scraps from different grows and stuff like
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.140]  that.
[25:45.140 --> 25:46.140]  So yeah.
[25:46.140 --> 25:47.140]  Clean leaves.
[25:47.140 --> 25:48.140]  Good clean leaves.
[25:48.140 --> 25:49.740]  Old stems could be my, my fiber part.
[25:49.740 --> 25:50.740]  My carbon part.
[25:50.740 --> 25:51.740]  For sure.
[25:51.740 --> 25:52.740]  Awesome.
[25:52.740 --> 25:53.740]  That's a great idea, man.
[25:53.740 --> 25:54.740]  You guys just learned something with me.
[25:54.740 --> 25:55.740]  I'm glad we could all learn that together.
[25:55.740 --> 25:58.420]  I would guess that's what you do with your fan leaves too at the end.
[25:58.420 --> 25:59.420]  Yeah.
[25:59.420 --> 26:00.420]  That's what I do for sure.
[26:00.420 --> 26:01.420]  Yeah.
[26:01.980 --> 26:03.580]  I also have another way of composting.
[26:03.580 --> 26:07.580]  This is actually the easiest way of composting I've ever discovered.
[26:07.580 --> 26:09.780]  I feed it to my chickens.
[26:09.780 --> 26:12.460]  So yeah, but not everyone has that luxury.
[26:12.460 --> 26:14.460]  They shoot it out at high nutrient levels.
[26:14.460 --> 26:15.460]  Yeah.
[26:15.460 --> 26:16.460]  All right.
[26:16.460 --> 26:17.460]  What was I about to say?
[26:17.460 --> 26:18.460]  Oh, I don't even remember.
[26:18.460 --> 26:22.660]  There were so many things happening to my brain just now.
[26:22.660 --> 26:23.660]  That's a lot.
[26:23.660 --> 26:24.660]  Let's get back on topic here.
[26:24.660 --> 26:25.660]  Snots berries taste like what?
[26:25.660 --> 26:26.660]  They taste like snozzberries, man.
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.660]  Snogs.
[26:27.660 --> 26:28.660]  Yeah.
[26:28.900 --> 26:36.300]  All the stuff we're eating, we should think about what we put into ourselves because that's
[26:36.300 --> 26:38.780]  what we should be feeding our plants kind of the same way.
[26:38.780 --> 26:41.220]  You don't want to feed your plants watermelons, but think about what's in.
[26:41.220 --> 26:42.220]  Yeah.
[26:42.220 --> 26:43.220]  Think about your health.
[26:43.220 --> 26:44.220]  Think about your plant health.
[26:44.220 --> 26:45.220]  It's all the same shit.
[26:45.220 --> 26:48.940]  Once you start paying attention, you'll match up and you'll start feeling better.
[26:48.940 --> 26:49.940]  You'll definitely pay attention.
[26:49.940 --> 26:56.220]  I noticed that from the last show that you were here and you said, we go out and we spend
[26:56.220 --> 27:00.780]  money on expensive bud and expensive water and then we just put 99 cents.
[27:00.780 --> 27:02.460]  I'm the worst at that, dude.
[27:02.460 --> 27:04.020]  I'm a cheeseburger fanatic.
[27:04.020 --> 27:10.620]  So I told her straight up after that, go get meals, go make food.
[27:10.620 --> 27:11.620]  For sure.
[27:11.620 --> 27:12.620]  That's it.
[27:12.620 --> 27:13.620]  It's fun.
[27:13.620 --> 27:17.420]  I mean, me and my wife cook together.
[27:17.420 --> 27:18.420]  I didn't go that far.
[27:18.420 --> 27:19.420]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[27:19.420 --> 27:20.420]  She loves to cook.
[27:20.420 --> 27:21.420]  Get in the kitchen and cook, bro.
[27:21.420 --> 27:22.420]  Don't give her ideas.
[27:22.420 --> 27:23.420]  You shut your mouth.
[27:23.420 --> 27:24.420]  Get in the kitchen and cook, bro.
[27:24.420 --> 27:25.420]  It's fun.
[27:25.620 --> 27:28.380]  I cooked lunch with a little lady today and it was a great time.
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.900]  I cook for her sometimes.
[27:29.900 --> 27:33.020]  Usually she can't make bacon the best, but you know what I'm saying?
[27:33.020 --> 27:34.020]  See, well that's your job.
[27:34.020 --> 27:35.460]  Then get in there and you make the bacon.
[27:35.460 --> 27:36.460]  That's why they say it.
[27:36.460 --> 27:37.460]  Making bacon.
[27:37.460 --> 27:38.460]  Making the bacon.
[27:38.460 --> 27:39.460]  Yep.
[27:39.460 --> 27:40.460]  Yep.
[27:40.460 --> 27:41.460]  All right.
[27:41.460 --> 27:42.460]  Let's get back on track maybe a little bit.
[27:42.460 --> 27:43.460]  A little bit.
[27:43.460 --> 27:44.460]  But I don't know.
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.460]  It's my show.
[27:45.460 --> 27:46.460]  We can do whatever we want.
[27:46.460 --> 27:47.460]  I was following you.
[27:47.460 --> 27:50.500]  I mean, I agree with you, but I mean, we don't have to get back on track at all.
[27:50.500 --> 27:51.500]  You know what?
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.060]  So let's talk more about bacon.
[27:53.060 --> 27:54.060]  You seen any good cartoons lately?
[27:54.060 --> 27:55.060]  No.
[27:55.700 --> 27:59.500]  Rick and Morty is great, but I'm not aware of Rick and Morty.
[27:59.500 --> 28:01.020]  Oh, that show is so bizarre.
[28:01.020 --> 28:07.020]  Dude, if you want to say, try to get drinking and driving is cool off to children.
[28:07.020 --> 28:10.420]  Oh, you've told me about this one where the guy's drinking constantly.
[28:10.420 --> 28:12.300]  He's flying a spaceship.
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.180]  Let's clarify that.
[28:14.180 --> 28:18.260]  It's like, okay, but he's slammed by the end of every show.
[28:18.260 --> 28:20.260]  Isn't everything just better?
[28:20.260 --> 28:21.260]  All right.
[28:21.260 --> 28:24.260]  We're hitting flour hard.
[28:24.460 --> 28:26.420]  Our plants are in flour.
[28:26.420 --> 28:27.420]  We're showing the fuzzies.
[28:27.420 --> 28:28.420]  We've pulled our males.
[28:28.420 --> 28:29.420]  We've top dressed.
[28:29.420 --> 28:31.220]  Our worms are happy.
[28:31.220 --> 28:33.340]  We've switched to full bloom nutrients.
[28:33.340 --> 28:34.340]  You're feeding.
[28:34.340 --> 28:40.180]  If you're feeding bottle nutrients, go lightly on the nitrogen there, the grow or the bloom
[28:40.180 --> 28:41.180]  stuff.
[28:41.180 --> 28:46.020]  Now, if you're feeding teas and stuff, what should we be mixing into our teas at this
[28:46.020 --> 28:47.020]  time?
[28:47.020 --> 28:51.020]  Sea bird guano.
[28:51.020 --> 28:56.860]  That's pretty much where I get all my nitrogen for the bloom faced from.
[28:56.860 --> 29:00.980]  And then also most seabird guano is typically high NP.
[29:00.980 --> 29:01.980]  Literally.
[29:01.980 --> 29:02.980]  At least a little bit.
[29:02.980 --> 29:03.980]  Yeah.
[29:03.980 --> 29:04.980]  This show is way off track already today.
[29:04.980 --> 29:05.980]  This is awesome.
[29:05.980 --> 29:06.980]  All right.
[29:06.980 --> 29:14.380]  I should have known that was coming from the look on your face.
[29:14.380 --> 29:15.380]  We need a dab, I think.
[29:15.380 --> 29:17.660]  I'm going to get dabs going for everybody.
[29:17.660 --> 29:18.660]  So seabird guano.
[29:18.660 --> 29:20.900]  What else are you putting in there?
[29:21.780 --> 29:27.820]  I actually had a conversation with a gentleman about this earlier today.
[29:27.820 --> 29:31.300]  Was it Armando Vigil?
[29:31.300 --> 29:32.300]  Sure.
[29:32.300 --> 29:33.300]  Yeah.
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.300]  If you just want to throw him on blast like that.
[29:34.300 --> 29:35.300]  No, he's a cool guy.
[29:35.300 --> 29:36.300]  I'm going to actually not put him on blast.
[29:36.300 --> 29:37.860]  I want to give him a shout out.
[29:37.860 --> 29:38.860]  That dude listens to the show.
[29:38.860 --> 29:40.260]  He's a loyal listener.
[29:40.260 --> 29:42.300]  He's a shopper at High Grow Pueblo.
[29:42.300 --> 29:43.300]  Fuck yeah.
[29:43.300 --> 29:45.140]  So that's a lot of support.
[29:45.140 --> 29:47.020]  He shops at the stores I recommend.
[29:47.020 --> 29:48.820]  He buys the seeds I recommend.
[29:48.820 --> 29:50.460]  He grows products I recommend.
[29:51.020 --> 29:55.340]  He listens to your advice to the fucking word, bro.
[29:55.340 --> 29:59.140]  He wants to do exactly what he knows that success is proven and he wants to do what
[29:59.140 --> 30:00.140]  we are doing.
[30:00.140 --> 30:01.540]  So he's a loyal listener.
[30:01.540 --> 30:02.540]  He's become my friend.
[30:02.540 --> 30:04.300]  He's going to come hang out with us the next time he's around.
[30:04.300 --> 30:06.660]  He lives a little bit away from here.
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.860]  He was messaging me the last time he was here, but I wasn't prepared.
[30:08.860 --> 30:11.940]  I was working and the phone was jingling away from my pocket.
[30:11.940 --> 30:12.940]  But for sure.
[30:12.940 --> 30:13.940]  Yeah.
[30:13.940 --> 30:14.940]  Next time we're going to hang out, bro.
[30:14.940 --> 30:15.940]  I look forward to hanging out with you.
[30:15.940 --> 30:16.940]  So shout out to Mr. Vigil.
[30:16.940 --> 30:17.940]  I'm pretty sure it's Armando Vigil.
[30:17.940 --> 30:18.940]  Yeah.
[30:18.940 --> 30:19.940]  Yeah.
[30:20.420 --> 30:21.420]  I get lost on names.
[30:21.420 --> 30:22.420]  I'm not even looking at a screen.
[30:22.420 --> 30:23.420]  So I'm 90% sure.
[30:23.420 --> 30:24.420]  I know it's Armando because that's just fun to say.
[30:24.420 --> 30:28.420]  I don't want to take a Mondo dab.
[30:28.420 --> 30:29.420]  An Armando.
[30:29.420 --> 30:34.020]  I'm going to make sure I'm saying your name right, bro, just because I'd feel like a dick
[30:34.020 --> 30:35.620]  if I'm all shot and not the wrong guy.
[30:35.620 --> 30:36.620]  We're going to go look right now.
[30:36.620 --> 30:37.620]  We're going to Facebook.
[30:37.620 --> 30:38.620]  I'm doing it.
[30:38.620 --> 30:42.620]  I'm going to get this out before I dab.
[30:42.620 --> 30:43.620]  Yeah.
[30:43.620 --> 30:48.340]  The Hypee bat guanos, if you got them.
[30:48.340 --> 30:49.820]  You know, that's, they're good.
[30:50.700 --> 30:51.700]  Not very sustainable.
[30:51.700 --> 30:56.700]  Any of those bad guanos really, really suck, but it is what it is.
[30:56.700 --> 31:01.700]  So don't, you know, not everyone's as conflicted as I am, I suppose.
[31:01.700 --> 31:03.700]  But I'm shouting out the right guy.
[31:03.700 --> 31:04.700]  Yeah.
[31:04.700 --> 31:05.700]  Nice.
[31:05.700 --> 31:06.700]  I'm happy now.
[31:06.700 --> 31:07.700]  Sweet.
[31:07.700 --> 31:13.700]  But yeah, switch to the Hypee and rock it out.
[31:13.700 --> 31:14.700]  Any molasses?
[31:14.700 --> 31:15.700]  Yeah.
[31:15.700 --> 31:16.700]  I always do.
[31:16.700 --> 31:17.700]  I always do molasses.
[31:18.580 --> 31:22.580]  Almost every feed in flower after day 21, I have molasses or something similar.
[31:22.580 --> 31:25.380]  Humboldt honey, the Mendocino honey.
[31:25.380 --> 31:28.660]  Those are, I like the humble because it's got the yucca extract in there.
[31:28.660 --> 31:31.140]  The Mendocino honey is dirt cheap.
[31:31.140 --> 31:32.140]  It's dirty cheap.
[31:32.140 --> 31:34.140]  There might be yucca extract in that one, but not as much.
[31:34.140 --> 31:38.380]  Oh, he's taking a pretty big dab right now.
[31:38.380 --> 31:39.380]  Carb cap if you want it.
[31:39.380 --> 31:40.380]  There you go.
[31:40.380 --> 31:41.380]  Yeah.
[31:41.380 --> 31:43.380]  I don't really know why you put it on that, but whatever.
[31:43.380 --> 31:45.540]  It was the type of shatter.
[31:45.540 --> 31:47.540]  It was just hard to pull it up with that other dabber.
[31:48.380 --> 31:49.380]  I needed the cutting edge on that one.
[31:49.380 --> 31:50.380]  Nice.
[31:50.380 --> 31:53.380]  Hey, TaskRock, shout out, brother.
[31:53.380 --> 31:55.380]  There it is.
[31:58.380 --> 32:01.380]  That completely made me forget what we were talking about.
[32:01.380 --> 32:02.380]  Good.
[32:02.380 --> 32:03.380]  Good.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.380]  Good.
[32:04.380 --> 32:05.380]  I hope the listeners are taking dabs with this.
[32:05.380 --> 32:06.380]  Fishbone meal.
[32:06.380 --> 32:07.380]  That's always high in P.
[32:07.380 --> 32:10.380]  That's some good stuff, too.
[32:10.380 --> 32:13.380]  And I always go with the kelp.
[32:13.380 --> 32:15.380]  I've noticed something.
[32:16.220 --> 32:18.220]  I wonder what's up with this.
[32:18.220 --> 32:25.220]  I've had some kelp that is 101, and then I just recently bought some kelp that is 001.
[32:25.220 --> 32:27.220]  It's the exact same strain.
[32:27.220 --> 32:33.220]  Or, you know, this is derived from, and it's that whatever strain that you always see.
[32:33.220 --> 32:37.220]  But, yeah, I wonder what's up with that.
[32:37.220 --> 32:39.220]  You know, I don't pay enough attention to the packaging.
[32:39.220 --> 32:41.220]  I should start looking at that one.
[32:41.220 --> 32:45.220]  There's certain things I never pay attention to because you know.
[32:46.060 --> 32:50.060]  The look on my face doesn't convey on a podcast, but I've got a very curious look now.
[32:50.060 --> 32:55.060]  Like, huh, did they make different packaging for different runs or because, you know, stuff like that.
[32:55.060 --> 32:57.060]  It was different companies, too.
[32:57.060 --> 33:01.060]  But still, I mean, where did the nitrogen come from all of a sudden?
[33:01.060 --> 33:03.060]  You know, or where did it go?
[33:03.060 --> 33:05.060]  It's supposed to be the same product.
[33:05.060 --> 33:07.060]  Just different testing calibrations.
[33:07.060 --> 33:08.060]  For sure.
[33:08.060 --> 33:09.060]  Yeah.
[33:09.060 --> 33:11.060]  Well, it's supposed to be standardized, though.
[33:11.060 --> 33:13.060]  Yeah, but a lot of shit is.
[33:13.060 --> 33:15.060]  A lot of shit is supposed to be standardized.
[33:15.900 --> 33:16.900]  All right, it's my turn.
[33:16.900 --> 33:17.900]  I'm going to take this big dab.
[33:17.900 --> 33:20.900]  I was going to give it to Adam, but I realized how big it is, and he doesn't want to do this.
[33:20.900 --> 33:22.900]  He doesn't do that sort of thing.
[33:22.900 --> 33:23.900]  Lightweight, homie.
[33:23.900 --> 33:25.900]  I should ask a question before I take a dab.
[33:25.900 --> 33:27.900]  I asked about tees.
[33:27.900 --> 33:29.900]  I asked about feeding.
[33:29.900 --> 33:32.900]  It's time to finally train those things, right?
[33:32.900 --> 33:37.900]  If we want to do any LST training or anything like that, we better do it before they start budding out like crazy.
[33:37.900 --> 33:39.900]  Give them some sticks to support themselves.
[33:39.900 --> 33:41.900]  I said support themselves.
[33:41.900 --> 33:43.900]  Support with two Ps.
[33:44.740 --> 33:46.740]  I guess I'm excited about this dab.
[33:46.740 --> 33:55.740]  So tell us about what we need to do, and then we will talk about, after that, we'll talk about problems to look for and the biggest fear of all gardeners.
[33:55.740 --> 33:57.740]  We'll talk about those two things.
[33:57.740 --> 33:59.740]  So I'm going to take a dab, and Jesse will talk.
[33:59.740 --> 34:01.740]  God.
[34:01.740 --> 34:03.740]  Now I feel like I'm on the spot.
[34:03.740 --> 34:04.740]  You are.
[34:04.740 --> 34:06.740]  I like how you got the mic right by your face, too.
[34:06.740 --> 34:07.740]  It's fucking awesome.
[34:07.740 --> 34:08.740]  We can hear you so well.
[34:08.740 --> 34:09.740]  Nice.
[34:09.740 --> 34:11.740]  Let's see.
[34:12.580 --> 34:14.580]  Fuck, I'm stoned.
[34:14.580 --> 34:16.580]  We're training.
[34:16.580 --> 34:30.580]  So if you got the bamboos, I kind of like to stick them in the ground at an angle, attach the plant at a lower angle on the bamboo so that it's still going past it.
[34:30.580 --> 34:34.580]  Are you angling in toward the pot or out from the center of the pot?
[34:34.580 --> 34:36.580]  Out from the pot.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.580]  Okay, I just wanted to clear that up.
[34:38.580 --> 34:40.580]  I see both methods.
[34:41.420 --> 34:53.420]  I like to start with the bud dangling above the bamboo, and that kind of gives it a chance to develop its girth, and then it's going to kind of fall towards the bamboo, and you wrap it up.
[34:53.420 --> 34:55.420]  Kind of predict where it's going to fall.
[34:55.420 --> 34:57.420]  Yeah.
[34:57.420 --> 34:59.420]  Also, I mean, just straight up bamboos.
[34:59.420 --> 35:03.420]  With outdoors, make sure you tie your plants in at least two places.
[35:04.260 --> 35:06.260]  The wind.
[35:06.260 --> 35:26.260]  Once you start pinning plants with bamboos and stakes and stuff like that, you know, this applies indoors, too, but make sure you get them tied up in two places real good so that anything doesn't break over.
[35:26.260 --> 35:28.260]  That was such a stone ramble.
[35:28.260 --> 35:30.260]  That was perfect.
[35:31.100 --> 35:35.100]  That's exactly what needed to be said while Adam and I both got to take a dab and kind of get our shit back together.
[35:35.100 --> 35:37.100]  I gave us big dabs.
[35:37.100 --> 35:42.100]  See, now I'm kind of new to the bamboo sticking just because I never had plants big enough to even need stuff like that.
[35:42.100 --> 35:44.100]  For sure.
[35:44.100 --> 35:46.100]  I kind of asked him.
[35:46.100 --> 35:48.100]  He told me the same thing the other day, and I asked him, you know, what's really the purpose of it?
[35:48.100 --> 35:50.100]  And he's like, you know, just to hold it there.
[35:50.100 --> 36:00.100]  Now I have a tomato cage, and I went out, and I purchased the only sticks that were because, you know, living here in Colorado, things are not quite as available as you think they would be.
[36:00.940 --> 36:02.940]  They were sold the fuck out.
[36:02.940 --> 36:10.940]  So I had to, you know, I got little ones with the little rings in them that I can just hold up my side because those are the only ones right now.
[36:10.940 --> 36:12.940]  And I figure I can just tie it with a loose string.
[36:12.940 --> 36:18.940]  I got some branches coming in, you know, just holding it up against the tomato cage.
[36:18.940 --> 36:22.940]  I mean, yeah, that sounds like it's working for you.
[36:23.780 --> 36:29.780]  If nothing else, you can, you know, at maybe an earlier stage, run them through the tomato cage or...
[36:29.780 --> 36:31.780]  Yeah, that's...
[36:31.780 --> 36:33.780]  The way you did it is perfect, though.
[36:33.780 --> 36:37.780]  The only thing that Adam did wrong is he tried to put the tomato cages on a little late, so he had to struggle with that.
[36:37.780 --> 36:39.780]  Next time I'll show you a really smooth trick.
[36:39.780 --> 36:43.780]  It just takes like a... I use a twisty tie or a fucking like a pipe cleaner.
[36:43.780 --> 36:45.780]  They're called fuzzy sticks.
[36:45.780 --> 36:50.780]  Just grab the plant from the bottom and go up, and then just tie that shit in a couple of spots, and then you get to slide the cage on.
[36:51.620 --> 36:54.620]  For the size cages I got, I think it was still a little too late for that,
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.620]  because I tried that trick when I went out and bought the last one, and it was just like, no, no, no.
[36:59.620 --> 37:02.620]  So I just stuck it down in the middle, and it kind of branched it all out.
[37:02.620 --> 37:03.620]  Yeah.
[37:03.620 --> 37:04.620]  There you go.
[37:04.620 --> 37:07.620]  You can also cut them open and then just wire them back together.
[37:07.620 --> 37:08.620]  See?
[37:08.620 --> 37:09.620]  Jesse's a thinker.
[37:09.620 --> 37:10.620]  Yeah.
[37:10.620 --> 37:11.620]  Jesse's a thinker.
[37:11.620 --> 37:12.620]  Didn't think about that.
[37:12.620 --> 37:19.620]  But next year I plan to have the small square fence lines around it, maybe.
[37:20.460 --> 37:21.460]  For sure.
[37:21.460 --> 37:25.460]  That's something that I've been seeing a lot lately on YouTubes.
[37:25.460 --> 37:27.460]  Yeah, that's what I do.
[37:27.460 --> 37:28.460]  So...
[37:28.460 --> 37:33.460]  I actually, tomorrow, have to try to put one on one of those monsters.
[37:33.460 --> 37:34.460]  The outside one.
[37:34.460 --> 37:37.460]  They actually sell a 16-inch tomato cage that comes apart.
[37:37.460 --> 37:43.460]  The sticks are three different pieces, and the cage is two different loops that come apart, so you can put that on after.
[37:43.460 --> 37:45.460]  They really endorse those tomato cages.
[37:45.460 --> 37:46.460]  Those are fucking useful.
[37:46.460 --> 37:48.460]  Yeah, they're a good product. I like them.
[37:49.300 --> 37:51.300]  I actually might have learned about them through Subcool.
[37:51.300 --> 37:58.300]  Hey, mine were 99 cents, so I can't really complain when it's user error trying to get it onto something.
[37:58.300 --> 37:59.300]  Alright.
[37:59.300 --> 38:00.300]  That was Adam's words of wisdom.
[38:00.300 --> 38:01.300]  Yep.
[38:01.300 --> 38:02.300]  So, problems.
[38:02.300 --> 38:04.300]  You guys were talking about moths and worms.
[38:04.300 --> 38:05.300]  What the fuck?
[38:05.300 --> 38:16.300]  They are referred to in America as corn borers, and here's a little side conversation.
[38:17.140 --> 38:19.140]  They're actually, in Europe, called a hemp borer.
[38:19.140 --> 38:26.140]  When Prohibition hit, there wasn't any more hemp plants around, so they went for corn.
[38:26.140 --> 38:28.140]  And, uh...
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.140]  Um...
[38:29.140 --> 38:30.140]  Shit, you know.
[38:30.140 --> 38:32.140]  We're looking up a little bit on them here.
[38:32.140 --> 38:35.140]  Yeah, I'm Googling it right now. Sorry, that's why I got quiet.
[38:35.140 --> 38:40.140]  I know what a hillbilly knows. I don't know what he's about to read for us, hopefully.
[38:40.140 --> 38:42.140]  The European corn borer.
[38:42.140 --> 38:43.140]  Alright.
[38:43.140 --> 38:44.140]  There you go.
[38:44.980 --> 38:46.980]  I'm just reading it straight from Wikipedia.
[38:46.980 --> 38:53.980]  The European corn worm or European corn borer, also known as the European high flyer, is a pest of grain, particularly maize.
[38:53.980 --> 38:58.980]  The insect is native to Europe, originally infesting varieties of millet, including broom corn.
[38:58.980 --> 39:01.980]  It's an ugly fucking bug, dude.
[39:01.980 --> 39:02.980]  So...
[39:02.980 --> 39:03.980]  And it's huge.
[39:03.980 --> 39:09.980]  Yeah, well it says the European corn borer caterpillars damage the ears of corn as well as stalks by chewing tunnels,
[39:10.820 --> 39:13.820]  which cause the plant to fall over.
[39:13.820 --> 39:15.820]  Biological control agents of corn borers include...
[39:15.820 --> 39:17.820]  Sorry, I'm just going to read that part.
[39:17.820 --> 39:19.820]  But they dig a tunnel in there.
[39:19.820 --> 39:21.820]  I can't say it and read it all.
[39:21.820 --> 39:23.820]  And then they lay little eggs in there.
[39:23.820 --> 39:27.820]  And then it shows these fucking disgusting orange worms that grow out of there.
[39:27.820 --> 39:30.820]  This is when I got all freaked out.
[39:30.820 --> 39:32.820]  Like, what is this dark spot on my plant?
[39:32.820 --> 39:37.820]  You know, this is the kind of stuff that I knew that stuff will burrow and lay eggs inside of
[39:38.660 --> 39:40.660]  and then rot from the inside out.
[39:40.660 --> 39:42.660]  I've never seen them in the stalk.
[39:42.660 --> 39:44.660]  Okay, mine were like right at the base.
[39:44.660 --> 39:48.660]  They lay clusters of eggs on the leaves, usually the undersides.
[39:48.660 --> 39:53.660]  The egg masses or clusters are laid in an overlapping configuration.
[39:53.660 --> 39:57.660]  The water would develop inside the eggs and the eggs become more...
[39:57.660 --> 39:59.660]  Yeah, so these things are ugly.
[39:59.660 --> 40:03.660]  They eventually turn into a flying insect, I believe, correct?
[40:03.660 --> 40:07.660]  Yeah, well they fly, they land on the plant, they burrow in or they lay eggs on the bottom.
[40:08.500 --> 40:10.500]  And then they turn into these worms that chill in your plants also.
[40:10.500 --> 40:14.500]  So the original flying thing eats your plant, the new worm they left eats your plant,
[40:14.500 --> 40:16.500]  and then it turns into a flying thing that eats your plant
[40:16.500 --> 40:19.500]  and comes back and drops more of these fucking demon bugs on your plant.
[40:19.500 --> 40:21.500]  Yeah, terrible idea.
[40:21.500 --> 40:23.500]  Nazi, yeah.
[40:23.500 --> 40:25.500]  Good ways to get rid of them.
[40:27.500 --> 40:32.500]  Prevention is the best way I've came up with.
[40:33.340 --> 40:38.340]  I've spent hours picking them out by hand.
[40:38.340 --> 40:40.340]  Wow.
[40:40.340 --> 40:42.340]  Because they destroy...
[40:42.340 --> 40:44.340]  Fortunately, it's not going to destroy an entire crop.
[40:44.340 --> 40:46.340]  They destroy a piece of a bud.
[40:46.340 --> 40:48.340]  Okay.
[40:48.340 --> 40:52.340]  And when you're trimming at the end of the year, it is very easy to locate.
[40:52.340 --> 40:54.340]  I've spotted those orange worms in there.
[40:54.340 --> 40:57.340]  I actually knew a guy that would dry and smoke those orange worms himself.
[40:57.340 --> 40:59.340]  He grew that crop and he's like, those are mine.
[40:59.340 --> 41:01.340]  And he loved it.
[41:02.180 --> 41:04.180]  And you talk shit about me.
[41:08.180 --> 41:12.180]  Monterey spray has some effect on them.
[41:12.180 --> 41:14.180]  That's a great product. It contains spinosad.
[41:14.180 --> 41:16.180]  Spinosad. That's what I was looking for.
[41:16.180 --> 41:22.180]  Our good old friend neem oil, but it really sucks because you're spraying neem oil on a flower.
[41:22.180 --> 41:25.180]  I was going to ask, is that product okay with flowers?
[41:25.180 --> 41:27.180]  But I mean, not neem oil.
[41:27.180 --> 41:29.180]  I know what neem oil does.
[41:29.180 --> 41:31.180]  Yeah, don't put neem oil on your flowers.
[41:32.020 --> 41:34.020]  Monterey.
[41:34.020 --> 41:36.020]  What can you do?
[41:36.020 --> 41:38.020]  It's an organic.
[41:38.020 --> 41:42.020]  Use it as more of a deterrent, maybe?
[41:42.020 --> 41:46.020]  Yeah, I sprayed my plants with it all through veg.
[41:46.020 --> 41:48.020]  Religiously.
[41:48.020 --> 41:54.020]  Every four days they got sprayed with something different, mixed it up, kept it all organic.
[41:56.020 --> 41:58.020]  Something to scare those plants away.
[41:58.020 --> 42:00.020]  Or those bugs away, sorry.
[42:00.860 --> 42:02.860]  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[42:02.860 --> 42:04.860]  That's the goddamn truth.
[42:04.860 --> 42:06.860]  There you go. For sure.
[42:06.860 --> 42:08.860]  Alright.
[42:08.860 --> 42:10.860]  So we've gotten, man, fuck the moths.
[42:10.860 --> 42:12.860]  That's gross.
[42:12.860 --> 42:14.860]  They're big too, dude.
[42:14.860 --> 42:16.860]  They're like the size of a Bicklider, except triangular.
[42:16.860 --> 42:18.860]  So your Praying Mantis isn't going to do shit against those?
[42:18.860 --> 42:20.860]  No, actually, no.
[42:20.860 --> 42:22.860]  It's great to watch.
[42:22.860 --> 42:24.860]  I've seen one rip it out of the bud and fuck it.
[42:24.860 --> 42:26.860]  Nice.
[42:26.860 --> 42:28.860]  I'm sure that probably fills up a Praying Mantis pretty good.
[42:29.700 --> 42:31.700]  Oh yeah. Well, they're just fluff anyway.
[42:31.700 --> 42:33.700]  Then they get all that moth dust in your mouth.
[42:33.700 --> 42:35.700]  Yeah.
[42:35.700 --> 42:37.700]  Yuck.
[42:37.700 --> 42:39.700]  Gross.
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.700]  So yeah, those things are huge too.
[42:41.700 --> 42:43.700]  I've seen them.
[42:43.700 --> 42:45.700]  It's a cool story that you fucking said that they used to be hemp moths.
[42:45.700 --> 42:47.700]  Yeah, hemp hemp workers.
[42:47.700 --> 42:49.700]  Before they were corn, because the wiki didn't say anything about that.
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.700]  Yeah, well look up hemp workers.
[42:51.700 --> 42:53.700]  It probably links me to those.
[42:53.700 --> 42:55.700]  Yeah.
[42:55.700 --> 42:57.700]  We'll do it just for fun.
[42:58.540 --> 43:00.540]  Yeah, it's the corn moth.
[43:00.540 --> 43:02.540]  Link you right there.
[43:02.540 --> 43:04.540]  Did you mean this? You're in America.
[43:04.540 --> 43:06.540]  Yeah, actually, an old timer told me that.
[43:06.540 --> 43:08.540]  There's not a wiki for it, but it's all weed stuff though.
[43:08.540 --> 43:10.540]  It's all like nasty bugs, nasty bugs, and it's the same picture.
[43:10.540 --> 43:12.540]  Yeah.
[43:12.540 --> 43:14.540]  Yep.
[43:14.540 --> 43:16.540]  Gross.
[43:16.540 --> 43:18.540]  Wow, that was a freaky sound.
[43:18.540 --> 43:20.540]  Whoever's phone did that one.
[43:20.540 --> 43:22.540]  No, is that not anybody's phone?
[43:22.540 --> 43:24.540]  No, that was my phone.
[43:24.540 --> 43:26.540]  I don't understand why that's going on.
[43:27.380 --> 43:29.380]  It was dead forever ago, and now I feel like an idiot because it was my phone.
[43:29.380 --> 43:31.380]  It's all good.
[43:31.380 --> 43:33.380]  It's all the way down.
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.380]  I'm not going to call you out about leaving your phone on on table during a podcast.
[43:35.380 --> 43:37.380]  I won't do that.
[43:37.380 --> 43:39.380]  Completely unprofessional about it.
[43:39.380 --> 43:41.380]  Now, we have talked about moths and worms.
[43:41.380 --> 43:43.380]  Other than the obvious problem that I'm going to bring up, what are any other problems we can look for right now that we can work with right now that we can try to prevent?
[43:43.380 --> 43:45.380]  I don't know.
[43:45.380 --> 43:47.380]  I don't know.
[43:47.380 --> 43:49.380]  I don't know.
[43:49.380 --> 43:51.380]  I don't know.
[43:51.380 --> 43:53.380]  I don't know.
[43:53.380 --> 43:55.380]  I don't know.
[43:55.380 --> 43:57.380]  But what can we do to try and prevent?
[43:57.380 --> 43:59.380]  It's still pretty early in flowering.
[43:59.380 --> 44:02.380]  Spider mites are going to come up.
[44:02.380 --> 44:04.380]  Don't say that word.
[44:08.380 --> 44:10.380]  I didn't want to hear that.
[44:10.380 --> 44:12.380]  If you don't have a lot of air circulation and it gets moist, it creates the conditions for powdery mold.
[44:15.400 --> 44:17.400]  Plan for the worst.
[44:17.660 --> 44:20.220]  Damn, I can't remember any brand names tonight.
[44:20.220 --> 44:25.220]  What about spiders?
[44:25.220 --> 44:28.020]  Actinovate, that's stuff for ox.
[44:28.640 --> 44:29.060]  That's
[44:29.420 --> 44:30.300]  Is that for powdery mildew?
[44:30.340 --> 44:30.740]  Yeah.
[44:30.820 --> 44:31.180]  Okay.
[44:31.220 --> 44:31.940]  Actinovate.
[44:32.060 --> 44:32.460]  Yeah.
[44:32.580 --> 44:33.660]  Jesse shouts that out.
[44:33.940 --> 44:37.020]  I'm testing a product called witches brew.
[44:37.340 --> 44:44.060]  Well, um, as soon as I find a situation to use it in, not to be a dick, but, um,
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.100]  but yeah, it's called witches brew and supposedly it just like totally
[44:48.100 --> 44:54.340]  annihilates powdery mildew, but, um, and it's totally organic and made in,
[44:54.500 --> 45:00.020]  uh, up in Denver somewhere, uh, or maybe Boulder, you know, up north somewhere.
[45:00.300 --> 45:04.180]  Um, so, uh, uh, and it's cheap too.
[45:04.500 --> 45:06.700]  And a lot of you guys are, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.
[45:07.460 --> 45:08.540]  You look like you might need a hand.
[45:09.660 --> 45:12.940]  A lot of you guys are not in places where you're able to walk into a hydro
[45:12.940 --> 45:16.180]  shop and be like, yo, I need frigging the whole big bottle of Spinosad.
[45:16.220 --> 45:16.500]  Sorry.
[45:16.820 --> 45:18.140]  Hit the volume button on the wrong way there.
[45:18.460 --> 45:19.020]  Fucking with something.
[45:19.700 --> 45:21.620]  Uh, you can't be like, I need a big bottle of Monterey spray.
[45:21.620 --> 45:23.540]  So I was actually at go ahead, bro.
[45:23.940 --> 45:24.420]  No, no.
[45:24.420 --> 45:25.180]  I'm just looking.
[45:25.380 --> 45:25.740]  Oh, okay.
[45:26.020 --> 45:27.660]  I thought you were going to say something real quick.
[45:27.700 --> 45:30.180]  You can get a, a moderator at a home Depot.
[45:30.300 --> 45:31.580]  That's where exactly Rose headed.
[45:31.580 --> 45:37.420]  You guys in Tennessee, Georgia, Florida that might, I don't condone your growing.
[45:37.420 --> 45:38.300]  I can't support that.
[45:38.340 --> 45:40.140]  Don't fucking do that illegal against the law.
[45:40.180 --> 45:40.740]  That's up to you.
[45:40.740 --> 45:41.380]  You're a grown man.
[45:41.500 --> 45:43.420]  But if you happen to be doing that, cause I can't condone it.
[45:43.420 --> 45:45.180]  I can't support it for the right to do that.
[45:45.380 --> 45:45.620]  Yeah.
[45:45.660 --> 45:45.860]  Yeah.
[45:45.860 --> 45:48.900]  But, but I'll go to jail if I say, Hey, you in Kentucky grow fucking weed.
[45:49.220 --> 45:54.580]  But if you insist on doing it, you can get your products at like Lowe's and home Depot.
[45:54.580 --> 45:58.020]  If you're really careful about what you do, look for that Omri certified shit.
[45:58.500 --> 46:01.220]  Uh, there are a few products that Monterey spray that we were talking about.
[46:01.220 --> 46:02.700]  It just says Monterey insect spray.
[46:02.700 --> 46:05.260]  It's been, it says contain spinosad right on the bottle.
[46:05.700 --> 46:09.420]  Uh, spinosad kills a lot of, uh, insects that you'll find in the garden.
[46:09.460 --> 46:09.660]  Yeah.
[46:09.660 --> 46:10.500]  It's organic.
[46:10.500 --> 46:11.100]  It's safe.
[46:11.140 --> 46:12.660]  Neem oil is also out there.
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.060]  Neem oil is there for veg.
[46:14.100 --> 46:16.020]  Uh, you should use Neem oil and veg often.
[46:16.020 --> 46:16.820]  It's your friend.
[46:17.180 --> 46:17.740]  Uh, it's cheap.
[46:17.740 --> 46:18.340]  It's affordable.
[46:18.340 --> 46:21.820]  You can dilute it and you're really not going to hurt anything unless you use it
[46:21.820 --> 46:23.860]  in flour, even spray the ground around it.
[46:24.020 --> 46:24.380]  Yeah.
[46:24.580 --> 46:24.780]  Yeah.
[46:25.340 --> 46:26.340]  I saw a product.
[46:26.420 --> 46:29.500]  I can't remember the name, but it contains white oil.
[46:29.500 --> 46:30.660]  It's a little tiny bottle.
[46:30.700 --> 46:31.740]  It's nine bucks.
[46:32.300 --> 46:33.780]  Uh, it's got some white oil in it.
[46:33.780 --> 46:37.540]  I have not used it yet, but I'm sure that that would knock out your flying
[46:37.540 --> 46:40.660]  insects and mites really quickly.
[46:40.940 --> 46:43.180]  I'll have to research the name, but look for it guys.
[46:43.180 --> 46:47.540]  If you need some stuff, you can actually get your products at a home Depot or
[46:47.540 --> 46:48.860]  Lowe's or something similar.
[46:49.060 --> 46:49.900]  Just be careful.
[46:49.940 --> 46:51.620]  Uh, don't be discreet.
[46:51.660 --> 46:55.780]  Don't talk about your weed when you're at any store, even the hydro shop.
[46:55.780 --> 46:58.620]  The only place you can talk about your grow is in your grow or
[46:58.620 --> 46:59.780]  at your table with your crew.
[47:00.420 --> 47:02.940]  Uh, we're talking about problems and a garden right now.
[47:02.980 --> 47:04.660]  We're going to, we're talking about bugs and shit.
[47:04.660 --> 47:07.300]  One more thing is fucking homies and shit.
[47:07.300 --> 47:08.380]  Be careful who you tell.
[47:08.380 --> 47:12.260]  Everybody's your friend today, but in like a week when you guys have the
[47:12.260 --> 47:16.460]  stupidest fight over the dumbest song on the radio that reminded you with that
[47:16.500 --> 47:17.860]  girl, Oh, you were with her too.
[47:17.860 --> 47:18.460]  Fuck you.
[47:18.460 --> 47:19.740]  Now you're not friends anymore.
[47:20.020 --> 47:23.620]  He's got to grow officer or we're going to steal his grow or
[47:24.060 --> 47:25.340]  just shut up about your girl.
[47:25.340 --> 47:27.140]  Everybody knows everybody in Colorado grows.
[47:27.420 --> 47:30.300]  There's so much of it here that it's not as threatening.
[47:30.300 --> 47:31.180]  It's not as crazy.
[47:31.180 --> 47:33.620]  Everyone's growing their own crops here, but you guys that are in those other
[47:33.620 --> 47:36.740]  places, just be careful with your grow.
[47:36.780 --> 47:38.460]  You guys have been, go ahead, man.
[47:38.700 --> 47:44.420]  I might've grown a plant or two before medical and, uh, uh, there was no such
[47:44.420 --> 47:46.620]  thing as talking to anyone about it.
[47:46.700 --> 47:47.060]  Yeah.
[47:47.140 --> 47:47.980]  Anyone at all.
[47:48.700 --> 47:49.780]  I remember that vibe.
[47:49.820 --> 47:52.700]  When you go to the hydro shop before everybody had a medical card, it was
[47:52.700 --> 47:53.860]  dead silence.
[47:54.260 --> 47:58.460]  You could hear the cashier going and she run up your shit in the hydro store and
[47:58.460 --> 48:02.220]  she'd mumbled numbers because she didn't want Jesse to hear how much I just
[48:02.220 --> 48:03.740]  fucking spent at the hydro shop.
[48:03.740 --> 48:08.100]  So even write it on paper or the classic.
[48:08.260 --> 48:09.300]  No, never.
[48:09.420 --> 48:13.140]  I'm not even going to say when you run into friends at the hydro shop, if you
[48:13.140 --> 48:15.860]  and I used to run into each other, Hey bro, can I get a cut of that white widow?
[48:15.860 --> 48:16.140]  Sure.
[48:16.140 --> 48:17.180]  I'll trade you for that grip.
[48:17.220 --> 48:21.420]  Oh, we shop on, or I'll tell you to shut up in there.
[48:21.460 --> 48:24.140]  That never happened to me, at least back then.
[48:24.260 --> 48:28.580]  And I'm just, yeah, that's all right.
[48:28.620 --> 48:29.820]  Jesse's got a horror story.
[48:29.820 --> 48:33.780]  He's going to share with me after the podcast, coming from out East, anything
[48:33.780 --> 48:37.500]  that I ever had outside and was like, yo, check this out.
[48:38.220 --> 48:38.740]  It was gone.
[48:38.940 --> 48:39.180]  Yeah.
[48:39.620 --> 48:41.700]  I'm going to tell you right now for no what?
[48:41.700 --> 48:42.060]  Yeah.
[48:42.060 --> 48:43.020]  It's always your friends.
[48:43.060 --> 48:45.940]  I mean, that's, I'm here to tell you right now, nine times out of 10, if
[48:45.940 --> 48:47.980]  something's stolen from me, it's somebody, you know, you know what I'm
[48:47.980 --> 48:48.220]  saying?
[48:48.220 --> 48:49.700]  It's somebody you bragged about.
[48:50.140 --> 48:53.780]  So you just, you know, keep it quiet.
[48:54.620 --> 48:54.860]  Yeah.
[48:54.940 --> 48:56.140]  Don't bring girls to your spot.
[48:56.140 --> 49:00.780]  If you're growing, no one, they don't, they don't know what to look at anyways.
[49:00.780 --> 49:06.060]  So yeah, but, and well then they just talk randomly and if they don't have any
[49:06.100 --> 49:08.020]  business being there, don't bring girls.
[49:08.020 --> 49:11.180]  If you're just trying to be cool, don't bring girls to your grow to be cool.
[49:11.220 --> 49:12.060]  That's failure.
[49:12.180 --> 49:15.860]  I've seen women bring down girl rooms until the pot's harvested.
[49:16.180 --> 49:17.340]  Like I love you ladies.
[49:17.420 --> 49:21.340]  I love the loyal ladies that are loyal to their man, but some of you girls don't
[49:21.340 --> 49:23.580]  know when to stop talking about the grow room that you saw.
[49:23.580 --> 49:24.700]  And that's not your fault.
[49:24.740 --> 49:25.460]  I may or may not.
[49:25.460 --> 49:28.500]  That's that guy's fault for taking you to the grow room without knowing you well
[49:28.500 --> 49:28.860]  enough.
[49:28.980 --> 49:33.540]  I may or may not have had a plant snapped in half a couple of times.
[49:34.940 --> 49:35.420]  All right.
[49:35.420 --> 49:41.740]  So this leads us to something that we all dread other than the police and Colorado.
[49:41.740 --> 49:43.500]  We don't worry a lot about the police anymore.
[49:43.500 --> 49:44.380]  We all obey the law.
[49:44.380 --> 49:48.580]  We either have a medical marijuana card or we are an adult in Colorado.
[49:48.620 --> 49:51.020]  Any adult over 21 can grow six plants.
[49:51.140 --> 49:53.140]  I think you're allowed to grow six plants at any house.
[49:53.140 --> 49:55.500]  I don't know that if Jesse and I lived in the same house, I don't know if we
[49:55.500 --> 49:56.500]  could grow 12 outside.
[49:56.500 --> 50:00.940]  I don't know how that works, but as a medical marijuana provider, a lot of us
[50:00.940 --> 50:01.820]  have increased counts.
[50:01.820 --> 50:03.540]  You look like you might have something to add to that.
[50:04.020 --> 50:04.740]  I've heard it does.
[50:05.540 --> 50:05.900]  Okay.
[50:06.180 --> 50:10.300]  So, but you know, I don't want to be accused of giving anyone legal advice.
[50:10.300 --> 50:10.580]  Yeah.
[50:12.380 --> 50:13.380]  I'm in that spectrum.
[50:13.500 --> 50:14.060]  You know what I'm saying?
[50:14.060 --> 50:17.820]  Of where I'm allowed to have six plants, but I'm allowed to have three flowering
[50:17.820 --> 50:20.060]  and three on not flowering.
[50:20.100 --> 50:20.340]  Right.
[50:20.340 --> 50:21.460]  That's the law in Colorado.
[50:21.460 --> 50:24.700]  You can have six plants, three in flower, three, not in flower.
[50:25.140 --> 50:29.580]  Um, I don't know the freaking logistics or whatever the bottom end of the fine print.
[50:29.620 --> 50:33.620]  I don't know if, if Adam and I and Jesse live together, can we do 18 plants in the
[50:33.620 --> 50:34.020]  backyard?
[50:34.020 --> 50:34.660]  I'm not sure.
[50:34.980 --> 50:37.980]  They seem to kind of be up on that and they kind of seem to cock block a lot of
[50:37.980 --> 50:38.380]  those moves.
[50:38.380 --> 50:39.420]  They're smart in Colorado.
[50:39.420 --> 50:40.100]  They're catching on.
[50:40.580 --> 50:42.020]  Anyway, we digress.
[50:42.060 --> 50:42.660]  Jesse's walking.
[50:42.660 --> 50:45.740]  So he's tiptoeing and his Jordan's through the kitchen, trying to get a bottle of
[50:45.740 --> 50:46.060]  water.
[50:49.420 --> 50:56.140]  I actually heard a rumor that Pueblo County is going to in state a 18 plant limit per
[50:56.140 --> 50:57.140]  household total.
[51:00.860 --> 51:02.100]  So that could happen.
[51:02.180 --> 51:03.660]  That sounds like shit that Pueblo does.
[51:04.340 --> 51:05.540]  But, uh, yeah.
[51:05.540 --> 51:06.740]  So we're allowed to have six plants.
[51:06.740 --> 51:08.980]  God, you just fucking changed my whole thought process.
[51:08.980 --> 51:09.460]  I don't like it.
[51:09.460 --> 51:10.420]  We're going to have to go political.
[51:10.660 --> 51:15.500]  Um, well, I, uh, I got a, uh, set in with, with the town hall meeting the other day,
[51:15.580 --> 51:17.180]  um, with Sal Pace.
[51:17.780 --> 51:24.740]  Um, it was pretty much, uh, he was campaigning, um, for himself, but, uh, uh,
[51:24.780 --> 51:29.340]  he, he did, someone brought up marijuana and he was real quick to, uh, bring up the
[51:29.340 --> 51:32.220]  fact that, uh, they're, they're planning on instating that.
[51:32.540 --> 51:34.980]  And so I've already called him twice.
[51:35.140 --> 51:38.300]  Um, and I left a message at the end of the town hall meeting.
[51:38.340 --> 51:41.660]  So, yeah, a lot of you guys that grow those little tiny hydro plants are like
[51:41.660 --> 51:42.460]  six inches tall.
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.820]  You wouldn't be able to get shit off of 18 plants.
[51:45.380 --> 51:45.660]  Yeah.
[51:45.740 --> 51:46.740]  I want clarification.
[51:46.740 --> 51:50.100]  It was, he just talking recreational and stuff like that.
[51:50.100 --> 51:51.020]  And we're caregivers.
[51:51.060 --> 51:53.700]  Like I've got patients that rely on that's okay.
[51:53.700 --> 51:53.940]  Yeah.
[51:53.940 --> 51:56.220]  We got to, we'll bring that up on further episodes.
[51:56.220 --> 51:58.140]  You guys will get into this and figure out what's going on so far.
[51:58.140 --> 51:59.340]  It's just a, the start.
[52:00.060 --> 52:03.620]  Uh, we've talked about bringing the wrong people to your grow.
[52:03.620 --> 52:05.620]  We've talked about trying to impress chicks.
[52:05.860 --> 52:07.580]  Here's the biggest fucking problem.
[52:07.940 --> 52:08.380]  Thieves.
[52:08.380 --> 52:11.060]  You guys, people are going to steal your outdoor weed.
[52:11.540 --> 52:12.420]  It's going to happen.
[52:12.980 --> 52:15.700]  Uh, if you grow for three years in a row, one of those years, you're
[52:15.700 --> 52:16.740]  not going to get a harvest.
[52:16.740 --> 52:18.060]  It's going to be fucking stolen.
[52:18.420 --> 52:19.060]  Take a break.
[52:19.540 --> 52:22.380]  That's the, that's the old school rule.
[52:23.980 --> 52:25.860]  Do two times, take a break, find a spot.
[52:26.460 --> 52:26.820]  Yeah.
[52:26.900 --> 52:28.260]  Okay, man.
[52:28.380 --> 52:29.380]  That's all it makes sense.
[52:29.380 --> 52:31.140]  Come back two years later, a year later.
[52:31.460 --> 52:31.820]  Okay.
[52:31.860 --> 52:32.020]  Yeah.
[52:32.020 --> 52:33.860]  Cause next year they're going to know that crop is there.
[52:33.900 --> 52:35.980]  They'll go and look and they'll be like, oh, it's not here to give up.
[52:36.460 --> 52:36.860]  All right.
[52:37.140 --> 52:39.180]  So thieves are going to come to your garden.
[52:40.060 --> 52:42.900]  Uh, I don't even want to talk too much about this story.
[52:42.900 --> 52:45.460]  It's just something that needs to be mentioned recently in our community.
[52:45.460 --> 52:48.820]  A 13 year old boy was shot in the back because he was attempting to steal
[52:48.820 --> 52:50.420]  somebody's outdoor marijuana grow.
[52:51.220 --> 52:52.260]  That dude was arrested.
[52:52.340 --> 52:53.300]  He's in fucking jail.
[52:53.300 --> 52:54.180]  He's going to go to court.
[52:54.580 --> 52:55.900]  Uh, he shot that person in the back.
[52:55.900 --> 52:56.580]  I wasn't there.
[52:56.980 --> 52:58.540]  I'd like to point out this was a pellet.
[52:58.580 --> 52:58.940]  Oh yes.
[52:58.940 --> 53:00.700]  It was a high caliber pellet gun.
[53:00.700 --> 53:03.500]  Pellet is now was not an actual firearm.
[53:03.620 --> 53:04.020]  Right.
[53:04.340 --> 53:08.260]  Uh, but the pellet is lodged in this kid's organs and he had to be taken to,
[53:08.420 --> 53:10.700]  uh, Denver children's hospital to be rescued.
[53:10.700 --> 53:11.260]  He almost died.
[53:11.260 --> 53:12.260]  He's in critical condition.
[53:13.100 --> 53:15.740]  Uh, I'm not on either one of these guys sides.
[53:15.780 --> 53:16.980]  I'm not on the shooter's side.
[53:16.980 --> 53:18.020]  I'm not on the kid's side.
[53:18.020 --> 53:18.740]  The kid was a thief.
[53:18.740 --> 53:19.300]  He was in the yard.
[53:19.300 --> 53:23.220]  He was actually, the newspaper said he was out of the yard and he shot him in the
[53:23.220 --> 53:23.620]  back.
[53:23.620 --> 53:26.540]  But, uh, we're just going to act like that.
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.580]  He was right next to the pot plants in this story.
[53:28.980 --> 53:29.940]  Think about this.
[53:30.140 --> 53:31.420]  It's fucking three in the morning.
[53:31.980 --> 53:33.420]  He was part of a gang as well.
[53:33.540 --> 53:33.900]  Okay.
[53:33.900 --> 53:34.620]  I'd like to point out.
[53:34.780 --> 53:35.020]  Yeah.
[53:35.020 --> 53:36.220]  If there's multiple, then you got it.
[53:36.340 --> 53:37.980]  So he's the one that got it then.
[53:38.100 --> 53:38.300]  Yeah.
[53:38.300 --> 53:39.060]  He's the one.
[53:39.380 --> 53:40.780]  The slow let's put this story.
[53:40.820 --> 53:43.820]  Let's let's put everybody that's listening to this, that has an outdoor crop.
[53:43.820 --> 53:45.620]  I want to put this story in their heads right now.
[53:45.860 --> 53:46.300]  It's three.
[53:46.300 --> 53:47.740]  You've got your pot plants outside.
[53:48.140 --> 53:50.060]  It's like seven days before you cut them down.
[53:50.140 --> 53:51.060]  You've got a hard on.
[53:51.420 --> 53:52.460]  You're just fucking drooling.
[53:52.460 --> 53:53.500]  You're rubbing your hands together.
[53:53.500 --> 53:55.740]  Like it's like a porno is about to start.
[53:55.740 --> 53:56.460]  You're fucking drooling.
[53:56.460 --> 53:57.540]  Like food is cooking.
[53:57.860 --> 53:59.180]  You're about to go on the ride of your life.
[53:59.180 --> 54:00.940]  You got your outdoor crop about to come down.
[54:01.300 --> 54:02.260]  It's three in the morning.
[54:02.380 --> 54:04.660]  You get woken up to the dogs going nuts.
[54:04.700 --> 54:07.660]  You get woken up to the fucking lights coming on.
[54:07.660 --> 54:10.020]  You look on your security cameras that hopefully you have.
[54:10.300 --> 54:13.020]  We're going to talk a couple in a couple of seconds about things to do to prevent
[54:13.020 --> 54:14.620]  some thieves, but I want to set this story here.
[54:15.020 --> 54:15.740]  What are you going to do?
[54:16.100 --> 54:17.180]  Those alarms are going off.
[54:17.180 --> 54:18.860]  The assholes up on your security camera.
[54:18.860 --> 54:20.460]  You can see them cutting down your plant.
[54:20.460 --> 54:23.180]  He's about to, it's a fucking 19 year old kid.
[54:23.540 --> 54:24.460]  He's wearing a black hoodie.
[54:24.460 --> 54:27.460]  You can't tell who he is cutting your shit down, dude.
[54:27.460 --> 54:30.100]  He's about to run out of your yard here in Colorado.
[54:30.740 --> 54:31.940]  Like a 90% chance.
[54:31.940 --> 54:33.140]  There's a gun in your house.
[54:34.180 --> 54:35.820]  Probably you've got a baseball bat.
[54:36.220 --> 54:37.780]  If you're a camper, you got a machete.
[54:38.620 --> 54:41.300]  Think about what you're going to do because it could happen to you.
[54:41.780 --> 54:44.860]  And you could walk out there and put yourself in a more dangerous
[54:44.860 --> 54:46.540]  situation than what you're ready for.
[54:47.020 --> 54:50.220]  Uh, you could walk out there and be like this guy in our town that shot
[54:50.220 --> 54:53.060]  somebody and has to deal with a kid that could die right now.
[54:53.460 --> 54:56.980]  And I don't think that that kid's life was worth anything in my house.
[54:57.020 --> 54:58.580]  If you want something, I'll let you have it.
[54:58.660 --> 54:59.420]  And I won't kill you.
[54:59.420 --> 55:02.540]  And that sounds like something fucking stupid to say, but if you need it that
[55:02.540 --> 55:05.580]  bad, it's not worth killing you for I'll make more money, I'll grow more.
[55:05.580 --> 55:07.940]  Next year, leave my mother plants and my seeds where they are.
[55:07.940 --> 55:08.740]  It will be just fine.
[55:10.700 --> 55:11.740]  Well, you have it like that.
[55:11.740 --> 55:16.860]  Whereas somebody like me who is depending, you know, on those three plants, not
[55:16.860 --> 55:19.580]  only for me, but for my old lady, you know, and it's.
[55:20.740 --> 55:22.140]  It would be rough for that.
[55:22.180 --> 55:24.620]  You know, I would be spending money every week.
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.940]  Well, that's why I'm trying to put that story in these growers heads.
[55:26.940 --> 55:29.260]  Now, these new folks heads that haven't had to deal with this.
[55:29.420 --> 55:33.260]  Let me break it down from the, from the suspects perspective.
[55:33.340 --> 55:36.620]  He's, you know, he got woken up at two 30 in the morning.
[55:36.780 --> 55:44.180]  He grabbed a, uh, air, a BB gun and he shot someone in his yard, protecting
[55:44.220 --> 55:48.060]  his plants in an effort to protect his plants while the cop showed
[55:48.060 --> 55:49.060]  up because he shot someone.
[55:50.500 --> 55:56.540]  And the cops saw his plants and he shot someone and the cops realized that he
[55:56.540 --> 55:59.100]  valued his plants more than he valued human life.
[55:59.780 --> 56:05.140]  So now he's sitting in a jail cell because these people otherwise didn't,
[56:05.780 --> 56:07.940]  you know, he was protecting his property.
[56:07.980 --> 56:08.480]  Yeah.
[56:08.900 --> 56:11.100]  Well, I'm, I'm highly conflicted on this.
[56:11.100 --> 56:11.600]  I don't know.
[56:11.660 --> 56:12.160]  Yeah.
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.380]  That's why I tried to not, I said, I'm not taking a side.
[56:14.380 --> 56:19.620]  I wasn't there, but I want, even if he gets away with it, his face has been on
[56:19.660 --> 56:20.160]  the paper.
[56:20.700 --> 56:22.180]  Um, his plants are still there.
[56:22.180 --> 56:23.860]  Everyone in town knows they're there.
[56:23.980 --> 56:28.020]  The cops won't touch them cause they're not going to maintain that evidence.
[56:28.500 --> 56:30.860]  So he's got to spend lawyer fees.
[56:31.140 --> 56:32.540]  He probably lost his job.
[56:32.540 --> 56:34.060]  His dad's been on the news.
[56:34.420 --> 56:38.900]  Um, and even if he gets away with it all, he still lost his plants.
[56:38.980 --> 56:39.620]  Was it worth it?
[56:41.140 --> 56:42.140]  No, not at all.
[56:42.260 --> 56:47.820]  And a little boy has, I mean, so, um, just don't do it.
[56:47.860 --> 56:48.360]  Yeah.
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.800]  I've been thinking that, Oh, I'll just get them with the pellet gun.
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.760]  Like, you know, you just coming out the door with the pellet gun.
[56:55.280 --> 56:56.920]  Oh, they were running.
[56:56.960 --> 56:58.640]  You can get yourself shot doing that.
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.140]  Yeah.
[57:00.560 --> 57:01.060]  Exactly.
[57:01.080 --> 57:01.580]  Yeah.
[57:01.600 --> 57:02.560]  You know, and that's the other thing.
[57:02.560 --> 57:03.080]  That's what I said.
[57:03.080 --> 57:05.960]  You can walk out and put yourself in worse danger than what you were prepared
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.520]  for to deal with for those plants.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.320]  And if you love your dogs, don't turn them out either.
[57:10.400 --> 57:10.900]  Yep.
[57:10.920 --> 57:11.420]  Yeah.
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.280]  I agree with that.
[57:12.320 --> 57:13.960]  Like it, it sucks, man.
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.080]  It's happened to me.
[57:15.080 --> 57:15.580]  It sucks.
[57:15.600 --> 57:16.600]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[57:16.600 --> 57:18.800]  Cause if you interrupt, they're going to run off.
[57:18.840 --> 57:19.340]  Yeah.
[57:19.360 --> 57:19.860]  Hopefully.
[57:19.880 --> 57:21.160]  Well, hopefully.
[57:21.160 --> 57:21.880]  Let them go nuts.
[57:21.880 --> 57:22.720]  Turn the lights on.
[57:22.760 --> 57:23.260]  Yeah.
[57:23.280 --> 57:23.780]  Yeah.
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.440]  If you can get a good look at the situation, try to scare them off.
[57:27.480 --> 57:30.560]  You know, maybe you got an elevated, you know, maybe you can walk out on a
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.000]  back balcony or something like that.
[57:32.320 --> 57:35.960]  You know, just scaring them off, you know, throwing a rock at them.
[57:35.960 --> 57:39.120]  I don't see, you know, get the fuck out of my yard.
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.000]  If someone's in your yard, throw a fucking rock at them.
[57:41.000 --> 57:41.500]  Hell yeah.
[57:41.520 --> 57:42.020]  I like that.
[57:42.800 --> 57:46.240]  I mean, if you know your dog's got the situation, you know,
[57:46.600 --> 57:49.680]  still literally hit somebody in the head with a damn hand size rock and
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.360]  probably do some real good size damage.
[57:51.360 --> 57:51.880]  That's true.
[57:52.160 --> 57:52.660]  That's true.
[57:53.680 --> 57:53.920]  Yeah.
[57:53.920 --> 57:57.040]  So that's my point is think about, be prepared what you're going to do,
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.200]  because I don't want you to have to, the only way to be prepared for that
[58:00.200 --> 58:01.600]  situation is to think about it today.
[58:01.600 --> 58:02.600]  While I'm telling you about it.
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.720]  So that when someone's in your yard, stealing your shit, you
[58:04.720 --> 58:06.120]  don't panic and shit your pants.
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.000]  Uh, hopefully if you prepare for it and think about it, you've got a plan of
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.200]  action, uh, you know how to get out there quickly, you know how to get rid of a
[58:13.200 --> 58:13.700]  thief.
[58:13.960 --> 58:16.360]  I don't want anybody to try to be a hero for a pot plant.
[58:16.360 --> 58:19.880]  I don't want to hear about anybody else shooting more people for weed plants.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.720]  We don't need that kind of publicity.
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.880]  It's not getting ready to go to jail for, you know, anything near a weed
[58:26.880 --> 58:27.160]  grower.
[58:27.160 --> 58:28.360]  Don't put that on the industry.
[58:28.680 --> 58:28.960]  Yeah.
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.360]  Just, um, yeah, this, we, we don't need that.
[58:33.400 --> 58:33.900]  So.
[58:35.800 --> 58:38.960]  In Colorado, we shouldn't be growing enough to make it worth robbing us,
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.440]  which that sounds weird.
[58:40.440 --> 58:40.940]  Yeah.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.320]  And don't, don't, we're not defending thieves.
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.560]  No, we're, we're no, that is.
[58:46.160 --> 58:46.720]  The high road.
[58:46.760 --> 58:47.120]  Yeah.
[58:47.160 --> 58:48.400]  They are the lowest.
[58:48.560 --> 58:54.480]  Um, you know, we work so hard for what we have and in one night and a couple of
[58:54.480 --> 58:58.560]  hours, they take it all away from you and, you know, they leave it scattered down
[58:58.560 --> 58:59.080]  your alley.
[58:59.080 --> 59:02.920]  So you have to clean it up at eight o'clock in the morning and your neighbors,
[59:02.920 --> 59:06.720]  you know, finally realized what those, you know, it's just, uh, it's not worth it.
[59:06.760 --> 59:07.260]  Yeah.
[59:07.280 --> 59:08.640]  I've had one plant taken from me.
[59:08.640 --> 59:10.080]  I've grown one plant outside.
[59:10.120 --> 59:11.320]  Guess how many I got taken from me?
[59:11.480 --> 59:12.440]  One fucking plant.
[59:12.880 --> 59:14.480]  I lived in a snazzy neighborhood.
[59:14.760 --> 59:16.920]  That plant was in a nice backyard tucked away.
[59:16.960 --> 59:18.920]  I think the gardeners are the ones that fucking took that.
[59:18.920 --> 59:19.420]  Yeah.
[59:20.560 --> 59:26.560]  I, I have, uh, never grown in my own yard before or anything like that.
[59:26.600 --> 59:28.880]  Um, and the year I tried it, it got taken.
[59:28.920 --> 59:30.360]  So three plants.
[59:30.680 --> 59:31.180]  So.
[59:31.320 --> 59:31.820]  Damn.
[59:31.920 --> 59:32.420]  Yeah.
[59:32.440 --> 59:34.560]  So I guess we've scared the shit out of everybody.
[59:34.720 --> 59:35.560]  Just be prepared guys.
[59:35.560 --> 59:37.240]  I'm not, I don't know what you're going to do.
[59:37.240 --> 59:38.320]  I don't want you to shoot people.
[59:38.320 --> 59:39.320]  I don't want you to fight people.
[59:39.320 --> 59:41.240]  I want you to protect your crop peacefully.
[59:41.440 --> 59:43.560]  Use your voice, scare the shit out of them.
[59:43.920 --> 59:47.120]  But if you look outside and it's your cousin, Earl beat his fucking ass.
[59:47.160 --> 59:48.040]  Yeah, for sure.
[59:48.080 --> 59:48.580]  Yeah.
[59:48.800 --> 59:49.300]  Yeah.
[59:49.320 --> 59:51.000]  Well, I was going to, I was going to make the example.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.600]  If you're stealing Adam's plants and he catches you, Adam's fucked.
[59:54.600 --> 59:57.960]  If he walks out and tries to stop you, if Adam's stealing your plants and you
[59:57.960 --> 59:59.160]  catch them, Adam is fucked.
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.320]  If you try to catch him, the array of outcomes could be very broad.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.440]  If there's a thief in your yard.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.200]  But then again, me knowing that I'm going to steal his plants, I'm not,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.760]  probably not coming with just my little skinny arms either.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.260]  Right.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.900]  And, but you're going to his house.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.700]  So, you know, he's got more than his big ass arms in there.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.820]  Well, and that's just the thing.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.620]  This all just keeps going to where it's.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.120]  Yeah.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:21.680]  Yep.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.180]  Very quickly.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:22.680]  Yep.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.460]  And it is not worth it.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.260]  It's just a plant.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.780]  You should put some outside.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.900]  You should put some outside next month or next year.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:30.480]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.620]  Try again next year.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.460]  Grow indoors.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]  So don't shoot thieves.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.340]  That's my advice.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:34.840]  Please.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.340]  Jail sucks.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340]  You don't want to go to jail.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:40.820]  We need to talk about if we don't want to lose our plants and shoot people, how
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.860]  can we prevent this?
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.900]  Uh, dogs, right?
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.580]  Big dogs in your backyard, keeping them through at night.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.700]  Don't, if you're going to use them as security, don't leave them.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.300]  Uh, you know, don't, you know, these, these are working dogs.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.740]  They, they need to stay outside.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.620]  Have a good dog house.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.180]  It's summer.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.180]  Yeah. It's the summer in Colorado.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.580]  They should be outside protecting your shit.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.120]  Yeah.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.300]  Uh, I like a mixture of big dogs and little dogs.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.740]  Yeah. Those little yapper dogs.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.820]  They wake up the big ones and then, and then it's on.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:12.680]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.260]  Fucking big pit bulls will come do business.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.060]  We've got one.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.380]  He doesn't sleep.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.500]  Uh, at, during the night, during the summer, he's just gotten, I don't, I don't
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.000]  know.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.300]  Yeah. He knows that those crops are important.
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.420]  So, uh, also if your dog bites somebody, you're going to have to fucking deal with
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:30.920]  that.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.440]  Yep.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.260]  Uh, they're going to take your dog.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.420]  They're going to put your dog into quarantine.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.420]  Make it doesn't have, make sure it doesn't have rabies.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.740]  Uh, if your dog really eats the shit out of somebody, hopefully it doesn't come to
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.420]  that. Hopefully.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.780]  Uh, I want to use two dogs as examples.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.860]  Uh, if I got into a yard and Soraka Nana rushed me and barked at me, I would be
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.480]  gone.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.820]  I'm not a very good runner, but I would run a record lap with those two dogs
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.460]  behind me.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.260]  So hopefully that's all you got to do.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.120]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.460]  Uh, lights and cameras are your best friend.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.340]  Lights and cameras are anybody's best friend.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.300]  If you live in a sketchy hood, put some lights and cameras up on your house.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.060]  Uh, floodlights and cameras.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.300]  And once people see those cameras, they know, and they're like, I don't even
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.260]  motion sensors.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.580]  Mount them high enough so that, um, an animal isn't going to set them off.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.400]  There you go.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.940]  Um, I live in the city.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.060]  There's a couple little tricks you can do with them, but if that animal, I've
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.700]  been up to set off a motion detector over here.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.540]  We got a fucking shooting.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.500]  I got deer right across the house.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.140]  You know, those deer may come have a snack on your plants one day.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.580]  You might want to keep an eye on that.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.380]  Putting the dog out there.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:34.880]  Believe me.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.060]  Do you know what's good?
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:36.740]  You know?
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.320]  Yeah.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.380]  I don't know if they want my weed.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.580]  Good that week.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.500]  I got one plant that smells like Skittles.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.260]  The other three or the other two are just like, yeah.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.540]  Nah, it's early still.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.420]  They shouldn't have much of a lot of aroma yet.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.860]  So have you guys ever hung bells on your plants?
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.260]  Just like the Christmas decorations?
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:54.980]  Is that effective?
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.020]  It would be, it would be.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.820]  These are cowards.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.580]  It doesn't take much to scare them off.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.200]  Okay.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.660]  Especially, I mean, put yourselves in their shoes.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.180]  They're in someone's backyard.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.460]  They do not know in the middle of the night it is, and they're doing something.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.300]  Uh, you know, they're breaking two or three rules and, and laws and all kinds of shit.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.460]  Uh, it's not going to take much to spook them.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.460]  And it's likely somebody, you know, so they don't want you to see their face or
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.460]  their clothes or their body language.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.380]  Don't tell anybody about those either.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.100]  Like, you know, tuck them up in there.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:23.720]  Yeah.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:29.220]  Another, um, when mine got taken, uh, they were heavily, heavily bambooed.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:35.140]  Um, I had, uh, you know, kind of made a big old fricking bush out of one little
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:35.640]  thing.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:42.060]  Um, the bamboos actually played, uh, it was hard for them to pull the plant out.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:42.640]  Oh, I bet.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:48.540]  I still had, you know, a couple of branches left to each one, but, um, you
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.500]  know, so those bamboos serve a couple of purposes.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.060]  Jesse brought up, I'll go ahead.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.420]  You might be leading to what I was going to say.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.780]  If they ever tripped and fell on some, you know,
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.780]  it worked good for the VC.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.280]  So,
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:05.980]  a great point.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:09.340]  Jesse brought up earlier, guys, be friends with your neighbors, be a friendly,
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.940]  polite, courteous neighbor.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:14.860]  Keep your yard clean, keep your backyard clean, keep your music down, keep your
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.420]  grow discreet and make friends with your neighbors.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:22.660]  And if you think they're legit, you can almost let them know you're growing and
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.900]  not have to hide that shit and maybe share with them, smoke out your neighbor.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.660]  And then they'll know that that dink crop in the backyard, they got to keep an
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.260]  eye on it too.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.380]  And then maybe they won't steal it from you because some neighbors will check
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:33.880]  your shit.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.620]  But then maybe if someone does come in the yard, they'll help you out.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:36.940]  Also.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.180]  They'll keep an eye on that shit because they know that, uh, they've been keeping
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:40.700]  an eye on it.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.020]  Maybe you'll throw them an ounce or two when it gets done.
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.820]  Maybe they'll come over and help you trim, you know, our neighbors on the
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.660]  farmer like that.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.940]  That's yeah.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:49.940]  That's far neighbors.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.740]  That should be that way.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:51.940]  That's a little different.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.180]  You guys aren't living in the city.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.540]  So yeah, it's a whole new ball game now.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.940]  So I made a little spike shape on my paper here to remind me to talk about
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.220]  something.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:04.100]  A lot of you guys are going to set some kind of weird booby traps or some kind of
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.780]  things for the thieves to get hurt.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.500]  Don't do that.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:06.900]  Yeah.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.020]  We can't condone that.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.740]  Uh, that's just like shooting somebody.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.940]  It's just like letting your dogs out.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.540]  You're going to get in trouble for that.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.100]  You can get manslaughter.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.740]  Uh, I think it's also 10 places called man trapping.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.140]  Um, don't, don't do it.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.080]  Yeah.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.260]  And it really, really pisses cops off when they see it.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.660]  Cause they think, Oh, I could have stepped in that.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:30.140]  That's especially if you're in an illegal state.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.980]  What if they, what if they arrest you at the front door, you know, and they lead
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.220]  you to the car and they just go walking around back and it's dark, you know what
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:37.720]  I mean?
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.220]  Just step on whatever you put.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.980]  And then you just assaulted a police officer.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.520]  Yes.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.980]  Not, not doing anything.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.740]  You're handcuffed.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.280]  Yep.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:45.540]  Completely.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.420]  That's if, if you're doing things like this, that's, you've probably got a
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.860]  substantial crop and, uh, you're probably doing a lot of things wrong and you're
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:56.780]  not really doing anyone but yourself.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.220]  There's those, uh, somebody showed me a Google map.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.700]  I might've talked about this, a Google map where there's a community in NorCal
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.900]  where you can tell the same dude set up like seven lots of housing or it's like
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.300]  Jesse owns one lot.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.780]  Adam owns another, I own another, but since we're all allowed to have them,
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.740]  yeah, they just subdivided all this land and set up gigantic crops and it looks
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:19.860]  like you built all of them.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.900]  It looks like one guy set up all these crops for all these families.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.420]  So those guys have a lot on the line, man.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.740]  What if somebody goes in there and tries to take 10 of those plants?
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.300]  They've got a lot to fucking lose.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.060]  Those are five, 10 pound plants each.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.600]  Yeah.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.820]  But I would, I would hope at that point of scale, you know, you can pay two dudes
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:45.140]  to sit around with flashlights like, Hey, I don't even want to set up the scene for
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.580]  a shitty movie, but that's a lot of money on that mountain, bro.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.480]  Yeah.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.120]  There's a short window when it's done and not harvested, but could be cut when the
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.360]  growers are trying to let it get that final few days.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:55.860]  Yeah.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.380]  Yeah, man.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.360]  Just a few, the three of us could, and it always seems to go then.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.200]  Can you imagine the amount of work?
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.120]  I mean, all of the, the, the, how stressed out you are.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.880]  Sorry to cut you off.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.640]  No, you're good.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.400]  I'm horrible about cutting people.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.800]  Uh, could you imagine just like all the, the, all the tension in your head?
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.340]  Yeah.
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.660]  You show up that morning like, uh, good to get, Oh shit.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.180]  Is that half an acre of plants just missing?
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.260]  Oh, so another thing that can help you from getting ripped off.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.420]  I wrote this real big.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.180]  We talked about it.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.140]  Be discreet.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.540]  Always quit showing everybody quit talking about it.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:38.140]  Uh, it's so much fun to post Instagram pictures and shit though, man.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.300]  But, um, yeah, but there's a way to take pride in your work though.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:48.700]  You know, like save all those pictures until the stuff is done, you know, and
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.300]  then maybe say, look what, you know, this is the buildup you don't have to post
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.460]  to Instagram under your real fucking name either.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.420]  I'm not even going to call out a couple of people that do it, but I know where
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.740]  you live and I know where your backyard's located and I see those
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.340]  gigantic plants on your Instagram.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.700]  I'm a nice guy.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.780]  Not all of your friends on your friends list are.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:06.760]  Yep.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:07.900]  That sucks.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.480]  Yeah.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.000]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.340]  I just think I have mine on a select few.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.580]  That's taunting people.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.280]  Yep.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:14.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.180]  Don't show G a lot geographical landmarks in your pictures.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:18.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.700]  Tell her your house stuff like that.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.540]  The mountain in the background.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.080]  Yeah.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:23.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.220]  All right. You guys got anything to add?
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.100]  Uh, we're going to finish this part up if these guys don't have anything to add.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.940]  And then Adam and I are going to come back.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.060]  We're going to go, we're recording on a fucking Thursday right now.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.580]  Saturday, Adam and another friend and I are going to go see Joe Rogan at the
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.940]  comedy works in Denver.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.500]  No crack.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.040]  Joe Rogan.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.260]  I don't think we're going to do that, but that is what Adam just said with a
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.140]  funny look on his face.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.380]  We were definitely going to be, uh, Joe Rogan is recording his next comedy
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.060]  central special at comedy works Saturday night.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.180]  And I was lucky enough to score some tickets.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.940]  So, uh, and thank you by the way.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.500]  I mean, I can't thank you enough.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.040]  Yeah.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.420]  Um, you're going to see some IRI genetic shirts in the crowd when I watch the
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:05.920]  show.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.900]  I was trying to say, and you know what I got told?
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.400]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.640]  I said they're 20 bucks.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.180]  Yeah.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.160]  So I'm looking for that 20 bucks.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.320]  So as I find that, then we'll get to our genetics.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.960]  But if you guys, so Adam and I will be back in a couple of minutes.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.320]  We're going to take a couple of dabs and wrap up this portion of the show.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.480]  If you guys got anything fun to say for the end of this part, go ahead and shout
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:25.980]  it out right now.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.000]  If you want to shout out anybody cool, if you want to get, I did not get to shout
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.960]  out to people that listen, uh, back East, uh, my homie stumps and QP James.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.080]  I know they both listened.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.480]  So who's Dick foot.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.680]  Is that one of your feet?
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.600]  I don't, I don't know a Dick foot.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.440]  Shout out Dick foot.

[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.040]  And, uh, of course that apothecary that you, you know, you recommended said my
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.040]  mom said she's really helping her out.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.680]  So good.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.340]  Good.

[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.960]  Whatever time he could, he could do it.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:33.480]  Yeah.

[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.960]  So hope I'm not touching on a sore subject there.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.840]  Shout out to her either way.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.080]  She was always fun to dab with.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.560]  All right, guys, it looks like it's time to wrap up the dab portion of the show.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.240]  I am going to give one quick shout out to dreadful J what's up mama.

[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.040]  Hey, Adam, did you learn anything, bro?
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:45.960]  I sure did, man.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.280]  You look like you're dabbed out over there.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.200]  I'm fucking high.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:48.600]  Nice.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:48.920]  Nice.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.360]  Speaking of fucking high, we had a super great time last night.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.840]  Uh, Adam, myself and a little friend of ours got to go see Joe Rogan record his
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:02.720]  next, uh, standup comedy special for comedy central at comedy works.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.120]  Uh, what'd you think of that show, bro?
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.800]  It was awesome, dude.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.800]  I've never seen a professional comic, so to say, you know what I'm saying?
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.440]  Besides when we went up to Denver, but it was great, man.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.840]  I woke up in my cheeks and my ribs were still sore from laughing so hard.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.240]  Absolutely.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:17.960]  My cheeks.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:18.440]  Yeah.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:18.840]  Yeah.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.000]  Uh, Tony Hinchcliffe opened up for Joe Rogan at comedy works last night.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.080]  Uh, he did 15 solid minutes.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.960]  Every second of his set was ripping.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.440]  Yep.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.680]  It was, he was a funny dude.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.520]  I've never heard of him before, but he was definitely an interesting comic.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.800]  Uh, he's a little dark.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.680]  He's a little twisted.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.000]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.080]  And, uh, that's your grin and you're like, yeah, that's right up our alley.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.120]  So that was perfect.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.200]  And then, uh, of course, Joe Rogan is a legend.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.560]  Uh, he crushed it.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.080]  Yeah.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.680]  Uh, he came out a little bit nervous.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.920]  I felt like, but he used it.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.120]  He harnessed that.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.080]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.760]  He grabbed that energy and then somebody tried to heckle Joe
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.560]  Rogan about 10 minutes into his set.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.680]  And that's when he calmed.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.920]  He totally broke free of the bubble of I'm recording a show.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.920]  And he kind of chewed that lady a tiny bit of a chewing of a new asshole.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.800]  He just made her feel really stupid for a second, like a comedian should do.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.240]  And went back about his business.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.040]  Uh, I had a hell of a good time.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.240]  So shout out to Joe Rogan.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.320]  Uh, that was, that's going to be a great comedy special.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.080]  Comedy Works is a, is a great setting, man.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.400]  Like it's a great place.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.240]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.480]  Uh, we eat dinner at a place called the something mushroom.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.320]  Do you remember the name, bro?
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.560]  The mellow mushroom.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.520]  Mellow mushroom.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:22.760]  Yeah.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.840]  That place was dank.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.120]  That pizza was delicious.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.440]  Our server was pretty chill.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.240]  It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had for sure.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.680]  And I'm not really a big pizza fan.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:31.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.280]  Uh, you ate all the way to the end of the crust and everything, right?
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.040]  I ate all of it.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:35.360]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.080]  We, we killed that large pizza between the three of us.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.200]  It should have been enough pizza for four people, but three high people.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.400]  Had nothing to do with your dabs before the show, the pregame, but hey, whatever.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.440]  That was a good time.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:46.960]  Hey, shout out.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.920]  If you're listening, a guy named Phil approached me after the comedy show.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.600]  And he asked me if I was the guy that owns the seed company.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.080]  Cause I mean, I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks and I'm wearing it, wearing
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.600]  an IRIE genetics t-shirt in the middle of downtown Denver.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.960]  Uh, he's like, do you own that seed company?
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.920]  I was like, that's me, dude.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.920]  So Phil, if you're listening to the podcast, if you found the show, congratulations
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.080]  and thanks for your support, bro.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:07.680]  That was really cool.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.480]  Meeting somebody that, uh, just knew me from my seed company and my
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.880]  Instagram and Facebook presence.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.600]  That was kind of cool.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.880]  So shout out to Phil.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.720]  Uh, bro, do you have anybody you need to give a shout out to in this episode?
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.880]  Um, no, man, that's, that's pretty much it.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.760]  The guys I hit up.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.440]  Cool.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.000]  Uh, I feel like we kind of rambled on the Joe Rogan part for a second.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.320]  Shout out to our friend, Angela.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.240]  They got to join us.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.760]  I had a good time with the Angela.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.080]  Thanks for coming to pizza and being a really cool passenger.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:31.600]  That was fun.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.320]  Uh, I guess we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.240]  Uh, if you guys ever get to go see a show at comedy works, uh, go check it out.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:38.840]  It's a good time.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.920]  Doug Benson will be there.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.400]  Look, I'm giving Doug Benson a plug.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.800]  Uh, Doug Benson will be there.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.720]  If you guys are pot smokers and you live in Colorado, go see
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.880]  Doug Benson at comedy works.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.800]  I think the date is September 15th.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.560]  It's a Monday.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.120]  Uh, I will be there.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.480]  Um, maybe we can arrange a little smoke session.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.720]  So let me know if you want to do that.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.760]  Tweet me about it at I grow culture on Twitter or email me.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.360]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.400]  Or of course, find me on Facebook under I grow culture.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.840]  And we will, uh, we can smoke out at the Doug Benson show after the show.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.280]  Not in there.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.440]  You can't smoke in comedy works.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.080]  They will kick you the fuck out.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.720]  I've got a note here that says, watch your mouth.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.680]  Uh, I'm trying not to watch, or I'm trying not to cuss so much.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.040]  I know that's one of my downfalls of being a great podcaster.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.320]  Uh, I'll quit saying the F word a lot because, uh, it's really not good
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.720]  class or not good taste.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.840]  So I'm going to try to quit.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.160]  I, on the other hand, you can talk like a fucking pirate.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.480]  If you want, you're not the host of a show.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:31.760]  Arrgh.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.720]  Arrgh.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.440]  Shout out to all of our pirate friends.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.200]  All right, guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.800]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.280]  Search for I grow culture.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.520]  Find the review section.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.320]  Give us a five-star rating after that type in a comment and let me
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320]  know what you think of the show.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.920]  If you're listening to us on Stitcher, please leave a comment
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.120]  there and give us a good review.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.880]  Now all those reviews help the show move up in the rankings, which
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.440]  in turn gets us more listeners.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.040]  Uh, I want to spread my message to everyone who needs help
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.560]  or wants grow information.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.800]  Uh, we have about a thousand listeners on the past couple of few episodes.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.120]  We've created a thousand people are hearing us.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.880]  I think 1100, uh, listeners on episode 24.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.480]  By the time I looked, uh, the stats are a few days behind because it takes a
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.920]  minute for the analytics to get there.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.040]  But there were 1100 listeners on episode 24, and this is the night we're recording 26.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.240]  So it takes them two weeks and we get 1100.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.400]  And the first week we usually get about 800 listens and the
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.840]  first week an episode is posted.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.400]  So I want to give that's so awesome.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.000]  That's a lot of people hearing our message.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.440]  So I want to give a huge thank you to all 1100 of you that are listening.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.160]  Absolutely.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.240]  But I want you guys to do me one favor.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.280]  1100 of you are listening.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.320]  Everybody tell two of your friends about the I Grow Culture podcast.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.560]  Just say, man, I was, you know, everybody grows, smokes, loves
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.720]  weed, has something to do with weed.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.800]  You all know two stoners.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.680]  Or if it's your mom and she's afraid of weed, she can listen to us.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.440]  Be semi-educated and we're good people.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.880]  We preach a good message on the last part with Jesse, we said, don't shoot people.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:00.760]  Absolutely.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.560]  So we're good people.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.960]  You can, you can break myths.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.920]  You can educate people.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.720]  You can, if somebody's lonely and wants something to listen to,
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.320]  we've got great radio voices.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.240]  I'm just fucking kidding.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.720]  Absolutely educate people anytime you can.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.320]  But yeah, you can spread the word.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.480]  So all 1100 of you, a thousand of you, 1500 by the time this episode posts,
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.960]  all of you guys tell two people.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.280]  And that way, if one of them listens to the show, then we got 3000 listeners.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.720]  And that's when iTunes and Stitcher really start paying attention.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.400]  Once you break that 2,500 marker.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.360]  And that's, that's all the ratings is really doing.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.960]  I mean, it tells people that the show is good, but more than anything else, it
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:41.080]  helps your relationship with iTunes or Stitcher, but when it moves us up in the
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.000]  ranking, it shows people that we exist.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.880]  And then it's like, uh, it's just, our brand has more integrity.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.840]  Uh, if more people are listening, people say, oh, people are listening.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.880]  It must be worth listening.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.080]  And so, you know, nobody, you know, when you're seeing a killer band, nobody
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.360]  wants to dance until that first idiot dances, just dance guys.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:57.840]  Yep.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.240]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.520]  If anything that I've learned from Colorado, it's just get out there and
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.520]  dance because there are people far behind.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:03.880]  Yeah.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.240]  Yeah.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.880]  Uh, nobody wants to be the first dancer, but those fifth and 10th dancers, those
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.840]  guys are all going to love you for breaking the ice.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.880]  So just, let's just, I'm not begging.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.920]  I just want to, you know, let's just get the show moved up there.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.400]  And that way more people love, man.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.960]  More people can learn how to grow high grade cannabis.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.360]  Less people will be afraid of cannabis and more people will be properly
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.120]  educated about cannabis and the things that go with cannabis.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.560]  That's my goal.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.520]  I want to, you preach a good message, brother.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.400]  I want to big up the weed.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.120]  Well, it's, I feel like I'm a, an ambassador to the plant now, to the
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.360]  whole industry and to the movement.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.520]  I kind of speak, I'm, I'm the voice, you know, there's a few of us that have
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.440]  podcasts and we're starting to be recognized and I want to be, uh, you're
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.000]  helping very positive for the plant.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.120]  Yeah.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.600]  I don't want to be a bad vibe for the plant.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.400]  I don't want people to think I'm a stupid pothead.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.160]  People do.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.600]  Cause I take fucking gram dabs and I have dreadlocks, but that's just that,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.920]  you know, you prove them wrong every day.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.600]  Well, thank you.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.960]  That's really appreciated guys.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.040]  I thank you guys all for listening.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.360]  I'm ranting and rambling again.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:00.360]  So, uh, don't forget the show's available on iTunes, Stitcher, swell.am.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.760]  And also every episode all the way from episode one is on
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760]  iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.840]  Somebody told me today, a friend of mine that I just met in person today.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.440]  Another listener.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.200]  What's up, Dustin?
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:10.800]  Shout out, bro.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.640]  Uh, Dustin was saying he listens to episode.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.960]  He was listening to episodes one and two, and he's starting to go from the very
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.000]  beginning and he will catch up while he gardens.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:19.920]  So what's up, bro.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.320]  And quite a while you'll hear this, this shout out on number 26, 26, 27, 26.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:26.520]  Yeah.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.280]  We're on 26.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.040]  All right.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.760]  So, uh, what do we do at the end?
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.960]  We give a big old shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.480]  What's up, bro.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:32.760]  I love you.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.960]  I was supposed to come hang out tonight.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.680]  I got tied up doing a podcast.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.240]  We went a little later than expected.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.760]  So a big shout out to my ninja Spence in the garden of Whedon.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:40.760]  Huge.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.920]  Thanks again to all the listeners.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.920]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Take a fat dab.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.120]  Hey Adam, thanks for coming.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.520]  Uh, so take a fat dab.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.840]  Give your mama a hug for me.
