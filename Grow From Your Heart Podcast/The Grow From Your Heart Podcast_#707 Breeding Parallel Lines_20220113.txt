[01:37.820 --> 01:40.220]  and easy for all of my friends.
[01:40.220 --> 01:41.220]  All right.
[01:41.220 --> 01:44.020]  I don't want to ramble too much here at the start of the show.
[01:44.020 --> 01:46.220]  Recently I was on my Instagram live feed.
[01:46.220 --> 01:47.220]  That's right.
[01:47.220 --> 01:51.020]  Every Monday I do an Instagram live at 7 10 PM Mountain Time.
[01:51.020 --> 01:52.180]  I'm in Colorado.
[01:52.180 --> 01:54.100]  I'm dealing with the mountain time zone.
[01:54.100 --> 01:58.100]  So every Monday 7 10 PM Mountain Time I do an Instagram live.
[01:58.100 --> 01:59.820]  I'm on my Instagram account.
[01:59.820 --> 02:01.520]  Iree underscore genetics.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.860]  That is me on Instagram.
[02:02.860 --> 02:04.700]  Iree underscore genetics.
[02:04.700 --> 02:06.180]  I use that one for the live feed.
[02:06.180 --> 02:08.340]  There is a podcast on Instagram.
[02:08.340 --> 02:09.900]  It is the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:09.900 --> 02:11.540]  I don't post enough there.
[02:11.540 --> 02:12.660]  I try but I don't.
[02:12.660 --> 02:14.540]  Iree underscore genetics on Instagram.
[02:14.540 --> 02:18.460]  I do an Instagram live show every Monday on a recent live show.
[02:18.460 --> 02:22.540]  We started talking about labeling and going deeper into labeling and somebody asked me
[02:22.540 --> 02:27.560]  the question about F ones and then they asked me the question about what does V mean.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.260]  Somebody noted that the letter V was on a seed pack.
[02:31.260 --> 02:32.940]  Previously we talked about the BX.
[02:32.940 --> 02:33.980]  We talked about F1.
[02:33.980 --> 02:38.100]  We talked about S. Now we are going to talk about V and we're going to lead that into
[02:38.100 --> 02:40.420]  further breeding down the line.
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.220]  We're going to talk about parallel breeding in this episode.
[02:43.220 --> 02:47.660]  So let's start the conversation off talking about V. If you buy a package of seeds and
[02:47.660 --> 02:51.720]  it's got the letter V marked on there somewhere that can be very confusing.
[02:51.720 --> 02:53.700]  What does the letter V mean?
[02:53.700 --> 02:56.300]  I did not see the package that my friend was talking about.
[02:56.300 --> 03:00.780]  I'm not exactly sure but I have a good idea of exactly the breeder.
[03:00.780 --> 03:05.260]  The line of seeds that it came from so I can give a good example of what I expect and
[03:05.260 --> 03:10.060]  I assume this V means the V means it is a version.
[03:10.060 --> 03:15.940]  So let's just say hypothetically that I made a rise F twos and the, uh, there were different
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.140]  phenotypes that I liked.
[03:17.140 --> 03:22.660]  I would run a bunch of seeds and I would label them, uh, probably number one through 25 or
[03:22.660 --> 03:25.860]  one through a hundred or maybe they would be letters a through Z.
[03:25.860 --> 03:29.520]  Just kind of depends on how I'm feeling when I label, make the labels that day.
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.960]  In this case, we're going to say they were labeled numbers, uh, one through 25 and then
[03:33.960 --> 03:35.280]  I'm going to grow those out.
[03:35.280 --> 03:40.360]  I may find two that I really like that have two totally distinct, uh, traits, features,
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.240]  uh, two different phenotypes that really, uh, they're both keepers in totally different
[03:45.240 --> 03:46.240]  ways.
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.640]  So I may work more with those plants in the future and to indicate that, uh, I chose,
[03:51.640 --> 03:56.000]  uh, maybe I got an arise plant that was super sticky and super potent and then maybe I got
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.040]  another arise plant that tastes really good and grows really fast.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.360]  I would indicate those by saying like version a and version B and then on the website I
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.360]  would go and indicate very clearly the differences between version a and version B.
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.260]  Uh, so I think the V just means version.
[04:12.260 --> 04:17.720]  It's either a version a or version B possibly version 2.0 is something I've also seen the
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.380]  way that I have indicated that is I've just simply given the plants different numbers.
[04:21.380 --> 04:26.060]  You may see a rise F two number four arise F two number eight.
[04:26.060 --> 04:29.780]  There's a rise F two, a letter E. That is the way I did it.
[04:29.780 --> 04:34.900]  Those are different selections of the arise phenotypes that I chose to continue breeding
[04:34.900 --> 04:35.900]  with.
[04:35.900 --> 04:38.540]  That is all that indicates is a V for version.
[04:38.540 --> 04:39.580]  All right.
[04:39.580 --> 04:41.700]  I am back after a quick technical adjustment.
[04:41.700 --> 04:44.340]  I hope you didn't notice through the magic of editing.
[04:44.340 --> 04:45.660]  You will not notice a thing.
[04:45.660 --> 04:46.780]  Let's stay on track here.
[04:46.780 --> 04:48.420]  I talked about versions.
[04:48.420 --> 04:54.740]  I did say I was going to talk about a polyhybrids F ones and breeding parallel lines.
[04:54.740 --> 04:57.420]  I'm going to try to unravel that ball.
[04:57.420 --> 04:58.420]  Here we go.
[04:58.420 --> 05:03.780]  Oftentimes in the show I talk about F ones and F one is known as when we take two plants
[05:03.780 --> 05:06.380]  and cross them together for the first time.
[05:06.380 --> 05:11.220]  If I take plant a that doesn't even need a name and plant B and I breed them together,
[05:11.220 --> 05:13.940]  the seeds that come from that, that's called the progeny.
[05:13.940 --> 05:14.940]  That is an F one.
[05:14.940 --> 05:17.980]  That is the first filial generation.
[05:18.540 --> 05:23.580]  Now my friend F one Pete, his head just completely exploded because unless we've done some work
[05:23.580 --> 05:28.820]  before that or some very careful selection that is not really an F one, it could be labeled
[05:28.820 --> 05:30.220]  an F one.
[05:30.220 --> 05:32.740]  Technically what we just made is a polyhybrid.
[05:32.740 --> 05:33.820]  We're just pollen chucking.
[05:33.820 --> 05:38.340]  We're just grabbing plant a plant B, putting them in a room because that one was called
[05:38.340 --> 05:41.060]  something cookies and that was called something cake.
[05:41.060 --> 05:44.900]  And I think that something cookies and something cake would be a cool fucking strain name that
[05:44.900 --> 05:46.460]  will sell me a lot of seeds.
[05:46.460 --> 05:50.180]  So I put them in a room and I let them fuck and now I got a bunch of seeds and those are
[05:50.180 --> 05:52.760]  just polyhybrid hype seeds.
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.140]  If you're into polyhybrids, there's nothing wrong with that.
[05:55.140 --> 05:58.260]  If you've done, if that's what you want, that's your thing.
[05:58.260 --> 05:59.740]  But that is not an F one.
[05:59.740 --> 06:04.820]  Let's talk about what would make an F one and what the difference is between a polyhybrid
[06:04.820 --> 06:05.820]  and an F one.
[06:05.820 --> 06:11.200]  The main word is I'm breeding to the main thing is breeding to heterozygous plants together
[06:11.200 --> 06:12.920]  to create an F one.
[06:12.920 --> 06:17.560]  If you're taking something that's really a OG Kush dominant and a lot of Kush on this
[06:17.560 --> 06:21.040]  side and a lot of Kush on this side, you're just kind of pollen chucking and putting Kush
[06:21.040 --> 06:22.880]  and other ingredients together.
[06:22.880 --> 06:24.680]  Let's do some work, do some building blocks.
[06:24.680 --> 06:29.520]  Let's talk about how to do this and this will also take us back to the versions.
[06:29.520 --> 06:33.680]  So the main, when I'm breeding, one of the things I really look for is breeding plants
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.680]  that are different.
[06:34.680 --> 06:38.760]  Why would I want to take two strawberries and make strawberries together and get double
[06:38.760 --> 06:39.760]  strawberries?
[06:39.760 --> 06:40.760]  That doesn't make any sense to me.
[06:40.760 --> 06:44.840]  I don't want to take strawberries and blueberries or strawberries and chocolate or strawberries
[06:44.840 --> 06:47.520]  and not even bananas because that's too cliche.
[06:47.520 --> 06:49.360]  How about strawberries and garlic?
[06:49.360 --> 06:50.760]  Let's just fuck it all up.
[06:50.760 --> 06:54.600]  Let's do things weird and breed that and try to compliment both plants and see what they
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.840]  both do.
[06:55.840 --> 06:58.120]  Also that helps us get to that F one stage.
[06:58.120 --> 07:01.960]  So in my example, again, I'm going to go back to making a rise.
[07:01.960 --> 07:06.880]  We're going to work with a golden goat female and we're going to focus on a daybreaker male.
[07:06.880 --> 07:07.920]  That's where we're going to go.
[07:07.960 --> 07:11.200]  I'm going to flower them out and I'm going to get pollen from the daybreaker.
[07:11.200 --> 07:14.600]  I'm going to put the pollen on the golden goat female.
[07:14.600 --> 07:17.160]  I have now made a rise F one.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.840]  That is a real thing that I've done.
[07:18.840 --> 07:21.520]  I've called that a rise F one.
[07:21.520 --> 07:24.480]  That could be debatably an F one debatable.
[07:24.480 --> 07:25.960]  You could debate it if you want to.
[07:25.960 --> 07:28.080]  Also that may not be a true F one.
[07:28.080 --> 07:30.160]  It may be.
[07:30.160 --> 07:35.080]  Those plants were so far apart, I think in appearance, in genetics and everything that
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.080]  I think I made an F one.
[07:38.080 --> 07:41.680]  Maybe people would argue that and I would accept your argument.
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.640]  They could be a polyhybrid if you want to call it that.
[07:44.640 --> 07:50.000]  Let's talk about what I could do to further turn this plant into a true F one.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.240]  If we want to really fit that label that our friend FPF one P would like to see this plant
[07:54.240 --> 07:55.240]  fall into.
[07:55.240 --> 07:59.520]  Shout out to my friend F one P. You're a very inspiring, a very knowledgeable dude and you
[07:59.520 --> 08:01.760]  did inspire a lot of this and I learned a lot from you brother.
[08:01.760 --> 08:02.760]  So thank you.
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.760]  Let's keep going.
[08:04.040 --> 08:08.560]  I've got my first arise F one or my polyhybrid stash of seeds.
[08:08.560 --> 08:10.960]  From there I'm going to find a male.
[08:10.960 --> 08:12.680]  Let's go back to talking about the versions.
[08:12.680 --> 08:14.080]  This is where the versions are going to come in.
[08:14.080 --> 08:16.120]  Let me keep myself on track from there.
[08:16.120 --> 08:19.380]  I'm going to grow them out and I'm going to find traits that I really enjoy.
[08:19.380 --> 08:23.080]  This is just what you do when you get seeds, a batch of new seeds, you grow them, you look
[08:23.080 --> 08:24.080]  for the traits.
[08:24.080 --> 08:27.320]  What are these new, what are this, what is the progeny express?
[08:27.320 --> 08:31.000]  You grow as many as you can and through that population you take a lot of notes and you
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.860]  say this is a common trait.
[08:32.860 --> 08:33.980]  This is a common trait.
[08:33.980 --> 08:34.980]  This is really common.
[08:34.980 --> 08:41.460]  25% of the plants show me this 25 show me this 50% of the plants show me this 10% of
[08:41.460 --> 08:43.620]  the plants did this weird shit over here.
[08:43.620 --> 08:46.860]  10% of the plants did this amazing thing over here.
[08:46.860 --> 08:49.280]  Take a lot of notes and see what you have created.
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.100]  Put that plant in different environments, stress it out, run it as many times as you
[08:53.100 --> 08:54.100]  can.
[08:54.100 --> 08:56.860]  See what you can do with this plant, how it reacts to different things.
[08:56.860 --> 09:01.940]  Then then if you really want to go further, find a, there are going to be two different
[09:01.940 --> 09:04.260]  traits that you like, two different plants that you're looking for.
[09:04.260 --> 09:06.580]  I'm going to pick two very specific traits.
[09:06.580 --> 09:11.940]  Once again, we're going to say on this side, we have found a plant that is super potent.
[09:11.940 --> 09:15.620]  Every time we smoke it, I said this before, your brain flies out of your head.
[09:15.620 --> 09:17.580]  You got fireworks going off every time.
[09:17.580 --> 09:20.380]  We're going to stick with a super potent plant on this side.
[09:20.380 --> 09:23.540]  On the other side, I'm going to stick with something we all enjoy.
[09:23.540 --> 09:28.380]  Terps flavor, whatever your favorite flavor is that is on this side.
[09:28.380 --> 09:33.780]  So I've got one line of plants that are nothing but potency and one breeding project that
[09:33.780 --> 09:35.200]  is nothing but flavor.
[09:35.200 --> 09:36.620]  An easy way to achieve this.
[09:36.620 --> 09:40.900]  One way we can do this is to use the same male or two different males.
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.940]  If you found two males that you really like, you want to run two totally different breeding
[09:44.940 --> 09:46.980]  projects that is acceptable.
[09:46.980 --> 09:48.460]  That's a great way to do this.
[09:48.460 --> 09:50.420]  You can run one male or two males.
[09:50.420 --> 09:51.940]  This will work however you want.
[09:51.940 --> 09:55.020]  As long as you have found the plants that meet the criteria and reach the goals you
[09:55.020 --> 09:58.660]  were looking for, you can do two different males or the same male.
[09:58.660 --> 10:01.080]  That won't make a difference in my opinion.
[10:01.080 --> 10:04.820]  So what we're going to do, we're going to find that female super potent, find another
[10:04.820 --> 10:06.860]  female super flavor.
[10:06.860 --> 10:09.120]  Then we're going to pollinate them with our male of choice.
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.020]  It's either, it's got to be the same filial generation is the most important part here.
[10:13.020 --> 10:17.980]  It could be the same male, could be two different males as long as they came from the same batch
[10:17.980 --> 10:19.100]  of seeds.
[10:19.100 --> 10:23.020]  So now we are going to find that perfect male, that perfect, perfect male.
[10:23.020 --> 10:25.380]  If it's one or two, find our perfect females.
[10:25.380 --> 10:29.100]  We've got our female A and female B. Now we're going to pollinate.
[10:29.100 --> 10:32.940]  At this point we have made two separate batches of F2 seeds.
[10:32.940 --> 10:38.620]  We have made F2 batch A and F2 batch B. You can do this at separate times.
[10:38.620 --> 10:42.300]  If you've got, if you're doing different males, you might want to do it in separate rooms
[10:42.300 --> 10:44.620]  at different times so you don't cross pollinate.
[10:44.620 --> 10:47.440]  If you're using one male, you can do this in one room.
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.220]  You can pollinate plant A and plant B as long as you don't mix up the seeds when you're
[10:51.220 --> 10:53.280]  done, that will work out beautifully.
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.420]  So what you would do, what I would do, you've made the F1 or the polyhybrid generation,
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.740]  find a solid male.
[10:59.740 --> 11:02.220]  In this case, I found King Solomon.
[11:02.220 --> 11:06.980]  Then I would find a female, nothing but potency, a female over here, nothing but turps.
[11:06.980 --> 11:09.220]  I keep saying nothing but, that's wrong.
[11:09.220 --> 11:10.340]  I shouldn't be saying it that way.
[11:10.340 --> 11:17.220]  We want structure, vigor, pathogen resistance, bug resistance, all of the other things you
[11:17.220 --> 11:19.420]  desire in a plant that you're going to breed to.
[11:19.420 --> 11:20.420]  It needs that.
[11:20.420 --> 11:25.540]  So let's focus, 90% of your focus is going to be on the trichomes, on the potency over
[11:25.540 --> 11:26.540]  here.
[11:26.540 --> 11:28.940]  I don't know about 90, I'm exaggerating that, that's hyperbole.
[11:28.940 --> 11:31.740]  Most of our focus, we're breeding mostly for potency over here.
[11:31.740 --> 11:34.460]  The other side breeding mostly for flavor.
[11:34.460 --> 11:36.660]  So you're going to get your, you're going to select that.
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.180]  You're going to have your male.
[11:38.180 --> 11:41.100]  Then I would take that male and pollinate both of those.
[11:41.100 --> 11:46.460]  Now I have now made the F2 or I guess it's the F2, but not really the true F2 working
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.740]  toward our real F1 is where we're headed.
[11:48.740 --> 11:49.820]  We'll get to that.
[11:49.820 --> 11:51.700]  So I'm going to make new seeds.
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.220]  I'm going to take this batch over here that I'm breeding just for flavor.
[11:55.220 --> 11:58.780]  And I'm going to find another boy and another girl out of there.
[11:58.780 --> 12:05.180]  In this selection process, I am focused once again on structure, vigor, resistance to problems,
[12:05.180 --> 12:08.820]  but I'm focusing mainly on flavor once again.
[12:08.820 --> 12:09.820]  Then guess what?
[12:09.820 --> 12:13.340]  Once I found that perfect male and perfect female out of my F2 batch of this batch of
[12:13.340 --> 12:17.900]  seeds out of batch A, I don't remember which side was batch A and which side was batch
[12:17.900 --> 12:21.300]  B, but we're just going to act like this is flavor batch over here.
[12:21.300 --> 12:22.300]  We've got our F2s.
[12:22.300 --> 12:23.580]  We're going to make F3.
[12:23.580 --> 12:27.180]  We're going to find a beautiful flavored plant again, and we're going to make F4.
[12:27.180 --> 12:30.740]  We're going to go all the way to F5 or F6.
[12:30.740 --> 12:32.860]  I want to go until these plants come out.
[12:32.860 --> 12:36.540]  Every time I grow them, they are stable.
[12:36.540 --> 12:40.340]  Stability means that all of the plants are uniform, uniformity among phenotypes.
[12:40.340 --> 12:45.020]  We're not going to find a bunch of different phenotypes in the population.
[12:45.020 --> 12:46.300]  Not going to be any differences.
[12:46.620 --> 12:48.940]  They're going to look like we put a bunch of clones out there.
[12:48.940 --> 12:50.060]  That's how far I'm going to breed it.
[12:50.060 --> 12:53.220]  If I do my selection properly, F5 should get me there.
[12:53.220 --> 12:55.500]  F6 will really lock it in.
[12:55.500 --> 12:59.300]  What are we going to do with these other plants that were focused on the potency side?
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.300]  Same thing.
[13:00.300 --> 13:01.300]  I've got my F1 seeds.
[13:01.300 --> 13:03.180]  I'm going to find a boy and a girl.
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.180]  Cross those.
[13:04.180 --> 13:05.180]  Make F2s.
[13:05.180 --> 13:06.740]  Find a boy and a girl that are highly potent.
[13:06.740 --> 13:07.740]  Cross those.
[13:07.740 --> 13:11.220]  I keep going up like this, like there's a chart in front of me, but there is in my head.
[13:11.220 --> 13:13.580]  I'm going to do that to both lines.
[13:13.580 --> 13:15.780]  This is what I'm calling parallel lines.
[13:15.780 --> 13:16.940]  It's the same genetics.
[13:16.940 --> 13:17.940]  It's the same cross.
[13:17.940 --> 13:22.820]  It's the same genotype, but I'm choosing different phenotypes with different goals in mind for
[13:22.820 --> 13:24.060]  my breeding.
[13:24.060 --> 13:29.780]  Once again, I'm just breeding for potency, just breeding for flavor in two separate projects.
[13:29.780 --> 13:35.500]  I've got to use the same batch of seeds over here to make this work and the same, the batch
[13:35.500 --> 13:38.580]  of seeds over here that is allotted for this project over here.
[13:38.580 --> 13:41.580]  The potency seeds have to stay in the potency rain.
[13:41.580 --> 13:46.060]  The flavor seeds have to stay in the flavor rain and run right up that side of the chart.
[13:46.060 --> 13:51.620]  We're going to F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, both of them right up each side.
[13:51.620 --> 13:56.080]  Then once we get to that F5, F6 level and we feel like we've got exactly what we're
[13:56.080 --> 14:02.900]  looking for from our phenotypes, we're going to find a beautifully, perfectly structured,
[14:02.900 --> 14:08.820]  pathogen resistant, bug resistant, not problematic plant that is ideal for our grow room that
[14:08.820 --> 14:12.780]  is got the most amazing fucking flavor you could ever find.
[14:12.780 --> 14:17.060]  Whatever flavor you think of when you close your eyes and you inhale that imaginary joint
[14:17.060 --> 14:22.420]  or imaginary dab or imaginary bong rip and you go, whatever flavor that is, it hits your
[14:22.420 --> 14:23.420]  tongue.
[14:23.420 --> 14:25.700]  This plant tastes just like that times five.
[14:25.700 --> 14:30.300]  It's almost overwhelming, almost overpowering because we've bred it just focusing on that
[14:30.300 --> 14:32.580]  delicious terpene content.
[14:32.580 --> 14:35.580]  Then we're going to find one over here on the other side, on the potency side.
[14:35.580 --> 14:38.440]  Then when you open the bag, you don't even have to light it.
[14:38.440 --> 14:40.040]  You don't even have to put fire on it.
[14:40.040 --> 14:41.680]  You just go, oh shit, I'm too high to drive.
[14:41.680 --> 14:43.320]  Somebody else has to drive the car.
[14:43.320 --> 14:45.400]  That's how high I want you to get from that weed.
[14:45.400 --> 14:47.640]  We're going to find a phenotype that is perfect.
[14:47.640 --> 14:48.640]  You got to trust her.
[14:48.640 --> 14:50.640]  Now, which one, which one do we choose for the male?
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.160]  I would say choose the potency side for the male.
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.160]  That would be my idea.
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.260]  But now what we're going to do, we're going to cross these together.
[14:57.260 --> 15:02.620]  We're going to take our F6s from each side or F5 from each side and pick your potency
[15:02.620 --> 15:05.840]  male and your flavorful female and cross them.
[15:05.840 --> 15:07.120]  Let's breed those together.
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.480]  Now my friends, we have made a true F1 cross.
[15:11.480 --> 15:19.160]  We've taken these parents that were Golden Goat and Daybreaker and we made the polyhybrid
[15:19.160 --> 15:21.080]  version part one.
[15:21.080 --> 15:27.560]  Then we selected version A and version B and we bred them to F2, F3, F4, F5, F6.
[15:27.560 --> 15:29.480]  We found our crown jewels out of those.
[15:29.480 --> 15:36.120]  We bred those together and we made fucking super arise the true F1.
[15:36.120 --> 15:37.560]  That would be a baddie.
[15:37.560 --> 15:40.960]  That's like a lifelong project for a lot of people.
[15:40.960 --> 15:44.560]  Don't think that that's something you should get done in just a few years.
[15:44.560 --> 15:46.880]  If you rush it, you fuck that project up.
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.980]  If you ever have to go backwards, if one of your selections wasn't what you thought it
[15:50.980 --> 15:55.400]  should be, if you liked the filial generation before, never be afraid to go back and crack
[15:55.400 --> 15:57.760]  more seeds from that generation before.
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.100]  Find the phenotype out of there.
[15:59.100 --> 16:00.580]  You know when you mess up.
[16:00.580 --> 16:01.580]  You'll see it.
[16:01.580 --> 16:04.380]  It may be two generations back, but you'll know which generation.
[16:04.380 --> 16:08.620]  Once you're breeding filial generations and you see a problem pop up, you'll go, oh yeah,
[16:08.620 --> 16:11.940]  that was in two generations back and I was too stubborn to get rid of that.
[16:11.940 --> 16:13.340]  I should have tossed that plant.
[16:13.340 --> 16:17.000]  I picked that plant because it did that other thing that I liked and I accepted the crazy
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.620]  thing just because it had that other cool trait.
[16:19.620 --> 16:21.140]  Get rid of that.
[16:21.140 --> 16:23.340]  Don't be afraid to go backwards.
[16:23.340 --> 16:27.420]  Always keep seed stock from every filial generation.
[16:27.420 --> 16:34.980]  If you're making F2s, F3s, F4s, you should have F1, 2, 3, and 4 seed stock just on reserve.
[16:34.980 --> 16:39.100]  Like I said, just in case you did not make the appropriate, the correct selection every
[16:39.100 --> 16:40.100]  time.
[16:40.100 --> 16:46.460]  Maybe later on you want to take that F6 or F5 and back cross it to an F2 or something.
[16:46.460 --> 16:51.720]  Once you start doing this, you'll see why breeding becomes so, I guess addicting is
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.720]  the word.
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.340]  Then you'll see how it also becomes very predictive.
[16:57.380 --> 17:00.740]  Once you do it a lot, you can almost anticipate what's going to come out.
[17:00.740 --> 17:05.900]  If you learn the plants, if you understand what's happening, you have to breed with the
[17:05.900 --> 17:10.940]  plants a couple of times to see how much of that male goes into the mix and how much of
[17:10.940 --> 17:12.540]  that female goes into the mix.
[17:12.540 --> 17:15.700]  Then you'll see that different males and females interact differently.
[17:15.700 --> 17:20.580]  The only way to do that really is to breed some plants.
[17:20.580 --> 17:22.620]  I guess that is my quick wrap up.
[17:22.620 --> 17:26.300]  I hope I covered that correctly and appropriately.
[17:26.300 --> 17:29.220]  I am going to get roasted on something I said there.
[17:29.220 --> 17:32.060]  Honestly, I look forward to it because that is how I learn.
[17:32.060 --> 17:36.240]  My audience holds me to a high standard and I do appreciate that.
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.420]  Don't be shy.
[17:37.420 --> 17:38.700]  Let me know what I messed up.
[17:38.700 --> 17:42.100]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:42.100 --> 17:47.220]  Send me your corrections, corrections, comments, concerns, constructive criticism, criticism,
[17:47.220 --> 17:49.860]  that also, but send me your constructive criticism.
[17:49.860 --> 17:51.700]  Please be polite about it.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.020]  I don't have any notes in front of me.
[17:53.020 --> 17:54.020]  I'll show you.
[17:54.020 --> 17:55.020]  I'll tell you what my notes have.
[17:55.020 --> 18:00.620]  It's just a graph that goes like this and it says poly slash F1 and then AB and then
[18:00.620 --> 18:04.740]  F1 all the way down to F6 is what I wrote and then a circle F1.
[18:04.740 --> 18:07.980]  I'm not going to show you my chicken scratches of notes because that's my brain and it's
[18:07.980 --> 18:10.260]  embarrassing, but that's how many notes I've got.
[18:10.260 --> 18:12.380]  I hope I got that correct.
[18:12.380 --> 18:13.380]  I've got faith in myself.
[18:13.380 --> 18:18.780]  I think that came out right, but again, I am not afraid to be corrected and educated.
[18:18.780 --> 18:20.460]  That's what we're all here for.
[18:20.460 --> 18:24.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[18:25.140 --> 18:29.740]  gutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, truly, thank
[18:29.740 --> 18:32.180]  you for listening to another Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[18:32.180 --> 18:34.740]  I feel like I was going super fast in this episode.
[18:34.740 --> 18:37.620]  I'll take a couple of more dabs before I record the next one.
[18:37.620 --> 18:39.580]  I smoked some lemon wreath from Green Dot.
[18:39.580 --> 18:44.780]  They don't pay me to advertise, but that's what got me talking 7,000 miles an hour.
[18:44.780 --> 18:46.540]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[18:46.540 --> 18:47.540]  Nothing but love.
[18:47.540 --> 18:49.900]  Also, nothing but love for our friends at Superior Seeds.
[18:49.900 --> 18:50.900]  Check them out.
[18:50.900 --> 18:52.340]  They did get a restock recently.
[18:52.340 --> 18:53.540]  Superior Seeds.
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.980]  I think it's superiorseeds.com.
[18:54.980 --> 18:57.140]  I just wrote down Superior Seeds.
[18:57.140 --> 18:58.140]  Check them out.
[18:58.140 --> 18:59.860]  They are on my website, ieregenetics.com.
[18:59.860 --> 19:01.900]  There's a link, a list of vendors.
[19:01.900 --> 19:03.780]  You'll find Superior Seeds there.
[19:03.780 --> 19:05.780]  Big up to our friends at Superior Seed Company.
[19:05.780 --> 19:06.780]  Support them.
[19:06.780 --> 19:07.780]  Help them out.
[19:07.780 --> 19:08.780]  All right.
[19:08.780 --> 19:11.020]  Also, patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[19:11.020 --> 19:15.900]  I think that is all my stone rambling ass brought for you for this episode.
[19:15.900 --> 19:17.820]  Thanks again for hanging out for a short episode.
[19:17.820 --> 19:20.060]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[19:20.460 --> 19:22.820]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy, Kurt Z.
[19:22.820 --> 19:26.540]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
