[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Alright, what's up podcast world?
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.040]  It is time for episode 480 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.040 --> 00:10.120]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.120 --> 00:15.320]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:15.320 --> 00:22.380]  Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.380 --> 00:26.080]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.080 --> 00:31.840]  Today I've been taking dabs of Curacao Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:31.840 --> 00:34.840]  This is a blend of coin style and Tahitian punch.
[00:34.840 --> 00:39.560]  On the package, they describe the flavor as vanilla and fruit chew and I'm going to say
[00:39.560 --> 00:41.000]  that is completely accurate.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.760]  When you crack open the jar, you get a sweet smell at first.
[00:43.760 --> 00:45.640]  I'm giving it a sniff right now.
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.520]  There's sort of some sweetness that hits you, almost like a cheesecake, almost like a pastry
[00:49.520 --> 00:50.600]  of some sort.
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.360]  But then right after that, you are overwhelmed with a fruit punch, maybe a Hawaiian punch
[00:55.360 --> 00:58.200]  or fruity Kool-Aid sort of aroma.
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.800]  I'm giving it another smell because I can't get enough.
[01:00.800 --> 01:05.960]  Then when you dab it, the first thing I notice when I dab it is a vanilla frosting flavor.
[01:05.960 --> 01:08.840]  Hits my tongue and coats my tongue very nicely.
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.560]  Then on the exhale, that fruit punch flavor kind of goes over my tongue and lingers and
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.000]  the buzz is perfect.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.280]  It makes me kind of chilled out.
[01:16.280 --> 01:17.280]  It makes me mellow.
[01:17.280 --> 01:19.240]  It makes my body feel nice and relaxed.
[01:19.240 --> 01:22.240]  It makes me want to sit in a chair and be nice and lazy.
[01:22.240 --> 01:26.400]  So I'm really enjoying the Curacao Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:26.400 --> 01:33.040]  It's got a very unique aroma, a very delicious flavor, and I absolutely approve of the buzz
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.560]  on the back of the package.
[01:34.560 --> 01:42.280]  It says that this product contains 69.37% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.360]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious concentrates.
[01:47.360 --> 01:50.880]  All right, podcast world, this is going to be a quick Thursday episode.
[01:50.920 --> 01:53.200]  I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.800]  Before we get to the emails, I'd like to do some shout outs to some folks who support
[01:56.800 --> 01:59.480]  the show on Patreon.
[01:59.480 --> 02:02.560]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[02:02.560 --> 02:04.000]  to our friend Todd K.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.800]  How about a Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you, a shout out, and a fist bump to
[02:07.800 --> 02:09.320]  my friend Glenn G.
[02:09.320 --> 02:11.780]  How about a big thank you shout out to James Brown.
[02:11.780 --> 02:14.240]  Of course, I always want to send a thank you to Tommy.
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.400]  Of course, a giant high five, a Grow From Your Heart hug, a podcast shout out, and a
[02:18.600 --> 02:20.880]  thank you to our friend Stabby McStabwood.
[02:20.880 --> 02:24.240]  Of course, I always want to send a giant shout out to our buddy Dick Goals.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.720]  Of course, another podcast shout out and thank you to our friend Meredith.
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.200]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.320]  shout out and a thank you to our friend Just Baz.
[02:36.320 --> 02:39.840]  Big thanks to each and every one of you for supporting the show on Patreon.
[02:39.840 --> 02:46.840]  And if you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.760]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.920]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.400]  I've got one more quick thing I want to talk about before we start reading emails.
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.080]  I want to send another special thank you to everybody who is listening to the show and
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.080]  who supports the show.
[03:03.080 --> 03:07.320]  No matter what service or what provider you are listening or watching on, thank you.
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.680]  I do appreciate it.
[03:08.680 --> 03:12.680]  I have noticed a giant increase in YouTube video views.
[03:12.680 --> 03:14.800]  A lot more people are watching on YouTube.
[03:14.800 --> 03:16.320]  So big thank you there.
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.880]  I have also noticed a giant increase in listeners on the Stitcher radio application.
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.760]  So big thank you to everybody who is listening on Stitcher.
[03:25.760 --> 03:32.400]  This month on Stitcher, we are currently ranked number 45 in the lifestyle and health category.
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.920]  So to be in the top 100 of any category on Stitcher is a great honor, but I am at number
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.760]  45 in my category at this current time on Stitcher radio.
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.520]  So big thank you to everybody who is listening and supporting the show.
[03:45.720 --> 03:47.480]  It is kind of amazing.
[03:47.480 --> 03:48.480]  It's overwhelming.
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.080]  And I guess it's a sense of pride that it puts in me to know that this little show that
[03:52.080 --> 03:58.400]  I produce here at my dining room table has become ranked number 45 in the top 100 in
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.480]  my category.
[03:59.480 --> 04:00.600]  That means a lot to me.
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.600]  Thank you for listening.
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.200]  Without you guys, it's just some weirdo with a microphone and way too many toys.
[04:05.200 --> 04:07.480]  So without you guys, this show wouldn't happen.
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.480]  So thank you.
[04:08.480 --> 04:09.480]  I appreciate it.
[04:09.480 --> 04:10.480]  Thank you for all the support.
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.360]  Thank you for all of the words of encouragement, the emails, the tweets, the Facebook messages,
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.760]  the Patreon support, all the high fives, all the hugs, all the love, all the respect
[04:19.760 --> 04:20.760]  and support.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.880]  It does not go unnoticed.
[04:21.880 --> 04:23.480]  So big thank you to everybody.
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.960]  All right, now let's move forward and read some emails from some of our loyal listeners.
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.760]  If you would like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.400]  You know that I would love to hear from you.
[04:35.400 --> 04:39.560]  The first email on today's episode goes just like this.
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.120]  It says, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.320]  I was listening to a podcast where you named some grow books.
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.840]  Do you have any books for new growers that are not just about breeding?
[04:48.840 --> 04:51.800]  The books you mentioned were mostly breeding books.
[04:51.800 --> 04:53.160]  I do appreciate your help.
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.440]  And then they signed their name.
[04:54.440 --> 04:58.520]  I'm not sure if they want their name said, but big shout out to our new friend, Kay.
[04:58.520 --> 05:01.840]  Let's talk about some cannabis growing books.
[05:01.840 --> 05:07.000]  I always encourage people to read, grow books, read books from reputable authors who have
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.440]  done this before.
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.060]  That way you've got that book there for reference.
[05:11.060 --> 05:13.160]  Maybe one day there won't be the internet.
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.960]  Maybe one day there won't be a bunch of podcasts to listen to.
[05:15.960 --> 05:19.680]  Maybe one day you won't have Google, but if you've got books on a shelf, you can always
[05:19.680 --> 05:20.680]  open them up.
[05:20.680 --> 05:23.760]  You can look in them and that information will always be there.
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.460]  I also feel there's something special about bonding with a book.
[05:27.460 --> 05:31.320]  The feeling of opening the book and finding the information you need and reading it off
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.620]  of paper and putting it into your brain and storing it that way seems to be more effective
[05:35.620 --> 05:38.120]  than just Googling some shit and reading it once.
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.680]  I feel like when you Google it, you read it, you forget it, it's gone.
[05:41.680 --> 05:44.240]  If it comes off the screen, it doesn't stay in your head as much.
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.000]  If you read a book and absorb a book, it really sticks in you.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.360]  So I think books are really good for you.
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.720]  I am not a grow wizard.
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.960]  I am not some grow Jedi.
[05:52.960 --> 05:54.840]  I have read a lot of books.
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.640]  So books are really good for you.
[05:56.640 --> 06:00.760]  Now let's talk about some of the grow books that I would suggest and recommend.
[06:00.760 --> 06:05.280]  There are a few authors that I would recommend almost any book they have written.
[06:05.280 --> 06:09.520]  Anything and Everything by Greg Green will be beneficial for you.
[06:09.520 --> 06:12.680]  Greg Green has written a book called The Grow Bible.
[06:12.680 --> 06:18.920]  Many grow authors have written The Grow Bible, but ones I can recommend come from Greg Green.
[06:18.920 --> 06:22.280]  Greg Green has written a very wonderful Grow Bible.
[06:22.280 --> 06:25.880]  Read anything and everything from Greg Green.
[06:25.880 --> 06:28.240]  Also I recommend Mel Frank.
[06:28.240 --> 06:30.920]  Read everything from Mel Frank.
[06:30.920 --> 06:35.440]  Now I'm going to talk about two very popular cannabis authors.
[06:35.440 --> 06:39.880]  These people talk about cannabis cultivation in depth and they've been around for quite
[06:39.880 --> 06:40.880]  a while.
[06:40.880 --> 06:46.720]  Some of the information that is in their books may seem a little bit outdated, but the basics
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.000]  always work.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.720]  When things start getting complicated, the first thing I tell a grower to do is go back
[06:51.720 --> 06:54.400]  to the basics and find out where you made your mistake.
[06:54.400 --> 06:59.360]  So if you want to learn from the very beginning and you want a very good cannabis foundation,
[06:59.360 --> 07:02.720]  I will recommend books from Ed Rosenthal.
[07:02.720 --> 07:07.720]  Ed Rosenthal published a book called The Marijuana Grower's Handbook.
[07:07.720 --> 07:13.000]  That is a great book for new growers, for experienced growers, and advanced growers.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.120]  Everybody will learn something from that book.
[07:16.120 --> 07:19.480]  People are going to argue with me and say that Ed is old school, that a lot of Ed's
[07:19.480 --> 07:21.960]  methods and techniques are outdated.
[07:21.960 --> 07:24.520]  That may be so, but that old shit works.
[07:24.520 --> 07:27.860]  And if you're just learning how to grow, you need a foundation.
[07:27.860 --> 07:31.960]  You need to be able to walk before you can run, and Ed will get you walking.
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.320]  Ed will get you running.
[07:33.320 --> 07:38.180]  So Ed Rosenthal, Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's Handbook is a great book.
[07:38.180 --> 07:40.600]  He also recently put out a Harvest book.
[07:40.600 --> 07:42.200]  That is a great book.
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.320]  The other grow author I want to talk about is Jorge Cervantes.
[07:46.320 --> 07:50.800]  Many people, along with that Ed Rosenthal category, will say that Jorge is outdated.
[07:50.800 --> 07:55.700]  I think he has a lot of great knowledge to offer, especially to a new grower who needs
[07:55.700 --> 07:57.600]  a solid foundation.
[07:57.600 --> 08:02.000]  So I will suggest a book from Jorge Cervantes called Marijuana Horticulture.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.200]  That is a great book.
[08:03.200 --> 08:06.420]  He also offers several other books.
[08:06.420 --> 08:09.080]  Read all of the stuff from Jorge Cervantes.
[08:09.080 --> 08:11.520]  Read all of the stuff from Ed Rosenthal.
[08:11.520 --> 08:13.500]  Read all of Greg Green's books.
[08:13.500 --> 08:15.640]  Read all of Mel Frank's books.
[08:15.640 --> 08:18.680]  Then I will recommend that you read books from The Rev.
[08:18.680 --> 08:21.680]  The Rev wrote a book called True Living Organics.
[08:21.680 --> 08:22.920]  That is a great book.
[08:22.920 --> 08:24.400]  Give that one a read.
[08:24.400 --> 08:29.240]  DJ Short wrote a book called Cultivating Exceptional Cannabis.
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.720]  DJ Short is a great breeder.
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.560]  He is a great grower, and his book is filled with knowledge.
[08:34.560 --> 08:36.920]  The Breeder Soma has also put out a book.
[08:36.920 --> 08:39.400]  That is a great book with great knowledge.
[08:39.400 --> 08:46.080]  There is also another author by the name of Drew West who writes great cannabis books.
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.520]  So we've got Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Mel Frank, The Rev, DJ Short,
[08:53.640 --> 09:00.840]  Drew West, and Soma are all great authors that can teach you a lot about cannabis cultivation.
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.800]  You should be able to find most of those books on Amazon or wherever you are purchasing your
[09:05.800 --> 09:12.760]  books, and if you do enough Google searching, you should be able to find many of those books
[09:12.760 --> 09:16.040]  in a PDF format for free.
[09:16.040 --> 09:19.320]  You'll be able to download them and have them right there in your computer.
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.360]  Like I said earlier, I like to have the actual book.
[09:22.400 --> 09:23.640]  I like the handheld book.
[09:23.640 --> 09:26.880]  I've got a bookshelf filled with grow books.
[09:26.880 --> 09:28.600]  I just think it's a great resource.
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.160]  You can grab that book and go sit down and just read a couple of chapters.
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.920]  I feel like if I've got my computer in front of me and I'm reading a couple of chapters,
[09:35.920 --> 09:37.440]  I end up on social media.
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.920]  So close the computer, get out a book, and learn some shit.
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.200]  Now, while we are talking about books and cannabis, there is another book I must recommend.
[09:46.200 --> 09:51.680]  We all need to read The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herr.
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.520]  So make some time to fit that book into the rotation no matter what you do.
[09:56.520 --> 09:57.680]  It's an important book.
[09:57.680 --> 10:01.120]  It'll be good for your mind, and you just need to read that if you want to be on Team
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.120]  Cannabis.
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.560]  Now, once you have read all of your books, there are great ways to supplement your cannabis
[10:07.560 --> 10:09.080]  education.
[10:09.080 --> 10:14.520]  Do not ever overlook the education we can get from podcasts.
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.680]  Podcasts are free, and many of them are loaded with great information.
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.000]  What I really like about a podcast is that I can learn something while I'm driving to
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.080]  another location.
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.440]  I can learn stuff while I'm in the shower.
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.600]  I've got an earbud in my left ear while I'm watering my own garden, so I'm learning about
[10:31.600 --> 10:34.280]  growing cannabis while I'm growing cannabis.
[10:34.280 --> 10:38.320]  So I really enjoy the education that I get from podcasts.
[10:38.320 --> 10:40.600]  I will recommend a few podcasts to you.
[10:40.600 --> 10:44.040]  Of course, I have to recommend The Dude Grows Show.
[10:44.040 --> 10:46.040]  Big shout out to my friend Scotty Real.
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.720]  Big shout out to The Dude, and we cannot forget Guru and the rest of The Dude Grows
[10:49.720 --> 10:53.920]  crew up there in Fort Collins and spread out across the nation, across the world at this
[10:53.920 --> 10:54.920]  point.
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.380]  So make sure you listen to The Dude Grows Show.
[10:57.380 --> 11:01.560]  That is available anywhere fine podcasts are available.
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.180]  We've also got Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences by Tad Hussey.
[11:06.180 --> 11:07.940]  That is a great podcast.
[11:07.940 --> 11:14.000]  I feel like Tad Hussey has a lot to offer for an advanced cannabis cultivator.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.800]  Another great podcast I should recommend is Shaping Fire with Shango Lowe's.
[11:18.800 --> 11:23.720]  That is a really great podcast, and you will have an opportunity to learn a wealth of information
[11:23.720 --> 11:25.360]  from that show.
[11:25.360 --> 11:29.960]  There are tons of other podcasts out there, but once you start downloading one or two
[11:29.960 --> 11:35.400]  of these podcasts, iTunes or whatever service you're listening on will recommend more cannabis
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.400]  related podcasts to you, and you will find the show that fits your needs.
[11:40.400 --> 11:43.760]  Sometimes you just simply don't like the host or you don't like someone's personality on
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.520]  the show.
[11:45.520 --> 11:46.520]  Maybe you don't like the flow of the show.
[11:46.520 --> 11:49.300]  You will find many shows that do fit for you.
[11:49.300 --> 11:51.920]  You also will find shows you simply cannot listen to.
[11:51.920 --> 11:57.040]  There are some podcasts that I'm sure would be great for me educational wise or maybe
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.920]  social wise, but I just can't handle the host or the tone of the show or something.
[12:00.920 --> 12:02.120]  So that is fine.
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.120]  Find a podcast that works for you and learn from that while you're in the car, while you're
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.740]  in the shower, throw an earbud in the ear and work in the garden and learn all day long.
[12:10.740 --> 12:13.720]  So don't overlook the possibility of learning from podcasts.
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.240]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[12:15.240 --> 12:18.920]  So I feel like that answered the question and then some, you asked for some books and
[12:18.920 --> 12:19.920]  some authors.
[12:19.920 --> 12:21.040]  I gave you a nice list of books.
[12:21.040 --> 12:23.260]  I gave you an extensive list of authors.
[12:23.260 --> 12:27.480]  Then I went as far as to recommend a few other podcasts that you can learn from.
[12:27.480 --> 12:31.480]  I want to thank you for the great email and if you ever have more questions, please reach
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.480]  out.
[12:32.480 --> 12:34.520]  All right, I'm going to move on to the next email.
[12:34.520 --> 12:36.720]  This one goes a lot like this.
[12:36.720 --> 12:39.080]  Hey man, big time listener.
[12:39.080 --> 12:44.640]  I was thinking of purchasing an RO filter today and today's podcast answered my question
[12:44.640 --> 12:47.280]  I had about using that to flush.
[12:47.280 --> 12:48.280]  So thank you.
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.240]  All right, so a few episodes back I had a question about flushing with RO water and
[12:52.240 --> 12:54.640]  it sounds like it answered this person's question.
[12:54.640 --> 12:56.640]  So it's good to know that I'm helping people out.
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.800]  It goes on to say, your podcast is inspiring and informative.
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.840]  I appreciate you sharing the wealth because it has helped me with working on my own crosses
[13:05.840 --> 13:08.680]  and making better choices in general.
[13:08.680 --> 13:10.640]  And that is a great statement.
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.640]  They say that the show is inspiring.
[13:12.640 --> 13:13.640]  That's awesome to hear.
[13:13.640 --> 13:15.280]  I like inspiring people.
[13:15.280 --> 13:16.560]  Informative is the goal.
[13:16.560 --> 13:18.480]  And I am here to share the wealth of knowledge.
[13:18.480 --> 13:21.600]  If I didn't share the knowledge, I feel like I would be ripping people off.
[13:21.600 --> 13:24.400]  That is a gift I was given, so I've got to put that out.
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.400]  And man, I'm glad that I have helped you work on your own crosses and it means a lot that
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.040]  I have helped you make better choices in general.
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.240]  That means you are setting yourself up for success.
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.760]  That means you're planning ahead.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.400]  That means that you have and should continue to have a successful garden.
[13:39.400 --> 13:40.440]  We'll keep going with the message.
[13:40.440 --> 13:44.880]  It says, I am in prohibition land, so I'm not going to wear glitter, but I'll definitely
[13:44.880 --> 13:46.740]  be celebrating as well.
[13:46.740 --> 13:50.520]  Keep up the good work and keep my name on the down low too, please.
[13:50.520 --> 13:51.520]  All right.
[13:51.520 --> 13:53.840]  So they don't want their name said, but they know who they are.
[13:53.840 --> 13:55.520]  So big thanks for the great email.
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.540]  Big thank you for the huge compliments and keep listening to the show.
[13:58.540 --> 14:01.360]  And it said you've made some of your own crosses.
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.160]  Send me some emails and let me know about the breeding that I've helped you do.
[14:05.160 --> 14:06.640]  I look forward to hearing about that.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.640]  All right.
[14:07.640 --> 14:09.520]  I've got another email right here in front of me.
[14:09.520 --> 14:11.040]  This one goes like this.
[14:11.040 --> 14:12.360]  Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.160]  I love your podcast.
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.720]  You and Jesse have fired me up for organics.
[14:16.720 --> 14:17.720]  Nice.
[14:17.720 --> 14:18.720]  That is good to hear.
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.720]  I love having Jesse come on.
[14:19.720 --> 14:21.480]  I love having Sean come over.
[14:21.480 --> 14:25.640]  I like having Frosty come over and we talk about organics and get people fired up about
[14:25.640 --> 14:28.200]  taking care of their garden organically.
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.120]  Those episodes also seem to inspire people to take better care of themselves.
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.280]  When we talk about feeding our plants organically and taking better care of our environment
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.600]  and being more sustainable, it seems to spark something inside of people where they want
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.920]  to do the same for their own bodies, which makes a lot of sense.
[14:44.920 --> 14:48.080]  Why wouldn't we take as good a care of ourselves as we do our gardens?
[14:48.080 --> 14:50.000]  We're trying to use our plants as medicine.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.640]  We should be taking top care of ourselves, but we often overlook that.
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.400]  So those organic episodes do get a lot of people inspired in a lot of ways.
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.040]  This message goes on to say, the soil is alive and we are working together along with the
[15:03.160 --> 15:04.160]  plant.
[15:04.160 --> 15:05.600]  Yes, we absolutely are.
[15:05.600 --> 15:10.520]  By us giving it the best life we can, the plant in turn helps us have the best life
[15:10.520 --> 15:11.920]  we can.
[15:11.920 --> 15:13.160]  That is absolutely accurate.
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.080]  I have talked in several episodes about how I feel the plant gives us back in tenfold.
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.640]  If you go in that grow room and you give that plant a little bit of love, it is going to
[15:20.640 --> 15:22.440]  give you back tenfold the love.
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.200]  If you've given it some care, some patience and pay attention to it, it is going to show
[15:26.200 --> 15:29.320]  you that ten times when it comes time to harvest.
[15:29.320 --> 15:34.400]  Also, if you ignore those plants and don't take care of them, they will show you tenfold
[15:34.400 --> 15:36.120]  when it comes time for harvest.
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.960]  So I definitely believe that these plants help us out karmically the same way that we
[15:40.960 --> 15:41.960]  help them.
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.720]  The message goes on, it says, big shout out to White Mike, much love and respect from
[15:46.720 --> 15:47.920]  your friend Tim.
[15:47.920 --> 15:49.960]  Hey Tim, thank you for the great message.
[15:49.960 --> 15:53.680]  Thank you for listening to the show and I'm glad that we have inspired you.
[15:53.680 --> 15:55.760]  I will pass the shout out to Jesse and Mike.
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.320]  I'm sure they are listening.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.320]  Shout out boys.
[15:58.320 --> 16:00.320]  It is time to get you guys on another podcast.
[16:00.320 --> 16:03.600]  All right Tim, I want to thank you again for the great message.
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.000]  The next message for this podcast goes just like this.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.680]  Hey Rasta Jeff, my second question is about pests also.
[16:11.680 --> 16:14.600]  So this comes from somebody who we have answered their question before.
[16:14.600 --> 16:19.240]  It says, now I've been fighting gnats all through this grow, but once I harvest, I would
[16:19.240 --> 16:22.680]  like to possibly reuse the soil as much as I can.
[16:22.680 --> 16:26.080]  I was wondering what you thought about this idea.
[16:26.080 --> 16:29.840]  Now this would only work in the middle of summer more than likely, but to seal your
[16:29.840 --> 16:35.480]  soil in a black garbage bag and let it sit out in the heat for six to eight hours, surely
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.440]  it would hit over a hundred degrees in the bag.
[16:38.440 --> 16:43.440]  I'm wondering if that way, if it would kill whatever may have going on.
[16:43.440 --> 16:48.080]  I was talking to a guy that gets rid of bed bugs and he says he heats the house to like
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.680]  106 degrees, which pretty much kills anything.
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.040]  I'm wondering how you feel about this ghetto, do it yourself idea.
[16:56.280 --> 17:01.800]  I'm actually driving around with a 50 pound bag of ocean forest in my car just for this
[17:01.800 --> 17:02.800]  reason.
[17:02.800 --> 17:03.800]  Don't laugh.
[17:03.800 --> 17:04.800]  Then they sign their name.
[17:04.800 --> 17:06.400]  I'm not sure if they want their name said on the show.
[17:06.400 --> 17:07.400]  They know who they are.
[17:07.400 --> 17:09.040]  Big thank you for the great message.
[17:09.040 --> 17:14.320]  So this person is asking about recycling soil that had fungus gnats.
[17:14.320 --> 17:16.220]  They had fungus gnats in their grow.
[17:16.220 --> 17:20.280]  Once they harvest, they would like to recycle the soil, but they are smart and they are
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.000]  concerned about getting these fungus gnats back in the grow.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.800]  Recycling soil and soilless mix and cocoa are very common practices.
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.780]  It is very cost effective and it also saves the big question of what do I do with all
[17:33.780 --> 17:36.160]  of this soil or soilless mix?
[17:36.160 --> 17:40.640]  Imagine if you grew six, seven gallon pots, you've got a whole bunch of leftover soilless
[17:40.640 --> 17:42.040]  mix at the end of the grow.
[17:42.040 --> 17:43.040]  What are you going to do with that?
[17:43.040 --> 17:46.360]  Are you going to put it in a trash bag and put it out by the curb for the trash guy to
[17:46.360 --> 17:47.360]  pick up?
[17:47.360 --> 17:48.360]  You're going to sprinkle it out through the backyard.
[17:48.360 --> 17:50.220]  Do you have somebody else that needs it?
[17:50.220 --> 17:54.980]  Not everybody has a big farm or a backyard where they can dump their old soil or soilless
[17:54.980 --> 17:55.980]  mix.
[17:55.980 --> 17:59.220]  So this person wants to figure out a way to recycle it.
[17:59.220 --> 18:02.060]  In most cases, that would be a very easy situation.
[18:02.060 --> 18:05.620]  You mainly just rinse it so you don't have a bunch of leftover nutrients from the previous
[18:05.620 --> 18:06.620]  grow.
[18:06.620 --> 18:08.820]  Maybe run some enzymes through there to help clean it out.
[18:08.820 --> 18:12.240]  Run your fingers through it, get all the big shit out, and then you can basically recycle
[18:12.240 --> 18:15.060]  that soil or soilless mix or cocoa.
[18:15.060 --> 18:21.080]  In this situation, we had a small bug infestation, so we are curious if we can get rid of those
[18:21.080 --> 18:22.080]  bugs.
[18:22.080 --> 18:27.940]  Now, something like a fungus gnat, I would feel confident that that 106, 120 degree range
[18:27.940 --> 18:29.660]  would get rid of the fungus gnats.
[18:29.660 --> 18:34.620]  However, I believe there are probably insects that would survive that treatment.
[18:34.620 --> 18:39.980]  There are probably insects or eggs that would outlast that heat blast treatment.
[18:39.980 --> 18:42.440]  I am not the insect expert.
[18:42.440 --> 18:47.240]  But I have treated rooms with chemicals and heat and just about anything I could throw
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.400]  at them, and I have had spider mites return.
[18:50.400 --> 18:54.440]  I am assuming that those spider mites were there from the dormant eggs that I did not
[18:54.440 --> 18:56.360]  destroy during my cleaning.
[18:56.360 --> 19:01.720]  So I am not certain that 106 to 120 degrees would get rid of every pest.
[19:01.720 --> 19:04.440]  I feel confident that it would get rid of your fungus gnats.
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.320]  They aren't one of the most aggressive, one of the strongest pests that we battle.
[19:08.320 --> 19:10.800]  So I think that will work for your fungus gnats.
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.520]  However, I do not know that that would work for other pests.
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.080]  I don't want to give you confidence and false guidance.
[19:18.080 --> 19:23.960]  So as long as you are certain that the problem was only fungus gnats, this should work.
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.480]  But it says you're using 50 pounds of ocean forest soil.
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.460]  That's probably three bags of dirt.
[19:31.460 --> 19:37.440]  And three bags of ocean forest soil will cost you somewhere between $45 and $75, depending
[19:37.440 --> 19:41.120]  on your location and the taxes and possibly shipping.
[19:41.120 --> 19:48.360]  I think it would be safer to discard 50 pounds of soil and replace it if you are worried
[19:48.360 --> 19:50.120]  about a bug problem.
[19:50.120 --> 19:56.800]  If you do reuse that soil and it has got a pest, it is going to cost you more than $50
[19:56.800 --> 20:02.760]  to $75 worth of pain in the ass, worth of effort, worth of product, worth of struggle
[20:02.760 --> 20:06.720]  to get rid of those bugs you could have prevented in the first place.
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.960]  Set yourself up for success.
[20:08.960 --> 20:14.040]  So if you do insist on reusing this soil, verify that fungus gnats were the only pest
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.600]  in that soil.
[20:15.600 --> 20:21.120]  Then do your 106 to 120 degree trash bag in the sun method and make sure that you have
[20:21.120 --> 20:26.080]  killed every pest in that batch of dirt before you try to reuse it.
[20:26.080 --> 20:31.320]  Now if you are not 100% confident that fungus gnats were the only problem in that soil,
[20:31.320 --> 20:34.400]  I would discard the soil and start fresh.
[20:34.600 --> 20:38.000]  One thing I would do is make sure that you have got fungus gnats and make sure it's not
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.200]  a different pest.
[20:39.200 --> 20:42.600]  If you've got root aphids or if you've got fungus gnats, there are two different plans
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.480]  of attack, two different battles, two different strategies.
[20:45.480 --> 20:49.960]  So verify that your problem is fungus gnats and if that's a fungus gnat in there, your
[20:49.960 --> 20:51.280]  method should work.
[20:51.280 --> 20:54.240]  If it's a root aphid, we have to have a different strategy.
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.400]  All right, my friend, I'm not sure if you want your name said on the show, but big thank
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.960]  you and big shout out.
[20:59.960 --> 21:01.440]  Let me know how this works for you.
[21:01.440 --> 21:04.040]  Let me know if you're confident that those are fungus gnats.
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.520]  And then if you actually do this, let me know how this works out for you.
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.080]  Did this get rid of your problem?
[21:09.080 --> 21:11.120]  Was it actually the pest we thought it was?
[21:11.120 --> 21:12.120]  Let me know.
[21:12.120 --> 21:13.120]  Send me an update.
[21:13.120 --> 21:16.760]  All right, podcast world, I feel like that is enough emails for this episode.
[21:16.760 --> 21:19.240]  I'll be back Monday with brand new content.
[21:19.240 --> 21:23.000]  I am working on the full mix episode, so stay tuned for that.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.280]  I'm also working on a couple more strain reviews and some grow lessons, so stay tuned.
