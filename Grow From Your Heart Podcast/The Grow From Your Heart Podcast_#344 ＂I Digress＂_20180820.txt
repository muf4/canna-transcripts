[00:14.010 --> 00:16.410]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:16.410 --> 00:19.910]  It's time for episode 344 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:19.910 --> 00:23.610]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:23.610 --> 00:24.810]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:24.810 --> 00:26.010]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:26.010 --> 00:28.510]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dadder,
[00:28.510 --> 00:29.810]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:29.810 --> 00:31.110]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:31.110 --> 00:32.910]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:32.910 --> 00:35.510]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:35.510 --> 00:37.510]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:37.510 --> 00:39.910]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:39.910 --> 00:41.810]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you
[00:41.810 --> 00:44.110]  by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:44.110 --> 00:46.810]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:46.810 --> 00:49.110]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:49.110 --> 00:52.810]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:52.810 --> 00:55.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[00:55.710 --> 00:58.610]  roll up a fat spliff, put some fresh water in the ball,
[00:58.610 --> 01:00.410]  or start heating up that dab nail
[01:00.410 --> 01:02.210]  because it's time for a fresh episode
[01:02.210 --> 01:06.310]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:06.310 --> 01:07.410]  What's up, podcast world?
[01:07.410 --> 01:10.010]  Welcome to episode 344 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:10.010 --> 01:11.410]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:11.410 --> 01:12.610]  You know I like to start the show off
[01:12.610 --> 01:14.910]  by letting you know what I am smoking on today.
[01:14.910 --> 01:18.910]  I'm taking dabs of the Fatso Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[01:18.910 --> 01:21.410]  We've talked about the Fatso Nectar on the podcast before.
[01:21.410 --> 01:24.710]  It is a combination of GMO and Legend OG.
[01:24.710 --> 01:28.710]  It's described as dark roast coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[01:28.710 --> 01:31.610]  I think it's got maybe a dark beer sort of a flavor.
[01:31.610 --> 01:34.810]  On the inhale, it's definitely got the dark roast coffee.
[01:34.810 --> 01:37.110]  Then it's got the fuel on the exhale.
[01:37.110 --> 01:39.610]  It leaves a little bit of a creamy flavor,
[01:39.610 --> 01:41.310]  kind of a dark beer sort of a thing,
[01:41.310 --> 01:43.410]  and then that garlic breath kicks in.
[01:43.410 --> 01:45.710]  It's got garlic and cookies at the end.
[01:45.710 --> 01:46.810]  I really like it.
[01:46.810 --> 01:49.010]  It's got a great head high, a face high.
[01:49.010 --> 01:49.910]  It goes to the eyes.
[01:49.910 --> 01:50.710]  I really feel it.
[01:50.710 --> 01:53.310]  So the Fatso Nectar is what I'm dabbing today.
[01:53.310 --> 01:55.010]  Earlier, I was taking dabs
[01:55.010 --> 01:57.510]  of some Cherry Slider Full Spectrum Extract,
[01:57.510 --> 01:58.810]  also from Green Dot.
[01:58.810 --> 02:02.210]  It is a combo of Cherry Pie Kush and Joseph OG.
[02:02.210 --> 02:04.710]  The flavor on the label is described as cherry cola.
[02:04.710 --> 02:09.010]  I thought it tasted like a packet of cherry Kool-Aid
[02:09.110 --> 02:11.710]  or maybe grape Kool-Aid with no sugar.
[02:11.710 --> 02:13.610]  It's a little strong.
[02:13.610 --> 02:14.910]  It's powerful in the flavor.
[02:14.910 --> 02:15.710]  It really hits the tongue
[02:15.710 --> 02:17.310]  with that cherry candy kind of flavor,
[02:17.310 --> 02:19.410]  but there's no sweetness to it.
[02:19.410 --> 02:21.910]  But it didn't have the medical quality
[02:21.910 --> 02:23.210]  or the high I was looking for.
[02:23.210 --> 02:25.610]  So I followed that up with the Fatso Nectar,
[02:25.610 --> 02:28.010]  and it worked out to be a beautiful combo.
[02:28.010 --> 02:29.110]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[02:29.110 --> 02:31.310]  I hope you guys are taking dabs of something delicious.
[02:31.310 --> 02:33.210]  I hope you're smoking a blunt of something wonderful,
[02:33.210 --> 02:33.910]  if that's your thing.
[02:33.910 --> 02:35.610]  I hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[02:35.610 --> 02:37.410]  Maybe you've got the vaporizer going.
[02:37.410 --> 02:39.010]  Wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
[02:39.010 --> 02:43.410]  I hope you were getting heavily medicated with me today.
[02:43.410 --> 02:44.910]  All right, you guys, let's get into a podcast.
[02:44.910 --> 02:45.810]  I want to start the show off
[02:45.810 --> 02:49.210]  by reading a couple of iTunes customer reviews.
[02:49.210 --> 02:50.410]  I've got two fresh reviews
[02:50.410 --> 02:52.310]  since the last time I read them on the show.
[02:52.310 --> 02:54.810]  And if you'd like to leave an iTunes customer review,
[02:54.810 --> 02:56.010]  it's really easy.
[02:56.010 --> 02:58.010]  If you're using your iPad or your iPhone,
[02:58.010 --> 03:00.610]  simply go to the podcast, open up the podcast
[03:00.610 --> 03:02.410]  like you're going to play a fresh episode,
[03:02.410 --> 03:04.410]  click on the Available Episodes tab,
[03:04.410 --> 03:05.810]  and then scroll down,
[03:05.810 --> 03:07.610]  and eventually it will bring you a menu
[03:07.610 --> 03:10.610]  that shows the iTunes ratings and reviews.
[03:10.610 --> 03:11.410]  And there's a little tab.
[03:11.410 --> 03:13.210]  It simply says, Write a Review.
[03:13.210 --> 03:15.310]  Click on that and type in a review.
[03:15.310 --> 03:17.210]  Let me know what you think about the podcast,
[03:17.210 --> 03:20.610]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[03:20.610 --> 03:22.610]  While you're there, it gives you the option
[03:22.610 --> 03:24.210]  to give me an amount of stars.
[03:24.210 --> 03:26.610]  It's a one through five star rating.
[03:26.610 --> 03:28.910]  So far, everybody that has left a written review
[03:28.910 --> 03:30.610]  has given me five stars.
[03:30.610 --> 03:33.010]  I encourage you to give me the amount of stars
[03:33.010 --> 03:34.610]  which you feel I deserve.
[03:34.610 --> 03:38.210]  So I look forward to seeing your iTunes customer review,
[03:38.210 --> 03:40.810]  and I look forward to reading your review on the show.
[03:40.810 --> 03:42.710]  So let's get into some of these reviews.
[03:42.710 --> 03:45.910]  This one comes from somebody who calls themselves Ben Hote.
[03:45.910 --> 03:47.510]  I hope I said that correctly.
[03:47.510 --> 03:50.210]  This review was left on July 26th.
[03:50.210 --> 03:53.510]  The headline is, A Podcast That Leads by Example.
[03:53.510 --> 03:54.910]  Of course, he gave me five stars,
[03:54.910 --> 03:57.410]  and it says, If you're interested in the cannabis scene,
[03:57.410 --> 03:59.510]  this is the podcast for you.
[03:59.510 --> 04:01.410]  Rasta Jeff and Mike take a deep dive
[04:01.410 --> 04:03.410]  into multiple cannabis topics.
[04:03.410 --> 04:06.410]  Each episode is guaranteed to educate and entertain.
[04:06.410 --> 04:08.610]  I love Rasta Jeff's authentic excitement
[04:08.610 --> 04:10.310]  and passion for cannabis.
[04:10.310 --> 04:13.410]  Mike and Jeff help keep me up to date on the cannabis scene
[04:13.410 --> 04:16.010]  while helping normalize cannabis in my own life.
[04:16.010 --> 04:18.910]  They promote family, honesty, and much more.
[04:18.910 --> 04:20.410]  Respect from Callie.
[04:20.410 --> 04:21.510]  Hey, big up from California.
[04:21.510 --> 04:23.010]  Thank you for the great review.
[04:23.010 --> 04:25.010]  There's a couple things I want to touch on there.
[04:25.010 --> 04:26.610]  First of all, he said Jeff and Mike.
[04:26.610 --> 04:29.010]  Hey, thanks for acknowledging that Mike comes on the show.
[04:29.010 --> 04:30.410]  Mike's got two kids now,
[04:30.410 --> 04:32.010]  so it's hard to get him out of the house.
[04:32.010 --> 04:33.110]  Sometimes when he comes over,
[04:33.110 --> 04:34.410]  he's not in the mood to record.
[04:34.410 --> 04:36.010]  He just wants to chill out, take some dabs,
[04:36.010 --> 04:37.110]  and have a good time.
[04:37.110 --> 04:39.610]  So shout out to Mike for being on the show when he wants to
[04:39.610 --> 04:41.610]  and for putting his energy into that.
[04:41.610 --> 04:44.110]  And dude, thanks for acknowledging our deep dives
[04:44.110 --> 04:46.310]  into the topics, because I kind of do go deep.
[04:46.310 --> 04:49.410]  I want to, I usually focus one episode on a whole topic
[04:49.410 --> 04:50.910]  and try to get you educated on that,
[04:50.910 --> 04:51.710]  and then we move forward.
[04:51.710 --> 04:53.410]  I try not to cover too much in one show
[04:53.410 --> 04:55.310]  as for multiple topics.
[04:55.310 --> 04:56.710]  Try to get that one topic thorough.
[04:56.710 --> 04:57.710]  So I'm glad you noticed that.
[04:57.710 --> 04:58.710]  Thank you.
[04:58.710 --> 05:01.110]  And then he said guaranteed to educate and entertain.
[05:01.110 --> 05:02.310]  That's what I'm here for.
[05:02.310 --> 05:05.810]  I was not a good student in school because I was bored.
[05:05.810 --> 05:07.510]  If my teacher would have taken a minute
[05:07.510 --> 05:09.210]  to make that class entertaining,
[05:09.210 --> 05:10.710]  I would have learned so much more.
[05:10.710 --> 05:13.410]  So I feel like I keep your attention
[05:13.410 --> 05:16.210]  and keep educating you by staying entertaining.
[05:16.210 --> 05:17.410]  Throw in a couple of jokes here,
[05:17.410 --> 05:18.810]  say some silly shit occasionally,
[05:18.810 --> 05:20.210]  and that's just my personality anyway,
[05:20.210 --> 05:21.510]  so it works out well.
[05:21.510 --> 05:24.610]  So I think my learning style is probably similar
[05:24.610 --> 05:27.210]  to a lot of cannabis consumers.
[05:27.210 --> 05:28.610]  We have to have a joke here and there.
[05:28.610 --> 05:30.910]  We have to have some light to the heavy
[05:30.910 --> 05:31.910]  to make it enjoyable.
[05:31.910 --> 05:33.610]  So I try to throw that in there.
[05:33.610 --> 05:34.510]  So thanks for noticing that.
[05:34.510 --> 05:36.710]  And dude, thanks for noticing my authentic excitement
[05:36.710 --> 05:37.810]  and passion for cannabis.
[05:37.810 --> 05:39.010]  That is true.
[05:39.010 --> 05:39.910]  That will never go away.
[05:39.910 --> 05:40.810]  Thanks for noticing that.
[05:40.810 --> 05:43.510]  So and also we keep you up to date on the cannabis scene
[05:43.510 --> 05:45.510]  and help you normalize cannabis in your own life.
[05:45.510 --> 05:46.810]  That's very interesting.
[05:46.810 --> 05:48.210]  I'm glad that we keep you up to date.
[05:48.210 --> 05:49.810]  I kind of think that a lot of my listeners
[05:49.810 --> 05:52.510]  may live vicariously through Mike and myself
[05:52.510 --> 05:53.810]  and the other folks that come on the show.
[05:53.810 --> 05:55.910]  So that's why I try to give detailed descriptions
[05:55.910 --> 05:57.010]  about what I'm smoking
[05:57.010 --> 05:58.710]  and some of the weird things that I do.
[05:58.710 --> 05:59.710]  So thanks for noticing that, man.
[05:59.710 --> 06:00.510]  I appreciate that.
[06:00.510 --> 06:01.910]  And once again, shout out to Mike
[06:01.910 --> 06:04.810]  and normalizing cannabis in your own life.
[06:04.810 --> 06:06.610]  That's an interesting statement.
[06:06.610 --> 06:08.310]  I'm not sure how you mean that,
[06:08.310 --> 06:09.610]  but that is really interesting.
[06:09.610 --> 06:11.210]  I'd like to know more about that.
[06:11.210 --> 06:14.410]  Also, we said they promote family, honesty, and much more.
[06:14.410 --> 06:17.010]  Yes, it's all about telling the kids the truth
[06:17.010 --> 06:19.910]  about cannabis and doing what needs to be done correctly.
[06:19.910 --> 06:21.810]  So dude, thanks for the great review.
[06:21.810 --> 06:24.810]  And for the five stars, I really do appreciate that.
[06:24.810 --> 06:26.410]  If I can get the iPad to cooperate,
[06:26.410 --> 06:29.510]  we will move into the next iTunes customer review.
[06:29.510 --> 06:31.010]  It goes like this.
[06:31.010 --> 06:34.110]  This one is left by somebody whose name is I'm the dude.
[06:34.110 --> 06:35.710]  What's up, the dude?
[06:35.710 --> 06:36.710]  This was left on.
[06:36.710 --> 06:38.410]  And this is not my friend named the dude.
[06:38.410 --> 06:40.610]  I do have a very good friend known as Rob the dude.
[06:40.610 --> 06:42.110]  This is not from Rob the dude.
[06:42.110 --> 06:44.410]  But either way, shout out to Rob the dude.
[06:44.410 --> 06:46.610]  The headline says ramble on brother.
[06:46.610 --> 06:48.110]  It sounds like you do listen to the show
[06:48.110 --> 06:50.610]  because sometimes we get quite rambly here.
[06:50.610 --> 06:52.810]  Anyway, the customer review goes like this.
[06:52.810 --> 06:55.610]  Jeff, my man, I love the podcast and all of the pictures.
[06:55.610 --> 06:58.110]  I think they're referring to my Instagram pictures.
[06:58.110 --> 06:59.410]  If you want to follow me on Instagram,
[06:59.410 --> 07:01.110]  it's I re underscore genetics.
[07:01.110 --> 07:04.010]  I post a lot of wonderful cannabis photography.
[07:04.010 --> 07:06.210]  I just posted a picture of black cherry Kim
[07:06.210 --> 07:09.710]  that has gotten over 400 likes in about seven hours.
[07:09.710 --> 07:12.110]  So that's a quality photo there on Instagram.
[07:12.110 --> 07:15.610]  Anyway, the review goes, I'd love to get some shots myself.
[07:15.610 --> 07:17.510]  Dude, all you've got to do is grow your plants,
[07:17.510 --> 07:18.810]  take good care of them,
[07:18.810 --> 07:21.910]  get yourself a nice piece of material from that's just I know.
[07:21.910 --> 07:24.710]  I know we had a listener say I shouldn't shop at Hobby Lobby.
[07:24.810 --> 07:26.310]  If you've got a fabric store,
[07:26.310 --> 07:28.810]  maybe Karen's fabrics or whoever Suzanne fabric.
[07:28.810 --> 07:31.410]  I don't know who the lady with a fabric store in your town,
[07:31.410 --> 07:34.310]  but find her get a just a nice yard of fabric.
[07:34.310 --> 07:36.310]  Hang that up. Put a light right above it.
[07:36.310 --> 07:39.210]  Get a decent camera. I'm just using a Nikon d3200.
[07:39.210 --> 07:41.110]  I've learned the settings on it real well.
[07:41.110 --> 07:45.210]  I've learned where to put the lights put your plants in front of a couple of really colorful tapestries
[07:45.210 --> 07:47.910]  or backgrounds take some great shots and practice man.
[07:47.910 --> 07:49.510]  You'll get there. It's just practice.
[07:49.510 --> 07:52.010]  It's learning the lighting the angles
[07:52.010 --> 07:54.110]  and honestly the settings on your camera.
[07:54.110 --> 07:57.910]  Once you get the camera figured out you'll be taking great shots.
[07:57.910 --> 08:01.010]  He also says your show is incredibly informative and helpful.
[08:01.010 --> 08:02.510]  Hey, that's what we're here for man. Thank you.
[08:02.510 --> 08:03.810]  And then he says keep it up man.
[08:03.810 --> 08:07.010]  It's always cool to find a fellow musician as well.
[08:07.010 --> 08:10.510]  Stay iry and rock on then he signed his name Mike.
[08:10.510 --> 08:12.110]  Hey Mike, it sounds like we could be friends bro.
[08:12.110 --> 08:14.610]  Hang out take some dabs play some music.
[08:14.610 --> 08:16.710]  Anyway, thanks for the great five-star review
[08:16.710 --> 08:20.210]  and guaranteed I will ramble on and I will keep it up dude.
[08:20.210 --> 08:21.510]  Thanks again for listening to the show
[08:21.510 --> 08:27.210]  and thanks to both of you for the five-star iTunes customer review.
[08:27.210 --> 08:30.410]  And again you guys I'm looking at the tab right now.
[08:30.410 --> 08:33.010]  If you go to the grow from your heart podcast
[08:33.010 --> 08:36.110]  where it shows that you're all caught up on listening to episodes mind says I'm all caught up.
[08:36.110 --> 08:38.110]  I honestly don't listen. I just delete them
[08:38.110 --> 08:41.510]  but I've got to have the show in the queue so that I can see when the shows pop up
[08:41.510 --> 08:42.710]  and I can get the links to tweet them.
[08:42.710 --> 08:45.410]  But if you go where it says that you've listened everything
[08:45.410 --> 08:48.110]  and then you scroll up you will see ratings and reviews
[08:48.110 --> 08:50.110]  and you'll see that Todd is at the top here.
[08:50.110 --> 08:54.110]  He left a review four years ago and then right next to that.
[08:54.110 --> 08:56.710]  It says write a review you just click right on there
[08:56.710 --> 08:58.710]  and it brings up the little screen to write a review
[08:58.710 --> 09:00.610]  and at the top it gives you the amount of stars
[09:00.610 --> 09:03.010]  so you can right away click on five stars
[09:03.010 --> 09:06.210]  or however many you feel like I deserve type in a title for your review
[09:06.210 --> 09:08.910]  and then go ahead and leave your customer review right there
[09:08.910 --> 09:10.610]  then hit send and it will post
[09:10.610 --> 09:14.710]  and I will read it on a future episode.
[09:14.710 --> 09:18.610]  Now that I'm caught up on iTunes reviews, let's work on some emails
[09:18.610 --> 09:20.010]  and I want to knock out a bunch of emails
[09:20.010 --> 09:24.110]  because I do have a large block of grow lessons coming up.
[09:24.110 --> 09:25.410]  I know I keep talking about it.
[09:25.410 --> 09:28.210]  I'm trying to get a few other random topics covered
[09:28.210 --> 09:31.110]  get some emails out of the way get a few loose ends tied up
[09:31.110 --> 09:34.610]  and then we're going to really dive into a long block of lessons,
[09:34.610 --> 09:37.310]  but in the meantime, let's catch up on some emails.
[09:37.310 --> 09:38.210]  I've got a great message.
[09:38.210 --> 09:42.210]  This one was just at the top of my inbox and it goes like this.
[09:42.210 --> 09:43.710]  Hey Rasta Jeff.
[09:43.710 --> 09:44.810]  My name is Adam.
[09:44.810 --> 09:46.010]  You can say it on the show
[09:46.010 --> 09:48.510]  and I've been listening to the show for a little while now
[09:48.510 --> 09:51.010]  and just have to say you do an amazing job.
[09:51.010 --> 09:51.310]  Hey Adam.
[09:51.310 --> 09:52.110]  Thanks for listening, bro.
[09:52.110 --> 09:54.110]  I do appreciate that and thanks for the compliment.
[09:54.110 --> 09:57.810]  He goes on to say I'm going through my first growth cycle seems to be going well,
[09:57.810 --> 10:00.510]  but I listened to you talk about the humidity on the podcast
[10:00.510 --> 10:07.010]  and I was just wondering where you were testing your humidity from is it floor level plant level light level
[10:07.010 --> 10:08.910]  or above the lights.
[10:08.910 --> 10:13.510]  I'm getting low to mid 70s around the plants mid 60s above the lights.
[10:13.510 --> 10:17.510]  It's a 5 by 5 room with seven Girl Scout cookies plants inside
[10:17.510 --> 10:19.810]  and I'm using a 1000 watt LED light
[10:19.810 --> 10:23.510]  and I have an oscillating fan in the corner on low.
[10:23.510 --> 10:29.310]  Thanks for any help and will definitely take a dab and give my mom a hug for you.
[10:29.310 --> 10:31.010]  You're already on the right path my friend.
[10:31.010 --> 10:34.710]  So let's talk about the humidity in your grow environment.
[10:34.710 --> 10:38.810]  This is a really good question because you've probably got just a small hygrometer.
[10:38.810 --> 10:41.010]  It's got the temperature and the amount of humidity.
[10:41.010 --> 10:43.910]  It's probably there's several different versions of this device,
[10:43.910 --> 10:47.810]  but it's usually about the size of like a pack of playing cards like a deck of playing cards.
[10:47.810 --> 10:51.010]  Maybe the size of your iPhone it probably hangs somewhere in the room.
[10:51.010 --> 10:55.210]  It's got a little sensor on it that measures the temperature and humidity in there
[10:55.210 --> 10:59.810]  and it just hangs and it displays and he probably only measures just a small area
[10:59.810 --> 11:03.410]  and most people aren't thinking about how many readings that thing is taking
[11:03.410 --> 11:07.710]  and the amount of area that is measuring in so it's a really good idea that you brought that up.
[11:07.710 --> 11:10.210]  I bet a lot of people are thinking wow, I've never thought of this.
[11:10.210 --> 11:12.110]  So they're going to go move their hygrometer right now.
[11:12.110 --> 11:15.710]  They're going to go change it to canopy level or they're going to go put it at another area.
[11:15.710 --> 11:22.610]  Anyway, I would recommend mostly paying attention to about canopy level about the top of the canopy
[11:22.610 --> 11:26.410]  down is where you really mostly want to focus where the plants are is
[11:26.410 --> 11:28.710]  where you want to focus on the humidity level.
[11:28.710 --> 11:31.510]  It's going to vary throughout the room like you're saying,
[11:31.510 --> 11:36.810]  but it's most important about canopy level down in through the canopy of the plants.
[11:36.810 --> 11:40.110]  That's about where you want to focus on the proper humidity.
[11:40.110 --> 11:43.210]  Of course, it's going to be a little more humid down low
[11:43.210 --> 11:46.610]  because you're watering the pots and that's where all the water is starting.
[11:46.610 --> 11:51.210]  It's going to be drier up above the lights because the water is going to rise toward the light,
[11:51.210 --> 11:55.410]  but it's not going to go past I'm talking about the evaporation the condensation.
[11:55.410 --> 11:58.810]  It's not going to rise past the light because there's no heat point up there.
[11:58.810 --> 12:01.210]  You may get a little pocket of stale humidity up there,
[12:01.210 --> 12:06.710]  but it's not going to be as humid above the light as it will be near the plants and down low.
[12:06.810 --> 12:11.310]  So I would focus more on the humidity near the plants.
[12:11.310 --> 12:14.310]  That's where it matters most is right around the plant.
[12:14.310 --> 12:20.110]  So if probably from the top bud down to about 18 to 24 inches down
[12:20.110 --> 12:21.710]  through the whole section of the canopy,
[12:21.710 --> 12:28.310]  you probably got like a 4 by 4 or 5 by 5 area in which your plants are taking up square footage area.
[12:28.310 --> 12:31.110]  That's where I would mainly worry about it.
[12:31.110 --> 12:33.710]  Now I'm going to kind of shift gears.
[12:33.710 --> 12:37.010]  I would check the vapor pressure deficit of the entire room.
[12:37.010 --> 12:40.910]  I would move my equipment around and see what it is throughout the room
[12:40.910 --> 12:43.610]  because you may have a hot pocket in one room.
[12:43.610 --> 12:45.510]  You may have not that kind of hot pocket you guys.
[12:45.510 --> 12:47.910]  I know you're hungry and you're stoned but not that kind of hot pocket.
[12:47.910 --> 12:50.010]  You may have a hot pocket in one part of the room.
[12:50.010 --> 12:53.010]  You may have a humid pocket in one part of the room.
[12:53.010 --> 12:57.510]  You may want to move that hygrometer around that thermometer around you want to move it around the room
[12:57.510 --> 12:59.710]  and see what's actually going on in there.
[12:59.710 --> 13:02.410]  You may be clueless that you've got one corner.
[13:02.410 --> 13:05.310]  That's not getting any airflow and you've got a bunch of humidity back there
[13:05.310 --> 13:06.710]  and it's getting real hot back there,
[13:06.710 --> 13:08.810]  but the rest of the room seems just fine.
[13:08.810 --> 13:10.710]  So this is a great thing to bring up.
[13:10.710 --> 13:15.510]  Don't just leave that hygrometer and thermometer in one area move it around
[13:15.510 --> 13:17.910]  and try to get the whole room ideal
[13:17.910 --> 13:20.810]  and the way you're going to get the whole room ideal is by more airflow.
[13:20.810 --> 13:22.210]  If you've got it pretty good over here,
[13:22.210 --> 13:24.110]  and it's just a little bit off over here.
[13:24.110 --> 13:26.410]  You can probably balance it out by moving air.
[13:26.510 --> 13:29.810]  You may need to bring in more air or evacuate more air,
[13:29.810 --> 13:33.010]  but if you're doing pretty close over here,
[13:33.010 --> 13:36.210]  and you're just a little bit if it's just stale on this corner,
[13:36.210 --> 13:39.110]  just put airflow in that corner and get the air moving.
[13:39.110 --> 13:43.310]  So you quit building that humid pocket over there or you quit cooking hot pockets over there.
[13:43.310 --> 13:44.110]  Whatever is happening.
[13:44.110 --> 13:49.610]  So the humidity and temperature are good things to pay attention to in the room,
[13:49.610 --> 13:54.910]  but also that's going to add up to a vapor pressure deficit that you're going to have to pay attention to.
[13:54.910 --> 13:58.110]  That's a math equation that I covered on another episode.
[13:58.110 --> 14:00.610]  There are websites on vapor pressure deficit.
[14:00.610 --> 14:04.810]  If you're not familiar with that, that's something else to check into.
[14:04.810 --> 14:12.510]  Now something else I want to think about in this message is you're saying that you're getting low to mid 70s percent humidity around the plants
[14:12.510 --> 14:16.110]  and mid 60s above the lights.
[14:16.110 --> 14:17.410]  That makes sense to me.
[14:17.410 --> 14:23.610]  It's about 70% humidity right around the plants and 60% humidity up above the lights.
[14:23.610 --> 14:28.910]  Now I'm curious how long had it been since you watered when you took that measurement when you got that reading?
[14:28.910 --> 14:31.410]  Did you just water or is it time to water?
[14:31.410 --> 14:35.910]  Because if you just watered and you've got that 70 and 60 you might be okay,
[14:35.910 --> 14:41.310]  but if it's time to water and you're still that humid in there, you're going to run into problems.
[14:41.310 --> 14:43.710]  You're going to have a little bit too much humidity in there
[14:43.710 --> 14:47.210]  and you're going to want to bring that down before you get into late flower
[14:47.210 --> 14:50.910]  or you run the risk of powdery mildew of bud rot
[14:50.910 --> 14:55.110]  and also you're just going to slow down the overall growth of your plants.
[14:55.110 --> 15:04.710]  So it totally makes sense to me that you're getting two different measurements one by the floor probably three or four measurements one by the floor one by the pot level one at canopy level and one up by the lights.
[15:04.710 --> 15:06.910]  You're going to have different humidity levels there.
[15:06.910 --> 15:10.010]  You're going to have to use airflow techniques to balance that out.
[15:10.010 --> 15:17.010]  If you've got a grow tent or a small room, it shouldn't be too hard a couple of small fans will make that work for you.
[15:17.010 --> 15:19.610]  Also, you're going to have to lower that humidity.
[15:19.610 --> 15:23.810]  You either need to evacuate some of the stale air and get fresh air in there.
[15:23.810 --> 15:26.410]  You need to get a small dehumidifier in there.
[15:26.410 --> 15:32.110]  Some way you need to bring that humidity down maybe minimize the amount of water you are watering the plants.
[15:32.110 --> 15:33.310]  I don't know if that's an option.
[15:33.310 --> 15:39.410]  It's just something you can think about doing but you need to get that humidity down before you run into problems.
[15:39.410 --> 15:43.310]  As I look further into your email, I'm just sitting here reading it again as I'm talking.
[15:43.310 --> 15:47.110]  Do you have anything on top of the grow room sucking out stale air?
[15:47.110 --> 15:54.410]  It says you've got a 5x5 room, 7 Girl Scout cookies, plants, a 1000 watt LED and an oscillating fan in the corner on low.
[15:54.410 --> 15:56.510]  Is there anything sucking that humidity out?
[15:56.510 --> 16:00.110]  You may need a can fan up top evacuating old air.
[16:00.110 --> 16:02.610]  That's going to be my first recommendation.
[16:02.610 --> 16:05.710]  Now while your humidity is that high pay attention to your leaves.
[16:05.710 --> 16:12.110]  If those leaves start sweating, if you see moisture coming out of the leaves heavily, then you're getting too humid in there.
[16:12.110 --> 16:16.010]  If they're started getting dry and looking leathery, it's too humid in there.
[16:16.010 --> 16:22.810]  If you've got a spot where two leaves are overlapping and they start sticking together because it looks like they've been pasted together,
[16:22.810 --> 16:30.210]  moisture came out of the bottom of one leaf and stuck to the top of the other leaf and now those leaves have kind of pasted themselves together.
[16:30.210 --> 16:32.810]  That's because you've got too much humidity in there.
[16:32.810 --> 16:41.710]  So it's going to cause you problems and you need to get that reduced as soon as possible because if you get into flower that is going to cause you problems.
[16:41.810 --> 16:48.610]  And if you're growing Girl Scout cookies, man, you're already fighting an uphill battle because Girl Scout cookies is not the easiest strain to grow.
[16:48.610 --> 16:51.110]  But the best part about cookies is when you do it, right?
[16:51.110 --> 16:52.310]  It is phenomenal.
[16:52.310 --> 16:54.510]  It will sell it will move off the shelf.
[16:54.510 --> 17:01.510]  It will come right out of the bag into people's pipes and you will do just fine if you do it properly.
[17:01.510 --> 17:03.610]  So I hope I answered that question man.
[17:03.610 --> 17:05.710]  I want to take readings from the entire room.
[17:05.710 --> 17:13.110]  But if you can't get the whole room dialed in focus on the area where the plants are in a small 5 by 5 area.
[17:13.110 --> 17:18.010]  It shouldn't take a lot of effort to get the room dialed in just a couple of fans.
[17:18.010 --> 17:20.410]  Honestly, I keep talking about that evacuation fan.
[17:20.410 --> 17:22.710]  You need something to pull all their out of there.
[17:22.710 --> 17:28.210]  Once you start pulling that old air out, you will see much more performance from your plants.
[17:28.210 --> 17:29.010]  So good luck Adam.
[17:29.010 --> 17:30.010]  Let me know how that goes.
[17:30.010 --> 17:35.610]  And if you have any more questions, feel free to send me a backup email and you guys if you'd like to send me an email my email address.
[17:35.610 --> 17:39.010]  Is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[17:39.010 --> 17:40.110]  I would love to hear from you.
[17:40.110 --> 17:41.910]  So let's get right to the next message.
[17:41.910 --> 17:43.710]  This one says what's up Rasta Jeff.
[17:43.710 --> 17:46.010]  I enjoy your podcast thoroughly.
[17:46.010 --> 17:49.810]  You definitely display a bunch of knowledge and love to share it with the public.
[17:49.810 --> 17:50.310]  Absolutely.
[17:50.310 --> 17:51.210]  That's what I'm here for man.
[17:51.210 --> 17:52.210]  Thanks for the great compliment.
[17:52.210 --> 17:53.510]  Thanks for noticing.
[17:53.510 --> 17:55.410]  He says highly appreciated by many.
[17:55.410 --> 17:58.910]  I'm sure because I think that your inbox is insanely busy.
[17:58.910 --> 18:00.910]  I'll get to another question.
[18:01.010 --> 18:06.910]  Have you ever thought to reverse a male and then have it pollinated by another male?
[18:06.910 --> 18:08.910]  Yes, we've thought of that but I'm going to keep going with your email.
[18:08.910 --> 18:21.110]  He says for what reason maybe it will increase the chances of finding crazy keeper males and perhaps maybe for some reason increasing the potency of the females due to genetic gender limitations.
[18:21.110 --> 18:22.910]  I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.
[18:22.910 --> 18:23.410]  Hit me back.
[18:23.410 --> 18:29.710]  If you don't I'm looking forward to hearing more about the strains you've bred and don't say my name on your show, bro.
[18:29.710 --> 18:30.510]  Thanks.
[18:30.510 --> 18:33.510]  No dabs around here, but I can give my mom a hug for you.
[18:33.510 --> 18:37.410]  The next time I see her love peace and cannabis grease.
[18:37.410 --> 18:41.510]  I'm going to scroll this right quick and make sure that there's no opportunity for me to have said your name.
[18:41.510 --> 18:42.710]  I don't think you included your name.
[18:42.710 --> 18:44.710]  So I think we're doing all right.
[18:44.710 --> 18:44.910]  Cool.
[18:44.910 --> 18:45.710]  I did not say your name.
[18:45.710 --> 18:48.610]  Now, let's get into your message here.
[18:48.610 --> 18:56.810]  He asked if I have ever thought to reverse a male plant and have it pollinated by another male plant.
[18:56.810 --> 18:59.610]  Now, let's talk about what that means.
[18:59.610 --> 19:07.210]  Reversing a plant is when I treat a plant with a I'm using silver thiosulfate is what I'm spraying my plants with.
[19:07.210 --> 19:24.510]  I use dried components to make my own silver thiosulfate concentrate and then I dilute it to the proper ratio and then I apply that to a plant and that will create a reaction in the plant that will trigger a female plant to produce pollen.
[19:24.610 --> 19:32.410]  It will make pollen sacks and pollen and that female plant will produce pollen that does not have any male chromosomes.
[19:32.410 --> 19:38.810]  So we will use that pollen to put on another female plant and that is how we make feminized seeds.
[19:38.810 --> 19:41.410]  That's the short version the very short version of it.
[19:41.810 --> 19:55.110]  So this listener is asking have I ever thought to take a male plant and apply silver thiosulfate to a male plant to turn it into a girl so that I could do further experiments with that female plant.
[19:55.110 --> 19:58.910]  Now, the answer is I have done the reversal part.
[19:58.910 --> 20:13.410]  I have actually flipped a boy plant into a girl to give myself an idea of what that plant would look like as a breeding female to or if I made an F2 generation or if I use that male to breed to some of my female stock.
[20:13.410 --> 20:21.510]  It kind of gave me an idea of what its traits would be what its floral clusters would look like what type of aroma it would give what kind of trichomes it would give.
[20:21.510 --> 20:29.810]  It gives you a very good representation of what the offspring is going to look like and what it's going to bring to the table genetic wise in this new cross.
[20:29.810 --> 20:33.810]  So I get to see kind of an advanced look into the genetics of the plant.
[20:33.810 --> 20:38.110]  So I have done the reversal to turn a male into a female.
[20:38.110 --> 20:51.410]  Now once I got that far I did consider experimenting but I decided to reach out to a couple of peers and our friend Colin Gordon at the Ethos Collective has already done what you were talking about doing and what I was considering doing.
[20:51.410 --> 20:54.210]  Colin is a little bit ahead of me in the breeding game.
[20:54.210 --> 20:57.410]  I don't mind saying that Colin is more advanced than myself.
[20:57.410 --> 20:58.210]  He's done it more.
[20:58.210 --> 21:01.210]  He's got more space and he's got more testers.
[21:01.210 --> 21:04.510]  He's just a little bit surpassed me in the breeding game.
[21:04.510 --> 21:06.710]  I've got nothing but respect for the dude in his company.
[21:06.710 --> 21:09.810]  He's just been at it a little longer than me and I keep my stuff.
[21:09.810 --> 21:14.110]  I do everything myself and he's got kind of a team so just a different approach to stuff.
[21:14.110 --> 21:23.110]  Anyway, Colin took a male and he reversed it and then he played experiments with it by pollinating it with a regular male and by pollinating it with a reversed male.
[21:23.110 --> 21:29.510]  He played several experiments and he said that most of the progeny came out weak and undesirable.
[21:29.510 --> 21:40.110]  So I'm not sure if he was doing inbreeding or outbreeding or bat crossing or what he was trying to do with these wacky male-female combinations.
[21:40.110 --> 21:42.910]  And I don't know if he was applying feminized pollen.
[21:42.910 --> 21:48.210]  I don't know if he was applying pollen from the same male that had been reversed from the same cultivar.
[21:48.210 --> 21:53.510]  I'm not sure his combinations, but I trust Colin's judgment most of the time.
[21:53.510 --> 21:58.310]  But when it comes to cannabis, I trust Colin's judgment like 99.9% of the time.
[21:58.310 --> 22:03.110]  There are some other times I've questioned him, but when it comes to cannabis, I trust Colin's judgment.
[22:03.110 --> 22:11.010]  So he said that the offspring was undesirable and I don't want to produce more undesirable genetics and I don't want to waste time and space.
[22:11.010 --> 22:16.310]  So I am going to believe Colin that it wasn't something that would be worth my time and energy again.
[22:16.310 --> 22:22.510]  But I have done the first step and the reason I reversed that male was to see what it looks like as a female.
[22:22.510 --> 22:28.710]  I wanted to see what traits it would bring to a breeding project and that's a really good way to get a preview.
[22:28.710 --> 22:34.810]  So that's a really good question and I completely understand what you mean and I hope I answered your question appropriately.
[22:34.810 --> 22:39.410]  The email goes on to say, I'm looking forward to hearing more about the strains you've bred.
[22:39.410 --> 22:43.510]  That's good because I've got a Lemon Jeffrey planned to be coming up very soon.
[22:43.510 --> 22:46.710]  Lemon Jeffrey seeds have been re-released at the Helladank Seed Company.
[22:46.710 --> 22:50.710]  So I'm going to do a talk about that strain very soon.
[22:50.710 --> 22:53.310]  Don't say my name on the show. Dude, I don't think you said your name anywhere.
[22:53.310 --> 22:57.110]  It's not even in the from because it's just got your initials up there.
[22:57.110 --> 23:00.110]  So that's cool. Then you say thanks. No dabs around here,
[23:00.110 --> 23:06.210]  but I can give my mom a hug the next time I see her. Hey bro, it sounds like you have caught on to the routine.
[23:06.210 --> 23:09.010]  So thanks for the great email. Thanks for the great question.
[23:09.010 --> 23:10.910]  I'm sure that's sparking a lot of people's minds right now.
[23:10.910 --> 23:13.710]  People that aren't super familiar with cannabis and breeding,
[23:13.710 --> 23:15.610]  they're sitting in their cubicle or they're driving in their car.
[23:15.610 --> 23:18.410]  They're going what the fuck? That's pretty entertaining stuff to me.
[23:18.410 --> 23:23.610]  That's the stuff I like to experiment with reversing plants, advanced breeding techniques.
[23:23.610 --> 23:26.210]  That's the stuff I like to get into that I don't talk about a lot.
[23:26.210 --> 23:30.910]  But if you've got questions on that, send me the questions at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:30.910 --> 23:35.910]  I'd love to hear from you. Dude, thanks again for the great email and thanks for sparking my brain.
[23:35.910 --> 23:40.610]  I do appreciate it. You guys, let's get into another message.
[23:40.610 --> 23:46.910]  This message comes from somebody who calls themselves roasted and toasted 420 and it goes like this.
[23:46.910 --> 23:51.610]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, get roasted and toasted 420 here coming from deep in Prohibition Land.
[23:51.610 --> 23:55.210]  What's up out there in Prohibition Land? Be safe and be careful, please.
[23:55.210 --> 23:58.810]  Then he says, I've got a question for that pot friendly cop.
[23:58.810 --> 24:00.510]  So if you guys have been listening to the show for a while,
[24:00.510 --> 24:03.010]  you probably remember that several episodes back,
[24:03.010 --> 24:05.510]  I got an email from a cop and I read the email on the show
[24:05.510 --> 24:09.810]  and then he replied and I emailed or I did a email from a cop part two as an episode
[24:09.810 --> 24:12.710]  and he said he would be happy to answer questions.
[24:12.710 --> 24:17.910]  Honestly, I've had a lot of podcast content, so I haven't harassed him about answering questions,
[24:17.910 --> 24:20.310]  but one of our listeners here has a question.
[24:20.310 --> 24:23.810]  So I'm going to read this. I'll talk about it and give you my opinion
[24:23.810 --> 24:25.910]  and then hopefully our cop friend is listening
[24:25.910 --> 24:29.310]  or maybe another law enforcement professional is listening
[24:29.310 --> 24:31.210]  or a legal professional will hear us
[24:31.210 --> 24:34.310]  and they can reply to growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[24:34.310 --> 24:37.110]  and they can give us some guidance on your question.
[24:37.110 --> 24:39.610]  Anyway, the question goes like this.
[24:39.610 --> 24:42.010]  I've always heard that you can lock your glove box
[24:42.010 --> 24:44.610]  and if you get pulled over the cops can't search the glove box
[24:44.610 --> 24:47.010]  or trunk without a search warrant.
[24:47.010 --> 24:53.510]  I've always been unclear because if they have probable cause and such such as a dog,
[24:53.510 --> 24:54.910]  you know, I'm not certain on that rule.
[24:54.910 --> 24:57.710]  I've never put my anything in the glove box
[24:57.710 --> 25:00.810]  because that's where my license registration and proof of insurance are.
[25:00.810 --> 25:02.210]  I guess my license is in my pocket,
[25:02.210 --> 25:04.810]  but my registration and proof of insurance are in the glove box
[25:04.810 --> 25:07.210]  and I always figured if I tried to stash something in there,
[25:07.210 --> 25:10.110]  I'm going to get pulled over and that's the first place I'm going to reach.
[25:10.110 --> 25:12.110]  So I've never put stuff in there,
[25:12.110 --> 25:15.410]  but I know a lot of people who have this same mindset
[25:15.410 --> 25:18.610]  that if it's locked they cannot go in there.
[25:18.610 --> 25:23.210]  That sounds accurate from my little, trust me, I am not a lawyer.
[25:23.210 --> 25:25.110]  I don't even claim to play one on TV.
[25:25.110 --> 25:28.610]  I don't know shit about the law other than I've watched cops a lot
[25:28.610 --> 25:31.310]  and I've been pulled over a lot.
[25:31.310 --> 25:36.010]  From what I know, if that's locked, they technically cannot go in there.
[25:36.010 --> 25:38.010]  Also, they're cops.
[25:38.010 --> 25:41.410]  If they've got any probable cause, they can now search.
[25:41.410 --> 25:44.210]  If they say, well, I smell weed,
[25:44.210 --> 25:48.610]  now they can invent the odor of marijuana and they can go through your car
[25:48.610 --> 25:50.210]  and then they can ask you to unlock that
[25:50.210 --> 25:52.210]  and then I don't know what happens if you refuse.
[25:52.210 --> 25:52.810]  I really don't.
[25:52.810 --> 25:54.310]  Maybe if they've got probable cause,
[25:54.310 --> 25:57.410]  they can probably get a crowbar and break that fucker open if they want to.
[25:57.410 --> 25:59.110]  I really don't know the rule.
[25:59.210 --> 26:01.810]  The dog, if the dog hits on your car,
[26:01.810 --> 26:04.410]  they've got probable cause and they can go through your vehicle.
[26:04.410 --> 26:08.610]  So the dog is definitely the loophole there for law enforcement.
[26:08.610 --> 26:12.510]  And what I've noticed is if you've got like a quarter of weed
[26:12.510 --> 26:15.310]  and they say, hey bro, just give me your drugs before I call the dog
[26:15.310 --> 26:18.610]  because if I call the dog, I'm going to fuck you every way I can.
[26:18.610 --> 26:20.910]  If you got like a quarter or an eighth, maybe just give it to them
[26:20.910 --> 26:22.510]  because once they call the dog out,
[26:22.510 --> 26:25.310]  you're wasting a lot of fucking time and they're pissed.
[26:25.310 --> 26:28.310]  So sometimes it's better just if you got a couple of grams
[26:28.310 --> 26:29.510]  or maybe just throw it at them.
[26:29.510 --> 26:30.410]  I don't know what state you're in.
[26:30.410 --> 26:32.110]  I don't know who you are.
[26:32.110 --> 26:36.110]  I'm not sure your demographic.
[26:36.110 --> 26:37.410]  I'm not sure if that'll work for you,
[26:37.410 --> 26:40.510]  but it may be better than getting the fucking dog called
[26:40.510 --> 26:41.610]  and going through all that.
[26:41.610 --> 26:44.410]  Sometimes you just piss them off doing that stuff.
[26:44.410 --> 26:48.610]  Anyway, I don't know the bottom line here.
[26:48.610 --> 26:52.710]  If you lock, like I had a van that had a drawer underneath the passenger seat
[26:52.710 --> 26:54.110]  that you could put maps and shit in.
[26:54.110 --> 26:57.110]  That's where I kept all my paraphernalia and my smoke
[26:57.110 --> 26:59.310]  because that little drawer under the seat could lock.
[26:59.310 --> 27:01.610]  I didn't know the technicalities on that.
[27:01.610 --> 27:04.510]  I don't know if I got pulled over if they could say open that.
[27:04.510 --> 27:06.210]  They probably could because they would just say,
[27:06.210 --> 27:07.410]  well, you smell like marijuana.
[27:07.410 --> 27:08.510]  We think there's marijuana in there.
[27:08.510 --> 27:11.210]  Now that's probable cause and that's how it would work.
[27:11.210 --> 27:12.010]  I really don't know.
[27:12.010 --> 27:16.710]  Hopefully somebody out there will chime in and make me not sound so ignorant.
[27:16.710 --> 27:20.210]  So growfromyourheartathotmail.com is where you can chime in and update that.
[27:20.210 --> 27:23.710]  If I've got cannabis in my glove box and I get pulled over,
[27:23.810 --> 27:27.210]  can law enforcement require me to open my glove box?
[27:27.210 --> 27:28.410]  What's the situation there?
[27:28.410 --> 27:29.510]  Show me a couple of examples.
[27:29.510 --> 27:31.710]  Let me know how that's going to work.
[27:31.710 --> 27:34.310]  All right, so there is more to this email and it goes.
[27:34.310 --> 27:37.310]  I also want to thank you for reading my email on your Thursday show
[27:37.310 --> 27:42.210]  as well as some advice I took from your vapor pressure deficit podcast.
[27:42.210 --> 27:45.410]  I've been keeping my rooms at 68 to 72 degrees
[27:45.410 --> 27:47.310]  and after I heard your podcast while at work,
[27:47.310 --> 27:50.610]  I called my wife and asked her to adjust the air conditioner.
[27:50.610 --> 27:52.910]  After she adjusted, which was a week ago,
[27:52.910 --> 27:55.410]  I've seen my plants completely turn around
[27:55.410 --> 27:57.510]  and now they are looking super healthy,
[27:57.510 --> 28:03.010]  at least the best they can since this round I tried my hand at monster cropping.
[28:03.010 --> 28:07.010]  So this listener listened to the vapor pressure deficit episode
[28:07.010 --> 28:10.010]  and decided to make some adjustments based on my advice
[28:10.010 --> 28:13.310]  and his plants have completely turned around.
[28:13.310 --> 28:14.910]  So that's great news.
[28:14.910 --> 28:16.110]  Glad your plants are working out.
[28:16.110 --> 28:17.810]  I'm glad my advice worked for you
[28:17.810 --> 28:21.210]  and it means a lot to me that people have enough trust in me
[28:21.210 --> 28:24.710]  to go change their entire grow based on some stuff that I say,
[28:24.710 --> 28:26.810]  but it always feels good to get a message saying,
[28:26.810 --> 28:28.810]  hey dude, I did your stuff and it worked.
[28:28.810 --> 28:30.110]  So that feels good to me.
[28:30.110 --> 28:31.610]  I'm glad your plants are looking better, bro.
[28:31.610 --> 28:36.010]  I'm glad I was able to help you out and get you back on course.
[28:36.010 --> 28:38.210]  Then he goes on to say during the two-month veg cycle
[28:38.210 --> 28:39.810]  for the first week of flower,
[28:39.810 --> 28:42.410]  the leaves were mostly single leaf bud structure type
[28:42.410 --> 28:46.510]  and now while budding they have put on normal growth.
[28:46.510 --> 28:47.010]  That's great.
[28:47.010 --> 28:48.410]  That means that the hormones have all leveled out
[28:48.410 --> 28:50.110]  and everything's going the way that it should
[28:50.210 --> 28:52.010]  and he should have a decent crop
[28:52.010 --> 28:54.010]  and the reason his plants were acting funky you guys,
[28:54.010 --> 28:56.210]  I don't know if you caught that he said monster cropping.
[28:56.210 --> 28:59.310]  That is when you take a clone from plants
[28:59.310 --> 29:02.810]  that are a little bit into flower a little more than a week,
[29:02.810 --> 29:04.010]  maybe up to 14 days.
[29:04.010 --> 29:05.410]  I've seen him go a little later.
[29:05.410 --> 29:06.310]  I don't recommend it,
[29:06.310 --> 29:07.910]  but a lot of people are doing it
[29:07.910 --> 29:10.510]  and it seems to be working for our friend
[29:10.510 --> 29:14.510]  who is calling himself get roasted and toasted 420.
[29:14.510 --> 29:17.810]  So they in the email with thanks great 420
[29:17.810 --> 29:20.410]  and of course you can use my name PS.
[29:20.410 --> 29:22.110]  I really appreciate helping me out
[29:22.110 --> 29:24.310]  with my recent germination problem
[29:24.310 --> 29:29.210]  and I'm looking forward to getting roasted on that sweet dank.
[29:29.210 --> 29:31.010]  Hey, dude, I'm glad you're listening to the podcast.
[29:31.010 --> 29:34.710]  I'm glad with my help you were able to get your grow back up to speed
[29:34.710 --> 29:36.910]  and I'm glad everything is working out for you
[29:36.910 --> 29:41.010]  and I hope we get some answers on this glove box question,
[29:41.010 --> 29:42.510]  dude. Thanks for the great email.
[29:42.510 --> 29:44.710]  Once again, if somebody wants to send me an email,
[29:44.710 --> 29:48.010]  the email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[29:48.010 --> 29:51.010]  You know, I would love to hear from you.
[29:51.010 --> 29:52.210]  All right. I've got one more email.
[29:52.210 --> 29:53.010]  I'm going to read tonight.
[29:53.010 --> 29:56.510]  But before I do that, I want to give a couple of quick patreon shoutouts.
[29:56.510 --> 29:59.810]  I owe a huge shout out to John Bendit Adam K.
[29:59.810 --> 30:03.710]  I wish out to Tyler and a huge shout out to Brett Cormier.
[30:03.710 --> 30:04.710]  Thanks for the support you guys.
[30:04.710 --> 30:05.710]  I do appreciate it.
[30:05.710 --> 30:07.610]  Now, let's get back into these emails.
[30:07.610 --> 30:10.410]  This one says hey Rasta Jeff my name.
[30:10.410 --> 30:12.510]  I'm not sure if they want their name said my name is Justin.
[30:12.510 --> 30:15.110]  I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now
[30:15.110 --> 30:16.510]  and I am just about caught up.
[30:16.510 --> 30:16.810]  Hey man.
[30:16.810 --> 30:18.510]  Thanks for listening to all the old episodes.
[30:18.510 --> 30:21.710]  Have you gone to YouTube and listened all the way from episode one?
[30:21.710 --> 30:23.910]  That's quite embarrassing, but there's a lot of knowledge there.
[30:23.910 --> 30:25.410]  So go check that out.
[30:25.410 --> 30:28.610]  They continue to say I want to say thank you for the wealth of knowledge
[30:28.610 --> 30:31.210]  that you continue to bring to the table on a regular basis.
[30:31.210 --> 30:32.010]  Hey, you're very welcome.
[30:32.010 --> 30:35.410]  Thanks for acknowledging that I am a New York MMJ patient
[30:35.410 --> 30:37.310]  for about six months or so now.
[30:37.310 --> 30:40.810]  Unfortunately, we only have pills tinctures and vape pins,
[30:40.810 --> 30:45.310]  but I'm hopeful we will be able to grow and smoke our own flowers very soon.
[30:45.310 --> 30:46.210]  Hey, good luck with that man.
[30:46.210 --> 30:50.310]  That's kind of weird that the thing that works the quickest
[30:50.310 --> 30:53.310]  and most directly you aren't even allowed to use I guess it's great
[30:53.310 --> 30:56.510]  that you've got medical marijuana, but it's kind of weird without flowers.
[30:56.510 --> 30:59.310]  I think that's just law enforcement being afraid.
[30:59.310 --> 31:00.810]  Anyway, let's keep moving with the email.
[31:00.810 --> 31:04.510]  It says listening to you and white Mike on a regular basis has inspired me
[31:04.510 --> 31:09.010]  to join my local normal chapter and that's the n-o-r-m-l chapter the
[31:09.110 --> 31:14.910]  National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws and try to push for reform.
[31:14.910 --> 31:21.510]  Anyways, I have been also moved to research as much about this glorious plant as possible.
[31:21.510 --> 31:25.510]  I have aspirations of being a grower and breeder when it becomes legal here
[31:25.510 --> 31:27.010]  after I got home from Iraq.
[31:27.010 --> 31:28.010]  I had trouble sleeping.
[31:28.010 --> 31:29.610]  So I turned to alcohol.
[31:29.610 --> 31:32.710]  I've heard that story too many times and also thanks for your service man,
[31:32.710 --> 31:37.010]  by the way, it became overly excessive causing me to lose multiple jobs.
[31:37.010 --> 31:38.910]  That's an all too familiar story.
[31:38.910 --> 31:42.410]  Thanks to my friends that introduced me to the plant a great friends.
[31:42.410 --> 31:46.910]  That's who you needed and finishing up my term of service as I no longer needed to take p-test.
[31:46.910 --> 31:50.510]  I was able to stop drinking completely along with other substances.
[31:50.510 --> 31:53.410]  I was abusing and I also quit smoking cigarettes.
[31:53.410 --> 31:57.910]  I truly think cannabis has saved my life.
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.910]  I would agree with you that cannabis has saved your life.
[31:59.910 --> 32:02.810]  I have several friends who have similar stories to this.
[32:02.810 --> 32:08.310]  I'm not sure if you've ever listened to the episode with Steve DeFino Steve DeFino is a veteran
[32:08.310 --> 32:12.310]  who's got a grapefruit size hole in his back.
[32:12.310 --> 32:15.810]  You could you could put a grapefruit in there and put a piece of duct tape over it
[32:15.810 --> 32:19.810]  and you could smuggle a grapefruit and on this man's body where he got blown up
[32:19.810 --> 32:20.710]  and I'm not making fun of the guy.
[32:20.710 --> 32:21.710]  I'm not being disrespectful.
[32:21.710 --> 32:25.910]  He would agree with you that you could smuggle a fucking grapefruit on this man's body.
[32:25.910 --> 32:29.610]  He takes it very well, but he takes it well for the same reason as you
[32:29.610 --> 32:34.810]  because he is able to consume cannabis to ease his PTSD symptoms,
[32:34.810 --> 32:37.710]  which is what was keeping you up at night.
[32:37.710 --> 32:41.410]  The feelings the thoughts the nightmares cannabis is helping him with that.
[32:41.410 --> 32:42.910]  It sounds like it's helping you with that.
[32:42.910 --> 32:45.310]  I'm sorry if I'm bringing anything back while I speak about this,
[32:45.310 --> 32:50.310]  but those are the things that cannabis will help you find relief from
[32:50.310 --> 32:56.010]  and it doesn't have the punishing effects on your body your social life your family life
[32:56.010 --> 33:00.710]  and your wallet as alcohol does alcohol has a lot of long-lasting problems
[33:00.710 --> 33:03.010]  and it says here that you were abusing other substances.
[33:03.010 --> 33:06.510]  So the alcohol was kind of your gateway drug into some other bullshit
[33:06.510 --> 33:09.610]  because once we get drunk we let down our our inhibitions our limits.
[33:09.610 --> 33:11.210]  We're like, I'm already hammered.
[33:11.210 --> 33:13.910]  Why not just do this other next level dumb shit.
[33:13.910 --> 33:15.610]  You're like I already did level two dumb shit.
[33:15.610 --> 33:18.010]  Let's level three it and it just starts going.
[33:18.010 --> 33:22.210]  So it sounds like having good friends.
[33:22.210 --> 33:26.610]  What's that supported you and also introduced you to cannabis really turned your life around.
[33:26.610 --> 33:28.710]  So man, thanks for joining the green team.
[33:28.710 --> 33:30.110]  Also, thanks for your service once again,
[33:30.110 --> 33:32.210]  because it sounds like you really put it in and it kind of messed you up.
[33:32.210 --> 33:33.610]  So thanks for that.
[33:33.610 --> 33:34.310]  Thanks for coming out.
[33:34.310 --> 33:36.310]  All right, and then thanks for being on team green with us.
[33:36.310 --> 33:39.710]  We do appreciate that then he says, but I digress which hey,
[33:39.710 --> 33:40.910]  that's just fine for this show.
[33:40.910 --> 33:43.210]  This is the ramble stoner podcast.
[33:43.210 --> 33:45.010]  We don't mind a little digress.
[33:45.010 --> 33:48.910]  He said I actually had two questions for you regarding information sources
[33:48.910 --> 33:51.110]  and your opinion on them.
[33:51.110 --> 33:55.610]  He said first I enrolled in a horticulture program at the local college,
[33:55.610 --> 34:00.110]  but I wanted some more specific some more industry-specific education.
[34:00.110 --> 34:03.410]  So I've also enrolled in cannabis training University.
[34:03.410 --> 34:07.810]  I was wondering if you've heard of it or if you can shed your opinion on their
[34:07.810 --> 34:10.410]  master of marijuana certificate.
[34:10.410 --> 34:12.610]  All right. I do have a couple things I can touch on there.
[34:12.610 --> 34:18.410]  I feel like the horticulture program at your local college is going to be more useful
[34:18.410 --> 34:21.810]  than your cannabis training University education.
[34:21.810 --> 34:25.010]  Cannabis is turning into a commercially produced crop.
[34:25.010 --> 34:27.110]  This is commercial horticulture.
[34:27.110 --> 34:31.510]  It is a higher commodity a higher value commercial horticulture product,
[34:31.510 --> 34:34.310]  but it is a horticultural product.
[34:34.310 --> 34:38.010]  I think taking a horticultural program is going to be key.
[34:38.010 --> 34:41.210]  I do find value in the cannabis training University
[34:41.210 --> 34:43.710]  because you're going to learn specific terms.
[34:43.710 --> 34:46.310]  Hopefully they're teaching you market stuff.
[34:46.310 --> 34:48.610]  Not just like not just grow things.
[34:48.610 --> 34:52.710]  Hopefully you're learning the dispensary side the terpenes the cannabinoids.
[34:52.710 --> 34:57.410]  Hopefully you're learning body interaction and stuff like that.
[34:57.410 --> 34:59.110]  Then you said I was wondering if you've heard of it
[34:59.110 --> 35:02.610]  or if you can shed opinion on their master of marijuana certificate.
[35:02.610 --> 35:06.910]  I'm not that sounds a lot like a master grower certificate.
[35:06.910 --> 35:09.510]  That looks really good on a resume,
[35:09.510 --> 35:19.010]  but in social circles here in the so Colorado kind of has a group of stuck up cannabis industry people
[35:19.010 --> 35:21.510]  growers breeders industry folks.
[35:21.510 --> 35:24.210]  There's a group of elitists.
[35:24.310 --> 35:31.310]  And they slash we kind of laugh a little bit at the term master grower.
[35:31.310 --> 35:33.110]  It's just I know it's just a label.
[35:33.110 --> 35:37.210]  It's what your paycheck says or it's what your job designation says,
[35:37.210 --> 35:40.910]  but the term master grower here is kind of laughed at that's kind of a douchey thing to say.
[35:40.910 --> 35:42.110]  It's a big egotistical thing.
[35:42.110 --> 35:44.410]  I'm the master grower over at this facility.
[35:44.410 --> 35:48.410]  It just sounds really funny to say don't say I'm the master grower,
[35:48.410 --> 35:50.210]  even if that's your title on your paycheck,
[35:50.210 --> 35:53.310]  even if that's your title in the company in which you work.
[35:53.310 --> 35:55.110]  Don't just don't just say lead cultivator.
[35:55.110 --> 35:57.710]  It sounds a lot better or grow manager.
[35:57.710 --> 36:00.710]  Anyway, I digress at this point.
[36:00.710 --> 36:04.010]  It looks really good on a resume and if you were learning
[36:04.010 --> 36:07.710]  and you can actually apply what you were learning it is great,
[36:07.710 --> 36:10.610]  but in social situations, it's a little bit awkward.
[36:10.610 --> 36:15.110]  So put that on a resume that will be helpful that will help you out.
[36:15.110 --> 36:18.910]  I don't know enough about their curriculum to know what they're teaching you.
[36:18.910 --> 36:20.610]  I don't know if they're teaching you how to grow.
[36:20.610 --> 36:22.910]  I don't know if they're teaching you how to clone.
[36:22.910 --> 36:25.210]  I don't know if they're teaching you the evolution of the market.
[36:25.210 --> 36:26.710]  I'm not sure what you're learning there.
[36:26.710 --> 36:29.810]  Hopefully it's a broad education and it's not just too focused.
[36:29.810 --> 36:34.010]  If it's grow stuff you learn more through just getting in a grow
[36:34.010 --> 36:38.010]  and doing it and by taking that horticultural program at the college,
[36:38.010 --> 36:40.910]  but it's going to look really good on a resume.
[36:40.910 --> 36:44.110]  If I were hiring that would say hey this guy took a little extra
[36:44.110 --> 36:46.510]  and probably already knows how to cut clones.
[36:46.510 --> 36:48.010]  So I don't have to teach him how to cut clones.
[36:48.010 --> 36:51.210]  He probably already knows what micro and macro nutrients are.
[36:51.310 --> 36:55.110]  He hopefully has a little bit of pesticide training that comes with that.
[36:55.110 --> 36:58.310]  I really don't know, but I would assume that you have a little advanced training.
[36:58.310 --> 37:00.110]  So it's going to look good on a resume.
[37:00.110 --> 37:03.910]  So that may come in handy, but as for the curriculum and what you've learned,
[37:03.910 --> 37:05.710]  I really don't know what they teach there.
[37:05.710 --> 37:08.010]  So I don't really have an opinion,
[37:08.010 --> 37:10.910]  but any education looks good on a resume when I'm hiring
[37:10.910 --> 37:14.010]  and I would ask you questions about it while we were in the interview room.
[37:14.010 --> 37:16.810]  So the second question says I want to become more knowledgeable
[37:16.810 --> 37:18.810]  on as many different strains as possible
[37:18.910 --> 37:22.710]  and I was wondering where you thought I should look for reliable info.
[37:22.710 --> 37:24.210]  Is Leafly a good source?
[37:24.210 --> 37:28.510]  And if not, any light you can shed would be great.
[37:28.510 --> 37:33.010]  Now Leafly is a decent source. Leafly is not the best source,
[37:33.010 --> 37:36.910]  but they have a lot of strains there and they do their research pretty well.
[37:36.910 --> 37:38.910]  They've actually got a couple of my strains up there
[37:38.910 --> 37:42.910]  and they pulled the descriptions from magazine articles
[37:42.910 --> 37:45.710]  and websites that featured my stuff and they got it accurate.
[37:45.710 --> 37:47.910]  I think what they put is mostly accurate.
[37:47.910 --> 37:50.710]  Mike Capelton is up there and Lemon Jeffery is up there
[37:50.710 --> 37:53.510]  and soon Arise should be listed up on Leafly.
[37:53.510 --> 37:56.810]  If you guys haven't gone and submitted Arise for a strain review on Leafly,
[37:56.810 --> 37:59.610]  please do that. I've done a whole episode on the Arise strain.
[37:59.610 --> 38:03.910]  I would appreciate the support there, but Leafly is not a bad source of information.
[38:03.910 --> 38:08.010]  I like what I do like about Leafly is that you can read customer reviews
[38:08.010 --> 38:12.010]  on how it treated people. If somebody bought Lemon Jeffery,
[38:12.010 --> 38:13.710]  you can see that people wrote,
[38:13.710 --> 38:16.810]  this is the best cannabis I've ever smoked and this relieved my anxiety
[38:16.810 --> 38:19.710]  and people list things. I like that.
[38:19.710 --> 38:24.210]  However, when things are crowdsourced, there's the opportunity for misinformation.
[38:24.210 --> 38:27.410]  So it's great on one hand. It could be a problem on the other.
[38:27.410 --> 38:29.710]  You sound like an intelligent person.
[38:29.710 --> 38:34.210]  The internet is a great tool for people who are smart enough to filter out the bullshit.
[38:34.210 --> 38:38.910]  So I would start at Leafly. Then I would venture out to other websites
[38:38.910 --> 38:45.510]  like seedfinder.eu. Seedfinder is a great website that lists most of the major brands
[38:45.610 --> 38:49.010]  and it's got like a family tree. If you want to learn about a strain,
[38:49.010 --> 38:53.010]  you type in, we're just going to say Lemon Jeffery because that's where my brain is.
[38:53.010 --> 38:57.210]  Type in Lemon Jeffery. It'll show you that Lemon Jeffery is a cross of Golden Goat
[38:57.210 --> 38:59.510]  and Lemon Skunk. Then on the same page,
[38:59.510 --> 39:04.310]  it's also going to show you that that Golden Goat is a cross of Hawaiian Sweet Skunk
[39:04.310 --> 39:07.510]  or Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa, and Romulan.
[39:07.510 --> 39:10.810]  Then right under that, it's going to show you that Lemon Skunk is a cross of this
[39:11.610 --> 39:16.210]  and then it's going to keep breaking it down for like 25 or 30 lines.
[39:16.210 --> 39:21.210]  So you can see the breakdown, the lineage way back and see how it was made.
[39:21.210 --> 39:27.110]  So I like seedfinder.eu for doing research on strains and finding what crosses are
[39:27.110 --> 39:29.710]  and finding the genetic lineage of things.
[39:29.710 --> 39:33.710]  Also, I like going to seed vending websites.
[39:33.710 --> 39:35.810]  Like if you wanted to buy some iReed Genetic Seeds
[39:35.810 --> 39:37.610]  or you wanted to know something about iReed Genetics,
[39:37.610 --> 39:39.510]  you could go to the Helladank Seed Company
[39:39.510 --> 39:41.910]  and just click on the strains that are available there
[39:41.910 --> 39:45.510]  and they should have pretty good descriptions because they want to sell that
[39:45.510 --> 39:47.210]  and they've got a relationship with the breeder.
[39:47.210 --> 39:50.810]  So the breeder probably told them that's this and this and these are the details.
[39:50.810 --> 39:55.010]  So they've usually got fairly good information most of the time
[39:55.010 --> 39:57.310]  with that same caveat that it's the internet
[39:57.310 --> 40:00.810]  and you've got to be smart at filtering through the bullshit on the internet.
[40:00.810 --> 40:06.210]  Now, another place that I can highly recommend to do research on genetics is breeder websites.
[40:06.210 --> 40:09.810]  If you know what breeder created that strain, go to their website.
[40:09.810 --> 40:12.210]  Now, not all the breeders have an up-to-date website.
[40:12.210 --> 40:13.410]  My website looks like shit.
[40:13.410 --> 40:15.210]  Not all of my current strains are up there.
[40:15.210 --> 40:17.510]  I am not versed in internet stuff.
[40:17.510 --> 40:20.010]  I've got a couple of friends that do that and that are working on it for me.
[40:20.010 --> 40:21.310]  It will be updated.
[40:21.310 --> 40:22.310]  I focus on the grow.
[40:22.310 --> 40:23.510]  I focus on the podcast.
[40:23.510 --> 40:24.710]  My website looks like shit.
[40:24.710 --> 40:25.810]  I am sorry.
[40:25.810 --> 40:29.610]  But some of the more established and guys that have been around for a longer time,
[40:29.610 --> 40:30.810]  they've got great websites.
[40:30.810 --> 40:32.910]  Subcool has a great website.
[40:32.910 --> 40:34.410]  Greenhouse Seeds has a great website.
[40:34.410 --> 40:36.910]  Of course, DNA Genetics has an amazing website.
[40:36.910 --> 40:38.410]  Folks like that have great websites.
[40:38.410 --> 40:42.610]  You can rely on the breeder website because we're putting the info up there ourselves
[40:42.610 --> 40:44.310]  and why would that be wrong?
[40:44.310 --> 40:49.410]  So, Leafly is not a bad place to check out strains.
[40:49.410 --> 40:55.710]  Seedfinder.edu, breeder websites, and vending websites, the places that sell seeds,
[40:55.710 --> 40:57.610]  Helladay Seed Company.
[40:57.610 --> 41:00.710]  I don't endorse buying seeds from overseas,
[41:00.710 --> 41:03.510]  but the Attitude Seed Bank has all the new shit listed.
[41:03.510 --> 41:05.610]  If you want to go see what they've got listed there,
[41:05.610 --> 41:09.610]  you can probably find a lot of genetic information there.
[41:09.610 --> 41:14.410]  But again, always cross-reference your research when you're working with cannabis
[41:14.410 --> 41:18.910]  because people are stoned and people will believe fucking anything.
[41:18.910 --> 41:23.110]  Honestly, if I told you I got this clone from DJ Short,
[41:23.110 --> 41:27.410]  and DJ Short got that clone from Ed Rosenthal in 1972,
[41:27.410 --> 41:31.110]  and then I took that clone and I bred it to wedding cake yesterday,
[41:31.110 --> 41:33.010]  and I gave you seeds, you're going to believe it.
[41:33.010 --> 41:35.110]  People will believe fucking anything.
[41:35.110 --> 41:38.210]  So, people are really gullible and you can tell them anything.
[41:38.210 --> 41:41.810]  So, the stories get really convoluted and shit gets really convoluted
[41:41.810 --> 41:43.310]  and distorted in the cannabis industry,
[41:43.310 --> 41:46.610]  and there's a lot of egos and dick swinging and dick slinging
[41:46.610 --> 41:48.210]  and shit talking and backstabbing.
[41:48.210 --> 41:49.910]  So, stories get mixed up a lot.
[41:49.910 --> 41:51.910]  So, if you want to know about genetics,
[41:51.910 --> 41:54.510]  get as close to the breeder as you can for the information
[41:54.510 --> 41:56.310]  because the closer you are to the source,
[41:56.310 --> 41:58.910]  the less that telephone game has been played.
[41:58.910 --> 42:03.210]  Like by the time you say, it's a blueberry cookies S1,
[42:03.210 --> 42:08.310]  then somebody else says it's a blueberry cross to cookies and it's a R1.
[42:08.310 --> 42:09.910]  So, they've already fucked it up, you know what I mean?
[42:09.910 --> 42:13.510]  And then you're like, yeah, it's blueberry cookies to...
[42:13.510 --> 42:15.610]  That's a blueberry cross to cookies, it's an F1.
[42:15.610 --> 42:17.110]  And you're like, oh, now it's really changing.
[42:17.110 --> 42:18.610]  And it just takes three or four conversations
[42:18.610 --> 42:20.310]  before you've got a totally different cross
[42:20.310 --> 42:22.010]  with different traits and different colors
[42:22.010 --> 42:23.210]  and a totally different conversation
[42:23.210 --> 42:25.310]  with somebody who's never seen or grown the plant.
[42:25.310 --> 42:27.110]  That's just how the cannabis industry works.
[42:27.110 --> 42:31.710]  So, I would do a lot of research and cross-reference things,
[42:31.710 --> 42:34.810]  but Leafly, SeedFinder, breeder websites,
[42:34.810 --> 42:39.110]  and of course, vendor websites are great places to do research.
[42:39.110 --> 42:41.710]  And it just occurred to me that I should not overlook
[42:41.710 --> 42:43.310]  the power of social media.
[42:43.310 --> 42:45.410]  If you want to know about the newest, hottest,
[42:45.410 --> 42:47.710]  most current strain that came out today,
[42:47.710 --> 42:50.010]  social media is where you're going to find that.
[42:50.010 --> 42:53.510]  So, I would follow some of the bigger accounts on social media,
[42:53.510 --> 42:55.410]  follow all the guys I mentioned,
[42:55.410 --> 42:57.410]  DNA Genetics, Greenhouse Seeds.
[42:57.410 --> 42:58.410]  Maybe you don't support them,
[42:58.410 --> 42:59.710]  maybe you're not into what they've got,
[42:59.710 --> 43:01.410]  but if you're interested in genetics,
[43:01.410 --> 43:02.710]  those are the guys to follow.
[43:02.710 --> 43:04.410]  And then once you follow DNA Genetics,
[43:04.410 --> 43:06.810]  Greenhouse Seeds, TGA Subcool,
[43:06.810 --> 43:08.910]  all the other seed breeders are going to start popping up
[43:08.910 --> 43:11.510]  in your recommendations, follow all of them.
[43:11.510 --> 43:13.710]  Then you'll get to see all the new stuff.
[43:13.710 --> 43:17.710]  Guys like Koma, guys like the Jungle Boys,
[43:17.710 --> 43:20.310]  and there are probably 10 or 20 new breeders
[43:20.310 --> 43:22.210]  that just popped up on Instagram just now
[43:22.210 --> 43:24.510]  while I was recording this that you'll want to follow,
[43:24.510 --> 43:25.910]  that have got the brand new hype shit,
[43:25.910 --> 43:29.110]  if you want to stay on top of all the brand new current strains.
[43:29.110 --> 43:31.310]  But it sounds like you're a really intelligent person,
[43:31.310 --> 43:33.010]  and it sounds like you know how to do research,
[43:33.010 --> 43:35.010]  and it sounds like you know what you're looking for.
[43:35.010 --> 43:37.710]  So, I think with the few links I gave you,
[43:37.710 --> 43:40.010]  I think you're off to a great start,
[43:40.010 --> 43:41.810]  and I think you're going to be a great asset
[43:41.810 --> 43:43.310]  to the cannabis industry
[43:43.310 --> 43:47.310]  once it becomes a viable option where you are.
[43:47.310 --> 43:48.910]  So, he wraps up the email and he says,
[43:48.910 --> 43:50.910]  thank you again for all that you do for the industry.
[43:50.910 --> 43:52.610]  It's very uncommon these days
[43:52.710 --> 43:56.710]  for people to share information so valuable, free of charge.
[43:56.710 --> 43:58.410]  You are truly an inspiration.
[43:58.410 --> 43:59.810]  Hey man, thanks for the huge compliment.
[43:59.810 --> 44:01.310]  Thank you for listening.
[44:01.310 --> 44:04.210]  It is free because I feel like if I didn't do this podcast,
[44:04.210 --> 44:06.710]  I might explode, something would go wrong.
[44:06.710 --> 44:08.610]  I've been a musician for most of my life,
[44:08.610 --> 44:11.710]  and I feel like if I don't play music every so often
[44:11.710 --> 44:14.510]  that I just get angsty, and my body gets tense,
[44:14.510 --> 44:15.410]  and I feel weird.
[44:15.410 --> 44:17.710]  I feel like the podcast has become an extension of that.
[44:17.710 --> 44:20.510]  If I don't put out all this knowledge and all this info,
[44:20.510 --> 44:22.410]  I feel like I'm just selfish and stingy,
[44:22.410 --> 44:24.210]  and something's going to just blow up inside me.
[44:24.210 --> 44:26.010]  So, I got to put it out there and share it with you guys.
[44:26.010 --> 44:28.510]  So, thanks for noticing, and thanks for the great email.
[44:28.510 --> 44:30.810]  If you have any more questions, man, send me an email.
[44:30.810 --> 44:34.710]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[44:34.710 --> 44:36.010]  All right, you guys, that's all the emails
[44:36.010 --> 44:37.810]  I am going to read on this episode.
[44:37.810 --> 44:39.610]  Before I start wrapping up the show,
[44:39.610 --> 44:42.110]  I owe a huge thank you to a new friend of mine.
[44:42.110 --> 44:44.710]  I got a great painting in the mail.
[44:44.710 --> 44:46.210]  If you follow my breeding work,
[44:46.210 --> 44:48.810]  I recently bred a couple of new strains.
[44:48.810 --> 44:50.110]  There's a pair of strains in there
[44:50.210 --> 44:52.610]  called Bebop and Rocksteady.
[44:52.610 --> 44:54.910]  One of my friends got a pack of the Bebop
[44:54.910 --> 44:56.910]  and a pack of the Rocksteady and grew it out,
[44:56.910 --> 44:59.110]  and they were happy with the results.
[44:59.110 --> 45:01.910]  So, they were kind enough to paint me a picture
[45:01.910 --> 45:04.110]  of Bebop and Rocksteady.
[45:04.110 --> 45:06.010]  They're kind of staring at me right now.
[45:06.010 --> 45:07.610]  You can tell they're nice and stoned.
[45:07.610 --> 45:09.210]  They're kind of surrounded by weed leaves,
[45:09.210 --> 45:11.910]  but it looks exactly like the Bebop and Rocksteady
[45:11.910 --> 45:13.710]  that we remember from being kids,
[45:13.710 --> 45:14.810]  and the painting is great.
[45:14.810 --> 45:16.010]  It's got a lot of purple going on.
[45:16.010 --> 45:17.710]  I really love the color scheme.
[45:17.710 --> 45:18.810]  It did a really good job.
[45:18.810 --> 45:20.410]  So, I want to give a huge shout out.
[45:20.410 --> 45:22.210]  The dude's name is Matt Marsongo,
[45:22.210 --> 45:27.410]  and on Instagram, he is M-M-A-R-S-A-N-G-O-M,
[45:27.410 --> 45:30.210]  Marsongo on Instagram, so make sure you check him out.
[45:30.210 --> 45:32.210]  Dude, once again, thanks for the great painting.
[45:32.210 --> 45:36.210]  That thing is awesome, and I truly appreciate the gift.
[45:36.210 --> 45:37.210]  All right, you guys, now's the time
[45:37.210 --> 45:38.710]  when I start wrapping up the podcast.
[45:38.710 --> 45:39.810]  Make sure you support our friends

[45:45.810 --> 45:46.910]  If you're listening to this episode

[45:48.510 --> 45:50.710]  they should have Lemon Jeffery seeds
[45:50.710 --> 45:54.210]  in stock at dankseed.store, so hit them up.
