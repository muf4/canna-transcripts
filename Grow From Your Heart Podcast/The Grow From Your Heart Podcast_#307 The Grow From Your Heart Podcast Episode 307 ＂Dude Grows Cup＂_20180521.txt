[00:10.080 --> 00:12.080]  news, education, and conversation.

[00:17.320 --> 00:21.360]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current

[01:29.240 --> 01:30.240]  Alright, podcast world.
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.440]  That's all the advertising I've got for you today.
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.400]  You know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[01:37.400 --> 01:40.800]  I feel like I've smoked a little bit of everything over the past weekend.
[01:40.800 --> 01:41.800]  I smoked flowers.
[01:41.800 --> 01:42.960]  I smoked dabs.
[01:42.960 --> 01:46.120]  I smoked a joint with dabs inside of it.
[01:46.120 --> 01:48.520]  I smoked every kind of concentrate I could imagine.
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.280]  I think you might be able to hear it in my voice, but it was great.
[01:52.280 --> 01:53.280]  It was worth it.
[01:53.280 --> 01:55.160]  But today, let's talk about what I've got in my hand right now.
[01:55.160 --> 02:01.160]  I've got some White Lightning number 7 sauce from our friends at Olio.
[02:01.160 --> 02:02.160]  It is Olio sauce.
[02:02.160 --> 02:04.080]  I'm cracking it open.
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.560]  It smells like banana runts.
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.400]  Like the banana shaped candies that you get out of the little quarter thing at the bowling
[02:11.400 --> 02:13.720]  alley or wherever you get them.
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.640]  It smells like banana runts with another sweetness on top of it.
[02:17.640 --> 02:20.600]  Maybe a hint of lemon maybe on top of the banana runt.
[02:20.600 --> 02:22.240]  A lemony banana runt.
[02:22.240 --> 02:24.080]  This concentrate, it's going quickly.
[02:24.080 --> 02:26.440]  There's one good crystal left in here.
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.560]  Once again, with Olio, I really appreciated the amount of sauce, which is the Terps, to
[02:32.560 --> 02:35.600]  crystals, which is the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.520]  The ratio was beautiful.
[02:37.520 --> 02:40.080]  About 30% Terps, 70% chunks.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.560]  It's really easy to dab that way.
[02:41.560 --> 02:43.120]  It's not a pain in the ass to get on the dabber.
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.520]  I don't feel like I'm wasting a lot of the juice.
[02:45.520 --> 02:47.520]  Great concentrate from our friends at Olio.
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.680]  I highly recommend that.
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.000]  The White Lightning number 7 sauce.
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  Delicious.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.960]  Kind of tastes like banana runts.
[02:54.960 --> 02:56.200]  If you're into banana, that's a good thing.
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.840]  If you're not into banana, this might not be the thing for you.
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.840]  All right.
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.400]  Shout out to our friends at Olio.
[03:02.400 --> 03:03.400]  Great concentrates.
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.960]  Now I said I've been smoking a little bit of everything.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.240]  Let's talk about why.
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.120]  I went to an event called the Dude Grows Cup.
[03:11.120 --> 03:14.400]  Let me tell you a little bit about what the Dude Grows Cup is.
[03:14.400 --> 03:18.400]  There's another podcast hosted by my friends, The Dude and Scotty Real.
[03:18.400 --> 03:19.400]  What's up guys?
[03:19.400 --> 03:20.400]  I hope you're listening.
[03:20.400 --> 03:22.720]  We're going to be going through an amazing event this weekend.
[03:22.720 --> 03:24.920]  Anyway, the Dude Grows Show.
[03:24.920 --> 03:26.400]  The Dude Grows Show is the podcast.
[03:26.400 --> 03:27.400]  That's the name of the show.
[03:27.400 --> 03:30.320]  The Dude and Scotty Real are the hosts and co-hosts.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.320]  Guru is the producer.
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.760]  There are a couple other cats that are on quite frequently.
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.760]  I'm always going to miss names.
[03:34.760 --> 03:36.400]  I feel bad because I'm a pothead and I forget names.
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.400]  But shout out everybody from the Dude Grows Show and the Dude Grows crew.
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.820]  These guys on the Dude Grows podcast decided that they're going to throw a cup.
[03:45.820 --> 03:47.440]  This year was their third cup.
[03:47.440 --> 03:49.780]  They've got some experience and they're getting really good at it.
[03:49.780 --> 03:51.580]  This was a great event.
[03:51.580 --> 03:53.060]  So it is a cup.
[03:53.060 --> 03:55.380]  Growers grow flowers.
[03:55.380 --> 03:56.380]  Their pot.
[03:56.380 --> 03:58.500]  And they enter their pot into this cup.
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.940]  And then a bunch of folks were invited.
[04:00.940 --> 04:02.940]  Myself and a lot of other people.
[04:02.940 --> 04:05.260]  I don't have a good headcount on how many people were in there.
[04:05.260 --> 04:09.060]  It was at a place called Cultivated Synergy and it was perfectly crowded.
[04:09.060 --> 04:13.060]  It was crowded enough to look like a big crowd but not so overcrowded that you were shoulder
[04:13.060 --> 04:14.420]  to shoulder bumping into people.
[04:14.420 --> 04:17.740]  But anyway, a bunch of people came.
[04:17.740 --> 04:19.160]  Everybody that grew their product came.
[04:19.540 --> 04:21.600]  There were at least 30, maybe 40 entries.
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.840]  So the way it worked, these people grew their product and they entered them, they turned
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.920]  them in, in a jar.
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.600]  And then these jars were all lined up across a, I would call it a bud bar in one section
[04:31.600 --> 04:32.600]  of the building.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.200]  The back wall of the building just had a long bud bar set up.
[04:36.200 --> 04:39.820]  And there were bud tenders behind that bar packing bowls for you.
[04:39.820 --> 04:42.760]  So if you walked up and you said, hey, can I try sample number one?
[04:42.760 --> 04:45.880]  The person behind that bud bar would pack up a bowl of sample number one for you.
[04:45.880 --> 04:46.880]  And it was just a small oney bowl.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  There were a bunch of fresh pipes laying around and people had pipes for days.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.960]  So you just walk up and say, hey, can I get a fresh sample of number one?
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.120]  And they'd pack up number one for you, take a little hit of it, see what you think of
[04:56.120 --> 04:59.240]  it, blow it out, and then get back in line and go try sample number two.
[04:59.240 --> 05:02.720]  And then get back in line and do sample number three and just work your way down the table.
[05:02.720 --> 05:04.760]  And there were 30 to 40 samples.
[05:04.760 --> 05:07.720]  So if you wanted to smoke all of them, you were going to be there for a little while
[05:07.720 --> 05:09.440]  because you had to stand in line between each one.
[05:09.440 --> 05:11.360]  And also you want to take a second between each puff.
[05:11.360 --> 05:14.520]  You don't want to smoke sample one, smoke sample two.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.560]  How are you going to tell what happened?
[05:16.560 --> 05:19.200]  Sample two is going to be the only one you notice.
[05:19.200 --> 05:21.800]  Maybe sample one is all you notice, but you didn't know because it was sample two.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.800]  See what I'm saying?
[05:22.800 --> 05:23.800]  You can't do it that way.
[05:23.800 --> 05:24.800]  So you got to take a minute anyway.
[05:24.800 --> 05:25.800]  So they were all lined up.
[05:25.800 --> 05:27.240]  People were, you take a smoke.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.040]  Then once you smoke all of the samples you want to try, then it was time to vote.
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.760]  And they gave us tokens that said the dude grows cup on them.
[05:34.760 --> 05:36.080]  And they were just little wood tokens.
[05:36.080 --> 05:39.900]  And you would place those in the corresponding jar numbered to which sample you like.
[05:39.900 --> 05:43.520]  So if you like sample number one or number 23 or whatever, you would go ahead and throw
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.080]  your coat, your little token, your coin into jar number one or jar number 23 to show that
[05:48.080 --> 05:49.600]  you had voted for that strain.
[05:49.600 --> 05:52.280]  And we were given three, four or five tokens.
[05:52.280 --> 05:57.440]  I don't remember how many tokens there were, but yeah, you were given tokens to vote with.
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.440]  That's how you voted.
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.440]  And then they just went through and counted how many votes there were for each one.
[06:01.440 --> 06:04.240]  And then they did announce the winners at the end of the night.
[06:04.240 --> 06:07.720]  I've got the list of winners right here.
[06:07.720 --> 06:10.240]  First place at the dude grows cup.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.360]  I don't know what they grew.
[06:11.360 --> 06:12.840]  I just have the names.
[06:12.840 --> 06:13.840]  First place.
[06:13.840 --> 06:14.840]  Or should I start at the bottom?
[06:14.840 --> 06:15.840]  Let's start at fourth place.
[06:15.840 --> 06:16.960]  I almost fucked that one up.
[06:16.960 --> 06:20.280]  Fourth place, you guys, was a friend of mine, was a friend of the show, was a friend of
[06:20.280 --> 06:21.520]  the dude grows crew.
[06:21.520 --> 06:26.080]  Fourth place was a very respectable, very honorable, very polite, very friendly young
[06:26.080 --> 06:27.080]  dude.
[06:27.080 --> 06:30.120]  My friend Moby Dill won fourth place at the dude grows cup.
[06:30.120 --> 06:32.080]  And I cannot remember the name of his entry.
[06:32.080 --> 06:35.320]  However, you'll hear this jar pop open.
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.600]  That is a little sample of it.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.200]  He gave me a nice size nugget.
[06:38.200 --> 06:40.920]  It's lemon G crossed to something.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.280]  He either called it Colorado pucker or a lemon pucker.
[06:44.280 --> 06:48.160]  I want to say he called it Colorado pucker and it's lemon G crossed to something.
[06:48.160 --> 06:50.480]  I can certainly see the ugly lemon G structure.
[06:50.480 --> 06:51.960]  I'm not dissing your grow.
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.960]  Lemon G is ugly to grow.
[06:52.960 --> 06:54.560]  You did a hell of a good job of it.
[06:54.560 --> 06:58.640]  Just the way this bud is shaped is obviously lemon G and it smells to high hell of lemon
[06:58.640 --> 07:01.040]  G greasy lemon funk.
[07:01.040 --> 07:04.840]  Oh, I'm just, I just keep smelling it over and over.
[07:04.840 --> 07:05.840]  This is amazing.
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.800]  As soon as I opened the jar, it kind of punched me in the face.
[07:07.800 --> 07:09.120]  It's almost overwhelming.
[07:09.120 --> 07:12.480]  This whole house is going to smell like that lemon turd for quite a while now.
[07:12.480 --> 07:14.520]  Moby Dill, much respect bro.
[07:14.520 --> 07:15.680]  Great grow.
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.680]  Fourth place.
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.360]  If that is fourth place, I can only imagine what first place smelled and tastes like.
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.360]  I may have smoked it.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.360]  I may have tried it.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.360]  I'm not sure.
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.560]  Anyway, we're going to keep going.
[07:25.560 --> 07:26.560]  Let's see.
[07:26.560 --> 07:28.440]  Second, third place.
[07:28.440 --> 07:31.620]  Third place was an entry by a person named Jaren.
[07:31.620 --> 07:33.520]  So shout out to Jaren.
[07:33.520 --> 07:36.840]  Second place was a person who called themselves Gwen Green Thumb.
[07:36.840 --> 07:38.500]  So shout out to Gwen Green Thumb.
[07:38.500 --> 07:43.900]  And then first place winner at the Dude Grows Cup was a person who called themselves Binsky.
[07:43.900 --> 07:46.900]  And I've actually heard a lot about Binsky going around the industry lately.
[07:46.900 --> 07:48.200]  That is a name that people are saying.
[07:48.200 --> 07:53.500]  So shout out to Binsky for being first place with the flower competition at the Dude Grows
[07:53.500 --> 07:54.500]  Cup.
[07:54.500 --> 07:55.500]  So let's talk about the cup a little bit.
[07:55.500 --> 07:56.500]  I told you what it was.
[07:56.500 --> 07:57.500]  I told you who won.
[07:57.500 --> 07:58.680]  I told you how it worked.
[07:58.680 --> 07:59.680]  People grew flowers.
[07:59.680 --> 08:00.680]  They entered flowers.
[08:00.680 --> 08:01.680]  We smoked flowers.
[08:01.680 --> 08:02.680]  We voted.
[08:02.680 --> 08:03.680]  They announced a winner.
[08:03.680 --> 08:05.660]  That's basically how a cup should go.
[08:05.660 --> 08:08.620]  It went smoothly in that aspect without a hitch.
[08:08.620 --> 08:10.540]  Nothing went wrong in my opinion.
[08:10.540 --> 08:13.300]  I got super lucky and found a really nice parking space.
[08:13.300 --> 08:15.140]  Otherwise that could have been kind of a pain in the ass.
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.000]  Because I had a lot of stuff to carry.
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.260]  But nothing went really wrong.
[08:18.260 --> 08:19.300]  Nothing was poorly planned this year.
[08:19.300 --> 08:21.820]  I think everything went fairly well.
[08:21.820 --> 08:24.020]  So man, I had a great time.
[08:24.020 --> 08:28.620]  One of my favorite parts about it is there were two or three different podcasts there.
[08:28.620 --> 08:30.100]  Of course, it is a Dude Grows event.
[08:30.100 --> 08:31.260]  It's hosted by the Dude Grows.
[08:31.260 --> 08:33.860]  They invite me, the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[08:33.860 --> 08:35.320]  I go up there and hang out.
[08:35.980 --> 08:38.160]  I met a couple other folks that have podcasts.
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.160]  Shout out you guys.
[08:39.160 --> 08:42.400]  I honestly am going to forget a lot of people that I want to give shout outs to because
[08:42.400 --> 08:44.360]  I got super lit and I had a super good time.
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.560]  I didn't write down names and shit, but I'll try to do my best to remember.
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.800]  My favorite part is that all these people get together.
[08:50.800 --> 08:53.280]  All these podcasters come together and we just all hang out.
[08:53.280 --> 08:56.200]  I get to meet people that listen to the Dude Grows show.
[08:56.200 --> 08:58.880]  I get to meet people that listen to my show.
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.120]  I get to meet people that found the Dude Show through my show and people that found my show
[09:03.120 --> 09:04.120]  through the Dude Show.
[09:04.440 --> 09:07.240]  It's just such a good time to get the community together.
[09:07.240 --> 09:12.600]  People that message me on social media and through email and however they contact me,
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.720]  mostly social media, right?
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.200]  I get to meet them and actually shake their hand and give them too big of a dab and watch
[09:17.200 --> 09:20.320]  them turn pale and try not to fall over because they're not from Colorado and they don't get
[09:20.320 --> 09:23.600]  to dab like that and I'm spoiled and I like to spoil them.
[09:23.600 --> 09:25.240]  That's what I love about it.
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.600]  It's such a good time because we get people from all over the country.
[09:29.640 --> 09:36.360]  A lot of the events are a bunch of younger kids and the music's too loud and it's a little
[09:36.360 --> 09:40.960]  obnoxious and it's mostly like a trade show, like an RV show.
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.720]  Everyone's just trying to sell shit and their way of selling you shit is by having hot girls
[09:44.720 --> 09:46.200]  and loud music.
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.400]  That doesn't happen at the Dude Grows Cup.
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.200]  There are plenty of beautiful ladies there but they are not vending anything.
[09:51.200 --> 09:53.840]  They're just there hanging out, smoking dabs.
[09:53.840 --> 09:55.080]  They're their part of the crew.
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.000]  They're not there for advertising.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.280]  The music is at a very acceptable level.
[09:59.280 --> 10:00.560]  I don't have a headache.
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.120]  My throat's only burnt out because I chose to talk way too much.
[10:04.120 --> 10:05.160]  I never stopped talking.
[10:05.160 --> 10:07.160]  I met so many cool people.
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.480]  A lot of the other events, the music's so loud that when I come home my throat hurts.
[10:11.480 --> 10:12.680]  The music is at a great level.
[10:12.680 --> 10:14.720]  This is a little bit of an older crowd.
[10:14.720 --> 10:16.280]  It's not the super young crowd.
[10:16.280 --> 10:17.600]  It's the next level up.
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.080]  So I kind of enjoy that aspect of it.
[10:20.080 --> 10:21.080]  It's super comfortable.
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.620]  I don't have any worries leaving my backpack sitting on the table and turning my head a
[10:24.620 --> 10:25.620]  few times.
[10:25.620 --> 10:27.120]  I don't feel like someone's going to rob me.
[10:27.120 --> 10:28.240]  I really like that.
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.440]  So it's a great event.
[10:29.440 --> 10:30.440]  The venue is awesome.
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.120]  Cultivated Synergy is great at hosting events like this.
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.360]  Shout out to Cultivated Synergy for taking good care of us.
[10:36.360 --> 10:37.880]  I really enjoyed the event.
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.440]  I got to meet a lot of my friends.
[10:39.440 --> 10:40.440]  I got to meet...
[10:40.440 --> 10:45.080]  So one of our friends, actually, there was a huge snowstorm east of here right before
[10:45.080 --> 10:46.080]  the event.
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.440]  And our friend, I'm not sure if he wants his name said, but one of our friends was trying
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.440]  to come in and he got snowed in and had to post pictures of himself stuck at a hotel
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.120]  saying I'm going to miss the Dude Grows Cup.
[10:56.120 --> 10:57.600]  And the community felt bad.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.080]  They're like, fuck, dude, that sucks.
[10:59.080 --> 11:01.080]  Everyone's messaging like, man, we hope to see you there, bro.
[11:01.080 --> 11:02.960]  Like, hopefully you figure it out.
[11:02.960 --> 11:06.640]  And then I met the Dude Grows Cup and this big guy walks up and introduces himself.
[11:06.640 --> 11:07.720]  And he's like, what's up, bro?
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.720]  This is me.
[11:08.720 --> 11:10.160]  And I was like, bro, I thought you were snowed in.
[11:10.160 --> 11:13.360]  And he's like, dude, we saw cars going on the highway and we got in the fucking car,
[11:13.360 --> 11:14.360]  man.
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.360]  I was like, hell yeah.
[11:15.360 --> 11:16.360]  So they got to make it.
[11:16.360 --> 11:17.760]  So a bunch of my friends got to make it to the cup.
[11:17.760 --> 11:20.720]  A bunch of people that I see on the Instagram live feeds made it to the cup.
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.160]  A bunch of people I message with.
[11:22.160 --> 11:24.560]  It was really cool to shake a bunch of their hands.
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.120]  Um, I don't want to leave anybody out, so I'm not going to say a whole bunch of names.
[11:29.120 --> 11:31.840]  I just want to give a huge shout out to the Dude and Scotty.
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.200]  Dude, thank you guys for inviting me to the cup.
[11:34.200 --> 11:35.360]  I had a great time.
[11:35.360 --> 11:36.360]  Your event is awesome.
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you can go to the Dude Grows Cup next year, it's going to happen
[11:39.600 --> 11:40.600]  next year.
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.600]  I invite you.
[11:41.600 --> 11:43.800]  Come take some dabs with me.
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.800]  Do not do this.
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.320]  What happens a lot of times is I get messages on Sunday saying, hey, bro, I saw you last
[11:48.320 --> 11:49.320]  night at the cup.
[11:49.320 --> 11:50.320]  I didn't want to say hi.
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.320]  You looked busy.
[11:51.320 --> 11:52.320]  I'm not busy.
[11:52.320 --> 11:54.280]  I'm there chit chatting and bullshitting and taking dabs with my friends.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.280]  But in say what's up?
[11:56.280 --> 11:57.280]  I don't want to put in.
[11:57.280 --> 11:58.280]  You do want to put it.
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.280]  Just be polite.
[11:59.280 --> 12:00.280]  Say, hey, I'm going to interrupt.
[12:00.280 --> 12:01.280]  I want to meet Jeff.
[12:01.280 --> 12:02.280]  I want to dab with Jeff.
[12:02.280 --> 12:03.280]  Come say hi.
[12:03.280 --> 12:04.280]  Shake my hand.
[12:04.280 --> 12:05.280]  Don't feel bad.
[12:05.280 --> 12:06.280]  I get super lit.
[12:06.280 --> 12:07.280]  Everyone else is super lit.
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.280]  The conversations just come and go.
[12:08.280 --> 12:11.160]  You'll say one sentence and then your attention drifts off to the next conversation.
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.160]  You try to keep up.
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.160]  Come say what's up to me.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.160]  Don't be shy.
[12:14.160 --> 12:15.160]  I want to be your friend.
[12:15.160 --> 12:16.640]  I want to meet you also.
[12:16.640 --> 12:18.560]  So I love the interaction.
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.560]  You guys.
[12:19.560 --> 12:20.560]  It was great meeting a lot of people.
[12:20.560 --> 12:21.560]  Come say hi.
[12:21.560 --> 12:23.560]  I don't even remember what the fuck I was saying.
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.720]  But I do want to talk about something that I did enjoy.
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.240]  I never caught the young man's name.
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.880]  There was a guy sitting across from me at this little bar area and we're taking some
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.840]  dabs and he pulled out some Bordello shatter and some Clementine shatter.
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.400]  I've been growing Bordello at Three Rivers for quite a while and we've made some shatter
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.400]  out of it.
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.960]  We've had a couple other companies make shatter for us and it's come out pretty good.
[12:47.160 --> 12:55.720]  This dude made some fucking Bordello shatter that brought out the sweetness to the Bordello.
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.680]  There's this undertone of sweetness and he brought it out so nice.
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.600]  So dude, whoever made that Bordello extract, if that is you, good job my friend.
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.000]  That stuff was delicious.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  It was so nice.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  I was ah.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.640]  It might have been like the first or second dab I took when I got there and I was carrying
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.560]  my bag and I'd been parking and I'd been driving for quite a while.
[13:16.560 --> 13:19.680]  When you run into an event and you see everybody, it's like tense for a second.
[13:19.680 --> 13:22.120]  I'm like, shit, I just want to put down my bag and relax.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.800]  So I put down my bag and my cooler and I got chilled out and I was kicking it.
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.200]  Then I took that dab and that just put me in like chill, like, all right, now it's time
[13:29.200 --> 13:31.200]  to be at the dude bros cup mode.
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.320]  So everything was just, just chilled out.
[13:34.320 --> 13:35.320]  It was perfect.
[13:35.320 --> 13:36.320]  I loved it.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.320]  All right.
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.820]  So shout out to the dude with the Bordello shatter.
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.320]  Never caught your name, dude.
[13:42.320 --> 13:43.320]  Thank you.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.720]  If you're a dab message me, if you hear this, let me know who you are and maybe we can meet
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.120]  up and take some dabs.
[13:48.120 --> 13:50.080]  I'd love to try some more of that Bordello.
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.080]  It was delicious.
[13:51.080 --> 13:52.080]  All right.
[13:52.080 --> 13:55.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you can attend the dude gross cup, I highly encourage you to
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.320]  do that next year.
[13:57.320 --> 13:58.940]  Make sure you go check out all the samples.
[13:58.940 --> 14:00.160]  Make sure you vote.
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.160]  Make sure you hang out.
[14:01.160 --> 14:02.880]  I got super lit.
[14:02.880 --> 14:06.520]  I walked in, I met up with some friends and hung out in one area for a little while.
[14:06.520 --> 14:07.520]  We took a bunch of dabs.
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.800]  Then I realized there was a bunch of space at that little bar area.
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.000]  I went over there, set up my dab area, and I just hung out and met a bunch of people.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.920]  Then they wanted to do the prize giveaway at that area.
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.680]  So that's when I drifted off to another area.
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.680]  That's when they did the awards.
[14:20.680 --> 14:23.680]  You guys, they gave away so many prizes that night.
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.040]  If you had raffle tickets, if you got in on the raffle, you were able to win so many cool
[14:28.040 --> 14:29.040]  prizes.
[14:29.040 --> 14:31.820]  If you go next year, get in on the raffle because you will win something.
[14:31.820 --> 14:35.280]  So many people leave early that all the people that stick around, that's who wins everything.
[14:35.280 --> 14:37.360]  So stick around, win some cool stuff.
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.840]  I was gifted some cannabis.
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.280]  A friend of mine, who I cannot remember their name, like I said, it was a cannabis event.
[14:43.280 --> 14:44.800]  I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.440]  I met a lot of goddamn people.
[14:46.440 --> 14:49.320]  I was gifted some flowers called Starfucker.
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.320]  If you gave me the Starfucker flowers, you're my new fucking hero.
[14:53.320 --> 14:55.240]  This shit smells so good.
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.040]  Oh my god, I can smell, I don't know the cross.
[14:57.040 --> 14:58.840]  I know there's some stardog in there.
[14:58.840 --> 15:00.360]  That's why it's called Starfucker.
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.440]  There's stardog in there for sure.
[15:01.440 --> 15:02.760]  I can smell the stardog.
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.400]  It's either Starkiller or Stardog.
[15:04.400 --> 15:05.800]  It smells like stardog to me.
[15:05.800 --> 15:07.520]  I don't know what the cross is.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.440]  Good fucking job, whoever grew this weed.
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.480]  Yeah, it's called Starfucker and it is Rostegev approved.
[15:13.480 --> 15:14.880]  I completely like that weed.
[15:14.880 --> 15:16.040]  It's super dense.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.320]  It smells like stardog.
[15:17.320 --> 15:20.520]  It's got great green and bright orange colors to it.
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.280]  It is, the density gets my attention and the aroma is kind of like old school weed.
[15:25.280 --> 15:27.120]  It's like weed used to get in California.
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.120]  It's got a little bit of chem.
[15:28.120 --> 15:30.520]  It's got a little bit of skunk going on to it.
[15:30.520 --> 15:31.520]  Super delicious weed.
[15:31.520 --> 15:33.320]  Good job, whoever gave me that.
[15:33.320 --> 15:34.720]  All right.
[15:34.720 --> 15:37.360]  So that's pretty much my wrap up of the Dude Grow Show, you guys.
[15:37.360 --> 15:39.320]  Not a lot to highlight.
[15:39.320 --> 15:40.400]  It was a great cup.
[15:40.400 --> 15:41.400]  I got lit.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.160]  I saw a bunch of great friends.
[15:43.160 --> 15:45.800]  That's what I was there for.
[15:45.800 --> 15:47.240]  Definitely worth the drive.
[15:47.240 --> 15:49.320]  Definitely worth the ticket price.
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.840]  If you go, get there early because parking in that area is kind of a bitch.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.920]  I got super lucky.
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.480]  Somebody pulled out of a spot and I was like, oh man, you got to dive in there and be aggressive
[15:58.480 --> 15:59.480]  in Denver.
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.840]  So yeah, go to the Dude Grows Cup and also listen to the Dude Grows podcast.
[16:04.840 --> 16:05.840]  That's right.
[16:05.840 --> 16:08.520]  Go in there and bake with the boys, roll up some weed and get high.
[16:08.520 --> 16:09.520]  That's what I think you should do.
[16:09.520 --> 16:11.080]  Shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows once again.
[16:11.080 --> 16:12.800]  Shout out to all the people that I met.
[16:12.800 --> 16:15.480]  Shout out to all the people that I got to hang out with.
[16:15.480 --> 16:19.300]  I'm not sure who wants their names said or not.
[16:19.300 --> 16:22.180]  So I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but I want to give you guys shout outs.
[16:22.180 --> 16:23.180]  It's kind of weird.
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.240]  It's kind of a fucking weird level there, a weird boundary.
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.160]  But my friend Matthew, I'm not going to say your full name, had a great time hanging out
[16:32.160 --> 16:33.560]  with you a whole bunch.
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.520]  Go to the Roach, Mangled Remains, good time.
[16:36.520 --> 16:38.440]  I don't want to forget anybody.
[16:38.440 --> 16:39.440]  So I'm going to stop there.
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.440]  You guys had a good time.
[16:40.440 --> 16:42.080]  Shout out to everybody that I hung out with.
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.480]  Shout out to my friends at New Millennium for taking care of me.
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.080]  Super big shout out to El Gringo de Mota.
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.600]  Dude, that super lemon haze that your friend grew was amazing.
[16:53.600 --> 16:56.720]  If you would have entered that, you probably would have had a good chance of winning.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.880]  That stuff was super nice.
[16:57.880 --> 16:59.600]  Anyway, you guys, that's enough names.
[16:59.600 --> 17:00.800]  I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
[17:00.800 --> 17:02.040]  I also don't want to forget anybody.
[17:02.040 --> 17:04.480]  I don't want to leave anybody out and feel bad.
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.200]  Shout out to all the people that introduced themselves, that walked up and shook my hand.
[17:08.200 --> 17:11.080]  Shout out to everybody who had good conversation with me.
[17:11.080 --> 17:13.280]  Shout out to everybody that I saw, that I dabbed with.
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.360]  I had a great time.
[17:14.360 --> 17:16.880]  I apologize that I'm no good with remembering names.
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.800]  When I see your face, I'll remember you.
[17:18.800 --> 17:20.240]  I will high five you.
[17:20.240 --> 17:22.640]  One thing we need to do is get name tags.
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.000]  We need to write, hi, my name is, and you need to put your real name and your Instagram
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.360]  name on there.
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.000]  Because for stoners, and everybody's got two fucking names, that gets to be a lot to remember.
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.760]  I was talking to a friend on my Instagram live video, and I didn't even realize who
[17:37.760 --> 17:42.840]  I was talking to, because I was like, what's up, Instagram handle 710425000?
[17:42.840 --> 17:45.040]  I'm just talking to him like he's some random dude.
[17:45.040 --> 17:48.760]  He's asking questions, and I was just being vague, because what he was asking was, I should
[17:48.760 --> 17:50.840]  be vague about that if I didn't know the guy.
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.640]  Eventually, he's like, hey, you know that it's me, right?
[17:53.640 --> 17:54.640]  He told me his real name.
[17:54.640 --> 17:55.640]  I was like, oh, fuck, dude.
[17:55.640 --> 17:59.120]  I didn't even realize that was you, because it's hard to keep up with all the Instagram
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.640]  names and real names.
[18:00.640 --> 18:01.640]  That's one thing that I would add.
[18:02.280 --> 18:05.320]  Those little hi, my name is, I would have those tags with your real name and then your
[18:05.320 --> 18:08.280]  Instagram name or whatever you're known as or whatever your company is.
[18:08.280 --> 18:13.080]  Mine would say, hi, I'm Rastajeff at iReadGenetics, so that people would be like, that is Rastajeff,
[18:13.080 --> 18:17.160]  just so there's no question, just so you guys can't say, I wasn't sure if that was you.
[18:17.160 --> 18:19.880]  You guys, I'm 6'5", and I have dreadlocks, and I'm wearing a Grow From Your Heart podcast
[18:19.880 --> 18:21.600]  t-shirt, and I'm taking gram dabs.
[18:21.600 --> 18:24.440]  I'm pretty easy to spot.
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.440]  Don't be shy.
[18:25.440 --> 18:26.440]  Come say hi.
[18:26.440 --> 18:28.960]  All right, there's one more quick thing I want to talk about before I start wrapping
[18:28.960 --> 18:29.960]  up this podcast.
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.440]  Let me find this little screenshot that I took.
[18:32.240 --> 18:33.240]  I thought this was entertaining.
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.640]  I work for a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division regulated business, and let's see
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.760]  who published this document.
[18:39.760 --> 18:48.920]  The Med, yes, the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division has passed out a, the Criminal Enforcement
[18:48.920 --> 18:52.240]  Division from the Department of Revenue is where this came from, which is part of the
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.060]  Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[18:55.060 --> 19:01.280]  They pass out a paper that says 420 reminders, and it says 420 reminders in the middle, and
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.520]  then it's like a bubble, a bubble, a cluster chart.
[19:04.520 --> 19:05.680]  I don't remember what they call these.
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.520]  Like when you're supposed to get ideas in school, and you make a circle, and you write
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.160]  podcasts, and you make notes coming off it, and you make another circle, and it says,
[19:12.160 --> 19:13.160]  talk about weed.
[19:13.160 --> 19:14.160]  Another circle comes off it.
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.160]  It says, talk about education.
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.160]  They made one of these.
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.400]  In the middle, it says, reminders, and I'm going to read you guys the reminders that
[19:20.400 --> 19:22.080]  they have issued to the dispensaries.
[19:22.080 --> 19:27.960]  The top one says, no sales to non-patients and persons under 21 years of age.
[19:27.960 --> 19:30.080]  Most vertical IDs equal under 21.
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.800]  What that means is no sales to non-patients.
[19:32.800 --> 19:37.760]  If you're a medical marijuana dispenser, you cannot sell to anybody who is not a registered
[19:37.760 --> 19:43.520]  patient with a current active card and valid ID, and persons under the age of 21.
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.160]  If you are a recreational store, you are able to sell to anyone with a 21 and up ID.
[19:48.160 --> 19:50.200]  If they're not 21 and up, you cannot sell to them.
[19:50.200 --> 19:51.800]  They also give you a hint.
[19:51.800 --> 19:54.320]  Most vertical IDs equal under 21.
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.440]  If you've got a vertical ID, the vertical goes the long way, that probably means that
[19:58.440 --> 19:59.900]  you are a minor.
[20:00.720 --> 20:01.720]  You are not buying cannabis.
[20:01.720 --> 20:04.580]  All right, there's another bubble, and it says, no public consumption.
[20:04.580 --> 20:09.300]  It is violation of state and local laws, and person could be subject to criminal charges.
[20:09.300 --> 20:14.260]  They're just reminding you for 420 to remind your customers, no public consumption.
[20:14.260 --> 20:17.700]  The next one says, visitors in limited access areas.
[20:17.700 --> 20:22.500]  Visitors must be escorted by employee, five per employee, which I thought was four, so
[20:22.500 --> 20:23.700]  that's an increase.
[20:23.700 --> 20:28.700]  If you're going to take people that are not badged and not employees into a cultivation
[20:28.700 --> 20:32.300]  facility, they must be escorted by a key badged employee.
[20:32.300 --> 20:33.300]  You must have a key badge.
[20:33.300 --> 20:34.300]  You can't have a support badge.
[20:34.300 --> 20:38.500]  You have to have a key badge or an owner badge, and you have to escort those people through
[20:38.500 --> 20:41.900]  the facility, and you cannot do more than five people at one time.
[20:41.900 --> 20:45.340]  If you're going to bring a band through, if you're going to bring Fortunate Youth Loves
[20:45.340 --> 20:47.500]  to Go Through Grows, I think there's like five or six of them.
[20:47.500 --> 20:50.900]  You could bring five of them per person, so you got to have two people to have the full
[20:50.900 --> 20:53.820]  band going through there probably to escort them.
[20:53.820 --> 20:57.700]  If a rapper comes through, if Wiz Khalifa comes through by himself, one person can escort
[20:57.700 --> 21:02.500]  Wiz, just one on one, but you have to have one person for every five visitors, and that
[21:02.500 --> 21:05.180]  one person has to be a key badge.
[21:05.180 --> 21:06.180]  You guys don't have to worry about that.
[21:06.180 --> 21:08.900]  I'm just telling you the weird things that the MED is reminding us of.
[21:08.900 --> 21:10.300]  That's because people come from out of town.
[21:10.300 --> 21:14.020]  They know that celebrities are going to fly into Colorado, and oftentimes when that happens,
[21:14.020 --> 21:19.180]  you see pictures of said celebrities on social media and grows in Colorado, and a lot of
[21:19.180 --> 21:22.420]  the grows, if you've been to a few of them, you can recognize them.
[21:22.420 --> 21:24.380]  I can scroll through and be like, oh, that's that grow.
[21:24.380 --> 21:27.220]  That's that grow, just because I've seen them a lot, and I know who does what.
[21:27.220 --> 21:31.900]  So the MED sees that, and they're like, oh, look, this bunch of rappers is in this grow,
[21:31.900 --> 21:34.260]  and here's one guy with the badge, and they can see that shit.
[21:34.260 --> 21:36.020]  So be careful if you're doing that.
[21:36.020 --> 21:38.780]  Also if you have a, this is not on the paper, but if you have visitors in there, don't let
[21:38.780 --> 21:43.060]  them touch product, and don't post pictures of people touching product, because visitors
[21:43.060 --> 21:44.060]  cannot touch product.
[21:44.060 --> 21:45.060]  That's illegal.
[21:45.060 --> 21:46.060]  All right.
[21:46.060 --> 21:47.060]  I'm going to continue with the bubbles.
[21:47.060 --> 21:49.420]  The next bubble says, no free product.
[21:49.420 --> 21:53.380]  You cannot give away marijuana or marijuana product to a consumer for any reason.
[21:53.380 --> 21:55.500]  So that means no free shit.
[21:55.820 --> 21:57.820]  You can't say buy two of these, get one free.
[21:57.820 --> 21:58.820]  You can't do that.
[21:58.820 --> 22:02.180]  You can say buy two, get one for a penny, but you can't do them for free.
[22:02.180 --> 22:04.860]  There are loopholes around everything, but no free shit.
[22:04.860 --> 22:11.260]  Sales limits, one ounce of flour is equal to 80, 10 milligram servings in edibles or
[22:11.260 --> 22:13.140]  eight grams of concentrates.
[22:13.140 --> 22:17.340]  So if you are an out of state shopper, or if you're shopping recreationally, and that's
[22:17.340 --> 22:19.500]  just a recreational thing, that's not a medical marijuana thing.
[22:19.500 --> 22:21.120]  This is recreational.
[22:21.120 --> 22:28.040]  One ounce of flours is equal to 80, 10 milligrams serving edibles or eight grams of concentrates.
[22:28.040 --> 22:31.840]  So that's how they do the math on deciding how much you are allowed to purchase.
[22:31.840 --> 22:36.280]  So if you're coming from out of state and you want to reach your limit, that's the conversion
[22:36.280 --> 22:38.140]  that you have to do to break it down.
[22:38.140 --> 22:46.040]  You can either get 80, 10 milligram servings of edibles or eight grams of concentrates.
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.040]  Those are your limits.
[22:47.040 --> 22:48.040]  All right.
[22:48.040 --> 22:49.040]  So I'm going to continue on with the little bubble.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.040]  Here's the red bubble.
[22:50.040 --> 22:51.720]  No consumption on premises.
[22:51.720 --> 22:57.160]  A licensee shall not permit consumption of MJ or MJ product on premises.
[22:57.160 --> 22:59.120]  So no marijuana consumption on site.
[22:59.120 --> 23:02.200]  A lot of people think you can go to the dispensary and smoke weed there.
[23:02.200 --> 23:04.800]  A lot of people think we're at the gross smoking weed there.
[23:04.800 --> 23:09.480]  No, you cannot smoke weed anywhere regulated by the marijuana enforcement division.
[23:09.480 --> 23:11.800]  Everything is on camera from a thousand different angles.
[23:11.800 --> 23:14.740]  There is nowhere I can go in that building to pick my nose or scratch my ass that will
[23:14.740 --> 23:17.280]  not be on camera other than a restroom.
[23:17.280 --> 23:21.620]  Every square inch of that facility is on camera, probably from two angles.
[23:21.620 --> 23:23.720]  They want you on camera from two angles at all times.
[23:23.720 --> 23:25.840]  All right, we'll keep moving.
[23:25.840 --> 23:32.560]  That says hours of operation, no sales before or after 8am to 12am unless restricted further
[23:32.560 --> 23:33.840]  by local jurisdiction.
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.320]  Some of the places around here I think are forced to be done by nine.
[23:37.320 --> 23:39.080]  I think the rule is I'm not certain on that.
[23:39.080 --> 23:41.240]  I don't shop at a dispensary a lot to tell you the truth, guys.
[23:41.240 --> 23:43.460]  I only go to one and it's in Colorado Springs.
[23:43.460 --> 23:44.460]  They are regulated.
[23:44.580 --> 23:48.300]  They are forced to close at nine o'clock in Springs and they're medical only.
[23:48.300 --> 23:49.420]  So the bubbles continue.
[23:49.420 --> 23:53.860]  They say check ID must be valid government issued ID.
[23:53.860 --> 23:55.600]  So you can use your military ID.
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.820]  You can use your normal state issued ID.
[23:57.820 --> 24:01.820]  You can use your passport, but you have to have a valid government issued ID.
[24:01.820 --> 24:03.300]  It cannot be expired.
[24:03.300 --> 24:07.340]  Advertising, it just says follow appropriate requirements for advertising.
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.940]  You're not allowed to have sign spinners.
[24:08.940 --> 24:10.940]  You can't do that kind of stuff.
[24:11.940 --> 24:15.060]  Centers can only have patient to ounce allowance.
[24:15.060 --> 24:16.060]  That's right.
[24:16.060 --> 24:19.220]  If it's a medical marijuana center, the amount of product you're allowed to have on hand
[24:19.220 --> 24:24.700]  is based on how many people are signed up for you as their provider for that facility.
[24:24.700 --> 24:28.100]  So you're only allowed to have your patient to ounce allowance.
[24:28.100 --> 24:29.900]  You can't overload because it's 420.
[24:29.900 --> 24:34.060]  You can't have extra inventory on stock because you plan on running through it.
[24:34.060 --> 24:39.820]  You're going to have to have a driver at your grow or wherever your product is stored, ready
[24:39.940 --> 24:42.540]  to transfer that product at on demand.
[24:42.540 --> 24:46.540]  Whenever you run out of a jar or a few pounds of something and you can take a five pound
[24:46.540 --> 24:48.500]  delivery, you got to have a guy bring you more.
[24:48.500 --> 24:52.380]  So you can't have extra onsite just because it's 420.
[24:52.380 --> 24:56.260]  Then the last bubble says licensee may refuse sales.
[24:56.260 --> 24:58.860]  Example to a person who is impaired.
[24:58.860 --> 25:02.940]  They're just reminding you that you've got the right to refuse service to anybody should
[25:02.940 --> 25:03.940]  you so choose.
[25:03.940 --> 25:07.060]  If somebody walks into your dispensary and you just don't feel right, you do have the
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.700]  right to refuse service to that person.
[25:08.700 --> 25:11.620]  If you think they're a federal agent, if you think their ID may be fake, if you think
[25:11.620 --> 25:15.380]  they're intoxicated, if you just don't want to sell to them because it doesn't feel good
[25:15.380 --> 25:18.060]  in your heart, you were allowed to say no.
[25:18.060 --> 25:20.100]  All right.
[25:20.100 --> 25:25.140]  So that is a little bubble of a little memo of bubbles sent out by the Colorado Marijuana
[25:25.140 --> 25:29.020]  Enforcement Division to all of the businesses just to remind the businesses how to keep
[25:29.020 --> 25:31.140]  themselves out of trouble for 420.
[25:31.140 --> 25:35.420]  Of course, we did have one facility experience some problems and they got themselves in trouble.
[25:35.420 --> 25:38.420]  So they're trying to help us out and make sure that doesn't happen anymore.
[25:39.140 --> 25:41.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed this episode of the podcast.
[25:41.100 --> 25:42.220]  My throat's starting to burn out.
[25:42.220 --> 25:43.220]  It's Thursday.
[25:43.220 --> 25:44.220]  This was supposed to be a quickie.
[25:44.220 --> 25:46.580]  I feel like I went kind of long by myself anyway.
[25:46.580 --> 25:48.700]  So thanks for hanging out.
[25:48.700 --> 25:50.980]  This episode is going to come out the day before 420.
[25:50.980 --> 25:54.260]  So I want to wish everybody a safe and happy 420.
[25:54.260 --> 25:57.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, smoke a whole bunch of good cannabis, but take care of each other.
[25:57.640 --> 26:00.780]  Don't do anything stupid.

[26:02.100 --> 26:03.100]  All right.

[27:03.420 --> 27:04.420]  crew.
[27:04.420 --> 27:06.420]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug.
