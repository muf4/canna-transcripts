[00:05.880 --> 00:10.880]  Welcome back podcast world. It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.880 --> 00:13.880]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:13.880 --> 00:19.880]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:19.880 --> 00:23.880]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:23.880 --> 00:26.880]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:26.880 --> 00:30.880]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:31.880 --> 00:35.880]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:35.880 --> 00:40.880]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:40.880 --> 00:43.880]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat split, put some fresh water in the bomb,
[00:47.880 --> 00:52.880]  or start heating up that dab nail because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 338 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.880]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.880]  As I mentioned before, this episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.880]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, make sure you check out dankseed.store.
[01:07.880 --> 01:11.880]  You guys know I like to start this episode off by letting you know what I'm dabbing on.
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.880]  Today, I just came back from the dispensary with some fresh dabs.
[01:15.880 --> 01:19.880]  I picked up some blue cheese, full spectrum extract,
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.880]  that is UK cheese and blueberry.
[01:22.880 --> 01:25.880]  The description on the container is berries and cheese.
[01:25.880 --> 01:28.880]  I got a lot of cheese, a little bit of berries, and then a little bit of dirty feet at the end,
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.880]  which I really appreciate in my concentrates.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.880]  I also picked up more of this Orange Earth Nectar.
[01:34.880 --> 01:37.880]  It's orange OG and orange juice bud.
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.880]  The package describes the aroma and flavor as ammonia, tangerines, diesel, and hibiscus.
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.880]  I get the orange, I get the diesel, but the hibiscus, I'm not sure.
[01:46.880 --> 01:49.880]  I get the diesel, but the hibiscus, I'm not sure if I would recognize that if it punched me in the face.
[01:49.880 --> 01:52.880]  I get the diesel, but the hibiscus, I'm not sure if I would recognize that if it punched me in the face.
[01:52.880 --> 01:55.880]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today, you guys.
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.880]  I got the blue cheese, and I've got the Orange Earth Nectar, both from Green Dot Labs.
[01:58.880 --> 02:01.880]  I also picked up a grab of the Doctor Who full spectrum extract.
[02:01.880 --> 02:04.880]  It's described as passion fruit, guava, and strawberry taffy.
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.880]  I haven't busted this gram open yet. I've tried this.
[02:07.880 --> 02:10.880]  It is always a satisfying concentrate.
[02:10.880 --> 02:13.880]  I also picked up a little bit of the guava papaya nectar,
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.880]  described as sour, and fuel, and soft fruits.
[02:16.880 --> 02:19.880]  I'm not sure what soft fruits they're speaking of,
[02:19.880 --> 02:22.880]  but it did have the fuel-y funk to it.
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.880]  It did have the sourness to it, and then it had the aftertaste of maybe
[02:25.880 --> 02:28.880]  a green gummy worm, or something in that green candy sort of a flavor.
[02:28.880 --> 02:31.880]  a green gummy worm, or something in that green candy sort of a flavor.
[02:31.880 --> 02:34.880]  So, great concentrates from our friends at Green Dot. They have been killing it lately.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.880]  That's what I'll be smoking on on this beautiful, rainy, cool weekend.
[02:37.880 --> 02:40.880]  It's been so hot in Colorado, you guys, and it's been raining for a couple of days now.
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.880]  It has been so nice. It's been 100 degrees every day.
[02:43.880 --> 02:46.880]  It is 77 degrees outside. It was so nice to go for a drive,
[02:46.880 --> 02:49.880]  get a little bit of rain on the windshield.
[02:49.880 --> 02:52.880]  It's actually a nice relief.
[02:52.880 --> 02:55.880]  Alright, you guys don't want to hear about the weather.
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.880]  Let's talk about podcasting. A little bit of an equipment update.
[02:58.880 --> 03:01.880]  You guys know that I had some equipment failure in the podcast.
[03:01.880 --> 03:04.880]  You've heard it in the past couple of episodes.
[03:04.880 --> 03:07.880]  Everyone says quit apologizing, but I'm honestly, sincerely, I'm sorry that it sounds like shit.
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.880]  That's not my style. I'm going to record an episode where I'm going to read listener emails.
[03:10.880 --> 03:13.880]  That way, if something craps out, we're not losing too much technical information.
[03:13.880 --> 03:16.880]  I don't feel like I put together a really intensive episode
[03:16.880 --> 03:19.880]  and had a tech failure.
[03:19.880 --> 03:22.880]  I'm going to do a couple of email episodes until I get things solved.
[03:22.880 --> 03:25.880]  And once I'm confident in the equipment again, we will get back to those intensive grow lessons.
[03:25.880 --> 03:28.880]  I promise they're coming.
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.880]  You guys have already got some of them written out, so I want to put them out.
[03:31.880 --> 03:34.880]  I just don't want to frustrate myself by putting them out half-assed.
[03:34.880 --> 03:37.880]  Bear with me while I work through some email episodes.
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.880]  A couple of random topics. We'll have a couple of fun episodes here.
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.880]  Then we're going to get back into it.
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.880]  We'll get back into those really educational and intensive episodes.
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.880]  I just want to make sure that everything works and I can get it to you guys
[03:49.880 --> 03:52.880]  in the Rasta Jeff expected style.
[03:52.880 --> 03:55.880]  That's enough rambling about equipment and updates.
[03:55.880 --> 03:58.880]  Where else are we? You guys, I've been talking about the Lemon Jeffrey and the Golden Goat
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.880]  Femini seeds that are coming.
[04:01.880 --> 04:04.880]  They've been chopped down. They are drying. They're hanging.
[04:04.880 --> 04:07.880]  It will take several days for those plants to become dry enough for me to even think about
[04:07.880 --> 04:10.880]  making them smaller so that I can start pulling the seeds out.
[04:10.880 --> 04:13.880]  I've got to let the plants dry. They've got to get cut down into smaller pieces.
[04:13.880 --> 04:16.880]  The buds have to get chopped into tiny, tiny pieces.
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.880]  Then I sift through and get every single seed out and remove it from the material.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.880]  Then they've got to get packaged.
[04:22.880 --> 04:25.880]  It will be a little while before they are available, but they have been harvested.
[04:25.880 --> 04:28.880]  There are very few seeds in this batch.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.880]  I talked earlier that it took me a few extra sprays to get that Golden Goat
[04:31.880 --> 04:34.880]  to reverse this time. It just did not want to go for me.
[04:34.880 --> 04:37.880]  I had to hit it a couple extra times more than I usually would.
[04:37.880 --> 04:40.880]  It finally reversed. I got pollen out of it.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.880]  I did not make as many seeds as we would have hoped for.
[04:43.880 --> 04:46.880]  I know what went wrong. I know what happened. I just don't know why.
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.880]  So I will make more again in the near future.
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.880]  There will be a regular seed run. Then I will consider more
[04:52.880 --> 04:55.880]  Feminized Lemon Jeff and Golden Goat seeds
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.880]  based on the sales of this current batch.
[04:58.880 --> 05:01.880]  Those are done. They will be ready in just a little bit.
[05:01.880 --> 05:04.880]  They will be very limited in this batch. Stay tuned if you are interested.
[05:04.880 --> 05:07.880]  Alright, let's move into some news before we get to some listener emails.
[05:07.880 --> 05:10.880]  If you've been following the podcast, you know that I've been updating you
[05:10.880 --> 05:13.880]  on a chain of dispensaries in Colorado known as Sweetleaf.
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.880]  I'll give you a quick update and then we'll get into the current situation.
[05:16.880 --> 05:19.880]  Sweetleaf had several dispensaries in Denver.
[05:19.880 --> 05:22.880]  They were charged with what was known as looping.
[05:22.880 --> 05:25.880]  In Colorado, a customer is allowed to buy one ounce per person per day.
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.880]  Sweetleaf was breaking the rule and letting people come back
[05:28.880 --> 05:31.880]  multiple times a day to buy more than one ounce,
[05:31.880 --> 05:34.880]  which was deemed to be illegal.
[05:34.880 --> 05:37.880]  The dispensary was raided and shut down.
[05:37.880 --> 05:40.880]  Their licenses in Denver were taken.
[05:40.880 --> 05:43.880]  They had a few stores with remaining licenses until we read this article.
[05:43.880 --> 05:46.880]  This article comes from the Westward. It was written by Thomas Mitchell
[05:46.880 --> 05:49.880]  and it goes like this. The headline is
[05:49.880 --> 05:52.880]  Sweetleaf isn't out of the law enforcement and regulatory crosshairs
[05:52.880 --> 05:55.880]  just because its Denver stores are no longer open.
[05:55.880 --> 05:58.880]  Its licenses for the three remaining Sweetleaf dispensaries
[05:58.880 --> 06:01.880]  in the metro area were all suspended by the state marijuana
[06:01.880 --> 06:04.880]  enforcement division as of today, July 26th.
[06:04.880 --> 06:07.880]  You guys, I'm recording on the 27th.
[06:07.880 --> 06:10.880]  MED signs on the doors of Sweetleaf dispensaries in Aurora,
[06:10.880 --> 06:13.880]  Federal Heights, and Thornton all say the store is closed.
[06:13.880 --> 06:16.880]  The store is closed.
[06:16.880 --> 06:19.880]  MED signs on the doors of Sweetleaf dispensaries in Aurora,
[06:19.880 --> 06:22.880]  Federal Heights, and Thornton all say the store's licenses
[06:22.880 --> 06:25.880]  are suspended for alleged violation of state medical
[06:25.880 --> 06:28.880]  or retail marijuana codes.
[06:28.880 --> 06:31.880]  While the MED Communications Director Shannon Gray
[06:31.880 --> 06:34.880]  confirmed the closures,
[06:34.880 --> 06:37.880]  she declined to go into further detail, other than nothing that
[06:37.880 --> 06:40.880]  Sweetleaf is part of an ongoing investigation and that
[06:40.880 --> 06:43.880]  any further MED disciplinary action will depend on the results of the investigation.
[06:43.880 --> 06:47.920]  agencies helped the MED serve the suspensions. You guys, there's more to
[06:47.920 --> 06:50.920]  this article, but it just basically updates us from what happened in the
[06:50.920 --> 06:55.340]  past. So Sweetleaf had a few more dispensaries, and now they have been shut
[06:55.340 --> 06:59.400]  down. Sweetleaf is really struggling. You guys, I will keep you updated with what
[06:59.400 --> 07:04.240]  goes on with the Sweetleaf closures as things progress. All right, now let's
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.580]  shift gears a little bit and work on some listener emails. If you guys want
[07:07.580 --> 07:10.320]  to send me an email to read on the show, my email address is
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.080]  growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. I do appreciate the interaction. I do
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.120]  apologize I have not responded to emails on the show in quite a while. I've been
[07:19.120 --> 07:22.480]  working on those grow lessons as you have heard, but I've got an opportunity
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.040]  for some emails, so let's get right into it. Several days ago I was on a podcast
[07:27.040 --> 07:31.560]  called the Growing with Fishes podcast, and they asked me a question about what
[07:31.560 --> 07:36.040]  was coming up for my podcast and what I had planned for the future. My response
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.760]  to that question was that I wanted to learn how to interview breeders better
[07:39.760 --> 07:43.760]  and have more people on the show. That didn't mean that I wanted to abandon
[07:43.760 --> 07:47.200]  the format and totally change everything. It just meant that it would be nice to
[07:47.200 --> 07:50.960]  be able to call up my buddy Subcool and talk to Subcool and get him on the show.
[07:50.960 --> 07:55.000]  It'd be cool to go up to Denver and see Colin from the Ethos Collective and get
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.600]  him on the podcast. It would be cool to get Mr. Soul, because they all live just
[07:58.600 --> 08:01.880]  right in Denver. They're not too far away from me. It'd be great to have them on
[08:01.880 --> 08:05.680]  the show, but I need to practice on people who aren't, who don't intimidate
[08:05.680 --> 08:09.120]  me, who I don't have so much respect for, I guess, and get better at actually
[08:09.240 --> 08:12.560]  interviewing people. So one of the things I said is that I wanted to become a
[08:12.560 --> 08:17.000]  better interviewer and interview folks on the show. That inspired this email.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.040]  This is from somebody who I've interacted with several times. I'm not
[08:20.040 --> 08:23.200]  sure if they want their name said on the show, so I will just read their message.
[08:23.200 --> 08:27.440]  And the message goes like this. He said, I just want to tell you, you're doing a
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.680]  great job, and I enjoyed the show Growing with Fishes this morning. Please do not
[08:31.680 --> 08:35.880]  change anything. Please do not change your concept. We enjoy learning from you.
[08:35.880 --> 08:40.040]  An interview show every now and then is okay, but keep doing the good work that
[08:40.040 --> 08:44.520]  you do. I have learned so much from you, and my product is so much better. My
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.520]  patients love my product now that I have been learning by who it feels is one of
[08:48.520 --> 08:52.160]  the greatest teachers out there. I've listened to other podcasts and other
[08:52.160 --> 08:56.840]  shows, and none of them compare to yours. Then he also asked for some suggestions.
[08:56.840 --> 08:59.680]  He said, I just wanted to know if you have any suggestions with one of your
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.320]  plants. And then he sends me a picture of a Scarlet Begonias plant that looks
[09:03.320 --> 09:07.000]  beautiful. He said, I grew it from seed. It's about four feet tall now, but it has
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.800]  stopped growing and just flowering out. Thanks for all of your help, and keep up
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.440]  the good work in this community. And let me back up. There are a lot of great
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.240]  things to touch on. First, he says I'm doing a good job. Dude, thank you for the
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.160]  compliments. I appreciate that. I was struggling for a couple episodes with
[09:22.160 --> 09:26.040]  the show, but I feel like we are back on track. Thank you for listening to the
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.920]  Growing with Fishes show. I hope you enjoyed that. That is available on
[09:28.920 --> 09:32.360]  YouTube for everybody else to listen to if you didn't catch it the first time.
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.240]  Then he says, do not change anything. Don't change your concept because you
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.880]  enjoy learning. I do not plan to change anything. I just want to add a couple of
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.720]  more things to what I can do. I need to be more versatile in my podcast. Imagine
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.720]  how many people would listen if we had Subcool on here. Imagine how many more
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.240]  people would it would expose the show to. So things like that are advantageous for
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.960]  a podcast. You've got the right idea. An interview every now and then would be
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.600]  cool. And I do plan on keeping up the Grow Lessons and the Grow Episodes. That's
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.760]  my goal. And dude, you said you're learning by who it feels is one of the
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.520]  greatest teachers out there. Thank you. I appreciate that. That means a lot to me.
[10:09.520 --> 10:12.880]  It means a lot that people are learning from me, that your garden is getting
[10:12.880 --> 10:15.720]  better, that your patients are enjoying your garden better, and that you are
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.560]  probably just enjoying growing more because of a little bit of time that I
[10:19.560 --> 10:22.480]  put into this show. So thank you for listening. Thank you for the great email,
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.120]  and thank you for the support. Then you say you listen to other podcasts and
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.760]  none of them compare. That means a lot to me, bro. Thank you. Then let's get into
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.080]  this plant that you're talking about. He said, I grew that from seed. It's about
[10:34.080 --> 10:37.720]  four feet tall. You guys, this plant is a monster. It is four feet tall. It is
[10:37.720 --> 10:41.840]  definitely sativa dominant. He's got it behind a brick fence. It is going to grow
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.520]  way over that block wall before the end of the season. It says, I grew it from
[10:46.520 --> 10:50.120]  seed. It's about four feet tall, but it has stopped growing and just flowering
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.560]  out. Thanks for all of your help and keep up the good work. It's flowering out
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.760]  because it has reached its critical period. It is getting a long enough night
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.560]  cycle now to where that plant knows that fall and winter are coming and it needs
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.200]  to flower. It is doing exactly what it is supposed to do. It is a photo period
[11:07.200 --> 11:10.720]  plant. That means that when the fall starts coming, when the light cycle
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.960]  starts getting shorter, we have longer nights and shorter days, that plant goes,
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.240]  oh, it is time for me to start putting out my buds because it wants to flower
[11:19.240 --> 11:22.880]  out. It's an annual plant. These are only supposed to live for one year. So now
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.600]  it's going to put out its buds. The whole goal of this plant is to get pollinated.
[11:26.600 --> 11:29.880]  It's going to put out buds with big sticky pistils. Those are the hairs. Its
[11:29.880 --> 11:33.080]  goal is to get pollinated. It won't get pollinated, hopefully. Hopefully no one
[11:33.080 --> 11:35.880]  in your neighborhood's got a male outdoors. So it's not going to get
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.720]  pollinated. It'll just keep stacking up calyxes, which are basically where the
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.680]  seeds would go because it wants seeds. It wants to create seed so that at the end
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.960]  of the season, it can dry up. It would still be standing there on the stalk at
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.760]  the end of the season if it weren't disturbed by any people or anything. If
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.040]  this were nature, it would dry out on that stick and then those seeds would
[11:54.040 --> 11:57.400]  fall into the dirt and then it would freeze over over the winter. Then all
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.000]  that moisture would thaw out in the springtime and then it would germinate
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.800]  those seeds. All that warmth and that water would tell those seeds, hey it's
[12:03.800 --> 12:06.200]  time to go. And they would start sprouting up and then you'd repeat that
[12:06.200 --> 12:09.440]  cycle. It would veg out through the spring. Then it would get nice and tall
[12:09.440 --> 12:12.840]  like your plant here is in the backyard. And then about this time of year, it
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.760]  would start flowering out. So your plant is doing exactly what it should do. I
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.080]  think your plant looks pretty good. It's going to be taller than that block wall.
[12:21.080 --> 12:24.360]  I'm already warning you. If you're trying to hide it behind those other
[12:24.360 --> 12:27.520]  plants that are there and that block wall, you're gonna have to start doing
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.000]  some tricks. You need to tie that thing down. Maybe get some string or some
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.800]  fishing line or something. Maybe something softer than that to attach it
[12:35.800 --> 12:39.920]  to the plant. Maybe like a couple of twisty ties, a bread tie, a fuzzy stick. Do
[12:39.920 --> 12:42.720]  a couple of things to attach it to the plant so it's not all pressure on one
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.240]  spot and not too tight. But tie it to the plant and then just bend it over like a
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.720]  fishing pole. Just bend that bitch over. Don't break it. Just bend it over. You'll
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.120]  know. You'll be able to feel when you're pulling too hard. Just bend it over until
[12:54.120 --> 12:57.720]  it's kind of arched over and then it'll start growing straight up again. But bend
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.640]  it over and then if you have to keep bending it, keep doing it because that
[13:00.640 --> 13:04.920]  plant is gonna get tall out there in the sunshine and it's got quite a ways to go.
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.960]  It's not gonna come down until probably Halloween. So you've got a long ways to
[13:09.960 --> 13:13.840]  grow that plant outdoors. But your question sounded like you were worried
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.760]  about it. Honestly that plant is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. So hey
[13:17.760 --> 13:20.600]  bro thank you for the great email. Thanks for the compliments. Don't worry
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.280]  we won't change the format and please keep the good pictures and emails coming.
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.480]  Alright this next email I thought was fun. I thought I'd read this one on the
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.040]  show. It says, Rasta Jeff please don't use my name on the air if you read. I won't
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.720]  do that. I'll be cool for you bro. Then he says, long time listener and cannabis
[13:37.720 --> 13:41.280]  enthusiast here. I love the show and I look forward to the new episodes
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.040]  Mondays and Thursdays of every week. Anyway I was looking into some clones in
[13:46.040 --> 13:50.600]  Colorado and I was wondering if you had any recommendations as far as nurseries
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.360]  go. I have a friend who loves Granddaddy Purple to help with his insomnia so a
[13:55.360 --> 13:58.600]  nursery that carries these would be great. Thanks for always putting out
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.360]  fantastic information and helping to educate people across the country. Stay
[14:03.360 --> 14:10.000]  ivory. Hey dude thank you for the compliments. He looks forward to the
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.880]  episodes. That means a lot to me that people are just looking forward to it.
[14:12.880 --> 14:18.280]  That means you're enjoying it. Means I'm not just rambling to the air. So this one
[14:18.280 --> 14:23.760]  kind of put a weird visual in my head. For some reason I envision somebody
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.720]  walking into like the Home Depot nursery area or like whatever Jeff's Grow Emporium
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.360]  if you want to go to the mom and pop type style shop and they walk in and the
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.080]  guy's like oh how you doing ma'am our Indica's are over here our Sativa's over
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.800]  here we've got our hybrids placed over here if you're looking for the head
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.440]  stash we've got that over here and our elite cuts are kept back here and
[14:46.440 --> 14:50.320]  somebody walks into this little fancy area. Dude I fucking wish it was like
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.400]  that. It is not like that at all. Finding clones in Colorado is not going to be as
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.720]  easy as you think it is. There are no nurseries like you speak of. You have to
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.600]  go to dispensaries and those dispensaries may have a tray or two of
[15:03.600 --> 15:07.800]  okay-looking clones that may be labeled properly and I know that sounds very
[15:07.920 --> 15:10.960]  cynical and that doesn't sound very positive and it may sound kind of
[15:10.960 --> 15:15.640]  discouraging but to tell you the truth I have purchased clones from dispensaries
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.840]  several times. I'll say ten times that's probably close to accurate and I'm gonna
[15:20.840 --> 15:26.160]  say six out of ten times those plants were not labeled accurately. Back in the
[15:26.160 --> 15:30.000]  day I went to a dispensary that no longer exists. They used to carry a
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.280]  strain that was really hyped at the time it was brand new it was when medical
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.840]  marijuana was just getting super popular and all these hype strains were really
[15:36.840 --> 15:39.440]  coming out. This strain was featured in high times it was in several of their
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.920]  magazines. This dispensary only offered small batches of it. They had a batch
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.440]  that was supposed to drop on my birthday. The dispensary was two hours from my
[15:48.440 --> 15:51.880]  house I went up there. They were some I called them the night before I was like
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.440]  I would like to buy the limit of this strain that you sell and I would like to
[15:55.440 --> 15:58.560]  buy the limit of clones that I can purchase and they're like sure we'll do
[15:58.560 --> 16:02.040]  that for you come on in. So I showed up at this dispensary when they're supposed
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.000]  to open. It started snowing that morning so not a big deal but I had to drive to
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.920]  Denver in the snow that was kind of a bitch then we get there. I realized it is
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.040]  daylight savings time it's the first day that the time moved forward so the
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.640]  dispensary opened an hour late. I sat in front of the dispensary in line with
[16:20.640 --> 16:23.160]  other people for an hour because they announced that they were getting this
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.480]  drop of this strain that would go on sale that day and it just happened to be
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.160]  my birthday. I called him I was like bro save me the limit the limit per customer
[16:30.160 --> 16:33.480]  was a quarter so they had a quarter of that saved for me I won't mention the
[16:33.480 --> 16:36.440]  strain I won't mention the dispensary because well that doesn't need to be
[16:36.440 --> 16:40.200]  said right now but they had a quarter they're supposed to have I think the
[16:40.200 --> 16:44.000]  limit that I could get was six clones so I get in there and I was like man I'm
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.640]  this guy called last night he goes oh yeah the notes right here I'm the one
[16:46.640 --> 16:49.920]  that talked to you but I sold all that strain last night I almost said the name
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.040]  of the strain. I was like bro I drove up here from Pueblo to get that bag for my
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.520]  birthday it's my birthday dude I came up here just to get that and you're
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.000]  supposed to have six clones for me too and he goes oh he didn't bring the
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.080]  clones yet and I was like so what am I up here for man and he's like I'll tell
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.520]  you what dude I'll go to the car and I will get you this is way back in the day
[17:09.520 --> 17:12.520]  you guys the rules are way different now he went to the car and got his head
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.560]  stash of this strain and brought it into the store and weighed me out seven grams
[17:16.560 --> 17:20.560]  for myself and sold it to me out of his bag because it was my birthday and he
[17:20.560 --> 17:23.200]  didn't want to fuck over the store's reputation because I shopped there quite
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.440]  frequently for it being so far away then he called his buddy to bring me the
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.680]  clones the clones arrived they were all in rapid routers they were barely
[17:31.680 --> 17:35.800]  rooting they kind of looked like shit he told me if I bought all six of them that
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.000]  he would only charge me for three since it was my birthday and that I'd kind of
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.640]  had a shitty experience and he made me sit in front of the dispensary for an
[17:41.640 --> 17:46.320]  hour so I got six clones for the price of three and I bought the bag of the
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.280]  hype strain that I'd been looking for I brought the plants home I pottered them
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.560]  I flowered them out and you guys there were three different fucking plants in
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.640]  that batch of clones and none of them were the strain that I paid for okay
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.160]  that dispensary was in Denver I went to another dispensary in Colorado Springs
[18:03.160 --> 18:08.440]  and I purchased what was supposed to be lemon og and blueberry they were selling
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.480]  this amazing lemon og flower it was delicious every time I would buy it it
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.040]  would be bright green buds with these bright orange highlights in it it was
[18:16.040 --> 18:20.120]  just frosty and it smelled like lemons it was amazing so I bought the clone I
[18:20.120 --> 18:23.200]  was like I can grow the shit out of that no matter how I grew it it wouldn't come
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.600]  out like that that was not the same clone they falsely advertised that that
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.800]  clone was that strain it was not they just wanted to sell more clones they
[18:30.800 --> 18:34.160]  probably had some shit they realized this sucks and they just wanted to clone
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.320]  it out and get rid of it and make a few bucks off of that plant so they just cut
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.080]  it stuck it in rapid rooters barely got it rooted and fucking sold it to people
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.560]  the blueberry they sold me was actually tremendous and I really loved that but
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.200]  that lemon thing they sold me was not what was advertised so that's two prime
[18:48.200 --> 18:52.920]  examples of being duped and sold clones that were not labeled properly and not
[18:52.920 --> 18:57.960]  what I expected and not what I paid for and also you can't just go looking for a
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.520]  specific strain they don't cut there's not a dispensary that just cuts a bunch
[19:01.520 --> 19:05.280]  of a certain strain to put out on the shelf to have them for customers that
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.440]  kind of that's counterintuitive for a dispensary they don't want you growing
[19:08.440 --> 19:11.880]  because they want you shopping and buying from them so they're not going to
[19:11.880 --> 19:15.600]  give you their head stash there are a few dispensaries at which you can
[19:15.600 --> 19:19.160]  purchase clones I don't know what they will have ever they don't know what
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.000]  they'll have you can't order them from them you can't make requests the grow
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.480]  will cut clones they will manifest it in a transfer to the store the store will
[19:26.480 --> 19:30.720]  receive it they'll put it on the shelves hopefully someone at the store will have
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.480]  some knowledge on how to take care of the clones I don't know where to send
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.400]  you because if I recommend a facility or a dispensary and you go there and you
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.640]  buy a clone and they give you some shit that's got mites on it or turns out to
[19:41.640 --> 19:45.040]  not be what it was labeled then I feel like it's partly on me because I
[19:45.040 --> 19:50.840]  recommended the place however I did buy a Durban poison clone from kind love
[19:50.840 --> 19:57.160]  several years ago and it was absolutely Durban poison it was absolutely bug free
[19:57.160 --> 20:03.800]  also I got a platinum OG clone from the clinic it was absolutely platinum OG and
[20:03.800 --> 20:08.480]  it was absolutely bug free but honestly not to bust your bubble dude it sounds
[20:08.480 --> 20:12.560]  like you're expecting something that doesn't really exist there is a place in
[20:12.560 --> 20:16.400]  Denver that advertises that they have a ton of clones available I drove there
[20:16.400 --> 20:19.160]  one time with a lot of money in my pocket and a couple of friends in the
[20:19.160 --> 20:22.800]  car because we're limited on how many plants we can buy we all knew the drill
[20:22.800 --> 20:26.040]  we were all gonna buy our limit they were all going to one garden this place
[20:26.040 --> 20:29.840]  had nothing but fucking spider mites powdery mildew and embarrassing clones
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.800]  available so I don't even want to say the name of their place I don't want to
[20:33.800 --> 20:37.200]  send you there to go fuck up your garden because that's basically what you'll be
[20:37.200 --> 20:41.360]  doing all right in this same email you mentioned that your friend loves grand
[20:41.480 --> 20:45.800]  daddy purple and you would love a granddaddy purple clone the GDP is
[20:45.800 --> 20:50.080]  readily available in seed form so what I would recommend is that you order some
[20:50.080 --> 20:53.480]  seeds I would check with dank seed store and see if they've got the granddaddy
[20:53.480 --> 20:57.960]  purple seeds available and get yourself a pack maybe two packs of those and grow
[20:57.960 --> 21:01.640]  them out grow out whatever your legal limit is if you're allowed six plants
[21:01.640 --> 21:07.280]  grow six dry them cure them then take samples to your friend label it GDP 1
[21:07.280 --> 21:10.720]  GDP 2 you know what I mean so that you know what he's smoking so that you know
[21:10.760 --> 21:15.080]  which each plan is so I guess grow it keep a clone of it then flower it out
[21:15.080 --> 21:19.000]  then let him smoke it and his favorite he'll have two favorites so be to that
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.520]  you got to narrow it down from keep those two and grow them again and then
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.120]  give him a blind test does this one or does this one work for you and then see
[21:26.120 --> 21:29.920]  which one works best and then you've got the best granddaddy purple phenotype
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.120]  from seed that is perfect for your friend that's what a good caregiver does
[21:34.120 --> 21:37.160]  that's what we do for patients that's some of the difference between just
[21:37.160 --> 21:40.360]  being a cash cropper and a commercial grower and being somebody that is
[21:40.360 --> 21:44.720]  growing to help somebody heal and improve the quality and enjoy their life
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.440]  a little bit better so I recommend getting some seeds bro and growing out
[21:48.440 --> 21:52.840]  some granddaddy purple seeds they are not hard to find my friend it will be
[21:52.840 --> 21:57.000]  easier to find than a clean granddaddy purple cut hey bro thanks for reaching
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.880]  out thanks for the great email and dude good job trying to take care of your
[21:59.880 --> 22:05.240]  friend I hope he is able to find some relief from his insomnia as he's smoking
[22:05.240 --> 22:09.600]  for insomnia is why he likes the GDP alright guys let's move on to the next
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.520]  email this next email comes from let's see they don't want their name said so
[22:15.520 --> 22:18.120]  we're just gonna get right into it it says hello Rasta Jeff longtime listener
[22:18.120 --> 22:22.400]  of the wonderful podcast writing from Prohibition Land in Indiana it would be
[22:22.400 --> 22:25.560]  careful out there it says thank you for all the great knowledge that you have
[22:25.560 --> 22:29.040]  given me you're very welcome please bring more grow talk I'm doing my best
[22:29.040 --> 22:33.520]  bro I got to get this equipment fixed and we'll get it going then he says I've
[22:33.520 --> 22:36.960]  recently started an indoor grow and I'm having some issues with a few of my
[22:36.960 --> 22:41.600]  plants the leaves old and new are starting to curl under and wilt not to
[22:41.600 --> 22:44.640]  the point where they're falling off and dying but they just don't look the
[22:44.640 --> 22:49.800]  happiest like I want then he describes this setup quite a bit then he says one
[22:49.800 --> 22:54.000]  thing I'm thinking may be the issue is when I adjust the pH the tap water seems
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.560]  like it takes a lot maybe six to nine mils of pH adjusting solution to get
[22:59.560 --> 23:05.920]  from 7.2 to 6.4 so maybe it could be my starting water quality I am letting it
[23:05.920 --> 23:10.680]  sit a few hours before using it if that matters my humidity stays between 50 and
[23:10.680 --> 23:15.840]  65 percent temps are between 78 and 80 degrees all of the plants are not
[23:15.840 --> 23:20.520]  affected only a few all leaves aren't affected only a few on the plants which
[23:20.520 --> 23:23.680]  are affected I've attached some pics which I have looked at we'll talk about
[23:23.680 --> 23:27.760]  them then he says what the strain is supposed to be I says he's growing in a
[23:27.760 --> 23:31.960]  10 by 10 room 600 watts of light it's got a nice setup he's describing the
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.000]  setup am I overlooking something should I not worry about it then he asked could
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  this be chlorine chloramine or other other toxicity from the tap water
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.920]  anything you can come up with could be helpful thank you so much and I've
[23:43.920 --> 23:48.820]  attached pics stay iry oh then he says you can't say my name from Adam hey Adam
[23:48.820 --> 23:52.800]  thank you for the great email men from looking at your pictures and from what
[23:52.800 --> 23:56.840]  you've said there are a couple things that get my attention first off I would
[23:56.840 --> 24:01.940]  calibrate my pH meter if I were you it sounds like that pH meter could be off I
[24:01.940 --> 24:04.220]  don't know what you've got I don't know if you're using drops I don't know if
[24:04.220 --> 24:07.340]  you've got a blue lab I don't know if you've got a Milwaukee I would calibrate
[24:07.340 --> 24:11.740]  it that would be the first thing I do if you can't calibrate it yourself maybe if
[24:11.740 --> 24:14.660]  you take it to the grow shop I know my local grow shop they'd be happy to help
[24:14.660 --> 24:17.340]  you out so if you just take the pin to the grow store and be like hey can you
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.620]  guys show me how to calibrate this or maybe they can check it for you and they
[24:20.620 --> 24:23.260]  can say oh dude you've been so far off and that's why it's taken so much to
[24:23.260 --> 24:28.420]  adjust honestly I don't know how much water you're adjusting you said I take
[24:28.420 --> 24:31.540]  six to nine mils I've been in a facility where it took an ounce to
[24:31.540 --> 24:35.620]  adjust our pH to the proper solution because we were using so much water to
[24:35.620 --> 24:40.060]  start with so it I'm not sure how much that doesn't sound too too crazy to me
[24:40.060 --> 24:44.420]  six to nine mils doesn't sound like a lot to move it a few points also from
[24:44.420 --> 24:48.380]  looking at your plants it could be a pH issue it does kind of look like they're
[24:48.380 --> 24:53.180]  stuck there's something and not getting fed and something is stuck also from
[24:53.180 --> 24:56.780]  looking at the plants it looks like they are a little bit possibly over watered
[24:56.780 --> 25:00.140]  that's what the leaves do when they're over watered they curl down and they
[25:00.140 --> 25:04.700]  start to make what I call the claw the handy claw they're just squeezing there
[25:04.700 --> 25:09.680]  look like they're angry they kind of have that so it could be pH it could be
[25:09.680 --> 25:13.100]  an over watering which could be coming together if you're over watering it's
[25:13.100 --> 25:16.140]  gonna disrupt your pH it's gonna really throw off everything there in the root
[25:16.140 --> 25:21.980]  zone also the leaves have a leathery tough
[25:22.140 --> 25:27.900]  wrinkled look to them I'm going to say that you should listen to the episode
[25:27.900 --> 25:32.540]  about vapor pressure deficit it looks like those leaves are possibly a little
[25:32.540 --> 25:38.940]  crispy a little dry like the air around those specific plants is too dry I want
[25:38.940 --> 25:43.500]  to know are they getting over watered is your pH meter accurate and are these
[25:43.500 --> 25:47.340]  plants sitting right in front of the fan the plants that are getting problems are
[25:47.340 --> 25:51.060]  they near the fan is that where you've got some ventilation coming in is there
[25:51.060 --> 25:54.900]  different air right there that's what I think could be causing it so it's pH
[25:54.900 --> 26:00.340]  it's over water or it is extreme airflow disrupting the vapor pressure deficit
[26:00.340 --> 26:04.540]  right there around those leaves we're gonna have to do more research that's
[26:04.540 --> 26:06.820]  how cannabis works you're gonna have to figure out what you're gonna have to
[26:06.820 --> 26:10.780]  investigate you're gonna have to dial it in a little bit and see what is going on
[26:10.780 --> 26:14.280]  hey I really do appreciate the great email Adam I hope we solved some
[26:14.280 --> 26:18.180]  problems thanks for listening to the show I look forward to some feedback I
[26:18.180 --> 26:21.900]  look forward to more pictures and I hope we're able to get your garden back
[26:21.900 --> 26:25.500]  up to speed honestly dude most of the garden looks pretty good if you've only
[26:25.500 --> 26:29.620]  got a few leaves like that you're okay but if it starts spreading and going
[26:29.620 --> 26:32.340]  rampant we're gonna have to figure out what's causing that and we're gonna have
[26:32.340 --> 26:36.460]  to fix it and correct it very quickly so keep me updated keep me posted
[26:36.460 --> 26:41.740]  hopefully we can get your garden back up to a plus condition all right you guys I
[26:41.740 --> 26:44.980]  think that is enough emails for this episode if you've sent me an email
[26:44.980 --> 26:48.380]  recently or in a long time and I haven't read it don't worry I've got a
[26:48.380 --> 26:52.060]  pile of emails printed out I haven't been doing messages on the show for a
[26:52.060 --> 26:55.820]  while but I will get back to it and I will work my way through this stack of
[26:55.820 --> 26:59.300]  emails please be patient and keep the emails coming don't be shy the email
[26:59.300 --> 27:03.220]  address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com I love the interaction and I
[27:03.220 --> 27:07.620]  would love to hear from you please send me all of your grow questions and I will
[27:07.620 --> 27:11.820]  get to them it just may take me a little bit all right real quick I want to throw
[27:11.820 --> 27:17.780]  out some quick shoutouts to Jade, Angel, Aldridge, and Tanner M. You guys before I
[27:17.780 --> 27:21.060]  start wrapping up this episode I've got one more thing I want to rant about I
[27:21.060 --> 27:23.780]  was at a friend's garden the other day I was kind of helping him do some things
[27:23.780 --> 27:26.860]  kind of teaching him some tricks and tips trying to get his garden up to
[27:26.860 --> 27:30.580]  speed and he was mixing up his nutrients and he simply picked up the bottle off
[27:30.580 --> 27:33.780]  the shelf and he picked up the little measuring device that he pours it into
[27:33.780 --> 27:36.420]  and he measured how many mils he needed in there and then he threw it right into
[27:36.420 --> 27:40.460]  the gallon or the five gallon bucket of water and then he just did the next one
[27:40.460 --> 27:45.180]  the same way and I was like bro shake the bottles man he's like what and I was
[27:45.180 --> 27:48.100]  like dude think about it all the good stuff is in the bottom of that bottle
[27:48.100 --> 27:51.340]  all the heavy stuff that we're paying for all the stuff the plants want to eat
[27:51.340 --> 27:54.620]  that's probably sinking right to the bottom of your nutrients so if you've
[27:54.620 --> 27:58.420]  got a bottle whatever it is if it's your grow your micro your bloom whatever
[27:58.420 --> 28:02.220]  solution you've got there shake that bottle up before you pour it out because
[28:02.220 --> 28:05.700]  there's a lot of water in there that things like 90% water you want to at
[28:05.700 --> 28:09.020]  least spread those inert ingredients out right you don't just want to give it the
[28:09.020 --> 28:11.980]  top little water to where at the end of the crop you're feeding it all the
[28:11.980 --> 28:15.340]  chunks have you ever finished a bottle of nutrients and then just had a bunch
[28:15.340 --> 28:19.940]  of chunky funky salty shit in the bottom of it that's probably because you weren't
[28:19.940 --> 28:25.740]  shaking it hard enough or enough often enough before you were using it when you
[28:25.740 --> 28:29.660]  were mixing up your nutrient solutions and all the salts just stayed in the
[28:29.660 --> 28:33.180]  bottom you just poured out the water and he fed your plants 30 mils of mostly
[28:33.180 --> 28:38.900]  water instead of 30 mils of NPK so shake those nutrient bottles before you pour
[28:38.900 --> 28:43.020]  it into your measuring device and then as you're pouring the nutrients into the
[28:43.020 --> 28:47.140]  water I would just pour one in there and then give it a little stir and then pour
[28:47.140 --> 28:50.700]  the next one don't pour them to where they touch without being diluted by a
[28:50.700 --> 28:54.700]  bunch of water the nutrients are sold in two different containers for a reason
[28:54.700 --> 28:59.860]  try not to let them mix until they hit a larger container of water you don't want
[28:59.860 --> 29:05.020]  the two concentrated bottles those two products touching they will bond there's
[29:05.020 --> 29:08.420]  a reason why they're sold separately just shake them and then pour them in
[29:08.420 --> 29:11.380]  separately that's my advice you guys all right let's start wrapping up this
[29:11.380 --> 29:14.780]  podcast don't forget to check out my friends at the hella dank seed company
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.500]  at dank seed store I would appreciate it if you find me on all of the social

[29:43.580 --> 29:46.940]  but I've got to get the equipment dialed in and I think it worked for this whole
[29:46.940 --> 29:50.900]  show we'll find out as I edit so I'll be back to the grow lessons really soon
[29:50.900 --> 29:55.180]  thanks for hanging in with me I want to give a huge shout out to TW glass and
