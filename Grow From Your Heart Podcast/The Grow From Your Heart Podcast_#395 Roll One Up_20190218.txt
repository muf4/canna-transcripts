[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  This is Doug Benson and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:09.200 --> 00:14.320]  Welcome back, Cannabis World. It is time for episode 395 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:14.320 --> 00:18.480]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds. That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds. If you
[00:18.480 --> 00:23.280]  need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds and you can find them at
[00:23.360 --> 00:31.200]  www.oregoneliteseeds.com. You know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.880]  smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Gelato Cake Batter. This is from our friends at Apothecary
[00:36.880 --> 00:45.920]  Farms. The label says it is 62.2% THC and 73.4% total cannabinoids. This stuff tastes delicious.
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.920]  It has a really unique, funky aroma. I can't find the right words to describe it. It is gross,
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.560]  funky, sweet, spicy, sour, and delicious all at the same time. I really can't get enough of the
[00:58.560 --> 01:05.200]  Gelato Cake Batter. The aroma is remarkable. The flavor is incredible. The buzz is beautiful. It's
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.640]  got me nice and high. It's got my eyes droopy. I've got the best cotton mouth right now. It is
[01:10.640 --> 01:16.960]  delicious. Big shout out to all my friends at Apothecary Farms. Thank you for the great Gelato
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.760]  Cake Batter. All right, Podcast World. If you've been following along, you know that I've been
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.920]  doing a long series of grow lessons. In a previous episode, I mentioned that those lessons were over.
[01:27.920 --> 01:34.720]  Well, I was wrong. Since that time, I realized I left out a very crucial part of our grow experience.
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.840]  We started off by making a solid plan for our grow. We thought out our equipment. We thought
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.120]  out our space very well. We thought out our genetics. Hopefully, we successfully ran a full
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.400]  garden cycle. We have harvested. We have dried and cured that product. We've got some beautifully
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.920]  trimmed up buds. You know the one thing I left out? We never smoked this product. This episode
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.360]  is going to be the smoke that shit episode. We've ran a full garden. Let's reward ourselves and
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.560]  enjoy our finished product. There's really nothing like smoking your own product. Any flowers that
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.520]  you've grown, harvested, trimmed, you spent a bunch of time with it, you've really got some
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.400]  attachment to it. There's really a rewarding feeling that comes with smoking a crop that you
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.520]  grew. I've been growing for quite a while. I've grown many, many small personal crops. I have
[02:19.520 --> 02:25.120]  grown many large commercial crops. I have done a lot of pheno hunts of plants that I have bred.
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.040]  I have grown a lot of plants. It is still very exciting to me to get to try the first little
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.560]  batch of smoke from each crop that I grow. There's something very rewarding and very satisfying and
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.800]  very fun. It feels like a kid inside. It's like a kid on Christmas morning. I get to try my new
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.280]  thing. Let's see what it's like. I spent all this time with it and I finally get to enjoy it.
[02:45.280 --> 02:50.320]  Every time I do it, especially something that I've just bred and it's his first run with it.
[02:50.320 --> 02:54.400]  I bred something. I made some seeds. I grew those seeds out. I pheno hunted those seeds.
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.440]  Now I finally have a finished product. That is real satisfaction to me. There's nothing like
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.880]  that feeling. This may be your first time getting to enjoy this experience. I want this to be a
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.800]  great experience for you. I want every harvest to be a wonderful experience for you. There's one
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.320]  thing that can really ruin your experience when it comes to testing your cannabis for the first time.
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.280]  The one thing that can really fuck it up is by being impatient. If you cut down your plants too
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.560]  early, they aren't going to be the quality you deserve. If you dried and cured your plants in
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.160]  a rushing manner, you are not going to get the quality that you deserve. So make sure those
[03:32.160 --> 03:37.120]  plants got to finish. Make sure your plants were flushed. Make sure they were harvested,
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.440]  dried, and cured and trimmed correctly. Let's not try to smoke our first crop too early and put a
[03:43.440 --> 03:48.080]  bad taste in our mouth, literally, about our new crop. You're going to take a bud, you're going to
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.680]  dry it fast, you're going to try to smoke it, it's going to taste like shit, and you're going to feel
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.520]  like shit about your whole crop. You're going to have just a bad feeling about it. You spent all
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.600]  this time, be patient, let each bud be ready before you smoke them. So the first thing we need to test
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.880]  before we get down to smoking this product is, is it ready? Is it dry enough? Have you dried and
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.080]  cured this product properly before we go putting it in a grinder and try to roll it up or put it
[04:12.080 --> 04:19.280]  in a pipe? It is acceptable for cured herb to be kind of sticky and a little bit moist. That is the
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.080]  way a lot of people like it. You don't get a lot of that in the Colorado area because we have what
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.200]  is known as the Colorado crunch here. And I do plan to do a podcast all about the Colorado crunch
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.680]  in the future. But let's stay focused. Let's talk about your dried and cured herb before we smoke
[04:33.680 --> 04:39.440]  it. It may be a little spongy, it may be a little sticky. If you have cured it properly, that is okay.
[04:39.440 --> 04:44.400]  You may need to take a couple of nugs out of the jar and set them on the table for three, four,
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.800]  maybe five or six hours before you decide to smoke. It is not uncommon to see a connoisseur
[04:50.800 --> 04:56.640]  smoker pull out his jar of nugs, crack the lid, take out three or four nuggets, set them on the
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.680]  table, seal the jar up, put it back in his little stash spot, and then leave those nuggets on the
[05:01.680 --> 05:07.040]  table throughout the day. And that's what we smoke on as the day goes by. They may be a little bit
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.600]  damp as soon as we pull them out of the jar, but as the day goes on, they're going to dry out
[05:11.600 --> 05:18.880]  perfectly to roll a fat joint and pack a couple of bowls. So make sure your herb is cured and dry
[05:18.880 --> 05:24.880]  enough to burn properly so you don't disappoint yourself with your first experience. Now, if you're
[05:24.880 --> 05:29.920]  confident that your buds are dried and cured and ready for consumption, let's talk about taking that
[05:29.920 --> 05:36.720]  first taste test of our new crop. For me, testing a new product is sort of a combination between a
[05:36.720 --> 05:43.200]  science experiment and a ritual. I like to be in my environment. I like to use my equipment. I like
[05:43.200 --> 05:48.320]  to know what to expect. I like to take away variables. That way I can see what the actual
[05:48.320 --> 05:53.360]  product is telling me. Now, I know that may sound weird to some people, but a lot of stoners are
[05:53.360 --> 05:59.120]  very ritualistic. And by ritualistic, I don't mean some fancy ceremony. I just mean I like to be in
[05:59.120 --> 06:03.760]  a certain place. I like to be right here. This is my comfortable smoking place. If you gave me a new
[06:03.760 --> 06:08.640]  concentrate, if you gave me some flour and you said, Hey, I want you to judge this or rate this,
[06:08.640 --> 06:14.320]  this would be the best place for me to conduct that experiment so that I could give you a proper
[06:14.320 --> 06:19.040]  review. This is where I'm comfortable. I know that the door is locked. I know I can consume safely
[06:19.040 --> 06:23.520]  here. I know that nobody can bother me here. I can control the environment here. I can control the
[06:23.520 --> 06:28.560]  music here. This is a great place for myself to consume any type of cannabis product. I'm
[06:28.560 --> 06:32.240]  comfortable here. Nothing could go wrong. There's a couch over there. There's a bed about 50 feet
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.480]  away. There are snacks in the fridge. I'm set up here. I'm really comfortable. Also, I've got my
[06:36.480 --> 06:39.920]  little chair. This is my zone. I got my drinks right here in front of me. I got the computer
[06:39.920 --> 06:45.280]  so I could browse the internet. I've got my next step in this talk is my equipment. I've got all
[06:45.280 --> 06:50.000]  my favorite smoking equipment just to the right of me. My favorite pipe is here. My favorite dab
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.280]  rig is here. All my tools to keep those things in proper smoking condition, they're all right here.
[06:55.280 --> 07:00.000]  So part of the ritual is being in the right place. You've probably got that little place. It's your
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.240]  little chair. It's that little spot on your bed. Everybody's got that one little cozy spot where
[07:04.240 --> 07:08.880]  they want to chill and smoke. So get in your little cozy place, get comfy, put on the music
[07:08.880 --> 07:14.240]  that you like, get the air the way you like it, be in your right place. Also get your favorite piece.
[07:14.240 --> 07:18.400]  Maybe you've got that favorite bong. Maybe you've got that favorite dab rig. Maybe you've got that
[07:18.400 --> 07:24.400]  favorite pipe. Find your favorite piece. Be in your comfort zone. Also, maybe there are certain
[07:24.400 --> 07:29.600]  people you do or don't like to smoke around. Do you want to smoke your crop for the first time
[07:29.600 --> 07:34.320]  by yourself or do you want to make it fun and bring your friends along and be like, bro, check
[07:34.320 --> 07:38.480]  out what I smoked. Let's try it together for the first time. It's always fun to have your friends
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.040]  around. Also, that puts you on the spot. Maybe you smoke it and it tastes like you just stuck
[07:43.040 --> 07:47.440]  your tongue in a light socket and everyone's going to get to smoke that with you and experience it.
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.440]  That's a learning experience. Just be honest. Go ahead and share it with your friends. See what
[07:51.440 --> 07:55.920]  everybody thinks. We're going to talk more about that reaction in just a minute. Another thing that
[07:55.920 --> 08:01.040]  is really fun to involve your friends in is if you do a pheno hunt. So if you grew five seeds,
[08:01.040 --> 08:05.360]  you've probably got five different phenotypes or maybe two or three different phenotypes to
[08:05.360 --> 08:10.960]  select from out of those five. It's always fun to load up five bowls or roll five joints and label
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.640]  them somehow right on the end of the filter. Write number one, number two, or just remember
[08:14.640 --> 08:19.040]  and then smoke them with your friends and see if you guys like plant number one, plant number two,
[08:19.040 --> 08:24.000]  plant number three better. See if different people in the room like number one or number three better.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.800]  Maybe everybody in the room says, bro, number five was amazing. That's always fun to bring your
[08:28.800 --> 08:34.240]  friends around to consume with you to see what you have just done. So do you want your first try,
[08:34.240 --> 08:38.160]  your ritual? Do you want that to happen with friends around or do you want that to be a little
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.280]  isolated situation? I could go both ways. In my little comfort zone right here, there are two
[08:43.280 --> 08:47.760]  chairs right in front of me where Mike is always invited. Kevin likes to take this spot right here.
[08:47.760 --> 08:51.440]  There are several other folks that come over and smoke. They're always invited. That's always fun
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.200]  to me. I've got a couple other chairs we can pull out if it gets crowded. I like to smoke with
[08:55.200 --> 08:58.800]  friends. I don't know if you want to smoke your first crop with friends. You may be timid. You
[08:58.800 --> 09:03.600]  may be shy. That may not be your thing, but think about that. Do you want some friends around?
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.520]  Another thing I recommend when you come to sampling your new product is make it your first
[09:09.520 --> 09:15.440]  smoke of the day. Don't smoke anything before that. Don't eat any edibles before that. Go in
[09:15.440 --> 09:21.680]  totally sober. Go in fresh so that you know exactly what your product has done to you.
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.120]  So let me back up a couple of steps. I've gotten ahead of myself. Let's start off
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.680]  by grinding up our product. Once you are in your comfortable spot with your people,
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.880]  with your music playing, with a drink on hand, and you're ready to rock,
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.800]  the first couple of things to consuming your new flowers are a visual inspection. Let's take a look
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.440]  at it. Let's look and see what we've done. Let's enjoy the beauty of this product. What colors do
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.400]  you see? Did you trim it well? Could you trim it better next time by looking at it? How do the
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.520]  trichomes look? Is that plant real frosty? Is it just kind of frosty? Give it a nice look. Enjoy
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.560]  it. Smell it. Hold it up to your face. Give it a nice smell. Enjoy that. It is yours. You put a
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.200]  lot of work into it. I think the next step is to give it a little bit of a squeeze. Yeah, you may
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.880]  break it up a little bit. That's fine. We're about to put this in a grinder and smoke it. We can
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.800]  destroy this, but it is yours. Enjoy it. So I'd give it a little squeeze. How moist is it? Do you
[10:12.800 --> 10:16.800]  think it's ready to smoke? Is that ready? Are you going to embarrass yourself by trying to put that
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.480]  in the pipe? Do you really need just another day or two of curing that? Or does it need to sit on
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.640]  the table for a couple of hours? Is it ready? This is your last chance before you grind it up in
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.360]  front of your friends. So make sure. How does it feel in your hand? Is it real sticky? Now that
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.440]  you've played with it a little bit, smell the inside of the bud. Smell your fingers. How does
[10:33.440 --> 10:39.280]  that smell? Try to absorb and enjoy all of this stuff, especially if it's your first crop. And
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.800]  if this is like your thousandth crop, slow down for a minute. Stop and smell the flowers. This is
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.360]  one of the most rewarding parts of the entire process. We've done a lot of work. Let's enjoy
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.680]  this stuff. Let's not think too much about how much did we harvest? What does it weigh? What is
[10:53.680 --> 10:59.360]  it worth? Let's enjoy the actual flowers that we have grown. Let's enjoy the effort we made that
[10:59.360 --> 11:05.600]  turned into a consumable product that is beautiful, that has a great aroma to it, that is a work of
[11:05.600 --> 11:12.320]  art and nature and science all put together that you did. Take a moment. Enjoy that shit. So smell
[11:12.320 --> 11:18.240]  it. Break it up. Smell your fingers. Now it is time to put it in a grinder. When you put it in
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.520]  the grinder and give it a couple of turns, if that grinder is really hard to spin, your buds may
[11:23.520 --> 11:28.480]  be too wet. When you open up that grinder, if it's a little moist in there, you'll be able to tell at
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.280]  this point. If that one bud is a little bit too wet, you still need to let the rest of the buds
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.560]  dry and cure just a little bit longer. Don't worry. You can dry them a little bit more and you will be
[11:38.560 --> 11:43.680]  just fine. Now, if you feel like the bud that you have ground up is ready to consume, let's talk
[11:43.680 --> 11:48.080]  about consuming it. How do you want to smoke it? What is your favorite way? I spoke earlier about
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.480]  your favorite piece. Are you going to roll a joint? Are you a joint kind of a person? Are you a bong
[11:52.480 --> 11:56.560]  kind of a person? Are you a pipe kind of a person? Are you going to throw it in the vaporizer? How do
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.200]  you want to do it? That is up to you. Please, please, you can do it however you want. It's your
[12:01.200 --> 12:06.480]  herb, but please, for me, don't wrap it up in a blunt wrap. You just spent so much time growing
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.960]  the most delicious herb. You dried it and cured it. Why are you going to wrap it up in a paper bag?
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.760]  I am all about smoking a fat joint, but I do not appreciate smoking a blunt. If you're going to
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.560]  roll it up, get yourself some good papers. Get something like some raws, some elements, something
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.840]  quality, but please, for this first test, please don't roll it up in a blunt. And since we're on
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.160]  this subject, if you're going to pack a bowl, clean your pipe. You've got some fresh herb. You've got
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.640]  your friends over. You want to impress yourself and your friends the best you can with this new
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.440]  herb, so clean your pipe. And if you're smoking through the bong, dude, clean the bong and change
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.600]  the bong water. You wouldn't believe how many places I go to smoke a bong load and the water
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.240]  looks like muck and I will not smoke a bowl. So just change the bong water, clean your piece,
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.240]  and everybody will enjoy it much more and it will make your product taste much better.
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.240]  We're trying to impress everybody, you guys, so let's do the best we can to make your product
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.640]  taste the best that it can. All right, so you ground up your herb. You've got a fat joint
[13:00.640 --> 13:06.080]  rolled. You've got a bong load packed. You've got a pipe loaded. Maybe you filled up the vaporizer.
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.520]  Maybe you've got a volcano bag going on. However you decided to do it, now it is time to take our
[13:11.520 --> 13:18.400]  first puff of our freshly dried and cured cannabis crop. Like I said earlier, I recommend this being
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.920]  your first puff of the day. That way you know exactly what your herb does to you. We have now
[13:23.920 --> 13:30.800]  come to my favorite part of the entire process. It is now time to smoke the first sample of our
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.640]  newly harvested crop. So if you rolled up a joint, now's the time to spark it up. If you packed up a
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.200]  bowl, now's the time to start taking a couple of puffs. If you've got the vaporizer going, now's
[13:41.200 --> 13:45.440]  the time to start taking a couple of pulls. Take a couple of pulls, a couple of draws, a couple of
[13:45.440 --> 13:50.000]  tokes off your new product and sit back for a couple of seconds and let it sit in and see what
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.640]  it does to you. I don't know how much you consume, but depending on your consumption level, you
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.960]  should probably be able to take two, three, maybe four good draws of whatever you're smoking on.
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.800]  If you're smoking a joint, maybe two or three good draws. If you're smoking a bowl, maybe two or
[14:02.800 --> 14:06.240]  three, maybe three or four good puffs off of that. If you're hitting the bong, hopefully you only need
[14:06.240 --> 14:11.200]  one or two good bong rips before you start feeling it. I find vaporizers to be unpredictable. I never
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.680]  know if I'm going to need one or six pulls off the vaporizer, but take as many as you're comfortable
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.640]  with, get a little buzz on and sit back for a couple of seconds and just see what happens.
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.000]  Are you stoned? Did you get mellow? Did you get low? Are you high? Did you get giggly and goofy?
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.120]  Are you paranoid? Do you have the munchies? How do you feel? Give it a couple of seconds. If you've
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.880]  got other friends in the room, start conversation. You guys will start talking about the product.
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.720]  You'll start talking about the herb. Somebody will mention the taste. Somebody will mention
[14:38.720 --> 14:44.720]  the aroma. Conversation will start. Pay attention to how your friends react to your herb. Make a
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.680]  mental note of what you think of the herb. Do you like it? Do you like the aroma? Do you like the
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.800]  flavor? Do you like the buzz that you've gotten from the way you've consumed it? Now, it may be
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.360]  time to take a couple of more puffs and go to the next level. Now, what do you think? Now that you've
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.920]  pushed it a little bit, how do you feel? Now, are you super stoned? Are you stuck to the couch? Are
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.560]  you flying off the couch and just hanging on for dear life? How's it making you feel? How's it
[15:08.560 --> 15:13.280]  acting to your friends? Are they lit? Are they bored? See how they're enjoying it? Pay attention
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.520]  to the words that they're saying and try to make a mental note of their review of your product.
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.640]  Now, let's talk about a few things to look for while you are smoking your first sample. Let's
[15:22.640 --> 15:28.320]  look for some things about the product to pay attention to. How does your product burn? Does
[15:28.320 --> 15:33.280]  it burn smoothly? Did it burn like a charcoal briquette? Or did it burn a nice white ash?
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.880]  If the ash that you knocked off the end of your joint or that chunk that you dumped out of your
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.120]  bowl at the end, if that was chunky and black, you may not have flushed your product long enough.
[15:41.120 --> 15:46.400]  You may want a longer flush time. Also, you may not have dried it properly. It may still be a
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.040]  little bit wet. If it's not burning properly, it could still be a little moist and it needs more
[15:51.040 --> 15:58.400]  dry time. So pay attention to how it burns. Also, how does it smoke? Is the smoke nice and smooth?
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.760]  Is that smoke thick and harsh? Does it hurt your throat? Does it make you cough? Or can you just
[16:03.760 --> 16:08.560]  toke on it all day and blow clouds and it doesn't bother your lungs and throat at all? Pay attention
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.000]  to that. You can make improvements in your next grow based on the quality of this product.
[16:14.560 --> 16:20.000]  How is the flavor? How is the aroma? Are those things on point? Because if the flavor and aroma
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.520]  and burn factor are not on point, you can absolutely correct those in your next grow.
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.720]  I was talking about paying attention to what your friends say because they are going to be honest
[16:30.720 --> 16:34.880]  with you. You're going to be very proud of your crop. You spent a lot of time on this. You're
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.360]  going to think it is the best herb you've ever smoked. That is a very natural thing for new
[16:39.360 --> 16:45.360]  growers to experience. Listen to your friends. They smoke a lot of herb also. They're going to
[16:45.360 --> 16:51.120]  have very influential feedback. Don't let their criticism hurt your feelings. You're going to
[16:51.120 --> 16:55.360]  take their compliments. When one of your friends says, bro, this shit smells so good. I can't
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.160]  believe you grew this. You're going to glow. When the other guy says, bro, this kind of burns my
[17:00.160 --> 17:06.240]  throat, you have to take that compliment just as strongly as you did or that criticism as strongly
[17:06.240 --> 17:12.080]  as you did that compliment. They both matter equally. Use the compliment as a driving force
[17:12.080 --> 17:17.680]  to move you forward. Use the criticism as a way to improve your crop next time. Don't be hurt when
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.440]  one of your friends says, bro, that weed burns my throat. That's because you did something wrong and
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.080]  you need to improve. He was honest with you because he's a good friend. I mentioned earlier
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.760]  that some of the things that you may need to improve that you'll notice right away are your
[17:29.760 --> 17:35.600]  flush. How is that product burning? Again, is it a dark chunk or is it a nice, white, clean ash?
[17:35.600 --> 17:39.840]  Does it burn all the way through the joint or do you need to keep relighting it? If it's burning
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.640]  real black and chunky and you need to keep relighting it, you probably need it to flush longer.
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.960]  If it just keeps going out but it's not burning real black, it may just be too wet and you need
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.880]  to dry and cure it a little bit longer. How was your cure process? Does the herb taste good?
[17:54.880 --> 18:01.360]  Does it smell good? Is it crunchy? Is it dry? Is it moist? Did you dry and cure it to your liking?
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.360]  Do your friends think you dried and cured it properly? What do you think? As long as you're
[18:05.360 --> 18:09.120]  happy, that's what matters as long as you are consuming it. If it's going to market,
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.200]  it's got to satisfy the market, so pay attention to what the market says.
[18:13.760 --> 18:20.080]  Also, how did you trim it? Are you satisfied with the trim? Are your clients satisfied with the trim?
[18:20.080 --> 18:26.000]  Maybe you can improve on the trim. A lot of new growers don't trim enough in my opinion. You could
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.960]  go a little bit harder on your trim job. Now that you are consuming the product and you can actually
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.440]  tell what type of buzz it gives you, do you think you should have flowered a little bit longer or
[18:35.520 --> 18:40.320]  do you think you should have flowered a little bit shorter? If you pay attention to the finished
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.040]  product and how things came out this time, if you took plenty of notes throughout the grow,
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.880]  you can look at your notes, you can look at your finished product and you can see things that you
[18:48.880 --> 18:54.080]  can improve for the next run, which will make you a better grower. So take all of those compliments
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.600]  and take all of that criticism and ball it all up into one big learning lesson and think of ways to
[18:59.600 --> 19:04.720]  improve your crop next time. Now the overall deciding factor on the quality of this product is
[19:04.720 --> 19:10.000]  how do you feel? Do you like it? Were you going for a low couch lock kind of a buzz or were you
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  going for a big psychedelic head spinning high and did you get what you were after?
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.400]  Do you think if you would have let that plant flower a little bit longer that you would have
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.400]  gotten better quality? Do you think maybe you would have gotten a fatter yield? Do you think
[19:22.400 --> 19:26.560]  maybe if you would have chopped it a little later that it may have started to diminish the flavor?
[19:26.560 --> 19:30.320]  Do you think if you would have cut it a little bit earlier that it would have been a little more
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.480]  head buzzy and a little bit racier? There are things to think about as you are testing the
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.040]  final product. Are you satisfied with your finished product is the bottom line. If you're
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.600]  satisfied, don't change a thing. If there are things that you're not satisfied with,
[19:43.600 --> 19:49.040]  look at your notes and think of ways that you can improve those things for your next run.
[19:49.040 --> 19:54.080]  Now I started off our little science experiment slash ritual of testing our first crop by sitting
[19:54.080 --> 19:59.760]  in our little comfortable environment. Cannabis consumers, stoners, potheads, whatever you want
[19:59.760 --> 20:05.280]  to call us, I'm okay with all of the above. We have this tendency to smoke and get trapped in
[20:05.280 --> 20:08.560]  our little spot. We don't want to go anywhere. We're nice and comfortable here. Like I said
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.960]  earlier, the music is just right. The air conditioner is just right. The fridge is full
[20:12.960 --> 20:17.840]  of snacks. My bros are right here at the table. Why would I want to go anywhere? Why? Because
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.640]  when you step out of this little comfort zone, you may be twice as stoned as you even noticed.
[20:22.640 --> 20:28.400]  It's really easy to smoke a whole bunch of product and sit here and be blazed out of your mind to be
[20:28.400 --> 20:32.320]  comfortable because this is the zone. You know where everything is. I know there's a drink right
[20:32.320 --> 20:36.000]  here. I know the dab rig is right here. I know the pen is right here. I know where everything is.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  There's no chaos right here. Maybe go somewhere. Go for a walk. Maybe call an Uber and have them
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.400]  take you to the mall or to the park. Just go somewhere. Just get out of the house. Maybe just
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.880]  go get some food somewhere with your bros and just get out of the house while you're freshly buzzed
[20:50.880 --> 20:55.200]  on that fresh new product and see what kind of brand new experiences the world brings to you out
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.160]  there. There's this thing about stoners that once you smoke, you've got about 10 minutes. If you
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.520]  don't get up and leave in 10 minutes, you're fucking stuck wherever you just smoked. So
[21:04.080 --> 21:08.080]  smoke a little bit. If you're comfortable just hanging out at the house, do that. See what you
[21:08.080 --> 21:13.040]  experience. But next time, take a few puffs of that new product, call an Uber, and go somewhere
[21:13.040 --> 21:17.680]  exciting and see what life brings you. You may get into some cool new adventures. All right,
[21:17.680 --> 21:23.040]  podcast world, that is my talk about sampling and trying our freshly harvested cannabis crop. I hope
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.680]  you had as much fun as I did. I hope you learned something. If you found this episode educational,
[21:27.680 --> 21:31.680]  informative, or entertaining, and you would like to make a financial contribution to the show,

[21:41.040 --> 21:45.920]  the screen. Just so you know, I use the funding from Patreon for things like keeping the website
[21:45.920 --> 21:51.840]  alive. I do host a website, iRegeneticsColorado.com is my website. That is where the podcast is hosted.
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.920]  That's how I'm able to keep the podcast coming to you for free. It does cost me a little bit
[21:55.920 --> 22:01.120]  of money to host the website every year. So I do pay for that out of the Patreon contributions.
[22:01.120 --> 22:06.560]  I also used last year's Patreon contributions to fund the MacBook that I am using to record the
[22:06.560 --> 22:11.440]  show on right now. I also use some of the Patreon funding for little microphone covers and for
[22:11.440 --> 22:15.360]  equipment that breaks occasionally. I've had to replace this headphone amp a couple of times.
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.920]  I buy memory cards and things like that with the funding from Patreon. So it mainly pays
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.560]  for the podcast and the equipment and the little microphone covers. So I want to thank you guys
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.920]  for contributing to Patreon. And I look forward to all of the future support. I would also appreciate
