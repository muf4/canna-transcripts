[00:00.000 --> 00:01.560]  Hey, welcome to the show.
[00:01.560 --> 00:05.400]  It's time for episode 415 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.400 --> 00:09.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.040]  It is time to add fresh genetics to your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[00:14.040 --> 00:20.040]  and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.040 --> 00:23.880]  Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds on 420, because we are dropping the brand
[00:23.880 --> 00:30.440]  new Blue Raspberry Truffle from Irie Genetics on 420 at Oregon Elite Seeds, so be sure to
[00:30.440 --> 00:31.440]  check them out.
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.260]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:36.260 --> 00:40.580]  I am still taking dabs of this Lemon Gee batter from Apothecary Farms.
[00:40.580 --> 00:46.840]  The label says it has 68.5% THC with 79.1% total cannabinoids.
[00:46.840 --> 00:51.960]  Again, this concentrate smells deliciously disgusting, and I can't get enough of it.
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.440]  It gives me a tremendous head buzz, and it is great podcasting concentrate.
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.280]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails and answer a few questions,
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.280]  but before we get there, I want to do a couple of shout-outs for my Patreon supporters.
[01:06.280 --> 01:09.080]  I want to give a big shout-out to my friend Brett Gorman.
[01:09.080 --> 01:11.440]  I owe a huge shout-out to my friend Keith Klump.
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.280]  How about a big shout-out to Matthew Kate Wellman?
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.300]  Of course, a big shout-out to Riley Hansen, and always a big shout-out to my friend Sam.
[01:19.300 --> 01:22.380]  Big thanks to everybody for all of the Patreon support.
[01:22.380 --> 01:27.860]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, all you need to do is go to patreon.com
[01:27.860 --> 01:29.820]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:29.820 --> 01:33.820]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[01:33.820 --> 01:37.660]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I said I had a few emails to read.
[01:37.660 --> 01:39.820]  Let's get right into it.
[01:39.820 --> 01:44.980]  This first email comes to us from our friend Glenn G. in Oklahoma, and the email goes a
[01:44.980 --> 01:46.700]  lot like this.
[01:46.700 --> 01:48.820]  I will keep this short and to the point.
[01:48.860 --> 01:52.860]  I am a long-time pro-cannabis activist who lives in Oklahoma.
[01:52.860 --> 01:54.900]  Eleven years ago, my son was born.
[01:54.900 --> 01:58.860]  At the age of four, he was diagnosed with severe autism.
[01:58.860 --> 02:04.380]  Three years ago, my wife and I finally got frustrated enough with bullshit pharmaceuticals.
[02:04.380 --> 02:05.740]  We saw no improvements.
[02:05.740 --> 02:08.380]  The only thing that changed were his meltdowns.
[02:08.380 --> 02:10.340]  They got way fucking worse.
[02:10.340 --> 02:12.820]  So the pharmaceuticals weren't helping at all, it appears.
[02:12.820 --> 02:16.660]  They were making your child worse, which is totally not desirable.
[02:16.660 --> 02:21.020]  So we kicked those lame fuckers to the curb and did our own research.
[02:21.020 --> 02:25.780]  We would make multiple trips each year to Colorado to pick up cannabis, and recently
[02:25.780 --> 02:28.020]  we have started growing for ourselves.
[02:28.020 --> 02:29.020]  Congratulations.
[02:29.020 --> 02:34.420]  I am very proud of you for taking on the task of growing the cannabis for your son.
[02:34.420 --> 02:36.820]  I'm proud of you for that, and I'm glad to be able to help you.
[02:36.820 --> 02:37.820]  The email continues.
[02:37.820 --> 02:42.500]  It says, I am a tremendously passionate person in all that I do, especially with growing
[02:42.500 --> 02:44.900]  my son's medicine.
[02:44.900 --> 02:50.460]  Your show, your perspective, and your attitude, along with the content you provide, are priceless.
[02:50.460 --> 02:51.940]  Thank you for being there, man.
[02:51.940 --> 02:57.180]  Between you, the DGC, and Mr. Canuck's Grow Show, I don't know what the fuck else is going
[02:57.180 --> 03:02.660]  on in the world outside my family, friends, and employees, and I don't really mind at
[03:02.660 --> 03:03.660]  all.
[03:03.660 --> 03:05.460]  Hey, man, you are welcome.
[03:05.460 --> 03:06.580]  I speak for all of us.
[03:06.580 --> 03:08.500]  We are glad to be there for you.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.780]  It is our pleasure.
[03:09.780 --> 03:14.060]  It is an honor to know that we are providing you with the knowledge, the information, and
[03:14.220 --> 03:19.060]  the skills to be able to grow quality medicine for your son.
[03:19.060 --> 03:20.260]  That means a lot to myself.
[03:20.260 --> 03:25.460]  I'm sure that that means a lot to the DGC, and I'm sure that means a lot to Mr. Canuck,
[03:25.460 --> 03:29.380]  that we are helping your child enjoy life a little better, which is making the entire
[03:29.380 --> 03:32.100]  family enjoy life a little bit better.
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.900]  It is our pleasure, and it is an honor to be able to help you in any way that we can.
[03:36.900 --> 03:40.500]  I'm just here talking into a microphone, sharing the things that I have learned.
[03:40.500 --> 03:44.540]  You're actually taking that knowledge and that information, and you're doing something
[03:44.540 --> 03:45.540]  with it.
[03:45.540 --> 03:47.220]  So big kudos to you.
[03:47.220 --> 03:52.520]  Big respect to you for actually having the heart to get up and figure out what it takes
[03:52.520 --> 03:55.820]  to help your son, and then put it together and make it happen for him.
[03:55.820 --> 03:57.740]  That is commendable and respectable.
[03:57.740 --> 04:00.020]  So big shout out to you for that.
[04:00.020 --> 04:01.020]  Thank you.
[04:01.020 --> 04:02.020]  It goes both ways.
[04:02.020 --> 04:04.740]  I'm giving you the knowledge, and you are using it, so it is working beautifully.
[04:04.740 --> 04:06.040]  I'm proud of you.
[04:06.040 --> 04:07.040]  Thank you for that.
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.260]  Let's continue on with the message because there is a lot more to this.
[04:09.260 --> 04:14.460]  It says, My son's learning and development have been growing in leaps and bounds.
[04:14.460 --> 04:16.580]  I'm obviously not dabbing with him.
[04:16.580 --> 04:19.780]  We bought him an infuser, and we make our own tinctures.
[04:19.780 --> 04:23.780]  These things combined have got me feeling iry as fuck.
[04:23.780 --> 04:27.300]  We will be picking up some of your genetics as soon as possible.
[04:27.300 --> 04:28.380]  Thanks again, brother.
[04:28.380 --> 04:29.780]  Feel free to use my name.
[04:29.780 --> 04:32.860]  Glenn G. N. Oklahoma.
[04:32.860 --> 04:37.020]  Now the big part to take away from that is, he said, In the past, they had enough with
[04:37.020 --> 04:39.620]  bullshit pharmaceuticals, no improvements.
[04:39.620 --> 04:43.060]  It only made his son's meltdowns worse.
[04:43.060 --> 04:47.860]  Now he is using cannabis, and he is improving in leaps and bounds.
[04:47.860 --> 04:50.020]  That is the part to notice in this message.
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.020]  That is amazing.
[04:51.020 --> 04:52.860]  Glenn, I am proud of you.
[04:52.860 --> 04:55.980]  If I can do anything for your family, for your son, you let me know.
[04:55.980 --> 04:59.780]  You say here that you would like to get some iry genetics as soon as possible.
[04:59.780 --> 05:00.780]  Send me another email.
[05:00.780 --> 05:02.680]  We will get you set up with something.
[05:02.680 --> 05:06.500]  You tell me what kind of medicine works best for your son, and I will see what in the iry
[05:06.980 --> 05:09.060]  genetics lineup will fit that description.
[05:09.060 --> 05:10.680]  We will get you some seeds for your garden.
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.100]  We will get your son very well taken care of.
[05:13.100 --> 05:17.500]  It would be my pleasure, and it would be an honor to have my plants in the garden that
[05:17.500 --> 05:19.500]  is helping out your son.
[05:19.500 --> 05:22.460]  So Glenn and Oklahoma, big thank you for this great email.
[05:22.460 --> 05:24.700]  Most of the time we get questions and people need help.
[05:24.700 --> 05:29.420]  It is great to have somebody reach out and say that my advice and my guidance has improved
[05:29.420 --> 05:31.180]  the quality of their life.
[05:31.180 --> 05:35.180]  Multiple people are enjoying their lives because of the guidance I have given you, and it means
[05:35.180 --> 05:36.180]  a lot to me.
[05:36.380 --> 05:39.620]  Thank you for this great message, and I look forward to hearing from you so that we can
[05:39.620 --> 05:41.740]  get you some new beans in your garden.
[05:41.740 --> 05:43.500]  All right, I want to keep it moving.
[05:43.500 --> 05:46.420]  This next email comes from, let's see, do they say their name?
[05:46.420 --> 05:48.260]  Do they want us to say their name?
[05:48.260 --> 05:49.420]  Let's call them Andrew.
[05:49.420 --> 05:50.660]  That sounds good enough.
[05:50.660 --> 05:52.020]  This one comes from our friend Andrew.
[05:52.020 --> 05:55.420]  It says, Ross to Jeff, first off, I love the podcast.
[05:55.420 --> 05:59.260]  I'm on my third grow, and I've been listening to your podcast since before the first.
[05:59.260 --> 06:03.540]  I'm quickly working my way back through all the old episodes, so you may have to up it
[06:03.540 --> 06:05.500]  to three episodes a week.
[06:05.820 --> 06:09.820]  Hey, this week, you may get spoiled, but I cannot promise that every week.
[06:09.820 --> 06:12.180]  And also, dude, thanks for listening to all the old episodes.
[06:12.180 --> 06:15.620]  I keep saying it's a little bit embarrassing when people go back and listen to that old
[06:15.620 --> 06:19.500]  stuff, but also I love that you're listening to the old content and catching up.
[06:19.500 --> 06:24.060]  I feel like I am much more comfortable on a microphone and a much better podcaster at
[06:24.060 --> 06:26.940]  this time, but hey, I had to start somewhere.
[06:26.940 --> 06:29.940]  So thanks for listening, and I'm glad that you've been listening for so long.
[06:29.940 --> 06:34.380]  I'm going to continue with the message because that lemon G makes me ramble.
[06:34.380 --> 06:39.060]  It says, anyways, I think my question is probably one that no one bothers to ask.
[06:39.060 --> 06:41.300]  How can I keep plants small?
[06:41.300 --> 06:43.900]  Then he says, let me explain.
[06:43.900 --> 06:45.620]  My friend is starting his first grow.
[06:45.620 --> 06:49.220]  He read something online about putting seeds in a cup of water overnight to see if they
[06:49.220 --> 06:52.140]  were viable, but if the seed floated or not.
[06:52.140 --> 06:56.740]  I'm not sure if there's any truth to that, but all 20 of his feminize seeds germinated.
[06:56.740 --> 07:00.540]  He was super quickly in over his head with seedling, so he gave me half.
[07:00.540 --> 07:05.020]  I had them in beer cups and then repotted them into six inch pots, but they're outgrowing
[07:05.020 --> 07:06.020]  those quickly.
[07:06.020 --> 07:08.660]  Yes, they will grow quite quickly.
[07:08.660 --> 07:12.260]  Let's talk about that seed thing before we get too far here.
[07:12.260 --> 07:16.780]  The floaters and the sinkers, I have found that good seeds will flow and good seeds will
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.780]  sink.
[07:17.780 --> 07:19.820]  So I don't find that to be true in my experience.
[07:19.820 --> 07:21.500]  I've had seeds that float germinate.
[07:21.500 --> 07:23.260]  I've had seeds that sink germinate.
[07:23.260 --> 07:25.500]  So that is not a good judge of it.
[07:25.500 --> 07:27.340]  All 20 of them germinated.
[07:27.340 --> 07:29.340]  Congratulations on purchasing good seeds.
[07:29.340 --> 07:31.740]  However you got those, that breeder did a good job.
[07:31.740 --> 07:33.540]  You got 20 seeds to crack.
[07:33.540 --> 07:34.540]  Good work there.
[07:34.540 --> 07:36.700]  Then you're in quickly over your head.
[07:36.700 --> 07:40.180]  Yes, you guys, when you were planting seeds, you have to plan on them cracking.
[07:40.180 --> 07:41.300]  That's what is supposed to happen.
[07:41.300 --> 07:44.940]  So you got success and it fucked you all up because you didn't plan properly.
[07:44.940 --> 07:47.580]  Quickly in over your head is a common thing.
[07:47.580 --> 07:49.220]  You've got half of them, they're in beer cups.
[07:49.220 --> 07:50.780]  They went into six inch net pots.
[07:50.780 --> 07:53.820]  That sounds great, but they're outgrowing those quite quickly.
[07:53.820 --> 07:57.460]  Yes, if you've got them under enough light or maybe not even enough light, they will
[07:57.460 --> 08:00.900]  still outgrow those six inch net pots quite quickly.
[08:00.900 --> 08:02.980]  You say, I want to have an outdoor garden this year.
[08:02.980 --> 08:07.180]  So I'm hoping to keep these alive and healthy yet small enough to handle and keep in my
[08:07.180 --> 08:12.940]  two by four grow tents until outdoor season in Massachusetts, which is in May.
[08:12.940 --> 08:16.980]  So you've got all of April and we're working our way into May.
[08:16.980 --> 08:18.060]  You've got a little ways to go.
[08:18.060 --> 08:19.420]  This is going to be a real struggle.
[08:19.420 --> 08:23.020]  You say I'm worried about letting them get root bound and choking themselves and about
[08:23.020 --> 08:26.420]  them getting too leggy instead of bushy as they crowd each other.
[08:26.420 --> 08:28.500]  Yes, that is what is going to happen.
[08:28.500 --> 08:30.540]  You've got them in those small six inch net pots.
[08:30.540 --> 08:32.300]  They won't get root bound in there.
[08:32.300 --> 08:36.500]  The net pots allow a lot of air, but they won't be able to develop a real large root
[08:36.500 --> 08:39.340]  ball like they want to support a big fat plant.
[08:39.340 --> 08:42.780]  So that is going to cause you a little bit of slowed growth, especially when you take
[08:42.780 --> 08:43.780]  them outside.
[08:43.780 --> 08:45.100]  They need to be in bigger pots.
[08:45.100 --> 08:47.300]  That is one of the first things I'm going to talk about.
[08:47.300 --> 08:51.180]  They need to go into bigger pots because what is going to happen is not only are they going
[08:51.180 --> 08:54.580]  to choke themselves, they are going to begin to auto flower.
[08:54.580 --> 08:57.860]  They're going to start flowering because they're root bound and they're stressed.
[08:57.860 --> 09:01.740]  So imagine if they were outside and that the roots didn't have anywhere to go, the plant
[09:01.740 --> 09:03.340]  would say, shit, I'm stuck.
[09:03.340 --> 09:04.540]  I can't grow anymore.
[09:04.540 --> 09:07.940]  I'm going to go into my final phase of life, which is flowering.
[09:07.940 --> 09:12.440]  So they will try to flower on you indoors under plenty of light if you don't get them
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.440]  into bigger pots.
[09:13.440 --> 09:15.860]  That is the first thing to be concerned about.
[09:15.860 --> 09:20.180]  That thing you said about them getting leggy instead of bushy, that is absolutely another
[09:20.180 --> 09:21.540]  thing that is going to happen.
[09:21.540 --> 09:24.500]  You've got too many plants crowded together.
[09:24.540 --> 09:25.980]  Imagine you're in a crowded room.
[09:25.980 --> 09:27.300]  You can't spread out your arms.
[09:27.300 --> 09:28.700]  Okay, think about the subway.
[09:28.700 --> 09:29.700]  There aren't enough seats.
[09:29.700 --> 09:32.900]  You don't walk through the subway with your arms open and you don't spread your legs real
[09:32.900 --> 09:33.900]  far.
[09:33.900 --> 09:35.060]  You're not man spreading on the subway.
[09:35.060 --> 09:38.220]  You stand tall and keep your arms at your side because it's too damn crowded.
[09:38.220 --> 09:39.980]  That's what your plants are going to do.
[09:39.980 --> 09:43.900]  They're going to get tall and leggy and root bound and they're going to try to flower.
[09:43.900 --> 09:45.160]  You want them bushy.
[09:45.160 --> 09:46.340]  You need to top them.
[09:46.340 --> 09:51.060]  Topping them is probably the only way you're going to keep these plants short.
[09:51.060 --> 09:53.820]  Also, this may sound crazy.
[09:53.820 --> 09:57.620]  Give them as much light as you can possibly give them.
[09:57.620 --> 09:59.740]  Too little light will cause them to stretch.
[09:59.740 --> 10:01.860]  A lot of light will prevent stretch.
[10:01.860 --> 10:02.980]  That will keep them short.
[10:02.980 --> 10:06.780]  It's not going to do a lot with the amount of time you've got, but it will prevent them
[10:06.780 --> 10:08.540]  from stretching too much.
[10:08.540 --> 10:09.940]  More light will prevent stretch.
[10:09.940 --> 10:14.860]  Also, I have found that a short dark period, you need them to sleep, that will prevent
[10:14.860 --> 10:15.860]  the stretch.
[10:15.860 --> 10:18.860]  They're just going to take off and grow straight up during all that day period.
[10:18.860 --> 10:22.380]  If you give them some sleeping period, they will bush out a little bit more.
[10:22.380 --> 10:25.640]  In my experience, I've talked about veg times a lot on the show.
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.500]  Give them some sleep time, they bush out a little bit more.
[10:28.500 --> 10:30.640]  Also, think about your nutrients.
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.060]  A little more phosphorus and potassium may help them bush out a little bit.
[10:35.060 --> 10:37.180]  You don't have to push the nutrients super hard.
[10:37.180 --> 10:39.780]  That also may help keep them a little small.
[10:39.780 --> 10:45.380]  What you need to do, honestly, is get a bigger space or maybe select your favorites.
[10:45.380 --> 10:47.380]  That's probably what I would do.
[10:47.380 --> 10:49.420]  Or okay, we've got a few options here.
[10:49.460 --> 10:52.660]  You really need to spread them out and give these plants more space, or they're going
[10:52.660 --> 10:55.540]  to get tall, skinny, leggy, stretchy, and ugly.
[10:55.540 --> 10:57.060]  That is not really what you want.
[10:57.060 --> 10:59.340]  What you need to do is up-pot them.
[10:59.340 --> 11:02.420]  If you can't do that, I would eliminate some of them.
[11:02.420 --> 11:07.100]  That may not be the best bet for you because you've got 10 of them, you may want 10 outside,
[11:07.100 --> 11:10.840]  but you can either have 10 shitty plants or 6 really nice plants.
[11:10.840 --> 11:12.760]  That may be your option right now.
[11:12.760 --> 11:18.100]  Another thing you can do if you've got the ability, you can take clones from these plants
[11:18.100 --> 11:19.540]  while they're too tall.
[11:19.540 --> 11:22.860]  Take those stretchy tops and just create them into clones.
[11:22.860 --> 11:26.140]  Then throw away the other plants and use the clones.
[11:26.140 --> 11:29.900]  They are much smaller, they are more manageable, they haven't gotten out of control.
[11:29.900 --> 11:31.260]  That is always an option.
[11:31.260 --> 11:34.780]  I don't know if those clones will be big enough to go outdoors in the time you're trying to
[11:34.780 --> 11:37.980]  get out there, but in some situations this may work.
[11:37.980 --> 11:40.820]  I'm just coming up with things that could work for you.
[11:40.820 --> 11:41.820]  You need to up-pot them.
[11:41.820 --> 11:43.980]  It would probably be your best bet.
[11:43.980 --> 11:49.100]  Then top them, then spread them out the best you can, then possibly take some clones, then
[11:49.100 --> 11:51.540]  possibly eliminate the plants that you don't need.
[11:51.540 --> 11:54.500]  There have got to be a few in there that you look at them and you go, yeah, that one could
[11:54.500 --> 11:55.500]  go.
[11:55.500 --> 11:56.500]  Just cut it down, get rid of it.
[11:56.500 --> 12:01.140]  Like I said earlier, if you've got too many plants, if you were above your plant count,
[12:01.140 --> 12:05.140]  if you were stressed about it, now's the time to knock out a couple of those ugly plants
[12:05.140 --> 12:06.820]  and just say goodbye to them.
[12:06.820 --> 12:08.060]  You're saying goodbye to a headache.
[12:08.060 --> 12:11.740]  You were looking forward to a better grow and you're getting rid of the bullshit.
[12:11.740 --> 12:14.100]  Think of it that way if that is an option.
[12:14.100 --> 12:15.700]  Now there is more to this message.
[12:15.700 --> 12:19.660]  It says, any tips on keeping them from growing too quickly?
[12:19.660 --> 12:24.420]  Quarter strength newts, 14 hour lights on cycle, cooler temps, weaker lighting.
[12:24.420 --> 12:29.020]  I'm wondering if a 60 degree basement with one or two T5s may keep them small, but at
[12:29.020 --> 12:31.740]  the same time, I don't want them stretching for the light.
[12:31.740 --> 12:33.500]  Yes, they will stretch for the light.
[12:33.500 --> 12:35.820]  If you put them under T5s, they are going to stretch.
[12:35.820 --> 12:37.860]  They want as much light as possible.
[12:37.860 --> 12:39.260]  More light will keep them shorter.
[12:39.260 --> 12:41.980]  I know that sounds like they'll grow more quickly with light.
[12:41.980 --> 12:42.980]  They will.
[12:42.980 --> 12:47.220]  They'll bush out, they'll get thicker, they'll be healthier, they'll have more general vigor,
[12:47.220 --> 12:49.100]  but they won't be taller.
[12:49.100 --> 12:51.660]  Height isn't always a good indicator of growth.
[12:51.660 --> 12:55.380]  Height is also stretch and says right here, stretching for the light, just like you're
[12:55.380 --> 12:56.380]  saying.
[12:56.380 --> 12:59.940]  If you really want to stress them, you could go super cold or super hot.
[12:59.940 --> 13:00.940]  That will slow them down.
[13:00.940 --> 13:05.420]  A 60 degree basement with too much light may be a good idea at this point.
[13:05.420 --> 13:08.660]  I wouldn't generally recommend that, but you're trying to fuck these plants up and slow them
[13:08.660 --> 13:09.660]  down.
[13:09.660 --> 13:13.700]  Go too cold and give them too much light or go too hot and give them too much light.
[13:13.700 --> 13:15.820]  That will stunt them and slow them down.
[13:15.820 --> 13:17.620]  There's a product out there called Bushmaster.
[13:17.620 --> 13:19.420]  I usually don't recommend specific products.
[13:19.420 --> 13:23.340]  A product called Bushmaster will make these plants stay short and squat and make them
[13:23.340 --> 13:24.340]  bush out.
[13:24.340 --> 13:28.380]  If you can add some Bushmaster to your feeding regimen, that should help you out a little
[13:28.380 --> 13:29.380]  bit.
[13:29.380 --> 13:32.620]  You can also continue Bushmaster through the early parts of flower and it will keep your
[13:32.620 --> 13:36.460]  plants nice and short and prevent that early flower stretch.
[13:36.460 --> 13:38.700]  But mainly, you need to up-pot these plants.
[13:38.700 --> 13:41.820]  They are going to auto-flower on you if you do not up-pot them.
[13:41.820 --> 13:45.060]  No matter when you put them outdoors, they'll start flowering on you.
[13:45.060 --> 13:47.420]  These plants also need a little bit of space.
[13:47.420 --> 13:48.580]  You need to pull them apart.
[13:48.580 --> 13:50.360]  Make sure they're not touching each other.
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.260]  If they are touching each other, it may be a good idea to get rid of a couple of them.
[13:54.260 --> 13:59.060]  Like I said earlier, you can have 10 shitty plants or you can have 6 really stellar plants.
[13:59.060 --> 14:02.060]  That may be a decision you need to make at this time.
[14:02.060 --> 14:04.340]  Also, you can clone them.
[14:04.340 --> 14:08.420]  You can cut clones off of each one and then you can just label it number one, plant number
[14:08.420 --> 14:10.980]  one, clone number one, plant number two, clone number two.
[14:10.980 --> 14:14.340]  As soon as you see roots out of clone number two, you can throw away plant number two.
[14:14.340 --> 14:18.340]  You know you've got a backup copy and that can be the one that you nurture up to the
[14:18.340 --> 14:21.980]  right size and you put it out to flower in May in Massachusetts.
[14:21.980 --> 14:23.700]  We're in the middle of April right now.
[14:23.700 --> 14:25.100]  You've got two weeks.
[14:25.100 --> 14:26.940]  You barely have time to get a clone rooted.
[14:26.940 --> 14:30.100]  That wouldn't be a reasonable solution in your situation.
[14:30.100 --> 14:33.380]  But in some cases, that may be what some people have to do.
[14:33.420 --> 14:37.660]  If your plants are too tall, just cut a clone from it and start fresh with a little plant.
[14:37.660 --> 14:42.140]  If somebody gives me a big plant, if you give me a plant like a one or a three gallon pot,
[14:42.140 --> 14:44.980]  I usually generally don't take that home and flower that.
[14:44.980 --> 14:49.060]  I clone it and make a couple of clones and throw the big plant away because I want to
[14:49.060 --> 14:50.780]  start fresh with the tiny plant.
[14:50.780 --> 14:52.340]  I want to cause my own problems.
[14:52.340 --> 14:55.620]  I don't want to work with a plant that's already stretched out and fucked up and has a bunch
[14:55.620 --> 14:56.620]  of problems.
[14:56.620 --> 14:57.620]  I want a littler plant.
[14:57.620 --> 14:59.460]  You can treat it with pesticides better.
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.120]  You can treat it with foliar sprays better.
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.480]  You can nurse it back to health much more easily if you've got that little plant.
[15:04.480 --> 15:06.720]  So that may be an option for some folks.
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.040]  Seems like you're a little behind the deadline for that one.
[15:09.040 --> 15:12.160]  What is not going to work is putting them under weaker light.
[15:12.160 --> 15:13.800]  Weaker light is going to cause them to stretch.
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.260]  It is going to have the exact opposite effect of what you're expecting.
[15:17.260 --> 15:18.640]  So do not do that.
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.480]  Dude, I hope I have given you enough info, guidance, and advice to help you keep these
[15:23.480 --> 15:25.960]  plants a little bit short and a little bit squatty.
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.000]  You may need to top them.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.480]  I'm not sure what you're going to do.
[15:28.480 --> 15:30.640]  I would love to hear how you handle this.
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.200]  I cannot wait to see pictures of your outdoor crop from Massachusetts at the end of the
[15:35.200 --> 15:36.200]  year.
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.680]  He wraps up this email and he says, thanks for any advice and keep up the great work
[15:39.680 --> 15:40.680]  from Andrew.
[15:40.680 --> 15:41.760]  He says, P.S.
[15:41.760 --> 15:44.600]  I cannot wait for Lemon Jeffery to be back in stock.
[15:44.600 --> 15:48.000]  I'm planning on a batch of Arise and Lemon Jeffery.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.920]  Well, I've got good news for you.
[15:49.920 --> 15:55.000]  I should have Lemon Jeffery seeds available by 7-10.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  You'll be able to find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  So stay tuned and check back often.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.320]  I want to thank Andrew once again for a great email and a great question.
[16:04.320 --> 16:07.640]  If you have any questions that you would like read on the show, send me an email.
[16:07.640 --> 16:10.760]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[16:10.760 --> 16:12.800]  I would love to hear from you.
[16:12.800 --> 16:14.520]  Let's keep moving along with the emails.
[16:14.520 --> 16:17.320]  The next email goes just like this.
[16:17.320 --> 16:18.880]  Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[16:18.880 --> 16:20.560]  Thank you for your podcast.
[16:20.560 --> 16:21.560]  You're very welcome.
[16:21.560 --> 16:23.480]  It is really informative and entertaining.
[16:23.480 --> 16:24.480]  Hey, thank you.
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.840]  That is a great compliment because that tells me I am hitting my exact goal.
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.080]  The message goes on to say, I appreciate you sharing your knowledge, which has helped
[16:32.080 --> 16:33.480]  me improve my garden.
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.320]  I wanted to share something I started doing that may help others.
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.680]  Starting seedlings and clones in a solo cup is recommended in many places, but I have
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.400]  started a modification on this practice.
[16:46.400 --> 16:47.880]  And then part of the email is cut off here.
[16:47.880 --> 16:50.880]  I'm not sure what happened when I printed it, but part of it got cut off.
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.520]  And it says, I really wanted to see how the roots take hold in the soil, is what it looks
[16:55.520 --> 16:56.840]  like it should say.
[16:56.840 --> 17:01.880]  Then the message describes how this guy pots his clones and seedlings into a clear beer
[17:01.880 --> 17:04.040]  cup filled with soil.
[17:04.040 --> 17:10.200]  Then he takes the clear beer cup and slides it inside a regular beer cup so that the roots
[17:10.200 --> 17:12.040]  are shaded for the light.
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.400]  Now a lot of this message is cut off, but I understand why this guy is doing it.
[17:15.400 --> 17:20.060]  And I have done this to show new people in gardens how to look at the roots and what's
[17:20.060 --> 17:22.560]  a watch for and how to know when to transplant.
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.040]  So what this guy is doing with part of his email missing here, I'll explain what he's
[17:26.040 --> 17:27.040]  trying to say.
[17:27.040 --> 17:32.280]  He is taking a seedling or a clone and he is potting it in a beer cup filled with soil,
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.120]  but he is using a clear cup so that as the roots develop, he can watch the roots grow
[17:37.120 --> 17:38.680]  and take over that soil.
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.900]  It is really fun to watch.
[17:39.900 --> 17:41.560]  It is really interesting to watch.
[17:41.560 --> 17:42.560]  So it is a really good idea.
[17:42.560 --> 17:44.680]  It is a great way to teach people about soil.
[17:44.680 --> 17:46.840]  It is a great way to teach people about roots.
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.760]  It's a great way to learn about soil and roots and about how the plant grows and about the
[17:50.760 --> 17:53.080]  direction that the roots take over the soil.
[17:53.080 --> 17:54.660]  So it is a really good practice.
[17:54.660 --> 17:59.860]  The downfall is that the roots are very sensitive to light and we are putting these plants under
[17:59.860 --> 18:02.460]  ridiculously bright lights all day long.
[18:02.460 --> 18:06.700]  So it is counterproductive to have a clear container for our roots.
[18:06.700 --> 18:07.980]  We're trying to grow fat roots.
[18:07.980 --> 18:10.520]  Those roots come out, they see the light, the light hits them, they start getting beat
[18:10.520 --> 18:14.820]  down by the light and they start deteriorating and getting broken down and they start receding.
[18:14.820 --> 18:19.240]  So this guy has gotten the idea of planting his clone into a clear cup and then gently
[18:19.240 --> 18:24.500]  setting that clear cup into a colored cup so that the roots are not exposed to the harmful
[18:24.540 --> 18:25.540]  light.
[18:25.540 --> 18:27.020]  Now this is a great idea.
[18:27.020 --> 18:31.900]  Just be sure to poke holes in the bottom of each cup so that we have plenty of drainage
[18:31.900 --> 18:32.900]  holes.
[18:32.900 --> 18:36.020]  We don't want water getting built up in that cup and then we're going to drown those precious
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.900]  roots that we're trying to watch.
[18:37.900 --> 18:38.900]  This is a great idea.
[18:38.900 --> 18:41.740]  By doing this, we can watch the development of our roots.
[18:41.740 --> 18:45.940]  By doing this, we can see exactly when that container is filled with roots.
[18:45.940 --> 18:50.340]  We can see when those roots are wrapping around that container, around that soil medium and
[18:50.340 --> 18:56.180]  it's overtaking that container and we know exactly the best time to transplant that plant.
[18:56.180 --> 19:00.760]  So this is a really good idea and I think that a lot of new growers could probably learn
[19:00.760 --> 19:06.020]  a lot by doing this and it is probably just fun to share if you are a commercial grower,
[19:06.020 --> 19:10.140]  if you're a trainer, if you're an educator, this is a good way to show people about roots
[19:10.140 --> 19:11.140]  and root development.
[19:11.140 --> 19:14.060]  So I want to give a big shout out to my friend who sent me this message.
[19:14.060 --> 19:18.020]  He said, in the spirit of your podcast, I wanted to give back some knowledge and share
[19:18.020 --> 19:21.100]  something that's really been working well for me.
[19:21.100 --> 19:23.500]  Thank you for what you do, Jeff, and keep the faith.
[19:23.500 --> 19:27.740]  And then he signed it, G. So big shout out to my friend, G. Thank you for the great idea.
[19:27.740 --> 19:28.820]  Thank you for the great tip.
[19:28.820 --> 19:33.400]  I'm sure somebody will use that and I'm sure they will enjoy watching the little ant farm
[19:33.400 --> 19:35.220]  that is their root zone develop.
[19:35.220 --> 19:39.220]  He also says, P.S. I'm waiting for the return of Lemon Jeffery 2.
[19:39.220 --> 19:41.180]  Thanks for the ETA on the last show.
[19:41.180 --> 19:43.620]  You folks seem clairvoyant.
[19:43.620 --> 19:45.260]  You know, I don't think it was clairvoyancy.
[19:45.260 --> 19:48.980]  I think it was an influx of emails requesting the Lemon Jeffery.
[19:48.980 --> 19:50.140]  So that's what got it for you.
[19:50.140 --> 19:54.440]  Hey, I can't wait to get some Lemon Jeffery in your hands, and I cannot wait to see pictures
[19:54.440 --> 19:56.740]  of the Lemon G in your garden.
[19:56.740 --> 19:59.060]  Hey, G. Big thanks for the great email.
[19:59.060 --> 20:00.780]  I do appreciate it.
[20:00.780 --> 20:04.740]  And once again, if anybody else out there has a cannabis grow question, a cannabis industry
[20:04.740 --> 20:09.060]  question, a cannabis community or culture question, I would love to answer your questions.
[20:09.060 --> 20:12.780]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:12.780 --> 20:14.780]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[20:15.300 --> 20:17.180]  420 is quickly approaching.
[20:17.180 --> 20:19.460]  We've only got a couple of days until 420.
