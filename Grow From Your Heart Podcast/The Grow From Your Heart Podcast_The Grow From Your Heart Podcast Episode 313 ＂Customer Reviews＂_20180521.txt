[00:00.320 --> 00:04.600]  Hey what up cannabis community it's time for episode 313 of the Grow From Your
[00:04.600 --> 00:08.880]  Heart podcast. My name is Rasta Jeff, thanks again for joining me. This episode
[00:08.880 --> 00:12.080]  of the podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:12.080 --> 00:16.280]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[00:16.280 --> 00:21.360]  Company. You can find them at dankseed.store. Also, if you want to know
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.200]  what's going on in your grow room and you're not there, if you want to know
[00:24.200 --> 00:27.560]  what the temperature and humidity of your grow room are right now, you'd be
[00:27.560 --> 00:30.920]  able to find out by looking at your phone and logging into your Minder unit
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.680]  from PL Grow Systems. Make sure you check them out at PLGrow.Systems. Alright
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.800]  you guys, I like to start these episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking
[00:39.800 --> 00:44.520]  on. Today I've been taking dabs of Papaya Punch number four from Oleo and
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.480]  this stuff is delicious. I'm cracking open the jar right now to get a fresh
[00:48.480 --> 00:56.440]  smell. It smells like a juicy papaya. It smells like grape sweet tarts, like the
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.520]  purple sweet tarts. It smells like they're right in your face. It smells
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.680]  juicy. It's kind of mouth-watering. It is perfect visually. It's a really light
[01:04.680 --> 01:10.520]  golden color. It's lighter than honey. It is kind of a bright yellow color. It's
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.360]  got just the right amount of crystals to just the right amount of sauce. I am
[01:14.360 --> 01:18.960]  impressed and in love with the Papaya Punch number four sauce from those great
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.600]  folks over at Oleo. Alright you guys, next thing I want to do is read some iTunes
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.680]  ratings and reviews. These are customer reviews from iTunes. If you were
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.320]  listening to the podcast on iTunes and you'd like to leave a review, simply open
[01:32.320 --> 01:36.320]  up the podcast on your phone and just scroll down past the available episodes
[01:36.320 --> 01:39.240]  and then you will see the ratings and reviews. If you'd like to leave a review,
[01:39.240 --> 01:43.040]  all you have to do is click on, let's see where does it go, you scroll down it says
[01:43.040 --> 01:46.880]  available episodes, it says previously played, then it shows the reviews. Right there in
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.280]  the middle says write a review. All you've got to do is click on there. It
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.120]  gives you the option to give me the amount of stars you think I deserve. You
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.000]  can give me up to five stars. So far a hundred and sixteen people have given
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.080]  the show a five star review. Give me as many stars as you feel I deserve, give it
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.040]  a little title, then type in a customer review and I will read your review on a
[02:07.040 --> 02:10.560]  future episode. Alright so I'm gonna scroll down and get to the most recent
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.880]  customer reviews. Alright this first review I want to read was left on March
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.360]  15th by a person who calls themselves Clash Cabra. I hope I said that
[02:18.360 --> 02:22.680]  correctly. The headline is amazing show. They gave me a five star review and it
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.320]  goes like this, listening to Jeff is fun, educating, and compelling. Heartfelt
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.280]  comments with incredibly educated commentary make this show a must if you
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.840]  are interested in the world of cannabis. Changing the world one show at a time.
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.640]  You know I may have read that review before but that was a good one so it was
[02:39.640 --> 02:43.960]  worth reading again if I did. So I guess the first thing I should say is thanks
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.400]  for having fun and learning with me. I'm glad you find me fun and I'm glad that
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.560]  you're learning. That was exactly my goal so thanks a lot for that. And then thanks
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.800]  for saying that I'm changing the world one show at a time. That is huge. That
[02:54.800 --> 03:01.000]  means a lot to me. I did not realize the magnitude of what I'm doing and I try
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.080]  not to think about how big that is so I just try to stay humbled and not think
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.480]  about that stuff but thank you. That does mean a lot to me. So thanks for the great
[03:08.480 --> 03:11.960]  compliments. Thanks for the great customer review and of course thanks for
[03:11.960 --> 03:16.880]  the five stars. I'm trying to get my iPad to open up the next review. It goes like
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.600]  this. It's from a person who calls themselves Sweet Chick Tennessee. It was
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.560]  left on May 29th. The headline is very informational. Then the review goes like
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.200]  this. Great information and delivered very well. Once again thank you because
[03:30.200 --> 03:33.560]  that's exactly what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to give you great information and
[03:33.560 --> 03:38.000]  I'm trying to deliver it in a way that sounds good. I've got good equipment. I
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.320]  want this to sound well produced and I want to speak mostly clearly. I know
[03:42.320 --> 03:45.340]  sometimes I get carried away and I've got my own personality and I speak the
[03:45.340 --> 03:49.480]  way I speak but I try to be clear and I try to enunciate and I try to give clear
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.640]  instructions and explain things well and I try to explain things in different
[03:52.640 --> 03:56.920]  ways so that different thought processes can absorb what I'm trying to say. So
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.600]  thanks for noticing that it's delivered very well. I work hard at that. Thank you
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.120]  for the review and thank you for the five stars and thanks for listening to
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.920]  the podcast. This next review was left on April 9th and it was left by a person
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.240]  who calls themselves Desiree Peralta 1. Shout out to Desiree Peralta. Desiree
[04:14.240 --> 04:18.040]  says I'm not even a grower but this is still one of my favorite podcasts.
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.400]  Rasta Jeff is well-spoken and entertaining. 12 out of 10 would
[04:22.400 --> 04:27.040]  recommend. Dude, I got two bonus, bonus would recommends out of there. It's only
[04:27.040 --> 04:30.560]  supposed to go to 10. She gave me 12. I must be nailing it for Desiree. Hey, thank
[04:30.560 --> 04:34.520]  you. Thanks for the huge compliment. Thanks for the great review. Thank you
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.040]  for listening to the podcast and of course thank you for a five-star review.
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.000]  That is super kind of you. I appreciate it. This next review comes from a listener
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.960]  who calls themselves Daryl Strawberry Jr. I feel like I may have read some of
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.160]  Daryl Strawberry Jr.'s reviews before but this one goes like this. The headline
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.720]  says The Lemon G of Podcasts and if you are a cannabis consumer in Colorado
[04:56.720 --> 05:01.480]  that's a huge compliment. That means I stand out and I'm terpy. So the review
[05:01.480 --> 05:05.440]  goes like this. Great information and Jeff keeps it very interesting. Thank you
[05:05.440 --> 05:10.080]  for freely contributing to the community in an unbiased manner. Man, that's huge.
[05:10.080 --> 05:15.040]  That's a huge compliment. I do try to keep it interesting and I try to do have
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.400]  great information so I'm nailing that. Thank you for noticing that. Then you
[05:18.400 --> 05:21.960]  point out that I'm freely contributing to the community. Yes, this is free. I do
[05:21.960 --> 05:26.600]  not charge anything for this. I do have a Patreon campaign that if people would
[05:26.600 --> 05:30.600]  like to contribute to they can do so but this is free for everybody. I want
[05:30.600 --> 05:35.560]  everybody to grow the best cannabis that they could possibly produce. Some people
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.840]  have all of the gear, the best seeds, the best nutrients. All they need is some
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.760]  good advice. I'm here to do that. So thanks for noticing that I'm doing that
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.120]  for the community for free. Also in an unbiased manner I do have my own
[05:49.120 --> 05:52.880]  opinions and feelings and my ideas of certain things. I just try to keep a lot
[05:52.880 --> 05:57.360]  of that out of the podcast. My opinion of a lot of things doesn't matter to you.
[05:57.360 --> 06:00.840]  What's going to make your garden better? What's gonna make your life easier?
[06:00.840 --> 06:06.120]  What's going to help you increase your yields or improve your potency or help
[06:06.120 --> 06:09.480]  you medicate yourself more properly? That's what you want to hear from me. You
[06:09.480 --> 06:13.740]  don't want to hear about my crap so I try to keep it unbiased. If I do have
[06:13.740 --> 06:17.940]  an opinion on something that is going to affect the cannabis community I do
[06:17.940 --> 06:22.060]  try to share that but I try not to be biased. I try to have an open mind and an
[06:22.060 --> 06:25.460]  open heart in everything I do because when you close your mind and you close
[06:25.460 --> 06:30.060]  your heart you can't learn. So I try to deliver content in an unbiased manner. I
[06:30.060 --> 06:34.300]  try not to put too much of my own personal stuff into it. If you
[06:34.300 --> 06:37.500]  listen to the show a lot you'll know I am biased. I'm biased against
[06:37.500 --> 06:42.420]  autoflower seeds. When I first started doing this show 313 episodes about four
[06:42.540 --> 06:47.620]  years ago I didn't like, support, endorse, or care for autoflowers at all. But since
[06:47.620 --> 06:53.340]  I kept an open mind and I listened to people now I kind of find the
[06:53.340 --> 07:00.100]  acceptable use, the spot for that product. So I was biased and I just had to learn
[07:00.100 --> 07:03.620]  how to kind of keep some of that out of the show and if you watch my Instagram
[07:03.620 --> 07:07.420]  live videos that's where you'll get more of my opinions and my feelings. I just
[07:07.420 --> 07:11.340]  don't feel like that's what a lot of you are here for. I do start the podcast off
[07:11.340 --> 07:15.740]  by talking about my life sometimes but I try not to bring too many of my
[07:15.740 --> 07:20.460]  beliefs or my political ideas or too much of that kind of stuff or brand
[07:20.460 --> 07:25.060]  loyalty. I try not to bring too much of that to the this podcast. Of course
[07:25.060 --> 07:29.300]  business is business and I'm a human so things are gonna come through and
[07:29.300 --> 07:33.100]  without my personality this podcast wouldn't be this podcast so I've got to
[07:33.100 --> 07:36.500]  put myself into it. But thank you. Thank you for noticing that I try to stay fair
[07:36.500 --> 07:42.540]  and unbiased. I try not to form opinions on new ideas, new products,
[07:42.540 --> 07:45.980]  new methods or techniques until I've actually had time to research it and
[07:45.980 --> 07:49.780]  look at what I'm talking about. I try to keep an open mind so thanks for noticing
[07:49.780 --> 07:54.620]  that. The last line of this customer review says Jeff is solely responsible
[07:54.620 --> 07:59.420]  for 36.4 of all hugs given to moms. Hey that's pretty good. I'll be
[07:59.420 --> 08:03.020]  responsible for one-third of all of the hugs given to moms. That's pretty awesome.
[08:03.260 --> 08:07.340]  I have definitely been blamed for a lot worse things so that's something that I
[08:07.340 --> 08:13.460]  could add to my resume. Responsible for one-third or 36.4% of all hugs given to
[08:13.460 --> 08:16.860]  moms. Can I claim that? Is that something I can put on a resume? Can I put that on
[08:16.860 --> 08:21.140]  my Facebook profile? I might add that. Hey Daryl Strawberry Jr. Is it Daryl
[08:21.140 --> 08:24.100]  Strawberry Jr.? Let's look again. Daryl Strawberry Jr. thanks for the great
[08:24.100 --> 08:28.300]  customer review. Thanks for the five stars and thanks for listening to the
[08:28.300 --> 08:33.780]  podcast. You guys, the great reviews keep going. This one I can't read the full
[08:33.780 --> 08:38.780]  headline but it says good dot dot dot. This one was left by a
[08:38.780 --> 08:43.060]  person who calls themselves Frankie 456. Of course they gave me a five-star
[08:43.060 --> 08:47.540]  review and the customer review goes like this. I look forward to this podcast
[08:47.540 --> 08:51.760]  every week. Thanks man. Hey you're very welcome. I've been putting out two
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.660]  episodes so I hope you're listening to both of them and I hope you're hearing
[08:54.780 --> 08:57.980]  the Thursday episodes because that's where you got a shout out. Hey Frankie
[08:57.980 --> 09:02.620]  456, big shout out. Thanks for listening to the show and thanks for the customer
[09:02.620 --> 09:05.940]  review. Hey dude, thanks for listening every week. That means a lot to me. And
[09:05.940 --> 09:10.860]  you're welcome by the way. This next review, the headline is great vibe. This
[09:10.860 --> 09:14.020]  one was left only 14 hours ago. This one was left by a person who calls
[09:14.020 --> 09:20.380]  themselves Madcap V2. The customer review goes like this. I've been listening for
[09:20.380 --> 09:25.660]  about a month. Love the show. I would enjoy more strain reviews. Keep it up. It
[09:25.660 --> 09:30.380]  really makes my Monday morning drives a lot better. Thank you Jeff. Hey thanks for
[09:30.380 --> 09:34.020]  listening for the past month. I'm glad you love the show. The strain reviews,
[09:34.020 --> 09:37.740]  what they're talking about is I have done strain specific episodes where I
[09:37.740 --> 09:41.100]  talk about strains that I have bred. We've done the morning dew, we did
[09:41.100 --> 09:45.820]  firefly, and we did the cream. It feels a little weird sitting here for 30 minutes
[09:45.820 --> 09:49.260]  talking about my own strains. It feels a little egotistical but since you guys
[09:49.260 --> 09:54.140]  are asking for more, that means I've got to deliver more of those to you. So Madcap
[09:54.140 --> 09:58.500]  V2, look forward to more of those episodes coming in the future. Hey thanks
[09:58.500 --> 10:03.700]  for the great customer review and of course thanks for the five-star rating.
[10:03.700 --> 10:09.020]  Also you titled that customer review great vibe. I appreciate that. Thanks a
[10:09.020 --> 10:13.820]  lot for thinking I've got a great vibe. Vibes are important to me. Alright you
[10:13.820 --> 10:17.760]  guys I've got one more customer review that I would like to read. This one was
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.680]  left just 12 hours ago. It was left by a person who calls themselves Red House
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.960]  Grows. The headline is awesome podcast. Of course they left a five-star rating
[10:25.960 --> 10:31.080]  and the customer review goes like this. Love the podcast. Currently at episode
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.600]  250 and catching all the way up at 4 to 12 hours a day of listening to your show
[10:35.600 --> 10:38.920]  and the Dude Grows show. Hey shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows. If you're
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.560]  not listening to the Dude Grows show, make sure you check them out. The review
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.280]  keeps going. He says keeps my sanity at work and for that I thank you Rasta Jeff.
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.040]  Signed Red House Grows. Hey Red House Grows, I'm glad I'm keeping you sane dude.
[10:52.040 --> 10:55.320]  Thanks for listening to the podcast. Hey I hope you're gonna be okay when you
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.160]  catch up to all the episodes. If you're listening to 4 to 12 hours a day, you're
[10:59.160 --> 11:03.800]  gonna be caught up really soon. The Throwback Thursday episodes end at 282 I
[11:03.800 --> 11:08.480]  believe. So you are gonna get caught up really soon. That means I'm gonna have to
[11:08.480 --> 11:11.760]  start stepping it up and putting out more content. Hopefully between the Dude
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.400]  and Scotty and myself we can keep your head right. Hey Red House Grows, seriously
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.280]  thank you for the great review and thank you for the five-star rating. I appreciate
[11:21.280 --> 11:25.200]  it. Keep listening my friend and I will keep putting out great content for you.
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.680]  Alright guys that is all of the iTunes customer reviews for now. I want to thank
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.720]  everybody who's left an iTunes customer review whether it was this batch that I
[11:33.720 --> 11:37.520]  just read or from the past. Thank you and I would appreciate it if you're listening
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.000]  on iTunes if you go and leave me a customer rating and review. What that
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  does is it makes more people see my show in iTunes. The more people that see the
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.280]  show, the more people listen, the more people that are listening, the more
[11:49.280 --> 11:52.880]  people we have on our side helping us legalize cannabis, the more educated
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.240]  soldiers we've got on the army, then that also means there are more people out
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.240]  there growing better cannabis. So leave me a customer rating and review that'll
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.080]  move us up in the rankings in iTunes and more people will listen to the show and
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.240]  I would appreciate it. Alright you guys I promised that I had some emails. Let's
[12:10.240 --> 12:13.960]  start right at the start of the pile. This one, I don't know if they want their
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.240]  name said, it goes like this. That was a great Thursday quickie about adapting
[12:18.240 --> 12:21.480]  with the plants and if you don't know what that's from he's referring to an
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.280]  episode I did a couple of weeks ago about having to adjust and adapt.
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.840]  Sometimes you're gonna have to change your plans on the fly. Sometimes things
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.480]  are gonna change in the grow and you're going to have to pay attention and
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.600]  adjust and adapt. So thanks for enjoying that episode. The email continues with,
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.000]  I was going to send an email to ask what I should do to make my grow run
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.600]  perfectly with the new Arise and Cream seeds that I just popped but this
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.080]  podcast was right on point. Great job Rasta Jeff, keep up the good work and
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.400]  let's get you on the Joe Rogan podcast one day. Dude when I read that I got
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.200]  intimidated. I would love to go on the Joe Rogan podcast. I'm not sure what I
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.840]  would talk about for three hours. I'm sure I'd come up with something but sure
[13:00.840 --> 13:06.240]  let's do that. Maybe I could actually live out one of these weird scenarios
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.280]  I've been playing in my head. You guys I haven't eaten meat in about 18 years.
[13:10.280 --> 13:16.240]  I've been a vegetarian since around the year 2000. It may be time for me to start
[13:16.240 --> 13:19.720]  eating meat again. I could explain but just I'm getting skinny. I'm getting
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.120]  older and I'm getting skinnier. I need more energy. I need to build instead of
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.040]  shrinking and I'm approaching 40 so it may be time to add meat back into my
[13:28.040 --> 13:33.520]  diet. I've been a vegetarian for a lot of reasons for a long time and it may be
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.080]  time. I'm not ready to go to the store and buy myself a steak. I'm definitely
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.800]  not gonna go to some shitty restaurant and get a half-assed piece of meat. What
[13:41.800 --> 13:49.720]  I would do is I would eat some of the elk harvested by Joe Rogan. I respect and
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.720]  trust the way that Joe Rogan harvests his meat. I know he does it ethically. I
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.600]  know he does it respectfully. I know he does it responsibly. If Rogan were to
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.040]  take down an elk and send me, he may have to cook it. He may have to pre-cook it
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.840]  for me, put it in his Yeti cooler, do his fancy cooking, and then send it to me and
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.960]  give me specific instructions on how to reheat that shit properly. Or maybe I
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.280]  could have one of my friends come over and they can show me how to remind me
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.560]  how to cook meat since I haven't done that since the year 2000. But if Rogan
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.920]  sent me an elk steak that was prepared and all I had to do was warm it up, or if
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.200]  he sent me an elk steak that all I had to do was cook it and he taught me how
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.720]  to cook it, you guys, I would definitely take a couple of fat bites and chew it
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.640]  up and swallow it and give it like 10 minutes and see how I feel. If it doesn't
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.040]  kill me, I'll probably eat more. If it kills me, I'm obviously not gonna eat
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.040]  more. But that's what I would like to do on the Joe Rogan podcast if I were on
[14:47.040 --> 14:52.720]  there. Also talk about cannabis, also pitch my show, but that's kind of a weird
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.520]  scenario. It's not a bucket list thing because it's not something that I have
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.000]  to eat elk with Rogan, but it's an opportunity that I would take if it were
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.440]  available. And I keep kind of, I've tweeted it and I've had a couple other
[15:04.440 --> 15:07.920]  people tweet about it, so maybe, just maybe now that I've said it on the show,
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.960]  maybe that will happen. Hey Rogan, Mr. Joe Rogan, I fully respect you and I love the
[15:13.960 --> 15:19.400]  way that you hunt and represent hunters. I've been a vegetarian for 20 years. My
[15:19.400 --> 15:23.040]  body is indicating that it may be time to add some animal protein back into my
[15:23.040 --> 15:29.400]  diet. Powerful Joe Rogan, it would be an honor if I could break my nearly 20-year
[15:29.400 --> 15:34.480]  streak of being a vegetarian by consuming some of your fine elk steaks,
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.320]  my friend. Alright you guys, I put that out there. Maybe Joe Rogan will hear that.
[15:38.320 --> 15:42.520]  You never know. Now I'm kind of on the spot. What if this does come up, you guys?
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.720]  Anyway, let's keep going with this email. I kind of got off on a rant there. There's
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.880]  one more line left in this email. It says, that way the whole world can tune in to
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.680]  your expertise for cannabis knowledge. Hey, that would be awesome to get myself
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.240]  on the Joe Rogan experience, because he does say some things about cannabis that
[15:58.240 --> 16:01.560]  sometimes I'm like, dude, you need an expert. You need somebody to clear that
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.120]  up, because you just said some weird shit. I would like to be that guy. Hey guys,
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.160]  tweet Joe Rogan and tell him that Rasta Jeff hasn't eaten meat in 20 years, and
[16:09.400 --> 16:13.840]  that the only way I'm gonna break my streak is if Rogan either prepares and
[16:13.840 --> 16:18.000]  sends me some meat, or just sends me some meat with specific instructions on how
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.200]  to prepare it for myself. I think this could be a fun adventure. Alright, I'm
[16:22.200 --> 16:25.200]  not sure if you want your name said in this email, so hey dude, thanks for the
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.280]  great email. I appreciate it. You guys, if you would like to send me an email, my
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.120]  email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. I would love to hear from
