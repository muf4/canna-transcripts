[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Hey, welcome back everyone!
[00:01.720 --> 00:05.760]  It is time for episode 441 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.760 --> 00:09.600]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.600 --> 00:14.000]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.560]  you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:16.560 --> 00:22.680]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:22.680 --> 00:27.160]  Today I've been taking dabs of Blue Lemon Thai Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:27.160 --> 00:28.160]  Farms.
[00:28.160 --> 00:35.880]  The package says this product contains 67.7% THC and 78.5% total cannabinoids.
[00:35.880 --> 00:40.280]  I really love the flavor and aroma of the Blue Lemon Thai Ambrosia.
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.000]  It's got that blue lemon flavor.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.980]  I know that sounds ridiculous, but if I broke it open and gave you a smell, you would absolutely
[00:45.980 --> 00:49.400]  agree that that smells like blue lemons.
[00:49.400 --> 00:54.080]  So big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious and extremely potent
[00:54.080 --> 00:57.160]  Blue Lemon Thai Ambrosia.
[00:57.160 --> 01:00.920]  In this episode of the podcast, I would like to introduce you to a new strain called Orange
[01:00.920 --> 01:04.920]  Gasm, but before we get there, let's do some shout outs to some friends on Patreon.
[01:04.920 --> 01:09.720]  I want to give a huge Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my buddy Jacob W., a
[01:09.720 --> 01:15.040]  giant podcast shout out to Stabby McStabberson, as always a giant Viking handshake to my friend

[01:36.760 --> 01:40.560]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[01:40.560 --> 01:44.040]  All right, podcast world, at the start of the show, I said I was going to introduce
[01:44.040 --> 01:45.720]  you to a new strain.
[01:45.720 --> 01:47.840]  Let's talk about one of my newest creations.
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.080]  Let's talk about Orange Gasm.
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.360]  Orange Gasm is a cross of platinum tangy from our friends at the Garden of Weden, pollinated
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.880]  by a reversed golden goat.
[01:56.880 --> 02:00.400]  I took a female golden goat plant, I treated it with a solution.
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.420]  That solution caused that plant to create pollen sacs.
[02:04.420 --> 02:08.560]  Those pollen sacs contained pollen which only contain female chromosomes.
[02:08.560 --> 02:13.840]  I applied that female pollen onto the platinum tangy plant, and we have made Orange Gasm
[02:13.840 --> 02:15.940]  feminized seeds.
[02:15.940 --> 02:21.020]  My goal when I was creating Orange Gasm was to create a really orange and tangerine flavored
[02:21.020 --> 02:22.780]  feminized seed line.
[02:22.780 --> 02:24.660]  I really think I nailed it.
[02:24.660 --> 02:28.500]  What I got was that sweet orange tangerine creamsicle sort of a flavor.
[02:28.500 --> 02:33.300]  I brought that platinum tangy flowering time and platinum tangy growth pattern and structure
[02:33.300 --> 02:34.460]  into the cross.
[02:34.460 --> 02:38.780]  Then it also added that golden goat potency, a little bit of sweetness, and some of the
[02:38.780 --> 02:44.100]  phenotypes even bring out a grapefruit sort of flavor and aroma which comes from the golden
[02:44.100 --> 02:46.060]  goat side of things.
[02:46.060 --> 02:50.940]  So my main goal was to create a feminized seed that carried that delicious orange turp
[02:50.940 --> 02:51.940]  flavor.
[02:51.940 --> 02:56.140]  It looks like in the process I created a great structured plant that has a great flavor and
[02:56.140 --> 02:57.600]  tremendous potency.
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.900]  So let's talk more about the Orange Gasm.
[02:59.900 --> 03:02.860]  Let's start by talking about the parents of Orange Gasm.
[03:02.860 --> 03:06.700]  Orange Gasm is a cross of the platinum tangy and golden goat.
[03:06.700 --> 03:10.780]  Platinum tangy is of course a tangy male named Julius.
[03:10.780 --> 03:13.380]  Julius was selected by our friends at the Garden of Weden.
[03:13.380 --> 03:15.020]  Big shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[03:15.020 --> 03:19.460]  So they used Julius to pollinate a platinum cookies female.
[03:19.460 --> 03:24.900]  So they had the platinum Girl Scout cookies pollinated by Julius that made platinum tangy.
[03:24.900 --> 03:30.340]  Platinum tangy has a delicious greasy orange smell with a hint of that Girl Scout cookies
[03:30.340 --> 03:31.340]  background.
[03:31.340 --> 03:32.340]  There's something funky.
[03:32.340 --> 03:34.100]  There's something slightly spicy.
[03:34.100 --> 03:35.300]  There's something dirty to it.
[03:35.300 --> 03:39.420]  So it's like a greasy funky orange with a hint of armpits, maybe a little bit of skunk
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.420]  going on.
[03:40.420 --> 03:42.440]  I really appreciate the platinum tangy.
[03:42.500 --> 03:43.840]  It grows beautifully.
[03:43.840 --> 03:45.560]  It's got the greatest growth structure.
[03:45.560 --> 03:47.800]  That's one of my favorite things about it, the way that it grows.
[03:47.800 --> 03:52.560]  As a grower, as a commercial grower, platinum tangy always did a great job in the production
[03:52.560 --> 03:53.560]  rooms.
[03:53.560 --> 03:57.600]  It always helped me get bonuses and the flavors and aromas are unbeatable.
[03:57.600 --> 03:59.740]  It makes amazing concentrates.
[03:59.740 --> 04:02.120]  So then I paired that up with the golden goat.
[04:02.120 --> 04:04.560]  Let's talk about golden goat for a moment.
[04:04.560 --> 04:09.680]  Golden goat is a Hawaiian Romulan male that pollinated an Island sweet skunk female.
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.640]  So we've got a lot of great genetics in there.
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.600]  I see that Island sweet skunk come out a lot in the orange chasm phenotypes.
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.920]  That is what will bring out that pink grapefruit sort of aroma that comes from the Island sweet
[04:21.920 --> 04:23.080]  skunk.
[04:23.080 --> 04:26.960]  Golden goat was bred by a guy who's known as Mr. Dank and he is from Topeka, Kansas.
[04:26.960 --> 04:29.380]  I've done a full episode on golden goat.
[04:29.380 --> 04:33.360]  So if you would like to learn a lot about golden goat, I suggest checking out episode
[04:33.360 --> 04:35.800]  418 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.640]  That entire episode is heavily focused on golden goat.
[04:39.640 --> 04:42.520]  Golden goat brings a really delightful tropical smell.
[04:42.520 --> 04:43.720]  It has some citrus to it.
[04:43.720 --> 04:45.240]  It has hints of pineapple to it.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.580]  It has a beautiful growth structure.
[04:47.580 --> 04:49.560]  Golden goat always puts out huge harvests.
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.560]  And also I love the potency of golden goat.
[04:52.560 --> 04:57.440]  I have seen golden goat reach impressive lab test numbers, but also sometimes I have smoked
[04:57.440 --> 05:01.960]  a golden goat that didn't show impressive lab tests, but it blew me away when I smoked
[05:01.960 --> 05:02.960]  it.
[05:02.960 --> 05:04.280]  So there's something special about that golden goat.
[05:04.280 --> 05:06.320]  I have always been a big fan of golden goat.
[05:06.320 --> 05:10.520]  I've obviously fallen in love with it because you see it in a lot of my breeding.
[05:10.520 --> 05:12.840]  So I used a female golden goat clone.
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.440]  It was treated with a solution which made it create pollen sacks, which only contained
[05:17.440 --> 05:18.440]  female pollen.
[05:18.440 --> 05:20.880]  I applied that female pollen to the platinum tangy.
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.160]  We have now got the orange gasm seeds.
[05:23.160 --> 05:26.520]  Let's talk more specifically about the orange gasm.
[05:26.520 --> 05:32.920]  As a consumer, the first thing you are going to notice about orange gasm is the insanely
[05:32.920 --> 05:35.760]  intense pungent orange aroma.
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.760]  It is orangey.
[05:36.760 --> 05:38.000]  It is tangerines.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.620]  There are hints of grapefruit.
[05:39.620 --> 05:45.880]  It almost smells like somebody sprayed orange ozium in the room or directly into your face.
[05:45.880 --> 05:49.920]  It's like you were in a small compact car and somebody has got that orange ozium and
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.840]  they just won't keep spraying it.
[05:51.840 --> 05:55.440]  It smells like you cleaned the entire world with citrus cleaner.
[05:55.440 --> 05:58.560]  It carries a tremendous orange smell.
[05:58.560 --> 06:01.200]  It also kind of smells like tang powder.
[06:01.200 --> 06:05.960]  If you used to make tang back in the day, it's got that strong, overpowering, fake orange
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.960]  flavor in some phenotypes.
[06:07.960 --> 06:14.640]  Also, some phenotypes will have a really sweet, smooth, creamsicle sort of aroma and flavor.
[06:14.640 --> 06:21.720]  I really like the array of tangerine and sweet orange flavors that come from the orange gasm.
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.360]  One of the best things about orange gasm is the concentrates.
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.880]  If you are a concentrate maker of any type, you will find a beautiful phenotype of orange
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.680]  gasm for your concentrate production.
[06:32.680 --> 06:36.440]  There's a phenotype that works beautifully for ice water extraction.
[06:36.440 --> 06:39.400]  There's a phenotype that works beautifully to be pressed.
[06:39.400 --> 06:44.040]  Almost any of the phenotypes will make wonderful BHO extraction.
[06:44.040 --> 06:50.440]  All of them are going to smell like disgusting, delicious, potent, pungent, sweet oranges.
[06:50.440 --> 06:54.160]  I can't talk enough about the orange flavor that comes from orange gasm, you guys.
[06:54.160 --> 06:58.680]  I'm going to say oranges in this episode 3,000 times because that is the only thing I can
[06:58.840 --> 07:01.360]  think of when I smell these flowers.
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.400]  Now we know that it tastes and smells like oranges.
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.400]  I've said that enough.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.740]  Let's talk about growing orange gasm.
[07:06.740 --> 07:09.320]  Orange gasm is very easy to grow.
[07:09.320 --> 07:13.240]  It has a very nice growth structure and shape.
[07:13.240 --> 07:17.520]  One good thing about the orange gasm in comparison to most of the crosses I make is it does not
[07:17.520 --> 07:19.560]  get ridiculously tall.
[07:19.560 --> 07:25.160]  It will get tall, but it will not be a gigantic, stretchy plant like most of my other crosses.
[07:25.160 --> 07:27.020]  This one stays a little bit shorter.
[07:27.020 --> 07:31.100]  It takes on a very nice Christmas tree type of a shape, but then it creates what I call
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.100]  a menorah.
[07:32.100 --> 07:34.060]  It makes a lot of even length branches.
[07:34.060 --> 07:36.380]  You don't have one big tall top glory bud.
[07:36.380 --> 07:38.980]  You get a nice even canopy out of the orange gasm.
[07:38.980 --> 07:40.420]  I really enjoy that.
[07:40.420 --> 07:42.860]  It makes it great for sea of green type of growing.
[07:42.860 --> 07:48.060]  It makes it great for large commercial production, and it is a wonderful plant for outdoor growing.
[07:48.060 --> 07:51.100]  I really love the structure and the shape.
[07:51.100 --> 07:53.220]  It also is really stout.
[07:53.220 --> 07:56.140]  It makes thick stalks and branches.
[07:56.260 --> 08:00.420]  I like to do a lot of popping and twisting and super cropping, and this one really takes
[08:00.420 --> 08:04.820]  it well because the branches start off very thick and very stout.
[08:04.820 --> 08:07.980]  If you're growing in windy conditions or if you need to put some plants at the end of
[08:07.980 --> 08:12.660]  a row where a fan kind of beats them up a little bit, orange gasm may be a perfect candidate
[08:12.660 --> 08:14.180]  for that type of environment.
[08:14.180 --> 08:18.480]  The stalks are so big, the branches are so stout that I don't worry about the wind whipping
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.380]  the shit out of this plant.
[08:20.380 --> 08:24.180]  If it does whip the shit out of it, if it does get beat up a little bit, orange gasm
[08:24.180 --> 08:26.020]  can take a lot of abuse.
[08:26.020 --> 08:27.820]  It's a very hardy plant.
[08:27.820 --> 08:30.700]  The platinum tangy that I used is a very hardy plant.
[08:30.700 --> 08:34.720]  We have beat the shit out of it in many different ways in commercial environments, and it never
[08:34.720 --> 08:35.940]  shows me any stress.
[08:35.940 --> 08:37.700]  It's always just like, hey, I'm over here growing.
[08:37.700 --> 08:40.100]  I'm doing exactly what you need me to do.
[08:40.100 --> 08:41.660]  And then golden goat is the same.
[08:41.660 --> 08:42.660]  It is very vigorous.
[08:42.660 --> 08:44.340]  It has a lot of energy.
[08:44.340 --> 08:48.020]  So crossing these two created a very energetic plant.
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.060]  So it grows quite quickly in veg and in flower.
[08:51.060 --> 08:52.060]  You'll see a lot of growth.
[08:52.060 --> 08:54.880]  It'll get very robust, fat stalks.
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.480]  You may want to transplant more early than you were used to if you were growing the orange
[08:58.480 --> 08:59.760]  gasm.
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.720]  It does, like I said before, it likes being popped and twisted and it enjoys being topped.
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.520]  However, you may not need to top it too much because it does grow that menorah type of
[09:09.520 --> 09:12.760]  a shape where it's got a bunch of arms that all reach up to the same level.
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.780]  It may get one kind of one dominant bud, but it's not going to get a big giant glory cola
[09:17.780 --> 09:19.440]  in many phenotypes.
[09:19.440 --> 09:23.520]  The golden goat dominant phenotype will show you that glory cola, but more of your platinum
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.560]  tangy dominant phenotypes aren't going to have that giant stretch on the top bud.
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.080]  That perfect growth structure makes orange gasm really easy to trellis.
[09:33.080 --> 09:36.600]  If you're going to throw her in a large commercial facility or if you're going to put her in
[09:36.600 --> 09:39.280]  a tent, she likes to be worked into a net.
[09:39.280 --> 09:42.800]  A lot of times people like to really work the branches into the net and spread them
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.800]  out.
[09:43.800 --> 09:45.720]  Orange gasm doesn't need a lot of help to spread.
[09:45.720 --> 09:47.880]  It kind of spreads wide on its own.
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.200]  What you will need is a little bit of support.
[09:50.320 --> 09:54.440]  Both of these parents are heavy producers, so the offspring are obviously going to be
[09:54.440 --> 09:55.960]  large producing plants.
[09:55.960 --> 09:59.520]  You're going to get big buds throughout the entire grow room.
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.280]  So be ready, have some supports, have some tomato cages, have some sort of trellising
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.240]  going on, but these plants really do appreciate some trellising and some scrogging and some
[10:08.240 --> 10:09.320]  sort of supports.
[10:09.320 --> 10:12.720]  They also take very well to defoliating.
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.320]  The platinum tangy dominant phenotypes won't require heavy defoliation, but the golden
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.840]  goat phenotypes will take very well to semi-heavy defoliation.
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.920]  That brings us to another good point, the calyx to leaf ratio.
[10:26.920 --> 10:30.160]  Many phenotypes of the orange gasm are not very leafy.
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.520]  A lot of them will have a very long petiole with a very big fan leaf coming off of it
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.920]  and not a lot of small leaves.
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.920]  That is known as a good calyx to leaf ratio.
[10:39.920 --> 10:40.920]  That makes it easy to trim.
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.640]  It makes it easy to defoliate.
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.600]  And while the plant is growing, that gives less opportunity and potential for pests and
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.600]  mildew.
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.280]  There are less places for bugs to hide and less places for powdery mildew to cling on,
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.120]  so it gives us less potential for problems.
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.280]  That does make orange gasm a great strain for beginners.
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.880]  If you were a new grower, I highly recommend orange gasm.
[11:02.880 --> 11:05.280]  The platinum tangy is really easy to grow.
[11:05.280 --> 11:11.200]  The golden goat is very easy to grow, and the orange gasm is even simpler to grow, in
[11:11.200 --> 11:12.680]  my opinion.
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.700]  Orange gasm is only available in female seeds, so that saves one more step.
[11:16.700 --> 11:21.600]  You don't have to search out the males, making it even easier for beginner growers.
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.880]  Orange gasm is also a great strain for outdoor growers in some locations.
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.020]  Some phenotypes of orange gasm will finish as early as 56 to 60 days.
[11:32.020 --> 11:35.360]  Some phenotypes will take as long as 70 days.
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.440]  If you've got one of those earlier finishing phenotypes, they do beautifully outside.
[11:39.440 --> 11:43.520]  They don't have a lot of problems because of that wonderful calyx to leaf ratio.
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.920]  I've noticed that the orange gasm does very well in high heat conditions.
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.440]  So if you're growing in a hot outdoor environment, orange gasm will do very well for you.
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.840]  It tolerates high heat.
[11:55.840 --> 12:00.260]  Another great thing about the orange gasm is it takes errors very well.
[12:00.260 --> 12:04.900]  If you make a mistake, orange gasm is not going to show you immediately that it is completely
[12:04.900 --> 12:05.900]  pissed off.
[12:05.900 --> 12:09.940]  If you're growing some sour diesel type stuff, if you're growing an OG Kush plant and you
[12:09.940 --> 12:13.300]  mess up with one feeding, you are going to pay for that in the end.
[12:13.300 --> 12:15.260]  Your harvest will not be what you expected.
[12:15.260 --> 12:17.460]  The quality may not be what you expected.
[12:17.460 --> 12:21.540]  When you are growing orange gasm, you have a lot of room for mistakes.
[12:21.540 --> 12:23.740]  She is a very forgiving plant.
[12:23.740 --> 12:27.580]  Now that is a good way to segue into talking about feeding orange gasm.
[12:27.580 --> 12:30.500]  She is very easy to feed and get dialed in.
[12:30.500 --> 12:33.220]  She likes a lot of nutrients.
[12:33.220 --> 12:39.460]  She will go macro nutrient deficient early in flower if you don't boost up the NPK.
[12:39.460 --> 12:44.500]  Most of our cannabis plants do absorb 90% of their nitrogen through their veg phase.
[12:44.500 --> 12:48.500]  Make sure you do not let these plants get nitrogen deficient.
[12:48.500 --> 12:50.180]  You will not catch up.
[12:50.180 --> 12:54.100]  So the main thing to look for when you're growing orange gasm is to watch for nutrient
[12:54.100 --> 12:58.140]  deficiencies or nutrient burns and get that dialed in.
[12:58.140 --> 13:02.680]  The thinner leaved golden goat phenotypes are going to show you that they are experiencing
[13:03.140 --> 13:08.200]  nutrient burn before you see it pop up in the larger leaved platinum tangy dominant
[13:08.200 --> 13:09.200]  phenotypes.
[13:09.200 --> 13:11.160]  So pay attention to that skinny leaf.
[13:11.160 --> 13:14.880]  If you see it starting to get its nails done, you can tell that you're probably giving it
[13:14.880 --> 13:16.780]  a little bit too much nutrient.
[13:16.780 --> 13:21.120]  If that skinny leaf phenotype is starting to get a little bit pale, it probably needs
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.200]  more nutrients.
[13:22.200 --> 13:24.680]  Pay attention to those skinny leaved phenotypes.
[13:24.680 --> 13:28.880]  They are going to give you hints before the larger leaved phenotypes.
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.280]  I've mentioned it briefly before, but most phenotypes of orange gasm are going to flower
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.200]  from somewhere between 60 and 70 days.
[13:38.200 --> 13:39.740]  Some of them may finish earlier.
[13:39.740 --> 13:42.560]  Some of them may finish closer to the 56 day mark.
[13:42.560 --> 13:44.720]  I would rather not set that expectation.
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.700]  I would rather say 60 to 70 days to be honest with you.
[13:48.700 --> 13:53.260]  You may get some outliers that go two to four days longer each direction, but you can generally
[13:53.260 --> 13:56.360]  rely on that 60 to 70 day timeline.
[13:56.360 --> 14:01.000]  It may be easier to tell early in flower with the orange gasm, which phenotypes will
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.680]  go longer because of the two parents I used.
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.920]  The skinnier leafed phenotypes are going to take closer to 70 days.
[14:07.920 --> 14:09.560]  That is a golden goat dominant phenotype.
[14:09.560 --> 14:11.480]  It is more sativa dominant.
[14:11.480 --> 14:13.580]  That will need to go a little bit longer.
[14:13.580 --> 14:19.160]  The wider platinum tangy dominant leaves, that phenotype will probably finish closer
[14:19.160 --> 14:20.840]  to the 60 day mark.
[14:20.840 --> 14:23.320]  So pay attention to the leaf size, the leaf shape.
[14:23.320 --> 14:25.800]  That will indicate to you how long to go.
[14:25.800 --> 14:31.720]  The first time you run these, I suggest going 70 full days in flower if you've got the opportunity.
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.440]  Now that feels like a good way to segue into talking about expected phenotypes.
[14:36.440 --> 14:41.560]  I've seen several different phenotypes pop up from the orange gasm.
[14:41.560 --> 14:48.120]  Most of them very closely resemble the platinum tangy and the golden goat, but I do feel like
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.940]  I have seen some island sweet skunk dominant phenotypes pop up in the mix.
[14:53.940 --> 14:58.820]  Some of the common phenotypes you can expect to see are the golden goat dominant phenotype.
[14:58.820 --> 15:01.220]  This one grows very much like golden goat.
[15:01.220 --> 15:07.620]  It has got very long, skinny and pointy leaves, and it makes very pine cone shaped top buds.
[15:07.620 --> 15:13.000]  It's got a very tropical kind of a pineapple-y and citrus sort of aroma to it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.960]  Sometimes that one will bring out a little bit of a grapefruit smell.
[15:15.960 --> 15:19.700]  That does come from the island sweet skunk, which we'll talk about in a minute.
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.460]  There is another phenotype that obviously is platinum tangy dominant.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.860]  That is the one with big, wide, fat leaves.
[15:26.860 --> 15:32.340]  Sometimes the platinum tangy dominant phenotype will produce purple stems.
[15:32.340 --> 15:36.980]  It does not make a lot of purple leaf and purple bud, but it will make purple stems.
[15:36.980 --> 15:42.620]  That is a great way to see the platinum tangy dominant phenotype early in your growth.
[15:42.620 --> 15:47.100]  A really great phenotype that you are going to find in packs of orange gasm is a phenotype
[15:47.100 --> 15:50.100]  that I have named the mean girl or the jagged girl.
[15:50.340 --> 15:54.340]  A long time ago, I made another cross called heart of gold, and it had a phenotype that
[15:54.340 --> 15:55.820]  I called the mean girl.
[15:55.820 --> 15:57.580]  It was another golden goat cross.
[15:57.580 --> 16:01.260]  I see this same trait coming up in the orange gasm.
[16:01.260 --> 16:05.300]  Some of these phenotypes produce a bud that just looks mean.
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.740]  The buds are really jagged.
[16:06.740 --> 16:08.340]  The leaves are really serrated.
[16:08.340 --> 16:12.700]  It's got a really tight structure to it, and it just looks like it would be really mean,
[16:12.700 --> 16:14.220]  or it looks like it could be weaponized.
[16:14.220 --> 16:16.040]  I just call it the mean girl phenotype.
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.660]  It looks like it's probably got a switchblade.
[16:18.660 --> 16:23.540]  That phenotype grows a little bit more like the golden goat, but it carries that delicious,
[16:23.540 --> 16:28.660]  sweet platinum tangy aroma, so I really love the mean girl phenotype.
[16:28.660 --> 16:30.700]  It is a little bit airier.
[16:30.700 --> 16:36.300]  The buds aren't as tight and compact and dense as some of the platinum tangy dominant phenotypes,
[16:36.300 --> 16:39.540]  but if you've listened to the podcast for a while, I'm sure you've heard me say that
[16:39.540 --> 16:44.300]  I think airy buds are going to be the future for concentrate production.
[16:44.300 --> 16:46.740]  I feel like you have more surface area for trichomes.
[16:46.820 --> 16:51.500]  I feel like it's a little bit easier to extract something off of a fluffier, airier bud than
[16:51.500 --> 16:57.580]  it is a tighter, more dense bud, so I feel like this one is great for concentrate production.
[16:57.580 --> 17:02.260]  Sometimes you will see that the mean girl phenotype creates what I call a taco leaf.
[17:02.260 --> 17:05.860]  The leaf will curl up, kind of looks like a canoe, kind of looks like a taco shell.
[17:05.860 --> 17:07.060]  It just folds in half.
[17:07.060 --> 17:11.540]  A lot of times, people will think that that is a result of excessive heat.
[17:11.540 --> 17:15.620]  Sometimes that is the issue, but that is just a common trait that you will see happen in
[17:15.620 --> 17:18.700]  the mean girl phenotype of orangegasm.
[17:18.700 --> 17:22.260]  That phenotype is going to extract very well.
[17:22.260 --> 17:27.320]  That phenotype is going to have one of the most intense orange flavors and aromas that
[17:27.320 --> 17:29.020]  I have ever bred.
[17:29.020 --> 17:31.020]  So that is the mean girl phenotype.
[17:31.020 --> 17:34.580]  That is probably the one I would look for if you're making concentrates.
[17:34.580 --> 17:39.780]  If you are going for potency, you may go for more of the golden goat dominant leaning phenotypes.
[17:39.780 --> 17:43.380]  If you're going for that orange flavor, of course, go for those wider-leaved platinum
[17:43.380 --> 17:45.500]  tangy dominant phenotypes.
[17:45.580 --> 17:49.220]  Now there is one phenotype that I call the outlier.
[17:49.220 --> 17:50.220]  She is ugly.
[17:50.220 --> 17:51.700]  It is really tall.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.380]  It is really thin.
[17:53.380 --> 17:54.800]  It's a little bit wispy.
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.560]  It's kind of stretchy.
[17:56.560 --> 18:00.260]  She produces fairly well, but not as well as the other phenotypes.
[18:00.260 --> 18:04.100]  But what she does do is she is encrusted in trichomes.
[18:04.100 --> 18:07.980]  There is no room for more resin on those tiny buds.
[18:07.980 --> 18:14.700]  And when you dry it and cure it and smoke it, the flavor is like disgusting, sour, tart
[18:14.900 --> 18:15.900]  grapefruit.
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.700]  And it is so pungent and weird that it made my mouth pucker just thinking about it right
[18:20.700 --> 18:21.700]  now.
[18:21.700 --> 18:27.740]  If you are into pink grapefruit or pink lemonade and grapefruit sort of aromas, that phenotype
[18:27.740 --> 18:29.380]  may be the one for you.
[18:29.380 --> 18:34.420]  I feel like that phenotype came from the island sweet skunk parent from the golden goat.
[18:34.420 --> 18:38.560]  So we are seeing things way down the line pop out in this cross.
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.220]  When this phenotype pops up, if you've paid attention, you will know it.
[18:42.220 --> 18:44.620]  It is immediately the tallest phenotype.
[18:44.660 --> 18:48.140]  It is the one with the branches that are trying to all keep up with each other and they are
[18:48.140 --> 18:50.460]  all stretching in competition.
[18:50.460 --> 18:53.980]  A lot of people may want to cull this phenotype immediately.
[18:53.980 --> 18:56.940]  If you are into grapefruits, this is the one for you.
[18:56.940 --> 19:02.980]  It will produce okay, but the potency and the flavors are going to be off the charts.
[19:02.980 --> 19:06.540]  So if you're growing just for yourself and you're into that sweet grapefruit sort of
[19:06.540 --> 19:12.500]  a flavor, I really hope that you are the one that finds this semi-rare ugly phenotype of
[19:12.500 --> 19:13.500]  the orange chasm.
[19:13.820 --> 19:16.100]  Now let's talk about the one that everybody is going to want.
[19:16.100 --> 19:18.140]  I call it the 50-50.
[19:18.140 --> 19:19.860]  It's probably obvious why I call it that.
[19:19.860 --> 19:23.780]  It is 50% golden goat and it is 50% platinum tangy.
[19:23.780 --> 19:27.600]  And we got the best half of each one for this phenotype.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.540]  It carries a tremendous sweet orange flavor.
[19:30.540 --> 19:35.300]  It has got that perfect, the golden goat stretch, but then it's also got that platinum tangy
[19:35.300 --> 19:36.500]  menorah shape.
[19:36.500 --> 19:39.260]  And then it carries the potency of the golden goat.
[19:39.260 --> 19:42.740]  That phenotype tends to finish up right around 63 days.
[19:42.740 --> 19:46.860]  If you were growing this strain in a commercial facility, that is the phenotype that you want.
[19:46.860 --> 19:47.860]  That is perfect.
[19:47.860 --> 19:48.860]  It puts out great weight.
[19:48.860 --> 19:51.000]  It puts out great flavors and aromas.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.900]  And the bag appeal on the finished dried and cured buds is beautiful.
[19:54.900 --> 19:59.460]  The buds are bright green, the pistils dry up and they stay bright orange and it creates
[19:59.460 --> 20:00.520]  great bag appeal.
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.060]  So that 50-50 phenotype is perfect if you were growing for commercial production.
[20:05.060 --> 20:06.060]  All right.
[20:06.060 --> 20:09.940]  Another thing I should mention about the orange chasm is temperature.
[20:09.940 --> 20:14.760]  Many growers like to lower the temperature of their flowering room late in flower to
[20:14.760 --> 20:18.060]  bring out the colors of their flowers.
[20:18.060 --> 20:21.860]  This is not necessary with orange chasm.
[20:21.860 --> 20:27.660]  I have not seen any benefits to reducing the temperatures of the grow room late in flower
[20:27.660 --> 20:30.040]  when growing orange chasm.
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.220]  Orange chasm seems to prefer higher temperatures and I have not seen any advantage to reducing
[20:35.220 --> 20:37.140]  the temperature late in flower.
[20:37.140 --> 20:39.140]  I have not seen any improved color.
[20:39.140 --> 20:41.740]  I have not seen any speed up in flowering time.
[20:41.740 --> 20:45.860]  I really think that it is best just to leave the room just like it is and continue flowering
[20:45.860 --> 20:48.080]  until the end with orange chasm.
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.080]  Don't make it cooler.
[20:49.080 --> 20:50.080]  Don't reduce the lights.
[20:50.080 --> 20:51.080]  Don't do any tricks.
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.540]  Just keep it just like it is.
[20:52.540 --> 20:56.700]  It tends to like it fairly warm, so keep it warm all the way through flower.
[20:56.700 --> 20:58.260]  Don't worry about reducing the temps.
[20:58.260 --> 21:00.200]  Don't try to get it cold late in the cycle.
[21:00.200 --> 21:01.700]  That is not necessary.
[21:01.700 --> 21:07.060]  Now that may be really advantageous for people who are growing large facilities or running
[21:07.060 --> 21:08.900]  perpetual cycles.
[21:08.940 --> 21:12.260]  Sometimes you might want to reduce the temperature in your grow room so that you can get that
[21:12.260 --> 21:14.460]  one strain to finish earlier.
[21:14.460 --> 21:17.860]  Sometimes reducing the temperature late in flower will bring out some great colors.
[21:17.860 --> 21:19.860]  Sometimes it makes the plants dense up a little bit.
[21:19.860 --> 21:23.540]  I have noticed that that does not work for the orange chasm.
[21:23.540 --> 21:25.660]  She likes it warm all the way through.
[21:25.660 --> 21:30.900]  All right, so I think that covers all of the grow details of orange chasm.
[21:30.900 --> 21:33.800]  Let's talk a little bit about smoking orange chasm.
[21:33.800 --> 21:38.840]  Orange chasm is a delight to smoke, of course, because those tremendous orange and tangerine
[21:38.840 --> 21:40.600]  and sweet candied orange flavors.
[21:40.600 --> 21:46.480]  But what I really like about it is the really good mood and great vibe that I get from smoking
[21:46.480 --> 21:47.640]  orange chasm.
[21:47.640 --> 21:51.720]  It doesn't completely obliterate my brain to where I can't think and can't focus, but
[21:51.720 --> 21:53.560]  it does put me in a really good mood.
[21:53.560 --> 21:55.400]  It just puts a smile on your face.
[21:55.400 --> 21:59.280]  If you're having a rough morning, if you've had a shitty day, smoke a little orange chasm.
[21:59.280 --> 22:00.800]  You will be smiling.
[22:00.800 --> 22:02.320]  I call it the O face.
[22:02.320 --> 22:05.440]  You'll smoke a little and you go, oh, you just blow out your smoke.
[22:05.440 --> 22:08.020]  Your mouth tastes like oranges and your stress goes away.
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.240]  Your shoulders relax.
[22:09.240 --> 22:10.520]  You feel better.
[22:10.520 --> 22:14.880]  Another thing that I have noticed is that it works great for people with anxiety.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.400]  If you are experiencing anxiety or if you want to keep the anxiety away, smoking the
[22:19.400 --> 22:21.880]  orange chasm will chill you the fuck out.
[22:21.880 --> 22:23.060]  It puts you in a good mood.
[22:23.060 --> 22:24.540]  It makes you forget that you are anxious.
[22:24.540 --> 22:26.720]  It makes you forget that you were worried about something.
[22:26.720 --> 22:29.920]  And it just puts a little pep in your step and puts you in a good vibe.
[22:29.920 --> 22:33.400]  I really think orange chasm would make great morning medicine.
[22:33.400 --> 22:36.440]  If you're a person who likes to medicate in the morning, but you still want to be able
[22:36.440 --> 22:39.160]  to function, you don't want your brain to get too blown away.
[22:39.160 --> 22:42.300]  You don't want to get too lazy, but you want to put a little pep in your step and lively
[22:42.300 --> 22:43.380]  up the vibe.
[22:43.380 --> 22:45.680]  That is where orange chasm fits in perfectly.
[22:45.680 --> 22:47.320]  All right, podcast world.
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.080]  That is all of the information I have got for you on orange chasm.
[22:50.080 --> 22:53.000]  If you have any more questions, I do encourage you to ask me.

[24:58.560 --> 25:00.240]  Come join us on Cannabuzz.

[25:04.760 --> 25:07.800]  Post the picture to Cannabuzz and say, what's wrong with my plant?
[25:07.800 --> 25:12.400]  Folks like myself and other experienced growers will chime in and give you helpful advice,
[25:12.400 --> 25:15.720]  and we will help correct the issues you are having with your plants.
[25:15.720 --> 25:16.720]  Join us on Cannabuzz.
[25:16.720 --> 25:18.120]  I look forward to seeing you over there.

[25:33.280 --> 25:36.960]  If you're not into all that social media nonsense, you can send me an email.
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.800]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com, and I do look forward to hearing from you.
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.840]  If you have sent me an email and I haven't gotten to it yet, please do not feel discouraged.
[25:46.840 --> 25:49.280]  I have got a mountain of emails in front of me.
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.440]  I can only get through so many in so many episodes, but your email is coming up.
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.440]  Just be patient.
[25:54.440 --> 25:55.440]  Do not get discouraged.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.240]  I will get your advice to you very soon.
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.800]  Don't forget to check out that new drop on 710.
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.320]  I look forward to seeing all of my friends at the Dude Groves Concentration Celebration
[26:07.320 --> 26:08.320]  on 713.
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.840]  And I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back in just a few days with fresh new content.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.760]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend AZ Cushman.
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.200]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
