[00:12.030 --> 00:23.190]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 102 of the Grow From Your
[00:23.190 --> 00:28.830]  Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.830 --> 00:32.190]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[00:32.190 --> 00:35.930]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:35.930 --> 00:40.490]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends
[00:40.490 --> 00:44.190]  call me Rasta Jeff. Sitting across the table from me today is our good buddy, White Mike.
[00:44.190 --> 00:48.130]  How you doing, bro? I'm doing well, man. How are you? I am great, dude. I may have
[00:48.130 --> 00:51.610]  fallen asleep on the couch for a couple hours. So when you got here, I may have been a little
[00:51.610 --> 00:55.230]  bit groggy, but I think I've got my shit together by now. Naps are good for your health. Naps
[00:55.230 --> 00:58.430]  are really good for you. Take a bunch of dabs, eat a bunch of food, and then you wake up
[00:58.430 --> 01:03.590]  on the couch wondering where time went. Right. Feeling all refreshed. We're good. We're back
[01:03.590 --> 01:07.550]  in the game. So I'm doing great, man. Thanks for coming today, bro. Yeah, happy to. Happy
[01:07.550 --> 01:10.350]  to. I think the listeners like having you on because we get a lot of listens when you're
[01:10.350 --> 01:14.790]  here. Nice. You guys, before we get too far, I wanted to give a big thank you shout out
[01:14.790 --> 01:18.990]  to the Mystic Roots band. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. They
[01:18.990 --> 01:22.490]  let me play their music on my show. They don't ask me for anything in return. That's super
[01:22.490 --> 01:27.150]  kind of them. Make sure you guys support Mystic Roots. In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is
[01:27.150 --> 01:30.870]  the most beautiful woman in reggae. So make sure you check that out. Big shout out to
[01:30.870 --> 01:36.150]  the Mystic Roots. Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots band. Shout out. So we've got some cool
[01:36.150 --> 01:41.590]  shit lined up today to talk about. But first, I want to kind of brag about my good ass weekend.
[01:41.590 --> 01:46.910]  Thursday, I think I recorded since this Thursday, I saw Israel Vibration, right? Yeah, we talked
[01:46.910 --> 01:51.750]  about that. So Saturday, my phone is too close to the recording equipment. It's making weird
[01:51.750 --> 01:56.390]  noises. Just go and throw that across the damn room. There we go. Saturday. Yeah, by
[01:56.390 --> 02:01.990]  phone. Get out of here. We don't need you for a minute. Saturday, we, I went up to Comedy
[02:01.990 --> 02:08.190]  Works to go see our good friend Doug Benson again for probably the 15th or 20th ish time.
[02:08.190 --> 02:12.770]  I went to work full disclosure. Well, thanks for keeping the shop on lock and holding everything
[02:12.770 --> 02:17.870]  down while Rasta Jeff was up seeing Doug Benson. Somebody got a hustle. Yeah, that's the truth.
[02:17.870 --> 02:21.470]  So I didn't have anybody to go with me Saturday. I thought I had some plans. They didn't work
[02:21.470 --> 02:26.190]  out the person I wanted to go with me was unable to go Saturday. So I went up there
[02:26.190 --> 02:30.990]  and I had two tickets. And I walked up to the line and there was another dude by himself
[02:30.990 --> 02:35.230]  walking up to the line looked kind of confused, holding like his printed ticket and shit.
[02:35.230 --> 02:37.950]  I could tell he was a noob to Comedy Works that he'd never been there and he was trying
[02:37.950 --> 02:42.110]  to figure out the Comedy Works lifestyle. So I watched him fumble around and I started
[02:42.110 --> 02:45.630]  conversation with him. He lit up a blunt we smoked a blunt there in the part in the line
[02:45.630 --> 02:50.030]  at Comedy Works. And then he goes, man, he asked me a question about Comedy Works. I
[02:50.030 --> 02:52.750]  don't remember what he said specifically. And I go, Oh, no worries, man, you could totally
[02:52.750 --> 02:57.230]  do that here. You'll be just fine. And as we walked in, he went to get his ticket and
[02:57.230 --> 02:59.550]  I go, man, you don't even need your ticket. You're gonna sit with me tonight. He goes,
[02:59.550 --> 03:02.350]  what? And I go, you want to sit front row, bro? And he goes, no, you're shitting me.
[03:02.350 --> 03:06.590]  And I go, yeah, man, I got two front row passes. Let's go sit in the front row. And so anybody
[03:06.590 --> 03:10.110]  that knows me that listens to the show, I'm going to brag a little bit. I've got two lifetime
[03:10.830 --> 03:14.270]  preferred seating passes for Comedy Works in downtown Denver. All I've got to do is let
[03:14.270 --> 03:18.990]  them know that I'm coming and I will be seated in seat 12, which is the front two seats right
[03:18.990 --> 03:22.910]  there in front of the stage, right where the comedians are spitting and drooling and sweating
[03:22.910 --> 03:25.790]  and staring you in the face and making fun of you and putting you in part of the show.
[03:26.030 --> 03:30.990]  The be part of the show section is how I like to think of it. Yeah. I get, I get made fun of every
[03:30.990 --> 03:36.190]  time I sit there. If it can, if I sit there, so it's great. So, uh, I take this brand new stranger
[03:36.830 --> 03:41.790]  in the front row, huge dreadlocks and huge cheesy smile. Yeah. They love me down there in the front.
[03:41.790 --> 03:45.230]  They'll love to make fun of me. So I took this new dude that I'd never met until that day. He
[03:45.230 --> 03:48.830]  was having kind of a bad day up until then. I was like, bro, just come with me. We'll go sit front
[03:48.830 --> 03:52.430]  row. And he sat front row and he had the time of his fucking life, dude. He laughed his ass off.
[03:52.430 --> 03:55.710]  He gave me a hug and shit at the end of the night. He's like, bro, that was so cool. Thank you.
[03:56.350 --> 03:59.950]  Shout out to my buddy Merlin. If you're listening, bro, it was good meeting you, man. That was a good
[03:59.950 --> 04:05.390]  time. So after the show, we go meet Doug Benson. I get stoned, uh, hang out with Doug Benson.
[04:05.390 --> 04:09.390]  Actually, it was really cool because it was a Doug loves movies podcast and Harlan Williams
[04:09.390 --> 04:15.070]  was a fucking guest. Harlan is one of my favorite comedians. That was fucking awesome. Pete Davidson
[04:15.070 --> 04:20.190]  or Davison from Saturday night live was another guest and Doug's friend and a comedian I've seen
[04:20.190 --> 04:25.230]  several times. Jeff Tate was the third guest. Nice. So, uh, hung out and got stoned with, uh,
[04:25.230 --> 04:29.150]  Jeff Tate doesn't smoke pot, but he hung out with us and Doug Benson definitely smoked.
[04:29.150 --> 04:32.590]  I got stoned with a whole bunch of cool ass people in the crowd. And then I drove back to Pueblo.
[04:32.590 --> 04:36.430]  Actually I ate at the mellow mushroom and then I was still hungry. So I also ate at the Chiba hut
[04:36.430 --> 04:41.390]  because I'm a pothead and I'm a fat fuck. So that shit was delicious. Drove home. And when you're
[04:41.390 --> 04:45.070]  in food country, you got to stop and get some. Yeah. When you drive past both of those restaurants,
[04:45.070 --> 04:48.510]  you're like, well, I'm eating here. There's just no stopping it. Shout out to my friend, Tiffany
[04:48.590 --> 04:51.550]  over at the mellow mushroom. Thanks for a delicious meal. That was awesome. He took good
[04:51.550 --> 04:57.150]  care of me. Great waitressing. I like it. Uh, so Saturday, uh, Sunday did it all over again. I had
[04:57.150 --> 05:01.230]  a beautiful date Sunday. She was able to go with me. Sunday went up there and saw Doug Benson do
[05:01.230 --> 05:06.350]  standup comedy. He tore it the fuck up. That was amazing. Uh, he made fun of me a little bit both
[05:06.350 --> 05:11.790]  nights. So that was cool. Uh, two days of Doug Benson hanging out with Doug Benson. The second
[05:11.790 --> 05:18.510]  night he treated me, it was not even like some celebrity and his fan hanging out. Jeff Tate
[05:18.510 --> 05:23.550]  walked up to me and asked me a question. He had a question for me because I, I was part of the show.
[05:23.550 --> 05:27.870]  At the end of the show, they play games and, uh, they play a game called the last man, Stanton.
[05:27.870 --> 05:32.990]  The thing is, uh, somebody in the audience names an actor and then the participants in the game
[05:32.990 --> 05:37.310]  have to name movies that that actor has been in until they run out. You know, we just keep going
[05:37.310 --> 05:41.790]  back and forth until one of us can't do it no more. And so, uh, Doug knew that I listened to
[05:41.790 --> 05:45.070]  the podcast. So he's like, Ross to Jeff will definitely have a name for us. We'll go to him
[05:45.070 --> 05:48.750]  for a name in just a minute. So he let me give him the name. And when it came time to it, I said,
[05:48.750 --> 05:51.310]  I have two names in my head. Do you want me to give you two of them? And he picked one. He goes,
[05:51.310 --> 05:54.910]  nope, just give me one and we'll do it. And I was like, all right. So the name I gave them for the
[05:54.910 --> 05:59.950]  game was, uh, Philip Seymour Hoffman, because I mean, he's got a lot of fucking movies and they
[05:59.950 --> 06:03.550]  should know a lot of them. So it was really good. They liked it. They had a lot of fun with it.
[06:03.550 --> 06:07.230]  So after the show, uh, Jeff Tate walked up and he's like, who was your other name, bro?
[06:07.230 --> 06:10.990]  And it's funny because I always forget the guy's fucking name. And I had it like in my head,
[06:10.990 --> 06:14.510]  right at that moment for when he asked what I had forgotten it. Cause I knew my time was up and I
[06:14.510 --> 06:18.270]  go, I forgot, dude. And he goes, Oh, you know, and I go, yeah, but I always forget his name.
[06:18.270 --> 06:22.910]  And I said, he played the president in mocking. And before I could say mocking Jay goes, Oh,
[06:22.910 --> 06:27.390]  fucking Donald Sutherland, dude. And hit me on the shoulder. So that dude knows his fucking movies.
[06:27.390 --> 06:31.070]  Jeff Tate knows his movies real well. Shout out to Jeff Tate. They made me feel like a friend.
[06:31.310 --> 06:36.030]  Those guys treat me like I am a homie. Now, when I walk through comedy works, I get high fives.
[06:36.030 --> 06:38.670]  Uh, they don't even walk me to my seat anymore. They're like, you're, you know, where your
[06:38.670 --> 06:43.310]  fucking seat is. Go have a seat. Enjoy your night. Right? Yeah. Dude. Comedy works is awesome. I used
[06:43.310 --> 06:50.590]  to go there a lot in college. That's, uh, I'm, I love going to music shows, but some music crowds
[06:50.590 --> 06:55.150]  are assholes. Yep. The crowds have evolved into assholes that want to shove their way to the front
[06:55.150 --> 06:58.430]  and spill their beer on you and just be a disrespectful Dick and don't appreciate the
[06:58.430 --> 07:02.110]  show. And they kind of ruined some concerts for me. I started enjoying sitting in the back and
[07:02.110 --> 07:06.190]  getting high as shit a long time ago, right? Yeah. Concerts are getting different as I'm getting
[07:06.190 --> 07:09.950]  older, but comedy shows, they don't allow any of that pushing and shoving bullshit. They'll kick
[07:09.950 --> 07:13.870]  you right out if you heckle. So you're sitting down the whole time and you can order food and
[07:13.870 --> 07:18.270]  they bring it to you. So comedy shows have been kind of my new go-to thing for a date or for some
[07:18.270 --> 07:21.870]  fun. It's really great to take a girl out and see a pretty girl smile at a comedy show. Shout out
[07:21.870 --> 07:24.670]  to my date. I don't think you listened to the show, but you know who you are at a great time
[07:24.670 --> 07:29.470]  with you. All right. That's enough local comedy. Do support local comedy. Shout out to the, uh,
[07:29.470 --> 07:33.550]  wild cousins comedy. Shout out to all the Pueblo comedy crew. Much love, much respect. All right.
[07:33.550 --> 07:37.550]  We've been talking about everything, but cannabis on this podcast for the past 10 minutes. Time for
[07:37.550 --> 07:42.270]  some weed. Let's talk about cannabis. Actually, let's not talk about weed. Let's fucking smoke
[07:42.270 --> 07:46.510]  some hash. You want to take a dab with me, bro? I would love a dab. Uh, Gorilla glue or girl scout
[07:46.510 --> 07:52.030]  cookies. Now let's, let's take a quick second here. Do you realize what I just asked you?
[07:52.030 --> 07:57.790]  I do. There are people in places that are probably just smacking their SMDH smack my
[07:57.790 --> 08:02.030]  damn head right now. I know it's shake my damn head, but I always, I thought of it as smack my
[08:02.030 --> 08:06.270]  damn head. Yeah. Smack myself in the footer. Yeah. That's what I thought of it when I first saw it.
[08:06.270 --> 08:10.030]  But, uh, there's somebody just went, this motherfucker has got girl scout cookies and
[08:10.030 --> 08:14.350]  Gorilla glue just sitting there ready to smoke. Yes, you guys. And it's not even flowers. It's
[08:14.350 --> 08:19.390]  the most beautiful hash you've ever seen. We're, we're kind of spoiled here. We are spoiled here.
[08:19.390 --> 08:23.950]  Anyway, Mike, yes. For legalization while we're on it. Yes. But when you do make sure that you
[08:23.950 --> 08:30.190]  include some sort of law or paragraph, there's a lot of caveats. If it allows you to have some
[08:30.190 --> 08:34.270]  sort of consumption place where everybody can gather and smoke cannabis. Cause that's what
[08:34.270 --> 08:38.030]  we missed here in Colorado. And right now we're struggling to get those types of rules in place.
[08:38.030 --> 08:42.270]  Would you like some wonderful news? I would like the yes, dude, enlighten me. But before you do,
[08:42.270 --> 08:44.910]  let's make a decision here. Would you like the girl scout cookies or would you like the
[08:45.710 --> 08:51.150]  gorilla glue? Only because right before we started recording, we did sample the girl scout. Yes,
[08:51.150 --> 08:56.510]  we did. All right. So it was quite wonderful. But I coughed for quite a bit. So I'm hoping
[08:56.510 --> 09:00.430]  the gorilla glue will be slightly less choky for me. I'm going to give you a little dab. Mike's
[09:00.430 --> 09:07.310]  kind of Mike. Why don't I no shame people take the dab you want. Not that everybody else is taking.
[09:07.310 --> 09:10.750]  That's the truth. You guys. Yeah. You don't have to dab like I do take a dab. That's comfortable
[09:10.750 --> 09:15.630]  for you. Uh, Mike just said that he had some news to share. I'm going to make Mike share his
[09:15.630 --> 09:20.110]  news before he takes this dab because like we just talked about, he's going to cough for 30 seconds
[09:20.110 --> 09:24.430]  and then this dab will be your reward for a quick cough. Just thinking about it. Yeah. This dab is
[09:24.430 --> 09:27.870]  your reward that is waiting for you. And I'm going to dab while you tell us about your news.
[09:27.870 --> 09:33.790]  So I got a text a few days ago from a local friend of mine in the industry down here.
[09:34.750 --> 09:39.470]  He's always been kind of a step removed. Um, he's like, he's not an owner of a dispenser or
[09:39.470 --> 09:45.070]  anything like that. But, uh, he got me a text saying he had a licensing hearing. You needed,
[09:45.070 --> 09:54.030]  he wanted me to attend and, uh, he received his, uh, special use permit to open a cannabis museum
[09:54.030 --> 10:00.190]  slash consumption location here in Pueblo County. Is this somebody that I know? Yep. Cool. Is it
[10:00.190 --> 10:03.310]  the person I think I know? Probably. Okay, cool. I think I know who you're talking about. We'll
[10:03.310 --> 10:07.470]  talk about specifics off the air. Shout out greener side, empire. Yeah, I totally know who
[10:07.470 --> 10:10.830]  you're talking about. Yeah. Shout out old school greener side, empire. What up? Hanky B hope you're
[10:10.830 --> 10:15.710]  doing well, homie. Yep. Uh, it's not, it's not Hanky. No, no. But when you say greener side,
[10:15.710 --> 10:20.110]  empire, that's, that's, that is the king of the greener side. Yeah. What up? Shorter dude with
[10:20.110 --> 10:30.270]  curly hair. So look for that coming. Um, so a cannabis museum, uh, during the licensing hearing
[10:30.350 --> 10:37.310]  his description of it would be a marijuana themed hard rock cafe would be the closest, um,
[10:38.110 --> 10:42.990]  business that he could relate it to that everyone's familiar with. So when you sit down at your,
[10:42.990 --> 10:48.190]  your booth with, uh, the marijuana product you bring yourself, there'll be stuff on the wall.
[10:48.190 --> 10:52.430]  That's like marijuana was originally outlawed and da da da da da da, like historical stuff.
[10:52.430 --> 10:56.190]  And they've hired local historians, like professional historians that do this for a
[10:56.190 --> 11:01.470]  living and are currently researching cannabis because there isn't a local historian who expert,
[11:03.550 --> 11:11.710]  word loss in my mind who focuses, who focuses, specializes in cannabis history. I suppose I
[11:11.710 --> 11:15.790]  could have qualified, but I didn't know that was a job I could have had. We could, um, they need
[11:15.790 --> 11:19.390]  to come to somebody, all of the schooling will be great and useful, but then they need to come to
[11:19.390 --> 11:23.390]  somebody involved in it, right. To get it. I'm sure they've got a couple of shit like us on the
[11:23.390 --> 11:28.350]  team. And if they don't, I'm going to be that person on the team for them. Uh, if at all possible,
[11:28.350 --> 11:34.030]  the dab rock cafe, if you will. Um, I I'm sure it's got a name, but I don't, I don't honestly
[11:34.030 --> 11:40.510]  remember it, but yeah, that should be coming here. Um, earliest estimates, first of the year, um,
[11:41.550 --> 11:46.990]  knowing how these things go sometimes I'm going to say by end of spring, we should have a place to go
[11:46.990 --> 11:52.990]  and, uh, enjoy some cannabis out in the public. You know what? Well, it was in a business that's
[11:53.390 --> 11:57.710]  good numbers only, but still that'd be in the city of Pueblo or in the County of just into the
[11:57.710 --> 12:01.630]  County, just into the County. All right, come on city of Pueblo. You guys want that damn tax money,
[12:01.630 --> 12:06.990]  but you won't let us have anything in the city. The, uh, Pueblo County passed rules and regs for
[12:06.990 --> 12:12.750]  public consumption shops. A while ago, there's only been one other applicant that I know of to
[12:12.750 --> 12:17.710]  try and, and they fucked it up so hard. It was painful to watch. I think I remember hearing
[12:17.710 --> 12:22.270]  about that. I was really pissed that they did it because that set everybody back. It's like six
[12:22.270 --> 12:27.070]  months. Ouch. All right, guys. So you heard it here first. Our buddy, Mike reported on it. Mike
[12:27.070 --> 12:32.110]  is our correspondent. Now suddenly reporter Mike live from the field. Mike, you went a dab, you
[12:32.110 --> 12:37.310]  went a free dab for such a wonderful report on the show here. Uh, there will be a show with prizes,
[12:37.310 --> 12:42.670]  marijuana. I like the word cannabis. There will be a cannabis museum in the County of Pueblo here
[12:42.670 --> 12:46.910]  before too long. That is really cool. Um, Mike said something about public consumption. I am
[12:46.910 --> 12:51.310]  going to humble myself. I'm going to eat a little bit of crow. If you will, on this show, never said
[12:51.310 --> 12:55.470]  eat crow before. Uh, I get the phrase and now that I've said it, I understand where it comes
[12:55.470 --> 12:58.270]  in perfectly. I've never said that I've heard it and thought that's a weird phrase, but it just
[12:58.270 --> 13:03.790]  came in perfectly. So shout out to the phrase, eat some crow. It's got its place. Um, why are you
[13:03.790 --> 13:10.590]  grubbing buddy? Well, recently I've had, I've had beef with a couple of people, uh, personal issues,
[13:11.230 --> 13:18.510]  uh, childish bullshit that's stuck in my mind. Uh, and they recently threw a harvest festival
[13:18.510 --> 13:23.630]  here in Pueblo, Colorado, and their event was completely fucking successful. Uh, they crushed
[13:23.630 --> 13:28.590]  it. They had a public consumption event three blocks from my house on the main street of our
[13:28.590 --> 13:34.030]  town. Our town is called Pueblo. This shit happened on Pueblo Boulevard. Uh, they smoked
[13:34.670 --> 13:40.030]  hash and weed and had a miniature cannabis cup basically in their parking lot four minutes from
[13:40.030 --> 13:43.630]  my house. I did not attend it because like I said, I was seeing Doug Benson and that was my priority.
[13:44.190 --> 13:50.110]  I was working, but a number of people, um, that I know were there, they said it went off huge.
[13:50.110 --> 13:54.990]  Uh, Spence and Jesse cleaned house. Spence won six awards and Jesse won first place. Jesse's
[13:54.990 --> 13:59.950]  outdoor grape OG beat. I don't know if I'm supposed to say that shit was outdoor, but Jesse's
[13:59.950 --> 14:06.110]  possibly outdoor grape OG greenhouse beat a greenhouse properly beat a bunch of indoor
[14:06.110 --> 14:10.270]  weeds. So shout out to Jesse for his victory. Shout out to Spence for six fucking awards,
[14:10.270 --> 14:15.230]  dude. Home runs boys. Nice. But you know what I've got? Uh, I've had personal issues with those
[14:15.230 --> 14:22.110]  people and it's my choice over possibly business issues, uh, that were legal involving a store.
[14:22.110 --> 14:25.950]  Uh, but, uh, even though we've got a little bit of beef, we don't get along. We don't see eye to eye
[14:25.950 --> 14:30.030]  on fucking everything. We're all in the same community. Uh, they pulled it off. I'm proud of
[14:30.030 --> 14:33.390]  them. I'm going to give them a shout out right here. Shout out to Terry. Shout out to fucking
[14:33.390 --> 14:37.710]  Ryan. You guys did it. You see that big old fucking plate of crow right here at the fucking
[14:37.710 --> 14:41.550]  grow from your heart podcast. I'm fucking feasting on it. You guys, I'm saying it out loud. They did
[14:41.550 --> 14:46.670]  it. I'm proud of them. Nice work. You guys, no sarcasm. Like I'm a smart ass and I'm fucking,
[14:46.670 --> 14:51.790]  I'm straight faced right here. Good work. You guys. I hear the turnout was way bigger than
[14:51.790 --> 14:55.390]  they were expecting and that they've had a previous events and I'm going to go to the
[14:55.390 --> 14:59.230]  next event that they throw. Like I've never gone to one of their events for personal,
[14:59.230 --> 15:03.790]  personal, stupid shit. Uh, and I'm a stubborn asshole, uh, something in me. If I don't like
[15:03.790 --> 15:07.070]  you for something you've done in the past, I'm probably not going to like you in the future,
[15:07.070 --> 15:10.990]  but I see them trying to make progress. I've tried to work with those people before and we
[15:10.990 --> 15:15.150]  just butt heads and so I've kind of separated myself, but I'm going to get over it and I'm
[15:15.150 --> 15:19.070]  going to go to their next event cause they crushed it this time. All right. So I had to man up there
[15:19.070 --> 15:23.550]  for a minute. I feel better. All right. Uh, Mike, you look perplexed. You've got a weird look on
[15:23.550 --> 15:30.430]  your face. No, I just, um, I wished I would've gone to that. Like I, when I heard how well it
[15:30.430 --> 15:33.630]  went, I was bummed that I had to work all weekend. Right? Yeah. I kind of wished that I would've
[15:33.630 --> 15:37.790]  gone, but that's fully the first time I felt about one of their events and they finally, uh,
[15:37.790 --> 15:42.110]  did it right from what I hear. I'm going to try. I haven't heard about any blowback from it either.
[15:42.110 --> 15:46.030]  Nothing happens. Really? Nothing went, nothing wrong went on. Yeah. It went smoothly without a,
[15:46.030 --> 15:51.630]  with, yeah, yeah. Well it's been several days. It's Wednesday now. Uh, it's about to be Thursday,
[15:51.630 --> 15:55.790]  so nothing's going to happen. I'm probably already would have Saturday. If it's not in the Saturday
[15:55.790 --> 16:01.950]  morning paper then Sunday paper. All right. Um, so I was going to say I was going to try not to
[16:01.950 --> 16:06.910]  miss any Doug Benson shows at comedy works. I'm gonna try to get as many as I can because, uh,
[16:06.910 --> 16:10.430]  if you tweet Doug Benson, he will read your tweets during the first 20 minutes of his show.
[16:10.430 --> 16:14.670]  That's what he does. He just reads tweets and makes fun of people. And so, uh, I just tweeted
[16:14.670 --> 16:19.630]  at him, Hey Doug front row again, feels like home. And so he read a bunch of tweets and he goes, uh,
[16:19.630 --> 16:23.630]  this guy back here says, where's whatever my tweeter name. And he's like, I'm over here.
[16:23.630 --> 16:28.510]  And he goes, his tweet says I'm way too high. Ha ha ha. And he goes, speaking of way too high
[16:28.510 --> 16:34.350]  Ross to Jeff's in the front row again, people fucking cheered, dude. They clapped and shit.
[16:34.350 --> 16:39.310]  And he goes, Ross to Jeff's been in the front row in that seat for the last 18 Doug Benson shows.
[16:39.310 --> 16:42.670]  He hasn't missed a show yet. That was so funny. I'm going to try not to miss any,
[16:42.670 --> 16:46.190]  dude. It's going to be a good time. If the listeners out there want this experience,
[16:46.190 --> 16:50.590]  the way to do it is amazing. We don't tell them every Doug Benson show. It's just the guy,
[16:50.590 --> 16:56.030]  the slot in Denver is taken. But if your ass lives in Cincinnati, like there's a way to do this,
[16:56.030 --> 17:01.470]  uh, go bananas. I think that's the club in Cincinnati. Maybe if that's see, like, I almost
[17:01.470 --> 17:05.310]  want to Google that shit. Let's I'm going to take fucking 30 seconds to Google. We might pause it.
[17:05.310 --> 17:10.430]  We might not. Let's see. We're going to have Siri do it. Yeah. I've been a Doug fan for a long time.
[17:10.430 --> 17:16.270]  I gotta start scheduling some of these off work. We'll see. I just asked Siri, where's the club go
[17:16.270 --> 17:23.870]  bananas live stand up since a fucking Natty, bro. I'm such a comedy geek go bananas. You've listened
[17:23.870 --> 17:28.190]  to a lot of podcasts. I do. I love comedy. Comedy is one of my favorite fucking things. I, all right.
[17:28.190 --> 17:31.950]  Cause we've been rambling on for like 20 minutes. Let's get onto a topic here. We've got a couple
[17:31.950 --> 17:37.150]  of things in the news that we could talk about. Um, I read an article. I'm not going to read you
[17:37.150 --> 17:42.750]  the article cause it's forever long. It's way too many words long, but I found this article
[17:42.750 --> 17:47.550]  on a website called the guardian. Mike also read it. So we'll, we'll be able to discuss it without
[17:47.550 --> 17:50.510]  reading it here on the show. And we'll be able to paraphrase a little bit for you guys and tell you
[17:50.510 --> 17:57.790]  what it's about. Essentially. Um, they're talking about an influx of people coming from across the
[17:57.790 --> 18:03.630]  country to Pueblo, Colorado, because Pueblo, Colorado for the size of the city that we are
[18:04.270 --> 18:10.590]  and for, uh, our economic development and the amount of cannabis jobs available, we are, uh,
[18:10.590 --> 18:15.710]  the most affordable place to land when you come from out of state. Would you agree with that? Mike?
[18:16.670 --> 18:23.470]  Um, we're routinely ranked as like the cheapest city in Colorado, um, for our size and for our
[18:23.470 --> 18:27.310]  size. Yeah. Right. If you went to anywhere smaller, you're pretty much fucked. Like the next smaller
[18:27.310 --> 18:33.470]  town, like you have to have a shitload of money to live in nowhere land. And this is, there's,
[18:33.470 --> 18:37.470]  there's a hundred thousand people here, which is just about perfect for coming to a city. That's
[18:37.470 --> 18:42.510]  not too expensive. Trying to get a new start. It's not too big. It's one of the cheapest cities in the
[18:42.990 --> 18:47.550]  U S recently. It's it's yeah. We're going to bring that up later. Denver can spit some people out.
[18:47.550 --> 18:51.710]  Denver can chew you up and spit you out. Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, uh, a lot
[18:51.710 --> 18:56.110]  of reasons people are moving to Pueblo right now. Um, legal marijuana is definitely one of them,
[18:56.110 --> 19:00.190]  but, uh, let's dive into the story. Cause I'm about to talk about a bunch of shit. We should
[19:00.190 --> 19:04.510]  want to get you fired up. I want to get you. It's like a pool in the fucking morning, the chains on
[19:04.670 --> 19:11.390]  I've been a part of this. I was a part of this story in like a backroom sense. I've met with
[19:11.390 --> 19:16.990]  all the players about this topic, but don't spill too many of those beans. I won't read, read away.
[19:16.990 --> 19:20.430]  We're not going to read it, but we'll talk about it. So they're saying that, uh, all of these
[19:20.430 --> 19:26.670]  people moving to Pueblo, Colorado, uh, are beginning to put a burden on our resources here.
[19:26.670 --> 19:30.990]  We have a resource called Posada, which is a nonprofit organization that helps families, uh,
[19:31.950 --> 19:36.110]  get their sub themselves on their feet. If something happens to somebody here in Pueblo,
[19:36.110 --> 19:40.030]  they can go to Posada. Uh, for example, there's a guy in this news article that hurt his foot,
[19:40.030 --> 19:43.390]  something fell on him and broke his foot and he can't work for a little bit. So he's going to
[19:43.390 --> 19:47.230]  Posada to get a little bit of help. Maybe, I don't know what they're giving him, possibly some food,
[19:47.230 --> 19:50.110]  probably some cheese, you know what I'm saying? Just to keep him on his feet while he's unable
[19:50.110 --> 19:56.510]  to work. But they're saying that those, uh, resources at Posada are being strained and
[19:56.510 --> 20:00.670]  the people are coming from all over the nation to come work here and they're not prepared.
[20:01.150 --> 20:03.470]  Mike, you look like you got something on your mind already. You're stewing, bro.
[20:03.470 --> 20:09.950]  No, it's, um, so what they're getting at is that, uh, legal marijuana is creating a huge
[20:09.950 --> 20:16.510]  homeless problem in Pueblo, Colorado. Right. Um, and it's not like causing good, hardworking
[20:16.510 --> 20:21.950]  Americans who got hooked on marijuana to become homeless. It's attracting homeless people in other
[20:21.950 --> 20:30.190]  areas to Pueblo apparently. Um, and the article goes on to cite people that work, um, at Posada
[20:30.990 --> 20:38.590]  and a couple other agencies in town, um, saying that they've had huge increases in people seeking
[20:38.590 --> 20:46.270]  services from them, whether it's a housing vouchers or, um, food stamps or food bank,
[20:47.310 --> 20:55.790]  medicine vouchers, or help with medical problems. Um, Posada especially has been pretty vocal
[20:56.510 --> 21:02.110]  with the press down here in Pueblo. And then it's spiraled nationally. Uh, when the anti-pot groups
[21:02.110 --> 21:06.830]  picked it up and started pushing it, other newspapers started picking it up. Um, the,
[21:06.830 --> 21:13.390]  one of the problems caused by amendment 64 is more homeless people, um, coming to Colorado
[21:13.390 --> 21:21.150]  because of our marijuana laws. And just that idea never really made sense to me until I realized
[21:21.150 --> 21:26.110]  that it's not illegal to be homeless most places, but it is illegal to have pop most places. Right.
[21:26.830 --> 21:34.030]  And homeless people have huge rates of substance abuse. And if, um, if you're homeless,
[21:34.030 --> 21:38.350]  consuming substances is a way to deal with some of the miserable conditions in that
[21:38.350 --> 21:44.110]  lifestyle. Absolutely. Um, so if you can move to a place where they're not going to chase you
[21:44.110 --> 21:50.750]  around and throw you in jail for having some weed, why not be there? And when that's combined with
[21:51.310 --> 21:55.950]  number of other things that are happening at the same time, like legal marijuana here, everybody's
[21:56.750 --> 22:01.230]  talking about how many thousands of people are working in the industry and how much money it's
[22:01.230 --> 22:06.830]  making. No, one's talking about what it takes to get an MED badge. So that's something I was going
[22:06.830 --> 22:12.830]  to touch on in a few minutes when you're homeless and there's a new booming industry. I mean, it's
[22:12.830 --> 22:17.070]  humans have been doing it since humans started doing anything. We move forward to where there's
[22:17.070 --> 22:23.230]  work. Um, especially when there's no work and we're just coming out of a depression, like a
[22:23.230 --> 22:28.910]  national depression where works hard to come by everywhere, especially in our age demographic.
[22:29.950 --> 22:36.430]  Remember all those articles about people in their thirties that moved home after college, right? Oh,
[22:36.430 --> 22:41.310]  fuck load of them. We all got degrees. How to not, I'm not saying me, but a lot of them got
[22:41.310 --> 22:45.630]  degrees on like internet stuff. And now those jobs are all taken up. That shit kind of failed,
[22:45.790 --> 22:49.310]  not fail, but I mean, it's just gotten so much easier to make a webpage that that guy that used
[22:49.310 --> 22:53.230]  to know how to do it. Isn't. And I have, I have a theory that that's going to happen to the weed
[22:53.230 --> 22:57.710]  grower too. I'm going to do a whole report on that here on the podcast in the future. So yeah, those,
[22:57.710 --> 23:04.990]  those people are now in the weed industry, making a pretty solid living. Yeah. Um, so there's a lot
[23:04.990 --> 23:10.510]  of reasons homeless people are, or people on the brink of being homeless or moving to Colorado.
[23:11.230 --> 23:16.510]  And I mean, I've said it countless times, like, if you want to come here, that's great,
[23:16.510 --> 23:21.630]  but come prepared. Right? That's like, look what I wrote. Come prepared is one of the, seriously,
[23:21.630 --> 23:25.390]  that's written on this fucking paper. Come prepared. Um, that's huge. And a lot of people
[23:25.390 --> 23:32.750]  didn't like when you're kind of at the end of your road financially in opportunity wise, wherever you
[23:32.750 --> 23:38.830]  live and you hear about Colorado and everything that's going on here, all the stores, all the
[23:38.830 --> 23:45.230]  grows. I mean, you figure at least I can get a job trimming. Right. Um, I can sit in a room and
[23:45.230 --> 23:50.910]  cut leaf soft buds all day. I can surely do it in scrubs. Like I'll move there and do it, but no one
[23:50.910 --> 23:56.510]  knows what that takes. Right. You guys, if you're going to cut and, uh, come prepared, that's
[23:56.510 --> 24:00.110]  definitely the thing. Come here with a little bit of money. Cause it's going to take a minute to get
[24:00.110 --> 24:06.270]  a job in the weed industry. You have to get before you even come here, research a Colorado marijuana
[24:06.270 --> 24:11.230]  enforcement division support badge. Yeah. If you're coming here for work in the industry,
[24:11.230 --> 24:14.750]  definitely know what it takes to get a job in the industry. And you're not going to get a job
[24:14.750 --> 24:19.070]  trimming for your, you may get a job trimming for your cousin or whatever, but that shit's not going
[24:19.070 --> 24:23.790]  to last long. That's not going to, that's not going to sustain you. It may sound fruitful right
[24:23.790 --> 24:29.070]  now, but trimming for your buddy or trimming for whoever's got this girl option, uh, for you,
[24:29.630 --> 24:34.030]  it's not going to work unless it's a legal, unless they own a business. There's a lot of,
[24:34.030 --> 24:38.750]  a lot of people that have lived here or have recently moved here with kind of a plan and gotten
[24:38.750 --> 24:44.350]  a job that are growing their legal six plants and they need help trimming and they'll call you and
[24:44.350 --> 24:50.190]  you can trim for them for like 10 hours once every 90 days. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And it's unreliable.
[24:50.190 --> 24:54.430]  You need to, you need to work for like five of those people if you want to try to pay rent that
[24:54.430 --> 24:59.150]  way. Right. And you're not going to find four others right when you move here. I hate it that
[24:59.150 --> 25:03.390]  the term is I use go trim for other people, but I mean, it's expected, but I hate that shit. Yep.
[25:03.390 --> 25:07.950]  I hate it. That's like them seeing under my skirt or something, but, and then go tell everybody else
[25:07.950 --> 25:12.030]  what was under there. But yeah, if you're not trimming, if you don't need a med badge, that's
[25:12.030 --> 25:16.110]  probably not a job that's going to last for very long right now. They're cleaning up illegal grow
[25:16.110 --> 25:20.270]  operations. They're getting rid of all of that shit here in Colorado. It's going away. So when
[25:20.270 --> 25:24.830]  things are legal, the illegal stands out like a sore thumb. True. Very true. That's something we've
[25:24.830 --> 25:29.310]  talked about on the show. So research, getting your marijuana enforcement division support badge.
[25:29.310 --> 25:33.470]  If you've got any drug felonies in the last 10 years, don't even think about coming to Colorado
[25:33.470 --> 25:36.670]  to get a job in the industry. They're not going to give you a badge. If you don't have the badge,
[25:36.670 --> 25:40.350]  you can't walk in the door. We can't let you behind the counter. You can't go in the gross
[25:40.350 --> 25:46.110]  space. You can't trim, you can't deliver. You can't sweep the parking lot. Like I swear to God,
[25:47.950 --> 25:54.670]  get on the website. It takes two seconds, Google Colorado, MED badge. And it'll come right up.
[25:54.670 --> 26:00.030]  Our security guards are badged with their security service, like trained with their
[26:00.030 --> 26:04.590]  security. They wear their security guard badge and their shirts for their security and their gun
[26:04.590 --> 26:08.670]  all day long. But they are also wearing a marijuana enforcement division badge. They
[26:08.670 --> 26:14.030]  have to have that shit to work there. So they had to go spend an extra, it's like 150 bucks for that
[26:14.030 --> 26:19.390]  badge just to work there. So you guys, if you can't afford $150 badge, and if you can't qualify
[26:19.390 --> 26:23.790]  for that badge, don't come here, please. Because I'm not talking shit to you. I'm not saying don't
[26:23.790 --> 26:26.670]  come here. You're just going to be stuck. You're not going to be able to get in the industry.
[26:26.670 --> 26:29.630]  You're going to be relying on resources here and you're going to make it, it just kind of makes
[26:29.630 --> 26:33.630]  it look shitty. And if you can come here and do something, you're invited. Come on. If you're
[26:33.630 --> 26:37.630]  able, if you're willing, if you're ready, if you can trim, if you're able to get the badge,
[26:37.630 --> 26:40.990]  we'll take you. But honestly, I'm going to sound like an asshole here.
[26:40.990 --> 26:47.390]  So while we're on it, the big four requirements are no drug felonies in 10 years, no felonies,
[26:47.390 --> 26:51.870]  period, in five. It's kind of fucked up that you could have like killed someone and like with your
[26:51.870 --> 26:53.630]  car or something. Five years ago.
[26:53.950 --> 26:58.590]  Five years ago and get your badge before the guy who got busted with an out or what is it?
[26:58.590 --> 27:00.990]  Two grams of concentrate in most places. Yeah.
[27:03.550 --> 27:04.190]  Fucked up world.
[27:04.990 --> 27:10.510]  Yeah, it really is. But so no drug felonies in 10 years, no felonies in five and your student loans
[27:10.510 --> 27:15.630]  and your child support need to be in order. Now what in order means is you, it means you have to
[27:15.630 --> 27:19.550]  call them and set up a payment plan and make one payment. If you're already paying on it,
[27:19.550 --> 27:23.310]  you're legit. They won't even say you're already paying, paying on it and everything's in good,
[27:23.310 --> 27:27.070]  good order. You're fine. But if you've been ducking child support for,
[27:27.070 --> 27:31.870]  or student loans for a while, you got to stand up, call Sally May and start making payments.
[27:31.870 --> 27:34.830]  Yep. And all they want is a receipt and proof that you're paying.
[27:34.830 --> 27:39.310]  I had to do it. Like I had to go show them that my student loans were in good order. All I had
[27:39.310 --> 27:41.790]  to do is get a thing from both loan companies. It was really easy.
[27:41.790 --> 27:45.790]  I filled out, I printed the application online. I printed it at home. I filled it out. It took
[27:45.790 --> 27:50.270]  me like 30 minutes to do it, whatever, you know, it's just like a thick job application, but really
[27:50.270 --> 27:55.950]  thorough. Yeah. And then they give it to the FBI who checks it. So you can't just lie.
[27:55.950 --> 28:00.110]  And while they're checking, they're smart as fuck. They take your paperwork and start running it.
[28:00.110 --> 28:04.590]  Then they call you back while it's being ran and they fingerprint you and they take their sweet
[28:04.590 --> 28:08.830]  fucking time fingerprinting you so that if there is anything wrong with your paperwork, if they,
[28:08.830 --> 28:12.270]  if you're illegal, if you've got warrants, they'll come and get your ass right there.
[28:12.270 --> 28:16.990]  I, yeah. I wondered why it took so long. It seemed like the tech was brand new and
[28:16.990 --> 28:21.710]  yet it took her 74 tries to get my index finger. Oh yeah. That fingerprinting thing,
[28:21.710 --> 28:26.270]  that laser reading fingerprinter is hard. It feels like it doesn't like me after like six
[28:26.270 --> 28:29.710]  tries. Right. Yeah. I've, they've actually come and arrested people who've had warrants
[28:30.430 --> 28:34.110]  while they were there. Yeah. They don't fuck around. So one thing I was going to say,
[28:34.110 --> 28:38.430]  and this is going to sound like really rude as fuck. Oh, and take cash. When you go to the
[28:38.430 --> 28:42.350]  license place. Oh yeah. They do not take a check or a money order. You got to go. If you go to the
[28:43.150 --> 28:47.470]  cash, it's one 50. I don't even want to quote the prices right now because they change all the
[28:47.470 --> 28:52.510]  fucking time. Yup. I paid one 50 for mine. Was that a big echo? I didn't hear it. Okay. I've
[28:52.510 --> 28:56.110]  got these headphones on. I just thought I heard echo as long as we're not echoing in the recording.
[28:56.110 --> 29:01.870]  Oh, you guys, I know it sounds great to pack up your whole life and come to Colorado and
[29:01.870 --> 29:06.350]  enjoy the dispensary and smoke some legal cannabis. And it is, it's amazing. I have a plan,
[29:06.350 --> 29:12.030]  have a plan. It's not as complicated as it sounds. I'm going to use Adam as an example. Unless you're
[29:12.270 --> 29:15.550]  a deep sea fisherman, we've got your fucking job here too. Adam thought he was going to come here
[29:15.550 --> 29:19.950]  and grow some pot and be the King shit of the fucking world. And I'm not talking to shit about
[29:19.950 --> 29:25.790]  Adam. Adam is making it, but Adam is not buying whatever CD came out last week. He's Adam is not
[29:25.790 --> 29:30.910]  going with us to dinner. I work construction with an all winter. Yeah, exactly. See? Yeah. And I'm
[29:30.910 --> 29:33.870]  not trying to add them. I love you, bro. I'm not talking to shit. I'm just showed up, realized that
[29:33.870 --> 29:37.390]  that wasn't going to be how it was going to play out and immediately got to work. Yeah. He thought
[29:37.470 --> 29:43.150]  he was going to come here and grow and survive. And it was, you can make it. Yeah. If you fight
[29:43.150 --> 29:49.870]  for it, you can make it, but come here with a plan, save up some money, find a job, find a place
[29:49.870 --> 29:56.590]  or two that you want to see to rent. Like have a plan. Yes. Or don't just show up here with a U-Haul
[29:56.590 --> 30:02.590]  truck and $300 in your pocket. Cause you will be homeless in like four days or my, my option for
[30:02.590 --> 30:07.550]  you, which I recommend, which you're going to think I'm a dick, but, uh, save the energy that
[30:07.550 --> 30:12.030]  you were going to use to move here and use that energy to fight for legalization where you are.
[30:12.030 --> 30:16.430]  Just push that over. Yeah. Just do that right where you are. Just gather a bunch of people,
[30:16.430 --> 30:20.670]  uh, get a bunch of like-minded folk. It'd be cool if you can get all the smokers around,
[30:20.670 --> 30:24.430]  but I understand a bunch of potheads. Sometimes you don't want the potheads to go to city council
[30:24.430 --> 30:27.710]  with you. There's a couple of guys you just want to leave them behind. We've definitely had more
[30:27.710 --> 30:31.070]  than one walk up and shoot themselves and everybody else in the foot. And it sucked.
[30:31.070 --> 30:34.590]  Yeah. That some, some of those guys you can just leave them behind, but try to get a,
[30:34.590 --> 30:38.430]  uh, an intelligent group of people, put an ad on Craigslist in your area. Say,
[30:38.430 --> 30:42.190]  Hey, I want to fight to legalize cannabis. Let's start a legalization group. And you guys get
[30:42.190 --> 30:48.990]  together and you, uh, make a, uh, a petition and you make a petition and you try to get it put on
[30:48.990 --> 30:54.750]  the ballot for your community that, Hey, we want to make a medical marijuana legalization movement.
[30:54.750 --> 30:59.150]  It's even easier than that. There's already three groups. If you're listening to this in the U S
[30:59.150 --> 31:04.350]  there's already three groups in your state, town and city working on it. You just have to find them
[31:04.350 --> 31:10.270]  normal, find normal, the national organizations for the reform of marijuana laws, the project
[31:10.270 --> 31:14.750]  policy, the marijuana policy project. Yes. See, I think I know how I'm reaching for it. I just
[31:14.750 --> 31:19.550]  fucking, I have that ADD and then who's our third friend. You said there's three of them.
[31:21.150 --> 31:27.550]  No, I wasn't thinking of three specific. There's three responsible Ohio and
[31:29.150 --> 31:33.310]  there's fucking one in Maine, Google cannibal, cannibal, cannibal. No, don't Google.
[31:33.870 --> 31:39.310]  The dozen States are voting on marijuana legalization next year. Cannabis advocacy
[31:39.310 --> 31:44.270]  groups for your areas, which you want to find and then join that shit and then do what you can.
[31:44.270 --> 31:47.630]  Uh, everybody's got their own gift in life. And if you want to fight for legalization,
[31:47.630 --> 31:52.270]  you have to find where you fit in, find what you can do. My niche is this podcast. My niche is
[31:52.270 --> 31:55.710]  making seeds. My niche is growing like a motherfucker. My niche is taking care of
[31:55.710 --> 31:59.950]  my patients and paying attention to what works for them medicinally and adjusting my gross
[31:59.950 --> 32:05.470]  schedule and my grow nutrients and my gross strains to work for my individual patients,
[32:05.470 --> 32:09.710]  medical needs, which is an art to tell you the fucking truth to grow enough weed for Mike and
[32:09.710 --> 32:14.270]  enough weed for Doug and the other people that I supply and have the right strains at the right
[32:14.270 --> 32:18.670]  times for these people. It takes a little bit of scheduling and a little bit of foresight. So,
[32:19.230 --> 32:24.350]  uh, whatever you do, if you're a construction worker and you're looking to move here and do
[32:24.350 --> 32:28.910]  construction and smoke weed in the evenings, have as much of a fucking plan about what you're going
[32:28.910 --> 32:34.030]  to do in life is Jeff just laid out right there is like what he does is his niche. Like at least
[32:34.030 --> 32:41.310]  that much you should be getting online and like, Oh, I, you know, I'm a car salesman, find a dozen
[32:41.310 --> 32:46.670]  car dealerships looking for employees before you even consider moving out here. Yeah. Call them,
[32:46.670 --> 32:51.150]  contact them, send them your information, let them know you'll be here whenever looking for a job
[32:51.950 --> 32:56.270]  long before you move out here. The people that moved out here with just the hope and a prayer,
[32:56.990 --> 33:01.230]  most of them have had to beg people for money so that they can haul their ass back home.
[33:02.030 --> 33:08.990]  Um, and that has to suck. Unfortunately, Colorado has become the, not what you know,
[33:08.990 --> 33:13.230]  but who, you know, state, uh, if you want to be in the cannabis industry right now,
[33:13.230 --> 33:18.670]  there's just so many rules and regulations in the tiniest fuck up can cost the shop 10,000,
[33:18.990 --> 33:23.950]  a hundred thousand bucks that you can lose their licensing. Um, because you did something that
[33:23.950 --> 33:30.030]  half the people that walk in our doors every day, assume we're doing constantly. Um, so
[33:32.110 --> 33:39.150]  gaining that level of trust in a job interviews, a motherfucker. Absolutely. Um, and if your main
[33:39.150 --> 33:45.070]  sales pitch is that you've been high as shit for a decade, like just don't try, like come here and
[33:45.070 --> 33:49.230]  do whatever you've been doing to make a living. If it's selling weed, don't move here. Cause we
[33:49.230 --> 33:54.590]  got stores that do that now. Um, I get to look at a lot of job applications because, uh, anything
[33:54.590 --> 33:58.670]  that goes for the grow department, the job applications get passed to myself and another guy.
[34:00.030 --> 34:08.190]  You would not believe some of the verbiage that I see in job applications, like list your skills,
[34:08.190 --> 34:13.790]  dog. I could grow the sticky, icky fire dog. I got hydro skills with the Z and shit. And we,
[34:13.790 --> 34:19.310]  we honestly, we throw those applications away, uh, bring a resume, look professional. It is the
[34:19.310 --> 34:24.350]  weed industry, but it is called industry. It's business. We're trying to better our business.
[34:24.350 --> 34:28.030]  We need to make money so we can improve our business. We can open more stores. It's just
[34:28.030 --> 34:32.110]  how business fucking works. Don't come trying to talk like you're a cool gangster and try to
[34:32.110 --> 34:37.470]  impress us. Be professional. Yeah. Legal comes with rules, regulations, and expectations. You're
[34:37.470 --> 34:40.910]  going to be wearing a lab coat. If you work next to me in the grow, I know that sounds ridiculous.
[34:40.910 --> 34:44.830]  We were to lab coats, bro. We've got a different lab coat for each room. I need to know that you're
[34:44.830 --> 34:48.910]  responsible enough to wear this lab coat in room a and know that you need to take that son of a
[34:48.910 --> 34:54.030]  bitch off and put on another lab coat before you enter room B or you need to be aware enough to
[34:54.030 --> 34:57.710]  actually care about cross-contamination. Yeah. Yeah. We need to know that you can read the
[34:57.710 --> 35:02.750]  warning signs when we use a pesticide and we put up a certain do not enter sign or whatever gear
[35:02.750 --> 35:06.830]  is required to enter this room. We do know that you can read that kind of stuff. Even the sales
[35:06.830 --> 35:13.710]  people. If I make a real simple mistake, I can get the shop shut down. Yeah. Oh yeah. Um, anybody,
[35:13.710 --> 35:17.950]  anybody that works there pretty much with the badge. If we do the right, if we say the wrong
[35:17.950 --> 35:23.630]  shit, the store can be closed at any minute. Yeah. And we're under camera. You guys, you guys think
[35:23.630 --> 35:28.190]  we can hang out and smoke pot and be chill? No, it's busy as fuck all the time. There's no chairs
[35:28.190 --> 35:33.870]  where I work. There are no chairs in my work area. I'm always standing up. Uh, but also we're under
[35:33.950 --> 35:39.390]  camera from every angle at all times. You're on two cameras, no matter where you are in that
[35:39.390 --> 35:43.390]  building. There are two cameras covering that area. I cannot scratch my ass in that building
[35:43.390 --> 35:48.190]  without being seen. If you do something really funny, you can go to the office and ask for the
[35:48.190 --> 35:54.430]  footage like immediately. Cause it's available. I've had security that was three rooms away.
[35:54.430 --> 36:00.430]  Make fun of me for butt crack. Yeah. And the camera, everything is on camera to the point
[36:00.430 --> 36:08.110]  where they can read. I driver's licenses. They read the number on my car outside in the parking
[36:08.110 --> 36:11.630]  lot with the camera. Yeah. That's how fucking smooth those cameras were. They were reading
[36:11.630 --> 36:16.990]  VIN numbers on cars. Like people really don't understand the level of regulation and scrutiny
[36:16.990 --> 36:21.310]  that the industry is under those cameras go about a hundred feet all the way around the perimeter of
[36:21.310 --> 36:24.350]  the building all the way, like a hundred feet. Seriously. I'm not even kidding. They go all the
[36:24.350 --> 36:27.870]  way to the street and shit. That's why when you hear about a dispenser, you're getting robbed in
[36:27.870 --> 36:31.630]  Colorado. You hear about the arrest of the guy who did it like an hour and a half later. Right?
[36:31.630 --> 36:37.470]  Yeah. Boy. And it's funny. Cause if somebody smokes anywhere near the building, our security
[36:37.470 --> 36:41.310]  guards damn near run outside with their gun in their hand. You cannot smoke on our premises.
[36:41.310 --> 36:46.670]  You guys, nobody is a holster, but yeah, you can't, he really wants to take it. I'm exaggerating.
[36:46.670 --> 36:53.630]  I'm exaggerating. Yes. But if you cannot smoke anything anywhere near our dispensary, you guys,
[36:53.630 --> 36:58.190]  we can't have, I've mentioned this before, excuse my burping. We cannot have, I'm a medical
[36:58.190 --> 37:03.790]  marijuana patient and I cannot have my, any of my medical marijuana products in my private vehicle
[37:03.790 --> 37:09.390]  on my work shift in my car, parked in the parking lot at the dispensary. I have to wait until I get
[37:09.390 --> 37:14.110]  home. I have to drive home and dab hard after work because I can't have the shit there.
[37:14.110 --> 37:18.430]  Anything that might be seen as on-site consumption could cost the shop its license.
[37:18.510 --> 37:25.870]  Right. We can't carry our beverages. Uh, I can't as a, as a guy that works in the back,
[37:25.870 --> 37:30.670]  I can take my bottle, my, my Dr. Pepper after lunch, I can take that back to the back of the
[37:30.670 --> 37:35.710]  building, but they will not let me take my drink into the bud room when I go visit Mike, when I'm
[37:35.710 --> 37:40.990]  chatting him up, when I'm taking a pee break. Like if Mike's, uh, Mike and I hardly ever see
[37:40.990 --> 37:45.070]  each other at work, but when we do, it's like, Hey buddy, no open containers in the bedroom.
[37:45.150 --> 37:48.990]  If you say you were a customer and you spilled that shit in a jar of weed,
[37:48.990 --> 37:54.190]  I couldn't even charge you for what you just ruined. Um, because I can legally only sell you
[37:54.190 --> 37:59.390]  an ounce or an ounce or an ounce depending on where your license says you're from. That's shitty. Um,
[37:59.390 --> 38:05.310]  and so if you're from Texas and you spill your, your water into a jar of weed, this guy, eight
[38:05.310 --> 38:12.990]  ounces of weed in it, um, this shop's gotta eat a lot of money. That's my job. Ouch. So can you
[38:12.990 --> 38:17.470]  take your water bottle back there or anything? Only if it's got a lid. Okay. Just a water bottle
[38:17.470 --> 38:21.470]  with a lid. And then like, keep it well the fuck away from the bud counter. That's why I was asking.
[38:21.470 --> 38:24.430]  I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple of water bottles back by that window. Well, it's like
[38:25.070 --> 38:28.990]  the window ledge is where they go. That's where they're safe. Yeah. The window ledge. All right,
[38:28.990 --> 38:32.190]  cool. So yeah, that it's strict. You guys, what I'm getting at is there is no hanging out,
[38:32.190 --> 38:37.150]  smoking pot, being lazy, having fun. Uh, the only time I get to groove and have a good time is when
[38:37.150 --> 38:41.710]  I'm pushing a broom or a mop. Like I will catch myself shaking my ass because I got me, we play,
[38:41.710 --> 38:46.190]  we play loud music in the back and there's good music up front most of the time. Uh, so there's
[38:46.190 --> 38:50.030]  good music going on as one of the best parts. But, uh, the only time you get to chill out and have
[38:50.030 --> 38:54.750]  fun is on lunch breaks or sometimes we have a little team meetings and shit, which are fun,
[38:54.750 --> 38:58.510]  but it's hard work working in a dispensary. You guys, if you're coming here to work in the
[38:58.510 --> 39:02.990]  industry, be ready to put in work, put in work. Yeah. Don't, uh, you guys, I'm serious. If like
[39:02.990 --> 39:09.310]  all day, every day, it never stops. Yeah. Uh, should I go in and nine ish just depends on the
[39:09.310 --> 39:12.910]  day. Some more between eight and 10 just depends on honestly how busy we're going to be. What I've
[39:12.910 --> 39:15.710]  got to do. I know what I've got to do today. I know how much time it's going to take, but sometimes
[39:15.710 --> 39:19.310]  we won't leave there. We've left at seven o'clock before we've gone in at nine in the morning and
[39:19.310 --> 39:23.710]  not, we've gone at eight and left at seven. Oh, I've worked several 12 hour days there before.
[39:23.710 --> 39:28.270]  Yeah. You're you guys up front have to work longer shifts because you can't close up there until the
[39:28.270 --> 39:31.630]  time in the back. We can pretty much where, but we just got to finish the job. There's a lot of
[39:31.630 --> 39:36.430]  shit to do in the back. Sometimes it's just what happens in the legal industry. Like there's work
[39:36.430 --> 39:43.710]  to be done and it's got to get done by somebody. And pot takes a lot of work. A lot of planning.
[39:43.710 --> 39:49.790]  Yep. A lot of planning for us in the back. People come here with just the craziest expectations and
[39:49.790 --> 39:53.230]  it's fucked a lot of people. If you're one of those guys that quits a job all the time. If
[39:53.230 --> 39:56.270]  you're one of those guys that can't show up on time, if you're one of the guys that makes excuses,
[39:56.270 --> 40:02.990]  you're not going to make it in the marijuana industry. Come dinner time. Like, no. Yeah.
[40:03.070 --> 40:05.310]  Yeah. You got to look professional. You got to take care of yourself here.
[40:06.110 --> 40:11.630]  Uh, you guys, this may sound like shit, but this is the truth. Uh, for every one dude that is
[40:11.630 --> 40:16.430]  hireable, there are seven women that are hireable that are way more attractive than you. So if
[40:16.430 --> 40:20.510]  you're a dude and you're trying to get a job in the industry, uh, you got to get your shit together
[40:20.510 --> 40:26.350]  because you put a real resume together. Beautiful women sell more weed. So there's already a,
[40:26.350 --> 40:32.750]  an uphill battle for a lot of you dudes clean up. Yeah. Always resume. Resume.
[40:32.750 --> 40:38.670]  All right. Do your shit. Um, let's see. We've been going for 40 minutes. Holy crap. Um,
[40:38.670 --> 40:43.950]  we're so big. This is like the longest news article. Summation. We didn't even read the
[40:43.950 --> 40:48.430]  news articles. So many different places with this. I like this podcast. It felt right. Um,
[40:50.750 --> 40:56.510]  so just to get slightly back on topic, let's do it. The thing that pisses me off the most about
[40:56.510 --> 41:03.230]  this whole legal pot causes an increase in homelessness nonsense is like one of the big
[41:03.230 --> 41:08.510]  reasons Pueblo is experiencing a lot more homeless people right now looking for services or people on
[41:08.510 --> 41:13.950]  the brink of being homeless, looking for services is because all of the cities around us currently
[41:13.950 --> 41:18.510]  bus homeless people out of their area. That's the only way they've got to deal with it. If a
[41:18.510 --> 41:24.270]  Posada could have anything they wanted right now, it would be millions more funding so that they
[41:24.270 --> 41:30.030]  could send everybody back home. Um, and there's a small reason for that. Like if you send everybody
[41:30.030 --> 41:34.830]  home, hopefully they've got family, friends, people in the community that they know and can
[41:34.830 --> 41:39.150]  make contact with to help them get back on their feet, like somewhere where they're tied to the
[41:39.150 --> 41:44.350]  community a little bit rather than here where they're strangers to everybody. Right. Um, but
[41:45.070 --> 41:50.670]  most places are just like, Hey, guess what? I hear this place up the way that you probably can't get
[41:50.670 --> 41:56.910]  back to without a lot of help is banging. You should go there. Here's a bus ticket there for
[41:56.910 --> 42:04.510]  free, bro. They've got like everything you need. Um, I had a guy asked me for a ride that one day
[42:04.510 --> 42:08.510]  and I probably would have told him no, except the place he was asking to go was like a block and a
[42:08.510 --> 42:14.990]  half from where I was headed. And I took a look at him and he looked totally fucked. But like
[42:14.990 --> 42:20.430]  recently, like his clothes were clean, but he looked like he had the worst day after the worst
[42:20.430 --> 42:24.750]  month ever. And I was like, all right, dude, I can give you a ride to where I'm already going.
[42:24.750 --> 42:29.710]  I've like got like 150 pounds on you. Even if you pull like a real fucking loaded weapon on me,
[42:29.710 --> 42:37.070]  I've got this, especially in a car. Like if I can reach you, it's I win. And his little story just
[42:38.030 --> 42:45.230]  like, he had a serious medical condition. Um, he was in Albuquerque and they were like, dude,
[42:45.230 --> 42:51.950]  didn't you hear Pueblo's got it for you. They've got like free services for you with your shit
[42:51.950 --> 42:56.030]  and they'll take real good care of you. And the community is going to love you and they'll get
[42:56.030 --> 43:01.870]  you a house and a job and fucking get you on your feet. And this is Pueblo they're talking about.
[43:01.870 --> 43:09.070]  We don't got fuck off for anybody. Yeah. Um, unless you're looking to invest a couple of
[43:09.070 --> 43:13.790]  million dollars in a new marijuana farm, like Pueblo don't got what you're looking for.
[43:15.950 --> 43:20.110]  It's cheap to live. And I bet nobody told him that the highest unemployment in Colorado too.
[43:20.750 --> 43:25.470]  Yeah. We've got the Colorado unemployment rates, like four points something. It's one of the lower
[43:25.870 --> 43:32.430]  lowest in the nation, but Pueblo's unemployment rate is like five and a half or six, like a good
[43:32.430 --> 43:36.750]  point and a half higher than the rest of the state. And when you magnify that times, the
[43:36.750 --> 43:43.310]  amount of people that are in the state, like it's a huge, huge chunk of the jobs. Like there's a lot
[43:43.310 --> 43:48.030]  of people that came here looking for work that are just fucking shit out of luck now because they
[43:48.030 --> 43:53.870]  came with no plan, but we're trying to pin it on legal pot when there's like 30 different reasons,
[43:54.670 --> 43:57.630]  homeless people and people about to be homeless or headed to Pueblo.
[43:59.070 --> 44:03.310]  You can't rank us the cheapest, like the third cheapest city in the U S and expect that shit,
[44:03.310 --> 44:07.390]  not to have consequences, which is in every newspaper in the country. You know what I did
[44:07.390 --> 44:12.430]  not plan poorly. Huh? This dab. Nope. Get it. Let's do this. You guys, I'm going to hit the dab.
[44:12.430 --> 44:18.030]  I'm hitting the fucking hit man. The Samson hit man combo collab rig with a highly educated
[44:18.350 --> 44:25.310]  on it that runs to the, uh, G nail from emo tech. Shout out to giddy up Dougie. Shout out to task.
[44:25.310 --> 44:32.110]  Let's do this. Keep going, Mike. Keep going while I dab more about Posada. Oh, Posada is,
[44:32.110 --> 44:36.510]  I don't have anything against Posada, except they're being nuts on this issue. They're getting
[44:36.510 --> 44:41.870]  national press talking about how it's all marijuana's fault. And then if you read the
[44:41.870 --> 44:45.950]  article, you'll get about three quarters of the way through when they mentioned like other cities,
[44:45.950 --> 44:49.950]  bus and homeless people here and straight line to them when they're putting them on the bus,
[44:49.950 --> 44:54.830]  telling them Pueblo is great. And a Pueblo being ranked the cheapest city in the U S
[44:56.750 --> 45:00.910]  tons of people moving here. Sure. That three or four of them are going to get
[45:00.910 --> 45:04.270]  jobs in the marijuana industry only to find out that we don't take felons.
[45:07.790 --> 45:13.550]  I mean, multiple, multiple, they just don't publicize any of the requirements anywhere
[45:13.550 --> 45:18.510]  outside of this podcast basically. Right? Yeah. So that's your public service announcement. You
[45:18.510 --> 45:22.110]  guys make sure you Google that shit. Make sure you can find out if you're even qualified to work
[45:22.110 --> 45:26.910]  in our industry. And if you're going, if you're coming here to run an illegal industry, I'm not
[45:26.910 --> 45:33.070]  even trying to be a smart ass. Uh, I was deep shit into the illegal cannabis industry. I can
[45:33.070 --> 45:37.710]  admit it now. I can talk about that. You know what? I had to get away from it because it wasn't going
[45:37.710 --> 45:42.350]  to work much longer. I was going to go downhill trying to stay on that side of the world. Now
[45:42.350 --> 45:47.550]  I've got a steady job. Everything is legit. Uh, it's much easier. You guys, it's much easier. And
[45:47.550 --> 45:52.030]  the illegal industry is going away. You can see it crumbling here. Those people that are
[45:52.030 --> 45:56.830]  too stubborn to come to the light, you can see them struggling and dwindling and falling off.
[45:57.950 --> 46:02.990]  I saw it a couple of years ago, the people I knew that were living right on the, the edge
[46:03.790 --> 46:08.390]  between the black and the white market, like the, what you'd call the gray market. Um,
[46:08.470 --> 46:13.670]  the more stores that opened up, the harder it was to compete with them. I mean,
[46:14.550 --> 46:21.830]  the guy that had one strain for you in March come July would show up a seven by December.
[46:21.830 --> 46:27.750]  There was a selection of hash in his bag too. Um, and by January it was just too much of a
[46:27.750 --> 46:31.750]  fucking hassle regardless of the selection, because you could just go to a store and pick,
[46:31.750 --> 46:36.390]  right? Like you never had to hang out and not seem like foot traffic or any of that.
[46:36.630 --> 46:41.190]  Meet somebody somewhere. How much, how many episodes of how it's made would never have been
[46:41.190 --> 46:46.470]  watched if we could just buy weed in stores, deadliest catch would have never been viewed.
[46:47.110 --> 46:50.710]  Yeah. Right. Viewership on a lot of shit would go way down if you didn't have to hang out with
[46:50.710 --> 46:55.750]  your weed dealer for two hours. So you didn't seem like you were there buying weed. Um, this
[46:55.750 --> 46:59.430]  dude's just really, really bored. And a lot of his friends come to visit for two hours at a
[46:59.430 --> 47:03.750]  chunk, I guess. Yeah. We just play Xbox all day. Like it's just so much more convenient,
[47:03.990 --> 47:09.350]  even when you get to the shop and you're like, really, that's the price fucking taxes. Like you
[47:09.350 --> 47:13.830]  start wondering how much your time's worth. Like how many hours did I spend sitting on the couch,
[47:13.830 --> 47:17.990]  listening to bullshit? Because I was there to buy a bag of weed and that was the best weed in town.
[47:17.990 --> 47:21.590]  Yeah. Cause every weed dealer wants to show you his new thing that he bought with your money that
[47:21.590 --> 47:26.630]  you spent there. It's like, dude, I'm not into ukuleles, but all right, I'll see you. Look at
[47:26.630 --> 47:30.550]  my new didgeridoo, man. Anything but more fucking deadliest catch.
[47:30.630 --> 47:33.750]  I don't know why I'm kicking that show. I like that show. Yeah. I don't know why I used to get
[47:33.750 --> 47:37.510]  stoned to watch the fuck out of some deadliest catch. That's really weird. Hey, it's, it's fun.
[47:37.510 --> 47:41.590]  Wonder which one's going to get squashed by a crab cage next. I'm going to write myself a note
[47:41.590 --> 47:48.150]  here. This is not show related. Watch more deadliest catch. No, I record another podcast
[47:48.150 --> 47:53.110]  and I have a deadliest catch story that I want to tell on that podcast. There's an episode where
[47:53.110 --> 47:57.270]  Jeff's in it. People. No, no. I'm kidding. Do you want to tell a story? I'm kidding.
[47:58.230 --> 48:02.790]  No, no. I'm kidding. Do you want to tell this weird ass dream story on this podcast? I mean,
[48:02.790 --> 48:06.950]  this show is almost a fucking hour long here. Just read all these people. So let's talk about
[48:06.950 --> 48:10.710]  this. One time I got my wisdom teeth removed and they gave me Vicodin and I took too many of them
[48:10.710 --> 48:14.310]  and I fell asleep watching deadliest catch. Okay. That's like the main setup here.
[48:14.310 --> 48:20.230]  I woke up in a dream that I would caught somebody trying to kill people on the deadliest catch boat.
[48:20.230 --> 48:23.990]  And I murdered him because he was trying to kill me. And in self-defense, I killed the
[48:23.990 --> 48:27.270]  motherfucker because he killed everybody else on the boat. But then I realized everybody on the
[48:27.270 --> 48:31.030]  boat is dead, but me. And they're going to think I did this shit and I'm all covered in blood and
[48:31.030 --> 48:34.230]  the boat's all covered in blood. So I got to get the fuck out of here. And then I wake up.
[48:34.230 --> 48:38.550]  And since I took too many Vicodin before I fell asleep, when I woke up, I didn't really wake up.
[48:38.550 --> 48:41.830]  I was still dreaming, but I was physically sitting up in real life. But in dream life,
[48:41.830 --> 48:45.750]  I was still in my boat and I saw blood all over my house. And it took me a good,
[48:46.470 --> 48:49.830]  I don't really know, but I'm gonna say like three or four minutes of like shaking my head around and
[48:49.830 --> 48:53.430]  walking around my bedroom going, why is there blood everywhere? What the fuck is happening?
[48:53.430 --> 48:58.630]  And then finally the blood faded away and I woke up. Don't too many, don't do too many Vicodin kids.
[48:58.630 --> 49:02.230]  That's my, that's my fucking theory. But I had my wisdom teeth taken out and they fucking hurt,
[49:02.230 --> 49:06.870]  dude. That shit sucks. Okay. I was kind of listening, but while I was listening,
[49:06.870 --> 49:09.910]  I had a thought. Okay. Let's hear your thought. This has been rambly as fuck.
[49:10.550 --> 49:16.230]  So if you're still listening, I'll go ahead and pay to send you a sticker pack or some shit.

[49:30.710 --> 49:35.670]  I'll we'll pick like three and I'll pay to send you t-shirts. We got stickers. We got plenty of
[49:35.670 --> 49:39.350]  stickers. I don't know that they'll, what they'll be, but we've got stickers. I've got so many
[49:39.350 --> 49:42.950]  sponsors and vendors and friends that we, I've got, we'll send you something really cool. Yeah.

[50:10.950 --> 50:15.910]  everywhere. It did go everywhere, but I like it though. Sometimes dabs take you fun places. Yes,
[50:15.910 --> 50:19.510]  they do. Well, since Mike's a Mike's given away shit, I'm going to wrap up the show before he

[53:23.830 --> 53:27.910]  the quality of I read genetics, colorado.com. That is under construction. My friend is a college
[53:27.910 --> 53:31.910]  student. Will you work on that when he's not in college? Uh, let the man get an education.
[53:31.910 --> 53:35.110]  That's first. And when he's not there, he'll come over and we'll work on the website.
[53:35.110 --> 53:37.830]  Go to school, Tony, do your thing. Don't worry about it. We got your back, bro.
[53:37.830 --> 53:42.230]  While we're on it. If you're in a position to hire somebody who needs to work like a couple of weeks
[53:42.230 --> 53:46.310]  a year, hire a college student who needs a little help getting through school. I like it when you
[53:46.310 --> 53:50.710]  ramble. Yep. All right, you guys, I'm gonna wrap up this show. Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[53:50.710 --> 53:54.790]  Thanks to everybody for listening. What the hell just tickled my arm? That's a spider or something.
[53:54.790 --> 53:59.670]  God, that scared the shit out of me. It was a dreadlock. How are you not used to that? How
[53:59.670 --> 54:03.590]  does that one reach over there? That was weird. So high. Your body cares about your dreadlocks.
[54:03.590 --> 54:08.230]  Again, just tickled. That was strange. Anyway, you guys, uh, we're dabbed the fuck out. I hope
[54:08.230 --> 54:12.070]  you had a lot of fun with us. Hashtag. I like it when you ramble, get your sticker pack.
[54:12.070 --> 54:15.670]  See, wasn't that a good idea? Big shout outs, men in dispense. Thanks again for listening guys.
[54:15.670 --> 54:19.510]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
