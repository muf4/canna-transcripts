[00:11.770 --> 00:16.190]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is
[00:16.190 --> 00:21.010]  time for episode 589 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. You know I like to
[00:21.010 --> 00:24.970]  start the show off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs
[00:24.970 --> 00:29.970]  of Cake Face batter from Binsk. In my opinion this tastes like diesel fuel and
[00:29.970 --> 00:33.930]  cake batter. Maybe if you went and got some diesel fuel in the truck, drove home
[00:33.930 --> 00:37.130]  whipped up a little cake batter and then smelled your fingers it would taste like
[00:37.130 --> 00:42.090]  a sweet diesel fuel cake batter and I find it delightful. On the back of the
[00:42.090 --> 00:48.610]  package it says it contains 71.82% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD just
[00:48.610 --> 00:52.530]  the way I like a concentrate. So big shout out to our friends at Binsk for
[00:52.530 --> 00:57.890]  the delicious Cake Face live batter. Alright in this episode I'm going to
[00:57.890 --> 01:00.930]  talk about a power outage I experienced. We're gonna talk a little bit about
[01:00.930 --> 01:04.970]  curing our medicine. Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few folks

[02:11.010 --> 02:14.010]  Alright, thank you guys for all the patreon support. It does mean a lot to me.
[02:14.010 --> 02:18.970]  Also, thank you for all of the feedback I got on the last podcast episode. I did an
[02:18.970 --> 02:22.510]  episode thanking you guys for all the love and support. Just like a good
[02:22.510 --> 02:25.990]  audience, just like a bunch of good friends. You guys came back and sent me a
[02:25.990 --> 02:29.530]  bunch of love, a bunch of thanks, a bunch of words of encouragement. So thank you.
[02:29.530 --> 02:33.450]  That stuff meant a lot to me. Thank you for all the feedback from the last
[02:33.450 --> 02:39.970]  episode. Also, thank you for all of the feedback on the errors and mistakes I
[02:39.970 --> 02:44.650]  have made in the past couple of episodes. I'm gonna man up to it right here. I have
[02:44.650 --> 02:50.450]  made so many typos and small errors in the podcast on the past few episodes. Not
[02:50.450 --> 02:54.970]  a lot of big mistakes but a couple of just numbers. One time it was 87 and I
[02:54.970 --> 02:59.770]  said 83 or something like that. I've done a few typos. If you're watching the
[02:59.770 --> 03:03.810]  videos, I spell patreon wrong all the fucking time. Just small details like
[03:03.810 --> 03:08.050]  that. I guess I need to stop taking so many dabs after I finish the show and
[03:08.050 --> 03:11.810]  then go to edit. Maybe one last dab between finishing and editing the show
[03:11.810 --> 03:15.890]  so I can get my shit together. I do apologize for all of the typos, the
[03:15.890 --> 03:19.370]  misspeaking, but I didn't fuck up the audio in the video. The video looks good
[03:19.370 --> 03:22.470]  and it sounds real good and that's what I've been focused on. So I will get my
[03:22.470 --> 03:25.950]  shit together. I will get my brains back in my head and we will say the correct
[03:25.950 --> 03:29.990]  numbers. I'll say the correct things. I know that you guys are relying on me to
[03:29.990 --> 03:32.830]  guide you in a certain way and I don't want to say the wrong thing and mess up
[03:32.830 --> 03:36.590]  your garden. So if I fucked you up in any sort of way, I apologize. I'm gonna man up
[03:36.590 --> 03:41.110]  to it right here. I'm human. I woke up this morning and I had to pee. Sometimes
[03:41.110 --> 03:44.810]  I sneeze. Sometimes I stutter. I say a lot of silly, embarrassing shit. I'm a human.
[03:44.810 --> 03:48.630]  I'm going to make mistakes. I apologize for the mistakes I have made and please
[03:48.630 --> 03:52.190]  forgive me for the mistakes that I will make in the future because I promise you
[03:52.190 --> 03:56.190]  I'm gonna fuck up again. I'm not done fucking up. I'm not gonna try, but I
[03:56.190 --> 03:58.990]  promise you I'm gonna keep fucking up. That's how I get better. That's how you get
[03:58.990 --> 04:02.670]  better. With support from our friends, friendly encouragement, friendly
[04:02.670 --> 04:05.630]  pointing out that we fucked up, we will get better through it together. So don't
[04:05.630 --> 04:08.910]  be shy. If you see me make any mistakes, if I say some weird shit, if there are
[04:08.910 --> 04:12.950]  typos, typos in the podcast episodes, that's pretty much too late. But if you
[04:12.950 --> 04:16.370]  want to let me know that I've made a typo, some sort of error, I encourage it.
[04:16.370 --> 04:20.550]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. If that's too
[04:20.630 --> 04:24.510]  much for you to remember, I invite you to go check out my website. On the website

[05:00.550 --> 05:04.070]  the old logo that is replenished. The shirts are brand new. The logo itself is
[05:04.070 --> 05:09.750]  not brand new. That original Colorado flag logo, it is back. Go to iRegenetics.com,
[05:09.750 --> 05:13.710]  click on the store. I will take you right there. You can check out the iRegenetics

[06:07.630 --> 06:11.230]  a big shout out to my buddy Handmade. Big shout out to my buddy Adam at
[06:11.230 --> 06:14.990]  Handmade Apparel. They're the ones that printed the Ivory logo shirts and the
[06:14.990 --> 06:19.510]  GFYH t-shirts and they look fucking stellar. The shirts are so bright. The
[06:19.510 --> 06:24.550]  colors are so bold. The logos are super vivid. I am impressed. So shout
[06:24.550 --> 06:29.550]  out to Adam at Handmade Apparel. Quick turnaround time, great quality and very
[06:29.550 --> 06:33.190]  affordable shirts. Thank you. They're gonna look good on people. I should have
[06:33.190 --> 06:37.830]  been wearing one today but I think I am trying not to wear graphic tees as much.
[06:37.830 --> 06:41.910]  Not my own brand. I don't want to wear my brand. I may wear your brand but it's
[06:41.910 --> 06:44.910]  almost I've grown out of wearing my brand. It feels a little bit silly
[06:44.910 --> 06:48.270]  sometimes when they go Rasta Jeff of iRegenetics and I'm wearing a fucking
[06:48.270 --> 06:51.470]  iRegenetics t-shirt. I'm not a cartoon character. I'm not a comic book hero. I
[06:51.470 --> 06:54.630]  don't need to have my own logo on my chest all the time but sometimes it's
[06:54.630 --> 06:59.150]  acceptable I guess. Anyway, I'm rambling and chattery today. Shout out to our
[06:59.150 --> 07:01.710]  friends at Binsk for the fucking concentrates. They got me high as shit
[07:01.710 --> 07:06.310]  and made me rambly. I enjoy it. Let's try to get me back on track. Where are we
[07:06.310 --> 07:10.270]  headed with this podcast? It is my job to keep this thing on the rails. Here we
[07:10.270 --> 07:14.230]  go. This is what we're gonna talk about now. Recently the power went out where I
[07:14.230 --> 07:19.270]  grow. I wasn't here or I wasn't there and I showed up at the grow. The whole
[07:19.270 --> 07:22.510]  neighborhood was dark. I was like huh something's going on. Pulled up. It was
[07:22.510 --> 07:26.270]  dark. None of the normal sounds you hear in the grow were happening. I went to
[07:26.270 --> 07:29.830]  where the grow is. The clone machine was not bubbling. That was my number one
[07:29.830 --> 07:36.230]  concern. I've got an easy cloner going. Usually I hear that constant. It just
[07:36.230 --> 07:39.630]  never stops. There's always the sound of that just a whirring watering thing
[07:39.630 --> 07:44.590]  happening. It's always going. I did not hear that so I went into a light panic
[07:44.590 --> 07:47.430]  mode. I wouldn't say a major panic mode. I did go into a light panic and I said
[07:47.430 --> 07:52.150]  shit the cloner is not working. I wonder how long that's been going. I noticed all
[07:52.150 --> 07:55.510]  the lights were out. The air conditioner was out. The fans were not blowing.
[07:55.510 --> 08:00.190]  Everything was shut down. The cloner was my major concern like I've said but this
[08:00.190 --> 08:04.190]  made me think maybe I should tell our friends what we could do in the
[08:04.190 --> 08:10.150]  situation of a power outage. The number one thing I thought of is to remind you
[08:10.150 --> 08:14.630]  to buy digital timers. When you're buying timers for your grow you've got the
[08:14.630 --> 08:18.350]  opportunity to buy digital timers with the battery backup or you can buy those
[08:18.350 --> 08:22.310]  shitty timers with the little pegs that you push down and then they turn you
[08:22.310 --> 08:25.670]  plug them in and they turn and as time goes by those pegs are either up or down
[08:25.670 --> 08:30.910]  and those pegs tell it to be off or on. Those are fine but when the power goes
[08:30.910 --> 08:36.350]  out those timers stop spinning so those little pegs nothing happens while the
[08:36.350 --> 08:40.150]  time time is out. While the power is out nothing happens. That timer quits
[08:40.150 --> 08:44.430]  turning so when the power comes back on it resumes where it is. So if you're in
[08:44.430 --> 08:47.670]  the middle of your flowering cycle and the timer goes off you're six hours into
[08:47.670 --> 08:53.030]  flower and your flowering day power goes off power comes on anytime later we're
[08:53.030 --> 08:56.390]  gonna say three hours later. Now your timer is gonna kick back on and it's
[08:56.390 --> 09:00.190]  going to continue this six hour day cycle that you've got programmed because
[09:00.190 --> 09:04.150]  time stood still on your timer while time kept moving in the real world. On
[09:04.150 --> 09:08.350]  the Babylon clock time kept moving on the Sun clock time kept moving on your
[09:08.350 --> 09:12.010]  little broken timer with the power outage time stayed still. So when the
[09:12.010 --> 09:15.870]  time comes back on all of your cycles all of your routines all of your rhythms
[09:15.870 --> 09:19.510]  are now fucked. Nothing is the way you expected it to be. You've got to go back
[09:19.510 --> 09:24.030]  and manually readjust the time on that timer or it's going to be off until you
[09:24.030 --> 09:28.430]  fix it and sometimes the power goes off and you're not at the place where the
[09:28.430 --> 09:31.790]  power goes off. Maybe I didn't show up at that grow in time and the power came
[09:31.790 --> 09:34.990]  back on and it had been off for four hours I never would have known that
[09:34.990 --> 09:38.590]  timer would have adjusted itself four hours so my grow would have been off
[09:38.590 --> 09:42.270]  everything would have been mistimed by four hours and that could that could
[09:42.270 --> 09:47.710]  destroy everything. So buy the digital timer with a battery backup that way
[09:47.710 --> 09:51.350]  when the power goes out if the power were to go out here and I had that timer
[09:51.350 --> 09:54.710]  plugged in behind me it would keep ticking it would follow the normal
[09:54.710 --> 09:57.890]  Babylon clock it would follow the rest of it follow my cell phone because my
[09:57.890 --> 10:01.490]  phone doesn't die when the power goes out that clock keeps going so would my
[10:01.490 --> 10:06.170]  battery backup clock that way when the power does come back on it can it'll stay
[10:06.170 --> 10:09.770]  on the same schedule when the power goes off it does not continue to run my light
[10:09.770 --> 10:12.610]  with the backup battery don't think that's what the backup battery is for
[10:12.610 --> 10:16.690]  that backup battery is to keep the time at the same time then when the power
[10:16.690 --> 10:20.770]  comes back on it is still whatever time it is on your phone on the Babylon
[10:20.770 --> 10:25.070]  clock it's that time still on your timer all of your cycles are set where they
[10:25.070 --> 10:28.990]  should be you shouldn't miss a beat other than that time that it was off so
[10:28.990 --> 10:32.670]  I hope I made that point clearly because that was a lot of fucking rambling once
[10:32.670 --> 10:37.230]  again shout out to the Debs buy digital timers if you have got the opportunity
[10:37.230 --> 10:41.270]  digital digital timers are much better than the analog timers that stick and
[10:41.270 --> 10:45.430]  don't keep flowing when the time cuts out when the power cuts out time stops
[10:45.430 --> 10:49.910]  on those so get yourself a digital timer and stay correct on your time now where
[10:49.910 --> 10:52.950]  do we go from there I keep mentioning that easy cloner that was the thing that
[10:52.950 --> 10:56.790]  made me panic the most I ran and I checked the easy cloner I lifted it up
[10:56.790 --> 11:00.350]  and I touched the roots of the plants they were barely starting to root they
[11:00.350 --> 11:04.310]  were wet they were moist they were not dripping with water like I would like
[11:04.310 --> 11:07.670]  them to be but they had moisture to them which means they were going to survive
[11:07.670 --> 11:12.350]  so that power couldn't have been out for very long so what I do with my power
[11:12.350 --> 11:15.750]  cloner with my easy cloner turbo cloner power cloner all of those electric
[11:15.750 --> 11:19.870]  cloners that spray water from the bottom if your power does go out my advice to
[11:19.870 --> 11:23.670]  you is about every 30 minutes to an hour lift that lid up and just use a
[11:23.670 --> 11:27.950]  spray bottle and spray those roots spray those where they would normally get
[11:27.950 --> 11:31.710]  misted spray them just manually go in there with the spray bottle and spray
[11:31.710 --> 11:35.070]  the shit out of them if you need to scoop up some of the water that is in
[11:35.070 --> 11:38.710]  the cloner and use that water as your spray just go ahead and spray them that
[11:38.710 --> 11:42.150]  way the roots stay nice and wet or the root zone where the roots are going to
[11:42.150 --> 11:45.990]  happen stay nice and wet and you don't kill off your clones spray them every 30
[11:45.990 --> 11:50.270]  45 minutes just keep them wet maybe once every hour and they will survive so
[11:50.270 --> 11:54.390]  that is a way to keep the easy cloner the turbo cloners alive now if you are
[11:54.390 --> 11:58.990]  missing light hours that's okay the power went off while I was gone that is
[11:58.990 --> 12:03.710]  okay you cannot have power the lights come on during the dark cycle that is a
[12:03.710 --> 12:08.150]  problem having the lights go off during the darks during the day cycle if the
[12:08.150 --> 12:11.790]  lights go off during the day cycle all you're really losing is that
[12:11.790 --> 12:15.910]  photosynthetic energy you're not getting the photons the energy the light energy
[12:15.910 --> 12:19.270]  from the from the light that day so your plants are gonna lack that little
[12:19.270 --> 12:23.950]  bit but it's not as detrimental as if you were getting interruptions in the
[12:23.950 --> 12:29.550]  dark period so you can miss a few hours one thing I did notice quickly very
[12:29.550 --> 12:34.190]  quickly the temperature and humidity of my grow spaces went out of control it
[12:34.190 --> 12:37.910]  was really humid in there it was really stagnant it was quite funky the
[12:37.910 --> 12:41.470]  temperature was moving around I could feel the humidity in there however I
[12:41.470 --> 12:44.910]  couldn't tell you what the temperature or humidity are because the devices I
[12:44.910 --> 12:49.550]  use are attached to a plug-in device and when the power went out they were no
[12:49.550 --> 12:52.790]  longer powered I didn't know what was happening in that room for that period
[12:52.790 --> 12:56.070]  of time when the power came back on all my monitors came back on but my
[12:56.070 --> 12:59.950]  monitoring devices are powered by electricity and when the power went out
[12:59.950 --> 13:03.830]  so did my device so I don't know what happened in that room during that power
[13:03.830 --> 13:07.230]  outage it could have been a hundred and whatever degrees it could have been four
[13:07.230 --> 13:11.230]  degrees I don't know it could have been 50% humidity it could have been 90% I
[13:11.230 --> 13:14.710]  don't know I could only tell you that I could feel it it was damp in there and
[13:14.710 --> 13:18.950]  it was funky so everything went out of control the humidity the temperature it
[13:18.950 --> 13:23.470]  was all wacky for quite a while all you can do is fucking hope for the best in
[13:23.470 --> 13:26.550]  that situation I don't know what happened because I didn't have a monitor
[13:26.550 --> 13:31.230]  what I can say is hope for it to get back on schedule as soon as possible
[13:31.230 --> 13:35.150]  when that power comes on go and check all of your timers go check all of your
[13:35.150 --> 13:39.190]  settings and make sure everything is set exactly how you thought it was check
[13:39.190 --> 13:42.950]  your light timer check all of your pumps if you're running hydro check all of
[13:42.950 --> 13:46.550]  those pumps check all of your fans check your air conditioner anything that
[13:46.550 --> 13:50.710]  plugs in that can fuck up check it when the power goes out because it probably
[13:50.710 --> 13:54.870]  did fuck up where are we gonna go from here I've got a lot of notes I feel like
[13:54.870 --> 13:59.630]  I skipped something oh if the power keeps going off and on it was happening
[13:59.630 --> 14:03.070]  here I think they were working on it down the street so if the power goes off
[14:03.070 --> 14:06.430]  and on if it's like on for a few minutes and then it shuts off and then it comes
[14:06.430 --> 14:10.070]  on it shuts off and you know it's gonna keep doing that just unplug everything
[14:10.070 --> 14:13.190]  if you can flip the breaker flip the fucking breaker to stop the power to
[14:13.190 --> 14:17.830]  that room because it is very stressful on your grow lights maybe some of the
[14:17.830 --> 14:22.190]  modern LEDs will handle it but your HPS and your halide and your sodium lights
[14:22.190 --> 14:27.990]  they're not gonna handle off and on cycles that rapidly very well excuse me
[14:27.990 --> 14:30.830]  got to clear my throat here they're not gonna handle the off and on very well
[14:30.830 --> 14:34.590]  it would be better for your equipment just to unplug it let it be off for a
[14:34.590 --> 14:37.750]  couple of hours once you're sure they've got their shit fixed then plug it back
[14:37.870 --> 14:41.190]  in and get it running that'll be better for your equipment and probably better
[14:41.190 --> 14:45.790]  for the plants you don't want jumping humidity spikes you don't want humidity
[14:45.790 --> 14:49.310]  dips you don't want hot and cold all day and the plants are not gonna know what
[14:49.310 --> 14:52.070]  to do with that that's gonna cause you powdery mildew issues that's gonna cause
[14:52.070 --> 14:56.630]  problems slower growth it's gonna fuck things up in the grow also that's gonna
[14:56.630 --> 15:00.190]  mess up your bulbs those bulbs only get so many strike times for them to come on
[15:00.190 --> 15:04.550]  if you have to strike it six times today plus hot starts are not good that'll
[15:04.550 --> 15:07.470]  slow down your ballast performance and your bulb so it may be best just to
[15:07.470 --> 15:11.750]  unplug it and make sure it doesn't keep going off and on I'm making sure I've
[15:11.750 --> 15:16.350]  got all my notes covered here um so make sure you reset everything when it comes
[15:16.350 --> 15:20.270]  back on like I said before everything that can fuck up when the power goes off
[15:20.270 --> 15:23.550]  will fuck up when the power goes off you've got to get everything back in
[15:23.550 --> 15:27.630]  sync don't just assume that that fan is gonna come back on when you think it
[15:27.630 --> 15:30.550]  should that air conditioner will come on that those bubblers will cycle as you
[15:30.550 --> 15:34.990]  think so go ahead and check them part of being a good grower and being an okay
[15:34.990 --> 15:38.630]  grower is that high for detail did you bother to go check on all the settings
[15:38.630 --> 15:41.830]  did you bother to go make sure that things were correct or did you just
[15:41.830 --> 15:46.110]  assume hope and pray because assuming hoping and praying might not get you
[15:46.110 --> 15:49.070]  there if you physically got your stoned ass up off the couch and went look do
[15:49.070 --> 15:52.310]  you know it's good you've only got yourself to blame put some pride into
[15:52.310 --> 15:56.550]  your work set yourself up for success go check on that shit dude it's that easy
[15:56.550 --> 16:01.150]  I'm in love with my plants I'm in love with my garden so if I hear something
[16:01.150 --> 16:03.910]  make the wrong noise I'm in there looking like what made that noise what
[16:03.910 --> 16:09.150]  happened I can hear from the garage from the driveway I can hear the cycles
[16:09.150 --> 16:11.950]  of the house and I know what should be happening and if I hear the wrong noise
[16:11.950 --> 16:15.190]  before I'm even to the door I know there's a problem that's how much I know
[16:15.190 --> 16:20.190]  my grow the other thing I wanted to mention on this part is daylight
[16:20.190 --> 16:24.710]  savings time we just adjusted a couple of weeks ago to daylight savings time my
[16:24.710 --> 16:28.590]  question for you is did you adjust your grow room or did you adjust your life to
[16:28.590 --> 16:32.110]  it because those plants didn't care that it was daylight savings time they've
[16:32.110 --> 16:35.670]  been on 1212 for so long did you fucking change that or did you just let
[16:35.670 --> 16:39.430]  it ride send me an email grow from your heart at hotmail.com let me know what
[16:39.430 --> 16:42.390]  you did for daylight savings time and what can you what are you gonna do when
[16:42.390 --> 16:45.910]  it comes back because a lot of us have our lights scheduled right before you
[16:45.910 --> 16:49.230]  leave for work you got an hour when the lights come on so you can water them or
[16:49.230 --> 16:52.390]  maybe they come on right when you get home from work how are you adjusting to
[16:52.390 --> 16:55.630]  daylight savings time did you adjust your life or did you just go in there
[16:55.630 --> 16:59.230]  and straight up change the fucking timer in the middle of a flowering cycle let
[16:59.230 --> 17:03.110]  me know what you did grow from your heart at hotmail.com all right podcast
[17:03.110 --> 17:07.150]  world this is the part of the show where I read a message from patreon once again
[17:07.150 --> 17:11.310]  I do encourage you to support the show on patreon at patreon.com forward slash
[17:11.310 --> 17:15.670]  grow from your heart today's patreon message goes a lot like this it says
[17:15.670 --> 17:19.070]  what's up Rasta Jeff and what's up Mike you hear it Mike you're getting a shout
[17:19.070 --> 17:22.910]  out I invite you to be back on the show it goes like this it says I just did a
[17:22.910 --> 17:26.990]  fat dab and I gave my mom a hug and now I've got a quick question that is
[17:26.990 --> 17:30.990]  perfect the question goes like this have you ever heard of the paper bag
[17:30.990 --> 17:35.150]  method we have recently started using the paper bag method and it seems to be
[17:35.150 --> 17:38.870]  working out pretty well the only thing I'm running into is that I'm still
[17:38.870 --> 17:43.990]  having a little bit of a green taste to it seven days after being in the bag so
[17:43.990 --> 17:47.450]  I need to let it cure for another seven to fourteen days or let it dry in the
[17:47.450 --> 17:51.550]  bag for another three to seven days I hope to hear from you soon this may be
[17:51.550 --> 17:55.670]  only the only month I can give ten bucks because I need to save up for some of
[17:55.670 --> 18:00.310]  your genetics from your friend Jake hey Jake don't stress bro if you can't
[18:00.310 --> 18:03.830]  support the show on patreon I do understand it is voluntary it is not
[18:03.830 --> 18:07.910]  mandatory I do appreciate the support you're giving us now and it is time to
[18:07.910 --> 18:11.270]  get you some seeds bro I'd rather see you growing seeds in your garden that's
[18:11.270 --> 18:15.310]  supporting me on patreon because the seeds will give back I'm gonna give to
[18:15.310 --> 18:19.110]  you for free grow some seeds and then when you can come find me on patreon
[18:19.110 --> 18:23.150]  again no hard feelings thank you for the great message thank you for the patreon
[18:23.150 --> 18:27.670]  support now let's talk about this paper bag method I've heard of the paper bag
[18:27.670 --> 18:32.230]  method what is the paper bag method that is drying and curing basically curing
[18:32.230 --> 18:36.350]  our cannabis in a brown paper bag a lot of people will cut the plants down
[18:36.350 --> 18:40.190]  they'll let them hang until they're dry until the stem snap a little bit they do
[18:40.190 --> 18:44.230]  it perfectly right up until then then when it comes to the curing process they
[18:44.230 --> 18:48.750]  put them in a brown paper bag that brown paper bag is then rolled up and sealed
[18:48.750 --> 18:52.470]  up at the end some people put it in the refrigerator some people leave it in a
[18:52.470 --> 18:57.550]  cool dry dark area some people do it different ways however I don't approve
[18:57.550 --> 19:02.190]  or like the brown paper bag method because it leaves a brown paper bag
[19:02.190 --> 19:06.990]  flavor to your buds that is why I highly always recommend drying and curing in
[19:06.990 --> 19:12.030]  either glass if you can or in plastic in a large commercial environment I will
[19:12.030 --> 19:15.830]  cure in a plastic container a very big plastic container we'll talk about that
[19:15.830 --> 19:20.790]  in a moment but I think that your product tastes like green and brown
[19:20.790 --> 19:26.150]  paper bag because you are drying and curing in a brown paper bag the idea is
[19:26.150 --> 19:32.390]  to get the chlorophyll to release from those buds so the moisture and the air
[19:32.390 --> 19:36.950]  create a gas inside that environment when you seal that bag up there's a an
[19:36.950 --> 19:41.150]  anaerobic gas is created in there that gas will eat the chlorophyll that
[19:41.150 --> 19:44.750]  chlorophyll then becomes a vapor and needs to escape from the environment
[19:44.750 --> 19:49.510]  it's not escaping it is getting stuck in your brown paper bag it is staying right
[19:49.510 --> 19:54.390]  there and that flavor is just sticking to your buds if you wrap those buds in
[19:54.390 --> 19:58.430]  something that a sushi roll those buds are gonna taste like a sushi roll if you
[19:58.430 --> 20:02.070]  wrap them in a wet towel they'll taste like a wet towel if you wrap your dried
[20:02.070 --> 20:05.110]  buds in a blunt wrap they taste like shit sorry that's my opinion I just
[20:05.110 --> 20:08.590]  wanted to throw that out there if you wrap your wet buds in a brown paper bag
[20:08.590 --> 20:11.710]  they're going to taste like a brown paper bag and chlorophyll so that's why
[20:11.710 --> 20:16.550]  I believe you are getting this non desirable flavor and aroma I never ever
[20:16.710 --> 20:21.550]  recommend drying in cardboard or paper bags or anything like that that paper
[20:21.550 --> 20:25.590]  material will hold the moisture that moisture will hold the chlorophyll that
[20:25.590 --> 20:30.070]  chlorophyll will put that flavor right back into your buds so I prefer I
[20:30.070 --> 20:33.990]  recommend drying in glass or large plastic containers the way you want to
[20:33.990 --> 20:37.470]  do it and this is just a quick method of how I would recommend doing it cut the
[20:37.470 --> 20:41.390]  plants down get the big leaves off of them let them hang and tell the stem
[20:41.390 --> 20:45.790]  snap you want those stems popping not exploding but cracking at that point
[20:45.790 --> 20:49.270]  trim them you want I prefer a dry trim I think it's much easier it's much
[20:49.270 --> 20:53.910]  quicker it's not as messy I just think it's much more efficient so hang them
[20:53.910 --> 20:58.910]  take off the big leaves let them dry cut it into smaller pieces and trim it up at
[20:58.910 --> 21:04.670]  that point put it into a glass jar fill the glass jar about 90% of the way full
[21:04.670 --> 21:10.750]  you want some room for air in there put those buds in the jar I am very OCD also
[21:10.750 --> 21:15.150]  I'm very committed to my grow I'm able to do these things I set a timer for 30
[21:15.230 --> 21:19.790]  minutes when I first put them in the jar seal up that jar 30 minutes 30 minutes
[21:19.790 --> 21:22.950]  later I come back I dump them out of the jar let those buds sit for a minute make
[21:22.950 --> 21:27.150]  sure they're not too sticky too tacky too wet if I agree if I believe that
[21:27.150 --> 21:30.710]  they are the appropriate moisture level to put back in the jar they go back in
[21:30.710 --> 21:35.150]  the jar I seal it up now I set my alarm for about an hour I come back I check in
[21:35.150 --> 21:39.030]  an hour pour the buds out of the jar feel them are they ready to go back in
[21:39.030 --> 21:43.150]  the jar maybe I jarred too early this is my opportunity to say I'm gonna fuck
[21:43.150 --> 21:46.590]  this up I'm not gonna put them back in the jar yet so I'll let them sit out
[21:46.590 --> 21:49.750]  until I feel like they're right this is kind of an art form you have to learn
[21:49.750 --> 21:53.430]  this they don't want to be so wet that the buds if you squeeze them you don't
[21:53.430 --> 21:57.350]  want it to stay flattened you want it spongy to where it pops back up but you
[21:57.350 --> 22:00.990]  also don't want it so dry that when you squeeze it it turns to dust you want to
[22:00.990 --> 22:04.270]  put it in there to where there's enough moisture in the jar to trigger the
[22:04.270 --> 22:08.070]  reaction to make the anaerobes eat the chlorophyll but you don't want it so
[22:08.070 --> 22:11.670]  moist in there that you're going to create a moldy environment so now is
[22:11.670 --> 22:15.270]  your opportunity to check it out check it the first hour if it's appropriate
[22:15.270 --> 22:19.630]  put it back in the jar if not let it sit if it sits out for a while catch up with
[22:19.630 --> 22:22.950]  us to this step put it back in the jar we've all got our buds dried
[22:22.950 --> 22:26.830]  appropriately put them back in the jar set a timer I'm gonna set a timer for
[22:26.830 --> 22:30.950]  another hour depending on how the sticky those buds were one to two hours I'm
[22:30.950 --> 22:34.230]  gonna come back and check on them at this point we are starting the curing
[22:34.230 --> 22:37.510]  process they're not too moist I'm sure they're not too moist they can go in the
[22:37.510 --> 22:41.390]  jar for an extended time I'm gonna check on them every four hours for the next
[22:41.390 --> 22:46.830]  two days pop open that jar let it sit for 10 maybe 20 minutes depending on the
[22:46.830 --> 22:51.470]  level of moisture and the aromas that come out of that jar if it still feels
[22:51.470 --> 22:56.110]  sticky and moist when you touch the buds give it a little more time if they're
[22:56.110 --> 23:01.550]  starting to dry out don't give it so much time then slowly increase your time
[23:01.550 --> 23:06.750]  that it's left in that jar you can go from four hours to six hours to eight to
[23:06.750 --> 23:13.070]  12 eventually 24 36 48 hours before you burp that jar don't leave it closed too
[23:13.070 --> 23:18.150]  long too early is the major thing to look at if you can do multiple jars if
[23:18.150 --> 23:21.790]  you can set up like four or five jars from your harvest and only open this one
[23:21.790 --> 23:26.310]  every so often and this one longer and this one longer maybe maybe see what
[23:26.310 --> 23:29.710]  happens if you do longer and shorter periods you've got to experiment a
[23:29.710 --> 23:33.670]  little bit with curing I wish I could give you perfect parameters but your
[23:33.670 --> 23:36.990]  environment is what is going to play the most into your drying and curing
[23:36.990 --> 23:42.550]  differences it's I'm in Colorado it's cold and dry here I can dry and cure
[23:42.550 --> 23:46.870]  herb super quickly if you're in Florida it's gonna be super moist it's gonna
[23:46.870 --> 23:51.030]  take a lot longer for your herb to dry so your environment and how wet the buds
[23:51.030 --> 23:54.630]  were when they went into the curing container are going to determine how
[23:54.630 --> 23:59.190]  often and how soon you need to open those jars so don't let my advice fuck
[23:59.190 --> 24:03.190]  you up if you're in a if you got wetter buds do it sooner and more often if
[24:03.190 --> 24:07.910]  they're drier do it less and longer intervals that's my advice so I said I
[24:07.910 --> 24:13.550]  would do it in large plastic containers if I had a lot of product I am known for
[24:13.550 --> 24:17.190]  running commercial cultivation facilities I'm a commercial cultivation
[24:17.190 --> 24:20.910]  consultant you can hire me I will go to your commercial cultivation facility
[24:20.910 --> 24:25.030]  I'll spend a day there looking at your grow seeing what kind of strategy you
[24:25.030 --> 24:28.750]  have seeing what kind of standard operating procedures you are using I'll
[24:28.750 --> 24:32.510]  learn the staff a little bit I'll see who is on top of their game in the staff
[24:32.510 --> 24:36.190]  I'll see where your weakest link is and I can make recommendations on how to
[24:36.190 --> 24:39.750]  improve the overall performance of your facility in a short amount of time that
[24:39.750 --> 24:44.710]  is my job part of my job is improving people's drying and curing method I see
[24:44.710 --> 24:48.230]  a lot of wacky shit so let's talk about the way I do it in a commercial
[24:48.230 --> 24:51.870]  environment we do it the same way we start the same way as the glass jar
[24:51.870 --> 24:55.910]  method and a small cultivation cut the plant take off the big leaves cut the
[24:55.910 --> 24:59.950]  plants down hang them upside down until the stems pop when those stems start to
[24:59.950 --> 25:04.950]  pop I will cut the bigger buds and branches off of the plants and leave
[25:04.950 --> 25:08.630]  that main stock so you got the big stock with the main Christmas tree coming out
[25:08.630 --> 25:12.710]  the menorah cut all the buds off of that now you just got the menorah that part
[25:12.710 --> 25:15.750]  goes in another area that's got to get weighed and accounted for before we can
[25:15.750 --> 25:19.150]  throw it away that's another story I will take those big buds they're
[25:19.150 --> 25:24.590]  probably the length of my arm somewhere between 16 and 30 inches long yes we do
[25:24.590 --> 25:28.310]  grow buds that big in a commercial cultivation facility we fill the room
[25:28.310 --> 25:33.630]  with those buds we chop them until they will fit into a large stir light or
[25:33.630 --> 25:40.430]  rubber made container it's about 30 inches long maybe 36 32 inches long it's
[25:40.430 --> 25:44.110]  about a foot and a half tall and it's got a lid that goes on top of it you all
[25:44.110 --> 25:47.830]  know about the storage containers I'm talking about if you've moved they're
[25:47.830 --> 25:51.590]  used for moving if you ship groceries I see a lot of grocery shipped in these
[25:51.590 --> 25:55.550]  things it's a stir light storage container you can get them at Target you
[25:55.550 --> 25:59.550]  can get them just about anywhere you buy plastic stuff those are great for
[25:59.550 --> 26:03.190]  drying and curing your product if you have a large amount of product I know
[26:03.190 --> 26:07.550]  they are not airtight we're gonna get to that in a moment but I take my plants
[26:07.550 --> 26:12.270]  and I will put the plants inside of those containers I'll mark the date that
[26:12.270 --> 26:16.870]  they went into that container and then I will put them in a dry and cure room now
[26:16.870 --> 26:20.150]  let's talk about my dry and cure room this is why the containers don't need to
[26:20.150 --> 26:25.390]  be airtight I have got a humidifier on a controller that every time it gets
[26:25.390 --> 26:31.070]  below or above 50% humidity that dehumidifier comes on I don't know if I
[26:31.070 --> 26:34.790]  said humidifier or dehumidifier in the first round but my point is I have got
[26:34.790 --> 26:39.710]  both devices I have a humidifier and a dehumidifier in the room both set to 50%
[26:39.710 --> 26:44.790]  now they are fighting all day long it's going to stay 50% stays about somewhere
[26:44.790 --> 26:49.950]  between 45 and 55 maybe 60 to 50% relative humidity in that room
[26:49.950 --> 26:54.390]  constantly with those two devices going it's Colorado it gets hot it gets cold
[26:54.390 --> 26:58.390]  it gets dry it gets wet so the devices do have to adjust to the normal they
[26:58.390 --> 27:02.830]  have to fight the normal atmosphere but for the most part it is 50% relative
[27:02.830 --> 27:06.990]  humidity in my drying and curing room so I've got those stir light bins filled
[27:06.990 --> 27:10.470]  with buds they're mostly airtight they seal up pretty well but then to
[27:10.470 --> 27:15.230]  compensate for the lack of seal in there I make the entire room ideal for those
[27:15.230 --> 27:19.150]  plants to be dried and cured in I also dried those plants in that room with the
[27:19.150 --> 27:23.790]  50% relative humidity and the perfect temperature in there usually about 75
[27:23.910 --> 27:28.310]  degrees depends on like I said outside factors other environmental factors make
[27:28.310 --> 27:31.830]  a huge difference but that's the way we do it in a commercial environment then
[27:31.830 --> 27:36.030]  I've got a person it used to be Mike it used to be Ernie there are a couple
[27:36.030 --> 27:39.270]  other guys that I've taught very well how to dry and cure buds in a commercial
[27:39.270 --> 27:43.470]  environment you got to take all those big bins line them up on the floor pop
[27:43.470 --> 27:46.950]  the lids off of every single one of them go and put your hand in there and see
[27:46.950 --> 27:50.710]  the moisture level of those buds I like to turn them over I don't let them sit
[27:50.710 --> 27:54.190]  the bottom buds on the bottom the entire time flip on those bottom buds
[27:54.190 --> 27:59.310]  need some fresh air to so they could dry properly flip them over so I will open
[27:59.310 --> 28:02.750]  them all up we'll leave them open for a determined amount of time like I said
[28:02.750 --> 28:05.870]  before if they're brand new they'll stay open for maybe an hour on a commercial
[28:05.870 --> 28:10.150]  girl in that 50% room then we'll seal them back up maybe it'll just be 15
[28:10.150 --> 28:13.750]  minutes maybe we pop them open to go ooh these are ready when we go ooh these are
[28:13.750 --> 28:17.350]  ready that's when they get trimmed they don't even get trimmed all the way until
[28:17.350 --> 28:21.110]  they're done being dried and cured we can keep them in stasis in that room and
[28:21.110 --> 28:24.670]  they get perfect for the trim crew and when we need them we just go get them we
[28:24.670 --> 28:28.510]  can catch up that way it's not a struggle to be trimming everything all
[28:28.510 --> 28:33.190]  at once we take down 50 to 100 lights worth of plants all at once you don't
[28:33.190 --> 28:36.850]  want to have to scramble to trim that all today you can get it bucked down you
[28:36.850 --> 28:40.790]  can get it in those containers get it in the dry and cure bins get it in a stasis
[28:40.790 --> 28:44.750]  situation and then when you need it go ahead and trim it get it bagged up send
[28:44.750 --> 28:48.350]  it out to the stores that's the way we do it in a big dry use the big plastic
[28:48.350 --> 28:55.110]  bins in a room that is dialed in all right so I hope I did not ruin your
[28:55.110 --> 28:58.230]  hopes and dreams by saying that your cure method does need improvement I
[28:58.230 --> 29:01.670]  think as long as you're drying and curing and paper bags you're going to
[29:01.670 --> 29:06.870]  have a chlorophyll and brown paper bag taste glass jars are not expensive
[29:06.870 --> 29:12.050]  ironically there are not any glass jars available anywhere right now we are in a
[29:12.050 --> 29:16.530]  pandemic situation and I think everybody decided to can their product
[29:16.530 --> 29:19.770]  or they all harvested early because glass jars are hard to find right now
[29:19.770 --> 29:24.130]  good luck with that but that's what I recommend glass jars if you cannot find
[29:24.130 --> 29:28.930]  glass I recommend plastic is my second recommendation go for the medical grade
[29:28.930 --> 29:33.370]  plastic if you can the quality food grade plastics if not do what you've got
[29:33.370 --> 29:36.970]  to do but get away from that brown paper bag I don't think you're ever going to
[29:36.970 --> 29:40.770]  be satisfied you're like crippling yourself you're running you're running
[29:40.770 --> 29:43.330]  you're about to win the race and then right at the end of the race you're like
[29:43.330 --> 29:46.930]  fuck it I'm gonna sit down and just eat a sandwich you could have won but
[29:46.930 --> 29:50.610]  instead you put your shit in a brown paper bag don't do that anymore let's
[29:50.610 --> 29:53.610]  upgrade your garden let's upgrade your game let's start drying and curing and
[29:53.610 --> 29:58.290]  glass if you can plastic is your next bet I've also seen people do it in
[29:58.290 --> 30:02.650]  stainless steel containers that would work for me sounds expensive to buy a
[30:02.650 --> 30:07.130]  bunch of stainless steel containers however if that works you do that all
[30:07.130 --> 30:09.810]  right Jake I want to thank you for the great message I also want to thank you
