[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  Hey, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.160 --> 00:05.640]  It is time for episode 391 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.640 --> 00:08.620]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:08.620 --> 00:12.880]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:12.880 --> 00:18.560]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:18.560 --> 00:22.440]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing
[00:22.440 --> 00:23.440]  on.
[00:23.440 --> 00:27.480]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.120]  You guys know that I love the Stardog.
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.000]  I love the aroma, I love the flavor, and I love the head buzz that it gives me.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.960]  If you've been following along with the podcast, you know that I've been doing a long series
[00:37.960 --> 00:39.400]  of grow lessons.
[00:39.400 --> 00:44.120]  At this point in the grow lessons, it is time to dry and cure our freshly harvested cannabis
[00:44.120 --> 00:45.120]  crop.
[00:45.120 --> 00:51.720]  For this lesson, I'm going to repost episode number 326, my original dry and cure episode.
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's time travel back to episode 326, and let's recap drying and
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.640]  curing our freshly harvested cannabis.
[00:59.640 --> 01:02.760]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:02.760 --> 01:06.640]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:06.640 --> 01:08.640]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.760]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.000]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.160]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:21.160 --> 01:23.440]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.560]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.520]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[01:42.480 --> 01:51.960]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:51.960 --> 01:53.160]  Welcome to the show, internet world.
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.480]  It is time for episode 326 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:56.480 --> 01:58.000]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.800]  I have got a very detailed episode planned out for you.
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.360]  This is going to be the long-awaited, long-anticipated dry and cure episode.
[02:06.360 --> 02:08.500]  We have done an episode on determining ripeness.
[02:08.500 --> 02:11.240]  We did an episode on harvesting your plants.
[02:11.240 --> 02:14.360]  Now it is time to dry and cure our cannabis plants.
[02:14.360 --> 02:17.640]  Before we get there, let's cover a little bit of business.
[02:17.640 --> 02:20.800]  This episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella
[02:20.800 --> 02:22.000]  Dank Seed Company.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.960]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[02:25.960 --> 02:26.960]  Dank Seed Company.
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.240]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:30.240 --> 02:34.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, please support my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.920]  Also, this podcast is brought to you by our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.520]  You should know what's going on in your grow room at all times, and you can pay close attention
[02:42.520 --> 02:44.480]  with the PL Grow Minder Unit.
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.280]  Check out my friends at PL Grow Systems at plgrow.systems.
[02:49.280 --> 02:50.840]  One more order of business.
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.120]  A lot of people let me know that the episode with Deb and Granny and Giddyup and Max had
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.760]  an audio issue.
[02:56.760 --> 02:59.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, that audio issue has been corrected.
[02:59.480 --> 03:03.640]  If you were frustrated listening to that show, I encourage you to go back and check out the
[03:03.640 --> 03:06.440]  corrected audio version of that podcast.
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.240]  Thanks for being patient with me, and big thanks to everybody who let me know there
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.720]  was a technical issue.
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.220]  Speaking of technical issues, I am still working with Stitcher to resolve the technical issues
[03:18.220 --> 03:20.240]  that happen randomly.
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.720]  Some episodes will play for some people, some episodes randomly will not play for people.
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.440]  The only people experiencing the technical issues are people who are listening to the
[03:29.440 --> 03:33.960]  podcast through the Stitcher application on an Android device.
[03:33.960 --> 03:35.800]  Sometimes it works for you, sometimes it doesn't.
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.280]  I'm not sure what's causing it.
[03:37.280 --> 03:41.240]  We thought we had it narrowed down, we corrected a couple of things, it has done it again.
[03:41.240 --> 03:44.440]  I will keep working at getting that resolved.
[03:44.440 --> 03:48.120]  If you can't listen to the episodes through Stitcher, through the application, you can
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.780]  always go to the Stitcher website.
[03:49.780 --> 03:51.020]  You can find the show there.
[03:51.020 --> 03:52.900]  Also, you can find the show on YouTube.
[03:52.900 --> 03:56.020]  I'm trying to keep all the episodes updated on YouTube.
[03:56.020 --> 03:58.380]  I apologize if Stitcher is fighting you.
[03:58.380 --> 03:59.820]  I am working on it.
[03:59.820 --> 04:03.260]  The tech team and the customer support team at Stitcher are helping me, and we cannot
[04:03.260 --> 04:05.460]  find the problem.
[04:05.460 --> 04:09.540]  I feel like I've gotten most of the technical business out of the way.
[04:09.540 --> 04:11.380]  Let's get into a podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:11.380 --> 04:15.660]  You know I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[04:15.660 --> 04:19.180]  Today I've got the honor of dabbing some sauce made by a friend.
[04:19.180 --> 04:21.460]  This was locally grown and locally extracted.
[04:21.460 --> 04:24.500]  My buddy doesn't want to be mentioned on the show, so I'm not going to say his name.
[04:24.500 --> 04:25.900]  Dude, thanks for the great work.
[04:25.900 --> 04:27.140]  My friend grew some cream.
[04:27.140 --> 04:28.540]  Of course, I bred the cream.
[04:28.540 --> 04:30.580]  The cream is cookies and cream to a rise.
[04:30.580 --> 04:32.300]  I passed along some seeds.
[04:32.300 --> 04:33.300]  He grew it.
[04:33.300 --> 04:34.300]  He harvested it.
[04:34.300 --> 04:36.300]  He extracted it and made sauce out of it.
[04:36.300 --> 04:39.420]  Then he was kind enough to bring me a couple of sample jars.
[04:39.420 --> 04:42.220]  You guys, this stuff is tremendous.
[04:42.220 --> 04:43.980]  It's almost gone because it is so delicious.
[04:43.980 --> 04:47.460]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated crystals.
[04:47.500 --> 04:50.620]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated turps.
[04:50.620 --> 04:53.500]  He also brought me a sample of the two combined.
[04:53.500 --> 04:57.180]  I've got the turps, I've got the crystals, and then I've got the saucy mixture put together
[04:57.180 --> 04:59.140]  at a beautiful ratio.
[04:59.140 --> 05:04.900]  You guys, the mixture smells like cupcake frosting and cookie dough.
[05:04.900 --> 05:09.460]  Then when you take a dab of it, it tastes like you just took a big bite of cookie dough
[05:09.460 --> 05:11.140]  with cupcake frosting on it.
[05:11.140 --> 05:14.900]  Then when you blow it out, it smells like somebody's baking fresh cookies in the room.
[05:14.900 --> 05:19.580]  It smells like warm chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies filling the room.
[05:19.580 --> 05:21.460]  This concentrate is excellent.
[05:21.460 --> 05:22.940]  It is super smooth.
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.660]  I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[05:24.660 --> 05:25.660]  There was no throat tingle.
[05:25.660 --> 05:27.940]  There was no heaviness on the exhale.
[05:27.940 --> 05:30.820]  Super smooth, super clean, super delicious concentrates.
[05:30.820 --> 05:35.300]  Dude, I know you don't want me to say your name on the air, but great product, great
[05:35.300 --> 05:36.300]  work.
[05:36.300 --> 05:37.380]  You did a hell of a job with this.
[05:37.380 --> 05:38.380]  This stuff tastes amazing.
[05:38.380 --> 05:40.540]  The only problem is that it is almost gone.
[05:40.540 --> 05:44.460]  I've probably got one or two dabs before this stuff is extinct.
[05:44.460 --> 05:48.780]  So bro, come back with a bigger jar and let's make a deal.
[05:48.780 --> 05:53.420]  All right, you guys, I'm obviously loving these cream dabs grown and extracted by a
[05:53.420 --> 05:54.420]  local farmer.
[05:54.420 --> 05:55.420]  Hey bro, great work.
[05:55.420 --> 05:56.980]  I truly do appreciate it.
[05:56.980 --> 05:59.500]  In fact, this episode is going to be really long.
[05:59.500 --> 06:01.700]  So I've got all of the opening business covered.
[06:01.700 --> 06:02.700]  I'm going to press pause.
[06:02.700 --> 06:05.740]  I'm going to take a dab, probably the last two dabs of this cream.
[06:05.740 --> 06:11.140]  And when I get back, I will give a long lesson on drying and curing your freshly harvested
[06:11.140 --> 06:12.140]  cannabis plants.
[06:12.140 --> 06:14.340]  All right, podcast world.
[06:14.420 --> 06:15.420]  I am back.
[06:15.420 --> 06:16.420]  I am well medicated.
[06:16.420 --> 06:21.060]  I am well hydrated and I am ready to talk about drying and curing your freshly harvested
[06:21.060 --> 06:22.060]  cannabis plants.
[06:22.060 --> 06:25.180]  Now let me do a quick update from the last episode.
[06:25.180 --> 06:28.340]  In the last episode, we talked about harvesting your plants.
[06:28.340 --> 06:29.580]  We talked about cutting them down.
[06:29.580 --> 06:33.500]  We talked about hanging them in a room upside down in a climate controlled room.
[06:33.500 --> 06:38.340]  One thing I failed to mention, you should only hang one crop in a space at a time to
[06:38.340 --> 06:42.700]  prevent re-moisturizing the first crop.
[06:42.700 --> 06:47.500]  So cut down one crop and then let it hang for four or five days, five or seven days,
[06:47.500 --> 06:50.580]  and then bring in a fresh crop and lock that in the same room.
[06:50.580 --> 06:54.420]  Because what you're doing is just introducing a whole bunch of moisture into that room and
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.220]  it's just going to go into the other plants.
[06:56.220 --> 06:59.460]  You're going to re-moisten the other plants and make them take longer.
[06:59.460 --> 07:02.580]  And now you've got to kind of restart your dry and cure process.
[07:02.580 --> 07:06.980]  So one crop at a time is ideal hanging in the room.
[07:06.980 --> 07:09.660]  That's something I should have mentioned on the episode before.
[07:09.660 --> 07:11.100]  And I didn't remember to mention that.
[07:11.100 --> 07:13.220]  So now we are up to speed.
[07:13.220 --> 07:18.700]  Now let's actually get into drying and curing our freshly harvested cannabis plants.
[07:18.700 --> 07:24.980]  Now after spending four weeks in veg, eight to 10 weeks in flour, you really don't want
[07:24.980 --> 07:27.800]  to mess these plants up at the very end here.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.700]  Curing is a very critical process.
[07:29.700 --> 07:35.540]  Curing, you can make the most delicious buds taste like total shit from drying and curing
[07:35.540 --> 07:37.060]  them improperly.
[07:37.060 --> 07:39.120]  You can ruin the entire crop at this point.
[07:39.120 --> 07:42.160]  Don't get too scared because I'm going to guide you through not ruining it.
[07:42.160 --> 07:46.980]  But keep in mind that this is one of the most critical parts in the growing process.
[07:46.980 --> 07:51.360]  This is a huge process and a lot of things can go wrong if you don't pay attention.
[07:51.360 --> 07:57.360]  So take your time and pay attention and don't rush to smoke your new crop.
[07:57.360 --> 08:02.760]  You've waited, what do we say, about 14 weeks probably is what we did the math on, 120 days.
[08:02.760 --> 08:06.500]  You've grown these plants for 120 days is about how long it takes.
[08:06.500 --> 08:10.780]  Why not wait a couple of days longer until they are perfect before you start smoking
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.780]  it?
[08:11.780 --> 08:14.820]  So let's get into actually drying and curing these plants.
[08:14.820 --> 08:18.700]  Now the last grow episode was a harvest episode and it left us with our plants hanging upside
[08:18.700 --> 08:23.000]  down in a room with proper temps, proper humidity, and minimal light.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.460]  Now we've been waiting for the sticks for our plants to snap.
[08:26.460 --> 08:30.140]  We've got plants hanging upside down, they've been de-leafed, we're just waiting for the
[08:30.140 --> 08:33.940]  right humidity within the plants for the sticks to pop.
[08:33.940 --> 08:37.340]  The sticks should snap, we're waiting for them to snap but not explode.
[08:37.340 --> 08:42.300]  When you grab a branch of the plant and you just bend it, you want it to sound kind of
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.300]  like that.
[08:43.300 --> 08:46.500]  You don't want it to go kshhh, you don't want it to explode with dryness, you don't want
[08:46.500 --> 08:51.180]  it to fall apart, and you don't want it to be gummy or rubbery or bendy.
[08:51.180 --> 08:54.540]  You don't want it to bend, you want it to snap and pop.
[08:54.540 --> 08:56.540]  So the sticks should snap.
[08:56.540 --> 09:00.540]  The bigger sticks and larger plants are going to take a little bit longer.
[09:00.540 --> 09:04.060]  The skinnier sticks and smaller plants are obviously going to dry more quickly because
[09:04.060 --> 09:06.100]  they don't hold as much moisture.
[09:06.100 --> 09:10.980]  Also if you took off less leaf or more leaf, they're going to dry more quickly without
[09:10.980 --> 09:14.540]  the leaf and they're going to take a little longer with that extra leaf on there because
[09:14.540 --> 09:18.940]  it's going to hold more moisture, there'll be more moisture in the room, just more moisture
[09:18.940 --> 09:20.120]  overall to deal with.
[09:20.120 --> 09:23.740]  So what we're waiting for is those sticks to snap.
[09:23.740 --> 09:28.100]  When the sticks snap, that's when the container curing process begins.
[09:28.100 --> 09:31.540]  I use two different methods for this based on crop size.
[09:31.540 --> 09:33.860]  Don't forget that I run commercial grows.
[09:33.860 --> 09:37.420]  In a commercial setting, we do things a little differently than we would do in a home setting.
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.900]  I'm used to pulling down 50 or more pounds.
[09:39.900 --> 09:42.860]  In a commercial environment, you don't want a bunch of jars.
[09:42.860 --> 09:44.620]  You don't really have the space for a bunch of jars.
[09:44.620 --> 09:47.300]  You don't have the manpower to open a bunch of jars all day.
[09:47.300 --> 09:48.800]  So we do things a little differently.
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.260]  In a home grow, it's not as many pounds, it's less jars, so I use jar technique in a home
[09:54.260 --> 09:55.260]  grow.
[09:55.420 --> 09:58.860]  Let's talk about the way I would do it in a commercial grow.
[09:58.860 --> 10:03.200]  In a commercial grow, I'll chop the large stalk and naked stems out of the plants and
[10:03.200 --> 10:07.900]  place the buds still on sticks into large Rubbermaid containers.
[10:07.900 --> 10:12.420]  So you've got a big plant, you've lollipopped up probably 12 to 18 inches of it, so you've
[10:12.420 --> 10:13.700]  got some naked sticks, right?
[10:13.700 --> 10:17.940]  That's what I mean by naked sticks, the shaved legs and that main big stalk.
[10:17.940 --> 10:20.380]  I'll cut all of that out and that goes to waste.
[10:20.380 --> 10:26.020]  In a commercial grow, that's actually got to be weighed and documented as removed waste.
[10:26.020 --> 10:27.180]  So now I've got two piles.
[10:27.180 --> 10:30.380]  One pile is naked sticks that need to be documented as waste.
[10:30.380 --> 10:32.420]  They'll be chipped up and thrown away.
[10:32.420 --> 10:33.420]  Then there's another pile.
[10:33.420 --> 10:37.260]  That's the usable product, the sticks with buds up it that need to be trimmed.
[10:37.260 --> 10:42.900]  Those buds still on the sticks get put into the Rubbermaid containers untrimmed.
[10:42.900 --> 10:44.580]  Now here's something to keep in mind.
[10:44.580 --> 10:46.860]  Carefully label your Rubbermaid containers.
[10:46.860 --> 10:48.380]  Do not label the lids.
[10:48.380 --> 10:52.100]  Never label lids in a facility, in a home grow.
[10:52.100 --> 10:53.220]  Don't label the lids.
[10:53.220 --> 10:54.580]  Lids are interchangeable.
[10:54.580 --> 10:55.980]  Label the container.
[10:55.980 --> 11:00.820]  So chop the sticks out, put the good usable buds into the Rubbermaid container.
[11:00.820 --> 11:02.100]  Don't squish them in there too tight.
[11:02.100 --> 11:04.660]  Fill it up pretty well, but don't cram anything in there.
[11:04.660 --> 11:07.020]  You need some airspace in there and you don't want to smash anything.
[11:07.020 --> 11:09.980]  And if it's too tightly pressed together, it'll get funky.
[11:09.980 --> 11:11.780]  It'll start to smell bad.
[11:11.780 --> 11:15.100]  Moisture will get trapped in there and you'll start to get that stale ammonia smell and
[11:15.100 --> 11:18.420]  that's what we're trying to avoid with proper drying and curing.
[11:18.420 --> 11:22.900]  So I would go through and remove all of the sticks, get all the good buds into the containers,
[11:22.900 --> 11:26.620]  and then once they are all completed, I would go through and put the lids on every container
[11:26.620 --> 11:27.620]  at that point.
[11:27.620 --> 11:28.620]  I would have everything labeled.
[11:28.620 --> 11:30.340]  It'd all be sitting open.
[11:30.340 --> 11:34.140]  And then when we're done with every plant that's going to get binned that day, that's
[11:34.140 --> 11:36.700]  when I start putting the lids on and sealing up the containers.
[11:36.700 --> 11:40.020]  Now I feel like I haven't described these containers properly.
[11:40.020 --> 11:45.060]  These Rubbermaid containers are like the size of maybe a laundry basket.
[11:45.060 --> 11:51.940]  They're about three feet wide, I guess, and then maybe a foot or so wide.
[11:51.940 --> 11:56.060]  I know I said wide, but three feet long and a foot or so wide, and then probably about
[11:56.060 --> 11:58.260]  18, maybe 20 inches deep.
[11:58.260 --> 12:02.340]  They're the one that you use for packing or you just put a bunch of clothes in there,
[12:02.340 --> 12:05.460]  just a bunch of bullshit, or it's the one when the kids come to the front door and they're
[12:05.460 --> 12:06.820]  trying to sell candy for church.
[12:06.820 --> 12:07.940]  Like I got some candy for church.
[12:07.940 --> 12:09.260]  Would you like to raise some money?
[12:09.260 --> 12:11.220]  And they got the big Rubbermaid container.
[12:11.220 --> 12:13.220]  That's the container I'm talking about.
[12:13.580 --> 12:16.780]  Just like a moving box or something is what it looks like, a storage container.
[12:16.780 --> 12:21.940]  We can fit three or four large plants in those containers from the commercial grow.
[12:21.940 --> 12:24.660]  So I guess I should have mentioned that a little earlier, but it just dawned on me that
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.460]  I did not describe these containers in any way.
[12:27.460 --> 12:31.860]  So now let's talk more about what happens to these plants once they are put into this
[12:31.860 --> 12:34.740]  container and the lid is put on them.
[12:34.740 --> 12:39.360]  They need to be opened and rotated every day until they're dry enough to seal up without
[12:39.360 --> 12:40.940]  risking any mold development.
[12:40.940 --> 12:42.340]  The first day is always scary.
[12:42.460 --> 12:46.660]  When you seal them up and then leave overnight, that is always a scary feeling until you get
[12:46.660 --> 12:48.620]  there the next day.
[12:48.620 --> 12:52.020]  Don't be afraid to leave them open if you feel like they're a little too moist.
[12:52.020 --> 12:55.420]  If you cut them down and get them in the bin and realize, ah shit, a couple of these are
[12:55.420 --> 12:56.560]  too wet.
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.200]  Don't be afraid to leave those open overnight.
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.900]  You would rather leave them open and get them a little too dry than close them up and get
[13:02.900 --> 13:04.060]  them a little funky.
[13:04.060 --> 13:05.820]  A little funky doesn't go away.
[13:05.820 --> 13:08.220]  A little too dry we can work with.
[13:08.220 --> 13:11.780]  So you seal them up, you put the lids on them, and then you might want to check on them before
[13:11.780 --> 13:12.880]  you leave for the day.
[13:12.880 --> 13:15.820]  Make sure that nothing needs to be rotated, nothing needs to be flipped around, nothing
[13:15.820 --> 13:17.540]  needs to be left open.
[13:17.540 --> 13:19.940]  Like I said, if it needs to be left open, leave it open.
[13:19.940 --> 13:20.940]  Don't be afraid.
[13:20.940 --> 13:22.340]  Then, you're going to leave.
[13:22.340 --> 13:23.840]  You're going to come back the next day.
[13:23.840 --> 13:25.400]  You're going to have a bunch of sealed containers.
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.860]  They need to be popped open immediately.
[13:27.860 --> 13:33.300]  I would pop them open for four, maybe six, maybe seven hours and check on them.
[13:33.300 --> 13:37.940]  While they were sealed, a lot of the moisture that was inside those sticks reconstituted
[13:37.940 --> 13:38.940]  throughout those buds.
[13:39.300 --> 13:41.300]  A lot of moisture built up in that container.
[13:41.300 --> 13:44.620]  You're going to find a lot of spongy and wet buds when you come in in the morning.
[13:44.620 --> 13:45.980]  That's expected.
[13:45.980 --> 13:46.980]  Don't worry.
[13:46.980 --> 13:47.980]  It'll be okay.
[13:47.980 --> 13:49.780]  You're going to leave it open and get some of that shit out of there.
[13:49.780 --> 13:51.140]  That's the idea.
[13:51.140 --> 13:54.200]  You want to open it up every day and let that stuff out of there.
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.660]  When they start getting dry again, some of the sticks might not even snap again.
[13:57.660 --> 14:00.820]  Some of them may have re-moistened to where they don't snap.
[14:00.820 --> 14:04.140]  That means you may have gone just a little bit too early, but it's not bad because we
[14:04.140 --> 14:05.660]  can get that moisture out.
[14:05.660 --> 14:07.180]  You don't want it to get too dry.
[14:07.580 --> 14:08.580]  You're going to pop them open.
[14:08.580 --> 14:10.180]  You're going to see how wet they are.
[14:10.180 --> 14:11.180]  Leave them open.
[14:11.180 --> 14:12.700]  You may just want to leave them open for an hour.
[14:12.700 --> 14:14.940]  If they're real dry, an hour is fine.
[14:14.940 --> 14:18.640]  Four to six hours is not uncommon on the first day.
[14:18.640 --> 14:23.220]  If you chop those plants down or if you bend those plants a little bit too early, they
[14:23.220 --> 14:24.460]  may be really wet.
[14:24.460 --> 14:27.980]  You may have to leave them open for four to six, maybe the whole shift of eight to 10
[14:27.980 --> 14:28.980]  hours.
[14:28.980 --> 14:29.980]  They may have to stay open.
[14:29.980 --> 14:30.980]  That's not uncommon.
[14:30.980 --> 14:34.820]  Try not to cut them down and put them into the bends so early next time, but you'll be
[14:34.820 --> 14:35.820]  okay.
[14:35.820 --> 14:39.580]  You're going to have to dial in with your facility and with your technique.
[14:39.580 --> 14:44.500]  The duration of burp time is going to decrease slowly as the buds dry.
[14:44.500 --> 14:51.740]  These bends are going to sit in a room ideally that is at 50% humidity and 70 degrees until
[14:51.740 --> 14:53.380]  you have time to trim them.
[14:53.380 --> 14:59.460]  I run a humidifier and a dehumidifier at the same time, and they're both set at 50% humidity.
[14:59.460 --> 15:04.180]  If that room gets to 55% humidity, that dehumidifier kicks on immediately.
[15:04.180 --> 15:08.460]  If it gets to 45%, the humidifier comes on immediately.
[15:08.460 --> 15:12.460]  I don't get out of that 10 degree range, and it stays pretty close with both of those machines
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.700]  and they're fighting each other.
[15:13.700 --> 15:16.260]  They pretty much just stay on all the time.
[15:16.260 --> 15:17.980]  I've got these buds.
[15:17.980 --> 15:18.980]  They are in containers.
[15:18.980 --> 15:23.620]  They have not been trimmed yet, and they still need to be burped on a daily basis.
[15:23.620 --> 15:27.600]  The first thing the dry and cure manager or the trim team manager should do when they
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.940]  get to the grow is pop open these bends and see what type of situation you've got.
[15:32.940 --> 15:36.700]  They should be getting drier and more smokeable, and they should start smelling more like dank
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.340]  cannabis every day.
[15:38.340 --> 15:43.260]  That fresh green wet smell should be going away, but you're going to have to pop them
[15:43.260 --> 15:47.080]  every day and pay attention to how long they need to be opened.
[15:47.080 --> 15:50.660]  Like I said, that first day, you're going to get four to six hours.
[15:50.660 --> 15:52.760]  Maybe the second day, four to six hours.
[15:52.760 --> 15:54.440]  Maybe the third day, four hours.
[15:54.440 --> 15:56.420]  Maybe the fourth day, three hours.
[15:56.420 --> 15:59.380]  Then maybe you're just going to have to pop them open for an hour every day and see what's
[15:59.380 --> 16:01.300]  going on and check it out.
[16:01.740 --> 16:04.180]  You won't have to open them anymore.
[16:04.180 --> 16:09.100]  Once you've gotten them to about 65% humidity inside the container consistently, you don't
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.140]  have to burp it.
[16:10.140 --> 16:12.180]  That is cured where you want it.
[16:12.180 --> 16:17.140]  It's also in that room with 50% humidity, so it's going to stay about 50% humidity,
[16:17.140 --> 16:19.340]  and it won't get less than that.
[16:19.340 --> 16:24.180]  The containers hold moisture in there, so it's going to stay above 50%, trust me.
[16:24.180 --> 16:28.380]  While you're drying and curing inside those bends, be sure to burp the bends every day
[16:28.500 --> 16:33.180]  and rotate the buds to prevent mold and funky aromas until they get dry enough to leave
[16:33.180 --> 16:34.180]  alone.
[16:34.180 --> 16:37.940]  Don't be afraid to take the buds and pick them up right outside of the container and
[16:37.940 --> 16:41.660]  flip them over and set them back in so all the buds that were on the bottom are now on
[16:41.660 --> 16:42.660]  the top.
[16:42.660 --> 16:48.020]  You can do that once or twice a day if you feel like you need to if they are really wet.
[16:48.020 --> 16:51.580]  Something I want to keep stressing is if they are too moist, don't be afraid to leave the
[16:51.580 --> 16:56.500]  lid off the containers until the buds are nice and dry and you feel comfortable closing
[16:56.500 --> 16:59.660]  them up and you're sure there's not going to get any mold in there.
[16:59.660 --> 17:04.220]  Because if you leave it closed for too long or you bend these buds too early, you're going
[17:04.220 --> 17:09.340]  to create an ammonia-type, funky, terrible smell inside your buds.
[17:09.340 --> 17:12.980]  They're not going to burn well, they're going to taste terrible, they're going to smell
[17:12.980 --> 17:16.500]  funky, and it's not going to be desirable, and you're not going to be able to sell it
[17:16.500 --> 17:19.700]  at your dispensary or however you plan on selling it.
[17:19.700 --> 17:23.940]  One problem you may run into if you leave it closed too long is funky aromas.
[17:23.940 --> 17:27.020]  The only thing you can do to fix that is try to air it out.
[17:27.020 --> 17:31.260]  Just leave it open, let it dry, try to let that smell go away, and it's probably not
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.260]  going to.
[17:32.260 --> 17:33.460]  You've probably gone too long.
[17:33.460 --> 17:37.980]  So make sure not to seal it up for too long and make sure not to seal it up when it's
[17:37.980 --> 17:39.580]  too moist.
[17:39.580 --> 17:42.740]  Another problem you could run into during the drying and curing process is the buds
[17:42.740 --> 17:44.840]  could get too dry.
[17:44.840 --> 17:50.140]  If your buds get too dry in those containers, a trick you can do is to go pull a few leaves
[17:50.140 --> 17:53.020]  from your growing plants.
[17:53.100 --> 17:57.340]  If you've got a flower room, you probably need to defoliate a little bit and pull some
[17:57.340 --> 17:59.420]  leaves off those flowering plants anyway.
[17:59.420 --> 18:05.180]  So go get, I would say, four to six large leaves per Rubbermaid container is more than
[18:05.180 --> 18:09.940]  enough to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one of those containers.
[18:09.940 --> 18:13.580]  We tried to put too much in there and it made it really wet really quickly.
[18:13.580 --> 18:19.080]  So four to six leaves is more than enough to re-moisten an entire Rubbermaid container
[18:19.080 --> 18:21.820]  if you left it open just a little bit too long.
[18:21.820 --> 18:25.420]  If you got it down into that Colorado crunch zone, then you've done fucked up and you might
[18:25.420 --> 18:26.420]  not be able to fix it.
[18:26.420 --> 18:29.260]  But we'll talk about that a little bit later in the episode.
[18:29.260 --> 18:33.740]  But if you didn't go too far, just grab four or five, maybe six leaves, throw them in the
[18:33.740 --> 18:37.740]  container and seal it up for just a few hours, then go check on it.
[18:37.740 --> 18:41.580]  That moisture will reconstitute the buds and give you a second chance.
[18:41.580 --> 18:46.300]  I would not recommend using anything other than cannabis leaves, maybe Boveda packs,
[18:46.300 --> 18:48.300]  Boveda packs, however you like to say it.
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.220]  The Boveda packs come in 62% humidity.
[18:52.220 --> 18:55.740]  You can use those if you'd like, although I do not prefer them myself.
[18:55.740 --> 18:59.420]  I think they make a weird flavor in my cannabis buds.
[18:59.420 --> 19:03.060]  I think that using the leaves of the same plant is the best idea.
[19:03.060 --> 19:08.740]  All right, so that is basically the commercial grow version of drying and curing your cannabis
[19:08.740 --> 19:11.780]  plants on a large scale.
[19:11.780 --> 19:15.980]  Now I'm going to take a giant dab and when we get back, we will talk about drying and
[19:15.980 --> 19:18.260]  curing your cannabis on a smaller scale.
[19:19.060 --> 19:46.520]  The home grow or the connoisseur version of drying and curing your final product is a
[19:46.520 --> 19:50.320]  little bit different than the commercial grow version, but it's basically the same idea.
[19:50.320 --> 19:52.520]  We want to slow down the drying process.
[19:52.520 --> 19:54.680]  We want to get those buds to feel nice and sticky.
[19:54.680 --> 19:57.000]  We want them to smell nice and sweet.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.440]  We want them to burn nice and smooth.
[19:59.280 --> 20:05.320]  This is how I would dry and cure my product in a small connoisseur batch.
[20:05.320 --> 20:09.900]  In a smaller grow, a home grow or a boutique grow, or maybe something I was going to enter
[20:09.900 --> 20:16.240]  into a competition, if this was going into a cup, this is how I would cure my product.
[20:16.240 --> 20:20.820]  The main difference is that I would not be using the gigantic Rubbermaid containers.
[20:20.820 --> 20:24.920]  I would use quart size wide mouth glass jars.
[20:24.920 --> 20:26.520]  I don't want to use bigger jars.
[20:26.520 --> 20:29.320]  I feel like maybe too much moisture gets stuck in there.
[20:29.320 --> 20:32.680]  You have the same conditions that you create in those Rubbermaid containers.
[20:32.680 --> 20:35.320]  I like the smaller, more focused jars.
[20:35.320 --> 20:38.880]  Another note before we get too far, make sure you label each jar.
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.120]  If you're working with more than one strain, label the jars, not the lids.
[20:43.120 --> 20:44.480]  Lids are interchangeable.
[20:44.480 --> 20:46.160]  Be careful with this, please.
[20:46.160 --> 20:52.080]  If you're working with different phenotypes, label the jar whatever arise phenotype two,
[20:52.080 --> 20:53.280]  arise phenotype three.
[20:53.280 --> 20:56.880]  If you're running a pack of seeds or whatever, label the jars so that you know what you're
[20:56.880 --> 20:59.120]  working with.
[20:59.120 --> 21:03.040]  Basically everything up to the point of the sticks snapping is the same.
[21:03.040 --> 21:04.720]  We're waiting for the sticks to snap.
[21:04.720 --> 21:10.180]  Once the sticks snap, that's when we can start the jar curing process.
[21:10.180 --> 21:15.080]  For jar tech, I would take the snappy sticks and chop off every bud into a bucket.
[21:15.080 --> 21:19.240]  Just get all those buds off the sticks into the bucket, throw those sticks away, get rid
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.400]  of them, do whatever you do with them, compost them, shred them up, toss them.
[21:22.520 --> 21:25.000]  Once those are done, then I hand trim the buds.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.600]  I'll do another episode all about hand trimming the buds.
[21:27.600 --> 21:32.000]  I don't like trim machines and I don't like wet trim, but I'll talk about that in the
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.800]  trimming episode that is coming up.
[21:33.800 --> 21:34.880]  I trim the buds.
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.040]  They should be dry enough by now to knock off most of the leaves with your thumbs and
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.160]  thumb nails.
[21:40.160 --> 21:45.120]  Trim them up pretty closely with your thumb, then put the trimmed buds into the glass jars
[21:45.120 --> 21:49.080]  that we talked about, the wide mouth quart size mason jars.
[21:49.080 --> 21:53.040]  Fill those jars about 75 to 90% full.
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.200]  If your buds are fluffier, if your buds are bigger, you're only going to be able to get
[21:58.200 --> 22:00.680]  75% in there because of all the air space.
[22:00.680 --> 22:01.680]  I get it.
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.680]  It makes sense.
[22:02.680 --> 22:07.120]  If you've got smaller buds, you can put up to 90% in there, but do not press them down
[22:07.120 --> 22:10.580]  into the jar and don't over pack them and don't squish them in.
[22:10.580 --> 22:13.680]  You just want them lightly sitting in there.
[22:13.680 --> 22:16.800]  Once the jar is full, I add the lid and I set a timer.
[22:16.800 --> 22:22.800]  I like to check my buds about four hours after being sealed up for the first time.
[22:22.800 --> 22:25.920]  This first check lets me see how much moisture is trapped in my buds.
[22:25.920 --> 22:31.040]  If the inside of the jar is extremely humid, I'll just leave that lid off for an hour or
[22:31.040 --> 22:32.040]  more.
[22:32.040 --> 22:35.600]  In the commercial grow, we were talking about four to six, maybe eight hours, maybe even
[22:35.600 --> 22:36.640]  10 hours.
[22:36.640 --> 22:41.800]  Those are much larger plants, much larger batches and much larger containers.
[22:41.800 --> 22:43.800]  There is much more moisture in there.
[22:43.800 --> 22:49.160]  For these smaller jars, I only want to leave it off for a little bit at a time.
[22:49.160 --> 22:53.680]  These smaller batches can get away from you quite quickly, so pay more attention.
[22:53.680 --> 22:54.680]  Open it up.
[22:54.680 --> 22:55.680]  See how humid it is.
[22:55.680 --> 22:59.440]  If it's really humid and really squishy, you're going to want to leave it open for an hour,
[22:59.440 --> 23:00.620]  maybe a little bit more.
[23:00.620 --> 23:02.920]  Just keep checking on it and do not forget about it.
[23:02.920 --> 23:03.920]  Set another timer.
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.360]  If the humidity has not made the buds squishy again, I'll leave the jar open for only 15
[23:09.360 --> 23:14.120]  to 30 minutes to let the moisture out and that old funky air out of the jar.
[23:14.120 --> 23:16.560]  Then it'll refresh with fresh air in there.
[23:16.560 --> 23:20.560]  Then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit for another four to six hours.
[23:20.560 --> 23:22.360]  I set a timer for this.
[23:22.360 --> 23:27.080]  Then in four to six hours, I pop that jar and I gently stir the buds around and check
[23:27.080 --> 23:29.800]  the aroma that comes out of there.
[23:29.800 --> 23:37.000]  What I'm looking for when I smell is an aroma of ammonia or funk.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  You'll notice it.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.960]  Your nose will crinkle up and your eyes will make a weird squint and you'll go, fuck, I
[23:40.960 --> 23:41.960]  fucked up.
[23:41.960 --> 23:43.440]  I'm looking for that aroma.
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.040]  I'm hoping that's not present.
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.040]  It shouldn't be.
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.600]  Also, I'm looking to see if it smells less wet.
[23:49.600 --> 23:55.280]  Has it gone from that wet, juicy hay smell to more of that cured chronic smell that I'm
[23:55.280 --> 23:56.280]  looking for?
[23:56.280 --> 23:59.560]  Because it'll start doing it quickly and then it will improve over time.
[23:59.560 --> 24:00.960]  So I'm cracking the jar open.
[24:00.960 --> 24:04.280]  I'm looking to see how much humidity is in there.
[24:04.280 --> 24:05.760]  I stir them around.
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.120]  If the buds seem damp or extra spongy at this point, I'll dump them out of the jar and let
[24:11.120 --> 24:14.800]  them sit for a few minutes until that excess moisture evaporates.
[24:14.800 --> 24:18.000]  You don't want the buds super soggy and sealed in a jar.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.680]  You don't want the buds super wet and pressed together in a jar.
[24:20.680 --> 24:25.480]  If they still feel wet and spongy on the outside, I'll dump them out and let them sit out for
[24:25.480 --> 24:30.320]  a few minutes until they feel dry on the outside, but when you squeeze them, they're mushy still
[24:30.320 --> 24:31.520]  a little bit.
[24:31.520 --> 24:34.520]  You just want them dry on the outside, wet on the inside is what you're going for at
[24:34.520 --> 24:35.640]  this point.
[24:35.680 --> 24:39.800]  If the buds are sticking together, then I dump them out completely and let them dry
[24:39.800 --> 24:41.920]  more before putting them back in.
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.040]  Now we want a little bit of moisture in these buds.
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.200]  The little bit of moisture is going to make the drying and curing process happen, but
[24:49.200 --> 24:52.880]  we don't want enough moisture to cause mold and funk.
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.160]  So we burp the jar about every four hours to make sure we don't seal too much water
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.160]  in the jar for too long.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.300]  We let some of the curing process happen by opening the jar, letting that old gas out
[25:03.300 --> 25:07.180]  that contains the chlorophyll, that contains the sugars, that gas evaporates out of the
[25:07.180 --> 25:10.260]  jar, we replace it with fresh air, we seal it back up.
[25:10.260 --> 25:13.060]  Then when we seal it, it's allowed to restart the curing process.
[25:13.060 --> 25:18.140]  It'll start deteriorating and eating up more of that chlorophyll, more of those excess
[25:18.140 --> 25:22.220]  minerals and sugars inside of there, and they will start evaporating out of your buds.
[25:22.220 --> 25:23.220]  You'll get them out.
[25:23.220 --> 25:25.660]  So let's get back on track here.
[25:25.660 --> 25:30.380]  After the first couple of days, you can slowly increase your burp intervals as the buds get
[25:30.380 --> 25:31.380]  drier.
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.620]  You may only need to open these jars up every six to eight hours after a little bit.
[25:35.620 --> 25:38.740]  And the time that you leave them open will also decrease.
[25:38.740 --> 25:42.060]  So maybe after a few days, you pop it open every eight hours.
[25:42.060 --> 25:43.740]  Maybe you pop it open right before you go to work.
[25:43.740 --> 25:46.140]  You leave it open while you're brushing your teeth and getting your shoes on, and then
[25:46.140 --> 25:47.560]  you close it up and you leave.
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.260]  You come back from work and then you pop it open.
[25:49.260 --> 25:51.060]  It's probably been 10 hours by now.
[25:51.060 --> 25:54.020]  Pop it open again, stir the buds around, make sure nothing's gone funky.
[25:54.020 --> 25:57.260]  If nothing's gone funky, just leave it open for five minutes.
[25:57.260 --> 26:00.220]  Let that air exchange in there, seal it right back up.
[26:00.220 --> 26:03.020]  And you can go 10 hours and you know you're safe at 10 hours.
[26:03.020 --> 26:04.340]  See what happens at 11 hours.
[26:04.340 --> 26:05.620]  See what happens at 12 hours.
[26:05.620 --> 26:07.660]  Just start stretching it every day.
[26:07.660 --> 26:11.900]  By the end of two weeks, you'll just be popping these jars open once a day.
[26:11.900 --> 26:12.900]  You'll check it out.
[26:12.900 --> 26:14.980]  You'll give it a good smell and you'll say, that is so close.
[26:14.980 --> 26:16.580]  And then you can close it back up.
[26:16.580 --> 26:22.060]  By the end of two weeks, these buds will be beautifully, beautifully cured.
[26:22.060 --> 26:28.100]  So the buds should be sticky on the outside and spongy, but not dry and crumbly.
[26:28.100 --> 26:31.220]  They should almost have a little bit of squeeze, a little bit of give to them and then stick
[26:31.220 --> 26:32.220]  to your fingers.
[26:32.220 --> 26:37.580]  They shouldn't fall apart and just crumble up like a lot of the Colorado dispensary bud
[26:37.580 --> 26:38.580]  does unfortunately.
[26:38.580 --> 26:42.540]  And the reason for that you guys is because it's sitting on the shelf out there all day.
[26:42.540 --> 26:45.420]  They're opening up those jars and showing it to you all day.
[26:45.420 --> 26:47.060]  That stuff is just getting dry.
[26:47.060 --> 26:48.860]  So that's the problem with the Colorado crunch.
[26:48.860 --> 26:50.020]  I apologize for that.
[26:50.020 --> 26:53.820]  The growers work hard to get it proper and then it's sent to the dispensary and left
[26:53.820 --> 26:56.900]  in those jars and the bud tenders don't do us justice.
[26:56.900 --> 26:57.900]  So I apologize.
[26:58.100 --> 27:01.460]  So on day one, I chopped the buds off the sticks and I trim them up.
[27:01.460 --> 27:03.940]  Then I fill the jars about 90% full.
[27:03.940 --> 27:05.220]  Then I seal the jar.
[27:05.220 --> 27:07.500]  I check the jar in about four hours.
[27:07.500 --> 27:11.140]  I open it long enough for the excess moisture to come out of the jar.
[27:11.140 --> 27:12.260]  That could be a little while.
[27:12.260 --> 27:14.380]  That could be a short amount of time.
[27:14.380 --> 27:17.740]  It kind of depends on how wet the buds were when you jarred them up.
[27:17.740 --> 27:19.420]  Then I check it again in about four hours.
[27:19.420 --> 27:22.460]  I shuffled the buds if I feel that's necessary.
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.700]  It's likely necessary.
[27:24.700 --> 27:28.340]  Then I check again in four to six hours and leave open as necessary.
[27:28.340 --> 27:30.980]  If they're getting too sticky again, I'll dump them out.
[27:30.980 --> 27:33.700]  You'll want to check as soon as you wake up the next day.
[27:33.700 --> 27:36.660]  The burp process will slow down over the next few days.
[27:36.660 --> 27:40.940]  You want it to take as long as possible without allowing mildew to develop.
[27:40.940 --> 27:42.060]  You want to slow it down.
[27:42.060 --> 27:43.380]  The longer it takes, the better.
[27:43.380 --> 27:47.580]  The more time that it takes for that moisture to come out, the more opportunity you have
[27:47.580 --> 27:49.860]  for chlorophyll to be removed.
[27:49.860 --> 27:54.620]  The only thing to worry about, very similarly to the Rubbermaid technique, is trapping too
[27:54.620 --> 28:01.420]  much moisture in your containers for too long and causing yourself mildew or funky flavors.
[28:01.420 --> 28:05.340]  If you locked your buds up in these jars long enough to where you got white moldy webbing
[28:05.340 --> 28:09.100]  growing on there and it looks like some cotton coming out, you fucked up and didn't pay any
[28:09.100 --> 28:11.460]  attention, throw that away.
[28:11.460 --> 28:15.180]  If your jar is starting to get an ammonia smell, you've sealed it up too long and you've
[28:15.180 --> 28:18.300]  got to open it more frequently and longer next time.
[28:18.300 --> 28:20.180]  You may be able to save it, but it's unlikely.
[28:20.180 --> 28:23.640]  The only thing you can do is leave it open and let it dry out and hopefully that smell
[28:23.640 --> 28:25.180]  will go away.
[28:25.180 --> 28:28.100]  So don't leave it closed too long.
[28:28.100 --> 28:29.340]  Don't let mildew happen.
[28:29.340 --> 28:30.780]  Don't let that funky smell happen.
[28:30.780 --> 28:34.900]  Once you're past the first few days, you'll kind of be out of the mildew danger zone,
[28:34.900 --> 28:36.580]  but still be careful.
[28:36.580 --> 28:41.980]  Also keep your jars in a cool, dark place while you're curing your buds, but also don't
[28:41.980 --> 28:45.380]  leave them somewhere where you're going to forget about them.
[28:45.380 --> 28:50.780]  Also here in Colorado, I'm running a swamp cooler in the main portion, the living area
[28:50.780 --> 28:52.500]  of my house.
[28:52.500 --> 28:55.180]  Don't go dump your buds on the table near the swamp cooler.
[28:55.180 --> 28:56.780]  This is not going to do you any good.
[28:56.780 --> 28:59.820]  This is going to reconstitute them and make them wetter.
[28:59.820 --> 29:00.820]  Think about wetter.
[29:00.820 --> 29:02.220]  Is that a word?
[29:02.220 --> 29:06.180]  Anyway, think about the environment where you were drying and curing your products.
[29:06.180 --> 29:10.060]  If you're going to dump them out on the table and an attempt to get them more dry, make
[29:10.060 --> 29:14.560]  sure that the room is drier than the bud or it's not going to work.
[29:14.560 --> 29:16.160]  Just keep that kind of stuff in mind, you guys.
[29:16.160 --> 29:17.220]  Think about your environment.
[29:17.220 --> 29:18.880]  Think about your products.
[29:18.880 --> 29:22.960]  So I feel like we've got a basic understanding of how to cure our buds.
[29:22.960 --> 29:29.480]  Now let's get into the technical talk about why we do it and what's technically happening.
[29:29.480 --> 29:33.880]  So curing your buds properly makes your buds burn and smoke smoothly, and it also brings
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.680]  out the best flavors and aromas.
[29:36.680 --> 29:40.320]  Proper drying and curing will also increase your potency.
[29:40.320 --> 29:41.320]  Now why?
[29:41.320 --> 29:42.320]  Why does that happen?
[29:42.320 --> 29:44.320]  Because your buds contain chlorophyll.
[29:45.080 --> 29:49.760]  Chlorophyll is what gives your buds that harsh smoke and hay-like flavor, that burn-your-throat
[29:49.760 --> 29:51.320]  kind of funky flavor.
[29:51.320 --> 29:52.640]  That's from too much chlorophyll.
[29:52.640 --> 29:54.880]  That's from excess minerals in the plant.
[29:54.880 --> 29:59.760]  That could also be from an improper flush, but it's usually from an improper cure.
[29:59.760 --> 30:04.680]  So curing the buds will remove chlorophyll and increase your potency at the same time.
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.160]  The only way to remove chlorophyll is by turning it into a gas.
[30:09.160 --> 30:13.360]  Sealing our moist buds in a jar creates an environment that will break down the chlorophyll
[30:13.400 --> 30:15.200]  and turn it into a gas.
[30:15.200 --> 30:21.080]  Darkness, moisture, and oxygen will create a bacteria within the jar.
[30:21.080 --> 30:25.520]  That bacteria will break down the sugars and leftover minerals created by the decomposition
[30:25.520 --> 30:30.440]  of the chlorophyll, and it will turn into a vapor that can escape the jar when you pop
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.440]  it open.
[30:31.440 --> 30:34.320]  That was what I was talking about earlier when I said we pop open the jar and let the
[30:34.320 --> 30:35.760]  chemical reaction happen.
[30:35.760 --> 30:38.720]  Now this process is going to make your bud burn smoother.
[30:38.720 --> 30:40.600]  It's going to make it taste better.
[30:40.600 --> 30:45.200]  It's going to bring out the proper aromas, the proper terpene profile that you're looking
[30:45.200 --> 30:51.480]  for, and it's also going to increase the overall potency of your finished product.
[30:51.480 --> 30:56.080]  Now if you really want to nerd out and dial this in and create a connoisseur product,
[30:56.080 --> 30:59.840]  find yourself a hygrometer that fits inside of your mason jar.
[30:59.840 --> 31:02.680]  There are a couple available that fit right inside the mason jar.
[31:02.680 --> 31:05.640]  You can press it up to the front of the jar to where you can read the display without
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.400]  opening the jar.
[31:07.400 --> 31:12.320]  Find yourself hygrometers that will fit in the jar, and here are some suggestions on
[31:12.320 --> 31:17.080]  when to open and close your jars and how to dial them in perfectly.
[31:17.080 --> 31:23.000]  If your buds feel wet or if they are above 70% humidity, if the little display on that
[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  hygrometer inside of your jar reads above 70% humidity, you need to dump those buds
[31:29.000 --> 31:35.680]  out of the jar and let them dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity.
[31:35.680 --> 31:38.960]  Now when you dump them out and you leave them somewhere that's not by the fan, that's
[31:38.960 --> 31:42.620]  not by the swamp cooler, that's not by the air conditioner, that's not by something that's
[31:42.620 --> 31:47.160]  going to drastically affect the rate of their drying, don't forget about them.
[31:47.160 --> 31:49.160]  Set a timer and go find them.
[31:49.160 --> 31:50.760]  Some of you are a little obsessive.
[31:50.760 --> 31:52.320]  You're definitely not going to forget.
[31:52.320 --> 31:55.480]  Some of you are going to take a couple of dabs and go play Fortnite and your buds are
[31:55.480 --> 31:56.960]  going to dry up to shit.
[31:56.960 --> 31:58.400]  Don't let that happen, you guys.
[31:58.400 --> 32:01.080]  So if they are too humid, dump them out.
[32:01.080 --> 32:02.280]  Let them dry out a little bit.
[32:02.280 --> 32:05.240]  Get them down to 65 to 70% humidity.
[32:05.320 --> 32:09.560]  Now if your buds feel moist to the touch, if they're sticky and wet to the outside of
[32:09.560 --> 32:17.040]  the buds and the display reads 65 to 70% humidity, pop the lid off of that jar for 15 to 30 minutes
[32:17.040 --> 32:19.640]  and let a little moisture evaporate out.
[32:19.640 --> 32:25.120]  If you think they need longer than 15 to 30 minutes, let them go longer, but like I said,
[32:25.120 --> 32:28.640]  don't start playing Fortnite and start building shit and shooting people and forget about
[32:28.640 --> 32:31.280]  them because you don't want them to get too crunchy.
[32:31.280 --> 32:37.280]  So 15 to 30, maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour, seal them back up, set yourself a timer to
[32:37.280 --> 32:41.280]  remember to check on them in a little bit, and now you can go play Fortnite and relax.
[32:41.280 --> 32:45.100]  Now your goal is 60 to 65% humidity.
[32:45.100 --> 32:51.680]  You want that hygrometer to read between 60 and 65% humidity and you want them dry but
[32:51.680 --> 32:52.680]  not crunchy.
[32:52.680 --> 32:57.360]  They're going to feel squishy and sticky hopefully, but they're not wet.
[32:57.360 --> 33:00.120]  You just want them dry but not crunchy.
[33:00.120 --> 33:03.880]  You might need to let your buds sit out for a little bit before you roll a joint if it's
[33:03.880 --> 33:05.280]  cured perfectly.
[33:05.280 --> 33:07.960]  The display will say 60 to 65%.
[33:07.960 --> 33:11.160]  You may need to take a couple of buds out of there and set them, I just set them right
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.120]  here on the front of my computer if I'm going to roll one, it's a little warmer right there,
[33:14.120 --> 33:17.480]  just let them chill, they're not like in the path of the fan or anything, just let them
[33:17.480 --> 33:19.880]  chill right here, that's what I'm going to roll a joint with in a few minutes and just
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.480]  let them sit there, you know, just for a little bit.
[33:22.480 --> 33:25.080]  Just maybe if I'm going to go to lunch and come back and smoke a joint, I'll set them
[33:25.080 --> 33:26.760]  out right before I go to lunch.
[33:26.760 --> 33:29.280]  And then you go to lunch and then you come back and then they grind up nice and fine
[33:29.280 --> 33:34.840]  and they're still sticky, they're still juicy, and then your joint burns super smoothly.
[33:34.840 --> 33:39.000]  And if your joint's not burning super smooth, then you probably have too much moisture in
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.860]  there and you got to let it dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[33:42.860 --> 33:47.920]  Now if you hit that 55% or lower mark, you're entering what I call the Colorado crunch area
[33:47.920 --> 33:51.320]  and your buds are going to burn too fast and you're also losing weight.
[33:51.320 --> 33:54.920]  If you're working with more than a quarter pound there and you're drying it up, you risk
[33:54.920 --> 33:58.720]  losing, you know, a quarter of an ounce or whatever, depends on how much you let it dry.
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.120]  So if your buds get too dry, don't add anything funky to rehydrate them.
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.820]  The only thing I would use are fresh cannabis leaves and a little bit goes a long way.
[34:09.820 --> 34:13.960]  So take them out when the moisture comes back and don't let those leaves mold up in there
[34:13.960 --> 34:15.440]  and fuck up your crop.
[34:15.440 --> 34:17.000]  Check on them frequently.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.440]  If you put wet leaves inside of either your curing jars or your packs or your fucking
[34:22.440 --> 34:27.040]  turkey bags, however you do it, make sure you take them out and don't leave them for
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.040]  too long.
[34:28.040 --> 34:29.840]  Check on them after an hour.
[34:29.840 --> 34:31.920]  One hour is more than enough.
[34:31.920 --> 34:33.120]  Go check on it.
[34:33.120 --> 34:34.200]  Set yourself a timer.
[34:34.200 --> 34:37.640]  Don't get stuck doing an Instagram live video and forget to check on your buds.
[34:37.640 --> 34:38.640]  All right.
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.720]  So it's going to take a little bit for your hygrometer to measure the humidity in the
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.640]  jar, but it's going to get you a pretty good idea of when to open and close those jars
[34:47.640 --> 34:50.880]  and it's going to give you some actual data to go by.
[34:50.880 --> 34:54.480]  You'll be able to squeeze those buds and feel how wet they are and you'll be able to compare
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.320]  that number or that moisture to the number on the hygrometer and you'll go, oh, that's
[34:58.320 --> 35:00.080]  what 65% feels like.
[35:00.080 --> 35:02.000]  That's what Jeff's trying to get me to.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.920]  So that gives you something to work with.
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.080]  It's a little bit of a cheater, but if you're using one hygrometer, you're going to have
[35:08.080 --> 35:12.000]  to seal it into the jar for a few minutes and wait for it to get to where it needs to
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.000]  be.
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.800]  Now if it's jumping real fast, go ahead and pull it out.
[35:14.800 --> 35:15.800]  Leave that jar open.
[35:15.800 --> 35:18.680]  That means it's really humid in there and that you're just going to seal it up and cause
[35:18.680 --> 35:19.680]  problems.
[35:19.680 --> 35:20.680]  All right.
[35:20.680 --> 35:22.760]  So we've got a little tiny hygrometer in our jars.
[35:22.760 --> 35:23.760]  We're watching the numbers.
[35:24.040 --> 35:29.400]  We're trying to get ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity inside of those jars.
[35:29.400 --> 35:31.080]  Make sure you don't forget about your buds.
[35:31.080 --> 35:33.040]  Make sure you don't get that funky aroma in there.
[35:33.040 --> 35:35.380]  Make sure it doesn't smell like ammonia and mildew.
[35:35.380 --> 35:36.920]  Make sure you don't ruin it.
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.280]  You should be paying attention to the number on the hygrometer and then pulling some buds
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.960]  out and seeing what they feel like so that you know what 50, what 60, what 70, what 80%
[35:44.960 --> 35:45.960]  humidity.
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.220]  If you get to 80, you fucked up, but so that you know what the percentage of humidity feels
[35:49.220 --> 35:51.640]  like inside these jars, what the bud feels like.
[35:51.640 --> 35:53.000]  This will give you a really good idea.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.040]  So you're paying attention to that stuff and you will get ahead of the drying and curing
[35:57.040 --> 35:58.040]  game.
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.040]  Now, once you've gotten your buds dried and cured to 55 to 65% humidity and you don't
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.120]  see any fluctuation inside that jar on the hygrometer, you only need to crack them open
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.320]  to check on them or pull out some buds to smoke.
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.520]  You don't need to keep popping those jars open.
[36:12.520 --> 36:13.840]  They're going to get too dry if you do that.
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.680]  So you can trap the moisture in there, leave it right at that point and your bud will be
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.040]  perfectly cured for whenever you need it.
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.880]  Now, I've said before that I don't like the Boveda packs, but they work if you do fuck
[36:23.880 --> 36:24.880]  up.
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.440]  The Boveda packs I would buy are the 62% and you can just drop them right inside your jar.
[36:29.440 --> 36:32.680]  It'll help reconstitute that package or that jar.
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.760]  And then sometimes I feel like they leave kind of a watery flavor on the buds, but I
[36:36.760 --> 36:42.040]  guess I'd rather have a properly cured bud that has that aroma than some Colorado crunch
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.040]  that's just going to burn up when I light my joint at the show.
[36:45.040 --> 36:48.600]  So ladies and gentlemen, that is my dry and cure episode.
[36:48.600 --> 36:49.940]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[36:49.940 --> 36:52.420]  If you have questions, please send them to me.
[36:52.420 --> 36:55.860]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[36:55.860 --> 37:00.620]  I would love to continue the conversation and clear up anything I left out for you.
[37:00.620 --> 37:01.620]  Just let me know.
[37:01.620 --> 37:05.700]  Also, this is a good time for me to recommend my Patreon campaign.
[37:05.700 --> 37:11.540]  Patreon is a website that gives you as a podcast listener the opportunity to contribute financially
[37:11.540 --> 37:13.380]  to my podcasting efforts.
[37:13.380 --> 37:16.300]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks, if you feel like you had
[37:16.300 --> 37:21.340]  some fun, if you feel like you learned something, I would encourage you to go to patreon.com
[37:21.340 --> 37:25.580]  slash growfromyourheart and sign up for my Patreon campaign.
[37:25.580 --> 37:30.180]  I know that not everybody is able to financially contribute to the show.
[37:30.180 --> 37:32.980]  I will always keep this show free for everybody.
[37:32.980 --> 37:35.020]  I want everybody to be able to hear my message.
[37:35.020 --> 37:38.020]  I want everybody to be able to improve their garden.
[37:38.020 --> 37:39.980]  I want everybody to have better medicine.
[37:39.980 --> 37:44.240]  I want better cannabis worldwide, and I'm going to do my part for free.
[37:44.240 --> 37:46.480]  But there are people who would like to contribute.
[37:46.480 --> 37:48.440]  There are people that feel like they can help out.
[37:48.440 --> 37:49.880]  I would appreciate that help.
[37:49.880 --> 37:52.240]  What I do with that funding is I pay for my website.
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.360]  I actually bought a MacBook, so I need to pay for the MacBook.
[37:56.360 --> 37:59.640]  I actually buy these little microphone covers so that when Granny and Giddy are on, they
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.340]  don't have to spit into these same microphone covers over and over again.
[38:03.340 --> 38:06.680]  So there are things like that that do need to be covered, and I do appreciate the support.
[38:06.680 --> 38:08.000]  You guys, I'm not begging.
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.100]  If you don't know that it's an option, you don't know how you can help out.
[38:11.100 --> 38:15.020]  So I do appreciate everybody that has helped out with the Patreon campaign.
[38:15.020 --> 38:17.500]  It blows my mind every month to see that come in.
[38:17.500 --> 38:18.500]  Thank you.
[38:18.500 --> 38:20.860]  Also, you guys, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[38:20.860 --> 38:22.980]  Just thanks for putting your trust in me.
[38:22.980 --> 38:24.180]  Thanks for believing in me.
[38:24.180 --> 38:27.900]  You guys are risking your gardens on my advice, and that means a lot to me.
[38:27.900 --> 38:28.900]  So thank you.
[38:28.900 --> 38:31.060]  You guys, I'm going to start wrapping up this podcast.
[38:31.060 --> 38:33.780]  I want to thank you again for listening to the show.
[38:33.780 --> 38:35.620]  Thanks for hanging out for the Dry and Cure episode.
[38:35.620 --> 38:37.260]  I hope you learned a lot.
[38:37.260 --> 38:40.860]  I will have a trimming episode coming up, and then we're going to talk about restarting
[38:40.900 --> 38:41.900]  the garden.
[38:41.900 --> 38:43.860]  I've got a bunch of great plans for the podcast.

[39:12.020 --> 39:14.260]  I drop into Instagram Live and I hang out with my friends.
[39:14.260 --> 39:17.540]  I take a few too many dabs, and we talk about growing cannabis.
