[00:00.000 --> 00:03.800]  All right, here we go. Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host Rasta Jeff joining me
[00:03.800 --> 00:06.680]  on the mic today is our friend white Mike. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:06.680 --> 00:09.020]  Thanks, man. What's up, everybody?
[00:09.020 --> 00:12.440]  Hope everybody's having a good safe evening. I hope quarantine is not getting to you too
[00:12.440 --> 00:18.120]  much. We are coming to you from a stormy and rainy and thunderous night in Colorado. So
[00:18.120 --> 00:22.200]  if you guys hear weird noises in the background, nobody fell down the stairs. There are no
[00:22.200 --> 00:26.000]  dump trucks driving through the living room. That is thunder that you were hearing. I don't
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.960]  know how much of that will come through Mike's mic or my mic. But if you hear noises, we
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.080]  are safe. Nobody fell down the stairs. We are going to survive. You guys, it's time
[00:34.080 --> 00:39.360]  for episode 539 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Thank you for hanging out. This episode

[01:20.680 --> 01:24.320]  about what we're smoking. Mike, I just watched you take a couple of dabs a moment ago. I
[01:24.320 --> 01:28.040]  thought I was going to have to call 911 and give them your address. I thought I may have
[01:28.040 --> 01:33.000]  to text your wife and have her come check on you. What are you dabbing over there?
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.080]  Just getting through the last of my apothecary stash, man. I got just a little bit of sour
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.000]  diesel ambrosia left. About to clean out the last of my stash of that. It's time to go
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  shopping again, man.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.040]  Dude, I'm getting close to the shopping time as well. I've been trying to go to the dispensary
[01:49.040 --> 01:54.200]  less and less during the COVID times. I don't need to go expose myself and put the bud tenders
[01:54.200 --> 01:58.280]  at risk extra times, but they limit us on purchases here in Colorado. So you can only
[01:58.280 --> 01:59.640]  buy so much on the rec side.
[01:59.640 --> 02:01.280]  You can only stock up so much.
[02:01.280 --> 02:05.440]  Yeah. And of course the budget's only so fat. So you can only do so well. But yeah, I try
[02:05.440 --> 02:09.360]  not to go. It's almost time for me as well. You're always a sour diesel guy. If there's
[02:09.360 --> 02:11.320]  diesel available, I'm sure you'll take it.
[02:11.320 --> 02:14.240]  Yup. Yeah. I'm a sucker for a good diesel.
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.960]  I am over here smoking on something called Lush Cherry Full Spectrum Extract from Green
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.440]  Dot Labs. This is a blend of copper chem and cherry cush mints. The flavor on the jar is
[02:24.440 --> 02:30.240]  described as leather, cherry, and gas. I get the cherry. I get the gas. I've never eaten
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.520]  leather. So I'm not sure that it tastes or smells like leather. That's, that's, I'm fucking
[02:35.520 --> 02:38.840]  not even going to eat. Nevermind. We won't go there. My vegetarian diet.
[02:38.840 --> 02:39.840]  Calahite Terps.
[02:39.840 --> 02:42.840]  Yeah. Calahite Terps. It's not for me. It smells good. It tastes great. It gets me stoned,
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.400]  obviously. I'm over here rambling about fucking leather Terps. What really impressed me was
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.160]  this was a four gram jar. I found this at a random dispensary in our town. Not a place
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.160]  I normally shop. They said, Hey, we got four gram jars of the Green Dot. Stop by, check
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.440]  them out. The fucking diamonds in this jar. I'm going to try to show it to the camera.
[02:59.440 --> 03:01.880]  I have consumed most of this jar.
[03:01.880 --> 03:02.880]  Big old diamonds.
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.240]  There are a couple of chunky diamonds left in there. I'm trying to, there you go.
[03:06.240 --> 03:07.240]  There you go.
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.240]  The diamonds in here were amazing.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.240]  Look, some teeth.
[03:09.240 --> 03:14.760]  A billionth of the size of teeth. It was a beautiful ratio of Terp sauce to big diamonds.
[03:14.760 --> 03:20.160]  Beautiful presentation. The presentation means a lot to me. The color, the texture, the smell,
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.360]  beautiful concentrate. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs. On the back, it
[03:23.360 --> 03:32.320]  does say 69.24% total THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. I dig it. The rest of that
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.960]  has just got to be Terps because it tastes so good.
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.680]  Matt was here yesterday and I took a dab. And as soon as I blew out the dab, he wasn't
[03:39.680 --> 03:42.360]  even like watching, he was playing with his phone and I blew out the dab and he goes,
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.000]  that smells like California was just what his face said. Like he just blurted out, that
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.340]  smells like, it sounded like Ralphie just in the corner, Ralphie Wiggum. That smells
[03:49.340 --> 03:53.840]  like California. It was just really autopilot. It was pretty funny of him. So that's what
[03:53.840 --> 03:57.800]  we're smoking guys. Mike's got some Apothecary. I've got some Green Dot, you know, Colorado
[03:57.800 --> 04:04.080]  staples. Mike just leans in and said, big words for the show, Mike. Thanks for all the
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.080]  enthusiasm.
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.200]  Happy to help bro.
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.760]  Speaking of help, let's give some shout outs to the people who support the show on Patreon.
[04:11.760 --> 04:15.720]  Thank you. Let's give a giant shout out to our friend Bong Breath. I love anybody named

[05:43.960 --> 05:49.840]  big shout out, big thanks to everybody who supports the show on Patreon. Mike, do you
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.600]  have anything you would like to ramble about before we get into the listener emails? Because
[05:53.640 --> 05:55.680]  I need a minute to get my face in check.
[05:55.680 --> 06:01.160]  I just want to say thank you to the people that have hit up my Patreon and everybody
[06:01.160 --> 06:06.440]  who's commented about the new video format. Keep the feedback coming. I think everybody
[06:06.440 --> 06:10.320]  likes the video shows. We like doing them. So you're probably gonna get some more of
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.320]  them.
[06:11.320 --> 06:16.200]  You know, the video shows are fun. I like you being here, but the time that you drive
[06:16.200 --> 06:19.640]  here, we get to just hang out and do a longer show. So you don't have to drive here.
[06:19.640 --> 06:23.240]  It's nice to be able to talk for an extra 40 minutes instead of spending that in the
[06:23.240 --> 06:26.000]  car on the way home and on the way back. Yeah, it's nice.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.720]  And then allegedly you don't have to drive home after being here for two hours, taking
[06:28.720 --> 06:31.800]  dabs with me. You could take that big, if you would have taken that dab you just took
[06:31.800 --> 06:35.000]  at my house, I'd have been like, well, he's not leaving for like fucking two and a half
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  hours after that thing.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  I'm gonna be here a while.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.400]  Yeah. I'd have to fucking make you a sandwich. Yeah. It would have been a minute. And big,
[06:41.400 --> 06:46.120]  yeah. Like Mike said, big shout out to everybody for all of the video feedback. I love doing
[06:46.120 --> 06:49.880]  the video. I thought it would be a lot more work now that I've gotten a little more comfortable
[06:49.880 --> 06:53.960]  with the editing and I understand how to do it and what my goal is. If I would just stop
[06:53.960 --> 06:58.240]  trying to make fancy subtitles and intro screens and outro videos, the shit would take way
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.640]  less time, but I'm getting good at it. It's fun. I like it. So yeah, you'll keep seeing
[07:02.640 --> 07:06.840]  video coming from us. I'm liking what I'm doing. We've got more video guests lined up,
[07:06.840 --> 07:10.400]  some more cool things in mind and planned. So thank you guys.
[07:10.400 --> 07:15.800]  Yeah. I mean, there's a little bit of positive coming out of this whole lockdown mess and
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.360]  Jeff getting good at video editing is one of them things.
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.520]  Yeah. This would not have happened without the, uh,
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.440]  Shout out to boredom.
[07:22.440 --> 07:27.040]  That is very true. No pandemic. We would not have had this. All right. I want to quit talking
[07:27.040 --> 07:30.200]  about the quarantine. Everybody is sick of hearing about that shit. They don't want to
[07:30.200 --> 07:32.840]  come listen to a podcast to hear me talk about being locked down. They want to hear about
[07:32.840 --> 07:37.200]  positive energy. They want to come here and enjoy it. They want to have a good time. So
[07:37.200 --> 07:38.200]  let's get some,
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.200]  What's growing on that buddy?
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.360]  What's growing on. I don't know if we can use that. That might be another podcast catchphrase,
[07:42.360 --> 07:47.760]  but yeah, that's right. Mark. Yeah. Oh man. Uh, we're going to have to have a paintball
[07:47.760 --> 07:52.760]  battle over this one. I'm just joking. No, no hate mail. We're just joking. A shout out
[07:52.760 --> 07:55.920]  to all. If anybody knows what what's going on, came from what I was talking about. Uh,
[07:55.920 --> 08:01.040]  high five fist bump gang, gang. Uh, I want to read a message that came from Patreon.
[08:01.040 --> 08:04.000]  This came from our friend Tyler. I don't know if they, how much of their name they want
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.400]  said, but it's from Tyler and Kay. Also, I don't know how much of Kay's name they want
[08:07.400 --> 08:11.800]  read. Uh, but they say, Hey Ross to Jeff. We love your show. Keep up the good work.
[08:11.800 --> 08:15.840]  Also, I caught a few minutes of your Insta the other night and you mentioned the upcoming
[08:15.840 --> 08:20.800]  Jack the Ripper project. I can't wait to see what you come up with. Also, you mentioned
[08:20.800 --> 08:25.080]  saving a few F ones. I think I may have said F twos. I'm not sure what you mean. Uh, I
[08:25.080 --> 08:29.080]  would love to get in on that. Thanks again for all of you do from T and K and then they
[08:29.080 --> 08:32.400]  even signed where they're from. I'm not going to read your location, but I didn't know that
[08:32.400 --> 08:35.800]  was why I didn't realize that was where you were. We've corresponded a lot. Holy shit.
[08:35.800 --> 08:39.320]  I didn't know that was where you were. Uh, that's a cool place. Pretty cool. Um, very
[08:39.320 --> 08:43.680]  beautiful. I don't have to go visit. Uh, so on my Instagram live feed, I was talking
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.600]  about my current breeding project. Mike, I'm looking for a Jack the Ripper male. I think
[08:47.600 --> 08:52.040]  I showed you those plants. They look amazing under the LEDs. I think I found the male,
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.600]  which I want to use. He's going to pollinate a few select females. One of those females
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.380]  will also be a Jack the Ripper female. So we can make F two seeds that way. We can kind
[09:01.380 --> 09:04.720]  of make more of those seeds in honor of my buddy, subby. A lot of people love Jack the
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.280]  Ripper. I want to kind of continue that genetic line. It's so awesome. It's so cool. I'm going
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.520]  to breed with it as a male. So that means I really trust it. Uh, it's going to hit a
[09:13.520 --> 09:17.560]  couple of my select three select females are in the room to get pollinated. I mentioned
[09:17.560 --> 09:22.240]  that on my Instagram live. Make sure you check out my Instagram live. My life I'm Iree underscore
[09:22.240 --> 09:28.400]  genetics on Instagram. Every Monday, approximately 7, 10 PM mountain time. I go on Instagram
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.560]  live. I do a show very similar to this. I hang out. I talk shit. I take dabs, but there
[09:32.560 --> 09:37.000]  is no script. There are zero notes. I let the people in the chat run the show. They
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.480]  type in comments. I answer their questions. As long as you're not a Dick, as long as you're
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.480]  cool and you hang out, I'll try to reply to you and chat with you. Uh, take some dabs
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.640]  and bullshit and it's more loose. It's more of a friendly vibe. But in that live chat,
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.660]  Tyler heard me mention that I am breeding to the Jack the Ripper and Tyler is excited
[09:53.660 --> 09:58.320]  to get some of the F ones and possibly the F twos that come from that project. When I
[09:58.320 --> 10:08.080]  mentioned this idea on that live chat, my phone started vibrating across the table.
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.360]  I had to chase it down like it was a dog getting out of my fucking control. The plants are
[10:13.360 --> 10:21.000]  in veg, like they're in veg. The first round of seeds are in veg. Yeah. Yeah. They haven't
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.680]  the nobody, maybe one of, maybe one or two of the Jack the Ripper seedlings has kind
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.080]  of shown sex, but that's all we've gotten so far. They're not even in flower. So I need
[10:30.080 --> 10:35.920]  70 days to flower them approximately, you know, 60, 70, 75, depends on what they do.
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.440]  Uh, then we've got to, uh, this is round one. That's the starter. That's phase one round
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.280]  one. And then we will grow out some of the seeds and see if they were worth a shit to
[10:45.280 --> 10:49.760]  even make. And then if they were, then we'll send a few of them out to some of our friends.
[10:49.760 --> 10:53.720]  Maybe this person here, since they've been such a long time, Patreon helper, we may let
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.840]  them be a tester of the first batch, but they've got to grow. They've got to be harvested.
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.040]  They've got to be taken from the plants. They've got to be counted and put into a little spreadsheet.
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.360]  So I know how many seeds I've got, then they're going to get, I'm going to germinate. I'm
[11:07.360 --> 11:10.720]  going to put about a hundred of them in a container and germinate them and count how
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.880]  many of them do not pop. And if we don't get at least a solid number, I won't even send
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.040]  them out to testers. If we get a solid number, I'll grow a bunch of them. The testers will
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.040]  grow a bunch of them. Once the testers show me they're reliable, then we can think about
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.520]  putting them to market. So you're looking at 70 days for them to flower from the day
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.000]  I put them into flower, which I don't expect to do so for about 14 more days. So 84 days
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.320]  before they're even done, 10 days to dry, 94 days, six days for me to fuck around because
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.400]  sometimes I get thrown off schedule. There's a hundred days before we can even think about
[11:43.400 --> 11:47.800]  the first batch of seeds being touched.
[11:47.800 --> 12:07.480]  I don't know if that came up on the camera, but that vibrated my whole chair. That was
[12:07.480 --> 12:16.160]  amazing. I won't have the first batch of seeds flowered until around spring of 2021. Cool.
[12:16.160 --> 12:24.760]  That's pretty good. I won't have these seeds flowered out until spring of 2021 is basically
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.600]  where we are. Valentine's day, March, April ish of 2021 is when these first batch of seeds
[12:30.600 --> 12:35.440]  will be available for me to see what they do. So it's a long ways off. Dude, I appreciate
[12:35.440 --> 12:38.360]  your enthusiasm. I'm not yelling at you. I'm not calling you out. I'm not shutting you
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.600]  down. I'm just saying be very patient. Yeah. Holy shit, dude. I just said, I'm going to
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.520]  do this. I need a minute. I you're first in line, bro. You're first in line. Don't
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.400]  worry. But yeah, we'll, we'll put you on the hypothetical waiting list. I'm sure you'll
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.800]  send me a message. Uh, but I love you guys to get so enthusiastic about stuff, but it's
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.080]  going to be a little while. So if I don't reply to your request for the Jack, the ripper
[12:59.080 --> 13:04.240]  crosses dude so far, their thoughts and hopes and dreams. You got to make that happen. Are
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.680]  you posting photos of this project anywhere, bro? Uh, sometimes I'm posting good, good
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.200]  fucking Q bro. Good segue there. Shameless plug. Sometimes I do post pictures of the
[13:13.200 --> 13:19.440]  Jack, the ripper progeny on my IRI genetics Instagram. It's IRI underscore genetics. And
[13:19.440 --> 13:25.480]  just a photo you posted that was sick. That node spacing is just ridiculous, dude. That
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.040]  is from, and that's another shameless plug right there. That is from the Canon lighting
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.160]  from black sale market. They, uh, we've got a little test batch with some cannons in there
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.440]  and those plants are happy. Mike, since you gave me a shameless plug for my Instagram,
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.280]  you posted a really cool picture today that I think is flexing on some people. Uh, can
[13:42.360 --> 13:47.440]  you tell the folks how they can find you on Instagram? Um, it's a, at Nemo punk 15, man,
[13:47.440 --> 13:54.640]  easy to find Nemo punk 15. Sometimes I tag him in some stuff. I use the grow from your
[13:54.640 --> 13:59.320]  heart podcast, uh, Instagram. And sometimes I tag Mike and stuff in there. I don't Instagram
[13:59.320 --> 14:05.120]  very much. It's, it's pretty rare. And when I do, it's, it's kind of poorly done. I don't
[14:05.120 --> 14:11.320]  Instagram. Well, your post today is my favorite, nice and simple. Just a nice bottle of ISO.
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.840]  I wasn't going to tell him what it was. 99. When he posted that, I was like, my rig feels
[14:16.840 --> 14:23.520]  clean. Yeah. I've got 91. I had to go to wall greens. I had to buy a wall greens to find
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.480]  it. And also shout out to my mom. My mom is a super shopper and showed up over here with
[14:29.480 --> 14:32.360]  some rubbing alcohol. She's like, yeah, I know you buy a shit ton of this and there's
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.320]  nowhere to get it. So here you go. And I was like, Oh, you brought gold to my house lady.
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.680]  In the move I found, I must've gone shopping and hit the Walmart and bought four bottles
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.080]  and I brought it home. It was still in the fucking Walmart bag and the Walmart bag had
[14:45.080 --> 14:49.640]  sat there long enough to have like tobacco stain on it. I just would have been there
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.560]  for fucking like eight months. And right before the lockdown happens, I find four bottles
[14:54.560 --> 15:01.680]  on open 91. Like it was a nice score. Like toilet paper and bullets right now. Yeah.
[15:01.680 --> 15:04.800]  I would like to keep the show moving. Mike, I love our random banter. People like it.
[15:04.800 --> 15:08.360]  They say that it's like they're hanging out with us. So someone smoking a joint laughing
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.280]  about our fucking toilet paper conversation right now. I do have another great email.
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.480]  I've got a couple more lined up. This one comes from a person. It doesn't say their
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.920]  name. So we're going to skip that. It says, Hey bud, I've been growing for a couple of
[15:18.920 --> 15:22.880]  years and I really got into it in the past six months and I've listened to the dude grow
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.360]  show and that's how I found you. And now I follow you. Big shout out to our friends at
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.800]  the dude grows. Thanks for discovering me through them. Yeah. Thanks to everybody over
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.240]  there. Not just the, uh, the folks on the side, on that side of the camera, the people
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.120]  in the production and the people listening, uh, big friends, big family to all of them.
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.040]  I goes on to say, I really liked the strains you use and I want to pull the trigger on
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.360]  a pack from seeds here now.com. And I wanted to know what two strains of yours you would
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.720]  recommend to a rookie grower growing in Coco Loco with new millennium nutrients. Uh, wait,
[15:53.720 --> 15:58.680]  isn't what I'm after. I'm looking for good turps and fire smoke. Thanks in advance, bro.
[15:58.680 --> 16:04.280]  Keep the good content coming. This is a great message. Um, first of all, I would be a bad
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.800]  host and a bad friend if I did not remind you to use coupon code G F Y H 10 while you're
[16:08.800 --> 16:13.280]  checking out at seeds here now.com that will save you 10% off. It's a small order that
[16:13.280 --> 16:17.960]  at least cover shipping. If it's a large order that adds up quite quickly. Now the strains
[16:17.960 --> 16:23.780]  that I would recommend, uh, he said for a beginner and a rookie grower growing in Coco
[16:23.780 --> 16:28.120]  new millennium nutrients, uh, weight is not an issue. That's really not a big deal. Most
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.960]  of what I breed puts out the freaking weight. Uh, yeah, most of my cuts come from commercial
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.040]  grows and I'm, I'm, I understand you got to put out weight, uh, looking for good turps
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.600]  and fire smoke and then thanks in advance. Hey, thank you for listening. Thank you for
[16:40.600 --> 16:45.000]  the great email. I feel like I recommend the same, same strains all the time, but for a
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.760]  beginning grower, uh, if you want feminized seeds, I would definitely recommend the orange
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.440]  chasm. Orange chasm is a champion. It's very forgiving. It doesn't take very long to grow.
[16:56.760 --> 17:01.240]  Well, everybody loves that citrus turp too. Everybody loves that citrus. Listening to
[17:01.240 --> 17:05.120]  that email, my thought, my first question would be like, well, what turp are you into?
[17:05.120 --> 17:11.360]  Do you want earthy, fruity, you know, point me in a direction. Exactly. And the orange
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.560]  chasm is a nice sort of wheelhouse one. It's the orange turp is just real smooth. It's
[17:15.560 --> 17:21.840]  not too intense. It's always a favorite. It's super easy to grow and the buzz from it is
[17:21.840 --> 17:27.200]  really nice. It's like good smile. It's like all day long cannabis. You can smoke it all
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.960]  day. If you smoke it right when you get up, you're smiling and you're bouncing. If you
[17:30.960 --> 17:34.480]  smoke it right after lunch, you're ready to go back to work. And if your job sucks, who
[17:34.480 --> 17:38.520]  cares? I just smoked some orange chasm. I'm in a good fucking mood. If it's evening time,
[17:38.520 --> 17:41.680]  want to chill out and watch a movie, chill out and watch a movie, smoke some orange chasm.
[17:41.680 --> 17:47.680]  It'll put a smile on your face, smoke it before bed. And I get the best like colorful cartoon
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.200]  Simpsons-y looking fucking dreams. It is so amazing. Yeah. So I would recommend orange
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.280]  chasm to start. That's a feminized strain. It's really easy to grow. You'll get short
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.200]  flowering phenotypes. You'll get eight and nine week flowering phenotypes in there. That
[18:01.200 --> 18:07.600]  doesn't take super long. The less time, the less opportunity to fuck things up. Also,
[18:07.600 --> 18:11.360]  it smells and tastes and smokes amazing, makes great concentrates. You'll get good harvest,
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.080]  good smoke, good turps. I think it's an all around champion. Now, if you want to expand
[18:16.080 --> 18:22.000]  and do something non-feminized, I would recommend the Prana or the Morning Dew. Those are both
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.160]  really easy for beginners. The Prana is super vigorous, really easy to grow. Again, it doesn't
[18:28.160 --> 18:33.680]  take super long to flower. It's got a really nice buzz to it. Really unique, funky, hippie,
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.880]  stanky feet kind of aromas, really unique flavors and aromas. When people grow Prana,
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.920]  they're always like, wow, that was bright lightning. When people grow Prana, they're
[18:42.080 --> 18:47.120]  like, what do you call these weird smells? I say it smells like the Hindu shop on Mass
[18:47.120 --> 18:50.960]  Street or on that big street. I can't think of the name of the street in Massachusetts,
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.800]  Newbury Street in Mass. It's exactly what it smelled like when I walked in there, feet and
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.800]  curry and incense and weirdness. It was delicious, but that strange smell is unique. The Prana or
[19:00.800 --> 19:07.200]  the Morning Dew. The Morning Dew is an SFOG, an SFOG, Chem 91, cross with some other stuff in there.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.200]  It's through the rise. The Morning Dew- It's pretty forgiving too.
[19:11.200 --> 19:15.520]  Yeah, it's really easy to grow. You can beat the shit out of it and you'll get good harvest and
[19:15.520 --> 19:21.680]  lots of gassy, earthy, berry kind of funky turps come out of that one and good colors too. If
[19:21.680 --> 19:26.400]  you're trying to take photography, that Morning Dew will give you some awesome colors and so will
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.360]  the Prana. Those are three great recommendations for you. Also, anything from the turtles line,
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.160]  any of the turtles will grow well. The three bad guys don't grow as easily. The Shredder
[19:36.160 --> 19:41.280]  grows really well. Bebop and Rocksteady are more challenging. The four TMNT crosses will grow like
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.960]  a champ, very similarly to that Orangegasm. Hey, that was a great message. They did not include
[19:46.960 --> 19:50.960]  their name and their email, so I'm not going to say it. They know who they are. Big thanks. I do
[19:50.960 --> 19:55.040]  appreciate the wonderful email and let me know when you get some seeds. I want to know what you
[19:55.040 --> 20:01.200]  selected and also I want to see pictures of the grow as things progress. I love seeing photos of
[20:01.280 --> 20:06.080]  my seedlings turning into giant plants and giant colas and then you see them turn into
[20:06.080 --> 20:10.400]  fucking concentrates. I love seeing the progress. Yeah, keep us updated, folks.
[20:11.120 --> 20:15.440]  All right, we've been going for a minute. I think I'm going to move to this other message right here.
[20:16.160 --> 20:20.400]  Mike and I kind of talked about this one for a brief moment before the show. I'm looking to see
[20:20.400 --> 20:26.160]  how long we've been going. We've been going for 20 minutes. Okay, yeah, sorry. I can't read my
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.640]  own handwriting. I was really confused. That's a three. That's a five. That means 20 minutes.
[20:30.640 --> 20:35.840]  Okay, this message says, this one comes from Patreon also. If you'd like to help us out on
[20:35.840 --> 20:42.000]  Patreon, it is patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. It goes a lot like this. Hey,
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.360]  Rasta Jeff, it says I'm doing some research about all this stuff and I'm growing in a four-pot
[20:47.360 --> 20:52.080]  recirculating deepwater culture system, which I built. That goes on a lot, talks about deepwater
[20:52.080 --> 20:56.640]  culture, drilled the holes, keeping the water levels correct. Here's the part we need to get
[20:56.640 --> 21:01.760]  to. It says I'm using eight net pots and I also have RO water, but I can use a mixture of RO and
[21:01.760 --> 21:07.840]  tap water if my tap water is good. So they're basically asking, they've got access to RO water.
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.400]  They've also got regular tap water. They're asking, basically, it's a really long message with a lot of,
[21:12.400 --> 21:15.920]  it's hard to read to tell you the truth. I think they were driving and typing, but
[21:15.920 --> 21:20.880]  thanks for the message. They've got RO water and they've got tap water. They're asking if they can
[21:20.880 --> 21:29.360]  mix the RO and the tap water. You could, but that would be like cleaning your water and then dumping
[21:29.360 --> 21:35.760]  it back in with dirty water and having kind of clean water. You already did work and RO water,
[21:35.760 --> 21:41.040]  you waste a lot of stuff and you're using filters and membranes and electricity and time. So either
[21:41.040 --> 21:46.400]  do or don't would kind of be my opinion. I'm not sure the reasoning for wanting to do both.
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.440]  Yeah, I definitely, if you've got RO water, I'd use it or don't.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.880]  Yeah. RO water can be a little bit more challenging to buffer when it comes to pH.
[21:56.880 --> 22:00.480]  Getting the pH accurate is a little bit more challenging. There's nothing in there to keep it
[22:00.480 --> 22:02.240]  stabilized. The...
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.640]  Yeah, I've seen more disconnected RO systems than I've seen operational RO systems.
[22:06.640 --> 22:09.760]  That was something I was going to add to the sort of the end of that, but that is true.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.360]  Not to be a dick about it, but that's just my personal experience.
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.160]  If you have got good tap water, the way to find out you've got good tap water is to run some tests
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.960]  on it, run an EC test on there, run a PPM test on there. If the numbers are acceptable, you've got
[22:22.960 --> 22:28.160]  good water. If something seems higher than it should be, maybe go to the local water company's
[22:28.160 --> 22:31.840]  website and see exactly what they're adding into the water. There will be a chart that shows what
[22:31.840 --> 22:35.600]  they're putting in your local municipal water. Then you can find out, do I need to work on
[22:35.600 --> 22:41.520]  removing things? In most cases, I know that I'm generalizing, but in most places, if you can drink
[22:42.480 --> 22:47.360]  the water without making a funky face, it will probably be okay for the plants. I can't guarantee
[22:47.360 --> 22:51.440]  that. There's Flint, Michigan. People are going to say, what about Flint? I said, if you can drink
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.280]  it without making a funky face. So if your tap water is good, use the tap water. In a commercial
[22:57.280 --> 23:03.840]  environment, in most cases, I do not use RO because it is harder for the crew to adjust the pH once we
[23:03.840 --> 23:10.000]  mix. I do use a big boy filter. The big boy filter takes out most of the stuff that I'm worried about,
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.640]  and there is not nearly as much waste. I would not recommend mixing the water.
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.080]  I don't have a good analogy. You're going to clean water and then pour it back in with the
[23:22.080 --> 23:27.680]  not clean water. You're going to get either semi-clean or semi-dirty water, depending on how
[23:27.680 --> 23:35.200]  optimistic or pessimistic you are at that point. Definitely one or the other, if you ask me.
[23:35.520 --> 23:41.440]  For sure. When we talked about this email originally, that question struck me as
[23:42.160 --> 23:48.960]  particularly odd. Yeah, I agree with you. That's why we addressed that one here at the end.
[23:50.880 --> 23:55.520]  Pick one, one or the other. I don't see a reason. Unless your water is bad, I don't see a reason to
[23:55.520 --> 24:00.240]  use the RO. If your water is good, use that tap water. Unless you really want to be super in
[24:00.240 --> 24:04.560]  control, it is fun to see exactly what you're putting in there, but it is not necessary.
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.440]  Are all your pots connected? Yeah, you got a four pot container, eight gallon containers. Yeah,
[24:11.440 --> 24:16.000]  it's all connected together. We can't do any experimenting. We can't do side by sides.
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.200]  I think you will be fine without the RO, to tell you the truth. If you've got a small boy or a big
[24:23.200 --> 24:30.560]  boy, that would be ideal, but don't mix them. I don't think that is the way to go. I wouldn't
[24:30.560 --> 24:35.680]  mix them. Yeah. So we voted. We say, don't mix them. Pick one, pick the other, go with that.
[24:35.680 --> 24:39.840]  I'm not sure what your approach is. Yeah. If you'd like to send me another message, letting me know
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.040]  what your intent is, let me know why you've thought about using the two. Maybe we could go
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.800]  a little further and give you a little bit better advice. And if necessary, I can call a friend
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.440]  who's more of a water expert, and then we can see what they're thinking at that point. But so far
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.800]  with the information I've got, we've taken a vote, pick one, stick with it. We can do a phone a friend
[24:58.800 --> 25:02.720]  question with the Zoom shit. Yeah, we sure could. Or I could just call them before the show, or I
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.680]  could Google. We've got a lot of options. But with the information we've got, Mike, I think we've gone
[25:07.680 --> 25:14.560]  as far as we can go down that path. Next rabbit hole. Next rabbit hole. I think the next rabbit
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.280]  hole is to start wrapping up this episode, bro. We've been going for close to 30 minutes here. By
[25:19.280 --> 25:22.720]  the time we get done doing these outros, we'll be hitting the 30 minute mark. Do you have any words
[25:22.720 --> 25:30.400]  of wisdom for the final portion of the podcast? Just smoke a joint and smile a little. Yeah,
[25:30.400 --> 25:36.800]  that's, it's getting hot. Enjoy it. It is starting to get warm. It is so nice. I'm trying to dig out
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.640]  the shorts for these fucking tall white legs. I'm not sure that I want to punish the world with
[25:40.640 --> 25:47.520]  these pasty summer legs. Yep, I got the shorts out. It's a lockdown, man. You don't have to
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.520]  expose the crew at work to those pasty legs. It's just your sad ass backyard. Oh, I don't want to
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.120]  talk too much about the quarantine, but I am excited for it to get over. I'd like to get out
[25:57.120 --> 26:01.040]  there and get some sunshine, go see some people. I just want to go sit at the park. We don't even
[26:01.040 --> 26:04.560]  have to do anything. If it's just there are three people at the park and we can see each other like,
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.080]  hey, what's up? There's people here. I haven't seen you in a while. That'd be really cool.
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.760]  I know we're not trying to talk about the quarantine at all, but like,
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.040]  so my next door neighbor tonight had one of those drive by and everybody honk birthday things.
[26:18.480 --> 26:25.440]  And like on the one hand, like bummer on the other hand, cool. But like the kids were like,
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.280]  why is everybody honking? We got to go watch it. So we went out front. And the first thing
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.840]  that struck me, cause there were like six cars in a row that had like the worst possible age
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.200]  for teenagers, like in the car, there were two or three of them, like 12, 13, 14, 15,
[26:41.200 --> 26:46.720]  like the real fucking asshole years. And all of the kids were off their phones, like into it,
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.400]  waving. Oh, that is cool. And at first it struck me as odd. It just looked weird. Like
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.600]  something's wrong about this picture. Find, find what's missing or whatever. You know what I mean?
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.560]  And then I was like, oh man, all these teenagers are really into something. This kind of cheesy,
[27:03.360 --> 27:09.760]  like, fuck, we've been locked down a long time. Like everyone is so starved for slightly different
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.640]  that like, hey kids, do you want to go get in the car and drive by so-and-so's house and wave for
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.360]  his birthday? They're like, fuck yeah. Let's go drive six blocks and wave at people.
[27:20.560 --> 27:21.840]  That's our level of excitement.
[27:22.400 --> 27:26.560]  Yeah. It's brave new world. But yeah, that was kind of cool to see.
[27:27.280 --> 27:29.920]  It's fun. That's the new birthday party, drive by and honk.
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.200]  Yep.
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.120]  Makes it a lot easier. And then just throw an Amazon gift card at you as I drive by. Good
[27:35.120 --> 27:35.600]  luck, bro.
[27:37.120 --> 27:42.320]  They, uh, yeah, they were collecting the big poster board signs that they were driving by
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.120]  and waving. That's pretty neat. Yeah.
[27:45.120 --> 27:47.360]  All right. So that is birthdays with Mike and Jeff.
[27:47.920 --> 27:50.720]  Yep. Birthdays in the time of COVID.
[27:50.720 --> 27:51.920]  I want to thank everybody for hanging out.
[27:51.920 --> 27:52.720]  Two guys coughing.
[27:52.720 --> 27:55.680]  Dude, you stole my line, bro. I was going to say, I want to thank everybody for hanging out,
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.320]  checking out two guys coughing. This was a really fun episode, Mike. Very entertaining. We got some
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.480]  news out. We got some emails answered. We got some Patreon questions resolved and we had a good
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.360]  ass time. It was good to see you, dude. This was a good hangout time for the evening.
[28:07.920 --> 28:12.560]  Yeah. If listeners, if you've got something you'd like us to talk about, a story you'd like us to
[28:13.200 --> 28:18.880]  opine on, a question you'd like us to answer, feel free to shoot us an email or a tweet or a
[28:18.880 --> 28:25.280]  Facebook message or an Instagram DM. That's a way to contact the two of us these days.
[28:25.440 --> 28:32.640]  Best way is through the growfromyourheartathotmail.com email. Another really good option,
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.800]  a good way to get your question on the show is through Patreon. You go to patreon.com forward
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.000]  slash grow from your heart. There is a tier that I almost damn near guarantee I will get you our
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.040]  email on the next episode. So sign up through Patreon, send me a message through Patreon,
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.280]  and I check those Patreon messages right before I start recording. And if I've got one up there,
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.880]  I will get it on the episode I'm going to record or the one that comes right after that,
[28:54.880 --> 28:59.360]  depending on how long it is. But I do my best to get to the Patreon questions. I've got one more
[28:59.360 --> 29:02.320]  here in front of me that I've got to save for another episode because I want to put a little
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.960]  bit of time and effort into that one. I don't want to speed through it, but go to Patreon.
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.920]  That's the best way to get your questions on. Mike also said you can tweet us. My Twitter is
[29:11.920 --> 29:17.600]  at GFYH podcast is probably the best way to get ahold of me on Twitter. Mike, do some social media
