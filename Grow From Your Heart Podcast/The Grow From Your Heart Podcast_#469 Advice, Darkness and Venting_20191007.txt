[00:00.000 --> 00:02.760]  All right, here we go, a little Monday show for you.
[00:02.760 --> 00:03.760]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:03.760 --> 00:08.840]  It is time for episode 469 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.840 --> 00:12.120]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:12.120 --> 00:17.000]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.200]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:25.200 --> 00:29.000]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.680]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Headbanger Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green
[00:33.680 --> 00:34.800]  Dot Labs.
[00:34.800 --> 00:38.500]  This is a blend of sour diesel, IBL, and biker kush.
[00:38.500 --> 00:42.140]  On the package, the flavor is described as sour and fuel.
[00:42.140 --> 00:47.440]  It is completely sour, it is completely fuel-y, and it is completely extra funky.
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.360]  It smells like a lemonade gas pump, and that is a perfect aroma when it comes to a concentrate.
[00:53.360 --> 00:57.440]  So it's got that delicious aroma, it's got a delicious flavor, then the appearance of
[00:57.440 --> 00:59.040]  this concentrate is perfect.
[00:59.040 --> 01:00.960]  I've got a big four-gram jar.
[01:00.960 --> 01:06.000]  It looks like a nice jar of iced tea or terp tea, if you will.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.960]  I've got some nice icebergs floating around in here, some nice diamonds, a perfect ratio
[01:10.960 --> 01:12.720]  of diamonds to terp sauce.
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.600]  I really enjoy the appearance.
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.360]  Again, the aroma and flavor are tremendous, and if you can't tell, the high from this
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.760]  concentrate is fucking excellent.
[01:21.760 --> 01:25.680]  It went straight to my head, it lifted me up, it made me energetic, it made me want
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.360]  to come to a podcast, it made me just want to talk my face off.
[01:29.360 --> 01:31.680]  Let's flip the jar over here and check out the potency label.
[01:31.680 --> 01:37.620]  On the back of the jar, it says that this product contains 66.31% THC.
[01:37.620 --> 01:42.840]  It does not contain any CBD, and I do imagine that if we had a terp test on this product,
[01:42.840 --> 01:47.600]  the terping numbers would be ridiculous because as soon as you open this jar, you can smell
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.720]  it from across the room.
[01:49.720 --> 01:55.840]  So big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and ridiculous Headbanger
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.080]  Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.200]  All right, podcast world, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[02:02.200 --> 02:05.540]  Before I get there, I would like to do some shout outs to our friends who support the
[02:05.540 --> 02:07.920]  show on Patreon.
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.160]  Let's start off with the big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.560]  to my buddy Stabby McStabwood.
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.840]  How about a big shout out to our buddy Gabriel?
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.920]  I want to send a big thank you to JM.
[02:17.320 --> 02:19.840]  How about a big thank you shout out to Todd K?
[02:19.840 --> 02:22.920]  Of course, I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our buddy

[02:23.920 --> 02:26.920]  As always, a big thank you shout out to Jacob W.
[02:26.920 --> 02:29.600]  I want to give a big thank you shout out to Keith K.
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.000]  And of course, last but certainly not least, I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.280]  podcast shout out, thank you, and a fist bump to our friend OG Purple Thumb.

[02:44.440 --> 02:46.860]  I do appreciate all of the support.

[02:50.860 --> 02:57.220]  so by visiting www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:57.220 --> 03:01.100]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:01.100 --> 03:05.340]  All right, podcast world, before we get to the email portion of the show, I want to talk
[03:05.340 --> 03:08.780]  about some fun that I got to have recently.
[03:08.780 --> 03:12.780]  If you listened to the last episode, I'm sure you heard me mention that I was accidentally
[03:12.780 --> 03:15.300]  hitting my vape pen in a comedy show.
[03:15.300 --> 03:18.420]  So I'm going to talk about those comedy shows for a few minutes here.
[03:18.420 --> 03:22.460]  Over the weekend, my buddy Clint came over and we headed up to Denver together.
[03:22.460 --> 03:26.820]  We got some food and then we went to a couple of wonderful comedy shows.
[03:26.820 --> 03:29.820]  We started the evening off, as I said before, we got some good food.
[03:29.820 --> 03:32.700]  We had dinner at the Mellow Mushroom, big shout out to the Mellow Mushroom and shout
[03:32.700 --> 03:35.540]  out to Clint for buying me dinner, had a great dinner.
[03:35.540 --> 03:39.340]  Then we headed over to the Comedy Works to see Brendan Schaub.
[03:39.340 --> 03:44.580]  If you don't know about Comedy Works, Comedy Works is one of the top three, maybe top two
[03:44.580 --> 03:49.140]  best comedy clubs in the country, if not on the entire planet.
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.700]  I am a giant comedy nerd.
[03:50.700 --> 03:52.100]  I love comedy shows.
[03:52.100 --> 03:53.100]  I love comedians.
[03:53.100 --> 03:55.660]  I love going to comedy shows and laughing my ass off.
[03:55.660 --> 04:00.820]  I go to Comedy Works quite frequently, so I am treated like royalty at Comedy Works.
[04:00.820 --> 04:04.220]  So we headed to Comedy Works to see one of my favorite comedians.
[04:04.220 --> 04:07.180]  I listened to a podcast called The Fighter and the Kid.
[04:07.180 --> 04:11.300]  I also listened to another podcast called The King and the Sting.
[04:11.300 --> 04:13.860]  There was a guy who was on both of those podcasts.
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.060]  His name is Brendan Schaub.
[04:15.060 --> 04:17.060]  He is a pretty funny comedian.
[04:17.060 --> 04:19.340]  He is a retired UFC fighter.
[04:19.340 --> 04:20.340]  He is a fashion model.
[04:20.340 --> 04:22.780]  He is an all-around funny dude.
[04:22.780 --> 04:24.980]  I think he is hilarious.
[04:24.980 --> 04:29.060]  So as soon as I heard that Brendan Schaub was coming to his hometown of Denver, Colorado
[04:29.060 --> 04:33.140]  to perform at one of the best comedy clubs on the planet, I knew I had to grab a couple
[04:33.140 --> 04:37.340]  of tickets to go show some Fighter and the Kid love, to go show some King and the Sting
[04:37.340 --> 04:41.220]  love, to go see one of my favorite comedians, Brendan Schaub, in his hometown.
[04:41.580 --> 04:45.100]  I'm glad I decided to go because it was a great show.
[04:45.100 --> 04:48.260]  When we got in, they treated us like royalty from the very beginning.
[04:48.260 --> 04:49.580]  We got VIP wristbands.
[04:49.580 --> 04:51.140]  We got parking passes.
[04:51.140 --> 04:52.860]  We got beautiful seats.
[04:52.860 --> 04:54.500]  Usually I'm right in the front at Comedy Works.
[04:54.500 --> 04:55.580]  We got there a little bit later.
[04:55.580 --> 04:56.820]  They didn't put me right in the front.
[04:56.820 --> 04:59.420]  They had a little VIP meet and greet thing going on.
[04:59.420 --> 05:02.180]  So some people paid extra for fancy tickets.
[05:02.180 --> 05:06.260]  So they put me about three rows back and I really enjoyed that third row spot.
[05:06.260 --> 05:09.460]  My neck wasn't as cranked as it usually is trying to look at the front row.
[05:09.700 --> 05:12.020]  It was kind of nice to be right in the third row.
[05:12.020 --> 05:13.580]  So that was fucking awesome.
[05:13.580 --> 05:14.580]  Really great seats.
[05:14.580 --> 05:17.620]  They brought us a couple of snacks, got us some non-alcoholic drinks because Clint and
[05:17.620 --> 05:19.580]  I do not consume alcohol.
[05:19.580 --> 05:20.580]  So we got settled in.
[05:20.580 --> 05:25.780]  The show began and the host and MC of the evening was a great comedian whose name was
[05:25.780 --> 05:27.460]  Assange Ahmad.
[05:27.460 --> 05:31.620]  If you guys are comedy fans, pay attention to Assange Ahmad.
[05:31.620 --> 05:32.620]  He is coming up.
[05:32.620 --> 05:33.620]  He is hilarious.
[05:33.620 --> 05:35.420]  You will hear of him in the future.
[05:35.420 --> 05:36.700]  Pay attention to that guy.
[05:36.700 --> 05:37.700]  He is crushing it.
[05:37.700 --> 05:38.820]  So he came out.
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.180]  He hosted the show.
[05:40.180 --> 05:42.140]  He basically walks out and he says, Hey, this is my name.
[05:42.140 --> 05:43.140]  Welcome to the show.
[05:43.140 --> 05:45.500]  He tells you a couple of rules about the comedy club.
[05:45.500 --> 05:47.340]  Basically shut the fuck up and listen.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.340]  Don't heckle.
[05:48.340 --> 05:49.340]  Fire exits are that way.
[05:49.340 --> 05:50.340]  Have a good time.
[05:50.340 --> 05:52.980]  Buy a shirt, buy drinks, tip the waitress.
[05:52.980 --> 05:53.980]  Here's the rest of the show.
[05:53.980 --> 05:58.220]  Then he brings out another comedian and I got really excited because he said, you know
[05:58.220 --> 06:01.100]  him as the voice of the King and the Sting.
[06:01.100 --> 06:04.500]  And I knew it wasn't Theo because he's the other member of the King and the Sting.
[06:04.500 --> 06:07.140]  And I knew he was in another city doing a show.
[06:07.140 --> 06:08.140]  So I got excited.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.460]  Is it?
[06:09.460 --> 06:13.260]  And he said, ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring to the stage Mr. Derek Poston.
[06:13.260 --> 06:18.100]  And Derek Poston is the producer of a podcast called the King and the Sting, which also
[06:18.100 --> 06:19.540]  features Brennan Schaub.
[06:19.540 --> 06:23.980]  I was really excited to put a face on Derek Poston because I hear him weekly.
[06:23.980 --> 06:26.080]  It was good to finally see the dude.
[06:26.080 --> 06:31.260]  And honestly, his comedy blew the fucking room apart.
[06:31.260 --> 06:34.460]  That dude was hilarious.
[06:34.460 --> 06:40.180]  I was not prepared to be blown away by Derek Poston the way I was.
[06:40.180 --> 06:44.620]  He did maybe 15 or 20 minutes, but it felt like 30 minutes of laughter.
[06:44.620 --> 06:49.420]  It is hard for a comedian to take the entire room with a very short amount of time.
[06:49.420 --> 06:51.420]  It takes a few minutes to suck people in.
[06:51.420 --> 06:53.660]  He walked out on stage and he's like, what's up motherfuckers?
[06:53.660 --> 06:54.660]  I'm funny.
[06:54.660 --> 06:56.320]  You're going to laugh and then I got to go.
[06:56.320 --> 06:57.460]  And that's how it went.
[06:57.460 --> 06:58.460]  We fucking laughed.
[06:58.460 --> 06:59.460]  I almost pissed my pants.
[06:59.460 --> 07:03.160]  And then he's like, now are you ready for Brennan Schaub?
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.800]  Brennan Schaub came out and he did a lot of material.
[07:05.800 --> 07:08.640]  I did not know that Schaub had that much material.
[07:08.640 --> 07:11.240]  He just put out a special on Showtime recently.
[07:11.240 --> 07:15.320]  And most of the time, once a comedian puts out a special, they don't do that material
[07:15.320 --> 07:16.320]  anymore.
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.600]  It's like, you've heard those jokes.
[07:17.600 --> 07:19.680]  We don't want to fucking tell those jokes anymore.
[07:19.680 --> 07:20.960]  It's called burning the material.
[07:20.960 --> 07:22.440]  You put it out and you move on.
[07:22.440 --> 07:23.440]  You write a whole new hour.
[07:23.440 --> 07:26.240]  Then you go do that material in clubs for a year.
[07:26.240 --> 07:28.160]  Maybe do that material in theaters for a year.
[07:28.160 --> 07:30.200]  Then you go back and record another special.
[07:30.200 --> 07:32.160]  At that point, that material is burnt.
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.520]  You don't get to do it anymore.
[07:33.520 --> 07:37.600]  Yes, there are some bits that people will do over and over again, like the machine story
[07:37.600 --> 07:43.400]  with Bert Kreischer and then anything Andrew Dice Clay, but those are comedic anomalies.
[07:43.400 --> 07:44.540]  Those don't fucking count.
[07:44.540 --> 07:46.760]  Most of the time, people don't want to hear your shit twice.
[07:46.760 --> 07:49.520]  Once you know the punchline, the joke isn't funny anymore.
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.920]  So I was blown away and impressed with the amount of material that Schaub brought to
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.460]  the stage.
[07:55.460 --> 08:02.380]  One thing I really enjoy is when I hear somebody from a podcast on a stage telling a story
[08:02.380 --> 08:07.180]  or doing a bit about stuff that developed on the podcast recently.
[08:07.180 --> 08:12.580]  I really like watching that comedic mind and watching that comedic snowball happen.
[08:12.580 --> 08:17.040]  Two guys are on a podcast talking and something funny about, I don't know, a white guy with
[08:17.040 --> 08:20.500]  dreadlocks and a vape pen comes up just in the funny conversation.
[08:20.500 --> 08:23.380]  And then you hear him tell a joke about it for two minutes and then you hear it taper
[08:23.380 --> 08:25.580]  off and then you hear it on the next episode.
[08:25.580 --> 08:27.500]  They kind of make another stupid joke about it.
[08:27.500 --> 08:30.660]  That's called a callback when you bring that up and you talk about it again and then it
[08:30.660 --> 08:34.980]  fades and then you go see him in a podcast or on a comedy show two weeks later and he's
[08:34.980 --> 08:38.500]  got 30 minutes about it and you almost piss your pants because you saw it develop and
[08:38.500 --> 08:40.220]  you know that that's organic.
[08:40.220 --> 08:44.260]  That joke came from just a normal conversation between two dudes and it is now a polished
[08:44.260 --> 08:50.060]  and honed bit that made, I think Comedy Works holds about 250, maybe 320 people.
[08:50.060 --> 08:54.780]  So it made 300 people piss their pants with laughter from a little joke that developed
[08:54.780 --> 08:55.780]  on the podcast.
[08:55.780 --> 08:57.580]  So I think that that is great to see.
[08:57.580 --> 09:00.900]  Also I like seeing the influences in comedians.
[09:00.900 --> 09:03.220]  I said earlier I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[09:03.220 --> 09:05.140]  You guys, this is just going to be a quick rant about comedy.
[09:05.140 --> 09:06.140]  We'll move on to cannabis.
[09:06.140 --> 09:09.300]  I know I've gone way too long about this, but I like seeing the roots.
[09:09.300 --> 09:12.780]  I like looking at a comedian and saying, oh, you sound like this guy and this guy and this
[09:12.780 --> 09:13.780]  guy.
[09:13.780 --> 09:16.220]  So it was really fun watching the influences in Shaab.
[09:16.220 --> 09:20.220]  There were a couple of moments when I said that was completely Brian Callen.
[09:20.220 --> 09:22.140]  That was completely Joe Rogan.
[09:22.140 --> 09:27.500]  That was completely Chris D'Elia, but that's okay because you're just absorbing your influences.
[09:27.500 --> 09:28.500]  So that was fun to see.
[09:28.500 --> 09:29.500]  It was fun to see Shaab.
[09:29.500 --> 09:30.500]  Shaab crushed it.
[09:30.500 --> 09:32.020]  He did a really good job.
[09:32.020 --> 09:34.700]  Big shout out to all three of the comedians at that show.
[09:34.700 --> 09:36.480]  Big shout out to Brennan Shaab.
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.300]  Big shout out to Derek Poston and big shout out to Assange Ahmad.
[09:40.300 --> 09:42.260]  I got to meet everybody after the show.
[09:42.260 --> 09:44.060]  Like I said, there was a little meet and greet.
[09:44.060 --> 09:47.980]  I got to have a very brief conversation with Brennan Shaab.
[09:47.980 --> 09:49.660]  He said, hey, I love the dreads.
[09:49.660 --> 09:51.860]  And I looked him straight in the face and said, no, you don't, bro.
[09:51.860 --> 09:53.540]  And he gave me a bewildered look.
[09:53.540 --> 09:54.940]  And I said, I listen to your podcast.
[09:54.940 --> 09:57.860]  I know how you feel about stupid white guys with dreadlocks.
[09:57.860 --> 10:00.820]  And he made a face like, ah, shit, I've offended people.
[10:00.820 --> 10:03.260]  And then there was a guy taking pictures and he just goes, picture?
[10:03.260 --> 10:05.400]  So we both look at the camera and we do our pose.
[10:05.400 --> 10:07.940]  The photo happens and I look back at him and I go, bro, I'm just joking.
[10:07.940 --> 10:11.260]  I love that you make fun of white people with dreadlocks on the podcast.
[10:11.260 --> 10:12.340]  You're a comedian.
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.900]  Don't ever stop doing comedy.
[10:13.900 --> 10:14.900]  And he laughed at me.
[10:14.900 --> 10:16.340]  He goes, okay, man, he felt better.
[10:16.340 --> 10:18.980]  Like I set him up to like, I was like, man, I know what you said about white people and
[10:18.980 --> 10:20.380]  then white people dreadlocks.
[10:20.380 --> 10:21.380]  And then I let him feel relief.
[10:21.380 --> 10:22.980]  Like, man, I think it's funny that you say that.
[10:22.980 --> 10:25.300]  I can't be offended because I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[10:25.300 --> 10:27.140]  I expect jokes about white people with dreadlocks.
[10:27.140 --> 10:28.940]  That's how it goes being this guy.
[10:28.940 --> 10:30.620]  So when I said that, he felt relief.
[10:30.620 --> 10:32.180]  I could see it in his face.
[10:32.180 --> 10:33.180]  And then I just shook his hand.
[10:33.180 --> 10:34.180]  I told him thank you.
[10:34.180 --> 10:36.460]  And I was walking away and I got a few feet away and he goes, hey, bro.
[10:36.460 --> 10:37.460]  And I was like, what's up, man?
[10:37.460 --> 10:39.780]  I turned around and he goes, how long you been growing them things?
[10:39.780 --> 10:40.780]  And I said, 15 years.
[10:40.780 --> 10:42.860]  And he goes, you sure have.
[10:42.860 --> 10:44.380]  So that was really fun and entertaining.
[10:44.380 --> 10:47.940]  Then I walked outside and got to spend a minute with the two other comedians.
[10:47.940 --> 10:50.000]  Derek Poston is fucking hilarious.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.020]  Very friendly, very approachable.
[10:52.020 --> 10:55.140]  Also Assange Ahmad, very friendly, very approachable.
[10:55.140 --> 10:56.980]  Had a short conversation with both of them.
[10:56.980 --> 11:01.900]  Then I got to meet a young man who goes by the name of Shark Eyes Doll Smile, also known
[11:01.900 --> 11:06.740]  as Jay Shob, kind of a popular guy if you listen to any of the T Fat K or King and the
[11:06.740 --> 11:07.740]  Sting type of podcasts.
[11:07.740 --> 11:09.300]  So I got to shake his hand.
[11:09.580 --> 11:11.340]  Got to tell him that he does great artwork.
[11:11.340 --> 11:13.940]  I just got to hang out with all those dudes for a couple of minutes.
[11:13.940 --> 11:15.060]  That is always a good time.
[11:15.060 --> 11:19.260]  So big shout out to that entire gang, the comedians and Jay Shob.
[11:19.260 --> 11:21.860]  Big shout out to Brennan Shob for bringing a show here.
[11:21.860 --> 11:23.780]  This was his hometown, so it was kind of funny.
[11:23.780 --> 11:25.420]  His mom was heckling him.
[11:25.420 --> 11:28.820]  He would tell jokes and you could just hear his mom giggle with pride.
[11:28.820 --> 11:30.300]  That was fucking funny.
[11:30.300 --> 11:34.020]  Just to hear everybody laugh and then his mom laugh a couple of extra times.
[11:34.020 --> 11:37.180]  And then he would do the thing where you kind of put your hand, it's not the thumb across
[11:37.180 --> 11:38.780]  the throat like you're killing somebody.
[11:39.260 --> 11:42.500]  It's the fingers across the neck like cut it out, cut it out, you're done.
[11:42.500 --> 11:47.420]  He was giving his mom the look of disapproval, the skeptical hippo eyebrows, and then giving
[11:47.420 --> 11:48.740]  her the cut it out mom.
[11:48.740 --> 11:50.060]  But it was just cute and it was funny.
[11:50.060 --> 11:51.900]  It was like, oh, come on mom.
[11:51.900 --> 11:53.420]  But it was funny because the crowd was in on it.
[11:53.420 --> 11:54.420]  We all know it's his hometown.
[11:54.420 --> 11:56.100]  We know that that was his mom in the back.
[11:56.100 --> 11:57.100]  It was fucking funny.
[11:57.100 --> 12:01.860]  So big old shout out to that whole gang, gang, gang, buzz, buzz, culture, culture.
[12:01.860 --> 12:02.860]  That shit is awesome.
[12:02.860 --> 12:05.060]  If you know what that means, then you're in the gang with us.
[12:05.060 --> 12:06.060]  That was a great time.
[12:06.340 --> 12:11.060]  I also need to send a special shout out to everybody at Comedy Works.
[12:11.060 --> 12:16.660]  Everybody at that club treats myself and whoever I bring like fucking royalty, like rock stars.
[12:16.660 --> 12:17.660]  I love it.
[12:17.660 --> 12:18.660]  Go to Comedy Works.
[12:18.660 --> 12:21.500]  If you want to see a comedy show, if you want to get some laughter, if you want to take
[12:21.500 --> 12:25.180]  somebody on a date, if you've got somebody to take a business meeting or something like
[12:25.180 --> 12:28.820]  that and you need to take them somewhere, go to Comedy Works, go catch a comedy show.
[12:28.820 --> 12:31.700]  The only thing is you got to kind of shut up for a little bit, but you can share that
[12:31.700 --> 12:35.100]  laughter and then on the car ride on the way home, you have a lot of things to talk about
[12:35.140 --> 12:38.140]  because the comedians are going to bring up points and you get to look at each other like,
[12:38.140 --> 12:40.140]  do I agree or do I disagree with this person?
[12:40.140 --> 12:41.860]  And you can talk about that in the car.
[12:41.860 --> 12:44.580]  So go get some laughter, go have a show.
[12:44.580 --> 12:47.860]  Then it will create conversation with your date, with your business partner.
[12:47.860 --> 12:49.140]  It is a great fucking time.
[12:49.140 --> 12:50.780]  Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[12:50.780 --> 12:52.460]  Shout out to all my friends at Comedy Works.
[12:52.460 --> 12:55.780]  Also big shout out to Tall Clint for being a cool comedy bro.
[12:55.780 --> 12:56.780]  He's not my date.
[12:56.780 --> 12:57.780]  He's just my bro, you guys.
[12:57.780 --> 12:58.780]  We have a good time.
[12:58.780 --> 13:00.820]  He's much easier than taking a fucking date.
[13:00.820 --> 13:03.620]  So after the Brendan Schaub show, we were not done.
[13:03.620 --> 13:04.900]  We got to meet everybody.
[13:05.700 --> 13:11.340]  And we walked about 15 minutes to the Belco Theater where we got to see what another comedy show.
[13:11.340 --> 13:13.020]  I know it's kind of crazy.
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.020]  I was a little spent.
[13:14.020 --> 13:15.300]  My laughter muscles were done.
[13:15.300 --> 13:16.300]  My cheeks hurt.
[13:16.300 --> 13:21.500]  My tummy was a little bit sore from laughing so hard, but it was time to get more comedy going.
[13:21.500 --> 13:23.100]  So we went to the Belco Theater.
[13:23.100 --> 13:25.780]  I've talked about the Belco Theater before on this show.
[13:25.780 --> 13:29.140]  Big beautiful theater inside of the Denver Convention Center.
[13:29.140 --> 13:30.140]  Nice comfortable place.
[13:30.140 --> 13:31.500]  We got a bottle of water.
[13:31.500 --> 13:34.340]  We got our seats, chilled out for a couple of minutes.
[13:34.340 --> 13:36.060]  They made the announcement that no phones.
[13:36.060 --> 13:40.060]  If you get your phone out, you are leaving, basically is what they said.
[13:40.060 --> 13:44.100]  Then the lights went out and this young man by the name of Jeff Tate came out and did
[13:44.100 --> 13:45.100]  a few minutes.
[13:45.100 --> 13:46.100]  Jeff Tate is a very good comedian.
[13:46.100 --> 13:48.340]  I'm sure you've heard me speak of him before.
[13:48.340 --> 13:53.100]  Not the Jeff Tate from Queensryche, a different Jeff Tate, the funny Jeff Tate, the funnier
[13:53.100 --> 13:54.780]  Jeff Tate at least.
[13:54.780 --> 13:55.780]  He came out.
[13:55.780 --> 13:56.780]  He did a few minutes.
[13:56.780 --> 13:57.780]  I told a couple of jokes.
[13:57.780 --> 13:59.620]  He was mostly funny.
[13:59.620 --> 14:04.700]  Then after that, the man, the myth, the legend, the fucking offensive one, Mr. Tom Segura
[14:04.700 --> 14:09.100]  came out and blew the roof off of the Belco Theater.
[14:09.100 --> 14:12.140]  It's hard to say he blew the roof off of the place because he's mellow.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.700]  He doesn't get real fired up.
[14:13.700 --> 14:15.620]  When you see Rogan, Rogan yells at you.
[14:15.620 --> 14:18.420]  When you see Joey Diaz, Diaz yells at you.
[14:18.420 --> 14:23.620]  Tom Segura has more of a mellow, slower delivery with kind of a condescending tone to it that
[14:23.620 --> 14:24.940]  just hits in a different way.
[14:24.940 --> 14:25.940]  It's darker.
[14:25.940 --> 14:30.260]  Instead of being yelled some crazy shit that makes you laugh after the idea is pounded
[14:30.260 --> 14:33.100]  into your head, he'll say something.
[14:33.100 --> 14:35.340]  He could say a normal sentence.
[14:35.340 --> 14:36.740]  Think of a normal sentence that would be fine.
[14:36.740 --> 14:37.740]  I don't have an example.
[14:37.740 --> 14:41.580]  Then just add two words to it, with my dick.
[14:41.580 --> 14:43.180]  That makes every sentence creepy.
[14:43.180 --> 14:46.980]  Anything you say, if you add the words with my dick to the end of it, it's fucking subtle
[14:46.980 --> 14:49.580]  and it's gross and everybody gets that it's a joke.
[14:49.580 --> 14:50.900]  He'll just say something.
[14:50.900 --> 14:52.060]  That's not a Tom Segura joke.
[14:52.060 --> 14:53.940]  I'm killing his ideas of jokes.
[14:54.260 --> 14:57.300]  He'll tell you a story and then end it with my dick.
[14:57.300 --> 15:00.580]  That's when everybody gets a huge laugh and his stories are fucking great.
[15:00.580 --> 15:01.580]  He is offensive.
[15:01.580 --> 15:05.780]  If you want to be offended, please check out some Tom Segura comedy.
[15:05.780 --> 15:08.180]  He will piss you off in the best way.
[15:08.180 --> 15:11.380]  That's my favorite kind of comedy, so check that out.
[15:11.380 --> 15:12.380]  That was a great night.
[15:12.380 --> 15:15.700]  I got to see Brennan Shaab, Derek Poston, Assange Ahmaud.
[15:15.700 --> 15:18.300]  I got to see Jeff Tate and I got to see Tom Segura.
[15:18.300 --> 15:21.620]  I was honestly blown away by Derek Poston.
[15:21.620 --> 15:23.980]  I can't give him enough credit and enough props.
[15:23.980 --> 15:25.900]  Pay attention for Derek Poston.
[15:25.900 --> 15:28.020]  He is going to blow you away in the near future.
[15:28.020 --> 15:30.620]  Of course, Tom Segura was the highlight of the evening.
[15:30.620 --> 15:31.900]  That was fucking awesome.
[15:31.900 --> 15:34.700]  Then we headed back to the car, bumped into a friend on the way to the car, got to give
[15:34.700 --> 15:38.020]  a good friend a hug just randomly walking down the street in Denver.
[15:38.020 --> 15:39.580]  There was a beautiful friend, said, hey, what's up?
[15:39.580 --> 15:41.740]  Gave her a hug, kept walking, got to the car.
[15:41.740 --> 15:43.660]  We headed back.
[15:43.660 --> 15:45.820]  Normal evening, great safe drive home.
[15:45.820 --> 15:46.820]  That was a fun time.
[15:46.820 --> 15:48.900]  Big shout out to Clint for being a great comedy buddy.
[15:48.900 --> 15:51.020]  I've given him a shout out on the show for that before.
[15:51.420 --> 15:53.500]  Dude, let's go to more comedy shows.
[15:53.500 --> 15:55.340]  Joey Coco Diaz is coming up.
[15:55.340 --> 15:58.100]  If you're at the Joey Show, I look forward to seeing you at the Paramount Theater.
[15:58.100 --> 15:59.100]  Give me a high five.
[15:59.100 --> 16:02.760]  All right, so that is wrapping up the comedy adventure.
[16:02.760 --> 16:03.760]  What else did I do?
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.220]  Just because it's on my mind and I went there and it was fucking awesome, let's talk about
[16:07.220 --> 16:09.220]  this quick road trip I took.
[16:09.220 --> 16:12.940]  Just a couple of days ago, I drove to Evergreen, Colorado.
[16:12.940 --> 16:16.060]  The only place I really mentioned that is because holy shit, it was beautiful and I
[16:16.060 --> 16:21.300]  cannot stop thinking of the way the place felt and smelled and just the vibe and the
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.420]  energy there.
[16:22.420 --> 16:23.500]  It was really calming.
[16:23.500 --> 16:26.180]  It was really peaceful and it was so beautiful.
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.500]  It was just the right temperature.
[16:27.500 --> 16:30.240]  It was the first kind of cool day in Colorado.
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.900]  So I didn't have my hoodie on, but I kind of wish I did, but I enjoyed that brisk, cool
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.460]  mountainy air.
[16:35.460 --> 16:37.060]  There's no traffic up there.
[16:37.060 --> 16:39.740]  Lots of beautiful animals, lots of beautiful scenery.
[16:39.740 --> 16:43.140]  And everybody I spoke to in Evergreen was like, hey, buddy, how you doing?
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.160]  Are you having as beautiful of a day as I am?
[16:45.260 --> 16:46.840]  It was just fucking excellent up there.
[16:46.840 --> 16:47.840]  So it's a great place.
[16:47.840 --> 16:50.120]  A big shout out to Evergreen, Colorado.
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.120]  Don't move there.
[16:51.120 --> 16:52.120]  It's overcrowded.
[16:52.120 --> 16:53.120]  They don't need more people.
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.120]  Stay away.
[16:54.120 --> 16:55.120]  Let's just keep it fucking beautiful.
[16:55.120 --> 16:56.120]  All right.
[16:56.120 --> 16:57.120]  Now I'm going to press pause.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.120]  I'm going to take a drink.
[16:58.120 --> 16:59.120]  I'm going to take like 47 dabs.
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.920]  Then we're actually going to get into the cannabis portion of this podcast.
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.760]  Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[17:05.760 --> 17:09.020]  All right, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, pimps and hoes, smokers and growers, friends
[17:09.020 --> 17:11.680]  and foes, friends and fam, I am back.
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.200]  I am well medicated.
[17:13.200 --> 17:14.680]  I am well hydrated.
[17:15.200 --> 17:18.200]  It is time to get into the email portion of the show.
[17:18.200 --> 17:19.200]  Let's jump right into it.
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.440]  The first email for this episode goes just like this.
[17:22.440 --> 17:28.240]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I hope everything is going iry for you on this lovely Tuesday.
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.880]  I'm reading this on a Friday.
[17:29.880 --> 17:32.360]  You are probably listening on a Monday.
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.560]  Everything still iry.
[17:34.560 --> 17:37.360]  The message goes on to say, my name is, oh, let's skip that.
[17:37.360 --> 17:38.840]  I don't know if you want your name said.
[17:38.840 --> 17:44.120]  It says, my name is blank and I am 22 and I've been growing for about four years total
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.360]  and I started at my parents' house growing outside.
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.240]  By the time I got to having 10 three-foot tall plants in one area was when I realized
[17:52.240 --> 17:58.080]  that I have a passion for growing cannabis and I want to go about this legally.
[17:58.080 --> 17:59.520]  That is a very common story.
[17:59.520 --> 18:00.920]  A lot of people start growing.
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.440]  They realize that it is very fulfilling in many ways.
[18:04.440 --> 18:06.480]  First off, you have your own cannabis that you grew.
[18:06.480 --> 18:10.560]  That is absolutely instantly gratifying and rewarding, but there is something that comes
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.000]  with growing your own cannabis that is just fulfilling and a lot of people have a passion
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.400]  for producing their own product.
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.560]  Our friend here quickly realized that they have a passion for growing cannabis and they
[18:21.560 --> 18:23.960]  wanted to go about it legally.
[18:23.960 --> 18:24.960]  The message continues.
[18:24.960 --> 18:30.200]  It says, I attended a hands-on certified cannabis college and shortly after I applied for a
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.640]  grow position at, and I'm not going to say the name of the company, but they applied
[18:33.640 --> 18:36.280]  for a position and got hired on the spot.
[18:36.280 --> 18:37.280]  That is awesome.
[18:37.280 --> 18:41.000]  You went to a certified cannabis college to give yourself some credentials there and then
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.640]  you went and applied and you were hired immediately.
[18:43.640 --> 18:45.240]  Let's find where I was in the email.
[18:45.240 --> 18:48.080]  It says, so I moved from one location to another.
[18:48.080 --> 18:50.720]  I'm going to leave out your locations because I want to keep you safe.
[18:50.720 --> 18:52.880]  I don't know who may hear this down the road.
[18:52.880 --> 18:55.880]  We don't want to put you in any jeopardy, so we're going to keep all your locations
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.680]  and names kind of secret, but it says, I've moved locations since then and that's where
[19:00.680 --> 19:04.400]  this new business is located and I've been here for two years.
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.240]  I am now leading a building with multiple rooms that are this size.
[19:09.240 --> 19:11.880]  I'm not going to say that because those are too many clues.
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.160]  If other people hear this, they'll know that this is you.
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.800]  It says, I've got a hundred or so plants in each room.
[19:17.800 --> 19:24.680]  I average 80 to 90 pounds dry weight per 18 HPS lights per room.
[19:24.680 --> 19:30.320]  So you're saying you get 80 to 90 pounds out of 18 HPS lamps per room.
[19:30.320 --> 19:32.960]  I'm really curious how long you're vegging.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.480]  I'm really curious how you're doing that.
[19:34.480 --> 19:37.320]  Deepwater culture, hydro, soilless mix.
[19:37.320 --> 19:38.320]  Are you on tables?
[19:38.320 --> 19:39.760]  I want to know about your genetics.
[19:39.760 --> 19:42.720]  I'm trying to do the math in my head quickly while I'm talking.
[19:42.720 --> 19:44.320]  That's over three pounds per light.
[19:44.320 --> 19:45.880]  That's 3.6 pounds per light.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.520]  I'm actually going to pull out a calculator here and do that.
[19:48.520 --> 19:49.520]  Let's see what this says.
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.320]  We are going to divide 90 pounds, divide about 18 lights.
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.320]  That's five pounds.
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.200]  Okay, I did poor math in my head there, but we've got five pounds per light.
[19:58.200 --> 19:59.200]  That's fucking impressive.
[19:59.200 --> 20:00.600]  I would like to believe you.
[20:00.600 --> 20:01.920]  Doesn't sound very likely.
[20:01.920 --> 20:02.920]  Let's keep reading.
[20:02.920 --> 20:07.520]  To be completely honest, man, I only know what this company has taught me and from some
[20:07.520 --> 20:08.520]  of the old heads.
[20:08.520 --> 20:12.600]  With that being said, I don't know if it's good, decent, or super bad.
[20:12.600 --> 20:17.080]  If you were genuinely pulling four to five, maybe six pounds per light, that's impressive.
[20:17.080 --> 20:18.320]  You need to keep doing that.
[20:18.320 --> 20:20.360]  Again, I can't see the quality of the product.
[20:20.360 --> 20:22.240]  I don't know if you're even trimming it.
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.840]  It could be fluffy and larfy shit.
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.440]  I could pull you five pounds per light if I don't trim it, but I don't know if anybody
[20:27.440 --> 20:28.440]  wants that.
[20:28.440 --> 20:30.480]  I'm going to do math again just to make sure I did that right.
[20:31.040 --> 20:34.480]  90 pounds divided by 18 lights.
[20:34.480 --> 20:36.520]  That's fucking five pounds a light, bro.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.080]  That's very unlikely, very uncommon.
[20:39.080 --> 20:42.560]  You should be getting bonuses and a lot of money if you were doing that for the company.
[20:42.560 --> 20:43.760]  That is unheard of.
[20:43.760 --> 20:44.960]  I'm not going to say it's unheard of.
[20:44.960 --> 20:46.620]  That's fucking unheard of, dude.
[20:46.620 --> 20:49.200]  We like to push for two, maybe three pounds per light.
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.240]  Five pounds is a little bit ridiculous.
[20:51.240 --> 20:54.400]  Congrats if you're really pulling that, but I want to see the product.
[20:54.400 --> 20:55.400]  I want to see how it's trimmed.
[20:55.400 --> 20:58.040]  I want to see how many sticks and stems are left in there.
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.080]  I'm not doubting you.
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.200]  I'm just questioning you.
[21:00.200 --> 21:02.080]  There's a slight difference, not much though.
[21:02.080 --> 21:03.200]  I'm going to continue.
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.200]  Where am I?
[21:04.200 --> 21:07.240]  It says he doesn't know if he's doing good, decent, or super bad.
[21:07.240 --> 21:08.480]  Your harvest weight is great.
[21:08.480 --> 21:11.320]  I can't tell you anything else about the quality of the product.
[21:11.320 --> 21:12.320]  I'm going to go on.
[21:12.320 --> 21:17.040]  It says, with that being said, I know now that legalization in Florida is coming up
[21:17.040 --> 21:22.000]  and I have two investors which believe in me and they want to open a shop once the laws
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.200]  allow.
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.480]  Florida is about to legalize it sounds like, and he's got some people behind him.
[21:27.480 --> 21:29.760]  This guy wants to open up shop.
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.240]  He's working for somebody now.
[21:31.240 --> 21:34.520]  He's pulling good weight, but he's got some investors that want to pull him away and give
[21:34.520 --> 21:36.480]  him his own building it sounds like.
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.680]  This is a common thing.
[21:37.680 --> 21:38.680]  This happens a lot.
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  It's called recruiting.
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.840]  Here's what I call it.
[21:40.840 --> 21:44.040]  It says, am I approaching the industry the right way?
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.960]  Should I get any specific degrees?
[21:45.960 --> 21:49.400]  Am I at a disadvantage for only knowing how to grow commercially?
[21:49.400 --> 21:52.240]  I really don't think any specific degree would help you out.
[21:52.240 --> 21:55.400]  Maybe some kind of business degree because you're going to need to learn how to manage
[21:55.400 --> 21:56.520]  business and stuff.
[21:56.520 --> 22:00.120]  Just if you're involved in the business, you want to learn, maybe go to school just for
[22:00.120 --> 22:03.160]  the basics of business and understand that so you don't get ripped off.
[22:03.160 --> 22:08.480]  Once you get in business, people with degrees, they can rip you off just on purpose and there's
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.760]  not shit you can do about it.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.520]  They could do it in a contract right in front of you and they'll say, this is where I fuck
[22:13.520 --> 22:16.120]  you and you'll sign the paper because you don't know that that's where they wrote, this
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.880]  is where I fuck you.
[22:17.880 --> 22:20.960]  Learn a little bit about business, learn that stuff.
[22:20.960 --> 22:24.040]  Then are you screwing yourself by only knowing how to grow commercially?
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.440]  No, that's your goal.
[22:25.440 --> 22:28.720]  You are meant to be a commercial grower if that's what this new business is going to
[22:28.720 --> 22:29.720]  be.
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.320]  So focus on commercial growing, dial it in, learn as much as you can, every aspect of
[22:34.320 --> 22:35.320]  commercial growing.
[22:35.320 --> 22:38.840]  It sounds like if you're really pulling the weight that you have typed here in these numbers,
[22:38.840 --> 22:41.320]  it sounds like you've got commercial growing figured out.
[22:41.320 --> 22:45.440]  Again, you can pull 90 pounds out of the room, but if you don't trim it, dry it, cure it,
[22:45.440 --> 22:49.960]  and package it and get it to the store and it doesn't sell by the gram at 80 to 90 or
[22:49.960 --> 22:53.840]  80, 90 pounds, if that cash doesn't come into the cash register, it doesn't count.
[22:54.280 --> 22:57.400]  Being able to produce that much, it's got to be quality as well.
[22:57.400 --> 23:00.560]  I want to see the product, I'm really curious about that.
[23:00.560 --> 23:02.520]  But learn how to function in a business.
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.360]  You're going to have to go from a stoner, from a grower, from a cultivator, you're going
[23:06.360 --> 23:11.120]  to have to step up your mindset and start learning a little bit more business thought.
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.480]  Not just managing your own, but also working with other business owners and working with
[23:15.480 --> 23:16.480]  the investors.
[23:16.480 --> 23:18.600]  You're going to be playing with a lot of money.
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.760]  Learn how to not take the money and the pressure as stress.
[23:23.760 --> 23:26.720]  Think about it as, this is what I'm doing and I know how to do it.
[23:26.720 --> 23:28.880]  I'm confident, so we will be successful.
[23:28.880 --> 23:31.280]  But at the same time, know how to make wise decisions.
[23:31.280 --> 23:33.960]  You're going to have to do a lot of thinking and a lot of planning.
[23:33.960 --> 23:37.920]  So I don't recommend any specific degrees, just think about a lot of things and open
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.920]  your mind.
[23:38.920 --> 23:44.960]  Step out of the closet grower or the small mine cultivator and start thinking a million
[23:44.960 --> 23:45.960]  dollar cultivation.
[23:45.960 --> 23:49.800]  And everything you're doing, you just have to dial in every detail a little better.
[23:49.800 --> 23:51.880]  Don't let it stress you that much more.
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.720]  Don't let it step up your game that much more.
[23:53.720 --> 23:54.720]  Go the opposite.
[23:54.720 --> 23:55.720]  Don't let it scare you.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.720]  Make it make you better.
[23:56.720 --> 24:00.000]  I'm going to continue with the email because obviously these dabs are going to be fucking
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.440]  rambly today.
[24:01.440 --> 24:02.680]  So let me find my spot.
[24:02.680 --> 24:03.680]  Where am I?
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.560]  He said, am I approaching the industry the right way?
[24:05.560 --> 24:07.400]  It sounds like you're learning commercial cultivation.
[24:07.400 --> 24:11.680]  If you're pulling 80 to 90 dry pounds out of 18 lights, you are definitely figuring
[24:11.680 --> 24:13.800]  out commercial cultivation.
[24:13.800 --> 24:17.400]  Specific degrees, just keep learning how to grow, learn how to conduct yourself as a business
[24:17.400 --> 24:18.480]  person.
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.480]  Learn about HVAC, learn about all the electrical ins and outs, learn about the entire business
[24:23.480 --> 24:27.080]  from the ground up, from seed to sale, learn every aspect of it.
[24:27.080 --> 24:28.080]  Don't be afraid.
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.240]  Don't be shy to be involved in every business meeting that happens with a business that
[24:32.240 --> 24:33.240]  you're involved in.
[24:33.240 --> 24:36.640]  Just because you're the cultivator doesn't mean that you don't need to go to the packaging
[24:36.640 --> 24:39.520]  meeting, that you shouldn't be at some sort of a CEO meeting.
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.900]  Go to all that shit that you're allowed to go to.
[24:41.900 --> 24:44.020]  You should be welcome to all of that stuff.
[24:44.020 --> 24:45.200]  Be involved in your company.
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.420]  See where the money's going.
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.220]  There may be decisions that you're not even involved in that you should have input in.
[24:50.220 --> 24:51.660]  You should have some involvement in.
[24:51.660 --> 24:52.660]  Involve yourself.
[24:52.660 --> 24:53.660]  That's the bottom line.
[24:53.660 --> 24:55.420]  Involve yourself in all aspects of the business.
[24:55.420 --> 24:56.660]  That's what I'm going to try to say.
[24:56.660 --> 24:57.660]  Where am I now?
[24:57.660 --> 24:59.580]  Because I'm fucking way rambly again.
[24:59.580 --> 25:01.900]  Am I at a disadvantage by only knowing how to grow commercially?
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.180]  No, that's what your goal is.
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.580]  I just honestly want to know where I'm at.
[25:05.580 --> 25:11.300]  Should I write it out with this company or should I not venture it out with them and
[25:11.300 --> 25:14.140]  have them as my competition?
[25:14.140 --> 25:15.660]  Don't ever worry about competition.
[25:15.900 --> 25:18.460]  In business, there are always going to be other businesses.
[25:18.460 --> 25:19.780]  That is how business works.
[25:19.780 --> 25:21.540]  Without competition, you will fail.
[25:21.540 --> 25:22.860]  You'll be the only one.
[25:22.860 --> 25:24.340]  Your ego will get too big.
[25:24.340 --> 25:25.420]  You'll run out of product.
[25:25.420 --> 25:27.220]  Something will go wrong if you're the only one.
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.420]  Have a little competition.
[25:28.420 --> 25:29.420]  That's healthy.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.300]  But I can't tell you where to stay.
[25:31.300 --> 25:35.180]  I can't tell you if you want to stay in the facility in which you're working with now
[25:35.180 --> 25:39.180]  or if you want to step out to another facility and take the reins and have that much more
[25:39.180 --> 25:41.940]  control, also that much more responsibility.
[25:41.940 --> 25:45.220]  You're going to have to learn how to juggle that in your own life where that fits in for
[25:45.780 --> 25:48.780]  But don't go in thinking that anybody is your competition.
[25:48.780 --> 25:50.180]  Don't make an enemy mindset.
[25:50.180 --> 25:51.980]  Don't make a battlefield mindset.
[25:51.980 --> 25:53.620]  We are the cannabis community.
[25:53.620 --> 25:54.900]  You may be different businesses.
[25:54.900 --> 25:57.980]  You may be doing things differently, but we all have the same goal.
[25:57.980 --> 26:02.820]  So even if you do end up on the other team, we are all headed to the top of Mount Everest.
[26:02.820 --> 26:06.100]  Mountain climbers aren't competing against anybody but themselves, even though there
[26:06.100 --> 26:07.700]  are other climbers out there.
[26:07.700 --> 26:10.260]  They don't give a shit what the other climbers are doing.
[26:10.260 --> 26:11.380]  They just want to get to the top.
[26:11.380 --> 26:14.700]  If another climber falls, they're going to help, but they're not worried about, oh, that
[26:14.700 --> 26:17.340]  climber is going up the mountain more quickly than me.
[26:17.340 --> 26:19.700]  They just say, I'm going to get to the top when I get there.
[26:19.700 --> 26:21.060]  So you do that for you.
[26:21.060 --> 26:22.340]  Don't worry about the other climbers.
[26:22.340 --> 26:23.340]  You do your fucking thing.
[26:23.340 --> 26:25.500]  And that goes for just about everything in life.
[26:25.500 --> 26:29.420]  Don't compete with anybody but yourself because you are your only gauge of your own success.
[26:29.420 --> 26:30.940]  And who knows what the other people have going.
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.700]  They may look like they're winning the race, but they may have shit their pants.
[26:33.700 --> 26:36.460]  And if they win the race with shit in their pants, they still lost.
[26:36.460 --> 26:39.620]  So if you didn't shit your pants and you win the race second place, you win.
[26:39.620 --> 26:44.220]  So don't judge your success by anybody else's success just because they're doing something
[26:44.220 --> 26:46.700]  differently doesn't mean they're winning.
[26:46.700 --> 26:48.540]  I'm going to try to get back on track here.
[26:48.540 --> 26:49.540]  All right.
[26:49.540 --> 26:51.740]  This person is wondering if they should branch out.
[26:51.740 --> 26:55.820]  And then they want to know, is my knowledge that I know now enough to have my own little
[26:55.820 --> 26:57.540]  successful shop in the future?
[26:57.540 --> 26:59.120]  I don't know exactly what you know.
[26:59.120 --> 27:02.940]  From the size of the grow, you said you were running, you've got multiple rooms that are
[27:02.940 --> 27:04.140]  a good size.
[27:04.140 --> 27:05.980]  You've got quite a few plants in there.
[27:05.980 --> 27:08.620]  You were running, with this math, you're running close to 2000 plants.
[27:08.620 --> 27:10.820]  I don't know how many people you have helping you.
[27:10.820 --> 27:14.700]  I don't know if this is a multi-person facility or a one-man show.
[27:14.700 --> 27:20.220]  If you're doing that on yourself, on your own, I would rely on you to be a quality lead
[27:20.220 --> 27:21.220]  cultivator.
[27:21.220 --> 27:22.620]  You could probably lead a team.
[27:22.620 --> 27:25.100]  You could certainly manage a decent size facility.
[27:25.100 --> 27:26.720]  You can do whatever you need to do.
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.620]  If the things you were telling me are accurate, if you're pulling 80 to 90 pounds at 18 lights,
[27:31.620 --> 27:35.420]  you're doing better than most professional cultivators in a lot of facilities that have
[27:35.420 --> 27:36.980]  been around for quite a while.
[27:36.980 --> 27:40.540]  I don't want to boost up your ego because I have not seen the quality of the product.
[27:41.260 --> 27:42.260]  You've got to pass lab testing.
[27:42.260 --> 27:46.220]  Do you understand pesticide applications and pesticide safety?
[27:46.220 --> 27:47.900]  Are you compliant?
[27:47.900 --> 27:51.580]  There are a lot of other things to think about, but that is all legal stuff that is going
[27:51.580 --> 27:55.940]  to happen to you if you choose to work with your own company or stay with the folks you're
[27:55.940 --> 27:56.940]  working with now.
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.060]  I'm not sure what to tell you.
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.940]  I can't make business decisions for you, my friend.
[28:00.940 --> 28:04.620]  He says, my family has always frowned upon cannabis, and I want to make the difference
[28:04.620 --> 28:09.660]  and prove them wrong that I can be a successful young man while cultivating cannabis.
[28:09.780 --> 28:15.860]  I admire your passion that you want to be a successful cannabis cultivator, but let's
[28:15.860 --> 28:19.100]  not do something just to prove somebody wrong.
[28:19.100 --> 28:22.820]  Prove yourself, prove your passion is what you should be doing.
[28:22.820 --> 28:27.660]  Do what you want to do to make your life happy for yourself, not to prove anybody else wrong.
[28:27.660 --> 28:31.460]  That's a big waste of time because they're not spending their energy proving you wrong
[28:31.460 --> 28:32.460]  on shit.
[28:32.460 --> 28:33.460]  They don't care.
[28:33.460 --> 28:34.460]  They've moved on.
[28:34.460 --> 28:37.260]  So don't waste your energy doing something to prove anybody wrong.
[28:37.260 --> 28:40.340]  Do what you're doing to show what you are passionate about.
[28:40.340 --> 28:43.620]  Prove it to yourself that you can do what you set your mind and heart to do.
[28:43.620 --> 28:46.080]  So set some goals and reach those goals.
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.140]  He wraps up the message by saying, I respect your craft immensely, and I am very eager
[28:50.140 --> 28:52.460]  to hear what you have to say.
[28:52.460 --> 28:56.900]  I really gave some weird advice because I can't tell you what to do with your personal
[28:56.900 --> 28:59.940]  life and with your business life and with your career.
[28:59.940 --> 29:01.660]  I don't know what the options are.
[29:01.660 --> 29:03.940]  I only see a couple of words on paper.
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.660]  I can't see the long-term effects that this will have on your life.
[29:07.660 --> 29:11.460]  I would make sort of a flow chart, and this may sound silly for some people, but this
[29:11.460 --> 29:13.900]  is what successful people will do.
[29:13.900 --> 29:19.260]  Draw a chart and say, if I choose decision A, what will my life be like in one week,
[29:19.260 --> 29:24.500]  two weeks, six weeks, two months, three months, six months?
[29:24.500 --> 29:28.740]  What will my life be like one year from today if I make decision A?
[29:28.740 --> 29:32.900]  What will my life be like in two years, three years, five years, 10 years?
[29:32.900 --> 29:37.780]  Think about what your life will be like in a certain amount of time from decision A.
[29:37.780 --> 29:42.700]  Then do the same damn thing for decision B. What is best for you and what is best for
[29:42.700 --> 29:45.340]  your family and what is what you really want?
[29:45.340 --> 29:47.020]  You don't have to decide right now.
[29:47.020 --> 29:50.400]  Hopefully, you've got a few minutes to sit back and think about it.
[29:50.400 --> 29:51.400]  Do whatever you do.
[29:51.400 --> 29:52.400]  Get a clear head.
[29:52.400 --> 29:54.260]  Get a really clear head and think about it.
[29:54.260 --> 29:57.220]  Then put in your head whatever you like to put in your head and think about it.
[29:57.220 --> 29:59.140]  If you want to smoke a fatty, smoke a fatty.
[29:59.140 --> 30:00.900]  If you want to drink a beer, drink a beer.
[30:00.900 --> 30:05.700]  If you want to eat some mushrooms, eat those damn mushrooms and think this decision through.
[30:05.700 --> 30:09.020]  Then clear your head again and make a solid decision when you got a clear head.
[30:09.020 --> 30:12.540]  So you think about it completely sober, then you get fucking wacky out of your brain and
[30:12.540 --> 30:13.980]  think about it real good.
[30:13.980 --> 30:17.940]  Sleep on it for a couple nights, come back to it nice and crispy, make a good decision.
[30:17.940 --> 30:18.940]  Just think about it.
[30:18.940 --> 30:22.140]  I can't tell you what to do with your life, but I really wish that I could.
[30:22.140 --> 30:26.780]  It is exciting to team up with investors and create your own business.
[30:26.780 --> 30:29.980]  You are attaching your entire life to that business.
[30:30.060 --> 30:32.100]  You will wake up and be that business.
[30:32.100 --> 30:33.980]  You will fall asleep being that business.
[30:33.980 --> 30:37.180]  You are responsible for a lot of things.
[30:37.180 --> 30:42.220]  You are basically having another child if you start this business with other people.
[30:42.220 --> 30:46.260]  If you are working with a company that is established, that has owners, that has people
[30:46.260 --> 30:50.060]  that handle that part, you have a lot of the stress taken off your back.
[30:50.060 --> 30:53.060]  Also, you have a lot of the paycheck taken off your back.
[30:53.060 --> 30:56.860]  You have a lot of the pride and a lot of the say-so taken off of your back.
[30:56.860 --> 30:59.100]  So you have to decide what makes you happiest.
[30:59.220 --> 31:04.220]  I really don't want to make a personal or a career decision for one of my friends.
[31:04.220 --> 31:07.220]  I want to give you words of encouragement and make you think about it.
[31:07.220 --> 31:11.220]  I want to hope that you make the best decision for yourself and for your family.
[31:11.220 --> 31:15.220]  I also want to thank you for listening to the show because you have been a longtime listener.
[31:15.220 --> 31:18.220]  We have been emailing back and forth for quite some time.
[31:18.220 --> 31:22.220]  You sent me this email a little bit back, so I hope I'm not too late with the reply.
[31:22.220 --> 31:26.220]  But I do appreciate the support and I do know that you help me out on the Patreon channel.
[31:26.340 --> 31:29.340]  So I want to give you an extra fist bump and an extra thank you for that.
[31:29.340 --> 31:32.340]  And just be confident that you will make the correct decision.
[31:32.340 --> 31:38.340]  And one thing I just thought of is this cannabis industry is ever-changing and ever-evolving.
[31:38.340 --> 31:42.340]  You are a passionate and an educated cannabis grower.
[31:42.340 --> 31:47.340]  And you are always going to have some sort of a spot in the commercial cultivation industry
[31:47.340 --> 31:49.340]  if you choose to do so.
[31:49.340 --> 31:52.340]  I am a very qualified commercial grower.
[31:52.460 --> 32:00.460]  And I don't spend a long time in the same facility because things rotate in this industry so drastically.
[32:00.460 --> 32:04.460]  So if you are a skilled cultivator and you can present yourself well,
[32:04.460 --> 32:07.460]  if you can write a resume, if you can interview well,
[32:07.460 --> 32:12.460]  you will never be without a job in the commercial cultivation industry.
[32:12.460 --> 32:18.460]  If you decide that you don't like the way a facility is ran or that an owner is implementing a new rule
[32:18.580 --> 32:22.580]  or maybe an investor is being cheap and not buying the appropriate equipment,
[32:22.580 --> 32:26.580]  you can leave that facility and find employment at another facility
[32:26.580 --> 32:30.580]  in a very short amount of time once the industry is established.
[32:30.580 --> 32:35.580]  It is actually very easy when the industry is new because everybody needs a qualified grower.
[32:35.580 --> 32:38.580]  So don't be too afraid to jump in somewhere,
[32:38.580 --> 32:42.580]  do what you need to do for a little while, learn that style.
[32:42.580 --> 32:45.580]  Every facility does something different just because that's how they do it.
[32:45.700 --> 32:48.700]  They've got a lead cultivator that set it up with an idea
[32:48.700 --> 32:52.700]  or they've got an owner that set it up with an idea and you've got to adapt to that.
[32:52.700 --> 32:54.700]  So you will learn things in every facility.
[32:54.700 --> 32:58.700]  So don't be afraid to leave something for something better.
[32:58.700 --> 33:01.700]  But if you are stable and secure and you need to take care of a family,
[33:01.700 --> 33:03.700]  always keep that in mind as well.
[33:03.700 --> 33:04.700]  But don't be afraid.
[33:04.700 --> 33:07.700]  There are jobs in the commercial cultivation industry.
[33:07.700 --> 33:10.700]  And when one ends, there's always another one available.
[33:10.820 --> 33:16.820]  Just be careful of your reputation because the community does get quite small quite quickly.
[33:16.820 --> 33:19.820]  We all know each other in this cannabis industry.
[33:19.820 --> 33:25.820]  Colorado is a giant state, but I know folks from Fort Collins down to Trinidad.
[33:25.820 --> 33:27.820]  And that is each end of our state from north to south.
[33:27.820 --> 33:30.820]  I could get in the car and drive to every city and get out of the car
[33:30.820 --> 33:33.820]  and walk into a dispensary and high five a friend.
[33:33.820 --> 33:35.820]  I'm not trying to toot my horn and say I know a lot of people.
[33:35.820 --> 33:37.820]  That is everybody in Colorado.
[33:37.940 --> 33:40.940]  We all know if you're in the industry, we all basically know each other.
[33:40.940 --> 33:44.940]  There are industry nights, there's bud tender nights, there's cultivator night.
[33:44.940 --> 33:48.940]  There are all kinds of events that keep us all connected.
[33:48.940 --> 33:52.940]  And just like any other industry, we are a bunch of gossipy bitches.
[33:52.940 --> 33:55.940]  So keep your reputation clean, do a good job,
[33:55.940 --> 33:58.940]  keep your passion up, keep your education sharp,
[33:58.940 --> 34:01.940]  keep learning, keep evolving, stay on top of the equipment,
[34:01.940 --> 34:05.940]  stay on top of the methods, stay on top of the pesticide rules,
[34:06.060 --> 34:09.060]  stay advanced, stay ever evolving.
[34:09.060 --> 34:12.060]  And as long as you don't tarnish your reputation and cause a major problem
[34:12.060 --> 34:15.060]  and people in the industry aren't blaming you for a major failure
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.060]  or a bunch of fuck-ups somewhere,
[34:17.060 --> 34:20.060]  you should always have gainful employment in the cannabis industry
[34:20.060 --> 34:22.060]  if you choose to do so.
[34:22.060 --> 34:25.060]  So there may not have been a lot of direct advice for this situation,
[34:25.060 --> 34:29.060]  but I hope I gave a lot of useful life advice for you, my friend.
[34:29.060 --> 34:32.060]  I hope everything goes well for you down there in Florida.
[34:32.180 --> 34:36.180]  Please reach out and let me know that you heard this response on the podcast.
[34:36.180 --> 34:38.180]  I look forward to your email, my friend.
[34:38.180 --> 34:40.180]  Get back to me. I cannot wait.
[34:40.180 --> 34:43.180]  If anybody else out there has a cultivation question,
[34:43.180 --> 34:46.180]  a cannabis culture question, or they just want to reach out and say hello,
[34:46.180 --> 34:49.180]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[34:49.180 --> 34:52.180]  and you know I look forward to hearing from you.
[34:52.180 --> 34:54.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do have another email here in front of me.
[34:54.180 --> 34:56.180]  Let's get right to it.
[34:56.180 --> 34:57.180]  This one says,
[34:57.180 --> 34:58.180]  Hey Rasta Jeff,
[34:58.180 --> 35:01.180]  First of all, thanks for the podcast content which you were providing.
[35:01.300 --> 35:03.300]  It is truly appreciated and helpful.
[35:03.300 --> 35:05.300]  Hey, you are very welcome.
[35:05.300 --> 35:06.300]  Thank you for saying thanks.
[35:06.300 --> 35:09.300]  That is like a big recharge and that means a lot to me.
[35:09.300 --> 35:10.300]  So we're going to keep moving.
[35:10.300 --> 35:11.300]  It says,
[35:11.300 --> 35:14.300]  I listen to the show every day while working and I have learned so much.
[35:14.300 --> 35:15.300]  Perfect.
[35:15.300 --> 35:16.300]  I'm hitting my goal.
[35:16.300 --> 35:18.300]  I want to teach people, so I'm doing it right.
[35:18.300 --> 35:19.300]  It says,
[35:19.300 --> 35:20.300]  English is not my native language,
[35:20.300 --> 35:24.300]  so excuse me in advance if you have a hard time reading this.
[35:24.300 --> 35:29.300]  Man, big compliments because so far your English is better than most Americans.
[35:29.420 --> 35:30.420]  So congratulations.
[35:30.420 --> 35:31.420]  Good job there.
[35:31.420 --> 35:32.420]  It goes on to say,
[35:32.420 --> 35:38.420]  I am on my first grow using LED lighting and a grow tent that is in my room in my apartment.
[35:38.420 --> 35:42.420]  The tent is 23 inches by 23 inches by 60 inches.
[35:42.420 --> 35:45.420]  So we've got about two feet by two feet by five feet.
[35:45.420 --> 35:47.420]  It goes on to say,
[35:47.420 --> 35:49.420]  I am concerned about light leaks.
[35:49.420 --> 35:54.420]  I have listened to your podcast and I know light leaks are something to be careful about.
[35:54.420 --> 35:57.420]  I also know that a tent needs good ventilation.
[35:57.540 --> 35:59.540]  Both of these things are correct.
[35:59.540 --> 36:01.540]  When we have our plants in their dark period,
[36:01.540 --> 36:06.540]  we need to keep the dark period uninterrupted and that means zero light.
[36:06.540 --> 36:08.540]  If there is any light on that plant,
[36:08.540 --> 36:09.540]  you are going to have problems.
[36:09.540 --> 36:11.540]  That will give you potential hermaphrodites,
[36:11.540 --> 36:13.540]  which will mess up your crop.
[36:13.540 --> 36:14.540]  That is undesirable.
[36:14.540 --> 36:16.540]  So we want zero light,
[36:16.540 --> 36:18.540]  absolutely zero light.
[36:18.540 --> 36:19.540]  When people say,
[36:19.540 --> 36:20.540]  is this too much light?
[36:20.540 --> 36:21.540]  Yes.
[36:21.540 --> 36:22.540]  Any light,
[36:22.540 --> 36:23.540]  too much,
[36:23.540 --> 36:24.540]  zero light.
[36:24.540 --> 36:25.540]  I mean,
[36:25.540 --> 36:26.540]  zero.
[36:26.660 --> 36:29.660]  You can't put your hand directly in front of your face and not be able to see your hand.
[36:29.660 --> 36:31.660]  I want you to wait for like 10 minutes.
[36:31.660 --> 36:33.660]  I want your eyes to adjust.
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.660]  I want you to look around and look for little leaks.
[36:35.660 --> 36:38.660]  Are there any little prickles in the material where lights come in?
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.660]  We cannot have any light.
[36:40.660 --> 36:41.660]  So this is absolutely correct.
[36:41.660 --> 36:42.660]  Zero light leaks.
[36:42.660 --> 36:45.660]  That is an absolute thing to be concerned about.
[36:45.660 --> 36:49.660]  This person also said that they need correct ventilation,
[36:49.660 --> 36:50.660]  which is absolutely correct.
[36:50.660 --> 36:53.660]  So they have been listening to the show and I am proud of them so far.
[36:53.660 --> 36:55.660]  So let's keep moving.
[36:55.780 --> 36:56.780]  This person says,
[36:56.780 --> 37:00.780]  right now my seedlings are getting fresh air from the bottom of my tent,
[37:00.780 --> 37:05.780]  which has the classic duct holes in and out for aeration.
[37:05.780 --> 37:07.780]  I simply put a fan in front of the hole.
[37:07.780 --> 37:10.780]  So we're just blowing air straight into the little mesh right there,
[37:10.780 --> 37:11.780]  which works beautifully.
[37:11.780 --> 37:15.780]  That mesh is going to slow down the wind so it doesn't disturb the seedlings too much.
[37:15.780 --> 37:17.780]  And we're going to get some air exchange.
[37:17.780 --> 37:19.780]  So far we're off to a good start.
[37:19.780 --> 37:21.780]  The message goes on to say,
[37:21.780 --> 37:22.780]  but when it's time for flowering,
[37:22.780 --> 37:24.780]  I'm going to have to shut down this vent
[37:24.900 --> 37:28.900]  so the light won't come in because my tent is in a room which can be
[37:28.900 --> 37:32.900]  illuminated sometimes because I store things in this room.
[37:32.900 --> 37:34.900]  That is a common problem.
[37:34.900 --> 37:37.900]  We do have our grow tents in rooms where we have to frequently turn off the
[37:37.900 --> 37:39.900]  regular light in the room.
[37:39.900 --> 37:41.900]  It also goes on to say,
[37:41.900 --> 37:43.900]  what about fresh air?
[37:43.900 --> 37:44.900]  So he's got to close up the vents,
[37:44.900 --> 37:47.900]  but they are now concerned about fresh air because they don't want light
[37:47.900 --> 37:49.900]  coming in through that bottom flap.
[37:49.900 --> 37:50.900]  It says,
[37:50.900 --> 37:53.900]  how is the fresh air going to enter the tent?
[37:54.020 --> 37:56.020]  This may sound like an ultimate noob question,
[37:56.020 --> 37:59.020]  but I really do not know how to solve this.
[37:59.020 --> 38:00.020]  Then it goes on with,
[38:00.020 --> 38:04.020]  maybe is it possible in a small tent like this that I don't use a fan?
[38:04.020 --> 38:05.020]  By the way,
[38:05.020 --> 38:08.020]  I plan to grow two plants and I want to keep them pretty small.
[38:08.020 --> 38:13.020]  I do not care at all about having a huge yield with great taste or shit.
[38:13.020 --> 38:15.020]  I actually do not smoke,
[38:15.020 --> 38:20.020]  but I want to grow some high CBD plants with my very occasional migraines.
[38:20.020 --> 38:21.020]  Okay.
[38:21.020 --> 38:23.020]  So we're growing CBD plants to help with migraines.
[38:23.140 --> 38:28.140]  And also just growing because I love the plant and I love growing outdoors or
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.140]  indoors,
[38:29.140 --> 38:30.140]  excuse me.
[38:30.140 --> 38:33.140]  So this person is just growing basically for the passion of growing.
[38:33.140 --> 38:36.140]  This could just be an act of civil disobedience if they are in an illegal
[38:36.140 --> 38:37.140]  place,
[38:37.140 --> 38:38.140]  which I would definitely admire.
[38:38.140 --> 38:41.140]  There's more than we're going to wrap it up and we'll answer the question.
[38:41.140 --> 38:42.140]  I hope I made myself clear.
[38:42.140 --> 38:46.140]  Actually listening to your podcast helps also a lot in learning English.
[38:46.140 --> 38:47.140]  Hey,
[38:47.140 --> 38:48.140]  that is great.
[38:48.140 --> 38:49.140]  Your English is beautiful.
[38:49.140 --> 38:51.140]  You did a wonderful job.
[38:51.260 --> 38:54.260]  You did better than most Americans do with their emails.
[38:54.260 --> 38:56.260]  Your message was very easy to read.
[38:56.260 --> 39:00.260]  I really like the idea that I am helping you learn English.
[39:00.260 --> 39:03.260]  I like to think that I speak fairly well for a lazy American.
[39:03.260 --> 39:04.260]  So thank you.
[39:04.260 --> 39:06.260]  I hope you're learning well from me.
[39:06.260 --> 39:08.260]  He wraps it up with cheers from France.
[39:08.260 --> 39:09.260]  Also,
[39:09.260 --> 39:10.260]  I may be a bit paranoid,
[39:10.260 --> 39:13.260]  so please do not use my name because weed consumption and cultivation are
[39:13.260 --> 39:15.260]  highly prohibited here.
[39:15.260 --> 39:17.260]  So I won't say your name at all,
[39:17.260 --> 39:20.260]  but big thank you for the email and big thank you and fist bump for your
[39:20.380 --> 39:25.380]  act of civil disobedience by illegally cultivating your medicine there in
[39:25.380 --> 39:27.380]  the great country of France.
[39:27.380 --> 39:32.380]  So let's talk a little bit about now how to get air into that tent once we
[39:32.380 --> 39:35.380]  need to close that vent so the light does not come in.
[39:35.380 --> 39:37.380]  There are a couple of simple solutions.
[39:37.380 --> 39:42.380]  I would definitely recommend some sort of an extraction fan on the top of
[39:42.380 --> 39:46.380]  that tent to remove the heat and humidity from the tent.
[39:46.380 --> 39:48.380]  We need a way to get that old air out.
[39:48.500 --> 39:51.500]  And the general way to do that is to put an extraction fan at the top.
[39:51.500 --> 39:55.500]  There is probably a hole or a duct or a port on the top of that tent.
[39:55.500 --> 40:00.500]  So I would put a blower up there sucking air out and it would just pull the
[40:00.500 --> 40:04.500]  hot air out of that little tent and it would just dump it into that room
[40:04.500 --> 40:07.500]  into the bedroom or into the storage room where you've got the tent.
[40:07.500 --> 40:12.500]  Now as that fan or that blower pulls air up to the top of that tent and
[40:12.500 --> 40:13.500]  out of the top of the tent,
[40:13.500 --> 40:16.500]  it is going to need to replace that old air.
[40:16.620 --> 40:18.620]  It is going to need to replace the air somewhere.
[40:18.620 --> 40:20.620]  That air will need to come from somewhere.
[40:20.620 --> 40:23.620]  The tent will crush in a little bit.
[40:23.620 --> 40:24.620]  That is okay.
[40:24.620 --> 40:26.620]  That negative pressure is not a problem.
[40:26.620 --> 40:28.620]  I've talked about this in another episode.
[40:28.620 --> 40:30.620]  The tent will cave in just a little bit.
[40:30.620 --> 40:31.620]  That is okay.
[40:31.620 --> 40:33.620]  Once the pressure gets strong enough,
[40:33.620 --> 40:36.620]  the air will start flowing through the gaps in the tent.
[40:36.620 --> 40:37.620]  There are gaps in the zipper.
[40:37.620 --> 40:41.620]  There are gaps in little spots in the tent that the air will find its way
[40:41.620 --> 40:42.620]  through.
[40:42.620 --> 40:43.620]  So it will suck right through there.
[40:43.740 --> 40:46.740]  Also, you don't have to Velcro those flaps down completely tight.
[40:46.740 --> 40:49.740]  You can Velcro them down to where the light doesn't get through,
[40:49.740 --> 40:53.740]  but they can still be open enough to where the air can pass through there.
[40:53.740 --> 40:55.740]  So you don't need the fan blowing in.
[40:55.740 --> 40:57.740]  I would put a fan sucking out.
[40:57.740 --> 41:02.740]  That fan will remove your humidity and that fan will also remove excess
[41:02.740 --> 41:06.740]  heat and that fan at the same time will help draw air in through that
[41:06.740 --> 41:10.740]  passive vent on the bottom and keep recycling and refreshing the air
[41:10.740 --> 41:11.740]  in the tent.
[41:11.860 --> 41:12.860]  Now keep in mind,
[41:12.860 --> 41:16.860]  you can only refresh it with the air that is available in that storage room.
[41:16.860 --> 41:19.860]  So I don't know how often that air gets exchanged.
[41:19.860 --> 41:21.860]  I don't know how large that room is.
[41:21.860 --> 41:23.860]  It must be decent because you're growing in there.
[41:23.860 --> 41:27.860]  But keep in mind that that room is what is supplying your grow tent with
[41:27.860 --> 41:30.860]  all of its environmental and atmospheric conditions.
[41:30.860 --> 41:34.860]  Your CO2, your oxygen, your temperature, your humidity,
[41:34.860 --> 41:36.860]  they're all coming from that room.
[41:36.860 --> 41:40.860]  So that is going to have a lot to do with the climate inside of that tent.
[41:40.980 --> 41:42.980]  So you do need to worry about the light leaks.
[41:42.980 --> 41:46.980]  But I think if you just let the flap down and Velcro it at the corners,
[41:46.980 --> 41:48.980]  but don't do it all the way across the bottom,
[41:48.980 --> 41:51.980]  then put an extraction fan at the top,
[41:51.980 --> 41:54.980]  maybe a four inch fan, a four inch blower,
[41:54.980 --> 41:57.980]  like a squirrel cage blower or a four inch.
[41:57.980 --> 41:59.980]  It's just an extraction fan to go at the top,
[41:59.980 --> 42:00.980]  set that in there.
[42:00.980 --> 42:01.980]  You can just set it right on top.
[42:01.980 --> 42:03.980]  It probably doesn't weigh too much.
[42:03.980 --> 42:05.980]  It'll just set right on top and rest there.
[42:05.980 --> 42:07.980]  Make it to where it is sucking air out.
[42:07.980 --> 42:09.980]  And that's going to dump the air into your storage area.
[42:10.100 --> 42:13.100]  But that will also make the air flow through that tent.
[42:13.100 --> 42:15.100]  It'll come right through the passive vents in the bottom.
[42:15.100 --> 42:17.100]  It will also come through the gaps in the zipper,
[42:17.100 --> 42:19.100]  through any gaps in the stitching.
[42:19.100 --> 42:21.100]  It'll go right up out of the top.
[42:21.100 --> 42:23.100]  And then it'll just recycle into the room.
[42:23.100 --> 42:26.100]  Now I would try to keep the lights on minimally in that room.
[42:26.100 --> 42:29.100]  I understand that you have to visit that room to get things.
[42:29.100 --> 42:31.100]  You say here that it's used as a storage room.
[42:31.100 --> 42:33.100]  You're going to have to get in there occasionally.
[42:33.100 --> 42:36.100]  Maybe try to plan your lights off schedule
[42:36.100 --> 42:38.100]  around times when you're sleeping
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.220]  or times that you won't have to visit that room.
[42:40.220 --> 42:44.220]  Try to think about what hours of the day do I go into that room?
[42:44.220 --> 42:46.220]  I wake up at this time of day.
[42:46.220 --> 42:48.220]  I go to bed at this time of day.
[42:48.220 --> 42:50.220]  So that's only, it's probably 16 hours of the day.
[42:50.220 --> 42:52.220]  You're probably sleeping eight hours.
[42:52.220 --> 42:54.220]  So we only got to think about four hours
[42:54.220 --> 42:56.220]  that we don't want to go in there.
[42:56.220 --> 42:58.220]  Maybe cut four hours at this end of the day
[42:58.220 --> 43:00.220]  or four hours at this end of the day
[43:00.220 --> 43:02.220]  and time it around that to where you don't have to interrupt that room.
[43:02.220 --> 43:04.220]  That's part of being a grower.
[43:04.220 --> 43:06.220]  We have to plan around that stuff.
[43:06.340 --> 43:08.340]  Plan your lights off time around times
[43:08.340 --> 43:10.340]  that you won't have to turn on that light.
[43:10.340 --> 43:12.340]  Also, most of the time those tents are well enough made
[43:12.340 --> 43:14.340]  where we won't get much light leakage.
[43:14.340 --> 43:16.340]  A good way to see if you are getting a light leak
[43:16.340 --> 43:18.340]  is to turn off the lights in your storage room.
[43:18.340 --> 43:20.340]  Turn on the lights in the grow tent.
[43:20.340 --> 43:22.340]  Seal the tent up like normal
[43:22.340 --> 43:24.340]  and just hang out for a few minutes
[43:24.340 --> 43:26.340]  in that dark room
[43:26.340 --> 43:28.340]  and see if any little pricks of light
[43:28.340 --> 43:30.340]  come shining out.
[43:30.340 --> 43:32.340]  If you can see little dots of light,
[43:32.340 --> 43:34.340]  you may need to put a piece of duct tape
[43:34.460 --> 43:36.460]  around that just to stop light from going the other way.
[43:36.460 --> 43:38.460]  Also, keep in mind
[43:38.460 --> 43:40.460]  the light in your storage area
[43:40.460 --> 43:42.460]  is nowhere near as bright
[43:42.460 --> 43:44.460]  as the light inside of your grow space.
[43:44.460 --> 43:46.460]  If it's making it out,
[43:46.460 --> 43:48.460]  it still may not be making it in
[43:48.460 --> 43:50.460]  because that light is nowhere near as intense.
[43:50.460 --> 43:52.460]  It sounds like the main solution
[43:52.460 --> 43:54.460]  is going to be putting a small blower
[43:54.460 --> 43:56.460]  at the top of the tent.
[43:56.460 --> 43:58.460]  That way we can suck air out
[43:58.460 --> 44:00.460]  and at the same time pull air in
[44:00.460 --> 44:02.460]  and also try to adjust our lighting,
[44:02.580 --> 44:04.580]  so we don't cause any problems.
[44:04.580 --> 44:06.580]  I understand sometimes that's a struggle,
[44:06.580 --> 44:08.580]  but the tent should be well-made enough
[44:08.580 --> 44:10.580]  to where we don't get light leaks.
[44:10.580 --> 44:12.580]  If not, then we can use some duct tape
[44:12.580 --> 44:14.580]  or something similar to plug up any light leaks.
[44:14.580 --> 44:16.580]  That way we don't get hermaphrodites.
[44:16.580 --> 44:18.580]  That way we don't ruin the garden.
[44:18.580 --> 44:20.580]  That way we can have a successful grow.
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think you can hear
[44:22.580 --> 44:24.580]  my throat burning out, so it is time
[44:24.580 --> 44:26.580]  to start wrapping up the show.

[45:47.100 --> 45:50.420]  Bread in the oven, bacon.

[46:18.600 --> 46:22.560]  Me finger no make you a devil free me gone.

[46:40.120 --> 46:43.080]  Bread in the oven, bacon.
[46:43.080 --> 46:46.040]  Here comes the rude boy, Jamaican.
[46:46.040 --> 46:48.840]  Remember early 1st of June?
[46:48.840 --> 46:53.160]  It was a Monday morning when they killed the General.
[46:53.160 --> 46:54.800]  Damn.
[46:54.800 --> 46:58.000]  And the Monday ballin'.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.760]  Kingston 12th, Trenchtown.
[47:00.760 --> 47:03.840]  Cookie politics and calm down.
[47:03.840 --> 47:06.440]  When the police come, you run.
[47:06.440 --> 47:09.400]  They want shoot you down with gun.
[47:09.400 --> 47:12.400]  Bread in the oven, bacon.

[47:15.280 --> 47:18.200]  Bread in the oven, bacon.
[47:18.200 --> 47:21.520]  Here comes the rude boy, Jamaican.
[47:21.520 --> 47:23.960]  I met a rich Yankee.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  She couldn't do the reggae skanky.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.280]  Her papa was a police top ranking.
[47:30.280 --> 47:32.640]  And he not received.
[47:32.640 --> 47:35.360]  Police thought her, she must be mistaken.
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.920]  To hang with the crazy Jamaican.
[47:37.920 --> 47:41.960]  Come make me roll and me ruffle and me shaken.
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.280]  In the oven.
[47:43.280 --> 47:44.520]  Bang-dang-dang.
[47:44.520 --> 47:47.480]  Bread in the oven, bacon.
[47:47.480 --> 47:50.360]  Here comes the rude boy, Jamaican.
[47:50.360 --> 47:53.320]  Bread in the oven, bacon.
