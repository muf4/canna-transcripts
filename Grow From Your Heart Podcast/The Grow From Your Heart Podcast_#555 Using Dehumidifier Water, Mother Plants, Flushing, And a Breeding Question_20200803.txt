[03:06.690 --> 03:09.230]  Friends. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's not waste too much time
[03:09.470 --> 03:13.930]  Let's jump right into the patreon messages for today's episode
[03:13.930 --> 03:21.190]  The first patreon message comes from girls grow to big shout out to girls grow to the message goes like this
[03:21.710 --> 03:25.070]  That dabbing video was bomb as fuck man
[03:25.110 --> 03:28.530]  I'm pretty sure they are referring to the 710 episode
[03:28.530 --> 03:33.010]  I took a couple of dabs and shared my dabbing equipment showed you guys how to take a proper dab
[03:33.010 --> 03:35.070]  I did take a big fat chunky dab
[03:35.070 --> 03:36.590]  I got a lot of comments on that
[03:36.590 --> 03:40.790]  Couple of people said that dab would kill me that was more concentrate than I smoke in a month
[03:40.790 --> 03:45.270]  That was my week supply of dabs got a lot of great compliments. Thank you guys for watching that
[03:45.270 --> 03:48.390]  It goes on to say thank you for doing this. You are very welcome
[03:48.390 --> 03:52.910]  Thank you for enjoying and learning and thank you for the patreon contribution and thank you for the feedback
[03:53.550 --> 03:57.750]  It says I'm still new to this. So that video was really helpful
[03:58.190 --> 04:03.710]  The comment I got the most was that people got answers to questions. They were embarrassed to ask
[04:03.710 --> 04:06.150]  So people were taking dabs at places
[04:06.150 --> 04:10.710]  They weren't sure how to handle some equipment or maybe they were watching their friends take dabs somewhere and they wanted to join
[04:10.710 --> 04:14.710]  But they were intimidated or afraid by gear afraid of gear now
[04:14.710 --> 04:16.790]  They knew how to jump in because they watched me do it
[04:16.790 --> 04:20.390]  I showed him how to use the gear now, they're dabbing like a pro. They're right up to speed
[04:20.390 --> 04:21.750]  They're getting blazed with their friends
[04:21.750 --> 04:24.710]  This message goes on to say I can't wait to meet you someday
[04:24.950 --> 04:29.350]  Me too as soon as all of the restrictions are over and we're allowed to play with our friends again
[04:29.350 --> 04:31.350]  I cannot wait to meet you take some dabs
[04:31.350 --> 04:36.790]  Give you a big fat proper dab out of my rig from my concentrates get you so high you're uncomfortable
[04:36.790 --> 04:39.270]  It'll be a really good time. We'll get some food or something after that
[04:39.270 --> 04:46.550]  So you're not too blazed for too long. It wraps up with take it easy. Stay safe. Stay stoned, bro. Love from, Missouri
[04:46.950 --> 04:50.630]  A big shout out to all of my friends out there in Missouri, uh working in the new
[04:51.190 --> 04:55.110]  Medical and or recreational cannabis market. I'm not sure if it's medical or recreational
[04:55.110 --> 04:56.710]  I'm, pretty sure they went medical out there
[04:56.710 --> 05:04.070]  They do have cannabis in Missouri one of the last places I ever assumed imagined or thought would have any access to legal cannabis
[05:04.630 --> 05:07.270]  I'm impressed keep it up keep kicking ass down there
[05:07.350 --> 05:11.750]  And if you ever have any more questions, please reach out patreon is the best way to do it
[05:11.830 --> 05:16.470]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right into the patreon message portion of today's episode
[05:16.790 --> 05:22.470]  The first message from patreon came from our friend north north chirps. What up north good to hear from you again
[05:22.710 --> 05:27.850]  The message starts off a lot like this. It says what's up? My diggity dog motherfucker
[05:28.310 --> 05:33.190]  Uh, then he called me a bad motherfucker. Uh, dude, you listen to too much. Joey Diaz. Take a break, bro
[05:33.270 --> 05:36.630]  I'm, just kidding gotta love joey, but settle down it goes on to say
[05:37.190 --> 05:42.790]  Anyways for the pg version. I love you dog. What's up? I just had a grow hack question
[05:43.270 --> 05:48.250]  What works for me is I have a portable air conditioner with an insulated ventilation
[05:48.710 --> 05:52.170]  Going out of my tent with a fan and a dehumidifier
[05:52.790 --> 05:56.230]  And the portable air conditioner working against each other for humidity
[05:56.470 --> 06:01.210]  I found that the balance works in there and there's a lot of wastewater that comes from my dehumidifier
[06:02.230 --> 06:09.990]  Uh, the wastewater does not read on my ec. So can I recycle this water into my system? That is my question
[06:10.070 --> 06:15.990]  All right, so our friends got a system that's got a dehumidifier and an air conditioner in their room and they're finding that the
[06:16.610 --> 06:22.950]  Dehumidifier is creating a lot of condensation and it's gathering a lot of water. I've seen this happen a lot. That's very common
[06:23.190 --> 06:28.870]  It's pulling the air from the air the water from the air gathering it into a little container. You've got all this water
[06:29.430 --> 06:32.870]  This uh north north chirps is going to say this listener, but it's north north chirps
[06:32.870 --> 06:39.270]  We know who they are north wants to know if they can use that water if they can recycle it into their watering system
[06:39.990 --> 06:45.430]  And it's not measuring anything on the ec meter. You've put an ec meter and a ppm meter in there. It shows zero
[06:45.510 --> 06:47.430]  There's nothing in that water
[06:47.430 --> 06:52.070]  For now, I would say that that water is safe. But what could happen is
[06:52.550 --> 06:57.930]  Gunk and shit. I don't know exactly what but build up could build up in your dehumidifier
[06:58.550 --> 07:02.150]  Build up could build up gunk build up mildew calcium. Who knows?
[07:02.230 --> 07:07.370]  I don't know exactly what but random shit could build up inside the dehumidifier
[07:07.450 --> 07:10.090]  You could get things in the hoses. You can get things in the filters
[07:10.730 --> 07:17.370]  I'm sure you've had a water filter. I'm sure i'm sure you've seen what just basic water can do to filters and pipes
[07:17.370 --> 07:21.930]  It makes things really grody and really dirty. So that stuff will build up over time possibly
[07:22.490 --> 07:28.250]  I don't know what's in the air. I don't know what's in that humidity that you are getting into those filters into those parts
[07:28.730 --> 07:29.770]  so
[07:29.770 --> 07:36.090]  My advice would be you can use it probably but continue to test it make sure that it's always testing at zero
[07:36.490 --> 07:39.850]  Maybe don't use that water right away on all of your plants
[07:39.850 --> 07:44.250]  Maybe test it out on a couple of plants it is testing at zero now
[07:44.410 --> 07:47.930]  But like I said, maybe stuff will build up maybe gunk mold junk
[07:48.410 --> 07:52.410]  Dust who knows what's going to build up in the filters and what will build up in that thing?
[07:52.410 --> 07:56.330]  If you don't keep it super clean that water may have something in it in the future
[07:56.650 --> 08:00.170]  So at this point while the machine is new, yeah, you can probably get away with it
[08:00.170 --> 08:02.250]  But I don't know that I would do that in the future
[08:03.050 --> 08:06.970]  Uh, make sure it's clean that's my best advice that I can give you i've had uh,
[08:07.370 --> 08:12.890]  varying opinions from different expert growers on this a lot of us say go ahead and use it a lot of us are also
[08:12.970 --> 08:16.250]  Very paranoid that there could be other shit in there in the future
[08:16.650 --> 08:22.810]  So that's my uh, my final answer you can use it but pay attention keep testing it pay attention to the plants
[08:22.890 --> 08:24.170]  Maybe dilute it
[08:24.170 --> 08:29.770]  Maybe you do like 10 this water and 90 the other water that way you're kind of spreading it out but not wasting it
[08:30.170 --> 08:33.450]  Maybe use this water for cleaning or something like that. Maybe um,
[08:33.850 --> 08:39.690]  But I think you can use it as long as it stays clean and as long as over time your machine doesn't get dirty
[08:39.930 --> 08:46.650]  And get junk developing inside of their shit crap dust dirt grime goo, whatever can build up in their boogers
[08:46.650 --> 08:50.570]  It's air boogers, dude. It's machine boogers. You don't want that part going to your plants
[08:50.810 --> 08:53.530]  All right, so I think i've thoroughly discussed it everybody so far
[08:53.850 --> 08:55.850]  Let's keep moving with these patreon messages
[08:56.090 --> 09:00.730]  If anybody else out there has a question that was harder to say than it looked you'll catch on
[09:00.970 --> 09:03.290]  If anybody else out there has a question, I would love to hear from you
[09:03.370 --> 09:06.010]  The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[09:06.330 --> 09:11.130]  Of course the quickest way to get your email to the top of the list is to join the patreon campaign
[09:11.370 --> 09:15.130]  You'll find a tier there that gets your email your message right to the top of the list
[09:15.370 --> 09:21.290]  Contribute to that campaign campaign level then send me a message and I will read it on one of the next shows
[09:21.370 --> 09:25.550]  I'm trying to do two episodes every week. We may have to increase it to keep up with the incoming messages
[09:25.850 --> 09:28.810]  We'll see how that goes. Let me get myself back on track
[09:29.770 --> 09:34.010]  This message came from our friend easy. Oh five seven. What up easy? Good to see you, bro
[09:34.170 --> 09:35.690]  Hope you're doing well out there
[09:35.690 --> 09:42.510]  The message goes when you decide to keep a mother plant do you ever top pop crack twist or just grow it naturally?
[09:43.050 --> 09:44.890]  Uh, there are multiple parts to this question
[09:44.890 --> 09:51.450]  So i'll stop and handle this part a mother plant when i'm growing a mother plant it is mainly for preservation
[09:51.530 --> 09:56.410]  I don't have room for a lot of plants in production. So I don't need to produce a lot of clones
[09:56.730 --> 10:02.170]  So I keep a very small mother plant and I try to keep them growing very slow. Just keep them alive
[10:02.250 --> 10:05.550]  I don't need them doing too much. I don't need them racing. I don't need them too excited
[10:06.330 --> 10:08.330]  I do top them because
[10:08.810 --> 10:12.410]  I don't need that one big top bud touching the light. I top them make a little canopy
[10:13.130 --> 10:15.930]  And get a nice little bush going on so I will top it
[10:16.650 --> 10:21.530]  But then as it grows i'm taking bud branches from the top to keep that branching going
[10:22.470 --> 10:28.730]  Oftentimes my mother plants become my flower plants. Also, they become a mother plant. I get a few clones
[10:28.730 --> 10:30.010]  I shape them the way that I want them
[10:30.010 --> 10:31.130]  I keep them for a while
[10:31.130 --> 10:35.930]  Then once they're big and they're shaped the way that I want I take a couple clones off of that those new clones
[10:36.170 --> 10:39.610]  Then become my future mother plant and that big plant that's been getting worked on
[10:39.850 --> 10:42.990]  Goes in the room and gets worked with it either gets flowered out or pollinated
[10:43.710 --> 10:48.030]  But I need small mother plants if i'm just keeping a plant for preservation as a mother plant
[10:48.110 --> 10:52.030]  I don't require a lot of clones. I don't require a lot of production from my moms
[10:52.350 --> 10:54.990]  So I keep them small. I keep them under minimal light
[10:54.990 --> 10:58.430]  They're not even under a whole bunch of light just enough to keep them going keep them alive
[10:58.750 --> 11:04.910]  Uh, keep them on a 19-5 cycle. I do not really pop crack or twist my mother plants
[11:04.910 --> 11:08.430]  I just let them grow naturally take the top out so that they start bushing out
[11:08.430 --> 11:12.430]  That's my first clone that first clone right off the top. That's my next production
[11:12.670 --> 11:17.230]  I run that this one veggies for a while gives me a couple clones. Then I flower that one generally
[11:17.550 --> 11:23.630]  So not too much work on the mother plants unless they're being groomed and trained and manipulated to be future flower plants
[11:24.030 --> 11:25.390]  So there's another part to the question
[11:25.390 --> 11:30.830]  It says in your experience, how long does it take a plant like lemon jeffery to go from 20 to 30 percent?
[11:30.910 --> 11:33.150]  perfect trichomes to overripe
[11:33.790 --> 11:37.630]  Um, you picked a very specific plant. You said lemon jeffery most plants
[11:37.630 --> 11:41.390]  I'm gonna say that's a window of 7 to 10, maybe 7 to 14 days
[11:41.870 --> 11:42.590]  when
[11:42.590 --> 11:44.910]  So there's like a 3 to 5 day period when they're perfect
[11:44.990 --> 11:47.790]  You're like, oh tomorrow will be just the right day and you look and they're perfect
[11:47.950 --> 11:53.550]  Then you got like 3 to 5 days of perfection then about I don't know 7 10 14 days
[11:53.550 --> 11:57.790]  Then you start going. Oops. I probably should have cut those down a couple days ago. Maybe a week ago. So
[11:59.070 --> 12:04.030]  It's about a week of a week window of prime cut down time and then by day 7 you're going
[12:04.110 --> 12:08.350]  Oh, they're starting to get a little more amber by day 10. You're like, that's a lot of amber by 14
[12:08.350 --> 12:10.350]  You're like, oh I should have cut that shit down
[12:10.510 --> 12:15.310]  So i'm gonna say it's a five-day window of good cutting a seven-day window of you better get it done
[12:15.310 --> 12:18.130]  And then by day 14, you've kind of missed your opportunity
[12:18.670 --> 12:24.750]  Then it says could I go into that 48 to 72 hour darkness right when I get to 20 to 30 percent and then harvest?
[12:25.070 --> 12:32.510]  Thank you for everything you do and the information high five. Love the new instagram live feeds and youtube videos. Awesome, man
[12:32.590 --> 12:38.990]  Thank you. Um, they mentioned the instagram live videos. I haven't mentioned that here on the show in a while every monday
[12:39.310 --> 12:44.130]  It's 7 10 ish. Don't hold me to it. It's about 7 7 10 7 15
[12:44.510 --> 12:51.310]  Every monday at 7 ish mountain time. I go on instagram live. My instagram account is iry underscore genetics
[12:51.470 --> 12:55.570]  I r i e underscore. I hope you can spell genetics iry genetics
[12:56.270 --> 13:01.170]  And I ramble for about an hour on instagram live. I let the chat throw me questions
[13:01.490 --> 13:06.290]  Anything they ask I do my best to field the question. They're alive in the chat and answer your grow question
[13:06.370 --> 13:11.410]  So if you've got a basic grow question, that is a good place to catch me instagram live. I hang out
[13:11.490 --> 13:16.690]  I take dabs I get lit up. I talk to my friends. It's much more informal than the show just a relaxed hangout
[13:16.850 --> 13:21.250]  So i'm glad you were enjoying the instagram lives. I'm glad you're loving the new youtube videos
[13:21.250 --> 13:25.170]  They take a little bit more work a little bit of editing, but i'm glad you're checking those out now
[13:25.170 --> 13:29.010]  Let's address the question. Can I put it into 24 to 72 hours darkness?
[13:29.410 --> 13:33.010]  Right when I get to 20 to 30 and then harvest yes, that would work
[13:33.650 --> 13:39.970]  The lemon jeffrey is not a big fan of that long dark period. I've ran this plan a lot of times more of the
[13:40.690 --> 13:44.050]  Whiter leaf shorter squatty plants prefer that dark period
[13:44.450 --> 13:49.490]  The taller thinner leaf plants are not as much of a fan of that type of treatment, but it will work
[13:49.890 --> 13:53.890]  Your plan your strategy will work. You'll see a lot of dead leaves when you take it out of there
[13:53.890 --> 13:55.890]  They'll be all yellow. They'll fall off
[13:55.970 --> 13:59.190]  But it will work for you that will not be a bad strategy
[13:59.650 --> 14:02.370]  Uh get them to 20 to 30. That's about where you want them
[14:02.370 --> 14:08.130]  Anyway, throw them into that 48 to 72 hour and then chop them down. That should be just about perfect for you
[14:09.090 --> 14:11.650]  Uh, maybe cut down one plant on one day and do that
[14:11.890 --> 14:15.730]  Cut down the next one another day and do that if you've been growing multiple plants in the same area
[14:16.050 --> 14:18.930]  Just see how much they differ see how much which one you like
[14:18.930 --> 14:21.570]  That's the way you dial it in perfectly for your setup
[14:21.570 --> 14:25.090]  But you're not going to notice too much difference cutting down two or three days apart
[14:25.330 --> 14:28.610]  And then that 48 to 72 hour darkness that should harden them up
[14:28.610 --> 14:30.610]  It may make them beef up a little bit at the end
[14:30.610 --> 14:34.450]  But uh lemon jeffrey is not a big fan of that sort of treatment
[14:34.450 --> 14:38.290]  I think the uh, the sativa dominant cultivars are the things that want to be
[14:38.530 --> 14:41.330]  Uh put in the or not put in the dark the old indica dominant. Sorry
[14:41.330 --> 14:45.250]  I messed that all up, but you know what I mean now i'll say it correctly the indica dominant
[14:45.470 --> 14:51.250]  Cultivars are the plants that seem to prefer that extended dark the sativa plants. They just go a little bit crazy get kind of angry
[14:51.570 --> 14:55.490]  All right. Now there is another part to this question easy followed up a few days later
[14:55.730 --> 14:59.650]  It says when you were ramping down ppm and you go into flush
[15:00.050 --> 15:05.570]  Do you maintain the same distance with your lights when I started to ramp down and go into flush?
[15:05.650 --> 15:11.410]  It seems like my plants act like they are too close to the light much love and appreciation for everything you do
[15:11.490 --> 15:16.050]  I wish I could attach pictures as always my lemon. Jeffrey is killing it, bro
[15:16.130 --> 15:21.170]  I am excited to smell and smoke some of that lemon. Jeffrey. Let's hang out one of these days and talk shop
[15:21.570 --> 15:23.570]  But let's address this question here
[15:23.570 --> 15:29.410]  When we are ramping down ppms and going into flush do I maintain the same distance with my lights? Yes
[15:30.130 --> 15:35.890]  Because at this point my lights are probably raised as high as they go because the plants have grown all the way into the light
[15:35.890 --> 15:40.290]  I don't waste any space. I get the plants as tall as they can go in my spaces
[15:41.410 --> 15:46.770]  Uh in a lot of commercial environments the lights stay at one height. They're 12 or 16 or 18 feet high
[15:46.930 --> 15:52.370]  They stay there they don't move that's where they go. I can't move them. They're on a trapeze with 100 lights in one thing
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.570]  They're not movable
[15:53.570 --> 15:55.810]  So the lights stay there in a personal grow
[15:55.810 --> 15:58.930]  Like I said, the plants have grown so tall that there's nowhere to move the lights
[15:59.650 --> 16:03.970]  You were saying that it looks like uh, the plants are starting to act as if they are too close
[16:04.050 --> 16:05.890]  I followed up with the backup question
[16:05.890 --> 16:11.330]  I said what gives you the idea that it looks like the plants are too close and he said that the leaves start doing funny
[16:11.330 --> 16:18.050]  Things and the pistols start curling. I think that is just the plant being done. There's no more nutrient left the plants
[16:18.130 --> 16:21.810]  Like hey, you were feeding me and now there's no more nutrient. I'm kind of hungry
[16:21.970 --> 16:24.530]  I'm gonna freak out a little bit the leaves kind of curl up
[16:24.690 --> 16:28.050]  It's sucking all the nutrients all the sugars all the energy from those leaves
[16:28.370 --> 16:30.690]  I think that it's just the end of the plant's life
[16:30.770 --> 16:34.210]  I think it's done and it knows it and it looks a little bit upset about it
[16:34.210 --> 16:39.810]  But the good thing is we're not growing to smoke leave consume leaf if those leaves look a little shitty at the end
[16:39.970 --> 16:44.070]  That's okay. We want big fat trichome covered buds that taste delicious
[16:44.370 --> 16:47.010]  If your leaves are kind of yellow and crispy and falling off
[16:47.090 --> 16:52.690]  That's a good sign that you possibly probably flushed and there's nothing left in that plant. It's going to burn nice and smooth
[16:52.930 --> 16:57.570]  It'll burn clean. It'll taste real. Well, all your friends will be really proud be really impressed
[16:57.810 --> 17:01.490]  You won't choke you won't cough. It should be a grade product. So
[17:02.050 --> 17:04.050]  Um, I don't think you're too close to the light
[17:04.130 --> 17:07.650]  If you feel like you're too close if the plants are too close raise it up a little bit
[17:07.890 --> 17:11.410]  If that's not an option, maybe you can turn it down. I'm not sure your situation
[17:11.490 --> 17:13.330]  I don't know if you're in a tent if you're in a room
[17:13.330 --> 17:15.890]  I don't know if you're limited on height. I don't know if you can go any higher
[17:16.130 --> 17:17.810]  I don't know if you can turn down the ballast
[17:17.810 --> 17:20.530]  But the only way to find out is to experiment and do it
[17:20.610 --> 17:26.130]  But honestly, I think that last little bit is when the plants want the most light so I wouldn't stress too much
[17:26.370 --> 17:28.290]  I think they're going to be okay
[17:28.290 --> 17:32.950]  Uh, but experiment like I said, the only way to learn is to experiment
[17:33.810 --> 17:37.490]  All right, you guys i've got one long message. Let's see. How long is this one?
[17:37.650 --> 17:40.450]  This one may take us a minute to get through so i'm going to take a little bit of a drink here
[17:40.610 --> 17:43.970]  And then we're going to journey into this message that comes from our friend blue
[17:44.130 --> 17:47.810]  But let's take a drink you guys sing the jeopardy song in your head or something while I do this
[17:52.680 --> 17:58.280]  All right, I feel much better about my life and about myself now that i'm hydrated let's get into this message from our boy blue
[17:59.480 --> 18:01.000]  This one goes
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.800]  Hey rasta jeff. I've been listening for some time now and i've been meaning to give you some support. Hey, thank you
[18:05.880 --> 18:09.400]  I appreciate the support don't ever feel like you have to contribute to get help from me
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.400]  But it is a good way to get you to the top of the list
[18:11.720 --> 18:17.400]  It says I listen to your show at work regularly and it really helps me get through some of the long tedious hot and mundane
[18:17.480 --> 18:18.600]  work days
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.480]  And thank you. I love knowing i'm getting people through work when I was working in the commercial grow and I was getting all sweaty
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.840]  And had joey diaz in my ear. I felt the same way joe diaz joey rogan just getting me through life
[18:29.240 --> 18:32.600]  It feels real good. So thank you. I'm glad I can give you that feeling then it goes on to say
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.920]  The production quality is excellent and the advice is even better. Thank you
[18:37.160 --> 18:40.200]  I'm sure you noticed I went back to the big mic and the big headphones today
[18:40.360 --> 18:44.920]  Just trying to put out a super quality show while I learned the other microphone. I was more comfortable with this one
[18:45.480 --> 18:47.880]  It goes on to say on one of your recent episodes
[18:48.040 --> 18:52.280]  You said everyone thinks you are a psychic because you knew to answer the air conditioning questions
[18:52.600 --> 18:58.120]  But you've been dropping the exact episodes. I have needed at the perfect times. I love hearing that
[18:58.840 --> 19:03.080]  I love knowing that I put out an air conditioner episode right when everybody's room got hot
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.800]  I love knowing that I put out an episode about whatever you were thinking about right at the right time
[19:07.880 --> 19:09.720]  You were thinking about it. That is awesome
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.360]  That means that life is happening as it is supposed to and i'm able to help people right at the right time
[19:14.360 --> 19:19.560]  So that feels good. It goes on to say i've recently purchased a couple of packs of your seeds
[19:19.720 --> 19:22.920]  I got a rise and double dragon great selections, bro
[19:23.160 --> 19:28.360]  I plan to purchase many more build that collection bro like pokemon. You gotta catch them all then it goes on
[19:28.360 --> 19:34.600]  It says I decided to pop the double dragon seeds first. I was very happy to get a 100% germination rate on them
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.080]  Uh, then it says that he's got some less than satisfactory results with other breeders
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.560]  Uh, then it says I was even more excited to see that four out of the five turned out to be female
[19:43.960 --> 19:47.560]  That is awesome, dude full germination and a lot of girls. That's always fun
[19:47.640 --> 19:50.840]  It says the girls are growing beautifully and are approaching week seven of flower
[19:50.900 --> 19:56.040]  Currently, I will email you with some pictures very soon as I know you would enjoy seeing them
[19:56.040 --> 19:58.040]  Yes, please send me some emails of my kids
[19:58.040 --> 20:01.560]  I'd love to see what they look like what they're wearing what they're doing how they're doing in school
[20:01.800 --> 20:07.560]  Uh, send me pictures of those seedlings those fucking week seven flowers now. Can't wait to see them
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.000]  Now let's get back on track. It says so back to you being a psychic. Yes psychic jeff here at your service
[20:13.320 --> 20:18.200]  Uh, call me now for your free reading says a couple of days after starting the double dragon seeds
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.600]  I thought to myself I wish rasta jeff had a strain review episode on double dragon
[20:22.760 --> 20:27.320]  So I went to check and it was like two weeks earlier you had dropped that episode
[20:27.800 --> 20:31.080]  Um, so I was psychic and ahead of you. I put it out there for you
[20:31.160 --> 20:37.100]  All right moving forward. I decided I was probably going to self a couple of these girls and create some s1s
[20:37.800 --> 20:44.860]  Something i've done before with success and that was right about the time your feminizing episode which offered me a plethora of additional
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.160]  knowledge on the subject
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.880]  Uh, so our friend got some seeds then I put an episode out about the seeds then he wanted to self them
[20:51.960 --> 20:55.320]  I put out an episode about selfing. This is working out pretty well for you, bro
[20:55.720 --> 21:01.320]  Um, then it says I am rambling as i'm sure you understand so I will get to the topic at hand
[21:01.400 --> 21:05.080]  Hey, no worries about rambling if anybody knows rambling that is me
[21:05.320 --> 21:09.160]  Welcome to the ramble club hashtag. They like it when we ramble if you guys notice
[21:09.240 --> 21:12.680]  I do keep checking my phone because i'm hoping to get some rambling in with white mike today
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.940]  Just waiting for him to text back and make no promises
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.320]  Now let's get to the rest of I apologize for holding this email right in front of my face
[21:19.320 --> 21:23.400]  Also, if you guys are watching on the video, I just blocked the whole camera with this paper. I apologize
[21:24.120 --> 21:28.360]  Trying to be professional here. It goes on to say my question now is
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.980]  How does female pollen react with different genetics?
[21:32.440 --> 21:38.940]  If I throw some other girls of different genetic background in with the plant that i'm selfing what traits and characteristics
[21:39.480 --> 21:47.340]  Should I expect the offspring to keep from the plant producing pollen and the plant producing seeds if they are not the same genetics?
[21:47.740 --> 21:51.980]  That's a very good question. It says I assume they will still mostly be female
[21:52.300 --> 21:57.500]  Now if you were making if you used a reversed plant a reversed female to make pollen
[21:57.580 --> 21:59.980]  They should all be female if you did it correctly
[22:00.220 --> 22:05.900]  If you select it properly if that plant is a true female if it doesn't have intersex traits, then you should have all
[22:06.680 --> 22:11.500]  100 female offspring so I know they should all be female. But how does an f1?
[22:11.500 --> 22:12.540]  No, it's not an f1
[22:12.540 --> 22:17.900]  Which you were working with is an r1 and an s1 when you take that reversed pollen
[22:18.220 --> 22:22.940]  And put it on a plant of the same cultivar. That is an s you are selfing it
[22:23.020 --> 22:29.420]  I think i've described this in another episode the selfing the s1 that is when a plant basically fucks itself
[22:29.500 --> 22:31.820]  That is a crass way to put it, but you'll never forget it
[22:32.060 --> 22:36.780]  If you take pollen of golden goat put pollen of golden goat on golden goat
[22:36.940 --> 22:41.660]  It just selfed itself. It fucked itself. It made s1 seeds. It's all golden goat
[22:41.980 --> 22:47.980]  Now let's talk about if we take that pollen and put it on other cultivars if we took the golden goat pollen
[22:48.140 --> 22:54.220]  And put it on a lemon skunk plant. We have now created lemon jeffrey. That is an r1 a reversal one
[22:54.300 --> 22:59.500]  We took we took I said took i'm not even going to edit that. I want you guys to hear me say took it happened
[22:59.820 --> 23:00.380]  All right
[23:00.380 --> 23:06.880]  We took reversed pollen and put that reversed pollen on a female cultivar and that made reversal
[23:07.280 --> 23:13.060]  Seeds r1 so s1 when it fucks itself that's selfed r1 reversal pollination
[23:13.600 --> 23:16.260]  R1 reversed pollen onto a different cultivar
[23:16.800 --> 23:21.120]  So i'm sure you're never going to forget that with those terms in your brain. So let's continue it says
[23:21.760 --> 23:27.280]  They'll all be female. But how does r1 and s1 differ when using male and female pollen?
[23:27.900 --> 23:29.900]  Additionally if a plant is hemp
[23:30.160 --> 23:33.360]  And I breed it to a plant that produces almost all thc
[23:33.760 --> 23:39.840]  I assume I would find phenotypes that express cbd dominance thc dominance and some that are mixed ratios
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.640]  Your input would be very valuable on this. You don't need to read this on the next episode
[23:44.960 --> 23:50.000]  Uh, it wasn't the next one, but I got you up there pretty quickly, bro, and it says thank you for keeping me entertained
[23:50.240 --> 23:57.120]  Thanks for supercharging my girl with excellent advice. I love your style and thank you for breeding fire genetics, bro
[23:57.120 --> 24:02.080]  This is a great question gives me an opportunity to talk a little bit about breeding and everybody knows
[24:02.080 --> 24:04.880]  I love to talk about breeding and I don't do it enough on the show. So
[24:05.440 --> 24:05.920]  um
[24:05.920 --> 24:12.240]  If you take the pollen from your reversed female you want to know what traits to expect if you put that on
[24:12.640 --> 24:19.040]  Different plants if the plant producing seeds and the plant producing pollen are not the same plant and then you want to know about
[24:19.280 --> 24:24.000]  Thc and cbd ratios from different uh ratio plant parent plants
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.920]  That's a very good question
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.620]  If you take that reversed pollen and put it on other cultivars
[24:30.340 --> 24:32.340]  depending on the
[24:32.400 --> 24:36.500]  dominance of traits of those plants you are most likely going to see
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.240]  basically
[24:38.240 --> 24:40.240]  50-50 crosses if you take
[24:40.260 --> 24:44.580]  Golden goat and lemon skunk and you reverse that golden goat. We've done this before
[24:45.300 --> 24:48.260]  Put that reversed golden goat pollen onto the lemon skunk
[24:48.500 --> 24:53.300]  It makes lemon jeffrey if you look at those two plants if you were able to grow those two plants
[24:53.300 --> 24:56.820]  I've never released the lemon skunk that i've got it's kind of a very unique cut
[24:57.380 --> 25:01.860]  If you look at that plant and you grow it and you know it and then you look at the golden goat and you grow
[25:01.860 --> 25:08.580]  It you know it and then you see lemon jeffrey. You can see exactly which traits came from which parent I can see it very clearly
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.740]  So when you take that pollen and you put it on other plants
[25:13.380 --> 25:19.860]  Most commonly you're going to get 50 percent plants that look like 50 percent the mommy and the daddy
[25:20.180 --> 25:24.340]  Then you're going to get I should say closer to 30 ish percent because there are going to be some outliers
[25:24.340 --> 25:27.540]  But in the main main scope of things we're going to get 50
[25:28.260 --> 25:32.340]  That look like 50 50 of the mommy and 50 of the daddy
[25:32.580 --> 25:36.420]  Then we're going to get 25 that look like the original mom plant
[25:36.660 --> 25:41.860]  Then we're going to get 25 that look like the original pollen donor, which we'll call the dad plan
[25:42.100 --> 25:47.940]  So those are the three main phenotypes you're going to see now depending on recessive traits of the parent plants
[25:48.020 --> 25:51.300]  We used we may see signs of the grandparents popping up
[25:51.300 --> 25:56.500]  Whatever the grandparents of each of those plants were you may see some of those phenotypes pop up
[25:56.500 --> 25:59.780]  So you're going to get the main three then maybe a couple of others
[25:59.940 --> 26:05.560]  So there's probably going to be three dominant phenotypes one major phenotype a couple of secondaries
[26:05.780 --> 26:09.380]  And then two outliers that kind of come up is generally what I think you're going to see
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.420]  In a feminized cross that you're putting pollen on other plants. It's very similar to crossing
[26:14.740 --> 26:21.540]  Uh non-feminized stuff very similar you're going to find very similar, uh punnett squares charts results
[26:21.940 --> 26:23.940]  So now let's talk about the second part of this
[26:24.660 --> 26:28.660]  If a plant is hemp and you breed it to a plant that produces thc
[26:29.220 --> 26:33.080]  And by hemp we're just uh indicating that that plant contains 0.3
[26:33.780 --> 26:38.020]  Percent thc or less that is a hemp plant. So it's got high in cbd
[26:38.900 --> 26:45.220]  Not very little to none thc in it now we're going to breed that plant to king solomon who is very high in thc
[26:45.540 --> 26:49.860]  What's going to happen there? We're going to find plants that are rich in cbd
[26:50.180 --> 26:52.820]  We're going to plan find plants that are rich in thc
[26:52.820 --> 26:55.140]  Which one did I say first you're going to find the other one?
[26:55.220 --> 26:59.220]  I got stoned and forgot you're going to find thc rich plants. You're going to find cbd rich plants
[26:59.460 --> 27:02.740]  You're going to find plants with crazy numbers either direction now
[27:02.740 --> 27:06.260]  The beautiful thing that will happen is hopefully we will find outliers
[27:06.500 --> 27:09.300]  Hopefully we find something that surpasses both parents
[27:09.620 --> 27:12.820]  Maybe we find something with way more cbd than the starting parents
[27:12.900 --> 27:18.340]  Maybe we find something with thc that far surpasses the starting parents. That would be our goal here
[27:18.740 --> 27:21.160]  That number will be in there the cannabinoids
[27:21.860 --> 27:28.900]  In my opinion in my experience the cannabinoids don't breed as solid as a lot of the other traits if you want to focus on
[27:29.060 --> 27:32.980]  Just cannabinoid breeding you kind of have to line breed for the cannabinoids
[27:32.980 --> 27:39.480]  You can't look for growth and vigor and flavor and structure. You got to go for the cannabinoids. That is my experience
[27:39.860 --> 27:45.540]  I that has not been my goal is breeding for cannabinoids but watching and seeing that is what I think you got to do
[27:45.540 --> 27:50.840]  So you breed one line that you go straight up that line breeding for cannabinoids if it's cbd or thc
[27:51.140 --> 27:56.180]  Then you breed your b line and you breed that one for whatever you're looking for flavor structure
[27:56.420 --> 27:58.420]  Whatever else you're missing from the other one
[27:58.420 --> 28:03.780]  Then once you've got those both solid how you want them you breed those together and that's how you make a true f1
[28:03.860 --> 28:05.780]  That's exactly what you want
[28:05.780 --> 28:09.700]  That's a long way to get to it. But in my experience from what i've read and seen
[28:10.020 --> 28:14.740]  It's a little more difficult to breed. Uh, you got a line breed to get the cannabinoids exactly how you want
[28:15.460 --> 28:20.180]  But you're going to see a lot of different, uh combinations. You'll see thc you'll see cbd
[28:20.180 --> 28:25.720]  You'll see them down the middle, but then you're going to find outliers on each direction and then hopefully you find some skyrockets
[28:26.360 --> 28:31.960]  What's that called transgressive segregation that might be what it's called when you find some plants that are way better than the parents
[28:32.120 --> 28:34.120]  That surpass the performance of the parents
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  All right, blue. I hope I answered your question
[28:37.320 --> 28:39.240]  Um, I feel like I went over that one pretty well
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.320]  It was kind of quick, but I feel like I covered it quite well
