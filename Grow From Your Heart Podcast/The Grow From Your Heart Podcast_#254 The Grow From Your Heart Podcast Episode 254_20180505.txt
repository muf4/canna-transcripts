[00:17.080 --> 00:19.680]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.680 --> 00:21.540]  It's time for episode number 254
[00:21.540 --> 00:23.480]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.480 --> 00:27.120]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.260]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.260 --> 00:29.480]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.480 --> 00:31.960]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.960 --> 00:33.320]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:33.320 --> 00:34.800]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.680]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.520]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.440]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.440 --> 00:43.360]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.560]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.560 --> 00:47.200]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.200 --> 00:49.640]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.720]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.760 --> 00:57.800]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:57.800 --> 01:01.600]  I just took a gigantic dab of some Lemon OG Shatter
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.440]  and I dunked it in some Lemon Jeffrey
[01:03.440 --> 01:06.200]  high terpene full spectrum extract.
[01:06.200 --> 01:08.360]  And I took the dab a little too hot
[01:08.360 --> 01:10.800]  and it sent me to another planet for a second,
[01:10.800 --> 01:12.960]  but I am back and I'm ready to do a podcast for you.
[01:12.960 --> 01:13.960]  Big shout out to all my friends
[01:13.960 --> 01:16.520]  that were joining me on Instagram Live.
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.320]  I've been doing some Instagram Live videos lately.
[01:19.320 --> 01:22.000]  That's right, I go to the IRI Genetics Instagram page.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.160]  It's IRI underscore genetics and I go live occasionally.
[01:25.160 --> 01:26.220]  Haven't been doing it a whole bunch,
[01:26.220 --> 01:29.200]  but I just did a nice little Instagram video with my friends.
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.380]  It's a good time, thanks for hanging out.
[01:31.380 --> 01:33.260]  Before we get too far, this podcast is brought to you
[01:33.260 --> 01:35.240]  by our friends at thedankteam.com.
[01:35.240 --> 01:36.680]  That's right, if you wanna add some new seeds
[01:36.680 --> 01:39.000]  to your lineup, if you need new genetics in the garden,
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.040]  if you need regular or feminized genetics,
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.940]  make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[01:44.820 --> 01:46.460]  Thedankteam.com carries brands like Archive,
[01:46.460 --> 01:50.620]  Sin City, Mile High, IRI Genetics, Rare Dankness,
[01:50.620 --> 01:53.220]  The Cali Connection, and many more trusted brands.
[01:53.220 --> 01:54.780]  Make sure you check out thedankteam.com
[01:54.780 --> 01:57.340]  and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[01:57.340 --> 02:00.100]  All right, let's get down to business, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00.100 --> 02:02.700]  On episode number 250, I challenged you guys
[02:02.700 --> 02:06.340]  to identify the backwards voice and the voice that said,
[02:06.340 --> 02:10.300]  "'Oh shit, Rasta Jeff' in the opening song on episode 248."
[02:10.300 --> 02:12.180]  That's right, on number 248, okay,
[02:12.180 --> 02:13.940]  on all of the Throwback Thursday episodes lately,
[02:13.940 --> 02:16.660]  I've been playing some goofy music that I've made myself,
[02:16.660 --> 02:19.140]  just playing around, putting stuff together with GarageBand.
[02:19.140 --> 02:20.820]  I like to make funky music when I'm all stoned,
[02:20.820 --> 02:22.220]  just chilling out, it's fun.
[02:22.220 --> 02:24.460]  I wanted a cool opening for Thursday, something different,
[02:24.460 --> 02:25.900]  that's what came out of me.
[02:25.900 --> 02:28.000]  I decided to put some voices in there.
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.340]  There's one backwards and it says something.
[02:30.340 --> 02:32.940]  Somebody did identify the backwards voice correctly.
[02:32.940 --> 02:36.300]  Also, a lot of people have identified the voice that said,
[02:36.300 --> 02:38.540]  "'Oh shit, Rasta Jeff' in the house."
[02:38.540 --> 02:40.820]  First off, let me say, it was not Doug Benson.
[02:40.820 --> 02:42.660]  I'll say it again, so many people thought
[02:42.660 --> 02:44.500]  it was Doug Benson, it was not.
[02:44.500 --> 02:48.060]  Half of the people that tweeted me, that sent me emails,
[02:48.060 --> 02:51.420]  they all said, I think that's Doug Benson, it was not Doug.
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.140]  So to tell you who it actually was,
[02:54.140 --> 02:56.020]  I'm going to read a tweet from somebody
[02:56.020 --> 02:58.020]  who calls themselves Rex,
[02:58.020 --> 03:00.140]  and their Twitter handle is fucking awesome,
[03:00.140 --> 03:03.300]  it's at TipTopMagoo, and if you know anything
[03:03.300 --> 03:06.100]  about podcasting or comedy, you know that TipTopMagoo
[03:06.100 --> 03:07.820]  is a Joey Diaz reference.
[03:08.740 --> 03:09.660]  And this person said,
[03:09.660 --> 03:11.500]  "'That's our boy Lee, boom boom, Syatt,
[03:11.500 --> 03:14.540]  "'the flying Jew, the original Christ killer.'"
[03:14.540 --> 03:17.260]  That is absolutely accurate, it was Lee Syatt,
[03:17.260 --> 03:18.420]  ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18.420 --> 03:20.860]  Lee Syatt was the person who said,
[03:20.860 --> 03:22.780]  "'Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.'"
[03:22.780 --> 03:24.620]  Several people guessed that it was Lee Syatt.
[03:24.620 --> 03:26.260]  I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[03:26.260 --> 03:29.080]  I'm pretty sure this email came from,
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.500]  excuse my voice, that's from the dabs.
[03:32.500 --> 03:36.060]  I'm pretty sure this email came from our friend TipTopMagoo.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.380]  I'm pretty sure this correlates.
[03:37.900 --> 03:39.340]  He said, "'Hey Rasta Jeff, I love the show.
[03:39.340 --> 03:42.540]  "'Been regularly listening since around 1.40,
[03:42.540 --> 03:43.940]  "'but have caught up on all the episodes
[03:43.940 --> 03:46.120]  "'thanks to the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.120]  "'I'm from California and have one grow under my belt,
[03:49.120 --> 03:51.100]  "'and that didn't go so well due to high temps
[03:51.100 --> 03:52.820]  "'and a grow tent that was in my garage.'"
[03:52.820 --> 03:53.980]  Yeah, that sounds disastrous
[03:53.980 --> 03:55.700]  if you don't have proper air conditioning.
[03:55.700 --> 03:57.800]  He also said, "'I'm currently planning out my next grow
[03:57.800 --> 03:58.700]  "'in the near future.
[03:58.700 --> 04:00.560]  "'I'll be donating to your Patreon
[04:00.560 --> 04:02.680]  "'and writing an email asking about a sealed garden
[04:02.680 --> 04:05.300]  "'with CO2 supplementation in the near future,'
[04:05.340 --> 04:07.660]  which is excellent because another good friend of mine
[04:07.660 --> 04:11.500]  was asking about sealed grows with CO2 versus vented grows,
[04:11.500 --> 04:13.700]  so that'll be a great topic for me to research
[04:13.700 --> 04:15.540]  and give a good presentation on.
[04:15.540 --> 04:17.060]  I look forward to the Patreon help,
[04:17.060 --> 04:18.460]  and I look forward to your email.
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know about Patreon,
[04:20.620 --> 04:23.460]  check out patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[04:23.460 --> 04:25.620]  It will tell you everything you want to know.
[04:25.620 --> 04:26.460]  The email goes on to say,
[04:26.460 --> 04:29.000]  "'Anyways, I'm in my 30s and I am a medical user.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.940]  "'I appreciate your hard work on the show,'
[04:30.940 --> 04:32.140]  and then he gives me his address
[04:32.140 --> 04:34.040]  "'because I told him he would win a prize
[04:34.040 --> 04:36.060]  "'if he identified the voice.'
[04:36.060 --> 04:37.020]  And then he said, "'I don't dab.
[04:37.020 --> 04:37.860]  "'I'm a lightweight.
[04:37.860 --> 04:40.760]  "'I'm holding off on smoking for Sober October.'"
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.200]  Man, you get cooler by the fucking second in your message.
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.680]  You're a Joey listener.
[04:44.680 --> 04:46.080]  I can tell you're a Joey Diaz
[04:46.080 --> 04:48.700]  and a member of the Church of What's Happening Now
[04:48.700 --> 04:50.200]  by your tweets.
[04:50.200 --> 04:51.960]  And now you're talking about Sober October,
[04:51.960 --> 04:53.440]  which means you listen to Rogan,
[04:53.440 --> 04:55.400]  which means you listen to Burt,
[04:55.400 --> 04:57.000]  which means you listen to Tommy Buns,
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.320]  which means you probably listen to Pants,
[04:59.320 --> 05:02.120]  or Mom, or Christina P., whatever you want to call her.
[05:03.080 --> 05:04.640]  Yeah, so that means you're great,
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.080]  and that means that we should probably get together
[05:06.080 --> 05:07.920]  and take some dabs if you're ever in Colorado
[05:07.920 --> 05:10.240]  or if I am ever in your neck of the woods.
[05:10.240 --> 05:11.840]  Yeah, I've got your address, man.
[05:11.840 --> 05:13.080]  Ha ha, yeah.
[05:13.080 --> 05:15.680]  Anyway, I'm gonna need your real name to send you a prize
[05:15.680 --> 05:18.500]  because I can't just send you stuff with no name.
[05:18.500 --> 05:19.840]  So send me your real name also,
[05:19.840 --> 05:21.440]  since I've got your address.
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.440]  I think I've got your real name, but I'm not certain,
[05:23.440 --> 05:26.240]  and I don't wanna send a package with no real name on it
[05:26.240 --> 05:28.160]  because it will come back to me.
[05:28.160 --> 05:29.720]  They're not fucking around with the mail lately.
[05:29.720 --> 05:31.240]  If you don't put a full real name on it,
[05:31.240 --> 05:32.800]  they just send shit right back,
[05:32.800 --> 05:33.800]  and I gotta just resend it.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.960]  So send me your real name.
[05:34.960 --> 05:36.120]  I'll get you a prize.
[05:36.120 --> 05:38.600]  It won't be anything illegal, so don't worry.
[05:38.600 --> 05:40.040]  It's probably gonna be some stickers
[05:40.040 --> 05:41.400]  and some other stuff like that.
[05:41.400 --> 05:43.420]  So check your mailbox.
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.460]  In the near future, hey,
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.620]  thanks for being one of the first people.
[05:45.620 --> 05:46.800]  I'm not sure that you were the first one,
[05:46.800 --> 05:48.240]  but I loved that you said,
[05:48.240 --> 05:50.280]  it's our boy Lee Boom Boom Syatt,
[05:50.280 --> 05:52.640]  the Flying Jew, original Christ killer.
[05:52.640 --> 05:53.640]  Yes, that's fucking awesome.
[05:53.640 --> 05:56.760]  If you listen to the Church of What's Happening Now,
[05:56.760 --> 05:58.320]  you know what the fuck we're talking about,
[05:58.320 --> 06:00.300]  and this guy's cool as shit just for saying that.
[06:00.300 --> 06:03.900]  So thanks for the participation, Tip Top Magoo.
[06:03.900 --> 06:06.620]  I'm pretty sure that's you who also sent this email.
[06:06.620 --> 06:08.580]  I appreciate the participation.
[06:08.580 --> 06:09.820]  So of course it was Lee Syatt.
[06:09.820 --> 06:11.100]  I've got another email,
[06:11.100 --> 06:12.700]  or it's actually probably from Twitter.
[06:12.700 --> 06:13.940]  Let's see what I've got.
[06:13.940 --> 06:15.340]  It says, I think the person saying,
[06:15.340 --> 06:18.180]  oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house is Lee Syatt.
[06:18.180 --> 06:19.820]  Also a great podcast,
[06:19.820 --> 06:23.360]  and the best cannabis podcast available.
[06:23.360 --> 06:25.500]  Very informative and thorough information.
[06:25.500 --> 06:27.060]  Keep up the hard work.
[06:27.060 --> 06:28.640]  Much love.
[06:30.620 --> 06:32.820]  This guy, I think, was the first one
[06:33.820 --> 06:35.420]  to email me saying that.
[06:35.420 --> 06:37.540]  I think this was the first emailer.
[06:37.540 --> 06:41.380]  So if that was you, send me a reply to that,
[06:41.380 --> 06:43.340]  reply to this by sending me your address,
[06:43.340 --> 06:44.180]  and I'll get you a prize.
[06:44.180 --> 06:45.300]  Let me know where you are,
[06:45.300 --> 06:46.980]  and we'll get you a little prize.
[06:46.980 --> 06:48.500]  Everyone's gonna get some stickers or something.
[06:48.500 --> 06:49.340]  If you're in Colorado,
[06:49.340 --> 06:51.460]  we might meet up and get you something cooler than stickers.
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.900]  What's the next message I've got?
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.820]  It said, yo Rasta Jeff,
[06:54.820 --> 06:57.340]  at the top of episode 248,
[06:57.340 --> 06:59.620]  oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[06:59.660 --> 07:00.500]  Oh, they think it's me.
[07:00.500 --> 07:01.420]  No, that wasn't me.
[07:01.420 --> 07:03.300]  Sorry, dude, you thought it was me.
[07:04.180 --> 07:05.600]  Not me.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.540]  And then he goes on to say,
[07:07.540 --> 07:09.180]  by the way, learned of you and your podcast
[07:09.180 --> 07:10.780]  at the Dude Grows Cup event this year.
[07:10.780 --> 07:12.940]  I was the brown skin Rasta in the back,
[07:12.940 --> 07:14.400]  hanging near Dextractor,
[07:14.400 --> 07:16.300]  and I live in Delaware.
[07:16.300 --> 07:19.060]  By chance I win, I'm coming to Colorado for the prize.
[07:19.060 --> 07:20.800]  PS, next time I'm in South Colorado,
[07:20.800 --> 07:23.940]  need to go have a good Ital vegan spot.
[07:23.940 --> 07:25.220]  And then he signed it with his real name,
[07:25.220 --> 07:26.940]  and then he also says,
[07:26.980 --> 07:30.220]  and then he signed it with his AKA, Defia-Man.
[07:30.220 --> 07:31.760]  Big up, much respect, Defia-Man.
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.600]  Thanks for the message.
[07:32.600 --> 07:33.700]  Sorry you were not correct,
[07:33.700 --> 07:35.700]  but since you're from Delaware, man,
[07:35.700 --> 07:38.280]  and we did not link up at the Dude Grows Cup,
[07:38.280 --> 07:39.900]  the next time you're in Colorado,
[07:39.900 --> 07:42.220]  let's go get some vegan or Ital food together,
[07:42.220 --> 07:44.120]  and you will leave there with an Irie gift.
[07:44.120 --> 07:44.960]  I promise you.
[07:44.960 --> 07:46.660]  So hit me up the next time you're coming to Colorado.
[07:46.660 --> 07:49.420]  Warn me, because man, my schedule sucks.
[07:49.420 --> 07:51.040]  I stay so busy.
[07:51.040 --> 07:53.220]  So you gotta give me a heads up a long time in advance
[07:53.220 --> 07:55.560]  if you wanna make plans with me, but do it,
[07:55.560 --> 07:58.440]  and we'll grab some Ital Rasta food or some vegan food,
[07:58.440 --> 08:01.080]  and we'll lace you up with some Irie genetics.
[08:01.080 --> 08:04.060]  All right, I've got one more to read.
[08:04.060 --> 08:05.880]  It says, what up Rasta?
[08:05.880 --> 08:07.960]  This one comes from, let's see, do they want their name?
[08:07.960 --> 08:09.060]  I don't know.
[08:09.060 --> 08:10.800]  I don't think they want their name said.
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.920]  It said, what up Rasta?
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.960]  The backwards voice is Granny.
[08:13.960 --> 08:15.280]  That is fucking accurate.
[08:15.280 --> 08:17.560]  The backwards voice at the start of the podcast
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.400]  where it was,
[08:18.400 --> 08:19.960]  and there's a voice in there,
[08:19.960 --> 08:21.620]  and then it goes, boom, to boom, to boom.
[08:21.620 --> 08:24.400]  That voice is the dabbing Granny.
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.880]  And of course, the oh shit voice is Lee Syatt.
[08:27.880 --> 08:29.760]  This person gets a prize.
[08:29.760 --> 08:30.600]  Send me an email.
[08:30.600 --> 08:31.440]  I've got all of these emails
[08:31.440 --> 08:32.640]  stacked up on my desk right here,
[08:32.640 --> 08:34.160]  so I can read them.
[08:34.160 --> 08:35.380]  Reply to me.
[08:35.380 --> 08:37.200]  Send me your address, all that good stuff.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.900]  I will get you a cool prize package.
[08:38.900 --> 08:39.740]  Big shout out to this guy.
[08:39.740 --> 08:41.540]  I don't know if you want your name said, man,
[08:41.540 --> 08:44.200]  but the backwards voice absolutely was Granny,
[08:44.200 --> 08:45.760]  and nobody's gonna figure out
[08:45.760 --> 08:47.120]  that I just used the same clip.
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.480]  It said, this is the dabbing Granny,
[08:48.480 --> 08:50.400]  and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[08:50.400 --> 08:51.860]  That's all she said.
[08:51.860 --> 08:52.760]  That's all it was.
[08:53.600 --> 08:55.400]  Anyway, that's enough of that.
[08:55.400 --> 08:57.000]  That contest has been won.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.160]  I'm gonna go through,
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.520]  and if you tweeted me,
[08:59.520 --> 09:00.720]  and if you sent me an email,
[09:00.720 --> 09:03.540]  remind me, and shoot me your address,
[09:03.540 --> 09:06.620]  and I will get you a prize package,
[09:06.620 --> 09:08.920]  some stickers, some whatnot.
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.320]  If you're in Colorado, let's link up.
[09:10.320 --> 09:13.360]  I'll get you some cool prizes.
[09:13.360 --> 09:15.280]  I'm marking shit off the list here.
[09:15.280 --> 09:17.740]  I got to the guy whose name starts with a T.
[09:17.740 --> 09:20.880]  I got A-R, and I got that guy.
[09:20.920 --> 09:24.600]  And lots of people on Twitter.
[09:24.600 --> 09:25.760]  Cool, okay.
[09:25.760 --> 09:28.280]  Try to keep this pirate ship on course.
[09:28.280 --> 09:29.180]  On the last episode,
[09:29.180 --> 09:31.120]  I was complaining that there was an iPhone update,
[09:31.120 --> 09:33.320]  and I could not find some emails.
[09:33.320 --> 09:35.360]  I am sure I'm not the only one
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.640]  that was having a fucking problem
[09:36.640 --> 09:38.440]  with the iPhone email setup.
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.500]  It has been corrected.
[09:39.500 --> 09:42.920]  I don't use the iPhone email app anymore.
[09:42.920 --> 09:43.920]  It sucks.
[09:43.920 --> 09:46.240]  It keeps telling me that all my passwords are wrong.
[09:46.240 --> 09:48.480]  I go correct the password.
[09:48.480 --> 09:49.880]  It tells me the password's wrong again.
[09:49.880 --> 09:51.200]  I go create a new password,
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.920]  and it keeps telling me the wrong is pissing me off.
[09:52.920 --> 09:53.760]  It doesn't work.
[09:53.760 --> 09:54.580]  It sucks.
[09:54.580 --> 09:57.480]  Until they fix that, I'm going to avoid that application.
[09:57.480 --> 09:58.520]  What I did do, though,
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.560]  was I installed the Gmail or the Hotmail app,
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.680]  whatever it was,
[10:02.680 --> 10:05.120]  whatever corresponds with the email addresses I'm using,
[10:05.120 --> 10:06.600]  and I just used those apps,
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.600]  and they seem to be working just fine.
[10:08.600 --> 10:10.580]  And I found all the emails I thought I was missing.
[10:10.580 --> 10:12.140]  I found all the tweets I thought I was missing.
[10:12.140 --> 10:13.960]  Everything is back to normal.
[10:13.960 --> 10:15.520]  Thanks for being patient with me.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.440]  If you've sent me an email,
[10:16.440 --> 10:18.240]  and I haven't gotten to it yet, I will.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.640]  Oh, you guys hear that jingle in the background?
[10:20.400 --> 10:21.360]  Shout out to Mick the dog.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.960]  I'm dog sitting tonight.
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.240]  Mick the dog is hanging out over there
[10:24.240 --> 10:26.480]  by the door where the draft comes in,
[10:26.480 --> 10:28.160]  having a great, quiet evening.
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.560]  That dog is so lazy, dude.
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.400]  Jeez.
[10:30.400 --> 10:31.240]  All right.
[10:31.240 --> 10:33.400]  So yeah, all those emails are back,
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.680]  so I will get to your email.
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.040]  Also, another thing,
[10:36.040 --> 10:38.240]  I was doing an Instagram Live video,
[10:38.240 --> 10:39.520]  and a viewer on the video,
[10:39.520 --> 10:41.760]  it may have been Kelvin Medina, I don't remember.
[10:41.760 --> 10:42.640]  Shout out to Kelvin.
[10:42.640 --> 10:45.200]  Either way, they told me that Stitcher
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.320]  had not loaded the Throwback Thursday episode.
[10:47.320 --> 10:48.760]  That would explain why the ratings
[10:48.760 --> 10:50.200]  were so weak on Stitcher this week.
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.160]  They did not get the Throwback Thursday episode
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.720]  as expected.
[10:53.720 --> 10:54.600]  It's fixed.
[10:54.600 --> 10:55.680]  It is back up now.
[10:55.680 --> 10:56.680]  I went, well, it should be.
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.120]  I reposted it right before I recorded this episode.
[10:59.120 --> 11:01.320]  By the time this comes out, it should be corrected.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.480]  I'll make sure that it's corrected
[11:02.480 --> 11:05.000]  by the time this show posts Monday morning.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.480]  So Stitcher's been corrected.
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.160]  The emails have been corrected.
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.120]  Since we are talking about corrections,
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.160]  let me reach for an email from a listener
[11:12.160 --> 11:14.200]  who corrected me.
[11:14.200 --> 11:15.200]  So in a recent episode,
[11:15.200 --> 11:17.040]  I think it was number 252,
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.580]  I talked about deepwater culture.
[11:19.400 --> 11:20.240]  Before I talked about deepwater culture,
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.340]  I made it clear that I don't grow in deepwater culture
[11:22.340 --> 11:25.980]  and I'm not 100% sure about a lot of the things I'm saying.
[11:25.980 --> 11:27.620]  I think most of what I said was accurate,
[11:27.620 --> 11:29.420]  but a listener, a regular listener,
[11:29.420 --> 11:31.860]  and a frequent emailer, Mr. St. Skinny,
[11:31.860 --> 11:33.020]  sent me a message.
[11:33.020 --> 11:34.740]  And it says,
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.380]  Howdy Rasta Jeff.
[11:36.380 --> 11:37.800]  Not sure if anyone mentioned this yet,
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.060]  but you misspoke when you did your brief explanation
[11:40.060 --> 11:41.140]  of deepwater culture.
[11:41.140 --> 11:42.820]  In a deepwater culture system,
[11:42.820 --> 11:44.980]  the mist that keeps the roots above the water moist
[11:44.980 --> 11:47.740]  is produced via an air stone and air pump.
[11:47.740 --> 11:49.900]  The bubbles from the stone float up and pop,
[11:49.900 --> 11:51.700]  misting the roots in the process.
[11:51.700 --> 11:54.400]  What you are explaining sounds more like aeroponics,
[11:54.400 --> 11:57.460]  where they use misters or spinning cloner type inserts.
[11:57.460 --> 11:59.580]  I hope I don't come off as rude or anything.
[11:59.580 --> 12:01.020]  That isn't my intention at all.
[12:01.020 --> 12:03.060]  I just wanted to make sure you were made aware of it
[12:03.060 --> 12:05.060]  so you can correct yourself on the next episode
[12:05.060 --> 12:06.860]  or something like that.
[12:06.860 --> 12:08.420]  I know a lot of people really look forward
[12:08.420 --> 12:09.760]  to your knowledge and information,
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.120]  and I'm one of them.
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.300]  Hey, thanks for correcting me, man.
[12:12.300 --> 12:15.060]  I never feel bad about being corrected.
[12:15.060 --> 12:16.220]  That makes me a better grower,
[12:16.220 --> 12:17.780]  that makes me a better podcaster.
[12:17.780 --> 12:18.660]  Correct me.
[12:18.660 --> 12:21.060]  I will never take offense to it.
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.500]  I fucked up, you guys.
[12:22.500 --> 12:23.820]  I said the wrong shit,
[12:23.820 --> 12:25.860]  and I know a lot of people rely on me.
[12:25.860 --> 12:29.200]  So always, always correct me if I say something wrong.
[12:29.200 --> 12:30.940]  I will do my best to get on the microphone
[12:30.940 --> 12:34.100]  as soon as possible and make a correction in my error.
[12:34.100 --> 12:35.280]  So shout out to Saint Skinny.
[12:35.280 --> 12:37.380]  Hey, dude, I owe you some stickers also.
[12:37.380 --> 12:39.780]  So while I'm sending out all of these sticker packs
[12:39.780 --> 12:42.400]  for my friends on Twitter, my friends that emailed me,
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.880]  everybody that won these contests
[12:43.880 --> 12:46.600]  for the identifying Lee Syatt's voice,
[12:46.600 --> 12:49.120]  Saint Skinny, you also send me your address.
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.560]  I'll send you some stickers or something cool
[12:51.560 --> 12:52.860]  because you helped me out.
[12:52.860 --> 12:54.920]  He also says, great timing on the episode, by the way.
[12:54.920 --> 12:57.160]  I'm actually finishing building my aeroponic cloner
[12:57.160 --> 12:59.840]  as we speak and transplanting some lemon balm
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.720]  into deep water culture tomorrow.
[13:01.720 --> 13:03.640]  Hey, that means you've done that by now
[13:03.640 --> 13:06.120]  because this was sent to me several days ago.
[13:06.120 --> 13:07.000]  Almost a month ago.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.040]  I apologize.
[13:08.040 --> 13:08.880]  No, this was recent.
[13:08.880 --> 13:10.700]  Sorry, I can't tell my dates anymore.
[13:10.700 --> 13:12.600]  Time's traveling so fast.
[13:12.600 --> 13:14.080]  And he also says, keep up the great work.
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.400]  One more thing, Mama Saint wanted me to tell you
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.280]  you're officially adopted.
[13:18.280 --> 13:20.060]  And she says, hi, son, love ya.
[13:20.060 --> 13:21.560]  You better be staying out of trouble
[13:21.560 --> 13:24.560]  and growing lots of dink like you're supposed to.
[13:24.560 --> 13:26.080]  Damn, your mom's cool as shit, man.
[13:26.080 --> 13:27.080]  I'm proud to be adopted.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.500]  I'm proud to be part of the Canna Saint family.
[13:29.500 --> 13:32.600]  We got Mama Saint, Skinny Saint, Rasta Saint now.
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.180]  Thanks for making me part of the family.
[13:34.180 --> 13:35.360]  I appreciate it.
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.640]  I'm glad to be in the car
[13:36.640 --> 13:38.600]  or wherever we are right now listening.
[13:38.600 --> 13:41.040]  I feel like I'm in the living room chilling with you guys.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.760]  I'm sure you guys feel like you're at my dab table
[13:42.760 --> 13:44.080]  chilling with me.
[13:44.080 --> 13:45.520]  Good to be part of the family.
[13:45.520 --> 13:47.200]  He finishes with, LOL, gotta love her.
[13:47.200 --> 13:48.200]  Take it easy, brother.
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.680]  Then he signs it, Saint.
[13:49.680 --> 13:51.380]  Saint, Skinny, and fam, thanks for reaching out to me.
[13:51.380 --> 13:52.680]  Thanks for the correction.
[13:52.680 --> 13:55.080]  Much love and respect to you and the whole family.
[13:55.080 --> 13:56.800]  I'm glad mom's doing well, bro.
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.000]  All right, I'm gonna press pause.
[13:58.000 --> 13:58.920]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.280]  When we come back, I think I'm gonna read more emails.
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.480]  All right, podcast world, I just got hydrated,
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.480]  took a couple of dabs.
[14:05.480 --> 14:07.320]  I was scrolling through Instagram.
[14:07.320 --> 14:08.560]  While I was scrolling through Instagram,
[14:08.560 --> 14:11.440]  I saw something that, I may sound like a hypocrite,
[14:12.480 --> 14:14.360]  but I saw something that I wanna mention.
[14:14.360 --> 14:17.700]  I saw a video of a person taking a gigantic dab
[14:17.700 --> 14:20.200]  while driving their car in traffic in California,
[14:20.200 --> 14:23.160]  going fairly fast with a lot of traffic around them
[14:23.160 --> 14:25.720]  with the window half down so everybody could see them.
[14:25.720 --> 14:27.400]  And they were doing an Instagram video.
[14:27.400 --> 14:28.560]  It looked like a Snapchat video
[14:28.560 --> 14:29.760]  that got posted up to Instagram.
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.560]  I'm not gonna shout out the account.
[14:32.680 --> 14:33.840]  Man, don't do that.
[14:33.840 --> 14:35.040]  I know it sounds like I'm a hypocrite
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.480]  because I have talked about medicating in a vehicle before,
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.120]  but there's a difference.
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.960]  Medicating in a vehicle and not getting caught,
[14:41.960 --> 14:44.360]  that happened, that's over, that's done.
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.600]  This dude posted it up to Instagram.
[14:47.520 --> 14:48.360]  There's evidence.
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.180]  Guys, think about this.
[14:49.180 --> 14:51.280]  All the videos that you post to social media,
[14:51.280 --> 14:55.400]  all of that shit, if you do do something and it goes wrong,
[14:55.400 --> 14:56.680]  what if this guy was driving, and I know,
[14:56.680 --> 14:58.280]  I sound like a hypocrite, I sound like your dad,
[14:58.280 --> 14:59.920]  I sound like an old man, but I want you,
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.120]  I'm supporting the cannabis community
[15:02.120 --> 15:03.920]  and the legalization of cannabis,
[15:03.920 --> 15:06.300]  and this dumb shit is what will hinder it.
[15:06.300 --> 15:08.000]  Yes, I am kind of hypocritical.
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.320]  I have consumed cannabis in a vehicle before.
[15:10.320 --> 15:12.760]  I did not record it for Snapchat and Instagram.
[15:12.760 --> 15:14.600]  I've done that before, I will not do it again.
[15:14.600 --> 15:16.040]  All those videos are gone.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.360]  Now, think about this.
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.200]  If you do end up doing something wrong,
[15:19.200 --> 15:21.520]  if you hurt somebody while you're filming a dab video,
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.600]  or if you hurt somebody after filming a dab video,
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.100]  and somebody sees a dab video of you on social media
[15:26.100 --> 15:29.440]  while driving a vehicle, that's going to appear in court.
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.880]  You're going to be on trial,
[15:30.880 --> 15:32.740]  and there's going to be a big gigantic screen
[15:32.740 --> 15:35.640]  in a courtroom with a video of you taking a dab in the car
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.060]  and blowing that dab out.
[15:37.060 --> 15:39.460]  The next slide on that video is going to be a picture
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.780]  of whoever you drove into in the hospital
[15:41.780 --> 15:44.140]  with a tube coming out of their face and all fucked up.
[15:44.140 --> 15:46.780]  So, I know I'm kind of hypocritical,
[15:46.780 --> 15:48.600]  but I'm calling myself out right along with you.
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.380]  Let's quit posting videos of ourselves
[15:50.380 --> 15:51.860]  consuming while driving.
[15:51.860 --> 15:54.120]  Let's just be smarter, let's just be safer.
[15:54.120 --> 15:55.000]  Think about that shit.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.420]  Think about everything you're doing.
[15:56.420 --> 15:58.620]  Think about it as a headline in the newspaper.
[15:58.620 --> 16:01.100]  Dumbass crashes car while dabbing.
[16:01.100 --> 16:02.940]  You don't want to be that dumbass, do you?
[16:02.940 --> 16:05.340]  All right, just support the legalization of cannabis
[16:05.340 --> 16:07.140]  by not being a dumbass.
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.820]  Shout out to White Mike for making me think straight.
[16:09.820 --> 16:11.760]  All right, now quite often I like to ask people
[16:11.760 --> 16:13.220]  to let me know what they're smoking on
[16:13.220 --> 16:14.700]  while they're listening to the podcast.
[16:14.700 --> 16:16.280]  I want you to tweet me, I want you to email me,
[16:16.280 --> 16:17.940]  I want you to contact me somehow
[16:17.940 --> 16:20.080]  and let me know how you were consuming cannabis
[16:20.080 --> 16:21.740]  while listening to the podcast.
[16:21.740 --> 16:24.180]  You can email me, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[16:24.180 --> 16:27.200]  You can tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.300]  You can find me on Instagram, it's irie underscore genetics.
[16:30.300 --> 16:33.440]  On Facebook, it's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[16:33.440 --> 16:34.860]  The best way to get in touch with me
[16:35.380 --> 16:37.860]  is the growfromyourheartathotmail.com email address.
[16:37.860 --> 16:41.060]  That is the easiest and most convenient for me.
[16:41.060 --> 16:43.100]  This listener says, what up, Ross to Jeff,
[16:43.100 --> 16:45.600]  I'm smoking Malibu pie while transplanting
[16:45.600 --> 16:47.680]  and listening to the new topping episode.
[16:47.680 --> 16:48.520]  Peace, bro.
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.200]  Dude, you really do have the most grow talk
[16:50.200 --> 16:51.820]  over any other podcast.
[16:51.820 --> 16:53.860]  I would not be the grower that I have become
[16:53.860 --> 16:55.820]  if we didn't have you and your show.
[16:55.820 --> 16:56.660]  Thanks, bro.
[16:56.660 --> 17:00.700]  By the way, I'm doing it on the down low in North Carolina.
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.900]  So this dude's transplanting some Malibu,
[17:03.900 --> 17:05.660]  or he's smoking some Malibu pie
[17:05.660 --> 17:08.760]  while doing transplanting work and listening to my show
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.780]  while growing in an illegal state on the down low.
[17:11.780 --> 17:13.140]  You got a lot of balls, man.
[17:13.140 --> 17:15.640]  You're very brave growing down there in North Carolina.
[17:15.640 --> 17:17.140]  Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[17:17.140 --> 17:20.540]  Enjoy smoking that Malibu pie, that sounds fucking delicious
[17:20.540 --> 17:22.940]  and bro, be super careful out there.
[17:22.940 --> 17:25.020]  And I'm glad I've helped you out with your grow
[17:25.020 --> 17:27.560]  and thanks for saying I've got the most grow talk.
[17:27.560 --> 17:29.300]  I appreciate that and I'm glad you're a good grower, man.
[17:29.300 --> 17:32.460]  I'm glad I was able to help you become the grower you are.
[17:32.460 --> 17:34.020]  Sounds like you're getting it right.
[17:34.020 --> 17:35.120]  Big shout out.
[17:35.120 --> 17:37.820]  All right, Podcast World, our next email comes from
[17:37.820 --> 17:40.580]  Turt McGirt and it goes like this.
[17:40.580 --> 17:42.820]  Ross to Jeff, I've been a loyal listener
[17:42.820 --> 17:44.720]  since like episode 89 or so.
[17:44.720 --> 17:47.580]  I absolutely love the knowledge you provide.
[17:47.580 --> 17:49.800]  I have taken a couple of genetics classes
[17:49.800 --> 17:51.900]  and you're quite on point with your explanations
[17:51.900 --> 17:55.620]  of genotype, phenotype, transgressive segregation
[17:55.620 --> 17:57.020]  and on and on.
[17:57.020 --> 17:59.380]  My mom is now running a perpetual grow.
[17:59.380 --> 18:02.780]  The only problem is she is killing the not so great clones.
[18:03.780 --> 18:06.380]  The reason for the email is I recently bought a five pack
[18:06.380 --> 18:09.020]  of your cookie stomper seeds from the dank team.
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.340]  They had great service by the way,
[18:10.340 --> 18:12.000]  throwing in some bonus seeds.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.940]  I was wondering if you had any tips or helpful info
[18:14.940 --> 18:17.900]  on how it grows and finishes, maybe what to look for
[18:17.900 --> 18:21.300]  or to identify the different phenotypes.
[18:21.300 --> 18:24.140]  Cookie stomper, man, cookie stomper is a great cross.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.220]  There will be some very,
[18:25.220 --> 18:27.180]  it depends on what you're looking for, honestly.
[18:27.180 --> 18:29.500]  There'll be some very Girl Scout cookies
[18:29.500 --> 18:32.620]  dominant phenotypes in there that will grow kind of tall
[18:32.620 --> 18:34.500]  and kind of skinny and they'll just produce
[18:34.500 --> 18:35.700]  some popcorn balls up there,
[18:35.700 --> 18:38.120]  but they'll get real purple and real black leaves.
[18:38.120 --> 18:40.960]  If you want like a peppery, spicy,
[18:40.960 --> 18:44.280]  like a Durban poison, OG Kush cross kind of a flavor,
[18:44.280 --> 18:46.020]  I would go for that phenotype.
[18:46.020 --> 18:49.420]  If you want a bigger producer,
[18:49.420 --> 18:50.980]  there's definitely a phenotype in there
[18:50.980 --> 18:52.620]  that is a better producer.
[18:52.620 --> 18:54.620]  I think you'll find the one that you want.
[18:54.620 --> 18:57.620]  I think most of those phenotypes finish
[18:57.620 --> 18:59.700]  in around eight, maybe nine weeks.
[18:59.700 --> 19:00.980]  You don't need to let them go too long,
[19:00.980 --> 19:02.180]  any longer than nine weeks,
[19:02.180 --> 19:04.940]  I don't think is necessary with that cross.
[19:04.940 --> 19:09.540]  63 days, maybe 65 at the absolute most is all you need
[19:09.540 --> 19:10.880]  for the cookie stomper.
[19:12.480 --> 19:13.820]  Since she's a cookie cross,
[19:13.820 --> 19:16.540]  she can get kind of picky about the pH.
[19:16.540 --> 19:18.620]  So make sure you get your pH dialed in.
[19:18.620 --> 19:20.460]  It may be different with each phenotype,
[19:20.460 --> 19:23.060]  like the Girl Scout cookies dominant phenotype
[19:23.060 --> 19:26.340]  may like it a little bit lower than the phenotype
[19:26.340 --> 19:29.800]  that is going to be King Kim grape stomper dominant.
[19:29.800 --> 19:31.940]  So you're gonna have to dial in your pH
[19:31.940 --> 19:33.100]  for your different phenotypes.
[19:33.100 --> 19:35.700]  That may be the challenge with that cross.
[19:35.700 --> 19:38.420]  So I guess the main part is look for the phenotypes.
[19:38.420 --> 19:40.700]  There's gonna be a smaller one, which is cookies dominant.
[19:40.700 --> 19:42.020]  There'll be a larger one,
[19:42.020 --> 19:44.160]  which of course is the King Kim dominant one.
[19:44.160 --> 19:46.500]  There's one that comes out with these pine cones
[19:46.500 --> 19:48.180]  that are real jaggedy and real sharp.
[19:48.180 --> 19:49.740]  That's the one I like.
[19:49.740 --> 19:52.440]  She's just the best smoke, regardless of how she grows.
[19:52.880 --> 19:54.320]  That's the one I prefer to smoke.
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.760]  And it's also the best representation of the hybrid.
[19:56.760 --> 19:59.340]  It's not, or of the polyhybrid or of the F1,
[19:59.340 --> 20:01.240]  however you want to consider that.
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.080]  It's the best.
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.360]  It's what I was going for.
[20:03.360 --> 20:04.640]  It shows the cross the best.
[20:04.640 --> 20:07.760]  So he continues to say,
[20:07.760 --> 20:09.400]  additionally, they sent a three pack
[20:09.400 --> 20:11.360]  of some cookies and cream to Arise,
[20:11.360 --> 20:13.080]  which has been named the cream.
[20:13.080 --> 20:14.640]  And by the way, he says,
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.840]  in which I can't find any info on the strain.
[20:16.840 --> 20:18.320]  I will include some pictures.
[20:18.320 --> 20:19.160]  Oh, cool.
[20:19.160 --> 20:20.120]  He sent some pictures of it also.
[20:20.120 --> 20:22.280]  He also says any tips or hints on this one?
[20:23.120 --> 20:23.960]  Will it eventually have a name?
[20:23.960 --> 20:26.200]  I haven't found much online for this strain.
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.440]  Cookies and cream to Arise
[20:27.440 --> 20:29.680]  has been officially named the cream.
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.520]  It's fairly new.
[20:30.520 --> 20:33.160]  There hasn't been much online for it so far.
[20:33.160 --> 20:34.480]  I've been posting some pictures of it.
[20:34.480 --> 20:37.620]  If you check out my Instagram, iry underscore genetics,
[20:37.620 --> 20:41.360]  there's a lot of cool pictures of the cream on there.
[20:41.360 --> 20:42.520]  You're going to want to grow those.
[20:42.520 --> 20:43.880]  Those are fun to grow.
[20:43.880 --> 20:47.360]  He goes on to say my setup is illegal as hell in Wisconsin.
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.440]  Should I even say Wisconsin?
[20:48.440 --> 20:50.160]  If you said that, he continues to say,
[20:50.160 --> 20:52.360]  but I'm using two hydrofoam ebb and flow
[20:52.360 --> 20:54.280]  recirculating hydroponic systems.
[20:54.280 --> 20:57.200]  One has 12 pots, two 1000 lights.
[20:57.200 --> 21:00.760]  The other has 18 with three 1000 watt lights
[21:00.760 --> 21:01.960]  because of power constraints.
[21:01.960 --> 21:04.520]  I mean, these three run at 600 watts for now.
[21:04.520 --> 21:07.600]  We stagger them by six weeks for regular harvests.
[21:07.600 --> 21:10.280]  Our crops come from clones using an easy cloner.
[21:10.280 --> 21:13.160]  We have the clones in the box for three weeks,
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.080]  acting like the seedling feeding for the first week.
[21:16.080 --> 21:18.340]  We give them Clonex and Rapid Start.
[21:18.340 --> 21:21.140]  Then they go into the hydro pots with clay pebble medium.
[21:21.140 --> 21:23.100]  So far you're doing all right, it sounds like.
[21:23.100 --> 21:26.420]  Another question I have is that we go right into 1212
[21:26.420 --> 21:28.700]  as soon as they are transplanted to the hydro pot.
[21:28.700 --> 21:32.140]  So no vegging aside from the extra week in the easy cloner.
[21:32.140 --> 21:35.140]  Any idea what week we should start on
[21:35.140 --> 21:36.500]  in the feeding schedule?
[21:37.500 --> 21:39.060]  Let's see, it seems like I might've missed something.
[21:39.060 --> 21:41.820]  Another question I have is we go right into the 1212
[21:41.820 --> 21:43.500]  as they are transplanted into the hydro pot.
[21:43.500 --> 21:46.780]  So no vegging aside from the extra week in the easy cloner.
[21:46.780 --> 21:49.500]  The question is, any idea what week we should start on
[21:49.500 --> 21:50.600]  in the feeding schedule?
[21:50.600 --> 21:53.300]  I argue week three, my partner says week two.
[21:53.300 --> 21:56.860]  This is our first run with your stuff.
[21:56.860 --> 21:57.780]  There's more in the email also,
[21:57.780 --> 21:59.420]  I just wanna figure out this question.
[21:59.420 --> 22:01.580]  Are you asking when you put them into flower,
[22:01.580 --> 22:03.220]  should you start on week one or week three
[22:03.220 --> 22:04.300]  of the flowering cycle?
[22:04.300 --> 22:06.300]  Or I'm not sure what the question is.
[22:06.300 --> 22:10.220]  Since you're not vegging, you're going directly to flower
[22:10.220 --> 22:11.660]  when you're putting them into the hydro pots,
[22:11.660 --> 22:13.780]  you would wanna feed them week one
[22:13.780 --> 22:15.820]  of the flowering feed, right?
[22:15.820 --> 22:17.020]  Because it's week one of flowering.
[22:17.020 --> 22:18.620]  You're putting them into flower.
[22:18.620 --> 22:21.060]  So the day that you put them, it says,
[22:21.060 --> 22:23.820]  we go right into 1212 as soon as they're transplanted
[22:23.820 --> 22:25.100]  into the hydro pots.
[22:25.100 --> 22:27.220]  So no vegging, which at that point,
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.220]  I would say you want to give them week one
[22:31.220 --> 22:33.100]  of whatever your flowering nutrients are,
[22:33.100 --> 22:34.200]  because it's week one.
[22:36.020 --> 22:37.780]  Any idea what week we should start on
[22:37.780 --> 22:38.820]  in the feeding schedule?
[22:38.820 --> 22:41.020]  I argue week three, my partner says week two.
[22:41.020 --> 22:42.180]  I'm gonna argue and say week one,
[22:42.180 --> 22:43.540]  because it's week one of flower.
[22:43.540 --> 22:44.580]  You've come from the cloner,
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.100]  you went an extra week in the cloner,
[22:46.100 --> 22:48.660]  you got the rapid start and stuff in there.
[22:48.660 --> 22:50.180]  They live, they survive, they're rooted,
[22:50.180 --> 22:52.420]  you're going into your pebbles.
[22:52.420 --> 22:54.500]  What are you putting them in?
[22:54.500 --> 22:56.800]  Easy cloner, clones into the box for three weeks,
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.340]  then we can wrap so they go into hydro pots
[22:58.340 --> 22:59.220]  with clay pebbles.
[23:01.220 --> 23:02.100]  Yeah, man, start feeding them.
[23:02.100 --> 23:03.860]  If you're gonna flower them that day,
[23:03.860 --> 23:05.380]  give them a flowering mix.
[23:05.380 --> 23:06.220]  Why not?
[23:06.220 --> 23:07.040]  You're flowering.
[23:07.040 --> 23:08.380]  Start feeding them flowering nutrients.
[23:08.380 --> 23:10.100]  They're not gonna need vegetative nutrients
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.100]  because you're flowering.
[23:11.100 --> 23:13.640]  So yeah, if I did not answer that correctly,
[23:13.640 --> 23:15.560]  if I did not decipher that code
[23:15.560 --> 23:17.240]  or interpret your question correctly,
[23:17.240 --> 23:20.260]  please re-email me and I will answer that more appropriately.
[23:20.260 --> 23:22.000]  I'm gonna continue with the email.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.420]  It says, I'm a little confused as our batch prior,
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.440]  supposedly something called Ice Princess
[23:26.440 --> 23:28.720]  and Northern Lights was absolutely great.
[23:28.720 --> 23:30.480]  Dense, potent crystals and fire bud.
[23:30.480 --> 23:31.800]  However, the last two cycles,
[23:31.800 --> 23:33.920]  the buds have been fluffy and weak.
[23:33.920 --> 23:36.440]  It's been hot due to summer, but we run CO2.
[23:36.440 --> 23:39.800]  It gets up to 95 at times in the room.
[23:39.800 --> 23:41.400]  We really have no climate controls.
[23:41.400 --> 23:42.580]  I'm thinking that's the issue
[23:42.580 --> 23:45.420]  because the dense monsters were grown in the winter.
[23:45.420 --> 23:48.500]  What's the ideal temps to make these babies thrive?
[23:48.500 --> 23:50.100]  Yes, that was absolutely your problem.
[23:50.100 --> 23:51.540]  95 degrees is too hot.
[23:51.540 --> 23:54.100]  95 made them fluff up.
[23:54.100 --> 23:55.420]  Those plants were getting sweaty.
[23:55.420 --> 23:56.240]  They didn't wanna,
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.740]  it was like sitting on a hot bus with their legs crossed,
[23:58.740 --> 24:00.060]  man, they didn't wanna have their legs crossed.
[24:00.060 --> 24:01.740]  It was getting goopy and hot and sweaty.
[24:01.740 --> 24:03.080]  They wanted to uncross their legs.
[24:03.080 --> 24:04.660]  They had nowhere to go in that heat.
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.100]  So they just started stretching,
[24:06.100 --> 24:08.100]  making some space in there and fluffing out.
[24:08.100 --> 24:12.540]  I would say you wanna get that temp closer to 77,
[24:13.380 --> 24:15.260]  maybe 80, 81, 82 at the highest.
[24:15.260 --> 24:18.940]  I would never go any higher than 85, get it down to 77.
[24:18.940 --> 24:21.540]  I would maybe start off at like 85 in veg
[24:21.540 --> 24:26.020]  and work my way down to like 77 during the day cycle, 85.
[24:26.020 --> 24:28.700]  At the very start of flowering, you're at 85.
[24:28.700 --> 24:30.220]  And by the end of the flowering cycle,
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.720]  you've worked your way down to 77 during the day.
[24:32.720 --> 24:34.820]  That just kind of mimics the outdoors.
[24:34.820 --> 24:37.620]  It kind of lets them know what part of flower they're in
[24:37.620 --> 24:39.300]  and it encourages bud growth
[24:39.300 --> 24:41.500]  and it gives them better conditions throughout their cycle.
[24:41.500 --> 24:42.700]  That's what I would do.
[24:43.720 --> 24:46.380]  Let's see, there's more to the email, what ideal temps.
[24:46.380 --> 24:49.220]  So 77 degrees, 82 degrees.
[24:49.220 --> 24:50.860]  That's kind of the range I would stick in.
[24:50.860 --> 24:53.220]  It's a five degree range to work with.
[24:53.220 --> 24:55.940]  Lastly, are you experienced in hydro setups?
[24:55.940 --> 24:58.140]  Not really, dude, not very much so,
[24:58.140 --> 24:59.380]  but I may be able to help just
[24:59.380 --> 25:00.840]  because I've got some knowledge.
[25:00.840 --> 25:02.340]  The store was more than happy to sell it,
[25:02.340 --> 25:05.060]  but now they seem to not want to provide advice.
[25:05.060 --> 25:07.500]  I'm discreet and I only talk about my crops in general
[25:07.500 --> 25:10.620]  as not to spook them, yet I get little help.
[25:10.620 --> 25:12.220]  Yeah, that's how they are, man.
[25:12.220 --> 25:13.380]  They don't want to give you help.
[25:13.380 --> 25:15.300]  They just want to sell you more shit.
[25:15.300 --> 25:16.400]  And they're also scared.
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.260]  If they help you out, they could be part of your crime.
[25:20.260 --> 25:23.020]  And you may want to go to another hydro store
[25:23.020 --> 25:24.720]  or just start shopping on Amazon.
[25:25.600 --> 25:27.380]  If something goes wrong, they'll turn you in.
[25:27.380 --> 25:28.860]  They will not take the fall for you.
[25:28.860 --> 25:30.620]  If they get in any trouble, they're going to go,
[25:30.620 --> 25:33.340]  well, that other guy, he, yeah.
[25:33.340 --> 25:35.360]  Anyway, where was I?
[25:35.360 --> 25:38.700]  How often does the reservoir need to be scrubbed out?
[25:38.700 --> 25:40.100]  What do you use to clean it?
[25:40.500 --> 25:43.340]  Is bleach safe or something like hydrogen peroxide?
[25:43.340 --> 25:46.300]  I would clean out the reservoir every seven to 10 days,
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.400]  especially during flower.
[25:47.400 --> 25:48.780]  You're going to want to change.
[25:48.780 --> 25:51.100]  So you asked me the question about what week to start with.
[25:51.100 --> 25:52.900]  Start with week one.
[25:52.900 --> 25:53.860]  If you're going to run,
[25:53.860 --> 25:55.140]  depending on what strain you're running,
[25:55.140 --> 25:57.300]  if you got the cookie stomper, go nine weeks.
[25:57.300 --> 25:59.840]  If you've got the cream, go 10 weeks.
[26:01.620 --> 26:05.380]  Every single week, so start on Monday, that's day one.
[26:05.380 --> 26:07.780]  Clean out the reservoir, put in fresh water,
[26:07.780 --> 26:10.680]  add your nutrients, pH adjusted like you're supposed to,
[26:10.680 --> 26:12.120]  start feeding the plants.
[26:12.120 --> 26:13.260]  That's week one.
[26:13.260 --> 26:15.060]  At the end of week one, maybe Sunday night
[26:15.060 --> 26:18.020]  or Monday morning, you're going to have to top off
[26:18.020 --> 26:18.980]  the water throughout the week.
[26:18.980 --> 26:21.220]  Add water to it, adjust the pH.
[26:21.220 --> 26:24.100]  Sunday night or Monday morning, dump everything out.
[26:24.100 --> 26:25.780]  Scrub it out, clean it real good.
[26:25.780 --> 26:26.620]  What do I use?
[26:26.620 --> 26:28.860]  I would recommend a product called Fizan.
[26:28.860 --> 26:31.060]  I wouldn't use bleach unless you need to.
[26:31.060 --> 26:35.560]  Either Fizan or H2O2 is what I would use to clean that out.
[26:35.560 --> 26:38.560]  Wear proper personal protective equipment.
[26:38.560 --> 26:41.240]  If you're going to use H2O2, wear gloves and a face mask.
[26:41.240 --> 26:42.640]  Be very careful.
[26:42.640 --> 26:45.520]  Dilute the H2O2 with a lot of water.
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.320]  It will fuck your skin up, it'll burn you,
[26:47.320 --> 26:49.160]  but it will clean everything very well.
[26:49.160 --> 26:51.700]  Fizan, I recommend the same thing.
[26:51.700 --> 26:54.000]  Maybe put some water in that Fizan,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.800]  put like 15 to 30 mils or put a bunch of water
[26:56.800 --> 26:58.200]  in your reservoir.
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.360]  Put somewhere between 15 and 25 mils of the Fizan
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.620]  per gallon of water into the reservoir
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.780]  and then turn on a pump and stir it through the pump
[27:05.780 --> 27:07.300]  and whatever and then just scrub the shit
[27:07.300 --> 27:09.220]  out of that reservoir and then dump that
[27:09.220 --> 27:11.340]  and then let it dry or hand dry it,
[27:11.340 --> 27:13.340]  however you need to do it, and then refill it
[27:13.340 --> 27:14.540]  and then remix the nutrients.
[27:14.540 --> 27:17.260]  Do that every week because if you look at the feed chart
[27:17.260 --> 27:18.780]  that came with your nutrients,
[27:18.780 --> 27:21.180]  there's probably a weekly flowering schedule
[27:21.180 --> 27:22.200]  that changes every week.
[27:22.200 --> 27:24.100]  You're gonna start on week one a flower
[27:24.100 --> 27:25.620]  and go week two, week three, week four,
[27:25.620 --> 27:27.460]  and every week it'll be a different feed.
[27:27.460 --> 27:29.580]  So just dump it out, clean it with Fizan,
[27:29.580 --> 27:33.020]  clean it with H2O2, dry it, refill it, remix it,
[27:33.020 --> 27:35.300]  readjust the pH, check the temperature,
[27:35.300 --> 27:36.660]  start feeding the plants.
[27:36.660 --> 27:39.380]  If you mix it up on Wednesday or on Monday,
[27:39.380 --> 27:41.360]  when you get home from work Tuesday,
[27:41.360 --> 27:42.820]  check the pH, check the temps.
[27:42.820 --> 27:44.640]  When you get home from wherever you're going Wednesday,
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.300]  check the pH, check the temps.
[27:46.300 --> 27:48.700]  If water needs to be added, if you're running out of water,
[27:48.700 --> 27:49.540]  add water.
[27:49.540 --> 27:51.440]  After you add water, adjust the pH
[27:51.440 --> 27:53.980]  because every time you add water, the pH is going to change.
[27:53.980 --> 27:56.880]  As the water evaporates, the pH is going to change.
[27:56.880 --> 27:59.200]  Your nutrients are made out of salt most likely.
[27:59.200 --> 28:01.300]  Most of the nutrients we use are salt-based.
[28:01.300 --> 28:02.940]  The salt is not going to evaporate.
[28:02.940 --> 28:04.340]  The water is going to evaporate.
[28:04.340 --> 28:05.620]  Your pH is going to change.
[28:05.620 --> 28:07.820]  Your PPMs are going to change.
[28:07.820 --> 28:09.980]  A little bit of water evaporation will change
[28:09.980 --> 28:11.540]  the dilutions and concentrations
[28:11.540 --> 28:13.720]  of the nutrients in your water.
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.020]  It's going to affect your plants.
[28:15.020 --> 28:16.220]  So make sure you add water.
[28:16.220 --> 28:17.480]  Make sure you adjust the pH.
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.420]  That's something I would definitely say about hydro.
[28:20.420 --> 28:21.820]  All right, and keep it clean
[28:21.820 --> 28:23.220]  because clean is very important.
[28:23.220 --> 28:24.060]  Yes, I would clean it.
[28:24.060 --> 28:26.140]  I would use the Fizan or H2O2.
[28:26.140 --> 28:27.860]  That's what I would recommend.
[28:27.860 --> 28:28.860]  This person goes on to say,
[28:28.860 --> 28:32.020]  anyhow, sorry for hashtag we like it when you ramble.
[28:32.020 --> 28:32.860]  Hey, that's great, man.
[28:32.860 --> 28:35.220]  Ramble at me because you got me rambling
[28:35.220 --> 28:36.500]  and that's what a podcast is.
[28:36.500 --> 28:38.900]  It's one guy talking into a microphone,
[28:38.900 --> 28:40.580]  staring at his computer.
[28:40.580 --> 28:42.340]  I just stare into this computer like a madman
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.940]  and talk to it like it's a person.
[28:43.940 --> 28:46.420]  And then I look down at this paper and read occasionally.
[28:46.420 --> 28:48.780]  But it's just me, so keep me rambling.
[28:48.780 --> 28:49.660]  Keep you rambling.
[28:49.660 --> 28:50.580]  I like it.
[28:50.580 --> 28:53.740]  He also says, oh, it would absolutely make my year so far
[28:53.740 --> 28:55.100]  for some answers.
[28:55.100 --> 28:59.780]  I get mids out of my dro, so it's unacceptable.
[28:59.780 --> 29:02.380]  Man, it's the temperature probably causing you problems
[29:02.380 --> 29:04.320]  and it sounds like your feed schedule may be off
[29:04.320 --> 29:05.980]  if you guys are arguing about which week.
[29:05.980 --> 29:09.180]  Send me another email if I did not correct your question
[29:09.180 --> 29:11.700]  about which week correctly.
[29:11.700 --> 29:13.780]  Send me a more detailed email
[29:13.780 --> 29:15.780]  and we'll get that dialed in for you.
[29:15.780 --> 29:17.740]  Anyway, he wraps up the message by saying,
[29:17.740 --> 29:19.700]  love from Turp McGirt.
[29:19.700 --> 29:21.660]  He also says, I'm not really looking to get this
[29:21.660 --> 29:22.500]  on the show.
[29:22.500 --> 29:24.340]  I just very much respect your opinion
[29:24.380 --> 29:27.740]  and I'm looking for genuine advice as I have to be discreet.
[29:27.740 --> 29:29.460]  Hey, I appreciate the respect and trust
[29:29.460 --> 29:31.220]  in letting me help with your garden
[29:31.220 --> 29:33.900]  and trusting in me to get your garden back on track
[29:33.900 --> 29:36.420]  and helping you get what you need out of your garden.
[29:36.420 --> 29:37.260]  That means a lot to me.
[29:37.260 --> 29:39.020]  I'm glad I can help you out.
[29:39.020 --> 29:40.260]  Man, stay safe.
[29:40.260 --> 29:41.340]  Stay discreet.
[29:41.340 --> 29:42.460]  Don't tell anybody.
[29:42.460 --> 29:43.860]  You might wanna switch grocery stores.
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.980]  You might wanna find a new place.
[29:44.980 --> 29:47.700]  You might wanna start reading shit online
[29:47.700 --> 29:48.940]  and quit asking at the grocery store
[29:48.940 --> 29:50.900]  and start shopping through Amazon
[29:50.900 --> 29:52.860]  because if they're sketched on you,
[29:52.860 --> 29:54.300]  you should be sketched on them also
[29:55.260 --> 29:56.100]  and that's just my opinion.
[29:56.100 --> 29:57.100]  Maybe I'm just paranoid.
[29:57.100 --> 29:58.700]  All right, he also sent a bunch of cool pictures.
[29:58.700 --> 29:59.940]  Man, the garden looks good.
[29:59.940 --> 30:01.220]  I will give the pictures another look.
[30:01.220 --> 30:02.620]  I only printed out the text part.
[30:02.620 --> 30:04.420]  It shows me that the pictures are there.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.300]  I did not print them.
[30:05.300 --> 30:07.820]  I'll look at them on my iPad and see what they look like.
[30:07.820 --> 30:09.140]  Hey, thank you for the email.
[30:09.140 --> 30:10.780]  I wanna thank everybody that sent me an email,
[30:10.780 --> 30:12.100]  everybody that sent me a tweet.
[30:12.100 --> 30:13.860]  Thanks for all the interaction.
[30:13.860 --> 30:16.860]  I did not realize how much of a Twitter following I have.
[30:16.860 --> 30:18.580]  I've gotten a lot of Twitter interaction.
[30:18.580 --> 30:20.660]  I've got three or four Twitter accounts.
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.100]  There's the RastaJeff420.
[30:22.100 --> 30:23.820]  Of course, there's I Read Genetics
[30:23.860 --> 30:25.340]  and there's the one I prefer you use.
[30:25.340 --> 30:26.900]  It's at GFYH Podcast,
[30:26.900 --> 30:28.980]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast Twitter feed.
[30:28.980 --> 30:31.860]  I did not realize the Twitter audience I have got.
[30:31.860 --> 30:32.700]  Thank you.
[30:32.700 --> 30:33.900]  I appreciate the interaction.
[30:33.900 --> 30:36.060]  I'm going to do my best to interact with you guys
[30:36.060 --> 30:37.460]  a little bit more.
[30:37.460 --> 30:39.740]  Also, I've been having fun on Instagram Live,
[30:39.740 --> 30:41.100]  as I said earlier.
[30:41.100 --> 30:42.260]  I'm not on there constantly.
[30:42.260 --> 30:43.100]  I've done one or two,
[30:43.100 --> 30:45.820]  maybe three Instagram videos in the past few days,
[30:45.820 --> 30:46.660]  but it's a lot of fun.
[30:46.660 --> 30:48.940]  I come home from work and get myself situated
[30:48.940 --> 30:50.700]  and take a couple of fat dabs with my friends
[30:50.700 --> 30:53.140]  on Instagram Live and just ramble like a fool.
[30:53.220 --> 30:54.660]  I let people ask Grow questions.
[30:54.660 --> 30:56.780]  It's a good chance to ask a question live
[30:56.780 --> 30:59.220]  and get a response from me right there.
[30:59.220 --> 31:00.060]  It's been fun.
[31:00.060 --> 31:00.900]  So shout out to all the people
[31:00.900 --> 31:01.780]  that are checking me out there.
[31:01.780 --> 31:02.620]  You should check it out.
[31:02.620 --> 31:03.860]  If you don't follow me on Instagram,
[31:03.860 --> 31:06.900]  you should now because you may get to interact
[31:06.900 --> 31:08.460]  and have your questions answered.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.860]  It's at I Read underscore Genetics on Instagram.
[31:10.860 --> 31:12.020]  Check me out.
[31:12.020 --> 31:14.700]  And since I'm over here shamelessly plugging my social media,
[31:14.700 --> 31:16.700]  we've done Twitter, we've done Instagram.
[31:16.700 --> 31:18.500]  Now make sure you follow me on Facebook.
[31:18.500 --> 31:20.780]  Look for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[31:20.780 --> 31:22.500]  Of course, I prefer emails.
[31:22.500 --> 31:25.220]  Emails are the easiest way to interact with me.
[31:25.220 --> 31:29.900]  It's simply growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:29.900 --> 31:31.380]  I do get a lot of emails,
[31:31.380 --> 31:33.220]  but I am working my way through the pile.
[31:33.220 --> 31:34.100]  I'm printing them out.
[31:34.100 --> 31:35.100]  I'm stacking them up.
[31:35.100 --> 31:37.080]  I'm just working my way through as I go.
[31:37.080 --> 31:39.020]  Don't feel frustrated if you've sent me an email
[31:39.020 --> 31:39.860]  and I haven't read it.
[31:39.860 --> 31:40.700]  You never know.
[31:40.700 --> 31:42.220]  It may pop up in the near future.
[31:42.220 --> 31:44.220]  It may pop up in the distant future,
[31:44.220 --> 31:46.860]  but I will try to get through all of them.
[31:46.860 --> 31:47.700]  It's just me.
[31:47.700 --> 31:48.820]  My throat burns out.
[31:48.820 --> 31:51.300]  I can't answer every question on one episode,
[31:51.300 --> 31:52.420]  but I appreciate the interaction.
[31:53.140 --> 31:53.980]  So keep the emails coming, please,
[31:53.980 --> 31:56.740]  and thank you to everyone who has sent me an email.
[31:56.740 --> 32:00.300]  Don't forget that I've put up 100 episodes on YouTube.
[32:00.300 --> 32:02.280]  There are at least 100 episodes up on YouTube
[32:02.280 --> 32:04.620]  by the time this comes out, maybe even more.
[32:04.620 --> 32:06.140]  I'm making the videos slowly.
[32:06.140 --> 32:07.920]  It ties up my computer for a while.
[32:07.920 --> 32:09.380]  I've ranted about that before,
[32:09.380 --> 32:11.260]  but there are YouTube videos.
[32:11.260 --> 32:12.460]  This is the part of the podcast
[32:12.460 --> 32:14.220]  where I remind you about Patreon.
[32:14.220 --> 32:16.740]  If you felt like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[32:16.740 --> 32:19.500]  you can contribute by going to patreon.com
[32:19.500 --> 32:21.380]  slash growfromyourheart.
[32:21.380 --> 32:22.660]  I'm not begging for money.
[32:22.660 --> 32:24.740]  I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting.
[32:24.740 --> 32:27.180]  However, if it were an option, I would go for it.
[32:27.180 --> 32:29.780]  If somebody out there wants to replace my income
[32:29.780 --> 32:31.620]  from working with the Grows or doing whatever,
[32:31.620 --> 32:33.700]  and you want to pay me that income to podcast,
[32:33.700 --> 32:35.500]  I promise you five episodes every week
[32:35.500 --> 32:37.380]  plus a Throwback Thursday episode.
[32:37.380 --> 32:38.220]  That would be worth it.
[32:38.220 --> 32:40.360]  Anyhow, I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting.
[32:40.360 --> 32:42.420]  I love podcasting to help you guys out.
[32:42.420 --> 32:43.300]  I did all the research.
[32:43.300 --> 32:44.580]  I learned all this stuff.
[32:44.580 --> 32:45.460]  I fucked up plants.
[32:45.460 --> 32:46.660]  I fucked up crops.
[32:46.660 --> 32:47.500]  I killed seeds.
[32:47.500 --> 32:48.380]  I killed clones.
[32:48.380 --> 32:49.260]  Then I had success.
[32:49.260 --> 32:50.700]  Then I took great pictures.
[32:50.740 --> 32:52.300]  I've done a lot of stuff.
[32:52.300 --> 32:53.860]  Instead of making you guys struggle
[32:53.860 --> 32:55.140]  and kill a bunch of shit to get there,
[32:55.140 --> 32:56.620]  waste a bunch of time and energy,
[32:56.620 --> 32:57.500]  I've already done it.
[32:57.500 --> 32:59.180]  I figured I'd give you some guidance and help you out.
[32:59.180 --> 33:00.020]  So it's free.
[33:00.020 --> 33:00.860]  It's for you.
[33:00.860 --> 33:01.980]  I'm not asking for anything,
[33:01.980 --> 33:04.700]  but a few people out there did want to contribute.
[33:04.700 --> 33:06.620]  So I started a Patreon campaign.
[33:06.620 --> 33:09.780]  If you'd like to be a part of it, I would appreciate it.
[33:09.780 --> 33:10.620]  Let's see.
[33:10.620 --> 33:11.560]  I think I'm gonna wrap up the podcast.
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.900]  I'm gonna go and make sure
[33:12.900 --> 33:15.340]  that the Throwback Thursday episode that I put up
[33:15.340 --> 33:16.700]  has finally gotten to Stitcher
[33:16.700 --> 33:18.020]  because I've gotten a couple of messages
[33:18.020 --> 33:19.260]  saying it's not there.
[33:19.260 --> 33:21.020]  I'm gonna go make sure it finally went up.
[33:21.020 --> 33:23.380]  I reposted it right before I recorded this.
[33:23.380 --> 33:26.060]  Sometimes it takes Stitcher an hour or two to get to it.
[33:26.060 --> 33:27.660]  I'm gonna go make sure it pops up.
[33:27.660 --> 33:30.000]  Shout out to everybody that listens on Stitcher.
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.780]  I have usually been doing pretty well
[33:31.780 --> 33:32.720]  in the Stitcher rankings.
[33:32.720 --> 33:34.860]  Last week I fell off quite a bit.
[33:34.860 --> 33:37.580]  I think it's because the Thursday episode did not post.
[33:37.580 --> 33:39.100]  I only put out half the amount of content
[33:39.100 --> 33:40.600]  that people rely on me for.
[33:40.600 --> 33:43.180]  So there will be another episode coming up in the feed.
[33:43.180 --> 33:44.180]  If you were looking for that,
[33:44.180 --> 33:45.340]  I hope you got to check it out.
[33:45.340 --> 33:47.980]  I do apologize for Stitcher not grabbing the episode.
[33:47.980 --> 33:49.940]  I apologize for not noticing sooner.
[33:49.940 --> 33:52.740]  Shout out to my friends for pointing that out to me.
[33:52.740 --> 33:54.620]  Once again, I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[33:54.620 --> 33:57.680]  I'll be back Thursday with a Throwback Thursday episode.
[33:57.680 --> 34:00.140]  I'll also be back Monday with brand new content.
[34:00.140 --> 34:02.700]  Make sure you check me out on Instagram Live.
[34:02.700 --> 34:04.380]  Some of the questions and interactions
[34:04.380 --> 34:05.620]  that come from Instagram Live
[34:05.620 --> 34:07.940]  will actually end up becoming podcast material
[34:07.940 --> 34:09.780]  so you never know what could happen.
[34:09.780 --> 34:10.740]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[34:10.740 --> 34:13.260]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend TipTopMagoo.
[34:13.260 --> 34:14.140]  And until next time,
[34:14.140 --> 34:17.000]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.420]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[34:20.420 --> 34:21.260]  Pfft.
