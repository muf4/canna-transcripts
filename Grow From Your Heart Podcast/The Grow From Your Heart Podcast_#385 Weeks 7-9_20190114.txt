[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Hey what's up everybody it's time for episode 385 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.740 --> 00:07.580]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:07.580 --> 00:11.660]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:11.660 --> 00:17.520]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:17.520 --> 00:20.940]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:20.940 --> 00:26.480]  Today I've been taking dabs of Goat Power Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:26.480 --> 00:30.520]  This smells just like golden goat, it tastes just like golden goat, and it has got that
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.200]  sativa punch that golden goat brings.
[00:33.200 --> 00:34.200]  And I love it.
[00:34.200 --> 00:37.400]  I've always been a big fan of golden goat so this is a delicious concentrate.
[00:37.400 --> 00:44.320]  The label says it is 74.8% THC with a total of 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.760]  I really like smoking the goat power, it gets my brain fired up and it tastes amazing.
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.960]  So that is a quality concentrate.
[00:50.960 --> 00:53.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be another grow lesson.
[00:53.500 --> 00:57.460]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[00:57.460 --> 01:02.060]  In this lesson we are going to do weeks 7 through 9, we are wrapping up the grow.
[01:02.060 --> 01:05.460]  It's almost time to harvest so we're going to talk about the final weeks of flowering.
[01:05.460 --> 01:08.620]  We'll work our way into flushing and a little bit of defoliation.
[01:08.620 --> 01:13.160]  If you haven't been following along, I recommend you go back to episode 351 and start listening
[01:13.160 --> 01:14.380]  to the grow lessons.
[01:14.380 --> 01:17.940]  If you are an experienced grower, or if you've been following along, or if you feel like
[01:17.940 --> 01:22.520]  you are up to speed, let's jump right into this grow lesson.
[01:22.540 --> 01:27.400]  At this stage of the flowering cycle, we are entering what I call the third trimester.
[01:27.400 --> 01:30.960]  Most of our plants are going to take between 8 and 10 weeks to flower.
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.780]  I think 9 weeks is a good template to set up these grow lessons.
[01:34.780 --> 01:40.160]  If your plants are going to take more than 9 weeks, I suggest you extend my advice for
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.520]  week 7 one more week.
[01:42.520 --> 01:47.880]  Just repeat the week 7 feeding, the temperature, the humidity, just repeat week 7 one more
[01:47.880 --> 01:51.000]  time if you've got a longer flowering cultivar.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.320]  Now I understand if you're growing from seed, you may not know how long your plants are
[01:54.320 --> 01:55.780]  going to take to flower.
[01:55.780 --> 01:58.040]  You're going to have to pay attention to the trichomes.
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.480]  You're going to have to be prepared to flush about 10 or 14 days before harvest.
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.360]  This is going to take a close eye.
[02:04.360 --> 02:07.240]  You need to pay attention to your trichomes.
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.160]  Often times when I'm running seeds that are brand new and I don't know what to expect,
[02:11.160 --> 02:13.960]  I already decided they're going 70 days.
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.820]  I want to let them flower 70 days and see what they give me.
[02:17.820 --> 02:22.460]  If I decide 70 days was too long, I can run them less time next time, but I like to give
[02:22.460 --> 02:27.220]  them the opportunity to show me what could happen if I go a little bit too long.
[02:27.220 --> 02:29.940]  Some plants really like to bulk up that last week.
[02:29.940 --> 02:33.260]  Some plants really put on some extra trichomes that final week.
[02:33.260 --> 02:36.700]  Some plants really don't do shit for that last week except over ripen.
[02:36.700 --> 02:39.840]  You're going to have to learn your specific cultivar.
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.860]  In most cases, you will discover that 9 weeks is just about right for most plants.
[02:44.860 --> 02:47.620]  Some will take 10 weeks if you want to get them perfect.
[02:47.620 --> 02:52.080]  Some are ready in 8 weeks, which is really advantageous because that puts us a week ahead.
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.260]  We can produce another crop in a commercial environment that really helps out.
[02:56.260 --> 03:00.900]  For these lessons, we're going to focus on a 9 week cultivar.
[03:00.900 --> 03:04.140]  We are now at the start of week 7 in our flowering phase.
[03:04.140 --> 03:06.900]  At this point, the buds are starting to get really fat.
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.320]  They should be getting really sticky.
[03:08.320 --> 03:11.380]  They should be putting off some very nice aromas by now.
[03:11.380 --> 03:14.580]  They may be starting to make some very nice colors.
[03:14.580 --> 03:19.300]  If you are growing from seed, different phenotypes will start becoming very obvious at this point
[03:19.300 --> 03:21.020]  in the flowering stage.
[03:21.020 --> 03:23.320]  You may have one phenotype that has gotten way taller.
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.500]  You may have a phenotype that has stayed shorter.
[03:25.500 --> 03:27.620]  You may have one that is way branchier.
[03:27.620 --> 03:32.140]  You will really start seeing the different traits now that we are later in flower.
[03:32.140 --> 03:34.060]  Week 7 is what I call the fill week.
[03:34.060 --> 03:35.700]  The buds will really start filling in.
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.820]  The trichomes will really start getting dense.
[03:37.820 --> 03:40.460]  This is when the photos really start getting hot.
[03:40.460 --> 03:43.700]  I think weeks 6 through 9 are great for photos.
[03:43.820 --> 03:46.980]  It only gets better as we go on until it is time for harvest.
[03:46.980 --> 03:49.100]  Get out your camera and take some great photos.
[03:49.100 --> 03:51.100]  You are going to get good beefy buds.
[03:51.100 --> 03:52.900]  You are going to get good trichome development.
[03:52.900 --> 03:56.820]  And soon, you are going to start getting those sweet fall colors.
[03:56.820 --> 04:02.820]  Now let's focus in on the environmental conditions for our grow room in week 7 of flower.
[04:02.820 --> 04:06.420]  Our buds are getting big and beefy, so we need to reduce the humidity.
[04:06.420 --> 04:09.740]  If we have too much humidity in the room, we do run the risk of bud rot.
[04:09.740 --> 04:11.780]  We run the risk of powdery mildew.
[04:11.780 --> 04:13.260]  Let's reduce the humidity.
[04:13.260 --> 04:17.780]  Let's bring it down to around 30 or 40% relative humidity in the room.
[04:17.780 --> 04:20.980]  This will help us reduce the risk of bud rot.
[04:20.980 --> 04:26.340]  So the first change is that we should reduce the humidity by 5 to 10% if possible.
[04:26.340 --> 04:32.260]  The next thing I would recommend is to reduce the temperature by just a few degrees if possible.
[04:32.260 --> 04:36.620]  We have been running our flowering room somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees during the day.
[04:36.620 --> 04:40.820]  I would like to knock that down just 3 to 5 degrees if possible.
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.380]  Let's try to get it 77 to 75 degrees in there.
[04:44.380 --> 04:50.100]  And as the weeks go on, I would like to reduce it about 3 to 5 degrees every week until harvest.
[04:50.100 --> 04:52.820]  So this week, let's drop it down by 3 degrees.
[04:52.820 --> 04:56.160]  If you're already at 80 degrees, let's get it down to 77.
[04:56.160 --> 04:59.960]  If you're down at 77, let's crank it down about 75.
[04:59.960 --> 05:02.480]  Let's make these plants think that winter is coming.
[05:02.480 --> 05:05.060]  That colder environment will bring out more colors.
[05:05.060 --> 05:07.500]  That colder environment will bring out more terpenes.
[05:07.500 --> 05:10.020]  That colder environment will make your buds more dense.
[05:10.020 --> 05:13.700]  And I feel like it also speeds up the finishing time of our plants.
[05:13.700 --> 05:17.180]  So let's make it just a little bit colder during week 7.
[05:17.180 --> 05:19.900]  Now let's talk about our nutrients for week 7.
[05:19.900 --> 05:24.080]  This is going to be our last opportunity for feeding our plants.
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.220]  We can start reducing our base nutrients.
[05:26.220 --> 05:30.500]  We don't need as much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as we have in the past.
[05:30.500 --> 05:34.300]  You can almost eliminate the nitrogen at this phase of flowering.
[05:34.300 --> 05:37.900]  We don't want to overfeed them, but we do want to make sure that they get a nice boost
[05:37.900 --> 05:39.380]  for their last feeding.
[05:39.420 --> 05:43.260]  So make sure you include some phosphorus and potassium to make those buds swell.
[05:43.260 --> 05:45.220]  I would also include some CalMag.
[05:45.220 --> 05:48.500]  Don't go too hard on the CalMag at this point because it is really hard to flush it out
[05:48.500 --> 05:52.660]  and you may taste it if you go too hard with CalMag at this point.
[05:52.660 --> 05:56.740]  I would always encourage a kelp product this late in flower that will add to your flavors
[05:56.740 --> 05:57.740]  and aromas.
[05:57.740 --> 06:02.660]  I do like an enzymatic product this late in flower because it keeps my root zone healthy.
[06:02.660 --> 06:06.060]  I also use a microbe product this late in flower.
[06:06.060 --> 06:09.940]  I have mentioned that we should taper off the microbes and start increasing the bloom
[06:09.940 --> 06:15.140]  boosters, but if your budget will allow, I would include microbe products this late in
[06:15.140 --> 06:16.140]  flower.
[06:16.140 --> 06:20.860]  Now, the thing to focus on on this feeding is one final bloom booster feeding.
[06:20.860 --> 06:24.460]  I don't know what product you're using as a bloom booster, but this is probably your
[06:24.460 --> 06:28.600]  last opportunity to add that bloom booster to your nutrient regimen.
[06:28.600 --> 06:30.800]  So make sure you get that in there at this feeding time.
[06:30.800 --> 06:34.300]  This is the last week to fertilize our plants.
[06:34.300 --> 06:36.980]  Next week, we are going to begin the flushing phase.
[06:36.980 --> 06:40.620]  So if you want to boost those plants up one last time, if you've been saving one bottle
[06:40.620 --> 06:45.100]  of something or one little scoop of something, this is the last time to fertilize those plants
[06:45.100 --> 06:50.380]  because at the start of week 8, we are going to begin the flush phase.
[06:50.380 --> 06:53.340]  Now at this point in the game, we've got big fat chunky buds.
[06:53.340 --> 06:57.560]  I shouldn't have to say this, but I want to remind everybody, it is too late to spray
[06:57.560 --> 07:00.180]  any pesticides on these plants.
[07:00.180 --> 07:02.180]  They're coming down in 21 days.
[07:02.180 --> 07:06.660]  We don't want the plants to taste like anything we applied as a pesticide, so please do not
[07:06.660 --> 07:08.140]  spray your plants.
[07:08.140 --> 07:10.940]  Also, do not use a sulfur burner.
[07:10.940 --> 07:13.140]  I've mentioned that in previous episodes.
[07:13.140 --> 07:17.660]  Using a sulfur burner at this point in flower will make your plants taste like total shit.
[07:17.660 --> 07:23.280]  It will taste like smoking a pack of matches, or it will taste like smoking a can of fish.
[07:23.280 --> 07:25.500]  So please turn off the sulfur burner in flower.
[07:25.500 --> 07:28.940]  I wish everybody would just get rid of the sulfur burner and find out what is actually
[07:28.940 --> 07:32.160]  causing the problem and cure the problem.
[07:32.160 --> 07:35.560]  So no pesticides, no sulfur burners this late in flower.
[07:35.560 --> 07:37.760]  What is acceptable is predator bugs.
[07:37.760 --> 07:42.160]  If you have got a pest issue, release an excessive amount of predator bugs.
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.440]  Hopefully you've been on top of that.
[07:43.440 --> 07:47.740]  Hopefully you don't have a problem, but I understand shit happens in cultivation.
[07:47.740 --> 07:51.900]  So predator bugs are the way to go at this stage of the game.
[07:51.900 --> 07:55.920]  The little satchets that you hang, the little teabag looking things, it's too late for those.
[07:55.920 --> 07:59.560]  You need the live predators that are ready to release, that are hungry, that are ready
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.680]  to get in there and destroy your spider mites or whatever pest you may have acquired.
[08:03.680 --> 08:05.320]  You need the live active bugs.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.000]  They're a little more expensive, but they're the only thing that are effective at this
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.560]  stage of flower.
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.140]  So again, do not spray anything.
[08:12.140 --> 08:13.480]  Do not use a sulfur burner.
[08:13.480 --> 08:18.680]  And if you do see any insects, any pests, get in there with some predator bugs and hopefully
[08:18.680 --> 08:21.560]  those predators will eradicate your infestation.
[08:21.560 --> 08:24.020]  Another thing you can do is defoliate.
[08:24.020 --> 08:28.800]  If you do see any signs of pests, remove any infested leaves, mark the plant so that you
[08:28.800 --> 08:31.880]  know where that infestation was and come check frequently.
[08:31.880 --> 08:35.640]  Do what you can to minimize the problem in that area.
[08:35.640 --> 08:40.840]  At this point in the game, I also suggest you defoliate any yellow or funky leaves.
[08:40.840 --> 08:43.780]  Any leaves that look unhealthy are pest attractants.
[08:43.780 --> 08:47.040]  So get those dead funky leaves out of the grow.
[08:47.040 --> 08:49.720]  Defoliate anything that is obvious that needs to come off.
[08:49.720 --> 08:52.720]  If you've got some nice fall looking colors and you want to leave those pretty leaves
[08:52.720 --> 08:54.580]  on there for photos, you can do that.
[08:54.580 --> 08:58.720]  But the minute it starts getting crunchy and it is dead, decaying matter, it needs to come
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.720]  off of the plant.
[08:59.720 --> 09:02.920]  It is okay to have a few dead leaves at this point in the game.
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.360]  We've got a full grow, we've got a full canopy, we've got a lot of space.
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.160]  There will be some dead funky leaves in the garden.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.240]  Sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough light.
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.560]  Sometimes a branch gets bumped.
[09:12.560 --> 09:13.560]  Things will happen.
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.900]  You will have some funky leaves.
[09:14.900 --> 09:15.900]  Don't freak out.
[09:15.900 --> 09:19.120]  If it is excessive, you may have a problem that needs to be diagnosed.
[09:19.120 --> 09:22.880]  But a few funky leaves at this stage are not a problem.
[09:22.880 --> 09:26.660]  Now another thing we should keep our eyes open for at this stage of the game are late
[09:26.660 --> 09:29.020]  flower hermaphrodites.
[09:29.020 --> 09:31.140]  You should be scouting daily for pests.
[09:31.140 --> 09:34.340]  You should be scouting daily for powdery mildew and boetritus.
[09:34.340 --> 09:38.980]  During that visual inspection, you should also be looking for hermaphrodites.
[09:38.980 --> 09:40.740]  Look at the top buds of the plants.
[09:40.740 --> 09:44.220]  Look at the middle buds of the plants and definitely look at the lower part of the plant
[09:44.220 --> 09:46.500]  where you were not getting a lot of light.
[09:46.500 --> 09:49.160]  Do you see any male flowers?
[09:49.160 --> 09:51.580]  Do you know what a male flower looks like?
[09:51.580 --> 09:56.620]  Could you identify a hermaphrodite flower if it walked up and bit you on the nose?
[09:56.620 --> 10:00.740]  If not, I recommend you do a little bit of Google research and know what a hermaphrodite
[10:00.740 --> 10:05.220]  flower looks like so you do not allow them to happen in your garden.
[10:05.220 --> 10:09.500]  So at this point of the game, we still need to keep our eyes open for pests and mold problems
[10:09.500 --> 10:13.220]  and we also need to keep an eye out for hermaphrodites.
[10:13.220 --> 10:17.620]  Now I've spoken in a previous episode about how to handle the herms if you should get
[10:17.620 --> 10:18.620]  one.
[10:18.620 --> 10:19.620]  Don't freak out.
[10:19.620 --> 10:20.620]  Don't go crazy.
[10:20.620 --> 10:22.580]  Spray it with some water and think of your options.
[10:22.580 --> 10:24.540]  Do you want to remove the male flower?
[10:24.540 --> 10:25.860]  Do you want to remove the bud?
[10:25.860 --> 10:27.140]  Do you want to remove the branch?
[10:27.140 --> 10:28.980]  Or do you want to get rid of that whole plant?
[10:28.980 --> 10:30.060]  It is up to you.
[10:30.060 --> 10:31.100]  It is your garden.
[10:31.100 --> 10:33.420]  You're going to have to make decisions like that.
[10:33.420 --> 10:36.940]  If there is just one little hermaphrodite flower, I would spray it with water, pick
[10:36.940 --> 10:38.220]  it out with tweezers.
[10:38.220 --> 10:42.400]  If you've got two or three that are on one bud, maybe cut that bud or that branch off.
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.340]  If you've got several hermaphrodite flowers popping up in different spots on a plant,
[10:46.340 --> 10:48.460]  it may be time to get rid of that plant.
[10:48.460 --> 10:52.900]  You have a lot of things to think about because this late in flower, will those male flowers
[10:52.900 --> 10:54.860]  do anything to the rest of your crop?
[10:54.860 --> 10:59.340]  If you're just running one flowering cycle, you're probably too late into the grow to
[10:59.340 --> 11:00.460]  seed anything.
[11:00.460 --> 11:04.580]  If you've got a perpetual cycle going on, those plants that are earlier in flower may
[11:04.580 --> 11:08.300]  be ready to receive that pollen should that hermaphrodite release pollen.
[11:08.300 --> 11:10.460]  So you've got things to think about.
[11:10.460 --> 11:14.380]  Now if you do have a hermaphroditic plant in your grow room, don't give clones of that
[11:14.380 --> 11:15.540]  to anybody.
[11:15.540 --> 11:18.540]  Please don't pass out hermaphrodite clones to your friends.
[11:18.540 --> 11:22.600]  If you want to continue to grow it, that is fine, but don't give a herm out to anybody.
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.280]  You're setting them up for failure.
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.200]  We don't want to do that to our friends and fellow growers.
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.140]  Now the last things I have written down for week seven is plenty of airflow.
[11:31.140 --> 11:35.080]  We need a lot of airflow in the grow room as these buds start getting chunkier.
[11:35.080 --> 11:36.700]  We may need more fans.
[11:36.700 --> 11:38.440]  I want to see every leaf move.
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.760]  I don't need every plant and every leaf getting beat down by the wind, but I want every leaf
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.080]  just to get a little rustle occasionally.
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.060]  As the fans oscillate, I want every fan to just feel that fresh air.
[11:49.060 --> 11:50.800]  Just change that air around my leaves.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.940]  That way I know the environment is getting shuffled.
[11:52.940 --> 11:54.800]  We don't have a bunch of CO2 in one area.
[11:54.800 --> 11:57.020]  We don't have a bunch of humidity packed up over here.
[11:57.020 --> 12:01.000]  I want to mix that air all day long and keep that air fresh for my plants.
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.600]  So have plenty of airflow in your grow as we get late into flower.
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.760]  Now the next thing I want to talk about is kind of preparing us for the future.
[12:09.760 --> 12:13.680]  We plan to cut this crop down in approximately 21 days.
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.740]  Do you have seeds or clones prepared for your next run?
[12:17.740 --> 12:22.520]  If you have another grow space, now is the time to get your seeds or clones prepared
[12:22.700 --> 12:23.960]  for your next run.
[12:23.960 --> 12:26.100]  That way we don't have a bunch of downtime.
[12:26.100 --> 12:29.720]  That way as soon as these plants are harvested, you can move fresh plants right into that
[12:29.720 --> 12:32.120]  grow room and never miss a day.
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.460]  In the future, I do plan on updating my perpetual grow lesson.
[12:35.460 --> 12:38.780]  I did write a very long perpetual grow podcast.
[12:38.780 --> 12:41.020]  I think it is episode 73.
[12:41.020 --> 12:44.980]  So if you're interested in scheduling a perpetual grow, go check out episode 73.
[12:44.980 --> 12:49.520]  But I will update that because in Colorado we have made quite a few changes to our laws.
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.660]  I want to write a perpetual grow episode based around our Colorado plant count limits.
[12:54.660 --> 12:56.400]  So that is coming in the future.
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.240]  But let's focus on today.
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.260]  You need to get plants prepared for your next run if you have got an available veg space.
[13:04.260 --> 13:08.740]  So now's the time to buy clones or acquire clones from either your fellow growers or
[13:08.740 --> 13:10.660]  a dispensary or however you get them.
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.820]  Or now is the time to start germinating seeds and getting them started so that when that
[13:14.820 --> 13:18.940]  grow room is empty, we can clean it up and we can refill it and you never miss a day
[13:18.960 --> 13:19.960]  in there.
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.840]  So that is the basics of week seven of the flowering cycle.
[13:22.840 --> 13:24.800]  Let's move right into week eight.
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.260]  In week eight, we want to continue to reduce the temperature and humidity.
[13:29.260 --> 13:33.360]  Let's get that humidity down between 25 and 35% relative humidity.
[13:33.360 --> 13:36.840]  This will make it a little bit dry in the room for the last two weeks, but it will also
[13:36.840 --> 13:39.680]  help us prevent powdery mildew and boetritis.
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.640]  We don't want to get mold right up the center of our big giant buds.
[13:43.640 --> 13:45.480]  So let's start by reducing the humidity.
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.540]  The next thing we can do is we can reduce the temperature by three to five degrees.
[13:50.540 --> 13:55.660]  At this point of the phase, I would like to be somewhere between 70 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit
[13:55.660 --> 13:57.800]  during the lights on cycle.
[13:57.800 --> 14:01.040]  Now week eight is what I call the final swell week.
[14:01.040 --> 14:02.760]  You will see your buds take off.
[14:02.760 --> 14:03.760]  They will get huge.
[14:03.760 --> 14:04.760]  They will get chunky.
[14:04.760 --> 14:07.380]  They will start becoming covered in trichomes.
[14:07.380 --> 14:13.380]  It is time to really start paying attention to your trichomes with a 60 or 100X powered
[14:13.380 --> 14:14.380]  microscope.
[14:14.380 --> 14:18.100]  You need to get in there and look at those trichome heads, see what color they are.
[14:18.100 --> 14:19.180]  Are they clear?
[14:19.180 --> 14:21.260]  Are they getting that milky whitish blue color?
[14:21.260 --> 14:23.420]  Have they started becoming amber?
[14:23.420 --> 14:26.640]  That is how you determine the ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.260]  So it's time to get in there and start paying close attention to the trichomes on our cannabis
[14:31.260 --> 14:32.260]  plants.
[14:32.260 --> 14:36.620]  Now these plants are also going to be super sticky and super stinky, but they should also
[14:36.620 --> 14:39.040]  be putting off some amazing colors.
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.480]  So now is another great opportunity to take more photography.
[14:43.580 --> 14:47.360]  As we enter the flush phase, we will start seeing more colors come from the plants.
[14:47.360 --> 14:49.760]  We're going to start removing nutrients from the plants.
[14:49.760 --> 14:51.400]  We're going to push some of the color out.
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.120]  Some of the green is going to disappear, which will allow room for reds and golds and a lot
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.320]  of great colors that you didn't know were coming from these plants.
[14:58.320 --> 15:01.040]  This is going to be an exciting two weeks.
[15:01.040 --> 15:02.360]  So we've reduced the humidity.
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.880]  We have reduced the temperature.
[15:03.880 --> 15:06.480]  Now let's start flushing our plants.
[15:06.480 --> 15:08.080]  Flushing is free.
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.080]  I have done an entire episode on flushing our cannabis plants.
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.520]  It is episode 320.
[15:12.560 --> 15:14.760]  I go into great detail.
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.920]  Quickly here, I will explain how and why we flush.
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.520]  For the past at least nine weeks, we have been shoving nutrients into these plants.
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.640]  They are filled with a lot of nutrients.
[15:23.640 --> 15:25.920]  We do not want to smoke all of those nutrients.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.200]  They are stored in the buds.
[15:27.200 --> 15:29.000]  They are stored within that plant.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.540]  By flushing the plant, we are starving it of nutrients.
[15:31.540 --> 15:35.960]  We will make that plant use up all of the nutrients stored within its systems.
[15:35.960 --> 15:39.120]  We will also remove all of the nutrients from the soil.
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.880]  We basically want to wash out the medium to make no nutrients available to allow that
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.000]  plant to starve itself so that it will use up all of the nutrients that is stored over
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.760]  its flowering cycle.
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.440]  By removing the nutrients from all of the buds, it will make the buds burn and smoke
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.320]  and taste much better if they are properly dried and cured.
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.000]  We still need to get all the way through a harvest and dry and cure phase, but at this
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.480]  point, flushing is the first step to getting a tasty final product.
[16:06.480 --> 16:08.080]  So let's start flushing.
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.160]  Flushing is very easy.
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.840]  When you water the plants, don't add any nutrients.
[16:11.840 --> 16:16.720]  You can adjust the pH somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5 and just water the plants until you
[16:16.720 --> 16:18.720]  get 20% runoff.
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.640]  If you pour in a gallon of water in a pot, you want 20% of that gallon to run right out
[16:23.640 --> 16:25.200]  of the bottom of that pot.
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.120]  So give them a few heavy waterings and you will wash out all of those nutrients.
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.420]  Then, just continue to water until harvest time.
[16:32.420 --> 16:33.420]  That is flushing.
[16:33.420 --> 16:37.940]  Flushing is simple and it is free and it will make your plants taste so much better
[16:37.940 --> 16:40.020]  if you do it correctly.
[16:40.020 --> 16:44.100]  Have you ever smoked flowers that taste like you just stuck your tongue in a light socket?
[16:44.100 --> 16:47.280]  Chances are, those buds were not flushed properly.
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.680]  That person did not allow a 10-14 day flush phase before he harvested his plants and now
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.820]  they taste like complete shit.
[16:54.820 --> 16:55.820]  Flush your plants.
[16:55.820 --> 16:56.820]  I've said it a couple times already.
[16:56.820 --> 16:57.820]  It is free.
[16:57.820 --> 16:59.980]  Why don't you want to do free shit to your plants?
[16:59.980 --> 17:02.820]  You don't have to use nutrients and it saves time.
[17:02.820 --> 17:05.900]  All you have to do is fill the container with water, adjust the pH, pour it on the
[17:05.900 --> 17:06.900]  damn plants.
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.420]  Let's flush the plants.
[17:08.420 --> 17:14.020]  That is what we are going to focus on in weeks 8-9 is flushing the plants for harvest so
[17:14.020 --> 17:17.340]  that they taste good once we dry and cure them.
[17:17.340 --> 17:21.140]  Before I harvest, I like to do a pre-harvest defoliation.
[17:21.140 --> 17:25.260]  I generally like to do this 7-10 days before harvest.
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.540]  So that may happen in the middle of week 8 or at the beginning of week 9.
[17:29.540 --> 17:33.300]  Any leaf that has a petiole that I can grab, I just go in there and peel it right off.
[17:33.300 --> 17:36.300]  I don't need a bunch of leaves at this point of the flowering phase.
[17:36.300 --> 17:37.300]  Those leaves have done their job.
[17:37.300 --> 17:39.380]  It is almost time to cut down these plants.
[17:39.380 --> 17:42.260]  I want to make the harvest cruise job just a little bit easier.
[17:42.260 --> 17:47.980]  So I like to go through and pull off all of the big leaves 7-10 days before harvest.
[17:47.980 --> 17:52.260]  Now that is a good way to segue us right into week number 9.
[17:52.260 --> 17:55.980]  At the beginning of week 9, if you haven't done it already, feel free to go in there
[17:55.980 --> 17:58.500]  and pull off all of the big leaves.
[17:58.500 --> 17:59.940]  Those leaves have done their jobs.
[17:59.940 --> 18:01.260]  We don't need them anymore.
[18:01.260 --> 18:04.100]  Let's take them off of there and get them out of the room.
[18:04.100 --> 18:08.740]  Now let's talk about the environmental conditions in our grow room for week 9.
[18:08.740 --> 18:12.460]  This is the final week of our flowering phase.
[18:12.460 --> 18:19.260]  I like to reduce the humidity to approximately 25-30% humidity at the end of the flowering phase.
[18:19.260 --> 18:20.260]  My buds are huge.
[18:20.260 --> 18:21.260]  My buds are chunky.
[18:21.260 --> 18:25.240]  I do not want to risk bud rot in the middle of those buds.
[18:25.240 --> 18:30.920]  So I reduce that humidity down to about 25% relative humidity in my flowering room.
[18:30.920 --> 18:33.280]  I also like to get it nice and cool.
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.840]  If I can get it about 70-74 degrees for the last week of flower, that really will make
[18:38.840 --> 18:40.720]  the colors pop out of the plants.
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.720]  It will make them more dense and it will give you more trichomes.
[18:43.720 --> 18:47.640]  And I really think the plants pack on a little beef once it gets colder and it will also
[18:47.640 --> 18:48.960]  speed them up.
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.820]  I feel like making it nice and cold at the end of the season tricks our plants into believing
[18:52.820 --> 18:53.960]  it is fall.
[18:53.960 --> 18:54.960]  Winter is coming.
[18:55.680 --> 18:57.160]  They say, oh I do not have a lot of time left to live.
[18:57.160 --> 19:01.920]  So they really start doing everything they can do to ripen up and reach the end of their life cycle.
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.960]  So that is why I try to make it a little colder in the grow room at the end of the grow cycle.
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.320]  Another thing that a lot of growers like to do at the end of a flowering cycle is reduce
[19:11.320 --> 19:12.320]  the lights.
[19:12.320 --> 19:15.840]  Currently, you are probably running 12 on and 12 off.
[19:15.840 --> 19:21.760]  Toward the end of the flowering cycle, you can always reduce it to 10 on and 14 off.
[19:21.760 --> 19:25.360]  Reducing your light cycle will also make the plants think that the end is near.
[19:25.360 --> 19:28.480]  They will speed up a little bit and they will finish more quickly.
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.200]  I think that having it a little bit cooler and having a little less light in the room
[19:32.200 --> 19:34.160]  makes the plants finish a little sooner.
[19:34.160 --> 19:36.760]  It also makes them pack on a little more trichomes.
[19:36.760 --> 19:38.520]  It makes the buds a little more dense.
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.760]  And also, I think it gives us a little more terpene presence.
[19:42.760 --> 19:44.400]  Terpenes are destroyed by light.
[19:44.400 --> 19:46.040]  Terpenes are destroyed by warmth.
[19:46.040 --> 19:50.580]  Why not give them a little cool and a little dark and we can have a little more terps.
[19:50.580 --> 19:52.260]  And we're also saving a little bit of money.
[19:52.260 --> 19:54.620]  We're not using nutrients because we're flushing.
[19:54.620 --> 19:56.980]  And now we're running the lights for two hours less per day.
[19:56.980 --> 19:58.620]  So we're saving electricity.
[19:58.620 --> 20:00.820]  We're saving the electricity on running the bulbs.
[20:00.820 --> 20:04.020]  Plus we're probably saving a little bit of electricity on cooling since we don't have
[20:04.020 --> 20:05.740]  to cool to fight those lights.
[20:05.740 --> 20:09.460]  So we're saving electricity and we're also saving time on our gear.
[20:09.460 --> 20:13.900]  So why not reduce the lights just a couple of hours at the last week of flower?
[20:13.900 --> 20:16.460]  Now here's a little secret that I haven't shared with a lot of people.
[20:16.460 --> 20:20.580]  If you've got a plant that takes way too long to flower and you need to speed it up
[20:20.580 --> 20:25.300]  just a little bit, you can reduce those lights by four hours at the end of flowering.
[20:25.300 --> 20:29.020]  And those plants will finish approximately a week earlier.
[20:29.020 --> 20:33.460]  If you've got a 10 week strain or an 11 week strain, and at the end of week nine, you crank
[20:33.460 --> 20:39.160]  those lights down to eight hours on at 16 hours off, that plant will finish one solid
[20:39.160 --> 20:40.160]  week early.
[20:40.160 --> 20:43.900]  Now you may not get the harvest weight you would get if you let it go for that full 11
[20:43.900 --> 20:45.260]  or 12 week period.
[20:45.260 --> 20:47.800]  But sometimes we just need the plants to be done.
[20:47.800 --> 20:48.860]  We need that space.
[20:48.860 --> 20:49.860]  We need that room.
[20:49.860 --> 20:53.500]  So that is always a trick you can use to speed up some plants.
[20:53.500 --> 20:54.760]  So we have reduced humidity.
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.100]  We have reduced our temperatures.
[20:56.100 --> 20:58.000]  Now we have reduced our light cycle.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.040]  We are on the final home stretch here in week nine.
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.040]  Keep flushing.
[21:02.040 --> 21:03.040]  Don't add any nutrients.
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.140]  Obviously, please do not apply any pesticides or any foliar feeds to your plants this late
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.140]  in flower.
[21:09.140 --> 21:10.140]  You will taste it.
[21:10.140 --> 21:11.140]  You will notice it.
[21:11.140 --> 21:12.420]  It will ruin the entire crop.
[21:12.420 --> 21:15.300]  This week is our final bulking and ripening week.
[21:15.300 --> 21:17.260]  You will see that final bulk come on.
[21:17.260 --> 21:18.900]  They'll start getting fat and chunky.
[21:18.900 --> 21:21.700]  All of your leaves are going to start getting yellow and starting to droop down and get
[21:21.700 --> 21:24.060]  a little crinkly because we've been flushing.
[21:24.060 --> 21:28.020]  And hopefully you're paying attention to those trichomes because this is when the trichomes
[21:28.020 --> 21:31.760]  are really going to start turning amber and showing their progress.
[21:31.760 --> 21:34.140]  So week nine is the bulk and ripen week.
[21:34.140 --> 21:37.020]  It is almost time to chop down the plants.
[21:37.020 --> 21:38.820]  So keep a close eye on the trichomes.
[21:38.820 --> 21:39.980]  We have been flushing.
[21:39.980 --> 21:44.020]  If you decide the plants are not done and you want to let them go a little bit longer,
[21:44.020 --> 21:49.280]  you can let them flower for an extra week and you don't have to give them any more nutrients.
[21:49.280 --> 21:53.020]  Don't mess your whole cycle up by adding nutrients in and then trying to cut it down seven days
[21:53.020 --> 21:54.020]  later.
[21:54.020 --> 21:55.020]  You've already been flushing.
[21:55.020 --> 21:56.660]  You're already doing it perfectly.
[21:56.660 --> 21:57.820]  Don't mess it up now.
[21:57.820 --> 22:00.840]  If it needs to go longer, let it go longer.
[22:00.840 --> 22:05.980]  If you are early in flower and you anticipate you may need an extra week or two, again,
[22:05.980 --> 22:08.460]  repeat my advice from week seven.
[22:08.460 --> 22:13.260]  Week seven is where you extend your schedule if you're going to go longer than three weeks.
[22:13.260 --> 22:15.060]  So let's act like we're right on schedule.
[22:15.060 --> 22:16.600]  We're ending up week nine.
[22:16.600 --> 22:17.980]  We have defoliated the plants.
[22:17.980 --> 22:19.740]  We haven't ran into any problems.
[22:19.740 --> 22:25.840]  The next thing to think about is do you have your harvest and drying and curing area prepared?
[22:25.840 --> 22:31.160]  Are you ready for a sticky, stinky, time consuming and space consuming harvest?
[22:31.160 --> 22:34.460]  When you cut down the plants, where are you going to hang them?
[22:34.460 --> 22:38.860]  They're going to be there for at least a week, maybe seven to 14 days, depending on
[22:38.860 --> 22:40.000]  your environment.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.400]  Do you have space for that?
[22:41.400 --> 22:42.400]  Is it secure?
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.400]  Is it safe?
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.800]  Will people be showing up?
[22:44.800 --> 22:48.700]  When people show up, are they going to smell your hanging plants?
[22:48.700 --> 22:52.320]  Do you need to plan ahead to keep that aroma away from visitors?
[22:52.320 --> 22:56.860]  Do you need to do something to keep intruders and thieves away from that harvested product?
[22:56.860 --> 22:59.200]  Now is the time to start thinking about that.
[22:59.200 --> 23:02.200]  You don't want to say, hey, it's the time to cut down these plants and walk in there
[23:02.200 --> 23:04.700]  with scissors and cut them down and then you're stuck.
[23:04.700 --> 23:05.900]  You don't know what to do.
[23:05.900 --> 23:08.460]  Start thinking about that now.
[23:08.460 --> 23:12.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next step in my grow lessons is harvest.
[23:12.120 --> 23:14.460]  Our next step is to harvest these plants.
[23:14.460 --> 23:16.620]  That is only followed by drying and curing.
[23:16.620 --> 23:20.380]  The next step after that is to clean and reset our grow rooms.
[23:20.380 --> 23:25.060]  If you've made it this far, you are one episode from cutting down your plants.
[23:25.060 --> 23:27.860]  Then after that, all we've got to do is dry it and cure it.
[23:27.880 --> 23:32.880]  The step after that is finally sampling our finished product.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of you.
[23:34.080 --> 23:37.920]  I hope you've made it all the way through nine weeks of flowering without any issues.
[23:37.920 --> 23:41.560]  If you did run into issues, I hope you were able to solve those problems without messing
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.620]  up your crop.
