[00:01.150 --> 00:22.010]  All right, here we go.
[00:22.010 --> 00:23.650]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:23.650 --> 00:25.370]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.370 --> 00:30.210]  This is episode 791 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.210 --> 00:32.330]  I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[00:32.330 --> 00:35.230]  In this episode, I'm going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:35.230 --> 00:40.970]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of irigenetic seeds.
[00:40.970 --> 00:43.530]  We'll talk more about that later in this episode.
[00:43.530 --> 00:47.290]  Before we get too far, I do want to remind you that I will be at the Dude Grows Cup this
[00:47.290 --> 00:48.290]  year.
[00:48.290 --> 00:51.870]  That's right, June 3rd, we are doing the Dude Grows Cup in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[00:51.870 --> 00:55.770]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all the information.
[00:55.770 --> 01:00.010]  I also want to send a big thank you shout out to everybody who participated in the sale
[01:00.010 --> 01:01.010]  on iRedirect.
[01:01.010 --> 01:03.170]  I did a big sale over the past week.
[01:03.170 --> 01:06.890]  A lot of people got a lot of great deals, a lot of great orders, and it took me a little
[01:06.890 --> 01:08.690]  bit of time to get all those packages out.
[01:08.690 --> 01:10.370]  I do apologize for that.
[01:10.370 --> 01:12.030]  All of the orders have been sent by now.
[01:12.030 --> 01:13.630]  You should have a tracking number.
[01:13.630 --> 01:16.990]  Many of the orders have landed by the time this episode comes out.
[01:16.990 --> 01:18.490]  Thank you for all of the support.
[01:18.490 --> 01:22.750]  If you want to stay informed, stay up to date, know about the next sale, the next drop, the
[01:22.750 --> 01:25.030]  easiest way to do it is to join the newsletter.
[01:25.030 --> 01:30.110]  If you go to iRegenetics.com or iRedirect.com and you scroll down toward the bottom of the
[01:30.110 --> 01:35.150]  page, there's a tab where it says stay in touch or stay updated with iRegenetics.
[01:35.150 --> 01:38.910]  Type in your email address, hit return, that will add you to my newsletter.
[01:39.470 --> 01:43.470]  When I do a new drop, when I do updates, when I add new inventory, of course you will be
[01:43.470 --> 01:47.630]  notified of that stuff on iRedirect via the newsletter.
[01:47.630 --> 01:52.030]  Also, the people on Patreon do get first dibs when I do a sale.
[01:52.030 --> 01:55.110]  The higher the tier, the better the heads up you're going to get, sometimes the better
[01:55.110 --> 01:56.510]  coupon code.
[01:56.510 --> 02:00.030]  This time they got the first heads up that deals were coming, then they also got free
[02:00.030 --> 02:02.830]  shipping so maybe join the Patreon.
[02:02.830 --> 02:04.110]  Definitely join the newsletter.
[02:04.110 --> 02:06.630]  If nothing else, do of course join the Discord.
[02:06.630 --> 02:07.630]  The Discord is free.
[02:07.630 --> 02:08.630]  The newsletter is free.
[02:08.950 --> 02:09.950]  Come hang out.
[02:09.950 --> 02:10.950]  I do encourage that.
[02:10.950 --> 02:14.830]  Also, I want to announce that we've done some changes on iRedirect.
[02:14.830 --> 02:18.750]  By the time this episode comes out, all the web updates will have been done.
[02:18.750 --> 02:23.430]  We have now got a tiered giveaway system so the more seeds you buy, the more freebies
[02:23.430 --> 02:24.430]  you will get.
[02:24.430 --> 02:27.710]  We make it very clear and it's indicated on your shopping cart which freebies come with
[02:27.710 --> 02:28.710]  your orders.
[02:28.710 --> 02:29.710]  It's right there on the screen.
[02:29.710 --> 02:31.150]  If you spend this much, you will get this.
[02:31.150 --> 02:34.030]  If you spend this much, I'll give you this and this.
[02:34.030 --> 02:35.150]  Those do stack, by the way.
[02:35.150 --> 02:39.150]  If you spend $100, you get the freebie for $30 and the freebie for $100.
[02:39.150 --> 02:45.630]  If you spend $200, I think you get a freebie at $25, $100, $150, and $200.
[02:45.630 --> 02:47.670]  I think there's a $250 tier also.
[02:47.670 --> 02:48.670]  Yes, there is.
[02:48.670 --> 02:54.230]  If you spend $250 on iRedirect at this time, you actually get a free 10-pack of Big Mountain
[02:54.230 --> 02:58.150]  Fudge Cake along with a few other freebies that will come with that.
[02:58.150 --> 03:01.310]  That is my ramble on the updates on iRedirect.com.
[03:01.310 --> 03:03.270]  Make sure you join the Patreon.
[03:03.270 --> 03:04.430]  Sign up for the newsletter.
[03:04.430 --> 03:08.190]  Check out the Discord and then also look for the new freebies on iRedirect.
[03:08.190 --> 03:12.350]  I know that's a lot to ask from you right here at the start of the show, but it's a
[03:12.350 --> 03:13.350]  good deal.
[03:13.350 --> 03:14.350]  You will appreciate it.
[03:14.350 --> 03:15.350]  All right.
[03:15.350 --> 03:16.350]  That's a lot of rambling.
[03:16.350 --> 03:18.430]  Let's work my way into the email portion of today's podcast.
[03:18.430 --> 03:21.290]  I've got a couple of great emails here in front of me.
[03:21.290 --> 03:23.350]  The first one comes from our friend.
[03:23.350 --> 03:24.550]  They want their name said on there.
[03:24.550 --> 03:25.910]  I'm not sure they want their whole name.
[03:25.910 --> 03:26.910]  Oh, they do.
[03:26.910 --> 03:29.010]  They want High Off Kebabs to be their name on the show.
[03:29.010 --> 03:31.630]  Big shout out to High Off Kebabs.
[03:31.630 --> 03:36.030]  First of all, let me give you a big congratulations because in the last episode I said that if
[03:36.030 --> 03:41.230]  I read your message from the Grow Questions submissions tab on the website, if you send
[03:41.230 --> 03:44.590]  a question there and I do read that, that you will win a free pack of seeds.
[03:44.590 --> 03:48.350]  So High Off Kebabs, send me your address because I do owe you a free pack of seeds.
[03:48.350 --> 03:52.510]  Of course, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by seedsherenow.com.
[03:52.510 --> 03:54.790]  Shout out to the crew at seedsherenow.com.
[03:54.790 --> 03:57.110]  So our friend High Off Kebabs did send a Grow Question.
[03:57.110 --> 03:58.110]  It goes a lot like this.
[03:58.110 --> 04:01.510]  It says, Ross DeJeff, bless your soul, brother.
[04:01.510 --> 04:03.350]  Big respect, many blessings back at you, brother.
[04:03.350 --> 04:06.350]  It says, I picked up the blueberry butcher regular seeds.
[04:06.350 --> 04:08.230]  I've planted all 10 of them.
[04:08.230 --> 04:09.470]  Sounds like you're about to have a party, bro.
[04:09.470 --> 04:10.990]  And thanks for grabbing the blueberry butchers.
[04:10.990 --> 04:13.590]  It says, they are in the vegetative stage.
[04:13.590 --> 04:15.350]  Some are bushy and some are taller.
[04:15.350 --> 04:17.990]  Yes, that is a phenotypical expression.
[04:17.990 --> 04:19.390]  You'll see that amongst the population.
[04:19.390 --> 04:23.110]  That is very common, especially amongst the F1 filial generation.
[04:23.110 --> 04:27.990]  It says, they are 10 to 24 inches tall on average.
[04:28.030 --> 04:31.630]  I'm going to take clones from each one and then flip them to flower.
[04:31.630 --> 04:32.630]  That is a great strategy.
[04:32.630 --> 04:33.470]  I recommend that.
[04:33.470 --> 04:37.430]  Take a clone from everything before you flower it because you may have the most
[04:37.430 --> 04:39.230]  amazing cannabis you've ever grown there.
[04:39.430 --> 04:40.390]  It may be your favorite.
[04:40.390 --> 04:42.750]  It might be the plant that does the thing you need done.
[04:42.990 --> 04:45.430]  And if you don't have a clone of it, it'd be really heartbreaking to know that
[04:45.430 --> 04:48.070]  that jar will be empty someday and you can't reproduce it.
[04:48.350 --> 04:49.470]  So always take a clone.
[04:49.470 --> 04:50.390]  That is my strategy.
[04:50.390 --> 04:51.270]  That is my preaching.
[04:51.550 --> 04:52.110]  Then it goes on.
[04:52.110 --> 04:54.390]  It says, how would I do this?
[04:54.390 --> 04:55.510]  That's a very good question.
[04:55.510 --> 04:58.910]  It said, how would I control the males from not throwing pollen?
[04:59.030 --> 05:02.430]  How long would it take for a novice grower to realize the males?
[05:02.590 --> 05:05.390]  And then there's a little bit more details we'll talk about later on in this.
[05:05.630 --> 05:06.750]  So this is a great question.
[05:06.750 --> 05:09.190]  We can talk very in depth about this one.
[05:09.510 --> 05:14.150]  This is basically about doing, cutting clones to do some sexing and not
[05:14.150 --> 05:16.190]  contaminating the rest of the grow with pollen.
[05:16.190 --> 05:17.870]  So let's talk about this.
[05:18.190 --> 05:18.470]  All right.
[05:18.470 --> 05:21.510]  So it sounds like you've got a good idea of what you were doing already, and you
[05:21.510 --> 05:24.790]  were already onto a good path of being successful with this.
[05:25.070 --> 05:29.790]  The plants are 10 to 24 inches tall on average, which means by the time this
[05:29.790 --> 05:32.910]  episode comes out, it will be time to get clones from these plants.
[05:33.150 --> 05:34.150]  So how do we do this?
[05:34.430 --> 05:35.630]  Very simply grow them.
[05:35.630 --> 05:36.590]  You've got them in your pots.
[05:36.590 --> 05:37.550]  You've got them under lights.
[05:37.550 --> 05:38.110]  They're growing.
[05:38.110 --> 05:39.830]  They're going to keep producing branches.
[05:40.110 --> 05:43.790]  I would recommend taking three clones from each plant.
[05:43.790 --> 05:45.070]  That's going to be 30 cuts.
[05:45.430 --> 05:48.110]  If legally and everything is that's possible for you.
[05:48.310 --> 05:50.910]  I recommend taking three clones from each plant.
[05:51.470 --> 05:55.230]  There's going to be one really healthy clone at the top of the plant, that main
[05:55.230 --> 05:57.150]  top, I would make that the clone.
[05:57.150 --> 05:58.830]  That's always my favorite clone.
[05:59.150 --> 06:02.110]  Then I always clean up the bottom branches off of my plants.
[06:02.110 --> 06:04.550]  If you've got a couple of good, healthy branches there on the bottom,
[06:04.790 --> 06:06.030]  make two clones out of those.
[06:06.030 --> 06:08.030]  Now you've got three clones from every plant.
[06:08.470 --> 06:10.790]  I use, I can make clones in an easy cloner.
[06:10.790 --> 06:14.510]  I can make clones in the little root riot plugs with the dome over it.
[06:14.710 --> 06:18.910]  I'm pretty proficient at making clones in just about any style that needs to be done.
[06:18.910 --> 06:23.310]  However, when I do clone making videos, YouTube doesn't like it and they take them
[06:23.310 --> 06:23.670]  down.
[06:23.670 --> 06:26.310]  So I can tell you briefly how I do clones.
[06:26.550 --> 06:28.230]  I wait till the plants are nice and healthy.
[06:28.230 --> 06:30.510]  And then I cut them at a 45 degree angle.
[06:30.710 --> 06:34.830]  I dip it in a, I use the, uh, the clone X gel, the purple stuff.
[06:34.830 --> 06:39.630]  I use that wear gloves when he used that always cut it at a 45 degree angle, dip
[06:39.630 --> 06:40.470]  it in the clone X.
[06:40.670 --> 06:43.350]  And then if you're going into an easy cloner, all you got to do is put it in
[06:43.350 --> 06:46.550]  the collar and then make sure the water in the easy cloner is appropriate.
[06:46.670 --> 06:52.070]  I use a EC of 1.1 with the easy cloner, uh, the clone X, uh, the liquid solution,
[06:52.070 --> 06:52.790]  the yellow one.
[06:52.910 --> 06:57.110]  And then I will adjust the pH to about six, one, six, two, and then I will set it
[06:57.110 --> 06:57.870]  and forget it.
[06:57.870 --> 07:01.310]  Sometimes if, uh, I know it's in a warm room, sometimes I'll add some of the, uh,
[07:01.310 --> 07:03.870]  what's the product that prevents the algae from growing in there.
[07:04.070 --> 07:05.430]  Can't even think of the name clear rez.
[07:05.430 --> 07:08.470]  I knew when I gave up, it would popped into my head at some clear rez in there
[07:08.470 --> 07:10.150]  once every five to seven days ish.
[07:10.350 --> 07:11.390]  And just let it rock.
[07:11.630 --> 07:15.230]  Uh, maybe add some water in there a few days later, and that cloner should rock
[07:15.230 --> 07:20.030]  for you, uh, or clip it, dip it, and then stick it into the, uh, rapid router.
[07:20.190 --> 07:21.630]  And then I feed those rapid routers.
[07:21.630 --> 07:24.790]  I spray them actually to keep them nice and wet, but not too soggy.
[07:25.070 --> 07:30.510]  Uh, put the, uh, the cloning solution, the same solution, 1.1, uh, clone X at a pH
[07:30.510 --> 07:32.990]  of about 6.2, shake it up real good.
[07:32.990 --> 07:35.590]  Spray the root riot plugs or the rapid router plugs.
[07:35.590 --> 07:37.750]  So there, so get those nice and appropriately wet.
[07:37.750 --> 07:39.110]  I spray them with the spray bottle.
[07:39.310 --> 07:42.630]  Uh, I dip the clone and the clone X solution that pop it right in there.
[07:42.750 --> 07:44.510]  I spray the underside of the dome.
[07:44.510 --> 07:45.630]  So it's wet inside there.
[07:45.630 --> 07:47.150]  Then I put that dome right on top of it.
[07:47.150 --> 07:50.590]  At this point, all of the vents are covered up and then I put it under a light to get
[07:50.590 --> 07:52.030]  a lot of humidity happening in there.
[07:52.310 --> 07:55.190]  And I probably won't touch that for five to seven days.
[07:55.430 --> 07:59.190]  Uh, then I'll slowly start popping it open for a little bit of time, slowly
[07:59.190 --> 08:02.590]  open the vents and increase my open interval until I can get them into their
[08:02.590 --> 08:03.270]  forever homes.
[08:03.270 --> 08:05.590]  But, uh, that is a quickie on how to do clones.
[08:05.590 --> 08:06.750]  There are full episodes on that.
[08:06.750 --> 08:08.750]  However, YouTube keeps taking mine down.
[08:08.750 --> 08:10.070]  Shout out to YouTube for that part.
[08:10.510 --> 08:13.630]  Um, so get your plants, grow them till they're big enough to get a clone,
[08:13.630 --> 08:15.310]  get three clones from each plant.
[08:16.110 --> 08:18.150]  Uh, I like to wait since you're kind of new.
[08:18.150 --> 08:21.630]  I would wait until those clones begin to show roots.
[08:21.630 --> 08:23.030]  That way, you know, that you've got them.
[08:23.030 --> 08:24.110]  They're going to be successful.
[08:24.110 --> 08:25.990]  You've got three opportunities for each one.
[08:26.350 --> 08:29.350]  As soon as you see roots popping out of, however, you're doing the clones.
[08:29.350 --> 08:32.390]  If it's out of the bottom of the easy cloner or popping out of the rapid
[08:32.390 --> 08:35.950]  routers, then I would put the main big plants into flower.
[08:36.030 --> 08:37.790]  Now we can move the big plants into flower.
[08:37.790 --> 08:38.550]  We've got clones.
[08:38.550 --> 08:41.230]  We don't have to stress about having a preservation or a backup.
[08:41.390 --> 08:42.390]  They're already rooting.
[08:42.390 --> 08:43.310]  They should work out.
[08:43.510 --> 08:45.910]  And also if they don't, you've still got a few days to take clones.
[08:45.950 --> 08:48.590]  There's also the option for revenge, but I digress.
[08:48.590 --> 08:49.590]  Let's keep going here.
[08:49.990 --> 08:51.270]  Uh, we've got our clones.
[08:51.470 --> 08:53.510]  We're going to put the big plants under 12, 12.
[08:53.550 --> 08:57.830]  They're going to start flowering now in about 12 days, you should be able
[08:57.830 --> 08:59.910]  to identify the males and the females.
[08:59.910 --> 09:01.150]  It may take a little bit longer.
[09:01.150 --> 09:05.150]  It may be a little bit earlier, but generally 10 to 14 days is how long it
[09:05.150 --> 09:08.390]  takes for a cannabis plant to show you if it's a male or a female.
[09:08.390 --> 09:10.390]  This will depend on several things.
[09:10.390 --> 09:13.430]  This will depend on how far end of veg this plant has been going.
[09:13.430 --> 09:14.910]  How long has it been in that pot?
[09:15.150 --> 09:16.390]  Uh, how root bound is it?
[09:17.070 --> 09:18.190]  How tall is the plant?
[09:18.470 --> 09:21.870]  Also, some plants like to show you that they're male way earlier than some
[09:21.870 --> 09:23.190]  other plants like to show you male.
[09:23.190 --> 09:26.750]  So just maybe a real eager candidate to show you that's a male.
[09:26.990 --> 09:29.070]  Also, this will depend on your lighting.
[09:29.070 --> 09:30.910]  How much lighting have you been giving these plants?
[09:30.910 --> 09:34.510]  If they're getting a lot of light, it may show you a little bit more early.
[09:34.510 --> 09:37.350]  If they haven't been getting a lot of light, it may take a little bit longer.
[09:37.670 --> 09:40.670]  Also, one thing to keep in mind that I noticed those plants, they get real
[09:40.670 --> 09:43.150]  stretchy right away and grow right above everybody.
[09:43.470 --> 09:45.550]  A lot of the times those are male plants.
[09:45.550 --> 09:48.830]  So get, don't get too excited about the taller plants in the garden when you're
[09:48.830 --> 09:51.710]  in veg, because oftentimes those are the boys.
[09:51.710 --> 09:54.830]  They want to get above all the girls so that when they get taller, when it's
[09:54.830 --> 09:58.550]  time to flower, they can put pollen out and the pollen will fall down onto the girls.
[09:58.830 --> 10:01.430]  That's why the boys try to get taller, get above everybody.
[10:01.670 --> 10:02.990]  That's their whole intention of that.
[10:02.990 --> 10:04.950]  Let me get back to the notes, back to the question.
[10:05.270 --> 10:07.750]  That way we can help you out a little bit more accurately.
[10:07.750 --> 10:11.430]  My question is how would I control males from not throwing pollen?
[10:12.070 --> 10:17.310]  So they're probably not going to dump pollen somewhere until about day 14 to 21.
[10:17.310 --> 10:21.190]  Maybe right in that area about day 17 is probably when you're going to get pollen.
[10:21.430 --> 10:24.150]  They're going to show you that they're males about day 10.
[10:24.150 --> 10:27.830]  So you've got a four day, seven day period of when you're not going to have any
[10:27.830 --> 10:29.030]  problems, you can pull them out of there.
[10:29.030 --> 10:33.230]  They don't just the male plants don't just pop up and go poof, I'm ejecting pollen.
[10:33.350 --> 10:37.230]  They start building, you've got to look at books and establish, first of all, learn
[10:37.230 --> 10:38.670]  how to identify males and females.
[10:38.670 --> 10:42.030]  That should have been, I should have done that part should have guided you to do
[10:42.030 --> 10:43.830]  that part way earlier in this episode.
[10:44.110 --> 10:46.310]  Learn how to identify males and females.
[10:46.510 --> 10:48.110]  That should be in every cannabis book.
[10:48.110 --> 10:49.390]  That should be all over the internet.
[10:49.390 --> 10:50.630]  I've done an episode on it.
[10:50.950 --> 10:53.390]  Learn how to identify males and females.
[10:53.670 --> 10:54.630]  They will start popping up.
[10:54.630 --> 10:58.070]  The males will start popping up little nubs and that little nub will start to
[10:58.070 --> 10:59.830]  get a little, a little branch on it.
[10:59.830 --> 11:01.830]  And then on that branch will form a little ball.
[11:01.870 --> 11:04.150]  Then more balls will form and then more balls will form.
[11:04.150 --> 11:07.070]  And eventually those balls will start to open up and pollen will come out.
[11:07.390 --> 11:10.910]  You get plenty of warning that that is a male plant before the pollen form.
[11:10.910 --> 11:12.230]  So pay attention.
[11:12.230 --> 11:15.870]  That is the way to prevent the pollen from coming out.
[11:16.590 --> 11:17.590]  Identify the males.
[11:17.590 --> 11:18.270]  You can do that.
[11:18.430 --> 11:22.070]  Like I said, probably 10 to 14 days and you've still got, if you do it quickly
[11:22.070 --> 11:23.870]  enough, you will not get any pollen in the room.
[11:23.870 --> 11:27.430]  You got to go in there and do a visual inspection of every single plant.
[11:27.750 --> 11:31.110]  Push all the plants into a group on one side of the room and then move them back
[11:31.710 --> 11:33.790]  over into their spot to the left side of the room.
[11:33.950 --> 11:37.630]  As you look at them, not a, not a male, move it over, not a male, move it over,
[11:37.630 --> 11:38.950]  not a male, move it over.
[11:39.190 --> 11:41.590]  So put them into flower and pay attention to them.
[11:41.590 --> 11:42.630]  Your other option.
[11:42.870 --> 11:46.630]  Another option is you can get a lab sex test.
[11:46.630 --> 11:51.310]  You can order a lab sex testing kit from Farmer Freeman or other companies.
[11:51.310 --> 11:52.950]  Big shout out to our buddy Farmer Freeman.
[11:53.270 --> 11:56.230]  Uh, does not pay me to support him, but he's just a good, got a good product,
[11:56.230 --> 11:56.830]  does good work.
[11:56.830 --> 12:01.870]  So, uh, they will send you a, uh, sex testing sample kit.
[12:02.030 --> 12:04.710]  You'll take a little sample of your leaf and rub it on a little card.
[12:04.710 --> 12:07.870]  I'm not sure how Farmer Freeman does it, but you just take a leaf, rub it on a
[12:07.870 --> 12:09.350]  card, fold that up.
[12:09.470 --> 12:12.070]  You mark that plant number seven or whatever it says.
[12:12.070 --> 12:14.590]  And then you mark that card number seven or whatever it says.
[12:14.870 --> 12:17.350]  You send all your cards to the testing lab.
[12:17.350 --> 12:20.230]  They send you an email that says plant one is a boy plant.
[12:20.230 --> 12:21.230]  Two was a girl plant.
[12:21.230 --> 12:22.310]  Three is a boy plant.
[12:22.310 --> 12:23.150]  Four is a girl.
[12:23.270 --> 12:26.190]  They let you have a breakdown of every plant that is male and female.
[12:26.270 --> 12:30.550]  So then you can use that lab testing, or you can use your visual eyes to go ahead
[12:30.550 --> 12:31.950]  and identify male plants.
[12:31.950 --> 12:35.230]  And when you do identify the males, if it's through a lab report or if it's
[12:35.230 --> 12:39.230]  through your own visual identification, go ahead and cut down that male plant.
[12:39.230 --> 12:42.870]  But wait till you're sure, because a lot of people are new and they see some stuff
[12:42.870 --> 12:45.190]  happening and they think that the plant is a male and they cut it down a little
[12:45.190 --> 12:45.750]  bit early.
[12:46.030 --> 12:48.750]  Make sure you're certain that that plant is a male and then cut it down.
[12:48.750 --> 12:50.950]  As soon as you're positive, it is a male.
[12:50.950 --> 12:55.270]  Then the next step is to go in the clone room and remove all of the clones that
[12:55.270 --> 12:56.310]  came from that plant.
[12:56.310 --> 12:59.350]  So when you cut the clones, make sure they are clearly labeled.
[12:59.470 --> 13:01.670]  So go in the room, clearly label the clones.
[13:01.670 --> 13:04.870]  When you cut them, they came from plant a plant B plant C.
[13:04.870 --> 13:06.110]  You can name them if you want.
[13:06.110 --> 13:07.590]  You can give them letters, numbers.
[13:07.830 --> 13:10.390]  You could put colored stickers on them as long as it matches.
[13:10.590 --> 13:14.870]  Red plant, red clones, purple plant, purple clones, plant number 57, clone
[13:14.870 --> 13:15.750]  number 57.
[13:15.750 --> 13:19.350]  As long as that shit matches up in your code, you could draw hieroglyphics if you
[13:19.350 --> 13:20.790]  want, as long as it matches.
[13:20.790 --> 13:24.510]  And you know that I've got to get rid of the, uh, the hieroglyphic that looks like
[13:24.510 --> 13:28.230]  an antelope on the big plant and the hieroglyphic that looks like an antelope
[13:28.230 --> 13:29.670]  on the little plant.
[13:29.670 --> 13:30.870]  So, uh, go in there.
[13:31.150 --> 13:35.710]  Once you've identified the males and females remove both the big plant and the
[13:35.710 --> 13:36.350]  little plant.
[13:36.350 --> 13:39.510]  And then the other part of the question is, uh, how long would it take for a
[13:39.510 --> 13:41.390]  novice grower to realize the males?
[13:41.750 --> 13:45.070]  If you do a little bit of research on the internet and look at a couple of books
[13:45.070 --> 13:48.670]  and see what a male and a female plant looks like, it'll be very obvious in
[13:48.670 --> 13:50.350]  about 12 days from flower.
[13:50.510 --> 13:52.630]  I really think you'll be able to identify them.
[13:52.630 --> 13:57.350]  If you can't, uh, come to the discord, come to the iree army discord and go to
[13:57.350 --> 14:01.430]  the general help tab or anywhere in there and just post pictures and say, Hey, can
[14:01.430 --> 14:04.030]  somebody help me identify if these are males or females?
[14:04.750 --> 14:08.230]  A lot of people will go in there and they'll give you very useful advice.
[14:08.230 --> 14:09.950]  I trust the people in the iree army.
[14:10.190 --> 14:13.430]  And if you really, really need help tag me and I'll go look at it and I'll see if
[14:13.430 --> 14:16.630]  I can give you solid advice, but I do trust the whole crew in there.
[14:16.630 --> 14:17.990]  They will give you good advice.
[14:18.350 --> 14:19.470]  Um, how long would it take?
[14:19.470 --> 14:20.430]  Probably about 10 days.
[14:21.230 --> 14:22.670]  I will be going on vacation.
[14:22.710 --> 14:24.150]  Oh, this is going to be the fun part.
[14:24.150 --> 14:26.030]  Going on vacation, March 22nd.
[14:26.350 --> 14:29.550]  If I flip to flower, would I have enough time to see the males and
[14:29.550 --> 14:31.030]  remove them from the garden?
[14:31.350 --> 14:34.230]  Which should be about three weeks or so from me writing this.
[14:34.510 --> 14:38.510]  Uh, you're going to find out if you got males or females in about 14 days, I
[14:38.510 --> 14:41.870]  would flip now when this episode comes out, it's time to flip, do it that day.
[14:42.150 --> 14:45.510]  Uh, it's going to be the first week of March still, uh, when this comes out.
[14:45.510 --> 14:47.110]  So go ahead and flip now, do that.
[14:47.110 --> 14:48.950]  Now that's my advice to you.
[14:49.230 --> 14:49.470]  All right.
[14:49.470 --> 14:50.270]  There is more to this.
[14:50.270 --> 14:51.830]  He does talk about the setup.
[14:52.110 --> 14:53.830]  Uh, we don't need to know about the setup right now.
[14:53.830 --> 14:55.430]  We are still sexing the plants.
[14:55.670 --> 14:57.590]  So really quickly, I do have some notes here.
[14:57.710 --> 14:59.790]  It says, veg them, uh, clone them.
[14:59.790 --> 15:02.310]  Make sure you get good labels, flip the big plants.
[15:02.310 --> 15:04.150]  Also, you guys, you don't have to flip the big plants.
[15:04.150 --> 15:06.070]  A lot of people will flip the small plants.
[15:06.390 --> 15:09.230]  Uh, and then you can find out if those are males or females right away
[15:09.430 --> 15:10.350]  or another way to do it.
[15:10.350 --> 15:11.630]  I should have mentioned this also.
[15:11.790 --> 15:15.590]  Um, you can just veg them and then re are flip them into flower and re veg.
[15:15.590 --> 15:16.470]  I've talked about that.
[15:16.630 --> 15:18.750]  However, this listener does not have time for that because
[15:18.750 --> 15:20.250]  he's got to go on vacation.
[15:20.550 --> 15:24.990]  Um, keep the clones you need, keep the big plants you need, and then watch out
[15:24.990 --> 15:28.510]  for the males and Cole, the plants that you don't need, I think I covered it.
[15:28.550 --> 15:29.430]  I recapped.
[15:29.550 --> 15:31.270]  I think I answered your question pretty well.
[15:31.390 --> 15:32.550]  My friend, hi, off kebabs.
[15:32.550 --> 15:33.790]  Thank you for the great question.
[15:33.990 --> 15:37.070]  I hope we are able to identify your male and female plants
[15:37.070 --> 15:38.870]  before you do go on vacation.
[15:39.070 --> 15:43.230]  Like we said, if you need any help, do send pictures to the IRI army discord.
[15:43.430 --> 15:46.310]  We will do our best to help you out, but it should be quite obvious,
[15:46.310 --> 15:47.310]  which are boys and girls.
[15:47.310 --> 15:51.670]  And also don't forget, send me another email with your shipping address and a
[15:51.670 --> 15:56.830]  good name to put on the box because you, my friend did win a free pack of IRI.
[15:56.950 --> 15:58.470]  Genetics seeds.
[15:58.470 --> 15:58.670]  All right.
[15:58.670 --> 16:00.150]  I've got another message here in front of me.
[16:00.150 --> 16:01.470]  I don't want to waste too much time.
[16:01.750 --> 16:03.190]  I do get quite rambly.
[16:03.350 --> 16:07.510]  This one came from the IRI genetics help tab on IRI genetics.com.
[16:07.870 --> 16:10.750]  Uh, the listener wants to be called ripened bananas.
[16:10.950 --> 16:12.370]  They've got a problem in the garden.
[16:12.370 --> 16:16.110]  They're growing wedding cheesecake, auto cross to jawa pie.
[16:16.110 --> 16:17.070]  That sounds delicious.
[16:17.070 --> 16:19.030]  They're going indoors under LEDs.
[16:19.350 --> 16:21.110]  Let's get to the main part of the question here.
[16:21.110 --> 16:23.550]  I'm not sure some of this info pertains to the question.
[16:23.870 --> 16:28.830]  It says yo Rasta, Jeff, I'm wondering about keeping regular males and auto
[16:28.910 --> 16:34.010]  to regular F1 males and the veg light cycle to save on hold to eventually
[16:34.010 --> 16:35.710]  breed with, but not for a while.
[16:35.710 --> 16:35.990]  All right.
[16:36.190 --> 16:36.910]  So long sentence.
[16:36.910 --> 16:39.150]  I have another breeding project going first.
[16:39.510 --> 16:39.710]  All right.
[16:39.710 --> 16:41.190]  So there's a lot of stuff to unpack there.
[16:41.190 --> 16:45.350]  Regular males are going to be one set of answers in this question.
[16:45.750 --> 16:50.190]  Auto to regulars are going to be another answer and F1 males just count
[16:50.190 --> 16:53.070]  on the same batch as regular males.
[16:53.070 --> 16:58.110]  Also, I think autos could be F1s as well, but, um, just wanted to clear some of
[16:58.110 --> 16:59.830]  that up and then we're going to move forward.
[16:59.830 --> 17:02.750]  It says, um, I have another breeding project going.
[17:02.790 --> 17:07.510]  Will the male plants in veg typically not pollinate any females around, or
[17:07.510 --> 17:11.310]  will they sometimes pollinate female plants if they are held, held for a
[17:11.310 --> 17:13.630]  long time in a vegetative stage?
[17:13.910 --> 17:15.310]  I feel like stable genetics.
[17:15.470 --> 17:18.910]  Uh, that's not the correct term use of the word stable here.
[17:18.910 --> 17:23.550]  We've talked about that would mostly not pollinate unless in flower light cycle,
[17:23.550 --> 17:26.670]  but I also wouldn't be surprised if it happens sometime to trying to hone my
[17:26.670 --> 17:29.430]  skills with stability and best practices.
[17:29.430 --> 17:33.030]  Thank you so much for all of your awesome content and info for sharing your
[17:33.030 --> 17:35.190]  expressions and for your desire to help others.
[17:35.190 --> 17:36.310]  You're the man much love, bro.
[17:36.310 --> 17:37.590]  That is a great message.
[17:37.590 --> 17:39.070]  There's a lot to talk about here.
[17:39.430 --> 17:41.830]  Um, oh, by the way, also you did win a free pack of seeds.
[17:41.830 --> 17:45.310]  I'm reading your message here on the show, which means that you should send
[17:45.310 --> 17:50.270]  me your address as well so that I can send you a free pack of IRI genetic seeds.
[17:50.270 --> 17:53.270]  And that giveaway once again is sponsored by seeds here and now.com.
[17:53.510 --> 17:55.350]  Got to remember to mention our friends at seeds here.
[17:55.350 --> 17:57.030]  Now let's talk about a lot of this.
[17:57.750 --> 18:02.990]  Uh, will the male plants, uh, typically not pollinate, um, in a vegetative stage.
[18:02.990 --> 18:05.550]  If it's in a true vegetative stage, it will not pollinate.
[18:05.550 --> 18:06.750]  Those plants will not pollinate.
[18:06.750 --> 18:08.150]  Like I talked about previously.
[18:08.470 --> 18:11.590]  Uh, they'll need some time to shift into the flower stage.
[18:11.750 --> 18:14.070]  Then they'll need time to start developing pollen sacks.
[18:14.070 --> 18:16.110]  Then it'll take a little bit for those sacks to open.
[18:16.350 --> 18:18.030]  You should be paying attention to the plants.
[18:18.030 --> 18:20.910]  You should be able to identify that way before that happens.
[18:20.910 --> 18:25.710]  However, these are cannabis plants and shit does go haywire.
[18:25.710 --> 18:29.310]  Sometimes if you get a male plant that is not getting enough light, they get, it
[18:29.310 --> 18:32.470]  becomes root bound or is just not getting fed enough.
[18:32.710 --> 18:35.430]  Sometimes they'll go into panic mode and they will start to
[18:35.430 --> 18:37.030]  flower just like a female plant.
[18:37.430 --> 18:41.350]  Some of us have female plants that are of a more tropical variety,
[18:41.470 --> 18:43.230]  a longer flowering varietal.
[18:43.310 --> 18:46.310]  Sometimes if you don't give them enough light, if they get a little bit root
[18:46.310 --> 18:49.910]  bound, if they get shaded a little bit, or if you just over or under feed it,
[18:49.910 --> 18:53.310]  or if it gets bugs, it may just go into flower because it's in fucking panic
[18:53.310 --> 18:55.910]  mode and that's just what some plants do.
[18:56.110 --> 18:59.990]  So if your male plant does experience any stress, any drought, overfeeding,
[18:59.990 --> 19:04.030]  underfeeding, uh, if it's too crowded in, it may start to stretch up and
[19:04.030 --> 19:05.110]  then it'll go, Hey, guess what?
[19:05.110 --> 19:06.150]  You're not treating me right.
[19:06.430 --> 19:09.230]  I'm going into flower and then it'll just flower at that point.
[19:09.230 --> 19:10.910]  Yes, it can pollinate plants.
[19:11.230 --> 19:14.430]  Uh, but keep in mind also the female plants can only receive pollen once
[19:14.430 --> 19:18.950]  they've developed pistols and the male plants, uh, will only pollinate once
[19:18.950 --> 19:22.510]  they've developed these stamens and those have grown out and then exploded a little
[19:22.510 --> 19:22.790]  bit.
[19:23.030 --> 19:25.750]  So let me catch up, read the notes here, make sure I'm on the right track
[19:25.750 --> 19:26.990]  to answer you a little bit.
[19:27.350 --> 19:30.430]  Um, they won't pollinate, uh, unless they make some pollen.
[19:30.430 --> 19:33.950]  You gotta put them into flower or they've got to, uh, flower because you've
[19:33.950 --> 19:36.030]  stress induced that flowering stage.
[19:36.430 --> 19:37.870]  Uh, then stability.
[19:38.030 --> 19:39.190]  We've talked about stability.
[19:39.190 --> 19:43.670]  That is more, uh, stability means uniformity amongst population more than
[19:43.670 --> 19:44.190]  anything.
[19:44.190 --> 19:50.630]  So, um, any plants could, uh, express a phenotype that will make pollen under,
[19:50.710 --> 19:52.310]  uh, not perfect conditions.
[19:52.310 --> 19:54.710]  If you're stressing the plant that could happen with any plant.
[19:54.710 --> 19:56.310]  So, uh, keep the room, right?
[19:56.310 --> 19:57.630]  Keep the male plant happy.
[19:57.870 --> 20:00.670]  Uh, don't a lot of people just shove the male off into the corner and they're
[20:00.670 --> 20:02.030]  like, I'll use him when I need him.
[20:02.230 --> 20:04.270]  Uh, treat him like he's the star of the show.
[20:04.310 --> 20:05.710]  The male plant is the fucking King.
[20:05.710 --> 20:07.190]  My plant is called King Solomon.
[20:07.590 --> 20:11.030]  Uh, without the, without that male, the other girls aren't going to make seeds.
[20:11.190 --> 20:13.030]  So he stays right in the middle under the light.
[20:13.030 --> 20:14.350]  I've got a Jack the Ripper male.
[20:14.550 --> 20:15.670]  We've got a King Solomon male.
[20:15.670 --> 20:17.310]  I got the BC lemon skunk male.
[20:17.550 --> 20:20.550]  Uh, there's a chocolate male all just right under their own light.
[20:20.550 --> 20:24.070]  The boys get their own little section because they're just as important to me.
[20:24.070 --> 20:28.030]  So don't overlook the importance of taking care of your male plant, of, uh,
[20:28.070 --> 20:31.990]  pruning it, lollipopping it, topping it, taking a couple of backup clones every
[20:31.990 --> 20:35.190]  now and then, just in case when I'm in the room cutting clones, even if I don't
[20:35.190 --> 20:38.230]  need a clone of the boys, I'm going to take a clone off the bottom branches.
[20:38.230 --> 20:42.030]  They clean up just because if some shit goes wrong, I want to have one in the
[20:42.030 --> 20:45.670]  cloner, one in a small pot, and then one under the lights, because those
[20:45.670 --> 20:47.190]  are the, those are the pollinators, bro.
[20:47.190 --> 20:48.430]  I've, it took longer.
[20:48.670 --> 20:52.070]  I spent more time selecting the male plants than I did any of the female
[20:52.070 --> 20:54.710]  plants, because I need solid male plants in my lineup.
[20:54.710 --> 20:56.190]  I've talked a lot about that, but.
[20:56.830 --> 21:00.270]  Um, give them their space, give them the room, the area, the care that the
[21:00.270 --> 21:04.430]  male plants that they deserve, just like the females, they are all equal in that
[21:04.430 --> 21:09.950]  room, um, trying to hone my skills and with, uh, stability and best practices.
[21:10.110 --> 21:11.710]  Thank you so much for your awesome content, bro.
[21:11.710 --> 21:12.710]  Thank you for the great question.
[21:12.710 --> 21:14.430]  I hope I answered your, your question.
[21:14.430 --> 21:18.150]  If you give them proper care, proper light, they will not throw any pollen
[21:18.310 --> 21:22.790]  until they go into pollen or there of course is the option to stress induce
[21:22.830 --> 21:24.870]  some pollen from those male plants.
[21:25.110 --> 21:26.470]  All right, dude, thank you for the great question.
