[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Welcome to the show everybody. It's time for episode 360 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.000]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.000 --> 00:17.000]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  Today I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack FSE from Fuego Extracts.
[00:25.000 --> 00:32.000]  I really love the flavor of this stuff. It tastes like bubble gum. The flavor just lingers on my tongue. I really like it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:47.000]  There's a little information printed on the side of the package here. It's got a lab test that says 71.83% Max THC, 2.85% CBGA, and it's got 9.98% terpenes.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  I really enjoy this concentrate. That bubble gum, cotton candy flavor that just lingers on the tongue is perfect.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  And then that head high that goes straight to the brain and keeps you rambling, keeps you motivated is perfect.
[00:58.000 --> 01:06.000]  So a big two thumbs up to the Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts. I really do enjoy smoking this.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  All right, you guys, let's keep moving this show forward because I have got a lot to talk about.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  We're going to get back into the grow lessons on this episode.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  This is going to be the eighth lesson in a long series of grow lessons.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  So far, we've talked about our goals and ideas and where to set up our grow.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  We've gone over the equipment. We've talked about the lights. We've talked about our containers.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  We've talked about soil and medium. We've talked about pest control.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  And if you're not caught up, I recommend you go back to episode 351 and start there.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  There are a couple of interruptions in the lessons.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  I will sneak in a few episodes that are not grow lessons while I'm doing this series.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  Sometimes I'll need to read emails. Sometimes I'll need to answer questions.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  Coming up, we're going to have some iTunes customer reviews.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Things like that will disrupt the lessons, but I think it keeps the shows fresh.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  It keeps me motivated and it keeps it fun.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  But in this episode, we will continue the grow lessons.
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  But before we get there, let's talk about a couple of things I kind of overlooked while we were talking about building our grow.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  It might be a good idea to add a smoke detector to each grow room.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  Wherever you've got a grow light hanging, have a smoke detector in that room.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  Also, I would recommend a fire extinguisher outside of each grow room.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  Now, I hope you don't have to use it, but if that smoke alarm goes off, you would rather have that fire extinguisher outside of the grow room.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  So you don't have to open the door, run in there, get the fire extinguisher, then start working on the fire.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  If it's outside of the grow room, you can just grab it. You can be a little more prepared.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  You can get in there. You can start putting out the fire.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  Also, if you've never used a fire extinguisher, maybe read the instructions.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  Maybe understand what to do in case of a fire.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Maybe just read that little book that comes with it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  And also, make sure it stays charged. It's got a gauge on it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's got a red, a yellow, and a green.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Make sure your little arrow is in the green at all times.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  You might want to think about some sort of automated fire suppression system.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  They make things that hang in the middle of the grow room.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  It's got a little heat sensor in it. If it gets too hot, it basically explodes.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  It releases a powder that rains down into the grow room.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  That will put out any fire that's in the room.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  Think about some sort of way to detect and suppress a fire in your grow room should that situation occur.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  Another thing I overlooked when we were designing and building our room was an automated watering or an assisted watering system.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  An automated watering system can really speed things up once you get into a larger grow.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  It also makes the plants really happy because the plants love consistency.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  If you're interested in designing an auto watering system, I did a full episode about auto watering on episode 335.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Unfortunately, there were some audio technical difficulties and parts of the episode chop out.
[03:42.000 --> 03:52.000]  If you listened to that episode and you still have specific questions, send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com and we will get your auto water system dialed in.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  All right, so at this point, we should have goals and reasonable expectations for our grow.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  We should have a good idea of where we want to put the grow.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  We should have a good idea of the gear we want to buy, the lights, the pots, the medium.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  We should also have a good idea of pest control.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  Now we've talked a little bit about fire suppression.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  I've also done an in-depth episode on fire suppression.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  That is episode 260.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  If you want to learn a lot about fire safety in your grow, episode number 260 will teach you a lot there.
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.000]  If you decide you want to add an auto watering system to your grow, episode 335 is the episode all about auto watering.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  So that should get us all caught up.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  The room is ready.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  We've got the gear planned out.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  We've got a good idea of pest management.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  We know what we're going to feed the plants.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  We know how to take care of a fire.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  We know how to set up an auto watering system if we need one.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Now we're getting to the fun part of this journey.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Let's start thinking about plants.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  What do you want to grow?
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.000]  What do you want to dedicate your time, your energy, your space, and a bunch of money to over the next 90 to 120 days?
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  What strains have gotten your attention?
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  What strains do you really enjoy smoking?
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  Does something work for you medically?
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Does something work for you recreationally?
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  Is there something that is reliable that every time you smoke it, you get the desired effect?
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  This is going to fall back to the very first episode of this Grow Lesson series.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.000]  Are you growing this for yourself?
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Are you growing it for a medical patient?
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  You have a lot of things to think about when it comes to deciding what strains to grow in your new garden.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  In legal, medical, and recreational states, we have a lot more options for acquiring genetic material.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  We can go to a dispensary and buy a clone off of the shelf.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  We can go to our friend's garden and ask them for clones, and they can give, sell, or trade those clones to us.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  We can acquire clones here very easily in Colorado.
[05:40.000 --> 05:48.000]  In fact, I went to a dispensary just a few days ago to pick up these Fuego extracts, and they had two different variety of clones on the shelf that looked very healthy.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  They had Purple Punch and Dosey Dose on the shelf ready to go at a very reasonable price.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  So clones are readily available in Colorado.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  Seeds are also available in some Colorado dispensaries.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  You can walk right into the store, you can grab a pack of seeds, and you can start your new garden from seeds you picked up at your local dispensary.
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  Clones and seeds are both viable options for starting a garden.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  This episode is going to focus on the great debate on seeds versus clones.
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.000]  Before we get into that, let's talk a little bit about how you can decide what strain you want to grow.
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  The best way to do that is to smoke a bunch of different strains.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  Now, if you're in a medical or recreational state, that is a lot easier than if you are in Prohibition land.
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.000]  If you're in Prohibition land, who knows if the strain you are buying is even really what whoever is selling it to you is called.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  They're probably growing something and they're calling everything cookies because cookies sells.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  Anything with the letters OG at the end of it sell.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  So you've probably got something cookies OG.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Anything with the word fire in there works well.
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  So you guys are probably buying fire cookies OG in Prohibition land everywhere, and it's probably whatever that person got a clone of,
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  or whatever that person is buying bulk of, and they're just renaming it because they know that names are hot.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  So in a Prohibition state, it's going to be a little bit harder.
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  Maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe you'll get a seed in your bag of weed one day.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  You can always grow out those bag seeds.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  Sometimes you find phenotypes very close to what you started with.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  Also, sometimes you find hermaphrodites and problematic plants, so be prepared for that as well.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  But sometimes it is your only option.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  It's always an awkward situation asking a grower for clones.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  If you're a new grower and you're buying herb from somebody, and you're like,
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  bro, I really love this strain. Do you think I could get a clone?
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  That always presents an awkward situation.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  First of all, now you both know you're growing.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  If you're in a Prohibition state, that makes things really weird for both of you.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  Also, that guy doesn't want to release his genetics to you because now he's going to lose a customer.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  So unless you're on a really friendly basis with your weed guy, I would avoid that conversation.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  Now in a legal state, in a recreational or a medical state,
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  it's really easy to go find out what strains work best for you.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  You go to the dispensary and you buy as many grams as you can afford of different varieties,
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  and you go home and you smoke them.
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  You start fresh every day and you try this strain.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  I haven't smoked this one yet. Let's smoke strain A.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  And you take a few notes and you see how it works for you first thing in the morning.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  If you've got a target, if you're trying to make your leg pain go away,
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  if you're trying to make your headache go away, if you're trying to make your back pain go away,
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  if you're trying to make your anxiety go away, document the level of which that ailment starts.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  Is it a five? Is that at a 10?
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  Okay, I started off with a level five leg pain.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  I smoked a bowl of this strain A. I know my leg pain is at a two.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  Document that. The next day I woke up, leg pain's at a five.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  I smoked strain B. Now my leg pain is still at a five.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  I obviously don't want to buy any more of this shit.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  Then you want to go the next day, day number three.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  I woke up, my leg pain's at a six. I smoked some of this.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  Now I'm at a two. This one might work well for me.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Let's put a little star by that and remember what this is.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  And then just keep doing little tests like that on yourself and with the flowers
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  and find out what strain works for you.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  If you find a strain at one dispensary that works very well for you,
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  try to find it at another dispensary and smoke that product
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  because they have different growers. They may have different clones.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  Their product is going to come out very different in the end.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  Even if we start with the same clone,
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  two commercial grows will produce two very different products.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  So try them both and see if it's the strain.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  It might have just been that one batch. It might have just been that one grow.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  But try different batches if possible.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I know it sounds like I'm completely spoiled, but this is a real thing.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  I can drive to 10 dispensaries in my area and probably five of them have wedding cake.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And that wedding cake was probably grown by three different grows.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  And I bet you if I try all three of them,
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  they're all going to have very subtle nuances.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  One will taste a little different. One's going to burn a little different.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  And one's going to have a better high.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  But they're all going to have that wedding cake, droopy eye, giggly kind of thing going on.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  So try to check them out from different grows if you can.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  Make sure that it's the strain and not just that one grower that did it for you.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  Now, one thing I want to loop back on,
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  we talked about trying to get a clone from your grower.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  If you do try to buy a clone from your grower friend,
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  don't be offended when he hits you with a really steep price.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Think about this. He's been selling you herb for how long?
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  And now you're going to grow your own?
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  How much money are you taking out of his pocket?
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  I know you're going to save that much money,
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  but that guy has been relying on you as a customer.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  And now you're going to try to grow your own.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  He's going to go, dude, this guy's gone.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  You've got to put a fat chunk in his pocket as a parting gift when he gives you that clone.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  That's why he needs so much for it.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  Also, he's the only one growing that in town.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  That's how he's living. That's how he's making his income.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  You're going to buy it into that. That genetic is going to be out there.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  How does he know you're not going to run a bunch of it and flood the town with it?
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  So when they hit you with a really high price for a clone in a prohibition state, that's why.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  It's because that's how that person is living.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  That is his income. That's his artwork.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  He's probably phenohunted that, or he paid a whole lot of money for that clone himself.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  So he's sharing his revenue stream with you
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  and kind of opening up the floodgates to put himself out of business.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  Once you guys do a phenohunt and you've found your own keeper,
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  you'll kind of understand a little bit more, especially in a prohibition state.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  All right, you guys, we've talked a little bit about deciding what you want to grow.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  What you want to grow is up to you.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Once you decide what you want to grow,
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  if you pick something that takes 10 or 12 weeks and it grows tall and skinny,
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  if that's really what you think you want to grow, you're going to have to adapt to that plant.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  Don't try to make that plant adapt to you.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  That is not how it works.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  All right, I've got a bunch of notes, but I don't have a good segue.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  So let's just jump right into this.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  Let's talk about the debate on seeds versus clones.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  You've decided what you want to grow.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Now, do you want to grow it from seed or from clone?
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  Growing from either seed or clone both have their advantages and disadvantages.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  Something you'll have to think about with both of them is availability.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Are clones available where you are?
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  Does somebody in your area grow that is willing to release clones to you
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  for your personal production?
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  Is there a dispensary in your area that sells clones?
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  If I read correctly, in Canada, you can ship clones to each other through the mail.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  So that's an option.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  But if nobody has clones near you, they are not available.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  Now, if somebody does have clones, are they accurately labeled?
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  Do they have the variety you're looking for?
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  And are they clean?
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  It's kind of the same story with seeds.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  Do you know somebody that's got seeds that is willing to share some with you?
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  And if you get them from somebody, are they accurately labeled?
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  And do they have the variety that you're looking for?
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  One of the advantages of seeds is that there are shops on the Internet
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  that will send seeds directly to your mailbox.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  If you are in a prohibition state and you order seeds from an online vendor,
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  it is your responsibility to keep those seeds in the packaging
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  and do not allow them to grow if it is illegal to grow them in your area.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  You can save them as souvenirs and collectibles until legalization happens in your area
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  or until you move to a legalized state.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  But there are several online vendors who will send you seeds to keep as collectibles.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  If you do choose to germinate those and grow those yourself, that is your responsibility.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Anything that happens from that is up to you.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  But seeds are available online, and seeds don't die in the mail.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  Now, I want to do a friendly debate on clone versus seed.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  But to keep it fair, we need to act like there is a place where we can go
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  that has clones and seeds available in just about any variety we could imagine.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  Think about the strain that you chose you want to grow for your first time.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  Let's imagine there's a dispensary where we can go,
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  and they've got flowers of that strain grown by three different growers,
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  so we can smoke it from three different people and make sure it's what we like.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  They've also got extracts there, so if you're into smoking concentrates,
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  they've got full-spectrum extract, they've got shatter, they've got wax.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  They've got whatever you're into that way, so you can make sure
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  that's the strain you desire for your concentrates.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  Then also, they have got seeds and clones of your favorite strain ready for you there.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Now, you've got the option. Do you want to buy seeds or clones for your grow?
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Let's start a friendly debate right here.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  Now, before I get too far into this, let me give a quick explanation on what a clone is.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  I'm pretty sure most people know what a seed is.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  That's a little bean that grows into a big plant. It came out of another plant.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  Now, let's talk about a clone. A clone is basically a photocopy of a plant.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  We take a cutting off of a plant, and it roots, and now we have a photocopy of the plant we started with.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  Cannabis plants are annuals, which means they only live for one year or one cycle.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  So we grow it from seed, it produces bud, we harvest it, it is over.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  By taking a clone, we can have that plant again and again.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  Then we can have repeatable, reliable outcomes and a reliable product from each harvest.
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  So a clone is basically a genetic photocopy of a reliable plant in the form of just a tiny little plant.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  We'll talk about clones, and we'll talk about phenohunting a lot more as these grow lessons go on.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  Now, let's talk about some of the pros and cons of seeds and clones.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  The pros of growing from seed.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  One of the best parts about growing from seed is there are no bugs and no pathogens.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  You don't get free powdery mildew with your new clone.
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  All too often, people give out clones that are infested with spider mites, with russet mites, with aphids, with thrips, or with powdery mildew.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  That is not an option with a seed.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  So let's also put that in the cons category when it comes to growing from clone.
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  One of the disadvantages of starting from clones is that they may come with bugs or pathogens.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  Now, let's talk about one of my favorite parts about growing from seed.
[15:45.000 --> 15:56.000]  Growing from seed allows me to find custom-tailored phenotypes that work perfectly for what I'm looking for medically and perfectly for what I'm looking for in my grow.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  It grows the height I want it to grow.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  It grows for as long as I want it to grow.
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  And it gives me medicine.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  It gives me the effect that I need.
[16:05.000 --> 16:13.000]  So growing from seed allows me to find something completely unique for myself that works perfectly for my garden and my medical needs.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  The con to that is it does take time for selection.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  I have to run the batch of seeds.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  I have to find the plant that works for me.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  Hopefully, there was one in that batch that was exactly what I wanted.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  If not, I keep searching.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  So that is the downside to that.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  And we will do an episode on phenohunting in the future that is lined up in this series.
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.000]  So one of the advantages is that I can find perfectly custom-tailored phenotypes that work for myself and my grow.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  The con to that is that it does take time for selection.
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  I have to run the seeds.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  I have to grow them up.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  I have to cut clones.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  I have to flower them out.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  I have to dry them, cure them, smoke them, and see which ones I enjoyed, see which ones I didn't enjoy.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  Usually, when I run a 10-pack, I find two or three that I want to run again.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  So I'll repeat the process and eliminate it to one.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  But that does take time, money, and energy to get to that point.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  Also, there may be males.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  There may be hermaphrodites.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  And there may be undesirable phenotypes in that test run.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  So depending on the quality of the seeds and the experience of the breeder and the stability of the work,
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  I may not find the phenotype I'm looking for in a 10-pack.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  It may take more than 10 seeds to find the desirable phenotype.
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  But if I've got reliable seeds and the breeder did his work and I've done my job properly,
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  I may find something in there that is amazing.
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  And I may find something in there that nobody else has, which will set me apart from the market.
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  If I'm growing for production to put on the street, having a very unique strain would set me apart from the market.
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.000]  If I've got the frostiest, dankest strain on the market, people are going to want to buy that first,
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  which means I'm going to make more sales, which means maybe I can charge a little more.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  So having that perfectly selected phenotype that grows exactly the way I want it to,
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  it grows perfectly for my grow, and it works perfect for my area, for my market,
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  that is a great advantage of growing from seed.
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  Another advantage of growing from seed is that there is a huge variety available.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  I know we talked about this imaginary store where everything is available, but it's not like that in all places.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  There are seed banks online that make many varieties of seeds from very many reputable breeders available to people all over the world.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  So seed availability is a huge advantage.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  Not everybody can get their hands on clean, reliable, accurately labeled clones.
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  So being able to order seeds from a seed bank is definitely advantageous.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Now the downside to that is seeds can be kind of expensive.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  Depending on the vendor and the breeder, seeds can have a huge markup.
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  And if you're working with regular seeds, you may lose 60% of your crop right when you switch to flower
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  because you're going to have male plants to deal with.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  So buying seeds can get expensive.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  And you also need to have a reliable breeder and a reputable vendor so that you know you are getting what you pay for.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  Now let's focus more on growing from clone.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  What are some of the advantages or pros of growing from a clone?
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  If properly selected, that clone is a female.
[19:12.000 --> 19:19.000]  If properly selected, that clone is known to put out high potency and to grow without any issues.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  Now that being said, we have to rely on a grower.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  So that is one of the cons of growing from clones.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  Somebody has to grow the seeds and find the keeper plants out of those seed packages.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  Hopefully, they chose the stellar keeper to pass on as clones to the consumers.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  In a dispensary, what usually happens is I'll cut 120 clones for my next run.
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.000]  I only need 100 of them, so I actually send those 20 to the store so that I don't have to throw them away.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  We put them on a manifest, we send them to the store, and those are made available for shoppers in the retail store.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  So if you're buying a clone from a dispensary and it's accurately labeled,
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000]  you're probably getting the same exact cut as they're growing and putting on the shelf.
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  So you know that those clones have been properly phenohunted.
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  You know that those clones are proven females with proven potency
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  and have proven themselves to be resistant to bugs and pathogens.
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  So that's the advantage to growing from a clone.
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  The disadvantage to that is who knows who selected that.
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  If you're just getting it from some dude on Craigslist, who knows how discerning his eye was.
[20:22.000 --> 20:28.000]  Maybe his idea of Amazing Bud and your idea of Amazing Bud are two completely different things.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  So keep that in mind when working with a clone.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  Another advantage of working with a clone is we have an idea of what to expect.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  Like we said before, somebody phenohunted this clone.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  They've grown it out a couple of times.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  They know that it's a female.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  They know that it's going to have high potency, either high CBD, high THC, or a beautiful ratio of both.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  We know what to expect.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  We also have an idea of what type of growth patterns to expect.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  Is it going to get real tall? Is it going to get real bushy?
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  Is it going to stretch out real bad? Is it going to need a lot of water?
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  We also have a good idea of how long it will take to finish
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  because our friends and partners have probably grown this cut several times before they gave it to us.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  So the main advantage to growing from clone is that you've got a proven female.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  You don't have to worry about calling males.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Every plant you put in there is a female.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  They've been tested for potency.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  They've been tested for vigor.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  They've been tested for resistance.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  We know what to expect.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  We know if we need sticks.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  We know if we need trellis.
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.000]  We know how often to water it.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  We know if we can overfeed it.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  We know if it likes a high or a low pH.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  And we already know how many days to let it flower.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  So that is a huge advantage from working with a clone.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Also, you can always call the guy and say,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  Hey bro, this plant's doing something weird.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Have you ever seen this strain do this?
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  And he'll say, Oh yeah, man, I grew that like 10 times before I gave it to you.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  You probably just need more CalMag.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  So he's got some sort of history, some sort of experience with it,
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  and he can help you diagnose a problem if one does arise.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  So that's a huge advantage of working with a clone.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  Let's talk about some of the disadvantages.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  The number one disadvantage, the number one con to bringing clones into your garden
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  is most of the time they are infested with bugs and pathogens.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Every grower likes to say, My grow is immaculate.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  There is not a single bug in my garden.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  Nine times out of 10, those guys are wrong.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  The guys that boast most about having the pest-free garden
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  are the ones that don't know the pests are there.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  The guys that say, No, I've got a little bit of spider mites.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  They're the guys that are paying attention, that are actually checking,
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  and they know that those bugs are there.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  They are there.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  So getting a clone, you're probably going to get some sort of a problem.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  Everybody also likes to say, My buddy wouldn't give me clones with pests on them.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Yeah, he doesn't even know they're there.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  He didn't check.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  He's not paying enough attention.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  He's just trying to make $5 a clone by selling them to you.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  He didn't care if you get spider mites or not
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  because you're going to need more clones in the future either way.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  So the downside to clones is they come with free bugs quite often.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  You get spider mites, you get free root aphids, you get free whiteflies,
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  you get free fungus gnats, and if you're really lucky,
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  sometimes you even get free powdery mildew with your new clones.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  Another disadvantage to growing from clone is everybody already has it.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  If you're just growing this strain for yourself, for your medical needs,
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  or for a loved one's medical needs, and that strain works perfectly for you,
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  that is great.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  But if you are growing for a market reason and everybody has that strain,
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  you're going to have to be a better grower than everybody else growing it
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  to make your product stand out.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  Otherwise, you're just another guy selling weed on the black market.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  If you don't have a standout strain, you will blend in just like everybody else.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  So if you're growing the same clone that all of your competition is growing,
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  you've really got to be the best grower.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  So that's one of the downsides to growing from clone is everybody's got it.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  And you guys, that's why some growers are tight with their genetics.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  That's why some guys won't let clones out
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  because they're the only one growing that specific strain in that area.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  If you want that, you've got to go to them.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  They've always got some income because their product stands out.
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  Now, another downside to working with clones is they can get expensive.
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  And something in me says that you get what you pay for when it comes to clones.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  If you're going to Craigslist and paying $3 to $5 for a clone,
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  you're going to get a $3 to $5 clone.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  It may be quality genetics.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  It may be what you're looking for, but how healthy is it?
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  How good of a start did it get?
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  How many bugs does it have?
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Clones can get expensive.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  The clones that I saw at the dispensary recently were in 4x4 cubes of cocoa.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  The clones were about 6 or 8 inches tall.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  They looked super healthy.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  They were $40.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  If you're trying to buy six of those, that's going to add up really quickly.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  Can you throw down $240 every time you want to start a fresh grow?
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  A package of seeds is way cheaper than that, but you have to do the work.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  You have to grow them.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  You have to find the males, and you have to find the keeper.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  The advantage with clone is somebody has already done all of that work for you,
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  so they can charge you $40.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  One of the disadvantages to growing from clone is that they are expensive.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  Unless you're getting them from a friend, they can add up in cost quite quickly.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  You guys, I've seen clones go from anywhere from $5 or $10.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  I saw those clones at the dispensary the other day.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  They had a purple punch and a dosy-dos.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  They were $40 each.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  It is not uncommon for me to see a clone sell for the $500 to $1,000 range.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  There are stories of certain cuts being sold for $10,000 to $25,000,
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  depending on what strain we're talking about.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  There are rumors of astronomical numbers, but I don't know how much of that is true.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  Some of the people in the Bay have paid ridiculous prices for some of the OG Kushes
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  and some of the more well-known strains that the rappers rap about.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Some of the OG Kush and Cookie Crosses went for big money when they first hit the market.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  People have built entire empires and businesses off of those cuts.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Clones can get quite expensive quite quickly.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  Another disadvantage to clones is, are they available?
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  Does anybody in your area have clones?
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Does anybody you trust have clones available?
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  If you do get clones, are they accurately labeled?
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  Ask your friends what clones they have.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  Don't ask for a specific strain.
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  If you ask for wedding cake, now your friend suddenly has wedding cake and he needs big money for it.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  If you ask what strains he's got available, he'll give you a list.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  Select from there.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  Don't give them the option to invent a name or slap a label on something
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  just because you're willing to throw some money their direction for that cut.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  So that is my quick debate on seed versus clone.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  We'll go over it really quickly again and recap.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  The pros of growing from seed, no bugs, no pests, no problems.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  You don't start off with somebody else's problems in your grow.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  Another advantage is that you can select perfectly selected phenotypes that work for you and your grow.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  Also, nobody else is going to have your phenotype, which will give you better market value.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  Some of the cons of growing from seed is that it takes time for selection.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  You have to grow them and find out what you've got, select a keeper, and then grow from there.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  You will also need to cull males and undesirable phenotypes.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  They're also a little bit expensive.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  Also, is the strain you want available in seed form?
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  Some of the older stuff may not be available anymore because breeders are always evolving and creating new stock.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  Another thing you have to think about is, are the seeds accurately labeled?
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Are you being sold what you're paying for?
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  Now let's talk about clones really quickly again.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  The pros, you have got proven, potent females.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  You know what you've got, you know what you're working with, you know what to expect, you know what to plan for.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  Some of the downsides to working with clones are, you get those bugs, you get those pathogens, you get free problems.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Also, everybody else in the area has it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  Everybody else is already growing it.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  There's nothing different.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  There's nothing exciting about it unless it's custom for you.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Also, are clones available?
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Can you even get clones?
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Do you trust the people you have to deal with to get them?
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  And are they accurately labeled when you do get them?
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  That is my quick, friendly, unbiased debate on seeds versus clones.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  Of course, being a breeder, I want you to buy seeds and I want you to buy them at dankseed.store.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  Then I want you to do a pheno hunt and find the one that works best for you.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  We will talk about pheno hunting in the future.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  We will also talk about cutting our own clones in the future.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  That way, once you've acquired clones or seeds, you can do a pheno hunt.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  You can select the keeper.
[28:23.000 --> 28:33.000]  Then we can cut clones off of that keeper and we can be self-sustainable and not have to acquire genetic material from other sources unless we decide to add something new to the grow.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  We'll talk about pheno hunting.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  We'll talk about cloning.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  We'll talk about mother plants.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  I have done a long episode about what to expect from a seed pack.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  I think that would make great supplemental listening to this episode.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  If you are interested in hearing my episode about seed pack expectations, it is episode 245.
