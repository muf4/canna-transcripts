[00:01.530 --> 00:22.030]  It's time for episode number 169 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:22.030 --> 00:28.470]  news, education, and conversation. That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a
[00:28.470 --> 00:32.410]  professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.410 --> 00:36.630]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,
[00:36.630 --> 00:41.430]  my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want
[00:41.430 --> 00:45.030]  to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout
[00:45.030 --> 00:49.230]  out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.230 --> 00:55.070]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, it
[00:55.070 --> 01:01.310]  is a frosty cold Thursday evening here in Colorado. It is 20 degrees outside, but that's
[01:01.310 --> 01:04.590]  okay. I'm going to stay nice and warm because the only reason I know it's so cold is because
[01:04.590 --> 01:08.630]  I had to answer the door for the FedEx guy and he just brought me a box of hoodies. I
[01:08.630 --> 01:13.070]  have got some sweet new custom Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies, you guys. On the
[01:13.070 --> 01:17.950]  front left breast, there's the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo without my face. It's got
[01:17.950 --> 01:22.110]  the, it says Grow From Your Heart podcast. It's got the red, yellow, and green EQ bar,
[01:22.110 --> 01:24.910]  like on your recording equipment or on your old school stereo to let you know you're not
[01:24.910 --> 01:29.310]  blowing up your levels. Then on the back, it's got the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:29.310 --> 01:34.170]  logo with the EQ bars. Then it's got my big old face right on there, just like the logo
[01:34.170 --> 01:38.290]  you see on iTunes, just like that logo you see on Stitcher, just like the logo on the
[01:38.290 --> 01:42.610]  website. It is the Grow From Your Heart podcast official logo, and it is now available on
[01:42.610 --> 01:46.290]  the back of a hoodie, you guys. If you are interested in one of those hoodies, send me
[01:46.290 --> 01:49.810]  an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I'll teach you how you can get one. I'd love
[01:49.810 --> 01:55.370]  to get one to you. These hoodies, of course, were made by our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:55.370 --> 01:59.410]  Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel. If you need some custom printed t-shirts,
[01:59.410 --> 02:04.050]  if you need custom printed hoodies, if you need some hat pins made, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:04.090 --> 02:08.690]  I fully endorse and highly recommend Handmade Apparel. These guys are members of the cannabis
[02:08.690 --> 02:13.370]  community, and I love supporting community members. You can find Handmade Apparel at
[02:13.370 --> 02:18.410]  handmadeapparel.biz. Send them an email. It will get you all of the information that you
[02:18.410 --> 02:23.290]  need to get your stuff printed. Get started with them. Let them know that you heard about
[02:23.290 --> 02:26.210]  them through the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Let them know you're listening. Let them know
[02:26.210 --> 02:29.630]  that I sent them your direction. We would both appreciate that. I want to tell a quick
[02:29.630 --> 02:36.470]  story about why I really respect and enjoy the company of Mr. Adam Hand, the founder,
[02:36.470 --> 02:41.710]  the proprietor, the main dude there of Handmade Apparel. Just a quick little rant on why I
[02:41.710 --> 02:47.590]  respect this dude so much. I was at the Denver Cannabis Cup one time in Denver, of course,
[02:47.590 --> 02:52.090]  right? It was at a place called the Exdo Event Center. The place was too tiny for how many
[02:52.090 --> 02:56.990]  people were in the facility. I was frustrated. It took me too long to park. It took me way
[02:56.990 --> 03:00.730]  too long to get in the facility. When they searched my backpack, they took some shit
[03:00.730 --> 03:04.270]  away from me. They made me give some things away that I'd planned on taking in, but they
[03:04.270 --> 03:07.990]  wouldn't let me take it in. I wasn't going to wait in line again. That kind of frustrated
[03:07.990 --> 03:13.070]  me. Then when I got in there, the place was so crowded that I literally got stuck in an
[03:13.070 --> 03:17.070]  intersection of people for several minutes and could not go left. I could not go right.
[03:17.070 --> 03:21.310]  I could not go forward, and I could not go backward. I was trapped, and I do not like
[03:21.310 --> 03:26.510]  being trapped. It put me in a little bit of a shitty mood, to tell you the truth. I get
[03:26.510 --> 03:30.950]  out of that big clusterfuck of people, and the first booth I come upon with familiar
[03:30.950 --> 03:35.790]  faces was the Handmade Apparel and Oil Slick booth. I looked at Adam Hand from Handmade
[03:35.790 --> 03:40.190]  Apparel, and the first thing that flew out of my face was, boy, this is a clusterfuck,
[03:40.190 --> 03:44.310]  isn't it? I know now that was the wrong thing to say. That was the wrong mindset. I know
[03:44.310 --> 03:48.630]  that because Adam Hand looked at me, and he said, brother, I came all the way from Washington
[03:48.630 --> 03:53.390]  for this, and look at all these people that are here having a good time. This is amazing.
[03:53.390 --> 03:57.270]  It took me about a half a second to snap out of my shitty mood, and I went, this dude's
[03:57.270 --> 04:01.710]  right. I may have had a shitty parking experience. They may have taken away some cans of butane
[04:01.710 --> 04:05.830]  out of my backpack. I may have taken 10 minutes to stand in an intersection with a bunch of
[04:05.830 --> 04:09.870]  high people doing nothing, trying to figure out which way to go, but he's right. This
[04:09.870 --> 04:14.550]  is an amazing cannabis-themed event, and people from all over the world were there smoking
[04:14.550 --> 04:19.590]  weed with me and my friends. I just needed that quick snap from Adam Hand, and he gave
[04:19.590 --> 04:23.790]  it to me politely and kindly and respectfully. He's a really kind dude, and he's super polite,
[04:23.790 --> 04:27.750]  so I feel like I've been going on about the Handmade Apparel Crew for a really long time.
[04:27.750 --> 04:32.230]  Much respect, much love to the entire Handmade Crew. Big shout out to Adam Hand and his beautiful
[04:32.230 --> 04:38.030]  fiance, Miss Jackie O at the Oil Slick Crew. Yeah, I support that company. I support those
[04:38.030 --> 04:43.070]  people. I love supporting cannabis community members. I'm going to quit kissing their butts
[04:43.070 --> 04:46.190]  now and move forward a little bit. Hey, you guys, thanks for the hoodies. If you're listening,
[04:46.190 --> 04:50.910]  the Handmade Crew, the hoodies look freaking great, you guys. The printing came out so
[04:50.910 --> 04:55.510]  smooth. You guys do a really good job. My iReed Genetics hoodie that I am actually wearing
[04:55.510 --> 04:59.990]  right now, I've probably been wearing this every day it's cold, every day that it's kind
[04:59.990 --> 05:04.830]  of chilly. I wear this probably for like a year now, and the printing is still perfect.
[05:04.830 --> 05:08.950]  The hoodie's getting a little fuzzy because it's getting worn. The stitching, it's got
[05:08.950 --> 05:13.050]  some fuzz marks like it's coming frayed, but bro, the printing is solid still. Every bit
[05:13.050 --> 05:16.990]  of printing on here is good. I'm sure that those Grow From Your Heart hoodies are going
[05:16.990 --> 05:21.530]  to look just as good for just as long. So much love, much respect. I appreciate it.
[05:21.530 --> 05:24.610]  Good job, you guys. I look forward to doing business with you in the future. I need some
[05:24.610 --> 05:28.370]  t-shirts soon. We need some Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts. That's what we need.
[05:28.370 --> 05:31.930]  All right, I'm going to move forward. Ladies and gentlemen, I like to keep the listeners
[05:31.930 --> 05:36.350]  updated on my breeding project. You guys know that I've got a breeding project underway.
[05:36.350 --> 05:41.010]  Just a few days ago, I put pollen on those girls. You can really see the seeds bulking
[05:41.010 --> 05:44.490]  up. It's only been a few days. I'm not sure how far apart those episodes are going to
[05:44.490 --> 05:48.330]  come out, so I'm not going to quote how many days, but it's been several days, a few several
[05:48.330 --> 05:52.870]  days, and the seeds are bulking up. All of the pistils on the plants are really brown
[05:52.870 --> 05:57.250]  and curled up, so you could tell that pollen got in there. I applied so much pollen, you
[05:57.250 --> 06:00.010]  guys. I kind of got a little bit crazy. I put more pollen than I should have, but I
[06:00.010 --> 06:04.210]  wanted to make sure to have a shit ton of seeds, and it is working.
[06:04.210 --> 06:08.610]  So let me give you an update and a reminder of what I bred. I took in a Rise F1 male.
[06:08.610 --> 06:13.970]  This golden goat, the golden goat female, was pollinated by a Daybreaker male that made
[06:13.970 --> 06:19.690]  a Rise. I used that Arise male, and I have pollinated Cookies and Cream, White Widow,
[06:19.690 --> 06:26.010]  Lemon Jeffrey, Grateful Dog, and several other beautiful females. There's a Flow plant in
[06:26.010 --> 06:30.290]  there. They got pollinated also. There are some ... What else is in there? There are
[06:30.290 --> 06:35.730]  other Arise phenotypes in there so that I can make more of the Arise F2.
[06:35.730 --> 06:40.690]  So here in about seven weeks or so, those should be done, and we'll get to see what
[06:40.690 --> 06:45.290]  Cookies and Cream cross to Arise does and what White Widow cross to the Arise will do.
[06:45.290 --> 06:50.490]  My goal, you guys, that Cookies and Cream plant was one of the most resinous, frostiest
[06:50.490 --> 06:55.410]  plants I've ever grown, and the taste on it was great. That plant made some of the best
[06:55.410 --> 07:01.250]  bubble hash and ice hash I have ever smoked, and it yielded really heavy on the shatter.
[07:01.250 --> 07:06.010]  When we make shatter, we would get more shatter than from any other strain, but the problem
[07:06.010 --> 07:13.290]  was if you wanted bud form, it made buds the size of my thumb tip, just like the top of
[07:13.290 --> 07:17.210]  my thumb, just little popcorn balls up the stick, all the way up and down the stick,
[07:17.210 --> 07:21.890]  just little popcorn balls. They're shitty to trim, and it doesn't put out a lot of weight,
[07:21.890 --> 07:25.610]  and the plant's just kind of ... It's just wispy to grow. It's not the best grower.
[07:25.690 --> 07:31.810]  I hit it with the Arise pollen because Arise makes these gigantic, huge colas, and I'm
[07:31.810 --> 07:37.050]  hoping that I can get those giant colas with as much resin and as much flavor and carry
[07:37.050 --> 07:40.930]  that Arise growth trait over to the Cookies and Cream.
[07:40.930 --> 07:47.410]  Now, the Arise females have been testing in the 29 to 31% THCA range, so there's a lot
[07:47.410 --> 07:52.890]  of THC available to put into this cross. I've never had the Cookies and Cream cross tested
[07:52.890 --> 07:56.810]  myself, but I've seen it test high because it's available at Kind Love and several other
[07:56.810 --> 08:04.130]  dispensaries, so I'm hoping I get that really high THC, THCA value on the test there with
[08:04.130 --> 08:05.130]  that cross.
[08:05.130 --> 08:08.930]  So, look forward to that. I'll post pictures of it when those seeds are ready. I will grow
[08:08.930 --> 08:13.150]  them, and then I'll post pictures of that on Instagram. I am ireee underscore genetics
[08:13.150 --> 08:16.490]  on Instagram if you want to check out the progress. There's also a whole bunch of good
[08:16.490 --> 08:19.890]  stuff up on there right now. I'll also let you guys on the podcast know how it's going.
[08:19.890 --> 08:21.970]  So, that's my breeding update.
[08:21.970 --> 08:27.090]  Speaking of updates, I read an email on the last episode from a man who wants to start
[08:27.090 --> 08:33.330]  a cannabis podcast in the UK. Since I read that email, he has responded. I'm not going
[08:33.330 --> 08:37.210]  to read the whole email, but I'll just read a quick portion of it. He says, hey dude,
[08:37.210 --> 08:42.130]  Ross here, messaging off the podcast email address. Great show today. Some great advice,
[08:42.130 --> 08:47.370]  but I must apologize though as I wasn't clear. I actually met Mrs. May, Theresa May, our
[08:47.370 --> 08:52.570]  new female prime minister. Seems she's okay and passionate. And here's where I screwed
[08:52.570 --> 08:55.650]  up you guys. And I knew I was saying something wrong when I said it last time. It felt wrong
[08:55.650 --> 09:01.450]  when I said it, but he said, MP means members of parliament are equivalent to your Congress.
[09:01.450 --> 09:07.090]  And he said, I'm sorry if I'm wrong. He said, are members equivalent to your Congress, I
[09:07.090 --> 09:11.010]  think, and I'm sorry if I'm wrong. However, we do also have a military police, but they're
[09:11.010 --> 09:16.630]  strictly military, nothing political. So, what I said, excuse for the throat clearing,
[09:16.630 --> 09:23.510]  he wrote her a message saying that the prime minister was okay, was possible. I don't remember
[09:23.510 --> 09:26.950]  what the stance was right now because I'm talking too fast, trying to read an email,
[09:26.950 --> 09:33.510]  but he said that the MPs were partial, were supporting cannabis. And I didn't know what
[09:33.510 --> 09:38.670]  MP stood for. And the American in me took it as military police. Then I was just reading
[09:38.670 --> 09:42.590]  an email quickly and trying to come up with a solution quickly. And I spouted out military
[09:42.590 --> 09:48.230]  police and I was wrong as shit. You guys, MP in this dude's meeting stood for members
[09:48.230 --> 09:52.790]  of parliament. So I was wrong. I apologize for that. I hope I didn't embarrass your country.
[09:52.790 --> 09:55.910]  I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much by saying that I wasn't trying to be offensive.
[09:55.910 --> 09:59.590]  So I apologize. And thanks for correcting me. I'd like to be corrected. You guys, I
[09:59.590 --> 10:03.930]  like to be right. If I'm wrong on something, feel free to correct me. And then he also
[10:03.930 --> 10:07.830]  goes on to say, for you to say you're confident that I'm the right person from how I write
[10:07.830 --> 10:12.590]  means a lot as I'm that guy who thinks he sucks at everything. Dude, you don't suck
[10:12.590 --> 10:16.070]  at everything. You're going to be a great podcaster. He also goes on to talk about how
[10:16.070 --> 10:21.070]  he is acquiring equipment and getting his computer ready for the podcast. I look forward
[10:21.070 --> 10:24.870]  to hearing your show. He says he's going to record a couple episodes and send them to
[10:24.870 --> 10:29.970]  me so that I can give him some pointers. Make sure that you get a couple of good episodes
[10:29.970 --> 10:34.550]  recorded. And then when you launch into iTunes, make sure that you get all of your friends
[10:34.550 --> 10:38.550]  to listen. Make sure you have a Twitter account set up so that you can tweet those podcasts
[10:38.550 --> 10:43.270]  out. Maybe start a Twitter account now and start developing relationships with friends
[10:43.270 --> 10:48.530]  on Twitter so that when you do launch material, they'll be there already waiting to retweet
[10:48.530 --> 10:52.830]  your podcast. That's something you could work on. But go ahead. Send me a few episodes when
[10:52.830 --> 10:56.790]  they're ready. I would love to listen to them and give you some guidance. I will do it for
[10:56.790 --> 10:59.950]  you. I would love to do it. I listen to a lot of podcasts. You guys, I spend all day
[10:59.950 --> 11:05.830]  working on plants, so I've always got an earbud in my ear just listening to a podcast.
[11:05.830 --> 11:10.670]  Somebody actually asked me to mention what podcasts I listen to. I've got my phone in
[11:10.670 --> 11:13.750]  my hand. I'll just grab this and I'll scroll through really quickly here. I'll tell you
[11:13.750 --> 11:17.990]  just a few of the podcasts. These are the random emails I get, you guys. People ask
[11:17.990 --> 11:22.830]  me what podcasts are you listening to. I'm going to answer that. I'm just going to go
[11:22.830 --> 11:26.790]  in order from the top. Doug loves movies. Doug loves minis. And then this one's on here,
[11:26.790 --> 11:31.390]  but it may get deleted real soon. It's called Julian loves music. It's really not the greatest
[11:31.390 --> 11:37.990]  podcast. It's a spinoff. It's a copy of Doug loves movies. It's fun sometimes. Of course,
[11:37.990 --> 11:41.310]  the Joe Rogan experience. I listen to that more than anything. The Church of What's Happening
[11:41.310 --> 11:47.090]  Now with Joey Coco Diaz. The Doug Stanhope podcast. The Smartest Man in the World podcast.
[11:47.090 --> 11:52.110]  The Fighter and the Kid. Good Times with Steve Simone. The Ari Shafir Skeptic Tank. Burt
[11:52.110 --> 11:56.390]  Kass podcast with Burt Kreischer. Sometimes that's hard to listen to, you guys, but sometimes
[11:56.390 --> 12:00.830]  there's good episodes. How Comedy Works with Wendy Curtis and Rick Kearns. That's the Comedy
[12:00.830 --> 12:05.470]  Works podcast. The Nerdist. Truth and Eliza. There are a lot more, you guys, but that's
[12:05.470 --> 12:11.110]  mainly what I listen to. I'm getting to the weed section. I've been listening to the Spliff
[12:11.110 --> 12:14.550]  podcast. I used to listen to the Adam Dunn show. I haven't paid attention to that one
[12:14.550 --> 12:18.990]  lately. The Dude Grows is a great podcast. It's in my feed. I don't get a chance to listen
[12:18.990 --> 12:24.450]  to it. Legion of Skanks is good. And then down on the bottom of my list, Monday Morning
[12:24.530 --> 12:29.290]  podcast with Bill Burr and Fitz Dog Radio. And somehow, I'm not sure when I subscribe
[12:29.290 --> 12:33.250]  to this, but Dean Del Rey's Let There Be Talk. Dean Del Rey's a good comedian. He's a rock
[12:33.250 --> 12:37.610]  and roll dude. I don't know if I've ever listened to his podcast, but it's in my feed. So those
[12:37.610 --> 12:40.930]  are the podcasts I'm listening to. All right, let's put the show back on track a little
[12:40.930 --> 12:45.450]  bit and talk a little bit about cannabis. I want to read some listener emails because
[12:45.450 --> 12:49.010]  when the listeners send emails, I know that I'm answering the questions you want to hear
[12:49.010 --> 12:52.850]  and I'm actually getting somebody's attention and helping somebody out. So this one comes
[12:52.850 --> 12:56.770]  from a regular listener and someone that contacts me a lot. This one's from Fastberry.
[12:56.770 --> 13:02.490]  What's up, Fastberry? Good to hear from you again. This email goes like this. As always,
[13:02.490 --> 13:06.370]  really enjoy the podcast. I have a few quick questions for you. And then he did really
[13:06.370 --> 13:09.530]  list a couple of few questions here. We'll see how long these take and then we might
[13:09.530 --> 13:13.970]  read some more emails. We might do a product review. Depends on how much time we have.
[13:13.970 --> 13:19.490]  So the email goes like this. Have you always grown using bottled nutrients and why or why
[13:19.490 --> 13:26.210]  not? Mostly I use bottled nutrients. I prefer the bottled nutrients. It's how I learned.
[13:26.210 --> 13:31.370]  I have reached... Okay, so I guess this is why. I've had my best test results and my
[13:31.370 --> 13:37.450]  best flavor and some of my favorite crops have come from my trusted source of nutrients
[13:37.450 --> 13:43.610]  that I have... I've used so many brands. I have used Advanced Nutrients. I've used Psycho.
[13:43.610 --> 13:50.370]  I have used Fox Farms. I've used Aurora Soul Synthetics. I think that's the name of that stuff.
[13:50.370 --> 13:56.290]  I have used Roots. I don't remember. I may be mixing Aurora and then Soul Synthetics.
[13:56.290 --> 14:00.690]  Those might be two different things. I've used the Roots stuff with the Buddha-looking
[14:00.690 --> 14:07.570]  bottles. I have used Dutch Master. I have used... I've used Dyna-Gro or Pro-Tech. It's
[14:07.570 --> 14:14.930]  Dyna-Gro. I've used so many brands. My favorite, honestly, is Botanicare Pure Blend Pro bottles.
[14:14.930 --> 14:23.570]  The Cocoa Base Grow and Bloom with a little bit of Liquid Karma, some CalMag, whatever.
[14:23.570 --> 14:27.530]  There's a whole line of stuff, but I prefer most of the Botanicare stuff from the Pure
[14:27.530 --> 14:31.810]  Blend Pro line. Then I added a couple other things in there, just a couple of other things
[14:31.810 --> 14:37.050]  that I probably won't mention too much. That's mainly my main mix. There's some Worm
[14:37.050 --> 14:40.010]  Castings in there, and I put in some stuff to get the roots going a little bit. Then
[14:40.010 --> 14:45.010]  I add my own, a couple of little proprietary things in there. I also like a product called
[14:45.010 --> 14:49.810]  Humble Honey if I'm using Botanicare. Put some Humble Honey in there.
[14:49.810 --> 14:54.890]  But those things, from the bottles, I grew a really great crop. Every plant in there
[14:54.890 --> 14:59.490]  got a super high test. Everything tasted amazing, and the weight was where I needed it. So I
[14:59.490 --> 15:02.890]  feel like I fell in love with it. It was like I hit gold, and I don't really want to change
[15:02.890 --> 15:07.410]  from there. A long time ago, I had Sean come on the show, and he started hyping the Organic
[15:07.410 --> 15:12.490]  as Fuck methods. He started showing me a whole bunch. It was great. The product was really
[15:12.490 --> 15:17.070]  great. I had to make too many trips to too many different stores to make that happen
[15:17.070 --> 15:21.610]  for myself. For my lifestyle, it wasn't working. I was working a full-time job. I was running
[15:21.610 --> 15:27.410]  a hundred and something light grow by myself. I didn't have time to hit the Worm Casting
[15:27.410 --> 15:32.050]  store, the Feed store, the Hydro store, and then go to Big R to get tubs to mix all this
[15:32.050 --> 15:36.130]  shit in. It was getting a little overwhelming for me. If you've got time to do it, and
[15:36.130 --> 15:40.490]  you can do that, go for it. But I was running a bottle crop and an organic crop, and it
[15:40.490 --> 15:45.490]  was kind of getting to be a little bit tedious. I live in a house, and I'm not the only one
[15:45.490 --> 15:51.410]  that lives here. Trying to do some of the stinky shit bothered some of the other people.
[15:51.410 --> 15:57.130]  So that wasn't cool. If I lived alone, if I was the only one ever here, because sometimes
[15:57.690 --> 16:02.450]  I mix up a tea and I put some fish emulsion and stuff in there and some Bokashi, and the
[16:02.450 --> 16:07.370]  stuff that comes out of the Kashi bucket, the leachate, the lactic acid bacteria, it
[16:07.370 --> 16:12.130]  stinks up the whole house. If it's in the basement in the back left corner, you can't
[16:12.130 --> 16:15.090]  be in the top story of the house in the top right corner without smelling it, because
[16:15.090 --> 16:20.810]  it is just rank. So that's part of why I don't do the organics at home. I would love, honestly,
[16:20.810 --> 16:25.770]  I've been reading about it and thinking about it. I would love to make this shift to no-till
[16:25.770 --> 16:29.330]  products. I would love to be able to set up some compost in the garage, put a worm
[16:29.330 --> 16:34.170]  farm in the garage, get that sort of a thing going, and then just use... It sounds really
[16:34.170 --> 16:39.930]  awesome to be able to use the same pots for every cycle. Just cut the plant out, shake
[16:39.930 --> 16:44.030]  the roots off, put another plant in there, put some compost in there, some worm castings
[16:44.030 --> 16:47.050]  in there, and get it going again. That sounds amazing.
[16:47.050 --> 16:51.930]  So I have not always grown with bottled nutrients. I've done the organic as fuck method. I've
[16:51.930 --> 16:57.530]  done outdoor stuff that we just did soil. We did amended soil. That sucked. We had one
[16:57.530 --> 17:02.250]  summer where everything got stolen. I've had one... I had... Shit. Okay, I'm going to quit
[17:02.250 --> 17:04.810]  talking about that, because I've had multiple summers where everything got fucking stolen,
[17:04.810 --> 17:10.090]  and that sucks. But all my outdoor stuff was amended soils and no bottled nutrients at
[17:10.090 --> 17:16.050]  all. It's fun. I like the bottles. I like the mad scientist feeling of it, but I also
[17:16.050 --> 17:20.570]  like the amended soils and the teas because of the organic feeling. And I'm a dirty hippie.
[17:20.570 --> 17:25.290]  I got dreadlocks and I like all that natural sort of stuff. So I have not always grown
[17:25.290 --> 17:29.490]  with bottles, and that is kind of why and why not. So I'm going to move on to the next
[17:29.490 --> 17:35.410]  part of your question. Do I like well-made bubble hash? Why or why not? I love some well-made
[17:35.410 --> 17:42.970]  bubble hash. I like some full melt. The Colorado Extract Company makes this. We take... So we'll
[17:42.970 --> 17:49.370]  grow... Not we. A commercial grow will grow plants and take off the big leaves and then
[17:49.410 --> 17:53.690]  freeze the buds. Cut them off the sticks and then freeze the buds while they're still wet.
[17:53.690 --> 17:57.890]  So you've got fresh frozen buds. And you take them to... There are several companies that
[17:57.890 --> 18:02.890]  do it, but Colorado Extract Company made my favorite so far. You take it to these companies
[18:02.890 --> 18:06.370]  and they'd wash it for you. And they keep... The whole time they do it, the whole time
[18:06.370 --> 18:11.450]  they do the extraction, they keep your product at I think it's 55 degrees or it might be
[18:11.450 --> 18:16.250]  65 degrees. They keep it... The room is that cold. Your product is kept on ice the whole
[18:16.250 --> 18:22.290]  time. The hash that comes out of there, it's sold to you. It's kept in a refrigerator at
[18:22.290 --> 18:25.890]  the dispensary. And a lot of people, the hip kids bring a little cooler to buy it because
[18:25.890 --> 18:32.410]  it's sold to you still cool. And the resin heads look like beach sand in the container.
[18:32.410 --> 18:37.970]  That's bubble hash because that's full melt hash. And we'll take that and fold a piece
[18:37.970 --> 18:41.970]  of parchment paper in half and put it in the middle and heat up the carb cap just a little
[18:41.970 --> 18:47.010]  bit and roll a carb cap out on it. And it presses it out and it makes like a little...
[18:47.010 --> 18:50.530]  It looks like a piece of shatter at that point. It's just a little thin layer of hash and
[18:50.530 --> 18:54.490]  you can see through it. And then we take dabs of it like that when it's pressed out and
[18:54.490 --> 18:59.930]  it just burns so much more smoothly. I really... You can tell by the passion in my voice right
[18:59.930 --> 19:04.170]  now that I'm kind of drooling over a nice dab of some good solventless hash. I do love
[19:04.170 --> 19:09.770]  bubble hash if it's done correctly. The problem is there are too many companies not doing
[19:09.770 --> 19:15.450]  it correctly and it's too overpriced and it has to be stored, kept cool. What I do
[19:15.450 --> 19:24.690]  like, they take some of that hash, that really nice 120 or 90 micron bubble hash, and then
[19:24.690 --> 19:29.530]  they press it. They run it through like a rosin press. And the stuff that comes out
[19:29.530 --> 19:35.170]  of that, oh, that is delicious, you guys. It comes out white and it looks like white
[19:35.170 --> 19:39.410]  silly putty or the stuff that I used to use when I was in high school and wanted to put
[19:39.410 --> 19:44.250]  posters on the basement wall, but the wall didn't take nails. It's this weird goo tacky
[19:44.250 --> 19:48.090]  stuff. It looked like that. But the dabs out of it were so amazing. It'd be so tasty and
[19:48.090 --> 19:53.250]  I would get really medicated really quickly from it. It was like a full body high. When
[19:53.250 --> 19:57.170]  you smoke shatter, I don't think it gets to my body as much as I think the solventless
[19:57.170 --> 20:01.130]  does. So yes, obviously I do like that.
[20:01.130 --> 20:07.010]  Can you say, you talk about your favorite strain to breed with, oh, hold on, phone just
[20:07.010 --> 20:12.010]  blacked out. You often talk about your favorite strain to breed with, breed with of to make
[20:12.010 --> 20:18.250]  hash oil, but if you had to pick a desert island 10 pack of seeds, what would they be?
[20:18.250 --> 20:24.610]  Okay, so I think you said that I talk about a lot of my favorite, let's see, because you
[20:24.610 --> 20:28.290]  kind of stumbled on some words there. Talk about your favorite strain to breed with of
[20:28.290 --> 20:32.090]  to make hash oil. But if you had to pick a desert island, 10 pack of seeds, what would
[20:32.090 --> 20:35.810]  they be? So I'm going to take this as if I had to pick 10 seeds, a 10 pack of seeds,
[20:35.810 --> 20:40.210]  what 10 pack would I pick to be on a desert island? Hopefully it's a deserted island because
[20:40.210 --> 20:43.130]  it's on a desert island. It's going to suck trying to grow some cannabis. Hopefully I've
[20:43.130 --> 20:47.530]  got plenty of clean water. Hopefully I can find some stuff to make some organic nutrients.
[20:47.530 --> 20:50.650]  There's going to be fish around if I'm on an island, right? I'll be able to find some
[20:50.650 --> 20:57.050]  fish and make some fish nutrients. 10 pack of seeds. That's really a challenge and see,
[20:57.050 --> 21:00.570]  this is going to frustrate a lot of people because I've got a seed vault of my own that
[21:00.570 --> 21:05.210]  nobody has ever had access to. So probably something like the lemon Jeffrey grateful
[21:05.210 --> 21:09.910]  dog cross is a really good one. I call that lemon sorbet. A 10 pack of that would be really
[21:09.910 --> 21:15.330]  cool if I were stuck on a deserted island. Grateful dog might be the one to pick dude
[21:15.330 --> 21:21.890]  because it's got the flavor, it's got the aroma, it's got that stank. But here's where
[21:21.890 --> 21:25.770]  I'm going to go weird. Grateful dog is feminized seed and I don't want to be stuck on a deserted
[21:25.810 --> 21:33.090]  island with feminized seeds. I want regular seeds so that I can breed. So yeah, that's
[21:33.090 --> 21:38.650]  such a tough choice. Something I've bred probably, it would have to be one of my creations, something
[21:38.650 --> 21:42.770]  regular, something that came from the arise might be cool. You know what? Dubwise might
[21:42.770 --> 21:46.890]  be a good one if I were stuck and people are like, you never even talk about Dubwise. It's
[21:46.890 --> 21:52.770]  easy to grow. It produces huge colas and it's got a couple of good phenotypes. There's like
[21:52.770 --> 21:56.810]  a really hazy phenotype and there's a more indica phenotype, but they all test high in
[21:56.810 --> 22:01.890]  THC. So that would be cool. Uh, but so if the grateful dog were regular seed, that would
[22:01.890 --> 22:06.810]  be my pick because then I could get an OG Cush leaning phenotype, a chem 91 leaning
[22:06.810 --> 22:10.450]  phenotype and then I could get a male and then I could breed and then I could start
[22:10.450 --> 22:14.530]  doing some shit. And if I had a 10 pack of seeds, that's all I need to make magic happen.
[22:14.530 --> 22:19.730]  If you just left me alone on a deserted island, we would have in crosses, we would have out
[22:19.730 --> 22:24.110]  crosses, we would have F sixes. Eventually I would just go nuts with it. So if the grateful
[22:24.110 --> 22:28.890]  dog were regular seed, that would be my first choice. Uh, the lemon Jeffrey grateful dog
[22:28.890 --> 22:33.450]  is also a feminine seed. So all my favorites are becoming feminized. The cascade would
[22:33.450 --> 22:39.210]  be cool. You know, I might have to say arise, arise might be the winner because it's available.
[22:39.210 --> 22:43.250]  I could grab a 10 pack of that right now. But then I start thinking, see, I'm just rambling
[22:43.250 --> 22:48.330]  today. I kind of want to go way old school and say like, why not some old, like brothers
[22:48.330 --> 22:52.710]  grim seeds or some Mr. Nice seeds from way back in the day because that's when stuff
[22:52.710 --> 22:57.050]  was really neat way back then before we started kind of just breeding for a lot of random
[22:57.050 --> 23:01.210]  stuff. The old breeders seem to have more goals in mind. They seem to have more, a more
[23:01.210 --> 23:04.370]  foresight for their breeding. Now it just seems like everybody's breeding for a lot
[23:04.370 --> 23:07.410]  of hype and they're trying to jump on the skittles train or whatever it seems to be
[23:07.410 --> 23:12.490]  next. All right. So speaking of skittles, that leads me right into the next part of
[23:12.490 --> 23:18.090]  your question. Fast. Barry says, I live in Rhode Island and can't really lock, look hard
[23:18.850 --> 23:23.450]  into getting elite clones. If you were me, what cutting should I be looking out for?
[23:23.450 --> 23:29.490]  Well, that's a great question. Um, it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Honestly,
[23:29.490 --> 23:32.890]  if you're looking for like head stash for yourself, you might want one thing. If you're
[23:32.890 --> 23:36.890]  trying to grow some weight, you might want another thing. If you need an Indica, you
[23:36.890 --> 23:41.090]  want one thing. If you need a sativa, you want another thing. Uh, if you are trying
[23:41.090 --> 23:45.830]  to go for flavor, you might want something else right now. What I'm noticing, everything
[23:45.830 --> 23:51.030]  tangy is popular. Uh, strawberry, banana, tangy, double banana tangy. There's a banana
[23:51.030 --> 23:56.710]  sherbet that goes around. Uh, there's a banana split. All of that. Like that Crockett family
[23:56.710 --> 24:01.790]  farm stuff is super popular. The skittles with a Z, I think they're calling it skittles
[24:01.790 --> 24:04.670]  because they can't call it skittles. You know what I'm saying? They got to spell it with
[24:04.670 --> 24:10.070]  a Z. Uh, the skittles is super popular right now. Everybody's loving the skittles. I don't
[24:10.070 --> 24:14.470]  know what's next. I wish I could predict. I wish one of my strains was the next hype,
[24:14.470 --> 24:17.470]  but you can't, you can't just make it the next type. Somebody has got to fall in love
[24:17.470 --> 24:21.170]  with it. It's got to be the next type. So anything with tangy in it, people are really
[24:21.170 --> 24:27.030]  in love with tangy right now. Uh, that strawberry banana tangy type of stuff is really cool.
[24:27.030 --> 24:32.990]  Uh, if you want a really heavy producer straight up tangy works well for you. If you want more
[24:32.990 --> 24:38.070]  of an Indica type of tangy product, I would say the taffy was great. So that's sort of,
[24:38.070 --> 24:42.870]  sort of stuff is what's really popular right now. Uh, it's hard to predict because one
[24:42.870 --> 24:47.550]  day it was girl scout cookies for a long time. It was OG Kush. All you could sell was
[24:47.550 --> 24:51.830]  OG Kush. If you had a bag of OG Kush and a bag of whatever else that OG Kush would sell
[24:51.830 --> 24:55.510]  first, you could buy triple the OG Kush of everything else. Cause you were going to sell
[24:55.510 --> 25:00.350]  that OG. Everyone wanted OG. And then it was girl scout cookies. And then it was gorilla
[25:00.350 --> 25:05.670]  glue and then it was tangy. Uh, and then it was golden goat for a little while before
[25:05.670 --> 25:10.250]  that. So it's hard to predict what's going to be the next hype strain. Um, I guess I
[25:10.330 --> 25:15.810]  hyped up a whole bunch of that Crockett family farm stuff. I could also say maybe, um, what
[25:15.810 --> 25:20.650]  do you want in your garden? You want to rise, you want cascade, you want firefly, you want
[25:20.650 --> 25:25.850]  morning dew, you want, no, those are all strains that I have made. And I am just trying to
[25:25.850 --> 25:30.050]  push my products, which I mean, if you want my stuff, that'd be awesome. I think a rise
[25:30.050 --> 25:33.650]  is a really reliable strain. So that's something you want in your garden. Let's see. You said
[25:33.650 --> 25:39.210]  you're in Rhode Island. I'm pretty sure I know some, uh, activists and cannabis consumers
[25:39.210 --> 25:43.610]  up in that area. And I am sure that they've got some elite cuts. So get in touch with
[25:43.610 --> 25:47.050]  me. I will try to put you in touch with some people. And that way, if you need a couple
[25:47.050 --> 25:51.530]  of elites, we can put some good stuff in your hands. I'm all about clone trading. I don't
[25:51.530 --> 25:56.050]  think people should clone hoard. I think, uh, sometimes I will keep some stuff back
[25:56.050 --> 26:00.890]  because I'm a breeder and I don't want everything out because I'm going to breed to things.
[26:00.890 --> 26:06.250]  And that's kind of my magic. But once I give a clone out, I try not to say, Hey, don't
[26:06.250 --> 26:10.610]  give that out to people. I feel like once I've given a clone out you, that clone's going
[26:10.610 --> 26:14.630]  places. I, and I know guys that if you tell them, Hey, don't give this out. The first
[26:14.630 --> 26:17.010]  thing they're going to do is go, Oh yeah. And they're going to give you the middle finger
[26:17.010 --> 26:20.690]  and they're going to make as many clones of that plant as they possibly can. So I'm all
[26:20.690 --> 26:25.410]  about free trade cloning. I think everybody should have a clone exchange. Uh, I'm down
[26:25.410 --> 26:28.890]  to trade seeds for clones. I'm down to trade clones for clones. I'm down to trade clones
[26:28.890 --> 26:32.410]  for seeds. I like that kind of stuff. I think it should keep moving. I think that's how
[26:32.410 --> 26:37.090]  people find the perfect strain for themselves and their gardens and or their medical patients.
[26:37.090 --> 26:41.170]  I think clone trading should happen. So if I can find somebody in your area or if you
[26:41.170 --> 26:44.290]  can find somebody in your area, wherever you are, whoever you are, if you could find somebody
[26:44.290 --> 26:47.970]  to trade clones with, I highly encourage it. Just make sure that when you get home that
[26:47.970 --> 26:52.970]  you treat those clones for pests and you also quarantine them to keep them away from the
[26:52.970 --> 26:56.850]  rest of your garden for a few days so that if there is something wrong, you don't go
[26:56.850 --> 27:02.350]  infesting the rest of your garden. All right, that was a long rant. I hope I kind of answered
[27:02.350 --> 27:05.990]  your question on what cuttings you should be looking for. Any of that crocket stuff,
[27:05.990 --> 27:10.670]  any I read genetic stuff. Also, alien rock candy has been real popular. So if there's
[27:10.670 --> 27:15.150]  alien rock candy available, grab that. It's been real popular here in Colorado lately.
[27:15.150 --> 27:19.310]  All right, so fast burial. Let's see what else he has to say. He said, sorry for so
[27:19.310 --> 27:25.030]  many questions. It's just a few of the thoughts around the old noggin. The last podcast, my
[27:25.030 --> 27:28.670]  address is no, I'm just kidding. He does give me his address so that I can send him some
[27:28.670 --> 27:32.550]  stickers and stuff, but I won't bust you out and read that on the show. I do want to
[27:32.550 --> 27:35.670]  thank you once again for sending me an email. We've been friends online for quite a while
[27:35.670 --> 27:39.710]  now and I do appreciate the interaction. If anybody out there has a question or they'd
[27:39.710 --> 27:43.430]  like to say something, feel free to send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[27:43.430 --> 27:48.830]  I would love to hear from you. Yes, I do have a ton of emails to respond to. I plan on answering
[27:48.830 --> 27:53.190]  as many of them as I can on the show. I've got messages from Instagram. I've got messages
[27:53.190 --> 27:56.990]  from Facebook. I've got a ton of emails. I'm working my way through them. I can only put
[27:56.990 --> 28:01.030]  out so much content. I've secretly been working on another project that in a few days here,
[28:01.030 --> 28:04.030]  I may make an announcement about, but right now I need to keep that under wraps, but it's
[28:04.030 --> 28:08.270]  been taking a lot of my time. So that's why there was a, not a Thursday episode this week.
[28:08.270 --> 28:12.950]  I took last Thursday off for the Thanksgiving holiday. There was not a Thursday episode
[28:12.950 --> 28:15.870]  for two weeks in a row now, but I will get those coming again. Once I get back on my
[28:15.870 --> 28:19.790]  schedule, I got kind of, I got something else going. It took up a lot of my time. I'm back
[28:19.790 --> 28:24.470]  on the flow now, so I'll be able to put out more regular quality episodes again. Again,
[28:24.470 --> 28:27.670]  if you want to hear something, if you've got a question, a comment, just feel free
[28:27.670 --> 28:34.630]  sending me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to hear from you. All right.
[28:34.630 --> 28:37.990]  I want to take a second and tell you guys about a service called Patreon. I recently
[28:37.990 --> 28:42.110]  made a Patreon account for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. If you want to check it out,
[28:42.110 --> 28:50.630]  it is patreon.com slash grow from your heart. Patreon is P A T R E O N. So it's patreon.com
[28:50.630 --> 28:56.110]  slash grow from your heart. What Patreon is, is a service that will allow my listeners
[28:56.110 --> 29:02.150]  to donate financial contributions to the podcast to help me pay for the web hosting of this
[29:02.150 --> 29:07.190]  show. Ladies and gentlemen, I read genetics, colorado.com costs a little over $300 per
[29:07.190 --> 29:11.270]  year for me to keep up. And that is where all of the podcasts are hosts. There are a
[29:11.270 --> 29:17.110]  hundred episodes there. I am just trying to offset that financial burden out of my pocket
[29:17.110 --> 29:21.310]  by asking the listeners to contribute to my Patreon account. You can contribute as
[29:21.310 --> 29:25.750]  little as $1 per month. And I do not think there is a limit. I think you can put as many
[29:25.750 --> 29:29.430]  zeros on the end of that as you would like. So I would appreciate it if you would sign
[29:29.430 --> 29:33.510]  up at Patreon, if you feel like this podcast is giving you some value, if you've learned
[29:33.510 --> 29:37.310]  something, if you've been entertained, $1 a month is all I ask. I'm not begging. If
[29:37.310 --> 29:41.310]  it's something you can do, that is excellent. I'm just trying to offset the cost of my website
[29:41.310 --> 29:45.930]  so that we can keep the show up for free. The sponsorships do help. I've got some sponsors
[29:45.930 --> 29:50.250]  on board now that really helps a lot. But if you'd like to go to the Patreon account,
[29:50.250 --> 29:54.170]  it is patreon.com slash grow from your heart. Go check out the page. Even if you don't want
[29:54.170 --> 29:57.330]  to contribute, go check out what I did. Go check out what I wrote. I would love your
[29:57.330 --> 30:01.210]  clicks on the website. Speaking of clicks on websites, I'd love it if you follow me
[30:01.210 --> 30:05.370]  on Facebook, check out the grow from your heart podcast on Facebook. Also find me on
[30:05.370 --> 30:09.930]  Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. And I would love it if you follow me on Instagram, where
[30:09.930 --> 30:16.330]  I post a whole bunch of great cannabis photography. Check me out. It's irie underscore genetics.
[30:16.330 --> 30:20.170]  I would love to see you there. All right. I want to thank everybody once again for listening.
[30:20.170 --> 30:25.010]  I want to give a huge shout out to my boy Hydro in Vegas. Bro, that mustache is rocking.
[30:25.010 --> 30:28.170]  I also want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence. And until next time, take a
[30:28.170 --> 30:52.770]  fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
