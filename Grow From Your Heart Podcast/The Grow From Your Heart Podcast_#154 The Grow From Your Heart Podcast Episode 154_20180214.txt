[00:01.980 --> 00:22.600]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 154 of the Grow From
[00:22.600 --> 00:26.400]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.760]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.760 --> 00:34.920]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.920 --> 00:40.440]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:40.440 --> 00:43.880]  host, my friends, call me Ross DeGeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.400]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.400 --> 00:52.200]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic
[00:52.200 --> 00:58.040]  Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, this podcast was recorded live at Elevate Glass Gallery
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.800]  at 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs. This episode features the dabbing granny. It also
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.160]  features the owner and proprietor of Elevate Glass, Miss Rebecca. And we also have two
[01:08.160 --> 01:12.600]  of the Elevate dolls with us. We've got Abby and Lydia joining us on mic. You guys, I've
[01:12.600 --> 01:15.400]  got a wicked head cold, so I'm not going to talk too much at the start of the show.
[01:15.400 --> 01:18.600]  I hope you don't notice my head cold too much in the episode, but I'm going to let the music
[01:18.600 --> 01:22.600]  play for a couple of seconds. And when we get back, we will be at Elevate Glass.
[01:22.600 --> 01:31.160]  All right. I have hit record, so everybody behave yourselves. Don't say anything that
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.560]  you wouldn't want your mom and your friends to hear now.
[01:33.560 --> 01:35.240]  Good thing my mom's really rad.
[01:35.240 --> 01:36.600]  Is your mom really rad?
[01:36.600 --> 01:38.440]  She's super, super, super rad.
[01:38.440 --> 01:39.640]  Is your mom a cannabis consumer?
[01:40.040 --> 01:43.880]  I mean, like low key, you know.
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.480]  Well, everybody knows now, so high key.
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.680]  Oh, that was really funny.
[01:49.480 --> 01:49.720]  Whoa.
[01:49.720 --> 01:50.520]  That was funny.
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.840]  All right. So, have you ever smoked with your mom?
[01:53.560 --> 01:54.280]  I have, yeah.
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.000]  You have? Does she know what you are doing here in Colorado?
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.280]  Yes, she does. She actually loves it. She came to the shop not too long ago when she was here
[02:00.280 --> 02:00.760]  visiting.
[02:00.760 --> 02:03.160]  Oh, very cool. Very cool. Shout out to Lydia's mom.
[02:03.160 --> 02:03.800]  Holla.
[02:03.800 --> 02:05.080]  Lydia, we'll get back to you in just a second.
[02:05.080 --> 02:05.720]  Yeah, Tina.
[02:05.720 --> 02:08.680]  I'm going to introduce everybody left to right. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:08.680 --> 02:09.800]  welcome back to the podcast.
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.800]  We are here live at the beautiful Elevate Glass in downtown Colorado Springs.
[02:13.800 --> 02:15.880]  We are at 517 South Tejon.
[02:15.880 --> 02:17.240]  This place looks great.
[02:17.240 --> 02:21.880]  The shelves are stocked with, I'm looking at silver surfer vaporizers.
[02:21.880 --> 02:24.120]  That's hard to say when you're this dabbed out.
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.160]  They're custom painted.
[02:25.160 --> 02:26.200]  They're colorful as shit.
[02:26.200 --> 02:28.200]  There are some really cool dab straws up there.
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.640]  There are hammer pipes behind me.
[02:29.640 --> 02:32.840]  We've got a whole bunch of super colorful hand pipes.
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.360]  On the shelf in front of me, we've got a bunch of custom recyclers.
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.480]  Who made that orange? Is that Serendipity?
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.320]  Serendipity, Matt Zimmerman.
[02:41.320 --> 02:43.880]  Matt Zimmerman. Awesome. That's a great piece. I love it.
[02:43.880 --> 02:45.000]  The great selection here, you guys.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.160]  Come to Elevate Glass 517 South Tejon and check out all of the lovely glass.
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.160]  And also check out the Elevate dolls.
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.480]  There will be some lovely ladies here to help you out.
[02:53.480 --> 02:57.000]  I'm going to introduce all the lovely ladies that are on the podcast to my left.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.320]  A repeat offender, a returning champion.
[02:59.320 --> 03:01.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the podcast.
[03:01.080 --> 03:03.160]  My great new friend, the dad and granny.
[03:03.160 --> 03:05.160]  Thank you so much for having me, Jeff.
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.360]  Thanks for putting this together, Gail.
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.800]  This is your idea and I appreciate it.
[03:07.800 --> 03:08.920]  It's a good time, isn't it?
[03:08.920 --> 03:10.040]  It is a great time.
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.560]  Granny, just in case people don't know,
[03:11.560 --> 03:14.360]  remind everybody out there how they can follow you on social media
[03:14.360 --> 03:16.840]  so that they can check you out while they're listening to your sexy voice.
[03:16.840 --> 03:20.440]  I'm on Instagram, dabbing underscore granny.
[03:21.160 --> 03:24.360]  I'm on Facebook, dabbing granny.
[03:24.360 --> 03:27.720]  I'm on YouTube, dabbing granny.
[03:28.280 --> 03:30.520]  I'm on Periscope, dabbing granny.
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.000]  You guys, if you search for dabbing granny, this lady will pop up.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.920]  She is amazing. She takes giant dabs.
[03:34.920 --> 03:35.880]  She will take a dab.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.840]  She will chug a beer.
[03:36.840 --> 03:37.720]  She'll chug a shot.
[03:37.720 --> 03:40.360]  Then she'll do a bong rip and then she'll blow out her smoke.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.400]  That's what shows up.
[03:41.400 --> 03:42.840]  She is a savage.
[03:42.840 --> 03:44.600]  She's also a huge member of this community.
[03:44.600 --> 03:46.680]  She does a lot of events and supports this community.
[03:46.680 --> 03:49.560]  She's got an event coming up that we will talk about here in a few minutes.
[03:49.560 --> 03:51.000]  Granny, thanks for being on the show again.
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.200]  Thanks for having me, Jeff.
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.960]  And sitting to the left of the beautiful dabbing granny is the also beautiful V.
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.600]  Are you the owner and proprietor of this fine establishment?
[03:58.600 --> 03:59.000]  Yes.
[03:59.000 --> 03:59.640]  Yes. Awesome.
[03:59.640 --> 04:00.280]  This is a great place.
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.800]  Thanks for letting me come to a podcast here.
[04:01.800 --> 04:02.600]  Thanks for inviting me.
[04:02.600 --> 04:03.560]  Thanks for being on the show with us.
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[04:05.160 --> 04:07.080]  Rebecca from Elevate Glass.
[04:07.080 --> 04:07.320]  Hey.
[04:08.120 --> 04:09.320]  There should be huge applause right there.
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.280]  I'll put in some sound effects.
[04:10.280 --> 04:11.000]  There'll be huge applause.
[04:11.000 --> 04:11.960]  It'll sound like a stadium.
[04:12.680 --> 04:14.600]  Just so that everybody can stalk you on social media,
[04:14.600 --> 04:16.120]  tell them how they can find you on Instagram
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.880]  and wherever else they might want to stalk you.
[04:17.880 --> 04:20.360]  I am QueenRebecula on Instagram.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.960]  Will you spell Rebecula?
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.720]  R-E-B-E-C-U-L-A.
[04:25.720 --> 04:27.000]  Nice. QueenRebecula.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.680]  Is there an underscore or anything in there?
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.720]  No, it's all one word.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.600]  All right, you guys follow her.
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.000]  Check her out.
[04:31.000 --> 04:31.560]  Give her a follow.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.600]  Let her know that you found her
[04:32.600 --> 04:34.360]  on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:34.360 --> 04:35.720]  Throw up a Grow From Your Heart hashtag
[04:35.720 --> 04:36.920]  on one of her pictures or something.
[04:36.920 --> 04:38.600]  Let her know that that's how you're stalking her.
[04:38.600 --> 04:40.120]  She's doing a little hashtag hand signal.
[04:40.120 --> 04:41.880]  I didn't know there was a gang sign for hashtag.
[04:42.440 --> 04:43.880]  I'm going to fucking make that official.
[04:43.880 --> 04:45.640]  I'm going to start throwing that shit up.
[04:45.640 --> 04:46.760]  Hashtag.
[04:46.760 --> 04:47.960]  Hashtag, hashtag.
[04:47.960 --> 04:48.280]  That's it.
[04:48.280 --> 04:49.800]  We're the hashtag crew.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.760]  Hashtag elevate.
[04:50.760 --> 04:53.080]  Hashtag Tookus may be the hashtag for this show.
[04:54.520 --> 04:55.080]  I like it.
[04:55.080 --> 04:55.800]  I like it.
[04:55.800 --> 04:58.520]  There's a little bit of pre-show conversation there.
[04:58.520 --> 04:59.720]  All right, thank you for joining me, Rebecca.
[04:59.720 --> 05:00.760]  Thanks for letting us record here.
[05:00.760 --> 05:01.960]  Thanks for having me.
[05:01.960 --> 05:03.720]  Directly in front of me, staring at me.
[05:04.440 --> 05:04.940]  Yes.
[05:06.760 --> 05:07.320]  Oh, you're cool.
[05:07.320 --> 05:07.800]  I'll move this.
[05:07.800 --> 05:08.360]  We're all right.
[05:08.360 --> 05:09.160]  We're all right.
[05:09.160 --> 05:09.560]  All right.
[05:09.560 --> 05:09.800]  All right.
[05:09.800 --> 05:10.920]  We're still good.
[05:10.920 --> 05:12.360]  We're just yanking mic cables and everything, guys.
[05:12.360 --> 05:13.000]  Don't worry.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.440]  Sitting directly in front of me.
[05:14.440 --> 05:15.480]  Do we call you Dabigail?
[05:15.480 --> 05:16.280]  Are you Abby?
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.640]  I am Dabigail.
[05:17.640 --> 05:18.600]  You are Dabigail.
[05:18.600 --> 05:18.840]  Yes.
[05:18.840 --> 05:20.280]  Is that how they find you on Instagram?
[05:20.280 --> 05:21.960]  Yes, Dabigail6.
[05:21.960 --> 05:24.360]  You do a lot of Snapchatting.
[05:24.360 --> 05:26.040]  Do you want people to follow your Snapchat?
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.560]  They can follow me on Snapchat.
[05:27.560 --> 05:30.120]  I think I'm on Snapchat as Newman6.
[05:30.120 --> 05:30.840]  That sounds right.
[05:30.840 --> 05:31.560]  I think so.
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.200]  Newman6.
[05:32.200 --> 05:33.400]  Follow her on Snapchat, you guys.
[05:33.400 --> 05:34.200]  That's not creepy.
[05:34.840 --> 05:35.800]  That sounds right.
[05:35.800 --> 05:36.360]  You know.
[05:37.960 --> 05:38.920]  Pass the mic over here.
[05:38.920 --> 05:39.720]  Let's-
[05:39.720 --> 05:40.440]  You totally know.
[05:40.440 --> 05:42.840]  Wow, you've got a troll.
[05:42.840 --> 05:43.480]  Yeah.
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.000]  Usually I'm the one trolling people.
[05:45.000 --> 05:45.560]  What's with you, Lydia?
[05:45.560 --> 05:46.600]  No, you have competition, Jeff.
[05:46.600 --> 05:46.920]  Come on.
[05:46.920 --> 05:47.160]  I like it.
[05:47.160 --> 05:47.560]  Step it up.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.360]  I like it.
[05:48.360 --> 05:51.240]  You were the first person that I met the first time I ever came into Elevate.
[05:51.240 --> 05:52.600]  Yeah, I specifically remember.
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.360]  I actually met you like two or three times before anybody else had the pleasure of really like-
[05:56.360 --> 05:56.600]  Yeah.
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.080]  Knowing.
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.960]  And then I finally came in and a whole bunch of girls came from the back and gave me
[05:59.960 --> 06:01.480]  a giant hug and they're like, we've heard about you.
[06:01.480 --> 06:03.080]  And I was like, this is like one of the coolest things that's ever happened to me.
[06:03.080 --> 06:05.320]  I do remember the girl hug with Jeff.
[06:05.320 --> 06:06.040]  I do remember.
[06:06.040 --> 06:06.920]  There was a Snapchat picture.
[06:06.920 --> 06:07.480]  There was.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.760]  Yeah, I do remember.
[06:08.760 --> 06:12.680]  So ladies and gentlemen, who we're talking to is Miss Lydia from Elevate Glass.
[06:12.680 --> 06:13.800]  Do you have an Instagram page?
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.320]  I do, yeah.
[06:15.880 --> 06:17.000]  But it's just my name.
[06:17.000 --> 06:17.880]  It's really boring.
[06:17.880 --> 06:19.000]  I feel like I need to change it.
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.040]  Is it your full name?
[06:20.040 --> 06:20.920]  Yeah, it is.
[06:20.920 --> 06:22.680]  Tell them your full name so they can stop you.
[06:22.680 --> 06:23.240]  Oh, come on.
[06:23.240 --> 06:23.720]  It's got-
[06:23.720 --> 06:24.840]  I'm like super German.
[06:26.200 --> 06:27.880]  Okay, Lydia Renninger.
[06:27.880 --> 06:34.760]  So it's L-Y-D-Y-A-R-E-N-N-I-N-G-E-R.
[06:34.760 --> 06:35.400]  That's not that hard.
[06:35.400 --> 06:36.040]  All one word.
[06:36.600 --> 06:37.480]  All one word.
[06:37.480 --> 06:38.360]  I know, it's really hard.
[06:38.360 --> 06:38.600]  Come up-
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.880]  You spelled Lydia right because nobody ever spells Lydia right.
[06:39.880 --> 06:40.840]  Yeah, nobody ever spells it right.
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.040]  L-Y-D-Y-A.
[06:42.600 --> 06:44.680]  Okay, come up with a good name for me.
[06:44.680 --> 06:51.720]  All day long, I was posting about this podcast and I knew Lydia was going to be here,
[06:52.520 --> 06:54.600]  but I didn't know what to tag her.
[06:54.600 --> 06:56.680]  So I just didn't put her in the picture.
[06:58.840 --> 06:59.640]  I know.
[06:59.640 --> 07:01.480]  It wasn't that I don't love you.
[07:01.480 --> 07:01.880]  I know.
[07:01.880 --> 07:02.280]  I do.
[07:02.280 --> 07:03.160]  I know you do love me.
[07:03.160 --> 07:04.520]  What's easier than just her name?
[07:04.520 --> 07:06.760]  Also, that's the most simple tag you can find.
[07:06.760 --> 07:09.640]  I could have done hashtag.
[07:09.640 --> 07:10.520]  You're absolutely right.
[07:10.520 --> 07:12.280]  She's throwing up hashtag gang signs again.
[07:12.280 --> 07:13.880]  I love the gang sign for hashtag.
[07:13.880 --> 07:15.480]  That's my new favorite thing for the day.
[07:15.480 --> 07:16.440]  Lydia, thanks for joining me.
[07:16.440 --> 07:17.880]  Thanks for always treating me great.
[07:17.880 --> 07:21.880]  It's because of you that I kept coming back to this place because there are tons of glass shops.
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.600]  Thanks, guys.
[07:22.600 --> 07:25.080]  And of course, dude, I love you, Rasta Jeff.
[07:25.080 --> 07:25.800]  Always have.
[07:25.800 --> 07:31.400]  From the moment your immense height walked into the building and I realized how really
[07:31.400 --> 07:33.400]  small I was, I liked him.
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.600]  No, I think you're average.
[07:34.600 --> 07:36.360]  I think I'm just above average in height.
[07:36.360 --> 07:36.860]  I'm pretty short.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.840]  I mean, I thought I was teeny.
[07:40.840 --> 07:44.280]  We pride ourselves on our customer service, so that makes me really happy.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.080]  You guys do a great job.
[07:45.080 --> 07:46.040]  You ladies do a great job.
[07:46.040 --> 07:48.760]  Are there any men that work here at the Elevate stores?
[07:48.760 --> 07:49.080]  One.
[07:49.080 --> 07:50.280]  Currently one.
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.720]  And there's about to be three.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.240]  Oh, you're going to change things.
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.440]  I've only seen one male ever that has worked here ever before.
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.080]  Oh, yeah?
[07:57.080 --> 07:57.480]  Yeah.
[07:57.480 --> 07:58.280]  Brandon is his name.
[07:58.280 --> 07:58.920]  Yes, Brandon.
[07:58.920 --> 07:59.160]  Yes.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.040]  How do you do?
[08:00.040 --> 08:00.600]  Was he all right?
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.040]  You know, we were all, it was the day that I came and it was super busy and we just hung out.
[08:04.040 --> 08:06.280]  So he had like, you know, had nothing to judge him on.
[08:06.280 --> 08:07.240]  He was a great guy.
[08:07.240 --> 08:09.800]  He gave me a high five and we talked about Instagram.
[08:09.800 --> 08:10.360]  He's the best.
[08:10.360 --> 08:11.240]  He really is the best.
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.440]  We're all about those high fives.
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.400]  I love fucking with him.
[08:13.400 --> 08:16.040]  Are there other ladies that usually work here that we should give a shout out to?
[08:16.600 --> 08:18.280]  Heidi and Mac Daddy.
[08:18.280 --> 08:19.720]  Oh, Mac Daddy, without a doubt.
[08:19.720 --> 08:20.120]  Oh, yeah.
[08:20.120 --> 08:21.240]  What's up, Daddy Mac?
[08:21.240 --> 08:21.320]  We love you, Mac Daddy.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.280]  Yeah, why aren't you here?
[08:22.280 --> 08:22.760]  We miss you.
[08:22.760 --> 08:23.720]  We wish you were here.
[08:23.720 --> 08:24.360]  We miss Heidi.
[08:24.360 --> 08:25.480]  We miss all our counterparts.
[08:25.480 --> 08:25.960]  And Heidi.
[08:25.960 --> 08:27.480]  Heidi's the tall one with the dark hair.
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.120]  And the tattoos and the beautifully, like, ornate artwork.
[08:32.120 --> 08:35.960]  I've only had the pleasure of working with her once and she's kind of quiet, but she is super great.
[08:35.960 --> 08:36.520]  She is.
[08:36.520 --> 08:37.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:37.240 --> 08:38.040]  She's really unique.
[08:38.040 --> 08:41.320]  Until you get her out of her shell, then she's not so quiet.
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.760]  Okay, well, I'll get her out of that shell one time.
[08:42.760 --> 08:43.480]  Well, she's super smart.
[08:43.480 --> 08:46.040]  Like, she teaches me shit that I never ever would have any idea.
[08:46.040 --> 08:46.760]  What did she teach you?
[08:47.480 --> 08:52.920]  That mycelium is actually the real word for mushrooms and that they're growing under, like,
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.320]  these giant interwebs under the ground and that they feel everything and, like, mushrooms are
[08:57.320 --> 08:58.280]  the birth of everything.
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.360]  And we're only 50% away from being having the same DNA.
[09:02.360 --> 09:02.840]  Did you know that?
[09:02.840 --> 09:04.040]  And she's all about...
[09:04.040 --> 09:04.760]  That's amazing shit.
[09:04.760 --> 09:05.960]  I did not know all of that.
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.760]  No, Google that.
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.920]  It's, like, legit because I called BS.
[09:08.920 --> 09:09.800]  I was like, are you for real?
[09:09.800 --> 09:10.680]  I'm just going to put the mics down.
[09:10.680 --> 09:11.800]  I got my computer right behind me.
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.240]  We're just going to go Google some mushroom stuff.
[09:13.240 --> 09:14.680]  We'll catch up with you guys a little bit later.
[09:14.680 --> 09:15.400]  Thanks for listening.
[09:15.400 --> 09:15.900]  Heck yeah.
[09:17.320 --> 09:20.440]  She's all about medieval psychedelics, too.
[09:20.440 --> 09:25.400]  And she has, like, some, um, like, slav, slave, however you say it.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.120]  Sav?
[09:26.120 --> 09:26.620]  Sav.
[09:30.360 --> 09:31.400]  All the right letters.
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.280]  All of the right letters.
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.400]  We may have taken a bunch of dabs and Rebecca doesn't dab, but I think a couple of us blew
[09:37.400 --> 09:38.280]  them at her.
[09:38.280 --> 09:40.680]  And I think she, uh, she, her eyes are a little pinkish.
[09:40.680 --> 09:41.180]  Yeah.
[09:44.920 --> 09:46.200]  She might be a little medicated now.
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.120]  But she just made some psychedelic.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.280]  Some rub that you can rub on your arms and get, and get psychedelic?
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.160]  Dude, she's magical.
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.120]  She's magic.
[09:54.120 --> 09:54.920]  She has some energy.
[09:54.920 --> 09:55.800]  She definitely has some energy.
[09:55.800 --> 09:56.920]  Have you tried that magical slav?
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.560]  I have not tried it.
[09:57.560 --> 09:58.760]  That magical slave?
[09:58.760 --> 09:59.320]  Magical slave.
[09:59.320 --> 10:01.080]  That magical slave.
[10:01.080 --> 10:03.000]  She into BDSM, too?
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.600]  Granny's heating up a nectar collector.
[10:05.160 --> 10:09.240]  Dude, she did work at that creepy, um, uh, what is it?
[10:09.240 --> 10:10.840]  The adult arcade.
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.200]  Yeah, it's like a porn store and an arcade.
[10:14.200 --> 10:15.480]  We call that a shooting gallery.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.440]  Yeah, it's on Platte right by the black sheep.
[10:18.440 --> 10:19.400]  It's like the adult arcade.
[10:19.400 --> 10:20.360]  That's kind of gross.
[10:20.360 --> 10:21.080]  That was swift.
[10:21.080 --> 10:22.280]  That's kind of gross.
[10:22.280 --> 10:23.880]  I wish, I kind of wish I wouldn't have said that now.
[10:25.320 --> 10:26.520]  I call it a shooting gallery.
[10:28.680 --> 10:30.360]  I think that's hilarious.
[10:30.360 --> 10:32.520]  The look on Rebecca's face is priceless right now.
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.480]  All right, let's talk more about cannabis because, uh, this got weird really quickly.
[10:38.200 --> 10:40.200]  Who here is not from Colorado?
[10:41.240 --> 10:42.680]  Uh, yeah, me.
[10:42.680 --> 10:44.680]  Rebecca's the only one that's a Colorado native?
[10:44.680 --> 10:45.560]  Colorado native.
[10:46.440 --> 10:46.940]  Nice.
[10:46.940 --> 10:49.160]  I think, oh, Granny, you're from the Corn, right?
[10:49.160 --> 10:49.720]  That's right.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.520]  I'm an Iowa Corn whore.
[10:50.520 --> 10:51.720]  She's an Iowa Corn whore.
[10:51.720 --> 10:52.920]  You guys, she said corn whore.
[10:52.920 --> 10:54.760]  I just repeated it because she didn't have a microphone.
[10:55.800 --> 10:57.000]  These ladies are the best.
[10:57.560 --> 10:59.240]  Miss Dabigail, where are you from, honey?
[10:59.240 --> 10:59.960]  Chicago.
[10:59.960 --> 11:01.000]  Chicago.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.280]  What brought you to Colorado?
[11:02.840 --> 11:04.520]  Uh, my sister was out here.
[11:04.520 --> 11:06.360]  Okay, did she come out for cannabis?
[11:06.360 --> 11:09.000]  No, we actually had never been here and she loved it here.
[11:09.000 --> 11:09.320]  Okay.
[11:09.320 --> 11:10.280]  And then she left me here.
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.320]  So she left you here.
[11:11.320 --> 11:12.440]  Now I'm here by myself.
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.080]  Oh, you're not alone.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.120]  For your family.
[11:14.120 --> 11:14.600]  Yeah.
[11:14.600 --> 11:17.480]  I have the Elevate dolls taken over.
[11:17.480 --> 11:19.240]  And the whole cannabis community is your friend now.
[11:19.240 --> 11:21.480]  You've got so many followers on Instagram and Snapchat.
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.280]  You got friends.
[11:22.280 --> 11:22.920]  Yes, I do.
[11:22.920 --> 11:23.800]  You're not alone.
[11:23.800 --> 11:25.400]  Don't you have a cool ass dog?
[11:25.400 --> 11:26.840]  I have the best dog.
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.440]  Yeah, see, I pay attention.
[11:28.440 --> 11:29.720]  Shout out to the dog.
[11:29.720 --> 11:33.480]  Abby, when I threw up that picture of you and I the other day,
[11:34.040 --> 11:36.600]  there was like, oh, Granny, I'm jealous.
[11:37.320 --> 11:38.280]  Did you see?
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.040]  Some guy was like, tell her she's hot.
[11:40.040 --> 11:43.480]  Yeah, there was a lot of comments about you, Miss Abby.
[11:44.600 --> 11:46.360]  Yeah, that picture got me a lot of attention.
[11:46.360 --> 11:47.400]  You made her blush, Granny.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.960]  She said she got a lot of followers.
[11:49.960 --> 11:50.280]  I did.
[11:50.280 --> 11:51.320]  She's a very beautiful young lady.
[11:51.320 --> 11:52.120]  A lot of followers.
[11:52.680 --> 11:54.760]  And she's as beautiful inside as she is out.
[11:55.480 --> 11:56.200]  Hell yeah.
[11:56.200 --> 11:57.000]  Second act.
[11:57.000 --> 11:57.500]  Aw.
[11:58.360 --> 12:00.040]  We just had a moment here in Elevate.
[12:03.080 --> 12:03.960]  Oh, yeah, we do have.
[12:03.960 --> 12:06.440]  Oh, they've all got the Elevate tattoo on the thumb.
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.000]  That's awesome.
[12:07.960 --> 12:11.080]  You know, I got to mention this since you're talking about the Elevate logo.
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.440]  These ladies were kind enough to gift me a dope new recycler, a new dab rig.
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.560]  The base has the Rasta colored Elevate logo around it a few times.
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.200]  It's got the red, golden, green Elevate logo down the what's this called?
[12:26.200 --> 12:28.520]  You guys are all the recycler part, right?
[12:28.520 --> 12:29.560]  OK, what would you call it?
[12:29.560 --> 12:30.360]  Yeah, never mind.
[12:30.360 --> 12:31.960]  You guys are just as technical as I was going to be.
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.360]  The mouthpiece has the Elevate logo with the Colorado sea with the seed coming out of it.
[12:38.360 --> 12:44.440]  And then over here on the back kind of left side is a sprouting ganja seed.
[12:44.440 --> 12:46.600]  You guys, they kind of oh, I forgot the coolest part.
[12:46.600 --> 12:49.000]  Shit, I got to keep spinning directly in front of me.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.720]  Now I'm looking at a lion of Judah, a red, yellow and green lion with some stars on it.
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.320]  It doesn't get any better than this.
[12:55.320 --> 12:57.320]  They made me a custom rig, you guys.
[12:57.320 --> 12:59.240]  So huge thanks to the people at Elevate.
[12:59.240 --> 13:00.120]  Thank you, ladies.
[13:00.120 --> 13:02.200]  You realize Becca did that.
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.760]  Did you assemble the glass also?
[13:04.760 --> 13:05.240]  No.
[13:05.240 --> 13:05.740]  OK.
[13:06.060 --> 13:09.340]  But she did all the fancy work.
[13:09.340 --> 13:09.900]  Well, thank you.
[13:09.900 --> 13:10.460]  That's perfect.
[13:10.460 --> 13:13.020]  It was Silver Surfer Steve that blew the pipe, correct?
[13:13.020 --> 13:15.180]  Well, shout out to Silver Surfer Steve.
[13:15.180 --> 13:17.180]  Why do I have such a hard time with Silver Surfer?
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.220]  It's just two words.
[13:18.220 --> 13:20.140]  Silver Surfer Steve, thank you for the glass.
[13:20.140 --> 13:21.100]  It's super.
[13:21.100 --> 13:22.940]  I'm super excited to smoke through this.
[13:24.620 --> 13:26.700]  I think we're getting rude, but it was really funny.
[13:26.700 --> 13:31.260]  And super thank you for the perfect, perfect decals.
[13:31.260 --> 13:31.740]  I love it.
[13:31.740 --> 13:32.300]  It's great.
[13:32.300 --> 13:33.580]  I'll post pictures of you guys.
[13:33.580 --> 13:37.340]  Check it out on the IRI Genetics Instagram, IRI underscore genetics.
[13:37.340 --> 13:37.840]  Rust-a-quarian.
[13:37.840 --> 13:39.340]  And what did you say?
[13:39.340 --> 13:40.460]  Rustified.
[13:40.460 --> 13:41.820]  Yeah, it's super rustified.
[13:41.820 --> 13:43.020]  It is quite rustified.
[13:43.020 --> 13:44.540]  It is very growing from your heart.
[13:44.540 --> 13:45.260]  And I truly appreciate it.
[13:45.260 --> 13:46.300]  I've been taking dabs off of it.
[13:46.300 --> 13:48.540]  That's why I'm having a hard time speaking English today.
[13:49.740 --> 13:51.500]  Miss Lydia, let's get back to what we were talking about.
[13:51.500 --> 13:52.860]  Look, I found where we were.
[13:52.860 --> 13:54.300]  What brought you to Colorado, sweetheart?
[13:55.820 --> 13:58.380]  Well, my now fiance at the time, he was just my boyfriend.
[13:58.940 --> 14:00.620]  But he moved here.
[14:00.620 --> 14:01.580]  And yeah.
[14:02.220 --> 14:02.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:02.860 --> 14:04.860]  We got engaged in December.
[14:04.860 --> 14:06.140]  So it's been.
[14:06.140 --> 14:06.540]  Thanks.
[14:06.540 --> 14:07.260]  When's that going to happen?
[14:08.060 --> 14:08.860]  We don't really know.
[14:08.860 --> 14:10.140]  We're not really on a rush.
[14:10.140 --> 14:10.700]  We don't really care.
[14:10.700 --> 14:11.180]  You guys are young.
[14:11.180 --> 14:11.340]  Have fun.
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.460]  It's good now.
[14:12.460 --> 14:14.060]  We're going to throw a giant party.
[14:14.060 --> 14:14.540]  Hell yeah.
[14:14.540 --> 14:15.420]  That's all I was asking about.
[14:15.420 --> 14:16.060]  We're going to throw a giant party.
[14:16.060 --> 14:17.500]  That's really what we want.
[14:17.500 --> 14:20.380]  We're not really in it for like the big to do and all that kind of stuff.
[14:20.380 --> 14:21.340]  We just want to.
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.060]  We, I don't know.
[14:22.060 --> 14:25.900]  We might just do it one day randomly and then be like, hey, by the way, this happened.
[14:25.900 --> 14:29.100]  Let's hang out and take like dabs about it.
[14:29.100 --> 14:30.060]  Take dabs about it.
[14:30.060 --> 14:30.560]  Yeah.
[14:30.800 --> 14:31.600]  Take dabs about it.
[14:32.320 --> 14:33.040]  Do you want to dab?
[14:33.040 --> 14:33.360]  I do.
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.000]  Do you want to dab?
[14:34.000 --> 14:34.480]  I do.
[14:34.480 --> 14:34.960]  High five.
[14:34.960 --> 14:35.520]  We're married.
[14:35.520 --> 14:36.240]  It's perfect.
[14:36.960 --> 14:37.760]  It's a great union.
[14:37.760 --> 14:39.200]  No, honestly, he's a really great guy.
[14:39.200 --> 14:40.320]  Becca's kicking off her shoes.
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.920]  We're getting cozy here in Elevate tonight.
[14:41.920 --> 14:42.320]  This is awesome.
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.400]  You're literally the only one with shoes on at this point.
[14:44.400 --> 14:44.960]  I'm just going to fall.
[14:44.960 --> 14:45.120]  What?
[14:45.120 --> 14:46.000]  No, these are.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.280]  Yeah, I don't know how this is going to happen.
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.560]  Those look like new shoes.
[14:48.560 --> 14:49.200]  These are pretty new.
[14:49.200 --> 14:50.160]  They're kind of snug.
[14:50.160 --> 14:51.120]  Oh no, that's really great.
[14:51.120 --> 14:52.560]  Getting them off right on for the encouragement.
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.760]  Here, one more.
[14:53.760 --> 14:54.480]  Heck yeah.
[14:54.480 --> 14:56.960]  Now it's like a, it's Elevate company slumber party.
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.160]  Time machine on one of the TVs back here.
[15:04.160 --> 15:06.320]  And you got a glass blowing video on the TV over here.
[15:06.320 --> 15:06.720]  I just know.
[15:06.720 --> 15:08.240]  How did I not notice that before?
[15:08.240 --> 15:10.000]  Hey, they're making whatever.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  That's the making of my piece basically right there.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.200]  That is pretty rad.
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.400]  I have to look away because I could just stare into that all day.
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.160]  Yeah, and just keep watching and there won't be a podcast.
[15:18.160 --> 15:20.480]  Just be a narrative of me watching this guy blow glass.
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.200]  Granny, that dab of the orange stuff you gave me really got me super high.
[15:25.200 --> 15:25.680]  Thank you.
[15:25.680 --> 15:27.280]  I think Incredible Extracts is.
[15:27.280 --> 15:29.040]  Shout out to Incredible Extracts.
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.000]  I met Derek, the extract artist at.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.760]  Oh, it's a secret sesh.
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.600]  Yeah, he's tall like you.
[15:36.960 --> 15:38.160]  He's tall like you.
[15:38.160 --> 15:39.600]  He is very tall.
[15:39.600 --> 15:40.240]  He is.
[15:40.240 --> 15:42.000]  What's the height difference between you two?
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.520]  Because I mean, you're both pretty tall.
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.440]  I am 6'5".
[15:45.440 --> 15:47.920]  I like to say 5'17 to confuse people.
[15:47.920 --> 15:48.720]  So he's about.
[15:48.720 --> 15:50.160]  Wow, you would be that kind of person.
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.240]  You would, like I'm not, I'm literally not surprised at all.
[15:54.240 --> 15:54.960]  I would walk away.
[15:55.680 --> 15:57.120]  Yeah, that's too much math.
[15:57.120 --> 15:58.800]  I'm not, I'm not signing up for that, dude.
[15:59.280 --> 15:59.920]  You're tall.
[15:59.920 --> 16:00.640]  That's it.
[16:00.640 --> 16:01.520]  5'17.
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.000]  I'm up here.
[16:03.280 --> 16:04.480]  Granny, how tall are you?
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.440]  5'10, 5'11, right in between.
[16:07.440 --> 16:08.160]  Man.
[16:08.160 --> 16:08.960]  5'2.
[16:08.960 --> 16:09.280]  Yeah.
[16:09.280 --> 16:09.920]  5'2 over there.
[16:09.920 --> 16:11.040]  We the 5'2 gang.
[16:11.040 --> 16:11.760]  5'2 gang.
[16:11.760 --> 16:12.560]  All right.
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.600]  5'7.
[16:13.600 --> 16:14.800]  I'm going to go 5'7.
[16:14.800 --> 16:15.600]  Ha ha, she wins.
[16:16.320 --> 16:16.720]  Wow.
[16:16.720 --> 16:17.040]  OK.
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.680]  I don't know why.
[16:17.680 --> 16:18.080]  I don't know.
[16:18.080 --> 16:19.520]  I was like, I was like, what is it?
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.000]  What is she?
[16:20.000 --> 16:20.720]  What are we comparing?
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.080]  Becca always wins.
[16:22.080 --> 16:22.240]  I don't know.
[16:22.240 --> 16:22.880]  She does.
[16:22.880 --> 16:25.600]  That's why she is Queen Becula.
[16:26.400 --> 16:30.800]  Man, I thought I was going to say something about her great breasts.
[16:30.800 --> 16:32.240]  I'm still, I'm avoiding her great.
[16:32.240 --> 16:34.400]  I can't say anything about if I say it, it's creepy.
[16:34.400 --> 16:35.360]  If you say it, it's cute.
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.320]  I just have to.
[16:36.320 --> 16:37.520]  About your great breasts.
[16:37.520 --> 16:39.440]  I'll just make eye contact and behave myself.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.840]  Man, this is funny.
[16:44.400 --> 16:46.960]  You're going to hold the microphone next because it's my turn to take a dab.
[16:46.960 --> 16:49.520]  Oh, so tell us you came here with your fiance.
[16:50.080 --> 16:51.040]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.960]  Did you have a purpose when you headed out here or just new life?
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.840]  Um, well, actually, I got my degree in business management in Pennsylvania
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.360]  and I had my cosmetology license so I could move out here and do that if I wanted to.
[17:03.360 --> 17:07.680]  But low key, I worked in a head shop in the town that I lived in
[17:07.680 --> 17:09.440]  and it wasn't super progressive at all.
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.240]  Like the dude didn't want to carry like wax stuff, but he was a hippie.
[17:14.240 --> 17:18.880]  He was like a legitimate, like from the beginning, my old boss in Pennsylvania.
[17:18.880 --> 17:20.480]  I was going to say not Adam.
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.400]  No, no, no, not my fiance.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.680]  You're absolutely correct in that.
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.360]  But yeah, anyways, it was it's what I really I loved.
[17:29.360 --> 17:31.280]  It's what I was always a part of.
[17:31.280 --> 17:39.360]  So yeah, when I came out here, I met Queen Rebecula and my life has been this ever since.
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.320]  You guys make a great team.
[17:40.320 --> 17:40.960]  This is perfect.
[17:40.960 --> 17:44.320]  I like the way that you've set up the store and then the dolls and the way that the dolls
[17:44.320 --> 17:45.760]  rep the store perfectly.
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.520]  The way you guys do all the social media stuff.
[17:47.520 --> 17:48.000]  You're perfect.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.280]  I couldn't do without them.
[17:49.280 --> 17:49.840]  You're perfect.
[17:49.840 --> 17:51.120]  I got the best team.
[17:51.120 --> 17:54.640]  But, you know, we got to mention that there's also higher elevations.
[17:54.640 --> 17:55.840]  That's part of this family.
[17:55.840 --> 17:56.340]  Yes.
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.680]  You know, before I came here, before I met Lydia, I did get a rig repaired at higher
[18:03.680 --> 18:05.840]  elevation masterpiece productions.
[18:05.840 --> 18:08.640]  I googled who can fix my glass on the Internet.
[18:08.640 --> 18:10.000]  And that's the first place that came up.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.880]  And I drove there and they told me I needed to make a deposit and drop off the rig.
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.160]  And if they fix my rig, they would charge me the other half of my payment.
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.640]  And if they didn't, they would give me a nice deal on a new purchase from the store.
[18:22.640 --> 18:24.240]  And I felt that that was super fair.
[18:24.240 --> 18:27.520]  And they called me in about 10 days and they said, hey, bro, come get your rig.
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.840]  And the rig is straighter now than it was when I got it from the original artist.
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.840]  We do tend to make glass look better.
[18:33.840 --> 18:34.320]  Yeah.
[18:34.320 --> 18:35.040]  Then that came in.
[18:35.760 --> 18:39.520]  I don't like it when my dab nail points up at an angle because you're putting hash on
[18:39.520 --> 18:39.760]  there.
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.360]  It needs to stay straight because I put a lot of oil on a nail and the amount of oil I put
[18:43.360 --> 18:45.120]  on there, if it's tilted at all, it will run off.
[18:45.120 --> 18:46.240]  So I need it straight up and down.
[18:46.240 --> 18:48.320]  And that rig was a little crooked before I broke it.
[18:48.320 --> 18:49.840]  And now it's perfectly straight up and down.
[18:49.840 --> 18:51.360]  My oil stays on there perfectly.
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.800]  So it was a good thing you broke it.
[18:52.800 --> 18:54.400]  Plus, you found higher elevation.
[18:54.400 --> 18:54.800]  I did.
[18:54.800 --> 18:55.680]  It changed my life.
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.400]  So it was perfect.
[18:56.400 --> 18:58.240]  We wouldn't be sitting here right now if that didn't happen.
[18:58.240 --> 18:59.920]  So I guess that was a good thing.
[18:59.920 --> 19:00.480]  Yes.
[19:00.480 --> 19:01.040]  All right.
[19:01.040 --> 19:04.560]  Let's segue over to the event that Granny wanted to talk about.
[19:04.560 --> 19:06.960]  That'll be a perfect time since Lydia's over here taking a dab.
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.520]  October 1st.
[19:09.520 --> 19:11.040]  That's a Saturday coming up.
[19:11.040 --> 19:12.080]  October 1st.
[19:12.080 --> 19:14.960]  This is really a great event.
[19:15.920 --> 19:18.240]  Actually, Elevate is going to be part of this as well.
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.520]  But I'm going to kind of read off the flyer because I'm pretty impressed with this event.
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.320]  It's with DBK Glass.
[19:29.120 --> 19:34.880]  And right now, they have 32 Colorado blowers that are going to be blowing glass that day.
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.800]  Then they're going to auction off those pipes.
[19:39.680 --> 19:46.640]  And all that money, all the proceeds are going to go to the Institute for Research on Cannabinoids.
[19:47.600 --> 19:48.960]  Did I get the accent on the right?
[19:48.960 --> 19:50.160]  You said it perfectly.
[19:50.160 --> 19:50.480]  Okay.
[19:51.840 --> 19:55.280]  And there's going to be a chili cook-off as well.
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.360]  So there's going to be people making chili.
[19:57.360 --> 19:58.960]  Some of it's going to be medicated.
[19:58.960 --> 20:01.040]  Some of it's going to be just regular chili.
[20:01.680 --> 20:05.040]  It's going to be from 9.30 to...
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.600]  I thought I saw a time.
[20:07.840 --> 20:12.400]  7 p.m. is when they're going to start judging the glass blowers.
[20:12.400 --> 20:17.680]  So each glass blower is going to be given an allotted amount of time to make a piece.
[20:18.640 --> 20:21.360]  And I'm telling you, there's like glass blowers.
[20:21.360 --> 20:25.360]  32 glass blowers that are all allowed a certain amount of time to make a piece.
[20:25.360 --> 20:30.560]  And then at the end, they're going to raffle that and give that money to cannabinoid research.
[20:31.200 --> 20:32.400]  There is going to be...
[20:32.400 --> 20:33.200]  That is awesome.
[20:33.200 --> 20:35.840]  I'm telling you, the glass blowers, it's amazing.
[20:36.000 --> 20:43.760]  It's Dr. Dabbs, Zombre Glass, Wazoo Glass, Higher Elevated, Borro Mojo,
[20:44.880 --> 20:48.000]  Rebels Glass, Slow Glass, the Glass Parrot.
[20:49.680 --> 20:52.640]  Our very own Silver Surfer Steve is going to be there.
[20:52.640 --> 20:53.760]  Dave the Slave.
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.120]  I think Matt's blowing.
[20:58.320 --> 21:00.720]  Pop D, Blazing Trees.
[21:00.720 --> 21:02.480]  Is our friend Chosen One going to be in there?
[21:02.480 --> 21:03.840]  Yes, he's going to be there.
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.800]  Shout out Chosen One.
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.560]  Pop D is going to be there.
[21:06.560 --> 21:09.840]  Josh Kabbler, Brown.
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.240]  I think Brent Thackeray is going to be there.
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.560]  There's going to be so many local glass blowers.
[21:14.560 --> 21:15.760]  And that's October 1st?
[21:15.760 --> 21:16.400]  Yep.
[21:16.400 --> 21:17.440]  What's the location?
[21:17.440 --> 21:19.680]  SSV Steve's birthday that day.
[21:19.680 --> 21:22.400]  Silver Surfer Steve's birthday party also.
[21:22.400 --> 21:24.240]  Let's invade it and make it his birthday party, you guys.
[21:24.240 --> 21:24.800]  Party up.
[21:24.800 --> 21:25.360]  Bring them a dab.
[21:25.360 --> 21:26.000]  They don't know yet.
[21:26.000 --> 21:26.800]  Oh, they don't know yet?
[21:26.800 --> 21:27.360]  Well, they do now.
[21:27.360 --> 21:28.560]  They're going to know Monday.
[21:28.560 --> 21:29.360]  They do now.
[21:30.080 --> 21:31.120]  So hey, everybody.
[21:31.120 --> 21:32.720]  Where is the location, Dabbing Granny?
[21:32.720 --> 21:34.880]  The location is down.
[21:34.880 --> 21:36.320]  It's on El Paso.
[21:36.320 --> 21:36.880]  Yep.
[21:36.880 --> 21:40.160]  2833 North El Paso.
[21:41.600 --> 21:43.360]  Chef Brother Luck is going to be there.
[21:43.360 --> 21:45.040]  And that's in Colorado Springs, right?
[21:45.040 --> 21:45.360]  Yep.
[21:45.360 --> 21:45.860]  OK.
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.000]  Where is it at?
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.520]  Can you give them kind of directions?
[21:50.080 --> 21:50.400]  Yeah.
[21:50.400 --> 21:57.920]  So if you go Nevada to Fillmore, you're going to go right on Fillmore.
[21:57.920 --> 22:00.720]  And then El Paso is going to be on your left-hand side.
[22:00.720 --> 22:01.760]  Oh, they come and go.
[22:01.760 --> 22:02.320]  Yes.
[22:02.400 --> 22:03.120]  Yep.
[22:03.120 --> 22:03.440]  Yeah.
[22:03.440 --> 22:04.480]  Kind of by the Jimmy Johns.
[22:05.520 --> 22:06.080]  DBK.
[22:08.320 --> 22:09.120]  Awesome.
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.880]  You know, it's going to be out in the parking lot.
[22:10.880 --> 22:11.520]  I'm just thrilled.
[22:11.520 --> 22:12.480]  You guys will see it.
[22:12.480 --> 22:13.040]  You will find it.
[22:13.040 --> 22:15.120]  If you drive to the right direction, you will find it.
[22:15.120 --> 22:15.600]  There's a good chance I'll be there.
[22:15.600 --> 22:18.240]  And the Great Southern Food Truck is going to be there.
[22:18.240 --> 22:20.240]  So there's going to be food as well.
[22:20.240 --> 22:22.160]  I think it's just going to be a great event.
[22:22.160 --> 22:26.240]  You know, I would say it's kind of like a cannabis family event because...
[22:26.240 --> 22:27.040]  It's going to be really fun.
[22:27.040 --> 22:28.960]  Live glassblowing is always fun to watch.
[22:29.600 --> 22:31.280]  Glassblowing is amazing.
[22:31.280 --> 22:31.600]  Isn't it?
[22:31.600 --> 22:34.240]  If you've never seen anybody make glass, it's an amazing thing to see.
[22:34.240 --> 22:39.040]  They take a rod of solid glass and they turn it into something you can smoke through.
[22:39.040 --> 22:43.280]  In this room I'm sitting in, I can't even describe this properly.
[22:43.280 --> 22:47.600]  There are probably a hundred different styles of glass just within my view
[22:47.600 --> 22:51.200]  that I can tell a hundred different artists just twisted these up their way.
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.560]  Everybody's going to do it their way.
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.720]  It's amazing that everything in front of me started off as just a rod of clear glass.
[22:56.720 --> 22:59.200]  Then we have another event we want to talk about.
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.160]  Oh, shit.
[23:00.160 --> 23:00.720]  Uh-oh.
[23:00.720 --> 23:01.200]  Uh-oh.
[23:01.600 --> 23:02.960]  ZDuck is sitting up.
[23:03.680 --> 23:08.080]  I think October 22nd, there's something going on here in the spring.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.280]  I heard about something.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.480]  It's probably going to be the bee's knees.
[23:12.480 --> 23:13.600]  The bee's knees.
[23:14.320 --> 23:15.200]  Do they still say that?
[23:15.840 --> 23:16.560]  They do now.
[23:16.560 --> 23:17.680]  All right, we're bringing that back.
[23:17.680 --> 23:18.480]  We're bringing it back.
[23:18.480 --> 23:19.040]  Bringing it back.
[23:19.040 --> 23:20.720]  We're bringing back the bee's knees.
[23:20.720 --> 23:21.520]  The bee's knees.
[23:21.520 --> 23:23.840]  And we're going to party till the cows come home.
[23:25.920 --> 23:27.280]  She is a corn lady.
[23:27.840 --> 23:29.280]  All right, October 22nd.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  Yes, October 22nd at the Black Sheep, we're going to be having a heady Halloween party.
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.120]  We're going to have a costume contest.
[23:39.120 --> 23:41.360]  We're going to have pumpkin carving contest.
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.280]  We're going to have a dab buzz.
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.280]  We're going to have dabbing fucking granny.
[23:46.080 --> 23:46.580]  Can I say it?
[23:47.680 --> 23:49.440]  You can say whatever the fuck you want on the show.
[23:49.440 --> 23:51.280]  You can say whatever the fuck you want.
[23:51.280 --> 23:53.040]  This is an adult show.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.280]  We're going to have live glass blowing.
[23:55.280 --> 23:57.760]  We're going to have tons of decorations.
[23:57.760 --> 24:05.360]  We're going to have a photo booth, live music from Snow Lab, Groove On, the E.T.'s.
[24:06.080 --> 24:08.960]  About eight or nine locals are going to play.
[24:09.760 --> 24:11.680]  We're going to have a photo booth with props.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.400]  We're going to be playing scary movies.
[24:14.400 --> 24:15.360]  Tickets are only $10.
[24:16.320 --> 24:18.400]  Now, Becca, where do they get those tickets?
[24:18.400 --> 24:24.160]  They can get the tickets at Elevate Glass Gallery, which is downtown on Tejon and Cimarron.
[24:24.160 --> 24:30.160]  Higher Elevations, which is Powers and Omaha, or at the Black Sheep itself.
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.040]  Nothing online?
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.360]  No, you can get it off the Black Sheep's website, I do believe.
[24:35.360 --> 24:36.160]  I bet you can.
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.000]  Yes, you can get anything off the Black Sheep.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.240]  So guys, I will most likely be at the event October 22nd.
[24:42.240 --> 24:43.040]  Most likely.
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.480]  Well, they gave me a ticket and they're staring at me like you better be there or I'm going to
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.440]  burn you with the dab torch.
[24:47.440 --> 24:47.920]  So guess what?
[24:47.920 --> 24:49.120]  Ross and Jeff will be there.
[24:49.120 --> 24:49.280]  Yay!
[24:49.280 --> 24:50.400]  We'll take dabs.
[24:50.400 --> 24:52.720]  I can't tell you what my costume will be because I may be in a costume.
[24:52.720 --> 24:53.600]  It'll be a good ass time.
[24:54.160 --> 24:55.440]  You're going to be incognito.
[24:55.440 --> 24:57.040]  How will we know it's you, Ross and Jeff?
[24:57.040 --> 25:01.600]  We're going to be giving away over $2,000 worth of stuff for these prizes, guys.
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.160]  Glass?
[25:02.800 --> 25:03.520]  Glass, yes.
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.080]  Come dressed to impress.
[25:12.070 --> 25:13.670]  We're going to start a new dab band.
[25:14.230 --> 25:15.750]  That's the name of our band, just dab.
[25:16.390 --> 25:16.890]  Dab.
[25:17.350 --> 25:18.790]  October 22nd, guys, at the Black Sheep.
[25:18.790 --> 25:19.430]  Come check it out.
[25:19.430 --> 25:20.310]  Take dabs with us.
[25:21.670 --> 25:22.870]  Lots of glass prizes.
[25:23.350 --> 25:25.830]  Bring an extra backpack or something because you're going to win some glass.
[25:25.830 --> 25:26.950]  You're going to need to take home a piece.
[25:27.430 --> 25:28.390]  What kind of glass?
[25:29.430 --> 25:34.470]  SSV Steve is going to make a Halloween themed piece for the grand prize.
[25:35.110 --> 25:37.750]  I'm trying to talk him into making a pumpkin perk.
[25:39.030 --> 25:39.530]  Definitely.
[25:40.150 --> 25:41.110]  Hashtag pumpkin perk.
[25:41.110 --> 25:41.750]  Yes, very UV.
[25:41.750 --> 25:43.270]  UV is very spooky.
[25:43.270 --> 25:43.590]  Yes.
[25:44.630 --> 25:46.150]  And he's good at UV.
[25:46.150 --> 25:46.390]  Yeah.
[25:47.430 --> 25:49.270]  So yeah, lots and lots of prizes.
[25:49.270 --> 25:50.710]  Probably some vaporizers.
[25:50.710 --> 25:53.350]  A lot of our listeners aren't in the dab scene.
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.470]  They're not from Colorado.
[25:54.470 --> 25:57.430]  They may be from Oklahoma or Australia or wherever.
[25:57.430 --> 25:59.670]  It's like you're driving to Colorado for Halloween.
[26:00.390 --> 26:04.870]  Well, I wanted to teach them about UV glass really quickly because UV is kind of the new shit.
[26:04.870 --> 26:07.750]  It's one of the newest things that's popping up on the glass scene right now.
[26:07.750 --> 26:08.630]  Illuminati.
[26:09.430 --> 26:14.550]  Granny's passing the mic over to Lydia because I think Lydia may be our UV expert.
[26:14.550 --> 26:15.830]  It might be what's happening here.
[26:15.830 --> 26:16.150]  Oh, no.
[26:16.150 --> 26:16.710]  Is that you?
[26:16.710 --> 26:17.190]  Is that you?
[26:17.190 --> 26:18.710]  You want to teach us about UV?
[26:18.710 --> 26:20.150]  She's totally the UV expert.
[26:20.150 --> 26:21.430]  I was hoping you were going to teach me about UV.
[26:21.430 --> 26:22.390]  I'm totally not the UV expert.
[26:22.390 --> 26:24.710]  So UV, they put, I don't know what they put in the glass.
[26:24.710 --> 26:26.550]  It's radioactive salt that they put in the glass.
[26:26.550 --> 26:27.750]  Okay, Becca knows.
[26:27.750 --> 26:29.590]  They put radioactive salt in the glass.
[26:29.590 --> 26:30.390]  Becca knows everything.
[26:30.390 --> 26:32.150]  And then they make a glass pipe with it.
[26:32.150 --> 26:35.590]  And then you turn on your black light and your glass glows.
[26:35.590 --> 26:36.710]  And it is crazy looking.
[26:36.710 --> 26:38.150]  It looks radioactive, you guys.
[26:38.150 --> 26:40.630]  It only glows under UV light, though.
[26:40.630 --> 26:43.430]  It will not glow in the dark.
[26:43.430 --> 26:44.470]  Only UV.
[26:44.470 --> 26:45.990]  Okay, that makes enough sense to me.
[26:45.990 --> 26:47.270]  I do have something to add, though.
[26:47.270 --> 26:47.910]  Let's hear it.
[26:47.910 --> 26:49.510]  Okay, so my...
[26:50.390 --> 26:52.550]  No, okay, no, that's not what I'm adding.
[26:52.550 --> 26:59.110]  My true obsession of UV is because I grew up in the 90s.
[26:59.110 --> 27:05.030]  And I did those damn fuzzy posters that glow under black light.
[27:05.030 --> 27:10.310]  And I had several black light accessories in my fucking awesome bedroom
[27:10.310 --> 27:11.990]  when I grew up on a cul-de-sac.
[27:11.990 --> 27:13.750]  Did it look like Spencers threw up in your bedroom?
[27:14.310 --> 27:17.270]  No, I wasn't that like kind of douchey.
[27:17.350 --> 27:19.190]  Like I did, I had like four lava lamps.
[27:19.190 --> 27:21.830]  And I'm really would like to start acquiring them.
[27:21.830 --> 27:22.950]  I have a lava lamp, you know.
[27:23.590 --> 27:24.470]  That's really awesome.
[27:24.470 --> 27:25.830]  You do have a dabbing lava lamp.
[27:26.390 --> 27:27.430]  Granny's, oh, you've got the dab.
[27:27.430 --> 27:29.030]  I've hit your dab lava lamp, Granny.
[27:29.030 --> 27:29.510]  Yes, I have.
[27:29.510 --> 27:30.230]  That is cute.
[27:30.230 --> 27:33.110]  Yeah, so that's why I like the UV glass.
[27:33.110 --> 27:37.830]  Because it's like an ode to the 90s like time that I grew up in.
[27:37.830 --> 27:38.950]  Because it's just like black light.
[27:38.950 --> 27:39.430]  And it's dope.
[27:39.430 --> 27:40.310]  And I'm smoking from it.
[27:40.310 --> 27:41.270]  It's getting really stoned.
[27:41.270 --> 27:45.350]  So it's like putting together a bunch of parts of, you know, the good stuff.
[27:45.350 --> 27:45.910]  It's awesome.
[27:45.910 --> 27:47.190]  It's a nostalgia.
[27:47.270 --> 27:48.150]  Yeah, right.
[27:48.150 --> 27:49.750]  I know I'm still like a child.
[27:49.750 --> 27:51.270]  I was just about to say, how old are you?
[27:51.270 --> 27:52.790]  I'm like nostalgia.
[27:52.790 --> 27:55.510]  Well, you know, I'm an old soul, Jeff.
[27:55.510 --> 27:56.630]  Okay, I'm 22.
[27:56.630 --> 27:58.630]  But so cannabis is brought.
[27:58.630 --> 28:02.310]  There's somebody from just about every generation in this room right now because of cannabis.
[28:02.950 --> 28:05.270]  22 years old.
[28:05.270 --> 28:06.790]  But look at how smart she is.
[28:06.790 --> 28:07.590]  On the right track.
[28:08.390 --> 28:11.350]  I'm telling you, these young people just amaze me.
[28:11.350 --> 28:11.750]  Don't they?
[28:11.750 --> 28:12.710]  You, Jeff?
[28:12.710 --> 28:14.790]  I mean, you're not as old as me, but.
[28:15.670 --> 28:17.590]  Shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola.
[28:17.590 --> 28:19.750]  Shout out to Barefoot Grower.
[28:19.750 --> 28:21.110]  Those guys are 10 years younger than me.
[28:21.110 --> 28:23.750]  And when I look at their gross shit, shout out to the Garden of Weeden.
[28:23.750 --> 28:25.030]  Those guys are 10 years younger than me.
[28:25.030 --> 28:28.470]  When I look at their stuff, I'm like, holy shit, those guys are killing it.
[28:28.470 --> 28:33.110]  And then they work with these young extraction artists up in the canyon up there and the
[28:33.110 --> 28:34.630]  medicine they make.
[28:34.630 --> 28:34.790]  Yes.
[28:34.790 --> 28:38.550]  You know, like I say, this Incredibles is good stuff.
[28:38.550 --> 28:41.910]  You buy that medicine from the homies.
[28:42.950 --> 28:44.550]  That is really good medicine.
[28:44.790 --> 28:46.870]  The Incredibles is made by somebody younger than me.
[28:47.590 --> 28:48.070]  Really?
[28:48.070 --> 28:49.270]  Yeah, that guy's younger than me.
[28:49.270 --> 28:50.070]  Diaz.
[28:50.070 --> 28:52.310]  I'm certain that Diaz is a few years younger than me.
[28:52.310 --> 28:56.790]  Well, they're very proud of their grow because any product you and I both know comes from
[28:56.790 --> 28:59.750]  the grow and they have a good product.
[28:59.750 --> 29:02.230]  That orange soda is tasty.
[29:02.230 --> 29:04.630]  The frozen monkey, any of their rosin.
[29:04.630 --> 29:05.670]  The frozen monkey?
[29:05.670 --> 29:06.790]  I think it's funky monkey.
[29:07.350 --> 29:08.790]  No, it's fresh frozen monkey.
[29:08.790 --> 29:11.190]  OK, that that makes more sense to me than.
[29:11.190 --> 29:13.030]  And then we've got the sour band.
[29:13.030 --> 29:16.550]  Do you want to talk a little bit about fresh frozen and the difference between the frozen
[29:16.550 --> 29:20.150]  and the not frozen since Becca had a couple of questions about it and these ladies had
[29:20.150 --> 29:20.790]  questions earlier?
[29:20.790 --> 29:26.470]  Well, you being the big expert, I love to dab, but I'm getting to know the difference
[29:26.470 --> 29:28.390]  in the products I like.
[29:28.390 --> 29:34.550]  And it really seems like this fresh frozen keeps the turps in, as we've talked about
[29:34.550 --> 29:34.950]  before.
[29:34.950 --> 29:37.190]  We don't have any of our turp men here tonight.
[29:37.190 --> 29:40.950]  The main difference is we're cutting down the plants while they're while they're still
[29:40.950 --> 29:41.190]  alive.
[29:41.190 --> 29:44.870]  We cut them down, trim them up just a little bit, take off the big leaves, throw those
[29:44.870 --> 29:46.950]  in a freezer and freeze them up completely.
[29:48.230 --> 29:50.550]  I'm going to tell the whole world what you just did.
[29:50.550 --> 29:54.230]  All right, so we freeze the plants completely and then we put the frozen material into the
[29:54.230 --> 29:56.710]  extraction tubes and extract it with the butane.
[29:56.710 --> 29:57.990]  Then it goes into the back of it.
[29:57.990 --> 29:59.190]  Then it's properly purged.
[29:59.910 --> 30:03.430]  That's the main difference is that before we were letting the herb dry, panging the
[30:03.430 --> 30:04.230]  plants to dry.
[30:04.230 --> 30:07.110]  And I think that the frozen we are certainly getting more turps.
[30:07.110 --> 30:08.630]  And that's what we're calling live resin.
[30:08.630 --> 30:11.190]  We're getting way more turps, way more flavor.
[30:11.190 --> 30:15.110]  It's definitely a more of a more presentable product.
[30:15.110 --> 30:18.790]  It's probably the top of the concentrates right now.
[30:18.790 --> 30:20.230]  That the distillate and the turps.
[30:20.950 --> 30:21.990]  Distillates and turps.
[30:21.990 --> 30:24.070]  It kind of depends on where you are and what you're looking for.
[30:24.070 --> 30:26.070]  But yeah, the live resin, the distillate and the turps.
[30:26.070 --> 30:29.750]  I'm a shatter guy myself because I like to take giant dabs of shatter.
[30:29.750 --> 30:30.390]  Me too.
[30:30.390 --> 30:30.870]  Me too.
[30:30.870 --> 30:32.230]  I've seen you take some pretty big globs.
[30:32.230 --> 30:34.230]  You get this sappy stuff, you need a shovel.
[30:35.110 --> 30:37.830]  You need one of those skillet shovel tools.
[30:37.830 --> 30:39.110]  Like a honey wand almost.
[30:39.110 --> 30:39.430]  Yeah.
[30:39.430 --> 30:40.550]  It's so sappy and gooey.
[30:40.550 --> 30:41.830]  Usually that's the CBD stuff.
[30:41.830 --> 30:43.590]  The CBD makes it really, really runny.
[30:43.590 --> 30:45.590]  All that orange soda is pretty sappy.
[30:45.590 --> 30:47.670]  That stuff tastes so good.
[30:47.670 --> 30:48.310]  Yes.
[30:48.310 --> 30:48.950]  So good.
[30:49.830 --> 30:50.710]  You can smell it.
[30:50.710 --> 30:51.670]  How many times have you dabbed?
[30:51.670 --> 30:53.590]  I hear you only dab like occasionally.
[30:53.590 --> 30:54.950]  Oh, she got mics for every direction.
[30:54.950 --> 30:56.790]  Oh, mics for days.
[30:57.670 --> 30:59.190]  Got mic bridge titties.
[31:01.430 --> 31:02.710]  She's in stereo, you guys.
[31:02.710 --> 31:04.310]  She's got a mic in each hand.
[31:04.310 --> 31:05.750]  Becca's on some dabs right now.
[31:05.750 --> 31:06.390]  She's double fist.
[31:06.470 --> 31:07.910]  She's definitely catching a buzz from us.
[31:07.910 --> 31:09.110]  She's double fisted.
[31:09.110 --> 31:10.550]  It's where I'm hitting with part of this.
[31:10.550 --> 31:13.350]  I've dabbed once in my entire life.
[31:13.350 --> 31:15.990]  And that was out of a 12 foot dab straw
[31:16.710 --> 31:20.470]  with dabbing granny at one of my parties.
[31:20.470 --> 31:22.230]  That was your only dab ever?
[31:22.230 --> 31:23.110]  Pretty much, yeah.
[31:23.110 --> 31:26.470]  Granny, did you know that that was her first dab ever?
[31:27.190 --> 31:28.070]  I did not.
[31:28.950 --> 31:31.030]  And because Becca is my friend,
[31:31.910 --> 31:35.750]  I thought I should turn her on to some good medicine
[31:35.750 --> 31:37.110]  like the orange soda.
[31:37.110 --> 31:38.150]  Oh, man.
[31:38.150 --> 31:40.150]  Probably about a third of a gram.
[31:41.110 --> 31:42.390]  That's like a my size dab.
[31:43.430 --> 31:44.630]  Yeah, I was pretty fucked up.
[31:44.630 --> 31:45.430]  Did you take a nap?
[31:46.470 --> 31:50.630]  I went and hid for like two hours.
[31:52.470 --> 31:53.590]  Incognito.
[31:53.590 --> 31:55.110]  And then I came back out
[31:55.110 --> 31:58.390]  and I was super fucking high for the next 48 hours.
[31:58.390 --> 31:58.890]  Wow.
[31:59.750 --> 32:02.950]  And we did like three shots of Patron
[32:02.950 --> 32:05.030]  and we drank some beer.
[32:06.230 --> 32:06.790]  Yeah.
[32:06.790 --> 32:08.070]  It's good to be the boss, right?
[32:08.070 --> 32:08.570]  Yes.
[32:09.030 --> 32:09.530]  Damn.
[32:10.070 --> 32:11.590]  Well, I'm pretty sure you caught a nice little buzz
[32:11.590 --> 32:12.550]  hanging out with us tonight.
[32:12.550 --> 32:14.230]  That's why I was hitting with all that.
[32:14.230 --> 32:15.270]  Granny's always a good time.
[32:15.270 --> 32:16.710]  I've never had a bad time with granny.
[32:16.710 --> 32:18.870]  Even the podcast that didn't work was a good time.
[32:19.670 --> 32:20.170]  Yes.
[32:20.950 --> 32:21.670]  We love granny.
[32:21.670 --> 32:23.030]  Miss Dabigale over there.
[32:23.030 --> 32:23.350]  Yes.
[32:23.350 --> 32:24.550]  What's your favorite stuff to dab?
[32:26.150 --> 32:29.030]  I do like some live resin or some sugar.
[32:29.030 --> 32:29.830]  Some sugar.
[32:29.830 --> 32:30.230]  Yes.
[32:30.230 --> 32:31.990]  So we got to explain that now.
[32:32.790 --> 32:34.710]  Some live resin will sugar up sometimes.
[32:35.430 --> 32:36.150]  It looks grainy.
[32:36.150 --> 32:38.150]  It looks real like sugar granules,
[32:38.150 --> 32:40.230]  like golden honey sugar granules.
[32:40.950 --> 32:43.670]  I find that to have a lot of flavor most of the time.
[32:43.670 --> 32:44.170]  Yeah.
[32:44.470 --> 32:46.310]  I'm not really sure how it's made exactly,
[32:46.310 --> 32:48.390]  but I do appreciate it a lot.
[32:48.390 --> 32:50.230]  Do you like big dabs or little dabs?
[32:50.230 --> 32:51.430]  I like big dabs.
[32:51.430 --> 32:51.930]  How big?
[32:52.550 --> 32:53.050]  Oh.
[32:53.110 --> 32:54.390]  Like 0.3, 0.2?
[32:55.030 --> 32:57.350]  Yeah, like 0.3, 0.4.
[32:57.350 --> 32:57.850]  0.4.
[33:00.710 --> 33:01.670]  Half gram dabs.
[33:01.670 --> 33:02.230]  Do it.
[33:02.230 --> 33:03.270]  Let's get a half gram dab.
[33:03.350 --> 33:04.550]  Go for a dabs draw.
[33:04.550 --> 33:05.110]  Let's do it.
[33:05.750 --> 33:06.550]  For your birthday.
[33:07.270 --> 33:07.770]  Yes.
[33:07.830 --> 33:08.230]  Uh-oh.
[33:08.230 --> 33:09.350]  Is it your birthday?
[33:09.350 --> 33:10.870]  My birthday is on Friday.
[33:10.870 --> 33:11.670]  On Friday.
[33:12.470 --> 33:15.110]  We're going to have to come do lots of dabs for Dabigale's birthday.
[33:15.110 --> 33:17.430]  Everybody wish her happy birthday on Twitter and Instagram.
[33:17.430 --> 33:19.510]  She already shouted out her stuff earlier at the start of the show,
[33:19.510 --> 33:21.430]  so make sure you tell this young lady happy birthday.
[33:21.430 --> 33:22.630]  This podcast won't come out till Monday,
[33:22.630 --> 33:25.910]  but you can retroactively wish her a late birthday.
[33:26.470 --> 33:26.870]  Thanks.
[33:26.870 --> 33:27.110]  All right.
[33:27.110 --> 33:28.230]  Let's get some dabs going then.
[33:28.230 --> 33:29.910]  You want to do a half gram dab?
[33:29.910 --> 33:31.590]  I got my hands full, but I'm going to make it happen.
[33:32.310 --> 33:32.870]  I got the throw.
[33:33.110 --> 33:33.590]  Miss, Miss.
[33:35.190 --> 33:36.630]  That wasn't as bad as it sounded, you guys.
[33:36.630 --> 33:37.830]  That all came through on the microphones.
[33:37.830 --> 33:38.630]  That was just a dabber.
[33:38.630 --> 33:39.110]  It was cool.
[33:39.110 --> 33:39.610]  Nothing.
[33:40.550 --> 33:42.150]  We know a few glass blowers.
[33:42.150 --> 33:42.870]  We do.
[33:42.870 --> 33:44.470]  If things get broken, I know where to take it.
[33:45.510 --> 33:47.350]  I'm going to tell you yesterday what I did.
[33:47.910 --> 33:53.830]  I had the privilege of hanging out with our mutual friend, Ross DeJeff, THC Sam.
[33:54.710 --> 33:56.390]  And we went up to Denver.
[33:56.390 --> 33:57.830]  Sam is a great dude.
[33:57.830 --> 33:59.190]  He is a great dude.
[33:59.190 --> 34:03.110]  And his friend, Josh, who they went to college together.
[34:04.310 --> 34:05.190]  He came with us.
[34:05.190 --> 34:06.550]  But we went to Denver.
[34:07.190 --> 34:11.190]  And I went to a few new dispensaries up there that I'd never been to before.
[34:11.190 --> 34:12.390]  And that was fun.
[34:13.030 --> 34:17.190]  And then I went to THC Magazine, the office.
[34:17.190 --> 34:17.270]  I really feel like I need to narrate this dab for Dabigal.
[34:17.270 --> 34:21.110]  They're moving in right in the heart of downtown Denver.
[34:21.110 --> 34:21.510]  A real nice office.
[34:21.510 --> 34:23.910]  Because, dude, she is going to be wrecked.
[34:23.910 --> 34:26.070]  So Sam and I are going to start something up there.
[34:26.150 --> 34:29.510]  We're going to be doing either a podcast or a broadcast.
[34:30.150 --> 34:31.270]  She said she's excited.
[34:31.270 --> 34:32.710]  She really doesn't know what she's doing.
[34:32.710 --> 34:33.510]  All right, granny.
[34:33.510 --> 34:38.390]  This young lady is about to take a .3, maybe a .4 over there.
[34:38.390 --> 34:38.950]  Holy.
[34:38.950 --> 34:40.870]  Okay, so it's about .4.
[34:40.870 --> 34:43.030]  This is a pre-birthday dab for Miss Dabigal.
[34:43.030 --> 34:45.030]  I'm causing pain to Dabigal already.
[34:45.030 --> 34:45.750]  Oh my gosh.
[34:45.750 --> 34:46.390]  Go ahead, Lydia.
[34:46.390 --> 34:47.350]  I will let you narrate.
[34:47.350 --> 34:47.990]  You're good at this.
[34:48.870 --> 34:51.350]  Well, just because I know Dabigal.
[34:51.350 --> 34:54.070]  So this is pretty intense.
[34:54.070 --> 34:55.030]  Is that a big one for her?
[34:55.030 --> 34:55.990]  Oh my God, it's huge.
[34:55.990 --> 34:57.110]  She's dropping it in the nail.
[34:57.110 --> 34:57.670]  She is.
[34:57.670 --> 34:58.870]  I mean, it's doing good.
[34:58.870 --> 34:59.190]  She's hitting...
[34:59.190 --> 35:02.710]  It's like puddling and it's a lot of delicious low-temp lean.
[35:02.710 --> 35:06.150]  She's hitting the Rasta-themed Elevate Recycler.
[35:06.150 --> 35:06.790]  She's kind of trying not to choke.
[35:06.790 --> 35:09.270]  Nobody make her laugh because, yeah, holy cow.
[35:09.270 --> 35:10.470]  She's got the carb cap on.
[35:10.470 --> 35:11.110]  I think she did it.
[35:11.110 --> 35:11.590]  I'm going to call that a success.
[35:11.590 --> 35:12.470]  She totally did it.
[35:12.470 --> 35:13.910]  Oh, it's without a doubt a success.
[35:14.470 --> 35:15.110]  No cough.
[35:15.110 --> 35:16.070]  She's a pro.
[35:16.070 --> 35:16.550]  Without a...
[35:16.550 --> 35:19.190]  Out of a 10, I give you an 11.
[35:19.190 --> 35:20.630]  Yes, she didn't change any colors.
[35:20.630 --> 35:22.630]  That cough, that amount of coughing is acceptable.
[35:22.630 --> 35:23.910]  Yeah, we totally, for sure.
[35:23.910 --> 35:24.870]  I would be dying.
[35:24.870 --> 35:25.750]  Like, I'm not even going to deny it.
[35:25.750 --> 35:28.710]  There is no way Becca does not have a contact high.
[35:29.750 --> 35:32.230]  I just smelt that dab all the way over here.
[35:32.230 --> 35:36.310]  That was actually the Pineapple Jack Nug Run Shatter from Turpex.
[35:36.310 --> 35:37.270]  Shout out to Turpex.
[35:37.270 --> 35:39.190]  I picked that up over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[35:39.190 --> 35:40.630]  Shout out to my friends at Green and Healthy.
[35:40.630 --> 35:41.270]  What's up, Lindsay?
[35:41.270 --> 35:43.350]  I hope you're having a great shift if you're listening to this at work.
[35:44.070 --> 35:44.870]  Hi, Lindsay.
[35:45.510 --> 35:47.990]  Shout out to Lindsay, the Traveling Stoner.
[35:47.990 --> 35:49.190]  Always a shout out to Lindsay.
[35:49.190 --> 35:51.030]  The podcast is not the same without her.
[35:51.030 --> 35:52.070]  Oh my gosh.
[35:52.070 --> 35:53.670]  She came in here and got rollers.
[35:54.630 --> 35:56.390]  She was one of the most delightful people.
[35:57.430 --> 36:01.510]  We talked about how she hung out with you at the Secrets.
[36:04.230 --> 36:08.390]  But anyways, she is really, really delightful.
[36:09.910 --> 36:11.750]  It was actually a really funny story.
[36:11.750 --> 36:15.430]  I couldn't find the roller that was literally right in front of my face.
[36:16.230 --> 36:18.070]  I wasn't stoned or anything.
[36:18.070 --> 36:18.710]  That's your style.
[36:19.510 --> 36:19.990]  I know.
[36:19.990 --> 36:21.990]  I don't really ask for forgiveness for it.
[36:22.630 --> 36:25.190]  But yeah, the thing is I wasn't even really stoned.
[36:25.990 --> 36:28.630]  I have a max capacity of stoned and I was not at it.
[36:28.630 --> 36:32.310]  And yeah, she was really, really delightful.
[36:32.310 --> 36:33.030]  Really delightful.
[36:33.030 --> 36:34.070]  Lindsay's one of my best friends.
[36:34.790 --> 36:35.750]  You have a good best friend.
[36:35.750 --> 36:36.150]  Yeah.
[36:36.150 --> 36:37.430]  It's one of my favorite people on the planet.
[36:37.430 --> 36:38.070]  Shout out to Lindsay.
[36:38.070 --> 36:39.110]  Shout out to Bobo Blaster.
[36:39.110 --> 36:43.670]  So I want to get back to the ice cream incident that I saw happen over here.
[36:43.670 --> 36:45.030]  What are you guys doing to my microphone?
[36:46.310 --> 36:47.590]  We literally were...
[36:47.590 --> 36:49.590]  Don't disrespect my microphone like that, ladies.
[36:49.590 --> 36:51.270]  I'm going to have to sanitize everything.
[36:51.270 --> 36:52.230]  We totally didn't lick it.
[36:52.230 --> 36:53.590]  I didn't touch it with my tongue.
[36:53.590 --> 36:54.790]  You're making it more valuable, okay?
[36:56.550 --> 36:58.070]  Becca said they made it more valuable.
[36:58.070 --> 37:00.230]  They increased the value of it's christened.
[37:00.230 --> 37:01.670]  Yeah, with our presence.
[37:04.550 --> 37:06.150]  Our close proximity.
[37:06.150 --> 37:08.390]  You are so lucky you didn't go to high school together.
[37:09.190 --> 37:10.950]  Yes, that's very true.
[37:10.950 --> 37:12.630]  We probably are.
[37:12.630 --> 37:13.590]  That would have been troublesome.
[37:13.590 --> 37:16.310]  We were talking about us in high school actually the other day.
[37:16.310 --> 37:17.190]  We very much were.
[37:17.190 --> 37:20.470]  And Lydia, sometimes I tend to have to explain things to her like...
[37:20.630 --> 37:21.270]  Fuck you.
[37:21.270 --> 37:22.390]  Trap house and...
[37:23.110 --> 37:23.910]  What was the other one?
[37:23.910 --> 37:24.410]  Lean?
[37:25.430 --> 37:26.390]  Okay, yeah.
[37:26.390 --> 37:28.470]  And we started talking about house parties.
[37:28.470 --> 37:30.630]  She was like, house party?
[37:31.510 --> 37:34.870]  Well, okay, because somebody used it as a form of measurement.
[37:35.990 --> 37:38.230]  I was like, oh, how many people were there?
[37:38.230 --> 37:40.630]  And she was like, oh, well, it was like a house party.
[37:40.630 --> 37:43.670]  And I was like, I don't know what that means still.
[37:44.550 --> 37:46.310]  Dab again was like, oh, yeah, okay.
[37:46.310 --> 37:48.230]  And I'm like, wait, what?
[37:48.230 --> 37:49.590]  How does that make sense to you?
[37:49.590 --> 37:52.790]  It's one the size of groups smaller than the black sheep.
[37:53.670 --> 37:54.170]  Yeah.
[37:54.550 --> 37:56.230]  See, everybody understood that reference.
[37:56.230 --> 37:57.430]  No, no, no.
[37:57.430 --> 37:59.110]  What if you have a small house?
[37:59.990 --> 38:02.150]  What if you live in one of them damn tiny houses?
[38:02.150 --> 38:03.910]  Well, we're all coming over anyway.
[38:03.910 --> 38:06.230]  That's where it came from.
[38:06.230 --> 38:13.190]  That's where it came because my brother had fit 74 people into like a bottom section of a house.
[38:13.190 --> 38:15.270]  And my mom didn't wake up the whole time.
[38:15.270 --> 38:17.190]  And there were 74 people in the basement.
[38:17.830 --> 38:19.110]  What did they give your mother?
[38:20.550 --> 38:26.950]  She had just gotten her top teeth taken out and got dentures put in.
[38:26.950 --> 38:28.550]  She was done for the night.
[38:28.550 --> 38:30.150]  Four days, she was done.
[38:30.150 --> 38:30.650]  Wow.
[38:31.110 --> 38:31.430]  Yeah.
[38:31.430 --> 38:32.070]  I'll take two.
[38:32.070 --> 38:32.950]  So house parties.
[38:34.470 --> 38:40.150]  Speaking of being out for four days, let's just shout out to Max at TNT Instractions.
[38:40.150 --> 38:41.030]  Did he get you, Granny?
[38:41.910 --> 38:43.990]  Yeah, his bacon.
[38:43.990 --> 38:44.790]  I'm sorry, Jeff.
[38:44.790 --> 38:46.870]  I know you're a vegetarian, so you would know.
[38:47.110 --> 38:49.830]  His bacon is the shit.
[38:50.630 --> 38:52.470]  He gives me bacon every time I see him.
[38:52.470 --> 38:54.150]  And I remind him that I'm a vegetarian.
[38:54.150 --> 38:54.710]  Yeah.
[38:54.710 --> 38:55.990]  Now he gives me dabs.
[38:55.990 --> 38:56.790]  He's like, here, bro.
[38:56.790 --> 38:57.110]  Sorry.
[38:57.110 --> 38:58.870]  Sorry about all the bacon I've given you.
[38:58.870 --> 38:59.910]  He's a nice guy.
[38:59.910 --> 39:03.430]  I just met him a few weeks ago was the first time I met him.
[39:03.430 --> 39:07.430]  He gave me two separate 1000 milligram edibles.
[39:08.070 --> 39:11.670]  And I'm not sure if I wanted to be his friend after I ate the first one.
[39:12.630 --> 39:14.550]  That made my life difficult.
[39:14.550 --> 39:15.030]  Oh, my God.
[39:15.030 --> 39:19.190]  A thousand milligrams is like I described it as putting ankle weights on your brain.
[39:19.190 --> 39:22.470]  It was it was a challenge all day long and the next day as well.
[39:23.030 --> 39:26.710]  It took me three days because I ate six pieces of that bacon.
[39:27.350 --> 39:30.950]  And then two of those cookies from that guy that was standing there.
[39:30.950 --> 39:33.030]  450 milligram cookies.
[39:33.030 --> 39:33.350]  Each?
[39:34.070 --> 39:34.550]  Each.
[39:34.550 --> 39:36.150]  Oh, you were flying, Granny.
[39:36.150 --> 39:36.630]  Yeah.
[39:36.630 --> 39:37.590]  You were sedated.
[39:38.150 --> 39:40.470]  I took my husband to the military doctor.
[39:40.470 --> 39:42.150]  He is like, what's wrong with you, Gail?
[39:42.150 --> 39:43.590]  Why are you so sluggish?
[39:44.230 --> 39:46.950]  I know I'm so tired and I really didn't know.
[39:47.830 --> 39:52.230]  And then by the end of the week, I was like, I know what was wrong with me.
[39:53.670 --> 39:54.790]  I ate way too many.
[39:54.790 --> 39:57.670]  I have to tell you a funny story about the military hospital.
[39:58.870 --> 39:59.510]  We were there.
[40:01.830 --> 40:02.330]  Monday.
[40:03.830 --> 40:08.550]  And we were walking to the elevator and a little soldier in uniform,
[40:08.550 --> 40:15.430]  he must have been about 25, came running up to me and said, I know you.
[40:17.270 --> 40:18.470]  And I said, oh, you do?
[40:18.470 --> 40:20.470]  And he said, yeah, let's get in the elevator, though.
[40:20.470 --> 40:24.630]  So as soon as we got in the elevator, he said, can I have my picture with you now?
[40:24.630 --> 40:25.350]  That is cool.
[40:25.350 --> 40:25.830]  Yes.
[40:25.830 --> 40:27.510]  You know, we haven't taken a selfie, Granny.
[40:27.510 --> 40:29.030]  We're going to have to do that before we leave here.
[40:29.030 --> 40:30.230]  Yeah, we're definitely going to have to.
[40:30.230 --> 40:32.070]  I noticed that we've hung out like three or four times now.
[40:32.070 --> 40:33.030]  There's no selfie of us.
[40:33.030 --> 40:34.870]  That's because we always enjoy each other's company.
[40:34.870 --> 40:35.430]  That's the truth.
[40:35.430 --> 40:36.950]  We don't think about getting the phones out.
[40:36.950 --> 40:38.470]  Put our phones away and have a good time.
[40:38.470 --> 40:41.350]  If you take a selfie with Rasta Jeff, is that called a Jeffy?
[40:41.350 --> 40:42.550]  That's what I've always wondered.
[40:42.550 --> 40:43.670]  I think yes.
[40:43.670 --> 40:46.710]  If you take a selfie on a rooftop, is that called a roofie?
[40:46.710 --> 40:47.210]  Yes.
[40:48.870 --> 40:50.790]  That's not my joke, but it's funny either way.
[40:51.510 --> 40:52.310]  What happened to Lydia?
[40:52.310 --> 40:53.030]  Where did she go?
[40:53.030 --> 40:53.910]  To the bathroom.
[40:53.910 --> 40:55.270]  Come on, Lydia, you couldn't wait.
[40:55.270 --> 40:57.190]  You don't have podcaster bladder.
[40:57.190 --> 40:58.230]  Podcaster bladder.
[40:58.230 --> 40:59.190]  No, it's a special thing.
[40:59.190 --> 40:59.590]  She don't.
[40:59.590 --> 41:00.310]  It's a pod.
[41:00.310 --> 41:01.430]  It's like truck driver bladder.
[41:01.990 --> 41:03.670]  This is her first podcast.
[41:03.670 --> 41:04.870]  Well, you guys are wonderful on the podcast.
[41:04.870 --> 41:05.370]  How about you?
[41:05.910 --> 41:06.410]  Yeah, same.
[41:07.510 --> 41:08.870]  It's fun, isn't it?
[41:08.870 --> 41:10.550]  Well, I hope you guys are back on another podcast.
[41:11.190 --> 41:12.950]  We hope to be on another podcast.
[41:12.950 --> 41:17.430]  If my equipment learns to behave itself, maybe I can record a little bit from the event on
[41:17.430 --> 41:19.430]  October 22nd at the Black Sheep.
[41:19.430 --> 41:20.950]  Yes, that'd be awesome.
[41:20.950 --> 41:22.550]  All right, I'll try to bring this little recorder.
[41:22.550 --> 41:26.230]  I'll get it fixed because everybody that listens to the show knows that this thing gave us some
[41:26.230 --> 41:27.190]  issues and I don't trust it.
[41:28.230 --> 41:29.190]  I'll get it fixed.
[41:29.190 --> 41:30.550]  We'll bring it to the one on the 22nd.
[41:30.550 --> 41:31.910]  I'll bring one or two microphones.
[41:31.910 --> 41:34.070]  We'll talk about the event live from the place while we're there.
[41:34.230 --> 41:34.790]  Are you cold?
[41:34.790 --> 41:35.510]  I'm freezing.
[41:35.510 --> 41:36.070]  You're freezing.
[41:36.070 --> 41:38.070]  You can have my sweatshirt.
[41:39.110 --> 41:45.840]  I had to turn the air on to get the cloud of dabs moving around.
[41:45.840 --> 41:49.920]  I was trying to think of a tactful way to say that without busting you out on having
[41:49.920 --> 41:52.720]  the front of the store nice and cloudy.
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.160]  I think it is you and me.
[41:54.160 --> 41:55.360]  Shout out to the pizza guy.
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.200]  The last time we hung out together, they had to open the back door.
[41:59.200 --> 42:00.880]  You know, something happens when we get together, granny.
[42:00.880 --> 42:01.440]  We seem to...
[42:01.440 --> 42:03.840]  They opened the back door so the smoke alarms and the...
[42:04.640 --> 42:05.840]  Place didn't get shut down.
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.600]  Let's talk about the recent change in the rules at the cannabis clubs here in Colorado
[42:13.600 --> 42:13.840]  Springs.
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.120]  How do you feel about that, granny?
[42:16.000 --> 42:16.560]  You know what?
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.400]  This podcast is going to air before September 21st.
[42:23.520 --> 42:30.000]  September 21st, I want a show of force at the courthouse here in Colorado Springs.
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.520]  They're shutting down our cannabis clubs again.
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.520]  Now, I want you to come out.
[42:36.080 --> 42:37.360]  We're not going to speak.
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.240]  We're just going to show that we support them.
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.240]  And I want you to come acting like adults.
[42:44.240 --> 42:45.440]  I don't want no silliness.
[42:45.440 --> 42:51.040]  So if you can't come like professional people in the cannabis community, please stay home.
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.560]  But let's show these clubs that, no, we support you and we're not going to let the city shut
[42:56.560 --> 42:57.120]  you down.
[42:57.200 --> 42:58.240]  I'm upset.
[42:58.240 --> 42:59.200]  It's frustrating.
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.680]  Because you know the next step, they're going to shut them down.
[43:01.680 --> 43:04.800]  Then they're going to come after our grows, us, our caregiver grows.
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.320]  They're already doing that here in Springs.
[43:06.320 --> 43:09.440]  They've limited how many plants you can have and they've shut it down to a number of plants
[43:09.440 --> 43:13.040]  where several of my friends who are veterans and patients are unable to grow the medicine
[43:13.040 --> 43:14.720]  that they need for themselves.
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.960]  And so their option was to go possibly to these clubs and now they can't even go to
[43:18.960 --> 43:19.440]  these clubs.
[43:19.440 --> 43:20.000]  The clubs are no...
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.160]  So you guys, what we're talking about is the clubs, you are no longer allowed to go
[43:24.160 --> 43:24.960]  to these clubs.
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.400]  You are no longer allowed to consume cannabis in these cannabis social clubs.
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.680]  You are no longer allowed to reimburse them for product that they may provide for you.
[43:35.680 --> 43:39.040]  They're trying to do away with all of the social consumption clubs.
[43:39.040 --> 43:40.160]  And I don't think it's right.
[43:40.160 --> 43:41.920]  I think that we need these places.
[43:41.920 --> 43:44.800]  I think that without these places, we have to go smoke in our cars.
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.080]  We have to go smoke in the park.
[43:46.080 --> 43:47.440]  We have to go smoke in the alley.
[43:47.440 --> 43:51.760]  We have to go park in front of somebody weird's house and take a couple of dabs in our car
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.720]  and drive on to another weird house, park in front of there and take a couple of dabs
[43:54.720 --> 43:57.840]  because it's hard as shit to drive and dab in the city when you're on a lunch break.
[43:57.840 --> 44:00.960]  Or do you think some of these guys are going to go back to hanging out in the bars?
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.440]  Well, yeah, that's what a lot of people do, unfortunately.
[44:05.440 --> 44:09.920]  And I myself, if I didn't have cannabis, I would probably drink alcohol and I am no good
[44:09.920 --> 44:10.560]  at alcohol.
[44:10.560 --> 44:13.360]  I don't know if I'm no good at it or if I'm really, really good at it.
[44:13.920 --> 44:15.760]  I don't think anybody is good at it.
[44:15.760 --> 44:22.240]  And when we were leaving that event in Denver a few weeks ago, and we drove through the
[44:22.240 --> 44:24.560]  bar by the bars in downtown Denver.
[44:24.640 --> 44:25.140]  Yeah.
[44:25.760 --> 44:28.880]  First thing we saw was a drunken female.
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.680]  Her boyfriend pushed her.
[44:31.680 --> 44:32.720]  She was so drunk.
[44:32.720 --> 44:34.800]  She fell into the intersection.
[44:34.800 --> 44:38.160]  There was four or five other drunk shouting obscenities.
[44:38.160 --> 44:40.720]  And I just thought, I hate alcohol.
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.120]  Yeah.
[44:41.120 --> 44:44.800]  I was at an event with people with cannabis that left.
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.400]  They all left smiling and hugging and everybody was happy.
[44:48.400 --> 44:51.040]  High fiving each other, feeling good, not going to be hung over tomorrow.
[44:51.040 --> 44:52.480]  I'm not going to drive into stuff.
[44:52.480 --> 44:53.680]  So why can't we have our-
[44:53.680 --> 44:54.480]  And cancer free.
[44:54.560 --> 44:57.120]  Why can't we have our places to congregate?
[44:57.120 --> 44:57.600]  I agree.
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.160]  And the other thing we need to push for Jeff is, you know, they're coming after our medical.
[45:03.520 --> 45:03.680]  Yeah.
[45:03.680 --> 45:04.960]  Why are they trying to get rid of medical?
[45:04.960 --> 45:05.520]  That's not fair.
[45:05.520 --> 45:06.720]  That's what started the whole thing.
[45:06.720 --> 45:08.800]  We need medical marijuana for the patients.
[45:08.800 --> 45:09.520]  Yes, we do.
[45:10.080 --> 45:11.600]  Because let's think about it.
[45:11.600 --> 45:13.680]  We all want legalized cannabis.
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.160]  All of us do, but we're kind of being fooled.
[45:16.160 --> 45:17.120]  Watch the right hand.
[45:17.120 --> 45:19.040]  Don't pay attention to the left hand.
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.600]  We're going to give you legalized, but we're going to make it wreck.
[45:21.600 --> 45:21.920]  Okay.
[45:21.920 --> 45:25.760]  So what if you're truly a patient that truly, truly needs medical?
[45:25.760 --> 45:29.120]  More than likely you are on a fixed income.
[45:30.080 --> 45:33.200]  You have a hard time affording your medicine to begin with.
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.240]  And so now we're going to add a 47% tax or more.
[45:37.440 --> 45:38.400]  Is that right?
[45:38.400 --> 45:40.000]  No, it's not right at all.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.600]  And that's not what our system here in Colorado was designed for at all.
[45:43.600 --> 45:45.040]  And it's not just Colorado.
[45:45.040 --> 45:45.920]  I see it happening.
[45:45.920 --> 45:47.920]  First, it happened in Washington state.
[45:48.480 --> 45:50.560]  Now it's moving next door to Oregon.
[45:50.560 --> 45:52.560]  It's going to happen here in Colorado.
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.440]  Do you think eventually we will have a nationwide cannabis program that is run by one
[45:57.440 --> 46:01.920]  governing organization that takes care of all the marijuana, the alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and firearms?
[46:01.920 --> 46:07.040]  I think that's what our governing bodies want.
[46:07.040 --> 46:09.440]  Look how much money can be made.
[46:09.440 --> 46:10.560]  Tons of money.
[46:10.560 --> 46:12.080]  But that doesn't mean it's right.
[46:12.080 --> 46:13.120]  I don't, you know what?
[46:13.920 --> 46:17.280]  I see the cannabis community going the way of the family farm.
[46:18.400 --> 46:19.680]  It's going to go away.
[46:19.680 --> 46:21.280]  And then what are you going to have to choose from?
[46:21.280 --> 46:23.840]  Look here, Jeff, we sit here, we have all this great medicine.
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.240]  If it becomes what the government is leading us to, you'll have a strain of Indica maybe,
[46:30.240 --> 46:31.440]  and a strain of Sativa.
[46:31.440 --> 46:33.120]  It'll be a Monsanto, Rand product.
[46:33.120 --> 46:34.960]  And it will be icky.
[46:34.960 --> 46:36.080]  Walmart packaged, very regulated.
[46:36.080 --> 46:37.840]  It won't be your genetics.
[46:37.840 --> 46:40.160]  Oh no, no, it'll be some GMO stuff.
[46:40.160 --> 46:43.600]  You will continue growing, but then we're back to breaking the law, aren't we?
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.100]  Right.
[46:44.880 --> 46:48.480]  So all I can say is we keep pushing for what we've been pushing for.
[46:48.480 --> 46:51.680]  Keep the medical in your, if you have medical where you are, don't get rid of it.
[46:51.680 --> 46:53.680]  Keep it medicals where it all started.
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.200]  And like I always say in almost every episode, when we talk about social clubs,
[46:57.200 --> 47:00.480]  if you are writing legislation in your area for cannabis use,
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.120]  make sure you include somewhere to consume that cannabis.
[47:03.120 --> 47:05.840]  Make sure you include social lounges or social clubs,
[47:05.840 --> 47:08.560]  somewhere that you can purchase and consume cannabis with your friends,
[47:08.560 --> 47:11.520]  like responsible adults, because that's very much needed
[47:11.520 --> 47:14.880]  when you do legalize cannabis in a new area.
[47:14.880 --> 47:16.560]  Learn from us here in Colorado.
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.360]  We've always been, everybody's had eyes on Colorado as far as the cannabis goes.
[47:22.880 --> 47:25.440]  We are learning this was something they slipped through
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.240]  and we just didn't pay any attention.
[47:28.240 --> 47:33.040]  So we thought, okay, we've got our clubs while we were walking kind of in a gray area.
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.560]  And now the city is not liking us any longer, for lack of a better word, I guess.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.440]  They want tax money.
[47:40.000 --> 47:40.320]  Yes.
[47:40.320 --> 47:41.680]  It's all about tax money.
[47:41.680 --> 47:43.920]  All right, we've been going for 49 minutes
[47:43.920 --> 47:46.720]  and most people usually give up about one hour into a podcast.
[47:46.720 --> 47:50.560]  So we should start saying goodbye to all of the lovely people that have listened to the show.
[47:50.560 --> 47:52.800]  I'm going to ask one more question as we go around the circle.
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.360]  Granny, you'll be first, so hang on to your microphone here.
[47:55.360 --> 47:57.440]  One simple question, Indica or Sativa?
[47:57.440 --> 47:58.160]  Indica.
[47:58.160 --> 47:59.280]  All right, nice and easy.
[47:59.280 --> 48:00.240]  Becca, do you even care?
[48:00.880 --> 48:01.520]  Sativa.
[48:01.520 --> 48:02.160]  Sativa.
[48:02.160 --> 48:03.920]  Okay, did you just pick one randomly or just...
[48:04.800 --> 48:05.760]  No, when I smoke, I...
[48:07.040 --> 48:07.360]  Okay.
[48:07.360 --> 48:08.800]  And when I do smoke, I choose Sativa.
[48:08.800 --> 48:09.680]  Okay, all right.
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.280]  You smoke flower, don't you, Becca?
[48:11.280 --> 48:12.720]  Oh, she smokes flowers too.
[48:12.720 --> 48:14.560]  Okay, I didn't even see, I didn't even think of flowers.
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.120]  I forgot all about the flowers.
[48:15.120 --> 48:16.080]  Shame on you.
[48:16.080 --> 48:17.120]  No, shame on me.
[48:17.840 --> 48:20.640]  Miss Dabigail, Indica or Sativa, honey?
[48:20.640 --> 48:22.720]  I like both, but I prefer Sativa.
[48:22.720 --> 48:23.920]  Okay, that's fair enough.
[48:24.560 --> 48:26.640]  You don't have to act like you're choosing sides or anything.
[48:26.640 --> 48:27.680]  We're not going to go to war.
[48:27.680 --> 48:28.400]  I'm just curious.
[48:28.400 --> 48:29.120]  Yeah, but I mean, yeah, Sativa.
[48:29.120 --> 48:31.360]  You feel like you just, you're like, oh, sorry, Indica.
[48:31.360 --> 48:32.560]  Sorry, sorry.
[48:32.560 --> 48:34.480]  No, no, no, no apologies.
[48:34.480 --> 48:34.800]  All right.
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.760]  Miss Lydia, Indica or Sativa?
[48:38.480 --> 48:39.520]  Indica, for sure.
[48:39.520 --> 48:40.720]  Indica, for sure.
[48:40.720 --> 48:41.440]  For sure.
[48:41.440 --> 48:42.240]  All right, all right.
[48:42.720 --> 48:44.720]  I want to thank all of you guys for coming on the podcast.
[48:44.720 --> 48:47.280]  I want to thank you for letting me come and hang out in the front of your store
[48:47.280 --> 48:48.960]  and take dabs and eat pizza.
[48:48.960 --> 48:50.320]  Shout out to the pizza guy once again.
[48:50.320 --> 48:51.120]  That was super cool.
[48:51.920 --> 48:53.200]  Customer service like a champ.
[48:53.760 --> 48:54.320]  Yes.
[48:54.320 --> 48:55.440]  Ladies, thank you for joining me.
[48:55.440 --> 48:56.720]  Granny, thanks for putting this together.
[48:56.720 --> 48:58.080]  This was all your idea.
[48:58.080 --> 48:59.440]  I'm glad it happened.
[48:59.440 --> 49:00.240]  I really am.
[49:00.240 --> 49:01.920]  Granny, thank you.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.800]  Granny messaged me and she said, hey, I'm going to bring Rebecca and we're going to
[49:04.800 --> 49:07.520]  go to your house and do a podcast at your studio.
[49:07.520 --> 49:08.960]  And I was like, that sounds like a good idea.
[49:08.960 --> 49:10.400]  And I was like, let me know how it goes.
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.800]  And she said, well, she closes the store at eight and then she's free.
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.040]  And I thought, wait, she closes the store at eight and all the buttons in my head started
[49:17.040 --> 49:17.360]  pushing.
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.600]  And I said, why don't I go to Elevate where the dabbing or the Elevate dolls are?
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.960]  I want to call you the dabbing dolls.
[49:22.960 --> 49:24.000]  Are you dabbing dolls?
[49:24.000 --> 49:24.960]  We totally do that.
[49:24.960 --> 49:25.360]  All right.
[49:25.360 --> 49:25.680]  Yes.
[49:25.680 --> 49:26.160]  We'll take it.
[49:26.160 --> 49:27.360]  Where the Elevate dolls are.
[49:27.360 --> 49:28.960]  And this worked out very well.
[49:28.960 --> 49:30.480]  I was given a sweet gift.
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.280]  I was fed pizza and I got to hang out with some lovely ladies.
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.920]  And Elevate is spelled E-L-E-V-8.
[49:35.920 --> 49:36.160]  Yes.
[49:36.160 --> 49:36.880]  Check it out, you guys.
[49:36.880 --> 49:39.360]  It's 517 South Dayhoney, Colorado Springs.
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.040]  I'm sure there's an Instagram page.
[49:41.040 --> 49:41.920]  Which one he runs that?
[49:42.480 --> 49:43.040]  All of us.
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.400]  Oh, you see all.
[49:44.400 --> 49:44.880]  Yeah.
[49:44.880 --> 49:46.400]  All of the people who work at the store.
[49:46.400 --> 49:48.160]  And you have a website as well, don't you?
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.120]  Elevateglassgallery.com.
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.280]  And also make sure you check out Higher Elevations Masterpiece Productions, their sister store.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.360]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[49:57.360 --> 49:59.120]  There's so much glass in that store.
[49:59.120 --> 49:59.440]  Yeah.
[49:59.440 --> 49:59.680]  Yeah.
[49:59.680 --> 50:00.800]  Going on nine years.
[50:00.800 --> 50:01.680]  Nine years over there.
[50:01.680 --> 50:03.360]  Their birthday is October 1st also.
[50:04.400 --> 50:04.640]  Yeah.
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.240]  You guys make sure you come to the event.
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.560]  Granny, remind us the date of your event that you were talking about.
[50:08.560 --> 50:11.840]  October 1st down on El Paso.
[50:11.840 --> 50:12.960]  At DBK.
[50:12.960 --> 50:14.240]  DBK Glass.
[50:14.240 --> 50:17.760]  There's going to be like 30 plus local glass blowers.
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.920]  And Lazadank Ass Chili.
[50:19.920 --> 50:21.600]  And don't forget.
[50:21.600 --> 50:22.320]  Sounds scary.
[50:22.320 --> 50:27.440]  We're going to surprise them, but it is SSV Steve's birthday.
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.400]  Happy birthday, Steve.
[50:28.400 --> 50:30.080]  Happy birthday, Steve.
[50:30.080 --> 50:31.040]  He's a good guy.
[50:31.040 --> 50:35.840]  He's behind the scenes a lot, but he's a good guy in the cannabis community.
[50:35.840 --> 50:38.720]  And then October 22nd at the Black Sheep.
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.000]  A heady Halloween.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.040]  Heady Halloween.
[50:41.040 --> 50:42.240]  Come in costume.
[50:42.240 --> 50:42.880]  Yes.
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.200]  Dress the best to impress and win.
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.120]  Party with the elevators and all our glass blowers.
[50:49.120 --> 50:51.040]  And it's going to be so much fun.
[50:51.040 --> 50:51.920]  Dabbing Granny.
[50:51.920 --> 50:52.560]  Dabbing Granny will be there.
[50:52.560 --> 50:53.440]  Yes, I'm going to be there.
[50:53.440 --> 50:54.640]  And Rasta Jeff will be there.
[50:54.640 --> 50:57.200]  I'll have my recording gear with me part of the time.
[50:57.200 --> 50:59.280]  I hear there will be a dab bus.
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.120]  That's the word.
[51:01.120 --> 51:02.320]  What is that?
[51:02.320 --> 51:03.200]  And hula hoops.
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.440]  So it's going to be cold and the Black Sheep won't allow us to consume inside.
[51:08.000 --> 51:16.720]  So we're going to have a bus parked in the front so that we can dab safely and be warm and cozy.
[51:16.720 --> 51:18.320]  Because the bus is private property.
[51:18.320 --> 51:18.880]  Yes.
[51:18.880 --> 51:22.080]  And is not involved with the Black Sheep or their liquor license.
[51:22.080 --> 51:24.560]  So the separation and the unity work perfectly.
[51:24.560 --> 51:25.120]  I like that.
[51:25.680 --> 51:26.800]  Happy Colorado.
[51:26.800 --> 51:27.300]  Yay.
[51:27.840 --> 51:28.320]  Yep.
[51:28.320 --> 51:31.920]  I hope to see all of you that are listening to the show at the Black Sheep
[51:31.920 --> 51:33.840]  at the birthday party on October 22nd.
[51:33.840 --> 51:34.720]  I'll be in costume.
[51:34.720 --> 51:36.320]  I think it'll be really hot in there.
[51:36.320 --> 51:38.400]  I'll take off my mask and he'll go, there he is.
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.440]  It'll be really fun.
[51:39.440 --> 51:41.600]  I look forward to taking a dab with you on the dab bus.
[51:41.600 --> 51:43.200]  Maybe we can put somebody on the podcast.
[51:43.200 --> 51:44.080]  You can tell us what you think.
[51:44.640 --> 51:45.680]  Look forward to seeing you.
[51:45.680 --> 51:46.880]  Ladies, thanks again for joining me.
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.240]  Thanks for having us.
[51:49.520 --> 51:51.120]  You guys need to start like a vocal group.
[51:51.120 --> 51:51.840]  That was rad.
[51:52.720 --> 51:54.160]  Uh-oh, someone's at the door.
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.000]  There's a little chihuahua at the door.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.320]  I think that's a good way to wrap up the podcast.
[51:58.320 --> 51:59.440]  That dog's saying, shut up in there.
[51:59.440 --> 52:00.320]  You guys are too loud.
[52:00.320 --> 52:01.200]  We have pizza.

[55:41.260 --> 55:46.480]  Cause lyrically no doubt that sells of luggage is.
[55:46.480 --> 55:49.120]  But flip phone, my car, sell my messages.

[55:51.840 --> 55:54.320]  Marijuana, cigar, smells and policies.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.880]  A few kind must prefer for the charities.
[55:56.880 --> 55:59.520]  Cause politicians are all up on their promises.
[55:59.520 --> 56:02.080]  A new face will fulfill the prophecies.
[56:02.080 --> 56:04.960]  It's too late for two-faced apologies.
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.880]  They be sitting in and it was just a long day.
[56:39.880 --> 56:42.280]  Only sitting in and when you can come home.
[56:42.280 --> 57:01.680]  Well, what a bit of the water villages.
[57:01.680 --> 57:04.240]  My metaphors and folding with my symbolism.
[57:04.240 --> 57:05.040]  One can go.
