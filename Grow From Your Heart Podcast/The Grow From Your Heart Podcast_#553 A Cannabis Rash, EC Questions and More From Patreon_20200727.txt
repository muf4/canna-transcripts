[00:00.060 --> 00:14.710]  Here we go.
[00:14.710 --> 00:16.110]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:16.110 --> 00:21.230]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 553 of the Grow
[00:21.230 --> 00:23.550]  from Your Heart podcast.

[00:59.390 --> 01:05.510]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:05.510 --> 01:11.110]  Today I've been taking dabs of Orangatane Funk Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:11.110 --> 01:15.550]  This is a blend of Jelly 13 and Grease Monkey on the package.
[01:15.550 --> 01:19.550]  The flavor is described as orange rinds and buttery fuel.
[01:19.550 --> 01:25.790]  When I open up this concentrate, the first thing I smell is a funky orange rind punch
[01:25.790 --> 01:26.790]  to the face.
[01:26.790 --> 01:27.790]  It is kind of gross.
[01:27.790 --> 01:29.790]  It's kind of delicious all at the same time.
[01:29.790 --> 01:35.470]  Then it is followed by a gassy, I want to say kind of armpits and sweat sort of aroma
[01:35.470 --> 01:38.430]  that I honestly really enjoy.
[01:38.430 --> 01:42.710]  That orangey, gassy, funky thing really gets my attention.
[01:42.710 --> 01:47.150]  So much so that I smoked this entire gram of concentrates in just a couple of hours
[01:47.150 --> 01:48.150]  today.
[01:48.150 --> 01:49.150]  I bought this this evening.
[01:49.150 --> 01:50.470]  It is gone at recording time.
[01:50.470 --> 01:54.070]  I just took the last dab as I sat down to record.
[01:54.070 --> 01:55.070]  Delicious.
[01:55.070 --> 02:02.270]  On the back of the package it says it contains 65.61% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:02.270 --> 02:06.710]  This was delicious concentrate, amazingly turpy and amazingly potent.
[02:06.710 --> 02:12.470]  So big shout out again to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the perfect podcast concentrate.
[02:12.470 --> 02:17.150]  All right, in this episode I'm going to focus on Patreon messages.
[02:17.150 --> 02:21.670]  Before we get there, let's do a shout out to the members of the 710 Club.
[02:21.670 --> 02:28.190]  The 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher.
[02:28.190 --> 02:32.150]  So let's start off with a big shout out to our friend Melvin818.
[02:32.150 --> 02:34.590]  Let's follow that up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.

[03:56.170 --> 04:00.250]  Let me know you contributed to Patreon. I will move your message right up to the top
[04:00.250 --> 04:06.210]  of the list. This one comes from a Patreon contributor who is known as North, North Terps.
[04:06.210 --> 04:10.930]  What up North? Good to hear from you again. It says, yo, what up dude? What up bro? I
[04:10.930 --> 04:14.850]  hope you're well. It says love you bro. Love you too bro. It says I came to Pueblo and
[04:14.850 --> 04:21.250]  it was sweet. Was nice at the Cannabis Connection. I ate a fire ass burger place in town, but
[04:21.250 --> 04:26.010]  hey, I came home after one week. Okay, so he continues. He says I came to Pueblo. It
[04:26.010 --> 04:31.050]  was sweet. I'm glad you had a good time in my town bro. You went to the Colorado Cannabis
[04:31.050 --> 04:34.970]  Exchange. I think he said Connection. It's a Colorado Cannabis Exchange is where I think
[04:34.970 --> 04:38.730]  he went because they told me you came by bro. Thanks for visiting and giving me a shout
[04:38.730 --> 04:43.690]  out. They love knowing that I bring traffic to them. So they mentioned you came by there.
[04:43.690 --> 04:47.090]  I'm glad they took good care of you. That is where I grabbed the Orangatane Funk live
[04:47.090 --> 04:51.190]  batter. So Colorado Cannabis Exchange at the south end of Pueblo will always take good
[04:51.190 --> 04:55.250]  care of you. Tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you and then be polite. If you say I sent
[04:55.490 --> 05:00.930]  you, you better be polite. Then after that, our friend went to a, he says a fire ass burger
[05:00.930 --> 05:05.850]  place in town. I'm pretty sure I know which burger place that is. They offer a delicious
[05:05.850 --> 05:09.850]  vegan burger. They've got a lot of other great options there. Some of their French fries
[05:09.850 --> 05:13.810]  and their dipping sauces are fucking tremendous. I'm glad you found that spot right in the
[05:13.810 --> 05:18.530]  middle of downtown. Really glad you enjoyed that. Good place to eat. This is not the eat
[05:18.530 --> 05:21.870]  from your heart podcast. I just, I'm glad our friend had a good experience in our town
[05:21.870 --> 05:25.550]  and ate at a place where I eat. I hope you got the tater tots too, bro. So much good
[05:25.550 --> 05:30.590]  shit there. Let's continue. It says, anyway, I came home after one week switching into
[05:30.590 --> 05:34.630]  flower. I went out and did some trimming and lollipopping and then all of the sudden I
[05:34.630 --> 05:40.710]  got rashes and hives all over my arms and wherever I was getting touched by the plants.
[05:40.710 --> 05:44.850]  So our friend went and did some work in his garden and now he is experiencing rashes and
[05:44.850 --> 05:49.630]  hives on his arms and his body. After working with the plants, he wants to know maybe it's
[05:49.630 --> 05:54.430]  from something else I did or did my plants all of the sudden decide to make themselves
[05:54.430 --> 05:59.790]  allergic to me because they weren't doing that before? That is a very good question.
[05:59.790 --> 06:04.910]  Unfortunately, this is all too common. I have seen this several times working in the cannabis
[06:04.910 --> 06:10.950]  industry. I've seen this a lot. I have a friend who works with a specific strain. She is a
[06:10.950 --> 06:15.790]  cultivator and a trimmer and a harvester. Shout out Jules if you're listening. Miss
[06:15.790 --> 06:21.310]  you boo. She is a cultivator. She's a badass grower also. When she works with Blue Dream,
[06:21.310 --> 06:25.190]  she will break out in hives. She'll start wheezing and fucking breathing funny. She
[06:25.190 --> 06:29.550]  is allergic to Blue Dream. Just ironically, I know back in the day I used to talk trash
[06:29.550 --> 06:34.590]  about Blue Dream, then she broke out in hives from it. So that extra supported our statement.
[06:34.590 --> 06:39.390]  But I've got a friend who is allergic to Blue Dream and other haze type strains. I've seen
[06:39.390 --> 06:44.390]  other people break out from orange dominant turps. If a plant really smells orangey, they'll
[06:44.390 --> 06:48.390]  get little blisters and rashes up and down their arms. I've seen certain strains give
[06:48.390 --> 06:53.470]  people like asthmatic attacks. Before I thought people were faking it sometimes. They didn't
[06:53.470 --> 06:57.170]  want to trim. They didn't want to work. But then they would come and trim a bunch of strains
[06:57.170 --> 07:01.350]  and then we'd give that strain back to them and it would just hit them. So there are a
[07:01.350 --> 07:07.110]  couple of options that could be happening. My very first concern is a pesticide. Have
[07:07.110 --> 07:11.350]  you applied a pesticide to these plants that you were working with? Maybe you applied a
[07:11.350 --> 07:16.770]  pesticide yesterday, maybe several days ago, maybe a while back. Maybe that pesticide is
[07:16.770 --> 07:21.030]  still on the plants and today something in that pesticide rubbed up against your arms.
[07:21.030 --> 07:25.670]  You got just the right combination of pesticide and heat. The body heat will activate a pesticide
[07:25.670 --> 07:29.550]  and help you get a rash a little more quickly. Maybe that's what happened. Maybe you've hit
[07:29.550 --> 07:32.910]  a pesticide. I don't know what you're putting on your garden. I'm not accusing. I'm listing
[07:32.910 --> 07:37.450]  options trying to make you aware of anything that could have occurred. A pesticide is my
[07:37.450 --> 07:41.230]  first concern because now you're being you're getting poisoned with a pesticide. You need
[07:41.230 --> 07:45.870]  to treat that properly. The next option, did you spray a foliar feed? Did you give
[07:45.870 --> 07:49.790]  it some kind of food that you applied via a foliar feed? I don't know if the plants
[07:49.790 --> 07:53.330]  are indoor or outdoor. I don't know what they're getting sprayed with. Maybe a pesticide or
[07:53.330 --> 07:57.930]  a foliar feed is on the leaves on the plants and it's gotten to your skin and now it is
[07:57.930 --> 08:03.270]  bothering you and giving you a rash. My next question is, is it a new strain? Have you
[08:03.270 --> 08:07.150]  ever grown this strain before? Some strains fuck with some people. Like I mentioned, my
[08:07.150 --> 08:10.970]  friend Jules can't grow Blue Dream. There are other people that other grows. They can't
[08:10.970 --> 08:15.790]  grow citrusy, orangey flavored turps. Those are the ones that I see do the most damage.
[08:15.790 --> 08:21.090]  Hazes, Blue Dream, and citrusy stuff are the ones that make people have weird reactions.
[08:21.090 --> 08:26.290]  So is it the strain specific that you are allergic to? And I'm saying allergic. That's
[08:26.290 --> 08:31.650]  the next thing I'm working into. Maybe there's something in the trichomes, in the leaf oil.
[08:31.650 --> 08:36.190]  Maybe there's just something simply in that plant at this point of that plant stage of
[08:36.190 --> 08:40.270]  growth that you were allergic to. Maybe your body rubbed up against it. It says, that's
[08:40.270 --> 08:44.310]  a lot of trichomes to be on my arm. That's a lot of whatever oil is in that trichome.
[08:44.310 --> 08:49.050]  There are terpenes, paleots, esters, fucking plant alcohols. There are a bunch of things
[08:49.050 --> 08:53.930]  happening in that plant. There's bioactivity happening. Maybe you got some of that. So
[08:53.930 --> 08:58.170]  maybe you're allergic to the pesticide. Maybe you're allergic to a foliar feed. Maybe you
[08:58.170 --> 09:03.450]  are allergic to that specific plant. Maybe you're allergic to cannabis. Maybe you're
[09:03.450 --> 09:07.590]  allergic to cannabis at that stage of growth. All of these things are possible. Also, maybe
[09:07.590 --> 09:11.850]  a bug did something weird in there. I don't know what kind of pest you've got. Maybe a
[09:11.850 --> 09:14.930]  pest did something in there. I don't know those options. I'm just trying to keep our
[09:14.930 --> 09:18.750]  minds open and kind of filter through and make sure I give you ideas of what could have
[09:18.750 --> 09:24.090]  gone on. Most likely, it was a pesticide. That would be the most obvious thing, or a
[09:24.090 --> 09:28.850]  foliar feed. I've seen people break out in weird, they get tiger stripes, they get weird
[09:28.850 --> 09:32.730]  fucking rashes up and down their arms, then it comes across the back of their body. I've
[09:32.730 --> 09:37.610]  seen weird shit from pesticide exposure. Google your symptoms and see if it looks like
[09:37.610 --> 09:42.410]  pesticide exposure. If you have applied a pesticide, open the back of that package.
[09:42.410 --> 09:45.370]  I've got a water bottle here. I don't have a pesticide handy, but there's a little book
[09:45.370 --> 09:49.690]  right here on the pesticide. If you just pull that open, it'll have all kinds of stuff written
[09:49.690 --> 09:54.490]  inside of there. Hopefully you read that before you applied the pesticide. If not, read it.
[09:54.490 --> 09:59.410]  Find out what the active ingredients are in that pesticide. Then Google the adverse reactions
[09:59.410 --> 10:05.050]  to exposure of that pesticide. Azodirachtin poisoning, azodirachtin exposure, azodirachtin
[10:05.050 --> 10:08.690]  rash on skin. Whatever you applied, I'm just picking azodirachtin because it's a word that
[10:08.690 --> 10:13.410]  I'm familiar with and it was fun to say. Google whatever product you used, exposure, rash
[10:13.410 --> 10:17.610]  on skin, see if that's what you've got going on. Otherwise, I think you're just allergic
[10:17.610 --> 10:22.570]  to that strain or to that specific plant. It may have been timing. See if it happens
[10:22.570 --> 10:28.010]  again the next time you go in there and grow. I recommend to everybody to wear rubber gloves
[10:28.170 --> 10:32.490]  for sure when you're growing. The six millimeter or thicker, are they six millimeter? I think
[10:32.490 --> 10:37.090]  they're six millimeter or thicker nitrile gloves. Then you also want to have long sleeves
[10:37.090 --> 10:42.290]  in the grow. In a grow, I know it's hot, it's warm, but we expose ourselves to all kinds
[10:42.290 --> 10:45.570]  of stuff. Our friend has a rash right here. He wouldn't have gotten a rash on himself
[10:45.570 --> 10:49.890]  if he had long sleeves. Also, those grow lights will give you some sort of skin cancer. If
[10:49.890 --> 10:54.570]  you're in a grow room all day, every day under thousands of watts of lights, I would recommend
[10:54.570 --> 10:58.570]  covering up your skin. Also, always wear eye protection. We're going to do another
[10:58.570 --> 11:04.010]  full episode on grow room safety. That's coming up. Let's stay focused today. I really think
[11:04.010 --> 11:10.090]  it's an allergy to either the plant or a pesticide or a foliar feed or perhaps there's a bug
[11:10.090 --> 11:14.650]  leaving some bullshit around. I'm not sure about that part. I want to hope that you apply
[11:14.650 --> 11:18.090]  to pesticide and that's the problem, that it's not the plants themselves, but that could
[11:18.090 --> 11:22.730]  be the thing. All right, North, North, Terps, I hope I kind of answered your question without
[11:22.730 --> 11:26.610]  more info, without more details, without some sort of scientific analysis. That is
[11:26.610 --> 11:31.090]  what I've got for you, bro. Probably you're allergic to something. Obviously, you're allergic
[11:31.090 --> 11:35.570]  to something and then we just have to decide, is it a pesticide, a foliar feed, the plants,
[11:35.570 --> 11:39.850]  the trichomes? What is it? Why is it? The only way to figure it out is either go stick
[11:39.850 --> 11:44.450]  your arm in there more and see if you get a different rash or wear some shit and don't
[11:44.450 --> 11:48.410]  risk the rash again. Did you get it on your face and stuff, bro? That sucks. I'm sorry.
[11:48.410 --> 11:53.570]  That's got to be uncomfortable. Some calamine lotion and maybe some CBD cream or something
[11:53.570 --> 11:57.010]  and lots of dabs and maybe a shower. All right, I'm going to keep moving forward because I
[11:57.010 --> 12:01.170]  do have several Patreon messages that I'd like to cover. I do promise the folks who
[12:01.170 --> 12:05.170]  contribute on Patreon that I will answer their messages, trying to follow through on all
[12:05.170 --> 12:09.890]  of that, trying to be a good guy. Here is another one from North, North, Terps. It says,
[12:09.890 --> 12:15.570]  shout out to Rasta Jeff and White Mike. Big ups to you, bro. Brother man, one love. I
[12:15.570 --> 12:21.530]  recently made the switch from flora to reggae GH. I'm not sure if he meant to write reggae
[12:21.530 --> 12:25.690]  GH when he switched over to regular general hydro, I think. I'm mixing according to the
[12:25.690 --> 12:33.410]  sheets, but my EC is off the charts. EC is off the charts. You're mixing according to
[12:33.410 --> 12:38.930]  the sheets. Are you starting with RO water? That's what I want to know. If your EC is
[12:38.930 --> 12:43.930]  up higher, maybe your base has already got a couple hundred PPMs of water in it. Before
[12:43.930 --> 12:48.250]  you even add nutrients to your water, fill up your vessel, your container, your reservoir,
[12:48.250 --> 12:52.450]  whatever you're putting the water in, stick your meter in there, see what it says. How
[12:52.450 --> 12:58.530]  many PPMs are in there now? I'm going to say as a guess, just a starting number, 400. Now,
[12:58.530 --> 13:02.930]  when you mix up your nutrients, deduct 400. That is kind of more closely to what you've
[13:02.930 --> 13:07.890]  got. There is shit in there starting you need to take into account, but if you're wondering
[13:07.890 --> 13:12.850]  why the EC is way off, that is one quick way to figure out a little bit. Just deduct the
[13:12.850 --> 13:18.490]  starting number from what you're working with. Then I recommend as you add each nutrient,
[13:18.490 --> 13:23.970]  keep that EC meter in there. If you're starting with 20 milliliters per gallon of base, pour
[13:23.970 --> 13:28.450]  it in there, see what it goes to. Sometimes the nutrient charts will show you what that
[13:28.450 --> 13:34.410]  EC will go to at that rate. If it's going too high, don't add that much. If your goal
[13:34.410 --> 13:39.690]  is 600 and it's shooting right up to 700 with the recommended dosage, don't put that much.
[13:39.690 --> 13:43.370]  Probably just add a little less and just wait until it gets to 600 and then stop adding
[13:43.370 --> 13:49.930]  the nutrient. Then whatever the next nutrient is, probably CalMag. Now you're at 600, you
[13:49.930 --> 13:53.530]  want to put ... I'm just making up numbers. Don't follow my number scale. I'm making these
[13:53.530 --> 13:59.290]  up off the top of my head. You had 600 of base nutrients and then it says 100 PPMs of
[13:59.290 --> 14:03.570]  CalMag. Just pour in the CalMag until you get to 500. Just do it that way instead of
[14:03.570 --> 14:09.050]  using the dosage chart. Use your meter as your measurement and do it that way. My next
[14:09.050 --> 14:16.130]  thing that I'm concerned with is are you using the correct unit of measurement? Are
[14:16.130 --> 14:21.330]  the nutrients measured in teaspoons, tablespoons, milliliters? What is that measured in? Is
[14:21.330 --> 14:27.250]  the water measured in gallons? Is it measured in liters? Is it measured in British gallons
[14:27.250 --> 14:34.290]  or US gallons? That's different shit. I would make sure to read the container, the measurement
[14:34.290 --> 14:39.010]  device, the instructions, the website, the mixing chart, the nutrient calculator, wherever
[14:39.010 --> 14:43.970]  you're getting your info. Read that and make sure that you are using the correct unit of
[14:43.970 --> 14:49.330]  measurements on both sides. Are you using gallons of water or liters of water? Then
[14:49.330 --> 14:53.730]  on the nutrients you're adding, are you using milliliters, ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons?
[14:53.730 --> 14:59.010]  Those are all options. Make sure that you are getting those two things correct. If one
[14:59.010 --> 15:03.250]  of those is off, if you think you're using liters and you're using gallons, you're way
[15:03.250 --> 15:07.170]  off. If you think you're using milliliters and you're using teaspoons or tablespoons,
[15:07.170 --> 15:11.370]  you are way off. If you've got both of those fucked up, you might just get right and be
[15:11.370 --> 15:15.810]  perfect, but it doesn't sound like you've done that. Make sure you're using the correct
[15:15.810 --> 15:21.850]  unit of measurement. Let's see, RO water, correct unit of measurement. I think that
[15:21.850 --> 15:26.530]  is what you need to do. Also, watch the plants. Are the plants happy? That's the most important
[15:26.530 --> 15:31.130]  part of this. When you're mixing it up to the recommended dosages, how are the plants
[15:31.130 --> 15:35.210]  acting? Are they telling you, hey, I'm angry, I need more nutrients? Are they saying, hey,
[15:35.210 --> 15:40.170]  I've had way too much fucking nutrients. I really like that you're checking your EC.
[15:40.170 --> 15:45.010]  Also, I want to know what you mean by off the charts because I go a little bit high
[15:45.010 --> 15:49.730]  when it goes to EC and PPM. Also, here's the other thing I was trying to remember. Is your
[15:49.730 --> 15:54.150]  meter properly calibrated? Test it to other meters. Make sure that that thing is reading
[15:54.150 --> 15:58.210]  the same as other meters. Do you have a friend with another EC or PPM meter? Can you go to
[15:58.210 --> 16:01.970]  the growth store and test it to one of theirs? Find somebody else with another meter. Make
[16:01.970 --> 16:06.730]  sure that your meter is accurate because just like mixing your nutrients in the wrong size
[16:06.730 --> 16:11.490]  of proportions to water to milliliters or whatever we're using, if your meter is wrong,
[16:11.490 --> 16:16.650]  your meter is wrong, you're never going to get it dialed in correctly. That is my advice.
[16:16.650 --> 16:21.730]  Are you using RO water? Deduct the amount of starting PPMs or EC there. Are you using
[16:21.730 --> 16:27.810]  the correct unit of measurement? Is your measuring device dialed in? Are the plants happy? That's
[16:27.810 --> 16:31.930]  the most important part of the whole thing. Where are you getting your information? Is
[16:31.930 --> 16:37.890]  it coming from the website, the bottles? Is it inside the box? Then verify that you've
[16:37.890 --> 16:42.170]  read that correctly. All right. I want to keep moving because I can get quite rambly.
[16:42.170 --> 16:46.530]  Let's jump right into the next message. Let's see. We've got too many from North Terps.
[16:46.530 --> 16:49.770]  I love you, North, but I'm not going to read three of your messages back to back. Let's
[16:49.770 --> 16:55.090]  jump in and help out our friend OG Purple Thumb with a great message here. It says,
[16:55.450 --> 17:00.730]  Hey, Ross to Jeff. I have an IPM question for you today. Have you ever used Pyganic? Yes,
[17:00.730 --> 17:06.890]  we use Pyganic. Fucking stumble all over that one, but we still use it. I use Pyganic in a
[17:06.890 --> 17:11.850]  commercial environment quite regularly. It is part of the rotation. I prefer Evergreen,
[17:11.850 --> 17:16.810]  but Pyganic is basically the same product. I think our distributor gives us Evergreen for
[17:16.810 --> 17:21.850]  a better price. That is why we've chosen the Evergreen over the Pyganic, but we do use it.
[17:22.050 --> 17:28.210]  I think we use it. Don't quote me here. Read the bottle, do your own research. Approximately 15 to
[17:28.210 --> 17:34.370]  30 milliliters per gallon of water in a tank mix with other pesticides. I do use Pyganic.
[17:34.370 --> 17:41.250]  Then it says, I also believe you said you use Botaniguard. Yes, I use Botaniguard Max. I think
[17:41.250 --> 17:46.890]  we use that one somewhere around 15 to 45 mils per gallon, depending on what else we're mixing
[17:46.890 --> 17:53.130]  it with and the pest we're trying to attack and also size of the plants. Do not quote me and do
[17:53.130 --> 17:58.530]  not risk your plants on my dilution levels. Make sure you test on your garden first. Read the label,
[17:58.530 --> 18:02.690]  read the fucking manual, follow all of the instructions on a pesticide. This is not just
[18:02.690 --> 18:07.890]  for OG Purple Thumb. This is for everybody. If you're using a pesticide, be very careful. In the
[18:07.890 --> 18:12.650]  last email, we've got somebody who may have been exposed to a pesticide. They may have a rash from
[18:12.650 --> 18:18.250]  a pesticide. I have seen the outcome of pesticide exposure. It can be very mild. It can also be very,
[18:18.250 --> 18:23.290]  very scary. I've seen people go into anaphylactic shock because of pesticide exposure. You guys,
[18:23.290 --> 18:27.610]  that shit is no fun. You have to take people to the hospital. They have to take medicine. You have
[18:27.610 --> 18:32.090]  to fill out a fucking incident report. It's not a good time. So be very careful when you're applying
[18:32.090 --> 18:37.170]  pesticides. Read the fucking manuals. Wear all of the proper protective personal equipment. Wear
[18:37.170 --> 18:42.610]  some goggles, wear gloves, long sleeves, suit up, wear good shoes, take a shower right after if you
[18:42.610 --> 18:46.770]  can. Be aware of what you're doing and then consider that everywhere that you've sprayed is
[18:46.770 --> 18:52.570]  now a contaminated pesticide area. If you sprayed in a room, that wall, that light, that doorknob,
[18:52.570 --> 18:56.650]  it's all coated in pesticides. Keep that shit in mind the next time you go in there. Just because
[18:56.650 --> 19:00.050]  you're not spraying today doesn't mean there's not pesticide available for you to come into
[19:00.050 --> 19:04.290]  contact with. I'm on to a good rant just like I thought I would be after those dabs. I want to
[19:04.290 --> 19:10.690]  keep moving here. I do use Botanigard Max. I do use Pyganic. I also use the Evergreen. We're
[19:10.690 --> 19:15.290]  going to talk about another pesticide here in a moment. It says both have pyrethrum but I see
[19:15.290 --> 19:21.850]  Botanigard has BB also. What do you recommend for a soil mite knockdown? There are way too many for
[19:21.850 --> 19:27.650]  my liking. I hope you're having a great weekend brother. All right so we've got soil mites. Are
[19:27.650 --> 19:32.330]  you sure they are soil mites? Have you verified that they are soil mites? That is the first course
[19:32.330 --> 19:37.850]  of action. Verify that we are battling the right enemy. If you've got the wrong bug, the wrong
[19:37.970 --> 19:41.690]  enemy, you may be treating for the wrong shit. You'll never get rid of your cancer if you keep
[19:41.690 --> 19:47.050]  treating for the flu. So make sure that's what you've got. Do you also have regular fucking
[19:47.050 --> 19:51.210]  eat your plant spider mites that are going up and leaving the soil because you're probably
[19:51.210 --> 19:55.650]  gonna have both if you've got one. Now let's talk about ways to get rid of these guys. You've
[19:55.650 --> 20:01.970]  mentioned Pyganic and Botanigard Max. I also like Venerate. So those are three great products. Be
[20:01.970 --> 20:06.610]  careful with the Venerate. I've seen it give people pesticide problems, rashes and shit. So
[20:06.650 --> 20:12.370]  that's the most toxic one I think I've used in my commercial facilities. The one that I've seen
[20:12.370 --> 20:16.650]  the most problems, the most outcome from people not using properly. So be careful with that one.
[20:16.650 --> 20:22.250]  But how are we going to get rid of your soil mites? They're in the soil. So we need to mix
[20:22.250 --> 20:26.730]  up a pesticide. In my opinion, in my experience, in my professional case, this is what I would do.
[20:26.730 --> 20:32.690]  I would mix a pesticide into my watering reservoir. Whatever you water from, if you've got a big trash
[20:32.850 --> 20:38.530]  can that you make your nutrients and water into, fill that bitch up with water. Then put the
[20:38.530 --> 20:43.850]  recommended dosage of whatever pesticide you choose to use. You can use Pyganic, you can use
[20:43.850 --> 20:48.650]  Botanigard or you can use Venerate. They will all eradicate the pest you were trying to get rid of
[20:48.650 --> 20:53.810]  if it's a soil mite. It sounds like you've probably got Pyganic. So let's do Pyganic on the first day.
[20:53.810 --> 20:59.210]  Fill up your reservoir, put the Pyganic in there, water your plants to run off. You want to get at
[20:59.210 --> 21:04.450]  least 10 to 20% runoff. You want water coming out of the bottoms of the pots. This tells us we have
[21:04.450 --> 21:10.170]  soaked all of the surface area of that soil or soilless mix or cocoa, whatever you're using. So
[21:10.170 --> 21:17.290]  maybe 15 or 20 mils of Pyganic in a fucking big vat of water. Then water the plants to run off.
[21:17.290 --> 21:21.610]  Then give it two or three days and wait and see what happens. These bugs are gonna die slowly,
[21:21.610 --> 21:27.210]  but give them time to see what happens. Now if you were in veg, I would go ahead and apply a
[21:27.930 --> 21:33.610]  sprayed pesticide application at the same time. These bugs are gonna go, shit, we're getting bombed,
[21:33.610 --> 21:37.450]  we're getting destroyed down here, I need some more to go. They're gonna try to run up into the
[21:37.450 --> 21:42.210]  plants. If you've got one type of mite, there's a good chance you've got another pest in there.
[21:42.210 --> 21:47.890]  Why not treat for everything while we're at it? So spray a pesticide, spray the Pyganic at the
[21:47.890 --> 21:53.650]  same time. Mix up 15 maybe 20 mils per gallon, give it a hit. Then let's watch for three days
[21:53.650 --> 21:59.410]  and see what we get. Are the bugs gone? Maybe, probably, maybe not. So what are we gonna do?
[21:59.410 --> 22:05.010]  We're gonna mix up another batch of pesticides and we're gonna dredge that soil one more time
[22:05.010 --> 22:10.610]  to see if anything climbs out. So give the pots a smack, see if anything comes climbing out. Do you
[22:10.610 --> 22:14.610]  have any little fungus gnats flying out? Do you see soil mites come climbing up the stem? Do they
[22:14.610 --> 22:19.890]  run out of the sides of the pots? Pull the, if you got a fabric pot, pull the fabric pot away from the
[22:19.890 --> 22:24.850]  medium and look down in there. Is there shit moving? You'll know. Did a bunch of mites run out
[22:24.850 --> 22:29.330]  of that run out water, the runoff water when you watered 20% extra? Do you see little carcasses?
[22:29.330 --> 22:34.370]  They reflect in the water. If you shine a light on it, the little reflective dots, dead bugs. You're
[22:34.370 --> 22:39.410]  working towards your goal. So the next time it's time to water, you can mix your nutrients into
[22:39.410 --> 22:44.130]  this batch if you want to. Or if you don't want to put nutrients in it, don't. But I would use a
[22:44.130 --> 22:49.650]  different pesticide. If you use the Pyganic last time, this time let's use Botanigard Max. We give
[22:49.650 --> 22:54.210]  them a right fucking right hook last time. Let's send them a fucking left one right to the fucking
[22:54.210 --> 22:58.050]  jaw this time. We don't need to hit them with two rights. They know the right's coming. They felt
[22:58.050 --> 23:01.890]  the right. It hurts. Let's give them a left. Let's switch it up. Let's give them Botanigard. Now they
[23:01.890 --> 23:06.610]  got a one-two punch three days apart from each other. Kapow, kapow. They don't know what to do.
[23:06.610 --> 23:11.250]  They can't adjust. They can't fucking get used to that many pesticides that quickly. You've given
[23:11.250 --> 23:16.290]  them Pyganic. You've given them Botanigard. Now let's inspect again. Let's let the soil dry up a
[23:16.290 --> 23:21.330]  little bit. See if we see anything. If you see any signs of bugs, let's do it again. And let's also
[23:21.330 --> 23:26.370]  spray. I may do the Pyganic again next time. And then I would also spray. You've got the option.
[23:26.370 --> 23:31.650]  If you've got Pyganic and Botanigard, spray either one of those that you feel necessary if you still
[23:31.650 --> 23:37.730]  see a pest problem. So we're going to hit it first time with Pyganic in a soil dredge. We're going to
[23:37.730 --> 23:42.690]  let that dry. We're going to check for the presence of bugs. I would do it again with or without the
[23:42.690 --> 23:47.970]  presence of bugs. Switch the pesticide. Do it again. As long as the plants recovered well from the last
[23:47.970 --> 23:51.890]  one. Sometimes they'll get a little pissy. If they've been getting attacked and you over did it with
[23:51.890 --> 23:56.690]  the pesticide, they'll get a little angry at you. But we got to get rid of the bugs. So if they
[23:56.690 --> 24:01.970]  recovered well, let's do it again. And let's also maybe consider spraying at the first time, the
[24:01.970 --> 24:07.010]  second time, or the third time. So first time we're going to do a dredge. I would recommend spraying.
[24:07.010 --> 24:13.090]  Check for bugs, then dredge again. Any bugs, dredge and spray again. Then if you've still got bugs,
[24:13.090 --> 24:17.410]  we've got to step up our game. We need to get Venerate or a stronger pesticide in there. Maybe
[24:17.410 --> 24:22.610]  consider releasing some predators that will get in there and attack a little more heavily. So that's
[24:22.610 --> 24:28.130]  my strategy. That's what I would start off with. Drench them, spray them, then drench them again,
[24:28.130 --> 24:33.330]  then drench and spray again. Then reassess the situation and hope we have successfully eradicated
[24:33.330 --> 24:38.290]  all of the bugs. If you want to be the guy that puts a layer of diatomaceous earth across the top
[24:38.290 --> 24:43.730]  of your soil, you can do that. Do it when the soil is kind of dry and don't get that shit too wet too
[24:43.730 --> 24:49.250]  soon because it only works when it's dry. I think it takes a lot of time and it's not cost-effective.
[24:49.250 --> 24:55.090]  All right, big shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb for the great question on Patreon. Let's keep
[24:55.090 --> 25:01.890]  it moving because I am fucking chatty and we have got a lot of Patreon messages. This is a great one.
[25:01.890 --> 25:07.490]  Did they sign their name? Yes, this one comes from Super Lemonade 420. Big shout out, buddy. I see you
[25:07.490 --> 25:12.210]  popping up quite a bit. Thank you for all of the support. This message, oh sorry for all the paper
[25:12.210 --> 25:16.690]  noise, I am using the lapel mic again and you're going to catch a lot of extra noises. I apologize
[25:16.690 --> 25:22.770]  for that. That was my paper sticking to the sticky dab mat here at the table. Welcome to the real
[25:22.770 --> 25:26.770]  world. Yes, I'm a real person over here doing a show. This message goes like this. It says, hey
[25:27.170 --> 25:32.450]  Rasta Jeff, if this question makes it, you can use my name on the show. Man, I'm glad you said that
[25:32.450 --> 25:36.930]  because I already done used your name on the show. It says, I just got set up on yours and on Mike's
[25:36.930 --> 25:42.370]  Patreon. Hey, thank you. I appreciate it and Mike thanks you for supporting him on Patreon. I'll give
[25:42.370 --> 25:46.370]  Mike a shout out right now. If you have listened to the show and you've heard my good buddy White
[25:46.370 --> 25:51.650]  Mike on the show and you would like to support his Patreon, visit him at patreon.com forward
[25:51.650 --> 25:56.290]  slash white Mike. Give him some support. Give him some love. Let him know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[25:56.370 --> 26:01.170]  He does deserve all of the support. It goes on. It says, I was wondering if you could do an episode
[26:01.170 --> 26:06.930]  on the TMNT line. Maybe you could spend some more time on the blue raspberry truffle as it is the
[26:06.930 --> 26:12.530]  pollen donor for the whole line. There's a couple things to talk about there. Another episode on the
[26:12.530 --> 26:20.450]  TMNT line. I did a full episode on the TMNT line. If you go to YouTube and you go to my playlist,
[26:20.450 --> 26:25.890]  go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, I have got a list of playlists. If you look on the playlist,
[26:25.890 --> 26:32.290]  there is a playlist called strain descriptions. Inside of that playlist, it says six strains.
[26:32.290 --> 26:38.130]  That is the TMNT episode where I described the original six that I released. I did not put
[26:38.130 --> 26:42.130]  shredder in there. He was not released at the time. Maybe I should do an episode on shredder,
[26:42.130 --> 26:48.130]  but there is a full episode on the TMNT line. Then it says, maybe you could spend more time
[26:48.130 --> 26:53.010]  on the blue raspberry truffle as it's the pollen donor. I must make a correction. The blue raspberry
[26:53.010 --> 26:58.290]  truffle is not the pollen donor. The blueberry cookies is the pollen donor. I know that's very
[26:58.290 --> 27:03.810]  confusing. I've got a lot of options, a lot of offerings. The blue raspberry truffle is blueberry
[27:03.810 --> 27:08.850]  cookies to arise. That's its own cross. The blueberry cookies is its own thing. That is the
[27:08.850 --> 27:16.290]  one I reversed to make the TMNT line to make the Leonardo. That is blueberry cookies and Tahoe OG.
[27:16.290 --> 27:19.970]  I feel like there's more to that that I am missing in the name description. I wasn't prepared to say
[27:19.970 --> 27:25.250]  that out loud. Didn't research that. Didn't write it down. One minor correction there. It is the
[27:25.250 --> 27:30.530]  blueberry cookies is the one that I used to reverse it. I'll talk to make that the one that I reversed.
[27:30.530 --> 27:36.690]  I'll talk briefly about it. Blueberry cookies smells, it's got this blueberry and cookies aroma.
[27:36.690 --> 27:43.090]  Girl Scout cookies has a peppery minty sort of aroma and flavor. That comes through and then
[27:43.090 --> 27:49.170]  it's mixed with that sweet blueberry candy flavor. I always describe the flavor often as when we were
[27:49.170 --> 27:53.330]  younger there were blue lollipops that would make my mouth and my tongue completely blue and they
[27:53.330 --> 27:57.090]  were blue raspberry and they may have had gum in the middle. I always got rid of the gum. I'm not
[27:57.090 --> 28:03.970]  into that. But they taste, the buds taste and smell like that lollipop and that's where the blue raspberry
[28:03.970 --> 28:09.170]  name came from. It's blueberry cookies. That's why I got the blue raspberry truffle name out of there.
[28:09.170 --> 28:14.130]  It grows kind of tall but it's worth it. It makes big giant fucking colas. It's really potent. It's
[28:14.130 --> 28:19.570]  really frosty. It's very photogenic. It's kind of easy to grow. It's got big fat leaves. It takes a lot
[28:19.570 --> 28:24.930]  of nutrients. But that's the blueberry cookies that I use. I'm going to be using that in a lot
[28:24.930 --> 28:28.690]  of things. It's the blue pill which will have a new name soon. The name is in my head. I haven't
[28:28.690 --> 28:33.330]  released it. The blue pill by the way is the blueberry cookies crossed to the golden goat. I've
[28:33.330 --> 28:37.090]  put a lot of hype around that one. That will be released. I've just got to make a lot more because
[28:37.090 --> 28:44.050]  I know it's going to go too fast. So that is the blueberry cookies. Tahoe and blueberry, blueberry
[28:44.050 --> 28:49.090]  tahoe and thin mint cookies. I hope I got that correct. Coming off the top of my head. I want to
[28:49.090 --> 28:54.610]  keep going though. It says as I grab the whole, I grabbed the S1s and I wanted to try it in its
[28:54.610 --> 28:58.210]  purest form. So that's going to be the blueberry cookies that you've got there. I've also got the
[28:58.210 --> 29:02.370]  blue raspberry truffle. I want to make it clear that that's what you've got is blueberry cookies
[29:02.370 --> 29:07.810]  S1 and not blue raspberry truffle. That's a different line. The blueberry cookies is feminized.
[29:07.810 --> 29:13.410]  The blue raspberry truffle is a non-fem. So it goes on to say shout out to the Dude Grows crew
[29:13.410 --> 29:17.970]  because that's how I found your podcast. A big shout out to the Dude Grows crew, the Dude Grows
[29:17.970 --> 29:22.850]  podcast. If you're not listening to the Dude Grows show, I highly recommend you check out their show.
[29:22.850 --> 29:27.010]  They're probably popping up on the side of the screen right here and recommended videos. The
[29:27.010 --> 29:31.570]  Dude Grows show. Click on them. Give them a subscribe. You'll enjoy their show. If you enjoy my show,
[29:31.570 --> 29:35.010]  they're probably right here, you guys. Right on the side. Scroll down a couple of videos. You'll
[29:35.010 --> 29:39.090]  see them if they're not already there. Shout out to Scotty, the Dude, and Guru. Everybody behind the
[29:39.090 --> 29:45.010]  scenes. Big love to the whole DGC gang. All right. It says I plan to make it to the DGC Cup next year
[29:45.010 --> 29:50.850]  as this year's cup is looking less and less likely. Yes, I do apologize. We're trying to be safe and
[29:50.850 --> 29:55.970]  responsible. We've talked a couple of times about what we can do and the word responsibility comes
[29:55.970 --> 30:00.770]  up every time. It would be very irresponsible of us to throw an event where people come together
[30:00.770 --> 30:06.050]  and we all put our mouth on a device. That sounds gross. We all share the same smoking apparatus
[30:06.050 --> 30:10.530]  and pass it around the room. If one person in there has COVID and everybody gets COVID,
[30:10.530 --> 30:14.770]  one other person gets COVID and we threw that event, it is our fault that more people are sick.
[30:15.330 --> 30:20.130]  We don't want to contribute to that. I say we. I am part of the event, a small part of the event,
[30:20.130 --> 30:24.370]  but I've been a part of the meetings and the Google Docs and the email chains and we've decided
[30:24.370 --> 30:28.690]  to be more responsible and think about the community and not just ourselves in the event.
[30:29.170 --> 30:33.490]  When it's time, it will be time and everybody will know that the DGC Cup will happen.
[30:34.530 --> 30:39.570]  I apologize we can't do it. I was as excited as yourself. That's a very good time for me.
[30:39.570 --> 30:43.490]  I set up a booth in the back of the event and I get to see all of my friends. Everybody comes
[30:43.490 --> 30:48.050]  to me and says what's up. I get showered in gifts and high fives and hugs and praise and love.
[30:49.330 --> 30:52.370]  All my friends are there and they all come to my booth because I'm stuck and I've got a big
[30:52.370 --> 30:57.250]  sign that says I am here. Trust me, bro. I miss that event as well. It's a good time. Shout out
[30:57.250 --> 31:01.650]  to my boys for throwing an amazing party every year. It says I had tickets, but you know COVID
[31:01.650 --> 31:06.850]  and shit. Yeah, COVID and shit, bro. Trust me. I'm looking forward to burning one down and doing
[31:06.850 --> 31:12.770]  some dabs with you. I'm flowering my whole pack of Lemon Jeffrey right now and they are phenomenal.
[31:12.770 --> 31:17.410]  I love hearing the word phenomenal when people talk about my genetics. Big salute. Can't go
[31:17.410 --> 31:25.010]  wrong there. Thank you. Can't wait to smoke them and they will more likely be my entry for the cup
[31:25.010 --> 31:30.050]  next year. I'm not sure if I was supposed to say that, but it sounds like Super Lemonade is going
[31:30.050 --> 31:34.210]  to put some Lemon Jeffrey in the DGC cup. So you guys better bring the fucking heat because that
[31:34.210 --> 31:40.130]  Lemon Jeffrey is a winner every time. All right. Super Lemonade, I feel like I answered your
[31:40.130 --> 31:44.770]  question. There is an episode about the TMNT line. I made a correction about the Blue Raspberry
[31:44.770 --> 31:50.610]  Truffle. I fucking look forward to seeing you at the next event, bro. Don't be shy. A lot of people
[31:50.610 --> 31:54.290]  tell me they're like, hey, bro, I was at this event and I saw you and you looked busy so I
[31:54.290 --> 31:59.490]  didn't come say hi. I'm not busy just because I'm talking to people, high-fiving people, selling
[31:59.490 --> 32:05.650]  seeds, doing high-fives, handshakes, hugs, fist bumps, just running my face. Come be a part of that. That's
[32:05.650 --> 32:10.930]  what I am there for. I am busy waiting for you to come say hi. That's all I'm looking for. So Super
[32:10.930 --> 32:15.570]  Lemonade and everybody else, when you were at the DGC cup or whatever event where you see me, come
[32:15.570 --> 32:21.250]  say what's up. Don't be shy. Even if it's at like Comedy Works or something after a show, if it's at
[32:22.050 --> 32:26.130]  a concert, make sure you come say what's up. If Phish is playing, don't talk to me. Wait till
[32:26.130 --> 32:30.690]  they're done, then come say hi. At a comedy show, don't talk over the comedy show, but absolutely,
[32:30.690 --> 32:35.570]  if you see me on the street in Denver, in Colorado, and you're polite, you're not crazy, say what's up,
[32:35.570 --> 32:39.970]  bro. It's a good time. If I got a date with me, be polite. Say what's up, Rasta Jeff. Love what you do
[32:39.970 --> 32:45.010]  and high-five me and keep moving, but don't be shy, you guys. I love meeting the people, interacting,
[32:45.010 --> 32:50.050]  getting handshakes, getting high-fives. Oftentimes, I've got a pack of seeds in my back pocket. If you
[32:50.050 --> 32:55.090]  say what's up, Rasta Jeff, love the show, you just may get a gift. You never know, so don't be shy.
[32:55.090 --> 33:01.490]  Don't be a stranger. I am six foot five. I've got dreadlocks to my fucking knee section. These
[33:01.490 --> 33:06.450]  things are kind of long. Sometimes, people tell me that I can be intimidating. Bro, I'm super nice.
[33:06.450 --> 33:11.090]  I'm super nice. I'm skinny. I'm friendly. I'm probably dabbed the fuck out. Come say what's up.
[33:11.090 --> 33:14.850]  Super Lemonade, I look forward to meeting you. I also look forward to meeting everybody else
[33:14.850 --> 33:20.450]  at the DGC or whatever the next event is. I cannot wait. You guys, I should wrap it up, but I feel like
[33:20.450 --> 33:24.210]  I'm going to keep going. We're going to do one more episode north. You snuck a lot of episodes in here
[33:24.210 --> 33:29.250]  or a lot of emails in here. Good job, bro. Shout out to North North Terps for his tenacity on getting
[33:29.250 --> 33:35.330]  a bunch of messages onto the show. This one, however, comes from our friend Carl, aka C-Dub.
[33:35.330 --> 33:39.170]  I might not have been supposed to say Carl, but shout out to our buddy C-Dub. Carl, nobody knows who
[33:39.170 --> 33:43.890]  you are, bro. Even if I said your name, you'll be okay. Did not tell him your address yet. Carl lives
[33:43.890 --> 33:49.570]  at 123 High Street. I'm just kidding, you guys. Don't bother Carl. He sent a great message. It goes
[33:49.570 --> 33:55.410]  a lot like this. It says, a quick note to tell you how much I enjoyed the podcast. Thank you. I appreciate
[33:55.410 --> 34:01.250]  that. When Michigan voters passed the Recreational Cannabis Act a couple of years ago, I'd gone 40
[34:01.250 --> 34:07.730]  years without smoking. Oh man, I am 41 years old and I couldn't imagine going that long without
[34:07.730 --> 34:12.290]  smoking. I've been consuming cannabis for more than half of my life and I see no end in sight,
[34:12.290 --> 34:17.170]  bro. So welcome back to the team. It says I sampled some northern lights from my first grow and I found
[34:17.170 --> 34:23.810]  myself in a galaxy far, far away. Sounds like we got a Star Wars fan here. Welcome to the team, bro.
[34:23.810 --> 34:29.330]  I am into my fifth grow now and I have my first real outdoor grow going. Congratulations, buddy.
[34:29.330 --> 34:35.810]  So far, so good. The strains I've grown so far have been hardy to say the least. I have pulled about
[34:35.810 --> 34:42.850]  every dumb trick in the book and yet my plants managed to survive and take my ineptness in stride.
[34:42.850 --> 34:48.770]  These plants are very resilient and that is the best way to learn is to go fuck these plants up.
[34:48.770 --> 34:53.490]  People think I'm some grow guru. I'm like, since you used a Star Wars reference in here, they think
[34:53.490 --> 35:00.530]  I'm Grow Yoda or something or a Grow Jedi. The way you become a Grow Jedi is you do a lot of growing.
[35:00.530 --> 35:05.490]  You just do it a lot and you have to make a lot of mistakes. Do you know how I know that you shouldn't
[35:05.490 --> 35:10.290]  do this and this to the plant because I did that and that and the plants died or they had a bad
[35:10.290 --> 35:15.170]  outcome. My harvest wasn't as good. My potency wasn't desirable. Maybe it didn't taste as good.
[35:15.170 --> 35:19.330]  That's how I learned. Like what happens if I do this to the plant and then you do it and a week
[35:19.330 --> 35:24.370]  later you go, I fucking did some dumb shit to my plants. That's how I have learned a lot. So your
[35:24.370 --> 35:28.530]  plants are teaching you and you're learning from them and also you're getting a very good reward.
[35:28.530 --> 35:33.410]  You're having a satisfying harvest, it sounds like. So that's awesome. I'm going to continue with the
[35:33.410 --> 35:39.170]  message. It says, I appreciate your technical advice. Hey, you're very welcome. I try to be
[35:39.170 --> 35:44.370]  educational and informative without being too technical. I think people that use too many
[35:44.370 --> 35:48.290]  glossary terms and buzzwords and shit, they're trying to look smart and they're doing it for
[35:48.290 --> 35:53.090]  their ego. I'm doing it for you guys. I want you guys to grow the best cannabis possible. There's
[35:53.090 --> 35:58.130]  no reason why there should be some elitist club. We should all be growing the best ganja on the
[35:58.130 --> 36:03.170]  planet. So I'm glad you think that my advice is technical. It says, more importantly, I appreciate
[36:03.170 --> 36:07.970]  your attitude, your ability to communicate and your willingness to admit that you're learning
[36:07.970 --> 36:13.650]  as are the rest of us. Oh yeah, man, this is an ever evolving industry. You are in your fifth
[36:13.650 --> 36:20.530]  grow. I'm probably on my 500th. I'm just being a guesser here. And the technology, the equipment,
[36:20.530 --> 36:26.130]  the demands, the desires, the strains, the science, it evolves every day. No matter how many grows I
[36:26.130 --> 36:31.010]  get under my belt, science will be ahead of me. Some other grower, some 19 year old dude on
[36:31.010 --> 36:34.930]  Instagram will be out there discovering some brand new shit that's going to blow my mind.
[36:34.930 --> 36:40.610]  And if I'm not open to it, I limit myself. Like I can't be the best grower that I can be if I'm not
[36:40.610 --> 36:45.810]  open-minded and ready to learn more shit. So I'm a student just like you. I may be a black belt,
[36:45.810 --> 36:49.730]  but I want my second and third degree black belts. I may be doing head kicks. I want to do
[36:49.730 --> 36:53.410]  jump spinning, flying head kicks. That's where I always want to be. I want to be next level in
[36:53.410 --> 36:59.890]  almost everything I do. So, um, I'm still learning. I'm still learning every day. I'm a passionately
[36:59.890 --> 37:05.170]  curious person. I like to learn something every day. And I'm glad that you find my attitude,
[37:05.170 --> 37:10.210]  uh, commendable. First of all, thank you. Try to stay positive. I try to stay upbeat. Honestly,
[37:10.210 --> 37:12.690]  I wouldn't come on here and record if I was in a bad mood. I wouldn't come in,
[37:12.690 --> 37:17.570]  but fucking today sucks everybody. Nobody wants to hear that shit. Uh, there's enough of that.
[37:17.570 --> 37:21.810]  Open Facebook. You can have that all day. I try to be the other side of that.
[37:21.810 --> 37:26.210]  Uh, it's a good time out here. We're alive. Uh, most of us are alive. I don't have fucking
[37:26.210 --> 37:29.730]  some life threatening disease right now. I've got a couple of dollars in the bank. I'm healthy. I got
[37:29.730 --> 37:34.610]  a smile on my face. I've got a damn internet connection and a computer life is good for me.
[37:34.610 --> 37:39.570]  So I try to remember that there are people that have way less than I've got. I've got a clean
[37:39.570 --> 37:44.050]  bottle of water. There are people that don't have that. So I keep that in mind. That keeps my
[37:44.050 --> 37:49.810]  attitude positive. I realized that I've created something for myself. Uh, you guys, when I,
[37:49.810 --> 37:53.090]  I hate to think about it. I know I'm going to die one day. I'm not like saying I'm dying. You guys,
[37:53.090 --> 37:56.770]  one day I will die one day. I won't be here. We've seen it happen to other friends of ours.
[37:56.770 --> 38:02.450]  They're not here anymore. When I pass, my work will survive and outlive me. There will be
[38:02.450 --> 38:08.130]  irigenetics strains being grown for years and years after I'm gone. Um, so I appreciate that
[38:08.130 --> 38:11.810]  sort of stuff. I've developed, lost my train of thought here, got excited, but I've developed
[38:11.810 --> 38:15.890]  something. I've created something here. So I appreciate that. That makes me fucking filled
[38:15.890 --> 38:20.610]  with happiness and I don't know, gratitude. I'm grateful for life when you've created something
[38:20.610 --> 38:24.210]  that you know, will outlive you. And I've also, I've got a child and things like that, but I'm
[38:24.210 --> 38:27.330]  trying to stay business mind here. I don't talk too much about my family on the show.
[38:27.330 --> 38:32.610]  Uh, that's not the grow from your family podcast, but my daughter will outlive me. I fucking hope
[38:32.610 --> 38:36.930]  to fucking everything, but my fucking brand will outlive me. So I'm happy to, I've got a lot of
[38:36.930 --> 38:40.930]  great shit and I try to share that with you guys. I try to put that energy into the show.
[38:40.930 --> 38:45.650]  Uh, my ability to communicate. I think communicating is very important, especially
[38:45.650 --> 38:50.690]  oral communication. Also, I think I'm sort of a cannabis historian. I've been
[38:51.250 --> 38:55.490]  witnessing it. A lot of people have a story of what they heard, what they think they know,
[38:55.490 --> 39:01.170]  what somebody told them. I saw a lot of it. I was here. Uh, Colorado had a huge cannabis movement.
[39:01.170 --> 39:06.210]  I was involved in a large part of it. Mike was a large part of getting things legalized.
[39:06.210 --> 39:11.010]  Mike was a big part of our local regulations. We were a part of the first dispensary here in town.
[39:11.010 --> 39:15.410]  We've been involved in a lot of dispensary things. We've been to court cases. We've gone to city
[39:15.410 --> 39:20.530]  council meetings. We've gone to city hall hearings. Um, and I think communication is
[39:20.530 --> 39:23.890]  very important. I keep losing my train of thought because I'm so excited about this subject.
[39:23.890 --> 39:29.010]  Uh, communication is very important. I think, uh, communicating the history of cannabis is
[39:29.010 --> 39:33.170]  also important. So I'm kind of a historian in that part. I'm documenting the actual history
[39:33.170 --> 39:38.850]  and to communicate that clearly and, uh, accurately is very important to me. Also,
[39:38.850 --> 39:43.810]  strain information is very important to me. We're calling it medical marijuana. If we're going to
[39:43.810 --> 39:49.650]  call it medical marijuana, we need documentation. We need accurate, accurate information that I'm a
[39:49.650 --> 39:54.050]  big stickler for accurate information. I'm a pretty laid back dude. I like to have a good time,
[39:54.050 --> 39:59.330]  but when it comes to cannabis history and details, I will chime in and correct some bullshit. So
[39:59.330 --> 40:04.290]  I'm glad you like my ability to communicate as well. And my willingness to admit that I'm
[40:04.290 --> 40:08.130]  learning yet. And I'm never going to stop learning. Hopefully the technology, the equipment and
[40:08.130 --> 40:13.170]  everything keeps evolving. I love going to a commercial facility and some owner is like,
[40:13.170 --> 40:17.650]  yeah, we've got millions of dollars of equipment. I have no idea how to use it. And I'm like, cool.
[40:17.650 --> 40:22.050]  I've never seen any of this shit before. This comes out tomorrow and you guys already have it.
[40:22.050 --> 40:26.530]  Let's learn how to use it. And I get so excited. Then when new people come in, I get to be like,
[40:26.530 --> 40:31.410]  Hey, have you seen the new XP 9,000 PRJ? And they're like, no, I heard they're cool. And I'm
[40:31.410 --> 40:35.570]  like, watch this bro. It links up to my phone and I can do all this cool shit. And I make the lights
[40:35.570 --> 40:39.650]  come on and the sprinklers come on and the lights go off. And then fucking something cycles over
[40:39.650 --> 40:43.010]  here and the dehumidifier comes on and they go, you did that all with your phone. And I'm
[40:43.410 --> 40:46.930]  like, yeah, bro. I learned it like four hours yesterday. And then I get to train new people
[40:46.930 --> 40:53.010]  on new equipment. I know all the advanced shit. I love it. Keeps me excited. This was a very great
[40:53.010 --> 40:57.010]  question. Thank you. It was just a compliment and a couple of rambles, but this one paragraph here
[40:57.970 --> 41:03.170]  got me on a good chant, a good rant. So thank you. I appreciate that. And then it goes on to say
[41:03.170 --> 41:08.130]  without being preachy every morning I visit my garden. I feel a little more in touch
[41:08.130 --> 41:14.050]  with a creator God. Yeah. You're not feeling preachy, bro. If you feel like you're more in
[41:14.050 --> 41:18.930]  touch with whatever created you because of those plants, feel that, embrace that, love that,
[41:19.570 --> 41:23.730]  give thanks to it, acknowledge it, feel that throughout the day. Don't just have that feeling
[41:23.730 --> 41:27.730]  when you're in there with the plants. Have that feeling in your heart and your mind and your body
[41:27.730 --> 41:31.250]  from your toes to your head all day, every day. You can feel that. Take that with you.
[41:32.210 --> 41:37.490]  I get to feel that. In a commercial grow, it's very sterile. It's very robotic. It's very
[41:37.490 --> 41:42.450]  commercial. It's very fucking processy, but I do take some time to touch the plants,
[41:42.450 --> 41:48.210]  feel them. I do what I call is the grower's gaze. You'll catch me occasionally standing at the door
[41:48.210 --> 41:52.130]  when I'm done. Everything is swept up. The plants are watered. It's time to go. We could leave if
[41:52.130 --> 41:56.770]  we wanted to, but instead I'm just standing there at the door staring off into the plants,
[41:56.770 --> 42:02.610]  just looking, looking at the canopy, looking at the leaves, looking at the fans blow through,
[42:02.610 --> 42:09.170]  looking at the lights. That's when I notice things. That is when I'm just enjoying the
[42:09.170 --> 42:12.850]  plants, but then I notice that air conditioner is dripping or that dehumidifier is making a
[42:12.850 --> 42:16.450]  funny noise. When I'm doing that grower's gaze, that's when I notice a lot of shit,
[42:16.450 --> 42:20.290]  but you'll catch me just staring off into the plants. That's feeling the feeling that you're
[42:20.290 --> 42:25.250]  talking about, that connection, that oneness. It's the same feeling I get when I go out into nature.
[42:25.250 --> 42:28.690]  I try to get that same feeling in the grow. When you go out into nature and you feel trees all
[42:28.690 --> 42:32.450]  around you, you get that hippie, dippy connection feeling. There's something real to that.
[42:33.250 --> 42:37.570]  You're not being preachy. I completely agree with it. Embrace that feeling, my friend. Take that
[42:37.570 --> 42:42.050]  with you all day. Try to spread that vibe to other people. That'll give you that positive attitude
[42:42.050 --> 42:45.330]  that you were talking about that I have earlier. It's from all the plants, dude. It's all the
[42:45.330 --> 42:49.490]  trees, all the nature. Then I get to come home and love on my personal garden. I've got a very
[42:49.490 --> 42:54.290]  small personal grow. I get to love each one of those plants. Every day I get to touch them,
[42:54.290 --> 42:59.810]  defoliate them, smell each leaf, rub the stems, smell the stems. I mix up my nutrients and smell
[42:59.810 --> 43:05.090]  the nutrient mix. I get to enjoy every moment of that. It's very zen. It's very meditative.
[43:05.090 --> 43:09.570]  Then when you smoke that product, you get that meditative zen feeling all over again.
[43:09.570 --> 43:13.570]  Then you close your eyes and play little drums. You really feel good. You get that connection with
[43:13.570 --> 43:17.730]  whatever you believe in. You know what I believe in. They call me Rasta Jeff. I got a Rasta flag
[43:17.730 --> 43:22.450]  behind me. You know I believe in the most I jaw. Whatever you believe in, love that, embrace it,
[43:22.450 --> 43:26.770]  take it with you all day. So the next line is keep up the very good work. Blessings to you and
[43:26.770 --> 43:33.810]  your family. Thank you. I appreciate that. Then they sign it Carl aka C Dub. Big up C Dub. Thank you.
