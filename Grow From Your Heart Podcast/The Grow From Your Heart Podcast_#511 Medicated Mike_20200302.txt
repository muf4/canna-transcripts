[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  And that was the last time we ever saw Larry the Midget.
[00:02.600 --> 00:04.100]  But anyway, let's start a podcast.
[00:04.100 --> 00:05.840]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:05.840 --> 00:09.780]  It is time for episode 511 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.780]  White Mike is across the table from me.
[00:11.780 --> 00:12.940]  I just gave him a dab.
[00:12.940 --> 00:14.040]  It's got him coughing.
[00:14.040 --> 00:15.800]  He has changed about four different colors.
[00:15.800 --> 00:17.680]  He's almost back to his normal color.
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.340]  The drool has slowed down.
[00:19.340 --> 00:20.540]  Welcome to the show, Mike.
[00:20.540 --> 00:21.700]  What's up, everybody?
[00:21.700 --> 00:22.640]  Thank you for being here, bro.
[00:22.640 --> 00:25.140]  Thank you for taking time out of your busy dad schedule
[00:25.140 --> 00:27.140]  and the moving life to come join me on a show.
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.480]  It's been fun lately,
[00:28.480 --> 00:31.780]  but it feels good to get out of the house and hell yeah, it's time to do a show.
[00:31.980 --> 00:35.280]  When I texted you, I asked if you could get your day pass and come spend
[00:35.280 --> 00:37.620]  some time over and the pass was granted.
[00:37.620 --> 00:39.960]  So I'm glad I'm glad you're able to get free for a moment.
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.320]  It's it was just luck, but it had fate aligned.
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.560]  And I we needed to we needed to record his voice.
[00:47.560 --> 00:48.660]  We'll catch up soon, you guys.
[00:48.660 --> 00:49.960]  Yeah, I got dad throat.
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.960]  He said fate aligned and he did just take a dab that it was a fate
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.260]  punch to the face. So he'll be all right momentarily.
[00:56.260 --> 00:58.960]  I will speak while Mike gets his life together over there.
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.060]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at seeds here now dot com

[01:28.320 --> 01:30.820]  Certainly. I just had a question about that promo code, bro.
[01:30.840 --> 01:31.680]  Let's hear that, bro.
[01:31.680 --> 01:34.840]  Is that the number 10 as in one zero or the word?
[01:35.140 --> 01:36.480]  That is a very good question, Mike.
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.240]  I'm glad you're here today to ask that.
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.820]  My eyes had that question.
[01:39.820 --> 01:42.640]  Same question a couple of episodes ago when I was listening to the car.
[01:42.680 --> 01:44.340]  I'm glad I'm here today to ask it.
[01:44.340 --> 01:49.480]  That question is GFYH10 the numerals.
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.180]  So, yes, GFYH grow from your heart and then 10 for 10% off.
[01:54.620 --> 01:56.020]  And where do you get that, Mike?

[01:58.220 --> 01:58.700]  That's right.
[01:58.700 --> 02:00.820]  Seeds here now dot com.
[02:00.860 --> 02:02.820]  Big shout out to all my friends at seeds here now dot com.
[02:02.820 --> 02:06.060]  Not only did they help me out, but we're also friends.
[02:06.100 --> 02:07.660]  So big shout out to everybody over there.
[02:08.020 --> 02:11.500]  Um, we start the show off generally by talking about what we are smoking.
[02:11.700 --> 02:14.260]  If you're wondering why the show started a little.
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.260]  Screw be that it's because of, I'm just fine, bro.
[02:18.260 --> 02:20.160]  I think you're the one that is, did you say screw me?
[02:20.200 --> 02:20.800]  Screw me.
[02:20.960 --> 02:22.080]  Was that the word you went with?
[02:22.080 --> 02:22.860]  I've never heard.
[02:22.860 --> 02:24.340]  What does that even mean, bro?
[02:24.460 --> 02:27.220]  Some people know this situation here.
[02:27.280 --> 02:28.140]  This is screwy.
[02:29.040 --> 02:30.440]  Screwy doobie do bro.
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.620]  Uh, we're smoking the fuzzy naval.
[02:32.920 --> 02:33.640]  Plus cheese.
[02:33.640 --> 02:34.940]  What'd you do to my face?
[02:35.700 --> 02:36.860]  Now I'm all screwy.
[02:37.120 --> 02:37.620]  I get it.
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.040]  I get it.
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.880]  Now we're smoking fuzzy naval live batter.
[02:41.880 --> 02:43.260]  It's harder to say than it sounds.
[02:43.260 --> 02:46.200]  You guys fuzzy naval live batter from green dot labs.
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.660]  This is a blend of.
[02:47.940 --> 02:51.180]  Jilly 13 and peach Oz on the package.
[02:51.180 --> 02:55.760]  The flavor is described as orange push pop and peach daiquiri.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.840]  You know, I'm going to say it's pretty close to that.
[02:57.840 --> 02:59.800]  It had the name is fuzzy naval.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.760]  I tasted the carbonation and some fuzzy, like when you have a peach or some fuzzy
[03:04.760 --> 03:06.720]  fruit, you can taste that, that fuzz on there.
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.360]  And I tasted that with the dab, which was kind of interesting.
[03:09.780 --> 03:11.360]  It tasted like a soda to me.
[03:11.360 --> 03:15.420]  I did not read the description before I dabbed it of what the flavor should taste.
[03:16.160 --> 03:18.740]  I would say I got the daiquiri and the orange push pop, but it was more
[03:18.740 --> 03:20.240]  like an orange soda kind of.
[03:20.440 --> 03:20.940]  Yep.
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.640]  Um, I love your discerning description.
[03:24.120 --> 03:24.620]  Yep.
[03:24.780 --> 03:27.560]  There's like, I can even taste the pulp a little bit.
[03:27.720 --> 03:29.000]  Like, and that's the part I'm calling.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.280]  It's very orange.
[03:30.280 --> 03:30.840]  Mimosa.
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.560]  E or mimosa is the word I'm looking for in my head.
[03:33.560 --> 03:34.040]  Problem.
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.640]  So champagne, more orange.
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.080]  I think very mimosa E is the word that my brain, my Rolodex of flavors was trying
[03:41.080 --> 03:43.200]  to find mimosa E is what I want.
[03:43.200 --> 03:43.880]  And thank you, Mike.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.060]  That's a really good, I'm sorry.
[03:45.060 --> 03:45.760]  I made fun of you, bro.
[03:45.760 --> 03:46.760]  I'll never do it again.
[03:46.960 --> 03:49.360]  It's just never doubted to your flavor palette.
[03:49.660 --> 03:51.900]  Every now and then I nod to answer a question.
[03:51.940 --> 03:53.900]  Sometimes bro, you've got something useful.
[03:53.900 --> 03:56.020]  The other times I'm just like, Oh, he said that.
[03:56.660 --> 04:01.020]  Anyway, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends on Patreon
[04:01.020 --> 04:02.540]  without our friends on Patreon.
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.940]  This show would not be what it is.
[04:05.060 --> 04:08.300]  So let's start off with a big giant shout out to my friend.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.300]  How about a big giant shout out to Scott Ryan?
[04:10.540 --> 04:12.740]  How about a big fist bump to red beard?
[04:12.860 --> 04:14.300]  I always want to send a big thank you.
[04:14.300 --> 04:15.060]  Shout out to my buddy.
[04:15.060 --> 04:16.100]  Grimbold and drew it.
[04:16.360 --> 04:19.400]  Let's pass a big fat joint over to my friend prospect.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.600]  I want to give a big giant dab to my buddy.
[04:21.640 --> 04:22.680]  Oh, G purple thumb.
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.640]  I always want to send a big thank you to Kimatic and last, but certainly not
[04:27.640 --> 04:31.080]  least, I want to send a big giant grow from your heart podcast.
[04:31.320 --> 04:31.900]  Thank you.
[04:32.080 --> 04:34.400]  Shout out and a fist bump to my buddy.
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.320]  Nor Cal Irie.
[04:36.520 --> 04:37.120]  Big thanks.
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.160]  Big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.000]  I know I keep saying this, but if you would like to support the show, you
[04:44.020 --> 04:50.700]  must visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:50.700 --> 04:52.620]  You have to type in that full URL.
[04:52.820 --> 04:56.980]  You can't go to Patreon and then rely on their search bar to find the show.
[04:56.980 --> 05:00.740]  It will not work to make it easy for you, for my friends out there
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.620]  who would like to support.
[05:01.620 --> 05:05.840]  I left a link in the show notes or in the comment section.
[05:06.060 --> 05:08.140]  It should be easy to find click on the link.
[05:08.140 --> 05:12.320]  It will take you to my Patreon campaign again, big shout out.
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.660]  And thank you to everybody who has been supporting the show via Patreon.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.900]  All right, Mike, that is all of the business part.
[05:18.900 --> 05:20.860]  Let's get to the fun part of the show.
[05:20.860 --> 05:26.220]  I love having you on the podcast because it is a mix of educational, informational,
[05:26.640 --> 05:29.280]  and then rambly crazy nonsense.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.620]  It's a beautiful mix of stuff.
[05:30.620 --> 05:33.800]  Educational, entertaining, nonsensical rambles, hashtag.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.920]  They love it when we ramble.
[05:35.340 --> 05:37.600]  Uh, what is you got any rambles for us today?
[05:37.600 --> 05:40.920]  Did you come preloaded with any topics or do we need to go scour the internet
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.580]  for something to get Mike fired up with?
[05:42.760 --> 05:44.460]  We're going to have to shake some stuff out today.
[05:44.480 --> 05:47.760]  There's a, there's just the usual rants folks.
[05:47.800 --> 05:51.660]  It, uh, there's a bunch of States gearing up to fumble a
[05:51.660 --> 05:53.400]  legalization attempt again this year.
[05:54.240 --> 05:59.600]  Um, lots of stuff on the East coast is being talked about, but it looks like
[05:59.600 --> 06:01.560]  New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
[06:02.260 --> 06:05.460]  Um, are going to drag their feet a little bit again on legalization,
[06:05.460 --> 06:10.380]  spend another year exploring options, figuring out tax rates and license
[06:10.380 --> 06:14.520]  fees and zoning rules and, um, not get anywhere.
[06:14.620 --> 06:17.640]  Um, letting the perfect get in the way of the good.
[06:18.780 --> 06:19.900]  If that makes sense,
[06:20.060 --> 06:24.200]  that makes complete sense instead of, uh, I think you said the analogy was
[06:24.420 --> 06:28.580]  they're not going to allow the people to eat because the meal is not perfect yet.
[06:28.660 --> 06:30.260]  Like I get that
[06:33.260 --> 06:35.300]  legalization's huge.
[06:35.380 --> 06:40.340]  Like it's a massive concept changing something that's this big and this
[06:40.340 --> 06:43.420]  ingrained the Colorado didn't get it right.
[06:43.420 --> 06:44.900]  I don't think anybody that's done it yet.
[06:44.900 --> 06:45.720]  It's gotten it right.
[06:46.340 --> 06:48.660]  Um, my throat still feels really weird.
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.380]  So sorry if I sound off.
[06:50.460 --> 06:52.540]  I'm trying to fix your microphone, but we'll get you going.
[06:52.580 --> 06:52.780]  Yeah.
[06:52.820 --> 06:53.340]  Clear throat.
[06:53.340 --> 06:53.580]  Take it.
[06:53.580 --> 06:55.500]  It's a throat thing, not an equipment thing.
[06:56.060 --> 07:03.580]  Um, but, uh, there's a lot of places where there's the rest of this year and
[07:03.580 --> 07:07.820]  next year, they're going to continue arresting mostly poor, mostly minority
[07:07.820 --> 07:15.460]  people for simple possession and distribution and whatnot, a cannabis all
[07:15.460 --> 07:22.100]  because they can't just make a couple of steps towards legalization.
[07:22.180 --> 07:25.780]  They've got to find a way to make sure that it writes all the wrongs of the
[07:25.780 --> 07:29.420]  drug war and evenly distribute stores.
[07:30.140 --> 07:34.180]  There's an equitable amount of minority ownership from the jump and which are
[07:34.180 --> 07:38.740]  all great points, but they're all super lofty goals, but you're never going to
[07:38.740 --> 07:44.740]  solve all of the evils of basic capitalism just because it's marijuana
[07:44.740 --> 07:48.420]  legalization now, um, all in one move.
[07:48.820 --> 07:55.260]  And we're still overcoming all of the same baggage and headaches and hurdles
[07:55.300 --> 07:58.300]  that we've been fighting my whole life, our whole life.
[07:58.900 --> 08:05.100]  Like I was just sitting here thinking that one of my little rants that I could
[08:05.100 --> 08:09.140]  do tonight was that some of the figureheads from the last 20 years of
[08:09.140 --> 08:13.020]  the legalization movement need to sit down and shut the fuck up already.
[08:13.660 --> 08:20.860]  Um, not to put too fine a point on it, but, uh, it's just our, some of those
[08:20.860 --> 08:26.940]  figureheads that were so necessary 15, 20 years ago, just being out front
[08:26.980 --> 08:31.660]  saying I consume cannabis pretty heavily all day, every day.
[08:32.380 --> 08:34.500]  I'm a perfectly rational, normal human.
[08:35.060 --> 08:36.300]  I take care of my shit.
[08:36.340 --> 08:37.580]  I handle my business.
[08:37.740 --> 08:38.820]  I'm not hurting nobody.
[08:39.140 --> 08:40.500]  This shouldn't be a crime.
[08:41.100 --> 08:42.620]  Like the Snoop dogs of the world.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.460]  We needed them.
[08:44.180 --> 08:45.940]  You had, we had to break through the wall.
[08:45.940 --> 08:49.860]  There had to be an example that we could point to and be like, Tommy Chong's
[08:49.860 --> 08:52.820]  been chiefing for all day, every day for forever.
[08:53.540 --> 08:56.660]  If there was going to be a lung cancer thing, we'd have spotted it.
[08:57.300 --> 08:58.500]  You know, we needed that.
[08:59.020 --> 09:02.020]  But at this point, like he's just retweeting tit shots.
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.780]  It just needs to go away.
[09:05.020 --> 09:08.380]  I don't think it needs to go away to stop representing the culture is
[09:08.380 --> 09:09.620]  probably the better way to say that.
[09:09.620 --> 09:11.940]  Let's not say that anybody needs to go away, but yeah.
[09:12.220 --> 09:16.380]  Well, for the longest time, the only representatives are the only people that
[09:16.380 --> 09:20.100]  could represent the cannabis culture were the people that were either
[09:20.100 --> 09:21.900]  bulletproof or had nothing to lose.
[09:22.140 --> 09:26.660]  Musicians, comedians, entertainer types, not attached to any corporation.
[09:26.820 --> 09:30.540]  Nobody that was going to have a boss screaming at him tomorrow.
[09:30.820 --> 09:31.380]  Absolutely.
[09:31.380 --> 09:32.100]  I agree with that.
[09:32.420 --> 09:36.180]  That's partly why I couldn't, I couldn't have been me 15 years ago.
[09:36.860 --> 09:41.260]  Um, when I first came out of college, I was, I still held all the
[09:41.260 --> 09:46.020]  beliefs that I have today, but I couldn't go to city council and
[09:46.020 --> 09:52.460]  vocally fight for good zoning rules for legalization back then.
[09:52.940 --> 09:56.140]  Not just because it wasn't happening back then, but if had I done that, I
[09:56.180 --> 10:00.660]  would have lost my job and that's still very true in parts of the country.
[10:01.260 --> 10:08.300]  Um, and so in some ways, like we do need, um, figureheads like that still,
[10:08.340 --> 10:16.260]  but at the same time, like legalizations never really, or at least not anytime
[10:16.260 --> 10:20.180]  soon, and I'm talking like in the next 30 years, you're going to have a
[10:20.180 --> 10:22.180]  place where it's a hundred percent legal.
[10:22.180 --> 10:25.580]  Nobody's going to hassle you even a little for growing weed in your
[10:25.580 --> 10:27.380]  basement and selling it on Facebook.
[10:28.340 --> 10:31.260]  Like that's not happening in the next 30 years.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.180]  It's just not.
[10:32.260 --> 10:38.940]  And I get that it should, there's nothing wrong with the person in your
[10:38.940 --> 10:44.540]  friend group or your circle or your family or whatever that is in love with
[10:44.540 --> 10:50.340]  and in passionate about and talented at growing cannabis to grow cannabis for
[10:50.340 --> 10:50.980]  your circle.
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.300]  Like that makes perfect sense.
[10:52.300 --> 10:53.820]  That's how we do basically everything else.
[10:53.820 --> 10:55.700]  The people that are good at building ship, build the shit.
[10:55.740 --> 10:58.540]  The people that are good, you know, the mechanic, yeah.
[10:58.540 --> 10:59.420]  Fix up my cars.
[10:59.500 --> 10:59.820]  Yeah.
[10:59.900 --> 11:00.100]  Yeah.
[11:00.140 --> 11:01.100]  That's how everything works.
[11:01.100 --> 11:07.100]  But right now you're going to have to go through and get licensed and follow
[11:07.100 --> 11:14.500]  rules and have zoning guidelines to follow and proper testing reg regimes to
[11:14.500 --> 11:16.740]  follow packaging labels, all of that.
[11:16.740 --> 11:19.140]  And that's how any emerging industry evolves.
[11:19.380 --> 11:21.260]  And this, it's not just any industry.
[11:21.260 --> 11:24.700]  It's not like we invented a, a cooler new sneaker.
[11:25.380 --> 11:26.260]  You know what I mean?
[11:26.380 --> 11:33.060]  Or like when you fucking hairdo or a new instrument, it's, it's cannabis.
[11:33.060 --> 11:34.380]  Like it is an intoxicant.
[11:34.700 --> 11:38.980]  It that's if it wasn't, you know what I mean?
[11:39.220 --> 11:40.900]  But it's also a medicine.
[11:40.940 --> 11:44.540]  It's also, um, part of people's religion.
[11:44.540 --> 11:48.220]  It's also a major part of people's cultures around the world.
[11:48.820 --> 11:56.900]  Um, and it's not just one of those things active at each time.
[11:56.900 --> 12:02.420]  I mean, everybody I know that consumes cannabis, even tangentially, like
[12:02.420 --> 12:07.100]  people that use hemp and hemp based lotions that are made from hemp seed oil.
[12:07.100 --> 12:09.100]  There's not even any CBD in that stuff.
[12:09.100 --> 12:15.380]  It's been on the market for 40 years, but there's multiple things at play.
[12:16.060 --> 12:20.660]  And getting them all addressed is really, really difficult.
[12:21.380 --> 12:26.940]  And it's going to be slow and it's going to be piecemeal and it's going to be two
[12:26.940 --> 12:30.900]  steps forward, one step back, or one step forward, two steps back, depending on
[12:30.900 --> 12:35.820]  where you are and which part of this you're fighting and watching people
[12:36.020 --> 12:41.100]  continue to make no progress because they can't find a way to make all the
[12:41.100 --> 12:44.020]  progress at once is just so frustrating.
[12:44.740 --> 12:46.420]  It's a good way to loop that back around, Mike.
[12:46.780 --> 12:51.780]  And I really like, there was a big article out today that, um, the mayor
[12:51.780 --> 12:56.180]  in New York is going to go on a sightseeing tour of legalization states
[12:56.180 --> 12:58.100]  to see what's going on on the ground there.
[12:58.500 --> 13:02.500]  And two of the states are brand spanking new and the other one's
[13:02.500 --> 13:07.380]  California, which is sort of the biggest stumble block right now.
[13:07.460 --> 13:10.900]  And all the legalization states, if you ask me, at least the ones that's
[13:10.900 --> 13:12.020]  been up and running for a minute.
[13:12.860 --> 13:13.340]  I would agree.
[13:14.460 --> 13:15.260]  It's just so big.
[13:15.260 --> 13:18.140]  It's it's California is its own country.
[13:18.140 --> 13:21.540]  No, like so few people can keep that in their head because it's a state just
[13:21.540 --> 13:26.220]  like we're a state or Maine's a state or Nevada is a state, but it's also like
[13:26.220 --> 13:31.700]  the third largest economy on the world or some shit, like California is massive.
[13:32.180 --> 13:36.660]  The number of people, the amount of square footage, like trying to come up
[13:36.660 --> 13:41.460]  with concert, have comprehensive rules there for anything is a bitch, um, for
[13:41.780 --> 13:44.420]  illegal weed and for the cannabis industry.
[13:44.420 --> 13:49.900]  Like there's just so much history there to overcome and to work through and to
[13:49.900 --> 13:54.780]  work out, like it's going to take another 20 years before the legal cannabis
[13:54.780 --> 13:59.220]  industry in California runs like the one in Colorado, but they have to basically
[13:59.220 --> 14:02.620]  rebuild out there that I think it has to be completely restarted and
[14:02.620 --> 14:04.220]  replanned and from the beginning.
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.260]  But that that's a whole nother fucking can of worms.
[14:07.460 --> 14:10.900]  I agree with what you're saying about some places are asking for too much.
[14:11.180 --> 14:15.060]  We have talked to, I myself have said on this show, when it comes to writing the
[14:15.060 --> 14:19.540]  rules and regulations and the legislation about cannabis in your area to make sure
[14:19.540 --> 14:21.500]  to include somewhere to consume cannabis.
[14:21.500 --> 14:24.380]  And I've tried to make sure to include and cover all of the bases.
[14:24.740 --> 14:25.940]  Maybe that was too much.
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.500]  Maybe we've slowed down some progress because they're asking for too much.
[14:29.500 --> 14:31.620]  Maybe you said, Hey dad, can I go to the party?
[14:31.620 --> 14:32.780]  And dad said, he can go to the party.
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.500]  And now you said, can I wear my tiny skirt?
[14:34.820 --> 14:36.260]  And now dad's like, fuck the whole party.
[14:37.020 --> 14:38.980]  Like, no, you can't even go out of the house now.
[14:39.540 --> 14:45.380]  There's, I mean, places like New York, they're trying to find a way that they
[14:45.380 --> 14:53.060]  can make up for 80 years of systemic racism and bad policy.
[14:54.140 --> 14:56.980]  Like it's, it's just not doable.
[14:57.020 --> 15:04.100]  It's not something that you can fix with a well-crafted law.
[15:04.660 --> 15:09.340]  It's I mean, something like that can only be fixed with 80 years of working the
[15:09.340 --> 15:16.300]  other way and watching them come, come to the table again this year and say,
[15:17.540 --> 15:20.820]  cannabis legalization is an idea whose time has come.
[15:20.860 --> 15:22.540]  Prohibition hasn't worked.
[15:22.580 --> 15:24.420]  The drug war has been a nightmare.
[15:24.420 --> 15:29.580]  It's absolutely decimated, poor minority communities across the country.
[15:29.940 --> 15:32.900]  We don't want anything to do with it anymore, but we're going to keep it
[15:32.900 --> 15:35.660]  going for another year or two while we hammer out the rules.
[15:36.140 --> 15:40.460]  Like it's just so painful to watch.
[15:40.500 --> 15:44.940]  How many people go to jail every year because of cannabis in New York?
[15:44.940 --> 15:46.060]  It's a fuck load.
[15:46.180 --> 15:49.340]  And then not only do they go to jail, once you get arrested and put in the
[15:49.340 --> 15:53.740]  system, you're in the system now to recognize you as somebody who's a problem
[15:53.740 --> 15:55.380]  causer, you're in the system.
[15:55.580 --> 15:57.100]  Now you're probably on probation.
[15:57.100 --> 16:00.500]  Now, if you do something tiny one more time, you're getting locked up.
[16:00.500 --> 16:02.300]  Now that's also on your criminal record.
[16:02.300 --> 16:04.860]  Also on your employment history, you got to write that down.
[16:05.340 --> 16:07.620]  Then you probably got to pay a bunch of fines.
[16:08.580 --> 16:12.540]  If you're a young person in a big city, it's probably already hard to get work.
[16:12.580 --> 16:14.540]  Now you can't get work because you've got a crime.
[16:14.540 --> 16:15.740]  Now you've got to pay fines.
[16:16.020 --> 16:17.380]  You can't even fucking afford to live.
[16:17.380 --> 16:18.580]  So you can't pay those fines.
[16:18.580 --> 16:19.380]  You're not going to do it.
[16:19.380 --> 16:21.020]  You end up in more fucking trouble.
[16:21.540 --> 16:21.780]  Yeah.
[16:21.820 --> 16:24.460]  It's just, it puts people into a shitty fucking cycle.
[16:25.020 --> 16:30.060]  One of the, the talking points I see a lot from the anti-cannabis crowd is
[16:30.740 --> 16:34.860]  there aren't that many people in federal prison for marijuana possession.
[16:35.260 --> 16:37.940]  And they define the stat like that.
[16:38.540 --> 16:40.100]  Very, very, very narrowly.
[16:40.220 --> 16:42.340]  Federal prison is different than jail.
[16:43.060 --> 16:48.420]  Um, being charged with just possession is also very different than being
[16:48.420 --> 16:50.020]  charged with a base marijuana crime.
[16:50.540 --> 16:55.220]  Um, because depending on where you're standing, the vape pen that we've got
[16:55.220 --> 17:01.100]  on the table here that is perfectly legal in, in a place like Texas is a
[17:01.100 --> 17:06.220]  class one felony, even if we've only got a half gram and they're going to charge
[17:06.220 --> 17:09.100]  you for the weight of the pen, including the battery.
[17:09.340 --> 17:14.500]  And so now you're looking at what a quarter pound I'm going to hold this
[17:15.060 --> 17:18.580]  basically classifies six ounces worth of a battery right there.
[17:18.580 --> 17:18.820]  Yeah.
[17:19.220 --> 17:21.820]  I mean, I'm going to hit it with my battery.
[17:21.820 --> 17:24.940]  Like it's not made of helium.
[17:25.220 --> 17:28.740]  The stat is purposefully manipulated to.
[17:29.380 --> 17:34.500]  Um, point out that there are very few people in the harshest prisons are like
[17:34.540 --> 17:40.020]  the most intense prison system, the federal prison system, um, for the, the
[17:40.020 --> 17:44.020]  smallest crime on the books, uh, just possessing a personal use amount of
[17:44.020 --> 17:44.540]  marijuana.
[17:45.140 --> 17:50.420]  Um, they've also got rules depending on where you're standing, that if you go to,
[17:50.700 --> 17:55.300]  to your dealer and buy an eighth, they can't or an eighth a pot and they give
[17:55.300 --> 17:57.460]  it to you in three gram baggies.
[17:58.700 --> 18:03.700]  Like all of a sudden you get pulled over 15 minutes later, stopped and frisked.
[18:03.700 --> 18:06.420]  And that's not an eight you just bought.
[18:06.460 --> 18:08.620]  It's three grams you've got for distribution.
[18:08.660 --> 18:10.660]  That is distribution separate baggies.
[18:10.660 --> 18:10.900]  Yep.
[18:11.020 --> 18:13.460]  I remember one time I went and picked up a quarter back.
[18:13.460 --> 18:17.100]  It was either right when I started college or right at the end of high
[18:17.100 --> 18:19.780]  school and I got seven gram bags.
[18:20.100 --> 18:20.940]  Oh no.
[18:21.220 --> 18:26.260]  And like, as soon as it hit my hand, I was like, well, you just got demoted to
[18:26.260 --> 18:27.380]  dealer number three.
[18:27.700 --> 18:31.980]  Like you just went from slot one to slot three like that, buddy.
[18:31.980 --> 18:35.460]  Like now when I get back to the car, I've got to find something in my car to dump
[18:35.460 --> 18:38.180]  all this into so that it's all in one container.
[18:38.780 --> 18:43.460]  Like, and I mean, this was still in the days where having a scale to check to
[18:43.460 --> 18:48.500]  make sure you didn't get cheated was evidence of distribution as far as the
[18:48.500 --> 18:49.500]  courts were concerned.
[18:50.060 --> 18:54.020]  I mean, we've got to undo all of this and it's going to take a hell of a lot of
[18:54.020 --> 18:54.380]  time.
[18:55.180 --> 18:59.260]  There were problems when we had our medical marijuana cards here in Colorado,
[18:59.260 --> 19:02.580]  you would get pulled over and the cops would be like, you smell like marijuana.
[19:02.580 --> 19:03.660]  I'd be like, yeah, I'm not stoned.
[19:03.660 --> 19:04.660]  I smell like marijuana.
[19:04.940 --> 19:07.620]  They'd be like, well, I'm going to go through your car and you're like, oh, I
[19:07.620 --> 19:08.860]  have a medical marijuana card.
[19:08.860 --> 19:12.420]  So all my stuff is legal and they'd still steal your weed.
[19:12.460 --> 19:15.500]  They'd send you home with your pipe and whatever else you had, but they would
[19:15.500 --> 19:17.340]  take your marijuana from you.
[19:17.620 --> 19:19.300]  And sometimes you lose your pipe and shit too.
[19:19.540 --> 19:19.740]  Yeah.
[19:19.860 --> 19:20.820]  But they wouldn't arrest you.
[19:20.820 --> 19:23.060]  They wouldn't give you a ticket, but they just take all your shit.
[19:23.380 --> 19:26.980]  And it was because they simply didn't agree with the medical marijuana rules
[19:27.900 --> 19:29.380]  or didn't understand a lot of the time.
[19:29.380 --> 19:30.260]  Also, I guess.
[19:30.580 --> 19:36.060]  I mean, honestly, the way we did this in Colorado, when Colorado and Washington
[19:36.060 --> 19:40.060]  did it in before that, during the just medical days when there were no legal
[19:40.060 --> 19:46.820]  rec states yet, a lot of people, and I mean a lot, a lot of people just kept
[19:46.820 --> 19:53.780]  waiting for the federal government to wake up and go, no bad hippie, like in
[19:53.780 --> 19:57.740]  threaten the States with the one that everybody talked about was road funding,
[19:58.100 --> 20:02.180]  because that's how the feds got all the States to snap in a line with, um,
[20:02.300 --> 20:06.420]  alcohol drinking age and alcohol rules was to threaten, um, federal highway
[20:06.420 --> 20:07.020]  dollars.
[20:07.620 --> 20:12.940]  And I mean, places like California, that's why they're so fucked now is because
[20:12.980 --> 20:14.940]  they passed medical in 96.
[20:15.940 --> 20:26.060]  And so before 96, there was a thriving, very well run, well organized black
[20:26.060 --> 20:31.100]  market that spanned the whole state and supplied a huge portion of the country.
[20:31.740 --> 20:36.940]  With cannabis that was all operating out of California, Oregon, Washington
[20:36.940 --> 20:38.620]  state, golden triangle.
[20:38.980 --> 20:40.740]  You can look this shit up if you don't know what I'm talking about.
[20:40.740 --> 20:43.460]  Check out the North Cal humble golden triangle area.
[20:44.140 --> 20:45.820]  You can pull up the union.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.980]  It's a documentary on YouTube.
[20:47.980 --> 20:49.500]  It's more about BC.
[20:49.580 --> 20:49.740]  Yeah.
[20:49.740 --> 20:51.260]  That's a, and it's a couple of years.
[20:51.260 --> 20:55.260]  It's like eight years after the time period I'm talking about, but it'll break
[20:55.260 --> 20:58.140]  down what exists or break down for you.
[20:58.140 --> 21:02.300]  What existed before medical, if you're not familiar or if you're just
[21:02.300 --> 21:03.780]  interested, it's a fucking great watch.
[21:04.380 --> 21:11.460]  I kind of forgot about that one, but, uh, then medical hits in 96 and literally
[21:12.220 --> 21:20.220]  everyone in charge from the cop that just got out of cop school to the governor of
[21:20.220 --> 21:24.700]  the country or the governor of the state kept waiting for the feds to go knock it
[21:24.700 --> 21:28.220]  off, we're going to yank your highway funding, shut it all down tomorrow.
[21:28.860 --> 21:34.820]  And so the governor never told the legislature to hurry up and get on
[21:34.860 --> 21:40.740]  crafting rules, the legislature never told law enforcement to fucking look at what
[21:40.740 --> 21:45.580]  the law passed and learn what the medical rules said so that they could enforce them
[21:45.580 --> 21:46.340]  correctly.
[21:46.900 --> 21:51.020]  The chiefs of police never told their guys what the rules were to give a fuck
[21:51.060 --> 21:53.100]  because none of their bosses cared either.
[21:53.580 --> 21:59.780]  And so it was just left up to everybody to kind of guess and watching how that
[21:59.780 --> 22:05.420]  played out in Colorado, where we had a pretty solid entrenched black market
[22:05.420 --> 22:13.140]  before, um, medical hit in 2000, but nothing like California.
[22:13.180 --> 22:17.020]  We weren't supplying most of the United States from Colorado.
[22:17.660 --> 22:22.940]  Um, we did for a minute, but mostly just on paper in the press because that's
[22:22.940 --> 22:24.580]  where they focus their busts.
[22:25.140 --> 22:31.020]  Um, but California's problems way, way bigger.
[22:31.140 --> 22:36.660]  And it's mostly because it was ignored for longer, a lot longer.
[22:37.180 --> 22:41.580]  Um, we had solid rules on the books and a couple of revisions already before
[22:41.580 --> 22:45.300]  California legislatures got around to really trying to craft anything.
[22:45.380 --> 22:50.340]  There are completely operational dispensaries in California that do not have any
[22:50.340 --> 22:50.860]  paperwork.
[22:50.940 --> 22:53.380]  They don't have any of the state or county or city.
[22:53.500 --> 22:53.740]  Yeah.
[22:53.780 --> 22:56.180]  Well, no, they just, there are stores that just pop up.
[22:56.340 --> 23:00.500]  There's three out of every four is what the status in California right now.
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.420]  Three out of every four stores are entirely illegal, unlicensed.
[23:05.300 --> 23:12.700]  Um, and so some of them are doing the very best they can to follow
[23:12.700 --> 23:14.340]  what rules there are in their area.
[23:14.340 --> 23:20.220]  Their area just hasn't gotten around to finalizing it so that there isn't a
[23:20.340 --> 23:26.140]  two steps, one through seven type process to, to get licensed in other places.
[23:26.140 --> 23:27.140]  They've been banned.
[23:27.580 --> 23:32.500]  And so dispensary just pops up like mushrooms after a good rain, man.
[23:32.620 --> 23:32.820]  Yep.
[23:33.020 --> 23:36.180]  They just pops up and then they wait until they get rated and they take as many
[23:36.180 --> 23:37.820]  sales as they can until it's over.
[23:37.820 --> 23:40.380]  And then they just disappear and then they pop up somewhere else.
[23:40.420 --> 23:41.020]  When that's.
[23:41.420 --> 23:47.060]  Whenever I get in an argument about like us social policy, as far as cannabis goes,
[23:47.820 --> 23:52.620]  um, I try to bring up the size and scope of the black market as often as I possibly
[23:52.620 --> 23:52.980]  can.
[23:53.620 --> 23:55.300]  Um, like it's impossible.
[23:55.300 --> 24:02.180]  It's not like Pepsi where we can really gauge us sales accurately, but we've got
[24:02.180 --> 24:02.740]  good guest.
[24:03.700 --> 24:11.820]  And the guest amends are fucking insanely large, like 35 to $70 billion a year in
[24:11.820 --> 24:13.460]  us cannabis consumption.
[24:13.460 --> 24:15.260]  How much do you think of that as cop math?
[24:15.860 --> 24:20.500]  Um, it depends because these are DEA estimates.
[24:21.260 --> 24:33.660]  Um, they're really the only people that have a good guestimate of us drug activity,
[24:34.060 --> 24:38.460]  but we know for a fact that their view and their guest amends are really, really
[24:38.460 --> 24:39.020]  shitty.
[24:39.780 --> 24:45.140]  Um, you can go about doing the math a couple of different ways and take how many
[24:45.140 --> 24:50.260]  people per a hundred thousand or whatever consume cannabis, do the math for the
[24:50.260 --> 24:55.820]  whole population of the USA, and then do the math for the average marijuana
[24:55.820 --> 24:59.820]  consumer consumes blank amount of marijuana per blank amount of time.
[25:00.260 --> 25:03.060]  And marijuana costs blank amount of money per weight.
[25:03.780 --> 25:04.540]  Math with Mike.
[25:04.980 --> 25:08.700]  It works back to about 30 to $50 billion.
[25:09.540 --> 25:15.540]  Um, and just to put that in perspective, because numbers like that don't mean
[25:15.540 --> 25:17.180]  anything to regular humans.
[25:17.740 --> 25:23.300]  It's the size of the cosmetics industry in the U S so think about eyeliner,
[25:23.740 --> 25:29.420]  fingernail, clippers, shampoo, all that shit, lotion, all that shit, everywhere
[25:29.420 --> 25:36.100]  you go to see it, you see it at Walgreens, Walmart, Walgreens, the gas station.
[25:37.020 --> 25:37.780]  Everywhere.
[25:37.860 --> 25:42.060]  While all the, all the trucks it took to deliver it, all the companies it takes to
[25:42.060 --> 25:44.460]  make it, all the factories it takes to produce it.
[25:44.980 --> 25:50.900]  And the U S cannabis industry has been doing that until very, very recently in
[25:50.900 --> 25:58.260]  people's basements and backyards in national parks, space, basements in the
[25:58.260 --> 26:01.700]  Midwest, everywhere, outdoors and coast.
[26:02.700 --> 26:07.380]  And only very recently has any of this activity been legal.
[26:08.380 --> 26:13.820]  And so, I mean, people point it, the $7 billion that the U S cannabis
[26:13.900 --> 26:15.860]  industry did legally last year.
[26:16.420 --> 26:19.580]  And they're like, oh, it's going to balloon to 20 billion by 2020.
[26:19.580 --> 26:25.860]  And it's like, well, the industry as a whole is already been doing 35 billion
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.700]  or better since the late nineties.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.300]  That's a lot of money.
[26:29.420 --> 26:32.700]  When you try to grasp that amount of money, that's yeah, that's a number I
[26:32.700 --> 26:34.340]  can't even fathom when it comes to money.
[26:34.660 --> 26:41.180]  And the idea that we're going to let all of this just take place in the dark
[26:42.260 --> 26:49.260]  forever, because it feels good when you smoke it is fucking nuts.
[26:50.180 --> 26:56.100]  And getting all of that pulled out and straightened out and lined up like we do
[26:56.100 --> 27:00.740]  everything else is just going to take a long time, but we got to get after it.
[27:00.740 --> 27:04.340]  If we keep pussyfooting around and fucking around until it's perfect,
[27:04.340 --> 27:05.900]  it's never going to happen.
[27:06.100 --> 27:10.500]  Do you see and feel the improvements of this little dusty town because of cannabis?
[27:10.620 --> 27:10.860]  Yeah.
[27:11.260 --> 27:16.460]  Everybody 24 to 40 works in the marijuana industry if they choose to.
[27:16.460 --> 27:20.700]  It's pretty easy to go get a job as a trimmer, a cultivator, a bud tender, a
[27:20.860 --> 27:23.500]  driver, that all the packages have to get moved.
[27:23.820 --> 27:24.820]  It's not everybody.
[27:25.100 --> 27:31.020]  It's just our circle, but it's, I mean, honestly, it's like 1500 or 2000 people
[27:31.020 --> 27:37.300]  in a town of 130,000 and put literally just putting 2000 people back to work
[27:37.340 --> 27:40.500]  every day, that's 2000 people buying lunches.
[27:40.540 --> 27:42.340]  That's 2000 people paying rent.
[27:42.380 --> 27:44.220]  That's 2000 people buying groceries.
[27:44.220 --> 27:47.900]  And then also that brings the people that own the dispensary have to be here
[27:47.900 --> 27:48.660]  occasionally.
[27:48.700 --> 27:51.980]  If they live in an ivory tower, wherever those people live, they have to come here.
[27:51.980 --> 27:53.900]  The owners of the grow have to come here.
[27:54.300 --> 27:56.420]  Their consultant buddies have to come here.
[27:56.420 --> 27:57.940]  Their investor buddies come here.
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.180]  I've hotel rooms and better restaurants here.
[28:01.220 --> 28:02.940]  There are better restaurants is what I was getting.
[28:02.940 --> 28:06.020]  The food options here have exploded over the last five years.
[28:06.020 --> 28:08.220]  And it's, I blame it on the cannabis industry.
[28:08.980 --> 28:12.620]  Well, the, I mean, there's a lot going on in Colorado.
[28:12.620 --> 28:14.540]  It's not just the cannabis industry.
[28:14.540 --> 28:18.660]  That's really, um, pushing Colorado forward.
[28:18.700 --> 28:21.060]  The cannabis legal cannabis is a big part of it.
[28:21.060 --> 28:22.460]  It's not the only part of it though.
[28:23.100 --> 28:29.060]  Um, but if you're a tradesman, if you're an electrician or a plumber with a small
[28:29.060 --> 28:34.620]  business or that worked for a small business, literally in Southern Colorado,
[28:34.620 --> 28:40.980]  legal cannabis saved your business in 2008 and 2010, 2012 without legal cannabis,
[28:41.020 --> 28:42.380]  you don't have a business anymore.
[28:42.380 --> 28:45.700]  And also all those restaurants that open because we need lunch breaks.
[28:45.780 --> 28:47.220]  They're all hiring people as well.
[28:47.620 --> 28:47.820]  Yep.
[28:47.900 --> 28:50.380]  So it's, I mean, it's put so many people back to work.
[28:50.420 --> 28:51.900]  There are a lot of smoke shops.
[28:52.260 --> 28:57.100]  Um, bring in an underground business above board.
[28:57.860 --> 28:59.780]  There's, I mean, there's so much money.
[28:59.780 --> 29:01.980]  There's so much potential for investment.
[29:02.660 --> 29:11.060]  Um, and Colorado was rife with properties that needed a little bit of love,
[29:11.100 --> 29:15.540]  especially Southern Colorado, Pueblo and Trinidad, Walsenberg.
[29:16.100 --> 29:20.500]  We'd been, I mean, it's a slow death since the late fifties.
[29:21.140 --> 29:21.620]  Ish.
[29:22.300 --> 29:28.020]  Um, when mining and steel started to slowly take a downturn down here, um,
[29:29.500 --> 29:33.620]  it's like somebody standing on our throat and we needed something and cannabis brought
[29:33.620 --> 29:36.340]  all three of those cities back in a big way.
[29:36.740 --> 29:39.100]  Trinidad and Walsenberg are booming now.
[29:40.060 --> 29:40.340]  Boom.
[29:40.780 --> 29:44.820]  And that, remember we used to go there and we would notice that I think it was
[29:44.900 --> 29:48.020]  Trinidad, they're just when we pulled up, they would notice they'd be like, oh,
[29:48.580 --> 29:49.660]  those two guys are here.
[29:49.660 --> 29:51.620]  And they would know there's a different car in town.
[29:51.660 --> 29:52.780]  That's how small it used to be.
[29:52.780 --> 29:53.900]  Now it is thriving.
[29:53.980 --> 29:54.180]  Yep.
[29:54.500 --> 29:56.540]  Um, I w I want to say it was Trinidad.
[29:56.540 --> 30:00.620]  Their chief of police had a great interview in the paper a couple of years
[30:00.620 --> 30:06.180]  ago, it was a nice long article about how he went from, um, a detractor and a
[30:06.180 --> 30:13.300]  skeptic to an ardent supporter because he had seen, um, what the legal industry
[30:13.300 --> 30:14.980]  and the taxes had done for his town.
[30:15.540 --> 30:19.260]  And it, it wasn't one of those things where it's like, I'm willing to trade,
[30:19.260 --> 30:21.860]  you know, all the bad stuff for the money.
[30:22.460 --> 30:27.660]  It's there's very little bad stuff to be seen because it's just cannabis and
[30:27.660 --> 30:29.100]  it's not like it's mandatory.
[30:29.300 --> 30:29.580]  Right.
[30:29.740 --> 30:33.980]  And if you're not interested and you're not consuming, it's, it shouldn't affect
[30:33.980 --> 30:36.660]  the boss or even it's just like the NFL for me.
[30:36.660 --> 30:38.580]  Like I, I know it's a thing.
[30:38.820 --> 30:40.300]  I hear about it a lot.
[30:40.380 --> 30:41.900]  I hear people talk about it a lot.
[30:42.380 --> 30:44.660]  I don't know anything about it and I could give a fuck.
[30:45.380 --> 30:46.860]  It's the same way with cannabis.
[30:46.860 --> 30:47.540]  It's like golf.
[30:47.620 --> 30:47.900]  Yeah.
[30:47.980 --> 30:48.500]  It's like golf.
[30:48.540 --> 30:49.460]  That happens.
[30:49.580 --> 30:51.340]  I'm sure it's happening somewhere right now.
[30:51.340 --> 30:53.340]  And I drive by places where it happens.
[30:53.460 --> 30:54.180]  I'm cool with that.
[30:54.220 --> 30:54.460]  Do it.
[30:54.460 --> 30:57.020]  Sometimes I see people doing it and I don't understand it.
[30:57.060 --> 30:57.300]  Yeah.
[30:57.340 --> 30:57.940]  I don't want any.
[30:57.980 --> 30:58.420]  I'm cool.
[30:59.860 --> 31:00.060]  Yup.
[31:00.460 --> 31:05.340]  Uh, man, one thing I love is they banned advertising of cannabis businesses.
[31:05.340 --> 31:06.500]  You can't really advertise.
[31:06.500 --> 31:09.380]  You can't put a big sign up on the street, like come to my weed store.
[31:09.700 --> 31:12.460]  I love that the way around that is to adopt a highway.
[31:12.820 --> 31:15.100]  You can sponsor the highway cleanup program.
[31:15.100 --> 31:16.340]  That always makes me smile.
[31:16.380 --> 31:19.380]  This highway was cleaned up by Mike and Jeff's dispensary.
[31:19.460 --> 31:20.020]  I love that.
[31:20.180 --> 31:20.340]  Yup.
[31:20.420 --> 31:26.300]  The, it's one of the rules in Colorado that I really like because we learned our
[31:26.300 --> 31:28.780]  lesson with alcohol and tobacco advertising.
[31:29.340 --> 31:33.180]  Like there's, there's no reason for Joe Camel to exist.
[31:33.220 --> 31:35.300]  Like, let's just make that shit a part of the past.
[31:35.540 --> 31:36.380]  Yeah, we know.
[31:36.420 --> 31:38.580]  We don't need weed store cartoons.
[31:38.660 --> 31:40.420]  Like we can skip all that shit.
[31:40.580 --> 31:42.100]  I love some of the commercials though.
[31:42.140 --> 31:45.980]  The educational commercials like, and don't forget that you can't take your
[31:45.980 --> 31:48.340]  weed to the state park or the state fair.
[31:48.420 --> 31:48.700]  Yeah.
[31:48.700 --> 31:49.780]  They're all gentle about it.
[31:50.460 --> 31:54.900]  If the industry did some of the shit, our regulators pull or the anti-pop people
[31:54.900 --> 31:58.220]  pull the anti-pop people love putting edibles on billboards.
[31:58.700 --> 32:02.580]  If the company that makes the edible that the anti-pot companies used in their
[32:02.580 --> 32:09.980]  photo, put up a billboard that showed the fucking cookie, Oh, the M I M E D would
[32:09.980 --> 32:11.460]  break out the black helicopters.
[32:11.460 --> 32:13.100]  That's a, that's a wonderful point.
[32:13.100 --> 32:14.180]  I never saw that.
[32:14.220 --> 32:15.140]  I mean, never.
[32:15.380 --> 32:18.980]  You saw, yeah, there's a group smart Colorado that does every year.
[32:18.980 --> 32:21.900]  They do a billboard with a bunch of edibles and now they're edibles.
[32:21.900 --> 32:26.780]  You can't even get in Colorado anymore because shit like four, three or four
[32:26.780 --> 32:28.900]  years ago, we banned everything.
[32:28.900 --> 32:31.820]  That's not a geometric shape.
[32:31.940 --> 32:32.220]  Yeah.
[32:32.300 --> 32:34.020]  It can't look appealing anymore.
[32:34.020 --> 32:35.500]  If it looks good, you can't sell it.
[32:36.140 --> 32:37.340]  And not quite true.
[32:37.340 --> 32:40.260]  The gummies that look, look delicious, but shout out to Koda.
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.100]  It makes a very beautiful product.
[32:42.100 --> 32:42.420]  Still.
[32:42.420 --> 32:45.220]  It's got to be packaged up to where it doesn't appeal to children.
[32:45.340 --> 32:45.540]  Yeah.
[32:45.540 --> 32:46.940]  And I mean, that makes sense.
[32:46.980 --> 32:52.060]  It's you can just use plain words to tell us what's in the package in that way.
[32:52.060 --> 32:53.540]  My two year old doesn't try to eat it.
[32:54.420 --> 33:00.340]  Um, but, uh, smart Colorado is this giant billboard and slaps it up on I-25 every
[33:00.340 --> 33:04.580]  year, and I always chuckle when I see it because if any dispensary did it, or if
[33:04.580 --> 33:08.540]  any of the edible companies with products shown, did it, they would immediately be
[33:08.540 --> 33:09.940]  slapped with huge fines.
[33:09.940 --> 33:12.380]  The billboard would be down within a couple of hours.
[33:12.980 --> 33:17.460]  Um, and no, but because it's an anti-fog group that suckers up for months.
[33:17.460 --> 33:17.740]  Go ahead.
[33:17.740 --> 33:18.380]  Put it up there.
[33:18.420 --> 33:19.900]  Put it right up in the middle of Denver.
[33:19.900 --> 33:22.340]  So you can see it on I-25 all day, every day.
[33:23.220 --> 33:23.860]  That's amazing.
[33:23.900 --> 33:24.380]  I love it.
[33:24.980 --> 33:29.820]  A moment ago, Mike, you said that we had some of the wrong faces representing
[33:29.820 --> 33:33.820]  cannabis and that you wish some folks would disappear exactly who, no, that's
[33:33.820 --> 33:34.660]  not what I'm going to say.
[33:35.060 --> 33:36.420]  My question is the opposite.
[33:36.740 --> 33:41.740]  What would be more of an ideal, uh, face for cannabis?
[33:41.940 --> 33:45.740]  Who would you, if you were hiring, if you're like, all right, I run weed,
[33:45.740 --> 33:49.220]  weeds at business, and you're the fucking King and I'll be the King.
[33:49.220 --> 33:50.300]  You could be the vice president.
[33:50.300 --> 33:51.980]  I'm going to put you as the hiring manager.
[33:52.180 --> 33:56.140]  You're hiring me the VP of marketing and I've got to find us a new promo face.
[33:56.140 --> 33:56.300]  Yeah.
[33:56.300 --> 33:57.620]  Who are the faces of cannabis?
[33:57.620 --> 33:59.340]  It doesn't have to be anybody that we know.
[33:59.380 --> 34:03.260]  Fucking swimmer with the snaggle to you can make, Oh, the Olympic guy.
[34:03.260 --> 34:05.340]  I knew his name until you said his fucking name, dude.
[34:05.340 --> 34:08.580]  But, uh, yeah, the guy with the lungs that's got all the awards.
[34:08.700 --> 34:10.140]  He's my first call, Mr.
[34:10.140 --> 34:11.300]  17 gold medals.
[34:11.340 --> 34:11.700]  Okay.
[34:11.700 --> 34:12.380]  Everybody out there.
[34:12.380 --> 34:12.900]  Phelps.
[34:13.060 --> 34:14.420]  Uh, Michael Phelps.
[34:14.460 --> 34:16.580]  I was going to say the podcast, whoever just yelled that.
[34:16.860 --> 34:19.780]  If you yelled Michael Phelps into your, if you yelled Michael Phelps,
[34:19.860 --> 34:23.380]  motherfucker into your phone just now, I heard you and I said it out loud
[34:23.380 --> 34:25.180]  because of you, big shout out, big fist bump.
[34:25.180 --> 34:26.060]  I owe you a dab.
[34:26.500 --> 34:31.020]  Uh, so if you tweet me, Michael Phelps right now, not if Michael Phelps tweets
[34:31.020 --> 34:35.100]  me listeners, if you tweet me just the tweet that says, Hey, at Nemo pump 50,
[34:35.100 --> 34:36.340]  the answer was Michael Phelps.
[34:36.340 --> 34:36.940]  He's stoner.
[34:37.420 --> 34:41.300]  I might, I probably won't, but I might send you a sticker or two.
[34:41.500 --> 34:42.820]  Follow them back at least.
[34:42.860 --> 34:43.100]  Yeah.
[34:43.180 --> 34:44.020]  And at least a follow back.
[34:44.020 --> 34:47.460]  If Michael Phelps tweets it, either one of us, I will for sure send you a
[34:47.460 --> 34:47.860]  sticker.
[34:47.860 --> 34:48.140]  Yeah.
[34:48.260 --> 34:49.220]  Yeah, for sure.
[34:49.380 --> 34:50.540]  I'll find you an Irish shirt.
[34:50.540 --> 34:53.060]  If it's really Michael Phelps, I want to see that blue check Mark though.
[34:53.460 --> 34:53.740]  Yeah.
[34:53.740 --> 34:54.900]  You got to be verified, bro.
[34:55.380 --> 34:57.620]  Um, now I'm not trying to be rude about it.
[34:57.620 --> 34:58.980]  You just, I know what you're saying.
[34:58.980 --> 35:02.260]  I completely understand that you don't want the tie dye shirt guy with the
[35:02.620 --> 35:05.780]  pimples who hasn't taken a shower and he's got the headband and those hippie
[35:05.780 --> 35:07.780]  glasses, legalize weed, bro.
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.980]  That was, that was perfect for a minute.
[35:10.340 --> 35:11.540]  Peace and love legalized.
[35:11.540 --> 35:13.300]  We'd we've kind of gotten there now.
[35:13.300 --> 35:16.780]  It's fucking like let out all the fucking people who committed a little weed
[35:16.780 --> 35:17.660]  crime out of jail.
[35:17.660 --> 35:18.620]  We're at a better point.
[35:18.620 --> 35:20.460]  We need to be better presented.
[35:20.580 --> 35:22.020]  So that's why I'm asking this.
[35:22.020 --> 35:23.380]  I just want to know who you would sign up.
[35:23.380 --> 35:28.580]  We've, we've got a lot of people that, I mean, a lot of the original figureheads
[35:28.580 --> 35:34.900]  still seem to be fighting for my, my favorite grower can grow weed in their
[35:34.900 --> 35:37.060]  basement and sell it on Facebook.
[35:38.020 --> 35:39.540]  And it's like, I get it.
[35:39.660 --> 35:40.980]  I really, really do.
[35:41.700 --> 35:46.900]  Um, it's never going to be as legal as we want it to be.
[35:46.900 --> 35:47.940]  Not in our lifetime.
[35:47.940 --> 35:48.660]  Not like that.
[35:49.500 --> 35:55.500]  Um, and I get all the arguments and I'm behind it and then I'm with you and it
[35:55.500 --> 35:57.660]  should be, but it's just not.
[35:57.660 --> 36:03.100]  And because we're not being rational and reasonable about it, like government is
[36:03.100 --> 36:04.140]  all about compromise.
[36:04.140 --> 36:06.100]  Society's all about compromise.
[36:06.140 --> 36:10.820]  And that's what makes America great is because you get to do you and I get to do
[36:10.820 --> 36:11.180]  me.
[36:11.660 --> 36:16.340]  And as long as one of us ain't stomping on the other, we're good.
[36:17.020 --> 36:21.380]  It's not until we go crashing into each other that we got problems.
[36:22.220 --> 36:29.580]  And if we could just chill out and focus on upfront, starting the conversation with
[36:30.100 --> 36:33.780]  this is going to be a compromise when we're done and we shake hands and we're
[36:33.780 --> 36:37.860]  finished with this, everybody's going to have a little bit of a bad taste in their
[36:37.860 --> 36:39.700]  mouth on one point or another.
[36:40.220 --> 36:41.580]  That's just how it goes.
[36:42.100 --> 36:44.100]  Like that's what compromise is.
[36:44.140 --> 36:46.980]  It's it's never, it's all my way and fuck you.
[36:47.420 --> 36:48.900]  That's not how government works.
[36:48.940 --> 36:51.380]  We're not, we don't have Kings and dictators here.
[36:51.420 --> 36:52.340]  It doesn't work that way.
[36:52.340 --> 36:54.700]  I just made you king of cannabis Island a moment ago.
[36:54.740 --> 36:58.020]  I know, but like it, Michael Phelps and call me back, bro.
[36:58.060 --> 36:59.340]  He like, he's got enough money.
[36:59.620 --> 37:01.620]  It's going to swim around our Island and laugh at us.
[37:02.180 --> 37:13.180]  Um, but, uh, I'm, it just drives me nuts when I see these figureheads that I've,
[37:13.260 --> 37:15.700]  I've loved and I've supported for 20 years.
[37:16.460 --> 37:22.860]  Um, all of a sudden they're anchors instead of battering Rams and it's,
[37:23.860 --> 37:26.700]  it's just unfortunate guys out there.
[37:26.700 --> 37:30.980]  What you can take from that is be a fucking battering Ram for the legalization
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.740]  and the movement for cannabis.
[37:32.780 --> 37:33.900]  Don't be an anchor.
[37:34.180 --> 37:36.340]  I love you that you're out there supporting cannabis.
[37:36.660 --> 37:41.180]  Uh, I wrote down a few things that I thought would be an ideal cannabis
[37:41.220 --> 37:43.180]  spokesperson or advocate.
[37:43.500 --> 37:47.340]  And this is, uh, this is very general, but these are things that I think you'll
[37:47.340 --> 37:49.220]  agree with, Mike, we need somebody that's addressed.
[37:49.460 --> 37:53.100]  I don't need you in a bathing suit and I don't need you in your sixties hippie
[37:53.100 --> 37:55.940]  costume, but be yourself, uh, present yourself.
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.980]  Well, we need people to take you seriously.
[37:58.220 --> 37:59.460]  I can't talk too much shit.
[37:59.660 --> 38:01.180]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[38:01.380 --> 38:02.820]  I'm not trying to be this person.
[38:02.860 --> 38:04.180]  I'm doing my part right here.
[38:04.420 --> 38:07.020]  I'm inventing our hypothetical favorite cannabis person.
[38:07.380 --> 38:07.700]  Uh,
[38:07.900 --> 38:09.740]  they're dreadlocks really kill you.
[38:09.820 --> 38:16.340]  There's a beautiful research researcher with like a million PhDs who's got dreads,
[38:16.340 --> 38:16.660]  dr.
[38:16.660 --> 38:17.260]  Carl Hart.
[38:17.300 --> 38:22.900]  And every time he gives a speech, like 80% of the responses, they'd be fucking
[38:22.900 --> 38:23.700]  dreads.
[38:24.980 --> 38:27.780]  And it's like, dude, he's been to the best schools.
[38:27.780 --> 38:29.180]  He's got the degrees.
[38:29.180 --> 38:31.300]  He really knows he's doing the research.
[38:31.300 --> 38:35.340]  He's in the lab offering crack to crack addicts and being like, here's crack or a
[38:35.340 --> 38:37.780]  five, make it a smart choice.
[38:37.780 --> 38:39.820]  And the guy's like, I'll take five bucks and go get a cheeseburger.
[38:39.820 --> 38:40.620]  Like, thanks.
[38:41.300 --> 38:45.140]  Like he's doing the fucking research and people still won't listen to him just
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.100]  because he's got dreads.
[38:46.180 --> 38:47.340]  But that's who I am.
[38:47.340 --> 38:48.180]  And it's what I love.
[38:48.540 --> 38:50.940]  No, it works very well for what I'm doing.
[38:50.940 --> 38:52.180]  Fighting for your right to wear them.
[38:52.220 --> 38:52.780]  Thank you, bro.
[38:52.820 --> 38:53.500]  I appreciate that.
[38:53.500 --> 38:54.860]  Rastafari, big respect.
[38:54.860 --> 38:55.740]  But, uh,
[38:55.740 --> 38:58.780]  like high five realizing that it's a detractor.
[38:58.860 --> 39:03.100]  I represent I read genetics, which having dreadlocks works beautifully for that.
[39:03.260 --> 39:05.500]  Uh, I represent the grow from your heart podcast.
[39:05.540 --> 39:07.060]  I can do that very well with dreadlocks.
[39:07.060 --> 39:10.660]  You guys, if you're surprised by any of this conversation right now, I am six foot
[39:10.660 --> 39:10.980]  five.
[39:10.980 --> 39:13.540]  I weigh about 190, maybe 210 pounds.
[39:13.540 --> 39:17.380]  I fluctuate summer, winter time, one 92, 10 ish, six, five, 200 pounds.
[39:17.740 --> 39:23.260]  Uh, I've got dreadlocks that are thick and crazy and they go to my knees.
[39:23.260 --> 39:25.900]  A lot of people are often surprised when they discover the dreadlocks.
[39:26.100 --> 39:28.740]  And if you've met me and they were tied up and you went, how fucking long are
[39:28.740 --> 39:28.980]  those?
[39:29.180 --> 39:30.300]  They go to the knees.
[39:30.300 --> 39:32.780]  It's straight up carrying like nine Afghans behind his head.
[39:32.780 --> 39:32.860]  Yeah.
[39:32.860 --> 39:34.980]  There's a lot of hair going on here, but I take care of it.
[39:34.980 --> 39:35.740]  It's very, uh,
[39:36.940 --> 39:38.900]  geez, it's very well, geez, come on, Mike.
[39:38.900 --> 39:39.860]  You made that awkward.
[39:40.140 --> 39:41.020]  Uh, it's very well kept.
[39:41.020 --> 39:43.860]  I think for the most part, I got a lovely friend who takes good care of my
[39:43.860 --> 39:45.140]  dreadlocks when she's available.
[39:45.380 --> 39:46.660]  Uh, she is pregnant at the time.
[39:46.660 --> 39:47.900]  I don't know if I'm supposed to say that.
[39:47.900 --> 39:48.060]  Yeah.
[39:48.060 --> 39:49.780]  It's a baby showers in a few days.
[39:49.780 --> 39:50.460]  She's legit.
[39:50.820 --> 39:54.220]  Uh, she takes great care of my dreads when she's not super pregnant, but right
[39:54.220 --> 39:56.740]  now she is as pregnant as I think a person should get.
[39:57.060 --> 39:57.860]  Uh, where am I?
[39:58.140 --> 40:01.940]  Uh, so people are quite often taken by surprise by my appearance.
[40:02.140 --> 40:05.580]  I think I represent the plant and myself very well, but if we're going to build
[40:05.740 --> 40:08.620]  our favorite cannabis advocate, they'd be well dressed.
[40:08.620 --> 40:11.380]  You're not the guy to pick to convince Republicans to vote for.
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.860]  And it's not what I'm trying to do, bro.
[40:12.860 --> 40:15.700]  I'm trying to, I speak well, and I've got the show, then the audience that I'm
[40:15.700 --> 40:18.100]  trying to reach for the right job.
[40:18.100 --> 40:19.420]  And you're the wrong tool for that job.
[40:19.420 --> 40:22.700]  We need a male or a female that is properly dressed.
[40:22.700 --> 40:26.420]  I know I'm trying to skip over you calling me a tool, a person properly
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.300]  dressed, not a bikini, not a suit.
[40:28.460 --> 40:28.660]  Yeah.
[40:29.180 --> 40:32.940]  He's got to go to, and if you could drop, drop that stick at the trade shows,
[40:32.940 --> 40:33.620]  that'd be pleasant.
[40:33.740 --> 40:33.900]  Yeah.
[40:33.900 --> 40:36.340]  We don't need the bikini clad stuff in the industry.
[40:36.380 --> 40:37.660]  That's that's the beer industry.
[40:37.660 --> 40:38.380]  Keep it over there.
[40:38.420 --> 40:41.300]  Can drive across the street to the titty bar after the trade show.
[40:41.580 --> 40:43.180]  Also some hygiene.
[40:43.380 --> 40:47.980]  A lot of people nowadays, I'm a dreadlock white guy and I smell good, bro.
[40:48.180 --> 40:48.980]  I don't stink.
[40:48.980 --> 40:49.940]  You don't smell my dreads.
[40:49.940 --> 40:50.860]  You don't smell my pits.
[40:50.860 --> 40:51.780]  You don't smell my feet.
[40:51.780 --> 40:52.700]  You gotta be all right.
[40:52.740 --> 40:53.500]  Be presentable.
[40:53.860 --> 40:57.260]  Then here is stuff that really, I think we need somebody that can speak well.
[40:57.580 --> 41:01.500]  Somebody that can form and compose a proper paragraph.
[41:01.580 --> 41:05.220]  Somebody that can go in front of a podium and talk to, I want somebody
[41:05.220 --> 41:06.660]  that can convince my grandma.
[41:06.660 --> 41:07.180]  I love you, grandma.
[41:07.180 --> 41:10.260]  She's gone now, but somebody that would be able to convince my grandma that
[41:10.420 --> 41:13.740]  cannabis THC and or CBD would be perfect for her.
[41:13.940 --> 41:15.660]  There's no reason to convince my gramps.
[41:15.660 --> 41:19.020]  He already knew, but somebody that could talk to the old folks, somebody that
[41:19.020 --> 41:22.780]  can talk to the reggae fans, somebody that can talk to the juggalos, somebody
[41:22.780 --> 41:26.140]  that can talk to my accountant, somebody that can talk to the lawyers, somebody
[41:26.140 --> 41:30.180]  that can speak to everybody, like they're all equal and they can all understand
[41:30.180 --> 41:33.700]  your words that you use and the way that you use them at somebody that I
[41:33.700 --> 41:35.140]  would like to see represent us.
[41:36.660 --> 41:36.980]  Yeah.
[41:37.060 --> 41:38.540]  I'd be all for that.
[41:38.540 --> 41:41.780]  And honestly, like a lot of the people that have been representing the
[41:41.780 --> 41:46.260]  community for years and decades do a wonderful job and have done a wonderful
[41:46.260 --> 41:51.180]  job, but there's, I see something at least once a day where I just face palm.
[41:52.020 --> 41:54.540]  Um, we're really on the cusp.
[41:55.380 --> 41:56.460]  The last thing I'll go ahead.
[41:56.460 --> 42:02.460]  My politics is nuts right now and it's going to get cookier, but basically
[42:02.540 --> 42:09.220]  every, um, every, every democratic politician runner right now is, is not
[42:09.220 --> 42:14.860]  just pro legalization, but they're one upping each other with, I'm going to
[42:14.860 --> 42:15.580]  legalize it.
[42:15.580 --> 42:17.380]  No, I'm going to legalize it on day one.
[42:17.380 --> 42:19.900]  No, I'm a legalized during my transition motherfucker.
[42:20.340 --> 42:23.100]  And it's, it's silly because they can't do any of that.
[42:23.620 --> 42:31.740]  But the fact that they're saying it is a monumental change over just the last
[42:31.740 --> 42:38.700]  election when it was Hillary Trump, neither of them were vocally discussing
[42:38.700 --> 42:39.380]  what he was saying.
[42:39.380 --> 42:40.380]  Those two names together.
[42:40.380 --> 42:42.900]  I pictured one giant beast that had United.
[42:42.900 --> 42:45.700]  I was like, the white, the white, what did I miss the Hillary Trump?
[42:45.900 --> 42:46.540]  That's fucking.
[42:46.540 --> 42:47.940]  That's whoa.
[42:48.420 --> 42:52.780]  That was just four years ago and eight years, eight years ago.
[42:53.860 --> 42:58.580]  It was something that people like me were talking about during the election cycle,
[42:58.580 --> 43:01.540]  but it was not something that candidates were talking about during the election
[43:01.540 --> 43:02.020]  cycle.
[43:02.300 --> 43:05.140]  Obama only ever brought it up when he was fucking forced to.
[43:06.060 --> 43:11.700]  Um, I remember the, there was the big pitch that he did where they were going
[43:11.700 --> 43:16.460]  to put together a website that was fully open and free form and people could,
[43:16.460 --> 43:18.980]  could submit questions and vote on questions.
[43:19.380 --> 43:21.260]  And then the president was really going to answer them.
[43:21.700 --> 43:25.220]  And when they announced that they were going to do this, the whole country went,
[43:26.300 --> 43:27.300]  presidents don't do that.
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.460]  The white house doesn't do that.
[43:28.780 --> 43:35.100]  Like the, the chosen reporter press pool, they get to ask questions and sometimes
[43:35.980 --> 43:37.780]  the powers of the beach used to answer them.
[43:38.220 --> 43:41.140]  Never did they fucking take questions from the peanut gallery.
[43:41.140 --> 43:42.980]  Certainly not the fucking internet.
[43:43.580 --> 43:44.660]  And they really did it.
[43:45.220 --> 43:51.140]  And of course, marijuana was the top question by miles.
[43:51.940 --> 43:54.420]  And the answer was, ha ha, fuck off hippies.
[43:56.140 --> 44:01.300]  We, we, we got that far in that we got slapped that hard by someone we all
[44:01.300 --> 44:02.620]  thought was going to be supported.
[44:03.820 --> 44:10.100]  And now we literally have the whole field just openly discussing not just cannabis
[44:10.140 --> 44:14.180]  legalization, but psychedelics and other drug decriminalization, like
[44:14.220 --> 44:16.100]  major drug policy reform.
[44:17.060 --> 44:25.100]  And still we can't get a common sense, marijuana legalization step forward in a
[44:25.100 --> 44:27.100]  place like New York, which is blue as fuck.
[44:27.980 --> 44:31.780]  Like it don't get much bluer New York as far as politics goes.
[44:32.300 --> 44:36.460]  And cannabis legalization has been a democratic issue for 20 years now.
[44:37.020 --> 44:41.940]  And still zero movement in the legislature states, the states that have
[44:41.940 --> 44:48.260]  legalization and good medical rules are almost all passed by a public vote in a
[44:48.260 --> 44:53.300]  place where the public can force stuff on ballots in places like New York, where it
[44:53.300 --> 44:54.860]  has to go through the legislature.
[44:55.780 --> 44:59.180]  Y'all really need to wrangle your politicians and get their feet to the fire.
[44:59.820 --> 45:05.580]  So the white mic 2028, maybe, maybe I like that.
[45:05.900 --> 45:10.740]  The one last thing I want from my cannabis representative, my Mount Cushmore, the
[45:10.740 --> 45:14.900]  king of Mount Cushmore, I guess we're going to call it is no fucking sponsors, no
[45:14.900 --> 45:17.060]  political interests, no brands.
[45:17.060 --> 45:18.260]  I don't care if it's green dot.
[45:18.260 --> 45:21.660]  I don't care if it's the grow from your heart podcast or I read genetics, no
[45:21.660 --> 45:24.020]  sponsors, but they've got to be on their own independent thing.
[45:24.020 --> 45:25.140]  They've got to be established.
[45:25.140 --> 45:28.140]  And I made a lot of enemies fighting for everybody.
[45:28.220 --> 45:30.060]  I'll give you, I'll tell you that right now.
[45:30.660 --> 45:35.500]  There are a lot of people who do not like me down here that, that own chunks of the
[45:35.500 --> 45:40.100]  industry because I fought for the people growing in their basements and the people
[45:40.100 --> 45:46.180]  growing in fucking acreage, um, at the same time and the people growing in acreage
[45:46.180 --> 45:46.940]  didn't like that.
[45:47.460 --> 45:52.940]  And the fucking people growing in their basements, they liked it, but they
[45:52.940 --> 45:54.900]  minimized all of that really quickly.
[45:54.980 --> 45:55.260]  Yup.
[45:55.460 --> 45:55.780]  Yeah.
[45:56.380 --> 45:57.260]  You got to do what you got to do.
[45:57.260 --> 45:59.580]  You got to learn how to work with what you're working with.
[45:59.820 --> 46:00.100]  Yeah.
[46:00.260 --> 46:00.500]  Yeah.
[46:00.980 --> 46:03.020]  That's not hard to do once you learn how to adjust.
[46:03.140 --> 46:05.060]  It's all about being a weird show, but I liked it.
[46:05.180 --> 46:08.540]  Let's uh, I'm going to go play like half of this and that fuzzy navel.
[46:08.860 --> 46:08.980]  Yeah.
[46:08.980 --> 46:10.420]  You went off for a little bit there, Mike.
[46:10.420 --> 46:11.060]  I appreciate it.
[46:11.060 --> 46:12.460]  I want to go on my time.
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.940]  I'm just starting to come back to reality a little bit.
[46:14.940 --> 46:16.140]  That dad took me places.
[46:16.220 --> 46:16.340]  Yeah.
[46:16.340 --> 46:17.700]  It took the whole audience places.
[46:17.700 --> 46:20.620]  I sat back for 10 or so minutes and just let you go, bro.
[46:20.620 --> 46:21.980]  I was not going to interrupt any of that.
[46:21.980 --> 46:22.700]  It was magical.
[46:22.940 --> 46:26.660]  At Nemo punk 15, you know, uh, and just so that you know, since you asked how long,
[46:26.660 --> 46:31.100]  it's been 46 and a half minutes and I'm going to cut probably one minute out of that.
[46:31.420 --> 46:31.660]  Good.
[46:31.900 --> 46:32.100]  Yeah.
[46:32.140 --> 46:32.740]  That's about it.
[46:32.820 --> 46:35.140]  So it, uh, I hope y'all liked it.
[46:35.620 --> 46:36.300]  We enjoyed it.
[46:36.620 --> 46:38.100]  I was part of the audience this time.
[46:38.100 --> 46:40.740]  I sat back and tried to listen instead of talking too much.
[46:40.740 --> 46:42.140]  I nodded just to keep you going.
[46:42.380 --> 46:43.140]  And I think it worked well.
[46:43.140 --> 46:44.140]  Mike, you did a good job.
[46:45.580 --> 46:47.740]  Um, I don't know.
[46:47.740 --> 46:53.580]  I would, I would love to see like sometime 2021, cause it would take us a minute to
[46:53.580 --> 46:54.220]  organize.
[46:54.660 --> 46:57.220]  I would love to see us do like a million stone or March.
[46:57.220 --> 47:01.660]  I think I've mentioned that on the show before where we picked a weekend that
[47:01.660 --> 47:06.740]  wasn't fucking four 20 and we all went to DC and just blazed down in DC.
[47:07.100 --> 47:08.300]  It gets legal there.
[47:09.100 --> 47:14.340]  And because Congress controls their budget, they haven't been able to implement
[47:14.340 --> 47:14.660]  the law.
[47:14.660 --> 47:15.780]  Their voters pass.
[47:16.580 --> 47:20.580]  It's just one of those really fucked up American rules where the city of DC gets
[47:20.580 --> 47:22.420]  royally screwed by Congress.
[47:23.100 --> 47:25.340]  And right now they're holding back legalization.
[47:25.340 --> 47:29.860]  So being able to go there and do a major demonstration would be fun.
[47:30.300 --> 47:35.340]  Um, I know that's totally in contrary to a lot of what I just said.
[47:35.460 --> 47:41.300]  If anybody out there in Twitter world can go, uh, contact Mike and let Mike help
[47:41.300 --> 47:44.900]  Mike organize a million marijuana March.
[47:44.900 --> 47:45.700]  Is that already taken?
[47:45.700 --> 47:46.900]  Or is that something we can use?
[47:46.980 --> 47:50.780]  Like if 6 million people want to confirm on the internet that they're going to go,
[47:50.780 --> 47:52.860]  I bet we could get a full on million there on the day.
[47:52.980 --> 47:55.780]  It's like area 51, but let's get the million marijuana.
[47:55.780 --> 47:57.740]  We're not there to clap you in butt cheeks though.
[47:57.740 --> 47:59.820]  We know we can fucking roll blunts together.
[47:59.820 --> 48:00.940]  We know we can do that.
[48:00.980 --> 48:01.740]  That's the truth.
[48:01.820 --> 48:05.860]  Million marijuana March sponsored by white Mike and the grow from your heart
[48:05.860 --> 48:07.700]  podcast. I don't really want to sponsor that.
[48:07.700 --> 48:10.140]  We'll just let Mike organize it, but we need organizers.
[48:10.140 --> 48:11.620]  We need people to help us put that together.
[48:11.820 --> 48:14.380]  Well, Mike, I don't, have you ever been there to DC?
[48:14.420 --> 48:14.620]  Yeah.
[48:15.500 --> 48:17.220]  He's got, he doesn't know what he's doing.
[48:17.220 --> 48:18.340]  He just looked up into space.
[48:18.500 --> 48:19.380]  He definitely needs help.
[48:19.380 --> 48:19.660]  You guys.
[48:19.660 --> 48:22.180]  I was trying to remember the age and I honestly don't think I was 12.
[48:22.260 --> 48:23.580]  Somebody tweeted, make it happen.
[48:23.580 --> 48:24.980]  If you guys make it happen, I'll go.
[48:25.060 --> 48:26.020]  You're like, you make it happen.
[48:26.020 --> 48:26.540]  I'll show up.
[48:26.580 --> 48:27.420]  That's all I'm going to promise.
[48:27.460 --> 48:30.260]  I'm not going to be involved in the making of, but I'll be there.
[48:30.300 --> 48:31.060]  Yeah. Let's do this.
[48:31.060 --> 48:34.660]  Million marijuana March in Washington, 2000.
[48:34.740 --> 48:36.020]  And it's something that honestly,
[48:36.020 --> 48:37.900]  politicians really respond to that shit.
[48:37.900 --> 48:40.260]  If you get a big enough, it can't be like,
[48:41.300 --> 48:42.620]  cause the abortion people do it.
[48:42.620 --> 48:43.780]  They do it for an afternoon.
[48:43.780 --> 48:45.220]  They marched down the street, they go away.
[48:45.940 --> 48:49.060]  Um, they do some of that every now and then you,
[48:49.060 --> 48:52.660]  you really need like more than a million people and you really got to roll
[48:52.660 --> 48:54.580]  through a city for like a long weekend.
[48:55.060 --> 48:57.660]  But if you do that, you scare the hell out of the people,
[48:57.700 --> 49:00.020]  the powers that be, cause that's like,
[49:00.020 --> 49:03.180]  we're supposed to all be too pacified to show up and mass.
[49:03.620 --> 49:06.420]  Cause there's really nothing you can do about a group that big.
[49:07.140 --> 49:10.060]  That was sort of the point of the big demonstrations originally, you know?
[49:10.380 --> 49:13.220]  Yeah. Makes complete sense. Power in numbers. Scare them.
[49:13.300 --> 49:17.540]  When a herd runs at you, like your options are get out of the way or get trampled.
[49:17.620 --> 49:20.740]  Join that motherfucking herd. Yep. That's your options.
[49:20.980 --> 49:23.140]  I, the last note that I wrote down, Mike, that we should talk about,
[49:23.460 --> 49:25.060]  I just says stupid shit.
[49:25.100 --> 49:29.260]  And one of the stupidest shits that I think is some States are afraid to
[49:29.260 --> 49:34.260]  legalize cannabis because the stupid law enforcement can't tell the difference
[49:34.460 --> 49:37.580]  between cannabis and hemp. What's CBD and what's THC?
[49:37.580 --> 49:41.940]  Oh, it's one of my favorite stories of the year, bro. Um,
[49:44.100 --> 49:48.940]  so most of the arguments against legalization are just
[49:48.940 --> 49:51.580]  bad on face value. Um,
[49:51.900 --> 49:56.140]  like a middle school debate team could rip the fuck out of the best pro
[49:56.140 --> 50:00.940]  visionists in the country right now, just on base merits for an argument.
[50:01.660 --> 50:06.660]  But one of the ones you see all the time is that modern pots way stronger than
[50:06.940 --> 50:09.580]  it used to be. This isn't your grandfather's weed.
[50:10.060 --> 50:13.860]  And if you go back to the eighties and the seventies,
[50:13.940 --> 50:17.700]  every time the politicians and the DEA have said that and add them all up,
[50:17.860 --> 50:21.260]  you're talking about weed.
[50:21.260 --> 50:24.020]  That's like five and 6,000% THC,
[50:24.460 --> 50:27.340]  which if you're not retarded,
[50:27.980 --> 50:30.420]  you know that you can't have something that's more than a hundred percent of
[50:30.420 --> 50:34.540]  anything. If anybody's got those seeds, I'll take them. Um, yeah, it's,
[50:35.820 --> 50:39.460]  uh, you see anti-pop people talking about 70% THC edibles.
[50:40.020 --> 50:41.300]  And it's like, you think we've,
[50:41.300 --> 50:46.300]  we're eating gummy bears that are 70% hash and 30% gummy bears.
[50:47.900 --> 50:51.060]  It would just be 70. It would just be the THC, the molecule,
[50:51.140 --> 50:52.820]  you think a gummy bear around it.
[50:53.700 --> 50:57.740]  Yeah. A seventh of a gram of this delicious hash.
[50:57.740 --> 51:01.460]  And I mushed a third of a gram of gummy bear on it and I ate it.
[51:02.180 --> 51:04.780]  Like do you even fucking hear the words that are coming out of your mouth?
[51:05.780 --> 51:08.700]  And then when the story broke,
[51:11.140 --> 51:15.780]  when was it? I want to say like November,
[51:16.340 --> 51:20.780]  but it could have been August. It might not have been till January. Um,
[51:20.820 --> 51:25.820]  Texas was the big one where law enforcement groups across the state came out
[51:26.700 --> 51:29.380]  together and said, because of the,
[51:29.540 --> 51:32.940]  the federal hemp bill making hemp, um,
[51:32.980 --> 51:37.980]  or cannabis sativa with less than 0.03% THC in it per volume is now legal.
[51:41.140 --> 51:45.660]  We, they have no way to tell if you've got a quarter of,
[51:46.300 --> 51:48.380]  like fire nugs in your pocket,
[51:48.820 --> 51:52.980]  or if you've got a quarter of ditch weed in your pocket, the cops can't tell.
[51:53.580 --> 51:58.020]  They can smell it and they can call it green leaf and material and they can send
[51:58.040 --> 52:02.220]  it to a lab who after several months will send a report back to the cops that
[52:02.220 --> 52:07.060]  says yes is weed or no is not weed.
[52:07.540 --> 52:11.620]  That's the report they get back because that's the only testing equipment they've
[52:11.620 --> 52:12.940]  ever bothered to buy.
[52:13.420 --> 52:15.900]  And so not only does it give lie to the,
[52:16.260 --> 52:21.260]  this weeds way stronger than last week's weed because they never fucking tested
[52:22.380 --> 52:25.140]  to see how strong it was. They never bothered.
[52:25.740 --> 52:29.580]  They just heard Dr. Dre was dropping a new album called the chronic and that
[52:29.600 --> 52:33.980]  must mean it's super strong weed now and it's dangerous. It's hydro. Yep.
[52:34.700 --> 52:38.380]  The new cook it's, we could play this game all night. What,
[52:38.460 --> 52:42.140]  whatever new slang term that we threw on top of the product,
[52:42.140 --> 52:44.660]  it became like the fucking anti-pop.
[52:44.660 --> 52:49.500]  People really think girl scout cookies tastes like girl scout cookies because we
[52:49.940 --> 52:54.940]  added chemical agent flavoring to the plant or manipulated its genetics to make
[52:55.660 --> 52:59.140]  it taste like peppermint. Like they're insane.
[53:00.220 --> 53:02.500]  And you see stories like this,
[53:02.520 --> 53:05.420]  the cops can't really test the potency of your cannabis.
[53:05.860 --> 53:10.500]  And so they have no idea if that's a tractor trailer full of hemp or a tractor
[53:10.500 --> 53:15.220]  trailer full of Colombian bud. Like it's just not,
[53:15.780 --> 53:20.180]  it's ridiculous that they can rely on that archaic testing to put people in
[53:20.180 --> 53:21.020]  jail.
[53:22.140 --> 53:25.220]  It's just, it's absolutely insane. And it's,
[53:27.220 --> 53:32.220]  it's seeing them admit it now is just really aggravating because that whole,
[53:33.580 --> 53:37.540]  this weeds a lot stronger than it used to be bullshit. I mean,
[53:37.540 --> 53:42.540]  that's like their favorite card in the deck right now.
[53:43.820 --> 53:46.980]  Um, there's a couple of different groups around the country that are trying to
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  get bills passed in legal marijuana states that limit potency to like 10 or 15
[53:54.580 --> 53:57.980]  percent in flower and concentrates.
[53:59.180 --> 54:00.780]  And it's like,
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.620]  we just had a bunch of vaping deaths that looked like they're either tied to an
[54:05.620 --> 54:10.620]  additive in the hash or something in the pan that's being used to heat the hash
[54:11.700 --> 54:12.520]  up.
[54:12.520 --> 54:16.500]  So it's either a contaminant or a consumption method problem,
[54:16.520 --> 54:20.220]  not a THC problem. And their answer,
[54:20.420 --> 54:24.740]  their new idea is to dilute that shit further with more cutting edge.
[54:24.780 --> 54:28.100]  As a medical marijuana consumer,
[54:28.620 --> 54:33.620]  I like the concentrates with 70 to 80% THC because I can take one fat inhale
[54:35.980 --> 54:40.500]  and one good exhale and I've consumed the amount of medicine I need for an hour,
[54:40.500 --> 54:42.420]  maybe an hour and a half fish. And I'm good.
[54:43.100 --> 54:46.140]  If that were 10% THC,
[54:46.300 --> 54:47.780]  you know you're talking about three joints,
[54:48.340 --> 54:51.420]  seven dabs. Yeah. Like if you're going to cut it, if you're going to make,
[54:51.420 --> 54:54.300]  this is a 70% concentrate. What's the stay on the back 63.
[54:54.540 --> 54:57.260]  I'd take six dabs if this were 10% concentrated,
[54:57.260 --> 55:00.460]  take six dabs to get to the same spot. I'm a medical patient.
[55:00.700 --> 55:03.060]  My lungs don't need six dabs going through them.
[55:03.060 --> 55:06.700]  That's like part of the reason why I moved on to concentrates less in an exhale.
[55:07.100 --> 55:08.500]  Like, so if I'm a sick person,
[55:08.500 --> 55:11.260]  like if I was actually older and in worse health,
[55:11.260 --> 55:14.500]  I wouldn't want to have to take six dabs. I want one to get my medicine.
[55:14.500 --> 55:17.620]  So that's just a, and I'm going to take six. Like if I have to,
[55:17.740 --> 55:19.420]  if I'm only getting 10, I'm going to do it.
[55:19.700 --> 55:22.700]  There's not a logical reason that they're doing this. It's,
[55:22.740 --> 55:26.380]  it's all designed to cripple the industry. That's their only goal.
[55:27.780 --> 55:28.860]  Ignorance and fear.
[55:29.180 --> 55:30.820]  I say it all the time. There's, there's a,
[55:30.900 --> 55:35.900]  seriously, a huge group of people in this country that they grew up really buying
[55:37.980 --> 55:42.980]  into the drugs are bad. Drug users are bad people.
[55:43.220 --> 55:46.660]  They have poor morals. They have low character.
[55:47.340 --> 55:52.340]  And the way that you show other people in your society that you were a high or a
[55:54.380 --> 55:57.620]  person with good morals and strong, um,
[55:58.020 --> 56:00.820]  strong values, strong values and character.
[56:03.820 --> 56:07.500]  You don't do drugs and you hate drug users and you talk shit about them.
[56:07.620 --> 56:11.340]  And that's like half the fucking country.
[56:12.060 --> 56:17.060]  And they look at the other half of the country pushing for legalization,
[56:17.340 --> 56:19.300]  talking about harm reduction.
[56:19.300 --> 56:22.780]  And they don't understand any of this that
[56:23.780 --> 56:27.580]  they just, they can't wrap their heads around it.
[56:28.140 --> 56:28.980]  They,
[56:28.980 --> 56:33.980]  they really are convinced that if we let marijuana be legal,
[56:34.780 --> 56:37.460]  we're going to make it mandatory for middle schoolers.
[56:38.980 --> 56:41.300]  Like it's just nuts.
[56:41.980 --> 56:46.980]  And they go so far is to like deny the existence of the black market altogether.
[56:47.820 --> 56:50.940]  It's you talk to the local anti-pop people like smart Colorado,
[56:51.380 --> 56:55.220]  they're a well-known group. They're quoted by the press every week.
[56:55.780 --> 56:59.900]  They're reported on nationally. They're, they've got a, uh,
[57:00.460 --> 57:04.980]  a THC cap potency bill that's going to work its way through the legislature and
[57:04.980 --> 57:07.740]  get killed early in Colorado. But, uh,
[57:07.780 --> 57:10.260]  they're inspiring the same moves in other States.
[57:10.260 --> 57:13.380]  They're pushing States that are urging the league or looking like they're going
[57:13.380 --> 57:16.260]  to legalize to add rules like that at the jump.
[57:16.820 --> 57:21.820]  So that like if Kentucky really does pass the medical marijuana stuff that
[57:21.820 --> 57:23.460]  they're talking about, um,
[57:23.500 --> 57:28.500]  the anti-pop people are pushing it to include shit like a 10% THC cap and
[57:28.500 --> 57:31.340]  concentrates and a ban on edibles and, you know,
[57:31.340 --> 57:36.340]  all the sort of nightmare rules that we would just not at all except here,
[57:36.820 --> 57:40.340]  but they're thinking they can sneak them in up front there. Um,
[57:40.420 --> 57:44.940]  and they're getting away with it because a bunch of the country just doesn't
[57:44.940 --> 57:45.780]  care enough to fight.
[57:46.700 --> 57:49.820]  You're going to say that they, they believe something that's completely ludicrous.
[57:49.820 --> 57:51.500]  I lost the train of your thought also, Mike,
[57:51.740 --> 57:54.740]  I try to keep up with you guys. I've been ran for too long. It's late.
[57:54.900 --> 57:58.060]  It is late. This is actually the third podcast I've done today.
[57:58.060 --> 58:01.220]  I did another episode of my own and then I was on the embracing organic show for
[58:01.220 --> 58:03.420]  over two hours. So let's start wrapping this up.
[58:03.420 --> 58:06.340]  It's 1230 right now. I'm past my dadly bedtime.
[58:06.340 --> 58:08.740]  Mike's train of thought has left the fucking station.
[58:08.780 --> 58:13.780]  The story Jeff brought up is the THC potency thing is,
[58:13.780 --> 58:14.980]  is a really good story.
[58:14.980 --> 58:19.500]  And I keep coming back to it because it's one of those fun stories where it
[58:19.500 --> 58:23.740]  gives away to a lie that authority figures have been telling for decades and not
[58:23.740 --> 58:25.980]  just one, but several. Um,
[58:26.820 --> 58:29.820]  but not enough people pay attention to all the moving parts to follow it.
[58:30.020 --> 58:33.820]  There's so many smoke and mirror tricks happening now that it's hard to keep up
[58:33.820 --> 58:35.340]  with every and anything.
[58:35.340 --> 58:39.940]  You see law enforcement officials in the same, the same article bitching about
[58:39.940 --> 58:43.420]  how they can't test for the difference between half and marijuana and then
[58:43.420 --> 58:47.260]  insisting that they can't legalize because today's marijuana is so much more
[58:47.260 --> 58:50.340]  potent than it used to be. Like, it's just a joke.
[58:51.020 --> 58:52.700]  Which machine did you not use, sir?
[58:52.940 --> 58:56.820]  Well, they're, what they're doing is they're comparing. Um, so what the,
[58:57.660 --> 59:00.940]  what local police departments would do if they felt like it,
[59:01.540 --> 59:06.460]  what local police departments would do if they felt like it is they could send
[59:06.460 --> 59:11.460]  portions of a seizure to the DEA lab and the DEA
[59:12.260 --> 59:13.980]  lab can test for potency.
[59:14.700 --> 59:19.020]  But the way that works is like I get pulled over on January 1st.
[59:19.500 --> 59:21.540]  The cops says, I smell marijuana.
[59:21.900 --> 59:26.540]  We go through that whole rigmarole and my bag of weed ends up in evidence.
[59:27.260 --> 59:31.020]  Six months, eight months, 20 months later, I go through court,
[59:32.140 --> 59:37.140]  um, and a gram of that gets sent off maybe two months before the trial date,
[59:37.340 --> 59:42.340]  three months before the trial date gets sent off to the DEA lab and comes back
[59:43.260 --> 59:48.260]  with a, it's 12% THC or it's 4% THC or whatever. Um,
[59:48.420 --> 59:52.260]  because by then it's been sitting in evidence and God only knows what condition
[59:52.300 --> 59:56.740]  it's in for. God only knows how long. And it's rotted, molded,
[59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.180]  been crushed. THC degrades over time.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.260]  Decarboxylated. Yeah. Who knows what happened to that THC in there?
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.500]  It might've been warm, might've been cold. Could've been humid.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.780]  Could've been dry. Is it under a bright light? Is it in front of a window?
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:10.780]  Was it sealed? Was it open? Yeah. So many variables.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:14.020]  Is it in a paper bag, a plastic bag? Um,
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.380]  and so the DEA has been testing years,
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:24.380]  months old products and then calling that what people are consuming and
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.300]  pretending that's a legit number. And in the further you go back in time,
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.660]  the weaker the numbers get and the slower that process gets is like all of a
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.300]  sudden somebody in East Brownsville,
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.300]  Texas that does a big pop bust and sends a couple of grams off to the DEA lab at
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.460]  the end of the bus, just to, you know,
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.500]  for record keeping because they don't do anything with that.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:51.500]  The charge isn't stronger or a higher degree felony if it's stronger weed.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.460]  None of that shit matters. It's just, and not really,
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.540]  it's just the weight. Um,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.020]  all the charges are based on the poundage or the ounces,
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.180]  depending on what drug you're talking about. But, uh,
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.180]  Mike's losing his train of thought. He's high as shit over here.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.300]  And it's high and I'm tired guys. I'm sorry.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.860]  Close to one o'clock. Mike, let's just wrap it up.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.660]  So you'll quit teasing everybody with more trains of thoughts that get lost and
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.380]  that they don't leave the station completely.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.140]  The trains have to make it to the second station or people are missing bro.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.780]  Um, so they send the shit off to the DEA lab slow.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.500]  It just takes a lot of time.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:33.020]  And they're comparing that number with what's on weed maps is the local
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.300]  dispensaries menu. Oh shit. Okay. Those are the two numbers that you're using.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.020]  So something you grew versus something I grew.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.980]  Yeah. Because it wasn't until,
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:46.820]  it wasn't until the legal modern cannabis industry that a majority of the
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.140]  product that people were actually consuming was getting lab tested. Fuck.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.220]  It took me a long to get there, but I got there folks.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.900]  All right. Let's give Mike a prize. You get another dab.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.820]  He looked at my rig. Like I'm not sure I fucking want to do that. All right.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.260]  Mike, dude, thank you for coming. It's late night.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.300]  You've been here for quite a while.

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.900]  I just can't believe you did all that smooth after I stumbled like that. Fuck,
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.620]  bro. Best of all, no script. If you look over here, no, no, no script.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.900]  I straight up feel like I've been trying to jog with no legs right now, dude.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.700]  That was so well done. Not to just clap. Thank you, brother. Thank you much.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.740]  That's a professional dabber and a professional podcast.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.740]  There's no script nailed that dude. Yeah.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.100]  My eyes were closed the entire time.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.980]  If that was like watching fucking Cleetus drive the forklift, dude,
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.860]  just fucking right at home and your best skills. Thank you, Brian.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.100]  Appreciate that. Um, shout out to Mike for coming. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:09.820]  thank you for joining me.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.860]  I'll be back in just a few days with fresh new content.

[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.940]  give me a follow on the Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.540]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Dick goals. And until next time,
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.140]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.900]  I'm going to take me to the start coming through the window tearing me apart.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.500]  Feel it in a nightmare. Always in a rain,
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.580]  see it in the memory coming back again.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:21.580]  And I always say only thing that ever made sense is when I can feel it.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.500]  The only thing that ever made sense is just to carry and can see it all.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.500]  Just know that I tried my best and the only way that I knew how
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:39.500]  I'm still doing it now.
[01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:13.990]  Stage now put us in a light, make it feel real and make it feel right.
[01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.430]  Floated down a concrete flying in the sky.
[01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:20.710]  I think we found a bloodstream of our life.
[01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:23.910]  Baby in the party car, put me in the mix,
[01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.990]  make it like you used to make it all fit.
[01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:30.230]  A real and messy old days covered in light.
[01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:33.350]  Wanna feel closer or wanna feel alive.
[01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:38.350]  And I always try. Only thing that ever made sense is when I can feel it.
[01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:44.070]  The only thing that ever made sense is just to carry and can see it all.
[01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:52.790]  Just know that I tried my best and the only way that I knew how
[01:06:55.270 --> 01:07:00.270]  and I'm still doing it now.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.900]  Doing it now.
