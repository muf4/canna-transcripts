[00:17.530 --> 00:19.890]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.890 --> 00:22.850]  It's time for episode number one 40 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:23.250 --> 00:27.210]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.210 --> 00:29.050]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.330 --> 00:31.250]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.370 --> 00:34.010]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.010 --> 00:37.410]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.530 --> 00:40.210]  I'm your host. My friends call me Ross DeGeffo.
[00:40.210 --> 00:42.570]  And I thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:42.570 --> 00:45.130]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for
[00:45.130 --> 00:46.930]  letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:46.930 --> 00:50.810]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:52.690 --> 00:56.970]  You guys right across the table from me mimicking the intro,
[00:57.490 --> 01:00.050]  miming it at me is my friend, Lindsey, the traveling stoner.
[01:00.050 --> 01:04.330]  Welcome to the show, hon. Hi, hi, hi. You had it word for word. Yeah.
[01:04.330 --> 01:06.530]  I told you one day I'm going to do it. You could do it.
[01:06.690 --> 01:09.090]  You want to try it right now? You want me to start over? We can hit rewind.
[01:09.090 --> 01:13.050]  We can go back. I told you, you're never going to see it coming.
[01:13.210 --> 01:15.770]  It's just going to push me to like, it's like a ninja dab.
[01:16.090 --> 01:19.170]  Push me to the side and take over for sure. Yeah. Well, you remember,
[01:19.170 --> 01:20.770]  you remember what happened to Clint when he did that?
[01:22.770 --> 01:25.210]  That other voice you hear jiggling over there, that handsome voice,
[01:25.450 --> 01:27.930]  that's Dudley voice. That's our buddy. White Mike. Welcome back to the show,
[01:27.930 --> 01:31.570]  brother. Thanks man. Lindsey, we apologize for not having you last time.
[01:31.770 --> 01:35.050]  Oh, it was a boys club. I don't mind. I don't mind that.
[01:40.250 --> 01:43.650]  Gosh. Yeah. Shout out to Lindsey. She brought a bunch of live resin.
[01:44.050 --> 01:46.170]  I was going to give her a shout out and I got all choked up about it.
[01:46.170 --> 01:50.050]  Maybe because she made me take a gigantic, ridiculous glob of some live resin.
[01:50.410 --> 01:53.490]  Thank you. It was amazing. But Holy crap. What are you trying to do to me?
[01:54.490 --> 01:55.330]  I don't know.
[01:55.330 --> 01:59.050]  I've had a little bit of a head cold or a sinus infection or some stupid shit
[01:59.050 --> 02:01.370]  slowing me down for a couple of days. I'm fighting it off.
[02:01.890 --> 02:05.450]  I've been trying to take small dabs over here for a change and take good care of
[02:05.450 --> 02:07.770]  myself. I've been taking a vitamin supplement,
[02:07.970 --> 02:09.730]  drinking double the water and shit.
[02:09.730 --> 02:11.970]  And this girl shows up and globs me the fuck out.
[02:12.410 --> 02:14.970]  I saw her hand it over and thought, Oh, it's going to be one of those shows.
[02:16.530 --> 02:18.970]  I haven't seen you in a couple of days. So to be honest,
[02:18.970 --> 02:20.730]  I didn't know you were taking baby dabs.
[02:20.730 --> 02:22.250]  I appreciate it. Thank you for, no, you made me,
[02:22.250 --> 02:26.170]  I said you didn't have to take it all. Then did I, I did it.
[02:26.330 --> 02:27.930]  I would have split it with you or something.
[02:28.010 --> 02:31.210]  I stepped up to the plate and I needed it and I feel better for having done it.
[02:31.770 --> 02:36.170]  Well, I'm glad I feel like a, a, a true, a true cannabis. Uh, I don't know,
[02:36.170 --> 02:39.650]  whatever. I'm dedicated as fuck. That's what I'm trying to say. I did it.
[02:39.650 --> 02:43.170]  I'm a terp kid turped out. You guys, thanks for joining me. I'm super high.
[02:43.170 --> 02:44.890]  Thanks for coming over tonight. Absolutely.
[02:44.930 --> 02:47.210]  I think this podcast might've been doing this tonight.
[02:47.210 --> 02:50.170]  Might've been Mike's idea. Mike might've accidentally scheduled this for us.
[02:50.330 --> 02:53.930]  Yeah. Sometimes a plan just comes together. I like it when it works.
[02:54.250 --> 02:56.610]  So a couple of nights ago I was chilling out. Oh, really quickly.
[02:56.610 --> 02:58.050]  Shout out to my friends at elevate glass,
[02:58.090 --> 03:01.330]  a five 17 South Tejon and Colorado Springs, Colorado. You guys,
[03:01.330 --> 03:04.930]  if you need a smoking accessories of any sort, uh,
[03:04.970 --> 03:06.970]  everybody in this room has been there. I think Mike's been there.
[03:07.010 --> 03:09.730]  Did I take you with me? Not yet. I don't think I've been to LA.
[03:09.730 --> 03:12.890]  I just lied to our listeners. I apologize for misleading you. Uh,
[03:12.890 --> 03:16.090]  Mike will be at elevate very soon. Uh, but Lindsay's been there.
[03:16.970 --> 03:20.410]  Very affordable, high quality glass and super lovely ladies.
[03:21.090 --> 03:21.970]  For sure. Super.
[03:21.970 --> 03:25.730]  There's a reason that the listeners don't know about my awesome rig and it's
[03:25.730 --> 03:26.770]  cause it don't exist yet.
[03:27.410 --> 03:29.090]  Well then we got to take you to elevate one day.
[03:29.210 --> 03:31.810]  I throw all my money at my kid right now, but uh,
[03:32.810 --> 03:34.570]  I've got a little stash going and uh,
[03:34.570 --> 03:36.730]  it's only a matter of time before I'm up to getting something nice.
[03:36.770 --> 03:40.010]  They've got something affordable for you. Uh, this one is 200 bucks.
[03:40.050 --> 03:42.610]  The banger is only 20 bucks. Nice. Talk to him, tell him,
[03:42.610 --> 03:44.850]  you listen to the podcast. They might make something happen for you.
[03:44.890 --> 03:47.170]  Stuff like that. You know, affordable rigs are awesome rigs.
[03:47.170 --> 03:49.970]  So shout out to my friends at elevate glass. Big shout out to everybody over
[03:49.970 --> 03:53.450]  there. Absolutely. Big hugs, fist bumps all around. Uh,
[03:53.490 --> 03:56.450]  five 17 South Tejon support that. You can get a carb cap and you get a banger.
[03:56.450 --> 03:59.730]  You can get a new rig and get a recycler. You can get a case for your rig.
[03:59.730 --> 04:01.650]  You can get some stickers. You can get some heady jewelry,
[04:02.170 --> 04:03.290]  all kinds of good shit in there.
[04:04.850 --> 04:08.010]  It's got everything. Let's get to the point of the show. You guys. Um,
[04:08.090 --> 04:10.690]  I don't even know where this idea came from. I sent Mike a text message.
[04:10.690 --> 04:13.690]  I said, Hey dude, let's do a podcast about dispensary etiquette.
[04:13.970 --> 04:18.770]  Mike is a bud tender at a recreational dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[04:19.130 --> 04:22.930]  Uh, anybody 21 and over is allowed to shop in that dispensary. Uh,
[04:22.930 --> 04:27.730]  if you've got a, an ID, excuse me, an ID, a passport, uh,
[04:27.770 --> 04:31.370]  what else works? Valid U S I issued ID. Okay.
[04:31.570 --> 04:33.290]  That says you're 21 and over. Yep.
[04:33.410 --> 04:36.290]  Then you're able to go in there and buy an ounce of cannabis. Yep.
[04:36.450 --> 04:38.890]  An ounce for anyone now. Nice. Uh,
[04:38.890 --> 04:43.810]  and Lindsey works in a medical cannabis facility in Colorado Springs.
[04:43.810 --> 04:47.170]  Colorado Springs does not support any recreational cannabis.
[04:47.170 --> 04:49.530]  They only have medical, so you can only shop medically.
[04:49.850 --> 04:53.210]  You have to have your purple card. Uh, yeah, it sounds so weird.
[04:53.210 --> 04:55.130]  It used to be a red card, but now you have to have your purple card.
[04:55.650 --> 04:59.210]  So they've both got very similar experiences yet.
[04:59.210 --> 05:02.210]  Very different experiences as bud tenders. Uh,
[05:02.210 --> 05:04.770]  Lindsey is the dreadlocked bud tender at green and healthy wellness.
[05:04.770 --> 05:06.530]  So when you're there, give her a shout out, say what's up,
[05:06.530 --> 05:08.850]  let her know that you heard about her on the podcast. Give her a fist bump.
[05:09.210 --> 05:10.570]  If she's super busy, just say, Hey,
[05:10.610 --> 05:12.250]  I listened to you on the podcast and let her move on.
[05:12.410 --> 05:14.810]  Cause she's got shit to do, but she's not busy. Uh,
[05:14.850 --> 05:17.450]  make sure you say hi to her support your bud tenders.
[05:17.450 --> 05:20.730]  And Mike is a butt tender in Pueblo West. If you see him tending bud for you,
[05:21.130 --> 05:23.530]  uh, give him a fist bump. Tell him I heard about you on the podcast.
[05:23.690 --> 05:24.650]  Yeah. Say hi folks.
[05:24.810 --> 05:28.650]  Mike was my bud tender at the spot. Yep. That on my birthday,
[05:28.650 --> 05:31.970]  my one and only time I've ever gone into the spot and bought something.
[05:31.970 --> 05:36.170]  Mike was my bud tender. Nice. Yep. See that could be you people.
[05:36.290 --> 05:39.330]  See, that's funny. Was he nice to you? Yeah, he was.
[05:39.370 --> 05:42.210]  He actually gave me a free t-shirt for my birthday. Birthday shirt.
[05:42.250 --> 05:44.650]  Was he informative? Yeah, absolutely. Did he,
[05:44.770 --> 05:47.890]  would you go back based on your experience with him? Oh my God.
[05:49.210 --> 05:50.330]  You're so silly.
[05:53.330 --> 05:54.730]  I didn't know a performance review.
[05:55.090 --> 05:59.890]  That's why I was like, what are you coming in? You come in all the time.
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.290]  So I was like, Oh Jesus.
[06:01.330 --> 06:03.570]  No, you're all will be. Yeah, but you're wonderful to me. We're friends.
[06:03.570 --> 06:06.170]  I don't come in and annoy you. I'm not like, can I smell this jar?
[06:06.170 --> 06:08.530]  Can I smell this jar? Can I smell this start? Yeah, I don't have any money.
[06:08.530 --> 06:10.610]  I just wanted to smell jars. I'm out. I'm not that guy.
[06:11.370 --> 06:15.090]  So is that the first one on the list? Because that's a great way to start.
[06:15.090 --> 06:16.250]  Do some introduction. We're going to talk.
[06:16.290 --> 06:18.730]  I don't think I even talked about what the, did your headphones get out?
[06:18.770 --> 06:21.290]  I see pointing at your ear. I'll just keep tapping until they come back in.
[06:21.410 --> 06:24.570]  Any better? No, no, no minor cut. Now what the fuck?
[06:26.810 --> 06:30.570]  Right about here. Okay. Then this one is Lindsay. Yeah.
[06:30.610 --> 06:33.530]  Is this working? Yeah. All right. I'll just quit touching it. We're good.
[06:33.570 --> 06:36.810]  All right. Okay. Sorry. Listeners. This piece of gear.
[06:38.930 --> 06:42.610]  Fading in and out right to left now. Really bro? What you did to me, bro.
[06:42.610 --> 06:47.530]  But I was perfect till that happened. How about this? We good.
[06:47.530 --> 06:49.890]  There we go. Headphone check. All right. Sorry, listeners.
[06:49.890 --> 06:51.450]  I hope your headphones are working as well.
[06:53.050 --> 06:54.170]  We might be able to edit.
[06:54.770 --> 06:56.650]  Then probably not. Sorry folks.
[06:57.890 --> 06:59.210]  That little box is evil.
[06:59.410 --> 07:01.210]  This will go live to drive.
[07:01.370 --> 07:04.050]  So we're going to do a podcast that is about dispensary etiquette,
[07:04.170 --> 07:07.850]  how a dispensary shopper should conduct themselves properly to not make
[07:07.850 --> 07:11.450]  themselves look like an asshole and not to annoy the fuck out of the dispensary
[07:11.450 --> 07:15.610]  workers. Uh, so both my friends work in dispensaries.
[07:15.610 --> 07:19.490]  I've got a lot of dispensary work. I was the, the fucking person.
[07:19.530 --> 07:21.610]  I did basically everything right.
[07:21.930 --> 07:25.010]  You've got plenty of bud tending experience as well. Yeah. I grew the weed.
[07:25.010 --> 07:27.570]  I bud tended for a long time. I opened and closed the shop.
[07:27.570 --> 07:30.410]  I did the bank deposits. So I've got a lot of dispensary experience.
[07:30.410 --> 07:34.010]  We started doing this back when we're like bud tending was being invented.
[07:34.010 --> 07:36.610]  Like what that looked like. We sort of created,
[07:36.610 --> 07:39.450]  there was no marijuana enforcement division tracking system.
[07:39.450 --> 07:42.730]  There was no regulation. There was no proper zoning.
[07:42.730 --> 07:43.730]  There was none of that shit,
[07:43.730 --> 07:47.170]  which is why we don't have a shop now because we kind of made all the rules.
[07:47.170 --> 07:51.450]  They decided let's make rules that pushes them out is what made all the rules
[07:51.450 --> 07:54.130]  for our community here. That's how the rules were made. Yeah.
[07:54.130 --> 07:57.410]  That was a piece of it for sure. Whatever fucks them. That's the new rule.
[07:57.490 --> 07:58.490]  That's how they worked on it.
[07:58.730 --> 08:01.610]  So we're going to talk a little bit how to conduct yourself like a proper
[08:01.610 --> 08:05.170]  gentleman or gentle woman in a dispensary. Since all of my friends work here.
[08:05.730 --> 08:06.570]  And uh,
[08:07.490 --> 08:11.730]  the tips are going to be a little bit like everybody and then kind of pro level
[08:11.730 --> 08:14.770]  because we have a rec shop and a medical shop.
[08:15.130 --> 08:18.330]  The expectations are going to be a little bit different. Um,
[08:18.330 --> 08:21.730]  in those two different marketplaces, but that's because one's medical,
[08:21.730 --> 08:23.970]  one's one's rec. Uh, one,
[08:24.010 --> 08:28.570]  one customer type is just anybody walking in, um, off the street or, uh,
[08:29.130 --> 08:32.410]  that drove here from a neighboring state to check it out for the first time.
[08:32.410 --> 08:36.330]  And the other has like joined a state program and should know, um,
[08:36.450 --> 08:40.730]  considerably more about the product and the selection and whatnot when they walk
[08:40.730 --> 08:41.570]  in.
[08:41.570 --> 08:43.490]  Like how you said should know, should, should.
[08:43.890 --> 08:47.410]  But also the first couple of times may require much more guidance.
[08:47.450 --> 08:48.370]  Right. The first couple of,
[08:48.770 --> 08:52.410]  one of the things I really wanted to stress for this show is questions are
[08:52.410 --> 08:55.370]  totally appropriate. Um, there,
[08:55.850 --> 08:58.930]  that might not be appropriate in that moment. Um,
[08:58.930 --> 09:03.090]  I had a guy recently that asked me, is this a good time to ask a lot of questions?
[09:03.090 --> 09:07.930]  I noticed you guys are usually busy. It's slow now. Um,
[09:07.970 --> 09:11.410]  and I said, sure, dude, it's dead right now. I have fire away. Um,
[09:11.410 --> 09:14.730]  and it turns out this guy had been shopping with us for like six or seven
[09:14.730 --> 09:18.330]  weeks. Like he was enough that I knew his face and kind of knew what his order
[09:18.330 --> 09:19.970]  was going to be. Um,
[09:20.010 --> 09:23.850]  but he really had no clue what he was doing was total marijuana novice and
[09:23.850 --> 09:28.410]  needed everything kind of broken down for him, all the lingo, um,
[09:28.410 --> 09:31.050]  all the different products. He'd just been coming in, buying a joint,
[09:31.050 --> 09:32.690]  taking it home, unrolling it,
[09:33.050 --> 09:36.210]  and smoking a little bit of it in the tiny cheap ass glass pipe.
[09:36.210 --> 09:38.610]  We sold him his first time in, um,
[09:39.210 --> 09:42.690]  and since then I've kind of set him up and shown him the ropes and got him
[09:42.690 --> 09:46.490]  going, but like, he just waited for the right time to ask questions. Um,
[09:46.530 --> 09:49.850]  people should be free to ask those questions, come in and do it.
[09:49.850 --> 09:53.930]  But if there's a long ass line and it's a hundred degrees outside and everybody
[09:53.930 --> 09:57.770]  in the lobby is impatient, don't smile at me big and go, it's my first time.
[09:57.770 --> 10:01.250]  Tell me about everything in depth. I want to know everything. Um,
[10:01.290 --> 10:03.130]  and then listen to the answers to the questions.
[10:03.130 --> 10:05.570]  Cause if you ask me for a third time in under five minutes,
[10:05.570 --> 10:09.290]  it's going to be hard not to be, um, I don't know,
[10:09.530 --> 10:14.450]  disappointed in you as a customer. Sorry. Did I just go off on a little rant?
[10:14.490 --> 10:18.890]  We like it. We love it when you ramble. It's perfect. All right.
[10:19.090 --> 10:21.690]  Do you guys for dishing out the dabs? This is partially on you.
[10:22.490 --> 10:25.130]  Be aware is what I took from that. Just be aware of if,
[10:25.290 --> 10:26.610]  if there's a time and place for everything,
[10:26.610 --> 10:29.770]  is this the time and place to ask a million questions or are there a hundred
[10:29.770 --> 10:33.690]  people in line? Yes, we would love to treat every patient, every customer,
[10:34.210 --> 10:36.810]  so since it's not, this is an odd question since it's not medical,
[10:36.810 --> 10:40.530]  what do you call the people at customer? They're just custies now. Okay.
[10:40.730 --> 10:44.490]  So we try it. We would try to treat every customer, every patient as,
[10:44.930 --> 10:46.930]  as their, it's their first time and they're golden.
[10:46.930 --> 10:49.810]  But sometimes we have a line to move and there are people that are just getting
[10:49.810 --> 10:53.170]  pissed in the dispensaries have to stop taking orders at a certain time.
[10:53.530 --> 10:55.090]  And if they don't have everybody out of there,
[10:55.090 --> 10:57.970]  they'll get fined in the last shoppers in the place can't get rung up.
[10:58.250 --> 11:02.210]  So sometimes it is a rush to get through the crowd because not so much at the
[11:02.210 --> 11:03.090]  medical dispensaries,
[11:03.090 --> 11:06.210]  but the recreational dispensary that Mike represents, they're busy.
[11:06.210 --> 11:09.650]  Sometimes there is a line and they got to rush through to get everybody out
[11:09.650 --> 11:13.970]  there. I don't know. We're kind of small. So sometimes like when we, I mean,
[11:13.970 --> 11:18.250]  you can't have more than one person to one,
[11:18.410 --> 11:21.090]  but like one group of, if you're all together,
[11:21.130 --> 11:23.730]  like there's two or three of you to one bud tender.
[11:24.130 --> 11:29.130]  So like I can't have a lot of people in the bud tending room while it's just
[11:29.210 --> 11:32.770]  me. If like someone comes in with their friend,
[11:32.790 --> 11:36.210]  I can take both of them back and be back there by myself.
[11:36.610 --> 11:40.730]  But if anyone else comes back as a patient, then another bud tender,
[11:40.730 --> 11:44.090]  someone, another employee needs to come out on the floor. Okay.
[11:44.290 --> 11:47.010]  So it does actually,
[11:47.010 --> 11:50.250]  it can get kind of busy over at green and healthy just depending on like what
[11:50.250 --> 11:52.410]  happens. But that's because we're super tiny.
[11:52.530 --> 11:56.090]  And the whole place is super tiny. There's usually two bud tenders there.
[11:56.250 --> 11:59.570]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We had Joe, well, he had three in there today.
[11:59.570 --> 12:02.290]  And I was like, Ooh, thank God. Cause it got kind of like crazy at one point.
[12:02.290 --> 12:02.930]  And I was like, yes.
[12:02.930 --> 12:05.890]  Shout out to Hunt for covering shifts for sure. I don't know if you,
[12:05.930 --> 12:07.490]  I don't think you listened to the show, bro, but either way,
[12:07.490 --> 12:08.330]  Hunt's getting a shout out.
[12:08.330 --> 12:11.450]  He's covering shifts at the grow and at the store and it's fucking rad.
[12:11.450 --> 12:12.410]  Good work brother. Thank you.
[12:12.410 --> 12:15.610]  We appreciate having a boss that's willing to grab the fucking broom and sweep
[12:15.610 --> 12:18.770]  up when we need that shit done. He's not above any job, which is pretty cool.
[12:18.970 --> 12:23.490]  I love it. Yeah, that's dope. Um, so yeah, be aware if it's not the right time.
[12:23.650 --> 12:25.330]  Yeah. Don't go asking a bunch of questions,
[12:25.450 --> 12:28.530]  sneak a couple of questions in there as shit's happening while the bud tender is
[12:28.530 --> 12:30.810]  weighing stuff, throw out some questions.
[12:30.850 --> 12:33.650]  First like what the one golden question that you really need answered.
[12:33.650 --> 12:35.730]  Try to throw that out. Like, yeah.
[12:35.930 --> 12:38.530]  And there might be a manager that could help you if you really have some
[12:38.530 --> 12:41.650]  questions. There's quite often a manager that needs something to do.
[12:41.810 --> 12:43.810]  And that's his job is to feel that type of shit.
[12:43.850 --> 12:47.450]  So find a manager and the bud tender may be happy to point you to one that may
[12:47.450 --> 12:50.130]  be your new strategy, bros. Terry can answer that or whoever the fuck is.
[12:51.090 --> 12:53.250]  I think I think there's nobody there named Terry, but
[12:53.570 --> 12:56.050]  very different as shop layouts. I mean,
[12:56.050 --> 12:59.970]  I might have 20 people in my butt 20 customers in my bedroom at one time,
[13:00.570 --> 13:04.450]  um, being helped by five or six different bud tenders. Um,
[13:04.490 --> 13:07.450]  all this moving around, it can get like kind of crazy.
[13:07.930 --> 13:09.890]  And they play loud music in your bedroom too.
[13:09.930 --> 13:14.930]  It's loud. So there's music going and people go in and people come in and out
[13:15.450 --> 13:18.050]  shopping, IDs getting checked, people waiting in line.
[13:18.490 --> 13:22.650]  And then other times it's super slow. Um, like it just varies.
[13:23.650 --> 13:24.850]  All right. So we made a little,
[13:24.930 --> 13:27.370]  some just a very short list of things to talk about here.
[13:27.370 --> 13:28.930]  Cause we wanted to have something to talk about.
[13:28.930 --> 13:30.210]  I know you guys like it when it rambled,
[13:30.210 --> 13:32.690]  but we want some structure to this madness. Uh,
[13:32.730 --> 13:35.090]  the first thing that you should think about when you're in the dispensary,
[13:35.570 --> 13:38.970]  a lot of you people that are listening, uh, this may not apply,
[13:38.970 --> 13:41.010]  but a lot of people need to think about this one. Uh,
[13:41.010 --> 13:44.490]  watch your mouth in the dispensary. Uh, I'm not saying you can't say the F word.
[13:44.490 --> 13:45.930]  You can't, you can't use profanity,
[13:45.930 --> 13:49.210]  but if you have any intentions of the product that you were buying,
[13:49.210 --> 13:52.490]  leaving your hands, just keep your mouth shut about it. Don't hint about it.
[13:52.490 --> 13:55.530]  Don't joke about it. You're not going to flip that.
[13:55.650 --> 13:59.250]  It is not for anybody else. And you are not going to ship that product.
[13:59.530 --> 14:03.090]  If any of those things are going to happen, if you're even allowed the sale,
[14:03.210 --> 14:05.090]  the moment you walk out of the door,
[14:05.290 --> 14:08.090]  the bud tender and the manager have a little meeting together and they're like,
[14:08.090 --> 14:10.730]  Hey, fuck this guy. And they put you on the band list.
[14:11.010 --> 14:13.810]  And we have it in the computer to where when we run your name that you're
[14:13.850 --> 14:18.770]  checking in, it pops up and says, do not sell to this customer. So don't,
[14:18.810 --> 14:23.930]  don't talk about it. Don't you might do it. That might be your thing. Cool.
[14:24.970 --> 14:27.850]  I'm not going to say do that, but I mean, fucking do that. If that's your thing,
[14:27.970 --> 14:31.090]  do your thing player, pimp it out, but don't tell us about it.
[14:31.090 --> 14:33.010]  We don't want to know about your black market hustle.
[14:33.010 --> 14:34.330]  We've gone legit for a reason.
[14:34.570 --> 14:38.930]  We have to cut you off if you tell us that we don't want to have to cut you off.
[14:38.970 --> 14:41.250]  So do your thing and just keep your mouth shut.
[14:42.090 --> 14:42.930]  Yeah.
[14:42.930 --> 14:47.170]  Legally we are not allowed to sell you anything.
[14:47.570 --> 14:52.570]  Once you say to us that you are going to take that weed and redistribute it in
[14:53.290 --> 14:55.490]  any form. Um,
[14:56.050 --> 15:00.330]  at that point we have to refuse the sale and say,
[15:00.330 --> 15:04.810]  sorry, we can't sell you anything. You got to leave now. Thank you.
[15:05.090 --> 15:08.170]  Like it, it's so serious. You can't,
[15:08.170 --> 15:10.770]  you can't walk into a bedroom and say, Oh,
[15:10.770 --> 15:15.330]  this this two ounces of wax that I'm picking up are all going to go to Florida.
[15:16.130 --> 15:19.490]  You can't say like, I'm so like, thank you. Have a great day.
[15:19.970 --> 15:21.810]  Yeah. That was fun. Thinking you were going to buy that.
[15:21.850 --> 15:22.730]  I get the same thing.
[15:22.730 --> 15:26.210]  I used to joke that I wanted to make a hat that says stop asking me how to take
[15:26.210 --> 15:30.290]  this to Texas. Yeah, for sure. Is it's, I mean,
[15:30.290 --> 15:33.890]  sometimes it's innocent. Like you look at, they'll look up and go like,
[15:33.930 --> 15:37.410]  do you think the drug dog's going to smell the weed candy bar in the cooler?
[15:38.210 --> 15:42.010]  It, my response is always just a flat level look right in the eye and go, yeah,
[15:43.090 --> 15:47.290]  like it's not magic. Um, and to make matters worse,
[15:47.290 --> 15:50.930]  it's been in a weed store full of other weed getting touched by people that
[15:50.930 --> 15:52.450]  touch weed over and over and over again.
[15:54.090 --> 15:58.690]  Like just because the chocolate happens to be in a child proof container doesn't
[15:58.690 --> 16:02.290]  mean it's special. Um,
[16:02.690 --> 16:07.490]  just stop. Like I, we know that people are going to do this from time to time.
[16:07.490 --> 16:11.730]  We can't stop you. But if you, uh, um,
[16:11.930 --> 16:15.970]  articulate that in the bud room where we have to get refused the sale and kick
[16:15.970 --> 16:18.090]  you out. And that sucks. It's not fun for anybody.
[16:18.490 --> 16:20.770]  We don't want to kick people out. You don't want to get kicked out.
[16:20.770 --> 16:23.170]  Just knock it off. All right. So watch your mouth when you're in there, you guys.
[16:24.050 --> 16:27.130]  Sorry, we went off on a tangent, but they like it when we ramble. Uh,
[16:27.170 --> 16:29.970]  since Lindsay's here, here is something that we thought we should talk about.
[16:30.170 --> 16:31.090]  When you're in the dispensary,
[16:31.090 --> 16:34.730]  oftentimes there are beautiful young ladies working at the counter.
[16:34.850 --> 16:39.050]  They will greet you. They will take your ID. They'll check your paperwork. Uh,
[16:39.290 --> 16:41.730]  don't fucking flirt with them. They're not there for you to flirt with.
[16:41.890 --> 16:44.650]  Keep your dick in your pants at the dispensary. Chill out on that shit.
[16:44.650 --> 16:47.090]  They're trying to work. They got a job to do. They don't want to fucking hear it.
[16:47.130 --> 16:50.770]  They've been there all day working that they're not. They're not there for that.
[16:50.810 --> 16:53.610]  Just shut up. Keep it to yourself. Save it for later.
[16:53.930 --> 16:56.130]  It is leave Lindsay alone. Leave all the other hotties at work.
[16:56.130 --> 16:58.730]  It's been three alone. They don't want to hear it. They're cool.
[16:59.290 --> 17:02.010]  You wouldn't even believe it. Yeah, I'm sure.
[17:02.770 --> 17:05.810]  I've seen it once or twice when I was there shopping and like that just
[17:05.810 --> 17:07.450]  happened. It's fucking funny.
[17:07.650 --> 17:11.130]  It's constant and it's disturbingly frequent.
[17:11.370 --> 17:14.930]  Lindsay's one of my best friends and I love it when we hang out at events. Uh,
[17:14.970 --> 17:17.850]  people always think we're together cause she's got dreadlocks. I've got dreadlocks.
[17:18.410 --> 17:21.130]  We look like we could hang out. You know what I mean? I wouldn't be surprised.
[17:21.130 --> 17:23.290]  You know, and people would know if we said we dated people like, yeah,
[17:23.290 --> 17:27.930]  I saw that coming. We became too good of friends and skip that phase. So, uh,
[17:27.930 --> 17:31.050]  but I love it when we hang out at events cause people think we're together and
[17:31.050 --> 17:33.930]  guys don't bother her and girls don't even come talk to me.
[17:33.930 --> 17:36.930]  And a lot of times other dudes won't even come talk to me because they think
[17:36.930 --> 17:39.130]  I'm talking to a girl and they're like, Oh, just leave him alone.
[17:39.170 --> 17:42.530]  We just get to hang out and enjoy some time and some music and wherever we went
[17:42.530 --> 17:44.010]  for a few minutes. It's kind of nice.
[17:45.090 --> 17:49.170]  Yes. Secret session. Can't wait. I know when, I know when it's going to happen.
[17:49.170 --> 17:50.490]  I know when it's going to happen.
[17:50.970 --> 17:52.970]  The date got released on Monday. Did they really?
[17:54.650 --> 17:58.330]  That's one a third. I think I'm in Vegas that day. Yeah, you are. I am. God,
[17:58.330 --> 18:02.130]  stop telling people that in the podcast. And I said that,
[18:03.570 --> 18:04.410]  God damn it.
[18:08.490 --> 18:13.050]  We're way off on some tangents. Man, my bad on the dabs earlier guys.
[18:16.210 --> 18:18.770]  Yeah. My eyes are as red as the red in my Colorado shirt.
[18:19.170 --> 18:21.730]  I read you sitting here looking at it like I could go for a while.
[18:23.810 --> 18:26.010]  We're not going to stop you. If you think you could go for one more,
[18:26.010 --> 18:29.610]  we need you to do that. Where do you want to be? You don't have a show to host.
[18:30.090 --> 18:33.210]  I'll drive. You just ramble in the middle. I'm on it.
[18:33.490 --> 18:36.170]  Like she just handed you the hash to take as big a dab as you want.
[18:36.170 --> 18:40.330]  Is that a lemon G? No, that is the cactus cooler. Okay. All right.
[18:40.410 --> 18:43.650]  It tastes like lemon G when I hit it, but yeah, it's very delicious.
[18:43.650 --> 18:48.170]  The stuff's delicious. I finally ended up with a cut of that cactus cooler.
[18:49.130 --> 18:51.810]  Yeah. I know we talked about that. I'm stoked.
[18:51.810 --> 18:54.130]  That's going to be fun to play with you guys. Cactus cooler.
[18:54.450 --> 18:56.850]  If you've ever had a cactus cooler soda, it tastes just like it.
[18:57.010 --> 18:58.490]  I know it sounds like bullshit, but it does.
[18:59.010 --> 19:03.770]  Is it crazy that it smells and tastes like fruit loops to me and it's like flower
[19:03.770 --> 19:08.370]  form. Okay. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, I agree. Okay. For sure.
[19:08.530 --> 19:11.170]  I like opened up the jar of it the other day at the shop and I was like,
[19:11.170 --> 19:12.730]  get up on Mike a little bit. Let him hear you.
[19:14.970 --> 19:16.250]  All right. That's enough. I was just kidding.
[19:17.850 --> 19:18.890]  I was happy to old
[19:20.010 --> 19:22.050]  dude is dying from a dam over here.
[19:22.050 --> 19:26.370]  I live in pro. Are you sure?
[19:32.970 --> 19:34.490]  I didn't give him the dab. I didn't kill him.
[19:35.570 --> 19:36.770]  He took it himself.
[19:37.330 --> 19:41.290]  The next bullet point, the next bullet point we've got written down is when
[19:41.290 --> 19:44.610]  you're at the dispensary and you're buying either the medical or the recreational
[19:44.610 --> 19:48.450]  dispensary, don't tell me how high you are. I'm at work, fucker.
[19:48.450 --> 19:51.770]  I've been here for probably four or six hours and haven't had a chance to go
[19:51.770 --> 19:54.290]  blaze. And you're telling me I'm so high right now. Shut up.
[19:54.570 --> 19:57.770]  It's not like that. That's a good point. Yeah, that's a great point.
[19:57.970 --> 20:01.250]  Leave me the fuck alone. But, um,
[20:01.570 --> 20:02.970]  the other thing is like you,
[20:03.130 --> 20:08.090]  you guys usually say that after you've done something either really wrong or
[20:08.090 --> 20:12.530]  said something really wrong or said something really illegal or like
[20:13.210 --> 20:17.010]  minimal, really embarrassing. Yeah. Like, Oh man,
[20:17.210 --> 20:20.930]  just drove here. Right. Like, and I don't understand. Um, I mean like,
[20:21.010 --> 20:23.010]  I just don't know if you're trying to look cool while you're saying it,
[20:23.010 --> 20:26.770]  but like, I'm not trying to be mean. It really doesn't make you look cool.
[20:26.810 --> 20:31.450]  It just makes me think that you're an airhead stoner.
[20:31.530 --> 20:32.370]  I don't know.
[20:33.730 --> 20:36.290]  Yeah. That I'm so high right now. I think it's a little old,
[20:37.010 --> 20:40.810]  especially when we're at work. Yeah. We wish we were stone too,
[20:40.810 --> 20:42.650]  but we're at work. It's a real job.
[20:42.650 --> 20:45.530]  That's something that a lot of people don't get. Um,
[20:45.650 --> 20:47.490]  the guy that works at the liquor store isn't drunk.
[20:48.290 --> 20:50.570]  Like why does everyone assume we're baked out of our mind?
[20:53.810 --> 20:55.050]  On the premises, you can't smoke.
[20:55.610 --> 20:59.450]  A thousand feet away from cigarettes on the grow.
[20:59.570 --> 21:03.210]  No, at the crawl or on the, on the dispensary premises.
[21:03.210 --> 21:06.690]  Like isn't there like a, you have to be a certain feet away from
[21:07.090 --> 21:07.850]  policy.
[21:07.850 --> 21:12.850]  Usually anything that can be construed as marijuana consumption can get a shop
[21:13.210 --> 21:14.130]  in a lot of trouble.
[21:14.450 --> 21:18.010]  And so there are plenty of shops that don't even let people consume tobacco on
[21:18.010 --> 21:18.770]  the property.
[21:18.770 --> 21:21.530]  I don't like it when people roll into the dispensary and they're smoking a
[21:21.530 --> 21:24.970]  cigarette because now I have to really sit there and look and see what you're
[21:24.970 --> 21:28.170]  smoking realistically. Because I mean,
[21:28.170 --> 21:32.850]  you guys just come in and say the weirdest stuff and most illegal stuff.
[21:32.850 --> 21:36.250]  So I have to assume you're coming in and doing it too.
[21:37.850 --> 21:41.330]  It's just chill. Just chill. Chill the fuck out. You guys.
[21:42.050 --> 21:46.570]  It's you gotta remember what we're doing here. Like yes, it's a weed store.
[21:46.970 --> 21:51.490]  Yes. The people in it are also huge cannabis fans. We, we really like it too.
[21:51.890 --> 21:55.850]  We love getting dabbed to the point where we're fucking this high. Um,
[21:56.250 --> 21:57.090]  but uh,
[21:57.690 --> 22:01.690]  we don't roll into this supermarket and when we go to pay for our shit,
[22:01.690 --> 22:03.050]  like, yo, I'm so high right now.
[22:03.810 --> 22:04.650]  Some of us do.
[22:04.770 --> 22:06.130]  Some of us do, but like,
[22:06.170 --> 22:07.290]  yeah, but it's the same people doing it.
[22:07.290 --> 22:09.090]  Knock it off. It's annoying there too.
[22:11.690 --> 22:14.930]  Well, I like the, the, whoever made the liquor store analogy,
[22:14.970 --> 22:17.290]  I think it was you Mike. Yeah. I like,
[22:17.450 --> 22:21.090]  you don't walk into the liquor store drinking. Why would you like, you know,
[22:21.090 --> 22:23.290]  it's just like a lot of people do.
[22:23.450 --> 22:24.170]  Yeah. You got to respect.
[22:24.170 --> 22:28.690]  There's a business license at stake at these places and the licenses are
[22:28.810 --> 22:30.210]  ridiculously expensive.
[22:30.370 --> 22:35.370]  And shops can lose them for very minor for things that you do.
[22:35.890 --> 22:40.890]  Yeah. Seemingly innocuous things. If customers, for example,
[22:41.290 --> 22:44.730]  check out, take their product and then walk into the bathroom with it,
[22:45.210 --> 22:46.250]  we can get fined.
[22:46.730 --> 22:50.410]  And so our security guard is forever on the lookout for anyone headed towards
[22:50.410 --> 22:53.730]  the bathroom just so we can make sure they don't happen to have a bag that a
[22:53.730 --> 22:56.930]  sealed product bag with them. Um,
[22:56.970 --> 23:01.290]  cause it could look like onsite consumption and just that somebody walking in
[23:01.290 --> 23:02.210]  there, setting the bag,
[23:02.330 --> 23:04.970]  the stuff they just bought on the paper towel dispenser,
[23:05.330 --> 23:10.050]  going to the bathroom, washing their hands and leaving could cost us our license.
[23:11.170 --> 23:15.610]  Um, and like, I don't really want to out the shops like annual gross or anything,
[23:15.610 --> 23:19.890]  but like we do a good bit of business and that business employs a good number of
[23:19.890 --> 23:24.490]  people and all of that's over because some dude took a shit next to a bag of
[23:24.490 --> 23:25.930]  marijuana. He legally purchased.
[23:27.010 --> 23:30.130]  That license that just to get started a million bucks,
[23:30.130 --> 23:34.130]  600,000 to a million bucks just to get started with a dispensary.
[23:34.490 --> 23:39.690]  And that's all your permits and stuff. That's not even a place to have it,
[23:40.170 --> 23:43.730]  a place you have a grow. There are so many more things to think about.
[23:43.750 --> 23:47.530]  That is just permitting like, excuse me, permits and, uh,
[23:47.850 --> 23:49.090]  being licensed.
[23:51.170 --> 23:55.090]  We couldn't at all do what we do under the level of scrutiny that we operate
[23:55.090 --> 23:57.170]  under. If we were all baked all day.
[23:57.170 --> 24:00.090]  And that brings me to one of the next bullet points that we wrote down.
[24:00.130 --> 24:04.730]  Don't blame the rules on the bud tenders. A lot. I've seen people get mad.
[24:04.730 --> 24:06.970]  They've showed up to the spot dispensary where Mike works.
[24:06.970 --> 24:09.370]  Let's try not to say their name too much. But Lindsey called him out for us.
[24:09.450 --> 24:13.730]  Oh my God. You're all right. I am no longer affiliated,
[24:13.730 --> 24:16.250]  so I don't say their name too much. No hatred or anything.
[24:16.250 --> 24:17.970]  Just let that be known. Um,
[24:18.730 --> 24:21.690]  so they have a security guard right as you walk in security guard right there,
[24:21.770 --> 24:24.490]  boom, waiting for you. And he's like ID please. And a lot of people are like,
[24:24.810 --> 24:27.410]  who the fuck are you? Well, actually, who the fuck are you?
[24:27.490 --> 24:30.010]  You're coming into our place. You know, that's kind of the vibe right there.
[24:30.010 --> 24:31.970]  Don't walk into here and question authority.
[24:32.330 --> 24:35.210]  Like that security guard is there to keep that place compliant.
[24:35.210 --> 24:36.170]  Because if you're not old enough,
[24:36.170 --> 24:41.050]  customers sit there and talk shit about him. Like it's nuts.
[24:41.650 --> 24:44.530]  Um, people do the weirdest shit at the weed store.
[24:45.250 --> 24:46.650]  The weirdest stuff.
[24:47.250 --> 24:50.610]  But those security guards are only doing their job. The rules are, and we have,
[24:50.730 --> 24:53.530]  yes. And people that are that people that hate the security guard,
[24:53.770 --> 24:55.250]  that dude is just doing his job,
[24:55.250 --> 24:58.570]  making sure that people that aren't under 21 don't get in there.
[24:58.610 --> 25:01.130]  Because if people are under 21, get in there and buy weed, guess what?
[25:01.130 --> 25:01.970]  Place closes.
[25:02.290 --> 25:05.450]  Then don't get mad at Mike or Lindsay when they won't sell you product
[25:05.450 --> 25:08.410]  illegally. There's a business license at stake here.
[25:08.970 --> 25:10.930]  I most of my listeners, we don't even have to tell them this,
[25:10.930 --> 25:13.010]  but maybe they'll, they'll share this. Uh,
[25:13.010 --> 25:16.290]  there are cameras everywhere from at the grow.
[25:16.650 --> 25:18.490]  I can't go anywhere and not be,
[25:18.490 --> 25:20.770]  I can barely close the bathroom door and then I'm not on camera.
[25:20.810 --> 25:23.050]  As long as I'm in there with the bathroom door closed and I'm not on camera,
[25:23.050 --> 25:25.770]  as soon as I walk out back on camera, time to go smile.
[25:25.770 --> 25:28.010]  You're on candid camera from every freaking angle.
[25:28.330 --> 25:31.210]  And the cameras are so good that if we lose a key,
[25:31.450 --> 25:34.570]  you can circle the key on the screen with your finger.
[25:34.570 --> 25:38.330]  You circle the key and then you can track the key and the video.
[25:38.330 --> 25:41.450]  The video will just follow the key from camera to camera and show you where it
[25:41.450 --> 25:44.010]  goes until you can find your keys that you lost earlier today.
[25:44.010 --> 25:47.890]  That's how good those cameras are. And so anybody that thinks that they're like,
[25:47.890 --> 25:50.730]  well, just do this for me. There's no, just do this for me.
[25:50.730 --> 25:54.530]  Every time something happens, it's on camera, it's documented in a computer.
[25:54.690 --> 25:57.490]  There's no pulling no fast one. So there's no getting away with that shit.
[25:57.490 --> 26:02.290]  And nobody would risk their a hundred thousand dollar facility for just to sell
[26:02.290 --> 26:05.930]  you an extra illegal gram or three or an ounce. It's not worth it.
[26:05.930 --> 26:10.450]  The other that 30 to $400 they would make is not worth their business license
[26:10.450 --> 26:13.090]  because they have five other customers in line that are going to spend that
[26:13.090 --> 26:15.010]  already. They don't need to risk it on you.
[26:15.290 --> 26:16.930]  So don't don't ask people to break the rules.
[26:16.930 --> 26:19.290]  Don't be mad at Mike and Lindsay and myself,
[26:19.290 --> 26:23.090]  even that there are rules that have to be enforced. Just how that shit is.
[26:24.130 --> 26:27.650]  We get to play. Let us play. We paid to play. Let us do it.
[26:29.250 --> 26:30.450]  Like, I don't know.
[26:30.450 --> 26:34.050]  It's the stuff people complain about and the rules they break are so bizarre.
[26:34.490 --> 26:36.650]  Like that security guards there for your safety too.
[26:37.250 --> 26:41.010]  Like we just had a shop in Aurora get robbed or where the security guard was
[26:41.010 --> 26:42.250]  shot three times and killed.
[26:42.570 --> 26:46.370]  I was just going to say that. And the one in the Springs that got held up, um,
[26:46.410 --> 26:47.250]  yesterday.
[26:47.250 --> 26:48.170]  I didn't see that one yet.
[26:48.290 --> 26:52.570]  Yeah. As, as a whole, like the, the statistics on it, don't,
[26:52.610 --> 26:56.810]  the dispensaries get robbed a lot less frequently than they should statistically.
[26:57.290 --> 27:00.770]  Um, because most people know we have intense security, uh,
[27:00.810 --> 27:04.730]  kit setups on, uh, every shop it's required. Um,
[27:04.770 --> 27:08.370]  if you don't have a security system good enough to bust anybody doing something
[27:08.370 --> 27:10.730]  stupid on the property, you don't get a license.
[27:10.730 --> 27:14.530]  You don't get to be a marijuana business. That's just how it is in Colorado.
[27:14.530 --> 27:18.410]  So it's not as frequent as it could be. Um,
[27:18.410 --> 27:21.650]  especially giving the net cash nature only in most of the business,
[27:21.650 --> 27:24.770]  but it's still an issue. Like the armed security guards there for a reason,
[27:25.090 --> 27:30.090]  the rules that we operate under are there for a reason that reason might be an
[27:30.370 --> 27:35.370]  often is making some whining son of a bitch up in Denver that's operating from a
[27:36.530 --> 27:39.130]  place of fear and paranoia and has no idea what they're talking about.
[27:39.130 --> 27:42.130]  So they created some dumb ass rule we have to follow. Um,
[27:42.130 --> 27:45.690]  but we're all willing to follow right now just to set a good example for
[27:45.690 --> 27:50.210]  legalization. Um, under no circumstances are we going to sell you over the limit?
[27:50.770 --> 27:53.930]  Um, under no circumstances are we going to tell you where you can buy pounds?
[27:54.450 --> 27:58.450]  Um, most of us don't even know anymore because why would we bother?
[28:00.290 --> 28:01.610]  It's just not worth it.
[28:02.570 --> 28:07.570]  I can't stress enough how regulated the cannabis industry is from seed to sale
[28:08.170 --> 28:10.650]  from seed to sale is what they call it. Absolutely.
[28:10.650 --> 28:15.650]  It is so regulated and for all of you who don't live in Colorado and think that
[28:17.410 --> 28:21.770]  it is just some, and when you come here, you guys think it's just some,
[28:21.810 --> 28:26.730]  you know, open system. It's not, we are so regulated and you guys are right.
[28:26.730 --> 28:30.690]  We can't just slip you an extra. I can't just bring you up for an extra.
[28:31.170 --> 28:34.130]  If, excuse me, if, uh, um,
[28:34.490 --> 28:39.330]  if they look at the books and see that I sold you over what your limit is,
[28:40.010 --> 28:43.570]  I can get in trouble. The whole shop can get in trouble. We can get shut down.
[28:43.570 --> 28:47.650]  They can just come in and say, okay, that's it. Shut down until,
[28:47.970 --> 28:52.210]  until further notice until we've gone through your books and seen what we like.
[28:52.210 --> 28:55.730]  You know, we've gone through everything, everything, right? And then that's it.
[28:55.770 --> 29:00.050]  No jobs, no nothing, no reason to grow.
[29:00.090 --> 29:03.370]  There's no store. Yep. So you know what I mean? Like it's just,
[29:03.370 --> 29:05.850]  I'd be done. My tremor would be done.
[29:06.370 --> 29:09.610]  There's how many people at green and healthy at the store for four of us,
[29:09.650 --> 29:11.130]  all four of you would be done.
[29:11.970 --> 29:15.290]  It's not just the one location that it gets screwed up at.
[29:15.330 --> 29:16.970]  It's every license tied to it.
[29:17.010 --> 29:20.890]  It's happened a couple of times in Colorado where, um,
[29:21.290 --> 29:24.330]  a marijuana business with five or six different licenses,
[29:24.330 --> 29:26.810]  they had a couple of dispensaries, um,
[29:26.850 --> 29:31.090]  one or two grows and maybe a product manufacturing license somewhere doing hash.
[29:31.650 --> 29:34.330]  Um, one specific license,
[29:34.330 --> 29:38.050]  one specific location had a couple of violations. Um,
[29:38.050 --> 29:42.650]  two weeks later, all seven licenses suspended indefinitely.
[29:43.130 --> 29:46.210]  Um, seven months later when they finally get a hearing,
[29:46.530 --> 29:49.810]  their licenses are revoked. Um, and the,
[29:49.850 --> 29:53.010]  the whole business is closed. Millions of dollars gone,
[29:53.290 --> 29:56.970]  dozens of people out of work. Um, and what,
[29:57.450 --> 30:00.170]  you just wandered off the street from Texas.
[30:00.210 --> 30:01.410]  Why would I sell you over the limit?
[30:03.850 --> 30:06.730]  Why would, why would I mean, it just doesn't make any sense why you're asking.
[30:06.730 --> 30:11.370]  It's confusing. Marisol will. Oh, allegedly. I'm just kidding. They will not.
[30:11.450 --> 30:13.770]  They probably won't. All right. Here's where I get to a segue.
[30:13.770 --> 30:17.810]  You kind of just set me up into a good segue for something that this is a line
[30:17.810 --> 30:21.210]  that Mike and I used to get to say to people at our dispensary that we had,
[30:21.210 --> 30:25.010]  that we, uh, that this is where I first employed. Mike is,
[30:25.050 --> 30:27.370]  we didn't put this one on the list of stuff. We didn't go over this,
[30:27.370 --> 30:28.370]  but I already know what he's going to say.
[30:28.370 --> 30:30.290]  Yeah. This was the greatest thing to say to people.
[30:30.490 --> 30:33.050]  Cause there are no returns at a dispensary. If you buy a product,
[30:33.050 --> 30:34.650]  we legally cannot take it back from you.
[30:34.650 --> 30:36.730]  If you leave the store with that product, it is now yours.
[30:36.730 --> 30:39.370]  Please look at the product that you were going to buy before you purchase it.
[30:39.650 --> 30:41.570]  We'll show it to you. We'll fucking take it out of the package.
[30:41.610 --> 30:43.970]  You can't touch it until you purchase it. That's a rule in the store.
[30:44.290 --> 30:46.810]  You can't put your hands on it, but you can get real close and look at it.
[30:47.050 --> 30:49.930]  You can tell what it is. You could smell it. We don't do no bait and switch.
[30:49.930 --> 30:53.490]  There's none of that shit. You, the, if you want this gram that you see,
[30:53.810 --> 30:57.130]  Lindsey will put the lid on that gram and you can't carry it to the counter.
[30:57.330 --> 31:00.370]  A badged employee actually has to carry that product to the cash register and
[31:00.370 --> 31:03.010]  ring it up. And until it's packaged and ready to go, they can't give it to you,
[31:03.010 --> 31:06.370]  but you'll get that gram. So just there are no returns.
[31:06.410 --> 31:07.810]  Make sure you like that shit before you leave.
[31:07.810 --> 31:10.330]  And then don't go home and complain on Facebook that you bought some shit that
[31:10.330 --> 31:13.290]  you didn't want. That's my advice. No returns at the dispensary.
[31:13.530 --> 31:14.930]  That leads me into this next part.
[31:15.570 --> 31:19.130]  There are no discounts at the dispensary either. If you know, hunt good for you.
[31:19.130 --> 31:20.810]  If you know Rasta, Jeff, I'm sorry,
[31:20.810 --> 31:23.610]  we can't give you a discount because Rasta Jeff does not make the prices here
[31:23.610 --> 31:24.050]  at the store.
[31:24.050 --> 31:27.450]  The store prices are set by the owner of the store and they're held by the
[31:27.450 --> 31:30.290]  management. We can't fuck with that. That's how it goes. Uh,
[31:30.810 --> 31:32.170]  here's the old line that somebody used to,
[31:32.290 --> 31:34.810]  everybody used to love to tell Mike and I, uh,
[31:34.810 --> 31:36.210]  when we had the dispensary downtown,
[31:36.450 --> 31:39.330]  but the dispensary in the County will give me ounces for way cheaper than you.
[31:39.450 --> 31:42.050]  It's cheaper over there. What's the deal? And it's like, dude,
[31:42.050 --> 31:43.650]  if that's really the price, why did you come here?
[31:43.690 --> 31:44.570]  That's what we would always tell them.
[31:44.570 --> 31:46.570]  We'll go over there and get an ounce and get me one while you're there.
[31:46.570 --> 31:47.970]  I'll give you money if it's that cheap.
[31:48.250 --> 31:50.690]  And they just look at you like fuck because they were lying every time.
[31:50.690 --> 31:51.210]  We knew it.
[31:51.210 --> 31:55.130]  The one I get all the time now is my, well, my cousin has ounces for this.
[31:55.130 --> 32:00.010]  And I'm like, well, if that's true, you're here for one of two reasons.
[32:00.050 --> 32:04.610]  A he got sick of you for some reason and stopped answering your phone calls or
[32:04.610 --> 32:09.210]  B you got sick of having one weed option and you came to a store that has 50.
[32:10.610 --> 32:12.090]  Um, you came here for a reason.
[32:12.570 --> 32:16.970]  That reason wasn't we had ounces for the same price as your cousin.
[32:17.090 --> 32:17.930]  It's your cousin's weed.
[32:18.090 --> 32:20.810]  And thanks for incriminating your cousin. BT dubs.
[32:21.610 --> 32:24.690]  Like can we sloppy calls? I had dry snitching.
[32:27.130 --> 32:28.730]  Shout out to my man sloppy up on the mountain.
[32:28.730 --> 32:31.050]  I hope you listen to the podcast still rather nothing but love.
[32:31.210 --> 32:33.970]  Uh, we can talk about it now. Congratulations on the little one sloppy.
[32:33.970 --> 32:37.010]  You've made it public. Congratulations. Much love on the little sloppy,
[32:37.650 --> 32:38.970]  little, little sloppy Savannah.
[32:39.050 --> 32:40.890]  I'm so excited for Papa slop.
[32:40.930 --> 32:44.410]  Did you guys not hear how tired I am? Well, like I'm just saying,
[32:44.410 --> 32:47.130]  we've been saying congratulations to a lot of people lately and I'm starting to
[32:47.130 --> 32:49.050]  think people don't understand how exhausted I am.
[32:49.170 --> 32:52.450]  Slopsy young kid and wants to fuck. So I mean he done made him a baby.
[32:52.490 --> 32:53.330]  That's how it works.
[32:54.570 --> 32:57.690]  You like to fuck as much as sloppy does. You make some babies birth control.
[32:59.130 --> 33:01.290]  I don't know what I just wanted it to. Sorry.
[33:04.210 --> 33:07.770]  Anyways, what's next on your list? Next on my list. Uh, no discounts.
[33:07.770 --> 33:10.490]  B if you can get it, if you're going to tell me that it's cheaper over at that
[33:10.490 --> 33:12.170]  store, go to that fucking store and get it there.
[33:12.170 --> 33:14.930]  Don't tell me how cheap it is there. Uh, if you're cool and deserve it,
[33:14.930 --> 33:17.770]  if you don't ask for some discounts and there's a discount available,
[33:17.930 --> 33:20.610]  the bud tender will be kind enough to go, Hey, you want a dickhead? Uh,
[33:20.650 --> 33:23.650]  today is fucking titties Tuesday and you get the titties discount or whatever it
[33:23.650 --> 33:26.810]  happens to be and you'll get some deals. You don't have to beg for anything.
[33:26.810 --> 33:31.170]  We they, they slash we will give all of the customers the appropriate discounts.
[33:32.330 --> 33:34.130]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[33:34.330 --> 33:37.050]  I feel like I should add that there's no minimum purchase.
[33:37.050 --> 33:39.930]  Like because you made it into the butter room doesn't mean you have to buy
[33:39.930 --> 33:43.850]  something and act like I'm robbing you. That's true. You pay for it.
[33:43.930 --> 33:46.730]  That is very true. Say no. Thank you. Yeah. Turn around and leave.
[33:47.170 --> 33:51.090]  Is that I do it at stores all the time that aren't even weed related.
[33:51.410 --> 33:52.130]  I walk in,
[33:52.130 --> 33:56.730]  I realize that I don't need to spend $85 on a G shirt and I don't buy it.
[33:57.890 --> 34:01.770]  Um, I'm not rude when I do it and the customer,
[34:01.770 --> 34:03.490]  the employees there aren't offended when I do it.
[34:03.810 --> 34:06.090]  But every now and then I'll have somebody that comes in,
[34:06.530 --> 34:10.490]  is shocked by the price of legal marijuana. I,
[34:10.610 --> 34:12.850]  I ask them what they want. They're like, well,
[34:12.850 --> 34:14.930]  go ahead and give me a gram of that. And when I ring them up,
[34:14.930 --> 34:18.370]  they act like I've grabbed them by the balls and I'm squeezing money out of
[34:18.370 --> 34:21.050]  their pocket. It's so bizarre.
[34:21.370 --> 34:25.130]  If you do have an experience at a dispensary, um,
[34:25.810 --> 34:28.130]  I gotta quit saying, um, when you have,
[34:28.130 --> 34:30.410]  if you have a shitty experience at a dispensary,
[34:30.410 --> 34:32.130]  whether it's recreational or retail,
[34:33.210 --> 34:38.050]  the first plan of attack is not to go to weed maps and Facebook and bash the
[34:38.050 --> 34:40.490]  place. You should go back,
[34:40.770 --> 34:44.530]  either call or go back and see if the problem can't be resolved in an adult
[34:44.530 --> 34:47.450]  manner before you go try to get crazy on the internet.
[34:47.450 --> 34:50.690]  Everyone's a keyboard commando and they're all fired up. Chill the fuck out.
[34:51.050 --> 34:54.850]  Just call the place. We're all adults. We want you to be happy. We've got,
[34:55.290 --> 34:56.970]  we want you to come back. You know what I mean?
[34:56.970 --> 34:59.650]  We've got a reputation to uphold. We've got a relationship with you.
[34:59.650 --> 35:00.690]  We want you coming back.
[35:00.690 --> 35:03.010]  We don't want to just take your money and forget about you.
[35:03.010 --> 35:05.930]  It's not what it's all about. So if you're not happy with it, don't,
[35:06.250 --> 35:09.290]  don't go bash the internet. Just try to contact the dispensary.
[35:09.730 --> 35:11.090]  Try to go back. If you can.
[35:11.090 --> 35:12.850]  I understand that a lot of you have traveled away.
[35:12.850 --> 35:15.730]  If it's a recreational facility, but if it's a medical place,
[35:16.050 --> 35:18.490]  just come back and talk to us. We can't take your refund.
[35:18.490 --> 35:19.770]  We can't take your shit back,
[35:19.770 --> 35:22.210]  but maybe we can figure out something to make you happier.
[35:22.490 --> 35:25.770]  Maybe we can adjust things, but don't go to the internet and be a dick right away.
[35:26.250 --> 35:29.970]  It's a business. We will run a business. Most places run a business.
[35:30.210 --> 35:33.970]  If they're still around at this point in Colorado, they're probably doing their
[35:34.730 --> 35:38.170]  business. Yeah. All right. So I think that that pretty much, uh,
[35:38.490 --> 35:39.610]  I think that wraps up most of my,
[35:39.610 --> 35:42.410]  unless you guys got something you want to add to the weed etiquette part,
[35:42.610 --> 35:45.010]  then I've got another topic I kind of want to talk about for a couple of
[35:45.010 --> 35:46.170]  minutes. It won't take too long.
[35:47.050 --> 35:51.290]  A recent article up in Denver. Um,
[35:52.050 --> 35:54.090]  some news anchor went online, uh,
[35:54.090 --> 35:56.890]  online to plead with people to wear pants to the dispensary.
[35:57.370 --> 36:00.570]  Apparently he walks by one every day on his way to work or whatever.
[36:00.970 --> 36:03.290]  And there's always people walking in wearing boxers.
[36:03.650 --> 36:07.770]  I assume he means female people. Um, but, uh,
[36:08.890 --> 36:12.050]  I've had a couple of people show up and get, uh, there was,
[36:12.330 --> 36:17.490]  the last one was also drunk. Um, but walk up barefoot, like in topless,
[36:18.410 --> 36:21.970]  um, to the door, like just a dude wearing some shorts, no shoes, no shirt,
[36:21.970 --> 36:26.170]  no nothing. And it's like, no, you're not getting in bro.
[36:27.450 --> 36:29.890]  Um, and then they get offended when they can't get in. It's like,
[36:29.890 --> 36:34.770]  is there any store in America where you can just roll up barefoot and topless and
[36:34.770 --> 36:37.490]  shop at? That's not like an open air market at a beach.
[36:38.730 --> 36:40.530]  Yeah. We're, we're choosing a shirt.
[36:41.050 --> 36:44.450]  Surprisingly, uh, there's a weird lack of common sense.
[36:44.450 --> 36:45.690]  Sometimes when it's the weed straw,
[36:45.690 --> 36:49.330]  I don't know if it's people getting overexcited or people assuming that, uh,
[36:49.370 --> 36:52.490]  because we're the only place on the planet that really has weed stores like
[36:52.490 --> 36:53.410]  this, that none of the
[36:54.850 --> 36:59.690]  they blend drug dealer habit and trap house habit into the
[36:59.690 --> 37:02.650]  store experience because they just in their mind,
[37:02.970 --> 37:07.850]  in your mind going to buy weed was going to some
[37:07.890 --> 37:10.930]  white dude with dreadlocks his house and sitting on his couch and playing
[37:10.930 --> 37:13.290]  dreadlock playing fucking video games for 30 minutes.
[37:13.330 --> 37:15.890]  I put the white guy dreadlocks in there cause it used to be me. That's why,
[37:16.130 --> 37:18.330]  right. Uh, fucking showing up at my house.
[37:18.330 --> 37:21.010]  You just have to come to my house and I'd make you fucking play seven or eight
[37:21.010 --> 37:24.210]  rounds of black ops just so that you didn't look like we were doing business.
[37:24.490 --> 37:27.730]  You have to come and listen to whatever new CD I bought and hang out.
[37:27.770 --> 37:30.210]  That's and so you used to get into that mode.
[37:30.250 --> 37:32.050]  I'm going to go hang out with Jeff for 30 minutes.
[37:32.850 --> 37:35.250]  Two episodes of how it's made and then head home.
[37:35.450 --> 37:37.770]  And they're thinking that that's going to happen and that you're their drug
[37:37.890 --> 37:39.610]  dealer. Now, as soon as they come into the dispensary,
[37:39.610 --> 37:42.090]  you've now become me for these guys in their mind.
[37:42.090 --> 37:43.610]  You're their surrogate weed dealer.
[37:43.810 --> 37:45.770]  There's a little bit of that, but like, dude,
[37:46.250 --> 37:49.690]  a lot of people I bought weed from before, like if you showed up half drunk,
[37:49.690 --> 37:53.650]  barefoot and topless at their house, stumbling across from the street, uh,
[37:53.730 --> 37:56.810]  they'd have screamed at you for 20 minutes before not selling you weed and
[37:56.810 --> 37:57.490]  sending you home.
[37:57.490 --> 38:00.730]  Depends on who you are. If you show up barefoot and topless here,
[38:01.130 --> 38:02.250]  there might be prizes.
[38:02.970 --> 38:06.330]  Um, this is just like 340 pounds.
[38:06.450 --> 38:07.930]  He just gave me the greatest look.
[38:12.090 --> 38:12.930]  Wow.
[38:13.410 --> 38:16.130]  This podcast has got so many places.
[38:16.130 --> 38:18.050]  Just like deny wasn't sure if she was going to do it.
[38:18.050 --> 38:19.610]  She was like, you motherfucker.
[38:20.730 --> 38:24.610]  I wasn't sure if I got props or if she was questioning my judgment or what was
[38:24.610 --> 38:27.610]  happening there. I think it was like, don't encourage him, Jeff. Don't, don't.
[38:28.610 --> 38:32.650]  So I thought I'd write on her face, barefoot naked.
[38:33.330 --> 38:34.410]  I might have prizes for you.
[38:34.530 --> 38:37.330]  This dude was a prize of this dude. I'm not in.
[38:38.370 --> 38:40.250]  If you've got a beer, this does not apply to you.
[38:42.050 --> 38:45.570]  It's been a couple of little bits since we released the last episode and nobody
[38:45.570 --> 38:48.730]  has replied with the Walmart challenge yet or the mullet challenge.
[38:48.850 --> 38:52.370]  We might allow some people by that point in the show. Yeah.
[38:54.330 --> 38:55.250]  All right. So what I want, I mean,
[38:55.250 --> 38:58.050]  I hinted that I wanted to talk about more stuff. Um,
[38:59.050 --> 39:02.650]  recently I've seen people discussing this and I wanted to just state my,
[39:02.730 --> 39:04.730]  my piece on it. Uh, on Facebook,
[39:04.730 --> 39:08.170]  there's a thing going around about illegal cultivators,
[39:08.170 --> 39:12.010]  not wanting cannabis to be legalized because it's putting them out of business.
[39:13.210 --> 39:18.170]  Uh, fuck all that. Come on. Don't be a selfish bitch. This is cannabis.
[39:18.170 --> 39:22.090]  This should be something for everybody and you wanting it not legalized.
[39:22.090 --> 39:24.890]  Do you wanting by not wanting cannabis legalized?
[39:24.970 --> 39:27.210]  And most of my listeners are going to want cannabis legalized,
[39:27.210 --> 39:30.170]  but this is, I'm just kind of going off on my own roster.
[39:30.170 --> 39:33.850]  Jeff rent those people that are selling cannabis illegally and producing and
[39:33.850 --> 39:37.370]  hustling and flipping cannabis illegally that do not want cannabis legalized.
[39:37.890 --> 39:42.370]  The people you are selling that cannabis to are criminals and will go to jail if
[39:42.370 --> 39:45.090]  they are caught with the product you're selling them and you seem to be
[39:45.090 --> 39:48.770]  supporting that. That's bullshit. You're putting your family, yourself,
[39:48.770 --> 39:49.490]  your customers,
[39:49.490 --> 39:54.410]  everyone in danger because you're greedy and you want to have a hustle. Uh,
[39:55.530 --> 39:58.610]  I can kind of be a little bit hypocritical sounding right now because I grow
[39:58.650 --> 40:02.770]  and produce cannabis, but I'm doing it fully legal for a fully regulated facility.
[40:02.930 --> 40:06.810]  I've got a legal legit job, which is possible when you legalize cannabis.
[40:06.810 --> 40:10.610]  I pay taxes. I have a time clock. I'm not looking over my shoulder.
[40:10.850 --> 40:13.650]  Because they don't want it legalized so that you can have your own hustle or
[40:13.650 --> 40:17.410]  kind of being stingy bitches and fucking it up for the rest of the country that
[40:17.410 --> 40:21.010]  wants legalized cannabis. Help us support us out. Uh,
[40:22.490 --> 40:26.330]  what if you helped us legalize it and got into the industry and used your
[40:26.330 --> 40:30.650]  hustler skills to good use and actually put some tax money in and actually got
[40:30.650 --> 40:33.970]  a 401k and actually had some benefits and had something that you could talk
[40:33.970 --> 40:34.970]  about to your family.
[40:35.130 --> 40:39.170]  Right. What if you can do what you want to do all day and not have to risk
[40:39.170 --> 40:40.610]  everything you have to do it?
[40:40.850 --> 40:43.650]  Yeah. Being a drug dealer is only one skill. You're a drug dealer.
[40:43.650 --> 40:47.210]  You can't put that on a resume anywhere. You can't,
[40:47.210 --> 40:48.330]  you can only do that for so long.
[40:48.330 --> 40:52.050]  I think the days of the big trap house grows and the people throwing out mad
[40:52.050 --> 40:56.530]  pounds and flipping packs, uh, that that's going away in Colorado.
[40:59.290 --> 41:01.690]  Pueblo is, is raining in hard.
[41:01.730 --> 41:05.890]  Other cities are also raining in very hard.
[41:05.890 --> 41:09.970]  Like the thing that caught me, um,
[41:10.010 --> 41:14.570]  about all the recent news is that it's all headed to Florida in Texas in
[41:14.690 --> 41:17.610]  places far from legalization. Um,
[41:17.610 --> 41:21.610]  because here the black market price of the pound doesn't make it worth the
[41:21.610 --> 41:25.490]  effort. Truth. Um, it's just not worth the effort and risk anymore.
[41:25.490 --> 41:30.050]  There's not enough profit margin in between what it takes to produce it and
[41:30.050 --> 41:32.770]  distribute it in the profit. You get back from doing that.
[41:32.770 --> 41:34.730]  Just to pay a trimmer and your electricity.
[41:34.730 --> 41:37.370]  You're breaking even nowadays at the cost of cannabis around.
[41:37.570 --> 41:41.170]  If you want to make a profit on it, you've got to drive it far, far away.
[41:41.170 --> 41:45.010]  I have a lot of lights. I have a lot of lights and I run to them.
[41:45.330 --> 41:46.570]  Yeah. And if that's scary,
[41:46.570 --> 41:49.650]  because you're currently involved in the illegal side of things and you don't
[41:49.690 --> 41:53.250]  think there's going to be a place for you in legalization, wise up,
[41:53.290 --> 41:57.130]  get involved with the legalization effort in your area and make sure that those
[41:57.130 --> 41:59.450]  efforts carve out a place for you. Um,
[41:59.490 --> 42:03.770]  I think one of the ways Colorado really fucked up is we didn't,
[42:03.850 --> 42:06.770]  we didn't make, um, uh,
[42:06.810 --> 42:11.290]  I'm trying to get my life in order badge for employees.
[42:11.690 --> 42:15.050]  Like if you have previous felonies and stuff like that,
[42:15.050 --> 42:18.170]  like there's no reason you can't be a trimmer somewhere.
[42:18.410 --> 42:22.010]  There's no reason you can't be working in like a trustee, like a trustee,
[42:22.010 --> 42:24.290]  MED badge. I don't know, something like,
[42:25.010 --> 42:28.010]  like a support and a half badge or something. I don't,
[42:28.290 --> 42:30.970]  I don't know what they would call it, but like white belt. Um,
[42:31.010 --> 42:34.250]  I read articles all the time of people that like have had,
[42:35.010 --> 42:40.010]  have been involved in the black market for cannabis for years in around the
[42:40.290 --> 42:45.170]  country, picked up a couple of charges along the way because of that. Um,
[42:45.210 --> 42:47.890]  they hop in the car, they kind of abandoned what little,
[42:47.890 --> 42:50.850]  they had built up for a life wherever they were. Come here,
[42:51.130 --> 42:55.730]  hoping to get into the industry and realize that we shut the door on all those
[42:55.730 --> 43:00.330]  people right at the beginning of regulation. Um, right off the bat,
[43:00.330 --> 43:05.330]  we said no felonies in five years, no drug felonies in 10 and a story. Um,
[43:05.370 --> 43:09.250]  and that locked out a huge portion of people that have been involved in the black
[43:09.250 --> 43:10.770]  market. Um,
[43:10.810 --> 43:13.730]  and I think a lot of those people that are trying to get their shit together
[43:13.730 --> 43:16.010]  should have a way to work in the legal industry.
[43:16.410 --> 43:18.770]  It's something other than the local head shop.
[43:18.970 --> 43:22.370]  Have you seen what happens when one of those persons that was banned for like 10
[43:22.370 --> 43:25.450]  years when their day comes up and they're allowed to get their badge and you see
[43:25.450 --> 43:28.010]  them fucking jump full force into the industry. Have you seen that?
[43:28.170 --> 43:28.850]  A little bit.
[43:28.850 --> 43:32.010]  I probably pay more attention cause I'm more into the industry side of things in
[43:32.010 --> 43:32.370]  the scene.
[43:32.370 --> 43:34.810]  I pay attention to the breeders and the people who are into that part,
[43:35.090 --> 43:35.730]  but I've seen a car,
[43:35.730 --> 43:38.770]  I won't say their names cause I don't know if that's polite to call people out
[43:38.770 --> 43:40.890]  who just got off a 10 year thing. But, uh,
[43:40.930 --> 43:42.650]  I know what a lot of people have had to wait.
[43:42.850 --> 43:43.730]  And you can see them.
[43:43.730 --> 43:46.410]  They were like at the fucking starting line and someone pulled that trigger.
[43:46.410 --> 43:49.050]  Bang, you can go. And a couple of these people just leapt.
[43:49.050 --> 43:49.850]  I see one seed company.
[43:49.850 --> 43:52.170]  They already had the application ready to go the day of.
[43:52.250 --> 43:53.530]  Seeds packaged,
[43:53.690 --> 43:56.890]  like seeds packaged and everything was ready to go and they were just ready to
[43:56.890 --> 43:57.810]  do it. You know what I mean?
[43:57.810 --> 44:02.610]  Like they were already behind the scenes with some dispensary or telling somebody
[44:02.610 --> 44:05.450]  what to do, you know, guiding them. And then all they had to do was say,
[44:05.450 --> 44:07.730]  this guy's here, we've got his brand, this is happening.
[44:08.170 --> 44:10.210]  And they just went fucking apeshit when that happened.
[44:10.490 --> 44:15.490]  So maybe Colorado should make like a cannabis council that you can appeal.
[44:17.210 --> 44:20.610]  I honestly, I honestly have no idea what we're going to do with the rules are
[44:20.610 --> 44:24.010]  changing in really weird ways right now. Um,
[44:24.570 --> 44:29.130]  cause in a very real way we're inventing this shit as we go. Um,
[44:31.890 --> 44:36.490]  like in the last month we banned a whole bunch of edibles. Um,
[44:36.530 --> 44:39.130]  they can't be certain shapes now. Um,
[44:39.170 --> 44:43.530]  and we let tourists buy four times what they were currently allowed to buy.
[44:44.090 --> 44:48.690]  Um, and those two changes are in direct opposition of each other, um,
[44:48.730 --> 44:53.730]  but are happening at the same time. It's very, very strange. The,
[44:53.730 --> 44:57.250]  the first couple of shops to really get busted for violations are all going
[44:57.250 --> 45:02.050]  through their hearings. That process is being invented right now. Um,
[45:02.050 --> 45:05.410]  and this is going to keep going on for at least five years. Uh,
[45:05.410 --> 45:08.650]  it's a very fun time to live right here in Pueblo. Uh,
[45:08.650 --> 45:13.330]  we just founded a marijuana research Institute here. Yes. Um,
[45:13.370 --> 45:17.730]  $1.2 million in marijuana tax is going to our local university,
[45:18.170 --> 45:21.650]  like 900 from the state, 250 from our local County.
[45:22.050 --> 45:25.090]  Yeah. It's going to Colorado state university here in Pueblo, right?
[45:25.170 --> 45:28.370]  Yep. Uh, CSU P is it's known locally. Um,
[45:28.410 --> 45:32.130]  they're going to be doing medical research and social research.
[45:32.490 --> 45:35.130]  So we'll finally start getting some hard data, um,
[45:35.170 --> 45:38.770]  as to what happens when you legalize marijuana for all adults in the community.
[45:39.450 --> 45:42.010]  Um, lots of cool research taking place down here.
[45:42.930 --> 45:44.370]  I don't know where that came from, but yeah.
[45:45.570 --> 45:47.130]  I like it when you ramble. Yeah.
[45:48.770 --> 45:51.450]  We went from talking about illegal growers to, uh,
[45:51.490 --> 45:55.090]  the university testing and doing studies.
[45:55.530 --> 45:59.050]  Cooler by whoever Lindsey bought that from was,
[45:59.490 --> 46:00.810]  I don't know which company made that.
[46:01.730 --> 46:04.130]  Terpex. That was done by her. That was from us.
[46:04.770 --> 46:08.650]  That's what I thought, but I didn't want to say that cactus cooler cut is kind
[46:08.650 --> 46:09.450]  of exclusive.
[46:09.450 --> 46:13.010]  I was given a cut of that cactus cooler and I was told don't let that out
[46:13.030 --> 46:14.930]  because of this is the only place that has it.
[46:14.930 --> 46:17.250]  And if it's ever seen out on the streets, we know you let it out.
[46:17.690 --> 46:20.130]  And so I've got it in my personal growth. We'll never go anywhere.
[46:20.210 --> 46:21.690]  It will get pollinated with shit.
[46:21.690 --> 46:25.730]  How long ago did I take that dab people? I can still taste it. It's yes. Yeah.
[46:25.770 --> 46:27.890]  Uh, I would like to take a lot of credit for that girl,
[46:27.890 --> 46:30.410]  but honestly you could grow that string with dog poop and it'll come out
[46:30.410 --> 46:34.890]  tasting delicious. It's yeah, it's super flavorful, super turpy.
[46:35.210 --> 46:38.130]  A shout out to the cactus cooler strain. I'm not sure where that one came from.
[46:38.130 --> 46:40.770]  I wish I knew. I have an idea, but I don't want to be wrong.
[46:41.010 --> 46:42.690]  If you know, email the show at
[46:44.090 --> 46:46.730]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Uh, we know, uh,
[46:47.370 --> 46:49.690]  hunt knows who, no, I'm sure I was just,
[46:50.050 --> 46:52.450]  it gave me the layup so I threw it to you,
[46:52.570 --> 46:55.250]  but I was grown by myself at green and healthy trim by our buddy,
[46:55.290 --> 46:58.810]  John Randall's junior shout out Randall's. I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[46:58.810 --> 47:00.610]  In fact, I know you're listening. Happy Monday, brother.
[47:00.890 --> 47:04.010]  I'll be back with me trimming off. It's Monday. You're probably back with me.
[47:04.010 --> 47:05.050]  If not, you will be Tuesday.
[47:05.410 --> 47:08.490]  I was trimmed by Randall's and then it was extracted by our friends at Turpex.
[47:08.490 --> 47:12.050]  I'm not sure which one of the turpy boys ran it. Either Shane, probably Shane,
[47:12.090 --> 47:12.930]  maybe Logan.
[47:13.290 --> 47:16.130]  Really nice job. Yeah, well they do. They do pretty good.
[47:16.130 --> 47:19.930]  I love that chain. Um, not just the boys at turf, but the,
[47:20.450 --> 47:24.290]  it was grown well, it was trimmed well and it was extracted. Well,
[47:24.410 --> 47:25.970]  well thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[47:26.090 --> 47:27.810]  And it made it into the Dabrig well.
[47:27.850 --> 47:30.250]  Getting the system figured out over there at green and healthy wellness.
[47:30.250 --> 47:32.570]  They have a nice gross setup and it took me,
[47:32.970 --> 47:35.890]  I think this is like started pulling like the third harvest out of there.
[47:35.890 --> 47:38.410]  The first harvest, I didn't have full control of the second harvest.
[47:38.450 --> 47:40.690]  I didn't cut the clones. So they were a little overgrown.
[47:40.690 --> 47:44.530]  By the time I got to it now we're in clones that I cut myself. Uh,
[47:44.570 --> 47:47.130]  and we're about to harvest all of that stuff pretty soon here. Johnny,
[47:47.130 --> 47:49.610]  you'll be there trimming it down Monday. Uh,
[47:49.650 --> 47:52.530]  I'm starting to get it figured out. I really like it. We've switched nutrients.
[47:53.010 --> 47:56.370]  Uh, we were using, it was proprietary. I wasn't allowed to say before,
[47:56.370 --> 47:59.410]  but since we switched, we were using a brand called MB first,
[47:59.810 --> 48:01.690]  which they send us just powders.
[48:01.690 --> 48:04.930]  And then we would make the nutrients with the water. We'd fucking, uh,
[48:05.410 --> 48:09.690]  did reconstitute. What's that? Yeah. Is it constant concentrate?
[48:09.890 --> 48:12.010]  They'd send us concentrate and then we'd fucking dilute it.
[48:12.010 --> 48:15.850]  I guess is what we were doing with hot water. Now we're using a veg bloom,
[48:15.850 --> 48:18.610]  the entire veg bloom line with a couple of other things mixed in.
[48:18.930 --> 48:21.850]  And I can see a huge difference from the veg bloom line.
[48:21.850 --> 48:25.210]  Those plants are beasted out. They're like a week ahead of the other plants.
[48:25.210 --> 48:28.250]  They look way fucking awesome. That's funny. I was going to ask you that,
[48:28.250 --> 48:31.170]  but I didn't know if you wanted to like talk about that on the podcast.
[48:32.330 --> 48:35.290]  I kind of go by what hunt says, what I can share and what I can't share.
[48:35.290 --> 48:37.490]  And since veg bloom helped us out quite a bit,
[48:37.890 --> 48:41.690]  I'm all about giving veg bloom a shout out. Plus I see huge results.
[48:41.690 --> 48:45.810]  I can already see, uh, there, there are three different sections of plants.
[48:45.810 --> 48:48.930]  So we're like week four and then about week six.
[48:48.930 --> 48:50.370]  And then there's another one that's fresh,
[48:50.770 --> 48:53.770]  but I can see looking at the veg bloom versus the MB first,
[48:53.770 --> 48:55.770]  the MB first plants are almost ready to get cut.
[48:56.050 --> 48:59.290]  The veg bloom plants are in week four and the buds are already as big as the
[48:59.290 --> 49:03.250]  final product on the MB first table. So veg bloom is killing it. Yeah,
[49:03.770 --> 49:08.450]  definitely crushing it. It's easy to mix. Uh, they send you just,
[49:08.730 --> 49:12.210]  uh, bags of powder. Basically it looks like you just got a bunch of cocaine
[49:12.210 --> 49:15.730]  delivered and then, uh, you weigh it, it goes by weight per gallon.
[49:15.730 --> 49:17.770]  And so I weigh out approximately,
[49:17.930 --> 49:22.370]  I think it's about 700 grams of the, each base.
[49:22.370 --> 49:24.890]  I've got two different bases, a hard water and a soft water.
[49:24.890 --> 49:28.890]  Cause our water is a certain condition. We mix them for the ideal results, uh,
[49:28.930 --> 49:31.650]  weigh out certain amounts on a scale and then just drop it in the water and give
[49:31.650 --> 49:33.770]  it a good stir. And it dissolves really quickly.
[49:33.770 --> 49:36.370]  It doesn't chunk up my filters too badly. Uh,
[49:36.410 --> 49:38.290]  it doesn't clog up my sprinkler system. So yeah,
[49:38.290 --> 49:41.210]  it seems to be working for what I'm doing. I like it. Nice. Yeah.
[49:41.490 --> 49:44.050]  I guess they just got a huge free fucking commercial from you. Didn't they?
[49:44.650 --> 49:47.370]  Shout out to our friends at random giggle was, I was like, wow,
[49:47.490 --> 49:50.690]  shout out to Vegflow. I like the product. I would use it. I'd recommend it.
[49:50.690 --> 49:53.650]  It's simple to use. There are four products. There's a base, uh,
[49:53.970 --> 49:57.530]  actually I have a full year product that I fucking hugely recommend the push.
[49:57.570 --> 50:00.850]  I think it is. Uh, they got a base, they've got shine,
[50:01.050 --> 50:03.650]  they've got life and they've got push and that's all you need.
[50:03.930 --> 50:07.010]  Those things will make your plant super happy and it's silly proof.
[50:07.050 --> 50:10.330]  You can't fuck it up. You can overdo it, but it's, it's silly proof.
[50:10.330 --> 50:12.730]  Other than that, I love it. Yep.
[50:12.850 --> 50:15.330]  We're going to pull our best harvest ever here pretty soon at green and healthy.
[50:15.530 --> 50:18.130]  I'm super stoked. Yeah, I bet you are. Cause you get to sell it.
[50:19.770 --> 50:23.050]  I am cause I get to consume some of it. Yes you do buddy.
[50:23.170 --> 50:25.010]  I was about to say smoke, but that, that,
[50:25.010 --> 50:26.930]  that really doesn't paint the full picture. Now does it?
[50:28.450 --> 50:30.850]  You get to dab it, you get to smoke it, you get to smell it.
[50:33.730 --> 50:35.490]  All right. That was an awkward giggle there.
[50:35.490 --> 50:39.610]  I think Lindsay's needs a dab.
[50:39.770 --> 50:41.930]  Yeah. I just reached for it. As you said that,
[50:42.770 --> 50:45.490]  Lindsay came over and rolled up a big old fat blunt and smoked that blunt to
[50:45.490 --> 50:49.890]  her face by herself. Wow. That is not even fair. I offered it.
[50:51.610 --> 50:56.610]  I was like, I know we jokingly told Mike that I like faced a blunt in front of
[50:56.810 --> 50:57.650]  you. I was like, well,
[50:57.650 --> 51:01.970]  we're not going to let people think that I was that rude that I just came over
[51:02.330 --> 51:05.810]  here. I'm not into your flavored blunt wraps, dude. No offense to you.
[51:07.130 --> 51:09.010]  No, you know what? I didn't even think about that.
[51:09.010 --> 51:11.770]  I forgot you didn't like them the last time. I would have brought different ones.
[51:11.770 --> 51:13.410]  I don't like to smoke a blunt period.
[51:13.410 --> 51:15.410]  Yeah. Well I knew you weren't going to smoke one anyways.
[51:15.410 --> 51:17.170]  Wrap incense around it and I'm not into it.
[51:19.570 --> 51:22.450]  It's what it tastes like to me. It tastes like strawberry incense. I can't,
[51:22.450 --> 51:24.410]  I can't deal with it. That's funny. I, uh,
[51:24.530 --> 51:28.810]  I had this epiphany the other day that cause I don't smoke cigarettes at all.
[51:28.850 --> 51:30.650]  I've never smoked cigarettes in my life,
[51:31.050 --> 51:35.410]  but I had this epiphany the other day that I'm actually addicted to nicotine
[51:35.410 --> 51:39.410]  because I smoke blunts. Actually, since I've been in Colorado,
[51:39.410 --> 51:41.050]  I smoke a lot less blunts.
[51:41.070 --> 51:46.070]  I smoke a lot more hash now that I'm out here because I have access to great
[51:46.730 --> 51:51.730]  hash. So I, you know, I'm not gonna dab poop soup in Florida.
[51:52.450 --> 51:57.290]  Shout out to poop soup in Florida. Um, you know who you are. Um,
[51:57.290 --> 52:00.730]  but uh, yeah. So yeah, so I like, you know, now that I'm here,
[52:00.730 --> 52:01.690]  I smoke a lot more hash.
[52:01.690 --> 52:05.170]  But I realized the other day that I might actually need to cut blunts out
[52:05.170 --> 52:07.570]  completely, which might really hurt me.
[52:07.610 --> 52:09.650]  You've been coughing quite a bit when you smoke a blunt.
[52:09.690 --> 52:11.410]  Yeah, it's been insane.
[52:11.410 --> 52:16.050]  So I'm just like maybe I might have to actually stop smoking blunts for a while.
[52:16.050 --> 52:19.330]  So I like the dabs. They're just more economical. It's more,
[52:19.570 --> 52:23.010]  just less puffs on my lungs. Like I feel like as a human,
[52:23.010 --> 52:26.810]  you probably get like a set of tires. You get so many miles on your lungs,
[52:26.810 --> 52:31.010]  you probably get so many ins and outs. And I feel like if I take 37,
[52:32.330 --> 52:33.170]  I was just talking to you,
[52:33.290 --> 52:35.650]  I've been staring right at her having a conversation with her for a minute.
[52:35.650 --> 52:36.490]  I thought I'd share with you.
[52:36.490 --> 52:40.650]  I agree with all of this. Um, I've been doing a lot of bonk hits lately.
[52:41.810 --> 52:43.090]  I've been thinking about this though,
[52:43.090 --> 52:46.210]  cause it is a little more expensive that way. Um,
[52:46.330 --> 52:48.370]  and it definitely eats up a lot more time.
[52:48.890 --> 52:53.890]  Yeah. Like imagine I consume a lot of hash and imagine how much hash,
[52:54.610 --> 52:58.250]  how much flour I would have to consume to reach that level that I get with
[52:58.330 --> 52:59.170]  smoking.
[52:59.170 --> 53:02.730]  I can honestly smoke a half a gram to a gram of hash just in one sitting while
[53:02.730 --> 53:03.570]  we're just chilling out.
[53:03.610 --> 53:07.570]  There's a bunch of conversations about potency taking place around the country
[53:07.570 --> 53:09.330]  right now. And that's part of it's,
[53:09.330 --> 53:12.250]  it's missing is the stuff that's 75,
[53:12.250 --> 53:17.050]  85% GHC that we have available to us here in Colorado. Uh,
[53:17.090 --> 53:21.210]  we're not smoking a two gram blunt of it. Um,
[53:21.970 --> 53:25.410]  now that I say that out loud, it sounds kind of fun. Um,
[53:25.650 --> 53:27.930]  but we're taking a tiny little dab.
[53:29.490 --> 53:33.730]  You're point point two of a gram about the average size of a dab around here.
[53:36.570 --> 53:39.730]  Yeah. It's so much smaller. It's so much quicker.
[53:42.930 --> 53:43.770]  I'm going to take one.
[53:44.010 --> 53:47.290]  But the show just say we all been taking dabs on this show just went super
[53:47.290 --> 53:49.650]  silent. So maybe it's time to start wrapping up the show.
[53:49.650 --> 53:51.890]  You guys maybe you can just wrap it up real quick and then I'll take a fat dab.
[53:53.490 --> 53:56.090]  Yeah. All right. You guys got any final words?
[53:57.530 --> 53:59.850]  Thanks for listening to everybody. This show is kind of bizarre.
[53:59.850 --> 54:00.690]  I think I like it.
[54:00.810 --> 54:03.690]  Yeah. Just, you know, when you come into dispensaries,
[54:03.690 --> 54:07.330]  just know what you're allowed to have, know what you're allowed to get. Um,
[54:07.770 --> 54:12.130]  you know, whether it's medical or recreational, know your limits,
[54:12.410 --> 54:16.210]  know what you're allowed to do as a patient and as a member, um,
[54:16.370 --> 54:20.170]  on the medical side, you know, don't come in and ask stupid questions.
[54:20.170 --> 54:22.210]  Don't say illegal things you're going to do, you know,
[54:22.650 --> 54:23.970]  the whole spiel from this time,
[54:23.970 --> 54:28.290]  but just really be conscious of yourself and the way you're portraying yourself.
[54:28.290 --> 54:30.970]  And, um, yeah,
[54:31.010 --> 54:34.810]  all of that just be more conscious of yourselves in the dispensaries guys.
[54:34.850 --> 54:37.610]  That dab just hit you, didn't it? Yeah. Cause I was just like, I could go,
[54:37.650 --> 54:40.090]  I could make this even longer. So like, I just need to stop.
[54:40.170 --> 54:43.650]  I was just impressed. We got a coherent wrap up again. I like it.
[54:44.130 --> 54:46.370]  Like a Jerry Springer's final thoughts is awesome.
[54:50.490 --> 54:53.210]  Oh gosh. I can't believe I've been with there. All right guys, it's that time.
[54:53.490 --> 54:56.570]  The podcast is wrapping up. So it'd be awesome. If you go to iTunes,
[54:56.570 --> 54:59.130]  go to the iTunes store, search for the growth from your heart podcast,
[55:00.090 --> 55:01.530]  find the review section, type in a comment,
[55:01.530 --> 55:03.410]  let me know what you think about the podcast and guess what?
[55:03.410 --> 55:05.490]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[55:05.490 --> 55:07.650]  There are probably a couple of hanging out there that I need to read soon.
[55:07.650 --> 55:11.090]  I will get to those. I promise you, uh, when you're typing in a comment, uh,
[55:11.090 --> 55:14.290]  click on some stars. Let me know what you think. I can get one to five stars.
[55:14.810 --> 55:17.210]  Be honest, click on as many as you think I deserve.
[55:17.490 --> 55:19.890]  I'm not going to pander for five, but you know, that's always what we want.
[55:19.890 --> 55:23.850]  Keep us up to a solid five star rating. That'd be cool. Uh, what else can you do?
[55:23.850 --> 55:27.090]  If you want to sponsor the show or if you've got a product you'd like to send me
[55:27.090 --> 55:30.330]  to review, if you send us a product, I will get the product in the mail.
[55:30.330 --> 55:32.170]  We will unbox it. I'll turn on the microphones.
[55:32.170 --> 55:34.490]  We won't do the whole podcast spiel, but I'll turn on the microphones.
[55:34.490 --> 55:37.610]  We'll sit at the table. Whoever's here with me. Oftentimes it's Mike.
[55:37.770 --> 55:40.770]  We'll unwrap a product. We'll talk about it as we unwrap it.
[55:40.770 --> 55:43.410]  We'll talk about how well it was packaged, what the packaging looks like,
[55:43.410 --> 55:46.450]  how appealing the packaging is. Uh, we will take the package out,
[55:46.450 --> 55:48.090]  the product out of the package. Uh,
[55:48.090 --> 55:50.370]  we'll read the instructions so we can figure out how to use the thing.
[55:50.610 --> 55:52.690]  We'll get it charged up. If we need to, we'll press pause.
[55:52.690 --> 55:55.650]  We'll go smoke on our own. Once the thing's charged up, we'll come back.
[55:55.890 --> 55:58.250]  We'll use the device, whatever kind of toy you send us,
[55:58.250 --> 56:00.770]  whatever you'd like reviewed, but something to smoke down.
[56:00.770 --> 56:03.370]  Now it's got a charger. Well, I mean, you know, vaping,
[56:03.370 --> 56:06.050]  that's what I liked about the furniture table that was plug and play.
[56:06.810 --> 56:09.690]  The Bernard table was a five star review all the way around.
[56:09.690 --> 56:10.690]  That thing's amazing.
[56:10.690 --> 56:12.690]  Shout out to Chris Bobo.
[56:12.690 --> 56:16.330]  Yeah. Uh, Chris, come home soon, bro. We miss you. Yes. Um,
[56:16.490 --> 56:19.610]  but if you've got a product, we, we will do your product justice. Um,
[56:19.850 --> 56:23.330]  we'll send it to a legit review. The better the product, the better the review.
[56:23.370 --> 56:26.250]  We'll check it out. We'll put it to use. I'm a smart dude.
[56:26.250 --> 56:27.170]  I know how to use products.
[56:27.170 --> 56:30.010]  I know how to set the settings to where they need to be for my comfort level.
[56:30.010 --> 56:32.730]  And we'll get it figured out and we'll use it. If you need it back, let me know.
[56:32.730 --> 56:35.490]  We'll ship the damn thing back to you. If it's a product that can be shipped back,
[56:35.970 --> 56:37.730]  uh, we'll take care of you. So if you've got a product you'd like,
[56:38.250 --> 56:42.130]  like us to review, um, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[56:42.130 --> 56:44.050]  We'd love to check out your toys, your inventions,
[56:44.050 --> 56:45.570]  whatever you need put out there on the market.
[56:45.930 --> 56:49.690]  A lot of people will hear about your product. Mike and I, maybe Lindsay,
[56:49.690 --> 56:53.010]  whoever else is hanging out, we'll check it out. We'll see what's going on.
[56:53.010 --> 56:56.010]  I'm afraid to number of people with this. We do hit a lot of people.
[56:56.010 --> 56:58.570]  I don't even like to talk about how many people we reach when I have guests
[56:58.570 --> 57:00.890]  here. Cause it kind of freaks you guys out. Sometimes you go silent,
[57:00.890 --> 57:01.730]  you get all pale.
[57:01.890 --> 57:04.970]  Well, I just, this week, uh, in particular,
[57:04.970 --> 57:08.690]  I got some feedback from a listener that mentioned that the last week was as
[57:08.690 --> 57:11.290]  high as they'd ever heard me. And I was like, ha, we topped it up.
[57:11.290 --> 57:14.970]  So nice to say shout out to set, just to listen and Ross to set.
[57:14.970 --> 57:16.810]  We appreciate it. Shout out to Fred Garvin,
[57:16.810 --> 57:19.050]  shout out to everybody that listens to the podcast. We appreciate it.
[57:19.050 --> 57:21.370]  It's really rad. I like all the interaction, all the support.
[57:21.370 --> 57:24.210]  I've been getting tons more emails and messages.
[57:24.210 --> 57:26.690]  And I think a lot of it is because we are now on Tok radio.
[57:26.690 --> 57:30.170]  So I think people are tuning into Tok radio and discovering the podcast there.
[57:30.170 --> 57:33.810]  Cause I'm finding totally new people in my inbox that I've never listened to.
[57:34.130 --> 57:37.850]  I just discovered there's a whole nother fucking inbox on my Facebook account.
[57:37.850 --> 57:40.330]  I've got three inboxes. What the fuck? There's like the request.
[57:40.330 --> 57:44.370]  One is another one to like the filtered one or something that I've never seen.
[57:44.730 --> 57:47.250]  So yeah, you have to show me that black hole.
[57:47.290 --> 57:49.570]  I don't even know how it popped up. I can't find it again.
[57:49.570 --> 57:52.010]  So I feel like I need to go on my computer and open up Facebook.
[57:52.010 --> 57:53.090]  I took a screenshot to be like,
[57:53.090 --> 57:55.610]  where did this come from so that I could try to find it when I had more time to
[57:55.690 --> 57:59.970]  surf. But yeah. So if you have sent me a Facebook message at my personal account,
[57:59.970 --> 58:03.050]  I apologize that I haven't gotten back to you. I don't suck that bad at life.
[58:03.770 --> 58:05.730]  Somebody bitched at me for not getting back to them right away.
[58:05.930 --> 58:08.250]  I get no shit 25 to 50,
[58:08.250 --> 58:12.730]  maybe a hundred Facebook messages and emails a day and it's hard to get to all
[58:12.750 --> 58:13.050]  of them.
[58:13.050 --> 58:17.090]  So there'll be a random day of the week when I have maybe 10 or 20 minutes to
[58:17.090 --> 58:18.770]  chill out. I'm eating lunch, eating a sandwich,
[58:18.770 --> 58:21.050]  and I'll reply to six emails right then boom, boom, boom, boom.
[58:21.050 --> 58:23.850]  As quickly as I can. And those are the six that I got.
[58:23.850 --> 58:26.290]  And then I'll get the next six next time. Cause I mean,
[58:26.690 --> 58:30.930]  I had a lot of shit going on. Sometimes it's hard. That's my rant on that.
[58:31.090 --> 58:33.930]  So yeah. Send me an email, growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[58:34.330 --> 58:36.370]  We'll review your products. That's where I was with all that.
[58:36.410 --> 58:38.890]  I don't even have notes in front of me and I had a little land back on the map.
[58:39.370 --> 58:42.530]  Uh, what else do we got? Any announcements or anything? You guys elevate.
[58:42.530 --> 58:44.770]  That's what's important. Elevate. If you need glass,
[58:44.770 --> 58:47.090]  if you need smoking accessories, if you want to see cool glass,
[58:47.090 --> 58:50.290]  you don't have to buy shit. They're a glass gallery. You can go take a look.
[58:50.290 --> 58:54.250]  They will not be mad at you for looking and not buying and go see Inky the dog.
[58:54.250 --> 58:56.290]  Inky's a sweet puppy. Go give him a scratch on the forehead.
[58:56.290 --> 58:58.090]  Now he's probably afraid of you. He'll run from you.
[58:58.130 --> 59:01.090]  I'm so tall. He's scared shitless of me, but to go in there, see Inky,
[59:01.090 --> 59:03.570]  go see all the lovely ladies. Go tell him what's up. Elevate glass,
[59:03.770 --> 59:05.450]  517 South day home. Check it out.
[59:05.450 --> 59:09.810]  If you're on take home and you want to park and it's all crowded on Tahoe and
[59:09.810 --> 59:12.490]  you don't have money for the meter, fuck it. Turn left or right on Moreno.
[59:12.490 --> 59:16.210]  I think it's either Monterey or Moreno starts with an M right there.
[59:16.250 --> 59:19.490]  Free parking. Boom. Don't pay for parking. Why would you do that?
[59:19.530 --> 59:22.570]  Just go park for free. Like there's that bar across the street.
[59:22.570 --> 59:25.290]  It's got a live band. It's always all crowded. It's hard to park right there.
[59:25.330 --> 59:28.290]  Don't hit the meters. Just turn left or turn right after you pass the place.
[59:28.290 --> 59:31.690]  You'll be cool. It's all legit. Sunshiny out. Go take a little walk.
[59:32.970 --> 59:36.210]  I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but Hey, save some money.
[59:36.410 --> 59:38.890]  What would Joey DSA take a risk? Columbus did
[59:41.490 --> 59:43.410]  you guys? That's all the podcast we've got for you this week.
[59:43.410 --> 59:45.450]  I want to thank my friends for coming and hanging out with me for a couple
[59:45.450 --> 59:46.090]  hours.
[59:46.090 --> 59:48.970]  I felt a little bit shitty the past couple of days and some good vibes with some
[59:48.970 --> 59:50.210]  good friends will definitely cheer you up,
[59:50.250 --> 59:52.770]  make you forget that you didn't feel good. So thanks for coming guys.
[59:53.050 --> 59:54.930]  Yeah. Take some vitamins. Don't get sick.
[59:55.730 --> 59:59.410]  I might've wanted to say that before he came over, but uh,
[59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.210]  might have to check that orange juice in my fridge. Now, Jeff,
[01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.690]  there you go. It's everybody out there. Uh, take some vitamins,
[01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.930]  take good care of yourself. Fucking hydrate this summer. You guys,
[01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:10.370]  if you're at a festival raging, uh, beer is not hydration.
[01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:13.450]  No Dr. Pepper is not hydration. Mike, I hate to break it to you, dude.
[01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.290]  Mountain dew will not hydrate you. That will keep you diabetes.
[01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:20.650]  And make you sweaty. Drink water. It's good for you. Hydrate yourself,
[01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.570]  hydrate your plants, take good care of yourself. You're out there in the sunshine.
[01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:29.090]  Love yourself. It's been special hot lately. I hope y'all are staying cool.
[01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.890]  Especially outdoor growers. Shout out to all the outdoor farmers.
[01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.450]  They're out there getting burnt as shit.
[01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:37.170]  If you're out working outdoors right now, man, God bless you.
[01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:40.570]  I'm spoiled. I'm in a big indoor facility. It's 74 degrees all the time.
[01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.970]  It's super hot. When I go to lunch,
[01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.650]  it's pretty hot between the facility and when the air conditioner starts kicking
[01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.090]  in my car, that's pretty much the same struggle.
[01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:49.770]  Mike's got pretty much the same thing.
[01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.970]  Yeah, we, uh, it was like 83 for a minute in the bedroom.
[01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:58.290]  The other day at work, it was like 105 outside. Um, and it just,
[01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:02.010]  it took a minute to get the AC powered up enough to cool it down and hollow.
[01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:02.850]  Holy hell.
[01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:08.290]  I haven't had to use the go outside and really bake yourself so that to make it
[01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.090]  tolerable inside for the next half hour trick in a while.
[01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:14.490]  And I had to break that one out again this week. Yep.
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.010]  That's serious. Yeah.
[01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:21.290]  All right guys. We just got real deep and serious.
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.970]  I almost feel like we should do something fun right now.
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.090]  Like a sticker pack thing.
[01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:28.370]  That's just real easy to do for the like the two people that are still listening.
[01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.650]  You got some stickers to donate?
[01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.490]  No, but I got like $4 so that y'all can pick some up.
[01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.210]  No, we can, we can give out. What do you, what's,
[01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:36.010]  what kind of prize do you want to offer on this episode?
[01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.250]  I totally have mad stuff. So,
[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:39.530]  well I've got sticker packs.
[01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.930]  I have plenty of stuff I can throw into this too.
[01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.730]  Actually I do have a stack of stickers I could throw.
[01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.690]  Let's make some rules. What do people have to do, bro?
[01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:49.210]  Cause we've gone an hour and five minutes and if they're still listening,
[01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.490]  they're dedicated listeners.
[01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.690]  Tweet all three of us.
[01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:53.530]  All right. Tweet all three of us.
[01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.530]  Yep.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.370]  What else?
[01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:56.290]  That's it.
[01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.370]  What do they have to tweet us?
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:58.730]  Uh,
[01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:01.290]  they can make one tweet,
[01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:05.010]  uh, one tweet tag us all three, the traveling stoner.
[01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:06.930]  No, the travel stoner.
[01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:07.930]  The travel stoner.
[01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:11.170]  The travel stoner. We didn't even let you guys do your plugs. I'm sorry.
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:15.090]  The travel stoner, Nemo punk 15. Yep. And uh,
[01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:17.610]  at GFYH podcast, you can't tag my personal one.
[01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.930]  You got to follow the instructions at GFYH podcast. I'm writing that down.
[01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.490]  I'm going to remember that.
[01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.370]  I'm going to be behind. Forget. Uh, you got to tweet all three of us,
[01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:30.250]  the travel stoner Nemo punk 15 at GFYH podcast. Tweet us.
[01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.290]  What are you going to tweet us?
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:34.450]  Should we ask a question in the first person who answers? Um,
[01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:35.930]  I guess there's not really a first person, right?
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:37.930]  There's just like one that will be listening.
[01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.410]  It's just a guess. Okay, cool.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.770]  This kind of went everywhere and I feel like we've lost the people that were
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.050]  like, well, I'm looking for a dedicated show about growing. Nope. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:50.850]  A lot of people have tuned out. I think the people that like when we ramble are still here.
[01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:55.890]  The first one to say hashtag, I like it when you ramble, right?
[01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:59.570]  Hasn't this been just one, but they got to tweet all three of us. Yeah. Do it.
[01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.770]  All right. Again, you guys hashtag. I like it when you ramble.
[01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.730]  It'd be a nice sticker pack. You got to get all three of us. And then just,
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.610]  you could, you could, you could say something in the message also,
[01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:12.090]  if you'd like to like send me some fucking stickers, bro, something like that.
[01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:15.050]  It'd be cool. You know, and we will get some stickers out and this,
[01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.850]  we'll have to put an expiration date on this.
[01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:21.810]  This episode is going to come out around the 1st of July.
[01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:26.210]  So this ends August 15th, August 15th. This will be over.
[01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.090]  Yeah. August 15th. You guys got to August 15th.
[01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.970]  I just have to put an expiration date on shit because I forget that this is a
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:34.930]  podcast for you forever. I want to do, I want to give you a shot.
[01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:38.810]  Mike just put work into the podcast. You just made me have to do shit now.
[01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.290]  Right? It's okay. I'll send it out. If you just tell me who it is.
[01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:44.530]  I'm just kidding. It's easy, but I like Mike's a Mike's.
[01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:49.490]  What's that ingenuity. Yep. It's not the word I'm looking for. Nope. Nope.
[01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.290]  It's the word when you just do stuff on your own initiative. Mike's got it.
[01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.970]  Mike took initiative here. All right guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:58.650]  We've been going for so long. If you're listening to the show still,
[01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:01.850]  I love you. I love you. You gotta be our friends or something.
[01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.610]  You're listening for a reason. Uh, I've got some other episodes planned.
[01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.810]  This wasn't even really a, this was just happened today. So it was kind of rad.
[01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:12.450]  Uh, I've got some other episodes planned that are not quite so rambly. Uh,
[01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.530]  I promise. Yeah. And if you want us,
[01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.810]  if you'd like us to do a show on a specific topic, by all means, email, uh,
[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.450]  you've got the email by now, email and whatever.
[01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:24.090]  Roll from your heart at hotmail.com. Yeah. Thank you.
[01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:27.490]  I don't know why I keep losing that email address tonight. Yeah.
[01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.970]  Email us your topic and we'll put together a good show.
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.170]  I've got a bunch of good emails. Yeah. Well, yeah,
[01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.930]  I'll kick these guys out and do another show with Adam.
[01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:38.770]  You guys will put that out also. That was my bad. Nobody's bad at all.
[01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.050]  This is a great fucking podcast. I appreciate you guys for coming.
[01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:42.850]  And nobody's bad at all. This is rad.
[01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:47.490]  The hilarious part is I put the heavy hitter in the fridge for afterwards.
[01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.250]  So we wouldn't get to a stone before the podcast.
[01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.010]  You've got ice hash in the fridge. Oh,
[01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.290]  so that's why I was like,
[01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.170]  that's why I was laughing so hard that we got so high off this live.
[01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.330]  We're going to press out some solventless dabs when we wrap this podcast up.
[01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.010]  Hey guys, I gotta go. We got some shit to do.
[01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.250]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:09.250]  Chris said, we're not allowed to smoke at all. That was his one.
[01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.770]  I know. Sorry, Bobo. Chris, you've been in Portugal.
[01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:16.250]  So he's in Florida now. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.370]  He went to Portugal and Florida. Florida's,
[01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.490]  Florida's got some beautiful things. Portugal's got some beautiful things.
[01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.770]  Smoke that sand. Yeah, bro. You can't tell us.
[01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:27.770]  Yeah, bro. You can't tell us what we can't do. Come on, bro.
[01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.170]  We'll get you some more beach sand hash. No worries.
[01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:32.170]  Everybody, thank you for listening this far. I totally appreciate it.
[01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.170]  It was fun hanging out with you.
[01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.170]  I hope you got some insight into our lives.
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:36.170]  I hope you learned something about hanging out in dispensaries.
[01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.170]  I hope you learned that we got stupid high and we like,
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.170]  like it when we ran.
[01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:43.170]  I thought I knew where I was going with that,
[01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.170]  but I couldn't get there.
[01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:46.170]  We love you guys. Thanks for listening.
[01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:48.170]  Absolutely. That's it. All of that.
[01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:49.170]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.170]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug.
[01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.170]  Bye.
[01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.170]  I'll be the same.
[01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:35.570]  Won't be the same.
[01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.570]  I can't.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040]  I never.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:58.000]  Won't be the same.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Won't be the same.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]  Silhouette expression.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920]  In a flash of sideways.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]  Cheese and kill.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920]  Let's sing a little.
[01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.590]  I'm going to summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield.
[01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:40.590]  In the morning, this old world won't be the same.
[01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.590]  We're going to summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield.
[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.590]  In the morning, this old world won't be the same.
[01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:52.590]  Won't be the same.
[01:07:54.590 --> 01:08:44.960]  Stop feeling weak.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960]  In the evening, I'll be the hot sun.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960]  Crawling to the station.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.960]  We were foaming at the mound.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.960]  Sipping on a tall boy.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960]  Sipping on a tall boy.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:05.440]  Just looking for a place to swell.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.440]  Going to summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.630]  Won't be the same.
[01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:18.630]  Going to summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield.
[01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:22.630]  In the morning, this old world won't be the same.
[01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:23.630]  Won't be the same.
[01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:28.630]  We're going to summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield.
