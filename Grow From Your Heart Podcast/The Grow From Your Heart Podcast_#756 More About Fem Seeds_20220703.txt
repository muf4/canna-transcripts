[00:11.070 --> 00:12.890]  Alright, here we go.
[00:12.890 --> 00:14.150]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:14.150 --> 00:15.150]  I'm your host.
[00:15.150 --> 00:16.550]  My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:16.550 --> 00:21.470]  This is episode 756 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.470 --> 00:24.070]  I'm coming to you on a super hot Colorado day.
[00:24.070 --> 00:26.630]  I've got a great episode lined up for you.
[00:26.630 --> 00:30.590]  Before we get to the main topic of today's show, I should do an update from a previous
[00:30.590 --> 00:31.590]  episode.
[00:31.590 --> 00:34.990]  In the last episode, I talked a lot about pests and pest management.
[00:34.990 --> 00:38.850]  Today I was actually at the grow store grabbing some supplies, and I thought that I should
[00:38.850 --> 00:43.750]  warn you that one of the most common places for you to get bugs is that grow store.
[00:43.750 --> 00:47.210]  Anything that comes from that grow store may possibly be carrying spider mites.
[00:47.210 --> 00:48.210]  It could have thrips.
[00:48.210 --> 00:49.210]  It could have aphids.
[00:49.210 --> 00:50.650]  It could have bad shit on it.
[00:50.650 --> 00:55.450]  Also, anytime you go to the dispensary, keep in mind a lot of growers and smokers and consumers
[00:55.450 --> 00:57.570]  are there, you're risking spider mites.
[00:57.570 --> 01:01.930]  Also, anytime you go to your friend's place that does grow, you are risking spider mites.
[01:01.930 --> 01:05.430]  If you're in a friend's car that grows, if your friend that grows comes to your place,
[01:05.430 --> 01:08.210]  you are also risking a spider mite infestation.
[01:08.210 --> 01:12.850]  As I was at the grow store today, I realized I failed to mention those things.
[01:12.850 --> 01:16.110]  Thought that I would throw that in there, remind you there are a lot of other options
[01:16.110 --> 01:20.530]  for getting bugs, not just the only places, not only the places I mentioned, but also
[01:20.530 --> 01:22.770]  the grow store, the dispensary.
[01:22.770 --> 01:26.130]  If you take your date to the botanical garden, if you go out to the park, if you go on a
[01:26.130 --> 01:29.650]  hike, those are all potential places for spider mites.
[01:29.650 --> 01:30.650]  All right.
[01:30.650 --> 01:34.130]  I feel like I left that out, wanted to catch up, get that in here at the start of the show.
[01:34.130 --> 01:37.250]  Before we get much further, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who
[01:37.250 --> 01:39.530]  do support the show on Patreon.
[01:39.530 --> 01:42.010]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:49.250 --> 01:51.530]  Let's send a big thank you to Green Country Grower.
[01:51.530 --> 01:55.230]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Canna Organic Illinois.
[01:55.230 --> 01:57.890]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Lefty's Farm.
[01:57.890 --> 02:00.190]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Gramps Memo.
[02:00.190 --> 02:02.690]  Let's send a big thank you to Pack Northwest Dan.

[02:06.810 --> 02:10.570]  And let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[02:10.570 --> 02:13.030]  to NorthEast420.
[02:13.030 --> 02:17.790]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[02:21.330 --> 02:27.570]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:27.570 --> 02:30.350]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:30.350 --> 02:34.870]  And you know, I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[02:34.870 --> 02:40.230]  it nice and easy for all of my friends to support the podcast.
[02:40.230 --> 02:44.910]  This episode will come out on July 3rd, 2022.
[02:44.910 --> 02:50.150]  That means that we are in the middle of a 4th of July sale on the iRedirect website.
[02:50.150 --> 02:51.150]  That's right.
[02:51.150 --> 02:56.750]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, iRegenetics.com, there's a tab that says iRedirect.
[02:56.750 --> 02:58.390]  Click on the iRedirect tab.
[02:58.390 --> 03:02.430]  There is a sale going on where you can get some great beans at some great prices.
[03:02.430 --> 03:05.410]  Go now, check the live inventory, see what is there.
[03:05.410 --> 03:07.390]  Get what you can because things will sell out.
[03:07.390 --> 03:09.410]  That sale did start on Friday at midnight.
[03:09.410 --> 03:11.890]  That will go until the end of the 4th of July.
[03:11.890 --> 03:15.030]  So basically the 4th of July at 1159 PM.
[03:15.030 --> 03:16.030]  That's when it ends on the 5th.
[03:16.030 --> 03:17.410]  It is all over.
[03:17.410 --> 03:19.350]  Things go back to regular price.
[03:19.350 --> 03:22.010]  Most of the good shit will be sold out by then.
[03:22.010 --> 03:23.290]  That's enough advertising.
[03:23.290 --> 03:25.670]  Let's get into this podcast here.
[03:25.670 --> 03:28.950]  I do have a great question that came from the YouTube channel.
[03:28.950 --> 03:32.270]  I usually don't answer questions from YouTube, but somebody sent me this and they said this
[03:32.270 --> 03:33.590]  would be great for the show.
[03:33.590 --> 03:34.590]  I agree.
[03:34.590 --> 03:40.870]  It says, can you touch on stabilizing feminized reversals on a future episode?
[03:40.870 --> 03:45.110]  So I think what you're asking is if I can basically talk about making and stabilizing
[03:45.110 --> 03:46.510]  feminized seeds.
[03:46.510 --> 03:50.230]  So let's talk about making fem seeds, then we'll kind of jump into the stabilization
[03:50.230 --> 03:51.790]  part of the question.
[03:51.790 --> 03:54.510]  What does he mean by feminized reversals?
[03:54.510 --> 04:00.150]  Feminized reversals is making fem seeds, using a reversed plant to make feminized seeds.
[04:00.150 --> 04:02.710]  I'll tell you how I do that.
[04:02.710 --> 04:06.510]  I very carefully, and we'll touch more on this in the part of the episode here, I very
[04:06.510 --> 04:11.950]  carefully select a female plant that I will choose to make a pollen donor.
[04:11.950 --> 04:12.950]  That's right.
[04:12.950 --> 04:15.470]  I said that a female plant will be treated with a solution.
[04:15.470 --> 04:18.470]  I make my own silver thiosulfate solution.
[04:18.470 --> 04:22.990]  Then I treat that female plant at a certain dilution at certain intervals on a very tight
[04:22.990 --> 04:23.990]  schedule.
[04:23.990 --> 04:26.130]  It will get sprayed with that silver thiosulfate.
[04:26.130 --> 04:29.230]  That female plant will then create pollen sacks.
[04:29.310 --> 04:33.550]  That pollen will only contain female chromosomes because the plant that I have selected is
[04:33.550 --> 04:35.070]  purely female.
[04:35.070 --> 04:36.830]  So we'll pass female chromosomes.
[04:36.830 --> 04:41.710]  I then take that female pollen and put that on another female plant.
[04:41.710 --> 04:45.790]  Now all of the seeds that come from that female plant that received the pollen will be female
[04:45.790 --> 04:50.470]  seeds because I have not introduced any male chromosomes into the equation.
[04:50.470 --> 04:52.850]  So that is making feminized seeds.
[04:52.850 --> 04:54.190]  They said feminized reversals.
[04:54.190 --> 04:56.950]  It comes from a reversal to make the feminized seeds.
[04:56.950 --> 05:02.470]  So now they want to talk about the word they chose here is stabilizing feminized seeds.
[05:02.470 --> 05:06.910]  That's where this gets fun because the word stabilization gets kind of tossed around in
[05:06.910 --> 05:10.790]  the cannabis community in a lot of weird ways.
[05:10.790 --> 05:14.830]  Stabilization doesn't only necessarily refer to sexual stability.
[05:14.830 --> 05:16.110]  That is a thing.
[05:16.110 --> 05:23.510]  But stabilization more refers to, in the agricultural world, stabilization more refers to uniformity
[05:23.510 --> 05:24.870]  amongst phenotypes.
[05:24.870 --> 05:29.030]  So if we threw out a hundred seeds, we shouldn't see a hundred different phenotypes.
[05:29.030 --> 05:33.910]  We should hopefully, if we've done the stabilization the way that agriculture, big ag likes it,
[05:33.910 --> 05:36.310]  you're going to see one, maybe two phenotypes.
[05:36.310 --> 05:39.550]  If you go look in a cornfield, if you look in a soy field, a big field that's run by
[05:39.550 --> 05:43.350]  commercial farmers, all of those phenotypes, all that corn looks the same.
[05:43.350 --> 05:45.110]  They didn't grow clones of the corn.
[05:45.110 --> 05:46.150]  They've got it narrowed down.
[05:46.150 --> 05:47.150]  That's GMO corn.
[05:47.150 --> 05:51.370]  So it's kind of they're cheating, but they've got that corn figured out to where every seed
[05:51.370 --> 05:52.470]  looks the same.
[05:52.470 --> 05:54.090]  That is stabilization.
[05:54.090 --> 05:55.570]  Those seeds are stable.
[05:55.570 --> 06:00.170]  Every time I grow this corn in this part of the country, in this location, it will get
[06:00.170 --> 06:01.170]  three feet tall.
[06:01.170 --> 06:02.170]  Then it will begin to flower.
[06:02.170 --> 06:03.690]  It will take this many weeks to flower.
[06:03.690 --> 06:05.590]  It will take this much nitrogen.
[06:05.590 --> 06:07.170]  They've got that fucking seed dialed in.
[06:07.170 --> 06:11.010]  That is stabilization amongst the agricultural environment.
[06:11.010 --> 06:12.890]  That's what stabilization refers to.
[06:12.890 --> 06:16.690]  A lot of times when people say stable in cannabis, they say that's not stable.
[06:16.690 --> 06:21.530]  They're only referring to sexual stability, meaning that some of the feminized seeds will
[06:21.530 --> 06:26.650]  show intersex traits or also the regular seeds will show intersex traits.
[06:26.650 --> 06:28.970]  That is oftentimes what people mean by stability.
[06:28.970 --> 06:37.970]  So I'm going to talk more about stabilizing them for the phenotype because in my opinion,
[06:37.970 --> 06:44.470]  if the proper plants were selected to make feminized seeds, that is where the stabilization
[06:44.470 --> 06:48.530]  happens for making the sexual stability.
[06:48.530 --> 06:52.850]  If both of the plants that you have chosen to work with to make female seeds are true
[06:52.850 --> 06:59.690]  females and do not contain intersex traits, then you can definitely make stable female
[06:59.690 --> 07:00.690]  plants from there.
[07:00.690 --> 07:01.690]  But it's all about the selection.
[07:01.690 --> 07:06.530]  If you don't do rigorous testing and careful selection, then it is going to be really hard
[07:06.530 --> 07:11.130]  to stabilize your feminized crosses sexually if you've done the proper work.
[07:11.130 --> 07:12.810]  So let's talk about doing the proper work.
[07:12.810 --> 07:14.250]  What do I mean?
[07:14.250 --> 07:17.570]  To find out if a female is a true female, you've got to give it some tests.
[07:17.610 --> 07:24.850]  Now, almost every cannabis plant eventually, there's some way to make that plant show you
[07:24.850 --> 07:25.850]  intersex traits.
[07:25.850 --> 07:28.050]  There's some way to make that plant produce a seed.
[07:28.050 --> 07:32.370]  But under most conditions, under a lot of stress, most of the plants I'm working with
[07:32.370 --> 07:35.210]  will not show us intersex traits.
[07:35.210 --> 07:40.130]  So I will do things like put a female plant into flower for 12 or 14 days.
[07:40.130 --> 07:44.090]  As soon as she shows me I'm a female, I'm in flower, guess what I do?
[07:44.090 --> 07:45.530]  Put it back to another time.
[07:45.530 --> 07:49.090]  Just change it to 18, 6, 19, 5, 24 and 0.
[07:49.090 --> 07:50.310]  Just change that timer.
[07:50.310 --> 07:51.310]  See what it does.
[07:51.310 --> 07:55.490]  Then in like 10 days, we'll put it back on 12, 12 and see what that plant does.
[07:55.490 --> 07:56.490]  Does it freak out?
[07:56.490 --> 07:57.490]  Does it do weird shit?
[07:57.490 --> 07:58.490]  Does it crinkle up?
[07:58.490 --> 07:59.490]  Does it die?
[07:59.490 --> 08:00.490]  Do the leaves start curling?
[08:00.490 --> 08:01.490]  Does it get the claw?
[08:01.490 --> 08:02.890]  Does it get the sunshine finger?
[08:02.890 --> 08:03.890]  What does it do?
[08:03.890 --> 08:05.690]  Does it show me intersex traits?
[08:05.690 --> 08:06.810]  I pay attention to that.
[08:06.810 --> 08:08.770]  I do that to every plant that I breed with.
[08:08.770 --> 08:10.770]  I love to stress the shit out of them.
[08:10.770 --> 08:14.650]  I also give those plants to friends of mine who I know are going to abuse these plants.
[08:14.770 --> 08:16.770]  They're not as good of a grower as a lot of people.
[08:16.770 --> 08:17.930]  They make a lot of mistakes.
[08:17.930 --> 08:21.770]  Those are the people that will find out if that plant's going to give me problems.
[08:21.770 --> 08:27.370]  So before I choose to breed with anything, if I'm making regular seeds or feminized seeds,
[08:27.370 --> 08:33.130]  I will stress test my plants rigorously, very, very vigorous and rigorously.
[08:33.130 --> 08:34.330]  I will overfeed them.
[08:34.330 --> 08:35.370]  I will underfeed them.
[08:35.370 --> 08:36.610]  I'll mess with the light cycle.
[08:36.610 --> 08:37.730]  I'll give them too much heat.
[08:37.730 --> 08:39.690]  I'll give them too much cold.
[08:39.690 --> 08:43.530]  If those plants show me any sign of intersex traits, guess what?
[08:43.530 --> 08:44.530]  No breeding.
[08:44.530 --> 08:45.530]  I'm not going to go in the breeding room.
[08:45.530 --> 08:46.530]  I may grow it.
[08:46.530 --> 08:47.530]  I may keep it.
[08:47.530 --> 08:51.890]  I may breed it for myself to other plants to keep it for myself, but it will not make
[08:51.890 --> 08:56.250]  it to the production line for you guys to ever purchase, ever grow.
[08:56.250 --> 08:57.250]  Those are for me.
[08:57.250 --> 09:02.610]  So I will do a test on every plant, the pollen donor and the pollen receiver before I ever
[09:02.610 --> 09:05.250]  think about doing a feminized reversal.
[09:05.250 --> 09:10.650]  Now the people say that fem seeds are made from an intersex plant, that it's a, you're
[09:10.650 --> 09:11.970]  making the plant hermaphrodite.
[09:11.970 --> 09:13.530]  No, that is very wrong.
[09:13.530 --> 09:14.530]  That is not accurate.
[09:14.530 --> 09:16.690]  Stop saying that.
[09:16.690 --> 09:21.210]  The word hermaphrodite and feminized seeds should not be in the same mix at all.
[09:21.210 --> 09:25.570]  If you breed with intersex plants, you create more intersex plants.
[09:25.570 --> 09:29.330]  So to get stabilized, feminized crosses, I'm going backwards here.
[09:29.330 --> 09:33.530]  The way to do it is to start with stable female genetics.
[09:33.530 --> 09:37.970]  And yes, you can use a feminized female plant and a feminized female plant, and you can
[09:37.970 --> 09:41.930]  reverse one and pollinate the other and make more female plants that way.
[09:41.930 --> 09:42.930]  Yes, you can.
[09:42.930 --> 09:43.930]  Don't worry that one's female.
[09:43.930 --> 09:46.090]  Don't worry that one's not female or feminized.
[09:46.090 --> 09:48.890]  I mean, you can breed with the fems just like the regs.
[09:48.890 --> 09:54.530]  The only difference is there was no male chromosome involved in that breeding project.
[09:54.530 --> 09:58.410]  Now that we've kind of touched base on the differences between sexual stability and actual
[09:58.410 --> 10:03.250]  phenotypical stability, let's talk a little bit about making feminized seeds and some
[10:03.250 --> 10:05.730]  of the, uh, the traits I see in these plants.
[10:05.730 --> 10:09.770]  Let's talk a little bit about the, the stability, if you will, of these plants.
[10:09.770 --> 10:13.490]  There are two different options when we're making feminized seeds.
[10:13.490 --> 10:17.510]  We've got what are known as an S1 or I guess there are more options, but what we're going
[10:17.510 --> 10:20.430]  to start with are the S1 and the R1.
[10:20.430 --> 10:23.890]  The other options are basically going to be filial generations with different higher numbers
[10:23.890 --> 10:24.890]  at the end.
[10:24.890 --> 10:27.170]  But for now, we're going to focus on the two.
[10:27.170 --> 10:31.610]  We're going to focus on S and R. S stands for self.
[10:31.610 --> 10:36.410]  Let's just say we took a golden goat female and another golden goat female, and I reversed
[10:36.410 --> 10:39.850]  one golden goat and put the pollen onto the other golden goat.
[10:39.850 --> 10:41.650]  I have just made S1.
[10:41.650 --> 10:42.650]  Those are selfed seeds.
[10:42.650 --> 10:45.210]  It's a golden goat that fucked itself.
[10:45.210 --> 10:46.610]  You'll never forget that.
[10:46.610 --> 10:48.050]  That golden goat fucked itself.
[10:48.050 --> 10:49.410]  Those are self seeds.
[10:49.410 --> 10:54.290]  The seeds that come out of that are going to be pure golden goat feminized seeds.
[10:54.290 --> 10:55.690]  That is an S1.
[10:55.690 --> 10:57.210]  It's selfed itself.
[10:57.210 --> 11:02.470]  Now the other option is an R, an R1, a reversal of the first generation.
[11:02.470 --> 11:07.870]  So an R would be if I took that golden goat plant and reversed it, but if I put that pollen
[11:07.870 --> 11:12.910]  on any other female plant, the seeds that come from that are an R1.
[11:12.910 --> 11:16.150]  That's a reversal one, a first generation reversal.
[11:16.150 --> 11:17.610]  It is also an F1.
[11:17.610 --> 11:20.110]  That does qualify as an F1.
[11:20.110 --> 11:26.170]  But in the cannabis space, in the marketing, the labeling realm, on the websites of buying
[11:26.170 --> 11:29.770]  and selling seeds, people like to know if they're getting FEMs or regs.
[11:29.770 --> 11:33.610]  One way to clearly indicate that is to put that that is an R1.
[11:33.610 --> 11:38.850]  That's a reversal, a first generation reversal, the first filial generation of a reversal.
[11:38.850 --> 11:44.570]  So if you put that pollen on anything but itself, you have now done an R. That's a reversal.
[11:44.570 --> 11:47.490]  You've used reversed pollen to put on any other plant.
[11:47.490 --> 11:49.410]  So if I put, this has been done.
[11:49.410 --> 11:53.890]  If we put reversed golden goat on a lemon skunk female, that does make Lemon Jeffrey
[11:53.890 --> 11:56.610]  R1 seeds.
[11:56.610 --> 12:00.930]  Lemon Jeffrey reversal filial generation number one.
[12:00.930 --> 12:02.930]  So let's talk about those two different things.
[12:02.930 --> 12:08.730]  Now we've got the selfing and the reversal, the R and the S. Let's talk about what I see
[12:08.730 --> 12:12.210]  in those and talk about stability amongst those plants.
[12:12.210 --> 12:16.170]  When I do the S1s, I see a lot of stability.
[12:16.170 --> 12:21.930]  Being a breeder that works with F1s of regular seeds and works with F2s and F3s, I understand
[12:21.930 --> 12:24.010]  the variations that I'm seeing.
[12:24.010 --> 12:30.730]  In my experience, in my opinion, when I make the S1, I'm going to say about 70 to 75% of
[12:30.730 --> 12:33.730]  those phenotypes look just like the mommy.
[12:33.730 --> 12:37.370]  Some of them look a little bit different, but sometimes also those are my favorites,
[12:37.370 --> 12:41.490]  those weirdos that don't look like the mom, that brought out some great grandparent that
[12:41.490 --> 12:43.130]  I don't even know what it is.
[12:43.130 --> 12:44.730]  Sometimes those are amazing.
[12:44.730 --> 12:50.010]  So most of the time when I'm working with the S1s, I want to say 75-ish percent of those
[12:50.130 --> 12:53.210]  are going to look just like the mommy.
[12:53.210 --> 12:55.170]  Which because you've got, that's all that you put in the mix.
[12:55.170 --> 12:58.570]  You took golden goat, you took golden goat, you poured golden goat in a pan, it's going
[12:58.570 --> 13:00.370]  to come out looking like golden goat.
[13:00.370 --> 13:04.650]  The options are that you're going to see parents of the golden goat and great grandparents
[13:04.650 --> 13:07.010]  and grandparents of the golden goat in that mix.
[13:07.010 --> 13:09.190]  You may see old stuff pop up.
[13:09.190 --> 13:12.450]  Most of the time, you're going to see the golden goat in that mix.
[13:12.450 --> 13:15.130]  Now let's talk about the R's, the reversals.
[13:15.130 --> 13:20.370]  Let's say we took a golden goat female and we put that pollen on a, when we put it on
[13:20.370 --> 13:22.450]  the lemon skunk, it makes lemon Jeffrey.
[13:22.450 --> 13:25.330]  That lemon skunk really dominates that mix.
[13:25.330 --> 13:29.930]  Most of those phenotypes look a lot like the lemon Jeffrey, or the lemon skunk.
[13:29.930 --> 13:34.010]  I would say 50% of them come out more lemon skunk than golden goat.
[13:34.010 --> 13:39.970]  Okay, now let's talk about putting that same reversed golden goat pollen on a female lemon
[13:39.970 --> 13:40.970]  skunk plant.
[13:40.970 --> 13:43.210]  And that makes lemon Jeffrey R1.
[13:43.210 --> 13:44.410]  We've talked about that a moment ago.
[13:44.410 --> 13:48.850]  The first filial generation of a reversal, and I've called it lemon Jeffrey.
[13:48.850 --> 13:52.250]  It's the lemon skunk female pollinated by the reversed golden goat.
[13:52.250 --> 13:53.750]  That's the R1.
[13:53.750 --> 13:58.950]  Most of those phenotypes come out looking very much like the lemon skunk plant.
[13:58.950 --> 14:01.670]  That's just something that comes from that plant from that cross.
[14:01.670 --> 14:05.350]  So I know that the common phenotype there is going to look a lot like the lemon skunk,
[14:05.350 --> 14:09.290]  but then it's got the golden goat potency and the speed and the vigor of the golden
[14:09.290 --> 14:10.650]  goat when it grows.
[14:10.650 --> 14:15.810]  The lemon skunk has a very unique leaf shape, a very unique growth pattern and structure.
[14:15.810 --> 14:17.530]  It's got a very great aroma.
[14:17.530 --> 14:21.330]  You can see that when you breed to it, I definitely see it come through.
[14:21.330 --> 14:25.650]  Most of the phenotypes look a lot like that lemon skunk, but there are a lot of phenotypes
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.770]  that look a little bit more golden goat.
[14:27.770 --> 14:31.770]  And there are things that kind of lean toward really lemon skunk and a little bit more and
[14:31.770 --> 14:33.130]  a little bit less golden goat.
[14:33.130 --> 14:34.890]  But a lot of it gets that lemon skunk.
[14:34.890 --> 14:36.890]  I can identify those phenotypes.
[14:36.890 --> 14:43.330]  I want to say that amongst that cross, probably 60 to 70% of those look a lot like the lemon
[14:43.330 --> 14:44.330]  skunk.
[14:44.330 --> 14:46.150]  Now let's talk more about the golden goat.
[14:46.150 --> 14:50.570]  What if I put that pollen on the platinum tangy, which has been done, that makes the
[14:50.570 --> 14:52.090]  orange chasm.
[14:52.090 --> 14:56.970]  When I do that one, I see basically 50-50 amongst most of the phenotypes.
[14:56.970 --> 15:00.590]  I'm going to say 70% of those phenotypes are 50-50.
[15:00.590 --> 15:06.110]  It's got the platinum tangy orange flavor and the golden goat growth shape and structure
[15:06.270 --> 15:08.670]  and that buzz and it smells like the oranges.
[15:08.670 --> 15:10.830]  It's basically 50-50.
[15:10.830 --> 15:12.270]  That's 70% of them.
[15:12.270 --> 15:16.510]  There are 30%, however, that will get really tall and really crazy.
[15:16.510 --> 15:18.510]  The platinum tangy doesn't do that.
[15:18.510 --> 15:20.230]  Golden goat doesn't do that.
[15:20.230 --> 15:24.590]  But the island sweet skunk and the Hawaiian sativa in there, they definitely do that.
[15:24.590 --> 15:26.630]  That is a parent of the golden goat.
[15:26.630 --> 15:29.950]  So we're seeing grandparents come through in some phenotypes.
[15:29.950 --> 15:34.590]  Now I said that 70% of them are 50% and 30% are going to be the outliers.
[15:34.590 --> 15:36.350]  You're going to see that really tall one.
[15:36.350 --> 15:37.870]  You're going to find one that's a little bit shorter.
[15:37.870 --> 15:38.870]  That one's really platinum tangy.
[15:38.870 --> 15:41.450]  Then you're going to find one that gets a real tall spear.
[15:41.450 --> 15:43.070]  That's really golden goaty.
[15:43.070 --> 15:48.110]  But the stability that I see in there is that most of those look like the 50-50 mix.
[15:48.110 --> 15:50.310]  It's going to be very cross-dependent.
[15:50.310 --> 15:51.630]  Which plant dominated the mix?
[15:51.630 --> 15:52.630]  Did the male win?
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.630]  Did the female win?
[15:53.630 --> 15:55.370]  Did they mix 50-50?
[15:55.370 --> 16:00.430]  As a breeder, my hopes and goals most of the time are to get that perfect 50-50 mix.
[16:00.430 --> 16:03.510]  I can't guarantee that because that's just how genetics work.
[16:03.510 --> 16:05.590]  The lemon skunk, when I cross to that, it wins.
[16:05.590 --> 16:07.110]  It wins most crosses.
[16:07.110 --> 16:08.470]  It kind of dominates the mix.
[16:08.470 --> 16:11.850]  But whatever I put it to really complements that mix.
[16:11.850 --> 16:16.830]  So to wrap it around and talk about stability, what I'm seeing is when I breed with the S1s
[16:16.830 --> 16:19.550]  is that I'm getting 70% common phenotypes.
[16:19.550 --> 16:25.390]  When I breed with the R1s, I'm probably getting 70%, 50-75% common phenotypes.
[16:25.390 --> 16:27.830]  It just depends on the plants that I'm breeding with.
[16:27.830 --> 16:29.430]  It depends on the mixture there.
[16:29.430 --> 16:32.310]  Like I said before, some plants are going to be more dominant in a mix and some are
[16:32.310 --> 16:35.150]  going to be less dominant and their traits are going to carry through.
[16:35.150 --> 16:37.430]  You may get a couple of traits that you really liked.
[16:37.430 --> 16:38.430]  You might not get what you wanted.
[16:38.430 --> 16:40.630]  It may be scattered amongst phenotypes.
[16:40.630 --> 16:42.470]  But I do see the stability.
[16:42.470 --> 16:51.590]  I don't feel the need most of the time to take a feminized cross past the S1 or R1 generation.
[16:51.590 --> 16:56.770]  I've done it and it locks things in, but then I can't breed to that because it makes things
[16:56.770 --> 16:57.930]  go weird.
[16:57.930 --> 16:59.830]  So I've made S2s of the Grateful Dog.
[16:59.830 --> 17:02.470]  I've done a back cross project of the Grateful Dog.
[17:02.470 --> 17:04.590]  I've made a Grateful Dog that will not reverse.
[17:04.590 --> 17:10.350]  I've feminized it so much that when I do treat it with a strong silver thio sulfate solution,
[17:10.350 --> 17:11.350]  it will not reverse.
[17:11.350 --> 17:12.750]  I can't get that one to flip.
[17:12.750 --> 17:16.310]  So if you play with them too much, you do start creating weird things.
[17:16.310 --> 17:17.550]  But it all depends on the plants.
[17:17.550 --> 17:20.730]  You can create wonky shit by using too many feminized crosses.
[17:20.730 --> 17:25.470]  You can create great shit by using too much feminized work in there.
[17:25.470 --> 17:29.470]  Sometimes you can create great things by going further generations with feminized seeds,
[17:30.110 --> 17:32.670]  but also sometimes some really weird shit does come out.
[17:32.670 --> 17:35.830]  It's all strain specific, plant specific.
[17:35.830 --> 17:37.910]  How common are the plants you were breeding together?
[17:37.910 --> 17:40.990]  How uncommon are those plants that you were breeding together?
[17:40.990 --> 17:42.590]  Just all about the magic code.
[17:42.590 --> 17:44.090]  Sometimes it will work.
[17:44.090 --> 17:45.090]  Sometimes it will not.
[17:45.090 --> 17:48.350]  I want to regroup and check my notes, see where else I need to go with this.
[17:48.350 --> 17:49.350]  All right.
[17:49.350 --> 17:52.150]  That was my quick talk on stabilizing feminized reversals.
[17:52.150 --> 17:53.510]  I hope I answered your question.
[17:53.510 --> 17:57.670]  This may be a quick podcast episode, but it is the 4th of July.

[18:00.230 --> 18:01.530]  Go spend some time with your family.
[18:01.530 --> 18:03.210]  Go spend some time with your friends.
[18:03.210 --> 18:06.010]  Go do that outdoor summer stuff that we like to do.
[18:06.010 --> 18:07.250]  Go smoke with a family member.
[18:07.250 --> 18:10.410]  If you're having a barbecue, go get one of your cousins way too high.
[18:10.410 --> 18:12.690]  Or if grandma's there, go get grandma high.
[18:12.690 --> 18:13.690]  See what that's like.
[18:13.690 --> 18:14.690]  That's always fun.
[18:14.690 --> 18:15.990]  I love it when old people fucking smoke.

[18:19.210 --> 18:21.810]  That rich white men didn't want to pay their taxes.
[18:21.810 --> 18:22.810]  All right, everybody.
