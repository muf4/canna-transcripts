[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.240 --> 00:06.500]  It is time for episode 426 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.500 --> 00:10.500]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.500 --> 00:13.260]  It is time to add fresh new genetics to your garden.
[00:13.260 --> 00:16.000]  You've been growing that same old shit for way too long.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.260]  Everybody's tired of that shit.
[00:17.260 --> 00:18.600]  You need to update your grow.
[00:18.600 --> 00:21.680]  You need some fresh new varieties in your grow tent.
[00:21.680 --> 00:26.440]  If you're ready for new feminized or regular seeds, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[00:26.440 --> 00:32.440]  and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.860]  If you listen to the podcast a lot, you know I like to start the show off by talking about
[00:35.860 --> 00:36.860]  what I'm smoking.
[00:36.860 --> 00:39.440]  Today, I've been dabbing on Larry O.G.
[00:39.440 --> 00:42.020]  Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:42.020 --> 00:43.900]  This is labeled as Indica Dominant.
[00:43.900 --> 00:51.280]  The potency label says this contains 68.8% THC and 82.3% total cannabinoids.
[00:51.280 --> 00:55.720]  I'm going to crack it open and give it a fresh smell so I can describe it properly for you.
[00:56.580 --> 01:00.800]  The first thing I should mention is the appearance and texture of this concentrate.
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.280]  There is a perfect amount of chunky diamonds and a beautiful amount of saucy terp sauce
[01:06.280 --> 01:07.820]  in this container.
[01:07.820 --> 01:11.080]  The color is the perfect golden color that I expect.
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.640]  The terps are not too runny.
[01:12.640 --> 01:14.960]  The crystals are not too big or too small.
[01:14.960 --> 01:18.960]  I really approve of the consistency of this product.
[01:18.960 --> 01:20.760]  This is a great batch of concentrate here.
[01:20.760 --> 01:21.760]  I'm going to give it a smell.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.760]  That's what I opened it up for.
[01:22.800 --> 01:23.800]  All right.
[01:23.800 --> 01:26.440]  At the first smell, you get some gas with the background of pine.
[01:26.440 --> 01:29.960]  Then, as it sits on your nose and you let it sit by your face for a little bit, it starts
[01:29.960 --> 01:32.520]  kicking in a little bit of a skunky aroma.
[01:32.520 --> 01:36.960]  I really do enjoy that type of a concentrate, that type of flavor and aroma, that classic
[01:36.960 --> 01:40.680]  OG Kush, kind of a skunky, earthy sort of a thing going on.
[01:40.680 --> 01:43.520]  There's a really great aroma and flavor coming from this product.
[01:43.520 --> 01:48.560]  Again, what I really like is the size of the chunky diamonds and the amount of diamonds
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.920]  compared to the amount of terp sauce.
[01:51.080 --> 01:56.200]  What happens in a lot of saucy, live resin, ambrosia, there are a lot of different names
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.680]  for these types of products.
[01:57.680 --> 02:01.360]  What happens to a lot of these products is sometimes you'll get a really big diamond
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.800]  and a little bit of terp sauce in there, or sometimes you'll get a whole bunch of terp
[02:04.800 --> 02:07.520]  sauce and very little diamonds in there.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.880]  Sometimes it's hard to work with something that is all terp sauce.
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.200]  You can't really get it on the dabber.
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.760]  You can't take a satisfying dab of it.
[02:13.760 --> 02:17.200]  Sometimes they give you a giant boulder of the diamonds in the middle and barely any
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.200]  terp sauce.
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.200]  You need some of the terps.
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.280]  I do like the diamonds the most because that's the potency, but I think the terps are important.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.120]  Without the terps, it's not the same.
[02:25.120 --> 02:27.800]  I really like it when there's a good ratio.
[02:27.800 --> 02:32.480]  These guys did a very good job at the ratio of terp sauce to diamonds, and the diamonds
[02:32.480 --> 02:34.480]  aren't too big or too small.
[02:34.480 --> 02:35.480]  Really great consistency.
[02:35.480 --> 02:39.560]  This has been one of my favorite concentrates that I've gotten most recently.
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.840]  Big shout out once again to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the Larry OG Indica Dominant
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.520]  Ambrosia.
[02:46.520 --> 02:49.800]  That's a lot of words for a product, but that is the strain name, and that of course the
[02:49.800 --> 02:52.480]  Ambrosia is their proprietary product.
[02:52.480 --> 02:53.480]  Go check it out, you guys.
[02:53.480 --> 02:55.320]  Make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[02:55.320 --> 02:56.320]  All right.
[02:56.320 --> 03:00.600]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of iTunes customer reviews and maybe a couple
[03:00.600 --> 03:01.600]  of emails.
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.800]  If we get there, before we get to that part, let's give a few shout outs to our friends
[03:05.800 --> 03:06.800]  from Patreon.
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.920]  I want to give a huge Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend Isaac.
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.280]  Of course, a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our buddy Tommy.
[03:14.280 --> 03:16.400]  As always, a big shout out to our buddy Keith K.
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.960]  A brand new shout out to our friend Sour D.
[03:18.960 --> 03:22.020]  Of course, another shout out to our friend Eric Ross.
[03:22.020 --> 03:24.280]  As always, a giant shout out to Paul T.
[03:24.280 --> 03:29.400]  And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast, Ivory Army shout out to my good friend
[03:29.400 --> 03:31.440]  Stabby McStabberson.
[03:31.440 --> 03:34.000]  I do appreciate all of the Patreon support.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.840]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[03:38.840 --> 03:40.600]  slash growfromyourheart.
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.200]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.320]  Once again, big thanks to everybody who has contributed to the Patreon campaign in the
[03:48.320 --> 03:51.040]  past, in the present, and in the future.
[03:51.040 --> 03:52.800]  All right, podcast world.
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.860]  At the start of the show, I said I was going to read some iTunes customer ratings and reviews.
[03:56.860 --> 03:59.480]  Let's get right into that part of the podcast.
[03:59.480 --> 04:03.000]  If you would like to leave a review on iTunes, it is really easy.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.320]  If you are listening on an Apple device, such as an iPhone or an iPad, it is really easy
[04:08.320 --> 04:10.280]  to leave a review.
[04:10.280 --> 04:13.200]  Go to the podcast app, just like you want to listen to the show.
[04:13.200 --> 04:15.480]  Click on the show, just like you're going to listen to it.
[04:15.480 --> 04:18.400]  Then you will see a list of available episodes.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.080]  Scroll right past the available episodes.
[04:20.080 --> 04:22.320]  It will say best of the podcast.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.660]  Then it will say ratings and reviews.
[04:24.660 --> 04:27.140]  That gives you the option to tap to rate.
[04:27.140 --> 04:29.120]  You get the option of one through five stars.
[04:29.120 --> 04:32.080]  Give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.020]  Then right underneath there is a tab that says write a review.
[04:35.020 --> 04:39.920]  That is where you are able to write a review and share your opinion of the podcast with
[04:39.920 --> 04:42.480]  the Apple iTunes community.
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.480]  If you are listening on an Apple device, I encourage you to please leave a review.
[04:47.480 --> 04:50.080]  Let's jump right into the reviews for this episode.
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.600]  The first iTunes customer rating and review for this episode was left on, where are we?
[04:54.600 --> 04:56.480]  April 18th, 2019.
[04:56.480 --> 05:00.320]  It was left by somebody who calls themselves BananaBoy53.
[05:00.320 --> 05:03.040]  The headline says easy to digest information.
[05:03.040 --> 05:05.360]  They gave us a five star rating.
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.760]  The customer review goes like this.
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.760]  Hey man, I love the show.
[05:09.760 --> 05:12.960]  I'm not officially a grower yet, but I hope to be soon.
[05:12.960 --> 05:17.240]  I love listening to you and your buddies sit around bullshitting as well as the information
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.760]  you all give out.
[05:18.760 --> 05:22.280]  Keep up the good work and shout out to White Mike.
[05:22.280 --> 05:23.760]  This guy is not yet a grower.
[05:23.760 --> 05:25.080]  He plans to grow in the future.
[05:25.080 --> 05:29.320]  He's listening to the show to get his prerequisites under his belt so that when it comes time
[05:29.320 --> 05:32.000]  to grow some plants, he actually has a solid foundation.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.800]  I really do enjoy that.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.800]  Thanks for listening.
[05:34.800 --> 05:38.400]  He says he likes listening to my buddies and I sit around and bullshit, which that's a
[05:38.400 --> 05:39.400]  lot of fun.
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.080]  I'm sure people are enjoying that and he enjoys the information.
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.320]  So I'm hitting my target.
[05:43.320 --> 05:44.960]  I love knowing that I'm hitting my target.
[05:44.960 --> 05:45.960]  I'm reaching my goal.
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.640]  So thank you for that great review.
[05:47.640 --> 05:51.080]  Then he goes on to say, keep up the great work and shout out to White Mike.
[05:51.080 --> 05:53.280]  Hey White Mike, you got another shout out dude.
[05:53.280 --> 05:55.400]  That means you need to come be on the show soon.
[05:55.400 --> 05:59.280]  Hey BananaBoy53, thank you for the great review.
[05:59.280 --> 06:02.960]  And of course, thank you for the five star rating.
[06:02.960 --> 06:04.560]  Let's get into the next review.
[06:04.560 --> 06:07.660]  This one says got to meet Ross DeJeff.
[06:07.660 --> 06:09.740]  They gave us a five star rating.
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.300]  It is from our friend Casey Binney.
[06:11.300 --> 06:16.860]  They left it on April 18th and the review goes a lot like this.
[06:16.860 --> 06:21.620]  I go by the name of Casey Binney and a recent astrological phenomenon seems to have lined
[06:21.620 --> 06:25.940]  everything up to make it possible for me to not only come to Denver for the first time
[06:25.940 --> 06:32.020]  in my life, but I was also able to attend the fabled Dude Grows Cup and meet Ross DeJeff
[06:32.020 --> 06:33.020]  there.
[06:33.020 --> 06:34.300]  Man, I'm so glad you made it.
[06:34.300 --> 06:37.020]  That's awesome that you think it was an astrological phenomenon.
[06:37.380 --> 06:39.780]  I think it's just fate and the way things were supposed to go.
[06:39.780 --> 06:40.820]  I'm glad you made it.
[06:40.820 --> 06:42.820]  I'm glad you made it to the Dude Grows Cup.
[06:42.820 --> 06:46.480]  If you don't know what the Dude Grows Cup was, there's another podcast that I encourage
[06:46.480 --> 06:47.480]  you to listen to.
[06:47.480 --> 06:49.940]  It is called the Dude Grows Show.
[06:49.940 --> 06:54.740]  It is hosted by a guy known as the Dude, also hosted by his buddy named Scotty Real.
[06:54.740 --> 06:57.460]  They've got a producer named Guru who does a wonderful job.
[06:57.460 --> 06:59.700]  He contributes heavily to the show.
[06:59.700 --> 07:03.800]  They have a great podcast with a very loyal following as do I.
[07:03.800 --> 07:07.200]  They threw an event in Denver that was called the Dude Grows Cup.
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.640]  It was a community-based grow-off kind of an event where a lot of people came together
[07:11.640 --> 07:13.120]  from all over the country.
[07:13.120 --> 07:14.480]  We got to show off our products.
[07:14.480 --> 07:16.320]  We got to enjoy each other's company.
[07:16.320 --> 07:20.900]  We got to educate each other and mainly just hang out and smoke down and enjoy the community
[07:20.900 --> 07:24.600]  that has been created around the Dude Grows Show.
[07:24.600 --> 07:26.020]  That's what the Dude Grows Cup was.
[07:26.020 --> 07:29.520]  Our friend was able to come out and hang out and he got to meet me there.
[07:29.520 --> 07:30.520]  There's more to this review.
[07:30.520 --> 07:33.680]  It says, Ross DeJeff was the coolest vendor at the cup.
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.680]  That means a lot to me, man.
[07:34.680 --> 07:35.680]  Thank you.
[07:35.680 --> 07:38.520]  We did have kind of a party going on at my booth the entire time.
[07:38.520 --> 07:41.440]  It got a little bit crowded over there, so that was a lot of fun.
[07:41.440 --> 07:45.920]  It goes on to say, it seemed that the other seed vendors were not priced with love.
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.280]  My man Jeff hooked me up with five packs of seeds for the price of one pack from some
[07:50.280 --> 07:55.800]  of the other guys and one pack was a 10-pack because he was out of five packs.
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.000]  I actually remember this.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.560]  I gave you a 10-pack of Hellfire OG because I'd ran out of five packs.
[08:01.560 --> 08:07.160]  Yes, many of the seed companies there are higher priced than myself.
[08:07.160 --> 08:08.560]  That's not an attack at anybody.
[08:08.560 --> 08:09.600]  That's just how it is.
[08:09.600 --> 08:13.720]  My seed packs are more friendly priced than many of the other seed companies out there.
[08:13.720 --> 08:16.360]  You'll also notice that I've got a smaller crew than everybody.
[08:16.360 --> 08:17.600]  They've got more people to pay for.
[08:17.600 --> 08:18.680]  They've got more stuff to cover.
[08:18.680 --> 08:20.240]  I keep my overhead small.
[08:20.240 --> 08:22.320]  That allows me to keep my pricing down.
[08:22.320 --> 08:25.960]  Also, I want everybody to have access to quality seeds.
[08:25.960 --> 08:29.520]  That's part of why I started breeding, part of why I started putting seeds out there.
[08:29.520 --> 08:30.800]  I want them to be affordable.
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.520]  There's no reason why everybody shouldn't be able to afford quality seeds.
[08:35.520 --> 08:38.640]  That's what I offer is a quality seed at an affordable price.
[08:38.640 --> 08:41.720]  It's just as good as the other expensive seeds.
[08:41.720 --> 08:42.880]  Just everybody can afford it.
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.360]  You don't have to feel like you're breaking the bank.
[08:44.360 --> 08:47.840]  You don't have to feel like you're going to go broke digging too deep into your pockets
[08:47.840 --> 08:48.960]  to get started.
[08:48.960 --> 08:52.160]  I do appreciate it that you notice that my stuff is a little bit more affordable.
[08:52.160 --> 08:54.080]  Yes, you asked for a five-pack of something.
[08:54.080 --> 08:55.080]  I didn't have a fiver.
[08:55.080 --> 08:57.080]  I wanted to make sure you got the seeds you needed.
[08:57.080 --> 08:59.480]  I gave you a 10 for the price of a five.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.480]  That's what we could do.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.160]  Got to take care of the people.
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.240]  It goes on to say, they all had more than five in the packs.
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.840]  Yes, that's also something I do.
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.960]  I tend to put six or seven seeds in the five packs.
[09:09.960 --> 09:13.520]  The 10 packs will have 12 to 14 seeds in them quite often.
[09:13.520 --> 09:15.920]  That's just how I do it when I can.
[09:15.920 --> 09:20.280]  He goes on to say, it was so cool to meet Jeff and the cup was the best party I've been
[09:20.280 --> 09:21.680]  to since my wedding.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.320]  Hey, my friend, I remember you.
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.560]  I remember this interaction.
[09:24.560 --> 09:25.840]  It was great meeting you.
[09:25.840 --> 09:32.240]  I look forward to seeing you at the next Dude Grows Cup event, which will be on 7-13 at
[09:32.240 --> 09:35.720]  Cultivated Synergy, the same exact place where we had the last event.
[09:35.720 --> 09:38.920]  I don't have a lot of details and a lot of information right now.
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.560]  Everything is still being put together and still being worked out, but there is another
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.920]  Dude Grows 7-10 event on 7-13 at Cultivated Synergy.
[09:47.920 --> 09:50.400]  I will keep you updated as often as I can.
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.400]  If you want up-to-date information, I suggest listening to the Dude Grows podcast.
[09:55.400 --> 09:56.400]  It's a great show.
[09:56.400 --> 09:58.200]  I feel no sense of competition.
[09:58.200 --> 09:59.200]  Those are friends of mine.
[09:59.200 --> 10:00.360]  It is all a community.
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.440]  I want everybody to grow the highest quality cannabis that they can grow.
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.840]  If you can get more information by listening to the Dude and Scotty and Guru, why not do
[10:07.840 --> 10:08.840]  it?
[10:08.840 --> 10:14.320]  Listen to my friends, the Dude Grows podcast, and join us at the Dude Grows 7-10 event.
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.800]  KC Benny, thanks again for the great review.
[10:16.800 --> 10:19.280]  Of course, thank you for the five stars.
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.920]  Again, bro, I look forward to seeing you in July.
[10:22.920 --> 10:23.920]  Let's move forward.
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.960]  I've got another review.
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.040]  The headline for this one says, Rasta Jeff and the Irie Army Kicks Butt.
[10:29.040 --> 10:30.760]  They gave us five stars.
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.320]  This one is from a person who calls themselves Daddyo45.
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.200]  They left this review on April 29th, and the review goes a lot like this.
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.200]  That was one kick butt show on auto-flowering and moving plants back and forth from indoors
[10:45.200 --> 10:46.200]  and outdoors.
[10:46.200 --> 10:48.040]  A lot of good information.
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.520]  He's talking about a recent episode I did where I talked about moving plants from an
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.960]  indoor grow room, putting them outdoors to get some sunshine, and bringing them back
[10:55.960 --> 10:58.640]  in at the end of the day to keep them in a flowering cycle.
[10:58.640 --> 11:02.840]  I kind of recommended not to do that because of the simple fact of bringing bugs into the
[11:02.840 --> 11:03.840]  grow room.
[11:03.840 --> 11:05.400]  So that's what they're referring to there.
[11:05.400 --> 11:07.120]  I'm glad you liked that episode.
[11:07.120 --> 11:12.000]  I love knowing that my advice is landing on somebody who is using it.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.600]  Sometimes you give out advice and you're like, I don't even know if anybody needs this information
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.440]  or if anybody cares, but when I know it's working for you, that means a lot to me.
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.920]  It lets me know that the effort I made actually did something for somebody.
[11:22.920 --> 11:23.920]  So thank you.
[11:23.920 --> 11:24.920]  That means a lot.
[11:24.920 --> 11:27.000]  He goes on to say, plus, thanks for reading my email.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.160]  It was kind of scary, but so freeing.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.160]  Thank you so much.
[11:30.160 --> 11:33.720]  I haven't felt this good since I got my first good night of sleep.
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.080]  I'm glad I could put a smile on your face.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.800]  Don't be too scared when I read your email on there.
[11:38.800 --> 11:41.960]  Sometimes people get tripped out because they put their name or whatever in the email.
[11:41.960 --> 11:42.960]  Think of it this way.
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.600]  If I say anything about you or anything on the show, the only people listening are fellow
[11:47.600 --> 11:48.600]  members.
[11:48.600 --> 11:49.600]  And they're not going to know who you are.
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.200]  If I say, so my friend Bill has this grow room.
[11:52.200 --> 11:54.000]  There are so many bills on the planet.
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  They don't know it's you, bro.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.600]  The only way that people are going to know it's you is if you make a big deal out of
[11:57.600 --> 11:58.600]  it and snitch on yourself.
[11:58.600 --> 12:01.640]  So if I ever say your name on the show, if I ever say your nickname on the show because
[12:01.640 --> 12:03.880]  of an email or something, don't get too paranoid.
[12:03.880 --> 12:06.520]  You're the only one that knows and it's supposed to be for you anyway.
[12:06.520 --> 12:09.080]  You're the one that feels the pride inside because I said your name.
[12:09.080 --> 12:11.800]  Like Sour D. We don't know who Sour D is.
[12:11.800 --> 12:14.360]  We don't know who Keith K is, but Keith K, he knows who he is.
[12:14.360 --> 12:15.960]  I gave him a shout out at the start of the show.
[12:15.960 --> 12:17.680]  Keith K knows exactly who he is.
[12:17.680 --> 12:19.160]  There are thousands of Keith K's out there.
[12:19.160 --> 12:21.400]  A lot of people are looking over at their buddy Keith going, is that you, bro?
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.600]  And they're going, it wasn't me, bro.
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.040]  But the one that it was, he's excited inside and he feels it.
[12:25.040 --> 12:26.320]  So don't ever feel weird.
[12:26.320 --> 12:29.240]  Don't ever feel nervous if I give you a shout out or say your name on the show.
[12:29.240 --> 12:30.560]  Nobody knows but you, bro.
[12:30.560 --> 12:31.880]  I'm rambling as shit today.
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.320]  I'm going to blame that on our friend caffeine and also Larry OG Ambrosia.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.320]  Let's keep going.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.320]  There is more to this.
[12:39.320 --> 12:44.200]  He says, one day I would love to just shake your hand and say thank you.
[12:44.200 --> 12:50.400]  And then he signed the review here with a green heart emoji and a fist bump emoji.
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.840]  Hey, that fist bump right there.
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.640]  I'm fist bumping the computer screen right back at you.
[12:54.640 --> 12:55.640]  Much respect.
[12:55.640 --> 12:56.640]  Thank you for the great review.
[12:56.640 --> 12:59.840]  I look forward to one day meeting you and shaking your hand.
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.280]  Once again, join me at the Dude Grows Cup on 713.
[13:03.280 --> 13:04.800]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[13:04.800 --> 13:05.800]  All right.
[13:05.800 --> 13:07.280]  There is one more review on the screen.
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.640]  Let's get into this one.
[13:08.640 --> 13:10.800]  This one was left on May 1st.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.080]  The headline is so awesome.
[13:12.080 --> 13:14.600]  Of course, they gave us a five-star rating.
[13:14.600 --> 13:17.360]  This one is from a person who calls themselves, how do you say that?
[13:17.360 --> 13:19.560]  Morgan Lucci, Morgan Lucky.
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.440]  I don't know how to say that, but I do appreciate the great review because it goes like this.
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.080]  Yo, man, I just started listening to your show about two weeks ago.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.080]  Hey, welcome aboard.
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.840]  Then it goes to say, I started from the beginning and I'm already on episode 107.
[13:33.840 --> 13:36.400]  Man, you have got a lot to go.
[13:36.400 --> 13:39.960]  It's kind of embarrassing when people go listen to that old shit, but I'm glad you're listening.
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.020]  I'm glad you're getting a solid foundation.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.740]  You're going to see that my growth style and my approach to growing and my attitude about
[13:45.740 --> 13:48.220]  some methods and techniques will change.
[13:48.220 --> 13:49.460]  That is acceptable.
[13:49.460 --> 13:53.860]  Don't be afraid to change as things evolve, but you will see me evolve and grow.
[13:53.860 --> 13:54.860]  Join me on that journey.
[13:54.860 --> 13:55.860]  Thank you for listening, man.
[13:55.860 --> 14:00.020]  I'm sure you're probably up to 200 by now since this was a few days ago.
[14:00.020 --> 14:03.740]  It goes on to say, this show rocks and I appreciate you sharing your wisdom.
[14:03.740 --> 14:08.220]  I will most definitely take a dab and give my mom a hug for you.
[14:08.220 --> 14:09.300]  Cheers, mate.
[14:09.300 --> 14:10.780]  I'm glad you feel that the show rocks.
[14:10.780 --> 14:12.500]  I hope I'm helping you out.
[14:12.500 --> 14:14.700]  You are very welcome for sharing the wisdom.
[14:14.700 --> 14:18.840]  I feel like I would be cheating or doing the world some sort of disservice or being selfish
[14:18.840 --> 14:23.740]  if I didn't share all of the things that I have gathered and learned along the way.
[14:23.740 --> 14:25.940]  Thank you for noticing and you're very welcome.
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.460]  Then he says, I'll definitely take a dab and give my mom a hug.
[14:29.460 --> 14:30.540]  He's following all the rules.
[14:30.540 --> 14:32.060]  This guy's doing it perfectly.
[14:32.060 --> 14:33.060]  Thank you for the great review.
[14:33.060 --> 14:34.660]  He ends it out with, cheers, mate.
[14:34.660 --> 14:35.660]  Big cheers.
[14:35.660 --> 14:36.660]  Thank you for the support.
[14:37.540 --> 14:41.020]  I want to thank everybody for the great iTunes customer reviews.
[14:41.020 --> 14:43.620]  Once again, everybody left us a five-star rating, which is great.
[14:43.620 --> 14:45.100]  I do appreciate that.
[14:45.100 --> 14:49.380]  Again, if you would like to leave an iTunes customer review, it is really easy.
[14:49.380 --> 14:54.920]  Simply open up your Apple device, either your iPhone or your iPad, go to the podcast application.
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.180]  If you're not already subscribed, all you have to do is search for the Grow From Your
[14:58.180 --> 15:00.500]  Heart podcast, click subscribe.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.820]  It will show you the available episodes.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.900]  Scroll right past the available episodes.
[15:04.900 --> 15:09.340]  It will give you the option to leave the amount of stars which you feel I deserve.
[15:09.340 --> 15:11.740]  Click on the amount of stars you feel is fair.
[15:11.740 --> 15:15.140]  Then right underneath that is the tab to click write a review.
[15:15.140 --> 15:19.700]  That is where you can write a review and I will read your review on a future episode.
[15:19.700 --> 15:21.260]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[15:21.260 --> 15:24.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the iTunes customer reviews for today.
[15:24.980 --> 15:27.740]  Let's move in to a quick email.
[15:27.740 --> 15:31.820]  This email comes from our friend Ryan and Ryan ended his email with, thanks, Ryan.
[15:31.820 --> 15:33.940]  It's just a first name, bro, so go for it.
[15:33.980 --> 15:34.980]  I like that.
[15:34.980 --> 15:35.980]  I know that I can say your name.
[15:35.980 --> 15:37.660]  It's not going to freak anybody out.
[15:37.660 --> 15:39.580]  This email goes a lot like this.
[15:39.580 --> 15:41.180]  Hey, Jeff, I love your show.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.500]  Hey, thanks for listening, dude.
[15:42.500 --> 15:47.380]  The question is, can I vacuum seal my nugs after they get to the desired ripeness in
[15:47.380 --> 15:48.380]  the jar?
[15:48.380 --> 15:53.540]  Yes, you can absolutely vacuum seal your nugs once they have reached the desired ripeness
[15:53.540 --> 15:54.540]  in your jar.
[15:54.540 --> 15:57.580]  Just make sure they are actually the ripeness you want them to be.
[15:57.580 --> 16:00.940]  If you do seal them up and there's too much moisture in there, you do run the risk of
[16:00.940 --> 16:04.100]  creating a mold problem inside of that container.
[16:04.100 --> 16:06.100]  It sounds like you are a smart man.
[16:06.100 --> 16:09.340]  It sounds like you know how far to take them before you seal them.
[16:09.340 --> 16:13.500]  As long as you get them to the correct ripeness, as long as you get them to the correct moisture
[16:13.500 --> 16:18.580]  level before you seal them up, yes, you can absolutely vacuum seal your product so that
[16:18.580 --> 16:21.140]  your nugs stay nice and fresh.
[16:21.140 --> 16:25.340]  If you're anything like me, you'll probably write the strain name and then you'll probably
[16:25.340 --> 16:29.420]  weigh that product before you vacuum seal it so you'll be able to write the strain name,
[16:29.420 --> 16:32.220]  the amount of product, and the date that it was sealed up.
[16:32.220 --> 16:35.900]  That way you have a lot of information and a lot of details on that product.
[16:35.900 --> 16:40.060]  Because you probably, if you're vacuum sealing shit, you've probably got quite a stash.
[16:40.060 --> 16:42.300]  You may have several things stashed away.
[16:42.300 --> 16:47.020]  Yes, you can absolutely vacuum seal your nugs, but make sure to label them so you don't forget
[16:47.020 --> 16:52.140]  what it is because we are, again, cannabis consumers and we like to forget a lot of small
[16:52.140 --> 16:53.140]  details.
[16:53.140 --> 16:54.500]  All right, podcast rule.
[16:54.500 --> 16:57.980]  That is all I've got for you for this quick Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[16:57.980 --> 16:58.980]  podcast.

[18:36.580 --> 18:41.540]  been supporting me and sending me encouraging emails, who has been leaving comments on YouTube.

[18:45.220 --> 18:46.220]  unnoticed.
[18:46.220 --> 18:47.460]  I do appreciate all of it.
[18:47.460 --> 18:49.980]  It keeps me recharged, and it keeps me encouraged.
[18:49.980 --> 18:50.980]  So big thank you.
[18:50.980 --> 18:52.580]  I really appreciate all of that.
[18:52.580 --> 18:55.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this quick episode.
[18:55.460 --> 18:59.860]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends, Love for the Plant and Love for the Bong.
[18:59.860 --> 19:03.260]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
