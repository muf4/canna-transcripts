[00:00.000 --> 00:02.100]  Hey, welcome back, podcast world.
[00:02.100 --> 00:06.400]  It is time for episode 438 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.400 --> 00:09.080]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.080 --> 00:13.680]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:13.680 --> 00:16.680]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:16.680 --> 00:23.760]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.760 --> 00:28.600]  For the past couple of days, I have been taking dabs of Tropicana lychee fambrosia from our
[00:28.600 --> 00:30.560]  friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:30.560 --> 00:38.160]  The potency label on this product says it contains 71% THC and 82.9% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.160 --> 00:40.360]  This four-gram jar smells ridiculous.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.840]  It smells like rotten mangoes.
[00:41.840 --> 00:43.420]  It smells like raspberry syrup.
[00:43.420 --> 00:47.040]  It smells deliciously disgusting and overwhelming all at once.
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.560]  When you take a dab, the raspberry flavor just coats your face.
[00:50.560 --> 00:54.660]  Then there's a sweet, sugary aftertaste that sticks around for quite a while, and the buzz
[00:54.660 --> 00:56.280]  goes straight to your brain.
[00:56.280 --> 00:57.440]  It makes you a little bit silly.
[00:57.440 --> 00:59.320]  It makes you forget where you put your car keys.
[00:59.320 --> 01:02.880]  It'll make you lose your phone while you're scrolling on Instagram.
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.480]  Once again, I want to give a huge shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.240]  delicious Tropicana lychee fambrosia.
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.200]  In this episode, I am going to read an email about overwatering and cocoa.
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.840]  Before we do that, let's give a few shout outs to my friends on Patreon.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.960]  How about a big shout out to my friend Jacob W.?
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.600]  How about a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Tyler R.?
[01:23.600 --> 01:27.440]  I want to send a giant shout out to John Milk, and of course, a giant Grow From Your
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.360]  Heart podcast shout out to my friend Sour D.
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.560]  Once again, big giant thanks to all of my friends who support the podcast on Patreon.
[01:35.560 --> 01:42.240]  If you would like to support the show, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com slash
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.400]  growfromyourheart.
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.880]  All the information that you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.720]  All right listeners, I said I was going to read an email about watering our plants in
[01:50.720 --> 01:52.080]  cocoa.
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.480]  Let's get right down to business.
[01:53.560 --> 01:56.280]  The email goes just like this.
[01:56.280 --> 02:01.960]  Hey Rasta Jeff, go ahead and use my name on your podcast because cannabis is so fucking
[02:01.960 --> 02:03.920]  legal here in Canada.
[02:03.920 --> 02:04.920]  I love that.
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.240]  That is a great way to start an email.
[02:06.240 --> 02:07.840]  I love the enthusiasm.
[02:07.840 --> 02:10.280]  Big shout out to my new friend Brett up in Canada.
[02:10.280 --> 02:11.280]  The message goes on.
[02:11.280 --> 02:16.300]  It says, aside from dabbing a little as a teen, I am new to cannabis use just prior
[02:16.300 --> 02:19.120]  to full Canadian legalization.
[02:19.120 --> 02:22.920]  Following a brain injury with a host of side effects I will not get into, I started using
[02:23.360 --> 02:24.360]  cannabis medicinally.
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.280]  Hey, I used cannabis long before I had a traumatic brain injury.
[02:28.280 --> 02:33.480]  Then I had a life disrupting traumatic brain injury and I have continued to use cannabis
[02:33.480 --> 02:37.680]  and I see the effects from when I am able to medicate properly.
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.360]  From when I am not able to medicate properly, I can tell that cannabis does help with the
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.280]  effects and or side effects of my traumatic brain injury and the recovery.
[02:46.280 --> 02:49.720]  So I do understand that it works for you and I am a believer and I hope things are going
[02:49.720 --> 02:50.720]  well.
[02:50.720 --> 02:52.480]  Let's keep going with this message because it's not about me.
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.040]  It says, without question, cannabis has been the single best medicine I have used for my
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.200]  issues with no side effects from its use.
[03:00.200 --> 03:04.980]  I have become a firm believer and advocate of this plant and its value as medicine and
[03:04.980 --> 03:07.080]  as a recreational herb.
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.080]  Let's be honest, when you don't feel good most of the time, it feels amazing to get
[03:11.080 --> 03:14.760]  some relief even if for a few hours.
[03:14.760 --> 03:19.520]  I completely understand and agree with everything that you just said.
[03:19.520 --> 03:21.760]  When you don't feel good, it's hard to enjoy life.
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.160]  It's hard to be around people.
[03:23.160 --> 03:25.320]  It's hard to do the things that you would normally enjoy.
[03:25.320 --> 03:28.260]  So it makes normal life a struggle just not feeling good.
[03:28.260 --> 03:33.400]  So finding relief through cannabis can put you back into your normal daily routine, put
[03:33.400 --> 03:38.000]  you back on a rhythm and put you back in the position to enjoy your life.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.280]  Now something I really like that our new friend Brett said is that he believes in the medicinal
[03:42.280 --> 03:46.040]  and recreational powers of cannabis.
[03:46.040 --> 03:52.920]  I think that almost all cannabis in a way can be labeled as some sort of medical or
[03:52.920 --> 03:55.320]  therapeutic use of cannabis.
[03:55.320 --> 03:57.400]  It makes you feel better.
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.060]  I can't speak for everybody, but in most cases, cannabis makes you feel better.
[04:02.060 --> 04:06.080]  And there is a point that if you consume too much cannabis, it will make you feel worse
[04:06.080 --> 04:07.200]  or like shit.
[04:07.200 --> 04:10.040]  So it works as any other medicine would.
[04:10.040 --> 04:13.960]  But I think that any use of cannabis can be considered recreational.
[04:13.960 --> 04:17.280]  If we're just sitting here at the table and I decide, hey, you want to smoke a joint with
[04:17.280 --> 04:20.460]  me and we smoke a joint, we feel better.
[04:20.460 --> 04:24.180]  We might've felt just fine before we smoked, but we feel even better after.
[04:24.180 --> 04:25.420]  So that is medicinal.
[04:25.420 --> 04:26.680]  That is therapeutic.
[04:26.680 --> 04:28.300]  That makes you feel better.
[04:28.300 --> 04:30.780]  Why would you not want to do something that makes you feel better?
[04:30.780 --> 04:34.720]  Even if you felt just fine before, you improved upon feeling just fine.
[04:34.720 --> 04:36.340]  Now you feel fucking excellent.
[04:36.340 --> 04:37.940]  Why wouldn't you want to do that?
[04:37.940 --> 04:39.300]  So I think that is medicinal.
[04:39.300 --> 04:40.300]  That is therapeutic.
[04:40.300 --> 04:43.900]  Now think about if you start in pain, you normally start at zero, right?
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.720]  Feeling just fine as a zero, feeling pretty cool as a one, feeling great as like a five,
[04:48.720 --> 04:51.240]  feeling fucking stone to shit as like a 10, right?
[04:51.240 --> 04:52.960]  Now you got the other way to go.
[04:52.960 --> 04:55.600]  Maybe when you wake up, your back hurts, your neck hurts.
[04:55.600 --> 04:59.320]  Maybe you got some sort of debilitating condition where everything hurts and you're already
[04:59.320 --> 05:01.760]  starting off at negative seven.
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.360]  You've already got a happiness and a comfort and a level of enjoyment deficit.
[05:06.360 --> 05:10.140]  You can only enjoy life so much if you already started off at negative seven.
[05:10.140 --> 05:14.700]  So it's time to consume something, smoke a couple of dabs, eat an edible, maybe rub
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.200]  some cream on there, maybe take some tincture.
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.720]  However you get your CBD and or THC into your body.
[05:20.720 --> 05:24.480]  When you do that, maybe you can take that negative seven to a negative five.
[05:24.480 --> 05:27.140]  Maybe we can get that down to a negative two.
[05:27.140 --> 05:31.560]  Hopefully we can dial in your treatment along with your diet and your medical cannabis intake,
[05:31.560 --> 05:33.640]  maybe a few other things to hone in your health.
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.200]  And hopefully we can get you to a zero and then eventually start turning you the other
[05:37.200 --> 05:39.680]  way and get you on the positive side again.
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.860]  So any way that cannabis is improving the quality of your life or allowing you to enjoy
[05:43.860 --> 05:47.940]  life a little more, I find that to be medicinal or therapeutic.
[05:47.940 --> 05:49.260]  We can see physical pain.
[05:49.260 --> 05:54.180]  We can see a lot of diseases and ailments, but mental health, you can't see.
[05:54.180 --> 05:58.680]  Being in pain all day, not being able to live your normal life because you were slowed down
[05:58.680 --> 06:02.100]  by pain or a condition will wear on you mentally.
[06:02.100 --> 06:03.540]  That will wear you out.
[06:03.540 --> 06:07.860]  Being able to smoke down and first of all, relieve that physical pain will allow your
[06:07.860 --> 06:09.860]  brain to enjoy life a little bit.
[06:09.860 --> 06:11.560]  You don't have to think about how bad it hurts.
[06:11.560 --> 06:14.100]  You don't have to think about protecting that sore spot.
[06:14.100 --> 06:16.140]  You can kind of chill out and enjoy.
[06:16.140 --> 06:19.180]  So first of all, the pain will melt away a little bit.
[06:19.180 --> 06:20.980]  Second, you'll forget about it.
[06:20.980 --> 06:24.140]  Third, you'll be able to just relax and enjoy yourself.
[06:24.140 --> 06:28.300]  You've now escaped that trap that was pain or that ailment that was bothering you.
[06:28.300 --> 06:30.400]  It's a little bit freeing.
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.300]  And that's the part a lot of people may overlook or may not see.
[06:33.300 --> 06:36.880]  We can see when someone's walking funny or grabbing their hip or making a funny face
[06:36.880 --> 06:40.600]  because their back hurts, but we can't see what you're going through from being in pain
[06:40.600 --> 06:41.600]  all day.
[06:41.600 --> 06:44.920]  So I think a little smoke, a little relief goes a long way.
[06:44.920 --> 06:48.320]  We can call all of that consumption medical or therapeutic.
[06:48.320 --> 06:50.360]  All right, I am rambly today.
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.200]  I'm going to blame it on those dabs.
[06:52.200 --> 06:53.400]  There is more to this email.
[06:53.400 --> 06:54.400]  Let's get back into it.
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.440]  It goes a lot like this.
[06:56.440 --> 07:02.000]  I have decided to grow my own after spending more than I can afford from licensed producers.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.320]  I'm now working on my second grow after harvesting a decent yield and quality legal product and
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.540]  making my own oil infusions.
[07:09.540 --> 07:13.480]  I am using auto flowers and I admit this knowing how you feel about them.
[07:13.480 --> 07:17.480]  A lot of times I have talked trash about auto flowers, but I have found that they work for
[07:17.480 --> 07:20.360]  people and if they have their application, use them.
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.640]  That's why they're there.
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.680]  Use them to the best of your advantage if that is what you want to do.
[07:24.680 --> 07:29.240]  I am going to be more diplomatic toward my auto flower growing friends.
[07:29.240 --> 07:32.920]  If you're going to buy auto flower seeds, big shout out to my friend at Mephisto Genetics.
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.840]  Let's keep going with the message.
[07:34.840 --> 07:36.960]  He says, I thought this was a good idea at the time.
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.520]  Remember, I've got brain damage.
[07:38.520 --> 07:43.120]  Then he goes on to say, but after listening to your podcast, I am very interested in running
[07:43.120 --> 07:45.640]  regular photo period seeds.
[07:45.640 --> 07:50.120]  As much as I would like to run your genetics for this, I'm afraid ordering from the USA
[07:50.120 --> 07:54.600]  may cause more grief than I'd like in the long run, potentially getting me banned from
[07:54.600 --> 07:55.600]  your country.
[07:55.600 --> 07:59.360]  Is there a chance that your genetics will make it to a distributor in Canada that I
[07:59.360 --> 08:01.120]  could then order?
[08:01.120 --> 08:06.520]  You know, I do not have any plans for a Canadian distributor anytime in the near future, but
[08:06.520 --> 08:11.300]  I can suggest you check with seedsherenow.com and see if they are able to help you out in
[08:11.300 --> 08:13.360]  any way, shape or form.
[08:13.360 --> 08:16.280]  Now this is the part of the email where we get to the question.
[08:16.280 --> 08:19.080]  It says, also I am growing in cocoa.
[08:19.080 --> 08:23.480]  I've listened and understand your level of watering, but what I can't find information
[08:23.480 --> 08:26.640]  on is when to begin watering to runoff.
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.840]  I get concerned about nutrient buildup in the cocoa, but I also don't want to overwater
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.640]  a plant without a root mass that can handle that much water.
[08:34.640 --> 08:39.880]  I want to get the most out of my plant genetics, but I feel that I'm holding them back by waiting
[08:39.880 --> 08:43.680]  too long to be sure they can handle a runoff watering.
[08:43.680 --> 08:45.680]  Any tips would be appreciated.
[08:45.680 --> 08:49.560]  Okay, I do have some great tips for you before we get there.
[08:49.560 --> 08:53.000]  Let's talk about the comment where you said you have listened and understand my levels
[08:53.040 --> 08:54.040]  of watering.
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.640]  I think what this person is referring to is episode 337, which is titled one through five
[08:59.640 --> 09:00.640]  watering tech.
[09:00.640 --> 09:04.280]  So if you guys would like to catch up with that, I highly suggest you listen to episode
[09:04.280 --> 09:08.880]  337 and understand one through five watering tech.
[09:08.880 --> 09:11.960]  Now let's get into the suggestion portion.
[09:11.960 --> 09:18.840]  When I am watering plants in cocoa, I like to achieve about 10 to 20% runoff with each
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.840]  watering.
[09:19.880 --> 09:24.760]  So what that means is I need to water that plant until that cocoa is saturated and continue
[09:24.760 --> 09:31.000]  to water until I get 20% excess water coming out of the bottom of my container.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.400]  There are a couple of reasons to water your cocoa this way, but the main reason is to
[09:35.400 --> 09:40.440]  make sure that you don't have any salts or nutrients from previous waterings built up
[09:40.440 --> 09:41.920]  in your medium.
[09:41.920 --> 09:46.000]  In most cases, we are feeding the plants more salts than they can take up.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.560]  There's going to be a buildup in the root zone.
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.020]  If we just keep adding more salts in and nothing runs off out the bottom, we will get
[09:53.020 --> 09:57.600]  a heavy saturation of salt-based minerals in our medium.
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.240]  That heavy saturation of salt-based minerals will disrupt the pH of our root zone.
[10:02.240 --> 10:04.320]  It will disrupt the uptake of our plants.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.680]  We will see nutrient lockout.
[10:05.680 --> 10:07.280]  We will see nutrient problems.
[10:07.280 --> 10:09.200]  We will see plants that start changing colors.
[10:09.200 --> 10:11.180]  We will see plants that start slowing down.
[10:11.180 --> 10:15.780]  We will not reach our harvest goals and we will not reach our potency expectations.
[10:15.780 --> 10:20.420]  So that is one of the main reasons why we like to water our plants to runoff when using
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.220]  cocoa as a medium.
[10:22.220 --> 10:26.100]  Now something I should touch on before we go too far is, if you are going to saturate
[10:26.100 --> 10:31.420]  your cocoa that heavily, it is a good idea to amend it with some sort of aeration product.
[10:31.420 --> 10:35.860]  I like to put perlite and persolite both in my cocoa mix.
[10:35.860 --> 10:42.120]  In most commercial environments, I prefer to run a 3-gallon fabric pot.
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.640]  I fill those fabric pots with a perlite, persolite, and cocoa coir mix.
[10:48.640 --> 10:56.880]  In most situations, I use 20% perlite, 20% persolite, and 60% cocoa.
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.520]  In some situations, I will adjust that mix depending on the environment, depending on
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.240]  the growers in that facility, depending on the genetics in that facility.
[11:04.240 --> 11:11.500]  But in some situations, I will do 15% persolite, 15% perlite, and 70% cocoa.
[11:11.500 --> 11:13.820]  Some of those decisions are based on genetics.
[11:13.820 --> 11:18.820]  Again, some of those are based on the facility, and some are based on the growers, and also
[11:18.820 --> 11:20.660]  those are based on schedules.
[11:20.660 --> 11:26.080]  If I use a little bit less perlite and persolite, I do get a little longer wet and dry time,
[11:26.080 --> 11:29.000]  so the plants don't need to be watered as frequently.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.180]  But if you are using cocoa and you're going to water to full saturation to get runoff,
[11:33.180 --> 11:37.460]  I do recommend some sort of aeration product in there.
[11:37.460 --> 11:39.580]  Perlite and persolite are always my go-tos.
[11:39.580 --> 11:44.260]  I like the way they fluff up that cocoa, and they don't add anything to my mix.
[11:44.260 --> 11:47.620]  And if we're going to talk about cocoa, one more thing I should mention, I don't know
[11:47.620 --> 11:49.380]  what brand of cocoa you're purchasing.
[11:49.380 --> 11:50.940]  I don't know where it comes from.
[11:50.940 --> 11:54.420]  No matter what it is, I do recommend giving it a rinse.
[11:54.420 --> 11:57.620]  When you buy bags of cocoa, it can be very salty.
[11:57.620 --> 12:02.220]  I have seen people use bagged cocoa straight out of the bag, into the pot, put a plant
[12:02.220 --> 12:05.720]  in it, feed it, throw it in the grow room, and watch that plant turn to shit because
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.480]  they did not rinse the excess salt out of that bagged cocoa.
[12:09.480 --> 12:11.080]  I don't know where your cocoa is coming from.
[12:11.080 --> 12:12.080]  I don't know how it was shipped.
[12:12.080 --> 12:13.520]  I don't know how it was stored.
[12:13.520 --> 12:19.080]  But I do know that a lot of times there is a large buildup of salt in a lot of store-bought
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.080]  cocoa.
[12:20.080 --> 12:22.200]  So rinse that out if you've got the opportunity.
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.040]  If you've got an EC meter, fill up a large container with water, test the EC of that
[12:27.040 --> 12:29.840]  water, test the pH of that water if you have the ability.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.640]  Mark those two things down.
[12:31.640 --> 12:36.440]  Fill a small container with cocoa, then water that container until you get runoff.
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.000]  Gather some of that runoff water in a clean container and test it.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  What is the pH?
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.040]  What is the TDS?
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.120]  What is the EC of that runoff water?
[12:44.120 --> 12:48.440]  If it is really high, you need to clean that cocoa before you put your plants in it because
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.000]  it will fry your plants.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.840]  Now it doesn't sound like our friend Brett is having a salt issue.
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.440]  I just wanted to make sure to mention that.
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.000]  Let's get back on track.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.520]  Let's have faith in Brett that he rinsed out his medium so we know he's got some nice clean
[13:00.520 --> 13:01.520]  cocoa.
[13:01.520 --> 13:05.240]  Let's also trust that he put plenty of perlite or persolite in there so we know that he has
[13:05.240 --> 13:06.920]  got plenty of aeration.
[13:06.920 --> 13:12.320]  We also know that he listened to episode 337 so he understands one through five water tech.
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.520]  He seems to understand that he wants a little bit of runoff, but he is afraid to water his
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.880]  small plants because he is not sure that their small root system is ready to handle such
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.680]  a massive watering.
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.140]  That's a really good concern because watering cocoa can be confusing.
[13:27.140 --> 13:29.240]  It can be deceiving the first few times.
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.040]  Cocoa does hold a lot of water and the wet and dry time is vastly different than that
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.160]  of working with a soil or soilless mix.
[13:38.160 --> 13:40.760]  Overwatering your plants and cocoa will slow them down.
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.880]  Also under watering them will allow them to get too dry which prevents them from eating
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.360]  which will give us nutrient deficiencies.
[13:47.360 --> 13:53.200]  So we do need to dial in our wet and dry cycles and our watering times and also dial in our
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.600]  amount of runoff.
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.920]  So let's talk about watering our small plants to runoff.
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.520]  The first part that really gets my attention is if you are too concerned about giving that
[14:04.520 --> 14:10.920]  plant that much water in that container size that maybe you have probably possibly up potted
[14:10.920 --> 14:12.280]  too early.
[14:12.280 --> 14:14.840]  Now you may have a small plant, you may have a clone.
[14:14.840 --> 14:17.280]  I would put that clone into a small pot.
[14:17.280 --> 14:21.600]  I would go something in like a four by four cube, maybe a six inch net pot, something
[14:21.600 --> 14:25.760]  really small where we can contain all of that medium where we don't have to water a whole
[14:25.760 --> 14:26.760]  bunch.
[14:26.760 --> 14:28.040]  That way you're not wasting a lot of water.
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.400]  You're not wasting a lot of nutrients just watering medium that doesn't have any roots
[14:31.400 --> 14:32.400]  in it.
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.080]  So start off with a smaller pot then gradually increase pot size until you reach your finished
[14:37.080 --> 14:38.600]  container size.
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.200]  My clones generally go into a four inch square pot or a six inch round net pot.
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.720]  Then I let them grow until that pot is filled with roots.
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.640]  I like to get it almost root bound in that container.
[14:49.640 --> 14:52.520]  Then I will transplant it into a three gallon pot.
[14:52.520 --> 14:56.880]  When I go from that four inch square pot or that round six inch net pot, I usually have
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.400]  to use my fingers to break up some of those roots to encourage them to grow outward because
[15:01.400 --> 15:04.800]  I leave it in that first pot until it gets fairly tight.
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.680]  That first container is only temporary.
[15:06.680 --> 15:10.120]  I just have it in there to get it developed, just to get it started.
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.200]  And I don't want to water a whole bunch of medium and a whole bunch of space with no
[15:13.200 --> 15:15.720]  roots so that smaller container is advantageous.
[15:15.720 --> 15:21.200]  Plus I can fit more of them in my space so I can pack way more small veg plants under
[15:21.200 --> 15:25.800]  some T5s or veg lights in a small pot than I could if I had them already in their three
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.720]  gallon pots and they're only six inches tall and have a few nodes and they haven't branched
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.720]  out yet.
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.240]  There's no need to give them that much space.
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.520]  So I keep them in the small pot and I let them grow until they're almost root bound.
[15:36.520 --> 15:39.720]  They really need to be transplanted by the time I pot them.
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.260]  Sometimes I almost have to cut the pot off because the roots have grown so massively
[15:43.260 --> 15:45.080]  inside the container.
[15:45.080 --> 15:48.360]  So my first thought is that you may be transplanting too soon.
[15:48.360 --> 15:53.120]  I would go from that clone to a small container, let it grow until it's busting out, then go
[15:53.120 --> 15:54.400]  to a big container.
[15:54.400 --> 15:58.280]  And then if you want to up pot one more time, I would wait once again until it is busting
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.720]  out until that first container is almost full of roots where when you take the container
[16:02.720 --> 16:06.640]  off, you can see those roots just spiraling around the outside of the container.
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.880]  Wait until then to transplant and that will absolutely reduce the risk of drowning your
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.360]  plant when you do water to full saturation to achieve a little bit of runoff.
[16:16.360 --> 16:19.440]  So my first concern is you may be transplanting too soon.
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.080]  If you're not transplanting too soon, maybe you are transplanting into too large of a
[16:23.080 --> 16:24.080]  pot.
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.560]  Maybe you need to make more gradual of a pot size increase and that may reduce the risk
[16:28.560 --> 16:32.240]  of creating a giant pool for that small plant to drown in.
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.040]  So maybe wait a little bit longer and possibly reduce the transplant pot size.
[16:37.040 --> 16:39.080]  That may help you out right off the bat.
[16:39.080 --> 16:41.360]  So let's say Brett has done everything correctly.
[16:41.360 --> 16:43.800]  He has got his small container plant.
[16:43.800 --> 16:44.800]  It is busting out.
[16:44.800 --> 16:47.400]  The roots are starting to hang out of the bottom of the pot a little bit.
[16:47.400 --> 16:49.200]  You can see it creeping out through the drainage holes.
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.240]  We've got some roots coming out there.
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.840]  They look like nice spaghetti.
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.680]  So that plant is in a four inch square pot or perhaps a six inch net pot.
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.240]  Let's up pot that plant into a three gallon pot of cocoa.
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.760]  So let's say we just gently remove that six inch net pot right off the root ball there.
[17:03.760 --> 17:04.760]  It should pop out.
[17:04.760 --> 17:08.920]  If it's not super wet, if it's not super dry, it should just slide off nice and easily.
[17:08.920 --> 17:11.360]  All of the medium should stay in one nice clump there.
[17:11.360 --> 17:13.480]  You'll see roots wrapped around the bottom of it.
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.080]  At this point, I would hold the plant in my palms to where the plant is facing straight
[17:18.120 --> 17:19.760]  up just like it naturally should.
[17:19.760 --> 17:22.120]  I'm kind of cradling the plant in my palms.
[17:22.120 --> 17:27.880]  I would stick my fingers in the middle of the bottom of that root ball and I would just
[17:27.880 --> 17:30.520]  separate it and break it up a little bit with my fingers.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.520]  You're going to hear it.
[17:31.520 --> 17:33.640]  It sounds like you're pulling someone's dreadlocks apart.
[17:33.640 --> 17:34.880]  It sounds bad.
[17:34.880 --> 17:38.320]  You were encouraging proper root growth at this time.
[17:38.320 --> 17:42.440]  If that plant is tied up in that container, you want to break those roots up so that it
[17:42.440 --> 17:43.820]  will spread out.
[17:43.820 --> 17:45.520]  Those roots are now used to growing in a circle.
[17:45.520 --> 17:47.440]  We want to tell them, hey, you're free.
[17:47.440 --> 17:48.440]  Grow that way.
[17:48.440 --> 17:49.440]  Grow out.
[17:49.440 --> 17:50.440]  Grow down.
[17:50.440 --> 17:51.440]  Go fill this new container.
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.440]  I would separate them.
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.320]  Then I would set that in the new container that is probably about halfway, three quarters
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.160]  of the way filled with cocoa.
[17:58.160 --> 18:00.220]  Set that new plant right inside that pot.
[18:00.220 --> 18:01.700]  Fill that container up with cocoa.
[18:01.700 --> 18:02.880]  Pack it semi-tight in there.
[18:02.880 --> 18:03.880]  You don't want it super tight.
[18:03.880 --> 18:04.880]  You don't want it super loose.
[18:04.880 --> 18:07.520]  You don't want the water falling right through, but you don't want it so tight that the roots
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.960]  can't dig through it.
[18:08.960 --> 18:10.440]  Pack it semi-tight.
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.840]  When you're filling containers, I always suggest leaving an inch or two so that you can water
[18:13.840 --> 18:14.840]  the plant.
[18:14.840 --> 18:17.520]  Don't forget you need room for water in that container.
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.000]  You've got it filled up appropriately.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.160]  You've now got your plant essentially successfully transplanted.
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.200]  At this time, I would saturate that cocoa.
[18:25.200 --> 18:27.320]  I would water until runoff.
[18:27.320 --> 18:32.280]  At that first transplant time, I really love to soak the shit out of the cocoa.
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.680]  I may go more than 20% runoff at this time because I want to ensure that I saturate all
[18:37.680 --> 18:40.600]  of that medium with water, with nutrients.
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.000]  I want to settle everything in.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.600]  I don't want there to be any dry spots.
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.120]  If there's a dry spot in the middle, that will slow down plant production.
[18:47.120 --> 18:49.160]  I want to saturate my new medium.
[18:49.160 --> 18:52.280]  That'll really help the cocoa settle into the container and let me know if I need to
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.120]  add more onto the top.
[18:54.120 --> 18:57.360]  Now you're probably thinking, holy shit, Rasta Jeff, we just drowned the plants.
[18:57.360 --> 18:58.760]  There's so much water in this container.
[18:58.760 --> 18:59.760]  It is super heavy.
[18:59.760 --> 19:03.600]  Yes, it should be, but we've got an aeration product in there.
[19:03.600 --> 19:05.120]  We've got 20% perlite.
[19:05.120 --> 19:09.120]  We've got 20% persolite or a similar mix in our container.
[19:09.120 --> 19:11.840]  We don't have to worry about drowning the plants.
[19:11.880 --> 19:16.240]  We've also got a healthy plant with an established root zone that can take this type of a watering,
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.800]  so we shouldn't have to worry about drowning that plant.
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.000]  Now the next step is to watch this plant as the medium dries.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.840]  A lot of people are going to want to stick a moisture content meter inside that cocoa
[19:26.840 --> 19:28.720]  and they can pay attention to that digitally.
[19:28.720 --> 19:31.320]  They can look at it on their phone and they can see what's going on.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.180]  I think the best way to do it is to pay attention.
[19:34.180 --> 19:35.180]  Watch the plant.
[19:35.180 --> 19:36.500]  Stick your finger in the medium.
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.560]  Pick up the pot.
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.820]  When you pick up the pot, does it feel nearly as heavy as it did when you first watered?
[19:41.820 --> 19:44.380]  Does it feel half as heavy as it did when you first watered?
[19:44.380 --> 19:47.420]  Or does it feel super light like you might throw it across the room?
[19:47.420 --> 19:49.740]  That comes from one through five water tech.
[19:49.740 --> 19:50.740]  Feel that.
[19:50.740 --> 19:51.980]  You'll know if it needs water.
[19:51.980 --> 19:54.180]  When you put your finger in there, does it feel wet?
[19:54.180 --> 19:55.500]  Does it feel dusty?
[19:55.500 --> 19:56.500]  You'll learn.
[19:56.500 --> 19:57.660]  Does the plant need water?
[19:57.660 --> 20:01.500]  The most important thing to pay attention to is the plant.
[20:01.500 --> 20:02.500]  Watch the plant.
[20:02.500 --> 20:04.100]  Is it telling you that it needs a drink?
[20:04.100 --> 20:07.260]  When cannabis plants get thirsty, the leaves start to droop.
[20:07.260 --> 20:11.180]  When they get really thirsty, the top of the plant starts to tip over.
[20:11.180 --> 20:12.260]  Pay attention to that plant.
[20:12.260 --> 20:17.140]  The minute you see those leaves start to droop, it needed water just a few minutes ago.
[20:17.140 --> 20:20.660]  Write down how long ago it was, or remember what that medium feels like.
[20:20.660 --> 20:22.020]  Put your finger in there now.
[20:22.020 --> 20:23.140]  Pick it up now.
[20:23.140 --> 20:24.140]  Remember that.
[20:24.140 --> 20:25.660]  Don't let it get to that point.
[20:25.660 --> 20:30.580]  Next time, water it 15 minutes before it gets to that point, and you have found the ideal
[20:30.580 --> 20:34.080]  watering cycle for a plant in a cocoa container.
[20:34.080 --> 20:40.340]  Your wet and dry times are going to vary depending on plant size, container size, light size,
[20:40.500 --> 20:42.540]  and VPD of the room.
[20:42.540 --> 20:47.340]  But as long as your plant is large enough and established enough to be in the size pot
[20:47.340 --> 20:53.180]  in which you have put it, you should not overwater your plant if you give it enough time to dry
[20:53.180 --> 20:55.140]  between waterings.
[20:55.140 --> 20:59.500]  My main suggestions would be to make sure that your plant has a well-established root
[20:59.500 --> 21:01.540]  zone before you try to up-pot it.
[21:01.540 --> 21:05.660]  My next suggestion is make sure you're not going into too large of a container.
[21:05.660 --> 21:09.060]  Then when you do water, get that saturation, get that runoff.
[21:09.060 --> 21:14.140]  Then the next step is patience and learning the plant to see when it wants water again.
[21:14.140 --> 21:20.020]  That part is going to be room, environment, plant, and strain, and also watering type
[21:20.020 --> 21:21.300]  dependent.
[21:21.300 --> 21:24.940]  That is part of the relationship that you will have to build with each plant.
[21:24.940 --> 21:28.640]  Now sometimes you're going to be worried because the bottom part of your container will have
[21:28.640 --> 21:30.460]  more moisture than the top part.
[21:30.460 --> 21:34.580]  Hopefully your roots have grown down to that bottom part and they are drinking from that
[21:34.580 --> 21:35.820]  bottom part.
[21:35.820 --> 21:41.100]  That slight dryness will encourage the roots to go seeking moisture and finding water and
[21:41.100 --> 21:42.340]  nutrients.
[21:42.340 --> 21:48.300]  But there is a fine line between encouraging growth and completely starving and dehydrating
[21:48.300 --> 21:49.660]  a plant.
[21:49.660 --> 21:51.020]  Pay attention to the plants.
[21:51.020 --> 21:54.820]  Learn when they start showing you that they're a little bit thirsty, and then learn to water
[21:54.820 --> 21:56.500]  right before that time.
[21:56.500 --> 21:57.860]  You will develop a relationship.
[21:57.860 --> 21:59.900]  It will become very comfortable.
[21:59.900 --> 22:00.900]  You'll know.
[22:00.900 --> 22:03.240]  You'll be able to look and you'll go, oh, they're going to want water pretty soon.
[22:03.240 --> 22:05.660]  That will become natural to you.
[22:05.660 --> 22:10.020]  Once your roots are developed and that pot is full of roots, you'll notice that they
[22:10.020 --> 22:13.420]  will tolerate being too wet more than they will too dry.
[22:13.420 --> 22:15.300]  So that will be something that you'll start to notice.
[22:15.300 --> 22:19.580]  Again, a lot of this stuff just comes from developing a relationship with the plant.
[22:19.580 --> 22:24.240]  A lot of it comes from developing a relationship with one specific cultivar.
[22:24.240 --> 22:28.860]  So I would say dial it in, grow one plant over and over again, learn your cocoa, learn
[22:28.860 --> 22:33.260]  your plant, learn your watering system, then expand from there.
[22:33.260 --> 22:36.100]  Whatever you do, whatever I say, whatever you learn, wherever you read it, just keep
[22:36.100 --> 22:37.940]  in mind the plants are the boss.
[22:37.940 --> 22:41.500]  All of the monitors, all of the equipment, all that stuff, it won't make a difference
[22:41.500 --> 22:45.180]  if you've got a moisture content sensor in there and it says there's plenty of water
[22:45.180 --> 22:47.780]  and that plant says, bullshit, the plant is right.
[22:47.780 --> 22:49.660]  That monitor doesn't know what that plant likes.
[22:49.660 --> 22:54.140]  So dial it in, pay attention to the plants, pick up your plants, keep an eye on them,
[22:54.140 --> 22:56.580]  and you will learn exactly when to water your plants.
[22:56.580 --> 23:01.340]  And again, if you're worried about overwatering, you're probably in too large of a container
[23:01.340 --> 23:03.100]  and the roots weren't ready to go.
[23:03.100 --> 23:04.100]  So big.
[23:04.100 --> 23:06.300]  All right, Brett, I want to thank you for a great email.
