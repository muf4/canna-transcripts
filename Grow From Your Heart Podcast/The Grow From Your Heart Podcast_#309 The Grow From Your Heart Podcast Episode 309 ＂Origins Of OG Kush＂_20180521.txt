[00:00.320 --> 00:04.000]  Hey what's up podcast world, it's Rasta Jeff, it's time for another episode of
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.480]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. No music, I just wanted to get right to it.
[00:07.480 --> 00:11.720]  It's Thursday, I usually try to put out a Thursday quickie episode. This one may
[00:11.720 --> 00:16.700]  not be so fast, I've got a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it. You guys,
[00:16.700 --> 00:19.320]  I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I've been smoking
[00:19.320 --> 00:23.600]  on today. Today I've been taking dabs, I actually just finished off the jar of
[00:23.600 --> 00:28.240]  Star Child OG from our friends at A Cut Above in Colorado Springs. I picked this
[00:28.240 --> 00:34.240]  up at the Fillmore location. It smells kind of like dryer sheets. I really like
[00:34.240 --> 00:38.040]  the way it smells. It is delicious, it's kind of got a Jack Herrer sort of a
[00:38.040 --> 00:41.600]  smell if you're familiar with Jack. It's also got a train wreck kind of aroma. I
[00:41.600 --> 00:45.800]  really like it, super sativa head buzz, gets me talkative, makes my head spin.
[00:45.800 --> 00:52.160]  Great podcast dabs. Also I've got some Sour Pez Ambrosia from our friends at
[00:52.160 --> 00:55.800]  Apothecary. You guys know I like to get the Apothecary concentrates. When you
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.840]  open it up and give it a smell, it smells like a lemon-lime kind of a candy.
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.960]  It smells like a sour pez. Then when I smoked it, on the way in, the inhalation
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.000]  tasted like a lime rind. Like if you'd scrape the inside of a lime and lick
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.680]  that. And it was pleasant, but it was really tart and it was surprising. I was
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.640]  like, oh shit, that's a lot of flavor. And then on the way out, it was just straight
[01:18.640 --> 01:22.920]  up grapefruit citrus. I'm smelling the jar again, I'm picking up more of the
[01:22.920 --> 01:27.360]  grapefruit now that I'm smelling it again, closer to my face. But limes and
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.840]  grapefruit, you guys, this one was really unique. The Sour Pez Ambrosia from
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.520]  Apothecary. Both of these obviously super sativa because my head is going, my eyes
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.840]  are wide open, and I'm ready to ramble. I'm ready to get into my main topic. Let's
[01:39.840 --> 01:44.360]  jump right to it. I was on Instagram Live and somebody asked me, how do I feel
[01:44.360 --> 01:48.400]  about people breeding with my seeds? Of course I do have a seed company. I'm
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.040]  Irie Genetics. I make seeds. Those seeds are commercially available on the
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.360]  internet, which means that people are getting a hold of them, which means
[01:57.360 --> 02:00.920]  people are growing them, which means they're finding select males and select
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.320]  females, which may be great candidates for breeding. Now who would I be to say,
[02:06.320 --> 02:12.400]  do not breed with those great plants. I invite you to breed with the plants that
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.040]  come from my seeds. I welcome it. Please do that. There are people breeding grape
[02:18.160 --> 02:21.560]  projects with things that I've made. There are things that came from my
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.640]  Capleton. There's a whole seed line that came from my Capleton. There are guys
[02:25.640 --> 02:28.880]  breeding with my Black Cherry Chem. I'm sure that there are things I don't even
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.040]  know about being bred with my stuff. I can't be mad about it. I did not invent
[02:34.040 --> 02:38.680]  cannabis. I did not invent the seed stock that I started breeding with. I was
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.360]  gifted clones. I created a nice clone library for myself by gathering clones
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.480]  from friends, and when other dispensaries would have clones for sale, I would go
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.960]  get them, and I got clones through various other means that I won't mention
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.440]  here on the show. I had a nice clone library, and then I got bored with just
[02:54.440 --> 02:57.080]  growing from clones, and I wanted something different that not everybody
[02:57.080 --> 03:00.520]  else had, so I started getting seeds, and then I started buying seeds and getting
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.760]  addicted to buying seeds off of the internet. So my breeding stock came from
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.440]  seeds I bought off of the internet. I kept buying those seeds, and I'd find
[03:08.440 --> 03:11.400]  great stuff, but then I was like, why do I keep spending money on seeds and
[03:11.400 --> 03:14.360]  throwing away male plants? I could learn how to breed myself, so I started
[03:14.360 --> 03:17.560]  studying breeding. Then I built a separate little breeding area for
[03:17.560 --> 03:21.240]  myself, and I used one of the males that came from a seed pack that I bought, and
[03:21.240 --> 03:26.920]  I put the pollen on clones that I had gotten from friends, and plants
[03:26.920 --> 03:29.760]  that came from seeds that I'd bought on the internet. So I was breeding to clones
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.320]  and seeds by using a seed that I had purchased. So I can't be mad at anybody
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.960]  if they want to use my seeds for breeding. I should be honored if they
[03:37.960 --> 03:41.680]  find one of my plants that comes from one of my creations good enough, and
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.120]  worthy enough, and impressive enough to continue its genetic line. I should be
[03:46.120 --> 03:50.200]  proud of that. The only thing I ask for is credit. When you write down what the
[03:50.200 --> 03:55.160]  genetics are, put that you used whatever of my cross you used, Storm Shadow,
[03:55.160 --> 03:59.760]  fucking Scarlet Begonias, write it down. And if you're gonna write this down, make
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.520]  sure you write it down properly. When you write down genetic crosses, ladies first.
[04:03.520 --> 04:09.200]  So if you use a female Stardog plant and a male Arise, you will write Stardog X
[04:09.520 --> 04:12.800]  Arise, and that's your one plant. If you're gonna cross that plant to
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.680]  something else, you'll put Stardog X Arise in parentheses, so it'll be
[04:16.680 --> 04:21.680]  parentheses Stardog X Arise parentheses, then you'll put an X on either side of
[04:21.680 --> 04:25.640]  that, depending on if that's the boy or girl. If that one's gonna be the girl, it
[04:25.640 --> 04:30.120]  would be parentheses Stardog X Arise parentheses X, then your boy plant,
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.160]  whatever that's gonna be. So make sure that you go ladies first when you're
[04:33.160 --> 04:36.800]  writing down genetics. I hope I didn't over make that too complicated there. I
[04:36.800 --> 04:39.560]  hope I didn't over complicate that for you guys, but still, ladies first when
[04:39.560 --> 04:43.320]  you're writing down genetics. So it doesn't bother me at all when people
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.320]  breed with my genetics, because I am breeding with other people's genetics.
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.760]  Even when I'm breeding now, I have to get other stuff. I have to outsource other
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.040]  things, because if I just keep breeding with everything that I've already got,
[04:55.040 --> 04:58.920]  it's just gonna be a bunch of inbred stuff. I've got to pull other male plants
[04:58.920 --> 05:02.280]  out of somewhere, I've got to get other female plants out of somewhere, or I'm
[05:02.280 --> 05:05.240]  just gonna be doing a bunch of cousin fucking, and I'm gonna make a whole bunch
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.400]  of the same seeds before too long. So I have to have breeding stock that is not
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.700]  all mine, so which means I have to use other people's stuff. And the way that I
[05:13.700 --> 05:18.800]  honor them and show them respect is I clearly label what I used in my crosses.
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.680]  So you can see what I'm using, and that's how I don't piss off the other guys and
[05:22.680 --> 05:26.640]  it keeps it fair. And I ask you to do the same if you breed with my stuff. You've
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.080]  bought the seeds, they're yours. Like can a car salesman say, hey now when you
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.480]  drive off with this car, please don't take it to the east side. You tell them, fuck you,
[05:33.480 --> 05:36.760]  I'm going to the east side, it's my car. Or if he says, when you buy this
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.000]  motorcycle, please don't drive it down dirt roads. You're gonna say, bro, dirt
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.160]  roads with this motorcycle all day, don't worry, it's mine. Like that's how I feel
[05:43.160 --> 05:46.280]  about my seeds. If you buy my seeds and you want to breed with them, have a good
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.640]  time. Those are yours, you paid for them. Just give me some credit if you do breed
[05:49.640 --> 05:52.680]  with them. And when you post pictures, tag me in it. That would be cool also.
[05:52.680 --> 05:57.520]  Alright, so that's my rant on how I feel about people breeding with my seeds. I
[05:57.520 --> 06:02.360]  may have done that rant on another episode, but that leads me into another
[06:02.360 --> 06:08.200]  thing. We were talking on another forum and somebody said that OG Kush stands
[06:08.200 --> 06:14.560]  for ocean grown. Another person said that OG Kush stands for original gangster. I
[06:14.560 --> 06:18.800]  heard a lot of silly things. I would like to give my opinion and I would like to
[06:18.800 --> 06:25.160]  start a conversation and hear what you think. I'm gonna go the long route and
[06:25.160 --> 06:29.080]  not tell you right away what I think OG stands for, but that's how it's gonna
[06:29.080 --> 06:34.600]  be the punchline. So a long time ago there was a website and on this website
[06:34.600 --> 06:38.160]  this website is gone so you couldn't find it if you wanted to now it was shut
[06:38.160 --> 06:41.360]  down. A lot of the people were raided. A lot of people that were a part of this
[06:41.360 --> 06:44.680]  website were raided by the DEA and their local authorities for growing cannabis.
[06:44.680 --> 06:49.320]  This was huge. A lot of people were a part of this website that are now
[06:49.320 --> 06:53.200]  prominent members of the cannabis industry. A lot of people that were taken
[06:53.200 --> 06:56.120]  down would have been dominant members of the cannabis industry if they weren't
[06:56.120 --> 07:02.000]  raided because of this website many years ago. This website was home to a lot
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.560]  of cannabis growers, breeders, and enthusiasts and activists. A lot of these
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.120]  people were growing at home and breeding at home. A lot of these people had gotten
[07:10.120 --> 07:13.880]  seeds from around the world and brought them back to the United States and were
[07:13.880 --> 07:17.680]  growing them in small home grows that were fully illegal at the time. There was
[07:17.680 --> 07:22.480]  no medical marijuana at this time. Maybe California was thinking about it. A lot
[07:22.480 --> 07:26.280]  of these growers were growing and breeding at home because that was what
[07:26.280 --> 07:31.600]  they had access to was those seeds. So people were...here's part of where I think
[07:31.600 --> 07:37.480]  the OG Kush name came from. I think somebody acquired seeds from from Kush
[07:37.480 --> 07:40.200]  but where's Kush? I want to say Kush Mountain. I want to say Kush Valley but
[07:40.200 --> 07:44.200]  I'm sure that those are dispensaries. Anyway people got seeds from Kush
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.480]  probably from soldiers who traveled overseas and came back with cannabis
[07:48.480 --> 07:52.360]  and said these came from Kush. Either the Kush Mountains, the Kush Valley,
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.160]  wherever they were, the word Kush was involved in these seeds. They were
[07:56.160 --> 07:59.880]  delivered to somebody. Maybe they brought them back themselves and were on this
[07:59.880 --> 08:04.120]  website that I'm talking about. I think they grew these seeds. I think they bred
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.320]  with these seeds. I think then they took a handful of these seeds and what I
[08:08.320 --> 08:12.640]  think what was happening on this website is a guy like myself that could breed
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.880]  would breed seeds and send them out to five or ten maybe 15 or 20 of his
[08:16.880 --> 08:20.600]  friends. I honestly don't know exactly. This is a theory. Those guys would work
[08:20.600 --> 08:26.280]  the seeds and then send them back or pass them around. I think that somebody
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.800]  was really narrowing something down and breeding it with a couple of people in a
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.440]  group in different locations through the mail. Seeds were being passed. They'd go
[08:36.440 --> 08:39.960]  to one guy. He would breed do it and do his thing and then he would send seeds
[08:39.960 --> 08:44.280]  back to the original guy plus more people who would then breed to it and I
[08:44.280 --> 08:49.200]  think that out of all of this breeding is where the OG Kush came from is from
[08:49.200 --> 08:53.280]  some of this breeding project that came off of this website and if you guys
[08:53.280 --> 08:56.960]  haven't caught on by now if you're OG you know what I'm talking about the
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.240]  website I'm talking about is overgrow.com. I personally don't think that OG
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.520]  stands for ocean grown because a lot of it was not grown near the ocean and I
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.360]  also don't think that OG was original gangster because a lot of the circles
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.920]  that had the OG Kush originally were not the gangster types. They were more
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.280]  hippies and they were more more on the hippie side of life than the gangster
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.080]  side of life. We didn't start hearing it be associated with original gangster
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.200]  until B-Real and Dr. Dre and all those guys started talking about the chronic
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.840]  and the OG Kush. So I really think that it came from overgrow.com. Overgrow the
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.920]  government is a website dedicated to cannabis, dedicated to cannabis growing,
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.600]  dedicated to cannabis rebelliousness. It was the home for weed and unfortunately
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.680]  it did lead to a bunch of trouble you guys. We are carried away nowadays with
[09:52.680 --> 09:56.080]  our internet freedom. Back in the day people got raided because of the shit
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.120]  that they did online so keep that in mind. There are people that paid the
[10:00.120 --> 10:03.840]  price for us to be here and a lot of them lost everything because of
[10:03.840 --> 10:09.920]  overgrow.com. So that is my theory. I think that OG Kush was some seeds passed
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.400]  around from overgrow.com and it was a breeding project happening in different
[10:13.400 --> 10:17.240]  locations through the Postal Service. I think that some of the stuff that came
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.280]  out of there was OG Kush and that would explain why there are different phenotypes
[10:22.280 --> 10:27.600]  and different names of OG Kush. The Tahoe OG and the whatever OG and the whatever.
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.240]  We'll say the Tahoe and the Krippie. We got Florida and Tahoe California. I'm
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.480]  not sure what part of fucking Florida the Krippie is from. I'm sure someone's
[10:35.480 --> 10:38.920]  yelling into their fucking device right now saying it's from this part of
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.240]  Florida. But you got the Krippie and you got the Tahoe. They're very similar if
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.000]  you smoke them if you get them near each other. You got the Triangle. Very similar
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.040]  yet very different. They're all similar and all different. They're all OG Kushes
[10:51.040 --> 10:54.240]  because they probably all came from the same seed stock and have been kind of
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.920]  bred somewhere along the line with the same parent and or grandparent. Maybe
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.160]  they're all different F generations. Maybe they're cousins. But I think that
[11:03.160 --> 11:06.440]  that's got something to do with it. It's because of the website. It's because of
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.560]  the mail. I don't think it's ocean grown because how you gonna ocean grow if
[11:11.560 --> 11:14.760]  you're not if you're in LA it's not ocean grown. You're too far. You're
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.000]  fucking smog grown. Alright. And it's not original gangster because the people that
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.400]  were doing it weren't the gangster types. I don't think they would have named it
[11:23.440 --> 11:28.320]  that. So my theory is it came from Overgrow the website. I'd like to hear
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.320]  your rebuttal. I'd like to hear your opinion. I'm curious. Send me an email.
[11:33.320 --> 11:37.880]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. You can find me on Facebook. Just simply
[11:37.880 --> 11:41.360]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. If it's easier for you to find
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.620]  me on Instagram, search for Irie underscore genetics. Also there's the
[11:46.620 --> 11:51.040]  Twitter. You can tweet me at my Twitter. It's at Rasta Jeff 420 or you can tweet
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.920]  the show. It's at GFYH podcast. I would love to hear what you think OG and OG
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.480]  Kush stands for. I'm gonna stand behind my statement. I think it's Overgrow.
[12:01.480 --> 12:06.680]  That's what it was. Alright. You guys, thank you for
[12:06.680 --> 12:10.560]  listening to me ramble. It's been just about 12 minutes. No intro music. No outro
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.720]  music. Just me talking this time. Hey, thanks for hanging out. I really have a
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.720]  lot of fun doing this podcast. I really have a lot of fun doing the Instagram
[12:18.040 --> 12:21.760]  feeds. That is a great time. Thanks to all my friends that kind of helped me
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.360]  name a strain today. I played a little game on Instagram Live where we wrote
[12:25.360 --> 12:28.160]  down strain names and I let people vote on them and I crossed out the ones we
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.440]  didn't like. Of course my vote supersedes all your guys's votes, but I think we're
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.080]  gonna have a good name for Stardog to Arise and I owe a lot of credit to my
[12:36.080 --> 12:38.760]  friends on Instagram Live for that. So if you're not following me on Instagram,
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.000]  please do and check us out. It is a lot of fun. Also, speaking of videos, on
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.800]  YouTube, I've got 242 videos up I think now. I'm slowly making the videos. YouTube
[12:48.800 --> 12:53.320]  has been cracking down on cannabis channels. I'm not going to put up a whole
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.040]  bunch of content for it to get taken down. Let me see what happens in this
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.560]  wave of destruction that's happening through YouTube right now. All of the
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.800]  online services, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Periscope, they have all sent me
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.520]  a new Terms of Service agreement to sign. So things are changing on the internet
[13:11.520 --> 13:14.840]  right now. They're trying to clean up all the smut it sounds like. They're
[13:14.840 --> 13:18.800]  trying to get rid of weed and dirtiness and I don't want to fall victim to it on
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.560]  YouTube. So I'm just gonna kind of lay low for a minute and once it kind of
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.080]  chills out I'll start putting videos up again. I'm caught up on what I wanted to
[13:26.080 --> 13:32.320]  do, so I'm okay for about 35 more videos I think, which will be just fine. Ladies
[13:32.320 --> 13:35.320]  and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out. Thanks for listening. Don't forget about the
[13:35.320 --> 13:37.880]  Patreon campaign. That's right, if you'd like to contribute to the show
[13:37.880 --> 13:41.920]  financially, you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart. All the
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.040]  information that you need will be right there. I do owe huge shoutouts to my
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.240]  friends Roberto, Tyler, and Angel. Thank you for all of the Patreon support. I do
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.040]  appreciate that. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out with me. Thanks
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.480]  for listening to a Thursday Quickie episode. Thanks for all the love and
[13:59.480 --> 14:02.960]  support, you guys. Everybody has been sending me a ton of emails. My Instagram
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.840]  has been blowing up. The Patreon has been staying steady. I do appreciate all of
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.440]  the love, the support, and the interactions. It means the world to me.
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.160]  I'll be back Monday with the full-length episode. I can't wait to hang out with
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.800]  you guys again. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a huge shout out to my
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.480]  friend El Gringo de Mota, and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a
[14:22.480 --> 14:25.080]  hug for me.
