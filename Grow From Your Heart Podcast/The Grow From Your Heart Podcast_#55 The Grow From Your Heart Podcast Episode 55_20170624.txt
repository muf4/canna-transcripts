[03:17.880 --> 03:23.580]  We got a five-star rating again. It says, thanks from Fat Ankle Foot. The comment was
[03:23.580 --> 03:29.580]  left on February 26th. It says, love to listen, getting better with every episode. As someone
[03:29.580 --> 03:33.980]  whose influence is mainly from Soma's book, it's nice to see things turning to more organic
[03:33.980 --> 03:38.580]  based. Been using worms for years. Please keep doing what you're doing and keep up the
[03:38.580 --> 03:44.380]  great work. Well, thanks a lot for the sweet comment, Fat Ankle Foot. I appreciate that.
[03:44.380 --> 03:49.740]  I'm glad that Soma inspired you and started a lot of your teachings because I was hanging
[03:49.740 --> 03:53.220]  out with a friend who grew weed for several years and we were talking about my crops and
[03:53.220 --> 03:56.820]  he said, dude, you know who you really remind me of is a guy named Soma. And at the time
[03:56.820 --> 04:02.020]  I'd never heard of Soma. So I went home and of course I Googled Soma. And Soma and I have
[04:02.020 --> 04:06.700]  a lot of the same philosophies, a lot of the same practices. We agree a lot. So I've learned
[04:06.700 --> 04:12.780]  a lot from Soma. I kind of used some of Soma's methods, but mostly his ideals. He almost
[04:12.780 --> 04:17.820]  treats plants as like a religion sort of, you know, his religion is growing pot. And
[04:17.820 --> 04:21.820]  I took that spiritual aspect of growing pot. I had that before I ever knew about Soma.
[04:21.820 --> 04:26.420]  So I kind of, I multiplied on it or expanded on it once I found Soma. So I'm glad you knew
[04:26.420 --> 04:31.020]  Soma. I'm glad you're a Soma fan and dude, thanks for using worms in your garden and
[04:31.020 --> 04:34.180]  thanks for trying to go organic and thanks for listening and super thanks for the comment
[04:34.180 --> 04:37.880]  and the five stars. You're part of the crew now. So welcome to the crew, Fat Ankle Foot.
[04:37.880 --> 04:42.780]  We appreciate it. I think I read this comment on the last episode, but this one is from
[04:42.780 --> 04:46.820]  Buzzer. Yeah, I read that. It says, thanks for making this for us. Again, dude, you're
[04:46.820 --> 04:52.900]  super welcome. Thanks for listening. So if you guys want to send us a comment, I'd love
[04:52.900 --> 04:56.820]  to read your comments on a future episode. Thanks for the comments for everyone that
[04:56.820 --> 05:00.620]  sent a comment for the new comments and the old ones. Thanks to everybody. If you want
[05:00.620 --> 05:03.620]  to leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher, or if you don't want to leave a comment on
[05:03.620 --> 05:06.660]  iTunes or Stitcher, just send me a tweet. It's grow from your heart. No, it's actually
[05:06.660 --> 05:12.460]  at GFYH podcast. Send me a tweet there or find me on Facebook and I'll respond to you.
[05:12.460 --> 05:15.740]  If you want to say something anonymously, you can send me a personal message and I will
[05:15.740 --> 05:19.340]  keep your name private. Just tell me not to say your name and I won't say it on the
[05:19.340 --> 05:23.980]  show or make up a fake name and I'll say that one. You can also send me an email. It's grow
[05:23.980 --> 05:28.420]  from your heart at hotmail.com. You can let me know if you want your name said or not.
[05:28.420 --> 05:32.060]  I try to be respectful. I know how it is. You can't always tell everybody that you grow
[05:32.060 --> 05:37.940]  cannabis if you don't live in Colorado. All right. That feels like enough intro stuff.
[05:37.940 --> 05:40.540]  I'm going to do a solo episode. I want to talk a little bit about the Rocky Mountain
[05:40.540 --> 05:44.700]  Worm Company. The Rocky Mountain Worm Company was kind enough to give me a tour of the worm
[05:44.700 --> 05:49.820]  farm. I'm also going to talk a little bit about my company, IRI Genetics, and I'll also
[05:49.820 --> 05:54.620]  talk a little bit about Feminize Seeds. I've gotten a lot of emails about Feminize Seeds,
[05:54.620 --> 05:58.100]  so I'll explain my method of making those a little later in the show.
[05:58.100 --> 06:02.700]  Now, let's start with the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. Last week, I was invited to go visit
[06:02.700 --> 06:05.340]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company and they gave me a little tour of the building and I got
[06:05.340 --> 06:10.380]  to see where the worm castings are made. They don't have a giant facility, but what they
[06:10.380 --> 06:15.900]  do have is super clean and super organized and I was pretty impressed. I got to hang out with Jay
[06:15.900 --> 06:20.860]  and Sean and Alan for a few minutes and they taught me a lot about worms and worm castings
[06:20.860 --> 06:24.940]  and why they use specific worms that they use to make the worm castings.
[06:24.940 --> 06:29.340]  Some worms you guys only eat the top layer of, if you put them in a big thing of dirt,
[06:29.340 --> 06:33.740]  like if it's a field of dirt or if it's just a bucket full of dirt, they will only eat the top
[06:33.740 --> 06:38.220]  layer and they don't dig down. These guys actually know which worms eat the top, which worms eat the
[06:38.220 --> 06:42.940]  bottom. They know that some worms will eat every layer. Some worms will travel through all of the
[06:42.940 --> 06:49.180]  dirt or whatever you're putting them in and they will eat and digest all of that. These guys knew
[06:49.180 --> 06:54.220]  a lot about their worms. They showed me worms in every single stage of growth, every single stage
[06:54.220 --> 06:58.620]  of life. They kind of keep the worms in five gallon buckets and they let me open the buckets
[06:58.620 --> 07:03.100]  with the worm farms in them. I get to feel the texture of the medium in which the worms live in.
[07:03.820 --> 07:07.980]  It's kind of airy. It's kind of fluffy. It feels a lot like the soil that I mix for my plants.
[07:08.620 --> 07:12.060]  One thing that I thought was really cool is what they're feeding the worms. This is
[07:12.060 --> 07:19.820]  really cool in my opinion. Parts of the worm diet is dried and ground herb from a company called
[07:19.820 --> 07:27.980]  OpenVape. OpenVape makes vapor pen cartridges. They're extracting the CBD or THC from a plant
[07:27.980 --> 07:33.020]  and making oil out of it. Then they send all the leftover material to the worm company to
[07:33.020 --> 07:39.580]  feed the worms. The worm company is using ground up plant stalks and leaves and whatever else was
[07:39.580 --> 07:44.860]  left for the plants after harvest, after the making oil part happened. They're feeding
[07:44.860 --> 07:50.860]  the ground up plant matter back to the worms. Then the worms are making castings out of that.
[07:50.860 --> 07:56.620]  Those castings are being used to grow my cannabis. Probably those worm castings hopefully make it
[07:56.620 --> 08:02.540]  back to OpenVape and go back into their cannabis. We're kind of doing an in-house recycling sort of
[08:02.540 --> 08:08.380]  thing. It goes full circle without us creating more stuff, without something being tossed into
[08:08.380 --> 08:13.980]  a dumpster for the trash guy to find. Imagine when you harvest, every plant has a stalk and
[08:13.980 --> 08:19.580]  stems and leaves. Imagine if you let that dry, grind it up, and had some worms to feed that to.
[08:19.580 --> 08:22.940]  You wouldn't have to throw all that away. You wouldn't have to make so many trips to the dump
[08:22.940 --> 08:29.580]  or wherever. That's just super efficient. I was completely impressed. Let's see.
[08:30.140 --> 08:34.540]  I want to give a huge shout out to Jay and Sean and Alan and Nick. I really like hanging out with
[08:34.540 --> 08:39.260]  those guys. The Worm Factory is a cool place. I'll definitely be back there soon. Those guys threw a
[08:39.260 --> 08:43.980]  handful of products my way and I'm kind of starting to implement them in my grow. I have to slowly
[08:43.980 --> 08:47.420]  adjust from the organic or from the non-organic bottled stuff to the organics because I don't
[08:47.420 --> 08:51.820]  want to ruin the organic stuff. I'm learning what I can switch out and what I can use together.
[08:51.820 --> 08:56.940]  These guys are definitely, definitely, definitely moving me along quickly. I've been feeding my
[08:56.940 --> 09:01.900]  plants worm castings for about a month now and I can definitely see an improvement in my crops.
[09:01.900 --> 09:07.420]  The first thing I noticed, I would say that after introducing worm castings and GroKoshy, is that my
[09:07.420 --> 09:13.100]  plants are just simply more active. They look more vigorous. They look happier. They're greener. I see
[09:13.100 --> 09:17.500]  more growth and they also seem to want more water, which tells me they're growing and taking nutrients
[09:17.500 --> 09:24.140]  more than before. I definitely encourage the use of GroKoshy and worm castings as a nice way to
[09:24.460 --> 09:30.860]  start leaning toward the organics. I feel like I've been talking about them for a little bit.
[09:32.460 --> 09:36.060]  If you want to learn more about the Worm Company, I definitely recommend you check out
[09:36.620 --> 09:42.700]  their online presence. It's www.RockyMountainWormCompany.com. They're also on Instagram
[09:43.340 --> 09:47.980]  at Rocky Mountain Worm Company. Dude, you will learn a lot from them. If you can stop by their
[09:47.980 --> 09:51.340]  store, check it out. Tell them I sent you. I said that at the beginning, but go there, check it out.
[09:51.340 --> 09:55.340]  It's a great place. So big, huge shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. Love you guys.
[09:55.340 --> 10:00.300]  Can't get enough of that place. The other thing I want to talk about is iRegenetics. I get a
[10:00.300 --> 10:05.340]  couple of emails every week about iRegenetics with questions about iRegenetics stuff. Somebody
[10:05.340 --> 10:11.420]  just asked me why I don't talk about iRegenetics on the podcast. The show isn't really about
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.140]  iRegenetics. The show is about cannabis in general. So I try not to focus too much on my own company,
[10:16.140 --> 10:20.620]  but it seems like you guys are interested. So I guess it seems fair that I talk about it a little
[10:20.620 --> 10:27.090]  bit. I try not to toot my own horn. I'm going to take a sip here. Sorry. Hold on. All right.
[10:27.730 --> 10:33.570]  So let's talk about iRegenetics, I guess. Let's jump into this. iRegenetics is, of course,
[10:33.570 --> 10:39.010]  my seed company. I breed regular and feminized cannabis seeds. Right now, iRegenetics is pretty
[10:39.010 --> 10:43.570]  much sold out of seeds for the most part. Nature's Green Remedies is my main distributor, and they
[10:43.570 --> 10:49.170]  got most of what I had leftover after I hooked up most of my local friends with my latest harvest.
[10:49.170 --> 10:54.210]  I really like to get the locals, all my friends, all my... Colorado. I mean,
[10:54.210 --> 10:58.770]  my company is called iRegenetics Colorado. Colorado is what allowed me to become this
[10:58.770 --> 11:04.290]  breeder. I feel like the local people should get the iRegenetics products first. And that way,
[11:04.290 --> 11:08.050]  I get to see what they grow, and I get to take pictures of it. I can take clones of it.
[11:08.690 --> 11:12.290]  So I'm not trying to be rude about it, but the locals always get served up first.
[11:12.290 --> 11:17.730]  After I feel like everybody's gotten their seeds, make sure Nature's Green Remedies gets what they
[11:17.730 --> 11:23.090]  can do. So I really can't make enough seeds to meet the demand lately, honestly. I'm going to
[11:23.090 --> 11:27.810]  make more Golden Goat and Lemon Jeffery seeds here really soon. The boys for that project are
[11:27.810 --> 11:32.130]  actually in flower. When you make fem seeds or seeds in general, you got to start the boys off a
[11:32.130 --> 11:36.370]  little bit ahead of the females. So the males are in flower now. The girls will go in flower in a
[11:36.370 --> 11:41.970]  couple of few days. Those should be ready in about 90 days from now. I think this episode will come
[11:41.970 --> 11:50.050]  out March 1st or 2nd. And 90 days from then, I should have Lemon Jeffery and Golden Goat seeds
[11:50.050 --> 11:53.490]  available. I actually wrote down the wrong strain, and I almost said the wrong strain and teased you
[11:53.490 --> 11:57.330]  guys. But yes, I'm making more Lemon Jeffery, and I'm making more Golden Goat right now. They should
[11:57.330 --> 12:01.810]  be ready in about 90 days. The locals will get them first. There is no waiting list. There's not
[12:01.810 --> 12:06.770]  a way to get on a waiting list right now. After my locals get served up, they will be dished out
[12:06.770 --> 12:11.730]  to Nature's Green Remedies, and naturesgreenremedies.com will sell out quickly, I promise you.
[12:11.730 --> 12:16.050]  But I'll make an announcement on this show before they go there. So when I make those Lemon Jeffery
[12:16.050 --> 12:21.330]  and the Golden Goats, I'm also going to put a new cut called Kalonji Kush in there. Kalonji Kush is
[12:21.330 --> 12:27.570]  the grateful dog pollinated the Tahoe OG, and I call it Kalonji Kush after a reggae artist named
[12:27.570 --> 12:31.890]  Sizzla Kalonji. If you're wondering where my weird names come from, Kalonji is a reggae artist,
[12:31.890 --> 12:37.330]  Sizzla Kalonji. So I'm going to cross the Golden Goat to the Sizzla Kalonji, and I want to call
[12:37.330 --> 12:43.090]  that Sunshine Girl, which is actually a Sizzla song. So I think that's going to be pretty cute.
[12:43.890 --> 12:47.250]  I have a couple more ideas that I'm going to put in that room. I have two more females that are
[12:47.250 --> 12:51.410]  going in there for sure, but I don't want to talk too much about them until I've got some seeds in
[12:51.410 --> 12:57.330]  my hands from those because, man, let me tell you a weird side story. One time I reversed a
[12:57.410 --> 13:02.130]  Golden Goat plant, a female Golden Goat plant. I treated it. I turned it into a male, and I'll
[13:02.130 --> 13:05.970]  talk more about that later in the show how I do that. But I turned this female plant into a male,
[13:05.970 --> 13:10.770]  right, and it created pollen. And I put that pollen on a room full of plants, and that's how
[13:10.770 --> 13:15.250]  I created the Lemon Jeffery. That's how I made Golden Goat seeds. There was another cross in the
[13:15.250 --> 13:18.850]  room that's never been released or shown to anybody because it only made a few seeds, and those are
[13:18.850 --> 13:25.650]  mine. But I also sprinkled that pollen on another plant. The strain was headband. It was a headband
[13:25.650 --> 13:30.210]  cut that I got from my good buddy, Hanky B. He gave me that headband cut. I sprinkled pollen on
[13:30.210 --> 13:36.850]  it. And when that plant took the pollen, the plant died. Within 24 hours, that plant was dead. Every
[13:36.850 --> 13:40.370]  other plant in the room was healthy and happy. It took the pollen. It showed signs of being
[13:40.370 --> 13:45.650]  pollinated just like it should have. I don't know what went wrong, but that headband plant died
[13:45.650 --> 13:50.610]  within 24 hours of taking feminized pollen. I've never seen that from a plant. I've never heard of
[13:50.610 --> 13:54.690]  that from a plant. I've talked to other breeders. Nobody has an explanation for that. The plant was
[13:54.690 --> 13:58.610]  healthy. Everything was cool. I don't know what the hell happened. I'm going to put another headband
[13:58.610 --> 14:02.290]  in there, and I'm going to hit it with Golden Goat pollen again. I've got a name for it, but I'm
[14:02.930 --> 14:06.770]  hesitant to say it on the show because people are going to rip me off. But if I say it, then no one
[14:06.770 --> 14:11.570]  can steal it from me, right? Because I'm saying it. The Golden Goat is going to pollinate the headband
[14:11.570 --> 14:17.250]  plant, and I will call it the Halo. You see, you got a headband, and now it's gold. It's above your
[14:17.250 --> 14:21.810]  head. That's the Halo, bro. That's what I think. I'm going to call the headband to the Golden Goat
[14:21.810 --> 14:26.850]  the Halo, and the Kalonji Kush to the Golden Goat will be the Sunshine Girl. Those are coming up,
[14:26.850 --> 14:30.130]  you guys, about 90 days, so pay attention. I'll need some testers, but I didn't say that on the
[14:30.130 --> 14:36.370]  show. Let's see. More about iRegenetics. I recently started my work on making black cherry chem F2
[14:36.370 --> 14:43.250]  seeds. F2 is finial generation, so I made the F1s, right? That's plush berry was pollinated by a
[14:43.250 --> 14:48.690]  Daybreaker plant, and the seeds that came out of there were called F1, the first finial generation
[14:48.690 --> 14:55.170]  of that cross. Now, I grew a bunch of them out, and I found the male that I want, and I've recently
[14:55.170 --> 15:00.290]  found three females that are good candidates for breeding. I'm waiting for these plants to finish
[15:00.290 --> 15:05.250]  before I commit to which females I'm going to use to continue the line into F2, but once I choose one,
[15:06.850 --> 15:10.770]  I'm going to choose two of them, actually, and I'm going to hit both of them with the male pollen,
[15:10.770 --> 15:16.770]  and then I will keep all of the seeds separate so that it's phenotype number seven and eight are the
[15:16.770 --> 15:20.850]  two that I'm really eyeballing for my females. So I'll keep black cherry chem seven and black cherry
[15:20.850 --> 15:25.170]  chem eight separate and pull all the seeds out, and I'll grow a hundred of each one of those and
[15:25.170 --> 15:30.610]  see which one shows me what I like, and I will keep that one to continue working with. So I'm
[15:30.610 --> 15:33.970]  waiting for these plants to finish. I got to smoke them. I got to dry them. I got to turn some of it
[15:33.970 --> 15:37.330]  into dabs. I got to smoke some of it as flower. I got to see which one I really like the best,
[15:37.890 --> 15:44.210]  and then that will be used to make the F3, and I'm really trying to stabilize the purple trait
[15:44.210 --> 15:49.330]  in that strain is what I'm trying to do. So I really want... Right now, I'm getting about
[15:49.330 --> 15:55.330]  a little more than 50% purple. When I run a pack of 50, I'll have 25 purple plants.
[15:55.330 --> 16:01.650]  I want to make it up to closer. I want to get like 75% purple plants out of this, and then by the time
[16:01.650 --> 16:06.690]  I'm done, I'd like to see that purple plant come out almost every time is what I'm aiming for.
[16:06.690 --> 16:13.250]  I plan to take it to F5 over the next few years. I'll breed the F2s this summer. One thing I've
[16:13.250 --> 16:17.890]  seen out of it that's really cool is some of the phenotypes look done, and they're only 55 days
[16:17.890 --> 16:24.530]  into flower. So I've made a purple strain with a chem flavor that finishes in about 55 to 65 days,
[16:24.530 --> 16:28.690]  which is pretty cool. So that's my black cherry chem project that's going right now.
[16:29.250 --> 16:34.130]  You can check out pictures of those. I put them on Instagram, and I also put them on my
[16:34.130 --> 16:39.810]  forum on my website. If you go to iRegeneticsColorado.com, go to the forum. It would
[16:39.810 --> 16:43.330]  be really cool if you join the forum. Sign up and join the forum. It doesn't cost anything.
[16:43.330 --> 16:46.450]  Nothing weird is going to happen. You're just a member now, and you can communicate with us and
[16:46.450 --> 16:51.890]  participate. But every week, I go and post a weekly grow journal of my own gardens up there,
[16:51.890 --> 16:55.170]  and the black cherry chem has been highlighted quite a bit. So you can see a lot of great
[16:55.170 --> 17:00.370]  pictures of black cherry chem on my website right now in the forum. Go there and check it out if you
[17:00.370 --> 17:05.970]  can. If you ask me questions there and you talk to me, that's my favorite place to go and communicate
[17:05.970 --> 17:09.730]  with people because they can't censor me because I own that. Facebook can't shut that down or
[17:09.730 --> 17:13.170]  anything. So do what you want to do there. If I think you're a dick, I might tell you to quit
[17:13.170 --> 17:17.330]  being a dick, but man, grow weed and post your weed pictures there. I'd love it. All right.
[17:19.090 --> 17:25.570]  One thing I can talk about is I'm looking for an Arise male. Arise is a golden goat that was
[17:25.570 --> 17:31.410]  pollinated by Daybreaker, and I really love that strain. It makes a great smell. It makes great
[17:31.410 --> 17:37.010]  flavor. The high is amazing. The plants put on super resin. They grow in a good amount of time.
[17:38.210 --> 17:42.690]  They're real stout plants. You don't need a lot of staking on it if you find the right phenotypes.
[17:42.690 --> 17:46.850]  So I'm looking for an Arise male. I want to use Arise in a long-term breeding project. He will be
[17:46.850 --> 17:53.250]  my long-term breeding male. I see some beautiful things from the strain, and I'm sure that a good
[17:53.250 --> 17:57.890]  male will make some more amazing crosses. The resin production from that plant is so impressive,
[17:58.450 --> 18:03.170]  but it'll be a few months before I select an Arise male. I've got the Feminize Golden Goat
[18:03.170 --> 18:08.850]  Lemon Jeffery project ahead of that. I've got the Black Cherry Kim ahead of that, and then after
[18:08.850 --> 18:15.330]  that will be the Arise male selection. I want to find a good Arise male for my permanent breeding
[18:15.330 --> 18:21.730]  stud, but I plan to make 15 to 20 F1 hybrids with Arise to see what works when I do find that one.
[18:22.770 --> 18:25.490]  Then I want to see what can be improved on or what I need to abandon.
[18:26.450 --> 18:31.330]  Because if you breed, if you take a male plant and you hit six or seven female plants with it,
[18:32.530 --> 18:37.410]  don't be afraid to throw away a bunch of seeds. You have to grow those. So you take a male plant
[18:38.050 --> 18:43.010]  in a room with however many females you're going to put in there, five, six, maybe 20 females.
[18:43.010 --> 18:49.250]  You're going to make that many new crosses. You have to grow some of each batch of seeds yourself
[18:49.250 --> 18:52.530]  before you can do anything else with them, unless you give them to your friend and you say,
[18:52.530 --> 18:56.690]  these are untested, dude, because you don't want to put out seeds that you don't know what they're
[18:56.690 --> 19:02.930]  going to do. So get the seeds and grow at least 10, I would say a hundred if you can. I know you're
[19:02.930 --> 19:07.650]  limited on space and things. I like a pheno hunt of a hundred plants. It really shows you what's
[19:07.650 --> 19:13.330]  going to happen, but grow some of those. And if they totally suck, throw them away. I know that
[19:13.330 --> 19:17.810]  sounds crazy, but there are enough strains on the planet to where if you just made some bullshit
[19:17.810 --> 19:23.570]  that doesn't improve the genetic line, throw it away. Why do we need that? Don't be so attached
[19:23.570 --> 19:29.410]  to your new creation that, oh, it's a great strain. It does this. No, it sucks. Throw it away. I've
[19:29.410 --> 19:35.170]  thrown away more strains than I have kept. We all talk about the lemon cush. Everybody had high hopes
[19:35.170 --> 19:41.330]  for the lemon cush that I worked with. That strain sucked. It tasted amazing and it grew big, fat
[19:41.330 --> 19:45.810]  donkey dicks for buds, but you couldn't get high off of it. It would not make resin. None of the
[19:45.810 --> 19:50.930]  phenotypes on that plant made resin. And I don't know why. It was just that cross did not work. So
[19:50.930 --> 19:55.250]  all of the seeds are gone. All of the clones are gone. That project has been abandoned. I realized
[19:55.250 --> 20:00.050]  that's a failed project. It wasted some time, but I don't want to waste more time or more people's
[20:00.050 --> 20:07.890]  time with the same project by sending out shitty seeds. So that's a rant on not being too attachment.
[20:07.890 --> 20:11.330]  It's a lesson in attachment. If you're too attached to that strain, then you're wasting your time
[20:11.330 --> 20:13.890]  growing something that sucks. And you could have been growing something way better. You could have
[20:13.890 --> 20:17.490]  been breeding something that was way better. Just let it go. Sometimes you got to learn to let things
[20:17.490 --> 20:20.850]  go. Remember that lesson I talked about my rig that I dropped? You just got to sweep it up and
[20:20.850 --> 20:27.410]  move on sometimes. All right. So when I do get all these new strains made, I will need help testing
[20:27.410 --> 20:33.570]  these. Like I said, I like to run a hundred myself, but I will also send out a bunch of seeds to
[20:33.570 --> 20:38.450]  reliable testers. The way that I know you're a reliable tester is you've joined my web forum and
[20:38.450 --> 20:43.010]  you have posted pictures of your previous grows on my forum and you stay in contact with me and you
[20:43.010 --> 20:48.050]  show that you're serious about it. That's a lot of how I find my testers is off of my own website.
[20:48.050 --> 20:52.530]  So in the future, if you're interested in testing iRegenetics seeds, it would help you a lot to join
[20:52.530 --> 20:59.170]  the forum. I do play favorites that way. It's my choice. All right. Let's see. I'm not sure what
[20:59.170 --> 21:04.690]  else to say about iRegenetics. I'm the head breeder. I make 99% of the decisions with help
[21:04.690 --> 21:09.010]  from my friends. I do let the people around me kind of give their input because they're cannabis
[21:09.010 --> 21:13.810]  consumers, growers, smokers. They have a lot to say, but that's me. iRegenetics is all Rasta Jeff.
[21:14.770 --> 21:18.130]  I have trim friends that help me. Shout out to everybody that's ever came and helped me trim
[21:18.130 --> 21:21.730]  some iRegenetics stuff or shout out to all the people that have helped me package seeds or
[21:21.730 --> 21:28.050]  whatever. So in the future, I am going to get away from the feminized seed market as much because
[21:28.050 --> 21:34.210]  feminized seeds are a pain in the ass to make. And I think that we should all eventually step up our
[21:34.210 --> 21:39.090]  game and learn to just grow regular seeds. If we didn't have male plants, we wouldn't have more
[21:39.090 --> 21:46.050]  plants anyway. So it's my responsibility to put out more regular seeds, I think, than I do feminized
[21:46.050 --> 21:53.170]  seeds. And I see better shit come from the regular crosses than I do the fem seeds, honestly.
[21:53.170 --> 21:57.330]  Feminized seeds are stuck. You can't improve on them too much. The cross that you make, that's
[21:57.330 --> 22:03.570]  what you got. I see when I cross, if it's feminized, if I cross plant A and plant B,
[22:03.570 --> 22:07.730]  they come out a little bit better than A and B were, but you can't make them super better.
[22:07.730 --> 22:13.570]  If I take a regular male plant and a female plant and cross that, I see much better stuff come out
[22:13.570 --> 22:20.850]  of that, much more improved plants, transgressive segregation. My offspring will outperform each
[22:20.850 --> 22:25.010]  parent. And that only happens when I'm using regular pollen. I can't make that happen with
[22:25.010 --> 22:30.610]  my feminized pollen. So there are a couple of reasons why I will eventually abandon the
[22:30.610 --> 22:34.770]  feminized seeds. That's eventually, I'm not saying soon, but one of these days I will stop
[22:34.770 --> 22:40.290]  making fem seeds. I don't know what else to say about iReGenetics. There's so much I could say,
[22:40.290 --> 22:43.570]  but I feel like I'm just stroking my own ego over here talking about iRe a lot.
[22:44.610 --> 22:50.850]  Support iReGenetics, dude. It's a Rastafarian seed company by a Rasta man. So instead of having
[22:50.850 --> 22:55.330]  mass-produced commercial seeds, you've got seeds. Every seed was touched by me. Every plant was
[22:55.330 --> 23:00.290]  touched by me, by my Rastafarian hands. So it's got a little bit of Rasta love in there.
[23:00.290 --> 23:03.730]  I think that means something to me. I'd rather buy products from a small company
[23:04.370 --> 23:08.530]  that cares about their products than the Walmart of whatever industry you're in.
[23:08.530 --> 23:13.810]  All right. Let's get onto another topic here. I mentioned that I wanted to talk about feminized
[23:13.810 --> 23:20.050]  seeds a little bit. A lot of people seem to have misconceptions on what feminized seeds are,
[23:20.050 --> 23:22.850]  on how they're made, on where they come from, and on what they will do.
[23:23.970 --> 23:26.770]  People think that feminized seeds are straight up hermaphrodite seeds,
[23:27.490 --> 23:32.130]  which I've got a pretty popular seed company that only sold feminized seeds for two years.
[23:32.850 --> 23:37.250]  We came up pretty good. I don't know how iReGenetics would be popular and or reliable
[23:37.250 --> 23:41.490]  if we just sold a bunch of damn herms. Let's start with some basics here. What does it mean
[23:41.490 --> 23:46.610]  to have feminized seeds? I took a few random notes. Feminized seeds mean that the seeds will
[23:46.610 --> 23:52.050]  produce all female plants. I can only say 99% female plants because this is science and nature
[23:52.050 --> 23:57.970]  and shit happens, but they'll be 99% females. This is helpful because new growers don't know
[23:57.970 --> 24:03.090]  how to identify male plants in their gardens. If you're growing feminized seeds, you don't have to
[24:03.090 --> 24:07.730]  watch for the boys. It also makes things easier for growers with limited space because the grower
[24:07.730 --> 24:13.410]  knows that every seed planted will be a usable female and none of their space, soil, nutrients,
[24:13.410 --> 24:17.330]  water, electricity, none of that's going to be wasted on growing a male plant that had to be
[24:17.330 --> 24:22.130]  chopped down 10 days into flower. Feminized seeds mean that all of the seeds will produce
[24:22.130 --> 24:28.530]  female plants. Now, here is where some people are confused. How are feminized seeds made?
[24:28.530 --> 24:33.890]  Pay close attention because honestly, you guys, I'm amazed with myself that I'm giving out this
[24:33.890 --> 24:38.530]  information. This is one of my biggest secrets that I don't usually share with anyone. I'm going
[24:38.530 --> 24:42.610]  to take a dab and a drink before I share this, but I'm going to take a quick dab and a quick drink,
[24:42.610 --> 24:48.530]  and then I will teach you guys how I make reliable feminized seeds on a semi-large scale
[24:49.090 --> 24:54.290]  for Nature's Green Remedies and patients throughout Colorado. Give me a quick second. I'm
[24:54.290 --> 24:59.170]  going to take a dab and a drink. All right, guys, I am back and heavily medicated after that dab.
[24:59.170 --> 25:03.890]  I wanted to tell you how I make my feminized seeds. First of all, I got to warn you that the
[25:03.890 --> 25:08.370]  chemicals that I will describe here are a little bit dangerous and you need to follow the safety
[25:08.370 --> 25:12.530]  rules for these. I am not responsible for you hurting yourself or making yourself sick with
[25:12.530 --> 25:17.810]  these chemicals. I'm simply telling you how I do this. If you do this, follow the instructions,
[25:17.810 --> 25:24.290]  wear gloves, wear goggles, do everything safely. The way I start is I order silver nitrate and
[25:24.290 --> 25:32.210]  sodium thiosulfate from a scientific supply company. I get powdered versions of silver nitrate
[25:32.210 --> 25:38.130]  and sodium thiosulfate. I'm not even going to tell you the dilutions or the rates,
[25:39.410 --> 25:45.730]  but I mix the silver nitrate into an amount of water, and I mix an amount of the thiosulfate
[25:45.730 --> 25:51.170]  into an amount of water. Then I mix those two in another container into another container.
[25:52.370 --> 25:59.250]  Now I've got 100% silver thiosulfate in that third container, and I will dilute that to a certain
[25:59.250 --> 26:05.730]  dilution. Now, some plants will need stronger dilutions of the silver thiosulfate, and some
[26:05.730 --> 26:12.610]  plants will need lighter dilutions of the silver thiosulfate. What I've learned is some plants,
[26:13.250 --> 26:20.050]  I can treat some plants one time with the silver thiosulfate at a high dilution just before flower,
[26:20.050 --> 26:25.090]  the day before flower, and that will work for that plant. Some of them I have to make the dilution
[26:25.090 --> 26:30.450]  much weaker and spray it multiple times, and some plants I have to make it stronger and only
[26:30.450 --> 26:36.050]  spray it once. The only way you'll learn this is through experimentation, by trying plants,
[26:36.050 --> 26:42.210]  by trying different dilutions. I put the silver nitrate into one container of water. I put the
[26:42.210 --> 26:47.010]  thiosulfate into another container of water. I shake them up to where it dissolves. I mix equal
[26:47.010 --> 26:51.570]  amounts into another container, and then I take that container and dilute it to the proper dilution
[26:51.570 --> 26:57.010]  for the plant that I'm working with. Then I will, I'm going to use golden goat because I just did
[26:57.010 --> 27:01.570]  this to golden goat about seven days ago. I took three golden goat plants and I put them in a small
[27:01.570 --> 27:06.770]  space where there aren't any other plants around. There's no wind to where my spray is not going to
[27:06.770 --> 27:11.090]  randomly land on other plants because I don't want to reverse other plants on accident in this
[27:11.090 --> 27:17.010]  process. So I took my three golden goat plants, I put them in a small confined space, and I sprayed
[27:17.010 --> 27:23.490]  them with my silver thiosulfate mix at the proper dilution. I sprayed these plants to the point
[27:23.490 --> 27:28.210]  where they are dripping from top to bottom. These plants were covered in this silver thiosulfate
[27:28.210 --> 27:33.890]  solution. Be careful because if you use the silver thiosulfate at a strong dilution, it may turn
[27:33.890 --> 27:38.290]  things purple, like the floor where the spray lands on, the wall behind it, it may leave
[27:38.290 --> 27:43.490]  little purple marks. So be careful, or a little shiny purple mark, like shiny iridescent looking
[27:43.490 --> 27:46.690]  marks, I think is the word. It's kind of neat the way it looks, but it'll screw some stuff up if you
[27:46.690 --> 27:52.450]  don't want your things purple. Be careful. So spray the plants, then I let them sit and dry
[27:52.450 --> 27:57.570]  because I want them dry before they go in a flower room. So I let the plants dry, then I carry those
[27:57.570 --> 28:02.850]  plants to the flower room where they will go into flower, and I try to spray them right before
[28:02.850 --> 28:07.250]  the lights off for the flowering cycle. So they get sprayed, they dry, and then they go into the
[28:07.250 --> 28:11.730]  flower room and the lights go off and they have now just gone into flower. And with the golden
[28:11.730 --> 28:19.650]  goat, I can spray it one time, the day of flower, and in about 10 days, that plant will show me
[28:19.650 --> 28:26.930]  male flowers. Now, people are saying, how does that work? I got to explain this to you kind of
[28:26.930 --> 28:31.010]  slowly. So pay attention, because I'm trying to explain it to myself. I don't have any notes on
[28:31.010 --> 28:36.530]  this. I'm just freestyling right now. So bear with me. What happens is, when we spray a female plant
[28:36.530 --> 28:43.410]  with silver thiosulfate solution, the thiosulfate acts as a carrier for the silver. The silver isn't
[28:43.410 --> 28:48.210]  really absorbed by the leaves easily, but the thiosulfate makes it get in there a little bit
[28:48.210 --> 28:53.490]  better. So we're tricking the plants into taking the silver by absorbing the thiosulfate. Now,
[28:53.490 --> 28:59.330]  when the silver reaches the plants, the silver disrupts the copper movement in the plant system.
[28:59.330 --> 29:05.490]  There is copper in your plants, yes. The silver will disrupt that. When that copper movement is
[29:05.490 --> 29:10.610]  disrupted in the plant system, it responds by triggering an ethylene production. Or I'm sorry,
[29:10.610 --> 29:14.210]  an ethylene. It triggers an ethylene response. It's not an ethylene production. It's an ethylene
[29:14.210 --> 29:20.290]  response. And that ethylene response tells the plant that something is seriously wrong, and it's
[29:20.290 --> 29:25.410]  time to go into survival mode. So that plant's survival method is to create male flowers that
[29:25.410 --> 29:31.090]  will create pollen, because now all that plant wants to do is shoot pollen and reproduce to keep
[29:31.090 --> 29:36.690]  the species alive. So I've disrupted the copper, the plant's freaking out, it panics. The panic
[29:36.690 --> 29:41.490]  causes ethylene to move through the plant in a weird way. That ethylene triggers the plant to
[29:41.490 --> 29:47.890]  throw out flowers that are male flowers that produce pollen. Now, since those plants, that
[29:47.890 --> 29:52.850]  female plant is all female, it does not have any male chromosomes. The only reason it is showing
[29:52.850 --> 29:59.010]  male sex parts is because I've stressed it and manipulated it. So it will now throw out male
[29:59.010 --> 30:05.650]  parts that contain pollen, and that pollen will be all female. Excuse me, my throat's clogging up
[30:05.650 --> 30:11.170]  here from the dabs. Let me take another drink of water. All right, that should help. So now we've
[30:11.170 --> 30:16.130]  got female plants that are spitting out all female pollen, and we're taking that pollen and of course
[30:16.130 --> 30:22.450]  putting it on female plants. Now, we've never introduced any male pollen here. So like I said
[30:22.450 --> 30:28.050]  before, 99% of those plants should come out female. And the only reason I can say 99% is because,
[30:28.050 --> 30:33.010]  like I said, it's science and nature and shit does happen. And also your grow room can cause
[30:33.010 --> 30:37.890]  issues as well. Your grow style can. I'm not blaming it on you. I'm just saying that environmental
[30:37.890 --> 30:43.570]  factors and all that stuff, plus science and nature, will lead to some screw-ups. And I'll take
[30:43.570 --> 30:47.410]  credit for part of those screw-ups because I'm the one that made the seeds. But when this is done
[30:47.410 --> 30:54.130]  right, we get quality, reliable, feminized seeds. So I hope that makes a little bit of sense.
[30:55.090 --> 31:01.170]  I make the thiosulfate and I spray the plants with it, and magically that makes the plants turn into
[31:02.210 --> 31:06.130]  transsexuals. They're not male plants. They're reversed females is what we call them.
[31:06.930 --> 31:11.890]  And that basically is how I am making feminized seeds. So these are not hermaphrodite seeds. I'm
[31:11.890 --> 31:16.370]  not taking hermaphroditic plants and using hermaphrodite pollen. I'm not doing anything
[31:16.370 --> 31:21.090]  crazy ridiculous. This is reliable science. The reason that a lot of people are afraid of
[31:21.090 --> 31:27.330]  feminized seeds is because when it was started, there were other less reliable practices used to
[31:27.330 --> 31:33.250]  make fem seeds. Soma does another method. Since we talked about Soma earlier in the show, Soma does
[31:33.250 --> 31:39.730]  not use the silver thiosulfate method as often as I do. What Soma does is he lets his plants grow too
[31:39.730 --> 31:44.290]  long. So if he's got a 10-week flowering plant, he'll let it grow about 12 weeks. And when a
[31:44.290 --> 31:49.490]  plant grows that long, it kind of stresses itself, and then it herms out and creates pollen that way.
[31:49.490 --> 31:55.330]  And that's what Soma is using. I've also heard of Soma taking a mature plant, and this sounds
[31:55.330 --> 32:00.050]  completely crazy to a lot of growers, but it'll make sense. He takes a completely mature plant,
[32:00.050 --> 32:04.530]  and then he will light a small fire, and he will put his plant too close to the fire where the
[32:04.530 --> 32:09.490]  plant panics. And the plant feels like it's a forest fire coming. So that plant starts to create
[32:09.490 --> 32:15.570]  male flowers. And it's a female plant. It's freaking out. It's triggering that survival instinct.
[32:15.890 --> 32:19.970]  So it makes those male flowers, which make pollen, and then Soma collects that pollen
[32:19.970 --> 32:25.090]  and sprinkles it onto other plants. And maybe this explains why feminized seeds are so damn
[32:25.090 --> 32:29.490]  expensive, because there are more steps into making feminized seeds than there are to making
[32:30.050 --> 32:34.530]  regular, true-breeding male-female seeds. That's why it's hard for me to keep up, because I have
[32:34.530 --> 32:39.170]  to reverse plants, and I don't get as much pollen from reversing these plants as I do from a normal
[32:39.170 --> 32:45.490]  male. And it takes a little longer. All right. I feel like I told you what I was going to say,
[32:45.970 --> 32:49.090]  about reversing plants. I think you should have caught on by now. Like I said,
[32:49.730 --> 32:52.530]  you're going to have to experiment with the dilutions and the application rates.
[32:54.130 --> 32:57.890]  In Ed Rosenthal's book, I don't have it next to me, The Oakster Damn Course Guide,
[32:57.890 --> 33:02.290]  that Ed wrote the most... I'm not even sure that it's the most current, but Ed Rosenthal wrote
[33:02.290 --> 33:06.850]  an Oakster Damn Course Guide. And in that book, there is a recipe to make your own silver
[33:06.850 --> 33:12.610]  thiosulfate. That recipe does work, although for some plants, it will need some adjusting.
[33:12.690 --> 33:17.970]  That's just my advice. All right. I am going to take a fat dab and take a drink and try to get
[33:17.970 --> 33:21.730]  this frog out of my throat so that I can sound like an actual podcaster. Give me one second.
[33:21.730 --> 33:25.650]  I'll be right back, guys, and we will give some shout-outs and wrap up the show. All right, guys,
[33:25.650 --> 33:29.570]  I'm back. I want to apologize for taking so many breaks on you this episode. Usually, I have some
[33:29.570 --> 33:33.570]  guests that can cover me while I'm coughing and taking a drink or whatever, but today was just me,
[33:33.570 --> 33:38.050]  so you had to bear with me. I apologize. I hope you enjoyed the show. I just took a big old fat
[33:38.050 --> 33:44.450]  dab of some Jack the Ripper Shatter made by my good friends at Turpex. I picked that up at the
[33:45.650 --> 33:50.290]  Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs. I don't shop at a lot of dispensaries because I'm
[33:50.290 --> 33:55.330]  self-sufficient, but I was low on Shatter. I'm just between harvest right now, so I had to pick
[33:55.330 --> 34:01.010]  up a few grams of Shatter. Dude, Green and Healthy Wellness on 212 South 21st Street in Colorado
[34:01.010 --> 34:06.290]  Springs has the hookups on Turpex Shatter. You have to be a medical patient, so if you have a
[34:06.290 --> 34:10.530]  medical card and you were in the Colorado Springs area, shit, if you're in Pueblo or Denver, it's
[34:10.530 --> 34:16.610]  worth the hour drive to head to Green and Healthy Cannabis and pick up your Turpex Shatter. It's a
[34:16.610 --> 34:19.970]  great price. I can't tell you how much it is because they have member pricing, they have
[34:19.970 --> 34:23.410]  non-member pricing, and they have quite a few tiers of pricing. I don't want to get you pumped
[34:23.410 --> 34:29.010]  up because sometimes they run out of the low-pricing stuff, but dude, go to Green and Healthy Wellness
[34:29.010 --> 34:33.490]  in Colorado Springs and get some Turpex. Big shout-out to John and John and Jordan and Jordan.
[34:33.490 --> 34:39.010]  Nothing like a dispensary with two Johns and two Jordans in it. All right. Also, I want to give a
[34:39.010 --> 34:43.090]  big shout-out to my friend Claude the Candyman. Claude, if you're listening to this show, bro,
[34:43.090 --> 34:47.970]  big thanks, much respect. Guys, support Sweet Stone Candy. If you are in California, you can
[34:47.970 --> 34:52.450]  get your Sweet Stone Candy. I don't think it's available here in Colorado anymore, but much love,
[34:52.450 --> 34:57.330]  much respect to Claude the Candyman. Big shout-out to Sweet Stone Candy. Also, a big hug to Melissa
[34:57.330 --> 35:01.890]  and a little scratch on the head to Sticky the Dog. Shout-out. Also, big huge shout-out to my
[35:01.890 --> 35:06.210]  buddy Hunt. I always owe you a big shout-out, bro. You need to come on the show. Grimey Gatsby on the
[35:06.210 --> 35:11.170]  podcast. That's what I'm saying. We are having a growers meeting, you guys. We do these growers
[35:11.170 --> 35:16.690]  meetings in the back of Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Jesse gets a topic started, and then I
[35:16.690 --> 35:21.010]  will jump in and help him give a little grow lesson. I think we're going to talk about...
[35:21.810 --> 35:25.410]  Oh, no, that's old. I don't even know what the topic is this week. I should text him and find
[35:25.410 --> 35:32.050]  out. We're going to have a meeting. The meeting is on March 6th at 6 p.m. at Hygro Indoor Growing
[35:32.050 --> 35:36.690]  Supplies. I'm grabbing the paper with the address right now because I don't remember the address. I
[35:36.690 --> 35:42.690]  do remember, but I don't want to say it wrong. It is 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[35:42.690 --> 35:47.490]  You were invited. That's right. You were invited. If you're listening to this podcast,
[35:47.490 --> 35:51.730]  I think you have to be 21 and over. It's a 21 and over event. If you're listening to the show and
[35:51.730 --> 35:56.370]  you're 21 and up, you can come to this event. It's at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, March 6th
[35:56.370 --> 36:01.730]  at 6 p.m. I will be there. Jesse will be there. There's a good chance Sean King-Cola will be there.
[36:02.610 --> 36:07.010]  Sometimes Smince shows up. Garden of Weeden comes. There will be a lot of cool people there.
[36:07.010 --> 36:11.010]  Sometimes we give away prizes. They give away prizes. It's not my event. I just help out.
[36:12.050 --> 36:16.050]  Big shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies for that. I sound like I'm going to start coughing
[36:16.050 --> 36:19.090]  again. I feel like I have a big coughing fit coming, so I'm going to try to wrap up the show
[36:19.090 --> 36:23.090]  pretty quickly. Just a short episode. You guys seem to pay more attention when the episodes are
[36:23.090 --> 36:29.090]  shorter. I honestly get more completed listens to episodes under 45 minutes, so we might start
[36:29.090 --> 36:35.250]  doing that. If you have a show idea, message me. I'd love to hear your show ideas. This show came
[36:35.250 --> 36:40.290]  all out of emails that I received from listeners. I made this show just for you because of your
[36:40.290 --> 36:44.130]  questions. If you want to hear something, let me know. Don't feel shy. Don't feel like you're
[36:44.130 --> 36:48.850]  begging. I will do a show based on what you want to hear because this show is for you, not me.
[36:49.570 --> 36:53.090]  All right. I'm going to close the show up. Thanks for listening to another episode. I'll be back in
[36:53.090 --> 36:57.490]  another week. Hey, I said that the Dragonflight Earth Medicine people were coming. It turns out
[36:58.530 --> 37:03.490]  our schedules missed each other. They are in Washington up near Canada right now. I may set
[37:03.490 --> 37:08.850]  up a Skype interview, but I never ... When podcasts do Skype and phone interviews, I usually don't
[37:08.850 --> 37:13.090]  listen because it sounds like shit. Unless I can get a really quality recording out of it,
[37:13.090 --> 37:16.450]  I won't do it to tell you the truth. I'll wait for them to come to Colorado,
[37:16.450 --> 37:20.610]  and I will interview them in person. I hyped you guys up that the Dragonflight Earth Medicine
[37:20.610 --> 37:24.690]  people are coming. There was a miscommunication. They are currently in Washington. I am in
[37:24.690 --> 37:29.570]  Colorado. Yeah, you heard me. If I can make it happen through a good phone interview, I will.
[37:29.570 --> 37:33.330]  If it's not quality, I will never play it because I hate it when I hear a crappy phone interview on
[37:33.330 --> 37:39.810]  a podcast. I'm going to try to get Sean and Jesse back for a soil recycling episode really soon.
[37:39.810 --> 37:43.250]  I've got a lot of cool stuff lined up. The Cannabis Cup is coming up here pretty soon.
[37:43.250 --> 37:47.250]  Actually, it's my birthday right now, so I got a lot of fun shit happening this week.

[39:59.970 --> 40:04.210]  had a great time with you this week. Had a great dinner last night. You guys are kicking ass.
[40:05.490 --> 40:09.890]  Yeah, everybody, thanks for listening. Until next time, take a big fat dab and give your mama a hug
[40:09.890 --> 40:16.610]  for me. We used to aim for the sky. Now we higher than Mars. On the rise till we shine like the fire
[40:16.610 --> 40:26.010]  of stars. Son, I create, you would burn out. Linus keeps coming out with the slamming beats. Makes
[40:26.010 --> 40:31.370]  the whole house want to bounce like static sheets. We the track elite, world star athletes, and you
[40:31.370 --> 40:36.650]  can't compete because your rap is weak. Have a seat. My numbers game is uncontained by a data sheet.
[40:36.650 --> 40:41.770]  I run the game while you drag your feet. I'm unashamed with my love for fame because my life
[40:41.770 --> 40:48.250]  was mundane. Now it's feeling magnifique. First place and we moving above. Fluid and love under
[40:48.250 --> 40:54.010]  the influence of drugs. You speak hate, we could ruin your mob. Owe you the balls, I could squash
[40:54.010 --> 40:59.210]  you like a bob. Do it again. Do it then. Do it again. Because the moment that you stop is when
[40:59.210 --> 41:01.530]  the movement will end. So do it again.
