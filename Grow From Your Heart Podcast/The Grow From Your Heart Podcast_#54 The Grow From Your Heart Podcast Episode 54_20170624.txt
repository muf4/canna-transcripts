[00:16.440 --> 00:22.080]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 53, 54 of the Grow
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.080]  From Your Heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're
[00:27.080 --> 00:30.960]  a new grower, a professional grower, if you're a new smoker, if you're a veteran dabber,
[00:30.960 --> 00:33.920]  if you're a cannabis activist, or even if you're just someone who's curious about the
[00:33.920 --> 00:38.040]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. Welcome. Roll up a
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.240]  fat joint, grab a dabber. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. We are joined today by King Kolo once
[00:42.240 --> 00:43.240]  again. Welcome back, bro.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.240]  Thanks for having me, man.
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.000]  His real name is Sean. We'll call him King Kolo. We'll call him Sean. We'll alternate
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.080]  between the two. He's got an alter ego. He's like a superhero and shit over here.
[00:50.080 --> 00:51.080]  It works for me.
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.480]  He's the organic as fuck superhero.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.480]  Ras Kola.
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.080]  Sitting across the table from me is our good buddy, Jesse. Welcome back, bro.
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.080]  Hey, thank you.
[00:58.080 --> 01:01.040]  Man, dude, thanks for coming. We're going to let Jesse talk a lot on this episode.
[01:01.040 --> 01:02.040]  Ah, shit.
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.320]  Well, yeah, you have a lot of good shit to say.
[01:04.320 --> 01:06.240]  You showed up with the sheets, man.
[01:06.240 --> 01:09.760]  Yeah, Jesse brought notes and shit. This is going to be good. So thanks for coming, guys.
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.240]  On time and everything, I appreciate it. As always, I need to give a big shout out to
[01:13.240 --> 01:16.640]  the Mystic Roots man for letting me play their music on the show. Big, huge thanks
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.440]  to Kat and Ku and the Mystic Roots crew. I usually do an ad, but Sean just said something
[01:21.440 --> 01:27.360]  that really got my attention here. He said that NPK value no longer matters to him. Would
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.240]  you like to elaborate that now that I've got some microphones turned on?
[01:30.240 --> 01:38.240]  Yeah. So I think NPK with organic, true organic gardening isn't a necessity. That's something
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.240]  that is NPK value is all synthetic. It was invented for synthetic fertilizers.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.240]  Okay.
[01:45.240 --> 01:46.240]  As a way to sell them.
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.960]  Exactly. You know, you're just giving the plant what they need when they need it. And
[01:52.960 --> 01:57.840]  the reason I brought this up to you is I actually saw a post earlier today and it was out of
[01:57.840 --> 02:00.400]  a publication. I'll just read it for you real quick.
[02:00.400 --> 02:02.240]  Do it. Give credit to who it is.
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.440]  Okay. So this is Plant and Prosper. He's a really cool guy. If you don't follow him
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.480]  on Instagram, it's plant underscore in underscore prosper. I saw him throw this up earlier.
[02:14.480 --> 02:23.480]  It's Justin Von Liebig. He's actually credited with creating synthetic fertilizers. So here's
[02:23.480 --> 02:28.680]  a little excerpt that Plant Prosper posted from a book that he was reading. NPK gardeners
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.440]  owe their practices to the great scientist, Justin Von Liebig, the father of artificial
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.280]  fertilizers. What most don't know is that later in life, Von Liebig acknowledged a grave
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.320]  mistake in relying only on chemistry. In fact, he saw negative impacts of artificial fertilizers
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.580]  on life in the soil and his own vegetable garden and thereafter preferred organic matter
[02:48.580 --> 02:54.280]  to inorganic chemical fertilizer he invented. To quote Von Liebig, after I learned the reason
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.320]  why my fertilizers weren't effective in the proper way, I was like a person that received
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.320]  a new life. Understanding how nutrients will make us work, will make us all see the light
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.800]  and then ultimately make us better gardeners with more sustainable gardens. Sorry, kind
[03:08.800 --> 03:09.920]  of butchered that at the end.
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.440]  Oh no, that's pretty much been your message the whole time anyway. Is it the synthetics
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.360]  are disrupting the eco life, the organic life and the plants and that we need to get away
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.760]  from that. And have I said on the show that you brought me a bokashi bucket? Have I said
[03:23.760 --> 03:24.760]  that yet?
[03:24.760 --> 03:27.040]  No. Last show I mentioned I was going to bring it to you.
[03:27.240 --> 03:29.960]  Okay, well I got to give you a big thanks for that one. Big thanks and shout out to
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.320]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. Sean brought me a bokashi bucket so I'm one step closer
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.000]  to becoming organic as fuck.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.360]  Hell yeah. I ordered one last week too.
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.040]  Sweet. Let me know how it goes. We'll bokashi together. We'll be bokashi buddies.
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.040]  Bokashi bros.
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.400]  Hey, don't say that out loud. It's not a little weird.
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.440]  All the growers are like, sounds fun. Everybody else is like, what the hell are those guys
[03:51.440 --> 03:52.440]  doing?
[03:52.440 --> 03:53.440]  I'm going to bokashi with Jeff.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.440]  We got to go to a bokashi class.
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.440]  What?
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.040]  It's like the purple kalonji.
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.160]  Purple Kalonji club. Mine's turning purple too. I took a lot of pictures today. Shout
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.480]  out to the Kalonji Kush. That's a sweet strain. So what were you saying about the NPK?
[04:06.480 --> 04:14.080]  So yeah, basically NPK was created with synthetic fertilizers. It's kind of the basis behind
[04:14.080 --> 04:18.520]  it. You give plant nitrogen when it needs it. You give the plant phosphorus and potassium
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.160]  when they need it or when you think they need it and you bypass this natural process. And
[04:24.240 --> 04:31.600]  by doing that, when you bypass this process, basically you're just leaving the salts, the
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.960]  mineral salts and everything that's left over from the fertilizer that's not immediately
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.120]  taken up by the plant's roots. You're leaving that in the dirt because you've bypassed all
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.840]  natural chemistry. It's not being digested. It's not being broken down. It stays there.
[04:43.840 --> 04:49.840]  It's like what you were saying about CO2 and synthetic rooms in the last episode.
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.360]  Yeah, there's nothing that... I'm going to have some numbers on that.
[04:54.080 --> 04:59.520]  That's basically if I just drank Gatorade all day or something salty all day. I can't say
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.680]  Gatorade because they'll sue the shit out of me. But if I just put salt water all day,
[05:03.680 --> 05:06.640]  that's essentially what we're feeding the plants by feeding them synthetic nutrients.
[05:06.640 --> 05:12.560]  Exactly. You'll pee out the water, but the salts stay in there. It's not good for you. It's not
[05:12.560 --> 05:17.040]  good for the plant. Someone's going to say, but I flush heavily, but you don't flush often enough,
[05:17.040 --> 05:21.280]  I don't think. Even if you get run off, that salt is still binding to you because your plant has to
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.800]  metabolize it. What it does metabolize is still coming out of the roots as well. You've got the
[05:26.800 --> 05:30.720]  extra buildup you put in there. You got the part that was never used. Then you got the part that
[05:30.720 --> 05:33.600]  was metabolized. You got a lot of salt stuck in there using the synthetics.
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.440]  Well, then it also forms the plant too. It's in the plant materials as well.
[05:38.160 --> 05:40.000]  Yeah. You got to smoke those salts, right?
[05:40.000 --> 05:40.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:41.360 --> 05:41.920]  Salts.
[05:41.920 --> 05:44.880]  What are you rolling up, dude? Because you're a couple feet away from me and that shit smells
[05:44.880 --> 05:45.840]  delicious over here.
[05:45.840 --> 05:46.960]  I swear it's getting stronger.
[05:47.520 --> 05:50.400]  I think that I brought the Wi-Fi Tahoe.
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.720]  Wi-Fi Tahoe smells delicious. Did you grow that?
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.080]  No. No, I picked it up from a local shop up in the Springs.
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.480]  Nice. Shout out to that local shop in the Springs. Good work.
[05:59.120 --> 06:07.760]  But yeah, so with the MPK, we don't rely on the numbers. We rely on more of what it's called the
[06:07.760 --> 06:15.760]  nutritive cycle theory. So it's the plant, it's kind of like a person. The plant's a baby. It's
[06:15.760 --> 06:23.280]  growing. It needs things to aid in its vegetative growth. So that's where your nitrogen comes in.
[06:23.280 --> 06:30.320]  That's where your potassium comes in to help strengthen those cell walls as your plants get
[06:30.320 --> 06:35.600]  bigger to make sure that everything's going properly. Instead of giving the plant directly
[06:35.600 --> 06:40.160]  what it needs, what we'll do is we'll let the plant decide for itself. All of those things will
[06:40.160 --> 06:44.240]  be available in the soil and not in the sense that we're going to load it down with alfalfa
[06:44.240 --> 06:52.720]  meal or bone meal or blood meal, but the soil will have an MPK value. Usually, I calculated last time
[06:52.720 --> 06:59.840]  and just with the real basic mix of neem and Karaja and kelp meal and things like that, I think we
[06:59.840 --> 07:04.560]  were running around like a three to four is kind of what the fertilizer quote unquote was coming out.
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.320]  That's fairly low. I'm sure that plant got everything it needed.
[07:08.320 --> 07:13.280]  Yeah. And that's where we come from. That's the reason that when you go to the growth store,
[07:13.280 --> 07:20.960]  you'll see that organic fertilizers are like zero or 1.23 or these extremely low numbers.
[07:20.960 --> 07:26.720]  And people see that and they're like, oh, the other one says 0.060. That's going to yield me
[07:26.720 --> 07:35.760]  way more. And that's a common misconception. It's not... I mean, you will get bigger buds
[07:35.760 --> 07:38.480]  using that. They're not going to be the tastiest or the cleanest in the world.
[07:38.480 --> 07:41.920]  If I ate a bunch of pennies, I would feel full, but I'd just shoot out a bunch of pennies.
[07:41.920 --> 07:42.320]  Exactly.
[07:42.320 --> 07:44.080]  And I wouldn't get anything from it.
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.520]  I'll argue that you're not necessarily going to get bigger buds from it.
[07:48.320 --> 07:48.960]  Right.
[07:48.960 --> 07:57.760]  A lot of the 0.060, that sounds like a powdered bloom booster. And those things can really
[07:57.760 --> 08:02.400]  fuck your plant up in a hurry if you try to go too crazy with them. Yeah.
[08:04.480 --> 08:10.560]  Yeah. Like I said, as far as the whole MPK thing, I wouldn't stress it. I'd make sure that when you
[08:11.200 --> 08:17.680]  go into your cycle, make sure your soil's amended properly and then make sure that you're feeding it,
[08:18.480 --> 08:21.040]  beneficial bacteria, that it's getting everything it needs.
[08:23.840 --> 08:29.120]  It'll have alfalfa in it, it'll have kelp in it. If you need that booster, you can always top dress
[08:29.120 --> 08:35.360]  with like a fish bone meal or make a nettle tea or a yarrow tea. There are many different options.
[08:35.360 --> 08:41.600]  And those, while they may not be high in MPK, that's what they're predominant with. And that's
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.480]  going to get the... You enter that into the soil, that's going to get the bacteria and the fungi
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.960]  cycling whatever nutrient you just ingested, you entered into the soil. So they're just going to
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.800]  keep carrying on that process and keep delivering it to your plant as your plant needs it.
[08:55.840 --> 09:00.080]  Does your plant know when to stop eating at that point? It'll be like, oh, so you can't,
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.480]  you're not, you don't run as much risk of burning it with the organics is something I've noticed.
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.680]  Yeah. Well, when I was, when I really kind of first got into it, I kept getting a lot of nitrogen
[09:09.680 --> 09:15.040]  deficiencies at the beginning of flower. I mean, like every ran I did organic, it would just,
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.400]  for some reason I would just get these yellow ass leaves, you know, week three and it just, it sucked.
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.360]  Trying to follow your feed to keep up and do everything you can to chase it. Yeah. But in
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.840]  week three, if you're already yellow and it's, it's a lost race. And I thought that it was because,
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.720]  you know, I wasn't feeding the plant enough nitrogen. And that wasn't necessarily the case
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.520]  where I really saw the improvement was when I dialed my amendments back. You know, when I really
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.680]  slowed things down and was like, okay, I'm not going to pound it with stuff. I'm going to
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.640]  make sure that the, you know, soil food web's alive, that everything's cycling how it needs to,
[09:50.640 --> 09:57.360]  that everything is working and we'll let the plant decide for itself. And yeah, I mean, I haven't,
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.440]  I haven't seen, you know, any more, I haven't dealt with the deficiency in a while. I will say that.
[10:03.440 --> 10:10.560]  I don't, I haven't ran comparisons. I don't run when I, I don't run traditional growth. So,
[10:10.560 --> 10:14.480]  I can't say that this is what I'm, you know, you're going to yield compared to this. I only
[10:14.480 --> 10:24.000]  do my own thing. Sorry. I just trans, I just made the switch back to full organics in my indoor
[10:24.000 --> 10:33.680]  grows. I had been using bottled nutrients and my, my first, I took the clones, my first set of
[10:33.680 --> 10:40.080]  plants that we transplanted into a good soil and everything. We never fed them any bottled
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.720]  nutrients or anything like that. So, there wasn't any flushing involved, but I use the soil mix.
[10:46.720 --> 10:53.520]  That was pretty much what I'd been using previously when I grew indoors and I nitrogen
[10:53.520 --> 11:02.160]  burned some of them. I think the first half of the plants I transplanted used one amount of
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.760]  all the inputs and I got yellowing instantly. And, you know, a lot of people could have been
[11:07.760 --> 11:12.400]  like, Oh, that's lack of nitrogen, but I already knew there was a shit ton of nitrogen in there.
[11:12.400 --> 11:19.520]  So, the next night when we transplanted the other half of the plants, I just cut the amount in half
[11:19.520 --> 11:26.240]  and use the half amount of everything. And those plants just exploded instantly. And they're still
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.760]  outgrowing, you know, that's been three weeks ago and they're still outgrowing the plants that we
[11:31.760 --> 11:36.400]  transplanted the first night. So, go easy with the organics because they're bioavailable.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.800]  The plants are, that's right there. The plants can eat it. You don't have to,
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.680]  yeah, they don't have to do as much work to eat that. So, you can speed them up too much by
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.040]  overfeeding them with a lot of these organics. And that's something we're talking about with one of
[11:47.040 --> 11:53.120]  our favorite products is OGT. And Sean was teaching me how OGT can kind of speed up the metabolism of
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.880]  your plants a little bit too much. So, go easy on the OGT guys. I've been recommending that a lot.
[11:57.840 --> 12:00.480]  Replace that with Rocky Mountain Worm Castings if you're able to.
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.800]  Sean Gillespie I was wondering when I heard,
[12:02.800 --> 12:10.080]  I listened to the podcast last night, but was wondering if that could be useful in flushing
[12:10.080 --> 12:11.120]  in any way. Yeah.
[12:11.120 --> 12:14.000]  Chris Steininger Yeah, it can. It actually absolutely could.
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.120]  Sean Gillespie That makes a lot of good sense.
[12:15.120 --> 12:18.160]  Chris Steininger I know you're a super huge fan of OG BioR.
[12:18.160 --> 12:24.640]  I started using them here recently. I am so impressed with OG BioR. Holy hell. I mean,
[12:24.640 --> 12:32.320]  I'm talking just from the standpoint of the plant's overall health. I mean, I haven't seen
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.240]  a damn yellow leaf. I haven't, everything's green and waxy. It's pretty cool. I mean,
[12:38.800 --> 12:43.920]  but that goes to the new pack. I read somewhere that somebody had actually mentioned
[12:44.480 --> 12:47.600]  hitting it because you're only supposed to use the nutrient pack, I believe three times
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.280]  throughout the whole cycle. But I heard him about introducing it a fourth time.
[12:51.280 --> 12:52.240]  Sean Gillespie Into flush.
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.840]  Chris Steininger Yeah, about like, or not even into flush. I think they were saying like around
[12:55.840 --> 13:02.000]  like week, you know, a couple of weeks before flush actually like really start cycling in. But
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.800]  yeah, I mean, that's definitely something worth looking into. It's a great idea.
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.320]  Aaron Ross You guys are going to have to start taking
[13:06.320 --> 13:10.720]  a lot of notes on these next few episodes. I'm going to have Sean back. Sean wants to do a full
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.840]  episode on recycling soil and reamending your soil. We had a listener ask specifically about
[13:15.840 --> 13:17.600]  that. We're going to get to that one. Sean Gillespie
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.640]  That's always been. Chris Steininger
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.720]  Thanks Fastberry. I don't know who you are, but you follow you're an awesome person. We really
[13:24.720 --> 13:29.120]  appreciate you listening and appreciate your input. And I do want to let Jesse talk a little
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.280]  bit or a lot actually about he wants to talk about light deprivation. My brain is blank today. He
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.960]  wants to talk about light deprivation and getting a head start on the outdoor season. Sean's got a
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.320]  bomb he wants to drop. I'm not sure. Do you want to drop it now or do you want to put people in
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.240]  suspense and give this new idea? Sean Gillespie
[13:50.240 --> 13:52.880]  I think that we'll bring it out on the next episode.
[13:52.880 --> 13:54.480]  Chris Steininger On the next time that Sean comes over,
[13:54.480 --> 13:58.880]  he's going to talk about reamending recycled soils, and then he's got a bomb to drop on the
[13:58.880 --> 14:00.720]  entire growing world. Sean Gillespie
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.600]  You're going to either hate me or you're going to love me, but we're going to change the way
[14:05.600 --> 14:10.080]  you think about a certain item that most people are using regularly in their lineup.
[14:10.080 --> 14:11.440]  Chris Steininger Everybody that I know is.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.520]  Sean Gillespie Everybody's using regularly in their lineup.
[14:13.520 --> 14:20.160]  I use it regularly in my lineup. I just learned this too, so I'm guilty of it as well.
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.800]  Chris Steininger We'll probably give you two weeks to study
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.160]  up on it. We'll probably skip you on it one episode just because we don't want you too many
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.800]  times so you don't get stale and expected. You just ash around on the table, bro. Perfect,
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.600]  it fell anyway. I'm too lazy to get up and get an ashtray. Then we'll have you back and we'll
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.840]  let you drop that bomb on the show and disrupt everybody's growing methods. I've got to do a
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.720]  couple of commercials because I did not do them and we're about to let Jesse talk a lot. Our first
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.080]  ad is from naturesgreenremedies.com. Visit naturesgreenremedies.com for Gage Green Genetics,
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.960]  La Plata Labs, Sin City, Rare Dankness, Mile High, Canaventure, The Cali Connection, MTG,
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.000]  iReed Genetics, and many, many more trusted brands. I'm not sure what the coupon code is
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  for this month. I'll try to update you in the next episode, but make sure you check them out.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.800]  Jesse Gillespie I saw a coupon code. Sorry to interrupt you
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.720]  for that. No, go for it. Let's hear it. I can't remember what it was, but it was 25%
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.800]  off and that's a hell of a fucking deal. Yeah, it is. If you can find that coupon code. Someone
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.480]  on Instagram was talking about it. There you go. Make sure you check out naturesgreenremedies on
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.360]  Instagram. It's like green remedies nature or nature's green or something because Instagram
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.160]  is kind of a bitch and they've been killing people's pages. So, all right, check them out.
[15:32.160 --> 15:34.960]  Shout out to Yankee. I'm sorry I don't have a coupon code for you. I got to figure out the
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.920]  date that this show posts because if this goes out after February, which I think it does, then I need
[15:39.920 --> 15:42.960]  a new coupon code. That's all I'm doing here. I'll try to post one up at the end of the show.
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.400]  I'll make a note. Code is what I'm writing. Since Jesse's here, this podcast is also brought to you
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.160]  by our good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Check out Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[16:16.960 --> 16:20.880]  and they will give you commercial pricing. I wish I had some cool effects for that.
[16:20.880 --> 16:24.320]  Under an entire order, yes, there you go. Your whole order, you'll get commercial pricing.
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.480]  That saves you a few bucks, dude. It definitely saves you some money. If you're buying a big bag
[16:28.480 --> 16:34.880]  of soil, it definitely chops down the price. I used it today myself. Saved myself four and a
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.680]  half bucks on a bag of soil. See? Four and a half bucks counts. It makes it cheaper than everywhere
[16:39.760 --> 16:45.040]  else. Yeah, that coupon code is actually better than the employee discount I'm supposed to give
[16:45.040 --> 16:51.520]  myself. Sweet. Also, big shout out to Rocky Mountain Worm Company. If you're looking to move
[16:51.520 --> 16:56.960]  to organics, more sustainable gardening, a better way of growing, a healthier, safer way of farming,
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.040]  a way that will last forever, you'll be able to eliminate those plastic bottles, eliminate a lot
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.600]  of water shipping, a lot of waste. You'll be self-sufficient. Check out the Rocky Mountain
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.720]  Worm Company. If you have questions about that, check out it's at King Cola on Instagram. How do
[17:10.720 --> 17:17.600]  you spell it actually? It's at K-I-N-G underscore C-O-L-A. I knew there was an underscore. There's
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.840]  an underscore between the words and at the end. So make sure you check that out. But big shout
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.600]  out to the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. They're now an official sponsor for the show. I will write
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.480]  them a really super ad. I'm just not sure how to advertise that yet. All the ads sound the same,
[17:30.480 --> 17:33.920]  to tell you the truth. And they're great guys, too. They're great dudes. We're going to get them
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.400]  back on the show. In the future, we're going to have the guys from, I shouldn't even tease you
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.800]  yet, the Dragonfly Earth Medicine people are going to be on the show pretty soon also. So we got a
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.040]  lot of cool stuff. Hunt, Grimey Gatsby, I hope you're listening, dude. It's time for you to come

[18:20.560 --> 18:25.920]  there. Do that, do that, do that. Thanks a lot. So I think it's time to let Jesse talk about light
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.560]  deprivation. He's got a lot of notes over there. Do you want me to just let you go about it? Do you
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.680]  want me to ask you a couple of questions I had written down? How do you think is cool?
[18:35.680 --> 18:39.360]  You got a good starting point? Yeah, I got a good starting point. Well, then get started, bro.
[18:40.480 --> 18:44.960]  Here comes Jesse. I actually don't have as many notes as it looks like. I haven't even read most
[18:44.960 --> 18:50.560]  of this stuff. This is just- It's really big print. It is pretty big. This top paragraph
[18:50.560 --> 18:54.400]  or three is the important part. This was written by
[18:57.440 --> 19:02.320]  either Eric or Jonathan from Forever Flowering Greenhouses. Sweet. I was going to shout them
[19:02.320 --> 19:08.080]  out. Yeah, yeah. They're great guys, great products. And I found it on a website called
[19:08.080 --> 19:19.040]  the ganjiair.com, which is also a great website. Joint break. So light deprivation, this is just
[19:19.040 --> 19:25.040]  a definition. The weed tastes good. Yeah, I can taste the Tahoe in there for sure. Yeah.
[19:26.960 --> 19:34.560]  I was having trouble and I've always had trouble explaining light depth to some people. So I will
[19:34.560 --> 19:40.720]  use someone else's definition of it. Light deprivation, aka light depth, is the process
[19:40.720 --> 19:46.800]  of forcing plants to flower with sunlight in a time of year that is not normally the flowering
[19:46.800 --> 19:53.680]  period of the sun's natural light cycle. Similar to controlling the light cycle with the grow light
[19:53.680 --> 19:59.440]  by turning it on and off with the timer, farmers can control the budding cycle by blocking the
[19:59.440 --> 20:07.520]  sunlight and making the plants think it's time to flower. Typically this is done with a hoop house
[20:07.520 --> 20:17.680]  or greenhouse of some kind. However, it's not actually necessary. And shit, I forgot I lost my
[20:17.680 --> 20:21.760]  track. All right. So I'll recap a little. I'll recap a little while you catch up. Basically what
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.520]  we're trying to do, we want to grow outside, but we want to get a little bit of a jump on the outdoor
[20:25.520 --> 20:31.600]  season before the police and thieves go looking for the outdoor crops. So our trick is to build
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.680]  a greenhouse outside or a hoop house, which I'll let Jesse explain how to build a hoop house. He's
[20:35.680 --> 20:43.040]  our construction guy. He's got a beard. And a hammer. And a truck. So basically what we need to do, we
[20:43.040 --> 20:49.280]  want to put our plants outside and outside, we'll put them out early before we get to our flowering
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.760]  cycle that nature gives us with the sun, the sun cycles. The photo period is what makes these plants
[20:53.760 --> 20:59.120]  flower. So we're going to trick them. We're going to cover up our outdoor greenhouse or hoop house.
[20:59.120 --> 21:03.920]  We're going to cover that up every day at the same time and let them sleep for 12 hours and then
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.480]  uncover it every morning at the same time so that these plants are tricked into thinking that
[21:08.480 --> 21:14.400]  the season has changed to fall and it's time for them to flower. So maybe we can do this with the,
[21:14.400 --> 21:18.240]  if you schedule it right, you can get these going four weeks, maybe three or four weeks before
[21:18.240 --> 21:24.320]  everybody else is in flower. You can pull off one crop before everybody else and that shit won't get stolen.
[21:24.320 --> 21:30.160]  Here you can, uh, shit, I have it all figured out because I'm doing it myself. Um, if you put your
[21:30.160 --> 21:37.200]  plants out April 25th here, you will harvest, um, July 30th. I want to say, wow, that's early. Yeah.
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.520]  Yeah. Because nobody gets a harvest till late September, early October, mid October. Yeah.
[21:41.520 --> 21:46.400]  And that's what the 65 day strain, um, you know, so, and you're not going to worry about any cold.
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.080]  You're not going to get that freeze that everybody worries about, but you know, in our region,
[21:50.080 --> 21:55.040]  possibly a little bit in the early season, you can put plants back in there and re flower them.
[21:55.600 --> 22:01.840]  You can actually get two runs out of that. Yeah. Two runs easily. Um, I've seen three runs. Nice.
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.000]  So actually I've seen four runs, but that was with a forever flowering greenhouse. Yeah. Forever
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.040]  flowering. So a hoop house or a small greenhouse is the way to go. If you guys are trying to do
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.280]  this on a small level, the smallest level of light deprivation, I think you could do,
[22:15.280 --> 22:21.760]  put a couple of potted plants, uh, try to use a seven gallon or bigger at least. Yeah. At least.
[22:21.760 --> 22:25.040]  But I mean, some people, you know, this is for the guy that's just trying to do one plant for
[22:25.040 --> 22:28.720]  himself or whatever. Yeah. Put your seven gallon. A lot of guys are going to use a five gallon bucket
[22:28.720 --> 22:34.160]  from home Depot. You know, that's what they're going to go get 44. What's up 44. So 44, you take
[22:34.160 --> 22:38.720]  your, and 44 was kind of doing this last year. You take your five gallon home Depot bucket with
[22:38.720 --> 22:42.800]  your big ass plant in there. And every day at six o'clock or every day at seven o'clock, whatever
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.680]  time you choose, you got to pay attention to what time the sun goes down, uh, get that plant and go
[22:47.680 --> 22:51.920]  put it in a closet in the house. Just put it back in your girl room. Yeah. Put it in your girl room
[22:51.920 --> 22:56.400]  or whatever. It's a small operation. Yeah. Just put it in the room for the night and let it sleep
[22:56.400 --> 23:00.560]  every night at the same time. And then it has to go back outside under the sun every night or every
[23:00.560 --> 23:05.200]  day at the same time. As long as you give that plant 12 hours of consistent 12 hours of darkness
[23:05.200 --> 23:10.240]  uninterrupted every night, you can do a light depth like that and use the sun and a closet
[23:10.240 --> 23:15.760]  for your grow area. Here's the trick too. Um, you don't actually have to, uh, put it back out at the
[23:15.760 --> 23:22.800]  same time. Just have to wait for, um, you know, 10, 11 o'clock at night, you know, safe time,
[23:22.800 --> 23:30.480]  uh, sun completely down, no lumens, um, and then use a, uh, use your farmer's almond act to find
[23:30.480 --> 23:36.400]  out what time the sun goes up that morning. And typically you're probably getting your first
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.920]  actual, this is from, uh, Jonathan, a forever flowering. Actually, I'm not this smart, but,
[23:41.920 --> 23:48.400]  um, you get your first lumens probably before the sun actually comes up. Yes. So, you know,
[23:48.400 --> 23:55.760]  take 20 minutes off that time. Um, but yeah, that's, uh, I've done it before the old fashion
[23:55.760 --> 24:01.680]  or the, the other way of, you know, seven and seven and it's very tedious. Yeah. Yeah. So you
[24:01.680 --> 24:05.600]  can take it back outside guys, bring it in. Uh, if the sun's going to set at eight o'clock, bring
[24:05.600 --> 24:09.920]  that plan in at seven o'clock, let it chill out before you go to bed at 11 or 12, go put it back
[24:09.920 --> 24:13.520]  outside. Cause it's nighttime or you got to find out what time the sun's going to come up. You know,
[24:13.520 --> 24:18.080]  it's going to be six 37 o'clock in the summer, probably exactly where you are. Yeah. Yeah. So
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.680]  that's a good, good idea right there. And that's basically free. Yeah. You got to buy a pot, a big
[24:23.680 --> 24:27.200]  ass pot. You got to buy some soil. You got to buy some Rocky mountain worms. You got to buy some
[24:27.200 --> 24:31.840]  grow Kashi. You need some dragonfly earth medicine. A lot of cool other shit. Some as a mite a little
[24:31.840 --> 24:35.120]  bit makes that up. Sean's going to teach you what to put in your soil in a couple episodes, put all
[24:35.120 --> 24:41.280]  that shit in a pot, put a nice clone of some grateful dog in there, throw that sucker outside.
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.680]  Yep. You can do it. That's free weed. Um, I mean, you could use a garage, a shed, you know,
[24:47.680 --> 24:52.800]  anything, if it's just a couple of plants, old grow tent. I've seen people take a big ass trash
[24:52.800 --> 24:56.400]  can. If you've got a little plant, you take a little big 30 something gallon trash can drill
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.000]  some holes in the bottom of it so that you got airflow and then just set that bitch right on top
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.560]  of it. I've seen him do that for hail storms, but also seen him do that for a shitty light depth.
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.320]  It'll work. I mean, I'm sure it'd work. It'll work. It's not going to be, you know, it's not
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.160]  going to be the most amazing, but it's what you got. So, uh, do you want to teach these guys how
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.320]  to do a hoop house? Yeah. Just like a quick, since you're, since you're the man with the hammer and
[25:16.320 --> 25:22.160]  all, uh, real simple one, it's just, you need a gravel pad or an elevated area. Um, I mean,
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.440]  you don't need it, but you need drainage. Uh, it keeps it from being a muddy mess.
[25:27.440 --> 25:34.960]  Jesus, I'm stoned again. Um, I made the mistake of not smoking all day before coming at Jeff's
[25:36.880 --> 25:41.760]  when you show up at my spot, it's dad time to get a pregame. Yeah. You got to warm up. Um,
[25:42.720 --> 25:48.080]  but yeah, I mean, take two by fours, lay them down on the ground, uh, screw them to each other,
[25:48.080 --> 25:54.480]  make a big rectangle, um, eight foot by let's say 12 foot. Um, so you need two,
[25:55.120 --> 26:01.600]  eight foot, two by fours to 12 foot, two by fours, um, make a rectangle pretty much
[26:01.600 --> 26:08.800]  handful of screws, um, build that stake it to the ground. Um, lots of different ways to do that. Uh,
[26:09.360 --> 26:15.400]  piece of rebar or something, and then Nell, the, you know, Nell, the rebar to the, uh, um,
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.800]  to the two by four with a fence staple or something like that. Um, and then take you,
[26:22.800 --> 26:29.120]  let's see, eight or 12 foot. He's counting. He's doing, he's doing construction math. I'd say at
[26:29.120 --> 26:38.800]  least six, uh, pieces of, um, at least two inch PVC, um, would need to be
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.680]  at least 12 or 14 foot long, I think to make the entire hoop over. Okay. Um,
[26:46.560 --> 26:52.720]  and at the front you'll screw, basically you're just going to bend the PVC into hoop. Yeah.
[26:52.720 --> 26:57.120]  And do I have circle? Yeah. So you're making kind of a, it just looks like a really cheap greenhouse.
[26:57.120 --> 27:03.840]  Yeah. Yeah. And then you'll use some clamps, um, uh, like some conduit clamps. You can even just
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.720]  screw straight through the PVC into the, but I mean, you got to secure it to the two by four somehow.
[27:09.360 --> 27:17.760]  So, um, for a 12 foot greenhouse, I'd put up four of those pieces of PVC or four hoops,
[27:17.760 --> 27:23.680]  and then use one as a skeleton beam down the middle that that would be at the peak, um,
[27:23.680 --> 27:29.280]  attach it with zip ties or something like that. Um, if you're in a really windy area, um,
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.760]  you'll probably want to beef up your material a little, um, like the front range Colorado.
[27:36.720 --> 27:42.720]  Um, and then, you know, just throw some plastic over it and, uh, boom, you got a greenhouse.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.880]  It's pretty simple. Some thin see-through plastic right over it. Yeah. Yeah. And then you've got
[27:48.880 --> 27:54.080]  a weatherproof weather resistant greenhouse. Yeah. And then, um, so now you basically built
[27:54.080 --> 27:59.200]  this big rectangle, you've secured the rectangle to the ground. Uh, and then we took PVC and made
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.640]  arches and then you just made one, two, three, four. So arches, and you got one at each end and
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.160]  then a couple in the middle. And then you take that one right down the center. Yeah. And then
[28:08.160 --> 28:13.680]  we just drape plastic and secure the plastic at each on the bottom on each side. And then, uh,
[28:13.680 --> 28:16.800]  do you let it hang and you get, make some on the front and back too, or do you just leave the front
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.040]  back open? If you're wanting to do it cheap, I just really recommend leaving them open. Okay.
[28:21.040 --> 28:24.400]  Airflow. You get some airflow in there. Yeah. You're not going to get, unless it rains totally
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.760]  sideways, you should be legit, right? Yeah. I mean, you can have the plastic, uh, now that
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.000]  greenhouse is good all year, right? Like you can use that for, if you don't want to do light depth,
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.360]  that's a perfect cheap little hoop house. You can produce a bunch of cannabis in there and
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.640]  eight by 12, you can put a lot of pots in there. Yeah. A lot. Okay. So guys get, get some seeds
[28:42.640 --> 28:45.920]  going or get some clones cut now because you're going to want to get these suckers outside pretty
[28:45.920 --> 28:51.840]  soon. Yeah. Like this is real time stuff. Uh, bedroom inside. Uh, we haven't actually addressed
[28:51.840 --> 28:58.400]  this, uh, but bedroom inside to the size that you would normally flip a plant, um, or even
[28:58.400 --> 29:04.720]  fucking bigger, um, top them a few times. Femmum if you can't, our light depth plants are fucking
[29:04.720 --> 29:11.280]  guy near gigantic. I mean, um, and they're terpy, they taste good. They're as big as an outdoor
[29:11.280 --> 29:17.200]  plant. Um, when it's start starts flowering outdoors, you know, an in-ground traditional
[29:17.200 --> 29:24.800]  or natural, uh, light cycle plant. So that's, I mean, the yield is, uh, I'm not gonna say numbers,
[29:24.800 --> 29:29.520]  but it's, it's very much worth it. Oh, if you do it right. Yeah. This will definitely pay for
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.320]  itself. Definitely. And that outdoor cannabis is so good. It's definitely good. It tastes good.
[29:34.320 --> 29:40.400]  It's well-grown and then, uh, sun does amazing things. Greenhouse cannabis, uh, you know,
[29:40.400 --> 29:46.240]  it has been protected from the wind and rain. So it's a lot more frosty or, uh, looks a little
[29:46.240 --> 29:53.040]  more like indoor weed. Yeah. I think greenhouse weed is my favorite. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I,
[29:53.040 --> 29:58.080]  I honestly prefer it to indoor. Sun turps. Exactly. You can't match that sun. Yeah. And
[29:58.080 --> 30:02.240]  that controlled environment. All right. So we've got this hoop house and it's pretty much weather
[30:02.240 --> 30:06.640]  resistant. It's eight by 12. Uh, how tall does it usually end up about seven, eight feet tall?
[30:06.640 --> 30:10.720]  That's usually about where we are. Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, the one I was thinking of in my head
[30:10.720 --> 30:14.160]  would be about seven feet tall. Yeah. I've been in the one that I'm pretty much been in one that
[30:14.160 --> 30:17.440]  you've built. I've been in two that were side by side. Yeah. I know exactly what we're dealing
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.440]  with here. You can get some big ass being your plants can finish seven feet tall in here. You
[30:21.520 --> 30:29.440]  can get gigantic with this. I've seen some guys in NorCal. Um, I mean, they have scissor lifts to,
[30:29.440 --> 30:33.600]  uh, pull the plastic over and shit like that. They're, I mean, just, all right. So that's the
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.280]  part we're going to have to talk about. Now we're trying to make this light depth. So we're going
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.640]  to put our plants out there when they're waist high ish, maybe a little higher, maybe I'm tall.
[30:42.640 --> 30:48.560]  So I can't really judge by that, I guess when they're about 36 to 42 inches tall, you want to
[30:48.560 --> 30:53.760]  start inducing flower. And now we can't just flip the light. Like we used to indoors to 12, 12.
[30:53.760 --> 30:57.760]  Now we've got to do it. Like Jesse was saying, we've got to use some sort of cover. We got to
[30:57.760 --> 31:02.640]  use some kind of tarp. So you need, if you've got, if your greenhouse is 12 feet long and eight feet
[31:02.640 --> 31:06.160]  wide, you're going to need like 12 by 12, at least to cover it because that arch is going to take a
[31:06.160 --> 31:12.160]  lot more space, probably 12 by 15 or so. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So just get a 15 by 15 tarp. Does
[31:12.160 --> 31:18.240]  that you have plenty of coverage? Um, yeah. And make sure it's actually, uh, it actually blocks
[31:18.240 --> 31:24.560]  out the sun. Yeah. You might have to use two layers. Um, I have used, I get green tarps, um,
[31:24.560 --> 31:31.920]  cause of the green spectrum, uh, supposedly, you know, um, I don't know if that's actually,
[31:31.920 --> 31:35.760]  yeah. I don't know about the science behind that. That's just, I was standing in there and I was
[31:35.760 --> 31:41.360]  like, Hmm, green tarp. So the point is to keep out all of the light because you need it dark.
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.760]  So whatever time you pick every night, if you pick seven o'clock, you got to figure out what
[31:45.760 --> 31:49.840]  time the sun's going to come up. But if you pick seven o'clock, you got to go out to this hoop house
[31:49.840 --> 31:55.600]  every night and cover it up with a tarp. So it's completely dark. The first few times you do it,
[31:55.600 --> 32:00.560]  go in there and hang out, wait for like 40 minutes, just lay down and hang out for a little
[32:00.560 --> 32:05.360]  bit, close your eyes and adjust to the dark. And if you can see any light, if you can see any light
[32:05.360 --> 32:09.920]  in there, it's too much light. You got to make it darker. I continuously do that through the season.
[32:10.400 --> 32:16.880]  Yeah. So it's, um, with tarps and cheaper material, I mean, forever flowering makes
[32:16.880 --> 32:21.280]  really nice stuff. Yeah. If you've got, if you've got some money to spend in some land to put it on
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.040]  check out forever flowering greenhouses. Well, yeah, but it's not your backyard setup though.
[32:25.040 --> 32:28.800]  You can get just the greenhouse fabrics from them and they're sweet and they're actually not too
[32:28.800 --> 32:33.520]  expensive. Uh, I'm going to do it this year. Um, and they also have a blackout tarp that's
[32:33.520 --> 32:39.280]  breathable. So, um, you know, that's, and it's not too much just order the tarp from them. Um,
[32:40.160 --> 32:47.520]  so if you can afford that, that, um, otherwise, yeah, yeah, please. We want hats.
[32:48.880 --> 32:56.320]  I'm trying to close a deal for you, man. Um, but, uh, uh, damn, I lost my train of thought
[32:56.320 --> 33:00.640]  thinking about their bitching hats, covering it up, getting dark. Oh yeah. The cheap plastic,
[33:00.640 --> 33:06.960]  it's going to tear throughout the season. Um, so, you know, uh, continuously check it,
[33:06.960 --> 33:14.800]  have extra plastic. Um, I put plastic, I put the tarp and then plastic over it. So, um, to make
[33:14.800 --> 33:18.720]  sure I get a total blackout. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So you can't have any light in there. That's our
[33:18.720 --> 33:23.920]  point guys. So every night, this is the whole time you're doing this every night, somebody,
[33:23.920 --> 33:27.920]  hopefully you, hopefully you've got the dedication. Somebody has got to go out there every night and
[33:27.920 --> 33:32.400]  make this shit dark. And then every morning you have to go out there and turn the lights on by
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.160]  uncovering it. And you're going to get some air. You're going to have to get airflow in there while
[33:36.160 --> 33:40.080]  it's covered up. So think about a way to, to get airflow in there while you're covered. You might
[33:40.080 --> 33:46.880]  need a fan towards the floor. Get some air in and out. A trick I use for that is, um, this also
[33:46.880 --> 33:52.000]  helps keep everything secure. Sean's dedicated. He just pulled out forever flower stickers. Oh,
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.720]  nice. And a business card. There you go. Yeah. Help you get in touch with them for sure. Tell
[33:56.720 --> 34:04.640]  them. Yeah. I sent you. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I met him once kind of, so yeah. Yeah. But yeah.
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.160]  In a dad session. Um, it was, uh, when they were through the greener side one time,
[34:10.160 --> 34:18.320]  uh, no smoking allowed there. Yeah. Oh yeah. Of course. Um, but, uh, uh, uh, shit, I lost my train
[34:18.320 --> 34:22.880]  of thought. You're good at that dude. Was that like some sativa or something in those tabs?
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.600]  Uh, yes, that was actually some lemon Jeffrey sour diesel. Dad's gotta warn me about that.
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.200]  I'm not a sativa smoker. You are today. I'm sitting here losing my shit, man. He's kind
[34:33.200 --> 34:38.400]  of wiggling around. Yeah. Yeah. It's so hard to sit still. You guys would be proud of me. That's,
[34:38.400 --> 34:41.760]  that's why I couldn't sleep last night. I was dabbing this stuff, just going, I'm trying to
[34:41.760 --> 34:48.080]  get tired and it's not working. He's dabbing it. Yeah. I'm totally an Indica guy. Okay. I'll
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.360]  remember that. Um, shit, I lost my train of thought. That's going to be the name of this
[34:53.360 --> 34:59.120]  episode. Jesse lost his train of thought. Oh, but yeah, no, just, uh, I'll remember. Uh, light
[34:59.120 --> 35:02.880]  depth is awesome. You were just kind of talking about what fabric and stuff you were going to
[35:02.880 --> 35:12.800]  ventilation. Um, I'll take a booster fan, like a 10 inch or 12 inch one. Um, and hook the ducting
[35:12.800 --> 35:16.960]  to it. Um, tie it to the side of the greenhouse. So it's up off the ground. It doesn't suck any
[35:16.960 --> 35:22.400]  dirt or anything into the fan. Um, set that on the floor of the greenhouse, uh, plug it in,
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.960]  pull your tarp, uh, hook to that, have like a six foot chunk of ducting and pull that out,
[35:28.960 --> 35:34.240]  wrap the plastic around it. There you go. And make it do a couple S's on the ground and all
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.760]  that good stuff. Yeah. The S's are sort of the light comes in. You got to bend your ducting,
[35:37.760 --> 35:40.800]  keep the lights out. I know everybody tells you to keep your ducting straight, but at this time
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.360]  you got to bend it. That's how you keep light out. And that puts a, um, negative pressure on
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.240]  the greenhouse to help suck the tarp nice and tight. Yeah. If you've got it sealed up good.
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.640]  Okay. Yeah. That's a good idea. Uh, use some, uh, some timbers, rocks, whatever that is,
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.800]  or whatever, um, to hold the tarp down. Um, you know, once you pull it over, uh,
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.080]  you can have sandbags, um, but that'll be on the edges on the ground,
[36:08.080 --> 36:12.720]  something heavy enough to keep wind from taking your tarp away, um, giving you sunlight when you
[36:12.720 --> 36:18.800]  don't need it. And then like squeeze clamps from Harbor freight, like, uh, big old alligator clips.
[36:20.800 --> 36:29.040]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, use those to, uh, help secure it all to the PVC frame. Um, and also
[36:29.040 --> 36:34.800]  close up the ends, uh, wrapped the plastic real tight and clamp the, uh, clamps on them. Yeah.
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.080]  All right. We've got a sweet structure. We've got some cover. We've got some airflow.
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.640]  Um, you can do the exact opposite. We've got some big ass plants to go in there. Hopefully you got
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.160]  some good IRI genetics or some gauge green genetics or something to put in there. That'd
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.040]  be pretty sweet. Um, you can do the opposite with this. Also, you guys, if you're trying to keep
[36:51.040 --> 36:56.640]  your growing season going longer, you can put lights in this greenhouse too, uh, which sounds
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.640]  strange, but sometimes your plants are going to flower earlier than you want them to in some areas.
[37:00.640 --> 37:04.320]  If you're in a warmer place and then you can keep it going and then you may have to add a heater
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.360]  later in the season. But if you're trying to get two grows out of it, like we were talking about
[37:07.440 --> 37:10.000]  you can pull off that light depth, grow, hang up a couple of lights,
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.800]  veg some plants in there. All you have to do when the sun goes down at night,
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.400]  just turn on one or two lights and those will keep your plants awake so that they don't go
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.560]  into flower. And when you're ready, just take the lights down. Then you can get that whole other.
[37:20.560 --> 37:24.400]  It can just be CFLs too. It doesn't have to be enough to keep them awake. They don't have to
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.240]  stay on all the time. You can just walk through every couple of hours with a light and it'll
[37:28.240 --> 37:31.440]  wake them up for sure. And just disrupt that. And they won't hurt him out because they're
[37:31.440 --> 37:34.720]  out in the sun like that. And they'll be cool. So that's a good way to get two full harvests
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.320]  out of this cheap, you're going to have to put a heater in there by the end of the season if you do
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.880]  it that way, but you'll get two full crops out of this. And if you're doing 18 by, or are we doing
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.000]  12 by eight? Yeah. 12 by eight. You can fit quite a few plants in there. We don't want to get you
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.760]  hyped up on numbers, but. Yeah. Well, it depends on your container size and your plant size too.
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.040]  Right. But if you're eight feet wide, you can do either two or three pots.
[37:57.040 --> 38:01.360]  Yeah. I mean, cram them in there. Two or three. There's no need to have a walk space. If you need
[38:01.360 --> 38:06.880]  to get in there, just pull the plants out. I mean, it's fricking outdoors. So, um, you know,
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.880]  that's a, you like to army crawl through your rooms. I'm big and clumsy. I leave a little bit
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.600]  of dreadlock space or I'll get a dreadlock hung up on a branch or something. And that's 96 square
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.760]  foot of biomass. If you do it right. So topping lots of training, get the plants going. All right.
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.960]  96 square feet of tops. I feel like that's a decent start on light depth. I'm sure you guys
[38:26.960 --> 38:31.760]  will have questions. So that's what you got to do. You got to email me or Facebook or something,
[38:31.760 --> 38:35.520]  me, Twitter me. Uh, I grow quote notes grow from your heart at hotmail. I won't say that anymore.
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.360]  I'm sorry. That's a bad habit. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Uh, it's at GFYH podcast on
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.320]  Twitter. It's grow from your heart on Facebook. Uh, you can Instagram me. You can call me if you
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.560]  know me. It's funny. Cause I'll get like text messages. Just listen. What's up? And I'm like,
[38:50.560 --> 38:53.600]  Oh, you got to, you should email me or something. It feels weird getting it this way.
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.080]  Jesse grows on Instagram. Yeah. I'm kind of bad about answering direct messages, but, uh,
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.920]  I swear I'll do it. One of these. No, I normally get to them. I'm just not very timely. So it may
[39:05.920 --> 39:09.760]  take me a week, but I'll get to you. Yeah. I got to sit down and answer just all of my emails and
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.600]  Facebook and Instagram direct messages. One of these days just go right through it and empty
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.800]  out the inbox. It takes work though. Yeah. And then you assign yourself tasks when you do it.
[39:18.800 --> 39:21.600]  Yes, I can do this for you. And then you're like, Oh, there's more work to do. And then you're like,
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.560]  Oh, there's more work. I'm already kind of, I'm already working.
[39:28.240 --> 39:34.000]  Light dev takes a lot of dedication and commitment. So it's like ninja status,
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.160]  but for the cost of the supplies, the time you're going to do it, you don't have to pay for any
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.960]  electricity and the sun is free. As long as you're reliable with getting out and covering and
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.760]  uncovering every day and not letting, uh, keeping the airflow in there and not letting it get
[39:47.760 --> 39:53.200]  stagnant in there. You should be cool. I think. Yeah. Um, I think when Sean comes to talk about
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.360]  his soil recycling, we'll talk a little bit about keeping bugs away. Unless you guys want to talk
[39:57.360 --> 40:05.680]  about bugs and the outdoor right now. I mean, um, prevention. Yeah. Cause prevention, let's go for
[40:05.680 --> 40:10.080]  it. Talk about, yeah. How are we going to keep bugs away? Actually. Okay. I had a friend ask me,
[40:10.160 --> 40:17.360]  um, about caterpillars last night. So, um, and there's not a lot you can do about them.
[40:17.360 --> 40:23.280]  Um, once it happens, it's, you know, manual labor, pick them out, um, cut away the rock.
[40:23.280 --> 40:27.360]  You got to call manual and have them come pick it up for you. That's a Pueblo thing.
[40:27.920 --> 40:33.360]  That is a local joke. Sorry. I actually used to know a guy. He, uh, he told everyone that was
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.200]  his name and his first name actually was manual. So how do we keep the caterpillars from getting
[40:39.200 --> 40:46.720]  into the grow? Um, I believe I was told those little fuckers lay their eggs about three weeks
[40:46.720 --> 40:54.720]  before you actually see them. Um, so that's when it's still pretty early bud growth. Um, you know,
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.640]  especially outdoors, they're still stretching a lot at that point. Um, there's just little
[40:58.640 --> 41:06.560]  popcorn nugs on shit. Um, so, uh, Spinosad is something I had great success with last year.
[41:07.280 --> 41:10.480]  I got it in a Monterey spray. Yeah. Monterey bug spray.
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.320]  No, actually we don't have that one. I think I bought it there.
[41:17.200 --> 41:24.080]  Well, we had the captain Jack's now too, which actually has more Spinosad in it than Monterey,
[41:24.080 --> 41:33.120]  I believe. So, um, uh, Neem oil, although, um, I mean, Neem oil works great. So yeah.
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.360]  How do you feel about Spinosad? It's a, it's actually a bacteria found in the bottle of rum,
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.880]  uh, barrels. Yeah. I think it's, it's good to be used. It needs to be, it's something to be used
[41:42.880 --> 41:48.560]  strategically. Like Jesse was saying, it needs to be well-planned, thought out, talk to other people,
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.880]  figure out when they usually see these problems. That's a good way to put my thoughts on Neem oil
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.760]  too. Strategically. Yeah. You don't just spray willy nilly. I mean, you want to, you want to
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.080]  apply for reasons at certain times, you know, you want to get in tune with your environment.
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.280]  That's where I feel about that. I mean, you, you, you want to utilize everything that you can.
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.720]  There's, you don't have too many options, especially here in Pueblo with our extreme
[42:12.720 --> 42:20.000]  weather and a variety of past. It's amazing. Yeah. Well, yes, you're high and dry. If I was a
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.720]  spider mite, I don't want to live here. Um, outdoors. The only one don't say those words.
[42:25.680 --> 42:32.000]  Here. I mean, I've seen crops here completely wrecked by, uh, here goes organics again. I've
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.520]  seen crops here completely wrecked by spider mites and powdery mold. And I've never had an issue with
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.200]  them personally. Um, I've found that, you know, occasionally you'll have some when the plants
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.680]  come out in the spring and they're very easy to deal with. Um, uh, a little Neem oil, um, maybe
[42:49.680 --> 42:59.200]  some, uh, uh, like lemongrass based, uh, water, uh, you know, very easy to deal with most of the
[42:59.200 --> 43:05.280]  bugs just don't like water. Yeah. Um, moisture, the gardens I've seen wrecked by them are new or
[43:05.280 --> 43:10.240]  bottle fed. Um, they're pouring fucking chelated nutrients into the earth. You know,
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.560]  the big problem is, is it's usually in, it comes in two situations, either a,
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.600]  they don't do anything about it and then they just get the infestation. And then that's usually
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.600]  where they want to come in and treat with like an Eagle 20 or Tetra Zan or something like that.
[43:26.400 --> 43:34.240]  Um, or the other situation is, is that they'll actually use those things on a regular basis
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.720]  as a preventative. Uh, the plant builds no sort of self immune system. You know, you're all,
[43:40.720 --> 43:45.200]  you're doing it for it. The second that you forget, or the second that that insect builds
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.880]  up a resistance, you've lost the war. So yeah, the trick is prevention. You want to go at it.
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.080]  Really? You want to go at it systemically. You want to add in neem cake and crustacean meal,
[43:56.080 --> 44:01.520]  things like that into your soil mix. You want to plan out spray regiments of neem oil,
[44:01.520 --> 44:09.040]  uh, essential oils, like he was saying, uh, lemongrass, uh, peppermint oil, uh, rosemary,
[44:09.040 --> 44:14.320]  rosemary kills spider mites eggs on contacts. Um, so if you, if you see a little bit of an
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.240]  infestation, your first thing is to go and remove any stippled, you know, anything with
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.640]  stippling and then go back through and hit them with some rosemary oil. What's your thoughts on
[44:22.640 --> 44:30.320]  this? Um, I have rosemary growing in my yard. Um, how would I go about just taking the raw plant
[44:30.320 --> 44:36.320]  and utilizing that into, uh, so you can go a couple of ways. So there's either a, you can
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.880]  make it like a traditional essential oil, which is, I have no idea how to do that.
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.640]  That's just a quick Google search. It's really not that hard. It's just kind of like you,
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.440]  you know, you mix it, sit and forget it. You know, you might have to apply some heat to it
[44:51.440 --> 44:56.400]  or things like that. The other option would be like a cold process, kind of like a ferment to
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.680]  kind of extract those essential oils. So that would be more like a fermented plant juice.
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.360]  So then you would go, that would go back to like the Korean natural farming that I kind of do,
[45:05.360 --> 45:11.680]  where you would take the rosemary or whatever plant you would want, mix it in. Yeah. Basil.
[45:12.560 --> 45:20.960]  Honestly, you could do mixtures of them all. I do, uh, personally I do ginger, garlic, cinnamon
[45:20.960 --> 45:27.200]  sticks, and then I'll grind all of that up, mix it in with the indigenous microorganism and EM1.
[45:27.920 --> 45:33.360]  And yeah, that's usually how I'll create a little, you know, spray off of that. I also have a,
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.440]  damn, I bet that smells amazing. It does. Like my girlfriend actually likes that when I spray it in
[45:39.440 --> 45:45.760]  the house. Um, but yeah, so yeah, damn, I'm like, forget what I'm saying too. Man, we got to smoke
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.400]  different dabs next time. I'm sorry. We only took one or two dabs and everybody looked at me like,
[45:50.400 --> 45:56.400]  I'm high, let's podcast. Uh, so preventatives, the stuff you mix up. So yeah, you just want to,
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.120]  uh, preventative, preventatives are key. So you want to plan out your neem sprays,
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.880]  your essential oil sprays, uh, your Spinosy, anything that you're going to use, you want to
[46:06.880 --> 46:10.880]  make sure that you have it planned out on a calendar when you're going to use it before you
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.200]  go. If you're going to make things like I was saying, you want to make sure that you give
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.320]  yourself a month or two in advance. So you can make them and they'll be ready. Cause these are,
[46:20.320 --> 46:24.640]  you know, 30 day ferments. Right. And making worm casting teas and things has taught me to plan
[46:24.640 --> 46:30.640]  several days ahead. Exactly. You have to start it, you know, 12 to 48 hours before you're actually
[46:30.640 --> 46:34.960]  going to apply it before it's even useful. Yep. Get that foamy layer, which when you, when you
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.280]  get used to it, it actually is kind of turns out to be a lot easier because you know, you're like,
[46:39.280 --> 46:43.360]  well, I'm on your way out of the garden and you start this tea up and you'll hit it the next day
[46:43.360 --> 46:49.120]  with it. So it works out like that. I'm getting away from the bottles. Thank you. You guys are
[46:49.120 --> 46:52.960]  doing it for me. So we got some hoop house action, kind of got some ideas on how to keep away the
[46:52.960 --> 46:59.120]  bugs. Uh, what was the one thing you talk about a lot? Karanja meal? So yeah, so there's neem and
[46:59.280 --> 47:05.680]  there's Karanja. They're the same thing. You hear a lot of people talk about like a neem and Karanja
[47:05.680 --> 47:13.440]  50 50 mix. It's really unnecessary. The big difference is that like neem oil technically
[47:13.440 --> 47:21.200]  has a, like a, what's the word I'm looking for? Uh, almost like birth control style, uh,
[47:21.920 --> 47:29.040]  properties to it, which for human health reasons and Karanja oil doesn't. So that's kind of my
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.040]  basic understanding is that they're the same thing. Basically Karanja oil is a hell of a lot cheaper
[47:35.040 --> 47:40.960]  to source, uh, or at least Karanja meal. Uh, I can't, I've never personally used Karanja oil
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.160]  specifically, but the, uh, it's basically the same thing as neem. Okay. You got me curious about
[47:46.160 --> 47:53.120]  these birth control properties now. Yeah. I won't ask. Oh, if you really want some birth control
[47:53.200 --> 47:59.200]  properties, go use Eagle 20. I'll make you stare. It'll make you twitch. You won't get
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.080]  late at all because your eyes are twitching. Yeah, definitely. Birth control right there.
[48:04.080 --> 48:07.360]  All right. I wanted to see if I got over all the stuff we wrote down. Cause if we're coming up on
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.040]  50 minutes, I'm trying to keep this about an hour. I've noticed we get a lot more lessons when we go
[48:11.040 --> 48:17.360]  like 50 instead of a 70, like we ran out of our attentions. Oh, what are we going to say?
[48:18.080 --> 48:21.280]  Part of my problem is I'm over here making notes and reading shit. You guys are just high.
[48:23.200 --> 48:26.640]  Let's see. We got over that. We got over all the stuff that I wrote down on this page.
[48:26.640 --> 48:29.760]  Uh, I promised you guys I'll get you a coupon code at the end of the episode. I'll throw that in
[48:29.760 --> 48:35.600]  right at the end. Um, man, one of the cool words I learned today, nutritive cycle theory. I like
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.360]  that. It's good. I wrote that down. I'm going to have to do that again and read more about that.
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.000]  I said, do that again. What am I going to do? Yeah, exactly. No, I just made that up.
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.240]  That's new to me too. I've got a couple of posts up about it on my feed and then
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.880]  Rocky mountain natural farming's page. I've got a little post about it up.
[48:54.880 --> 48:58.880]  Guys, make sure you check out the Rocky mountain natural farming and the Rocky mountain worm
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.360]  company. Check those guys out, all their internet stuff. You will learn so much. Put on the podcast,
[49:03.360 --> 49:09.200]  put in some headphones and go type in Rocky mountain worm company and just find, just click
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.520]  on links and see where you end up and see what you learn. Anything you read on there is useful.
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.200]  So just read it all. And then when you have a question, just comment and ask.
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.520]  Yes. And I'll bring Sean back. I'll be like, this guy asked this question and Sean will come and
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.720]  he'll say, this is the answer. Young Jedi. And we'll all learn to grow like a pro here organically.
[49:26.720 --> 49:35.600]  And every bit of this applies to your gardens to, um, corn tomatoes, uh, all that good stuff too.
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.520]  Yeah. Yeah. We use worm castings on all of it. Yeah. This is not just pot. Yeah. I'm glad that,
[49:41.520 --> 49:44.960]  and you don't have to buy everything at the hydro store either. There's their other store. And I
[49:45.120 --> 49:48.880]  say that since, you know, the hydro shop is a sponsor, but you can go to the farming store and
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.600]  the regular grow store. There's a nursery around here that sells, uh, grow supplies, but they don't
[49:53.600 --> 49:57.440]  have any grow lights or anything, but they've got lots of great amendments and things. It's a garden
[49:57.440 --> 50:02.320]  supply store. You can go to those places too. You guys don't be afraid. Uh, agriculture, horticulture
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.280]  stores, supply stores, your local economy. Yeah. They know why you're there. Don't rub it in their
[50:07.280 --> 50:13.200]  face. That's just a garden store, man. Yeah. Well, if you're on that level, buying that stuff,
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.040]  you know, the etiquette by now, anyway, I hope if you're listening to us, we don't have to remind
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.480]  you to not walk into the garden store. My weed plants need more nitrogen, bro. No, go in there
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.640]  and just be at our local one. I've seen more than one person get kicked out of there. They'll
[50:26.640 --> 50:31.520]  completely make you leave. I'm like, man, I'm here for the exact same thing, but you know, I'm not a
[50:31.520 --> 50:37.520]  dick. So yeah, they know we smoked the joint in the car on the way. So we smelled lovely and they're
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.160]  like, Oh, what's up, man. Um, before I forget, I wrote down this, a big shout out to lens, big
[50:42.160 --> 50:46.480]  shout out to Judy, big shout out to dreadful J and also everyone to, or shout out to everyone
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.200]  from bonk TV. You guys been listening to the show. I appreciate that. Um, that's something
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.000]  important that I wrote down cause I'm high and forgetful today. Um, we're going to wrap it up.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.520]  Do you guys have any final magnificent words of wisdom towards the end of the show here?
[51:02.160 --> 51:07.520]  Uh, grow meeting March 6th at high grow March 6th. Yeah. I'm going to write that down because
[51:07.520 --> 51:13.440]  I'm forgetful today. I lost my pen. How did, what's going on? I'll be sure to be there for
[51:13.440 --> 51:20.720]  that one for sure. Yeah. Let us, uh, I don't have a topic. Um, I did have a topic, but, um,
[51:21.440 --> 51:28.400]  I don't know how, yeah. Um, give me a new one, uh, throw, throw us an ideal. So, yeah. All right.
[51:28.400 --> 51:33.760]  Yeah. So new grow, uh, the next grow meeting and hydro indoor growing supplies in Pueblo,
[51:33.760 --> 51:38.960]  March 6th, 2015. I will be there. I'm pretty sure I'll be there. I don't see any reason why
[51:38.960 --> 51:43.600]  I wouldn't be unless fish comes to town or something. I'll be there. Jesse will be there.
[51:43.600 --> 51:47.920]  Sean will be there. Uh, we'll get a lot of cool people there. Come meet us. You guys, Armando V
[51:47.920 --> 51:53.440]  Hill. This is your personal invitation. We wanted to hang out and meet you for a while. Come down,
[51:53.440 --> 51:58.080]  bro. All the people that have been trying to hang out with us, uh, us growers can't leave. We're
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.960]  kind of nerds and, uh, hermits and we stay at home and grow weed all day. And then, uh, we do,
[52:02.960 --> 52:07.520]  we got to do at work and then we go home and grow more weed. But, uh, so come hang out with us at
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.120]  these grower meetings because we've just committed to be in there. We'll all be there all at once.
[52:11.120 --> 52:14.000]  We're going to teach you a bunch of stuff. We're going to learn a bunch of stuff. It'll be fun.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.560]  And just added it into the calendar, man. It's that, Oh, it's official now. It's official.
[52:18.560 --> 52:22.560]  Jesse will put it on Facebook and I will make it super official. Facebook official.
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.240]  Dun dun dun. Uh, February 27th, we're going to do another free tea day. Uh, cool. We had a
[52:28.240 --> 52:33.600]  great response from that. So, and request to do it again. So I was like, Oh, all right.
[52:33.600 --> 52:38.240]  I saw the TB and brood. It looked perfect. It was marvelous. Did you mix that yourself?
[52:38.240 --> 52:44.080]  Yeah. Good job, bro. Rocky mountain earthworm castings and molasses. That's all you need. Oh,
[52:44.080 --> 52:50.080]  I put a little off alpha. There you go. Minuscule amount. So make it bubbly. Yeah.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.520]  Make it bubbly. Show me what you're warming with. Yeah. That shit was, yeah.
[52:53.600 --> 52:57.360]  Oh, this is going to get out of hand if we do the worm puns again.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.920]  All right. You got any shout outs, dude? Uh, I mean, as always shout out to Rocky
[53:01.920 --> 53:07.200]  mountain worm company. Uh, you know, everybody who's helping us out over there, Alan, the big
[53:07.200 --> 53:12.000]  toker, Nick, you know, coming on last time and obviously you for having us. I really appreciate
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.720]  that. Thanks for coming on and giving me great content. Uh, you two are probably you guys and
[53:16.720 --> 53:21.280]  Clint are my most listened to guests. So this one's probably going to blow up since you're
[53:21.280 --> 53:25.760]  both here. It's like superhero status. What's up, Clint? Come do a show with us sometime.
[53:25.760 --> 53:30.320]  Yeah. Uh, Clint keeps us, he's like training wheels because he's, he doesn't know anything
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.160]  about Canada. Well, not like I'm not even being a Dick. He does not know shit about weed. He's
[53:34.160 --> 53:38.480]  like weed ignorant. So we'll be saying stuff and he'll look over at me like, why does all that
[53:38.480 --> 53:42.640]  mean? And then I got, Oh yeah, you're right. We should tell everybody what that means. Cause we
[53:42.640 --> 53:46.720]  just talked like pros and they're still learning with training wheels. Let's have them come ask us
[53:46.720 --> 53:53.120]  questions about organics beginner, you know, from a dude who doesn't even, you know, come quiz us,
[53:53.120 --> 53:57.840]  Clint, come ask us the stuff that we've talked to quickly over and lost people come remind us to
[53:57.840 --> 54:04.640]  slow down. We'll give you six questions. And then after that, we'll give you six dabs. He's never
[54:04.640 --> 54:09.120]  taken a dab before. So I don't want to know. I'm not ready to give a dude six dabs. No,
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.840]  my friend D said that he's coming to Colorado. He doesn't live in Colorado. And a friend told
[54:13.840 --> 54:18.480]  him that his first stab he's going to take is a gram dab. And I have been trying strongly to
[54:18.480 --> 54:23.440]  discourage that from happening, but he's insisting on taking a gram dab for his first try. Dude,
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.840]  don't do that. D's listen to my friends here. They don't know you and they advise against it.
[54:27.840 --> 54:31.360]  You're just going to hurt yourself. Yeah. I told him he's going to fuck up his whole day.
[54:31.360 --> 54:34.480]  Yeah. And then everybody's going to laugh at you. You're looking at asshole. You're going to have to
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.200]  eat and then go lay down and then wake up like 10 hours later and eat again. And you're going to
[54:39.200 --> 54:43.680]  cough for 30 minutes. You're going to look like an asshole. Don't do it. These are like shit for
[54:43.760 --> 54:49.520]  probably 30 hours. Yeah. See, and that's coming from three people that really smoke a lot of
[54:49.520 --> 54:55.280]  dads. Yeah. I've I do gram dabs and a gram dab is a big ass dad for me. That's my limit. Half gram
[54:55.280 --> 54:59.920]  is a little more than I want. Point three is comfortable like that's and that's a big dad.
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.600]  Most people do about point one. It's just dick waving. I'm sorry. Yeah, there's no need to do
[55:05.600 --> 55:12.960]  that. Yeah. I mean, Jeff has his reasons and and he's very aware that it's just dick waving. And
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.960]  I like to take dabs. I just like good at waving his dick. I like it when, when that dad,
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.400]  when you're not sure if you're going to come have a stroke, a little bit of a heart attack,
[55:21.040 --> 55:25.280]  or if you want to jump up and high five all your friends all at the same time from a dab. I love
[55:25.280 --> 55:29.760]  that feeling. That's and that's what a point five does to you. Cheerleader, dev cheerleader,
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.000]  dabs, cheerleader, dads, guys. When you take a big dab, your arms just start moving. Give me an
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.240]  a, give me a B and you're not even trying similar to the Josh blue. That was a straight from
[55:40.240 --> 55:44.800]  Facebook. Oh no. He left his ass. Yeah, that's true. Shout out to Josh blue. I've seen Josh a
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.840]  few times. He's hilarious. Yeah. Hilarious guys. I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff today.
[55:49.840 --> 55:53.360]  I hope you learned how to build your own outdoor hoop house. I hope you're going to build a hoop
[55:53.360 --> 55:56.800]  house in your backyard. I hope you're going to grow a whole bunch of cannabis. I hope you,
[55:56.800 --> 56:00.160]  your neighbors, their neighbors, their neighbors, and all your other neighbors are going to be like,
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.720]  damn whose weed smells so good because everybody is growing a big plot of outdoor cannabis this
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.440]  summer. That's what I want happens on a County road. I hang around on overgrow the government.
[56:09.440 --> 56:13.440]  They can't bust us all. They can't take down every crop. Grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow,
[56:13.440 --> 56:16.800]  grow some more. Teach a friend how to grow while you're teaching your friends how to grow. Teach
[56:16.800 --> 56:20.800]  one of your friends, teach, teach to your friends about the grow from your heart podcast. Cause if
[56:20.800 --> 56:25.120]  you teach one person, they'll get high and forget. If you tell two people, the chances are one of
[56:25.120 --> 56:28.720]  those people might come and listen to the show. So teach more people about the show while we're
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.920]  teaching everyone to grow weed. I think we're making them listen. Make your mom listen. That's
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.840]  funny. Grab your mom, make her listen to the podcast. She might be, she might think that
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.520]  weeds a devil and she'll listen to us. The only problems we had today was we all forgot what the
[56:41.520 --> 56:48.400]  hell we're talking about. Jesse needed extra water. I could already have ADHD, but I could
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.840]  barely sit. I'm having a very hard time sitting still right now. That's why you're like the
[56:53.840 --> 56:58.080]  construction guy. That's why you build shit all day. I gotta go. I gotta do stuff. I gotta build
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.920]  things. That's why I smoke Indica dude. All right. I'll do that too. Next time. No, it's all cool.
[57:04.480 --> 57:10.720]  I made these lemon Jeffrey dad. Someone had some sour diesel the other day and it was very good.
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.600]  Cousin Tater there. Shout out cousin Tater. Good cousin Tater. He's killing it. He's got a bunch of
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.720]  my genetics and he's been killing it with my stuff. He does well with my seeds. I'd give him a best
[57:20.720 --> 57:26.640]  new grower of the year that I know. So dun dun dun. And then Adam, let's get Adam that award this
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.680]  year. Let's make Adam the best new grower of the year. Most dedication. You gotta earn it bro. We're
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.360]  not giving it to you yet, but that's what we want from you. We want you to be best new grower that
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.880]  we know you're part of the grow crew now, like it or not. He does what he's told to do. He puts the
[57:40.880 --> 57:48.320]  lotion on the skin. No more whip for Adam again. I'm going to close the show with that, with all
[57:48.320 --> 57:52.320]  that nonsense. You guys, thanks for listening. You guys, thanks for coming, dude. I called Sean
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.080]  at like, I was like, can you be here in like a half hour for a podcast? And he's like, sure,
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.360]  no problem. So that was kind of cool. Jesse, thanks for coming, dude. I know you're a super
[57:59.360 --> 58:03.040]  busy guy. I appreciate you guys being here, teaching the world how to grow great cannabis,
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.520]  organic and sustainably. Guys, thank you for... Treat my mother right. That's right.
[58:07.520 --> 58:13.760]  And I treat your mother right too. Thanks for listening to the podcast, everybody.
[58:15.120 --> 58:18.320]  I promise the episodes are getting better and better. I've got more cool guests. People are
[58:18.320 --> 58:22.720]  reaching out to me to be on the show. I hear the guys from CannaVenture and Sour Seeds want to be
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.600]  on the show. The Dragonfly Earth Medicine people want to be on the show. We're going to get Alan
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.000]  from the Worm Company on here, like it or not. We'll duct tape him and drag him in here and make
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  him talk. I'm sure if I say, tell me about worms, he'll just start going. And that's all I need to
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.840]  do is just get him here. Keep listening, guys. They're getting better. I appreciate you for
[58:39.840 --> 58:44.240]  sticking through the weird winter episodes when things got chaotic. Now that the show's over,
[58:44.240 --> 58:48.800]  please go to iTunes or Stitcher, go to the iTunes store or Stitcher's weird. It's hard to find where
[58:48.800 --> 58:52.560]  to make comments, but just figure that out. Search for Grow From Your Heart, find the review section,
[58:52.560 --> 58:55.760]  give me a five-star rating. After that, type in a comment, let me know what you think of the show,
[58:55.760 --> 58:59.680]  and I will read your comments on the show. Stitcher keeps changing the way everything's
[58:59.680 --> 59:03.120]  done on there. I don't know why they keep doing that. It's hard to find a spot for comments.
[59:03.120 --> 59:07.120]  Sometimes it's hard for me to read the comments. If I can find them, I'll read them for you. Don't
[59:07.120 --> 59:10.240]  feel bad if I skip you on Stitcher. It's just that place is a pain in the ass. It's free,
[59:10.240 --> 59:14.400]  so I can't complain. That's where I listen to it at most of the time. We get a lot of good ratings
[59:14.400 --> 59:19.280]  on Stitcher. We were ranked, there are, you know, I kept saying 25,000. There are only 15,000 shows
[59:19.280 --> 59:24.720]  on Stitcher, but we were ranked 888 for a couple of episodes, around 50 in that time period. We
[59:24.800 --> 59:28.160]  were really kicking it. I haven't looked lately because I don't want to get too excited or
[59:28.160 --> 59:34.000]  disappointed, but 888 out of 15,000. That's more than another podcast that's on there.
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.480]  That's more than, yeah, for that week, we may have been the leading cannabis podcast.
[59:38.480 --> 59:41.680]  I bet. For that week. I'm not even dissing anybody. I'm just saying,
[59:41.680 --> 59:44.880]  holy shit, we've done that. Thank you guys for listening. You made that happen.
